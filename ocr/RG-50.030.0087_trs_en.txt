Q: Okay, Mr. Gruber would you please tell us your name ?   

 

A: Yes, My name  is Samuel Gruber.  

 

Q: And what was the name  that you used in Poland, during the time of the story that you are 
going to be sharing with us today?   
 

A: In the story they called me Mietek, it was a Polish name, it was a first name from Mietek, 
but Gruber. Mietek Gruber. But before the war they called me  Munyo. I was known Œ in 

my town I was called Œ name d Munyo Gruber. They called me  that.  
 

Q: And which town was that, that youŒ?   

 

A: My town is a small town in Galicia, name d Podhajce, not far from Lemberg. I went to 
school public there. Had my family, five people in the family, with my mother and father 

was seven. We  Œ one of my sisters in 1928 ma rried an American Œ came from America Œ 

American, and she come  over to America with him and she was here. And I reme mbered 

her Œ his number here, address and being in a Œ as a prisoner of war, I wrote to her and 

she wrote to me  and we contacted each other. She was here in America. The rest of the 

family disappeared.  
 

Q: Okay. Let's go back then to the period of time before the war. Tell us a little about what 
life was like in the town in which you were born.  
 

A: Podhajce was a small town. It was ma ybe 4,000 Jews and around, around the town were 
Polish people, Ukrainians. There was a difference from the Pollacks. And I went to 

school there, to the public school, for seven years we went. And the town was a very, 

very nice town. It was Podhajce Œ that mean, they had a lot of trees and water and people 

came from all over Poland almost for like a recreation. It was a very nice place. And I 

don't remember poor people there because usually in the towns, in the shtetel you call, 

there was a lot of poor people. I don't remember poor people there. Everybody had some 

kind of store or a business, a small one. My father was a builder. He came  from another 

town and he was building in Podhajce, and he me t my mother. My mother was a farmer's 

daughter, they had land, and he married her and I'm Œ all my life I was till 26 years, the 

war start Œ I was with my mother's family. I hardly knew my father's family. They were

in another town, so it wasn't  so easy to go fr om town to town like it is today. But still 
when I was 14 years old, I went away to Lemberg Œ Lwów, they called it Œ to a bigger 

town, and I went to high school there and I finished school.  
 

01:03:38 

 

Q: And after you finished high school?   

 

A: Oh, I came back. Not directly. I came maybe one or two years later because I had a job in 
Lemberg. I got some Œ I helped out some with teaching little bit, I did odd jobs. And then 

I came back to Podhajce, to my family. And I had a job, was a bookkeeper, I worked in a 

big company from a farmer™s equipment and bicycles, this kind of thing. I was a 

bookkeeper, there. I worked Œ till the war started, I worked there. I had a girlfriend. I 

went out with her for years before the war. And in 19Œ I was a soldier before, too.  
 

Q: Tell us about that. In what way were you a soldier?   

 

A: They took Œ they drafted. After 18 years Œ 19 years, they drafted, and you had to go. And 
I was physically fit and they took me . Usually they didn't took Jews. Very, few Jews they 

took to the army, but I was fitting and I had school, and they took me  to the army. And I 

was one and a half years in Tarnopol in the army and I finished the army I came home 

again and I was working back again in the job. And in ‚39 before the war started, ma ybe 

a month, the town was small and we knew each other. A lot of friends. We  were always 

talking politics on the streets and what will be, what will be, about Hitler came in ‚33 and 

we knew what was going on. The Pollacks were
 already showing their faces too. They 
didn't Œ so much the Pollacks like the Ukraine, there were very few Pollacks there. But 

the Ukrainians there, they showed us that we are Jews, and they are Œ we had fights with 

them. Not big ones, not killings, but fi sts fi ghts and all kind of Œ I remember one Purim 

where we ma de some  kind of a party and a Pollack came and he wanted to disturb this. 

And I had a big fight with him and he almost killed me  because he was very big. I didn't 

give him an inch, I just gave him back. But he never forgot me  this guy. He came  after a 

few days after me . He almost killed me . Around the house he was waiting for me . At 

least, we had our share with this antisemitism. We did not feel so much in with Podhajce, 

like we felt in Lemberg. We felt it more in the bigger towns. They were they called it 

Endeks
1
. There was a group of Pollacks, the right wing and they were completely against 
the Jews and they were even killing before the war break. We had a big 

fight with them on the streets in the gardens and whatever Œ it was a street like in 

Akademicka. That remi nd me  today some body. Jews couldn't walk there. And there was 

the biggest houses belonged to Jews and there was a guy Œ Stricher(ph) was his name  Œ 

he had this biggest house like on Akademicka street. He couldn't even collect the rent 

there. He couldn't go over because the antisemitism was so big and they couldn't Œ they 

were almost sitting in the streets daring,  waiting for Jews to come and to beat them up. 

The situation before the war was already ripe for this, but like a like Œ the churchman said

in Poland, ﬁBoycotting is all right, the Jews. Beating them up, is alright. But not killing. 
Killing is not our aim,ﬂ the Catholic church.  
 

Q: When we get back to the story that you're telling us about your completing the army 
activity, returning to work, the war began, where were you when the war began?  What 

were you doing?   
 

01:07:44 

 

A: That's right. Before the war, they called me over on the reserves. Maybe two or three 
weeks before the war started. They called me  to Nowy Sacz, a town not far from the 

borders of Germany. It is not far from Przemysl and Tarnów. And they Œ I went to the 

army. They, they put us in uniforms and we started to exercise. And ma ybe two weeks 

after, nobody new about this. Nobody Œ the people around there was surrounded there. 

Zakopane was a place where people came there for a cure. And nobody knew that the war 

started and all of a sudden during the night th
ey starting shooting and they left us behind, 
the Germans, and they moved in. It was a Blitzkrieg. They moved in before we even 

knew what happen. We  were in the army. We  were sitting in the mountains because there 

was a lot of mountains, the Carpathian Mountains. And we were sitting there and waiting 

for the Germans and they were around us already, deep in, in Poland and we didn't know 

they were around us. But after a time they started with us too because they did it in 

pockets like, and they start fighting with us and I was wounded in my right arm. I was 

shot and I fell, and but they didn't see me, and I walked over to a house there to a Polish 

woma n and I begged her to let me  in because I was bleeding and she saw me  and she was 

crying. She was afraid, but she took me  in and she start helping me  and she bandaged my 

wound and I was laying Œ when I was laying there for five mi nutes the Germans came in. 

And screaming and looking, and the one with the pistol came over to me and I spoke 

fluently German. I told him, ﬁI'm a soldier and I, I'm wounded.ﬂ He said, "Okay, don't 

worry. We will take you back to the hospital.ﬂ And they gave me something to eat even 

there because they took from the farm woma n and gave it to me  and they brought me  

back to the hospital.  
 

Q: So you were a prisoner of war?   

 

A: And I became a prisoner of war. But I was in the hospital. I didn't feel it so much because 
I was still a prisoner of war, a Polish prisoner of war. Nobody bothered me specially as a 

Jew. Nobody said nothing to me . But the Polish people and the woma n that worked there, 

they knew about it that I am Jewish, but they didn't make a specialŒ      
 

01:10:49 

 

Q: How did they know?   

 

A: Face and the, the ma nners. They knew a Jew. They recognize. Pollacks recognize a Jew 
even we didn't look like one. They knew. And I was lying there ma ybe a month in the 

hospital until I could move my right hand. I couldn't move it, but they helped me out a 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0087 
4 
little bit and I'm, I'm moving it. I still till today is Œ I cannot pick my hand that's all. And 
after a month and a half, they took us, whoever was in the hospital left, and they took us 

to Germany. In a train, they brought me  over to Germany. And they brought me  into 

Stalag 13 Œ in the film you will see, Stalag 13 Œ as a prisoner of war. The second day I 

came in, they put us in a line up, all the Polish prisoners and they asked, ﬁJuden 

raustreten
2
.ﬂ "Jews report.ﬂ I was hesitating for a mi nute, I admit and two friends of 
mi ne, Pollacks, they were standing in my side both of them and they pushed me  out and 

they said, "Here is a Jew.ﬂ  
 

Q: Must have been nice friends.  

 

A: Two friends of mi ne. A day before we, we shared bread because on the way we came, 
they throw bread to us to the, to the train. And I always Œ they always give me  I should 

divide it and I was, I was always a leader between them. And all of a sudden, they 

decided, ﬁhere's a Jew.ﬂ Then I came out. I had no, no choice, and they put a separate 

barracks but to the same  place they kept us. They took us to all kinds of work, heavy 

work during this. We  were cleaning after even Hitler when he spoke in Nuremberg. That 

was Œ I was around NurŠLangwasser, Stalag 13 was there. Nuremberg, we were 

cleaning after Hitler. He spoke once. And I was a little bit more home in the barracks 

because I couldn't work so hard with my hand and they knew about it the Germans. They 

had their report. And in fact, the Red Cross came to us and my number's 30,189. I still 

reme mber. And they have the record of me  when I was born, where I was born, and 

where I fell Œ the 8th of October I think, and when I was in prison.  
 

01:13:34 

 

Q: This is a good chance to go back for a mome nt to think about your family. You have told 
us about the war beginning, your involveme nt in the war. Where was your family?   
 

A: That's a very interesting. My family was on the other side of the border. The Russians 
took over one side of Poland. The Germans took over the other. They had ma de pact, 

Ribbentrop
3
 and Molotov
4
, and they divided Poland. My family was in Galicia, and then 
belonged to Russian and I was on the other side by the Germans and they were by the 

Russians. So 1941 they were under the Russian. It wasn't  too good, but still my father 

was working. He was a builder and he built houses for them, and he built this. And he Œ 

they ma de a living. Nobody killed him there. They knew what is going on the other side, 

because I was corresponding with them. As a prisoner of war, I had the right to write Œ to 

send letters and they were receiving the letters and they were answering me. And one was 

an interesting that I sent a letter that went from one camp to the other when they took me. 

I was in a few camps. But they cut my hair. I had very nice bushy hair and I didn't like it 

that they cut my hair. I looked like a muselman
5
. I looked very bad. Then I wrote to my

parents that they cut my hair again and my sister answers me, "Watch that they shouldn't 
cut your head. The hair will grow back.ﬂ And that was the truth. I had to watch my head.  
 

Q: So during this time while you were prisoner of war, you did keep contact with your 
family?  
 

A: I kept contact with my family and I kept contact even with my sister in America. I was 
sending her letters, and she even sent me a package Œ she was sending me a package. I 

had this sweater Œ I can never forget Œ a green sweater. She sent me and I put it on, and 

when I run away to the, to the woods, I had 
this sweater on. And after a time, there were 
so many insects in this that when I took it over, the sweater walked away by itself. That's 

a joke, that's the truth. That's the way it was. I mean I had contact with my sister and I 

had contact with my family.  
 

01:16:07 

 

Q: Okay. Now, let's get back to where you were. You were taken into Stalag and you were 
given a particular work assignment?   
 

A: I was assigned to the kitchen more or less because in the beginning, they did some other 
works and later on they put me in the kitchen. In the kitchen, I was making coffee and I 

was ma king lunch. And I once I ma de coffee and I didn't know what sugar is. They gave 

me  the salt and sugar was for me  the same . I never saw it before. And you had to Œ sugar 

was in lumps not loose. And I put in ..instead of sugar, I put in salt in the coffee in the 

morning, the group went to work, was Pollacks also, they were eating from this kitchen. 

They wanted to kill me  because the coffee was salted and they figured Œ they called me  in 

the Germans right away and they said it's sabotage and usually when Œ if I would be 

under the SS, I wouldn't live. They would kill me . But this was We hrmacht
6
 there. And 
some of them are still people today you could talk to. And I understand. told him this 

story that I didn't know what it is and I put in salt. And he let me go. But he gave me a 

lesson. I think he took me , he put me  to work, but he was some how lenient to me  because 

I helped him out after a time in his office too. I write German fluently, and I was helping 

in the office to write it. And from Œ this was in Ludwigsburg, I think, yes. I was in 

Nuremberg, and then I was in Ludwigsburg and then I was in what the name?  Münzinger. 

They were taking us from one place to the other. And then Münzinger, all of a sudden 

they decided or it's not Œ they, I mean, the headquarters Œ decided that all Jews have to be 

sent back to Poland. How?  They said they don't want prisoners now. The Pollacks Œ the 

Polish war was finished. Why should they keep prisoners?  ﬁYou are Jews, and no, no 

prisoners and we send you home.ﬂ And they suppose to change, to change us over with 

the Russians. That was in ‚41, and after a time they took us Œ they put us in trains and 

they brought us to Gleiwitz and from Gleiwitz, they brought us to Lublin in a camp 

Lipowa Seven. There was from horses from a camp before. And this Lipowa, right away 

by the train, when they took us over, they showed us, right away, who they are. They

were SS. They came with, with the dogs, peitsches
7
, sticks and all kinds of this, and they 
were beating us right all the way to the camp. And they told, "You are no more prisoners 
of war. You are Jews and we will be treated as Jews.ﬂ But still they kept us separate. 

They didn't put us together with the ghetto. There was a ghetto. In Lublin there was a 

ghetto already then. And they did not put us in the ghetto.  
 

01:19:35 

 
But there was an interesting story. Before I came there was maybe a thousand prisoners. 

They were all Jews also, what came and they Œ the Germans brought them over to the 

Jews from the ghetto and they told them, "You feed them. That's your Jews. You feed 

them.ﬂ And they, they didn't have what to eat themselves in Lublin. The people, the 

population was very bad for the ghetto. And they said, "We don't have food.ﬂ They said, 

"Good.ﬂ They took them out and they killed all the prisoners of war, the whole thousand. 

Maybe Œ ma ybe a tenth was left over by the end. They brought them on the way to 

Lubartów, a small town, and then to Parczew. Maybe there was left ma ybe 10, ma ybe 20. 

I don't Œ I cannot tell exactly and there the people Œ the population, the Jewish population 

put them in right away and gave them food and they kept. I came after this and they felt 

that the Jews Œ they felt they had to do some thing. They ma de a kitchen for us in the 

camp. They brought over and they was cooking for us meals, and they kept us there. The 

leadership there was from the SS. There was Riedel
8
 was the leader, and there was Dolp
9
 
was a small officer. He was the terror of all Lublin and the terror from all over in Poland. 

Dolp was known all over. Dolp came in on a horse to the camp and if he saw some body 

laying in the bed sick or somebody didn't get up so fast in the morning, he shot him right 

on the spot. And we had a lot of problems there in the camp. I was still on the, on the care 

of this hospital whatever because I was shot and I had always showed this paper I had 

from the Germans that I cannot work so hard. Others were working out and in the 

beginning also I went out  to work and we built the known Majdanek camp, Majdanek 

concentration camp. They built fr om the prisoners of war. We built it. And after this was 

ready, we were still there. They brought in the first prisoners of war from Russia. The 

war with Russia started in 1941. I think in July, June. I don't remember exactly the date. 

And when the war started the first prisoners of war in Majdanek were Russians and they 

said Œ the Germans said that they are not Russians Œ just prisoners, but they are 

commi ssars. They are officers some thing like communists real, and they have to die. And 

they were dying like flies. I don't know if they gave them poison or whatever they gave 

them, they were dying. They had typhus there and they were dying. And we got Œ we 

caught from them typhus from the Russians. Me too. I got sick. I got the typhus. And 

they brought Œ they didn't want to give us any care because they were afraid that we will 

Œ they will get sick to the Germans, and they took us out and they put us in a synagogue. 

In the synagogue they put on the floor nothing to cover. Nothing. We  just stayed there. 

We  were about 400 sick people and I think 300 died. And the strongest one, some how Œ I 

cannot believe it, but the stronger ones died. And I had some help from the town

some how. A doctor came in once, and he knew me  from before. And he gave me  a needle 
and he ran out fast because he was afraid that everybody want and he didn't have the help 

for everybody. And he gave me  a needle and some how it helped me , and I lived too.  
 

01:23:31 

 

Q: Mr. Gruber?   

 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: You me ntioned before that you were taken into a synagogue?  Could you describe what 
that synagogue looked like?   
 

A: The synagogue was a very, very big buildi
ng. It was the biggest synagogue in Lublin. 
Lublin was a very known town from Jews. The Jews lived there for hundreds of years, 

historical. The biggest Rabbi for the yeshiva there was in Lublin, and they had the 

biggest synagogue was there in Lublin, too.And they took out everything. It was bare 

walls there, and we were, were laying there 400 people on the floor. Plain on the floor. 

Nobody was taking care of us. Nobody talked to us. Nothing! But the people of Lublin 

once in awhile were daring. They came in and they brought us food a little bit. They 

helped us out a little bit in that synagogue.  
 

Q: These people from Lublin they were in the ghetto?   

 

A: In the ghetto.  

 

Q: And they ma naged to get out of the ghetto?   

 

A: No. No. The synagogue was in the ghetto. This was in the ghetto.  

 

Q: Okay. 

 

A: They didn't have to go out. They came there. They came wome n and the ladies. I had a 
girlfriend there what I knew and she came to help me  out and had friends they came  in to 

me to see me there.  
 

Q: So you were actually able to see what was going on in the ghetto?   

 

A: I was in the ghetto. Lots of times. Because I was working so hard in the outside, then I 
was inside working for self help. People when they went out they were getting some  

foods, some bread. They brought it into the camp and they were bringing it over to me 

and I concentrated and I was going over there. There was a hospital. I would bring over 

food for them. I was given out for people what ever was poor. They couldn't work. I was 

giving out bread. It was self help. I was working with another one. Goldberg(ph) was his 

name . We  both worked in this in the camp.  
 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0087 
8 
Q: How did it come to pass that you were doing these activities?   
 

A: I don't know. I was ma ybe brought up like this from home. I was always in the 
organizations. I was belonged to Shomer ha-Za™ir
10
 when I was a youngster for the Œ for 
the organization for Israel. In fact, before the war I went also to a Hachshara
11
. I was 
preparing to go to Israel and I was maybe a year and a half in that Hachshara working. 

And I was always on the side of the poor. I don't know Œ .somehow I Œ that was my 

nature. And I liked to do it, and I Œ I was helping people.  
 

01:26:31 

 

Q: But you were more than helping?  You were the leader of these activities?   

 

A: I've always Œ some how they Œ they gave me  the leadership. Always as I reme mber there 
was a moment in the camp. There was a lot of doctors, intelligentsia was there. He came 

into the camp already when it was Jew. And one of the doctor, the Germans wanted him 

to be the leader of the camps, he came over to me and he said, "Gruber, you are the man 

for us. We  want Œ I want you to do it.ﬂ I said, "No. Not for the Germans I wouldn't do it.ﬂ 

And I didn't want to take it. Another guy took it. But still they felt something from him 

that I was doing the right thing and they always gave me the leadership.  
 

Q: How did you feel about taking the leadership?   

 

A: I was brought up like that because when I was in the organizations I was always there. I 
was talking to people. I had speeches. But my main subject was antisemitism. I remember 

today that I was always digging in into this, why there is antisemitism all around. Why 

the church?  Why this?  Why they'r e doing this?  And I was always working on this. And 

people were asking me always the questions about this. Why there is antisemitism?  And I 

told once a story and I don't know why it came to me the story. I was reading it or 

something that men Œ a priest asked a man to come into his church. He didn't see him a 

long time in the church. He said, "Why should I go to the church. You always talk 

nonsense? "   He said, "No, no. Come  over. I will have a very nice sermon. Come  over.ﬂ 

The ma n came out. The churchma n talks as a sermon about Jews. He said that the Jews 

killed Christ. The Jews need blood for matzos and all the bad things in the world comes 

from the Jews. He heard a sermon against the Jews. The Pollack walked out and he 

grabbed a Jew on the street. They start beating him up. Then the church man came out, 

the priest came out and said, "Why do you beat this Jew? "  He said, "What do you mean 

why I am beating? "  You just told me  what the Jews did. They killed Christ and, and all 

kinds of things.ﬂ He said, "Wait a second. That was 2000 years ago. That was a long time 

ago.ﬂ He said, "No, " to the priest. "You told it to me  today and while you talking about 

this, we are listening.ﬂ And that's what it was. They were listening to the priest. The 

priest were always talking about this, that Jews are a menace. ﬁThe Jews killed Christ.ﬂ 

But they never told them that Christ was a Jew himself. In Poland if you would tell a

Pollack that Jesus was a Jew, he would kill you it. Because how can it be?  He was God. 
And that came from the churches. It came this hate for the Jews. Next the economic 

situation in Poland was so that Jews were working for the big farmers. Jews were 

working for the kings. Jews were working, collecting taxes. That was their function. And 

by doing this they came in contact with the nation, with the people.  
 

01:30:04 

 

Q: You had a lot of this experience?   

 

A: Experience. Built up in me .  

 

Q: Let's come  back then to where you were when you were put into the synagogue with 
these 400 people, sick people.  
 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: These were all Jews, all workers.  

 

A: Yes. All Jews. Workers.  

 

Q: And this had been me n who had been working on the Majdanek Camp?   

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: Okay. And you were lying there and the doctor gave you an injection?   

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: And then he left?   

 

A: Yes. And the others like I told you, 300 of them died. The rest of them was brought back 
to the camp, to the camp to–. When I came back also, and I was a little Œ felt a little 

better, I still sit down and didn't work. And I had a fr iend of mi ne, his name  was Henryk 

Szengut. He was a very good friend of me , and he was always with me  and he was 

watching me all the time. And after a time was the leader of the camp was a Jewish 

fellow was name d Fiszer
12
. We  had the whole camp. There was 12 camps Œ like 12 
camps Œ like 12, and I was in the sixth.  
 

Q: Okay. Let's think about the camp itself. You say there are 12.  

 

A: Twelve camps and there was barracks.  

 

Q: Could you describe them?  Twelve barracks?

A: Yes, that's what I want to tell. Barracks were there. And in every barrack were ma ybe 
100 Œ 120 Jews there, and every barrack had his own leader there was watching, and he 

was reporting to the main leader, to the Jewish
 official. Official is the leader for the 
camp. And there was two Jews there, Germans, Kapos
13
. They were working for the 
Germans and one was Simon and the other one is Œ I don't reme mber his name . And they 

were German Jews, and they were doing whatever the Germans told them. And the 

Germans Œ they came to us.  
 

Q: And all of the others were Polish Jews?   

 

A: Polish Jews.  

 

Q: And essentially all former prisoners?   

 

A: Essentially former the prisoners, essentially from the side of the Russian side because the 
ones what were on the side where the Germans took over, they let them go home. They 

let them go home and they wind up in ghettos and camps and all this. But the group that 

remained there in this was from the Russian side because they don™t Œ they didn't have 

where to go. We  supposed to be changed for prisoner of wars from Russia to Germany, 

but the war broke out and it stopped it. They were changing some  in the beginning, but 

then it stopped and we were stuck in Lublin in Lipowa Seven. Now, I saw what's going 

on there and Œ      
 

01:32:59 

 

Q: What was going on there that you saw?   

 

A: I mean they were killing people for the Œ for the smallest thing. They were Œ a lot of 
those people went out to work. When they came back, they brought a piece of bread or 

they brought some  shoes some times. Some  a piece of clothing or some thing from the 

Pollacks. They were Œ they were dealing in Œ with them. They give money what they had 

Œ dealing with them. And when they caught them Œ the Germans, they were watching by 

the entrance Œthey caught them, they were hanging, killing. Just for a piece of bread.  
 

Q: Who were they hanging and killing?  

 

A: The prisoners Œ us. The prisoners. When they came from work and they had a piece of 
bread and they found it and they killed you for this. They just Œ they had a hanging place 

and they were hanging. Especially they were killing if some body run away.  
 

Q: What happened if some body run away.

A: If some body run away, they caught him. Usually they caught. They caught two of them 
and they took out the whole camp there one night and they were hanging him publicly 
like everybody should see. They woke us up in the mi ddle of the night and everybody 

came out naked almost and it wasn't  even Œ they told them to take off. Everybody was 

half naked outside and was February, I think Œ the beginning of March cold. Terribly. 

And a lot of us got pneumonia. We  caught cold. And on top of this when they told us to 

go back to the barrack, they was standing in the door and whoever walked in they beat 

them how much they could. Every one of us, we all got beating. I was just behind a ma n 

who start crying, "Don't hit me. I have Œ I have home children, a wife. Don't hit me.ﬂ The 

Germans said, "Yes, I have a child Œ wife and children too, and I have to stay here with 

you and watch you, you stinking Jew.ﬂ And he hit him more even. When he hit him the 

more, I jumped over and he didn't touch me. He came in and I went in first. But my luck 

was that they send me over to work in a special hospital. In a hospital, they had there a 

barrack from the prisoners of war, about 20 of us or 24 Œ I don't reme mber. And we were 

working for the Germans, not SS, for the We hrmacht. And usually every night we went 

to the Œ back to the barracks normal but then they built for us barracks and we was 

sleeping there and getting food there and we were working there. And I worked in a 

magazine.  
 

Q: Go back to a point you ma de. You said, "My luck.ﬂ  

 

A: My luck was I meant the Fisher remember me. He knew that I am Œ that I cannot work 
hard. And he sent me out there, there I was sitting like a offi ce, and I was writing down Œ 

if some body came from the front, Germans came from the front and they needed or they 

have to give back  uniforms, rifles, pi
stols, everything Œ I was registering this. 
Everything! And I had ma ybe 10 of my prisoners of war prisoners. They took it away 

from me  and they were sorting it and keeping it. When the people went back to the front, 

they gave it back. But most of them didn't. And while they had their pistols and rifles, I 

start stealing rifles and pistols there from them.  
 

01:36:45 

 

Q: How is it possible that you were able to steal rifles?   

 

A: I was more or less left alone in the office. I don't know if he had some  kind of 
confidences. German was the head of this. He was like a Volksdeutsche
14
. He spoke 
Polish and he spoke German, and I think he was doing Œ and now as I think, I'm sure he 

was dealing with my people, not with me . Me, he told I should write down that I gave out 

to the Germans more than they took. Let's say I gave them a pair of shoes. I put I gave the 

ma n shoes and pants and a jacket and all this. And he took away the difference what I 

wrote down. I gave out shoes. I put down the shoes, and the difference he took away the 

jacket and the pants and he was dealing with Œ with my people and they were selling 

them to the population somehow. Because being in the hospital the Pollacks had entrance

to us more. We  were not in a ghetto no more. We  had open doors there. We  could go in 
and out. Then they were dealing.  
 

Q: You could go in and out of the hospital?   

 

A: Of the hospital. Yes. We  were watched more or less, but it's Œ it was easier. In fact, every 
day I went back to the camp to collect food for the group because I was like the leader of 

the group there. I remained like a leader. I was, I was going for food. I went to the camp 

with a German with a wagon. He brought me  over there. We  collected food for the 

people. We  didn't need it. In fact, once I gave it away. To the camp I left it. And one of 

the Germans saw it, and he called me over to the head of the camp there, was Mohwinkel  

He said, "What do you mean?  You stealing bread from your comr ades and you give it 

away to the others.ﬂ And he beat me  up over the head with peitsche. This guy Fisher saw 

Œ came just then, and he saw that he is beating me, and he said, "Leave him alone. I will 

take care of it. I will give him a beating. You leave him alone.ﬂ And Fisher just kicked 

me  and threw me  away you know and he said, ﬁJust go back to the camp.ﬂ He did that 

special, you know, to this. And in the camp I had contact with Pollacks. I worked with 

Polish prisoners of war. I worked with the Germans there. I worked with wome n there. It 

was a big hospital there.  
 

Q: What do you mean when you say you worked with these people?   

 

A: Let say, I worked there and they Œ they worked Œ they Œ they and let's say some thing was 
ripped or some thing, they were sewing or they were in the kitchen working. They was an 

admi nistration there from Polish people and the Germans. The Germans were on top and 

the Pollacks were working there. And I was talking to them. We were more fr ee there. 

Inside we were talking. And then came over to me  a ma n. His name  was Paul. Paul. I 

don't remember the second name, and he said to me, "What are you doing here? ," he said, 

ﬁWhy don't you run away? "      
 

01:40:02 

 

Q: What kind of a ma n was this Paul?   

 

A: That's it. I didn't Œ I was afraid of the Pollacks altogether, you know, and especially a 
ma n come s over to me  and tells me  a story I should run away and he knew when I will 

run away that they will kill 20 people. The 
whole group will be killed because for that l 
ma n Œ they told the Germans that. ﬁIf one ma n runs away, we kill 20, we kill 50 whatever 

we feel like we will kill because one man runs away.ﬂ And I told them the story. Said, 

"Listen, they will kill a lot of people if I run away.ﬂ He said, "Try to get out how many 

you can because everyone of you will be killed. 
In the camp, in the ghettos they will kill 
everybody.ﬂ I said, "How do you know it? "  He said, "I am a partisan. I'm a fighter.ﬂ "I 

sit here," he said, "to work, but I have connection with the woods. I know a lot of people 

already out in the woods and they'r e fighting the Germans and I know some  Jews and 

even from your camps, they run away. And I knew that's two or three run away, and they 

are in the woods. They have horses already there. They have rifles.ﬂ He said, "There is a 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0087 
13 
army," he said. I couldn't believe it in the beginning and I decided to stay, but still it was 
very important. And like I told you before, I was a believer. I believed that Hitler will kill 

everybody. I believed. I was reading before the war even what he was doing to people, 

and I believed that he will kill. And I went out. When I came every Saturday or Sunday Œ 

I can't  reme mber when I went for the food Œ I connect myself with the people, the people 

whom I knew and I was talking to them, "People, Let's run away. They will kill us, all of 

us.ﬂ A lot of them were listening to me . And a lot of them said, "Forget it. Who?  The 

Germans? People like the Germans. They are cultural people. The biggest culture in the 

world. They will kill people Œ prisoners of war, especially. Forget it? Anyway, where will 

you go?  In the woods there. The Pollacks are not so keen to see us, and here is at least 

they give us some  food. They gave us some  cover to sleep in the night. We  will live 

through the war like this.ﬂ And I was very sorry for one ma n specially. He was a very 

good friend. He was a lawyer and I was begging 
him, plain begging him, "Come with me . 
Run away.ﬂ He said, ﬁNo, no, no. I can't .ﬂ But I persuaded 22 people and told them that I 

am running away, and I came over to this Pollack and Œ after a few months. It wasn't  

right away. I was finding out if he tells the truth and how he behaves and all this. I was 

watching very carefully. And we ma de a meeting in town. I had a meeting with him and 

two real partisans. People from the woods came over and in a restaurant, a Jewish 

restaurant Œ it was still a Jewish restaurant in the ghetto, and he gave me a compass. He 

gave me  a ma p, and he gave me  directions and where to run and how to run and where to 

meet. And we run away on October the 28th, 1942. We  decided to run away. We  talked 

to these 22 people. Everyone of them knew their locations, where he was to go. In 

separate places there everybody had to go. The going was still good. That means we 

could get out some how. We  could persuade the Germans we have to go out because later 

on I know after this nobody could get out. But it was still a possibility to get out of at 

least to town you know, toŒ     
 

01:44:12 

 

Q: We ll, let's take for example how you got out.  

 

A: That's what I mean. I still Œ I went out. I said, ﬁI'm going to camp for food.ﬂ I told the 
German I am going to the camp. And I was the leader and I had the right to go. I had a 

white band, band there, I was Kolonneführer
15
 and I had the right to go out. And instead 
to go over there to the camp I Œ I started to go in the direction where he told me to the 

woods.  
 

Q: That was walking where?   

 

A: Wa lking through Lublin to the town and on the outskirts of Lublin, and one thing I didn't 
me ntion in my book that I Œ when I walked came in two gendarmes, two police on 

horses, and I saluted them and they didn't say nothing to me and I was shaking like a leaf. 

I was sure this is it. And somehow they let Œ they let me through and I Œ I went through

town and walked straight by myself to the woods where I knew my two people were 
waiting for me .  
 

Q: Okay. Let's slow down again. I'd like to go back for a mi nute to some thing you said 
earlier. You said that while you were in the hospital, you were taking rifles and guns.  
 

A: Right. 

 

Q: Tell me a little bit more about what you were doing with these rifles and guns.  

 

A: Right. We had there a man, today he is in Israel, his name is Weingarten
16
. He had some  
kind of connection outside with Jewish people, with Pollacks. He was selling. I don't 

know really. I was always giving him the rifles . I myself kept one pistol and ammunition. 

I kept myself.  
 

Q: Where did you keep it?   

 

A: I kept it behind my bed. I kept it Œ I didn't keep it a long time, but almost by the end. 
About three, four days before, and Œ      
 

Q: What did you think was happening with all of these rifles?   

 

A: They wind up in the hands of the Polish partisans. They came  there. But I Œ I don't know. 
He told me  he ma de some  money on this too I think through this We ingarten. He gave 

away a few pistols and rifles. But I myself before I went away Œ came to me  Œ I had one 

man, Jegier
17
. He was later the leader and he said to me, "We wanted to buy by the 
Pollacks some  rifles and ammunition to buy and we had money for this.ﬂ And the last 

mi nute they refused and we don't have. Not one
 rifle, not one pistol, nothing. And they 
took our money too. And he said, this Jegier said, "What shall we do now?  I don't think I 

will run away now. Without nothing, what will 
we do now in the woods without.ﬂ I said, 
"Jegier, you do whatever what you want. I am going. I decided and you please tell your 

people they should go because I am going.ﬂ And some how Jegier and 22 of them, they all 

came on time. Six o'clock, like a clock or was it seven o'clock because it was darkness 

already on October the 28th, and we met all of us we met by the two Pollacks and there 

start a new other odyssey, started new chapter in my life.  
 

01:47:57 

 

Q: Okay. Let's take a mi nute before we go onto the new chapter to think about another 
aspect of your life in the camp for you. You were ma intaining your contact with your 

family all through this time?   
 

A: Right.

Q: Right up to that point?   

 

A: Right. 

 

Q: How Œ did you have any thoughts about where 
you're going to be a, a year from then, a 
month from then?  Did you have any thoughts about your future?   
 

A: Who could think about a future there?  You lived day by day. We  saw what is going on, 
and every one of us was feeling that after tomorrow he will not be there. Nobody could 

think. But I remember one thing what I did. It was not legal. I sent a letter through a girl 

there. All the mail what we sent home or wherever went through a censor and my letter I 

gave to a Polish girl and she took it with her, and somehow, they caught the Polish girl 

with my letter. In this letter Œ I remember like today Œ I said, "I'm running away,ﬂ and I 

told my family, "Run away. Nobody will liv
e. Run, because the Germans will kill 
everybody.ﬂ And the Germans caught this letter and I'm lucky, lucky it was a 

We hrmacht, not SS, and this guy beat me  up and beat up this girl and didn't gave the 

letter to the SS. Otherwise I wouldn't live  till then to run away. This was Œ that Œ and 

that's the circumstances we were living. Day by day we didn't know if today is one killed 

or another. But it was an interesting story there. When we were building the Majdanek, 

that this Dolp. I said, in the beginning, the officer, he was supervising the work there, and 

one of our Jewish boys Œ .he was from Tarnopol, I don't reme mber his name , and he 

didn't like his work. The Œ Dolp didn't like how he worked and they started beating him 

up. This Jewish boy threw hims elf on this Dolp 
and start fighting with him, fist fighting. 
He fought with him, but he had a pistol or some thing and he hit him, the Jewish boy. And 

he started bleeding and they took him, and interesting, they didn't kill him. They took him 

away to a hospital, and they kept him there. The Germans kept him there for a long time 

until he healed. When he was healed, they took him out and Dolp said, "He's mi ne.ﬂ He 

told him, "Run away now in the field.ﬂ He told him, "Run.ﬂ He ran and, and he killed 

him. That was this, but he was a hero this guy. He fought with him. In the beginning, he 

was really fighting. I don't remember his name. I'm sorry I don't.  
 

Q: It's not usual for prisoners Œ      

 

A: It was impossible. Not prisoners Œ nobody, nobody dared to, to fight with the German 
because they were killing. Right away, before you even start Œ before Œ but some how he 

was fighting him. He didn't kill him right away. But then he hit him. He didn't shoot him. 

He hit him hard. That was interesting. But then he shot him when he told him to run 

away.  
 

01:51:37 

 

Q: You me ntioned partisans before. How did you learn about partisan activities?   

 

A: Partisan activities I told you this man Œ this Pole told me what is going on. They'r e 
running away. Pollacks and Jews are running away and they form an army. I didn't know. 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0087 
16 
In, in my mi nd, it was a army again because I was in the army before I was in Hachshara. 
I was always like in a scout and this was in my mi nd, it will be like the army. It is not a 

partisans, I have no idea what it is. And when we came these two guys start leading us, 

starting showing us what to do, how to do. And the first thing we went through a water. 

We  had to _______, a small river and we had to take off the shoes and they showed us 

how to cross and by one by one we crossed the water and we came on the other side. And 

then they brought us over to a place in the woods, deep in the woods and he said Œ there 

was not far a river Œ and he said, "Here we will make a camp. In the night Œ we will go 

every night,ﬂ we were 22 people, ﬁOn Œ 11 under your leadership and the other 11 going 

with–,ﬂ Kaganowicz was the other guy Œ he was a leader too. ﬁWe will go Œ 11 people 

we will go into the farmers in the night.ﬂ I had the map,  I had the compass and every 

night we went to another village there around the woods. Not far. And we walked in, and 

the Pollack went with us, one of them and one went with the other. And they knocked on 

the window in the night and they said, "We are fighters for Poland," into the windows 

because people were scared. They woke up in the mi ddle of the night and there's people 

with Œ with rifles or whatever. Nobody ha
d a rifle. Nobody nothing. You know what we 
did. We  took some  wood and we put it on, on a string and I had a pistol. And I speak very 

good Polish and I was always the speaker for them and I came over and I said Œ because 

most of our Jews, they didn't speak a good Polish. They spoke Yiddish most of them and 

half Russian because their guys were the other side, but I spoke Polish, I went to school. 

And I came over and I said, "I'm fighting for Poland for, for your freedom. We  don't want 

nothing from you. Just give us some  food and we will go away. Some  milk, bread.ﬂ We  

were always taking some  bread for the people for another 11 people back. And that was 

happening every night we were going to another village and until we exhausted already 

around this, we said, "Let's go some where else.ﬂ And we start moving. And then Pollacks 

then too said, "Listen, you cannot walk around like this, rifles without on you. They will 

kill us. Any day the Œ the farmers will tell the Nazis or somebody and they will kill us 

all.ﬂ "Give us Œ you have some  money. You have some  money or some thing?  Give it to 

me  and we will go out back to Lublin and we will buy some rifles or get some  pistols or 

whatever.ﬂ And they walked Œ they took everything what we had and they walked away 

from us. And I don't see them till today. I don't know what really happened. If they were 

caught or some thing like that, but we never heard from them. And then we were on our 

own. And then we start moving.  
 

01:55:29 

 

Q: Okay, before we start moving on again, we'r e going to take a mi nute now and relax and 
change the tape and start up again. So you've done beautifully.  
 

A: Okay. 

 

Q: Thank you.

01:59:53     

 

Q: Okay, Mr. Gruber, you brought us to the poi nt where there were 22 of you, who had gone 
into the forest with the two Polish partisans. You told us that the partisans then took your 

money, your belongings, left, went back into the city and Œ never to be seen again. This 

left you with 21 other me n. Could you tell us about what your thoughts were when you 

saw yourself there with 22 Œ 21 other me n, facing an unknown situation?   
 

A: It was a very, very hard situation, we Œ also
 we were already on the last few days in the 
woods. But still we relied more or less on the Polish two guys, when they came over to 

the farmers, they helped with this. Because the farmers, we knew, didn™t like Jews 

specifically. That™s why I changed my name to Mietek, this is a real Polish Œ Mieczyslaw 

and short is Mietek. And almost every one of our group took a Polish name , that they 

shouldn™t Œ also we talked Yiddish between
 ourself and we, we were a Jewish group, 
almost everybody knew, but we didn™t want to be so obvious in dealings with the farmers 

to say that Jews. And they always had that imagination that a Jews is not a soldier, a Jew 

doesn™t know what a rifle is, a Jew doesn™t Œ he™s different than all of them. The 

difference what meant a lot, that they, they Œ some of them they didn™t see a Jew, but they 

told them the story about this. Then, this remi nds me  when I was in Germany. One day 

they took me to a farmer to work in the farm and when they came time to lunch they took 

me home and I was sitting by the table and there was a young girl, a German girl. And I 

was talking fluently German, I spoke to her, and she spoke to me , and I saw she likes me , 

she™s talks to me. Then she starts talking about Jews, ﬁBecause of the Jews the war broke 

out. Because of the Jews the Œ this, this, this.ﬂ I asked her a plain question, ﬁDid you ever 

saw a Jew? ﬂ She said, ﬁNo, I never saw.ﬂ I said, ﬁHow you know what it is? ﬂ  She said 

ﬁHitler said that they are killer, that they ar
e this, this, this. And they have horns,ﬂ she 
said, ﬁthey have horns. Jews have horns.ﬂ I said, ﬁListen darling, I am a Jews and I have 

no horns.ﬂ She almost died. I couldn't believe it, what kind of faces she ma de then and 

she Œ she ran out from the house and she was so excited and so this Œ and she came back 

and said, "You are lying to me. That's impossible," she said. ﬁYou couldn't be it.ﬂ I was a 

good looking young fellow in a uniform and she couldn't believe it. And that was the, the 

image of the Jews. It was only Œ they didn't know even, who a Jew is. But the image of a 

Jew was, for them, some thing that Œ terrific, was with horns or some  devil or some thing a 

Jew is not a norma l person. That is what they Œ      
 

02:03:54 

 

Q: That's a interesting story. We will get to that later.  

 

A: That's why I came to the farmers when we came. The Pollacks helped us out and they, 
they were the front, and now we had to be the front and I was the front always because I 

spoke very good Polish and I always came in and like I told before, I was introducing 

myself and I told them why I was here. Then, when we exhausted the neighborhood, we 

started moving away from there. But before we moved, we had a problem. We  had a boy 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0087 
19 
with us from Majdanek, and this boy run away from Majdanek in a special way. He 
jumped in Œ they took out the, the Œ I don't know how to tell it in English, from the, from 

the horses, the, theŒ     
 

Q: Manure. 

 

A: Manure. And he jumped in into this. And the farmer didn't see him and he was almost 
choked to death there but he Œ he came out from there with a horse manure from 

Majdanek. It was almost impossible to get out from that. He came out from there. And 

some how the Pollacks from the Underground, they brought him over to me . And he got 

typhus. He became sick in the woods. We  put him in, in our Œ in a hole some where. They 

covered him up because it was cold already in October. And we kept him like this and 

from himself, he got better and we were waiting for him to get better. In meantime, we 

were 22 people, and three of our people said, "That's enough.ﬂ They don't want to go run 

like this. ﬁIt is no use. They will kill all of us, and it's very hard life. I'd rather go in a 

camp where I have a soup and they gave me  some  work to do. The Germans will not 

kill.ﬂ And three of our people went back to the camp. 
 

02:05:56 

 

Q: How do you feel about their leaving?   

 

A: It was a terrible shock to me. I couldn't believe it because we went through so much by 
running away, and they jeopardized other people and all this, and they, they knew about 

this, but you can't  judge people. You don't know. Everybody has his own mi nd, and it 

was very hard. The beginning was so hard it's unbelievable. I was really scared. I didn't 

know where I am. When I came in, I saw the woods. It, it was a special wind blowing 

from the woods with a noise, the Pollack said, "Here, this will be your home now.ﬂ To 

walk in into this, and it was dark when we walked in into the woods and in the woods, it 

was Œ the animals were ma king a lot of noise and it Œ and I came from a, from a town, 

nothing Œ a village and it was scary. And one of them trees was something broken. It 

made so much noise that we didn't know that it was a wounded animal or something like 

that or a human being or some thing and one of our people jumped up to the tree and he 

cut it off and he showed that was only a tree ma king the noise. But we were really scared. 

We  didn't know what, what to expect there. You don't know where you are. In fact, we 

really didn't know where we were because not far from us ma ybe a mile or two, were 

Germans living. There they had a garrison. They  lived there, and they were watching 

their mill. There was there a big one. But we didn't know. We  didn't know for nothing. 

We  were just came in there and, and we were doing our job, going every night and back 

and forth. And it's good that we decided to go away because the farmers start talking and 

the Germans would fi nd out fa st, and they would kill us.  
 

02:08:03 

 
Then we went away and after a night, or two nightsŒ I don't reme mber exactly how it was 

Œ by walking from one place to the other, only by ma p. Only by a compass and a ma p. 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0087 
20 
We  didn't ask nobody. In the night all of a sudden we hear noises in the woods and we 
stopped, and start looking, what kind of noises, voices. We heard something like Yiddish, 

spoken and I said, "This is some thing.ﬂ And we over near one or two of us, the rest was 

standing on the side, and we start screaming, "amkha
18
." Means ﬁyour people.ﬂ And right 
away from the other side answered voice, "amkha.ﬂ And to our amazing we found a 

whole group of people who had run away from a village. This was ma ybe Œ they called a 

town Markuszow, what they called it, a village Markuszow. The whole town of there was 

ma ybe 100 people or whatever run away from this camp. And they all came to the woods. 

And there were ladies and me n and children, a camp. And between them were two 

Russian prisoners of war who had run away also from a camp, from a prisoners of war 

camp. They run away from a Russian camp. They run away. One was Kolka Œ one was 

Mikoi Œ  Tolka, Tolka, and Mikoi, was the two me n there. One was a officer and the 

other was a sergeant or some thing from the Russian army. And when they saw usŒ we 

came in uniforms, we were all in uniforms from the prisoner of war Œ oh, he got so 

excited and he Œ they took us over and he start talking and we looked around and we saw 

they were building bunkers. You know what a bunker is?  They were building in the land 

Œ they were building some  hiding places there, and they put up trees or grass. They 

covered everything and they were living down in this hiding place.  
 

02:10:18 

 

Q: Why don't you take a mi nute and tell us about what these bunkers really did look like?   

 

A: They are bunker, bunker was interesting this. I, I can't  shake it from me because I hated 
the bunkers, as to me it looked like a grave. You go in a graveyard right there, cause they 

had a door in the front where you walked in from the side,  and the top it was like grass. 

You didn't see nothing on top. It was woods there around and trees and everything and 

dug. They dig into the, into the earth.  
 

Q: How far down did they go?   

 

A: Far. There was for a 20 people here. And one, one bunker was for 40 people. Far,  big 
and it was two entrances. One for them to walk in and one to walk out. Far away to walk 

out. Took a long, long time and when they built, they built it open you know. Then they 

take woods. They put on top and they covered it. And when it was raining, rain came in Œ 

still not all the way, but it came in still someway. When I saw this, I said, "No, not for 

me. I didn't come in here to, to, to lay in Œ then the Germans will come in, and it's very 

easy to get all of us.ﬂ And I said, "No. I will not stay here.ﬂ And I told this Tolka and 

said, "It's not for me .ﬂ He said, "If you want to
 stay.ﬂ He said, "I have children and I have 
women. I have people. Where will Œ what will I do with them?"  They have to be placed 

some where and hidden. They said, "Okay, we will be around you and we will work with 

you.ﬂ But then he says, "Please, give me somebody what is a soldier and discipline he 

knows because all of them come  from towns and they'r e children and they don't know 

what army is, what soldiers is, what it is. Give me  a few people of yours.ﬂ And they will

teach, start learning them the skill of the army. And I said, "Okay.ﬂ And I left  Jegier, 
Cygan, I remember the name, and the woman Gottlieb(ph) her name, three or four I left  

with Tolka. And they were, they were starting working with him. I went away. But we 

kept contact all the time. We Œ through other farmers Œ how it happened, Tolka had 

already connections. 
 

02:12:57 

 
He came to a town, Garbów and in this town was a ma n. His name  was Kami nski, Genek 

Kami nski. This was a known and this Genek was some thing what we have to thank a lot. 

He was Œ I think he was a communist before he war or at least a socialist, I don't know 

what Œ and he belonged to a group of people and he had some  people there working 

against the Germans. And this Tolka brought me over to him. He introduced me to him. 

And we start working from this, this was our like  headquarters. This Tolka had 

connections with the real partisans Œ not partisans special, but with the heads of the 

partisans. He had connections with the A.L.
19
. This was army in Armi a Ludowa. There 
was a Gomulka
20
 and there was a Moczar
21
, and there was Zymi erski
22
 and there were all 
the heads of Poland which were later on the Polish governme nt, and he had some  

connections with these people. And little by little he almost gave his orders, instead of 

them, too. But we lost Œ we became appointed with Genek. In the nights we came to him, 

and he was taking care of us now. He was sending us out for special work. He told us 

which farmers have rifles or ammunition or something and he said, "Go to this farmer 

and tell him he should give you a rifle. If he doesn't , you do whatever you feel like 

because he has it.ﬂ And we did. And with the help Œ      
 

02:15:00 

 

Q: When you say, you did Œ could you describe one such action?   

 

A: We  came, we came Œ first of all, we needed always help now from this Markuszow 
people. We  were in touch with them. They had Jegier with them and he was teaching. 

And we were taking out some  of them people like Sever Rubinstein and others, and they 

were going with us also. First of all, they knew the terrain. They know where to go. And 

we were strangers. We  were not from this neighborhood, and this was very, very 

important. They knew every piece, every house, every farmer, every Œ they, they knew 

everything around there, and it was very, very helpful for us. Especially was one of them 

guys a young fellow was Franek Bleichma n. He came from another town. We  me t also. 

He wasn't  from this town fromŒ what's  name  Œ Markuszow. He was from Kami onka, a 

small town. And he came out with a small group of his people, of Jewish peopleŒ young, 

youngsters. He was ma ybe 18, 19 years. He wasn't  a army ma n too, but he was very 

shrewd and he was Œ he knew the neighborhood. His father, I think, was dealing with 

farmers or some thing and he was taking him with him, and he knew around the

neighborhood. And this Bleichma n became very handy to us and he was always helping 
us, going when we needed in the night for a Œ certain things. Because this Tolka  Œ no, 

Genek Kami nski, he gave us orders now already. He told us, "Go in this and this place 

and there is  Œ  a train going through.ﬂ And we took axes and very primitive things, 

shovels and all this, and take away a piece of rail, of rail. A train will come . It will fell off 

from this. And the first action was Œ the train was right in the beginning. And we came 

off Œ I reme mber I had a very strong ma n. Zelazny
23
 was his name, zelazny
24
 means iron. 
And we called him ﬁZelazny,ﬂ because he was 
so strong, and he, he ripped out with those 

Œ almost with his hand, he ripped out a piece of the rail and but we still Œ he ripped it out 

but it was staying still. He didn't Œ he didn't take it away. And with axes, we were 

working there for hours until we heard a train comi ng. A train comi ng, and we stay away 

and the train stopped. It stopped there because when the train saw that something was 

mi ssing or something later, the train stopped. But it disrupt already maybe a whole night 

and a whole day the communication because they, they were dragging who knows what Œ 

some  ammunition to the front. It was on the way from Lublin to Wa rsaw. This, this was 

the spot. And we disrupted already this. Its Œ but we couldn't stay there too long, because 

we were afraid and we came back and we told this Tolka, reported to him that we did this 

and this. He was very happy, and this gave us some  kind of a lift. ﬁOh, we can do 

things!ﬂ   
 

02:18:32 

 
Then he sent us out on the highways. We  put up a me tal string to the highways. When a 

car came, it had to stop. We stopped them and we were on the sides waiting for them. We 

had a few rifles already from the farmers wh
at we took. But interesting was this. One of 

our ma n Œ his name  was Finkel
25
 Œ went back to the camp where I was working and there 
was another hospital too, and there were rifles and there were pistols and they were Œ 

what's the name  Œ other things, what do you need?  Coats, because when I ran out I 

couldn't take nothing with me . It was still warm. Nobody has a Œ nobody had a coat with 

him. It was cold. It start to be cold, so we
 were shivering cold. And we sent out this 
Finkel. He did Œ didn't look like a Jew completely. He was looking like a Pollack. And he 

went back to the camp and he organized there another 20 people. But this time they took 

a German and they told him Œ they were dealing with him, like I told you, the Jews were 

help Œ dealing with them Germans there. They told him, "You see and look. Don't say 

nothing.ﬂ And they put on the rifles and uniforms and what's the name  Œ covers and bed 

spreads and all kinds of things, a full truck, and he was dealing with them before Œ 

robbing them to sell things, but he didn't know what is going on and we had Œ Finkel 

knew where we will be there in the woods. He ma de a an appointme nt with him, and he 

brought over the whole truck with ma ybe about 20 rifles. New ones, German ones. 

Completely new ones! And he brought it over to us on the spot. The German, that was 

one of the guy who was the leader from the Dworecki was his name . He said to the 

German, "You go back and shut up. Don't say one word, you know us. You saw nothing,

because they will kill you, or we will kill you. Then just don't say nothing.ﬂ "No, I will 
not say nothing," and let him go.  
 

02:20:54 

 

Q: That's an incredible story. How, in fact, did Finkel arrange toŒ  

 

A: Finkel went back too, because he knew the place. He was living there before, and he 
knew how to get in. And he walked into the people there in the hospital there and he 

contacted himself with this group, and the people Dworecki was there like a Mikoi the 

whole group, about 20 people. And he talked to them. He was there two, three days. We  

knew what is it Œ we will be like this two, three days and we had a appointme nt with him 

to come  back on this and this spot. And he Œ they knew Œ he knew that they are dealing 

with this German too. He knew always, of course, because he was dealing with this 

German, too. And they took out whatever they wanted.  
 

Q: But to deal, you needed money?   

 

A: No. You needed money if you would buy it, but they didn't. They told them Œ they took 
out a pistol from the Œ and they said to this German, "You go back. No money for you. 

You just thank God for your life and get back and don't say nothing to nobody.ﬂ And he 

went back and we had the rifles. I received Œ I remember a German coat I put on and a 

hat Œ the German I put on.  
 

Q: How did you feel?   

 

A: And I felt, I felt in two ways. First of all, I got warmer because it was very, very cold, but 
I felt very bad that I have to wear a uniform from a German. That was always 

inconceivable. This was some thing what Œ goodness! But we felt proud for the whole 

situation what we did because this was nobody could accomplish a thing like this. This 

was a big accomplishment to bring 20 rifles, new ones, on the spot.  
 

02:22:46 

 

Q: Now, you had a small army.  

 

A: We had a small army. We had already this and we told this Tolka all of them. We told 
them what we have now and what is. Everybody was happy. We  start doing real work. 

We  start going out for the Germans on the highways. Then we start the towns. Every 

town had a town house, and in this town house they were registering everybody and 

when you were registering the people, the Germans were using it. One second, I have to 

drink. The Germans registered almost every young Pollack. They registered even the 

Jews, whatever the registration in the Œ in the town house. We got our order to recover 

this, to fight and to burn it out, ruin it that they shouldn't have the registrations from the 

people there because they took it away to Germany. They took it away to work. They 

have a register. They came up home, and they took up the kids and we start burning up 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0087 
24 
the towns. Every town house there, and Markuszow was the first we knew where to go. 
We  always used the people what were from there from this town, say from Markuszow 

say from ﬂ               Ł and other towns where they have Œ we had the people what run 

away fr om them villages. And they were together with us then.  
 

Q: But now, how was it possible for you and your small army to burn down a building. 

 

A: It was, it was very easy. We  took some  straw and we threw in straw and ma de a fire.  

 

Q: Nobody saw you enter?   

 

A: They saw, and they didn't say. Some  people Œ the Pollacks they saw, they were afraid of 
us because we came with rifles and then they Œ it was night. Always in the night we were 

doing it. And we were burning. It was very, very easy for us. We  would Œ except once we 

had in Markuszow we had some  going over. The Germans were there, and Œ but before, 

before we came in the Germans were there. And by accident, they saw our people and we 

had to fight with them. And we still burned down. It was a whole story. Is a very long 

story. And we still burned down the village. But we had losses there. One was killed, and 

one was Zelazny the strongest guy what we had had still today, still today had a piece of 

iron from the bullet was in him, staying there. Didn't come out.  
 

02:25:41 

 

Q: During this action as you described, what was your responsibility?   

 

A: I was the leader. As I was going with them, people, first of all, this not like in other 
armi es. A partisan, the leader had to go front. That was our Œ I don't know why, but we 

took over the Œ a leader was in the front, and the soldiers were behind. Here I think is the 

other way around. I remember in the army it was the other, other way. The officer was in 

the back and the soldiers were going in the front. I remember in the war, the old officers 

were in the back and the soldiers were in the front. Then here we changed it. I was 

always in the lead. I had to go in the front. Wherever you went, I had always with me let's 

say a Bleichma n or another one, what knew the terrain and I was in the front, going and 

they were after me . That's what we was scared stiff. Every night when you go, you don't 

know what will happen. Who will shoot or who will do some thing to you,  you 

understand?  You didn't know if you will meet Pollacks what are against you Œ I'm sorry. 

One second. I don't know what happen. All of a sudden, some  food or whatever. But you 

had to do it. You cannot tell the people that you are afraid. You had to go. You had to 

lead. And it was like a army. We  got orders, you know, to burn down this and this 

village. And we did it. Next, we had this gr
oup of our people went out for food one night, 
a separate group, small, and on the way back some  Polish people called over two of them 

what they knew them by name. Morel, and the other one I don't remember. Morel and the 

Pollacks, young boys from the same  town where this Jew was, called him over, said, 

ﬁMorel, come over here.ﬂ And he had a machine gun this guy and they called him over. It 

didn't took long and they killed them, both of them. The Pollacks. And the rest of this 

group, was ma ybe four or five came running to us in the mi ddle of the night. Running, 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0087 
25 
and they left everything because they had some  food some thing, and they left everything 
and said, "You know, they killed Morel, and the killed the other one. Two guys.ﬂ We  

ma de a meeting from a few people there and we could talk to this Genek Kami nski came  

over to him because we wanted to find out exactly who did it because we didn't know 

who killed him. We  knew the village where it happened. Then after meeting is an end, we 

decided to burn down the, the whole village. And we burned down the whole village. 

Came over at night fr om one corner to the other. But one thing we didn't, we didn't kill 

the people. We  told them to run out before we went from one place to the other. We  had 

straw and as we had other, I think gasoline a little, I think, we took, too,  petroleum or 

something we had. We pour a little bit  match and burned the whole village. It was a very 

Œ one of the, one of the richest villages there around.  
 

02:29:29 

 

Q: How did that ma ke you feel?   

 

A: This was Œ it didn't feel good altogether because we had to live with them Pollacks. We 
didn't come to fight with the Pollacks, and we left them and I remember I wrote myself a 

piece of paper in Polish. I was Œ by the way, I was writing almost everything what I went 

through by the day. I had a paper, a book with me, paper and a pencil and I was writing 

down almost everything what happened. But I will tell you later what happened to it. And 

I wrote them a leaflet like that said, "You see what you're doing. You kill our people. We 

have to kill you. We  didn't come  to fight with you. We  want to fight the Germans, and I 

think you supposed to help us and not going against us and on top of this to kill our 

people.ﬂ I left notes and left this. Then we had a case like this. We were in a farm house. 

And a Polish ma n there which lived there went to the Germans, and he told them. The 

Germans came and some how we, we were always soldiers. That's what's good for us 

because we were watching. We  had a watch out
side, a watch inside. If we were sleeping, 
was still was a watch. One or two was watching. I was on the watch there outside and I 

see a lineup of Germans comi ng. It was on a hill. We  were in a house and downstairs, 

down below the Germans are comi ng. I woke up everyone of us, put on Œ we had to Œ we 

start running out from the house because when they came to a house near that's it. 

Nobody could get out because they threw like we did. Straw or some thing and they start 

shooting with fire, ammunition, and they burned down the houses and they burned down 

the people there. We  ran out and we run away a whole day, we had to fight with the 

Germans. We  ran, shoot back, run and shoot back. No one of our people was killed there 

in this skirmi sh. In the night, the Germans disappeared. They left us alone. We went back 

to this village, and we went to the house where this happened where we left, left the 

house and we said, "What's going on? "  The ma n wasn't  there already and the son wasn't  

there and we start asking people. They said, "The son went to the Germans and he told 

them that we are there.ﬂ So, "Good. We  will stay there and watching.ﬂ And all of a 

sudden I see there a young, a youngster walks and I called him over, say, "Who are you? "  

He said, "Oh, I didn't want to. I Œ They Œ My father told me  to go.ﬂ It was the guy what 

we slept there, and he said his father told him to go to report to the Germans, you know, 

this. "I will work with you. I will be with you and please don't kill me. Don't.ﬂ We took 

him away. We really didn't want to kill him. Just want to beat him there, you know, a 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0087 
26 
good beating, but I saw him. Of course, a ma n like this if he goes report the Germans, 
he's a spy already against us. This is nothing. Then we took him out in the outskirts and 

start beating him up. He was screaming there. Then one of our people saw that he 

screams too loud, took out the rifle and they killed him. I was sorry that they killed him, 

but still it was comi ng to him. When he killed him Œ he shot him it made a noise. The 

shot and the Germans were not far, and they start shooting at us and they started, but it 

was night and we just got away. The next day they buried this boy, the Pollacks or two 

days in the churchman. What is the name?  The Pope. What is the name?   
 

02:33:45 

 

Q: Priest. 

 

A: The priest said to the congregation, ﬁListen, people, you see what's going on. When a 
group of people come  in–ﬂ  
 

Q: It's okay. Take your time.  

 

A: This will come out there too.  

 

Q: Why don't you pick it up then when you were talking about how the priest.  

 

A: Yes, exactly. That's what I'm going to bring out, because it was very important. And the 
priest came over and said, "Listen people. You see what's going on. We have the 

Germans on one side. We have the partisans on the other side Œ the Jews, the Pollacks or 

whatever it is. The Jew Œ the Germans are our Œ is our enemy number one. This group is 

comi ng to you. They want some  food in the night and they'r e going away. They don't stay 

with you. Don't report them. Don't tell nothing because you will be squeezed in both 

sides. They will kill you. See here is a boy killed for nothing,ﬂ he said, ﬁbecause he, he 

went to the Germans and he told.ﬂ He said, "Don't do it any more.ﬂ The priest said that. 

This helped a lot. Like I say, the priest Œ      
 

Q: How did you know that the priest gave this sermon?   

 

A: Oh, the Pollack, they told me. The farmer's group. When I went to the farmers, I came in. 
I was home because I repeat the places. When I went over to a farmer and he was nice to 

us. You know, the farmer. Because some  of them, they were not too nice. They just gave 

us what we wanted and get out. Some  of them were really nice. They kept us. They told 

us to stay with them. Then we came to them back, and they told us what is going on. 

They told me the priests spoke like this, and the priest told them and knew he told them 

also. He said, "Why do you have to go to call the Germans?  The Germans are far away. 

They don't know what is going Œ comi ng in the, in the woods. If you told them, they 

know.ﬂ And this ma de a big difference. 
Big, because people stop, stopped bothering us. 
They stopped, except they let us go. We  came in. We  did our work. We  did never, never 

abuse them people because there were groups like robbers or something people came in 

they run away. They were on the German's hands or whatever, and they formed also, not 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0087 
27 
partisans groups Œ bandits from this, and they came in usually and they took away 
whatever the farmer had. But we came in like gentleme n you know. We came  in with a 

speech. I said Œ I told them, ﬁWe're fighting for freedom. We  don't want nothing from 

you. We  just want to eat some thing and we want to relax or to sleep a few hours.ﬂ And 

this one farmer told the other, and they knew what's going on. Now Œ      
 

Q: We re your Œ did your group have it's own identify?   

 

A: ﬁThe Mietek,ﬂ ﬁthe Mietek Grupa
26
,ﬂ ﬁGroup of Mietek,ﬂ ﬁthe Group of Mietek.ﬂ The 
group Œ lots of things later on:  ﬁThe Group of Jegier,ﬂ name s the people knew.  
 

Q: This was your group.  

 

A: My group, ﬁMietek.ﬂ Everybody knew about it and they knew Œ the farmers knew about 
me , and they knew about this recomme nd. In fact, there was a, a landowner, very rich 

one, and he always gave us money when we came. And he gave us a cow or whatever, 

whatever we wanted. Horses we needed to go 
from one place to another. He always gave 
us. Then he gave it when I was there. If the group came in without me, he wouldn't give. 

He wouldn't give. Nothing.  
 

Q: Why was that?   

 

A: I don't know. He had a mi nd some thing, and I think he was right after this. After the war, 
this landowner was arrested for helping the Germans like because he had Germans there 

also in the landowners house. And he called me as a witness that I should tell the court 

how he helped, how he gave money you know. And he said, said ﬁI didn't gave no money 

to nobody, only you. You should be the witness. You should know about it.ﬂ And he used 

it after the war. He gave money only to me . We  used the money for all kinds of things we 

gave the farmers. 
 

02:38:19 

 

Q: How, how much time had you spent in the woods with your group of me n before you 
reached the point where you were confident about your leadership?   
 

A: It took time to be 100 percent confident in this. It was very, very hard. I will tell you 
straight. With Jewish people, it is very, very 
hard to be a leader. Every one of our Jewish 
people were a leader himself. They knew a lot you know. They are not dummi es. 

Everyone of them, and to be a leader by Jews, you really have to have guts and you have 

to have patience and you have to have Œ I don't know what Œ to be a leader, but this is no 

jokes. This is I tell you at this Œ what's the Ben-Gurion
27
 said it was, ﬁI am a president of 
million presidents.ﬂ And that was very, very hard for Jewish people this. But there was a 

necessity. I have the upper hand because I spoke fluent Polish. When I came to a farm or

 Group (Yiddish)

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0087

some thing I had Œ I had to speak because most of them spoke Yiddish and the language 
was difficult. Only Szengut was the guy whatŒ but he looked so Jewish and so Yiddish 

he couldn't, he couldn't represent us you know. It was Œ we had to push him a little bit on 

the side. Now, we established our presence in the neighborhood, but we felt we couldn't 

stay too long in the neighborhood. They told us not to stay, and we didn't. We  felt Œ 

because we exhausted Œ I came twice Œ three times to the same farmer. He didn't have 

what to eat himself to watch this, and we had to go farther. Then I decided to go with the 

group of 10 people to find out Œ because they were talking about other groups on the 

other side of the Bug. We  were Œ there was Œ when you see the ma p, there was a, a Œ this 

river, Wi eprz, is the name  Œ Wi eprz and the next was the Bug. The Bug was the border 

from Poland and Russia already later. But we were  between the Wi eprz and the Bug 

later. In the beginning, we were on the other side of the Wi eprz. We  had to cross. And we 

crossed over the Wi eprz and we knew that between the Wi eprz and Bug is a group Œ is 

groups, partisans there that we heard about. You know they told us, the farmers. There 

was no telephones, but we heard that.  
 

02:41:10 

 
We had connections all the time. This Genek, his connections was saving us always. We 

knew when the Germans going out from Lublin with a expedition of some thing, we knew 

about it. They told us. The farmers, one told the other and they told us. We had the 

connections. We  had this. And only with connections we could live through. We  were 

laughing already there when I was going sometimes in the night. I laughed and said what 

group is going again that meetings to get a connection then. I felt that is the way to be 

because when you are a group, you live by yourself, and you don't know Œ no telephones, 

nothing. You don't know what's going to come  next, and they were spying. You have to 

have this. You have to know what your neighbor's doing. You have to know what's going 

on, and you have to know the other groups. You have to know what's in the, what's going 

on in the country or in Russia. We  knew about politics. We  knew everything was in the 

front. This in the front. This we knew ever
ything what's going on. I was reading papers. I 
was seeing everything clearly. Otherwise, we c ouldn't live. It was impossible. Of course, 

a lot of groups were Œ a lot of Jews run away, and they didn't have the organization. They 

didn't have the connections and they disappeared. They disappeared. The Pollacks killed 

them themselves or somehow the Germans Œ they told the Germans. They disappeared. 

Disappeared group by group disappeared. And I went through this Wi eprz. There was a 

whole story how we went through that. And we came over on the other side, and I was so 

tired. Unbelievably tired. And I was sorry that I brought them people on the other side 

because we were walking two days and two nights. We  didn't know where we are going. 

Completely! We were Œ like I say, I didn't have the connection. I didn't have the people 

around me . The neighborhood there I knew already. I knew where I'm going. And here I 

didn't know nothing. And we walked over to a farm, and we woke up a woma n there and 

she start screaming and crying, "Please don't do this.ﬂ I said, "Don't worry. We will not 

do nothing to you. Just let us in.ﬂ She said, "No, I can't  because I have a child is sick. 

Very sick. He had typhus or some thing and you will catch it too. Don't go in.ﬂ Said, 

"Okay, we will go in the barn.ﬂ We  went in the barn. We  were dead. We  were so tired of 

walking. I think it will start snowing or something later and there was a real night, I felt 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0087 
29 
half, half dying. And I lay down in the, the barn and all our people. We  always kept one 
me n to watch and all of a sudden ma ybe it was day already. I wake up and I see nobody's 

watching. Nobody! I woke up, and I was a very sleeper Œ  I, I could hear everything 

always when sleep. I don't know why. This was nature or some thing. I could hear 

everything. Whatever happened in sleep always, I could hear it. Then I walked over Œ I 

woked up, I went over to the door to the barn and I see, all of a sudden, I see Germans, 

Polish uniforms, the police, and farmers and the whole posse but still forming, still going.  
 

02:44:37 

 
And I woke up my people very fast. And we walked out with the front and shooting at 

them. They were not still organized. They were still starting something then, and we start 

shooting at them. And walked around the barn, and we start running away. Because they 

were an army there. Who knows how ma ny?  I didn't know. And we start running, 

running and we Œ I see very bad. There's no trees, nothing. We  are only a few houses 

there, and it is a field. They have a good field for us to shoot us when we running. They 

can shoot everybody. And little by little we start moving away, moving away and all of a 

sudden, I see one guy fall beside and then I see another one fall. They were not dead. Just 

one was shot in the foot, and one was some where else shot and he said, "Please take my 

rifle. I am dead. They will kill me anyway.ﬂ I said, "I don't need your rifle. I have mi ne.ﬂ 

I couldn't do nothing. Then all of a sudden I feel a shot. It was my finger here. I have still 

the finger here like this, shot here right here. I squeezed my hand. I see blood. Yes, I took 

out, I don't know, a handkerchief or something. I put it on. I didn't make a big deal of it. I 

was walking, walking. All of a sudden I feel a shot in my foot, in my leg. Yeah, right 

here. Through. And I cannot walk no more. I cannot walk. I was trying you know. 

Szengut right behind me, and he start pulling 
me . He said, "You have to walk.ﬂ In the 
meantime, the rest of the people Œ we were about 10 or 12 Œ start moving. You know, 

they cannot wait for me. They see this one is laying, another is laying, and he, he didn't 

leave me alone. He starts pulling me, and I start walking and walking. I see I still can 

walk. The bone wasn't  touched. And this was luck. It was just the meat here that was shot 

here. And I could walk. It was bleeding a little bit, but I still walked.  
 

02:47:17 

 
And we run over to a house there and we told the farmer, "Fast put on a horse and 

wagon,ﬂ Szengut said, ﬁand we will put on Œ I will put you down on this on the wagon 

and we will start running away with this.ﬂ Then all of a sudden I see the Germans right 

by the border there when I was, I was  there. They came out. And one starts talking 

Polish to me . And he says in Polish, "You're a Jew, bastard? " or some thing, this. And he 

aime d with a rifle this, and he didn't,  I don't know, he didn't hit me . I got up and Szengut 

grabbed me and left the horse with the wagon, and I start screaming with my people. I 

start screaming with my people, they rest, "Stop and start shooting back. Start shooting 

back because otherwise nobody will live.ﬂ And I remember like today this one of them 

guys, it was Andrejew. He was the first one. He turned around, took out the rifle, he was 

aimi ng at the Germans. The Germans stopped. They stopped. Right away they fell 

through the floor. And when he took out a fe
w of our people. There was a Finkel there 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0087 
30 
was a few four or five. They took out the rifl
es and they start shooting back. When they 
stopped the Germans, I had time to with Szengut to run away to come  over and we went 
over to a woods somewhere there around not far, and the Germans stopped a little bit 

behind and they had three of our people and I think they, they killed there because I know 

Œ don't know what happened to them again. And between them was this Majdanek, this 

guy what run away from Majdanek. He was killed there right away in this skirmi sh. And 

I run away to the woods. In the meantime, Szengut and another one, Finkel, they both 

went back to look. Maybe they can help some body to Œ they came to a farmhouse and 

they opened the door there, and when they opened the door Germans was sitting there. A 

whole bunch of them was sitting there, and they were singing or eating some thing. You 

know they, they had that trophy. They took away Œ I think they took away some  money 

from these three guys too. They had ma ybe a few Œ I don't know what kind money. And 

Finkel closed the door and Szengut had hand grenade and they threw in there the hand 

grenade into this, and they don't know what happened there. Then they run away, and 

they found me. I was still waiting.  
 

02:50:12 

 
And we took a farmer, stopped with a horse and wagon on this Œ put me  on this and they 

sat down and I was with Szengut and another one and they had another Œ they stopped 

other farmers when they Œ on the way and we start moving. And on the way I asked the 

farmer, "Maybe you will take me home because I am shot and I cannot Œ my finger start 

bothering me very much, more than the foot.ﬂ I said, "I cannot walk and I cannot, I 

cannot function.ﬂ He said, "You have to be he
lped.ﬂ I said, "Oh no, my wife is sick and 
there's a Œ I'm afraid, but I will bring you over. I have a farm and I have a man what 

works for me , and he will keep you. He will keep you there.ﬂ I said, "Alright, whatever 

he wanted to do.ﬂ And he brought me  over to another farmer and the farmer was very 

nice to me . They, they took a Band-Aid and they, they took some   water. I don't know 

what kind of water. They washed it and they cleaned it very, very nice. They, they helped 

me out. It took almost a half a day, something, I was there sitting. All of a sudden, 

shooting again. I was with Szengut, and another Piasecki was another guy. We were there 

in the partition there. The rest of the group was in another house. Start shooting in the 

house. Like a thunder. Shoot directly in the house. And the farmer showed me  the way 

out in the back and me and Piasecki. I got up and I said, "Where is  Henryk? ﬂ I said, 

"Where is Finkel? ﬂ And I start looking back and I don't see him. And the farmer said, 

"You cannot wait a second. Run. Run.ﬂ And from the back of the farm it was already 

start to be a little darkish and I run away with Piasecki, this guy. We run away both of us. 

And with my wounded foot then I had to walk a whole night. I was walking in the woods. 

Walking, walking, walking. It was day almost. I went over. I had no, no choice already. I 

didn't know what to do myself. I walked over to a farmer. ﬁYou should help me  

something or give me a piece of bread or something.ﬂ And I came over to the farm. The 

farmer boy standing there came out and said, 
"God, what are you doing here? "   He said, 

"The Germans were here last night here. And they killed one of your people," he said. 

And I figure out that that was Szengut. ﬁOne
 of you people was killed. And they took off 
even his boots they took off because he wo
re new boots. He said, "They took off his 
boots and they took him away. And you are here! How does it happen? "  I walked a 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0087 
31 
whole night in the woods and I came back to the same  spot. You know in the night, you 
don't know where you're going and there's a woods. You don't know it that way.  
 

02:53:16 

 
I came back to this house. Then in the day time, what I found out, the Germans are still 

there. They said, "No. No. They went away. But they still come  back or whatever.ﬂ They 

said, ﬁThey knew that the partisans here, the group is here.ﬂ I said, "I have no choice. In 

the daytime with this Piasecki, we were both of us we start moving back from where I 

came. I came back and I came over to the Wi eprz, to the river. There's a big river and you 

stay here a night. Cannot walk. Then all of a sudden came in a bunch, a bunch of Polish 

kids from school. They went there and they start screaming, "Jew. Jew.ﬂ I was so 

disgusted. At least I had something in my hand like glass. I will throw this as a bomb I 

said, ﬁif you don't go away, if you don't stop this screaming. ﬁThey shut up and then came 

in a ma n. I don't know, it looked like a school teacher. He was dressed up nice. He said, 

"What happened?  You are Œ you have a problem here? "   I said Œ I said, "Yes. I want to go 

through the Wi eprz.ﬂ I said, "How can I go? "  He said, "Don't worry. I will show you 

where.ﬂ He brought me over to a small house there, and there it was a guy with his Œ he 

had this Œ a boat, a small boat, and he was bringing over people on other side. That was 

his Œ he said, "You have money? "  Said, "No, I don't have no money, but I have a 

lighter.ﬂ I remember a very nice lighter. I had it from Kaganowicz, I forgot to tell the 

story. Kaganowicz was killed. And I took away a watch and some  lighter and I think he 

had some  money, and I took it away from him, and I had it with me . And this lighter I 

took out. "Show me  it works.ﬂ I showed him it works. "Okay.ﬂ For this lighter, he took 

me over on the other side with Piasecki. We came over to the other side. The other side I 

knew already where farmers are and this I came over and I see a light, some a farmer. I 

see a light. I say I was afraid. You know this?  I start looking near this and I came over 

and see the rest of my people are there. And they went Œ the Wi eprz, then they came back 

to this farmer. They knew also the farmer from before because we knew when we left. 

We met and they said, "Oh, you still alive. Somebody said that you are killed.ﬂ They 

didn't know. Szengut was killed because they said some body was wounded and he was 

killed. They knew already. Oh, they was so happy that I am alive, that Œ and I went back 

with this group. I remained maybe a day or something like a whole day without them too. 

They went for food or some thing and I was staying with them. It was also very, very bad. 

I was feeling very bad, but they left me  and they went. But they came for me , and we 

went together. We  went back to the place that we knew before. And they came over to a 

place where there was a bunker where I told them bunkers, and this Tolka had a bunker 

there before, before with his Markuszow people and Jegier and all those people.  
 

02:56:32 

 
And I came over. There's nobody there. They disappeared. And all of a sudden came over 

a Œ a father and daughter. Said, "No, Tolka is no more here. He's some where else. They 

built another bunker because he was afraid to stay here. He built for 40 people, he built a 

bunker somewhere else. I said, "Can I meet him.ﬂ The guy said, "Wait, maybe he has to 

come in here. Tolka has to come in here.ﬂ I said, "Alright.ﬂ And it didn't take long. This 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0087 
32 
Tolka came over with NamŠ with some body else. They said, "Look. Look here, I am 
wounded," and they said, "I haven't got where to take you. It's full there." "It's 40 

people," he said, "We have no food there. It's impossible that we should take you. No.ﬂ 

What can I do?  Then I remi nd myself I met a guy, Drop was his name, like a farmer, a 

Pollack, what was nice to us. And I went back to him. I came back to him and he was, he 

was so fond of me . He start kissing me . He was so, so happy to see me , and he saw me  in 

this condition and he kept me  ma ybe a few weeks, a few weeks and all 10 of our people 

were there. Ten Œ two or three was killed Œ about nine people. We were there in his home 

by this Drop. He went to a drug store. He bought for me  some , some thing to cover with 

and he helped me a lot. This finger gave me a lot of trouble. I got gangrene in this finger, 

and the whole hand was so we will have to cut this hand, but I had a very strong 

constitution and I felt good or whatever and it helped and it went away, but I have this till 

today. It's crooked. I can do nothing about it. I don't want to do nothing. The foot didn't 

gave me too much trouble. It was a time until it healed and I could walk and I was 

staying there. till February 14, 1943, I was by farm Œ Drop™s farm.

Q: As you were telling us, you were able to work your way through the first difficult 
encounter. You were wounded and you got some  
help. Now, we are at the point where 
you going to tell us about some  of the experiences you had with some  of the other 

partisan leaders, heroes, who had Œ whose name s you had me ntioned earlier.  
 

A: Like I said before, that in February ‚43, Drop, the farmer, came over to our place in the 
barn and we were there a few weeks already. And he says, "Listen, boys, I cannot keep 

you no Œ any longer. There is a problem.ﬂ I said, "What happened.ﬂ He said, "The 

bunker, from 40 people in the bunker with Jegier , they were all killed. And I am afraid 

now. It's not far from here," he said, ﬁIt was Amelin, was the name  of the town there, 

village, and it's not far from my place and I am afraid the Germans will kill me and kill 

you. Just tonight start walking.ﬂ And we went 
out. We start going to farmers in the night. 
We came over to one place, they kept us very nicely and we had a very good experience 

with her in the night a farm woman there with a family, and they were very nice to us. 

And she told us that she heard also what was going on there and that they killed 40 

people there in the bunker what Jegier and Tolka had the Russia. This was a lot of my 

friends. I felt very, very bad and it was upsetting and we were afraid too because now the 

Germans will go after us, because we see the end. It's no way out. But we come  to a farm 

like this and we got in touch back again with Genek Kami nski and we start telling him 

the story what happened. Then he knew t
oo. He knew what's  going on. After ma ybe two 
days, we walked around. All of a sudden in the night, we see a group is walking. Who 

knows?  During the night we had our things. We
 called "amkha," we called out. That was 
our Œ what do you call it?   
 

03:03:33 

 

Q: Code. 

 

A: Code. And we called out "Amkha," and they answered "Amkha.ﬂ We  said, "Who is this? "   
ﬁJegier.ﬂ Jegier with a group of people. Of course, it was Rubinstein, there Œ Sever Œ and 

other people. "Oh, my God, What happened? "  They said, "They killed you.ﬂ Said, 

"Happened that we went out Œ 14 people Œ we 
went out to forage there, to bring some  
food for the whole group and just at this night, when we walked out the Germans came  

in. Somebody told them. The farmers told them where we are located, and they killed 

every Œ they threw in hand grenades and they killed everybody in this.ﬂ Tolka and Mikoi 

and these fr iends of mi ne fr om Markuszow Œ all killed. But 14 of them some how got out. 

We were very happy to see them and we start moving together with. But still to go 

around with a bigger group was very dangerous and not practical. When we come  to a 

farm, "We can give you food for 10, eight people.ﬂ But to feed a group for 30, 40 was 

already a big deal. They didn't have even food for themselves. Then we divided, and 

Jegier  took his group, the Markuszow and ot
hers, whatever was left, and I had the 
prisoners of war I was with, but we kept very close touch. We  was almost two, three 

nights we had some  spots where we me t. We  ma de in advance, ﬁyou will be there and 

there,ﬂ or we knew what's  going always a few days.  

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0087 
34 
 
Q: I'd like to interrupt a moment because you mentioned again you had the prisoners of war 
with you. At any time, did you find that it was appropriate to involve wome n in any of 

your activities?   
 

03:05:41 

 

A: We  didn't think about then about wome n or not wome n. It was very, very hard for a ma n 
and if a woma n, it was almost impossible, but if a woma n would come  along, we would 

not send her away.  
 

Q: That was our way. But after a time, we had this experience and a woma n came along. 
Still we didn't take her with us, but she was near us. She went Œ whenever we went, she 

was walking with us all night, and then when we stayed in a place so we had to do 

some thing. They were staying in another place. There was a woma n with three me n. 

Where they came?  They came from Wa rsaw, she and another one. Her name  was, her 

name  was Hanka. Her friend was Halpern, the name  Halpern. They both jumped from a 

train what went from Wa rsaw to Treblinka. After the Wa rsaw, they had the, the fight 

there. They run. They caught them, and they were bringing them to Treblinka. They 

jumped out through the train. And when they came from the train, the farmers told them 

that we are out. She just jumped out Œ this luck Œ she jumped on the spot but where we 

were. But after a few days, it was just some  time when we knew we had a big job with a 

lot of people there. Came  in some  Polish Œ a group of Polish people were there, and they 

and us went for a big train, and we stopped the train and we burned down  ammunition 

and oil and gas and Œ and we took away a few Germans there. And we were not used to 

shoot people there but there was some  of them, officers from the Polish group said, 

"What are you waiting, you Jews?  You are afraid to kill? "  They killed right away the 

Germans there. But we little by little we got used to this blood, but still it wasn't  my, my 

genes to kill people. I, I couldn't do it, but  I want to talk to you now about helping them. 

When I me t this Hanka, she was completely out. She was hungry and barefoot. It was 

unbelievable. One thing she has, she has a big hat. She covered her hair that they 

shouldn't see that she is a girl. She was afraid because girls was a problem. They didn't 

want that, so she put on a hat and covered her hair. She had short hair, covered. And she 

was in a blouse something, very, very bad shape. and I started talking to her. She told me 

the story about Wa rsaw ghetto. I didn't know what happened there.  
 

03:08:58 

 
That's why I say through communication we 
find out what's  going on, we found out what, 

what's going on, and happened she was her family or some thing from this leader 

Anielewicz
28
, and she knew what's going on there. She told us the whole story how the 
fight was going on. A lot of people run away, a
nd they are looking for partisans to fight, 
to go some where. And I kept her around me . She was officially like my girl, you know, 

because I took care of her and I watched her, but she couldn't be with us to do some  work

or to live together in the quarters. They lived separately. And walking around there, I 
came to a farmer and there's like a small child three, four years, a girl, laying there dirty. 

She had Œ full of rats, she was Œ terrible situation she looked. And I took Œ I told Œ I said, 

"Who is this child.ﬂ He doesn't  know, the farmer. He doesn't  know. He found her on the 

street. I figured right away, it's a Jewish girl. And I cleaned her up and I brushed her and I 

stayed already and they special for her and I told the farmer, in no two ways, "This girl 

has to live and this girl you will feed and you will watch her.ﬂ He said, "I am afraid the 

other farmers will tell on me.ﬂ I said, "Good.ﬂ I went out. The whole village was not too 

big. It was a small one. And I knocked on the doors and the windows at night and I said, 

"Listen, there will be in two weeks a young gi
rl comi ng to you to live with you. You keep 
her. And this girl, if some thing will happe
n to her, you will all be burned down.ﬂ "You 
reme mber we burned down a place, I said to them. That will happen to you people.ﬂ "No. 

No. I will take care of it.ﬂ Thank God, they 
took care of this kid. It did live through the 
war. She's today a teacher in Israel in the high school and I met her there when I was on 

™81, I met her, and she's healthy. She's married, and she has a nice family and I was very, 

very happy. She was happy to see me  too. And she, she thanked me  very well for this.  
 

Q: I™m sure. If we think back to the actual experience of having a woma n join Œ Hanka join 
the group, you continued on in your military activities for some time.  
 

A: Absolutely. It had nothing to do with her. Sh
e was on the side, but I want to bring out, if 
you talk about women, we will talk about this later. We got a order that we cannot stay in 

this neighborhood no more. It was very dangerous there. A lot of Germans came in there. 

In the neighborhood     
 

03:12:24 

 

Q: Where did your orders come  from?   

 

A: Through this  Kami nski, everything goes there. We  had a Œ name  by the name :  Mietek 
Moczar, he came to us. He looked a little bit like you. Tall and yes, handsome man. He 

was, he was in a uniform for a ma jor in the Polish army. Eloquent. The ma n could speak 

nice and also he came to us to pep us up, to talk to us, and he was a few weeks with us. 

Maybe two weeks, he was working with us. He took part in our actions, whatever that™s 

supposed to be done. And he was very close with me . Some how we got friendly, and we 

kept this friendship until he died now. Later, he died in Poland. And there was another 

one with the name  ﬁBolek Alef,ﬂ Bolkowiak
29
. He was after the war a general in Poland. 
He stayed in Poland. This ma n was also from Wa rsaw. He was in action in Wa rsaw, in 

the ghetto and he ran away from the ghetto and he came to the woods. But he was like an 

activist. He went, he didn't stay in one place. He was going from one group to the other, 

from one place to the other Polish groups and other groups. Whatever it was group he 

was talking to as a speaker, a good one, and he was a Œ I think he was a lawyer for the 

war too. Bolek Alef, he™s now Œ he died also two years ago in Poland. And they were all 

Œ others they came to us. You say, ﬁWho? ﬂ The people, they had the connections through

this Genek, he was arranging this and they came. They knew where we are,  and in the 
night we were in this and this village. We  me t, and this one thing when Moczar Œ when 

he came, we ordered the whole village Œ a few villages together, and he spoke to them. 

And he spoke to them, he made a political Œ told them, "Listen. Those partisans, they are 

fighters. They are Jews. They are doing their job and we are working together and help 

them and work with them.ﬂ It was very, very important for us because, you know, we 

were not alone. That's what I said all the time. We were with an organization. We worked 

with them. And this helped. All the time came in, there was a Polish group there what 

they were fighting as partisans but they were home more. When they are needed, they 

came out. When we did something Œ there's a train or something, they came with us and 

they helped us. Wa s a Franek Œ was a guy, Przybyszówka was a village. It was a very 

important group because they helped us a lot. And they had some  connections with 

Russia, too, and Moczar had a connection with Russia. And an order came that we should 

go away from this.  
 

03:15:36 

 

Q: Again, I'm interested in the fact that you had an order that you were following.  

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: Your organization. How would you describe it to us?   

 

A: We were a very loose organization. We did whatever we had to do. When it came Œ the 
Germans came in the mi ddle of night. When they caught us by surprise or some thing, we 

didn't have to ask some body what to do. We  were on our Œ on our Œ  on our own. And 

when Jegier said Œ let's say he was working with this group, he was on his own. And I 

with my group I was on my own. And then we me t and we talked together you know. 

And we said what we will do, where we will go, how we will do things everything 

because the connections what they gave us was a big help to us. First, of course, before 

they said, they have to wait for the Russians, and this was a big thing already because 

Russia start sending material, ammunitions and this, and food even they was end people. 

They were ending up to the back Œ front they came, they was partisans and they came to 

us. Everybody came to us. But we, as Jews, didn't have the, the force but together we 

were a big group and we had a paper. We  gave
 out a paper. It was Œ every action we was 
taken is still today written down. Maybe we will be in Poland, check. If they have the 

actions of their group from Emilia Plater was the name  of my group, Emilia Plater. 
 

Q: What does the name Emilia Plater stand for?  

 

A: Emilia Plater was the leader from the fr
eedom of Poland before Poland was under Russia, 
under Germany and Austria, years ago in the 17s. And this Emilia Plater was a fighter 

like Kosciuszko
30
, Pulaski
31
. She was one of them fighters against tyranny of the Czar 
                                                 
30

and we took the name , Emilia Plater. She was a woma n fighter then. I had another goes Œ 
the first time was Kozietulski
32
 but not too long. She was also a fighter for freedom.  
 

03:17:51 

 

Q: You had mentioned earlier the relationship with the A.L..  

 

A: Yeah. That was the relationship with A.L.. The other group was the A.K., Armi a 
Krajowa. Then people were Œ it was like here, the Republicans and the Democrats. The 

democrat was more to the left, they was more to the right. The A.K. wasn't  Œ wasn't  100 

percent antisemitic, but they didn't like Jews. But they didn't let's say kill directly. They 

were not friendly to us. But we me t once in while because we caught Œ a guy came from 

London. He was thrown down by a parachute, to help the partisans, whatever. And he 

was from the A.K. He told us right away. We  caught him. He fell into our hands. And he 

start talking to us, and he showed us how to ma ke hand grenades, a big one he was 

ma king. And he was with us a few days. Then we brought him over. He said he wants to 

go. He has contacts and he wants to go i
mme diately. And you shouldn't bring him. We 
were very careful, but we brought him over there, and they ma de a party for us. They 

gave us food because they knew the guy. Nothing happened to us and we were very 

careful. We  were standing outside. The whol
e group. We  were two or three people only 

working. Jegier  and me  worked, and the rest were standing outside to watch. But we 

didn't feel comfortable with them let's say put it this way. If they Œ they caught a Jew 

separately on his own, they will kill. You know, as a group, they couldn't start with us. 

They, they Œ they knew that what could happen to them. They didn't want to start with us. 

But individuals, if they caught some body,  they Œ they caught the Morel, I told. That was 

also from the A.K. We  burned down the whole village because of this, that™s why.  
 

03:19:58 

 

Q: Let's bring you toward the conclusion.  

 

A: Yeah. Then the order came we should go the other side. And when we came to the 
Wi eprz, then they divided us. Jegier with 
a group, and my group was divided Jegier  went 
away with Œ some  parachutes came down. Some  Russian groups came down and he had 

to bring him over to some  Œ kind of place. He was to stay with them. And I went over to 

the other side of the Wi eprz, between Wi eprz and Bug. There were other groups there, 

and we have to unite because we cannot stay there. First of all, the terrain Œ the place 

where we were, were very antisemitic. They, they were known. We  lived there from day 

to day because we had pistols, we had rifles. When we came to a farmer, he couldn't say 

nothing because he was afraid of us. But we didn't have the work with them you know. 

You couldn't work with them. The other side were, were the White Russians. They Œ I 

don't know Œ some how they were better to us and they were nicer people. And then they 

helped us and they told us to go there on the other side. And on the way, there a very big 

fight by the Wi eprz, by crossing the Wi eprz. The Germans were there and waiting for us 
                                                 
32

38 
and we almost didn't ma ke it to Wi eprz. They, they, they ma de a ring around us, and they 
were shooting and some how some way we run through this one guy helped us with a boat, 

from our people other side and no one was killed. Nobody. And we came  out on the other 

side, and the other side, they were shoot Œ the Pollacks, the A.K. were shooting on us. 

They didn't know who this was, was all mi xed up there. And the Germans pinned down a 

group of very, very important me n from Russia that came to Janowski
33
, he was a writer 
from a ma in paper in Poland after the war. And they pinned them down. They couldn't Œ 

they couldn't move. They couldn't walk through the Wi eprz, they couldn't. They stayed 

on the other side. We  went through again. Then again an order came back say, "Go and 

rescue him.ﬂ We  went back. About four, or 
five people, was Bleichma n, Finkel, and other 

Zelazny. We  went back and we took a boat, some  wires, some thing Œ I don't reme mber 

exactly what it was. We  brought over the whole group Œ 20 people. We  brought those 

whole Œ oh, he said this Janowski came from Russia. He was a big shot from there 

already. And he said, "You will get me dals for this. You, you did a job like.ﬂ He was 

wounded, too. We  was carrying on our hands. I reme mber, Zelazny, he was very strong 

ma n, we carried with his hands.  
 

03:23:02 

 
We  carried him over. And we came to another place, another group, and after a few days, 

we met Chiel Grynszpan
34
. Chiel Grynszpan had a group already from 40, 50 people 
there. And then people were from the neighborhood people. He himself was a soldier. He 

was a Œ whatever it is Œ cavalry me n, on horses. He always liked to be on a horse and he 

felt good with this. And he, he was a very plain ma n, a good ma n, and a good soldier. He 

had a discipline with them people. We  needed it because nobody knew how to keep a 

rifle, nothing. He was the only one there th
at knew some thing. There was another one 

later on. But he  Œ he ma naged. He was there imme diately. When we came down, he was 

happy. They really loved us, because we became soldiers. We  became some  kind of a 

army and together right away, we started 
on trains. This is how highways, trains, 
communications lines cut and we together. Big train, but river and it was a bridge. 

Thunder. We  broke down the whole bridge, you know. It was on the border, the train. 

And the same  time I was with another group, ma ybe a hundred people. There was 

children and wome n and all kinds of this there, and I found there. And I had to carry 

them too. And on the way, like I say, we were the first one always to go. I walked straight 

on a German with a rifle. And I walked them into the rifle. Imagine how that Œ how I felt. 

I stand still like a, like a dummy. I didn't know what to do. And all my people Œ was 

ma ybe a 100 of them Œ all disappeared. In a second, I didn't see nobody. Myself I stand 

on the highway.  
 

Q: Let's just ma ke sure we understand. You came upon this large group of people.  

 

A: This was Chiel™s people.

Q: Chiel™s people. And then you were walking with them.  
 

A: Wa lking with them.  

 

Q: You're in the lead.  

 

A: In the lead.  

 

Q: And then again as you were walking the lead, what happened?   

 

03:25:48 

 

A: A German was standing with a rifle and Istopped. It was dark, pitch dark. A mome nt ago 
I was on a horse, a white horse I remember, and I had enough of the horse and I gave it to 

another one and I was walking. In from right there. He saw us and he heard us because 

we were talking. In Yiddish we talked, a
nd everything was loud. Then he was by himself 
there standing. And I came over and I saw a German. I said Œ I start talking German to 

him Œ I said, "Was machen Sie hier?
35
ﬂ ﬁWhat are you doing here in the night? "   He said, 
"Look behind me.ﬂ I looked. There's a dark like this, there's a truck, a whole truck. I said, 

"There's more Germans? "  He said, "Yes. There's in the truck sleeping people, and two of 

them walked out for help.ﬂ ﬁWhat happened? ﬂ  ﬁWe are stuck. We was Œ a whole column 

went through here, and I am stuck with a fe w people stuck here on a truck.ﬂ So, ﬁyou are 

ours,ﬂ we took him down.  
 

Q: Let's slow down. You were standing there.  

 

A: Yeah. Rifle Œ  I start talk to him Œ he gaveme the rifle. He gave me the rifle, just like 
that. I couldn't believe it. He just handed over to me. And then all my people came up Œ 

get up, took over the wome n, and he walked up. I said, "There's some body in.ﬂ He said, 

"Yes.ﬂ "Wake him up.ﬂ We  woke up two guys. One was a black uniform from SS like, 

and the other one was in a plain uniform. And he said, ﬁTwo went away, but I don't know 

where they are, but two are here.ﬂ And all three we took away and the, the truck we 

destroyed completely, and we took out a lot of rifles there, ammunition, and some 

communications they had, wire, some radio something. We destroyed everything 

completely. It took us almost a whole night to work on this and it was daylight almost in 

the morning, and in the summer it gets six Œ five o'clock was there, and said, "Let's 

disappear from there," and we went.  
 

Q: It must have been an incredible experience to find threeŠ 

 

A: Oh,yes. 

 

Q: German who so easily allowed themselves to beŠ 

 
                                                 
35
 W h at are you doing here?  (German) 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0087 
40 
A: Easily. 
 

Q: How do you explain that?   

 

A: They were regular army. They weren't in a column there. They didn't know what 
partisans is. They didn't know what's going on here altogether. They didn't have an idea. 

Here come s over a ma n talks to him in German, and he didn't know what happened to 

him. You know, he didn't realize that, that I am the enemy. You know?   
 

Q: You were in a German uniform at that time?   

 

A: I had a coat. I had a German coat, and I spoke German, and he didn't realize what 
happened, and the others simply got up. And the other two simply got up. They had no 

choice. The others had no choice because we saw them waking up. They were sleeping. 

They were told to come  out, and we were start dragging them around with me.  
 

03:39:01 

 

Q: Then what happened to them.  

 

A: Then we were ma ybe a week ma ybe. Some how we couldn't get nobody. The line of 
communication was very, very bad. It was times that the Germans were all over. 

Wherever we moved, the Germans were there. And we had to stay still, to wait, to go 

later. He was, was with, with his people, and I was with my people there. And I, I had 

wome n and children and everybody. This wasn't  the regular group. It was just a put 

together. Just for one day suddenly. ‚Cause Œ I will tell you how it happened. We had the 

children with us, and we start dragging them around and the Pollacks start screaming at 

us, "The Germans will look for them," and you have to do something. I didn't want to kill 

them. I had pity special on this one what gave me the rifl e. I, I didn't feel like killing him. 

Till today, I am sorry because the ma n was decent you know. He, he was a soldier and he 

gave me  the rifle and didn't nothing. He coul
d shoot me  like nothing. He was in Œ he saw 

me  and he gave it, and I didn't know. And we kept him ma ybe a week or two until we me t 

with Chiel back again and there's another group come over there, Russians and all this, 

and we ma de a meeting with three or four officers. And we talked it over and said, "They 

have to be killed. What they doing with us, they caught Œ they catch us? They Œ not only 

they kill us, but they torture us. They cut pieces from us.ﬂ In fact, they cut one of my 

people. They caught once. They cut pieces from him. They put to a tree and they cut Œ 

with a knife they cut pieces from him. Lapides(ph) was his name . And that's what they 

were doing with the partisans when they catch them. And they said, "What shall we do 

with them? ﬂ  I said, ﬁMaybe you should wait.ﬂ I wanted Œ and there was already 

headquarters there. We had in one place headquarters already from Moczar there, and one 

with Zymi erski there and all the big shots were there sitting Œ Bolek Alef and Zemsta
36
 
came also, the guy. And I said, "Maybe we should.ﬂ And they said, "No, we will not drag 

them out. We  don't know how to get there. It's very hard now to go and communicate.ﬂ 
                                                 
36
 Major Aleksander ﬁZemstaﬂ Skotnicki 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0087 
41 
But that time week or two, we got to Œ to the headquarters. We came there. First thing I 
reported to him Œ to Moczar, that I caught three Germans and I had all the documents 

from there. I took away all the documents. I had their names and everything. Then one of 

the Polish guys was, was some thing. I don't know what it was ma d at me , jealous or what 

it is because he didn't want to give a rifle, some thing from there that we took away. And 

he went over to, to Moczar and he told them that we killed innocent people, three guys, 

Germans. And Moczar said to me , "What do you mean you killed three Germans?  You 

have no right to kill nobody.ﬂ And he start screaming at me and all this, and I had already 

Œ I was a officer already. I took off my Œ I was 
a lieutenant Œ he took off. He said, "you're 
dismissed,ﬂ and all this. And in a day after Chiel came back and all this, he start talking 

and he said, "I have everything what I wanted
 to know.ﬂ He gave me  go back. He said to 
me  not to do it no more because they have to have some  kind of an army. It's not Œ you 

cannot do whatever you want.  
 

03:32:40 

 

Q: So in fact the three soldiers were killed.  

 

A: Killed. 

 

Q: Who killed them?  

 

A: Our people. Three people. I know even exactly. I don't want to tell the names. Our 
friends, they are today Œ one of them is in Florida, one is in Israel. Out right, yeah. 
 

Q: During the experiences that you describe Œ and we™ll pick that up Œ but you raised the 
point, other people killing Germans, can you recall your own experiences killing 

Germans?   
 

A: We  had a lot of fights with Germans. We  were shooting to them and they shot at them. I 
don't know if they were killed. I assume d that they were killed also. When they were 

shooting the rifle the bullet goes to, to them like they go to us. And they were all going 

from us open, they were not afraid Jews, they'r e not afraid. They go. And they were 

shooting back. I'm sure they were killed, but directly to shoot. You had only three guys 

when you shot Œ went into a train, but we didn't shot. The Pollacks shot them. But it's 

different. It was our group that shot them, and 
then three were shot directly from us. We 
had later on more, but this was till then. And we Œ I told you straight, us Jews we had 

once affect, we had a guy what was a Pollack and he was with us, and he denounced us. 

He was with us, fighting with us, going with us and he had a chance. He just disappeared 

for a few mi nutes and he told some body. He 
had contact where we were going and what 
we are doing. And we, we found out very fast th
at he's doing this. When we find out that, 
the ma n cannot live with us. Then who will kill him?  Nobody wants to kill him. And they 

came the Polish guys what I told you, they helped us out they were kids. They were kids, 

that one Franek, he said, ﬁHere, you shoot the ma n like this.ﬂ And he took out a pistol 

and he shot him. We didn't have the guts to shoot somehow. I was a military man, but 

still directly to shoot in a fight it's different. Directly to shoot wasn™t to easy. Okay now, 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0087 
42 
we went in a, in a village. The name  was Bojki, and in Bojki we were staying two and a 
half months, in one spot. And there we formed a real army. We  formed groups. You 

know we ma de groups, small ones. Every one group had a leader and we ma de a military 

establishment. And people were going out, out just to big farms we went out. We  

collected cows and food, swine, whatever it is, whatever we needed for food, and we 

brought it over, and we had a base. We  was staying there. The Germans knew that we are 

there. The Pollacks knew we are there. Nobody bothered us. We  are staying there. We 

went out every night, for trains or whatever
 you had to do. We  walked away from there. 
And they were not doing nothing. In fact, they had on the woods Œ we were Œ not too far 

was woods Œ was a sign, "Here Partisans," and they shouldn't go in Œ individual Germans, 

or something like that.  
 

03:36:06 

 

Q: You have to explain to us. Why do you think or why is it in fact that the Germans did not 
come?  
 

A: It was in ‚44 already. This was ‚44. The Germans had full hands on the fronts all over. 
We  knew what's going on. We  had the leaders, from the group. You had Œ what's his 

name? Moczar. And what's their name? Bolek Alef and Zemsta came from all over 

Russia was helping Œ started to help alrea
dy. And we were an army already. We  knew 
that we are not Œ we will not just give up and they knew that need a lot of military men to 

cope with us. They need airplanes. They need artillery. They cannot just come in just to 

fight with us right then. They knew that.  
 

Q: What size force did you have?   

 

A: We  had a few hundred people. And then was a group of Russians there. Chorny
37
, 
Biely(ph), a lot of Partisans were there in these woods there. A lot! Thousands already. 

And they Œ the Russians knew Œ the Germans knew that they are there, and they didn't 

come. For a long, for a long time they didn't touch us. Then the front start comi ng near, 

and May First, came Rola Zymi erski, to us. He was the leader of the whole army. He was 

a general before the war, a very fine ma n, a older ma n. And he spoke to the whole 

population. He called over everybody and he spoke to them and he talked to them about 

the partisans. It wasn't  only Jews then. It was Pollacks, Russians, everybody. And he said, 

"The Russian fr ont is very near, and these days we will be taken over by the Russians and 

we will take over Poland back again.ﬂ Talked openly. He already was sure of himself. 

And then he came over to me  and to Chiel Grynszpan, because Chiel and I worked 

together then. Jegier, by the way, before when we divided, was killed. In a skirmi sh with 

Germans, he was killed. And there was no more Jegier and I was with Chiel. I had my 

group. He had his group but we kept togeth
er. And what I want to say isŒ

Q: The Germans, yeah. They were all, all over already. They were Œ the Russians were Œ the 
contact with the Russians was so near. In fact they had a whole delegation came  to us in 

the woods, and they came to me  and said, "Listen, we have confidence in you, your 

group. Give me  10 people, whatever, to bring over the governme nt, the future 

governme nt of Poland to Russia. We  have them right here. And I want you to give us 

some  people.ﬂ And I gave Morel, Bleichma n, a nice group of 10 people. I gave them to 

them and they carried over the main delegation from the Polish government to Russia, to 

Moscow. And they ma de it. They brought them over to airplane. They had a skirmi sh 

there with some  Hungarians that were fighting for Œ with the Germans. Hungarians were 

fighting with the Germans Œ Ruma nians were fighting with the Germans, there, on their 

side. And some how they brought them over. They brought them over. They brought them 

and they went to Russia, and they formed a governme nt. But it was our group that carried 

them through there. And they remembered this. Moczar Œ when I was there latest with 

Moczar he remembered this, the we took over Œ the group that took over the government.  
 

Q: The front was quickly moving to your area.  

 

A: The front was moving very rapidly. It was

Q: Rockets? 

 

03:40:32 

 

A: Rockets. And we hear artillery. We  can h
ear airplanes too. And almost every few days 
the Russians came down to us and threw down ammunition, rifles, people. They came  in 

Œ one group came in 70 people. We  called them ﬁskoczki
39
.ﬂ That me ans they jump Œ 
jumpers. They came in 70 people. Most of them were Jews, officers, trained in Russia or 

some where, and they came to us. And wome n came over and now the story about ladies, 

wome n. Hanka was the only one wome n what I knew that she is around like this. And I 

didn't know. When I came to Chiel, I find there a whole group of people, old, young, 

children. There were a few hundred hidden in a wood, in a very, very strange pieces of 

land there. It was water and you couldn't get there. No German, nobody could get there. 

And they pushed them there on this land, and they put them there. And then they were 

bring to them food, some thing once in awhile. Not too much. They were hungry. And 

when I came, she said to me , "This is people what I know. They are almost from my 

villages there. I know most of them people." Pollacks came over to me and they said they 

will kill all of them if they wouldn't stop gr
abbing the chickens and the food in the night. 
And they didn't have what to eat, and they ran out in the night. They were going to the 

farmer. And the farmers were ours, because we were standing Œ they knew us. We  had a 

base, and they came to Chiel and they told him Œ they said they will kill all the children

and women. Then he call over, ﬁMietek,ﬂ he said, ﬁI cannot go to them people because 
we have to do some thing. To kill some body there or to do some thing.ﬂ He said, 

"Otherwise, they will kill all of us too. Not only them, but they will Œ    Farmers you 

cannot stop because they are our bread and butter. We  have to work with them.ﬂ Then I 

went there with three people. I reme mber Rabinowitz(ph), from Wa rsaw, guy on horse, 

otherwise, you couldn't walk through there, water was there. You know, the horses went 

through everything. And I came to the place.  
 

03:43:02 

 
I came to the place. I couldn't believe it. When I remi nd myself, I want to cry now. It was 

my job. People naked, half naked. Ladies! Men! Children! Everybody, they had some  

kind of covers they had. They ma de. They built. Not on the ground. On top. And they 

were cooking, ma king food, some thing for the family.. When I saw this group, I couldn't 

Œ I couldn't believe. I see people. It's like from the old times. You see in the Œ from the 

history books. You see people like this. And in between I looked down and I see a 

woman. She looks like my mother. Imagine! And here I came in this in to kill them. I 

have to kill somebody or I have to do something. I see my mother there. I went over to 

her and I talked to her and I said, "Where you come from? "   And I talked to others. And 

then I put them together, and lined up and I said, "Listen people. You want to live. You 

have to behave. You have to do some thing else. You cannot just go to the farmers, rob 

them. Wait for us. Organize something. There should be some organization because 

otherwise, they will Œ you will perish and we 
will perish altogether. And they told me 
that a few youngsters there what were really no good. They were robbing. I said, "You 

three will come  with me .ﬂ They, they had some  mothers there. They had two sisters, and 

they thought I'm going to kill them. And that was the, the, the order to kill them. And I 

said, "Oh no, I will not kill nobody here. They depend on me absolutely. I'm not killing 

nobody.ﬂ After going through a thing like this, and I took them away and I brought them 

over to the group, them three and they were very, very good soldiers there. One is still 

today my best friend. Whenever he sees me , he doesn't  know what to do with me . All 

three left with me  and they are Œ they were with me . But the group Œ the wome n, it was at 

a time the Pollacks still didn't give up. They have to be feeded. I said, ﬁThis is no good. 

We  have to take them away.ﬂ And we brought the whole group, little by little, not in one 

shot, into the group, into the village there nobody should know. Not even the 

headquarters didn't know, nobody didn't know. And we brought over Œ and every group Œ 

we had ma ybe a 100, 120 people there, and every group we took in one or two wome n 

and they were cooking for us because we were standing in one place. They were cooking, 

they were washing. We  had shirts to wash or some thing. Then the wome n start working 

for us and they were doing group Œ some  of them were very brave, and they said, "What 

do you mean washing this?  We  want to have a rifle too.ﬂ And have a Dora and another 

one there, Roska,  and this, and they, they picked up rifles. They put on rifles and they 

went out to work with us, the wome n you know, after a time that everything calmed 

down.

Q: How did they function?   
 

A: They did Œ were very, very, very good because they have a group had to Œ then they had 
Œ they had to behave. You know they were soldiers. Everybody was a soldier. Hanka had 

the worse time she had than everybody else. She came from Wa rsaw. She came Œ she was 

a very, very delicate wome n Œ she was from a good home. She had ma ids home, and she 

didn't know what to do with herself. Others were from farms, from villages. They, they, 

they coped. They knew how to cook. They knew how to do some thing for us, and some  

of them baked for us. We  had a good time. But she, she was lost. Completely lost! She 

couldn't Œ she was Œ it was so dirty here. She, she couldn't Œ she didn't keep herself good. 

I had a very, very hard time with her really to keep her alive and to keep her around 

there. Also, she was very small and beautiful. She was a beautiful wome n, with dark hair. 

She was very, very nice. I liked her very much, and she liked me. But I couldn't even 

come  near her. She was so Œ I knew she was dirty, and after a time she was assigned to 

watch for a guy what was wounded in a fight. She, she went away from me , and she was 

staying with this guy until the war ended. I didn't see her no more. But before we divided 

two the groups divided to. What happened. When Rola Zymi erski came First of May, and 

told us that near Œ the front is near. He said, "You have to disappear from this terrain, 

from this land. We  have to go deeper and fight other Germans, deeper, deeper to the 

We ichsel to go deeper into the country, to the west. The Bug was east, and we have to go 

to the west. Then I remember I went, ﬁChiel,ﬂ I said, ﬁListen, what shall we do? "  I was 

afraid of these Pollacks there on the other side. They were not too friendly to us, and here 

we had no freedom. We  were staying in one place for so ma ny months. We  knew the 

people already, and they knew us. We  lived. Then I said, "Maybe we shouldn't go.ﬂ And 

Chiel said the same  thing, "I know the people here, they knew me .ﬂ They know Chiel. 

Big shot he came with his horse. They all Œ they, they respect. And he liked to drink, he 

liked wome n. He was a good leader, you know, a real one, a partisan. I was more the 

intelligent type you know. It was Œ when they needed some thing, they came to me , and I 

have Œ I took care of everything. But he was a soldier. And I said, "We will not go.ﬂ And 

I went over to  Rola Zymi erski and I said, "You're going away, and this piece of land 

stays empty. Nobody from, from the partisans, nobody will be here. Let us be the guard. 

When the Russian fr ont come  near, we will go come  Œ we will go back. But in the 

meantime, we will need 100 people here just to cover your retreat when you go back to 

them.ﬂ  
 

03:49:53 

 
He said, "It's a idea. Stay.ﬂ And we remained here, and I remained there with 100 people 

we rema ined on the site of the Wi eprz Œ between the Wi eprz and the Bug. And they went 

Œ the Wi eprz, they went through, and they went to the terrain where I was before. 

Garbów, Lubartów, and other towns there. It didn't take too long. The Pollacks, the A.K., 

they came over to me , and he said, "You want to live. You want to live the group Œ a 

group nice there. You have to belong to us. You have to get with us together and work 

together. You cannot be on your own because everybody left Œ not you, not the Russians, 

not the Pollacks, everybody already. Only here you are, you are group. You have to 

belong to us.ﬂ I said, "Oh, oh, this is, this is death.ﬂ Meantime Œ the same time

Baranovskiy
 40
 a general from Russia came down with airplanes, and the whole group of 
real army. I'm telling you soldiers one by one. They were really equipped. Everything 
too. And this Baranovskiy we found out through channels he's a Jew too, but he didn't 

give it up. He didn't. He never said that he's a Jew. And after a few days, we said, ﬁWhat 

do we have to do the A.K.? ﬂ  We  said, ﬁWe will go over to Baranovskiy and want to me et 

him. They say he came over on the terrain there.ﬂ And we went to help him and how he 

can help us. We  came over to him. He had a wife with him, and he had a pirate, a pirate, 

that™s a pirŒ that is a big bird, and he had caviar and he took us in like a Œ and it was 

something else. We were dressed military dressed, very nice Œ I think was good looking 

then Œ and he start talking to me right way in Russia because I understood Russia, the 

Polish Russia. And he said, "What you, what you have to go by yourselves? ﬂ   He 

proposed us until I Œ we didn't even say nothing. He said, "Come to me . Come  to us. We  

will form one group. We  have a few hundred people and you be there. I see you are 

soldiers. You are in that group. You come  to us.ﬂ And that's what we were waiting for. 

And we came, the whole  group came to Baranovskiy. And when we came to 

Baranovskiy, he took us in, he divided with 
us right away. ﬁNo more Jews,ﬂ he said. 
ﬁYou cannot be Jews. By a group you have to be separate. Every group, Russian, Polish, 

Ukrainian, whatever it is. You cannot be Jews by themselves. This is our policy. And this 

is it. You can do that otherwise. Whatever you want, you have to be divided.ﬂ In the 

meantime, he ma de me  Œ and he ma de a group in Russian Œ Russian kept separate, and he 

ma de from Polish people, A.L. he called them. The are Armi a Ludowa. He ma de a group, 

and I was Œ he ma de me  the leader. From Pollacks and from Jews and I was the leader of 

them. Not Chiel, Chiel stayed.  
 

03:53:12 

 
Then one night he calls me , Chiel, he calls out, "Listen you two. I want you to leave. I am 

sending you to Moscow, you two.ﬂ I said, "What do you mean?  we'll leave the people," I 

said. "Never mi nd, you two. I have very important papers. I have to send them over.ﬂ 

ﬁHow you will do? ﬂ  ﬁI ma ke a conference from all officers, Russian, Polish, anyone, and 

when I will say I have a mi ssion and I need volunteers. Then you two get up fast because 

you knew already what to do. You get up, you two. When you are up that's it. I have to 

send you two.ﬂ And we came to the meeting and sat and meantime at the meeting, there 

came a guy from Wa rsaw ghetto. He run away. He was a politician. He was Œ I think he 

was a communist, something like that. He was the political fi gure there. He said, "I'm 

going, too, at this meeting.ﬂ He goes to the meeting too. And he knows about us that have 

to get up and we'r e together and we sit three of us together and all of sudden, this General 

Baranovskiy says, "I have to send out some  people with papers and all this. Who 

volunteers? "  Well, he gets up the first, Rubinstein
41
 he and Chiel after him, and I 
rema ined. Only two. And I rema ined there.  
 

Q: I am going to ask you in the few mi nutes we have left to focus on the closing days of the 
war.

A: Yeah. That's what will come .  

 

Q: Where you are now.  

 

A: That's it. Then, then I remained myself here with Chiel away and they had very important 
papers and then they went together to the border to the river that they have to cross. 

There's a Pollack what knows where to cross, and he is the first one. He walks them into 

the river. He fells into the river. After him goes Rubinstein. The Œ Politruk, they called. 

He walks in. He fell in the water. And Rubinstein ma de a ﬁgevalt
42
,ﬂ starts screaming. He 
fell in the water with the uniform whatever, and he start screaming and the water was 

high over him and the Germans were not too far and they start shooting him already. We 

had to retreat completely. We came back. And this day when he retreated we had a big, 

big fight. The biggest one in the partisans. We had there one of the partisans. If the 

Germans find out that Baranovskiy is there, the group, he lives openly, you know they 

fi nd out, they came with artillery. Like I said they didn't come fr om soldier. They came 

artillery, airplanes and  Œ what's the name? And the tanks and all this came over.  
 

Q: Just one big battle.  

 

03:56:09 

 

A: Big, big battle. Big battle! And the same day the other group what went the other side to 
my end was a part of my group too went to show the way there because was Œ what was 

the names?  What was his name?  Morel, Zelazny, Bleichman Œ you will hear a lot because 

he will I think he will be also there. And they Œ he went back with this group, and they 

had the biggest fight also in the war. Because the Germans want to clean up the partisans. 

They knew what's going on. The knew that the army's comi ng back. When the army 

comes back, they will hinder us whatever. They were afraid. Then they had a order to 

clean us up.  
 

Q: What did they do?   

 

A: And they had a very big fight there. Bigger than ours, ma ybe, with this and they had a lot 
of people. A lot of people! But in the night, they disappeared.  
 

Q: The Germans disappeared?  

 

A: No, the Germans was staying there, but our
 people disappeared in the night. Most of 
them came back to us. They had our base already. They came back to us. And our fight 

with Wola We reszczynska we went into the woods. And I don't think some body was 

killed. I know one airplane was shot down. I know a few Germans were killed right what 

I saw in the, in the fight because we went into the woods and he was standing there. 

There was a very big flash was in front of me . I was behind a, a tree, a big one, and there

was some  water there in the front of this. All of sudden, a splash there in front of this. 
Artillery hit there, and it didn't, it didn't explode. And then Baranovskiy was not too far. I 

said to him, "Look here, I almost got killed.ﬂ He said, "Jews don't get killed. You are a 

Jew." Just like that. He made a joke.  
 

Q: So you went through scot-free?   

 

A: I went through scot-free. After this, it took a 
few days, a few days after, the Russians start 
comi ng. Started comi ng. It was the worst part in our life cause the Germans were all over 

because they came from the front. And there was tanks and the small vehicles and all 

over the field all over. We didn't have where to hide. We didn't have where to hide. It's 

impossible. Then I don't know, we had no choice. It was some  kind of a wooden area, 

small woods, small woods and we went into this. Lucky we didn't go into the fields 

because they went through the fields. The Germans went through the fields. And we 

were, were there in this, and we laid down still sitting there. I remember one of the 

wome n got up and she had a red, and red this Œ a handkerchief or something like that she 

ripped it off her head and I pushed her down. And we were laid down, that the Germans 

came with airplanes with all this, we were laying there. Somehow, they had their mi nds 

with some thing else, and they went through us.  
 

03:59:26   

 

Q: With one mi nute left, I want you to tell us how the Russians came in and actually 
liberated your area.  
 

A: The Russians came in, and we were like an organized group, it came in a Pollack with a 
beard Œ he looked like Messiah. He came over to us, he said, ﬁWhat are you doing here in 

the woods?  You know the Russians are here in this village. Right next to you, in this 

village the Russians are here.ﬂ Said, ﬁWhat?ﬂ  Said, ﬁCome with me.ﬂ And we start 

walking with Œ ma rching a group, like soldiers, you know. We  going Œ we™re proud. All 

of a sudden the Russians start shooting. The Russians, on us! Because they knew Œ didn™t 

know who this is. They thought it™s Germans. A column of people going? !?  And we laid 

down and we sent out two or three guys with white Œ this handkerchiefs and all this. And 

they went over to them and they told them it is a group of partisans and this, and they 

said, ﬁJews on top of this, what? ﬂ  Here this Œ a Russian general came over, a Jew. And 

then another officer, a Jew. There™s a lot of Jewish officers there, between the Russians. 

And they were happy to see us, and they hugged us. And they said, ﬁBut we have no 

time. We are at war to go. There is a place, there, not too far, what the SS staying and we 

have a big fight with them. You stay here and then you Œ we took over Lublin already. 

We  took over Lubartów and all other towns are taken over already from us. And you go 

back and you are free.ﬂ And this free was, was very, very sad, very sad. Then we start 

feeling how alone we are. Everybody star
t looking for family. Everybody start looking 
for, for  somebody to, to, to share his problems, share this. I couldn™t Œ with my family I 

was cut off, I didn™t know what happen there. Then it takes Œ took time a little bit, they 

start comi ng fr om the other side, they told me that my family was killed, all of them in 

one day, they took them out, they killed everybody. My brother was killed in a, in a

camp. And everybody, what rema ined there, from, from millions of millions of people, 
remained 150,000 people remained in Poland. Why I know, because after this I organized 

registration and I was working with Dr. Sommerstein
43
. Maybe you heard about him?  He 
was a big leader for the war, he our leader from Œ in war for the area government and I 

was working with him, yes. I had a very big job in Poland too, they gave me  a job right 

away, and I registering all the Jews, everybody what lived through, came to me and they 

registered their child and this. And I found what is going on, how ma ny people and where 

they livedŠ
