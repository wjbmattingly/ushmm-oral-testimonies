good -- the teacher was very intelligent. She sa

So, it was all right. Very 
soon I had five friends. 
Q: And how old were you? 

A: I was six. We  -- school starts first grade. I

forbidden, you know?  We knew everything. 

Q: You knew that there were -- 

A: Crematorium. We knew everything, because
 the British, the Eng
lish [indecipherabl e] you 
know, told. But it was very dangerous to listen to
 it, yeah. We listen in the mi ddle of the night. 

Q: Did you some how rema in hopefu
l that your mother mi ght ma ke it out of there alive? 
A: Of course.  

Q: Did you have a lot of hope from day to day in general?  Optimis m?  

A: I -- I was -- my whol e life I was a big optimist. 

Q: Why do you think that™s the ca
se?  Why were you an optimist? 
A: That™s my nature.  

Q: So even as things got worse around you -- 
A: I always had hope.

Q: Now, what happens before -- what happene
d to cause your husband and you to decide to go 
into hiding?  Tell me  about
 that -- that phase.  
A: Well, at that time, there came -- we were notifie
d to come  with a suitcase not heavier than so 
and so much kilogram, a nd with white ink, na
me  written on the top, there and there, for 
relocation. So we knew already wh
at happened, and we were eni 
-- we were denying it. We  did 
have a place already, we knew already where to go. 

Q: When did you make arrang
ements for such a place? 
A: My husband ma de it. 

Q: And did that -- did he do that pr
etty early on after the anschl uss?  
A: Aft -- no, after we heard that people were deported.  

Q: And -- 

A: It was a laundry. 

Q: This is where you went into hiding? 

A: Into hiding, yeah. It was a laundry in the 13
th
 district, in [indeciphe
rabl e]. And there were 
went. 

Q: And how did you or your 
husband know these people? 

A: Can™t tell you. I don™t reme mber. 

Q: And who were they? What are 
their name s, and who were they? 
A: Their name  was Pukas. She was not ma rried, 
and they were hand laundries, you know. Yeah. 

I don™t know how we me t the m, yeah. 

Q: So tell me  about when you first moved into th
is hiding place, the transition from leaving your 
home , and what did you bring with you? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0503  
17 
 
 
A: We  went every day, we took a little bit out, y
ou know, fr om the apartment. Clothes first, like I 
would go to the cleaners, and then we started to 
take other things out, lik
e silver, and so forth. 
Q: I™m going to take a quick break. Okay, we were
 starting to talk abou
t you beginning to go into 
hiding, and I wanted to ma ke sure I understood 
approxima tely when was this?  How long after 
the anschluss?  Wa s it a year or 
two after, or -- or sooner than
 that?  Do you -- did you go into 
hiding in 1938, or was it later? 
A: Later, later.  

Q: Think it ma y have be en closer
 to 1941, does that seem right? 
A: I thinks that would be 1941, yeah. 

Q: So, from 1938 to 1941, were things getti
ng more and more difficult all the time? 
A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  

Q: And are there any examples that come  to mi nd
?  What -- what sorts of things were happening? 
A: Life became  very complicated for us, 
you know?  Everybody know when you went to the 
street, you are a Jew, you know?  And it was -- and 
we lost all our apartments, I told you that 
already. We  pushed together in sma
ll rooms. It was complicated, yeah. 
Q: We re you actively trying 
to leave the country? 
A: Oh yeah. I was supposed to go to Venezuela, I told you that. 

Q: But after that didn™t work
 out, did you try other things? 
A: Then you couldn™t go. We  waited for papers 
who never came . You co
uld leave if you have 
the papers, but it never came .  

Q: And then at some  point you started l
ooking into the option of
 going into hiding. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: And your husband was mostly in charge
 of looking for those arrangeme nts? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0503  
18 
 
 
A: Yeah, yeah.  
Q: Now, you already told me  a 
little bit about receiving some ki
nd of order, a relocation order. 
What did that say?  What was the 
relocation order that you received?   
A: I didn™t receive it. They star
ted to -- people started to receiv
e it. [indecipherabl e] my mother 
too, I told you, to come  with so
 and so much for relocation, and 
they went to Theresienstadt. 
From there they came later to Auschwitz.  

Q: I thought you said you and your husba
nd also received a relocation order. 
A: Then we went in hiding. 

Q: So when you received your -- the relocation or
der, what did it say? How long did it give you 
in order to relocate? Was it 
very short period of time ?  
A: I don™t reme mber. 

Q: I guess what I™m curious to know is, di
d you have to go into hiding very quickly? 
A: I think so. But we already knew, 
and we were prepared to do it.  
Q: So does that mean you moved out of your apartment entirely? 

A: Yeah. We left, yeah.  

Q: So the first place you went into hiding in 
1941, can you give a physical sort of description, 
whatever your me mory c a n recall. 

A: There™s some thing. Wait a second. Yea
h, Debbie™s little brother, was his 13
th
 birthday. 
Debbie?  

A2: Yes?  One second. 

A: Your little brother, wh
at was his name ?  Ignatz. 
Q: Oh, I think -- 

A2: Who, Ignatz? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0503  
19 
 
 
Q: I think yeah, you me a n -- 
A2: Ignatz. 

Q: -- her mother™s brother. We ll, actually 
-- so I want to -- I want to just -- 
A: No, not her mother™s brother.
 Debbie™s little brother. Debbie? 
A2: Yes? 

A: You had a little brother. 

A2: I have a -- my brother is Howard. 

Q: Ah yeah, that™s right. Her mother™s brother, 
yeah. I-Igna tz. He was 13, and I said on that day, 

you know, family should be together, so the gra
ndparents they were in hiding already, and we 
arranged they should come  late in the evening while everybody goes home, and we will have a 

little celebration. And they never came, becau
se they were arrested in the morning. 
Q: I think actually we -- we ha
ven™t talked about this yet dur
ing the interview. Maybe you can 
explain wh-who are these fa mily me mbers, or w
ho are these friends you ar
e referring to. Can you 

tell me a little bit about y
our friends Ann and Ignatz? 
A: My friend Ann? 

Q: How did you meet them, or how l ong did you know them?  

A: We ll, when I saw her first, she wa
s 13 -- Ann Green?  You speak about her? 
Q: Yes, because you started to talk about her br
ot her, so I just wanted you to give a little 
introduction to both of them. 

A: So when I saw her the first time, she was 13, 
and her father was what we call a person -- they 
came from a small town to Vienna, they were re
located, and he could do 
everything. You want to 
sell, he  knew who buys. You want to buy, he knew who will sell. So what we needed was 

money, and he knew some body who would borrow mone
y for a lot of interest. We  couldn™t get 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0503  
20 
 
 
our money from some  re ason or the other. And th
ere I me t Annie the first time, Ann Green. And 
his -- her little brother, yeah. 
Q: So when you first went into hiding with 
your husband, were you also 
in hiding with Ann and 
her brother? 

A: No. Whe n I went to hiding -- I wonder if her 
brother went with us, I 
wish I could reme mber. 
Q: It™s okay. Can you -- 

A: The 19
th
 of May. 
Q: What was the 19
th
 of May? 
A: Was his -- her 
brother™s birthday.  
Q: And wha t  happened on that day? 

A: I wanted a -- we should be all together, but 
her parent s never came because they were arrested 

in the morning. 

Q: And did you know that?  Did everybody know that? 

A: No, no, we did not know. They didn™t show u
p. So later in the even
ing, some body called, and 
said they are arrest ed. 

Q: And how did you deal with this news? 

A: Beg your pardon? 

Q: How did you cope?  How did you deal with this news? 

A: Well, was very hard. Her brot
her started to yell, and to cry.
 And I said, please be quiet, 
some body would -- could hear us. And Annie went 
to -- Ann Green, she went to calm hi m down. 
Was very bad. It was very bad. 
Q: And this is when -- his birthday, Ignatz™s bi
rthday, May 19, that™s -- 
at that time you were all 
in hiding together? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0503

with us. Annie came later. Mrs. Green, she was some place else, she came later. 

Q: Tell me about the conditions of this hiding pl ac

bit of space? What we
re the conditions like? 

A: It™s -- was a [indecipherable] laundry, and th
ey had a wooden, little ho
use. Was s mall, but it 
has electricity. It was a outhouse, you know, no to
ilet in the house. But 
it wa s all right, we 
ma naged. We were hiding it. We  did f

secure, you know?   
Q: How ma ny of you were in that outhouse? 

A: Outhouse, no, not outhouse. 

Q: In -- in the outhouse, you said. 

A: Outhouse was the toilet. 

Q: Sorry, in this little building, right? 

A: In the building. So who was there? My husban

were four. 

Q: We re you all sleeping in one room?  

A: I don™t think so. Could be, I don™t reme mber. 

Q: And whe r e did you go to the bathroom, it was close by? 

A: It was outside in the gard

outdoors.  

A: That was the outhouse. The toilet was 
outside, a little shed where you had to go.

Q: And wha t  did you do for food back there? 
A: For food, well you had to get it. And we bought
 it. We  had to take -- we knew some body, she  
could get everything. But if you needed sugar, yo
u had to take some  chickens, otherwise she 
didn™t give it to you. She was very funny. She always said, I™m very good to you, am I?  But she 

never woulds give us anything, 
[indecipherable] anything if you 
wouldn™t have taken something 
else what you did not need. But she c
ould get everything from the ma rke t .  
Q: And was this woma n Jewish, or not Jewish? 

A: No, not Jewish. 

Q: So she was helping you, she 
knew that you were in hiding? 
A: Yeah, yeah, she knew. 

Q: We re there a number of non-Jewish people helping you? 

A: Yeah, there were two girls, they had -- they
 had some  land and they grow vegetable, th -- 
everything. We got everything from them. And t hey
 knew. They didn't say it, but they knew.  
Q: They knew that you were in hiding? 

A: Yeah, I know. One of this -- one name  wa

name  I don™t reme mber. They knew, because they did give us everythi ng. Before they go to -- 

went with their vegetable to the ma rket to sell, we  got it.  

Q: So, you were able to get food. Do you reme

you had enough food? 

A: No, no, enough food. 

Q: And did you have a kitchen, did you cook? 
A: No, I didn't cook. Pukas, she cooked.  
Q: And tell me  a little bit about her, the person who was keeping you in hiding.

A: Yeah, well, she had a boyfriend who was a carpe
nter. And he started -- 
and sh-she must have 
told him, because he st arted to ask money. He -- 
he started to stick -- tell my husband that he 
needs mone y to buy wood, you know?  Yeah, he 
started to ask money for  th -- us.  
Q: So what did you do? 
A: We ll, we did give it to him, but he neve
r stopped, and it was a lot of money, you know, for 

Jewish people. He got the money for us if he 
will denounce us. And some how he -- he must have 
done it.  

Q: He must have done what? 

A: To denounce us. To tell 
that we are there.  
Q: You think he™s the reason you were found? 

A: Yeah. I think so. 

Q: But the -- but the woma n was very good to you? 

A: Yeah, we were -- but he did -- we had to fr
om time to time to other place, which we did, you 
know?  And then she -- they called us back, a
nd we came ba ck, let™s se
e, around five o™clock, 
when everybody was in the street going home fr om
 work. Was five o™cloc
k in the evening. Four 
o™clock in the morning the Gesta
po came , and we were arrested.  
Q: Now, before I ask you about -- about that time, 
I just want to try to capture more details while 
you were actually still in hiding. Why -- why did 
you leave -- is her name  Pukas -- Pukas?  Why 
did you leave, from time  to tim
e, from her hiding place? 
A: We  had to, yeah. That was the arrangeme nt.  

Q: She told you you would need to leave? 
A: That was the arrangeme nt from the beginning. 
Q: So where else did you go when you would leave? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0503

A: To some body -- people -- this was a couple, they 
were living in a completely different district, 
we didn™t know them. He was a tiny little ma n, 
[indecipherable] was his name , ma rried to a 
Jewish lady, and they took us in. We  went to them.  

Q: Did you go to other hi ding places as well? 

A: No, only those two. 

Q: Only those two, so this -- this

A: Yeah.

A: Yeah -- no, no, at the woman place. 

Q: Did you do any work while you were staying with her? 

A: Yeah, ironing. Oh yeah.  

Q: Now, tell me  how you were feeling?  Every 
day were you worried and afraid, or what was 
your feeling at the time? 

A: We  were always worried, but we had the 
children and we had 
school. They didn™t know 
anything. They couldn™t read, they couldn™t write, 
they had no schooling at all. Every afternoon -
- no, every evening -- in the af
ternoon we ironed, and in the evening we had school. They 
learned to wr ite, to read, whatever we could ba 
-- husband was very highly 
educated, and he is -- 
whatever we could, you know?  We  taught them, of course. 

Q: You™re talking about the tw
o children who were with you. 
A: Yeah, yeah. About Mrs. Green, and her little brother, yeah. 

Q: And how old were they?  We ll, he was 13 you said, and she was -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0503  
25 
 
 
A: And she was -- she is 15 years, she was born 1925. She was 15 years younger than I. 
Q: So every night you became a teacher? 

A: Yeah.  

Q: So do you feel like during this time in hiding, we
re there also time s where things were not as, 
you know, heavy and worrisome ?  Did you have any lighter mome nts? 

A: No. We  were worried all the time. You know
, you -- you are not worried all the time, that™s 
impossible. You forget yourself. But w-we were 
not really peaceful, no. We were hopeful. That™s 
different. And we always ma de it, you know.  

Q: We re there any humorous stor
ies while you were in hiding? 
A: Oh yeah. Two, yeah, yeah. 

Q: Can you tell me  about those? 

A: We ll, you know, when she wanted some thing, Puka
s, we have to give it to her. She did not 
stop. So it wa s a holy day and she wanted a goose. 
And finally we got the goose, but we had to 
pick it up by the [indecipherable] station. There 
wa s a stand for papers and cigarettes, and she 
had the goose. And we had to go there, was very
 dangerous. Debbie™s moth
er and I, we went 
there, a-and there was the goose,
 I had the canvas bag, and the goose went in that canvas bag, 
and there were Gestapo and gendarmes, but we fi
nally ma de it, and we left . And there was a dog 
[indecipherable] after that, he smelled the blood in
 that canvas bag, and we were running to the 
streetcar, and we finally ma de it. You know, we 
were so afraid of that dog, that some body will 
notice it. That was very funny. Whe n we came 
home, and Annie got undressed, she had a blue 
sweater. Her skin was all blue. Wa s not -- at 
that time , nothing was colorfast, like today. 
Q: At the time now you™re -- you™
re laughing about it, but were you 
very worried at that time ?  
A: Sure, I was worried.

Or she was a girl and you were a young woma n. 
A: Yeah, yeah, she was a girl, yeah. 

Q: Just the two of you out on the streets? 

A: Yeah.  

Q: How ofte n did you go out like that? 

A: Oh, we went out when we had to do, yeah.  

Q: We re you worried -- were you wearing th
e Jewish Star of David at that time? 
A: No. Oh God. 

Q: So you were trying to pass as non-Jewish? 

A: Sure.  

Q: Did anyone ever talk to you 
and say anything to you, and indi
cate that they thought you were 
Jewish?  

A: No. I knew that -- that one for the -- for the tw
o girls, Fi shbach, who -- who hads the -- that 
garden that he had all that vege
table, and so she knew. She never 
said anything, but I am sure she 
knew. 

Q: Wa s there anything about your appearance thatma de it easier for you to pass in the streets as 

non-Jewish? 

A: Yeah, I-I didn™t look like Jewi
sh. I was blonde, I have -- my hair was golden blonde, it was 
very light. No, I didn™t look like Jewish, no.

Beginning Ta pe Two Side A 
Q: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial
 Museum interview with Marianne Wi ndholm, 
conducted by Amy Rubi n on Nove mber 18, 2005, in 
Manhattan, New York. This is tape number 
two, side A. Okay, I™m going to continue asking 
you a little more aboutyour time in hiding. And 
I™m wondering, during this entire time , I have the 
impression that you first went into hiding in 
1941? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: And -- and you were s -- you stayed in hiding until 1944. So a lot was ha ppening during this 

time, and I™m wondering what did you know 
about the war, and what was going on. 
A: We  knew everything. We listened to the British
 sender at night, I told you. We  do -- we knew 
that attentat which, you know, there was supposed 
to be attentat of 
Hitler? You know that? 
Q: Say that again?  There was supposed to be? 

A: Yeah, attentat? He was supposed to be killed. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And that -- some how we knew that will ha ppen, but it di d not.  

Q: So while -- I -- I knew that 
you were listening to the radio be
fore you went into hiding, but 
even while you were in hi ding, you still listened? 

A: Yeah.  

Q: And was that -- you listened ri
ght in that little building? 
A: Yeah. We had the radio, yeah.  

Q: So what were your conversations mostly ab
out while you were in hiding?  Did you talk 
primarily about the war?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0503  
29 
 
 
A: That I should reme mber. Of course. We  spoke 
about the war, we spoke about what happened, 
how we did live. We  spoke about what will happ
en. Then we had the children, who didn™t learn 
anything, so we had school every day. 
Q: Did you feel like you were beco
ming a -- a sort of mother to 
these children?  You were taking 
care of them. 

A: We ll, I f -- I did feel very near to th
em. They boy was very young, you know, of c ourse, and 

Annie was 15 years younger than I, so -- so Annie, 
I were more a friend than a mother. But to her 
little brother, I did feel like a mother, yeah. 

Q: Did you ever talk about sort of strategies 
about how you were trying to survive this entire 

time?  You know, walking out on the streets, di
d you have strategies where you would go, how 
you would walk? 

A: I only noticed one thing. Wh
en I was liberated by the Russi
ans, you know that -- you know I 
was liberated by the Russians?  

Q: Right. 

A: That I c --  noticed that  I was afraid to go 
on the walk part . I was going on the street, til I said 
to myself, are you crazy, you™re free. You know?  

Q: Are you saying you didn™t want
 to walk on the sidewalk? 
A: Yeah, I was afraid, like I™m not allowed to. 

Q: Because that™s how it was in Vienna? 

A: That how I did feel.  

Q: So as you walked around Vienna, when you would 
come  out of hiding from time to time, how 
did the city feel to you? What were
 the differences?  How did it change? 
A: I didn™t feel -- I wasn™t tired of bei
ng in Vienna. I was in Kr aków, in Poland. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0503  
30 
 
 
Q: No, I™m t a lking about while you were in hidi
ng. Weren™t you s -- in Vi enna the entire time? 
A: Yeah, I was in -- always
 inside [indecipherable] 
Q: So how did the city change during those war y
ears?  Did it feel like a 
different city to you? 
A: No. In later years, when I was living in Ital
y, and I came back to Vienna, everything looked to 
me  so dirty, so broken down. That was later on.  
Q: We ll, what about air raids during the 
war?  Did you experien
ce those in Vienna? 
A: When the air raid we -- well, when we were
 hiding by those people [indecipherable] when the 
air raid came, everybody had to go to the baseme
nt. And their apartment was in the fifth floor, 
and we went up to the attic to hide. And there, 
Bushie, he was afraid of
 the little mi ce. Oh God, 
he -- yeah, we did hid in the at
tic til the air raid was over.  
Q: And you™re saying there were mi ce in the attic? 

A: Yeah, there were mi ce, yeah. And Bushie was so afraid of them, terrible. 

Q: We re you afraid too? 

A: No. Of little mi ce? I don™t want them in my apartment. 

Q: Now, I think I heard another story, and I™m not
 sure exactly the details, but some thing about a 
ma n and the bathtub, the water in the bathtub. Is
 that a story that you reme mber while you were 
in hiding? I think it was 
a ma n who drank the wa ter. 
A: That™s not me. 

Q: Okay, I -- I guess I misunderstood some thing I 
think Deborah was telling me , but maybe I just 
got it wrong. So that doesn™t sound fa miliar to you? 

A: Absolutely not. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0503  
31 
 
 
Q: Did you have any other people who came and jo
ined you during hiding, or was only the four 
of you at all times? 
A: Only the four of us.  

Q: And did you feel like you always trusted 
this woma n who was keeping you in hiding? 
A: Yeah. Only her boyfriend, he needed money, hestarted to ask money. We were afraid of him. 

And that what -- how it happened.  

Q: So while you were working in this laundry, di
d you have to ma ke sure that nobody else would 
see you?  How difficult was that?  People in th
e neighborhood, were you worried about that? 
A: There were next to us, thi --
 there were -- this was a cottag
e, you know, and there were private 
houses. And there were people we knew. I don™t know
 if they had the -- maybe they had some  
idea, but there was no danger.  

Q: Tell me  a little bit about your trai
ning to become  a nurse, I believe. 
A: Yeah. There was a doctor, Dr. Richard Miller. 
I was already liberated then, and he trained me , 
because that Roosevelt Hospital in Vienna was 
not a hospital, it was a orphanlager. There were 

people living -- children without parents, pare
nts without children, the [indecipherable] was 
bumped, and he trained me . Dr. Otto Vulca
n, he trained me , to become  a nurse, yeah. 
Q: So this is -- this is much later, this is after the end of the war? 

A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: Now, while you™re in hiding, 
what were some  of the dream
s or hopes?  What were you hoping 
would happen, that you would 
still leave the country? 
A: Beg your pardon? 
Q: What were you dreaming coul
d happen or would happen, th
at you could still leave the 
country?

A: I don™t think I wanted
 to leave the country. I wa nted to be free. 
Q: So while you were in hiding, were there any 
other -- did you just th
ink you would stay in 
hiding the entire time of the war?  
Was that your strategy and your hope? 
A: My hope was yeah, that it will not take a long time. 
Q: Now tell me  about the day when -- when they came and found you where you were in hiding. 

What -- what exactly happened? 

A: We were away -- you know, I told you, from time 
to ti me  we had to go away to stay with 
other people. They called us we should come  b
ack. We  came back around five o™clock in the 
evening, when everybody was in the street. At f
our o™clock in the morning the Gestapo came, 
and we were arrested. 

Q: Do you have any idea about who -- who 
told the Gestapo that you were there? 
A: I think her boyfriend, who always ask for money. 

Q: And you think this wo ma n 
agreed to let him do that? 

A: I don™t think she knew. 

Q: So, as much as you can reme mbe r  the detail
s, what exactly happened when you got arrested? 
A: Well, we went to jail. And there was alrea
dy a lot of wome n who waite
d to be tr-transported 
to Auschwitz, but they were in quarantine. Ther
e was some  sickness. So Mrs. Green and I, we 
were outside, and we did work. We
 cleaned the floors. Then the 
-- they did give us bread. We  
had to distribute that bread betw
een people. And we did work ther
e, and we were living in the 
open place. 

Q: Now whe r e was that? 
A: It was [indecipherable]
 in jail, in Vienna. 
Q: But you said you were living in an open pl
ace, but you were in jail the whole time? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0503  
33 
 
 
A: We  were in jail, but we  were not locked 
up. We could go out. Not out on the street. You 
know, the people are locked in, we were not lo
cked in. We  could move around on the floor.  
Q: And wha t  were you thinking during this time  period? 
A: We ll, I was very unhappy that they caught us. 

Q: Did you know what would happen next? 

A: Oh yeah. I knew. We  knew.  

Q: You knew specifically that you w
ould be sent to Auschwitz?  Or
 perhaps to some where else?   
A: No, we -- to a concentration camp, I did not
 know Auschwitz. To a 
concentration camp.  
Q: So while you were in jail, you felt there wa
s nothing you could do about
 it, you just had to 
wait?  

A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: When we re you arrested, do 
you reme mber?  It™s 1944, I think. 
A: Yeah. The war was almost over.  

Q: So what happened next when you -- when you we
re then deported? Tell me  as ma ny of the 
details as you can reme mber. 

A: We  were a small transport, not a very big 
one. There was my husband, I, Bushie, Mrs. Green, 
Olga [indecipherable]. Wait a second. Two, four, si
x. Let me  think again, [indecipherable] Olga 
[indecipherable], her husband Otto, and I, Annie,
 Bushie. We  were seven people, who were 
arrested. And we were in jail in Vi enna til we went that transport. 

Q: What do you reme mb er about the day wh
en you were deported from the jail? 
A: Well, it --  there was still --  was a Jewish
 community, and they did bring us, I reme mber 
everybody did get a little bread in the [indeci
pherable]. They came to the [indecipherable] 
station, and did give everybody a little
 bread in the [indecipherable].

Q: As you were leaving on the transport? 
A: Yeah.  

Q: Was it a diffi cult journey? 

A: It was not difficult, 
it was just fr ightened.  
Q: Did you have any idea what direction 
you were heading in?  Where you were going? 

A: No. I know we are going to a concentration camp.  

Q: But you got on the train and 
you didn™t know where, exactly. 
A: No, no. We went to Birkenau. Auschwitz 
was for me n, and Birkenau was for wome n.  
Q: And whe n did you know that you were going ther
e?  Only when you arrive
d, or right before?   
A: We ll, we knew we go to a concentration camp. 

Q: So how long did the tr
ip take, the transport? 
A: We  had to change trains and all that. 
Did take a very long time. Hours, ma ybe.  
Q: We re you uncomfortable on 
that ride, or just -- 
A: Frightened, yeah. 

Q: Just frightened. And what were your 
first impressions upon 
arriving to Auschwitz? 
A: We ll, there was Mengele sitting, and then th
ey ma de selections. My husband went here, I 
went there. And I said I want
 to go with my hus band, and he said to me , be happy you™re not 
going. And my husband, his color in his face became gray. He knew. And I think I only touched 

his hand, I don™t reme mber. He knew, yeah.  

Q: That™s the last time you saw him?  

A: Yeah.  
Q: And whe n did you learn what -- what actua
lly happened, or did you not even learn anything 
about him?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0503  
35 
 
 
A: I knew. When we were separated, I knew, yeah.  
Q: How wer e  you able to -- to go on after that? 

A: We ll, if you in a concentrati
on camp, you learn everything. You l
earn to survive. You learn to 
steal, you know?  You tried everything to stay
 alive. You saw some thing, and you looked around, 
there was nobody around you, you took it, yeah. In th
e morning, six o™clock, I run to the kitchen, 
ma ybe I could find some  potato peels. There were none, but they took already breakfast for the 

different -- I was in block 13. So there was alwa
ys four girls who carried -- we had in the 
morning, some thing sweet, farina or so. So 
they carried that, and have pass by, as 
[indecipherable] the end, and I -- 
I took some  out . They couldn™t 
help it. I had two breakfasts. 
Yo-You tried everything. You never knew, should you eat your bread? Should you keep a piece 

for the morning, they will steal it. And we wo
rked very hard. Look on my  hand. That was one SS 
woma n did to me . She did hold her foot, when we 
went one, two, three, four and I fell, and she 
stepped on my hand. 

Q: What happened, you were tryi ng to reach for some  food?  

A: Beg your pardon? 

Q: What happened again?  You were
 trying to reach for some  food?
 What happened with this SS 
woma n?  You were trying to get some  food? 

A: No, we had to ma rch, one, two, three, four, and 
she put her foot in front of me , and I fell, and 

broke my nose, and she stepped on my hand. Then
 I had to go to the [indecipherable]. Was 
infected terrible.  

Q: How was  your physical health during that whole time  in Auschwitz? 
A: We ll, I only now, when we were liberate
d, they called me  musselman. Musselman me ans you 
are skin and bones. I had 92 
pounds when I was liberated.

Q: How long were you in Auschwitz?  When did you arrive there? 
A: It was eight months.  

Q: Can you tell me  a little more whe n you first 
arrived, what kind of pr
ocess did they put you, 
and -- and who else were you still with?  We re you with Ann and Ignatz? 

A: No. Whe n we arrived we 
were s-separated. Men went to
 Auschwitz, wome n went to 
Birkenau. 

Q: So did you stay with Ann, your friend? 

A: Yeah.  

Q: And do you reme mbe r , did you go through the shower
s?  What -- what sort of process did they 
put all of you through? 

A: Well, first they cut 
our hair. They didn™t shave us. They 
cut it very short. I had long, blonde 
hair, they cut it. Then they ta
ttooed us, you know that. And then we went to the shower, took all 
our clothes, and I had very good shoes, platform
 shoes. There was a ma n, one of the prisoners, 
we have to give everything to him. I said to 
him, you are from Vienna, I knew him. Let me  keep 
my shoes. And he told me , [indecipherab
le] you know what means [indecipherable]  
Q: No. 

A: You say [indecipherable] if some body dies, bu
t not if a huma n being dies, you know?  If a 
animal dies, [indecipherable], you aren™t a -- 
you [indecipherable]. Then I knew where I am. I 
knew him, but when he said that to me , then I know. Oh yeah.  

Q: You me a n, you knew how difficu
lt things would be there? 
A: Oh yeah. Then I knew, yeah.  
Q: Because this was someone you knew and he
 wouldn™t even let you keep your shoes? 
A: Sure.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0503  
37 
 
 
Q: And he was -- he was one of the 
Jewish prisoners,
 is that  right? 
A: Yeah, sure.  
Q: Did you see a lot of Jewish prisoners be
ing very mean to other Jewish prisoners? 
A: I can™t tell you that. Everybody tried very hard. 
Next to us was a Polish block, there were all 
Polish girls, and I had no shoes. You know wh
at I had?  Those wooden clogs, like the Holland. 
You know wa -- how they are? 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: So that™s -- I coul dn™t walk in them, I was [i
ndecipherable] like that. One of the Polish girls 
did bring me  a pair of shoes, high up to here
, yeah?  She saw me , and she got packages from 
home , they were mostly politish. They were good.  

Q: So in your -- in your barracks, was it mostly 
other Jewish wome n from Austria, or was it a 
real combination 
of different -- 
A: A combina -- you heard it in 
the evening. The Italia
n™s sung, ma ma  so dante felice. Mother, I 
only will be happy if I will be -- 
if I will be returning to you. Th
e Greeks sung the old song in the 
evening, which I could not understand. It kept them alive, I suppose.  

Q: And they were allowed to sing?  N
obody was keeping them from doing that?   
A: I suppose not.  

Q: So you must have been around a lot of wome
n you couldn™t even speak with because of the 
languages. 

A: Oh yeah.  

Q: We re there other wome n there who 
spoke German?  You could communicate? 
A: I was -- yeah, with Germans, yeah. They 
called me  delonger deutsch, the tall German. 
Q: And were you with your friend Ann in the barracks? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0503  
38 
 
 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Did you still feel like you were taki
ng care of her, looking out for her? 
A: Yeah, yeah. She never wanted to wash, because when we came back from work, you opened, 

no water, drops. I wake up one night, and there were
 two girls [indecipherable] from our barrack, 

which [indecipherable]. So I said, oh God, where 
are they going?  I run after them, and there was 
so much water in the washrooms, flowing, you 
know?  Then I woke up every night, we went 
there, and we washed each other™s back from 
top to bottom. We had no towel to dry, I said it 
doesn™t ma tter. Because if you had the selec
tions, one pimple on your body, you went. We  were 
afraid, you know, of sicknesses. We  were a ve
ry cheap labor force,
 didn™t cost a penny. 
Q: So it sounds like you tried very 
hard to st ay cl ean all the time. 
A: Oh yeah. I knew that if -- if you are clean, you 
had a chance. I told her that, yeah. She had -- 
she showed me  in the panties she got, there was a -- a 
--  a louse. I said to he
r, ﬁListen Annie, if I 
will kill your lice, I will not be able to take care of
 my lice. You will not live if I will not live. So 
you take care of yours, I of mi ne, and just do 
what I tell you, then ma ybe we have a chance.ﬂ 
Q: We re these the kind of conversati
ons you would have almost every day? 
A: No, no, no, no. We  tried very ha
rd. We  worked very hard.  
Q: Wa s there any part of norma l life 
that was able to continue, or not? 
A: Where? 

Q: In Auschwitz.  

A: We worked s-six and a half 
days. Sunday afternoon we were fr

take care of ourself. 
Q: And wha t  did you do during that time ?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0503  
39 
 
 
A: We ll, we washed, we cleaned ourself. 
We  go and look if we find some body you knew from 
home . You s l ept. 
Q: What kind of work were you doing? 

A: Well, first -- that first work I did, st ones like 
that we have to clean, and from one place we did 
bring it to a other pl ace. And there were the 
bloodhounds behind us, we have to run with the 
heavy stones, then we have to take the back. It 
was just some thing to ma ke us tired, nothing else. 
There was n-n-no -- nothing what ha
s any sense. And then I -- then
 we made [indecipherable] to 
clean the paveme nt. And then I di
d some thing, I was standing in 
water, I don™t remember what I 
did. 

Q: You me a n, some  kind of job you had standing in water? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: And were these jobs -- 
End of Tape Two, Side A 
Beginning Ta pe Two, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holoca ust Memorial Museum interview with 

Marianne Windholm. This is tape
 two, side B. Okay, I think th
ere are a couple stories while you 
were in Auschwitz that I™d be in
terested in learning more about. 
I think there™s a story that has 
some thing to do with potatoes. Can you tell me  more about that? 

A: Yeah. What happened is, when we get o -- got 
our soup in the evening, I said to that person 
who did give the soup, why don™t you give me  so
me  soup from the bottom, where there are 
potatoes, a little vegetable, ma ybe a piece of meat
. And she said to me  s-some thing very bad, and 
thens give  me from top a little water, so I thre
w it in her face. So next day was the day when you 
went to work, you got instead one potatoes, two po
tatoes. So he said, you are not going to work, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0503  
40 
 
 
I will show you. So I didn™t go to work. But some body 
has to go to pick up the potatoes. So they 
did send four girls from our block 
to go to pick up the potatoes. 
So we heard potatoes, we went 
to the ba -- big, beautiful potatoe
s, we did [indecipherable] I took the potatoes, one there, one 
there, and here. Four potatoes 
already. And then we came to my block, and we had to put that 
down, had two potatoes, put them under my ma ttr
ess, under the ma ttress from my neighbor, and 
then we stood appelle and then [indecipherable]
 then I have potatoes, and we had so much 
potatoes, we ate and ate and ate. She sa
id I will not get any, so I got ma ybe 10.  
Q: And that was very unusual, right? 
A: Oh God. Oh God. 

Q: Now whe r e did you put these potatoes, sin
ce we™re doing only an a
udio recording, I know 
you showed me  visually, but wher
e did you keep these potatoes? 

A: Two I put in here, two I put in here, inside. 

Q: You™re talking about under your arms, right? 

A: Yeah, inside. 

Q: Inside your blouse 
-- inside your shirt. 
A: Yeah, and then the others
 I put under 
my  ma t t r e s s .  
Q: So were you not as hungry durin
g those days with the potatoes? 
A: No, that was a day where I was very happy, y
eah. I had potatoes not only for me , for my 
friends, too. Who could eat so ma ny potatoes? 

Q: When you were working, were you work
ing side by side with your friend, Ann? 
A: No.  
Q: She was some where else? 
A: She was someplace else. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0503

Q: Now, there™s another story, 
I think, about one of your socks.
 You had some thing special in 
one of your socks? 
A: Yeah, I g -- we got once a month different cl
othes. We  we nt to [indecipherable] we got 
different clothes. And I have two pair of sock
s. The hurt -- one sock hurt me terribly, but I 
couldn™t help it, I had to wear 
it til Sunday, til I™m off, Sunday
 afternoon. Then I open it, and 
there was a golden cross with 
a golden chain. And it says, Luig
i and the name, Italian name, 
August the 26
th
. Now I have to find some body where I c
ould exchange that golden cross for 
food. Finally I did find, was far away, I had to r
un there, I got 20 soups, 20 days I could go for 
soup. But it was very far. Had to r
un like crazy to ma
ke the curfew.  
Q: What was the curfew, what 
time? Was it early, pretty early? 
A: Yeah, it was early, yeah. 

Q: But you would not have gotten in trouble fo
r being out before the curfew and running over 
there, to the other area? 

A: No. The curfew have to be inside. 

Q: And how did you get these 20 soups?  You wo
uld go back to some whe r e in ke -- you got 
soups every day? 

A: Yeah, every day I run there for soup. 

Q: It sounds like you were pretty
 resourceful during this diffi
cult time. Do you feel that you 
were?  

A: Well, I tried. We all tried to survive.  

Q: Do you think being resourceful
 like that you were able to 
eat more and stay stronger? 
A: To eat more? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0503  
42 
 
 
Q: It sounds like you were able to get more 
food at certain times, a
nd ma ybe that kept you 
stronger. 
A: We ll, I only know when I was liberated, I had 90 pounds. 

Q: And how much did you usually we igh? 

A: At that time , 135 - 136. 

Q: So you were extremely weak? 

A: Oh, I was very weak. And they called me  
muss elma n, that™s people [indecipherable] and 
bones, bones and skin. 

Q: Now did you -- did you observe any -- any sort 
of religious observances
 during this time in 
Auschwitz, privately, or 
did you pray at all? 
A: No, no, no, no.  

Q: Did you regard yourself as a religious person? 

A: We ll, if you -- you could feel
 religious without praying, 
I suppose. Don™t you think so? 
Q: Yes, I think so. Did you feel that 
you had a belief in God during this time?  
A: I don™t think that I said God will help. Help yourself. 

Q: Did you ever let your emotions really get to 
you during this time in Auschwitz, or did you just 
try to stay so strong emotionally? 

A: That™s what I tried, yeah. 
It was Yom Kippur , and they sa
id, now you have the holiday, you 
don™t have -- you don™t need any f
ood today, it™s your fast day. Di
dn™t give us anything to eat, 
Yom Kippur .  

Q: But you didn™t have to work that
 day, or did they ma ke you work? 
A: Why not?  Is nothi ng to -- they only didn™t 
give  us any food, because is our fast day. 

Q: But you still had to work? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0503  
43 
 
 
A: Sure.  
Q: Did you have any nightmares during this ti
me ?  Wa s it just every ni
ght, how did you sleep? 
A: I can™t tell you that. I wa
s so tired, I suppose I slept. 
Q: And whe n they did the appelle, 
the roll call, what was that  like? 
A: To stay in appelle. 

Q: We re you scared about bei
ng selected and taken away? 
A: We ll, that was some thing else. This was not 
the roll call, this was the selection. You were 
afraid to have  a pimple on your body, because they
 were afraid of sicknesses. So if you had a 

pimple on your body, then you are dead already. 

Q: Did you see a lot of 
people being selected? 
A: I can™t reme mber that. 

Q: Did you ever witness anything very violent,
 any -- any killings while you were there? 

A: Yeah, one Belgian girl escaped, and they did 
fi nd her, and she was hanged. And we had all to 
stay and watch how she was hanged.  

Q: Did you think a lot about the possibility of 
death during this time, 
or did you try to avoid 
those thoughts? 

A: I beg your pardon? 

Q: Did you try to avoid thoughts about 
death, or did you think about death? 
A: No. I tried to survive. I 
didn™t think about death, no. Only 
that water you know, when we 
came from work, they said not to drink, dysentery
 of the water, you know, in the washrooms. So 
I said to my self, I will die anyway, why should 
I die hungry?  I will have -- at least I will have 
some thing to drink. I drank the water, nothing 
happened to me, I didn™t get dysentery, nothing. 
So I came fr om work and I drank.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0503  
44 
 
 
Q: Did others do that as well, 
or were you one of the only ones? 
A: I can™t tell you that. I know I did it.  
Q: Did you ever get seriously ill during this time? 

A: Ill? 

Q: Any kind of sickness? 

A: I had a infection in my right leg, but that 
was already [indecipherable] related. Must have 
been. I was in the revere. I was in the revere area
, and there was rain. I wa
s thinking it is raining, 
and I opened my eyes, and there is o -- the Russ
ian. There wa s a Russian soldier holding me , and 
the rain were the tears from the -- his eyes. He
 was crying. And he did 
give me some vodka, 
whatever. He  tried to bring me  back 
to life. And he cried so terribly. 
Q: That™s at  liber ation?  

A: We  were liberated. They run away, you know. 

Q: We ll, before liberation, while 
you were still in Ausc
hwitz, did you witness or
 at all participate 
in any resi stance activities?  

A: No.  

Q: We re you aware of them going on? 

A: No. 

Q: What about something like there was this 
Sonderkomma ndo uprising in
 October of ™44, did 
you know about that at the time? 

A: Yeah.  

Q: What did you know about that? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0503

A: We knew there was attentat of
 Hitler. And I got a note from Bushie, from Debbie™s uncle. He 
wrote to me  on a piece of paper, I will see you agai
n at the [indecipherable] where my apartment 
was. We  knew about it, yeah. 
Q: Ye -- are you talking about
 Ann™s brother, Ignatz? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: And wha t  happened to him?  

A: We ll, hedidn't ma ke it. 

Q: We re you with Ann the entire 
time while you were at Auschwitz? 
A: No, in the end, Ann went on -- they send her to a other camp. 

Q: While you were at Auschwitz, how much wer e  
you able to learn or he
ar about the war going 
on? 

A: In the end, we heard the bombs fall, and th
e sirens go, then we kne
w some thing is going on.  
Q: But other than that, you real
ly didn™t have any more news? 
A: No. 

Q: Did you ma ke other friends while you were in Auschwitz? 

A: You have to have a friend, otherwise you ge
t crazy. I had a friend, and we exchanged our 
ideas, whatever we knew, poetry, whatever we
 read, you know?  Otherwise you lose your mi nd. 
Q: So even in the mi dst of everything goi
ng on, you are able to read
 things like poetry 
s o me t i me s ?  

A: Not to read. Only -- I had a friend, wh

A: Whenever I was with her. When we were off.  
Q: And which friend is this?  Her name ?  

A: She was -- I forgot her name . 
She came from Czechoslovakia.  
Q: Now, we re you also talking about hopes for th
e future, perhaps even finding fami l y me mbers 
during your time at Auschwitz? 

A: What was that? 

Q: While you were there, were you talking to yo
ur friends, to others, about your hopes for the 
future?  We re you able to try to 
think about the future at all? 
A: Yeah, of cor -- this wa s my only hope.  

Q: Can you tell me  what  happened 
with your sister during the war? 
A: Is -- 

Q: Your brother went 
to Venezuela, right? 
A: Yeah. My sister, I told you, she had the girlfr

because the girlfriend 

said heil Hitler to her,
 she spit in her face. 
Q: But after -- after all of that, 
during the whole war, the rest of
 the war, what -- what happened 
with your sister? 

A: Oh, whe n she was in Yugoslavia, she got ma
rried. And some body told me  after the war, when 
I came back to Vienna, I had to go to the [indeciph
erable] to tell them I am alive. And there I met

A: Yeah, yeah. She was in that detention camp in
 Ferramonti. That is in Italy, all the way down 
on the tip of the toe. And she ma rried there 
some body by name of Jacoba Cohen. And I had no 
idea, of course. 
A2: Tell them how you me t the Pope. 

A: What?  When we were liberated, I had a friend in the concentration camp, and she had a 

daughter, and she was very ill. A
nd her daughter came to me and sa
id, my mother wants to speak 
with you. And she was laying on the floor, and she 
s -- was dying. And she said to me, promise 
me  that you take care of Ilse, of her daughter
, a young girl, she was ma ybe 12 years old, and her 
name was Freedbig. She died, and I 
closed her eyes. I promised I™d take her with me . So she was 
crying all the time. I couldn™t help
 myself. There was a little churc
h, and I said to her, ﬁIlse, I 
take you to the church.ﬂ She was 
Catholic. She never knew she™s Jewish. So I took her there, and 
there was a little priest -- a li
ttle -- a young priest, and s -- he cons
oled her, and he prayed with 
her. He did give her a piece of sugar, and me  
a piece of sugar, and said thank you for bringing 
her. And that was the Pope, later. 

Q: We ll when was this?  When did you go there? 

A: After I was liberated out of 
[indecipherable]. She was crying 
all the time, and I did not know 
what to do with her. She never 
was Jewish. She wa
s born Catholic. 
A2: [indecipherable] her father. 

A: And her father, yeah, she didn™twant her father. Her fa -- wherev

father came, and she didn't  want him. He had a 
short leg. I don™t want him. He was in the camp, 
too. But some thing happened to one of his legs. Sh

you know, don™t worry. I bring her home .

Q: Now, I have just a couple more questions abou
t your time  in Auschwitz. Often I™ve heard that 
-- that survivors reme mber certain smells or noisesthat for the rest of thei
r lives, ther e are certain 
things that are very vivid in this way, and 
I was wondering, have there ever been any certain 
noises or smells that remind you?

A: Can™t tell you that. We called him the angel of death. 

Q: Did you continue to encounter
 him while you were at Auschwitz, or only that one time? 
A: Only that one time.  
Q: So now, the day of liberation, can you tell me
 exactly what happened, and were you expecting 
anything like this? Di
d you know what was about to happen? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0503  
49 
 
 
A: No. We  knew some thing happened, because 
we had -- had the bomb -- bombardment and the 
sirens, yeah. Woke up fr om running, the gates were open, oh yeah. 

Q: So what happened that day?  Ex
actly wh-what was it like for you? 
A: I was very sick. I was in the revere. I had so

very high temperature. But I know there was a gi

looking in. And one of 
our liberated girls came out, threw her off the bike, took the bike and run. Took her bike, yeah. 

Q: This is liberation in --
 in January, right, of 1945. 
A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

A: Some thing, yeah.  

Q: How did the -- how did the Russians treat you? 

A: The Russians?  We ll, they had nothing to eat,
 only potatoes and kraut. And that one doctor 
was a Jew, he spoke Jewish. And I told him, how 
could you give us kraut? 
Potatoes all right, but 
we can™t eat sauerkraut. He said, 
we have a saying, whoever is strong will live, and who is weak 

will die. And then they came and 
wanted to take us to Russia. And then took -- there were three 
sisters, they told me , we are going away, because
 we are afraid of being taken to Russ ia. You 
come  with us?  I said yes.They spoke Polish, and German, and ma ybe Russian, I don™t know. 
And we left. We  went over the Ca

like to ask you a few es -- about a few specific stor
ies, a few anecdotes, and I have a little list 
here, so I™m just going to ask you a few, a
nd then you can tell me what you reme mber about 
these st ories. 

A: Okay. 

Q: One of them is some thing to do with your  father comi ng home  from the war, and I™m

1
, right? 
A: That was World Wa r 
1

Q: We ll, tell me  about that.  

A: We ll, at that time , you know, in the mo
rning, everybody run to ge
t some food, or coal, 
because you couldn™t get anything. So we childre
n were by ourself at home , and we were not 

allowed to open the door to anybody. But we hada little window, with a 
little [indecipherable] 
and some body was ringing the bell, so we went
 up, opened it to look out, there was a ma n. He 

looked like a forester. And he sa
id, ﬁMarianne, open the door, I am your father.ﬂ And I looked at 
him, I said, ﬁI don™t know you.ﬂ But I am your 
fa ther, don™t you know?  Th
en I said to my b-
brother Paul, he is the -- he was 
the oldest, ﬁThere™s a ma n, he says
 he™s our father.ﬂ He  went up, 
he looked at him, we don™t know you. Open th
e door. We di dn™t open the door. We didn™t let 
him in. The n finally my  mother came, and then of
 course, there were only happiness. They were 
dancing and kissing outside, yeah. He™d 
come home from the war, yeah. Dif -- 
Q: How old -- how old were you? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0503  
52 
 
 
A: Oh, I mu st have been
 maybe six,maybe five. 
Q: And did you not recognize your fa ther? 
A: No, no. I didn't see him for years. I didn™t 
recognize him. But my brother recognized him 
because he laughed and he had the golden toot h. 
And my brother saw that golden toot h. And he 
said to me , ﬁIt™s our father.ﬂ How do you know?  He
 has a golden tooth. But he didn™t let him in, 
because Mother did forbid it.  

Q: Now there™s another little anecdote 
I wanted to ask you about, and it -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- something to do with the theater. 

A: With what? 

Q: With thetheater 
--  with the theater . 
A: Theater? 

Q: Yes. 

A: Yeah?  We ll, there was a [indecipherable] comi
ng in from - -  I don™t know from where. It was 
a Jewish theater, and my  parents went and sa
w it. The Golem was the name. And they decided 

that we children are big enough to see it. So -- 
not my sister, my little sister, no. My br other who 
was older than I, and my self and two cousins of 
us. And they took a loge for us children and our 
ma id did bring us there. And we were sitting 
there, and then it started and some body c a me  out 
and said, in Jewish, which were -- 
we  were not used to, we never s
poke it. He said -- I™ll have to 
translate it, so y-you don™t know Jewish, yeah? 

Q: Well, why don™t you say it 
first in Yiddish, and then you can translate it. 
A: Yeah. [speaks Yiddish here] So that means, 
big Jewish king, we are comi ng to tell you and to 
let you know -- and when they started to tell 
you and to let you know, 
we started to laugh 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0503  
53 
 
 
terribly. So next mo me nt they 
took us out one after the other, 
and we had to stay outside, and 
wait til our ma id ca me  to pick us up. When the 
the -- theater was over, th
ey just threw us out. 
Q: They threw you out of the theater? 
A: Of the theater, yeah. One after the 
other. Took us under their arm, out. 
Q: But why, why did they do that? 

A: Because we started laughing.  

Q: So these are some  of the f
ond me mories you have from Vienna? 
A: Yeah. Not only, you know, from c hildhood I 
have other memories, too. Yeah, yeah. 
Q: What about the anecdot
e about Mother™s day? 
A: Oh poor Mother, we didn™t let her 
go out of bed. How do you know about it? 
Q: Well these are some of the stories 
that Mazie encouraged me  to ask you. 
A: Uh-huh. Yeah, well it was Mother™s day, so we  ha -- didn™t have money, we were children, 

but in the -- before Mother™s day, my sister and 
I, we did [indecipherable] and my brother picked 
from the tree, flowers. Lilac. And s -- then 
was Mother™s day and we ma de breakfast, and we 
didn™t let her go out of bed. And sh
e had to go out so urgent, whic
h is normal, but we didn™t let 
her. She had to stay in bed and have breakfast
 which we ma de, in bed. That was the Mother™s 
day story. 

Q: Did she enjoy it? 

A: I don™t think so, she had to go pee.
 Very urgent. We  didn™t let her. 
Q: We ll, it sounds like you had a lot of
 good fun and good memories in your home. 
A: Oh yeah. Yeah, well, I really do, yeah. It wa
s a fo -- but I wa s a orphan at a very young age, 
you know. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0503  
54 
 
 
Q: There™s another story, I be
lieve about your mo ther, a humor ous story, some thing about don™t 
give her away? 
A: Uh-huh, uh-huh. My father passed away, you 
know, and I was in the street. And I was 
walking, and I saw a ma n from the back. He was dr
essed exactly like my father. Blue jacket up 
to here with the fur collar, funny 
little hat. And I starte
d to run, and then I reme mber that he is 
dead. And I stopped and started to 
cry terribly. And a lady came , and said to me , ﬁChi ld, why are 

you crying so much? ﬂ  And I said, ﬁMy father is d
ead, my father is dead,ﬂ and started terrible 
crying. So she said, ﬁOkay, where do you live?  Co
me  on, I™ll take you home .ﬂ She took me  home 
and sh -- then she told my mother she wants me  
to come  to Italy, she was a Italian. She has two 
little boys and they will be very 
happy to have a little sister. And 
my mother could take with me  
there to see if she likes it. If she doesn™t like it
, it™s all right. We have horses, she will learn to 
ride. My boys will be -- adore her. And m- my br
other and my sister  started to yell, ﬁMother, 
please, don™t give her away, don™t give her 
away.ﬂ So that™s th
e story from Italy. 
Q: We re you interested in going? 

A: I can™t tell you that. If I would have gone, or 
if I was interested. I wouldn™t even remember. 
But I reme mber the st o -- like they star ted to ye
ll that they shouldn™t gi ve me -- my mother 

shouldn™t give me  away. Don™t give her away. 

Q: Now, what about another an
ecdote about when your mother 
was sick, and you had to cook? 
A: Oh God. My mother became ill, and had to la
y down. She has a gall bladder attack. And she 
said to me , Marianne, you have to finish -- we
 ate lunch, the big meal
, you know?  Then the water 
cooks, then you put the -- I forgot her -- the -- in
 English, whatever it is in the boiling water. So 
then I took a spoon with water, and I came into he
r bedroom and ask her if that water is cooking. 
I never knew because I never cooked. I ne
ver knew how it looks when water cooks.

Q: How old were you?  Were you very young? 
A: I must have been very young, and I can™t re
me mber where -- where our ma id was, yeah. 
Q: Tell me  a little bit about your ma id, were you close to her? 

A: Very close. We  adored her, we were fa -- we
 were not afraid of our
 parents, oh no, we were 
afraid of her. She was -- oh God. Wh en we came in
 and our shoes were not clean, we got it. She 
had a [indecipherable] she just 
went over our legs, oh yeah. And 
we adored her. And we were 
afraid of her, yeah, but we loved her yeah, yeah. 

Q: What was her name? 

A: Marie. 

Q: And she stayed with you for a long time? 

A: Oh, a very long time. My mother got her when 
she got ma rried. She stayed with us for a very 
long time, and then she met somebody someplace, 
a landowne r, very, ve ry wealthy, and they got 
ma rried. And we spend the summer with her, be
cause she c-came and asked my mother, please 
send the children. And we sp -- did spe
nd the whole summer with them, yeah. 
Q: So your family was pretty well off financially, to have a ma id? 

A: Yeah, in the beginning, sure. As 
long as my father was alive, yeah. 

Q: Now, I believe there™s another story here. 
Maybe you already told me  the one about boiling 
the water, but what about baking the chicken? 

A: Beg your pardon? 

Q: Baking the chicken. Mazie said
 there was a story you wanted to
 share about baking chicken, 
no? 
A: Baking chicken? 
Q: I think when you had to cook for your mother?  You don™t reme mber? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0503  
56 
 
 
A: No. 
Q: Okay. And what about another -- this is the 
final anecdote I wanted to ask you about. Your 

first doll, and your brother did some thing with it. 

A: Yeah, they opened her head. I had had a beautiful doll. Wh en you pushed her belly button, 

she said Mama , and when you laid her down she cl
oses her eyes. And it wa
s a big doll like that. 
And my brother and my cousins couldn't understand 
why she closes her eyes, so they opened her 
head, yeah. And that poor doll, 
she had to go to the hospital. Y
eah, she was very sick. It was 
terrible. 

Q: You took her to the doll hospital? 

A: Not me . Not me , no, my parents,
 my mother and my father, whoe
ver did take her to a place to 
be repaired. They cut the head open.  

Q: We re you very upset, as a child? 

A: I cou -- oh [indecipherable] I cried. Of course
 I was upset. It was a beautiful doll, she would 
s-say Mama . She spoke, yeah. At that time, you know, 
I got it for -- my father did bring it from I 
don™t know where. It was a beautiful, beautiful doll. Had hair, everything, yeah. 

Q: And it was probably unusual to have
 a doll that spoke at that time . 
A: Yeah sure. She only said Mama , but she said
 Mama . But you have to push her belly button. 
Q: We ll, thank you for sharing those stories. Now,
 I want to ask you some more questions that I 
had here, prepared. And I wanted to ma ke sure
 because I -- I don™t remember from our first 

session together, can you just ma ke su
re to tell me  your hus band™s name? 
A: Seno. 
Q: Ah well, I know you were ma rried twice -- 
A: That™s my [indecipherable] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0503  
57 
 
 
Q: -- but your first husband. 
A: Yeah, my first husband was Otto Brower. 

Q: And so that became your last name  for awhile as well? 

A: Yeah, yeah.  

Q: Now, I wanted to return where we left off in
 our interview. We  were talk -- we were starting 
to talk about the time  of
 l i beration at Auschwitz.  
A: Yeah. 

Q: But I wanted to ma ke sure that I had a -- some
 information even before we got to that point. I 

don™t know if you know t his by heart, or if we c
ould some how put this in
 the interview, but do 
you know the -- the registration 
number, the tattoo number 
that they gave to you? 
A: We ll, you know, I -- I know 60 - 65 - 85 A -- I think so. 

Q: Okay, it looks like A7 -- it™s hard
 to read, but ma ybe another two. 
A: 75 -- 72? 

Q: I think it™s 72, and then ma ybe a 25.  

A: 72 - 25. 

Q: Does that sound -- 

A: That sounds -- 

Q: -- familiar? 

A: Yeah.  

Q: So it looks like A7225. 

A: I forgot it, I tell you.  
Q: Is that a good thing, 
to forget the number? 
A: Yeah, I forgot it completely. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0503  
58 
 
 
Q: We ll, thank you for showing me . Now, when
 you were in Auschwitz, did you and others 
around you, did you ever have any kind of religious 
observance?  Did you try 
in any way to -- to 
observe -- 
A: No, no. Only to Yom Kippur, they didn™t give us
 any food. They said that this here the day 

where you fast anyways, you don™t -- so you don™t need any food. 

Q: And that must have been very difficult in
 the conditions you were
 in. Now -- now tell me  
more about liberation. If you can sort of walk
 me through thattime pe
riod, what you reme mber, 
and sort of set up the scene for me
, what -- what exactly happened?   
A: I was sick. I was very sick. I had a me r -- an 
infection in my right le
g, and I have very high 
temperature, and it was very dangerous to go to th
e revere. That revere wa s the s-s-sick station, 
where sick people went, because they made sele
ctions there, you know, and killed pe ople. But I 
had no other choice. I was very, very ill. And it
 happened that I was absent mi nd, I know that. 
And then, I reme mber only that it was raining and I 
did feel the drops from the rain on my face. 
And I opened the eyes, and there 
I saw a ma n with the sickle 
and the hamme r, was a Russian 
soldier. He held me  in his arms, and it wasn™t 
raining, he was crying terr
ibly. That when we -- I 
was -- when we were liberated. And the ga
tes were open, people went out, you know.  
Q: What was the next thing that you did? 

A: Next thing?  I was there for a long time. 
I actually couldn™t go. Then finally I became  well 
enough. And there were three sisters. They s
poke German and Polish and Russian. And they 
saids to that -- no, there came  a rus -- Russian ma n, a
nd they said they will take us to Russia to -- 
to get well again. And there were three sist ers, 
they told me , we are not going with them. You 
want to come with us?  We are going home . They
 were from Seidenberge
n, well a -- this a tar -- 
part of Europe. And so I went with them, and 
we went over the mountains, oh it was terrible. It 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0503  
59 
 
 
was March, was snowing, cold, but
 we went, oh yeah. Took us 
days and days, til we came 
some place, and that was dangerous. We slept on 
the street, like where the -- you know, the -- 
where the bus station is, there was little houses 
where I could stay and wa it for the bus. And 
there a ma n did find us, and he said, ﬁAre you crazy
?  They are looking for Jewish people. If they 
find you, they kill you.ﬂ And he took us to a place where we were safe, yeah. 
Q: How did you travel over thos
e snowy areas, the mountains?   
A: By foot. Later on by coal [indecipherable] the tic
ke ts, were train with co
al, so we were sitting 
on the coal, and went with the train. You c
ould go wherever you want. You didn™t need any 
passport, any nothing at that time.  

Q: First of all, at the time of
 liberation, what was your feeling,
 what were your emotions?  Was it 
hard to believe that this was happening? 

A: Beg your pardon? 

Q: Was it hard to believe that liber ation was 
really happening when it happened?  Wha t  were 
your emotions at the time? 

A: We ll, I was relieved, I would say. I was happy
. And I couldn™t wait to come home, but it took 
a long time , because the war was 
still going on. We were already lib
erated, but the war was still 
going on. There was a time , finally when 
I came  home. Oh God, took a long time. 
Q: Tell me  about the rest of th
e journey, how you got back home . 
A: We ll, you could take a train, you didn™t have 
to pay, you know, I told you that. I was sitting 
for days on the train with coal, that I reme mber. It
 was bitter cold, yeah. 
It was very, very cold. 
And finally, finally, I ca
me home. And when I came home, i t  
was night, and I was on the train, 
and they took us right away, whoever was in the tr
ain, they took us to a pl
ace that was a cellar in 
a building. And there they did give
 us some  to eat or drink. I wa
sn™t by myself, there were ma ybe 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0503  
60 
 
 
with me , 12 or 14 other people. And they did gi
ve us some  tea, not ma de from tea, from 
some thing else. And in the morning the curf
ew was over, and you c -- you could go out. And I 
went out and I did noc -- I did not know where 
I am, where I was. The buildings were bombed. I 
had no idea in which district I am. It was terrible
. But then I went to this Jewish community, and 
there -- everybody has to go th
ere to say, I™m alive. So I went th
ere, and there was a letter from 
some body who said, whoever knows Anna Vietner, that
™s the name , should come  to that and that 
address. 15 district [inde
cipherable], I reme mber like today. I kne
w her, so I went there. And her 
maid was still there, and they had the beautiful 
apartment taken fr om the Nazis. They run away, 
you know?  They left everything. So she had a beau
tiful apartment, and I was home , thanks God, 
I was home. Had a place to stay, and very soon, I 
got the job, I start working, yeah. A displaced 
person camp, the hospital, start working in the ho
spital. I met a doctor in the street, which I 
knew, after the liberation. He said to me , ﬁ W
hat are you doing? ﬂ  I sai
d, ﬁI am doing nothing.ﬂ 
There is nothing. There is not
hing. Like nothing, that doesn™t exist. You come  tomorr ow 
morning to the [indecipherable] hospital. But th
at wasn™t a hospital, was a displaced person 
camp. There were parents without children, childr
en without parents, a
nd they waited to go 
some place. I div -- I start to work with 
him in the [indecipherable] room, yeah.  
Q: Is this in Vienna as well? 

A: That was in Vienna. Th
ere I was home already, yea
h. I was home already, yeah.  
Q: So that was your m -- that was your goal afte
r the war, was to return to Vienna, right? 
A: I had nothi -- no -- nowhere else to go. 

Q: And did you spend -- after you were liberated 
from Auschwitz, did you spend from January til 
the end of the war traveling around? 

A: Yeah.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0503  
61 
 
 
Q: We re you scared during that time period? 
A: I can™t reme mber that. I only know I wanted
 to go home . And of course, you know, you come 
home  and you -- there is nobody. There is nothin
g. You are home , but it™s not home a ny more. 
And then my sister did fi nd me , we had relatives. 
One of our cousins was ma rried to Catholic girl 
that the [indecipherable] relatives
 were living in Vienna, and my 
sister was in Italy. And she did 
write to her, and so she did fi
nd out that I am alive. And it wa
sn™t easy to go over the border. 
There were no passports, there 
were nothing, and the border was 
closed like that. And every 
night I went there, oh God [ind
ecipherable] snow up to here. Ne
ver could cross to Italy. And 
finally, one day, it™s happened th
at I met somebody, a man to whom 
I did give a pair of shoes, 
when we had some , there was -- had also [indeci
pherable] from the conc
entration camp. And he 
was, ﬁ What are you doing here? ﬂ  I said, ﬁI am wa
iting s -- to go to Italy.ﬂ
 So he said to me , 
ﬁDon™t go, I will send you somebody. Don™t be afra
id, you just  try to enjoy, and to get well 
again.ﬂ And he did give me  
money. At that time I was smoki ng a lot of [indecipherable] 
cigarettes. And he said, ﬁSomebody will come  to
 pick you up.ﬂ And one day I came  home , and 
there was a British soldier waiting for me, and he
 was very rude. Where were you? I said, ﬁWhat 
is your business, who are you?ﬂ Break in my room, waiting for me . He told me , ﬁI come  to pick 

you up.ﬂ And I was dressed like a British soldier la
dy. I had the [indecipherable] like that, and I -
- he had papers that I belong to a troop of peoplewho -- who went to entert
ain the troops in Italy. 
That™s how I crossed the border. And then I call
ed my sister, and then 
everything was all right 
again. I was home. 

Q: So you stayed in Italy? 
A: The stay in Italy, yeah, and then 
I went home. I -- I went to Vienna. 
Q: So you were just there for -- for a s
hort time, for a short 
visit, in Italy.

A: Well, I was in Italy for a long time. Later I wa
s living in Rome , I was wi th the American Joint 
Distribution Committee. Do 
you know the organization? 
Q: Sure, what were you doing? 
Q: Well, I was there, I -- I had 
the job there. I went to the 
-- there were the kibbutzims. You 
know what is a kibbutz? 

Q: Yes. 

A: So I went from one kibbutz to the other, 
to teach them hygiene. But you know, there were 
mothers, 14 year old mothers. But mother in
stinct [indecipherable] 
anybody [indecipherable] 
clean, and so the whole vehicle 
was [indecipherable] So I came
 home. It™s a good job, yeah, I 
liked it. And I loved Rome . I loved Rome . And then
 he started, my brother. Everybody is already 
here in the United States, and come  and come
 and come  and come . And I had the rheuma tic 
fever. And the American Joint has to give them 
30,000 dollars that I, when I arrive here, that I 
will not ge t on welfare. Did you hear that? 

Q: Yeah. That™s a lot. 

A: It was a lot of money, yeah. 

Q: Before -- before we go to the time when you 
came to the U.S., tell me a little more. When you 
fi rst returned to Vienna, what was it like to
 talk with or interact with Aust rians? 
A: We ll, of course, I had not my apartment, but 
I was living with friends, I told you that. With -- 
where [indecipherable] was, and I 
went ther e to live with them. 
And then I -- I had nothing to 
wear. And then I reme mber that I had the woolen
 coat that was in storage some place. I went 
there and he was very happy to see me  [indeci
pherable] young [indecipherable] and he had my 
coat, so I had the coat  to wear. Well, it wasn™t
 easy. And then I didn™t do anything til I met the 

doctor, Otto Vulcan, whom I knew after the war,
 still in Poland. And 
he said, what are you 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0503  
63 
 
 
doing?  I said nothing. There no such thing as no
thing. You come  to the [indecipherable] room, 
and I went every day to work with him.

Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holoca ust Memorial Museum interview with 
Marianne Windholm. This is tape 
number three, side B. Wha t  I 
wanted to ask you about is, every 
day Austrians, people in the streets, people 
you would meet, people who were not Jewish, did 
you -- was it difficult to interact with them
 after the war?  Did you feel resentme nt? 
A: Me, I can -- I can tell you only one thing, I 
wasn™t very happy being home . When I come  
home , our superint endent said to me, ﬁOh, you ar

like he would be not very happy about it. And some
body else had our apartment, so I did cr -- I 
did leave it to other people. But I had a job, I wa
s happy, yeah. I was quite satisfied. I wi -- I had 
the job, I had money, which it was important. I re
me mber when I got my first [indecipherable] 
you had to have stamps to get ma terial, was ve
ry complicated. And I wa

chocol ate, thick chocolate. I 
went with the chocolate to the butcher, I sai
d, ﬁDo you want chocolate?
ﬂ He says yes. ﬁ Will you 
give me  me a t? ﬂ  That™s how I -- you know, that I 
get food. Wasn™t so easy. See, had everything, 
but you have to have money, mone y, which I didn™t have.

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0503  
64 
 
 
Q: -- did you contact them?   
A: Yeah, I contact them, yeah. 

Q: What was that like?  

A: We ll, she was very surprised to see 
me , and I don™t know, we were denounced from 
some body. Because we were there for a long, long time,
 and we used -- we have to go away from 
time to time to stay someplace else for a week, then we came back. But somebody denounced us, 

and we were arrested there. We  ca me  back at fi
ve o™clock in -- in the 
afternoon, at four o™clock 
in the morning the Gestapo came and arrest ed us
. And then we came to Auschwitz, and then we 
were selected. My husband went here, I here. I 
said, ﬁI want to go w
ith my husband.ﬂ Mengele 
was sitting there, and he said, ﬁBe glad you are 
not going.ﬂ And I never will forget the color of 
my husband™s face, gray. He knew. And I knew where he is going, yeah. 

Q: How did you emotionally deal with that at the time? 

A: I never will be able to tell you, because
 I knew what will happen to him, yeah. 
Q: Now, aft e r the war, when you came back to Vienna -- 

A: Yeah? 

Q: -- was it -- was it nice to see the woma n w
ho hid you, what was that like to see her again? 
A: We ll, I can™t reme mb er, I tell you. I went w
ith other people to [indecipherable] because the 
Israeli [indecipherable] there wa
s a letter from Anna Vietner, 
whom I know. It said, whoever 
knows Anna Vietner should go there and there. A
nd when I came there, they were hidden al -- 
th-through the whole war. She, her mother. Her ma
id must have hidden them, yeah, opened the 
door for me , and she started yelling when she 
saw me , and I was home . Was with people who 
knew me , who loved me , and I did feel good, yeah.  

Q: Who i -- who is Anna Vietner? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0503  
65 
 
 
A: We ll, she was a lady I knew, and much older than I. 
Q: Wa s she Jewish, or not? 

A: Jewish, yeah. 

Q: And she was -- 

A: But she looked like a Nazi. She didn™t look Jewi
sh at all, and she was dressed like one even. 

And she went -- wherever she went, her name  wa
s Vietner, wherever she went, she said, heil 
Vietner, which sounded like heil Hitler. 

Q: And that helped he
r get through the war? 
A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

Q: So she helped you when you got back to Vienna? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: And did you search for other re
lative -- for relatives of yours? 
A: I had very little relatives. My mot her had tw
o sisters. One was dead 
already, one was deported 
a long time  [indecipherable] there, and I had very 
little relatives, to think about it. I had relatives, 
but not in Vienna. 

Q: And wha t  about your mom -- your mother
, did you already know what had happened? 
A: She was in Theresienstadt, you know about Theresienstadt? 

Q: Yeah, I™m just wondering when did you le
arn about -- about what
 happened with your 
mother?  

A: Well, when I came -- I -- I went to my mother 
from time to time -- not from ti me to time, but 
at least twice a week wh
en I -- I was hidden, and I -- I reme mber
 it was late in the spring and I 
had a little box with strawberries. And I had 
to clean my hand to open the elevator. And the 
super come  out and said, ﬁ Where are you going? ﬂ I am going up to see Mother. She wa s picked 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0503  
66 
 
 
up last evening. And she was in Th
eresienstadt. And I knew the supe
rintendent in other district, 
and I spoke with her and we did ma ke packag
es and ma il them to Theresienstadt. And she 
received it, I know that, because one day, ma ybe af
ter one and a half years, was a long time she 
was there, ma ybe a year or so, a red letter came 
back that she was relocated. Then I knew that 
she went to Auschwitz. 

Q: Did you ever try to find her at Auschwitz? 

A: How cou l d I? 

Q: Wa s that while you were 
still there, or after? 

A: No, I knew that she is not alive. Children 
and old people they gasse
d right away. We knew 
that. We  did listen to the British sender. We  knew exactly what™s going on.  

Q: When did it become clear to you -- was it al
ready after the war, how massive the Holocaust 
really was?  

A: How wha t? 

Q: How -- how ma ssive the Holocaust really wa
s, how ma ny Jews, how ma ny peopl e were really 
victimized. 

A: I -- I knew it. I knew it from Ausc hwitz. We
 had selections, when you had one pimple on 
your body -- you know, they were so afraid of sc
abies, because we were a labor force which 
didn™t cost any money. We worked very hard. So if they -- you had one pimple on your body, 

you went, yeah. We re selections very often, I w
ould say at least once a week. We  was hed at 
night. When we came ba ck from wor k, we work
ed very hard, cleaning stones and everything. 
When we came back, in the washrooms, that water was dripping, no water. We  couldn™t even 
clean ourself. And one night I woke up, I saw 
two from our block that was where we were 
staying, block 13, go out -- everybody has a towel. 
I run after them and they went into the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0503  
67 
 
 
washrooms and that water was flowing. There was 
water and water [indecipherable] then I woke 
up Annie, we went every night, we washed from
 t op to bottom with ice cold water, but we 
keeped ourselves clean, yeah.  
Q: You never had hot water? 

A: No. Hot water?  Oh God. We  were 
glad we had cold water to wash.  
Q: So, back to Vienna after the war, it sounds 
like you spent a considerable amount of t i me  in 
Italy, and then you had returned to Vienna on the weekends, and about how long did -- did this 

go on for?  

A: Every weekend for a long time, I went back to Vienna. 

Q: And how long did you stay in Italy? 

A: Italy I was a long time. One year
 in Milan, and two years in Rome . 
Q: And were you happier livi
ng in Italy than Vienna? 
A: Oh, I was happy in Italy, oh God. I loved 
Italy so much. Wonderful country, wonderful 
people.  

Q: We re you still thinking 
you mi ght return to live in Vienna some day?  
A: No.  

Q: Why would you -- 

A: I -- 

Q: -- why did you know you didn™t wa
nt to live there any more? 
A: Well, I wouldn™t want to go ther e. I -- I told
 you I went there [indecipherable] I wouldn™t be 
there, no. I was there on
ce, after the war, on a trip to Europe. No.  
Q: Why?  Is it -- was it just not the same ?   

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0503  
68 
 
 
A: I wouldn™t want it any more. I 
-- first of all, I love a -- Am
erica. United States, and I loved 
Italy. But I hated Austria, oh yeah.  
Q: After the war, when did you ma ke  contact 
again with your friend Ann Price -- Ann Green? 
A: We ll, she was with me all the time, for a long 
time. But then we were separated. And I, very 
soon, was liberated, but she still wa
s not liberated where she was. 
They had a selection, she went 
on transport, and I did rema in. That was the night 
where they gassed all the 
Gypsies, yeah. Killed 
them, all the Gypsies.  

Q: Had you known some  of them per s onally? 

A: No.  

Q: So when did you me e t  up again with Ann after the war?  Was it in Vienna? 

A: I suppose so. Wa s in Vienna, yeah. She™s not
 from Vienna, you know, Ann Green. She™s from 
the little town Noyen Ky
rklund. She™s not Viennese. 
Q: But it seems like at some  point you -- you me t up with her again, and you became good 

friends again, right? 

A: Yes, we were. She is much younger than I am
, you know that. She is 15 years younger than I. 
Q: But it sounds like the two of you we
re very helpful to one another. 

A: Oh yeah. 

Q: Do you think it™s largely because of that frie
ndship that you were able to ma ke it through? 
A: Yeah, yeah. I told her, when we came to Ausc hwitz, and she came to me  very ups et, showing 

me  she had in her panties, in the seams she did find 
a louse. So I said to her, ﬁAnnie, listen to me , 
if I will take care of
 your lice, I will not be able to take 
care of mi ne. You w
ill not live and I will 
not live. If you will listen to me  and do whatev
er I tell you, maybe we w
ill make it.ﬂ And that 
how it was. We went every night, I woke her 
up, let™s go and wash, because then the water was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0503  
69 
 
 
flowing. We  had never water when
 we came home from work. Bu
t at night we had no towel, 
nothing. But we were undressed, 
we washed from top to bottom, yeah, every night. 
Q: We re there a lot of people w
ho did not wa-wash so regularly? 
A: Oh yeah. Sure, there was no water. 
Q: So you made a -- 

A: [indecipherable] the selections, as you know, 
wi -- you were not -- you were not hundred 
percent clean, I mean clean your skin, they were 
afraid of sicknesses, and you were gassed, sure.  
Q: So you made a special effort to stay clean? 

A: Oh yeah. I knew it™s important.  

Q: Now it sounds like you and Ann have remi nis
ced, you know, about your experiences together. 
Do you often talk about your experiences? 

A: No. We  s o me times laugh about, you know, ther
e were funny things too, who happened. So 
we speak about it, we laugh. Bu
t we norma lly, no we don™t.  
Q: Do you think it™s too difficu
lt to talk about
 these things? 
A: Sure, it™s still too difficu
lt. If you were in Auschwitz, you 
learn how to steal. You know, 
everybody likes to survive. So whatever you see 
you could steal, you steal. You don™t have a bad 
conscious if you do that.  

Q: What about your me mories, even if you we
ren™t speaking out loud about them, do these 
me mories come to you a lot 
of -- of these experiences? 

A: No. Sometimes I do think aboutit, but I didn™t thi
nk about it at all beca
use my life was full, 
you know, after the war. I had a good life, I 
was happily ma rried. But now, some ti me s I do 
reme mber, yeah.  

Q: Do you allow yourself to reme mb er more, or do you try to block some of the me mories? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0503  
70 
 
 
A: No, I still like to block them out. 
Q: It™s just ea
sier that way? 
A: Yeah, sure. 

Q: Now tell me  about your jour
ney comi ng to the U.S.. How i s  it that you came to the U.S., and 
when was that?   

A: What happened is, I was in Italy, and there 
was my brother, who al
ways wrote and said 
everybody™s here, everybody™s here. No you -- w
hy don™t you come , why 
don™t you come ?  I was 
so happy in Italy, but then I went to [indecipher able] and I had rheuma tic fever, I told you. They 

had put 30,000 dollar down fo

A: That™s could be, yeah. That™s could be. Yeah, 1950 fi -- I became a citizen 1955. Must be nine  

-- 1950. After five years you -- you become  a citizen, no? 

Q: I believe that™s right. I™m not sure, ma
ybe something was different at that time . 
A: No.  

Q: So, even though your brother wasn™t here, 
you decided to come  to the U.S., why?   
A: Because he s -- said I should come. And then
 my disappointme nt was terribl e. He was living 
in British West Indi a. 
Q: So where did you first arrive in the U.S.?  Di

General Stewart, I think, yeah. We  were

Q: And whe r e did it arrive, where did it dock? 
A: Thanksgiving. Came  -- we arrive Tha
nksgiving, and we docked next day, yeah. 
Q: Wa s that in New York? 

A: Yeah, New York, yeah. 

Q: And wha t  did you do when you first got he

A: I started to think about that

took a job in Troy, New York, was by Albany. 

Q: We re you on your own, or did you 
have any fa mily or friends? 
A: I had friends, yeah, I had friends. Have no 
family here. My brother then was living in 
Venezuela -- no, my brother in British We
st India, my cousins in Venezuela.  

Q: As I se -- 

A: But I started to ma ke money -- to earn money and I was happy, yeah. 

Q: What kind of work were you doing? 

A: Whatever I could. Fi rst of -- I was crocheting, 
and then came  that I had no money left, that

money to pay my room. And then
 I went and look for other job, 
and I got a job as [indecipherable]
 a whole -- they put together or
ders for custom jewelry, whole 
day on the ladder. And the boss was terrible. I made 30 dollars a week. I paid 10 dollars for my 

room, and at that time, you know, five dollar, five
 cent coffee and a roll. I did -- then I washed 
my hand in the evening, my boss came, and he™d gi
ve me  my envelope, put 
his hand in here, and 
said don™t tell my wife, I  just give you five dollar 
more. I called my brother, and I said, ﬁI am not 
going back any more. But what will happen to 
me ? ﬂ  He said, ﬁYou are in America. Here you 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0503  
72 
 
 
don™t have to go back. If he asks you why ar
en™t you comi ng back, you could tell him, I don™t 
like the color of your hair. There™s no explana
tion. You don™t want to, yo
u don™t go.ﬂ And then I 
took a job outside New York. No, then I took a j
ob at -- I met a doctor --
 oh God -- then I me t a 
doctor I knew in Europe, and he was a Sephard
ic [indecipherable] in Brooklyn, all the way 
down. He said come  and work with us. I took that job. 
Q: Did you feel a greater sense of freedom in -- in the U.S.? 

A: I did feel absolutely freedom. You know, the firs
t time, after a long time that I have f-felt that 
I am a free person. I remember when we were lib
erated, I was in Kraków, that is Poland, you 
know?  And I did see myself walking on the stre
et, like it wasn™t allowed to walk on the 
boardwalk, is -- are you crazy?  You™re a fr
ee person. You could go wherever you want.  
Q: When did you marry for the second time? 

A: I ma rried here the second time. Fourth of Se

was.  

Q: Wa s it in the 1950™s? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: What -- what was your husband™s 
name , and how did you meet him?  
A: I played Bridge with him, in
 a Bridge club. And whatever I di
d he criticized. It was terrible. 
So I said to him, ﬁN-Ne ver again ask me  to pl ay in your game .ﬂ He sa
id, ﬁThat™s all right, but 
ma y I invite you for dinner? ﬂ And I said, ﬁI woul
dn™t go with you.ﬂ But in the end we all went. 
Friends of mine, we all went together, and ve
ry soon we were ma rried, yeah. Wa s a Friday 
holiday, he said he could get downtown, cost tw
o dollars, get ma rried, and then we have four 
days as a honeymoon, yeah. Wa s married 22 years,
 20 wonderful years, two years terrible when 
he was so s -- terribly sick, yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0503  
73 
 
 
Q: What was his name? 
A: Seno. S-e-n-o. 

Q: And his last name? 

A: Wi ndholm. 

Q: Go ahead.  

A: And now you ask me  about the chicken, [inde
cipherable] remi nded me , it™s true. You know, 
my mother told me  I should pick up the chickens, they were by the [indecipherable], you know, 

ma de the m kosher, they k-kills them. So I went 
to put them -- pick them up, and I had the canvas 
bag. There were two chickens, th
at they started, you know, to move
. And I was so afraid, I throw 
them away, with the bag. But 
ha -- later they did find them. 
I came home without thechicken. 
You asked me  that, right? 

Q: So what happened 
when you got home ?   

A: When I get [indecipherable] home, where are 
the chickens? I said I throw them away. I was 
afraid they were still alive. So did you know
, at that time, nobody took anything. Wa s different 

times. 

Q: Did you get in trouble? 

A: No. I didn™t get in trouble. My
 mother was a wonderful person. 
Q: So I have just a few additional questions I think --  

A: Okay. 

Q: -- I think -- not that ma ny questions left 
to ask you, but a few. And I™ m wondering, was it 
difficult for you to adjust to norma l life
 after the war, af
ter the Holocaust? 
A: Yeah. Was difficult, yeah. Wa s difficult, yeah. 

Q: In what ways? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0503  
74 
 
 
A: In every way. You know, I told you, I did find 
myself wa lking on the stre
et -- I was afraid to 
go on the boardwalk, you know?  And took a long tim
e to come back to a normal life. When I 
started working, that did help me  a lot. I was bus
y, and you know, I had very little time  to think 
about myself. I was tired, I 
started to sleep good, yeah.  
Q: How do you think -- how do 
you think your experiences duri
ng the Holocaust affected -- 
affected you afterwards, affected you late
r, decisions you ma de in your life -- 
A: We ll, what should I tell you?  I tried to live
 a normal life. I was happily married, I told you 
that. I lost my husband, I was very unhappy. I ha
d a boyfriend later, I wa
s very happy again. And 
then, when he passed away, I said, I don™t want to
 cry after me n any more in my life. Now I will 
stay by mys e lf. I lost a lots of people 
I loved dearly, and th
at what it is.  
Q: Are there certain things about -- about your 
experiences during the wa
r, during the Holocaust 
that -- that really di rectly affected things that yo
u did later -- later in you
r life?  Decisions that you 
ma de, life choices?  Do you see the Holocaust
 as having affected
 those decisions? 
A: We ll, this is a very complicated question. 
I tried very hard to start to be an --

am a very lucky in one respect. I have good pe
ople around me whom I love, and they are good to 

me , and I am good to them. So I tried to keep a norm
al life, that is it. I watch television -- I watch 
-- I listen to radio, I listen to 
television, and of course, my life 
is different than from a norma l 
person, but I have to cope with it
. There™s nothing what I could do.  
Q: Did you ever turn to
 religion or prayer? 
A: No.  

Q: Do you observe the holidays? 

A: No. 

Q: The Jewish holidays? 

A: No. 

Q: Was that something that you 
just didn™t feel connected to? 

A: We ll, I did grow up in a house where every ho
liday was kept. We  had s e parate dishes for 
Easter, beautiful dishes
, and we kept every holiday, of c
ourse. But now I don™t keep anything.  
Q: Do you think the Holocaust had any 
effect on your thoughts about religion? 
A: I don™t think so. I still say oh God. You know what I mean? 

Q: Yeah. 
A: Yeah.

Q: Have you ever given thought to the question of 
-- of God a nd the Holocau
st, if there™s -- if 
there™s a God, how could the Holocaust have happened? 
A: We ll, it™s not the first time. There wa
s the Spanish Inquisition, there was a English 
Inquisition, as far as I reme mber, I don™t know. I am
 correct, I suppose. And this is not the first 
time that happened. We are still, after the Chin
ese, the olde st people on earth. The Chinese are 
older than we are.

ligion, did you stay very connected in your 
identity, to Judaism?

said, ﬁYou want to know if I a m Jewish?  I am.ﬂ  

Q: Have you ever had any dreams or nightma res 
that go back to the time period of the war? 
A: No. I don™t think so.  

Q: And whe n did you start talking more about 
your experiences during 
the war?  Whe n did you 
start to do that? 

A: I never talked about it. With whom?  

Q: Like with Debbie, or with, you know
, any of the people you™re close to. 
A: Nor mally I only start to tell them what
 is funny. Funny stories, yes, nothing else.  
Q: Do you think it™s unusual that -- that you™re
 able to -- to capture 
those funny mo me nts?  Do 
you think a lot of people would not
 reme mber the funny mo me nts? 
A: How could I know what other pe
ople do?  I never speak with them. 
Q: But it does seem like the humor is very important to you. 

A: To me , yeah. To me , yeah.

breakfasts, when they did bring the milk 
by in the morning, I waited for them by the 
[indecipherable] pass by and boom, t ook some  out. Ha

have my second breakfast. When I did some thing wrong, they didn™t se nd me  to work, so I will 

not get a second potato, but I had 
to go to pick up the potatoes,
 some body has to go. I have so 
ma ny potatoes, oh God, yeah. It was not easy, yeah. Yeah. 

Q: Has it been difficult during this interv
iew for you to reme mber certain things? 
A: Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely.  

Q: Is there anything else you would li
ke to share?  Any other memories? 
A: I only know one thing. I was 
happy. And my sister did find 
me  to the Vatican. And when I
