Question: This is the 
United States
 
Holocaust Memorial Museum 
interview 
conducted by 
Peggy Frankston
, with 
Joyce Mizrachi
 on July 23
rd
, 2009, in 
New 
York City
, and it™s for the 
Rivesaltes
 Internment Camp Me
morial Museum. Thank 
you for coming today. Would yo
u introduce yourself, please? 
Answer: Okay. My name is 
Joyce Saltz Mizrachi
, and I was born May 13
th
, 1941. 
We™re not quite sure; my  mo ther says I was born May 11
th
, but she wanted me to 
have my  own birthday, so it became the 13
th
. My name was then given as 
Josefina
(ph). Why, we don™t know. I was Œ never was explained, except my  mo ther 
did tell my father to tell
 them that my name was
 Judith
. He did what he wanted, 
and I became 
Josefina
(ph) for nine years of my life. I d on™t remember 
Rivesaltes
. I 
was born in 
Rivesaltes
, but I do not rememb er anything about it, of course. I know 
my  mo th er left 
Rivesaltes
, and I stayed. I was the excuse
 for her to leave, and she 
always told me that I™m the one who save
d them. The ta Œ I don™t know how lo ng I 
stayed Œ can you stop it? 
Q: Sure. Do you want us to
 put your glasses on the table? 
A: No, I need a prop. 
Q: Okay .

A: I don™t know how long it took fo r her to
 get me back, but I know I mu st have 
been about one Œ one and a half? One? I™m
 not sure. I have been trying to  get 
information, but I haven™t gotten anything 
so far. I do have a booklet that was given 
to my mother when they br
ought her Œ when th
ey brought me to her, and it has the 
pictures of the women who Œ th e nurses w
ho took care of me, who were Swiss Red 
Cross nurses, and some pictures of different
 periods, which I still have. We Œ after ri 
Œ
 Rivesaltes
, we went to 
Tres
, and there I have very few memories. The first 
memo ry I have is not feeling well, not 
being ab le to speak, and my  mo ther going 
back and forth. I think it™
s my mother. And there must
 have been a little mirror, 
because I remem Œ that™s the only thing I 
remember, and I know I was very young. 
And then  I do rememb er 
Tres
. Not 
Tres
, 
Marseilles
. W e went to 
Marseilles
, it was 
the end of the war, and there were a lot of ai
r raids, and we used to go to shelters. 
The one I remember p articularly well was th
e time I locked myself in the room, and 
the air raids went on and my mother went
 hysterical and my  father had to break 
open the door. I reme mber getting a good sp
anking fo r that later, and I reme mb er 
we did go to the shelters. 
The shelters were very fright
ening, because they were 
very dark, to me at the time,
 they were dark and cold. An
d I always cried. So there 
was a gentleman that I remember that we al
ways used to see. His wife was blind. 
That I still remember. And he taught me ho
w to Œ taught me different songs. And

that, I guess, stopped my  crying, which became
 a pain in the neck  to everyone else. 
I remember that. And I remember the di
fferent things. I remember b eing very 
spoiled by a lot of very  diffe
rent people. And I never had 
wh at my  sister and brother 
had. I never remember hunger, because
 I was never hungry. I was frightened 
because no matter how young you are, pe
ople™s emotions do Œ 
do penetrate, and 
fear is very, very noticeable and affective.
 It affects you. So I was always frightened 
of that. I was always afraid of being take
n away. The other thing I remember is that 
I guess it was Œ it was a big Cat
holic organization, and in 
France
 the nuns had very 
big headdresses. I don™t know th e order, 
but I reme mb er we used to get hot 
chocolate there, or something like it. And my
 mother Œ I was so s Œ very afraid of 
my  mo ther leaving me, and being very Œ sc
reaming very badly. Those are the things 
I remember, being very fri
ghten ed . So  reme mb er being in back of a woman, 
because 
Marseilles
 w as a very, very rough city, at 
that time especially, because it 
was near the waterfront. And 
walking Œ and we were walk
ing behind a couple, and 
she had her bag over her wrist, an d some
body just cutting the bag off. And she 
stood there with just the strap, screaming,
 and we were not far behind. I don™t know 
if my  father was there, because he usua
lly was very good at 
running after anybody 
who was Œ had to be caught. 
And that always, always st
uck in my  mind. There was 
a couple who wanted  to adopt me, and my  
mother said, no way. It was a friend of

theirs, I Œ I don™t know, they just figured
 my  mo ther had two children and they had 
none, and times were very bad. And sh
e said, probably , I don™t know who they  
were. I know my friend Œ friends
 of ours that still live in 
Brussels
 told 
Lucie
 about 
it when she was in 
Brussels
. I don™t know who it was, someday I™ll go, in th e near 
future, because they™re rather old, and I ha
ve to go and see what
 they know. Then I 
reme mb er co min g  to  
Belgium
 after the war, going to school. Things were very 
tough in  
Belgium 
after the war. Work was very 
difficult. The anti-Semitism was 
horrible, very, very strong. I went to sc
hool in yeshiva, but
 because I was very 
rambunctious, not the greatest student, becaus
e I couldn™t care less, and I didn™t like 
it. There was an orphanage ne
arby of all the kids that had lost their parents during 
the war, and they were sent to 
France
 and from 
France
 they were going to be sent 
to 
Israel
, eventually, or some other place, or stay in 
France
. And th at made me  
very frightened. And ultimately my mo ther
 was asked to find another school for me, 
because I was such a wonde
rful child. They were thrille
d to see me g o , and I was 
thrilled to get out. And the next
 school I went to was an all-girls sch ool. It was not a 
Hebrew school, it was very Œ it was mixed.
 Very few Jews, and I was one of them. 
And the antisis Œ anti-Semitism was very much felt when I wa
s told, it™s a shame 
that they didn™t get you too. And I didn™t
 know what they we
re talking about, 
because my parents never spoke about it, not
 in front of me. My father never sp oke

about it til the day he died, til he had 
Alzh eimer™s
, then he went back through 
everything. So he never spoke ab out anythi
ng. But I never understood wh at she was 
talking about. It was Œ it was tough.
 Then we came and what we did for 
entertainment was we went to the movies
. And I decided that, since I entertained 
everybody anyway Œ I 
used to put on accents Œ I had 
to do that, I felt, because 
everybody was always so grouchy, and that 
made them laugh. So  I entertained. And 
coming to this country meant th
at I wanted to know where 
Hollywood 
was. I was 
nine on the boat, and it was Œ I was thrilled.
 I was thrilled to co
me, til I came and I 
didn™t particularly care for it. I was very 
homesick, I missed my friends. My parents 
did not talk about their experience when  I 
was young in front of 
me. It was all kept 
very quietly. We came to this country , an
d my  father, who did not want to come, 
only wanted to go to 
Israel
. My mother refused. She sa
id that she was not going to  
have us taken away any mo re
, and he had a choice. He e
ither could come Œ because 
she had one sister left, that lived here Œ he
 had a choice; either he came with us, and 
she was going and sh e was taking us, or th 
Œ he could go and 
he™d never see us 
again. So she blackmailed him 
into coming, which wasn™t 
really the best thing for 
him, because he could never adjust very 
well to this country. She loved it. And 
every day I thank her. She di
d speak about it, ultimately,
 but he never, ever, ever 
spoke about it. I never knew he was in th
e resistance. I never knew that he had

gotten people out of the camp , because 
he was a plumber, and he knew the
 
underground wo rks, wh ere he had to fix thi
ngs, and that™s how he got people out. I 
never knew all these th ings. Everything 
about him was a my stery, yet he was a 
wonderful father. He was wo
nderful when we were little
, because he managed to 
play with us like a child, and have the 
most wonderful stories for us. She Œ my 
mo ther was very depressed for mo st of th
e time that I remember when I was sma Œ 
young. I remember her crying a lot. I re
me mber her wh en her niece™s birthday and 
her nephews, or whoever, always having Œ 
we didn™t have very much money, but 
she always managed to get flowers next to
 their picture. And I always think Œ I 
always thought, I don™t get flowers on my
 birthday, or anything like that. Why do 
they? I always had a feeling Œ well, it™s my
 own insecurity, but I was always afraid 
that she was not my mother, b
ecause I used to think, if you Œ she got me out when I 
was one or two, how did she know it wa
s me? Who told her it was me? Children 
change. How did she know? We stayed at the 
HIAS 
when we came, and that was 
really a shelter. It was a lot of different 
people from a lot of different places, an d it 
was very much like a shelter, today, I wo
uld imagine. There were cots. And my  
aunt felt that that really wasn™t proper fo
r me, and I stayed with her. And I was Œ as 
I said, I was always very Œ my  sister and brother do not want to think th at I 
experienced anything. If I say I rememb er some
thing, they™re very fast to either say,

no you can™t, you™re too young. 
They Œ it™s a form of protecting me, but it™s the way 
they were.  
Q: Sorry, that™s my phone, so rry about that. I™ll shut it off. 
A: Shall I wait? 
Q: Excuse me. 

A: For me the 
HIAS 
was very exciting, it was very different. And I thought, oh, 
what a different place, what a different wo
rld. But I soon Œ and then we moved to 
Riverside Drive
 and I went to school. Bu t there were always things lingering, there 

was always this heaviness that I rememb
er. W h en I went to school, high school, 
there were a lot of Œ which was 
Washin gton Heights
, there were a lot of refugees 
there, and it™s funny how you 
click. And th at™s what you do. Even  later on you do. 
And the frighten ing thing was, one of my  
friends found out wh en she was 16 that 
that was not her parents, they were aunt
 and uncle. Sh e was put
 up as a child. And 
that reinforced my feeling that, oh I Œ I 
know she™s not my  mo ther. And I reme mb er 
thinking Œ and I know, because I was su
ch a difficult child. I was difficult also 
because she was 43 when she had me. I wa
s not exactly what you call a planned 
child. And I remember thinki
ng, yeah, if I™m gonna have
 a kid, I™m gonna have 
somebody like you. Til mu ch later in life th
at I realized she is 
my mother because I 
look just like her. But that c
ould be with adopted child as 
well. I am ju Œ I am very

much like her, and I know, I know that who 
Œ that I™m not. Not that it would matter 
anyway, after a certain age. As a mother 
she was a fantastic mother. She let me live 
and be wh o I am, which is mo
re than I can say for a lot of children of Œ who are 
survive Œ children of survi
vors. Because they burden Œ 
there is a burden on you. 
There is a Œ a very heavy burden  on you th
at you have to protect, even when  it 
comes to your siblings, and you cannot do certain things that would upset them too 
much, because they were upset
 enough. But all in all they were Œ she really did a 
phenomenal job. Sh e is the reason why we™re alive. She is the one who 

masterminded everything. But a lot of it wa
s also a lot of luck, because she was 
stopped by Gestapo, and she 
was Œ and he looked at her and he said, I will let you 
go this time, but if I catch you again, you 
will not survive. So things like that did 
happen. She did not Œ one thing she did te
ach me, was not to dislike anybody for 
anything that happe
ned before. And that I™m thr
illed about, because I do have 
friends that are everything different. As I sa
id, she didn™t put all the uglin ess on me, 
but unfortunately we do that ourselves. 
I don™t Œ I™m very careful who I speak to 
about it. I don™t watch any movies with 
anyone around me, that pertain to the 
Holo caust. And you get your own things th
at you have to live through and wo rk 
through, but I didn™t have the hardship that
 they had. For that, I™m lucky too. Okay. 
And that™s my  story.

Q: Thank you. You are ha
ppy that came to the 
United States
, and you have a life 
here. What you talked about,
 talent for entertaining, a
nd Œ that might have come 
from the need to Œ 
A: Of course. 
Q: Can you tell me one of th
e things you Œ wh at your ca
reer was, what Œ wh at you 
did? 

A: I was a lab technician, hematology lab technician
 
like my siste r, because my 
mother wanted me to do th at. But when  I Œ 
as soon as I made a little money, I went 

to tech Œ I went Œ decided to try to do ac
ting, cause I did it all along. So I went to Œ 
had a wonderful technique teacher, 
Anthony Menino
, have you ev er heard of him? 
Anthony Menino
? And th en I went to 
Herbert Berghof
 studios, and I studied with 
Bill Hickey
(ph). And I did play s. I did different
 things, nothing major. Then I got 
married and for some reason I thought that 
if I had children I had to  be with them, 
which was stupid. Bu t I also didn™t have 
the need that I had before. I™m sorry I 
didn™t pursue it more, but there were obstacl
es when I did. My brother, I remember 
telling my  father, you have to do someth
ing. She can™t go to
 acting school. You 
know what™s in acting schools, they™re 
all sick. And a few other things. And my  

father smiled and let him talk and he says
, you do wh at you wa
nt. And I did, and it 
was wonderful, I loved it. I really enjoyed 
it. And I always said someday I™ll do it

again, and I just Œ I™ve done small things
, but nothing like I really wanted to do. 
That™s my  fault, no one stopped me except 
me. But I found th at it™s a great thing to 
do, especially when I was little, because it rea
lly made life so mu
ch more bearable. I 
used to go to  the movies, watch what they
 did and I copied the whole thing. The 
only thing th at I remember that really I™m 
th rilled about, when my father was in the 
hospital, when he was Œ had 
Alzh eimer™s
, and he was pretty bad, I said, do you 
know who I am? And he said yes Œ and th
is didn™t happen very  often Œ you™re my  
child. I rememb er how you Œ and I Œ I rememb
er all the accents yo
u used to do. And 
one of them was the Hungaria
n accent, and of course we
 spoke Yiddish. So it was 
an imitatio n of the Hungarian Jewish neig
hbor, and he found it very funny. And 
strange, when he was very ill, different thi
ngs did come out, lik
e sleeping with his 
shoes, because he™d have to 
run and hide, used to
 tell us to hide. But that was Œ you 
know, with every hardship and with every 
horrible thing, there is some good, and 
there is some nice things 
that you can remember. For 
the longest time I couldn™t 
think of my father because I didn™t want to
 think of him that wa
y. Took a long time, 
and now I can think of it, a
nd I can think of the nicer pa
rts. For someone who did so 
much good, sad to think that that ha
d to happen. But, you know, we™re not 
privileged. The only way I found out about hi
s family was that we  f o und a cousin in 
California 
who was really Œ who™s like my  thir
d cousin  or second cousin. And sh e

knew all about his grandmot
her and his Œ and my  gran
dfather. I had no id ea about 
them. I had no idea about anything. I found out that my  great-grandmother had a 
school for girls and taught them how to re
ad, in a ghetto structure. But I never knew 
all these things. I never knew anything. It
™s almo st like being adopted, wh en you 
don™t know who your grandparents are rea
lly. You don™t know Œ you don™t have 
any aunts and uncles, you do
n™t have any cousins. There™s no one there. The reason 
we™re so close is because that™s it, that wa
s what we had. That™s
 who we had to rely 
on, that was it. There was no one else. And 
then we came to th
is country and I had 
an aunt, and she had Œ but her ch ildren were
 mu ch older than Œ because she was my  
mo ther™s oldest sister. And she decided that
 we were too European, she really didn™t 
want too mu ch of us. Sh e was a little ment
ally deranged . And we didn™t see her that 
much. So there was never an
yone until I got married, and 
I did marry into a very 
large family, and I found that very, very
 comforting, because my  children always 
had cousins and friends 
and Œ and the whole thing. And it was lovely. 
Q: Thank you very much. 

A: You™re welcome. Very thr
ee different pers
onalities though.
