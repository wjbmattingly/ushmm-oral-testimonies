ERNA KARPLUS 
 August 27, 1997 
 
Beginning Ta pe One, Side A 
 
Question: Le t me  ask you first, Mrs. Karplus, if
 you could, say your name  and where we are right 
now, and we can say that the date is August 27
th
, 1997. And if you could say your name  and 
where we are right now, and then we™ll go from there, okay? 

Answer: I am Erna Karplus, and we are inmy apartment on Beacon Street, in Brookline, 

Massachusetts. 

Q: Okay, that™s August 27
th
, 1997. 
A: Sorry. 

Q: No, no, that™s okay, I can add that. We ll, I have ma ny ques tions for you. 

A: I™m so glad.  

Q: And I guess I™ll start out by just asking you to 
talk and reflect a littl
e bit about your childhood, 
and yo -- did you grow up in Vienna? 

A: I was born in Vienna, and I had three siblings
. I was the youngest, and 
I lived in Vienna, but 
from ™32 to ™36 I was in Paris, and lived in Pa
ris. And then I went back because I married a 

friend of mi ne whom I knew only 11 years. So we 
decided to ma rry. And I l
oved to be in Paris, 
of course, it was a wonderful experience as a you
ng Viennese. People liked the Viennese people. 
They hated -- the French people hated the German
s, but they liked the Viennese, so I wa s lucky, 
and had a wonderful time. I was working there, b
ecause one could only take
 little money there. I 
could live only three mo nths of the money which 
I™ve taken with me . So I started es -- I wanted 
to stay longer than three months
, and I started as soon as possibl
e to earn money to stay longer. 
And so I stayed longer, I went always in summer
 back to Vienna, and also f -- I went skiing, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444

met my friends for Christmas, and then in su
mmer I went also -- I really did a lot of 
mountaineering, summer  and winter, fall and spri
ng, all the time we were on the mountains as 
youngsters. 
Q: Well tell -- tell me a little bit about that  
and growing up in Vienna again. What was it like 
being a child in Vienna? Do you -- was it -- wa
s it a -- was it a -- a 
me mo rable childhood -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- do you reme mber ma ny things?  What are so
me  of the things you reme mber mo st about 
your childhood? 

A: Of course, first was school, and I was six y
ears in the gymnasium whe r e you learn Latin and I 
think at that time we learned English there.
 I feel I had a very 
happy childhood. We  had ma ny 
friends and it was of -- was, of course, very di
fferent to what™s going on here. We  didn™t -- we™re 
not allowed to go in a nightclub, or outside. We  al
ways had some  sis -- parties, some  parties at 

home , so that was with -- really lovely. We  had 
a big apartme nt, and as we  were four, we had 
ma ny friends, and we [indecipherable]
 parents loved also to entert
ain, so we  had to always saw 
the friends at home. My -- first, of course, I was not as much in the mountains, but when I grow 
up as a -- and had friends. If we
 -- if I say boyfriend, it does notmean like here that you sleep 

with them. S-S -- ju -- it was everything very plat
onic, and -- but we had ma ny friends, and with 

them we went to theater, or to the concert, or
 weekend to the mountains
. That™s -- I loved the 
mountains, and the f -- a-and whether it was skiing
 or rock climbing, everything was lovely for 
us, and for me . Then, a f ter my six years of gymnasium, I decided to be
come  a photographer, and 

-- 

Q: How old were you then?  How old were you? 

A: 16, probably. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
3 
 
 
Q: 16. 
A: Just a mi nute. It was six, 11 -- no, seven, se
ven -- 17. Because five class -- five were ca -- 
public school, that means the lower classes, and th
en there for six years in the gymnasium, that™s 
11 years, and you started with 
six years, so that was 17.  
Q: 17. 

A: And first I worked at a photographer, and th
en I went to a school where I learned about 
photography and printing and so on.  

Q: And wha t  pro -- what drew you in
to -- what attracted you to photography? 
A: I think it™s -- we always have taken pict
ures, and then I me t some body, a photographer, who 
talked about it, and suddenly I decided I™d ra
ther to go two more years and to ma ke my 
[indecipherable] as to go to 
study photography. But then, I admit 
my -- it was called master exam 
for photography, it™s not like here ma
ster. I was first an apprenti
ce. It goes like 
-- I don™t know 
how you call it here, you know?  And then I ma de 
my ma ster for photography, and I worked at 
the photographer. Then -- I always have taken 
exercises. Not only me , everyone in Vienna had, 
Mother and everyone has taken exercises, and 
my teacher said, you™re so gifted, why don™t you 
study to be an exercise teacher
?  So I propose this to my fath
er, who was horrified. You never 
will need to work, you will ma rry and never wi
ll need to work again. And now you have 

photographer, for what do you want to study to be
 a exercise teacher?  Luckily, my brother-in-
law, Dr. Felix Fleischner talked for me , he was a
ll for it, said I st-study what I want, and luckily 
Father agreed. He had to agree because one has 
to pay, of course. And I studied to be a phot -- 
exercise teacher and got my diploma  in Vienna. 

Q: When was this, appr oximately? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
4 
 
 
A: The diploma, ach, I have it some where. Le t me  think. Six, 17, that wa s [inaudible] 24 - 25, 
probably ™29. 

Q:  ™ 2 9?   

A: Nine, cause --  

Q: What year were you born, by the way? 

A: Seven. 

Q: 1907? 

A: In seven, yes. 

Q: Oh, okay. 

A: Yes, I will have my 90
th
 birthday this year in Nove
mber. I can™t believe it.  
Q: You don™t look like you
™re about to have your 90
th
 birthday. 
A: No, I will look like 102, but I 
am not. Anyway, then, when I ma de my diploma, I worked for 
[indecipherable] photography, and I worked as an ex
ercise teacher, after I have the diploma. In 
Vienna you have to have a diploma, not like here
 that everyone can putout her shingle without 
ever learned anything. And also, where you teach, 
it was -- some body ca me  to look whether it is 
the proper place to teach. Whether 
it™s clean enough, whether it ha
s the shower and so on. [phone 
ringing] 

Q: Do you need to get that? 

A: [indecipherable] [tape break] -- 
is not a nurse, but she was with
 my sister [indecipherable]  
Q: Ah, I see. 

A: And she calls sometimes, see how everything is. 

Q: Ah, oh. Okay.  

A: Is settle. Do you have it on? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
5 
 
 
Q: Yes. Do you want me to turn it off?  [tape break]. Continuing. Go ahead. 
A: I love to teach exercises, and too, I was very 
ha ppy to start in Vienna with it, and I was also 
teaching like we have here, the st -- ca -- fo
r instance, the Cambridge Center for Adult 
Education. So there were in Vienna [indeciphe
rable] which were really started to ma ke  
grandfather of the brother-in- la
w of mi ne, of Hartma n, and I was teaching, for instance in the 
Luderhatte mon volksheim. And I probably did not
 work the whole day from morning evening, 
that I don™t reme mber, but I enjoye
d to work, and to do things and 
of course weekend we always 
went away, a group of people. We  were severa
l who always me t in the train and we went 
some place. Then, in ™32, I got the chance to go to Paris. It was -- as I say, it was three months. I 

had some  money and I loved to go to Paris, al
so to practice my French. We had always as 
children, when we were young, we had a governess ve
ry long, and then a 
French teacher, who 
went also with us at -- in su
mmer for vacation. I think she learned more German than we learned 

French, but it was a possibility to learn 
French. And so I went to Paris, but -- 
Q: We ll yeah, okay, that™s fine. We  -- we can -- le
t -- let me just ask you 
one specific thing about 
-- 

A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

Q: -- about Vienna when you were a child. You know
, in doing some  reading about the history of 
anti-Semitism in Austria, there is quite a bit of
 history going back to long before you were born, 
and I™m just wondering, y-you™re 
describing us a ch -- an -- a 
nice, a pleasant childhood, do -- 
did you -- we re there things when you were a lit
tle girl, I mean, before the anschluss that you 
noticed? I mean, were there -- did your gra
ndfather have problems , did your parents have 
problems, did you have any problems? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
6 
 
 
A: Never. Never. We  had always also some  Gen
tile friends, who went with us to mountains, we 
were invited. Everything went -- we -- I never 
felt an anti-Semitisms. I 
-- i-in fact grew up, my 
father was very religious. I was not allowed to 
write on Saturday at school, we had school at 
Saturday. And there was another girl who was not
 allowed to write. So there were never given 
written examinations on Saturday because we didn™
t write. But there was never -- I never felt any 
anti-Semitisms as long we were there, til Hitler
came. We were very 
lucky this way, we had 
always, as I say, Gentile friends, 
and in fact, our Jewish friend
s had very nice Gentile fr iends 
whom they married after Hitler to
 -- to go out with them. That -- 
to emigrate with them. So we 
were really a mi xed group. More Jews than Gen
tile, but we were mi x and I never suffered.  
Q: Did you hear of anyone, any Jewish friends 
or -- or acquaintances, or even people you had 
heard about who had a problem?   

A: Only, for instance at the university. It was very
 hard for my brother-in-law, who was an x-ray 

doctor, Roentgenologist. He was only [indeciphera
ble] and not -- could not become  professor. 
Then there was, at the university, a Jewish pr
ofessor, m- my husband™s uncle was professor of 
neurology. But that was really seldom that a Jew 
got a professorship. That I knew, that I heard. 

But otherwise I really never personally felt it, th
at the anti-Semitism was -- I knew it was there, 
but I didn™t feel it. I didn™t -- 

Q: Ho-How did you know it was there?  How di -- how were you -- 

A: For instance, about this university, and then, 
now I try to think. I really -- I don™t reme mber 
anything special before Hitler -- 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: -- that is -- but I d -- I knew 
that there is anti-Se mitisms. I 
try to reme mber, but I don™t know, 
I™m sorry.

Q: Were ther e stor ies, Mr s. Karplus, at that  ti
me of -- of Jewish fa milies wanting to assimilate 
and in some  cases actually convert? Wa- Was th
ere -- were there convers
ions to Christianity 
going on i-in the desire to assimilate, or -- 
A: No, not much. No, e xcept that many, ma ny who 
were not at all religious. For instance, we 
three sisters ma rried three me n w
ho were not at all re
ligious, but they -- they didn™t convert, I 
mean, and my husband said always for a joke he 
would never convert. Maybe, if he would fall in 
love with a woma n, then he would co -- he 
would convert, but no-nobody I knew. That doesn™t 

say it didn™t exist, but nobody I kne
w converted. We all -- they a
ssimilated really, very much. 
My father came  what was afterwards Poland, at th
at time  whe n he was born it was still Austria. 
But he was very religious, and that 
was really seldom that si -- si --
 that one is so religious. More 
-- all my fr iends were really assi milated, 
and not at all -- and had Christma s tree. 
Q: So they weren™t practicing or obs
ervant in that -- in that sense. 
A: Yeah, but re -- Christma s tree didn™t m
ean to us a Catholic festivity. It was -- 
Q: M-More of a cultural 

A: -- cultural, yeah. 

Q: -- or a national -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Uh-huh. Mm-hm.  

A: [indecipherable] again and again. And so, for in
stance, all of my in-law
s had Christmas trees, 
and my -- and my mother-in-law, everyone had. Bu
t -- but we did not have it at home, because 
Father was Jewish religious, so we didn™t have it
. In fact we had a kosher house, and we kept it 
as youngster, but then, more and more, we kept it le
ss. But at first real -- 
we really ke -- were -- 
also tr-tried to do everything my father and moth
er wanted to do. We  kept all the -- for -- for 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
8 
 
 
instance, all the holidays,
 Jewish holidays at home. So, as a youngster, I really did not suffer by 
anti-Semitism, was -- and we were very lucky 
probably, our group of people, because we were 
mi x in, as I said. Two of my very good friends ha
d Gentile friends and then they ma rried them, 
so s -- they went together out from the -- Austria. 

Q: And whe n you were a child with your -- with 
your father being o-obser
vant, did you belong to 
a synagogue? 

A: We  went to synagogue when the parents were th
ere, to visit, of course. We visited Mother, 
because it was -- sometime it was also separated,
 the me n and the wome n in -- in one of the 
temple after [indecipherable] not. So we always 
went there to visit Mother, when she was af -- 
there. Father was probably more 
in the temple than Mother, but Mother  also observed with -- 
with Father, and -- but a-as a 
little child, I felt also religious, but then less and less. 
Q: And how did -- what -- what kind 
of feeling was that  as a little 
child, to -- to be
 religious as a 
child?  Do you reme mbe r
 the feeling you had? 
A: It was -- I try to remember. It
 was quite of course, to go up as
 a little, little one with it. You 
know, it was quite of course that we thought like 
our parents were thinking. And this was so 
tradition to have all the holidays. And at -- pr
obably felt myself religious because I wouldn™t 
have touched what wasn™t allowed, for instance,
 ham. I woul dn™t touch. I would not, never as a 
youngster, eat what I was not allowed 
to eat for the religious reason. 
Q: So that everything wa
s kosher in your fa mily? 
A: Yeah, in my fa mily, my fa mil
y, but not -- one friend of my si
ster™s family was also kosher, 
but otherwise all our frie
nds were not religious at all, br
ought up. They were conscious Jews, I 
think, but not religious. In general, they were ve
ry assimilated, really. We all felt Viennese, and 
not Jewish Viennese. We 
didn™t emphasize the Jews in -- but 
we felt very Viennese, of course, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444

growing up there, and living there, and we loved 
Vienna. So, I am sorry I can™t say -- I me an, I 
think I only accepted what my parents expected from us children. 

Q: What many children -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- most children do. 

A: At that time . And then, afterwards, I mean 
when I was ma ybe 16 or 17
 years old, I -- I felt 
different. I felt that it is really 
some  of the things I didn™t want  
to accept. For instance, I wasn™t 
allowed to ring the bell when I came  home  the 
apartment. To me it was much more work to 
knock than ringing the bell like that. 

Q: Wa s this every day, or just on Shabbat? 

A: Every day. We  were not allowed to ring the 
-- oh, excuse me , that -- that was a good question 
of you and a bad answer of me . It -- yes, it proba
bly was only si -- as --
 as -- as -- Saturday 
Shabbes, you are right. It 
was not the whole week. 
Q: But -- but it mu-must  have seemed like more, because you reme mbered it as every day, right? 
A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, but, you know, 
it is a few years ago, so -- 
Q: A couple of years. 

A: -- it™s [indecipherable] and my
 me mory doesn™t get better. I m
ean, my si -- one sister had the 
wonderful me mory and I never had th
e good me mory and it didn™t get better. 
Q: Well, it seems pretty good to me. 

A: No, no, it didn™t get better. 

Q: Well, let -- let me ask you a li
ttle bit about -- now, your
 -- your father and -- and his work, and 
-- and did his work allow you all to ha
ve a -- a comfortable lifestyle -- 
A: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
10 
 
 
Q: -- or was it a di fficult one? 
A: Most of the time father -- we had the very 
good life. We  had piano lessons and basic French 
and the English, and the -- and 
Mother had every day a hairdr
esser comi ng, and everything -- 
that was like that in Vienna. So we had -- 

Q: Uh-huh, and domestic help, did you have -- 

A: And dom -- of course -- 

Q: Maids and cooks? 

A: -- two dome stic help. We had the lovely apar
tment we had and that means we moved from a 

smaller apartment to a bigger apartment. You ha
d to buy the apartment and Father could do it. 
And he really gave us all the opportunities to 
learn and to come  and go. He was not delighted 
that I spent so much money when we went sk
iing when I was older. When -- I went skiing 
because that cost money, the train. And there he
 was not -- he thought that I spend too much 

money on the -- for the train, for the -- but to 
me  it was important. And my  future husband, who 
was always with us, had in fact a ticket for not
hing because he had the high pos-position in the 

newspaper. So he had, for all the trains, if he wa
nted first class, to go fi
rst class, wherever he 
wanted, he had the ticket. So for birthday I got some ti me s tickets, so to go, so to be able to go 

every weekend, and I did. 

Q: And did you all travel, did you take
 vacations abroad, or di d you -- 
A: Always. When we were small, Mother went with
 us vacation. We  we nt to -- first years always 
to Salzburg, because Mother™s parents lived there,
 and we went for summer and also Christma s, 
we went to Salzburg for our vacation. Close by --
 to Salzburg was a suburban place, and there 
the parents rented the house, so we went always
 to this house in Salzbu
rg. And the mos t  exciting 
was that we were there at the begi nning when 
Reinhardt st arted to have the place in Salzburg, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
11 
 
 
because now it is quiet, of course, but my brother 
was in one of the place, and very little role so 
we could always go to all the [i
ndecipherable] rehearsa
ls. So it was wonderful, we knew all then, 
all the li -- wonderful actor a
nd actresses. And that was the 
fi rst year that was played 
ﬁJederma nnﬂ, by Hoffne r  -- by Hofmannsthal. Hofm
annsthal was a Viennese and ﬁJederma nnﬂ 
was a play by him and it was played in front of 
the beautiful church, a lovely, lovely church. And 
we were very proud, of course that our brothe
r was of the stage. We  were very young. So 
Salzburg was important. Afterwards we went to Ital
y with Mother, and we  went to -- where else?  
We -- fit -- Italy several time s, and always to 
a beach to swim. And in the year 1914, we were, 
for instance in Italy at the beach in Ca rrado, a
nd then we saw a ma n going with a drum on the 
beach, and we children, I was six an
d a half years -- we children were delighted, but in reality, he 
announced that the war broke out. 1914 til ™18 was th
e war. So, of course, Mother wa s in despair 
only to get home . All she wanted, to get home. 
Q: And so this -- you thought this man was ma ki ng nice music? 
A: Yeah, that -- that was lovely
 for a child, a drum, to go with the drum, and I had no idea, of 
course, what it was, and then Mother tried to ex
plain to us. But then it was the fi rst World War, 
™14 to ™18, and Austria was, up to then very big, 
and then it is -- became  a very little country, 
because Hungary left ma ny Roma nian born a -- so
 ma ny countries were taken, were occupied by 
the -- by the [indecipherable]. Austria became a sma
ll -- a small country. But st -- during the war, 
of course, we suffered very much. 
Q: During World War I? 

A: Just awful. 

Q: And how is that --
 tell me  about that. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
12 
 
 
A: We didn™t get to eat, and you had to stand in
 line for hours to get, I don™t know how ma ny 
eggs, ma ybe  two eggs. And we children went all 
after school, always stan
ding in line. And often 
we had the same  dresses, but then we had to be
 different so that nobody knew that there are three 
people of a family who wanted to have eggs or 
meat or bread, I don™t know
 any more what all, 
we had to stand in line. And -- but really for hours. 
Q: And now -- but your family was well off -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- and yet you still ha
d to stand in line? 
A: No -- yeah, nobody ha -- nobody h-had the possibili
ty. Someti mes we got from a uncle, from 
Mother™s brother, who was in the 
military, an officer, but that was 
not only in the war, he was by 
ch-choice for his life, you know, he went to m
ilitary academy and so on. Sometimes he came and 
brought us some thing special to ea
t. We had only one vegetable, fo
r instance, all that we got for 
without standing in line. It was ca
lled rote and it is a kind of beet. 
I still have the 
feeling, the taste 
of it, because  we ate every day this beet.  

Q: When™s the last time you had one of those beets? 

A: But no, I eat 
a little better. 
Q: But -- but you -- you haven™t -- 
I was asking you, I wondered if you™
ve had any of those beets 
since then. I bet you haven™
t wanted to taste them. 
A: No, never. Never. Never. I don™t know 
whether they are here, I really don™t -- 
Q: And you don™t want to find out. 

A: No, I™m - -  no, I™m not curious. 

Q: No. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
13 
 
 
A: It was really ec -- so that was very har
d. Then, we had no shoes, we had wooden shoes only, 
there was no leather. And I [i
ndecipherable] my feet very mu
ch with these wooden shoes, 
because they were so heavy on my skin. 
Q: So even pe-people or fa milies with means like yours -- 

A: Means. 

Q: -- was as -- as if you were poor. 

A: Yeah. Yeah, everyone was the same . That™s it
, we co-couldn™t get really enough to eat. It was 
very, very hard.  

Q: Do you reme mber going to bed hungry as a child? 

A: No, that I don™t reme mber, because we surely 
got the roten, the -- the beets. I don™t reme mber 
that I was -- went hungry. But not 
-- it was not a pleasure to eat, this was -- we t -- it was not 
much there to eat. Yes, anti-Semitisms I met for the fi rst time in Salzburg, that remi nds me. 

When we went to Salzburg, there was a horrid pape
r. It was called Der St urm, that means storm. 
And it was awfully anti-Semitic. And there it was written the fa mily fr om Albert Pollack, he was 

-- he had ma ny, ma ny things [indecipherable] a
nd he was high up, you know, from the -- to -- 

very, very appreciated, he was an
 [indecipherable] and he was very
 appreciated in Salzburg then. 
It™s hoefe is -- means -- it™s ar istocrats. And 
there was written the family fr om Vienna ca-came 
and eat and ate and ate, and they
™ve taken us a
ll the food away. 
Q: O-Okay. 

A: [indecipherable] accent whatsoever.  

Q: You were saying, taking all the food away. 

A: Food 

Q: The food away. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
14 
 
 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Okay. And that -- so, and that™s interesting 
because there were ma ny Jews in Vienna, but not 
very ma ny in Salzburg, right? 

A: There weren™t in Salzburg. My
 -- my grandfather, for instan
ce [indecipherable] his brother, 
his sist er to come. They were in Austria. 

Q: Oh, no thank you. 

A: But you tell me . 

Q: Okay, I will, thank you. 

A: Is -- they were in Austria,
 all, and he ask them to come  because he loved Salzburg. And I 
don™t know whether you know grandfather was a military
 in Sa lzburg and loved it, and then he -- 
when he got through with his military, he rented 
an apartment and a little shop. And then he was 
called to that  -- it was some -- I think some Ca
tholic high one who was in charge for Sa lzburg, 
and say, don™t you know, no Jew is allowed to settle
 in Salzburg?  You have to leave right away, 
and -- and leave your apartment and shop. So grandf
ather went away, and talked to the military 
for whom he worked -- not worked, for whom he
 was with, and they liked him very mu ch and 
appreciated him because he was a very good ma n. A
nd they talked to this archbishop or whoever 
he was, and he called grandfather and say -- sa id
 come . You are granted to live here, but you will 
be the only Jew. But grandfather di
d not si -- ma ybe you have it, gr
andfather, after a little while 
his sister came , his brother came and so on. And 
then came more and more and more Jews to 
Salzburg. And he was wonderful because he was 
fighting for everything. 
They had no rabbi -- 
rabbi there. Rabbiner in German. 
Rabbi is English, isn™t it? They had no rabbi there, he had to 
come . They had no kosher meat for people who want
ed kosher meat. So he had to -- everything 
to arrange. There was no temple, and when they wanted to buy some  acres to build the temple, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
15 
 
 
they were not allowed to buy it for that, for temples they were not allowe d to buy. Then -- but 
one Jew had grounds and said he want to build a te
mple there, and then it was permitted, if it is 
not on the side -- close to the sidewalk. It has to
 be farther back so that nobody is offended by a 
temple. Perhaps the Gentile would 
be offended if there™s a temple. 
Q: But they wouldn™t sa
y that about a church? 
A: No. Not at all, because as -- they were all Ca
tholic, of cour se. So -- but it was built. And that 
was hundred year old for -- two or three years ago 
when I went there. And so that was celebrated 
and grandfather was celebrated. All the time wa
s spoken about Albert Pollack, and I wa s so 
proud. 

Q: Well I™m -- I™ ve read a little bit about him in th
is chapter called Jewish life in Austri a, and it 
just says about him -- I don™t know
 if you™ve seen this, but -- 
A: No. 

Q: -- s -- he was -- ﬁAlbert Pollack opened his 
antique shop and eventually
 attained prosperity 
and respect in the city. He was sought after as
 a patron by ma ny associations. Then in 1872 he 
was the first Jew to acquire citizenship in Sa
lzburg,ﬂ as you just said. And then it says, 
ﬁMembers of the Austrian imperial family we
re among his customers, and Pollack was honored 

with the title, Royal and Imperial
 Supplier of Antiques to the C
ourt of His Majesty and Emperor 
of Austria.ﬂ 

A: Yeah. 

Q: That™s a pretty -- 

A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: -- good title.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444

A: He was very [indecipherable] and he was very liked as a person. For instance when Jews -- s-
strangers I shouldn™t say, you know, when people 
came who didn™t live in Salzburg, they were 
always invited for the holidays in the house of my
 grandfather and grandmother, alwa ys. So, they 
had only eight children, so it was really bu-bu -- 
nothing, and he was very well off, because he u-
understood a lot about antiques, a
nd the whole family loved antique
s, and had also -- ma ny of 
them had the s-s-stores, antique 
stores, and dealed with antiques.
 Two of my uncles and an aunt, 
and my mother. At one point, probably when Fa
ther™s business wasn™t so good, she had also an 
antique shop. Everyone had antique and of course 
the apartment had only antique furniture and -- 
because they all loved antiques. [indecipherable]
 Grandfather, who understood a lot, really.  
Q: Going to turn the tape over. 
End of Tape One, Side A 
Beginning Ta pe One, Side B 
A: So now we were at my grandfather and we 
all -- we all grandchildren loved grandfather 
because he was very gentle and warm and caring. 
We  had not the sa me feeling for gr andmother, 

who was a little colder , but very beautif
ul. Have you seen pictures of her? 
Q: No, I haven™t. 

A: I will show -- 

Q: What was her name , by the way? 

A: Caroline.

A: Wa s Caroline Pollack. I show you pictures afterwards.

A: I -- I get them now if you -- 

Q: Okay, sure, why not? 

A: -- you want. 

Q: We™ll pause for a mo ment. 

A: You know, I -- [tape break].  

Q: Okay, here we™re looking, and 
we™ve got the tape recorder on 
again, and tell me  what we™re 
looking at. I™m holding a thick postcard in my hand. 

A: My mother, who was the youngest of eight child
ren, and st -- that™s an aunt of mi ne, her 
sister, who was the oldest, with her 
two children when they were small. 
Q: Look at those hats. 

A: It™s th -- it™s this one, th
e girl, the little girl was si -- 
in concentration camp, and from one 
concentration camp to the next one, she went
. She really went through a lot, and -- 
Q: Is that Mimi ? 

A: Mimi , yeah.  

Q: Ah, I read about her, yes.  

A: [i ndecipherable]. And then her br ot her was a doctor in Vienna, but he co mmitted suicide 

when Hitler came. 

Q: Oh. 

A: By the way, I think he was baptized. I thi
nk. But oh -- ma ybe one didn™t know that he is 
Jewish, he -- and -- but he  committed suicide. But 
it is so adorable because it™s so old fashioned, 
isn™t it?

Q: We  have, just to describe this picture, 
you have the two wome n, who look very -- almost like 
twins, don™t they? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: They have the same  expression, but th
ey™re sisters, or -- or they™re -- 
A: No, ju -- they are sisters -- 

Q: They are sisters. 

A: -- but ma ny years apart. 

Q: Many years apart. They™re both
 sitting in what appear to be
 cane chairs, wooden chairs, in 
front of some evergreen 
trees, it looks like a -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- short needle pine trees on the gravel in fron
t of a house. There™s a li
ttle bit of a iron fence 
behind. And when would you say, Mrs. Karplus, 
that this photo -- photograph was taken? 
A: It was -- if I would be lucky -- no, it doesn™t say. 
Q: It doesn™t say on the back. 
A: In the back, but -- 

Q: What does it say on the back, it says -- 

A: Mimi  -- 

Q: Mother™s ca -- Kath Pollack -- 

A: -- was probably 10 years -- 10 years olde
r than I, so she would be how ma ny? 
Q: Tan -- Tante Irma on the left.

Q: S-She™s your cousin?   

A: She™s my  cousin. 

Q: Wa s she about your age? 

A: No, she was much older because I said, she was 
the daughter of the oldest of the sisters, and 
of the siblings, the eight siblings. 

Q: Uh-huh. So she would have been how
 much older than you, would you say? 
A: Older -- she -- at  least 10 years 
older than I was, 15 years, yeah. 

Q: So she would -- she would be
 100 today, if she were alive. 
A: Yes. Yeah at least. 

Q: So she would have been -- 

A: So -- and then is a -- 

Q: -- born in ma ybe 1895 -- 
A: Five, yeah, yeah.

show you afterwards 
Q: It looks almost 
like [indecipherable] 
A: This is my logo. 

Q: Uh-huh, okay. 

A: I don™t [indecipherable]. I have many more pi
ctures of [indecipherable] which I say -- 
Q: Okay, well ma ybe we can look at

me thing here. No, th-they™re negative. 
Q: No?  Okay, that™s all right. We
ll thank you for showing me  that. 
A: But I wanted to sh -- 
Q: Yeah, it™s very interesting. 
A: -- to show because I loved this as an old pictur e. 

Q: Uh-huh. Well, so you™re -- so y-you -- how of
ten did you go to visit y
our -- your grandfather 
Albert in Salzburg? 

A: Yeah, as a ch-ch -- small children we went al
ways summer and Christmas. We went always 
Christmas in Salzburg and in the hotel we lived, a
nd then for -- in summer we lived always close 
to Salzburg. [indecipherable] went
 with the -- first you had to wa
lk, and then you went with the 
trolley to Salzburg as children. 

Q: And did your father and mother 
come  with you to -- on these trips? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
23 
 
 
A: Father wa s very little with us in su mmer, because he worked in Vienna, and Mother was 
always with us, I mean, when we we re childre
n, and the governess was also always, or a French 
lady was -- a French governess. 

Q: A governess is like a -- what we call a nanny in the -- 

A: Yeah, yeah -- 

Q: -- governess [indecipherable] 

A: -- yeah, yeah. 

Q: And -- 

A: And then the French -- French lady was with
 us. I told you, we learned German very well. 
With us -- 

Q: And she was a governess also? 

A: Also, yeah, for us children. 

Q: Uh-huh. All right. And what was your fathe
r™s work?  You ma y have already me ntioned -- 
A: Father inven -- Father imported different te
xtiles, from Italy, and from Switzerland and 
probably from England because always came an English, a ve ry nice English gentlema n to 

Vienna, and that -- and came  to our house, I mea
n, for dinner. And he came very often. I even 
had to photograph from him -- him, i n my fo
lder, you know, my photograph folder where I -- I 
had to have pictures for my ex
a m. And he had the office in Vienna and my brother worked also 
with him, yeah, when he grew up. And he had al
so a -- a [indecipherable] associate who worked 
with him. And it was in Vienna too, that you 
came always home for lunch, for a long -- for a 
long hour, because Father, for instance, we were 
eating and then he always was lying down. And 
that was not only him who was ly
ing down, everyone in Vienna, all 
the parents were resting after 
lunch, before they went back to the office. Very
 few people, therefore, 
lived out of Vienna and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
24 
 
 
had houses, we all had apartments because to be
 close to the office. My husband, for instance, 
also walked off -- always to the office, and cam
e home for lunch. Lunch was our big dinner. That 
means the evening we had also plenty to eat, but less. So -- 
Q: Oh well, let me  ask you, i-in your father™s text
ile business, was this finished clothing, or -- or 
cut clot h that  -- that he was importing?   

A: No, only en gros, en gros that means the big [i
ndecipherable] of tex -- of
 textile, of material . 
Q: And they were comi ng from wher e? 

A: From It -- from Italy and Switzerland I am su
re, but now I thought also from England because 

one gentleman came always from Engla
nd, I remember, but I don™t know why. I don™t 
reme mber, so I suppose that he also impor
ted, you know, from England, some  ma terial. 
Q: Now, did he travel also to
 Switzerland, Italy, and England? 
A: Father? Yeah, yeah. 

Q: He traveled a lot. 
A: Father traveled, yea
h, traveled very much. 
Q: Now did you also -- did your fami
ly had property a-abroad at all? 
A: No. 
Q: No, just -- it™s just in Austria. 

A: We  didn™t have prop -- we had only in Vienna
, a -- a lovely apartment, looking over a park, si 
-- one, two, three, four, fi ve rooms in a row, 
looking on the park and then the living room and 
dining room were on the other side of the street. 
But it was really lovely to look, the view was so 
nice, and the balcony was to the park. 

Q: Now let me  ask you a little bit about Paris. 
What -- why did you decide to go there and what 
was it like when you got there for th
ose fo -- for those four years? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
25 
 
 
A: It was the first time that I left Vienna al
one and did -- afterwards I realized how good it was 
for me , because I was always the youngest Sporer 
girl, and the never -- th
e sister-in-law of the 
fa mous Dr. Felix Fleischner, I never had the feeli
ng I™m Erna Sporer. And in Paris, of course, I 
was in the first time  alone, the first time I wa
shed my own stockings and underwear, because I 
was a spoiled brat in Vienna, as we 
always had some body to do it. And I -- 
Q: Even during World War I? 
A: No, that was ak -- as -- a -- much later. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Of course, I went to -- ™
36 -- no, ™32 to Paris, and the -- 
Q: Uh-huh. No, no, but I mean y-you had people to
 -- to -- to wa -- even when you were -- 
A: Yeah well, all -- all the time -- 

Q: -- during the war you s
till had [indecipherable] 
A: -- also afterwards -- 
Q: -- this is --  yeah. 
A: -- we never washed our own laundry. 

Q: Uh-huh. So you™re -- yeah --  

A: But I need to -- I learne
d to wash my own laundry -- 
Q: All right. And you™re about 25 
years old when you went there? 
A: Yeah -- 

Q: It would have been ™32? 

A: -- 20 into ™30 -- ™32, 24 and a half. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
26 
 
 
A: Yeah, in summer I went there. And I was there three months, th -- I had only money for three 
months, so -- and I loved to stay
 longer, of course I had to ask 
for the permission of my parents 
because I was too young, I was 24 and a half. That was for Vienna young, and I had to get 

permission. And I went from one pho
tographer to the next one, wh
ether they want to have me . 
Finally, I found one who said yes, a German, if I 
type French, English and German l e tters. I said 
I™m willing to type, but I can only type with tw
o fingers. But you don™t have  to pay me  for the 
overtime, because I need to -- so I worked for h
im, and that was in spring, I reme mb er. And then 
I was very lucky, one day he was sick and so I 
had to go out to take a photograph, which was on 
a magazine on the -- on the top, how do you call it? 

Q: The cover? 

A: Of the cover. So I was very proud [indecipherable] 

Q: We ll, do you reme mb er which ma gazine it was? 

A: No. I think Vu, 
it was called. I think. 
Q: Like a news ma gazine, or -- 

A: A news ma gazine, yeah. 

Q: Do you reme mber what the picture was about? 

A: No, I don™t. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: And I worked for him, and then came  a friend 
to Paris, who was really a friend of my older 
sister, who was already ma rried at
 that time . And for him I was always the little Erna, but when 

he saw me  i n Paris I was grown up, and he fell in 
love with me . And he liv
ed in -- in Spain, and 
he say, please come  and t -- and it™s so beautiful 
in Spain, Madrid and so on. So I went to Madrid 
and spent also some  wee ks some whe r e on a beach, but alone. And I went on the beach and didn™t 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
27 
 
 
know, I saw always me n behind me . And then I 
learned one can™t go as
 a woma n alone on a 
beach, that means one invites the men. And I had no 
idea, of course. So of -- I stopped to walk 
on the beach alone, yeah. I had no -- I didn™t know that
. And then I went back to Paris and there I 
me t at -- my  phot -- [indecipherable] photographer,
 a very nice young lady, who also invited me  
to go boating with them and so on. And I wanted to
 start now with exercise
s to teach. So I looked 
for a place where I can rent it for one hour or so
, invited some people, invited some  people to 
watch, and so I started to teach exercises in 
Paris. And I earned enough money to live there 
comfortable, ma de very good frie
nds. And as I say, the French people were charmi ng to me , and 
very nice, and as I loved to teach, and always as
ked, every year when I came  back to -- before I 
came back in summer to the parents, I always sa
y please, can there be 
another year?  So I was 
four years there. I always had two mo nths atleast vacation, and then I™ve taken another studio 
again, where I was teaching. And then in -- four
 years later, in ni 
-- i-in ™36, my husband 
proposed that we should ma rry. So I always l
oved him, so it was easy for me  to say yes. 
Q: Where were you at the time? 

A: In Paris. He wrote me every second day, a shor
thand letter. His family, Karplus, always wrote 
only shorthand to each ot her, so I had to learn shor
thand before I left, butI wasn™t as fluent. And 
as he wrote me  every second day, I -- I was alre
ady -- the second day I wasn™t ready for the next 
letter. And so I went back to Vienna, but my pupi ls
 were terrific, when I said I will ma rry I got 
the most beautiful wedding gifts in Pa ris already, 
from my friends and pupils. And went back to 
Vienna and then -- 

Q: We re you ma rriedin Vienna? 

A: In Vienna. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
28 
 
 
A: Yeah. 
Q: With all your fa mily. 

A: A very small wedding. I mean, here everyone has 
it elaborate. I ha -- 
we had only the closest 
fa mily. 

Q: And was -- is he from Vienna, also, was he from Vienna? 

A: He, yeah. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: He was born in Vienna, and his father was a 
lawyer and my husband studied also law, but not 
to be a lawyer, only to be a good executive. To 
be a lawyer in Vienna 
at that time you had to 
study law, then to be seven years in a law firm 
before you™re allowed to be a lawyer, to open up 
your own office. But he never thoug
ht of being a lawyer. O -- real
ly he studied only law to be a 
good executive.  

Q: Oh. So -- 
A: And then he -- 
Q: Oh, let me just ask you, now yo -- when you 
-- you were married then in ™36 in Vienna. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: And your -- your parents were ha
ppy about -- they -- they liked th
at he -- that -- they all get 
along, uh-huh. 

A: Very mu ch. Everyone liked him. During the time
 I was away they were all the time in touch 
with him, and in fact he helped one of my sist
ers who had a -- opened a --
 for children, a nurser -
- nursery, and he helped her. They were always in
 touch with each other, 
and they all liked hi m. 
And then we were there til ™38.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
29 
 
 
Q: Now let me  -- before you get into ™38, let me  
just ask you a little bit 
about those years from 
™36 to ™38.  
A: Yeah. 

Q: First of all, what was it like
 being back in Vienna?  What was 
your life, your daily routine like, 
i -- did you work as the -- still ex
ercise teaching and photographer? 
A: Yeah, yeah, I was, yeah. Very little, but I di d teach exercise s.  

Q: And your husband -- 

A: -- and of course I have taken exercises, of
 course. I have taken 
acrobatic til I broke my 
collarbone. And -- a very leisurely life. I™ve 
taken courses at museum, and my husband had 
always when -- if he wanted tickets for theater
 for -- because he -- for his position, and he -- 
weekend we always were in the mountains, of co
urse, and I had a lovely time  these two years I 
was in Vienna, and then we -- we bought [i
ndecipherable] my husba
nd bought the beautiful 
apartment, and we had it all re
done with an architect, and the ar
chitect designed all our thing, all 
our furniture, and that friend who had the factory to
 ma ke furniture, ma de it, and we had a lot of 
friends and always I saw now in this little bookl
et, even after Hitler, always we saw friends, 
friends, friends in Vienna. They were for dinner 
-- of course we had the ma id and cook, so they 
were for dinner with us, we went for dinner to 
them. So we ha d the very social life, also. But 
Friday evening, which is the begi
nning of the Shabbes, we always
 have the whole fl -- all s -- 
four couples had to be at my parent™s
 for dinner. That was Friday evening. 
Q: Uh-huh, you had to be there, uh-huh. 

A: It™s -- our husbands didn™t appr
eciate this much, but -- but my pa
rents expected it, so we did 
it, yeah. 

Q: Yeah, it was just one of 
those family obligations -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
30 
 
 
A: That -- family, yeah, yeah. 
Q: -- that  every family -- 

A: Fa mily has -- 

Q: -- has, right? 

A: -- yeah. S- So should I tell you what my husband did? 

Q: Please, yeah, let™s talk about that. 

A: He -- he was the head of a big publishing house and that he  became, in Vienna it wa s called 

director, if you are the head of
. Here you call it publisher. Ther
e were five daily newspapers, 
then there we re six or seven weekly news
papers, and books were published. There were 800 
people and he was the head of it. He did not writ
e hims elf, ne ver, but he was the head of the -- 

chief editor and [indecipherable] of all the ones 
who wrote, and he, of course ha-had decided 
about the salary and things like that. Besides 
of [indecipherabl e] that he became in ™36, and 

therefore he  decided to ma rry, because he had a 
very high sa lary, and said now we can live ve ry 
well together, and I can take care of you. In Vien
na one ma rried only til the husband could take 
care of the wife. One didn™t expect to work -- th
at she was working. And so th-therefore, when 
he became the head -- he  was not the head first, 
he was under the di rector , I wa -- he wrote me to 
ma rry. And of course, when -- shou
ld I tell you now when Hi tler came? 
Q: Yes, you -- 

A: Or not yet? 

Q: Well, let -- let me just as
k you one more question about -- a
bout leading up to -- well, what 
was the climate there -- and I gue
ss this get -- leads into the 
question a-a-about when Hitler 
came, did you feel when you came back after four y
ears that the atmosphere, in terms of people™s 
attitudes towards Jews, and the anti-Se mitis
m had changed?  Did you notice a differenc e? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
31 
 
 
A: No, but I have to say that some  people were 
amazed that we -- that I went back to Vienna, 
because they were afraid what 
will be. And my husband -- my husba
nd said he n -- he would not 
leave his wonderful position, which was interesting 
for him, of course, and he would not leave 
voluntarily. But there was some  people who sai
d, why did you come  back? And for me  it was a 
good reason to come  back, to ma rry my husband. 
Q: We ll, what gave you the idea, or what was it 
that people said that gave you an idea that it 
wasn™t good to come  back? 

A: Said that -- that Hitler is in Germany, and so
mehow they were afraid that he will really c-

come  to -- also to Austria and so on. 

Q: And wha t  did you know about Hitler in 1936, and wh -- 

A: I knew -- 

Q: -- what we re you afraid of [indecipherable] 

A: -- that -- I knew -- I knew about Hitler be
cause I had friends in Germany, for instance. 
[sneezes] 

Q: Bless you. 

A: Excuse me. Who came to Paris to bring mone
y, that I take  care of mo ney, because they knew 

that they will eventually leave there. So I 
knew that in Germany it went on, but nothing is 
atrocities like afterwards. I had no idea. But I 
knew that Germany, he is against Jews, but they 
were not yet deported like later. In
 ™33, he started in Pa
ris -- in Germany. So people were what -- 
what -- probably afraid in Austria that -- and 
ask me  why I came back, and considered to come  
back. They were amazed. But, as I see, my hus
band said he would not 
leave voluntarily his job, 
his interesting job. And I loved to 
come  back to Vienna. I loved Pa
ris, of course, very much, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
32 
 
 
-- but I enjoyed to come back to Vienna because 
it was really my birthpla
ce, and where I spent so 
ma ny years. 
Q: Were there times during those 
years, from ™36 to ™38 before 
the anschluss that -- that you did 
feel uncomfortable or
 -- or frightened?   

A: No, I never felt fr ightened, and really it was 
a big surpri se, the -- when Hitler marched -- not 
he ma rched in, but the SS me n ma
rched in. It was a big surprise for all of us, and Schuschnigg, 
who was our president spoke on 
the television to say good-bye. 
Q: On the ra -- on the tel 
-- not the television, on -- 
A: Not televi sion -- 

Q: -- on the radio. 

A: -- the radi o. Excuse me. 

Q: That™s okay. 

A: Now it is -- television is so handy. No, it was on the radio that
 he said good-bye, he has to 
give in, he can™t fight. And th-that wa s a horror,
 of course, for all of us. It was a surprise. 

Some how one feared it, but it wa
s a surprise when it happened. 
Q: Tell -- tell me  about the -- the feeling that you reme mber, ma ybe, if you do reme mber the 

feeling at that time  whe n he 
rat -- actually came to power, and wh
at kinds of conversations were 
going on in your fa mily at that time . 

A: But in Germany was far enough for us, you k
now?  We  had also relatives in Germany, my 
mother™s sister and children were there. And -- 
but it was so f -- Germany was far for us, and at 
that time it was -- he didn™t start 
right away as horrid as he did afterwards. Even in Austria, I 
mean he started awful, but the horrid atro
cities came  later, mu ch later. And -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
33 
 
 
Q: Wh- Wha t -- what was it abou
t Hitler in 1936 and 1937, before Kr
istallnacht, and before the 
anschluss -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- that made you be fearful of
 him, or -- or -- or not --  
A: Yeah, not secure -- 

Q: -- certainly not want 
him to come  to power. 
A: -- let us say not sec --  

Q: Not secure, okay. 

A: -- not secure. But we saw -- we spoke very little
 about it, I have to say, and we were not really 

so much afraid of it that we e
xpected it. We  didn™t expect it. 
Q: Mm-hm. Right. 

A: But some  people were afraid of
 it. I mean, my family didn™t -- 
Q: But -- but you knew some thing about him.  
A: Yeah. 
Q: What was it that you knew about him?  

A: Just that  h-he™s ridiculously anti-Semitic, a
nd want to have only the bl onde, blue-e ye d people. 

Oh, I have blue eye. And that he want ed only to 
have won the race, that the Jews are impossible, 
that we™re all Jew. 

Q: And how did you know this, from reading the --  

A: We ll, reading, probably -- 

Q: -- just from reading the newspa
pers, or listenin
g to the radio? 
A: -- in the newspapers, yeah, yeah. 

Q: Okay. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
34 
 
 
A: I si -- don™t think we listed so mu ch to th
e radio as we do here now. I think we™re g -- read 
newspapers, and I had plenty newspapers 
at home from my husband, [indecipherable] 
newspapers. 

Q: So when the anschluss took place, when the N
azis came  to power in Austria, you said that it 
was a shock. What kinds of conversations was -- 
were you having with your fa mily at that time, 
once the anschluss st  -- 

A: What should we do?  Th-That was the first,
 everyone, what should we do, what can we do?  
That was the first reaction, of cour
se, of all of us. It was on a Friday evening and we were at my 
parent™s, but my husband was not yet there. 

Q: Was he still at work? 

A: A-At his work, at hi
s office, because two SS me n came . The mo ment they ma rched in, two SS 
me n went to the office, took my husband, with a 
letter addressed to Dr. Richard Karplus from 

Berlin to give his office to the two SS me n who 
hand him the letter. Of course they had no idea 
what to do. It was prepared already because
 the newspaper was important, a democratic 
newspaper, and so ma ny newspaper in his fi
rm who -- which came out, you know?  So everything 
was prepared from Berlin, that
 he should pa -- give over.  
Q: Because he was Jewish? 

A: Of course. 

Q: Of course, but -- but what -- let me  ask 
you a naïve question, how di
d they know on the day 
that they m -- took power in Austria that, pr
esumably ma ny other people including your husband 
were Jewish and -- and owned property or factor
ies, and they would ha
ve these letters ready. 
How -- how would they know that?   

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
35 
 
 
Q: I do -- that, I don™t 
know how they found out, but probabl
y newspaper was very important, 
because a newspaper brought the news, and they 
didn™t want  that it is against them, you know?  
That I can understand, that they re
ally had the aim to stop Jews to
 be at the top of newspapers, 
you know?  That was obvious, because the newspa pers give  you the news and they can be 
differently brought. 

Q: Now, when you say differently brought, do you 
mean like different kinds of perspectives 
depending -- 

A: Yeah, perspective, we  se -- 

Q: -- on the political --  

A: -- we he -- see -- see it here, how the republicans -- 

Q: Yeah. 

A: -- and the democrats [indecipherable] 

Q: We ll, did -- were there newspapers that 
were publishing ideas a
bout, you know, a Jewish 
conspiracy and these kind
s of things at that -- 
A: No, no, no. 

Q: So there wasn™t that kind of -- 

A: No, not at all. 

Q: -- Fascist -- 

A: Not at all. In the newspapers were the news
, I™m sure about -- aboutHitler, all these years, 
you know, that we learned about what™s going on
 in Germany, and -- but it was never in these 
papers how it was -- there was a single Jewish ne
wspaper, but I -- I don™t reme mber to have seen 
it, really, and so I don™t know. Bu
t I can understand that the newspa
per were in aim to stop right 
away to write how horrid Hitler is here, you 
know?  They wanted to avoid that -- this. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
36 
 
 
Q: So you mean -- you -- you were -- you™re saying 
that they did not want
 to write about how 
terrible Hitler was -- 
A: Yeah, see -- 

Q: -- because the Nazis were comi ng to power
 in Austria and they didn't want to -- 
A: Yeah, I mean -- 

Q: -- get thei r presse
s confiscated, or -- 
A: -- [indecipherable] the Germans didn™t wantthat the newspapers 
write badly about the 
Germans, and to influence people. 
So that -- so they were really 
anxious to get it out of the hand 
of the Jew. But my husband stayed still 10 days, 
because he sa id he is the captain, he -- the 
people, of course -- 800 people lo
st all their heads, 
whether they were Je
wish or not Jewish. 
Q: When you say they 
lost thei r heads -- 
A: Tha -- lost thei r head, that is
 probably German [indecipherable] 
Q: For -- for being -- lo-losing their jobs? 
A: Y-Yeah, not only losing their jobs, but that Hi
tler came  in. That we are no more Austria. 
Q: They lost their heads, 
they were -- they were -- 
A: We are no more Austrians,
 but not all of them, it was a mi xed group. There were many non-
Jews. For instance, the secretary of my husband. 
My husband called me  up at my parent™s and 
said, Erna, don™t walk alone at home. On
e doesn™t know what™s going on. I send you my 
secretary. And the secretary has taken, in the 
moment the SS men ca me to my husband, he has 
taken out the -- you know, h-he wa
s a Nazi. He was -- his secretar
y was in the party already, the 
Nationalistic party. 
Q: And did your husband know that? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
37 
 
 
A: No idea. But he offered to come  to take 
me  home , because he had the -- how do you call it, 
you know, the party insignia.  
Q: Was it a -- was it a swastika at that time? 

A: Yeah.  

Q: It was a swastika? 

A: Yeah, yeah.  

Q: For [indecipherable] 
Austria [indecipherable] 
A: And so -- and so he sent me  hi m, t hat he
 walks me  home . He was a -- very devoted to my 

husband, and that was again and again afte
rwards. Though you are a Jew, I love you. 
Q: So he was a me mber of the party, but he di
dn™t have anything agains
t you, at that time.  
A: No, not against my husband, he wrote us and 
-- afterwards. He -- because he appreciated my 
husband as a person, you know. And said -- but th
at was not only with my husband, one heard it 
very often. I love you, though you are a Jew. But t -- 
all the Jews are, of course, horrid, but you 
are not horrid. 

Q: When did you start hearing that kind of thing? 

A: After Hitler, of course , after Hitler . And also, 
I mean, I saw it with as -- a --  al so the secretar y 
was also not Jewish -- of -- of my husband. I™d sa
y all -- I™d say -- not all,
 but they wrote all the 
time to my husband afterwards, because a -- as a 
person they liked him, it was only bad luck that 
he was a Jew. And he stayed this evening very l
ong in th -- in the office, so to calm down the 

people, the reporters and everyone. And then he 
came home, and that I reme mber distinctly. It 
was very late probably, and we walked up a
nd down in the big living room, you know, what 

should we do, what should we do. And we were very
 lucky, we got -- we had friends in America 
who send us telegram whether we wa nt affidavit.
 We  got letters from Par i s from the lady who 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
38 
 
 
has taken over my studio, that my pupils want to have me  back, and I ha -- I have right away a 
job. The friends from Pa ris wrote me , they want tohave me  back. I wanted to go to Paris, but my 

husband, who was very intelligent, said, Erna, le
t us only once emigrate. Paris will be also a 
victim of Hi tler. And he was so right. So we t
hought about America, a little about Australia. But 
my husband read always English, and knew so mu
ch about Boston, for instance, so we -- we 
wanted to go really to amer -- we decided. And th
en I started to go to th
e different embassies to 
get the visas, you know, to get the visa to go to
 Fr ance, and to Switzer
land, to go through the 
different lands. And the French se
nt us an affidavit so we could 
really -- we could really go to 
America. 

Q: Okay now, let me  -- 
End of Tape One, Side B 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
39 
 
 
Beginning Ta pe Two, Side A 
Q: Okay, this is s-side A of tape two with Mrs.
 Ka rplus, our interview continues. Mrs. Karplus, 
you were just talking about emigrating to America, but
 I -- I™d like to back up 
a little bit to that -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- night that you and your husband were p
acing back and forth in the living room. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: And talking about what to do. I-I just want to
 ask you to r-recall as ma ny specifics about that 

as you can. I mean, did you suddenly feel like 
your whole world was going to be changed? 
A: Yeah, yes, yes. Of course. We  fel t  awful to leave our homeland, and we  were -- we were 

born, where we were so ma ny years. It was a horri
d s -- mo me nt to think one has to leave that -- 
we were in the lovely apartment almost not tw
o years, and ma de so ma ny changes there, and 
built lovely [i ndecipherable] there. And so many thi
ngs we did. It was an awful thing to think to 

leave, but the luckiest thing was that we were 
two. We  did it for each ot her. Alone, I would have 
been much more lost fo -- to 
do it for myself. But I 
had the feeling I do it for my husband and he 
did it for me , not to collapse. So we were rea
lly ve -- horridly, of cour
se, upset and unhappy. And 
what to do?  That was the 
big question for everyone. 
Q: Now, this was back in -- in March of 1938? 

A: ™36 -- ™38, yeah -- 

Q: ™38, March of -- 

A: -- excuse me , ™30 si -- yeah. 

Q: -- Mar -- March of ™38. 

A: March ™38. 

Q: And you also have -- had fa mily who were
 faced with the same  kinds of decisions. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
40 
 
 
A: Yeah 
Q: What other conversations were go
ing on in the fa mily at that time ?  
A: Yeah, everyone had the same  pr
oblem. How and where to go, and as
 fast as possible to leave. 
We were the first ones because the ot hers were no
t confronted right away 
with losing the job or  -
- or stopping their job. Also my brother-in-law,  who was a Roentgenologist, you know, he still 

continued to -- to see patients. 
And another brother-in-law was in 
a big firm, and he continued to 
be there. But my husband was really confronted, th
e first one of the fa mily to lose his job. But -- 
so we ma de -- right away tried to ma ke arrangement
s, but we were not sure what to do, really. I 
mean the -- because from the -- Paris, for instance, I got not the same day, I got the -- after a few 

days the letters, and we were
 not yet hundred percent deci
ded right away, where we go. 
Eventually we worked through that, that America 
would be the right place, where Hitler would 
not come . And my husband was right that he said let us not go to Pari
s. Many people went to 
Paris and went through -- or to England, for inst
ance, and were bombed there, I mean. So it was 
very clever of hi m to go 
-- to decide for America. 
Q: Let me  a sk you -- a-and I know some  of this mi
ght be painful me mories, but I want to ask you 
about some  of the specifi cs of -- of 1938, and 
how you felt, a-apart from your decision about 
where to go -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- which I-I™m sure you were thinking about a lot. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: What was it like living in Vi
enna in 1938, between the time that 
the anschluss started in -- in 
March, to the Kristallnacht in --  in -- 

A: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
41 
 
 
Q: -- in the end, in November of ™38. What -- 
what was it -- what wa
s it like th -- were you 
required to identify yourself as a Jew?  Did you ha
ve to wear one of the yellow badges, or -- 
A: No, not yet, because we left in June or July, ve ry early. 
Q: In -- in ™38 -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- or ™39? 

A: 30 -- ™38. 

Q: Oh, I thought you didn™t leave until ™39.  

A: No, we left very early because we were rea
lly f -- as I said, one of the first one who were 
confronted with it. 

Q: So you didn™t have to 
live through Kristallnacht? 
A: No, we were not there. Als
o, my si sters and brother not. Th
e parent s were -- were still in 
Vienna, I think, but not in their apartment. And we
 were no -- we left comp
aratively early. I have 
it in my book, I think  

Q: You have a little leather book that looks -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- about four inches by one and -- two inches -- 

A: [indecipherable]  

Q: This is 1938. 

A: We left fr -- Friday the 15
th
 of July at two o™clock. We  we nt 
to Zuri ch. So it was really early, 
you know?  The 15
th
 of July. We  were very lucky. For that
 reason we could take
 all our silver, all 
our furniture, everything with us, only not all mo ney. 

Q: They delayed your money. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
42 
 
 
A: We  got very little mo ney, but all our fur -- al
l we had, we could take with us. We  were not 
allowed to buy some thing any more. No -- nothing 
new, we could take. So, for us it was really 
short in comparison, that we 
were in Vienna under Hitler. 
Q: So from March to Ju
ne is only three months. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: What were those three months like?   

A: The three months, I™m a mazed that I see in 
my booklet how we saw every day friends, not -- 
at five o™clock, at seve
n o™clock, at nine o™cloc
k, we saw friends, friends
, probably we were all 
want to talk over what to do, I suppose. 

Q: And ma ybe you wanted to say good-bye to people, too? 

A: Also that, but that was not right away, but
 I see my husband had [indecipherable] the 19
th
 of 
March, and fr-friends came , fa mily
 came. So we saw a lot of people in this time, and I think 
really because we were also excited what -- a
bout the happenings, and what to do. And I went -- 
my husband went, I told you, the first 10 days to 
the office, got always in the evening some  
telephone calls with the -- they
 can put the -- now, how is it called, you said it before, the 
Hakenkreutz. Some times  people -- I have the hole 
in my head. Is it -- to take off de mocratic 
paper. Of course, my hus band say to everything 
yes [indecipherable] because he knew it doesn™t 
hurt him to forbid, you know?  And then came two 
people, two SS me n to our apartme nt to look 
whether we have s -- something against Hitler , so me
 literature or so. And in fact we had the New 
York Time s, where there was some thing, but
 they couldn™t speakEnglish, luckily. 
Q: When wa s this? 

A: That was probably nex -- everythi
ng in ™38, so ma  -- April, ma ybe. 
Q: Maybe April of ™38. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
43 
 
 
A: But the horror was, of course that -- was 
that they take my husband with them, you know? 
Q: What -- what -- 
A: They went through the whole apartment, in my
 -- my underwears, in 
the -- the -- they looked 
whether there is some thing hidden. They have taken 40 books of our books, which were from 

Jews, or Russian communists, and they looked ev
erything over. And as I say, we had always the 
Sunday Times, and in the Sunday Time s was some th
ing against Hitler, but they didn™t -- couldn™t 
read English, luckily. So they didn™t know. 
So they didn™t find anything, only these 40 books 
they have taken with them, and luckily they had to
 ha -- very heavy for s -- them to carry, they 
were very heavy. And -- but they didn™t take
 my husband, that was the big danger always.  
Q: And wh-why?  Did you see that happening around you, the people who si -- me n were 

disappearing? 

A: Yeah, for instance my  brother-in-law. 

Q: Say that again? 
A: My brother-in-law, who was in a -- in an office, he was also doctor 
of law without being a 
lawyer. He did the same  as my husband. To be 
a good executive, and he -- his boss wa s away in 
Prague, and when the SS -- 
Q: His boss was? 

A: In Prague, Czechoslovi
 --Czeshuls -- I don™t -- 
Q: Czechoslovakia, yeah, uh-huh. 

A: Right. And as the boss was not here, and he was 
next to the boss, the head of the firm, he c -- 
was taken to the police, the SS me n taking him to th
e police. And when my sister went there, of 
course they didn™t let him go. They kept him becau
se it was a Jewish firm, and the boss is not 
there, but he is representing th
e boss, so he was in the police.
 At that time it was only police, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
44 
 
 
there was not yet concentration camps, that we kn
ew. And my  sister went, of course, there. I 
slept in her house because she was, of course, 
awfully upset and unhappy. I -- I didn™t reme mber  
that I slept there, but I read 
it in my little book. And she had two litt
le children. And that was an 
awfully exciting time for my sister, and also fo
r us, what will happen with him. Eventually he 
was freed, and they went also, but we were the 
first one to live -- to 
leave Aus -- Vienna. But 
soon afterwards, my sister, who was ma rried with the Roentgenologist, and also my other sister 
[indecipherable] they left. My sister -- I know ve
ry little about my sister who was ma rried with 
the doctor, because I was -- 

Q: And her name ?  

A: Risa Fleischner. Dr. Felix Fleischner. 
And I don™t know whether you know Lynn. Do you 
know Lynn? 

Q: I know who she is, cause I™ve re
ad some  of her questions -- 
A: Who she is. And she -- 
Q: -- this is your ni
ece, your great-niece? 
A: Yeah, my great-niece, and she is
 the great -- grand -- she is the 
grandchild of my si ster Risa 
Fleischner. And her daughter, Lis 
says -- she lives in -- Lis Ro
senman, she lives in Ne w York, 
she says she knows a lot about. I admit I n -- I kn
ow very little how they went through, because 
we di -- were a lot with my sister whose hus
band was his -- at the 
police, you know?  That was 
the most frightening thing for us, 
what will happen to him. And I 
was, of course, also frightened 
the 10 days my husband went to the office, wh
ether he came home. If one of the 800 people 
could have said one word against my  husband, 
he would never be allowed to go home and to 
leave the country. But we were so lucky that no
t one person said anything against him. He was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
45 
 
 
very -- people liked him very much and he was a ve
ry fair boss. I mean, he was just as much for 
the worker as for the executives. So -- 
Q: And these were -- these were -- all 800 pe
ople were all employees
 in the textile -- 
A: Yeah. Not textile, in my husband™s -- 

Q: -- in the --  I™m -- excuse, not the textile -- 

A: -- the publishing house. 

Q: -- in the publishing, yeah, sorry. 

A: Yeah, the publishing house. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Yeah. And my father closed the office, and at 
that time  he -- he will -- had heart trouble, and 
he went to a kind of hospital [indecipherable
] sanatorium it was called, where you go after your 
operation to recuperate. That wa
s a wonderful thing in Vienna, when you were operated, to have 
a place where to recuperate where there were do
ctors and nurses, you know?  You didn™t have to 
stay the hospital as long, and go home. But you will go to the sanatorium. Here, sanatorium is for 

me ntal sick people, no?  But we calle
d it so -- like that. So F -- Father and Mother were there, and 
I -- that was a -- horrid, of course, for me  to 
say good-bye, because I didn™t know whether I will 
ever see them again. That was really awful. That
 was -- but you asked what we did in that time 
before we left. Number one, I had to go to the di
fferent embassies, and I had always to stand in 
line, because I was not the only one who wanted 
to get the visa for France and Switzerland. So 
that one had to have the permission that one pa
id all the taxes. One had to have it black and 
white that we paid everything and can leave the 
country. There were ma ny 
things like that of 
course, for the police. And one had to prove th
ings, you know?  And then wa -- we prepared, of 
course, to leave -- I mean, to -- e-everything has to
 be packed, and to decide what one takes or 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
46 
 
 
not. And, for instance, we  didn™t take the dini ng 
room, because we thought we will never have as 
big a -- an apartment again. And so it™s sad time,
 but what I wa s really amazed to see, how many 
friends we saw all the time , fa mily and friends, 
also. It -- it seems we 
were two hours there and 
then two hours there. That I di dn™t reme mber
, frankly, you know?  I only sa w it in my little book 
that we did.  
Q: So, e-everyone in your fa mily was -- most people in your family were thinking about leaving, 

you -- you talked about Risa a
nd is it Felix Fl eischner? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Yeah. And I saw from my notes, I 
guess from your grand-niece that -- 
A: Did you talk to my grand-niece? 

Q: No, I didn™t, but I™ve -- but I 
saw some of the notes that she sent to Arwen at the Holocaust  
Museum. 

A: Oh, she did, yeah. 
Q: Yeah. And she me ntioned apparently that -- th
at Risa and Felix went 
away -- fled Vienna in 
™38 also in a -- in a pl ane, in a little plane -- 
A: Yeah, we -- the all -- 

Q: -- to Switzerland? 

A: Yeah. The -- 

Q: You were all in together?  No -- 

A: -- yeah -- no, no. They went after us, but to 
the same  place we went, because we had a cousin 
over there, a cousin who lived with her husband in
 France, in Paris. I saw her a lot during the 
time. And then they were on vacation, this was summer, on vacation. Whether it is France or 

Switzerland, I don™t know. [indeci
pherable] it was in Milan [ind
ecipherable] and probably the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
47 
 
 
name  of the [indecipherable] I wrote down. Yeah. Th
at -- we -- we went there, and my ha -- no, 
my brother left the first one, because his wife wa
s pregnant and expected in August, a child. So 
he was the first one who went to Italy, because 
in Italy we had the -- he  had the business friends, 
really. And also he could ma ke business instead
 of from Vienna. He 
ma kes the business from 
Italy, from Milano. So he was the first one 
who left for his pre
gnant wife™s sake.  
Q: And that™s Agon? 
A: Agon. 

Q: Agon, uh-huh. 

A: Why do you ask? 

Q: We ll, I just have these notes he
re, I just -- I just [indecipherable] 
A: Yeah, he was Agon Sporer, my -- my na me , my born name , shp -- my family na me , Sporer. I 

had also my studio here, under my 
-- my na me  Sporer, Erna Sporer. 
Q: Oh. 
A: And he was the first one, really, who left. 
Q: Right, and -- and Risa -- 

A: And to -- 

Q: -- left, and you left -- 

A: -- we -- I -- th -- then -- 

Q: -- all that year -- 

A: -- I left, and then afterwards Ri
sa left, and afterw
ards Hella left . 
Q: And wha t  about your parents? 

A: My parent s stayed there in the apartment, 
and one day Mother said a-an SS ma n came  -- we 

called them always SS, a Nazi. Do you say Nazi here?   

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
48 
 
 
Q: Either -- either one, I 
think would [indecipherable] 
A: Yeah, came  and said, your husband has to come  w
ith us to the police. So Father had to go to 
the police, and was there. Of course that means 
overnight  in a -- in -- li
ke in jail. And Mother 
was, of course, horridly unhappy and said he has -- 
he™s a sick ma n with 
his heart and so on. So 
after a week, they said, if you 
e mpty your apartment, we can have your apartment in one week, 
we will give him fr ee. So Mother had to empty the apartment in one week, and Father  got fr ee. 

And then they lived with other families in an apartment. 

Q: In Vienna? 

A: Vienna. 

Q: They stayed? 

A: Yeah, that was -- but that was muc h later.  

Q: So the -- 

A: When we  all have left already. 
Q: But they were ther e until when? 
Or did they say the whole ti -- 
A: That I don™t know exactly, I kno
w only when they came here, but to -- my brother tried to get 
them to Italy, to Milano, but this was very, ve
ry hard to get them in. And t hen, after many 
months, I don™t know how -- unfortunately when, but it 
was surely we left in June, July we left? 
Q: I think you said you left July 15
th
. 
A: July, yeah. July 15, yeah, we left Vienna. It
 was probably Nove mber or December that they 
left. [indecipherable] 

Q: That -- that 
your parents left? 

A: Par -- my parents. 

Q: So everyone left in ™38 o-of your ma in fa mily. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
49 
 
 
A: Everyone, yeah, luckily. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And my parents 
were in Italy. 
Q: So -- but your parents lived
 through Kristallnacht then? 
A: Pardon?  

Q: Your parents lived through Kris
tallnacht?  They -- they were -- 
A: No, no, in Italy. 

Q: Oh, they were in Italy all -- by November? 

A: My parent s lived in -- because
 th -- my -- no, they -- no, they 
lived in Vienna, of course.  
Q: In -- in -- during -- 

A: And then they had to leave the -- the -- 
the apar tment in one week to the SS men. 
Q: Right. 

A: And then they lived with ma ny other 
people in -- in -- in an apartment. 
Q: Right. 

A: The Jews were put together. 

Q: But I was -- I was just suggesting that 
i-if they didn™t leave until December of 1938, 
Kristallnacht  was in November of 1938. Do you re
me mber them telling you about Kristallnacht? 
A: No, no, no, nothing. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Nothing. I am not sure that™s -- and unfor
tunately I am the only old one, my generation. I 
can™t ask anyone, because nobody is there. So I amnot sure when they left Vienna. I know only 

that they were then in It al y, a
nd we sent them -- peop -- fre -- people sent them an affidavit, and 
Mother went always to 
a consulate and it repeated about 15 times
 that the consul always asks one 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
50 
 
 
thing, that the affidavit giver 
has to do. And after 15 times the af -- the ma n who gave the 
affidavit said, here is enough. But the consul ask 
always Mother to come , it was far for her to 
come  to the consul. He was obviously an anti-Sem
ite and didn™t want the parents go to America, 
so he never asked 10 things at the same  ti me , no, one thing. A
nd she has always to come  and 
come  and come  and come to the consul to get theaffi -- to get the emigration. So one said he has 
enough, he can™t do any more. So we found some body el
se here in Boston, who were very nice, 
and then what I was -- e-every evening I came ho
me  after work and cried. That was all I could 
do for my poor parents who were 
there. I thought Mother is so ol
d, 60 years old, that she has to 
go through that, and Father was 74. So, it™s tha --
 for me  the idea was awful, these old, old, 
people. And a cousin of my husband ma rried an -- a ma rried lawyer who, when she met him in 

Vienna when he came to help Jews to come  out 
of -- of Vienna, and then they ma rried and he 
was very influential in [indecipherable] in -- 
in Washington. So when Mother came  one day 
again to the consul, the consul
 said, and whom do you have 
in Wa shington who has such 
influence?  And she got her affidavit. Only thro
ugh -- Alfred Shvetsky was his name . He was in 

the big firm you probably know, Sullivan and Cromwell in -- in New York. His father was one, I 

think, of the founders. So anyway, the parent
s came with the worst 
boat [indecipherable] 
prepared it, the boat -- about 
the boat I had the newspaper clip
ping, the Navama ri it was called. 
And there were hundreds and hundreds of people on 
it instead of 50 people. They were lying 
next to each other. It was awful. 

Q: Fro-From where to where? 

A: From Portugal to New York. Luckily we didn
't  know during this time , how awful this was. 
For weeks and weeks they were on the boat. 

Q: For weeks? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
51 
 
 
A: Nava ma ri was the name  of the boat. 
Q: No, the -- you -- they were on the boat -- 

A: My parents were on the boat -- 

Q: For weeks? 

A: -- because it was -- for weeks. 

Q: Why for weeks? 

A: They stopped in Bermuda, I know. Where el
se they stopped, I don™t know. They had very 
little to eat and drink, 
and there were very few bathrooms,
 and ma ny people got cholera. And 
they were lying one next to the other. And ma
ny people went to court afterwards. And I had an 
article, unfortunately I don™t fi
nd -- I also re -- wrote already 
for my grand-niece, for Lynnie 
about the Holocaust, because she wa nted to kno
w for her children, you know?  And I started it on 
vacation, and I can™t find it. I feel ashame d, but I 
can™t find it. I looked again and again for it, but 
I can™t find it. And there was also, I found a note,
 a newspaper note about 
Nava ma ri , how awful 
it was and -- in the newspaper. And afterwards 
ma ny peopl e went to court to get money for -- 
because it wa s so awful, the -- the -- the [indecipherable] 

Q: The boat? 

A: Yes, the boat, and how they 
were treated, horrid. When they ar
rived, they looked so bad that I 
thought Father will die on the way to the 
apartment. It was just that horrifying. 
Q: You -- you me t them at the -- 

A: At the -- yeah, I was in New York , I me t them 
at -- we all were at the port, we three sisters 

were at the -- at the -- to
 see -- to meet them. My -- 
Q: Do you reme mber the date? 

A: September ™41. Just before th
e wa r, we were in the war. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
52 
 
 
Q: Se-September 14
th
 -- 
A: ‚41 
Q: Se-September of ™41 you me  -- they didn™t come  until ™41? 

A: No, because the consul -- first we 
didn™t -- they were in Ital y, secure. 
Q: [indecipherable] Mm- h m.  

A: Then it started, my brother had to leave, becau
se it looked for the Jews, 
they were -- secluded 
the Jews in Italy also. So my 
brother left, and my parents. Th
en we started worrying. We didn™t 
start right away, we thought they are in Italy, 
in [indecipherable] and secure, you know?  And so 
it -- it -- S- September, and therefore, I was so
 afraid and so unhappy because I thought that soon 
we will be in the war. In ™41 December, and we
 were in the war. And so it™s -- I can give you 
some  ice in it. 

Q: No, no. No, thank you, no, that™s fine. 

A: No?  Don™t you want ice in it? 
Q: No, no, I -- really, 
it™s fine, thank you. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Or -- unless you want some  ice for yourself.  

A: No, I want only to be wet. 

Q: I know. Me, too. Now -- 

A: So the parents came  over, yeah. 

Q: So what was that like sta
nding there on the dock, waiting for 
your parents just to come  --  
A: It was awful, and luckily we didn™t know ho-how awful the whole trip was. That was -- we 

were really lucky, because to t -- 
to travel all the time, all the w
eeks, would have been awful. But 
I felt so sorry for my old mother, 60 years ol
d, and she became 99. Then she was little older. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
53 
 
 
Q: Do you -- do you reme mber what kind of reuni
on it was?  It must have been both happy and 
sad, huh? 
A: Ve-Very t -- very touching and af -- ab -- one, I 
think I went with Father into the apartment of 
my sister in New York, because 
Mother waited pr obably for -- with my other sist ers for the 
suitcases, and Father of -- was, of course, in 
an awful state, awful. Th-They looked horrid. And 
we sisters were so unhappy. It was really aw
ful. Am I excused for th -- for a mo me nt?  
Q: Oh, please, please. [tape break] -- to munch a litt
le bit here. We ll, so we were talking about -- 
and you were -- you were talking about the -- 

A: Parents [indecipherable] 

Q: -- a-about your parents journey. And I wanted to
 -- to go back a little 
bit again to those few 
months before you all left . 

A: Yeah. 

Q: What kind of preparations was everybody ma king?  
You™ve t-talked about it 
a little bit, but did 
you -- was -- was it -- wa s there careful planning 
involved in -- in deciding on how to book the 
trips, and how to get your -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- possessions out of the count
ry? How did you go about all that? 
A: We  found out that we can take
 a big van and all our things, as 
I said, which we have. We  were 
not allowed to buy stockings new, or anything 
new we were not allowed to -- to -- and our 
money was right away blocked in -- at the bank. 
And what was awful, of course, to go on the 
street, and to see that Jews have to kneel down 
and to scrub what™s an 
artist put paint on, and the 
Jews have to kneel on the street and to brush 
-- to try to brush them
 away. That w-was -- 
Q: You -- you s -- you were seeing this in
 -- right a -- righ
t away in ™38? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
54 
 
 
A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I don™t know whether it was ri
ght away, I can™t -- that I can™t say when it 
was, when it started there, but
 I saw it. And that  was awful, 
it was really heartbreaking, yeah. 
Q: Did you -- did you ever -- 
A: No, I never had it and nobody of my fa mily had to do it. 

Q: Why do you think that was? 

A: Pardon?  

Q: Why?  Why were othe
r Jews required to  
A: We  have -- a-as -- it happened to be then on th
 -- I wa -- we were luc
ky not to be on the place 
where they just gathered them, 
you know?  I -- I only pass them. Bu
t I mean, it was so that this 
was an awful, an awful sight. My time was not ye
t a concentrate -- that people were deported to 
concentration camps. That was not yet at that
 time. I don™t know when it started, frankly. 

Q: Although, wasn™t the -- the idea of -- did they 
call it Judenrein?  Wa s J
udenrein, or Judenrein -
- 
A: Ju-Judenrein wa -- were -- 
Q: -- the -- was that -- was that 
-- that was one of the slogans of
 the anschluss, wasn™t that?  We -
Were people -- do you reme mber 
that phrase th
en -- then?  
A: Yeah, yeah, people who were -- no. No, I don™t. This phrase I don™t reme mber. But you have 

to be completely Jewish when you had a Christian 
father also, and a Jewish mother, you were not 
allowed, I mean, to stay or to do things. That way 
if you -- of my sister He
lla St reicher, a brother 
of my -- of [indecipherable] Stre
icher, was ma rried to a Gentile 
li -- doctor. And they stayed 
there in Vienna. But now I reme mb er, he was once 
put also to the police and he jumped from the 
third floor down and broke several things. So he 
got to the hospital and su
rvived. But he stayed 
there, and the children were all brought up Cat
holic, because mother was Catholic. Not very 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
55 
 
 
religious, but they were. Of course, I mean, one ha
d a hard time  when one was half Jewish. One -
- then it was called Jewish. My 
brother-in-law, for instance, a
nother from my husband™s side, 
Hans Hartman, who was a -- i-is still -- he™s dead
, but he™s a very famous  psychoanalyst, and he 
had -- he had both parents at th
at time were not Jewish. The 
grandfather was still -- one 
grandfather of hi m was J e wish, but he had a Jewi
sh wife, a Karplus, so they had to leave.  
Q: What about your -- your -- 
I think it was -- was it your sist
er Risa whose -- whose husband 
was in -- in jail and then she ha
d to clear out the apartment? 
A: No, that was Hella. 
Q: That was -- that was Hella™s? 

A: No, to clear the apartment was my mother.  

Q: That was -- okay, I™m sorry, I™m getting confused. 

A: Yeah, yeah, no but -- 

Q: Now, you -- you -- 
A: -- it is hard, with my bi
g family, it is [indecipherable] 
Q: -- y-your mother had to clear the apartment 
and it was your father th
at everybody was worried 
about. 
A: My father was in the police. 

Q: Now, we re those -- we re thos
e -- what ha -- when she had to clear the apartment, what 
happened to all the possessions in the apartment?   

A: That was -- it seems she put it in storage, 
because it was then supposed
 to be [indecipherable] 
on the way to America, and they pretended that 
it was bombe d, but we all 
think it was pretended, 
and in reality they have taken it
. You know, one never could prove it. 
Q: They lost it. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
56 
 
 
A: Yeah, it™s lost.  
Q: [indecipherable] 

A: And they had the most beautiful antiques, ev
erything antique. And lovely
 things, but that  was 
all lost, so -- and my sister got my brother-
in-law out from the police without emptying the 
apartment, it was my mo ther. 

Q: Now, let me  ask you, Mrs. Karplus about y-you -- you had a lot of friends who were Gentiles. 

You -- you -- 

A: Lot is too much, say it™s -- but some. 

Q: Well, some. 

A: Yeah, definitely. 

Q: Now, w- were -- were any of those -- did you 
consider that you had close friends who later 
became sympathetic with the Nazis, or -- or  --  

A: No, no. 
Q: -- me mbe r s of the party? 
A: They not. Only the secretary of my husband. 

Q: So there™s -- that one story was th
e only experience like that that you had. 
A: Yeah, that have -- yeah. 

Q: And -- 

A: That has us wi -- were -- 
with us, continue with us. 

Q: They were -- they stood with you. 

A: Y-Yeah, yes, they were really good friends, 
close friends. And also [indecipherable] and then 
I told you two of the m have left also 
Austria, who were ma rried to non-Jews. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
57 
 
 
Q: Now -- an-and among the friends and associates of other me mbers of your fa mily, did th -- 
were there any other stories like
 that, of -- of people who had b
een friends who suddenly turned 
against them because -- 

A: No. 

Q: Nothing like that. 

A: I didn™t -- I didn™t hear of that. 

Q: [indecipherable] 
hear about that. 
A: I didn™t hear of that. And we 
were -- I think one aunt died in
 a concentration camp, that was 
burned. I mean, at -- in a concentration camp, be
c a use we didn™t hear anything any mo re. She 
had -- sh-she was a widow and she had no childre
n, and she was in Vienna very long. And, for 
instance, my  grandmother, who [indecipherable]
 she was in an old na -- old home -- no, no, for 
old people, you know, in a room, and died there. Bu
t one aunt, I think, died
 in the concentration 
camp, and that, with our big family, that was terrifi
cally lucky that -- becaus
e my friends here all 
lost so ma ny fa mily me mbers, and we didn™t. 
One aunt died natural course in -- in the 
concentration camp, and sa -- my cousin Mimi , I told you -- 
End of Tape Two, Side A 
Beginning Ta pe Two, Side B 
A: -- entration camp what she went thr
ough. Is there some body who can translate? 

Q: You know, I think if -- if
 we -- is this a copy? 
A: [indecipherable]. Yeah, that™s copy -- 

Q: I could send this copy to the Holocaust Mu
seum. I don™t read German, but I™ll send this. 
A: And somebody will there -- I ma de several, you know -- 

Q: Okay. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
58 
 
 
A: -- because I send it also to [indecipherable] 
Q: And this the letter to -- 

A: That™s -- this is -- 

Q: -- what is -- this says, mi ne inix -- 

A: -- inix -- ma  -- my be loved Aunt
 Ella, and all my loved ones.  

Q: Can you read just a little bit 
of it? I -- it™s too long to read 
now, but ma ybe you could read the 
first couple of sentences. This is 
written from the concentration camp? 
A: No. 

Q: Oh this is -- 

A: From Prague. 

Q: Oh no, no, yes.  

A: She was in Prague. 

Q: Reftele, Reftele? 
A: Oh no, I think she was in Prague 
already. She wa -- and I -- in ™63 -- 
Q: The seventh of October, 1945.  
A: And there is a second letter
, but I don™t know wha -- where it™s at, I don™t know. He wrote to 
my -- one aunt went to Ar gentine, and one uncle 
went to Argentine [indeci
pherable]. ﬁI can™t tell 
you my enormous pleasur e, I can™t describe it 
when I saw your writing, my beloved Aunt Ella. 
Finally, I found you.ﬂ I wou -- [indeci
pherable] I -- I -- I va -- ﬁI 
didn™t know where to look for 
you, but the world conquerors found my loved ones. 
When I read your letter, I had a -- v-very 

much to cry, because it was also still addresse
d to my beloved mother, but I will tell you in 
shortﬂ -- as you say, in short -- 
ﬁin short sentence, my life what 
I had to go through. Mother and I 
were in July 1942 deported to Theresienstadt.ﬂ Th
ey lived in Prague in Czechoslovaki a. ﬁWhen 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
59 
 
 
we -- when we arrived there with the transpor t,
 all our -- our suitcase we
re taken away. Only 50 
kilogram we  had, with the most i mportant things
, but we never saw it agai
n. I worked as a nurse, 
and I worked very hard so that I didn™t -- so th
at weﬂ-- because her mother lived there -- ﬁthat we 
didn™t have to come  in another the -- to Poland, in 
-- in -- to tra -- to be 
transported to Poland. So 
Mother and I were all right. Then
 I got an awfulﬂ -- you don™t say 
angine in English, sore throat, 
but it is with an abscess -- ﬁa
nd with 40 grade fever,ﬂ that me an
s 104 or five. ﬁAnd Mother ha -- 
Mother got an ear inf-in
fection, and her ears was very painfu
l, and the doctor calmed me, said it 
can be only -- be taken care in the hospital and Tu
esday early -- it™s one of the specialist doctors, 
they said that see that she has 
an infectious -- infectingﬂ [indeci
pherable], it™s in 
the -- God, this 
is hard for me  to know. ﬁThe brain infection. So
me  brain infection. And th
ere is a little hope if 
one operates. One has to open the head, and durin
g the operation one saw that the head was f -- 
full of pus, and there was no hope for her. Tu
esday evening, at 10:30, November 17, 1942, sh -- 
is my much beloved, good mother passed away. It is
 one -- it is very good, 
they said she was not 
conscious and f -- the good God has 
at le -- didn™t let her suffer 
long. My darling mot her cames -
- is [indecipherable] in the crematorium, burne
d, and I hope that I will get the urnﬂ -- do you say 
urn?  -- ﬁwh-when -- when I come  home , so -- so 
I can bury her with my brother, Bela. I am -- 
afterwards is I have four -- a 
40 fever,ﬂ -- that means 104 or some
thing -- ﬁduring the sickness of 
my never to forget mother, the -- I was wa -- duri
ng the sickness all day and night I™ve taken care 

of her, I™ve nursed her. So -- I got
 so awfully sick me ntally about 
the horrid loss, th
at I had to lie 
down for three months and I couldn™t -- I couldn™t
 get better and I didn™t 
want to get better. 
Everyone told me that it would be an mi sery, an
d one ca -- one can™t change this mi sery, and it 
was surely not Mother™s intention mi s -- that I wa -- I-I was so bad off, and I tried to get better. 

So I stayed til December, but I fell from the bed 
because I was in thisﬂ 
-- up, you know, it™s sert -

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
60 
 
 
- up, you know?  It™s [indecipherable] she said. ﬁAnd 
I™ve got better and I wo
rked very intensely. 
Then again the transports.ﬂ -- do you see transport?  ﬁIt started in September to [indecipherable]. I 
got in such a transpor t, but in the last mo ment
, one had taken me  out. Later -- later it -- there 
were no excuse any mor e , and so I had, in December
 n -- I was in the -- sent the -- to the -- it was 
called death -- death la -- death pl
ace. Auschwitz, I was there -- I was -- that™s what is there. I 
had s -- through seven more months da-daily I 
saw the death -- I face th
e death, and a -- and I 
expected i -- myself to get into the crematoriu
m, but I was lucky and ha
d to clean -- to ma ke 
clean and went to Hamb urg. All th
ese trips [indecipherable] with 
-- with my mother, and I -- to 
Theresienstadt, we ma de in a wagon for animals.
 It was a horrid, daily by day and night, very 
bad bombar d me nts.ﬂ Is this right?  Bo mbardment ?   

Q: Bom- Bombardments , yes. 

A: Bo -- yeah. ﬁ We thought always to be killed
 by the bombs . I was three months in Ha mburg, 
then close to [indecipherable] there -- there we
re ma ny bombs attacks in 
our concentration camp, 
and so I -- during the time  I worked, I lost ag
ain everything. I did not 
have soap, no toothbrush, 
nothing, only the -- only I had the very bad what 
I had on -- on. Then we had to go away from 
there, and after two weeks again in a wagon fo
r animals, 120 people in one wagon, were always 
te -- every day some  dead. We  had to stand withou
t eating, water, without water in a very badﬂ -- 
oh, some ti mes it™s so hard, you know, [indeciphe
rable] ﬁwe were in [indecipherable] and 
physically we  were -- we came to the very badly 
-- a very known for bad, Bergen-Belsen. It was 
a -- it was known to -- to the -- for that to -- th
at people die there. I can
™t tell you, my loved ones 
to -- what I went through. H
ungry, thirst and lice. We  were
 sleeping on the -- on the earth 
without any cover, all cl-close to each other 
through four weeks. No piece of bread for ma ny 
weeks, no water to wash, and if it™
s -- was alright, very seldom a 
water soup with beets. That was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
61 
 
 
all -- in all the concentration camps our daily me
nu. The people were all so down physically, that 
hundred died every day.ﬂ Do you want to continue?   
Q: Well, I think -- 

A: I™m sorry I -- 

Q: No, no, this is interesting, but 
I -- I think I™d like to ask you 
a little bit about -- I mean, cause 
probably we don™t have time  to read
 the whole let -- the whole thing. 
A: No, and because I™m also not pr epared to [indecipherable] 

Q: No. No, no, th -- but this 
is -- this gives a -- a -- a 
feeling of a terrible time. 
A: Yeah, a better idea that [i
ndecipherable] happened horrid. 
Q: What -- what do you -- what do you recall fr
om having learned about Mimi ™s experience?  
What -- in addition to what 
you™ve just read, I mean -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- what kind of hell that she lived through. 
A: She was very bad off. She had tuberculos
is afterwards. And she had broken her arm, I 
reme mber. I went in ™63 the first time to Europe, 
but I went to see her in Prague, and she was in 
very bad shape. 
Q: This was at -- so you hadn™t seen he
r since -- when was the last time -- 
A: The last time  I saw her later because a cousin 
of mi ne invited her to Austria. They could get 
out of Prague when somebody guaranteed to take
 care of them, and so Mimi  was lucky, through 

me, she -- the fa mily learned then how she is in 
Pr ague, and my cousin who lived in -- close to 
Salzburg, at that time, invited her. So I saw her th en also there. But I ha
ve sent her I don™t know 
how many packages, care was at that time, care p
ackages we called it. And she always asked me  
for things what she could sell. For ins -- lipstick
s it seems we re not in Prague and she could sell, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
62 
 
 
and for that she could buy what she wanted to, 
food or whatever. And when I was in Prague in 
™63, there were still the communist
s. One person -- Mimi  called for me  at the airplane, and also 
one communist -- one official. A
nd then I was in a very good hotel and got everything beautiful 
to eat and the people outside were
 standing in line to get somethi
ng to eat and had no-not a tenth 
of it. So of course I invited ma ny friends of Mimi
 and Mimi  herself. And I was horrified that in 
the hotel they offer everything wh
at you want and the outside the 
poor people didn™t, and they -- 
in the trolley car one heard -- one woma n hear
d us speaking German, so she came over and -- 
and said how horrid it is to live 
through all this with th
e communists. So I was at a very bad time 

in Prague at that time, but I s --
 really did my best to help Mimi
. At that time I didn™t have much 
money, but at tha -- my husband died 
already in ™58, so I was alone.  

Q: He died in ™58? 

A: Yeah. But -- 

Q: So -- so Mimi ™s story is 
really a story of survival. 
A: Yeah, it™s unbelievable. It™s unbe
lievable that she survived.  
Q: What do you attribute that to? 

A: I don™t say what I think. [tape break] 

Q: So we erased that part. 

A: Yeah, but that is my m -- 

Q: But y -- 

A: I never talked with 
some body about it, you know? 
Q: Yeah. Well -- 

A: And I always thought, I mean, she was not a 
very beloved cousin, I have to say. And my 
cousin in -- of Salzburg was very decent to invite
 her. And it was very 
interesting, th
e little she 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
63 
 
 
[indecipherable] there, it was Lynni
e and her sister Debbie, they were small. They only liked my 
cousin who lived in the -- there, but they didn™
t like Mimi . That was so
 interesting, the children 
had the instinct. But I felt so sorry for her, I mean -- 
Q: Of course, yeah, I can understand that. 

A: We ll, a horror to go through all that. 

Q: Do you -- a-a-and her brother wa
s the other one in the picture? 
A: Yeah, and who committed suicide when Hitler ca me . He was a doctor. 

Q: What -- what is -- what is 
the story -- tell -- what do you know
 about that story?  When -- was 
this in ™38, right away after the anschluss? 

A: Yeah, right away, right away. 

Q: What do you know about that? 

A: We ll, I don™t know, but we thought, the family 
thought that he was baptized, he was baptized, 
I think and didn™t want that they
 find out that he is a Jew. I 
think, but we don™t know really.  
Q: What -- what was his name again? 

A: Bela. B-e-l-a. 

Q: B-Bela.  

A: Bela. 

Q: His last name  was? 

A: Herz, A -- H-e-r-z. That means heart. 

Q: Bela Hertz. 

A: Herz, yeah. No, Hertz one writes w
ith t-z, and they are only H-e-r-z. 

Q: Okay. And -- 

A: And Mimi  was not ma rried. She was once 
married, got divorced, but very short.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
64 
 
 
Q: So -- so he -- so this is ma ybe a story of 
Bela as some one who was discover -- he was afraid 
he was -- be discovered as a Jew. 
A: Yeah, I thought. I -- that was -- 

Q: So he was ma ybe ma king adjustme nts for his 
own survival by trying to deny his identity to 
some extent. 

A: Yes.  

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Yes, I thou -- that is what I assume , but
 don™t know, you know?  And he was buried of course, 

there, but I don™t know it. 

Q: We ll, let me  ask you, Mrs. Karplus then -- we™r
e jumping around in time a little bit here, but I 
wanted to ask you one more thing about just as 
you were leaving in ™38. You went to Zurich 
first, you said? 

A: Yeah. 
Q: Who -- 
A: No, my brother was 
first  [i ndeci pherable] 

Q: No, but I mean, but -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- you -- you first went to Zur -- I m
ean, in other words you -- your first -- 
A: I we -- we  went to Zurich, yeah. 

Q: -- destination after Vi
enna was Zurich, and -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- can you recall the de
tails of the day that you left and ho
w you traveled, and what it felt like 
at that time? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
65 
 
 
A: It felt -- of course, I don™t reme mber exactly, 
but it felt -- I know that
 it felt awful to leave 
your homeland, and to go into an unknown country. America was so far at that time for us. We  
had an uncle I reme mber who ca me once from Am
erica. Oh, he was in America. You know, that 
was, really for us, so far. At that time we went al
so with the boat ther e. We were lucky, with the 
Nor mandie we went there from France to Ameri
ca. But flying was not yet there. Telephone was 
not yet between there, so it was really in an 
unknown nothing. But we were lucky that we had the 
friends here where we could live the fi rst week, so
 that was very lucky -- in New York. We tried 
first New York. My husband tried first to get the 
job in New York. And I got one right away at 
Rubenstein, because they knew me  from Paris. 

Q: Did -- did you -- but it was ™38 that
 you went to Zurich and -- and -- 
A: Yeah [indecipherable] ™38. 

Q: -- tell me  how long -- how long did you stay there? 

A: Where? 
Q: In Zurich?  
A: In Zurich, s -- very short, be
cause we went to my cousin, who lived in Paris at that time, and 

then in -- in -- close to Salzburg.  

Q: Oh. 

A: And she was with her husband on vacation fr
om Paris and s -- and invited us to come . 
Q: And how long did you stay there? 

A: I stayed there about two week
s. I don™t think that I have it here, where we -- when we g -- 
went to -- my husband, I know went with na -- th
e [indecipherable] cousin to ma ke arrangeme nts 
for the going. In [indecipherable] I know we were
 in -- in August we came -- went to America 
and -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
66 
 
 
Q: So it was August of ™38 that you -- 
A: Yeah, ™38, yes. 

Q: So you only -- you we re only  

A: [indecipherable] one month. 

Q: -- in Zurich and -- and Paris fo
r -- for ma ybe a total of a month.  
A: Yeah. [indecipherable] in
 between, we were there. 
Q: Those two?  Oh.  

A: Yeah. Not -- 

Q: They -- 

A: The most  a month we  were.  

Q: And wha t  -- 

A: Maybe we ma ke -- we started -- we arrived 
ma ybe beginning of August 
here. I always said 
we are not a May flow
er, but August flower. 
Q: You were on the August flower. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: And what was the trip like to the United Stat es? 

A: Wonderful, the Normandie. Yeah, that was such a wonderful boat, and so good to eat. And we 

didn™t want  to talk to all the immi grants. 

Q: Why?  

A: We talked not Germa n to each other, I thi
nk, we talked French or English, I don™t know any 
more. 

Q: Why?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
67 
 
 
A: Bef -- we didn™t want to hear
 from everyone the mi sery. Ther
e were so ma ny peopl e, so poor, 
you know?  Everyone lost some body, we were so lu
cky that we didn™t lo
se people, you know?  
And there were so ma ny people who lost [indeci
pherable] the concentration camp, they didn™t 
know what happened and so on. And we didn™
t wa nt really to talk to everyone. 
Q: I-It™s -- at this time in ™38, of course
 it wasn™t as much loss around you as y-y -- 
A: No, but sti --  

Q: -- at that time, but -- 

A: -- no, tha -- you™re right, at that time  nobody wa
s still concentration camp, but everyone felt 
mi serable, of course. 

Q: Yeah -- yeah, and you -- ma ybe you just di
dn™t want to think about it any more. 
A: We  -- I didn™t, yeah, yeah. And we -- my hus
band and I decided we never talk about Vienna, 
how would it be now to be in Vienna. We  never ta
lked about it, so not -- 
so to get used to the 
American life, to assimilate here and not what we 
lost. We  didn™t talk what we lost, we wanted to 
ma ke our new life here.  
Q: So you just stopped talking about it? 

A: About, yeah, we didn™t talk. Now we -- we would be this [indeciphe
rable] now we would 
have the party, now we would -- we 
never talked about what we lost. 
Q: But what -- what -- what a
bout in 1940 and ™41 and ™44, and wh
en the -- when the details of 
the Holocaust started comi ng out
, did you talk about it then? 

A: That -- of -- then, yeah. Then of course, we 
talked about the Holocaust, but not what we, what 
we lost, what we would have n-now in Vienna
. The money, t he positions, my husband never got 
the position here, a decent. So, we were so oc
cupied with here, and wanted to be here. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
68 
 
 
Q: Right. Did you -- did you ever talk about what
 it -- would have happened to us if we had 
stayed? 
A: No, it was clear. 

Q: You didn™t need to talk about that. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: I don™t reme mber that we talked about it. We  
-- we surely talked about how lucky we were to 
come  out, and specially with our things becau
se we couldn™t buy a bed or anything, you know?  
We had no money. 

Q: But you -- you left quite 
a bit of money behind. 
A: We  -- yeah. 

Q: Can you say about how much, or -- 

A: I have no idea. 
Q: But it was -- it was su
bstantial amount of money. 
A: But it [indecipherable] yeah, yeah.  
Q: And so how did you put your life back toge
ther financially here, when you were here? 
A: I got very soon a job at Rubenstein, Helena
 Rubenstein, you know, ha
d a salon in New York. 
And she knew me  because I was teaching her 
si sters in Paris, so she knew me . And I 
[indecipherable] 

Q: [inaudible] 

A: I worked there, you know, and then my husba nd, 
we were told that he should take the first 
job, whatever it is. So a friend of ours worked in 
a store, and wa s asked whether he wanted to go 
with a couple to Canada and tuto
r children, high school™s children. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
69 
 
 
Q: And -- and what the children? 
A: High school. 

Q: Tutor -- tutor. Tutor the children. 

A: Tutor. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And this young ma n, Eddie, didn™t want to go,
 so he asked my husband and my husband went 
to Canada for two or three months wi th an 
American couple and was tutoring all Latin and 
French and ma the matic, everythi ng, and skiing, 
because he was a very good skier. The only 
thing he said he didn™t know was, when he wa
s asked when friends came in and he helped to 
prepare, you know, the drinks and so, when he
 was asked for a Manhattan. He had no idea how 
to do mi xed drinks because we never had them 
in Vienna, you know?  And then they came  back 
and we hoped through his -- that ma ybe there is a c
onnection that they will get some  job for my 
husband, but they got it only for me . She knew some body ﬁ V ogueﬂ, at ﬁHarper™s Bazaarﬂ, and 
that was a wr ite-up about me , and I got some  pr
ivate lessons through this
 write-up. So I earned 
faster than my husband. And -- but then this co
uple went away again, I don™t know where, and 
offered us their apartment for three months on Park
 Avenue. So we didn™t have to rent -- to pay 
rent, we lived there for three months. And then we
 went back probably, to a rented. But after one 
year, when my husband couldn™t find a job because 
the publishers say you ha
ve no experience in 
America. A small job we can™t give a ma n lik
e you, and a high job you can™t get because you 
have no experience. 

Q: So they were saying he was overqua -- 

A: My husband would have gone everything, he 
would have done I don™t know what, to rub the 

floor, I™d -- anything, only to prove -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
70 
 
 
Q: But they -- they said he was overqualified for the lower positions? 
A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: Right. 

A: And he always loved Boston, and in fact, he 
[indecipherable] he paid very intelligently, not 

only storage, went to New York, but also to Bo
ston, he paid in Vienna, because what he read 
about Boston he loved always. Close to the mount
ains, academic place, so -- so -- and my sister 
and Felix Fleischner were already in Boston. So
 he went ahead, and we went Boston. I asked 

Rubenstein, she had the salon here, to transfer me
. I worked at Rubenstein and he looked for a 
job. 

Q: And -- and when -- when was this, when did you arrive in Boston? 

A: One year, ™39. It was in ™39, ™38 August we 
came, it was probably September, October ™39, I 

don™t know. 

Q: So that you were in New York about a year? 
A: Yeah. 
Q: And whe r e in New York did you live? 

A: We lived -- fi rst we lived with
 a friend on Central Park We st, then we rented, also in the west, 
close to Columbia [indecipherable]
 an apartment, and hert -- the 
-- there was h-high-ups, the s -- 
subway, the -- not the su -- the tr
olleys were awful noisy, but we 
got used to it. Then my husband 
went, I stayed alone in this apartment. Then we
 were three months in Park Avenue with mi ce, 
and then probably we went back, that I don™t 
remember now, and mo -- probably went back to 
the west si de because that was the cheapest at that time. 

Q: Ha -- and -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
71 
 
 
A: And -- and in New York my husband didn™
t get a job, but here he got a job, and 
[indecipherable] in a very disa
greeable job in wal -- Wa ltham or Watertown. He had to sell 
watches which are very bad and cheap. And for him 
to sell, to know it is bad, he suffered awful. 
It was awful for him. And then he had different 
jobs, but never a real in
tellectual job as he had, 
you know?  
Q: So it mus t  have been unhappy for him in some  ways. 

A: Yeah, he was very well balanced ma n. He 
we nt home and read, you see all the books we 

have?  This is his books. He read 
and [indecipherable] away. And ev
entually he prepared all the 
dinner for me, and pre -- eventually he washed 
the -- he wa -- washed the linen, or laundry, 
because I worked long hours. I worked before R
ubenstein, after Rubenstei
n, and after four years 
I left Rubenstein and finally we agreed that
 I risk to have my own st-studio. But nobody knew 
anything about exercises at that time. That 
was ™41, I got my [indecipherable] four years 
[indecipherable]. I think ™41, I star
ted to -- to look for a studio, 
which was also very hard. Very, 
very hard, because I ma ke noise. People jump, wal
k, noise. It has to be in a region where people 
can park. It was Tremont Street
 at that time , all right. Because now I wouldn™t be on Tr emont 

Street, but at that time it was all right. And 
it was very funny, there wa
s -- it was for the Young 
Man Christian Association, a house. And I ask -- I ta
lked to the director 
and said, I look for a 
place, but we have only money for three months 
rent. I don™t know -- if I don™t get pupils, we 
can™t pay, and wa -- I have to move. And in f
act, the purple -- the person who was there before, 
she left without paying. But he believed me  and 
has taken me . I was then 15 years there, because 
I worked up, you know, to pupils more and more 
and more and more. And I never advertised. I 
get them all -- got them only recommended. And th
at was the wonderful 
thing, you know, not to 
get from the street anyone who s mells or expects wonders. So, my pupils suit me . 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
72 
 
 
Q: Mm-hm. Let me  change tapes here, and ju
st wanted to ask you a 
couple more questions. 
A: Then I can -- 
End of Tape Two, Side B 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
73 
 
 
Beginning Ta pe Three, Si de A 
Q: -- with Mrs. Karplus. This is the side A of 
tape number three, and I just wanted to ask you a 
couple more questions. I-I -- I want to ask 
you how you kept in touch with you -- you all left 
your fa mily, your fr -- -- your -- 
your parents. You were all toge
ther in New York, in -- but -- 
A: Yeah, first we were all to
gether in New York. My -- 
Q: S-So you were --  
A: -- the three sist ers. 

Q: So you really kept in close contact with your fa mily? 

A: Yeah, with my sisters. My brother was in 
Brazil, of course, and -- during the war it was no-
not possible. But my mot her went 
first to him when his wife died i-in Brazil. And otherwise, we 
three si st ers were close because one st ayed in 
New York, Hella and Richard Streicher with their 
children the -- my sister Risa and 
Felix Fleischner were here, they 
were only for a shor t time in 
Greenfield, but they came back because he got the j
ob in the Beth Israel hos
pital, to be the head 
of the departme nt, the [indecipherable] departme nt
. And he is really a famo us ma n because there 
is all over the world an associ
ation called Felix Fl eischner Association, which meet once a year 
and there are, from all over the world the people 
come , the doctors -- it is for the chest, lung, and 
they come , also surgeons and so on, and there 
are some who give the 
lectures. And there are 
hundreds and hundreds of doctors who get together
, and I™m very proud that it is called Felix 
Fleischner lecture -- lectures, or
 association. And in fact, there 
is also, here in Boston once a 
year, called the dinner for Risa and Fe lix Fleischn
er and they give some  
prizes to the best young 
people who do research for x-ray. So, I always
 say I™m surrounded by fa mous people, really. 
Q: And did you keep in touch with 
-- with your brother in Br azil? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
74 
 
 
A: Yes, yes, and then the first time when he ca
me with his daughter, we 
were awfully excited, of 
course. But th -- it was already 
-- the daughter was already about 
14 years old, so we hadn™t seen 
my brother for a long time . We ha
d no money to go there, and we 
-- and he probably also not. So 
when he came  with his daughter, we  were very, 
very happy and excited, r
eally. It was wonderful. 
But luckily, that all close -- also for my husba
nd that the siblings, everyone came out, and that 
was a wonder. Wa s really -- when so ma ny peopl
e who were [indecipherable] no?  And had to go 
through the concentration camp, and 
only my cousin Mimi , who -- 
Q: And even she survived. 
A: -- went to the concentration camps.  

Q: That™s -- that is a -- an amazing 
thing, isn™t it?  I mean you must not -- 
A: Mm-hm, very. Very, a
nd lucky. I mean, so lucky. 
Q: Do you ever think about how could this 
be?  I mean, you™re -- you™re -- so ma ny people 
around you an-and so many other Jews a
ll over Europe perished, and -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- and your fa mily -- 

A: Was so lucky. 

Q: Did you ever try to as -- attribute that to a -- 
a greater power or -- or any s -- fate, or any --  
A: No, because we started early. 

Q: Because -- 

A: The people -- that ma de a big 
difference, it -- we star -- we 
started early, before people were 
deported. 

Q: Right. And why did you start early and not ot
her people, do you think?  What -- what was the 
difference be tween the -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
75 
 
 
A: I think, number one, if you had not still money, for instance, for the van.  
Q: For -- for the what? 

A: For the van. The van, it™s cal
led, where we had everything. 
Q: The van? Uh-huh. 

A: The van. 

Q: Oh [indecipherable] 

A: It is a big, big -- 

Q: Oh, oh, like a van or like a truck. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: But I tried to -- so ma ny had not the luck to get an affidavit for instance, you know?  To 

America. Because, I mean, we knew some one who was living in New York, a Viennese  survivor  

of -- a psychoanalyst. We knew here, and she was w
onderful, she ta -- sent us right away a wire. 
So anyone who got an affidavit could leave to 
America. But ma ny people didn™t know anyone -- 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: -- in America, for inst ance -- 

Q: Yeah. 

A: -- and go to America.  

Q: We re a lot of people going to 
Palestine at that time as well? 
A: I don™t think many. 

Q: No?  Not fro m Vienna?   

A: I don™t think ma ny [indecipherable] 

Q: You didn™t know, did you? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
76 
 
 
A: Yeah, from my fa mily, from 
my father™s family some went. 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: From Father™s family some went there, and -- 
to Israel, to Pa lestine at that time , but I don™t 
know whether ma ny people went and frankly I don™t know if -- 

Q: Did you have friends that 
-- that went, yourself, or -- 

A: No, and through [indecipherable] went there 
who only -- I only know of them, and they were 
a cousin and her children. 

Q: Did you and your husband ever
 think about going yourselves? 
A: To -- to Israel? But ne ver, we neve r -- 

Q: Why?  

A: Because he was not really -- he wa s Jewish fe
eling, but this was nothing attractive for us to go 
to Palestine -- and to -- 

Q: Why is that? 
A: -- wa -- we never -- funny, 
we never thought of it.  
Q: You never thought of the -- the Zi
onist dream of going back to -- 
A: No, no, no, no, no -- 
Q: Eretz Yisr ael or  anythi ng like that? 

A: -- we never -- we were not Zionists, definite
ly not. And we thought -- 
I me an, and e veryone of 
course thought of -- toward my husband, he will ne
ver have any difficulty to find a job, a ma n of 
this caliber, of course he will right away
 have a job, people thought. And we thought too. 
Q: Course, even in Israel today, there are ma
ny very, you know, people with Ph.D.s that are 
lucky to get a factory job -- 

A: Of course -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
77 
 
 
Q: -- even, I know. 
A: -- nowadays it is different -- 

Q: Yeah. 

A: -- everything different. At that
 time Palestine -- at -- it wasn™t
 so at tractive. I mean, it isn™ t 
attractive for me  today because it is much too much
 going on there. It is -- it is a horror to see 
this shooting forth and back. And I ha
te also when the Israelis shoot. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: I hate it, because it is a oc
 -- no, we never thought of Israel. 
Q: And -- 

A: Of course, I only thought of Paris, because 
I loved Paris and I knew the people who want to -- 
want to have me  there teaching again, you know? That
 -- that is attractive, 
of course. But luckily 
we came to America, wi -- very lucky. 

Q: And -- and like you say, you came 
early enough. I guess I -- I just
 want to ask you whether -- 
you know, I™ve talked to other people who™ve 
s -- y-you know, in -- in -- in doing other 
interviews with other pe
ople who™ve survived -- 
A: Oh [indecipherable] 

Q: -- there was one other woma n whos
e name  I -- I™ll have to look up -- 

A: Where is she living, in Boston? 

Q: Yeah. I imagine you mi ght know her, let™s see. 

A: I -- I th- -- 

Q: René Schorr?  René Sc horr? 

A: Schorr?  

Q: Schorr. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
78 
 
 
A: No.  
Q: No.  

A: But Schorr is th -- is -- is -- sounds fa miliar. 

Q: I™m pretty sure she wa s from Vienna, yeah. 

A: Schorr sounds fa miliar. 

Q: René Schorr, yeah.  

A: But I don™t know where to put her. 

Q: Yeah. She lives near here, some where. But -- but
 I don™t want to attribut
e this necessarily just 
to her, but in general talking to Holocaust survivor s, people who survived this --  this era, this 

horribl e era, there™s a f -- I felt a si --
 a sense almost of why -- why me ?  How --  
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- how did I surv
ive and so ma ny -- 
A: It is the biggest one that ther
e is, that our family was so lucky. 
It is really terrific, where we 
were so ma ny, but I only thi
nk because we left early. 
Q: Right. 

A: And everyone a -- only mothe -- parents lost th
eir belongings, but the si -- my both sisters had 
also all the belongings here, as I had. So it is 
really like a wonder that we didn™t have to go 
through that. I mean, it was an awful time  when 
my brother-in-law was in prison, because we 
didn™t know, do they keep him for good.  

Q: Yeah. Did you e -- did you or anybody in your fa
mily, do you think, ever f
eel guilty of the ti -
- you know, I mean -- not --  

A: That -- that --  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
79 
 
 
Q: -- not that it would be rationa
l, but -- not that it was a rati
onal thought, but that people -- I 
know pum - -  some  people felt oh, you know, it™s not
 fair that I surviv
ed and so ma ny other 
people didn™t. Did you ever go through that experience? 
A: No, I never -- I never -- I 
never heard of it of anyone. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: It mi ght be, you know, you don™t talk about everything. 

Q: Right. 

A: And I have to admit, I was only thankful. I 
didn™t feel guilty, only th
ankful that my husband 
decided America is -- is the right 
thing, and not Paris. I am only 
thankful, because it was -- it was 
really up to him only to decide. A
nd I didn™t feel guilty, I felt only re
ally, as I said -- I -- I feel  it 
so -- such a luck is that we  three sisters were 
in America, and could he
lp each other, you know, 
in ma ny ways. Because my sister
 and brother-in-law went to 
Boston and I™ve take n care of 
sitting her children in -- in New York in the m
eantime. You know, we could help each other with 
little things, which were important. And -- and 
I was lucky they were 
here because I love 
children and so I saw children. I had children he
re. And then the grandchildren came , so I was 
very lucky as long my sister lived. And now they tr
y also to say al -- all nice to me . And I have 
two nephews who are my husband™s side here, w
ho are psychiatrists and psychoanalysts, and 
they are very nice to me , so I™m lucky, really. 

Q: Do you feel that e-even though your experien
ce was not horrific and di
rect in -- in the way 
that ma ny -- ma ny others was, do you feel that th
ere™s some thing that you 
want to say about your 
experience, or any lessons that you would like 
future generations to understand about what 
you™ve been through and -- and the way that
 you™ve thought about 
it in your life? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
80 
 
 
A: Yes. You know that I know that my -- for in
st ance, Lynnie. They will br ing up the children 
with the knowledge of horror, what happened. A
nd therefore Lynnie wanted, I started to write -- 
which I don™t write -- write -- she asked me  to wr
ite about Holocaust. And then she was so happy 
when she heard that you will interview me , because she wanted her children to know what was 
going on when we left Austria. And she want
ed the children know 
about it. And I had a 
wonderful experience with frie
nds here sht -- all my friends
 were pupils, of course. And 
[indecipherable] invited in their house and the hu
sband asked me  about leaving Austria, about 
why, and so on. So I told him I™ m Jewish and so on. And then children came  for dinner and he 

said, I want that Erna repeats now, so that 
you know, what s -- what 
she went through. And I 
admi red that. I was very happy, because these ar
e people [indecipherable] of course not -- not 
Jewish. And I admi re that the father told 
the young children, you shoul
d know what was going 
on, why Erna is here, you know?  But I have really
 to say I always felt, because we are two. I 
never felt I did it for myself. I felt always I just
 ma ke it as easy as possible for my husband. And 
I™m sure he felt the sa me  for me . People who went
 -- came alone, I tried to help a lot, because I 

felt so bad for them. I had a girlfriend, for inst
ance, from Vienna, and we knew her very well, 
and she was here in Boston, and she wa -- and ever
y weekend, whatever we did we tried to -- to 
take her, because she was alone. And that -- that 
is hard, to come  alone. And her mother died in 
Vienna, but not in the concentrati
on camp, she was sick. So it™s -- that
 is -- ma kes it really hard. I 
feel this was a really --  lucky that I had the pa
rtner for whom to -- to 
be. And I never regretted 
that I work hard, or so, I -- I didn™t know it. I di
dn™t know it, the others 
knew it, but I didn™t know 
that I work hard. I™d -- we were -- and I™m ve
ry lucky now, because my husband [indecipherable] 

so little, and I also [indecipherable] to Rube
nstein. We  both earned 30 dollars a week, that I 
reme mber like anything. Then his mother ca
me , and we didn™t know whether we have enough 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
81 
 
 
money for it -- to -- for eating. And -- and my hu
sband always said, because we couldn™t put 
money aside, he said, what will we do v -- when
 we both retire? And I said, we will be in a 
rocking chair and reme mber the good old times. 
But I thought -- I collect
ed ma ny things about 
exercises, I thought I will write in paper, in news
papers about exercises if
 I can™t teach any more. 
And I™m a very bad writer, but I thought I would.
 My husband would have helped me . So is -- it 
is really when I think back to the ™38, it was, of course horrid, horrid to leave your -- where you 
were born and where you lived, and all your friends th
ere, and to leave the 
parents, that was the 
worst. And then, when we left with the airplane, 
I think it was the fi rst time I was in an airplane, 
and the cook came -- or maid ca me to the ai
rport and waved good-bye, you know, it was that -- 
an awful experience, of course. 
But I never thought again and agai
n, of it. Because I really -- we 
both wanted to assimilate here, even if my 
language is not assimilating, but we both wanted 
really to ma ke the best with our life, and not
 ma ke it harder, and we had no money to get -- go 
back to Europe. ™63 i -- i-is the firs
t time I went back, 
after 25 years.  
Q: You went back in si -- 

A: To Europe. 

Q: Did you go to Vienna? 

A: At that time -- I have to tr
y to think. Yes, I went back to 
Vi enna and there was the friend who 
ma rried a non-Jew, and they were in New Zeala
nd and they were back, and he got back his 
factory for the -- he ma de furniture. And the pe
ople kept the f-factory going, and when he came 
back, he and his brothers, they returned it to
 them. Which was wonderful, it showed what good 
bosses they were. And yes, I went then to Vienna, 
and with a car we went to -- with their car we 
went to Salzburg. So --  

Q: What did it feel like to be in Vienna 
after that time, all that horribl e things? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
82 
 
 
A: It was awful. I went to the apar tment -- I 
wanted to go to the apartment where my husband 
and I lived, but I started so much to cry that I 
didn™t want to ring the 
bell whoever was there. I 
couldn™t. But whether I went the first time, or 
another time, I went to
 the apartment of my 
parents, where we lived. And that 
was -- that was very hard. That was, of course very hard to see 
again, everything you left. 
Q: Did the people take you -- let you come  in? 

A: Yeah, the people -- the people were quite nice,
 but I think my sister
 was already here, she 
said, again some body?  I sai
d, but I wasn™t here yet.
 Because I-I think my sister was there, or my 
brother, I don™t know who was there before, you 
know?  But to the apartment with my husband, I 

think I tried in ™63, and I think to my parents I 
went another time. I didn
't  go often to Vienna, 
only to take a course close to Vi
enna. I have taken a dance course
. But I -- but every year I was 
in Europe to Salzburg because 
I love Salzburg, and my tra -- my
 favorite cousin was there. 
Q: So you traveled back to Austria many times? 
A: Every year I went after ™
63 -- I think [indecipherable] 
Q: So you created new memories for -- for -- 
A: Yeah, yeah. [indecipherable] 

Q: -- Austria for you. 

A: But I didn™t -- I don™t like Vienna as much
 as Salzburg. Salzburg is -- do you know Salzburg? 
Q: No. 

A: It is so beautiful, and so love
ly a-as -- it has such an old part
 of -- Vienna, of course, too, but 
it is a lovely place. So I went, and also I had a 
cousin whom I  loved there much and they had at 
the lake, a house there. So that was very nice, 
and I went to Switzerland 
a lot, to the mountains, 
of course.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444

Q: We ll, is there anything else 
that -- that you™d like to say 
that I haven™t asked you about that 
you think it™s -- in -- that 
you™d like to -- to share? 
A: I™d say to -- I™ d like to say that  the American
s ar e -- were awfully nice to me. There was -- I -- 
e -- very slowly I worked up my studio where I ha
d pupils, as an exercise teacher. I didn™t do any 
photography here. And I feel alwa
ys a f -- I started underground, a
nd it wa s hard to get really on 
the ground. And during the war, or af -- right afte
r the war -- ™47 it was in
 fact, one of my pupil 
one day ask me , do you care to use our farmhous e 
in New Hampshire?  I said I will ask my 
husband. My husband at that time had no job, and 
wanted that I go alone on vacation because I 
needed it, and he wanted to stay in Boston, 
which I never would have done, to leave him in 
Boston alone. And of course he
 was delighted. We me t. Before, she didn™t know my  husband, I 
didn't know her husband. All I knew her during th
e time, during the war, she has taken me  -- 
sometimes in the evening she invited me for di
nner. And my husband worked for -- sometime in 
the evening at the -- to make t
eeth [indecipherable] teeth, false 
teeth. So I knew her only from 
that. This farmhouse wa s in New Hampshire, 
surrounded by 2,000 acres woods. It was a dream. 

Then she told me, but it has no electricity. And water it has only when the windmill goes, to get 

the water down. It was so lovely, 
it™s -- the first time, of course, 
we were together. And then we 
were also some  weekends, I thi
nk, together. And they saw that 
my husband repaired everything, 
whether it was on the roof, or whatever was to be  repaired, he was very handy. And I, of course, 

cleaned the house. So we got the key. Until six --
 ™69, we -- my whole family went there. We 

always spent all of the holidays there together, 
the whole family. They came from New York, the 
Streichers with the -- then with the children, 
afterwards with the gr
andchildren. We  had the 

house all the time, very seldom they went because 
they had a yacht, where they were in summer. 
In winter we couldn™t, in the 
-- when it was snow. And when mud was, we had the Jeeps they 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
84 
 
 
had there. So we left our car up, and -- but the 
first year, ™47, when she asked me  whether we 
want to use it, a f -- a farm, we had no car. Th
ey [indecipherable] anothe
r to -- pupil to ask me , 
would you care to use my car?  I go on the cruise. So
 we had a car of another pupil. I thought that 
the [indecipherable] were terrific 
to us, really terrific. To let 
the house have us. All the time we 
were there. They moved then to Maine, so got 
-- first they lived on Br
attle Street. Do you know 
where the -- the church is of the 
-- not Albanian, it™s a -- it™s Spar
ks Street and Br
attle Street, the 
church?  
Q: In Cambr i dge, you mean? 

A: Yeah, in Ca mbridge. 

Q: I -- I™m sure I™ve been past it, I don™t remember.  

A: Yeah, because there the parent s lived, with the biggest  garden in Camb ridge. And they lived 

in the back, there was a 
kind of mus e um of a prof
essor and they lived there. But then they moved 
to Maine and used -- very seldom they went to 
New Hampshire to the farm. So we were all the 
time there. In summer we were there, because 
it didn™t cost us anythi
ng. And my sister Risa, 
Felix and the children and 
the grandchildren, everyone was there, 
til ™69, and then 
they sold that. 
But then also my brother-in-law died and the 
-- we wouldn™t have gone
 any more as much up 
there. But from ™47 to ™69, and it was so wonderful
 for all of us. And we learned how to ma ke 
[indecipherable] and we learned how to cut trees,
 we never did it, but we learned it from them, 
you know, to saw wood. I learned to -- how is it
 called when you swing the -- and split? 
Q: S-Split wood?  With the axe? 

A: Split wood. Not with the axe, I coul
dn™t do the axe and I know now why -- 
Q: With thehatchet? 

A: Pardon?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0444  
85 
 
 
Q: A hatchet? 
A: No, no, with that -- yeah, with a 
hatchet, but you have a word for it. 
Q: A wedge? 

A: A sledge -- sledgehammer. 

Q: Sledge -- yeah, okay. 
 
A: A sledgehammer. 

Q: Sledgehammer. 

A: That I could do, but I couldn™t do a axe, I 
think I was astigmatic and couldn™t point, you 
know, the axe. But we worked in the woods, and it 
was just wonderful for us. We  -- the first year 
when we didn't know what to do in the woods, 
when we were there, we went on all the 

mountains around, because we loved so much. So 
it was really, I have a very good experience. 
And now, walking with a cane, and walking with 
one eye black, people want always to help me . 
They are so kind, and I always hope not 
to be seen by my pupils with a cane. 
Q: We ll, Mrs. Karplus, thank you very much for sharing some  of your stories. 

A: Yeah. D-Do you think you have enough? 

Q: I think this has really been a -- a ve
ry, very good afternoon. Thank you for your time. 
A: No, I -- I -- wa -- it wasn™t --
