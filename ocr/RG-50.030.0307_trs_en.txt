WILLIAM LO EW 
March 9, 1995 
 
Q: Can you tell us your name
 and where you were born?   
 
A: My name  is _______________ and they used to call us Willy or Wilek. Loew was L-O- 
W, but whe n I came to the United States it was changed to L-O-E- W. So the name  

actually here  in the United States is William Loew, but my fr iends back at  home they 

reme mber me as Wilek. I was born in Lwów
, Le mberg. Lemberg is basically a German 
name for Louve and my parents came from proba
bly Austria. I'm not quite sure, but from 
Austria and we settled down in Lwów. That 
was Galicia at the time and also known as a 
Austria Hungarian empire. The time in the ____________ when I was born I had 

basically a nice family, a wonderful family. 
Let me  speak about my brothers. I had an 
older brother we used to call Eli. The oldest
 one was Abe. We had a very close family. 
My mother was very -- was a housewife but al
so dealing in business. Our business was 
we had a brewery a mead brewery which 
is a honey wine. The business was quite 
prosperous. For one thing, our business has b
een derived from prev
ious generations. We 
started, but not my father but my grandfat
her and my uncles they started in 1870. As a 

ma tter of fac t  I still have one
 of the labels of our origin
al wines which is a honey wine. 
Our fa mily was approxima tely 80 persons stro
ng counting my uncles, my grandfathers 

from either side, my mot her's and my  fa
ther's side. We  were more numerous on my 
father's side than on my mother's side. My
 mother's maiden name was Margulies and 
some  of her brothers went to Palestine. At that time  in 1932, 1933 and the rema inder 

stayed there in ____________ at that time. We  
stayed and we tried to continue our 
business. My father died when I was four y
ears old. He died probably 1929 so my mother 
actually took over the business. I don't thi
nk she was a good business woman from what I 
recall. The business continued. We  had my olde
st brother could not get into a university 
in _____________ because there was a quota for the Jewish students, so he  had to mo ve 

out from Louve to Wa rsaw. So, he studied th
ere. This was expensive to study in Wa rs aw 

because the money that we had from the busin
ess was not that prosperous. I'm not quite 
sure the reason for it but I think that my moth
er wasn't  as aggressive in the business as 
she should be. So, if I recall some time in 1934 to 1934 before we folded our business and 

we were no longer in the business of honey wine
. But my uncles they continued to be in 
business. At that time in that pr evious years, 
we used to export our 
wine to different areas 
of Poland that we know and also to other coun
tries. The Jewish life in Louve was the best 
that can be said back in '37 '38 from what 
I can recall was lukewarm. It wasn't  very bad. 
It wasn't  very good. We  did have our quotas goi
ng to school as a ma tter of fact when I 
went for my  exam to enter the gymnasium
 even though the gymnasium was ten blocks 
away from me, I couldn't get in because I 
had a quota. I passed I understand my entry 
exam, but I couldn't get in. That was back in 
1938. So, in order to continue my studies I 

had to move  on some where else and I had to
 go to another gymnasium ba ck on Louve on 
_____________ Street. It was known as the Jewish gymnasium. Going back to '38, '38 

was a fairly peaceful years for our family but
 it was a hardship because we couldn't meet 
the loans that  my father apparently incurred. 
So, things were difficu
lt. My oldest brother 
Abe who wa s in Wa rsaw, he finished his ma st
er's degree and he came back home and he 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0307

tried to st abilize, because he was basically th
e olde st in our family, he tried to stabilize 
the family. Eli who was two years older than 
I wa s, he was more enterprising but for his 
own good. He was not part of -- he would try to 
help stabilize the family but we used to 
love each other and we used to fight each othe
r and we used to do things that 13, 14 year 
old boys used to do. Abe on the other hand was 
much older that we were. He was older 

than I by ten years so he was more a serious
 person and he had very little in common 
with us other than try to ta
ke over the father figure, wh
ich he didn't succeed in ma ny 
ways. In 1938, in 1939 things were getting wors
e in terms of what I recall there were 

quite a few refugees who would be comi ng fr
om the western part of Poland especially 
those Jews who were exiled from Ge rma
ny who came from Poland and some how they 
didn't stay long enough in the western part of
 Poland and they kept on mo ving and settled 
down in our place in Louve. This was in '39 and 
it wasn't  really that bad ye t, yet they 
came the German Jews in thousands and settled down in Poland.  
 

Q: What year were you born?   

 

A: I was born in 1925, October 29, 1925.  

 

Q: Did you work in the winery?   

 

A: No, I did not. We  had people who used to take
 care of that, but as I me ntioned before our 
enterprise, or the winery, wasn't  that mu
ch as busy I think in 1934 or 1935 so I didn't 
work. The only time I went to the cellar or to 
the winery is to see the process of ma king 
wine, how they were stirring the wine and to 
smell the wonderful sme
ll that still persists 
in the winema kers. They were there, of course, I recall we had a winery that took space a 

whole block because that whole block used 
to belong to us. Unde
rneath in the cellar 
under the whole block was the whole winery. 
I recall that barrels 
where the wine was 
stored for aging was stacked four or five ba
rrels stacked high. They were smaller. They 
were not the 55 gallon barrels which is the 
common size here in the United States but I 
recall they were ma ybe 35 gallons. This was th
e standard barrel at that time  to age honey 
wine. I don't recall how long they were aging 
but that smell and th
at wonderful aroma 
contributed from the honey it was still there.
 But in 1934 and 1935 we were all gone and 
I don't know who took over our business. It coul
d have been that my uncles had took it 
over.  
 

Q: You lost your father when
 you were four years old?   
 

A: Right. 

 

Q: Do you remember hi m?   

 

A: Very little. There's only one event that I r
ecall about my father when I was four years old. 
He had a beautiful flag, eight or  nine room
s and each room was designated for a certain 
purpose. Beside the bedroom and the dining ro
om we had what we used to call salon 
which is a large area and we had a special re
ception place for certain events or for our 
friends of the fa mily. So, we had a fairly la
rge flag. My grandfather who actually brought 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0307  
3 
 
me up because I lost  my father when I was four, he used to live with us and my aunt 
Miriam she was a sister of my
 mother and we stayed together. That was my fa mily, the 
immediate family. Our immediate family consis
ted of our three brothers, my mother, my 
aunt Miriam and my gra ndfather. My gr andfather brought me  up. He was in a way a 

philosopher on his own. He was a self taught 
ma thematician. He was a true philosopher. 
Not only would he be reading philosophy books 
but he also was a scholar in his own 
mi nd with the tumult and all the laws of Jewi
sh rights. He would get up in the morning 
four o'clock in the morning and he would be on his way to study in the synagogue. I 

knew that he would wake us up because he 
would be coughing. Whenever he woke up he 
would start coughing because he was a heavy sm
oker and when he left I didn't hear any 
coughing any more. So, he did traditional things
 with him. He would get up and go to our 
synagogue. We used to call it a ____________. He w
ould stay there until from four to 
seven, seven thirty and by that time he w
ould come  home and wake us up and go and 
prepare ourselves to go to school. My grandf
ather, he was very helpful. He actually 

prepared me  for my bar mitzvah. He was very
 fluent in Hebrew and in German and of 
course other languages like Polish and Ukrain ian. But his special language was Hebrew 

and German. By profession he was a pr
inter. He came  from ____________ which is 
south of Louve. He did have one sister I th
ink and he had some fa mily some where in 
Roma nia. I don't know t hat much about grandfather's side because I never me t his sister, 

but I reme mber back in 1938 that 
some body from _______________ which is from 
Roma nia, came to visit us and we knew then 
that there was a cousin from grandfather's 

side that they live in Roma nia. He ha
d a good life what I recalled even though it was 
difficult from a national point of view, but it 
was close. We  were one family. We  ha d a 
good rapport and a good relationship with 
our uncles. The other brewery in ___________ 
that was right across our street so we had a 
major industrial park if
 you will of breweries. 
It was the Isaac Brewery and there was 
the ___________ Brewery and then there was a 
___________ Brewery and we were all together in
 it. It was good. I recall the way we 
were distributing our wine to different stor
es. We had a wagon and horses and we would 
be delivering wine so often. I us
ed to like to go to the barn a
nd every so often just to be 
together with the horses. So, the whole ___________ where we used to live, we used to 

live on _______________ which is a norma l whole bl
ock that compares with any block 
in the United States, it was all one brewery. 
We were sort of like a corner house which 
was a three story corner hous
e that borders on _____________ and _______________. 
That was the ma in road in the Louve th
at carried on for a number of miles. The 
______________ is sort of almost like a district, an 
area where Jews used to live. It was a 
domi nant area for Jewish life. It had ma ny s
ynagogues. In all, the Jewish people used to 
congregate right there. I don't know how many 
thousands of fa milies who are there, but 
there are basically, it was the ma jor
ity in _______________. The mi nority in that area 

were mostly Ukrainians and there was some 
Pole s. There were more Ukrainians in our 
area than there were Poles. This is not 
to say that this was typical for ____________. In 
our area it wa s typical. The ma in activity in ______________ was on Friday where all the 

peasants or all the farme r s would come  
and sell their goods, produce mo stly. We had a 

far mer that would come  and deliver every 
Friday, some ti me s Thursdays, but mostly 
Fridays, dairy and the milk and the butters 
and the produce. The potatoes for winter time . 
The cabbages, all that stuff because _______________ was the ma in outlet for those 

far mers. Of course, we were
 doing also business at the sa
me time. They were also 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0307  
4 
 
purchasing wine. It wasn't  a trade off. It
 was just a ma tter you would be buying for a 
certain period of time. M y mother would be
 purchasing from week to week produce, but 
for the groceries she would go to a special st
ore where it would speci
alize in Jewish food. 
It was a vibrant area for Jews to live. It wa
s very interesting and when the ma rket the 
far mer's  ma r ket was over by Friday night, Fr
iday evening as a ma
tter of fact, you would 
see everything was depleted. The whole area was quiet because Friday night we would be 
going to synagogue, so the area was depleted. Sa
turday it was not as fortuitous but it was 
still kind of vibrant, mos tly
 for the farmers who need to do some  other shopping. So the 
whole weekend was vibrant and active when 
it came  to Sunda y, Sunday was much mu ch 
quieter. Although the Jewish life 
continued. Wh en the life in those days and I'm saying 
'38 and '39 was quite active it was also troubl
esome. Because we wouldn't be completely 
free of any problems. Any rumor that would 
install it would be quite dominant in our 
lives. The rumors were obviously of what 
happened in Germany and what happened in 
some  other countries like in Roma nia or 
Russia although we knew very little of Russia 
but ther e were rumors, and he rumors were that  Hitler was making statements that 

affected us automa tically. There was a m
ove me nt  in Polish society to promote the 
anti-semitism. There was a part of that and anti-semitism was very dominant already in 

Louve and it was moving toward the end that
 we were worried. We  didn't  know whether 

we had to take any action. In fact we didn't 
take any action other than we had a way of 
saying let's wait and see what any troubles would be forthcoming. In 1939 it was a year 

that we will reme mber the rest of our lives 
because it's the year the war broke out. I don't 
reme mber _____________ other than I recall when 
the war broke out it wa s a time  where 
the _______________ was bombarded. All the houses, 
one bomb hit our house. We  were 
then in our baseme nt, actually in the cellar 
was where the winery was, but we no longer 
had the winery but we had the ce
llar. A bomb hit just a part of
 our house, just a part of it, 
but it was -- the damage was done not directly to
 our houses in general, but the staircase, 
for example, which were concrete staircases
, were they were ma rked and there were 
some  splits in it, although we didn't think anythi ng looked collapsed, but there was 

dama ge in it already. When we were in the cellar we had some other friends and some  

people were in the cellar and 
we felt we are in trouble when
 we got out and it was a while 
that I got out with Abe my 
older brother to see the damage. We didn't see any fire. 
Nothing was really down other than one portion was hit and there were some  other 

buildings that were attached to our hous
e and we checked that and I reme mber my 
brother said well, there's not much damage to
 our hiding place. So, th
at I recall that we 
were hit by a bomb. Apparently it wasn't  a la
rge bomb, but from there on, that was the 
beginning of the war and in probably the next 
few days things had happened that Poland 
was divided into two ma jor areas with th
e lights some where west of Louve and the 
Russians came  in. This was a new era that we be gan. The Russians occupied the eastern 

part of ____________ and __________ was part of that
 territory. I recall when the tanks 

were rolling down from ____________ comi ng from ______________ and they were 

huge, huge, I have never seen in my life huge tanks and apparently they didn't have to 

fight anyone because the Polish army was not in
 our imme diate area. If they were they 
were some where else. So, there was no c
onquest to be bragged about. They kept on 
moving, and they occupied _______________ and 
our imme diate lifestyle had not 
changed other than that in the next few w
eeks there was a proclamation of I think it was 
in a few weeks that all the major homes a
nd businesses were confiscated and we had a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0307  
5 
 
new regime  and so on. This was the Soviet territory. So that means that our house no 
longer belonged to us. And probably we did not ha ve to pay any taxes any more because 

this was our main concern pervious, because 
my mother always had to come  out with 
money for the loans we had incurred some  y
ears ago. So, that was a relief in a way. The 
big question was how do you ma ke a living. My mo
ther didn't see how her facial with the 
army showe d that she was concerned about 
those things. Eli was 
basically two years 
older than I was. He wasn't  much concerned 
about the family as much as he wanted to 
find hims elf, and he tried 
different approaches. He  di
dn't feel like going to the 
gymnasium.  He never cared for that. My ol
der brother Abe was concerned because he 
was one of the intellegencias 
and there were rumors that 
the Russians are rounding up the 
intelligencias for reasons that I don't unders
tand. They would put them in prison which 
was on -- I recall that prison being calle
d ______________. Whether they were arrested 
or not I'm not quite sure, but he was with 
us at home . During that
 period of time, 1939 
and into 1940, 1941, there was a period that I don
't  recall too much about Abe as muc h as 
Eli. I continued to study. I continued to go to
 school, the gymnasium until that time. The 
subjects my studies were now ba
sically new. First of all sinc
e Jewish -- this was a Jewish 
gymnasium,  we were told that now we are 
going to be learning Yiddish language. That 
was a surprise. In addition to Yiddish language
 we also had Russian language along with 

the Polish language, along with the Ge rman 
language, which was okay. My mother also 
ma kes sure that she wanted me  to learn the English language and the French language. 

She used to, back in '39, she sent for me  
a special tutor for French and English. I was 
better in English than I was in French. That
's how I picked up some  of my English 
language. But in the Jewi sh gymnasium we 
picked up two mo re languages and I was 
quite proficient in Yiddish, although the Yi
ddish alphabet is the same  as the Hebrew 

alphabet. You actually wr ite in Yiddish 
the way you pronounce it. In the Russian 
language it was very similar to the Ukrainian 
language so I was also pretty much aware 
of that language, so we kept on going with 
our normal, nor ma l studies with exception that 

we picked up two more languages. The life under the Russians don't have too ma ny ba d 

recollections other than that
 during that period of time more since Poland was divided 
into two ar ea s, the German area which is the 
line, quite a few refugees were comi ng more 
so from the western part of Poland to our 
area. Of course the Germans occupied the 
western Poland so they were directly under th
e German authority. And Jews were fleeing 

from that area. I recall that in my cl
ass in ____________ we received at least three 
German students one wa s from ____________, one
 was from Berlin, two were from 
Berlin and one from ______________. And there 
was another fellow who was also a 
student. He was from Cz echoslovakia. 
I don't know he escaped probably from 
Czechoslovakia, but not Czechos
lovakia per se. He was from 
the Bohemi a part that was 
occupied by the Germans. He escaped into Pola
nd and then to the western part of Poland. 
He came to us to the Russian occupied part. In
 all, they were  very jolly fellows. I was 14 
or 15 at that time and of course
 the fellows fr om Berlin they tried to speak either  Polish 
or Russian and they had a horrible accent and th
ey just couldn't  get through because their 
Russian language and the German language th
ey just don't put together. They used to 
pronounce things in German that the pronunciation it was funny for us to listen to them, 

but the were wonderful fellows, very, very good boys.  
 

Q:  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0307  
6 
 
 
A: No, they did not elaborate 
other than would I think woul
d happen was the whole fa mily 
escaped Germany to Pol a nd so there were no problems  with the fa mily and they hardly 

spoke about any events that involved them. 
They were boys. They were my age. They 
were more interest ed in soccer game s. Th
ey were more interested in learning the 

language, how to deal with us because we were actually ____________ and they were the 

Germans so we were basically -- they were not
 even of Jewish nature. We  were Jews. We 
knew the Hebrew. We  knew the laws . They we
re not that much involved. They didn't  
care about that. Not that we cared either because
 we were actually just
 a part of our lives. 
We were not frightened to bring them into our
 way of life. They had 
their way of life. So, 
they did not me ntion anything of their event.
 The refugees who were comi ng in more and 
more from the western part, from Poland, we 
felt that we better slow
ly but surely being 
overwhelmed with those people and the reports th
at they brought from the western part of 
Poland was just bad. They were claimi ng that the concentration camps are being 

established. they were claimi ng that there'
s a terrible persecution going on. We  thought in 
___________ because we  knew about persecution that persecution -- because we didn't 

have the same  rights as the Poles of for th
at matter the Ukraine, but these were true 
persecutions they were telling us. We di
dn't understand what a concentration camp 
means. It was a hearsay and in fact you just di
dn't  believe that. It wasn't  a part that he 
would accept that, it just wasn't  acceptable.
 We  didn't know what people would do in 
concentration camp let alone the establishm
ent and how do you so things people ignored 
that part. But as they were comi ng, more by t
housands, the shed that we used to have at 
home , we have opened up, the salon and the sp
ecial section room. We  ga ve it up for them 
to dwell on it, to live in there. We  had a la
rge kitchen and we offered them everything we 
had. They stayed with us. Some  of them t
ook to work. Some  of them moved out on their 

own, mostly they were not fa milies, they 
were mostly si ngle people me n and wome n who 
came who escaped and tried a ne w life ma ybe it was temporary because they had left 

some  other people back home  wherever thei
r home  was. There was quite a few from 
_____________, from Warsaw from -- I don't recall th
e small towns in the western part 
of Poland. So, they stayed with us for a 
number of months until one day, one night a 
knock at the door, we had a big house in ____________. It was the Russians came in and 

they forced themselves into our place and they
 basically took all of
 these refugees. That 
was traveling ma ybe 1940 there was a time when there was a ma jor gathering, a ma jor 

expulsion of the refugees from ________________ 
to Russia. And we befr iended some  
people there, so we were not far away from the ma in station. I run into that, and they put 

them in boxcars and a cattle trains, cars and 
they were locked up over there. That's  how 
they were going to transport them fr
om _______________ to east to Russia. We couldn't 
do anything about it. I knew they were cr
ying, really crying. What
 did they do wrong?  
These were Russians and this was the main even
t that I recall that the Russians did to the 
Jews. They didn't kill them, but they put them
 away. We  found out later that they were 
sent to ____________ and to different parts of 
Russia. I never me t them a gain. Life in 
________________ continued after that expulsion un
til anothe r war broke out and that 
was in 1941 and that was the time  when the ma in when the Germans invaded

Tape #2 
 
A: So when the Germans oc cupied ____
____________ there was a part that we didn't 
--when I saw we, I'm talking about the fa mily. 
The fa mily, my mother 
or my brothers and 
I was just a boy listening to what's happeni
ng, what surrounds us. We  were concerned yet 
there wasn't  much that we could have done even though that it would be an imme diate 

danger. Our imme diate danger would have been
 from the local people that we would be 
threatened by. As I me nt ioned before we lived in _______________, which the ma jority 

of people were actually Jewish people, but 
also the mi nority were the Ukrainians and 
Poles. We  were not quite sure how to take 
it, what really happened, although we heard a 

lot that the Germans are very
 threatening people. We  soon 
found out that the first few 
weeks in Louve after the German occ upation 
of Louve, there were quite a few robberies 
and personal insults and personal beatings of 
Jews by the Ukrainians. Some  of the m were 
maybe Ukrainians, some of them were maybe 
Pol i sh, but it wa s very dangerous to go out. 
It was very dangerous to walk on the street. 
Soon, we had a curfew that would not allow 
the Jews to walk after certain hours, even
ing. That was ma ybe just as good, but the 
problem that we actually had when it came to
 night, that was the time when the ma in 
robberies and the ma in assaults on Jewish fa
milies began. It was the ni ght first 1:00, then 
2:00, then 3:00 in the morning. They would ru
sh into the house and if they couldn't find 

anything, they would destroy 
or ma im people. Only during 
the night could you hear the 
night cries, the night help re
scue, seeking help. This was hor
rible right during the night. 
We, at home we were basically safe because on th
e first floor we had a tenant that  used to 
live and apparently he wa s a ___________. He wa
s half German and half Polish, I think. 
They occupied that level and they actually co
ntrolled the gate, not th
at he would help us 
directly but people know that 
some body's -- Snyder I think was his name, he lived in that 

house, so we were basically protected. But 
you could hear at night
 the horrible screams 
being robbed and ma i med and so on. It was a very bad period, but it wasn't  getting be tter 

because every week there would be new regulat
ions and new instructions and at one point 
and I don't recall exactly the month, we got 
instructions that we had to vacate the 
premises, the homes, where we used to live,
 and move into a small ghetto that was 
_________________. To find a dwelling and to move out, and we didn't have that much 

time. The furniture, the paintings
, the rugs that we had, some 
of that Snyder took in his 
possession. He felt where we were going we wouldn't need them. All the beautiful 

paintings my father bought in Vienna, and the 
rugs. It's imma teri al now, but at that time it 
meant a lot to us. So, we moved out with a 
basic one couch and some  of the belongings 
that we had from the whole flat
. It wa s my mother, myself, I 'm not sure if Eli was there. 
My oldest brother, Abe, he was no longer w
ith us. He was taken away just before we 
moved out to that small ghetto. He apparently
 went to a hospital to
 get some  medicine. 
He never came  back. He  had to go downtown to where later on it became  the ma jor 

ghetto. It seems to me it was close to 
the _____________ ghetto. He went there and he 
never came back. We  di dn't know what happene
d to him. We heard that later on one 
hospital was emptied by Gestapo or by people who worked with the Gestapo. They took 

them away. I'm not quite sure 
when _______________ was established. ____________ 

wasn't  even at that time  a bad word. But we heard ______________. ______________ is 

an area where Jews were killed and 
it was adjacent to _______________ camp. But we 
heard that word ______________. So, he was not with
 us. Eli was in and out of our area, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0307

our home. Not quite sure what he was doing. I'
m sure he was trying to survive, trying to 
find some  angles to get out of a bad situ
ation. We moved out  to that small ghetto. A 
secretary to our business who used
 to be our secretary, she used to live in that area, in that 
small ghetto in a free standing home and sh
e offered her house to my mot her. I don't 
know the deal that she made with my  mother 
but at least we were 
secure that we had a 
house to go to and that was a relief because at 
that time  it was very difficult to get an area 
because you're talking ma ny thousands of peopl
e had to move out of one area to another 
area where you have a comparable exchange of
 dwellings. It wa ques
tionable, but we had 
it. With our house in that free standing hous
e and I recall there were ma ybe  three rooms  

perhaps and there was another family that move
d in with us. Now, it was a period of time  
that we acclimated ourselves into this new ghetto. The faces that we didn't know before 

all of a sudden we knew them very well. Th
ey were all Jews. The 
way I understand that a 
Jewish police was for med who supposed to 
bring law and order in the ghetto and our 
_______________ ghetto. We  were not much concerne
d with them, other than there was 

another area that we were quite
 ambi valent that we did not 
know what that all me ans to 
us. We  all of a sudden have a new life in
 a new ghetto, new people, new surroundings. 
The future, who knows what it's going to bring. 
The rumors were actually in that ghetto 
that those people who work will be  much bette
r off if they don't work, meaning that you 
better have a place to work and then you'll be ge
tting some  kind of iden
tification card that 
will help you survive. Survival  real ly didn't mean too much to us other than it came to the 

point where you had to survive some how not know
ing of ca mps or anything of that that 
we are immediately placed in 
jeopardy of our lives. That di
dn't  grasp yet. We  weren't 
involved in that. We  wer e  involved mostly
 in our personal belonging, in our personal 
lifestyle and being attacked by hoodlums 
because you are a Jew you are no longer a 
human being. The ghetto didn't mean to us th
at this was the end of our line. It was 
perhaps the end of persecution 
by the Ukrainians. You were not
 directly confronted with 
the physical abuse, the physical ma iming 
of people. The rumors were you better get 

work. That was in '41. I was 16 years old, and 
I wasn't  -- didn't  know where to find work. 
Where do you find work in ghetto and I run ac
ross a friend of mi ne who told me  that 
there is a place on _____________ Street who 
-- and they called it ____________ that 
they'r e looking for some  workers, but he felt that I wouldn't be strong enough. I didn't 

know what the work consisted of, but anyway 
it was some thing to look into. I went back 
to my mother and told her that there is a 
place that I was told that they'r e looking for 
some  workers and whethe r she would allow me
 to go interview. My mother didn't think 
that she objected other than she warned me
 be careful. I went there. I went to 
____________. They called it later on __________________. ______________ is a 

factory or was a factory that made tar paper 
for the roofs and the way they were doing is 
you roll out a three foot
 section of paper and you dunk it into
 asphalt. Later you roll it out 
and there are some  people who were using dr
y sand and covering the wet asphalt and that 

become s a tar paper. What they were looking 
for workers who could carry balls of paper 
75 to 80 kilos of paper to go from one place, sa
y from a truck to the depot that they had 
right in the back, or storage pl
ace, and I wasn't  sure that I 
could do that, but if that meant 
to have an i.d. and be protected
 I better do it. I walked into the offi ce and told them that I 

would like this work if they could have me
. Ther e was ma n c a lled Fessel. He was a Jew 
from Slazia, it was in Poland, and he looked at
 me  and close to him there was a foreman, 
a Polish forema n. I forget his name  and he
 asked me  can you use this young fellow and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0307  
9 
 
he says yes I can only if he can
 carry that ball. He  took me  
out and tested me out, and he 
select ed the largest ball, 75 kilos. Every ba
ll was numbered and 
I picked it up and I 
carried it and I dropped it the pl
ace where he wanted me  to drop it and he hired me  on the 
spot. You can work with us. It was basically not 
a relief for me  other than that I felt that 
I'm e mployable. I went back home told my 
mom that I have a job and ma ybe we'll be 
more secure. From there on it was very little
 things I recall other than I was working 
every day with them goi ng back from ghetto to ______________ or ______________. 

It's ma ybe a 20 mi nute walk, ma ybe 30 mi nutes. 
So, at that time , I was going back and 
forth and my mother all day long I would 
be working and evening I would be comi ng 
home. At the same time I was able to purchase some produce at the pl ace I used to work, 

like toma toes and ma ybe  bread although we 
could buy some  bread but we  were rationed 
in ghetto. So, it was helpful. I don't recall at what point they ha ve established living 

quarters in ________________. It was some  ti me  
later than -- I'm 
trying to recall 
something which I'm not quite at ease with me. Let me say the time someti me in August 

of 19-- it was in '42 already. I did work a num
ber of months. It seems to me going back 
from ghetto to _________________ and here I'm blank a certain period of time that I 

cannot recall. The image that comes to my 
mi nd now is August the action. We called it 
____________, where that small ghetto in _______________ was basically almost 

evacuated. Practically all the Jews we
re taken and I was at that time in 
________________. _____________ was located on 
)
ó
kiewska Street. The main 
entrance was from ____________ which was th
e ma in thorough between north and 
south. And it was the area which would bewithin a couple blocks of where my home  

used to be, a couple blocks from my uncle's
 it used to be and so on. There was a time I 
recall when the action came  about in
 the ____________ ghetto and it was close to 
evening. Some body rus hed into the factory one 
of our workers. They were moving them 
out to the street. We  moved out, I moved out 
immediately to the ga
te to see what we 
wanted to see. We  saw what we didn't want
 to see, thousands and thousands of ghetto 

people were moving and going to _______________ St
reet. I looked and I saw some  of 
my friends. My friends, dear fr
iends that I used to play w
ith. Some acquaintances. I was 
looking for my mother. I didn't see her, didn'
t find her. It was ma ybe twenty rows and 
miles of people. They were slowly ma
rching. They were guarded by Ukrainian 
_______________. I didn't  see any Germans. M a ybe in the back, but I didn't see them. 

Mostly Ukrainian on each side. I didn't  see th
e front either. I came  right in the mi ddle. I 
didn't see the beginning the march, I didn't see 
the end of the ma rch. I just kept on seeing 
the area where it was visible to me from that
 narrow gate. They didn't see me . I saw them 
because the gate was actually locked
, the _____________ gate. It was going on for hours 
and hours because there was a slow ma rch. 
Finally it ended. Peopl
e were looking from 
the windows because all _______________ was inha
bited by Ukrainians and Poles, 
second third stories, they'r e all looking at them
. It was a very gr im sight. I don't recall -- it 
was the following day that I decided to go to the ghetto. Although they warned me  not to 

go, they I mean Fessel and the di
rector of the factory. At that
 point in time I did already 
have my i.d., the identification card. I don't r
ecall whether I ha d to wear a band or not. I 

probably did, but I don't recall that. But I got 
into ghetto because I wanted to see what 
happened to my mother. I rushed into th e house. The house was empty but the hiding 

place where we had the hi ding place for my mother was a couch. A couch consisted of a 

fra me and on top of the fra me there was this 
soft part which is the couch. You couldn't 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0307  
10 
 
tell whether that couch was separate for a
nyone else it was one part. The fr ame and the 
couch, the upper part was one unit. That's 
why when there was any action, my mother 
would be hiding there. I would ma ke sure of
 that. When I got home , the upper part was 
moved so I was scared of that. When I cried out for my mother she came to life. She was 
there. She wa s on the inside of the couch so 
even it was moved, she was in that area. She 
was wrapped around in a blanket, a dark blan
ket. So even though they were looking for 
her, they didn't  find her. She was there, so we had our mo me nt , with my mother. A 

number of weeks went by before another ac
tion came  about. I think during that action I 
lost my mot her, and I don't know how they 
got her. So, she was gone. Eli was gone, Abe 
was gone. It was a part of that they have th
en decided to establish a living quarters, I 
think, on the premises of __________________.  
 

Q: Can I ask you some thing before 
we get to the living quarters?  
 

A: Sure. 

 

Q: What happened to your 
grandfather and Miriam?   
 

A: My grandfather died during the Russian time.
 He died -- I don't  recall but it was during 
the Russian occupation and he was buried in a 
grave yard. We felt that this was a very 
timely death for my grandfather to die, not 
to see everything. But it 
was definitely during 
the Russian occupation that we 
were not harassed at that ti
me . Aunt Miriam she stayed 
with us. Aunt Miriam did not have a good rapport 
with my mother, but at the time  of t hat 

bad time, they changed their mi nds or they ha
ve relaxed their anger or whatever it was, 

they were back together, at le
ast on a talking basis. If I reca
ll, she moved with us to the 
small ghetto. At what point she was taken I 
don't recall. But I don't recall her that muc h 
although I really liked her. Sh
e was one of the intellegenc
ias, but she was a strange 
person to ma ny eyes, but not to me . I was her 
favorite, but what happened to her, I don't 
know. I don't recall. Whether she was taken, 
the action I don't know because from the r e 
on I did not see her. I don'
t recall where she went.  
 

Q: Tell me  something about Eli and your fa m
ily?  Were you angry at him for not sticking 
with your mother at this time?   
 

A: No. Eli was very special to me . He was 17, 18 
at that time  and he had his own friends. He 
had ma ny gi rlfriends. He always looking for 
money. He needed money. I was more of a 
fa mily son. I was closer to my mother and 
assuring that everything was under control and 
Eli was not the opposite of me  and he wasn't  
completely with me  as
 I would like him to 
be. Abe was completely different. He was mu
ch older than we were. He was ten years 
older. He had his own friends. He had very litt
le to do with us. He would want to talk to 
me  other than in Hebrew. He despised Polis
h language, so he would only speak Hebrew 
to me , and I had to respond to him also 
in Hebrew. Although my Hebrew wasn't  that 

good, but I carried on a conversation with him. It
 was some thing that I wanted to impr ess 

my brother Abe at one point in time ther
e was a Serbian or Yugoslavian king or 
Ruma nian king that abdicated some time  in 1938 
and I tried to tell him this in Hebrew. I 
don't know whether he responded to me , but this 
was the time  I recall an event that I tried 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0307  
11 
 
to impress and I wanted his assurance. Abe 
was a little bit on the 
snobbish side because 
he was always with his fr iends
 talking about zionism, talki
ng about the world's affairs. 
He tried to settle all the world's affairs. E
li was completely different from both of us. He 
was more or like a happy go lucky fellow. He
 wanted to live now not tomorrow. Now is 
the day. Since he didn't have that much, he w
ould take certain things from home  and sell 
it to satisfy his needs, and I was fighting with 
him. I wasn't  a ngry with him, but I tried to 
preserve things that the fa mily had. He unders
tood that very well, but
 he was my favorite 
brother because ma ybe we were fighting all th
e time and we loved each other and he used 
to give me some secrets and 
at night he used to take me
 outside the house and we would 
be smoking. So, I kept things in secret
. He was very good natured, though. He cared 
about us. Now, Eli was taken away from us 
some  time. I really don't know when. He was 
taken away from that small ghetto. Now I hear
d that Eli was in concentration camp in 
_________________. We weren't sure that this wa s a death camp, but it was very 

fearsome  place to be in. The fact that 
we heard that ____________ and people are being 
killed there. Even though that I 
heard that Eli is there, I felt 
always that when Eli is in a 
tight spot he always will
 get out. At least I hoped
 so. When ____________ established 
the living quarters, I was one of them. We  
were a crew of 40 Jews only me n. It was a 
place where we felt was a very safe pl ace at 
least for the time being. Even it was safe 
place that we  had within the 40 people there were certain gr oups that were more confi ned 

with each other than ot he rs. Probably psychol
ogists would love to study those groups. I 
was basically with a group of boys my age.
 The 16, 17, and 18 and the question is how do 
we get some  cigarettes. That was the ma in 
thing at that time . The ghetto was gone. There 
was nothing that I can do any more in ghetto. 
I didn't  want to go anymore there. As a 
ma tter of fact it was a Jew free area. The onl
y thing that was domi
nant was actually the 
downtown ghetto on _____________ Street a
nd ______________ Street. That was the 
area. I did not know too much about things th
at surrounded us  because we  were confined 
in a given area and the only thing that we h
eard was the rumors that would come  in. Even 
papers didn't come  in. We didn't have any pa
pers. So, the 40 Jews, even though we were 

together, they had such secrets. I didn't  know
 what the secrets were
. I learned later on 
apparently they built an extra wall. There wa
s a baseme nt where we used to live. On top 
there was the factory and the basement was th
e living quarters and in 
that baseme nt they 
erected a wall which was done some time probably before the action in August. I didn't 

know that. Nobody let me  know that
. So, a lot of things -- in 
a way I was a little angry 
that they didn't  let me  know that because 
I could have brought in my mot her, into the 
hiding place. It was a hiding place. It was 
a whole wall and in that fa lse wall, fa lse 
partition, it was covered with wood, piles of cu
t wood that when at night at 12:00, 1:00 
they would remove the wood and people would walk
 out for fresh air. Even at that time I 
didn't know that. I found that ou
t later. When I was living in time  where ma ybe I was  too 
ambivalent, to naive of knowing what was 
going on. But, they were Jews. Fa milies of 
some of these 40 people and when I learned late
r on that there is a hi
ding place and I just 
hoped that Eli would be alive so I could br
ing him here. My work at that factory 
consisted of working first with the bales, 
carrying the bales and sometimes just dusting 
the asphalt with the dry sand. Bu
t then later on since I liked so much hor ses, we had a 
wagon there with horses that we would trans
port asphalt into the factory. There was one 
fellow who was we used to call the forema
n. He took care of the horses and the wagon 

and he would transport the goods, certain asphalt
 and some of them he would bring also 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0307  
12 
 
some  sand to the factory. His name  was _____________. And he selected me  to be his 
helper to care for the horses and so on. I rea
lly enjoyed that. I'd rather work with horses 
than work in the factory. The forema n of th
e factory liked also bunnies, rabbits. He had a 
cage of rabbits in the st all in 
the barn and he asked me  to ta
ke care of them. So, I had the 
horses now and I had the rabbits and I used to 
take care of them. It was pleasant. I liked 
to work with animals and at the same 
time I was the helper of _____________. I used to 
call him _________. He was a very nice fellow. 
A very straightforward fellow. He was 
Ukrainian. He did not see me  as a Jew.
 I was Wilek to him and he was _____________ to 
me . I didn't  care that he was Ukrainian even 
though that I knew that the Ukrainians killed 
Jews and abused Jews and vice versa. He sa
w me as Wilek, a fellow. So, he was very 
nice to me , he was human. We  liked each othe
r. So, I was his assist ant in doing anything 
that the factory needed, to 
take care of. Caring for the an
ima l s but also transporting 
asphalt. This was going on for a number of m
onths. Now, I had an opportunity to go out 
of the factory with him and see what was 
going on. Now, whe n I drove with him on the 
wagon, I did not have a band, I don't think so because I was part of the 

___________________. So, we used to drive oh ma ybe 
a kilometer or so to get the 
asphalt. We  had a refinery not far from us w
ithin a kilome ter or so. And that refinery 
there was an area where there was a refine
ry, there was also a slaughter house for 
animals. In that refinery, the bi product of 
the refinery is asphalt and they would pour out 
the byproduct into an area, a depleted area a 
narrow area not too deep and what we would 
be doing is we would be cutting them in bloc
ks because they were solid and carry them 
on top of the wagon and bring th
em back to the factory.  
 

End of Tape #2

Tape #3 
 
A: So we used to bring the asphalt back to the 
factory and of course in the process of asphalt 
being liquified later on in huge ovens and that's
 how we get the process of that tar onto 
the paper. That was my work in _______________, working with ___________ day in 

and day out. We  were able to drive from our
 factory to ma ybe two or three different 
streets, and of course at th
at time Louve, that area any wa
y, was already Jew free. There 
were no Jews there anymore. Perhaps some  we
re hidden, but there were no visible Jews. 
The place wa s basically very quiet. It wasn't  vibr
ant as it used to be 
the times that I recall 
back in '38 and '39. We were doing this a numbe
r of months and Peter and I we were very 
much befriended. We  were talk
ing about at times that it co
uld happen that one of these 
days they will take me  away. The discussi
on was how do I survive. How do I get out of 
this place. I did not have good 
moves ahead of me. I did not see too ma ny visions, what is 
a good way of doing it. In back of our fact
ory there were tracks
 and those tracks you 
could see every so often Hunga
rian troops going some where and the thought that came  to 

my mi nd, wouldn't it be nice if I knew some  Hu
ngarian language and just jumped in the 
cart and said hey, I'm one of you. But it was just
 a dream. Ba ck with 
Peter, I told Peter 
what's  a good way of surviving. He didn't give me a good answer. One day he came and 

told me , you know Wilek, if I could hide you I would do that, but I can't trust my wi fe. I 

thanked him for the offer or his thoughts. 
We  had a farmer that would deliver some  
produce over a number of years and he was a very good friend of ours. He looked me  up 

in ________________, and he told me  that if you need a place come  to us. So, in that 

preparation I was very gl ad that he offered 
me a place to hide because I was at hi s house 
back on the far m a numb er of years ago, 
a numbe r of times on my vacation. He would 
take me  in to ____________. He had great piergo
s, it's dumplings with good stuffing. His 
wife used to ma ke. I used to ride on the horse
s with him and take care of his cows. It was 
just fun for me  to do that at that time. 
So, he came back, and he looked me up and he 
offered me , I had hope. There's a place to go. 
I had a duffle bag, a leather duffle bag and I 
put in some  of my clothing, some  of my things
 for him to have it just in case I do get to 
escape and ge t to hi s place. So, at least I 
have a place to go. Meanwhile I was working 
with Peter. Because I wa sn't  sure where hi
s farm was, I knew but I really didn't know 

where his farm was, and one day, Peter looks 
at me  and says  Wilek come  over here. Do 
you see this lady?  There was a 
lady that was limp ing that wa
s going to the office. I said 
yes I see her. I reme mbe r  her. I reme mber he
r well. He told me that he delivered a wagon 
of potatoes there. That wa s some  time early
 part of 1943 that he
 delivered a wagon of 
potatoes. It was a custom to buy potatoes in
 huge quantities for winter time and so on. 
That was the way we did that in Louve. I as
ked him what ma kes him think that she's the 
one. I mean how do I know. I don't know but remember her and I'll give you an address 

that in case some thing happens here, you go there. Because he  felt at that time that the 

director Fessel is gr ooming her or groomi ng 
this place for him to hide. I took this as a 
good omen and I felt maybe he's got something 
there. It was a certa
in time within that 
period of time . It was just before the Wa rsaw
 ghetto that it was in 
A p r i l s o me t i me  t h a t  I  
reme mber that two partisans -- a partisan is 
a person who's a guerrilla warrior. They used 
to belong to a Polish underground, and they 
spoke to our leadership in __________ to 
join their partisan group. I'm 
not quite sure what transpired
 but I think our leadership 
rejected them. They didn't trust them. It wa
s during that period of 
time that things are 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0307  
14 
 
getting closer and closer of
 annihilation of the Jewish 
population in Louve. We  knew 
about Wa rsaw and we knew they were fighti
ng. We also knew that the downtown ghetto 
is getting tighter and tighter
. Very few Jews you could see 
being escorted on the street, 
less and less because until that time you see 
a group escorted by the militia. People from 
ghetto to work from work back to ghetto. Of course we were stationary. The group of the 

40 Jews. We  were stationary. We  live right th
en and but we see them once in a while and 
some ti me s I saw on my wagon these groups going 
back and forth. I me ntioned before this 
slaughter house and there was one Jew who used
 to work there and as we were cutting 
the asphalt and that Je w across the field woul
d look and wave to me  and I would go there 
talk to him and ask him what his business wa
s while he goes back and forth from the 
slaughter house back to ghetto. 
But at the same time, he offe red me some  meat to take it 
with me  so I would bring that meat
 back home. Home meaning my ____________ 
people. I would bring that. Occasiona
lly I would be going from ______________ to 
ghetto just to go there. I didn'
t have anyone there. Maybe I would be going with a friend 
of mi ne because he want ed to accompany, but
 I recall everyt ime I would be going there, I 
wouldn't be going there too often, but I was gi
ven an armband with a W letter which was 
for _____________ meaning that we were working for the ___________, the army, even 

though that ma nager of our factory was a capta
in in air force which doesn't  ma ke sense 
but that's the way it was. He apparently 
was very good, very good. A reasonable human 
being. He had an excellent rappor
t with Fessel. He was I think 
captain in the air force. He 
was the one who would warn us when ma jor 
problems  occurred. At one point, he would 
warn us that we were about to be picked
 up by the guards. We would mo ve out. The way 
I dressed my self -- I was dressed myself as 
a typi cal farmer. This is the way I could 
disguise myself the best, with long boots, w
ith special boot type slacks. They'r e specially 
curved that the boot accepts the slacks and with
 a hat and a cigarette in my mouth. I used 
to roll my own cigarettes so 
I was a typical farmer. The firs
t time that we were going to 
be picked up I just left. I had no where 
to go. Ghetto was opened. You could go in to 
ghetto but who wants to go into ghett
o. So I went downtown on ______________ Street 
where I used to go with friends of mi ne a
nd prominent the area when we used to be 
young boys and free of troubles. It wa s like th
ree or four o'clock or two o'clock, 
some thing right afternoon that I ran o
ff from ________________ and there was very little 
you could do downtown other than be pi
cked up by Ukrainians or some body who 
recognized me . I was not, but my safe thing 
was to do was go to a movie house, so I we nt 
to a movie house just to kill time. After that
 time thinking just a few mi nutes ahead, what 
am I going to do next?  I didn't have the answer
. I had to do things that were natural in 
that point in time. I saw a movie, another m
ovie, it was newsreel of cutting. This was 
where the Ge rmans showed how the 20,000, or 40,000 Polish officers were killed. The 

Russians claimed that the Germans killed them. The Germans claim that the Russians 

killed them. This was the time that Saw that 
excerpt. I was all engr
ossed in that because 
for the first time  I hear there was a cutting, 
there was a slaughter of Polish officers but 
from the German side. After the mo vie, I went out and I don't know what time it was but 

I saw a column of Jews were going to ghetto. 
I put my ar mba nd and I joined them. That 
is the only pl ace that I can go right now short 
of being right down town without Jews. So, 
I joined them and I went over there to ghett
o. There was probably a few weeks after the 
Warsaw ghetto or around that time. I knew that
 I had to do some thing very drastic soon, 
but didn't have the opportunity yet. I went 
back to ghetto. The ghetto was so crowded I

did not feel so crowded in my life because that wa s the first time I was exposed to that. In 
other words, living in ________________ in my own bunk in the baseme nt with only 40 

Jews was a paradise from what I have seen 
over here. People were living in the street. 
Just a terrible situation. No clothing, torn cl
othing, and a lady that I recognized who used 
to live on the same  street, she was a daughter
 of a grocer. A very pretty young lady, she 
was probably in her 30s, I think. She became a prostitute in ghetto. But she took me in 

imme diately. She was my neighbor, and she gave
 me some s l otties and I left went to 
another place to another friends, the same  
surroundings, and I walked into an area where 
some  older young me n were looking for how 
do you get out of ghetto. How do you join 
the partisans. And I was right 
in the mi dst of it. On suggestion was we get a whole group 
with the ar mbands and let some of us be the militia, the Ukrainian militia and escort  that 

group all the way down ____________ all the way down because nobody is going to ask 

where are you going with this Jewish group. 
That was one of the questions. The other 
question is where do you the uniforms. Where 
do you get the arms, and so forth. It was a 

round robin exercise, how to you survive yourse
lf. The following day I got word that we 
are safe. In other words I could go back
 to _____________ and resume  my work. I went 
back. I went back to _____________ and resume d 
the work, but now I felt very strong. 
It's only time before things happen. There 
was another major action sometime later, I 
forget when in '43, whether it was June or July, a ma jor action and I was told that Eli was 

there. He returned that he knew about me  
and during the action this was on that day 
some one else was going to go to ghetto also
 because of action,
 rescuing some one. I 
joined them. I said I want to go with you. I we
nt and I took an extra armb and for Eli just 
in case I catch him. I we nt over there and they
 told me the address 
and I went to that 
place and there was a lady there, an empty hous
e basically and asked her about Eli. She 
said he was here, but they picked him up. 
I came too late. I was downhearted. There was 
a place that very few people should be going 
through this exercise. As I was walking on 
the street, there was one fence there and I hear 
right on the other side of the fence, people 
were praying with a loud voice. During the ac
tion and I kept on walk
ing because I had to 
get out of that area. They will pick me 
up but I was secure because I did have the 
armband and I had the W and I had the identific
ation stamp. I forget the stamp. It was a 
swastika stamp and I think it was a red stamp 
which was the most recent  stamp. So I was 
safe. I went through and I got the othe
r people who went with me  from _____________ 
and we ma de our exit in a hurry. At that 
time , I didn't see any buses anymore or any 
trucks anymore. They finished the action for 
the mo me nt so we took our exit out. I we nt 
back to ______________. Eli was gone. They took 
him awa y. So there was nothing I can 
do at this point. He's  gone. The whole fa mily
 is gone as a ma tter of fact. Now, a few 
months went by now and they were talki
ng now about the liquidation of ghetto. I don't 
recall when they had liquidated the ghetto ot her 
than one point in time  just prior that we 
were to be picked up they pronounced that L
ouve is Judenfrau, Jew free. No Jews live 
anymore in Louve. Now, the more I'm thinking from there on, I'm thinking more and 

more about this lady, the limping lady. Peter gave
 me  that address and he told me  exactly 
how to go there to get to that pl ace. There was someti me in the morning, I forget when. It 

was a beautiful morning as a ma tter of fact. 
The sun was out, nice and chilly. Whether it 
was September or October, I don't know. It was some time in the fall one day we were 

told that 1:00 we would be picked up. Now,
 ti me  was early in the morning, ma ybe eight, 

nine, ten. I don't know. I knew imme diately 
that some thing is going on because Fessel 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0307

and Horowitz they were all dressed up. They
'r e ready to move  out. They were not moving 
yet, but they were ready to move out. I didn't 
even try to look down in the baseme nt what 
is going on regardless even though you have a hidi
ng place, I wasn't  about to stay there. I 
decided to go, to move because I didn't  see 
any future in hiding in that place. Sooner or 
later, probably sooner than later we were goi
ng to be discovered, so I didn't  take this 
place as a safe one. My point was is to get out
. The question when, that is within an hour 
or so. I went to Peter. I said goodbye to him 
and I moved out. That was the last time I saw 
Peter. He wished me  luck and I went out. I kept on walking. I don't re me mber all the 
streets that I went through, 
I just followed certain streets and I went through a place a 
ma in thorough and right on the street a fr
iend of mi ne, well, not a friend but an 
acquaintance. A fellow I went to school wit
h, to public school, Sayer his name  was and 

he saw me . He looks at me . Of
 cour se he knew that I'm Jewish and I look at him my 
question is is he going to betray me . I didn't think so. He grabbed me  and we went to a 

gate, to a house and I told him I need your 
help. What do you need?  I said I need you to 
be here at a certain time , a
bout three o'clock. I don't know what
 time  it was then but there 
was plenty of time. I thought I'd need him to go to the station to get my ticket because I 

had my far mer in mi nd. But I was on my way to
 that lady. Just in case I didn't get any 
results there, I'd have a chance to go there 
and I needed him to help me out to buy a 
ticket, a train ticket. I wa sn't  sure how to 
buy it. I wasn't  sure that part how to buy the 
ticket, but besides I needed his 
help anyway if he could offer 
me  or at least not to betray 
me . He said I'll be here at 3:00. What else
 do you need. I told him I didn't need anything 
other than to help me  to go through that pe
riod of that hour or tw
o. I kept on walking. I 
didn't think that I would be betrayed by Sa
wyer. I didn't think so even though he was 
Ukrainian. So, I kept on walking and I went to
 that place. At firs
t I didn't recognize the 
house because he described me  a certain house but when I looked at those houses, they 

all looked the same. Across the field there wa
s barracks where the Ukrainian militia used 
to live. There was an area where I felt well, you do or you don't. I went to one house and 

I asked -- her name  was Maria, and I knocke
d at the door, is Maria home?  The person 
says no Maria here. I'm sorry. Then I went to
 another door. It must have been one of 
those houses so I went to another house. Th
e next time and she opens the door. Maria 
was there. Now, Maria doesn't know me . I know Maria. She was limping. She was a good 

looking lady, probably 25 to 28, Polish. I asked her that I'd liked to see Mr. Fessel. She 

says no Fessel in this house. I said well, pr
obably not but please tell him that one of his 
workers is here. She says no Fessel is not 
here. I said okay. I took off. Maybe I was 
mi sled. I took this as a true sign I was mi sled 
my next option is to go to my far mer. I kept 
on tracing my steps back, the same  way and I was going to see Sawyer. As I walked 

down I'd say a good half a mile down the road, 
I hear some  hollering behind me . It was 
Maria with her limping legs was after me . 
She was hollering for me  to stop. I finally 

stopped and went back, kept on walking towa
rds her and she looked at me . You're so 
stupid and some  other expletives. Co me  b
ack with me . And probably I wa s stupid and 
she took me  back and walked me  right into 
this room in this h
ouse where Fessel was. 
Now, my first impression was grim faces beca
use they were not sure how I got that name , 
how I got the address because
 if I could find them some one else could find them. 
Obviously true, Peter could find them. This
 was their ma in concern. They weren't 
concerned about me  but about Peter. Peter 
as far as I have never seen him drunk. And 
Peter he was such a friend that he would 
never betray me . So there was no concern. I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0307  
17 
 
wasn't  concerned, they we re. The group consis
ted of Fessel and hisbrother. His brother 
was a tall, very heavy set fellow who impersonated a German captain. He had a Germa n 

overcoat and a German hat, but when I saw him,
 he was just Fessel, an obese fellow. It 
was Fessel, his brother, hi
s lady friend, two other people who I don't know how they got 
in there probably through a different route, 
but the route that I know
 how Fessel got into 
this house wa s Fessel his brother, and another 
worker, I think Kline, who used to be his 
personal secretary in ___________. So at least 
two people from our factory, his brother 
which I never saw him before, his lady friend. Th
at lady friend was a sister of that other 
couple, that was already ther
e apparently and another fellow that I don't know how he  
came about there. Maybe he was completely i
ndependent but he was a lover of Maria. So 
we had like seven people there.
 I think there was seven, I was the eighth one. It was a 
time where they were concerned about their se
curity because of Peter. The question was 
whether or not they should send me  back, back to Peter's place home  and tell him no one 

was there. So, I could go and apparently go 
back home  to their pl
ace to secure their 
hiding place. It was stupid and it was very in
considerate and but because  they would put 
me  in a double jeopardy really, because it wa
s very diffi cult to travel, walk that  number 
of miles to his place. They finally decided not 
to do that because they felt that Peter was 
more of a friend of mi ne than of theirs. They 
left it at that. So, now
 I was not one of them, 
but at least I was in a safe place for the time 
being. The area we were in one room I think 
maybe it was another room, but basically I was 
in the fr ont in the large room that was 
together with this hiding fa m
ily. We  had a trap d
oor to the baseme nt which was not in the 
walking place but in a crawling space. We  had 
a special area that was cove red with a rock 

in case some thing happens we all go inside 
and hide ourself there. We  had our food. 
Apparently Fessel had enough money to supply 
for our existence there and apparently 
paying also Maria. I'm s ure
 nothing went free because 
she dema nded some money. I 
didn't have any money so she couldn't get anyt
hing out of me , and she never asked either. 
So, I thought things were taken care of by Fe
ssel. The other couple they also were from 
Louve, I forget their name  and that really i
rritates me  that I don't re me mber those name s 
because they'r e very important  people becau
se even though you're hiding and you're sort 
of in a group relationship, you were strange
rs. Maybe you had one thing in common, we 
are all Jews and we want to survive. Th
ere was one thing in 
common but different 
interests in different projectio
ns in their lives, that was a
nother thing. So, the dynami cs of 
our group was strange, but I could listen to thei
r conversations. I could 
take part of some  
of them, but Fessel was the dominant fellow w
ho would set the tone of this group. There 
was a point in time the ghetto was liquidated al
ready and now there were rumors that the 

concentration camp ____________ is being liquida
ted. The rumors were also that the 
Russian army is moving toward Poland, closer
 and closer. They we
ren't talking about 
imme diate occupation or imme diate conquer of
 the territory but it was close enough that 
you need to ma ke a decision. Whether to stay 
in the hiding place or 
to mo ve on. I did not 
take any part of the decision because my acti
on was always to stay in the hiding place. So 
that wasn't  an option that would be denied 
to me . The other option was whether or not to 
escape Louve all together. There was a 
young couple who would be coming and in 
keeping in touch with us. They had Gentile pa
pers and they had excellent  Gentile fe at ures 

and they would be the ones with whom we
 had contact with the outside. They would 

know how to prepare the papers, Gentile pape
rs and how we could be rescued. Now the 
question was should they take me  into the 
rescue effort moving out of Louve. They 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0307  
18 
 
weren't even talking about Hungary at that ti
me  at all. The question was they'r e going to 
be moving out, should they take me  with them
. I confronted that part with Fessel and I 
told Fessel that although it wasn't  his obligati
on towards me  a t  all but I asked them that I 
would like to be with them. I could always st
ay here, but I want to
 get out of Louve in 
general. This is a horrible place. I don't want to be here, even in hiding. He  said well, 
we'll have to see what our resources are. We
'll have to see if we can give you some  
papers. He apparently was good enough to do that 
for me . I was told that
 their plan is to 
escape ultimately to Hungary from
 Louve to _________ from ____________ to 
_____________ Mountains, through Slovakia to Hungar
y. That's  the plan. I walked with 
them all the way. I'll go with you anyplace you go. I 
felt that I could be of help to them if 
they needed me. The ti me came sometime in 
the early part of December I think, maybe it 
was in December, that we  got our papers, th
e Gentile papers with
 our photographs and 
the stamps a nd the my name  was ____________________. I took the name  of an 

acquaintance of mi ne from _____________. He wa
s a very nice fellow and I thought he 
ought to have my na me . So, from there on, my na me  was _______________ from then 

on until my liberation. My religion was catholic
, and everything else  was true on those 
papers. My birth and where I was born, a
nd everything else except my name  and my 
religion. From there on, there wa
s at night prior to that by 
the way that was some thing 
very interesting happened that I recall. 
You know when you are in hiding for so ma ny 
months you don't know how to purchase things. 
How to deal with the outside although 
we are informed by Mar i e where things are, 
how to get to the station, because now we 
have to move from Louve, buy a ticket, and th
ese are small items but very crucial items. 
Get out of the house, buy a ticket, go into
 the ma in station, buy a ticket and go to 
______________. Finding the place, and find a place and ma ybe a reservation for the 

train or not. That we did not 
know. Maria was not about to buy 
any tickets for us, so they 
asked me  whether I could go on an exercise 
to the ma in station, 
look around, see where 
the purchase ticket box is, see if there is an
ything unusual and go buy the tickets. We ll, I 
went there. One night they left me  and I 
had to go from the place at night walking 
through the fields, throu
gh the barracks of the militia and 
there is a small station. I got to 
the station and I got to the ma in
 station and to see where I co
uld buy tickets. I went to the 
ma in station, bought a ticket. On the way back
 to our place and to see the tempera ment 
and the environment we would be going thr
ough. When I came back, 
all the inhabitants 
of our hiding place were outsi
de just in case to run in 
case they caught me  and brought 
militia with me. They were relieved. I came b
ack. Gave them the report and they were 
ready to move on.

Tape #4 
 
Q: Do you have any idea why Maria would want to
 save Jews or at least save this group?   
 

A: I'm not quite sure. I never asked her. The 
only thing that I could 
stipul at e was that she 
was prearranged prior to that. The fact that
 I saw her one day in a factory walking 
towards the office that means she was prearra
nged. She was given I'm almost sure that 
she was paid, handsomely paid, by Mr. Fessel. I 
know other things that during my stay in 
the hiding would be that her father would be
 visiting her one day in the week and that 
was the day that they used to play similar 
cards to poker and he would be playing with 
Fessel and Kline and Joseph even
ings and it was ma ke sure th
at her father would always 
be the winner on that evening. He ma y be losing 
a little bit, but in th
e end when the game  
was over, he would be comi ng out with m
oney. He knew about us obviously, so he was 
paid that way through winning in this game . Ot
her than that, I don't have any other facts, 

but Maria a person of no wealth. She had this 
house and she was with Usak who told me  
where she used to live and ma ybe that was pa
rt of the attraction, but I'm not sure what 
was the other relationship, whether she did it
 actually strictly for money and part of 
huma n compassion. Maybe it was a combination of both.  
 

Q: Was this a very lonely time for you?   

 

A: It wasn't  lone ly because I was always active. I wa s very active. My mi nd was always 
going regardless what was going -- what surround
ed me . My question was to myself how 
do you get out of this place. I was fierce a
bout it. I was driven 
by that. How do you get 
out and stay alive. Because I felt that I had 
to say some thing later on. Maybe this is why 
I'm here, but I felt that maybe other Jews will 
survive but I think I had a feeling that I had 
to say it, to say that part. So lonely, no I 
wasn't  lonely. I was too dynami c to be lonely. 
So, when they saw me  c o mi ng back from that
 train station and they greeted me  with 

enthusiasm at least at that point in time I 
was one of them and soon after we packed our 
things whatever I had. I don't think I had anythi
ng with me . I just had just my hat, my 
jacket, a scarf, my boots and I was ready to 
go. We went through the ma in station, got our 
ticket. There was a direct train to ___________. 
It was all night. We  went through over 
night and the following day we were al
ready in ______________. We  we
re picked up by 
the smugglers. Now, let me  back off just a 
bit. That couple who us
ed to come who had 
their connection from outside, brought the pape
rs for all of us. That
 couple that I forget 
their name , were left behind because  that's wh
at they chose, to stay. All of us left, 
including the lady friend of Fessel's brother.
 By the way, she was pregnant. She was big 
and my estimation was that she was in th
e eighth month of pregnancy, but she was 

walking and she was also determined to surv
ive. We  were on a train and got picked up 
later on in _____________ by the smugglers whowere previously arranged by this 

couple who gave us all the false pape rs. We  went
 to a pl ace. I forgot this area at the time 
where it was that they took us. I remember th
at we had our lunch with Polish kielbasa. 
We had a piece of bread and that evening or 
that night, we were 
going to move out of 
_____________. Because everyt hing else was prear
ranged. It was some time Dece mb er or 
it was early part of January. 
I don't know that period of time. It was 1944, January or 
1944 or December 1943 but very close to that time.
 I want to say that I am close right on 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0307  
20 
 
the verge between December a
nd January. It was very cold and we took a train from 
_______________ to a small village close to Tatr
a Mountains. It was basically a ski 
resort and we departed from there. We picked
 up and we kept on walk
ing. It was an area 
probably that was not very much gua rded by 
the Polish police. By the way, this ar ea was 
strictly guarded and governed by the Polish pe
ople, Polish police forc
e and border police. 
The smuggl ers were actually Polish. I forget th
eir name . I forget even their faces but we 
got through and we kept on wa
lking through the Tatra mountains. The episode that I 
recall was wa lking in the snow. It was so cal
led and also the snow was very deep. The 
surface of the snow was frozen so each time 
you walk into the snow, you like walked into 
a trap because you couldn't  get out. It was a very difficult walk. Now, the lady who was 
pregnant she had a horrible ti
me  walking. At least I had boot
s but I don't reca
ll if she had 
boots. So, she kept on walking and her friend, Fe
ssel I have never seen him helping her. 
No one else would try to help her Kline or 
Joseph. The older fe llow Fessel, he had a heart 
problem. He  was always holding 
his hand on his heart, so he
 was incapacitated in that 
mode. I was young. I felt good. I was strong and I trie
d to help her. I did help her. I kept 
on walking with her. At first I was wa lking 
with her and giving my shoulder to her and 
embracing her and kept on walking but
 at least we were in st ep 
with the rest of us. At one 
point in time I asked Fessel to help her becau
se I was getting tired and I asked Usak to 
help her or Kline to help her and they all fe
lt that they were too tired themselves, they 
wouldn't survive the trip. I couldn't leave her. 
I had to walk with he
r and I walked her and 
a long time  I just carried her and I didn't  see 
any one of the people to help her out. Such a 
shame, but we survived. We  went through the 
Tatra mountains and got
 into Slovakia. At 
least we were there. We  were
 so called safe and the boarder police grabbed us. They took 
us into a pl ace which I don't recall too much of it, but then later on we identified 

ourselves as refugees from Poland, so we were
 all Polish. So, from th
is police area I think 
they took us into a school. We  were given l
unch and had milk and we were cared for. I 
don't recall how long we stayed there. 
There was another couple from Pol a nd, 
independently they came  in. They were re
fugees. One was a professor I think, a Polish 
professor with his wife, and some  other people. 
At that point they took a picture of us that 
I had it but I lost it during my other events
 but Usak got it and showed me  some  ti me  
later. The object has to move from Slovaki
a now to Hungary and within a few days I 
think we were moved fr om Slovakia to anot
her border town which I have a hard time 
reme mbering. It was _____________ come s to my mi nd. Maybe I'm wr ong but 

________________ was the border. There were some  Jews
 - -  see Hungary at that point in 
time was not occupied. It was the early part
 in January. If I recall well, when I was 
already in Hungary, Hungary was occupied in
 February by the Germans, ma ybe a later 
part of January but not the early 
part. We  were brought in and ________________ and 
there was a Jewish couple that 
took us in for that evening. It
 was a Friday I think and the 
reason I remember was because there 
was shobotz and they offered us __________. A 
________ is a meal a Jewish meal with beans 
and chicken and carrots
 and all that good 
stuff. It was very good, very tasty. This was the first time  I was exposed to it. I was very 

grateful for it. The following few da ys fr
om __________ because we wanted to g into 

Budapest and that was our goal because from
 the r e on Fessel had his plans. I had my 
plans so once I got into Budapest which we got
 into Budapest within
 a week or so. I don't 
reme mber that period very well, but I reme
mber that we were in Budapest and the 
question was we were not occupied at that ti
me so we were fr ee and I identified myself 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0307  
21 
 
with the Polish organization with all there 
were different refugee camps, not camps but 
offices and you reported yourself that you are one 
of them. Whether they helped us or not 
I don't recall. It was immaterial to me . What I 
wanted to do to identify my self that I am a 
Polish refugee and to be on their books. From 
the r e on it was just a ma tter of finding out 
your level of survival. Where do you go from th
ere. The trigger point was the time when 
the Germans again invaded Hungary. That was the trigger point, be on the run. You had 

to run again, and where to you run. By that
 time I had already met some pe ople, not 
friends, but acquaintances, we became  friends 
because they were in the same shoes. The 
same  problem, where do you run. One thought wa
s to run to get into Turkey. The way 
you could get to Turkey was through Ruma
nia. The other thought was to run to 
Switzerland, means you had to
 go through Austria. Which 
route do you explore. You 
explore them both, but one is less dangerous th
an the other. I felt to be in Switzerland 
would be a good deal to do, but to go you had to
 Austria. That was bad. A better way is to 
go through Turkey through Ruma nia. I had friend
s that became  my friends that were in 
the underground move ment and I joined them. 
Some of these people were mostly Jews. 
Some  Polish, but that didn't  see m that much 
of a difference because 
they all were going 
to run somewhere. I had more trust in 
my Jewish compatriots because the Polish 
underground which was a/k Army Cr awly, was 
a group that I wasn't  sure I would be 
comfortable with, so I we nt with that Jewi
sh group. Even that group, I have some  Polish 
me mbers. I was in a cell. Seven people, we 
had seven people in our cell. I wasn't  given 
orders to carry out. Basically I was a courie
r for them, transferring papers from place to 
place, ma inly from Buddha to Paris and from
 Paris to Buddha and so on. At one time  I 
had to go outside Budapest, but this was a s
hort trip and I came back. One time I had to 
carry a gun to transfer a gun, but I was doing 
some  carry out orders and I felt good about 
it. I'm doing some thing about it. Friends of 
mi ne, they were also printing false papers, 
false birth certificate, false statements of
 good standing of a given community and so on. 
Church papers I mean a lot of things that was needed for anyone especially for Hungarian 

Jews. Not specifically for Polish refugees. We
 we re all saved so called. The question now 
is how do you help out the Hungarian Jews. Th
ey needed the papers. They did not have 
the flexibilities that we did have because we
 were right outside. There was a time that 
they were mostly almost confined to the hous
e ghettos. They alrea
dy had the stars. They 
had to carry, we did not. We were free. I 
happened to get myself
 with the underground 
and they advi sed me  to have two or three re
sident s in Budapest, having a place to live in 
Buddha, in Pess -- in Buddha I had to places 
where to live and when I chose a place to 
live, I used to live always with a Christian 
family. I was safe there. Although I tell you I 
feel at time  whenever there was a knock at 
the door, there was always a heart beat, an 
extra heart beat that
 I have developed later on in my
 life because some body is knocking 
at the door at the wrong time  and ma ybe for 
the right purpose or for the wrong reason as 
far as I am concerned. So, there were time wh
en they were raiding some areas, but this 
was in Gentile areas. I never lived with Jewish
 fa milies, not in Budapest. But there were 
raids just in general and I wa
s one of them, but I never had an occasion to be examined 

and to be found that I had any problems with 
them being either question whether I wa s a 
Gentile or  not. As a matter of fact, I used to go with those families to the church every 

Sunday morning, and to be one of them. It was 
that kind of life that we tried to provide 
papers to the Jewish people in Budapest. Pape
rs, birth certificates, st
atus  ce rtificates and 
so on. Being in Budapest right in the mi dst, 
I'm almost angry with myself not knowing of

______________. I never heard of him, even in the cl
ose circuits that I was that we knew 
how to survive things. No me ntion about Sw
edish consulates and so on. I don't know if I 
would have gone that route, but at least I was 
never exposed to that. Friends of mi ne were 
exposed to Switzerland and they went that r
oute. I understand he ne
ver ma de it. Another 
friend went through to Turkey. It was a pe
rfect Ge ntile couple who had went through a 
reverse of circumcision. They were perf
ect in the physiotomy. They got through 
___________ and through Ruma nia but they we
re torpedoed in the Black Sea I 
understand, so they never ma de it either. I wa
s still there in Buda
pest and the question 
was when I'm going to get out of it and one da
y I have an order to go to Ruma nia because 
I have asked for them to send me  to Ruma ni
a and to get in touc
h with other underground 
in Ruma nia. They send me  and they told me
 who to see, when I get over the boarder, 
what to send them. The question was whethe
r or not the border between Ruma nia and 
Hungary is safe. Of cour se, I was told that 
the reason they are sending me  is to get that 
message to the other side, to Rumania. Later 
on I found out that the r
eason they sent me  
was to find out whether the border was safe. S
o, it was one of those things that you have 
to take your chances. I did not know about that
. I found that on later on when I was sick 
and back in Germany, that I wasn't  told the 
whole truth of the ma tter. Shortly I went out 
from Budapest directly to ______________. I think 
that was the name , that was the city, 
and ____________ I had to pick up those two smuggl
ers who were going to take me  to 
Rumania. The way they identified themselves
 is by folding hands two of them and they 
were there, they were waiting for me . And they took me  and we were not far from 
__________. ___________ was the village I think right
 on the border between Hungary 
and Ruma nia. They took me  to a place to a ba
rn that's all I reme mber, a barn. Apparently 
I didn't sleep all that long and I was so exha
usted I just fell asleep before some one burst 
into that barn and it was the H
ungarian _________. ___________ with the black hats 
with a pheasant feather. From 
there on they interrogated me . I did not have too much with 
me. I didn't  have any mo ney. I had a couple hundred penco, which is mi nima l. I didn't 

have any papers other than my
 own identification paper and 
that's  all I had. I had a few 
photographs that got me  into 
trouble later on, but they were 
mostly interested about my 
spy mi ssion. What was I carrying, why kind of 
me ssage was I carrying to Ruma nia. This 

route by the way was known as a route the Jews
 were fleeing away from Rumania. There 
was one lady that I recognized her as being 
Jewish and she was in that interrogation 

room. They whisked me away from her la
ter on. She was crying. Later on I also saw 
those two smugglers in another circumstances. 
They were beaten very severely. Their 
faces were bl ack and bl ue, so at least from my pr ospective they did not betray me, 

some one betrayed them and in turn I was al
so betrayed. I was inte
rrogated for a number 
of hours. I don't know at what point they tran
sferred me , they deliver me  to the gestapo. 
By the way, from that place they took me  back to _____________ where it was the 

headquarters of gestapo. I was escorted by th
e Hungarian gerdeams. The gerdarms they 
were actually the border police 
but they had some  other special assignment. They were 
the leaders of the police force in Hungary. I stayed in _____________ ma ybe a few days 

and I was again interrogated.  
 

Q: Were you beaten?   

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0307

A: Yes, I was beaten. I was beat
en terribly. In other words th
ey put a bar between your legs 
and then your whole body is 
folded downwards and you're beaten on your feet. Of course 
on the buttocks and so on. It was very painful,
 but I took it. It wasn
't  a big thing that I 
recall it was impossible not to survive. 
They wanted to know again, what was the 
me ssage that I was trying to deliver to Ruma
nia. Being Jewish I dropped my pants, being 
Jewish wasn't  their concern apparently. 
I don't recall that. Whether they took it for 
granted one way or the other, I was never tol
d. The main idea for them was to move me 
as soon as possible back to Budapest and they
 took me  back to Budapest and they put me  
in a political prison on _________________. That was 
the political prison in Budapest 
and I stayed there for a number of we eks or
 months almost. I'm not quite sure how long. 
It was there that I met other some of 
my acquaintances from Budapest. I me t 
___________ who was the ambassador from Hungary to Poland who spoke perfect 

Polish language. I also met across the 
court a lady name  ______________who later on I 
found out she was Hanna _________. She was very resourceful to convey her name  one 

letter after another. There was a time proba
bly that I recall becau
se we were seeing 
____________ at one point in time. It was a peri
od when it was Yom Kippur. It was a 
time that if I want to tag a point it 
was Yom Kippur 1944. ____________ was still alive. 
__________ definitely was still alive because I 
corresponded with him later on after the 
liberation. I was interrogated almost daily 
because not only they wanted to know what 
was my me s sage but the unfortunate thing 
was they found a picture in my possession. A 
fellow that I befriended in Buda
pest who was from Berlin, he
 was also a Je wish refugee 
but for some  other reasons I befriended him a
nd we were dating girls 
together and we had 
fun with him and he was in that prison als
o. They caught him, so they wanted to know 
what was my association with him. So it 
was a complication. I don't know what happened 
to him. I don't re me mbe r  even his name  but he was a very nice fellow. He was a fellow 

that I would feel very comf
ortable to be a friend. Sometim
e later after 1944 I reme mbe r  
we were about to be ready to be moved out of
 this prison and we were told that they are 
going to send us to some  kind of camp. It must have been some time in October because I 

recall I got in, they brought 
us to Auschwitz and it was 
on my birthday, October 29, 1944 
that we walked on that platform. It was a 
train, from a regular train and they brought us 
imme diately to this office. They tattooed
 us. Now, my na me  was 193 229, no longer the 
name  ____________. There was no other name s but 
my number. The time in Auschwitz I 
have very little me mory of it. I did work ther
e. I did get this uniform. I had the cap, with 
the stripe. Whether they gave me  s o me  w
oode n shoes I don't recall. Probably they did, 
ma ybe I did have it. I did have it I think, I di
d have it, the wooden shoes. I was one of the 
inma tes now. I was in one of the barracks, 
surprised that I don't  even reme mber the 
number of the barrack because you must reme mber that. I don't re me mbe r  that. Maybe I 

don't want to reme mber, but we were close 
to that barrack where there wa s a special 
barrack where things were -- a 
punitive barrack and I was told 
to stay away from it, that 
barrack. Not much, I don't think that I was ev
er concerned about being gassed. My only 
question was how do I get out.  
 

Q: You were not there as
 a Jewish prisoner?   
 

A: I'm not sure. I'm not sure if I was a Jewish
 prisoner or not. It seems to me I was among 
Jews so I was a Jewish pr isoner. Until a gi
ven day that a barrack was empty and they 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0307  
24 
 
were selecting people left and 
right, left and right, and they
 select ed me. I think it was a 
left position and then within an hour or so 
they pulled me  back. Took me  back into my 
barrack. It wa s at that time  
that I realized that I am so
me how protected and when they 
look at my tattoo oh you'r e a ____________, that's th
e word that I all of a sudden get to 
my mi nd, a protected inma te, prisoner whatever
. But what I was as a Jewish prisoner or 
not a Jewish prisoner, I was a 
Jew with them and it really di
dn't matter at that time what 
my status was because  I was one of them. One 
major event that I recall wa the hanging of 
five Polish prisoners who escaped Auschwitz
. When they were brought back, they took 
out the whole camp to watch the hanging. Th
at was sometime  probably in December. It 
was awfully cold, very cold and we st ood 
probably until two or three o'clock in the 
morning when the hanging took place and af
ter the hanging normal life proceeded in the 
camp. Then again there's a gap that I don't r
ecall what was going on, just a matter of daily 
consumption of the stale bread. The bread came from the transports from the wagons 

from the trains, but we were given stale bread. 
It was just at  least it was so mething to eat. 
The food wa s very terrible, very thin soup, just 
wa ter. But I was not -- didn't  feel that bad. 
I still felt that I coul d withstand the or deal
s and whatever took place because they were 
talking about soon there's going to be some
 liberation because Russian troops were 
moving in closer and closer. As a ma
tter of fact, our thought was that _____________ 
was already taken. Maybe it was a hope, ma ybe
 it was not, but anyway they were very 
close. So, the recreation of Auschwitz was al
mos t  eminent. January 5, come s to my mi nd 
but I'll stand corrected if it was something el
se. We were evacuated from Auschwitz and 
we walked a long time to another station, and 
I don't recall too well but we were put into 
open carts, only me n. I hadn't seen any wome n, 
and they took us out. A horrible trip, a 
horribl e trip, people were dying because of th
is cold exposure. I had frostbite on both 
feet. They were persistent, I had shoes that were tight and it wa s very trying for me  

personally because I never felt during the whol
e time that I will be able to survive. I 
always felt that I could survive. There was 
a doubt in my mi nd that I could do it because I 
couldn't physically move things the way I 
used to. We  were, the train was moving 
through Czechoslovaki a. I know because I hear
d that and as we were going underneath 
the overpasse s, they were covered with a lot of Czechs and they were throwing bread to 

us in the open cart. It was a good omen. I ha
d a loaf of bread and Leon, a friend of mi ne 

with whom I've been for since Budapest, that
's where I me t him, he was with me  all along 
in the camp. He survived by the way and he 
was in Israel . He saw me  sometime later in 
Munich. He visited me  in the hospital. We  
went out and they ke
pt us moving along from 
place to place. There was no place that th
ey had in mi nd. We  fi nally wound up in 
____________, why ____________ I don't know. Just before we reached 

_________________ they were discarding all the bodies
 from the train and people were 
most of them were that ma jority was alive 
and there were shot on the spot. It was a huge 
mountain of the corpses from the cart. It was molestation. It was all guarded by the SS 

and their henchmen. We  stayed there perhaps a 
few hours, they kept us back and we kept 
on going, and from there on they took us from _____________ to ___________. We  

were told that when we came to Flossenberg th
at we were a sore lot,
 and we were, but we 
survived. ____________, the headings on the sore
s of my fee t , the healed and I don't 
recall what I did in Flossenberg other than 
that I was healthier a
nd a long point in time 
the news came  to Flossenberg that Roosevel
t died and some how President Roosevelt was 
a point of hope to me  as long as he is alive, 
as long as he's  in charge, he was the one who 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0307  
25 
 
actually initiated the coalition a
nd invasion of Europe. When he died a spark left out of 
me because I felt there is not going to be a cont
inuation in the war, but later on a friend of 
mi ne, said another president will take over 
and he'll continue that. Flossenberg was the 
time where it was a step before my liberati
on. I think they took us out on our way to 
Dachau. That's  where we were told an Leon 
disappeared. I don't know
 where he went, my 
friend Leon. There was another fellow, a Ru
ssian fellow who was also an inma te and 
with whom I befriended. He was my friend now
 that I tried to help him out from the 
actions in Flossenberg. It was three days a
nd three nights of that death ma rch towards 
Dachau. April the 23rd we  were liberated by the 
First Army, I think. At that point in time , 
I was liberated. I was a free ma n.
