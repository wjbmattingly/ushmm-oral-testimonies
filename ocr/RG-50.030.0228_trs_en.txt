MARTIN STRAUSS 
May 17, 1991 
 
A: My name  is Martin Strauss. 
 

Q: Where and when were you born? 

 

A: I was born in Germany, Leipzig, on the 14th of July, 1923. 

 

Q: Tell me a little bit about your 
fa mily, when you were growing up. 
 

A: My fa mily were Germa n as far as we can
 research it back into the 1800s in the even 
before 1800. We  were all Germans. My mother came from a little town name d 

Luthenbeck, which is on the River Main. U
h...I know that my  grandfather dealt in 
collecting fat to ma ke soap. We 'r e going 
back into the 1800s. And my father, name d 
Leopold...uh...was born near, which is a little 
town...uh...the area is ca
lled. And his father 
dealt in animals. He wa s a trader of anim
als. My father...uh...grew up and was sent into 
an apprenticeship... uh...at a me rchant, and he 
became a merchant, ev
entually specializing 
in the sale of specialty oils. He had a very in
teresting patent as a ma tter of fact, a patent 
where he...he was the sole distributor of that 
particular oil, made it possible to wash out 
lubricating oils which would sp
ill from the weaving looms from bearings where it should 
lubricate, on to the fabric. And that 
made secondhand fabric which the cloth 
ma nufacturers could not sell. And his oil was th
e only oil in all of Ger many that could be 
washed out, a washable lubricant. And with
 it, he  became extremely successful. Uh...My 
father at age 19 lost his right 
leg in World Wa r I, and because  of that he had received one 
of the early automobiles as a war veteran. There was no anti-Semitism. He was just a 

veteran and he very proudl
y all these years until the...1936-
38 wore his...you know the 
iron cross on his lapel with great pride 
every day. He wouldn't go out without his 
decorations because he was very, very Germ
an. We were...like I am an American today 
with knowing what I have, we...our family, including myself, were very German. We  

routed for the German team to win in the 
Olympics except maybe I'm jumping the gun a 
little bit, but it's interesting because in 1936 when Jesse Owens, the Ame r ican sprint er, 

won several races. I don't know exactly. At th
at time  I was 13 years old. Uh...Germa ny 
said the black ma n is not a human be ing. They
'r e more...or closer to animals and that's 
why he win and that's  why he beat the Germ
ans. That gave me  an awful shock even 
though I knew what anti-Se mitism was but...uh...but 
the fact that Hitler declared the 
black people animals, even as a young kid 
already, I smelled some thing that was very 
distasteful, and I stopped routing for the 
Germans and when I stopped routing for the 
Americans...Germans, and I started rou
ting for the Americans. An interest ing 
psychological thing that ha
ppened in36. We ll..uh...my  
 

Q: Tell me...tell me.. tell me a li
ttle bit about your siblings.  
 

A: Okay. Uh...I had a sister, Marion, whic
h is 8 years younger than I am....uh...born in 
Leipzig also. We  had a very comfortable inco
me . My father was one of the highest tax 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0228  
2 
 
payers connected to you name  it from the 
highest officials in 
the city down to...uh...being 
a...uh..executive...not executive dire
ctor...on the executive board of
 the, which later came  
to haunt hi m because when he was arrestedin 1939, he was arrested because his name  
was on this  roster. Uh...My sister, Marion, an
d I went to school in the 30s. We nt to 
public school until...I am not totally sure 
about the date, but I 
think 1933, 1934, all Jews 
were expelled from public schools. We fe
lt fairly comfortable in the public schools 
except, and that is interesting that the Jewi
sh kids automa tically sat together. Don't ask 
me  how we found each other. Now we were...w
e were 6, 7, 8, 10 year olds. The Jewish 
kids automa tically felt they ought to protect themselves. They ought to sit together. We 

always sit together. And nobody told me  who 
was Jewish and who was not. But until 33, 
34, public school was fairly comfortable. My father and my mother, like all Jewish 

parents, tried to shield the kids from the 
reality. Uh...We  kne w that
 certain things were 
going on. I know that and I reme mbe r  distinc
tly where there were 
shops and store where 
said, Juden. That means 'No Jews. Don't buy he
re.' And I know there were often signs on 
windows, bands on stores, 'Don't . YouJews cannot buy here'. There were 

discrimi nations, but our parent
s didn't want us kids to know or suffer from it. So we 
bought our clothes some  other pl aces. There we
re Jewish warehouses, and we went and 

bought there. But as times went on...until 1936, things were fairly under cover. I mean 

they happened, but I know that more from hist
orical facts than from
 personal experience. 
But after the Olympics, and after Hitler put 
on a good show and because the world came  
to the Olympics in 36...after 36 things dras
tically changed. Whether that was or the 
Nuremberg laws or whatever that was...you c
ouldn't  go to a dentist or any other doctor 

any more, and...uh...Jewish professionals were
 prohibited from practicing and from 
occupying certain... uh...occupations, certain...uh.
..trades. We felt that it was becomi ng 
increasingly diffi cult. 
 
Q: How...how do you...how did the Nuremb
erg laws affect you personally? 
 
A: Uh...Me personally, di rectly, they only affect
ed us because...I'm not sure whether it was 
the Nuremb erg law or not, but we had to ca
ll ourselves...the boys...Martin Israel Strauss, 
add the name  Israel and my sister and my
 mother Sarah. I reme mber one incident 
probably about 1938 or 1939 where I was on my
 bicycle and I ma de a wrong turn of 
some  kind and a policeman ca me  a nd said, "Who are you? " And I sai
d, "Martin Strauss." 
And he said, "Martin Israel Strauss." And I 
said, "Yes, Sir." The identification by saying 
Israel (coughing...excuse me  please) was...uh...it 
didn't say Israel, it said Jew Strauss. 
Martin Jew Strauss. That's  what Israel sai
d. And of course I was 
guilty and I got a...a...a 
fine payable at the police station and...uh...I
'm sure everybody else
 would have gotten 
away with it, but the mi nute it was Martin 
Israel St rauss, you were guilty no ma tter what. 
Uh...And of course, then in 38...let's  go b
ack to 36...I'm sorry. Uh...Schools no longer 
admitted us, or we were thrown out of schools. So the Jewish community created Jewish 

schools, Jewi sh teachers, Jewish learning. And 
we found that very comfor table, us kids, 
simply because we were not harassed. We  were
 not exposed to the...to the gentiles. We 

played football with them and me  being a 
good football at one time created a Hell of a 
fight. Because one party wanted me  a s a good 
football player, and the other party said, 
"We 're not playing with any Jews." So a bi
g fight erupted between the two football teams 
because the Jew Strauss was going to be on th
at team and they didn't want him on that 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0228

team. Uh...These things as
 kids...13, 14, 15 years...leave an
 impression, but they don't 
bother you. It was more important to play foot
ball, than it was the racial incident. And 
that's how we slowly became  accustomed to 
being...let's say...inferior people but living 
with it. It's a system. But then ma ny of 
my father's friends, Thank God, lost their 
occupation and couldn't practice any more a
nd that gave them an impetus to leave 
Germany, thusly saving their lives. But my 
father and ma ny others was quite wealthy, 

very wealthy indeed, and he said, "Hitler is 
going to go away. We 'r e going to wait. Even 
if I cannot sell...sell my oil to many peoplewho would not buy from me, there is still 

some big concerns who want to buy from me
 bec a use I have some thing very special." 
And he said, "We will overcome and we will la
st longer than this nut
, Hitler, will." And 
thusly we stayed. My father being the patriot 
of the fa mily....he had 8 
brothers and sisters, 
followed his example even though they were not
 that well off, but they we re in the 
country and they were farmers and they 
were animal...uh...breeders. They had enough to 
eat, and they were living off the far m, and th
ey didn't need much. They said, "If Leopold 
Strauss doesn't  leave, I don't have to leav
e either." And I am ashame d and with great 
sorrow, I must say that my father to his 
dying day had nightma res of gui lt of not having 
sent his 8 brothers and sisters, their fa
milies and their children out of the country. 
Meaning they all perished. 
There are 24, ma ybe 26. We  are not totally sure. But 24 
confirme d people who died in the Holocaust be
cause they could not l
eave after it was too 
late, meaning 1939. Uh...We  have confirma ti
on of various concentration camps wher e 
they perished. They were 8 brothers and si
sters, their respective spouses, and their 
children amounting to a mi ni mu m of 24 people.
 They are all confirme d. That's  on my 
father's side. On my mother's side, many 
of them escaped because they were smart 
enough to leave. From 36 to 39, which is
 a...uh...period of stre
ngthening, growing anti-
Se mitism, growing laws, growing persecu
tion...uh...they took away automobiles. You 

could not own a car anymore even though I w
ill admit my father was the only one in 
Leipzig who had permission to have an autom
obile because (a) he had lost  his leg in 
World Wa r I. He was a decorated veteran. He 
had connections to city hall, and he was 
permitted to keep an automobile, the only one
 in a city of large proportions. Everybody 
else had to take the street 
car, provided he stands up. You c
ould not sit down in a street 
car. Of course, that leads to little sh
oving ma tches, shouting ma tches...uh...but we got 
used to it. It's  a condition that...that's  so 
unbelievable where the human dignity has been 
taken away from each individual. A little 
chip at a time until the time came that you had 
to walk on the side walk and you couldn't walk on the...on the...you had to walk in the 

gutter because you couldn't  walk on the si
de...sidewalk. And...uh...a li
ttle chip at a time 
until you're just totally de humanized and become  nothing. But it happens st ep by step. It 

isn't a process that happens over night, and if
 I ma y inject a little 
bit of personal thoughts 
on this, the German people also were c
onditioned toward the anti-Semitism, toward 
hitting the people, and they weren't all anti-S
emites at the beginning. Th
ey were taught to 
be anti-Semites. There were newspapers, the Sturme r, which is...I am sure we still have 

records of these, that had propaganda that 
even we, as children, laughed about. But many 
grownups took it as...as the truth. And I...I 
still reme mber about Passover where they 
accused Jews of slaughtering little Gentiles...kids...excuse me  a second please. You can 

edit it out. Uh...Where the the Sturme r, the 
newspaper showed Jews killing kids for 
Pass...for Passover. We  laughed about it. Bu
t I am sure that many other people took it 
serious and accepted it. So life was tolera
bl e because we had enough funds, and lucky 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0228

we...those that didn't have any funds tried to
 get out. All ended up in concentration 
camps. And we'r e getting...I'm sure there...the re are ma ny other periods in between, but 
right now I go to Kristallnacht which...uh...I want
 to retrench then for a second. Uh...We  
had our Jewish schools and we felt very co
mfortable because we were together and 
nobody harassed us when we went to school, and we had a lot of Jewish teachers and we 

studied religion where we coul
d, but we also had a lot of 
Polish Jewish teachers. And 
there came a day...I don't know the exact date
...where suddenly all Polish Jews were 
rounded up by Hitler and his associates, put on tr
ains or on trucks and shoved back into 
Poland. That day I reme mber quite clearly. We
 lost ma ny of our teachers. One thing we 
lost our English teacher. I reme mber 
we lost our Math teacher, the two 
primary...uh...sources of knowledge, and I reme mber
 distinctly the day when it happened. 

The teachers were rounded up, put on trucks
 and shoved out. My teache r...uh...asked me  
to please go to her house and fetch a little su
itcase. We  were very 
close to the teacher. 
She was often at our house, which is the 
custom you know. The teacher is the honored 
person in a...was the honored person, was alwa
ys taken in Fr iday night dinners and so 

forth. Any how...uh...I ran to the teacher's house a
nd got a little suitcase and threw it over 
a fence to her prior to her getting on to a truc
k. And I was  school yard. I fetched her little 
valise with some  stuff that she told me  to 
bring, threw it over the fence, and she had it. 
Whatever it meant. It was totally meaningl
ess, but one of those acts of desperation 
and...uh...she went off to Poland. Some how, it 
is interesting to note she escaped...uh...out 

of Poland, went to England, became teacher in 
England, and now lives in Israel. It was a 
mi racle happened. How she got out I...I don't 
remember. In any event, we lost a great 
deal of our teaching staff, and the school afte
r that was not any more because there we re 
substitute teachers. They were lay...lay t
eachers. The school didn't function like it should. 
Uh...Things got worse and...and harassme nt was
...were on the increase, but our parents 

shielded us. 
 

Q: You me ntioned that be fore...you told me ...w
hy don't you tell me a little bit about your 
Bar Mitzvah, and your Jewish education. 
 

A: Okay. Uh...Of course, like most Ger man Jews (c oughing) Forgive me ...uh...we came 
from a fairly orthodox house. Uh...When Hitle
r decreed in 1934 or thereabouts...the date 
may not be accurate...that no more kosher sla
ughtering was allowed, my mother had to 
ma ke a choice. Either we eat non-kosher f
ood or we don't eat meat, and of course, the 
decision was ma de 'no more meat in the house.
' And my mother woul
d keep it absolutely. 
Nothing doing. No meat. So we became vegetari
ans. Again one of those conditions steps. 
It's not difficult to...to forego meat when it is 
not available, but you have enough to eat. It 
was just one more of those steps that...but w
ith the proper resolve, my mo ther insisted 
that we do not break the laws of kosher. A
nd the reason I reme mber this...because of my 
Bar Mitzvah in 1936...uh...we invited a number of friends. My father was still well 

known in the city, and one of the biggest even
ts of that Bar Mitzvah was that the me nu 
included kosher meat. Where do you get koshe
r meat?  You fly...not fly it, you truck it. I 
guess they...they didn't fly it...from Poland wher
e there was kosher slaughtering, and they 
trucked the meat for the Bar Mitzvah at trem
endous cost because of freezing refrigeration 
was almost not heard of in those days. That 
means it had to be sla
ughtered today, trucked 
tomorrow, to Leipzig to the Bar Mitzvah a
nd a big...I'm not s ure that the kosher meat 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0228  
5 
 
wasn't  more of an attraction than my Bar 
Mitzvah, but it was one of those me morable 
affairs where we had one up on the...uh...on the.
..let's day...Nazis who would not allow us 
to have kosher meat. And the Bar Mitzvah, of 
course, was well attended by all the Jewish 
people. Many of our Gentile friends in 
the upper echelon would not attend, but would 
send gifts. Again, one of those conditioni
ng affairs. We  understand you cannot attend for 
political reasons, but we accept that. Uh...Goi
ng back to 1939, school was very difficult 
and one day, the school is burning. I go to sc
hool in the morning. The school is burning, 
and I didn't understand it because there were 
no fire engines and people were standi ng 
around. No explanation. My father is looking 
for me , and my  mother is looking for me 
and when I walked into the house, they are 
delighted that I'm okay. What I didn't know is 
that Kristallnacht was about to happen. It didn't happen yet.
 Uh...During Kristallnacht, of 
course, we are aware that all the synagogue
s, including ours, the Refor m Synagogue and 
the Orthodox Synagogue, were burned. Some  peopl
e who went in to save some  of the 
scrolls were killed. Uh...Furniture ca
me  flying...during the night came flying out 
windows, that the word Kristallnacht. Uh..Pe
ople, not in uniform, but in civilian 
clothes...I reme mber that distinctly because
 normally the SR, SS were proud to wear the 
uniforms...but when when it came to looting stores and when it came to throwing 

furniture out and robbing households and beati
ng up people, most of these...as a ma tter of 
fact, I don't reme mber any incident where they 
were in...they were in uniform. They were 
all in civilian clothes. And...uh...we went hom
e a nd closed ourselves in, meaning we 
wouldn't open the door for anybody. We would ju
st wait it out sort of. Well, at...at night 
around mi dnight, ma ybe 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning, a knock on the door. Solid knock 

on the door. And three people, 
civilian clothes again, presse
d pass my mother into the 
apartment, and said, "Where is Mr. Strauss?
" "Mr. Strauss was in bed." And we then 
knew that all Hell had broken loose because for one reason or another...and we, to this 

day, don't know, some body called us on the te
lephone and shouted into the telephone,. 
That means 'Run Away.' So some
 nut called us. We didn't know
 how real this was, but 
we know some thing was up. Uh...They go to my father and say, "You're comi ng with us." 
My father said, "Give me  some  ti me . I have 
to put on my artificial leg." So they were 
standing around while my father strapped on his 
artificial leg, and my mother took me  out 
of my little bedroom on the ot
her side  of the house and said, "Up, under the rafters you 

go." She had enough presence of mi nd to hide me . I was 16 years old then. And I 

imme diately went up to the roof under the ra
fters, kept very quiet. Uh...They took my 

father, left my mother, left my sister. And he 
went to the city jail. 
For 3 days we didn't  
know what was happening, what was going on. 
We knew the city was burning. We  knew 
the synagogues were burning...synagogues were
 burning. Fire engi
nes standing by doing 
nothing. We  then knew that this was an o
fficial sanctioned, governme nt. It wasn't  

some thing that happened by coincident on a lo
cal level. We knew then that  it was a 
national scheme . I have to go back now a little bit and tell you about my father's business 

where we had some thing like 10 Gentile employees. Of course, most of these, if not 

everyone of them were me mbers of the SR
...uh...of the party, and some  SS which was 
the...like God. Uh...They were all me mbers of
 the Nazi party. Nevertheless, since my 
father was a good employer, paid tremendous 
wages...when I reflect upon the size of his 
operation, he had his own railroad...uh...uh...appr
oach. You know where...where the tank 
cars would come  to his yard where the oil 
was pumped into his tanks directly from 
railroad cars. He had a substan...very substantial business, and he paid employees 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0228  
6 
 
extremely well. Being an amputee, of cour
se, he had a driver, and the driver...uh...also 
being a party me mber, liked my father, was 
beholden to him. Uh...He was  a party ma n, 
but not a Jew hater because he had experienced a Jew who was decent to him, who paid 
him better than average wages. And that wa
s the salvation and ma ybe the reason we are 

still alive and we are here to talk about it. After 3 days, which is the time that they 

assembled Jews either  in the city jail or
 down a river bank because there wa s so ma ny 

Jews that they couldn't have them all in...in c
ity jails. They drove them down into a river 
bank where they could control 
that you couldn't run away. One side was wa ter. The other 
side was two bridges, and they...they were he
mmed in there prior 
to transportation to 
concentration camps. Back to the chauffeur, the dr
iver of my father's, he went to the city 
jail and said, "I need to extract the Jew 
Strauss." I don't know whether you know Ger man 
me ntality...uh...but in my  opinion, there is a superi
or and there is a follower, and there is 
nothing in between. And if a superior, an officer
, says, "I want the Jew Strauss," and what 
was the life of a Jew. "I want him," and he 
took him out. He was able to extract my father 
from jail and bring him home, and I will never
...never ever, as long as I live, forget my 
father's face after he came out of 3...only 3 days of jail. We 'r e talking about people who 

have been in jail for years and years. My 
father after 3 days had become  a skeleton. His 
face...he was unshaven, of course, and that added to...to the impression. Well, the 

chauffeur took him, brought him to our house, 
and he said, "Mr. Strauss, it's time to get 
out. You have a few days. Try and get out. I'll 
take you to the train and we'll see what we 
can do." Because the chauffeur ha
d our car, and he kept the car. So for a number of days, 
we...the kids...my daughter...my sister and my
self, were home . And my mother and my 
father went out, looked for visa
s to get out. That's  very interesting because the Jews we re 
hunting for visas, and the Nazis were hunting fo
r Jews, so unless they were recognized as 
Jews, they could travel on a street car or go 
to the Consulate and st
and in line and look 
for visas. And we said, "We will go anywhere 
in the world. Just let us get out." There 
was, of course, no way to find out what br
others and sisters we
re doing. Telephones were 
disrupted, disconnected, were lis
tened too. We  couldn't ma ke any calls that amounted to 
anything. And we decide d we will go anywhe
re where we can get a visa. But no visas 
were to be had. Who wa nted us?  The Swiss 
didn't want us. Europeans didn't  want us. 
America...and I bow my  head in shame...hist
ory will show that America had 8,000 visas 
for Ger many in 1939, but not one single, extra 
visa was ever issued to accommodate any 
Jews. And I don't have to go into the history 
of ships arriving to the States and were 

turned back where most of th
e people lost their lives after 
they were turned away from 
the American shores. No visas for America.
 No visas anywhere. The only opportunities 
were either Shanghai, which you could buy. 
For ma rks, you could buy visas for Shanghai 
and ma ny pe ople went to Shanghai. History 
will show you. Then there was Israel. A 
limited amount of visas on the British ma nda
te were availabl e. And then there was 

England, and we were waiting for either one of Shanghai, Israel, or England visas to give 

us permission to leave. And the Israel visa 
came first. Two days later, the England visa 
came, but fa te wanted us to go to Israel or 
Palestine at that time. Uh...the chauffeur took 
us to the railroad, dumpe d us into a car, got 
us to Italy where, at the border line, the 

Germans knowing we had the passports, know
ing that we were immi grating took us 
apart. But taking us apart, I mean literall
y. They took my father's  wooden leg off and 
searched it for money, c ontraband. But we knew 
better than that, because by that time  we 
already had learned our lesson. Uh...They took 
and stripped my mo
ther, totally naked, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0228  
7 
 
and checked in places you w
ouldn't dream of che c king, and th
ey took my  little sister who 
at that time  was an 8 year old kid, and stri
pped her. I don't know ex
actly how much they 
checked her, but I know my mother told me  
that she was totally a
nd utterly checked. And 
then they put us back together again, our lugga
ge and so forth, and we got to Italy. From 
Italy, we got to then Palestine. And, of 
course,...uh...that shaped my life a nd my attitude 
and my...my total thinking. We
 did not know what happened to our relatives. The fact 
that they perished we only found out after the 
war. My father and I went to concentration 
camps, Buc henwald, Dachau. We  looked up 
records and so forth. Uh...I don't know 

whether the following is relevant, but it is in
teresting because  I had changed in my total 
attitude in life, and in Israel I became so
 aware of the fact...we're talking about 1940, 41, 
42...there we re hundreds and thousands of refugees trying to get out of Europe, trying to 

leave concentration camps. Old people that 
had been...had escaped, especially after the 
war ended in 44. There were thousands of Jews
 trying to leave Europe and get to Israel. 
The British ma ndate blocked Israel and 
I became a volunteer, a social worker, a 
photographer, a radio operator...you name  it, 
trying to help in bringing in illegal 

immi grants in addition to the fabulous traini
ng and schooling that I got
 in Haifa. And in 
1947, I got caught by the British again, and for 
3 months I went into a British camp 
called, and...uh...I stayed there because I was a trouble maker, and they told me, " We will 

either take you to Cyprus or you can go 
back to Germany or you can go anywhere you 
want, but we will not let you back into Pales
tine." So...uh...as fate would have it, I had an 
uncle on my  mother's side in New York who gave us a visa, and the German quota was 

totally unused. And here I end again as a 
refugee in New York, welcomed with open 
arms, i mme diately found a job, and again I 
became  not only a...a fairly successful 
businessman. In other words, I earned a lot 
more than I ever thought and hoped I would 
earn. And I become  again a social worker a
nd...uh...I am a mongst other things, Chairman 
of the Russian Resettleme nt Committee of the 
Jewish Social Services agency here in 
Washington, and I have been active there for 25years. And it's  a privilege to be in the 

United States because I am...and this is what 
I, I am a better American or as good as an 
America as my parents. May they rest in
 peace. We'r e Germans because we had the 
opportunity to flourish. We had the opportunity 
to become  citizens. And this is what 
happened to me  in this country, and I appr
eciate what this country's  done for and I 
appreciate the freedom and the freedom of 
the press which was really the...the most 
devastating vehicle with whic
h Hitler was able to brainw
ash the German population. You 
see it in print, you believe it. It's ...it's...uh...ha
rd to define, hard to
 understand, but I think 
it was propaganda machine was the vehicle to 
convince the Germans to do what they did. 
 

Q: Did your family come  to 
the United States with you? 
 

A: No. My...my fa mily. This is another... Can I 
interrupt for a second here. An interesting  of 
the entire story was the fact that my father
 found it very difficult te
mperature heat-wise, 
me ntality-wise to ma ke it in Israel and he
 became very, very poor. We  had...we literally 
sold some of the belongings from my  fath
er to buy a ticket back to Germany. And he 
went in 1950 back to Germany. He s a id, "I ha
ve a lot...lot that th
is country owes me ." 
And he had documentation like any...uh...good businessman, he had certain records 

and...uh...I have for instance the penalty...the 
photograph of the penalties that were 
imposed when Rath was killed by Grynzsp
an...uh...and there was a substantial penalty 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0228  
8 
 
imposed on the Jewish people in all of Ge
r many. Everybody had to pay 20 percent of 
whatever he owned. House, cars...uh...not only 
cash, but 20 percent of what you own as 
payable as a penalty to the German governme
nt because the Ambassador in France was 
killed by Grynzspan. He had those papers a
nd he went back and he said, "Not only do 
you people owe me  the pension that you promised
 me when I lost...and I gave my leg for 
the Fatherland...uh..., I think I'm entitled to my pensions and...uh...we had a house, 

etcetera, etcetera. And I believe
 and a little more research ha
s to be done, that the law of 

restitution was created after my father went 
back and dema nded and had a lawyer pursue 

the restitution. Uh...He went back to Germ
any. He passed away in Germany, and my 
mother passed away in Germany. M y mother
 followed my fa ther. Uh...My sister stayed 
in Israel for a long time . Then she joined me in the United States because I didn't want to 

live alone. And she came to the United States. 
And I'm blessed with two lovely kids and 
grandsons, and it's been a very good country to me. 
 

Q: Let me  just ask a couple more questi
ons. Back...uh...back in Germany, when you were 
growing up and becomi ng...you were still in th
e school, a regular public school, did you 
have non-Jewish friends? 
 

A: Very few. Very few. An interesting thing 
happened during that time
. Uh...In class, there 
was a class given by some Ger man educator  
who was teaching the kids how to recognize 
Jewish features. Of course, that was all a bun
ch of garbage, but so
me how or other darker 
hair and...and bigger noise and stuff like 
this. Anyhow, this is...I reme mbe r  this 
vividly...uh...I was in a Ge rman class and he
 called me  up and says, "Strauss, Come  up 
front." He did not know I was Jewish. Okay?  
And I came up fr ont and he said, "This ma n 
even though he is not Jewish has very Jewish features." And he pointed to my noise and 

my chin and my...etcetera, etcetera. I turned ar
ound to him. I said, "I'm sorry to contradict 
you Sir, but your diagnosis of me  being a Jew is
 correct. I am a Jew." And he was terribly 
embarrassed in front of the class. I was take
n out of the class imme
diately because a Jew 
wasn't  supposed to attend that class in the 
first place. But that was another one of those 

little steps that...uh...for a 14, 15 y
ear old kid, it's embarrassin
g, but it doesn't really tell 
you that...uh...some day I'm out to kill you. So in the German schools until, I would say, 

1933, 1934, we were fairly well tolerated,...uh...but as
 I said before, some  how or other, 
the Jewish kids always sat together. And...uh...I
 think I had one Gentile friend. The rest 

were all Jewi sh. All the time . Maybe it's a 
defense mechanism. Maybe it's distinctively 
some  how...uh...and we always helped each other. 
 

Q: After school, were you involved in...in the 
afternoons, were you i
nvolved in scouting or 
Jewish youth groups or summer camps, those kinds of things. 
 

A: Yes. Yes. We went to summer ca mp s. We
 went to Hebrew school. We  ha d  sports... 
uh...which was...I... I don't think we ever tried 
even into any Gentile environment. It was 
the sheltered environment that our parents bu
ilt for us. Uh...We had a summer ca mp. We 
had the sports camp. We  had...uh...Hebrew classe
s. We were a...a small entity always 
well protected. The Jewish community effort
s were always treme
ndous. And, of course, 
efforts were ma de...uh...t o...to give us strength to
 overcome the insults because as kids we 
only had two mechanisms to defend ourselves. 
Run or fight. And I think we were better 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0228  
9 
 
at running than fighting, which leads me  to 
another story that...uh...mi ght be interesting. 
In 19...the Nuremberg laws I think came  out in 1936. Uh...They decreed that every Jew 
has to turn in every weapon in his or
 her possession. There was a law. And...uh...of 
course, ma ny people had from World Wa r I w
eapons that they brought home , souvenirs, 
sabers, a long saber they carried these trem
endous sabers, and some  had guns and ma ny 
had knives and a law was passed, ﬁNo Jew is 
allowed to have any weapons, any knife 
over a certain length, etcetera, etcetera. Turn them in.ﬂ The regulation was if you don't 

turn it in, you can be punished by death. And if
 my me mories serves me  right...I have to 
be very careful whether it is me mory or
 whether it's written documentation that I 
read...some people were punished. Not only the 
person that didn't turn in the weapon, but 
also the rest of the...of his fa mily. When that
 happened, we all turned in knives and guns, 
what few guns the Jews had, in
cluding my father. That, of 
course, led to a...led to a 
another disaster ma ny years later. When people asked ma ny years later and people says, 

"Why didn't  Jews defend himself...didn't defe
nd themselves." I say, "With what?" We 
turned in everything we had, and...and beside
s the fact that we were brought up as 
peaceful people, the arguments today with th
e National Rifle Associ
ation vis-à-vis the 
right to be arme d is...has much more depth 
to it than meets the eye. This is what 

happened in Germany. And a free press and 
laws passed by a ruler rather than by 
democratic governme nt, all this step by ste
p, led to the deterioration and eventual 
downfall and eventual  murder of 6 million Jews and others. 
 

Q: When you were in Israel...uh...at the hei
ght of the Holocaust, how much...how aware 
were you of what was going on and what...since th
ere wasn't  a lot of immigration at that 
time, what kind of...what were you doing, if 
anything, that did concern the Holocaust. 
 

A: Well, the only thing we knew in 44 really, 
during the war years Is
rael did not know...or I 
did not know...I don't know whether the powers to be in Israel knew very much, but we 

were very concerned in Israel about our ow
n survival. Don't forget. Rommel was within 
400 miles of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. Uh...We
 sa w the flashes of the fighting on the 
horizon. Literally at night we saw the guns bl
azing. Uh...We  were very much concerned 
with where do we go from here?  We  were mu
ch c oncerned with the Arab problems. The 
Arabs were pursuing the Jews and we were
 running around with the Haganah and the 
Underground and...uh...defense me c hanisms  a
nd trying to build things and...uh...and we 
had the air attacks some  ai
r attacks of Ger man and It
alian aircraft...uh...uh...on Israel. The 
Haifa refinery was set ablaze and we  were livi
ng 5 miles from or 10 miles from tanks that 
burned so bright that you could read th
e newspapers...uh... refi neries were ablaze. 

Uh...We  wer e  concerned wit
h...with Arabs whether they we
re friendly or not. Uh...We 
had to...uh...I reme mber when I helped but 
screens on so the stones wouldn't go through 
the windows, we...uh...we were very much concer
ned with our own su
rvival in Israel 
fighting both the Arabs who had declared
 loyalty to...to Germ
any...uh...being concerned 
about the invasion from the West...uh...and maybe 
the news didn't filter up. But in 44, we 
knew immi grants were at the shores and in 44 we knew people comi ng...practically 

swimming across the Mediterrane
an on...on boats that I wouldn't
 cross the Potomac with. 
Uh...They were boats that were loaded so
 they were practically capsized. Uh...I 
reme mber one ship, the Patria, which was a Fr
ench liner, with three or four smoke stacks 
that was loaded with immi grants that  
the British had captured at the...in the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0228  
10 
 
Mediterranean open sea and had...uh...brought to Ha
ifa, and they wanted to deport the 
ship...the passengers to Cyprus. And the ship was scuttled in Haifa Harbor. 

Unfortunately, it wasn't  a very good job becau
se the ship instead of sinking and going 
down slowly...uh...tipped over on its side. It turn
ed turtle, and when it fell over to the 
sides, we had ma ny immigrants they drowne
d. Others came out over the side, and they 
slid down over the hull of 
the ship, which was encrusted with barnacles, and the 
barnacles cut their flesh open while they were 
going into the water. At that time, I was a 
student at the...uh...Naval Academy in Haifa and 
we had passes to get to the Harbor. And 
we went into the Harbor, and we tried to
 rescue some  of the people that had gone 
overboard and into the water.
 And if you don't  think that leaves any...uh... specks in your 

mi nd or any...uh...me mories that change your li
fe, that affect my attitude toward 
people...my relationship with the rest of
 the world...uh...believe me , it does change you. 
But the...the early indications are indeed
 that we did not know during 42, 3 and...42, 43, 
we did not know what happened to the people.
 44 we were keenly aware. The news came  
across. 
 

Q: Now, from what you said before, I 
understand that you me ntioned that you...you 
helped...uh...when...when the ship's illegal im
mi grants came  ashore, you helped the 
people. Can you describe one of those events. 
 

A: Uh...Well, I will describe one of the ev
ents. Uh...Ships came and...uh...tried to...if they 
ma naged to pass the British ship blockade, they
 tried to come  ashore at night, simply by 
beaching the ship. And then everybody helped. Ropes, little boats. The infi rmed, the 

elderly, the kids had to be carried ashor
e through the water, and...uh...one of the last 
occasions wa s a ship that landed not far fr
om Tel Aviv, and the people crawled ashore 

and you just have to help. There isn't...there 
isn't any question of do I or do I not do it. In 
addition to that, I was a photographer. I wa
nted to document these events, and I took 
some  pictures and then suddenly out of now
here, the British showed up from both sides 
and captured all of those who were involved 
in the landing, including me  and my ca me ra 
and on a truck we went and off we went t
o...and they took us...at that time...now it's  the 
West Bank. At that time, it was the. It wa
s called, which was a British camp. In the 
mi ddle of the desert, all it had was some  tent
s. It didn't have any fence around it because 
you couldn't escape. It wa s all desert and the 
only way to escape was along the railroad 
line so anybody that tried to
 escape would wonder around th
e railroad line. In the 
morning, the British woul d take a little Pipe
r Cub, fly around the railroad line, and find 
out whoever was trying to escape and run them back. Uh...So nobody ever escaped. And 

ma ny peopl e did not know where we were. 
My parents didn't...uh...for a period of 8 
weeks, I think, had no idea where the Hell I was cause the British di dn't publish...publish 

anything. And then Jewish Agency got a hold of
 all the prisoners list. We  were better 
than 300 at one time, and my mother read in
 the paper where her son was in the British 
prison camp, and she went to my fat her and 
said, "Now, we know where our son is." 

So...uh... 
 

Q: Were you a me mber of the Haganah at the time? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0228  
11 
 
A: Uh...No, I was not a me mber of the Haga
nah. I was a helper. Whether you...uh...In those 
days, let me  explain to you. Even if you are a me mber of the  Haganah, you not necessary 
know who or where you...you just try to do the 
right thing, and I was not...I was neither 
leader nor...nor...uh...officer. I was the guy that 
was helping. And, of course, it was a 
organized help. It wasn't ...uh...but...uh...we trie
d to do the right thing. I was never 
Underground. I was never. I was never  oranything of that kind. I was a huma nitarian 

that needed to help because I knew my rela
tives could be on that boat. Unfortunately, it 
wasn't  so. 
 

Q: Is there anything else you'd like to add? 

 

A: Yeah. As soon as we finish, I'll probably think of some thing. 

 

Q: Linda had...had a couple of questions. She 
wanted you to talk a 
little bit about...uh...what 
it was like for you when you first come
 to the United States and your... 
 

A: Okay. Good question. (clear
ing throat) Uh...You know the thi
ngs that...that shape you for 
life are your experiences obviously. I came to
 the United States. I had a small box of 
tools and 46 cents. I arrived in New York, and my aunt on a very rainy day picked me  up 

and...uh...took me  in. I slept on the living room 
fl oor, but I was welcome. I was home . I 
was safe. Two days later, I had a job at Co
lumbia University Medical at night and a 

daytime job downtown in the photographic indus
try. I built photographic equipment, both 
for the me dical center as well as in New Yo
rk for the...uh...at that time Time -Life, Ti me  
and Life ma gazine, New York Time s , did all 
the camera repairs, et
cetera, etcetera. But 
the opportunity to come  to a c
ountry...and there's one of the things I will never forget. 

There was this little immi grant coming off the boat, has to go through customs and 
immi gration, and the immi gration officer sa
id...after he opened my passport I had a 
which is not a passport, but is a piece of pa
per that means, "Let him pass," translated. 
Uh...It's a travel document. And the immigr
ation officer opening the travel document 
read my name and he s aid, "Welcome to Am
erica, Mr. Strauss." Those were actua lly the 
first words I heard in the United States from 
a... I t  ma de such a profound impression. It is 
now...this was in 1947, so that is 40... 
 
Q: 44years. 

 

A: 44 years ago, but I can still see the man's face, just as much as I can see the faces of these 
Nazi officers that came to get my fat her. I 
reme mber this officer who said, "Welcome, 
Mr. Strauss." Used my name  and said, "Welco
me to America, Mr. Strauss." Fantastic. 
And quite frankly, it's been going up ever si
nce. And...and therefore I have become  an 
American who... who is politica
lly involved to a certain exte
nt. Uh...Let us say, I am not 
politically involved. I am involved with hum
anitarian efforts. An i mmi grant...you know, 
this is an interesting thing. A Russian Jew and a German Jew, we'r e so far apart because 

the German Jews were...were very prejudice, 
solid, integrated people. They were more 
German than they were Jews. And Russian
 Jews were second...s
econd-class citizens, 
which was, of course, all craziness. But toda
y if I can find a Russian Jew that I can take 
by the hand and give him part of my America a
nd return him to self-sufficiency as a way 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0228  
12 
 
of life, that justifies all the 
efforts and all the hours because it gives you love in return. It 
gives you...uh...dignity. You give away dignity to
 others. The dignity
 that Hitler robbed 
us, the dignity that we didn't have extended 
to us by the British. And here welcome to 
America. This is the country where we...we si
mply we have to do everything we can to 
defend this democracy to make it a better de
mo cracy. Surely, ma ny things that are wr ong. 
 
Q: No. No. Tha t 's  fine. I think we'r e out of tape. 

 

A: Good.We 'r ethrough. 

 

Q: I think they'r e going to put another tape if
 there's anything else that you wa nt to say. 
 

A: Don't you want to show some  
of the pictures that I have. 
 

Q: Yeah. 

 

A: How does that work? 

 

Q: You described how these three me n burst in
to your house and ordered your father to fix 
up...uh...his leg. You know we know your father 
had his leg on and your mother was 

hiding you up in the rafters. Can you describe
 if you can what your
...what your feelings 
were at that time and what
 was going through your head? 
 

A: Okay. Uh...When they burst through the door
, it's like a burglar comi ng into your house. 
Your house is violated. Everybody is terribl
y, terribly scared, and I must admit my 
mother had more wits about her. They were
 not taking any wome n 
that particular... On 
Kristallnacht, they were hunting me n. Men 
and young me n. Uh...And while my father  
put on his leg which was a big procedure. 
It was a wooden leg with straps around the 
shoulders and so forth, my mother left  the 
bedroom. The three people were watching my 
father, but didn't care about my mother. Wh
ether they knew about my existence or 
whether they were not paying attention 
in the confusion, one doesn't  know. Uh...My 
mother immediately took me  to the roof ra
fters and said, "You stay there. Don't do 
anything. Be very quiet." Whether they ever
 asked my mother for me , I doubt it because 
my mother would have told me . They probably 
did not ask her. But the feeling inside of 
me being hunted like an animal is a fear th
at settles in your stomach and a fear for your 
father. We  knew then that all these little st
eps that were taken...the Jews...to discrimi nate, 
the Jews are bad; the Jews are murderers, ha
d come  to a...to an explosion. It finally 
erupted. We  knew that, and...uh...the...the feeli
ng in your stomach almost to a point of 
throwing up the...the being scared feeling 
is one that you will never forget. You 
forget...I...I have a feeling that you ma y forget
 pain. Pain is some thing that goes away, 
but me ntal...being afraid doesn't  go away. It st
ays and I...I still reme mber that. And of 
course my mother was fairly cool and com
pose d and I...she told me  the following story 
amongst other things. Uh...In order to determin
e whether we had played with any funds 
and taken any money illegally out of the country, 
they interrogated my fat her in one room 
and took my  mother into another room a
nd asked them, " Wha t money do you spend for 
household budget every week?" And, of course, 
my parents had all these years tried to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0228  
13 
 
save money and get it Switzerland and get it out
. That was my mother's insistence. So my 
father when asked in hi s mi nd doubled the 
amount in order to account for mi ssing mo ney 
which was a good presence of mi nd. And in orde
r to find out whether he spoke the truth 
these SS officers took my mother into another room and asked her the same  questions. 

And I don't know whether God guided her or
 some thing. She also doubled the amount. 
The two answers, which was not prepared, 
never spoken before...in the interrogation, the 
two answers absolutely agreed. 
 

Q: Had your parents succeeded in getting money out? 

 

A: Yes, my parents had gotten money to Sw
itzerland in...in...from 33 to 39, they were able 
to get at great losses...there were couriers 
that took money to Switzerland. Many of the 

couriers vanished and never showed up ag
ain. But it was a amount of money that my 
father being quite wealthy was able to get out 
and it really helped us 
to live on it for quite 
awhile. But then it eventually all vani shed 
and blew up with the devaluation and etcetera, 
etcetera. But he became from a very rich man, he became a very poor man and part 

of...let me ...let me  sing praise of my moth
er's ...uh...was an extraordinary woma n. We  had 
in Germany in the "good old days" we  had 
servants. I don't mean one. We  had a number 
of servants. And we had a chauffeur and we had a car, we had houseman. We  had a 

housemaid, etcetera, etcetera, and my mother we
nt to Palestine and within l week from 
Germany she scrubbed fl oors in Palestine a
nd she never complained. And she never had 
any compunction about...uh...saying she's unha
ppy. We  were alive. We  had escaped. We 
were grateful for what we had. We  were sa
tisfied. And...uh..it so happens that Israel was 
able to gi ve me a first class education at the 
 in Haifi and I was very
 privileged and this is 
why, again, I support Israel with everything that
 I have. Another story that ma y interest 
you is...uh...when in 1948 Israel was declared 
a state and the war broke out with the 
Arabs, there was a Legation in New York. Isra
el didn't have a embassy then, and I told 
them I a m willing to go back to Israel and fight
 for Israel be ca use I ha
d just arrived in the 
United States. And he said, "Well, we don't have any planes...any place on a...on a plane 

to take you back. You're not important right 
now. But as soon as we have space, we will 
notify you." I'm still waiting for 
them to notify me. (laughing) I'm still here. So this is 
really how it happened, and I me t a l
ovely young lady in Wa shington, got ma rried, 
etcetera, etcetera. 
 

Q: Just a couple more questions. When you were
 at Kristallnacht and your father came  home 
and you were able to get the visas, you 
me ntioned...you describedthe search at the 
border. Can you describe the...what you reme mbe r
 from the train ride from Leipzig to the 
border and then also what happened in Ital
y and...and your feelings
 about running away 
from Ger ma ny and going to Palestine. 
 

A: Uh...When my father got out 
of jail, he again was a free ma
n to a certain extent. Business 
was finished. He called up...it's an interest
ing sideline...he called up some  of the...uh...big 
factories which were really German Aryan fact
ories that, "I have oil...I have a tank car 

full of this and that. I'm willi
ng to give it to you at half pr
ice." And a number of these big 
factories says...said to my father, "Mr. Strauss,
 we do not want to take advantage of your 
mi sfortune." The mi sfort une of being Je
w and having to leave. "We will pay you the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0228  
14 
 
going rate." And it so happens that they bought 
an awful lot of oil which they didn't need 
and they put it in tanks and it 
turned out that during the war,
 they couldn't get any oil and 
they were the lucky...they had helped the Jew, 
but they were the lucky ones, because they 
had oil for ma ny years to come . So t hat's 
one of those...uh...quirky fa
tes that happen in 
life. Uh...I lost my tread. 
 
Q: The leaving...the trying to leave home. 

 

A: Yeah. The departure itself was very drama
tic because when we got to the train and the 
train moved, my father had never cried. I had 
never seen my father 
cry in his life. My 
father cried because...because we knew that it
 was the end of a total existence. A ma n 
who...who was an officer who was a leading citi
zen, a ma n who was respected left with a 
suitcase even though we had some  money in 
Switzerland. We  wasn't  in imme diate danger 
of...of starving. There wasn't . Uh...but we knew 
it was the end of an 
era and my father 
and my mother held each othe
r and cried, but they'r e very 
lucky because they got away. 
Many others never had a chance to cry. Many ot
hers were separated and had to wave to 
each other, including...we have some  reports...the
re was one uncle who picked berries in 
Germany in the woods to feed himself and alle
gedly either wa s shot there or went to a 
concentration camp and was killed there for 
picking berries. Any excuse will do. So my 
fa mily, particular family, was extremely lu
cky to have had the means. Now you will ask 
how come you had the means? 
And I will tell you many did not have the means to escape 
and pay and buy their way out. My father had 
a big apartment house which he had to sell 
under duress, but that apartment house was paid 
for and that gave us after he paid Hitler 
his 20 percent of everything he had, gave us 
still enough money to buy a ticket to get out. 
Many people perished because they could not a
fford the train fare to get out. And once 
we were in Italy...uh...we were able to pay 
for our hotel room. We  got on a ship...on the 
ship legally. The ship called the S.S. Jerusa
lem which was an Italian ship, took us to 
Haifa Harbor where we were welcomed by an 
uncle who took us in, who had rented from 
an Arab an apartment for us. True, we did 
not have any lights and 
electricity and it was 
very bare. I wired the house. It was one of 
those little mi racles that a 17, 16...17 year old 
was able to wire the whole house with electr
icity, and when the insp
ector came, he said, 
"That's not done by a professional. We were 
absolutely worried he would cut us down. 
He said, "It's too neat." So we survived
 the electrical inspect
ion. Uh...But the...the 
shaping of a ma n's dignity, of a ma n's human
itarian attitude toward his fe llow ma n is 
what the Holocaust is all about. If you...if we 
don't learn and pass on to our children what 
we have learned, what I have learned and...b
ecause I am very lucky. I'm here to talk 
about it. Those that have learned the bitterest 
lesson of them all are not
 here to talk about 
it. We  have to take what we can and convey 
and...and ma ke s ure that the next generation 
really understands...uh...what inhumanity to ma n by ma n can be. 
 

Q: One last...uh...one last question. You 
me ntioned...uh...you me ntioned the chauffeur 
who...uh...who helped your father and got your
 father out of...out of the jail and 
 

A: Right. 

 

Q: And then helped get them...take the tr
ain station. Do you remember his name ?

A: Yes. 

 

Q: What is it? 

 

A: The chauffeurs name  wa s Berma, and...uh...he 
was a professional driver who from what 
we hear became  a tank or some  other driver
 in the German army. He perished on the 

Russian front. We  know that from other fello
w employees that we later on spoke in 

Germany to. As a matter of fact, I will be goi
ng to Germany in July, 
and I expect to visit 
my Ger man nanny who is now in her 90s. She is
 still alive. I am s
till keeping touch with 
her. I expect to see her in July to visit he
r for a couple of hours. Of course, they were 
under Russian occupation for ma ny, ma ny years, 
but we kept touch, a
nd we kept greeting 
each other. 
 

Q: So this is the first time you've seen here. 

 

A: First time I going back to my house which is st
ill...still there. Uh...The
 house to the left is 
bombed out. The house to the left...to the right
 is bombed out. Our house is still standing, 
and from photographs I have s
een there, this is 
interesting. There's a carved door, with 
lion heads, wooden carved door. Tremendous door
, and I reme mber it as a kid because of 
I was afraid of these lions' heads on the door
. Wo uld you believe they'r e still there?  The 

same  doors 60 years later?  They'r e still ther
e, and I'm going to see them in July. 
But...uh...I...I want to say to you Germa
ny was poisoned and Germans are guilty 
(coughing) and Germans are guilty, but not all of
 them. There are human beings out there 
that still have retained their righteousness. 
And thank God for these. Otherwise, the world 

would just not have any hope. So we kept in
 touch with most of the employees or ma ny 
of the employees. Most of them are dead by now anyway. 
 

Q: Okay, I think...I think that will wrap 
it up. Thank you. They'r e now going to bring the 
bulletin board out. 
 

A: This is a photograph of my father, Leopold 
Strauss. The interesting thing is (coughing) 
the picture ha sn't  been taken in...roughly 1933. 
You will see the iron cross wearing in his 
lapel. He would never leave the house, neve
r go anywhere unless he would show with 
pride the iron cross he had received in World 
Wa r I, where he also had lost his leg for the 
Fatherland.
