Question: This is United States Holocaust Memorial  Museum interview with Helen Spitzer  
Tichauer, on September seventh -- 

Answer: Oh, seventh -- 

Q: -- the seventh, in New York City, conducted by 
Joan Ringleheim. This is tape number one, 
side A. Sippy. 

A :  Y e s  my  - -  ma d a m?  

Q: I want to ask you a bunch of sh -- sort of
 short -- I don™t know 
whether they™re short 
questions, but they seem -- 

A: How sh -- yeah [indecipherable] 

Q: -- they seem like little -- they 
seem like little questions to me
. So, we™ll see whether -- cause I 
went through all of our conversat
ions, so I have some  s mall ques
tions, and I have some  larger 
questions. So, here™s my first question, okay?  
You said, when you disemb arked, when you got to 

Auschwitz, you disembarked in the town of Os wiecim. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Is that right? 

A: Correct. Out -- outside of St
ohn, I would say, it™s very -- very -- very ofsa town, compared 
like New York, and ma ybe We lfare Island. Yeah, a li
ttle bit. Just close enough, but outside of the 
center of the -- of the town, yeah. There wasn™t 
all -- actually, now, afte
r 50 years, I can even 
show you a ma p which we have produced, togeth
er with the Auschwitz Museum. They have 

asked me the same question, so we produced some little di agram, a map. 

Q: Of where  you disemb arked? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
2 
 
A: Of where  it is in the location, yeah.  
Q: Oh. 

A: It was outside -- I would say 
it was not the railway station, but
 it was the railway station for -- 
for goods, yeah. Like cattle. They have embarked me rchandise, and like here, for example, I 

don™t know how -- how railway stations work [indecipherable] we have people, and we have 

cattle, and we  have all kind of things. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: Now, in Europe, people -- as 
the railway stations in Europe  ar
e small, because they have the 
railway stat ions in -- for little 
cities, and larger cities, concen
trated ma inly for people. And 
everything else is a little bit fa
r out. It stops before the -- before
 the general railway station, so I 
would say a couple of mi les. 

Q: Couple of miles. 

A: And that what happened to us. We  
were not e-embarked -- disembarked? 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Bark?  Embarked, or disembarked? 

Q: Dis-Disembarked. 

A: Disemba r ked where people were used to trav
el, and -- and -- and come  or go, but we were 

disembarked where the cattle -- 

Q: Cattle go. 

A: Right, that was it. 

Q: Let me  -- I™m going to stop the tape for one second. 

A: I-In Auschwitz -- 

Q: Okay, we™re back. Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
3 
 
A: In Auschwitz, I produced -- I had the same  question from the people of the Auschwitz 
museum, so I predi -- produced toge
ther a plan, and the route how we were then walking by foot 
from the place of disemb arking -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- over to the camp in the -- because Auschwitz, one camp where we were taken, there were 

only a couple of -- half a mile -- well
, ish -- well [indeci
pherable] close. 
Q: It was close? 

A: Very close, yeah. 

Q: Tell -- tell me  what your condition was wh
en you got off. You were with a thousand wome n, 
about. 

A: Y -- but today we know we were a little bit le
ss than thousand wome n, but it™s supposed to 
arrive thousand wome n, and some  of the people 
were taking off be fore the -- before the people 
that were put into the cattle
 cars. [indecipherable] ma ybe tw
o or three of thousand girl. 
Q: Uh-huh, right. And do you recall how 
long a trip it was?  A few days?  
A: Oh, that -- 

Q: Or less? 

A: It was for us -- in those days, 
it appeared longer than it really 
was, yeah. We  have been in the 
car at least one night for sure, yeah. And the w
hole day trapped, we embark in late afternoon, so 
we traveled the whole afternoon, th
en we traveled the whole night, 
then we traveled a whole day. 
So that was for sure. Maybe i-if
 -- today I cannot even bet. I s -- reme mbe r  that we arrived on -- 
on Sunday, late afternoon, and we eb -- embarked on a Friday afternoon. So how much is that?  

Tell me. 

Q: From s -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
4 
 
A: Friday afternoon, Saturday -- Fr iday night, Satu
rday, then it must have been Saturday night, 
and over to Sunday. And that -- what it -- what 
it peared -- appeared to me then, I even 
mentioned that in the borders -- borders intervie
w. Today, after 50 years, some how it is -- it was 
shrinking in my mi nd of one day, 
one night, and another day, yea
h. But I don™t remember certain 
night any more, yeah, today. But I d-definitely 
reme mber one night. So, that™s how it goes. 
Q: Do you reme mber the mood that you had on the train? 

A: Pardon?  

Q: The -- your mood. 

A: Food?  

Q: Mood. 

A: Oh, so mood? 

Q: Yes. 

A: There was no mood. Fif -- you know, fi -- we have 
been one week in -- on stage of isolation 
in [indecipherable] point, which wa
s cold, but dronga, on the old f
actory hall. And wi -- we had 
enough to eat, because everybody who was there 
brought some food along from home, so that 

we were living on. They did not supplied us a
ny food. You are not asking an important question, 
but the people some how ma naged to -- ever
ybody had some thing from home, yeah, and 

some how that was our -- that ke
pt us some how in a mood, yea h, 
if you are talking about mood. I 
don™t even reme mber, there was nothing to drink. I don™t remember anything to drink, and we 

went probably the whole week, nothing to drink. 

Q: From the  time you -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- got into Petronka until -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
5 
 
A: No, there was no -- 
Q: -- nothing? 

A: Nothing. There was no food distribution. That 
means whatever we had, ma ybe some fruit or 
so, replaced the -- some water,
 and it was -- there was no mood, it was some  very strange 
situation, because we were -- we -- we  have ne
ver experienced anything 
like that. We went as 
young people to -- to summer ca mp s as children, and 
as teenagers. We  -- they were -- we were 
told we have to -- we will go and do some  work in the fields, or  whatever necessary, because 

there™s no -- not enough ma npower, 
or woma n power, or whatever 
power, work. There -- there is 
not enough of -- there are not enoug
h of people for certain jobs av
ailable, because everybody™s -- 
the ma le are on the front, and the wome n in that --
 to work in factories,
 so do other things, the 
civilians. So we were actually selected to do j
obs wherever we need it -- wherever we are 
needed, yeah. So, nobody was com - -  very excited. 
The war went on, and so what?  But for weeks 
or months we™ll survive and come  ba
ck home, that what we are told.  
Q: So -- 

A: So there was not a -- really 
no -- no mood. Just we have take
n things [indecipherable], we -- 
we realize that some thing must be done, and that
 is what they want us to do, to do some  odd 
jobs, and [indecipherable] 

Q: So there was no suspicion 
about some thing terrible -- 
A: No. 

Q: -- going to happen?  Nothing? 

A: Not at all, not at all. The only people who kne
w about the terrible things which are in front of 
us, were -- was the Jewish community™s board of
 -- the so-called Jewish
 centers, the Juden 
Centrales, they knew that things aren™t going t
oo good for us. But they never disclosed anything. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
6 
 
But I know we know that they knew, after the Wa
nnsee Conference, yeah, what is in fr ont of -- 
what™s in front of the population [indecipherable] 
Q: Right. And you think they knew?  

A: They knew. 

Q: They knew? 

A: They knew. They didn™t know about the gas ch
ambers. They didn™t know about the real f -- 
that -- that factory, beca
use they knew that it doesn™t look go
od for us, but they couldn™t --  
Q: [indecipherable] 

A: -- they said they really didn™t know. Because
 when the first people escaped from Auschwitz, 
those four boys, you know, Wi rbra, Vetsla, Mordav
ich, and Rossi, and when they returned, to 
report, you wouldn™t believe 
it. All Jewish people -- 
Q: Don™t do that. 

A: -- wouldn™t believe. So, that™s why I know a
nd suspect that, you know, they didn™t know the 
real techni ques of Ger mans [indecipherable] 

Q: But when you -- by the time you got on the train -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- to go to Auschwitz, you must have 
been weak, all of you. We re you weak? 

A: Weak? 

Q: Weak? 

A: No. 

Q: You weren™t? 

A: No. 

Q: Even though you weren™t ea
ting much or drinking much? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
7 
 
A: We  are eating or  not, because everybody brought -- 
Q: Brought some thing? 

A: -- some  food along. 

Q: So when you get -- you get in the train -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Is this -- this is a cattle car 
train, or you™re sitting in s -- how 
-- what sort of a train did they 
put you in? 

A: Cattle car trai n. 

Q: Yes. 

A: Sitting on the floor. 

Q: Floor. And did they pack you in, or was it not so bad? 

A: It wasn™t nice. 

Q: Yeah, right. 
A: It wasn™t nice, but even th
at, we couldn™t -- so we were onl
y young girls, you see. The other -- 
other people went with families, husbands and children. 
Q: Right, right. 

A: We  were young people, couldn™t care less. Even
 if it was only with [indecipherable] for to 
work, but not youngsters -- very 
similar to those f-festivals we had, where the youngsters were 
squeezed together, and were happy and singing, yeah? 

Q: Right. 

A: Th-though we were not singing, and we were 
squeezed together, yeah, but it [indecipherable] 
Q: Did people get beaten? 

A: Huh?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
8 
 
Q: Were people beaten, were 
you treated brutally, or not? 
A: No, no, no, they were very careful, very careful not
 to -- not to s -- give 
us any feeling of -- to 
become  sus picious. No, we were just left alone
, I would say. There were
 no guards inside. Yeah, 
they left us alone. No screamings, and no -- no 
beatings, nothing. So first real rough situation 
occurred when we arrived in Auschwitz itself. B
ecause before, on the trip we were -- I think that 
was an combined -- combined operation between th
e guards of the Slovakians, and the Germans. 
The Slovaks took us to the border, 
and after the border, th
e Ger -- the bor -- not 
the border, it™s in 
Poland already, so Germans, they took over. But 
-- so, disembarking went
 very rough, yeah. Un -
- un -- unexplainable rough. Obvious different type
s of people, different uniforms, di fferent 
commands, everything changed, and then we still di
dn™t know what it is all about. So, it took us a 
couple of days to get used, while arriving in Auschwitz, and th -- 
we went through the procedure, 
in the first couple of days. So, that taught us grad
ually, that life -- the prio
r life of ours, is behind 
us, yeah. And -- 
Q: Did you -- 
A: -- we have entered a new world. 

Q: Did you understand German then
?  Did you know -- you knew Ger man. 
A: I have German schools. 

Q: Right. 

A: After the -- 

Q: So, all the girls -- 

A: -- [indecipherable] school -- pardon? 

Q: -- all the girl
s understood German? 
A: No. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
9 
 
Q: No. 
A: But ma ny. 

Q: Many. 

A: The girls -- as most of the girls were from
 our capital city, where -- which is an German 
speaking city, among ot hers. It™s ambu -- multilingual city. But most of the Germ -- of the Jewish 

girls, of course, went to German elementary sc
hools. If nothing else, they went to elementary 
schools, because the German ele m-eleme ntary sc
hools -- the Jewish element-elementary schools 

were German -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- in those days, it was shortly after Worl
d War Two, the people were born, the G-Germans -- 
Q: You mea n World War One, th
ey were born shortly after -- 
A: World War One, correct, sorry. Th-Those girls we
re born, the parents enrolled them in Jewish 
elementary schools because they were good. They 
s -- have just transferred that from the 
Austrian system into the Slovak system. So that 
-- you must realize people,
 like Jewish parents, 
always prefer to send their kids
 to good schools, yeah. They have
 preferred the German, because 
that wa -- the elementary schools had the teacher
s, the language -- I mean the system was already 
established, while the Slovak system had to be
 established. There was not even a Slovak 

gramma tic. It has to be develope
d in those days. But we spoke a
ll -- we had to speak Slovak, and 
the city had a large Hungarian
 population from the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, but the Jewish 
people never -- ne -- in our city, 
Bratislava, never had any -- that
 -- they preferred the German. 
The Hungarian was ma inly in the hands of 
non-Jews, yeah. It was 
the old fa-fashioned m-
monarchies, yeah. We  ha d none -- nothing in
 -- in our community 
like that. So -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
10 
 
Q: So, let me ask you some th -- I just thought 
of this. What were you wearing, on your -- do you 
r e me mb e r ?  
A: It was wi -- it was early -- it was early spring, 
March in Europe, and in 
that part of Poland was 
rough, and cold. So, not knowing where we are go
ing, we all had -- definitely we had no high 
heels. A-As a ma tter of fact, I can show
 you a picture of the shoes which I wore. 
Q: Yes? 

A: Because they were the shoes I have  picked ju
st from prior years, during my -- our times in 
camps, and so on, where I had some  special, very
 good mountain climbing shoes, yeah. I put that 
on, and not knowing -- I knew that we
 are not going into a city, but
 ma ybe into the fields, or 
other [indecipherable] rural areas. So I accordingl
y dressed myself, and shoes were always of 
importance wherever you went, even -- I mean, t
hose shoes, I took the best and most durable, 
strong shoes I had. And as a ma tter of fact, I have
 a picture of those s
hoes [indecipherable]. So, 
what else? And I had on good winter coat, a wool wi
nter coat. I -- and I 
had gloves, and on cover 
of a knitted angora -- kind of an turban, some thi
ng what we wear today, knitted, very nice, in 
dark green, I don™t know if -- in bottle green, I neve
r forget that. So gloves, and the cover of my 
head. No, that was all I reme mber. 

Q: You don™t reme mber were you wearing a skirt? 

A: Ah?  

Q: We re you wearing a skirt, or you were w
earing pants, do you have any -- reme mber ? 
A: N-No, no, I had no -- I™ve a -- I wore skirt and one pullover. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: And mos t  of the other 
wome n that you were with? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
11 
 
A: Similar, very similar. 
Q: Similar dress? 

A: Very similar, yeah. 

Q: And people were not weari
ng high heels, they didn™t. 

A: Oh no, definitely. 

Q: No. You knew, right. 

A: Sporty. Yeah, prepared for some
 -- a rural -- a rural environment. 
Q: Now Sippy, you told me  that you saw a sign -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- when you were walking into the area. The 
sign say, KZ Auschwitz, or Concentration Lager, 
what does it say? 

A: No, that was lots of sign when we we
nt that wa s exactly on the door entrance. 
Q: At the entrance. 
A: At the entrance, and it was hitting me  like 
you would have hit me  over the head. You see, I 
told you that I was an
 trained sandwriter. 
Q: Right. 

A: A graphic artist. I always l
ooked at letters, and signs, and th
at™s why I could reme mber so 
ma ny other things, even now where I don™t see, th
e first thing I™m looking at an area where I am, 
I™m looking at the road signs, and if I cannot see,
 then I™m asking people to read for me. Signs 
are some thing of i mportance. And I was reading 
everythi ng what I could at the entrance. There 
was one little white si gn with black letters. So l
ittle, I would say like an standard Ame r ican -- 
Q: Foot? 

A: Letterhead, [indecipherable] but sheet of -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
12 
 
Q: Paper?  
A: Of paper, yeah. 

Q: Like eight by 11? 

A: Eight by 11, or some thing like that, in white. 
And there was on pr-printed, or painted wording 
-- the wording, it said, Concentrationes Lager. Co
ncentration Ca mp, yeah. No more, and no less. 
I have never -- and that was -- I could not shar
e that with anybody because those gi rls didn™t 
know what it is all about. I had experience 
with ex-Germa n J e ws, who were leaving, and 
Austrian Jews who left, all immi gra nts from a
ll parts of Europe, they were comi ng through our 
city for awhile, and then left again. And they to
ld us what a concentration camp is, because some  
of them were even relieved just under one condi
tion to leave Germany, y
eah. So, I knew that I 
entered an concentration camp, in spite of the f
act that we really we
nt through the door which 
said [indecipherable] fry. There were the stop signs
, hahlt, yeah. All kinds of -- of warning signs, 
and important to the whole entrance of the camp, 
which even today I think you can see. But that 
little sign of concentration camp, 
was there, I don™t know why, it mu
st have been there for the -- 
to the rules, yeah, or to international rules. It 
was there, and I noticed it.
 And then I know I™m in 
a concentration camp. In the beginning, I didn™t --
 we knew that after aw
hile, but the moment I 
entered that gate, I knew where I am. That was an -- 

Q: So that must have been shocking. 

A: It was, yeah.  

Q: Don™t do that. 

A: Yeah. It™s [indecipherable]. I forgot. Yes, it 
wa s. And even then, so we -- look, it was the end 
of our private, previous life, 
we knew that. We  didn™t know what™s
 in front of us, we didn™t know 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
13 
 
how to cope with our past, yeah. But I knew that 
I™m in a concentration camp, from t he very first 
mome nt on.  
Q: In this group that you came in with. 

A: Yeah? 

Q: We re there close friends of yours,
 or these were just acquaintances? 
A: No, it™s -- you could -- look, it wa s funny. 
Nearly everybody knew everybody, but we were 
shifted forward and backward, and pushed around.So if you had a little group of people, two 

mi nutes later you belonged to another group, yeah. 
My very first contact in co -- it™s very 
strange. My very first cont
act with some body whom I have
n™t known before, and some how 
drove -- dr ove us close to each other, was Katya,
 who became then the to
p admi nistrative inmate 
of the wome n™s camp. Katya Singr, now how -- wh
at happened?  While we were still laying on 
the straw, on the floor in that factory hall the fi
rst day, she™s -- had an very deep voice, and that 

woma n started to cry, and to scre
am loud, and crying, and crying -- 
Q: This isn™t -- 

A: -- like an bad baby, yeah. 

Q: This isn™t Petronka? 

A: Nonstop. No, she -- there was a reason to cry, of
 course, we all could have cried, but she just 
cried, no. I went over to her, just
 ask her to stop to cry, we are all in the same  boat, yeah. And 
she has no right to scream, and to cry, and to -- it 
will not help. And I was sitting next  to her, and 
she stopped crying. So we became friends. I was th
e only person who spoke to her, and so then, 
we shared our belongings, the food, until we were put into the cattle car. She was in the same  

cattle car, we stick together some how, as close 
as we could, because I felt I can in-influence her 
in ma king her a little bit more co
mforta -- feel comfortable, a
nd she needed some thing like that, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
14 
 
okay?  Now, while in Birkenau, when we arrive
 -- no, sorry, while in Auschwitz one, when we 
arrive, some how it™s her deep voice, and all that
, she took -- she took control over some of the 
girls in one of the rooms , and was made imme di
ately an Stubendienst  in
 charge of one room. 
After awhile they ma de her charge of the whole 
half of the barrack. And then she asked me  -- yet 
-- but I went out to work. She asked me  if I w
ould like to stay with her, and to help. And I 
refused, because I thought I ge -- 
don™t want to deal with people
. That™s about it. I didn™t know 
how horrible the outer
 work really -- 
Q: You didn™t want to deal 
with people?  What is -- 
A: Yeah, I did not want to deal with 
people, to be in comma nd of people. 
Q: Ah, aha. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Because you would have to do things you didn™t -- 

A: I -- I -- I simply -- it was not 
-- I did -- I have no desire, yeah, 
to tell people what to do, or to 
distribute food, or -- I didn™t like 
it. I wanted to go out to work, and come  back and sleep, yeah. 
In -- but, then I had an acci
dent, a -- a whole chimney -- whil
e we were demolishing houses 
outdoors, an old chimney was falling on my back, and I felt very bad, and I had enough. So I 

approached some body i n charge of work deta
il, of the -- the -- one
 of the wome n of 
Ravensbrück, an Germa n political prisoner, to help
 me  to stay indoors, and if she could, arrange 
some thing. If some body would believe that [indeci
pherable] and that™s 
my profession. And -- 
because I still didn™t want ed to st ay with Katya, yeah. I didn™t wanted to become a blockelteste, 

it™s too [indecipherable] or whatev
er. I simply had no desire. It 
would have been nice if under 
norma l conditions, but not there, where you had 
to be rough, or not even rough, but you had to 
scream, and you had to push people, and all right, 
that was it. Katya, I refused to help her. But 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
15 
 
the other one, whom I approached, she helped me , 
and put me into -- into 
charge of -- s-some  
painting -- 
Q: The painting. 

A: -- the red stripes. That story 
of the red stripe
s you have, correct? 
Q: Right, right, yes. But I want to -- I want to go back a -- a little bit. When -- when you first 

arrived into Auschwitz one. 

A: Yeah? 

Q: Did you go -- you went into barrack 10, or barrack nine? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: One of th -- 

A: Upper -- upper part of barrack nine. Which 
-- all upper parts, which 
most people don™t know, 
admi nistratively, there™s A barr
acks, and the lower part -- 
Q: Wa s the B. 
A: No, no -- 
Q: No. 

A: No A and B, only A. 

Q: A. 

A: Now, block nine, barrack nine was dow
n, and barrack nine A on top, first floor 
[indecipherable] 

Q: Mm-hm. I see. 

A: And 10 the same , and eight the same , the uppe
r ones, they are always the A one. So early 
writings will me ntion the 
A numbers [indecipherable] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
16 
 
Q: And that means the upper, that means -- 
A: Yeah, the extra floors in Auschwitz. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: The upper one was always an A -- A 
-- A [indecipherable] always an A. 

Q: Right. Now you me ntioned to me  that when you first arri
ved, it was clear that nobody knew 
how to organize this camp -- 

A: Nobody. 

Q: -- that  it was completely chaotic. It™s -- 

A: Extremely chaotic. 

Q: And wh -- 

A: Extremely, because -- 

Q: As if they weren™t expecting people? 

A: Who -- who sh -- who expect the people?  They
 never -- people comi ng in by the thousands?  
An transport consisted of thousand men or wome n, yeah. 

Q: Right. 

A: They were used to have first people -- pris
oners from jails, yeah. Poles, or Germans , who 
were transferred out of ja -- from jails to the 
camp. But never transports of certain groups by the 
thousands. And they were -- th -- 
End of Tape One, Side A 
Beginning Ta pe One, Side B 
Q: Tape number one, side B, September seventh, 
with Sippy Tichauer in
 New York  City. Okay, 
so -- so they were not expecting, exce
pt sort of norma l prisoner move me nt? 
A: Correct. And that was the first time th
at the a-a-ar -- arisar --  RSHA -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
17 
 
Q: H-A. 
A: -- transports arrived to Auschwitz, yeah. The 
very first time, so they had no idea how to go 
about, and were trying to leave 
everything to the ex -- to the 
prisoners from Ravensbrück, who 
were specially brought over to Auschwitz to he
lp to organi ze, because they had experience, 
while spending ma ny years prior to
 that transf -- transfer to 
Auschwitz, in Ravensbrück. But 
even they we re not trained, or prepared for 
such ma ss influx of prisoners. So they depended 
practically on whatever we created there by ourse lves. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: If people were -- and -- and the prisoners who 
became, or who wanted to be in charge, they 
had no experience of handling people, or the -- not 
at schools, they were not
 teachers, there were 
no -- so they™re just ordinary hous
e girls, yeah. Never with an -- 
hardly professionals. Some  of 
them had training in -- in office work, yeah. They
 succeeded because eventually the SS started to 
organize, together with the prisoners. I mean, 
food -- food had to be distributed. They didn™t 
know how to go about that. So they had to learn 
how to distribute food, they had to learn by -- by 
experience, day by day, how to go about everythi
ng. So, it wa s not easy, it was in horrible chaos 
for weeks, and weeks, and weeks. And eventual
ly, after months, when 
the relocation of the 
wome n, in August ™44 -- no, ™42, occurred, th-the  relocation to Birkenau, it was still cow -- 

chaotic, but people were alrea
dy used to it. Roll call was -- lasted hours. The SS was never 
trai ned, they were not very intelligent people. Very simple, primitive people, and they s -- 

expected that the inmates will do th
e job, but the inma tes were not tr
ained for such an -- a bi -- 
big ma sses of people to handle. They -- I mean, if 
that would have been -- in the me n™s camp, in 

Auschwitz, it was different. See, you had the pris
oners, the ma le prisoners
, were all ex-Polish 
officers, yeah. They knew how to handle their tr
oops, how to control. They were obey -- they 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
18 
 
obeyed commands, because they were treating each 
other st ill like in the army. But that was the 
difference of the Polish ma le, and the older Ge
rman male, of prisoners, and the wome n, yeah. 
Not because they were more capable, but it wa
s an different background, yeah. We  had -- ma ny 
of the Poles were soldiers, ex-soldi ers. The Germans were ex-soldier s too, or had military 
training, or had the -- were -- 
for example, we had a lot of s 
-- people who were in the Spanish 
Civil Wa r, amongst the Germans. So they had -- 
there wa -- th-there was no problem with the 
German male -- male pr -- with the -- the male 
prisoners in Auschwitz. But the problem occurred 
only among the wome n, because they 
had no -- no military training.  
Q: So that when you were in Auschwitz one -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- what™s going on with the me n is totally diffe
rent from what™s going on with the wo me n? 
A: Yeah, definitely. And there was no contact, an
d that there was an policy from the first day on, 
that if there is any job which a woma n can 
do, in the woma n™ s camp, or the woma n™s section, 
than the woman had -- will have preference. But if they don™t fi nd a woman, then a male will be 

brought over to do the job, yeah. And that™s how I 
got my job, because I had a ma le profession. I 
was the only ma le -- woma n in -- in -- in my c
ountry, in my profession, and when they were 

looking for some body who could mi x paint out of raw ma terial, and produce those red stripes on 

the clothing, which I explained in prior intervie
ws with you, they preferred me , because I was a 
woma n who worked with -- perform in the woman™s camp. If they wouldn™t have found 

anybody, then the ma le would have brought. 

Q: He would have done it. 

A: They would have brought in a -- a ma n to do 
the work. So that was the difference. I -- now 
you understand why we had such an 
hard life in the beginning.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
19 
 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Not because we were wome n, we had -- we had 
no military training, that™s 
what I want to say. 
Q: Sippy, around the area in Auschwitz one, wh
ere you -- where the women were staying -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- was there a barb
ed wire around it? 
A: No, a wall was built. 

Q: A wall? 

A: A wall was built. We  -- we were locat
ed in todays blocks from one to 10. 
Q: Okay. 

A: Yeah, after 10 come s 11, th-the black wall. 
There were the wome n. 
And then, between us, 
parallel with those -- with the w
hole row, there was an wall erected.  
Q: I brought -- I brought so -- 

A: I™ll show you that on the ma p, if you like.  
Q: Yeah, ma ybe we
™ll do it later. 
A: Uh-huh. Let me  see if I can see. What have you ma rked here, neela? 
Q: That™s what I marked, I marked what I think is the women™ s camp. 

A: Now, where™s from one to 11? 

Q: Here. 

A: Where™s11? 

Q: 11 is here. 

A: Good. The wall was here. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
20 
 
Q: Okay. 
A: And whe n we left, they removed the wall. 

Q: They removed the wall. So you 
had, presumably, your own kitchen? 
A: No. 

Q: It™s a separate kitchen, or -- 

A: No, no. 

Q: -- it™s all comi ng -- the food is comi ng 
from the kitchen -- the same  kitchen. 

A: I couldn™t tell you that, because I really couldn
™t te -- no, no, the kitchen was not an separate 
kitchen. 

Q: It wasn™t? 

A: No. There was no kitchen on the ma p, either. 

Q: Right, right. Now, did you get some how register
ed those first couple of
 weeks, or what did 
they do?  They -- 
A: No, we were -- were
 registered very soon. 
Q: You were registered very soon? 

A: Very soon. I would say even after two da
ys or so, only we  we
re not tattooed -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- straight away, but they have then -- we we
re registered. They though
t we were with that 
little apparatus where they press the nu mbers in. 

Q: And it didn™t last. 

A: Which disappeared after awhile
, and then we had to do it with
 the double needle. I explained 
that to you ma ny ti me s, right? 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
21 
 
A: So, we were registered, definitely.  
Q: And the registration was on paper, and they also gave you some  -- some  -- the insignia 

[indecipherable] nothing 

A: The regist ration was all -- that was an e
xperienced -- experienced situation because the 
German concentration camp registration goes back 
to old times, so if you had here an couple of 
wome n wer e  asked several questions, and you 
received your number, 
of course, and you 
received -- so that number you carry thr
ough the rest of your st
ay in the camp.  
Q: And you had to sew this on your -- 

A: Pardon?  

Q: Did you have to sew it on?  
Sew. You have to sew it? 
A: Sure. And th-this -- you see, we had in
 the beginning, Russian uniforms, you know that.  
Q: Yes. 

A: From the r e the Russian prisoners of war. See -- 
Q: And these were pants and a shirt? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Striped? 

A: Pardon?  

Q: Striped? 

A: No, no, no, no. 

Q: No. 

A: The Russians -- 

Q: They didn™t -- 

A: The Russian soldiers in striped unifor m?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
22 
 
Q: No. 
A: Oh look, think. 

Q: No, I™m a ssumi ng they didn™t, but I don™t know. 
When you say Russian uniforms, what is it -- 
what -- 

A: Russian uniform from -- 

Q: The ar -- 

A: -- their prisoners of war. Prisoners -- 

Q: So they™re army uniforms. 

A: Ar my unifor ms, yeah.  

Q: And were they heavy, were they light? 

A: No, they were light, pretty light. So -- th
e Russian uniforms were cloths of cotton, yeah. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And -- but they were sh-sma ll, because they
 have used some  disinfecting technique which 
was shrinking. 

Q: Right. 

A: A steaming, yeah? 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Even the steaming -- steaming of
 -- facilities are stil
l there in Auschwitz, in Birkenau, if you 
go for a visit. 

Q: The -- the big one at the -- 

A: In the back. 

Q: The wa -- in the back. 

A: Yeah, even the machine™s there.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
23 
 
Q: Yeah. 
A: And everything which went in are shrinki
ng. No, anyhow, we had those uniforms, and when 
the uniforms -- when the influx of prisoners -- 
of newcomers, was so big that the Russian 
uniforms wouldn™t last, then they 
introduced civilian clotheses of
 people who brought their stuff. 
They have taken all the stuff away. The good things
 went over to -- transported to Germany, and 
the less good ones were distributed for newcome r s. 
And they have -- they ha
d to be marked with 
the red stripes, and there where my c a reer star
ted, by mi xing the paint and painting the stripes. 
That was the beginning -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- of my r eal artistic -- 

Q: Your career. 

A: -- career . 

Q: No, we™ll get that for a mi nute. Di
 -- were you able to keep your shoes? 
A: Yes, because every time s they were -- some bo
dy wanted to take my shoes away, especially 
with the German wome n, stopped me  constantly, a
nd they wanted to take my shoes off, because 
they looked so good and heavy. But they always too small, I had a small foot, and a small 
number, and not one of the German wome n 
was lucky enough. So I kept those shoes. 
Q: So this was good for you. This was -- 

A: Oh boy, that saved my life in the beginning, in sp
ite of the fact that in
 --   outdoor work, we 
were not allowed to ma r c h to the workplace w
ith shoes, you had to go barefoot. You could only 
use the shoes during working time. 

Q: Why wer e  they doing that? 

A: You ask me  why?  Ask me  why. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
24 
 
Q: And did you have to take them off when you walked back? 
A: Carrying -- carrying the shoes with you, forw
ard, and backward. What is it? Yeah, yeah. 
Q: How soon did they try to tattoo you w
ith a -- those -- that ink stuff that -- 
A: Which one? 

Q: The fi rst time. And it -- 

A: Soon, very soon.  

Q: Soon. 

A: Very soon. 

Q: But I want to know some thing. Were they 
tattooing the me n, or wer e  they experime nt -- 
A: No --  

Q: No. 

A: the me n were tattooed. 

Q: They were? 
A: They were tattooing the me n, and then the men were comi ng over to us, and started to tattoo 
us. 

Q: So how come  it didn™t work?  They had 
men t here for a long time. How come it -- 
A: Wa it a minute, wait a mi nute. They never us
ed those stamp for the me n, yeah. They only 
started us to stamp. Some
body of the SS had an idea. 
Q: That this would be 
easier or  some thing?  
A: Yeah. Bang, bang. But it didn™t work. 

Q: I see. 

A: Then they have send us s-some  man to 
do the tattooing. I was tatt
ooed by -- by a ma n who -- 
whom -- who is still alive. I know him. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
25 
 
Q: And you asked him to do a nice -- 
A: Huh?  

Q: You asked him to do a nice tattoo, yes? 

A: And I told him to ma
ke me  a s ma ller tattoo. 

Q: Small, right. 

A: He was my second cousin, so he obeyed.  

Q: We re you surprised when Katya sort of started 
supervising in this room
, given how frightened 
she was before?  D-Did her behavior in th
e beginning surprise you, that she was -- 
A: That she -- 

Q: Started -- took over like this. 

A: That she had leadership qualities, yeah. 

Q: Yes, was that surprising? 

A: No. 
Q: It wasn™t? 
A: No, no. No, she was comi ng from a non-Jewish 
background, from a n different world, yeah. I 
didn™t know her background, but I 
knew that she -- she was go
od in -- in managing. She was 
ma nage me nt  trade. I think 
I realized that she was trained in ma nageme nt, yeah. 
Q: Really? 

A: Yeah. And she was mo -- good bookkeeper. Sh
e had an good backgrou
nd, and she put -- she 
had so -- understanding of Amer
ican bookkeeping, yeah. For her to 
prepare a new system of roll 
calls, was nothing else like the knowledge of American bookkeeping. 

Q: What do you mean she came from a non-Je
wish background, I thought she was Jewish. 
A: She was -- she had no Jewish education. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
26 
 
Q: Uh-uh, but her parents were 
Jewish?  Or some body was Jewish. 
A: It™s -- we don™t know that. 
Q: We don™t -- I see. 

A: I have -- she did not 
know anything about Judaism.  
Q: Uh-huh. But you had told me  a long time ago that she was Jewish. 

A: She was Jewish. 

Q: Uh-huh. Is it the case -- this 
-- this it seems -- this I wrote 
down some where, that who -- well, 
let me  ask it this way, who was in charge of 
the outside comma ndos?  Wa s it different from the 
people who were in charge of the inside commandos in the beginning? 

A: No, no, no, no, no, no, no. If you have, first of a
ll, the whole structure, you must understand 

that you had an -- the SS structure, from top to bottom, was a military -- military-like business, 

or ma nagerial-like business. You had top 
ma nageme nt, you had mi ddle ma nage me nt , you had 
lower management.  
Q: Right. 
A: And each SS level had their inma te assist ance, yeah? 

Q: Right. 

A: So, if it come s to work, yeah, is a section of
 inside and outside work, belonged to the German 
expression I™m going to use, the Abbatz einsat
z. The work sec -- the section of -- which a-
arranged your employment, yea
h, it was like an employme nt  offi
ce, where there was an SS ma n 
in charge, and an assistant, which was always of
 -- an inmate. The inmate had to expedite the 
orders of his the -- the SS person 
who receives the order from my le
vel, or from -- or from, yeah, 
higher level of s -- he -- of -- I mean, on highe
r authority, which was ne
gotiating this privat e 
companies, for work -- for -- for wer -- ma npowe r . 
If an factory needed workers, 500 wome n, for 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
27 
 
example, especially wome n, they have asked for it,
 then it went over to the top ma n of the SS. 
He was giving the order to the camp, a representa
tive of his command of work det -- work work, 
like an departme nt of work, an office where you-- where you apply for work, yeah? Or an office 
which is -- I don™t know the American word
 of comparison, a civilian comparison -- 
Q: [indecipherable] 

A: -- but it™s an department of 
work. You have -- say you have -- 
Q: So, like an employme nt office. 

A: It™s like an employme nt office.
 We have had in our bu -- camp office, an section of after the 

registration of the newcomers, which went by 
profession, yeah?  So if they were looking for 
people who could sew, or tailors, they need 50 tailo
rs for an factory, they have comi ng to us -- 
Q: To find -- to get them. 

A: -- that we had the -- the re
gistered people under this -- under
 -- the wome n who we re telling 
us when they were regi st ered they we re tailors
, yeah, or dressmakers. So we had our section by 
profession. We had [indecipherable] by professi
on. We  had the [indecipherable] and the -- so 
where -- where am I now, I™m not -- 
I™m lost. What was the question? 
Q: Well, I w -- I -- I think I was -- I was asking 
a question before the camp office is actually 
for mulated. I™m trying to get some  idea of -- 

A: Of who was in charge of
 the indoor and the outdoor. 
Q: Yeah. In the be -- in -- before you had th
e camp office, before it beca -- become s more 
ordered. 

A: Yeah? 

Q: I™m trying to figure out the ki
nd of chaos that you™re describing. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
28 
 
A: So yes, the chaos was settled gradually, 
by introducing the old Germ
an concentration camp 
system of abbatz dinkst
, and abbatz einsatz. 
Q: Mm. 

A: Two people -- two SS sections, 
which were dealing with -- with
 like an employment office, 
and the office was supplied -- 

Q: The people. 

A: The people. Now, if they needed 500 road wo
rkers, they were just 
asking for 500 wome n next 
morning, to be ready to ma rch out. And then they
 were just taking the people from the barracks, 
and -- 

Q: Right, right, right. 

A: -- put 500 together, and off they went. But th
at went always first to
 the SS comma nder, who 
asks them his counterpart of the inma te who was 
in charge of those [indecipherable] and -- and -- 
and the work -- work force, yeah, office. Now we have no words -- I me an I™m -- it™s very hard 
to compare some thing with our civilian life, a
nd our civilian structure.
 I™m trying to be -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- as simple as possible, and to ma ke 
the comparison, so it should go into your head. 
Q: Right. 

A: But does it answer the question? 

Q: Yeah, well let me  ask -- let me  ask it in anot
her way. When -- when you
™re talking about these 
first few mo nths, including th
e time  you™re going out -- 
A: Right. 

Q: -- on the demolition cr ews. 

A: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
29 
 
Q: What™s the effect on you and the wo
me n in b -- in it being so chaotic? 
A: Nothing. 
Q: Nothing? 

A: Nothing. We -- we knew in the morning there 
were -- if you were in on work detail -- on 
constant  work detail, and the SS leader of the wo
rk detail, because each work detail had an SS 
leader, too, in charge, if he was 
happy with you, he ask for you, and you --  
Q: Again? I see. 

A: -- you reported every time -- every morning to 
the same  group of work detail. If you didn™t 
wanted to go, then you were not going, yeah?  
Nobody -- they never knew where you are, and it 

wasn™t big to [indecipherable] what is said on bi
g, big [indecipherable] in the morning after roll 
call, the formation of work details. So 
they just grabbed the people, and -- 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: 500 here, and 600 here, and 30 here, and that 
went e-every day the hunt, it was just like a 
hunt, yeah. I -- well -- 

Q: What was the -- what was the name  of that 
-- the soldier who gave 
you an aspirin after you™d 
injured your [indecipherable] 

A: I didn™t know his  name , but rank was -- 

Q: You told me it was -- 

A: -- finner his rank was an finnerish in German. 

Q: Oh, that™s his rank? 

A: Yeah, because -- 

Q: I thought that™s is his name . 

A: I tell you why, I tell you why. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
30 
 
Q: Yeah. 
A: The inma te who was an kapo, a German woman, is her name  there, Elli -- Elli Meyer? 

Q: Yes, the -- some  -- I have it some where, yes. 

A: She called him her fi nnerish. Now, she coul
d not know his name , or you never a-addressed 
some  SS person by his name , yeah. You called 
the SS people by their ranks. And that was the 
usual thing. So when she said to him a finne
ri, it couldn™t be his name , it was his rank. 
Q: I see. 

A: And I don™t know what™s an finneri, you have 
to look that up in an German dictionary -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- what an finneri means. 

Q: But he got you an aspirin? 

A: And not only that he got me  
an aspirin, he grabbed -- he took me  in his arms , and put me  on 
an -- on an pile of -- of straw, high, yeah. A
nd was looking into his pockets for some thing, and 
took an aspirin. He didn™t even know that you ha
ve to take an Bayer aspirin with water. 
Q: And you went into the infirmary? 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: And is that when this S -- you s -- we
re next to an SS woman, and she hit you? 
A: They hit me -- they hit -- she hit me, and -- 

Q: Because you were next to her? 

A: Because what? 

Q: Because you were next to
 her, or she just -- 
A: She was standing there, in front of the en
trance of the infirmary, and s he was hitting 
everybody, but she caught -- she hit me  badly, a
nd I knew who she was. She was hanged in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
31 
 
Bergen-Belsen, and yeah, yeah, yeah. One of 
he -- her name was Viningher. Folkenrat -- 
Folkenrat. Her ma iden name
 was Viningher. Anyway --- 
Q: Viningher was her -- her ma  -- 
A: No, she was Folkenrat -- 

Q: Folkenrat? 

A: She was known as Folkenrat, yeah. In any cas
e, she was hitting me , and I never returned, and 
that saved my life. 

Q: Because you left?   

A: Because I left. Because those people who we
re admitted, were -- never made it to Birkenau 

during the relocation. So 
I -- I left, and then I approached 
another German woman, and told her 
about my profession. 

Q: So, is this -- what -- approxima tely how ma
ny months were you doing this demolition work, a 
few months ? 
A: Demolition work I did, I would sa y til end of May. 
Q: Til the end of May. And then you went, and 
you said that you have this profession, yeah. 
A: Enough is enough, and I went -- she was in the 
lager aredest, her name  was Ava We igl, an 
woma n from Berlin, and I told her -- 

Q: And it™s W- e-i-g-l, right? 

A: W- e-i-g-l, yeah. Now, she said, ﬁI -- look, 
I know what your profession is, because my 
husband,ﬂ or my lover, whoever he wa s, ﬁhas th
e same  profes sion in Berlin.ﬂ Now, a couple of 
days later, she come s -- wait -- yeah. But she said,ﬁStay at home , don™t go out to work, and if the 

SS woma n Drexel,ﬂ was then in charge of th
e roll call, ﬁif she would ask you why you are at 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
32 
 
home , just tell her that Ava asked me  to stayat home , because she has an job for me in the 
ma king.ﬂ Now -- 

Q: So was that where you recuperated, then?  You just -- 

A: What? 

Q: How did you recuperate? 

A: That was all. 

Q: That was it? 

A: That was it. 

Q: You just stayed there. 

A: I had -- I had no time to recuperate, I have b
een fighting for my life. It was -- I was badly, 
badly hit.  

Q: Yeah, yeah. 

A: In any case, next -- four days later, 
one of the top SS me n was comi ng and looking for 
some body who can mi x paint, and all that, so custom
 that -- it was custom tailored for me , that 
job, yeah. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: And in between newc omers were comi ng in, a
nd the -- the Russian uniform were going to an 

end, and so those clotheses were -- had to be ma rked
 with red stripes. So that was quite an career, 
it started this way, and it was an
 coincident, everythi
ng, that I spoke German, that I approached 
her, and she -- 

Q: At the ri ght time. 

A: At the ri ght time. 

Q: I™m going to stop the tape now, so --

 New York City, with Joan Ringleheim. I 
think we™re okay here. Si ppy, why -- first of a
ll, who was it who wanted
 you to paint the red 
stripe, is it -- 
A: I beg your pardon? 

Q: Who was  the SS who wanted the red stripe? 

A: It was Au me ier. 

Q: And you spell that A-u-w, or A-u-m- e-y-e-r? 

A: No. You can look him up. I 
think it™s A-u-m-e-i-e-r. 
Q: Uh-huh, e-r. Okay, I™ll look that up. 

A: But you can look that up again. He was sentenced -- 

Q: Why did he have -- wa -- oh, go ahead. 
A: Why did he what? 
Q: Why this idea of the red stripe? 

A: Ah. You see, people who are work
ing outdoors in the fields, or wh
erever, if they wear civilian 
clothes, then they could have been taken for a
ny civilian person. If they 
escape, they would have 
been able to mi ngle a mong the 
civilians, and nobody would have known who they are. But being 
marked with an special red stripe, the -- even the ma le -- ma le prisoners, who some  of them, the 

officials had no stripe th -- on uppe
r clothing, they had the dark blue
 jackets, yeah, at wintertime, 
or some  of t hem had -- yeah, dark blue jackets, 
they had the red stripes in the center of their 
jacket, so to be recognized as an inma te. That 
was very, very known in th
e -- in the system of -- 
of concentration camp inma tes, the red stripe -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
35 
 
Q: Suits? 
A: They were ma rked with the red stripe
s from top -- from top to bottom, yeah. 
Q: So this was sort of typical 
in the concentration camp system? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: It was.  

A: Right. If you had something which was not -- 

Q: A uniform.  

A: -- striped -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- then it had to be marked -- 

Q: Marked. 

A: -- to be recognized as inma te. 

Q: So -- so tell -- 
A: Some times the  pants on the sides were ma rked
 with red stripes, yeah. And wome n, well we 
had to distribute to the newcomers,
 civilian clothes, had to be 
ma rked so to distinguish them 
between civilians and -- and inma tes. It was -- 
Q: So tell me -- 

A: Huh?  

Q: Go ahead. 

A: Pardon?  

Q: So te-tell me  what sort of paint did you 
use, so that it would 
adhere to the cloth? 
A: P-P-Paint which does not -- whic
h does not dissolve in water. Some  kind of oil paint with an 
drying agent, to -- to -- 
to dry quick enough, yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
36 
 
Q: H-How long did it take you to figure out 
what -- how to put this paint together? 
A: To what? 

Q: How long did it take you to figur
e out how to put the 
paint together so th
at it would work, or 
did you know --  

A: I didn™t need to figure out, I -- 

Q: You knew? 

A: -- have been an trained painte
r. That was part of our training. 
Q: And who came up wi th the color red? 

A: They. 

Q: They came  up with it? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: It didn™t glow 
in the dark, did it? 
A: No. In those days they -- they were not deve
l -- they had not developed the colors which are 
gl -- no, we -- we have developed that
 glowing business very, very late. 
Q: Late, yes, right. 

A: Yeah. Pretty late. 

Q: So when -- when you first -- when you fi
rst developed this, did you -- were you the only 
person who was painting the stripes? 

A: Yeah, mm-hm. 

Q: So how ma ny wome n do you think you did in a day? 

A: Oh, everyone who had a stripe was ready to 
go to work. Those who had no stripes, couldn™t 

go. The others in dozens, by the hundreds, yeah 
one, two, three, from top to bottom down. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
37 
 
Q: And would this happen at the 
end of a registration process? Is
 that where -- or where would it 
happen?  
A: No, it happened even before the registration, 
the mo ment you received your dress. It depends. 
Sometimes they had -- so they were select ed for 
work, or for work detail, and they were standing 
there, and I had to go from one to -- to -- from 
one to -- and to -- from one to the next, and do the 
whole [indecipherable] the whole group, and then 
some  -- and when there were no people after 
th -- after they went out to work, during the day 
I had -- I -- I had to do th
e stripes in the store, 
and prepare that for the next person who received 
that dr ess of -- as a newcomer, yeah. So, I had 
to make things in stock at the beg -- at the -- 
under -- in the s-stores, where those dresses were 
prepared for newcomers, that I 
did during the day, and -- and wh
en -- when there were -- were 
not enough, and we had more people to go out for wo
rk than we could paint. And supplies, oh, I 
had to do that while standing in -- in -- before 
-- standing outdoors, and I had to do that on their 
body. 
Q: You me a n when they had the -- 
A: But -- yes, but -- 

Q: -- when they had the clothes on? 

A: -- they started -- I star ted actually to
 do that  in the stor e, in the stor e. 
Q: So they would already get clot
hes with the paint on it, al l right. 
A: And they would get the clothes -- clot
hes wi-with the stripes, that™s right. 
Q: So, did this start happening before
 you moved to Birkenau?  Before August? 
A: Oh yeah, oh yeah. 

Q: So, in May?  May - June? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
38 
 
A: It started very soon, very soon. The mo ment
 we had no mo re Russian uniforms to s upply, 
then the -- so me  of the Russians unifor ms appeared 
again, because people were killed in the gas, 
and we received the business back, only the numbers had to be removed, because they were the 
numbers of the dead people. 

Q: Dead people, yeah. So, Sippy, during this time -- 

A: Mm?  

Q: -- they we re gassing in Auschwitz one? 

A: Huh?  

Q: During this time -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- before you moved to Birkenau -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- they™re -- they are 
gassing in Auschwitz one? 
A: That, no, no. 

Q: They™re not? 

A: They were gassing in Birkenau. 

Q: But that in -- 

A: [indecipherable] house. Huh?   

Q: No, no. But before you moved to Birkenau -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- between March and August, is there -- 

A: See, it wa s -- 

Q: -- are there some  gassings? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
39 
 
A: -- it was -- there were rumors, but we -- 
we had no proof. We didn™
t know. We  ha d no -- 
Q: You didn™t know? 
Q: No, we didn™t. We  knew that non-Jews were
 gassed, too, but I can™t -- we -- we don™t know 
where they were gassed, yeah. We  had no sonde
rcommando in our switzwan. So that™s why we 

suspected that even if they have gas in our
 switzwan, the corpse were not burned in our 
switzwan. They were sent -- take 
to Birkenau, yeah, and to -- bur
ned in open pits, or wherever. 
But they did not -- there were -- there were 
never people from the sondercommando working in 
Auschwitz one. 

Q: Auschwitz one. 

A: They only burned the people -- non-Jewish pe
ople who died, and then supplied the urns to 
their relatives, yeah. They were
 dead people, not gassed people. 
Q: Right. 

A: So that is an whole story which has to be 
explored, and to -- read, how they have developed 
their killing process in Auschwitz
 one, and then later in Birk
enau. But all I know is that non-
Jews were gassed, too, yeah, in the beginning. 

Q: In the beginning, right. 

A: Oh yeah. 

Q: Did you believe the rumors? 

A: Of course, we -- we knew that they were gass
ed, because we received their clot hes in -- back 
in the -- after the gassing, with thei r nu mbers.  

Q: So you didn™t think they just died? 

A: [indecipherable] just died -- 

Q: You assume d it was too ma  -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
40 
 
A: -- you see, in the beginning it was very hard 
to -- to control and check rus -- what really 
happened, because there was no even interest in, or
 -- I mean, we had no need to distinguish one 
from the other. If they we re non-Jews, then they 
have returned to earth with some  dirt, so they 
are not even the ashes. But otherwise, I have -- 
I had very little interest
 in the whole business, 
because we have learned of the gassing pretty la
te, yeah. And -- then later, while in Birkenau, 
and while I had been engaged, and I received an
 drawing office in the camp office, and I was 
engaged to pr -- to produce some  diagrams with 
all the movements in the camp -- in the women™s 
camp. He said I had to produce those diagrams w ho were then sent over 
to Berlin. It was only 
then that I became more interest in the gassing 
process, because I had to register the daily 
gassing of wome n in the camp. And that, I re -- I 
had reported every -- every end of the month I 
received some  daily reports of those gassings, and had to enter that on the diagram. So that™s 
why I knew about it, and why some times we ha
d to -- the people who were already pre -- 

prepared us, or -- not prepared, but people who were
 decided o-of their kil
ling, through gas, were 
still alive while I already had to enter them on 
my diagram as -- as dead people, yeah. That 
wasn™t -- that wasn™t bad, the hardest  part of
 it was between the selectio
ns in -- in -- in those 
selections, yeah, not of newcomers, but those wh
o were living in the camp. The selections, the 
transfer to the gas chamber, 
it took some ti me s on whole, ma yb
e 12 hours, but in advance, we 
already had to regi ster them as dead, because 
they were not alive any more, was in the trans-
transfer process. It™s very ha
rd to explain, and hard to -- to
 bel -- to -- to understand the -- 
psychologically how hard it was on 
my system. Couldn™t do much.  
Q: Can you explain how hard it was on you? 

A: Pardon?  

Q: Can you explain how hard it was on you to do that? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
41 
 
A: Who?  
Q: How hard it was for you to do that? 

A: Could you speak a little bit louder? 

Q: Can you explain how hard it was fo
r you to do this?  What did it do to you? 
A: Hard that you had -- that you have known the pe
ople are still alive, and they were registered 
already, had to be registered alr
eady for the next day™s dead, yeah. 
It -- that is hard to explain, 
yeah. Just like I would say compare with you ha
ve in front of you, people who are dying, yeah?  
You only don™t know when they are going to die, 
but they are in the stage of dying. You feel 
very strange while you are still here in front
 of you the living body, and you know they ma y be 
dead tomorrow, or after tomorrow, but they are 
already in -- theoretically, in your mi nd, dead. 

Q: Yeah.  

A: That is more or less the -- the same situation.  

Q: Yeah. 
A: But did you ever ha
ve anything like that? 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Yeah?  You see -- and if you have ma sses of pe
ople, even if you have -- didn™t know them, but 
you have an group of people by the hundreds, yeah, 
some ti me s even healthy ones, and here they 

are, already dead on pape r, and they™re stan
ding outside still on the 
-- on -- on th -- on the 
ground, and are still alive and brea
thing, and -- and -- and don™t know
 that they™re going to be 
dead tomorrow, yeah. That was hard. And just -- 
just like with an dying person who -- whom you 
know, and who -- where you know he is going to die,
 but he doesn™t know, yeah?  Or she doesn™t 
know.  

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
42 
 
A: And it™s some ti me s just a question of
 hours. Niya, is that an comparison? 
Q: Yeah. Yeah, I think so. 
A: Good. 

Q: But let me go back to the painting for a mo ment. 

A: To what? 

Q: Painting. The painting of the stripe. 

A: Oh, you are an artist all of a sudden. 

Q: I want to know f -- you did it for a certain amount of time alone? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: And then you brought in one woman, two 
wome n?  Other people did it as well? 
A: No. 

Q: No?  Only you? 

A: Only me , because I knew -- I knew how to -- to 
paint, how to mi x the paint from raw ma terial, 
yeah. That was on -- some thing you had to learn in 
-- as an professional, and not to -- like an 
housewife who can cook. Within -- it was the diffe
rence like between an chef, and the primitive 
peasant woma n, both c ould cook, yeah? 

Q: Right, right. 

A: But the difference how to cook, is between an 
chef and then -- and th
en any -- any housewife 
can cook, right, or learn to cook, now -- 

Q: But you weren™t the only one
 who put the stripe -- 
A: Yes, I was it. 

Q: You was? 

A: Later on -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
43 
 
Q: Yeah. 
A: -- when I was entrusted with -- of the printing of the numbers -- 

Q: Right. 

A: I trained some  other people to do the st
ripes, but it was me  who mi xed the colors. 
Q: Always. 

A: The paint, yeah. 

Q: Right. And for how long was this done? 

A: All the time. 

Q: All the time . So, if some one
 did not wear a uniform, the 
striped uniform which wa s common, 
they always had the red stripe. 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: But you said that you ne
ver had the red stripe? 
A: Oh yes. 
Q: But yours would re -- you -- yours would come off in the rain?  You -- yes? 
A: I did my red stripes with water -- on a water ba
ses, so that it would come
 off, in case I would 
like to remove it. And I did it before we went on the Dead March, yeah. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Then I got myself a new coat from the [i
ndecipherable] yeah, on other -- on coat, on warm 
coat, I painted the red stripe, which came off in
 no time, and I was prepared for any situation, 
yeah.  

Q: Okay. So let™s -- let™s talk about the camp offi ce. 

A: The camp office? 

Q: Yeah, yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
44 
 
A: Which camp office?  Now listen ve ry carefully. I have here -- 
Q: Not the stopskaboida. 

A: Uh?  

Q: Not the stopskaboida. Yours. Your office. 

A: What are you saying? Not what? 

Q: Not the stopskaboida. 

A: Now wai t  a wi -- wait a mi nute. I have an dilemma. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: There is an group of people who wo
rked, the secretaries for SS people. 
Q: Right. 

A: As secretaries for the Gestapo. Each Gest
apo ma n had one  woma n 
who worked -- was his 
secretary, whom he -- whom had to -- who was fo
rewarned not to disclose anything what they 
are doing, otherwise they are going to be shot. 
It was an -- you must understand, and you will not 
understand, but nevertheless, Auschwitz and Birk
enau had sub-camps -- so-called sub-camps. 
Now, to ma ke you -- give you an idea, those su
b-camps, in our English language they are sub-
camps, but there is no German word for it, yeah. The German system of t he camp in Birkenau 

and Auschwitz, in the German language, in th
eir own language, had two types of sub-camps, 
yeah. That is now hard to explain, but there is no -- again, no word for sub-camps. They were -- 

if I would like -- if you would lik
e me  to translate that by the 
wording, I™m going to give you the 
German na me . There was one type of ca mp wh
i c h was -- one type of sub-camps, which was 
called a branch camp, Zweig lager, and Zweig, 
Z-w-e-i-g, is a branch of a tree, yeah? 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: For example. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
45 
 
Q: Right. 
A: And then there was an othe
r type of camps, of sub-camps
, which were called Abschnitts 
lager, A-b- s-c-h-n-i-t-t-s, Abschnitts lager, th
at means -- abschnitts -- I 
don™t know what -- what 
it means in English. It™s not always wise to 
translate exactly, because some times you get some 
stupid results out of it. But lets ca
ll the other one sub-camp, yeah?  Okay? 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: An Abschnitts mean -- would --  I would even sa
y section, yeah? So what
ever  it is, it is still an 
sub-camp. 

Q: Right. 

A: Only, but we don™t -- but you a
nd all other big shots don™t know, is
 that one of those two were 
always -- the one will belong to one -- the one gr oup, 
even if they were allocated two yards from 
the crematorium, belonged to an -- to heads of 
privilege -- privilege, in -- in commas, yeah?   
Q: Quotes. 
A: In quotes. Not to be exposed for gassing. As a 
ma tter of fac t , they were forbidden to gas the 
people who belonged to those camps. While those 
who were part of th
e section -- what I™m 
calling section, underwent selections and could have
 got -- been gassed. Now come s an example, 
okay?   
Q: Okay. 

A: Let™s go to the wome n™s camp. 

Q: Okay. 

A: Harmens e , Boody, Ricekoff, Sh
topskaboida, B-Beetoogee, were 
all privileged branch camps. 
There™s no history in the Auschw
itz -- there™s no -- no example in the whol e Auschwitz wome n™s 
camp history, that there was ever a selection in 
those sub-camps, which I am calling an branch -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
46 
 
branch camp. Never, there was never in the whol
e history, an selection in Ricekoff, or in 
Harmense, or in Boody, or in the Shtopskiboidi, or -- 
Q: Beetoogee. 

A: In Beetoogee. That is the [indecipherable]
 camp, which was next, between crematorium five 
and four. Good. While the other branch, or the ot
her category of s -- of what am I calling -- 
Q: Don™t do that. 

A: Huh?  

Q: Don™t touch that. 

A: What? 

Q: Don™t touch that. 

A: What?  Ah -- 

Q: You™re touching my mi  -- 

A: -- while the other categor
y, what am I calling that? 
Q: The section. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: You could be gassed. 

A: Could be gassed, there were selections going
 on. For example, to that group belonged the 
sealava, yeah, b-b-b-B1C, B2B -- B -- B1 -- B2B, that was a Czech camp, was a Gypsy camp. 

The C lagers of Czech camps, the Gypsy camp, both camps -- both parts of the wome n™s camp, 

B1A and B1B, but they were -- th
at was a -- no, that was -- forget
 about B1A and B1B, that was 
the main women™s ca mp, and all others belonged 
to us, to B1A, and B1B, up to the wo me n™s 
camp. So, I™ m giving you here a small example why -- yeah, and they were all admi nistered by 

the wome n™ s camp -- camp office.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
47 
 
Q: Sections. The section 
-- what, everything was? 
A: Everything, both sections, and had to report every 
day to the roll call -- 
for the roll call, to our 
camp office. We were the leading admi nistrative entity -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- for the women™s camp. It 
was not the Shtopskaboidas -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- they we re an bloody, unimportant, but 
Laura Shelly brought an -- wa s giving the 
impression if they would have been headquarters 
of everything. They were the SS headquarters, 
yeah. And they -- there was no cola -- col 
-- cooperation or cama raderie among those SS 
secretaries, whatsoever. I have no idea how 
to explain that to the Whit ma n girl. He 
mi sunderstood the whole -- she had -- she was, 
what you are calling in German, spi nning, yeah. 
Now, is that clear, what I explained to you? 

Q: Yes, but not -- 
A: Is that new?  Is that new? 
Q: Yes, that™s -- that -- you ha
ven™t said that to me  before. 

A: Huh?  

Q: You haven™t said that to me  before . 

A: I never said it to you before. 

Q: No, no. 

A: Of course I™d not. 

Q: Right. 

A: How else could I have said 
to you during all those years?But I hope that you understand now, 
better than you would ha
ve understood 10 years ago. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
48 
 
Q: But explain some thing to me . Why -- why w
ould there be a group of privileged prisoners 
from which there would never be 
a selection or a gassing?  Why? 
A: Don™t ask me . 
Q: You don™t know? 

A: I don™t know. You c ouldn™t as
k any -- that -- you couldn™t as
k the system somewhere in 
Berlin why. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: It was actually so -- we  were so sure that  we
 helped our ca -- our friends to be transferred to 
those camps. 

Q:  Right. 

A: Yeah. You were two yards away from cre mat
orium five, and were not all -- and were not 
gassed. Whe r e people had to come  fr om Holland,and from France, and I don™t know -- know 

where from, to -- to be gassed in that
 crematorium, while the camp around -- 
Q: They were not. 

A: -- two yards only, had never one case of selec
tion, yeah. And we knew it, but very few in the 
camp office, ma ybe it was me  and Katya, who knew 
what the real -- and that why we could help. 
That why we were transferring friends constantly
 to those parts of -- of the camp wher e we knew 
they will never be exposed
 to the selection. Okay? 
Q: Yeah. So, is -- 

A: Now, anything to say? 

Q: About this? 

A: Mm-hm. Is that -- that is now 
-- are you surprised what I told you, no? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
49 
 
Q: Yeah, it™s -- in one sense it™s 
surprising, in another sense there 
-- there™s some  recognition that 
there was a certain kind of -- I 
don™t -- I don™t know whether I wa
nt to call it protection going on, 
if you had a certain standing. But that it would be particular commandos is a surprise to me . I 
mean, I understood from what you told me , that havi ng been in the camp  for x numb er of years -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- would mean some t hing to the SS. 

A: No, no. 

Q: No?  

A: No. No, because [indecipherable] so few, 
that you did -- had no -- that means they didn™t 
know who -- who was who, if you have an -- th
at -- what would mean to the SS?  The 
headquarter SS, they can -- they
 had nothing to do with it. 
Q: But in a certain way, this doesn™t ma
ke any sense. Do you know what I me an?   
A: No, it™s just -- 
Q: Do you know what I mean?  Not that the 
s -- the system doesn™t ma ke any sense. 
A: The whole system didn™t -- the whole system
 didn™t make any sense. But I™m telling you now 
some thing which was the real  -- the 
real issue, it -- that was it. 
Q: So how did you -- how did you know?  I mean, at
 what point did it become  clear to you and 
Katya, that these are protected commandos? 
A: From the  beginning. 

Q: From the beginning? Because they didn™t tr
eat those pe ople in the same way they were 
treating other people? 

A: No, we -- we -- we knew -- Katya was close 
to the top SS woma n, o-or ma n who were in 
charge. What are you looking for? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
50 
 
Q: I™m just -- because the tape is going to stop. 
A: Yeah. No, we knew it. I don™t -- I knew it. I 
didn™t even investigated
 why I know it, where 
from. I knew it. So -- 

Q: Okay. Let™s -- let™s stop for a second. This is the end of tape number two, side A. 
End of Tape Two, Side A 
Beginning Ta pe Two, Side B 
Q: This is tape number two, side B, with
 Helen Tichauer, on September seventh. 
A: Look, I give you an example. In ™43, we were 
tr -- always trying fr
om the beginning, once I 
got into the -- into the -- with 
the position of the camp office, how
 I got into the pen -- office is 
another story. 

Q:  Yeah, we™ll talk about that . 

A: Yeah? 

Q: Yeah. 
A: But, once I™ve been in, and I have noticed th
at there are no selecti
ons going on over there, 
yeah, in those camps -- in those part of the cam
p, we have started [inde
cipherable] I was running 
to Katya, Katya, I need a job, 
let -- let™s transfer he
r, let™s do that. So we did it. We  have 
transferred the people to safeguard them, and to 
save them, yeah, into those comma -- into those 
work details. And only once in my lifetime, for 
which I™m even today very unhappy, is that very 
good friends of mi ne, in the begi
nning, when everything was still 
very bad, and the new   art 
[indecipherable] work detail in -- of those br
anch camps were established, and among t hem, one 
was called Boody, and I have helped an lot of girl
s to go to Boody, because we knew it is one of 
the branch camps, and there were never selections in Boody. Unfortunately, some  of the German 
kapos started to ma ssacre the Jewish girls. But 
that had nothing to do with the system, yeah. And 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
51 
 
there were -- I still ha ve so me times sleepless ni gh
ts, because  my best friends wouldn™t be helped, 
yeah. They got killed. So what can I tell you?  
But that™s the only place where they died -- the 
only time they died prematurely, and they were 
not killed by the SS. They were killed by 
German inmates who were in charge there, as
 kapos, and so on. You know the story of Boody. 
But otherwise, you show me  one camp -- sub-camp, 
where there were selections of those I have 
me ntioned to you. Never.  

Q: Did the wo me n kno w when th
ey got there, that that was the case, they su -- 

A: Pardon?  

Q: Did the -- when the wome n got into 
these -- into this -- the branch camps -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: They understood? 

A: They knew they in a good --  

Q: They™re in a good place. 
A: -- they™re in a good place.  
Q: Yeah. 

A: Of course. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: They knew, very muc h so. They are all al
ive, they all survived. I [indecipherable] my 
problems, you know the -- the Whit-Whitman girl, y
eah. She ma de a job out of her paper, and 
telling about the camaraderie, and the solidarit
y, and I don™t know what nonsense about that 
group of people, and they were th
e -- they -- they ar
e all alive, you can ask one by one, if she 
ever had a friend among them. They
 were afraid of each other. 
Q: In these dif -- in these bran
ch camps, or just in sta -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
52 
 
A: No, in -- no, in the Shtopskaboida, yeah. 
Q: In the stop -- in the Shtopskaboida. Yeah. Di
d Susan work in the Shtopskaboida?  She did for 
awhile, right? 

A: Yeah. And ask her about the cama raderie,
 ask her. She™ll laugh into your face. 
Q: Yeah right?  Tell me  about the 
beginning of the camp offi ce. How di -- 
A: Huh?  

Q: How do you reme mb er the camp 
office starting?  How was -- how -- how did it happen that 
you had this tripartite -- 

A: It -- we already had an 
camp offic e  in Auschwitz one. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And there were some  wome n from Ravensbrüc
k, who were engaged in the starting of the 
system, yeah, who keeps the Haupt book. There 
was an -- in each camp they had an ha -- 
principle book, a big one. 
Q: That™s a howt book? 
A: Haupt, yeah, was principle book 
that was in every camp, so they
 had to enter that by day and 
by number, by professions. Whole 
story on one -- one big book, like that. They kept that, then 
they had already ma inly they engaged th -- the --
 i-it was an very, very
 wishy-washy system, and 
when we relocated to Birkenau, there was an 
German woman still in 
charge, but in October 
[indecipherable] September, end of September, 
she was replaced, and obasarin Drexler, who -- 
Q: Drexler, or -- 

A: Drexler. No drek -- 

Q: Drexel.  

A: They calling her Drexler, yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
53 
 
Q: So it isn™t -- I can™t
 figure out who it is. 
A: Drexel. 
Q: It™s Drexel? 

A: Yeah, Drexel, no Drexler. 

Q: Okay, okay. Go ahead. 

A: Uh-huh. As she became  the rapport fuhrering, so 
that was an rank, in charge of the roll calls, 
yeah. 

Q: Drexel? 

A: Pardon?  

Q: Drexel became in charge? 

A: Drexel, in charge. And this charged the -- 
all other wome n, they were -- they were engaged, 
and got herself Katya, to become  the rapport sh
abering. That means, you had an rapport fuhrer, 
or fuhrering to lead that, th
at was always an SS woma n, or an SS ma n, and you had the inma te 
who was then the one who did the job. 

Q: Right. 

A: And I have been, during those couple of w
eeks in September, hospitalized, because I had 
typhus, and all kinds of junk in my body. I was very
 sick. And the whole block was selected, just 
ready to be gassed. And I have b
een taken out as the only one from
 the whole selection of I don™t 
know how ma ny thousand, on that particular day, and 
transferred to the camp office. What is it? 
Q: There™s the phone. We™ve now returned. 

A: Oh yeah. 

Q: We™ve now returned. 

A: They transferred me  immediately to the camp office. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
54 
 
Q: Who  -- who took you out? 
A: The Drexler, and Katya was standing ther
e. Yeah, who took me  out?  The camp leader, 

because hi s secretary was an friend of mi ne, a
nd when she saw me  there on that bi g heap of 
people to be -- just to be taken on the truck, she 
wa s running to him, and a s
king if he would help 
me . Because a couple of weeks before, I used 
to paint some  numbers in his office, on the 
wardrobes for the individual SS me n. 

Q: Right. 

A: But I haven™t finished, because I -- I had to -- 
I was transferred to the 
hospital, and she was an 
-- an -- 

Q: Was her name Honey Yaeger? 

A: Yeah. She -- she was -- she had an yellow and 
purple st ar, because she had an Jewish lover. 
So -- 

Q: And -- 
A: And he was Mueller. 
Q: Mueller. 

A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: Yeah, and his first name ?  

A: Ha -- I think -- no, 
I must look him up. 
Q: Okay. 

A: He only was two mo nths th
ere, two months in the camp. 
Q: And he was -- 

A: He™s a very -- very seldom that he 
is me ntioned in any literature, but I -- 
Q: And why do you think he respond
ed to her, to hon -- to -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
55 
 
A: Because he knew me . 
Q: He knew you. 

A: And she -- he took -- he asked Shtevitz, was 
another famo us SS ma n, to come  over, and to 
check if I am capable to carry on with the work. 
And so he asked me  several things to do, up and 
down the bed, and jumping over the -- what is it? 

Q: A pit?  A ditch? 

A: Ditches, yeah. 

Q: A ditch. 

A: Little he knew that I was an
 very sporty type, and that I 
was used to go up and down the 
ladder, yeah. For me, all that, even as sick as
 I™ve been, was no big deal, yeah. So I passed 

everything he wanted me  to do. 

Q: Even though you we
ren™t feeling well. 
A: Huh?  
Q: Even though you were not feeling well. 
A: I was very sick. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: There come s the ma n who was in charge of 
the selection, and of th
e whole business then, on 
that day, that was that Heinrich Schwartz, an
other SS ma n, a n ugly one. And so when Stevitz 
told him that this Mueller want me  to -- out, he 
said, okay, only if I have no fever. So go to the -- 
they comma nded me  to go over to the hospital sta
tion, and there they had to measure my fever, 
my temperature. Now, I nearly collapsed, but they
 told me  not to worry, because even if I have 
fever, they won™t tell. They took me  int -- so th
ey were selecting the people, the whole barracks, 
complete, even the blockelteste went. And -- no I don™
t think some  of the blockelteste -- no, they 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
56 
 
-- no, they left the blockelteste behind. But what 
happened is that -- that
 Schwartz wacom -- was 
comi ng every five mi nut e. Has she fever, or hasn
't  she?  He was so concerned about one person, 
yeah. And they constantly said, she is not rea
dy yet, not ready. They we
re pumping in me some 
me dication, Bydrian, I reme mber that, and Anna Weiss was the physician. 
Q: Anna We iss? 

A: All -- Olly was there, Gerda Sneider, the whol
e hospital hierarchy, they just assured me  they 
will not sa y that I have fever. And finally, wh
en -- when he returned, and everybody was already 
gone, so he was just waiting for me , so when they 
ask him -- when he asked if I have fever, they 
said no, okay?  And there was an SS ma n, who witn
essed the whole business inside the hospital 
compound. And he was comi ng then, and brought me  pen, and a piece of paper, and said sit 

down and do some  drawing, start to
 work. So I s -- I was totally 
deaf, and blind, and I couldn™t 
reme mber the letters, how they looked. I was to
t -- look, I was out of the world, with high fever. 
So I said, ﬁBut I don™t know how the letter l
ooks.ﬂ He said, ﬁDo whatever you want.ﬂ You know, 
if I would have today be able to
 keep that, what I draw, it would 
have been a wonderful analysis 
for some  of those psychiatrists,
 yeah. The results of my -- the 
condition, and the results of my 
whole situation, and what I did. In any case, 
the mome nt all everythi
ng was gone, I had my -- 
yeah, and the SS ma n said to me , ﬁLook, do anythi
ng you want, but just work.ﬂ So okay, I did -- 

I don™t know what I did, but after awhile the do
or opens, in come s Katy
a, and [indecipherable] 
and Drexel, with an sheet of pape
r in the hand to transfer into 
the camp offi ce. And that was the 
beginning of my career. Two months  
later, Mandel arrive
d as an oboffsairen, yeah, in charge of 
the whole camp, and Mandel cat -- 
wa s really -- respected me  fr
om the first day on, and made 
my life very tolerable. He r boyfriend was in charge of the bowlightung of the camp - -  building 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
57 
 
office, yeah. And he established me  my drawing office. He supplied me  with wonderful 
instrume nts, and ma terial, and -- 

Q: What did she see in you? 

A: Huh?  

Q: What did she see in you, do you think?  Why - -  

A: I was the one who was [indecipherable] it™s
 the only one, and she 
didn™t know why. The only 
one from the whole thousands and thousand of people, yeah. And she couldn™t -- she didn™t know 

why. 

Q: She didn™t know why. 

A: She didn™t know why. But they -- 

Q: How -- how was she with other pe
ople?  Wa s she a very cruel person? 
A: She was an very beautiful woma n. I wouldn™
t say she was cruel, no. But she didn™t like the 

prostitutes, the German prostitutes. She didn™t 
liked -- she liked -- I don™t
 know what she liked. I 
don™t know why she liked me . 

Q: But sh -- but she liked you. 

A: I will never forget -- yeah, I helped to orga
ni ze the orchestra too, during -- under her -- under 
her time . When she noticed that I™m artist by prof
ession, that I™m a musician, so she -- she -- and 
I spoke good German, a nd so once she called me  and asked me  to put an dedication in an book. 

So th -- I noticed she ma de another SS ma n an bi
rthday present, but normally, I don™t know what 
people are -- what the SS was giving each other.
 She ma de him a present of books. So I was 
starting to think, yeah, that was one quality whic
h I never expected, yeah. And asking me  to put 
an dedication in. And on that day, 
I noticed -- I said, but [indeciphera
ble] that is my birthday too, 
yeah, on the same  day. So she said, ﬁOh, so go [ind
ecipherable] you have an sheet of paper, go to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
58 
 
the package room, and get yourself the biggest 
parcel they have.ﬂ Yeah. And do you know who 
was in charge then, already, in the package room?  That SS woma n who -- 
Q: Who slapped you? 

A: Who so she started to respect me. 

Q: You too. What was Drexel like? 

A: Ugly. Oy, was she ugly. And she want -- she 
ask me -- Katya is standi ng there, and I was 
comi ng, and walking, and she called me  back. You™re
 short -- your dresses 
are too short. I want 
to see you tomorrow with I don™t 
know how ma ny inches longer, 
and wanted to hit me . And I 
was running away. I don™t know what happened to 
-- she could have shot me , yeah. And Katya 
c-come s later on and said, ﬁSippy, you know
 she -- she complained that Si ppy™s 
[indecipherable].ﬂ She was running away from me
, and I wanted to hit her. So, I don™t know 
what Drexel was. She was -- I noticed that she 
did selections, she partic
ipated in selections, 
while Mandel did not. But Mandel once signed an sh
eet of selected paper, and because of that 
she was hanged. So. 

Q: Uh-huh. [inaudible] 

A: Look, it was an very hard -- well, it was very 
hard to understand, what really went on in the 
mi nd of the -- that Mandel woma n, t hat she had, as 
an partner, an h-high o
fficial, and an trained -
- an engineer -- an engineer by 
profession, or an architect. And 
she -- as I had me ntioned to you, 
that was an sign of -- on bit of an higher level 
--  mentally higher level than all ot hers, while 
giving another SS ma n a book as an present, y
eah, for a birthday. But would -- how would you 
have judged that?  That they
 were thinking different. 
Q: Differently. 

A: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
59 
 
Q: Yeah. 
A: She was from Austria, but with her, I had goo
d luck. In -- at the end of ™44, there was an 
friend. The Germans wa nted to establish the bi
ggest wome n™s concentration camp in the world, 

in -- not too far from Da chau, yeah, in Kaufer
ing. And we have heard about it, and Mandel 
should have become  the biggest sh
ot -- big shot of the biggest 
concentration camp on earth. So 
sh-she selected some  of the Auschwitz people 
which she wanted to take along with her, and 
nobody from the camp office, and nobody knew what™s
 going to happen, whom she™s going to 
take. It would have been an advantage, because 
there would have been no crematorium, yeah. So 
they prepared a list whom she selected in th
e camp office. We had 
one typewriter, and one 
woma n typed the list. So I wanted to know if I am
 on the list, because it wa
s, after all, an big 
event to leave Auschwitz, and join the staff of 
the biggest SS woma n in the world. And -- but the 
woma n who produced the list was mean, and didn™t 
wanted to tell us. So, what am I doing, the 
list was prepared, and it went to Berlin. And while 
she was carrying the list  to deliver  the list, I 
went into the wastepaper basket
, and there were some  carbon pape
r. So I™ve been on the list. 
Q: Yes. 

A: Yeah.  

Q: And Katya was on the list? 

A: Katya was already gone, because she had an 
affair with an SS ma n, and was -- disappeared 

from the earth of -- from the f
ace of the earth. Katya was stupid, because I didn™t know that she 
had the affair. He was comi ng there to the office 
to visit, every day. And I went over to Katya, 
and I said, ﬁKatya, who is he?  Who is he? ﬂ  What
 is -- no, I did-didn™t sa
id who is he. ﬁKatya, 
what is he doing here?ﬂ She said, ﬁHe™s comi ng to 
visit me .ﬂ Her. I said, ﬁKatya, that™s an ma ss 
murderer.ﬂ She looked at me . I noticed him shu -- sh
 -- killing the people at the black wall, from 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
60 
 
I visited while still in Auschwitz, I we nt fromblock nine to block 10. There are still today the 
wooden -- wooden timbers, yeah. But in betw
een the timbers you could look. And I have 
witnessed the execution of hundred
s and hundreds of people, which 
he performe d. And I said to 
her, ﬁKatya, that™s a ma ss murderer.ﬂ She never 
said anything to me . Our relationship went -- 
slowly cooled off, yeah, because of that. And th
en she was arrested, put into the bunker, and was 
sent away, and he was sent to the front. So not
hing really happened between
 the two of -- he was 
killed, and she was stupid enough to risk her goo
d life she had. She had an important -- she had 
an important life to car -- to -- to lead in Auschw
itz. She could help, she 
could do a lot of things. 
And all for an SS ma n who was really a ma ss mu rder
er . But I™ m glad that I told her that in my 
lifetime. I was honest enough to forewarn her, yeah. 

Q: And wha t  happened to her in the end? 

A: She died.  

Q: She died. In Auschwitz? Or she was sent away? 
A: No, she -- she was sent away, but she 
survived. We  have me t after the war.  
Q: Yeah. 
A: She visited me , I visited her in ™75 in Prague
, but she died of an -- 
of an kidney failure. 
Q: Did you talk about it after the war?
 What she was -- what she had done? 
A: Oh, every second that I have -- I ha
ve on record -- not a record, a tape. 
Q: Tape?  

A: I have sent Susan -- 

Q: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
61 
 
A: -- over to visit her, and she 
didn™t wanted to speak to anybody, 
but when I told her that I™m 
sending somebody and she reme mbe r s Susan a little 
bit. So, this Susan was stupid. Instead to 
letting her talk -- 
Q: Susan would talk. 

A: -- Susan was talking all the time. Not -- of -- in 
any case, that™s the st or
y of my -- my entrance 
to the camp office, and it was relatively an im
portant job, and we could 
do a lot, yeah, and we 
were helping a lot.  

Q: Who decided that the -- the dr awing 
office would be created?  Who ma de -- 
A: Mandel. 

Q: Mandel?  She thought of the idea?  
Because she knew what you could do? 
A: She knew what I could do, and her lover was an ar
chitect, in charge of th
e architectural office, 
of whole Auschwitz, yeah. I had equipment and 
ma terial, and whatever I want. I had a good life 
in that drawing office. It was an independe
nt, no competition. Nobody wa s giving me  the order 
except she, yeah.  

Q: Not even Katya, so it was you directly. 

A: Katya yes, but they -- 

Q: Together. 

A: -- knew what I™m doing, and 
[indecipherable], as some times SS wome n were comi ng with a 
little of work, yeah. And -- but it became  too mu c
h, yeah. I tried to s -- 
to satisfy everybody, but 
then it became  too muc h, and I complained
 to Mandel, said, ﬁI don™t know what to do. 
Everybody™s comi ng, and wants some little work, 
and I cannot fulfill, I cannot do everything.ﬂ 
She said, ﬁOkay,ﬂ said, ﬁif anybody come s in future, 
just tell her or him to see me first.ﬂ That 
was the end, yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
62 
 
Q: Tell me -- 
A: I could talk to her, that was funny, yeah. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: And she was the one, when she was arreste
d, she was Catholic, one of the Polish woma n -- 
and I™ll show you on some  photograph. She is in 
that book too, ﬁFighting 
Auschwitz.ﬂ One of 
that woma n was arrest ed after the war by the Po
lish Communists, and sent
enced to death because 
of her anti-governme nt feeling. A
nd they put her together with Mandel in one cell. So, they had 
enough time to exchange their views and so on. Andthen Mandel one day ask her -- even what™s 

his name , Lankban describes the whole affair 
in his book, too. One day, Mandel ask her if she 
would forgive her. So both were Catholics.
 She said, ﬁLook, why are you asking me ?  I forgive 
you, but He upstairs, it™s up to Him.ﬂ  So that 
was authentic, and she told me  the story, too. 
Rachwalova was her name . Mande
l ask her to forgive her. 
Q: What was the woma n™s name ?  Raquel? 
A: Rachwalova. 
Q: Rach? 

A: Rachwalova. 

Q: Rachwalova. That™s her last name? 

A: R-a-c-h-w-a-l-o-v-a. 
I forgot her f-f -- her first name , my
 God. I have a photo here with her, 
we have me t  after the war. A
nd it™s in fighting for -- ﬁFigh
ting Auschwitz.ﬂ She™s in the 
literat ure at  Forenzia. 

Q: Katya -- 

A: Huh?  

Q: How do you spell Katya™s last name , with a Z, or an S?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
63 
 
A: Wa s S. 
Q: An S. 

A: S-i-n-g-r.

Q: United States Holocaust Memorial Museum -- 

A: Uh-huh. 

Q: -- interview with Helen Tichauer, on Septem
ber seventh, 2000, in New York City, conducted 
by Joan Ringleheim. We  were talking about th
e beginnings of the w -- the camp offi ce. The 
camp office actually was in some  wa y in existenc
e in Auschwitz one, and it moves to Birkenau, 
yes?  

A: Yeah. 

Q: Is Katya working on it in Auschwitz one? 

A: No. 

Q: No. 

A: Katya was there on blockelteste. 

Q: Okay. 

A: Of block nine.  

Q: Okay. So she only become s involved with the camp office -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
65 
 
A: In -- in -- after October -- e-end of September. 
Q: Okay, and you come  in and -- 

A: ™42. 

Q: Right. 

A: I come  out of the selection. 

Q: Right. 

A: I™m helping to establish the -- the camp office -- 

Q: Okay. 

A: -- by designing the card -- cardex for different
 purposes. We had an cardex system for the 
living, an cardex system for the dead, an cardex sy
stem for the -- for the work details. Then there 
were ma ny functions in that -- in the camp o
ffice, like again, the principle bookkeeping. People 
were engaged by collecting daily 
dartas of nationalitie
s so that they coul
d supply me  for my 
diagram, and for the statistics which I had to --
 of whi-- of which I have been engaged on an 
daily basis. There were ma ny functions and ma ny 
employees in that office, but I could start -- I 
mean, we had to -- I establishe
d the individual barrack books whic
h each blockelteste -- I think 
Mrs. -- what™s her name? S -- Sheila Romi ano 
[indecipherable]. We ll, you 
interviewed Palarchik. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: She ma de an enormous mi stake when she said
 they were keeping a 
book for nationalities, a 
book for professionals, a book for -- by number, and a book by name s. Now, as I have been in 

charge of putting the columns, and making the co
lumns in those books, because they were blank 

sheets in the book, I don™t reme mber  ever to ha ve  supplied four books to each barrack. 

Q: Each barrack. 

A: Huh?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
66 
 
Q: You had one book? 
A: It was one book, where we had the columns, yeah. Now -- and because of that, I enga ge 

some ti me s, people to help, and to draw those colu
mns, and to ma rk the different columns. Peop -

- ma inly people who were discharged from hospita
l and needed time to recuperate, and then time  
to be transferred to a m -- kind of an good job. 
So that -- there were so ma ny people who went 
through that drawing office, just in
 the stage of recup -- of re --
 to recuperate, yeah. So it was 
quite -- very satisfying. Among others, what™s he
r name , Sus a n was working there with us, too, 
while she wa s just out of hospital. That how
 we me t, actually, in Birkenau. Okay?  Now you 
know, Susan Chernakshpatz. 

Q: Right, right. But -- but sh
e didn™t write very well. 
A: Huh?  

Q: She did -- her handwr
iting was terrible, right? 
A: Horrible. To -- her handwriting 
is now the one of an real ol
d person. Have any of you noticed 
that? 

Q: No, I said her handwriting 
then, I thought, was terrible. 
A: No, no, no.  

Q: No?  

A: She was just drawing lines. 

Q: Oh, I see. 

A: Yeah. No, I wouldn™t let -- no, who learned ve
ry nicely, and who did quite an good job, was 
Magba Helinger. 

Q: Really? 

A: Yeah.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462

Q: So if I would ask -- what you™ve expl
ained to me  is that
 Mandel is the top. 
A: Ah, you mean -- 
Q: Drexel is next. 

A: Ah, you want to have an -- an o-organizational chart? 

Q: I have one, but I don™t know
 that it holds everything. 
A: But Mandel, and -- you see it™s -- those jobs
 have changed, and some times people were on the 
same level. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: We ll anyhow, what would you like to know
? You have on top, in the camp, always the 
ober h afsi er ens. 

Q: Right. 

A: The top -- top SS person, where they had pos
itions and rank, so you must always use both. 
With SS ma n is the same. If some body was an  -- 
an rapport fuhrer, that 
was his position, but his 
rank was an military one, yeah. So that 
is always to be take n in account, too. 

Q: So what was Mandel? 

A: His rank. The military rank. 

Q: No, no, no. What is -- what was Mandel™s position and rank? 

A: She was no soldier. 

Q: Right. 

A: She was ober -- amongst the women, the personnel,
 there were only -- they only had one title. 
Q: They only had a position. 

A: She was oberhavsiehiden. 

Q: Right, okay. And Drexel? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
68 
 
A: Once -- she was, among others, oberhafsieren 
too, but before that, sh
e was rapport fuhrering. 
Q: And wha t  is her relationship, organizat
ionally, to Mandel?  Is she under Mandel? 
A: There was a time when they were on the same  
level, yeah. There were time s when they were 
on the same  level. 
Q: By the way, did you know the woma n who wa
s there before Mandel?  A lat -- Lang? 
A: What? Yeah. 

Q: There was a wo ma n who was in th
at position before Mandel came in. 
A: Yeah, but she was before 
-- she -- she was Langerfelt. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Yeah. Actually died in between. 

Q: She died? 

A: Yeah. She was a good woma n. 

Q: She was? Cause you know, in that Au
schwitz book that the museum publi -- 
A: [indecipherable] 
Q: That the museum published. 

A: No. 

Q: Yeah, you do know. The one that -- that wa
s published -- you know, the book that -- that was 
the edited book about Auschwitz that came out a 
few years ago. There™s a -- there™s a couple of 
articles about the women™s camp, and they desc
ribe her as being particularly brutal and 
disorganized, and the SS sent
 her away. That™s not so? 
A: Who described her? 

Q: I™ll show you. 

A: Yeah, but who described her, any specific person? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
69 
 
Q: No, the article does. I don™t know wh
ere they got the information from. 
A: No, she was not. 
Q: Okay. So underneath 
the oberhafsieren -- 
A: But it depends on -- wait a mi nute. 

Q: What? 

A: You see, you must realize that there were times
 that that -- the pictur
e has changed constantly, 
yeah? 

Q: Right. I™m not sugge -- 

A: Picture has changed, and I™d -- could -- whil
e Mandel was oberhafsieren be-between then and 

then, yeah, you must realize that -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- you have to bring those pe
ople how -- how the camp has developed, and that you will find -
- I would not make now, or waste my time or yours,
 but they are working in Auschwitz now with 
a researching the development of the women™s camp, and they will have the datas much -- very 

well defined, very soon. 

Q: Oh good. 

A: Then we can use that. Then we™ll be able to use that. 

Q: Okay. 

A: Partially, yeah. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: Ah, the ranutachek is not very reliable, because she can only report on things which are f -- 

Q: Were reported to her. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
70 
 
A: What -- reported to her, or 
what people have -- testimonies, 
and testimonies are some ti me s so 
bad, I -- I™m have certain testimonies from Auschw
itz that I would never use, yeah. Brrr, what 
else? 
Q: Alright, but let me  ask you this. The camp offi ce 
that -- if there are th
ree off -- at one point 
there are three off -- there™s 
the camp office, there™s the work detail [indecipherabl e] 

A: Al-All in -- all in one -- in one -- we 
had one barrack, and that was block four. 
Q: Right. I understand that. 

A: B -- B2 -- B1B in block four. 

Q: Right. 

A: Most of the time. In the beginning, in Birk
enau, it was in the -- in B1A. B1A on barrack I 
think 12, I have to check that, because from th
ere I have been hospitalized, and there I had 
typhus, and there I lost my mi nd. 
But the real camp office, in 
function, was afte
r our relocation 
from B1A to B1B, and established in the -- in bloc
k four, where half of the block wa -- the camp 
wa -- were offices, and the 
other half were quarters. 
Q: Quarters. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Quarters, okay. 

A: And in the front, where all the offices were, all the offices, the work detail office, and the ca-

camp office, and the drawing office. 

Q: Work service? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: And where was the work service office? 

A: Huh?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
71 
 
Q: The work service office? 
A: W- Work detail -- work 
detail office, not work -- 
Q: We ll wait a mi nute, but when you spoke to me  before -- 

A: Ah yeah, [indecipherable] no, no -- 

Q: But you distinguished between ar
bide zychen, and arbides deenst. 
A:  Deenst  yeah, but  t he arbi de
s deenst  had onl y one -- one f-fe ma
l e  empl oyee, and she had her 

office outside where the SS blockfuhresterwer wa s. 
No, they -- they were combined. The block -- 

it was the arbides einsatz who had ma ny, many 
employees, and who had an cardex system. The 
arbides deenst had only one thing 
to do to ma ke available the -- th
e amount of people, but the -- 
to make available the people -- 

Q: Was the ar -- was the work service. 

A: -- by -- by dema nd of -- 

Q: Right. 
A: -- qualifications, were the work detail office. 
They had to collect constantly the people from 
different barracks, because they knew where they 
are, we had the cardex
 system established.  
Q: Now wai t  a mi nute. Now, I™ m confused. Wha t
 is arbides deenst mean? Is that the works 
detail?  
A: The service -- service. 

Q: That™s service? 

A: They ma de available the amount by asking the 
work detail office t-to get the people, yeah. 
Q: And so the work detail is arbi des zychen? 

A: Arbides einsatz.  

Q: Arbide -- so -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
72 
 
A: And the arbides deenst, I would not even mention, because that was not a function, it was 
only one person who had ma ny, ma ny things --
 was numerous and coordinator between the 
employer and the employee. 

Q: No, you got -- you got to go back, because -- 

A: Oy. 

Q: -- you -- you keep change -- either you keep ch
anging the words, or I™m not hearing it right. 
A: Look, it™s -- with ma  -- me  it™s hard, because
 you v -- I -- to translate from Ger man into 

English, it doesn™t ma ke some ti me s sense. 

Q: I understand, but -- 

A: No, no. 

Q: -- from a long time ago -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- you called the work detail -- 
A: Arbides einsatz. 
Q: No. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Didn™t. You didn™t do it then. You
™re saying now it™s ar
 -- it™s arbide -- 
A: Einsatz. 

Q: Einsatz. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: And that™s only one person. 

A: No. 

Q: See, that -- this is
 where it™s confusing. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
73 
 
A: No. 
Q: Because what you originally told me  --  

A: No. 

Q: -- was that the work detail was where the cardex of all the skills. 

A: Correct. 

Q: So that™s work detail. 

A: Work detail. 

Q: But the work service was where they -- 

A: One person. And actually, the li -- liaison 
between employer, and -- and employe es. That 
means the companies or individuals who request
ed the service, went 
through the one person. 
Q: That person in the work service. 

A: Work service, they say -- 

Q: So they would say I need 50 road workers. 
A: So the work service went to 
the arbides einsatz, and said sele
ct al -- your specialists of your 
people who can do or perform the job, yeah. Because she had no -- you see, the work service had 
the request for 50 people who can do road work, okay? 

Q: Right, right.  

A: She went to the work detail office. 

Q: To say who can do it. 

A: And ask, get me  50 people. The work detail o
ffice went to the indi vidual barracks, because 
they had in their cardex the road workers, good ro
ad workers. Where are they?  They™re there, in 
there. And had contact -- ma de contact with the bl
ockelteste, and ask them to send so and so, and 
so and so, and so and so next mo
rning, until they had the 50 together. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
74 
 
Q: Okay. 
A: But the work service did other things, too, whic
h is not really defined. She ma de all kinds of 
jobs, she ma de all kinds of other things, yea
h. After all, you had to do a job for -- for hundred 
and thousand of inma tes to -- to administer on 
every possible level, lik
e food and -- and clothing, 
and -- and in -- it was -- it™s 
co -- a complicated business -- 

Q: Well, it™s -- yeah. 

A: -- but if it come s -- now, let™s forget about 
the logistic, let™s do the 
work of -- of how to 

supply the work force to the employers, yeah, 
who are requested. [indecipherable] requested. 
Q: All right, so they request 10 people. 

A: They request. 

Q: They go to the work service and say, ﬁI need 10 people.ﬂ The work -- 

A: Ah, no, it could have happened that they went to
 the work -- they went to the head -- work 
service got the order, yeah, 10 peopl
e tomorrow morning, in from dobseldor. 
Q: Okay. 

A: She ma de sure that the right people were select
ed out of the cardex, andout of the availability 
of surplus. 

Q: So, it would move -- the request goes to the work service. She ma de -- 
I™m just talking about 

this one piece of it. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Okay? She will then go to the work detail where the cardex exists. Let™s say they need 10 

tailors. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: They need some thing very specific. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
75 
 
A: Correct, correct. 
Q: So they will look through the cardex -- 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: -- find 10, say here are the name s, or do they -- 

A: No, no. 

Q: -- they say we will -- 

A: No, she -- she will go and ask for 10 tailors. 

Q: Right. 

A: When do you need them?  Tomorrow morning. 
They went to the different barracks -- 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- selected -- got the 10 tailor
s, according to their cardex a
nd name s and numbers, and have 
asked the blockelteste to bring 
those 10 tailors tomorrow morning in
 front of the camp  office, or 
wherever [indecipherable] 
Q: Right. Now, would the peopl
e in the work detail -- 
A: Wait a minute, then -- 
Q: Oh okay, all right. 

A: -- the 10 people, marching out
 the door to their destiny, wh
ich they received by the work 
service person, yeah. The work detail did onl
y the admi nistrative j
ob. The work service 
physically delivered the people. 

Q: Okay. And there was a specific place that the 
was -- that these 10 people were told to go? 
A: Yeah. And [indecipherable] door, and -- 

Q: [i ndecipherable] and wait ther e until the person fr om the work service came and said, this is 

your -- this is where you™re going. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
76 
 
A: Correct. Because she requested it, and she got it, yeah. 
Q: Right, okay. Now, when the wo
rk detail looks in the cards. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Do they have to go through Katya before they 
go to the head of the -- to the blockelteste or 
not?  

A: Of course, they had to go through our carde
x, and either to transf
er the people to other 
barracks, to other pl aces, to other sub- camps, yeah. 

Q: Right, because you have to be able to -- to -- 

A: They had to be delivered to the -- to the -- th
ey had to be ma de available to the people who re-
requested the services, yeah. Now, that could have 
been on transfer to another camp, or just to be 
available every morning, through the 
blockelteste, ma ke her responsib
le that those people will be 
ready every morning, until they are going to can -- 
be cancelled, or until they die. And that was 
one of the responsibilities of some  
blockelteste too, that if they had 
to be -- if they were selected 
for an particular job, an -- or an
 -- a steady job, to be there, ye
ah. Once they have been told to 
supply those 10 people every day, they had to stick 
to the request. There was a b -- v -- from the 
mome nt a blockelteste wa s involved w
ith Katya, our office was involved, too. 
Q: [inaudible] Hm. Oka y. 

A: It™s ve ry hard to -- it was -- 
those situations have changed consta
ntly. But the --  it is true that  -
- but if you were an real profe
ssional, and there were certain 
work details -- constant work 
details, that -- that the -- that 
was an routine -- it became routine,
 yeah. Of certain work details 
had an certain number, yeah. So they were regist
ered as a work detail under that -- in that 
number. 10 people, and someti mes only eight could 
come, because two were sick, so she had to 

engage again two more. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
77 
 
Q: Two mor e , right. 
A: Through the same  process, yeah. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: Look, it was not simple. 

Q: Right. No, I understand that. 

A: Yeah. It was not simple, and each -- really, it
™s hard to believe that
 in an group of so ma ny 
people with different situations, 
and different backgrounds, that we 
had manage -- that we have 
ma naged to bring law and order into the place. A
nd there were times then, that we have ma naged 
to -- to supply everybody with 
his ration. Those time s were gone
 that we were comi ng home  
from an outdoor work and the blockelteste to
ld you, ﬁ We have no more food for you.ﬂ Yeah. 
That never occurred under Katya. Rations were
 supplied, we had -- or 
they arranged special 
rations. Katya really ma de what she could in 
the time of counting the work -- the -- time of 
counting the -- during the roll call time was cut 
down to an s -- mi nimu m amount of t i me , yeah, 
and that meant more relaxation, more sleep. 

Q: I was going to get into this, but go ahead. Go ah -- 

A: What? 

Q: -- go, continue. 

A: Yeah, that is all what I™m trying to say, th
at it was not so simple how people think, and to 

ma nage an -- and t-to manage the food distri
bution, the clothing distribution, the bedding, you 
name  it, all s -- s -- clothing ides, including shoe
s. That is -- was not -- was -- became  a l ways, 
during those years or th-those months , improve
d, improved enormously, yeah. Then we had 
enormous [i ndecipherable] blacks of Hungarian Jews
 in the four -- mi ddle of ™44, and so on. That 
was an big problem, yeah, but as they were sep --
 as those newcomers there, there was a lot of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
78 
 
move me nt. Newcomers were comi ng, and old-come rs 
were sent on transport, because they were 
requested in factories in Germ
any. A lot of people had been 
requested, but also a lot of 
move me nt, and we had to account for each person, and the roll calls again became  mo re 
complicated, but the system i mprove d by sticking to
 it well, and -- and selecting more intelligent 
blockelteste, and block admi nist
rators, so it was always the tendency of improveme nt , and of 
[indecipherable] re -- raising thestandard of living [indecipherable] 

Q: In spite of -- in spite of th
e fact that you™re in a situation 
that is meant for people to die? 
A: Right. We had to carry on. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And we did not believe for one mome nt to gi
ve up, yeah. Never. That was an ama -- that I 
have learned to survive. Even now, I can be half
 dead, and if I have a 
-- an job to do, I™m doing 
it. But we -- we were carrying on, not know
ing if you are going to live tomorrow, yeah. 
Q: Sippy, can you list the functions 
that the works -- th 
-- I understand that wo
rk detail only took 
down the cardex of information. But the work se
rvice seems to be more complicated, and the 
camp office has ma ny more
 different functions. 
A: Oh yeah. 

Q: The camp office seemed to -- is the largest -- 

A: Right. 

Q: -- and the much more com -- 

A: Correct. 

Q: -- complex of all three, right? 

A: We  had to di -- we had to control the punishme
nt detail. We had to control the supply of not 
only -- it was not enough to ask for people, and 
to supply the people for work, but it was an 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
79 
 
question of, as I said, food rations, clothing, bedd
ing, hygiene, cleaning of the barracks, cleaning 
of each bed, a -- delousing, de -- and we had to -- 
we had to work very clos ely with the work 
detail people. The work service had very little 
to do with the rest of those functions. They only 
have supplied upon the request, those people they 
have -- that was an request for people, and 
they had to supply, and nobody coul
d care less how we did it, yeah. 
Q: Right. 
A: Or how they did it. 

Q: Right, right. Is Canada , the hos
pi tal sauna, also under the camp office? 
A: Canada is an work detail, had --
 the camp offi ce -- not the camp office. 
Q: Not? 

A: Or the work detail office, had any 
influence on any -- on any work detail.  
Q: So Canada had nothing to do with the camp office? 

A: Wa it a minute. Canada was one of ma ny. 
Q: Right. 
A: Are you talking about the Canada camp?  

Q: Yeah. 

A: Ca mp, or the work detail? 

Q: No, no, no. No, the work detail. 

A: Work detail. One work detail  m- more or 
less. Why Cana da?  Why have you selected Canada? 
Q: No, no, no, I™m just asking, are there -- 

A: Th -- nothing special, they were just anothe
r work detail. They had their -- now, in those 
different work details, you had an structur
e. You had the oberkapo, under -- underkapo, for-

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
80 
 
fore me n, and all kinds of functions. So Canada was just one of a work -- but just one among 
ma ny work details. 

Q: All right, so, but then, what I™m trying -- what
 I™m trying to do is figure out what -- what is 
the function of the camp office?   

A: Oh. 

Q: It™s to oversee all of the wo
rk -- no. You explain it, I™m not 
there, you™re ex -- you explain it 
to me . If you have to say to some one who 
doesn™t know anything, what is the camp office 
supposed to be doing?  They have a nu
mber of different functions, right? 
A: Now, can you imagine that you have s -- hundreds of barracks, correct? 

Q: Right. 

A: You have, first of all, the camp office had to
 admi nister all sub-camps, and branch camps, 
yeah. We ™re that start. 

Q: All sub-camps and br anch camps, okay. Let™s -- let™s --  
A: So ther -- 
Q: -- let me -- let me turn the tape. 

A: Yeah. 
End of Tape Three, Side A 
Beginning Ta pe Three, Si de B 
Q: This is tape number three, 
side -- tape number three, si
de B, United States Holocaust 
Memorial Museum interview with Helen 
Tichauer on September seventh, 2000. Okay. 
A: Now, let™s start with the ma in procedur
e. The very most important function in all 
concentration camps, were the da ily roll call. Once
 or twice. Now, to have individual branch 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
81 
 
camps, individual sub-camps, or what -- service ca
mps, or whatever I am calling that, had to be 
roll called every day, okay? 
Q: Right. 

A: To do that, you had to report every day, once or 
twice, and every day on
ce or twice, hours and 
hours were spent on the roll call. Now, if the come
 -- if the people were, during the roll call time, 
in the camp, or working outdoors, or working outsi
de, it ma de no difference. The amount of the 
people had to coincide with the estimated amount
 which was set every day. We  had -- that was 
an very complicated and important, quote unquote, th
ing. Only [indecipherable] to be busy, or to 
be engaged was already a -- a -- 
a big job, the roll call. Hours 
and hours [indecipherable] you had 
to prepare the food intake and distribution, wh
ich -- I mean, the distribution was done by the 
individual blockelteste, but you had to order it
, you had to request it, every day. How could you 
do that?  According to the roll call. The roll call 
-- you had -- for the roll 
call incomi ng transports, 
outgoing transports, transfers from 
hospital, to the -- to the camp, 
from the camp to the hospital. 
The dying, the corpse, the gassing. It 
was an constant report on check control and check control, 
yeah. You had only the relationship between th
e hospital compound, and th
e releases, and the 
requests for transfers from the camp to the hospi
tal, from the hospital to the camp. There were 
functions which involved with the cardex sy
stem. People were dying, out of the living cardex, 
into the dead cardex. There were reports to be
 written daily, on certain thing which they 
requested by headquarters. I had -- I myself ha
d an lot of work to do, which I cannot explain 
right now. You had the interaction between the work detail office, and the camp offi ce, due to 

those movements, they are already an full time 
job, yeah. And it had to be exact, and n -- we 
couldn™t -- you could not afford to have one pers
on mi slaid or  mi splaced, yeah. So that was an 
very, very ups -- painstaking, or 
how do you call that?  Painstaking?   

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
82 
 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: Event, and we were always concerned about
 one thing. God forbid some -- the figures don™t 
coincide. That means the whole night to stand unt
il the fi gures -- until the --
 the figures are right. 
Q: Right. 

A: So that was not our fault, it -- the SS, the id
iotic system, to build the whole, everything on that 
roll call business was taking -- was keeping us 
busy for hours and hours and hours, daily. What 
can I tell you? 

Q: Why do you th -- why do you think so ma ny 
survivors, who were in Auschwitz -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- do not reme mber, or do not know that there 
was a difference between roll calls at one time  

or another. All of them seem
 to talk about long roll calls. 
A: Wa it a minute. I don™t understa
nd your question. Why do I se -- 
Q: Most -- most -- most aus -- Auschwitz survivors -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- who were ordinary prisoners, when they talk 
about roll call, they neve
r talk about short roll 
calls. They only talk about long 
roll calls. Why do you -- why do you think that that™s so, when 
what you have is a very clear me mor y that 
the roll calls got shor
ter as time  went on. 
A: Of course. 

Q: Not longer. 

A: Because we improved that. 

Q: But why do you think -- do -- do you think that they™re -- 

A: Because they have no me mory, and they cannot 
distinguish the time  -- span of time. But we 
had our -- our stopwatch, yeah.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
83 
 
Q: Right. 
A: And we were counting [indeciph
erable] working with a stopwatch, to -- to eliminate, and to 
improve the roll call. 

Q: Can you explain how you improved it? 

A: Of course. 

Q: I know you™ve explained it to 
me  before, but do it again. 
A: By being more efficient, by -- by preparing the ro
ll calls in an -- with an special system of -- 
of pre -- pre-roll call --
 pr e-roll call report.  
Q: Right. 

A: You -- we knew at evening, preparing the whol
e business that in the morning, barrack so and 
so, after the transfers 
were ma de from the barrack to 
the hospital compound, and from the 
barrack to an transport waiting at the railway sta
tion, and from that barrack on transfer to I don™t 
know where, and the same  barrack receivi ng so a
nd so many from the hospital, and receivi ng so 
and so many newcomers, must be 24, yeah?  And 
in the morning, those 24 report -- were reported 
by preparing that the whole evening, yeah. So we 
have, before the roll call in the mor ning, every 
-- it was an system we established, every block 
admi nistrator reported an hour earlier, we will 
have 24 people on our barrack, yeah? 

Q: Right. 

A: So when the roll call people were comi ng to 
count, they knew there must be 24. They were 
not counting how ma ny were there,
 but there had to be 24. That -- we have called that an 
forappelle. [i ndecipherable] the appe lle, yeah. 

Q: So they were simply verifying what the report said. 

A: Pardon?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
84 
 
Q: They were verifying what the report said. 
A: What report? 

Q: The -- the pre-report. The pre -- 

A: The pre-report, they were very
 find what the pre-report said.  
Q: What -- as opposed 
to just counting? 
A: And there was nobody mi ssing. Couldn™t. 

Q: Right. 

A: So that already had eliminated the unnecessary forward and backwards, and shifting and 

running, and -- and guessing, yeah. We had everythi
ng prepared every evening. It was an full 
time job of an whole staff. 

Q: Right. 

A: Including the -- the -- it™s 
so people don™t have the slightest idea what we nt on.    
Q: Bef-Before you would do these reports -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- what were they count -- I mean, i-
if they di dn™t --  
it™s interesting. 
A: Th-They didn™t know what they are doing. 

Q: If they didn™t know -- they di -- th
ey didn™t know what they were doing. 
A: No. 

Q: So how -- what were they counting for?  Th
ey were simply counting, and -- but they didn™t 
know what they were getting. 

A: Correct. And if that was Katy
a who introduced all the whole sy
stem, we once went on with an 
stopwatch, and discovered that the highlights 
of one counting, took only three mi nutes. You 
know how ma ny lives they save?  How ma ny pe ople c
ould relax instead to suffer in the snow, in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
85 
 
the heat?  Now whatever the survivors are tel
ling you, they have no idea. I™m telling you, they 
have no idea, our researchers have no idea. 
As I said, Yergen never entered an Germa n 
concentration camp. Is he an expert now on con
centration camp?  Had -- what™s her name , of the 
woma n Ner hamatek writes books now on concentration camp, has no ideas what™s an 

concentration camp is. So you cannot always rely 
on the which -- on -- on the so-called experts, 

yeah. 

Q: Right. 

A: You have to go deeper, and ask them to -- 
to look in -- to do what
 you are doing right now. 
It™s not easy to work with you. It™s not easyto answer your questi
ons, don™t you think so? 
Q: I don™t know.  

A: [indecipherable] 

Q: Only you can judge that. 

A: But I don™t know if -- if you understand what I am saying. 
Q: No, I think I do understand what you are saying. 
A: Good. 

Q: And the effect on the SS, they were -- th
ey were glad not to
 be outside either. 
A: They were glad to go home , to be able to
 go home , yeah. There was less beating, and less -- 
less -- less of everything, yeah. 

Q: Now, I reme mber when we were discussing th
is when Irwin was alive. And he described the 
men™s camp as creating chaos. 

A: How?  

Q: And the wome n™s camp as creating organiza
tion, and that it was a very different way. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
86 
 
A: Okay, but it was not always, yeah?  They couldn™
t afford to do that always, becaus e eventually 
they got tired of it, yeah. And the people [indeciphe
rable] they created that was just  for awhile, 
while they were newcomers, and th
ey were new -- numerologists, yeah? 
Q: Yeah, yeah. 
A: And I don™t know what. But that was not an consta
nt habit. They couldn™t afford to do that all 
the time . 

Q: All the time. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: But that was something that they wanted to 
do, and that was not what the wome n wanted to 
do. 

A: Ha -- the wome n, they were [indecipherable]. 
The wome n were just happy to go to bed, to go 
to sleep. That was never on our mi nd to -- to 
ma ke things complicated during that time. You 
don™t know how hard it was for us. We were still 
-- no. Why the ma n did it, they were -- ma n is a 
religious ma n. They were crazy, yeah. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: They were not allowed to count. You know J e ws -- 

Q: Yeah. 

A: -- are not allowed to be counted -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- and things like that. It was not an very 
heroic act whats is com -- what they committed 

there. But after awhile  that disappeared, that di
sappeared. We  had all kinds of situations. In the 
beginning, everybody wanted to together
 with her sisters, her mother with her, cousins. But then 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
87 
 
they have learned that -- that th
e appelle is not an social gath
ering, yeah. Have learned it very 
quickly. Anything else
, please? Carry on. 
Q: Okay. 

A: [indecipherable] 

Q: You once said to me  that the SS did not
 have any control over the camp office. 
A: No. 

Q: It didn™t? 

A: No. 

Q: You guys ruled the roos
t, you created the rules? 
A: Huh?  

Q: You guys created the rules?  How -- how could 
it be that they didn™t 
have control over you? 
A: Because they had nobody who understood. 

Q: What you were doing? 
A: Yeah. 
Q: So you created this -- 
not even Mandel understood? 
A: Huh?  

Q: Not -- Mandel didn™t unde
rstand what you were doing? 
A: Not really. 

Q: And whe n -- 

A: She just wanted results, yeah. They couldn™t 
care less what we are doing, as long as they got 
what they needed. So results, as long as Ma
ndel had from me, at the end of each month, a 
beautiful ma de diagram with 18 or 20 different curv
es, which went to -- over to -- to Berlin, she 
couldn™t care less when I did that
, how I did that, why I did it. 
She once caught me  in the mi ddle 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
88 
 
of the after -- of an afternoon in
 bed, while ma king an surprise vi
sit to the barrac
k, and I was in 
bed, yeah. But I was known -- ﬁWh- why are you here
? ﬂ  I said, ﬁI have cramps.ﬂ So s he said, 
ﬁCarry on, sleep, and get better.ﬂ Yeah. But sh
e knew very well that I did my job, and I 
[indecipherable] what -- what I™m -- what they 
wanted from me . And they have known me  very 
well that I have worked during the night all the ti
me, yeah. Because I wanted to have the day for 
myself, to visit and so on, yea
h, all the running around so that -- that what™s his name , Garovitch 
called me , I was a runner, he thought I 
was a runner, okay?  You reme mbe r-- 
Q: Yeah, yeah. 
A: -- on the tapes. 

Q: Yeah, yeah. 

A: Okay.  

Q: But you didn™t sleep s -- you di
dn™t sleep very
 much, then? 
A: No. 
Q: How ma ny hours did you get, you think? 
A: I slept some ti me s during the day. I engaged 
someti mes an -- the guar
d, which watched the 
door, and I said I™m going to sleep, call me  if some body is in the vicinity, so I could sleep nearly 

every day. 

Q: So did you get four hours, five hours? 

A: I mi  -- more. 

Q: More?  

A: I -- I had my -- I slept, but I worked at ni
ght, and nobody knew when I slept, but as I said, 
they watched out for me , I -- I had 
the -- I slept that -- during the da
y a little bit, and then I was 
running a little bit. At night I was working, 
so nobody disturbed, yeah. And some ti mes the SS 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
89 
 
was comi ng in at -- to those who were in charge, 
at night, cause there wa
s lights in the barrack. 
So they just got -- got used to 
it that I™m working at night. 
Q: And wha t  did you do during the day when you 
were running around, you were seeing people? 
A: Visiting my fr iends. 
Q: How could you be the -- weren™t the peopl
e on work details?  We ren™t there do -- 
A: Yeah, but   those who were 
some  blockelteste, some  block ad
mi nistrators, nice people, yeah. 
Q: So what did you talk about? 

A: Huh?  

Q: What did you talk about? 

A: Everything. Just like anybody else. 

Q: What do you mean? 

A: We  were talking about anything. 

Q: Did you talk about what was going on? 
A: Yeah, and got reports from newcomers. 
Q: About the war, and where -- 

A: What they were telling us, and w-we were just
 talking about it, and all kinds of things. Then 
they had news from their boyfriends, and al
so outside world, and all kinds of things. 
Q: Did you feel you were in sort of an Ali
ce in Wonderland world, that it was really -- 
A: Huh?  

Q: -- it sounds very strange, Sippy. 

A: What? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
90 
 
Q: All of it sounds very strange, b
ecause it™s a very -- it™s -- it™s 
a fascinating combination of the 
completely macabre and awful, and the ordinar
y. Do you know what I me an?  I mean sor -- a sort 
of ordinary life is happening in the 
mi dst of the most extraordinarily -- 
A: Yeah, but you must realize I have -- I myself
 had -- was -- had an creative job, yeah. I was 
very creative. On the other ha
nd, I was building even one mode
l of the camp, I told you that. 
Q: Right. 
A: And then [indecipherable] creativity was th
erapeutic, I worked in the orchestra, yeah. 
Q: Right. 

A: So that was my -- my luck, that I could be -- 
that I could disengage my self from -- from the he 
-- from hell, yeah.  

Q: But part of your work you couldn™t possibl
y disengage yourself fr
om the hell, right? 
A: Yeah, but for -- some times from - -  for hours, it was good enough. 

Q: Uh-huh. 
A: Then you were back again. 
Q: Right. And you never got depressed? 

A: No. 

Q: Never?  

A: No. Just like now, I™m not getting depressed. 

Q: Did you get angry? 

A: No. No, I -- I -- I have a -- 

Q: Did you not have feelings? 

A: Listen, I have an heart, and -- 

Q: I know that. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
91 
 
A: -- I had to protect my  heart. If
 I have the feeling of in an state of beginning to be angry, I -- 
I™ve had to stop myself, and to te
ll myself, don™t get angry, don™t ge
t excited, save your heart. I 
want to live, I -- you see, I -- if
 I would get excited and angry o-
over everything, I could have -- I 
could have a heart attack, and I 
want to avoid that. I was not -- 
never angry. I™m avoiding anger, 
I™m avoiding fights. I -- do you know -- do you know anybody with whom I am fighting? 
Q: No. 

A:  That ™s -- 

Q: And you were -- and you were like 
this when you were in your 20™s? 
A: Huh?  

Q: You were like this when you were in your 
20™s, in Auschwitz?  You did the same  thing, you 
backed off of -- so you tried to ma intain a level emotional field, yeah? 

A: Mm. 

Q: Did you cry?  No. It™s rather amazing, you know.  
A: What can I tell you? 
Q: Does that surprise you when you think about it? 

A: No. 

Q: No. 

A: No. I th -- I am grateful that I am able to do it. 

Q: You think it helped you survive? 

A: Hm?  

Q: You think it helped you survive? 

A: It helps me  to survive now. 

Q: Now. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
92 
 
A: Yeah. If I would -- if I would be angry over 
everything what is goi
ng on, yeah, I could -- I 
couldn™t -- I could -- could not liv
e. There were -- that Ben Mea
d, for example, just to watch 
what he is doing, and what he did all those year
s, and what really nobody hears, yeah. And is on 
top of everything, yeah.  
Q: But that does ma ke y
ou angry in some  ways. 
A: It makes me angry because I have approached him so many times. 

Q: Right. 

A: That I would like to be engaged in
 some thing, yeah. That ma kes me  a ngry. 
Q: Yeah. But you hold -- you hold back the anger. 

A: I hold back the anger. 

Q: See now? 

A: And then I see Madonja. The mo me nt I star
t to hold back the anger, I see Madonja, think 
about some thing else. Yeah, what are we going to do now? 
Q: Wa nt to take a break? 
A: What™s the time now, three? 

Q: The time is 25 of four. 

A: Yeah, I don™t need a br
eak, I can carry on. You -- 
Q: Do you want some  more water? 

A: Not -- no, I had enough. 

Q: Well, let me ask you a 
few more questions-- 
A: No. 

Q: -- and then I think I may need to take a break. 

A: Are you tired? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
93 
 
Q: Not so much, not so much. 
A: Look, am I ma king you tired? 

Q: No, no, no, you don™t ma ke me  tired. You don™t ma ke me  tired. 

A: Good. 

Q: Sippy, you sa -- you -- you me ntioned the fact th
at one day when Mandel walked in, you were 
taking a nap, and you told her you had cramps. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: So that meant you were me nstruating? 

A: Huh?  

Q: That me a nt you were
 getting your period? 
A: I had -- I had menst -- menstrual pains. 

Q: Menstrual pa -- did you get your period
?  You did. But not for the first 14 months? 
A: 14 months.  
Q: So how do you -- to what do you attri
bute the change?  Do you have any idea? 
A: Yeah. I started to eat differen
tly, yeah. I had mi xed my c a mp f
ood wi th an little bit of self-
cooked food. 
Q: And whe r e did you get that food from?  

A: I had a girlfriend with whom I worked toge
ther, and all she did, she -- we had our bread 
rations in -- divided into one part 
to eat, and one part to exchange for potatoes, that™s all. And the 
potatoes we have mi xed an little 
bit with ma rgarine, which we obt
ained. So we were eat -- the 
feeling that you can eat -- that 
you are eating a little bit differen
tly, yeah, contributed to your 
well-being. It was nothing special. Then we had 
parcels received. I -- I ha
d two rations from the 
special rations from the orchestra, and the cam
p office. And there were fruits and there were 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
94 
 
other goodies, yeah. Those special rations, specia
l parcels which people were receivi ng from the 
parcel section, from the pack -- package room, 
because there were all good things, they brang 
things which we did not had before, in the begi
nning. So I had that. Then this -- we have 
received from Switzerland, the Sl
ovakian girls, there was by some
 of the organizations, of the 
Czech organi zations, they paid through -- in 
Switzerland they purchased sa rdines, ye ah. We  
received those sardines, we received some
 chocolate from ti me to time , yeah. 
Q: The Jewish girls could get these? 
A: Yeah. Th -- there is even a description of 
the organization who sponsored that. They had to 
pay for each person who was deported. They had to supply and buy, even if they were alive or  no 

-- if they were di -- regardless 
if they are alive or  not. The SS 
collected all the dead people™s 
parcels, but those who were alive 
were -- rece ived the parcels. So 
every -- every little bit added 
to -- to the body™s re-recover
y, yeah. And that was among [indecipherable] reason, but you know 
I even me nstruated when we went on the Death March, with heavy cramps. 
Q: So when you were in the camp office, how 
did you take care of the period physically?  Did 
they -- did they have -- 
A: Yeah, the -- 

Q: -- certai n -- 

A: -- the package -- not package, but 
clothing barrack, yeah, had -- not -- 
Q: Napkins? 

A: Napkins. 

Q: Fe mi nine napkins. They did? 

A: I obtained some  napkins from them, not offi
cially, but I obtained 
some. [indecipherable] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
95 
 
Q: And did other wome n in the camp office also 
get their period, or was it -- did it vary?  Did you 
know?  
A: You know what? 

Q: You didn™t know? 

A: I don™t know. 

Q: You don™t know. 

A: Not really, no. 

Q: That™s interesting. 

A: Uh?  

Q: That™s interesting, because there™s su
ch a -- a -- so ma ny wome n mention -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- that they didn™t get their period. 

A: For the first 14 months, nothing. 
Q: Nothing. 
A: Yeah, but then when things became a little bit 
easier and better --  emotionally it was an very 
lifting -- mo rally, I mean, it was an very important 
thing to know that -- th
at you have a little bit 
of an better food intake than you had before. In 
the beginning, I mean, I had all kinds of up -- I 
was so sick. There is no ailment I did not we
nt through without me dical treatment. And I 
survived, and then with bette
r food, you [indecipherable] hoping -- do you know that my friends 
from Bratislava, from my city -- a gir -- I had a 
girlfriend who was half Jewish. She was at home , 
and when I have learned that the German post o
ffice is functioning vair, and parcels are arriving 
to non-Jewish prisoners from their home in Ger m
any, I made it my business to write a letter, 

because we were able to write from time to time 
cards, post cards. I wrot e to one of my friends 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
96 
 
who was half Jewish and half Germa n, to send me
 -- to -- oh no, not to send 
me , but to greet -- to 
send my gre e tings to two people. They were not
 people, but they were
 -- one was an butcher 
shop, with the delicatessen shop, and the other 
one was an cake shop. So
 I have sent the 
greetings, to send me  greetings th
rough Petrizharka. Petrizharka was a city at the border where 
I™ve -- see, I™m -- they understood that to go over 
with the parcels of -- of
 -- the greetings were 
the parcels I me ntioned that I want some  food. They
 went over to the city on the border, Austrian 
border, and mailed me exactly what I -- like -- 
instructions I was gi
ving, send me greetings 
through so and so. I received parcels from the m 
with good food, with clothing, with you name  it, 
and it functioned, yeah. So, they handed that over to me , because the SS woma n in charge, who 
was hitting me , was all of a sudden resp
ecting me  because -- you know, I told you why.

bartered for -- with the pi ece 
of bread for potatoes, with 
whom do you barter? Where -- 
A: Not me , I never -- 
Q: No, oh your friend -- your
 -- did your friend -- 
A: -- with -- with the kitchen. 

Q: So you go to the kitchen and give them bread? 

A: That wasn™t -- that was norma l -- norma l pro
cedure, because bread and cigarettes were the 
currency. So if you went to the kitchen and asked 
the wome n t here to give you some  potatoes for 
bread, they took the bread, because they could exchange the br ead for cigarettes. 

Q: For cigarettes. 

A: And then use the cigarettes for who knows what
. I never -- I™ve -- couldn™t do it, so that girl, 
she was a better businesswoman. So we were cooki
ng together, and I had a 
stove in my drawing 
office. Don™t forget that. 

Q: What kind of a stove? 

A: A good one. A very specially built stove, and 
have this on -- ro -- tube, which went up the 
smoke, yeah. And on that tube, we were ironing our -- 

Q: Your dresses? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Really? 

A: Everything. 

Q: So it wo -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
98 
 
A: The tubes were hot, so we just 
ironed our stuff over there, like. 
Q: So did it have burners on top? 
A: No, no, no. 

Q: It was an oven -- oven, so -- 

A: Ov-oven -- iron -- iron oven, yeah. And you had ju
st an iron platter -- th
e pl -- the plate, and 
the tube, but the tube was an important thing, 
we™ll always look very pretty, everything was 
ironed, and good looking. 

Q: And whe r e did you wa sh your clothes? 

A: Washed? 

Q: Did you wash anything? 

A: Yeah. No, not the clothes, but -- 

Q: Yourself? 

A: -- underwear, every -- every -- 
Q: Wa s -- w-was there -- there we
re sinks and latrines in the -- 
A: Huh?  
Q: What wa -- what was in barrack four
, block four?  Did you have running water? 
A: A-Across barrack four was the sauna. 

Q: The sauna, right. 

A: So we went every day for an show
er, and there we could wash ourselves. 
Q: So you were able to go every day. 

A: Huh?  

Q: You were able to go every day. 

A: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
99 
 
Q: That™s unusual. 
A: What? 

Q: Being able to go every day. 

A: Yeah, but you know, I developed some  kind -- at
 wintertime I devel
op -- everybody had a hot 
shower, I developed an itch on my body, and the 
hot water made me mor e itch -- gave me more 
itch. So I had to -- th-the one winter
, I had to shower myself i n icy water, and that helped me  to -
- to stop the itch. 

Q: And wha t  did you do for towels? 

A: Towels? 

Q: Did you wipe yourself off?  

A: No, they -- we had towels. 

Q: You did have towels?  And where™d you get s -- 

A: Organized from th -- Canada, yeah. 
Q: Canada?  And soap also? 
A: Oh, yeah. 

Q: So o -- 

A: I -- I never organi zed
 anything from Canada. 
Q: Other people organized for you? 

A: No, Katya gave me  everything. They brought he
r so many things, and other people, I never 
ma de any contact with those people,
 I did not wanted to be -- to -- 
to be bribed, or to be as -- I 
really kept distance from the 
Canada people. I had enough. Katya 
supplied me , cause she had so 
much, she was sending it constantly, beautif
ul blouses, underwear, any time I need it. 
Q: And why were you -- why were you so hesitant? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
100 
 
A: Because they were corrupt. Corrupt, and 
-- and they were smuggling with gold, and these 
other things, and I™ve never wanted to 
be involved with anybody, just in case. 
Q: So why would you call them corrupt?  What we
re they doing, who were they bribing, SS, or 
the pr -- 

A: On-only top -- top ma nageme nt. 

Q: They were bribing top ma nageme nt?  For 
what, since they were
 already protected? 
A: Yeah, still, to be more protected. 

Q: I see. To be more sure. 

A: I never had anything to do with anybody, thank God.  

Q: Did you know people who got into some  kind of 
trouble because they did?  They were -- they 
were in a compromi sed situation? 

A: I don™t know, I don™t know. 

Q: You don™t know. 
A: No, I don™t know, no.   did not. 
Q: Tell me  about the canteen, because it™s some thing one -- 

A: Canteen? 

Q: Yeah, does -- one doesn™t -- 

A: The canteen was established with -- you had 
-- there were times when you received bonuses, 
and with those vouchers, you could buy -- 

Q: There™s a piece of -- 

A: Huh?  

Q: It was a pi ece of paper that you got? 

A: Yeah, a voucher. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
101 
 
Q: Like a -- uh-huh, like a ticket? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: And they supplied that to some  of the pe
ople, I had some  too, but you could very little 
purchase, a bit of mi neral water,
 or mustard, or 
mussels, or -- 
Q: Mussels? 

A: Mussels, that was good protein, yeah. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: And so -- 

Q: So who ran the canteen?  Pr isoners? 

A: The canteen, I™ll tell you, I 
don™tknow much about thecantee
n. I only know the person who 
was placed into my drawing office, to -- to stickthe coupons on a sheet of paper, just like those 

green stamps, you know?  And that was her job. 
Sometimes the German women brought me a 
present, a bottle of mi neral water,
 yeah, that was a big present, cau
se they had more -- they can -- 
could go into the canteen and buy, yeah. 

Q: Because they had mo ney? 

A: They had money, officially. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And they would buy bonuses of 
-- I don™t -- I don™t even know any mo re what it was, because 
it was so unimportant.  

Q: Where was it, though?  Wher
e was this little canteen? 

A: I didn™t -- I never went there. 

Q: Oh, you never went? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
102 
 
A: No, I just ask people there to use my bonus. 
Q: But it was in the women™s camp ? 

A: Yeah. It -- outside, I think, 
some where. Look, you asking too much. 

Q: Okay. 

A: I really don™t know. 

Q: Okay. 

A: And later on it became unimportant, because
 we had so many good packages, that those 
mussels and mustard were 
not -- no value whatsoever. 
Q: Right, right.  

A: In the beginning, when there wa
s nothing, it was very helpful. 
Q: Huh. 

A: No. 

Q: Right. Okay. Let me  ask you a little bit about 
how the hospital, in so fa r as you know, how the 
hospital was run in the wome n™s camp. Do you know? 

A: I don™t wa nted to know, I don™t want to know
. I had no good relations
hip with the hospital 
admi nistration because they were Poles, and we
re Polish wome n, and anti-Semitic. But some of 
the doctors I have known, and I™ve kept touc -- in 
touch with them up -- up til now. I am in touch 
with Dr. Schreiberwined, I™m in touch with 
Emma Pronska, Emma Weiss, and some of the 
nurses, but I tried to keep out of sight, because
 it was an very infectious -- infectious en-
environment, so I never entered the hospital if I 
had not -- had to -- I mean, I tried to avoid the 
hospital. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
103 
 
A: The whole business. But they had their own sy
stems, they had there every day the roll calls, 
they had to report to us every day, just like 
any other -- other sub-camp, to include the -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- strength of their patients, and bed runs, and 
so ex -- the bed runs, th
e transfer  to the gas 
chamber, the transfers from the camp to the hosp
ital, the transfers fr om the hospital to the camp, 
back again. So it was con -- in constant move me nt
 every day, every day, every day. It all went on 
the appelle sheet, yeah. On the roll call sheet. 

Q: And wha t  did you know then about what 
was happening with pre
gnant wome n and the 
babies? 

A: Pardon?  

Q: What did -- wh -- at  the time -- 

A: Yeah? 

Q: -- what did you know about what was happe
ning with pregnant wome n who were having 
babies, and what was going on with
 the killing of the babies? 
A: Jews, or non-Jews? 

Q: Both. 

A: Huh?  

Q: Both. What do you mean?  

A: The Jewish -- non-Jewish wome n, they could 
keep the babies. The Jewi sh wome n who were 
pregnant upon arrival, or  during the early st  --  or
 post arrival time, were simply killed, with thei r 
babies. That was all far as I know. Then the H
ungarians were comi ng, ma ny of them were in -- 
pregnant in the early stages. 

Q: So they -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
104 
 
A: There were abortions performe d by th
e doctors, secretly, 
and that was all. 
Q: Did the -- do you -- do you -- 
A: Huh?  

Q: Did the wome n know that they
 were having aborti
ons?  Did they realize 
what was going on, or 
was -- 

A: They wanted to have it. 

Q: They wanted to have it. 

A: They wanted to have it, otherwise, how woul
d it -- would the doctors have known that she is 
pregnant? 

Q: How in heaven™s name did they perform -- 

A: Huh?  

Q: -- how did they perform abortions there? 

A: Mm, ver y simple, with everything -- they
 had everything for -- for instrume nts, and 
everythi ng. That Dr. Pearl is telli
ng lies in he r description of how
 she aborted baby with the di rty 
fingernails on the floor, I mean, that™s crazy. 
There was soap, there was everything. She didn™t -- 
she ma de an joke out of the whole business. 

Q: And whe r e did they do this? 

A: In the hospital comp ound. 

Q: In the hospital they di d it? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Uh-huh. You s -- you said that -- 

A: Mm?  

Q: -- that you did your reports very imagin
atively and artistically. What did you me a n? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
105 
 
A: Pardon?  
Q: You once told me  that the reports that you 
wrote for Berlin, you did them i maginatively and 
artistically. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Explain. Don™t touch that. 

A: Why?  

Q: Why?  How -- wh-what -- what™s that mean, you did reports imaginatively? 

A: Imaginative, no. 

Q: Or artistically? 

A: Huh?  

Q: Artistically? 

A: Artistic. 

Q: Yes, cause  the -- 
A: Because an diagram, yeah -- 
Q: Is beautiful. 

A: -- if you have some  ma terial, if you have th
e colors, and if you know your graphics, and i-if 
you know your graphics, you produce some thing whic
h looks -- I would say easy to follow, easy 
to read, and with tast e, yeah? 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Professionally, ma ybe I s --
 use the word professionally. 
Q: Maybe. 

A: Yeah. That I would -- would have used. Of
 course, you™ve -- why not
 artistically?  It was 
important that it is just an diagram, it™s just
 like an composition. If -- 
if I want you to understand 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
106 
 
something, I am using an simple dialog. If I can
 transfer the me ssage through graphics, then you 
have to do that on the simplest, and most -- th
e best way to ma ke your recipient feel good. 
Because othe rwise you ge t an feedba
ck which can put you into trouble. 
Q: And they liked your reports? 
A: I don™t know, I™m -- have never had a compliment -- pardon? 

Q: They liked your reports, they never compli me nted you? 

A: Who should have complimented me ?  They were
 letting me live. You know  th-they liked my 
work, because again I™m telling you the lover of
 Mandel was in th -- in charge of the 
architectural office of Auschwitz, now -- and Birk
enau. And h-he always -- I™m sure that -- and 

Mandel, with that monthly report, was always 
very proud, and she could -- she received probably 
from hi m several compliments, and she neve
r -- they never objected to anything.  
Q: Did writing these reports depress you? 

A: Huh?  
Q: Did writing these reports depress you? 
A: To -- I never write 
-- wrote the reports. 
Q: No, no, no, no, no, I mean the gr -- the 
-- the graphs, the graphs, it didn™t -- 
A: No, no. That was an -- a very creative -- ve
ry creative. Wh y, what is wrong to ma ke a nice 

curve of the daily in
comi ng people, yeah? 
Q: Yes, but you would also have to ma
ke a curve of the people who died. 
A: Those who were gassed, too. 

Q: Right. 

A: Of course that didn™t -- ma
de me  sad, but that was it. 
Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
107 
 
A: You are sad if some body dies here right now. 
If you would ma ke diagrams
 of the city of New 
York, how ma ny died, and how ma ny were bor
n, you would be amazed, you are just doing it 
very, very -- you are dist -- 
Q: Distanced from it. 

A: -- no, there is no feeling. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: I cannot do both. 

Q: Did you ever try, after th
e war, to replicate -- 
A: What? 

Q: -- to -- to repeat what you ha
d done on these diagrams, to -- 
A: What for? 

Q: I don™t -- because -- 

A: You d-don™t repeat some thing th
at there was a daily movement. 
Q: No, no, I understand that. But to -- in some  sense, sh -- 

A: A diagram mi ght -- I did -- I worked after th
e war, I produced ma ny other things, which were 
-- have nothing to do -- a diagram is justan ordinary, simple 
expression of figures. 
Q: Right. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: But you did two copies, right, so that you hid one? 

A: Yes, I left that there, and nobody knows what 
it is, and where it is, and what happened. And 
it™s possibl e that it st ands there in a corner st ill 
today, if they haven™t al
ready [indecipherable] in 
Auschwitz. 

Q: But you™ve told them. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
108 
 
A: Whom?  Who -- who are -- 
Q: You didn™t tell Teresa? 

A: Who are they? 

Q: You didn™t tell? 

A: But does -- but does she know whats a diagra
m is?  Look, what do you -- what do historians 
know?  

Q: We ll, a diagram, if you found it in Auschwitz, 
you would realize you were getting part of the 
history, right? 

A: It would be like the -- lik
e the Dead Sea Scrolls, right? 
Q: Yes, right. 

A: I know that. You don™t know -- you don™t kno
w the world outside New York City, or 
Washington, D.C. If I would have a chance to 
go to Auschwitz, not only that I will find my 
work, yeah, I would be able to deseefert some  document -- 
Q: That others can™t. 
A: Huh?  

Q: That other™s can™t, yeah. Did the me n do th
e same  kind of reports, from the me n™s  camp?  
A: Pardon?  

Q: Did the men construct the sa
me  kind of graphs for Berlin? 
A: No, no, no. 

Q: Was this the women™s idea? Was this Mandel
™s idea, Katya™s idea , yours idea, whose idea? 
All of you?  All right -- 

A: I created the job for myself. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
109 
 
A: And they had no -- nobody in the ma n™s ca mp. 
Q: And how come  -- well, how -- you -- it™s a stupid
 question. I wa -- this is what I was going to 
ask you , but it™s not answerable. 

A: Well, go ahead. 

Q: Why, if Berlin was -- wa
s glad to get your reports -- 
A: Yeah? 

Q: -- didn™t they say to the me
n, we want these reports from the me n™s ca mp?  No, of course you 
don™t know. 

A: How should I know? 

Q: I don™t know, Sip. 

A: As you can see, we repro -- we did things me n couldn™t do.  

Q: You did the res -- reports on
ce a month, right?  And so 
that they would be different graphs for 
different -- showing the di
fferent circumstances, you at one point told me  -- 
A: [indecipherable] movement. 
Q: -- there were 18 differe
nt curves and colors. 18 
A: 18. 

Q: Every single month. 

A: Yes, sir.  

Q: So -- so name some of the thi
ngs that you were gr
aphing, that™s -- 
A: Hm?  

Q: You were -- you were graphing people comi
ng in, so you were graphing population changes 
of -- in -- of incomi ng. 

A: Incomi ng, outgoing. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
110 
 
Q: Outgoing. 
A: Dying, gassing, work details.  

Q: So that would be a number of them. 

A: Huh?  

Q: Different -- different ones. 

A: With th-the work force. 

Q: Right. 

A: [indecipherable] work force. 

Q: Right. 

A: So?  

Q: It™s a lot of work. 

A: It was.  

Q: How did you come  up, or why did you come  up 
with the idea of ma king 
a model of ow -- of 
the wome n™ s camp?  Did you just come  up with that? 

A: I tell you. I had an desk, work
ing desk like that, big like that. 
Q: Like a --  like a kitchen ta
ble -- like a dining room table? 
A: Yeah, mm-hm. 

Q: Right. 

A: And every time an SS man was asked to go to
 a certain barrack, he was -- they were comi ng 
to the camp office to ask where the ba rrack is, ye
ah?  Now, then they have sent them t o me , I 
should tell. So, after aw
hile I™ve decided -- 
Q: You were the tour ist offi ce. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
111 
 
A: Yeah. After awhile I™ve decided I™m going to ma ke
 an -- with a pencil, an plan on the desk -- 
top of the table, to put in those blocks, how th
ey are located, with everyt hi ng in the scale from 
one two. So I measured out the whole camp, a
nd everything,and ma de 
myself a line drawing 
with pencil, on the top of the desk, and put the 
number of the block in. So when an SS ma n was 
comi ng, and asking where is the block, I told him 
I could show hi m i mme diately where it is. So 
when I noticed it worked so nice
ly, I had the plan flat on my de
sk, I said I™m going to build the 
barracks, and in colors exactly, and I™m going 
to ma ke an little model, without asking anybody. 
The ma terial I had, and when I started, and Ma
ndel once visited, and thought what I™m -- and 
saw what I am doing, she said [indecipherable] 
and Hessler was there. ﬁCarry on, you can do 
anything, you can measure out whatever you want. 
But, don™t include the crematorium.  You can 
put anything on, but no crematorium. ﬂ Okay. So I 
engaged in little -- Hans
 [indecipherable] was 
an architectural student in Poland, 
or in France, and we are started 
to build that nice little model. 
It was so nice we ma de [indecipherable] barbed
 wire, everything was on. So -- soil, glued -- put 
the glue on, and sprinkled sand on so it stuck. I 
ma de an professional model, okay, out of the 
camp. Now, then I had an friend who was one of
 the Polish underground workers. He was an 
electrician, and him I engaged to put
 me in front of the entrance an 
little barb, electric barb like 
an -- like an -- what we had over there, a
nd underneath I had the battery, and so when you 

touched the two things, the camp wa s illumi nated, 
yeah. Wa s an good model, very professional. 
Then, one nice day they were -- put me  on an gl
ass top on that, and were
 taking it out to the 
commandant, Hesse, into his office. That was the 
end of it. Do you know it™s possible that it is 

still st anding some where. 

Q: So me wh ere. 

A: And wha t  I did, I put my number, 
I marked the model with my number. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
112 
 
Q: Oh, you did. 
A: It™s signed. 

Q: Did you paint it -- 

A: Huh?  

Q: -- so it was really -- it looked 
really professional, you painted it? 
A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

Q: Did you put people in it,
 too, or just the -- 
A: No. 

Q: No. So you didn™t have any -- 
did anyone take pictures of it? 
A: No. 

Q: No. 

A: Who?  

Q: I don™t know.  
A: Who, we ?  Of the inma tes? 
Q: No, no, no, no, no. 

A: I have no idea what they did. But ever
y time , whenever some
body was visiting, an high 
official, instead to -- what they did in prior years, to demonstrate how people are getting 25 on 

their buttocks, they brought thehigh officials into my office, a
nd showed him the -- the model, 
yeah. 

Q: Yes, you said that, that ra
ther than watching some body bei ng 
beaten, that this became  a 
substitute. 

A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

Q: Isn™t that strange? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
113 
 
A: Why?  
Q: We ll, I don™t know. How does one substitute
 -- this was a way of entertaining them?  
A: Because -- look, I don™t know, it happened that -- 
it turned out that it was very beneficial for 
the camp, that there was never -- there was neve
r again, since I ma de the model, they had -- you 
see, they were showing off with something al ways, but nobody ever perf
orme d the 25 since then. 
They were proud of their model, yeah. 

Q: So they wanted to show that. 

A: Isn™t that funny? 

Q: Strange. 

A: Yeah. I don™t even know what high officials I 
had in that dr awing office, because there were 
really a lot of very impor tant looking peopl
e. I know one thing, Hitler wasn™t there. 

Q: Right. 

A: But, with those primitive SS people, I once made a joke, but it was not a joke, it turned out to 
be a very good -- good weapon. They always as
ked me , ﬁ W hat kind of an profession do you 
have? ﬂ  I did that, I did that, what kind of a pr
o -- I said, ﬁThe same  like your fuhrer.ﬂ Yeah. 
Q: Did they keep quiet then? 
A: Oh. 

Q: Yes? 

A: Can you imagine?  No, we are laughing now, but it was -- 

Q: Yeah. 

A: -- for me then, I -- I tried 
to -- to keep those people out of
 my way. Sa me  profession as your 
fuhrer. Son of a bitches. Now, what can I te
ll you?  Any other question, 
or are you too tired? 
Q: I™m s -- I™m s -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
114 
 
A: Would you like to wa -- a cup of coffee or some thing? 
Q: I™m starting to get tired. 

A: Huh?

Q: This is the United Stat es Holocaust Memori
al Museum interview with Helen  Tichauer, on 
September eighth, 2000, in New York City. This 
is tape number five, side A, interview 
conducted by Joan Ringleheim. Sippy, is there --
 is there anything after we left each ot her 
yesterday -- 
A: Yeah? 

Q: -- that you thought yo
u wanted to clarify? 
A: I went to sleep. 

Q: You went to sleep, okay. 

A: I was tired. I just realized af
terwards, clarify we w
ill, after you™ve make an
 -- after we™ll make 
an transcript. 

Q: Right, okay. 

A: That I can correct, yeah? 
Q: Okay, okay. 
A: There I will be able to clarify better th-than 
-- you see, I must see cert
ain things in front of 
me .  

Q: Right, okay. 

A: I™m a visual person. 

Q: Right. Well let me -- let me ask you something. 

A: Yeah? 

Q: What is it -- what -- what is
 it about the structure of Auschw
itz that  you th -- the women -- the 
wome n™s camp, that you think most ordi
nary prisoners who went through -- 
A: Yeah? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
116 
 
Q: -- and are being interviewed, don™t understand? 
A: I can™t tell you -- 

Q: Is it everything? 

A: -- it™s very -- it™s not Auschwitz only. Let™s compare -- and I like to compare Auschwitz with 

the present civilian envi ronment, yeah? 

Q: Okay. 

A: Because we are living in a norma l life, in 
a normal environment. Who f -- f -- I me an, New 
York is an big city, but a little village, a li
ttle -- an borough, whatever 
community, what does the 
ordinary person know about the structure of the ci
ty hall?  In spite of the fact that we have 
television performa nce, exposure, 
we know that people can come  a
nd discuss it, and present their 
problems, and there™s a group of people, com- co
mmittees, and so on, who are listening, who are 
going ahead, and are engaged in problem solvi
ng, and betterment of certain ma lfunctions, t-
trying to help, and to ma ke life more bearab
le. But who -- who knows how -- how the system 
works?  Who knows the mechanics?  Now why shoul
d the ordinary person in Auschwitz have 
known the mechanics of the camp, or the camp l
eadership?  Why are we 
expecting that?  Only 
those who were engaged, or are engaged toda
y in city hall business 
will know, and know, and 
know how to go ahead, and how to conduct th
e certain sessions, and how to conduct the 
leadership.I mean, how to engage
 in the leadership, and what 
to do. The ordinary -- I don™t know 
what the -- how they are -- how it works. And ther
e™s no plan of -- of s -- simplified to explain to 
the public, not even who is who. And who -- who™
s -- who is doing what. 
Wh- Why do we expect 
-- know that ev-every ordinary, poor, ex, di
rty, stinky inma te, hungry, half-dead muss elma n, 
should know what happened in Birkenau, a
nd in Auschwitz?  Is 
that an answer? 
Q: That™s a good answer. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
117 
 
A: Good. 
Q: But let me  -- let me  ask you it in a -- in a different way. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: It™s one thing for ordinary people -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- not to know exactly what the stru
cture is, and -- in any kind of detail. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: It™s another thing for them to not know that th
ere™s any structure. So 
-- so, a lot of people, 
certainly before I me t you -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- ma ny years ago -- 

A: No. 

Q: -- I never -- it could be my stupidity, of course -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- as opposed to anything else, but I never 
thought that there was -- I never thought about a 
structure. Di -- di -- do you know wh
at I mean?  And I think that that™s
 true, I think that™s true for 
a lot of people, el
 -- over the years. 
A: Good, we were prisoners. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: Yeah? There is a prison system in the United States. 

Q: Right. 

A: Who knows about the prison system?  
Who ask about it?  Who cares about it? 
Q: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
118 
 
A: Yeah?  The prisoners themselves
, today, they™re interested in one
 thing, to have food, to have 
me dical care, to -- not to e -- be exposed to brut
ality by their guards, but 
-- and some  of them 
may be interested in the jury le
g -- jury -- legal system, yeah?   
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And learn more about the law, and they have
 a chance to -- even to study, but how ma ny of 
those people will, after their sent ence, be engage
d in the cil --  in ci vil law?  Just few who are 
interested. And same  thing as here. Those who su
rvived and were -- became  interested later on, 
what really happened to them, they have learned, 
and they know a little bit more than the average 
person. But they participated in 
one thing, all of those -- of thos
e who -- who are able to speak 
out. They mu-must reme mber how they were -- how they were perform -- not perform,  transform 

from being an civilian into an inmate. They re
me mber, even if a little bit, and not everything, 
how they -- what happened to them when they 
were stripped naked, when they were shaved, 
yeah, when they were registered ma ybe, yeah. Th
en driven into an barrack, and all those basic 
things, they have reme mbered them. 

Q: Right, right.  

A: They remember they had an blockelteste. 

Q: Right. No, you™re right, you™re right. 

A: Yeah?  Now what -- why must they reme mbe r  
anything else what they never ec -- never -- 
they were never exposed 
to anything else, yeah? 
Q: Yeah, right, yeah, you™re right. 

A: So it is not just the people don™t know, they 
were never exposed to anything. And they were 
interested in one thing, to sleep
 and to eat. They were the two enemies, sleeplessness, I me an -- 
Q: And starvation. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
119 
 
A: -- the lack of the chance to sleep enough, and 
to eat enough. And s -- hygiene, and then come s 
medical facilities, let alone a medication, or we
ll-being during an -- an roll call, yeah. The roll 
call was actually the center of
 everything. Everything was bui
lt around the roll call, yeah. 
Q: So food is built around the roll call? 
A: Depended on the roll call, th
e food supply, if there were a 
thousand people, and you have 
received 900 rations, yeah, there was an problem. 
So as we me ntioned yesterday, and I explained 
to you that the ma le prisoners -- the non-Jewish
 ma le prisoners, who were there much earlier 
than the Jewish prisoners, ma le and fema le, th
e ma le prison -- non-Jewish ma le prisoners were 
ma inly ex-military pe ople, fren -- from France, 
from each country. They knew what an roll call 
is, they knew that an -- the for mation into five a
nd all that, is of i mportance to ma ke things easier 
and quicker, but the wome n did not understood, and th
e Jewish ma le, especially of the religious 
sect, di d not understood, yeah. Now they think that
 they ha ve committed an act of resi st ance, 
those idiots, yeah? That was no act of resistance, 
to -- to made it impossible to be counted, that  
was an k-killing situation. They were beaten, they
 were -- they have extended the duration of the 
roll call, and a -- the s -- it -- st
upidity of they™re not allowed to 
be counted, and a
ll that, did not 
help, so again -- and we were not soldiers, the 
wome n were not soldiers, 
ex-soldiers, we didn™t 
know what it meant in the beginning 
at least, and then later on, of
 course it -- we have learned 
what -- what the roll call is, but it was an to
rture, because we hadn™t -- the people had no 
experience, they didn™t understood. And everybody wa
nted to stand during a 
lo -- roll call with 
her sister, while moving forward, and backwards, a
nd they were -- they had the ti -- never ma de 
any sense. They -- they did not unders tood, nobody™s there to explain, yeah, so. 

Q: Di -- wh-when you -- when you f -- when you fo
lks came up with your system of doing the 
roll call, the pre 
-- the pre-appelle. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
120 
 
A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, right. 
Q: Did you try to create a system where the bl
ockelteste would explain to the wome n what you 
were doing, so that they wouldn™
t act in this chaotic way? 
A: The blockelteste, no. Th-There
 wa s told -- look, people in ch
arge had certain obli -- had 
certain -- no -- had an obligation, 
certain obligation to te
ll the people, come  out, we have to count 
you. Stand in fi -- in -- in five rows, yeah. W
ho had time, in an hungry, w
ild, hoard, th -- the -- it 
was an wild hoard of people, yeah, who had tim
e to speak and to explain, and who was listening, 
yeah?  There was an ordered, do 
that, yeah. If you didn™t -- 
Q: And ordered what? 

A: -- a order, do that, go stand in five -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- in perf -- in five of rows, yeah. 

Q: Uh-huh.  
A: That was the order. If you did it, fi ne. If
 not, you were hit. Th
ere was hitting going on, 
pushing, kicking, screaming. So that was not an
 normal situation, you had hungry, wild people, 
who didn™t know what is going on, and nit -- did not understood, and you could not talk, because 
there was no time to talk. You -- if you wanted 
that people should do some thing, you s -- the f -- 

you were giving an order, and if they did not obe
y to the order, they were be-beaten, and once 
they were beaten, things -- it 
was an horrible situation. And then the SS came  in, and they were 
comi ng with dog. They had to be -- it -- it was 
an wild horde of hungry, mi serable people, yeah, 
in the beginning. Later on, when they have learne
d -- it took awhile, that if they are going out, 
and they do that quick as possible,
 they can go back quick as possibl
e. That meant they could rest 
longer, they could sleep longer, there was no b
eating. But it took awhile, 
but there was no tal -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
121 
 
look, you™re Mrs. Lehrma n, in one of her speeches 
that were printed in -- in the newsletter, 
explained that she was -- some thing happened du
ring roll call, and the blockelteste took an 
bucket of cold water and -- and -- over her 
body, I don™t know why. She must have been wild, 
too, because she must have ec -- beha ved just 
like what I expl ained to you before, that an 
blockelteste will use water fe -- every drop of 
water was so precious, she must have be haved 
impossible, yeah. But that she doesn™t know, an
d does not even bother to explain. Then she 
me ntions the name  of the blockelteste, yeah. Th
at woma n lives here, and I know her very well. 
She was not an bitch, she was a normal human 
being, who was living later on in a displaced 
person camp, and believe me , she would have been
 such an horrible woma n, she wouldn™t have 
survived one day. So, she doesn™t 
even bother to find out who that
 blockelteste was, yeah. You 
know s -- her name , she me ntioned her name . So 
the bucket of water, that was the big -- big 
event that she used a bucket of
 water to calm her down. But can you imagine how wild she must 
have been?  And we had ma n- ma ny, ma ny of 
those people, who just turned crazy.  
Q: Did the camp office workers have to go on roll call? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: With -- with just -- in the ba
 -- the barrack -- barracks four
, five and six -- I mean that™s 
barracks four -- barrack four. 

A: Every -- every -- 

Q: Everybody. 

A: -- roll call was in front of the barrack. 

Q: Right. But you were how ma
ny people in that barrack?   
A: Nearly hundred. 

Q: And all of -- everybody working for the camp office? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
122 
 
A: Or individuals who worked in one capacity of
 secretaries or so, out
side of the camp, who 
went out every day. But they were part of 
the camp office. On the -- the work place or 
some where, not concentrated where we -- yea
h, it was the camp, it was the office -- the office 
workers of the camp. 
Q: So -- so let™s -- let™s do 
this just a little bit again. 

A: No. 

Q: The roll call really 
is -- is the information, in order 
for almost everything to function. 
A: Logistic -- logistics. 

Q: So it™s -- it™s food, it™s
 clothing, it™s work, it™s
 move me nt, everything. 
A: Everything. It was the -- real 
heart, the be-beating heart of en
tizil. It wa s the most important 
function, the most important function of the whole 
camp, and it is just too bad that Laura Shelley 
did not understood what she did w
ith the secretaries of that. 
Q: No, it™s interesting, because 
the only thing that you get -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- as far as I can tell, when wome n talk 
about the roll call, is how diffi cult it was. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Not the way it functioned -- at 
-- and you™re right, how would th
ey know, but in spite of the 
fact of studying it for so long, I myself have not
, until now, really underst
ood that without that, 
you can™t do anything in that cam
p, for good or ill. Either killing pe
ople, or saving people, that™s 
the heart of it. That™s very interesting. So 
tell me something. In terms of food rations, di -- 
amounts of food -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Who ma de the decision what
 a ration was for one person? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
123 
 
A: Wa it a minute. Those decisions were ma de for 
-- merely for the whole system in all Germany, 
so it was ma de at an very high level. I couldn™
t tell you where, and who was responsible for it, 
but just like the civi lian population had their 
food rations, and which applied to each Ge rman 
citizen, and -- or applied to -- to the German 
population of an certain
 working group, like light 
industry, or heavy industry, or what
ever, there we re certain standards set, yeah. Now, so they 
were set certain standards for th
e concentration camp population, a
nd we have information of the 
caloric intake, and the caloric standards, orsupplies for the civilian population, and for the 
working population in the -- and in
 the working -- in the camp  population. Now, those special 
rations which every two weeks or so were supplie
d to heavy -- to indus -- to workers who were 

working in heavy industry -- prisoners or civilian
s were some times identical, yeah. And there are 
studies made, there are tables, ther
e are reports on that. I couldn™t te
ll you that by heart, but it is 
available, and the East Germans did that 
already after the war, and published that.  

Q: Uh-huh. 
A: In ma ny publications, so if th
at is of interest to you, you can 
go into the files and -- and look 
into that, easily. 
Q: Right. But all right, so however, you -- the 
camp office would say, there are X number of 
wome n. 

A: Oh no. 

Q: And -- and -- and -- then 
so who -- how does that -- 
A: X num -- no, the population in the camp, ma
n or wome n, had the same  supply, food supply, 
yeah? 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
124 
 
A: And the order what to supply, on
 an daily or weekly or monthly 
basis, was not decided in -- in 
the camp. Not in the camp, not in the headquarter
s of the SS. It was -- it was comi ng from an 
higher authority, I couldn™t tell you where from, yea
h, but when every day is a kitchen -- it was a 
kitchen where you have to collect 
your bread, in the kitchen you 
-- the bread rations of an gi-
given day, yeah. All week they were five -- for 
five people, one bread, or
 four people, or two 
people, yeah. And accordingly, they had suppl
ied to the barracks, some  bread rations. 
Q: [indecipherable] 

A: If there was ma rgarine, the kitchen had the 
order to supply for 10 people one cube, or five 
people, whatever. The kitchen was the one who 
-- who supplied -- you supplied the kitchen with 
the amount of people, and you were rec -- you r
eceived the amount of ra tions. But they had the 
orders from some where, yeah, I couldn™t tell you
 where from. We  had nothing to do with that, 
the -- we couldn™t care less.  

Q: Okay, but wo -- suppose you said, I don™t know, 10,000 people -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- need to be fed today -- 

A: Right. 

Q: -- right?  But they only gave you -- I mean, would it happen -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- that they would give you rations for only 900? 

A: No. 

Q: It wouldn™t happen? 

A: No. But that happened in the beginning, because
 they were not quite sure, and they never 
received the proper amount -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
125 
 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: -- of people, because the roll call was not orga
nized, and wa s contro -- out of control, because 
the system was not established. But the mo ment
 when Katya took over, there was no way that 
some body would have gone hungry to bed, yeah. Fo r each person, it -- if -- for each person 

reported, there was an ration, the daily ration. No ma tter what. It never happened. 

Q: But -- 

A: It did not happen. And if by accide nt some thing happened, then the blockelteste wa s clever 

enough to su -- to -- to divide the rations 
so that everybody had some thing to eat, yeah. 
Q: Now, the rations, were they ma inly soup, 
and bread, and some margarine someti mes, and 

s o me t i me s  - -  

A: Yes, and twice a week, an little piece of -- of sausage. There ar
e people today, listen carefully, 
who swear they have never s
een an piece of ma rgarine. Th
ey simply don™t reme mber. Who 
swear they never had -- no -- never even knew that
 there is some thing else. They had some ti me s 
an bit of ma rmalade, someti mes cheese. That 
was everybody, but they don™t reme mbe r  any more, 
I don™t know why.  

Q: So how -- how would -- how would these come
 to the barrack? The soup was carried in big 

kettles. 

A: The people from the barracks -- 

Q: Would come? 

A: No, they have f -- the -- the block stubendien
st, yeah, those who were engaged in the block 
personnel, they had to go in the morning and get 
the -- the tea, or coffee,
 or whatever they had, 
they had to go in between and bring the bread, 
al -always to the kitchen. The kitchen supplied 
everything, yeah. In the kitchen, 
the portions were cut. In the 
kitchen everything was prepared, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
126 
 
so it was easy to -- to count if
 one cube of ma rgarine was for 10 people, so 100 people to be 
supplied, you had 10 -- 10 cubes, yeah?  It was no
t -- no big deal. The soup was always carried -- 
the kitchen supplied an -- an -- 
pa -- the personnel from each barrack
 had to go to the kitchen and 
collect their -- thei r portions. 
Q: So the kitchen worked very hard? 

A: Very. There were very strong people working 
in the kitchen, too, but it
 was ma inly reserved 
for Poles. In the wome n™ s kitchen were Polish wome n only. 

Q: And you had said that they were me mb
ers of the Resistance that had come  in? 
A: Some of them, some of them. 

Q: Some of them. But you always
 said that  they were fair. 
A: Who?  

Q: The  Poles in the kitchen. Differe
nt from whe n the Hungarians came. 
A: Oh yes. The Hungarians were stealing. Oh
 God, oh God. And not only that, the Hungarians 
were cruel, stupid -- some of them -- stupid pe
ople. There were an couple of -- of Norwegian 
prisoners in the camp, males. They we re so mean
 to them, they did not understood Europe, yeah, 

they were comi ng just like the pe
ople out of the ghetto
 in -- in Romania or where -- where Elie 

Wi esel comes from, those little shtetls. They neve
r hear d of a rest -- the re
st of Europe. And right 
in the camp, there were Norwegians, big, clums
y, yeah, good types of pe -- but couldn™t speak 
anything. De finitely not Yiddish. And they were
 calling the Norwegians the Eskimos, can you 
imagine?  And were ma king fun of [inaudible], a
nd were mean. After the war, it™s very little 
known, the Norwegian governme nt took in Jewish
 refugees, under one condition, no Hungarians. 
No Hungarian Jews. They were not allowed 
to enter no -- Norway, and nobody knew why, yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
127 
 
It was an silent, secret, unwritten regulation a
nd law, yeah. But I can tell you why, yeah. Let -- 
but I -- I would not me ntion that -- oh, I w
ould like to have that off record, yeah.  
Q: You at one time said to me  that when you w
ould get the morning liquid, 
the tea or the coffee -
- 
A: Yeah. 

Q:  -- that rather than dri
nking it, you would clean yours -- 
A: We  were washing ourselves, yeah, yeah. 

Q: -- yes, and that that would be s -- it woul
d have been smart for everybody to do that, rather 
than drinking it. 

A: Yeah. We -- not -- not smart, I me an we were 
hydra -- dehydrated, too. So if you have used an 

couple of sips, was good enough for your body, but 
you could clean your genitals, you could 
clean your face, your hands, whatever. You can, with 
an piece of a rag, if it™s wet, can clean your 
whole body, yeah. You know that. Even patients in 
an hospital are washed with a little bit of 
water, and that is good enough. 
So, that what we did.  
Q: Did a lot of wome n do that, or ma inly
 in the camp office?  I™m just wondering. 
A: I don™t know -- 
Q: You don™t know. 

A: -- if the pe ople in the camp offi
ce. I did it in -- in the camp o
ffice we had water. In the camp 
office, we had other conditions. 

Q: Oh. 

A: But I did it in an time when we had no access 
to anything, in the beginning, especially. I did 
it, but I don™t know what the 
others did, really not.  

Q: Now the ma rgarine, you said you also put on your face -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
128 
 
A: Exactly. 
Q: -- so that it wouldn™t dry out. 

A: Every day, I have used more margarine on th
e face then, than I am using cosmetics today, 
yeah. And I ma ssaged my face every day, every dayin the morning, after I washed the face with 

ma rgarine, and not only that, the rest of my
 hands , I™ve smoothed, went over my hairdo, yeah, 
and it was shining. So I looked pretty well groomed, by usi ng the existing -- the existing -- what 

shall I tell you?  It™s ex
isting na -- material, or 
whatever, yeah. That what I did. I don™t know what 
the others did, yeah. And definitely never discuss 
what to do. It was an drive, it was an natural 
drive to look smooth, to look good, because to have
 cracks around your lips, or s -- on your skin 

m- meant some ti me s death. People we re selected for that, yeah. 

Q: Right. 

A: I have massaged my fingers, my hands. I never 
-- I really had better -- in those days I looked 
better much more often [indecipherable] today. Today I am using ordinary water and soap. There 
I have used at least cream, and I don™t use a
ny lotion. I don™t know why, 
but I massaged my face, 
around my e yes, just like the book said, with ma
rgarine. And during outdoor works, the sun 
ma de such an nice -- such a good work, the sun 
and ma rgarine is giving 
you such an beautiful 
tan, yeah.  
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: You didn™t know that. 

Q: I™m going to have to stop the tape. 

A: Good. 

Q: Okay?  This is the end of tape number five, side A. 
End of Tape Five, Side A 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
129 
 
Beginning Ta pe Five, Side B 
Q: Okay, this is the United States Holocaust  Memorial Museum interview with Helen Tichauer, 
September eighth, 2000, tape number five, side B, 
conducted by Joan Ringleheim. That™s quite a 
story. 

A: What™s astory? 

Q: The story about how you used the 
food in order to protect yourself. 
A: I have an other woma n here, an girl who used
 to be a girl, she lives
 in Australia now. I 
received some  photos fr om her, she is over 80, 
ol der than I am, looks good, beautiful face, s -- 

everything looks good. So, at an occasion, while be
ing on the phone with her, I have ask her, 
ﬁTell me , when did you had your last face lift?ﬂ Y
eah?  I -- I was very honest, and expected an 
honest answer. She said, ﬁI beg 
your pardon?  Didn™t you told me  
to use margarine in Auschwitz 
for my face? I never had a facelift, and I have the 
best skin you can imagine, and thanks to you.ﬂ  
Q: So she used margarine? It was 
a very cheap way of getting a facial. 
A: Yeah, but she -- she learned that fr om me  there. 

Q: Right. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: And you didn™t reme mber telling her? 

A: Oh yes. 

Q: Oh, you do? 

A: She noticed what I™m doing, so she did it too. 

Q: So ma ybe we should tell everybody to do this? 

A: Look, what do you -- what 
do you think about my face? 
Q: It™s in very good shape. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
130 
 
A: Pardon?  
Q: Very good shape. 

A: In good shape? 

Q: Yeah, you don™t have a lot of lines. 

A: If I have lines, they are from the time when 
I had my -- my skull broken, and my - -  and my f-

face was split open, and ther
e™s the scars, yeah?  
Q: Right. 

A: But I don™t have any lines over my chin. 

Q: Right. 

A: Not chin, what is that? Forehead. 

Q: Forehead. 

A: I don™t have any lines like the crocodile of -- 
you -- have you ever -- ever noticed the face of -
- what is the name  of the cosmetic company?  He
lena Rubenstein, the old lady. If you look at her, 
that face of her, on her -- one 
of [indecipherable], she looks like 
an crocodile, and she had all the 
-- the best possible way of using her cosmetic 
for herself, right?  She had the money, a nd the 
ma ssages, and everything. So, if she would ha
ve used, instead of whatever she used, ma r-
ma rgarine, she would never develop -- she would 
have never developed the crocodile skin. No -- 
anyhow, I once said -- 

Q: So did you use ma rgarine after the war, too? 

A: No. 

Q: No. 

A: But I have -- you know what I have used?  Th
ey should pay me  for that, what I am saying 
now, some  -- I should collect some  
-- what are -- what are you calli
ng that in English, if -- if you 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
131 
 
get interest, of -- no, not 
interest. I am not -- in an commercial,
 yeah, you get so and so much if 
you ma ke an commercial, and if 
you repeat that [indecipherable] 
Q: Right. Residuals. 
A: Huh?  

Q: Residuals. 

A: Okay, I should get now those residuals for -- fr om the m, but I have used them all my life, 

yeah. Nothing else, but nothi
ng whatsoever. N-i-v-e-a. 

Q: Nivea?  

A: You know what that is? 

Q: Nivea?  Nivea. 

A: Nivea. 

Q: Yeah. That™s it? 

A: That™s it. 
Q: Okay. Sippy, what about clothe
 -- distribution of clothes? 
A: Yeah. 
Q: When -- when  people were -- were regi stered -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- and they lost th
eir normal clothes -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- and they had to be given stuff. The Jewish
 wome n are not given unif
orms, or they™re given 
uniforms?  It™s not a uniform, right? 

A: In the beginning -- 

Q: Yeah, you had Russian -- the Russian uniforms, yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
132 
 
A: Yeah, in the beginning, but then there were no
 Russian uniforms more, so they have taken -- 
while sorting the stuff which they have taken aw
ay from the newcomers, the good stuff went to 
Germany, into the Reich, and the less -- th-th -- 
those which looked more cheap and -- and not so 
good, were then supplied the beglidinskamme r, the 
clothing barrack, and were
 stored there, and 
distributed to other Jewish newcome r s, while 
the non-Jewish newcomers received the striped 
clotheses. But, so if you have s -- then, when 
people were selected for better jobs, Jewi sh 
wome n, they were dressed in
to striped clotheses, too. 
Q: So is that what you wore? 
A: Yes, but after that, we switched back 
to civilian clotheses, but good ones, yeah. 
Q: Why?  

A: Huh?  

Q: Why?  

A: Because they wanted us to look -- it was su
mmer, and it -- summertim
e the stripedstuff was 
too heavy, so they even supplied the non-Jewish wo
me n with civilian clothese
s, but they were all 
-- b -- they were all lightweight uniforme d -- unifo
r med material dresses, specially sewn for the 
prisoners, yeah. 

Q: And who sewed them?  In the pr
ison, or -- or in Auschwitz, or  
A: I don™t know where -- 

Q: You don™t know where. 

A: -- they were comi ng from. We don™t know who 
did the striped clotheses, yeah. That we don™t 
know. I don™t know, at least. But th-the
y are not produced in Auschwitz, no.  
Q: And ki -- 

A: Well, it was for the whole German -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
133 
 
Q: Yeah, the system. 
A: --prison system, yeah, so. 

Q: Right. And when they gave out clothes -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- to the newcomers -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- to the Jewish wo me n -- 

A: Oh, they exchanged clothes be tween summer a nd winter, yeah. 

Q: Even for the Jewish wo me n?  

A: Huh?  

Q: The Jewish wi -- the j -- 

A: It -- the clothing barracks -- 
the whole bi -- business over there,
 they -- in the beginning, they 
had, for each newcomer, a dress, yeah, in the wo me n™s camp, and for the me n they had their 
trousers, and whatever. And exchanged -- clothe
ses were either exchange  after delousing 
process, not always. Sometimes you received the sa
me  stuff back, but some times they just took 
the stuff away and supplied you with different 
things. Now, what is it you would like to know? 
Q: We ll, people would say that women would get,
 if they were short they would get large 
clothes, if they were tall -- 
A: S-So what? 

Q: -- s-so that -- what did -- what did they do when they -- 

A: Now who cared, who cared? The -- 
we had no Bloomi ndales over there. 

Q: No, I understand. But if you were very 
short, and you had some thing very long -- 
A: Yeah, no -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
134 
 
Q: -- it would be very difficult, so 
what would -- people w
ould switch clothes? 
A: No, but you could go to your -- 
to your kapo, or to your -- see, 
kapos were at the workplace, 
or to your blockelteste at th -- 
in the barrack, and demonstrate, a
nd the blockelteste could then go 
to the -- to the cl-clothing barrack, a
nd a -- and ask for an exchange, yeah.  
Q: Distinguish for me  the differe
nce between the beglidinskammer -- 
A: I beg your pardon? 
Q: Distinguish Canada -- 

A: Yeah? 

Q: -- comma ndo from be glidinkskammer -- the clothing. Wha t  is the difference between these 

two? 

A: Oh, well the Canada commando was the comma
ndo who sorted allinco
mi ng belongings from 
the people -- from the new arrivals. They
 were not only clothing, there were -- 
Q: Everything. 
A: -- everything. And that was on the sortings facility for everything, yeah. And they had nothing 
whatsoever to do with those people who worked
 in the clothing barrack, because there were 
clothes -- clothing and shoes, and 
linen -- not linen, clothing, shoe
s, some  underwear, some  head 
covers for the prisoners only, yeah. There 
were hundred and thousand, and thousands, and 
thousands of prisoners. So, don™t th
ink that there was nothing to do. 
Q: No, no, no, I -- I™m -- I™m not saying that, but -- 

A: Canada had -- 

Q: -- is it nothing to do -- 

A: -- nothing whatsoever. 

Q: So, what is comi ng in to the be
gl idinskammer is the -- is the -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
135 
 
A:  The l e ft overs -- 
Q: -- is the issue -- 

A: -- the leftovers from t he Canada, which coul
d not be sent to th -- to the Reich, yeah. 
Q: I see. 

A: Those things which were -- those dresses 
which were of low quality, we re supplied to the 
beglidinskammer for distribution. 

Q: But the beglidinskamme r also got sort of German issue. They got uniforms that were comi ng 

in from the outside. So they had two 
kinds of ma terial comi ng in. Lefto -- 
A: Two kinds of supplies. 

Q: Plies. 

A: Right. 

Q: Right. 

A: But -- yeah. And it was quite an big enterprise, yeah. There were 600 
people working in that 
business. 

Q: In the beglidinskamme r?  So it wa s a big storehouse? 

A: It was the incomi ng stuff, and outgoing stuff had 
to be counted, had to be prepared, had to be 

bundled, yeah. Wa s constant move ment. And don™t fo
rget the beglidinskammer had to supply the 
branch camps, wherever a woma n was, just the same , yeah. They some times changed very often 

their clothes, more often than 
-- than the outdoor workers. So th
ey have supplied them with new 
clothing, or clean clothi
ng, and received the dirty one, yeah. 
It was an clearinghouse for constant 
change, especially the odds -- the branch camps
 were very well looked 
after, yeah, they are 
always well dressed, clean. That was an very im
portant function, the func
tion of the -- of the 
clothing from barrack, yeah. Very important. In the 
beginning they were full 
of lies, but later on, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
136 
 
it was whenever you have -- whenever you could s
ee somebody from those branch camps, they 
looked just like out of the box, beautifully 
dressed. Everything was beautiful, clean. 
Q: But that wasn™t true of people 
who were in Auschwitz itself, o -- 
A: No, no. 
Q: Right. So they would cl
ean the clot hes for the -- 
the branch [indecipherable] 
A: Every -- a-all the cl
othes, it™s not -- 
Q: But not -- 

A: -- not only for -- they would clean for the i
ndoors too, but not -- not un
der -- under such care, 
and -- and -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: It depend -- 

Q: [indecipherable] 

A: Huh?  
Q: [indecipherable] 
A: It -- the -- in -- inside workers of the cam
p -- of the ma in c a mp, were well dressed, too, yeah, 
clean. They could -- the blockelt
este had som- some ti me s an probl
em to take the whole barrack, 
and to exchange the -- to stand 
there in front of the beglidinsk
ammer, in front of the clothing 
barrack, and exchange dresses, yeah. So they re
ceived clean ones, and they left the dirty ones. 
Q: In the -- in the wintertime , when it got very cold -- 

A: Yeah? 

Q: -- who wa -- who was able to get coats or
 jackets, or sweate
rs? It certainly -- 
A: You could -- you coul d -- the blockelteste 
could ask for sweaters, and receive for each 
me mber of the barrack an sweater 
under the clothes, to wear, yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
137 
 
Q: So it would depend upon 
the -- I don™t know, the -- 
A: Yes, it was an regulation. 
Q: That said it was okay? 

A: That the people are [indecipherable] to receiv
e that, or that, or that
, yeah?  Or they were 
forbidden to have that, that, and that, yeah?  Fo
r example, a woma n was not allowed to wear the 
brassiere. While we in the camp office, we
 had brassieres. Nobody -- nobody bothered, yeah. 
Q: And wha t  about underwear?  Panties? 

A: Those who had striped clothese
s, there was -- ther
e were under -- underpant
s, not very -- very 
sexy ones, but there were underpants, and some  ki
nd of an undershirt, and the others, the Jewish 
prisoners, who wore dresses, or whatever, they -- th
ey were allowed to -- to
 wear an -- sweaters, 
under the dress. 

Q: Under the dress?  Not over the dress? 

A: No, because sun -- they had to 
be recognized as prisoners, yeah. 
Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh.  
A: You could wear under -- under the dress, 
anything you wanted. Underwear, you organized. 
They were stealing. They were -- I some times ask 
some girls from the clothing barrack to get me 
some  panties, a dozen or so. So I took th
e whole dozen on my body, went to an barrack, 
undressed myself, supplied that among 
the people, and returned without.  
Q: What about gloves? Did anybody --
 was anybody able to get gloves? 

A: Yeah. But sometimes they were s -- shri -- 
they were shrinking those gloves, some times an 
real glove looked like was that 
-- like my fist, sma ll, because 
they went through -- through the 
steam cleaning machine, and was shrinking. But in 
some  of the outdoor work -- workplaces, they 
were allowed to wear gloves, and received gloves. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
138 
 
Q: Socks? 
A: Gloves. 

Q: Yeah, how about socks? 

A: Yeah. Pardon, socks? 

Q: Socks. 

A: Nobody cared, yeah, if you wore socks, or if you 
had rags. Soldiers wear rags too, so it was 
not officially supplied, yeah, but
 some how they couldn™t care less. Everybody looked after them 
-- after herself and people some how
 had what -- what they -- some  of them had no chance to 
protect themselves in wintertime, 
they fr-frozen toes. Some  of the 
girls had frozen nipples. It™s a 
pity that you don™t speak German. I have here some good literature of -- of -- of interviews. I 

have here some  interviews of people who are de
scribing their pro-problems
 at wintertime, yeah. 
Q: We ll, ma ybe you can tell me  the reference, and 
I can have it translated. So -- before I leave. 
A: Yeah. I ma y give you an copy of an -- of
 one paper where -- no, [i
ndecipherable] it™s a -- 
references, no, it™s enough if I tell yo
u that the girls had frozen nipples. 
Q: So what did they do about it? 

A: They were comi ng to me , and -- and as I have 
learned from one of the doctors, that cod liver 
oil is very good for frozen -- frozen parts of 
the body, and -- and frozen nipples. I collected cod 
liver oil every day from the garb
age heap of the -- of the [indeci
pherable]. There was no garbage 
heap, but the package room, where the non-Jewish 
prisoners re -- would receive packages from 
home , were opened before they were supplied to th
e -- to the owner, and th
ey have taken out all 
the vitami ns. Every package at least contained 
an bottle of cod liver oil from home, because it 
was so good, and important. But the SS removed from each package, the cod liver oil, and the 

vitami ns, and throwing that out in front of the 
barrack, and in the morn
ing -- early morning, the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
139 
 
cleaners, they are comi ng, collecting that, and into 
the garbage. Now whe n I 
have learned that, as 
the package room was next to our barrack, the pa
ckage barrack was numb er five, I was living on 
number four, I went out every mo
rning, and collected all the cod liv
er oil, not the vitami ns, but I 
took all the cod liver oils into my camp office. I 
re -- consumed every day, one bottle of cod liver 
oil. I was st inking. From miles away you could 
feel that some body who was -- who was smelling 
after cod live r oil, but I think it saved my life. It
 saved a lot, because if -- to have in your body, 
every day, an bottle of cod liver oil, meant some thing, yeah. 
Q: What does it do? 

A: Huh?  

Q: What does -- 

A: Drinking, drinking. 

Q: No, no, no, what does it do to -- for you? 

A: Cod liver oil? 
Q: I know I took it as a kid, but -- 
A: Good, then go into the library and read. 

Q: And find out. 

A: Read what it does. But, besides that, I dra
nk -- I was drinking daily one bottle of cod liver oil 
for months, ma ybe a whole year. Then, I supplied 
the hospital, my doctor friends, with cod liver 
oil, so that when patients were comi ng they coul
d treat them, and friends of mi ne who had frozen 

nipples and toes, I supplied them with cod liv
er oil so that they can treat themselves. 
Q: And rubbing -- 

A: Right. 

Q: -- cod liver oil helps. Really? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
140 
 
A: Yeah. If so -- if it was not overdue , becauseso me times the toes were falling off, yeah. But 
everybody noticed an frozen nipple, so most of 
the girls were comi ng, and I supplied them with 
cod liver oil, okay?  
That™s an story, too. 
Q: Yeah, absolutely. 

A: Huh?  

Q: Absolutely. Tell me  about shoes. 

A: Yeah. Huh? 

Q: Who got wooden shoes, and who got norma l s
hoes?  O-Other kinds of shoes, I shouldn™t say 
normal shoes. 

A: All the workers got wooden shoes. 

Q: Outside workers? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Got wooden shoes? 
A: Yeah. And inside workers got good shoes, not
 -- you see, the cont --
 the whole system was 
not designed for the well be
ing of the inma tes, yeah? 
Q: Right. 
A: And sometimes you had big shoes, and sometimes you had small shoes, so it was a mite -- 

nightma re, the shoe business. I, for example, c
ould not get boots. And people were allowed to 
wear boots at wintertime, and I couldn™t ge
t boots, do you know why?  Because most wome n 
were taller than I, and the size 
of the boot was too high. It was h
itting my knees. So I never -- I 
never, never, during all those years, I™ve been
 able to get a pair of
 boots to fit my legs. 
Q: And wha t  happened to those sh-shoes, 
those hiking shoes that you came in with? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
141 
 
A: No, th-then when the summer was comi ng, ye a
h, it was too hot, and th
en I had a better job 
already, I couldn™t walk ar
ound with those shoes, you know, in the camp office. 
Q: Not even in the wint er? 

A: The first. 

Q: The first one? 

A: The first winter, yeah.  

Q: And after that, what did you wear? 

A: Shoes. 

Q: Just regular shoes. 

A: I could any -- any pair of shoes in the -- 
shoe in the clothing barrack. I just se -- 
Q: But if you went outside during the winter
, when there was a lot of snow, it was -- 
A: Well then, I had my -- my boot. 

Q: Then you had your other ones? 
A: Yeah.  
Q: I see. So you kept them the whole time? 

A: As long as I could. 

Q: Right. So that was lucky, because -- 

A: Very. 

Q: -- you couldn™t get other -- 

A: Very, very. 

Q: -- boots, yeah.  

A: And for my size, yeah. I never had an -- wh
at are you calling in E
nglish?  You get s-some  
hardening -- the hardening -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
142 
 
Q: Corns? 
A: Corns, yeah. 

Q: Right. 

A: I never had a corn in my whole life. 

Q: Really? How interesting. 

A: Never had a corn. Because I have always 
taken care of my  shoes, which I wore, yeah. 
Q: But shoes were really crucial in Auschwitz, weren™t they? So it could kill you, or  not. 

A: They are as crucial in New Yo
rk as in Auschwitz, believe me . 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: What do you think, why have they developed afte
r so ma ny years, that kind of walking shoes 
people wear, even with fur coats, yeah?  By 
the way, I had -- I developed one bunion, several 
years ago. Now, that has nothing to do with 
Auschwitz, what I™m telling you. And a bunion is no 
fun, and mo st people mu st undergo surgery becaus
e it hurts. I have decided not to undergo 
surgery, and I have decided no ma tter how expensive,
 and how pretty the shoe is, I have cut out 
an hole on each pair of shoes, where the bunion 
grew. And if you are looking today my -- at my 
li -- leg, I have no bunion any more.  

Q: It just went away? 

A: It just went away, because norma lly, if you have the pressure -- 

Q: It keeps it going. 

A: And I -- people were laughing at
 me . Here, in New York. I was 
well dressed, beautiful shoes, 
and the cut up -- and the hole, 
and I couldn™t care less, yea
h. And it was a good decision. I™ll 
show you.  

Q: Let™s see. No bunions. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
143 
 
A: Huh?  
Q: No bunions, no corns. 

A: Okay, you have learned some thing now. 

Q: Yes, yes. 

A: It™s worthwhile to ruin your 
shoes, than to ruin your leg. 
Q: Absolutely. I agree with you. 

A: And just an ordinary litt
le hole, and if it™s too little
, then you can ma ke it bigger. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Even if the whole bunion come s out. If you 
have black shoes and 
wear black stockings, 
nobody notice that. 

Q: Okay Sip, let™s talk about washing in 
the latrine, for most
 of the prisoners. 
A: Wa shing and what? 

Q: Going to the bathroom. 
A: Yeah, the latrine -- oh, the famous  latrin
e. Yeah, what would you like to know about the 
fa mous latrine? 
Q: People are out on roll call. Do th
ey -- are they allowed to go to the latrine before roll call -- 
A: No, you can™t  -- 

Q: You go right there? 

A: [indecipherable] you don™t go right there. A
nd nobody was allowed to leave the roll call, for 
heaven™s sake. 

Q: No, no, no, I don™t mean that. 

A: No, no. 

Q: When we re people allowed to go to the la
trine?  After roll call, before roll call? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
144 
 
A: N-Not during. 
Q: Not -- no, I understand not during. Before? 

A: It depends. Before, or after, but not during, yeah. During roll calls
 you had to be there. 
Q: Right. 

A: And nobody bothered if y -- it™s 
after or before. If the rollcall was announced, people had to 
gather. And if the roll call was terminat
ed by a mi ssile, people could disperse. 
Q: And they could go to the 
latrine if they wanted to. 
A: They -- they -- yeah. If it wasn
™t too late in the morning, that 
they had the formation of work 
details and so on, yeah. But if it was an urgent ma tter, you had to go. 

Q: Sippy, ordinarily, what time  
is roll call in the morning? 

A: The -- very early. 

Q: I know that it cha -- I know that it changed over time. 

A: Very early, very early. It was still dark, y
eah. So, it winter time, when is it dark? Still -- 
Q: Six, seven? 

A: Roll call started, ac
tually, the waking up -- 
I couldn™t tell you exactly
 the time , but it was 
around five o™clock. And until you -- 
six o™clock, I think, you had to s -- wait until the SS man 
was comi ng and counting you. 

Q: So did you wait outside until they came and counted you? 

A: Sure. 

Q: Yes.  

A: We  had -- Katya, during our time, when we tr
ied to ma ke life easier for the people, under all 
circumstances, on an rainy day, on an windy day, or
 on bad day, we allowe d the people to had -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
145 
 
I mean, we a rranged to allow some  of the people, 
where applicable, to stay indoors, yeah, and to 
be counted indoors, yeah. 
Q: Indoors. 

A: If I say applicable, if th
ere was no room for such an 
usual amount of [i ndecipherable] 
thousand, because there was no space. 

Q: Right. 

A: So, it was always close to the barrack, where th
ey were protected from the weather, and from 
the sun, or so. But, usually it took place outdoors, b
ecause th -- if it was to
o heavy, an heavy rain, 
the SS didn™t wanted to get wet, either. So it was never done for the inma tes -- I me an, they 

would never allow that for the benefit of the in
ma tes, but for their own benefit. And we have 
used that, yeah.  

Q: Right. 

A: We  have used that, by talking 
them into indoor 
-- indoor counting. 
Q: The tape is now stopping again. This 
is the end of tape number five, side B 
End of Tape Five, Side B 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
146 
 
Beginning of Tape Six, Side A 
Q: One second. This is tape number six, United 
States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview 
with Helen Tichauer, on September eighth, 2000.  
A: Blah, blah. 

Q: Blah, blah. Could -- could wome n go to the 
latrine at night?  Because many people talked 
about -- 

A: No, no, no. 

Q: -- ther e being a bucket in the -- in the barr ack. 

A: No, there was curfew, curfew, curfew. 

Q: And curfew started when? 

A: Late. Around 10, I think. But I couldn™t tell y
ou that exactly, we had no watches. Whenever 
they decided curfew, there were whistle -- whistles -- the whistles went  on, and there was 

curfew, and then you were not allowe d to leav
e, otherwise you could have been shot.  
Q: And before curfew, could you go to the latrine? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: If -- you could. 

A: Hm?  

Q: You could? 

A: You could. 

Q: Did most of the latrines also
 have washing facilities, or not? 
A: Some of them had a little bit --
 a little bit, but not 
really. It depend where. In Birkenau the la -
- la -- the wooden barracks -- 
yeah, the wooden barracks had buc
kets. The brick barracks had 
buckets, too. The latrines were actually real 
buildings, wooden buildings
, or brick buildings, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
147 
 
behind the whole row in the -- in the wome n™s 
camp. Beho -- behind the row of brick barracks, 
there were barracks who -- in -- were
 in use for -- for the 
latrine. We  have -- they are still in good 
shape today, they still exist. 
You can see for those if you go to Birkenau, you can see how the 
latrines looked. There we re holes -- 

Q: Right, right. 

A: -- where you were sitting, and doing your
 business. It was an ugly business. 

Q: Why?  

A: Very ugly. 

Q: Want to explain that? 

A: Uh?  

Q: You want to explain? Why was it ugly? 

A: Oh, to sit there, and to be
 pushed around sometimes, be -- ther
e were more people than holes.  
Q: Is that where you went, or did you 
have a -- was there a latrine that -- 
A: I went on the barrack -- on the bucket, but
 in the beginning I wa
s living there, too. 
Q: Did you have diarrhea? 

A: And I had diarrhea. And I don™t 
even want to 
think about it. 
Q: It™s awful. 

A: Horrible. Bloody diarrhea, no me dication, dirt
y, couldn™t clean yourself. Wa it -- wait until the 
next morning, you had an bit of tea, and then you 
had to use that to clean yourself, and to wash 
your tookas. It™s ho
rrible, horrible. 
Q: So to -- h-how does -- I know when, in or
dinary circumstances, norma l circumstances -- 
A: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
148 
 
Q: -- when you get diarrhea, it
™s very difficult. You have to
 make sure that you don™t get 
dehydrated, it™s exhausting. 
A: Who -- who could think about dehydr
ation?  We had nothing to drink. 
Q: Right. 

A: Because the water we™ve -- they™ve supplied us, 
that caused the diarrhea
, was infected water. 
So th-that, you cannot imagine, 
it was -- was like an vicious circle
. If -- I really don™t know how 
everything work -- how I -- how I overcame all thos
e things. Hard to believe. You see, diarrhea 
is some thing unpleasant, even here, when you have
 all the facilities, le
t alone where you had no 
facilities whatsoever to clean yourself, or to -- 
to -- to use an toilet whenever you had the urge, 
yeah. And there was not diarrhea only, as you ha
d some  -- always two or three different 
conditions. I don™t know how we did it, I really
 don™t know. I tell you what I did, during the 
heavy time, and hard time, some how I got myself 
a tin -- a tin, and whenever I had the urge to do 
some thing during the night, I used the tin. Then -- 
put that in front of my legs, in that bed where 
we were laying, but some of the wo
me n used their -- their eating -- 

Q: Bowls?  

A: Bowls for both, and that was an bi g tragedy, b
ecause they never -- they couldn™t survive. You 
see, you -- you infected yourself
, and re-infected yourself. You 
couldn™t -- and no ma tter what 
we did to explain not to do that
, it didn™t help. So, I can tell you 
what I did, but I can not ec -- 
explain why the others used only th-the same  bowl
 for their business they used for eating. I never 
did it. I got -- got myself a can of -- it was a
pproxima tely as -- ama -- an two pound can, tall like 
that. Wa s just good to use as a -- for urinating. Also, I never had to go down when -- I like to live 

always on the top, where most 
people didn™t wanted to climb, cause they had no -- no energy. I 
could always climb, I was always on the top, and 
there used my -- my -- a
nd then all I had to go 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
149 
 
was going down in the morning, and s -- and empty th
at into the bucket. And then I left the can 
again on my  bed, and -- and the block personnel, 
who checked those beds, and some times even 
arranged the beds, they never -- never throw thos
e cans out. They knew what it is used for. So 
that is the way how I really survived.  
Q: So -- and -- 

A: How I managed, yeah. 

Q: Right. And other wome n did si
milar things, as far as you know? 
A: Some  of them, probably, yes.
 Nobody -- there was no consitent -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- to tell you what to do, yeah? 

Q: Right, right. 

A: You acted on your own instinct, and own judge
me nt. The r e you were really alone. What are 

you doing?  
Q: I was just checking. 
A: Oh. 

Q: Tell me  about the bedding, the ma ttr -- 

A: About what? 

Q: The mattress, the -- what pe
ople s -- what people slept on. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Did most people have some  hay, or
 whatever it was, what was it? 
A: No, no, no, we had mattresses with straw. 

Q: Mattresses with straw. 

A: Oh yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
150 
 
Q: So they were covered?  The -- th
e straw was covered by some  ma terial? 
A: Yeah, yeah, in -- yeah. It -- ma ttresse
s -- I mean, it was not a mattress like -- 
Q: Yeah. 
A: -- you go out and buy a mattress, but it was an 
-- kind of an pillow k -- a large pillow cover, 
yeah, with an hole in the center, where you stu
ffed in straw. So it was covered, and protected, 
yeah, and then we were sleeping on that. 

Q: And how was -- how was that -- did all the bu
nks have that already, or did people have to 
bring it when they -- 

A: No, no, no, the bunks had the wooden -- wooden 
bottom, and the blockelteste, and the block 
personnel, had to get those from an s pecial unit,
 who supplied ma ttresses, and the straw, yeah. 
They -- that had to be carried from
 an special unit, into the block. 
Q: Uh-huh. And how long did 
they -- one ma ttress --  

A: Forever. 
Q: You just -- that was it? 
A: All the time. 

Q: It was all the time , they didn™t change those? 

A: No. 

Q: So after awhile, because of -- 

A: They were thrown out, and I -- they were ye
 -- probably full of urine, or who knows what. 
Q: Yeah, yeah. 

A: After awhile, but it took awhile. 

Q: Pretty un -- 

A: But -- huh? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
151 
 
Q: Go ahead. 
A: Again, you had to s -- you had to ask for it,
 and then you had -- you were supplied with -- you 
have -- or they arranged the supply of 
any request from ti me  to time, yeah. 
Q: And in the beginning, did you sleep alone on 
the -- on the bunk, or did you 
have two, or three, 
or four people? 

A: 15. 

Q: 15 on one? 

A: On -- on one bunk, yeah. 

Q: 15?   

A: 15. 

Q: Short people? 

A: You me a n -- which bunks? 

Q: We ll, when you first came into Auschwitz one -- 
A: Ah, Auschwitz one, we were on the floor.  
Q: Right. 

A: Then we were in wooden beds, there were no bunks.  

Q: Okay. Wooden beds? 

A: In vi -- wooden beds, thos
e t-t-tri -- t-three bunk -- 
Q: Yeah, bunk beds. 

A: Bunk bed, ah. There were 
always two people in one. 
Q: So did you s -- 

A: We  were never alone, never alone. 

Q: So did you sleep head to foot?   

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
152 
 
A: Yeah. 
Q: One person™s head on one side, and -- 

A: Foot -- foot -- foot and head. 

Q: Yeah. And when you went -- 

A: And if you were more on the loving side, and 
you had your lover, then 
were sleeping the way 
you wanted, right? 

Q: Uh-uh. 

A: But normally people sl ept so th
at we could accommodate ourselves. 
Q: And were there a lot of relations
hips that were closer than -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: There were? 

A: As -- it wa s actually introduced by -- in the be
ginning, not amongst the Jewish girls, but in the 

beginning, where we had so many German from
 Ravensbrück, the first thousand, you had ma ny 
who were there for years, in Ravensbrück, a
nd they have developed some  relationship among 
themselves, and those who had no partners, we
re looking -- seeking for partners amongst the 
Jewish women. And Jewish wome n were introdu
ced to lesbianism, as German women from 
Ravensbrück. They didn™t know 
one thing, they didn™t know the 
difference, they didn™t know 
anything, yeah. So, it was very hard
 to distinguish who is really 
a partner or not. But people were 
looking for love, and warmth, and 
companionship. They™re lonely. 
Q: Wa s that helpful to people, you think? 

A: I don™t know. I have never experienced anythi
ng, because I had friends from home, from the 
youth move me nt and so on, so we were used to li
ve together in the summer camps, and so on. So 
there was no lack of -- lack of
 -- we were not lonely, yeah. Girls from school, neighbors, we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
153 
 
always were seeking for some  old relationship 
from home . We were young 
then, and sports -- 
from the sports club, or so on. So it -- it -- if
 is me , I had no -- I personally had no problems, I 
always had company, and that was good enough.  
Q: Wh- Whe n you think about the ma jority of wo
me n that you knew, not just -- not just your 
close friends, but people that you saw. 

A: Yeah? 

Q: Did they tend to have a relationship with 
one person, or two people 
-- no -- including people 
who became lovers, but was that more typi cal? 

A: [indecipherable] it -- look, the -- the problem
 among the people was -- was a language, yeah?  
It™s not enough just to be at
tracted by a body, right?  In thos
e days, we needed communication. 
You had to learn how to survive,
 you had to learn ma ny things, a
nd that couldn™t be done without 
an verbal communication. So, people who kne
w the language, the German wome n, spoke 
German. Our wome n, fr om Slovakia in the be
ginning, spoke enough Germ
an to communicate. 
They were -- but we were ma inly looking for th
e companionship of poli
tical prisoners, because 
those who were professional prostitu
tes, were not very attractive 
to us, they were different, was 
an different -- different cate
gory of people. And the politic
al prisoners had their own 
companionship with -- since Ravensbrück, w
ho -- there were couples who were already 
established couples. And those who had no partne
r were not even seek
ing for any partner, 
because they had their husbands at ho me , or in 
-- during the war, somewhere on the front, or they 

were old, and were never ma rried, and had no -- di
dn™t know what it means to have a partner at 
all, yeah, spinsters, who were -- but they were
 decent people who were 
idealists, because that  
was the reason why they were put into the camp 
as Socialists or Communi sts. So, I my self  
always looked for good people. I had an good frie
nd who was the wife of an -- she was German, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
154 
 
but had an Jewish husband, and two sons at home.
 And she practiced, more or less, medicine. 
We had such different ailments, like in civili
an life, all of a sudden, everybody -- mo st of the 
wome n -- at least I, among others, we  were lot 
an -- pus in my whole mo uth, yeah. Be tween the 
teeth, the tongue, everything. I couldn
™t talk, I couldn™t swallow, I 
couldn™t do nothing. It was an 
awful situation. I don™t know where from, how 
she got it, she was comi ng every day with 
some thing. And I had to keep that
 in my mouth for awh
ile, and then spit it out, and she cured me , 
yeah. Because she knew from experience, what to do under the camp conditions. Havi ng her 
husband to probably practice me dicine there an di
fferent way, but I had an woma n wha t  -- during 
my ma laria attacks, who was 
an Jehovah Witness, who brought -- and worked in the SS 
pharmacy. They were stealing every 
day, one tablet of shineen, yeah. 
Q: What is shineen? 

A: Shineena. That is the me dication if you ha
ve ma laria. Shining, hining, shining, how do you 
pronounce it?  C-h-i-n-i-n-e. Good? 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: So, I had a pool of helpers help us, yeah?  Of
 good people, and I would 
not s -- would not deal 
with -- with the rough or low -- low grade -- lo
w grade morally, low grade people. I -- I was 
selective, and that was my luck, yeah. Could sp
eak the language, and it was my luck that I was 
selective. And so -- but nobody approached me , ever. 

Q: But -- 

A: I was an ugly -- must have been
 very ugly with my short hair. 
Q: Sippy, I reme mber -- 

A: Yeah? 

Q: -- when -- when Irwin was alive -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
155 
 
A: Yeah? 
Q: -- and talked to me  about this when we -- whenwe all would talk about it.
 And he said that -- 
and it wa -- I™m not now talking ab
out lesbian relationships, but -- 
A: Mm-h m.  

Q: -- he said that me n did not pair bond, and wome n tended to pair bond. Insofar as you know, is 

that the case, that wome n tended, wh
ether they were 
lovers or not -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- to be with one other person, very close? 

A: You always had an camp sister. 

Q: Yeah?  You always had a camp sist -- 

A: If nothing, always. Why?  It 
was practical, more practical to 
have two rations together to 
share, than to have only one ration, yeah. You 
could ma nipulate, if you had two pieces of bread, 
two rations, and two pieces or ma rgarine, yeah, 
you could go and use together only one ration of 
ma rgarine together. Li mi t yourself. And one ration
 of bread, but exchange the other half for 
some thing which was more important than the 
ration, yeah?  And I was never in the exchange 
business, but n -- I had a partner,
 a very religious gi
rl, whom I found there in the camp office. I 
have known her brothe r at home, and because of
 that she was more attracted -- I was more 
attracted to her, and she trusted me . With her 
I was even sleeping together in one bed. She 
became my partner, butvery relig
ious. And she™s still alive, sh
e lives in Jerusa -- in the -- 
Jerusalem. She was a business wome n. She went out and exchanged some times, she returned 
with some  garlic, or with an onion, yeah, what th
e girls were smuggling in from the field where -

- where they had to perfor m. Now, I knew that th
at is important, more i mportant  than a piece of 
bread, so if we were eating garlic, and onions wi
th ma rgarine on bread. Ev
en if only half of it 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
156 
 
wat -- the vitami ns were more important than the 
starch, yeah? So that was an relationship where 
she was a businesswoma n, she supplied me  with 
all the goodies, and -- but she became my -- my 
ca -- then later on, I became  to shabbas goy, it wa
s Pesach, and she wouldn™t eat bread, so we 
had to exchange the bread against potatoes. A
nd we had to cook the potatoes illegally. I had 
already my drawing office, I had an stove, yeah. 
So I cooked inside of th
e stove, because outside 
we were not allowed to sh -- to cook. And that  was an relationship of eating together, and do-
doing business together, and most girls v -- ea
t -- nobody was eating alone, 
that -- I can tell you 

that. Th-That was an -- an habit, to have an part
ner with to eat, yeah, 
together. So, I don™t know 
if the me n did it. Irwin must have known 
better. I never spoke with him about it. 
Q: He said no. 

A: Huh?  

Q: He said no. 

A: He said no. But ma ybe in his experience. 
Q: You™re right. It-It™s hard -- it
™s hard to -- to generalize with so ma ny t housands of people. 
A: Yeah, but that was -- had nothing to do 
with love, or with lesbianism, or -- 
Q: Right. 
A: It was just a necessity of going to an restaurant, you™d rather sit with some body and eat 

together, than to be alone 
in an corner. Right, or not? 
Q: Yeah, sure. 

A: Sa me , I mean we were human, the same  feelings, the same  instinct. 

Q: But it --  it -- it -- 

A: Among wome n, it was more i mportant, no? 

Q: Perhaps, than for the men. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
157 
 
A: Yeah. I can -- have never experien -- some times you had only one -- one -- what™s his name ?  
Bowl. So you were forced to eattwo people out of one bowl, yeah. 

Q: One bowl. 

A: If they like it or not. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: And we™re entitled to two bowls
 of soup, so once they™ve finished
 the first, they could collect 
the second, but they were forced to eat together
, or they had only one 
spoon, or -- look, they 
were [indecipherable] funny circumstances, which drove
 you into -- into toge
ther in, yeah. It was 
not the -- the me n probably had their own bowl,
 and could eat their own soup by themselves, 
yeah. 

Q: And why would that be th
e case? Was the s -- was the ci
rcumstances in the men™s camp 
different -- 

A: Yeah. 
Q: -- and better than the wome
n™s?  Physical circumstances. 
A: It depend -- Irwin was never in Birkenau. 
Q: Right. 

A: Yeah. So, c-call mi ne was different, and in
 Auschwitz, he was better off than anybody in 
Birkenau, and still he described in his book hi
s -- the camaraderie between an couple of me n, 
among the mselves, how they ma nage. That is 
an good book he wrote, yeah. But noth -- n-no 
mystery, and no I -- I -- I,
 yeah?  It™s very well done. I will
 give you one book to carry with you, 
because whenever you will ha ve a chance to have some body who speaks German, it will be 

helpful to translate you an little bit -- 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
158 
 
A: -- step by step, bit by bit,
 yeah. Do you think I™m right? 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Good. Now, what else please? 

Q: I™m just trying to think if there™ s --  

A: It -- does that answer what
 you -- your question about the camar
aderie?  The shortage of bowls 
-- bowls, or bowels? 

Q: Bowls. 

A: Bowls?  

Q: Yes, bowels are different. 

A: Okay, b-o -- b-o-w-l, yeah? 

Q: Yes.  

A: And bowel is? 

Q: B-o-w-e-l. 
A: E-l?  Uh huh. 
Q: Right, right. 

A: Bowel movement. 

Q: Right, so it™s different, yeah. 

A: Good, now I know. 

Q: But Sippy, let me  ask you some thing. If you ha
ve among the wome n, ha -- ma inly pairs -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q :  - -  s o me t i me s  i t  ma y  b e
 three or four -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- but ma inly it was two people. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
159 
 
A: Yeah. 
Q: What did that mean between those two peopl
e, and another two people?  Wa s there -- di -- 
were there circumstances where there were a lo
t of difficulties in a ba
rrack between gr oups of 
people, either groups of different nationalities
, or -- no. But everybody wasn™t ni ce to each other? 
A: Everybody wasn™t what? 

Q: Nice. It was a difficult circumstance, so
 people have complicated wa ys of -- 
A: Look, the people amongst themselves in the barr
ack, if th-they were living in an barrack, and 
worked in the same  work detail, yeah, are so ti
red at the evening, and we
re so busy to look after 
their own business. That means eating, and sleep
ing, yeah. There was no time for being nice or 
not nice. You will have today among people in
 good conditions living, neighbors are fighting 
neighbors, yeah. It™s huma n. Some  
people, they™re fighti
ng with their mouths, yeah. Fist fights, 
nobody wanted to lose any energy. So it™s ha rmless 
if you scream at each other. I don™t even 

consider that as not nice, just human to let it ou
t. And I really don™t know -- 
or don™t think that to 
ma ke an big issue out of it. People were very te
nse, or weak, or tired, or sleepy, or hungry. So 
someti mes they screame d at each ot her, and screaming is harmless. I don™t think that screaming 

is a crime. Not even if the bloc
kelteste were scre -- the blockeltestes were screaming. To -- to 
judge blockelteste and other screaming  personne
l, f -- only for one reason that they were 
screaming, is not justified. 

Q: Sippy, you not only didn™t have wa tche
s, you didn™t have calendars, right? 
A: Uh-huh, yeah. 

Q: So how -- if people we re relig
ious, whether they were Christia
n, or they were Jewish, how did 
they find out, and how did they respond to th
e various holidays, as far as you reme mbe r? 
A: First of all, newcomers br
ought in the news of the day -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
160 
 
Q: I see. 
A: -- and events.  

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Some  had contact through the camp office. On
e person only, she wer -- was able to discover 
the date, or the -- yeah, that spreads very qui
ckly. There was the latr
ines, where people have 
communicated, even if they have known each other. That was no problem. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: That was no problem. [indecipherable] 

Q: So the people tried 
to celebrate holidays? 
A: Oh yeah. 

Q: Did you? 

A: No. 

Q: No. No holidays, didn™t ma tter? 
A: My religious girl, sh
e -- she knew everything. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: She had the calendar, we had in the 
camp office a day, and everything. There were 
newcomers who brought exactly the -- all news in, 
and cross -- cross we -- we could cross check, 
or they could cross check the Jewish holidays. 
But it had no -- no significance for me  personally, 
because to be  in a place like that, it -- it coul d 
have become schizophrenic, to be in the hell, and 
to -- and to sing like in heaven, yeah. 

Q: And -- and you -- this re
ligious -- this woma n who 
was your -- your partner -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- who was religious, what 
did she do about being kosher? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
161 
 
A: Kosher?  She was not eati
ng anyth -- any sausage -- 
Q: Really? 
A: -- when we had -- when we had the rations. 
I gaved her my cheese, and she gave me  her 
sausage. So I ate her sausage t
oo, and she was eating my cheese. 

Q: I see. 

A: And that how we ma naged. Pesach she wa
s not eating any bread, 
but she was living on 
potatoes, and that was it. 

Q: I™m stopping the tape. 
End of Tape Six, Side A 
Beginning Ta pe Six, Side B 
Q: Tape number six, side B, United States Holo
caust Memorial interview with Helen Tichauer, 
September eighth. Sippy, what did runners do? 

A: Who?  
Q: Runners. Like Mala. 
A: Oh, runner. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: There were different types 
of runners. There were even runners, I can show you very nice 
pictures of Indian tribes in the old time s, and 
Indian tribes today, South 
American Indian tribes, 
where people live in the high pl
ateau of the Andean mountains, where they have no other 
communication, like verbal communication between 
one tribe and another, by using individuals, 
the so-called runners, yeah?  They walk from one
 village to another a
nd communicate, or convey 
me ssages, and so on. So the runner business is no
t an invented one of the concentration camp, 
but as we had no vehicles, the ter -- the di
stances between camp 
-- in the camp, betwe en 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
162 
 
barracks, were pretty large. Bicycles were not 
used for -- for -- inmates 
couldn™t u -- did not have 
any bicycles, only the SS, some  of them were able
 to use bicycles. The SS runners actually had 
bicycles. An runner is some body who conveys messa
ges, or who has an job to do, to do it fr -- 
[indecipherable] from one point to
 another, and ha -- with a ce
rtain order to do some thing, to 
bring some  people from one barrack to -- to anothe
r, to -- to the front entrance for any reason, or 
to -- is a me ssenger service, more or less. Now,
 there were no -- no other way of communication, 
no-not even telephones, yeah. They have us
ed people who were me ssengers, yeah. So, 
some ti me s they had dual -- an dual duty. Some times they we re runners who were sent from one -
- from the main e -- from the camp office, for ex
ample, to an barrack, and convey an me ssage or 
ask the bl ockelteste to co me to the camp offi
ce, or some  si milar orders were given from 
headquarters, from the t-top ma nageme nt to us, 
and we had to execute 
that through the runners, 
yeah. Through those people who are sending th
em through different barracks, or different 
facilities to -- to convey an certa
in order, or me ssage, or whatever. And   they work mainly in 
couples. Wh en the one couldn™t do it, then the ot
her took over, yeah, or when one was on lunch 
break, or in the toilet, and some thing has to be 
done in a hurry, the other took over. They were 
couples molis. But then you had an other function 
of certain runners, who 
ma de an -- had an du-
dual function. They were multi-lingual, and coul d be used as transl at ors. So, such, for example, 

was Mala, wa s an runner, and an translator betw
een German a nd French, and German and I think 
Polish, she could speak Polish. 

Q: That™s Mala Zeemadbel. 

A: Zeema, yeah. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
163 
 
A: Then you had another runner, which was -- an
d an translator, which was not one to be 
identified, but I know where -- her name , and I know where she lives. Her ma iden name  then 
was Ava Pome ranz. She was an -- an -- one of
 those runners who t
ook, like Mala, and ma ny 
others, who were taking some ti me s people from th
e camp offi ce, who were asked to report to our 
camp office, and were then taken for -- with t
hose runners, and an SS ma n, over to the Gestapo 
for interrogation, yeah. That was one of the ac
tivities, too, to accomp
any c e rtain people who 
have to appear at the SS headqua
rters in the shtopskaboida for interrogation. That was ma  -- one 
of the main activities of
 the shtopskaboida of personnel, SS with their secretaries. Now, there 
was Mala, there was Ava Pome ranz, and so on. So, there are some  still alive, and I know where 

they are, and I even ma de myse
lf a list of all the runners. So
, it was an important activity, 
because without telephone, and without vehicles, 
and with such an big enterprise was -- there 
was so ma ny move me nts going -- so ma ny things 
going on, that they had that -- that it was a 
me ssenger service among others, yeah. 
Q: So -- so at any one time, about
 how ma ny runners would there be? 
A: Oh. 
Q: You think? 

A: Wa it a minute, [indecipherable] and 
two, four, six -- I would say a dozen. 
Q: Mm-hm, and where were they living?  
We re there -- was there a particul ar -- 
A: As a -- in the individual barracks, or th-the
y were not living in priv
ate rooms, just located 
close to -- in -- they were
 living in -- in barracks, just like anybody else. 
Q: Did they have -- did they have a partic
ular insignia on their 
arm or something -- 
A: Yeah, sure. 

Q: -- to -- so that -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
164 
 
A: Yeah, sure. 
Q: -- she was -- they were clear that  th -- 

A: You must realize that the la -- if it comes to
 insignias on the arms, there were the ar -- the arm 
bins, yeah? 

Q: Ar m bands? 

A: Bands, yeah. The la -- you had n-n-nearly ev
ery function was ma rked, yeah, in the camp. The 
blockelteste, the block ad
mi nistrator, the lagerelteste, the ra
pport schreiber, the -- every runner. 
Many, ma ny people were ma rked so that you 
could recognize who they are. And at the 
workplace, the same  thing. You had the kapos, the sub-kapos, the foreme n, and ma ny other 

functions in the wor -- at the wor
kplace, were still -- were ma rked 
just the same. So that wasn™t 
my job to do just the same , 
I did all those -- those arm -- 

Q: Ar m -- arm bands? 

A: Correct, so I -- as you can s
ee, I had an important job, yeah? 
Q: So what sort of an insignia di
d the runner have?  What did it say? 
A: Runner, it was -- 

Q: It said runner. And wh
at is that in German? 
A: [indecipherable] loifa. 

Q: Loifa. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: And did they -- were they considered priv
ileged in some  way?  We re they not in -- 
A: They were privileged, yeah of course, they
 had an job where they could enter any building, 
where they could run, or be outdoors any time of 
the day, even if there was curfew during an 
selection. That -- that was it. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
165 
 
Q: So do you think that some  of these people actua
lly ended up being in touc
h with the resistance 
because they could then bring me ssages, or was that -- 
A: They ended up like what? 

Q: Were some of these women -- 

A: Yeah? 

Q: -- I don™t know about the me n, I™m 
assumi ng the me n had runners, too. 
A: Yeah, good, of course. 

Q: Do you think they we re -- some  of them were 
in contact with the resist
ance, because then they 
could -- 

A: With who m? 

Q: Resistance. 

A: Oh. I cannot answer that. 

Q: But it would be an opportunity, right, becau
se you could br ing me ssages?  They could bring 
more than just the -- 

A: Because you have an idea, do you think 
the SS wouldn™t have had the same  idea? 
Q: Of course they™d have the same  idea. That doesn™t mean it wouldn™t happen. 

A: So, you had -- you had -- you were very careful, because you see, if you -- everybody was 

careful with those people, you never 
know for whom they are running, yeah? 
Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh, right. No ma tter which side, yes. 

A: People in the resist
ance were not visible. 
Q: Right. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Right. Of course. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
166 
 
A: If todays -- ev -- anybody who™s telling you 
the story, resistance [inde
cipherable], they were 
invisible people. 
Q: But some body was in it. 

A: But they were not visible. 

Q: Right, right. And do you not trust the people w
ho™ve talked afterwards
 about being in the 
r e si st ance?  

A: Everybody™s telling you now he was in the resi
stance, now what kind 
of business is that? 
Q: Tell me  about Mala Zeemadbel, what kind of a person she was. 

A: Selfish, stupid girl. 

Q: Selfish, stupid girl. 

A: Show-off, big mouth. She had her own contact
 reels, yeah, the Belgian Je wesses, and she 
could help, because she could come  into our o
ffice, and ask for favors any time, and she was 
[indecipherable] yeah. Any time, she -- she had 
to go through us. And if 
she needed some thing, 
she could come  and ask for a favor. But what we are talk -- ma king out of her, it™s nonsense. If 

she wouldn™t have been stupid, sh
e wouldn™t have planned -- or 
she actually didn™t planned her 
escape. If she wouldn™t have been stupid, she w
ouldn™t have done what she did. She had all the 

chances to survive. What was the hurry? 

Q: So why did she do it? Because she™s stupid? 

A: Look, when she arrived, I was then still work
ing -- you know I worked in the -- among others 
as the printer of those numbers -- 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A:  -- fo -- f-for newco mers, yeah? New arri val s . 

Q: Right, right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
167 
 
A: I was there when she arrive
d with an Belgian transport. 
Q: Right. 
A: It was late afternoon, must ha
ve been winter off -- late af
ternoon, but it was dark. So there 
were -- I -- I don™t know how many hundreds newcomer
s and to register them, and to process so 
many, and until they are passing through everything, a
nd finally got their numbered labels, and -- 
sewn on, they were standing in one corner, andwa iting until the whole group was processed, and 

after that , the blockelteste, for whom they were
 designated to be transferred, was comi ng, and 
took them to their barracks -- to the barracks. 
And that what happened with that particular 
transpor t when she arrived, where she was in th
e Belgian transport. I 
was sitting there, and 
watching, and all of a sudden, some body went up on 
a table like that, and giving orders to the 
crabat -- to the whole group. She didn™t know, is she 
crazy?  I went over to her, and I said, ﬁWhat 
are you doing here?  Get down from t he table.ﬂ 
She didn™t understood. I 
said, ﬁGet down. Look, 
you are now in Auschwitz. You are not in Belgiu
m, I don™t want you to show off. The mo ment 
you show off, you™ve -- the SS will reme mber you. Get down off here -- from here. Get off the 

table.ﬂ So, a-after awhile she 
went down. And then the nextdays -- she took over leadership, 
yeah?  Next days, she was presen
ted by the blockelteste as some
body who speaks languages. In 
the arbatz einsatz, yeah. Was in our building, in
 our office, in our [inde
cipherable] my drawing 
office, so she was sent -- given the job as an r
unner. And from the runner, she became translator, 
both. And from there on, she had every day to come in the morning to the camp office, and take 

orders, and what to do, and what
 [indecipherable] she got her 
work order every day, in the 
morning. And that™s the way how I have been wi
th her on an daily basis, and I me t her every 

day, and it was a norma l relationship between me and 
the others. But that ™s the way --  that ™s the 
time when we met for the fi rst time, and when I ju
mped at her to get off, yeah. Because wa -- the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
168 
 
mome nt the SS noticed some body with such qualitie
s, they picked you and ma de -- gave to you 
an big job as an -- as an camp vi -- I don™t 
know what, and it was not very nice to witness 
some body t o be recruited f-for an cruel job, yeah
?  So in any case, that we nt on, on and on. She 
did her job, and she was comi ng every day, and when
 she needed some  favors to help the girls 
from Belgium, she had an easy -- easy approach to 
us, because  we helped her. Now -- then, all of 
a sudden, the day when she escaped, you know that sh
e had ma laria, and she used to have attacks 
from time to time, and we knew that. The day when she escaped, same  day I we -- she was living 

on number six barrack, in the barrack where the 
people from the -- the klidonskcamera, they are 
living. And I went at lunchtime, over to six. Ther
e was Ava, my friend who lives now in Israel, 

whose husband I ma de for -- the sign, yeah. 

Q: What™s her last name ?  Ava? 

A: Valansuela is her name  now. 

Q: Uh-huh, alright. 
A: And I went over with her because I think so
me  of the Poles -- Polish men were coming, and 
wanted to meet with the girls in
 my office, I always vacated my
 office, I d -- I went walking. I 
went over to Ava, to number six. Four, five, six, 
and Ava had a boyfriend, he was visiting her, an 
Dutch boy, so I didn™t wanted to interfere. Then 
I finally noticed the ba
rrack was totally empty, 
but -- because they were worki
ng in the beglidinskammer the w
hole barrack, but there was Mala 
in her bed, and next to her, her boyfriend Edek, 
standing next to her. So
 I thought she had again 
her ma laria attack, yeah. I went over, and went 
to ask her how she is, here was Edek standing, 
she seemed to me quite normal, so she had no 
-- no ma laria attack, so I didn™t wanted to 
interfere. He visited her, okay. Why she was in 
bed, I wi -- don™t know. In
 any case, I left. An 
hour later, the siren went on. That wa s the last 
mo me nt before she escaped, I ma y have been the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
169 
 
last person who ever spoke to her, yeah. Now, s 
-- they were caught, there 
are several stories, but 
it is true that she had a malari a attack during 
her ordeal, and while escaping, and he panicked, 
and went to the village 
doctor. And that was it. 
Q: And the doctor told on them? 
A: Hm?  

Q: The doctor contacted the Germans? 

A: So the rest is history. 

Q: But what™s the -- 

A: Huh?  

Q: -- from -- from your perspective, the diffe
rent stories about what
 happened afterwards. 
A: What stories do you know? 

Q: There -- there stories that she -- when sh
e was going to be hung, she had a razor blade, and 
she had cut herself. 
A: That is true. She had the razor blade from 
Herta -- Herta Rote, who was another lifer, who™s 
dead by now, and she cut herself. 
Q: And this was before they took her to be hung? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: When she was -- 

A: She wasn™t hung. 

Q: She wasn™t hung? 

A: No, no. They wanted to hang her, she cut he
rself. According -- you see, I always avoided 
anything like being present. Ever
ybody had to come  and to witne
ss that, the whole camp. And I 
locked myself up in my drawing office, nobody coul
d see me , that I am there, and I never went 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
170 
 
to the execution, yeah. And so I cannot tell you 
what really happened, but according to the 
others, she cut herself, she was supplied by Herta 
Rote with an razor blade, and Mandel -- see, 
according to the people, she was hitting Mandel w
ith her bl oody hand in her face. Then she was 
ordered -- then -- then th
e Hauptchafuehrer Maul, ordered her to
 carry her into the crematorium, 
where she was shot by him, and that was it. Then
 the father of the -- Edek was brought in from 
an village, was hanged in front of his son, and th
en he was hanged. So that was an badly planned 
escape. That was selfishness. She put so ma ny pe
ople into -- into trouble, 
and lost her life. And 
she could have survived easily, like all us, a
nd could have led a norma l life. She had an 
boyfriend at home  that she abandoned for Ed
ek. I don™t think she was very clever.  
Q: What year was that? When did she -- 

A: Huh?  

Q: What year was that when she escaped? 

A: ™44. 
Q: ™44, and she arri
ved there in ™43? 
A: Ah, wait a mi nute, what are you talking about? 
Q: When did Mala arrive in Auschwitz, do you reme mber? 

A: Arrive? 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Ah, ™40 -- ™43. End -- no, end of ™42. 

Q: End of ™42. 

A: End of ™42. 

Q: And this was the summer of ™44 when she escaped? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
171 
 
A: Escaped, yeah. But I would not like to bri
ng Mala in at all, because everybody writes about 
Mala, Mala, so let™s everybody -- I -- I have --
 I knew her on the first day she arrived. 
Q: Right. 
A: I spoke to her the last  hour before she left, ye
ah?  That is all I rem -- will -- want to reme mber. 
Q: Yeah. Tell me  about Rosa Robbat. What was she like? 

A: A nor ma l girl. Very clever, very shrewd, and 
s -- again, as they had no 
Polish Jewish girls in 
the camp office whatsoever, they had a hard time to
 help each other to get 
-- Polish Jewish girls 
had no good positions because of that. So, there we re
 some  work details which were better. For 
example, the work details, indoor work details
, yeah. Pretty good, and [indecipherable] the 
Polish girls could be accommodate
d. Rosa helped -- tried to help them through me , yeah. She 

ma de contact with me , and whenever she needed
 some thing, she approached me , and I helped 
her. But sh -- I was never recruited by her for 
anything else, yeah. We  ha
d an entire different 
relationship. She knows -- she had what she wanted 
from me, I had what I wanted from her. I -- 
She organized for me  all my underp
anties, and all the ma  -- bowls of -- rolls of ma terial to ma ke, 
quickly, handkerchiefs for your head, to cover 
when newcomers arrived, especially from my 
city, in the lase -- late autum
n, ™44. She brought me  a lot of ma terial when I could go to the 
barrack, and supply the people, they never receive
d -- it was cold, [indecipherabl e]. They never 
received any covers, so there where she helped me
, and she helped me  to steal from the clothing 
barrack, whatever -- whatever I needed, and I he
lped her by placing people, whenever she asked 
me . Then, that™s about it. 

Q: But what about the aprons, didn™t she -- 

A: We ll, shall I tell you the story? 

Q: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
172 
 
A: Did I told you the story already? 
Q: I think you did. I think on the phone on
ce, you told me  some  of it, but I -- 
A: Yeah, she brought me  s -- always a custom tailored aprons, of -- so 
I accepted that, because 
we were -- that was very fashionable in the ca
mp office, to have over your dress a nice apron, 
yeah. 

Q: A regular -- like a kitchen apron? 

A: No, no -- 

Q: No [indecipherable] 

A: -- nicely -- nicely tailored. 

Q: Yes? 

A: Yeah, they were pretty. I ma ybe have to ma ke one to sketch how they look like. And from 

time to time she was coming pretty frequent to 
exchange, bought me  a new one, took the old one. 
And I always begged her, I don™t need more ap
rons, and leave me  the one. ﬁNo, I want you to 
have it.ﬂ So, by now I am -- I was -- and later on, when all that happened, I was suspicious if 

they didn™t -- if she did not use me  as an carrier  of her -- of her -- of her smuggled stuff, because 

I reme mber later on that the aprons had one -- 
were nicely sewn, but at the end, they had 
some thing like that, yeah, two or thre
e seams at -- at the end of the -- 
Q: Yeah. 

A: And it could have been here inside -- 

Q: Side. 

A: -- that she™s -- was hiding stuff, because sh
e supplied those I -- aprons
 to several people who 
were in high positions, yeah, probably knowing th
at nobody™s going to -- to
 check their -- their 
belongings what they wear. And that™s the way 
-- I have never spoke to anybody about it, but 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
173 
 
that must have been the reason, yeah?  And amon
g others, she used me , too. So, what can I tell 
you?  Then she collected the apron, and brought me
 a new one. So she -- I don™t know what -- she 
collected probably the one which was full of stuff, and brought me  one empty. And that™s how 
she worked, because for what reason she brought me  aprons? 

Q: Right. Many -- 

A: Can you imagine?  Huh?  Then I have found an -- a woma n, I still have to look for it, in 

Australia, who brought an story that she had -- 
she was sewing aprons for -- for -- for Rosa. 
Special ones, yeah. 

Q: Uh-huh. Were you surprised when they
 were captured, the [indecipherable] 
A: When she was captured? 

Q: Yeah. 

A: No. 

Q: No.  
A: No. 
Q: Did you have -- you -- you be -- you were alrea
dy suspicious that she was doing some thing? 
A: No, I was not. 

Q: You weren™t? 

A: I was not, no. I was not. We  had -- she was am
ong those people I like, and we had nice chats 
together, but she never recruited me , also. She as
ked me  for favors, I asked her for favors, but 
that was norma l business, like to help the people,
 yeah. And it -- because she has -- I knew that 
there are no Polish Jewish girls in the cam
p office, so I gladly helped her out. 
Q: Now wh y was that the case?  Why were ther
e no Polish Jewish girl
s in the camp office? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
174 
 
A: Because the camp offi ce had a lot of Pole -- 
Poles, non-Jews. Ca mp office, and the arbatz 
einsatz, yeah, and the rest were Slovakian girls.
 We were there before the Poles, before the 
Polish Jews, and the Poles were more or less
 simultaneously comi ng with us around the same  
time. So, we  have occupied the good places, while the Poles -- Polish gi rls had no German 
knowledge, yeah. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: That was among othe rs there mi  
[indecipherable] their disadvantage. 
Q: Right. 

A: And that™s about it. 

Q: Okay. 

A: There™s no more to add. Everything else is 
speculation and is blow -- blow -- blown up into 

some thing so that people can write. But Rosa R
obbata was an ordinary gi
rl, who just did what 
she felt is important, and she did it skillfull
y, and I don™t know how she gots -- how she -- how 
she was caught. That I™ll never found out.  

Q: Okay, we™re at the end of tape number six, side B 
End of Tape Six, Side B 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
175 
 
Beginning Ta pe Seven, Side A 
Q: -- Memorial Museum interview with He
len Tichauer on September eighth, year 2000, 
conducted by Joan Ringleheim, this is side A. 

A: May I ask you some t hing? 

Q: Yes. 

A: Do you really s -- reme mber that everybody i
gnored me  at the first meeting that™s -- 
Q: Yes. 

A: Because I never had the feeling that I was igno
red, I just have taken the people how they are, 
but I didn™t know why. 

Q: No, that -- that meeting, 20 -- I don™t know when it was -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- 20 years ago. 

A: Yeah. 
Q: It™s my recollection, but it™s
 not that clear, but there™s some
 recollection that you said a few 
things, but people didn™t want to
 pay any attention. That™s my 
ere -- that™s my recollection. 
A: Who wer e  the pe
ople with the -- 
Q: I don™t reme mber. 
A: Did -- wait a mi nute, do you mean the other 
people, or you mean Einstan the lecturer? 
Q: The lecturer, and the other peop
le I™m not sure. It didn™t seem 
to me  t hat people were able -- 
A: Understood. 

Q: Understood what you were saying, and were able to concentrate on that. 

A: Yeah. So that was their bad luck. 

Q: That™s right, absolutely.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
176 
 
A: What about you? 
Q: I don™t reme mber me. I probably didn™t know 
what to make of anything. I don™t -- I don™t 
reme mber it, Sippy, I really don™t. 

A: I -- 

Q: So let me  ask you this. I™m going to continue wh
at you just said to me  when we we re off the 

tape. When -- when Anna Polarchik was being in
terviewed, she made some statement that she 
thought you were in the underground. 

A: It™s on her interview, in Polish. 

Q: Right, right, right, right. 

A: Not she thinks, she is sure.  

Q: She™s sure. Okay. So what -- what is 
it about what you were 
doing that would ma ke 
some body t hink that -- that you mi ght have been in -- 

A: I had an daily visitor, and that was a ma
n, an Pole, who was known -- who was the only ma n 
who was living in the wome n™s ca mp. And his na
me  was En -- Hen -- Henyek Borepsky. Henyek 
Borepsky was the official electrician, who was in 
charge of checking the wi
rings, electric wiring, 
all over the whole area. Henyek Borepsky was th
e one who buried s -- ma ny of the Jewish and 
non-Jewish reports the people wrote 
in all their languages, in -- w
ho buried that during our stay 
there, and then after the war, made it possible 
to un-bury the stuff. We  ha ve more stuff, the 
information we had after the war, thanks to him, 
and due to him. Now, he  isn™t -- he isn™t quoted 
in most of the literature by important histor
ians, like Lunkbine me nti
oned him too, but he is 
described very well in the book by -- 
called ﬁFighting Auschwitz,ﬂ yeah? 
Q: By Garlinsky. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
177 
 
A: As he visited me  every day, she didn™t know 
what business he has to do with me , ye ah?  Who 
am -- what -- otherwise he -- there was no loveaffair, he was not my boyfriend. He was just 
visiting me , and she doesn™t know what we -- wh
at business we had to do, except he wa s the 

representative of the top ma n, 
who was leading the Polish unde
rground, yeah?  So that why she 
suspected me , I must have had some thing to dowith them. That™s all. And he asked me  for 

hundred thousand things to do for him, and I ne
ver have asked any questions, I did it. So, I 
probably worked for the Polish underground with
out know -- I knew I worked for somebody, or 
I did things for some body, but I have not ask any 
questions. That was an very basic rule, if you 

do some thing, either you do it or not, and if you 
are doing it, don™t ask que
stions, because what 
you know -- you should never know, in case you were caught.  

Q: So why -- why -- were there people 
that you refused to do things for?  No. 
A: No. 

Q: So you trusted -- is it because the right 
ki nd of people came to you, and you trusted them?   
A: Because it was very hard to appr oach me. 

Q: Why?  

A: For me n. So -- you could not enter 
the camp office just like that, yeah. 
Q: So who -- 

A: And -- and you had no -- and people I have no
t known of through -- even if not talking to 
each other, but there were, in certain jobs es
tablished -- for example, I™ll give you another 
example. You know Gerovitch? 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: He was an outsider of everyt
hing. He was an Bundist, but there 
was one leader of the -- of the 
Bundists, whom he me ntioned in his interview,
 and that was Nonyek. Nonyek was an French and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
178 
 
Polish Jew who was comi ng from France. Later on, he
 became an medic al st
udent, after the war, 
and practiced me dicine. But it was Nonyek whom
 was one day arrived to the camp office, 
straightforward to me , and said, ﬁSippy, I need 
the figures of French 
wome n, how many arrived 
up til now, and how ma ny ar
e still alive.ﬂ Now, I could have told him, ﬁ Why do you ask me , ask 
some body else,ﬂ yeah?  But I had access. He rese
arched me  before he came. I had access to 
everythi ng, because I designed the card totake, yeah. So I -- 
Q: Designed the what? 

A: The card totake. The types of cardex. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: I designed it. 

Q: Yeah, I know, but you just use -- you used 
a word, what™s that word? Cardatteck? 
A: Cardex is an -- 

Q: Cardex. 
A: Cardex. 
Q: Okay. So he knew that? 

A: I knew that -- I knew -- they knew that I -- 
I can have the access to it, because nobody would 
have questioned me , what are you 
doing there, right?  So, I -- 
and two mi nutes later, I wa s 
comi ng with the answer. After all, I had constant 
reports of certain things
, I told you that I did 
the diagrams and so on, so I didn™t -- I knew exac
tly w-w-what to look for, and where to look 
for, and quickly, so that -- because there coul
d have been any time, somebody comi ng from the 
SS, and so on. But we always had some  people out 
at the door entrance to 
watch out. In any case, 
Nonyek arrived, and asked me  for infor mation. 
He got the infor mation, which he reported 
afterwards, but I couldn™t care less how, and 
to whom. But I  know through Gerovitch now, in his 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
179 
 
interview, that Nonyek was the l
eader of the Bund, okay?  So that
 what I™m trying to tell you. I 
haven™t ask him what do you need that for?  Wh
e n I noticed he was comi ng with some thing 
important, of question, he got his answer. And 
that™s how I worked. Whoever was comi ng with 
important questions, he got his [i
ndecipherable] he got the right 
answer. I don™t know what I did, 
and to whom I was giving, and how much I did, y
eah?  Or that Henyek, what he have asked me , 
is hard to believe, but that™s 
an whole story, you have to -- to
 -- Henyek was always asking me  
impossible things. 
Q: Like what? 

A: To -- to a shell of an watch, yeah. And t-to 
write down doxsa, that was an tradema r k. I said, 
ﬁHenyek, you can get at Canada, as ma ny doxsa s
 you want. Why do you want me  to write on 
that particular watch, which is 
empt y inside, doxsa? ﬂ ﬁJust do it.ﬂ 
That what he said. Now, what  
he did afterwards with that, if they have smuggled 
some thing in the container, if that was just to 

recognize that it is an di fferent doxsa, because 
my writing and my -- must have been different 
than the original print. But then, from then on, he was comi ng with similar mi shugas, yeah, to do 

for him, and I did it. I never asked any questions
. But I know that not only
 that I did some thing 
valuable, I have been protected by the Polis
h underground, just like th
ey protected them -- 
themself, and their agents. That what I know. I 
really ma de my office available for their get 
together, yeah. 

Q: So you would leave? 

A: Huh?  

Q: You would leave, they would come  in and you would leave? 

A: Who?  

Q: When they got together, you left the office? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
180 
 
A: I left the office. At -- 
I was running all the time ar
ound the camp, and [indecipherable] 
thought I™m a runner. 
Q: So did they -- did they just come  in and say -- 

A: Nothing. The first time when they were co
mi ng, and all the wome n from everywhere were 
comi ng, the first time  in, they said, ﬁSippy, leave us
 alone.ﬂ I did that, and when they co -- were 

comi ng afterwards, and I left by mys e lf. 

Q: They didn™t have to ask you. 

A: Huh?  

Q: They didn™t have to ask you. 

A: No. 

Q: So in what ways 
did they protect you? 

A: What can I tell you, in what way. They -- th
ey were watching out I should -- nobody should 
do any harm to me , yeah. They watched -- look, th-t
h-that -- they were an very close-knit group 
of Polish officers, and their wives, bu
t I belong -- I was one of them, yea h? 
Q: Tell me  how your reputation got into the me n™s camp. Irwin said he knew who -- 

A: Into what? 

Q: Into the men™s camp. 

A: My reputation? 

Q: Yes, because Irwin sa id one day wh
en I was here, ﬁI knew who Sippy was.ﬂ 
A: Huh?  

Q: I knew who Sippy was. 

A: Yeah? 

Q: Before she -- before he me t you. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
181 
 
A: Yeah. Oh, that was different. I tell you. On
e nice day, Hessler was comi ng, and said, ﬁSippy, 
we are going to transfer you, I have now taken over 
some  -- some  duties at the onione factory.ﬂ I, 
Hessler. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: ﬁAnd we are going to transfer 
a -- you to the onione as technica
l draftswoma n.ﬂ I said, ﬁBut I 
was not trained as an technical draftswoma n. I™m a 
graphic artist.ﬂ He said to me , ﬁThe way how 
I know you, you know everything.ﬂ That what Hessler
 said to me . So, I didn™t know, but Irwin 
told me  afterwards, while we were ma rrie
d, what happened. S -- Hessler was comi ng, and 
explained to the civi lian engineers there, ﬁWe 
are -- we are -- we are going to get now a woman, 
a draftswoman. She™s very peculiar, very exact, 
very moody. Empty fund room for her, bring in 
instrume nts, bring in everything. She will be as 
-- from now on, your draftswoma n. And Irwin is 

going to supervise her.ﬂ 

Q: So, what happened? 
A: I was fighting, hiding behind 
Katya, and Drexel, that I don™
t want to go. And they were 
winning. I didn™t had to go. And I ne
ver arrived to the onione. Good. So
 he knew that I exist, but 
he didn™t know that -- who I am, y
eah. Just a woma n, a draft swoma n. 
Q: Yeah. But he knew your name? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Sippy. 

A: Good. Now -- then Mengele was comi ng. He want
ed me  as an draftswoma n whe n he heard 
about me , as a mi croscopic draftswoma n. There I 
was fighting again. I am 
not -- I wa sn™t trained 
as an mi croscopic draftswoma n. But  we will 
find for you somebody, and we have found for him 
-- what is her name ?  That woma n wh
o is now fli -- claimi ng her work? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
182 
 
Q: Whoop, the phone. We™re back. That was the fa x, not the phone. 
A: So, that why Irwin knew about me . I stayed at 
the camp office, and that was it. But we wanted 
to talk about some thing else. You were just s -- pu
tting in -- in that Irwin business. Wh at was the 
next question? 

Q: No, I was asking you about th
e requests that people ma de. 
A: About what people™s name ?  

Q: What people were asking you to do. 

A: Oh. Several -- several thi
ngs. No people. I have been working for the French Bund, through 

Nonyek, and fr -- for the Poles. 

Q: Right. No, I guess it was because you were talk
ing about the Poles, and I was ask -- then 
asking you how did Irwin hear about 
you. And that™s -- and that™s how -- 
A: Oh, right, but that how, yeah? 

Q: Right. 
A: Because that was just  an one ti -- time  
when he was fighting for my transfer -- 
Q: Right, right. 
A: -- but lost, yeah? 

Q: Right. That™s such a co -- funny coincidence, isn™t it? 

A: Yeah, it™s an funny coincide
nce. You know, the pr
ostitutes in the onione, who were the 
fore ma n, some  Ger man wome n, Irwin told me  even
 ma de fun out of me . They said, ﬁLook, that 
woma n, she ma kes -- she goes on the -- you -- you know, in German, ma ngeet umstreesh. If you 

are an prostitute, you are going wher
e the stripe is ma rked, and that
 is called -- 
I don™t know in 
English, if -- if they use the word, the stripe -- 

Q: You me a n on the road? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
183 
 
A: Yeah. For prostitutes, they -- 
they are not allowed to cross. 
Q: Really? 
A: But in Germany, it™s a stree -- ma ngeet umst
reesh, yeah?  Mangeet umstreesh. Now, I painted 
the stripes. 

Q: Right. 

A: And then [indecipherable] then she ma de hernumbers, yeah?  And th-that was an joke, but it 

was true. Look, there was 
humor in Auschwitz, too. 
Q: Yes, I understand. Tell me 
some thing about revenge.  

A: Revenge? 

Q: Yeah. Or let -- I can put it more simply. If 
there were kapos, or blockeltestes, or other 
prisoners, who were trea
ting other people badly. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: You told me  a long time ago that you could 
get people punished. Katya could put people on a 
punishme nt detail. 

A: Yeah. Now, I tell you what we did, a
nd I can tell you that honestly. The book of the 
punishme nt detail, was kept in the camp office 
under -- strictly under Katya™s supervision. But, 
as I me ntioned before to you, that most book were 
supplied with plain sheets, only lines, and we 
had -- I ha d to put, or designs, or columns necessa
ry for an particular situation, like bloc k books, 
where we knew how ma ny columns, and for what. So
 where the columns established in that br  -- 
punishme nt book, where you had the name s, number s, the punishme nt, the duration from, too, 

yeah? Transferred then and to -- 
to be  released then and then. 
And if there were some  of the 
kapos, or some  of the blockelteste, who accident al
ly, for any reason, had -- have been transferred 
to the punishment block, if they were lousy, ba
d people, Katya took the 
liberty to ask me  to

extend the duration, okay?  And that was the onl
y way how we could ta
ke revenge on those 
people. Now, that is unofficial, but I™m telling yo
u, that™s what we did. And it was good that we 
could do it. 
Q: So did -- did people understand that th
at™s what you were doing to them -- 
A: Pardon?  

Q: -- so that -- did peop
le know that this -- 
A: I never menti --  

Q: I don™t -- 

A: -- to whom should I have spoken about it? 

Q: No, no, no, did they figure it out? 

A: They? 

Q: Yeah. 

A: No. 
Q: No. They didn™t? 
A: No.  

Q: But you did tell me  the story of one 
woma n, who was a kapo, and that you -- some body 
planted cigarettes on her, so th
at she would get caught 
-- this is what you told me , so s e e if it 
recalls -- 

A: I told you this? 

Q: You told me  this. She was sent to a punishme nt detail. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: And then she came back. 

A: And?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
185 
 
Q: And she said she wanted her old job back. A
nd Katya, or some body said to her, ﬁWe™ll give 
you the old job back, but if you st
art doing what you did before,ﬂ 
I don™t know what sort of a 
threat there was, but there was a th
reat. Do you have any recollection? 
A: It™s too -- I would have, if you w
ould explain that the way I said it. 
Q: We ll, I™ll go back. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: I will fi nd -- I will find -- 

A: Find -- find -- 

Q: -- how I put it down. 

A: That™s better. 

Q: Okay. 

A: But I have to check my -- my fax. 

Q: Right. Okay. 
A: Wa it a minute, you have to take that off? 
Q: We ™re going to stop -- we™re going to stop fo
r a mo ment. All right, we
™re now back from our 
little break, there was no fax. And at
 a later time , we™ll go back to this example, and then -- 
A: Yeah, sure. 

Q: -- ma ybe you can explain -- you can explain mo
re. Wa s -- were there any instances where you 
could denounce an SS?  So n -- 

A: N-No. 

Q: No. 

A: No. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
186 
 
Q: If an -- if an SS was having an a -- a Germ
an was having an affair
 with a Jewish wo ma n, 
could that be -- it happened. 
A: Could be. Yeah. 

Q: Rarely, but it would happen. He was in great danger, wasn™t he? 

A: Yeah, very great. 

Q: Why did they do it? 

A: Why do people -- 

Q: Do anything. 

A: -- kill each other?  They™re in danger too, to 
be locked up, and they ar
e doing it. That I cannot 
answer. 

Q: Yeah. And there were no instan
ces that you knew of an S -- 
A: Why that Jewish woma n was falli
ng in love with an SS ma n, yeah?  

Q: Yeah, right.

187 
 
Q: Wa s an SS?  He wasn™t a prisoner? Uh-huh. I gue
ss I should have known that. At so -- at some  
point you said to me  that the SS were
 afraid of Katya, is that true? 
A: Everybody was afraid of her because she had 
such influence on the top ma nageme nt, yeah. 
Q: Uh-huh. And why wa s she so respected? 
A: Because she was clever. She did a 
good job, and nobody could fool her, yeah.  
Q: How -- 

A: And her -- 

Q: Go ahead. 

A: Fool her. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: And she -- her job, not only that she helped he
rself and some  fellow inma te, but she pretended 
to help the SS, but she did not, yeah. She was ve
ry, very, very skillful, and -- by manipulating the 
whole business, yeah. 
Q: Wa s she your age? 
A: Younger. 

Q: Younger? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: So how younger was --

Q: So she was -- 
A: She was 22. 

Q: Two. 

A: Uh ha ha. 

Q: Uh ha ha. You said to me  that -- 

A: What I said now comes -- now I am getting --  going through the mill --  

Q: You™re right. 

A: -- like -- like an interrogation, 
like an judge, or like an prosecutor. 
Q: No, I just want more infor mation. 

A: You said -- no. 

Q: I just want you to know that that™s where I™m getting it from -- 

A: I know. Okay. 

Q: -- first. Okay. You said that by the -- actual
ly, Irwin said the same thing to me, that the 
beatings -- the regularity of beatings 
of prisoners stopped 
in ™40 -- stopped. 
A: What stopped? 

Q: Beatings. The regular beatings. 

A: Ah, beating, yeah. 

Q: Beating, the prisoners stopped by the e
nd of 1943. Now this is what Irwin said. 
A: Yeah? 

Q: Irwin said the SS found it more 
convenient to steal things, than 
to beat prisoners. That™s what 
he said. But you said that while it was a standa
rd for the dignitaries, the Germans when they 
came in, to watch beatings at first. 

A: Yeah? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
189 
 
Q: Once you had the mo del, they came  into the office, and your office was a -- a their 
entertainment. 

A: A showcase, a showcase, 

Q: Yes. All of it. 

A: Huh?  

Q: All of it. Your tools, your mode
l, everything was a showcase for them. 
A: Right. 

Q: And they didn™t mi nd that that 
was a substitute?  They didn™t -- 
A: They didn™t know. They didn™t know, because they were not there before, yeah. And they 

haven™t asked for anything. So they -- they ha
ven™t asked to per -- to perform the beating. 
Q: Beatings, right. So who deci
 -- I mean, wha -- I know this 
is -- sounds like stupid question. 
A: What? 

Q: But, why would they bring in these people, an
d then what they show them is the beating? 
A: Because that is -- 

Q: Power? 

A: -- SS me ntality, yeah. That how 
we deal with our prisoners. 
Q: Uh-huh. So -- 

A: Cruelty was -- crue lty was introduced as an -- as
 an skill, and an so-called science. It was part 
of their daily -- 
daily routine. 
Q: Right. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: So let -- I don™t know if you know the answer to this question. 

A: No. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
190 
 
Q: But when they would do those beatings -- 
A: Yeah, uh-huh? 

Q: -- those public beatings, were th
ey simply picking anybody, or th -- 
A: No, no, no, no, no. 

Q: -- or these were really punishme nt -- 

A: [indecipherable] it was part of -- 

Q: -- for partic -- some thing particular. 

A: They were punishme nt -- look, there were pris
oners who were sent over from prison, or from 
other camps, with an order to receive 25 beats, or 12, or 10. 

Q: Right. 

A: It was part of their -- of
 their punishme nt to receive, and they were keeping that for the 
visitors, to -- to demonstrat
e how they are doing it, yeah? 
Q: Yeah, right. 
A: And that™s gone crazy, and crazy, and ther
e was an doctor present, and when the people 
collapsed, they were brought to the hospital 
compound, yeah. And they were ma inly non-Jewish 
prisoners. 
Q: Who wer e  beaten? 

A: Because they knew where -- ba -- ma inly 
non-Jewish prisoners, because they were comi ng 
through an police station, or thr
ough another jail, or through -- or 
sentenced by an judge to -- to 
receive the beating, yeah. They we
re mostly non-Jewish prisoners. 
Q: Did you observe these beatings? 

A: No, you could -- it wa s never an open -- open 
-- open show. There were always dignitaries 
there of the camp dignitaries, or -- I was 
not a camp dignitary, or some  SS people. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0462  
191 
 
Q: So they -- 
A: And sometimes the camp dignitaries had to do
 the beating. And if th
e beating were not done 
properly hard, then the same  dignitary was put on th
e -- on the -- that type of tool -- not tool, an 
desk, or whatever it -- I must show you one da
y how it looked. And he was beaten, or she was 
beaten by some body else. So, it was 
quite an s -- science, yeah. 
Q: So they didn™t use it in orde
r to show the rest of the camp? 
A: Oh no. 

Q: To frighten anyone? 

A: No. 

Q: No, this was really a internal show. 

A: It was mainly done inside of an building. 

Q: I see, I see. Okay, Sip. 

A: What else? 
Q: I th -- I think for today, I™m finished. 
A: You are finished, okay. 

Q: And so are you. So this is the end of tape
