Question:  Ar on, can you tell me  your full name , a nd when and where you were born? 

 

Answer:  My name  was Aron Dereczynski and no
w we change to Aron De
rman D-E-R-M-A-N.  
I was born in Slonim, Poland.  That's a small to
wn in White Russia, part of Poland in White 
Russia, not far from the Russian border.  I was 
born in 1922, and since I spent there almost until, 
till the War.  Now, my fa mily was a mi ddle cl
ass fa mily.  My parents had a business.  The 
business was a clothing store, and 
I had three sisters:  An oldest
 sister of mi ne was the name  
Libby, Libby.  Then I came , Aron, and after me  
was a younger sister, Fagel, and then a younger 
sister after by the name  Edcia.  Fagel was bor
n three years after me  in 1924, and Edcia was born 
in 1932.  Life was pretty norma l for us.  The city
 was not a large town.  It was approxima tely 
about 12,000 and out of the 12,000 we had almo st 
10,000 Jews, so the majority were Jewish.  
The city was rich with all different kinds of Je
wish institutions.  We  had quite a few, I could 
count eight or 10 different kind 
of synagogues, little synagogues, 
and it was a learning center for 
Œ  we had famous rabbis, fa mous yeshiva, and th
e town was, for me , it was a very happy town, a 
very happy place to live because the ma jority we
re Jews and Antisemitism was quite prominent 
in Poland.  And, so we did not feel that much b
ecause the city was the majority of Jews and the 
neighborhood where we lived was Jewish, so we ha
d hardly any problems until in the later years 
when it came to the 30s when Hitler got into pow
er and the Nazis st arted getting into power.  
Antisemitism spread much more in Poland, and th
en we started feeling from Antisemitism even 
being the majority of Jews.  We still start feeling Antisemitism in two different channels.  For 

example, we  had a river in our city, and the river 
near that to enlarge it so
 they brought in the Œ  
brought in the Polish workers from the different 
cities, from Poznan, and Poznan was known as a 
city of lots of Antisemitism.  So, approxima tely at that time, they brought in ma ybe about 500 to 

700 Polish workers.  And then on a weekend when they used to get drunk and come  in and do 

quite a bit of damage, the Antisemitic Œ  all di fferent kinds of Antisemitic acts.   

 

02:14:49 

 

So, we used to feel partially already Antisemitis
m and then through other channels.  The church 
used to order some  old me n to preach on Sunday, a
ll di fferent kind of acts against the Jews, that 

they were taking over the business, because it wa
s mostly Œ  the business was in Jewish hands 
and for ma ny reasons, because the ma jority 90 percent were Jews.  So, even in my town you 

could find a lawyer, the doctor, th
e engineer, but at the same tim
e the carpenter, the shoemaker, 
and any type of work.  The professionals were Je
ws, and so were the hard working and the daily 
workers were Jews.  So, actually it was no different because  the Jews took over the bigger jobs, 

or the better jobs.  But in the sa
me time some of the priests were
 preaching in church and telling 
that the Jews are running the business, which wa
s completely untrue, for the reason that I was 
saying.

[Technical conversation] 
 

Q:  When the Antisemitism starte
d increasing, this was roughly when? 
 

A:  It was about 1935, 1936. 

 

Q:  Tell me  about your involveme nt with the you
th move me nts.  Tell me  when you first got 
involved in it and why? 

 

A:  Okay.  I got involved in the youth move me
nt, was approxima tely when approxima tely I was 
about 10 years old.  I belonged to Ha-Shomer ha
-Za™ir.  It was an organization, a Zi onist 
organization, and mostly in my home  town, th
e youth belonged to different kind of Zionist 

organization, but it happened that the Ha-Shome r 
ha-Za™ir was one of the larger ones, and it was 
a very Œ a social outlet, and at th
e same ti me we learned a lot, at 
that time  we learned a lot about 
Palestine, in hoping that some way in some ti me I 
will all be able to emigrate to Palest ine.  And 
this way was going on for quite a few years, fr
om 1932, 1933, 1934, in the years to come , in the 
summers we used to go to different Œ  for vacatio
ns.  We  used to go to camps for about a month, 
or six week camps.  And in the camp s we used 
to have 50, 75 kids my age from different small 
towns, from different towns from di fferent ar
eas, and that's where we spent almost every 
summer.  In the same  way as my two other sister
s belonged to.  They were
 not together in the 
same  Œ  they were a different age, so they
 belonged to different groups.  We had a reason 
partially for that because we thought we have 
no future.  We , already, by that time  we were 
thinking that we had no future to
 live in Poland.  So, our dream was that some  day that we were 
going to mo ve to Palestine, especially for me .  
In the later years, in 
1937, I applied to go to 
agriculture school in Palestine.  So, I 
applied to be accepted with Youth Aliyah
1
.  And by that 
time it was impossible, almost i mpossible to get a 
special visa to go to Palestine.  The only way 
you could was a small window of opportunity wa
s it being a youngster with Youth Aliyah and 
going to agriculture school.   

 

02:19:27 

 

So, some  of my friends already 
went there.  So, I had some  fr
iends in Palestine, and I was 
waiting the time will come, and I will get my visa, 
and I will move to Palestine.  And then the 
war broke out, and I never was able to get the visa and emigrate to Palestine. 

 

Q:  In the time  be fore the war broke out, what 
did your parents think about everything that was 
going on; do you reme mber their 
talking about the Antisemitism?  
 

A:  Yes.  I reme mber talking about it because we
 did not have any stores
 which were not Jewish, 
and all of a sudden, they Œ  some  way, they got
 organized and they ope
ned up stores, supported, I 
don't know by whom.  It was partially ma ybe by 
the government.  I don't know from whom.  I 
was too young to understand probably, or to know. 
 And they opened up stores with special 
competition to our stor es, not only to clothi ng stores
, but in all diffe rent kinds of business.  If it 

would be a food store or anything 
else and to cut down the prices 
and even already some places

they stood, or they hired special young people to 
stay by the store, and most of our customers 
were farmers or comi ng in from s mal l towns, and 
they used to stand in 
the store by telling them, 
ﬁDon't go in, that's a Jewish store.ﬂ  And don't let 
him go in.  They stood in front of the store and 
didn't let customer or farmers walk in.  We
 couldn't do much hardly about it, because you 
couldn't go to the police.  The police wouldn't 
help you or do you, because we hardly had, even 
with a city like this,  I don't re me mbe r , ma ybe
 we  had one.  We didn't even have a Jewish 
policeman in the city.  So, everything, I mean 
like the governme nt, the city jobs were held by 
Gentiles, but not Jews.  And so 
life was getting little by little
 it was getting rougher.  And the 
question is ﬁWhy didn't they move out, why didn'
t they go to America, why didn't they go to a 
different part of the country? ﬂ  It
 wasn't  so easy when your parents,
 or my parents, we lived in a 
house, but ma ybe the house was 100 years.  My fath
er lived there, my grandfather lived there, 
who knows who before, and we lived in the pl ace a
nd for us it was settled.  Plus the family, all 
the family that we had, and we had quite a 
large family, we had I believe over 80 people, 
me mbers in the fa mily.  They all lived in the sa me area, not too fa r.  So life  was almo st a 
comfortable life.  It wasn't  a rich life.  It wa
sn't  luxury, but for us, we felt that we had all the 
luxury that we wanted, so life was almost, we c
ould say, special like normal, until the last  years 
when they started Antisemitism.  So, that too, 
we had in our city and prot ection.  We  had the 
strong me n.  Who were the strong me n?   Sl oni
m had all the Œ  how would you call them, the 

ﬁdraggers
2
.ﬂ  It means the people who would load from
 the trucks Œ  from t he trains, load the 
me rchandise, put them on trucks, at that time  it 
was more horse and buggy, to deliver to the other 
cities.  It was the strong guys.  And in our city two strong guys, quite a few other ones, but two 

of them were the ma in two strong guys.  In fact, 
I reme mber the name of them.  One of them was  
Haskel and one of them was Note.  So, by that 
time , ar ms was not available.  Nobody used arms, 
but he could find out if some body,  Polish kids
, or Polish young me n come and did some thing, 
hid or did some  da ma ge t o some  of the Jewish people, he could come  up t o him and break his 

arm or break his leg.  And that was the punishme nt, 
and they were afraid.  So, we had that.  That 
was in our favor.  We  ha d this strong ma n 
were with us.  So, usually it wa s like a good 
protection.  And that's the way it was going on almost until the war. 

 

Q:  Tell me  about the war breaking out and t
hose first few weeks after.  Te ll me  what you 
reme mber of the mo ments and what you heard? 

 

A:  We  had two accidents of war, as far as I'
m reme mbering.  The first one was when the pact 
was ma de up between Russia and Germany Œ Ribben
trop and Molotov Œ when they decided they 
were going to split up Poland, and they split up our part of the country where I lived.

So, at that time  when it happened, that transfer
 wa s the expectation was very Œ  was almost, I 
mean, we didn't know it was going to happen.  We
 didn't know what the deal was.  So, we 
thought, we didn't know who was going to occupy our part of the land Sl onim, until we realized 

that all of sudden the Russian
s are the ones to occupy our Slonim.  It was a tremendous,

tremendous exciteme nt, and we were very happy, because we didn't know what the Russians 
were going to do us, but we knew th
at between the two evils, we 
called them at that time, the 
Russians were much better.  Because the Germans, 
we knew, if they are going to come , they are 

going to be much worse.  We  did not know about
 any killings.  We  di
d not know about anything 
they were going to do, but so, but we heard Œ  in 
the 30s Hitler was already in power Œ  what he 
did to some  refugees that came to our town when
 they were thrown out from Ger many, and they 
came to Slonim, and they told us what's happening in Germa ny.  And here, the Russians came, 

so we were very, very happy.  And me  being a kid, I jumped on the tanks when the tanks moved 

in, and they were very friendly, so we  jumped Œ ki ds Œ  on top of the tank comi ng into the city.  

We were very, very happy, but only thing a little
 accident  happened.  I was wearing a nice watch, 
that I had got for my bar mitzvah, and here I 
am on the tank, and the Russian officer come s in, 
and he says, ﬁI like your watc
h.  How much do you want?ﬂ  I reme mber I paid like something a 
small a mount of money 10 dollars, 10 zlotys wh
atever it is.  He give
s me  20, 25 zlotys, so I 
figure, ﬁOh-ho!  It's a big deal.  I'm going to 
give him the watch, and I'm going to go out to the 
store and buy another one.™  Sure enough, I couldn't get another watch anymore.  So, but this was 

indeed to every place they came in like hungry. 
 I mean, they were hungr
y for me rchandise, for 
things.  So, they were grabbing and running in
 the stores, and taking away, buying out Œ they 
didn™t take away Œ  buy outŒ  but they give us pie
ce of paper, rubles, but we
 didn't realize that we 
wouldn't be able to repla
ce like in our store.  They come  inand they bought out 
the whole store.  
The whole shelves in couple days, one day almost
.  But my little experience with the watch, and 

then I found out it had happened with everybody el
se.  They were buying out, but ma inly we 
were terrible happy.  The ma terial things didn't 
bother us, because the question was of life and 
death and what war was going to bring in.  So this
 ma terial things was ju
st past and didn't mean 
anything.  We were very happy by 
being occupied that time  by 
Russia.  Then, I had another 
experience.  Years Œ  I'm comi ng back to the sa
me Œ  belonging to the Zionist organization.  So 
our togetherness, or our organizatio
n, still didn't disband, but we went secretly.  So, we were part 
in this Zi onist organization.   

 

02:30:35 

 

And here I got an order, two of us, for  me  a
nd another friend of mi ne, to go to Wilno, fr om 
Slonim to Wilno, which is appr
oximately, I don™t know, maybe 200 k
ilome ters.  So, we  went for 
train, and they said in Wilno we 
have the Zionist organization is 
active and we should take a ride 
over there and see what kind of connections we 
can ma ke and ma ybe I can find the connections 
to move to Œ go to Palestine.  So, I left my fa m
ily and I went with my friend and I went to Wilno.  
And it turns out, I find out later, 
that being in Wilno, staying over 
there, they gave us, we were 
all in a couple large rooms, a couple long halls,
 and we didn't know yet, if you could go to Œ  
some way to emigrate to Palestine.  
Now, Wilno was Œ  that time was Litwa
4
.  It wasn't  Poland, it 
was part of Litwa.  And the Russians didn't fully o
ccupy it.  So, there was a lot of freedom there.  
What we didn't have here in  Slonim.  And 
being over there I met some ot her young people that 
belonged to Ha-Shomer ha-Za'ir.  That's the 
only way the secret coul
d go on was is knowing 
with the same organization.  That's  illegal, so you 
were afraid to be Œ  I mean to reveal to other 

people to other places.  So, I wa
s there and I got in touch with
 the leadership fr om the Ha-
Shomer ha-Za™ir, and to my disappointment, they
 send me  back home.  They said, ﬁWe need 
leader s in the organization not to leave now, but 
we need them still in the occupied territory,

back in Slonim.ﬂ  So, fortunately for me , at that 
time , I went back home.  I went back to Slonim.  
I was arrested by the way by the Russians on the bor
der, and they took me  as a spy, but I came  
back to Slonim.  In Slonim, I was back with my fa mily until the real  war broke out between Œ  
under the Russian occupation.  I wanted to follow 
my education, so I went to a technical school, 
a Russian technical school. And, what
 I learned there is to be ma in
ly partly  of engineering in 
movie projectors.  The whole movi e contents of
 the system, how the pr
ojector works, how the 
film works. By that time  it was a novelty.   

 

02:33:58 

 

The course took us almo st a year, and then afte
r a year to pay him off,
 e verything was free in 
Russia.  So, they sent  me  away in a small town to show movies on farms in small cities and small 

towns.  That's the same  t hing, it was ma ybe 70, 80
 kilometers from my home town.  In there I 
got a job.  I used to go out and show movies in 
schools.  Collect a few farms or s mall villages 
and show the movies in the school, show Russian movies.  And that was Russian propaganda.  

And being over there, one night on a Saturday nigh
t, I was out on a date, late in the evening, I 
could hear the bombardme nts and the war started, the Russian-Germa n war.  And here it caught 

me  a way from the house, away from home , nobody around, a young fellow, and I had to ma ke 

up a decision, should Œ  it was imme diately panic 
with the Russians comi ng in Œ  should I run 
with the Russians, away from the front, because 
the front wasn't  that far away, or should I go 
back to my home, my hometown?   And I deci
ded I™m was going, going on Œ  to go on the way 
home , and then I'll go away, run away in Russia.   

[Technical conversation]  Going on the way home, al
ready I could feel the war.  What  did I see 

on the road?  What did I see on the wa y?   The Germans were shooting other people and the 

refugees running away.  It was soldiers, it was pl
ain people.  It was people like me , and we were 
trying to stay a little bit 
off the road, and here the Germans used
 to came in with planes and dive 
down and shoot at us.   

 

02: 37:10 

 

Shoot people, innocent people runn
ing and just shooting at them.  The sa me  thing like it would 
be animals or cows.  They were shooting on cows and people in the same  way.  Until the mi ddle 

of the day, so all of sudden I saw a dog fight 
and I was realŒ  because we didn't see any more 
Russians.  The Russians were running away.  They 
were bombed.  They left their vehicles.  They 
didn't have enough gas probably.  They blocked up 
the roads.  It was a real panic on the road 
going on, and we thought the Russians lost the war al
ready.  I mean what we could see.  I'm sure 
they were just running from the front line.  And 
we me t pilots who didn't have a chance to even 
to get in their planes.  The Germans bombed the ai
rports, the air runs.  And they were all running 
back to Russian Œ  closer to the Russian border, 
deeper in Russia.  And he
re I see a dog fight, and 
I was very ha ppy because it gave  me  some  encouragement that ma ybe the Russians are still 

alive, but there were plenty alive.  Observ
ing, so we lied down observing the dog fight.  They 
knocked down the German plane and the German parachut ed right in the place where we were 

there.  So, I took part right with the Germans, be
ing part of the groups th
at were running away.  
So some  of t he Russians, they had the arms, so they went right to the p
ilot where he parachuted 
in and they didn't wait too long.  They killed h
im right on place, but they didn't take away his 
arm.  After they left, I wa s there and I took away
 his gun.  So, that's the first time I already had a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0299  
6 
 
gun by myself, and I thought, ﬁMaybe , I don't know I w
ill have to use it or  not.ﬂ  And that's the 
way it was burning, the roads, the home s in thes
e little towns around were all on fire, all burning, 
and that took me  about one night, and at Œ  prob
ably we got a little bit 
of transportation on the 
way, too.  And the next day, I came to my home t own
 back to Slonim, and that was on a Friday.   
 

02:40:21 

 

I'd say it took us quite a few days between leav
ing the town where we almost Œ for a while I 
thought it™s only a few days Œtha
t™s quite a few days before we came home.  Friday morning, I 
came back home.  I don't have to tell you, I mean the 
joy was real great that 
here their only son Œ  
they had three girls, I wa s the only one son. 
 In Europe being one boy between four, between 
three sisters, so it was a big Œ 
 a son was different than the 
woma n.  I would be the one to 
Kaddish
5
, I would be the one to carry 
the torch, to be the head of
 the fa mily was the Kaddish 
after my fat her.  So, I finally arrived home  and 
sitting over there and Frid
ay evening be fore they 
ma ke Shabbat, the shutters were closed.  I can
 reme mber just like it™s yesterday.  And we are 
sitting home remi niscing the stories, telling 
them again how much I went through the road 
comi ng into my home  to Slonim, and it was late
r around nine, 10 o™clock we were ready to go to 
sleep.  It didn't  take too long before I had the 
chance to fall asleep, we hear like crackles on the 
roof.  The first thing we hear is
 shooting, shooting in our yard.  
I lived in a small courtyard and 
there's shooting going on, and one after the other is
 getting stronger.  The 
shots are getting more 
often, and here I hear crackles on 
the roof.  So, I was thinking, 
ﬁThank God it's raining.ﬂ  But it 
wasn't  raining, the house was on fire.   It wa
s a wooden house and the house caught on fire.  So, 
we were forced to get out.  Now that's  about
 one or two o'clock in the mi dnight, and the only 

thing you could see was from the mo onlight, you 
could see everything what™s happening.  So, 
some  way we ducked out from the house and we ar
e in the yard, and here in the mi ddle of the 
fight is going in between the Germans and the 
Russians.  What happened is, a group of Russians 
Œ  they were left over, the front was already fa
r, far away  but they didn't know Œ  the Russians 
didn't know that there was no more front in here
 and some wa y a fight wa
s going on.  So, we are 
coming out in the middle of the night, and we ar
e immediately arrested by the Germans,  and they 
put us in one place, maybe approximately a
bout 15 or 18 me n and wome n.  The women they 
pushed aside while the me n they took and th
ey ma de everybody, if anybody had a cap on, they 
ma de everybody to take off their caps.  And anybody 
who did not have hair, they put them in one 
place and they shoot them.  They shoot them in our
 back yard.  So here I'm a young fellow, I lost 
my home , a nd now I am witnessing a terrible ma ss
acre of eight or 10 me n.  My luck they didn't 
take me  because I had ha ir.  I wasn't in the Army.  The reason why they looked at our hair is that 

they thought that ma ybe it's Russians, changed their 
clothes.  So, they took the people Œ  and my 
father didn't have much hair, but he probably l
ooked older, so by chance they didn't take him 
either.  But I know the reason why they didn't take me .  So, they killed them, and we had to dig a 

big graveyard, a big hole in our yard, and we burie
d the people there.  Eight or 10 Jews , 12 Jews, 
they killed them and here left over a young 
ma n with no home Œ  comi ng back, no food, no 
home , and by luck by the same  thing, we had another home.

What my parents bought a duplex that some day wh
en my two sisters will have to get ma rried, 
they™ll have a dowry for them.  And t hat was th
e custom in Poland, and it was the custom in the 
old country is  when a woma n gets married she'
ll need a dowry. So, they bought the duplex.  So, 
we went from our house, we went to the duplex, 
we rented it before.  And some  day they will 
give it to my  sisters.  So, we went to the place where we lived, at that time  it was quite a few 
families lived in the house, because  the Russians 
in Slonim Œ  originally, we had something like 
about 10,000 Jews before the war.  But when 
the Russians occupied, lo
ts of refugees from 
Germany were not allowed to live 
in different parts of the countr
y, so they pushed them to our 
area.  In Slonim population grew from 8,000 to 
ma ybe 18 to 20,000, and that was Jews from the 
other pl aces, from Poland.  So, it me ans the house already housed ma ny more people in the same  

apartment.  So, they ma de Œ  they gave us one
 room and after a while this room was split up too. 

So, they give us one room and we slept on the floor.  The family Œ  there was not enough beds, to 

sleep in beds and a new life was started out 
for us to live under the German occupation.

Q:  How long before the ghetto was set up?  
 Tell me  how that whole thing worked. 
 

A:  All right.  Now, this when we lived in our hous
e, Jews still lived in different parts of the city.  
And it didn't take too long approxima tely, that wa
s in June, end of June, about two weeks later 
they started.  An order came  out that all the Jews 
have to mo ve in, in one area, in one part of the 
city.  In our city we had a ri
ver so it Œ  there wasn't  enough room for the 20,000 Jews to move 
them in one section, so they ma de four sections, 
four s mall ghettos.  One larger ghetto and three 
other ghettos, and that was ma ybe about I 
would say, between two weeks or a month. 
 
Q:  This was in? 
 

A:  This was in 1941, June of 1941. 

 

Q:  We re JewsŠ? 

 

A:  Yes, Jews Œ  then Jews Œ  when they put 
them in the ghetto they 
ordered us to put on the 
patch, the yellow patch.  In our places
 it was patches, instead mogen David

Œ  the yellow patch 
in the front of the garme nt and in back of the garment.   

 

02:50:10 

 

You were not allowed to walk on the sidewalk,on the street only.  The ghetto was put up with 

barbed wire, and the ma in thing is
 the order that they put out signs
 and orders that any Jew that 
will be caught outside  of the ghe
tto without Œ I mean outside the 
ghetto will be kill
ed.  There was 
no other punishment.  The punishme nt was, if 
you do not fill the order or  get the command, your 
punishme nt was by death.  And lots of time th
e question comes up is, ﬁWhy did you go in the 

ghetto?   Why didn't you stay outside? ﬂ   It was imme
diately impossible to stay outside, because if 
you were caught, it's death.  And by that time , we
 had no idea that punishment is death.  Who

kills anybody, for what?   And so, everybody went Œ 
 it was no big problem to go into the ghetto 
because nobody knew what is going to happen.  So, 
it was no big, not a big threat not to go in.  
Plus, I mean, the population was very unfrie
ndly and by some  way the Germans would not 
recognize, especially for me , I had a problem. 
 I look Jewish, Se mitic.  For me , I woul d be 
recognized because the poles, most of them blon
de and the wa y Œ  with my look, it would be 
almost impossible to walk on the st
reet and not be recognized that
 I'm Jewish.  So, I went with 
my fa mily.  We went Œ were in
 the ghetto together and the ghe
tto where they ma de, where the 
ghetto was, is where I live d, so I didn't  have to 
move from one place to another.  But next to us 
was three other small ghettos and that's the way our
 bad life started out.  But the question to 
going into the ghetto was no question for me  or my
 fa mily or for anybody else.  Like I said, the 
ma in reason is nobody knew what it was going to be
 gas chambers or anyt
hing else what could 
happen, the killing in the pits.   

 

02:53:19 

 

It was unknown.  But it didn't take too long.  
On July 17, I had another experience.  The 
Germans wa lked in, in the Jewish home s and th
ey took out only ma le, young ma les.   [Technical 
conversation]  And then it came on July 17,1941, a special commander group came in, in the 

city, we didn't  know they were and they walked from house to house, and they took out young 

ma le only.  How did they do it?   They organized 
like a chain.  They told each one to come  out 
from their home s and stand on the street.  And from the street, they had guards organized almost 

every half block.  They ma de you run to a certaindestination.  It was easy
 for them.  They didn't 
have to arrest him and take him from one place 
to the other.  Once you were out of the house, 
you came right to the place, the appointed pl ace.  They ma de  you run.  ﬁRaus, raus, raus!
7
ﬁ and 
hitting you, and they didn't  shoot us at that time
, but hitting us and pushing us until we came to 

the destination.  The destination was on the ma rket
 place.  Near the bi g market pl ace and it was 
near the Jewi sh Theater, bordering 
with the Jewish Theater.  So, they ma de their Œ  they crowded 

us all in one place, and we were approximate
ly 1,500 young people, and here I am caught in the 
mi ddle of there.  And staying there, it was a real 
hot day.  Wha t  were they telling us?   They were 
taking us out to work.  We have some  special a
rranged some  work for us to do, some slave labor.  
And trucks were comi ng up to the pl ace, loadin
g them up, 30, 40 people on the truck and taking 
them away.  I was there with my
 father, and being young, and being 
a little restless, so I say to 
my father Œ  he says, ﬁI'm very terrible thirsty. 
 I see its a spigot with water, right there in the 

back.  I'm going to go right there in the back to 
get a drink of water.ﬂ  So, I was kind of hard to 
push through to go to the back and get to the spigot
 of water.  But that time the line came closer 

and in a few mi nutes I wa s trying to run back to
 be back with my father, and my father was 

loaded on the truck, and I couldn'
t already get in on the same tr
uck.  And my father was taken 
away and by that time I was left over behind. An
d exactly Œ  the punctu
ality of the Germans 
exactly at three o™clock the high 
German officer came in and he said the people the ones that are 
left could go home .  So, I was left over.  Ther
e were left over 300 out of the 1,500, and I was left 
over with the 300.

They ma de an exit where we could run out, and they
 beat us.  They were 
standing with the rifles, 
they hit everybody on the head and the foot and any place where they just go through.  I wasn't  
hit.  I jumpe d over the rifle.  He
 wanted to hit me in the legs, I 
jumped it over.  I came and I went 
back home, and that is the first time I came home 
and here I am the head of the household.  I am 

the young man with three sisters and a mother, and 
my father was taken out.  Where did they 
take him?   They took him only about three or four
 kilome ters away, and they killed them in pits, 
in fact a very shallow pit.  How do we know?   
The Germans even tried, they made some of the 
people to write notes to the ghetto 
that they are fine, they are a
live, and they are working.  And 

then they ki lled them right in the place.  But, some of the mothers, women, mothers, sister s, they 

didn't believe so they went down in a day or two. 
 At that time the ghetto wasn't  so hard to get 
out of the ghetto.  It was right
 from the beginning July 17, it was only a few short while after we 
were occupied.  So, they went out and they found 
the plaŒ  the farmers we
re telling them where 
it happened and the name  was Szpakowo.   

 

02:59:41 

 

They went to the place and they found the clothe
s from their loved ones.  And then it was known 
in the ghetto that they killed them all just only a 
few miles away fr om the city.  That  was the fi rst 
time we found out actually that peop
le were being killed in the pits
.  So, the whole, for me  it was 
Œ it changed my whole way of thinking.  It chan
ged my whole Œ  I accepted immediately and I 
started thinki ng that , ﬁI don't think we will be able to survive.ﬂ  So, we star ted working 

underground with the same  people, with our frie
nds and for us thinking to find a road ma ybe 
some  day we'll be able to go out through the 
underground.  So, immediat
ely already the roots 
was developing.  It was forming for the underground. 
 And my history is a 
lot of survival through 
the underground. 

 
Q:  You said when they rounded ever
ybody up, they rounded up the young me n mostly? 
 
A:  Only me n. 

 

Q:  But your father must have been old, wasn't  he? 

 

A:  He was born in 1890. 

 

Q:  So, he would have been 50? 

 

A:  50 years. 

 

Q:  So, you don't think they were rounding up the leadership of the ghetto young, strong me n? 

 

A:  Yes, younger me n, too Œ  when we read the 
history of the Holocaust, what's happening in 
other pl aces and other towns, it's almost happeni
ng the same way in every other Œ  the other 
places.  It's to take out the strong men.  The able
 me n.  Break up the family, and that was done in 
every town around me .  When I talked to some  pe
ople that survived in 
different cities, and it 
almost happened like a copy of what happened in Sl
onim, happened in differe
nt cities.  They did 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0299  
10 
 
the same  thing.  They called the it chapones
8
.  There's a name even for it.  They came in, they 
grabbed Œ  a one day Aktion
9
 and out.  And tomorrow they went 
in a different city and did the 
same  thing.  So, it was like a plan that was al
l planned out, how they'r e going to follow, how 
they'r e going to do.  But, we had no idea.  We  we
re little, little people 
between a big ma chine.  
We had no idea how they worked.  They had their psychiatry, they had their monies, they had 
their governme nt, they had their plans, and we were 
just small little people
 in the ghetto and not 
knowing anything what™s planned for us.   

 

Q:  So, now, getting involved 
with the underground at
 this point, me n Œ what?   Smuggling? 
 

A:  Ok, now, I got involved Œ  we were i
nvolved in the underground.  The underground was a 

very secretive organization.  They had a reason 
why it has to be secretive.  A lot of time s 
questions come  up, ﬁ Why does it have it to be se
cretive in the ghetto be
tween Jews? ﬂ   It™s a 
reason for it.  You have to be secretive is Œ  I 
am planning to go out.  I 
am planning to save my 
life.  I have around me  a thousand other young pe
ople, not young people.  We 'r e not talking 
about young people.  We  have another 20,000 Jews 
inside the ghetto.  We  are a group of 10, 50, 
100 or 1,000.  We  want to go out to the underground, 
or if not, we want to fight the Nazis in 
open revolt.  So, the question is, "Why don't you ta
ke in more people or why do you have to be 
secretive?ﬂ  Yes, if a group of 10 people or fi
ve people or one person 
goes out from the ghetto, 
let's say he is caught.  The Nazis catch him they get the people.   

 

03:05:16 

 

You tell them you belong to an organization or gr
oup, it's not important.  The fact is, is that 
you're going out through the underground.  Some way 
they have their way to know.  They go in 
the ghetto and they take in 1,000 hostages.
  I'm saying 1,000, it could be 100, 500, 1,000.  
Different areas, it happened different amount.  No
w, I am goi ng out.  My friend, my neighbor is 
not going out.  He is left over ther
e.  He could be part of the host
ages.  He could be part of the 
next Aktion, what we called what would ha
ppen in Poland.  You take out 5,000 people and you 

kill, you pr ecipitate an Aktion what's supposed 
to happen two months later.  You do it, it 
happens tomorrow.  And that's what happened in 
different parts.  In Slonim, I was in Grodno, I 
was in Wilno, and that's why it's secret was so 
much.  It was Œ  you could not afford the other 
people to find out, but we'll talk 
a little bit in a di fferent part . 
 

Q:  You knew that from the outset.  You knew that
 there would be a reprisal because they said 
there would be. 

 

A:  Yes.  Yes, by that time  this in a little bit 
longer, they brought in Slonim, they brought in two 
or three farmers and they were hanging in the mi
ddle of the ma rket with 
saying that, ﬁThis will 
happen to anybody who goes to the partisans or goes
 to the underground or goes to the woods.ﬂ  
Now, that way you could see by the clothes that 
they were wearing, it was innocent farmers.  
You could see they weren't even partisans.  But 
the main thing is the message that  they were 
passing is, ﬁThat's what will happen if anyone 
is caught going to the underground.ﬂ  And in

return is they did ma ny times, is by catching one they
 will take out a Œ  punish other Jews.  Now, 
the next thing that happens Œ  how does a ghe
tto operate?   How does a ghetto work?   How do 
you live in the ghetto.  You're not working, you're 
not earning any money.  How does that work.  
Well, we were pushed into the ghetto, and here
 we re 20,000 people, Jews, in one small little 
area.  We  have no food, and we cannot earn 
any money to buy food.  So, it was forme d a 
Judenrat
10
.  Who is the Jude nrat?  In our town, the 
Judenrat, they took a committee, what they 
were before elders in the city. 
 Their job before the war was li
ke federation, we have it in 
America.  They used to collect money to help 
the poor in different kinds
 of special and Jewish 
city in the Jewish town, there's even lawsuits 
were going on, were settled 
not in court but settled 
between the committees.  So, they were the first on
es when the German oc cupied.  They asked to 
for m a Jewish Judenrat, and that's the committee. 
 So it was the easiest thing to take these people 
to take over the ma nageme nt of the governme nt of the ghetto.  So, the first time we had 
approximately six or eight people th
at belonged to the Judenrat.  
Now, what was their function?   
Their function was Œ  the first thing is to register
 the Jews.  How ma ny J e ws
 are in the ghetto.  It 
had a double purpose.  Number one, the Germans 
wanted to know how many Jews we have 
there.  And the next thing is they used to give 
rations.  So, they gave us
 Œ  you went to register, 
because if you wouldn't go to regi ster, you had no 
way how to get a ration.  So, this was a double 
purpose for the Germans.  They knew exactly 
how ma ny Jews are in 
the ghetto, because 
everybody wants to get food, and the rations were 
very small.  Some thing like 200, 250 gram of 
bread and ma ybe some thing else once in a while. And that was the purpose of the Judenrat.  And 

then at the same   ti me , is the Judenrat for med for Arbeitsamt
11
.   
 

03:11:02 

 

Arbeitsamt means Œ  is when the Germans came in and by that time it was even the 

Wehr macht
12
, the occupied.  We  had two different kinds of Germans.  One was the Nazis and 
one was the Ar my.  So, the army was  just passin
g by, but in this same  time  already they learned 
how to rob, too.  It didn't take long.  So, they got
 orders to the Judenrat
 for slave labor.  How do 
you get the best way slave labor, is you go into 
the Judenrat and you ask for 500 me n.  How do 
you get the 500 me n?   So the Judenrat formed a po
lice, the Jewish police.  The Jewish police got 
the order to go and get the slave laborers, so that
 was one part what was what the Jewish police 
did.  And the other, the next day the Germans cam
e in and they asked for furniture to fix their 
home s.  The Jewish police went with wagons a
nd pulled out the furniture from the homes.  The 
next mi nute they came in and they want 10 kilo 
of gold.  They want 10 kilo of gold Œ  how do 
you get 10 kilo of gold?   It's  not what a Jew ha
d gold in their pocket and 
in the vault, and he 
gives them t he gold.  He had to collect the go
ld.  How do you collect 
the gold.  You get the 
golden watches that they had from hundreds or
 thousands of years whom one passed to each 
other.  They had rings.  They had bracelets, ev
en golden teeth.  In Europe, they had a lot of 
golden teeth.  The dentist used to pull out so
me  teeth or some  people died and they hold Œ 
holding teeth from them Œ or whatever.  All and 
all they accumulate, they had to accumulate 10 
kilo of gold.  That's  a lot of gold.  The next 
week some body else came and they asked for another 
amount.  I don't know if it was 10 or five.  The next 
time they come  in they want to have another

amount of gold.  So, they collect it again.  By 
that time it was much harder to collect, so the 
police had to go to the home s and beg and ask and pl
ead with the richer ones to save our lives Œ  
and we thought so too.   

 

03:14:20 

 

But ma ybe the passing time  you'll buy off yourself 
with the order of the 
gold.  And the third 
time, was no more people, was no more gold to give
 them so they took them out and killed the 
Judenrat.  And what did they say?   That the 
Judenrat collected the gol
d and they kept it for 
themselves, and that's the reason they killed him.  
 That was no reason for that.  They killed them 
because it wasn't  any more gold to 
give it to them.  So, life Œ that
 too, put a panic in the ghetto.  
They have to select another Judenrat.  It was 
harder to get another Judenrat.  So Slonim had a 
history, they had three Judenrats, 
and they were all killed.  By 
the end they had only a Judenrat 
of only one ma n.  That was by the end.  So, life 
was getting, every day, ti
ghter and tighter, and 
comi ng back to the Aktion of the 1,500 me n, till was 
quiet in the ghetto.  We
 called it quiet in 
comparison to the other time s.  So we  called it 
normal, quiet, tranquil.  But it wasn't .  It was 
going on every single day.  By that time, I went ou
t on slave labor.  I got a job working in a place 
they called it the Beutelager
13
.  It was the place where they collected arms, the Russian arms and 
put them in one or two buildings.  So, I found a jobat this particular plac
e, and I had inclination 
that I was a mechanic and being a mechanic, they 
let me work in this particular  place.  Over 
there, in the Beutelager, I work
ed for a few mont hs, and the head
 Œ  a forema n of our group who 
was name d Choraszansky the, the father of one of
 my friends, the one nuc
leus that was in the 
underground.   

 

03:17:11 

 
So, we tried to smuggle in arms to the ghett
o.  How do you smuggle in arms  to the ghetto?   
Every time you came into the ghetto you were sear
ched, and if you are ca
ught with a piece of 
bread Œ  not only a piece of ar m 
Œ  you were killed.  So, we found a way.  The forema n, the one I 
worked with, was very, very friendly with 
the two Germans around the shop.  And it was two 
German offi cers.  Now, they were not Nazis, th
ey were part of the We hr macht and one's  na me  
was Mutz and one was Brown.  So, he got very fri
endly with them.  What was the friendship?   
He could bring out Œ  the fore ma n Œ  was bringi
ng out different kinds of
 clothes and valuables 
whatever they wanted from the ghetto and they ex
changed with him for articles like soap.  And 

they had a lot of soap.  I don't know for what reas
on, but they had lots in their warehouse, they 
had a lot of soap too.  Because 
they had this warehouse, other 
warehouse with food, too, some  of 
it.  So, bartering with them, he ma de a deal with
 them that whatever he pays him some time, he'll 
help him to bring inside the ghetto, because what
 good is it if he gets it 
outside of the ghetto.  
How does he bring it inside the ghetto?   So, what 
he did is, he gave him a boxes of soap.  It's a 
wooden boxes and soap was large pieces like this not
 like we have it he re, and we got an idea is 
to take out the soap under it and put hand gren
ades and put part of guns
 underneath and Mutz 
and Brown would take it into the ghetto with us
, and delivering us the ammunition for us inside 
the ghetto.  And we did it quite a few times until we had well in comparison to any fighting force 

it was not enough arms.  But meanwhile, we brought
 in, we start bringing in arms, and we had 
already, cache of arms.

So, this way, our organization got bigger, then we
 got in a radio which we took out from a tank, a 
broken tank, and we put it together and we got a 
radio inside the ghetto.  And the ghetto was cut 
off from any type of news.  We  had no news, we
 had no radios.  I didn't mention before that 
going into the ghetto you couldn't have a bicycle.
  They took away everything from you if you 
had some thing, no radios, no bicycles, no telephones.
  No nothing, anything like it.  At  the same  
time we had no informat ion.  No newspapers and no 
radios.  Television wasn
™t yet in any place.  
So, we got Œ start getting news, our own news.  We could listen to BBC so we passed the news.  

The ma in thing it was the news for us is how su
ccessful are the Germans wi th the front line.  
That was our ma in news .  We  didn't needŠ

Q:  Why don't you tell me a
bout how that Aktion was? 
 

A:  It was tranquil, and then it came  -- the bi
g Aktion November 14.  Maybe, that's  the way I™ll 
start.  In the ghetto it was tranquil.  It  was almo
st quiet, but not that qui
et .  Once in a while the 
head of the Gestapo used to come  in and puni
sh some body by finding for different reasons and 
ma ybe he didn't take off his hat against him.  An
d from the m he could take out his gun and just 
kill hi m for i t  because  he didn't give respect to him.  That means, the head of the Gestapo comi ng 

in the inside of the ghetto.  We
 called it, it was pr etty quiet and tranquil because no Aktion was 
comi ng on since the taking out the 1,500 men. Until we came  to a big massacre and we called it 

Aktion.  So the German words called it Aktion, and 
from there on we called it also too an Aktion 
is comi ng.  And then here on November 13, I lived right next door to us with a photographer Œ 

lived there photographer and some  Germans used 
to come  in and take pictures, photographs in 
his house to be able to send back to their families.
  So, they took pictur es.  And this particular 
German ca me  in that day and he says, ﬁSomet
hing is going to happen.  I don't know, but lots of 

special groups, and whatever the name
 he called them, Nazis or Kommandos
14
 or Œ  came  in the 
city, and looks like some thing is going to happen. 
 I would suggest, if you 
have a way, hide or 
get out of the ghetto.ﬂ  And other signs was in
 the ghetto that they gave special scheins
15
.  The 
scheins is a special little pi
ece of paper.  The tradesmen, i mportant tradesmen, where they 
worked for the Germans and they call
ed them the special Nützliche Juden
16
.  And in fact some  of 
them they even moved t o a different part the ghetto.   
 
03:30:04 

 

So, we knew it was kind of happening, a distin
ction between our working Jews and non.  So 
some thing we started worrying about it.  This is 
the same time when the German came in and he 
told my neighbor that some thing is going to happe
n.  So, I decided that I am going to go and hide 
some place outside of the ghetto.  Now, it wasn't  hard to get out.  It wasn't hard to move out, 

some  e mpty home s were outside of the ghetto.  So
 we went out during  
the night and we  were 
hiding.  It means me  and my fa mily.  My fa mily 
is now my mother andth
ree sisters.  We were 
hiding in a house outside of the ghetto, and 
the next day on November 14, 1941, that Aktion 
started.  At eight o™clock they Œ  a group, a big 
force of Nazis came in in
side the ghetto and they 
pulled out 10,000 me n, wome n and child
ren, in the same  thing the talk was, they were going to 
take them out to slave labor.  And the same  thi
ng.  People had no idea, because at that time, if 
you would hide in any parts of the house, underthe bed Œ  some  people were hiding under the 

bed Œ  they could survive this particular pla
ce.  So, you know the people we re so unprepared, so 
not having any kind of idea that they are going to
 take out 10,000 people to kill.  They were 
almost ready to be taken, to go away.  It wa
s no resistance.  And I can understand why the

resistance wasn't  there, because it was unpreceden
ted to know that they were going to take out 
people to ki ll.  So, people went and fr om eight o™clock the same  thing until four o™cl oc k or three 
o™clock, they killed 10,000 people, in not too far aw
ay, I forgot the name  of the little village of 
the place Œ  Chepelevo, they took out 10,000 people, Jews
.  They killed them right there.  In fact, 
the night before they took 100 people, the same  
thing on slave labor, to 
dig the pits, and these 
people never returned.  They killed them right in 
the place, and they neve
r returned back to the 
ghetto.  So, nobody had any idea.  
It was pretty secretive, pr
etty known, you know, and this way 
they killed this tremendous amount almost half
 of our population.  So, we started working, we 
got much more involvedŠ 

 

03:30:49 

 

Q:  Wa it, before we leave this Œ you Œ  your mot h
er and sisters were all hiding outside the ghetto, 
did you hear, you couldn't  hear anything? 

 

A:  No. 

 

Q:  How long did you stay out? 

 

A:  Only one night.  We  stayed only one night , and after the Aktion was over, the next day we 

returned back to the ghetto, and by that time  we 
l ost everything, a lot of my friends, a lot of my 
fa mily.  Then a few days later, it was known they
 were taking out, not too far from the city, and 
they killed them.  Because some  of t hem surv
ived the massacre in the pits, so they came, 
wounded, they came back to the ghetto and they were
 in the hospital.  We
 had a hospital in the 
ghetto.  So, the Germans, after they found out that some  people survived, they came in with a 

truck and took all the people from
 the hospital, and they killed 
them.  So, it was already known 
in the ghetto, when they took out the 
10,000 people and they killed them.   
 

03:35:34 

 

So, I returned back a day later a
nd by that time we didn't have th
e experience to know yet, but we 
figured the Aktion is over.  There's no place, we
 couldn't hide.  We couldn't stay much too 
longer, any place anyway, because the Poles would gi
ve us out.  So, we returned.  We felt safer 

to go back inside the ghetto than staying outside
.  And we returned, the next day we returned 
back to the ghetto, and here we 
found half of our friends, family 
were killed.  I got much more 
interested in our bringing the underground organi
zation, but at the same time I™ m unfortunate, I 
already lost already some of our 
friends, some  of my friends were taken out.  But we were still 
left over, a nice group.  So, we started meeti
ng mo re often, and planning and see how we can 
bring in arms to the ghetto.  So, I found a job i
n, I found a job in slave la
bor outside of the ghetto 
where they collected arms, Russian arms, which we
re left over when they were running away.  
So, the Germans were collecting it in three build
ings and they called it 
a Beutelager.  For me  
being, knowing a little bit mechanical work, so I got 
the job to be able to work in this warehouse.  
And some of my friends, the ones from the underg
round and the forema n was the father of my 
friend Choraszansky.

 He was in charge of that section, and he work
ing for there quite a whil
e, he established a good 
relationshi p with the two German
s, t he ones who were in charge of it.  They were German 
officers.  One was his name  was Brown, and 
Mutz, Mutz and Brown.  And what was the 
bartering, what was the business that
 we could handle, we could do with them is, he used to take 
out some  clothing or some  valuables, it could be
 watches or some thing else, and in return he 
used to get from Mutz or Brown, he used to trade him for soap.  Now, this soap used to come  in 

wooden boxes, small wooden boxes stacked up with so
ap.  So, what we did is we took out the 

layers, right on the bottom layers, 
we put in some  hand grenades, 
all different parts of arms , on 
top we put back the soap, naile
d back the box.  Now, how do you 
take them inside the box of 
soap?   So what we, what Mutz, ma inly Mutz was 
doing it, so Mutz with hi
s truck used to deliver 
back to sl aves, us the Jews, back to slaves to the 
gate in the ghetto.  In fact
 with this he used to 
drive inside the ghetto because everybody knew him.
  He was there every single da y picking up 
the laborers back and forth, and they knew him, 
s o it was nothing a German comi ng in with this 
truck.  They didn't check his truck.  They didn't 
look in anybody.  So, this way we could come  in 
together with him and they didn't check us.  And this way we had a good chance to bring in Œ  

actually, what the Germans 
did the job for us.  They brought in the arms  for us there inside the 
ghetto.  And it didn't take  too long.  We had a fe
w rifles, we had handguns, because a rifle takes 
a little more, it was a cut off rifl e, we put it in th
e sack of flour.  We  did 
it not only with soap, but 
we had flour when they brought in.  And we even 
had a radio.  The radio, what kind of radio is 
we took out from a tank, a broken tank.  We  took 
out the radio and put it
 some way together and 
we could get news.  Now, the ghetto had no comm
unication with the outsid
e world, or even with 
no place.  We had no newspapers.  We had no radi
os, and be fore you went into the ghetto they 
took away from you everything.  You were not allo
wed to have no bicycles, cars, we didn't have 
any cars to start with.  No tele
phones, no radios.  So, actually we
 are in a vacuum.  We didn't 
know anything of what's happening any place in
 the world, any place even our neighboring 
cities.  If Aktions of killings were happening 
in different towns, we had no idea.  We  didn't 
know.  We  didn't know.  It was just like a jail.  It
 was a  jail.  We had 
no idea what's happening 
from one place to anot her.  Not talking from fart
her away like Wa rsaw and Berlin, but even in 
the small towns next to us, we had no idea wh
at's happening unless, unless once in a while 
some body r a n away from the ma ssa cre and they came 
in the town and they tell, is the only news 
you could find out.  And that's  the way our 
organization was devel
oping, but we had less 
me mbers.  How ma ny me mbers we had, we don't 
know.  Our imme diate me mbership was, well 
we usually probably had 10 or 12 and then we lost
 a few, so we had about nine, 10 me mbers put 
together.  And right after the ma ssacre, life turned
 back to normal.  We  ca ll it norma l.  Now, we 
have a different way of what norma l life means, but
 being the ghetto, we call 
that for us, it's quiet 
and I lost that job.  They didn'
t let any more people, and I remember the night him and I worked 
in the Beutelager.   

 

03:43:28 

 

I reme mber the night of Pearl Harbor.  It happ
ened.  We heard it by the Germans that the war 
started in America and so the hopes kind of helped
 us that maybe some  help would come  from 
America.  And at the same time we were talk
ing between each other, ma ybe the world will fi nd 
out, help will come , but it never came .  How coul
d Russia, America, England, how could they let 

to take people, take people and just kill them out
, or destroy a people, but help never ca me .  So,

the underground was going on, but I ha
d to still ma ke a living to 
support Œ  I am now the head 
provide of my household.  So, I found anot
her job.  My job was in Verpflegungsamt
17
.   
 
03:44:52 

 

It means a big warehouse where they'r e giving out f
ood to Œ  we'd call it to older Germans.  It 
could be We hrmacht it could be Nazis, it could 
be rations to anybody who was Germa n.  So, one 
day they came  and they picked 300 people from 
the street to unload a big transport of food, 

because that's when they opened up at that time, 
this particul ar warehouse.  So, they picked up 
300 me n, because they needed it real fast unloa
ded.  And the warehouse was almost a block long 
right on the railroad tracks.  A
nd I was one of them.  So unloadi
ng it, I could see its a good job.  
It's  nice, it was food, it was only with food, all di
fferent kinds of food, eve n big like a tire of 
swiss cheese and wines and everything were th
ere.  So, some thing was going on they were 
talking that they mi ght pick some  of the people 
to have a steady job.  S
o, I tried to be young and 
strong and not hungry completely yet, so I worked 
like a slave that particul
ar two days, and I was 
probably one of the best workers, and they pi
cked me  by the end.  I was one of eight people 
where they picked on this particul
ar job. And after the third day, I 
had a steady job.  It was a very 
good job.  I could support my fa mily.  I could br
ing food.  They gave me  food.  It was a well 

paid job.  I worked there in this 
particular place until I got an orde
r to go out to the underground.   
 

03:47:24 

 

It didn't take long, in a short whil
e I got an order to go to come to
 a special place to go to the 
underground.  In this same  ti me , I reme mber probabl
y it's in this same time when it happened is 
Œ  a one of the me n when they took out the firs
t time the 1,200 me n and killed them, was a friend 
of mi ne, and he lived about a c
ouple doors away from us.  So, I we
nt to visit his Œ  no, no they 
took out his father, mi stake not Œ  
he was still there.  His father 
was taken out on this particular 
day.  So, I came  to visit my friend, and next door
 I saw a nice beautiful girl, so I asked him, 
ﬁ Who is the girl?ﬂ  And he said, ﬁShe lives ri
ght here next door to
 me , if you want it I'll 
introduce you to her.ﬂ  That was the same girl
, the one I still know up until now.  It wa s Lisa 
Nussbaum t hat was her name , and I got acquainte
d with her and saw her and start comi ng in 

every single day.  The only thi
ng I had a little 
bit problem because she was very young.  She was 
not quite 15, and her father didn't like it so muc
h.  By that time, Lisa was Œ  her mother was 
killed in that big Aktion, so her 
father didn't like it that I was such an often visitor comi ng to the 
house, but I had a very good job, and I had food w
ith me , and I had cigarettes with me and I had 
dry food what I used to bring 
from the Verpflegungsamt.   
 

03:50:18 

 

It gave me a chance to br ibe hi m off, with the 
food, with the ci garettes.
  And so, every time I 
used to come  in, I used to bring in my pockets 
some  dry foods, a package 
of cigarettes, before, it 
didn't take too long, I was a nice, friendly visitor.  This way I was comi ng in more oft e n, and I 

got to know Lisa, and she was a very beautiful girl. 
 She had longer hair with Œ  curly hair with a 
longer face and I almost fell love in with her, 
but not quite yet because right from the beginning 
here I am ge tting an order that I ha
ve to go to the partisans.  I ha
ve to go.  That was my dream all 
                     
17

the time  to go to the underground.  But it was just
 the beginning when I started knowing Lisa.  
So, it wasn't  such a big Œ  I mean objection for me . 
 

Q:  How did the order come  to you?  

 

A:  The order came to me in very simple wo
rds.  Some body came and told me  ﬁAron, tomorrow 
at six-thirty, seven o™clock you come  to this 
particular home.ﬂ  And the house was inside the 
ghetto, but almost by the end next to the wires. 
 So it came the order that
, ﬁtomorrow six-thirty, 
seven o™clock you're supposed to be 
there.ﬂ  No questions asked.   

 

03:52:02 

 

I went home .  I took my little knapsack and I put
 it in some thing over there, I don't know next to 
a shirt, pants, if I had anyt hing, and I go to my
 place where I was supposed to me et.  My mother 
and my sisters notice that I'm going away. I'm packing up and I™m going someplace.  They 

weren't so excited with that.  Here I am the head
 of the household.  They need me  so badly in the 

house, bringing in food, helping them with the 
rations, and the only ma n in the house.  I'm 

leaving.  So, my mother followed me  and she ca
me to the same house.  And being over there I 
am meeting some of my friends and some othe
r new people that I didn't know, other people, and 
the door opens up and my mother come s in and sh
e falls on her knees and she starts crying and 
she starts begging, ﬁHow could you do it and leave us
 by ourselves?   You're going away.ﬂ  Now, 
that was not typical of the other people.  Othe
r families were just the opposite.  The mothers 
would take the kids and throw them out on the street, ﬁGo ahead, ma ybe you'll survive.ﬂ  My 

incident  was different.  It took me  a long, long ti
me  back until now, how much, if I did the right 
thing or not, and ma ny times I could never forgive 
when I didn't  take this opportunity to go to the 
underground because some  of my Œ anyway I turned
 back and I went back with my mother.  I 
went back ho me.  Until the other things happened, but I coul d never forgive myself, my mother, 

I don't know, I could never come to terms with that. 
 Did I do the right thing?
  I didn't, for saving 
my life I didn't  do the right thing.  The way my lif
e turned out, it was all 
right, but that was one 
of my worst Œ anytime when I ta
lk about that, it's a very, very 
hard decision to come  up and 
decide.  But being the head of the household Œ so
 being the head of the household worked very, 
very hard on me .  Maybe if she wouldn't have 
me ntioned that word, ma ybe
 it would be different, 
but saying that the father was ta
ken away and you're the only one, so I turned back and I went 
back. Œ Slonim.  I never had another opportunity, ne
ver had a chance to go.  Some  of my friends, 
they did go.  They run away, they survived th
e war.  Some  of them were killed in the 
underground, but here I had a chance,
 yet I went too much, much mo
re aft e r that, but here I had 
the chance to be in a fighting unit and go out of 
the ghetto, and I didn't take
 it.  It took me  ma ny, 
ma ny years to rationalize if I did the right th
ing or not.  I went back in the ghetto.  My 
relationshi p with Lisa Œ  well in 
this way Lisa helped me a lot, because by that time I developed 
a relationship with a girlfriend and I lost some  fr
iends, but I gained, in that time, I gained with 
Lisa, and our relationship develope
d much closer and the visits we
re often, and that was going on 
until the terrible day of June 29, 1942.   

 

03:57:31 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0299

That's  a new chapter where it starts there.  A
bout that time  our organization was almost Œ  we 
lost more people and some  people went away andI was kind of like almost like rejected because 

not going to the underground, so I was left over almo
st like not faithful or not being part of the 
underground, and until the day of June 29, 1942.  It
 was only six months later from the first 
ma ssacre.  Here was lots of luck with me , lots, lo
ts of what happened with me  in this particular 
time.  Being a worker, a good place to work fo
r the Verpflegungsamt, I too had developed a 
relationshi p with the Œ well, I can
't  call them Nazi s because this was the Verpflegungsamt, so I 
developed a good relationship with 
the two officers, the two captain
s of the Œ  there were five 
Germans there.  There was man by the name of 
Captain Miller, Captain 
Br auer, and then one 
was a Fritz, I don't reme mber exactly the three ot
her plain soldiers, the ones that we were 
working with.  So, we were working, the eight of us inside filling the orders and the Germans 

were in charge.  So, we took it over Œ  it was 
Œ  we took over the old warehouse and we did our 
job.  We did a good work because we wanted to save our job.  It wasn't  so much the dedication 

of being dedicated to do their 
slave labor, but that was our 
only source of our good source of 
bringing in healthy families and having enough 
food.  Until that particul ar day, a special 
Einsatzgruppen group came  into the city with many, ma ny Nazis with trucks came in the day 

before in the city and ma inly they 
all need their rati
ons, their food.   
 

04:00:30 

 

So, where do they come ?   They came into that 
Ca ptain Miller, and that was on a Sunday.  So, 
they came into him to get some rations.  Meanwhile, fr om the time fr om the fi rst massacre to the 

second ma ssacre, everybody in the ghetto realiz
ing what happened the first time, if you could 
hide under the bed, if you could hide in the hi di
ng place, ma ybe they didn't  find you.  So, what 
happened was each house tried to ma ke ma lines
18
.  The name of maline they called it, it's a 
hiding place.  Now, a hiding place 
could take any different kind of 
ways.  It could be a tunnel in 
the backyard Œ  if you had a backyard Œ  with
 a covered entrance where they couldn't find.   
 

04:02:14 

 

In my house , in my hous e, we had 32 people li
ving.  And we ma de a hiding place for the 32 
people.  Wh ere was the hiding 
place?   Under the floor Œ was 
a wooden floor Œ we pulled out 

some  dirt and luckily we had a small yard, and pu
t it out in the yard, and we ma de in the floor a 
special entrance which was hard to recognize.  That
 would be the place to 
hide in case another 
Aktion would come .  We  knew it was going to come . 
 Now, e very other house had their different 
ways how to ma ke where to hide.  So, I was wh
en the news came  in the ghetto the day before, 
that some thing was going to happen.  How did th
e news come in?   The traffic outside you could 
see.  All of a sudden some new faces, some  ne
w t r ucks because we were on the watch- out.  
Everything we were looking for 
any signs and all of a sudden you 
could see the atmo sphere was 
different outside than everyday.  So, the truc
ks are passing by, and by the way, our ghetto was 
divided, the main thoroughfare, all the trucks 
had to pass by.  Was one 
ghetto on one side, the 
other side you can walk on the street, but you 
could see if they could go around in different 
places, but so me  Aktion was comi ng through.  So, 
we were getting ready 
to Œ  if some thing 
happens during the night or the next day Œ  we were
 getting ready to hide in
 this particular hiding 
place.  So, he re, they came  to Miller with the 
or de r for food.  And especially they wanted the 
                     
18

whiskey.  They always did it with the whiskey to
 get them drunk.  They could do the job without 
being drunk, but it helped when you gave them the schnapps,  the whiskey.  So, they came in for 

the order, and Miller said, 
ﬁI cannot do it unless you give
 me  my eight Jews.ﬂ   
 

04:05:12 

 

So, now we are his eight Jews, because they work
 over there in this.  The head of the commander 
had to get a special permit to be able to go inside
 the ghetto, I mean to get out that Miller should 
be able to come  into the ghetto and take out 
the Jews.  I don't know they were negotiating that 
what they told us later on. They
 were negotiating almost all part 
of the evening and the next day, 
on Monday morning about six-thirty, Miller and th
e other four Germans were living right across 
the street from the entrance of the ghetto.  It 
was a nice rich Œ  before the war, it was a nice 
Jewish home, so they took it over 
when they threw the Jews inside the ghetto.  So, Miller comes 
in to the entrance of the ghetto 
and he gives the order, shows th
e order to the guard and to the 
Jewish police.  The Jewish police were inside th
e ghetto, to get Dereczynski Œ  that's  me  Œ  and 
the other people, get them together as fast 
as they can -- 10 mi nutes, 15 mi nutes -- to come  
everybody by the exit from the ghetto.  And the ghetto wa
s small, it wasn't  that far.  I get a call in 

my house when the Jewish policema n knocks on th
e door.  We were already ready to hide, and 
he runs and he knocks on the door when he cal
ls, ﬁMiller is wa iting for you outside of the 
ghetto,ﬂ otherwise I would never go out.   

 

04:07:09 

 

He knocks a few times.  He said, ﬁDereczynski
, Dereczynski, Miller want s  you.ﬂ  And he 
me ntioned Miller, otherwise I would never come  out
.  So, I went out and he
re he tells me that 
Miller was giving me  the order to get the people. 
 So, we got the people to
gether and we went in 
the house and it was very hard leaving everybody there.  Here I am going out, but this time, I 

didn't have no hesitation.  It was very hard to part that you are going away.  I don't know if you'll 

ever get back together.  But I 
did go out, and five mi nutes to se
ven we were there and Miller 

takes us out and walking out from the ghetto, no
t going even ma ybe one block we could see that 
the destruction of the ghetto is comi ng, because we
 saw like a front line.  Germans wi th machine 
guns all surrounded the area that we are passing, a
ll pointed to the ghetto. 
 Like you see a regular 
front line.  Now, what is that for?   Then we wa
lked out another short while, a few mi nutes later, 
we hear a shot and the Aktion started exactly at 
seven o™clock.  By that time, the Judenrat was a 

ma n of one.  His name  was Kwint
19
, and the mi nute they started comi ng into the ghetto, he asked 
them, ﬁ Whe re are you taking my Jews?ﬂ  So, he wa
s killed right there by the entrance.  Kwint 
was killed right there by the entr
ance.  I found it out late
r, I didn't see it.  
But I could hear the 
shooting and then small little tanks immediately 
you could see because we  saw little tanks and 

trucks filled with all different 
ki nds of auxiliary forces was st
anding in the trucks, and you could 
see they'r e getting ready.  In fact, one come s out on the way when we were walking.  One high 

German offi cer come s out from a jeep and he 
stops us and he says ﬁWhere are you taking the 
Jews?ﬂ  In fact he if I™m not reme mb er, he may have even called him ﬁMiller.ﬂ  He said ﬁWhere 

are you taking the Jews?ﬂ  He said, "If you're not 
giving me  the Jews, you won't have  any food.ﬂ  

And, ﬁHeil Hitlerﬂ and he let 
us go.  And they took us to the Verpflegungsamt, which was 
approximately one mile away and we came back to the Verpfl egungsamt and in the

Verpflegungsamt you could already see the fire, you could hear the shooting and the killing was 
going on, and before the evening came they put 
the ghetto on fi re, because they couldn't find 
anybody.  Most of the Jews were in the hiding places, so they put the ghetto on fire.  So, you 

could see the flames of t he fire 
and we are sitting inside the Verp
flegungsamt.  Not be able to do 
anything, not be able to help and not sure with 
our own lives.  ﬁ What are 
they going to do to us?   
When they get through with them, they'r e not going 
to let us witness, sure
 the next thing will be 
they'll probably kill us.ﬂ  So, we
 tried to figure out ma ybe a way th
at we'll be able to run away.  
But, in that time , they gave us special scheins.   

 

04:12:14 

 

The schein was a small little card with
 a stamp from the Gebietskommi ssar
20
 Œ  it means the 
governor.  There was only eight legally taken out 
from the ghetto, and I was one of the eight.  
And here we are sitting there and Miller come s out 
and everyday we used to go to the ma in street 
where the ghetto is to the bakery to pick up bread
 for the rations.  This particular time, Miller 
said, I wouldn't suggest anybody should go, you could 
be caught right on this
.  So, I did with 
another two fellow workers we decided we were 
going to go anyway in the truck.  We 'll go to 
the Bakery.  Now, passing by the bakery is lik
e I say, you pass by two ghettos.  Another two 
ghettos a little inside that you c
ouldn't see.  I wanted to see what was happening inside the 
ghetto, so I took the chance.  I we
nt with the truck, and I passed
 by the ghetto and I could see 
what's  happening inside the ghett
o.  The ghetto was already on fi
re.  People were running out 
from the hiding places.  Some people were runn
ing out from the hidi ng places.  Some  people I 
saw where they were hiding in the toilets.  We  ha
d toilets, outside toilets, so they were hiding 
inside and they were all with th
e di rt, and they were caught there 
and they were out walking past 
by where it is running to the river.  The river was 
right there, ma ybe to wa sh off and they were 
killed right on the way.  And other killings, you could see some  dead
 people on the street in the 
ghetto, because the truck was going slow.  We  as
ked the driver, Fritz, when he passes by the 
ghetto to go slowly so we could witness this. 
 And it was happening li
ke people were running 
and the old Jewish saying ﬁfun fayer tzu vaserﬂ
21
, ﬁfrom fire to waterﬂ  Running from the fire to 
get drowned in the water or killed in the water, 
and that's the view what
 I witnessed it, what I 
could see.  And I came back to the Verpflegungs
amt, treme ndous thinking of what are we going 
to do.   

 

04:15:40 

 

ﬁHow are we going to survive or what can we do
? ﬂ   That was going on Œ  but the same  night he 
gave us a place to sleep in the Verpflegungsamt.  We didn't go back to the ghetto.  That was 

going on for two or three days, and 
then Miller told us that they
 are going to let a certain amount 
of Jews live.  They are not going to kill out the whole ghetto.  And later on we found out they di d 

the same  thing all over.  They 
never killed out in the first or
 second time until the end of the 
ghetto.  Our experience showed la
ter too, they did the same  thi
ng.  Mainly the ones, the people 
that are hiding, is you let some  other people live. 
 So, the people, the ones that are hiding would 
come  out and then you ma ke it from a ghetto of 
10 blocks, you ma ke the five blocks, from five 
blocks to 10 home s.  Then you keep them in th
e two home s.  Then when the Germans want to

find you, they only have two home s to look for it. 
 They don't have the 10 blocks, what they had, 
or 20 blocks.  I found it out
 later that that was wh
at was done in every type
 of place.  So, they 
left. They left, the word was comi ng out they were
 going to let some  Jews live.  It's not going to 
be completely liquidated.  So, what do I do?   I'm out
side.  My fa mily is still insi de.  Lisa is still 
inside.  I have no idea what happened with them
.  And I'm being there on the third day and I 
came to Miller, and I say, ﬁI have a good idea 
for you.ﬂ  And he, during 
the time with Miller, I 
bartered before too.   And he always used to as
k me if I could get him cer
tain different kinds of 
items to bring from the ghetto and he'll pay me  to send, probably send it back to Germany.  
Meanwhile, the night when this was happening, I no
ticed that Brauer, the other officer, he was 

kind of completely disturbed with
 the happenings.  It was only 
one German what I ever me t, 
what I could see that he was dist
urbed with it.  And I see him staying on the, on the Œ  we had a 
lot of sacks and he is staying 
over there leaned on the sack w
ith hands like this [i nt ervi ewee 
gestures with both hands on head] and he said ﬁI 
can't  believe it that my people can kill and burn 
this.ﬂ   And he was talking to himself.  And I ju
st make it like I wasn't  there around.  So, the next 
time, when a couple days later when Miller gave me
 the per mit, I told him, I said, ﬁYou get me  a 
permit to go inside the ghetto.ﬂ  The 
Aktion was still going on in the ghetto.

A:  After the second and third day, people were 
hiding inside the ghetto, and they could not find 
anybody, and they put the ghetto on fi re.  And the
n, a day later or two, they started announcing 

with the loud speakers that the Aktion is over 
and that anybody who come s out will get scheins, 
and they'r e not going to take them a way.  By th
at time, some  people were start already, comi ng 
out, so when they came out they immediately arre
sted them and they took them over in the jail 
yard outside of the city.  When I was worki
ng on my place and I found out that some  people are 
going to be allowed to live, so I went to Miller
 when I offered him a proposition that if he would 
some way get me  transportation to the ghetto, 
I would go inside the ghetto and find for him 
anything what he would like.  For 
example, he wanted all the time,
 he wanted Œ  at that time  
there wasn't  too much va luables you could find.  I 
mean if pe ople had small stuff they took with 
them whatever, but the bigger items
, crystals, all different kinds of
 dishes, maybe some furs, this 
kind of stuff.  So he fell for the idea and he
 says, ﬁAll right.  I'm going to get you a special 
permission to get inside the ghetto.ﬂ   

 

05:02:15 

 

In the afternoon, I asked him in 
the morning, a short while after, ma ybe an hour or two hours 
later, he came  back with a piece of
 paper, with a permit to go insi
de the ghetto and he  said ﬁFritz 
will take you to the ghetto.  He'll drop you o
ff right inside  the ghetto and whatever you 
accumulate all di fferent valuable stuff that you can find, you'll come  to the front of the ghettoﬂ Œ  

what's the entrance and the exit, it's only one ga
te Œ ﬁyou'll come  right by the exit of the ghetto 

and you'll take it over to my house.ﬂ  He lived righ
t across the street.  So, I was very happy to do 
it, and my intention was ma inly was if I could go 
ahead inside and ma ybe I'll be able to find my 
fa mily inside the ghetto, and Lisa, whatever I can 
do and help and see Œ ﬁI'll decide what I can do 
later.ﬂ  He dropped us off, four of us.  He droppe
d the four of us in th
e ghetto, and it was still 
going on some  of the Germans were still walkin
g around inside the ghetto to rob, to look for 
some thing to take it home , to rob, to take away.  And but in the same  time we are afraid that we 

shouldn't be arrested in taking like some  of the su
rvivors, so we all stay
ed together in one group 
with the document what we had.  So, we came, we
 walked through part of the ghetto and we split 
up.  Each one went to see if he could find anybody 
from their fa mily.  I immediately went to my 
house where I lived and I knew exactly the entran
ce or the hidden entrance.  I knocked a few 
times until I got an answer and sure enough everybody was still there, and it was the people that 

were there.  I found out it was 
32 people were hiding.  They open
ed up the door and it was three, 
we found three dead people.  The three dead peop
le they committed suicide.  It was a druggist , 
and he was fortunate to have some  poison, so his 
fa mily took the poison.  And the stench it was!  
I couldn't walk in, inside but some  way I went
 underneath and here the people were laying over 
there for three or four days under the floor with
 no lights and they couldn't even move.  They 
couldn't stay on their feet, if th
ey would come  out in the open.  
By some  way I got inside and I 
had a chance to see my mother and my three sist
ers.  I couldn't  help them with doing the taking 
out.  Whom would you take out?   If I could ta
ke ma ybe one, I would ha
ve a terrible decision 
even to take one.  Whom to take?  Whom to 
take?   And but I gave th
em, I found some  food.  I 
brought in some  bread and water.  The food that
 I found is because ther
e was some food in the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0299  
24 
 
empty home s where they took out the people.  I c
ould still find some  bread and what ma inly was 
the water.  So, I gave them the water and the br
ead and I gave them, and I said, ﬁWe'll see what 
we can do the next chance I'll have.ﬂ  I figured to 
myself ﬁthat's what I'll do.™  And I left them.  
And from there walking outside, 
I met my other friends, the ones that worked with me.   
 
05:07:00 

 

Nobody had anybody of their families.  Their fam
ilies were discovered and they didn't have 
found anybody.  So on the way walking out, I had to pass by the place where Lisa lives, the 

house.  And here, I tell my people, and they we
re carrying the dishes, whatever we found we put 

them in the pillow cases.  We didn't have any bo
xes.  We  put them in pillowcases.  So, I was 
standing over there and they'r e waiting and I say, 
ﬁGive me a chance, let me take a look if my 
friend is there.ﬂ  I came into the house, and she 
wasn't  there.  The place next to them was a 
hiding place.  It looked like the hi ding place 
was discovered.  And, you could see a hand grenade 
blew up the hiding place.  I still di
dn't give up.  I went to the back
 and I think, ﬁMaybe they went 

in the back to hide.ﬂ  So, I go in the back and 
I start calling out ﬁLisa, Lisa, Lisa, Lisa.ﬂ  And 
sure enough it, didn't take too long and an answer
 came out, and Lisa was there.  She was hiding 

in a small little shack, a wooden shack, very ea
sy to discover, very 
easy to burn, but some body 
was behind them upstairs and they kept the pl ace in
tact.  It was not on fire.  And she came down, 
and I ma de immediately my decision I ma de up, that
 I'm going to take her with me .  But how did 
I take her out?   Wo me n were not allowed to leav
e yet, because the people, the ones they left was 
only me n around them when they saw.   

 

05:09:05 

 

It was no wome n.  So, what I did is I went righ
t next door, in fact in the house where I me t my 
friend, the one who introduced me  to Lisa.  I we
nt upstairs in their litt
le attic.  I found me n's 
clothes, a pair of pants and a jacket and a cap.  
I took her in there.  I cu
t her hair, and I put on a 
pair of pants and a jacket on top of her old cl
othes which she had, and the cap, and she cried.  I 
mean, her hair she never cut since she was born 
probably, but she was happy and excited, and at 
the same  time she's leaving her brother and her fath
er in the hiding place, but she took the chance 
that she went with me .  Now, what I did was I ga
ve her my schein, the passport to leave the little 
piece of pape r and hoping in case if I'm caught
 Miller will some  way take me  out.   

 

05:10:08 

 

So, we'r e all getting ready to walk out, and we 
find a couple chandeliers, old broken things with 
wires.  I figure it's  a good thing to keep it how 
to ma sk her up, she wouldn't be recognized.  So I 
put on the one fellow, I put a chandelier 
with wires, we didn™t have much BX
22
 with, with all 
different kinds of wires.  The same  thing I did w
ith Lisa, and here we'r e walking.  There are five 
of us now with the bags and carrying the bags
.  We 'r e comi ng out to the exit and here the 
Germans are watching.  I take the piece of paper 
and say ﬁHere's my four 
men.ﬂ  And they took a 
look at us Œ they didn't even check Œ  look on 
the paper, four or fi
ve, they didn't pay any 
attention, and they let us out a nd we walked right across the stre
et, across the street where the 
Germans live.  We'r e comi ng in over there and Miller
 in the house, it's the mi ddle, or late in the

day, and Miller was in the house, so I walk up to M
iller, excited to join him with the bags of the 
goods that I brought him in, and I tell 
him I found my sister Œ  can he 
help me  to save my sister?  
He gets enraged and he hits his hands on the tabl
e and says ﬁThis is no place to hide Jews.  Get 
her out immediately.ﬂ  I had no c
hoice.  I put her down in the base
ment over there and I let her in 
the baseme nt and I figured ma ybe I'l l  be able to s
ee if I can talk to Bauer.  So, I wait for a while 
there, being over there and Miller 
took off.  He went back to wo
rk and Bauer was there.  So, I 
walk up to Bauer and I say, ﬁCaptain Bauer,ﬂ I 
say, ﬁI found my sister, can you help me ? ﬂ  He 
says, ﬁWhere is she?ﬂ  I said, ﬁShe's in the ba
sement.ﬂ  He says, ﬁDon't worry, I'll help you.ﬂ  
And he goes down with me  in the baseme nt and Lisa
 sits in the baseme nt.  It was filled up with 
old furniture, and she's laying like 
a little cat all rolled up scared to
 death and she was small.  She 
wasn't  a big girl.  And Bauer walks over and te
lls her, ﬁStand up.ﬂ  And she's scared and she 
stands up and he says, ﬁYou're not a boy.ﬂ  And he 
looks at her and so she just says, ﬁNo.ﬂ  And 
he says, ﬁDo you have your girl's  clothes? ﬂ  And 
she says, ﬁYes.ﬂ  He said, ﬁTake off the boy's 
clothes.  Take off everything that
 you have, and be back in your 
old clothes.  The only thing is 
don't have your the latte
23
, the Jewish sign, yellow star, th
e yellow square, round piece.ﬂ   
 

05:14:16 

 

Anyway, and he told her ﬁcome  up upstairsﬂ and 
there were Jewish Œ one
 of our eight that 
worked like steady.  He was clean
ing the house the Œ  for them a
nd helping them inside like a 
slave labor.  And he came down and they brough
t her down a babushka with her hair in a 
babushka and he took her out from there and he
 told her he says, ﬁI'll take you to the 
Verpflegungsamt.ﬂ  We  l e ft with Fritz.  Fritz took
 us over with the truck he took us back to the 
Verpflegungsamt and Lisa was left over there a
nd Bauer took her to the Verpflegungsamt.  He 
walked with her and he told her 
to walk on the sidewalk Œ  no more
 like on the street Œ  and ﬁjust 
walk like you're a Polish girl.ﬂ  And in case Œ  
that was his words, ﬁin case the Black Guard is 
going to stop youﬂ Œ  the Black Guard was the po
lice from the Ukrainians or some body with the 
forces when they come  in Œ  he said, ﬁI'm going to kill hi m right on the wa y.ﬂ  And he walked 

with her to the Verpflegungsamt.  I was over th
ere already with my other helpers, but I was 
expecting her to come , so I ma de a hiding place 
in the Verpflegungsamt.  I only had the problem; 
how do we bring her in?  We s muggled her in 
some way, inside, the other Jews that are our 
friends helped me  to find a place he re in the Verpflegungsamt and the Verpflegungsamt was 

hundreds and hundreds, ma ybe thousands of sacks 
of all different of flours and sugar, all 
different kinds of foods, and it was 
packed in five or six, stacked lik
e an army of soldiers.  So, I 
found a place where to Œ  I took out a few sacks, 
and I ma de a place to hide and that was where 

she was hidden there for a few days.  And then 
later on I got a schein for Li sa, the same little 
passport.  I was transferred to 
a different Verpflegungsamt to the 
other building to 
the Beutelager 
where I worked before.   

 

05:17:15 

 

We left that place where we could now live.  A
nd Lisa was left  over the night, for the night by 
herself.  And the place with f
ood with rats and everything right 
over there, and she stayed there 
during the night.  I came a couple times during the 
day to visit her until she got the schein and 
then after I took her over to the Beutelager.  Two 
days later she went to 
the Beutelager.  I went 
                     
23

back to help my fa mily.  I paid 
off Miller.  He came  in with a truck, Miller now, I came in with 
him, and we came to the place where my family a
nd the rest  of them were hidden.  By that time 
we found only approximately a
bout 14 or 15 people.  The young me n, the young people, walked 
Œ  went out from there.  I don't know if they surv
ived or didn't survive, but they left the place.  
We were in a covered truck with canvas, a canva
s covered truck.  I took out my fa mi ly and the 
rest of the people.  The rest of the people had mo
ney to pay him off.  The y had valuables.  They 
were pretty rich from before.  When we'r e ta
lking rich, we'r e talking ma ybe they had a couple 
coins.  But that kind of richness that we tal
k, we'r e not talking here for diamonds and big, big, 
big items, but it was enough because I promised 
Miller that, ﬁThey are going to pay you off.  
They are going to give it to you.ﬂ  So, I had to 
st and with my word, otherwise he could kill me  
too, if he would take hi m out and not get paid, he
 would take me  out and 
shot, because that same  
Miller was a killer before.  He took part in Ak
tions in different cities.
  We  found it out.  We  
knew it.  So, being good to me  this particular time
, helping me , it was me  Œ  it wasn't  Œ  the next 
Jew he would kill hi m cold in blood.  So, I was tr yi ng to ma ke it sure they will have money to 

pay him.  So, I took them over to the same place wh
ere Lisa was, but she couldn't be in the same  
building but next to it was anothe
r building, and they were hiding ove
r there,  staying there for a 
while.  The next day Miller gave them all sche
ins.  By that time everybody could get a schein.  
They could go out in the open at that time and ge
t a schein.  By that time  there was no more 
killing.  As far as I think and I'
m concerned there were no favors.  But that time was a time, like I 
said before, they decided they were go
ing to let some  of the Jews live.   
 

05:20:55 

So, it was done almost only to en
rich his pocket.  He knew it was 
no big deal what he did, but he 
did it anyway.  And we stayed over there Œ  by 
that time  there was left over approxima tely 900, 
1,000 Jews out of 20,000.  In a short time, we had ev
ery night to get up in 
the mi ddle of the night 
to be counted, but I ma de my way out from there 
to go to a different city.  I did the same  thing 
and Lisa did the same  way in two different time s.
  We were separated for a short time.  I went 
with my mother and three sisters. 
 In fact, Lisa, with her father 
and brother, left a couple days 
before.  Wh ere did we go when I left a couple da
ys later?   A friend of mi ne knew a farm lady.  
And the farm lady would take us in a horse a nd buggy to a different city
 with the name  of a 
Pruzhany name , Pruzhene
24
 and from t here we were going to go to the Third Reich.  We heard 
that in some  places in the Third Reich Œ  we 
didn't even know much about what the Third Reich 

meant Œ  that in this Pruzhana
25
, Volkovysk, Bialystok, Grodno, this pa
rt of the country that there 
is no killing over there and that th
e Jews are still alive.  So, we went with this farm lady.  They 
found her.  She took us in a horse and buggy.  She 
couldn't take us to Pruzhana she took us to 
Rozhinoy.  From Rozhinoy, they robbed us and t
ook away everything, whatever we had, and we 
went to Volkovysk.  In Rozhinoy, the woma n is 
supposed to take us to Pruzhana, so from 
Rozhinoy we got in touch with the 
Judenrat in Rozhinoy and they ar
ranged for us to go from this 
town to Volkovysk.  In Volkovysk we s
upposed to go to Bialystok or Grodno.   
 

05:23:44 

 

So, we'r e in Volkovysk in a place where some  mo re refugees were there.  I asked the pe ople in 

the Judenrat if you saw a girl with a young brothe
r, with a young kid Œ  her brother was 11 years

old, 12 years old, 12 years old not quite 13, because 
13, it was a year later, bar mitzvah Œ  and the 
father, the father was an older ma n.  At that tim
e, older was 50, he wasn't  50, but in the 40s was 
an old ma n.  And they told us, ﬁYes, a girl w
ith them and they went from Volkovysk and they 
went to Grodno.ﬂ  Here I am with my fa mily, 
with my mother and the rest of fa mily in 

Volkovysk, and I have to ma ke up my
 most i mportant decision in my life.  I had to ma ke the Œ 
and it flashed through my thinking, a backflash, ﬁD
id I do right in not going to the underground, 
going back to my fa mily?   And here I'm at th
e crossroads, should I go with my fa mily to 
Bialystok or should I go single,
 young and single go to Grodno? ﬂ  
And I made my decision that 
I'm going to Grodno.  It partly was my mi nd to br
eak away from the family, because if the only 
chance I have is to survive is not to stay t
ogether.  When you stay together you only perish 

together.  There is no wa y that a family would be 
able to survive, so I ma
de the decision that I'm 
going to go to Grodno.  And that's the last  time I saw my fa mily anymore.  I left them, and they 

went to Bialystok, and I went to Grodno.  Fr
om Volkovysk, was the place where we split up, the 

Judenrat helped me  in transportation to Grodno.  Ho
w did I go?   They put me  with a truck, a beer 
truck it was empty with empty kegs, barrels of 
beer that they were 
going to Grodno probably to, 
whatever, deliver or pick it up.  So, I was hidde
n between on the truck un
til I arrived in Grodno.  
And that too, the Judenrat helped me  to have 
gotten transportation.  I came in Grodno.  By that 
time I think it was in August of 19Š it was J
une, no probably in August of 1942, I came into 
Grodno.  Grodno was completely relaxed like hardly Œ  
it was a ghetto, but a very relaxed ghetto.   
 

05:28:08 

 

You could go in and out of the ghetto.  It was no 
killing.  It was no transp
ortation.  For me , it was 
almost like comi ng in like a paradise.  I'm sure Ak
tions happened to the time  but I wa sn't  aware, 

because I wasn't  there.  So, I can't  say that no
thing happened there anyt hing before, but the way it 
looked to me  Œ  comi ng in from the ma ssacres 
and comi ng in a place where it™s quiet and people 
are moving around and in the little ghetto you co
uld see business going on, on the street, what 
was the business?   Selling old clothes, selling a pa
ir of pants, buying a pair of shoes, you couldn't 
even buy food on the street in the ghetto.  So, for us
, for me  it was Œ  I couldn't even believe that 
things could happen not only what
 was it, 70, 100 kilome ters from
 my home town.  I thought to 
myself, ﬁI wish everybody else would know about 
it.  Maybe a lot of people would try from 
before.ﬂ  Well, it was going on like this.  I found 
Lisa.  Lisa was there with her father.  They 
lived in an apartment, and they took me  in.  I 
lived with them.  I made my own friends in the 
ghetto.  And my ma in purpose was only one th
ing is, ﬁHow do I get in touch with the 
underground? ﬂ   I'm single, I'm by my self.  Single, 
I mean I'm not ma rried.  I'm not attached, and 
that was a tremendous plus.  And how can I fi
nd a way with the underground.  The first thing I 
start looking to a Ha-Shomer ha-Za™ir, th
e Zionist organization,
 nothing helped.   
 

05:30:18 

 

Being over there I couldn't  get in touch with
 anybody.  After the war I found out it wa s an 
underground organization there.  But it was so se
cretive and being a stranger in town, it was 
impossible to get in touch.  So, here I am 
looking around, walking on the 
street to talk to 
different kinds of friends and pe
ople had jobs and this, and I could in no, no way I could get in 
touch with the underground.  So, in being there, 
by Nove mb er first there came in an order from 
the Gestapo to close the ghettos. 
 Ghetto one and ghetto two, they 
decided to close the ghettos.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0299  
28 
 
That means from now on the Gestapo took over th
e ghettos.  If you had to go in or out, you had 
to have orders from the Gestapo, and it was ge
tting on the same  order that Slonim wa s from 
before.  So, we are caught now with a population only one difference was, I'm an experienced 
person in people would have no idea what killin
g means or destruction means. I'm here, I felt 
myself, "I'm experienced Œ  young and experience
d, ma ybe I'll have a chance, find some other 
ways."  Whe n they blocked up the ghettos it was hard to go out for work.  You had special 

permissions.  People went out to work and it
 didn't  take too long they'r e asking for two 
transportation, resettleme nt started.  And the name  
was Œ  they are taking them out to work, and 
the places would be muc h better, because here 
already, hunger started.  A lo
t of people ran out of 
anything to sell or any valuables to
 be able to barter to change 
out.  You had to live only on the 
rations what you were getting, and that wasn't  
much.  Rations weren't too great, too big, too 

much.  And they were the orderto get 2,000 Jews for resettleme nt. 
 So, they put out officially 
signs, I don't reme mber, with name s or no name s , but
 they said, "Take your best clothes, take 
your warm c l othes, it mi ght be cold.  Take your
 toothbrushes.  Take you food for two days.  
Take as muc h as you can carry in 
the suitcase or whatever it is."  
They ma de us believe that they 
are taking you to a resettleme nt, but
 with my experience, I knew.   
 

05:33:52 

 

So, here I thought, "We are going to be the first on
es on the list, because we are the outsiders."  
And sure enough they came  to the house.  We  were 
first on the list.  I was 
first on the list, Lisa 
was the first, the whole family is.  But that's all I had to do was I was hiding in the baseme nt.  

When they came and looked for me , I wasn't  there. 
 So, they took other people.  They filled the 
quota with some  other people.  But I survived th
is first time .  And that way it was going on, day 
after day, quiet and then anot
her Aktion, and then another Ak
tion.  And meanwhile, we  start 
building malines, hidi ng places, the same thing as this and here I became an expert.  People 
started knowing of me , what I we
nt through, and now all of sudden 
they were getting interested, 
"How did you survive in Slonim? "  Before, pe
ople didn't want to hear it.  "How did you 
survive? "  So I told them this.  So, they called me 
in different places how to build places to hide.  
So, the one benefit that I got is I knew the place
s.  Helping them, I knew t he places.  So, when it 
came up a big Aktion when they took only four or
 five days, I was hiding, they took out I don't 
know ma ybe 10,000.  Now, Grodno had 29,000 Jews at
 this time.  The vic i nity around had 
another 10,000 Jews.  So, now I'm part of the 29,000.   
 

05:35:54 

 

So they took out one, one time, they took out in
 four or five days, another 10,000 and we were 
hiding in five  different pl aces.  We  were there, st ayed there for 10 or 15 mi nutes, "I don't  like it.  

Too ma ny kids, it's not enough air, its ma ybe it's
–," some way I had the feeling they were going 
to discover it.  And sure enough we went throug
h five days.  I don't know how we s urvived, but 

we did survive.  How we  survived the last time?
  The last time we survived after we went out 
from different hiding places and it turns out 
they discovered, I don't know
, not all of them, but 
most of them were discovered, but the last time 
is, we were hiding in a pl ace in a house under a 
bed, a broken bed, what the place was checked and looked ma ybe a 100 time s and that we 

figured that is a good place to hide .  Because 
by now they are not going to look under the bed.  
The doors were open.  The pillows and everything 
was all thrown out on th
e floors.  We figured 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0299  
29 
 
anybody walked in it only took a second to walk 
out, because they all realized that, "Hey, 
some body was here already.  Some
body before, they took out the 
people."  And we survived 
under the bed.  After that it was Œ  I do not know exactly how ma ny peopl e were left over Œ  but 
it was in December, I found a job to work outside 
of the ghetto.  In the meanwhile, being inside 

the ghetto where I lived, I befriended with a very d
ear friend.  He became a dear friend after, and 
his name  wa s Herschel Li pszyc.   

 

05:38:11 

 

And very nice person, very nice young ma n and he 
probably treated me  like a brother.  And I 
was so involved with him, and every place wher
e he was going to work, he was asking me , 
"Why don't  you join me to work? "   And here, it 
came out in December, he tells me, ﬁAron you're 
very handy.  Why don't  you be an el
ectrician.  We need an electr
ician.ﬂ  I was a carpenter, an 
electrician, a shoema ker, anythi
ng what we need.  When you'r e 
handy, it's not hard to become  
anything.  I mean, you'r e not an ex
pert at that, but at least you 
know how to do it.  And he tells 
me  that, " We need an electrician so ma ybe I can
 arrange that you can go out and they will hire 
you."  You can not just go with him and be an 
electrician.  You have a forema n, the forema n has 
to accept you to take you out over there  to work.  So, he went to the foreman and he told him, ﬁI 

have for you a friend.  He's an electrician, and he
'll go out with you. Let him come  to work.ﬂ  So, 

on that wintry day I went out to work with He
rschel, and we were working with about five 
people, and what we are doing we were remode
ling a house for a Gestapo, a private home .  So, 
we were remodeling the house, so I was supposed to
 be an electrician.  Before when in Russia 

when I went to school knowing about electric
ity, so I knew a little bit how to work with 
electricity, and being over ther
e we got acquainted with a Polish young fellow and his name  was 
Tadeusz Soroka.   

 
05:40:26 
 

He used to come  and the same  thing, to barter.  
He  used to bring us food, and we in turn would 
bring him clothes from the ghetto and change 
and this way we could bring in some  food.  
Herschel, my friend, knew hi m very much better.  
He knew him before the time.  So, he got real 
friendly with him.  My friend Herschel Lipszy
c didn't look Jewish.  He was a little blondish 
looking, so Tadek, this Polish fellow 
tells him, "I have a connections in Wilno and over there I 
will be able to get you papers, Aryan papers so y
ou'll be able to live as a non-Jew outside."   
 

05:41:39 

 

Herschel agreed to it with another friend of 
his Lutek, and they ma de their arrangeme nts with 

Tadek Œ  that Tadek is going to take them fr
om Grodno to Wilno.  It's 180 kilometers, he's going 
to take him over there.  They ma de up a certain 
time, and Hershel is supposed to send me a note 
if they come  to the pl ace, if they came safe 
to the place.  Because a lot times it was going on, 
some body c ould take away from you Œ  we didn'
t have any money, I didn't have much moneyŒ  
but to give out to the Nazis you would get a poun
d of sugar for it, or you would get some  other 
food stuff for it, rewards for it. 
 So, I wasn't  sure.  "Why would 
a Polish fellow just be so nice 
and do it for them? "   So we were kind of suspic
ious, I mean, whatever be
hind is or is it not, so 
we asked him for a note.  And Hershel left.  I 
helped Hershel get out of the ghetto.  I cut the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0299  
30 
 
wires for him.  I was the last one to say goodbye
 to him.  And we kissed and hugged and, "We 'll 
see you someday in Wilno."  And he left.  A few da
ys later, Ta dek come s to me  and he says, "I 
don't have a note."  He says, "It happened, he couldn'
t stay outside, he went inside the ghetto.  It 
started raining, and I couldn't stay long enough a
nd I have no note."  I worried about it and I 
didn't know if I should ever take a chance with h
im or not.  We went through another day or two, 
a few days later and Tade k cames Œ  come s again to me , the place where I was working, and he 
says, ﬁAron, the ghetto is surrounded with heavy 
guards and the ghetto, it looks like, is being 
liquidated.ﬂ  Here I have, I'm outsi
de, Lisa is inside, my fa mily is
 in Bialystok, I have to ma ke up 
my decision.  Where do I go?   Do I go Œ  do I 
believe Tadek or go back to the ghetto, live or 
there or go with Tadek to the unknown?   I didn'
t know where I was going to go.  I didn't hear 
from Hershel.  I didn't hear from Œ  what shoul
d I do.  So, I have an agonizing decision to ma ke.  
What do you do?   Do you go back to Lisa?   All kind of thoughts come  to you, and you say to 

yourself, ﬁ Aron, where are you running?   Where 
are you going?   What's  the big deal about 
surviving?  So you leave everybody.  And you almost 
give up inside."  And I'm not e a sy to give 

up, but your thought come s: "It's enough.  What is 
the purpose of surviving?"  You think and you 
think and meanwhile Tadek come s back and fort
h and he keeps asking me, ﬁAre you going? "   
And he says, "I'm going to take you to Wilno toni
ght.  Don't go back to the ghetto.  I'm going to 
take you to Wilno tonight."  And I say, ﬁTadek, I 
have no money.ﬂ  He says, ﬁI didn't ask you for 
any money."   He says, ﬁI'll take you to Wilno 
tonight.ﬂ  Meanwhile there develops another 
situation:   The other pe ople that  are working with
 me are getting suspicio
us Œ  maybe I want to 
go away with Tadek.  We are five or six, what
ever the figure was, we are going back to the 
ghetto, one mi ssing, that's death.  If you come  in 
with a piece of paper with six, and five are 
returning, that means death for the other ones. 
 They start worrying, the people, and all of a 
sudden I see like they'r e guarding me .  They ar
e staying behind me , but later on I don't blame 
them.  I would probably feel the same  thing.  
And I ma de my  decision, 'I 'm going back to the 

ghetto."  And this fellow, Tadek, stayed all day w
ith me .  He spent the whole day back and forth 
comi ng, begging me , and finally when I told him 
I ma de the decision, I said, "Tadek, give me  

your address and  ma ybe I'll have another opportunit
y, I will come  to me ."   So, he gave me  the 
address, what I ma rked down on my  body, on differe
nt parts of my body, I didn't want in case 
I'm  caught to give out Ta dek, and we walked back to the ghetto.  By that time it was seven, six 

o'clock in the evening.  It was dark, and I'm walk
ing with the rest of th
em, with a German guard, 
the one that took us in and out for work.  He was 
not a Nazi, but he was just
 a guard to take back 
and forth.  And I noticed Tadek is 
on the other side of the sidewal
k, the other side of the street, 
and he told me  be fore he left, he said, "Any
time  you decided to run away, follow me ."  And he 
was on the other side of the street walking up 
until I walked.  But I ma
de up my mi nd thatI'm 
not going to change my mi nd and I came to the entr
ance of the ghetto.  By that time, I thought to 

myself, "Goodbye Tadek" Œ  I couldn't  say it, 
but I thought to myself 
Œ  "goodbye Tadek, I hope 
I'll see you again."  The mi nute I came in, I was  a
rrested, like with every
body else.  A s mall little 
street.  We  walked down a small street right 
under the gun.  Your free
dom is all completely 
taken.   

 

05:49:21 

 

When here I was half free, outside half free, 
ma ybe 10, 20 percent free outside, ma ybe I could 

still do some thing.  Here I am back inside the ghe
tto.  They take me  into the big synagogue.  I'm 
pushed in the big synagogue, packed with peopl
e who they found during the day and the people 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0299  
31 
 
returning from work like me .  Everybody packed in
 the big synagogue.  I even had a hard time  to 
move around.  I was looking for Lisa.  I looke
d around, moved around asked some  pe ople what I 
knew.  I couldn't find Lisa.  And as sure as I 
stood there, "Why did you go back? "   I mean, now 
I'm caught right in the Aktion.  I stayed there all 
night and I tried to find a place to hide in the 
synagogue.  I found a couple places and I didn't 
accept it myself.  I thought, "They are going to 
discover it."  It was bookshelves 
Œ  a lot of bookshelves.  I was behind, I pushed out the books in 
hiding in the shelves, in the back of it.  I kind of 
didn't like it, "I'll be discovered and be shot right 
in the pl ace."  The next morning, about five o'cl
ock in the morning, the Gestapo comes in with 
the doors open, and we get an order.  Meanwhile
 already inside the synagogue they already 
killed a few by shooting, by Œ  they were shoot
ing on the chandeliers.  They synagogue would 
have the bi g lights and so me little children you 
could hear already, no me rcy, killings and I'm 
outside the other was in four, two walked to the tr
ansport and I'm sure this that's, now we see it, 
the way people are walking i
nnocent to the transports.   
 

05:51:37 

 

Now, here I'm a young fellow without a family, str
ong, looking from all sides where to run away.  

No way could I run away.  Any move  you would 
be shot immediately.  They keep postponing 
the time .  M a ybe it will be anot
her opportunity.  They'r e burni
ng inside, "Why didn't I go with 
Tadek."  And it didn't take too long, I'm at the rail
road station, packed with some  other people.  
They put me  in a boxcar, filled up with the boxcar
s, ma ybe 60, 70 people packed in the boxcar.  
The doors are shut.  I'm i nside, you can't even 
mo ve around.  People can't  relieve themselves.  
Hungry from the few days they were laying in th
e different places and here I'm between.  I still 
have a ray of hope when I see a small little 
window in the boxcar.  And with my other two 
friends, we were all together, the ones we were 
working together, and I say, ﬁLet's see if we can 
jump out from the boxcar.ﬂ   
 
05:53:31 

 

So some  wa y we had a hard time  to push through, that's  how packed it was, to push through in 

the boxcar and come  to that window.  We  ca me  
to the part where the end of the boxcar, where 
the window is, and we stood on top of each shoulders 
and we started with a
ll our strength to pull 
the bars, me tal bars.  Sure enough, we pulled the me ta
l bars out, because the strength that we had 
at that time  was like Samson with the pillars.
  We could probably br
eak a piece of iron.  We  
pulled out the bars and started jumping out.  I wasn
't  the first one to jump.  I jumped, the second 
or the third one.  By that time I thought, ﬁI'm 
a good athlete.  I know how to jump out.ﬂ  The 
train is going.  I'm already figur
ing out what I'm going to do.  ﬁI'm going to jump out with the 
train the way it's running.  I jump out I won't ge
t hurt.ﬂ  Sure enough it didn't happen this way.  I 
jumped out and I fell down, probably on the head
 or whatever.  I don't know.  I was unconscious 
and the only thing I remember is being awaken
ed by a guard, the ones who were watching the 
railroads.  The German guard picked me up, put me
 back on the truck, took me  back inside of the 
ghetto.  Inside the ghetto they put me  right in a 
small little room, and they left  me there in the 

small room, because they didn't know what to ma
ke the decision, to wait for the Nazis to come  
and ma ke the decision.  It didn't take too l
ong.  They took me  right to the synagogue.

They put me  back in the synagogue.  I'm back wh
ere I was the day before.  I'm pushed back in 
the same  synagogue where I was the day before. 
 But the only difference was it was empty.  It 
was about ten in the morning, the synagogue wa
s empty, and every hour the synagogue started 
being filled up.  During the day, th
ey found some  more people.  A
nd here I'm looking if Lisa is 
caught.  Yesterday I didn't  see he
r and today it's almost evening 
she is still not there.  The 
synagogue is packed up and they coul dn't Œ  I was 
looking a place where to hi
de.  I still have to 
find a place.  Maybe I can still survive.  And the 
only thing why I tried real hard this time  is 
knowing that Lisa must be still alive.  She's not 
in the first transport and she's not in the second 
transpor t or she's killed in the place or  she's out.  So, I was waiting all day.

Q:  Let's back up into the synagogue, you knew Lisa
 wasn't  there and you're still looking for a 
place to hide, and it's filling up. 

A:  In the synagogue, during the day, I'm still lo
oking around to see if I can find Lisa, and I was 
looking at other places, ma ybe I can find a place to
 hide.  It's  late in the day, the synagogue was 
already packed again, and Lisa was still not ther
e.  I looked around for a place, ma ybe I can still 
find a place where to hide .  And in the synagogue 
I was looking and I see a small little room that 
used to be the kitchen.  I jump in this little 
room, and I see a young ma n 
is ma king a hiding place 
under a pile of coal.  There was a pile of coal, bloc
ks of coal.  He was ma ki
ng Œ  trying to build a 
way how to hide under the coal.  I walked up to
 him and started begging 
him and asking him to 
let me make a place, together maybe we can make 
a place toge ther.  After 
a hard bargaining with 
him and asking him and pleading with him, I told 
him that I am a survivor from Slonim, I have 
some luck with me.   

 

06:01:45 

 

ﬁPlus, if you survive here, I have a Polish fellow that will take us to Wilno.ﬂ  I don't know which 

words worked on him, but he decided he's going to
 let me  ma ke the place.  So, we together, we 
ma de a hiding place.  Like we had two walls, an L shape and a pile of coal.  So, we used the two 

walls.  We  used like blocks, and with our luck 
we found a piece of plywood 
to make a roof.  We 
ma de a roof on top of the blocks, two walls 
of coal blocks and we ma de a hiding place 
underneath and covered the roof with coal agai
n, and we found a couple of bodies, two bodies, 
dead bodies that we put on top of
 the coal.  The bodies we found is a place where I wanted to 
hide the night before.  It was the same  room w
ith a large urn where they kept water.  So, I 
thought, ﬁI'm going to go in the inside and hide.ﬂ 
 And sure enough I walked out of it.  I didn't 
like it.  I thought, ﬁThe Nazis, that
™s all they have to do is shoot w
ith the urn.  He doesn't  have to 
go and look and check the urn.ﬂ  So, I went out 
from over there and that's where the next day 

somebody else took that place and they were killed
 over there.  So, we found a couple bodies in.  

We were hiding there inside, all of us, and duri
ng the night and the next
 morning, we hear the 
same  thing what's  happening the day before.   

 

06:03:39 

 

The Nazis came  in.  The y took out the people fr
om the synagogue, the same  orders.  The only 
thing is, is being inside the synagogue is empt
y and the echo in the synagogue you could hear 
real well.  You could hear only a few shot
s whether some body I don't know for ma ny reasons, 
but they left small babies.  And 
you hear the cry of the babies bei
ng still by the shots of the guns.  
And we are laying inside.  And after so much no
ise a few mi nutes before, all of a sudden the 
noise and the cries of th
e little babies are being 
all being quiet by the shots of a Nazi gun.  And 
we laid there the rest of the morning.  And the 
next morning we heard some  noise, because there 
was a room right next to a window. And we heard 
some  nois e  outside and the Nazis did the same  
thing.  The order was out.  They'r e going to let acertain amount of Jews to leave.  That time 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0299  
34 
 
approxima tely 1,000 Jews were left.  We jumped 
out from the  hiding places and they gave us 
three buildings where to live Œ  where the pl
ace where we were going to stay.  The three 
buildings were in the same place where I lived be
fore and I came  back to the place and there I 
was with this friend.  His name  is Ruby Loren the one who survived with me .  So, we Œ  all three 

of us ca me back to the place in the room to liv
e and half an hour, an hour
 later, who shows up?   
Lisa shows up.  She came out from the hidi ng pl
ace and she came to the same room with her 
father and little br other.  You can ima gine the 
joy that we found each other and here we are back 
together and we started our pl
anning how to reach Tadek, get 
connected to Tadek and go to 
Wilno.   

 

06:06:41 

 

I sent out, Lisa was the one to go out to meet
 Tadek because she was blonde looking.  She didn't 
look Jewish.  She went out, it was not too easy to
 go out from the ghetto, you go in and out.  It 
was plenty hard guarded, but some  way she ma de
 it.  She went out and she me t Tadek.  And 
Lisa's brother, he went out and ma de a contact 
with Tadek all account of my address that I had 
and they ma de a first arrangeme nt.   

 

06:07:18 

 

Lisa's brother and father went 
first.  He took them to Wilno.  And the same  thing on the train, 
loaded with tanks and ammunition. 
 And then came  to the time  for us and we ma de arrangeme nts 
with Tadek to go out, a certain time .  Lisa ma de 
the arrangements.  She went to him one time and 
then she went to him a second time and she me t him at church, and he told Lisa that, ﬁWe are 

going to meet you on a Tuesday night at seven o™cloc
k at a public washroom.  Meet me  there.ﬂ  
We followed his directions.  We  came out on a Tues
day night, but I want to turn back to one 
thing.  It's very important.  We  ca me out Sunday 
before, and we stayed in
 a janitor house.  We  
were a total of us eight or nine
.  The janitor didn't keep us, so 
he took us to bombed out house.  
And we stayed Œ  he didn't  keep us.  The idea was to stay in the janitor's house, and from the 

janitors house we'll ma ke a contact with Tadek 
and Tadek will take us out one by one to Wilno.  
That didn't work.  The janitor changed his mi nd and he forced us to get out of the house.  They 

wanted to let us out at 12 o™cloc
k at night.  He begged 
us and probably he wasn't  safe either.  So, 
he kept us until five o™ clock in the morning.  He took us to a bo mbed out house and there we will 

stay.  Lisa, he kept 
her over there.   
 

06:09:25 

 

That's the whole story with Lisa.  He kept Lisa. 
 For me , and  the rest of us, we stayed in the 

bombed out house, and then Lisa came  in the ev
ening.  But that day Lisa ma de a contact with 
Tadek, and she came back to the pl ace where we were hiding.  She knew where it was because 

when we we nt to the bombed out house, Lisa went 
with all of us, with the 
janitor so in case she'll 
need us, she'll know where we'r e hiding.  But the poi
nt that I want to ma ke here is Tadek came 
and said he cannot take us tonight
.  He ma y take us a day or two 
nights later.  We  could not stay 
one night outside of the ghetto.  It wa s more safer 
for us to go through the wires to go back in the 
ghetto and the next day to go back out of the ghe
tto and walk again, then 
to stay one day hiding 
in the outside. Because the population was so unfri
endl y and so Antisemitic that if a small little 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0299  
35 
 
child was throwing a ball fall into the place into 
the basement and then come home and tell him 
that Jews are hiding there we would imme diately be 
given out.  It was safer for us to go back to 
the ghetto.  That's what was so impossible for us 
to survive.  One day in the ghetto together was 
much safer than to stay an hour on the outside. 
 And we got in touch w
ith Tadek, Lisa got in 
touch with Ta dek.  The arrangeme nts were ma de 
that Tuesday at seven o™clock we'r e going to 
meet Tadek in a public washroom.  For that particul
ar Œ  it was very hard to get out of the ghetto 
that night.  We went out, 
five of us, knowing that he is not go
ing to take the five anyway, but we 
wanted to make the contact that if we leave ma ybe the othe r ones will go.  So, Ruby Loren and 

me  and Lisa and the other two.  We  all went ou
t and we were waiting at the public washroom.  
Lisa was waiting outside and the arrangeme nt wa s 
he was going to come  with a certain signal.  

He's going to come  and meet us at the washroom and 
then take us to Wilno.  Lisa talked to him.  
She told him we are five.  He said, ﬁIt's i mpossible.
  I cannot take five.  I can take two.ﬂ  After a 
real good talk, I walked out after 
two, he agreed to take three. 
 The third one was Ruby.  And I 
had a hard time  to talk Ruby to go with me  b
ecause he did not want to go with the two us 

because a girl is involved too.  And it's not safe to
 spend the rest of the 
time  to go anyplace with 
a woma n.  It's safer to be with two young people, pl us he had a cousin over there that if he felt it 

was safer to go with his cousin.  I talked him i
n, and I dragged him at the last mi nute to go with 
me . Tadek a greed and he took us to the rail
road station.  The other people they ma de 
arrangements to come  out two days later.  Two days later never came, because the ghetto was 

liquidated.  They could never ma ke it.  So, Ruby 
could never Œ  he would never meet his cousin 
and his friend.   

 

06:13:44 

 

How did Tadek take us?  We  followed Tadek, so
 Lisa was walking with Tadek, and now we 'r e 
talking about seven, seven-thirty 
in the evening.  We 'r e walking at
 night, and I look Jewish and 
Ruby looked Jewish, and every Pole would reco
gnize us, but we kept our caps down.  It was 
cold.  The cold, covered up with a jacket, and we
 followed to the railroad
 station.  We  came to 
the railroad station.  He showed 
us, ﬁHere, one of these trains is
 going to Wilno.  Ove r  there is a 
ditch.  Lie down in the ditch and 
I'll go find out with train is going to
 take us.ﬂ  He came  a short 
while later and was tellin
g us this train is going to go.  ﬁ Whe
n this train starts moving, jump on 
the train.ﬂ  He said, ﬁYou jump 
on t he couplers between the two tr
ains and some  of them you'll 
find a small leather where you can climb up on topof the roof, otherwise 
you'll have to ma ke it 
on top of the roof.ﬂ  And we followed his direct
ions.  The train started mo ving, I jumped out.  I 
found the coupler.  I found the leat
her, on top of the roof.  Ruby happened to do the same  thing.  
Lisa did not do the same  way.  What did she do?   
She panicked.  She was still sitting by the end 
in the ditch and waiting for the ri
ght boxcar which was going to take her to jumping on top.  So, 
apparently she ran out, and there was not too 
ma ny boxcars left, so she grabbed for the handle 

where the door in the middle of th
e boxcar and that little step.  
So she jumped on the step with 
the handle and the train started moving and sh
e's holding on.  We don't
 know anything what 
happened with her.  We 'r e on top of the roof.  
We  are doing our own.  And the train is already 
going 15, 20 ma ybe 30 miles an hour and Tadek come s to us.  He found us on top of the train 

and he said, ﬁ Where's the girl? ﬂ   I said, ﬁShe
's  probably on the train too.  She probably come s 
some place, some where.ﬂ  He left us laying there.
  He went all over the train.  He jump ed one 
place to another.  Now, this is March, I think the th
ird or  fourth, cold winter day, frost, real cold.  

In Poland, it's  a cold winter.  He is right there, 
and we are laying on top of the roof.  He's  left us

there and he jumped all the way on the train to lo
ok for her.  He found he r.  He came back to us 
and he told us we have to come  to one of the last cars.  We  like him, youth was with us.  We  
jumped like he jumped and we came to the roof
 where Lisa was hanging.  We  ma de a human 
chain.  Tadek bent down.  He was skinny and light.  
He bent down to be able to reach her.  I was 
holding his legs Œ  his feet.  Ruby was holding me , 
because it was slipper
y.  And we pulled Lisa 
up on top of the roof, and he gave us, after he gave
 us a little vodka, he had a little briefcase, he 
had vodka and bread.  And that's the way we travel
ed for 180 kilome ters until we came  to Wilno.  

We arrived in Wilno.  He told us before we come
 to the city to jump 
before the station.  We  
jumped out and we followed him Œ Tadek Œ  he was going ahead.   

 

06:18:41 

 

He jumped out before.  He told us, ﬁYou follo
w me  and I 'll take you to the ghetto.  You'll see 
people returning from the night, going to the ghe
tto, you'll some  way get together with them and 
go into the ghetto.ﬂ  We did the same  way.  
The only thing is we put
, on our faces, we put on 
coal.  Darkened our faces from the heavy day an
d night shift and walking on the street we saw a 
group of Jews going to the ghetto.  We joined them
 together and we were inside the ghetto.  We  
were in Wilno ghetto.  Wilno ghetto we found the 
same thing.  We found 
the quiet time and we 
were arrested by the Jewi sh Judenrat, the Jewish 
police, and they took us 
over to their office and 
they warned us.  That was Gens
26
 and Dessler
27
 Œ Dessler was the one I had a session with him.  
So he warned me .  He said, ﬁWe 'll let you stay 
here in the ghetto, we'll accept you.  We 'll let you 
keep over there, but we don't you should spread th
e rumors whatever happened to you.  We  don't 
want you to panic the ghetto.  
If you panic the ghetto, you'll be 
punished.ﬂ  Punished could be 
death.  He doesn't have to send me  to death -- he
 can send me  to death, he doesn't  have to kill me , 
but I knew Œ we knew what the me ssage was, not to
 spread the rumor.  Now, comes a different 
psychology what in the city was going on.  Just ma
ke little observations what I felt is the ghetto 
was being in a way being organized by the underground.  Quite a few youths who were part of 

the underground in the Wilno ghetto.  The war wa
s going on and the Russians started losing the 
war already by that time and Gens
, the head of the ghetto, had a 
feeling, a conviction that he 
mi ght save the ghetto.   

 

06:21:33 

 

People approve of that, that's a different case,
 but that was his thought.  The front is comi ng 
closer and if you don't provoke the Germans to liqui
date the ghetto he has a chance to save the 
Jews in the ghetto.  But at the same time th
e F.P.O., it means the Fareynegte Partizaner 
Organisatsye
28
, it means under one umbrella, all the 
underground, got organized and wa s two 
sections in the ghetto.  One was the youth in the 
underground and one the people want to survive.  
And you have to be one part of them.  We  were in
terested that time in survival Œ  I me an in going 
to the underground.  And now our survival can
 only go through the underground.  After a long, 
long time, I felt it long in our times, ghetto time,
 is finally we ma de a contact with the 
underground in the ghetto through Ha-Shomer ha-Z
a™ir, too, and I was working in the ghetto

with someone from Ha-Shomer ha-Z
a™ir and in this same  time  another friend of mi ne.  In Wilno 
we were a group of ten, what they called the Grodno Gruppe
29
, from Grodno, survivors from 
Grodno.  So, we were a group of ten.  We  lived 
together, most of us in one room, and we 
belonged to the same  nucleus of underground.  So, we
 got in touch and here 
we were part of the 
underground.  So, that was the first time since 
Slonim to Grodno being by 
myself I got another 
chance.  I got another opport
unity to join the underground.  
And here I joined with the 
underground and a lot of things were going on in th
e ghetto.  A lot of people were pro, a lot of 
people were against it, for the same  reas
on the underground provokes something with the 
Germans would come  and 
liquidate the ghetto.   
 

06:24:19 

 

So, we were very, very secretive and in fact 
we begged them, we insisted that we want any 

chance we have to be able to send us to the w
oods, to the woods.  And we went to different 
affairs in the Wilno ghetto.  There were treme
ndous Œ  ma ny happenings 
in the ghetto.  We had 
the Wittenberg affair, where the Nazis caught th
e head of the underground organization.  How 
they caught him is actually, they didn't  catch hi
m,  they caught a Polish leader, and he gave out 
Wittenberg
30
, and then the Nazis came to the ghetto and were dema nding to get Wittenberg.  And 
Wittenberg was the head of the underground, so it was going on the whole fight, should they 

give out Wittenberg or  not and one ni ght we got an
 order to meet in a certain spot, in the mi ddle 
of the night, 12 o™clock, we got an order to meet
 to defe nd Wittenberg.  And here we discovere d 
that the underground is not eight Grodner
31
 or 10 Grodner, but the underground is hundreds of 
people.  By that time  we had three guns.  Ou
r group was actually 10 so we  had three guns.  How 
did we get the guns?   We bought them thr
ough some body and some body smuggled them in.  
Was very expensive Œ  we  had to give up food to
 be able to buy, to buy 
the guns, but without the 
guns we probably wouldn't  be accepted to go to the underground.  Every group had to have a 
certain amount of speŠ guns to be able to go 
to the underground.  So, we lived through in the 
ghetto and going through and finally we convinced
 them or they were convinced by themselves, 
because it wa s going on.  Should we send me n to the 
woods or should we keep all the people, all 
the fighters in the ghetto and to defend the ghetto.   
 

06:27:32 

 

We were the ones that didn't believe in defe
nding the ghetto, because we thought the most it 
would do is kill a few Germans, but otherwise we 'll all be ki lled out and nobody will survive.  

Our idea was to go to the woods and fight in the 
woods.  They came to the conclusion too, that 
we couldn't do anything without th
eir conclusion.  And they deci
ded they are going to send out 
groups to the woods.  It was no easy thing to
 go out to the woods because it was 250, 170 

kilome ters away and to go to the woods you had 
to know where to do and this we'r e proud of our 
Jewish boys.  We  had two Jewish young fellows 
where they were in the woods, they were 
partisans.  They risked their liv
es to go back to the ghetto and ta
ke out 28 Jews.  Twenty-eight 
Jews like me  and take them to the underground.  It 
took us eight nights, seve
n nights.  It took us 
seven nights to go from Wilno to the woods w
ith two scouts who they knew the way.  We  got

lost on the way until we  found the road for a whole night inst ead of going 10, 15 kilome ters, we 
only went a few kilome t e rs.  We  stopped back on the same  way, but we ma de it all the way to 

the underground and we came there and th
e leader of our group was Glazman
32
 and he by the 
way, one of the people that I lived
 together with in Wilno, he 
left for the underground a couple 
weeks before and we didn't  know.  But when we came there, he was a Russian young ma n by the 

name  of Bumky Bojarski and he was a leader in
 the underground al
ready, in the partisans.   
 

06:30:17 

 

We me t hi m over there on the base not knowing. 
 We  was surprised to find him and he was 
surprised to see us, but that's  how secretive it 
was.  He didn't know anything about us.  Now, how 
was life in the underground?   We ll, the mi nute we 
came in were very happy days.  It was quite a 
few Jews and the idea was to form a Jewish sp
ecial unit, not be togeth
er with all the other 
nationalities.  We  wanted to be a fighting, strong
 fighting Jewish unit.  At the beginning they 
accepted it when we came, and we thought we had ot
her Œ  we were right with that.  We thought 
we had other things in our mi nd because all of us 
lost all of our fa milies.  The only thing, we all 
had one thing in common, is not survival, I me
a n survival was secondary, but revenge was Œ  

fighting the revenge was our ma in purpose.  B
ecause everybody feel th
e same  way.  If you'll 
survive, what's  the big deal?   Nobody's ar
ound.  Everybody's gone.  So, anytime when the 

commanders used to come  in and ask for volunteers
 to do all kinds of mi ssi
ons, we were the first 
ones, and we were good at it because like the rest of them in the underground with us, were 

Russian prisoners, some  Poles and some  far mer
s.  The farmers were forced to join the 
underground.  The Russian prisoners was part of thei
r life to survive.  They went to fight a war 
that families left, so for them I don't  say they 
wasn't  good fighters.  They di dn't have the motives 
what we had.  For us, we were young me n and wome n 
and we had the gall.  For us to be in the 
underground was to fight and do as much dama ge, 
to kill Germans do da ma ge the most we can.  
But Antisemitism was just ther e.  They lear ned as fast fr om the Nazis or fr om the Poles before, 

or it was ther e insi de for them it was natural to be Antisemitic, so they started making fun of us.   

 

06:33:56 

 

And the wome n they thought belonged only in the 
kitchen.  ﬁThey don't belong over there.  They 
don't belong fighting.  What does wo
me n fighters have to do?ﬂ  And the ma n was the same  thing.  
ﬁ What is a Jew?   A Jew doesn't  even know how to k
eep a rifle Œ  how to fight with a rifle.ﬂ  So, 
we had Antisemitism was pretty strong and we 
had incidents where Antisemitism was almost 
like in the ghetto because in the certain time
–.  Now what was our work to be done?   Our 
mi ssion was, the first thing was to blockade the roads comi ng to our base.  That's  whe r e you 

want security.  So, we blocked all the roads 
comi ng to us. We  cut down the trees because we 

were in the woods.  We  
cut down the trees on the roads and we
 dyna mite them so they could not 
come  into our base.  Now, the underground wa
s already developing pr
etty strong.  It was 
numbers, bigger numbers.  And I'm t a lking a
ll underground, not only the Jewish underground, as 

in general.  I'll come  bac k to the Jewish 
underground.  So, the area be
came already quite a few 
partisans, we re in the whole ar
ea and we cut down the telephone lin
es.  We cut down the bridges.  
We cut down Œ wherever we could do is blow up 
their railroads.  In ma ny instances we blew up 
trains.  Now, if I took part in it, 
I took part in it directly and indi
rectly.  But I wasn't  a hero but I

was part of the underground.  I was active as 
anybody could be.  Now, with the Jewish 
underground, the Jewish otriad
33
, more groups were comi ng in from
 Wilno.  One after the others, 
and then they decided to disband 
the Jewish separate unit.  So, th
ey left only a smaller amount of 
Jews to be together, take them in their units an
d then a larger group, ma ybe half, they put them in 
a different camp.  They ma de a ca mp for them.   
 

06:37:16 

 

They called it proizvodstvennaya gruppa
34
.  That means a camp productive.  They are going to 
produce.  They are going to work for the other pa
rtisans.  So, they took all different kinds of Œ 
they were Œ  or they ma de tradesme n out of them
.  It was shoema kers, tailors, ma inly bakers, a 
bakery to bake food.  They used to bring in the 
flour and bake food for the partisans.  So, they 
ma de the m l ower, on the same  level or they would put him back on the same  syste m, ﬁYou are 

lower class you're not good enough.ﬂ  And this was one
 of the best cream of our youth and they 
put him down to that kind of level.  But some  of 
them, but in fact most of them didn't stay there 
too long.  They some  way went out and they found 
in different otriad Œ  
in different companies 
special groups where they joined so they were st
ill able to go in and fight.  And they didn't take 

him in, in our group.  And this way was happeni
ng up until a couple months later we had an 
oblava
35
.  It means the Germans ca me  t o comb the woods.  Before they send the Germans to the 
front line, they gave him the test
 to comb the woods.  And that was a time when we lost a lot of 
people because there was no place you could survive or hi de.  They came  in with the force so the 

only thing you had to run away and hide in some  
places.  So, this particular time  I was chosen 
with Lisa, I was chosen to be gua
rds to the staff.  The staff for 
our otriad.  Otri
ad, is what do you 
call them, a big company.  The name, by the way, 
where we were was Kalininsky Otriad.  That 
was the name.   

 
06:40:03 
 

And the staff decided, they found out the night befo
re that oblava, is going to comb the woods.  
But this incident I have to mention it, it was the 
same  thing like in the ghetto.  The night before, 
the staff, we  lived in bunkers
, so they opened up one bunker and every Jew had to come  in the 
bunker and they searched us.  If anything th
at we had which we brought from the ghetto, 
some body had a watch, a golden watch, some bod y had other things, I don't know what.  

Some body had good shoes or good boots, they took aw
ay a good pair of boots, from me , I didn't  
have a good pair of boots, but they would take a 
good pair of boots from me  and give it to theirs, 

and leave ma ybe an old pair of torn boots or 
no boots.  And the same  thing is take away 
everything from you and send you out.  And that remi
nds me of the same s e
lection that I went 
through in the ghettos before.  And the next morni
ng they took the staff went and they took about 

10 people with them, and I and Lisa were part of
 the 10.  Our job was to protect them during the 

night when they go to sleep.  They put guard
s all the way around.  But this way we had 
opportunity to go with them.  We 
we nt with them through the night
, and then they felt danger.  
They released us.  They went on the far m.  They
 changed their clothes like farmers and we were 
left alone.  And we went on a sma
ll little island.  By luck we surviv
ed there.  It was not anything

special, but we survived on this pa
rticular pl ace, on an island.  And then after that, we came  back 
on the base, this oblava search 
was going on five, six days.   
 
06:42:54 

 

We ca me  back on the base.  We  lost anothe
r 20 percent of our good people and they took not 
everybody back in, being an active 
fighter, they took me  back.  Th
ey took Lisa back and Lisa 
was very well accepted, so she had less problems th
an some body else.  This way we were in the 
underground.  What we did, we had to fight, we
 had to attack some  garrisons with other 
partisans, with other groups.  Butthat was our life in the underground. 

 

Q:  So, you had arms? 

A:  Yes. 

 

Q:  So,  you went out and fought? 

A:  Yes, we had arms .  Even in the beginning we 
had very little arms, but then in months later, 

we had an aerodrome, what we ma de .  We  cut out
 a big field where the Russians used to come  in 
the mi ddle of the night, and we used to put up four
 fires in different parts and they used to drop 
ammunition.  And it didn't  take too long that we had enough arms .  So, the y had known from the 

beginning their excuse for the Jews not to take them in because we didn't have any arms.  Later 

on, there was no excuse.  We  had plenty of arms.  
There was no shortage of ar ms.  It was already 
so organized that we had planes
 landed and take out wounded and 
take them to Moscow.  So, it 
was real, real organized.  It help
ed to break the back of the Ge
rman ar my, because not only with 
us, but then it was going on for ma ybe I think 
the figures are, there was more than 1,000,000 
partisans, right?   I'm not talking about our area, 
I'm talking as a whole Russia and all over.  It 
was tremendous, big power. 
 
06:45:34 

 

Q:  What about food?   How did you get food? 

A:  Food was no big problem.  When we were in
 the woods with the partisans we were almost 
like the king of the woods.  The ki
ng of the area.  We used to go 
in the farm come  in with a gun 
at night and if they had food, we got their f
ood.  So, food wa s no problem.  But it was friendly 
far mers and unfriendly farmers, so we had to go 
farther away where it was unfriendly farmers.  

One more thing that I want to me ntion is our j
ob what we did. I think it was very important in 

our vici nity, we had Jews, singles and even some  of them were fa milies.  But they run away fr om 

ma ssacres and they were on the periphery of the w
oods.  Some  of the m hiding in farms, some of 
them living in the woods.  When we discovered 
them, we took some  of them, we took out from 
the woods and we put them in the farms and the 
farmer knew, ﬁYou have to keep him, you have 
to protect him.  If not, if we come  and–,ﬂ he
 knew, that was a language he understood.  You 
didn't have to tell him that.  ﬁYou have to keep 
him safe.  If we come  to your farm a nd we don't 
find the people, your farm is going to be burned,
 all your cow and your horseﬂ Œ  that was his 
ma in possession Œ ﬁwould be killed or taken aw
ay.ﬂ  The me ss age was clear.  ﬁYou have to 
protect them.  You have to hold them.ﬂ  They 
all survived.  Anybody when we got in touch with 
them, and we felt very good about it that we coul
d help.  We had fa milies living that we helped 
to survive.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0299  
41 
 
 
Q:  And the other partisans, non-Jewish 
partisans didn't prevent you from doing that? 
A:  They didn't  know. 

 

Q:  What about some of 
the leaders of your group? 
A:  Some  of the leaders, we 
had leaders from the beginning we
 had leaders that they dropped 
them by air, by parachutes.  So, they were Ru
ssians.  Some  of our 
leader was Glazman.   
 

06:49:05 

 

He was the leader from the F.P.O.  He was ki
lled for only one reason.  He didn't like what the 
Russians are doing with the Jews in our partisans.
  He was the head of our Jewish otriad, and 
after they took away all the power
 from us, he was terrible disgus
ted.  So, he decided he's  not 
going to stay here.  He is from Wilno ghetto 
to send Rudnisky, that's another wooden area where 
they send some  of the partisans went to Naro
ch, that's where we were, and some  went to 
Rudnisky forest, they called it pushcha
36
.  So, he decided he's going to take a group and he's 
going to leave us.  We  were part already of
 the Russians anyway.  There was no Jewish 
leadership.  They took away the Jewish leadership. 
 So, he felt he wanted to go to the other side, 
to the other group and on the way, he was killed
 with the group.  Only one young girl survived 
and she came back and told us about it. 

 

Q:  What did you think about the Russian partis
ans?   I mean, how do you feel in the end about 
the whole Œ ? 

A:  We  were very, very disa
ppointed for not having our own un
it we were blocked with ma ny 
things to do.  So, in kind of a 
way you lost your quest to fight 
your own way, but we did it in the 
same  way because our purpose was to fill out what
 we were going for it, but it took away the Œ  
how do you explain it, the morale.  
It didn't feel good.  But in the same  way, I would have to say 
that not every Russian was the same .  We  had frie
nds in the Russian who we
re just as us and we 
were friendly and brotherly the same  way like 
anybody else.  So, it's not a question Œ  we had 
bad experience with different t
ype of groups, but we had good peopl
e, we had nice people with 
them all over like the same thing like we met at
 Polish Tadek.  The same  thing we had Russians 
that were Œ  in fact by myself the Russian people are a ni ce pe ople.

Q:  Why did Tadek do what he did, do
 you think?  Or did you ever find out? 

A:  We ll, why he did is that's what he told 
us a few times.  You know Tadek?   We  brought Tadek 
to America and we are still in t
ouch with him.  He went to schools and talked to schools and he 
belonged to a Catholic school, the Nuns of Nazaret
h.  And he kind of believed he says Œ  and 
they asked him the question, and he says ﬁWhat el
se could I do?   If I see a person I can save 
especially I had friends that I pl
ayed with them before the war,ﬂ 
it wasn't  particularly us.  He 
said, ﬁThey were nice people and if 
I can help him why shouldn't I?ﬂ 
 He feels ﬁI'm not a hero.  I 
didn't do anything special.  I did what I felt a 
person should do,ﬂ  and what he does he blames,

ﬁIf I could only point my finger it™s to the pe
ople the ones that did not help.ﬂ  In Yad Vashem
37
 
he was speaking he say, ﬁI accuse the people 
the ones who could help and did not help.ﬂ 
 
Q:  We  have a little tiny bit of time left.  Afte
r it all ended you went back and what did you find 
and were there any pogroms a fter Œ ? 

A:  Yes, after liberation came  for us in 1944, th
e Russians liberated us in time of liberation we 
lost three of my best friends.  On the day of
 liberation we got an order to collect German 
prisoners.  We were caught out in
 the woods with a group of well 
trained army officers, because 
they were army officers and they Œ  with them, too a couple plain soldiers
, but the rest of them 

were well armed from the front.   

 

06:55:11 

 

They were already home.  So, we got the order 
to catch them in the woods.  And we fol l owed 
them and we  put a couple ambushes under them, so we
 killed quite a few of them.  That's what 
we know where they were and was wounded.  By 
the end when it came evening, they were well 
trained, they put ambush on us in a house in 
the woods and they ki
lled Lutek, Lazer and 
Benchke.  Three of my best friends we re killed 
already we were liberated.  From there I ma de 
my business to go back to Slonim aft e r liberation.
  I went back to Slonim and in Slonim I found a 
cemetery.  Nobody was left out of the 20,000 I could onl
y find two or three Jews were there.  For 
some  reason they came to check, to fi nd.  Nobody was there.  I had a woma n, I mean a neighbor, 

a Tatar Œ  Muslim and she was very, very friendly. 
 My father helped her all his life.  In time of 
the war we helped her, too, I mean before the war.
  And she's supposed to help us in time  in the 
war.  She did not.  We  l e ft some  clothes in he
r house.  We  thought ma ybe it's the place if we 
need we'll come  and take some  clothes and then 
trade it for food.  She did not give us in time 
when now we needed it and now, when we came 
after the war, she was very unfriendly.  I'm 
talking here about a person what 
her father and her family lived with my family for one hundred 
years, probably for ma ny, ma ny years.  So, anywa
y, I could feel it's like a cemetery.  I didn't stay 
there long.  I stayed only one 
night and one day.  From there I went to Poland.  From Poland, 
well Poland, I mean that was White Russian, in 
Poland, it's in the same  area but then it's an 
established part of Poland.   

 

06:58:11 

 

I went back to Bialystok, and in Bi
alystok I got connected to the B™richa
38
.  B™richa it was 
organization which was sent out from Palestine, th
at time, it was not Israel
 yet, so they send out 

Jewish young me n and wome n to save survivors.
  So, we got in touch with them and from 
Bialystok we  went to Lublin.  From Lublin we go
t directed to the B™richa to go try to go past, to 
the We st.  So, they arranged for us papers fr
om the Red Cross that we are Greeks and we are 
returning home  and this way we could ma ke the 
voyage from Lublin to Czechoslova ki a, to the 
border of Poland and Czechoslovakia.  So, 
we followed an underground railroad to 
Czechoslovakia.  We  went to Bratislava, Czechosl
ovakia, From Bratislava went to Budapest, all 
with the help of the B™richa, with the Jewish
 issue of Jewish organization from Palestine.

A:  In Slonim I was only for one day and then 
I went to Bialystok a
nd in Bialystok I got 
connected to the B™richa and the B™richa was an
 organization they one they sent out young me n 
and wome n to collect surv
ivors and then help them to go to
 Palestine.  From there we got 
directed to go to Lublin.  In Lublin we  got our 
Red Cross documents.  Wh at they helped us to get 
it, that we are Greeks.  It means Greeks are re
turning back from the Wa r.  They are returning 
back to Greece and this way was on the way we c
ould go in the direction to Czechoslovakia.  In 

Czechoslovakia we came to Bratislava.  From Bra
tislava we went to Budapest.  And Budapest 
we found right after the war what was going on 
they had fighting going on between Buda and 
Pest.  From Budapest with the help with the same
 thing the B™richa;  we we
nt to Graz, Austria.  
From Graz, Austria we went across 
the border.  We had to cross the 
border to the west.  And that 
was the place we had to go to the Alps.  And with
 the help with the B™richa, the same  way, we 
crossed the part of the Al ps and we came  to
 Tarvisio, Italy. Tarvisio, Italy, we too, were 
imme diately helped by the Jewish Brigade.  The 
Jewish Brigade was part of Jewish volunteers 
from Palestine in the English army.  So, the Jewi
sh Brigade helped us in Italy, and they took us 
with trucks to Bologna, from Bologna to Floren
ce, from Florence we stayed about six weeks.  
We  lived in Florence and with the he lp of UNRRA
39
 we were supporting ourselves.  With their 
help, we got food.   

 

07:05:00 

 

And there from Florence we went to Rome .  In
 Rome , Lisa got in touch with her she has a 
grandmother and uncles and I had aunts and uncles 
and we got in touch with America.  And our 
purpose at that time  to go to Palestine, by that 
time  the road to Palestine was blocked.  You 
couldn't break the blockade.  You could only go to
 Cyprus.  And we figured ma ybe we'll take a 
chance we'l l go instead of staying in Cyprus, we
'l l go to America for a year and then go to 
Palestine.  But that  didn't material ize.  In Rome
, I got ma rried, I got ma rried to Lisa in the big 
synagogue in Rome  and we came to the 
shores of America in 1947.  March 27
th
, we got ma rried, 
but I don't reme mber exactly a date in April we ca
me  to Ame r ica, and we settled in the city of 

Chicago.  There we have three sons and one is
 Howard, Gordon and Daniel.  Now they are all 
three me dical me n.  The y™re all doctors.  And one 
even married a doctor.  
And they are all three 
ma rried, and we are very proud, to Jewish wome n,
 and we have eight grandchildren.  I would 
like to me ntion their names fast of them.  On
e is Courtney, Lindsey, Ari, and Evan, Rachel, 
Benji, and Ye lly.  Do I have all eight?   I don't know, I don't want to mi ss any one.  Maybe I 

didn't do it in order, but it™s close. That's it.  So
 far, I'm retired and trying to spend as much time 
we have to talk about the Holocaust to tell our
 story to teach what we went through in the 
Holocaust and the ma in purpose it shouldn't happe
n again, to reme mber and it shouldn't happen 
again.  So, we are trying Œ  the only thing throu
gh education these people will be more moral, 
these kinds of things won't happen again.  Not 
only to Jews, we hope it doesn't happen to any 

people in this world.  Thank you. 

 

Q:  Thank you
