Tape 1 
Question: Goodmorning. 
Answer: Good morning to you. 

Q: It™s lovely to be 
here with you in Maine. 
A: Thank you. I™d like to thank you fo
r inviting me  to tell you a story. 
Q: Well, we™re very happy to have you to be he
re with you. So, first let me  ask you Œ what was 
your name  when you were born? 
A: My name  was Helene or Leney, they calle
d me , Mencel, M-e-n-c-e-l. You would pronounce 
it sometimes Men-chel . 
Q: M-e-n 

A: c-e-l,yes. 
Q: And you we re born where? 
A: I was born in Austria. 

Q: InVienna? 

A: It was in Vienna, outside. 

Q: And what year and what day? 

A: It was 1912, May 10
th
. 
Q: May10
th
? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: So, you™re a Ge mi ni? 

A: Beg your pardon?

A Are you a Gemi ni? 
A: I don™t know. I don™t go by that there. 

Q: I wanted to get some  sense of what life 
was like for you when you were growing up. So, first 
let™s talk about your family. 
A: All right, I will tell you about my fa mily first,
 but before I start, I want ed to say something 
why I am he re and why I was hesitating for a long time to tell my story. The reason wa s 

because it™s not the typical stor y 
of the Holocaust. I was not in a concentration camp. It is my 

life during the Nazis outside. It 
is actually a story of faith, 
all about faith, hope, courage, 
think about all mi racles. I want to
 bring it out in this 
story, that if you believe in it or not, 
mi racles still exist. Now, you want to hear a
bout my fa mily, correct?  I, we have been six. 
Originally, we had a brother died before I was 
born, and other sister. I 
am the youngest in my 
fa mily. I have a sister Be rthe. She™s the oldest
. Then I have sister Fanny (ph) she is Œ she 

come s after. I adored Fanny. She was Œ hadcharisma . She was outgoing. She was beautiful. 
Sometimes I wonder how I admi red her so that I di
dn™t resent it in that I wasn™t jealous. For 
instance, comi ng back, all my fa mi l y was very 
good in ma thematics. My father was almost a 
genius in that field. She was ex
cellent, but I wasn™t very good ma thematics. I was the best in 
physics. But I never reached Fanny, you understand, 
and the teacher would always say when 
I was a little kid, ﬁYou are good, but
 not like your sister Fanny.ﬂ 
I didn™t resent her. I loved 
her, and it is actually strange. Then, I had brot
her. He was known Œ he was an excellent chess 
player, and what he did Œ Fanny ha
d a doctorate in chemistry, th
e other sister just told you Œ 
he was in business with stamps. He was a 
stamp collect or, but it was really, it was his 
business, and then he was excellent chess play
er, they called him from all Europe (ph). And 
then ther e were myself. That it is about the st or
y. We  grew up in Vienna. Vienna is one of the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0414  
3 
 
most beautiful cities. I love Vienna. I™d go b
ack to Vienna, and people some ti me s resent it, 
comi ng from the Nazis. Vienna was occupied 
Œ why do you go back?  I did not know at first. 
I was thinking, ﬁ Why do I go back?ﬂ I found out I 
go Œ if I would not go 
back, if I would be 
afraid, it would be a victory of Hitler. This ci
ty didn™t belong to him. It was part of me . I 
grew up there with my fa ther and my mother my s i sters. I went to school. I was so happy 
there and I want to keep it. S
o, I go back whenever I have so
me  money left. I go back, enjoy 
the street, enjoy the schools. Th
at is about. Do you want me  t o
 talk about other things like 
schools? 
Q: Let me  first ask you about- 

A: Sure. 

Q: About what it was like in your home . 
What™s your earliest memory as a child? 

A: What is my earliest me mory
 as a child?  You will laugh, but 
I sort of reme mber when we 
celebrated a Jewish holiday. I mu
st have been very little, a
nd my father was sitting was 
sitting there and this was a Seder, and that he 
had a pillow sitting it. I 
had a feeling he is not 
really there, he was so involve
d, but not my mother. He was so 
involved and at time s, I asked 
my mother, ﬁIs father God himself? ﬂ I was so 
little, ma ybe three or four years old, but it 
ma de that kind of i mpression. My life was ve
ry lively. We  we re four children. As you can 

imagine, I was the youngest, real
ly the youngest. My oldest sister
 Berthe was like a mother to 
me , and I always thought, well, she tried to boss me  around, but it was not easy, and I 

thought very often, ﬁOne day I will be older than
 all of you, and then I w
ill be the boss!ﬂ And 
they adored me , but suddenly, nobody expected th
at there wa s a little girl here. And I was 
actually spoiled, but not spoiled, because if you 
hear my story and what developed and how I 
developed, you have to tell yourself, ma ybe 
it doesn™t hurt if you spoil some body. Vienna

was beautiful. Vienna was a city everybody would 
like to go. There was art. They describe it 
in the books; later it came out. Th
ere is no other city in Europe
 that you have at the same  
time, the mo st famous writer, the mo st famous
 ar tists, the most famous composers. There 
was like music in the air. Now, when  I go 
back, I hear it. I walk on the Chancellor 
Strasse
 Œ 
people are playing the violin, 
people are singing. It™s a 
different world. When people 
some ti me s visit Vienna now, and they come  back
 and they say some thing like, ﬁI  was a little 
bit disappointed, the way you describe it.ﬂ I can
not understand it. They did not feel what I 
feel. They do not see the city like I see it. 
Q: Were you close with your Œ did your fa
ther become  a less god-like figure to you? 
A: Oh, yes, yes. That was three or Œ I would 
say definitely. I tell you, fa
ther and mother were 
very different. My father, everything meant to
 him Œ study, learn, work. He says he can take 
very interest because he can do Œ they can ta
ke everythi ng away from
 you, but your learning, 
it will always stay with you. And I reme mber when
 I studied, all the scho
ols, they were very 
strict, especially when I had the me dical exams.
 I took the street car. He would be Œ he did 
not know when I would be comi ng home. He wo
uld wait hours to find 
out, ﬁDid you pass it? 
Did you pass it?ﬂ Yes, I was close, but it was ev
erything was learning. To
 a certain extent, I 
was closer to my mother even. She was more 
practical. She wanted me  to have nice clothes 
to have Œ to have Œ father just wanted to have
 it all, too, but all in 
that picture of learning. 
Both were very different, my father 
and my mother. It wasagood marriage.  
Q: It was a good ma rriage? 

A: Yes, it was a very good ma rriage.  

Q: So, did you talk with your father about different things than you talked with your mother? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0414  
5 
 
A: I™ll tell you one thing. I talked
 with him about studies and wo
rk, but he was interested, but 
not as much like my mot her. You see, it was different. 
Q: So, you talk with your mother
 about more pe
rsonal things? 
A: Yeah, I talked with my moth
er about myself, about my frie
nds, about Eddie, or whatever. 
That was the Œ my father was always Œ here a
bout to stress it (ph) Œ he was unusual. He was 
unusual, then I would say he was almost like 
a genius when it came to mathe matics. He 
didn™t have a for mal training, and 
he could serve, he could help
 us with any kind, the hardest 
problems there was. He would know how to so
lve it. He, himself some times, he couldn™t 
explain it to me how he did it. 
He hadn™t learned it, but he came
 to it. Fanny, that sister, was 
to a certain extent like that. 
Then, I do not know. I had a brothe
r, Benjamin Œ he died when 
he was 10. I was not born yet. And, they would 
tell stories Œ none of us children were like 
him. They would tell stories about him, how brillia
nt like as an infant he
 was. He would read 
some thing. He read the Torah. He knew the w
hole thing by heart. How kind and good, gentle 
people would talk to him. Years after he passe
d by, there was still, I was told, on his grave 
from some gentle people a note ﬁHere lies Benj am
inﬂ and a few words that would describe it. 
Q: That™sveryspecial. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: What did your father do for a living? 

A: He was in business. He was in business in me
n™s; it had to do with me n™s clothing. You see, 
people made their clot hes at the time, more than 
you went to the stores. He sold the material, 
the linings, the buttons, the whole thing. 
Q: And would you consider yourself fairly well-off? 

A: I would say mi ddle class. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0414  
6 
 
Q: Middleclass? 
A: Yes. But not for the American way, you unde
rstand, but the Viennese, Austria at the time, 
nobody had a lot and were rich like here.  
Q: Did your mo ther work, as well, or not? 

A: No, no, she had four children, and no, she did not work. 

Q: Did you have lots of friends growing up? 

A: Yes, I did. I was at first, I was a little shy 
Œ overwhelmed by this, but I had friends and I need 
friends, until today, you know?  You grow olde
r, you lose some ti me s some body, but  I would 
still say Mahkta (ph), she was 
my be st friend. Funny, I would not say my sister, she wa s my 
best friend. I had friends. I wa
s very popular, and I belong to 
youth groups that the called 
Maccabi, Blau We iss. It was very oriented, but
 you had wanted to belong to some thing, and 
like I was a wonderful gymnast, and I belonged 
to the Œ you know, we were divided in row Œ 
I belonged to the first row, and we would trav
el through the blau weiss, through the maccabi, 
and here I was always little a
nd short, and I was there. Here 
I have to tell you a true story. 
When you went to the maccabi and to exercise 
and to jump and to Œ the pe ople watching Œ 
young kids watching, see who is good, who is not 
good, in a large gallery. I had a girlfr iend 
and she was there, too. I was told years later wh
en I started to - I must have 10, 11 years old 
Œ and I started to go out with Eddie, and hopi
ng he will ma rry me  one day Œ my friend Danie 
(ph) said, ﬁWell, you achieved your goal.ﬂ I sa
id, ﬁ What do you mean? ﬂ  She said, ﬁDon™t you 
reme mber?  When we were little girls, you looke
d at him, and you said, ‚This is the boy I™m 
going to ma rry. This is a boy I want to ma rry.™
ﬂ And, so, I married him, but it wasn™t hard. 
He went to me dical school, and Eddie was so, 
he was known as one of the best looking guy 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0414

of that. Sometimes I was wondering, ma ybe it woul
d have been easier, if he wouldn™t have 
been so good-looking, because he wa s quite arrogant. Forgive me , Eddie, but lovabl e. 
Q: So, you me t Œ before you were ten 
years old, you were 
really children. 
A: We were children, but don™t you see, I didn™t 
meet him. I pointed out
 to her. I tell you why 
she reme mb ers. Eddie wa s the best friend of the boy she ma rried, and that™s the way she 
r e me mb e r e d  i t .  
Q: That™s very sweet. Wa s your home a  religious home ?  

A: I tell you, yes, it was. My father wouldn™t like 
it that I hesitated because he was not fanatic. 
He was very religious, a very believing person. 
He knew that we were not so strict. And he 
just let it go. You know how some
 parents are? You better do th
is, or you better Œ but, it was 
a religious family. 
Q: So, you celebrated holidays? 

A: Oh, yes, we celebrated al
l the Jewish holidays, yes. 
Q: Did you go to Synagogue on a regular basis? 

A: I tell you, at that time Œ my 
father at big holidays, we went there on the holidays. Don™t 
forget one thing, in Vienna Œ you have Œ it™s
 a subject, religion, you can flunk if you don™t do 
well. 
Q: In the schools? 

A: In the school. You see there 
is the Catholic religion and the 
Pr otestant, but Vienna, Austria, 
was about 95 percent Catholic. The schools we
re very different from here. My children 
would get upset when I said it. It™s a shame.
 I pay so much money, you go only half the time  
you go to school, because in Vienna, Austria, you
 go six days to school. You go to mo rnings 
and afternoon. It™s not five da
ys. Vacation all that you have is
 two months. You have here 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0414  
8 
 
four months, and all the holidays. That was 
actually helpful becau
se then you studied, you 
were much younger when you went to the university because we crammed it in a shor ter 
period.  
Q: Did you have both Jewi
sh and gentile friends? 
A: Yes, don™t forget, I sure did. Where we 
lived, there were not ma ny Jews around in the 
district. Yes, we did, and under Hi
tler, here I will me ntion a stor
y. There was one little girl of 
my age, but I reme mber the little girl. I™m sure her parents became  Nazis, and ma ybe s he, 

too, but she knew in the end I was alone. She 
came  to me  Œ Genny (ph) was her name. She 
gave me  10 dollars. It was for me , a lot of 
money, when you have nothing. I said, ﬁI don™t 
want it.ﬂ ﬁPlease, Leney, please take it.ﬂ And it
 meant the worl d to me. You see that  I™m still 

reme mbering that.  
Q: So, when you were growing up in both being id
entified as Jewish, but 
your being in a context 
that wasn™t being Jewish. Did you 
feel anti-Semitism or was there- 
A: Yes, you felt it. You felt it, but it got worse b
ecause of the politics, it 
got worse. Don™t forget, 
in the friends I had at that time, there became 
ma ny Nazis. They were not Nazis, we were 
children. I have very good friends, verygood friends. Certain people who helped us 

afterward, it™s unreal Œ you have to see that pi
cture. He was a janitor (ph) if I me ntion a 
name , I want it to be for Prischle (ph). She 
practically gave the lif
e for us, you know, and the 
son, he still came to visit us here in the Unite
d States. She was just a janitor; you ma de more 
as a janitor here than over there. Poor , they ar
e. She just swept the floor on her knees, but she 
was very bright. She helped us wherever she could. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0414

Q: Did you, as you were growing up and becomi ng an 
adult, feel that the Jewish community, in 
spite of anti-Semitism, was well-integrated with 
in Viennese culture and society and Austrian 
culture and society? 
A: Yes, they were. You know why?  Because we
ll, you couldn™t join the fanciest country club, 
but that wasn™t the point, because we were a
bout two million people in Vienna, and we were 
about 10 percent, 200,000, but I hate to say it, but
 they were about the brightest. They would 
say when the Jewish people left, 
the spices Œ it™s stil
l a beautiful, still a cultural city, but the 
spices had gone from that city. You see have
 the famous writers, and composers. Yes, we 
were.  
Q: So it was. 
A: The anti-Semitism was developed by that. A ce
rtain amount is over there. You hear wherever 
you go, but pronounced they loved you, they li
ked you, but you were to a certain extent 
separated, because it was you, not them so muc
h, belonged to the maccabi. I belonged to the 
blau weiss. 
Q: Explain the blau weiss. 

A: Blau weiss, it was a youth move me nt, and it 
was especially motivat ed politically. It was a 
Zionist moveme nt, and the people we re very mu
ch interested in Israel. There was nothing 
here fr om Israel at that time, but still, the desi
re, you wanted to go there. You wanted to build 

up. There should be a state. There should be a 
country, like almost subconsciously you felt 
you should have some thing. My sister, for inst
ance, Berthe, my parents were very unhappy. 
She was very young, 17 or 18 years old. She ga
ve everything up. She did not go to the 
university. She wasn™t to build a state in Israel
, a country for herself.
 If you know what it 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0414  
10 
 
means, she was a 
halutz
 (ph); she __________ the story. Ther
e was nothing. She developed 
ma laria, all of this. So, I did not 
grow up, I was not a person like here. 
Q: She was a Zionist? 
A: She wasn™t a Zionist actua lly very strongl
y, but in blau weiss, when you became 14 or 15 
years old, you already planned to go to Israel, 
what to do to be strong, not to study, there was 
no time. There were no, not that kind of schools. 
Like all my friends, my Jewish friends, not 
all, but ma ybe 60 or 70 percent, they left school
 and they went to Israel. They lived in a 
kibbutz. I didn™t. I wanted to study. I wanted
 to become  some body. I wanted to be a 
physician. 
Q: And Berthe, did she leave in her early 20s? 

A: She left probably. She was 
very young, 17 or 18 years old. 
Q: And, was your father Œ were your 
father and mother both Zionists? 
A: Yes, they were, yeah, but still they we re 
against her leaving, especially my father. My 
mother, too, she wanted her here. Once you go, you 
are gone at that time , for days and weeks 
and there was no money to travel, yet they were
, but mother was more practical, like I told 
you. She was the oldest daught
er, you want her home . 
Q: And, you didn™t see Berthe until Œ for a long time? 

A: Not for a long time. She came back because sh
e took sick, she had ma laria, then she went 
back again. She helped actually. She rescued 
the parents. When Hitler mo ved in, you see, 
Israel was not Œ the Jews did not have Israel yet as a country.  
Q: It was Palestine? 

A: Palestine, you see, but the 
English had to give permission if you want to immigrate, and since 
there was a deadline, that only th
e parents can go to Israel, and 
only in this certain period. If 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0414  
11 
 
you did not go within these two or three months, 
that was the end. You would not be able to 
go. 
Q: Let me  go back a little bit and ask you a que
stion about, by the time you 
are ten years old, it™s 
a few years after World War I. The situati
on in Austria must be some wha t  difficult. 
A: Yes, I™ll tell you, they were (ph), like I said, 
we didn™t have time  for that. Austria once was a 
big empire and suddenly it became ve ry small. 
Yes, we had very hard time s, but the hard 
times were for all or most of the people, 90 
percent of them, but you Œ it™s wrong to say you 
survived. Yes, we ma naged. That 
city in the life had to give 
you so much in a way, the kind 
of friendships you rarely see. The way you, when came a we ekend, you would hike, you 
would ski together. Even in th
e little money of wh
at- You did things together. You were 
_____ cultural, like I said before, it offered you 
so much, and you would Œ it was next come  a 
weekend or whenever you had time, you would Œ 
even when you were very little, you would 
stay in the theater hours to be able to, not to 
get a seat, to get Œ to 
stand and to see that 
fa mous actors. You see, it was part of life, th
e same  thing with a concert, it was a must, and 
you wanted to go to the concert, 
to the theater, to learn an in
strume nt. You see, that helps 
even if you did not have financia
lly all the goods, but to a certai
n extent, it also offered you a 
tremendous amount of ri chness. 
Q: Would you say this was fa irly typical?  Th
at most of the young people that you knew were 
participating in the cultural life in this way? 
A: I hate to say it, but more Jewish people, 
more Jewish people. Whether it ma ybe brings out 
my history, I mean, I did not say not ge
ntile, but that was very typical- 
Q: OfJewish? 

A: Yes,yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0414  
12 
 
Q: Were you Œ other than being Zi
onist, was there a lot of
 political sensitivity
 in the family, so 
that you talked politics,
 what was happening? 
A: Yes, we talked politics. We talked politics 
because there were the So
cial Democrats and the 
Christian Democrats. The Social Democrats 
were more liberal, you know. Muriel belonged 
to the Social Democrats, and there were, then
 there were the Co mmunists. They put quite 
often the Democrats and the Communist in 
one party, what wa s wrong. Their ideas and 
ideals was not the same. And there was time 
we were not allowed to see the Social 
De mocrats. And to enter fascists, and Mu
riel, when it come s out, belonged to... 
Q: To the Social Democrats? 
A: Yes, the anti-fascist moveme nt. She wo
rked in the undergrou
nd for ma ny years. 
Q: How™d it happen that you got interested to become  a doctor? 

A: It™s a nice story. Yeah, I™ll tell you what 
it is. You reme mber I told you Fa nny, who was 
extreme Œ I was the best in the class, but she was even better. It was Benjamin, when it 
come s to ______ everything. My father, who knew all this at the time , wanted to have a 
doctor in the fa mily, not because of the title
. He always said, ﬁYou know, it is the most 

wonderful thing you can do. Imagine you have a 
sick child. You ma ke it well. Imagine your 
mother will be sick. You can help. There ar
e no brothers who will go on.ﬂ And hoped Œ she 
was much older Œ that Fanny, you see, Berthe, 
the oldest, had left for Israel, that Fanny 
would take over. Yes, she went. She started an
d dissected the first cadaver in me dicine, in 
anatomy. She came home and she said, ﬁDad, 
thank you. You can have it.ﬂ I never will 
become  a physician. 
Q: I don™t want to interrupt you, but
 we have to change the tape. 
A: Good.

Tape 2 
Q: Helene, when the last tape  stopped, you were talking about how you became a doctor, and 
explaining that Fanny came  back. 
A: That™s right, Fanny, who was my 
favorite sister, I hate to say 
it, but Berthe was a different 
function; she was like a mother to me. That 
Fanny, that my fa ther wanted her to be a 
physician, she came back from anatomy. She was  supposed to dissect. She saw the cadaver, 
come s home , and says to my father, ﬁYou can ha
ve it, not me .ﬂ And that was the end. She 
really started afterwards. She got a doctorat
e in chemistry and pharmacy, but not me dicine. 

Then, by and by, when I heard it, that that wa
s a dream of my father
, I didn™t tell anybody 
yet, but by time  developed for me , I wanted to be
 that physician, and so I 
started to Œ I really 
was very mu ch, but it goes with me dicine Œ ve
ry much interested in physics. I was the best 
_____ than anybody else, and I had a dream ma ybe 
I will be an engineer. I could build 
bridges and this, but that was unheard in Vienna
. I would have never, never had chance. You 
can™t even dream, as a woma n, to choose that fi
eld. I said to my father when I was much 
older, ﬁI think I™m going to try about to 
be a physician.ﬂ We ll, it didn™t bother me  
whatsoever. I dissected. I worked as ha rd. I love d it, actually. And that 
is the story. I always 
tell one story about one thing 
only that bothered me  once. Yo
u know, in Europe, exams were 
very strict especially pre-
me dical subjects, anatomy andphysiology and all of them. The 
people would get, I hope it won™t ma ke you sic
k, cadavers who will pay 
for it, and you would 
dissect it. It would give you 
experience that what find this artery and it will gi ve you 
experience. And here I was so
 young, and I™ll never forget, I ha
d paid in and I couldn™t go 
down there to the anatomy in the daytime. Iwent down, and it was the 
evening. Until today, I 
haven™t forgotten! That™s why I™m bringing 
it up. They were all laying around dead, and

covered, and all that you could see we re just th
e feet. I know it™s probably foolish that I 
me ntion it, but it wasn™t foolish at that time fo
r me. So, I started me di
cine and got finished. 
Here, too, is a very Œ I will br ing that other 
st ory later because _____ I wasn™t a doctor yet. 
Q: Let me  ask you some thing. How come  it was oka
y and for a woma n to become  a doctor, but 
not an engineer? 
A: Not an engineer Œit was the world of me n. Y
ou c ould not get into th
e school. You could not 
enter. That ™s it. 
Q: But medicine was more open at that 
time? Because that wasn™t true here. 
A: Yeah, me dicine was open because I would say th
at it was a strange to them that women then 
___ in the States. I would say 40 percent were 
wo me n. They didn™t finish, ma ny didn™t. They 
got ma rried and that was the end. 
Q: But you think 40 percent of your class were women. 
A: Were wome n, yeah, 35-40 percent. 
Q: Really? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: And were there restrictions on how ma ny Jews c ould come  in, do you think? 

A: I tell you, yes and no. There are tw
o divisions, actually. It was 
not spelled out, but it was for 
anatomy. You go to one lecture hall, and there are students in the class Œ there are hundreds. 

This is not yet, like, and the other, the ge
ntiles Œ At that time, the anti-Semitism was 
tremendous. Not only this different social peer 
class. They hated us. They would invade our 
quarters. There was a law in Austria, a law, 
police wasn™t allowed to go in, but you have to 
settle it by yourself. You saw people jumping 
out that had nothing on, who tried to throw 

them out the window, and I had seen it.
 That was before Hitler already. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0414  
16 
 
Q: So, what year would that have been 1930 or ™31? 
A: No, that was later in the earliest before th
e Nazi moveme nt came, 
everything Hitler. Maybe 
™33-™34. It developed around that time
, but I couldn™t tell you exactly. 
Q: So, being in school was dangerous? 

A: Yes, that wasn™t every day, you understand. They
 were lecture halls were still in the same  
building.  
Q: But you were separated in terms of -  

A: Yeah, I could go over at one point 
to study, to see friends over there. 
Q: But, your lectures were all together? 

A: Well, no, no, no. We  had very famous professors
. The professors who taught us didn™t teach 
them. 
Q: Really? 

A: Yeah. 
Q: Was that true as far as you know in the ™
20s or only when the Nazi move me nt began in- 
A: That was before. 
Q: Allthetime? 

A: It was all the time, yeah. It was not so in 
the open. You went out of your way. It not only was 
____ you go to school, you accept Œ you don™t accept and you do accept anti-Semitism, but 

you get use Œ you can™t be afraid all the time
. And not only this, you had other move ments. 

You felt so strongly to be Jewish. Actually, de
spite all of this, but you were proud of being 
Jewish. You can walk in the street as a maccab
i. We would sing our songs. We  were in the 
day it was a large group of ___. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0414  
17 
 
Q: And, when you went to me dical school, was it no t only that the classes were segregated, but 
the friendships were segregated? 
A: To a certain extent, ma ybe I couldn™t tell 
you because I didn™t have any friends over there, 
but I almost more think the classes. Because in public school, the 
gymnasium
, if you want me  
to talk then after this about the schools, but in 
gymnasium
 you were mi xed Œ Jews and 
Christians.  
Q: Butnot- 
A: Not in the university. 

Q: So, did you keep your childhood friends? 

A: Yeah, but I tell you, yes and no. Here, I have to
 come  back to our schools. Our school system 
was very different than here. When you first 
grade schools, you™re a
bout nine or ten years 
old. Your parents ma ke the decision if you want to go to the 
gymnasium
. Others ones went to 
boergerschule 
(ph) Œ that is public school Œ and 
gymnasium
. 
Gymnasium
 Œ the difference is 
tremendous, like day and night. You reall
y, I would say sometimes, to go to the 
gymnasium
 
and graduate mi ght have been just as hard 
like becomi ng a doctor. You have to study. You 
have to work so hard. In order to get there,
 you have to pass when you™re nine years old an 
exam, a state exam. You™re just a 
little girl, it™s like an IQ, an
d they test your knowledge. If 
you pass, you can go to the 
gymnasium
. You see, it was decided already very young. My 
friends over here, most of them didn™ t, they went to 
boergerschule
 and that was it. They were 
bright, and I had pals afterward 
_________ very much who went to the 
gymnasium
.  
Q: So, you™re lives separated? 

A: Separated, yes, Genny with her ten dollars. I 
said, ﬁLet them ___ﬂ, that name , she we nt to 
boergerschule
. The life Œ friendships you 
ma ke maybe when you were little, a little older, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0414  
18 
 
they stay with you unless you became  anti-Semites. Maybe she was a Nazi, I do not know. 
Even more so, I respect it that  she still liked me. 
Q: How would you describe yourself 
as a young person?  Who we re you then? 
A: Well, who was I?  First of all shy, ____ 
shy, because I was overshadowed by, I was the 
youngest. I always wanted to be older than them
, and I would show them. I was bright. I was 
outgoing. I had a treme ndous desire to have frie
nds, and if I reme mber, from there as a child 
to now, a friend means Œ you don™t have much or
 ma ny, just one friend or two Œ that you can 
talk with a pe rson who will underst and you, you 
know?  And, that meant to me , the world it 
meant to me , and it was a trait that showed in me
 as a little girl, and I wanted to achieve. 
Maybe very ambitious, maybe because I had th
at one sister, Fanny. It
 was not only Œ I was 
pretty, but she was not so pretty, but she 
had muc h more. She had charisma. Every boy, 
everybody who knew her later on, everybody wanted to
 ma rry her. You see, that was Fanny.  
Q: What was the difference in age between you and Fanny? 
A: Sevenyears. 
Q: Sevenyears? 

A: Yes. 

Q: So- 

A: So, if you are thirty (ph), but she™s a tr
emendous – Later on, there was no difference. You 
see, because it™s only six or seven– But late
r on there was no difference because when you 
get older, what difference does it ma ke 
if you are a few years older or younger? 
Q: Was she with you a lot even when you were a kid?  Did she take you places? 

A: Oh, well, I™ll tell you that Berthe and Fa
nny, they took me places; I loved it. You see, 
Vienna, like I said, was full of music and ba
lls and dancing. I was too young, in a way. But I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0414  
19 
 
cried about Œ they took me Œ someti mes if I went
 out to different function, they would loan 
me  a dress from the m. They took me . And, I remember these were balls; these were world-
fa mous. You know the artists set it up. It t
ook the whole opera, the 
whole building. They 
were working for it the whole year, to decorate
 it and you would dance, and the music, and 
with ma sks on. They took me , don™t you see? 
Q: It seems to me  that you had a wonderful childhood. 

A: Yes, I had a wonderful childhood. There™s so
me thing else. When I came here, until today, 
people will say, whether they are older, or
 older already, ﬁWhat do you mi ss the most?ﬂ You 
know what I would tell them?  I me a n, my friends, I mi ss the coffee shops and they would 

say, ﬁWhat™s a ma tter with you?  Go buy yourself a 
cup of coffee.ﬂ It™s not the same . You see, 

over there, the different coffee shops Œ ever
ybody™s allowed to go in Œ the artists are 
interested to meet othe
r artist, young or old, and talk. The me
dical student loves to go to me et 
other me dical students. We worked so, so hard. 
I would be there in the coffee shop fi ve or six 
in the morning. But that ma n and that chil
d and the other one Œ everybody was there and 
studying. We had some thing in common Œ comp oser, 
all the different, then, but it™s not that 
there was a line. You could go in, but it was wo
nderful. You never were alone. There were 
always these people. Until today, I would say th
at I like a big city. I 
don™t have to talk to 
them, but if I walk in the street, there are so 
ma ny different lives that go on, that you can see. 
Q: Do you remember the name  of your 
favorite coffee shop that you went to? 
A: No. 

Q: Did you go to one particular Œ would the me
dical students show up at
 one particular one? 
A: Yeah,yeah,yeah. 

Q: So, you all knew?  This wa s a real hang-out? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0414  
20 
 
A: Hang-out you call it. 
That™s right, a hang-out. 
Q: So, tell me something Œ you were
 so close to your sister Fanny. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: And she ends up going to Palestine. 

A: It was hard. A year before Hitler came, and 
the reason was Œ I told you she had a doctorate in 
chemistry, and she was a pharmacist. The times were very hard. Her husband, she had just 

me t, lost his job because  he had to Œ the Ch
ristian socialites were very Œ it was a bank 
business. You couldn™t get in. There was nothing.
 Despite her education, so a year before 
Hitler came in, she went to Israel. 
Q: And, that must have been really hard for you. 

A: Oh, for me . So, ma ny years have passe
d, and I see still the train. She was gone.  
Q: And so, even though you were 
older, you see that point - 

A: Oh, yes, yes, I keep singing the same  song 
all the time. There™s a German song, ﬁThe Clouds 
in the Skiesﬂ, and a little bird is flyi
ng, is flying away, and you sing to the bird. 
Q: Can you sing it in German? 

A: [Coughs] Oh, I don™t have really a voice. [Sings
 several verses in Ge
rman.] What it really 
meant Œ and Fanny loved that song Œ it™s a bir
d, and the bird Œ some body said to the bird 
ﬁSing for me. I will take gold and silver, 
and I will put it around you, and you can have all 
the goodness in the world.ﬂ And the bird sings 
to him, ﬁKeep your silver, keep your gold, 
keep your food, keep everything. I am a little 
wild bird, and nobody can ___ﬂ and I some how 
I associate it with Fanny. 
Q: WithFanny? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0414  
21 
 
A: With Fanny, with the song. And you said what 
we re your friends. I was maybe also eight or 
nine years old. We  graduated from one cl
ass or _____ everybody Œ what do you call an 
album Œ ma ybe you do it here, too. You write 
the school, you right some thing, ﬁOh, you were 
elegant.ﬂ ﬁI like you.ﬂ ﬁYou™re so smart.ﬂ 
The teacher wrote something, and somehow it 
really stays to me , and it says in German [S
peaks phrases in German
] ﬁDon™t blame life and 
life ever sinking under the Nazis,
 that life is too hard that
 you cannot take it anymore, 
because if you have, if you live in th
e life of fairy tales, if you have
 the eyes of fairy tales, the 
world is still of beauty and mi racles.ﬂ 
Q: And that™s some thing you carried with you? 
A: I carry that with me , ye ah. I had a lot of, 
how should I say? You can see, I was alone _____. I 
had a little faith. I had faith, hope. I was desper
ate at times, but hopeful, yes. All these little 
things, you ask me  how I was. 
Q: And you mu st have been an optimis
tic person in some  way all the way? 
A: Yes, even as dark as it was, I was. 

Q: Things changed in Vienna in 1933. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Years before Hitler beco mes– 

A: Yes. 

Q: –when Adolphus become s Chancellor. 

A: Yes, that™s right. 

Q: How does that change for you?  How do you reme mber the changes? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0414  
22 
 
A: That to a certain extent, act
ually, in the university, I felt th
at you were afraid to say Œ you 
were afraid to say certain things, and 
it changed for me. I became a Zionist. Do you 
understand? Not like my sister, Berthe. 
Q: Butmoreso? 
A: Yeah,moreso. 

Q: More so than you were before. 

A: Before,yeah. 

Q: And, that™s in reaction– 

A: To that, that™s right. 

Q: Did you feel endangered? 

A: I tell you, yes and no. Yes and no, really. Wh
en you are very young and you still strongly 
believed in some thing. I believed I wa nted to r
each; I wanted to be a doctor. I had a warm 

fa mily, and I belonged to the blau we iss. They 
we re all Œ I wa s a part of them. So, you do not 
feel it. My mother always sai
d, ﬁHitler is over in Germany.ﬂ 
She kept talking about it and 
scaring us. It didn™t bother us so much. Some how, when you™re young, you don™t dwell on it 

so much, and you still didn™t 
think they won™t be here. 
Q: Now, are you going out with Eddie at this point? 

A: Where should I go out? 

Q: No, were you dating Eddie? 

A: Oh, I see. 

Q: Where you boyfriend and girlfriend? 

A: No, no, no. I started Œ he was already in me di
cal school; he™d just st
arted. And I started two 
years under him.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0414  
23 
 
Q: So, you were at Œ you came  into the school afterwards? 
A: It™s a true story. I st
arted off medicine, and the 
kids Œ my sister™s friend was a little one (ph) Œ 
they said, ﬁDo you have a boyfriend, some body i nte
rested in you? ﬂ She ju
st ma de fun out of 
me, and one day I came home and I said, ﬁI think 
he™s the best looking of
 the students. I think 
he likes me .ﬂ And like, ﬁWho is it, Le ney?  Who i s  it?ﬂ Let me tell you this, it wasn™t 

anatomy, I was dissecting the cadaver. Here come
s Eddie. I did not know who he was, but I 
knew he was stunning looking at that time. He 
opens up a book, and starts reading it. He  
couldn™t read it exactly. It was Christian ____. It 
doesn™t have words, only symbols. ___ they 
called it, but it was fa scinating at  that  time. 
He reads this ma ybe ten, fifteen mi nutes. He 
looks at me , looks again to me , and says, ﬁYou
™re not smart enough to hear this.ﬂ And walks 
away. So, my sister said, ﬁDid he tell you that 
he likes you?ﬂ I said, ﬁNo, 
I just described it to 
you.ﬂ She said, ﬁThat™s the reason you think? ﬂ I 
said, ﬁYes.ﬂ And that™s
 the way it started. 
Q: So, after this, how did you meet? 
A: When we started, he was a friend of Œ a fr
iend of his I was going out with. It was very 
superficial. I didn™t really care for too muc
h, but he was studying me dicine, and so he 
introduced me  to hi m.  
Q: And Eddie is this fantasy from your childhood, yes? 
A: Thatistrue, 
but I forgot it. 
Q: Youforgot? 

A: I didn™t reme mber this person. If you are only 
eight or nine and suddenly you™re seventeen. I 
forgot that I ever met him there.
 I didn™t. He said to the one gi
rl, I™m going to- that I said he 
was so good-looking. I wanted him.  I will to ma
rry him. Then years later passed, my friend 
said, ﬁYou got him.ﬂ 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0414  
24 
 
Q: So, you didn™t ma ke the connection at all? 
A: No, no, no.  

Q: How interesting. So, you were not
 in the same  classes together. 
A: No, no, but in me dicine, you see, they ar
e interwoven Some time s you didn™t pass Histology. 
You have free choices: I want to take exam th
is, or take this exam, 
so, you meet again in 
certain lectur es. 
Q: And, did you study together? 

A: No, I had friends with whom I studied. I like to
 study a lot together with
 people. No, I didn™t. 
Q: So, what else is happening between ™33 Œ your
 parents are Œ your mother is clearly very 
worried. 
A: But, yes, I™ll tell you what
 happened. The Nazis ma rched in. 

Q: But, that™s ™38. 

A: Yes,™38. 
Q: But between ™33 and ™38? 
A: No, not too much. No, no, 
not too much. Absolutely not. 
Q: Now, I understand that Œ 

A: Life went on, and you knew that politics we
re about changing and the fami ly Œ people 
comi ng to prison– 
Q: The constitution rema ined everyone is equa
l, but Adolphus was sa
ying that this was a 
Christian state. 
A: Yeah,that™sright. 

Q: And outlawed the left and right– 

A: That™sright. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0414  
25 
 
Q: –except for his party. And that didn™t worry you? 
A: No, because I didn™t belong to this. It worried 
me  when afterward when we talk about Muriel 
because actually you were in danger if you were 
a friend of hers at that time. They were 
outlawed. 
Q: Let™s talk a little bit 
about Muriel, because Muriel 
shows up early in your career– 
A: Very,yes. 

Q: –and then she become s a very dramatic part. 

A: Let me tell you about. Muriel, it was like I sa
id, I was very ambitious. It was during medical 
school. There was one professor at that time . 
He was fa mous. He taught pathology. He  taught 
outside of Vienna, in Krems. A
nd he started early. In order toget to him,  you had to get up at 
five o™clock in the morning to take the street
car an hour and then you were there. Because he 
was so alive, the things that he talked. I was 
afraid of pathology, but 
he made you not afraid. 
He showed you a lung Œ the way he 
described it that it has to be, 
or a heart, where the valves 
are going. He  could do it in such a beautiful wa
y, it stayed with you. You were not as scared 
of what you were seeing. The person is dead. Th
at™s why he was so popular. He taught you in 
a way that it was wonderful. So, well, I™m goi
ng there for the day, I got up early because it 

was time to take the streetcar. In the streetca
r Œ like I said, crowded ve
ry Œ in the st reetcar 
there™s a young woma n and she asked me  where 
Krems is. I said, ﬁOh, I™m going there. Are 
you a me dical student? ﬂ She said, ﬁYesﬂ She said, 
ﬁYes, I want to hear Dr. Heurthiem (ph).ﬂ 
I said, ﬁFollow me .ﬂ We  get to Doctor Heurthie
m. We  sit there, like I have no idea. I knew 
she was an American. I recognized the accent, a
nd after the lecture wa
s over for the whole 
morning, several hours. She said, 
ﬁIt was wonderful, but I will not be able to come . I have a 
little girl that is ___.ﬂ She di
dn™t give me  the name. ﬁAnd I ca
nnot leave so early. I cannot get 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0414  
26 
 
help so early. You will have to-ﬂ You didn™t have to go to Heurthei m. So, I didn™t see her 
anymore, just once. 
Q: Justonce? 

A: Just once, and Œ no, that is not correct. I saw her. I didn™t travel with
 her. I stayed at her 
place. She always come s, came a little later, 
because I was waiting there an hour, and she 
came to the lecture. We had no time actually to 
talk. I was not ____ older, I didn™t have time. 
She was Œ very simply, there was no time, because she started right up when she came, then 

she left. She had a little child so she left
. She mu st have passed. And now, a long time  
passed. I did not know who she was. I did not kn
ow her politically. I wasn™t sure was she 
Jewish or not Jewish. I kn
ew nothing. Very little.  
Q: Did you know her name ?  

A: Yes, her name , I knew s o me  I think, and I 
knew Muriel. Later I found out, all of a sudden, 
that she was one of the richest 
people in the United States. 
Her father was Ar mor Œ wh at™s 
the other me at packing company?  The other 
large one?  She grew up, she describes in the 
book, with 14 or 15 servants with which she gr
ew up with as a child. But she hated it. 
Q: Excuseme ?  

A: She hated to be so rich. She was a socialist.
 She felt it was not just. One child has everythi ng 
and the other one would be hungry. 
Q: Did you know her name  
was Muriel Gardner? 

A: I didn™t know anything li
ke that, just Muriel.  
Q: JustMuriel. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0414  
27 
 
A: Like I said, we had nothing, 
we didn™t go out. I did not know 
it was comi ng. I did not think I 
would ever meet her again. She was some body s o
 much older. She had a group, she was in 
the anti-fascist. You see?

Tape 3 
Q:  The 
Anschluss
 is in 1938, but Fanny has left the year before. 
A:  A year before, yes. 
Anschluss
 was March 21
st
, ™38. 
Q:  March 21
st
. 
A:  I™m going to look it up. I™m al most for sure
. Yes, Hitler ma rched 
into Austria March 21
st
. 
Q:  It™s about time . So, tell 
what it was like for you when the Nazis and Hitler ma rched in. 
A:  Well, like I told you before about Vienna, 
the city Vienna, that you did not worry, not too 
much. You Œ all that I had wanted to become  a 
doctor, to help people, to raise a family. In 
front of me , there was, I say, a 
rainbow, and I wanted to reach 
that rainbow. I was almost Œ I 
almost had that rainbow. Just a few more months and I would be a physician, I would be a 

doctor. It is a feeling the world is yours, but 
I learned through experience, the world never is 
yours. Anyway, it was March 21
st
, ™38, Hitler ma rched in. It 
was like the clouds, like the 
whole world was falling on top of you. Within 
hours, you heard screaming in the street, 
ma rching and ma rching, swastika and swastika, 
Hiel Hitler
, 
Hiel Hitler
, even when the 
windows were closed, even when they had 
stopped ma rchingor singi
ng Œ you still had the 
feeling you hear it. Suddenly, you 
were afraid to go out into th
e street. You were afraid to 
stay home. You were afraid to go into your house, and not only this. I was alone. So, alone Œ 

my parents reme mber, I had told you, they had left. They were forced to leave in a way from 

my sisters, because the English and not only Œ 
I think I me ntioned it Œ for only a short period, 
parents would be allowed to leave and go to Is
rael. There was a deadline. If they had mi ssed 
the deadline, that would be
 the end. You could not go.  
Q:  Was this before Hitler, before the 
Anschluss
? 
A:  No, the 
Anschluss
, Hitler was already here. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0414  
29 
 
Q:  So, this is after the 
Anschluss
 that your parents- 
A:  That my parents had Œ everybody wanted to ge
t out. If they did to America, Israel, be it 
wherever, the end of the wo
rld. Save your life, get out. 
Q:  So, it was so imme diately violent and vicious. 
A:  Vicious, yes. This is unreal. In Germany, it 
took years until it devel
oped. Even at that time 
still, you were allowed to take certain thi
ngs with you when you immi gr ated. Overnight it 
practically came  to Vienna. 
Q:  Was this very shocking to you?  Or did it seem-  

A:  No, no, it was more than shocking. That is
 why I described to you before. You are happy. 
You have an almost Œ yes, it was Œ for the Na
zis. And they came  there slower in Germany. 

You didn™t expect in such a way. You didn™t 
expect Œ I described you nice people. There 
were people who were your friends. In a night,
 you lost them; they 
were not your friends 
anymore. I did not know. I did not know. I thi
nk ma ybe some  would have still been your 
friends. They™d be afraid. Pe
ople are afraid of Hitler. 
Q:  So, do you think people were moving away 
from the Jews primarily, not for ideology, but 
because they were afraid- 
A:  No, no, they were Nazis. Don™t forget, because there™s Nazi moveme nt wa s going in Austria 
and Vienna for years. It wa
s suppressed. ___ didn™t allow 
it to come  out. Suddenly, the 
Anschluss,
 they all give in. There was no fighting. 
Suddenly, imagine you™re a little bird and 
suddenly the doors open, you can fly, and that
™s why. Nobody was a nobody, and practically 
you didn™t go to school anything because ______
___ or could say, ﬁDo this and this?ﬂ And, 
then it came suddenly. That was a tremendous Œ 
i t  was worse at the time in Austria than it 
was in Germany because they didn™t de velop. I 
knew some people I met in Switzerland, they 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0414

still got things out of there. 
I couldn™t get anything out. We  
were poor overnight, practically 
overnight. 
Q:  Did you lose your apartment? 
A:  No, the apartment we didn™t lose. 

Q:  You didn™t? 

A:  No, I didn™t, but there were
 periods I probably would have lo
se, but you had to give up. You 
had to give up everything you owned Œ your silv
er, your gold, your jewelry, even if it wasn™t 
much, you had to give it up. You had to go down 
there to give it up. Some thing else why you 
didn™t Œ you orders Œ your shops had to close. You couldn™t work. You did not know what to 

do. And, I had just a few months to finish my, 
to become  a doctor. Within days, I got the 
letter, ﬁStop studying. Don™t come. It™s the end.ﬂ
 Do you realize what it means?  No money, 
no job, no work, no work, afraid every day, afra
id in your bed, afraid in your house, you 
wanted to go out, you were afraid, you still we
nt out. When you went out, you were afraid to 
come  back. I was fortunate, I never looked Jewish, the reddish hair and bluish eyes, but they 

could recognized because the Nazis all had a 
band around here. You see?  And it said, ﬁHeil 
Hitlerﬂ or some thing.  
Q:  Did Jews have to wear a star? 

A:  Yes, it was a star, and I had it on my passport.
 I™ll show it to you. I 
have my passport. A big 
ﬁJﬂ, and they gave you the name  and the numbers. ﬁSaraﬂ were the wome n. The me n were 

ﬁIsraelﬂ. 
Q:  And this was very soon? 

A:  Very soon you understand, very quick, very
 quickly. All the Jews get out of here. 

Q:  That™s what they wanted? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0414  
31 
 
A:  Yes. 
Q:  And about how ma ny months 
do you think were you still with your parents?  How ma ny after 
the 
Anschluss
? 
A:  No, really, because I told you there was a dead
line. They had to leave. I was Œ maybe several 
months. 
Q:  Several months? 

A:  Yes, they left . My fa
ther didn™t want to leave. 
Q:  He didn™t? 

A:  He was the type Œ he loved everybod
y. He said, ﬁWhat do you mean?  They won™t do 
anything to me ?  All my life, 
I was honest and good. I helped them. They™re my friends. 
Nobody would dare to touch me .ﬂ And you were even
 more afraid of him, he would go in the 
street, nothing. He had such a face. God will help him.  
Q:  And, how did he, if he did, how did he evaluate
 all this looting and this
 beating in the street 
and ma king Jews- 
A:  Yes, he left relative Œ he 
saw it, but left  relativel y early.  
Q:  And was it your mother whom 
ma de  the final decision to go? 

A:  Both, it was the whole family. There was no 
choice. There wa s no choice. It would be the 
end. They didn™t have anybody in America, wher
e should they go?  They
 would drag him to 
the concentration camp. He was an
 older ma n. He was not too well. 
Q:  And where is your brother at this time? 

A:  I was suddenly alone because the mome nt H
itler came in, at that mo ment, he tried to get 
away. People were running away to ___ illegally
, no passport. They would hide in houses. 
You wouldn™t hear from him. Suddenly, you 
heard from hi m from Switzerland, and then 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0414  
32 
 
once he went there he had no papers. The Swiss 
were not too friendly; 
the French were not 
too friendly. They wanted us out again. So, 
he ran from one place to anot her and hide.  
Q:  Did you, I don™t know whether your brother 
thought about this, but
 there was illegal 
immi gration at a certain point to Pale
stine. Did you ever think about that? 
A:  No, when the parents Œ you couldn™t Œ my 
sister Œ it was almost impossible. No, it was 
illegal. At that time , you hadn™t heard of it. 
And the way he went to Swiss over mountains 
and hiding in the woods and this and that, no. 
Q:  And you had no idea what was happening to him?  
A:  No, I did not. You were so much concer
ned about yourself, I didn™
t no. I didn™t even see 
them comi ng. From ti me to time , when there wa
s a telephone, he would 
get in touch with me , 
and try to help wherever he could. 
Q:  So, within a few months, you™re alone. 

A:  I am at home, but you do not realize, practic
ally no money, what my par e nts gave me  but it 
was not muc h. No mone y, no work, the friends I 
thought I had are not friends anymor e. I was 
alone, alone, nobody, no profession. You see, no 
profession. I did not know that I had 
some body i n the United States, you understand? I 
was alone. And here I met Œ here comes a 
mi racle, one of them that Œ in the start, you 
reme mber, I said there was faith and there was 
courage, hope and mi racles. Suddenly I get a le
tter that will get Œ my hus band, too Œ a very 
small a mount of Jewish me dical students w
ho had stopped studying Œjust a for m letter. ﬁWe 

give you two months™ time , and you can finish 
up your doctorate.ﬂ Why?  Because the blue 
sky?  We  studied day and night. I passed it. 
And never, never since then was ever a Jew 
allowed to do that. I had cousins who were not 
included in this few in the States. Suddenly, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0414  
33 
 
the world opened up to a cer
tain extent. I was some body and hoped I™d go to the United 
States, ma ybe I™ll be able to work, ma
ybe without a piece of paper, nothi ng. 
Q:  Were all the Jewish students in the 
class Œ in your class Œ given this letter? 
A:  Just a certain amount who fell time-wise 
in that group. There were
 nottoo ma ny, maybe you 
have to Œ maybe 30 or 40 students or so. You ask yourself why. 
Q:  Excuse me ?  

A:  Maybe 30 or 40 students, ma ybe why? 

Q:  But you don™t know why? 

A:  I did not know. Maybe____. 

Q:  It™s interest ing as 
to why they would do this. 
A:  I have a cousin she™s brilliant. She™s still 
alive. She left me dicine. She couldn™t finish.  
Q:  She couldn™t Œ they wouldn™t let her? 

A:  She wasn™t in the group. 
Q:  I see. So, you are now taking two mo nths
 of to study like crazy to pass this exam. 
A:  To do this, and I passed it. 
Q:  You passed it. 

A:  I passed several exams. 

Q:  Now, by this time you are involv
ed with Eddie. Are you engaged? 
A:  No, I was Œ yes, we can 
put engaged, but not ma rried. 
Q:  So, when did you actually start go
ing out with him in a serious way? 
A:  Oh, I was never serious. 

Q:  As soon as you saw him as an adult ma n. 

A:  Not so soon, but yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0414  
34 
 
Q:  So, when you say Œ it™s interesting because 
if you were dating Eddie, you say you™re alone. 
So, tell me that means. 
A:  I™ll tell you what that means. I wasn™t ma rried. He lived far 
away. He didn™t have any money. 
I was here. I wasn™t sure that he would ma
rry me . I was alone. He couldn™t give money 
because he di dn™t ha ve anything. He didn™
t have any soap! He just Œ I™m alone. 
Q:  So, how did you get food? 
A:  I™ll tell you one thing. First 
of all, some  people were nice.
 They would invite me . I was 
hungry a lot. Between several months. I started 
Œ these people I didn™t know Œ giving lessons 
to students, secretly. For instance, I me n
tioned Else Heise Hoidushke, she knew I had 
nothing. So, she said she knew some thing who wa
nts to learn Œ she needed Latin. I didn™t 
know Latin. She said, ﬁYou will. Prepare yourse lf
 for the Latin. You™re smart.ﬂ I did every 
time I didn™t have so ma ny, but once a week, I studied the night before for that week to get 

that to Latin. I was good in ma the ma tics. You di
d it secretly. I give some  lessons, physics. 
Q:  And she was a Jewish wo ma n. 

A:  Yes, she was a Jewish wo ma n. 

Q:  She was an older woma n? 

A:  She was an older woma n, yeah. She had a Christian friend who helped her. 

Q:  So, there were- 

A:  Yeah, look, it was like, scratch it. But I 
was still ______. People would even Œ would invite 
me  to a me a l . I had a little money that my pa
rents gave me, but it was very little, comi ng to 

an end. You were afraid. I gave 
some  lessons. I survived some how. 
Q:  Did you feel sick, physically sick? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0414  
35 
 
A:  You feel physically sick. You feel exhauste
d. You were tired. You™re
 desperate. I was not 
depressed in any way. 
Q:  You were not depressed? 
A:  No, I was scared, terribly scared, but I don™
t think I was. I wouldn™
t have been able to 
function. 
Q:  So, tell me  what was in your head Œ wh
at were you afraid of at that mo ment? 
A:  I was afraid every day that 
they would drag me  to a concentration camp, they™d throw me  in 
there. I feared death. They will hit me . They 
will sc rub the fl oors, do this Œ afraid. He was 
afraid himself. You said, ﬁWas there Eddie there?ﬂ 
Q:  Eddie was afraid? 

A:  Yes. 

Q:  Everybody was afraid? 

A:  Everybody was afraid Œ we had only one desire
, get out, find a rescue, some how get out. For 
instance, we decided before get out we should 
get married. So, he was late to come to the 
wedding. It wasn™t in a synagogue
 anymore. We didn™t send out 
invitations. I had no fa mily 
anymore. I was alone. Forget flowers or a nice
 dress, we couldn™t send out Œ you were alone. 
You and the rabbi and Eddie. He was late. I wa
s afraid they got him. You see?  Finally, he 
appears, and I reme mber so vividly the rabbi 
said, ﬁTake the glass and put the gl ass,ﬂ and 
steps on it.ﬂ And, he said, ﬁI pronounce you ma n 
and wife.ﬂ And it was the most beautiful 
mome nt, I did not hear them shouting ﬁHeil Hitle
rﬂ. I did not hear the ma rching. It was mi ne 
and I was his, and that  was Œ and you will see la
ter on in the stories that are comi ng that we 
were terribly hitched, that we did not want to leave each other. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0414  
36 
 
Q:  And when you got ma rried, you then went b
ack to his mother™s apartment and had a little 
dinner? 
A:  Yes, she ma de a little dinner. 
She had nothing for us, that™s all.  
Q:  When, you would walk, would you choose a par
ticular time to go out on the street Œ or you 
didn™t know?  There was no way of knowing? . 
A:  No, you did not know. You did not, no. 
Q:  Did you wear the Jewish star? 

A:  What did you say? 

Q:  Did you wear the Jewish st
ar or did you try to pass? 
A:  I tried to pass, yeah, but
 I didn™t wear  the swastika. 

Q:  Did most people who were not
 Jewish wear some  insignia? 
A:  Yes, so they were safe, you see, yeah. 

Q:  Did you ever see people being beaten? 
A:  Oh, yes, yes. That™s right They™ll grab 
you if you™re washing floors Œ oh, yes. Screaming, and 
they™d put us all in buses be carried away. 
You never knew what was going to happen to all 
the different people. He lost his family. 
Q:  He lost his fa mily. 
A:  Yeah. 

Q:  How do you account for the fact
 that that didn™t depress you?   

A:  Let me tell you something, I am a phys
ician, and when I talk depression, you know, it™s 
different. You can be depressed with all these 
things. I was desperate, but depressed Œ If I 
would have been really depressed, I would 
have opened the window and jumped out. Do you 
get it?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0414  
37 
 
Q:  Yes. 
A:  But how do you account?  I told you how I accounted. It was faith Œ faith, hope Œ look at the 
notes and what did I tell you Œ faith, hope, a
nd tremendous c ourage. And then, how about 
circumstances?  You will hear stories of 
Muriel, the story of 
the consul, I told you, 
circumstances.  
Q:  Okay, then let me  ask you another wa y because now I understand why the word depression is 
not the right word. How did you not become  c
ynical?  You™re seeing things that are so 
inhuman to your experience.  
A:  There™s no time  to become  cynical. You™re al
ways only ﬁI wa nt to get out. I™m afraid. I™m 
afraid. I™m a fraid.ﬂ That™s all, you keep going. 
Q:  Did you know people who committed suicide? 

A:  Not ma ny, no. 

Q:  Not ma ny. But you heard about it?  b
ecause there were a lot of suicides. 
A:  I was Œ you didn™t hear much, but I™m sure–e
specially I didn™t go so far. Probably people 
who are almost in concentration camps, 
haven™t been there yet, I would say. 
Q:  Do you Œ silly, I was going to say, ﬁDo you th
ink if you thought you were 
going to be sent to 
a concentration camp, that you mi ght have 
committed suicide? ﬂ 
Or is your spirit- 
A:  No, you don™t think so far. I was just thinki
ng of surviving every day. Every day you think all 
the time  in your mi nd, ﬁWhere can I find the person who canﬂ a piece of paper, I needed an 

affi davit for the United St ates in order to 
get out. People, not only 
United, but to go any 
place.  
Q:  You and Eddie get ma rried in December of 1938. 

A:  Yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0414  
38 
 
Q:  Now, we™re going from March until December. 
That™s a lot of months. So, all this time, you 
are trying to get out, w
ith or without Eddie. 
A:  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Q:  But, once you™re ma rried
, you won™t leave without him.  
A:  Yeah, it is not the sa me . You will see this st
ory. You felt different, like, you can see it in ___, 
different. Yes, I have to bring in 
some  stories. Muriel, you understand? 
Q:  Yes, please. 

A:  Muriel, same as my cousin, and then you will understand. 

Q:  All right let™s talk Œ your cousin. 

A:  The ma in thing is to find some one to get 
out, and I didn™t know, I had a cousin. It was a 
second cousin. Some body me ntione
d him to me  t here was a second cousin. I never heard of 

me . He hasn™t heard of me . It was very hard when
 I tried to get in touc
h with him, very hard 
to get through to the United States. I found his 
address. I found his name . People said, ﬁDon™t 
be foolish. He won™t send you anything.ﬂ I wr
ote him a letter. I described to him the 

situation. I described Eddie, who my  fiancé, who 
is, a long letter, as a 
me dical student and so 
on. I was walking very close to 
the university where I wasn™t
 allowed to work, but I was 
walking. And I was walking from the  
Rathaus
, the city hall, a gorgeous building in this, all 
insults. Suddenly, some body put their arm around me
, which is strange. Christians are afraid 
to touch you, you understand?  It™s a Jew. I tu
rn around. Who was it?  Mu
riel. And she said, 
ﬁLeney, I™m glad I saw you.ﬂ I hadn™t seen he
r in ma ybe a year or longer. I do not know. 
And, like again, I had no id
ea who she was, that she was rich or people she ________ 
nothing. ﬁHow are you?ﬂ And I said to her, ﬁD
on™t you know the situation?  I™m desperate.ﬂ 
And started to cry. And she said, ﬁYes, I understa
nd it. I™m going to leav
e here. I™m going to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0414  
39 
 
France because I cannot stand it here either 
myself.ﬂ Even though she was not Jewish, and 
then she said to me , ﬁLe ney, I have sent out 
so ma ny affidavits.ﬂ You know what an affidavit 
is. ﬁTo so many people. I don™t think they woul
d accept anythi ng from me  anymore, but if I 
can help you anyway, tell me .ﬂ Here, again, 
I had no idea that she was one of the richest 
people in the country, and I 
think for a mo ment and I sa
id, ﬁYou know, Muriel, ma ybe you 
can help me .ﬂ She said, ﬁWhat is it Le ney? ﬂ I 
said, ﬁI wrote a letter
 to my cousin, Sam 
Menczel, in German. My English is no good. C
ould you translate it? ﬂ ﬁOh, sure. Come  up to 
my apartme nt.ﬂ Next day I come  up to Muriel. 
I realize suddenly that she must be very 
wealthy Œ not that arrogant or anything, just
 the neighborhood, where it 
was. Went up to her 
apartment, and me t here that lit
tle girl, that Connie, and she sits down and took the long Œ it 
was a very long letter writing to Sam Menczel. 
She was Œ after she was done, she leads to her 
door and she looks at me . She had tears in her eyes, and she says Œ mi nd you, she practically 

did not know me  only from that lect
ure to that time Œ tears in 
her eyes, and she says, ﬁLeney, 
if there™s anything I can help
 you, please get Œ I™m leaving for a few days. I give you my 

address. It™s American Express in Paris. Wh
erever I go, they will send the ma il to me .ﬂ And, 

she Œ I reme mber that. ﬁAnd I will travel back 
again. I can™t se nd affida
vit, nothing.ﬂ I sent 
the letter on Œ her letter that she transl ated 
on to my cousin in New York. Weeks passed, I 
didn™t hear. Suddenly, I got 
a letter. I have that le
tter after so ma ny years.
 I get a letter from 
him. ﬁDear Leneyﬂ, he said, ﬁI
 read your story. I was so t
ouched, what you ma de from your 
life. I™m going to Œ I want to help you. I™m goi
ng to send you an affidavit, and I will Œ I will 

be good to you. My wife, Rosie, and the childr
en will love  you, and forget your boyfriend or 
fiancé. I cannot. I™m not rich enough. I can™t 
send him some papers
, but looking at your 
pictur e and that you are a doctor or  become  
a doctor, you won™t have a hard time, you will 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0414  
40 
 
find some body else who will love  you.ﬂ I was so
 happy with the letter, ye s and no because 
Eddie Œ at the mo ment Œ I mean, from Heaven, su
ch a letter. I carry th
at letter wherever I go, 
but one thing was clear to me. I will not leave wi
thout him, without Eddi e. I™d rather di e. I 
don™t care at all. So, I got th
is letter and a few we eks agai
n pass, trying to ma ke some  
connection for him. I mpossible, I didn™t fi
nd anybody. Suddenly, I get 
a call, who was it?  
Muriel. Wh o was it?  Muriel. And again, I knew r
eally nothing except for th
at one lecture that 
I saved her a seat. Muriel, she said to me , ﬁL
eney, did you hear from your cousin? ﬂ  ﬁYes. But 
he™s not going to send anything to Eddie, a
nd I™m not leaving without him.ﬂ She thinks a 
mi nute, and she says, ﬁLeney, don™t despair.ﬂ I was 
a stranger to her. ﬁD
on™t despair Even if I 
sent so ma ny affidavits Œ wait, wait, help wi
ll come .ﬂ A few days 
passed, Muriel called 
again. ﬁLeney, Eddie has affidavit. I didn™t ha
ve to send anything. I called up. I talked with 
the ambassador, and an affidavit is there.ﬂ S
o, you can imagine. The world was ours. The 
world was ours. I mean, was it really true th
at just  a few weeks there was nothing? And I 
now had to wait for a certain numbe r. Even w
ith the affidavit, you cannot go to the United 
States. Your number has to come  up. It wa
s a quota. There was a quote Œ from the number 
way back. They were not ready for us yet. We  had to wait. 
Q:  We™re going to have to wait to because we™re
 going to have to change the tape. So, we will 
start with this story. 
End of Tape 3 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0414  
41 
 
Tape 4 
Q:  You know, we forgot to talk 
about some thing. So, let me  go back 
in time  just a little bit. You 
were in Vienna during the 
Kristallnacht
. 
A:  Yes, I was in Vienna. 
Q:  And we didn™t say it at all. 

A:  I didn™t stay in at home at all. I was by 
coincidence with friends,
 all the _____, and now I 
walk and we heard it. I did not realize that
 ____ grabbing and grabbi
ng whatever they can. 
All they synagogues were burning. It was a sight 
in the scared where you couldn™t– I did not 
know I was alone. Should I go back? I stayed with
 them overnight, then I went back, I do not 
know. Do I still have a pl ace to 
go or–?  But it wa s unbelievable. It became  the very fast the 
Kristallnacht
, like a flash, and then it wa
s gone. Well, it was never gone.  
Q:  So, did that ma ke you even mo
re frightened than you were befo
re or was this a continuation? 
A:  No, no, no. Even more. 
Q:  Even more?  
A:  You saw the concentration, in the form, you see, it was concentrated. 

Q:  All right, when we ended the last tape, 
you were talking about the 
fact that your numbers 
were comi ng up, but I want you to explain 
because ma ny people don™t know what an 
affi davit is. 
A:  An affidavit is this. You must have so me
body in the United St ates who is willing to send you 
papers for you to come  to the United States. Th
ey are believed to be write out, but you have 
to show proof of suppor t, that you have the means,
 that I will not be a burden to the St ates 
until I™m a citizen.  
Q:  No, no, it™s fine. Let me  ask you again. Explain what an affidavit is. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0414  
42 
 
A:  An affidavit is you have to find some one Œ it doe
s not have to be a rela
tive Œ who™s willing to 
send you papers to go to the Unite
d States, and the papers has to
 show what he owns, income  
tax and so on Œ that he™s really, if it come s to 
it, that he™s able to support me, and that I will 
never be a burden to the United States as long 
as I™m not a citizen anymore, because if I™m a 
citizen, it is expected that I s
upport myself if I™m able. So, Muriel
 sent me  that affidavit, but Œ 
not Muriel, Sa m Menczel; Muriel sent it for 
Eddie Œ but you had to wait for a quota number. 
There™s only Œ some body mi ght send some body 
a hundred affidavits and only a certain 
number are allowed to enter every year to th
e United States, and there it was important from 
which country you came from. For instance, if 
you came from Scandinavia, it was very easy 
to enter. They will give you numbers because Scandinavian people had no interest to go to 

the United St ates. So, we had to wait for our 
numbers. And so, it was ve
ry hard until you get 
to it. I got right off. I got the numbers, but th
e Germans had to give me all the permission to 
get that number that I™m clear. I have all th
e Œ did I tell you the story how I worked as a 
ma i d ?  
Q:  No. 

A:  I did not tell you. Okay. 

Q:  Is that before? 

A:  Before that, yeah. It was 
the largest library in Vienna. It was like a beautiful home and 
beautiful furniture. They did not want to gi
ve me  that number yet, so one ma n who ha d 

looked over the income  tax, ﬁI have a mother. 
She™s old. She™s sick. 
If you find me , if you 
arrive , you will work for me  as a ma id, when
 she™s all done, ma ybe I will let you go and your 
fa mily.ﬂ So, I took the job and it was a nightma re
. She was so mean to me . I worked day and 
night. She was very sick and didn™t give me  pr
actically anything to eat
, but God help me  she 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0414  
43 
 
died after three months. So, that
 was fine. He went into Eddie™
s apartment, took out the nicest 
furniture he wanted to, and said, ﬁNow you have
 the numbers, too.ﬂ And, he also Œ Eddie, not 
me .  
Q:  Who was this man?  Was it a German? 
A:  A Ger man ma n.  

Q:  A Nazi? 

A:  A Nazi, sure. They were a
ll Nazis. They were all Nazis. 
Q:  So, Eddie had a number, his family had no affidavit, however. 

A:  No, his fa mily Œ his mother perished, and 
Eddie had an affidavit for Muriel. I told you 
already the story how she calle
d and she said, am I right? 
Q:  So, how is it when you got 
the affidavit from my cousin? 

A:  My cousin Sa m Menczel. 

Q:  And that™s the only 
affidavit that you had? 
A:  Yeah, I didn™t need anymore 

Q:  Right, you just needed the one. 

A:  You just need one affidavit. 

Q:  And, was your number a lower number than Eddie™s number. 

A:  I™ll tell you Œ here, I want to 
tell you. I was about the same , two three or four or five, close, 
but his number came up and he was in Vienna sti ll. I was at that time  already in Switzerland. 

I™d got a temporary Œ you wanted to get out. You 
had to get out. I got a temporary visa from 
the Swiss, and Muriel helped me  do it. Do 
you understand? He didn™t have it, but then his 
number came up. He got a letter from the Ameri
can consul. He went right up and he got his 
visa. Do you understand?

Q:  Yes. 
A:  Here I was in Switzerland, my numb er cam
e up. The American Consul in Switzerland, which 
was the American, was very mean. He woul
d say, ﬁIf you want your number, go back to 
Vienna, go back to Austria Œ which was Germ
any Œ and get your numbe r there.ﬂ I could not 
go back. I had signed that I would never go back. 
That means if I go back they™ll send me  to 
a concentration camp. He didn™t even want to list
en. In the end, people did not even try to ask 
me , ﬁPlease help us. Give us it.ﬂ Because everything was here. But he 
just didn™t want to do 
it. 
Q:  Can I just ask you a question? 

A:  Because it ha d to be clear before the things are interwoven. 

Q:  Why did you go to Switzerland? 

A:  I™ll tell you why I went to Sw
itzerland. You did not know from 
one day to another that if you 
will be alive, do you understand? Wh oever would help you?  It was Œ why did my brother?  
He did not even have a temporary visa. It was 
like sent from Heaven. I was safe for several 
months. She must have Œ sh
e gave me money, M uriel. 
Q:  And did you see Muriel wh
en you were in Switzerland? 
A:  No, I didn™t. She - from t i me  to time, she w
ould send me  the tickets to go to the United States 
indirectly, but she wired ﬁThe tickets are co
mi ngﬂ, but it ma kes it also very hard. Do you 
know what the Joint was?  The Join
t helps people refugees that 
were there with money to get 
settled. I di d not know it in the begi nning. The Jo
int didn™t help me  because Muriel said, ﬁI 
didn™t want it. I will help them as mu ch as I 
could.ﬂ And she did. I gave her everything, every 
penny back in the years to come , but Muriel 
was always in the background, and when it was 
needed that people would support you, she would help me . 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0414  
45 
 
Q:  And did she not want you to be in touch with the Joint? 
A:  No, she didn™t want Œ she wa
nted to help to support us. 

Q:  So, when you- 

A:  She helped us to go to Switzerland, me . E
ddie c ould not go out here
. It did not have the 
papers fr om the Germans until I was married him, reme mber what I told you? 
Q:  So, you go the papers first? 

A:  Yeah, that™s right. 
I got the papers first. 
Q:  And you we re willing at that point to se
parate from Eddie because you thought he was 
comi ng. 
A:  Oh, yes, and it was not only I, everyb
ody. Because every day you would said, ﬁHow did you 
feel to go out in the street? ﬂ  
Everyday you were scared. I wanted
 to get out. I was alone. I 
had nothing. 
Q:  Did you assume  that Eddi
e would come  to Switzerland? 
A:  I hoped so.  

Q:  So, when you got to Switzerland, you we
re even more alone because you don™t know 
Switzerland. 
A:  That™s right. 

Q:  Where did you go, Zurich or no? 

A:  What did you say? 

Q:  Where were you in Switzerland? 

A:  I tell you, I was in different places. I was b
ecause wherever they would let you in. I was in 
Davos, Switzerland. I stayed two days in Zurich. 
I started to hide. Then I was in Geneva, I™ll 
tell you why. The visa came  to an end soon, my
 Swiss visa. I promised I would be out of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0414  
46 
 
Switzerland. Here I was caught. 
I couldn™t go back to Vienna. 
The Swiss didn™t let me there 
because they prolonged it once, and that was 
the end. I didn™t know what to do. I tried Œ I 
started to hide. My brother was either in Reins or  some place called me  and said, ﬁYou have 
to get out. They won™t let you.ﬂ But I did not 
know what, so he said, ﬁLook, I will tell you all 
this on the phone, let me  tell you what to do.ﬂ He
 said, ﬁTake your belongings.ﬂ I didn™t have 
much, ﬁGo to Geneva. There is a League of Na
tions in Geneva. There is a very prominent 
lawyer. You go down there. He mi ght not want 
to do a thing for you, but he has it in his 
power. If he wants to, he will help you.ﬂ I t
ook like my last money. I went to Geneva. Don™t 
ask me , I don™t know why I™m there. I do not kno
w. I come  to Geneva. I find the telephone 
number where the prominent lawyer is, had a hard
 time to get in. He didn™t want to talk to 

me . How I did it, I do not know. I reached him. I 
talked to him. He was very touched. I don™t 
know Œ people were some how taken by me . It™s ju
st Œ So, he said, ﬁI 
will help you.ﬂ Yeah, 

my brother said to me , ﬁLook if nobody helps you 
there, the League of Nations, you have to 
go illegally. You have to go over the border. It co
uld take you days until you get there. There 
mountains, mountain passes. Ther
e are woods. You will have to
 hike. If the Swiss find you, 
there™s no end to it. They will send you right back.ﬂ 
The idea that I should be as thin as I was 
and there was nothing but me , all by myself, scared
 stiff. Well, I talked to that lawyer. He 
called up a very prominent, very high official
 at the League of Na
tions. I understood French 
some . I did not understand quite enough to unde
rstand while he was talking, and he said, 

ﬁYou have to help her. You have to see her. 
Do what you want, but you have to talk to her.ﬂ 
She didn™t wa nt to talk to me . He was  pleadi ng with her. She agreed. I think they were 

probably very close with each other. I go over 
to the League of Nations. I have no idea 
anymore did I walk, I had no money for that. I got 
there. I meet her, fantastic building, very 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0414  
47 
 
elegant woma n. She was awfully nice to me . Sh
e took a look at me , and she said to me , 
ﬁDon™t talk at all. Did you eat  yet? ﬂ I said, ﬁNo.ﬂ She rings 
a little bell. They bring in a 
fabulous breakfast with orange juice and all th
is. I thought it was not here, it was heaven. She 
said, ﬁYes, I will help you. I will gi ve you a te
mp orary visa you will get to go to France.ﬂ 
And she said she will give me  to a _____ so I was relatively safe for a short period. In the 
meanti me , the war broke out. Poland and Germany, the borders were closed, and I did not 

need to go out right now, but Eddie called me . He
 said, ﬁLeney, I receiv
ed my Œ I have my 
visa. I have  the number.ﬂ I told you that be
fore. ﬁI have everyt hing. What will you do now?  
Your number is up. If you don™t come  to Vie
nna in two, three days
, your number will be 
given to some body else.ﬂ So, you 
realize the tremendous pr oblem, not going back to Vienna 
meant I would never be with Eddie again, becau
se  he™s going to the United States and I 
wouldn™t. I didn™t have it. Go
ing to Vienna was a tremendous danger, almost 100 percent. 
They would send me  right off into concentr
ation camp. ﬁYou have signed it. You have 
signed it.ﬂ I talk my friends, she wouldn™t want 
to hide me  in order to force me  not to go 
back. I said, ﬁI have nothing to lose . I will tr
y to go back.ﬂ And here come s the stor y about 
going back. As fa r as I knew, I will not be able
 to make it because the Germans will send me 
right off into the concentration camp. Now, I n
eeded in order to go back, I needed a visa, a 
German visa, to enter Vienna from Switzerland. 
Well, I think, ﬁLet me  try.ﬂ I get my stuff 
together, go to Zurich, and I go to the consul
ate Œ a tremendous, big building, a lot of people 

are waiting there in front to get in, maybe a hund
red or more, but this Œ none of them were 
Jewish. These were all gentile people who ha
d business, who wanted to go back, everybody 
needed a visa. They were standing. It was not op
en yet. They were standing in line for quite a 
while. Suddenly a Gestapo ma n, an SS ma n, come s out
, but he says first, ﬁHeil Hitler, heil 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0414  
48 
 
Hitler.ﬂ Everybody in the group, ﬁHeil Hitler, heil Hitlerﬂ and he says, ﬁI have to give  you a 
me ssage.ﬂ He says, ﬁYou all can go home . Yesterda
y they tried to assass
inate Hitler.ﬂ And he 
called him the Furor. If you said the Furor, this
 is the highest word in
stead of Hitler. ﬁThe 
Furor has given orders nobody™s allowed to en
ter the border anymore. To go out, not ‚til you 
hear from me at a later date
, I do not know when. The people a
ll went home . Within seconds 
that tremendous place was empty. The only pers
on who was standing there was myse lf, and 
two of the Nazis, the higher officials, Gest
apos. ﬁWhat do you want?ﬂ You get like so rigid. 
You do not know what to do, what is happening. 
You act, or you don™t act. So, what should I 
do?  No gentile, no Christian, nobody can get in. I™
m frightened to death, but I had only one 
desire. I want to be with Eddie.
 If I can™t be with Eddie, I mi
ght as well die. And I thought 
and I thought. I had to get in. I started 
ma rch to the door. Nobody™s ma rching with me  
anymore. Everybody left. And I see the big 
door and SS me n, Gestapo, all these wome n 
screaming ﬁHeil Hitler, heil Hitler.
ﬂ Standing straight. I went up to
 the door that I did almost 
consciously, I shouldn™t be scared. I should walk
 straight like I would 
look like I know where 
I was going to. I had no idea where the consul
 was. I had no idea how he looked, nothing. 
And, I was sure that they™d send me  back 
at the door, nobody can get in. I mean, I™ m on 
German territory. I walk straight to the door, gr
ab the door, and open it. I did it so fast that it 
didn™t occur. It probably looked 
like I am one from them. I was just ﬁIn I am. In I a m.ﬂ 
Tremendous  building, no idea should I go right?
 Should I go left?  Shoul
d I go straight?  Let™s 
see, which one could it be?  I do not know. I 
go straight and I start 
walking Œ walk, walk, 
walk Œ suddenly I come  to a big door, and I thoug
ht to myself, ﬁIt looks very impressive to 
enter. If I get inside, ﬁGestapo,ﬂ I said in 
my mi nd, ﬁmight be in.ﬂ I don™t ask anybody. I 
didn™t talk to anybody. I go to the door and open 
it, and I™m inside. In front of me  a big

49 
 
beautiful desk and a ma n sitti
ng there, I am God Al mi ghty. I assume  right off this is the 
consul. Next to him, Ges t apo, and guns, a
nd you name  it. And he looked at me , didn™t 
address me , either. Who was I?  You needed 
permission. You need an invitation. You just 
didn™t walk in that way. And he said to me
, ﬁ Wel l, what would you like?  Who are you? ﬂ And 
I start talking quickly, I said, ﬁI 
have to have Œ I have to go b
ack. I have to get an American 
visa in order to goﬂ, and I stop talking. He star
ts screaming, ﬁYou™re Jewish! You™re Jewish!ﬂ 
ﬁYes, I am J e wish.ﬂ ﬁYou dare. You dare to co
me here. How did you get in? ﬂ  I started to say 
some thing. ﬁGet out of here right away.ﬂ AndI tell him what  I want. He said, ﬁNo Christian, 

no Jew, nobody is allowed to get in.ﬂ And he 
said, ﬁGo!ﬂ And I looked at him, and he ™s 
furious at all the people who work there. I sa
id, ﬁI™m not going.ﬂ He said, ﬁYou™re not?  We  

are in Germany,ﬂ he said, ﬁY
ou will go to the concentrati
on camp. You will Œ looking at you, 
how you look, you won™t survive it. You won™t su
rvive it.ﬂ He said to me, ﬁGo!ﬂ Then, 
some thing in his voice got soft, and he said 
to me, ﬁGo, go, please go. Nothing will happen to 
you here. I will see that you get out, get you ag
ain on Swiss territory, but please go.ﬂ He 
looked at me . ﬁI™m not going.ﬂ He 
repeated this two or three time
s. Then, so far, he says, ﬁI 
wouldn™t want anythi ng should happen to you. Go!ﬂ
 And I said, ﬁI won™
t go because if I go, I 
will never see my fiancé, and th
at™s the end.ﬂ And he said, ﬁI cannot give  it to you.ﬂ And, he 
started again, ﬁGo,ﬂ and then he shows to th
e me n, he said, ﬁTake her and lead her out.ﬂ I 
said, ﬁI™m not going to walk.ﬂ He looked at me  
with a pierced look. His 
eyes were lethal, but 
he said, ﬁLift her up.ﬂ There was not much to 
lift. ﬁLift her up andcarrying her out, and out 

the door.ﬂ Two me n, one on the right, the other on
 the left hand Œ they carried me  to the door. 
He carried me  to the door, and a little out al
ready. Suddenly, you hear a voice, ﬁStop! Put her 
down. Come  here!ﬂ he calls me . I go in. He 
tells all the Gest apo, 
ﬁEverybody go out!ﬂ He 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0414

was only with me  alone. And he said, ﬁYou know
, I really would like 
you to go.ﬂ Nicely, in 
nice way. ﬁI would not want anyt
hing should happen.ﬂ And I sai
d, ﬁI can™t go.ﬂ And he said, 
ﬁYou seem l i ke _____ nothing anymore.ﬂ And he said, ﬁTalk to me .ﬂ I talked. He said Œ he 
takes a pen, and he says, ﬁGive me  your pass
port.ﬂ And he said, ﬁI  do not know why I™m 
doing this.ﬂ He said, ﬁDo you realize I can lose 
my position?  And, I can lose more than that.ﬂ  
He means that if he did it, some thing could ha
ppen to him. ﬁThis is against the wish of the 
Furor, of Hitler.ﬂ He takes the passpor t Œ I had 
the passport ther e Œ he takes it, writes in his 
name , and here™s a number. I have  a visa. I walk
 out. I coul dn™t believe
 it because I™m sure 
never, ever before, and it 
probably never will happen. W
hy did you do it?  Why did he–?  
And I said mi racles. Why did he it to me ?  
Why did he endanger his whole life and his 
fa mily?  Wh y?  And if this happened going to Ge
rmany, my life was practically safe. It was Œ 
here it was the consul hims elf that he gave it
 to me . Now, I had to go back, you see, I was in 
Switzerland now with a visa. I didn™t dare to 
tell to anybody. When the war with Poland was 
over, I get a ticket and I get on 
the train. I get on the 
train going back to Vienna, and the war 
was over with Poland. It didn™t 
take long, you know. It took over Œ the war was over, and I 
traveled only with soldiers, German soldiers
. They were ______ that I was Jewish. I had on 
me  my passport, but I didn™t open it, nobody sa
id Œ but you can imagine for hours, I was 
scared silly, but they were nice to me . They 
did not know who I was. 
I come to the border 
Switzerland and Germany Œ Austria, and there 
you had to go through an examination above it 
because I was not German. She saw the passpor t. They exami ned me . I had to undress. It was 

a woma n. And I had Œ I still have it, I ha
ve to show you. Wh en you got ma rried you had 
nothing yet. My husband gave me  a little golden 
chain with a little 
hear t. It was worth 

nothing, but I had it hidden anyway in a little poc
ket on the side. I™m afraid it falls to pieces, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0414  
51 
 
and she looks at me . She says, ﬁWhy didn™t you le
ave it in Switzerland? ﬂ
 I said, ﬁI couldn™t 
leave it. My husband said it would bring me  lu
ck.ﬂ And she looked at it, and she started 
discussing it with two or three 
other men, and then I was alre
ady dressed. A ma n comes to 
me and says, ﬁLook, you will hope be able to take
 the little heart and neck- (ph) out when 
you come  he re. I™m going to write it in your pa
ssport.ﬂ You see my pa
ssport with a little 
heart and necklace taken in. He wr
ote it in, and there it was. S
o, I keep on going. I arrived in 
Vienna in the evening. Eddie picks me up. We  we
re not allowe d to take a taxi or anything, 
and he said to me your number mi ght have b
een gone by now. It took me just two days, three 
days. They mi ght have given me  to some body else. And, did I talk too fast?  No. And, he said 

Œ the next day we rushed to the American Cons
ulate. Yes, my number was still there. They 
hadn™t given it away yet. They gave me  they nu
mber. They gave me  my  visa. I was the last 
one after the people had to wait for a long. 
I was the last one. You do not know such 
circumstances at the mo ment what they™ll be. E
ddie rushes me  to the train again, off go back 
to Switzerland. He still stays. He didn™t have hi
s numbers yet that he c
ould also cross. Rush 
me  all off to Switzerland, and I Œ no, I take a 
train to Switzerland, and we come  Œ it™s, of 
course, a German train Œ we come  to the borde
r. The train stops. The conductor says, ﬁThis 
train is not going any further, and there is 
no other train today or tomorrow that goes to 
Switzerland.ﬂ You can imagine.
 Wh at now?  What now?  I™m in German grounds. My time 
has elapsed. I have to be out. The one Germ
an asked me , she recognized me , ﬁYou have a 
necklace, yah? ﬂ I didn™t know what they we
re talking, ﬁDon™t you reme mber us?  Don™t you 
reme mber? ﬂ I was so excited, I didn™t, ﬁAnd no
w I have no train to go to Switzerland.ﬂ The 
one come s to me  and says, ﬁDon™t ge t desper
ate. I will show you how
 you will go.ﬂ He said, 
ﬁDo you see this street? ﬂ I saw the street, yes. 
It wa s also evening because it was dark. He 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0414  
52 
 
said, ﬁThere is no train, but you 
have good feet and legs.ﬂ He  sa
id, ﬁIt™s two miles from here 
if you walk. Walk, run,ﬂ he
 said, ﬁSo nobody can stop you. Run. After these two miles you 
will see on the left hand side 
a little house. Whe n you reach th
at little house, you are on the 
Swiss border.ﬂ 
Q:  We have to stop the tape right here. 
A:  Okay. 
End of Tape 4 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0414  
53 
 
Tape 5 
Q:  You were describing that the border guardwas telling where you could run, and he was 
suggesting that you should run. 
A:  Yes, where to run. It was dark. I finally f
ound the house he described. I 
cross over, here I am. 
I look at the skies. It™s dar
k. I look at the ground. I fall on my 
knees. I kiss the ground. I start 
to cry. Here I am. I have been saved. A new lif
e is starting for me . Two da ys later, I wa s 
headed for the United States. 
Q:  And Eddie come s a few days later? 
A:  I me t hi m, a few weeks, but I me t him on the border. To get in Genoa. 

Q:  In Genoa? 

A:  Yeah, in Genoa, again. 

Q:  So, he didn™t go to Switzerland; he we nt directly to–? 

A:  Correct. In the meanti me, he got his Œ it wasn
™t the next day. It was probably a few weeks or 
so to get the papers and all together. 
We went together to
 the United Stat es. 
Q:  Let me  ask you a couple of s mall details. 

A:  Sure, yeah. 

Q:  How come  you were allowed to go back into
 Switzerland?  You didn™t 
have a visa anymore. 
Was the American visa enough? 
A:  That™s a good question. I do not know because
, you reme mb er, I arrived on the brot he r and I 
had permission Œ I actually didn™t immi grate,
 leave Switzerland, completely. I had only 
permission to go for 48 hours to Vienna. That™s 
an excursion, and so I was back. Not only 
this. In the meanti me , the war broke out. Th
e Swiss could not throw anybody out anymore. 
Q:  They couldn™t? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0414  
54 
 
A:  No, not now. The Swiss borders, all of them
, were closed. It was 
the war between Germany 
and Poland. Even the Swiss were _____, but th
ey themselves did not allow anybody in or 
out. 
Q:  So, even for these few days when you 
came back, do you recall where you stayed, who you 
went to?  
A:  What did you say? 
Q:  When you came back? 

A:  Yes. 

Q:  Once you had the numbe r and you ran across the border– 

A:  Yes, yes. 

Q:  So, you kissed the ground. Now, whe r e did you go? 

A:  I™ll tell you one thing: at the time , I didn™t know
 it exactly. I stayed a time with a friend or 
some body else. I was hiding; I was used to 
that kind of life. I knew some  people. 
Q:  So, were you hiding, in a 
way?  Or did you feel safe? 
A:  I didn™t even give it a thought. With an affi
davit in my hand, ﬁHere I come ! A new life, here I 
come !ﬂ ______________. I had already my pass port, my visa, everything, I was waiting for 

my boat to go. 
Q:  Now, one other question. 

A:  Sure. 

Q:  It™s not clear to me  how your brother fi
nds you on the telephone, how Muriel finds you, and 
Edward. 
A:  Muriel found me  because I was in contact with
 the American Express, and from time t o time, 
the bank would call me . She knew how to get to me . 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0414  
55 
 
Q:  How did your brother know to get to you? 
A:  I think when I came to Switzerland that I call
ed him and told him. Then, when I tried several 
times to catch him some where where he was Œ maybe yes, maybe no. Sometimes I was 

lucky; I would get hi m. I  would try di fferent
 ways until I found him. Any your friends with 
whom I mi ght have stayed. 
Q:  So, when your brother left Vienna, he woul
d call you at home in Vienna, when you were still 
there– 
A:  When I was still there. 

Q:  So, you had some  idea, vague ideas, about where he was. 

A:  No, no, it maybe Œ he didn™t talk. He was afrai
d. No, that was from week to week, but that™s 
it. 
Q:  So- 

A:  I did not know when I would ever hear fr
om him. He hi ms elf was in tremendous da nger. 
Q:  And so his finding you in Switzerland wa
s a ma tter of his trying people you knew in 
common?  
A:  Yes, that™s right. Maybe he
 tried Muriel or some thing, I don™t recall the details. I do not 
know. 
Q:  And how come  you were goi
ng to take a boat from Genoa? 
A:  I bought, I got a ticket. I paid for it. 
Muriel helped me , for me and for Eddie. 
Q:  For both? 

A:  For both, sure. Like I said, we have given b
ack Œ Don™t you see, we liv
ed for a long time  in 
the mi ddle-west. I would have liked to New 
York and Albany. The Joint would help the 
people, but they didn™t want to help me . I did 
not know. The social worker told me  why they 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0414  
56 
 
didn™t want. Muriel said, ﬁI™m 
going to pay her anything she needs. I will pay for her.ﬂ When 
we found out, I said, ﬁI don™t wa
nt to keep taking money from he
r. I will take a job wherever 
I can.ﬂ So, we landed in the mi ddl
e-west. It was easier that  time. 
Q:  But, you were Œ was Eddie a 
practicing physician 
at this time? 
A:  I tell you, look, he just came  from 
__________. You need an internship, you need a 
residency, but to find it Œ you 
don™t find it right off either. 
Q:  But going to the Midwest 
is going to some thing foreign 
in comparison with Vienna. 
A:  It was so foreign. Lincol
n, Nebraska, Peoria, Illinois, you 
just don™t realize I could have 
stayed in Vienna. They didn™t a
llow us for a fe w years to take
 state board, and they didn™t 
grasp the whole story, but I did not 
want to keep on 
taking from Muriel. 
Q:  She was willing to keep- 
A:  I think didn™t even tell me  that it would come  this way, but it was sent through the bank or 
whatever. I didn™t see her. 
Q:  I see. 

A:  Maybe the tickets came . She helped me . 

Q:  And she was living in the United States now? 

A:  Well, she was traveling all over. Like I said, 
she grew up in a home  with fourteen servants in

Q:  [New ite m s hown.] Wha t  are we looking at, Helene? 
A:  This is my passport. This is a visa th
at I was allowed to enter again Vienna. Nobody was 
allowed, not even gentile people. The consul ga
ve me  this, the story who gives me  the visa, 
and the number, and he says, ﬁI don™t know why 
I™m doing it.ﬂ That is his name. That is his 
stamp. And I went back in it was November 26
th
 he gave it to me . No, November 8
th
 it does 
tell you it. 
Q:  Nove mber 7
th
. 
A:  Nove mber 7
th
, Novembe r  27
th
, I got my American visa. Here 
he endangered his life only to 
give me  that visa. I was the only one who c
ould enter again Vi enna. It tells you how long 
time I have. I have to be out on the 29
th
 of November. I entered 26
th
, out on 29
th
. [New item 
shown.] Thi s  is actually Œ the 
Nazis wrote down on the border Œ if
 they really were Nazis or 
not, I could not tell you, but they 
belonged that group Œ that I™m bringing in a necklace, a tiny 
little necklace with a little hear t. They wanted me
 Œ they were very anxious, that never they 
should take  away this necklace, because I told 
them this necklace, my husband gave it to me  
when we got ma rried, and he said, ﬁas long as 
you will have it, it will always bring you luck 
and save you.ﬂ And this is what
 they wrote in. And when I went
 back, they were excited and 
happy that I still had my necklace, 
and I still saved this ‚til today. 
Q:  And what is this? 

A: Yes, that locket.  
Q: You™ve had that locket
 for sixty-some-odd years. 
A:  Yes, you™re right. I don™t wear it anymore, I™m
 so afraid it will rip or  Œ I hide it away. 
Q: Is this one of your most valuable possessions? 
A: Yes, yes, it is. Can you understand? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0414  
67 
 
Q: Yes. Is it ma ybe your mo st precious? 
A: Probably,yes. 
Q: Can you say that in a sentence? 
A:  Yes, it is the most precious what I have. And 
that I have Eddie. But that passport is Œ very 
hard. There™s Muriel, who gave us life, 
that we are here. There™s that consul. 
Q: So, you have little mi racles. 
A: Yeah, what I just wanted to tell you is, like I sa
id, is just these mi racles. It™s not only that you 
think of a miracle Œ well, I got such a mi racle.
 It™s just a point, to suddenly find Muriel, and 
she said, ﬁCan I help you? ﬂ and when I 
see her, I don™t know who she was. Do you 
understand? 
Q: You didn™t even have an idea who she was. 
A: And there was some thing out, that miracle. Fr
om the blue sky, that 
I get a letter, ﬁYou are 
allowed to finish or get your doctorate.ﬂ You s
ee that I got it. This pa
ssport from the consul, 
it™s holy to me. 
Eddie: You know, I wouldn™t be
 alive if Muriel hadn™t 
given me  my affidavit. 
Q:  Right. 

A: Here, it was not just a Nazi 
Œ here it is the highest Nazi, 
the consul. Why?  Why is it me?  
Why a m I safe?   
Q: And what do you come  up with as an answer? 
A: I sort of think there are no answers. Maybe
 we do not know it yet. Maybe it mi ght be because 
I have a daughter, Karen. Maybe it might
 be Œ who knows Œ Laura, my grandchild.
