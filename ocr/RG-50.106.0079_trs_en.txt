lived there with my moth

d we Œ we f Œ we left 
Germany
 
in 1939, wh en co nditions got very
 bad, and my  parents always Œ 
Q: 1939? 
A: I™m sorry, it™s 1936. 1936, when co
nditions were beginning to  get somewhat 
difficult as far as business and just being a Jew in 
Germany
. 
Q: Do you have brot
hers or sisters? 
A: No, I was an only child, pr
obably because of the situa
tion, the political situation 
in 
Germany
 at the time. 
Q: You think th at your parents might

Germany
? 
A: Briefly, yes. In fact, we visited it, my
 home again just last August when we were 
in 
Germany
. It was a Œ a stone house, two storie
s, with a large ya
rd in the back, a 
large garden in the b
ack. And in  the front was the Œ was a butcher™s store, which my  
grandparents had run for many years, and thei
r parents had run before that. And that 
butcher store still exists; someone™s still 
in there. My grandfather had sold th at

busin ess to his appren tice shortly after we
 left Œ about the time when we left 
Germany
 in 1936.  
Q: So at the time that you 
were living there, your grandfather owned the butcher 
shop in the front of your house? 
A: Yes. Yes, yes. 

Q: And who lived in  the house? 

A: Just my  Œ my  parents with my  grand Œ with my  gran dfather. 
Q: So, your grandfather, 
your parents and you? 
A: Yes. 
Q: And you Œ 
A: My grandfather was widowed. 
Q: And bef Œ before we started the 
interview, you mentioned a nanny? 

A: Yes, yes, because my mother was work
 Œ worked. In fact, 
she helped in the 
store, and did the bookkeeping and the vari
ous other tasks. Sh Œ she hired a local 
girl, she was about Œ well, let™s see, sh
e™s 81 Œ well, she™s 82 now actually, she Œ 
her birthday  was la Œ la Œ in September. 
So she would have been 82. So  she would 

have been what, seven Œ four Œ 15 years ol
d at the time. And sh
e stayed with us 
until we left Œ until we left 
Germany
. 
Q: Did she live in 
Euro pe
?

A: Yes, yes, yes. 
Q: Oh, so sh e was living in  Œ 

A: No, she does not Œ no, sh
e wasn™t living in the home,
 she was a local girl, she 
lived nearby. Her parents lived at a nearby 
sh Œ her mother was Œ was left with a 

large family, and a Œ a sick husband, and so
 th e children had to be Œ had to wo rk 
rather early to help her ma
ke a living. She used to Œ 
cleaning and things like that, 
and so and Œ so 
Ha n i
(ph) came every mo rn ing, and left every evening.  
Q: And that was from Œ 

A: From shortly Œ 

Q: Œ the time you were how old? 
A: Œ shortly after I was born, til we left 
Germany
 in 1936. In fact, when we spoke 
with her this time on our visit, she recalle
d many of the incidents just before that. 
The fact that the 
Brownshirts
 were, during the boycott of Jewish stores, were 
standing outside the store and th at she trie
d Œ they tried to discourage people from 
going in, but she came in anyw
ay to help, every day. An
d she still had photographs 
of me when I was Œ one was when I was 
about five years old, and another one, 
which was a sort of a group picture when I was shu Œ probably ab out one year old. 
Q: Now, what do you remember from yo
ur Œ from those first six years?

A: Well, I can rememb er living in the 
house, and I had a room there. I can 
reme mb er looking out the window of my  ro
om and looking out into the garden  in 
the back. And living there, I 
reme mb er one incident partic
ularly because it™s one of 
those things that stays in 
your mind. I mu st have been probably  four years old, 
something like that, and the kitchen was two 
steps down from the level of the store, 
and I would sometimes rush into th e kitchen 
from the store, and I fell. I fell flat on 
my face. I can rememb er that so vividl
y because I Œ you know, blood all over the 
place, I fell right Œ my nose was bleeding. 
And that™s one of my earliest memories 
of an event that 
occurred there.  
Q: How old do you 
think you were? 
A: I think I was about four, four and a half, probably. 
Q: And what happened after you 
fell? Do you remember that? 
A: Oh, my mother, you know, 
came up to comfort me and 
my  grandfather ran out to 
comfort me. And what was interesting was, 
in 1983, when we visited the home for 
the first time, the people are Œ who are 
living in there are descendants from my  
grandfather™s apprentice. And, it was the 
son of the appren tice who was running the 
store then and shortly now Œ s
hortly, he Œ he had, before 
we came, he had turned the 
busin ess over to his son, w
ho unfortunately though, had a 
heart attack and died very 
rec Œ just recently, shortly be
fore we came. B u t back in 
1983, when we 
came in, the

appre Œ th -the Œ my  father Œ gran dfather™s 
apprentice was still alive. He was an o Œ 
very old man, but unfortunately his memo
ry was gone. But the Œ his Œ his son still 
remembered my grandfather. 
And he rememb ered that my grandfather, after we had 
left, my  Œ the people, the older people Œ 
I don™t rememb er exac
tly when, but some 
time shortly after we left, they were Œ the 
Jewish people were sent to what was then 
the Jewish old age home in 
Aachen
. They were all collected, and they were c Œ 
there. And he says he can remember my
 grandfather coming to the house because 
they didn™t get ve Œ enough food to  eat. 
He would come to the house there and ask 
them if he could eat with them, becaus
e they were not getting enough fo od. And 
that was pros Œ as I recall was about 1940
 - ™41. And then  after awhile, this ma n 
said, your grandfather ju st didn™t come
 any more, so we didn™t know what 
happened, except they had h
eard that the Jews had been  taken away. And as it 
turned out, the records now show
 th at they™d  been taken to 
Theresienstadt
. I also 
can remember going to school shortly be
fo re we left. The school year in Œ in 
Germany 
starts right after Easter. And we left 
Germany
 in early summer. So I had 
to go to school briefly, and I can rememb
er that my  father was concerned about me 
and my  going to  school. I had to take a tram
 to get to school. And he rode behind 
the tram on a bicycle every day to just 
observe that nothing would occur. And then 
would meet the tram sometime on the wa
y back, when I came back from school.

Q: Was it required by the scho
ol that you go on th e tram? 
A: Yes, the school was too far for me to 
walk. That™s the reason I had to take a 
tram. 
Q: And there would be no other wa
y for you to be transported? 
A: Get there, no, no. 
Q: And did you know that your fa
ther was following on a bicycle? 

A: Yes, I did know that. 
Q: Why didn™t he just get on th e tram with you? 
A: Well, I Œ I™m not sure. I think he just 
didn™t want to Œ to Œ at first, I just 
[indecipherable]
 about somewhat later. Initially I 
think he just didn™t want to get 
me concerned that he felt that uneasy, that 
I would have to Œ that
 he would have to 
follow. 

Q: So he was trying to help you be independent? 

A: Yes, yes, I think so. And it™s al so th
at I wouldn™t have those concerns. I can 
reme mb er this Œ so I only went to school 
very Œ a few months. Maybe, at mo st two, 
before we left 
Germany
 to go to 
Palestine
. 
Q: What do you rememb er about the school? 
A: I can remember th ey had a large, open co
urtyard. At least it seemed large to me 
at the time, probably wasn™t
 that large, you know. At 
this time Œ the school is no

longer there. It was a Jewish school, a
nd Œ a Jewish elementary school, wh ich was 
not uncommon in 
Germ any
, they were that Œ that Œ th
ere Œ even before the Nazi 
times this 
[indeciphera ble]
 there were schools that were, you know, t Œ even today 
they have parochial school supported by th e 
state, and so that the Jew Œ the Jewish 
schools were also partly supported by the 
state. And I do reme mb er going to  school 
very briefly. I don™t rememb er too mu ch, 
except that I was very unhappy going to  
school. That™s the only time that I was 
unhappy going to sc
hool, I always liked 
going to  school later.  
Q: And what was there that Œ 

A: So I must have been some concern. 
Q: What Œ do you have
 any memory of wh at there wa
s about the school that you 
were feeling unhappy? 
A: I really don™t know. I™m really not sure
 why that was. Perhaps I had a feeling of 
the uneasiness of my  parents, because by th
at time my father ha
d been forced to 
close the store in 
Aa chen
 already, that we had. Anot
her store, he had two stores. 
And he only had the store no
w in Œ in the part Œ in 
Eilendorf
. And I suspect that I 
felt some of the uneasiness of Œ that my  parents mu st have had. 
Q: Do you reme mb er anything about th
e school, other than the playground? 

 
Interview with Kurt Pauly 
 
 
Novemb er 18

11
A: Well, I remember b eing in the classroom
. I don™t rememb er too mu ch about what 
occurred. I remember 
when we Œ first day that I was there, I do have one memory. 
Walked into the classroom 
and on the blackboard there wa
s a drawing done in chalk 
of a Œ of a little boy and a little girl. I guess the teacher had done th at, I can recall 
that Œ seeing that. I don™t rememb er anythi
ng really about Œ else about the school. 
Q: Do you reme mb er any 
of the other children? 
A: Not really, not really. 
Q: And outside of school, 
did you have playmates? 
A: Yes, I Œ well, my cousins lived in 
Eilendorf
. My mo ther had a si Œ a sister 
whose family also lived in 
Eilendorf
, and th  Œ she had three children. And so I can 
reme mb er playing with them, and I™m Œ don™
t particularly rememb er other people 
except now, recently we rece
ived a letter from someone who had seen the article 
about our trip to 
Aa chen
, and sh e wrote us a letter. She also knew my  Œ my  nanny, 
because her mother, my nanny™s mother, ha
d been  a domestic in their house, and 

she wrote him the letter that she ha
d sometimes played with me because 
Hani
(ph), 
who was the Œ who was the nanny. And she se
nt me a picture, a class picture that 
she had, wh ich had Œ which included 
my  elder cousin, my  oldest cousin  
Ilsa
, who 
was a classmate of hers. So she was about 
three years older than I was. And then 

 
Interview with Kurt Pauly

she had a brother and sister who were younger than the brother 
Eric
, was about my 
age, and I can rememb er playing with him. 
Q: Now, was she Jewish? 
A: This woman? No, she was not Jewish. No
, no. No , no. And she wrote to us that 
she can remember meeting the 
Kunn
(ph) family, that was their name, in 
Aachen
 
later when she so
metimes would go in  with her mo ther
 after they had been forced to 
leave 
Eilendorf
, and I guess they were Œ ma Œ they 
Œ they  mu st have been gathered 
in some places. All the Jews must have b
een gathered there, 
and she can remember 
though, meeting 
Ilsa
 on the street sometimes for a 
short period of time during Œ I 
guess in the early 40s. So she 
had that memo ry. So  she sent me a very nice letter, 
and she had spoken with me, 
and she thought I might be in
terested in having that 
picture of my  Œ of my cousin, which of cour
se we were very interested in seeing it.  
Q: Was your family religious? 

A: No, no, my family 
was not Œ the Jews of 
Aach en
 were what we would call in 
this country, Reform. And th
e Œ my Œ my father™s family
 had been  mo re religious, 
although my  father was not particularly 
religious, although we 
would Œ we went to 
synagogue. And Œ but we woul
d have Œ we Œ the synagogue
 was too far to walk, so 
we would have to drive there. So no, th
e Œ this Œ the Œ the Jew Œ the Jews of 
Aach en
 Œ there were very few religious Jews in 
Aa chen
, most of them were

13
Reform. And th en Œ that community had be
en there for quite so
me time, certainly 
since the middle of the 18
th
 century.  
Q: Do you reme mb er anything
 specific about the closing in of the Nazis when you 
were in 
Aachen
? 
A: Not Œ no, I don™t rememb er it particul
arly from firsth and experiences except my 
Œ of course, my  parents talked ab
out it from time to time later on. 
Q: But you don™t rememb er hearing th em
 talk about it when you were a child? 
A: I Œ no, no, I don™t remember hearing it 
firsthand. I do remember o u r trip when 
we left 
Germany
, I can remember that. I can reme
mb er going to  say goodbye to my  
grandmother, my father™s mother, who was still living in 
Wurzburg 
at that time, 
and taking th e train down th ere to say goodbye to them. 
Q: What was your understanding at the 
time of why you and 
your parents were 
leaving, and not your grandparents? 

A: I don™t know that I Œ I had th at particul
ar understanding of Œ at Œ at that age, of 
why that happened. Of course 
later my parents told me th
at these people, they didn™t 
want to go along, they thou
ght, you know, things would be all right, and they  were 
old people, and they  felt nothing would happ
en to them. And so I don™t particularly 
know, except I do know my  parents spoke about
 it. My father tried very hard to  get 
them to leave. And by the time,
 of course, they wanted to
 leave, it w as too late. We 

 
Interview with Kurt Pauly

were in 
Palestine 
by then, of course, but Œ an d even wh en we came to the 
United 
States
 in 1938, it was too late for them to
 leave, they couldn™t get out.  
Q: And do you remember
 what you were told
 about the leaving? 
A: No, not really firsth and, I really don
™t know. Later, of course, I learned, you 
know, about it from my pa
rents. And I heard from 
Hani
(ph), 
Hani
(ph) 
Dover
, the Œ 
my  nanny, she told us when  Œ on th is last 
visit sh-she can reme
mb er th at wh en  my  
father decided to leave, telling them that 
he was leaving because 
there was no future 
in 
Germany
 for his son and his family. So my
 father decided to leave in 19 Œ 
actually, he told us that he wanted to le
ave already in 1933, 
but it took him three 
year Œ almost three years to 
get it togeth er and to find a pl
ace to go. At that time we 
couldn™t come to the 
United States
 because we had no fam
ily here. Later, we were 
Œ I th Œ my  uncle, my  father™s brother ca
me to this country  thro ugh his wife™s 
family and that™s how we came to this c
ountry  then, th rough my  aunt™s family, who 
were not Jewish, by the way. They  provided 
an affidavit for my 
aunt™s family and Œ 
and two of her sisters, and their family, 
and for us. Wh ich was quite something to 
do, because giving an affidavit me
ant you were taking a responsibility. 
Q: So you left for 
Palestine
 in 1936? 
A: That™s correct. 
Q: And do you remember any feeli
ngs about saying goodbye, or Œ 

 
Interview with Kurt Pauly

15
A: Yes. I was a little u nhappy leaving my 
grandparents, I can remember, especially 
my  grandmother, because that was a big trip to go to 
Wu rzb u rg
 and to say 
goodbye, and th en we Œ and I can reme mb
er going to  my  grandmother before th at. 
In fact, I even have a memory of play
ing with a Œ she had 
a little red wind-up car, 
and I can remember playing w
ith that in her apartment, 
which overlooked a square 
called the 
Figurenbrunnen
. I can Œ and I can still remember looking down there 
and seeing the fountain in the center of th
e square and all the traffic and activity that 
was going on th ere. And going with my  fath
er down to the river, which was not far 
from the Œ from the house. So 
I have memories of that. 
Q: So, describe the trip to Œ 
A: 
Palestine
? 
Q: Œ 
Palestine
, from leaving 
Aachen
. 
A: We went by train to 
Italy
, and left from Œ trying to think which Œ which port we 
left from. I Œ I believe we left from
 Genoa
. 
Q: Did you have any favorite thin
gs that you took with you? 
A: I must have, but I don™t remember. 
Q: Okay . 
A: But I remember th ere Œ on th
e Œ being on the boat from Œ from 
Italy 
to Œ to 
Palestine
. It was very warm, and in fact we ha
ve pictures of the family on the boat, 

 
Interview with Kurt Pauly

sitting there in our bathing suits, by the 
side of the pool on the boat. And I can 
remember that, and I can reme
mb er being, of course in 
Palestine
, and going to 
school in 
Palestine
, and living there. My father 
had a nephew who was already in 
Palestine
, and my  mother had co
usins who had gone to 
Palestine
 very early. They 
were ardent Zionists, and th ey had gone th
ere in the 20s, and in fact one of the 
cousins whom we met on so me of our trips back to 
Palestine
, my mother™s cousin, 
founded Œ was a founder of a kibbutz, Kibbutz 
Yavne
, and he had a very large 
family, which we met when we were ther
e. And my  mo th er™s brother went to 
Palestine
 just after we left 
Palestine
 to come to the 
United Sta tes
. He went there 
with his family. And his son is my  only liv
ing cousin Œ first c
ousin. And we™re still 
in touch with him, and we see him frequen
tly. He™s with the Israeli foreign service 
and we met him in 
Germany
 twice on trips over to 
Euro pe
, and he™s been to the 
States
 frequently, because one of his daught
ers is married and her husband is 
studying here in the 
United Sta tes
. 
Q: Now, wh en you arrived in 
Palestine
, what port did you Œ 
A: 
Haifa
.  
Q: In 
Ha ifa
. 
A: Yes, and we lived  in 
Ha ifa
. 
Q: And had arrangements been 
made before you got there? 

 
Interview with Kurt Pauly

A: I believe so. My parents rented an apar
tment, I think throu
gh my Œ my father™s 
nephew, my  cousin. His name was 
Walter
 and he was married to an Israeli w o man. 
So they had been th
ere some time and I believe they
 had helped my  parents make 
arrangements. And my  father tried to s 
Œ started a business with this nephew. 
Q: And where did he get the money to start a busin ess? 
A: Well, at that time y ou 
could take your money from 
Germa ny
. In 1936, you 
could still take your 
Œ your Œ your m
oney out. So he had take
n that along, and he 
had Œ well, he Œ they  chur 
Œ they  went into  the trucking business. They  bought a 
truck, they Œ they 
imported a truck from 
Germany
. It was one of the assets my  
father took with him. And I can remember
 going along with them on th e truck. Bu t 
they Œ the Œ the work that th
at they did was they got a contract with a soft drink 
distributor, and they  would truck th e soft 
drinks. Unfortunately this was the time of 
the depression, and economic cond
itions were not very  good in 
Palestine
, in the Œ 
in the Œ in that time period. And so the 
business was not very good. And my  father 
was Œ always said we could compute almo st
 to the day wh en he™d spend his last 
piasta 
in  
Palestine
, because they just simply couldn™t make a living. And I think 
that was the principle reason then, that he left 
Palestine
, was economic. 
Q: How long were you in 
Palestine
? 
A: Two and half years.

Q: From ™36 Œ 
A: To Œ to late ™38. 

Q: Mm-hm. And Œ 
A: Just a little over Œ just over two years. 
Q: So you were six when
 you arrived. And did y
ou start school right away? 
A: Yes, yes, Yes, I did. 

Q: Do you remember that? 
A: Yes, I can rememb er that, and I can re
member that first I was a lot happy going 
to school because I couldn™t unders
tand the teacher, they were speaking 
Ivrit
, I 
couldn™t speak any 
Iv r i t
. But apparently I mu st have learned it very quick ly, 
children learn very quickly. And I was ve
ry happy going to school after that. 
Q: What about your pare
nts with the language? 
A: They never really got to
 be very proficient in 
Ivrit
. But then in 
Haifa
 there was a 
large German colony, and so you coul
d get along pretty well with German. 
Q: But your father knew enough of th
e language to get along in business? 
A: Yes, yes, yes. 

Q: And Œ 
A: And of course my  neph
ew Œ his nephew helped him 
along with that, he spoke 
Ivrit
 quite fluently.

Q: And did you make 
friends in school? 
A: Oh yes, oh yes, we had a lot of frie
nds, and my  par Œ but as Œ as Œ and my  
parents, of cour Œ had fri
ends. Most of them, of co
urse, were immigrants like 
themselves. And because conditions were so 
difficult that my parents also, to help 
make a little money, rented out one of the bedrooms in the apartment to a young 
man who was from 
Austria
. And he lived there with pa
rtial board. So that helped 
them earn some money to help pay for th
e expenses, and that™s how they managed 
to eke out some of 
the living, as well. 
Q: And how did your mo
ther spend her time? 
A: Well, partly, you know, provide Œ provid
ing fo r this board er. And also ag ain, to 
help make a living, they would Œ my  fath
er had been a prof Œ was a professional 
chef, they would have dinners that peopl
e could come to, about once a week, for 
pay, or for money. And so th
at they took in paying guests
, so to speak for Œ once a 
week for a meal. And that
 helped them as well. 
Q: Do you reme m Œ re
memb er the dinners? 
A: Oh yes, I can reme
mb er so me o f  th em. 
Q: Is that fun for you? 
A: Sometimes, and sometimes of course it 
was too late for me to stay up. And I 
remember that they put me
 to sleep out on the vera
nda, out on th e porch , because

the people were in the apartment. And 
I remember going to sleep outside. But I 
guess it was fun for a little boy. 
Q: Wh-What else  was fun for you in 
Palestine
? 
A: Well, just playing around Œ 

Q: Like what kind of play? 

A: Œ and going to school. 

Q: What did you like to play? 
A: Well, what do children do, children 
get together and they play games. 
Q: Like what kind of games? 
A: I Œ really Œ well, you know, hide and s
eek, and those kind of games that Œ some 
ball. And then so I™ve Œ wh en Œ wh en my  
parents told me that they were leaving 
Palestine
, of course I was Œ at that time, then 
I was rather sad to leave, because of 
my friends. 

Q: So you Œ so you remember th at? 
A: Yes, I do remember that. I remember le
 Œ that departure. And I can remember 
the trip to the 
United States
 because then I was quite 
old enough to Œ to Œ to 
remember that.

A: The answering machine will take it. Yes,
 that trip was Œ I have more memories 
of that trip. 
Q: And more memories of the leavin
g and feeling sad about the leaving. 
A: Yes, yes, yes, yes. Although my Œ bei
ng with my parents, of course, made it, you 
know, easier. And I can remember then, 
we went by boat to mars Œ from 
Haifa
 to 
Marseilles
. And from 
Marseilles
 overland to 
Paris
, where we stayed a couple of 
days, waiting fo r the ship
 which was leaving from 
Le Havre
.  
Q: Now this was in 1939? 

A: 1938. 

Q: ™38. 
A: Late ™38. 
Q: And so you were staying overnight in Œ 

A: Winter ™38. 

Q: Œ

. 
A: We spent a couple of days in Œ in  
Paris
. No, we didn™t stay in marse Œ I can™t 
reme mb er s t ay in g  in  
Marseilles
. I think we just got 
on the train and went 
immediately to 
Paris
, where we stayed for 
a couple of days be
cause the ship, which 
was the Queen
 Mary
, didn™t leave 
Le Havre
 for several days after our arrival, and

then we got on the sh ip. And that was quite
 an adventure for a little boy, such a big 
ship. 
Q: What was that like for you? 
A: Oh, I had a wonderful time on the ship, 
although the Œ the passage was a little bit 
s Œ it was a little bit stormy on that passa
ge, but the Œ I didn™t particularly get 
seasick, but my parents did have a little 
bit of seasickness. I can remember there 
were a lot of activities for children. Th
ey had organized play. I can remember 

playing on the ship with so
me of the other children. And it was by f Œ I can still 
remember that it was the first time I ever ate 
Brussels
 sprouts was on the Queen
 
Mary
. I didn™t know what 
Brussels 
sprouts were until I got on the Queen 
Mary
. 
And then  we arrived in 
New York
. But I guess it was Œ trip was Œ th-the Queen 
Mary  
was rather fast, it was like five and a half days to get to 
New York
 from 
Le 
Havre
. And there we stayed, in 
New York
 for a couple of days, and th en went by 
train to 
Cincinnati
, which was where my uncle wa
s living, and we moved to  
Cincinnati
,
 Ohio
. And I can remember that ve
ry well, and I grew up in 
Cincinnati
 
through high school. I was 
18 years old wh en we left 
Cincinnati
 to go to 
New 
Jersey
. 
Q: So you arrived in 
Cincinnati
 when  you were about nine? 
A: Actually about eight and a half. 

 
Interview with Kurt Pauly

Q: Eight and a half. So you were
 there eight and a half to 18. 
A: Yes. Almost 10 years. 
Q: Did you know any En
glish when you were Œ 
A: No, I knew no English when I arrived, 
and of course I had 
to go to school. And 
because I spoke no En
glish, they decided th at I shoul
d Œ although I was eight and a 
half, to put me in the first 
grade. Now there was a little b oy in the school who was a 
Œ who sp oke German, and helped  me unde
rstand what the teacher was saying. 
Q: Was he in first grade? 

A: Yes, he was in first grade. 

Q: This is public school. 
A: Public school. Wh ich is not that unusual in 
Cincin nati
. 
Cincinnati
 had a long 
history of German immigration. 
There were a lot of people in 
Cincinnati
 who  
spoke German, even though th ey were not 
Œ you know, they may 
be second or even 
third generation American. So this little 
boy spoke German and helped me, and of 
course once I learned English, then they
 moved me to the second and th ird grad e 
very quick ly. 

Q: Were you friends with him outside 
of school also, or just in school? 
A: Actually not, because he lived Œ he di
dn™t live nearby, but I made other friends. 
And this little boy was much yo
unger than I was, and once I moved out of the first

grade, I sort of lost touch 
with him. But Œ and my  parents, of course, had to start 
again, and that was economically very diffi
cult to make a living at that time in the 
United States
 because of the depression. And 
my parents had Œ took my parents 
awhile. My father, as I say, was a professiona
l chef, but he couldn™t get a job in that 
field at the time, immediately. It was very 
interesting. So he tr
 Œ got various jobs 
doing th ings, and one ti Œ one job that he ma
naged to get was in a large cafeteria. 
And he says all he ever did was peel pot
atoes and on Œ cut up onions. He said, but 
was one good th ing about cu
tting up onions, because he 
always got a seat on the 
trolley going back  because he smelled so 
of onions, nobody wanted to sit next to 
him. But one day, he tells the story, he
 met someone on the street, and Œ that he 
knew from 
Euro pe
. A man that had been  with him in 
Switze rland
 where they had 
learned their trade together. This man wa
s a chef in one of 
the large hotels in 
Cincinnati
, and wh en he met my  father he as
ked him what he was doing, and how 
things were. My father, of course, told hi
m how difficult it was for him to get a job. 
He said well, he said, meet
 me in the union hall next Wednesd ay. And he got him a 
job as a cook in one of th
e restaurants in downtown 
Cincinnati
, where my father 
then eventually becam
e the chef. So that™s how he 
did it, how it ha
ppened that he 
got a job even during the depression, throu
gh a friend, or an acquaintance, that man

he had studied with in 
Switzerland
. So after that things got a little b etter, 
economically. 
Q: So th at would have been wh en? 
A: Well, actually, that pr
obably  happened in  1939. 
Q: So th at was soon after you arrived. 
A: It was about a year, little less 
than a year after we arrived.  
Q: So what was it like for you, 
in as far as making friends? 
A: Well, made friends very quick ly. 

Q: Even though you had a language problem at first? 

A: Well, the Œ the language problem went aw
ay very qui Œ very quickly. I Œ I don™t 
remember that was a problem. And there were
 Œ in the area we lived in, there were 
a lot of other immigrants as well as people who sp oke German.  

Q: So would Œ 

A: But I spoke English very  quickly. 
Q: So did your friends tend 
to be also immigrants?  
A: Yes, most of Œ most of them were, most
 o f them were, because they were also Œ 
Q: Jews, or not Jews? 

A: Yes, most of them were Jewish. It was 
a predominantly Jewish 
area that we lived 
in in 
Cincin nati
 called
 Av onda le
. At that time it was very Jewish. I Œ going to walk

Œ I rememb er walking to high school I wo
uld pass three synagogues on the way to Œ 
walking to high school. 

Q: Now, was your family involved  with th e synagogue? 
A: Yes, yes, yes. They were then. It wa
s interesting. The immi
grants Œ the German 
Jewish immigrants started a congregation of 
their own, so my  pa
rents felt that they 
wanted to support this, a
lthough they weren™t Orth
odox Œ it was an Orthodox 
congregation Œ but they  felt they wanted to
 support the congre Œ that congreg ation, 
and I Œ and so then they  did get involved. 
Q: And what about you? 

A: And I can rememb er going Œ yes, we we
nt to a synagogue. I used to go to 
synagogue on Saturd ays and because also my
 friends went. Even though my parents 

didn™t always go because it Œ because of Œ 
of Œ of work. Later my father left the 
restaurant and started a bake
ry of his own, with a partner, someone he knew, an  
acquaintance. And so of course then they
 were working six days a week. So he 
would not be Œ he wouldn™t go
 to synagogue that frequently. 
Q: So you went with  your 
parents when they went. Do 
Œ were you involved with Œ 
A: No, sometimes I would 
go without my  parents. 
Q: With your friends or by yourself? 

A: Yes Œ no, with my friends, we™d meet
 my  fren Œ I™d meet my friends there.

Q: And were you involved in any ch
ildren™s activities at the synagogue? 
A: The synagogue didn™t have any particular
 Œ that much in th
e way of children™s 
activities. We had other activities through,
 you know, thr-through the school, and I 
made other friends in school, and so th
ey Œ they weren™t necessarily really 
connected with 
the synagogue. 
Q: Did you have a Bar Mitzvah? 
A: Yes, yes, we did. 
Q: Do you remember that? 
A: Yes, I can rememb er that very well. Of 
course, it wasn™t as elaborate an affair as 
Bar Mitzvahs are today. First of all, 
it wasn™t customary then, and beside my 
parents weren™t going to  spend that kind 
of money on a Bar Mitzvah. Bu t I can 
remember friends and family ad Œ coming 
to th e apartment, and my  parents had a 
kiddush, and Œ and th en a meal for the 
family  afterwards in the apartment. 

Q: And do you remember ho
w you felt about all that? 
A: Oh, I was very excited, because of cour
se, I got a lot Œ a number of gifts. And it 
was very ex citing having all those people th
ere and being th e center of attention. I 
guess I can remember that very well.  

Q: We have to turn over the tape.

Q: Œ tinuation of a 
United States
 
Holocaust Memorial Museum 
volunteer 
collection interview with 
Kurt Pauly
, tape number one, side 
B
. Okay. 
A: Okay, because of the 
difficult economic conditions 
when we first came, and 
particularly before my  father got a good jo
b as a cook, my  mo ther also went out to 
work  as a domestic on a day Œ day Œ daily 
basis. And I can rememb er going to so me 
of the homes where she was wo
rking when  I got out of scho
ol, so that I wouldn™t be 
at home alone. And she did that for some 
years to help supple
ment my father™s 
income. As well as, ag ain, renting out Œ we
 took a very large ap
artment in the same 
house wh ere my  uncle lived, and my  parents 
rented out two of the bedrooms to help 
pay for their expenses as well at that time.
 A nd those were rented out for quite a few 
years until things got a little better and we 
no longer needed 
to do that. I can 
reme mb er making friends with  a Œ with th e people wh o Œ who rented the rooms, 
and they stayed for quite aw
hile, so they must have be
en fairly happy living with 
my  parents. So that we had an  el
derly lady there I remember, a Mrs. 
Scholl
(ph), 
who was an American woman who I guess 
was re Œ living as Œ she was widowed. 
And she always told  me her husband ha
d been a drummer boy in the Civil War. 
And we had another wo man, a Mrs. 
Stern
, who was an immigrant. And she was a

rather Œ she was not Œ later on she got rath
er sickly, and unfortunately Œ and left 
because of illness. And we made friends w
ith her family as well; she had a son. And 
actually my  parents got to be very  friendl
y with them Œ with those people as well. 
They became more th an just
 board ers, they be Œ sort of became friends. And of 
course later things got bette
r, my  parents didn™t have to rent out ro oms any mo re. 
But of course as a child I never felt partic
ularly depriv ed or 
poor because I was Œ 
we were, you know, at least comfortable,
 and I Œ I guess people around me didn™t 
have any mo re than we had, so Œ 

Q: You mean your friends at school? 

A: Friends, right, friends at school and peop
le that my  parents knew that I came  to 
contact with. So I guess even at the beginn
ing, although my  pare
nts had a very  hard 
time economically, didn™t seem to make that
 much of a proble
m for me initially. 
Q: Do you reme mb er having any awareness at
 that time of what was going on in  the 
rest of world? 
A: Yes, of course, and as Œ as I Œ as I 
grew older, I can reme
mber, well, whenthe 
war started, 1939, and my  parents 
[indecipherable]
 of course, at that time, and their 
concerns with the people that they had left in 
Euro pe
, their family. And I can Œ my 
mo ther was, of course Œ my  mo ther was 
a somewhat of a di Œ rather depressed 
personality, and that didn™t get 
any better as she aged. But 
I can remember th at they 

 
Interview with Kurt Pauly 
 
 
Novemb er 18
,

30
had a great deal of concerns about people 
they left behind, their parents and their 
families. 

Q: And how did that affect you? 
A: Well, not so much directly
 when you™re a child, that so
rt of Œ you know, it™s sort 
of there, but it Œ it doesn™t have that 
much impact on you. Although I ca Œ I could 
remember my grandparents and I Œ I reme
mber their concern. So  some of those 
concerns did rub off on me, but as a child
 I Œ it Œ you don™t feel any responsibility 
for it, so Œ but I can remember th e wa
r going on, and then  of course, I can 
reme mb er d i stin c
tly  wh en  Œ  wh en 
Pearl Ha rbor
 occurred. That was on that 
Sunday, because I had gone 
with my father on that 
Su nday to Œ to  see a new 
restaurant that they were Œ 
that the Œ that thas Œ those 
people were opening, people 
that my father worked for, and he want
ed to  check out, see how it™s com Œ was 
coming along. And so that Su
nday we took a trip to th
e new restaurant, which was 
out in th e suburb s. And wh en we came b
ack there was all this hubbub and people 
talking and te
lling us that 
Pearl Ha rbor
 had been attacked. So I can remember that 
very distinctly. Of course, during the war 
then, of course, I can remember Œ well, 
we had rationing, so  that was a problem of 
sorts, for everyone. And of course my Œ 
you know, not knowing how lo ng the war 
would last, I guess my  parents already 
began to have some concerns about this 
happening Œ their son perh aps drafted at

some time into the war, although th at didn™t
 occur at that time, although later I was 
drafted during the Korean War. But then it™s 
Œ but I was going to high school, and I 
enjoyed going to  high school very  mu ch 
[indecipherable]
. In fact, I enjoyed going 
to school period in 
Cincinnati
. It was a very good experience. 
Q: What did you like about it? 

A: I just enjoyed learning. I was a good 
student and I en joyed it and I Œ the schools 
were challenging and Œ and I just enjoyed 
it. The high school I went to Œ well, 
actually it was a comb ination junior high Œ 
high. It was a school Œ although a public 
school, it was a school you had to enter 
by competitive exam. And, you know, three 
years of Latin were still required. And so 
I can remember the te Œ the Latin teacher 
telling us how fortunate we lu Œ we were 
that two years of Greek were no longer 
required. Bu t it was a good school, and I en
joyed going there. Even though it was a 
good walk to school, but Œ 

Q: So you enjoyed the academic life. 
A: Yes, I did, I did. 
Q: And what about the Œ 

A: And the friends. 
Q: Œ extracurricular part? 

 
Interview with Kurt Pauly 
 
 
Novemb er 18
,

32
A: We enjoyed that. I went with my friends
 and although not all of my friends then 
went to that particular high school, some
 of them went to one of the other high 
schools. I enjoyed Œ I enjo
yed going to  the school, and 
you know, being a teenager. 
I also helped my parents 
later in the bakery which 
they opened up, and I would 
work  there after school and 
on weekends, helping out. 
Q: So did th at cut in
to your social time? 
A: A little bit, but not too ba
dly, not too badly. My pare
nts were understanding and 
th-they didn™t want me to work all the tim
e. So I don™t remember that that was a 
particular problem. 

Q: Now how was it for you as far as 
being a German Jewish immi grant? 
A: Well, bec Œ we were surrounded by a lo
t of people in the same b o at. And so it 
wasn™t a particular problem. 

Q: Did you feel discrimination? 

A: No, no, I can™t remember 
feeling any discrimination at 
all. It was Œ it was a very 
Œ basically a Œ a pretty good time, except
 the problems that my  parents had then  
later with Œ when they lear
ned when the war was over a
nd th ey got indications of 
what had happened to  their families. Of c
ourse I remember that, that was Œ those 
were terrible times for my parents, and my mother Œ 

Q: Talk about that. 

 
Interview with Kurt Pauly 
 
 
Novemb er 18
, 
1997 
 
 
 
33
A: Well, she cried a great deal about it. Of  course, she cried very easily because she 
Œ she was a somewhat depressed person. Bu
t I™m sure that there were Œ you know, 
the Œ there were certainly ve
ry good reasons there to cry 
about that. And when she Œ 
she had always hoped that perhap s somebo
dy would have survived  the war, besides 
of Œ her brother, of course, had survived  in 
Palestine
. But that perhaps some of her 
nieces and nephews, these people Œ th
ese children that I 
played with in 
Eilendorf
 
had surv ived . Bu t sh Œ my  Œ my  Œ my  oldest cousin  
Ilsa
 was a Œ a great favorite of 
my  mo ther, and she always had some hope
 that perhap s one of the children had 
survived. But that was not 
to be, and later we found 
out when  we ch ecked the 
records, particularly here at the Holocaust
 Museum, there were indications that all 
of them had been  Œ you know, all of them
 had perished in the war. And of course, 
my mother, not Œ and of course my father™s 
family as well; he had the sister, and his 
mo ther and well, he had several sisters 
and their f Œ and all those people also 

perished. So that was a terrible, 
y ou know, feeling for my parents. 
Q: And how was it for you? 

A: Well, you know, children don™t in-inter
nalize that as much. And it Œ although I 

knew, you know, it was Œ it was bad, it Œ th
e impact on me was not as great because 
I had been  so young wh en we left, and so 
my  memo ries  o f  th ese 
people were rather 
limited. I mean, it was very, very st Œ 
you know, it Œ I me an, some of that

unhappiness obviously rubbed off on me and 
Œ but Œ and then by that time I was old 
enough to realize what that meant. But Œ 
but th at Œ it was, of course, mu ch mo re 
traumatic for my parents. Very traumatic 
for them. And Œ and of course, my  uncle™s 
family, as well, my aunt™s fa
mily. They also, of course, lo
st a lot of people in the 
Holocaust. 
Q: So at the end of th e war you would have
 been 15 Œ 16 when  your parents found 
out Œ 
A: Yes, yes, yes, yes, that™s right. So th
en, in the meantime, m-
my  father had started 
this bakery with an aqua Œ 
with a f Œ with a Œ an acquain tance, but they didn™t get 
along too well, as partners 
frequently do. And my father 
decided th en to get out of 
the bakery . And he sold  his interest to
 his partner, and he 
had had friends from 
Cincinnati
 that had moved to 
Vineland
, 
New Jersey
, and started a poultry farm 
during th e war. And th-they were always in 
touch with the Œ with
 these people, they 
were close friends. And they convinced them to come to 
Vineland
,
 New Jersey
 and 
also start a poultry farm, which turned  
out to be a big mistake because although 
during th e war those farms made a lot of bus
iness, after the war that business really 
faded. They couldn™t compete with th
e large farms in the Midwest and on the 
eastern shore of 
Maryland
. So unfortunately that was 
Œ turned  out to be a big

35
mistake for Œ for my parents,
 alth ough they made the be
st of it. Unfortunately my 
father died very young, at 62, of cancer. 
Q: That would have 
been how long ago? 
A: And that was in 1957, shortly before
 I graduated from school. What happened 
was, in 1951, I was Œ see, I Œ we left

Q: Now the year you left 
Cincinnati
 was? 
A: Was ™48. 

Q: ™48. So you had gra
duated from high school? 
A: I just graduated from high school in 1948. 
Q: Was that part of the timing that they wanted to Œ 
A: Yes, probably . 

Q: Œ stay in 
Cincinnati
 so you could graduate? 
A: Yes, I think that was probably part of it.
 I graduated in ™48, and then my  parents 
moved there. But tha-that was a bit of an upheaval for me. And as a result, if I™d 
stayed in 
Cincinna ti
, I™m sure I w ould have just 
gone to the University of 
Cincinnati
 right then and there. But because 
of that upheaval, I Œ moving to 
New 
Jersey
, I didn™t go to college at that time, a
nd I was a little confused  about wh at I 
wanted to do, as teenagers frequently are.
 And wh at happened  was, I got a job in

 as a sort of 
a Œ a runner, a boy, you know,
 in the office, and I would run errands and take out 
proofs of ads to advertisers to get their 
approval, and things like that. And did th at 
for a while, and then of course in 1951, 
I was drafted. It was the Korean War, and 
that was a quite traumatic 
for my parents, that Œ 
Q: Now, bef Œ before that, in the first few years in 
Vineland
, had you so rt of 
expected that you would continue in that di
rection, or did you 
think ab out going to 
college at some point Œ 

A: I did think ab out it, but I Œ I Œ I Œ it 
Œ because of the move
 perh aps, and Œ and 
then the other thing was, my
 parents found, as I said, the busin ess, the Œ the Œ the 
poultry business got Œ eggs bu
siness got to be rather poor, and they  had a great deal 
of difficulty making ends meet, so I went 
Œ decide well, I can just go out to work. 
That was probably part of that. 

Q: So you felt you had to 
help support the family? 
A: Well, at least support myself. So I did 
that, and then, as I say, I w as drafted in 
1951, and Œ 

Q: How did you feel 
about being drafted? 
A: Well, it sort of gave me a focus, ca
use now I had Œ had no choi Œ I knew wh at I 
was doing. And although 
my  parents of course, were 
very concerned. I mean, we

lost all these people in the war, and now 
th eir only son was going into  the service. 
And wh at happened was, I was sent to 
Arkansas
, Camp 
Chaffee
 for my Œ for my 
basic training. And decided to sign up for 
OCS
, Officers™ Candidate School. Took 
the test for 
OCS
 and was admitted  to a class which was to start about six weeks 
after my  basic training was to be comp leted.
 So in the meantime, 
I was sent to what 
was called leadership school, wh ich was re
ally for Œ a school for non-commissioned 
officers. But since I had the six weeks, they
 had to do somethin
g with me, so they 
sent me there. And I was in Œ I had an 
accident, training accid
ent and Œ and very 
serious foot Œ fracture of my  foot. What
 happened was the the trails of the 105 
Howitzers 
Œ this was an artillery base, and we were ar Œ taking artillery training. 
And I had an accident with a 105 
Howitzer
, which almost cut 
off my foot. But 
fortunately it didn™t, but it was a serious fract
ure, and I was sent to the hospital. And 
that was in May of 1952, an
d was in the hospital throu
gh the following January. So 
by th at time, I no longer had enough time to be sent to 
Korea
. You had to have a ba 
Œ at least a year of remaining service to be
 sent overseas. So I 
didn™t have that time 
any mo re. And so I was kept at the hosp
ital as a clerk. They  had to assign me 
somewhere. And spent the re
st of my time as a cler
k in the hospital and was 
discharged  in November of 1953. 

Q: What happened to  your relationshi
p with your parents during th is Œ 

 
Interview with Kurt Pauly 
 
 
Novemb er 18
, 
1997 
 
 
 
38
A: Well my  parents, you know, once they r
ealized that the accident was not that Œ 
well, it was serious, but it certainly wasn™t
 fatal, and fortunately the surgery was 
very successful on my  foot. And although 
I was in the hospital a good deal of the 
time, my  parents, in effect, had the s Œ had 
Œ felt a sense of relief that I wasn™t going 
to be sent to 
Korea
. And in  fact, I went home a good deal of time because of my  
injury. After the surgery and a brief rehab
ilitation in the hospital, they sent me on a 
30 day leave to home, just waiting for this 
thing to heal. I came back, they changed 
the cast and took out the pins from my foot
, sent me on another 30 day leave. I was 
home on three 30 day leaves and one 14 day leave before I got out of the hospital. 

So I had to Œ and then , of course, 
I spent the rest of my time in 
Arkansas
 as a clerk 
in the hospital. Then 
when I got out of Œ ou
t of the hospital, of course I had the ben 
Œ or Œ or out of the service, I got the benefits of the 
G.I.
 Bill. And as a disabled 
veteran, in quotes disabled, because 
of the injury Œ and I was somewhat 
handicapped, at least initially, because of th
at I had pains in my foot and Œ but not 
that serious. But they Œ but I did get the 
Œ a minimum disability 
as a result, from the 
Œ from the sw Œ when I was di
scharged from the service. As
 a disabled veteran, the 
benefits of the 
G.I. 
Bill were quite considerable. They
 Œ what Œ what Œ it was called 
was rehabilitation. In other word s, they 
were going to  rehabilitate you so  that you 
could do something. So  I Œ they  paid 
for four years at the University of

Pennsylvania
, all my tuition; I went to the 
Wharton
 School, and Uncle 
Sa m
 paid 
for everything. Cause my  parents certainly c
ouldn™t have afforded to pay, not unless 
I had gotten a scholarship or something. I ce
rtainly couldn™t have paid for that kind 
of tuition. So fortunate Œ I was very Œ in 
a way, this injury was very fortunate. So 
then I Œ I had four years at the University of 
Pennsylvania
, which I also enjoyed 
very mu ch . That was a great time. Cause I was getting paid to go to school. No t 
only did they pay for all the tuition and 
books and fees, but I got a subsistence 
allowance for living, whic
h I could do very  well 
[indecipherable]
. And in 1950 Œ 
late ™56, I met 
Jill
. 
Q: Now, were you at the 
Wharton
 School? 
A: Yes. I was sti ll in sc hool when I met 
Jill
. We were introduced by a mutual 
friend. At first we Œ the first time he tried 
to get us togeth er, of course, neither one 
of us could manage to get togeth er. But he
 wouldn™t give up, an
d a year and a half 
later, he tried again, and this time we met.
 A nd well, eventually I decided to Œ we 
decided to  get married and we did get marri
ed just shortly befo re I graduated from 

school. Unfortunately, my father at that
 time got sick, in the summer of 1957. And 
we married in the Œ December of 1957, so
 my father was dead by the time we 
married, unfortunately. But he did know 
Jill
, and he did know we were intending to  
get married. And I graduated in  1958. 
Now th at was difficu lt for my mother, 

 
Interview with Kurt Pauly 
 
 
Novemb er 18

40
because now she was widowed and sh e felt very
 un Œ well, she just 
felt kind of lost, 
and she Œ she felt she couldn™t live alone, 
so we had some difficulty along those 
lines, and at first Œ which was, I think, a 
big mistake, an lis Œ at least initially on our 
part, of course, she liv ed with 
us briefly, after we moved to 
New York
. I moved to 
New York
 for Œ because I got a job there with one of the large Œ big eight 
accounting firms. Was called 
Touche
, 
Niven
, 
Bailey
 and 
Smart
, now it™s part of 
Deloitte Touche
. So Œ but eventually
 my  mo th er Œ  we 
[indecipherable]
 to put her 
into an ap artment of her own, and we were
 nearby. In fact, it was in the same house 
where we lived, initially. 
Q: And were you 
supporting her? 
A: No, she was able to support herself. Sh
e had, between So cial Security and her Œ 
what Œ what money she Œ she had, she was ab
le to support herself so we didn™t have 
to support her. And Œ 
Q: But did you have to c
ontinue to give her a lot of emotional support? 
A: Yes, yes. A great deal of emotional s
upport. And I must say, my  wife was Œ was 
very good with that
, although it was very difficult for us, 
Jill
 really handled  it very 
well.  

Q: Now, your wife Œ 
A: She did a great d
eal for my mother. 

 
Interview with Kurt Pauly

Q: Œ your wife is a su rvivor. 
A: My wife is also a su
rvivor. Her family left 
Germany
 in 1939, very late, but was 
able to leave, and move to Œ go to 
Kenya
, 
East Africa
. That™s a long story on Œ of 
its own, but they were very
 fortunate because the Œ her Œ her immediate family and 
uncles, aunts and cousins, quite a few of th
em Œ and in fact, even two gran dparents, 
her father™s parents, and her mothe
r™s mother, also left w ith them. 
Q: Do you think your attracti
on for each other had something to  do with both of you 
being survivors? 

A: I think so , I think so, although we didn™t
 think of ourselves as survivors at that 

time. That term wasn™t rea
lly something that we applie
d to ourselves. I think so, 
because we had very comm
on similar backgrounds. It
™s Œ as it turned out, 
Jill
 came 
from a place that was very close to where 
I was born, although my Œ our parents 
didn™t know each other in 
Germany
. 
Q: But you had that in common. 
A: We did, we did. But now, her family
 was Orthodox, and over time I guess I sort 
of swung in that direction, as a result. 
Q: Mm-hm. You mean, over time after you were married? 
A: After we were married, yes, after we were married. 
Q: And so you consider 
yourself Orthodox now? 

 
Interview with Kurt Pauly 
 
 
Novemb er 18

42
A: Yes, yes, I do. But we were able to 
Œ to handle my  mo ther™s problems, although 
that wasn™t easy at first, but gradually
 she adjusted more 
to that. But my Œ 
Jill
 gave 
her a lot of support and I gave her suppor t, although I Œ I was working rather hard 
and 
Jill
, after we had children, didn™t work, so
 she had some time.
 And then living, 
at least initially in the sa
me apartment house as we, my
 Œ so we were very Œ you 
know, had Œ were able to Œ to give 
my  mo th er a g r eat 
deal of support.  
Q: And when were 
your children born? 

A: Our ch ildren Œ my  son is 32, and my  da
ughter is 30. They were adopted. My 
wife had several miscarriages, and we we
re never Œ we never had children of our 
own. So  we decided after the third misca
rriage, to adopt children, which we did. 
Q: And what was that experience like for you? 
A: Well, that was a really very Œ it™s emo
tionally a difficult experience, but we Œ we 
decided th at we wanted  to do that. And we adopted th em through th e 
Louise Wise
 
Agen cy in  
New York
. And that was quite an experien
ce in itself, going through that 
procedure. But I mu st say they Œ they we
re supportive because they saw we were 
sincere and they felt that we would make
 good parents. And we adopted  our son 
then wh en  he was Œ well, he
 was about three months old. And so then  short Œ then 
three years later we decided maybe we sh
ould try for another adoption, wh ich was 
very unusual. The agen cy di
d not give out a lot of seco
nd children. They  had just 

 
Interview with Kurt Pauly 
 
 
Novemb er 18
, 
1997 
 
 
 
43
started a program Œ in fact, initially, when 
we adopted our son, 
they gave out no 
second ch ildren. 
Q: Was that because they di
dn™t have enough children? 
A: Yes, yes. 
Q: Okay .  

A: And then  they, so mewhere during that 
time period, apparently, they started a 
program for giving out second ch ildren. Th
ey felt that perhaps 
it mi ght be good for 
the children, that they woul
d have siblings, or go to a family, not be an only ch ild. 
So they  started a program to place second ch ild
ren, and we were able to get into that 
program. And th en we adopted my daught
er about three years after my son. And 
she again was about three months old when  we adopted her. 

Q: And were they Jewish babies? 

A: Yes. In 
New York 
at that time, the law was that
 you Œ they Œ the children could 
only be placed in homes of the religion of
 their mother. So th
e agency could only 
place Jewish children, and it could only place
 them in Jewish homes. Except that 
there was one exce Œ an interesting ex
ception. There was a program for Native 
Americans adoption. You c Œ the law did no
t apply to Native Am
ericans. And they 
also had a program for placing Native Amer
ican children. It was a rather small 

 
Interview with Kurt Pauly 
 
 
Novemb er 18
, 
1997 
 
 
 
44
program. We never got Œ did adopt a Nativ
e American child. But that was the only 
exception at that time. 
Q: Would that have been your 
ch oice, to adopt Jewish babies? 
A: Not necessarily, because we
 Œ they could have become 
Jewish. So that Œ it just 
work ed out that way because when  we went 
Œ the agen ts Œ had we not been able to 
adopt through the agency, we
 probably would have tried some other means, but it 
all worked  out very well. So Œ and Œ so th
en  after we adopted my  daughter Œ well, 
first of all, the agency required that yo
u have a separate room for each of the 
children, that was one of the conditi
ons. We only had a thr Œ two bedroom 
apartment, and my son was already in the 
second bedroom. So we Œ we told the 
agency  we would get a sec Œ a third Œ 
another bedroom for the Œ fo r Œ for my  

daughter eventually, so we 
looked for a house. So on 
Œ on the condition that we 
would, you know, provide a second bedroom 
for the Œ my daughte
r, they placed my 
daughter with us on Œ she was 
still in the Œ we were still 
in the apartment. But what 
we did was we made a room out of a di
nette area, temporarily
, for my daughter. 
And somewhere after that we Œ we did m
ove into a house, and then  we had a 
bedroom for each child. And meanwhile I was working, and I worked for five years 
for a public accountin g firm, 
Touche
, and Œ whose name changed several times 
while I was working for them. But by th
 Œ when I left they were called 
To uche

Ross
. And after about five years 
I went with a comp any called 
Mark Marietta
(ph) 
in 
New York
, at the headquarters. It was shor
tly after th e company was formed, it 
was a merger of two other comp anies, th
at™s Œ is frequently the case. And I was 
with them until I retired 
really, in 19 Œ at th
e age of 62, in 1992. 
Q: Now, how did you get to 
Wash ington
? 
A: Ah yes, how did we get to 
Wash ington
, all right.
 
In the meantime, was oh, in 
the early 70s, my  mo ther began to  develop 
signs of dementia. So
 we Œ in the Œ in 
the meantime, she had moved out of her Œ th
e apartment in the house that we lived 
in, and taken an apartment in a Œ in Œ in
 Œ in a building that was built for senior 
citizen resident, as a senior citizen residence. She was very happy there. It was not 
too far from us. But while she was there sh
e began to develop 
signs of dementia. 
And at the suggestion of her doctors and 
based on our own obser
vations we decided 
that she probably  should go into  a Œ some 
kind of a home. And after looking around 
very long and hard, we found a place in upstate 
New York
, in 
New Roch elle
. There 
was a very good Jewish philanthropic home
 there, which is 
still there. And we 
decided of all the places we saw, this was the most approp Œ the best and most 
appropriate, and they accepted my mother. 
And this was in 1974, and two Œ oh, 
maybe two weeks after they had accepted 
my  mo ther, the comp any said oh, by the 
way, we™re moving the headquarters to 
Bethesda
, 
Ma ry la nd
. Now we knew that 

 
Interview with Kurt Pauly

46
they were consid ering moving, but it Œ but 
the actual knowledge that the move was 
going to take place occurred just as my moth
er had been accepted in this home. So 
we said, well, can™t put my mother there, 
we™ll have to try to place her down here. 
We decided to move down  here, that was 
[indecipherable]
 company 
[indecipherable]
. As it turned out, we couldn™t 
place my  mother in a home here. 
We tried some alternatives for her, but it di
d not work  out and we
 went back  to the 
home in 
New Rochelle
 and said, would th ey accept 
my mother? We couldn™t place 
her in the Hebrew home 
here. They had Œ they wo
uldn™t accept her, they didn™t 
have the facilities, she was an out-of-stater, 
so forth and so on. 
And they said well, 
if she™s in no worse condition that she wa
s when we accepted her, we™ll take her. 
And of course, she was in wo
rse condition. Except we we
re fortunate, the one day 
we took her up there she had a very  good da
y. I fl Œ we flew Œ I flew up with her, 
and she had a great day, and they  said fi
ne, she™s no wo rse than
 she was then, and 
they took her in. And althou
gh we felt very unhappy about placing my  mo ther in 
New Rochelle
, when we were here with our fam
ily, there was Œ there seemed to be 
no alternative. We decided to do th at and sh
e lived there for abou
t four years before 
she died. And we went up there roughly al
most once a month. On e of us would go, 
either I would go or 
Jill
 would go, on a Œ usually on a Su nday  to see my  mo ther. 
And of co urse, her condition deteriorated, so
 after awhile she really didn™t even 

 
Interview with Kurt Pauly 
 
 
Novemb er 18
,

47
know us any more, which is typical for that
 condition. But Œ so 
we took someone to 
help, we hired someone to help, you know, 
take Œ supplement the care that she was 
getting in  the home. And th at work ed out 
reasonably well in terms of her condition. 
And then, of course, eventually she died
, after about four years in the home. 
Q: That was when? 

A: Well, let™s see, that was Œ we 
moved here in ™74, it was about ™70 
[indecipherable]
 ™77. Meanwhile, of course, we we re here with our children, and I 
was continuing my  wo rk 
with the company. And 
Jill
, w h en  th e ch ild ren  g r ew  up  
decided sh e wanted to  do so mething ag ain, 
and sh e went, started selling real estate. 
We had Œ th e children grew up, that was 
a mixed bag. They had very bad teenag e 
years, and my  daughter was the most diffi
cult child. She had a te
rrible teenage time. 
I won™t go into all the details, but she ran 
away from home severa
l times. We finally 
had to Œ finally her condition go
t to be so bad, we hospita
lized her briefly. And that 
helped her a great deal. That
 really helped her. She was 
hospitalized almost a year. 
Q: That was a tough time for you. 
A: It was a very tough time for us. And me
anwhile my son, although he was not as 
rebellious as my daughter, or as difficult as
 my daughter, was also having a rather 
difficult teenage time. But my daughter 
somehow managed, as a result of the 
hospitalization, to pull herself together 
and her condition impr
oved. And although it

was far from perfect, nevertheless now sh e 
is married, and sh e has a s Œ husband, 
and she has two lovely child
ren, and Œ and although sh e 
never made it to college, 
she did graduate high scho
ol, and they™re living in 
Florida
. And my  son did get 
through Œ finally did go thro ugh 
the Un iversity of penns Œ of 
Ma ry la nd
. And he™s 
turned out to be a very ni
ce, responsible individual, an
d we™re very close to both 
children. And my  son lives in 
New York
 with his family, he also has two children. 
And we Œ in fact, his little boy 
was just born tw o weeks ago. 
Q: So you™re a grandfather again. 
A: A grandfather four times 
now. And so he has a little girl
, as not Œ just under two, 
and a little boy. And my daughter also ha
s a little girl an d a little boy we™re very  
close to. And th ey™re lovely  children.
 So we enjoy being grandparents.

Q: This is a continuation of a

Margaret Garrett
 
on November 18, 1997, in 
Silver Spring
, 
Ma ry la nd
. Tape numb er two, side 
A
. Mr.
 
Pauly
, could you talk about your beginning to volunteer at the mu seum? 
A: Yes. I retired in 1992, and at that time 
Jill
 was still selling real estate, but we 
decided to  look for something to do. An
d we had heard about the training program 
for the Holocaust Museum. So
 we applied, thinking th at with our background, it 
was something we would be very  interested
 in. And as that tu
rned out to be the 
case. We went and Œ 
Q: You say, with your background, 
did you have some feelings about Œ 
A: Yes, yes. 

Q: Œ being there? 
A: Yes, we did, because of all the people 
that both of us had lost in th e Ho locaust. 
And over the years, you know, you Œ you
 Œ as you get older, 
then you Œ you™re 
interested in what happened
 in the past. And so we had Œ we had to s Œ oh, we™d  
become more informed
 about what had happ
ened to our 
families that Œ during the 
war. And so we felt that this was somethi
ng we really wanted 
to do because of our 

 
Interview with Kurt Pauly 
 
 
Novemb er 18

50
experiences in the Œ and what had happen
ed to our families
. We felt that the 
mu seum was a good memo rial
, and Œ and a Œ and Œ and 
a Œ very  important as a 
place of learning, and we still feel that wa
y. And people can Œ 
should learn about 
the Holocaust. So when we Œ after our in
terviews, and when we started the training 
program, we felt we, you know, we really 
had done the right th
ing and we would Œ 
we would Œ we would want to
 do the kind of work  that
 the mu seum could provide 
us. 
Q: What contributed  to your bein g mo re su
re that that was what you wanted to  do? 
A: Well, as we saw what the museum wa
s, and how it was going about its mi ssion 
as a Œ a place of learning, and a place where people could come to see what had 

occurred, particularly people wh o might not 
otherwise have been able to have that 
experience. We felt that that was a very fittin
g kind of activity for us, sort of a Œ sort 
of a memo rial of our own fo r the people that we had lo st in the Ho locaust. And I 
think we still feel that way about it. So we 
went Œ visitor services
 is Œ is the work 
that we ended up doing. And now 
Jill
 though, has left the Œ 
at least temporarily the 
visitor services to wo
rk for the Œ work for 
Ma rty  Go ldman

Q: And what do you do in your volunteer 
[indecipherable]
 
A: Well, in Œ as visitor services, w e do th
e usual thing. We are at the information 
desk at the elevators, we orient groups, 
and ju st generally trying to be helpfu l Œ 
Q: And so Œ 
A: Œ to the Œ to the vi
sitors that come in. 
Q: Do you do all of th
ose at various times? 
A: Yes, yes, yes, at various times we do that. 
Q: And how of
ten do you go? 
A: We go in, well, once a week, on Thursd
ay afternoons is our time. And I mu st 
say, our group had been very
 stab le. Almo st all of those Œ almo st all of those 
volunteers are people who started with us wh
en the mu seum opened, and have been 
coming on Thursday  afternoons
 since the mu seum opened. 
Q: And so you started when  the mu seum opened? 
A: Yes, yes. 
Q: So you were in th
e very first group. 
A: Yes, we were in the first group, with
 the first group. We were there for the 
dedication and we™ve been
 there ever since. 
Q: Do you participate in 
other museum activities? 

 
Interview with Kurt Pauly

52
A: Not too mu ch, because we have other 
things. But well, wh
en they have, you 
know, meetings and other things, some
times we go. We go so metimes to Œ 
occasionally some of the cla
sses, although we haven™t 
gone to too many of them, 
because they™re in th
e evening and Œ and we™re tired 
on Thursday afte
rnoons and Œ 
although occasionally we go in for some
thing special, that we™re particularly 
interested in. 
Q: So th e group of volunteers on thirdy Œ 
Thursday afternoon ha
s remained fairly 
stable. 

A: Very stable there, yes. 

Q: And you™ve gotten to know the others? 
A: Yes, yes, yes, we™re friendly with th
em, sort of on a Œ on a volunteer basis. We 
don™t really get together with them otherw
ise, socially, but Œ but we all feel very 
close to each other as volunteers. 
Q: And do you feel that the 
volunteers work pretty well togeth er, or that sometimes 
there are frictions and tensions and Œ 

A: No, we Œ we Œ we seem 
to be a very homogeneous 
or at least a very Œ not 
necessarily homogen eous group, but we seem
 to get along very  well together, and 
we haven™t had any great co 
Œ any conflicts with each other. We Œ we Œ we are all 

very happy together.

Q: 
[sneezes]
 Excuse me. 
A: Bless you. 
Q: Are any of the other peop
le in the group survivors? 
A: No. 

Q: So you had to stop 
and think about that Œ 
A: Yes, I™m Œ I™m close Œ there™s one
 wo man who co mes whose husband was a 
survivor, but she™s the only one that™s close.  
Q: And do you feel different 
from the others in that you 
are a survivor and they are 
not, or do they s
ee you differently? 
A: I don™t know if we see each other th
at wa Œ well, obviously we™ve had some 
different experiences, but because we were
 child survivors a
nd also because we 
were not really directly in the camps, we 
weren™t in the Œ in th
e Holocaust in that 
sense, we don™t quite have the same experi
ences that the people wh o went thro ugh 
the camps had. Those survivors,
 I think we feel very differ
ent than they do. So we Œ 
we probably don™t feel as different as th ese other volunteers, al
though we do feel 
somewhat different because of Œ of our expe
riences and the things that we Œ we saw 
happening to our families. 

Q: Do you feel that you have
 a greater emotional understanding of what it™s about? 

 
Interview with Kurt Pauly

54
A: I don™t know, but Œ I don™t know if we 
have or not, but I th Œ we f Œ we Œ we 
certainly have a lot of feelings about th
e museum. Initially, when we were f Œ the 
volunteer program had the Œ ha
d the volunteers spend time 
in the exhibition, in the 
permanent exhibition. And that was part 
of your daily tour, y
ou would spend your 
time on Œ on the floor. And we began to co
mplain about that because we Œ it was 
emotionally too draining to  se
e that exhibit all the time. 
Q: We, you mean, we Œ 
A: The volunteers Œ 
Q: Œ the volunteer surv ivors? 

A: Œ and the Œ yes Œ no, all the volunteers Œ 
Q: All the volunteers. 
A: Œ began to feel that 
and we, ma ybe we felt it ev
en more, because of our 
experience, bu-but all of them began to feel 
that that was just too mu ch pressure and 
it was emotionally too upsettin
g to be in the exhibit th
at frequently, and for such 
long periods of time. As I put it, going thro
ugh the exhibit, after awhile the pictures 
that you saw, the images you saw began to 
be almo st like Œ like fami ly, they were Œ 
they became so familiar, it 
was almost like looking in to 
a family album, and it was 
just emotionally too wrenching to s Œ to do
 that all the time. Now, once in awhile 
we do go through the exhibit again, and 
we saw Œ us-u sually when we do, we find 

 
Interview with Kurt Pauly 
 
 
Novemb er 18
,

55
we see something we didn™t see before. 
But we can™t handle it on a da Œ on a 
weekly basis.  
Q: You say we go th rough Œ 
A: 
Jill
 and I. 
Q: You and 
Jill
 go through it. 
A: Yes. 

Q: And Œ and Œ 
A: Oh, some of the other volunteers also do. 
Q: And you do that just
 on your own initiative Œ 
A: Yes. 
Q: Œ to kind of refresh the experience? 
A: Yes sometimes. Or sometim
es we have friends who come in, and we™ll go with 
them, and sometimes we™ll 
accompany them through th
e exhibit. But on-only 
infrequently will we go th
rough. But we do want to
 go through periodically. 
Q: And could you say somethi
ng about the direct experience that you have with the 
visitors, what that feels like for you? 

A: Well, of course, in most cases it™s Œ 
th Œ it™s Œ it™s not ver Œ you do Œ you don™t 
have too mu ch reaction, but it c Œ but pe
riodically you find th at there are people 
who really have some kind of em-emo ti
onal experience they wa
nt to convey to 

 
Interview with Kurt Pauly 
 
 
Novemb er 18

56
someone, and th ey Œ they do th at, and 
th ey  co me u p  an d th
ey speak to the 
volunteers. 
Q: This is an emotional experience that they have in th e mu seum Œ 
A: In the museum. 
Q: Œ after Œ 

A: Afterwards, they come and Œ and Œ and 
they want to  speak to somebody about it. 
I guess they just feel they have to get it o
ff their che Œ out Œ off their chest, or they 
want to pass it along to someone in the mu se
um, that Œ that Œ this experience th at 
they™v e had. Just a few months ago I ha
d a very interesting experience. A woman 
came in who spoke Œ didn™t speak too mu ch
 English, she was German, a German 
teacher. And so she had come up to one of the other volunteers who knew that I 
spoke German, so she 
brought this woman over. So we
 spoke, and she said she was 
a teacher and sh e was here on some conferen ce and sh e wanted to see the Holocaust 

Museum. And afterwards, she came up to me
 and she s Œ was very emotional about 
what she had seen. And she said now, she sa
id, I™m really happy that I™ve seen this, 
because now no one in 
Germany
 can tell me that they di
dn™t know what was going 
on during the war. She said, a
nd I have to pass this along
 to my  grandchildren and 
my children. She said, I wa
nt them to know, make su
re that they know what 
happened. So occasiona
lly you get those kind of reactions. Or people who are just 

 
Interview with Kurt Pauly 
 
 
Novemb er 18
, 
1997 
 
 
 
57
very emotional about what th
ey™ve seen for some reaso n
. Either just because the 
whole exhibit is that way, or they ™ve had so
me experience in their lives that attaches 
them to the Holocaust
 in some way. Some family me
mber, or they themselves; we 
frequently  get other survivors who come in
 the mu seum and come up to  us and tell 
us a little bit about what they felt when
 they  went thro ugh th e exhibit.  
Q: So how has that affected your life th
e other six days of the week? Does that 
make your experiences mo re intense, or Œ 
A: I think we feel an attachment now to 
Œ to the mu seum, and to the Œ and to Œ to 
the people who come, because it seems to be
 an experience that™s Œ that™s important 
to them in many cases. And we™re very kin Œ 
we™re particularly also very interested 
in seeing all these children that come in
, these children™s groups, school groups. 
Now, some of them, of course, probably
 don™t get mu ch reaction. You know how 
children are sometimes, it™s ju
st another thing on their lis
t. But many of them seem 
to be very interested and 
do get something positive out
 of that experience. And 
that™s always something very 
worthwhile, when you see that. 
Q: So when you leave at the end of your
 duty every Thursday afternoon, how are 
you usually feeling? 
A: Very tired. Not only fi Œ not Œ not 
so much physically all the time, but 
emotionally sometimes draining. But Œ but 
we™re Œ we™re Œ but I feel good about it, 

 
Interview with Kurt Pauly

and 
Jill
 does too, although she decided to 
stop the visitors™ service work for a 
couple of reasons; one, it was getting to be 
physically to Œ diff Œ hard on her. Sh e 
felt that it was too tiring, and she wanted to
 try something else for awhile. Not that 
she was unhappy doing it, it was almost 
physical, more than
 anything else. You 
know Œ even though, you kn
ow, a lot of people say well, you™re always doing the 
same thing, and there™s no Œ 
but it isn™t always the same thing. It isn™t always the 
same thing. 
Q: So when people come up and want to
 talk to someone and you™re it, that Œ 
A: Yeah, it™s very satisfying. Or you can 
an swer questions for people. Lot of people 
come who have no experience 
or understanding of wh at ha
ppened in th
e Holocaust 
and after they™ve seen it, or even be Œ 
sometimes before they
 see it, they have 
questions, and th ey want to 
ask someone, or Œ or they  want to tell you so mething. 
And if you can help them deal with that
, or answer their questions, that™s very 
satisfying, cause that place is a 
place where people should learn. 
Q: Is there any mo re you want
 to say about that experien
ce before we move on to a 
new subject? 

A: Oh, I think that about covers it. I think 
that™s the Œ the satisfaction we get out of 
it is Œ is Œ is Œ is dual. One is satisfying 
to us because of what
 we™re doing, and it™s 

 
Interview with Kurt Pauly 
 
 
Novemb er 18
, 
1997 
 
 
 
59
also satisfy ing because we feel that that™s
 something we™ve done 
for the people that 
were lost in the Holocaust. 
Q: Have you made trips back to 
Germa ny
 or 
Israel
? 
A: Well, we made trip s to 
Israel
, yes. And of course, we went to 
Yad Va shem
 and 
that Œ lo-long before we
 had a mu seum here in 
Washington
. Now that™s a very 
different kind of institution. We found th
at to be emotionally very difficult to 
handle, 
Yad Vashem
, as well. But I f Œ I find that I n Œ in a way I find the museum 
here easier to handle than I did 
Yad Vashem
 for some reason. I™m not sure what it 
was, but Œ or maybe it was just because th
e time has passed and I™ve just adjusted 
better to handling my  emotions in relation to that. 
Q: Oh, th is was the first Holocaust mu seum you had 
[indecipherable]
 
A: Yes, yes, and that was many years Œ th
e first time we went was many Œ that was 
many years ago. And Œ and on our other trips to 
Israel
 we never Œ we never went 
back to the Œ to the Œ to 
Ya d Va shem
, because we found it emotionally so 
upsetting. 
Q: Do you think if it had not been so ups
etting, you might have considered going? 
A: Maybe, maybe. I don™t know. 
Q: How was it for you otherwise, visiting 
Israel
? 

 
Interview with Kurt Pauly

60
A: Oh, well we Œ we liked visiting is Œ we
 went several times with the Œ when the 
children were young and we™ve 
gone since. And of course
 my  ve Œ my  cousin is 
there, my Œ my mother™s nephew. And we™re
 close to Œ because Œ in a way, because 
we Œ we have so little family
. He also has very little fami
ly. All those cousins that 
we would have had, and other family memb
ers are all gone. And that™s kind of a tie 
that we have with him. 

Q: So that™s a very important part of Œ 
A: Yes, it is. 
Q: Œ going to 
Israel
 Œ 
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: Œ to see him. 
A: Yes. Although, as I said to you before, 
we visited him si Œ he™s with the foreign 
service, the Œ the Israeli foreign 
service, so we™ve seen him in 
Europe
 several 
times. And he™s been in je Œ both
 times he™s been stationed in 
Germany
, because he 
speaks German so well. And of course for 
him it™s a different experience, as Œ well, 
you know, to be there as a Œ as
 a Œ and in that capacity Œ 
Q: What was it like for you to visit 
Germany
? 
A: Well, the first time we went to 
Germany
 was in 1983. Was the first time w e, 
either one of us, had been back to  
Germany
. And we didn™t know what our reaction 

 
Interview with Kurt Pauly 
 
 
Novemb er 18
,

61
would be wh en we went. And we
 both Œ we went to both wh ere 
Jill
 had come from, 
and also to 
Aach en
 and 
Eilendorf
 where my mother™s fam
ily had come from. And 
it was a little difficult to handle, but Œ but 
Jill
 wanted to  go back as Œ and I wanted 
to go back, just to see 
where our Œ where we™d come
 from and wh ere our parents 
and family had been, and 
what that was like. And 
Jill
 had a lot of memo ries.
 Jill Œ 
Jill
 has a Œ many more memories, in a way,
 from her childhood th an I do. And of 
course she had heard a lot from her parent
s and gran dparents and aunts and uncles 
about life in 
Germany
, so she wanted to see where th
ey had lived . And I went with 
my cousin then to 
Eilendorf
, and Œ and also 
Jill 
went along. And we went to the 
home, on our own, the home wh ere my  Œ where his father and my  mo ther had 
grown up, where they  Œ and wh ere later my
 mother had lived, and my father. And 
when we got to the Œ it was a very intere
sting experience, we got to the door, we 
knocked and we introduced 
ourselves and to ld them who we were. And the woman 
who answered the door as Œ was the Œ 
was the wife of the man who now was 

running that butcher shop. An
d her father-in-law was still 
alive, and he had been the 
appren tice to my  gran dfather. And when  we 
came in she gave us Œ it was almo st as 
if she was r u nning a tape, she almost had to
 get it off her chest as Œ this whole story 
that she remembered of my grandfather. 
Q: Had you heard the story before? 

 
Interview with Kurt Pauly 
 
 
Novemb er 18
, 
1997 
 
 
 
62
A: No, we hadn™t heard that story before
, and it was Œ that was a very emotionally 
lil Œ emotional experience because this
 was such a sad story and Œ and 
Jill
 and I and 
my cousin, after we left we sort of said
, you know and Œ although we understood 
wha Œ but why couldn™t, you know, someone 
like that have perhaps taken him and 
hidden him? But you know, of
 course, that was very dangerous to do, and Œ and of 
course they had no obligation 
to do it. It was good eno
ugh of them, I guess, that 
they helped him with food, 
and so forth. But Œ but for us it was so terribly sad to 
hear that. First, you know, from someone wh
o had seen him, and 
Œ and so we went 
away. We were rather depressed when we 
left that Œ at that time. A lthough the 
people were very nice people. And we ha
d no Œ we really didn™t have any bad 
feelings about them. And my  parents Œ 
Q: But you did have the feeli
ngs of why couldn™t someone Œ 
A: Yes Œ 

Q: Œ have hidden him? 
A: Œ that™s right, exactly, we sort of ha
d those feelings. Because my mother, my Œ 
had always spoken well of those people.
 I me an, you know, she had had very 
positive feelings toward them. And Œ sort
 of the people that she knew in her 
childhood, and of course thought of Œ 
all of them obviously weren™t Nazis, 
necessarily. So we f Œ we Œ you know, we 
didn™t have any bad f
eelings about it. But 

 
Interview with Kurt Pauly 
 
 
Novemb er 18
, 
1997 
 
 
 
63
that was a terrible feeling to go away, 
and having heard that story from someone 
who had actually experienced it, and 
knowing wh at fate had befallen my  
grandfather. Then  we went back  again, this
 time in 1997 at the invitation of the city 
of 
Aachen
. And they  had arranged Œ they had a pr
 Œ they  have a pr Œ they have the 
prog Œ a program to bring back sa
 Œ people who has Œ had been  in 
Aachen
 and had 
been forced to flee, because of the Nazis. 

Q: Jews and were there others? 
A: No, were Jew Œ no, Jews. I don™t think 
there was anyone who wasn™t Jewish that 
had been brought back. And si
nce they had missed us on th e first program that they 
had Œ they  had a large group about three, f
our years earlier, this was a very Œ in a 
way it was very good that maybe they™d  
missed us because now th ere were only 
two of us there, and so  it was a very person
alized kind of thing, very personal. And 
they had arranged for us to meet this group
. I call them the Œ call them the historical 
society, but their actual name would Œ closer is the 
Heimatverein
, which sort of a Œ 
a home Œ a hometown club. Bu t basically they
™re a historical society, that™s what 
they™re interested in, they™re
 interested in the history of Œ of this part of 
Aach en
, 
Eilendorf
, that they Œ their family  Œ where th
ey live, and where their families h ave 
lived for generations as well.
 And when  we came they want
ed us to Œ to meet with 
them, and to tell us what they knew  about the Jews that had lived in 
Eilendorf
, and 

 
Interview with Kurt Pauly 
 
 
Novemb er 18

64
also to see what Œ what our experiences had 
been after we left. So they Œ so we not 
only got the usual tours, but we actually me
t with people, including my  former ne Œ 
nanny, and some other people wh o had lived
 there for Œ during
 the time when my 
parents were still there, although most of
 the people were much too young to have 
been anything but children, or even some
 of them were, of course, obviously  not 
even born til after the war. But they were ve
ry interested in wh
at had happened to 
these Œ their former Œ the former residents, 
the Jewish residents of this little to wn of 
Eilendorf
, which was now incorporated into 
Aach en
, cause the Œ so they had done 
all this genealogical research on my moth
er™s family. And one other interestin g 
aspect, by the way of that, I just mention in
 passing; my  mo ther had always said that 
she was rel ated to 
Annie Frank™s
 family, and we never quite knew how. So  we had 
mentioned this to them. And the facts Œ 
my mother told th
e story that when 
Annie 
Frank™s
 grandmother, maternal grandmother a
nd Œ I™m sorry, yes Œ of Œ paternal 
grandmother, was very ill. She was one of the people 
[indeciphera ble]
 sort of a 
distant member of the family, that came 
when Œ during her illn
ess, and she spent 
some time with her. But we never quite kn
ew what the relationship was, so we 
mentioned it to them and subs
equently they  deg Œ dug in
to the genealogy and they 
found out what the connection was, that 
Annie Frank
 and I had th e same great-
great-grandparents on her father™s side, wh
ich was, you know, her mo ther™s Œ well, 

 
Interview with Kurt Pauly 
 
 
Novemb er 18
, 
1997 
 
 
 
65
her mother™s side. I™m sorry, 
not her father™s side, her mo
ther™s side. So we had the 
same great-great-grandparents, that™s wh
ere the relationship came in. Which was 
very interesting to hear. And 
my  mo ther always said that I had played with her and 
her sister at some time, but I don
™t have any memories of that. 
Q: What was it like seeing your nanny again? 
A: That was a very Œ first of all, it wa
s a big surprise, because I didn™t even know 

she was still alive. Of course I Œ I didn™t
 know at that time what her age was, 
because, you know, when you™re six years 
old everybody Œ I th
ought she was much 
older than she obviously was. But it was Œ 
it Œ it was a so rt of bittersweet thing. 
Obviously, it was wonderful seeing her again,
 and hearing her stories. On the other 
hand, some of the things sh-she told us
, were very unhappy th ings, about, you 
know, what my  Œ wh at had began Œ so
rt of experiences my  parents had 
[pho ne 
ringing] 
after the Nazis came in 
and Œ and the time we were
 leaving, and what she 
knew about the family, what had happened to  
my  cousins and so fo rth. So  that was 
an unhappy part, but on the other hand, we
 were very happy to hear from some one 
who had known  the family and had rememb ered Œ of course, we also went to the 

cemetery where my great-great grandparen
ts, great grandparents, my grandmother 
all are buried. And my Œ and my  mo ther™s
 twin sister, who died  of a Œ of the 
influenza epidemics after the 
first World War. All these pe
ople are buried there, at 

 
Interview with Kurt Pauly 
 
 
Novemb er 18
, 
1997 
 
 
 
66
this little cemetery in 
Eilendorf
, and it™s still there, those stones are still standing. 
So that was a bit of a Œ a Œ that sort 
of gives you an  Œ at a time now, you know, 
you™ve heard these stories, but to actually 
see it, actually see where these people are 
buried, and to see that, give you a sort of
 a more immediate Œ mo re immediacy to Œ 
to all the things that you heard. It gives 
it a mo Œ a newer reality, so to speak. It was 
interesting, we also Œ we al
so spoke there to one
 of the school groups there, they 
had asked us to do Œ wh ether 
we would do that, speak to 
a group of children. That 
occurred both in th
e Œ in the Œ in 
Colo gne
 when my wife went back there last year, 
and this year when we were in 
Aachen
. Both times the Œ the 
people there asked us 
to speak to some school groups. So  we did,
 we spoke to  a group in  the school called 
the 
Pius
 gymnasium, named after Pope pa
 Œ one of the popes, Pope 
Pius
, one of the 
Pius™s
, I guess. And Œ 
Q: So th is was a Catholic school? 
A: It Œ yes, but it™s a public school in 
Germany
. 
Q: What does that mean? 

A: Well, it means that it is Œ in 
Germany
 th ey Œ these schools are also supported by 
the state. In  other words, they™re not privat
e schools in the sense that we have here. 
And Œ 

Q: So it™s supported fina
ncially by the state Œ

A: Partly, yes. 
Q: Œ but the Catholic Œ 

A: Yes, but it™s a Œ 
Q: Œ church runs the school? 
A: Yes, yes, it™s a Catholic Œ well, yes, th
e people there are Œ they Œ they te Œ yes, 
they Œ th ey have religious classes as well, 
as well as the usual school classes. S o  it™s 

Œ but we spoke to a group of children, two 
classes wa Œ and Œ the ages of 12 to 13. 
And they  had done a project on Jewish life in
 that area before the 
war. So they were 
somewhat familiar about the history of the 
Jews in that area, and they  had studied 

about the Œ they had sort of a course 
on comparative religion
, so they™d study 
something about the Jewish relig
ion as well. So they were in
terested to hear from us 
about our experiences. And we did it on a sort
 of a question and an swer basis, rather 
than just sort of lecture to the students
. We s Œ we did it on th e basis of answering 
their questions, wh ich wy Œ th-the Œ the ch
ildren got very much 
involved , we were 
really surprised at how invo
lved the children got
 in th is question and answer period. 
They really seemed to
 show considerable interest in
 what happened , and Œ but wa Œ 
what it meant to be Jewish and what Œ a littl
e bit about the Jewish religion, and what 
had happened to the Jews in 
Germ any
 during th e period of Œ 
of the Nazi regime.  
Q: So they were interested and curious. 
Did you notice any reac
tions to all this?

A: Yeah, there was one reaction from the 
sec o nd class. They
 got very much 
involved in Œ particularly the Œ well Œ we
ll Œ well, the girls particularly, for some 
reason, I think they™re more outgoing and are 
willing to Œ at that 
age I think they are 
a little more mature th an the boys. And af
ter the class w as over, they stayed, and 
they wanted to know 
about, you know, wher
e we lived and Œ and what it was like to 
be Jewish in the 
United States
, and th  Œ so th ey Œ I mean
, they carried on even after 
Œ after the period was over. So they were 
Œ th ey Œ they  had Œ they  showed quite a 
bit of interest. 
Q: So they showed 
interest, did they express any 
feelings or reactions to the 
information they were getting? 
A: Not directly. I mean, they 
didn™t evaluate it. It™s just
 that their re sponse was so 
positive, that we really  felt very good about it. 
Q: Positive as far as
 strong interest? 
A: Yeah, strong interest, and the kind of 
reaction they  had, and what they said. And 
we promised to send them Œ the teacher as
ked us in Œ also to send us Œ her some 

information, books and so fo
rth, about the Holocaust, sin
ce we were work ing at the 
mu seum. And we said we
 would, and we did. 
Q: In English? 

 
Interview with Kurt Pauly

A: In Œ well, unfortunately th
ey™re all in English. And we 
sent them, and we just got 
back Œ course, that t-to ok 
us a little bit of time after we got home to get it all 
together. And th en when you send a packag
e like that, it takes awhile to get over 
there. And we just got this
 weekend, we just got a letter from a man  who was the 
head of this 
Heimatverein
, this organization, that we™ve gotten somewhat close 
with him, he™s a younger man. He™s an
 engineer, he speaks English very well, 
comes to this country  frequently on busine
ss. And we™v e been running th is through 
him. In fact, the school that we went to
 was the school his children go to. So  we 
sent the books to him to pass along to the t
eacher, and he just Œ th
ey just got that the 
other week , and he sent us back a long le
tter saying how much 
they appreciated it, 
and that the teacher was beginning to get 
into these books, but 
could we send them 
something in  German, because they  found 
it more difficult to handle it in English. 
Now the children have Œ do study Englis
h, and these childre
n had one year of 
English already when we spoke to them. Bu
t obviously th at Œ they  Œ it™s easier for 

them to handle the German. But I don™t 
know whether we can get some of these 
things in German, or Œ but they  Œ they
 were very appreciative of getting this 
information. 

Q: And so what was that like for you to 
sp eak to the children and to get involved 
with the school?

A: Well, we were very happy to  pass along to them some  firsthand experience. In  
other words, we were Œ as they say, and th
ere™s a German phrase for it, which really 

says you™re a witness of the event. We were
 witnesses of the events that occurred. I 
mean, they™re young children, to them this
 history is almo st like reading history 
about Ancient 
Rome
 in a way. Bu t Œ but here were people who actually had the exp 
Œ lived in  that time f Œ period, and had ex
perienced some of these things, and th ey 
found it very interesting, and 
they seemed to take to it 
very readily, and they were 
very interested in our expe
riences. They wanted to he
ar what had hap Œ wh at we 
had Œ you know, wh at had happened to us
, and why it happened to  us. Of course, 
we couldn™t really tell them
 why in Œ in one sense, but on the other hand, it ma de 
what they had learned in cla
ss that much more immediate 
and real for them, as w ell. 
And we felt very good about being able to 
pass this along to this chi Œ generation, 

because those are the people we have to 
Œ hope to Œ to get to understand what 
occurred.

A: Yes, you were asking ab out our Œ wh
at our feelings we
re about going to 
Germany
, and they  are very mu ch  a mixed Œ a mixed emotional bag. On one side, 
of course, it™s very sad a
nd not happy to go to a plac
e where those thing that we 
know happened, and some of them which we experienced ourselves happened, that 
Œ so that™s the sad side of it. On the other hand, it was good to  see where our 

families liv ed, and also  to meet people 
who showed some sincere interest and 

understanding of wh at occurred, and really
 wanted to know what happened, and 
what our feelings were. No
w obviously  the people we me
t in these circumstan ces, 
are people who have Œ well we Œ shall we
 say a positive attitude toward what 
occurred in the Holocaust. I m
ean Œ so in the Œ in the se
nse that they know what 
happened, and feel that they 
want to try to make good in
 some sense, to the limited 
extent that they can, the terrible Œ make
 goods Œ you know, the Œ it™s Œ from the 
terrible things that occurred. So it™s very 
good to meet t hose kind of people now. 
Obviously we know that th
ere™s still anti-Semitism in 
Germany
, and that there are 
still people running around in 
Germany
 who were perhap s di
rectly involved in 
some of the atrocities that 
occurred in the Holocaust. 
So, you know, and so that 
gives you kind of a terrible feeling when  
you™re just walking down  the street and 
you see someone of an age that you know
 went through the period as an adult; 
period of the Holocaust, period from 
™33 through ™45; and you wo nder, you know, 

 
Interview with Kurt Pauly 
 
 
Novemb er 18
, 
1997 
 
 
 
72
you have this Œ this Œ this nagging fee
ling about, you know, who are these people? 
You know, were they perpetra
tor, were they di Œ were th
ey directly involved? And 
that™s a very, very difficult 
emotion to  deal with. Bu t on
 the other hand, I guess it™s 
Œ in a way it™s a good thing to face up to th
at, and to know that 
both of these sides 
of 
Germany
 still exist, and the hope
 we have is for this
 youngergener Œ these 
younger generation to really 
understand and that Œ wh at 
happened , and therefor try 
to make sure it doesn™t happen again. 
Q: How do you think 
your experience has affected yo
ur current or past political 
views, or your opini
ons about national and 
international issues? 
A: Well, I think it pr Œ the fact that it 
happened, and happened to our families, 

happened  to  us, that pe Œ you know, th at here are people who have lived in a 
country for hundreds of ye
ars, as my family and 
Jill™s
 family had done, and really 
felt German, no question about 
it. I mean, my father was a 
soldier in the first World 
War. And the Jews of 
Germany
 were as patriotic Germans as the Jews of 
America
 
are patriotic Americans. I mean, they felt 
German. And to think that what happened 
could happen, and did happen
, is in a way very disturbing to us individually, 
because 
[phone ringin g] 
somehow you have that na
gging feeling that maybe it 
could happen again, and maybe even coul
d happen here. I mean, I think surv ivors 
had mo re of that feeling than pe
ople who did not 
go th rough that. 

 
Interview with Kurt Pauly 
 
 
Novemb er 18
, 
1997 
 
 
 
73
Q: And you had that feeling mo
re than people who did not Œ 
A: I think so . I think, based on my Œ ou
r experiences with people who were not 
survivors of the Holocaust, who were not in 
Europe
, who were Americans, and 
have lived  here, didn™t have that experience
 directly, I think we 
feel differently than 
they do. And I get th Œ I get the same 
reaction from other friends of ours who are 
also survivors, that they have those fee
lings and those emotions. I just Œ you ju Œ 
they Œ I mean, I guess you can never quite 
feel as certain about what™s going to 
happen, and that it™ll be that Œ or that so mething like that occu
rred in the Holocaust 
can™t happen again, or can™t 
happen  to Jews again, or can™t happen in this country 
again, as people who didn™t have that experi
ence. I think that also makes the state of 
Israel
 for us, much more important in that se
nse. That that is something that was 
not there when the Ho
lo caust occurred, and had it been there, probab ly things 
would have been somewhat different, becaus
e at least Jews woul
d have had a place 
to go. 
Q: How does this feeling affect your 
politics or your participation in the 
community? 

A: Oh, I think Œ I don™t know. But I thi Œ 
I don™t know whether it has some of that 
direct effect Œ maybe I™m Œ I™m 
[indeciphera ble]
 our politics mig h t be otherwise, 
but it definitely, I think, has an effect 
on how we interpret th
e events, and what 

 
Interview with Kurt Pauly 
 
 
Novemb er 18
, 
1997 
 
 
 
74
people say and do. And wh en
 something occurs, maybe we
 feel Œ you know, if we 
see something Œ maybe we are mo re apt to 
interpret something as being anti-Jewish 
or anti-Semitic than others, because we said
, hey, wait a minute, is that really Œ you 
know? And it may not be, but I think you 
have that reaction mo re quickly than  
people wh o have not gone through something like that. 

Q: Does an example come to mind? 

A: Well, let me try to think. All right, when
 we had this Œ oh, what was this fellow 
down  in 
Louisia na
? Can™t think. He ran for the 
U.S.
 Senate from 
Louisiana 
Œ 
Q: 
Huey  Long
? 
A: No, no, no, no, no, mu ch later, 
recently. A few years ago. No, not 
Huey Long
, 
much earlier Œ much later than
 that. I can™t think of his 
name. He was a really Œ I 
mean, he really was someone who not so mu
ch Œ not necessarily 
anti-Semitic direct, 
but he was just sort of anti a lot of thi
ngs, and he had Œ obviously  was a person with 
a great deal of Œ of Œ of prejudices, in
 terms of minorities a
nd other people who 
were not, you know, quite An
glo-Saxon Americans. And when  you Œ you know, so 
I think our reaction to that was much mo re
 fearful in a way, than other Americans 
who said, oh well, you know, 
he™s out on a far limb, he™s
 far Œ you know, he™s way 
out of the political s Œ on the side of some
 extreme side of the political spectrum, 
because we said, well, peop
le like that who were on the far side of the political 

 
Interview with Kurt Pauly 
 
 
Novemb er 18
,

75
spectrum in 
Germany
, finally got into power, and we
 said, you know Œ so we™re 
much more Œ I think perhap
s we™re mu ch mo re concerned about those things than 
people wh o don™t have those experiences. 
And wh en we see it in other parts of the 
world also, we™re Œ we s Œ we Œ we perhaps 
in si Œ always more fearful that people 
who have such negative views, in terms of
 other minority groups, wh ether it™s here 
or in 
Europe
, or in 
Asia
, can get into a position where 
they can create the kind of 
regime that did the sort of thing that happened in 
Germany
. I do think that that™s 
something that impacts surv
ivors more than others.  
Q: And it impacts you mo re than others. 

A: Oh yes, yes, as Œ me as well, y es. 
But overall, I think we™re, you know, basically, 
because of our age when we left 
Germany
, I think we™re prow Œ we are, on the 
other hand, not as much affected as pe
ople who ev en went Œ or, you know, who Œ 
who went through th e camps, who went thro
ugh the actual events of the Œ that 
occurred in 
Europe
 in the Holocaust, I don™t think 
we are Œ we don™t Œ I don™t think 
we have quite their emotions, cause they 
mu st have a whole other set of emotions, 
and concerns and reactions. But I do th ink 
we are also Œ but we Œ I think we™re 

somehow different emotionally than peopl
e who haven™t had an
y Œ the experien ce 
even we™ve had. 

Q: So it™s had a major, lasting impact on Œ 

 
Interview with Kurt Pauly 
 
 
Novemb er 18
, 
1997 
 
 
 
76
A: Yes, and I think it had it Œ and the other thing is, I think it had a Œ a terrible 
impact on our families, our parents. I th
 Œ don™t kn Œ you know
, there™ve been Œ 
there™s been a lot written about people who were in 
Europe
 and Œ and surviv ed th e 
Holocaust in 
Europe
, or Œ and wh at happened to 
them, people who were in the 
camps, or hidden, or so forth. I don™t th
ink there™s been much written about people 
who got out of 
Euro pe
, but had the experiences that our parents had, and wh at Œ 
what that meant for them, because here
 were people who were just, you know, 
ripped out of their environment, and ripped ou
t of everything that they were used to, 
and were thrown  into  another wo rld, ot
her countries, and had to ad just, you know, 
to Œ try to establish a whole new life 
for themselves. Now, obviously their 
experiences were not as horrible as the pe
ople who were involved in the camps, but 
they certainly, I know, are Œ both of our families suffered a 
great deal as a result of 
that as well. It™s a different kind of suffe
ring and it™s a different kind of experience. 

Q: But it™s suffering. 
A: But it™s there, nevertheless, yeah. So, 
I Œ I know our children an d our nieces and 
nephews and all the people of th e next 
generation, they  have again different 
experience and different fee
ling because they™re again another step removed from 
the events in 
Europe
. But I think even those people 
are somewhat impacted by our 
experiences, because they™ve heard it. 

 
Interview with Kurt Pauly

Q: Mm-hm. So it™s a part of their world. 
A: Yeah. Now, their children, again, 
now they ™re gonna be another Œ further 
removed from it, and now it really beco mes 
ancient history, in a way. And th at™s 
why I think the mu seum is very important, 
because it brings that history to these 

people, to these young people, and to th
e people who had no 
experience with the 
Holo caust, and says oh hey, wait a minute, 
here it is, and it™s Œ it™s more immediate 
than just reading about it, or hearing ab ou
t it, sort of on th e background noise, and 
hopefully it brings it up as a mo re Œ as a Œ 
as a more real experi
ence, that it really 
did happen, and it happened fairly recently, 
and it happened to people that are still 
alive today. That was an interesting expe
rience once I had in the museum when I 
was at the elevators. A young group came
 Œ some young people came through, oh, 
young teenagers, maybe again, 12, 13. And 
one of the boys came up to  me while we 
were waiting Œ while they were
 waiting for the elevator, and 
he says, is th Œ is there 
anybody still alive who Œ who experienced th
is? So to him this was already, you 
know, really, you know, ancien
t history. So  what I told 
him I had Œ had an ex per Œ 
you know, that I had lived through that, 
I guess it was sort of like, you know, 
meeting 
Julius Caesar 
or something, I don™t know. 
But Œ so that Œ our whole 
experience wa Œ you know. Now, we don™t 
want to make the Holo caust, you know, 
sort of a religion of life now because I thi
nk that™s a ne Œ that™s very negative. But I 

 
Interview with Kurt Pauly

think we have to rememb er what happen
ed , and Œ and live our life knowing those 
events occurred, and what those mean. 
Q: Is there anything else you can think to say? 
A: No, I think th at™s Œ I think th at™s about it. 
Q: Well Œ 

A: I se Œ I appreciate being able to Œ 
to Œ to  Œ you know
