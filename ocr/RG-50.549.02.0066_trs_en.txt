Question: United States Holocaust Memori
al Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection, 
this is an interview with Julian Noga,conducted by Regina Baier on December 14
th
, 2000 
in Mr. Noga™s home in Kent, New York. Th
is is a follow up interview to a USHMM 
videotaped interview 
conducted with Julia
n Noga on December 11
th
, 1990. The United 
States Holocaust Memorial Museum gratef
ully acknowledges Je
ff and Toby Herr for 
making this interview possible. This is tape 
number one, side A. I 
would like to ask you 
two questions, first of them 
is actually give us your fu
ll name, and when and where you 
were born. 
Answer: My  name is Julian Noga. I was born July 31
st
, 1921 in Poland. 
Q: And because there were several questions 
that I have after watching the videotaped 
interview, I thought several things were not 
discussed in detail enough, I would like to go 
back, actually, to the beginnin
g, even before you born a
nd ju st ask a few follow up 
questions. The first would be
, until -- before you were bo
rn, actually, until 1921, your 
family was in -- in this
 country, in the U.S.. Where did 
they live and what did your father 
do? 
A: Yes, my parents come to this country 
i -- before first World War. And they were 
married o -- here in this country , North Ad am
s, Massachusetts. And 
they had three sons, 
and in 1921, after the first 
World War, my  mother decided to go Poland. I don™t know

whether she go for a visit, or she go fo r stea
dy -- to stay in Poland. And at that time, 
1921, she was pregnant with me. Soon sh e arri
ved to Poland, two months after that, I was 
born in Poland. So  otherwise, my
 three brothers was born here, 
and my father stay in this 
country, just my  mo ther and my  three brothers, and she was pregnant with me, she come t 
-- t -- to Poland. 
Q: But you never quite knew w
hy that happened, why was your
 father still here? Was the 
idea to go back 
eventually, or -- 
A: I think that was little bit di
fferences in their marriage. 
Q: Okay, let™s le -- we can le -- we can l
eave it at that. Now, wh
en you were back, or 
when your mother was back in
 Poland, did you ha
ve a little bit of land there? Where did 
you go to  and how did she make a livi
ng, how did she care for the family? 
A: Yes, my mother had a few acres land, 
and I was grow up there on th e country, by 

Tarnów, wa -- quite a ways from Tarnów, thei
r name is Byshutshin, and the village was 
[indecipherable] what is hard to pronounce, 
right, for you? Okay, an
d I go school there, 
and soon I finished the school, I my self
 go to the big city, Tarnów, and -- 
Q: Let™s go back -- let™s go back just a little 
bit to -- to the first 
village. How lo -- how 
many years of schooling did you -- did you
 get? For how many years did you go to 
school? 
A: Well, that was seven years. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066

Q: And what does the -- can you describe a 
little bit more about th
e situation in the 
village? Was there, for instan
ce, some kind of Jewish comm
unity? Did you have contact 
with Jewish neighbors? 
A: Oh yes, we go out with the Jewish peopl
e, we had some people, Jewish people in our 
village, and also there was a -- a little city by 
the name Struchin, and 
that was, I should 
say, 50 percent Jewish populatio
n, in that city, and we was 
very close with the Jewish 
people. 

Q: Now, when you went to Tarn ów
, that was a larger city, right? 
A: Oh yes, yes. 

Q: And you became a dishwash er in a -- 

A: I started as a di-dishwasher. See, you gotta
 start somehow, somewhere. And I started, 
but I didn™t stay too long ba -- in a elegant,
 Jewish restaurant, there was a club, 300 
memb ers they had, and had all rich Jewish 
people belo ng as me mb ers there. But I didn™t 

stay too long there, and my 
idea was to learn something, 
and I go to the bakery  and I 
become a bakery apprentice. 
Q: And you stayed there fo
r about two years and th en 
the German invaded Po land? 
A: Yes. 
Q: And the bakery was closed, 
and you had to go back to th
e village and to your mother, 
right? 

A: Exactly.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 
 
 
 

 
5
Q: You said in the -- in the 
videotaped interview that the 
Germans started pretty much 
right away  arresting and executing Jews. 
A: Yes. 

Q: You mention an incident there where Jewish
 people that you know were also rounded 
up and -- and -- and shot. Did you witness that yourself? 

A: No, I didn™t witn ess, but I was there clos
e, I was -- matter of fact, I was in that 
Struchin, that was Struchin. On a vide
otape they put a drawing, you know, 
[indecipherable] no, this is -- 
that was in Struchin, was just
 a two, three kilometer away, 
you know, little city. And that 
was a -- quite a -- quite a Jewish population, and those 
Jewish, we used to do busin ess, we used to
 buy from those Jewish people, they have 
busin esses, and we know those Jewish -- thos
e Jewish people, see? Like for instance, one 
cabinet maker, and o-other -- the other one 
was -- sa -- had a tobacco business. And 

another one was photog -- photographer. I 
remember his name, he was-- name was 
Plushnik. And th at was a day wh en  the German
s come to that town. There was a special 
outfit, German outfit, SS, and they  rounded 
up those Jewish people, just pull them out, 
you know, they would -- whoeve
r they can catch them. And I 
believe that was 20 sener -- 
seven, 27 Jewish people. They -- they bring th
em to the park there, not far away from that 
church , they  give them the shovels, picks -- pi
cks and shovels, they 
dig out the graves for 
themself, and they shot them. 
And that was awful scare and th
e Germans told 
u -- told us 
-- told the Polish people, 
you gonna be the next. And 
that was very scary. 
Q: But this particular incident
 you did not see it, just of 
-- you heard about it, right?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 
 
 
 

 
6
A: I di -- I didn™t see it
 on own -- in my  own ey es. 
Q: Did you see anything th at was dir
ected against the Polish population? 
A: Oh -- oh yes, oh yes, there was quite a 
few Polish people arrest
ed, same time. First 
they go a-after intellig entsia
, like teachers, you know. And th
ey was arrested, many fact 
from Tarnów. That was their firs
t transport to Auschwitz, to 
the concentration camp, first 
transport. That was strictly
 Polish people, professors, t
eachers, you know, all kind of 
intelligentsia, you know. That was -- I believ e
 that was 170 some 
the intelligentsia.  
Q: I just have to get the microphone a little b it further away, so -- 
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: -- yeah, that should
 do. Do you know wh en that was,
 roughly, with th
e first transport 
with Polish people? 
A: I believe this is right after they build ou
t that concentration camp, yeah, yeah. So the 
Jewish people who come to the concentrati
on camp Auschwitz come later, but the first 
prisoner was the Polish teachers and pr
ofessionals, you know, and priests.  
Q: Did you -- did you and 
your mother talk about the situati
on, what to do, or did you ju st 
kind of wait? 
A: We just wait, and gosh, you know, we we
re scared and you didn™t know what™s going 

to happen to you, see? Because we didn't 
know -- we didn™t know what the Germans 
going to do to us, see? That wa
s pretty rough, though.  
Q: And when the Polish army 
receded, drew ba -- withdrew 
while the Germans came in, 
there was -- weaponry was left? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 
 
 
 

 
7
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: And you happened  to -- to find a gun and y
ou decided to keep it, although at that time 
the German orders were pretty clear about
 what would happen. I mean, Polish citizens 
were supposed to deliver all th
e w eapons to the Germans, or there was a death sentence if 
they didn™t. 

A: Exactly. 

Q: My -- my  question would be, wh
y did you decide to keep it? 
A: Oh my  gosh, I was going th rough the wo
ods, and I see something on the side, you 
know, a -- a fresh leafs, you kn
ow, and th is some -- you know something is there. So I go 
there and I -- I -- I move the leafs you know, 
and I see beautiful, brand new rifle. So, I 
take it. I took it and I bring it home, and I put hi
m in a -- in a barn. I hide him in a -- in a 
hay. Bu t, same time, somebody saw me. And 
you know, people are people. People talk. 
And somebody make a denunciation on me to 
the chief of police, and he was a -- he was 
a German. Eventually, you know,
 they called me, and they to
ld me to bring the rifle. 
Q: So you kept it, di -- wh
y -- but actually why did you k
eep it? Because, I mean, you 
were young, you were a young -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- boy, a young man at that point. 
A: Foolish. 
Q: Did you -- but did you th ink it would 
be useful for you to [indecipherable] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 
 
 
 

 
8
A: I didn't think really about that, but just 
to ha-hav e an beautiful
 rifle, you know. Maybe 
go hunting. 
Q: Was -- was that sort of -- how did you feel about a Po lish -- a fellow Po lish person 

going to  the Germans, though, and denounci
ng you? I mean, was that something -- 
A: I don™t know how this happened, that I 
can answer these questions, see, because you 
know, you never know, you never know. But I 
know th at was how they find out, see? 
Somebody mu st say something. 

Q: So and th en you were brought to the Ge
stapo in  Linz, and yo
u were interrogated? 
A: No, first -- 

Q: Oh, no, no, no, I™m sorry, 
you were what -- but you were
 brought to the -- the --  
A: -- fir -- 
Q: -- the Gestapo 
A: -- first their chief, his name was Vanline.
 Many people know that
 n ame fro m my  area  
where I come from, y ou know. He was -- he 
was a tough guy. He speak fluently Polish. 
Matter of fact, before the war, he was a engine
er there, from the br
idge there -- they was 
build  up the bridge. He was a engineer, but 
at the same  time he was a spy, he was 
working for Germans. And then
, after the Germans come, he 
become the comm andant of 
that police station there. So he questioned 
me. Did you bring your rifle? Which -- and I 
says, no, I haven™t got no rifle. Yes, you have
. You know, and th is, and this, and th is and 
then they  beat me  pretty bad, you know. 
Yeah. Himself, you know
, gave me 25 on my  
rear end, and there was two other guys, you 
know, they beat me  t
oo. Then  I was lucky 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 
 
 
 

 
9
because the people from the v
illage come to him and they
 say I am innocent. I was 
work ing in a bakery and I ha
d a good record , you know, I wa
s clean. And he changed the 
mind, and he says, yeah, on one condition.
 We let you go, but Wednesd ay we gonna 
recruit in some young people
 for Germany to work. Now, 
why don™t you be there, and 
you go Germany, and you 
be -- going to be more safe in 
Germany than here. He told me 
so. So me and friend of mine and few others
, we go Wednesday there, we registered 
there, and they put us on a 
train and we go, who knows wh
ere we go, what™s going to  
happen. That was very hard fo
r me, that early  in the mornin
g, to say good-bye to my 
mother. 
Q: But then you did not go to Germany af
ter all, you were brought to Au stria -- 
A: Yes. 
Q: -- at this time to Linz. Did y
ou ever find out why th at happened ? 
A: Well, at that time th ey need
ed  young people on the farms, in
 the -- in the factories, and 
happen our transport, that wa
s -- they pick up so
me more in Tarnów
, in Kraków, they 
pick up more, more people, young people. And 
happened that -- that 
this transport go to 
Austria [indecipherable] Czechoslovakia, an
d -- at that time, and Vienna, and from 
Vienna, Linz [indecipherable] yeah, and from
 Linz we go to  the 
farms, say -- me, and 
friend of mine. 

Q: And so, at the unemployment office then, th
ere were farmers waiting for the help to 
come, and one of them waiting was your wife
-to-be, your future wife, Frieda, and you 

went to her parent™s farm. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 
 
 
 

 
10
A: This is a -- a really coincident, and a go
od coincident, I should sa
y. Go od and bad and 
good. Yes. So we was pick up
 by the young, blonde lady. Sh
e was that time what, 18 - 19 
years old. Because, actually, her father™s suppos
ed  to come. Her father was a big farmer 
there. But he catch cold, for so
me reason he couldn™t go, so he
 sent Frieda. Frieda was his 
favorite daughter, you know, he 
love her. And Frieda pick us
 up, me and friend of mine 
by th e name Frank. 

Q: And then  at that farm you 
had to wo rk very hard , but a
pparently  you had meals at the 
table with the family, the food was plentif
ul, the food was good. How did you feel 
though, towards the situation?
 I mean, it was forced labor after all. Did you feel 
resentment towards -- towards th
e -- the parents in any way? 
A: Oh, oh, I -- I can™t complain
, because number one, they trea
t us very, very
 good. They 
-- Greinegger, that™s th e name of the -- of that
 -- her father, Greinegger family, they treat 
us good. They feed us -- we
 eat by the same table with the whole family. Would you 
believe we had five meals every day? And we
 had meat every day. 
And wh en you figure 
th-that was a war time, people in the city 
was living on a -- on a -- what you call? On a 
cards, you know? Just so mu ch. We had plen
ty fo od. Bu t also we work , on a farm you 
know, that was a hard work, but we don™t mind. 

Q: And then  you grew -- because you also wo
rked with Frieda on
 the -- on the -- on the 
fields, and whatever had to be done there, 
you grew a little closer. You got to know each 
other just a little bit, I mean, under very di
fficult conditions. And th
en one day you said 
that you asked her whether yo
u could listen to the radio -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 
 
 
 

 
11
A: Yes. 
Q: -- on -- actually, it™ s not in your story, but I th
ink it is in -- it -- i t™ s definitely in your 
wife™s story, that you asked 
her whether you could listen to 
the radio because you didn™t 
know mu ch was happening in the world, and 
that was also very forbidden, wasn™t it? 

A: Her father had a special room that he ha
d a little office over there, and on the wall you 
can see all those rifles, you kn
ow, and that is because he wa
s a -- he had this hunting area 
there. For a hundred years there was the hun
ting license in that house. And there was a 
radio in that time, yeah. And when everybo
dy goes sleep, you know
, Frieda opened the 
door, you know, and let me listen to the radi
o. So 10 o™clock in th e evening th ere was a 
very interesting news in Poland -- in Polish from England. And th at was very interesting. 

And somebody hear this, somebody find out th
at -- I don™t know how th e Gestapo find 
out about that [indecipherable]. That was one reason. 

Q: Somebody mu st have seen you, right? 

A: Could be, yeah.  

Q: But that did not -- but -- 
but -- but you still could stay
 on the farm, or -- you -- you 
were not immediately brought to -- to the Gestapo? 

A: No, no, no, no. 

Q: But then after awhile you got a little too clos
e with Frieda for fath
er™s taste, because it 
was a dangerous situation, so 
he gave you an ultimatum ba
sically. He brought you into 
the room and he said that one
 of you would have to go. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 
 
 
 

 
12
A: Oh that -- that happened after -- now th
a -- we gotta go back little bit, see, like 
[indecipherable]. So, we was working altoge
ther. There was four daughters, you know, 
he -- Mr. Greinegger had four daughters and 
one son. And one of the daughter, by the 
name Frieda, that™s the same Fried a pick us
 up in the -- you know
, when we come from 
the transport. And happen that
 winter we was working in  th
e woods, because they had -- 
they had, I don™t know, about 
20 acres woods, so we got th
e woods for the -- for the use -
- for the house use, and they had for sale, 
okay. And it happened we work in  the -- we 
work in the woods, then we 
work on the farm. And it happen
ed we -- we come -- me and 
Frieda, we come closer and closer. We was 
very friendly to each other, see? She was a 
beautiful, beautiful blonde. And they say I 
was good lo oking too, I 
don™t know, I™m not 
sure about that. 
Q: You still are, I think. 
A: Thank you. So, it gets closer and closer 
til agains -- that was to
o much. So the father 
that time called Frieda and he had a speech 
with her. An d he says, ﬁYou come too close 
with Julian, and you know th is
 is against the law. You kno
w what™s going to  happen to 
you. You know wh at™s going to  happen to hi
m. And who knows wh at a g -- what™s going 
to happen to us. This is agai
nst the law to have anything to
 do with a foreigner.ﬂ And he 
was right. Yeah. So he was pretty tough, firs
t time as she can remember, and she slap her 
over the -- on her face, you know,
 slapped her, yeah. And she wa
s crying. Then after that 
he called me. And he had a speech to me, yeah. 
And he told me absolu
tely this is against 
the law. You -- you can -- you can™t have an
ything to  do with my  daughter anyway . So  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 
 
 
 

 
13
one of you gotta go. Wh ich one? 
And for some reason Frieda wa
nt to go. And she want to 
-- she want me to stay on the -- on the farm. 
He says, that™s up to you. You want to go, 
okay, and Julian stay on this fa
rm. And that™s what happened.  
Q: Wh-When -- when we talk about being clos
e, what -- what did that really mean? I 
mean, you did not speak Au strian
 -- German -- Austrian in -- 
very much, she 
didn™t speak 
Polish. What did you talk about? I mean, cl
oseness, what did -- wh at did that really 
mean? 
A: Oh, you™d be surp rised when  you -- wh
en you like somebody 
how fast you learn -- 
how fast you learn that la
nguage. And I -- I knew some word s from -- from the school, 
you know, and didn™t take me l
ong. Matter of fact, in a -- in a -- in a year I pick up ab out 

oh, I should say 70 percent German language. 
What is -- Austrian language is German 
language, just a different -- different dialect, 
you see. So we a -- we like each other, let™s 
put it this way.  

Q: Was it surprising to you though
, that Frieda decided to leave? 
A: Frieda, yeah. Sh e decided, yeah . And she 
went. And th at was -- that was unusual see, 
because there was a su ch a big farm, so ma
ny acres land and everything, you know, was 
plenty work, you know, 
but one of us gotta go. They wa
nt to split us. Doesn™t matter who 
goes, who stays. So happened sh e goes to an ot
her farm, q u ite a ways from that place. But 
we make a promise, you know, the first Sunda
y we™re going to  meet by th e church there 
in that town wher
e she was working. 
Q: Let -- let me -- let me just as
k you a little -- little tin y thing here. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 
 
 
 

 
14
A: Yeah? 
Q: I think in your story I realized that you se
emed to indicate a little 
bit that Frieda asked 
you, and in Frieda™s story, in your wife™s st
ory, I always had a little feeling that -- that 
you asked her. So, who -- who asked -- wh -w ho 
made that -- who made the decision to -- 
you kind of agreed that you would see each other, or wh o -- 
A: Well, this happened -- we -- really, that™s
 a tough question, yo
u know. We don™t know 
how this happened, see? You can
™t tell with the friendshi -- where -- where the friendship 
begin, wh ere that ends and where the love st
arts, you know? It™s hard to -- to say it, see? 
But we like -- we like each other 
so much, so we don™t want to
 be split. We want to meet 
each other and we want 
to continue. And that™s probably 
what we™re falling in love, that 
time. 
Q: So you stayed on -- on her 
f -- on the large -- on the big farm with Frieda™s parents and 
she went to another, smaller farm -- I don™t qu
ite reme mber, about 15 
kilometers, or sort 
of not too far away. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: And you decided to see each other. Bu
t then somebody fo
und out about it and 
denounced  you, right? 
A: Right. 
Q: Do you know who -- what 
kind of person that was? 
A: We had pretty close i-idea, but we -- we 
can™t be assure for 100 percent, but anyway, 
anyway, again, you got some people, they 
say everything, you know, and th ey make a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 
 
 
 

 
15
denunciation. So one s -- that 
was Saturday evening, I driv
e -- I go see Frieda and I -- I 
thi -- finding in that place where we should
 meet. Then after that I find out she was 
arrested, after. So they come 
in and ar-arrest me -- Gesta
po -- police, you know, and the 
police delivered me to the Gestapo in Linz. 
Q: Before you go one from there, let me 
just ask you one mo re
 question. How long, 
roughly, did you stay at her parent™s farm? 
H o w -- how long -- wh-what kind of time are 
we talking about? 

A: Til November. November 
1940, I think. We was arre
sted first time, right?  
Q: So th at was about what, lik
e a half a year or a year? 
A: No, that was almost a year.  

Q: Almost a year, now? 
A: Yeah. 
Q: And then  you were interrogated again, but -- 

A: 11 days. 

Q: 11 days. 
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: But they decided to -- to let you go, and 
to send you to a different -- to different -- 
A: They interrogate me and Frieda, and Fr
ieda says no, there 
was nothing between us, 
just friendship, and same thing I -- I -- I was 
saying. See, because we agree, you know, in 
case we got caught, you know, we should sa
y there was nothing. Actually was nothing, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 
 
 
 

 
16
see, besides you know, we lo -- we love e
ach other, you know, and -- and -- a-and this. 
And so they, after 11 days they let me 
go. That was on Friday, Novemb er 1940. 
Q: But [indecipherable] I™m sorry. 
A: Yes. 
Q: That was a -- 
A: And they  didn't lay a hand on me, they -- 
they -- they were toug
h, you know, they ask 
tough question you know, 
and they  look at me straight in eyes, you know, and th en the 

chief says, well, I think he tell us the truth. 
Okay, we let him go. But, before you go, here 
is the paper and you read this. That was in 
German on one side, and that was in Polish, 
for anything to do, the bottom line, anything 
to do with German or
 Austrian women for 
the Auslander -- for the foreigner, death sent
ence, to hanging. And he says, okay, sign 
your name. So I did sign my  name. And th ey 
gave -- and then th ey let me  go back to 

Frieda™s father to pick up my
 belongings, and they already se
nt -- they had a address, and 
they send me to another farm
er. Little smaller, but also nice 
people. Different direction. 
So on Monday, okay, on Monday 
in the morning they call Frie
da and th ey tell her, okay, 
you free, but you sign some paper. And the same paper, she signed what I signed Friday , 

okay? Tha -- but they  say -- I don™t know what 
this says on -- on -- on that. Well, she read 
the same th ing, you know, deat
h sentence, you know, for anythi
ng to have -- to do with a 
German woman. So you wouldn™t believe, you 
know, by coincident 
I go Friday there to 
Frieda™s father, the farm, pick up my belo
nging and stay over Satu
rday and Sunday, and 
Monday mo rning I take the train and co me back to Linz. And that Mo nday  mo rning

Frieda was going free. And you wouldn™t belie
ve, I was waiting for my  train going in a 
direction and I walk , I don™t know wh at I wa
s thinking, and come head on to  Frieda. I 
thought this is impossible, but I was very ha
ppy to  see. So we go on the side quick, we 
exchanged the addresses. She go fo r anothe
r farm. They didn™t send her home, no, 
another farm. A small -- really
 small farm, th ey needed he
r, and she go there. And again 
we make a agreement that we -- that first Su
nday [indecipherable] fi
rst Sunday, we gonna 
meet there somewhere halfway between li -- Ve
lz and Gunskiha -- oh,
 Velz and Linz on 
the Auterstrassen.  
Q: I think this is a good time to change the ca
ssette here. This is the end of tape one, side 
A interview with Julian
 Noga. This is a -- 
End of Tape One, Side A 
Beginning Tape On e, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of a United States
 Holocaust Memorial Mu
seum interview with 
Julian Noga. This is tape number one, side
 B. So, you both worked on different farms 
now, but you still decided to see each other. 

A: Right. 
Q: But once again you got, even
tually, denounced by the farmer
. Frieda™s farmer at first 
knew about it but decided not to say anything, 
but wh en she decided 
to give up the job on 
that farm to take another job, he decided to 
-- to announce you to th
e -- to the SS, to the 
Gestapo. 

A: Exactly, that™s
 what happened. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 
 
 
 

 
18
Q: Yeah. And so  this time wh
at -- then wh at happened? Yo
u were -- both of -- both of 
you were arrested, and 
you had to stay in -- in jail for 
quite a long time this time, wasn't 
it? 
A: Yes. First Frieda was arrested, and when 
I went there and she didn™t show up wher -- 
where she™s supposed to show up, you 
know, where we meet. Then I had a bad 
conscience or how shou -- bad feeling so
mething might happen, because we were 

supposed  to meet. Then on September 19, on 
that farm where I was 
working, their name 
was Prosmu eller, that was on either side of 
Linz between Linz and Vienna, just a -- oh, 
about four or five kilomete
r from the verywell 
known  concentration camp Mauthausen. 
And that day, on that day, that was again 
Friday. Friday is a bad day for me. Was, at 
least. And we was -- before noon we was di
gging potatoes there on that farm, and I was 
working with that -- with the 
horses, yeah, and we come for lunch, and as we was eating 

lunch, from the -- the other side of the kitche
n, somebody walk in, s
ee? Then we hear the 
conversation. And what I hear, oh he™s very go
od, he™s very hard wo
rking, yeah, he is 
nice man, oh, yes, yes. That™s wh at they say. And that was a policeman. So after he 
questioned -- because the -- the -- the farmer, 
and the -- and the parents, they was eating 
in the kitchen, we was eating in the dining ro
om, see? Then, after awhile, we just almost 
finished lunch, and that policeman come to 
the dining room and says, Julius Noga, I have 

to bring you to the Gestapo, to the Linz. He 
says, I have to bring you to the Linz. I says, 
Gestapo? He says yes. When  I hear that wo
rd Gestapo, I know -- I already knew it is 
Gestapo. I says, oh God. Go od-bye. He sa
ys, okay, you change your clothes, take 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 
 
 
 

 
19
whatever you need like toothb
rush  and soap, when  you had,
 wh atev er, you know, take it 
with you, and you co me with me
. So we go on a station, re
gular station and we take the 
train. That was only 16 kilometer to Linz. So
 what was very hard fo r me to say good-bye 
to this wonderful family, you 
know? They took me as their 
own. They had two children, 
a little girl, Minnie, she was about eight year
s old, and Francel, he was about 10 - 11 
years old. And the children wa
s there, and he ask me, ﬁJulia
n, where you going?ﬂ I says, 
ﬁWell I have to go on Linz.ﬂ ﬁWhat for?ﬂ I sa
ys, ﬁI don™t know.ﬂ ﬁAre you be back?ﬂ I 
says, ﬁI don™t know.ﬂ ﬁOh, come on, Julian,
ﬂ you know? Break my  heart, cause those 
children were so nice. And the farmer come 
and says, ﬁJulian, y
ou have to go. Gosh , 
what did you do?ﬂ I says, ﬁN-Not mu ch.ﬂ ﬁW
ell, I gonna help you all I can, okay?ﬂ So 
the policeman was good to me, I says well, okay,
 ha -- I gotta finish 
with my horses, see, 
I take care of the horses, I gotta give them 
water, I gotta give them some hay, you know? 
He says, go ahead, do it, yeah, okay, we got 
time. So I say good-bye to my  horses. Such a 
big, beau tiful, shiny horses, oh my  gosh. That
 was a break -- a heartbreak. And there was 
a French war prisoner Louie, and I want to ta
lk to Louie because I know he gonna take 
care of the horses, so I told Louie, Louie -- 
he understand pretty good German, I says, 
take care of those horses, they are very ni
ce horses, you know? Don™t beat them, never 
beat them, you know. Treat th
em good, work with them 
slow, don™t rush them, you 
know. Take care of them. He says, I will, I 
will. So I say good-bye to horses and to 
everybody, so we go. Po
liceman had a -- a bicycle, so we walked to the station just a 
kilometer and a half, two kilom 
-- not even two kilometers. Th
en we were ou -- then he 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 
 
 
 

 
20
come to the ma -- where they
 sell the tickets, and there was a man, and -- yeah . And for 
that man, each mo rning he had a -- yeah, ea
ch mo rning I bring some milk, see? He was 
the -- he was the regular old man, you know, hi
gh ranking, and -- and he said -- the police 

ask him question because that was forbidden for 
Polish people to ride the tran -- train. So 
he asked, did you sell any tickets to this ma
n here? And I was behind that policeman, and 
he look at me, and I -- I just make a mo
tion no. And he says, no, I never sell him no 
tickets. Oh, good. So he put a [indecipherable]
 the tickets, or how 
many times he sell me 
the tickets, but he was a very nice man. Hi
s name was Schattsinger. Okay , so the train 
come, and I was standing th ere, and I was th
inking, my gosh, you 
know, should I fall on 
the track, you know, and let the train go over 
me, you know, because I know this time it™s 
going to  be tough, and I kn
ow what I gonna get it. 
Q: You -- you -- you talked a -- you told th at story in a -- on th e videotape, so maybe we 

can just summarize a l
ittle bit by saying that you -- you sp
ent what, 11 months, or quite a 
long time in jail. You tried to get out of ja
il, that was prevented.
 They  found out about 
your attempt to break out, and 
eventually you were sent to 
-- to the concentration camp 
Flossenbürg. 

A: Mm-hm. 

Q: I would like to ask you a few questions 
about Flossenbürg, if that™s all right? 
A: Okay, fine. 

Q: One of the interrogating SS men there, as
ked you during the early
 time, when you had 
just arrived, whether you 
knew why you were sent to
 the concentration camp. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 
 
 
 

 
21
A: Yeah. 
Q: And you said, because of your 
relations to an Austrian girl. 
A: Right. 
Q: And he indicated that that
 was not so, but th at you were
 there for revenge purposes 
too, to pay back, I believe 
you said, you p-payback for th
e German soldiers killed in 
Poland in Begost? 

A: Bidgast. 

Q: In Bidgast. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Did you ever find out wh ether that was th
e real reason, wh-whether that was really 

true? That seems to be a different -- 
A: I think th at was his personal opinion, 
you know, probably he lo st his friend or 
somebody there in Bidgast, that was -- that 
was big outbreak, befo
re the war start over 
there. And probably he take advantage and te
ll me  this in [indecipherable] you know, you 
here for those German soldier 
got killed in Bidgast. That -- I 
was surprised, you know, I -
- I don™t even knew that time where is Bidgast
, as far away from our place where we was 
living.  
Q: Tell us a little bit more about who was ther
e in this concentration camp, where it was a 
stone quarry, where you had to work very 
hard cutting stones. What -- what was the 

population of that camp? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 
 
 
 

 
22
A: That time when I arrived, it was on a Augu
st, I believe August third in 1942. That was 
a small population I should say, not quite 2,
000. And my  numb er 
I -- I received my 
number, I don™t know if that number is ri
ght or not, 1623, that is my  number. 
Q: And what were the nationalities? I mean, 
you were Polish, were there also Jewish 
prisoners, were there Austrian German
 prisoners, wh at was [indecipherable] 
A: Oh yes, that was about 
17 - 18 different nationalities in 
that concentration camp. And 
actually the oldest prisoners was Austrian 
and German. Actually, 
1938, that Austrians 
prisoners, and German, they build up th at 
concentration camp . There was no other -- 
other nationalities than the first. After they bui
ld up that concentration camp, I believe the 
first prisoners come from Czechoslovakia. 
Then, naturally come 
from Poland and o-other 
countries. 
Q: Were people treated differently 
depending on where they came from?  
A: Maybe that was just a little differences be
tween like French prisoners, English -- we 
had some English prisoners, too. Matter of 
fact, two Americans pilot, they was killed 
there, in Flossenbürg. They  run aw ay from 
a stalag, from a regular war prisoners camp, 
and they  was caught by Flossenbürg and th ey 
was brought to Flossenbürg, an d after their 
questioning, they was executed, those two Amer
ican pilots, and they ™re in a death valley 
in Flossenbürg, they go
t the ledge, and American flag, a
nd you can read on th at ledge -- it 
is a big ledge, you know, six feet long and ab
out 36 in ches wide, about eight inches high, 
you know? And that was foun
ded by Polish people, that le
dge, Po lish prisoners. And 
says, two Americans, u n known. But I reme
mber when they wa
s brought to the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 
 
 
 

 
23
concen tration camp, and I remember when  
they was questioned, yeah. And when you 
read those -- you got those ledges, about 17 or
 18 in th e death valley, you go from one to 
the other one, then you see how many people di
e, losted their life in that concentration 
camp in Flossenbürg. You start with the Russ
ian, over 25, 000. The next one gonna be 
Polish ledge, same size as the American led g
e, you know, over 17,00
0. Then  you got the 
French, th en you got the Czechoslovak 
ledges, you know, 3,000 - 4,000 French, 
Czechoslo vak, Italians. And -- and before 
you go any fu rther before th at you got a 
German ledge, and says exactly I want to sa
y 5,969. Something like that. Almost 6,000 
German people losted their life 
-- German prisoners losted 
their life there. That was a 
tough, to ugh concentration camp. When  you 
are in, there was not much differences, you 

know. We was treated almo
st -- almost the same. 
Q: Were there Jewi
sh prisoners, too? 
A: Yes, that was about -- it says on the -- on the -- on a board somewhere, and on a 

chimney, cremation chimney, it says 3,335 Je
wish people lost their life in Flossenbürg. 
Yes, they was there from Po
land, from Hungary, from differe
nt -- German, Jewish too, 
from Germany.  

Q: Were they treated differently at all? 

A: They was treated bad. Yeah
, yeah, yeah, yeah. And they 
was working, you know, they 
give them the -- the hardest work, you kno
w. There was Russian, 
Jewish people, and 
Polish people was tr
eating the worst.

Q: You did, in your videot
aped interviews, speak about a German prisoner, Hans Bauer, 
who -- who had saved your life, twice I believe -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- you speak very highly of him.  
A: More than twice. 
Q: More than twice. We don™t have to say 
that over again, but was there -- w -were there 
other incidents where it wasn™t quite so black 
and white as one sometimes seems to think, 
where other people helped yo
u, who were maybe also Ge
rman, or other nationalities? 
A: Well, Hans Bauer was German
, you know, but he -- if he -- if h e died, God give him 
heaven . He saved me so many times, not only 
twice, so many times, because we come in 
friends in Munich when we 
stay over the night there, and I even  [indecipherab le] his 
cigarettes, and he was a heavy smoker. And he 
says, ﬁOkay, thank you, I can keep this -- 
that bag?ﬂ I says, ﬁKeep it, because I got an
other one.ﬂ And he says, ﬁOkay, you are a 
good fellow, I remember this.ﬂ
 Okay, and later on he become kapo -- foreman, you know, 

and many times he -- he had me, you know, 
I -- and -- and I was so glad, you know? I 
counted the -- once I fall in a 
-- well, the -- the -- th-the ma
in kapo -- kapo in -- in a 
granite quarry caught me during th e wo rk
, you know, and I was smoking. You not 
supposed  to smoke for 12 hours when  you work  
there in the quarry, so
 -- so he gave me 
shtaffkommando, what is shtaffkommando? 

Q: It™s a punishment -- 

A: Outfit. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 
 
 
 

 
25
Q: -- outfit, yeah. 
A: Yes, yes. Now, in  that punishment outfit 
you can™t last mo re than 30 days, you know, 
then you com -- either you 
commit suicide or they kill 
you, you know? And I, thanks 
God, you know, I was there seven or eight da
ys, then one evening I saw Hans Bauer and I 
told him, I™m in a shtaffkommando. He sa
ys, ﬁWhy don™t you told me sooner? Okay , 
tomorrow morning you -- you go w
ith my  outfit to the quarry.ﬂ So  next day I go, and a 
kapo from the other kommando, shtaffkommand
o, he come and says, ﬁHey, you not 
belong over here, come on. You belong to me
.ﬂ Hans Bauer come to him, ﬁNevermind, 
he stay with me.ﬂ Oh. He was surprised 
you know, but you know
, those kapos between 
themselves they don™t want to
 fight, you know? So I was lu
cky that time, he saved my  
life ri -- rig h t there. 

Q: What -- what -- what about the guard s and SS authorities there, was there different 
kinds of -- of treatment, too? 

A: Of course. There was some, not all of them was bad. There was some people like we 

are too, you know. There was some -- was so
me bad ones, and also good ones. And we 
didn™t fright too much SS. What we was fright
ened, the kapos because 
they want to show 
the SS how good they ar
e, they no have to work, you 
know, they ju st you know, had a 
better food, you know, plenty fo od, you know,
 and of course you k
now, hey kapos, you 
gotta be careful with the kapos. 

Q: Did you ever lose faith while you were
 there? I -- I believe you were brought up 

Catholic, right? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 
 
 
 

 
26
A: Yeah. 
Q: Was it -- was a stro ng -- was it a religious 
family, could one say that, or was it not so 
strong?  
A: Ah, y-yes. Hans Bauer helped me because
 I told Hans Bauer se
veral times, tomorrow I 
go co mmit suicide, I go on the barbed wire
, you know, and they
 gonna shoot me, you 
know, I -- just a couple minut
es you know, and I gonna go. [i
ndecipherable] he call me 
crazy, you crazy he says. No, that™s the easie
st way, you know. No, 
no, no, no, no, don™t 
do that. So he -- he helped me. Now, that 
was a time, esp ecial that w as so hard, you 
know, before big holidays gonna come, you 
know, like Ch ristmas, Easter, you know, one 
Christmas, secondChristmas, 
third Christmas and you still th
ere. A nd you ask yourself, 
my gosh, what I did? I didn™t steal, I 
didn™t kill, you know? Because I loved someone? 
That™s wh at I™m here and I™m mixed up w
ith those people over here? And sometime you -
- when you see those execution 
almo st every day, every othe
r day they hang somebody, 
and they had big speeches, then 
you hear those shots every mo
rning before six o™clock in 
death valley, then in the ev
ening. Then  you hear some shots at night, there by the 
crematorium, you know, the black wagon come w
ith some kind of people, go straight to 
the cremato rium, and you hear just a shot
gun, you know? You he
ar -- you hear those 
shots, you know? So today people says, gos
h, you know, some people disappeared, and 
many families, they don™t know how th ey di
sappeared. That was to Flossenbürg wh at 
they disappeared. And sometime -- sometime 
you -- you start to believe -- you start -- 
stop to believe if the God is right. I says no. God can™t see this, you know. And God -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 
 
 
 

 
27
how God let this happen? Then next time,
 you -- you cry, you pray , God forg ive me. 
God, I love you. Please help me. Is so ha
rd, you know, h-how you -- once you ready to 
die, you know, you no
 believe in nothing, you know 
the next time my gosh, maybe -- 
maybe po -- by some kind of coincident like 
Hans Bauer, many times he told me, maybe 
this gonna be some occasion, 
you know. Maybe we gonna be 
free someday. See? We ga -
- but, on the other hand, have all kind 
of professors, you know, all smart people, 
politician and this and this, a
nd on Sunday afternoon I like to 
hear what they say, you 
know? I learned lots from them. 
And they say the one thing what
 they did to us, they not 
gonna let us free. Befo re the Americans or 
Russian, whoever come 
first, before they 
come in, they gonna kill us 
all. So they gonna, how should  I say [indecipherable] -- 
Q: Erase. 
A: -- the evidence. 
Q: Erase the evidence.  

A: Erase the evidence, you know,
 no witnesses. And that was 
possible, and that -- that -- 
that happened in -- in some other c oncentration camp, that what I hear. 
Q: Julian, how lo ng did you stay? How much 
-- how lo ng did you stay in Flossenbürg? 
A: Well, that was when I -- A-August 
third, 1942, til the end, til April 23
rd
, I never forget 
that -- that date. Is a lu cky number. 

Q: And then  the camp was evacuated and you 
were all taken on a death march to -- to 
Dachau. 
A: Dachau . 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 
 
 
 

 
28
Q: But before you reached Dach
au actually, you were liberat
ed by the American army, by 
Patton™s third army , actually. 
A: Right. 

Q: What was your health and your
 mental state at that point? 
A: Oh, you see, th-those -- si
nce F riday, when -- when we 
marched til Monday at noon, 
we was freed. They not give us
 nothing to  eat except I think on Sunday they  gave us a -- 
just a little slice of bread. No coffee, no wate
r, nothing. So we had 
no food, and we gotta 
march so many hours. Sometime they let us r-re
st for three or four hours, in no time we 
march again. So, when you™re
 hungry and th irsty, how -- how you can march? So among 
the -- the -- from my colu
mn , what was almo st 2,000 prisoners
, there was just half of that 
left. And I tell you th e truth, I was prepared to  die, because I was -- I was so weak, you 
know, and each step hurts, you know, and -- 
I -- I-I-I was -- I was dizzy, you know, and 
gosh, you know, but, since in 
the morning I hear th
e machine guns in be
hind, I hear the -- 
we hear that noise, you know, and we unde
rstand that the -- that
 the Americans come, 
you know? So you fight and you 
-- you -- you get your strength,
 the last strength you got, 
you know, to last as long as
 possible, you know. And we 
did it. Gosh, you know, 12 
o™clock, at noon, the first tanks -- American
 tank I saw. First I was mixed up, you know, 
because I see the big white star on their tank
, I thought they are Ru
ssians. But soon we 
find out they are Americans. 
And that was, I believe, 90
th
 or 97
th
 division of that army , 
General George Patton, God give him heaven, 
George Patton, General George Patton. He 
is my , how should I say, he saved my  life.

29
Q: What -- what -- what happened then? Could 
you recuperate in some
 way? Could -- di -
- did you get food? Did you get sent into
 where? What happened  afterwards?  
A: About 10 o™clock, before noon, we passed 
a little to wn by the name Shtamserit. I t was 
in Bavaria [indecipherable]. A
nd then when we was free, we
 go back to that little city. 
And right away, the American takes -- take ca
re of us, you know? They  open  a kitchen, 
they feed us, they give us 
cigarettes. And the American, th
anks to them, many of them 
sacrificed their life, but also many there sa
ve our lives. So I appreciate it very much. 
Thanks to all of them. 
Q: Wh-When you were a little stronger, di
d you go back to Po
land? Did you know 
anything about your mo
ther at that point? 
A: Ah -- 

Q: I should -- I should also sa
y -- we should also say that 
before the outbreak of the war, 
your three brothers, who were also in Po land,
 went back, had been  
gone ba -- had gone 
back to -- 
A: United States. 
Q: -- to United States -- 
A: Right. 

Q: -- again, so it was -- your mother was 
back in Poland. Did yo
u know anything about 
her? 

A: Yes, wa -- I-I wrote her a letter once awhi
le, then I received 
some letters from my 
mother, and so -- also my mother send me 
some packages once in awhile. You know, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 
 
 
 

 
30
bread and onions and little bit pork, you know,
 whatever, yeah. Yeah
, so I know my -- 
my mother was still alive, but 
after I recuperated, after th ree weeks, the American officer 
gave me a bicycle and then I pedal to Austri
a to see my lovely girl. I was -- now, I -- I 
was anxious to see her, you 
know, and how she lives, you 
know, and whether she gonna 
take me back. So -- so I eat that time, from 
the first day I eat. So I starts slowly, you 
know, you can™t overeat it. Bu
t after awhile, you know, I ea
t day and night, wherever I 
can find the food, you know, I ea
t. So I was strong enough af
ter three weeks, and I pedal 
to Austria. First I come to a friend of mine, a
nother friend, Eddie. I di
dn™t -- I didn™t have 
enough guts, you know, go by my self to Frieda
™s father farm, you know? So I took with 
me Eddie, friend of mine. And then  that
 was on Saturd ay, May 
18, 1945, how can I 
forget? And was eight o™clock at night. We
 come to the front door, ring the bell, and 
Frieda™s sister Teresa come out. And when 
she saw me she s-start sc reaming, Julius, 
Julius is here. Frieda was sitting on the back 
porch, you know, when 
she hear that name 
she couldn™t believe it, you kn
ow, that™s me. She was thinki
ng, you know I -- I was dead, 
you know, because they 
-- they -- they -- they hear, you kn
ow, what they was doing in the 
concen tration camp, by their evacuation, and 
she had pretty good idea from Ravensbrück, 
you know, how that treatment wa
s, see?  So she hoped, but 
she wasn™t sure whether I™m 
still alive or not. 
Q: So, th e parents decided to let you stay on 
the farm, o r what -- what -- what happens? 
A: No, I -- I didn 't want to stay on that farm
, but I stayed just a little on the other side of 
the woods, you know, with my  
friend Eddie. And that was nice
 people you know, they let

the American UNRRA we call that, you know, th
ey -- they give us 
packages, you know, 
and fo od, you know, cigarettes and the Am
ericans take of us good, you know? 
Q: Maybe this is another good wa

Beginning Tape Two, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of a United States
 Holocaust Memorial Mu
seum interview with 
Julian Noga. This is tape number
 two, side A. So you had come back to -- to the farm or 
to the village where Frieda lived? 
A: Right. 
Q: And you found housing somewh
ere, some Austrian people th
at you stayed there, with 

your friend? 

A: Yeah, I stay with my friend a-and ju
st not far away from Frieda™s parents. 
Q: And you began to see Frieda again? 

A: Every day.  

Q: What was the reas -- reaction by -- from her 
parents? How did th ey feel about it, di -- 
A: Well, the -- they knew what we was going
 through and they -- th
ey was -- they were 
not against us, you know, they understand, yo
u know. They a -- actually, they understand 

we belong togeth er. 

Q: Did you experience any resp
onses or reactions from the pe
ople in the -- in the village, 
in the area there against or for you? What -- 
what was the relationship? Did you have any 
contact with them? Were there any feelings towards you? 

A: With -- the village there by Frieda™s parents?
 Well, I didn™t have so much contact with 
-- with those Austrians there. They were 
friendly, and I don™t know what they  was 
thinking about me, but Frieda was, you know, 
in a different position, see, wi -- n u mber 
one, she was from a rich family
. And the small village know
s, you know, she was in a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 
 
 
 

 
33
concen tration camp, why sh e was there, they 
know. So that time, y
ou know, you co me to 
the small village like that where the people 
know each other, you know, and this -- it™s 
little bit sensitive, let™s put it this way. So
 Frieda go through something, you know, 
different. To me it didn™t make much difference. 
Q: How did you -- how did you live at that
 time? You got assistance from Americans 
still, or did your par -- did her parent
s help you, or how did that work? 
Q: Red Cross, and the organization -- Americ
an organization UN RRA , we call them that. 
And you had some places, charity places you kn
ow, and they take care of those people. 
Oh, right away they used to
 have those houses, and barracks you know, the Germans 
work er was living before. And th ey put those pe
ople in a -- again, in a camp, but different 
type camp, you know. They  had a good kitche
n, good food. So sometime we go there. I -- 
I didn™t live -- I live only about two months
 in a camp  like th
at, you know, for the 
refugees, camp for the refu -- refugees, but I 
didn™t like that. So many people togeth er, 

you know, that™s reminds me, 
you know? That™s the same th
ing wh at I was going thro ugh 
three years, or so -- so I go and live privat
e and I look for the job. And I become -- I 
worked on a machinerie
s for a -- for a -- for a compan
y. I was the baggerfueh rer, how 
you say baggerfuehrer in Englis
h? [indecipherable] and -- yeah. 
Q: It™s some kind of working 
machine that you drove? Back -- 
A: Bigger, yeah, backhoe, backho
e, bigger, something like that yeah. I was working very  
good job, and I lived  privately, and any time 
I had chan ce I visit Frieda, Frieda visit me, 
you know, and we prep ared to -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 
 
 
 

 
34
Q: And then you deci -- 
A: -- get married. There was no other way, se
e? The -- the only thing is, gonna be a little 
bit hard, you know, because I have to face 
her father and ask him, and I did. No t by 
myself, there was a -- another husband from Fr
ieda™s sister, mar -- Margaret husband. 

And he says, ﬁJulian, I go with you to father, 
you know, and ask, you 
don™t be afraid.ﬂ So 
we go, both of us, you know and I ask. An
d the first thing you know, he ask me, what 
you gonna do? How you plan y
our life? [indecipherable]. We got plenty land, we can 
give you piece of land, and we
 got lum-lumber, you know, bu
ild up the house if you want 
to stay here. And I says no, no, I got 
my family in United States. Oh, well I 
[indecipherable] to America, see, because I 
know there are -- Americ
a is a free country, 
you know, and it doesn™t matter y ou know, whet
her you -- what kind of a nationality you 
are, you know, you -- you live diff
erent. See, but in a small village like that, you are a 
foreigner, you know? They  might say, okay, 
he™s a good man, you know, and this and 
this, you know, but you gonna 
be foreigner forever. Y-You see what I mean? That™s why 
there was only one way for us to -- after we 
get married. Then  he give his okay, yeah, 
okay, so long you go United Stat
es. Yeah, you got your family, 
I hope you take care of 
my daughter. I says don™t worry about that, ye
s I will, I promise, you know. Then, okay, 
we prepared and then we get 
married exactly one year to th
e date when we™re -- when I 
was freed in [indecipherab
le] in Germany, yeah. 
Q: But before you left, 
your daughter was born? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 
 
 
 

 
35
A: Oh yes, yeah, yeah, little Fried a was born 
there in Austria before we come to United 
States, yeah. And -- 
Q: When was she born? 

A: She was born July -- July 12, 
I think, 1946, right, yeah, uh-huh. 
Q: Did you -- did you go back to
 Poland to see your mother? 
A: No, at that time, I liked 
to go to Poland, bu
t that time there was a Communist regime 
and I thought, you know, they 
might keep me there. So I di
dn™t take a chance, but an -- 
after 1960, I decided, fo r good or for bad, 
I decided to go and see my mother. That was 
exactly 21 years when I saw her last time. A
nd that was at Christmastime, shortly before 
Christmas, and that was the ni
cest Christmas for me and for my
 mother to see each other, 
and she was so happy to see me. And then  I st
ay nine days in Po land. Then  I go back to  
Austria, I stay there on a -- on 
a -- nine, 10 days there, then
 I come back and ev erything 
was all right, and I was glad I -- I saw my mother. And she was happy to see me, and she 
know that we got good living 
here in United States because she was here before. Matter 
of fact, she was three times he
re when she was single, you 
know. She traveled back and 
forth, you know, then third 
time when she come [indeciphera
ble] she married my father. 
Q: We will talk about that 
a little bit more when we have reached your life here in 
America in --  
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: -- in the 1960™s. You had never seen, actua
lly, your father, and you had not really seen 

your -- yeah , you had s
een your brothers, but never your father.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 
 
 
 

 
36
A: No. 
Q: Did you know where they were living at 
that time and how did it come about that you 
could go? You need ed  somebody 
to vouch for you, I think? 
A: Yes, throughout the Red Cross I found 
out the addresses for my  oldest brother 
Matthew, and for my father. And I wrote a letter 
to my father. He had to sign the affidavit 
of support, and he did sign the paper and th at™s
 what we come to my
 father and that was 
1948 in March. First time I saw my father. 

Q: How did you get to America? 
A: Through --  
Q: By boat? 

A: By boat, yeah, yeah. 
Q: How was -- tell us a little bit about
 that -- that voyage, that trip. 
A: Oh, that was very excited. That was ve
ry excited, my  gosh, you know? Gosh , you 
know, that was so excited, see 
the America. B efore we come, we
 stay in a -- in a -- in a -- 
we was waiting for -- for visa and -- and the Am
erican, they teach us -- they tell us, you 
know, what is that -- w h at kind of a life we
™re gonna have in a -- America. You got all 
kind of opportunity, if you want
 to work, if you want to sa
ve, you can be millionaire, if 
you want it. See? That was very excited. An d then -- then the boat
 come, you know, and 
we go on a boat. Oh, what a 
good food we had, you know. 
So many people were sick, I 
never was sick. I eat for two, for three, you know, my gosh, you know,
 and I was big that 
time, you know, I weighed, I don™t know, I we
ighed 220 - 240 pounds
. Yeah . So when  I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 
 
 
 

 
37
saw -- was very excited when
 it come to New York. That was, I think, March 22
nd
, I 
think, in 1948 when -- when we
 saw the statue, liberty statue
. I had a tears in my eye. 
And you understand why.  
Q: Could you -- could 
you say that -- I didn™t understand 
what you were saying. You saw 
the statue of -- 

A: When we saw the Statue of Liberty, we 
say, God bless America,
 this is the free 
country and this is Statue of Liberty. What 
I hear so mu ch about the Statue of Liberty 

from my mother, for years. 
You know how emotional it was? I can™t explain.  
Q: Was somebody waiting for you there? Did you -- di -- did they  pick you up?  

A: No, no, we had a ticket st
raight to Utica because my fa
ther was living in New York 
[indecipherable] with his outs -- outsk irt Utica 
and we had a train ticket there, and the -- 
the next day we come to Utica,
 the first time I 
saw my father. 
Q: How was -- how was that -- how was that mee
ting, that first meeting, to see him in -- 
A: You know, it™s hard to e
xplain. Tha-That was a -- it is
 a good question, though. You 
see, I didn™t grow up with my  father, I neve
r saw him, you know? I think my  father mo re 
as a close friend than  father. I can™t help
 it, you know? And he 
was strong, gosh you 
know, and we look like a brother, you know. So
 I think I™m mo re like a brother. And he 
was good to -- to me. There wasn™t many di
scussion, family discussion you know, and 
this, you know, about I wa
s in between, you know.  
Q: Did he know mo re or less what had happen
ed to you? Did he as
k you about it, did you 
talk about that at all? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 
 
 
 

 
38
A: Yeah, yeah, we -- yeah, I told him, I e
xplain him, you know, what it was. I was -- 
spent some time in a co ncentra
tion camp. Yeah, well, too bad, too bad. Well, he says, this 
is fault -- y our mother fault, you know, sh
e shouldn™t go to  Europe, you know, she should  
stay there. Well, on one hand I agree with hi
m, on the other hand I disagree, see, because 
there was some other reason that she 
couldn™t stay here, see? Yeah, yeah. 
Q: So where -- where did you st
ay when you came?  Did you st
ay with your father, or -- 
A: Yeah, first three months were
 stay with -- with my father, 
and right away  they give us 
the job, wi -- was -- Frieda was learning how 
to weaving, and I was 
working in a -- in a 
factory, clothing factory, you know [indeciph
erable]. And I make a good money at that 
time, and we stay three months with my fath
er, you know it™s a little b
it crowded. So after 
three months we get a small apartment in 
Utica on blan din -- Blandina Street, yeah, I 
never forg et that upstairs vi -- over the grocer y stores. That was the Italian grocery stores, 
Jerry, yeah. And we was so happy, my gosh, 
on our own in United Stat
es. Even in a small 
apartment, we were so happy, so free. A
nd then we was work ing and start saving so me 
money. Then in 1952 -- no, ™51 
I think, we bought a small farm
 there, about 15 kilometer 
-- 15 miles from here, Vernon Ce
nter. And we had some chic
ken, about three or 400 
chickens and some cattle. And we were -- 
Frieda wo rked  on th e 
farm, I worked on the 
construction and in the evenin
g I worked on the farm and -- 
and we was very happy, you 
know, that -- I -- I [indecipherabl
e] it is the same thing like 
in Austria, somewhat. Little 
bit different, but we got the own farm, see. B u
t we had that farm for five years, then I 
always had it in my mind, yo
u know, to go to 
my monument business, because that™s 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 
 
 
 

 
39
what I learned in Flossenbürg, you know, cu
t the stones, you know. I was -- that helped 
me too, because I -- really I know when I 
talk about myself how good I was, but I was 
good s -- good stoneconner -- cutter. And wh
en you™re a good stonecutter you get a little 
bit mo re food, you know, and th
at™s what was very important, that™s what my  friend gave 
me advice, you know, if yo
u -- if you w-work  -- do good, and many times, you know, 
they give me special jobs, yo
u know, very co -complicated 
job, and I did it, you know, 
and I belong -- I used to belong to the best 
stonecu tters there in Flossenbürg. Yes, so I go 
to the monument business here. I stotes -- I 
start [indecipherable] I start with a small 
monument busin ess, and after 15 years I go fo
r the big business, and like you see right 
here when  you look at it through th e window,
 that™s our busin ess here, Monument Place, 
and from then up to now we do
 very good, and now my  son Ricky take over, and I just go 
once awhile, you know, he
lp him out a little bit. 
Q: It™s a little bit ironic in a way that 
you found yourself loving a job that you were 
forced to learn in a concentration 
camp, but you liked  it later on, yes? 
A: Yes, yes, yes. I™d -- I tell you the truth, I 
used to like better stone
cutting th an work  in a 
bakery . I didn™t like the dough and flour, y
ou know, and dust, you know? Bu t you got 
dust with the stones too, but -- yes, I -- I li
ke and I like mo nument business and is very 
interesting because every day yo
u got something else to cut, different flowers, different 
sculpture, you know, and letteri
ng and this, you know, and th is
 is very, very interesting 
cause there™s no end to it. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 
 
 
 

 
40
Q: So you were happy to be 
here, and you gradually
 started to build a life. You had your 
own apartment, you rented a farm. But was it al
f -- also difficult, ma
ybe a little bit, to 
adjust to a different country? Was it easy to be with the neighbors in
 some ways, or not? 
A: O-O-Oh yes, oh yes, that -- that, to be h
onest with you, takes not -- I should say about 
10 years, say, because naturally
 there is a entirely differe
nt country than Germany or 
Poland, you know? Different 
system, different -- even fo
od. And different living you 
know? And takes a time, long time to adjust
 you know, to the cu
stom, you know, how do 
it -- how the people live, but you like it. You 
like it, but you gotta 
adjusted to it, see? 
Sometime you grab something to do -- oh no, 
in Europe you go -- do -- do different see? 
But here you do different. Sometimes says no,
 that™s wrong. No , it isn™t wrong when  you 
-- then after you find out, you know, it is right
, see? So it takes awhile to adjust, no matter 
-- I think this is same thing, no matter what 
country you go. It takes 
time to adjust to the 
system, and now, by gosh, after so many years 
we live in this countr
y, what 50 years? 
God bless this country, you know? It is the be
st country  on the earth. God bless America. 
Q: Did you feel the need to 
talk about the experience that
 you went through to anybody 
else but your wife? Did you find yourself ta
lking to neighbors, or 
did people want to 
know, did th ey ask you? 

A: Oh yes, oh yes, and very interesting. Ev
en now, we had several interview, you know, 
on th at radio station wh ere I got my  progra
m every Sunday, was three times there, and 
then we write article to th
e local paper, [indecipherable] 
Dispatch. And many people ask 
us, you know, my  gosh [indecipherable] went 
through, and tell us some more about that. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 
 
 
 

 
41
So I™m glad to tell, and a -- very interes
ting, you know, the younger generation is so 
interested in this story, you know. They  ha
d no idea, you know. Fi
rst they thought, you 
know, that only Jews was in a concentra
tion camp , which is true, nobody can say 
different, see. Jew -- Jewish people suffere
d the mo st, you know, during the war. That 
was a really Ho locaust for them, and they  
had no help  from nowh eres, you know. That™s 
true, you know. Bu t also same time, you mu st say, you know, that many other 
nationalities suffered -- even worse, some of
 them, you know. You take those people in 
Siberia in Russia. My gosh, what they must 
went thro ugh. Even  wo rse, you see? So we 
are glad to talk about this, you know, and Go
d forbid, you know, that
 this never happen 
again, something like that. And young gene
ration, yeah, matter of fact, as you know, I 
wrote the wa -- article of my recollection to 
the book for the high schools teachings about 
the Holo caust. I got my  six pages there, my  story. 

Q: When was -- when was th
at, and who initiated that? 
A: That book? 

Q: Mm-hm, how did that come
 about, and when was that? 
A: Oh that was -- oh, well, because, actually  
the Jewish people start, you know, teaching 
about the Holocaust for 
the high schools, see, in New Yo
rk state. And wh en we find out 
that Jewish people gonna -- 
gonna m-make that book, you know, we also want to be 
there, y-you know, and tell our story, and we
 was accepted. And there™s some Catholic 
Christian stories too, in that book. So ma
ny people ask if this is true, you know, 
especially younger people. Is that true, or 
it is just a propaganda? 
You know, that gets 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 
 
 
 

 
42
you a little bit. What kind of
 a propaganda? Th-This not 
propaganda, I got so many 
evidence, films, books, by gosh, people was ther
e like me, you know. I no lie. I tell -- see, 
who gon -- whoever gonna listen 
to this tape, you know, I 
can™t lie, you know, because 
somebody can straighten me out, hey wait a mi
nutes. You -- you -- you lie about this, or 
something like that. So we give you that -- 
that -- that true story where we was going, 
true, and what we saw, what we experience that time. 

Q: So did you feel that your 
experience as a P o lish inmate in a concentration camp was a 
little bit forgotten by 
history, in a sense? 
A: I think -- I think it is enough books 
and mention ab out the Polish people suffered 

during the second World War. Don™t forget. Bu
t that was a -- we say six millions Jewish 
people losted their life during the second 
war. Oh my gosh, about six million Polish 
people, Christian people sacrificed their lifed u ring that war. So maybe -- maybe this is 

not the -- how should I say it? 
This is a little -- a little bit 
difficult question. But maybe it 
is -- maybe doesn™t -- maybe -- maybe the hi
story doesn™t say enou
gh, you know, about 
Polish people, and not only Polish people, wh
at about other nationalities? What about 
Russian? What about the other nationalities 
suffered so many? How many Russians, how 
many millions, they die, you know? And th
is -- those people gotta be taken to 
consideration too, you know. 
Not only one nationality, see? A
ll of them. And I am glad 
we had an invitation to Holocaust, to Washingt
on, and we told our story. They treat us 
nice, you know? And I told them the same 
story wh at I tell you right now, that -- and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 
 
 
 

 
43
we™re speaking about the Jewish people, yes th ey suffered the most, a
nd they  had no help  
from nobody, yeah. 
So we was a little bit more lucky,
 you know, let™s put it this way. 
Q: I would like to come back to
 this a little later, but let™s go 
back in time again to th-the -
- mo re the beginnings of your fam
ily here. You had a second child?  
A: Yeah, Richard was born 1951, in January . 
Yeah, and he grow up
 here as a hundred 
percent American, okay? And he™s 
still single, he is with us. 
He got his house next to us, 
he bought a house, he living in his own hou se. And he take over our monument business 
and he wo rk there. And he ha
d a college, yeah, educated . And 
daughter Frieda, she™s also 
-- oh my  gosh, how many languages she speak?
 Sh e even  speak th e sign sa -- language 
and she™s a foreman for the organization for 
the deaf people. Right now she is in New 
York City, there for a whole we
ek. She got a meeting there. 
And she is close to us, she 
live in Syracuse. And we got 
nice two children and two gran
dchildren, yeah. And we are 
very, very happy. It wasn™t 
so easy. There was a hard wo
rking, you know. Frieda was 
working hard, I was working hard
. So we come to this, what
 we today got, you know, we 
are not millionaire, we -- we are not rich. 
But we make a good living and we are very 
happy. 

Q: When  you had your childre
n, did you have certain drea
ms for them? Did you -- did 
you know what you wanted to gi
ve your children, wh at you wanted them to be, certain -- 
A: Ah, this is another tough 
question, yeah, and I have to  
tell you that true. Yes, many 
times come to me, and to be 
honest with you, sometime I not 
believe that happen to me, I 
go th rough this, you know, that wasn™t me. Th
en I think, you know, yes, that was me. I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 
 
 
 

 
44
go th rough this. I give you example. How ca
n you feel, let™s say January, February, you 
know, you™re co -- you work 10 hours, wi
ntertime I was working 
10 hours in a quarry. 
You come, they counted you, 
somebody™s mi ssing, okay? Th
e wind blows, snow, cold, 
below zero, you know? You stay without a 
hat, you stay [indecipherable] what that 
means, attention? 
Q: Attec -- yeah, attention. 

A: Yeah. And th ey co unt and count, one pris
oner is mi ssing and you 
stay there for two, 
three hours, hungry and cold, 
don™t move. How can you this e
xplain to anybody what that 
is? So, those days, you know, happened  many
 times. Coming back to me. I say s, how can 
you -- or how can you go throu
gh this? This is impossible, yeah. That was possible. 
Yeah, so sa -- those -- yeah, 
every time you see those faces, 
you know, familiar faces, SS, 
commandant, inspection, you know.  

Q: So this -- 

A: And you thought this is
 no end to it, you know? 
Q: So it seems very unreal to you now? 
A: Yes.  
Q: Did you -- but m-my question was actually
, did you have any --
 di -- how did you 
want your children to  bri -- how did you want
 your children to gr
ow up? Did you have 
certain dreams for them? Something that
 you wanted to give them, or -- 

A: No, no. 

Q: -- how did you want to do pa
renting? Did you have any -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 
 
 
 

 
45
A: We didn't talk mu ch abou
t that, and even now we no ta
lk much about 
that, you know, 
and thanks God, w-was going thro ugh, it di
d -- didn™t affect our 
mi nd, you know, or 
nervous break or something like that, no. No . 
I always got answer for myself an d Frieda 
same thing, you know. Thanks
 God. Could be a worse, you know. Bu t time to time you 
know, it comes, you know. So me happenin gs, you 
know, what is hard 
to believe, even fo r 
me, even for me, I saw it with my ow
n eye wh at happened, you know? Yeah. 
Q: Did your children ask you

Q: This is a continuation of a United States
 Holocaust Memorial Mu
seum interview with 
Julian Noga. This is tape number two, side 
B. Did you make any friends that came from 
the same ex perience, that also went through
 a concen tration camp  experience, jail or 
prison? 
A: We™re still in contact with a few others. On
e of them is a very close friend to me, Dr. 
Jake Terry, T-e-r-r-y. He is a doctor in New 
York City, and he is
 very active in ex-
prisoners organization, he go [indecipherable]
 every year. He had -- they had meetings, 
you know, and they  make lots 
of changes there in a concentration camp. Like I said, the -
- the Laundromat was located in a -- in a wash
room wh ere we used to take a shower. All 
the electric factory was located in a kitchen,
 our kitchen used to be. And some French 
company built up the little factory there, right 
in a concentration camp. And Jake didn™t 
like that, and I didn™t like that, and we discussed it, and Jake, with the rest of it -- 

members o f that organization, they put th
e pressure on the Bavarian  government to 
eliminate those priv ate -- or in a commandant ure, there was a regular, people was living 

there, you know, like a apartmen
t, they change for the apar
tment. So those people was 
move and they gonna remodel that building in
side, and they gonna keep it as a museum, 
see? And the washroom gonna be remodel in
side, they moved the Laundromat, and the 
kitchen an d the appelleplatz, the square wh
ere we used to ha -- you know, when we 
would get togeth er, you know, the -- the appe

47
some trees gonna -- bushes gonna
 be cut, and you know -- a
nd they gonna bring it to the -
- mo re to the same  look as it was that time, y
ou know. And th at -- thanks -- thanks to ja -- 
Dr. Jake Terry and Paul Wash. Paul -- Paul Wa
sh, he just recently received a medal from 
Israel, Israel government, because him and hi
s father save quite a few Jewish people 
during th e war, you know, he was awarded, yo
u know, as a -- a -- as
 a -- a -- as a man 
who saved some lives, you know,
 and he lives in New Yo rk 
City, and we are in contact 
too. 

Q: Did you go back -- ever 
go back  to Flossenbürg? 
A: Oh yes, several times, yes, yes. The firs
t time was the worst. When I came to the little 
mu seum what they got in
 there by the cremation there, no
t far away. Then I looked at it, 
all pictures, the commandant and the -- how 
the prisoners was working in a quarry and 
this and this, then in the middle I saw the pr
etty good size picture there, and there was a 
bunch of prisoners, and there was a kapo, an
d -- and -- and th ey was receiving the soup. 
And guess what? I recognize my self. Then I almos -- I almost
 fainting, you know, I -- I 
couldn™t believe it, I called Frieda na -- says, ﬁFrieda, look at this picture, and you see 
anything unusual?ﬂ She looked  at it closer, sh
e says, ﬁJulian, that™s you.ﬂ Second in  a -- 
in a first ro w, you know, yeah. And then -- th
en I remember, you know, and we go -- that 
was the first day in a -- in a -- a qua
rry. After two week s where we was on a 
[indecipherable] block, the newcomers bloc
ks, you know, we was there 14 days, that™s 
the time, y ou know, the SS 
officer ask me, you know, if
 I know why I am here, you 
know, and -- yeah. And then -- 
then I remember there was a small -- we make a joke 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 
 
 
 

 
48
[indecipherable] I remember th
is exactly, you know, becaus
e usually the SS was tall 
guys, you know, and this, but th
at photographer SS man, he was a -- a little guy, red hair. 
And he had a big camera, you know, like a ac
cordion, black one. And he make the 
picture and says, no wonder -- we
 make a joke out of it, no 
wonder, you know, they no 
want him on the front, you know, 
this -- he™s got the right job 
just to make a picture. And 
that picture -- who knows how, 
you know, survive and I™m -- a
nd this is the best evidence 
you know, if somebody says no, 
you wasn™t there. And why I -- 
this is very interesting -- 
why I know that was the firs
t day in the quarry, because we
 had a -- a wooden -- wooden 
shoes, you know, wooden soles. And then  a -- 
and that same day I was -- they gave me to 
the kettakommando, we -- we climbed a -- in 
a quarry, you know, on 
a stone, and we™ll 
put the ke -- chains around the 
big blocks an d the crane pull 
them out from the -- from the 
quarry. And they give us leathe
r shoes. So that first day, 
I™m standing th ere with wo oden 
shoes that I know that was from August, let™
s say 17 - 18, August 18, 
ni -- 1942, see, the 
picture was made. And I™m on that picture.  

Q: When was that first tr
ip when  you went back? 
A: Oh gosh, the -- for a long time I no want to go
 there. I told you th e truth. I didn™t want 
to see it. I was scared, you know? But then
 we decided, me and my  family, Frieda, 
daughter Frieda and son Richard to go. And 
th at was -- I believe, you know, I can™t tell 
you exactly the -- whether -- that was ninese -- 
1980 -- ™83 - ™84, I come first time to the 
Flossenbürg. Was everything change, you 
know. The trees grow
ing you know, bushes 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 
 
 
 

 
49
growing, then I see their factories there, th
en the -- all barracks go
ne, they got the one 
family houses, you know, wh ere the barra
cks was there. I didn™t like it.  
Q: How -- how did your children respond to 
th at? Did you have a feeling that they 
understood something in  a diffe
rent way than before, or what was their response?  
A: The daughter -- daughter Frieda want to
 run away, you know, fro
m that concentration 
camp. She couldn™t -- you know, she was shakin
g, you know, and she couldn™t believe it 
when she saw the cremation ove
n, you know, it™s still there, 
you know, untouched, yeah. 
And when she saw that, she knew,
 and she see those pictures, see my picture over there, 
she want to run away . But we make videotapes 
there and they stay, th
en -- then after that 
we go -- we go Germany, Austria, most every 
two, three years we go there, you know, we 
still go on there, you know, because Frieda got 
some relatives there, sisters. And when 
we go there, naturally, we stop in Flossen
bürg, you know, just look at, you know, and -- 
Q: W-Why -- 
A: Is -- is interesting though. 

Q: Yeah, that was -- th at was my -- my ot
her question. Why did you
 decide to go back 
after the first time? W as that im
p o rtant to you to go
 back to that place for some reason? 
A: Yes, because I -- I was ta
lking to some people, they were there. And I says, you 
should go, you should see, 
there™s -- everything is chan ge, but a few houses, you know, 
and a few things are still there. It is a be
autiful chapel build up  from the towers, you 
know, watch towers. Beautiful chapel. And 
I thought, my gosh, maybe I should go and 
see that place and go to that chapel and th
ank God, you know, we 
survive, you know. So 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 
 
 
 

 
50
we go and I™m glad we go, we -- we saw an
d after that we go almost every two years 
there, and we stop there, and that mo st importa
nt to be there, that was 50 anniversary, you 
know, when the concentrati
on camp  was free, liberated. And you wouldn™t believe -- 
before we go there -- first I thought I don™t kn
ow, should we go or 
not? But, one of the 
guy from Arizona, his name i -- was Bob Hager, he find out about me in a United States 
Holo caust -- he saw the movie, and he ca
lled me, and he -- over the telephone he 
introduce himself and he says, ﬁI™m the one 
from the Third Army , I open the gate there, 

in concen tration camp Flossenbürg.ﬂ I says, 
ﬁOh my  gosh. Thanks. Where you live?ﬂ Oh, 
here in Arizona, I retired, so and so, and wa
 -- I was in a 97 division of Third Army , 
General George Patton. So this gonna be 50
 anniversary and I™m in contact with the 
Munich government there, with the minister
, and I got invitation and probab ly you gonna 
get invitation too. And we sh
ould go, and we should meet th
ere. I says, okay, we go. 
Yeah, then I go with the whole family. But befo
re, I says, I want to do so mething. Then I 
call Bob, and I told  him over the telephone wh
at I want to do. Some kind of mark, like a 
bronze plaque, to thank Third 
Army for liberation. He says, yes, that™s a good idea. I 
gonna call up Munich and I gonna tell them, 
you know, and they  
gonna find a place 
where they want to put that 
-- that plaque. Good, good idea
. So he called me back, he 
says, yes I already -- I already talked to mini
ster so and so in Munich. I says, good idea, 
and that plaque what Julian Noga gonna desi
gn, we can put it in death valley on a wall. 
There is a wall there between th
e chapel and -- and death valle
y, and he can put it there. 
And wh en he -- when  he make this plaque, 
I give him the help, and they help  him, you 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 
 
 
 

 
51
know, to -- to place that plaque
 there. Okay. So I design th
at plaque. I put pretty good 
size, oh I don™t know, 28 in ches by 18 inch es 
high bronze plaque. And th en I put in the 
left corner on top, I put American Sherman ta
nk. Then  in right corn er on top I put that 
emblem, the -- from that 97 division emblem th
ey had, there is lik
e a fork, like a devil 
fork or something like that, 
you know? That was the emblem
 for the division. So I put 
that emblem in the right corner
 on top and then I say, well,
 thanks to the American, you 
know, for liberation this and this, then 
I put Julian Noga, num
ber 1623, and other 
prisoners, to thank Americans, see? So when
 we -- when I -- when I bring that plaque 
over there, I had two work ers th
ere, what they take care of that place, and they  had the 
drill, and they, you know, we already to ld th
em, you know, how this 
gonna be put in the 
wall, in the granite wall. And they drill up th
e -- for me, four holes
, you know, and I set 
that plaque my self with my  own hand there.
 And that was somethi
ng so  -- so -- Saturday 
and Sunday there was a big doing, speeches
, you know, and people
 coming from all over, 
ex-prisoners, you know, there wa
s -- they say was about 7,000, I don™t know it was 7,000 
there. There was Dr. Jack Terry
 th ere, there was -- with his daughter, and there was Paul 
Wash there -- Wash, he was with his wife, a
nd there was some other prisoners there from 
New York City, from Po
land come in whole -- two bu
ses come in  from Poland, ex-
prisoners, and fo r German ex-prisoners, and from all Czechoslovaks, Russians, you 
know, from all over, lots of flowers, some sp
eeches, you know, and th at was very, very 
interesting. And we had a sp
ecial praying that chapel, th
ere was a German bishop, you 
know, special prayer for all of us, you know.
 That was very -- and th e Jewish people had 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 
 
 
 

 
52
a nice ceremony th ere, by the Jewish mo nument 
and also they had prayer and we was 
with them and th at was very emotional, you
 know, we -- we feel like brothers, you know? 
That doesn™t mean you are Jewish or German
 or Po lish or wh atever, or Czechs, or 
French, you know? We was like -- like br
others, you know? We respect each other 
because only we know what
 we was going through.  
Q: Is remembering -- 
A: So -- excuse me, I didn™t finish yet, ye
ah . And the Bob was there, the Bob Hager, he 

was there and when it come time,
 you know, the plaque was c
overed with th e white cloth. 
When it come time, th e -- Bob Hager and me, 
we unveiled that plaque in death valley 
there, where the execution they  had almo st
 every day th ere, you know, with so many 
people die over there, and that was a gr
eat moment you know
. And Bob Hager lay 
beautiful -- with his wife Peggy, he lay a b
eautiful flowers there by that plaque and that 
was very -- he put, and then after that 
there was a program, you know, and th ere was 
many speeches there from different nationa
lities, you know? And even the mayor from 
Flossenbürg, he says, I am 56 years old, 
I was born after the war. I™m sorry, you know, 
that you people have to got th
rough this. I™m sorry that our 
quiet, willa -- village come on 
a map as a certain -- as such a bad place. He
 had a nice speech, and says, of course, we 
are not responsib le for this what happen in ou
r quiet village, but also we got th at black 
spot in our history. I™m 
sorry for that. Such a beau
tiful speech he had.  
Q: Were there other responses from -- from Ge
rmans? Did people approach you in  any 
way, did you hear any kind of re
action from people who were there? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 
 
 
 

 
53
A: Oh, my gosh, there was a -- there was 
another -- another mayor from Ravensbrück, 
there was some high officials, you know, and 
they co me -- they fo
llow us, they ask us 
question. And television cameras and -- and a 
radio -- those people from the radio station, 
you know. Gosh , we was so bus
y, you know, and th ey ask que
stion, you know, and th at 
was very interesting, you know, very interest
ing. And again I say that usually younger 
generation, you know, that was so -- for them
 that was so interest
ed, you know, what it 
was, that -- Flossenbürg concentration camp. 
Q: Is reme mb ering important to 
you? Apparently it is, but is it 
-- i -- is also painful, but -- 
but is it -- is it important to you to remembe
r, and what do you do 
to keep the memory 
alive when you are getti
ng older and older -- 
A: Yes, well this is -- I got my own explana
tion for myself, see? That was a wartime, and 
gosh in a wartime, ma ny, man -- this no -- no war, you know, is honest on either side, you 

know. And during th e wartime so many people 
had it worse, maybe worse than -- than -- 
than -- than me, you know, like take any Jewish
 family, you know, like 
I meet -- even the 
Dr. Terry, you know, he losted a whole fami
ly there, he is by himself. And many other 
Jewish people, you know, they  losted thei
r whole family, you know? And also some 

Polish people losted their fam
ily in a concen tration camp , and -- and was -- you know, 
there could be a worse, you know, but maybe 
of this experience I explain my self, what 
we was going th rough, maybe ma ke a -- maybe 
this experience make me a better man, 
you know, and that™s why I™m 
so busy, you know, with this
 social organization, you 

know, and I try help other people. And I try te
ll the people that life can be a different, you 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 
 
 
 

 
54
know. And, you know, it bothers me when I 
see that the American, you know, make a 
demonstration, and sometime they burn th e Am
erican flag, you know, that hurts. I -- I 
say, people, you don™t know wh at you™re do
ing. You don™t know that the life can be a 
different. And matter of fact, you know, if I 
was young boy wh en  th
e older people says, 
you know, what they  was going 
through the first World War, I laugh and I says, ah what -
- they say they eat rotten potatoes, you know 
and this and this. My gosh, it™s happen, I no 
have to wait long en ough and I eat rotten potato
es. I -- and this is hard to believe, why 
rotten potatoes? I tell y ou why. 
When a potatoes is rotten, y
ou cu t the bad -- bad part out 
of it, and rest of it is little bit yellish -- 
brownish, you know? Rotte
n potatoes is sweeter, 
and healthy potatoes is bitter, th
at™s why. So I remember what
 the older people says, we 
used -- then we was so hungry
 we eat the rotten potatoes. Ye
s, I understand, now, see? So 
-- but when a -- when it comes -- you know, 
at that time, I didn™t pay my  -- m- mu ch 
attention, you know, oh gosh
, there was a first World War. 
So what? So what? They was 
born in wrong time, you know, I was born af
ter the war, you know, I™m lucky. But by 
gosh I not have to wait too long -- too long,
 you know, to go ma
ybe even worse what 
they was going through. See, th en I find out -- that™s why, y
ou know, that experience, that 
life what we had, maybe make a be -- 
better man out of me, you know? Maybe I 
appreciate it mo re, what we 
had, you know, the life, th
e freedom, you know. What is 
really important. 
Q: You mentioned social work or some char
ity work. Tell us a little 
bit more about that. 
When  did you start doing it, and wh at is
 it, actually, that you are doing? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 
 
 
 

 
55
A: Well, first when we come -- when we come
 to this country, there was that time, you 
know, when President Tr
uman was president, and a -- of 
United States, and he made that 
President Truman Act, you know, for the DP
 persons, for the -- for those people who 
couldn™t go back to the Communist country , y
ou know, so they -th-
the border was open 
for -- to this country  you know, and here in
 Utica, besides me, come in -- ma ny, many 
people come in. Some of th
em was in the concentration camp, but most of them, you 
know, they was work ing 
in the -- on the farms, like I was 
working on a farm first, and in 
the factories, you know? Then we -- well, we 
come to this country 
like I told you from 
the beginning you know, e-everything was stra
nge over here, was beautiful but strange. 
So we organize ourselv es, and I 
was one of the co-org an izer i-in this organization. We 
named that organization the newcomer™s organi
zation, see? So we started making sh ows, 
you know, and whatever mone
y we had, we have some orphans in Germany, some 
widows, you know, the money was going
, you know? There was like a charity 
organization. And th anks God, you know, I wa
s 35 years president of this organization. 
Then  I organized another organization wh at 
is Kopernik Memory Association. So my 
idea was to have another organization with  
the Polish background, 
you know, to tell us 
about the Po lish history, you know, Polish 
culture. And same tim
e we collect enough 
money, you know, on 45,000 dolla
rs, and we build  up the beautiful statue here in Utica. 
That was my idea, I must say, Kopernik stat
ue, 21 feet high and stays right in the center 
of the city of Utica, across the street fro
m th e Munson Proctor Ins -- Institute -- museum, 
see. And I™m very proud ab out that, and we 
had other people, you know, I like. Then I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 
 
 
 

 
56
start radio program, Polish an
d international music I play 
every Sunday for two hours on 
the local station here, on th e other side woods 
there, you know, I can walk over there, you 
know, I live close to it. And this is my hob
by and I™m very happy, you know, very busy 
you know, between radio stati
on organization, I belong to qu
ite a few of them, and our 
busin ess, you know. Keep me busy, I get no ol -- no time to get old. 

Q: Did you keep up a little b
it with the discussion about Jewish-Polish relationships in 
Poland in the 70™s, and 
then in the later 80™s this become
 a -- a difficult discussion to -- in 
Poland, to di -- to discuss that mo re openly th
an it was before. Did you keep up with that 
a little bit? Do you think it™s 
-- the -- the process of workin
g through this 
very difficult 
subject matter is -- is happening? 

A: This is a -- a very delicate question, you kn
ow. I grow up with the Jewish people, as I 
told you from the beginning, you
 know. Matter of fact, I had the Jewish girl, we was very 
close with the -- nothing was there, not -- we
 was not in love, no, absolutely. But we 
grow up together and thanks God, you 
know, she survive, you know. She had the 
Christian paper, she emigrate to
 Germany. She was wo rking on
 a farm in Germany, as a 
Polish girl and she married a Polish guy, y
ou know, and her father was killed, and -- 
during the war, and her motherwas killed, too, you know, a
nd sh e was the only one there, 
you know. So we grow up w
ith th e Jewish people and I had nothing against the Jewish 
people there in -- in -- in 
Poland, absolutely, you know
. That was a -- more like a 
tradition, you know, if you want to buy some
thing you go in a Jewish store, you know, 

you buy, you know, you get go
od deal, you know? Bu t -- and 
Jewish people in Poland, I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 
 
 
 

 
57
think there was about three and 
a half -- three and a half milli
on Jewish people in Poland, 
you know. There was mo re Jewish
 people in Poland that time 
than today in Israel, see? 
And -- and they had businesses, 
they had heavy in dustry that was in Jewish hand, too, 
and I think they was treating, you know, very
 well, they -- we had doctor and -- doctors 
and professors and scientists
 and all kind of -- you know, 
and that was -- that was -- I 
think they was treating good. But here, after y
ears, time to time, I se
e some articles in the 
paper that -- that we aren™t -- that we are, 
Polish people, anti-Semitic.
 Now, this is, to me, 
a little bit hurts me this, this accusation. Beca
use I wasn™t anti-Semitic. I live -- I had a 
friend, Jewish friend, and I still got Jewish fri
end here. Jake Terry is a example. I have 
here in Utica many Jewish people are goo
d friends, close friends. And that hurts 
sometime when they accuse us
, you know, to -- that the 
Polish people are anti-Semitic, 
yeah. Well, gosh, you know, I don™t know wh
at they mean. Well, this happened -- see, 
our -- somebody, you know, another Chris
tian make a denunciation on me, you know, 
about the [indecipherab le] what I tell you 
about, you know? How about Frieda, you 
know, some people make a denunciation. So  
you got bad people here, here, and I believe, 
you know, maybe that was so
me anti-Semitic, you know, in
 -- in Poland between some 
kind of people, you know, not
 -- not me, you know. And when  you say the Po lish people, 
then you talk about all Polish 
people, that I™m included, ex 
-- as a -- as a -- a -- from a 
Polish background, you know? A
nd we -- I think we shouldn™t 
say that, that -- you know. 
I believe that some people was anti-Semitic
 and maybe today you -- you -- you™ll find 
them, see? Like you find here 
in this country, anti-American
 people, right? Yeah? When I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 
 
 
 

 
58
listen to -- to Rush Limbaugh
, you know, I wonder -- I wonde
r, you know, what kind of 
an American he is, you know, when  he called 
our president stupid, a
nd a liar and this and 
this, call him name, you know? That™s for me 
-- that hurts me , too, you know? I mean, 
this is a very delicate -- delicate question, 
you know, between the Christian and Jewish 
people in Poland. But I think 
th at Poland opened the border 
for seven century, when  the 
other countries, you know, chase out the Jewi
sh, you know, like Spain or other countries 
chase out the Jewish people, Po land take 
th em, you know, and fo r seven centu ry , the 
Jewish people was in Poland
. And my  gosh, you know, maybe
 there was some  incidents, 
you know, I don™t know about 
that, see? But as I remember, 
you know, like y-you take a -
- even little city like 
Struchin or Tarnów. My gosh, th
e -- most of the population was 
Jewish population and the busin esses, mo st of

answer, you know.

Q: This is a continuation of the United Stat
es Holocaust Memorial 
interview with Julian 
Noga. This is tape number three, side A. I w
ould like to go back in
 time a little bit when 
your children were young. What -- what was 
your life like then? 
You both worked? Di-
Did your wife still work? 
A: That™s right. I worked firs
t shif t, she worked second sh
ift, or the other way. She 
worked first shift and I worked 
second shift, th -- so we wa
s with -- one of us, you know, 
was with the children, see? 
Q: But that was not an  easy -- an easy life. 
A: Was kind of tough, but we
 didn™t know the difference and 
we do our best, and by gosh 
you know, we was thinking, y
ou know, to let the children gr
ow in a -- in a good house, 
you know, and later on they 
get good education and we was very successful with this, 
thanks God.  

Q: Say a little bit more about the education of
 your children. They 
got -- they went to 
high school and then  to college, both of them? 
A: No, Frieda, which is our ol
 -- older -- older daughter, let™s put it this way. Yeah, she 
was born in Austria. She go high school, th
en she take some courses, you know, like 
typewriting and shorthand. And she was very
 good with the langua
ges, so she speak 
fluently, she take German in the high school
. She speak fluently Ge rman, fluently Polish, 
English. And after she get married she take 
another course to speak sign language. And 
now she has good job in  Sy racuse, New Yo rk. 
And she is the boss th
ere, you know, she™s 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 
 
 
 

 
60
got a group of people she wo rk
 for, then -- and she do very
 good with  the sign language. 
And she is good for the catch up -- with the 
languages, to learn, and -- other languages, 
let™s put it this way. Okay, and Ricky, Ric
ky was different, you know? She learned a little 
bit German, he can keep the 
con -- conversation in -- in Ge
rman and in Po lish. And he 
finished the high school, a
nd then she go -- then he go college, yeah. And after he 
finished the college, he get a 
good job, he work  for the big 
insurance company as a safety 
inspector. But the insu ra
nce is -- lately, you know, they ch
ange a little bit, and same time 
I need him here for our busin
ess, you know, because we want to co ntinue with th e 
busin ess after oh, you know, after 40 years I bui
ld  up that business and I -- I don™t want 
to let it go, so I invite him here, and he is al
ready wh at, four or fift
h year with me, and I 
teach him how to carve, how to do the monuments 
and he is very, very good in that, he™s 
got a good hand, cause -- because he™s a little pa
inter on the side, you know, that picture 
you see over here on the wall, that™s his painti
ng right there. Which is pretty good, I -- I 
should say. So in th e monument busin ess, he 
is pretty artistic and he™s got new idea and 
put the new designs, new flowers, new carving
s, you know, he is good fo r that, and I™m 
glad, you know, so the name stay
s in busin ess after I go, see? 
Q: Was -- was he naturally interested, or di
d you -- or -- or was -- wh-what did he do 
before? Was that sort of a natural interest of
 him when you asked hi
m, or did you had to  
put a little pressure on him to
 say please, you know -- 
A: Well, like I said, you know, he had a -- afte
r he fini -- finished the college, he had a 
pretty good job there in Michigan there. And 
that was going good fo
r awhile, then getting 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 
 
 
 

 
61
a little bit slowdown and [indecipherable] 
and when he come home we had a good 
discussion over here, and I told  him simp ly
, you know, I getting ol
der, you know, and 
here is the busin ess, you know, everything, a
ll the equipment, trucks, all equipment, you 
know, just -- what you need ju
st to start working, you know
, and I teach yo
u, you know? 
He had pretty good idea though, because he 
grow up actually, into 
the business. But no 
matter what, you know, you™ve got
 to practice, and you know, 
you got to learn. So -- and 
he was -- he learned quick, you know, how to do
 that monument job, see? Yeah, so he is 
pretty good with it 
and I am glad.  
Q: What -- what -- what do you consider kind 
of highlights in your life here in America? 
Was there anything that was especially proud 
f -- proud thing for you, or something that 
sort of stands out? 
A: The -- the big -- big day for us, me and Fr
ieda was when we become citizens of this 
country. I get my paper in 1956 and she™s 
got her citizenship paper, ™58 -- eight? ™57. 
That was the great moment, you know, when  
we become American citizens, you know. 
And this is a -- a very touchy -- I should say privilege, you know, for anybody love this 

country. And numb er two, for the first time 
in my  life, you know, wh en it comes election, 
you know, so we can go to th
e election place, and we can vote, you know, that means so 
mu ch to us. So that day, af
ternoon is off by us, like a holid
ay. We dressed up. I never go 
without a tie, you know, to vote
, you know, this special privile
ge to me. And we feel very 
comfortable we can vote, because we never vot
e before. So that was -- yeah, that was the 
wa -- couple highlights which occu r, you know, 
in our life, you know, speaking about the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 
 
 
 

 
62
citizenships and -- and all the [indeciphera
ble]. Then, of course, you know, our 25
th
 
anniversary of marriage, then 50 anniversary 
of the marriage, quite 
some time ago, that 
was a highlights, too. And ma
ny times happen in organizati
on who I belong, they gave 
me some certificate for the 
good job, you know. They  ma
ke a special banquet for us. 
There was one banquet for that 50 anniversar
y of liberation of concentration camp . The 
Polish community make a special banquet fo
r us, we had about 250 people, and many 
congratulation and there was a high offici
al from the county, from the city, and 
congratulate us. And that was very interesti
ng to us, we turn a little
 bit back, you know, 
to accept a invitation from United 
States Holocaust in Washingt
on, D.C.. I must say that 
was very interesting, and very important to us
 to tell our story for the future generation, 
you see? And I must say there, in Holo caust, 
they treat us like a royal, you know? Really, 
you know, we enjoy ev ery minute there, 
when we was there and something like 
Holocaust -- United States Holo
caust in Washington, this is very important and I give 
credit to the organizer that™s
 -- that -- that -- that m-mi
serable time we lived through, 
second World War, that is not 
forgotten, you know, th at 
is somehow documented, you 
know, right there, and this is United States 
Holocaust in Washington, and I give a credit 
to those people, organizers, donors -- and we
 are donors of -- a-also. Yeah. So metime I 
mix, you know, wo rd German, you ex
cuse me, when I speak English. 
Q: I can translate, that™s -- that™s all right. 
What did -- what did y
ou give to th e mu seum, 
for example?  
A: Well, first of all, we -- we gave some 
money, donation, yeah, yeah . Co uple times -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 
 
 
 

 
63
Q: But you also gave some objects, I think? 
A: Yes, we gave many pictures, that™s what
 they ask us for, from 
our families, from the 
concen tration camp. And also I have to make
 a -- how should I say, I diverse my jacket, 
you know, that striped jacket 
from concentration camp . I had th
at original striped jacket, 
and by many occasion, whether in a church or
 by many occasion, I wore that jacket, you 
know, when I had a speech, when
 -- when that was somethi
ng about the Holocaust. And 
when  I come in Washington, y
ou know, they tell me, 
make sure bring that jacket. So I did 
bring that jacket there. And you know, that 
was some kind -- I -- was hard to -- to give 
that jacket because you know,
 this was like a diverse you know? That jacket keep me 
warm, you know, there in concen tration camp , 
and I have to -- but I thought, on the other 
hand, okay, this is the right place for the 
jacket, you know, so the 
future generation can 
see what kind of a clothing you had. Ho w I 
was dressed up, see? Yeah, and th at was -- 
that was a little bit emotional. 

Q: Maybe you can speak a little b it more about
 the society that y
ou belonged to. Maybe 
you can say the name one more time, but also 
a little bit more about the work that you do. 
How many members, what -- what do you do -- 

A: Like for ins -- 

Q: -- what kind of work? 
A: -- like for instance, the -- th

r that purpose, we organize 
twice a year, sometime three tim
es a year, some kind of dancin
g, or -- or banquet so we 
get the mo ney for that purpose. This is wa 
-- wa -- one of the organization. The second 
one, I™m also co-founder, that was my idea Ko

this is an or-organization I am very proud ab

ordinary people. Bu t these are very high class 
organization, let™s put it this way. And they 

also gave me medal and I am there now hono
rable chairman of this organization. Then ,

des, you know, Chopin was Polish, you know, 
Maria Curie-Sklodowska, Paderewski was a 
good artist, and -- and General Kasimir 
Pulaski, and [indecipherable] 
for this country, and Genera
l Kasimir Pulask
i was wounded 
and died there in Georgia that time in the wa
r, you know, die for this
 country. They know 

a little bit, little bit a-ab
out that, see, but really th-that -- the more interesting was to the 
younger generation, here in this country , wh en
 Ho ly Father John Pa
ul the second become 
Holy Father as a pole -- Polish cardinal, then
 the people was more 
interested where he 
come from? Ah, he is Polish. What he was doi
ng during the war? Well,
 this and this, you 
know, and they -- then th ey -- they -- and that was interes
ting, I think, and they was more 
interesting, you know, to fi
nd out, you know, what -- what
 kind of a country is the 
Poland, you know? I speak gene
rally, you know [indecipherabl
e]. Then a se
cond, when a 
-- when a Co mmunist was -- we think was so
 strong and we thought, you know, nobody 
gonna fight Communist you know, and the Co mmunist gonna be forever, here a simp le 
co -- guy come from the Gdansk
, Lech Walesa, and he started that strike what was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 
 
 
 

 
73
impossible that time, y ou know
, in any Co mmunist country. He started it and he get 10 
million workers behind him. And this is very in
teresting, without the one shot to be fired, 
you know, he defeated the Co
mmunists, you know. Thanks 
to him, you know, and the 
Holy  Father was helping too, and I mu st say,
 that time, P resident 
Reagan help also, you 
know [indecipherable] like he call on Gorb ach
ev, come on, get down
 with the Berlin 
wall, come on, open the border, 
you know, and th is and this. 
That was President Reagan 
and he was the first president he called 
it by name, you know, he called the Communist, 
you know, devil, or wh atever 
he said, yeah. So this togeth
er, you know, of course they 
study in Poland, you know. Th
en that Poland was more inte
rested to the younger ge -- 
generation, you know, wh
ich is good to -- to know, these facts, yeah. 
Q: What -- what about your own children an d gr
andchildren? Are they -- to what dis -- to 

what degree are they interest
ed in their own si -- Polish 
and Austrian, for that matter, 
background? 
A: Yeah. To be honest with 
you, we not talk that much, yo
u know, about this, you know. 
I -- I don™t know, we never discussed this, re
ally, you know. We talk mo re about, you 
know, what happened, wh
at you doing, you know, and this
 and this, but we not go th ere. 
Once awhile we talk, you know
, how nice was in Austria, 
and around holiday s, you 
know, they got different style 
there for the holidays, you kn
ow, and also in Poland, you 
know, so we -- we talk the tradition a little 
bit, you know, but not too much. Maybe we 
should talk mo
re about that. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 
 
 
 

 
74
Q: I guess I was just wondering whether they 
themselves had sortof
 the urge to read 
books about it, or to fi
nd out, or to -- to go themselves, o r -- or not. 
A: Yeah, well, not -- really, I don™t know what to
 say, yeah, it™s -- it doesn ™t come to that, 
yeah. 
Q: Wh-W hen you lo ok back, wh at kind of im
pact -- I mean this 
is a very difficult, 
complex [indecipherable] question, but maybe 
you can speak a little b
it to it, when you 
look back , what kind of impact did your e
xperience during th e war 
have on you, for your 
life afterwards? 

A: That -- I -- say again, I -- I didn't get you, I --  
Q: What -- what -- what impact -- what -- what -- 

A: Impact was, yeah. 
Q: -- effect, what -- what -- what effect did 
those experien ces durin g the war have on you 
for your life afterwards? 
A: Oh, like I said before, you know, th
at tells me, you know, that life can be 
[indecipherable] different, see? And th at th
e life itself can be so miserable for many 
people, not only for me, for many people. And 
sometime, you know, I 
think why is it like 
that? Why -- why was it like that? What I 
did wrong, you know
? Why those people 
suffered so much, you know? Is 
that my guilt because I am Polish, is that a guilt because 
I™m Jewish ? We didn™t do nothi
ng wrong, just our nationality and that was a crime to 
them? You see, so you -- you think sometime, 
instead of world wh ere we live today, you 
know, is a -- is a -- is a -- is a honest, 
or sometime, how should I say, dishonest. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 
 
 
 

 
75
Especially you know, it bothers
 me because those people wa
s high ranking, you know, no 
matter what -- whether that was Communist syst
em, or fa -- fascism, or -- or -- or -- or 
now, democratic system, they was then hi
gh and they still high.
 Nothing happened -- 
actually, nothing happened to th em, you kno
w? What happened to regular, average 
people, they suffere
d the most, yeah.  

Q: Your own political sympathies, are they --
 to which direction -- wh-what -- what are 
you, politically speaking, more sympathetic to
 which party? Are you more of a Democrat 
-- 
A: Independent, Independent, I just vote, an
d Frieda is mo re a open Demo crat, you know, 
and I in position, you know, because I got the 
radio program and I got so many friends in 
both parties, you know? Even  in Green party,
 see? So, I decided to stay Independent, but 
when  it come to the votes, I look who runs fo
r that office, you know, would I like that 
guy. I listen careful, you know, then I wait, 
you know, which one -- 
which -- which one is 
better, you know? Then I vote re
gardless whether he™s Republican, Demo crat, or Green. 
Yeah, I go by th e person, see? Frieda goes 
strictly Demo crat, you know, my  wife, yeah. 
But also sometime, yeah, o-oh
, gosh, he™s a Republican, but
 he™s a good man, yeah, 
maybe I should vote for him. I says, that™s up 
to you, that™s up to you. Yeah, so, again, 
thanks God we live here in this beautiful co
untry, and lately now, you know, yesterday 
we find out that Governor Bush
 was elected the new presiden
t. We wish him very well. 
Too bad you got some winners, you got some 
losers. That was unusual, we™re waiting 35 
days after the election and fina
lly we find out who is the pr
esident fo r us, and I -- I hope, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 
 
 
 

 
76
you know, he gonna do good a
nd keep this country strong 
and demo cratic, you know -- 
I™m very, very proud, you know, 
to be citizens of this beautiful country, United States of 
America. God bless this country . 

Q: Maybe -- I have maybe one more question 
for you. And maybe you™ll have nothing to  
say, but is there any particular event that
 happened, a political event, or a social 
movement or anything, over the last 50 years 
here, that had a special impact, a special 
effect on you that was sort of important to you for some reason? 
A: Well, when at that time, you know, wh at
 a -- what was it, 1962, when  John Kennedy 
was shot, you know, the president, you know, 
that makes a big impact on me, you know. 
I-I think on all of us, see, because that 
shouldn™t happen , you know. That was a big 

impact, you know, and I feel so
 sorry, you know, that happen
ed. Otherwise, some other -- 
I no see anything special besides. I can™t rememb er. 

Q: Well, I have one mo re question after all.
 Do you have a busy so
cial life? Do you see 
people, do you go out, are you 
busy in the community, apar
t from your work  with the 
society, are you -- 
A: Oh yes, yes, we had so many meeti
ngs, by gosh, you know, almo st every week  
meeting, you know. So in the evening I like 
to go fo r a meeting, 
you know, and discuss 
this, whatever they go
t in the program you know, and I™m pretty active. Which is good 
because you meet the people 
and you work for them, and th
ey do good job, and -- and 
this is a free country, you 
know, and you can -- you can do 
-- so long, you know, you no 
do anything wrong, you know, against the gove
rn ment, you know. And this is good, I like 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 
 
 
 

 
77
that part and this very interesting to me, a
nd I want to keep myself busy, you know, I -- I 
like to do. Matter of fact, you know, after we fi
nish this interview, we got a meeting at 
the Polish co mmunity club toda -- tonight, and 
we gonna elect a new officer, yeah. So we 
gonna vote, you know, that give me anothe
r privilege you know, 
to -- to select, you 
know, more officers, see? And is a pretty good or
ganization. Actually th
is is a -- to Polish 
community club belo ngs about 28 organization,
 different organization are shareholder, 
and we are shareholder, too. A
nd I on a board of directors, se
e? So, this is a very strong 
organization, we got the beautiful club. I was 
president once for three years, I remodeled 
that place inside, installed th
e air conditioner, and you know
, new ceiling, new floor and 
new walls, and there™s many, and by many oc
casion you got weddings
 and banquets, and 
we can handle about 300 people, and there™s a 
beautiful -- this a old building, but inside 
is beautiful atmo sphere, you know, remodel ev
erything. Thanks to me, I should say. No, I 
overdo it. But I was the president, and that
 was my suggestion to remodel that place, 
because that was a old style, you know, an
d now th e younger people, when th ey get 
married, you know, they  want to go in a dece
nt place, you know, have a wedding, you 
know, because they make a picture, you know
, and this and this. So I thought that™s a 
[indecipherable] time, you know, to remodel 
this place. No air conditioner, there was no 
air conditioner, oh, got to be. So I installe
d two air condition there. And it is a place 
where, you know, what -- that
 people can go. Not only Po lis
h people, but also, you know, 
Americans, you know. And is -- I™m 
very proud I belong there, yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 
 
 
 

 
78
Q: Well, on that positive note, let me thank y
ou very much for giving
 the interview, for 
doing th is. And -- 
A: You™re welcome, you™re welcome. 

Q: And this concludes the United States Ho
locaust Memorial Museum interview with 
Julian Noga. This is tape 
number three, side B. 
End of Tape Three, Side B 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 
 
 
 

 
79
Beginning Tape Four, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of a United States
 Holocaust Memorial Mu
seum interview with 
Julian Noga. This is an addition to 
the interview conducted on December 14
th
, 2000. 
Today is the 15
th
 of December. Th-This is tape numbe
r one, side A. When I thought 
about the interview yesterday, I thought that
 maybe we can go over one mo re time about 
the various organizations that you are -- 
A: Mm-hm. 

Q: -- have been working 
for, for the course of your life in
 America. Just to clarify a little 
bit, and maybe speak in a little bit more detail about th em. 

A: Okay . 

Q: So th e very first organization that 
you founded or joined was what and wh en? 
A: That was a short after we ca -- we came to
 this country . There was many others -- s -- 
people come from Germany, Austria, Italy,
 England, so called displace -- displaced 
persons. And we thought that time that we ne
ed an organization, we should be organize. 
You know, work  together, help each other, an
d so -- and so we or -- organize, I am the 
co-founder of Wh ite Eagle Association here in Utica, New York. And this is an 
organization, a charity organization like I said 
yesterday and ex ists al
ready 50 years. We 
just celebrated 50 anniversary of founding that 
organization. And that 
organization is also 
a me mb er of Polish American Congress. 

Q: Let™s -- let™s talk about the White Eagle a 
little bit more. What kind of causes did you 
support, and how did 
you get money together to support them? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 
 
 
 

 
80
A: Well, you see, after the war -- oh -- oh, afte
r the war was ended, there™s -- there was so 
many widowers, so many invalid
s, you know, people unable 
to work. And we organize 
some doings, some banquets and shows, and co
llect some money, and we helped those 
people. And also we help some children,
 you know, the orphans. And -- and stick 
together, and -- and also w-wo rk  togeth er to -- not
 to be lost in this 
big country, as it is, 
United States, see? And I think we did a good jo
b, and I was president for 35 years in that 
organization, I™m very proud, and this is a 
very well known, fine organization -- charity 
organization.  
Q: And that was a local -- that was a 
local effort here from -- from Utica? 
A: Yes, local, but also we got delegate
s to the Polish American congress. Polish 
American congress is national-wide organi
zation connected with 
the Polish American 
alliance organization, what is a -- a very bi
g, more like a insurance organization. Matter 
of fact, we had insu rance, many of us. We ha
d insurance, life insura nce, yeah, from th -- 
from this organization. And we
 got one president from both
 Polish American alliance, 
and Polish American congress. Th
is is one president, a very fine man. I had a ch ance to 
talk to him. He was our honorab le guest in 
White Eagle Association 
when we celebrate a 
year ago our 50 annivers
ary. Matter of fact, I was sitting next to him, and I show him my 
indentity card from American Holocaust, you 
know, United States Holocaust, and he was 
very interested. And then I had a interview 
with him after, and also I put on my  radio 
program. That interview was very interes
ting. Now, Polish American congress have 
lobby in  Washington, D.C., and Po lish Ameri
can congress was workin
g hard so that -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 
 
 
 

 
81
that Poland become a mem -- 
member of NATO organization. And now still the Polish 
American congress work hard to
 help somehow, that the Po
land be a memb er of United 
Europe, what is very important. And also, 
the Po lish American congress had a -- a -- 
many people in different way financially as 
-- for the needy peop
le, you know? And I 
understand that I am d elegate there, I re
present the Po lish home [indecipherable] from 
Utica. I -- I am the delegate to the cong
ress and our meetings usually we have in 
Schenectady, New York , Albany, New York, 
or even here in U
tica, you know? We 
discussed many problems as Polish Americans, wh
at is good for us, what is bad for us. 
Our meetings are very interesting, what we
 really work hard. So, because between us, 
Polish people from the past, fro
m the second World War, there is so me differences 
between our Polish -- Polish Amer
ican people in between, and Jewish people. Now, s-so 
what we do, many times we invite Jewish 
rabbis, professors, and we try dialog, and 
smooth out some of those ma tters a-a-ar
e not clear, you know, or some of those 
accusations sometime, they are 
not right, they are wrong. So
 we try and work together 
because Jewish people and Polis
h people go through the hell,
 through the second World 
War, and we should understand each other be
tter, and -- and help each  other, you know, 
in a many -- when you -- so
-called political matters. 
Q: So when you -- and so y
ou do seminars where you in vite Polish amer -- Polish people 
-- Polish Americans a nd Jewish
 Americans to -- to enter 
into a dialog about certain 
subject matters? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 
 
 
 

 
82
A: Yes, like we have meeting and we invite
, like I said, the -- some
 rabbis, some je -- 
from the Jewish organization leaders, professors
. In one of the meeting we had, oh, a few 
years back, I never forget that
 little bit -- was little bit touchy, 
I disagree little bit with that 
-- one of the speech, had one professor from 
Schenectady University, he was a young, 
Jewish professor, 35 years old, something 
like that. He make a questions, how come 
during th e war the Polish people, they had to
 save mo re Jewish people? And th at was a 
very touchy question. Then , al
so, that was that one survivo
r, I believe his name was Steve 
Stone, I believe, yeah. He wa
s hiding by Christian family du
ring the war, he was five 
years old. And he listened to th is conversati
on and when  everybody finished  talk, then he 
get up and he says, Professor, you tell us th
at the Polish people should had more and 
saved mo re Jewish people. Did you ever was 
in Poland, did you ever know mo re about 
that situation what it was during the -- during 
the war? He says no. He says, you just -- 
how did you find out about th
at, and how -- how you are -- well, I th ink that™s what I 
hear, that™s what we talk, you 
know, and this and this. He says -- th en he said, Professor, 
you know th at the Poland was only country  u
nder the German occupation for helping the 
Jews, for sa ving the Jews, was death sentence 
for that. Oh, he didn™t know what to say. 
He says, yeah but anyway, how  come Holland save percenta
ge-wise more Jew ish people 
than Poland? Then 
this Steve, the Jewish 
fellow, he says, well, percentage, that was a 
different situation and th ere is a difference
 between Ho lland and Poland. See, in Poland 
that was -- before the war star
ted, that was three and a half
 million Jewish people living. 
Okay, Poland is Christian country. The German
 know that. And the German expect that 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 
 
 
 

 
83
the Polish people gonna help Jewish people. 
And that™s why they set that law, for 
anything to do with the Jewish people, Po lis
h Christian help Jewish people or hiding 
Jewish people, death sentence. And th at wa
s the -- the poster was all over the city, you 
know, in Po lish and in German, you know, and th at was clear, you know, what you™re 
going to  get. But even so, this 
Steve -- this is not my words, 
this Steve told that professor 
from Schenectady, New York, even so, the 
Po lish people save about 100,000 Jewish 
people. Yeah. And different -- different ways
, see, some church es, you know, help lots, 
you know. The nuns, and also
 there was like Professor Karski. Professor Karski, who 
knows how many indentity card he give to th e Jewish people as a Christian. And those 
people survived. So I think that was a good an
swer to this. I™m sorry
 to say, you know, 
that the Jewish people maybe feel bitter agains
t the Polish people, th
at the Polish people 
make -- didn™t make enough, you know? But when
 you go to Israel, wh
en you look at it, 
what™s the name that place, you know, where th
at -- all n ames are, and th ey have -- had -- 
Q: Yad -- Yad Vash em? 

A: Yeah. 
Q: Yad Vashem, the memorial. 
A: Yeah, that™s right. You see so many Polish 
names, and so  many trees was planted, you 
know, to honor those people, saved Jewish peopl
e, and I™m so glad -- I™m so glad that -- 
that so many, at least so many was saved. Even
 so, you risk your life, but you save. If you 
save only one life, this is good, you know, 
but they save quite -- quite a few thous -- a 
few thousand, hundred thousand like 
that Steve se -- did say. So this is -- this is -- I wish -

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 
 
 
 

 
84
- I wish -- my wish is -- and I work hard, 
you know, and -- and I wish -- so this come 
true, that more understanding co me in betwee
n Po lish and Jewish pe
ople. We understand 
what they  go thro ugh. They
 go thro ugh the hell, and we was the next, you -- we go 
through the hell. Maybe in -- not in so -- 
s -- same degree, you know, but we was not 
mu ch better than Jewish people, you know th
at, when  we give you interview about my  
wife, Frieda and myself. I come t -- we co
me to the concentration camp, for what? 
Because we love each other? Why Jewish pe
ople come in a concentration camp? Because 
they was Jewish, yeah. Was th
at crime? There was no crime. They didn™t do nothing 
wrong. They  was people like 
anybody else, see? And th at 
bothers me . Now, how about 
Gypsy, Roman, let™s say. They come, so 
many of them to the concentration camp, 
because they was Gypsy, because 
they was Roman, right? All met -- 
Q: [indecipherable] 

A: All same with other religions, like 
how you say, people [indecipherable] 
Q: Jehovah Witness? [indecipherable] 

A: Jehovah Witnesses, right. Because they wa
s Jehovah Witness, was that crime? Or how 
about homosexual? How many 
homo sexual was there? They  didn™t do nothing wrong, 
you know, that wel -- that was 
for then -- even in this count
ry now, this is a private 
matter, you know, between person and person
, you know? And that -- that -- I no see any 
crime. So you see, when you 
-- when you go through this as
 a -- as a ex-concentration 
camp prisoner, I had so many Jewish friends. I 
eat with the same sp
oon, we help each 
other all we can. And when I hear such 
accusation now from the Jewish side, it hurts. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 
 
 
 

 
85
Because if you say that Polish people are an
ti-Semitic, that means I 
am anti-Semitic too. 
And I am not. I swear I am not, see, because 
I grow up with the Jewish people, I like 
Jewish people. They didn™t do 
noth ing wrong to me, and I have no reason to be against 
the Jewish people. 
Q: D-Do you feel that sometimes it is al
so a question of Americans -- non-Jewish 
Americans maybe not having en ough info rma
tion to understand certain things? When -- 
when  you told people that yo
u were out o -- that you were in
 camp, for instance, did they  
immediately assume you were Jewish
, or did they understand that -- 
A: Yeah, many people -- many -- many people told 
me -- many people told me -- we talk, 

well, for instance in that coffee shop we meet
, you know, and so we have conversation. 
They say, ooh, what wa -- Julie, w h at was 
you doing during the wa
r, where were you? 
Well, I was in Germany, yeah, I spent almost
 four years in a concentration camp. Oh  
gosh, four years in a concen tration camp . Oh
, Julie, I didn™t know you are Jewish. No w, 

this is -- you know, make me -- sometime 
make me laugh, then so metime you know, it 
bothers me a little bit, see, because again, be
sides the Jewish people, there were so many 
other nationalities in a concentration camp 
and they su ffered just the same, you know, 
like Jewish people. 

Q: You -- you did -- you did tell your story once
 or twice in the -- in the newspaper. It 
was -- 

A: About three times, I think. 

Q: About three times. An
d it was [indecipherable] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 
 
 
 

 
86
A: Here™s the one of them hangs, you know,
 about three years ago fo r Valentine day, 
there was a -- on the front page -- page, there wa
s that article, you see that -- my  picture, I 
smile, Frieda, you k
now. They were -- 
Q: It shows -- it shows both of you arm in arm and -- 

A: Yeah -- 
Q: -- looking very sweet and -- 

A: -- but wh en you look at it above, you know
, when we se -- gl -- right after we get 
married, you know, see our picture, you see how
 good looking we were at that time? Oh, 
Frieda was a beautiful girl, yeah. 

Q: I want -- I want to -- 

A: And then -- and then we publicize, and 
we have so many response from people, you 
know, American -- even from 
younger generation, we was 
-- I was surprised that the 
younger generation was so in
terested. And you know, it is
 for the younger generation 
here in -- in this country , wh en you write 
story you was in a concen tration camp , about, 
because you™ve fallen in love -- fallen in love
 with a Austrian or German lady. So the 
young generation says, and for th
at they sent you to th e concen tration camp ? I says, not 
only that, they send me to th
e concentration camp, I -- in  a way I was lucky they send me 
to the concentration camp, but I can be hanged 
for that. No, they -- th
ey can™t believe it, 
you know. For wh at, for love? Because you l
ove someone you co me to the concentration 
camp? I says yes. You say that time change, 
you know, and here in 
this country you can 
marry whoever you want, you know, rega
rdless on the color sk
in, you know, on 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 
 
 
 

 
87
background, you know, that doesn™t matter. 
See, but that time, during the Hitler time, 
Hitler want to keep up the cl
ean race, you know, German r
ace, you know, no mix. But I 
no have to  tell you what happened after th
e war, you know, there was a big mix. 

Q: So that was sort of an example for 
comme nts from the younge
r generation. Did you 
receive -- give us a few more examples 
from -- maybe from the Po
lish community or 
from other people.  

A: M-Many of them, many of them, some  people sent us the article in case we need it and 

even the [indecipherable] la
dy, you know, she drop about 10 n-newspapers, you know. 
And there was a -- a -- a big reaction on this
, and even the state sen ator, you know, once 
he -- he wrote me a -- a beautiful letter, and 
he says, Julie, I know you for a long time, I 
didn™t know wh at you was going through. Oh , wh
at a interesting story, so and so. And wa 
-- that response was very, very -- in general 
was very good, but als -- and we had some 
telephone call, yeah, oh congratulation, yes, ye
s, specially the last one, and what we had 
three years ago on Saint Valentine day, they
 even call me on the station that time and 
congratulate me. But also when  I get home 
after the program, you know, I had a nasty 
telephone, I told you that. A guy call me, he 
says, hey, you was in a concentration camp , 

Mr. Noga. I says yes. Oh, and then  you surviv
e. I saw your picture in that paper, this 
mo rning™s paper. You look go
od. You was probably th e -- one
 of the collaborator with 
the Germans, right? You know how this [i
ndecipherable]. I says, buddy, whoever you 
are, you are so wrong, and I got no wo rds fo
r you, good-bye. Then  I hang up. You know? 
You got people -- all depends, you know that. 
People are very funny, some people. Right

away they  accuse you for something. If I was collaborator with the Germans, you th ink I 
go United States Holocaust there in Washingt
on and tell my  story, and my  name, I didn™t 
change my name, my father and my brothe
rs, you know, still were
 living -- was living 
here, you know? I put my name if I was doi
ng something wrong? 
Absolutely not. And 
before they accept me in -- in
 United States Holocaust -- 
Q: Museum. 
A: -- before they invite me
, they check up my background
. They know who I am, yeah. 
So, you see, here is -- so again, when I co
me to the Polish people
 and Jewish people, I 
wish we get some mo re dialogs, we get to
gether, we smooth out some differences, you 
know. And be friends, you know
, as we was before the war 
started, you know, I had so 
many friends, I still got so many friends there,
 Jewish friends, yeah. And again, nobody 
can take away anything from Jewish people, 
wh at they was going 
through, through the 
second World War. They had not mu ch help
. I wonder sometime how come American 
Jewish didn™t help that time. When Profe
ssor Karski come and speak to the Roosevelt 
and tell him, Mr. President, in Warsaw, in Pola
nd, the Jewish people 
are -- they are killed 
by Germans, they sent to 
the concentration camp. You 
know what the President 
Roosevelt did say at that time? Well, after th
e war is finish, we take care of those war 
criminals. And that was -- yeah
. And that time he come -- Professor Karski come with a 
Jewish leader from th
e -- from Poland, from the Jewish 
underground. His name was, I 
believe Ziegenbalg -- Ziegenbalg, somethin
g like that. And th ey go to the English 
government, they go to the American govern
ment and nothing help that time, nothing 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 
 
 
 

 
89
help. So the -- Ziegenbalg, he commit suicide.
 He open  a -- I understand he open a gas in 
the kitchen, then he died, beca
use he couldn™t -- he couldn™t 
do anything to help Jewish 
people, you know? And this is 
a tragedy, see, that -- that 
the whole wo rld that time, no 
want to listen about this tragedy, what™s happ
en to Jewish people, what they  was doing in  
Poland, you know? And th at bothers me, you see. 
And that -- this -- this what I can say, I 
wish, you know, we -- we smooth out those di
fferences, if this exist any differences 
between Polish and Jewish people, so there™
s mo re understanding, 
you know, why, why 
and why, yeah.  
Q: I would like to stop for just one second, an
d -- okay, so we -- I have one last question 
left, and -- and that has to do -- there is anot
her organization that you have wo rked fo r, or 
that you actually founded, and th at
 was the Kopern ik Society, right? 
A: Right, right. 

Q: Yeah, when -- when -- wh
en  did that happen and -- a
nd -- and why Kopernik ? You -- 
what is the -- your interest there? Or wh
at is your mission of that organization? 
A: I was -- that time I was the president of
 Po lish community  club here in Utica, and 
under the -- my jurisdiction, there was 28 Poli
sh organizations, see? So otherwise, each 
meeting I speak to delegates of 28 organizati
on, see that Polonia in Utica. That time was 
very strong and still is strong.
 So, most of the -- those orga
nization was like a insurance, 
like a ro -- mo thers of rosaries, or Saint A
nne Societies, and Sain
t Peter Societies, you 
know. But I was looking around and I was 
thinking, gosh, you know, we need a 
organization, you know, on a little bit higher
 -- higher level. Tell us about the culture, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0066 
 
 
 

 
90
Polish culture, American cultu
re, you know? So that was a 
-- at that time, 1970 some -- 
yeah, that -- ™73, I think. That was a -- a 
fi -- fifth anniversar
y -- 500 anniversary of 
Nicholas Kopern icus -- Nikolai Kopern ik birt
hday. And th en I called special meeting, the 
whole Po lonia meeting, and it -- oh, about hu
ndred  people attend, presidents, you know, 
from different organization, you know, guests
. And I introduce my plan, you know, we -- 
we need another organization. And because 
th is is a 500 anniversary of Nicholas 
Kopernicus, Nikolai Kopern ik bi
rthday, maybe we should build
 up a statue, put the statue 
here in the city [indecipherable] to this -- 
ma ke a mark, you know, 
to this, because who 
was Nikolai Kopernik? Nikolai Kopern ik wa
s the astronomer, and he was the first man 
find out that the -- not the sun but the earth tu
rns around the sun, right? Yeah, and that -- 
that came long time til his b
ook and theory was accepted, 
but finally was accepted, and 
by gosh, truth is, we can send a man on the m
oon, do you know, and 
th is and this, you 
know, that [indecipherable]. 
And so the people agree to -- to do th is, and wa -- coming 

back to Nicholas Kopernik -- 
Ko -Kopernicu s, he is a universal man. And I think that -- 
that time I thought -- I thought that was wort
h [indecipherable] to bu
ild up th e statue for 
him. And we did. I designed th e pedestal, 
because I am stonecutter, of course, and the 

statue was made -- three and a half meter hi
gh, was made in Warsaw, in Poland. Bronze 
statue, made out of bronze. So
 we put it together, and -- that
 statue, with the pedestal 
base, is 21 feet tall and four inch es, exactly
. And th en -- then we had unveiling. When  the 
statue was ready we had unveiling and ma
ny, many people come. And the congressman 
make a -- a -- recorded it in Wa
shington, D.C. in Congress, th
at such a thing happen in

Utica, New York . And that was a big -- big,
 big thing. So -- and the organization, 
Kopernik  organization, right after that decide
d to give a -- help students in college, you 
know, give a grant, you know, give a scholarsh
ip. And that™s what th
ey do since that, up 
to today, you know, they do -- not big sc-s
cholarship , you -- like thousand dollars for 
three s -- fo r three students, each become t
housand dollars -- get a 
th ousand dollars, yeah. 
And that organization -- yes, the organizatio
n got the -- got the museum and they™ll find 
work for this community.
