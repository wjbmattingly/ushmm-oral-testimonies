A: Well, I think she came shortly before I was born, from 
Indonesia
, and started to 
work for my parents, and -- as a nanny

know very little about her. We
 didn™t know her age -- 
Q: Was she a young wo man though, when  she came? 
A: She was a young wo man, yeah, yeah
. An d she couldn™t speak the Dutch 
language, so we -- as a boy we -- I t-talked
 Malayan language with  her, but I forgot 
all about it -- well, not everything, but mo st of it. 
Q: So, as you say, growing up in 
your home you spoke two languages?

 school, I think? And that™s a 
seven grade school, and after that I went to

gymnasium
, and I finished that.

the -- in the -- almost the ce

1937, I think, to the center of the city,

and that was close to the street where my 
mother lived. But she us
ed to live also in 
the suburbs, first. 
Q: Mm-hm. And wh at kind of a neighborhood was it, was it pri-primarily 
Indonesian or Du tch? 
A: No, it was a Dutch neighborhood. 
There were not too many In -Indonesian 
families in -- in -- in those 
days. Only the people that 
worked in the restaurants. 
There were the -- well, you have to divide 
the Indonesian populatio
n in two, the real 
Indonesian people and the half Indonesian
 people that has also Dutch blood. And 
that was another kind of class.
 A nd we were, in fact, real Indonesian. My father was 

real Indonesian so the-there was a differenc
e. We didn™t have the Dutch nationality. 
They called it 
[indecipherable]
 I don™t know the word  
[indecipherable]
 subject, or 
s -- s -- I don™t know the English wo rds.  

Q: Okay . And your mother? 

A: My mother was completely
 Dutch, hundred percent. 
Q: So you were con -- you,
 the children, were considered  mixed Dutch Indonesian. 
A: Yeah, but we are not completely Indonesian and -- nor completely Dutch.

Q: Yeah. And is that considered in society 
above a hundred -- i-in 
that society at the 
time, in the 1930™s, was th
at half and half consider
ed above a hundred percent 
Indonesian? 
A: Yeah, that was considered
 ha -- above that, yeah. 
Q: In your neighborhood when  you were sm
all, did you know any Jewish children? 
A: Some. Th-They went to the same elemen
tary school as I. It was not a p -- the 
religious school, it just a school for ever
ybody. So there were a lot of Jewish 
children there, too. 

Q: Did you play with th em? 

A: Yeah, of course. We -- we didn™t make 
any difference b -- in those days. I -- they 
called me some names because I had the diffe
rent color. It neve
r really bothered me. 
Q: Why didn™t it bother you? 

A: Well, I saw it as a joke. I -- I remember
 I -- just after the war I went with two 
friends on a cycle tour in 
Holland, 
and we came in the middle of 
Holland
 with all 
farmer™s country . And well, I was -- when
 I went into the 
shops everybody was 
looking at me and I felt kind of 
proud. They saw I was different. 

Q: What are your first memori
es of hearing of a man named 
Hitler
? Do you -- I 
mean, you were born in 1931, he came into
 power in ™3 3, obviously you were too 
young. Do you -- can you reca

A: Well, maybe wh en  I was seven or eight, my  parents used to talk about
 Hitler
 and 
-- but they thought, well, maybe it will go over. 
Just a short time, it 
-- then 
when the 
war came, we knew who 
he was, and just -- 
Q: You™re talking ab out in September ™39? 
A: Well, then th-the war started with
 England
, when the -- the Germans invaded 
Poland
, but for us the -- the war started at the 10
th
 of May, 1940.  
Q: Yeah, that™s -- 
A: Then jer -- 
Q: -- wh-when they  invaded the 
Netherlands.
 For you, the war for you, right, right. 
Did you have any fear of this
 man before the -- before 19
40, in th e late 30™s and in 
1939, did you -- wh at was a child™s sense of 
Hitler
 at th at time? 
A: Not much, th -- we didn™t
 talk too much about it and I c -- I can™t recall that we 
talked about 
Hitler
. It started in 1940. 
Q: Okay. Did you -- just to g -- to go back
, and wh en you were in school you said 
you had Jewish friends; were there 
Jewish teachers at your school?

lived and my mother lived in the 
Zo utmanstraat
 with a z -- 
Z.
 
Q: Okay . All right, now it™s May 1940 and you are ni -- just -- almo st nine years old, 
close to nine. What is your ve
ry first memory of that time? 
A: Well, it was a -- kind of exciting because 
there were airplanes in the air and there 

were parachute -- parachutists droppings in 
The Hague
, German parachutists and 
we heard all gun sounds and -- so it was kind -- comp letely new for us and it was a 

beautiful day I can remember, w as lot of s
un. And I was standing with my  father in 

the garden in the 
van Kinsbergenstraat
 and I rememb er my asking my father, are 
we going to win this war? And then my fath
er said -- that  was his fa mous last words 

always, let™s hope so. And well, it was quite 
an -- it was a very short war, it so -- was 
only four days and we -- they
 -- we surrendered, or the 
du -- the Dutch surrendered 
because they thr
eatened to bomb 
Rotterdam
 and after that they still bombed 
Rotterdam
. So that was a short war, and -- but fo
r a child it was -- it -- it™s kind of a 
new experience and exciting. You didn™t re
ally -- really realize what the -- the 
consequences would be.  
Q: Do you have any ot
her recollection of those four d 
-- those first four days besides 
the -- the beginning of the days? 

 
Interview with Tolé Madna

A: Well, you didn™t notice too mu ch in 
The Ha gue
. There were -- there was some 
heavy fighting in th e country, but we di
dn't n o tice too much, there were -- there 
were no -- hardly bombings. 
Th-Th-The Dutch aircraft was wiped out in the -- the 
first day I think. So there was not much war in 
The Hague
. Right after that was the 
occu -- occupation. 
Q: And you continued to  go to school. 
So  let™s talk about the beginning of the 
occupation. Now, you™re liv
ing with your father and 
Mima Saina
 at the time, and 
the sisters are with your mo
ther. Okay, so, you™re -- you
™re -- continue to go to 
school? 

A: Yeah, we went to the school, I was -- it 
was 1940 so I was abou
t in the -- well, I 
went to school in 1937, so 
I was in the third grade, th
ird grade and everything went 
on normal. 

Q: What -- what about the summer of 1940, the -- the first summer? 

A: Well, we didn™t notice much, there was 
an distribution -- distribution of fo od and 
cigarettes and ev erything, but ev erything 
went well. There was no hunger in -- in 
those days and life went on.  

Q: Did you sense any nervousness among 
your Jewish friends at that time? 
A: They were still going to school, too, 
but I think til 1941, and 
then they were not 
allowed to school -- go to sc
hool any mo re. But there was 
one close friend, I forgot 

 
Interview with Tolé Madna  
 
April 18, 2002 
 

 
 
10
his name, and his mo ther was a close 
friend of my  mo ther, and he suddenly 
disappeared , and we never heard of them any 
more, they -- I don™t know if they went 
into hiding, or -- my mother 
didn™t hear from them, either. 
Q: Did you, as a child, question 
why a friend suddenly  disappears? 
A: Well, we really had -- we heard soon ab
out the -- that all kind of things against 
the -- the Jews were all n -- 
how do you call that, all -- 
Q: Restrictions? 
A: Yeah, restrictions, and as a child you 
didn™t think mu ch  of it. You didn™t quite 
understand what was happening. 
Q: What™s it like for a nine year old boy 
to see it -- a soldier in a German uniform? 
A: Well, the first soldiers -- 
the -- the German had that ki
nd of way to gi -- to try to 
get along with the Dutch, because we were
 the same  race, and they  want to be 
friendly with us. 

Q: Did you speak, or do you -- di
d you speak German at the time? 
A: At the time, no, no, no. 
But they th -- didn™t -- the 
-- the Dutch didn™t like that. 
The -- the Dutch were never ex
treme. So they™re always in
 the middle, and they  love 
th-the -- the queen and -- though there were 
a lot of people angry because she left for 
England.
 Later we heard she was forced to go
, she didn™t want to go. And so th ere 
was a lot of national feeling all of a sudden 
and the Germans didn™t like that at all, 

 
Interview with Tolé Madna  
 
April 18, 2002 
 

 
 
11
and then  they got mo re harsh against us, and -- but we didn™t notice mu ch 
concerning the food. Til 1944 ev erything went quite well. 

Q: In April of 1942 the Jews ha
d to start wearing a yellow star. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: What did that mean to yo
u, when you would see that? 

A: Well, it -- it was not th-the -- the -- 
what™s the word? Strange. W-We found it 
very strange that people has to walk lik
e that, you know? And that -- to become 
Jews, and I would -- I sho -- when I -- would 
have been a Jew, I would have refu sed 
to wear it. 

Q: Why? 
A: Well, it -- because it™s -- it -- it™s like a humiliation, you call it that? Like 
humiliation. And -- an-and it™s -- a-and it™s on
e of the worst things that can happen 
to a person, humiliation. But we
ll, you -- you got used to it,
 but I -- I had to kind of 
feel sorry for them. 
Q: You said, I think in 1941 I think the 
Jewish children had to leave the school? 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Where did they go, or wh at did you 
know about it and did you
 keep in contact 
with them? 

 
Interview with Tolé Madna  
 
April 18, 2002 
 

 
 
12
A: I don™t know. 
[indecipherable].
 I don™t know wh at happened to  them. The only 
family I know, the real family, were the
 Munzers
. And well, they were killed in -- 
were very young, not go
ing to school yet. 
Q: Okay , let™s talk about the 
Munzer s
 because you -- you knew th em before 
Alfred
 
came to your house. Ho w -- 
how did you know th em a
nd wh at was your contact 
with them? 
A: My mo th er moved to the
 Zo utmanstraat
 in 1938 and the 
Munzers 
were already 
living opposite. 
Alfred
 told me today it was number hu
ndred , and we lived on 79 in 
the other side. And my mother -- I™d -- I do
n™t know how my  mo ther met his mo ther, 
but I remember often go there, and to play 
some with the -- the little girls, and have 
dinner. 

Q: This is before 
Alfred
 was born? 
A: Before
 Alfred
 was born, yeah. So this was alr
eady 1938 - 19 - 1939 - 1940. And 
then things changed and I don™t know what
 was really happening
. My mother told 
me what was happening, that -- but that wa
s 1942 when they we
nt in-into hiding. 
Q: Now did you -- do you rememb er if you 
went to their house after ji -- ji -- the 

Germans invaded the
 Netherlands
? 
A: Yeah, yeah. Course, yeah. 

Q: You still went over to be with them? 

 
Interview with Tolé Madna  
 
April 18, 2002 
 

 
 
13
A: Yeah, we went to there, yeah, I can re
member that. And my father, his father was 
-- Alfred™s
 father was a tailor and my father 
bought a suit. So he knew ma -- M r.
 
Munzer
, to o. But I don™t recall to o many visits
 then. But it -- I think it went on and I 
-- I -- I really don™t know any more.  
Q: Why did you enj
oy going over there? 
A: Food. And I still have sugar in my sala
d. And I -- I first -- my mother always 
made th-the salad all -- very sour, and it™
s why -- why I still hate sour things. But she 
put sugar in it and I liked it very much. 
And she was very friendly, too. Very 
friendly lady. 

Q: All right, now let™s move
 onto the story about how
 Alfred
 came to your house. 
A: Well, the -- my mother was as
ked to find a hiding place for 
Alfred
, by his 
mother. And so she found a -- a place at my
 aunt™s, my  youngest aunt™s, the younger 

sister of my  mo ther. And he
 stayed there for a month. 
Q: All right, we™re talking about Sept
ember ™42, what are we -- what -- 
A: Something -- something like that, yeah, 
September ™42. Bu t he only stayed a 
month because one of the neighbors appear
ed to be a Dutch Nazi, so it was too 
dangerous. He -- he was crying a lot, he 
had bronchitis or some
thing, and -- as a 
baby, and he -- they had to move him. And I 
talked to my cousin just before I went 

to 
Wash ington, 
the daughter of my  aunt, and she 
told me that everybody was crying 

 
Interview with Tolé Madna  
 
April 18, 2002 
 

 
 
14
when  he had to leave, and was the first 
time she saw her father cry. And then my 
mother asked my father
 to have him for --
 Alfred
 for a couple of weeks. 
Q: How do you explain your mo ther and you
r aunt -- and of course la -- we™ll talk 
about your father later -- willingly taki
ng in a Jewish nine
 month old baby? 
A: Well, my mother always 
liked to help people, always
. She wanted to be a nurse 
all her life, but she came out of a big fam
ily and the father, my grandfather -- I -- I 
never met him -- forced them 
to work right away
, to have jobs an d shops and so she 
was not allowed to study fo r a nurse. But la
te r on, when she was 65, she started  to 
work as a nurse, though she 
th -- the -- for the money she didn™t have to do it, but 
just to help people. And I rememb er my mo
ther in those days, she was very agitated 
to -- really to help and wa
rn us, don™t tell an -- anyb
ody about this, and sh e was 
really taking care to try to find places fo
r Jewish people, but I don™t re -- remember 
if she did this for other Jewish people, to
o, I don™t know about 
that, but she did for 
Alfred
. So he stayed fo r -- well, that was the 
intention, to -- for a couple of weeks in 
our house. 
Q: So he comes to your -- he™s brought to 
your house, do you remember the day that 
he came? 

 
Interview with Tolé Madna  
 
April 18, 2002 
 

 
 
15
A: Yes, I rememb er that, yeah. Just a ti
ny baby. And blonde, bl
ue eyes. Didn™t look 
Jewish at all. And I think, in th e beginning,
 that was a luck, too. His Jewish fe atures 
he got later. But the three week
s became three and a half years. 
Q: So he comes, what was your first feel
ings when  this new baby is brought into  
your home? You -- you had seen -- had you
 seen him before, because where -- had 
you visited them in the last nine months? 

A: No, no, I didn™t visit them 
in the last months, but we we
re excited. It™s -- it was a 
kind of new thing happening, an d well,
 what can you say when  there™s a baby 
coming? So it was kind of exciting. 

Q: So it -- there was now your father, and 
Mima Saina
, your two sisters, you and 
the baby, four ch ildren. And how big a house did you have? 

A: Well, my sisters we re staying with 
my mother, but from tim
e to time I stay ed 
with my mother and they stay
ed with my father. And some
times th e three of us were 
together and -- and my sisters loved it. 
Well, it™s -- maybe females are more a-
affected to babies than men. But yeah, th
ey took care right away. And the house was 
not big.  

Q: Where did the baby sleep? 
A: The baby slept with 
Mima Saina
. 
Q: She had her own room? 

 
Interview with Tolé Madna  
 
April 18, 2002 
 

 
 
16
A: Yeah, she had the -- well, it w as not r
eally a -- it -- it was an extension of the 
house and there were several rooms connected
 to each other and she slept in one of 
the rooms and -- with -- with 
Alfred. 
Q: And so she obviously took care of 
him when he was very
 young i-i-in the 
beginning a
nd you conti
nued to go to school while this -- whe -- af -- you were still 
at school. 
A: Yes, I was sti ll at sc hool and everyt
hing went on normal 
til the end of 1944. 
Q: And as the baby got bigger, what 
happened with th e -- an-and was moving 
around, were there any restrictions? 

A: Well, he had to stay inside, and he wa
s looking through the ho
le where the -- the 
letters come in. And -- 

Q: Th-The mail -- you mean the mail slot in the door? 

A: Yeah, yeah. And he looked through that
, but he came in the garden, and he 
played in the house. 
Q: He went in the garden during  the day, when 
others could see? 
A: Yeah, because we have pictures made in
 the garden, so he 
went to the garden, 
too. But my father told 
everybody who -- who was curious about the baby th at he 
was a child of his former wife, so my 
mo ther. And -- but she had a new friend and 

 
Interview with Tolé Madna  
 
April 18, 2002 
 

 
 
17
he didn't want to have the baby, so he 
-- my father took th
e baby. That was the 
excuse. 
Q: And tell me how you as a young boy knew
 how to protect this
 child and not say 
anything wh en you were outside. How 
did your father present that to you? 
A: Well, there were warnings and we unde
rstood that quite good. Th-The -- when 
my  fath er an d  my  mo th er to ld
 me that if the Germans woul
d find out, that he would 
be arrested, my mother would be arrested
 and probably  we too, and brought to 
camps, or th -- imprisoned, or maybe shot. 
So  that was a warning enough, I think. 
Q: Did you know what it me ant at 11 year
s old to say you mi
ght be brought to 
camps? What does that mean 
to an 11 year old child? 
A: Well, we didn™t know ab out the camps th
en, but to be -- go in prison or to be 
shot, you realize that right aw
ay, that -- that -- it was not 
too difficult to realize that. 
And we kept our mouths shut, my sisters 
and me and all the people that knew ab out 
it, th -- a lo t of the Indonesian community, 
th-the people that worked in the same 
restaurant as my father, th
ey kind of knew about it. An
d -- but those people didn™t 
say anything, just helps. 

Q: Were you angry th at your father put you
 under this stress of not saying anything? 
A: No, no, because we felt th
 -- very soon quite strong for the baby. It was our -- our 
baby, and so we never had the -- th e probl
em. The only thing ma
ybe, it was for me a 

 
Interview with Tolé Madna  
 
April 18, 2002 
 

 
 
18
little bit difficult, is th at I came s
econd in place. I was the first, I w as
 Mima Saina™s 
baby and now 
Alfred
 was in the number one, I f -- I 
felt at the time, but she took 
great care of me too.  
Q: What did you call 
Alfred
? 
A: We called him 
Bobby
 and that is the name my father invented for him. And 
Bobby 
always thought it was the name of the 
dog, and as far I can remember, there 
was a dog named
 Bobby
, too, and there was a name -- a dog named 
Teddy
, but died 
already and -- but there was also a dog named 
Bobby
, so -- 
Q: These were dogs that -- that you had? 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Not neighbors, but you? 
A: Yeah. Just little dogs. Very friendly little dogs.

Bobby
, 
as you na -- as you called him, got older a-
and was moving around, you said he -- he 
-- some of the things he™d like to do would 
be to look through 
the mail slot in the 
door. Wh at else did he do during th e da
y as he got bigger and mo re physical?

A: Oh, he was playing all kind of games 
and I -- I -- I think he was a happy child. 
Laughing and we played with
 him and everybody to ok care. He likes to sit on my  
sisters™ laps and it was just a normal family life.  
Q: And what language did he s -- learn to speak? 
A: Dutch. Dutch language. With 
Mima Saina
 he spoke the Malayan language, and 
the sa -- I spoke with her Malayan. 
With my father we
 talked Dutch. 
Q: So he grew up bilingual al
so, like you and your sisters? 
A: Yeah. Correct. 

Q: Mm-hm. As he got bigger, di
d you feel more close to him? 
A: We always felt very close to him. We 
-- we all loved him very mu ch and so it -- 
it was such a normal situation in  the house 
to have him there, and we got used  to 
him very fast and he was our little baby brothe
r. It -- it w as very easy, I think. I don™t 
reme mb er an y  p r ob lems at  all.  

Q: But you never spoke of
 him to your friends? 
A: No, no. The headmaster of my  school 
knew something about it, he was a very 
nice man, and my  mo th er knew him very well,
 and he gave me always extra food for 
-- for
 Bo bby
. And 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: Were there any times when it -- it was 
dangerous, that you sensed a dangero us 
situation?

A: Well, not in the beginning. In th -- I to
ld you before, til 1944, everything went -- I 
only rememb er one day a -- a bomb  fell in 
The Hague
 and that was just a mi nor 
accident, I think an -- an English plane wa
nt to get rid of the last bomb. And it 
dropped not far from o u r hous
e in th-the -- in the neig
hborhood and I reme mber 
Mima
 saying th at took -- everybody was up and awak e and she took 
Bobby
 out of 
his bed an d took him on his lap, swaying 
him and start praying. And -- but that was 
an incident. We didn™t notic
e much from the war til ™44.  
Q: You didn™t notice much 
of the war in your -- in 
The Hague
, but were -- again, 
were you aware, or were you interested 
as a y o ungster of what was happening in 
other countries? Did you know wh at was happening? 
A: Well, we didn™t know about the Holocaust,
 but we had th-those legal papers that 
were sent by the resistance movements to people. 
Q: Talk a little bit about th -- 
you had papers, did you say? 
A: Yeah, we re-received letters an d papers from the resistance movement. They 
were brought to the houses ille
 -- silently or secretly, 
and we read about the real 
situation in the front. 
Q: Oh, these are newspapers, you mean? 
A: Well, yeah, kind of newspapers, just sm
all pages of paper that  informed us about 
the situation at the fronts. And of course we had th-the -- the newspapers with the 

 
Interview with Tolé Madna  
 
April 18, 2002 
 

 
 
21
ger -- the German news and the -- they ha
d -- they wer-were winning all the time. 
But I remember that in the war I al
ready had a -- an -- especially after 
D-Day
, I had 
a map of 
Europe
 and with a woolen thre-thread, is
 it called? And with pins I put on 
the front line and I knew all the names of 
the generals and -- and that was -- well, 
with the -- the illegal papers, I could see all 
-- they move there and they move there, 
and they  move there, and -- 
Q: What was on the radio? 
A: Well, al -- only the German 
news. It was, of course, forb
idden to have a radio, so 
it was a kind of a dist -- distribution system with only two local -- 
Q: Stations? 
A: -- statio ns. And -- but we -- we -- there 
were people that had the radio still, and 
were receiving messages from 
London
. So we were well in
formed about the war. 
Q: Did you ever see any Jews bein
g taken away on the streets in 
The Hague
? 
A: Luckily not. But we hear
d about that. And then we 
knew, yeah, well the -- well, 
the Germans had -- well, they were
 just put to -- to work in 
Germany
, so we didn™t 
think much of it, that they would be
 killed, we didn™t know about that. 
Q: Was your father involved in -- in any 
other resistance activities b esides doing the 
wonderful gesture of saving a Jewish child
? Was he involved in any other activities? 

 
Interview with Tolé Madna

A: No. He just went on work ing. He was not 
a man that looked -- lik
ed to take risks. 
He was a very peaceful man, and always s-sa
id well, don™t fight, and be quiet and so  
we were all surprised that he took this ri
sk. But yeah, I think he -- he thought that 
it™s a child that has to be he
lped, so we do it, not thinki
ng further. He knew about the 
dangers, of course. But he -- I think he 
was very optimistic, like we all were op-
optimistic that it would 
end right, you know? 
Q: Did -- again, did you know
 -- you did not know
 of any other fa
milies that were 
sheltering children? 
A: No, no, we didn™t
 know about that. 
Q: Did any of the Germans ever come to your house? 
A: Only  in the beginning of the 
war, there was a -- what you call a 
razzia
, and a -- a 
German -- German soldiers we
re going from door to door to find men to wo rk  in -- 
in 
Germany
.
 
And I rememb er one day in beginnin
g of 1945 that 
a German soldier 
was at the door, a very small German sold
ier. And he was from th-the air force, the 
ground personnel because the 
other Germans had to fight 
somewhere. And he asked 
for 
mann. 
Q: Which means? 
A: Men. 
Q: Men. 

 
Interview with Tolé Madna  
 
April 18, 2002 
 

 
 
23
A: Are there men in the house. But he just asked fo r 
mann
. And 
Mima  Sa ina
 an-
and I were at the door together and we l
ooked at each other very puzzled and didn™t 
understand, pretending not to
 understand and then he ga
ve up and went away . And 
my  neighbor, who was Indonesian too, was 
only -- we were the only Indonesians in 
the street, and he was picked
 up. But he came back the 
same evening, they didn™t 
want us. 
Q: Did your father provid
e for a hiding place for
 Bobby
 in  case -- you said there 
weren™t any problems, but in case there we
re problems, did he have a hiding place 

for him? 

A: Not really. There was the cellar, but if you go in th e cellar you could see him 
right away, it™s a -- not, not really. Of course
, h-he was put in the back room that if 
somebody would co me in a
nd found him, there were 
maybe some questions and 
well, then I think th e problems would start. 
Q: Well, that was going to be my  next
 question. What ab out wh en friends or 
neighbors knocked on your door or came in, 
and you didn™t know 
if they knew about 
the baby, what -- 

A: Well -- 
Q: -- how did -- how did your family handle that? 

 
Interview with Tolé Madna  
 
April 18, 2002 
 

 
 
24
A: -- well, th-th-th-th -- I told you about 
the excuse my  father had, who the baby 
was, and that™s wh -- the story that he told
 the other people. But some of them knew, 
especially the Indonesian co-community, and 
-- but there were visitors in the house, 
yes. 

Q: And -- and th e baby, or the young ch ild was playing right in front of them? 

A: Yeah. He was in there at 
-- when the people came in. 
Q: And the general living conditions
, wa -- how was the food supply? 
A: Til September 1944, til the railroad stri
ke -- then the Dutch started the railroad 
strike to -- to make it difficult for the Ge
rmans to bring all the tanks and all the 
weapons to certain parts, then it went ba
d. And we -- then the -- what we call the 
hunger winter -- the winter of
 the hunger started and last
ed about -- well, started in 
October til May. 
Q: This is ™44 - ™45? 

A: Yeah. And it was a very severe winter, 
very cold, and I rem-
r eme mb er th ere was 
a small wood in  the -- in the neighborhood
 and wh en th e war was over there was no 
wood any more, because all the 
people cut th-the trees in to -- to have heating and to 
-- able to cook something, or -- so th
-the whole little wood fo rest went away. 
Q: What kind of food 
did you have during 
that difficult time? 
A: Very bad bread, very bad. 
And just -- I ca -- I remember 
I had four slices of bread 

 
Interview with Tolé Madna  
 
April 18, 2002 
 

 
 
25
a day, and that was all. And that finally be
came two slices of bread a day, no butter. 
There were some -- how do you call it?
 I don™t know the word s. We say 
[indecipherable]
, that™s when you replace something 
that it™s not real, like milk wi -
- 
Q: A sub-substitution? 

A: Yes, the substitute. 

Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And there was no sugar, there was no milk. 
Q: Any meat? 

A: No, no meat any more. In the begi
nning of 50 -- ™45, no meat at all. 
Q: Ve-Vegetables or fruit? 

A: Hardly. But there were those what we call 
haarkeukens,
 that were kitchens for 
the people and you went there every day to 
get some food, just 
with a little butter -- 
Q: R-Ra -- did you have 
a ration cards? Did you have
 little coupons, little ration 
cards for food? 

A: The whole war. But at the end of the 
war you had those cards
, but you couldn™t 
get anything.  
Q: Mm. 

 
Interview with Tolé Madna  
 
April 18, 2002 
 

 
 
26
A: So it was -- and there was, o-of course
, a black market. Am 
a -- I remember my 
mo ther in ™45 went on 
the bicycle to -- from 
The Hague
 to
 Haarlem
. 
Haarlem
 is 
th e same n a me as 
Harlem
 and it™s about 45 miles, to 
get some food. She knew some 
people, and I remember th -- she came back
, but it was over eight
, and you were not 
allowed to -- to be on the streets after ei
ght, and so  we were very worried. And then 
she came at the door with a 
German soldier. He had stopped her and then she to ld 
him I ha -- had some food 
for my  children and he brou
ght her home. So she was 
very lucky. 
Q: Did your father have any contact with 
Alfred™s 
family during this time, once the 

baby was given to you all? Did -- did Mr. and Mrs. 
Munzer
 have any contact with 
him or your family? 

A: Well, th-the parents of 
Alfred
 went in -- into hiding too, 
first in the sike -- si -- si 
-- 
seekeeatris
 -- that -- 
psychiatrix
 house, but then they we
re caught and deported 
right away, so there was no -- 
Q: There was no -- 
A: -- more contact. 

Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. 
A: I never saw her in the house before
 the end of the war, in our house. 

 
Interview with Tolé Madna  
 
April 18, 2002 
 

 
 
27
Q: Mm-hm. Well, let™s -- let™s talk  about 
that now, the end of
 the war. How did you 
know it was the end of the war? 
A: Well, we had to wait til the war really ends
, and for us it was terr
ible to think that 
already in October the allied fo
rces were only 60 miles from 
The Hague
, but they 
didn™t come. And we are expe -- ek -- exp
ect them -- e-expecting them every day, 
you know, it -- but they couldn
™t cross the rivers without 
-- they had too many losses 
with soldiers when they  should have cro
ssed the rivers. It was heavy defended -- 
heavily defended by the Ge
rmans. So they decide 
to take the rest of 
Holland
 and  
just pass the -- th-the -- the places where 
were lived. So we we
re only liberated 
when the war was over, and I remember, I th
ink it was the fourth or third of May? 
Fourth om -- of May, I think,
 and people were running thr
ough the streets, the war is 
over. The Germans have surrendered and ev
erybody went on the street and nobody 
thought about the eight o™clock. And the 
Germans didn™t d-do anything. I rememb er 

myself the sixth of May that we were in th
e city, and the first English soldier we saw 
was driving a -- a mo torcycle and he even didn
™t have a gun, he had a pistol, I think. 
And on the other side the street, the Ge
rmans soldiers were 
on bicy cles, heavily 
armed, because th-the allies said you have to
 take care of the situation til we come, 
but don™t do anything. So it was very funny 
to see this English so ldier, we were all 
around him, and see these German soldiers at
 the o-other side of street. And then it 

 
Interview with Tolé Madna  
 
April 18, 2002 
 

 
 
28
was over, it was over. And nobody thought 
about hunger any more. The -- the 29
th
 
of Ap ril -- April, we had a wonderful bombing of 
The Hag u e
, food bombing. And 
th-those big flying 
[indecipherable]
 dropped food on some spots of 
The Hague
, so 
we were very -- we were very
 happy. And every time it is
 becoming end of April, I 
think of those days. It™s im
possible not to think of it. 
Q: Did you know German by that time? 

A: The only German family I kne
w was a family that fled from 
Germany
 in 93 -- 
™33. They  were comm unists,
 but not well -- very well 
known by the Germans in 
Holland
, so  they started t-t-to
 ma ke a living here in 
Holland
, and th ey knew about 
it. It was very good friend of my fathe
r, and they helped, b
ecause they -- as the 
German inoccupi -- occupied the 
Netherlands
, they had some extra things. So they 
helped with food and -- and he was a kind 
of guy who sold  medi
cines and all kind of 
herbs. I -- I -- I know he cured me from 
a disease with all kind of herbs. 
Q: Di-Did you know th e Ge
rman language by then, af
ter being occupied  by the 
Germans? 
A: Just a little because th-tha
t -- in 1944 I went to the hi
gh school, though in the first 
year of high school it was only one mont
h, September and then  we didn™t go to 
school any more, til th e end of the war. 
So and -- and German was one of the 

 
Interview with Tolé Madna  
 
April 18, 2002 
 

 
 
29
language you had to  do. Also
 the English language was 
still taught. English, French, 
German were the languages. So I learned some German. 
Q: Whe-When -- during the 
occu pation wh en you were on
 the street and you saw a 
German soldier, did you have to acknowle
dge him? Was there anything you -- that 
you were required to do, or could 
you just walk b -- right by him? 
A: No, the -- my wife had the diffe
rent situation, she was in the 
Indonesia 
with the 
Japanese and you had to
 bow. But th-that was not the -- here, no. 
Q: So you could just walk right by? 

A: You cus -- you could just walk right by, 
yeah. But they  stole your bicycle. My 

father went out with  my  bicycle because his -- his bicycle was -- th-the Germans 
stopped him and they took you
r bicycle. And then he took
 my  bicycle and he came 
home without the bicycle. So we had an  ex 
-- the expression, the joke to -- we can 
hardly  stop to say to a Germ
an, I want my bicycle back. 
Q: You™re still waiting for your bicycle. 

A: Yes, I™m still waiting. 
Q: So now it™s liberation,
 and then what -- what
 happened after that? 
A: Well, I remember 
Bobby 
going on the street for 
the first time with 
Mima Saina
 
and wearing a light brown coat
. I still see -- I can still pi
cture. And with a Turkish 
[indecipherable]
 on his hat, and an orange sa
sh around his wais
t. And hewas 

 
Interview with Tolé Madna  
 
April 18, 2002

walking just really straight up, and 
Mima
 very proud. It was -- it -- it means 
something now. 
Q: Was he excited or frightened to be in
 su ch a big open space 
after being confined 
in your house his whole life? 

A: No, it just -- when he was with 
Mima
, he was okay. So no, he -- he -- he an -- 
really enjoyed it, yeah. No, he was -- was nice.  

Q: Did you really feel free at that tim
e? Was it a different physical, emotional 
feeling once liberation occurred? 

A: I think it™s the biggest fe
el of freedom I ever had. Five years occupation is a lot, 
and -- especially in the last part w as a ve
ry hard one, and you were afraid. There 
were a lot of bombings in 
The Hague
 afterwards, an-and -- and the march of 1945 
was a happy bombing of the allied and they took the wrong spot. So a lot of ci-

citizens were killed. So the 
German propa
ganda tried to -- to ma
ke a thing out of it, 
but well, we accepted, and -- I saw the bo
mbing from the balcony of my mother™s 
house. It was a -- but we got used to it, because there were air raids every day. 

Started at eight o™clock in the morning, til fi
ve in the afternoon. But you get used to 

it, those things.  
Q: Did you feel like a very 
old 14 year old -- I think yo
u were something like 14 at 
the time. D id you f-feel like an older person? 

 
Interview with Tolé Madna  
 
April 18, 2002 
 

 
 
31
A: No. I was still a young boy, and my fath
er said to me, what will happen to you, 
you will always be a 
jungecha
. A 
jung echa
 means al ways be a young boy. And I 
felt young and not really older. 
I was very small. I starte
d to grow a little bit more 
between my  14
th
 and my  18
th 
. And -- 
Q: Mm-hm. I -- I -- I meant more emotiona
lly. I mean, you had 
lived through such 
difficult, difficult times that with that ma
t -- did that mature you, seeing wh at you 
saw and being in  danger? 
A: Of course, yo-you learn, but I didn™t 
feel too much differe
nt, only freed, and we 
were very happy about that. And -- and the 
excitement t-to -- well, there was a very 
strong national feeling at the time, and so
metimes not quite correct. What the allied 

did was okay and wh at the Germans did wa
s always bad. Later on, when  you learn 
about the situations that™s happened in th
e war, and all -- all the other things, then 
you change your opinion so metimes about 
making war. Later on, I -- I thought it™s 
ridiculous to fight such a war. Of course
, you had to because 
you are fighting some 
crazy people. But when I thought
 about the generals that wo
uld send the soldiers to a 
coast, knowing that they w
ill die, especially  first groups, and then I always ask 
myself, how ca -- how can you do that? Break 
up all kind of families just because 
there is a difference in opini
on in the world, you know, 
it -- it still is and I think it 
always will be.

Q: So now it™s the end of the 
war and how mu ch longer did 
Bobby  
stay with you? 
A: Excuse me. As I -- I recall, it -- it wa
s in 1946 that his -- in the beginning of 
1946, I think, that
 his mother and 
Bobby
 moved to another p -- 
Q: Wh-W h-When  did she come 
back, though, to the house?  
A: It was very soon after the war was over, because she met 
Mima
 and -- and she -- 
yeah, she was there already, and -- 
Q: De-Describe what her first app
earance at your house was like. 
A: Well, it -- it -- of co urse, I knew her and 
Mima
 knew her and everybody knew 
her, only
 Bo bby
 ju st didn™t know her. And so it wa
s kind of funny and well, she 
hugged th e child of course, but he didn™t 
want to have -- have anything to  do with 
her. He wa -- didn™t want to s
it on her lap and I think that 
it will be hard for a mother 
that -- then, I realize later, 
much later when I was olde
r, that it was hard for my 
mother that I preferred 
Mima
 to  her, you know, that -- that
 was very hard, I think. 
But he went -- went on very well, and I 
think they had a very good relationship. 
Q: So did -- did Mrs.
 Munzer
 move into  your house and stay there? 
A: Yeah, she stayed there a
nd til the -- the -- I think the 
beginning of 1946 she had 
the -- she slept in th
e middle room with 
Bobby
 and we slept at the back. And it was 
very nice to have her in the house. She wa
s a very friendly wo man, and a very wise 
woman, too. 

 
Interview with Tolé Madna  
 
April 18, 2002 
 

 
 
33
Q: And then  wh ere -- and then  she decided to  leave and -- after a few months, and 
where did she go? 

A: She went to a -- a block 
not too far from us in the 
Arch imedes 
flat, 
Archimedes
 
the -- the -- 

Q: Mm-hm. 

A: -- the 
[indeciphera ble]
 man, I think. And I didn™t go too often to there. I don™t 
know what -- what™s happening, but it was 
like we lived our own 
life from that time. 
Q: Were you sorry to see 
Bobby
 leave your house and move in with his mo ther? 
A: Yeah. I -- I did -- I reme mb er that we
 -- we all felt sorry, but we u-understood 
that it has to be and -- and well, I starte
d -- I was almo st 15 and -- and no -- 15 in 
1946, yeah, and I became 
a real trouble child th
en. Especially because
 Mima
 died in 
-- in -- just a few months after th
e war ended. She had the brain -- 
Q: Hemorrhage? 

A: Yeah. And well, my world collap
sed. I lost my mother, and -- and 
Bobby
 didn™t 
ro -- realize it fully, and his mother was ba
ck so it was co -- a kind of comp ensation 
for him. He did -- he didn™t know what d
eath was, and -- but he honored her very  
much, but he doesn™t remember h er quite we
ll. So i -- we were in -- yesterday we 
were talking about all -- many things and 
found new th ings, oh ye
s, that was that, 
and yeah.

34
Q: So
 Bobby 
and his mo ther stayed in your house after
 Mima
 died? 
A: Yeah, til the beginning of 19
46. My father remar-remarri
ed in 1946, and also his 
new wife and th e children that
 came had much contact with 
Bo bby
 and considered 
him as a brother, too. 
Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. And then 
I understand they moved to 
Belgium
 in the 19 fi -- 
sometime after that. 

A: First his mother i -- had a kind of store, 
selling all kind of th
ings that -- like little 
things, you know, like rings and th -- in 
The Hague
, too, and I visit her there, was 
there. And he came to my fa
ther with the bus. My father had moved to a other part 
of 
The Hague
. And I reme mb er him -- bringing him -- taking him to the bus. And I 
remember him, said I -- I want to give you
 some money. And I was young my self, in 
my  20™s, 21, I think. And so I gave him a 
gilder
, which was a lot money then. It™s 
about a half a dollar or something. And he 
said well, it™s not enough. So I gave him 
another 
gilder
 and another 
gilder
. And 
Bobby 
s-said thank you, 
thank you. And I 
always gave him too mu ch s-so that 
I hardly could th e train and go -- go to

Q: So you went back  to
 school after the war? 
A: Yeah, I went back to school and was no
t very successful because I was in music 
already and I liked to be a musician and no
t go to school. But 
my  mo th er too k  care 
that I finished the school. And I™m very than kful, because later on I studied 
mathematics and it wouldn™t be possible w
ithout that school. So
 in the meantime, 
and -- I was in music, too, an
d developed. So I became a pr
ofessional in ™52, after I 
finished my  school, and did th at for about 
nine years, eight years. But I -- I didn™t 
like the way of living, you had to go ab road . 
And I -- we married in -- in ™55, and we 
were very young, I was 24, and 
Astrid,
 my  wife was 22. And there was son already 
in the year after. And a lot of -- and a l
ong time when we played tennis tournaments 
they thought we were brothers. And I alwa
ys said to him that, you know why? You 
have a old face, I think.

Beginning Tape Two, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of the 
United Sta tes 
Holocaust Memorial Museum 
volunteer collection interview with 
Rob Madna
. This is tape number two, side
 A. 
And you were talking about after the war 
and your marriage. An-nd you had been a 
mu sician and w-were you 
playing or comp osing? Wh at were you doing as a 
mu sician in the beginning? 
A: I was playing. 
Q: What -- what instruments? 
A: Piano. Playing th e piano and I was self
 taught and started to have contracts 
already and went to 
Germany
, to 
Switzerland
 and 
Denmark
. In 1954, four month 
in 
Sweden
. So I had a l -- lot to do. But I didn
™t l-like the way of living and also, 
well, I was a fall blu -- full blood jazz mu
sici a n  and you have 
to play commercial 
mu -music, and en tertaining the people, I di
dn™t like it. So I decided I™ll go on with 
my  mu sical career, but I do something on th e si
de. And then when I s -- that™s -- and 
then I decided just st-st-star
t with mathematic study, because I always wanted  to be 
a teacher in the first place. And in fi -- ™59 
I -- 1960 I started to work in the school, 
h-high school, as a teacher. An
d I did that for 25 years. 
Q: A h -- a high school mathematics teacher? 

 
Interview with Tolé Madna  
 
April 18, 2002 
 

 
 
37
A: Yes. And for 25 years, and the last f
our years of those 25 years I was assistant 
director of the sc -- sch ool. We had one -- we call it a 
hector
 and we had five bi -- 
because it was a big school of 1700 people
 -- pupils, and we had five assistant
 
hectors. 
We call them 
conn hector
. And I didn™t apply fo r the job, they ask me for 
the job. I said well -- I was like my father, 
di-didn™t like to take risks, you know, but 
I learned a lot in those years. But during a
ll the years, I developed my  mu sic and did 
a lot of television, radio shows and made some records, and -- 
Q: This is playing th e piano? 
A: Playing the piano, yeah. And I started 
to write music because a friend of mine 
who was already in 
Holland
 a famous writer said, you sh
ould write. I said, I don™t 
know how. And he said, I k
now, but use your fantasy. A
nd so  I started to write and 
learning from other people and t-talking ab
out mu sic and learning and listening to  
music. And I learned very much of
 all the records we got from the 
States
. 
Astrid 
always liked
 Frank Sinatra
 mu ch, so we had a lot of 
Sinatra
 music with 
Nelson 
Riddle
 arrangements. And I learned a lot by how f -- the 
[indecipherable]
 leadings 
were going. And so I started to write, a
nd wrote for th-th-th-th -- a kind of jazz 
symp hony orchestra too, with violins. I ne
ver wrote for violin befo re, but the same 
friend said, use your imagination. So I star
ted to do that, til ™85 when I was offered a 
full time jo b at the 
Hilversum
 Conservatory, the jazz sch ool, jazz department. And I 

 
Interview with Tolé Madna

hesitated because I thought, well, is it wi
se to make your ho
bby your profession? 
But I did, and I™m still workin
g in school. It™s now the 
Amsterda m
 Conservatory, 
after the 
[in d ecipherable]
. And well, I™m still playing. I™m
 playing this year in July 
in the big festival in 
The Hague
, the 
North Sea
 Festival where a lot of American 
musicians come. So they invited me this ye
ar, too. And then I™m 71 years old, so I 
can™t complain. 
Q: And you have two children? 
A: I have tw o ch ildren, a son of 46 and a da
ughter of 43. I™m not a grandparent yet. 
Q: And their names? 
A: My son™s name is 
Arthur
 and my daughter™s name is 
Helen
. 
Q: Tell me about your 
father after the war. 
A: Well, my father contin
ued wor-working. He was a man who likes to work . The -- 
the only time he had off was Wednesd ay afte
rnoon and then the fa
mily gathered. My 
sisters came to my father™s house and we
 always had a kind of party, eating and 
have all kind of cakes and 
pastries and it was always a nice day. But then it -- it 
changed wh en he had a second marriage in 
1946 and the children grew up, th -- my  
half brother and two brothers and the half 
sister. And -- but I was in the house, and 
lucky for them because I was th-the guy w
ho took the discipline 
things. She couldn™t 
manage the children and my  father was always
 working, so i-if there was a problem, 

 
Interview with Tolé Madna  
 
April 18, 2002 
 

 
 
39
I was th-the big brother, I was fi -- 15 ye
ars older than my  youngest brother, I took 
care. And I still have contact with them. 
Q: Did you all talk about the war a lot after it was over? 
A: With my father, yeah. And well, my brot
hers and my -- my sisters, we talked a 
lot. We always have a -- a lot of memori
es when  we meet a
nd they bought books 
about 
The Hague
, who it was -- how 
The Ha gue
 was in the 30™s and beginning of 
40™s and then all kind of things. We t -- we 
talk about that, yeah. 
So there™s always -
- the war is a very important part of our 
life. Was -- we talk often about it, and we 
talk a lot about 
Bobby
, too, and --  
Q: What -- what relation did 
you have with  him at -- then
? He moved away with his 
mother to 
Belgium? 
A: Yeah, and th en I didn™t see him for a l
ong time. He had mo re contact then with 
the 
Madna
 -- the new 
Madna
 fa-family. And then he went to the
 Sta tes
, I heard 
about that, and it wasn't til ™73, I think, 
that we came in contact again. He was 
studying, he had to go in the army , he was 
in the air force, and -- and we heard about 
that. My father told -- but I didn™
t have direct contact with him. 
Q: So he stayed in lette
r contact with your father? 
A: Yeah, yeah. He informed 
my  father about everything. 
And then we start to meet 
again, he came over to 
Europe
 and we were very, very 
excited an-and there were -- 

 
Interview with Tolé Madna  
 
April 18, 2002 
 

 
 
40
there are many pictures of those days a
nd -- and -- and after that there was much 
mo re contact. And now we have really m- mu
ch contact the last -- last few years. 
Calling, and -- 
Q: Yeah. Just -- can you tell me a little b
it about your wife™s background, just 
generally who sh e is and -- and how she came  to 
Holland
. 
A: Well, the -- she came in 
Holland
 in 1950, she was born in 
Indo nesia
. And they 
were -- the family was isolated 
th -- in the street. They had 
-- didn™t have to go to the 
camp, but they couldn™t go anywhere. So th
e -- the house was their prison. And she -
- she brought the 
[indecipherable]
 and the Japanese 
[indecipherable]
. She™s from 
1933. So she -- she -- she liv
ed the war too, you know
, she knows about the war. 
And then  after that there was the period th
at th-the Indonesians took over and this 
was the worst period, even wo
rse than the Japanese period.
 So th ey came
 to -- they 
came to 
Holland. 
Those are all German family. Her name is 
Mueller
 and we have 
all kind of German name
s in the family, like 
Hess
 and 
Funk
 and 
Uchma n  
and 
Luther
. And well, I me -- I met her, I think she was three months here in 
Holland
 
when I met her in a jazz club. She didn™t 
want to go but her cousin said, let™s go. 
And there -- there™s where we met. And 
we stayed together from that day.  

 
Interview with Tolé Madna  
 
April 18, 2002 
 

 
 
41
Q: You had said that when you first 
became a mu sician you had traveled to 
Germany
. What was that like for you an
d what are your thoughts about 
Germ any
 
today? 
A: I remember one incident, I was working in 
Germany
 for the first time in 1953, in 
Colo gne
. And I remember I ate in the interm
ission. And we had a -- a -- the tough 
job. We started nine o™clock in the evenin
g, until five o™clock in the morning, for 23 
marks. That wa -- wa-wasn™t bad money 
in those days. And I remember that I 
woked up to see the night, because it was su
mmer. I went in with daylight and come 
out with daylight. So I went
 up to see the night. But I 
remember while eating in the 
intermission, there were 
two waiters talking about
 Hitler
. And that -- hm, I -- I think 
he will come back. And I got so angry, and 
then I said, and then
 we will definitely 
kill him. And they beco
me so afraid, because in those days, if I would have told the 
English authorities about them, they would ge
t in trouble. So they  quieted down and 
be-be-became like slaves, th
ey acted like slaves, you know. Didn™t dare to say 
anything wh e-wh en I was in the neighborho
od, but I remember th at made me very 
angry to hear that. And 
Co log n e
 was bombed heav ily, it wa
s ruins. I worked in 
Düsseldorf
, too. Bu t I kind of like 
Germany
. It™s a beautiful country. We always 
make the joke, it™s a pity there are so 
many Germans here. But you know, I -- I™m -- 
I™ve been teaching germ -- Germans since 1985 
at the conservatory and a lot of them 

 
Interview with Tolé Madna  
 
April 18, 2002

became my  good friends. And I know you 
can™t blame them. But still I -- I told 
about my attitude in the war, and I told them about the two sisters, 
Eva
 and 
Leah,
 of 
Alfred
 and told them about 
Alfred
 and they always feel very uncomfortable th -- 
when you talk about it. I 
said, I d on™t blame you, I blame that system. But -- 
Q: 
Al-Alfred
 lost his two sisters.  
A: Yeah. 
Q: Yeah. So you™re comfor
table when  you™re visiting 
Germa ny
? 
A: I feel comfortable, yeah, because it™s -- 
it -- it™s a beautiful country. Only when 
they raise the voice I™m getting angry. I ev
en  told a German student of mine who 
was raising his voice -- not against me but to
 somebody else, and said, I hate it when  
people raise their voice, and especially wh
en they™re German. And I told him why. 
Because if a German raises his voice, I se
e right away a uniform around his body, 
wa -- an 
SS. 
I said, I hate that. He
 said, oh, so sorry. 
Q: Do you think you are a di
fferent person today because 
what -- of what you lived 
through as a young -- as a -- as a child
, what you went through, the war, the 
sheltering of a child. Do you think that ha
s made you a different person than  if you 
hadn™t experienced those times? 
A: Oh, I™m sure. One thing is, 
for instance, I hate to spoil 
food and to take too much 
on the plate so that there™s something left. 
I hate that, because we were so hungry we 

 
Interview with Tolé Madna  
 
April 18, 2002 
 

 
 
43
even ate tulip bul-bulbs in -- in the -- in the last part of the war, because there was no 
other food. And they  didn™t taste bad. Tast
e il -- they™re kind of sweet, but I say s -- 
tell it to one of the people I met h ere, yeah
, they were talking about growing tulips. I 
said, oh yeah, you grow the tu
lips. We ate them. But, of course the -- I told you 
before that in -- especially 
in these times, the end of Ap
ril, beginning of May, the 
war comes back to you and th
e ar -- yeah, the memories. 
I think the war was -- yeah, 
a mi -- a major experience in my life. And I 
never want to -- to have that again in my 
life. If -- I was in the army myself and it wa
s -- I had to go ag ain in the army  in ™62 
just for a -- a few week
s, and then the ticu -- 
Cuba
 crisis came, so we were very 
[indecipherable]
 but luckily it didn™t -- it work
ed out well. But I think the 
experience -- you have to te
ll younger people about it because I always say, when 
you never had a toothache, yo
u don™t know -- you can™t talk about a toothache. And 
if you never experience war or hunger, you 
can™t just -- can™t ta
lk about it. But you 
can tell them the story that way that they
 kind of feel it, y ou know? Because there 
were a lot of young people said, can™t you 
forget that? I remember in -- though, a 
nice German musician was in the band I was 
playing in and he ca -- explained this -- 
the way to 
Germany
, we had a gig in 
Germany
, you know, in the -- understand the 
word gig? Because it™s an ki
nd of music -- musician expr
ession. And he said, oh it™s 
very close. I said, I know it was close, th
ey were pretty soon
 here, you know. And 

 
Interview with Tolé Madna  
 
April 18, 2002 
 

 
 
44
then he said, can™t you
 forget about it? I said, not my
 generation. You have to wait. 
So. 
Q: Are you more religious, less religious, 
not religious, wh atever, because of wh at 
you went through? 

A: I™m not religious. I don™t believe in relig
ious of people. There are so many rules. 
I can™t live by the rules. I can™t liv e by th
e ru les. Th-The only thing I think my  
religion is don™t hurt other people. Don™
t hurt them, and try to -- when you are 
getting along with people, you mu st see them
, you mu st listen to them. I me t a lot of 
people here and they  are very friendly, 
but they don™t listen to you. And I met, 
luckily a lot of people that listen. I was 
impressed by th-the Jewish community here. 
I saw the whole 
Ba r Mitzvah
, th-the -- the ceremony there and I was impressed by 
the belief of people have and -- but I don™t 
have that, I di -- can™t believe in things. 
Maybe I™m too much a mathematician. I-I da
 -- I need proof or something, but I 
believe in the -- I can understand why people
 want to go in religion if religion helps 
them to -- to make th -- to let them have
 good life and help them in other kind of 
things, I won™t oppose to th
at. It™s good, you know? But 
I think I don™t need it. I 
have a strong belief in -- in my self and to
 -- to look in the mirror constantly and 
make the necessary 
changements
 in the -- I have scars, I 
call them mental scars, of 
all the things I did to people I didn™t wa
nt to do. And th ey sometimes pop up, you 

 
Interview with Tolé Madna  
 
April 18, 2002 
 

 
 
45
know? All of a sudden, you sit in the car and 
[indecipherable]
 sorry, then they pop 
up. And I think that™s enough. And -- but I 
can live with that, but
 th -- I learned from 
that to -- to have friends. I™m not a 
real national feeling person. I think 
Holland
 is a 
great country and I™m very ha
ppy that I was born th ere. We
 have a good security, a 
good living there. But I hate to watch 
soccer and get excited,
 you know, for the 
national team. National feelings makes me -- 
I -- gets an awkward feeling of we are 
people -- people, and I have my  friends 
everywhere. An y kind of religion I don™t 
mind. And I don™t mind if they™re homosexual,
 or -- if th ey™re people and they are 

good people, they are my  friends. And th
at™s the way I want to live, and maybe 
that™s my religion. 
Q: I know th at you, when you are at th
e Holocaust Museum, and we saw that wall 
where people had saved, at the end of th
e exhibit where they list the rescuers, we 
talked about there were so many people from the 
Netherlands
 listed, column after 
column  after column  for such a sm
all country. Ho w do you explain that? 
A: I don™t know. I don™t know. I didn™t kn ow th at there were so many Du tch people 
involved. I thought th
ere was a complaint that we di
dn't do too much for the Jews. 
Moby -- maybe the people as a whole, but 
there was ma ybe the silent group that 
nobody talked a -- my 
father didn™t like to talk about 
it, that he was a kind of hero, 
you know, and he always, ah
, it™s nothing. You know? He didn't want to have a 

 
Interview with Tolé Madna  
 
April 18, 2002 
 

 
 
46
medal or something, you know, that™s -- you
 th -- he didn't think it important. And -- 
but there are probably more
 people like that, and well,
 the list shows it, Yeah. 
Q: Mm. Mm-hm. Were you affected by the visit to the museum? 
A: Well, a lot of things I saw already. I saw a lot of movies on the Discovery 
channel about 
Germ any
 and they still are 
going on and also the 
Holocaust or the -- 
the 
Hitler
 period, and I see them all and so I 
knew a lot about it already. And well, it 
always -- it -- it™s, when you look at it -- I 
really get angry if they deny it, that there 
was a -- a Holocaust in th -- in
 there. I think they are the 
greatest idiots to deny it. 
And -- but it doesn™t look real when you 
see all those corpses of those skinny 

people, you know, lying there. It -- it -- it -- 
it™s not real, it™s like that™s a drawing, 
you know, you don™t believe it.
 A nd the American soldiers
 when they came to the 
camps, they didn™t believe it e
ither. But this -- the -- wh-w
h-what kind of brain you -
- do you have to do this, you know? Maybe a 
lot of Germans, well 
they didn™t like to 
do it either, but they  had such a fear of not -- to become in -- the same prisoner, you 
know? Maybe. Bu t I think in that case you have to make a decision. I would refuse. I 
think I would refuse to do it. And maybe y
ou get killed, but I th -- I think I wouldn™t 
be able to live with 
the thought I didn't do anything, th
at this -- if you see this an d 
then you are th -- fello w sold
iers kill people and just 
shoot them, you know, and I 
can™t imagine that people can
 do that. I wouldn™t do it. 

 
Interview with Tolé Madna  
 
April 18, 2002

Q: You sound like you™ve inherited somethin
g from your father. How d -- just again, 
how do you explain his willingn
ess to put himself at risk and his children at risk, to 
save another person™s life? 
A: Well, it -- I told you befo
re, it surprised me that he 
did it. And th-though it was 
supposed  to be only three weeks and 
Mima Saina
 didn™t want him to go, 
Alfred
, so 
he agreed. He is th -- he is the boss of 
the family, but he agr
eed, you know, so he 
must have felt a lot for the ch
ild, too. And well, decided to
 do it. I -- I can™t explain 
it, my self. But he was a peaceful man. 
I don™t think -- he couldn™t stand that 
Bobby
 
would -- would have been taken by the 
Germans and would su
ffer, you know, and 
die or something, I -- I don™t think he w
ould -- he™s cra -- he was really proud of 
Alfred
, really proud. 
Q: What was their rela
tionship in later life? 
A: Well, it was still Papa
 Ma dn a
, and it -- it was the only father he ever met, so 
yeah, it was a very good relation and it was 
very lucky that he saw him just one 

month before he died
, he visit him. And he was ill, 
and -- but when I visit him, 10 
days befo re his death, he was very  healthy,
 he was good looking, and -- and he said 
well, you know -- I had a long 
talk with him. He said, it™s 
enough for me. I have to -- 
to swallow too many pills. And I said, we
ll, you will o-outlive us, I told him. But 
then 10 days later I got a phone call from my
 brother and he said well, that he died, 

 
Interview with Tolé Madna

48
so -- and -- and 
Bobby 
came to the funeral, and at 
the funeral ceremony I had as 
many difficulties I as -- in the beginning as
 I had with my tear
s in the -- at the 
ceremony this time. But wh en I overcame that
 I said well, he was a man who took 
the risk to save a child™s lif
e. He let the women do the 
work, that was always -- he 
did -- the wo men had to raise the child, he only had so me wise remarks for us, don™t 
do th is and don™t do that, but he was not the ki
nd of father that really  took care of the 
children mentally. He took care of us with
 clothing and food and -- but he didn™t like 
to take risks he said, but some-sometimes
 he was difficult. I didn™t really have a 
good contact with my father. Later, at th
e end maybe. But, he said well -- but he 
took the risk with hi
m, and he was sitting there, yeah
. Yeah, it was some moments.  
Q: Is there anything else you wa
nted to say before we end? 
A: No, I don™t -- th-there are maybe no -- 
more things, but there are so many. And 

we noticed when I talked to 
Bo bby
 last night that there were
 o-other things we all of 
a sudden rememb ered out of th
e house, and th-the funny 
things that happened . But 
we -- we talked about the funny things. 

Q: Do you still feel lik
e he is your brother? 
A: Oh yes, very much, very much. And espe
cially the-these days
 when -- he brought 
us here at four o™clock yest
erday and we had a drink in 
th e bar, and then he picked 
us up at 7:30. I said, you know, I already 
missed you. So you 
have a good contact 

 
Interview with Tolé Madna  
 
April 18, 2002 
 

 
 
49
and I -- I told him, you spoiled us so mu ch
 I -- I don™t think th at I ever can go back 
to a normal life again. It™s hardly possible 
to pay anything and no, it was really an 
experience and I think we are 
even closer now than we 
w-were before. Also with 
Joel
 we have a good understanding and th
ey are very lovely people. So it -- I 
hesitated to come to 
Washington
, and -- but I am glad I did. I didn™t think that I 
would ev er go to  
America
 again after my visit in 
Boston
 and 
Miami
, because not 
too many things, and I met those -- and 
we met some congressmen yes-yesterday 
and they  say hello to  you and th ey say nice 
things and -- and I always had the feeling 
that they didn™t know we we
re there, you know. Bu t we met other, nice people, real 
nice people that talked to us and -- and lis
tened to us, so -- but I met the other kind 
of American, that is -- say, you have a 
nice day, but without meaning. T-Too many 
of them and that makes me -- well, also the things I don™t agree with. Like I -- I 

didn™t agree with 
Vietnam
. I didn't agree with a lot of
 things. The -- the power and 
th-the -- be friendly but still th
at superior feeling they try 
to express. Also the music. 
We met at an -- I remember
 that the delegation from
 Miami
 that visited our school 
because we have connecti
on with the University of
 Miami
, the mu sic department. 
They thought, well it™s always nice to have connection in
 Holland
, you know, 
Euro pe
. But they thought th
ey were much better, and it wa
sn™t so. They were, really 
when  they  heard our students,

gave me some anti feelings, but I know fo r sure that it™s the 
system sometimes I 
hate, but I met so -- so many nice people, t

a nation. But I hope everything will go 
well. And

Holland

Holland

Israel
 has to fight back because they are 
surrounded by enemies.

that want peace, too. But I don™t want to go
 in politics. I think I have -- we have to 
bring the luggage down , eh? 

Q: Well, thank you very mu ch fo r doing th is
 interview. We™re very grateful that you 
did make the trip to the 
United States
. So again, thank you fo r wh at you did many 
years ago, and fo r doing th e interview. This concludes the
