righ t a wa y. 
 
You were just seven and living in the sm all town of  Vacha, Germ any, when 
Hitler cam e topower in 1933. Af terthat, of course, your life and thatof  yourf am ilies 

changeddram atically.  Startby telling us about yourf am ily and your life in the years 

leading up toKristallnacht, bef ore then, whatwas your fam ily's lif e like? T ellus about 

yo u r  f a m i l y.
 

3 
 
>> SusanT aube: W ell, as you said, I was born in the sm all town in them iddle of  
Germ any.  In thetown there were about 30 Jewish f am ilies, and lif ewas normal.  

Norm al lif e.  Veryf ew children,because
 
--
 
I started school in 1932, and in 1934, I went 
to higher education school,but then 1936 Ihad to leave school.  No Jewish children 

were allowed anym ore in the Germ an schools.  And I was sent to Frankf urtam Main 

and attended there. 
 
In 1938
 
--
 
>> B ill B e n
son:  Before we go to Kristallnacht, let me ask you som equestions.W hat 
did yourf ather do to earn a living? W hat was his living?
 
>> SusanT aube:  My fatherhad afam ily storef orm any years already.  Actually, m y 

grandfather on m y mother's sidedied in
 
W orld W ar
 
I,he was a soldier in the Germ an 
Arm y, f ighting f or Germ any in World W ar
 
I, andm y grandm other was a widow and she 
ran a store. Andm y m other grew older, she helped and eventually m y m other got 

m arriedand the storewent on until Hitler cam eto power.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Speaking of Hitler com ing topower, you toldm eabout thefamily that 

were neighbors of  yours, and you told me an incident about voting.  W ill you share that 

with us?  Do you rem em berthey went to vote? 
 
>> SusanT aube: W hen Hitler cam eto power.  Yeah, the elections in Germ any, and 

we all had to go tothe port, and whoever voted, you had to work forHitler because you 

received a little... whatyou call it?  Yeah, I votedfor Hitler, and you would be
 
--
 
even 
though caught without it on the street, without it, even the Jewish people votedf or 

Hitler because nobody knew what was in storef or them  inthef uture, so... we all voted 

f o r Hit le r.
 
>> Bill Benson:  At somepoint I think evenbef oreKristallnacht youstarted having 

vandalism
 
done to your fam ily business.
 
>> SusanT aube:  Yeah, when Hitler cam etopower, then they were against the 

Jewish people. W e had adisplay window in our business,big display windows and 

they were sm ashed inat night. And once we.  Fixed them  up again, they putthe paint, 

andthey put it on the house, and it was quiteaf ew tim es we had toreplace the 

windo ws.  In the beginning, insurance paidfor it andthen insurancewouldn't pay for it 

anym ore, we had to do it ourselves.  Buteventually we bolted up, 
th at's it.
 
>> Bill Benson: T henyou startedto tell usabout Kristallnacht. W hat do you
 
--
 
you 
were still a gir l. W hat do you rem em ber about Kristallnacht? 
 
>> SusanT aube:  As Isaid, Ihad to live with m y
 
--
 
in the littletown,I couldn't go to 
school
 
anym ore. I was separated com pletely f rom  theother children, sitting on a 
bench all by m yself  right next to the door, the f irstone to leave and the last one to 

com e in.  My parents saw m y mental situation becam e
 
--
 
I don't know what you call it.  
Depres
sion, I guess. So they enlisted me ina Jewish school in Frankf urt am  Main, 
andI lived with com plete strangers. In1938,Kristallnachthappened.  T here was a 

young Jewish m an inParis
 
--
 
in 1938, the Polish
 
--
 
the Jewish people who were not 
P o lis h
 
--
 
Ge
rman citizens, born in Germany for generationsalready,you couldn't just 
becom ea Germ an citizen because you were born there.  Youbecam e
 
--
 
you becam e 
a citizenf rom your parents. Living in Germ any m any years, polishchildren are still 

P o lis h .  
 
Ju st  p ic
ked up withoutany warning, put ona train and put on theborder of  
Poland and Germany, andthere's no place to go, nom an's land. 
 

4 
 
So a young m an whowas studying in Paris at that tim e,hefoundout what was 
happening to hisparents, he tried to bring the
 
attention to what ishappening.  He went 
to the Germ an em bassy in Paris and killed one of the off icers there. So when that 
happened,afew weeks later, they organized what they called a pogrom . It was just an 

excuse todem olishall owned by Jewish people or whatever was owned by Jewish 

people was dem olished.  Andthemen werearrestedand sent to concentration camps. 
 
Andall the schools were closed, because all the teachers were arrested too.  
And I just wentbackhom e to m y hom etown at that tim e.  My m other was there.  She 

hadto close the business up.  It couldn'topen up anym ore.  Andmy f ather was in a 

concentration cam pfor aboutfour weeks.  He was dism issedbecause he was in the 

W or ld  W ar
 
I.  He wasoneof  thef irstone to let go. 
 
How do you call
 
it ?  
 
He had a job in certain tim e
 
>> Bill Benson: T heywould let him out of the concentration, but he had
 
--
 
>> SusanT aube: T hey didn't want to spread the word what was happening.
 
>> Bill Benson:  A veteran in the German Army.
 
>> Susan T aube:  Luckily,
 
we looked to imm igrate already
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  Letme ask youanother question about Kristallnacht.  In addition to 

destroying businesses, your home was vandalized? 
 

>> SusanT aube:  Yes, I went to school in Frankf urt am  Main and they just knocked 

dow
n thedoor, cam e in and they destroyed the whole apartm ent, crying out f rom the 
couples, and everything was demolished. 
 
>> Bill Benson: T heyknocked bookcases over.
 
>> SusanT aube:  Busted out the windows.  Itwas terrible.  And they went f rom 

apartm ent 
to apartment and did the sam ething.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Before your f ather was arrested, if I rem em ber correctly, he was
 
--
 
he 
hidf ora coupledays and the Gestapo came.
 
>> SusanT aube:  Gestapo cam eand said, if he doesn't give him self up, youhave to 

t a ke  
m y m other into the cam p.  So m yf athergave him self  up and they took him  to 
Buchenwald, where he worked forf our weeks, and let gobecausehe was aWorld 

W ar
 
I veteran.  He had to leave Germany righ t away.  He couldn't stay in Germ any. 
 
So we were ready to em igrate. T hings becam ebad in Germ any.  W edidn't see 
any futurethere anymore.  But we had no place to go. W e wantedto go to America.  

Relatives in America, som ebody to vouchfor you.  And even if  youfound somebody to 

vouchf or you, they had to put a certainamount of money in thebank and then you 

received a number and you had to waitf or your num ber to come up.  And a lot of 

people wanted to imm igrate and the numberwas ver y high and when we found out 

how
 
--
 
when it would be, they told us it wouldbe aboutfour years before our num ber 
would be called. 
 
In them eantim e, came Kristallnacht andm y father was arrested,and he was let 
go , b u t...
 

>> Bill Benson:  So you couldn't im m igrate, you couldn't get out becauseof  thedelays 

and the requirem ents 
andall the things described. So whatdid hedo?W hatdid your 

father do then?
 

>> SusanT aube:  Hewent over the border and he paid somebody to go over the 

border, without anything, a little suitcase and just what he had on his body, anda lot 

5 
 
of
 
--
 
it  h
appened to a lot of people atthat time, anda lotof peoplewent this way, lef t 
Germ any this way, but the Jewish com munity in Belgium  welcomedever ybody, and 
they couldn't work or do anything like that,but they had soup kitchens there and 

people took them  inand gave them f ood.  Sowhile in Belgium  his num ber came upfor 

im m igrationto America, and because he had lef t, thepapers had togo to Belgium, and 

thatprolonged the whole system  about six m onths,eight months. And in the 

m eantim e the war broke out, so that stopped ever ything.  But he m ade it out just 

bef ore Am erica went into the war, just bef ore they invaded Belgium , just bef orethey 

invaded Belgium , hemade it out.  He got to Am erica in February of 1940.
 
>> Bill Benson:  1940, right?
 

>> Susan T au
be:  Som ething like that, yeah.  1941. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  So here you are with your m other and your grandm other, andI think 

you m oved to Berlin to be close to the U.S. consulate in thehope that you might still
 
--
 
>> SusanT aube: W em ight still go toAmerica.  So we m ovedto Berlin.  My m other 

worked to sell the house.  She was the only Jewish f am ily still li vin g i n that sm all town, 

and life was just m iserable for her.  So she sold the property, almost gave it away.  

Shenever received the moneyf or itbec
ause af ter 1938, af ter Kristallnacht, all the 
m oney was conf iscated, and you received only a certain am ountforyour expenses, 

what you needf orfood and whatever.  But only a certain am ountof m oney.  You 

couldn't have any m ore.  Andthemoney stayed with
 
the governm ent. 
 
And then we m oved toBerlin. W e received
 
--
 
m y m other,m y sister, m y 
grandm other,father'sm other still with us, and m yself , anda lot of  little towns where 

Jewish peoplem ovedaway to bigger cities, so we were what you called...
 
>> B i l l
 
Benson:  Crowded together?
 
>> SusanT aube:  Crowded together, right. W ehad one bedroom ,comm unal living 

room , com munal kitchen, comm unal bathroom , just one private bedroom , that's all, 

and youall slept in one bedroom . 
 
Life inBerlin, by that tim eI was a teenager. I had to goto work.  So m y f irst job 
was as a day care worker to take care of children. Because all hadto work f orthe war 

eff ort. T hey all had to work in f actoriesf or the war m achinery.  Andthe children gotup 

at 6:00 in them orning. 
 
W ehad to be there at6:00 until m orning until 9:00 o'clockat 
night when the last child was picked up. Andwe had to take public transportation.  

Andalso in1939, it was, or '40 we all received the honorof  wearing a nice yellow star, 

and we had to wear iton our outer clothes so we would be recognizedfor whoever we 

are.  Andthat wasn't a ver y pleasant situationbecause we had to use public 

transportation at that tim e, and, you know, wh en you're young and branded like this, 

you tried tohide it. But if you were caught hiding it, you received apunishm ent too.  
 
So anyhow, I worked in the children's homeandthey got droppedoff  inthe 
m orning and worked all day until 8:00o'clockat nightand then wenthome,and that 

was it.  Seven days aweek.
 
>> B i l
l Benson:  And,Susan, the deportation started and you and yourf am ily were 
deportedto Riga, Latvia.
 
>> SusanT aube:  Started in thef allof  1941,and whathappened there, we lived 

wi t h
 
--
 
there was another gentlem an living and another lady, and the daugh
te r  of  t h e 
gentleman lived afew blocks away and oneday he tried to get in touch with her and 

there was no answer. Didn't know what happened to her. About two weeks later he 

6 
 
received a notef rom Poland, yourf ather, due to circum stances,Germ an citizen 
f ro m 
Poland will be resettled to Germany. W e are settled here. W earefine, don't worry 
about us.  You will hear f rom  us again. And that was the only tim e he heardf rom  

them , nothing else. 
 
T hen slowly deportation started andthe nextoneI knew about w
as m y best 
girlf riend.  It becam e very organi zed then.  You receiveda noticeby m ail, so and so, 

this day you be ready, you wi ll be resettled totheeast.  You can take with you what 

you can carry.  Everyth ing else, what you would like totake, bigger item s, you leave at 

a certain place and it will be shippedto your new destination.  Nevertold where or 

where it goes toor where we are going or whatever. W e were never told. 
 
Our time cam e, m y mother, m y grandm other,m y sister, m yself, in the winter we 
wo
rked actually inf actories, and we thought if  you workedfor the war eff ort, you kind 
of  exempt
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  Be exem ptf rom  that?
 
>> SusanT aube:  But, no, that didn't helpany.
 
>> Bill Benson:  If I rem em ber right you were  in afactory m aking subm a
r i ne  

equipm ent.
 
>> SusanT aube:  Receivers f or submarines. Andthe Jewish people, the Jewish 

em ployees were kept separately f rom  the Christian people. The Christian people 

received lunches,food.  W e received nothing.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And they received p
a y?
 
>> SusanT aube:  Pay was not
 
--
 
pay was nothing at all. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  And you were toldthat if  you were suspected of any sabotage you 

would be executed?
 
>> SusanT aube:  Better not, yeah. 
 
So we worked
 
--
 
where was I?
 
>> Bill Benson:  Deportation 
to Riga .
 
>> SusanT aube: W ereceived a notif ication to be ready on thisandthis day.  You can 

take with you what you can carry.  Ever ything else you bring toa certain place and it 

wi ll be shipped to yournew destination. Sof irst of all we put a lotof
 
clothes on.  T he 
Gestapo came and said it would com e.  Show us all your bank books, paper.  Money 

you can take with youfor transportation,public transportation. Everything you leave 

here,and this is it.  You sign your papers, you sign the note. 
 
S o  we
 
tookour littlepackage.  W e couldn't take much. And we took public 
transportation in Kristallnacht, the point of concentrationfor all the people. It was 

Friday night, I remember that, andeventually, about100,000 people.  Children, young 

people, old people,m ixture of population.  And itbecam e
 
--
 
we had a lotof  clothes on 
us. W ef igured what we have on us we can take. But anywa y, they stayed in that 

placefor about two or three days.  You were registered. Again, we had onemore ID 

left. So you would be recognized.  Nobody has passports anym ore, they were 

conf iscated. T hat was taken away f rom us too.  Andthen we foundout we would be 

resettled toa place called Riga, Latvia.  Okay, Riga, Latvia. 
 
Sunday m orning, we were assem bled inf rontof  the
 
synagogue and we were 
m arched to a station in Berlin, the capitalof  Berlin, and we lookedf or the train to be 

resettled to Riga. Andwhat we sa w was the cattle cars.  Only cattlecars. T he doors 

were opened and we looked inside and wentinside and ther
e were benches m ade out 

7 
 
of  straw all around the wall, on each sideof  the end of the wagon.  A bucket of water.  
T ha t wa s it. 
 
Once thetrain wasf ull, everybody was in, we went, we traveled fourdays and 
four nights I remem ber.  Very cold winter in Januar
y 
1942. It was very, very cold.  No 
heat in the wagons, nothing. 
 
W earrived in Riga the end of  January
 
--
 
no, beginning of  February, it was, end 
of  January.  I don't remem ber exactly the date.  End of January, I think it was.  And 

they opened up the wagons, out, out,out.  Everybody out.  You could hardly move 

because of the cold.  You were stiff . Old people couldn'tm ove. W e were told if  you 

ca n  
--
 
you have to walk about 10
-
kilometers,if  you cannot walk, there are trucks, you 
can go inthe trucks and we'll take you to your new destination. W ell, the people who 

went on the truck, we never saw again.  It was m ostly olderpeople,children, it was 

hard to walk for them .  They went on the trucks and we never saw them again.  My 

fam ily, we walked. W e walked 10
-
kilometers,slow in ice, very slo wl y.  Ittookalmost 
the whole day.  And we cam e to a place in Riga, which was
 
--
 
whatwas it called?  A 
sectionof  the city of  Riga, a very poor section it was. W e came to the place and they 

pushed us in apartm ents and no light, no heat, nothing.  And we saw food laying there 

and clothes everywher e aroundthe place. W e didn't know what happened. But it was 

nighttim e. W e didn't give it m uchthought. So we f ound aplace to sit and sat down 

a n d th at wa s it.  In the m
orning when daylight  came we looked around, we went 
outside and a lotof  ice and snow andf orce of elements. T errible sight. 
 
So we didn't know what happened.  Back to the house, nof ood, nothing.  
Eventually we recei ved a piece of bread.T here was som efood lef t in the apartment, 

which we eventually figured out we eat. AndFebruary
 
5th,I rem ember this like today, 
ever ybody out of the buildings, everybody as sem ble in the street.  The place was 

surrounded,two tim es.  Completely surrounded.  You couldn't
 
go out of  the place 
there. And we were assem bled and looked over and the trucks were staying there. 

And they looked us over and just likethis, this, this... if  you went this wa y, you went on 

the truck, and you went this way, you went back to thehouse.
  
My gr andm other was 
taken away f rom us.My m other,m y sister andm yself , we went back into thehouse.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Susan, I remem ber youtelling m e thatthey would tell the elderly 

people that were with you who were going toput you in af ishf actory
 
where you can 
work indoors.
 
>> SusanT aube: T hesecond time around, yeah. W ell, in them eantim e there came 

transportsf rom  all over Germany, Austria, back f rom Germany, Jewish people, 

transportedthere.  And eventually the ghettowas overf lowing, and in
 
February
 
--
 
end 
of  February, again, everybody out of the house, selections were com ing and people 

taken away, al ways taken away. 
 
A lot of children they are taking away and invalid people. Peoplethey figured 
could work, they kept them alive for a while.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Susan, you would rem ain in the Riga ghettof or20m onths, f rom the 

endof  January, early February
 
1942 to Decem ber
 
1943. Tell us what your life was like 
in the Riga ghettoover those 20 months, what you were f orced to do, and you touche
d 
on this a little bit,but the im age youdescribed of  arriving in a placethat is just covered 

in ice, indoors,outdoors, just a coating of  thick ice on everything, and I think the very 

f irst job you were m ade todo was to
 
--
 

8 
 
>> SusanT aube:  Go to the city of  Riga and supplied us with
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  Like iron rods?  Ice picks.
 
>> SusanT aube:  Icepicks. W e hadto loosen the icef rom  the sidewalk so the 
citizens of Riga couldwalk on the sidewalks. W e were not allowed to walk on the 

sid e wa lks.   W e 
had towalk in the streets. Before we went through,a piece of dry 
bread, nothing warm  to eat all this tim e, nothing at all.  Just bread. And that was it. 
 
So we m archedto thecity and worked all day f rom m orning, daylight until 
nighttim e came,and back
 
tothe ghetto.  Back to the ghettothere was nothing to look 
forward to.  If you were lucky, som ebody in the street gave you something to eat, 

actually.  Som e citizens of  the street.  And then eventually we recei ved somef ood in 

the ghetto.  It was organized. We received some rations in the ghetto, but no place to 

cook oranything like that, so people became
-
engineers, thepeople there, theyf ound 
scraps of  iron or whatever it is and they build little stovesf rom  it. And while we went to 

work and f ound a
 
piece of  wood or som ething, we picked it upand took ithom eand 
that'show we cookedour stuff.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You shared with me there was an attemptby all the Jews there to try 

to create some senseof  a community while you were there, try to do som e
 
education if  
possible.
 
>> SusanT aube: T hechildren still were in school, like the day carecenter.T hey 

were never allowed to go in the streets, the children. They were alwa ys supervised by 

old people in homes
 
--
 
I mean, in room s, wherever they were li vin g.  Or they had aday 
care centerfor children, and the towns hadtogo to work, andthey had the children 

anddropped them off and they never could go outside. T hey were never allowed to go 

outside, the children.
 
>> Bill Benson: What was the other work yo u were forcedto do while you were there?
 
>> SusanT aube:  Besides shoveling snow, the next job I workedf ortheair force. 

T hat was a good job, because inside you arenotexposedto the cold weather.  And we 

sat in thebasementand sorted out potatoes. T hey delivered the food tothem , but 

ever ything was f rozen.  So we had to pickout the goodonesf rom the bad ones.  And 

that was good, because the badones we could take hom e with us. Actually, we were 

allowed to take hom e,but they tastedhorrible
. 
 
But,again, you know, you work f or the m ilitary, som e people hadahuman 
heart. You couldf ind som e human beings among them . And I say that
 
--
 
if  you didn't 
have someone
 
--
 
not to lookoutf or you,buthave a littlebit off eeling what was going 
on andhelp youa little bit, that's lif e really.
 
>> Bill Benson:  At som epoint you were forced to go outsidethe ghetto, I think, to 

d ig...
 

>> SusanT aube: T hat was in the summ ertime. T hey called it peatm oss,and they 

use itfor heating and cooking, and so
 
--
 
and they would take the young girls, m ostly 
young gir ls and young m en and send outside the ghetto about 40 or 50
-
k ilo m et e rs  
outside the ghetto,and there were bigf ieldsand we had to dig outpeatmoss f rom 

there,and that was dug out andputonbridges and puton the lawn to be dried and 

turned over and driedup again, and then it was shipped intothe city.  And that was
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  Usedasfuelf or the citizens there?
 
>> SusanT aube:  Yes.  Not toobad, actually. W e went swim m ing a little bit
.  You 
know, a reprieve of  som e sortf ora while.
 

9 
 
>> Bill Benson:  LateAugust or September
 
1943 you were broughtback into the ghetto 
and what you said tom e was, we kind of knew what the ball gam ewas then. That was 
a quotef rom  you. 
 
>> SusanT aube: W ell, we heardnews. W e had some kind of
 
--
 
we  didn'thave radios 
or anything like that.  Nobody had a radio, buttheplaces we workedhad radios,and if  

you hada chance, you could always l isten tothenews, and there was always
 
--
 
the 
good news was the Germ anshad a successful retreat, always a successf ul retreat. 

Very slow.  In Riga, until 1944, the ghetto was liquidatedand we all went to 

concentration cam ps.  Actually concentrationcam p.  Men and wom en were separated.  

T here were nom ore children there. Everybody had to go to work.  Mostly young 

people, no old peopleanym ore. But, again, I have to say, I was lucky.  Bef ore the 

ghetto was liquidated there was anorganization,and the Germ an Arm y, they made 

bridges and we cam e to thisplaceand we had
 
to repair theboats. 
 
T he situation was also like a reprievef orus really, becausethe onewho 
oversaw it was a civi lian, aGerman civilian, and he was one of f ive sons.  Four were 

already gone on thef ront.  So anyone alive was m adea director of thefa
c ilit y.   I  ha ve  

to say hehad ahum an heart.  He could
 
--
 
not help us, but m ake it more pleasant than 
it's supposed tobe.
 
>> Bill Benson:  He could have m ade it worse?
 
>> SusanT aube:  Hehada humanheart, put it this way.  Buthe couldn'thelpus 

anywa y
.  And the Russian arm y cam e closerand we evacuated, the whole arm y, Riga, 
the German Arm y, so the ghetto was elim inated andold people disappeared. And 

people who were ableto work were put onaboat.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Before you go there, as youwere being evacuatedf rom  Kaiserwald, 

you explained this was m id1944, the summer of  1944, you said there was a period 

where you were just waiting, and groupsof  young people were sent out.  Do you 

rem em ber telling me that? 
 
>> SusanT aube:  You know, Riga had a very nice population, Jewish populationat 

thattim e, but when they cam e in,all but 4,000 menelim inated. T hey kept 4,000m en 

to work, butall elim inated. 
 
By the end, whentheGerm an and Russianarm y cam e closer,they wanted to 
ge t
 
--
 
cover up what they
 
d id , I 
guess, and the people from Kaiserwald, they organized 
groups of 40m en each day.  They had to go out. And whoever wenton the job during 

theday, they never cam e back.T hey killed them there. Becausethey didn't wantany 

wit n e sse s.  

>> B ill B e n s o
n: T he next day another groupof  40.
 
>> SusanT aube:  Next day, another 40, another 40...
 
And what was lef tthen, we were all deportedon a boatand shippedto 
Germ any, concentration, which was an exterm ination.
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us about Stutthof.
 
>>
 
SusanT aube:  Beautif ul lawns, beautifulf lowers. W e thought we were in heaven. 
W e walk in, thepicture changed very quickl y.  Nothing but barracks. People walking 

around, hungry, m iserable, shaved their heads.  Our heads were shaved before we lef t 

Rig
a actually. W e were all bald, no hair on our heads. 
 
And lif e in Kaiserwald was in them orning, 5:00 o'clock.  Just like sardines. At 
thattim e we had wooden shoes. 
 

10
 
 
Luckily, I was only about two weeks in Stutthof . Stutthof, Germ any, right?  
Yeah, Stutthof , they took usout.  One day they counted and counted, counted400 
wom en, tookusf rom  the cam p, put us on the train and sentus to aplace called 

Sophienwalde.  The
y 
arri ved there, the cam p was m adeout of plywood, little huts 
m ade out of  plywood, and 
each hut pushed 15 people, only straw on thef loor, nothing 

else.  Oneblanket we had. 
 
And so thef irst thing we didn't know what todo. T he next day we had to get 
out.W e were calledout.  The whistle blew and we had to get out and be counted. 

T here were ladiesf rom theSS, we had three,three ladies. Martha,Erica and...
 
One was abeast.  One was m ore human.  And the other one couldn't care less 
as long as shehad aboyfriend.  She was okay. 
 
So that was our lives.  So every day we had to go to work in them orning. We 
received shovels and picks and stuff, and wem arched to woods and we had to take 

out the woodf rom theground, because they were supposed to build am ilitary exercise 

cam p there.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You had to dig out all the roots?
 
>> S u s
anT aube: W ehadto getall the rootsoutf rom the trees.  It was hard work.  It 
wasn't easy. W e were girls, not men.W e didn't havem uscles.  Butwe had to do it, 

pull them out and then we had to push them  over to a dump where ever ything was 

dumped.  T
hen backto the woods andfill it up again.  Andthat was our day's work. 
 
W ereceived a pieceof bread in theevening and a piece of bread when we 
cam e backf rom  work, and if you had abowl, if  you were lucky and had a bowl, you 

received a bowl of  soup and that was ournourishm ent
 
>> Bill Benson:  In the late winter of 1945 as the Russians advanced, you were 

evacuatedf rom  there and forced to goon what is known as a deathm arch? 
 
>> SusanT aube: T hey took us to thisunf inishedbuilding that we built, and
 
in the 
basem ent, we were there.  But, again,noheat, no nothing.  Justone piece of bread 

and a soup. 
 
February, Russianarmy cam e m uch closer,and oneday the com mander came 
and said
 
--
 
assembledus and said, look, we cannot stay here. TheRussians are
 
here.  
W ehave tom igratef rom  here. If  you're able to walk, you sign up, you can walk.  And 

if  youare not able to walk, you stay hereandsom ebody will take care of  you. 
 
W ell, theones who signedup, they m archedoutand the ones whostayed 
behind, we
 
never heardf rom  them again. 
 
W emarchedten days.  Every day, kilom eter,kilom eter, wooden shoes,f limsy 
coat, not much. 
 

>> Bill Benson:  And especially brutal winter.
 
>> Susan T aube:  1942
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  1945?
 
>>
 
SusanT aube: T errible, terrible cold winter. W alking on ice and snow and walking 
through villages, and kids were throwing snowballs atus. It was justterrible.  At night 

they putus ina barn and in the morning we m archagain. And that was it forten
 
days 
until we came to aplace called Sophienwalde. 
 
Sophienwalde we entered the cam p.  It was
 
--
 
it used to be POW cam pfor 
Russian POW s,and they already evacuated too. So we went in there. T hen we went 

there it was em pty but eventually it f illed up because people cam ef rom all over the 

11
 
 
place. There were cam ps everywhere, wher e people workedall over eastern 
Germ any, andf rom  the cam ps,the Russianarm y cam e closer, wewere all 

concentrated inthat place. I don't know, I have no idea.
 
W e went to this place two weeks, three weeks.  Again,the Russianarm y cam e 
close. W eheard the shooting already.  And they assembled us, wecannot stay here.  

If you can march, we have to leave. And most of us went at that time.  And we 

m archeda whole night and we cam
e to a place in the m orning, and they put us in a 
barn and closed the door, and that was it. They lef tus there. 
 
W ell, we laid down.  There were anim als there, and just
 
--
 
in the early m orning 
hours, we heard big boom s, and we said,oh,no, they're com ing closer, they're meant 

for us. But it was the Russian arm y that was chasing the Germ an Arm y.  And we were 

liberated by the Russian arm y on March
 
10th, 1945. 
 
T he doors were opened. W e wentout. T heGerm an people packed their 
wagons because they wanted to go west away f rom the Russian arm y.  And they 

packed what they could take with them . Andwe became
 
--
 
what doyou call it? W ell, 
we had our f irst f ood, and m y f irst food was a piece of  bacon. 
 
I  go t  sick.   I  su re  go t  sick.  
 

Yeah. T hey told us, don't eatanything. W ewere told not toeat anything at all 
because our stom achs couldn't take any food.  Just couldn't takefood. 
 
So the Russians tookus to work. T hey saidyou could work for theGerm ans, 
you can work for us too. 
 
So we were taken to afarm ,
 
Germanfarm, where the peoplehad left already 
also.  And we had to clear thef ields, put the seedsdown, take careof the animals that 

were lef t there.  But we were cleaned up. W egot clean clothes, andwe hadf ood, 

potatoes in them orning, potatoesatnoon, and potatoesat night.  Potato was the 

m ainstay.  Soon enough we all looked beautiful. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Speaking of looking beautif ul, Susan, andI know our time is running 

short, that leads, of course, to you having to tell us how you met your futu
re husband.  

W ill youdo that? 
 
>> SusanT aube: W ell, thefarm  was f inished and everything was in the ground and 

taken careof , thenextjob was the Russians took us toa city calledKielce and the 

Germ an population lef t and we hadto cleanout the houses
 
and put them in whatever 
we f ound in the houses, went into warehouses and shippedto Russia.  Don'tf orgetthe 

Germ ans
 
--
 
it was all sent to Russia, and that was our job. W edidn't cookfor 
ourselves. W e hada comm unal kitchen. Atthat tim ethere were 
t e n girls ,  a ll li ve d  in  

an apartm ent,andtengirls, but we didn't cook for ourselves.  Therewas a comm unal 

kitchen run by a Jewis h officerf rom Rom ania, and oneday we went thereto eatand 

that was it. But the people atethere.  Andone day a youngm an
 
showed up thereand 
we have survi vors her e and we have som e sick people here. How about you look af ter 

these peopleand takea look, if  you can helpa sick person. 
 
So he went andhe looked at m yf riend, andwhile he was a doctor in the 
Russian arm y, and
 
that's how I metm y husband, who was a doctor in the Russian 
a rm y a t tha t tim e . 
 
>> Bill Benson: T here's m ore to it than that, because
 
--
 
if I can share a little bit, the 
young wom en were wo rried about the Russian soldiers that were around, so
 
--
 
>> S u s a
n T aube: W e had to protect ourselves ver y m uch.
 

12
 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Herman putupa sign saying, this group of wom en are under 
quarantinef or infectious disease.  Andthen the story continues. Hedid somebribing 

with vodka?
 

>> SusanT aube:  And takem e out
 
of the re ...
 
>> Bill Benson:  And got you ina tank thathe had gotten som ebodyto drive with you in 

the tank.
 
>> SusanT aube:  Outof the place, yeah. T hen we went
 
--
 
together we went to
 
--
 
he  
was in the Russian arm y, a doctor inthe Russian arm y, and we
 
went and occupied 
eastpart of Germ any.  We were in eastern Germ anyf or a while, andthen we went 

back to Poland and we got m arried.  And we lived in Polandfor a while until 19
 
--
 
what 
was it? 
 
T he Polish didn't like very m uch when the Jewish people cam e
 
back to the 
cities, which they occupied in the meantime,andthey wanted thehousesback.  So 

they organized thepogrom  inthe city of Kielce, and killedall the Jewish people who 

cam e backf rom  the cam p.  And that we wanted to stay in Poland. There was 
no 

futurefor Jewish people in Poland, andtherewere organi zations, Jewish organi zations 

thattook peopleout ofPoland and that's where we wound up in eastGerm any.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Susan, in the littletim e we have lef t, how did you locate yourf ather, 
a s 

you told us earlier, had m ade itto the UnitedStates? 
 
>> SusanT aube:  My fatherm ade it out, justbef ore Am erica went into the war.  And I 

kepthis address inm y head the whole tim e. I never forgot his address.  And when we 

were liberated andback andf orth, we didn't have anywhere to go, Ihada letter 

prepared just in case I hadanopportunity som ehow.  Soone time along the way I saw 

an Am erican soldier and I askedhim  if he would dom e afavor anddeliver this letter to 

this address. And he did.
  
And that'show m y father knew that I'm alive.  But we 
couldn't correspond becauseI hadno permanentaddress yet.  So once Ihad a 

permanent address, Iwrote tohim again,and that's how we got in touch.
 
>>
 
Bill Benson: W hendid youfinally get to the United States? 
 
>> SusanT aube: W ecam e in 1947.
 
>> Bill Benson: T wo years af ter the war ended.
 
>> SusanT aube: W ewent back to Poland. W e wanted to stay in Poland, actually, but 

af ter that pogrom we lef t.
  
So we went to Germ any and at that tim eAm ericaopened up 
thedoors, which were ver y closed before thewar, but the doors were opened up and 

we cam e to Am erica.Sincem y father was in America, he vouchedfor us too, so we 

cam e to America.
 
>> Bill Benson:
  
Susan, when did you learn about what happened to your m other and 
sist e r?  

>> SusanT aube: W ell, we were separated in Riga.  I went toone work camp, they 

went to another work cam p.  W ehad no control over our lives.  Af terthe war, I 

rem em ber now I kept
 
in touch with a wom anwho worked togetherwith m y m other in 
the last cam p, and she toldm e whathappened tom y m other. My m otherdiedactually 

of  natural causes in that cam p,f rom  starvation.  But she always taught me she was 

good.  Shehad a job.She was the cleaning lady, so she didn't have to work too hard.  

And shealso got 
--
 
typhus broke outand shediedand so didm y sister.
 
>> Bill Benson: W e have questionsf rom  theaudience, isthat okay? 
 
If you don'tm ind we have
 
--
 
our ushershave m icrophones and we're going to 

13
 
 
ask that if  youhave aquestion,pleasem ake sure you have a m icrophone so it will be 
passed down to you. Pleasemake your question as brief as you can, and I will repeat 

the question just to make sure that we notonly hear it here but everybody hears it in 

theaudience.  So whowould like to askSusan a question, if  anybody would? We 

have a couplem inutes to do this. W ehave one here. Thank you, sir.
 
>>  How wel l were you received in the UnitedStates and how were you 
em ployed or your husbandemployed once you cam eback to the states?
 
>> Bill Benson: T he question is:  How were you received once you got to the United 

States and how did you basically f inancially m anage, how did Herm anf ind work and 

yourself ? 
 
>> Susan T aube:  T he Jew
ish com munity in Am erica was very generous at that tim e, 
andthey had sponsors, and they helped quite a bit. T he Jewish comm unity helped.  

O u r f i rs t
 
--
 
well, we cam etom y father.  My f ather was here, so didn't have to worr y too 
m u ch with  m y fa m ily, bu t w

husbanddidn't speakEnglish.  I spokea little English, I learned in school,and hisf irst 

job was in the Jewish bakery cutting bagelsat night.T hat's what he did.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And then he learned 
E n glis h ?
 
>> SusanT aube:  Night school. W eall went to night school.  Every night, night school.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And when you

>> W ere you able to observe Shabbat or any of  theholidays atall?
 
>> Bill Benson: Were you able to observe Shabbat orany Jewish holidays at all at that 

t im e ?
 
>> SusanT aube: W ehad the synagogue in the ghetto. My m other
 
usedto go. I had 
to work.  There was no choice.  If  youhad towork, you had to work.  My m other, she 

went.  Yeah.  Jewish life... we didhave concerts, come to think of it.W e didhave 

concerts.T he Riga ghetto was actually two ghettos.  One wasf or the Latvian Jews 

andonef or theGerman Jews.  TheLatvian Jews had artists in their group, and we 

had concerts actually.  And listened to it.  For f ree. 
 
[ Laughter ]
