I am i mmediately tr ansported back

 we had r ecei ved

Amer ica t o go to see 
the American  co ns ul in

morni ng.  It was Dece mber

and my sist er and I ar e 
enjoying a very ha ppy a nd special  
breakfast at a friend's house i n
 a  beautiful part  of Buda pest ,

brea kfast  and that a nnounce me nt on the ra di o re s u

[Japanese naval forces attacked
 Pearl Harbor on December  7, 
1941 at  7:55 a . m Ha wai i  ti me ;  
Hungary di d not  de clare  war  on t h

but Ger many a nd Italy did s o on 
December 11; Britai n declared war on Hungary on
 Dec e mber  6, 1941; t he  Unite d Stat es declar ed  
war  on Hungary on J une  5, 1942]. 
 
 
 
So Hunga ry wa s not  the  
promi sed la nd i n 1941?
 
 
Hungary wa s the cursed land fr om the day I reme mb
er.  I  was al ways call ed
 the dirty Jew, smelly 
Jew, the translation is smelly Je
w.  And I was cal led t hat  by my 
cl assmat es and as I  was wal king 
down the main streets of
 my  ho me  t o w n  Kis v ar d a
 t he ri ffraff hanging about
 referred to me as t he 
smelly Jew.  I was not sme
lly, a  ve ry dear c hil d of a  wonder ful J ewi
sh fa mil y .  I had to
 live with this 
 
insult al ways and we thought that  that's  the way it
 is ever ywhere. It 's cert a
inly that way where I a m 
living.  The anti-semitism wa
s fierce always.  
If it was not on 
the surface it was 
so deeply imbedded 
in t he char acter of the people we 
shared the town with, the non-Jews 
that i t was a li ving presence 
always . I do not r e me mb er 
anythi ng but an anti- s e mi t i c at mos pher e
.  That 's what  I grew up i n, that 's 
what I lived in, that
's what I hoped to escape. 
Wh en Hitler came of courseall that was intensified a 
thousand fold and 
there was no escape.
 
 

Could we back up a little 
bit and talk about the fa
mily and growing up in Kisv
arda.  Wh en were you 
bor n?
 
 
 
In May 28 1921.
 
 
In Kisvarda? 
 
 
In Kisvarda.
 
 
Yo ur  fa mil y ?
 
 
The y wer e , my mot her  I  belie ve 
bor n in the  town s he gre w up i n
 she came from a t own called 
Haj duna nas .  I have ne ve r be en th
ere it was some kilomete
rs  a wa y, pr obabl y not  
ve ry fa r, but  those  
days it seemed far.  And she was 
the daught er of a very di stinguis h
ed rabbi.  It was a wh ole line of 
rabbi nic al ba ckgr ound.  From what
 I underst and it  wa s a  ver y dist
i nguishe d ra bbi nical  bac kgr ound 
her mother wa s a  Schr e i be
r [scri be].  The word 
Sc hrei ber
 i s a writer [a scri
be ] a n d I  thi nk in 
Hebrew it was called 
Sofair
 and ther e is great di stinction to that  na me  and I think that all of the 
Schreibers
 are the same fami
ly all over the world. 
 M y gra ndmot her I t h in
k was actually the one 
who inherit e d t he  ra bbi nical see d. 
It  comes from her fath
er  I  beli eve.  And 
that she must  have 
mar r ied my grandfat her  whos e  na me
 wa s Halpert and he  beca me  the rabbi of the town Hajdunanas 
and then he died before
 I  was bor n a nd my mot h er
 had enor mous  re spe c t and high, t re mendously 
high re gar d for her fathe r .  I  al wa ys  hear d her t a
l k a bout her father , not  so muc h a bout  her  mot her  
whom we knew and I don't 
know, we  wer en't  craz y about  her, but
 my  gra n d fath e r  my  mo ther  sp ok e  
of with tremendously hi
gh regard that he was an extrao
rdinarily intelligen
t man and a great 
Talmudic scholar who has written 
Talmudic works as ma
ny members of the 
fa mily have written 
many large Talmudic contributions
 t o t he Tal mu dic lit erat ure and 
I  re me mber big books  that wer e  
written by them, various me
mbers of my mothers fa mi ly.  And my mother cl
aimed always that her 
father as she spoke 
of him she would say that 
he was a very sensitive ma
n and that he was very 
intelligent and he was so 
sensitive that he could no
t live with the idea that
 man kills his fellow man 
and evidentl y he di ed of a heart  at
t a c k.    B ut my  mo ther  a l w a ys  ass o
ci ated his death  wit h t he first  
wo rld  war  t hat  it  was  s uch  a bl ow
 to his  phi los ophy of 
huma nity t hat  he  c oul dn't  l i ve  with t he  
brutal ity of t he war  even though I  
a m sure  t hat  he kne w t he  hi s tory of
 t he world was fu
ll of wa rs but 
probabl y be caus e he wa s right  in
 the midst of this world wide 
conflict which wa
s evidently not 
much of a war in comparis
on to the one that foll
owed it.  And I 
always heard thes
e very sensitive 
talks about  my gr andfat her.   Sh
e e v identl y l oved hi m very much. I 
ne ver met  hi m.   He die d duri n g 
the first worl d war, several year
s be fore I was bor n.  M y mother 
was one of s eve n c hildren.  There  
wer e five gir l s and t w o boys .  Both
 of t he boys  beca me rabbi s.   My uncl e, one  of my uncles , was  
the rabbi in [ph 124 Shumkutch?
] which eventually became Ro ma ni
a and Transylvania you know 

aft er t he first Worl d Wa r and I 
re me mber  hi m well  b
eca us e he c a me t o our  hous e  once and I  
re me mb er hi m o n a  Su nd ay mo rn in g l i steni ng  to  
t he r adi o and be cause  in 
his own home as a rabbi 
he  di d not  have  one  in t h ose  days  and he was  an
 e nor mous ly t all bea uti fu
l looking man 
with a long 
bear d and t he long ka ft an a nd a 
remarkably sophist icated for th
e  positi on he was i n.  And my  
mother s younger  brot her  be ca me  t he  ra bbi  a fte r his  
father  di ed in this to
wn, Hajduna nas , but  al so 
very tall and very disti
nguished looking gentle ma n.
  Whenever I  heard about
 my  mo t h er 's  fa mil y  
fr om strangers, visitors, people 
who  we  me t  as  we  tr av
el led somewhere, t hat  they were a very  
special family because th
e members of the fa mily were very in
telligent and very cultivated people .  
My mother was in particul
ar spoken of as 
the most intelligent 
of all.  The kids
 who had worldly 
a mbiti ons  that s he could not  ful fil l be caus e s he  was 
t he da ughter of a  ra bbi .  She  ha d t o  toe  the li ne  
so to speak and could no
t  do reall y  what  she wanted t o  do, 
but  her  mind was so act ive that  sh e 
absorbed all of the worl dly influe
nc es   not  only t h at ca me her  wa
y but  t hat  she so
ught out  and she 
was a reader. She's r
ead such an enormous amou
nt.  She was so cultivated
 and her ambition was to 
become a physician wh
ich she, of course, could 
not fulfill because of the st
atus of her family.  You  
know the  ve ry reli gious rabbi nic al daughter would 
not go t o a medi cal s c hool, of c ourse, but  sh e  
would ha ve  to get  ma rri ed at  t he  
a g e of ei ghte e n or  ninet ee n to 
a  c hose n gr oom who was  of hi gh 
reput ation. My fat her  was t he  s on of
 a  la ndowner , a ver y r eligious  J e
wish family from a small town . 
But  an arr anged marriage came ab
out because he was an outstand
ing Talmudic Ye
shi va  Buc her . 
How do you transl ate Yes hiva  Buc her ?  [Yes hiva st ude nt ]
 
 
Ra bbi nical  s c hool
 
 
Ra bbi nical  s chool and he had an e x traor dinar y 
mi nd. As  pe ople  were  ta
lking about my mother 
being so ver y i ntelli gent he was bei n g tal ke d abou
t as being the most  lear ned Talmudic st udent and 
inde ed he wa s real ly fa mous.  
Even to the point if today I go 
t o one of these  we ddi ngs, t h e  
desc endant s of t hese  peop
le who come from my  mo ther's  hom
etown or my  homet
own or  a ny ot her  
part of Hungary, they would re
member this very intelligent To
by, my mother's
 Yiddish name.
 
 
To by  
 
 
Tere za, Terr y M aria  Te re za wa s her Hungaria n na me  
 
 
Maria Tereza?
 
 
Maria Tereza, evidently she was na me d after the 
Ha ps bur g que en a nd my mo
t her  na me d me  a fte r  
Queen Isabel la. I  don't  know what t h
e  associati on i s the r oyal hangup. 
 
 

Co uld you please spell 
your mothe r 's  na me?
 
 
I think it was T E R E Z A .
 
 
And her  las t  na me?
 
 
H A L P E R T 
 
 
And your  fat her 's?  
 
 
My fathe r 's  na me was M enhir . I  h
eard it spelled as Menyhert the e ha
s an umlaut [acc
en t], Kat z  K A 
T Z.  And he wa s a very handsome
 l ooking ma n, a  rea lly 
beautiful fa ce.  He  wa s totally di ffer ent 
fr om my mo ther.  My mother wa
s st e epe d in t his quiet worl dl y 
knowle dge  and culti vati on of music  
and l iterat ur e and my fat her s hut  
all of that out entirel
y and wa s only i nt ereste d a nd focused in on  
Ha sidic  and Tal mudic matters a nd Tal mudi c wor l d.  
That wa s his worl d.  So 
they were really two 
opposit es , ye t gia nts  in their own r ight s
 
 
equally matched in 
level of intellect
 
 
Ye s the leve l of intellect  wa s on
 par  e vide ntly but  one  was  in 
total opposition 
to the other. 
 
 
What  ki nd of sc hooling 
did your mother have?
 
 
Proba bly public  sc hool  
and probably no
t mu ch schooling beca
use t hat  was forbidden also i n  that  
circle but  tremendous sel f educat
ion. That was probably on par w
ith any college ed
uction that we  
know. The  s ix chil dre n  who ca me  to
 this insane wo rld of Au schwitz 
and some  of us 
survived, then 
to A merica -  whatever  we are is 
w ha t  my  mot her  p ou r ed
 into us; not my father  at  all because we 
wer e not  i nt ereste d in hi s world bu
t  my  mo th er p oure d  so  mu ch int o 
us  that I  fee l  we  have had a n  
education on top of whatev
er little education was ava
ilable to people in our st
ation. It was so hugely 
enriched by my mother  
who endowe d us  with it , ne ver  st o
pped. I reme mber we  would ask her 
que stions  and s he  would sa y " H ow
 wo uld I know.  I wa s six year
s old a long time  ago."  Two 
mi nute s l ater  she ga ve t he  ans wer, of
 course.  She had the answer to 
al most  e veryt hing
.  We  all talk 
about her wi th such r ich memories
 a n d admi rati on and I a m s ure it 
i s justi fie d.  So ma ny people  
cannot be wrong.  So ma
ny people who still men
tion her with such reverence.  I personally was 

unque stioningly like  my fat her .  
Ther e was somet hing ab
out her and he wa s now
here near a s good  
and gentle as my  mo ther.  He  wa
s much rougher in ma ny
 wa ys but somehow I liked him.   I alwa ys 
had criticism fr om my moth
er but I didn't lik
e ma ny of the things, many 
of her ways, but I am my  
mother s  da ughter  a nd I  a m tr ying t o  ful fill  he r exp
ectations of me, al most  t o
tally ignoring what my  
father might have
 expected from us.  As 
a matter of fact I think al
l of us are fulfilling the 
expectati ons my mother had of us
 a n d tr uste d t ha t  we would come 
through with thos
e values that 
she poured into us that were so important to her.
  And I  t hink we di d come
 through intact al most  
wit h her val ues and her ideas ab
out life  both in humanitarian me
thod which was the number on e 
issue in her life  - to be an abso
lute humanitarian.  Alth
ough she was fully awar
e of the cruelties that  
ma n i s c apa ble of.  I  thi nk t hat   probably s he didn'
t know the details of Au
schwitz .  She ne ver  even  
hear d of Auschwitz because maybe 
i n this countr y there were head
lines in the New 
Yor k  Ti mes  b u t  
we  neve r he ard the  word Aus chwit z.  We  li ve d i n  
a t otally r epr essive count
r y where  fa sc ism wa s t he  
order of the day.  We didn't kn
ow anything.  We 
only knew what Hitler fe d 
us in the controlled  
pres s a nd the  controll ed r adio.  So we  ha d a bs olu
tely no way of knowing a
nyt hing a nd we  cert ainl y  
didn't know they were  burni ng pe opl e and beca use 
we were the la st c ountry oc cupie d, all t hos e  
years  pass ed us  by wit h depri v
ations.  We  did not ge
t enough potatoes or 
enough bread because  
Hitler stole everything fr om
 my country.  But we li
ved in our homes and we 
had no idea.  We never 
heard the word Wa rsaw gh
ett o,  onl y some  of t hese  pe ople  who 
were i n  leader sh
i p  posit ions  all  
over .  The world knew a great deal
 more t han we knew. We ar e ev
e n a ccus ed toda y.  Why didn't we 
do something?  Why didn't we  go
. Who knew anything a
nd cer tainly who woul d expect  t hat  the war  
is not  goi ng to end a nd we will  be
 ali v e.  We have suff
er ed deprivati ons , se parati on fr om my fat he r  
and e verythi ng sounde d terribl y om
i nous and fr i ghte ning from what  
we hear d of Hit l er 's speeches 
whi ch wer e  on incessant l y and that
 he hate s  the  J ews but
 none of that adde
d up to a crematorium 
and we knew that  cert ai n peopl e 
we re caught  and inter rogate d and be ate n .  We  hear d these  stori es 
fr om people  who pa sse d by tryi ng 
to escape from nei gh
bori ng countri es  whic h were  occ upi ed by 
Hitler, like Czechoslovakia and Roma
nia.  They passed 
through and told us 
some horror tales .  
Those people were
 interrogated but no one sa
id anything about people be
ing transported in cattle  
cars to anot her planet  named Ausc
hwitz and burned.  Wh en we  he
ard these gruesome st ories we 
wer e as incr edul ous as 
people are today when we  
tell t he m a bout t he  hol oca ust.  Who woul d beli eve  
it? 
 
 
What  ki nd of stories  di d you h
ear  from refugees?  Were they 
coming fr om Poland or Germany?
 
 
No  not from Poland or Germany.  They usuall
y  ca me  fro m S l o va kia  
and Cz echoslovakia and 
Roma ni a.  Thos e ar ound us
 who pa ss ed by managed t o e sca pe an
d they found a nice lodging in my  
ho me  b eca u s e my  mo the r  w a
s alwa ys in the forefront of aiding 
the disa dvanta ged. 
 So as chil dren 
we  listene d to some  of these ta
les but there were not 
t hat  many peopl e who es
caped and found their 
wa y to our home  and how 
mu ch do  children believe;
 t oda y t here  is  t elevi sion t o  s how the m what  
happe ns  in Ethi opi a and c hildr en st a r
ving and al l t hese  horr i bl
e things that are. 
 But at l east  it 's 
shown on TV.  It  is  mor e bel ievable
.  But  the n t h e ki ds go ba ck t o 
school and go and 
listen to their 

rock a nd r oll  musi c a nd fi gure  it i s far  awa y, it 's not  
where  we ar e; it 's not  goi ng t o ha ppe n to us ,  we 
are human beings.
 
 
Spe aki ng of school what kind of
 sc hools did you a ttend?
  Ca n you tell us s o me
thi ng about goi ng t o  
school  in Kis varda?
 
 
Yes, there was a Jewish element ary
 s chool  that  my fa m
ily wa s not  all o we d t o
 attend because my  
father was an anti-zionist. 
 And they taught  about  zi
oni s m i n  t he  Je wis h  sc hool. It 's  ki nd of cra zy. 
My father sent me to a 
non-J e wis h sc hool, t he  town
 ele me nta ry sc hool,t he n 
we  would go t o junior  
high there.  And it star
ts somewhere early.  
We  didn't go to gymnasium, 
but very few Jews at tended 
the gymnasium and it wouldn't  ha
ve  been pe opl e li ke  my fa ther
's  c hildr en be ca use  he  wouldn't  
allow us to go for that worldly 
education.  Wo  you kn
ow it starts 
some where after Junior High and 
ma ybe it  star ts ea rly enough, be for e e i ghte en.
 
 
Fourtee n or  s o?
 
 
Probably t h ere were some kind of cour ses t hat  
we were at tendi ng.  I r e me mbe r  that one ti me  
Hungary was friends with
 Italy when Mussolini 
was still the good guy a
nd there was something 
called Istituto Italiana di
 Cultura and we attended
 courses like th
at and there was a tremendous  
amount of self education and r
eading and a tremendous amount at ho
me  and my  mo ther's  prompting 
and the ki ds all were very interest ed in all of the 
worldly matters and that ki
nd of education went on 
in t he home forever.  Wh
en my father  went  to America we wer e
 a ble t o se nd Rac hel  to a  more ....
 
 
Rachel being your younger sister?
 
 
My younger  sister .  My fat her was no longe r the re 
so my mother was able 
to send her to furt her 
schooling.  I don't 
know how far she  got but then
 when it came to my younge
st si ster , Pot yo, it  was 
the antisemitism.  Wh en Hitlercame was at our doorste
p I know that she wa
s brutalized.  Her  
school life  was cut short wi
th real brutality.  I thin
k she was thirteen and a ha
lf when she was killed. 
I think she was thirteen 
in January and she wa s ki
lled in May in 1944.  Bu
t as she was going to 
school she was - I don't kn
ow a year or two, sometime before they
 deported us I don't have the time  
frame - she developed the - what is this thing you get?
 
 
Appendicitis?
 
 

Appendicitis, and she ha
d to be operated on. In 
those days an op
eration like that 
was a major event 
and you had to stay home at
 least six weeks after the operation. 
 I  don't  know how l ong she  was  i n  
the  hospit al  but  s he  ha d t o be  re move d fr om sc hool
 and ha d t o  ha ve  s urger y.
 When she was at home 
recoveri ng a nd was  getti ng very l one

school .  The y re fuse d he r.  She 
was  not per mitt e d to ree nter school
 bec ause s he wa s

 ti me  t hey got  rid of her  
and t hat  wa s a not her  Je wi s h

they don't ha ve t o ta ke he r bac k. 
 She wa s no longer in th

back and I reme mber the child su

my  mo ther  t hat  she  s ho uld  g o

and she was not  lear nin g  
anyt hing a n d all  he r frie nds  wer e  in school  a nd i t
 was a tragi c ti me. I n 
the end she wound up in 
Ausc hwitz a nd she ne ver  we nt bac k

fr om not  bei ng allowe d t o re enter

Je wis h kids  pr obabl y c onti nue d  
but this was a good wa y to
 get ri d of anothe r Je wis h c hild.  Th
ere is lots to sa

Pot yo who wa s trul y a child of wa
r, as we all were children of 
war , but none more t han she was  
because she was reall y born i nto 
t he war .  She wa s 13 yea r s ol d.  
I'm talking now ab
out 1944 s o s h e  
must ha ve been 
born in 1931.
 
 
Her name was?
 
 
Her  na me  was Helen but  we  cal led 
her Potyo that's  some  kind of 
endeari n g t er m for  I  don't  know  
"the little one"
 
 
The baby in the family?
 
 
Ye s, the baby in the fami ly. 
 
 
And t hat 's  s p elled?
 
 
POTYO O wit h an uml a ut [accent ]. 
 And she was a very be
aut i ful chil d and di ffer ent  fr om t he ot her  
children in my fa mily.  
Hitler was riding high al
ready when she wa
s growing up and 
she didn't even 
know anything else th
an a life  that is colore
d by Hitler and his sp
eeches and everyt
hing else.  She 
wa s a  di ffere nt kind of c h ild fr om 
t he  rest of us , tr e mendously  se
lf- centered and obviously a very 
intelli gent  child.  You know I have  gr eat pain t a
lki ng a bout her  eve n now 
a nd by now s he would be  
well over 50.  She wo uld be 
an ol d woma n an
d it  woul d....
 
 
Over 50, t hat 's not  ol d.
 

 
But to me  she is that  child, that
 bea uti ful 13 year  old l ean c hil d 
who evi de ntl y kne w not hi ng but  fear  
and love in her - this en
ormous love for the 
family and this
 fear of what Hitler'
s era did to her and 
the war  came.  She was 9 year s ol
d when the wa r br oke out
 a nd I  ca n onl y t hink 
of her as fe ar and 
love  and by fe ar  i  mea n  t he  fact  
t hat  she  wa s so t erri fied of bein
g torn away from the fa mi ly. She 
was already a tall
 little girl a normal not a 
little bit of a chil
d, but a growing 
little child and s h e 
insist ed on sleeping with my moth
er.  Wh en my fat her  l e ft  she al
ways slept with 
my  mo ther , b u t  
even when my  father was home she wa nted to sl
eep wit h my mot her be
cause she was afrai d. I 
re me mber I do not know if other 
me mb ers o f my  fa mi ly r e me mb er 
her cr ying out i n the mi ddle of 
the night having terrible
 dreams and it was H
itler, something about Hitler. 
 So this was a child of 
fe ar and l ove.  The  love  of her  
fa mil y wa s e nor mous  a nd I t hi nk 
her death might be some what the 
result of  her wa nting to be wi
th her mother because I am sure
 that she hung on
to  my  mo t her,  
wanted to go with her wherever
 s h e was goi ng and sure e n ough Me
nge l e di d as k her.  Fr om the  
account s I heard fr om my sist ers, 
my two sisters who wer e on their 
way t o  the cr emat orium because 
Mengela  pi c ked us out  s eparat ely. 
 He pi cked out Chi cha
 and my self first and 
my olde r sis t er, Ci pi ,  
and Rachel kept  going to the crematorium and th
en Mengel e turned aro
und the group and made 
another selection.  I think 
Rachel still to this da
y does not reme mb er if 
it was Potyo or she who  
answered Mengele's questio
n of "Du kleine, wie alt 
bist du?" and you little on
e, how old are you? 
And the indication 
wa s t hat he  as ke d her for  her  a ge t o cont
e mplate  to pi ck her 
out.  Ha d she said 15 
he pr obabl y would ha ve put her out 
to the life side but my sister R
achel does not reme mber i f it  was 
the chil d who answered, Pot yo, t hat
 s he was  only 13, not  sa yi ng t hat
 I am 13 and a 
half but  lying a 
half a year, or she, Rach
el, said it; and that sent
ence haunted, has been haunt
ing Rachel all her life  
and she still doesn't k
now if she said it or
 the child said it an
d she's never free of 
guilt and its been a 
terrible li fe for her because she ha
s been sufferi ng tremen
dously.  And Potyo wa nt
ed to go with my  
mother.   Whether Potyo was kille
d with my mother in 
the crematorium or wh
ether she was put in 
the open fire that they built 
in those days when 
t he  Hu n garia n Je ws  we
re  br ought  in.  The  
cremat oriums were working day 
and night i n Auschwitz and they
 burned accor ding t o  the Kap o  
who tol d us , who wa s there ma ny ye ars be fore .  Sh
e survived a number of 
year s.  Event uall y she 
wa s kill ed al so, but she t old us 
t hat never ha d she  seen in Aus chw
itz t his kind [ph 510 homa ge ] as 
when the Hungaria
n Je ws
 were  br ought i n.  
And whereas t h ey used t o 
burn 10,000 people a day 
they were burning 10 to 
24,000 people a day and the crematoriums
.  I think there we
re 5 of them. 
Four or  five  of t he m wer e not pr ove d sufficie nt en
ough for  the daily carnage 
so they bui lt open fires 
and evidentl y Elie Wi esel
 saw some of t hese live 
childr en bei ng thr o wn i n to
 t he fir es because ther e 
was no room in the crematoriums. 
 And I am still haunted
 because I don't now 
if Potyo because she 
wa s a child wa s thrown
 alive into the open
 fire or if she wa
s put into the cremat
orium but I do know 
this much that I saw the 
flames and I hear d the shr i
eks and it was obvi ous t hat 
in addition to the fire 
that was bur ning in the crematoriums  there was a
not her  fire  t o acc ommodate
 the extra world of the 
extra burden of Jews th
at  they felt  had to be bur ne d up so
 there  wa s a  lot  of l i ve bur ning. 
 
 
Do  you recall the date?
 
 

Oh yes  it wa s Ma y 31, 1944.
 
 
Just  a da y a ft er your  birthday?
 
 
No, we  left Kisvarda on the May 
29 and my  birthday is on May 28
 and that's  the day we  were  
pac king for what t hey
 ca lled t he de portation a nd 
we di dn't know what  the he
ll it meant, 
de porta tion.   
But  we  were  pa cki ng ge
tting ready for this.
 
 
Who or dere d you to pa ck?
 
 
Who ordere d us  t o  pa ck?   The  sixt e en ye ar  ol d SS
 who came into 
the ghetto of Ki
svarda with a 
silver pistol and a dog. 
 I guess a German Shepherd and this is the first time we saw the Germans 
because after that point Hitler 
marched into Hungary on March 1
9, 1944 Sunday afte
rnoon then in 
quic k s ucc es sion be cause  the y have  le arne d their ow
n method of ma dness by 
then so well of how to  
kill Jews.  First they 
started manually k
illing one by one then
 they developed 
these incredibly 
sophisti cate d  wa ys  of bur ning the m a n d ga ssing the m
 a nd bur ni ng the m a nd a
ll that, and by the time 
it came to Hu ng ary what they starte
d in 1939 what  the y  
started in Poland, le
t 's  sa y, e nde d up in 
Hungary as  a pus h butt o n s yst e m a n
d t hat 's how they were
 able to desecrate 
the Hungarian Jewish 
populati on i n a matter  of three we
eks I believe.  600,000 Hungarian 
J e ws I beli eve , it  wa s a  hi ghl y  
developed system. Bu
t Hitler marched in 
on March 19 1944 an
d probably about fo
ur weeks later, 
whi ch wa s t he day a f ter Pas sover t he y allowed us  
to stay in our homes on
 Passover, for Passover, 
and the day after Pa ssover we  we
re herded i nto the ghett o.
 
 
By the Ger m ans?
 
 
By the Hungarians.
 
 
By the Hungarians?
 
 
By the Hungarian Gendar me
s t he most cruel creat ure
s on the face of t he eart
h wit h thei r high hats 
and feat her s and ri
fles and shoulders.
 
 
No  Ger ma ns  in  Kisv ard a yet?
 
 

No.  It wa s the Ge ndarme s - the I don't reme
mber  muc h  activit y by t he police me n but  I  do 
re me mb er t h e Ge ndar me s . I  re me mb er
 cl early t wo Gendar mes t ook ea
ch family into
 the ghetto. 
The y  ca me  t o eac h home  -  t wo Ge nda
r mes - and deliver ed th
em into the ghetto wi
t h their fi fty kil os 
on the i r bac ks.  And we  di d not  s ee the Ger ma ns .
 Evi dently t he machiner y 
worked in such a wa y 
that t he  Ger ma ns  ha d no aut horit y on
 the fate of the Hung
aria n J ews until  just be fore  the de portati on  
and then they seemed to co-mi
ngl e wit h the Ge ndar me s -  the Gend
ar mes and t he Na
zis, the SS.  
The first time we saw th
e SS was on Sunday aftern
oon May 28, 1944,  on 
my bi rthday.  And he 
came in with the Gendar mes and they lined up 
all of the ...I re member
 this beau
tiful sunny 
aft ernoon in May and we 
were ordered out of our cramped quar
ters and I think in each courtyard  

they lined them up - I think the 
genda r me s did t hat  and the  ghet to
 poli ce and pe opl e who worke d i n  
the  ghetto i n  some  ki nd of lea der
shi p positi ons  -  a n d we  wer e  to a
ppe ar i n  the c ourt yar d a nd then the 
Naz i  c a me a nd he  announce d e ach na me.  As  he  
calle d out  t he na me s, the 
na mes that were calle d 
out  ha d t o  move  over  to t he other side .
 
 
How di d t he y know the na mes?
 
 
The names wer e collect ed well i n 
a dva nce by the Je wis h ma nage me
nt  -peopl e e vid
ently the Nazis  
had dealt wit h fr om Buda pest  thr oughout  th
e  c ount ry wit h t his .  They had va rious ..... 
 
 
Did you have a council?
 
 
Yea, they ha d a council I gue ss.
 
 
How far  bac k wa s t his council  se t up?
 
 
Oh thi s wa s aft er Hitl er mar che d i n but be fore  we
 were taken to the ghetto
 because this was whe n  
we  were  in our  home ye t.  And 
they ha d a n actual ce ns us t a ker 
-  one  or  two pe ople  assigne d for  
these  j obs .  Whet her  the y wer e pai d j obs , I don't  r e
me mber.  But I know that 
they ca me  to our home. 
They went  t o each home wi th a fo
rm and they listed each pers on living in that home .  So there was 
no esc ape  fr om t hat.  You c oul dn
't  li e a nd sa y Mrs. Ka
tz lives here but her 
children are not living 
here  - ever ybody wa s lis te d.  And 
they compiled this - it wa s a 
re gular  ce ns us  taking of Je ws .
 
 
Only of Jews?
 
 
Only of Jews, of course.
 

 
And no one  sus p
ect ed anythi ng?
 
 
No one suspected anything.  We  knew
 that Hit ler  is doi n
g his things but wh at 
this would result in,  
we di dn't know. Thi s wa s another 
cr aziness t hat we had t o
 comply with.  And 
a lot of the orders  
prior to taking us to the 
ghetto were handed down to
 us by a town crier in th
e center of town, in the 
circle; the town crier with his dr
um and his little funny 
hat and his uniform with
 a very im
portant air 
about hi m.  He wa s a n a bsol ute i diot  but he kne
w how to tap this out an
d how to r ea d enough to 
read the  or ders t hat c a m e to hi m fr om Buda pes t  
or fr om t h e council, ce
rtainl y fr om t he Nazi 
ma chi ner y.  And he would rea d out t hese  orders .  
Wh ether you were in the 
town square 
or not you 
had to know the orders.  Not knowin
g the la w wa s no e xc use of c our se
 like it isn't here either.  The  
kids  woul d r un home  and tell  their  parent s  that  t hes
e were the new orders an
d all that and then an 
hour later he  would appe ar agai n a
nd give out ne w order s - J ews cannot
 ha ve bic ycle s.  You have to  
take them into the town 
hall.  J e ws c an have no r adios. This 
happene d all  t he ti me  a nd larger  ne w s  
ca me fr om t he Fas c ist ne ws pa pers tha t  we were  sti
ll able to purchase in wh
ich they what  the Jewish 
star has to be ma de of - 
how many inches 
of the yellow star, wh
ich si de of the coat  you have t o wear  
it on.  All of these things
 came from t he news
papers and then th
ey were repeated 
by t he town crier  
and t he rest r ictions - ev
e r y mi n ute  s o methi ng  el se
 - every hour something 
else.  All of this was 
heralded through the radio while 
we still had the radio, before we
 had to turn it in - and the 
newspapers and the t o wn cr
ier .  We  were bombar ded wit h it  da y a nd ni ght .
 
 
You ha d t o move  out of
 your home , didn't  you?
 
 
We  did not  have  to move  out  of 
our  home  until  t hey to
ok us, unti l the t w o ge
ndarme s came  and took 
each famil y from t he ho me
 and took us to the 
ghett o and then we ...
 
 
So  you lived outside of the ghetto?
 
 
We  lived on the main
 stre et in a  pe r fec tly bea uti ful  home .
 
 
And you wer en't  force d t o
 move i nto t he ghetto?
 
 
Not  for - it happened so 
fast.  He  marched in Ma
rch 19.  I don't know wh en
 Passover  was then.   
 
 
Ap ril
 

 
We ll, we  ha d our  Pa ssover  at  hom
e and the da y after Pa ss over th
e two gendarme s 
came to each 
home with the list.  In this home in this addr e
ss these are t he number of 
Je ws who li ve.  And we  
wer e gi ve n order s t o ta ke 50 kil os  of our  best  
clothing and best food. 
Of course which the y  
confi scat ed i mmediat ely.  Th
ey ma de  us bring our fi ne
st  cl othe s for t he Ger ma ns .
 
 
So you br ought  your  be st  clot hes?
 
 
Oh absolutely.  I re me mber  what  
I  was we arin g  wh en  we  b o a rde d t h
e cattle car.  
I wa s wea r in g a 
bea uti ful  big fl owing cas hmere  c oat  wit h br own sue d
e pl atform shoes ma de  to
 orde r.  The y  were  
bea uti ful  a nd I had a  be autiful big handba g, beige , 
mat chi ng my c oat .  It wa
s summer.  It was May,  
it was hot but we didn't know wh
ere  we  were  goi ng.  We  da
r e d not  take our be st coat .
 
 
They didn't tell you wh
ere you were going?
 
 
Deport ation, to t he east .  Whatever
 that meant, we
 ha d no idea.
 
 
Do you recal l what  your
 mo ther  wa s wea r in g?
 
 
I"m afraid I don't but it seems 
to me that she was wearing a wi
g us ually, but t his
 time  she wa s 
wea ring a  ke rchie f on her  he ad ins tea d of weari n
g a wig and I reme mb er he
r frantically shopping for 
last mi nut e food.  They had kept  
the  Je wis h  food st ore s ope n until
 a  mi nute  be for e they took us 
awa y, te n o'cloc k in the  morni ng 
or whenever  they had to cl ose 
t he Je wi sh shops and I re me mbe r  
my  mot her s e ndi ng  me o ut to  the  sto r e.  Th at was  
very fancy, l i ke a  deli cat esse n ki nd of stor e right 
outsi de  of our c ourt yar d on the ma
in street.  And she sent me  out 
for a  quarter pound of butte r or  
something and I re member how th
e lady (by the way lived in our
 court y ard als o, the  pe opl e who 
owne d t he  st ore, a nd the y wer e ver y succ ess f ul 
and it was a very elegant  
s t ore.)  She  was c ounti ng 
the  pe nni es  how I  pai d  for t he  butter .  In t hat  res p ec
t it seems like insanity th
at I had to give every 
last pe nny t hat  the  butt e r was  pr
iced at  because I gu
ess she thought she  wa
s comi ng back.  Of 
course, she was killed im
mediately.  She was a you
ng woman.  Her husband 
and her two children, 
they were all  murd
er ed i mmediat ely.  And then t h e gendar
me s came  and rolled down the iron roller 
the way they used on the stores th
er e.  Shut t he st ores down.  Bu
t I  r e me mb er my  mot he r  we nt ou t 
to t he mar ket.  Ther e was a mar ket pl ace wher e you wo
uld buy li ve chickens, fr
uits and all  ki nds of 
things while they were 
available.  I clearly re
me mb er t hat my mot her
, a woma n who ca me fro m 
suc h a r eligious  bac kgr ound, we
nt  out  to the mar ket  a nd bough
t ha m be cause  s h e wa nted he r 
childr en to be well fed in 
t he trai n on that tri p  goi ng east b
ecause ther e was no 
use tryi ng t o be 
kos her  a nymore.  At  l east  to 
her it was more import ant that  
her children shoul
d have some  

nourishing food t han t ha t 
it shoul d be kos her .  I 'm not eve n s ure 
that  she ate it  but  I r e member t hat 
she bought ham for us - so
 t hat  we  woul d have a ha m sa ndwi ch on
 t he  tra in.  We  di dn't know then  
that it was a cattle car.
 
 
You expect ed t o travel
 in a passenger  coach?
 
 
We  had no idea because we
 didn't see these cattle car
s before they pulle
d up.  As a matt
er of fa ct we  
never  sa w t h e m until  t he y pulled up beca use  we  s at 
out  at  the  railroa d sta ti on on the  sa nd.  We  wer e  
kind of lying down an
d devast ated by heat  and t hir st and t h
en we were guarded by Germans and the 
gendar me s a nd e ver yone  wit h ri fle s a nd we j ust  c
oul dn't sta nd on our feet 
so we lay down  on our 
bac kpa cks .   The  i nsa nity be ga n but we didn't  know
 what  we  wer e  wa itin g  for  a nd  we  wait ed  all  th e  
way till the afternoon.  I think they
 took us away in 
the morning fr om the 
ghetto to the railroad  
station.  We  didn't know what we were waiti ng for.
  So we wer e at t he railroa d st ati on but t her e  
were no cars yet.  Ther
e were no trains.  And th
en these cattle cars pulled up.
  That's what we were 
waiting fo r all day, evidently.  
And the cattle cars pu
lled up and they shove
d us in and the little  
window in the cattle car 
was barred with iron bars
 and then we found ourselves 75 
or maybe more 
standing in this cattle car like sa
rdines.  And then
 the fu n began.
 
 
Thi s wa s when you we re separ ate d 
fr om your  ba ggage  at t hat  point?
 
 
No  we  were  separ a te d fr o m the  bag ga ge -  I  a m ta
l king now about  Kisvarda  
- we were not separated 
fr om our  baggage until  we arri ve d i n Ausc hwitz.
 
 
So the baggage went into
 the cattle car
s with you?
 
 
Yes and we were tryi
ng to sit on those baggages
.  I remember my
 mother was sitti
ng against the 
wall, the far wall of the cattle car 
on these baggages that
 we had arranged for 
her and she was sitting 
there with my sister, Poty
o, and my br other  ki nd of 
laid down i n fr ont of he r,
 he place d some  ot he r  
bac kpa cks  -  it was  50 ki l os  eac h of us c arrie d and 
he  laid them down.  But ther e wa s not enough  

room s o he l ay on top of that and 
we  sat on top of him,  so
rt of.  And of course 
t here  were  no s anit ary  
- there wa s some kind of a....
 
 
A barr el?
 
 

It wasn't a barrel.  It was somet h
i ng small er t han t hat.  That 's wh
at we used for 
a toilet and it was 
splashing all over
 
 
A be dpa n?
 
 
It wa sn't  a bedpan.  It was one of
 those big  [kubel] 80
3 we used to call it
, [k ubel]. Then it wa s 
splas hi ng all  over .  By t h is ti me 
the whole thing was out of this wo
rld.  People sc rea mi n g, a nd I ha d 
my period a nd I c oul dn't  cha
nge  my napki n, a nd peopl e wer e 
dying already and going mad.  
 
 
Did anyone  argue or  res i st i n  a
ny way before getting on 
the train?  I imagin
e the mo ment  you sa w 
these cattle cars, must have 
been a shock of some sort.
 
 
We  were surrounded by me
n with ri fles.  They al l wore ri
fles, the SS had 
the ----------[814] t hose 
pistols.  And all these aides,  
Hungarians and Ge
rmans, they were all we
a r ing ri fle s  and we  kne w  
they shoot i mmediat ely.  
You know i f your  s pine  wa s cr ooke d the y 'l l  s hoot  you.
 
 
So  you were too af
raid to complain?
 
 
Oh  there was no way to oppose, 
t o  do anyt hing beca use  t hese  we
re not fi ghters.  These were  
childr en a nd ol d people .  The young 
me n were all taken away
 long befo re into th
e labor battalions . 
And these were all young
 people and wo me n and ch
ildren and old and sick. 
 Wh at we re you going 
to fi ght with?
 
 
Your enti re famil y?
 
 
The six of us.  The six children 
and my mother. My father was alr
eady in Ameri ca .  But  my brot her  
did try, fought t he  be st  he c oul d.
  He  went  over  t o t he  Nazi  a t  
one of the stops, when we  were 
already choking because there was 
no air through that barr
ed window, and he  trie d t o ma ke  a deal  
with hi m to take off the bars so that more air woul
d come in.  I think that 
t h ere was one at this end 
and one at t h e other e nd, I don't re
me mber.  And he trie d t o pr y it I 
think with his ha
nds apart to get  
some air.  And as the tr
ai n st opped he  dare d to go over to t he 
Nazi and offer hi m so
me  kind of bribe 
and for some  reason I seem t o re me
mber, but he could tell you this 
bett er,  t here was s o me  ki nd of a 
scissors they needed, or somethin
g or ot her, I wi sh yo
u woul d c hec k wit h hi m.  He  gave t he m a  
sciss ors  or  s o methi ng and t he n  he
 di dn't  ke ep his  promis e.  He 
wa s  going to pr y the  window open 
but he didn't  kee p his promis e.  He t o ok t he scis sors
.  I don't know if I'm te
lling you t he  stor y ri ght . 

It 's  some thi n g t hat you might  want  to
 chec k wit h hi m.  But  he  fought  
to get  us air, I know t hat .  He  
fought  as  be st as  he c oul d.  And t h
e rest of us I guess want 
to stay alive until we 
fi nall y a rrive at t his  
"east"  pl ace that we are deport ed to
 and wh ere the fa mi lies 
will be togeth
er  we heard. 
And they will 
have good tr eat ment .  We will  wor k
 for t he war effort but  we will  
be treated well.  We  heard these 
talks somew here along that
 we will be treated well 
and work for the war effo
rt and fa milies will be 
toget her .  So all we wanted t o do
 is arrive at thi s precious pl ace,
 you see, thi s east  where we are  
deported to and the fa milies
 wi ll be  together.  So lets get this in
sa ne  trip over wit h  be ca use  a ft er  thi s  
ever ythi ng will  be  all  r i ght .  An
d after that , two days later, we 
arrived at someplace that  sai d  
Au schwitz M[861].  And we  had no
 idea what t hat  meant .  And 
t hen it  all  bega
n, you know. 
Mengele and the crematoriums  and the whole thing but
 you pr oba bly don't  wa nt  to hear  a bout  that . 
You have enough of that. 
All over.  My mother, 
I reme mber, sitting thr
ough those two days from 
Monday afternoon 
through Wednesdayafternoon.
  That 's how long the trip took.  She sat against 
that wall cuddling my 
little sister and her eyes
 were filled with perception 
of this thing th
at we are in 
and t hat  we are goi ng t o  and ther
e  was no que sti on that she  kne w in
 her  s oul  wha t  i s happe ning.  
She knew that this is the fi nal roa
d, t h e fina l trip, t hat t h
is will result in deat
h.  I don't know how s h e  
coul d have known there was a crem
at orium or a gas c ha mber but i n 
her soul it was obvious  that s he  
kne w ever yt hing and t he r e was onl y 
one pra yer i n he r eyes a s she kept l o oki ng a t  he r childr en t hat  
they should surviv
e this, that they
 should outlive this ma
dness because ther e is 
a world out t her e t hat  
has humanity still locked in so
mewhere and this is 
a passing madness of a 
madman but there is 
goodness  a n d t here  is  di gnit y and 
there is life and there is purpos
e and man ha s a  mi nd wit h whic h 
he c an crea t e wondr ous things and 
we should l ive  up to those  i ma g
es  in he r he ad, thos e  idea s t hat 
she had rat h er than what  the mo me
nt  is whi ch is evidentl y t he  ugli e
st part of humanity and that we 
have to go beyond that
 and look for that in 
man whic h is  noble  and 
cre ative  and good and ha s  
intellect of mind.  All of
 t hese thi ngs were writt en in her eye.  She spoke to us 
sil ent ly.  She kne w 
everything.  I re
member her having kind 
of a resigned look.  
I will not live but re
member that there 
is s o muc h t o li ve for  and you all  
should live for what can be not  what  
is now here in fr
ont of us.  To 
me it was unmistakable that she 
never stopped transmitting these mess
ages while she was rocking in  
that hideous cattle car.  Th
at car was jerking like this.  I just ha
ve no doubt about it 
that she spoke to 
us all the time without 
sa ying a nyt hing.  And I t hi nk her  le ga
c y wa s hear d by us  a nd underst ood and 
in some  my sterious way it added to 
the effo
rt that we  ma de  to stay
 alive.  Ha d we  not come  fr om 
such a noble heart  as she ha
d I  don't  know i f  we  woul d ha ve  be en ab
l e t o  make  that ki nd of e ffort  t o  
survive.  But ther e's no question 
that she  ha nded down 
that l e gac y.  Now you 
c an sa y this about  all  
mothers, that their love carried
 through those wh
o survived and they reme
mbered their mo ther's  
legacy.  This is th
e way I have to talk
 about my mother b
eca us e s he ha d s u ch l argnes s i n her hear t.
 
I c an't  put it any othe r wa y exc ept  t hat  for two days  
she fe d us her vision of 
a humanity that 's greater 
than what Hi tler has creat ed.
 
 
It se e ms l ike  she had t wo visions , t he  vision of 
de a th a nd the vi sion of 
the triumph of
 huma nity.
 
 
She had the vision of her own li
fe  a nd the  tri u mph of huma nit y.
 

 
Wa s she  t he onl y pers on i n your c ar 
to imagine that  this was the end?
 
 
No, I s houl dn't t hink s o.  I don'
t know if we saw it as the end. 
 Re me mber we were young and 
healthy and not willing to bow ou
r head to Hitler. 
 There is the fi ght
ing spirit
 for you.
 
 
Determination?
 
 
Yeah, we were not willing 
to accept Hitler as 
the last word.  Th
ere is something el
se out there and 
we're going to destro
y this Hitlerism, this Hitle
r world when we're fr ee an
d we can add our voice to 
those who cr eate a bett er  wo
rld.  An d I guess we  always tried.  
We heard.  After all 
it's that spirit 
that  moved me t o wheel  the stro
ll er  through t he  Wa shi ngt on mar c
he s  in t he Vi etna
m days. I took 
bot h my kids, my husba nd 
and my t wo ki ds  a nd we prot este d t h
e Vi etnam war.  It
 was t hat sa me  
spirit  tha t  we  ha ve  
to fight for a better 
world, and I fought .
 
 
We re there discussions in the tr

ons amo ng the vari
ous families? 
You pr oba bl y kne w  s o me of the othe r pe opl e.
 
 
The r e wa s n o wa y t o
 get to anybody.
 
 
No, wit hi n your  cattl e c ar .
 
 
Yes but within the cattle car
 there was no way 
to move to the other end of
 the cattle car 
so we were  
in this spot, in this tiny little spot, 
t he seve n of us a nd you couldn't e ve n 
go to the left or to the right. 
There wa s no room.  
 
 
But  you re cogniz ed some  of the  ot her  people?
 
 
I don't reme mber anybody 
or anything.  I onl
y remember this
 little group huddled to
gether trying to 
ma ke  it t hrough t he night .
 
 
Very little talking?
 

 
Reme mber the clatte
ring of the cattle 
car is very noisy.
 
 
Pra yers?
 
 
I don't reme mb er praying.  I'
m sur e  pe opl e wer e pr ayi ng but I  re me mber hea r ing screa ms  a nd  
nightmarish screams of all kinds. 
 Pe ople were going ma
d and people were dyi
ng, a nd t he moa ns  of 
the sick.  Who can ever descr i be th
at  kind of ri de .  You 
know it is very hard to
 tell after so many  
years  but  I t hink we  wer e  
fo cu sed  in  on  my  mot h er 's
 s oul  a nd that  s oul  must ha ve  be e n i nce ssa ntly  
fe eding us messages of life
, not death.  That's  how 
I see it.  You will talk 
to my br ot her  and I  don't  
know what he will say but th
is is my inner interpre
tation of that trip.  No
, we didn't 
see anybody.
 
 
It was  da rk, wa sn't it?
 
 
Of course  it  wa s dark.
 
 
You ha d no windows.
 
 
No  light.  Who could 
hear  fr om t h e scream
s  a nd the tr e me ndous  nois e of
 the rattling of the cars. 
You couldn't he ar your own voi ce
.  You c oul d only he ar your 
i nne r voic e which ga ve  you a  
mandate to live or end it
 right here - let me die 
or go on.  Philip was an
 extraordinary force of 
strength.  He wa s all of 19 or 
20, 21 and he knew that
 he was the man in the family that  he's 
responsible  a s
 
like he was the father 
of these six women.  He wa
s just great.  He 
always has been.  
He is still the 
father of us all.  He is
 treating us  as if we  are hi s children an
d  t hat  my  mo th er or
dered him to shield 
her  chi l dre n.  And he  wa s s hiel di
ng us all the time and 
he  trie d.  How he  ma
naged to talk to the 
Nazis, I don't know, but he trie
d to do some  kind of negotiation. 
 His  story mi ght be  ent i rely  
di fferent than mine but these ar
e my  inner interpretations of wh
at my  mother was and my  baby 
sister  who c oul dn't breat he.  Proba bl y wouldn't  l e
t he r fi nge r  go. She mu st 
have  he ld on to my 
mother  wit h her entir e body and ever ything
 wit hin her.  My ol der si ster , Cipi
 
she was one of these suffering mo
re grown children beca
use there were only 
the two little ones and 
my brot her  who was  shi elding ever
ybody and t he n t here  were  the  t hree  gr own girl s a n d s he  had th e  
bewildered protecti ve look about he
r i f I can remember.  But she wa
s ver y prote ctive al so, al wa ys . 
She  was a ve ry good-hear ted woma n 
who had a te nde nc y to speak fir st 
and think about it later.  But  
the first instinct  was al ways good 
- to be good.  I reme
mbe r  w h en  so me b od y ca
me  into our house as 
they ofte n did, t he gyps y lady wh
o had nine [ph] 1048 mil l i on ki
ds  and she woul
d c o me to  my  

mother  and say my chil dren are hu
ngry a nd my mother  woul d pac k  
thi ngs i n  he r pot a t o sac k  that  
she came wi th.  My ol de r si ster ha d a tremendous 
a mount  of goodness  i n  he
r.  I reall y  reme mber 
one Friday t he l ady came 
fr om a ver y povert y ri dden ar ea of t o
wn - a Je wi sh woma n a nd sai d that  
it 's al rea dy Friday a fter noon a nd sh
e does n't ha ve fish or chicke n or
 l argeness (shabbat br ead) .  She 
doesn't have it because she doesn't ha
ve a pe nny a n d it 's getti ng too la
te in the afternoon and she still 
doe sn't have anyt hing for  the sha bbat.
 
They were  so religi ous  that even if they had someth
ing on s h abbat t hey woul dn
't cook it so it had to  
be Friday afternoon.  And I clearly 
re me mb er  t hat  my  old e r  sis t er ha
d a gol d r i ng wit h  her na me  i n  
it.  I don't remember
 what they cal led it
 but it was ver y fashi ona ble  in
 those  da ys  tha t you would  
have a ring with a kind of circle
 her e and your na me was i m printe
d i n it and she ha d this gol d ring 
that s he 's got ten for a birt hda y or s o mething or ot he
r and when she hear d t hi s 
lady c o me and cry that  
her chil dre n are hungr y, she does n't  have a nyt hing 
for t he shabbat, she j u st
 took off her ring and 
gave it to the woma n.  She was 
extremely good-hearted an
d she acted upon the 
first impulse.  She 
thought about it later 
but s he woul d al wa ys  act  i m
me diately and some  of her 
acts were acts of native 
goodness.  I was so focuse
d in on my little si
ster that outside of the st
rength of my si
ster Chicha 
who after all is responsible for our 
survival , ther e is no questi on ab
out that.  I reme
mber her for her 
strength and I re me mber  my br othe r for hi s bi gne ss 
not even all of this wo
rld but also of another  
world of great ideals, goodnesses.
  I was duly fo cused 
in on the little one most
 but I remember my  
older  si ster .  The r e wa s al wa ys  so
me  kind of envy beca use  s he had 
the best  clothes and she was t he 
one  t o be  married off and she  wa
s very elegant and very well  ke
pt and you had to
 pay homage to 
this ol der sis t er al wa ys .
 
 
How ol d wa s s he?
 
 
She  must ha ve bee n 26, 27, 28, s o me th
ing li ke  tha t .  She  was  a grown wo man.
 
 
But not marr ied?
 
 
Not ma rried because there we re no
 me n around.  They 
were  all in the Munkaszolgalat, the labor 
battali on.  But I  re me mber her  mos t  for her  deter mi n
ation to live.  She wa s 
the one, of course, who 
didn't  survi v e but  I  clearl y r e member  in t he second
 camp, not in Auschwitz 
but in Birnbaumel wh en 
she was wearing this blanke
t ,  some  kind of blanket t hat  we  ha d 
and we t or e t o pieces and each one 
wore a not he r part  of the  blanke
t or s o meti me s we ha d a  whole bl
anket and she wa s bundled up in 
this bla nket ,  fr oze n t o death i n
 the January snow and frost of 
Eastern Germany wh
ich is like the 
North Pole.  I just reme
mber her sta ndi ng wit h t hat blanket  
on, wei ghi ng pr ob
abl y 50 pounds , a 
fr ozen skeleton that's 
still alive.  She said to me
 armless, legless, but I want
 to survive. Even if my  
ar ms freeze off and my 
l egs freeze off, no 
matt er ho w  muc h  o f  me  is  le ft
, I want  t o li ve, I wa nt  t o  
survive.  It ma de  a tremendous 
impression on me becaus
e I didn't think 
of her as deat
h.  I thought 
that she would be mo re depressed 
be c a use  I  re me mber  at  one  ti me  
that she had a fa
ile d l ove  stor y 

wh ere one of these me n who came  to
 my town with this labor batt
alion and she was 
in l ove  wi t h  
one  of them and then they took hi m away.  The w
hole  thi ng buste d a nd s h e was  terri bl y depr esse d. 
This was when we were s
till at home.  She felt like
 life was not worth livin
g without him.  I don't  
re me mb er  hi s na me .   B ut  s he  lo ok ed
 like she just doesn't 
thi nk li fe  i s  wort h l i vi ng wit h out  hi m.  I  
reme mb er I wa s surprised she was so tre mendously 
pr o-li fe , how she wa nted 
to live, even if only  
part  of her  i s  whole .   
And she's the one who 
didn't  ma ke  it .  That muc h  ca
n be said fo r determination 
and human spirit.  It's
 just another indication that
 there is absolutely no wa
y to tell - you 
ca nnot  tell  
what made one sur vive.  There ar
e no rules to this ga
me  that  ca n be detec t e d by any nor mal  huma n  
being and while psychiatrist
s make these idioti
c utterances that survivors 
guilt I am sup
posed to be 
fe eling.  On top of ever
ything I carry in my batt
ered heart I am 
supposed to be 
feeling guilty for  
surviving.  Survivor s' guilt.
 
I have  never  yet  be en a bl e t o co
nsci ously put  my fi nge r on t ha t  pr
onounce me nt  be caus e I  fe el gui lt y 
about everything I do 
today; if I say a cross word 
to my husband, if I mistreat my children, if I insult 
anybody, i f I ' m not ki nd, if I ' m not se nsiti ve a nd G-
d knows I am sure I do th
ose t hings.  I feel ver y 
guilt y a bout thos e things but I  ha ve ne ver c onsci ou
sly fe lt guilty about surviv
ing.  When I hear  the se  
learne d pronounce me nts and t he se ps
ychi atrist s se e m t o know so we
ll why we sur vived and how we  
survived and what we  feel
 and all  t hat.  What comes t o mi nd i s
 always what Golda 
Meir said once, I 
heard her on television
, who said that she feels 
guilty not because I didn't 
do everything within my  
power  but  because I  wa
sn't  t here.  So I  was ther
e.  I  have no r eason t o 
feel guilty.  If t here is a  
survivors' guilt, it's myst
erious to me.  Maybe th
ey know something that 
I don't know but I didn't  
kill six million people.
 
 
You didn't ki ll anybody.
 
 
I didn't  kill anybody.  
I didn't kill my mo ther.  I didn't send my
 family to the crem
atorium.  Hitler 
did.  I can't see why 
I  fe el guilt y.  I fe el guil t
y about all kinds of other th
ings .  I  t hink I  fe el ver y  
guilty about the fact that 
what this whole exper ience
 left me with 
is that I ma y have treated my  
childr en i n t he wa y not other  pe opl e  treat t heir c h
ildre n but wit h mor e wo
rryi ng, mor e caution, and 
infinit ely more a nxi ety t han nor m
al pare nts who have not ha d my ex
perience.  I think that in that  
sens e  I  ha ve  victi miz ed my chil
dren.  I think there is no questi
on in my mind th
at children o f 
survi vors ar e  dee ply wounde d by th
e experiences of their 
pa re nts a nd t he y refus e to a d mit it but  thi s 
tre mendous  drive  t o e xce l, not hing
 l es s than Har va r d woul d do for 
some  of t he m i s al wa ys ma ki ng 
up for t he pa in and depr i vation t hat t he pare nts have
 e xperie n ced.  I t hink our
 chil dren are in some 
wa ys  mor e s ensiti ve  be ca use  of t he t al es t hat  the pa
rent s have t old the m but  it 's a ver y c o mplic ate d  
issue of guilt between the parent and the child.  Th
ey feel guilt y for  what  ha
ppene d not out of t heir  
volition.  It's not their fa
ult, but what happ
ened to their parent was so
mething far more gruesome 
than happened to any other parent
 unl ess  in indivi dual  c ases  t h ey ha
ve  hi de ous  e xpe riences.  But  o n  
the whole t h eir par ent s have e xperie n ced horr endous 
grue some ness  in li fe.  Two r eally great vi cti ms  
of this outside of those of us 
who survi ved - because 
those  who peris he d ar e 
no longer  e v en victi ms ,  
they're just nothing anymore, bu
t we are t he li ving victi ms.  I 
thought the t w o real ly innocent  
victi ms are our chil dren and thei r children - t h
e perpetrators - the Na
zis whose children and  

grandc hildr e n have  t o li ve wit h 
t his  knowl edge t hough 
t hey don't  know anyt hing us ually bec ause 
their parents won't te
ll them.  But they 
suspect  it .  Maybe  my father  i s
 a mu rderer.  And which child 
wa nts  to be  fathere d  by a  
murderer.  Afraid to ask,
 they don't  get any answer
s.  Ge nerall y, I  s uppos e  
that 's what happens.  And I used 
t o say that they're the tr ue vi ct
ims, those childre
n and ours.  And 
then I've had quite a numb
er of terri bl e exper iences 
with German children an
d I stoppe d sayi ng tha t  
and I s ay it 's  onl y our  children who 
are the real vi cti ms.  It 's not 
quite true probab
ly because there 
are probably a lot of se
nsitive German kids who ar
e suffering tremendously. 
 But I had two or three 
lous y experi ence s, s o I s topped s ayi ng it .  I  j ust  
focus i n  on t he fact  t hat
 our children are terribly 
punished e motionall y by being tr uly t he e xte nsion 
of Au schwitz because wh
en we are  gone, long 
after we are gone, when none of 
us will be left, perhap
s decades later,
 these children
 will be the 
nearest  thi ng that you can touch t hat
 is connected t o Ausc
hwitz.  It is them th
ey will ask how was it 
to gro w  u p wit h a  mot h er wh o wa
s a survivor of Auschwitz.  You 
know I'm talking 
50 years fr om 
now.  I  expect t hat  our  
children should live longer 
than we live in our age.
  But you know, 20, 30, 
40 ye ars  fr om now t her e  will  be  
not hing as  comnmonly vi si ble  as  it
 is  t oda y that  you c an fi nd a  
survivor here and there.  So they will be the ne
ar est li nk t o t h e realit y of
 Au schwitz.  I don't envy 
them.  As  a matter of fact I have
 noti ced i n some of these gat h erin
g that we ha ve ha d i n Isr ael, in 
Wa shington, in Philadelphia
, the  s urvi vors , t hat the  media  was  kind
 of wise to that
 realit y beca use  I  
have noti ce d  how the y  
go after our child
ren rat her t han us.  It 's as i f
 we were alread
y gone and let's 
better  as k those  who will  be  here  w
ith us for a long time, 
their children.  
Who knows what 
it is to be  
the child of such a person
.  I want to hop back to
 some of the antise mitism th
at I grew up with that 
was really mother
's milk to me.
 
 
Bei ng a Je wi sh girl  in a 
Hungaria n school  in l933?
 
 
Ye s.  First of all I 
had to be sort of the best 
st udent because I was this terri
bl e  minority of one  or  t wo 
there.  I think there were 
two of us in the cl

This Jewish friend of mi ne.
 
 
Did you have any non-Jewish
 friends in t his class?
 
 
None t hat I  coul d tr ust .   I mi ght  have had so
me super fi ci al friends .  
I mi ght ha ve ha d, but I  
reme mb er this one.  Leah, I don'

- wa s her na me  
but her second

d her  fat h er was  e qual l y...
 

 
Not related to you Halper t?
 
 
No, not  at  a ll.  But her  fat her  wa
s so terribly religious,
 as  mine, a nd di d not  
wa nt he r to go t o a  
Jewish school which wo uld teach he

e  wa s ver y  bri ght  a nd s he  wa s  
a good friend of mi ne and she wa
s de cent  and darl ing and i ntel ligent  
and the two of us just simpl y  
had to be the be st st ude nts.  Bu
t  you c oul dn't win beca use  you ha d 
to be  the be st st udent  be cause  
you were s u ch a mi norit y and i f you wer e the  be st

just a da mn J ew who wa s s m

Was this all girls?
 
 
No , i t  wa s a  mi xed  cla s s .
 
 
Boys  and gir l s.
 
 
Yea h.  Thes e ver y sa me  kids  that I 
was in sc hool i n the a ft ernoon i f 
I walked out later 
in the stre et, I 
just heard them say, "Dir
ty Jews, dirty Jews, dirty 
Je ws ."   Yo u c a n 't be a win ner  whi c h is  wh at I  
apply as well to the fact 
that we cannot win this ug
ly reality of our life  that
 we are survivors of this 
ma dness  bec ause  vis-a - vi s our  c hildre
n.  We  ca nnot wi n be
cause so many of us 
have shielded them 
fr om Aus c hwitz .  We  di d not  wa nt  t o t e ll  the m a nyt
hing about it.  So there 
were those parents.  And 
they were l o sers be
cause the kids came 
back at them.  Why didn't you te
ll  me?   I know my niece  did 
and so di d ot hers .  I had t old t he m
 and my husband was ve
ry helpful and tried to impart some of the 
information because they we
re seeking it out.  But 
I must tell you they want
ed to know it and they 
didn't .  Earl y in t heir li ves they were al ready torn
 by conflicts because t hey
 wanted to know so much 
but t hey did not wa nt to know 
so much.  I cl ear ly 
re me mb er  wh en my  c h
ildre n wer e  goi ng t o  
school , thi s Fiel dst one we just 
me nti o ned, a nd we wer e  walki n g di
stance fr om the sc
hool.  We  lived  
in ov er t her e .  I  re me mb e r  my  older  o ne Pe ter  
who said one  morni ng, " M
ommy, how did my  aunt 
die? ", re ferri ng t o Potyo.  The y h
ear d that  maybe she died 
in an open fire alive they threw her in. 
Mommy how di d my aunt di
e, Pot yo?  And I  real ized that as 
he asked me  the  que
stion he had hi s 
hand on the knob.  He was openi ng 
t he door t o le ave for sc hool.  So he wants t o know but he di dn't  
really want  t o know and he le ft
 wit hout fi ndi ng out.  But t his t e
rrible conflict was already imbedded 
in there at su ch an early age so  
the end result is that there are no winners in imparting the knowledge 
or not.  Those of us who 
did lost in a sense and th
ose  of us  who didn't  l ost . 
 There 's  no wa y to win 
somet hing as  bi g a s
 t his , you c annot .
 
 
I would i ma gine  too t hat  you foun
d it difficult to think of Potyo 
as an aunt, thirteen years old.
 

 
Clearly, sur e.  That 's a ver y 
good poi nt.  As a matter  of fa ct 
when I  was sayi ng aunt I wa s  
wondering who I was 
talking about because she wa
s just a child.  But ind
eed she  was my c hildr en's 
aunt .  And woul d have be en a l ovel y wo
nder ful  a unt  of so me fi ft y odd yea r s.
 
 
Not  t o me nti on a bea uti ful wi fe and a  great  mot her .
 
 
And a mot he r  her sel f, yea h.  There 's  
not e ven a ny poi nt t o tal k about t h
at.  But in that 
same vein as I 
mentioned some further antis
e mitic winds that I got - 
 
 
In Hungary?
 
 
Yea h, I  must  tell  you the  story t hat  pa ined us , or  
paine d me, I  don't  know i f t he  ot hers  know it  t h e  
same  way.  But the way I 
know  the story of my  two brothers, 
twins, their names 
wer e  Sh mu el  a n d  
Barr y.
 
 
Barr y?   Coul d you s pell  it , pleas e.
 
 
I don't know how you would spell it
 but it was Beryl and Shmu el.  
That  would be t h
e Yiddish name.
 
 
Woul d t hat  be Sa muel?
 
 
Sa m would sound ri ght  and ma ybe  Ber nar d.  But 
I don't  remember their 
non-Jewish names though 
they had the m be cause they ha d t o be
 registered by their non-Jewish name s.
 
 
So you ha d t hree  br others , t hen?
 
 
I originally had three brothe
rs.  I don't reme mber - it
 seems to me yes, they were born be fore Potyo. 
They woul d come bet w een Rachel  
and Portyo.  They wer e not i de n
tical twins.  
They were two 
delicat e lit tl e boys t hat  I remember  in t heir  swa
ddli ng clothes.  I  di dn't know a bout this be cause  
something evidently happened an
d t hey shipped us  a wa y fr om 
home and they sent us to my 
grandmot her  in 
 

Nyi regyhaza.  When we
 ca me bac k we found t hat  
we  only had one brother out
 of the twins left.  My 
mother was kind of totally dest
royed.  And t h ey wer e tell ing 
us that we  came  home because 
somet hing te rrible had ha ppe ne d bu
t we 're goi ng bac k to my grandm
ot her  and the n we 'r e goi ng t o  
come back 
home agai n. 
 
The y s ent us  bac k a nd we didn't come bac k a gai
n because somet hing ter ri b
le happened again and 
what happened was that t he t wi ns 
had a wet nur se and the  wet nurs e 's 
child got ill with
 some kind of 
lung inflammation of some  sort - I don't know what
 it was, maybe TB for a
ll I know - but her milk  
was infected wit h whatever t his
 wa s  and her  chi l d rec overed.  She  was breas t - fee ding the thr e e  
children.  Her child got 
ill and recovered and our 
two children got very 
ill.  My parents had a 
philosophy in life when somethi
ng is wrong, when some body is ill
, you seek out the best possible 
care at any cost or any re
ligion or any anti-se
mitism, no matter what it is
 you will get the very best 
care.  So you go t o the 
mo st fa mo us  man i n t he field.   The  mo
st fa mo us ma n i n th
e fi eld, evi dentl y, 
was in this children's ho
spital which wa s very fa mous in the 
country, in De brecen which wa s near 
the t o wn where my mo
ther was born.  My mother  and father  
imme diately took the 
children to this 
hos pital .  One died a nd my 
mo th er  ca me  ho me ,  I  t hin k,
 to sit shiva.  
You know what th
at is, I think. 
After  the  de a d, you have t o sit for 
a week on t he fl oor , and t hat  sort of
 t hing.  It was the t i me before 
the chil d died t hat they sh
ipped us off to my gr andpa
rent s.  She evidently left  the other child there ill 
in Debrecen.  And I guess 
left the other child there and a we ek 
later or so the ot
her  child died as 
well .  And s o mebody, I don't
 remember who, told us 
that  when the ot her child
 died my mother left  
the hospit al and char ged out t o  th
e street absol ut ely crazed.  She 
wa s scr ea ming.  
She was totally 
craze d by i t .  And the n sh
e came home and fi na
ll y we  he ard the  stor y of wha t  ha ppe ne d a nd she  wa s  
absolutely convinced or she had 
facts, I don't know, because con
ceivabl y she  had fr iends.  M y  
mother  was  a ve ry soc i al  per son t o whom pe opl e talk
e d.  She  had real  frie nds . 
 In any fie ld, people  
she  touc hed truste d her  a nd confi ded
 in her  and e veryt hing.  So I  s u
ppos e she  must ha ve hear d thi s  
fr om ot her  doctor s, young 
doctor s, pe rhaps Je wish do
ct ors, coll eagues of -  t her
e were a lot of people 
involved evi dentl y in t h e t w o cas
es of death of these children. 
 And my  mother  wa s absolutely 
certai n that the chil dren were victi ms of ant ise
mitism; that they
 had e xperi me nt ed on the m a nd 
treated them as Je wish children,  not
 nece ssaril y  t o be  s ave d, but  t o 
learn from.  And that they were  
sacrificial lambs.  She ne
ver re cant ed on t hat.  She mai ntai ne d fo
rever that the child
ren were victims 
of anti-semitism.
 
Bac k i n thos e ye ars, whi ch goe s way bac k, I do
n't remember when t hose 
childr en wer e born, but  
this was before Hitler.  But cu
riously the place, the 
hospital, was known fo
r a sense of anti-
semitism.  So it wasn't he
r imagination.  She either
 had proof of it because th
ey were twins that they 
were a subject fo r experime ntation.
 
 
How ol d wer e they?
 
 
The y were e i ght  months  old whe n t h
ey di ed, within two, three weeks 
of ea c h ot her .  Of cour se my 
parents could never be  consoled and that's
 how Philip remained 
the only son after th
at.  My mother's 
instincts were to be trusted on th
e whole in all  of the bi g i ssues.

Do  you believe in G- d, Isabella?
 
 
No.  I  ha ve  ha d t r e me n dous t r o

of G- d beca use  I  never sa w hi m whe n I  
needed hi m and I really have ques

of them.  Ho w 
can I have any answer to them when I reme mb

evidentl y pl anes wer e fl ying over

anes that were going to takes 
pictur es  of t he Kr upp [Buna ] i nstall me nts .  Those a r

 of Auschwitz itself.  
The  all i es  ha ve ha d t hose  pic t ure s and the y  di dn

Wh ichever planes t hey were, I re

by the bombs  of t he  west

whatever I might have said
 - I don't remember - but 
I'd rather die by
 the bombs than 
let Hitler have 
the joy of killing me in th

 the last  word.  I really want ed to

Even G-d has to forg

that question .  Wh ere wa s G- d when the smoke was so

My sister .  My good sist er.  I go
 back to Chicha but I 
must  tell  you about  my 
pessi mi sm I start ed out  
wit h.  My mother  was so accur a
te in her pessi mi sti c outlook 
vi s-a-vis Jewi sh sur vival.  
 
 

She  wa s al so  op ti mistic , r e me mbe r ?
 
 
Ye s, bec ause  she hoped t hat her  chil dren woul d li ve
 and she expected them to
 live.  But my mother, 
throughout t he  war  ye ars  whil e Hitl er  was  ma king 
hi s big noi s es and big move s and wa s dancing all 
over  our  gra ves  all  over  Eur ope, e ve n be fore  the  wa
r broke out in the 30s wh
en I  was old 
enough to 
remember, my mother used
 to say (all the ti me I 
heard this) Hitler 
will lose the wa
r (there was no 
war yet) - Hitler will lose the 
war but he will win 
it against the Jews.  
Nobody put it more 
accur atel y, more ast utel y 
 
than she and she fe d our young minds 
with this absolute truth.  She pr
oved to be absolutely right.  
And she had this submission that 
coul d not  be  pla c ated by any kind of
 fo olish talk ab
out  what  Hitl er 
will turn out to be. 
 
 
Is this whe n you deci ded to 
s eek vi sas  to lea ve Hungar y?
 
 
No, my fathe r  ha d co
me t o Ameri ca on a busi ness
 trip i n 1936 i n c onnect

1936?
 
 
I think it was '36.
 
 
'39 I  know there was a Wo
rld's Fair in New York.
 
 
Yea h, but  he  must  ha ve  c o me  earli er  t o ma ke  a
rra nge me nts  for a  Hungaria n 
wi ne  pavili on.  He  wa s  
a wine  and l i quor whole s
ale merchant.  He came to
 America to ma
ke  ar range ments for a pa vilion 
and one of t he Hungarian mi nister s( I  under sta nd fr om my brother an
d he c an give you t he a cc urate  
name) made a co mment  aft e
r t hey issue d the nec essa
ry papers to hi m.  He
 was quote d as  sa ying, 
"It's a dirty shame that a G- d-da mn Je w should repr
esent us on the World's Fa

in t he highe s t pla ces  a nd l o
west  places an
d ever ywhere.
 
 
Your  father hear d t his?
 
 
We ll the quote was hand

re me mb ers t he na me  o f  th
e Hungari an offici al, s o me ver y hi gh of

came earl y before the World's Fair
 to make arrangements
 for  a Hunga rian pavili
on a nd he  ret urned 

wit hin te n da ys to Hungar y.  He c a me on a visit or 's visa a nd he retur ned.  In
 thos e da ys , a nyone who  
came to America would never drea

 visit o rs, whic he ve r way t hey 
came, t hey stayed her e.  That 's 
all they wanted wa s to
 es cape  t hos e  povert y-ri
dden la nds of Pola nd, 
and Hu ngary and all of them.  My
 fat her  was  the onl y one who r etu

 he returned 
wit hin t en da ys a nd he ca me  ba ck bec ause  it was  Pa

very trustworthy.  So he fi nall y went  bac k to ge

 mother saw this very early.
 
 
Wa s this after the ou
tbreak of t he war?
 
 
No, before the outbreak of the 
war.  Hitler was alre
ady too powerful and 
my mother was to o 
fri ght ene d.  He got the visa a nd he
 had the vi sa i n hi s bre ast poc ket .
  People were offering hi m all  
kind of monies to buy the visa 
off him and some how convert it to
 their own name s or picture or 
whatever it was.  My fat h
er of cours e wouldn't  give up the vi sa
 but  at  the  sa me  ti me  he r e fused t o  
come back t o Ameri ca becau

America i s not  the kind of

 was afraid that  if he brings 
his family here his ch
ildren would not be Jewish enough
.  They will abso
rb too much of 
Ameri canism rat her  t han 
Ju dais m.   He  wa s r e lu ct
ant to come back.  My mother  constantly ur ge d 
hi m - you must  sa ve  our  ch

agr ee d t o  come  to save  hi s  fa mil y. 
He  came back and arrived with pr
obably t he  las t boat  t hat  br ought 
him here.  The 
war had already 
broken out.  Courte sy of the great Fra nkli n Dela
no Roos evelt  who 
was such a great president.  He 
didn't  have  a  J e wish soul . He  di dn't
 wa nt  to  sav e  t he  Je ws.   He  wa

wer e not  upper most  in his mi nd 
and we  know now he refused to 
bomb t he  Auschwit
z r ails and he  
did too mu ch that wa s terri

ey ma na ged to post pone it long enou

begi nni ng of the  sta t e me n t I

Ye s, I re call .   So t wo ye ar s to get pape rs?
 
 

They dilly-dallied.  They would 
have had to give
 him the papers 
immediately.  Let's save on e 
Jewish famil y.  
There i s some l egiti macy he
re because t he father came 
here for t hat  pur pose and 
some of us wer e unde ra ge a nd co
uld have c o me under his a u spice s.  The y managed t o sa bot age  t his  
Je wish fa mil y a nd the y mana ged to 
sa bota ge all of the e ffort s t o  save 
Jews.  This is 
not my story but 
it is well document
ed in G- d knows how ma ny 
books.  So  Hungary declar
ed war against the United 
States and there was no Am
erican consulate because we
 were allies of Hitler.  
So were the Japanese.   
The  whol e t hing was  a b orted.  So 
then my  father eviden
tly spent another year
 and a half or  two 
years  - 41 until 44, I guess - 
to try to get papers to come to Is
rael since the Amer
ican plan didn't 
work.  So he  was  knoc ki ng 
on t he doors - get me  pape
rs to go to Palestine.
 
 
British-controlled Palestine.
 
 
Yeah.  And he was desperate.  Da
y and night he worked 
to get them papers 
to go to Palestine  
because America was out 
of the  questi on.  And he  fi nall
y suc cee ded again wit h  s o muc h  
post pone me nt from t he s e ge ntle s oul s who were not i n
terested in saving at le
ast one Je wis h fa mil y.  
By the time we got the 
papers, Hitler had occupied
 Hungary and I rememb er 
the papers had arrived  
and there they were - seve
n documents to get this fa mily to Is
rael  and Naziism was al ready i n full  
force in Hungary.  I alwa ys
 say I don't know what we
 use d  it  for, t oilet  paper or  what, but  it  wa s  
wo rthless.  An d instead of 
 
goi ng to America or  
to Palesti ne ......
 
 
How di d you final ly esc a pe?
 
 
I never mentioned to you that Phili
p, my br other ,  wa s t o
rn away from us imme diately in Auschwitz 
but his last plea to us - actually 
it was a ver y dra matic a nd ve ry unus
ual act of defiance on his part - 
that when men a nd women were se pa
rated and we ma de it to
 the life side and we were led into this 
huge wet monstr ous  pla ce where  t he y sha ve d us  and 
t hrew a rag at  us i n La
ger C - no it probabl y  
wa sn 't L a ge r  C - an d we  sa w t wo 
ot her monst ers  - this was Chi cha
 and I - and we s aw t w o ot he r 
shaved monsters in rags who we  
barely recognized
, but they looked fa mili
ar and t hese are our t wo 
sisters whom Mengele wa s original
ly leading to the cre matorium a
nd then he changed his mind and 
took them out to the life
 sid e.  As we were  sh av
ed a nd looki ng abs ol utel y hi de ous s o me  ki nd of a  
magic force appeared-- my br ot
her Phili p who by now was  we arin
g a  stripe d uni for m.  He  wa s 
shaved and evidently his group was re
ady t o be led to t he camp where 
they wer e goi ng t o l ead t he m 
- whet her  it  wa s A or  B or where ver
 they led the men.  
Evidently he kept look
ing for  his si ster s a nd 
he knew already t hat  his mother  
was no longer ali ve. 
 Ther e was somebody wh
o sha ve d  hi m a nd he  
wa s evidently a prisoner  in Auschwitz who wa s 
one  of the  peopl e  who s h
aved him and it wa s 
some body he kne w .  He  co
uld tell you more 
about this.  And he
 said to him that
 your  mot her  is  
already dead, or something about th
e smoke that  t here is your  mother
.  My br other  evidently pas sed  
down t he  word to t he  ot he
rs , to the next  gu
y and t he  next  guy.  Tell  
them to say kaddish.  We  no 

longer have pare nts .  He wa s evi de ntl y looki ng for 
whatever was left of hi
s fa mily hoping that the 
girls , bec aus e t hey are  young and 
heal thy, that  t hey are on the life 
side and he  ke pt  peeri ng through 
this window and this in
cr edibl y brave human being, despit e th
e Naz i s all around, ma na ge d to cl i mb  
through that window becaus
e  he s a w us and he fle w i nt o t he wi
ndow.  How he  di d t hat  I  don't t hink 
he knows.  And he  put his ar m ar
ound t hese  four  naked- hea de d mons
t ers, his siste r s.
  And he  shook 
us and he said, "Listen to 
me!   Eat!   Eat e ver ythi ng 
they give  you.  
I f they gi ve  you 
shit, eat shit, but 
you must  sur vive .  We must li ve. 
 We  must pay t h e m bac k a nd create
 a bett er world."  And he flew  
out .  He wa s  bac k throug
h the window and he was 
gone .  We  never sa w hi m 
agai n unti l  we  were i n  
Ameri ca.  But he managed t o - tal k
i n g about res i s t ance , what t his ma
n did, we ne ver ever for got  - I  
don't  know if he reme mb ers the wo
rds he  sai d  to us. I  
cl earl y remember t h em 
as these wo rds.  How 
the oth e rs r e me mb er  the m
, I don't know.  These ar
e the wor ds I reme mber  
and whenever it l ooke d  
like we were finished, there is no 
more life  left in us, somehow this
 vision came up 
of Philip sayin g  
you must  eat  no matter  what t hey 
give you because we mu
st  survive.  And then for three weeks he 
was evidently in Auschwitz
.  He  was  the  most  inge nious  pub
lic relations man 
or communication 
man probably in the 
world because he fo und pieces of wood 
in his camp becaus
e they were still  
buil ding the camp and t here wer e
 pieces of wood.  He
 somehow mana
ged to bart er his bread 
probably to a prisoner who had b
een there longer 
and probably had a little ch
unk of a pencil.  He 
carved every day on a pi ece of wood- you must live, you 
must li ve, you must 
sur vive.  And he 
wo uld say on that, my  sisters are 
in Lager C.  Their na
me  is Katz.  Whoever 
finds this piece of 
wood plea se  t oss  it  ove r  the  next  c a mp, Lager  t hey
 called it, until it reac
hes  La ger  C.  And t he se 
band of res i s t ers, t hese  pr isoners , ma nage d t o  thr o
w it over  the  wire , La ger  to La ger , unt il it  rea che d 
Lager C.  An d we  got the me ssage ev
e r y si ngle da y for  about t hr ee we eks .
 
 
Who wo uld catch it?
 
 
So me body wo uld find it in th
e sa me spot t he sa me way and 
we would go t here  looki ng for it  
beca use  by now we  wer e tr aine d.
  I t  was  a  sec r et l angua ge  of
 the mo st power
ful  under groun d 
communication in the world and we
 found the piece of wo
od or s o me body br ou
ght  it t o us bec ause  
by this time they knew 
us s o t here  wer e s o me people who kne
w us .  They br ought  us t his  li fe  
me ssa ge a nd the n one da y it st oppe d and the n we  we
r e c ertai n that he is up i n s moke  or M engele  
took him to another camp.  We 
ne ver hea r d fr om hi m aga i n until  we  arrive d i n  Ameri c a .  An  
Ameri can soldier  found hi
m in a hospital and 
wrot e to my fat h er becaus
e  t he onl y t hing -  we didn't  
have a ny bel ongings -  the  onl y t hing 
we were all schooled i n at home,
 by my mother , I  guess , or by  
each other, t hat  i f we ever li ve
d thr o ugh this war , we
 should reme mb
er  one t hing -  my father 's 
addr ess , l66 Ross  Street , Brooklyn
, where my  aunt lived, 
and my father lived w
ith his sist er.  An d 
that 's what  we reme
mb ered, this address.  Th
at wa s the only document we
 had, that wa
s the only 
paper, which was not a pape
r .  It  was  in our  hea d, engr ave d, 166 
Ross  Stree t .  He  gave  t his  addre s s  
to the American sold
i er  who li berat e d hi m.  He  found hi m in 
a hospital with a bulle
t in his leg.  He 
wa s i n si x c onc entra tion ca mps whil e 
we were in two.  He tried to es
ca pe ,  a ft er he  trie d t o ma ke  a  
deal  with t he Nazi  who he caught  
cha ngi ng hi s clothes , I  belie ve, be
cause he wanted t o escape when 
the A mericans were so near
 that they were overhead 
and they were in the ca
ttle cars shi
pping them 

further into Nazidom.  But 
this is something he woul
d have to t ell you.  Bu
t in any event he shot  
hi m in t he  le g .  He  didn't  wa nt  to 
kill  hi m, it  l ooks  like, but  he  s hot
 hi m in the leg and this American 
soldi er  found hi m i n  the 
hospita l.  We  di dn't  know a nyt hing 
about  hi m, this  whol e  s aga  of si x 
concentration camps and the bulle
t until he arrived in 
January 1945.  I will 
return to how we 
survi ve d.  Whe n Aus c hwi t z wa s be
ginning t o be li qui date d in t he 
fall of 1944, we
 spent all our 
ener gies -  whatever  was left i n 
our 40 t o 50 pound hu
man bei ng that we each
 weighe d, 40, 50, 60 
pounds, and I had t yphus  t hroughout
 t he  ni ne  months  that  I  wa s i n  
the camps, whatever  ener gy we 
had we spent it  on onl y one thi ng 
-  t o  run away fr om Me
ngele's selecti ons, because i f Mengel e  will 
select  the four of us, one  woul d 
go to another camp, one would go
 t o t he  cre ma t ori u m, one  woul d 
go yet  to a n other  ca mp, one  woul d 
stay here.  We cannot  aff ord a se
lection if we s
till want to be 
four si sters.  We  were a rather
 lar ge  fa mi ly.  The r e wa s a not her 
fa mil y who ha d six sist ers.  We  
wer e pr obably the ne xt large st 
be ca use t he y we re de ci mate d.  Fa mil i es  wer e tot all y de ci mate d. 
Because we wer e cl ose i n age, young 
and he althy, he pic ked us  out .  So
 the  four of us 
made it all the  
wa y through six mo nths of Ausc
hwitz in the worst ti
me s of Ausc hwitz a nd esca pe d Mengele 's  
selection even if we had to
 run, as we did on
e ni ght, a nd he shot a fter us
, but he didn't ge t us in t he  
dark.  So we remained alive.  We
 tried anythi ng a n d e ver ythi ng to 
remain together.  
We made it sort  
of t o t he entr ance to the crematori u m
 
where they were going to 
take us out of Lager C in
 Nove mber on a bitter co
ld night andput us in  
the cr e mat or ium a nd the n as  it happene d s o ma ny 
times we were unable to
 fi gur e out what t hey 
wer e going t o do a nd t he y change d 
the or ders onc e more .  I nst ead of
 putting us in the crematorium,  
they put us  on trai ns , on 
i ce-col d trains, wit h heat ed cars for  th
e Nazis and ours were
 ice- cold.  The y  
took us t o a n other  conc entration 
camp  called Bir nbaumel , or that 's 
t he w a y I  re me mb er th e na me , in  
Eastern Germany.  We  trav
eled, I don't know how long
, fr ozen to death and st
arved.  We  
arrived in 
a pla ce c alle d Birnba umel wher e the y ha d a  thousand
 pri soners in a forest  
in umbrella-like paper-
thin wo od structures with no floor. 
 It  wa s onl y  ice .   T he  walls  wer e  
i ce and the floor was ice.  It  was 
eastern Ge rmany in a forest.
 
 
What  were  you weari ng?
 
 
Ra gs.  Chicha was wearing a wood
e n s hoe and one r egular  s hoe .  
The  only t hing t he y  let  us  kee p  
were eyeglasses and shoes and the shoe s wore
 out and some how all 
kinds of wooden clogs  
appeare d.  M y si ster  ha d one  wo
ode n shoe a nd one  regular  s hoe .  
 
 
Co ats, blankets?
 
 
Ra gs  and whate ver  we c oul d some
how manage  t o  - ma ybe  the y gave
 us something or we  bartered 
something.  We  had a lit
tle more  c lot hing tha n  we had i n  
Auschwitz but certain
ly not enough to 
keep you wa rm in the fore
st.  Ev ery mo rning we  had 
to go to the other end of
 the forest  t hrough the  
town where all the Germans 
s aw us .  The y  sai d  they ne ver  s a w us
.  The y  were going t o  work a nd to  

school .  Twi ce a day t he y sa w us c o mi ng a nd going.
  The y had to stop tr affic for a t housa nd of 
wret ched skeletons t o walk t hrough 
t he t o wn t o r each the ot her end of
 t he forest t o do Schatzar beit  
[
Schutz ar bei t
] di ggi ng di tches  for t he  tank t r aps.  In t he  
frozen eart h, i f we wanted t o st art digging,  
we ha d to he at up the  ear th firs
t  because t he earth was 
fr oze n.  The Ger ma ns st ood t her e wit h t hei r  
incredibl e coats and uni for ms and r i
fles and they would warm their 
fat  r u mps at  the fir e and they  
would chase us away wi th the butt of their rifl es
 because heat  t he eart h, 
not the Jews , you know. 
Thi s  went  on all  wi nter  fr om No
vemb er to January and 
we  got  t hinner  a nd fr a
iler and sicker and my  
typhus  was r aging.  How I didn't  di
e , I  never know.  I ha d t yphus fo
r nine mont hs.  The doct or s ai d  
under  the best of care at  
home  I  woul d have die d i n days.  Fi
nally after digging 
the bloody German 
earth and watching how the N
azi s wer e so gentl e  with thei r  mur der
ous  dogs  and what  the y di d to us.  
Finally the end came
.  We  were in Birnbaumel in these 
ic y hut s a nd on a  Sunday aft ernoon on  
January 21, they gathered us in a 
tremendous hurry.  The 
wo rd  was  al wa ys los,  
los, sc hnell, sc hnel l , 
fast, fast, whatever  t he hell 
it meant.  We  had to line
 up in funferreih
 al wa ys fi ve  in
 a row.  They 
counte d us  a nd wit hin minute s they mar che d us out
 of the camp.  
Ha d we hidde n the n, which we  
didn't know, had we  hidden anywhe
re, they had no time to come lo
oking for  us  a nd the peopl e who 
were in the so called hospital wh
ic h wa s cal led t he Re vier  with t heir l egs  froz en off a nd t he y had  
gangre ne a n d they couldn't t ake  th
e m out  and t hey di dn't want t o
 shoot them beca
us e the y didn't  
want  to leave t he evidence behind -  
dead bodi es .  Those  peopl e wer e
 the ones who su
r vive d  be cause 
if we  had hi dde n anywhere we woul d ha ve  be en lib
erat ed that  very aft er
noon because th
e Russians 
wer e t hat  cl ose but  we  di dn't know 
anythi ng a bout  that.  We
 only kne w t hat  we  ha
d to go very fa st - 
run, line up, and march ou
t of the camp.  We were 
out on the road on Sunday 
afternoon, bitter, bitter 
cold, snow and ice al
l over and we  had to march fa st and fast
 and faster.  We  we
re led out of the 
ca mp  a nd  we wer e  marc hin g t o war ds  th e  west  wh er
e Hitler was ostensibly ru
ling.  We  didn't  know  
where we were going.  We  marched 
until the evening.  In 
the evening they had put
 us up in another 
evac uate d c a mp wher e a thousa nd gir l s ha d been take
n out of.  We s pent  t he ni ght  the r e and that 
was Sunday night 
and Monday we marc
hed another day in 
these hideous conditio
ns.  Rachel was 
coughing.  It sounde
d like she had TB.  It was 
terrible.  But the fo ur of
 us were still together. 
Tuesday mo rning we  trie
d to fi ght back again. 
 On e  ni ght  we  wer e  h
oused i n  an evacuated 
concentr ation camp an
d the sec ond night  the y put  us  up i n 
s e veral  bar ns .  The c o ws  wer e i n one  
barn and the straw and their beddin
g, I guess ,
 was in a not her  ba rn 
and we ga thered 
enough strength, 
inner  and physical  stre ngth, t o tr y to
 ma ke it once  more a n
d we hid ourselves in 
the straw,  on the top 
level .  We t hought i f the y c o me wit h  their  pit chf
orks  to dri ve  us  out of our hidi ng pla ce well  the n  
that's the way we'll die bu
t l et 's try it  anyhow.  We successfull y
 hid our selves.  Seve ral  other  pe ople  
had done t he  sa me t hing.  They had 
no time to pitchfork us
 out of the hiding place
s.  They knew that 
some  of us  must  ha ve  b
een hi ding i n t hes e stra w re fuge s.  Cunni
ngly, a s al ways , the y began t o boil  
potat oes .   It 's not  that  t he y wa nte d t o fe ed us but
 t he smell  would lur e us 
out fr om the  hidi ng pl ace  
and that 's  exactly what  it did.  The 
four of us wh o struggle
d so hard to re
mai n four  toget h er gave  up 
our  hi ding pl ace  be cause  the  s mell  of potat o was  ir re
sisti ble.  To eat  once 
more was more i mport ant  
than per haps fr eedom and we volu
ntarily gave up our hidi ng pl ace a
nd li ned up for the potat oes, t he 
four of us together with the others.  By the time we re
ached the kettle in whic
h they were boiling the 
potat oes , the re were  none .  Th
ey were all gone.  But by no
w we wer e pris one rs a gai n.  
 
 

How di d you get  a wa y now?
 
 
Thi s wa s Tuesda y mor ni ng.  Sunda y we sle pt i n  
the camp and Monday we 
sl ept  in t he bar n and 
Tue sday mo rning on the  23r d, we wer e pri soners  a gain,
 and we  lined up
 and we marche
d again.  By 
this time  a great many girl
s had died and anyone w
ho c oul dn't  mar ch wa s  shot
 r ight  there.  It  was 
Tuesday mo rning, I don't kn
o w  wh at  h our  it  was ,  
late morning probably, th
ey wer e marchi ng us.  
We  were in this town called Jaga
dschutz and there were three sister
s in the back of
 us who escaped 
so t he  guar ds who were  in t he  ba ck guar ding us  in
 this marching line an
d the guards on the two 
sides  went  al l bac k t o s hoot t wo girl s, as we l ate
r found out , a n d the thir d on
e had to dig a gr ave  for  
the two sist ers.  Only t he guar
d in the front remained
.  M y s i ster  Chi cha , who was t he  he roi ne  
always, was at the end of the line
 as we entered this 
little village called Jagads
chutz.  There was a 
little house of a blacksmith and she 
had enough presence to
 figure out that if 
no smoke is coming 
out of the chimney - they didn't ha
ve any sophisti cated fi
re , heating arr ange me nts -  i f no s moke i s  
coming out  then they mu
st be  gone .  They mu
s t  ha ve  es ca ped fro m t h e onc o ming libe rator s, 
whoe ver t he y were  - Americans or Russia ns  or w
ho knows what; we  di dn't 
know a nyt hing about t he  
status of the war.  Bu
t t hey have escaped evi d
ently and she bolted and 
ran out .  She had made  
anot her  at te mpt  to e sca pe but  by t h
is ti me we agreed t hat  ost ensi b
ly we 'r e not  goi ng to be  a i di ng 
each ot her i n  the same way as we 
always did.  There was no questio
n t hat we were al ways goi ng t o  
do the same thing.  This 
t i me  we  sai d some body has 
t o sur vive .  Whoe ver  c an,
 let's make it.  So she  
bolted and she ran into
 the little house and she ran up
 to the stairs.  Nobody wa
s in there.  It was ice 
cold.  She went up to the attic.  
Rachel was marching right next to
 her and she ran.  Nobody looked  
bac k.  Nobody said anyt hin
g.  I sa w Rac hel and I  ran a nd I wa s certa
in t hat  Ci pi st anding ne xt t o me  
would do exactly the same thing. Rachel and I ran into a little dogh
ouse.  The dog wa
s gone.  The y  
took the dog away.  We hid in th
e doghous e cr ouche d.  Su
ddenly in this dead
ly silence and sno w  
and it was a snowstorm but it was be
autiful, white, it was Christma s 
time like Christ
ma s ti me , peac e  
on earth, good will towa rd
s me n.  We  were crouchin
g in the  doghouse  and t h
en we hear d these st eps  
in the silence, this abso
lute silence and snow.  It
 was the oberschutzfuhrer, 
the Nazi with his dog. 
He was wal k ing on t he r o ad c ursi ng t h e Je ws mu
mbling thi ngs at who esc aped behi nd holding hi m 
back fr om marchi ng  ahead away fr om the liberat
or s and t aki ng his preci ous 
cargo al ong.  Whethe r  
the wi nd ble w our  sc ent  awa y, I d
on't know, but the dog ev
ide ntly di d not s mell us and he pa sse d us 
by.  Evidently Chicha wa
s watching this fr om the 
window in the attic and 
she yelled out all our  
names and said Ci pi, Rachel , I sabel
l a ar
e you a l l  her e.  And we  sai d
 ye s, well  we 'r e here , Ra chel  
and Isa bella but Ci pi is pr oba bly in t he  next  hous e 
beca use  she had t o do exactly
 what we did.  Once  
the obershutzfuhrer wa
s gone my sister yelle
d down, "Come on
 up here to the attic
.  Here I 
am and I 
found a fr oz en c abbage a nd i t 's  delici ous .  We  ran 
up a nd a fe w mi nu
tes later the door
 wa s sli ght ly  
ope ne d and t here  wer e  three  ot her  wr etche d  cre at ure
s who escaped and they ma
de their wa y into the 
sa me house .   But it was n 't  Ci pi. 
 This was the 23rd of
 January.  We stayed 
in this house and had 
another anti-semitic experi
ence when a forced labor
 worker from Poland, th
ey were work
ing around 
in Germany, they were fo
rce d la bore rs.  He  ca me  and he want ed
 t o cha se us out  beca use he wa nte d  
to take the contents of the house.
  He threatened us 
t hat  the Ger mans ar e a
ll around and they are 
going to kill us and we
'd better leave.  I th
ink Chicha told him 
if this is what yo
u want in the house  
you can t ake  e verythi ng but  
let  us  st a y her e and e at some  be fore we
 die.  Leave us al
one.  He finally 

left.  We stayed t here Tuesday a
nd Wednesday.  We dnesday night the 
lights were cut.
  Chicha was  
smart enough to say 
the Germans must ha ve left.  They cut th
e electricity.  Sure enough it was true. 
It was Thursday morning.  We 
were in our wa rm bedding, bare
fo oted and sudd
e n l y  we  sa w a  
tremendous army ente
ring the village, bloo
d splattered soldiers, fighti
ng soldiers, spen
t completely,  
and all kinds of war ma chinery, a
nd we  didn't know who they were
.  They didn't  l o ok li ke  th e  
Hungaria n s oldier s  we kne w a nd t hey didn't  l ook 
like the German soldie
rs.  Wh o were t hey? 
Sudde nl y we  s aw t he  s i ckle and the  
hammer and the red flag.  We  kn
ew that wa s Russian.   We  ran 
out bare foot ed i n the s now a nd we 
st arted to scream.  We are liber ated
, li berate d.  It  wa s a n insa ne 
sound.  You pr oba bly he ard i t on 42
nd st reet .  Then we st arted t o 
cry like nobody ever cried.  We  
are li berat ed, we are li ber ated.  But  wh
ere are they all?  
They ar e all  dead.
 
 
And Ci pi?
 
 
An d  th ere  was no  Ci pi.   No w t hat  we  were  li bera t e
d we  went  l ooking for  Cipi.  We  s pe nt six we eks  
there on the road waiting for all the survivor s wh
o survived pass through 
our  t o wn going t o wards 
the tra i n a nd all we l ooked for was  fi ndi ng Ci pi.  We
 ne ver  found he r.  All  
those basta r ds who s ay 
toda y for get  it, it ha ppe ned long a g
o, I have only this to tell th
e m.  To me  it ha ppe ned yester da y 
beca use  it  took me t hirt y  some  y
ear s be for e some body relat ed the  st or
y to me  of wh at happened to 
Cipi.  I looked for her for 
all those years.  If I saw 
a fa miliar walk I followed
 that for bl ocks . I we nt 
to buy s o me brea d i n a  ba kery a nd 
I  thought ma ybe  this  ol d la dy is 
my si ster  who disa ppe ared thirt y  
some year s a go.  And 
even today when I know that
 absolutely certain
 that she's de ad, if I see a he ad 
that  looks familiar, I run.  I ne ver 
had any peace from that
 but I know fr om this
 eye- wit n ess, one of 
the girls  who wa s wit h us, her na me was  Eva  [Phili
p] [ph][385] who told me
 that 30 some years 
later when I told he
r now you can tell me . 
 I me t her a couple of years be
fore and she st
arted to tell 
me what  happened and I br
oke down crying so ter rib
ly that she stopped the st
ory right there.  But I  
told her now I am sitting 
in my kitchen and I'm very
 comfortable.  You won'
t see me cry.  You're  
talking on the teleph
one.  Pl ease tell  me what 
happened.  And then
 she told me th
at Cipi followe d 
me  so me  mi nute s  later  a nd  th ey  c a
ught  her  and they beat  he r s o  br
utall y  that  she  thi nks  she  we nt  
crazy.  She wanted to di
e.  Thr ee more weeks they mar ched 
in the most wret ch
ed conditions and 
they refused to kill her. 
 She begged them kill me
, kill me.  They knew that
 her sisters were gone. 
She said she doesn't wa
nt to live, please 
kill me.  They refused to kill 
her because they knew that she 
suffer s mor e  ali ve because her  si
sters are gone.  She lo
st them to freedom. 
 Ov er and over she 
begged them to kill he
r and they refused to
 kill her.  There we
re no more barbed 
wires so she had no  
way to kill herself. Another indi
cation that you could not die when
 you wanted to. 
 You could only  
die whe n t h ey wante d you to die  a n d onl y die  t h
eir way, not your wa y.  The y dra gge d her  to 
Bergen-Belsen for 
three weeks in th
at condition.  Somebo
dy saw her ther
e.  All she 
could say was 
my siste rs, t hank G-d they'r e in Am
e r ica pr oba bl y.  The y 'r e  free.  At  
least they live, at least they're  
free.  She was lovingly ta
lking about us to th
is person who later on was 
libe rated, ca me  to America, 
and she c oul dn't c ope  wit h
 me mo ries of Au schwitz and hanged hers
el f.  But she l e ft us wit h Ci pi 's  
wo rds.  Then she wa s liberated.   
M y sister  Ci pi  was  li berat e d.  
And then she died
.  And in those 
hea ps of Be rgen- B else n, those  m
ounds , t hose mile s of bodies  tha t
 t he y wer e c hur ning up wit h  

machi ner y, one of them wa

You wr ote  a  poe m a bout your yo

Ye s I  di d.
 
 
Woul d you please  rea d it  for us?
 
 
By  the way I want you to 
know t hat we were t he very first  survi
vors  of Aus chwitz  to rea ch t his  la nd .  
We  were put aboard a me

Finally we made 
our  way to Odess a by Apr
il, from January to April. We  were 
put  aboa rd t his shi p and we wer e 
through hal f the  worl d for nearl y
 fi ve weeks and arrived by some
 myst er ious  c oinci dence  on t he 
very da y t h e war e nde d.  We arri ved on Ma y 8, 
1945.  That ma de  us 
t he first  survivors of 
Au sc hwitz.   Yo u wa nt  t o hear  t he  p oe m that  I  wr
ote  about  my si ster:   Ri
ng around 
a rosy, six 
million is only a 
numb er, but each 
somebody's mother, 
somebody's child, so mebody's lover,  
some body's  bride .   Potyo 
wa s just t hirtee n;  she wa s my sist er. 
 She had the wi sdom
 of a child of 
war.  She was full of fear yet ti
pt oed with te ndernes s, l aughte r a nd 
love in a wo rld of ma dmen.  She  
wa s a weeping willow, a song of so
r r ow, a poe m  of infi nite bea uty
.  Why does Hitl e r  hate me ?  
Why does he love hate?  Mama , I am
 only thirteen.  I have songs ye
t to learn, game s yet to play. 
Give me time to live.  Gi
ve me  ti me  to d i e.   M a ma , ho w  ca n  I 
do all the living in 
just  an inch of 
ti me?  On a wretched piece of 
earth, alien land of terror and 
chaos, on anothe
r planet called 
Ausc hwitz, Mengele poi nts at Potyo - 
Ri ng around a rosies, pocket full
 of pos ies , as he s, a she s.  - -  
That  it  was .
 
 
Thank you, Isab
