Question:  This is the United States Holo
caust Memorial Museum interview with Eva 
Yachnes conducted by Ag
nishka Nakur (ph) on October 17,
 2010, at the Kindertransport 
Association Conference in Arlington, Virg
inia. We would like to ask you a question 
about your childhood.  How 
far do your memo ries reach and wh at do you rememb er 
about your hometown?  
 

Answer:  My earliest me
mory is from somethingj
ust a scene that took place before I was 
two years old, so I don't know 
how oldwhere I'm standing in my  crib and I see my father 
coming into  the room, and my  mo ther is already 
in bed. After that, th
ere'sthere are not too 
many things, a scene here, a scene there.  
Definitely, I remember fro m three on quite a 
few scenes.  There's no continuous memory.
 
Q: I didn't ask you that at the beginning but 
could you tell us what year you were born in?
 
A: I was born May 1932, in Vienna.
 
Q: In Vienna.  And you just mentioned that 
you recall the very early memo ries of your 
mother and your father.  What were their names?
 
A: My  mo th er 's n ame  was L eon
ee (ph), her maiden name was 
Oberzone (ph).  Her father 
was Croatian and her mo ther was Czech.  And 
my  father's  name was Ernst Steiner (ph) 
and his parentshis mo ther was originally Czec
h and his father Polish.  So th ey were all 
from different parts of the AustroHungarian 
Empire, and they landedmy  grandparents all 
landed up in Vienna. 
 
 
Q: So I guess your maiden name 
was probably Ob ersteiner, right?
 
A: Obersteiner (ph), right. Steiner in German.
 
Q: Steiner in German. 
 
A: Uhu.
 
Q: Did you have any siblings?
 
A: No, I was only child.  And when I was abou
t two years oldwhen I was born, my  father 
lost his job.  His boss saidthis was during 
th e Great Depression, and his boss said, "I 
know you cannot support a family on what I 
pay you so you're fi
red."  And he never 
found another job in  Vienna. And he ende
d uphe was a communist and he ended up 
finding work in the Soviet 
Union.  And when he came 
back he had to live illegally 
because the communist party was illegal. So that
 was probably the only
 memory I have of 
my father, when I wasbefore I left Viennano
, II do remember him again.  After he came 
back, he tried to teach me
 a few w o rds of English.
 
Q: When he returned from Russia,
 right?  From working in Russia?
 
A: Yes.  And he was jailedhe was caught; 
he was jailed with Nazis and co mmunists.  
Both parties were illeg al; they were jailed toge
ther as political priso n ers.  And when he 
got outthis was already near the time of the 
Anschluss; it was in 1938.  And my  mo ther 
immediately was able to get a domestic's visa 
to go to England as a cook, so she left first.
 

Q: And you stayed w
ith your father or 
 
A: I stayed with my  grandmot
her.  My mo ther and I had been living with her mo ther, my  
maternal grandmother, so mo st of my  memo ries are from my  maternal grandmother's 
apartment.  And while my father
 was away he sent back as mu ch money as he could, but 
my  mo ther and I lived with my  grandmother, 
and I stayed with her. The second one to 
leave was my father, who left 
illegally with friends
 over the border into Switzerland, and 
then to France, and ev
entually he was intern
ed in France, and my rich great uncle from 
America sent money to take him to New York
.  And also, my grandparents, my father's 

parentsit was my  grandfather's brother who was 
here in New York City
, and so they were 
also rescued.  My great uncle brought them 
over, and ev entu ally also my  father's next 
younger brother, and my  mo ther and I jo
ined the family in
 New York in 1940.
 
Q: And you mentioned that your father was 
working in  Ru ssia.  What was his job there 
and what was his profession in Vienna?
 
A: He was what we now call a 
high school dropout, but he we
nt to  technical school and 
he became sort ofhis jobI'm  not always sure 
what he exactly studied but he workedbefore 
he lost his job on my accoun
t, he worked for 
a company that set up medical equipment 
for doctors, you know, in doct
ors' officesfluoroscopes and wh
atever.  They had very little 
equipment then but whathe to
ok it to the office and he set it up and made sure it was 
work ing and so on.
 
Q: Would you say that you were re
latively welloff until he lost his job?
 
A: No.
 
Q: No?
 
A: No.  He didn't  get paid 
very mu ch, and my wh en aw hen my  mo ther and I lived with 
my  maternal grandmother, she had lost everyt
hing during the course of World War I.  
 
Q: I see.
 
A: So there were the remnant
sshe had been wealthy.  There 
were the remnants of that.  
She always used to show me
 the wonderful chinaware and 
silver and so  on and say, 
"When you grow up and get ma
rried, this will be yours." 
On my father's side, my 
grandfather had a small butcher shop, a little 
neighborhood butcher sh
op, so they were 
definitely lowermiddle class.  M y on my mother
's side, they were very uppermiddle class, 
but I never saw anything of that be
cause we lived in relative poverty.
 
Q: Did you attend any 
schools in Vienna?
 
A: Only  kinderg arten.
 
Q: Did you have many friends?
 

A: Well, I had a best friend who lived across th
e street.  Her name was Bitte (ph), and she 
was half Je wish, and I never found out what 
happened to her.  And I had myotherwise, I 
can only remember playing with
 the children in kindergarten
, and when we went to the 
park, always whatever childrenwere together, played to gethe
r.  So I would bring a ball to 
play with, or a jumping rope or whatever, an
d we all played together.  But the only real 
friend that I remember is Bitte, who lived across the street from me.
 
Q: And those children out in th e playground 
and in th e kinderg arten, did you live in a 
strictly Jew ish district or was it a mixed district?
 
A: It was not a Jewish district.  It was th
e FourthFourth District
 in Vienna, and wemy 
grandmother was told she had to  leave butbecause it was not Jewish.  But the 
kindergarten  was run by a Jewish organization.
 
Q: I see.  So if you were to describe y
our family would you say that your family was 
relatively wellassimilated?  
 
A: Yes.
 
Q: Or did you sp eak all German between each other?
 
A: Yes, all German.  My grandf
ather on my  mo ther's side had 
been  one of the founders of 
the Free Thinkers Association of Vienna, so 
we were not religious.  And on the other 
side, my  father's father had had a Jewishhe 
came from sh tetl in Poland, had had a Jewish 
education, and sort of shook th e dust off his 
feet, that was it, no more.  And so I grew up 
with Ch ristmas trees; I did notw e were not religious.
 
Q: You didn't practice any 
Jewish customs or religion?
 
A: Not at all, no, no. 
 
Q: Didn't  know any Jewish pray ers. 
 
A: No.  We learned a little Hebrew song in
 kindergarten, but I, no, had no religious 
education in Austria.
 
Q: And do you recall when  the 
things started to change?  
Do you remember when the 
tension started growing in Vienna?
 
A: What I noticed firstwell, first of all, I 
didn't start school when  
I should have, when I 
turned six.  I remember my grandmother rented
 out a room to a boarder.  It was the same 
room I remember in that scene where my fa
ther is comin g  into the room. Well, she 
eventually  had to rent out that room, and 
the lady mu st have been a Nazi because she 
gave me a coin for my sixth birthday, and sh
e said, "Soon we'll have a new picture on the 
coins."  And she was very triumphant; you kno
w, she was gloating over this. And then I 
reme mb er the mo st frighten ing thing, wh
en  the doorbell rang one day.  And my  

grandmother was a little hard of hearing, she 
didn't  hear, and I kept telling her, "Oma, the 
door."  And she went to the door and these 
two men in Nazi unifo rm
 came in with the 
high, shiny black boots and th
e whole thing.  And they  passed through th e room where I 
was, and one of them patted me on the head
 and said something.  And I have no id ea 
what he said, I justI was terrified.  And 
they went into the 
next room with my 
grandmother and shut the door.  And I heard a 
lot of talking and then they all came out, 
and my  grandmother came back from closing 
the front door and she had tears running 
down her face.  And she said, "We have to
 move out, we're not 
allowed to live here 
anymore." And then  one dayI don't know how 
many days after thiswe went to a police 
station, my  grandmother and I, and I believe 
she got a stay, you know, she didn't have to 
move immediately, because we stayed there.  But I remember the police statio n, the big 
picture of Hitler and the flags and so on, wh
ich I found very frighte
ning, but she seemed 
relieved, and I'm sure it's becau
se she got this stay, she didn't have to leave immediately.
 
Q: Was your mo ther already in England?
 
A: Yes.  My  mo th ermy  mo th er too k  me to  
a friend's house outside Vienna, because my  

parents thought in the first days
 I would be safer staying with
 friends of theirs who were 
outside the city.  And they al
so had children.  So I stay
ed there a few days, and my 
mother, when she put me to bed that first ni
ght and sh e said to be very good and brav e 
and she would see me as soon as 
possible, that she was leaving.
 
Q: And you're talking about m
oving to England right now?  
In the house outside the city, 
it was in Vienna?
 
A: It was outside Vienna.  And then after a fe
w days my  father said I could co me back to 
Vienna, and my  gran dmother came and got me and took me back to Vienna.
 
Q: Was there anything specific happe
ning in Vienna at that time that
 
A: I don't know.  I think they we
re just unsure.  This wasmy moth
er left in April of '38, so 
in March '3 8 is when the Germans actually ca
me in in person, and then she left almost 
immediately, in April. My 
mo ther was very blond and bl
ueeyed and she looked, if 
anything, Slovak, not Jewish, if you're going by stereotype.  
 
Q: Right.
 
A: So my  father pushed her on the Aryan line when it was time to get her papers 
stamped.  And he said, "These are still Aust
rians, they'l l look at you and they  won't ask 
for proof."  And sure enough, th
at's what happened , they just stamped, instead of standing 
in the long, long Jewish line. 
So sh e left and thenshe left me
 with these friends, and then 
it couldn't  have been lo ngtwo, three daysmy  
father brought me back
.  I think they were 
just unsure of wh at woul
d happen in the city.
 

Q: So th at probably  happened shortly after the An schluss, right?
 
A: Beforeactually before the 
An schluss.  It was in betw een the marchin (ph) because 
when  she left, the man who stamped her papers
 told my mother, "Be 
sure to go to the 
embassy and vote about the Anschluss."  He 
was thinking, Go od Aryan, she'll vote yes. 
 
Q: For the Anschluss, yes?
 
A: So it was part of, you know, this interim pe
riod.  And then I have a memo ry that mu st 

have been around Kristallnacht, becaus
e I remember comingwalking with my 
grandmother, and we passed wher
e my  kindergarten was.  And as I said, it was run by a 
Jewish organization, and I saw a truck 
pulling away with th
e furniture from the 
kindergarten  and broken things 
on the ground and broken glass.
  So I think that probably 
was around that time maybe, Kris
tallnacht. And then the next th
ing, my father took me to 
the parkI think it was right befo re he was go
ing to  leaveand at firs
t he had thoughthe 
would take me along but then
 
Q: To Russia, right?
 
A: No, to France, to Switzerland and France. 
 And then I think he
 got a little bit more 
realistic, th at a sixyearold trying to clim
b illegally over the Al
ps into Switzerland 
wouldn't w o rk too well.  So th
at was when he tried to teach  me a few words of English, 
thinking my mother is 
more likely to be able 
to get me to join her.
 
My parents realized immediately that there wa
s not a hope if they didn't each go out as 
quick ly as possible and then try and bring me 
out.  So my mother, in England, was trying 
to get papers for me to join her.
 
Q: She got you on th
e Kindertransport?
 
A: That was before theas soon as she left sh
e started trying.  And there was a school, a 
board ing school that even signed a paper th
at she had paid for my  schooling but the 
people, the officials, didn't believe it beca
use how could a domestic
 get up enough money 
to pay fo r a year of boarding school?  
 
Q: I see.
 
A: So th ey didn't  believe it.
 
But it was my  grandmother who found out about
 the Kindertransport.  I have no idea 
how, but she did.
 
Q: Did she talk to you about it?
 
A: No.  All I remember is sh
e toldshe showed me:  "I have
 sewn your mother 's  a ddress 
into your coat.  If anything ha
ppens, you know that"she told
 me, "You're going to meet 

your mo ther, your mo ther is going to be there 
to meet you, and here's  her address in your 
coat.  If anything"you know, "if you get lost or anything, this
 is where your mo ther is."  
 
And she packedI don't reme mb er her packin g th
e suitcase.  All I know is I have to leave 
my  doll behind; she didn't pack my doll.
 
Q: I'm sure that was really upsetting.
 
A: It was.  I was only six a
nd the doll would have been a co
mfort.  But I had a bag with 
my lunch, the food for the trip, and we left 
at night.  And although I was usually an 
obedient child, I clung to her and screamed on t
op of my  lu ngs wh en they tried to take me 
away.  The families were not 
allowed to go on the platform
s so we were in this big 
waiting room, it was nighttime, and they trie
d tothe women who were organizing the 
transport tried to leave me with the other ch
ildren, and I ju st held onto  my  gran dmother 
and screamed.
 
Q: So you didn't  wa
nt to go, did you?
 
A: My grandmother was the la
styou know, this was my  bas
tion, my home, and everybody 
went away  and now she's sendi
ng me goodness knows wh ere.  I think I didn't really 
believe that my  mo therI don't know. And so
 
Q: Did you doI mean, your mother left to E
nglandit was still very early, you were very 
young.  I mean, did youdid you rememb er your
 mo ther very well when you were going 
on the trip?
 
A: Oh, sure.  It was only a few 
months different.  I left in D
ecemb er of '38; she left in 
April of '38.
 
Q: Were you closer with your grandma or with your mo ther?
 
A: My moth er went out to wo
rk  so my  gran dmother watched me all day, you know, I was 
with her all day.  But emotionally, it was my
 mother.  I mean, alwa
ys it was my mother.
 
Q: So did th ey succeed even tually in
 separating you fro
m your grandmother?
 
A: Oh, yeah.  Physically, I m
ean.  They took my fingers off 
her skirt, and as soon, you 
know, as I was out of sight of my grandmother I 
think I just resigned myself:  This is it.  I 
stood with th e other ch ildren waiting to  get on the train.
 
[Interview interrupted when
 person enters room.]
 
Q: So we were just talk ing 
about you waiting with other child
ren on the platform.  Were 
there many children?
 
A: I don'tI don't know.  I mean, there were 
quite a few but I have no idea exactly how 
many were on th at particular transport.
 

Q: Were they upset or that
 mostly was just regular? 
 
A: I can't reallyI think I was too selfabsorb
ed  toyou know, I justI don't even reme mb er 
really looking around me at all.  The next
 thing I rememb er, I was in a comp artment on 
the train.  There were four of us in the comp
artment, and I think we 
were all rather among 
the smaller ones there, all four of us.  An
d it was nighttime, so one of the women who 
escorted us put some blankets on th
e flooryou know how those compartments
 
Q: Between the seats, right?
 
A: Between the seats.  So tw
o of us she put down  to go to
 sleep on the floor and tw o on 
the seats, and so mewhere in the middle of 
the night somebody came again and ch anged 
us around, so those on the floorI started out 
on the floor, then I was on a seat.  I don't 
remember sleeping very much th
at night.  It was just, you know, it was too confusing and 
upsetting. And we got to the 
German border, I suppose the 
next morning it was, and I 
reme mb er being very  frightened  of the soldie
rs who came on board.  And they  checked 
everything, and I rememb er particularly being 
outraged  that one of them took a piece of 
fruit from one of the children's food pack ages, and I thought, How can an adult steal from 

little children? The thing I don't remember, to
tally suppressed memory:  Apparently I had 
a small gold locket on a chain 
around my neck.  
My mother was told
 that a German 
soldier tore it from my 
neck.  I don'tI have no memo ry
 of that. I remember being in 
England some time later and being unhappy th
at I lost my neck lace, but the incident 
itselfnow, he couldn't h ave torn it; I would ha
ve been cut.  He must have taken it from 
around my neck.  But that
 was so frightening, I do
n 't remember it at all.
 
Q: Do you remember that lock
et at all?  How did it look like?  What did it look like?
 
A: I don't know.  I only rememb
er being unhappy that I had lo
st my necklace.  Lost.  But 
I don't even remember from th
at memory that I knew how co
me I had lost it, whereyou 
know, what had happen ed to it.
  Only later my mo
ther told me that my grandmother had 
given me this locket and a German soldier to
ok it from me.  We weren't supposed to have 
jewelry, apparently, I don't know.  But I've re
ad other accounts that little girls did have 
necklaces or whatever.  So 
I always found it strange that II can only remember mourning 
for it and not rememb er the thing itsel
f or the incident where I lost it.
 
Q: Yeah.  Sometimes th
at happens, though.
 
A: And then later that day I was taken to be 
in a compartment with some older girls, and 

the rest of the trip was in that comp
artment.  They tried to distract me
 
Q: Mother you a little bit? 
 
A: Yeah.  And I remember going through a tu
nnel and there was a train that I thought 
was on fire.  And I realized since it was a 
coalburning train from those times and there 

were sparks coming out of the chimney, a
nd I thought the train was on fire, the Nazis 
must have put the train on fire.  You kno
w, I blamed them for everything; the bad 
Germans had put the train on fire. And then
 we landed insomewhere in Holland, and 
there had been a blizzard and we
 couldn't proceed.  We didn't get there until after the boat 
we were supposed to  have take
n had already left, and we spentw
e got there at night again.  
It was nighttime and we were taken to this 
what looked like an imme nse hall.  And th ere 
were some Dutch wo men who bathed us smalle
r ones, and there were rows of cots, and 
we were put to sleep.  And I thought it was so
 strange:  It's daylight and we're going to  
sleep.
 
And then  they gave us a hot meal, a hot di
nner, the first h o t food we had since we left 
home, and then we were taken to the ship
 for the channel cro
ssing.  Nighttime again.
 
Q: What did you have to eat 
on the train and at that place?
 
A: I don't remember w h at I had to eat.  Sa
ndwiches of some kind that my  grandmother 
gave me.  I can 't remember what I ate, only th
is business with the piec
e of fruit stuck with 
me.  And on the Du tch end, again, I only rememb er it was hot food, and it was so nice 

because it was cold, it was winter, and that we
 had a nice hot meal, and that I thought I 
could almo st understand th ese women.  It's 
a Germanic language, but I couldn't totally 

understand them, so there wasand they seemedI d
on't know if this is a picture that I made 

later or if at the time:  I really remember th
at they were rather ro
sy looking, cheerful, 
matronly kind of wo men, and th ey  were rath
erthe one who was bathing me was rather 
dismayed at how thin I was.  Well, I was a th
in little girl, always.  
It had nothing to do 
with lack of food, I was just a poor eater 
and a very thin child
, but she was rather 
dismayed at how thin I was. The other thing 
I remember about the tr
ain trip was that I 
was afraid to ask to use the toilet.  Now, it
's impossible that I di
dn't use the toilet the 
whole time but I was afraid to ask.  So I 
only went wh en somebody to ok me, you know, 
pushed me to go.
 
Q: And who was there to ask?  The chaperonnes?
 
A: There were chaperonnes, there were women,
 but I didn'tI was afraid to ask.  And I 
think that was the reason I had a kidney in fec
tion by the time Ior a bl
adder infection.  By 
the time I reached England I ha
d a bladder infection, because probably I held my urine 
much tooso that I got sick.
 
Q: And how about the passage from Holland to
 England, the one that started at night?
 
A: I slept.
 
Q: Oh, lu cky you.
 

A: I slept.  I had a cabin mate.  Two of us 
children were put in a doubled ecker cabin, and 
we got a talk about what to do if we get se
asick and th e bag and laid down , fell asleep, 
that was it.  And the next thing I knew, it wa
s England, and we dise
mb arked and we were 
interviewed for the, you know, 
intake, whatever, and I was talk
ed to by a nun.  And I was 
afraid of nuns, and here was a nun with atal
king a foreign language.  I could say yes and 
no.  That's all I rememb
ered from my father's 
English lesson, yes and no.  Do esn't help if 
you don't understand the question but 
 
Q: Yeah, that's problematic.
 
A: And then  we were taken to Dover Court Ca
mp .  And it was still cold and snowy, and 
we were put to sleep that night.  Again, it 
was night, the next thing I reme mb er.  There 
were small unheated cabins.  You know, 
it was a summer camp.  Dover Court was a 
children's summer camp, 
and the only heat was in the ma
in hall.  There was a potbellied 
stove. But we were putwe were 
given hot baths and put to sl
eep in the small cabins, and 
the woman who was there taking care of us told
 us to rub our legs against the sheets to 
make them warm. And the other thing, she gave
 us wo olen robes to put on, bathrobes to 
put on, and we actually slept in them because 
it was so cold there. And the next day we 
walked over to the main ha
ll where the one stove was.  The little boy walking with me 
kept talking about his father's  
ice cellar, andI thought, here 
it was so cold, my feet were 
freezing, why is he talking about ice when it
's so cold? And there we had breakfast.  
Don't remember what we had but I remember
 we were organized to  dance around th e 
stove to warm us up,
 you know.  We were
 
Q: Was this your idea or did the
 
A: One of the women, you kn
ow, got us all together to 
dance until we warmed up.  
 
And then the next thing I remember was a ma
n who came to adopt a little girl w ho took 
me away.  And all the time I was talking ab
out my mutti, and they
 hadit was a terrible 
mess, you know, the paperwork on
 the adult end was a terrible me ss.  They were in a 
hurry to get children out of th
ere and the next train was co
ming and so on, and so they 
thought I was an orphan
.  Most of the children were orph
ans, and he camethis man came 
to adopt.
 
Q: So he actually really want
ed to adopt, not just to 
take you as a foster child.
 
A: Yes.  He hadhe was a Congressional minist
er, and he and his wi
fe had a fouryearold 
son.
 
Q: I see.
 

A: And I was in the easy age group to get adop
ted.  I was six, I had blond hair then, and 
so, you know, cute little girls got
 adopted rather quickly, and 
he didhe wanted a little girl 
as a sort of companion to
 his little fouryearold son.
 
Q: So did y
ou get adopted?
 
A: He took me with him.  He spoke maybe 
two, three wo rds German and I spoke my  yes 
and no.  And I also kept showing th em the addr
ess, and he wrote to this address, and he 
wrote:  To Whom It May Concern, I have a little girl, an d so on.  And my mother wrote 

back:  My daughter. She in th
e meantime had been  trying to  find out wh at happened  to 
me because none of the organizational people
 seemed tothere seemed to be a terrible 
mess at that point, and she had gotten a lette
r from my  grandmother that I should arrive 
such and such a day and nobody could tell he
r anything.  And she was just recovering 
from illness, so she was not in good sh ape to  go running around to agencies, so it was 

wonderful when  he wrote. And he actually w
ould have kept me as a foster child, because 
she couldn't keep me with her, she was a livei
n domestic, but I wanted to go with my 
mo ther.  And sh e kept saying, "I'm going to ha
ve to put you in school, I can 't k eep you."  
But I just wanted to go with he
r, so I went with my mother.
 
Q: So that seemed to have been a pretty nice family, the one that 
 
A: They were very nice peop
le.  They must be, because a
lthough I was still upset when I 
was there, because I wanted
 my mother and where is 
my mother, the things I 
rememberfor instance, I had ginger for firs
t time, and gingerit always evokes this 
memo ry, and it's a pleasant emotion. 
 So they were very nice to me.
 
Q: When  you say ginger, you mean ginger cookie?
 
A: No, just piece of  
 
Q: Just to eat?
 
A: Preserved ginger.
 
Q: I see.
 
A: It waswhen I landed, it was very close to Christmas.
 
Q: So the memories from the fost er family to be were pleasant.
 
A: They were very pleasant, 
yes.  But I only stayed ther
e for a few days becausethey 
sentactually, they sent my mother a 
railway ticket to come to them.
 
Q: That is nice.
 
A: And they had very little mone
y.  They had a doll for me 
as a present but then when 
Iwhen I wanted to leave with my mother I had 
to give it back to th em because they were 

going to  get another child and th ey actuallythey
 couldn't  afford to 
buy a second doll to 
give to th e new child. Now I understand it. 
 Then I was very, you know, inside very 
indignant.  It was a present; you don't ta
ke back a present, you know, butso my  
motherwell, I was finally able to tell my mother
 that I felt sick.  So
 the first thing, she 
took me to the doctor and
 
Q: With your bladder infection, right?
 
A: Yeah.  And then  she took me
 to the boarding school that
 she had enro lled me in.  And 
they were a school who we
re taking refugee children.
 
Q: How was your mother able to afford a boarding school?
 
A: Charity pupil.  The school
you know, she paid a little but 
she could notno, sh e couldn't 
have afforded the regular fees.  But the 
same schoola little boy who was the son of 

friends of my mother was at that school.  Bu
t I didn't stay there long because th e school 
had been an  allboy's  school, an
d they were trying as an expe
riment to have boys and girls 
together, and they decided it wasn't good, 
and theyso I had to be moved elsewhere.
 
Q: It wasn 't  work ing?
 
A: It wasn 't  work ing.
 
Q: What was the age group for the children?
 
A: I don't know.  It seemed
 
Q: Were you two youngest?
 
A: I was among th e youngest.  I seem to see 
a vast room with loads of children, and I 
learned how to eat with my ar
ms tucked in  properly, you kno
w.  You don't eat like this, 

you eat like this.  And they started trying to te
ach me to r ead.  I didn't even know English, 
you know.  It was a little di
fficult.  But I remember the bi
g fuss when I said my first 
English sentence.  I remember th e matr
on there asked me, "Eva, where is your 
handkerchief?"  And I said, "My handerchief is
 in my  coat pocket."  And I would have 
not remembered it, but she got so excited, and 
she called to a teacher close by:  "Eva said 
a whole English sentence."  "Eva, say it again. 
 Where is your handerchief?"  So this was 
a big thing.
 
Q: So actually, they must have 
been pleasant in that school?
 
A: Yeah.  You know, I rememb
er trying hard to follow th e 
reading.  What I could do, 
they had to teach arithme
tic.  They had beads on 
a piece of stiff wire.
 
Q: Abacus?
 

A: But it wasthey were individual pieces.  Like 
an abacus but individual.  So  you had to if 
you were adding, th ey gave you two and you ha
d to count how many.  So three plus four 
is seven.  That I could un
derstand, but the reading Ibeca
use I didn't really know the 
language.  But what I remember, I was not
not always happy there. I remember, for 
instance, when my mother left
 me there I againI screamed and I said to her, "I will not 
learn anything, it 's not""you s
houldn't wast e your money, I 'm 
not going to learn anything, 
and particularly won't l
earn English."  So  of course, the 
first thing I did was learn English 
in selfdefense.  What do you do? And the othe
r thing I remember th at shows I was pretty 

miserable for part of the time, at least:  
I rememb er sitting fo r hours when I hadwhen 
nobody was giving me a lesson a
nd they said I could go and pl
ay.  It was a sort of play 
room, and they had equipment 
for much smaller children al
so, and they had this little 
bench with pegs in it, and you to ok a ha
mmer and you pounded  the peg and then you 
turned it over and youI sat with thatI seem
 to  reme mb er en d l e
ssly banging and banging 
and banging.  So I must have
, you know, still been unhappy.
 
Q: Because you were parted from your mother?
 
A: I think that was it.  I mean, I w as pa
rted from everything I knewlanguage, food, 
everything.
 
Q: How was the English food?  Did you like it?
 
A: I don't remember much about it until later 
when I began to relax 
a little and things like 
kippers andvery strangeand you know  That un
happy period didn't last long, but then the 
school found another place for me because
 they were getting rid of the girls.
 
Q: And while you were still in that first 
school, were there only the refugee children?
 
A: No, no, no, they were 
mostly English children?  
 
Q: Did they play?  Did 
you guys play togeth er. 
 
A: I don'tall I rememb er with playing, asid
e from this banging on that, was there was an 
outdoor play area, and I re
member going on a seesaw, and a little boy threw a stone and 
hit me here.
 
Q: Oh.
 
A: And I couldn't figure outhe said it was an ac
cident, that he meant to hit the wall behind 
me.  And I remember wondering, Is it because 
I'm not English or becau
se I'm a girl that 
he hit me with with a stone?
 
Q: It's hard to say.  It might have been
 an accident or it mi
ght have been on purpose.
 
A: Yeah, I don't know.  But the nextI was back
 at that school briefly again for a few 
months in anotherit was a family that had a 
little day school in th e house, and they had a 

girl and a boy and I camethey took me in to 
live with them, and that
's where I learned to 
read, actually.  And I was like the third child in
 the family, sort of. It wasn 't  a boarding 
school.
 
Q: Was it a British family?
 
A: Yes, it was British family.  A nd then they 
went away briefly for holiday, to relatives, 
and they  took me back to the school to stay 
for about a week.  It wa
sn 't more than that.
 
Q: And who is your seat
 partner, do you rememb er?
 
A: No.  Another little girl, I think.  I don't rea
lly remember interacti
ng so much  with other 
children.  More with 
the adults around me.
 
Q: Did youwere you ab le to see your mo
th er often?  Was the school close by?
 
A: Not so close.  I don't reme mb er her coming 
to visit at that school.  But then th e next 
placeI think it was a fairly brief period where I 
was at that first sch ool, and the next place 
where I was with the other child
ren, like a child in the family
, I 'm b e g i nn ing  to reme mb er 
more, and there my mother could come.  
Not frequently but she cameI remember her 
coming to visit, I remember 
they helped me to make a birthday present for her, and I
 
Q: What was it?
 
A: It was a fancy handerchief.
 
Q: That's nice.
 
A: And
 
Q: Did you embroider it?
 
A: No, not yet.  Not then.  La
ter in life my mother taught me
 to embroider.  But there, I 
began to relax and my  English improved and 
I finally began to unde
rstand reading, what 
that's all ab out.  And the la
st ti me  I was changed school,
 the one where I stayed the 
longest, my  mo ther changed me only because she wanted
 
Q: We have to pause. (Pause.)
 
A: Yeah, so
 
Q: There we go.
 
A: I stayed there for relatively brief period. 
 I reme mb er being taken to a birthday party 
for another child, you know, along with 
Elizabeth and Christopherg ood English 
namesand feeling very like a princess, becaus
e I was given this fancyprobably  one of 
Elizabeth's old dresses, and I thought, you kno
w, this was it, this was ruffles.  A nd we 
went to this children's party 
and I played and had a good time.
 

Q: And those were mainly British ch
ildren then that you were with?
 
A: Yes, they were allI don't think I had an
y contactuntil the third and the final school 
where I spent the year until we came to Ameri ca, there therewas not another child while I 
was there, although I understa
nd they took in several childre
n during different times.  But 
there was alike a teacher's helper who was also
 from Austria, and I didn't  want to have 
anything to do with 
her; I wanted to be a little English girl.
 
Q: Did you speak the 
German at all or 
 
A: I wouldn't speak to her in German.
 
Q: Did you communicate with your mu m othe
r than her coming to see her?  Did you 
draw her pictures?  Or I don't kno
w if you could write in German? 
 
A: I could not write in German. 
 I could neither read or write
 because I didn't actually go 
to school at all.  I learn ed to read and write
 in England and I wrote letters.  My father at 
this time w as in France and he save
d letters I wrote to him in France.
 
Q: In English?  Letters in English?
 
A: In English, yes, in English.  But he 
knew a little English.  He knew a little b it of 
several languages so  And then oh, and then  
America, because while I was there he came 
to America.  And I wrote him:  I hope you 
like it in America andI don't know, I have the 
letters.  He saved these little 
letters that I sent to him.
 
Q: So you started integrating mo
re and being mo re outgoing after
 
A: Yes, after school I wasI wanted to be a little
 English girl.  I certainly didn't want to 
come to America.  I didn't want to be uprooted
 again.  At least this
 time I traveled with 
my mother.  By this time, of cour se, there were air raids already and 
 
Q: So what year did you go to 
America?  Do you remember that?
 
A: November of 1940.
 
Q: 1940.  And th at third school, 
wh at kind of school was that?
 
A: It was a small boarding school called the 
Mildred Lodge School, in a little town called 
East Molesey in Surrey.  So it was not very
 far from London; it wa
s mo re Hamp to n  Court 
Palace somewhere.
 
Q: Julia has been there.  
 
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:  I just went there.
 
A: So, you know, it wasn 't that
 far for my mother 
to visit.  Oh, there was one time my 
mother worked for a wh
ile forthe first family treated he
r so badly she said she would not 

go to work for rich pe
ople again, she would go to wo rk  as a general housekeeper to a 
more middle class family, and sh e worked fo
r a family where the wife was American.  
The husband was British, the wife was Americ
an, they had a little b aby, and they allowed 
my mother to have me with her for a week during the summer
 holidays.  And the lady put 
red nail polish on my  nails. When the matrons 
saw my red nail polish 
when I got back to 
school, ah, you would thinkit was shocking, 
terribly shocking.  Immediately she took it 
off.  And I thought it was so pre
tty, my red nails, and she just, oh 
 
Q: So the first family didn't allow for your 
mother to keep you fo
r the holidays, right?
 
A: The first family that she wo
rked for, they had pa
id her fare so sh e 
had to work it off, 
and she hated them so mu ch.  
All the kitchen cupboards were
 locked and the lady of the 
house had the key, and when  my  mo ther went 
to cook, she had to  come and open all the 
locks, and as soon as my  mo ther had taken ou
t and so  on, everything was locked ag ain.  
She hated it so mu ch. So  there was somebody 
she already knew in England who lent her 
the money to  pay off so she could leave them.  
 
Q: I see.
 
A: And then she went to work 
for this nice family
.  And she would have stayed with them 
but they  moved furtherwhen the bomb ings be
came mo re intense, they moved, and sh e 
didn't  want to be so far away from where I wa s going to school so she left there.  And I 
think wh at she did next, she went to wo rk 
inan Austrian restaura
nt that a group of 
refugees had started.  So she worked in 
the kitchen of the Austrian restaurant. And
 
Q: And you at that time were in that sec
ond school, right?  Third 
school, and you were 
already a little bit older, right?
 
A: Yeah.  By the timewe left 
in Novemb er '39.  I was eight
, and I could read and write 
and I was learning English hist
ory and long division and all 
those, which I hated.  And 
when  I was bad they  sent me  instead of bein
g able to listen to the teacher read from "The 
Wind In The Willows" I had to do
 long division examples.  Bad.
 
Q: It waswell, it was useful.
 
A: Yeah.  I have onemy  mo ther has one repo
rt card, the only one from England, from that 
school, the third one.  And wh en I wasw
hen you were bad you gotaside from being 
punished , you got what they called an order ma
rk.  And if you wereif you left something 
where it shouldn't be you got a confiscation mark
.  And I had three and a half order marks 
and 45 confiscation ma rks, and the note:  "T
oo untidy."  But the 
general comment from 
Miss Randall, who ran the school, was some thin
g about my  happy disposition.  So by this 
time I was already doing mu ch  better.
 
Q: Adju sting, right?
 

A: Uhu.  
 
Q: Did you have many friends in th
at school?  Do you remember th at? 
 
A: I reme mber particularly two girls.  I wa
sit was a very small school.  There were two 
classes, the upper form and the lower form, 
and I was in the lower 
form.  There was one 
child younger than me.  Poor 
little thing was five years old. 
 She was an orphan and her 
uncle sent her to the school, and she wanted
 to adopt my 
mother.  She so wanted a 
mother.  And our beds were next to each ot
her.  So I remember her.  Jill was her name. 
And I know there were two or three other 
children who were learning aroundyou know, 
we were learning about the same material an d 
that if I finished my
 work  sometimes I was 
told to help Jill with her reading, and I was 
rather proud of myself th at now I could read 
well enough to help Jill.
 
Q: Was Jill also from___? 
 
A: No, no, she was an English 
girl.  There were two nonEng
lish people there.  But I know 
there were other children that came and went 
from that school, that they took in other 
refugee children.  My mother said definitely I was a ch arity pupil because she paid a little 
bit.  Nobody ever asked her for money fo
r clothes for me, I always had the school 

unifo rms and ev erything. And I rememb er goin
g to church with them.  They asked my 
mo ther if I could go to church 
to  be, you know, with 
all the others, not to be singled  out.  
I reme mb er us walking in a line, you know, lik
e those picture books of the children with  
the round hat with th
e ribbon hanging down. 
 
Q: Like Madeleine.
 
A: Exactly.  Yeah, that's what  we looked like in 
the spring, and in the winter we had 
brown woolen coats and brown 
felt hats when we went to church.  Until the bombings 
got bad an d then we didn't go.
 
Q: Did that anywhere influe
nce your religious affiliation?
 
A: No.  I mean, if I had stayed longer I would have beco me probab ly a nice religious 

little Church of England girl but I was reunited 
with my parents.  A
nd one day I said to 
my  mo th er so meth in g  ab
out God, and she said, "Oh, we do
n't believ e that."  And I said, 
"Okay."  That was the e
nd of that, no mo re God.
 
Q: So you went with  your mo
th er, you traveled back  to Un ited StatesI mean, not back but 
for the first time to United States
 to reunite with your father?
 
A: Yes.  I remember w e left in an air raid
, by train to Scotland, to Glasgow, an d the boat 
sailed from Glasgow, and it wa
s a tenday voyage because we
 crossed in a convoy until 
we reached the Canadian waters and came do
wn, you know, as close 
to the coast line as 
possible to New Yo rk.  And we landed in 
New York, and there was my father, who I 

barely recognized.  And he started speaking 
German and I said to him, "You have to 
speak English to me, Daddy."  
So  he spoke English to  me.
 
Q: Did you speak German?  Di
d you remember any German?
 
A: I remembered a little.  I can understand so
mewhat.  Ithe first ti
me I tried to speak 
German to my father he burst out laughi
ng because I had an 
English accent in my 
German.  And so mebody who met me as an adult 
said, "You are the first perso n  I've ever 
met who has a foreign accent in ever
y language she speaks."  Which I do.
 
Q: That is pretty amusing.  So  was it a happy
 reunion with your dad?
  Did hedid you have 
to wait long?  Did you have 
to go towh en you were going 
through immigration in the 
United States?
 
A: Wethe immigration was onboard ship, th
e officer was onboard 
ship , and we were 
nearly the last ones off.  My father was alrea
dy in desp air because they said if they 're not 
processed that day we go to Ellis Island and ha
ve to be processed the next day.  But we 
didwe got processed.  And my  father bought 
me at the pier a boxmy first American food, 
a box of these cookies called Mallowmars.  I 
don'tthey are a piece of cookie, round.  On 
top of that, marshmallow, and on
 top of that, chocolate, all co
ated in chocolate.  My first 
American food. And then we went to my  uncle
's house.  We were stayingthe great uncle 
who brought us all to America, w e went to hi
s house in Brooklyn and we stayed there for 
a little while. I immediately got an ear infect
ion and ended up in 
Kings County Hospital, 
in the children 's ward.  During
 this time that I was in the 
hospital, my parents found an 
apartment in Manhattan with 
two sisters who were fellow re
fugees, and that's  where I 
started school in America and so on. 
 
Q: And so five of you 
stayed in one apartment?
 
A: Yes.  It wasin New York , the lowcost housing at that time, they had what they called 
railroad flats.
 
Q: What does that mean?
 
A: Okay.  On the street 
side is a living room.  
 
Q: Uhu.
 
A: Opening directly from the living room, no 
hallway, each room op
ened from another.  
That's  why they called it railroad,
 because one after the other.  
 
Q: Uhu.
 
A: So my parents had the living room, I ha
d the little bedroom right after them, next 
bedroom the two sisters shared, in the back
 looking on the back yard was the kitchen 
where we ate. 
 

Q: And the bathroom?
 
A: Yeah, kitchen and bathroom next to each other.
 
Q: Did you have to 
pass each other's rooms?
 
A: Always.
 
Q: So best room was your pa
rents', nobody was passing their room, or was there an entry 
to the staircase th
rough their room?
 
A: Well, there were two doors, the back doo
rkitchen door and the 
front door.  And we 
stayed there not too long, until my parents 
could afford an apar
tment of their own. 
Butand then my father join
ed the American Army when 
the war broke out here, and 
disruption again.  I think I
it took a long time until I began to be close to my father 
because of all the separation.
 
Q: What about your grandmothe
r?  Did you keep in touch 
with her?  Wh
at happened?
 
A: My mother was able to write back and fo rth for a while.  In 
fact, myfor my seventh 
birthday my  mo ther asked fo r my  grandmother 
to send some books, German books.  So I 
have four books, two school books for be
ginning reading, you know, the first two
 
Q: Right.
 
A: years of reading an d writing book, and Grim
m's fairy tales and Ande
rsen's fairy tales, 
with beau tiful pictures.  Those were 
my  presents for my  seventh birthday.
 
And then  there was nothing.  You know, first, th
e letters came to the old address, then to 
another address, and after the war, when 
the Red Cross started helping people find 
relatives, w e found out that she died eith
er on the way to Theresienstadt or in 
Theresienstadt.
 
Q: I'm sorry.
 
A: So however, unlik e mo st of the Kindertr
ansport people, I did haveI had not only my  
parents, but one set of grandparents here.  So I grew up fairly normally when  it came to 

that.
 
Q: Right.  And did you start school in the Un ited States?
 
A: They put me in second gr
ade, because they asked my mo
ther when she went to enroll 
me, "How mu ch schooling has Eva had?"  And 
sh e said, "Well, not quite two years."  So 
they put me in second grade.
  Now second grade here, th
ey were still learning how to 
read, and I was at home reading "Alice in Wond
erland" and, you know,
 real books, and in 
England I was learning history 
and geograp hy and they  were stumbling thro ugh Wilbert 
sat on the windowsill.  And I th
ink I nearly died of boredom.
 

Q: They didn't move y
ou to  an upper grade?
 
A: They did eventua
lly.  The next semester I got moved, you know, but it was very 
choppy fo r a while, you know. 
 
Q: Not very stable.
 
A: Not very smooth.  The transitions were
n't smooth because I got put ahead and put 
ahead.  Bu t it allyou know, by the time I was in middle school it was all kind of 
straightened out.
 
Q: And did you find Un ited States welcoming 
or did youhow did you see that move?  Did 
you feel upset that you have to leave Englan d?
 
A: Yes, I did.  And strangely  enough, the fi
rst time I was called a dirty Jew was here in 
the United States.  One of the 
childrenyou know, they  didn't 
know what they  were saying 
and, you know, it was justI don't rememb er what
 I said back but it mi
ght have been "dirty 
Irish," for all I know, that I said ba
ck.  I'm so rry but I have to leave.
 
Q: Thank you very much.  
 
This concludes our interview. 
 
A: Thank you.  I'm sorry.
