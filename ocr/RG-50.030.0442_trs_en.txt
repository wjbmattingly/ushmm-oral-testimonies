 us to Moest ar(ph) .  And fro m 
Moestar(ph), we wanted to sleep there, but some of them were picked up from, I 'm sure that was, 

nobody els e would have done it, it 
was the , the Usters hur( ph) who br
ought  us to Katzc o(ph).  The y  
were brought, some  of the people 
t ook us t o Katz c o(ph) and we we re
 brought in the 
morning later to 
Kat zco( ph)  and in Katzco(ph) we
 stayed awhile, but we were ve

yet, it was l at er on for us, 
much wor se, about  hunger and t his
.  But we  know wh en 
the  Ge r ma n get  us , what
 is going to happen 
to us , but we , that  ti me , it  really
, it wa s, we wer e  s o b usy esc a p i ng 
a nd bei n g int one ere d (ph) t hat we  
didn't  ha ve  much ti me  t o t hink. 

Q: Wer e  you put t o wor k, wha t  
wer e you doi ng during the days 
i f you wer en't moving fr om one  
place  to a not her, what
 wa s your day like? 

A: All right.  We didn't do much, we didn't do mu
ch, not that t i me , no.  Th
ere 's not hing, I can't, you 
know, i t 's  a  l ot I  for got , a ctuall y it 's  a lot I  for got . 

Q: So you were starting to tell 
me about when the Italians came 
in, would you tell me a little bit 
more about  t hat?  

A: We  were brought back to Moes
tar (ph) , all  right and then t o  Chap
l i na( ph), whi ch i s a s mall place  
and we all were brought to
 Chapli na( p h) a nd that wa
s a bout i n '4 2, I t hink. 
Q: So I just wa nt to ma ke 
sure, first you were in Gattsgo
(ph) and that was still 1941? 
A: Yes .  

Q: And there... 

A: And then it was Chaplina(ph), 
then it was still
 '41, I think. 
Q: But i n Gatt sgo(ph), is it in
 Ga ttsgo(ph) where t he Ital ians
 t ook over your gr oup from t h e 
Ust a si( ph)?  

A: They wer e there, they didn't 
t ook over  our group, but t he y wer e
 there so we  were safe, be cause 
they were very nice to 
us and that's all, I mean and then 
I guess  in '41, th
ey br ought us  to  
Chaplina(ph) and in Chaplin
a(ph) they were also the Italian ther
e, they were also
 oc cupied by the  
and I don't know i f you s ay occ upi ed, they were a l so
 Italian soldiers there, 
but the r e we  got to eat , 
we got to, I gue ss fro m t he communi
ty, I don't know how we got to
 eat, but they 
got  food, s o me  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0442

food, but that was already 
very, very little and we star
ted to be very, very hung
ry and it wa
s next to 
a churc h a nd I thi nk t he c hurc h wa
s a Ser bian chur ch and 
I made it at house wher
e we  were sl eepi ng 
was maybe all of them t here Ser bs 
because it  was an empt
y house, it  was a bi
g house, because we 
were all brought there and 
we al l sl ept in t hat one house, all  th
e, all the people.  One next to the 
other .   
Q: And were the Italians taking 
care of your grou
p now?  We re the Ustasi
(ph) still around you?  
A: You know, I , we didn't have a nyt hing to do t h at 
ti me wit h the Usters hur(ph) .  The, t hen, but t hey  
wer e there, I 'm quit e sure they were t h ere, becaus
e there was a t i me when I he
ar d, t he y wa nt to se nd 
us s o me whe r e and we were a frai d, be caus e one w
ho took, who was it,
 who, he was, you know there 
wa s some body who to
ok care of t he food, who tr
ied to get for us and fo
r us and he was br ought  
there and he told, not , tol d some bo
dy, I heard, terri ble thing about the pla ce they wanted t o bring us  
and I thi nk he mana ge d somehow that the y didn't , 
the train refu sed to take us, so we were not 
brought there.  But I thin
k that was the time 
when they wanted to kill us
.  But in Chap
lina(ph) they 
didn't  kill  us beca use  th
e I talian were t here. 
Q: At any ti me then, were
 the Itali ans the ones ta
king you from place to pl
ace?  It sounds like at  
some  points, some body is ta
king you fr om one 
t o wn to t he ne xt, 
is that correct? 
A: I don't know r eall y.  I gue ss we
 we re suppose d to lea ve a nd I d
on't know, I don't recall wh o took 
us, reall y.  We , I guess the peop
le who t ook c har ge of us , whic
h was  in our gr oup, some body fr o m  
our gr oup a nd, but we s t aye d a long ti me in Cha plin
a( ph), a very l ong ti me , but my pare nts a nd I 
and that my, at that time , my boyf
r i e nd, we trie d to go to _____,
 Split, you know, that's the same 
name, I, you say Split now, I thi
nk and there we went also withou
t permission.  So, because w e  
tried, because we t hought we are 
bett er off because I  thi nk the Ital
i an wer e, t here  were  only a few  
Italian in Chaplina(ph), but in Ch
apl i na(ph) t hey were shooti ng all 
the time to the mountains, I gues s 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0442

there were t he parti sans in the 
mountains.  But nobo
dy wa s shooting bac k.  The y we re shootin g 
with, how do you call it, wi th big,
 I don't  know how you 
call it, I don't know ho
w to say it.  They  
were shooting to the, to, at
 the  mount ains , but t o us the y wer e goo
d.  The y didn't do anything to us . 
The y didn't give us t he food, I 
think that was the Chaplina(ph), 
the  communit y who gave us s o me  
food, you know, that
 we  s hould ha ve  s o methi ng t o eat, 
but we  were very hungry that time. 
[End of Si de 1, Tape 1] 
Q: Mrs. Barber, you were telling 
me about the time that you want
ed to leave and go to Split, I  
belie ve you wer e i n Ca pl inja(ph) , is  t hat where  you wer e?  

A: Cha plina( ph) , Chapli na(ph) wa s the na me of it, 
yes, my fat her wante d 
t o go and we  decide d to 
go on our own and we went to 
Split and, without perm
ission, everything without permission  
beca use we coul dn't get a per mis sion to go anywhere.  
S o we we nt wit h th e boat , first wit h the trai n,  
I think, but yes, wit h the t r ain, a 
fe w st ops I t hink a nd t hen we we nt
 with the boat to
 Split and ther e 
we were about a week also and 
I started, there were fortunately 
a Jewish community still there in 
Split.  The Italian were there, th
ere was no Ustershur(ph)
 there, t he It ali an we
re ther e and what I  
started, we had, we  got food fro
m the, that time, first fr om th
e  Je wi sh commun
ity I think, or 
anywa y, we got food, I r eally don't , we pic ked 
up food li ke, like the, t h
e homel ess pe ople pic k up 
food, t hat 's what it was, actuall y 
a nd we wer e sle eping in a room, 
we had one r oom we rente d a nd  
after about a week or two, wa s 
it two weeks, I don't recall, I r
eally don't reme mb er, the Italian 
picked us up.  Actual ly, 
t hey want ed onl y my fat h er
 that time and 
my  frie n ds an d I  
was afraid when 
I, whe n I don't go wit h t he m, I may never se e the m 
aga i n, so I deci de d of goi ng t o.  Like I s aid, th e  
Italian were very good t o  
us, even when they took us to jail, they were good, they didn't wa nt me to 
take to jail and not my moth
er, but I wa s afraid of it,
 s o we we nt the r e a nd I thin k we were a wee k i n 
jail, I t hi nk a bout a we ek.  And t he n
 t hey br ought us t o pi ck up my, 
a fe w s t u f f, st u ff w hat  we ha d,

wh at we c ou l d carry , that 's all we h a d , wh at we 
c o uld carr y and then they brought us t o a boat and 
they br ought  us  to
 Dubrovni k.   
Q: I wa nte d t o a sk you, who, of your
 group, went  t o Split  at  tha t  ti me?  

A: Oh , j ust my  par e nt s, we we nt
 on our own, we  fi gur ed we are go
ing, be caus e we t
hought this is a  
better  pl ace  t o be t ha n i n Chapli na( ph) an
d so we, my pare nts  a
nd my frie nd and I .  
Q: And how long did it t a ke you, do you re me mbe r  
if it wa s a l ong j ourne y to get t here a nd how di d 
you pick Spl it, what did 
you hear about that  place?  
A: Yo u know, I don't recall, I thin
k beca use we know the It a lian ar e th
ere and I thought this is the, 
the It alian were al so i n Chapli na( ph) but  we t ho
ught it's a better place to
 go, I gues s my par ent s  
hear d about it.  I do not know, I r
eally don't know.  In 
fact I didn't even want
 to go, but si nce my  
pare nts  went , I  jus t , I 
know I had to go too. 
Q: And then it sounds like th
at you offer ed t o go t o ja
il in Split, to stay with 
your father, to stay with  
the family?  
A: Ye s,  be ca use I  was  a fr a id I ' m 
goi ng to ne ver se e the m again othe
rwise, I wanted to know where 
they a re br ought.  I thi nk now, 
knowi ng how ever ythi ng was , I  think 
it wa s a stupid thi n g to do, but 
I di d it  a nd i n t hat cas e, it  di dn't hur
t me .  I mean, it hurt
 me , I wa s in jail. 
Q: Wh at was it like
 in that jail? 
A: We had, we were sleep
ing on, on wood, a 
little place we had to sleep a
nd I could, I, I was lucky, 
I coul d slee p ever ywher e, I ca n lay down when I 
sleep down, when I, I wa
s tired, so when I la y 
down on the floor, I can
 sleep.  And we ha
d very little to eat, 
but the people who got
 food in, that 
ti me , some  peopl e got  food i n jai l  fr om
 the relatives, they 
shared it with us. 
Q: Were  ther e ot her  Je ws in jai l  ar ound you?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0442  
14 
 
 
A: No, no, I think the y br
ought , I don't think t here wer e any Je ws i n that jai l , I think the r e wer e onl y,  
I think they were politica
l people in jail that time
, because, but I don't k
now, really, I 
don't know. 
Q: What al ready by t his ti me, 
did you know of the partisan m
ove ment  going on in Yugosl avia?  
A: Not much, I not 
much, I really, I never was 
in politics in, know well, 
all I know, I wanted t o  
come out ali ve and that 's all we tried, but I didn'
t know a nyt hi ng about the  partisa n that  ti me , not a t  
all. 
Q: Di d you a t  leas t know th
at t he y a re around, did you 
hear  tha t  the y are around?  
A: I don't know.  You know, I ha d so, we ha d so mu
ch proble m on our own, tha t  we di dn't think of 
anyt hing e ls e, t han to go to t he r ight place  and t o
 come out  ali ve, which wa
s very doubtful, which I 
know now, I didn't, that ti
me I still 
was hoping. 
Q: Okay, so what happened afte
r you were in 
jail in Split?  
A: Oh, they brought us 
t o Dubrovni k and Dubrovnik
, we went  Dubr ovnik and als o t he Italian were  
there in Dubrovnik so it wasn't bad, the only thin
g was bad, we always had 
very little to eat and we 
rente d a home that ti me al so.  I don't e ven knowhow we pai d for the room, 
when you a s k me now, I  
don't know, I really don't  know.  But we re nte d 
the room and then it was 
a short while that I was  
worki ng for ,  in a restaur ant, I wo
uld say and wa sh dis he s.  So that ti me  I had to ea t, bec aus e I  
wa she d dis h es and my parent s, I real ly don't 
k no w, ma yb e so meti mes we 
got so methi ng from t he  
Italian, some ti me s you c o uld buy so
mething from t he sol diers  a nd you 
could sell it, wh
ich my father  
did a nd t hat 's all and my  mother 
was cooking that time 
and we we re eat i ng whe n, wha t  we ha d to 
eat was really very little
, but we had some horsem
eat and some fo od
, which we got also fr om the  
Italian, whic h we bought  fr om t he It a lian from, they
 made some kind of busi
ness wit h the m, it 's not  
really a business, just
 to have fo od, that's all,
 that's all I reme
mber.  Oh, then I 
started knitting for a 
store i n Dubrovnik, ye s, I starte d kni t ting for a st
ore.  Thi s was just , you know, to kni t swe aters ,

ho w mu ch  mo ne
y c oul d you ma ke , when I coul d get  so meth
ing, I was glad abou
t that, that was a 
little bit to help us out. 
 And that's all, th
at's all I remember 
in Dubrovnik and af
ter that, the whole 
group fr om Chapli na( ph) wa s se nt t o
 Dubr ovnik, to a place , at  the s a me
 ti me , we we re  also sen t  to a  
place, from t he Italian to actuall
y it was like a hot el, not used as 
a hotel a n y more , a e mpty place  
where we c o uld, c oul d, wh
ere the  gr oup li ved and they
 ga ve us r ation t ha t  ti me
.  Ration, is that th e 
right word to say?  They
 gave us ration th
at time, very little 
food, but something 
so we can, we did 
survi ve .  For insta nce  my par ent s were ol der , mu
ch older, so they got d
ouble rati ons, whi ch wa s 
better .  Then, lat er on t he y br ou
ght Yugosla v J e ws ther
e and t hey had some 
money, but we didn't  
and they could support them a little
 bit better and so, so
me people who 
didn't have 
anything were 
even waiting what they l eft on t he pl ate, but I neve
r went tha t  low down.  
Not , not my pare nts a nd 
not  I. 
Q: Were  you ver y hungr y 
while you were there?  
A: Yes, of course I 
was very hungry.  Yes,
 of course I was ve
ry hungry, but 
I wa s al so, you
 call it in 
Italy, you say, car bini eri, that we co
uldn't go out fr om t hat pl ace, we 
wer e locked up in that place,  
we were not  allowe d to ge
t out, but it wasn't
 a ba d place , but  ot her t han 
we wer e hungry and, and, i t  
was right on the ocean i n fact , th
e pl ace, but we was terrible hungr
y, we, that was a horribl e ti me 
and so I was knitting for the same 
place, where I was knitting in Dubr
ovnik, I was kn
itting and I got 
about two pounds, not, yes two, ab
out two pounds a week
, beans.  She sent 
it in for the knitting , 
what I was knitting the whole day and 
maybe a half a night in
 order to get that in
, to supplement, t o  
suppleme nt my, the fo od we ha
d.  I don't know wh
at t hat 's, what should I t a lk about? 
Q: Wh ere did you get the mate
ri als to do your  knitt ing?  
A: Oh, t hey sent it i n wit h the car bi
nieri(ph), they send it in, they br
ought  it  out .  The y s ent it i n for  
me because I was knitting when I wa
s in Dubrovnik, for them
.  And they were sending it in and they

wer e s o ni ce , the Itali an, the y se nd it  out , onc e a 
wee k a nd that 's what I did a nd it  wa s reall y not  
mu ch to suppleme nt, but 
that 's what , t hat 's t he 
only thing I could have. 
Q: In Dubrovnik, it sounds like yo
u wer e worki n g, you were worki ng 
in t he r esta ura nt  and you wer e 
doing this knitting, was 
there any other place where you di
d any type of work like that? 
A: Very little, it's was ve
ry little, it was almost nothi
ng, just to keep us goi
ng that we don't starve 
compl etel y.  Bec ause we  didn't  ha ve  a ny money, 
we di dn't ha ve  anythi ng
, that's  what we  did. 
 Q:  And you wer e  all o we d 
to work in the restaura
nt or  was  that at all  da nger ous  at  tha t  ti me?  
A: I don't know, we didn't ask 
if I wa s allowe d, I was onl y, 
I was ma ybe a fe w weeks washing 
dishes, that 's all.  
We , wh o was, we didn't ask 
i f we are all o wed or not. 
 We were not allowed to be 
anywhere , t h at ti me , we  wer e
 not  all o we d t o be  ali ve. 
Q: Di d you have  any clos e call s?  
A: No, no, t he Italia n were ther e.  
Not that ti me.  I heard, when we 
wer e  in that pl ace, I, that one 
time  the German wanted to
 come  in a nd l ook how we li ve d, but as
 far , I wa s tol d, I don't  know what  
is true  or not  true , but I wa s tol d the y want ed t o 
come i n a nd they di dn't le
t them come in.  But I' m 
sure, you know, they know about our, be
ing us t here , of cour se.  That 's
 all I can tell y
ou, that's  all I 
re me mb er.  

Q: So where  wer e you when you we re stayi ng 
in this hotel and that 's where the large... 
A: It 's not  really a hotel, but 
it , it was an empt y pl ace where we co
uld sleep.  I t us
ed to, it was an  
old, an old hotel. 

Q: So t his  ol d hotel , wher e was  thi s?  

A: Thi s was  near  Dubrovni k, ab
out , I woul d s ay maybe a ha lf an
 hour fr om Du brovnik, I don't 
know, I don't, you know, I was brought ther e, I 
don't re me mb er how long it 
took t he m  to bring us  
there, so I don't know.

Q: And this is where the ot
her  J ews, t he other fore ign Je ws  wer e br ought , t h is... 
A: Yes, yes, yes, t hat 's where t he 
als o  other Je ws wer e br ought.  A
nd this, that partic
ul ar ti me, t his  
wa s t he bes t  pla ce t o be  brought, 
because the It ali an were t her e.  Th
e y wer e act uall y sa ving us ti l 
that mo me nt , a c tuall y.  
Q: Wh at yea r  was  thi s ?  

A: I think that was in '42, in '42, I think, I thin
k it  wa s in '42 a nd we were
 there long time, but we  
wer e hungr y and li ke I s aid, we j ust survi ve d from
 one day t o the next , but the y di dn't do anyt hing 
bad to us .  Yes, some  people wer e c utt ing wood
, some  men, you know, a 
fri e nd of mi ne wa s c utting 
wood and he got
 a little bit more, fr om the b
one, what was le
ft on the bones they
 could take off and 
got , got , s o t hey had a li
ttle bit more to eat. 
Q: I re me mber you wer e sayi ng, at a di ffere nt ti me
, some thi ng about a n encounter you had with a n  
Italian detective, I believe? 

A: Oh, that, he j ust , he j u st, whe n
 I was walking in Dubr
ovnik, he wa s seeing me
 and he said, I, and 
I didn't rec o gniz ed hi m, but he 
s aid, I know you fr om t he jail  you 
went , Split , that 's , he was ver y  
nice.  They all, they all , t he Itali an, that ti me, 
t he y wer e ver y ni ce to us.  Even, eve n bei ng a nd goi ng 
through what we went 
through, I still think 
they were very nice. 
Q: And whe n you we re i n the ol d hot el, ne ar Dubr
ovnik, you met up with a 
lot of people who you  
kne w be fore , pe opl e fr om this  other  gr oup?  

A: Oh yes , from the ot he r group, 
from Chapli na( ph) wa s br ought th
er e and t hat was 
the same time 
we  were  br ought t here  too a nd 
we we re in there , t oo, t h
at was the whol e gr oup, ye s. 
Q: Was the group still mo stly in
tact, or do you know if ma
ny others went
 elsewhere?  
A: No, that time, I think, most of 
the people were, I really, I'm not 
100 per cent , but I think most o f  
them were all right, that
 ti me .  I me a n, other t han the y wer e
 hungry and we, my
 parent s were one

ti me  heavy and they got  so ski nny
, t hey were bones and 
s kin, beca use  they didn't  ha ve e nough t o  
eat. 
Q: Di d you or your  pa rent s 
get very ill at
 any point? 
A: No, no, no, not that I recall. 

Q: Di d ot her  pe opl e ar ound you get  il l? 

A: Some of t he m di d, yes , some of
 the m did, some of the m di d, but 
I, you know, it 's so long a go, I  
really, I don't recall everything. 

Q: Wh at were the rations th
at you wer e gi ve n, wha t  
was a typical day of food? 
A: Very litt l e, what we g ot, I 
couldn't tell you, a little bread, you 
know, a s o up whic h wa s ma de with 
the dr ied ve getable and that
's all, really I don't know, I couldn'
t  tell you wha t  we got , but  I know we  
wer e hungr y, but  I c oul dn't  tell  yo
u what we got  there, I forgot. 
Q: Wh at were you doing ev
er y day when you wer e sta ying at t he old hotel?  
A: Knitting, I was knitting 
day and half the night in order to ge
t those two pound of beans, which I 
got, in order to have a little bit so
mething more and my mother did th
e same thing, sh
e did the same  
thing, so t hat 's, it 's ver y hard 
t o re me mb er a fter  s o  man y year s,  
everyt hing, it 's al
most impossible. 
Q: What happened ne xt?   

A: I n '43, t h ey br ought us wi th 
a  boat , the  Italia n brough
t us, all of us, with 
the boat  to Robb( ph) or  
Ar bay( ph) , I  don't know how you s ay it, but it 's t h e 
sa me pl ace .  It wa s a ni ce boat, t hey were ver y  
nice , they br ought us  to
 Robb( ph) a n d thi s wa s a ,
 actually it was a concentr
ati on ca mp a nd act uall y 
we had t he s a me be ds I have s een her e , what t he y
 had i n the conce ntrati
on c a mp, we ha d the sa me  
beds, downstairs and upstairs, but th
ey were nice to us, but we had ve
ry little to eat, li
ke all the time, 
that 's was our.  So they ask us that  time, if my
 mother was sewing someth
ing, the y aske d me  i f I 
want to sew something a
nd then I got a little bit more fo od.  
And so did, you know, my friend got,  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0442  
19 
 
 
he was working, he was cutting woods and so he got
 a little bit more of food,
 too.  But it was still,  
we 're hungr y, I  mea n t h at 's , we  di
dn't get e nough, but  the It alian, 
the soldiers, all 
the time, when 
they have s e en chil dre n, they gave the m e ven, some
ti mes some of t heir food, 
part of it, really, but 
not to us, because I 'm tal king about children now, because some people had 
little children, very few,  
but some people had littl

Q: Was it very crowded in
 this camp, on Robb(ph)? 
A: No, they expected more people
 t o come i n, they ex
pecte d much more people , it wa s not cr owde d

my pare nts were sle eping on the

Q: Were  you abl e t o s t ay near  your  pa rents  at  all ti me s?  

A: Oh ye s, we were sta ying toget h

yes , then of cour se, t hey, then, the Ita lian capita
lit(ph), capitaleat(
ph)?   How do you 
pr onounce it?   I 
don't know how to pronounc e it well
.  And t he It al ian le ft  and t he 
camp  wa s without anybody.  And 
we  ha d t he c hoic e  t o st ay

and t he othe r one se parat e, we ha
d nothing in common, bu
t I know it was there 
and the Italian left 
and so we left to the city of Ro
bb(ph) and were sleeping there a little
 bit and then we decided about,  
we didn't know where t o  go, so we 
went to t he mainla nd of Yugosla v
ia wi th a boat .  Some people  
wer e smart enough and left to __

until we could sleep somewhere an
d over there it was, partly, th
at part where we went, it was 
occ upie d by the partisa n , be cause ot her wise the 
Ger ma ns would have got t en us, we would ha ve  
bee n kil l ed.  And some  people 
went  a di ffere nt directi on and then I  never he ard about the m a ny  
more.  Some  pe opl e st aye d in the c a mp a nd I hear d 
eve rybody i n, who sta ye d 
there, t hat didn't  come  
out alive, tha t 's what I hea r d.  And, and we we re
 esc aping and es capi ng and s o meti me s we got some  
food from t he peasant because the 
partisan were there and I  don't 
know what to say, what else , 
ma ybe you wa nt t o 
ask  me  s o met hin g.  
Q: Wh en you were at Robb(ph) s
till, in the concentrati
on camp there and the 
Italians capitulated, 
wh at did you know, or wh at did 
you hear about  the war at  t hat 
ti me , ha d you be en heari ng a l ot 
about t he war? 
A: We didn't  read the pa per, we 
coul dn't rea d the  pape
r an d we wer e , we  hear
d, we hope d tha t  we  
will be saved, but we did not
 know.  Of course we di
d not know.  I k
now the Italian le

what I  heard that t i me, really, 
I forgot.  I c oul dn't  tel l you. 
Q: How di d you de cide  t hat you 
ne eded to lea ve Robb( ph), before
 you knew, I 'm ass u mi ng you di d 
not  know tha t  the  Ger ma n s were  c o mi ng 
there, how did you decide to leave? 
A: I gue ss I hear d pe opl e  talking, we hear d pe opl e  ta
lking a nd we didn't know
 i f  we s h oul d go or  
not , but t hat 's what we deci ded,
 wh at the group of 
our people deci ded to do.  The re was not  
knowi ng, be caus e  when we  
would ha ve known somet hing, a l ot of
 people would have  bee n sa ve d,  
but we didn't know what we  sh
ould do a nd wha t  we  di d, it 
wa s just l uc k, t o c o me  out. 
Q: Ho w l a rg e was  th e gr oup  o f  
you t hat deci de d t o le ave?  
A: Maybe it wa s 100, ma
ybe it was 150, I don't know,
 I really don't know.  
We went for the boat  
and it was a small boat and we wer e
 esca ping a nd esc api ng and e sca pi

Q: How were you able 
to take this boat?

A: Eve n that  I coul dn't tel l  you. 
 I don't know, I really don't know. 
 I don't know how 
it was paid fo r,  
if it was paid fo
r, I don't know. 
Q: And then you did a lo
t of wal king, onc e you got
 ba ck to the  mai nla nd?  
A: Of course, we walked and walked, constantly wa
lking.  And one time, we
 were in a village and 
we  di d not, we  were sta ying ther
e for a whil e, it  wa s ta ken over by
 the partisan.  I mean, the whole 
thing was taken from the par tisan
, because other wise I woul dn't be
 here, but , what was I goi ng to  
say, it's, when they, I want
ed to say that we got to a village and 
we had to, we heard 
that we have t o  
esca pe a nd my par e nts wer e  insi
de and, no, they came
 outside and my fath
er sai d he forg ot  
somet hing a nd we were  waiti ng a nd waiti ng he sh
ould c o me   out and e verybody was esca pin g  
already and we were 
scar ed and we di
dn't s ee my pare nts  and I  was  sc
ar ed.  They ma y have  le ft an d 
we nt a not her  way.  So we de cided 
about it, we going.  So I went 
wit h a  fr iend and we wal ke d a nd  
other pe ople  we kne w al so, fr om ou
r  group a nd we wal ke d, but we 
did not know where , we jus t  
walked and then later on, we came
 to a little village, which was also 
from the partisan, like.  I think 
it was a Serb's  village, 
I don't know, but they to
ok us  in and regi stere d 
us, so I think it was the 
partis an, regi stere d us i n t hat vil lage a nd it j ust 
happened t hat my par ent s we re, hear d our  na me a nd 
were also going the sa me  way and 
so  that 's  whe n we  fo un d my p a re
nts again.  And then we wer e  
staying there for awhile and then we had to leave 
too and I think that time , we, I think we  had to 
leave, we were told to leave.  There was a time , th
ey were ve ry nice to us , they gave us food.  We  
had, that time, we were not even 
so hungry a nd we ha d to l eave th
e people who wer e ar ound t here , I  
don't know t he reas on, but I think, you hear that tim
e , you he ar d that ti me , you have to leave , so we  
left.  Our  gr oup l e ft, it wa s a gr
oup, I  don't know how ma ny pe ople ,
 I  couldn't sa y, but  ma ybe it wa s 
100.  Anyway, we left.  Th
ey were not all in thatone village, but we found th
em anyway and we left  
and we walk ed an d wa lk e
d, we di dn't  know, it wa s snowi ng, it was terri ble snowi ng a nd we walke d

and wal ked and wal ked and s o me pe ople of c our se, 
ha d ver y bad fee t .  I wa s one of t he luc kies , I  
still had the good s
hoes and they still were go
od that time, but we went
, that time, 
we end up in 
Chapli na( ph) I t hink, that
 time, I think so.  Let me
 t hink, I don't  know i f... 
Q: Was this in the wi ntertime?   Of 1943? 
A: I t hink, when we wa lked
 and esc ape d that ti me , that I, not on
ly I t hi nk, I know i t  wa s wi nter , it  

wa s snowing very hard and I don't 
know eve n how we c oul d have go
ne t h at ti me, beca use we didn't  
know where we coul
d sleep, but we went and th
en we end up to a village 
and I think that was near  
Topos co( ph) , I 've , whe n I 'm not  wr
ong, it  was  Vookavit ch( p h) a nd 
we coul d sl eep t h ere and for a 
whi le, we were sleeping there a
nd t hat I do r e me mber a nd t hat wa
s near  Topos co( ph), or was it  
Topos co( ph) ?   And l ater on we went t o Toposc o(ph),
 t hat I do re me mber a nd 
t hat wa s all oc cupie d  
by the partisan and then it was, or was it that
 we fir st we nt to Topos co( ph) a nd then to  
Vookavit ch( ph) , I r eally do not  re
me mb er,  ma yb e, no , n o ,  
no, I t hink fir st  to 
Vookavit ch(ph), then  
to Toposc o( ph) .  We ha d lice t hat t i me , we we r e , 
you know, run down.  We 
were afraid of lice, 
because we hear d that so
me pe ople di ed from Typhus a nd you kno
w, that 's how you 
get it, from the  
lice on the  cl othe s, but we
 trie d t o get  as clea n as pos sibl e, ev
e r y mo rni ng  we  were  
looking for lice. 
And we were sleeping in 
Vookavitch(ph) on the floor of course
, and we had very little to eat, I  
remember my mother made spinac
h that time, from le
aves and very little to
 eat, but, 
you know, 
wh en we ha d so me thi ng ,  we t oo k s o meti mes s o met h
ing out fr om our stuff what we had, what we  
carrie d, in order to get s o me food, you know, e v
erythi ng would ha ve be e n worse , a lot of money, 
for, not money- wise , I mean for fo
od to get , that 's all, who care
d,  nobody had money t h at ti me, we 
just were looking for food, but we
 had very little clothes to exchange
, we had very little, but once in 
awhile we took some thi n g out to 
ge t somet hing to eat besi des  what
 we got from the partisans and 
what els e di d we do?   We ha d, t he n we went a l
so to Topos co(ph) a nd i n Toposc o(ph) and fro m

Topos co( ph) , we went to, no, that 
time they went 
Toposco( ph) and we, that 
ti me, Churc hill 's son, 
but I don't know if Churchill was 
there and the German we
re bombing Topos
co(ph) for that reason. 
And we al so had escaped there...

Q: Mrs. Barber, you were telling
 me about being in 
Toposco(ph), will you te
ll me a little bit more? 
A: It was , we got fr om, I  gues s it was  fro m t he pa r
tisan t hat we got some f
ood.  We we re, tha t  ti me  
we were not  so hungr y, but we  ha
d not muc h to eat, we wer e in, 
livi ng i n, you know, in a roo m 
where we all  slept, we 
di dn't ha ve di ffer ent r ooms  you know, but
 a fe w pe ople wer e sl eepi ng there . 
And duri ng t he day, s o meti mes t he Ger man airpl a
nes came and we wer e 
s cared.  And near by was  
mountains and I escaped, most of th
e  ti me  I was during the da y ther e, i n or der beca use , I wa s a frai d  
they may bomb Toposco(ph)
.  But later on I 
remember, I mean I know th
at Randolph Churchill was 
there, so we felt safe 
alr eady, but  we he ard that  we have  to
 escape because I 
guess the Ger man  
wa nte d to ta ke over that place , be cause of that .  
I think he had to escape th
e sa me ti me and I ' m, I 'm 
sure he di d, so we di dn't know 
where we wer e wal king and wal kin
g and wal king and we, I think t he  
name of the mountains was Petrov
agorra(ph) and we wer e sle e ping 
ther e for a fe w da ys and it wa s, 
the peasant  came t here and some pe
ople had some t hing a nd we  were
, s o me people  took a coat a n d  
in or der t o get a gl ass of mil k.  It
 was that bad.  But after a fe w da
y s, whe n we wer e  i n the , i n th e  
Petr ova gorra (ph) , we we r e back t o, I t hink it 's Vook
avit ch( ph) or to Toposc o(ph) we 're bac k, no to 
Topos co( ph)  we we nt ba ck, not t o Vooka vitc h(ph) , 
I  for got  tha t, I  reall y, but anyways, Toposc o(ph)  
and Vookavi t ch(ph) is s o  nearby 
that yes , no, to Toposc o(ph) we
 we nt bac k, it was ma ybe a not her  
ti me , I reall y  don't, I don't re me mber , so I shoul dn'
t say, I thi nk.  So, what 
else I should tell you, I 
don't  know wh at. 

Q: Well wha t  was your next me mor y of where yo
u were , whi che ver plac e  it was , what  was goi ng 
on ne xt?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0442

A: We were a long time in To
posco(ph), I don't recall exactly ho
w l on g  we wer e  an d this I do  
re me mber a nd t he n we  went  to
 Gleena(ph), which is also, I 
think it is 13 kilometer fr o m 
Topos co( ph)  and my, my pare nts wer e
 that ti me i n Toposc o(ph), but
 I was  in Glee na( p h) and I wa s  
onl y hopi ng, you know, duri ng t he ni
ght , we hear d bombers going to, 
goi ng to wher eve r  the y we nt, 
to Ger many, to Hungar y, whatever
 a n d we  were  s o glad, bec a use  we
 wer e  hopi ng that  pretty s oon 
the war  is fi nished.  That 's
 all I can tell you. 
 Eve r y day was, we were scar
ed to be, you 
know, to be 
killed.  But of course, not fr om th
e, from anybody else, we were s
cared that German
 may take over, 
that was t he  story. 
Q: Di d you have  a l ot of c onta ct wit h partisa ns?  

A: Not really, but  they 
helped us, because when th ey woul dn't have bee n ther e, I wouldn't be he r e. 
Before, there were the Italian, then
 it was the partisans.  But we di
dn't ha ve  any co
ntact whatsoever  
then, t he y ga ve us food, t hey ga ve
 us  some  food, you know
, to live.  And they 
gave, the y br ought us 
to peasant homes where we were 
sle eping a nd they had to gi ve 
us food.  Not much, but anyway, 
something to survive.  And when
 you ask me now 
how I survi v ed, I really 
don't know how, how we 
coul d sur vive without  mone y, 
without anythi ng, only with
 hel p  from ot her  peopl e. 
Q: I want to back up just a little bit, when y
ou were coming from Robb(ph)
, back to the mainland 
and it sounds like there we
r e many small  places t hat
 you traveled t hrough an
d I, I don't expect you 

to reme mber  the exact
 na me s of e ach place , but  what wa s it  
like going fr om place 
t o place?  Wh ere 
wer e you st aying each pl
ace  and how long, da ys, 
wee ks, wer e you tr aveli ng be fore get ting to 
Topos co( ph) ? 

A: We were  walk in g an d wal ki ng a
nd I reall y don't, s o meti me s we we r e stayi ng wit h pea sant , we 
wer e wal king, we wal ke d, but  we di dn't know wh
ere we can sleep and t hen
 when they found the 
place where we could 
la y down and sl eep, it  was  j u
st a fl oor  of course , we 
wer e glad we coul d sl eep  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0442  
26 
 
 
on the fl oor , because that 's all we
 di d, I mean they, they di dn't ha
ve beds that ti me, there was no 
beds.  We  never thou
ght s o, whe n we  had stra w, 
I think you call it straw an
d they had straw once in 
a blue moon, that wa s rea
lly something good to sleep
 on, but mo st of the tim
e on plain fl oor.  And 
the villages we went thr
ough, some of them were, most of them
, some of, most of them, some of 
the m, were bur ned out hous es, s o we  couldn't go in
 in those burne d out houses , we could not .  S o  
we were looking for something wh
er e we coul d sl eep.  And when 
we found someth
ing, we stayed 
awhile, as long as we could, til we had to escape 
again and we know, that 
time, when we get caught, 
that we ar e  not goi ng to be a live ,  so, but no
body kne w whi c h wa y to 
go.  A l ot of people  
disappeared, we never know, we ne
ver heard anything an
y more a bout t h ose pe opl e, beca use  they 
didn't know where t o go, or maybe 
t h ey stayed at place where we l e
ft and t hey got caught from t he 
Ust ers hur( ph), Ger man, I don't know 
who kill ed t he m.  The y wer e not 
bett er than t he Ger mans, they 
wer e j ust , I  c oul dn't s ay j ust as ba
d be caus e I  don't know, but  I  t hink s o. 
Q: Wal king fr om plac e 
t o place , how large of
 a gr oup wer e you?  
A: We ne ver  count ed, but  I think it 
wa s 100, some t hing in that order , 
that ti me alr eady, beca use that  
ti me  I t hi nk a fe w pe opl e  were j ust  di sappeari ng, a  
few stayed i n Ro
bb( ph) and they ne ver ca me  out .  
Not as I know.  I was told that 
eve rybody who sta yed was  kill e d. 
Q: And so perha ps a group as lar ge 
a s 100 of you, were arri ving to a 
small village and then trying to  
fi nd a place and ma
ny pl aces to stay i n t hat village
, is that how you
 wer e goi ng about?  
A: Oh,  we  wer e  parti ng , e ach , 
you know, in a di ffer ent  pl ace an
d di ffere nt , s o meti me s we  found a  
school, you know, but when it was sm
all places, I think they were slee
ping four or fi ve, in a village 
and the others were sleepi
ng in another village, th
at's how they were.  Bu
t in Toposco(ph), they 
wer e alre ady a big, bi gger  group t oget her, bec aus e we
 s t ayed i n Topos co( ph) , bu
t then I went also to 
Gleena( ph) and there were a few 
people fr om t h at place who were 
at Gleena( ph) and there was a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0442

ti me  whe n i n Glee na( ph ) , we co
uldn't even go out fr om Gleena(
ph) be ca use t her e wa s Typhus in  
Gle ena( ph)  a nd the y didn't let anyb
ody move  out of Gle ena( p h), so 
we  sta yed in Glee na(ph) , whic h  
is near by Topos co( ph) , a l so a s mall , I don't thi n
k you c all it town, but ma ybe t hey c al l  it town, I  
don't  know.  I don't know wh at else, what shoul
d I tell you, what else
 should I tell you? 
Q: Were  you ver y a frai d of being caught  
as  you were goi ng fr
om place t o pl ace? 
A: Yes.   We , we  were  ve ry s car
ed, but I always was hoping, I wa s 
hoping it was, 
actual ly when I  
think about i t  now, I t hink it wa s 
silly to hope to come out alive,
 but I wa s hoping. 
 An d when I wa s  
sleeping in, in the woods 
one time, I was thinking, when the Germans come
 in, I will kill me, I don't 
know if had the courage to 
kill me, but I thought, I'm 
going to cut my veins, 
just not to come in a 
ca mp.  I , I s a y the Ger ma ns,
 it 's also t he, the 
Uster shur (ph), it 's  just as bad,
 as far as I know.  I think 
the, the, I don't  know, but  I 
t hink t he y wer e.  The y wer e not  bet t er, t hat 's  for  sure . 
Q: Were  you he aring mor e a bout c o
ncentrati on camps at t his ti me?  
A: We know when we get caught, we
 will be killed, 
that we all know
, that we all k
now, so we were 
esca ping a nd di dn't 
know wh ere to go. 
Q: So you e ncount ered partis ans  
al ong t he way and peas
a nts  and wer e peopl e 
pretty friendly and 
helpful to you? 

A: Ye s, they we re, but you know, I 
t hi nk some of t he peasant s didn't 
even know who we
 are.  I don't 
think t hey know t hat .  I don't thi
nk i n thos e pl ac es t hey know who Je
wi sh people are. 
 I really don't 
think so.  In cities they
 know, but in those sma
ll places, they didn't kno
w anything. 
 We were 
wa shi ng our sel f a nd the y  thought oh, thos e people  mu
st be dirt y beca use t h ey ar e was hi ng t he ms el f.  
The y, t hey wer e reall y peas ant s, pe asant s in the, 
they di dn't know a nyt hi ng, I 
don't think s o.  I don't  
know what, what else  s h oul d I  
tell you?  Wh at do you wa
nt t o ask me a que stion?  
Q: So t he n you ca me  to Topo
sc o, at about  what  ti me wa
s this, this was still '43? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0442

A: Ye s, t hat wa s '43 , I thi nk it wa s '43  beca use we
 didn't s t ay t o o long i n the  ca mp, I thi n k that was  
all '4 3, t his wa s the most  dangerous 
ti me '43, t o be  caught. 
 Tha t 's, t hat 's it a nd, but I t hink whe n the ,  
when Churchill was there, 
Randolph Churchill, I thi
nk that must have been already in '4 4, that  
wa sn 't '4 3 a n y mo re.   Bec a
use  I don't t hink he was th

ow, t he y we r e  bri ngi ng  
hi m ther e wi th a, wit h a airplane, 
wit h a small ai r plane, t hey had a fi eld t here, wher e, not real ly a 
airport, but I mea n a fiel d where , when the weat he
r was dry, they c oul d land.  But als o , they were  
sending something for the partis
a n that ti me , clot hes  a n d s o, 
you know, because that, in the 
begi nni ng I t hink they di dn
't ha ve anythi ng t o we ar, I t hink t h ey
 were  not wea r ing, t he y di dn't have  
clothes to we ar, t he y didn't ha ve  anythi ng. 

Q: Wh at kind of contact did 
your group or
 your fa mily have wi

A: We tri ed, not I, but my, e ven
 my, I mea n my father a nd pe opl

tried t o be in cont act wit h  Churc hill , i n or der t o

and they di dn't  even speak, 
I don't , you know, t he y  di dn't s pea k it 
and they wa nted to
 go out, but t he 
people from Yugosla v, al so the Je wi s h people , the y
 didn't let them out , the 
partisan, but the people 
wh o c a me fr o m Au stria or fro m s o
mewhere else, wer e bor n somewher
e el se, t hey wer e allowed t o

oke English, one spoke French, this

 the partisan that we are allowed 
to get out, because even they had

 Gleena(ph) and 
that was the group which 
tried to get, you know, 
out from, fr om Toposco(ph)
 to, to the coast, to
