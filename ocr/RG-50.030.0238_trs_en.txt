Q:  Tom, could you give us just a sense of your
 family background, a little bit of where you came  
from.  

 

A:  Well, I came from Budapest, Hungary; my 
fa ther had eight Œ seve
n brothers. There were 
eight brothers altogether
. And my mother had 12 sisters a
nd brothers. But I didn't know them. I 
knew only one of them because by the time I wa
s born after World War II Œ World War I, I'm 
sorry, there were only one of my mo
ther's  sister alive. And my fa
ther, he had brothers, and some  
of them died in World War I. And as I me ntione
d to you, big family, they were. Now, what else 
would you like to know? What my fa ther did?  
My father was photographer, and he wa s the 

official photographer for the Hapsburg fa mily, was 
the king that time . And after that he was the 

official photographer of Admi ral Horthy
1
 whom he knew from World War I, from Vienna. They 
were together in the so-called ﬁwar mi nisztérium.
2
ﬂ And he had a very well known photography 
studio in Budapest, at that time , for t he uppe
r class, princes and barons and so forth.  
 

01:03:06 

 

And besides it also, he wa s a high society 
photogr apher, let's put it, in shor t.  

 
Q:  What was his name?   
 

A:  Paul. 

 

Q:  Did you learn photography with him?   

 

A:  Yes. I grew up in photography, and I had a br
other of mi ne who was also a photographer, and 
Œ but he was 11 years older than I am. And I 
learned photography from my father, which his 
fa mous saying was, "I'm not teaching you. You ju
st watch me ." I was just watching him. And 
when he died, he was right, because I knew most
 of it from hi m. Naturally, I had studying, but 
the actual photography I learned from hi m;  ju
st watching. Be sides, sp
eaking about photography, 
he was most ly doing portraits, studio portraits, and 
he wanted to Œ me  to go out and do outside 
work, which I loved to do. As a 
ma tter of fact, I didn't want to
 be a photographer until I was 15, 
and that's when I Œ excuse me  Œ that's when I 
had the feeling that I wa
nt to be a photographer. 
And he also had a photography shop; small, 
elegant photography shop 
with cameras. And I 
decided I want to be a photogr
apher. And I took the first came
ra, which was a Leica from the 
shelf. And he wasn't  there, but he just came in 
and he said that, "What are you doing? "  I said, "I 
want to be a photographer. I took this camera I'
m starting with." He t
ook the camera out of my

hand; he put it back on the shelf. He took the olde
st camera that exists which Œ not with films, 
with plates Œ and he said, "That's where you start,
 with the oldest camera.
" He said, "If you want 
to know photography, you have to
 start from scratch."  
 
Q:  What kind of photography di
d he do for Admiral Horthy?   

 

A:  He sent to do Admi ral Horthy Œ I don't know i f
 you've ever seen his pictures. They were done 
by him and he did his portraits. Also, he did all 
the new Œ well, that wasn't  personal for Admi ral, 
or the new Secretary of State or Secret
ary of Wa r or this or that, you know?   
 

01:06:00 

 

The official photography for the cabinet. Later 
on, I was quite young, he sent me  up to do it.  
 

Q:  What was the impact, then, given the Ho
rthy's position obviously ch
anged with the Nazi 
move me nt into Hungary?  What happened in terms 
of his work and the re
lationship to Horthy?   
 

A:  Nothing happened. It was going on until quite Œ the end of the war. I mean, end of Horthy. I 

have a funny story to tell you if Œ 
I don't know if it belongs
 here or not, but as I said, every time  
there was a new cabinet me mber, he was called 
up until ma ybe I was 16 or  17, he started to send 
me up to the palace to do the picture. So one 
morning, he got the call, and that was during the 
war already, ma ybe in the mi
dŒ around 1943, I would say, which was 
close to the end of the war 
Œ but we didn't  know that then Œ that the ne
w Secretary of Wa r will be  comi ng. They changed, 
because Hungary was starting to get slowly out of
 the war. So anyway, he got the phone call to 
send Œ to go up. So he said, "In the afternoon you 
have to go up to the palace to do the new 
Secretary of War." I said, "I cannot do it." "Why 
not?" I said, "Because" Œ it'
s hard to explain it, 
at that time  in Hungary from the early '20s
, there was a so-called paramilitary. It was a 
paramilitary organization which you had to go. It was a must. And they were practicing every 

week outside  the outskirts of Hungary, no Budape
st. So I said to him, "Because I ha ve this 
obligation." He said, "The hell. You don't go there.
" I said, "I have to, because Œ Okay. Then ask 
the head of there what you have to do and he will
 release you." All right. So I went out there, and 
there's a train, tram, and at the beginning you had to 
Œ is it interesting at a
ll, what I'm saying?  At 
the beginning you had to go to him and ask for 
permission to leave. He said, "What is the 
reason?" I said, "Because I have to take the pi ct
ur e of the new Secretary of Wa r." He  looked at 
me  and said, "You." I said, "Me."  

 

01:09:00 

 

He said, "Well, I let you do it, be
cause that's  the biggest lie I ha
ve ever heard. I'll let you do it. 
But you bring me  a paper where you have been
 Tuesday afternoon between 3:00 and 5:00," 
because that's Œ So I went. I did the pi ctur es. A
nd after the pi cture taking, I knew he was the head 

of the cabinet, mi nisztérium for PR
 and so forth, and I went to hi
m in the building, and I said, "I 
need the paper that I Œ he was laughing, and he 
gave me  the official paper of the Hungarian 
cabinet stating that Thomas Veres was, be
tween 3:00 and 5:00, taki
ng picture of the new 
Secretary of War. Next time  I showed it to him,and he flipped. That's the end of that story.

Q:  Tom, could you give me  some  
sense, then, of the first impact 
of the Nazis when things began 
to change.  
 

A:  We ll, certain things did begi
n to change, and don't call it "the 
Nazis," because actually Œ wait. 
You call Nazis the German Nazi
s or the Hungarian Nazis?   
 

Q:  That's  a good question.  

 

A:  I know. That's  why I'm asking. Which one do you want? Because that was two different 

period. Because Hungary not necessarily was on th
e German s i de, and the historical background 
come s out now in today's days because of Wo
rld War I mi stake when the biggest part of 
Hungary was taken away. And Hitler was the on
ly one who was supporting, because he hims elf 
was Germany's leader, to get back what was taken 
away. Now, I don't in history Œ I have to give 
you the historical background, which I think it's 
important because that made Hungary on the 
side of the Axis.  

 

01:12:03 

 

And that ma de Horthy on the side of the Axis, because Hungary's  part was taken most. Now, 

today, and in recent history, when Yugoslavi
a's breaking apart, one and a half million 
Hungarians were living there, th
en the Ruma nia, the Transylvania was taken away when two 
million Hungarians lived there, and just two days
 ago when Czechoslovakia, Slovakia, the upper 

part of Slovakia was Œ the lower part of Sl
ovakia was mostly Hungarian, a million and a half. 
And that was the reason. And they were not Hung
arian. It was a first on
ly rightist government, 
and then it became more sliding to the right, mor e
 to the right, and at the end it became  a Nazi 
government. But it was not a Nazi government 
until October Œ even then it wasn't  called, 
because the Germans oc cupied Hungary in 
March 19th, 1944. And from March 19, '44, Horthy 

lost his power. He was just a figurehead. And 
in October 15th, when the governme nt was taken 
over, those are the Hungarian Nazis. Then it 
became actual Nazi government. Does it answer 
your question?   

 

Q:  It's a good background to it all.  

 

Q:  So you came from a Jewish family; correct?  

 

A:  Yes.  

 

Q:  So there must have been some  danger at
 some  point that had an impact on you or your 
photographic activities were not 
exactly normal, I presume.  
 

A:  No. In all honesty, you know, there were Je
wish laws which started in 1939, I think. But 
there were one, two, three different kind of Jewi
sh laws. But, personally, I was not affected by it 
direct. Not the photography, and not in personal lif
e. But you knew what was comi ng. At least 
you thought you knew what was coming.

And, let me  put it this wa y. My brother, who wa
s 11 years old Œ 11 years older than I am, he 
ma rried an American which was accidental. It ha
d nothing to do with Jewish or not Jewish. And 
he came to the States in 1939. And two days later 
or three days later, ac
tually, he was called up 
for labor camp, to serve in labor camp. But he wa
sn't  there. I was there. Except the bad rumors. 
There were people who were affect
ed; but, personally, I wasn't .  
 

Q:  We re you ever called in to labor service?   

 

A:  Yes, I was. It was after the Germans 
came in. 1944, they came, 19 Œ March 19, and I was 
called up April 7th, 1944. I went. Wh
at happens is a long story, but 
I went to the upper part of 
Hungary, and I Œ I was sent to the huge camp 
for Œ which was for only putting together the 
different outfits and sending either
 to Russia or Yugoslavia or Œ I ha
d the luck of the fate that I 
was sent to a city, which was Œ Miskolc is 
the name , and I was there from March Œ no, from 
April to August. And in August, another luck of 
fate was that I was sent Œ the whole outfit was 
sent to Budapest. And I worked in a Œ it's 
a wood factory ma king ammunit i on boxes until Œ and 
that was from August till October when the Hunga
rian Nazis took over. And that's  when this 
outfit was Œ the word came  that the outfit is se
nding Œ was sent to Germany. And I said goodbye.  
 

Q:  How?   

 

A:  How?  I knew the captain, and by then we had Œ I don't know if you read it or Œ we had 

exemption for my father and his whole family for  the Jewish laws.  

 

01:18:07 

 
And I was in the labor camp but not as a Jew. 
Exempt and wi th different armband, and I was in 
very good friendship with the captain. And I sa
id to the captain, "Goodbye. I'm not going to 
Germany." And I was stepping down to the left
. And that's when I went to Wa llenberg,
3
 who I 
didn't know it exist, to 
the Swedish legation.  
 
Q:  How did that happen?  How did you 
come into contact with Wallenberg?  
 

A:  My father's studio, which I 
told you, did also foreign legati
ons, people and so forth. And he, 
at least three years before, two years before, 
he took picture of Per Anger, who you me ntioned. 
AndŠ 

 

[Technical conversation]  

 

Q:  All right. So let's just 
start again with how you came to 
make contact with Wa llenberg.  
 

A:  Yes. My father took his family pictures. 
He wa s a young ma n then, Per Anger, and his wife 
and little baby and it's about. I would say, two year
s before, this happened. And he also bought a 
Leica camera at that time, and I was teaching his 
wife how to use the camera because of the new 
baby and so forth. And then, I have seen them 
we ekly as Œ not friends, but in a friendly

atmosphere. I Œ every week I Œ we used to live 
in the Œ it's a well-known building in Budapest, 
the Gerbeaud palace, or  the Gerbeaud building, whic
h was the most fa mous confectionery in all 
of Budapest. And in the war, naturally, there 
was not too ma ny chocolat
e, and I got a box of 
chocolate every week, which I gave  to his wife, wi
fe, because  she loved it. And when I actually Œ 
and it was an escape from the labor camp, though I t
ook it easy and I call it 
I just stepped aside. 
I, you know Œ all I knew, my father also had the Swedish passport because he had Swedish 
friends.  

 

01:21:00 

 

And very little, because I wasn't  too much in 
contact by then with them, but I was able to go 
home . And he told me  about it. He told me , "You
 have also Swedish passport." And that gave me  
the idea that I go, when I escape the labor camp, 
to Œ right away, next morning, to go to the 
Swedish legation and look for Per Anger. Now, 
the way it actually happened was there were 
hundreds of people, that was on the Buda side, 
hundreds of people waiting in front of the 
legation asking for the Swedish passport. But the policeman didn't let them in. So some how I 

worked my way to the policeman, and I aske
d him, " Would you please send a me ssage to Per 
Anger that Thomas Veres is here and would like 
to speak to him." In about a half an hour, 
some body c a me  out, two other policemen, and s a
id Œ ma de on the loud speaker announcement 
that everybody should immediately 
leave the territory of the 
Swedish legation, imme diately, 
except Thomas Veres. And a cold sweat was co
mi ng down. And they let me  in. And I me t Per 
Anger, and he said, "What can I do for you? " I sa
id, "Look, I just left the labor camp, and I'm 

asking you what you could help." "Oh, I intr
oduce you to Ra oul." And a young ma n came in. 
"Raoul," he said, "this is Thomas Ve res, fr
iend of mi ne, photographer." "Oh, yeah. You will be 
my photographer." And in ten mi nutes the official 
paper was made out that Thomas Veres is the 
official photographer of the Swedish legation of Hungary. And 
Wa llenberg signed it, and he 
gave it to me. I never used that pa per because  
it wouldn't me an anything 
at all. But he said, 
"From now on, you will be my photographer, an
d you will do documentary what we are doing 
here for the outside world to show what's happe
ning. You will report directly
 to me" Œ not to the 
usual people who were working on the passports
. And that's how I became  his photographer.  
 

Q:  Do you know Œ  

 

A:  Did I know what?   

 

Q:  What you were getting into?   

 

A:  No, I did not. I did not. As a ma tter of fact, I 
was a little bit skeptical Œ not a little bit. I was 
quite skeptical to Œ ﬁhow am I going to take 
pictures? ﬂ  And slowly, 
I learned my lesson.  
 

01:24:00  

 

First I did, as I told you before, many of the act
ual passport pictures of people who needed it for 
him, not for direct, not for the pe
ople. What we did when he did 
save people and they didn't have 
the Swedish papers, we reversed the action. I did 
the pictures. In the meantime, the officers did

the passport, and the two were together. It was 
a post-issued passport, 
which didn't say it, but 
that's how it happened. When the actual 
Œ Can we  stop here?  I'd like to drink.  
 
[Technical conversation] 

 

Q:  Did Wa llenberg tell you why he 
wanted a photographer with him?   
 

A:  Yes. Reme mber, I told you that he said for 
docume ntary to show to the outside world what's  

happening, in his words, as a documentary. Now,
 I started saying if I reme mber that one 
morning, which is November Œ end of 
Nove mbe r , I think it was either 27
th
, 28th or 28
th
, 29, in 
the morning, because at that time  my parents we
re still in the Gerbeaud 
house in our old home. 
And I went home  to sleep. During the day I was 
with the Swedish legation, what I told you doing 
passport pictures until then. And then one morn
ing, early morning Œ he used to start early 
morning, so did I. Even up to today. I was ther
e before seven o'clock or 6:30. And a small, 
handwritten note wait for me . And 
his secretary said, "Tom, Wallenb
erg sent this note to you." 
And the note said that "Wait" Œ "Come out to
 the Œ meetﬂ Œ no, I'm sorry, "Meet me at the 
Józsefvárosi Pályaudvar," which is 
the train station at th
e outskirts of Budape
st, and it's a freight 
station, not for the public. I have 
never been there. And I went 
out by train, and I get there and 
the whole train station wa s surrounded by Hungari
an gendarmes, and there I was with a came ra 
in my pocke t with Wallenberg's note.  

 

01:27:00 

 

He was quite, I call it naive, of those dangers. 
Even if he realize it, he tried to some how 
mi ni mi ze it. So I went to the first gendarme  and 
I started to say half Ge
rman, half English, half 
Hungarian, trying to imitate I'm from the Swed
ish legation and I want to go in. And the guy 
looked at me  like, "Who wants to go 
in this place?" So I talk my Œ I had to talk my way in there. 
I didn't show them any paper. That would be th
e worst. My mouth took me  in there. And the 
train station had about 10,000, 15,000 me n, Jews, r
eady for deportation. They were the ones who 
were surrounded fr om Budapest, the labor camps, 
who were still at that 
time, end of November, 
sent to Germany by train. Later on, it was on foot. 
This time  it was by train, for deportation. And 
Wallenberg was there and set up a little table. And 
I went to him and he whispered in my ear, 
"Tom, take as many pictures as you can." I di
dn't want to ask him " Will you pose for me" or, you 
know, "How?" So I had my coat on me  and I had a 
shawl, and I always have a pocketknife with 
me , and I made a slit in the sh
awl and prearranged the camera sett
ing on my Leica, and I just Œ 
through the shawl I did bring ju
st the lens out and started, 
through the shawl, shooting. 
Some times I was sitting in his car and shooting 
from the car, and some ti mes I just went around 
looking left or right like
 nothing happened and take the pictur
es. Up till Œ first of all, some body 
was yelling to me , "Tomm
y, Tommy." It was not my 
best, but one of my best friends with whom 
I was in school from first grad
e until the end of my 
schooling. We  were sitting next to each 
other. So I didn't want to be recognized, a
nd I whispered to him, you know, "Do something." 
And I kicked him in the butt, and I said, "Dirty 
Jew. Go over there," in 
Hungarian; that the line 
was standing for infor mation to
 give that you have Schutzpass
4
 or not, because that's what 
Wallenberg in a big book had to ve
rify it, ﬁyes, no, yes, no.ﬂ

And he was trying, naturally, also for the ones who di
dn't have it, to say ﬁyes,ﬂ and go to the left, 
go to the right, go to left, go to right.

Q:  Tom, as you pick up on your 
description of that, could you 
me ntion some thing about the kind 
of danger that you faced and what the danger of taking photographs was.  

 

A:  That's self explanatory. What I wanted to
 follow-up, the next thing I heard, again, "Tommy, 
Tommy." And this was a first cousin of mi ne. And the same  thing happened. I went to him. The 

idiot start, "Tommy, Tommy." I said Œ I kicked hi
m in the butt, too. "Dirty Jew. Go over there." 

And the third one, which I reme mbe r , I can recall
, I saw in the line. He wa s a very well known 
Hungarian actor, theatrical actor. And usually he 
played farmers. He was a Jew, but he played 

far mer, Hungarian farmer. He was very good. He was 
standing in the line. And he didn't have Œ I 
went to him, and I whispered to him. He didn't 
have the passport. So I went to Wa llenberg, and I 
whispered to him, "That's a fa mous Hungarian ac
tor, well-known Hungarian actor.ﬂ He let him 
go, you know. He looked at the book; ﬁyes.ﬂ The inte
resting part of that one was that ma ybe two 
or three years later the same  actor who was ag
ain in the theater came 
to my photo shop. And 
naturally he never saw me before. And I said 
to him, "Have you been in the Józsefvárosi 
Pályaudvar?" And he said, "Yeah." And I said
 to him, "Do you know who was the one?" He 
didn't Œ He looked like he didn't believe me , that I was actually the one who saved his life. But 

he was nice, but then, nothing special. You asked 
me  about if there was any danger. So that was 
the second Œ I was there two days, and th
en this kind of deportation start.  
 

02:03:06 

 

From then on they started taking people on f
oot. And on the second day, there was a friend of 
mi ne, too, in the car. And while the procedure wa
s going on, and taking picture, "Let's see what's 
happening behind the train." And we slid behind 
the trains, and they were already ready and 
closed. All you saw in those li
ttle cattle wagons, you had cl
ear windows with wrought iron. And 
hands were sticking out and yell
ing and crying, "Help, help." You 
heard people, "Help me  out. I 
give you 100,000 pengo," and this and that, and "I ow
n a coffee house here." So it was a terrible 
thing, because you only heard it. So
 with my friend, we slip clos
er to the wagon and start Œ it 
opened ama z ingly easy. It opened up. Started to
 open one door, and people slowly Œ the wood 
panel which they walked up was still there, and 
slowly they started to come  out. And we were 
trying to tell them to go to the other side; 
that's where the proce
dure is going on. And didn't 
notice in the big excitement that slowly wh
ispering, "Hungarian police officer." I'm saying 
"Hungarian police officer," because in the whol
e thing there was only one German involved, and 
his name  wa s Dannecker
5
. He was the right-hand of Eichma nn
6
 who wasn't there that time. The 
rest of it was Hungarian gendarmes. The German, 
Dannecker, he just stood there silently like 

he's not doing the whole thing. And the couple 
of Hungarian higher-up, and he was a captain, 

and he noticed me  and started yelling in Hunga
rian, "Stop imme diately." And then pulled his 
revolver, aimi ng. Meantime, Wallenberg came over 
too, some how, luckily. With the car, they 
pulled over and pulled up and said, "Jump. Tom, ju
mp!" I would have gotten the Olympic record 
for this, because I jumped so fast that I jumped 
in the car. And we closed the door and pulled out.

They were yelling after us, and that was the last
 time  we went there. 
Wa llenberg said jokingly, 
"We cannot come  back here." So that was 
the Œ that showed a 
little bit of danger. 
 
02:06:00  

 

Next, your question.  

 

Q:  How long had you been working with Wa llenberg by then?  I mean, it's hard for us to 

understand. This is compressed into a few weeks.  

 

A:  My whole affiliation, in lifetime, it's very sh
or t. But it was some how one of my Œ one of my 

longest time. It was actually, 
I can tell you, October 17 when I me
t hi m fi rst Œ I think it was 17. 
Either 17 Œ I know. I can tell you another danger 
that has nothing to do with the legation. Yeah, 

it was October 17, until I have seen him the last time January the 14th. Yes. And that's the whole 

period. You asked me  that; right?  

 

Q:  Yes. And from the time  that you me t with 
him in the mi ddle of October to the end of 
Nove mber you were talking about
 at the railway station Œ  

 

A:  Uh-huh.  

 

Q:  Œ was that the period of his most intense act
ivity of Œ of going to th
e places of deportation 
and pulling people back from Œ  

 

A:  Not only that. Other instance, which just 
give you one idea Œ First of all, the Swedish 
legation had a place under somebody's command
 which was called Schützlingsprot okoll,
7
 which 
is in German. I don't know if you speak any Germ
an. It 's  called Schützlingsprotokoll. In that 
young me n were having all kinds of uniforms starti
ng from priest to soldier to Nazi. And when 
they came in for help, these young me n have been
 going out like Œ as 
I said, depending on the 
situation, in certain uniforms a
nd trying to bring people out. No
w, that was not Wa llenberg's 
personal, but it was under his comma nd. It happened that one of the houses Œ I did ma ny things, 

you know. When, for instance, the International Gh
etto was built, I'm sure you heard about it, it 
was called the International Ghetto, where not on
ly the Swedish but diff
erent other legation who 
had imitated the Swedish success, Swiss, Vatican 
and so forth. And was Œ a certain part in 
Budapest was called the Internat
ional Ghetto which was under prot
ection of different legations.  
 

02:09:06  

 

And when there was need for it, I wa s there for 
a day to try to get people in, because all the 
people who lived there, had to go out if they we
re Christians, and the Jews  were comi ng in under 
Swedish protection or any other protection. Th
ere were Œ because the plan of the Nazi 
governme nt was Œ Hungarian Nazi governme nt was, up till then, from March 19–. Look, if I'm 

telling some thing you heard before, then stop me .

A:  Up till March 19, start Œ they did not put th
e Jews in ghettos. They na me d certain houses 
yellow-star houses which was mostly occupied by
 Jews. But that was all over Budapest. Certain 
house was, the next house wasn't , and they werecalled yellow-star houses. Now, the plan of the 

Hungarian Nazi governme nt was, at the end, to em
pty all those houses and put them in the actual 

ghetto, which there was a ghetto which was not done
 and not established, actually, by the Nazis. 
It was its own ghetto like in every European c
ity. Mostly for the very orthodox Jews. And they 
lived there for years and years. But as I said, th
ey were concentrated Œ 
it was concentration by 
little. Fi rst in houses, and then to put them in th
e ghetto and then to kill 
the ghetto. That was the 
plan. Now, the Swedish or International Ghetto
 was these people with passports. And not in 
those, but in one of the houses which was a ye
llow-star house, I was with Wallenberg, and the 
phone said that one of the yellow-
star houses had been taken away
 by the Arrow Cross, which is 
the Hungarian Nazis. So Wa llenberg
 said to me , "Let's go." And I went too, not as photographer, 
but as interpreter. With him I spoke either Germ
a n or English. I knew a little English. And we 
arrived to the house, and the house wa s empt
y. And I don't know what floor. There was one 
Arrow Cross officer who was not only Arrow Cross, 
but he was Œ it is hard 
to translate it from 
Hungarian. It was a Œ a certain organization of 
the Arrow Cross, to put it this way, who was 
designated strictly for killing.  

 

02:12:03  

 

So this captain was there fr om the Arrow Cross, and Wallenberg told me Œ I was the interpreter Œ 

"Ask him where are the Jews," because there 
was nobody in the house. He  said, "In the Danube." 
"Ask him why." He said it as na tural as he can, 
"Because they were dirty Jews." He also said, 
"They were swimming in the Danube
," yeah. So he did not only 
go out Œ when he got Œ there 
was help here needed, he went out. Now, he saidto me  that, "There is nothing we can do here," 
and we left. Next question.  
 

Q:  Did he go to the Danube?   

 

A:  Pardon?   

 

Q:  Did he go to the Danube?   

 

A:  No. Wh y?  For what?   

 

Q:  I don't know.  

 

A:  No, no, no. That was over. No. He said to me , "We cannot help here," so .....  

 

Q:  It strikes me  that you were all actually
 very young, younger than we think looking, say, at 
Wallenberg's pictures. Could you talk some thing 
about your Œ the youth of
 the people involved? 
How old wa s Wa llenberg?   

 

A:  He was born in 1912, so thirty Œ can you co
unt?  He was born in 1912. So 32. Yeah. Yeah, he 
was 32. Now, the people involved, except that 
organization which I told you that Œ the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0238  
11 
 
Schützlingsprotokoll, they Œ all 
of them were older than I wa
s; yes, quite older. And the 
technicality, because it was a big 
organization and a fantastic orga
nization; very well organi zed, 
issuing the pa ssports. Now, his idea was to ma ke
 them, because the Germans Œ and that was not 
with the Hungarians;  mostly with the Germans Œ they
 like legality, and he wanted to ma ke it real 
legal. And all his speak
ing with the Hungarian 
Nazi governme nt or with the Germans, he was 
proving Œ in other words, it wasn't  just a piece of 
paper. It was all the documents behind it. Like 
if it called Œ it was needed Œ ex
cuse me  Œ Swedish connection. Th
e Swedish, the letters, proving 
the Swedish connection have been 
all documented with each passport. 
 
02:15:00  

 

Against that was the Swiss legations organi
zation who had issued to anybody, without any 
paperwork background, which that's why it took aw
ay a lot from the Swedish organization in 

legality. And Œ and also, it was not recognized. 
Or if it was, it was 
not recognized like the 
Swedish. And the reason for that was, that he was 
a good ma n, but he did not 
take as part in it. 
His name was Lutz,
8
 who was the Swiss legation's Œ head 
of the Swiss legation. And he did not 
take part just Œ as Wa llenberg did, bodily a
nd in mi nd. So the  Swiss legation was called the 

Baross utca, and anybody Œ and there would be crowds
 there. When there was Œ sooner or later, 
they just started up without any paperwork. Now, 
to some  people this was right; to some people 
this was wrong. I don't know if I underŒ I ma ke
 myself understand why, but behind the Swiss 
legations, which was not in the Swiss legation build
ing Œ it was in the Baross utca, it wa s called 
Œ was mostly the Zionist move me nt. They were 
under the cover of Swi
ss legation doing Œ they 
were mostly Zionists.  

 

Q:  It strikes me that a lot of what Walle
nberg did, because he  was acting so quickly and 
improvising actions all the time Œ  
 
A:  Yes.  

 

Q:  Œ depended a great deal on, as it must ha
ve for all of you, speaking different languages, 

taking each day or each hour as it 
came . And also what you're referr
ing to, it seems to me  that he 
understood the nature of the N
azi respect for bureaucracyŒ  
 

A:  Yes.  

 

Q:  –and he took advantage of it.  

 

A:  Yes.  

 

Q:  Will you talk about that?  

 

A:  Yes. You said it right. Now, you're me ntioning
 with all different languages, as I said, mostly 
it was either German or English. 
And most of the people around him 
Œ I forgot to tell you when I 
me t hi m first he asked me , "Do you speak any othe
r language?" And I told him, "Yes, German."

And that's when he said that, "You'll be my
 photographer." The organization had, as far the 
office work, they were people mostlyŒ 
 

02:18:00 

 

- and there was a big electrical a
nd light bulb and radio factory in
 Budapest, and they were the 
head of that company. Because they were one 
of the first ones who Œ because it was partly 
Swedish owned, if I reme mber right, the factory. 
They were the first ones who received Swedish 
passport. Now, those passports were actually 
original Swedish pass
port, like you say an 
American passport. The Schutzpass idea came only 
after that. So there wa s a difference. And 
then I Œ one day I took pictures of that group. He
 asked me , and he told me , "This is for P.R. 
purpose. I wa nt to se nd it." And I Œ it was very legitimate beca use he want ed to show his 

co-workers. And I think you have th
at picture. That was people I still reme mber the name s, and 
they were from that factory. And they were head 
of this Œ it wa s a big organization. And as I said 
before, I don't want to be repe
titious, it was well organized.  
 

Q:  What was it like to work w
ith Wa llenberg?  What was he like?   
 

A:  I'm saying it now, and I'm saying that for years, and some how I Œ just the other day I found 

out, and I wa s amazed, because my idea of him wa
s, and is, that he was like the Scarlet 

Pimpernel. Even his ma nners was Le slie Ho
ward; were very low key, not ostentatious. 

Some times [gesturing]. He was a very low ke
y, very good looking Œ not 
great, but good looking 
young ma n. But to me  he was always the Scarlet Pi
mpernel. And just the other day Œ I don't want 
to go into the source, but his sist er is saying th
at, and I didn't know that. I'm still puzzled because 
it happened a few days ago. His sister, I don't know
 if you heard about her, they were in the 
movies in the early '40s in London, and he had aproblem always, he wasn't  doing what he liked 
to do. And they saw the Scarlet Œ it
 wasn't  the Scarlet. The second, 
Mr. Smith
?  
 
02:21:00 

 

You know, the second, which Leslie Howard play
ed when he was going to Germany with a 
crew. You never heard of that movie?  And he is 
a British professor, and he's  helping Jews out 
from Ger ma ny. 
Pimpernel Smith
, that was the movie's title. And supposedly he came out from 
the movie with his sister and sa
id, "You know, this is what I would like to do." And in just a few 
days later, I experience that. So, that says 
how he was; right?  That's  how he was.  
 

Q:  Did he give Œ  

 

A:  But he was, at the same  ti me , very firm in
 his Œ in his saying what he is believing, but not 
bossy. Firm. And I still didn't make up my mi nd what
 to call it. Wa s he brave or naive?  Because 
it looked like that he did not know fear. To give 
you an example Œ That wa
s not the last time. It 
was beginning of January. I think 
it was the eighth. Almost at th
e end, because finally Russian 
troops came in Budapest on 15
th
, whatever. He told me  one afternoon that, "Tom, let's go up to 
the Buda side to the mountain and let's see where 
the Russians are," just for fun. All right. He sat 
in the car, and we had three paid gendarmes
 who were paid by the legation. You know, they 
were our people, with machine guns on the side 
sticking out of the car.
 And the siege was going 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0238  
13 
 
on. I mean, all over, bloody soldie
rs and shooting. And we go ove
r Œ it had to be the eighth 
because after the third the bri
dges were blown up a day later. 
And we can go over to the Buda 
side up to the mountain, and we
 step out from the  car, and 
the Russians were on the next 
mountain shooting over here, and we
 were at the guns shooting ove
r there. And we stepped out 
and we took pictur es. I took pictur es of hi m, 
whi c h I never ha d because it was gone. And like Œ 
you know, like a tale, a fairy tale 
standing there. He said, "Let's
 take pictures," and we took 
pictures. And in the meantime the war was going on around us. Now, if that was braveness, I 
don't know; or naivete, I don't know. The fact is th
at while I was there, I didn't think of the 
danger. 

 

02:24:00 

 

He took you with his kind of thinking. Took you with
 him. And we'r e just trying to give a little 
pictur e.  

 

Q:  Did he ever talk about 
his reasons for his actions?   
 

A:  No. That was obvious. But, for instance, he 
liked small jokes. And he had a friend with me  
there, and we'r e sitting in the car. He said, "I
 feel like I was kidnapped 
in the States." And I 
thought he was joking. Right 
after the war, in his life history, 
I learned that he was here in Œ 
going Œ in the States going to university; I don't 
know which one, Chicago, or whatever. And he 
was not actually kidnapped but he was robbed on the 
way of the Œ and he said, "I feel like." And 
I thought he was kidding, and he
 wasn't . Now, about his work, why no, there was no question 
about it. It would have been 
just lost time  to speak about
 it. Not to me , at least.  
 

Q:  He seems to have given a lot of courage to other people.  
 
A:  Yes, he did, for instance, to me . Can we stop a little?   

 

Q:  Sure.  

 

A:  Or you said six mi nutes.  

 

Q:  No, that's  okay. That was before.  

 

A:  That was before.  

 

Q:  Do you need a drink?   

 

A:  Just a little relaxation.

Tape 3  
 

03:01:00 

 

Q:  You were asked whether you were sleeping in
 your own home  during pa
rt of this time .  
 

A:  I have been sleeping in my 
home  all Œ all right. I have to th
ink back. Fi rst of all, it happened 
just the day when, after Œ hold on 
a second Œ after the Nazis took over 
and I was still in that labor 
camp. And I wanted to know, because I had the ri
ght from my captain, as I told you, to go home  
and sleep. And that weekend, when the Nazis took
 over, I was home. And then I had to go back 
to the camp, and I was there for two days, or 
a day. But I was quite concerned what's happening 
to my parents because the Nazi government took 
away the exemptions which Horthy gave. They 
nullified it. So I Œ another offi cer with whom I was well, fr iendship, I told him and he said, "I 'll 

come  with you. I do have, anyway, some  pictures to
 develop and that will be a good excuse." So 
we went to the Œ my par e nts' 
home , and I started to 
develop. He came wit h me in the darkroom, 
looking at this and that. And s
uddenly, the bell started non-stop 
ringing, the doorbell. Now, that 
was a big place, you mu st understand. It wasn't  onl
y the studio. It was the darkroom. It was the 
living quarters are all in
 a big place, like t
op penthouse or some thing. 
 

03:03:00  

 

And I was in the dark in the da
rkroom and I heard voices, "We ar
e looking for the Jew who ca me 
in." That was me . Now, nobody would call me  a 
Jew because I didn't have my ar mba nd, so 
some body i n the house who knew me  reported it. So 
in the dark I was still de velopi ng. I took off 
my ring, I took off my [gesturing]. I knew they came
 for me , particularly. 
And it wasn't a Jewish 
house. So when I finished up the development, 
I didn't want to ruin, but my heart was pounding. 
So I go out and there is my friend, the officer
, Hungarian army officer he was, and three 
Hungarian Nazis from t he Arrow Cross dresse
d in Arrow Cross uniform with machine guns, 
with hand grenade, with revolver;
 name  it. They were arme d to 
the [gesturing]. And they started 
to questionme. So my friendthe officer,army o
fficer, pulled his revolver
 and said, "He's with 
me  and nobody is harming him. He's  doing work fo
r the Army." And then 
I recognize. One of 
them was working downstairs in that confecti
onery store. And he came to me  quite Œ he 
recognized me . Said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know 
hi m. He 's  a good Hungarian boy." And he left 
because my friend pulled his revolver. They were 
playing with the hand grenades like this. After 
the war, a year later I was ju
st shooting in my studio, and a 
detective came with some body. He 
said that this guy was arrested; that he kill
ed I don't know how ma ny Jews, and "He is calling 
that he saved your life, and he 
wants your help." I went down. It
 was the Hungarian Arrow Cross 
guy. And I said, "How many people?" He said, "H
undreds of people. He 
was taking them down 
to the Danube." What would you do now?  I'm as king you the question. What would you do in 

my place? Because he was calling me as a witness 
that I save his life. 
Answer me . What would 
you do?  That's one occasion I'm asking you a question. 

 

03:06:00  

 

And I saw Œ Whether I wa s right or wr ong, I said, 
"I never saw him before." I figured he ma y 
have saved me  Œ he was not the guy. It was my 
fr iend, the captain, who sa
ved my life because he 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0238  
15 
 
pulled his Œ how do I know how ma ny hundreds of other people he killed?  Okay. That's  Œ I 
wanted to tell this because ever si nce, if it co
me s up in me : Did I do right or wrong?  I could have 

saved the life maybe, but my testimony, I cannot 
go against the other pe
ople who he killed Œ 
that's number one. Numb er two, he was not ac
tually the one. He came to me, because many 
times I went through this, after I 
was already saved, after he pulle
d the gun, after he said then 
"Get out of here," my friend. So the question wa s Œ Yeah, I slept home then. Now, aft e r the train 

story, Wa llenberg told me that, "I need this very
 fast because I want to
 send it with the next 
pouch, diplomatic pouch, to Sweden." "When do you need it?" "Tomorrow." So I went home, 

sleeping. During the nighttime I print it. And th
is is why I don't know how ma ny Œ I know I 
printed 12 prints of each. And there were a lo
t of pictures. And I took the pictures and the 
negatives, and it was already getting dark, and 
I knew he was Œ Wa llenberg was waiting for me  
at the legation. And I was, at th
at time , mostly dressed not ex
actly, but similar to the Nazi 
uniform. I had boots, I had black riding. So Œ I di
dn't wear the armband. So I had the pictures, 
and I went, naturally, on foot to the legation from
 my parents' house. It was getting dark, and on 
one part of the trip was a narrow street, and I 
have seen people asking for identification over 
there, and they were Arrow Cross people. So I 
went to the other side. I was zigzagging until I 

reached the big square, and by th
at time  it was really dark. And that Arrow Cross guy was also 
asking for Œ but I was too late. He wa s that clos
e, as you to me  now. And with a lamp, he was 
putting the lamp Œ you know, s mall lamp with ba
tteries. Fl ashlight. You 
see?  Flashlight, and 
asking. 

 

03:09:00  

 

And there was some body just showing his identifi
cation. So I had to ma ke up my mi nd. If I stop 
and go this way, he would shoot after me . So I ke
pt going, and when I reached him, the pictures 
were in my left hand, I said the Hung
arian Nazi salute Œ like ﬁHeil Hitler,
9
ﬂ ﬁÉljen Szálasi.
10
ﬂ 
And he greeted me  back like this
 [gesturing], and I kept
 going. And when I 
told Œ I reached the 
legation and I told Wa llenberg what happened. I wa
s still out of breath. And he told me , "Tom, 
this is getting really dangerous, so from now 
on you give me  all the negatives undeveloped and 
we'll take care out there." So that was the last 
time I saw these pictur es an
d the negatives, and all 
the other negatives that I did later. Now, I s
till didn't answer the question how long. So one day 
shortly after this, which had to 
be the beginning of Dece mbe r , the 
fighting was Œ and the air raids 
were so heavy that I Œ but the phones were up to 
the last mo me nt on. So it was so heavy fighting 
that I called my parents. "I can
't  get through." It was really ve
ry dangerous. "I'm going to sleep 
here." And from then on I was sleeping at the Ü
lloi út legation. And that's  where, later on Œ I 
don't know i f you know t hat story, which was January the 10th, two days after the mountains, 

when we we re up in the mountains. One night, 
it was a snowy night, a
nd one night the Arrow 
Cross came and the whole legation was taken to th
e Arrow Cross place, a departme nt of one of 
the Arrow Cross. So I knew this is the end agai
n. And I had some false id
entification with me. I 
told you, I didn't believe in them. That was fo
r the Red Cross, and it had red canvas binding. 
Very nice papers they were, st
ating that I worked for the Re
d Cross. And on the way to the 
Arrow Cross house, I ate it. It tasted very badly, but
 I ate it little by little
. And I didn't want them 
to find it on me . And there 
were too ma ny peopl e.

03:12:00 
 

Everybody from the whole legation was taken out. 
So a lot of people. Don't ask me  how ma ny, 
because Œ we ll over a hundred. So when we got to one building where they wanted to put us in 

the cellar, I heard the Arrow Cross yelling at each
 other, "Put them on top of each othe r. They'r e 
going to die anyway." And then they didn't put th
em because there wasn't  place for us, so they 
took it to their house and started to Œ They liked
 my boots. Right away I found customer. They 
said, "This is mi ne." And we were standing next 
to the wall, hands up, and 
there was an old little 
guy there who was always very Œ he was a very 
nice person, but he always asked questions. And 
as we were standing next to the wall ready to
 go to the Danube for, you know, he is asking me , 
"Mr. Veres, do you know which way is the Danube?" 
So I think I didn't lose my sense of humor. 
I told him, "Once the shooting st
arts, you know we'll be there." A
nd the next mo me nt a truckload 
of Hungarian policemen came with Wallenberg 
heading. Wh at happened that the Arrow Cross 
did not note is on the other floor there was a 
phone connection. The whole room was phones, the 
woma n who was doing the phones, who was the daught
er of the head of the departme nt, phoned 
Wallenberg and reached him. And he collected 
a truckload of Hungarian policemen, and they 
came with their truck. And they came in and he said that, "These are my people. You cannot 

touch them," and took everybody out.  

 

Q:  Did Wa llenberg sense that a point would come when he couldn't get away with these 

dema nds Œ  

 

A:  Yes.  

 

Q:  Œ anymore?   

 
A:  Yes, after that. He had to hide hims elf, and 
he was hiding in one of the big bank's bank-vault, 
which was just a block away from where Œ I kn
ew it from this woma n. This building was one 
block where my parents' home  wa
s, and he was hiding in the bank-vault. Only with a password 
you could go in. And that was the last time I met him,  
 

03:15:00 

 

when I got the phone from the super from the 
house that the Arrow Cross took away the whole 
cellar, Christians and Jews, 
everybody, where they lived, because they discovered a big, huge 
food supply from the confectionery, and they wanted
 the food take away. No
w, the owner of that 
whole building and the confectione
ry, which wasn't  just a little
 confection Œ now it's called the 
same name Œ was Swiss, originally Swiss owned. 
And one of the fa milies star ted to yell to the 
Arrow Cross, "You can't  take this away. This is 
Swiss owned." And the Arrow Cross, as much as 
they knew, "Swiss?  That has to be Jews." 
And they were not Jews. And they took everybody 
from the cellar, Jew and not Jew alike, and em
ptied out the whole building. It was full of 
chocolate and sugar and you name  it, sardines, an
d they took it. And they took everybody to that 
departme nt of the Arrow Cross. And the people 
who they let out who were friends from the 
building told me that they were Œ last time they
 saw them, they were al
so hands up next to the 
wall, and they took them down to the Danube the 
next night to kill them
. And the interesting 
part, besides that is, is that 
Œ I don't know if you know that st
atue Œ the original statue of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0238  
17 
 
Wallenberg which is standing Œ wa
s standing in the little square 
where the International Ghetto 
was, and I don't know if you know the story. Th
e Russians stole the statue. In any case, 
interesting part, if you want, I'll 
tell you, that little park where th
at statue Œ and I have that 
picture Œ which used to stand 
about ma ybe a hundred yards from 
them, that was the Danube and 
that's  where they killed my parents, 200 yards fro
m his statue which was raised later. Now, the 
story of the statue
, shall I tell you?  
 
Q:  I'd like to ask you some thi
ng else about the photographs.  
 

A:  Ask me  a question.  

 

Q:  The photographs that you have which we'r e using Œ  

 

A:  They'r e just mi nor.  

 

Q:  Œ those people pulled out Œ 
pulled out from de portation Œ  

 

A:  Yes.  

 

Q:  Œ could you describe some thing about that sc
ene and what those people Œ what the effect on 
them was of the sudden change of fate.  

 

A:  It was not to believe it, almost, you know, 
this could happen. And then those pictures, 
Wallenberg was in another car, a
nd I took pictures while the car 
was following them, went to the 
left and to the right, you know.  

 
03:18:08  
 

I took some  pictures there, some  of, and they t
hought of me  that Wa llenberg is here. But they 

never called him Raoul, and anybody w
ould tell you that they knew hi
m that well. Now, if that 
was out of respect or Œ but he was not calle
d Raoul. Nobody that I knew called him Ra oul. So 
they said, "Wallenberg is here. Wa llenberg is he
re." And that gave them some  courage. And I 
took pictures. I wasn't  Wallenberg, but I was s
ticking out from the car, and while the car was 

going slow, I took some  pictures. Yes, that feelin
g was a relief. But it is hard to explain. That 
friend of mi ne who called me , 
"Tom, Tom," you know Œ excuse me Œ I took him to one of the 
buildings, safe buildings, and he didn't, naturall
y, have papers because I told you that I took him 
out without papers. And I told hi m, "Look, this is
 where I have the little place Œ studio where I 
took the passport pictures.ﬂ I said, "I'm going to 
take your pictures now, and stay here. You have 
food, you can sleep here, and I'll be back when Iarrange for you with th
e ready papers." Two 
days later his mother, who I know from schoolin
g, come s to the legation that, "Tommy, please 
help now. They took him away." "What do you mean?  
I told him he was safe there." "Yes, but he 
went down because hi s fiancée was living two bl
ocks from there and they caught him on the 

street." I said, "I'm sorry, I Œ IŒ
 this way I cannot Œ" And he ne
ver returned. He was taken care. 
So he was saved there, and then died there. You never know.

Q:  And that group of people who were pulled out
 of the actual scene of
 deportation, they were 
taken to the Swedish houses for protection?
 Is that Œ They were housed, then Œ  
 
A:  First, I'm trying to explain 
it to you that issue. I 
told you the legality was important. So first 
they had to supply them with papers, the ones who didn't have paper. The ones who had the 

paper were taken to the inte
rnational houses, Swedish houses. The ones who didn't have the 

papers, they were not put in there. Not to enda
nger the others, they we
re in other houses owned 
by the legation waiting to have their passports ready. 
In order to have the passports, first I had to 
take passport pictures of them.  

 

03:21:00  

 

And then it went on a procedure; three, four days.  

 

[Technical conversation] 

 

Q:  Okay. Tom, could you tell me  s o me thing about
 what use Wa llenberg ma de of these pictures 

even while you were all still working?   

 

A:  No, except that he sent them out. There was no use there to use them.  

 

Q:  I thought I'd read some where 
that they Œ a few pictures were
 taken and put in front of the 
Hungarian Nazi Œ  

 

A:  Yes. You read in a book. I don't know; I wasn't  there. So I can tell you only, in all honesty, 

what I have seen. The use Œ well, I also did Œ 
actually, they were not 
the pi ctur es. I had, for 
instance, Xeroxed Œ now I'm using Xerox, my 
God Œ photocopied, all the Schutzpässe and he 
had them in a book. You had to read them too. 
So that was an imme diate use besides my 
passport pictures. And then it was Œ my parents ha
d been taken away January 12th. It had to be 
January the 10th Œ no. It was Œ in 
any case, I think it wa
s the 10th when I was with him, and he 
was speaking Œ I wasn't  in the room, but I 
was waiting outside with the head of the SS
11
 troops 
who had been surrounding Œ the defense of the 
surrounding of Budapest who were, I don't know 
OberŒ Obersturmbannführer
12
 [inaudible], whatever. His name  
I don't reme mber, but they exist. 
And he gave a paper to Wallenberg after a 
long conversation approving with Wa llenberg's 
conviction that what he should 
do. He gave a paper that the 
head of the surrounding SS troops, 
"Obersturmbannführer," whatever, "is guaranteei
ng the ghetto" because it was ready to blowup, 
and in the personal life of every Jew in Budapest
. And when he came out, he told me  that, "Tom, 
I need copies on these, as ma ny as you can do." 
I said, "There is no Œ" 
at that time everybody is 
living already in the cellar. He 
said, "Do the best you can." And 
he drove me  to my pa rents' 
home . And everybody was in the cellar, but I told 
you two days later, they
 Œ and in one little 
closed Œ enclosed place, I took developer down a
nd the necessary chemicals, and all ni ght Œ I 
don't know how much you know about
 photography with the old-fash
ioned way that you put it in 
between two glasses, but there was no electric
ity. I used candlelight, 
and doing it under the 
candle I ma de about a hundred prints of that pa
per, which Œ And he came for me  the next day,

and that was the last time I saw my parents, and 
I gave them one of these papers, but didn't help 
any. And that was a very Œ that was the last 
time . But that was one of a kind, you know, that 
under Œ no electricity. But he didn't say to me , "How did you do that?" He didn't even ask. For 
everything, this gives Œ his mi nd was set at the 
end to say it. But "how
" and "when" and "why" 
and "how did you," that doesn't  interest him.  

 

Q:  Had you ever seen him scared?   

 

A:  No. Aga i n, I don't know if that was braveness or
 naivete. No, I haven't. I told you stories of 
him which Œ no, definitely no. And even if he wa
s, I didn't see him showi ng it. Next question.  
 

Q:  I take it he kept very calm a
nd cool through most circumstances.  
 

A:  Always, always. Not one time have I seen him excited or Œ you know, that Œ showed Œ 

showing any kind of emotion like this. Joking, ye
s, which I told you when we have been going 
up to the mountain, but not Œ He was a calm, cool ma n.  

 

Q:  Just for the record, would you tell
 me what became of your parent s.  
 

A:  Pardon?   

 

Q:  Would you just tell us for the r
ecord what became of your parents.  
 

A:  I told you. I told you that they were 
killed at the Danube. I to
ld you before; reme mber? 
 

03:27:00  
 
Q:  Right at that time; right.  

 

A:  Hmm?   

 

Q:  Very close to the time that th
ey were taken fr om your house.  

 

A:  Yeah. That night. I didn't know at that time. 
It took me  about a half a year to know it and to 
sink in. They were shot in the Danube. It's  Œ  

 

Q:  And your brother.  

 

A:  My brother was here in the States. He was he
re since 1939. He's  not alive, he died of cancer 
but Œ in 1974. And even he, when I told him stories, he did not realize 
the full weight of the 
history of it. And when I came here, I, I wanted 
to come  here for a long time , and I sent papers, 
my uncle who lived here in Los Angeles since th
e mi d-thirties, and I gave him the original book 
on Wa llenberg which I have to write, and I gave
 him papers; among the m, one which stated that 
I am the offi cial photographer of the Swed
ish legation. And nobody knew about Wa llenberg in 
1956. And when I started to try to tell stories, you know, either they didn't  understand or they 

didn't believe  it. They thought I'm making it up. 
If they believe d it, it sounded too strong, until I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0238  
20 
 
me ntioned it much earlier that Œ in 1980 or 
'81, I have me t one Sunday morning in the Sunday 
Time s ma ga zine my pictures and his story. 
And it was an up and down. For a while it was 
interesting, and then it again became a non-perso
n, and then again some thing happened. I believe 
that in 19Œ I think it was '56 that
 I read about him, that Gromyko,
13
 the Russian foreign mi nister, 
admitted that he died in Russian prison, whic
h nobody believed, but it was in '47. That was the 
first time  that they have spoken about him. I to
ld you the last time I saw him in that vault.

Q:  Okay. When you're ready, would you describe
 the last time  you sa
w Wallenbergand what 
happened after that. 

 

03:29:52  

 

04:01:23 

 

[Technical conversation] 

 

A:  What happened afterward?  Okay. When I got
 the phone call from the super in the building 

where my parents were, I was trying to get 
through. Knowing Wallenberg's  hiding place, I 
wanted to speak to him. But the fighting was 
so strong, I couldn't get through. I mean, really. 
You can ima gine that I wa s trying. It was impossi
ble. Took me two days to get through. And I 
know the password. And as I have me ntioned it,
 the bank-vault was a block away from the 
Gerbeaud house. They had been taken away. So I 
went to the bank-vault, 
said the password, and 
then he was comi ng out. And I told him what 
happened. He said, "Tom, you know it's too late 
now. I can't  do anything." So a few other people 
came out. There were just a few people in the 
bank-vault. And we went to the big Œ it was li
ke a Œ it's a bank, you know, with all the windows 
there. And we were standing there in a round circ
le with the people who came out who were with 
him. They were important people for 
the legation. And his chauffeur, Vili
14
. And we were 
standing in a circle, and the figh
ting outside is going on, and he st
arted saying that, "I'm going to 
Debrecen to pick up the, the new Hungarian Œ w
ith new Hungarian government to plan for the 
future." 

 

04:03:15 

 

I don't know if you know it. There was a big plan of
 his. He wanted to Œ the plan was almost 
ready. After the war, relief, and help to people. 
And it wasn't  only for Jews. It was for the whole 
country. It was called the ﬁNansen 
Plan.ﬂ And as we were standing 
there Œ And he also asked me  
if I want to come  with him, and I said, "I 
can't , you know. I'm looking Œ" I didn't know what 
happened to my parents, because I told you it took 
me  a half a year. And so I said, "No, I can't. 
I'm looking for my parents, to help." And as we 
were standing in that circle, one of them was 

about that size [gesturing], he went flat on hi
s stomach and down on the floor. As it turned out, 
from a stray bullet, he was shot in
 the heart, just  as we were st a
nding there. And that was the last 
time I have seen him, which was Œ it had to be either 14 or 15 of January. Now, about the statue, 

which you didn't ask me , and you said you don'
t know. Do you know about the statue?   
 

[Technical conversation] 

 

Many years after, they raised money to raise 
a statue for him. And 
I know the artist and the 
people who were involved, and they asked me  to take
 the little Œ it's called 
ma quette of the statue 
                     
14

and I was working. On the pedestal of the statue wa
s his profile, and the last
 eight or te
n pictures, 
I was working with the artist, was done afte
r Œ in the photography, what I did on him. That 
remi nd me ; I never saw those pictures again. So
 I worked for a while with the artist; you know, 
in telling, showing pictures, this 
and that. And that was Œ the stat
ue itself was a big snake with a 
ma n killing the snake.  
 

04:06:12  

 

And on the side on the pedestal was his name  
and saying thanks for him from the Hungarian 
people. And they called me  that Œ I don't know wh
at day. Maybe it was a Fr
iday, that the statue 
is up; "We just finished it," in that park I ha
ve told you, "and take some  pictures before the 
official unveiling on Sunday." And that never came b
ecause the statue disappeared in the thin air. 
Now you ha ve to live those times; that was 
already the Russians, the Communists, the 
everybody. Why?  Everybody knew that they didn't  
like him. So obviously it was stolen by the 

Russians. Now, you don't Œ that was a big statue from
 here to there [gesturi
ng]. A year later, I go 
to one of the exhibitions, art exhibitions, in Buda
pest, and the statue is 
there without his profile 
and without the inscription, and th
e statue's  name  was "Fight Ag
ainst Fascism." Years later, I 
was already here, and I was reading Œ some body se
nt me a Hungarian magazine, and I see the 
statue there. Said that Œ what was 
his name ?  The Indonesian head Œ Sukarno
15
. Sukarno was in 
Budapest and fell in love with a pictur e which 
Œ which title is "The Sn
ake Killer," and he bought 
it for his garden ma ny moons later. And obviously, supposedly, right now it's standing Œ they 

must have different versions. Cannot be the same . Bu
t the same  statue is one of the Œ in front of 
the pharmaceutical company Œ you're shaking your Œ you heard it? No. Okay–pharmaceutical 

companies in Hungary; standing there. I don't know if
 it has a title or not, but
 I had the Œ I read it 
also, and I know it's true. So that's the story of 
one of his Œ And then th
ey raised statues today, 
which has nothing to do with that one, and doesn
't  re me mber Wallenberg to me  at all, so....  
 

Q:  I wanted to go back to in the times that you we re with Wa llenberg and you were 

photographing him when he wasŒ 

 

04:09:05  

 

A:  Yes.  

 

Q:  –confronting the deportation attempts, what's 
the most surprising thing that he did?  What 
surprised you or astonished 
you the most in his actions?  
 

A:  Nothing astonished me ; nothing. Because I don't know how to explain it to you, but the 

whole thing was like a smooth operation. It, it
, it was natural. You 
didn't question why it 
happened; what is it. No. I don't know if it give
s you an explanation or not, but there were no 
surprises. Your whole concentration was to he
lp to people. But that was not surprising. 
Surprising was the day by day happenings that they
 called you from here or for there. They 
taking people here and come  out
 from the big factory or Œ th
at was surprising. It wasn't  
surprising. It was a thing that you worked on it, 
but not surprised. I canno
t tell you one incident 
which I would call that surprising. Sorry.

 Achmed Sukarno
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0238  
23 
 
 
Q:  And yet what he did was so unique.  

 

A:  Yes. That's  surprising. That's  the surprisi ng. Unique and still taking it as nothing happened.  

 

Q:  Do you think anyone else co
uld have done similar things?   

 

A:  We ll, you're asking me  that. I don't know. It took a special ma n to do it. But how ma ny 

special men are comi ng up when the time comes a
nd stand up. Well, mayb
e there are lots of 
them, but they are not there when it's needed. Is it 
surprising that it's not surprising?  It is the most 
natural, I cannot give you any ot
her description than it was just 
so natural, so 
smooth. And it was 
a great deal Œ deed, I mean.  

 

Q:  Can you give us the picture of any other in
teractions he had, you know
, before that end of 
Nove mber railway station?  Any other scenes 
of that kind you could describe for us?   
 

A:  We ll, I gave you the Œ that house when ev
erybody was taken. I can ŒFor instance, when I 
told you the head of the SS group, they were 
going on the street. Nobody was on the street.  
 

04:12:05  

 

Nobody asked, "How come  we are al
l alone on the street." I'm trying to visualize it. And it was 
he Œ you wouldn't know because you have to go deeper. Somebody who had the connection 

between the Budapest and Œ that we had people bu
ilt in, who were working for us but they were 
outside, either Nazis or Œ and, 
and his chauffeur, that's  when we were–. No, I'm sorry. That 
happened when we were stepping out from thecar and going to ma ke the copy, copy negatives. 
You know, when I told you–. Something wrong?   
 

Q:  We 'r e getting a high-pitche
d tone some where. Sorry.  
 

A:  Okay?  Where were we?  We  were on the stre
et, stepping out. And I'm 
just trying to give you 
that nobody dared to go out on the st
reet, and there we were, walki
ng on the street. Now, this is 
nothing because you walk on the street every day, 
but that was some  kind of special event, you 
know. And came three; two of th
em Arrow Cross uniform, a nd then other one, a streetcar 
conductor with his streetcar uniform, and Œ but with the Nazi armband. So they came  ahead, and 

we just went by. And after that, we were just 
talking. ﬁThey could have stopped us. They could 
have stopped us.ﬂ Now, this is true. That ha
ppened quite late, before the Russians came  in. 
Maybe two weeks later, I was passi
ng by Œ as a ma tter of fac t , Genya
16
 showed me  a picture. The 
Communist party's headquarter, 
I passed by, and they had arme d guards in the doorway, guns, 
and the Russians were already 
in two weeks later. What do you think?  Wh o was the guy standing 
in the Œ with the Communist, red armband?

The streetcar conductor I 
saw two weeks before with the Arrow Cross band. That's  Œ I know it's 
not easy to believe, but I reme mbered his face. I'
m very good with faces; very bad with name s. I 
didn't ask his name .  
 

Q:  Did you understand the power 
your photographs could have?   
 

A:  You know what?  I think I did. As a ma tter 
of fact, not only photographs. I did mo vies. I 
mean, today, home movie. I had a little Koda
k. At that time it was a big thing, but eight 
millimeter movie. Now, many of the films never reached anywhere because, as I mentioned to 

you, in the last days he was hidi
ng, so I had mo vies, and I was al
l the time with a Œ I don't know 
why, but Œ and he was going, too, all the time . In German it's rucksack, when you go to Œ back 

knapŒ backpack. I had all my things in there. 
Backpack; cameras, undevel
oped films. And when 
the biggest fight was going on where the legation was,
 we were in the cellar, certain pa rt, a few 

of us, and suddenly a Russian come s in. Here 
we are. The Russians occupied us. He was 
standing at the top of the stairway. He said Œ don'
t tell me  how we understood it, but he said, "I'm 
going to stand here to stand guard." Let's say this 
is over there. Half an hour later, on the other 

side the wall opens and the German head 
come s in and says, "Anybody here? "  you know. And 
we told him, "Hey, get out of here. The Russian's are over there." No, he is going to collect the 

Germans, and he did. So we knew there will be
 a big fight going on ther
e. And we broke through 
the wall which has a certain spot in it just for 
this purpose, and went, which was connected with 

other big cellar where at least a hundredpeople, wo me n and children were. Good enough. 

Fifteen mi nutes later, the German come s in 
with machine gun, and that was deliberate up high, 
you know. We had to go Œ And on the other side, 
the Russian. And they started to shoot each 
other above our head. And in the short period it
 was so full of gunpowder, smoke; children cried, 
and wome n. So we said, "Let's try, 
and try to get out from here."  
 
04:18:05  
 

And slowly we broke out the next wall, and tr
ying the children and wome n. And my knapsack 
was in my way, and I gave it to somebody, frien
d, and I said, "Look. I'm helping the wome n and 
children. You come  after us anyway." And we Œ 
took us a day to go about ten houses from cellar 
to cellar to cellar. Two hours la
ter, this friend of mi ne s
howe d up. I said, "Where 's my 
knapsack? "  He said, "The Russians took it." There 
went my films, my cameras, everything. What 

was not developed, what was not given 
to him yet; everything. Ask question.  
 

Q:  Was it known really directly there in Buda
pest what was happening in Auschwitz with the 
Hungarian Jews?   

 

A:  You me an at that time?   

 

Q:  The intense rate of killing that was taking place.  

 

A:  Wa it. Are you speaking afte
r the war or during the Œ  
 

Q:  In '44, during that time.  

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0238  
25 
 
A:  Not really. You heard the stor ies, but it wasn
't accepted or Œ or Œ or proven as a known fact. 
They was speaking about.  
 

Q:  Did Wa llenberg know, clearly?   

 

A:  I don't know. I really don't know. I never spoke 
about things Œ what happened after. But for 
instance, when I was in Miskolc, that was be
fore Wa llenberg, which I told you, in labor camp. 
As you know, the countryside was almost clean from Jews by the time  he came, whi c h was in 

July. And half of the outfit was from Miskolc, an
d the parents Œ parents we re in the ghetto, and 
we help them to pack and Œ you know, because 
they were de ported. And the trains were going 
next where we had our outfit. And one morning next
 to the train there were
 handwritten signs to 
the boys, some  of the boys, "Goodbye.  

 

04:21:08  

 

I don't know if I'll see you." And we were pick
ing up and giving whoever it belonged to. And a 
few weeks later, postcards were coming for the 
boys, and it said Œ I don't know if you ever heard 
the name  Waldsee. That was the code name  of
 Auschwitz, and saying it
 was Œ as the location. 
Do you speak any German?  It sounds like a re
sort area, you know?  Wa ldsee. And they 
stereotype. They said, "We are feeling good, we
 are working; we are feeling good, we are 
working; we are working, we are feeling good. Ev
erything is fine." And that was Auschwitz. But 
we didn't know it. And they were boys who thought, "Oh, that's  all right," you know. They are 

working. And the name  was Œ you never heard?  Wald
see, but there was no talk about Auschwitz. 

Waldsee was Auschwitz. If he knew it, I don't 
know. I don't Œ ma ybe. I don't know. I 'm trying to 
give you only what I know without any question.  

 
Q:  Are there any other people who worked direc
tly with you with Wa llenbe
rg that stand out in 
your mi nd?   
 

A:  We ll, there were the Œ who was with him in
 the vault. Hugo Wohl w
ho was the head of the 
electrical factory, and Forgács
17
 who was his Œ they were all connected with that factory, and 
their sons. I was in good. And then there are peop
le whose name I don't  
mention because I know 
they have nothing to do with it in their life. It
 turned out that they don't want to be heard. I 
wanted to say some thing. I interrupted myself
, but I don't know what it was. Yeah; that Œ 
Re me mber when I told you when I was introduced to
 him, he said that "Y
ou will report direct to 
me ." And for good reasons I kept my distance, an
d with his thoughts also, 
that I did not mi ngle 
too much. Fi rst of all, you didn't know Œ what 
I was doing was undercover even there, because 
you didn't know who is squealing on who and what 
Œ you know, to be caught. So I had to be very 
careful telling people th
is I'm taking pictures.

So I had a special place there. 
I was in connection with ma ny people, but ma ny of them didn't 
even know that I exist. And as I told you, I ju
st Œ I know not many, mayb
e two or three name s, 
which I can't  me ntion because I know that 
they wouldn't wa nt. Why, don't ask me .

Q:  Did Wa llenberg 
change your life?   
 

A:  First of all, he was life. Not intentionally 
or unintentionally, but I w
ouldn't  be here. Maybe I 
would with some other Œ I don't know Œ In my whole 
life, it's not a daily routine, but he left a big 
ma rk on my way of thinking even if I don't think 
about him directly. So when I had a chance, I 
was trying to help. Not in those 
circumstances, but I had my other later on with the Co mmunist 
governme nt and so forth, which I was against. So 
he left Œ he left a deep mark on my mind and 
in my heart, in a good way. Some times I was just suppressing, you know, because for a while, 

when Œ when nobody was listening, I was trying to te
ll a story and was trying to tell people about 
him and they didn't listen, so I buried it. And it's Œ 
I call it lately, ma ybe in the last few years. 
And then I sa w ma ny that I Œ I'm still not activ
e because even today, I don't see too ma ny things 
right about what people are doi
ng. Many are just there; not ju
st there, but ma king money.  
 

Q:  What would you like younger people who are not
 familiar with hi s actions, what would you 
want them to know about what he did, 
what he was, what he is for you?  

 

04:27:06  

 

A:  For me or for them?   

 

Q:  In the sense of what he did, what that 
represents, how that changed you for the good. How 
would you communicate that
 to younger people?   
 

A:  It's easy to live when there is no trouble in
 your life, and you will find only few people who 
will stand up, and you never know where the trouble co
mes; from the right or to the left. And try 
to be a me nsch, which he was. That's it, a me nsch, which he was. Because you don't find this 

type every day, and you ma y not recognize it when there is no trouble. But you do know who it 

is by the action when it's there. And very fe
w people stand up when it's needed. And you think 
they are good friends, and they don't stand up 
for you. And do not wait for the time  when the 
trouble is comi ng. Try to preven
t the trouble. Because no matter 
where it happens in the world, 
should it be Hungary, Germany, th
e United States, the gutter people are there, no ma tter what 
and where they were born. And the same  ba
d idea could be anywhere. Should it be called 
ﬁCommunist,ﬂ should it be called 
ﬁNazi,ﬂ they come  out from the 
gutter. They float out when the 
people ar e not ther e to pr event it.
 That's  it. I hope it says it.
