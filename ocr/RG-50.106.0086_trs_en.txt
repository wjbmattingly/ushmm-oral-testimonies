November 22, 1997
 
 
Question: This interview is being taped on
 behalf of the United States Holocaust 
Memorial Museum. The interview is w
ith Marion Friedman. And my  name, the 
interviewer, is Nancy Alper. An d today's date 
is November 22nd, 1997
. This is the first 
tape, Side A. Marion, wo
uld you please tell me your name at
 birth, your date of birth an d 
your place of birth? 
 
Answer: Ok ay. My  name of birth isthe whol
e name is Tiaute Marion Julia Georgia 
Solo mo s (phonetic) And I was born December the 10th, 1922.
 
Q: Where were you born? 
 
A: In Hamburg, Germany.
 
Q: Can you spell those first names for me, please?
 
A: Tiaute is Tiaute. Marion is Marion. Julia, 
Juliann. No. I'm sorry. I 
missed it, ia on the 
end, Julia. And Georgia is like regular 
Georgia like American Georgia, forget it.
 
Q: And your last name as well.
 
A: My last name in German is Sulomos. 
My dad was Hungarian an d they pronounced  it 
in Hu ngary, Smorish (ph).
 
Q: Why don't you tell me your current address 
and telephone number so we'll have that 
on th e tape as well?
 
Q: And that's in Greensboro, North Carolina,
 correct? Okay. I think I'll start by asking 
you wh ether you've ever been interviewed 
before, and if so where and under wh at 
 
circumstances, and how long ago it was?
 
A: No. I have never been interviewed at any time anywhere. 
 
Q: Why are you willing to do it now?
 
A: Well, I think one of my  sons put my  na
me into the Holocaust Museum. And I think 
my children are anxious for me to do it. An
d I'm really doing it to
 help the people to 
reme mb er. I know we'v e got plenty  of things to
 rememb er here, but I really want to do it 
now. And I have never done mu ch talk about it, 
so I feel like this is 
the time really to do 
it.
 

Q: I also thought we could start by your si
mply telling me about 
your parents, their 
background, their education, and their families
, their religious life, anything that you can 
think of, their personalitie
s to talk about them. 
 
A: I guess every child says their parents were
 wonderful. I had very  wonderful parents. 
My father wasokay I think we left at my fath
er. My father went to 
high school, I'm sure. 
And he might have gone to college too, bu
t I really don't know. But he was a Latin 
scholar and helped ev erybody in  the neighbor
hood, kindness of his heart, and he was a 
wonderful man. And my  mo ther had high sc
hool. And I really don't know ab out college 
either. She was life smart. She was a very smar
t, bright lady. Sh e played the piano. Sh e 
played the violin. She sewed.
 She played ex cellent bridge. She just knew how to  do 
everything.
 
Q: Do you know the birth dates? I want to as
k you the full names of your parents, but do 
you know th eir birth dates?
 
A: I really don't remember. I'm embarrasse
d  to admit it, but 
I don 't remember.  
 
Q: Why don't you tell me their full na
mes and wh ere they were both born? 
 
A: My dad was born in Hungary  in a small 
town called Cameron. And my  mo ther was 
born in Lubeck, Germany, a beau tiful
 town, which I visited many times.
 
Q: What was their background 
in terms of the kinds of fa
milies that they
 came from? 
 
A: I really don't know too mu ch  about my  da
d's family. I did knoww hich  my  brother told 
me that he wasthere was something wrong, 
something that ignited. I really don't 
reme mb er t h e wh o l e thin g ,  bu t my mo th er 
was from a very plain,
 hardworking family, 
and I never knew my  grandparents. I really on
ly knew her brothers 
and they wereall had 
interesting professions. They  all did 
okay. And that's all I really know. 
 
Q: You never knew th e family memb ers of 
your father's  Hungarian family; is that 
correct?
 
A: I knew some of my father's  brothers, but on
ly when I was very yo
ung. Used to visit in 
Hungary. And I just knew them as Uncle Chan
 (ph) or my father
one of my father's 
brothers was a lawyer, Uncle Ch an dor (ph). An
d he had a couple of 
other brothers who I 
really did not know. And my  mo th er had tw o brothers, whom I kn
ew who visited us 
frequently .
 
Q: Why don't you tell me first how your 
father ended up coming from Hungary to 
Germany, and th en ho
w your parents met?
 
A: This is quite unusual because my dad alwa
ys wanted  to come to
 the United States.  
And his father was, I guess, maybe tired of 
hearing it. And he decided to give him a 

certain amount of mo ney, I don't know how 
mu ch, but I heard the story many times. And 
he had to go to Hamburg to get the ship because Hamb urg and one other port, Bremen, I 
think were the largest hard 
ports in Europe at the time. And he came to Hamburg 
purposely a few days ahead of time because 
wehis parents had some friends there whom 
he was supposed  to visit. And 
at one of the visits, they had 
a tea in the afternoon, tea and 
coffee and cakes. And he met my
 mother. And he took one lo
ok at her and really liked 
her a lot. And it was raining outside. And my
 mother was there with her mother. And he 
happened  to  have an umbrella, and he took 
them home. And asked her mo ther if he may 
date her, and she said, oh, sure, if you woul
d like to. And this was the beginning of a 
wonderful relationship.
 
Q: What year would that ha
ve been  or you can probably 
figure out a general notion of 
what age they were, although I understand it's 
hard to be specific. 
I think you told meoh, 
no, that was your brother. Do 
you have a sense of wh en he 
might have come to Hamburg 
for the purpose of going to the United States? 
 
A: Well, my brother would have been 85 now. 
And so it's been quite a few years, and you 
don't want to take the time for me 
to figure it out right now, okay?
 
Q: Can I assume that that brother was 
born pretty soon after they got married? 
 
A: Well, it was at least more than 12 months,that's for sure. And that brother, P.S., was 
my  oldest brother, became a doctor. And I shall tell you about that later. All right.
 
Q: I'm interested in the fact, and you told me
 this in the preinterview that your mother 
was not Jewish. And I'm wonderi
ng what your sense or memo ri
es of the stories you heard 
from your parents led you to 
believe about wh at it meant for a Jew and a nonJew to get 
married in a big city in Germany at that time? 
 
A: You know, it's funny, I never really ga
ve that mu ch thought because it wasI knew 
other people where their father was Jewish or vice versa and th e mo ther was Jewish. And 

it was a mixed marriage. And they were very 
happy with each other. And there was never 
any talk about that much Judaism. And I di
dn't live in a Jewish ne
ighborhood. And it's 
really hard for me to
 answer that question because ther
e was no problem in those days. I 
mean, my  parents went everywhere. My parent
s did a lot of traveling. No body discussed 
it and nobody asked me are you Jewish? It just
 was foreign to  me, and th at's the truth.
 
Q: I just realized, Marion, I didn't get the name
s of each of your parents, so why don't you 
give their complete names and spell their fi
rst names because you've already spelled the 
last name.
 
A: My dad's name was Morris, or Maurice So
lomo s (ph)didn't  I mention that before? And 
my mother's name was Bertha or Bertie (ph)
 most of her friends 
call ed bought Haagen, 
Haagen.
 

Q: So it was not an issue is what you're sa
ying, the in termarriage was not an issue. Did 
your mo ther observe Ch ristian holidays or 
go to church , and what
 kind of Jewish 
observances did she or your fa
ther and you participate in?
 
A: No. I never remember my mother going to
 church. My dad went
 on the high holidays 
and occasionally on Friday nigh
t and would take us along. An
d I feel badly, but there are 
many things which really are not clear in my
 mind anymore. There was neverhe took me 
along for some of the high holidays. I went
 later years to Su nday  school and studied 
Hebrew fo r a year or two and went to regu
lar Sunday school, but otherwise it was never 
an issue and nobody ever made 
an issue over it until Hitler came.
 
Q: Marion, why don't you talk ab out how th e 
Christian celebrations that your family 
engaged in , kind of intermixed with the Je
wish observances and 
holidays that you did 
with your father and brothers? 
 
A: Well, the biggest holiday, Christian holiday
, in fact, the only Chri
stian holiday that I 
can remember, we made a big fest over Ch
ristmas. My mo ther always had a big 
Christmas tree up to the ceiling, and we had th
ree front rooms and all threeit w as a ladies' 
room where my mother had special ladies' fu rniture, and a man 's ro om in the middle, 
which was all leather furniture, and a dining 
room on the side. And all three rooms for 
about a week before Christmas w ere closed 
off. And she always brought in a table for 
everybody. We each had either a bridge table 
or some type of table. And they were 
packed with gifts. Bu
t nobody was allowed 
in that door, and it was such an exciting 
holid ay for me and my  brothers and my  fri
ends. And I can't even describe it. And 
everybody got a big plate, a co
lorful paper plate. And on the 
paper plates were all kinds 
of mo assapin (ph) breads and candies and all 
sorts of fun th ings. And that holid ay we 
observed to the bitter end.
 
Q: Was there any discussion or conflict about 
celebrating Christmas because your father 
was Jewish and raising you Jewish? 
 
A: No, it was not. At Hanukkah , he would light
 the candles, and sometimes my brothers 
were there, but some weren 't there but it is
n'tit wasn't very memorable to me an d it 
wasn'tno fuss was made over. I got to be honest.
 
Q: Did the Christian relatives, the relatives
 of your mo ther come and join in th e 
celebration, the Christmas celebra
tion with you and your family?
 
A: They sometimes came the day afterwards
, but Ch ristmas Eve we always had by 
ourselves. And they used to alwaysthe tr
adition was that you ate carp and parsley 
potatoes with brown butter. And my  mo ther had a 
set. This is so hard to believe. She had 
a set. She only used dishes at 
Christmastime and they were a
ll painted and it was theI still 
reme mb er it so vividly because they were all 
the botto m of the sea, a nd they were in these 

bluishgrayish colors with fish pictures unde
r the sea. And, oh, they were beautiful. And 
all that went to the Naxis, everything.
 
Q: What Jewish celebrations 
did you participate in? I thi
nk you said something to me 
about Purim when we
 talked earlier.
 
A: Oh, yes, my dad took me to Purim to temp
le. It was a good way. We used to have a 
car many years ago, but he had given up th atcar. And we used to gohad to walk and took 
a street car and went to th
e temp le which was a good dist
ance away from us. It was a 
reform temple, and everybody would march 
around. And th ey woul
d get candies and it 
was very ex citing. That was the only Jewish holiday  I reme mb er.
 
Q: Was the reform temple ve
ry far from where you lived?
 
A: Yes, very much so.
 
Q: And you lived 
in an apartment?
 
A: Yes. I lived close to the Hamburgthe main
 hospital. It wasn 't to o far away because I 
reme mb er my  brother in later years would wa
lk up tohe became a doctor. It wasit was a 
veryvery nice apartment house. There were 
only four apartments
 in there. And I 
remember every bit of the place.
 
Q: Was itwould you characterize it as 
an upper middle class neighborhood?
 
A: Definitely. I don't know if 
you would consider it now upper 
middle class, but in those 
days, it definitely was. It had big hallways you 
entered. In fact, I could even describe it to 
you. It had three nice size front rooms, which 
all closed off. They ha
d sliding doors if you 
wanted to  close them. And if you could open
 them, they were all three open, and had a 
long hallway . And we had threeandahalf bedr
ooms, actually, the half bedroom was for a 
housekeeper, and a large kitchen. And I would 
say it was a very beau tiful apartment. And 
I remember we had oriental rugs everywhere
 because my dad's brother was an oriental 
dealer and I guesseven the bathro om. And we 
had two bathrooms. An
d I think in those 
days, nobody ev er even  heard of that. And so
 I would say it was an upper middle class. 
But I really didn't know that much about
 upper middle class as a ch ild or not.
 
Q: Yes, I realize that's not a child's ques
tion. And the school, you
 mentioned that you 
went to private school. Was that near the 
house, and wh at kind of school was that?
 
A: I wentfor the first few years, I went to a regular public school. And th en 
whenduringwhen Hitler 
got in power and things got bad,
 my mother pulled me out of 
there and put me in a private school, which 
was owned by two French ladies. And I had 
to walk about 25 minutes to 
that school. But it was private. And it was veryit was a lovely 
school. And, P.S., it was bombe
d completely to the ground.
 

Q: I'm glad you said that because it reminde
d me. I wanted to ask you sinceand we will 
talk about this latersin ce you have gone back  to Germany since the war, is th at apartmen t 
building still existing that yo
u spent your childhood in?
 
A: Yes, it certainly is. In fact, I went back 
several times. And what I remember as a child 
playing on the street, you know, 
hopsco tch and all of the things that children play. And I 

had a couple of girlfriends on the street. A
ll of the little trees, which were there on each 

side have now gotten huge and th ey have 
madewhat do you call an arcade? A wedge. 
They meet in the middle and the street is 
much prettier than it was before. And the other 
thing, which is so strange, wher
e we used to walk to come to
 our home is now filled with 
cars. You can hardly walk thro
ugh the street b ecause it'sever
ywhere are cars. And in my 
days we didn't have that many cars. I mean, th
e street has really, really changed. But the 
grocery store is still on the corner. And one 
of the people when 
I went back when I 
mentioned my  name, she said, yes, she heard 
that there was a Jewish  family living there 
and she remembered her 
mother talking about it.
 
Q: Now, I would like to ask you about your si
blings, if you could tell me  their names and 

their birth dates or ages, and how mu ch ol
der they were than you, and wh at your 
relationship with them was and the family.
 
A: Okay , I have two brothers. My oldest br
other was ten years older than I am. And my  
younger brother was five years older than I 
am. And I was very close throughwell, I was 
very close to my  younger brother because 
he was close in age to me. And as I was 
growing up, he used to take me places, and I 
felt very close towell, 
my older brother had 
already drifted away. He went 
to med school and became very 
interested in Zionism, and 

became very bitter when thewhen Hitler took 
over and was very hard to talk to and 
changed his whole personality.
 
Q: You being th e youngest and 
the only daughter, what was 
your relationship with your 
parents compared to how th
ey  treated your brothers?
 
A: I was spoiled rotten.
 
Q: I'd like to ask you, Marion, ab
out your impressions of your 
father's family
 in Hu ng ary, 
which mu st have seemed very different 
from thewhat you knew in Hamburg and your 
relationship in Hamburg and the surroundi
ng area with your mo th er's relatives.
 
A: I visited Hamburg. I visited Hungary  not 
that often, and I met the family. And there 
was some second cousins I used
 to play with, but it wasn't 
of any importance or anything. 
What's very memorable to me, 
my Uncle Chandor (ph) was always very kind to me and 
took us out. And it was a very pleasant relatio
nship, but not very close because we didn't 
see each other that often. And I think that's it.
 
Q: And your mother's  family?
 

A: Well, one particular brother, this Uncle Willie
, we used to be close to. His wifeis this a 
good time? His wife used to be a govern ess 
to my  parents many years ago. And when  my  
mother's brother, Uncle Willie, ca
me to visit for the first time,
 he fell in love with this 
governess, with our governess, and married he
r. And so __+ used to 
know us well, too I 
wasn't born yet. And when I was born, they 
were married already. So  we had a pretty 
good relationship with them. 
And we used to meet and 
go intoon the outskirts of 
Hamburg were beautiful woods and you would 
go have a picnic somewhere. And we'd  do 
that occasionally and had good
 times and had goodfun. And they had two sons, and one 
of the sons was takenin the last war, the last
 war. And it was in prison in  Texas and losthe 
had lost during the war one of 
his legs and he wasI sometime
s had the feeling that he was 
really a Naxi, and it was a very uncomfortabl
e feeling to me even
 now to even think 
about that.
 
Q: Before Hitler came to power 
in Germany, could 
you describe what your daily routine 
life was lik e before the antisemantic rules? We 
were getting ready to talk about daily life, 
as Marion experienced it as 
a child in Hamburg, and various simu lated environment 
before Hitler came to power.
 
A: I think I had a very  happy childhood. My
 daily routine was lik
e everybody elses, I  
went to school in th e mo rning, and I ca
me home and I had lots
 of friends. And on 
weekends we would go to the movies and we
 had a good time. I was invited to parties, 
birthday parties. And there was never any talk
 about An tisemitism. I don't know. I'm sure 
thatI didn't realize that there 
was such a thing that even we nt on because I never felt that 
they knew I was half Jewish and half not 
Jewish, but nobody rea
lly talked about it. 
Nobody made any fuss over that. And my  lif
e was very good. We went every summer. 
We went to Travemunde, which is a summer resort. My mother took
 us and my father 
came with us, too. And we had a wonderful tim
e. In fact, many years later I visited and I 
remembered many things. And I feel like I 
was a very lucky little girl because I was 
loved by my  parents and life was wonde
rful. I didn 't know it was any different.
 
Q: And you don't rememb er pe
opleand you don't reme mber pe
ople even talking or your 
parents talking about the fact that your mo
ther wasn 't Je wish and your father was? 
 
A: No, not really until Hitler 
came, and then all of a sudd
en the whole picture changed 
and my life was just so different. And it's
 like somebody woke me up out of a good 
dream, and I justlife w as just different.
 
Q: Realizing that you can only rememb er as
 a child remembered obviously, what are 

your earliest recollections of the in
fluence of Hitler on your daily life?
 
A: I think my parents were ve
ry, very protective of me, me 
not learning too much about it 
because as soon as Hitler came
 into power, my mother pulle d me out of public school, 
and put me into this priv ate school where I had 
one Jewish girl in the class and the rest of 

them were nonJewish and ev erybody was fri
ends with everybody
. And nobody talked 
about it again, which I mentioned before.
 
Q: Do you remember how the 
environment or if the environment in your neighborhood 
began to change, sold iers, signs, anything 
that indicated that thethe bigger change?
 
A: Not on my  street, not in the neighborhood,
 but I remember my pa
rents talking aboutI 
knew that there was a crystal night when
 down town Hamburg, wh ich was a good 
distance away from where we liv
ed, they had crystal night, 
how they took all of the 
Jewish department stores and destroye
d the windows and tore things out and
 
Q: Marion, you were saying th
at your parents shielded you 
as a child from things that 
might be upsetting or whatever. But we were
 talking about what 
nevertheless you saw 
through your child's eyes of wh at was 
going on around you once the Naxis came to 
power.
 
A: Well, I was very much aw
are th at my  parents were anxious to getespecially my  
mother was very much aware th
at she felt like the boys needed to get out. And sh e had a 
friend in China who oh, gosh, I don't even 
know how to explain it exactly, wh o was her 
only way to get my  brother, Fred, out beca
use he was born in Hungary and his quota 
number wouldn't  be called for a long time ju
st like my  father's quota number. So she 
wrote this friend a letter and 
he gotmy brother, Fred, got 
a passage and could only take 
out very minimum things. He practically left
 with no money and he
 got out by sh ip and 
went to Ch in a and he ended uphe went to Shan
ghai and hated it there and went to Teresin 
and got a very good job and was fine, and tha
nk God, my  parents were grateful for that. 
And my  brother, Henry, got out even earlier so
 I was aware of those things very mu ch so. 
My brother, Henry, studied medi
cine and wasn't able to get his diploma in Germany and 
subsequently had to get out 
of the country because of H
itler. And he went, if I'm not 
mistaken, he studied his last year in Graz 
and my  Uncle Chan dor (ph) who was a lawyer 
and very well to do helped him to get out of
 Hungary. I don't reme mb er how he went. I 
don't know wherehe left from Hungary someho
w, and he went to
 the United States.
 
Q: Do you have a recollection 
of their leaving both the time 
in relation to when you left 
and what the household was like when  they  
left and then what it was like afterwards?
 
A: Well, my brother, Henry, le
ft first actually, and it was 
a blessing because we all knew 
that the Nazis were after the young men. And 
my  mo ther was very mu ch relieved that he 
left. And then my  brother, Fred, left just about
 a yearandahalf or so before I left. And it 
was an empty feeling, but they  were relieve
d, and they  were happy. And I knew that 
things were getting worse and worse. So my  
feeling was the same way, but I cried wh en 
he left and we were very sad when they were
 both leaving, but it is always for the best.
 

Q: Both  brothers understood th at they should
 leave. I mean, there was no argument in the 
family about wh ether or not wh ether they should leave?
 
A: No, not at all. In fact, th
ey were dying to get out. Thi
ngs around didn't  look so good 
and the newspaper sounded terri
ble and th e Jews just hadespecially the men had to get 
out, but my father was very mu
ch  against getting me out beca
use he kept thinkinghe was 
a German officer in the Austrian armynot 
a German officer, actually Hungarian army . 
And years ago he felt that they weren 't really
 going to  touch us, and my  mo ther evidently 
knew better and saw to it that th
e boys got out, but I really go
t out just on the very bitter 
end. And I felt like I didn't want to go eithe
r, but what child at 14 
or 15 wants to leave 
their parents? So I was also sent away.
 
Q: And even  though your father didn't feel as
 strongly about it as your mo ther did, he was 
willing to go along with
 your mother and work to get the 
three of you out of the country?
 
A: Oh, yes, once he really r
ealized how bad th ings were ge
tting, he was relieved that we 
were able to get out. And I was the baby in
 the family. And I was his little daughter, and 
he used to  call me pipian meaning doll and it 
was very hard for him.
 I think he took it 
almost harder than my
 mother to see me go.
 
Q: I wanted to ask you, Mari
on, about your father's busin
ess and how it was affected by 
the rise of the Naxis in Germany.
 
A: Right after my parents got married, the m
oney he had for the passa
ge to go to Europe 
tonot from Europe to America, he had that
 money. And I don't 
know how he managed, 
but he opened up a bank in 
the main railway station in Ha
mburg. It was an exchange 
bank for the foreigners who cameall of the fore
ignersin those days we didn't have planes 
so they consequently came by 
train and they  would co me in there and ex chan ge their 
currency. And also a lot of people came from abroad or from other parts of Europe and 
would put a deposit, and then
 they also had little saving acco
unts. And through the years, 
in fact, I rememberI have wonderful memo
ries, my fath er taking me sometimes on 
Saturdays. He only stayed a half day, he 
would take me along. And th ere was a candy 
store next store, and the lady knew  me by then
 and I would always have a real good time 
eating all kinds of chocolate 
and having fun. But then 
when Hitler came, the way I 
understood it, is that they just came in 
and says you can't be in the front window 
anymore, you can't be here a
nymore and this is it and we're taking over. And they gave 
him like equivalent to a dollar 
or whatever it was. It was ju
st very little bit. And I don 't 
even know if they gave him a
nything to  be perfectly honest. A
nd that was the end of it.  I 
remember the only time I have ev
er seen my father cry except 
for when I left is when he 
came home and told my mother that the Gestapo came and took it over and that was it.
 
Q: Was he able to work anywhere after that time?
 

A: No, never worked anymore,
 just stayed home. Was depressed a lot, for a good wh ile. 
But he got over it and then he 
kept himself busy with  other 
things. He tutored around, but 
he didn't makehe didn't ask for any money fo
r that. We were fairly comfortable. And my 
mother soldwhat th
ey call in Germany a coeur, which is
 one of the paintings, pictures I 
brought in, you can see it. It
 was a diamond neck
lace and they sold that. And life became 
quite different from what it was before.
 
Q: And at that time both of you
r brothers were already gone? 
 
A: Yes, they were.
 
Q: Why don't you tell me a little bit more about
 your relationship w
ith your mother, and 
what you rememb er doing with her befo
re you left for the United States?
 
A: My mother was a very courageous lady. 
Sh e wasI don't know if I mentioned, she was 
very talented, did I mention on the tape that
 she played  piano and she played  the violin ? 
And she hadafter Hitler tookaf
ter they took my father's 
bank, she opened up a bridge 
club. In the early days she did bridge fo
r pleasure, but then 
she opened up right 
downtown in Hamburg. It was called the Eiks
ter House. It was right on the Eikster, which 
is the body of water in the center of downto
wn . And she opened up 
down stairs a bridge 
club and people would have to
 call, and she would charge a certain amount, and she 
would arrange bridge games 
for them. And I guess that br
oughtthat brou
ght in a little 
income. Before that when I 
was little, before she started wo
rking she was always a very 
up person. She was happy and fun 
to be with. And I was just 
telling somebody in all of 
the years, my early years, I have never re
memb ered  my  mo th er ev er co mp lain in g  ab ou t 
her health. I mean she was always just well 
and veryI think sh e was very smart. She was 
the one who saw that we all got out and sh e 
was just a super lady. She could sew. She 
could do anything.
 
Q: Do you remember, Marion, yo
ur mo ther or your father or both of them sitting down  
with you and/or your brothe
rs and talking in  a basic wa
y about the situation and the 
decision they had made to get the 
three of you out of the country?
 
A: No, I don't rememb er any of that. I don't 
think they  evermaybe they sit down  with 
Henry, but I thinkno, I don'
t remember that. I don't.
 
Q: Tell me a little bit about what
 you remember about when y
our mother took you out of 
school and begin having you tutored in 
English and kindergarte
n teaching training?
 
A: Well, inasmuch as I was very young, and I believe very immature, she wanted to be 
sure that I had some little knowledge of
 something. So I 
tookin Germany the 
kindergarten , the first person who invented  ki
nderg arten was Froebel. And sh e sent me to 
a school wh ere they taught kinderg arten teaching
, and one of the reasons she also did that 
is because the Swartzes that gave me an affidavit to come to
 the United States, 

Mrs. Swartz, who were distant relatives of ou
rs had a nursery school. And so she felt like 
I could make my self useful th
ere. And although I didn't spea
k the language that well, I 
only had four years of English and four year
s of French. I spoke a little English, but not 
really well. I also took private tutor lessons
 from an English teacher to become a little 
more fluent in English, which I reallyit help
ed a little bit, but when
 I came to the United 
States, I felt like everybody 
had chewing gum in their mouth, and I couldn't  even 
understand one word .
 
Q: I assumed that when she took 
you out of school a
nd put you in th ese ot
her classe s, tha t 
she was telling you about wh at her plan was for you?
 
A: She did tell me a plan that
 she felt like it was important fo
r me to get a little more of 
an education and learn something because most
 likely I will have to go to work because I 
couldn't, you know, continue going to school 
because there was nobody really to pay for 
me. And the folks that I came to
 live with were wonderful, 
but they never said that I 
could go back to school. I wa
s working for her in the nurser
y school. And in a way it was 
a blessing because I was busy from morning un
til night and never had really much time 
to think. And I drove in a station wagon. I di
dn't drive the car, but I drove in the back to  
pick up the children from nursery school. It 
was a private school, mostly for very, very 
wealthy ch ildren and it helped me a lot becau
se I learned to speak the language quick ly 
and the Swartzes were
 wonderful to me.
 
Q: And your mother talked 
to you about going to Baltimor
e, and the family that you 
would be staying with and 
what you would be doing?
 
A: Yes, she mentioned it. She mentioned it. A
nd th at's why sh e felt like I ought to take 
this further and get a little more information 
about handling children. 
But when I first got 
there, it was hard because I di
dn't speak the language that 
well. But within a year, I was 
almost fluent with it. And I got a little pocket 
money when I first star
ted out. And then as 
the years went on, I made a little more money, and that was that.
 
Q: Marion, I wanted to ask you now about th
e particular arrangements that your mo ther 
made for you to  get out of the country  
and why she chose those arrangements?  
 
A: When  my  brother, Fred, went down town  in Hamburg to get a quota number, I don't 

know if it was a Post Office or the cour
thouse, I don't even know that, but he was 
supposed  to get himself a quota numb er. And wh
ile he got that numb er, he also got it for 
me and he got it for my  mo ther, but he coul
dn't get it for my fath
er except a Hungarian 
number. The quota numbers were
 by what country you were 
born, not what county you 
lived in. And my  brother Fred was born in  
Hungary, and my  dad 
was born in Hungary , 
and my  brother, Henry, was born in  Germa
ny, and I was born in Germany, and my  
mo ther was born in Germany. So our numbe
rs were called so mu
ch earlier than the 

Hungarian numbers. Hu ngary is a small country
 and so it took forever to call them and 
when  we  
 
{ Interview interrupted by a change of tape } 
 
Q: This interview is being made on behalf
 of the United States Holocaust Memorial 
Museum. The interview is contin
uing with Marion Friedman. Th
is is Side Two or Side B 
of the first tape of the interview. And it'
s Novemb er the 22nd, 1997. Marion, we were 
talking ab out the process by wh ich you we
re beginning to leave Germany yourself.
 
A: About our quota numb ers, right? Well, the 
quota numb er was very difficult. It did not 
let anyone from Hungary out fo
r a good wh ile. And my  mo ther had a quota numb er with 
me. And wh en we were called, my two brothers
 were out already. When we were called, 
my mother wouldn't go with me
 because she felt like she wanted
 to stay with dad because 
she had all of her good life with him and so sh e was going to stay with him. And I got out 
and my  parents stayed home. And the leavi
ng was very, very difficult. My dad did not 
really want me to leave and so it made it 
very hard. I left from Hamburg, Germany.  
 
Unfo rtunately, my  parents could not get a 
passage on the shipon the ship right from 
Hamburg. It was very much over
booked. So I had to go to Tr
ias to catch the boatI was all 
of 15 years old and very imma
ture, really a baby because I 
was spoiled. And my parents 
saw me to the train station. Everything was 
arranged. And the arrang
ement was that I was 
going to  Trias. Somebody in Trias was meeti
ng me from the hotel close to the railway 

station and picking me up and 
bringing me to the hotel. I was spending th e night, and 
then they were going to take 
me back to the train to go to
 Trias. I was supposed to gooh, 
I'm sorry, I forgot to track
 back because I was going to  Kern, Colo gne. And th e 
arrangements were that somebody was meeting 
me there in Kern an d picking me up and 
taking me to the hotel, and spending th e night
 and the next day taking me to the train 
station to go to Trias. And those were th
e arrangements. Well, let me go back. When I 

left Hamburg, and my  parents took me to 
the train, my  aunt and uncle and my  two 
cousins and my  best girlfriend who I was 
friends with  ever since grammar school, 
everybody came to the train. 
And needless to say, everybody was crying including me 
very much so. And my father wa
s very upset. And just before 
I left, my parents wanted to 
give me something I had always
 wanted. And they had brought 
me this lovely trench coat 
for the trip. I always wanted 
that with the flaps on top.
 And I guess I was a ty pical 
teenager. And so  anyway we got onto the trai
n station. The train arrived and it was a lot 
of exciteme nt and a lot of kissing and a lot of 
crying. And I got on the train. And as I was 
waving, I remember saying my raincoat isn 't 
here. My raincoat isn '
t here. Well, even my 
cousin couldn't catch the train,
 but it really wasn 't so terr
ible because Imy parents could 
have sent it to me. And anyway I got to Co
logne. And it was a nice ride. I had pleasant 
company in the compartmen
t and somebody camesomebody was there already waiting 
with a sign with my name Tiau
te Solomos (ph), please, you 
know, answer. And so I went 

to him and he took me by car to the hotel
. I had dinner there and went right to bed 
because I was tired emotionally and physica
lly, very much so. Well I wasn 't a dreamer 
normally, but in the middle out of
 nowhere, I heard 
my  mo ther saying Ti
aute, that's what 
she used to call me. And I thought I was dr
eaming. And then I heard something knocking 
on th e door again. An d I still thought I was 
dreaming, but I wasn't dreaming. My mo ther 
had taken the next train and come and rode a
ll night th rough and got into Co logne around 
four or 5:00 in the morning to bring me 
the raincoat. And they decided to sp endshe 
decided to spend the day with me in Cologne
 because my train wasn 't leaving until that 
night. Well, to begin with, th
ey didn't want to do it because it was co stly, and they didn't 
feel like they should spend that money, but I 
guess they decided in the last minute that 
my mother wanted to do it 
anyway. So we spent the whol
e day in Cologne and it was 
really wonderful. We went sightseeing. We di
d everything together. It was sad, but it was 
wonderful. And forgive me. I 'm a little tearyeyed.
 So then from there we
 went to the train 
station at night. And she put me on the train 
and all of the crying started again. Excu se 
the interruption, but it is very emotional. A
nd we had to  leave again so all of the kissing 
and the goodbyes went again. An d I went off 
to Trias. And my  mo ther took th e train back 
to Hamburg. Well, we got to Trias, and th
ere again were arrangements and the travel 
agent seen that we were takenthat I was take
n to a hotel which was right in the harbor. 
And it was the worse hotel I have ever seen
 in my whole life. And it was a terrible 
experience because there were 
lots of sailors there.  And I was really  scared. But I 
managed okay. I lock ed my  doo
rs. I went to sleep. And the 
next mo rning I was supposed 
to in Trias get the boat, whic
h was going around the ship  of
 Italy, I mean, the shore of 
Italy, excuse me, the shore of Italy and my 
parents just felt like it w as wonderful for me 
to take that trip because Go
d knows when I ever come back
 to Europe, and they thought 
it would be a wonderful experience for me be
cause it was a beautiful trip. Well, Hitler 
marched into Poland. That's  what
 they told us. And they cancel
ed the trip and left us in 
this horrible hotel. And I had to  stay there 
for three days. They  gave us just enough 
money fo r the meals, very badly. The whole th
ing was very bad. And 
then th ey put us on 
a train after three days and the train was like 
a cattle train. It stopped at every little stop.  
And we sat on the train all night until we got to
 Geneva. And I know it 
wasn't that long of 
a drive normally. Well, we got to Geneva and th
ey transported us to the ship wh ere you're 
getting your passage to get on th e ship. And it
 was a great big car. I really didn't know 
anybody. There was one couple I 
got a little bit familiar with 
who were very kind to me. 
And wh en I went out for dinner, 
they took me. We went to dinner togeth er, which helped  
a lot. Well, we got into this port in Geneva
 and they had on th e track, right there waswas 
the alphabet and you were supposed to stand 
in line to wait for your passage for yourto 

get on th e ship. Well, my  name was Salomo s (ph) wh ich I mentioned befo re so I was 

standing under "S" and we got in there at 7:
00 in the mo rning. And by five or 4:00 or 
4:30, they closed the office. 
And they made an announcement 
that everybody who is left 
has to go back to the hotel 
and wait there. Well, I was very
, very tired. And I was just 

beside my self. I wasn't  going to  go back  into 
the horrible port hotel, 
these two, they were 
important. They  booked us into th etook us to
 the cheapest little hotel and they were 
horrible. And I just sat on my  suitcase and ev
erybody else was leaving. And I just sat on 
my  suitcase and cried my  eyes out. As I said
 I was spoiled and I gu
ess I shouldn't have 
done that, but I did it. And some young ma
n came up and asked me what was the matter.  
He was part of the ship line. And he said he 
was very sorry, he couldn't help me at all, but 
he'll call the manager of the department and I sa
id well I'll sleep here
. I'm not leaving. So 
the manager came and he asked me my  name a
nd lo and behold he knew my  dad. He had 

done business in the Hamburg bank with him a
nd he knew exactly  who he was. Well, this 
gentleman was an elderly gentlemen. He took
 me for dinner right close by. He saw to it 
that I got on the boat and he was an utter 
stranger and I felt like I wanted to hug him and 
kiss him. I didn't  because I was shy at the 
time but he was a godse
nd and I think God was 
good to me because fro
m that time on I had a lot of luck
. I really did. And from there I 
got on th e boat and slept on th e boat and th
e next mo rning we sailed for the Un ited 
States.
 
Q: Marion, I'd like to back up 
a little bit, I don't think if y
ou remember it, yes, y ou do, the 
date that you left Hamburg, this
 was December of '39, wasn't it?
 
A: Yes. Yes, it was Decemberit w as Decembe
r '39 and it was aboutit must have been 
about the 5th of December if 
I am correct. And the name of
 the line, the ship, was the 
Saturnia and our experience was very unusua
l on that ship . The ship was very nice and 
everything went very  smoothly and one night 
on the sh ip they hadthey had dancers, it 
was like a regularalmost like a cru ise line. 
And somebody asked me to dance, a young 
med student that had told me his story. He
 was studying in Poland. He was not Jewish, 
but he couldn't get into med sc
hool so he studied in Pola
nd because of the war and all 
what was going on, he was coming back . So we
 were dancing and all of a sudden in the 
middle of the dance, we noticed that the ma
chinethe noise of the 
ship had stopped and 
everybody was leaving the party 
down  there and going to the 
sideside of the boat, what 
do you call the side of the boat? An yway, an
d what had happened, you could see in the 
distance a tiny little pole coming out of the wa
ter. In spite of the fact it was dark, you 
could see it. And it was the firs
t time in my whole life that 
I had ever seen in person a 
submarine coming to th e top of
 theexcept in the movies I saw it, but it was very, very 
exciting and very  scary. Well, what had happ
ened is that it was a French submarine and 
they were taking two of the men and th e wo men were hysterical and crying an d 

screaming, off of the ship, two or three. Th
ey were chemists. They were engineers and 
chemists and they wanted some
 information. They took them
 off of the sh
ip with the 
promise that they would arrive in the United 
States within a short time. Well, after I got 
to the states and after I got to Baltimore, ther
e was a big article in the paper about it. They 
had the sh ip. The ship's name was the Saturn
ia, that these fellows were physicists, maybe 
that's what they were. I rea
lly don't remember. 
I'm sorry, but it was a very, very scary 

experience because we thoughtI
 don't knowwe were really scared. And th ey took them 
the men. And the article in the paper descri
bed how th ey had come back to the United 
States. They wanted some information an
d I to this day don't know what it was.
 
Q: When you left in December of '39, did 
you know or have the sense that this was 
approaching the last opportunity for Jews to
 get out of the country ? And wh at was your 
mo ther saying to  you about your parents comi ng to  the Un ited States?
 
A: When I left  I'm sorry, I forgot to me
ntion that. My parents through th e whole time 
while we were making arrangements for this 
trip, my mother kept
 saying don't worry 
about it. We'l l get there. They
 will call our quota. We will se
e you I bet within a year we 
will be there. Well, she brainwashed me and so
 did my father. They all thoughtthey'll be 
there and everything will be oka
y again. And I lived with that
 thought all of these years 
when I first came all of these months that I 
was sure my parents were coming. Well, need 

I say more. They didn't come. My father wa
sparents were both ta
ken to concen tration 
camp. I have a letter here, which I brought. And 
I just hadn't seen that
 letter in 40 years. I 
put all of my  parents' letters 
in a box, and I hadn't looked at it in a long time. And in  this 

much I had this interview I 
brought them out, and I found a letter from my  aunt where 
she was telling me in the letter that she was 
packing up things. This
 letter was written in 
1946. She was packing up thi
ngs becauseshe was helping my  parents and my  mo ther get 
ready because the Gestapo was 
picking them up to  take them
 to concentration camp.  
Well, I didn't know all of this until after th
e war was over. I didn't find out about it. And 
then I also heard from my  aunt's  husband, my 
mo ther's brother that the Naxis approach ed 
her and said  you divorce that Jew and we w
ill let you go. And evid ently my mother used 
the same w o rds she told me: I 
had the good years with him, I'm going to have the bad 
years and hopefully those bad years will get g
ood again. Well, unfortunately they didn't 
get good again. My dad died 
on the train because he was di
abetic and he didn't have any 
shots and by all rights I think th e Naxis shoul
d have let her go, but they didn't. They  
brought her into concentration camp . She went
 to Minsk and I had heard they made her 
work  in the laundry and then sh e went to the 
gas chambers in later years and that was it.
 
Q: How do you know th e details 
of your father's death, that 
is, that he died in the car on 
the way and how do you know what little you kno
w about your moth er's death in Minsk? 
 
A: I really don't know much about that 
except that my Uncl
e Willie who was my 
nonJewish uncle and work ed fo r 
the government in a small wa
y. I really don't know what 
he did ex actly, found out that my  father died 
on the train. They  did not give him insulin, 
and he was a very bad diabetic 
and he couldn't exist. And he 
also told me th
at my  mo th er 
was brought into the concen tration camp and made
 to work in  the laundry. And that's all I 
heard, and she died, too. And it was just unbe
lievable. To this day, I have a hard  time 
really accepting it.
 

Q: When  your aunt writes you this letter in 
1946, she's referring back to an earlier period 
when she helped your pa
rents to get ready. I assume that was 1941.
 
A: Yeah, it must have been much  earlier because I got letters after '3 9. The firstoh, quite a 
few months I would say we we
re still able to correspond. 
And I had met in the meantime 
several people, you know, a lot of people. An
d I met a man who we fell in love and I was 
writing my  mo ther that I was going to get married and she says, you know, she was very 

happy. My parents were both ha
ppy about that, but she kept saying please don't have a 
baby until I come because I want
 to be there. And that went
 on for several letters, so it 
wasn'tin fact, I brought some. And that was ve
ry hard to sustain th
at. I mean, youknow. 
Anyway that's the way it was.
 
Q: Do you have any idea aroun
d what time you would have b
een getting those letters and 
perhap s around wh at time you would have receiv
ed the last letter from your mo ther?
 
A: Gosh , I really don't remember the dates. I 
have to lo ok again on 
all of the letters, but 
some of them, I got rid of because when we
 lived in Baltimore after I gotwhen I left 
Germany and came by ship with the Saturnia
, I came to Baltimore to distant relatives 
who gave me the affidavit and 
my  brother, Henry, the affidavit and gave it to me. And I 
lived with them. They
 took me in. And I did teach 
nursery  school just like I had 
mentioned before. So  it was really a blessing 
th at my  mo th er was wi
se enough to make 
me learn these things, and that I was able 
and equipped to do some of those things 
because not speaking a language and co ming 
makes it very difficult, but thank God I 
picked it up quickly.
 
Q: Marion, you and I have agre
ed to go back to 
the time when you we
re about to leave 
Germany and come to the United 
States to live with relatives in Baltimore, and so that 
you could give mo re detail about the circumstances of that departure under the Naxis' 
scrutiny and regulations.
 
A: Yes. Just before I left, we received a list of
 things that I was allowed to take and all of 
the things that I wasn't allowe
d to take. I was allowed to ha
ve two forks, two knives, two 
spoons and silver, sterling silver. I was allo
wed to take one feather bed, wh ich was kind 
of tough to pack, but my  mo ther managed. I wa
s not allowed to take any sort of jewelry, 
even if there was any sentimenta
l attachment to it. I wasn't a
llowed to take anything else 
and the clothes I had. I mean mo re clothes than
 just on your back, bu
t we were allowed to  

take clothes, a trunkful. Well, my  aunt who wa
s a very fine seamstress sewed a lot of my  
clothes befo re I left. And I had a large trunk,
 and my mother saw to it that I had enough 

so that I wouldn't  have to spend any money 
in the United States for buying clothes. I had 

enough to last me for a couple 
of years, if so necessary. An
d my  aunt sewed all of that. 
And they  alsowell, when I left, I left with 
these things, but I also tookmy mo therI had a 
little package with junk jewelry. I would say it 
was junk. I mean, it was just little things 

from childhood, and none of it va
luable. It didn't mean anythi
ng, but it was sen timental to 
me and so I took it. I figured some day I w
ould maybe give it to my  children or whatever. 
And I took it along and many years later, when 
we werewhen  we had alreadywhenafter I 

had gotten married and 
had children and moved 
to Greensboro and 
my husband, we built 
a home. My husband said to me before we 
moved in there, you know, honey, you ought 
to get rid of some of that stuff you'v e got th
ere. And we looked through this little jewelry 
pack and threw away a lot of the things because they were really just child 's jewelry, and 

I really didn't need and we didn't and then  ou
r attention drew to one particular thing in 
there, which was dark, dark brown, and it 
was like little links, with
 a little chain on the 
end. Well, he looked  at that and he says 
you know wh at, you ought to take that tomo rrow 
to the jeweler and ask him if that was junk, t
oo, because I really can't tell. Well, I took it 
the next day, and it turned out 
that my  mo ther had dropped that piece into either vinegar 
or browned it with brown shoe polish. And th
e jeweler to ld me it was 18 karat gold, solid, 
and it was a very lovely bracelet, which I didn't  rememb er at all. And she must have just 

stuck it in there and wanted to be sure th
at if I get stopped by
 the Naxisthey did go 
through my luggage, but they ne
ver looked in there, and if th
ey had I wouldn't have been 
nervous because I would have 
never known because I knew not
hing about it. So I came 
out pretty good out of that. 
Because it would have been a di
saster if I had known . I would 
have been so nerv ous.
 
Q: Do you know of any possi
bility that you might have be
en able to leave with a 
sponsored group rather 
than go alone as you did to th
e United States? Do you remember 
any discussions about th
at with your family? 
 
A: Never heard about that, and I never heard 
it being mentioned an
ywhere that I could 
get out with a group. I think it was too late. 
In '39 not many people 
got out anymore. It 
was December '39.
 
Q: Did your passport or visa or affida
vit label you as a Jew, and if so, how?
 
A: Yes, mywhen I took out the passport, rene
wed my  passport, they put Sarah in there. 
And many years later when  I went
 back to Germany, I had misplaced my  birth certificate. 
The woman said, you know, I'm su
re your name isn't Sarah so 
I'll be happy to  take it out 
when I redo your birth certificate.
 
Q: Marion, now, why 
don't you tell me about the circumst
ances under which your parents 
were taken away by the Naxis and as was re
lated to you by your au
nt and a letter that 
you've brought fo r us to copy fo r the Ho locau
st mu seum file dated some time in 1946? 
 
A: After all of these years, I unpacked a pa
ck ag e, w h ich  w a s v e ry  
painful to me and I 

never looked at it anymore. And one of the 
letters I found was from my aunt and it was 
dated, like you just said. And she mentions 
in thereI have the letter in my  hand right 
hereshe mentions in there that
 tomo rrowno, your mo
ther told me that how happy sh e is 

that you left and the boys left, and especia
lly you because she felt the Naxis were coming 
tomo rrow and sh e wasmy aunt and uncle were 
helping my  parents to get ready fo r this 
trip. She sewed heavy linings into an old fu
r coat of hers. They had prepared their 
clothing, and my  mo thermy  aunt made a sugge
stion, how about if I take these dishesmy  
parents had very beau tiful dishes, and they  
had very  beautiful things all together. She 

says how about if I take these dishes home 
and save them for hot toddy? And my  mo ther 

said no. I want her to have everything, but 
I don't want you to  take that because if the 
German government finds out, they  might have
 a record of everything. I think th ey do, 

and if they find out, things will 
get even worse for us so just
 leave them. So consequently 
they left everything, all paintings, silver. We 
had a silver tray with beautiful bows on it. 
They  left everything. And the German gove
rnment came in there and to ok the whole 
place, everything. And I got prac
tically nothing. I got nothing.
 
Q: I'm going to jump  ah ead to one of your 
return trips to Germa
ny and your discovering 
some of the things that had 
been in your parents' home wh
en you visited a relative's 
home.
 
A: Oh, gosh, this is very painfu l because I 
was reallythis was really a dear aunt. She 
seemed lik e she was sincere and she seemed
 like they meant well 
and her husband was 
my  mo ther's brother, but theywe
 were Jewish and they  both we
re not. And it made it very 
hard wh en  I visited their home, and wh en I 
came back the first tim
e to Germany. And I 
saw paintings, which were very familiar. I k n ew
 they were my parents, but I didn't want 
to come right out with it. And 
I said God, that looks familiar. And she said oh, yes, she 
says that is yourthose are yo
ur parents' paintings. And then I looked around an d I saw 
several mo re things, wh ich were my  pa
rents. My mo ther had a very  large 
selectioncollection of demitasse that goes ba
ck. Some were like one hundred years old, 
they were old, old demitasse. And she mu st ha
ve had 40 or 50 at least. Well, a bunch of 

those demitasse were sitting in 
my aunt and uncle's home. An
d it just killed me to think 
that they wouldn't have said, you know, for me 
to take it. Well, just before we left, she 
made a comment and she said, honey, if you wa
nt to takeshe called me
 sweetie, in other 
word s. She says if you want 
some of your mo th er's demitasse, why don't you pick  a few 
you like the best and take them. Well, I wasn
't  proud. I took th em, but I should have 
taken them all really. And it really hurt me
 badly that even my  own family would do 
something like that. I really couldn't belie
ve it. And not only that, they also changed 
silverware. That I remember my
 motherI have a letter of my mother's where she wrote me 
that she exchanged all of her silverware from 
my  uncle and aunt's plated silver. And they  
had sterling silver for 24, well P.S., I never he
ard about that when I 
got back to Germany. 
And wh en I asked, nobody knew anything about
 that. And I know th at that's the way it 
was. I'm positive. I would give
 my left fingers for it because I know. I know. And that 
was the end of that. We justI mean he
re's my own relatives that did that.
 

Q: Is there anymore in that 
letter about your parents' depart
ure that you'd like to put on 
the tape? 
 
A: No, not really. I have lots of letters here
, and you ju st took the copy of them. And if 
anybody wants to read it in Ge
rman, they are welcome to it, 
but it's just too pain ful for 
me to keep going over and over.
 
Q: I believe you mentioned that through so
me portion of 1941, you were still h earing 
from your mo ther, and her happiness that you had made it safely to America.
 
A: Right, and I do want to men
tion th at I have a friend in Ha
mburg I went to school with. 
And we retained this friendship all of these years. And she went to  visit my  mother 
everymy parents every single week  befo re th
ey went to  concen tration camp . And if 
anyone had caught them or seen
 them going into this buildi
ng, th ey could have been 
taken to concentration camp. And it would ha
ve been horrible because if you go in to a 
home, that's a different story, you know, yo
u are visiting a Jewish home, but they were 

the only ones and the four occupants of that 
build ing who were Jewish. So  wh en she went 
in there, she took a chance, but sh e hadshe c
ould always say well I we
nt to visit such and 
such. She knew the 
names of all of the occupants in that build ing. So  she took a chance 

and she went in. And my  mo ther
 used to write me that sheh
er name was Gertrude (ph) 
and came every single week to visit her just 
to keep  her comp any, 
so there are lots of 
good people in this world, and ev en in Germany.
 
Q: Okay . Let's jump  ahead a bit here. Stop 
me if youactually before we jump  ahead, I 
would like you to talk to me 
a little bit about the photographs
 you brought, 
even though I 
have made copies for the file, I'
d like for you to describe the 
earliest picture that you have 
of your parents with y
our brother, Henry, right?
 
A: Right.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: Well, this was a picture of wh en my  pare
nts weren 't married too,
 too long. I would say 
my  brother, Henry, was about ten,
 12 years old. My father is 
in the Hungarian uniform. It 
has to be Hungarian because 
he was in the Hungarian Army
. And my mother is sitting 
there in a beautiful dress with a beautifulwh
at they used to call in Germany, a collier, 
which had about oh, four or five diamonds on
 one side, and four on the other side, and 
the center diamond which was a little larger, 
which many years later during Naxi days 
they sold  and lived  on part of the time. And I cherish this pi
cture, and I brought it to the 
museum because this is the wa
y they looked when 
they were young. 
And then during the 
Hitler days, my brother who went to China, 
my brother, Fred, sent me a postcard, which 
was one of the last postcards he ever rece
ived from our father. 
And on the other sideon 
the side of the postcard was a picture of my 
father, my mother and 
me, the last picture 

before I left. And I brought that also. And th
e postcard, what he wr
ote my  brother, it's 
written on the other side. And I believe you also
 have a copy of th
at. But it's just a 
personal postcard. It doesn't  
say anything because they wouldn't send a postcard with 
anything dangerous to say because 
it was pretty late then already.
 
Q: Can you tell, Mario n  what, the date is
 on that postcard? I'm trying to read it.
 
A: It looks like '38 to me, but I'm not sure. 
That could be it. Yeah, because I was leaving 
in '39. And I guess it was
 
Q: That's right, and Henry was 
already there. That's  right.
 
A: This is
 
Q: Fred was already there in China, and so 
that makes sense. The date was confusing. 
Okay.
 
A: It is confusing.
 
Q: All right. And then th e last picture is of 
you as a baby, so why don
't we take a look at 
that? 
 
A: Yes. Oh, that was just the picture. This 
was just the picture of
 me in a pretty little 
dress with a big bow, which really has no meani
ng of anything else. It's just that we had a 
good life once upon a time, a
nd it was sad what happened. An
d I miss my  parents. And I 
feel like it was such a terrible 
injustice that h appened earlie
r. You want me to start? I 
think we need to also mention that I wa
s sponsored by a wonderfu
l family that was 
supposed  to be either second or
 third cousins of my dad's. And th ey lived in  Baltimore. It 
was an old family. The name was Mano Sw
artz Furrier. Their business was furs. And 
they give my  brother, Henry, an affidavit.
 Henry was a doctor, my  oldest brother, and 
gave me an affidavit. And his son and his wi
fe who had two children 
took me into their 
home like a daughter. And this is
 the family I worked for in 
the nursery school. And this 
is the family who really got me on my feet
. And this is the fam
ily who gave me my  
wedding when I got married.
 
Q: Tell me how you met your husband.
 
A: Well, it's a short story. I was living w
ith th e Swartzes who have a nursery school. 
Mrs. Swartz had a nursery school. He has a fu
r store andLaura Sw artz. And Laura Swartz 
had the camp out at in Baltimore in the coun
try, the children's camp
, quite big and quite 
lovely. And my the man I married used to 
be in the printing business and did their 
yearbook for the camp, and did all of the ad
vertising for the nursery school. And one day 
I was in my slippers looking like little orpha
n Annie and I was walk
ing th rough the living 
room, not knowing that Laura Swartz was having
 a meeting with this 
man that I thought, 
you know, I wasn't even aware 
of what is going on. And she 
introduced me to him. And 

then later on she came to me and asked me, he
 asked her if he could date me, and we 
started dating. And four months
 later he asked me to ma rry him, and two months later we 
got married. And I had two children.
 
Q: He was in the Army, isn 't that correct?
 
A: Yes, after we were married. I h ad one son 
already. He went into th e service and he 
was stationed with a first army  and, oh, God,
 whatever. And wh en my  son was not even  a 
year old, he went into th e service and when
 he was threeandahalf years old, he came 
back. So  he didn't even know his son. And 
his son didn't know him at all. And it was 
really quite a reunion. And my  son only knew 
him by looking at his picture. And wh en he 
came back, I was at th e time teaching at camp. 
I was in charge of th e nursery school. And 
when he came back, I took a bl
anket, and we all went out in
 the woods. I got a substitute 
for me for the day. And my little
 boy looked at him and says
 go away from me, you're not 
my  daddy. My daddy is sitting on my  chiffo
robe. And so we'v e had really quite a few 
experiences.
 
Q: You mentioned that your hu
sband had been present at th
e opening or the liberation of 
some of the concentration camps with 
the first army , didn't you tell me that?
 
A: No.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: See, the concentration camps after they 
just had been liberated, and th e horrors, and 
what had happened. And from the time he came 
back, rightly so, he had a terrible, terrible 
hate against the Germans. Would never buy 
a German car. Never buy any German china. 
Never do anything in Germany, anything conn
ected with it. But then
 as the years went 
on, many, many years later, I want
ed to go back because I had th
is very dear girlfriend in 
Germany and Iwe wanted to see each other. And I still had an
 uncle and aunt there. And 
he sort of mellowed, and we went back. 
And we saw the country side. And we went 
places I had never been before
. And his famous saying was that land is too good for the 
Germans.  
 
Q: Did you go to Lubeck, 
your mo ther's hometown?
 
A: Yes, I visited Lubeck several 
times. It's a beautiful city and 
a lot of old things. It's  very 
interesting.
 
Q: Is there still family 
there, Haagen family?
 
A: No, not at all.
 
Q: How did you end up going 
from Baltimore to North Ca
rolina with your husband 
whose name was Harry Silver?
 

A: Silvers.
 
Q: Silvers. 
 
A: Right. Harry always wanted to go in 
business for himself. He was working for his 
brother after he left the printing business with
 his other brother. He has two brothers. He 
work ed fo r his brother. The comp any was 
called Shapiro & Whitehouse. It was 
Silverstein, Shapiro & Whitehou
se, well, whatever, he work ed th ere. And he was doing a 

lot of traveling. And by that time we had al
ready two more sons after he got out of the 
service several years later. And he traveled 
through th e south a great deal, and he liked 
the south. And he had a chance 
to buy into a business in Hi
gh Poin t, North Carolina, but 
he felt like inasmuch I have al
ways lived in a big city, High 
Point was really a hick town 
at the time. It was very small town. And so
 we moved to Greensbo
ro, which was a little 
more sophisticated town, a little more broadmi
nded and had four or five colleges there. 
And we settled there, but the 
business was in High Point.
 
Q: You had mentioned to me earlier that th
ere were very few Jews in the area, and I 
wanted to  ask you two questio
ns. What made you determined to raise your children 
Jewish and what did you go

Beginning File Two
 
Q: This is an interview un der the auspicies of the Unite
d States Holocaust Memorial 
Museum. The interview is with
 Marion Friedman. The date is
 November the 22nd, 1997. 
And this is the second tape, tape two, the 
first side, Side A. Marion, we were talking 
about being Jewish and making a Jewish home
 in North Carolina wh en you moved there 
with your husband and 
your young children.
 
A: When  I moved th ere, number one, Harry was 
Jewish. And we just raisedwe just had a 
Jewish family and wethis was a Jewish ho
me. I never had a Christmas tree again, 
although I sometimes missed
 it because I did think it was beautiful, and maybe I 
shouldn't even say th at, but it was nice. But 
I got accustomed to not having it, and I was 
perfectly happy after that. And we had Hanu
kkah. We gave gifts. Our children were 
raised Jewish. They went to 
temple. Both were Bar Mitzvahe
d and quite a few years later, 
we had a little daughter, and she, too, went to
 temple and she was graduated from temple. 
What was it like, a bar mitzvah? 
 
Q: Confirmation.
 

A: Confirmation. Thank you. I think it's getting 
late. And so I did have a Jewish home. I 
lit Friday night candles. We didn't go ev ery 
Friday night, but we went, you know, with 
the children every so  often.
 
Q: When  did youyou mentioned to me earlier 
when your children be
came interested in 
issues involving Ho locaust a
nd your history in particula
r. So why don't you talk about 
that a little bit? 
 
A: Well, when they were small,
 theyweren't interested at a
ll. But since they have become 
adults, they have gotten very interested especi
ally my  older son has read all of the history 
of Germany, the history of the Naxis and 
read every book and has become thehe just 
hates everything about it. And to th is day, 
we don't argue about it. We have very hot 
discussions. He cannot understand how I coul
d ever want to go b
ack to that horrible 
country. And I tried to explain to him I ha
d a wonderful childhood. I have a very  dear 
girlfriend who was good to my 
parents. I still have an uncle and aunt if I know what I 
know now wouldn't have gone 
back so see. But he has a ha
rd time understanding, but we 
did go back. He invited me last August a year
 ago. We went back, and I think he still 
feels partially that way, but I 
think he's overcome a little bit of
 that. The hatred has almost 
changed his personality, I think. 
I mean, he's  really obsessed w
ith this German bit, but I 
think it's a very bad way to
 be because you can't live th
at way and you can't have a 
happycan't  be a happy individual if you cons
tantly harp  on th at, but I might be wrong.
 
Q: Tell me apropo of that, why don't you talk 
a little bit about what your attitude today is 
towards what happened to you and how you 
feel now about those 
experiences and how 
they'v e affected your life.
 
A: That's v ery hard for me 
to analyze exactly and come to
 the point. I have a very 
terrible, terrible loss inside of me that I had 
no parentsand it's hard and as you can tell I 
still get upset about it. But otherwise I think 
I'm fairly well adjusted. I think my life has 
been very good. And I think I 
have just through th e years cl
osed something in my  brain 
because I justI don't know if I'm ignoring it or
 how it all happened, but I just close it off 
and forge ahead and try to do
 the best with the good thin
gs, not the bad things. And I 
don't know. Nobody has ever analyzed it, but 
I just feel like there's no other way to 
explain it.
 
Q: You mentioned to me when 
we talked on the phone that it
's gotten a little b it harder to 
do th at in recent years. And I wonder 
what your thinking is about that.
 
A: Well, I think as we get ol
der, we become mo re sensitive to our heritage. And I think 
about it as a parent, but I would feel like if I 
h ad to do to that to 
my  children, you th ink 
mo re of your heritage. And I think wh at happen
s is that you relate to yourself what would 
you do if this happened to you, 
and how would you be able to 
handle it. And it breaks my 

heart to think my  parents had to
 go through all of that and 
never saw the gran dchildren or 
anything or anything, dammit.
 
Q: Marion, why don't you talk a little bit a
bouta little bit more about going back to 
Germany, specifically perhaps as a 
guest of the German government? 
 
A: Well, my feelings were very, very mixed 
because in a way I want
ed to go back and I 
wanted to  take advantage of the invitation,
 which was free for me and my husband, but I 
guess I really don't know how to 
explain th at properly becaus
e I felt like they took so 
much away from me, a
nd th ey co uld never repay me. And 
wh atever I could get back, and 
this sounds very strange to say, I would ta
ke advantage of. And Iwe went back  and than k 
God my  husband went with me and wethe Ge
rman government treated us like royalty, 
which made me sometimes almo st nauseous 
because I felt like it w as almost like an 
insult, and yet I took it for wh
at it was worth. I don't know. 
And some of the tours they  
took us to were very upsetti
ng because they took us to a 
Jewish cemetery, which they 
wanted to  move, and some of the Jewish peop
le there wanted it to be staying the way it 
was, and there was a big fight about that. Then
 they took us to an 
orth odox Jewish center, 
which was very interesting for me. I had neve
r been to anything like 
that before and we 
took partthe German govern ment gave the di
nner, but the thing was in the synagogue, 
and they  were all orthodox Jews, and I sat up
stairs. The service was very interesting, but 
it was very hard for me to understand. We 
sat upstairs, and my husband sat downstairs. 
And then after the service, we
 had dinner. And onethe pres
ident of the congregation, a 
docto r, got up and in troduced himself, and welc
omed us and also mentioned something, 
which was shocking to me. There was quite 
a large Jewish community in Hamburg now, 
and that he, himself, has done a lot of st
udies on Europe all over and moved back from 
Poland, moved to Hamburg, Germany, living 
in part of that center where we were 
visiting. And he says that he feels that 
in his own mind that Hamburg right now of 
Germany is the safest place for Jews to be be
cause everything goes in a circle, and he 
feels like this is a good place to be. And thos
e are the very words he
 used. That upset me, 
too. But otherwise the trip was very enlight
ening. And so me of the things were very 
beautiful. I had a chan ce to see my  friend in Hamburg ag ain. And that 's about it.
 
Q: Why don't you finish up the tape by te
lling me about your receiving this socalled 
black book from the German government that 
gives statistics about what happened to 
your parents during the war? 
 
A: When I received that book at first I couldn'
t believe what I saw. I felt like it was the 
worse thing I've ever seen. I mean, to write 
a book, and tell us of 
all of the Jews they 
killed and sent me a book with my parents' name
s in it, at firstmy first reaction was I was 
going to throw it in the garbage ca
n, but then I took 
a second look at it and I thought well, 
I'm going to keep it for my ch
ildren to see what really ha
ppened so nobody will ever 

forget what really happened. And I don't thin
k it would have been printed if wasn't true, 
but a lot of people think it wasn't true, but it was all true.
 
Q: Is there anything else you'd like to
 add before we finish the interview?
 
A: With all of these tragedies, I feel like 
I have still beenas much as I hated losing my 
parents and it was a great loss to
 me, I feel like I was a very 
lucky girl to go through life 
the way I didexcuse melucky to  have a wond
erful husband, and a second husband. My  
first husband died. And I had great child
ren, and we'v e had 
about as happy of 
lifeeverybody has problems, but I think we are 
all very fortunate. A
nd I think my  children 
feel that way, too. They had a gr
eat dad. And I will sign off now.
