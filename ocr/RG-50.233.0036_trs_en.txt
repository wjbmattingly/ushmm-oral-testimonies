Kensington, Maryland 
 
     

Q: Why don™t you just state your grandmother™s
 name  and the date of birth if you can 
r e me mb e r  t h a t .  
 

A: My grandmother™s name was Etta Moscowitz.  

 

Q: Etta? 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: Moscowitz, can you spell that for me ? 

 

A: Uh, let me write it. 

 

Q: Okay. 

 

A: Do you remember where she was born? 

 
A: She was born in Volosyanka. 
 

Q: And do you reme mber how old she was? 

 

A: She was about eighty. 

 

Q: She was eighty years old? 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: And that was, she was eighty, do you reme mber when? 

 

A: When they took her to Auschwitz. 

 

Q: In1942? 

 

A: Between ™42 and ™43, I™m not, you know.  I think it™s been docume nted when 
these people had been taken to Au
schwitz from where I come from. 
 

Q: Let™s see, she grew up in Volosyanka. 

  
 
2
 
A: And she lived there.  You see Jews lived there for years. 

 

Q: Did she, she was ma rried to your gr
andfather who you were telling me  about 
 

A: Right. 

 

Q: Can you tell me  his name? 

 

A: His name  was Sander.  Matter of fact my grandchild is named after him.  They 
call hi m short Seth. 
 

Q: Seth? 

 

A: Seth. 

 

Q: S-E-T? 

 

A: Yes.  SETH.  Seth.  But at home they used to call him Sander Moscowitz. 

 

Q: Okay. 

 

A: He was eight-six.  That I know for 
sure.  Because he would cry. Oy, what 
happened to him.  
 

Q: Um, now you said your grandfather 
was a very religious ma n.  Wa s your 
grandmother also? 
 

A: Sort of.  But wome n didn™t show it.  Wo
men didn™t worship as much as men did.  
He was terribly upset with God that he 
didn™t die.  You know, he had no fear of 
death.  He had no fear of death because he
 was so religious.  He felt he goes to, 
you know.  I reme mber in the ghetto when they took him to the square.  More 

older people that had beards.  He had along beard, not just a small beard, but a 

long beard.  He never got cut hi s beard becau
se of religion.  So, they got these old 
me n on the square and they were cutting thei
r beards with scissors and they were 
beating on him.  So um, you know he 
was bloody and my mother was the 

daughter, so my mother finally got to 
him.  You couldn™t go to rescue him 
because you would get shot.  I mean 
you wouldn™t get beaten up, you would get 
shot.  So she couldn™t go rescue, but when
 they were finished beating him up and 
cutting his beard, we brought him home  a
nd he was just crying terribly and we 
thought he was crying because he wa s full of pain.  You know, his face was 

bloody and black and after a few days the 
ma n just couldn™t stop crying so, uh we 
told him we understand he must be in terr
ible pain from the blows he got.  He 
says no, he doesn™t cry out of pain but he
, it™s not him, he felt so humiliated.  So 

my mother took a scarf and she put around 
his face and tied it on the top and put 

  
 
3
his hat on, he wore a black hat and some
how that ma de hi m feel better.  He 
stopped crying.  So, so.  And that™s how he went to Auschwitz a few days later. 
 
Q: That was just before. 

 

A: Just before.  I just don™t understand. 
 I don™t understand why they needed to do 
this to him.  They knew that he w
ould wind up in Auschwitz.  What happened 

was that they kept us in a ghetto until 
they accumulated enough Jews to put in 
transpor t.  Because you know the trains were ma ny and long. 
 

Q: Um, do you reme mber what your grandfat
her did for a living?  What he had 
worked at be fore? 
 

A: Yeah, they had a store, they were selli
ng flour there and sugar.
  It wasn™t a big 
store. 
 

Q: Kind of like a grocery store? 

 

A: Yes, a small grocery store.  Ye
s, sma ll.  It wasn™t a Giant. 

 

Q: And both your grandmother and 
your grandfather worked there? 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: And that was in the town? 

 
A: Yes. 
 

Q: Do you know when they got ma rried? 

 

A: No. 

 

Q: And, um how ma ny children did they have? 

 

A: Oh, they had ten boys and two girls.  And the two girls, when I was growing.  
You know, I have pictures of about six boys
 and one was in the United States and 
a few of them died, but they had a lot of children. 
 

Q: Yeah. 

 

A: I have pictures.  My mot her was 
the daughter and then I had an aunt. 
 

Q: Um, was your mother, in that family.  
Wa s she one of the older ones or one of the 
younger?  
 

A: Well, in between. 

  
 
4
 
Q: Yeah. 

 

A: Do you remember, I know it is probably difficult for you to reme mber, but do 
reme mber them talking about, or even your parents talking about when the 

Germans, the Nazis, came  to pow
er  in Germany in the ‚30™s. 
 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: Do you remember, were they frightened at all, we re they apprehensive? 

 

A: Very, very.  But I™ll tell 
you, as I talk in the tape.  If you see the tape.  We knew 
some how the Jews have suffered through 
the last 2000 years, I™m sure you know 
history.  But this has never happened before
 to no group of people.  So as much as 
we were frightened and scared, but we 
didn™t fear actual d
eath and destruction, 
the kind that has happened.  You know they 
felt, well, they are going to take the 
ma npower and they are going to work them
, or they are going to do things like 
that.  But to take small little kids an
d gas them.  We did not expect that. 
 

Q: Right.  But your pa
rents were scared? 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: They were frightened of them. 

 

A: Of what he was saying.  He was actually
 saying what he was going to do.  But, 
you know, I think human nature has a way 
of protecting themselves.  They don™t 

want to think of the worst. 
 

Q: Yeah, you said some thing about what 
he was actually saying, what Hitler 
proclaimed and these kind of things in 
speeches.  Were there radios and these 
kind of things in your town?   Not many? 
 

A: When we were Czech.  Then when th
e Hungarians came in, there was no radio.  
We had to hand in the radios.  And the ne
wspaper, the news was just not available 
any more.  But there were some  people who had hid a radio and they would come  

with some  news.  But, people wouldn™t 
even believe such things, you know what I 
mean?   If the person that had the radio, a
nd they would come  and they said they 
surrounded some  Jews a nd threw them dow
n the balcony or killed them for no 

reason, it was a little 
bit difficult to --- to. 
 

Q: Tobelieve? 

 

A: To believe in the beginning.  But then
 again and again, and again and again they 
would clean out a town.  Then they st
arted cleaning towns.  Then we ready 
understood. 

  
 
5
 
Q: Did refugees from Ger many, Germa n Jews or Polish Jews come  in to 
Czechoslovakia, do you reme mber seeing any? 
 

A: No, no.  They didn™t.  But you know, of 
course, I don™t think this has anything to 
do with my l i fe.  But when the Germans occupied Poland we lived near the Polish 

border, at that time  that was.  So the 
Polish soldiers were going through our town. 
 

Q: They came through your town. 

 

A: Yeah, when they had the war within a w
eek or 10 days they occupied Poland.  I 
mean, I don™t know, ma ybe two weeks. 
 

Q: A very short time. 

 

A: Yeah.  So, I reme mber that. 

 

Q: When did the Hungarians come  in and occupy? 

 

A: ™39. 

 

Q: Um, do you reme mber especially, you told
 me  about the cutting of the beard of 
your grandfather and things like that.  
Do you reme mber any other instances of 
anti-Semitism directed against you or  either
 your parents or  your grandparents or  
anything like that before/\? 
 
A: Well, you see it was sort of quiet while 
the Czechs were there. It was sort of, you 
know, we had a democracy.  So we were allowed to go to school.  Matter of fact I 
have an uncle that was a Czech officer 
and he was a college graduate because 
they allowed the Jews to go to school. 
 But then the Hungarians came in in ™39 
and that was already, the schools were cl
osed for Jewish kids and the synagogues 
were closed.  But, you know I reme mber I had a teacher, there were so ma ny 

children we had a teacher in the house w
ho was teaching us.  You know we called 
it a cheder. 
 

Q: Yeah.  So, did your grandpa
rents live very far from you? 
 

A: No very close, that was my happiness. 

 

Q: But you didn™t live inthe same  hous e or anything. 

 

A: No, I had very good grandparents.  We  
were also seven kids so I had loving 
parents, but you know I was the sixth chil
d.  So I wasn™t getting that muc h 
attention because there was 
no time.  They loved me , so my grandmother would 

give me  all the attention, she would talk to me .  I reme mber she was a big comfort 

to me . 

  
 
6
 
Q: Do you remember what kinds of things you would talk about? 

 

A: The fear.  The fear.  As little as I wa
s, I reme mb ered she feared.  She worried, 
when the war will be  over, what will happen to us.  That™s what I re me mb er the 

most. 
 

Q: Do you remember talking 
to her in the late 30™s. 

 

A: Yeah, when the Hungarians came we  
already felt that.  The Jewish young guys 
were taken to a work camp.  They weren™
t soldiers anymore.  The Czechs, they 
did take the Jews to be soldiers.  We 
sort of had, the Czechs we were sort of 
treated like fi rst class citizens–. Not fi rst 
class.  I mean we didn™t feel it so bad.  
It™s the Hungarians, when the Germans came there was already murder, it was 

already completely disa st er. 
 

Q: Do you remember, can you describe
 for me  your grandparent™s house? 
 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: Do you remember and where was it situated in the town? 

 

A: They had a stone house, a stone house.  
And they had lots of cows and horses and 
goats and you know, it was like a family in 
a smaller town.  It was like a normal 
fa mily, a big fa mily.  And on Saturday 
nobody worked so we would get together 
and we would have meals together. 
 

Q: At their house? 

 

A: At their house, yes.  A
nd I™ll tell you, me  as a child. 
 I thought I was a happy child 
because you know, my uncles loved me  and I wa s a child and it was, to me  it 

looked like a happy situation. 
 

Q: Was the store that they owned separate from the house? 

 

A: No, it was sort of ----here were the li
ving quarters and there 
was like a long room 
and they kept the ----tha
t™s where the store was 
 

Q: Can you tell me a little 
bit about how thi
ngs changed once the Hungarians came  
in?   especially for your grandpare
nts, how it changed their lives. 
 

A: Well, you see, I™ll start with my grandpa
rents.  That™s why 
it™s better when you 
ask me  because I go in from one to another.  Um, when the Hungarians come  in 

the Jews could no longer have stores eve
n.  The Jews could no longer do things, 
you know, because when you had a store you needed a permit.  And you know, 

they took it away from you.  So they ha
d to close the store.  And, you say, how 

  
 
7
did they live, but they had some  piece of grounds, and they had the cows that 
ma de milk a nd ma de the butter and pota
toes, they put potatoes in the ----- you 
know, they had potatoes.  It wasn™t a wonderful life and you know, they didn™t 

live in a house like I™m li
ving.  They had two rooms.  You know, they would 
survive.  To give you an example, my pa
rents by the Czechs, they had stor e, it 
was a shoe store. 
 

Q: This is your parents. 

 

A: My parents had.  They ma de a living 
room out of that.  But as soon as the 
Hungarians come in it was taken away from the m. 
 

Q: They took the store away. 

 

A: Yeah.  I me a n, I™m just showing you an example. 

 

Q: Sure.  We re there restrictions.  I kno
w that when the Germans came in to ma ny 
towns they put rest ri ctions on what the 
Jews could wear, when they could be 

outside, where they could shop, that kind 
of --- di d the Hungarians do the same  
thing?  
 

A: No, we didn™t have to wear 
a yellow star by the Hungarians. 
 

Q: I reme mber in Poland, I™ve spoken to pe
ople, they say they couldn™t walk on the 
sidewalk, they had to walk on the street 
and they couldn™t do certain things, go to 
parks. 
 

A: When the Germans ca me, but you see wh
en the Hungarians came they restricted 
us to certain extent that we tried not to 
be invisible.  Who went to the park?   I 
mean, we wouldn™t do that.  
We  wouldn™t.  Even when they wanted to worship, it 
was in secret.  It was in some body™s 
room.  And t hen you watched, you shouldn™t 
be seen going in there too ma ny time s , you see.  Then they didn™t worship every 

day anymor e.  If they could get to it on Sa
turday they would be glad to do it.  I 

mean, you know these old religious peopl
e because they were afraid of God. 
 

Q: Did, so your grandparents then would 
worship, they couldn™t worship every day 
or they would do it. 
 

A: Well, he would do it by himsel
f but not anywhere in a group. 
 

Q: So they closed the synagogue. 

 

A: Oh,yeah. 

 

  
 
8
Q: Do you remember anything else under th
e Hungarians that your grandparents ma y 
have had to do, or were they forced to 
give up some  of their property or any of 
their livestock, that
 kind of thing. 
 
A: Well, because it was a wa r.  They were taki ng it from the non-Jews too actually. 

 

Q: So, they were taking it from everybody. 

 

A: They were taking it from everybody, 
because the war was going on and there 
wasn™t enough food so, it wasn™t that pe
ople lived by laws, there was no law.  I 
mean, any hooligan.  If you beat up a Je
w, he wasn™t persecuted.  There wa s no 
place to go to complain.  There was a place, we did have police.  But, you 

couldn™t go complain some body bea t  me  up, because you would get more. 
 

Q: Right, did that happen often?   Do
 you reme mber people getting beaten up? 
 

A: Sure, sure.  Children, you know, it was 
very funny.  It was very funny because by 
the Czechs, you know, when we we nt to schoo
l we went with our neighbors.  And 
who were our neighbors, the non-Jews.  A
nd I always thought, I walk to school 
with this non-Jewish chil
d and I really thought, I m
ean, I always thought it was 
my friend.  You know, as a child you play
 with this kid, you know, this is my 
friend that I play with.  But as soon as
 the governme nt has changed and gave the 
red light to vandalism, ma ybe the people we
re scared or some thing.  You see, I 

don™t know.  So I lost my, I imme diately lost my friend, my play, you know, my 

playma te.  You see, they didn™t want anything to do with me .  I mean, I™m telling 

you from my point of view, as a child 
what bothered me .  My father bothered 
because he di dn™t have to give us a piece of bread.  But –. 
 

Q: Did your grandparents ever, um, did they
 ever tell you things 
like you were saying 
--to try to be invisible.  
Did they say things like th
at to you, tell you not to go out 
in the st reet at certain 
times or anything like that. 
 

A: You know a  child is now looking back 
on it.  If there was a wedding, let™s say 
there was a non-Jewish wedding.  By th
e Czechs we would go and watch the 
wedding.  I liked to go and watch a weddi
ng, so I went and I watched a we dding 
and I came back and, you know, I was let free by the Czechs.  But when the 

Hungarians came, you know, my
 mother wouldn™t let me  go anymore.  I™m just 
giving you a small example that she w
ouldn™t let me go because everybody in 
town knew I was Jewish and therefor
e I was ___________.  Do let™s say there 
were even 10 good non-Jews, but you would 
always find one that would want to 
get me  over the head.  You know what I™m saying? 
 

Q: Uh, huh, okay let™s see.  So. 

 

A: I jut gave you an example.  Or let™s say, lots of examples. 

 

  
 
9
Q: Goahead. 
 

A: But, I don™t want to take too much ---- I mean this was just that a child™s, 
especially because I was a little girl I liked
 to look at a bride or something.  But 
ma ny things, at night definitely you woul
dn™t go out.  Oh, definitely you wouldn™t 
go out.  Like, you know, if we needed, then if
 went to the store they would sell us, 
they would sell us if we had the money, th
ey would.  But, well, we™re still talking 
about the Hungarians now or the Germans? 
 

Q: The Hungarians, yeah. 

 

A: Okay, like, I wouldn™t be allowed, the children we ren™t allowed no more to go 
like to the store.  Some times my uncle would give me  25 cents and I would go 

and buy an ice cream.  I no longer, they wouldn™t allow me  to go by myself.  You 

know, if they brought it into the house
, you know.  At that time there was no 
money to, you know.  At that time if my moth
er could get some different things to 
survive, but you know, they w
ouldn™t let us go out.  My brother would go and get-
--- then they also took him away too, uh.  I had an older brother than this. 
 

Q: Olderthanthis? 

 

A: Yeah, I had an older brother.  But 
then they took him away to work, you know. 
 

Q: What was his name ?  

 

A: His name was Larry, my son is named after him.  We called him Libel, but my 
son is name d after him.  His name  is Larry. 
 

Q: uh, huh.  Can you tell me a little bit 
about when the Germans came?   You know, 
what year it was and what happened,
 how life changed at that point. 
 

A: Well, when the Germans came, they right
 away said that the Jews can not only, 
they could only go out, let™s say, a couple of hours a day.  Not only at night, a 

couple of hours a day and if you found a 
Jew on the street, you know, wanting to 
buy some thing you could be shot for that 
or you could be taken away to this 
concentration camp which even
tually wound up in Auschwitz.  So the Jews had to 
wear the Jewish stars, even children.  
And then the non-Jews were not allowed to 
sell to Jews or aid them in any way.  You see they gave, when the Germans came 

already, I™ll tell you, I don™
t blame the non, at that time, you know I read now, I 
know there were some  very righteous non-Je
ws that really, what they did, I don™t 
know if I would do it today when I have
 children and grandchildren because 

would they aid a Jew, they would be take
n away to a concentration camp.  So the 
punishme nt was so tremendous of aiding a Je
w that he hims elf wasn™t safe.  I™m 

talking the non-Jew wasn™t safe.  That
 was by the Germans, by the Germans. 
 

Q: Do you remember when the Germans came to town? 

  
 
10
 
A: I think it was between ™42 or ™
43, but you know, I am not sure exactly. 
 

Q: I can look it up. 

 

A: Yeah, because you have the town and I™m sure. 

 

Q: Uh, how long, now you said, and you told
 me  the story about your grandfather 
having his beard cut and everythi
ng before they were deported. 
 

A: That was after they took us 
away from home  into a ghetto. 
 

Q: Okay. 

 

A: That wasn™t while we were home.  But, when the Germans came, though, they 
worked so fast, they worked so fast.  If 
I, within weeks they took us to a ghetto, 

within weeks and they put us into the ghetto. 
 

Q: So you were taken away to the ghetto w
ithin a few weeks of them comi ng into 
your town. 
 

A: Yes, within weeks, it wasn™t months. 

 

Q: And they took every Jew in the town, whoever was Jewish in the town they took 
to the ghetto? 
 
A: Yes, yes.  Now you see, it™s true.  Y
ou know, I™ve always had this color, now I 
have to put a little color b
ecause I am white.  But I was alwa ys this color so when 
I talk ma ny people ask me , you don™t look Je
wish.  I say how is a Jew supposed to 
look?   So, it wasn™t, what happened was, the non-Jews handed us over to the 
Germans.  You know what I™m saying? 
 

Q: They pointed you out. 

 

A: Yeah.  Even we had to have a Star of
 David on the house too.  But, let™s say they 
didn™t know that my parents had seven ki
ds.  But, the non-Jews , so there was no 
place to hide and they were 
afraid to hide us because 
if they™re gonna find us then 
they™ll go where we are.  So 
it was a no-win situation there. 
 

Q: Can you tell me  the name of th
e town that the ghetto was in? 
 

A: Uhzgorod, it was a bigger town.  It wa sa city, I would call that a city already. 

 

Q: How far from your town was it? 

 

A: I™m not sure. 

  
 
11
 
Q: Not very far or a long wa y. 

 

A: No, it was maybe an hour ride 
with a train.  It wasn™t ---- 
 

Q: So they put you on trains.  Wa s 
there a train station in your town? 

 

A: Yes, there wa s a train station in our town. 

 

Q: So, did you all go together -- 
your family, your grandparents? 
 
A: My grandparents and the stronger uncles 
were taken away to work.  My brother 
Larry was taken away to work.  My brot
her Saul was taken away to work.  But 
the rest of them, the s m
aller children.  That™s an
other thing, you know they 
planned that so by the time they ca me to 
take us to the gas chambers that there 
wasn™t enough strong manpower, they left
 the old people, the little kids, the 
wome n, the older, you know.  They 
planned it so just in case ---- 
 

Q: So there wouldn™t be any resistance. 

 

A: And another thing that they ask me
 many times, well how come you didn™t fight 
back?   Jews were such law abiding citi
zens that not only that, but if some body 
would have found it was against the law 
to have a gun in the house.  So, you 
know, Jews just didn™t keep guns in the hous
e.  I spoke in front of officers, Navy 
officers, and that was their first questi
on and I understood what they were saying, 
it™s just that I don™t know if
 I could have given them 
a sufficient enough answer of 
the situation that was there.  When 
you don™t have a gun and you don™t have the 
ma npower anymore, how can you fight?   
Then nobody really knew that you™re 
going to a gas chamber, it was a big secret. 
 

Q: Often times a German would tell you th
at you were going to work or something 
like that. 
 

A: Relocated.  They said they need ma npower to work. 

 

Q: Uh,huh. 

 

A: But, I™ll tell you, the way 
they dealt, we should have
 known some thing is horribly 
wrong.  The way they dealt with a huma n being, if they wanted to ma ke us work, 

you don™t go and beat some one to death or 
beat some one half dead, you know.   It 
was, you know, we weren™t dealt like we were human. 
 

Q: Yeah.  Can you describe to me  a little bit about what you reme mber of the ghetto 
in Uhzgorod? 
 

  
 
12
A: Well, also again they didn™t keep us l
ong in the ghetto either
 because it was like, 
you know.  I think they knew when we were
 there that the war, now looking back 
on it they didn™t keep us l
ong in the ghetto either.  Bu
t, the living quarters, the 
ghetto was a brick factory, they emptied 
out a brick factory, it was big.  There 
were no beds or kitchens in a brick fact
ory, so we brought some blankets with us, 
you know we carried certain things and they
 gave us a little place there in the 
ghetto where we stayed, where we had our
 little place on the floor.  Then they 
gave us rations, soup, you know, in the morn
ing coffee, and at night soup.  Of 
course the living quarters were horrible, 
there wa s no place to wash and the kids, 
there were no bathrooms.  So, it was a horri
ble situation.  And the worst of all, we 
didn™t know what would happen next. All we
 saw is that every day they brought 
in more Jews, more Jews.  We just di
dn™t know what they were going to do with 
us. 
 

Q: How long did you stay there, do you reme mber?   Not very long? 

 

A: probably months, just ma ybe, I don™t know. 
 Maybe a month or two at the most.  
From what I reme mber, it wasn™t, you know
 like the Polish Jews were in ghettos 
for years, but this wasn™t a work ghetto.  
The Polish Jews were in a work ghetto.  
This was not a work ghetto. 
 

Q: This was mo re like, ma ybe a transit point? 

 

A: Yeah, they got us together and shipped 
us to Auschwitz.  B
ecause at that time 
already they had the capacit
y, you see with the Polish Jews they didn™t probably.  
They didn™t have the capacity of destroyi
ng that ma ny, so they had to kill them by 
bullets.  So, you know, it was different.  But 
with us, they could gas thousands of 
them. 
 

Q: So, let™s see, you were ther
e for a mo nth ma ybe two months? 
 

A: Months, I would say mo nths. 

 

Q: Some where in there.  Now, would this be
 in ™43 or  still in 
™42 or right around --- 
 

A: Right around the mi ddle, between ™42, 
™43 ma ybe.  Let™s say ™43 already. 
 

Q: And then you were deported to Auschwitz. 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: In a train?  

 

A: Yes, in a cattle car train. 

 

Q: Uh,huh. 

  
 
13
 
A: And then, I™ll tell you, when I think back
 on that ride, you know they put so ma ny 
people into that cattle car. 
 We  had no bathrooms, small kids, sick people, they 
just packed us in there.  You know, if
 they would have taken us to work 
some place they wouldn™t have done to us what they did.  Just even the transport, 

that in itself should have said some thi
ng to us.  But we couldn™t imagine, we 
couldn™t imagine that we™re going to the 
gas chamber. We  couldn™t ima gine that. 
 

Q: Did, so your grandparents are still with
 you.  We r e  they in the car with you? 
 

A: Yes,yes. 

 

Q: Can you tell me  what happened when the train came  to Ausc hwitz? 

 

A: Well, it stopped.  It stopped and the sme
ll.  You™re probably goi
ng to see, I think I 
do tell --- 
 

Q: Inthetape. 

 

A: I tell the day in Auschwitz, one day in
 Auschwitz I think I tell.  And, um, you 
know.  If you want me  t o I™ll tell you. 
 

Q: Goahead. 

 

A: I can tell it again?   Because I want to 
tell you new stuff, not repeating myself.  
When we stopped in Auschwitz they di
dn™t open up the door, we didn™t know 
where we were.  We  just saw a big si
gn that said, you know, a round sign.  It was 
like this, and it says ﬁArbeit macht das Le
ben sussﬂ, and that means in English, 
work ma kes life sweet.  So, but
 still the smell was terr ible, the smell was terrible 

and there was a big fire, like a big buildi
ng or some thing was on fire.  You could 
see far in from the tracks, but they didn™t open up the wagons until it got 

completely dark, I mean it was dark, dark.  All of a sudden floodlights came  on 

the train and we saw these SS there on
 the platform, you know, and dogs, dogs.  
And they opened up the doors and started 
screaming, ﬁHeraus! Heraus! He raus!ﬂ 
And, you know from tha t  trip a lot of pe
ople died because they threw in sick 
people and old people and so whoever coul
d run out from this train, they were 
going out.  If not you were beaten up.  So th
ey rushed so that they shouldn™t get 
beaten, but a lot of them that st ayed ther
e they just carried them out and put them 
on the truck.  There was a truck, a big ope
n truck, was right there, you know, not 
far from the platform.  Everybody tried taki
ng out the few things that they had for 
them, not that it was anything but, everybody 
is trying to survive, so they think 
they™ll be needing it. 

 
 So there was a ditch and they were yelling at the people they
 should throw away 
the luggage, and people didn™t want to part
 with it.  One was screaming ﬁI don™t 
have the name  on it!ﬂ  They were worryi
ng that they™ll neve
r find their luggage 

  
 
14
because they don™t have the name  on it.  So there was sort of a commotion, so 
they were hitting on the people and they got
 beaten up, they threw away those few 
little things that they had there.  But, 
with my grandfather he didn™t want it, he 
was getting beaten up, but he wouldn™t pa
rt with it.  And so, you know what they 
did to him.  Should I repeat, should I say it again? 
 

Q: You can, go ahead. 

 

A: The tape is on?   So he didn™t want to
 part with these Ten Commandme nt s, with 
this Torah.  So they were beating on hi
m.  We were pleading with him ﬁThrow it 
away! Throw it away!ﬂ  He didn™t wa nt to do 
it, so they beat him, they kicked him 
and then he could no longer get up.  He 
was there and then they were beating on 
us to go to the right, to the left.  And wh
at I reme mber seeing is that they just took 
my grandfather and they threw him on the truck because he couldn™t get up 

anymore and the Torah, the Ten Commandme
nt s were in the ditch.  And me  and 
my sister they put us to ride with my
 mother and my mother held on to my 
brother, she wouldn™t let go of hi m.  
 

Q: Now, this was your youngest brother? 

 

A: That was my youngest brother, he 
was six years younger than I was.  She 
wouldn™t let go of hi m, s o they started bea
ting on my brother so
 she let go.  But, 
she didn™t know that they™re going to put hi
m to the left , that they™re going to put 

him on the other side and my brother sc
reamed and cried and there were other 
cries from other children.  But, she sort
 of, she mu st have recognized his cry so 
she looked back and, you know, he was tryi
ng to go to my mother, so they were 
hitting on him and so my mother ran to hi
m from the right to the left and they 

wouldn™t let her go to the left.  So, they
 were beating on my mother, she fell and 
she was crawling and pleading with the SS,  
ﬁPlease let me go to my kid!  Please 
let me  go to my kid!ﬂ  So, finally after 
she was on the floor and pleading with him 
and, I don™t know, change of heart, he kick
ed her and she went to the left.  You 

know, he kicked her and she sort of moved 
to the left.  She ran to my brother and 
she got a hold of hi m, and, you know, my brother cried anyway because he saw 

my mother so beaten up.  And they wa
lked off, I™ll tell you the truth, you know, 

when I think if, sometimes, mo ments I said, 
I bet my mother would survive.  But, 
right after the war I knew she would have not
 survived anyway, so I say to myself 
ma ybe a good thing that happened, you know 
there were so ma ny kids they went 
to their death so frightened, so scared b
ecause they didn™t have
 their parents with 
them.  Now, the little infants, they di
dn™t know, but the four, five, six year old 
child, it was dark, it was dark.  In th
e beating, you know, they were hitting on 
children.  You would think they
 would leave children alone.
  If the child, let™s say 
didn™t obey what they said, 
if it wanted to go here or there they were they were 
hitting on kids like they h
it on adults.  And why they 
needed to do that I don™t 
understand, why they needed to hit on kids
.  And, so I say to myself, ma ybe she 
was a comfort to another child there, 
I™m sure.  You know, she had seven kids 
and, so ---- so that™s how my 
mother left to her death. 

  
 
15
 
Q: So when they split you to the right pe ople who ended up, at least at that point, 
surviving and the people who were on th
e left went to the gas chamber.? 
 

A: They went to the gas chamber right away. 

 

Q: Was your, did your grandmother also go to the left? 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: She went to the left  al so? 

 

A: Oh, yes.  You know the parting was difficult, you know time s  were terrible, but 
we were toge ther, you know.  If you tried 
to separate families it™s just  --- I can™t 
tell you how painful.  The price they had 
to pay while they were separating them, 
you know, beside the physical pain, 
the emotional pain was horrible. 
 

Q: Do you remember, you said you and your sist
er were on the right. 
 Did your father 
also go to the right?   Wa s he on the right? 
 

A: The me n were separated separately. 

 

Q: So it was men and then wome n, and then
 divided again between left and right. 
 

A: Left and right.  So that was the end. 

 
Q: So that was the last time  you saw your father. 
 

A: When they opened the trains.  It was so
 chaotic, you know, they let the dogs bite, 
jump on you, you know, you™re scared.  I 
can™t tell you, it was like hell on earth. 
 

Q: Okay, why don™t I ask you some  que stions
 about your parents before the war and 
a couple of things about their parents and th
ings like that.  C
ould you just tell me  
their name s, and the same  thing for your grandmother, when they were born and 

where they were born and that 
kind of thing if you reme mbe r . 
 

A: Okay, my mother™s name was Rose, I 
mean her ma iden na me was Moscowitz, but 
then when she was ma rried to my father it was Leibowitz. 
 

Q: Do you remember when she was born? 

 

A: No, but she was, in this picture she was in
 the late thirties, early forties, when we 
were taken to Auschwitz. 
 

Q: And she was, your mother was born in Volosyanka? 

 

  
 
16
A: Yes. 
 

Q: But your father was born some where else? 

 

A: In Nod Berezna, another town. 

 

Q: You spelled that for me . 

 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: Can you give me  your fa ther™s name? 

 

A: Martin. 

 

Q: MartinLeibowitz? 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: Do you remember how old he wa

A: I know that he was six y
ears older than my mother, 
but I don™t know exactly the 
dates.  He must have been in the late, sort of --- 
 

Q: Mid-forties? 

 

A: Mid-forties,yes. 
 
Q: Okay, do you reme mber when they got ma rried?   You don™t reme mberﬂ 

 

A: No. 

 

Q: Let™s see, you said ther
e were seven kids in all. 

 

A: Sevenkids. 

 

Q: Do you remember how ma ny, 
there were how many girls? 
 

A: Three brothers and four 
girls, including me .  There we
re three sisters, but I was 
the fourth girl. 
 

Q: Okay, four girls and three boys
.  Can you give me their name s? 
 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: The four girls, including yourse
lf.  So we have Helen and --- 
 

  
 
17
A: Shall I give you from the oldest down? 
 

Q: Sure. 

 

A: Well, Larry, shall I call him what we called him? 

 

Q: Sure, tell me  both, you can give me  
his real given name  and then --- 
 

A: We called him Lib, and then he, I name d my son after him as Larry. 

 

Q: Okay, so Lib would be L-I-B. 

 

A: Yes,B. 

 

Q: And he was the oldest. 

 

A: He was the oldest.  Actually, wait a mi
nute, I had a sister, she was the oldest, but 
she came to the United St ates so she di
dn™t go through the con
centration camps. 
 

Q: So she came before the war started? 

 

A: Before, in ™39, would you believe it
?  Just before the whole disaster. 
 

Q: What was her name? 

 

A: Her name  was here, we called her Lya  
(side B, tape 1), but Fr ances they called 
her in the United States.  Frances. 
 

Q: So you were in contact with her after you got her? 

 

A: It™s another story. 

 

Q: Okay. 

 

A: That™s why it™s good you ask questions 
because I can sit here for half an hour 
telling you how we got in contact. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: And then, I had a sister, her na
me , uh, my God.  Her name  was Sura. 

 

Q: Sura?   S-U-R-A? 

 

A: Yes.  And she had a child, and, you know, itwas at night so she just walked away 
with the child.  Some  children were to
rn, you know mothers were torn away --- 
 

  
 
18
Q: You mean when you came to Auschwitz? 
 

A: And probably she was the lucky one.  
She just walked off with the kid. 
 

Q: She had the kid with her? 

 

A: She had the kid with her.  And then my br
other, my brother, this is my brother.  
His name  was Saul. 
 

Q: Saul?   Did he have a nickname  or did you call him just Saul? 

 

A: No, his name ---Shl omo actually we called 
him, in Jewish,.  And then this is my 
sister that I live through my
 life during the war.  Her name  is Sylvia, we called her 
Zeisl. 
 

Q: How would you spell that? 

 

A: Spell it?  Zeisl. 

 

Q: I would say Z-E-I-S-L. 

 

A: Yeah.  In Jewish we would call it shorter.  And right now her name  is Sylvia, and 
then it™s me . 
 

Q: So it was Helen, Sura and Sylvia and then the ol de st was Frances? 

 
A: Yes. 
 

Q: And then you had, we™ve got Larry and 
Saul and what was your other brother™s 
name ?  
 

A: Efraim.  

 

Q: Efraim.  Okay, now you said your
 parents had a shoe store? 
 

A: Yes, it was like, it was like a franchise,
 there were lots of places.  That wa s only 
by the Czechs, and then the Jews were
n™t allowed to have no franchise. 
 

Q: Did he, was he like, did he repair 
shoes, or did they just sell them?  

 

A: They just sold them, you know there wa
s a factory that supplied these batya 
stores.  Li ke Hahn™s.  
 

Q: Sure. 

 

A: But it wasn™t that big, you know everything was smaller there. 

  
 
19
 
Q: Were there, I didn™t ask you this before
, were there like Je
wish youth groups, or 
kind of community groups in the town, or
 was it just pe ople saw each other at the 
synagogue and that kind of thing? 
 

A: The synagogue and then, you know, we had to make our own schools.  So we saw 
each other in the schools. 
 

Q: Did you, your brothers and sisters, go to
 private Jewish scho
ols or did you go to 
public schools or --- 
 

A: by the Czechs we went to public school. 

 

Q: But under the Hungarians you went to --- 

 

A: Private, because we weren™t allowed 
no more to go to school.  And the schools 
were held at home , it wasn™t a private 
building.  It wasn™t a building where the 
kids could go to, it wa
s in different home s. 
 

Q: Did your, you said father was in about 
his mi d-forties in 1940, did he, was he 
involved in World Wa r I or a
nything?   Wa s he a veteran? 
 

A: Yes, believe it or not that™s why he didn™t understand. 

 

Q: He didn™t understand why the Germans 
were treating people the way they did? 
 
A: Well, he kept on saying he f
ought for the Hungarians actually. 
 
Q: theAustrian-Hungarians? 

 

A: The Austrian-Hungarians.  That
™s why he thought he was safe. 
 

\Q: He thought the Germans were --- 

 

A: Yeah, that they™ll recognize that even
 he™s a Jew but he served his country. 

 

Q: He fought on their side. 

 

A: Yeah, he served for the country he lived for,  he lived there.  Matter of fact he was 
wounded. 
 

Q: Uh,huh. 

 

A: Right here.  You know, a 
bullet went through his leg. 
 

Q: So he fought against the Russians? 

  
 
20
 
A: In Austria, I was a little 
kid so I don™t really reme mber 
but I know that he was in a 
war. 
 

Q: Did he used to tell stories to like you
r brothers and sisters about the war and 
things like that? 
 

A: Yes, war, yes he did.  Yes. 

 

Q: So he believed the Germans were just, 
they couldn™t do the things that people 
were saying?   Did he believ
e that the Germans were --- 
 

A: You know, we believed ma ybe it would 
happen to one, to two, ma ybe a German 
that isn™t educated.  We  di
dn™t think it would be an or
ganized situation.  You see 
what I™m saying? 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: How can, how can a country or whatever
 organize to eliminate a people?  You 
know, we thought it would be like, one person that will vandalize us or, you 

know. 
 

Q: Were your parents 
fairly well educated? 
 

A: Well, they were educated in Jewish, very much so. 

 
Q: Did they go through school? 
 

A: You know, I™m Jewish but I™m not that relig
ious, I have difficulties today.  I have 
diffi culties today.  I™m afraid to think th
at there is nothing because it can be 
worse, but ---I don™t think I am as religious as my people.  My parents, my 

grandparents, they definitely believed, they were definite believers.  To them, a 

sin was ma ybe doubting God.  I mean --- 
 

Q: Did your parents, do you reme mber if they
 went to public schools or did they go 
to Jewish schools? 
 

A: I don™t know, but I know they were well 
educated in Jewish.  They would quote 
things from the Bible, ma ybe that was 
their way of educating us to be huma n 
beings.  I™m not sure why they did that, 
but uh, if there was an
y correction in our 
behavior, you know kids act up some times, so they would quote us from the Bible 

what is right and what is wrong.  The 
Bible says this, the Bible says that. 
 

Q: Now you said when the Hungarians came in
 they seized the shoe store, they 
seized the store and these things.  Did 
your parents, can you tell me  a little bit 

  
 
21
about your house and where you grew up a
nd that kind of, like ma ybe how much 
land you had, where it was, was it a wooded area or --- 
 
A: We had a house and we had also --- 

 

Q: Was it also a stone house like your grandparents? 

 

A: No, no.  It was a stucco house. 

 

Q: uh,huh. 

 

A: Oy, if I would go back there I bet I woul
d recognize it because I rememb er it so 
vividly. 
 

Q: Have you been back? 

 

A: They wouldn™t, I went back to see my 
brother in Russia because he was, I was in 
Bergen Belsen when the English --- 
 

Q: When they liberated you? 

 

A: They liberated me .  In Russia, when 
my brother was liberated he was liberated 
under the Russians and then he could no longer leave. 
 

Q: Does he still live in Czechoslovakia? 

 
A: No we brought him over here, well he wa
s in Russia for ma ny years, but then we 
brought him over here and he died. 
 
Q: Not long ago? 

 

A: About three years ago. 

 

Q: So, let™s see, you said
 you had a stucco house. 
 

A: Yes, and we had cows and, you know, sheep and we had a different house for the 
animals. 
 

Q: Like a barn? 

 

A: Like a barn, yeah.  And we had some
, near the house, we had some . You know 
under the Czechs, the reason why my  gra
ndparents had more cows and all kinds 
of animals because they had land, they ha
d, we were allowed to own land by the 

Czechs.  Wh en the Hungarians come 
nothing was ours, you know what I™m 

saying?   They took it away. 
 

  
 
22
Q: Did you all have chores that you 
had to do, like to milk the cows? 
 
A: Oh, yeah, yeah. 

 

Q: What did you do, do you reme mber? 

 

A: Well, I used to like to pl
ay with the little calves.  They were my favorite.  Oh, I 
loved them. 
 

Q: Did you all have pets
, like a dog or a cat? 
 

A: Yeah, yeah.  The kids loved it.  You 
know we we re so ma ny children, so that was 
our life sort of, to uh --- 
 

Q: Did you live right in the town or 
did you live like on the outside of town? 
 

A: No, in the town. 

 

Q: Inthetown? 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: Now you said your grandparents had th
eir store, wa s connected to the house. 
 

A: Yes. 

 
Q: Was that also the same  way in the shoe store? 
 

A: No, the shoe store was in
 a different building because 
it was a franchise sort of. 
 

Q: Did ma ny people in the town speak Germ
an, did they know German or no, just 
Czech? 
 

A: Yiddish, Czech and Yiddish. 

 

Q: CzechandYiddish? 

 

A: Yes.  From what I reme mber, because mo
st of my life, most 
life in Europe I was 
under Czech.  Under the Hungarians it was onl
y three or four years so, then I was 
so, I didn™t see much of t he outside  world. 
 So, to me  the Czech life was more so -
-- 
 

Q: Do you remember what your parents 
mi ght have said, or do you reme mbe r  
anything they ma y have thought about the 
Hungarians when they came in?   We re 
they frightened or were they apprehensive? 
 

  
 
23
A: They were apprehensive, they were appr
ehensive that we weren™t allowed, I me an 
we were a second class citizen, you know. 
 We were limited, we were even 
limited to worship, I mean that doesn™t 
hurt anyone.  What can a person do with 
worship in God?   I mean, we prayed for better time s.  And t hen, you know, we 
were preoccupied with how to survive, how
 to feed all these mouths.  That was 

our preoccupation and our safety. 
 

Q: When the Hungarians seized the store, your
 store, what did your parents do to try 
and ma ke a living then? 
 

A: It was really very difficult.  We  had to
 live off, again like my grandparents, we 
had a little pl ace near the house that we
 planted carrots and potatoes and you 
know, just barely.  And then we had our 
cows, so we had our cows for milk.  
People there lived mostly on potatoes a
nd milk and bread, oh bread was a big 

thing.  And we had poultry, we had --- 
 

Q: Chickens and things? 

 

A: Chickens and goose, white goose I reme mber. 

 

Q: But they couldn™t have, your father 
couldn™t have a job 
after the Hungarians 
came. 
 

A: Oh,no. 

 

Q: Not in a regular job sense. 
 
A: No, he had, you know, odd jobs here and there.  I think my fa ther was mo re 
educated, I think he had, you know, because
 he --- I think my mother was less 
educated, but she was educated in the To
rah, she was educated in Jewish.  She 

went to a cheder  (side B, tape 1).  Bu t, I think that my father did go to some  

school because I think he wa
s an officer in the --- 
 

Q: In the army?  

 

A: In the army, yeah. 

 

Q: Did you all have a radio at home? 

 

A: We had, but the Hungarians you had to hand them in. 

 

Q: They took it? 

 

A: You had to hand them in. 

 

Q: So you had to bring them in? 

  
 
24
 
A: We were scared that they™ll 
find us, you know, where can you --- 
 

Q: Did your parents also read a news
paper in the town before the war? 
 

A: Yes, there wa s newspaper, but not af
ter the Hungarians, there wasn™t no --- 
 

Q: Was the newspaper from the town or from a larger town elsewhere? 

 

A: It was brought in from the larger 
town, you know like the New York Ti mes, you 
could find a New York Time s in Wa s hi
ngton.  There was no place where they 
made it. 
 

Q: So your parents knew about things that were going on in Germany and Poland or 
that kind of thing. 
 

A: More or less, when Hitler, we knew 
when the German, uh, what was his name , 
uh, when Hitler became, got the power, the leader, we knew.  We  knew. 
 

Q: In 1933, yeah. 

 

A: We  knew when Hitler got to power. 

 

Q: Was there ever any, when the Hungarian
s come  in, was there ever any discussion 
in your fami ly about possibly leaving at all?   There was? 
 
A: We wanted to come  to the United States, but, you know, because I had my sister 
here.  But, we couldn™t no 
longer.  Now where could 
we have gone?   We were 
surrounded, in Hungary the Jews were trea
ted like we were treated, in Roma nia, 
Jews were treated like we  were treated. 
 If you see Czechoslovakia in the mi ddle -
-- 
 
Q: No place to go? 

 

A: No place to go.  There was no place to go. 

 

Q: Okay, now let™s see, we talked about 
your father and your mo ther and how, what 
happened to them once they went to Ausc
hwitz and they were with you the whole 
time when we talked about you going from
 the ghetto in Uhzgorod and then on to 
Auschwitz`.  So, I basically know their 
story, you™ve told me  that.  And your 
father, you said, you were split so the la
st time you saw your father was when you 
came off the train, but you don™t know what happened to him at all, okay. 
 

A: But my brother, my brother, told us wh
en he came  that he me t up with a ma n that 
was with my  older brother and my older brother ---  
 

  
 
25
Q: Now this was Saul, your brot
her that you were talking about? 
 
A: Yeah.  Now, I™m going to talk about Larr
y, that he actually survived all this time, 
but when they were taking him b
ack as the Russian or the --- 
 

Q: After the war, you mean? 

 

A: No, that was almost the end of the war,
 he died of starvati on in a train because 
they were taking him away.  You see, wh
at they were doing is that they we re 
picking, you know you have these gren
ades on the floor, let™s say, you know 
when the Russians retreated, when the Germans, before the Ge rmans would ma ke 

any steps they would se
nd out these Jewish boys to the mi ne fields. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: So they would pick up, you know.  So th
at™s what happened.  He survived that. 
 

Q: He went through, he was actually in
 one of those, your father was? 

 

A: No, my brother.  But, what happened wa
s he died of starvation because when they 
had to retreat, they were retreating and ta
king these, whoever was left, a handful.  
They weren™t giving them to eat or anythi
ng or sleep, so he just ---That™s what 
somebody t old my --- 
 

Q: Told Saul about Larry? 

 
A: Yes.  But, you know, could he have su
rvived ma ybe the starvation he would be 
alive because he survived --- 
 
Q: He got through the camps. 

 

A: Yes.  But, you know, I wasn™t there. 

 

Q: Sure, I understand.  But the last time
 you heard anything about your father was 
when you got off the train? 
 

A: That was it. 

 

Q: Why don™t you tell me  a bout, well, we can 
start with Saul since he survived.  Do 
you reme mb er, let me .  Saul Leibowitz 
was his name.  Do you reme mber his 
birthday?  
 

A: Uh, I should, I thi
nk he was born in ™23. 
 

Q: Uh, uh.  So he was about fi
ve years older than you were? 

 

  
 
26
A: Yes. 
 

Q: Do you remember what month and day 
he was born?   Do you reme mber when 
you used to celebrate his birthday? 
 

A: Uh, I don™t know exactly and I don™t 
want to tell you when I™m not sure. 
 

Q: Do you remember if it was in
 the fall or the spring or --- 
 

A: I can find out. 

 

Q: Okay.  If you have a record of it some where you can call me and tell me. 

 

A: All right, all right, I™ll do that. 

 

Q: Let™s see, so basically, did your brot
her go to public school under the Czechs? 
 

A: Under the Czechs, yes. 

 

Q: Is there anything special about your br
other™s childhood that 
was ma ybe different 
from yours, that ma ybe stands out in your mi nd? 
 

A: Well, he had more resp
onsibilities than I did. 
 

Q: What kinds of things? 

 
A: Well, let me tell you, he helped my fath
er with small little jobs like, let™s say, a 
non-Jew, it was forbidden for a non-Jew 
to ---by the Hungarians they were 
allowed, by the Hungarians the Jews coul
dn™t own anything.  But the Jews were 
allowed to work for the non-Jews sort of.  So he used to --- 
 
Q: And this is under the Hungarians? 

 

A: Yes, we are talking now about the H
ungarians.  So he would go and help my 
father to --- 
 

Q: Oh, so you did, you me ntioned some thi
ng about after the Hungarians came your 
father worked to try to help support. 
 

A: Littlejobs. 

 

Q: Odd jobs or some thing? 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: And so your brother helped him?  

  
 
27
 
A: Right,right. 

 

Q: Did he also have more re
sponsibility on the farm, did he deal with the cows or the 
sheep? 
 

A: Well, I™ll tell you under the Czechs we had a bigger farm, but under the 
Hungarians we no longer had the farm, except they let us have a few cows and a 

few chickens.  But, as I said, even unde
r the Hungarians they were taking from 
the non-Jews too, but the non-Jews, the gr
ounds still belonged to them.  You see 
what I™m saying?   They took the livesto
ck.  But the ground, they could own the 
ground, but we no longer owned the ground. 
 

Q: Okay, had your brother completed school
, had he finished the public school 
before the wa r started, or before 1939 when the Hungarians came  in?  
 

A: You know what, we can figure that out. 

 

Q: How long did people go to school
, when did they start school? 
 

A: He went to high school. 

 

Q: He did go to high school? 

 

A: My oldest brother finished high school. 

 
Q: Larrydid? 
 

A: Larry did, I don™t know if
 he fully did finish. 
 

Q: Do you remember what age they would have finished high school? 

 

A: Well we started at six. 

 

Q: Atsix? 

 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: And how many grades we
re there, do you reme mber? 
 

A: Likehere. 

 

Q: So it would be about the twelfth? 

 

A: Yes, it was like here. 

 

  
 
28
Q: So, let™s see, in 1939 Saul would have b
een about sixteen, so he would have been 
close. 
 
A: Yeah. 

 

Q: Did he, so I guess he never had a job, 
like a real job before
 the Hungarians came. 
 

A: No. 

 

Q: Saul I™m talking about. 

 

A: No, he just helped my fat her, you know. 

 

Q: Was he involved in any activities in th
e town, like a sporting club or some thing? 
 

A: No, there wasn™t such a thing. 

 

Q: There wasn™t any clubs?  

 

A: No. 

 

Q: What did he do for a musement, do you re
me mbe r  what he liked to do?   Did he 
like to fi sh or  did he like to --- 
 

A: You know, it is so difficult to explain a 
child™s life then and a child™s life here, 
when I see my grandchildren, ma y God keep them well.  Um, it™s just like, 
children were  just not childre n, childr en we
re like old people.  What they worried 
about is how to survive, how to see the sadness.  Let me  say this, by the Czechs it 
wasn™t so visible, but as soon as th
e Hungarians came in, the children were no 
longer children. 
 

Q: They grew up fast. 

 

A: They grew up fast, they grew up fast. 

 

Q: Did he like to do, did he have
 any hobbies when he was younger? 
 

A: Well, he liked reading. 

 

Q: He liked to read? 

 

A: Oh, he loved reading, he loved r
eading.  Any book that you know, books were 
scarce.  I know that, you know, a Torah is
 a holy thing, but you wouldn™t believe 
that a book to us was a holy thing.  Any book that you got a hold of, I remember 

we had a breakfront, what do you think wa
s in that breakfront, a book that we got 

a hold of.  It was, everybody read it, and we
 read it.  We  used to dust the book, the 

  
 
29
dust shouldn™t fall on it.  That™s how scar
ce a book was.  So I tell you when I 
came here to this country and I had my 
children, I kept on telling them how, you 
know, privileged.  My children knew when they go to school they are privileged 
to be able to go to school.  They are pr
ivileged to have an access of books that 

they could have. 
 

Q: Could use, yeah. 

 

A: You know, it™s like, to us books were 
like jewels.  Yeah, that was a good word, 
like jewels. 
 

Q: So he like to read a lot? 

 

A: Oh, we all, in that respect, because ther
e wasn™t that much that kids could do.  So, 
what do you get?   You know, so when you read a book your mi nd was 

preoccupied.  Your mi nd was occupied. 
 

Q: You could get away. 

 

A: From your s a dness, from your uh --- 

 

Q: Before the war, before the Hungarians 
came, did you all like to do things, in the 
outdoors, did you play a lot or
 did you go fishing or --- 
 

A: Well, we played like kids play.  Y
ou know, we hop scotched I reme mber, and I 
played with non-Jewish child
ren hopscotch, I reme mber. 
 

Q: Did your brother, did he have some , a 
lot of, non-Jewish friends, or did he have 
mostly Jewish friends? 
 

A: Well, when we went to school by the 
Czechs we had non-Jewi sh, we thought they 
were our friends.  You know like kids
, you don™t think which synagogue, which 
house of worship you go.  Kids don™t 
think like that, so who cares? 
 

Q: Okay, when you were deported to th
e ghetto, okay, you said some thing about 
your brother being taken away for work. 
 

A: That was before the ghetto. 

 

Q: Okay, can you tell me  a little bit 
about that, what he was doing, do you 
r e me mb e r ?  
 

A: That was another thing, you know.  My 
mother, they took them a way and we 
didn™t get mail from them, the ma il wasn™t comi ng.  So, I reme mber, in the 

beginning, the ma il would come , ma ybe, 
very, the beginning we would get a 

  
 
30
postcard from them.  So, my mother, we di
dn™t have much, so my mother used to 
bake cookies and send them little packages, you know of cookies. 
 
Q: And this was under the Hungarians, 
that you said the ma il wasn™t comi ng. 
 

A: Right.  But occasiona lly we did get, in the begi nning.  So then the ma il stopped, 
so I reme mb er how she carried on.  She 
felt that they are not alive anymore 
because we weren™t ge tting any ma il.  S
o, my mo ther was preoccupied with that, 
that they took away her sons and, you know
, that they™re not alive.  There was no 

way to find out where they were. 
 

Q: So both Larry and Saul 
were taken away to work? 
 

A: Yes,yes. 

 

Q: Was your father also
 taken away or no? 
 

A: He was taken away to work in town, but
 he could sleep at home .  You see what I 
mean?   But the boys left and we didn™t, you know, we didn™t see them again. 
 

Q: So they were in the work camps and when you were deported they didn™t come  
with you, they stayed in the camps or whatever. 
 

A: Well, wherever they were, yeah. 

 

Q: Did you know because of the little bi
t of ma il that came where they were? 
 

A: Golly, I don™t reme mber .  That was just
 at the beginning, you know, just as a child 
I reme mber my mother was excited baking cookies to send to them and then she 

was sad because she could no longer send th
em cookies and being that they don™t 
write, they™re not alive anymore, so she was mour ning.  You know, I reme mber 

her cryi ng over that, that her boys are probably not alive anymore because we 

didn™t get the mail. 
 

Q: When were they taken away to go to the work camps, do you reme mber? 

 

A: that was after the Hungarians came. 

 

Q: So, it would have been in 1939? 

 

A: Well, maybe a little while later. 

 

Q: Maybe1940? 

 

A: Some thing like it, yes.  I was a littl
e kid so I don™t reme mber the exact time. 
 

  
 
31
Q: And you said that Saul survived. 
 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: Did he tell you where he had gone, what happened to him?  

 

A: Yes, he worked in different places, in
 different pl aces under the Germans.  Then, 
the Germans took over these Jewish --- 
 

QW:  Was he in Hungary still or, I m
ean in Czechoslova kia still or --- 
 

A: No, he was in Poland and in Russia and 
all over the place, all over the pl ace. 
 

Q: Was he also in any concentration camps? 

 

A: He wasn™t in Auschwitz, he was only in
 the work camps and they got liberated by 
the Russians, ma rching, 
 

Q: Do you know where they were ma rching, do you reme mber, did he tell you?   Wa s 
it a death march? 
 

A: Well, sort of.  Yeah, they were ma rching them and then one night the Russians 
just showed up, yes. 
 

Q: So this was in 1944 ma ybe, or 1945? 

 
A: The dates I™ve got a problem.  Let me
 tell you how he survived.  What happened 
was when the Germans were ma rching th
ese guys, at one time they rested up 
some place.  You know, it was a place, I don™t know what, a farm.  He called it, 
let™s say a farm.  So he s neaked away and went in under the hay, you know he 

covered himself up with hay 
until the next day the Germans left with the group, 
but he had a problem, he had a problem when the Russians came , he had a  

problem to explain hims elf, where is he
 comi ng from, where has he been?  So, 
you know, when he would tell me  these stor
ies I, myself, couldn™t believe what 
this guy had to go through just, even, af
ter the wa r, how the Russians kept him 

locked up.  But then he was telling th
e story how, you know, so finally they 
caught up with the group, so they knew that he must be telling the truth because 

he knew about the group and it was lucky th
at they caught up with them a short 
time later so they told him to let him go because, who knows, they could have 

thought he was a spy and they
 could have killed him.  
 

Q: Right,sure. 

 

A: So that was the lucky part, so even if 
he wanted to survive he could have gotten 
killed after, after war for different reasons. 
 

  
 
32
Q: So he survived and then he 
was kept in Russia after the war? 
 
A: Yes. 

 

Q: Do you know where in Russia he was? 

 

A: Well, the last place he lived was Uhzgorod. 

 

Q: Oh, so that was in the pa rt of C
zechoslovakia that turned into Ukraine. 

 

A: To the Ukraine, and the Russians occupied it. 

 

Q: So he lived there and then he came to the U.S. 

 

A: Yes, I can call you up and tell you exactly when he came because we brought him 
out. 
 

Q: Okay. 

 

A: And did we have a time , also. 

 

Q: Wa s this in the seve
nties or the eighties? 
 

A: Seventies, I think it wa
s the seventies when we brought
 him over.  I™ll tell you the 
exact dates because we have the papers
.  That I can give you the exact date. 
 
Q: Okay, that™s good.  Why don™t you tell me  
the name  of your sister, who was Sura, 
or is that Sylvia? 
 
A: Sylvia. 

 

Q: Sylvia™s in the pictur e? 

 

A: Sura never went to that accident ally
, you know, you see what the Germans did in 
the beginning they just gassed everybody th
at came to Auschwitz.  But, when we 
came at that time the German munitions f
actory already said 
don™t kill them all 
out, send me  the ma npower.  That™s where 
I worked the munitions factory.  But, 
so that™s how I survived.  But, my sist
er, they probably would have grabbed the 
kid out of her hand but she was short 
and skinny, sort of, so you know, they 
weren™t paying much attention to her.  So she got away walking to the gas 

chambers with her child.  I mean, it 
was like, you know, a freak accident.  
Probably would have been worse for her if
 they would have taken the kids out 
because her kid was really small. 
 

Q: Sure. 

 

  
 
33
A: Who knows what was worse, who knows? 
 

Q: Okay, do you reme mber when Sylvia 
was born, what year she was born in? 
 

A: Yea,1925. 

 

Q: Do you remember her birthday? 

 

A: February the tenth. 

 

Q: February the tenth? 

 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: She was closer in age to you. 

 

A: Yes, I was born in ™28. 

 

Q: And, let™s see. Did she, was she also 
in public school there, under the Czechs? 
 

A: Yes, but, you know she didn™t finish.  But 
you™d be surprised, we tried so hard to 
study even in our own little privat
e cheders, what we called them. 
 

Q: Yeah. 

 

A: And that was our outlet, you were as
king me  whether we had ---this was our 
outlet, to get a pencil and paper and wr
ite or, you know, number work.  I used to 
love number work, actually I loved it.  
A piece of paper was di fficult, so it was 
difficult all around.  My kids grew up th
at they were privileged, they had enough 
paper and pencil.  I didn™t te
ll them the rest of the horro
r stories, but I just ma de 
them --- I really st ill feel th
at a child that is, that  has 
the privilege of an education 
and doesn™t take, that doesn™t say, you 
know, my daughter went
 to college, my 
first daughter went to college, I said 
to her, you know, you are privileged to be 
able to go to college.  A
nd I really think she was th
ere and she felt, you know, 
some thing terrific is happening to her.
  I really think she felt like that . 
 

Q: Do you remember, let™s see, you said becau
se your brother was older that he had 
some  more responsibility in your family. 
 Did your sister also since she was a 
little bit ol der than you? 
 

A: Yes, we would go and wa
sh floors for other people and clean.  I mean, because 
there were a few doctors there. 
 

Q: Now was this under the Hungari
ans or was this under the --- 
 

  
 
34
A: Under the Hungarians, not the Czechs.  
The Hungarians, a matter of fact, should I 
tell you, I reme mber even me , I used 
to go and help out, you know.  We  were 
glad, because what happened was when I went to help out, to do these chores, you 
know some body gave me  a slice of br
ead.  You know, I don™t know, I also felt 
good that they asked you to come .  Actu
ally, you felt good that they asked you to 
come  in to their house to help them out with these chores. 
 

Q: It was probably nice to be aw
ay from the house some times, too. 
 

A: It was, it was ---well, I can™t say it wa
s nice because I had to wash the bathrooms, 
I had to wash the clothes and, you know, I 
was a little kid.  I wasn™t that old, 
ma ybe 12 or  13 years old when I was doing it.  But, it was okay, because that™s 

how we were surviving, you know what I™m saying? 
 

Q: Sure. 

 

A: And they weren™t beating on us. 

 

Q: Right.  Did you, I mean you and your sister
, since you were closer, did you play a 
lot together? 
 

A: Yes, we fought a lot and we played a lot.
  Yes, but we were very close.  Matter of 
fact, I think you™re going to hear in th
e tape that, probably if not for her, I 
probably would not have survived.  I™ll 
tell you why -- because I™m not that strong 
willed and I, oh I know, many ti mes I just di
dn™t want to, like when I was in the 
munitions factory, I was tired and I wa s hungr
y and I was, I was half dead.  So, I 
didn™t want to get up in the morning and 
these people, that they didn™t get up in 
the morning, they were left in the ba
rracks when we worked.  You never saw 
them again, they probably, you know, we just never ---nobody asked.  We  never 

saw them again.  They probably just did aw
ay with them.  So, I would want to do 
that and she would lift me up and she s
hook me  i n the morning.  She dragged me  
out, but it was cold, you see where we  we
re in Germany it was very cold and, 

here, you know, we had these wooden shoe
s and the one dress.  So, she would 
drag me  out to stay there for an 
hour, you know, and she would encourage me , 
she would give me , you know half a slice of
 her half slice of
 bread so that I 
should just go on, go on.  She would do a lot of work for me  t hat, you know, I 

could not work so hard, she just --- Bu
t, in the end, I reme mber in the end, you 
know, she said she™s not going to leave me  here alone.  She would get angry at 

me , she would get angr y at me  because I say, ﬁI™m going to dieﬂ.  You know, to 

her it was a threat.  To me  it was real, me
ntally, with me In think my mental stage 

gave up so ---you know, I don™t care anym
ore, so if not for her I probably 
wouldn™t be sitting 
here and talking. 
 

Q: On the tape, do you talk about her quite
 a bit and where you went, did you always 
stay together through the camps? 
 

  
 
35
A: Yes,yes. 
 

Q: Did she also survive?  

 

A: Yes, yes.  In the end, I don™t know if I put
 that on the tape.  When they brought us 
to Bergen Be lsen, she wa s the first one to get sick because when we got to Bergen 

Belsen was when (tape ended) 
 

 (Beginning of tape 2) Le t me  ask you a
bout your smallest brother, about your 
youngest brother.  Now, let™s see you said your, that was Efram, Efra m?  
 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: Do you remember when he was born? 

 

A: Well, ma tter of fact, I do reme mber when
 he was born, I was a little girl myself.  
But, it was like, we were already six, but th
ere was sort of an exciteme nt when he 
was born.  You know, being that he was the 
youngest, all the kids sort of felt that 
he was their little toy. 
 

Q: Right, he was the little baby, yeah. 

 

A: So everybody was involved with him, you know. 

 

Q: So, now you said he wa
s born six years after you. 
 
A: Afterme . 
 

Q: So that would have been about 1934? 

 

A: Yeah, right.  No, ™36, wait 
a mi nute, I was born in ™28. 

 

Q: So six years later would have been ™3
4.  If you were born in
 ™28, six years would 
have been ™34 because --- 
 

A: Okay,okay. 

 

Q: Do you remember his birthday? 

 

A: No,no, 

 

Q: no, okay.  Had he started school
 yet in 1939?   Probably not. 
 

A: No, because we were under the Hungarians, you know, he used to come  into the 
cheder and just, some times, annoy, they w
ould throw hi m out of the room.  But, 

  
 
36
you know, most of the time  they would keep him there.  Some ti me s he would be 
good and some ti me s, you know. 
 

Q: Was he mi schievous as a little boy? 

 

A: He was a little, yeah, he was a spoiled 
little ki d because the ki d it wasn™t so much 
that my mot her and father had that mu
ch time for him, but, you know, he was like 

the kid™s toy.  He was a loving little
 kid, so everybody picked him up and hugged 
him and I think that™s what ma de him so  loving because he ha d so ma ny people. 
 

Q: Did he have any special 
chores when he was younger, did he have to do things 
before the farm was take
n away, or the livestock? 
 

A: I don™t remember the specif
ics that they would give 
him some thing to do.  I don™t 
r e me mb e r .  
 

Q: Were there game s he liked to play with you guys? 

 

A: Yeah, yeah.  Hide and seek, you know, 
yeah.  He would like to hide and we 
would have to run after him, you know 
and find him.  You know, like a child. 
 

Q: did he like to read too? 

 

A: oh, he just had an aleph-beis book.  I 
reme mber it, and I™m telling you he would 
carry this book along and he wouldn™t s
how just anybody, he had to be your 
friend in order for him to show you that book. 
 

Q: What kind of book was it? 

 

A: Aleph-beis, it was like an A-B-C book, in
 Yiddish they called it an aleph-beis 
book, he called it the aleph-beis boo
k, but it was the A-B-C book, A-B-C book, 
and he loved that book, he loved it, he carried
 it, he went to sleep with it, like who 
knows what.  But, you know to get to a book like that wasn™t so ea
sy either in the 
war, so it™s ---so, it wasn™t like this book could be  replaced so easily.  You know, 

for my children™s birthdays and my gra
ndchildren™s birthdays I always, well for 
my children™s birthdays it was a trend, 
it was always a book.  But even for my 
grandchildren™s birthdays when they were
 little I always went and bought a few 
little books and send it to them for presen
ts, I don™t know why, but this was, they 
knew when their bi rthday would come , they™ll ge t books from me , little books. 
 

Q: Books are a good thing to give, they ma ke you s mart. 

 

A: Well, I mean, you see, an American ch
ild does not understand that a European 
child, even a non-Jewish child was not that 
lucky to get this education.  A lot of 
people don™t, it was when I was raised, when I was raised, maybe now it™s 

different.  Probably it™s differe
nt, here it™s different too. 
 But, when I was raised a 

  
 
37
book was, or an education was scarce.  
People didn™t have the money, and didn™t 
have the means. 
 
Q: Did your parents teach you, you said they 
were very educated in Jewish history 
and things like that, di d they teach that to you? 
 

A: They did, and they also used it.  If I 
think back, like let™s say I did some thing that 
they didn™t like, they would bring out 
a quote from the Bible, what™s wrong and 
what™s right.  Like they
 would tell me, you know, they would say God gave you 
that you can choose from right and 
wrong, now, do you think God would be 
happier with you if you choose the right 
or the wrong?   They
 didn™t understand 
that me  as a child could not, ma ny times, understand what I™m doing wrong.  And 

it™s not that I did such 
terrible wrong, you know, ma ybe I didn™t like some thing 
that they told me  to do and I didn™t wa
nt to do it, you know ---so, what I™m trying 
to say is that they used their educatio
n sort of raising us.  There was never 
physical, I don™t ever reme mber, even when
 we were seven kids, there was never
