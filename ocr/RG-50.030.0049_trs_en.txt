Q: We'r e on.  Tape is rolling.  Please tell us your name. 
 
A: My name  is Ion Butnaru. 
 
Q: When and where you have been born?  
 
A: I am born in Hu_i, a small city from Moldavia.  At...December 4th, 1980...1918. 
 
Q: Please tell us about your family, about
 growing up in Hu_i before the war. 
 
A: My family is from Hu_i.  My grandfather wa
s born in Hu_i, my father
 born in Hu_i.  What I 
can tell you?   They make a living being vineyards [
NB:
 vintners].  They plant their 
vineyards.  They harvest the vineyards. 
 They sell the wine.  They are very good 
winema kers.  As a ma tter of fact, a
ll my young...my childhood, my young years I spent on 
the...in the vineyards.  So what more I can
 tell you about?   I learn...I was in elementary 
school in Hu_i, and, uh, high school in Hu_i.  
I couldn't go to the university, because I was 
taken to work for the army in 1939--Novemb
er 11, after the war broke between Germany 
and Poland. 
 
Q: Let's go back for a moment, please, and tell us about the community life in Hu_i. 
 
01:02:00 
 
A: Yes.  Uh, uh, the city of Hu_i
, it was a very interesting city from a social point of view. 
They are, uh, Roma nian, of course, the ma jo
rity.  It was a Bulgarian population, who, uh 
...they, uh ...they, uh, were vegetable, uh...gardeners.
  There are a kind of Hungarian people, 
they are most of them vineyard...vineyards [
NB:
 vintners]; and Jewish population.  The 
Jewish population, it wasn't  so big.  Around t
housand, or twelve hundred, uh, families.  Uh, 
the maj...majority of them are, uh, shopkeepers and, uh, artisans--tailors, shoemakers, uh, 

roof...uh, uh, they... they deal with roofings.  A
nd, uh, from a cult...cultural point of view, it 
was interesting that it was a library organi
zed in the...in the...by the Jewish community, 
which each of us...almost each generation of boys and girls from the high school, they work 

as a volunteers in this library.  So, uh, they
 organized, uh...they were organizing, um, the 
literary festivals and artistical festivals. 
 We...uh, I mean, it was a very interesting, uh, 
cultural life.  There was, uh, small newspaper, 
which I start when I was seventeen years old 
to publish some articles regarding the...the cit
y.  Epigrams--I liked this kind of thing when I 
was young.  So it was a kind of apprenticeship wr
iting, to this small newspaper.  And, uh, I 
have a cousin.  The cousin, he was a lawyer
.  He...he was a very talented, uh, writer and 
journalist; and he gave me...gave me the courag
e to start to do this.  I mean, it was the 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0049

beginning on my writing career, how to say.   
 
01:04:16 
 
Q: Would you tell us a few words about day-to-day life of your family?  
 
A: Uh, it was nothing exciting.  My were...my father
 was very busy with our vineyard.  She...he 
woke up in the early, early hour
 of the morning, being there.  Because I don't know if you 
know, a vineyard is taking a lot of work to...to 
maintain it, to keep it.  And, uh, my mother 
was home.  I have a sister, which she is...she is older as me--seven years.  She married very 

young.  She moved out from our house.  So I wa
s alone.  It was nothing...  Uh, I had friends--
boys and girls from my generation.  But we sp
ent all the time, our leisure hours out in the 
vineyards.  
 
Q: What happened to you once the war broke?  
 
01:05:14 
 
A: As a ma tter of fact, it happens in this...in 1939, 
in the summer, I was very sick.  I was...I took 
a cold.  I...I caught a cold.  
I don't know how to say in English "pleurisy"; I have water in 
my...my lungs.  I was very, very sick.  But i
n... later in the summer, in the beginning on the 
September, I start to recover.  And I...I was 
in our vineyard, because 
it was fresh air.  And, 
uh, I have received good nourishment from my...m
y family.  So, uh, when war broke, I was 
home.  Uh, I was home, recovering from my illn
ess.  And in November, when I first...I 
received an order to present myself to the
...my uh...my, uh, regime nt, I could try to postpone 
the military duty, because I was still not recove
red.  But I want to do this, because I...I 
understood there wasn't  any reason to postpone. 
 Because anyway I'll be...I'll have to go 
to...to... to the army.  So, uh, in November 11, 
when the war broked, already I was in the 
army.  And I was tried...uh, I...I trained very ha
rdly.  And it was a very hard winter in 1939-
1940; and after then, the spring of 1940, I was se
nt, uh, on the military zone in northern part 
of, uh, Moldavia where my regime nt belongs. 
 I was in the Regime nt, 9th Regime nt of 

Infantry from Rîmnicu S_rat.  So being in the army, I was trained during the during the 
summer and we walked to the fortificati
on facing... facing the Russian comi ng from the 
northern part of Moldavia.  We  didn't know 
about if they'll ...if they'll come; then nobody 
thought....  But we worked to this kind of for
tification all the peri
od of time.  And the 
summer of, uh, 1940, it was a Russian ultimatum asking Romanian to cede the Bessarabia 
[and], uh, northern part of Bukovina.  I was, 
uh, near...uh, two or three kilome ter fr...from, 
uh, uh, small city--the name is Her_a--which, uh, which never was, uh, in the occupied by 
the Russian.  But it was in the Moldavian part. 
 And the Russians, they were interested to 
have, uh, bridge in[to], uh, uh, Roma
nia.  So they took...they took this city of Her_a, too. 
And, uh...and after then, we retreat.  It was, uh...I
 retreat from, uh... with the whole army, the 
Romanian army, fr om this point 'til Roman--t
he city Roma n.  Day and night, day and night; 
uh, because it was...  We were under very big pressure, because behind us it was the 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0049

Roma nian army from Bessarabia [and] from 
Bukovina, who has to escape.  And, uh, after 
then, being in Roman--as a matter of fact, in a village near Roman--I, uh...I being Jewish, 
and, uh, with other people...and other soldier 
being Jewish, we were expelled from the 
Army.
1
  And I reme mber, because I was on act...on active duty. 
 
01:08:56 
 
 I didn't have even civilian clothes with me.  
So they give me  some  kind of clothes fr om 
the...from their warehouse, which didn't fit on me
.  Which was...I was almost naked.  And I 
receive orders to present myself to the to the 
regiment in Rîmnicu S_rat.  And it was...it was 
a problem to, uh, to take the train and to 
ma ke the journey to... to, uh, Rîmnicu S_rat, 
because everybody, it was military.  And w
ho was was dressed like me , know...know...they 

know exactly that...that I...I was a Jew.  So it was
...it was very dangerous to make this trip to, 
to Rîmnicu S_rat; because uh, well, I...I could be
 beaten or just threw out...threw out of ...of 
the window--which that happened to ma ny peopl
e.  So I ma naged to escape.  And, uh, I 

present the second day I was to the regiment.  
And they give me ...they give me  a order to go 
home, and to wait for new...new...new disposition.  
I arrived home.  And after three days or 
four days, I receive an order to come back 
to the regiment on September 1st, 1940.  I come 
back.  And I was...I, I was sent 
to, uh, in the working battalions.  It was not yet in the labor 
camp.  All the former soldiers, they have to 
go to the work...to the fo
rtification.  And I was 
sent to the Carpathian Mountains and, uh, the 
city...the small city Tîrgu Neam_, working the 
fortification facing the Hungarian border.  
That's...this was the period of time when the 
br...the war broke.  And, uh, when in the summe
r of 1941 I was home, sent back from the 
working battalions.  And I worked in the city
 [of Hu_i], sent doing kind of cleaning the 
streets and something like this.  Not...not 
too hard.  It was very humiliating, because 
everybody knows us.  But we didn't have another choice. 
 
01:11:16 
 
 I remember that the war broke against th
e Russians on June 22nd [1941].  It was Sunday. 
Saturday, in the afternoon, all Jewish male from
, uh, the age of eighteen to sixty, we have to 
present ourselves to the police quarter.  I di
dn't know why.  So I was there; and there we 
were locked up.  Nobody can leave.  We  left...we 
slept in the courtyard of the police quarter 
in Hu_i.  And in the dawn, we'r e sent to
 an unknown destination.  What was known, it was 
that I heard going to the villages that the war 
broke.  And we heard the orders that everybody 
has to go to war against the...the Russians.  
As...an interesting story which I remember, that 
we arrived in a small village in a nearby count
y near, Tutova, is the name of this county. 
And the village, the name is Bogdana.  I can't  
forget it.  And we stood there for one night 
waiting for some orders.  I don't know what kind of
 order we expected.  But I remember, that 
it was in afternoon of this same  day that, uh, an
 officer from the gendarmerie came to us. 
And we know very well who the gend...the...the...the
 gendarmerie is.  They were the most

 This would have been early in August 1940.

oppressive part of the Romanian Army.  But I have to tell you that this man, it was a very 
kind ma n.  And he told us, "Don'
t be afraid, as long as you are under my jurisdiction.  If I...if 
I have to go to eat, I'll never eat if I 
know that you are hungry...uh, hungr
y."  His name is 
[Gheorghe] Pris_caru.  And I reme mber that 
after the war, I wrote about this man, in 
September 1944.  But from...from Bogdana, it come s 
the order to go to a city of Bîrlad. 
(Cough)  I am sorry.  And now, in the Bîrlad, we are...we embarked on the train, the cattle 

train, and sent to a camp--deportation camp.  A
nd the city, it was Tîrgu Jiu.  And we arrived 
in Tîrgu Jiu after a journey of two or three days
.  But on this our journey to Tîrgu Jiu, I want 
to tell you something which I like to be made...made...make it public. 
 
01:14:25 
 
 
We stopped in a city--the name is Craiova--to cha
nge the engine to go to Tîrgu Jiu.  It was in 
the morning.  The soldier opened the doors from th
e cattle cars.  And some of us stepped out, 
just to take a breathe of fresh air.  And a 
petty ma n from the... working, uh...a worker from 
the...from the railroad, come to these people and...and start to mug them, taking their money 

and things which they have.  An engine ma
kes a ma neuver, and ...and the neighbor from the 
train.  And the mech...the mechanic from the engine saw this ma n mugging people.  He 

stopped the engine, stepped down; and he went 
to this guy who who continued to do it, to 

mug.  He slapped him in the face.  He sai
d, "Give back everything!"  The guy, uh...the...the 
guy, he was afraid of [the mechanic], and he 
gave everything [back].  This ma n stepped up 
on the engine, started the engine, and he'll go 
continue his work.  I don't know his name .  I 
never saw him in my life.  But I feel that I 
have to tell this story.  In the beginning on the 
war, when in Ia_i the Jews start to be killed 
by the Romani...the same people.  We arrived in 
the camp of Tîrgu Jiu. 
 
01:16:18 
 
 It was something unbelievable huge.  I want to
 tell you that this camp of Tîrgu Jiu was built 
by the Polish army.  When Polish was destroyed 
and occupied by the Russian, a part of the 
Polish Army was evacuated in Roma nia.  So this...this camp was built by the Polish Army. 
Now in this period of time, the Polish Army le
ft Romania--this is another story.  So it [
NB:
 
Tîrgu Jiu] was a concentration camp.  It was th
e first concentration [camp], beside other: 
Caracal, and Lugoj, and Miercurea-Ciuc, and so on. 
 But this was the biggest of all of them. 
And, uh, this camp, it was a very interesting mi xtur
e of people. It...it was divided in four and 
seven classes...uh, seven departments.  And this department one or two, it was ...it was some 
opposition of the Antonescus--and, uh, generals and, 
uh, diplomats, which they paid to stay 
there.  And the third class, it was a Legionary
--the fascists.  I'll tell you that, entering in 
this...in this camp, I said to myself, "Hey.  At least, here I'll be, uh, nobody's yelling to me. 

No...no ...no...no...no...nobody will call me  dirty name s, and so
 on."  Walking in front of this, 
uh, [third] departme nt of the labor camp, which 
we didn't know who they are--these people, 
they start to yell to us and curs...cursing us. 
 I said, "Here, too? !"  Where there are the 
Legionnaires.  And departme nt four, there were
 woma ns.  The departme nt five, it was the 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0049 
5
 
 
evacuees.  We  stood [
NB:
 stayed] in the evacuees depart
ment.  It was the department 
number six, it was the suspects of communist
s.  And number seven, these were the 
communists.  There are separate quarters, but 
we managed to communicate with each other. 
Of course, not with the Legionnaires!  Uh, afte
r a short period of time,
 uh, part of us they 
sent to work in the garden...in the gardening.  And another part, there are sent the place...it 
was, uh, Valea or Valea Jiului, which was,
 where it was a famous lieutenant commander--
Trepadu_--which was the criminal, and after th
e war he was judged as a criminal.  Uh, we 
stood [
NB:
 stayed] in...in the camp of Tîrgu Jiu w
ith a period of time, uh, four months, 
almost four months, when we are sent back in Hu_i. 
 
01:19:14 
 
 And we are put in, uh, a local camp, into the 
courtyard of the Jewish community.  We are 
obliged to wear the yellow badge.  And we ar
e fr om time to time allowed to go home and to 
change our underwear.  Talking about this, I want
 to repeat another story about this, what 
happens.  When I received my first, uh, "appr
oval," how to say, to go home to change my, 
my, uh, underwear, it was in Hu_i.  Uh, I reme
mber that it was way to go to...to my hou... 
my parents' home.  And I know [one is] qu
ite, uh...not a very, uh...not a center of the street; 
but I said, "No, I have to go through the center of
 the street."  I'm wear the badge, so I ...I 
didn't care.  I want to go see people, a
nd people to see me; because everybody knows me 
there.  And I remember that walking on the 
street, I saw a girl which it was a very good 
friend of my young years.  And she saw me , t
oo.  But she saw...seeing me  comi ng with the 
yellow badge, she crossed the street.  She didn't wa
nt to talk to me.  And I walked farther. 
And it was in the center of the street;  people usually walked in the center, they stood [
NB:
 
stayed], they talk to them.  And a friend of
 mi ne, uh, which are very close, he was a...a 
Roma nian.  And he saw me .  And in front of
 all the people, he came to me and he hugged 
me.  It was just a rebellion, to hug a Jew with
 a...with...with a yellow badge.  And I want to 
say this, and to be--how to say?--forever.  Because
 I can't  forget this.  Unfortunately, he died 
after the war.  He was...he has tuberculosis.  
But doesn't  matter.  I want to talk about my 
friend. 
 
01:21:22 
 
 Uh, in this period of time being in camp in 
Tîrgu Jiu, it happened something with my father 
which it was very important and very difficult period of time.  As I told you, my father, it 

was a very well-known person in city.  A very
 honest ma n, with a... 
with a high degree of 
dignity and pride.  If he borrows fr
om some body...somebody some thing, every penny he 
give back.  And he kept his whole word.  
So I told you that Sunday morning, on June 22nd, 
we were sent to the camp to...to Tîrgu Jiu.  So it was Monday, Tuesday, 
We dnesday...somebody knocked to our door.  We
 know--my father told me, my mother--
they never even saw these people.  And he star
t to talk:  "Hey, Mr. Butnaru!  How are you? " 
In Yiddish.  And he said, my father, "I 
don't know who you are."  
"Oh, it doesn't  matter you 
don't know me .  Don't worry!  The Russians are 
comi ng.  Our brothers will be here.  You'll 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0049

be liberated!"  My father was very...  "Who are you, sir?   I don't make politics.  I don't talk 
about this.  I have my problems."  And this man, 
he continued to talk in
 this way.  And after 
that:  "Don't worry, we'll see each other."  And 
he left.  And this afternoon, my father was 
arrested with another nine people from Hu_i. 
 Leading person, and director of our bank, uh, a 
bookkeeper, a young lady, a pianist--and they'r e beaten
 to death to try to tell, ask them...ask 
them to tell them where their...they have thei
r communist meetings.  And my father was a 
communist?   I don't know if you are talking 
about some body who is a...to speak in Hindu 
language.  And after then, [they] were sent in a trial. Because the war...the war zone, it was 
very close from Hu_i.  They was to be to be se
nt to a military court to be judged.  Their luck 
it was that the military fr ont moved far away ve
ry fa st fr om Hu_i, so they they weren't 
anymore in this jurisdiction of the military court. 
 The, a martial court.  So they were sent to 
a military court, but not, uh, for the front zone
.  I don't know if you unders
tand me exact.  It 
was a trial in...in the city Gala_i; they sent to th
is court.  How much they hate the Jews, they 
couldn't do this mockery.  So they acquit them, a
ll of them.  But they ask the local authority 
from the city of Hu_i to kept them like... 
like, uh, hostage, as a gua
rantee.  If will be a 
sabotage some where in this neighborhood of our c
ity, they'll be shot.  So when I came home 
from the city, from the camp...from the Tîrgu Jiu, 
I was very surprised that my father didn't 
come  to see me .  Only my mother. 
 
01:25:24 
 
 Everybody, waiting from my mother, for...for
 my father; because everybody's looking for 
relatives to come.  Uh, I talked to some
 people who knows me , and everybody said, "Okay. 
Is okay with your father.  Don't worry."  Bu
t I didn't know to what to worry, because my 
mother hadn't any opportunity to write me being in...in the camp of Tîrgu Jiu.  Later on, I 
saw my mother come --of course, wearing the ba
dge.  And she told me this story that my 
father is not home.  Uh, my father is arrest
ed in a military, uh, barracks, near the the...the 

border of Hu_i.  So after a c
ouple of months, we are allowed to go home, as the...as the...as 
the local camp was dismantled.  And my father 
was allowed to come  home, too; but he has 
to present himself each week to the police 
to sign in, in...in a book that he didn't leave 

the...the city.  Uh, in this period of time in
 Romania, it was the Legionary government with 
Antonescu.  It was in the fall of 1941.
2
  The situation, it was terrifying.  My father lost 
everything--the vineyard, the harvest.  It happe
ned to be a very good year with wine, and full 
of...it was the...the cellar full with wine.  
And, uh, they start to take the houses and 
everything.  One night was...I was arr...arrested by the Legionary police; and kept arrested.... 
 
01:27:32 
 
Q: Excuse me .  This happened before the Tîrgu Jiu camp?  
 
 
    
2
 Antonescu declared Romania a "National Legiona
ry State" after King Carol II fled the country 
in September 1940.

A: After. 
 
Q: After?  
 
A: After.  I told you.  Tîrgu Jiu, it was on the 
beginning of the war with Russia.  It was the 
summer of 1941, and I stood in the camp 'til 
September 1941.  In September 1941, I come 
back.  My father was hostage, and I was in 
a local camp.  In the fall of 1941 the camp, local 
camp, was dismantled.  My father was allowed 
to come  home.  The Legionary governme nt, 
it was in full power.  We  took out...we lost ever
ything--the vineyard, the house, everything. 
From our big house, we are allowed... allowed 
to live in a one room in...was near...which 
was a kitchen.  It was all which we possessed. 
 One day I was arrested, I said...I told you, by 
the Legionary police.  And I have to confess,
 I wasn't  beaten.  I heard people yelling and 
moaning, because they were [being] beaten.  They
 didn't beat me.  Because all of them, they 
are former colleagues and from our childhood.  And 
they didn't dare to do this to me.  They 
didn't do this to me .  But they are my friends, all of them.  So we decided we have to do 
something.  We decided to do something; becau
se the situation, it was very dangerous.  And 
if I was so lucky not to be beaten once, w
ho knows what will be the second time?   So one 
night...one day, I went to the police quarter.  I 
paid a fee; and my father found a friend of 
ours, and he bribed a police...a policeman
 from the office to give me  the...the 
auth...authorization to leave the c
ity.  And I left the city to Bucharest.  My father and my 
mother left in Hu_i.  So in January...no, in 
December.  December 1941.  So in the beginning 

of 1942--no, 1940...1941 ...  No.  I am a little b
it mi xed...no, no, no.  Yes.  Uh, no. There 
were.... 
 
Q: It's all right. 
 
A: No, no, no.  In 1941, it was the Legionary m
oveme nt.  Uh, the war started in, uh, 1941 in 
June, so you have to...in the...to ...to make to edit this part of...  I can try to...to tell again. 
 
Q: That's fine.  Don't worry about it. 
 
01:30:44 
 
A: Yes.  I am mi xed a little bit the dates.  Becau
se I want to be very precise.  So we, uh...I...I 
was in Bucharest in 1941, in January.  Uh, to...of
 a...to a family...to a relative of ours, very 
close relatives.  As, uh...as they lived near Hala... 
the place which is Hala Traian.  The street, 
it was Miti_a Constantinescu; and not so far fr om
 the Jewish quarter, which is V_c_re_ti and 
Dude_ti.  I remember when the, uh, Legionary revolution...uh, rebellion started.
3
  We  heard, 
we...we are close to...to the radio, listening to wh
at happens on the street.  I...I...I remember 
the shootings around the house.  And, uh, one, I
...I...I looked through the windows; and I saw 
the, the, the Legionary in their...in their trucks, and with with the...the flags and the green 
 
    
3
 The Iron Guard rebellion took place from January 21-23, 1941.

flags and tri-colored flags, running on the street
s with their motorcycles.  I saw across the 
street.  I watched through the window when a... 
when a...when a...a car stopped in front of 
the window.  Uh, three or four people, they 
would go out.  Here, they enter the house and, 
uh, they took some body and left.  And, uh, I reme mb
er very vividly that the second day, the 
second day of the rebellion,
4
 when we heard that the Legionary, they, uh, the gave up, 
they...they surrendered.  I went to V_c_re_
ti and to Dude_ti, and I visit them.  I 
remember...uh, house after house, it was pillaged a
nd burned.  Uh, I saw...I was in the ... on 
the front of the morgue, which is situated
 not close from the River Dîmbovi_a, with 
the...surrounded by tanks.  And people--Jews--trying to enter in the morgue...in the morgue; 
because they want to recognize the...the relativ
es, their loved ones, who they are killed in...in 
this period and then during this, uh, rebellion.  U
h, I have very vivid memory of this period 
of time.  I tried, the house which were...where
 lived, which was not attacked by the...by the 
Legionnairies.  But I remember very well ever
ything.  After then, the relatives--it was an 
uncle of ours--he left to Hu_i to see what happe
ns with my family.  Because they didn't want 
to allow me  to go home.  And, um, he stood th
ere for a period of time--two weeks, three 

weeks--and he came back.  And he said to
 me , "I think you can go home now.  But, 
uh...(pause) you'll find your father okay.  He is 
okay now."  I didn't know what happens.  He 
had a stroke.  He used to go...  (Crying)  I'm sorry. 
 
01:34:37 
 
Q: It's all right. 
 
A: (Pause)  He used to go everyday on a certain
 point on a street, looking to his vineyard like 
some body's going to see a beloved one.  (Cryi
ng)  And one day, comi ng home, he had a 
stroke.  Some body has to carry him home on his s
houlder.  He couldn't walk.  But it happens 
that he was a very strong ma n; and he...he ma na
ged, how to say, to survive this.  And when I 
came home, he was a broken ma n.  He was very...he
 lost a lot of weight.  But he used to 
walk, and he talked; and it was a mi racle.  So he didn't know nothing.  And the summe r, 

when the war start, I told you that he was ver
y, very hard...very brutal beaten by the officer 
who...who tried to find out he... he was a communist.  But he was...he...he ma naged 
to...to...to survive this period of time.  So, af
ter the camp I told you, we'r e in...in the local 
camp; and we, uh...we were sent to work to cl
ear the street of snow, and the highways of 
snow.  Because I...I told you, Hu_i
, it was a very important point to go to the front line.  So 
the highways should be cleared by snow;  the
...the tanks, and the comm...and the lorries, and 
the [soldiers] too can walk.  And the springtim
e, we...we used to work in the same , uh, way 
around the city; and...and the summer of 1942, it was 
the first detachment of Jews sent to 
Bessarabia.  Which is just a new chapter in my life.

 It was the first labor...labor battalion, labor cam
p, which I was sent.  I was sent...the city, it 
was Bolgrad, the capital of the county Cahul.  The railroad stopped in a certain station--the 
name, it was Bulg_rica--thirteen kilometers [nor
theast] from Bolgrad.  So if somebody has to 
go to Bolgrad, has to stop... ma ke a stop in this 
station, Bulg_rica, and to take a coach or 
something--which we didn't (laughter) take, of 
course--to go to Bolgrad.  But not...this is not 
the point where I am talking about, Bulg_rica. 
 When we arrived there, it was in the mi ddle 
of the summer.  And a terrible, terrible stink.  It was an insupportable stink.  We couldn't 
understand what is this smell here.  And, uh, 
I asked...we asked people, "What...why is this 
smell here? "   They didn't want to answer.  S
o, arriving in Bulg_rica, we put...we were put in 
a column around...surrounded by the...the gendarmes
, and...and went to the...to the direction 

to, uh, Bolgrad.  We  entered in this city of 
Bolgrad, and it was a Dante-esque view.  Try to 
imagine:  You enter in a city--empty city, em
pty streets.  Nobody on the streets.  The houses, 
they don't have doors.  The windows are smashed. 
 Everything is pillaged.  Just one dog, or a 
cat, running on the street.  In the center of the street, it was, uh...it was some buildings 
occupied by the Romanian admi nistration.  And we as
ked to stay there, to be sent in a certain 
direction.  We  didn't know nothing. 
 
01:39:44 
 
 Sitting there, waiting for orders, some Jewsstart to...to walk around. 
 An officer come , uh, 
uh, with a horse... riding a horse. 
 And he saw the people, uh, walking around; and he start 
beating them with...with...with a whip.  With a 
whip, so everybody was very concentrate.  A 
friend of mi ne, he was a little bit older as me--two
 or three year older.  He told me, "Do you 
know something?   I was here in Bolgrad, in...in my military duty in an artillery regiment...the 

art...the number 30[th] Regime nt 
of Artillery from Bolgrad.  And I remember that in a Purim 
night, Jews from Bolgrad used to go to this
 regiment and ask the commander to allow the 
Jewish boys in the Army to come to this Je
wish houses to celebrate the festi... the...the 
festivity of...the festival of Purim.  So I reme mber
 that the house is not so far.  It's very close 
from here.  Do you want to go with me  to this
 house?   I want to see this house."  And we 
went.  You know, it's a very interesting mome nt which I can't  forget.  And I think I wrote 

about this in my book.  Imagine, I went in 
this house--completely empty. And this guy start 
to tell me, "In this corner, it was a piano. 
 And on this piano, a young lady plays a piano. 
And the house was full with people, and the sm
ell of food.  And ever
ything, it was alive. 
And now everything is dead.  Only ghosts."  
And I understand then why it was this smell in 
the ...in the station of Bulg_rica.  It was a 
common grave, a ma ss grave.  The people from 
Bolgrad, they are shot and put in this grave.
  After then, uh, we sw
ear...we went to, uh...to a 
village, the name it was Cubei.  It was a quarry. 
 We start to work in this quarry.  A hard 
labor.  We  went...we were obliged to ma ke a 
cubic me ter of stones taken from the, from 
the... from...from the earth.  And we worked 'til then late in the fall. 
 
01:43:02 
 
 We  were exhausted, without clothes.  And we
 are sent by train to, 
uh, Dobruja [region], to 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0049

another famous, uh, quarry.  It was Turcoaia. 
 The county, it was Tulcea.  The city was 
M_cin.  And I reme mber that leaving from...f
rom Bulg_rica, from Bul...Bessarabia to...to 
Turcoaia, to...to Gala_i to Br_ila to cro
ss the River, uh, Da...Da...Danube, it was terrible 
cold... cold.  And I didn't manage to enter 
in, in, in a...in a wag...wagon, you know.  So I 
stood on the stairs of the train.  And I said, "I'
ll froze.  I'll got froze."  And I...I...I go down, 
and I put around me a...a...some rug.  I have a r
ug.  I slept on this rug, so it protected me. 
And I didn't froze.  I have this train.  So 
we cross the Danube; and we start to work in 
Cubei...in, uh, Turcoaia, to the qua
rry.  It was a very hard situation there.  We are under the 
command of a certain Captain Munteanu--a de
generate drunkard, [who] played cards. 
He...he need money all the time.  He took our
s...all our money which we still have.  And 
uh...and it was late in October, late in Novemb
er, when we were allowed to go home for a 
short period of time to change our clothes, to 
take our winter...winter clothes.  And after the 
Christma s, we have to go home [
NB:
 to the quarry].  Then I wrote on this card, on a... "I 
have to go to camp.  It's after Christmas." 
 We  go back to...to Turcoaia, and we stood [
NB:
 
stayed] there over the winter.  In the spring, we
 start to work to, uh...um, at some railroad, to 
transport the...the... the, uh, stone from the quarry which we...we brought out. 
 
01:46:10 
 
 And, uh, it was 'til, uh...'til the '43, late in '43, 
when we moved to another, uh, camp not...not 
so from...from our hou...from Hu_i.  
It was near Bîrlad.  It was part of improvement of our 
life.  Because we ma naged to have some  fr
iends in Bîrlad;  they brought us some  food, 
some...brought some clothes.  So it was a little bit easy for us.  We sit over the winter in 
1943-1944; when, uh...when we were brought home in summe r of '44.  And we worked to 
the highways, to repair the highways near th
e city of Hu_i.  And, 
uh, in 1944, in August '44, 
it happens that the Hu_i, it was, uh, occupied by, uh, liberate [
NB:
 liberators]--we can say 
"liberate," but it's...it's the truth--by the Russi
an Army.  After a day, the Roma nians, uh, took 
over the... the city; which it was, uh, fig...stree
t fights.  But the third day, the Romanian 
retreat...the Romanian Army, uh, surrendered; a
nd, uh, we were, how to say, liberated.  And, 
uh, it was for us, the war, it was over.  It wasn't  
over for the rest of the Romania; but of this 
part of Moldavia, this part of Roma nia where 
I lived with my parents, we managed to...to...to 
go through this period of time with my sack...sack with bones.  So we survived.  What do 

you want to ask me  more?  
 
Q: Yah.  I...I would like to know what happened to you after the war. 
 
01:48:23 
 
A: After the war, I need a pair 
of pants.  (Laughter)  I need a a jacket.  And my father didn't 
have the money to give me, to ...to buy this.  I 
was young.  I want to talk to girls, to, to met 
people.  But I need the pants.  So my father give me his only one suit. 
 And we go to a tailor, 
and he tried to manage to arrange for myself.  So I was very well elegant in this period of 

time.  So we start to reorganize the life in Hu_i
.  We  need a ma yor.  We need a prefect.  We 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0049 
11
 
 
                        
need the police.  We  need a...a Chamber of 
Commerce.  We need to start to... to open the 
windows of the stores, and to have a normal lif
e.  And we'r e not...we start to have...to open 
the schools.  I receive a job as a Secretary 
of the Comm...of the Chamber of Comme rce.  I 
entered it; everything it was destroyed and br
oken.  We  didn't have...we didn't even have 
pencil to...to ...to start to write some orders 
and to give some authorization.  We had 
everything, (laughter) but it was a very funny 
situation.  Nobody...nobody give us order.  But 

we have to do something.  But I remember that
 after a short period of time--is to say three 
weeks, four weeks, of a kind of republic in 
Roma nia--a delegation of the governme nt from 
Roma nia come  in Moldova [
NB:
 Moldavia] to see what happened there.  Because nobody 
knows in Bucharest what happens in Moldova.  
So they start to say to us, "Look.  What you 
are, stay...stay in place.  You are the policem
an; you'll be the policeman.  You are the mayor; 
you'll be the ma yor."  So, uh, that we...they...the fi
rst thing what they did, they organized the 
Communist Party.  Which I didn't belong.  I sa
id, "It's time to think about."  So 1944, 1945 
and 1946, I didn't join the Communist Party.  In 
1946, I said, "It's any reason to stay in Hu_i?  
I don't want to do this here.  And I don't know...I
 don't think I have a future."  So we moved 
in Bucharest...to Bucharest. 
 
01:51:09 
 
 I tried to have a job.  I couldn't have a job, 
because I didn't...I wasn't  a Communist [Party] 
me mber.  Later...later, in 1947, when the Ca
rol [II], the king, has...was obliged to...to 
abdicate, it was no other way.
5
  So I said, "Okay, your way.  I am a Communist, too."  So we 
joined the Communist Party, and I have a job.  And, uh, I was a member of the Party 'til I left 
Romania.  And I remember when I received th
e citizenship here in America, the guy...the 
person from the Immi gration Office
6
 asked me, "But you are a long time in the Communist 
Party."  "Yes.  For a long time, 
I have to eat."  "But how come ? "   And I said, "Sir, you have a 
very nice job here, asking me  why.  Do you suppos
e if you have this job in Roma nia, asking 
people why, you can be or have 
the job without being a Communist Party [member]? "   And 
he start to laugh, "I know the story."  So I was a 
full soldier.  I clapped, when I have to clap. 
I have to stay ...uh, say, "Hurray," when I have to
 say, "Hurray."  And that was the life.  But 
after the war, it was something interesting in my
 life, living in Hu_i with a friend of mi ne. 
His name  is Anton Celaru.  I don't know if you 
know him.  He was a journalist working for 
Informa_ia Bucure_tiului for many years.  We stood [
NB:
 stayed] in.  We , uh, all here with 
Titi Fierstein, we, uh, printed then a newspaper.  I remember that the newspaper, the first 

newspaper after the war in this part of the 
world, has reprinted in two...two hundred copies. 
And they sold these copy through a window; because everybody wants to have this 

copy...uh, this newspaper.  What I remember about
 this newspaper is that my first article--
which I wrote after the "liberation," [so] to sa
y--it was an open letter to the Major Pris_caru. 
 
    
5
 It was not Carol II who abdicated in 1947, but
 his son, Michael I--who became king when his 
father fled the country in September 1940, shortly after Antonescu came to power.

Do you reme mber I told you, from this gendarme.  
I said, "I feel like I have the duty to wrote 
to you, and to thank you now for your humanity. 
 For the human feelings.  When we are 
down, we are nobodies, you told us you can't  eat
 as long as you know that we are hungry. 
So I am writing this letter to you."  I...I didn't know if he is alive.  I didn't know where he is. 
 
01:54:15 
 
 The story is that people from Hu_i, who after I 
left the ci...my city, they
 find him.  And they 
ask him to come to...to live with them.  But 
this is another story.  So, uh, I come in 
Bucharest.  I had a job in the 
Ministr...in the Department of Art.  And I was sent in a city 
Lugoj, in Banat [region], uh, being a Concierge 
Cultural--a cultural counsellor.  I don't know 
what.  After then, I was, uh, brought back in Bucharest.  I give, I...I receive a...a...an 

"advancement" [promotion], how to say it; and, 
uh, I was General Inspector.  I work with 
Octav Livezeanu and Eduard Mezinceascu.  And, 
uh, after then, I was, uh, a kind of ma nager 
of the Departme nt of the Cultural Houses fr
om the city...the Commitee Culturale, how to 

say; and, uh, I worked a lot of time there.  Suddenly, they reme mber me .  And they say, 
"Hey, hey!  Just a mi nute!  Who was your 
father? "   "My father was a vineyard [
NB:
 
vintner]."  "So you don't have a ...you don't have
 a...a sound origin.  You don't have...you are 
not...you are not a friend of ours.  You are...you are just a com...a road companion."  And 
they...they fire me .  And I was without j
ob, with...being a Communist, a me mber of the 
Communist Party, without a job.  And [they're] te
lling me that I...I...I am...I am an enemy of 
the people.  Later...later on, I r
eceive a job--the Department of Agriculture.  I said, "I don't 
have nothing common with this.  I...I don't know not
hing about this."  So I have to have this 
job for a good part of my life.  And, uh, b
ecause I didn't have nothing in common, with, 
uh...and I couldn't find a job in th
e Ministry--the Department of the Culture.  They didn't 
want to give me  back the job.  I found a job as
 a Secretary Literary 
was a...with a...with the 
circus, which I worked.  And kind of a period 
of time.  And they built the new building of 
the circus; I was the director of there--of this
 building, of this hall of activity, of cultural 
activities there.  And after then, I moved t
o, uh...I was General Secretary of the...of the 
publishing house of the Tourism, with Pop Simi on wa
s the director at this period of time.  I 
don't know if you know some ...something about Pop 
Simi on.  A nice ma n.  After then, I said 
to myself, "I build enough socialism.  The soci
alism is blowing in Roma nia; and [it] can 
blow without me , too."  So what I have to do?    To emigrate, it was not easy. 
 
01:57:33 
 
 Because we had some familial problems with the parents of my wife; so we couldn't leave 
the country.  But I didn't want; I considered I 
built enough socialism.  So one day, see, I said 
to myself, "I am sick.  Not just tired."  So
 I managed--paying a good money--to be retired as 

being a sick man; and from this position, after a couple of years, I emigrate to America.  
 
Q: Uh, we have to stop now because we need a short time to change tapes.

Q: We are on tape again.  And I'd like to ask you to
 describe for us the conditions of arriving in 
Hu_i immediately after the war. 
 
A: You know, I...I tried to recollect this period 
of time.  It's...  You know, never...I didn't think 
never about this.  But it was a kind of explosi
on.  A kind of rejoice. 
 You have to understand, 
from a psychological point of view, this situ
ation of this specially of the young people. 
Suddenly, from the bottom of the societ
y, you were some body.  You have to have...you 
can...have the opportunity to have a job.  Y
ou have a certain position--a certain position 
which you can never dream to have.  You are 
a human being, too.  You walk on the street, 
and people salute you.  And I remember some
thing which I like to tell you.  There is 
some thing which I just forgot.  One evening, I 
walked with a friend of mi ne.  A girl.  As 
usual in the center of a small city, everybody 
know each other.  And walking on the street, 
that was a group of three or four boys--old 
hooligans.  I know them.  And they saw me  
comi ng with the girl.  And they blocked my...my, uh...  I...I couldn't go 
through them.  It was 
only one way to do this--just to to go around them
.  In the same way in which I did all my 
life.  And I said [to myself], "This...now, I don't wa
nt to do this."  And I 
said, "Sorry.  I have 
to go through."  And they parted, and I went th
rough them.  It was the first time in my life 
then when I said, "I am some body.  You can't st
op me."  It was for a short period of time. 
After then, I learned my lesson.  The same Jane
t with another haircut, in Romania.  But 
anyway, it was a very...very interesting period 
of time.  People get married.  (Laughter) 
Everybody wants to ...to get ma rried, to...to have 
a family, to be together.  Uh,  everybody 
is...uh, a lot of people went to Bucharest, or to
 Ia_i, to start to...to 
study.  We  worked there 
in...in...in our city.  We  have our friends.  Myse
lf, I...I...I thought I have to...to...to get to get 
married.  But that happens like in life...as in life.
  And I didn't do this then.  So it was a very 
interesting period of time.  But shortly, a lot of
 things changed.  People there are poor.  They 
are poor.  The ...the war paid... 
 Everybody paid a great fee in this war.  So, uh, nobody had 
an opportunity to do some thing to improve the life, of condition. 
 
02:03:52 
 
 And the meantime, Moldavia was st...st... 
striken...strucken by a, uh, drought.  It was a 
fantastic fami ne in Moldavia.  So when...whe
n we...  I was in Hu_i and Bucharest; from 
leaving Hu_i, I tried to send something to my 
parents.  But it wasn't  enough.  It was a very 
high inflation in Roma nia.  Everybody ha
d...has to pay million.  They...they print 
mill...paper--bills, money--for five million leu.
7
  Only, for five m
illion you can buy nothing. 
Absolutely nothing.  So it was a very hard peri
od of time in Roma nia.  And the fami ne, and 
the people there are go...going from one
 part of the country to another part of the country.

And I remember when I received my first job, in March 19...in 1989 [
NB:
 1949], in Lugoj, 
in Banat [region].  In Banat, it wasn't  fami ne.  
It happens it was a luckier... luckier part of the 
Romania.  And I went to a restaurant and 
I asked to give me  some thing, some , uh...some 
food.  I couldn't eat, because it was period of 
time when I didn't [have] what to eat in 
Bucharest.  And so it...it was a very hard situa
tion in Romania.  Very hard.  I don't talk about 
the political situation; because from the political 
point of view, it was st
art to be hard from 
the end of 1980...1948 and beginning of 1989 [
NB:
 1949].  It was a period of changeme nt, 
fr om the political point of view.  But as individua
l, it was hard to live in Romania.  We didn't 
have what to eat.  So for me , when ...when...whe
n my boss in the Departme nt of Arts told 
me , "Where do you want to go to have a j
ob in province? "  I said, "Everywhere it's 
some thing to eat!"  So they send me  to Lugoj, which is a heaven for me . 
 
02:06:04 
 
Q: Could you describe, please, your arrival in United States?  
 
A: Arrival in United States? 
 
Q: Your comi ng to America. 
 
A: We  arrived...we arrived on the...on the October 27 
or 29-- something like this.  In the fall. 
Hey, it's interesting, what I...what I felt fo
r the first time.  Uh, we, uh...we, uh...I, uh...we 
receive a...  We  are transferred from Kenne
dy Airport to, uh, La...LaG
uardia Airport; and I 
received a room in a motel.  It was hot.  It was 
stuffy.  No air.  And as
 a Roma nian, I went to 
open the doors.  But the door, it was locked.  
I went to open the window.  The windows there 
are locked.  And I said, "Where in Hell you can 
have a little bit of fresh air in America?" 
And my daughter said, "Look, you have the air conditioner.  Turn the air conditioner, you 

have fr esh air."  It was my fi rst contact in America.  But before all this, the man fr om the 
Customer [
NB:
 Customs], he opened ....  I brought from
 the American Embassy from Paris 
a... a yellow envelope.  And the lady from th
e Ame...from Embassy from Paris told me , 
"You have to give...  Uh, don't open this e
nvelope; because you have...there are very 
important documents here.  And, uh, you have to
 give to the Custom."  And I give the 
envelope to the Custom, and they open the...the
...the envelope.  And he gave to me , to my 
wife and to my daughter my...our "green card."  
And he said, "You are a resident in America, 
and you are all welcome here."  So I, as an 
American resident comi ng there in America. 
Because we came to be unified with our famil
y.  Uh, I remember, regarding our arrival here 
in, uh...I remember that I had a discussion with th
e director from HIAS from Paris--a certain 
Schwartz (ph)
.  Gentlema n Schwartz.  And he to
ld me  once, "You have... you'll have 
problems to accommodate in America.  But don'
t be...don't worry.  Go to Boston.  You'll find 
there people there who they are not related 
with you.  They'll help you.  They don't let you 
down."  I looked to this ma n.  And I said, "Ma
ybe he knows what he's talking about."  But I 
was...I was very afraid.

 Later on, when I wrote and I published my last book, 
Moshe Kopf and His World
, I wrote a 
short story about this encounter with the man w
ith a straight face.  U
h, I think I said it's a 
tribute.  I remember my social worker--a lady.  He [
NB:
 she] has a small...a small office in 
Boston, in the Jewish Family [Services].  And I talked to her so ma ny times.  And I 
says...every time when I left from this office, I said to myself, "If some body has the 
opportunity to record the echoes of
 the voices who talk to this lady [in] this small office, it'll 
be a universe of human sufferings!"  And I said, "I have to pay [
NB:
 repay] this something 
for this lady."  And my first publish...published, uh, piece which I wrote, it was an open letter 

to this lady--"The Unseen Diploma."  She had behind her her diploma as social worker.  But 
I talked about her soul, her wonderful, uh, human 
feelings.  So I wrote a piece, which is in 
my book, too--"The Unseen Diploma."  And there 
are a lot of people who tried to help us. 
And with my broken English, when I start 
to talk to people everybody's saying, "Oh, your 
English is very good!"  I know how good is my
 English.  (Chuckling)  But I know those 
people try to understand us.  They give us shelte
r.  They give us food.  They give us hope. 
You understand...have to understand some thing. 
 I discover my identity, not living in 

Roma nia so ma ny years.  I didn't left Roma
nia a young man.  I don't want to say I'm a old 
[man] now, but I wasn't  young then.  I discovere
d my....  I suffered like a Jew in Roma nia; 
but I didn't know I am Jew, because I never considered.  I was a Romanian!  Here, I discover 

I am Jew.  And I discover the whole story 
about the Holocaust, and what happened in 
Roma nia.  Here, in the United States.  You know, I had a job at Boston University. 
 
02:12:12 
 
Being here in America, I said--and I...I didn't have [a job]--"Without a language and a good English, 

what I can do?   The only thing which I can do is
 to be a kind of a bookkeeper or accountant, or 
something like this."  So I attended a university c
ourse, which I finished with A+.  And I have a 
diploma in accounting.  So I was in accounting, 
but I am a writer by profession.  So each...each 
lunch time, every day...absolutely every day in my
 lunch time, I went to the library and make 
research in trying to find out about the Romania,
 Roma nian Jew, Roma nian history, and so on. 
So...so I start to write my book, 
The Forgotten Holocaust
.

  This book is not my book.  Each line, 
each word, each page--I did it.  I written...I write it.  
But this doesn't  belong to me .  It's the book of 
my generation, of my people.  And being here in Am
erica, I had opportunity to read it...to write this. 
Living so ma ny years in Roma nia and going so 
many years in the library of that academy in 
Roma nia, ma king research from my books which I 
wrote there, I never think about it.  Because 
nobody give me the opportunity to see a newspaper, a piece of paper regarding this period of time. 
So if somebody is...can accept this euphemi sm "born in the second time," I am born....  I emigrate, 

because being a Jew in Roma nia....  Here in Ameri
ca that I discovered [mysel
f] to be a Jew, living 
here in America.  This is...it was something which 
which I can't forget.  It is not to...to say, "Thank

you, America.  You did this, so and so."  This re
lationship between me and America, it is another 
kind. 
 
02:14:20 
 
A kind of a...  And I have to tell you some thing. 
 My character...my character, uh, Moshe Kopf, in 
my last book, he used to live in Roma nia.  And 
he has to exp...to ...to talk to some body, to express 
himself; but he was afraid.  So 
he wrote a letter to himself.  And the second part of my book, when 
he lived in America [
NB:
 Roma nia? ] waiting for the America vi
sa, he wrote to a friend of, uh, him 
letters in Romania.  Arriving in America, he wrot
e letter to the same le....uh, 
friend.  And it is a letter 
which is very important to this problem--me and Am
erica.  My relationship with the United States. 
Moshe Kopf, walking in New York one day, me t a very interesting person--Christoforus Columbus. 
And he start to...they start to walk, to talk t
ogether.  And Moshe Kopf 
said to...to...to Christopher 
Columbus, "You know, Master, you did a great job 
discovering America.  But, you know, if you are 
doing something to be good, you have to do it in a ri
ght time.  You discovered America too late!" 
And Christopher Columbus asked him, "What means, 
't oo late.'"  "Of course it is too late!  If you 
discovered America when the Je
w were liberated by Moshe [
NB:
 Moses] from their...their slavery 
...slave situation in Egypt, instead of cross the Red Mer [
NB:
 Red Sea], you can part the water in the 
Atlantic here.  He is ..."  How to say?   "He knowed  how to do the job.  He can
 part the water in the 
Atlantic, and the Jew can arrive in America. 
And he can avoid so much persecution, blood, and 
tears, and so on."  And Christopher Columbus said
 to him, "Maybe you're right.  Who knows? "  And 
he depart from him, and he go back on his,
 uh, pedestal.  Moshe Kopf, leaving Christopher 
Columbus, he thought...he said.  And Christopher sai
d, "Come back.  I want to tell you something. 
Go back and discover 
your
 America.  I discovered a territory
 which is America.  But everybody 
who is arriving on this shore has 
to discover his own America.  Two Americas are not the same ." 
No sir.  I discovered my America here.  And I am very grateful for this.  
 
Q: I think that this is a beautiful end.  Uh, thank you very, very much for comi ng. 
 
A: Thank you.  Thank you for giving me  the opportunity to talk.
