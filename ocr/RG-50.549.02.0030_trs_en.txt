Beginning Tape One, Side A 
Question: United States Holocaust Memo ri
al Museum Jeff and Toby Herr collection. 
This is an interview with Frima Laub, 
conducted by Ginger Miles,
 on Novemb er 23rd, 
1998, in Woodmere, Long Island. This is 
a follow up interview to a United States 
Holocaust Memo rial Museum videotaped in
terview, conducted with Frima Laub on May 
seventh, 1990. The United States Holocaust 
Memo rial Museum gratefully acknowledges 
Jeff and Toby Herr for making this interview possibl
e. This is tape one, side A. This is a 
brief ambiance in the home of Frima Laub. This is a few seconds of silence in Frima 
Laub™s home. There is, in the background, all 
sorts of, I guess wind blowers. They are -- 
It™s a beautiful fall day and neighbors are ta
king the opportunity to clean off the leaves. 

So, we are starting, along with the lawn materi
al, which we will forget about. I wanted to 
ask you first, Frima, if you could give me your
 full name as a child and the name of each 
of your immediate family members and just
 a little bit about them. Maybe where you all 
were at first. 

Answer: When you say at first, at first be
fore World War Two, or during World War 
Two? Okay, my name is Frima. Maiden name
 was Glaser. We used Glaser-Better, B-e-t-
t-e-r. My mother™s name is Eta, my father™s name was Mayer, M-a-y-e-r. My brother™s 

name is David, my  sister™s name is Jeanni
e. You said you wanted to know mo re about -- 
Q: A little bit about where you lived before the war and what he did and -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030

A: Okay. Mm-hm. Okay, before the war, we liv
e in a very lovely city, by the name of 
Volachisk -- I™m sorry, not Volachisk, Pr
oscurov, which is near Volachisk and 
Potvolachisk, where the rest of my relatives
 were born. Some were born in Volachisk, 
some were born in Potvolachisk. But, we 
moved when I was still a little girl. We moved 
to Proscurov, which is a larger city.  
Q: In the Ukraine? 

A: And it was in the Ukraine, right and that
™s not too far from Kiev. Okay? We had the 
home there, of course. My mo ther was a housewife, my  father was in the import and 

export -- actually mo stly export, meat export 
business. My brother was studying in Kiev, 
in the engineering school and my  sist
er was going to school in Proscurov. 
Q: Okay. 

A: We did -- 

Q: We-We™ll -- We™ll return later to your re
lationship with your -- your family memb ers, 
but first, I wanted to ask you some of the 
things, just to clear up from the 1990 interview 
that was done at the Holocaust Museum. Did 
you have any idea of what year it was, or 
how old you were when you first stayed alone with the Gentile woman? 

A: Yes, that was in 1942, after the second pogr om in Proscurov. This is where --  My 

mother felt that she had to leav
e the city, of course, with my sister -- at that time, we 
didn™t know where m -- our father was. A
nd my  brother, of course, we didn™t know 
where he was, since he was in Kiev, since be
fore the war -- the war started. So, that was 
after the second pogrom, when my mother fe
lt everybody was killed in the city and she 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
4
  
 
 
had to run away because they were searching 
for remaining Jews. So, that™s when she left 
me with that Gentile lady. So, I was 
six years old, little bit over six, yeah. 
Q: And I had a question -- two questions, act
ually, the first one being, do you know -- do 
you understand now and did you 
understand then, why your mo ther left you alone? 
A: It™s such a interesting question. Di
d I understand? I -- Obviously, I mu st have 
understood something when she said, ﬁYou have
 to stay here. I mu st leave with your 
sister. But,ﬂ she said, ﬁin the spring, some
one will come to get you and bring you to me, 
wherever I™m going to be.ﬂ A-And as mu ch 
as I didn™t like the thought that my  mo ther 
was leaving, a-and I was, you know, I was cr
ying and my  excuse was, ﬁMama,ﬂ I says, 
ﬁbut I have a headache.ﬂ Cause I felt, maybe if
 I tell her I have a headache, she will stay. 
And she said to me, she said, ﬁThe lady w
ill give you an aspirin, and you™ll feel better. 
And here.ﬂ She gave me a hundred rubles, she says, ﬁIn case you want to buy yourself 

something and you need money.ﬂ So she gave
 me the hundred rubles and she kissed me 

goodbye, she walked out. Now -- She walked out
, I -- I guess there was something that I 
mu st have understood when she said, ﬁI mu st
 go, and I can™t take you along,ﬂ she says, 
ﬁbecause it is too cold outside.ﬂ And -- And i-
in Europe, the winters are extremely cold. 
You can really freeze. And -- And I had very 
little clothing, because that clothing wasn™t 

even mine, it was the clothing that belonged 
to somebody else from the first pogrom yet. 
So, I guess, in the way, I understood that it™s cold outside and I might get sick or freeze 

and my mother said she must leave and I kne
w one thing, that, as a Jew, we had to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
5
  
 
 
escape. So, that was my  understanding, and I di
dn™t make a scene. I just said, ﬁMy head 
hurts.ﬂ That™s all. 
Q: Now, the part two of the question that 
I wanted to ask that I would -- while I was 
watching the video, that I wondered -- now, to 
step way back into the -- well, way up into 
the future from that mo ment, did you ever disc
uss this with your mo ther, about leaving? 

A: Interesting. No. 

Q: Okay. 

A: Never discussed it and I never, ever felt any resentment. As the years went by, I guess 

somebody would say, ﬁOh, Ma, you left me.ﬂ 
or ﬁYou abandoned me.ﬂ I never felt that 
way. And I just never discussed it with her 
and I -- but I did asked her, when we were 
reunited and she held me on her lap -- see, now I remem -- I remember, and my first 

question was, ﬁMama, why did you leave me?ﬂ Th
at I did, yeah. And she just explained 

to me again what she said, ﬁI had to leave, it was too cold and I was afraid if I take you, 

you might freeze to death.ﬂ Cause even the clot
he -- my clothing cons
isted of knee-highs 
and a pair of short boots. A little skirt, a sweater and a little jacket with a scarf, that™s it. 

Q: And your sister was mu ch older than you? 

A: 10 years older. Right, she was already a big girl, so that was different. 

Q: And speaking of the reunion with your mo ther and your sister. Where -- In the 

interview -- we are not quite clear from the 
video interview, what were the conditions, 
where did you live, did you work? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030

A: W-We lived in this very, very small 
town, it was occupied Romania and I understand 
this was still part of the Ukraine, but it wa
s next to Romania and they call it occupied 
Romania. Mostly, there was a handful of Ge
ntile people with a few homes, and -- a-and 
farms -- fields, they had a lot of fields. And 
this handful of Jewish people lived with the 
Gentile families, like we did. We lived w
ith this Gentile gentleman. We were two 
families in one of his rooms, because that™s 
all he had is one room. And -- And he slept 
on top of the brick oven and we had -- yeah, 
our life wasn™t that simple. There was no 
bathrooms, either. If you had to go to the bath
room, you had to go out in the fields. Those 
days, things were not the way they are today.
 And so there was one bed, on -- on that bed 
there was a mo ther and a daughter whose finge
rs were a bit froze -- yeah, frozen from -- 
from the cold -- yeah, fro
m the cold weather. They were tr
ying to hide and wherever they 
hid, they obviously were
 not dressed properly. 
Q: A Jewish mother and -- 

A: Yeah, a Jewish mo ther and a Jew -- and her daughter. So, they slept on one -- it wasn™t 

really a bed, it was one of those four legs
 and -- a-a-and -- and some hay on it, I mean, 
that was the bed. And we had another be
d, which was a little bit bigger, because my 
mother, myself, my sister and then later on, 
a cousin of ours joined us, too. So we all 
slept on the same bed and instead of sleepi
ng horizontally, we slept diagonally. And if 
there wasn™t enough room, so one of us w
ill sleep on the floor. A-And that was o-our 
quarters. Now, what we did is -- is -- we ha
d no money to pay for our -- our rent. So, we 
worked for this gentleman. Of course, we were  very grateful, the fact that he even gave 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
7
  
 
 
us a place where to sleep -- where to sleep. 
So, we worked on his -- on his fields and I 
was one of his workers, and my  job was to -- 
with my  fingers, I would have to dig out the 
potatoes from -- you know, from under the earth. A
nd I cleaned them up, put them in a 
sack and tied the sack and then, you know, just
 so -- drag it to his warehouse, which I 
don™t know how many blocks it was exactly, I neve
r counted it. To me, it was just part of 
my  life. And for that, he would give me a loaf
 of black bread. So, we didn™t have to pay 
for the rent and he gave me a loaf of
 bread and that was a tremendous salary. 
Q: How often did you get bread? 
A: Well, every day. I wor -- I worked every day.
 And so did, of course, my  sister and my  
mother and my cousin. We all worked for hi
m. Well, they -- they 
worked in different 
parts of the field and I worked, you know, digging up the potatoes with my  hands, my  

bare hands, yeah. 

Q: Do you rememb er what -- what -- what they did? 

A: What -- I™m sorry? 

Q: What your mo ther and sister did? 

A: Oh, they were also working on the fields. 
Well, they must have -- they -- may -- may -
- maybe they did different, you know, diggings
, different, whatchamacallit, vegetables, 

you know, also it was -- everything was diggi
ng up, you know, because like he did the 
seeding and then, you know, y -- and you would have
 to -- in the springtime, that™s what 
you did. In springtime, everything was growi
ng and you had to rip it off of, or rip it out 
of the ground and bring it into his warehouse. So
 we were all just working on the fields.

Q: But you were not in hiding at this time? 
A: No. At that time, it was not a question of
 hiding, because there was no ghetto, this was 
not a ghetto. You wo -- just would have to be
 very careful if sometimes a German would 
pass by in the street, you understand? Or -- Or
 someone, some other Gentile would know 
that you were Jewish, he might just go to 
the German and tell them, you know, in this 
house, they have Jews. So, actually, we 
were hiding out and 
nobody was supposed to 
know that we are Jews, except for the person w
ith whom we lived, he knew that we were 
Jewish. So, that™s how it worked. 

Q: Was he -- What would have been his motivation, was -- was it political, was it -- was 

it a spiritual motivation? Was it circumstantial? 

A: To say -- Do you mean to hol -- to hide
 out Jews? Well, there were some good people 
and he mu st have been one of those people 
wh-wh -- who felt sorry for a mother and her 
children and he also felt, you know, that we™ll 
be devoted and loyal. We™ll -- We™ll work 
for him, we™ll help him out, because after all,  he was all alone. And at the same time, he 

was, you know, saving lives. And that™s -- That
 was really something very, very amazing 

and very important to us. 

Q: That sort of reminds me a -- a little bit of
 what I™m reading about the -- the slaves in 

America and how there were certain homes, wh
en they were on their way from the south 
to the north -- 

A: Took them in. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
9
  
 
 
Q: -- where they stayed, I wondered, just ju
mp ing way into the future, did you have a -- 
make a connection with the Civil Rights moveme
nt at all, or the story of slavery in 
America? 
A: You mean, at the present time, connecti
ng their past and my  past? Well, you know, in 
those years, in my -- my times -- you™re talk
ing 55 years ago, there was no such thing as 
Civil Rights, there wa-was only such a 
thing as good people versing not such good 
people. And he was one of 
those top people, who -- all he knew was perhaps for -- 
because of his belief, that God said, you know, 
you should help others 
and that™s what he 
was doing. And the mere fact that he took us 
in, he mu st have been very special and -- 
and -- and obviously a believer too, in saving lives. So, you know, things were different 

then, as they are today, or -- 

Q: Do you have any idea how your mo ther found him? 

A: No, but I am sure my mother was someth
ing very special. She was someone who was 
always ahead of everyone. And I imagine she 
just found out abis -- about this gentleman 
that, you know, lived alone and she mu st have approached him and -- and offered, you 

know, our services and he accepted them. So we are very lucky. 

Q: Now, from there I would love to -- whoa. 

A: That™s the airport. We™re not that far from the airport. 

Q: Oh. From LaGuardia? 

A: You see -- no, JFK. You hear that noise? 

Q: Yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
10
  
 
 
A: Every time -- This is not too bad, but ever
y time, could be in the mo rning, could be 
during the day, could be in the evening, 
suddenly there will be a tr-tremendous noise 
coming from the airport and I think it™s from the 
airport, from that direction, and that will 
bring horrible memories to me and I sometim
es just shake and I can™t do anything until 
this noise stops. That reminds me, after the lib
eration, when we came back to Proscurov, 
to our home, every night for a whole year, un
til ‚45, the German planes, 30 or 40 of them 
would come over every night and bombard the 
city. And so, we would hear that noise, f-
from those planes approaching us and then, of
 course, either we -- if we had enough time, 
we would run to shelters and if we didn™t, 
we would just lie on the floors and -- and our 

ho -- our glass, you know the windows would be
 open and we would have tapes on them, 
that th-the -- the glass should not shatter 
and we would lie under our beds until they 
finished bombarding and they left. This is how I lived. 

Q: Wa -- That™s interesting that that plane w
ould give us a cue, cause what -- one thing I -
- I know we want to know about, is at the 
exact time of liberation, because you briefly 
mentioned it in the video interview and late
r you say that you never really felt liberated. 
A: Mm-hm. 

Q: And I wondered, for a mo ment, if we mi
ght focus on your experience of the -- the 
exact moment of liberation are -- are -- and th
en the few days after that, from a child™s -- 

how old were you? 

A: I was, at that time, eight. Eight years old,
 that was in 1944. And, actually the Russians 
liberated us, okay, the Russian army. And ther
e was -- it was really horrible, because for 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
11
  
 
 
a day and night, there was door to door fighti ng between the Russian soldiers and -- and 
the Germans. And, course the following day, wh
en -- when we realized that we were free, 
that -- I ran into the house -- to that -- to 
our room, where that lady with her daughter 
were and these poor people, you know, their fi
ngers were all frostbitten and well, while 
they were there, I used to go in the fields 
and look for a special leaf. There was a special 
leaf which, when you would put to the infected
 area, that at least alleviated their pain. 
Cause, you see, we could not get to a doctor 
and we were not allowed to go to a hospital 
and nobody was supposed to know that we were 
Jews. So, we couldn™t call for help to 
help that mo ther and daughter who were cons
tantly in excruciating pain because those -- 
that area where the fingers fell off, was just
 closing and half -- it wasn™t completely 
closed. So -- So I was told that if I can find t
hose type of leaves in the fields, then they 
would put it in -- o-on the affect -- in -- affect -- infected area and -- and that would 

alleviate their pain. So, I used to do that. 
But then, when we were
 told that we are 
liberated, we are free, we don™t have to be afraid, well, I ran in -- you know, I was in the 

street and I ran in to give them the good 
news. And I was so happy, I was jump ing and 
this poor lady, now I understand, you know, how
 she felt. Then, I couldn™t understand. 
She took a broom and she started hitting me. 
And she said to me, ﬁWhat is there to 
rejoice?ﬂ Because she and her daughter, they 
were really cripples. And -- And I was 
jump ing for joy, so she beat me up with a broom. And she said, ﬁWell, there™s nothing to 

rejoice about.ﬂ I says, ﬁBut we don™t have -- the Germans are gone, the Germans are 

gone.ﬂ She said, ﬁOh. So?ﬂ And that was th
at, you know, and I just walked out of the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
12
  
 
 
house, because I was afraid she will beat me 
up some more, so that was that. Then, we 
also ran to see the first Russian airplane th
at landed in that -- in our little town. And it 
was on the hill and it was very big and I was so
 happy to see this big plane, because when 
I was little and I would go with my father for walks and I would see an airplane in the 
sky and I would say, ﬁPapa, how does this plan
e fly?ﬂ And he would say, ﬁThere is a man 
in it.ﬂ And I would say, ﬁBut it™s so small, 
how can a person sit in it?ﬂ And he would say 
to me, ﬁIt seems to you that it -- he™s -- this pl
ane is very small. That™s because this plane 
is so far, far away. But it™s really very, very
 big.ﬂ Well, this was my  opportunity to see 
this big plane on the hill -- course with the -- 
with the Russian soldiers and -- a-and oh, ar 
-- that was a sunny day and oh, I was so happy. 
And then, we heard that this was the day 
that the Germans were planning to kill that ha
ndful of Jews that were hiding out with the 

Gentile people. They had already dug up a d
itch for us. But the Russians came in and 
never gave them a chance to kill us. So, i-i-
it was a tremendous celebration. I remember 
we were just dancing in the street a
nd was just something so very special.  

Q: Did -- The first few days after being lib
erated, did your life change at all? Did you 
continue to be in the -- living in the same place? 

A: Yeah, mm-hm. We lived, I -- I think for a
nother couple of weeks in the same place, 
because A, we had no money to go anyplace, 
we had nothing. So, I -- I -- I just wou -- 
don™t know exactly how my  mo ther got the money. I think what my  mo ther did is 

whatever we had, like even th
e sheets she sold, like if you had them -- we had a sheet and 
maybe a pillowcase and maybe a blanket. She 
must have sold it to the people there and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
13
  
 
 
that™s how she got money for us to take a 
train and go back home. And so, it™s a few -- 
was a few weeks later that we went home to 
Proscurov. And that was in 1944, April of 
1944, spring. 
Q: Before we go too mu ch further, there 
was one mo re question which I thought was 
very interesting and that was, it -- it seemed 
to me when I -- when I listen to you now and 

when I heard your video, considering your ag
e, that your recollection, your ability to 
recall is very, very clear and good and I wonde
red if -- if your mo ther ever helped you 
reconstruct the events that happened during 
wartime, or have you always rememb ered 
clearly, what happened? 

A: Always rememb ered clearly. In fact, when
ever I talk about my  experience, it™s -- it™s 
right here. It™s like I™m watching a movie. Right
 in front of me, there™s a screen and I™ll 
see it all over again. See, I can tell you how 
the sky was. When it was shining, when it 
wasn™t. When it was raining. When we were 
walking -- the first pogrom when they lined 
us up and we were walking towards the outside
 of the city to the slaughterhouse. It was 
cloudy, it was drizzling, it was dreary, it was 
cold and yet, the liberation, it was sunny, 
the sun was shining, the sky was blue. I can re
memb er everything. There just isn™t a thing 
that I don™t. And it™s all just in front of me. Once I talk about it, it™s in front of me. And 

not only when I talk about it. It™s -- My life 
is like a back -- backlash? Backflash -- back -
- 

Q: Flashback? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
14
  
 
 
A: Flashback. Like, I™ll walk in the street and I™ll see -- I™ll -- I™ll hear a German 
Shepherd and that™s -- right away, I got back
 to what has happened to me during those 
years with the German Shephe
rds. When I pass a house that has a -- that looks like -- a 
little like a barn o-or has a barn in back o-of, that brings back memories again. So, every 

movement in my  life and everywhere I go, I see my  past. I see a cat, brings back 

memo ries. Even -- That™s just unbelievable,
 but even, you know, the Germans, the SS, 
their hats. They had these cap
s with like a brim up front, but up front was very high and 
then they had insignia, the in
signia. Sometimes I™ll see someone with a hat similar to that 
and it like takes me aback. Right away, I™ll look at
 that. And, like I told you, th-the plane, 
that noise from the airport, right away I see 
the planes coming. God, there™s just -- just 
about everything brings memo ries. But, ever
ything is very, very clear, from the minute 
that -- when I was in my  kindergarten a
nd I was standing by the window, looking out to 
the backyard and the first bomb fell. Like
 a little -- you know, away from our -- from my 
school, but I was able to see the explosion of it 
and this is when the teachers realized that 
we were in trouble and they all called, you know, th-the parents and the parents came 

running and they took the children home and -- 
and of course, and on 
the radio we heard 
that -- that the Germans invade
d us. So, from that moment on -- 
Q: How old would you have been then? 

A: Oh, I was five years old. 

Q: Okay. I think I better go to side two, be
cause I have a feeling we™re going to have a 
long story coming in liberation. So, we™re now 
moving from tape one, side A, to side B. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
15
  
 
 
End of Tape One, Side A 
Beginning Tape One, Side B 
Q: All right, this is tape one of the inte
rview with Frima Laub, side B. And you were 
saying? 
A: And I was saying that, because I was so young 
and this was such an impact on my  life, 
that although perhaps I could not understand exac
tly what a war is, but I knew that I mu st 

survive. This I knew. And I knew that the 
fact that I am a Jew, nobody™s supposed to 
know that. I have to be somebody else. And,
 for awhile, as you know, my  name was not 
Frima, it was Lola. 

Q: No, I didn™t -- 

A: No, it was Olga. I forgot, it was Olga. 

Q: Your name was Olga? 

A: That™s right. During the war, I was not Frim
a. I was -- We had to undertake a different 
-- different names in order for us to be so
mebody else. We were not supposed to be Jews. 
Q: What was your last name? 

A: Oh, now you are asking me for too mu ch. I don™t rememb er. I don™t rememb er what 

our last name was, but we did have, believe 
it or not, we did have false papers, because 
you were not allowed to walk the street, they 
were -- we were all so -- the rosaca -- what 
do we call that? Curfew? Curfew, yeah. A curfe
w, right, in the evening? And if anyone 

was walking, then you had -- an-and ap 
-- you know, and a German would stop you, 
which they had the right to do it. If you show
 them the papers, then they would let you 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
16
  
 
 
go. If you didn™t have papers, they would take
 you in for interrogations. So, we had -- we 
had false papers. And this all -- My mo ther t
ook care on all these things. In fact, we got 
these papers from a church, from a pastor, be
cause my  mo ther realized, after the pogrom 
that they are -- or they were looking for Jews
 and -- and we had no place to go and so that 
means we would be in the streets, trying 
to -- you know, like she was trying to -- to see 
whom and how she would be able to get us wh
ere and how to leave the city. So, we went 
into a church and my  mo ther spoke with a pa
stor and he gave us false papers, yeah. You 
see, I told you there were some good people in 
this world. If not for them, I wouldn™t be 
here talking to you. 

Q: I want to ask you about how you got -- 
if you can recollect, how you got from the 
knowledge of the liberation, then there 
was two weeks with the same farmer -- 
A: Or three weeks -- 

Q: -- and then -- or however -- 

A: Mm-hm. 

Q: -- and then, do you rememb er how you traveled and what -- how you felt when you 

arrived in your next destination? 

A: Home -- hum. Well, let™s see. Of course, those -- the next few weeks are -- just by 

knowing that we don™t have to worry about be ing killed and we don™t have to hide out 

any longer and that we are goi
ng home, but we were not sure if our house will still be 
there, you know, because of all the bombardment
s and all the destructions and especially 

if it™s a Jewish home, of course it was dest
royed quicker than any -- any -- anybody else™s 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
17
  
 
 
home. But the excitement was there, the fact
 that perhaps my father will be there and 
perhaps my brother will be there. So, i-it was 
a mixture of excitement that we were free 
and we were going home and the worry of will 
we see our father again, and will we see 
our brother again, or you know, my  mo the
r™s son. And -- And then, of course, 
[indecipherable] my  mo ther always had ways 
of how to do things and she got that money 
and we got the tickets and we got on that tr
ain and we made it home and it was -- i-it was 
a long trip. It was -- oh, God, I know it was l ong. It was at least six, seven hours of, you 

know, of traveling. 

Q: By train? 

A: By train, right, or maybe even mo re. I 
-- I don™t rememb er exactly. Seems to me like it 
was forever, anyway. And we made it home a
nd sure enough, there was our house. It was 
still there. Course, inside, everything wa
s empty, you know. But -- And outside, it was 
only partially destroyed. Also, obviously fro
m the shootings and bombardments. So -- 
But -- But the fact that the house was there, was a wonderful feeling, and -- and -- and 

then we began to -- to -- to hope that, you know
, the family -- the rest of the family, my  
brother, my father will come home and -- but no,
 it didn™t work that way. My mother was 
writing letters all over, you know, and the neighbors 
said that they did see my  father with 
two Gestapos, walking in the street and th at was the last time they saw him and nobody 

knew whatever, what happened to my  father. 
So we -- After awhile -- After, you know ri 
-- writing to different places and not getting a
ny response, we knew that we™ll never see 
him again. And my  brother, well, he was writi
ng to us also. See, after the war, he also 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
18
  
 
 
began to write home, and we got his letters. 
And so this is how we, you know, started to 
corresponding and then he came home. 

Q: Now tell me about how long was it and about
 his -- his coming home. You mu st really 
recall that.  

A: Yeah. Well, first of all, wh-when we got hi
s letter that he was alive, we were dancing. 
I mean, it was just wonderful. He is -- was 
the only brother, the oldest brother, the one 
and only. And we haven™t seen him in -- in th
ree -- more than three 
years, I mean, almost 
four years. And so the fact that, you know, 
that he was alive and th -- he would be 
coming home and so also, you know, my  mo ther, my  mo ther, my  aunt, they write papers 

and you know, there was always a lot of paper -- 
a lot of paperwork, but it worked and he 
came. He was terribly handsome, my  brot
her, so good looking. Tall, blonde, very good 
and very intelligent and he was, ah, it was ju st so wonderful to see him and -- we thought, 

you know, maybe he was in contact with our 
father, we just, you know, tried everything. 
But no, it just didn™t work out that way. A
nd then, you know, and my  sister, my  brother, 
they went out to work. My mother went out 
to work and in between she would fix up the 
-- the house outside, they made it look real 
nice. And we always had an open door for 
those who needed a place to sleep over. Even
 we didn™t have many beds, but there was 
always the floor, so they could sleep 
on the floor. And whoever needed, you know, a 
meal or something, well our meal consis
ted of potato soup and 
that -- potato soup, 
herring and some black bread and that was ve
ry good. We did very, very well. Little by 
little, you know, we had the bed and my mother 
couldn™t even afford to buy shoes for me, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
19
  
 
 
so I would go to the bombed out homes -- hous
es and look for rope. And then, separate 
the rope and my  mo ther bought me a crochet 
needle and I would crochet slippers. And I 
would take a cardboard, cut out the sole, put it 
inside and that was my  shoes. And then 
later on, of course, I -- my  mo ther registered me to s -- in school and she had to buy me a 
pair of shoes. So, she bought one pair of 
shoes and I had one uniform and I went to 
school in the afternoon and in the mo rning my
 job was, course, to clean up the house and 
make the beds, prepare lunch for my  family, 
and they u-used to come home for lunch. 
And I washed my  own uniform and I did my
 own pressing and every day you had to go 
to school with -- with a pressed up blouse, th
e blouse was always pressed. And my  shoes 
that my  mo ther bought me and then when I 
ca -- came home, I would take off the shoes 
that she bought me and put on my  shoes, the 
ones that I crocheted. Hand crochet shoes. 
Q: Was this a school of Jewish and Gentile children? 

A: This was a public school. There were hardly 
any Jews. We were just about, I think, the 
only family that survived.  

Q: Did you feel prejudice there? 

A: Well, prejudice was always there. Anti-Se
mitism always existed. Persecution always 
existed, so I guess, from a very young age, 
I learned that strangers shouldn™t know who 
you are. And I did very well in school and my eah -- 

Q: Okay, we -- we cannot change the nei ghbors activities, so we™re going to move on. 

And I wanted to ask Frima, how long were you 
there, in your home, and what was it that 
made you move on? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
20
  
 
 
A: Okay, we were home for about two years. 
But before that -- before the two years of 
the -- again, I -- I went to school, I did very well, my  mo ther was very proud of me. My 
mother received a letter from the government, 
the city government, that our house is too 

bi-big just for one family, 
so they were planning on havi
ng two other families moving in, 
to live with us. With that, my  mo ther de
cided that it™s time to go. And although it was 
extremely difficult to le-leave the country a
nd the city and the home and -- and whatever 

she worked for, she felt th
at this was the time to leave. A
nd so she again, as smart as my 
mo ther was, she again made all kinds of arra
ngements, got in contact with certain people 

who helped us get the right papers in order to leave the country. And that™s what we did 

and that™s where we started our journey 
from the Ukraine to Po
land, from Poland to 
Germany, from Germany to France, from France
 to Cuba, from Cuba to the United States 
of America and God bless America.  

Q: So, how long did that take? 

A: To me it took forever. Is so mu ch the trip. But -- 

Q: And you were how old when you were -- 

A: Well, when I arrived in -- in -- [indeciphera
ble] in Cuba, because I lived in Cuba nine 
years. So, the age when I arrived in Cuba, I 
was 13. In fact, I can show you some -- some 
leaflets that -- I used to entertain. I -- I 
had a very good voice and my  aunt was very mu ch 

involved -- my  aunt, who brought us to C
uba, she was very mu ch involved and -- you 
know, in the Jewish organizations. And th-tha
t was for her a chance to raise money for 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
21
  
 
 
her organization, by running a 
dinner dance, having her niece who just came from the -- 
from Europe singing all kinds, of
 course, Holocaust songs.  
Q: Now, I want you to hold this -- this thought
, is if we™re trying to see where you were 
before. Those places where you were, you menti
oned, but I™d like to go into a little more 
detail -- 
A: More details? 

Q: -- about anything you recall, 
especially in Paris, and -- 

A: Okay, well, Paris was my  last stop, so you want to -- 

Q: So let™s --  

A: Let™s start from Poland -- 

Q: Yes. 

A: -- to Germany. 

Q: Yes. 

A: All right. 

Q: Your -- Your time in Germany, did you m
ove from place to place? Did you settle for 
long? How did you travel? 

A: Okay, we are now right, okay. Okay, our 
first stop was Poland, where we -- we were 
there only for about a day, or maybe a day 
and a half and then by train we went to 
Germany. No, excuse me -- yes, but before 
that, we had to cross borders, okay? We -- 
Yes, we did take a train from the Ukraine to 
Poland, that is correct. Then in Poland we 
stayed maybe a day or a day and a half, ri ght. And then from -- from Poland, we had to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
22
  
 
 
cross a border to Germany. Now, it is illegal,
 in those days, it was illegal to cross the 
borders, unless you had, of course, all the ri ght papers, or whatever. Well -- And, of 
course, you cannot be Jewish, either. And that™s 
already, even after the war. But, what my  
mo ther did is -- there were always peopl
e who for money would smuggle you, okay? And 
we were not the only ones, there were many 
Jewish people that wanted to get out of 
Poland and wanted to, you know, sort of run to
wards Germany or even Italy, wherever 
they were able to go and with the hope that
 from there, they w
ill come to the United 
States or go to Palestine or go to, you know
, different countries. So, this was -- the 
arrangement was a --a military truck, who 
was not -- who was -- did not belong to the 
military any longer, it belonged to
 those group of men, two or
 three of them, who would 
smuggle people for X amount of money. 
And so, you know, you had to pay for each 
head, whatever it was and I rememb er so di
stinctly, this was this -- you know, th-those 

military trucks that have canvas on top? 
You know, those canvas trucks, right? And we 
must have been maybe 25 - 30 people, with
 little children, okay? Some were sitting on 
the side, you know, the benches on the side. Most
 of us were lying on the floor and -- and 
-- and people were sitting on top 
of those who were sitting -- who were lying on the floor. 
And when we got to the border, it was -- 
the guards stopped us and I -- we don™t know 
what our driver told him, but th-the guard
s decided to check what -- what they were 
carrying in that -- in -- in that truck, right? 
So, as they started walking to the back, to 
open up the canvas and see what material they
 were carrying, our driver took off. And 
they started shooting at us. And he was zigza
gging and we were not hit. Were we lucky? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
23
  
 
 
I™m lucky all the time. And we made it to Ge
rmany, okay? Now, we arrived in Germany, 
it was dark. And there was a -- see, once you™re
 in Germany, they knew that these Jews 
were displaced persons. So they -- no problem
, they would just -- you know, ha -- we had 
to fill out papers, they would register us, w
ho we are, blah, blah, blah and they would -- 
and -- an-and they was send us to Berlin. Ber
lin was like the headquarters for all the Jews 

that were coming from all over the world and from -- from Berlin, they would send us to 

different displaced person camps -- DP camps 
they were called. So, all over Germany, 
they had these DP camps, okay? Our camp  was 
in Bavaria, part of Bavaria. And -- And 
the city -- the name of the city was Poking, 
but our camp  was outside of Poking, our DP 
camp, which wa -- there were like -- there were wooden barracks and I don™t know if 

these barracks were built after the war or they
 were there before the war, I really don™t 
know. And -- But after the war, I found out that
 actually these barracks were built on top 
of a Jewish children cemetery. Jewish child
ren were buried there. They were killed 
during the war, they were buried there a
nd then these barracks were built, you know, 

before we arrived. 

Q: How did you find that out? 

A: Well, somebody that -- that was in that area told me, a-a-and I was -- I was shocked, 

because I -- I didn™t know -- none of us really 
knew. So, what happened, so we lived in 
that area and in that DP camp, I don™t know how many of us were -- but I do know that 

the mu seum has a picture of one of the barracks behind me and my  sister. That was my  

school and that was also our entertainment buildi
ng. We used -- I used to entertain, I used 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
24
  
 
 
to sing. And there were children who danced
 and this was our school and this was our 
social hall. 
Q: To entertain each other? 

A: To entertain, yes -- 

Q: And -- And how did you start your interest
 in singing, was it here at the DP -- 
A: At -- Wh -- Yeah, yeah, at the DP camp, right 

Q: Did you by any chance sing when you we
re young, by yourself, because you spent so 
much time alone. 

A: Well no, I -- those were not the times for 
me to sing, when I knew that I™m all alone. 
Q: And when did you start singing? 

A: After the war, when I came home. 

Q: So, part of your liberation is, in a way was -- 

A: Yeah, probably you are right, yes, probably 
that was the reason. Yeah, come to think 
about it. 

Q: Not to mention your talent 

A: Well, I had -- No, I had a good reason to sing then, you know? 

Q: And your sleeping arrangement in the ba
rracks, were you separated the women and 
the men, and -- 

A: Oh, no, no, no, no, no. We had one room
 and we as a family, a whole family, you 
know the four of us, yeah, all four of us, y
eah, my  -- well, m-my  father wasn™t with us 
any longer. That™s my  brother, my  sister, my se
lf and my  mo ther, right. We had one room 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
25
  
 
 
and you know, every family had a room. It was 
very -- That was very good. This is where 
the HIAS and Joint came in and they helped 
us. HIAS? It™s the Hebrew -- Hebrew, God, 
the HIAS, how they -- they sp
ell it? Well they, it™s H-I-A-S. That™s an organization that 
provides people who are need of food and cl
othing, they provide them. And also the 
Joint. That™s J-o-i-n-t, Join
t. They also an -- are an organization that provide, you know, 
the refugees and the Displaced Person with f
ood and clothing, cause 
none of us had jobs 
and we had to eat. And so, whatever we got, 
it was no big deal, but it still was food, and -
- and clothing. And -- 

Q: Your family worked on -- 

A: There was nothing to work, there 
are no jobs for us. We had no jobs. 
Q: No jobs for money, but I m
ean, what did you do during the day? 
A: Oh, oh well, you know, my  mo ther would 
help out the sick people, somebody was 
sick. I went to school. Right away a school was set up. In every DP camp  there was a 

school and we went to school. We would -- 
We were taught Jewish, Hebrew and the 
language of the country, yeah. And la -- as 
I said, and -- and the schoolchildren we used 
to entertain, like once a week, we would ha
ve -- you know, for the parents and the whole 
DP camp would come and we would entertai
n, singing and danci
ng and you name it and 
we did all these things. We also, you know, 
we had all kinds of competitions, bicycle 
riding and running and jump ing a
nd you name it, I mean we -- they kept us really busy. 
Yeah, it was -- 

Q: Do you have pleasant memo ries of that time? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
26
  
 
 
A: They were pleasant because I didn™t ha
ve to worry about pogroms and I was not 
surrounded by barbed wires and I -- and I di
dn™t have -- I didn™t hear the German 
Shepherds bark. So, that was like feeling I™m safe. 
Q: Who were the leaders? Do you rememb er the leaders of the DP camp s? 

A: No, no. 

Q: So, is there any other thought or experience 
you had there, before -- in Bavaria, before 
we move on to the next place? 

A: Yeah, well, a-a-after this -- a-after Shl
upfing and that™s the DP, my first DP camp 

where we stayed, they suddenly decided to close this DP camp  and they moved us to 

another DP camp, not too far, you know, a fe
w kilometers from this one, which was a 
much larger one and the name of that camp was 
Volshtadt. It was also in Bavaria. So, we 
stayed in the first camp like, I think, a year
 or so and -- and the same amount of time in 
the other camp, until -- well, time came when th
ey said, ofka -- of course, you have to 
move on. Okay, so -- 

Q: How did they decide that? 

A: Well, usually what everyone tried to do is 
get in touch with their f-families or relatives 
in whichever country they had relatives and th
e relatives would have the papers ready for 
them. Like, we had papers to come into 
the United States, except, when we got from 
Germany to France, from where we were supposed
 to come to the United States, we were 
supposed to wait longer on that quota th-th-th
e am -- the American quota was very slow. 
I imagine they had maybe a lot of people. So we had to wait. And my  mo ther -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
27
  
 
 
Q: Now how did -- You -- You™ve gotten to the second DP camp? 
A: Right. And we lived there for about a year. 

Q: One year. 

A: Yeah. Continued going to school. I also, 
in between, would help out mo thers with 
little children like I was a babysitter. I mean, free of charge, you know. And we had 

synagogue who caught fire and you know, because
 these were old barracks, they were 
dried pieces of wood put together, huts really. I 
mean that™s -- that™s what it was. But we 
knew it was temporary and everything, youknow, comp ared to what we had to go 

through during, you know, during the pogroms, th
is was fine. And so we were looking 
forward that, you know, tomorrow will be a 
better tomorrow. And sure enough, the 
tomorrow came where we had to take 
the train from Munich to Paris. 
Q: Now did you stay in Munich at all, or just passing through? 

A: No, we -- we just went to Munich to take 
the train to Paris and we did and we lived in 
a rooming house. I don™t think it was a hotel, 
I think it was a rooming house. We had one 
room. We lived there for five months. 

Q: Did an organization pay for your -- 

A: You see, I don™t rememb er. I think it was 
a comb ination between the organization and 
my  family in the United States who send us
, you know, send money and packages at that 
time, you understand? They were also helpi
ng us out. So, I don™t -- You know, I -- I -- I 
can™t say if they were going to say if the or
ganization paid for our stay comp letely or it 
was half and half. But, whichever way it was, 
they were always there if we needed help. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
28
  
 
 
This -- This I do rememb er. Everyone said
, you know, if we need -- you need help, you 
go to the HIAS or you go to the Joint and th
ey will help you, and -- and I imagine they 
did. 
Q: What language were you speaking then? 

A: Well, when I wasn™t in -- in Germany, 
of course I -- I spoke Russian and I spoke 
Yiddish and I spoke Hebrew and I spoke a little  German and I hated the language. Course 

a lot of things also happened in Germany. 
I -- I -- I -- I don™t know how I got it, but one 
evening, the night of Yom Kippur, I was s
itting outside the synagogue
 and I suddenly got 
this terrible headache. I came home and I was running an -- a very, very high 

temp erature. And my  mo ther called a doctor and he came and he examined me and he 

said that immediately they have to take me 
in by ambulance to outskirts of -- of Berlin, 
because I am very sick and I might have dipht
heria and that™s a contagious disease. So, 
can you imagine? Here I am, I thought I was finished with Germany, but here I am sick 

and they taking me with a German ambul
ance to a hospital on the outskirts -- 
Q: From? 

A: Berlin. Outskirts of Berlin -- 

Q: Wh -- 

A: From Berlin -- From the DP camp  in Berlin.  I mean, yes, you know -- 

Q: Let™s go to the next tape. We™re going to fini
sh the story, but I need to change tapes. 

We™re going to Frima Laub, tape two, side  A. 
End of Tape One, Side B

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
29
  
 
 
Beginning Tape Two, Side A 
Q: This is a United States Holocaust Memo
rial Museum interview with Frima Laub, 
conducted by Ginger Miles, on Novemb er 23rd, 
1998. This is tape number two, side A. 
Tell us where we are, because we started with this story -- 
A: Right now, we are ou -- we are back in
 Berlin, in the DP camp. This is -- 
Q: The third DP camp? 

A: No, the first DP camp. I™m -- The reason I™m going back is because I want to tell you 

that I got sick, okay? Yeah, okay? How™d it ever  go back to us -- but anyway, this is just 

a reminder as to what happened to me, while 
we were in -- in -- in Berlin -- in the 
Displaced Person camp in Berlin, after we a
rrived from Poland, and after we cross the 
border to Germany. We were there for a s
hort while, but during that time, the night 
before Yom Kippur, I suddenly was -- was h
it with a terrible headache, while sitting 
outside the synagogue and listening to the pray
ers. And my  mo ther called the doctor and 
he immediately ordered a -- an ambulance to 
take me to a German hospital outside of 
Berlin, because I was very sick, and what I 
had was diphtheria, which is a contagious 

disease. And so, three weeks I was in that hos
pital, in isolation and I did not sleep and I 
did not eat, because I was afraid they™ll kill me
 again. And I -- I was not allowed to have 
visitors, so my  mo ther would come and st
and by the window and just wave to me. And 
every time they gave me an injection, I woul
d say, ﬁThis is it. They killed me.ﬂ And I 
was afraid to eat, because in case there™s poi
son in it. All because I knew I™m a Jew. I 
don™t know if they knew I was Jewish, but obviously they did know that I™m Jewish 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
30
  
 
 
because they took me by ambulance from the DP
 camp. And the only people that went to 
the DP camps, were the Jews. So, after that, we 
went to the next DP camp and then to the 
next one, the third one, which was Volshtadt, 
and then from Volshtadt, we went to -- to 
Munich, to catch the train to Paris. 
Q: Okay, now before we -- 

A: And here, we™re on our way to Paris. 

Q: Before we get on our way to Paris, just be
cause this is so fresh in your mind, has your 
fear of Germans or the German language ca
rried on through to your life to this day? 
A: Absolutely. And -- 

Q: Could you talk a little bit about that? 

A: Yes. Well, the language brings memories and many times I just -- I-I-I™ll just -- I™ll 

sort of cover my  ears, not to hear the language, because it -- it brings memo ries in the -- 

and I really get very upset. I -- I -- I -- I -- I never felt really, comp letely free, you know, 

a-away. So, when I lived in Ge
rmany, there was still fear inside of me that, if they know 
that I am a Jew, something might happen to me, or they™ll do something to me. And to 

this day, it didn™t change. And the German Sh
epherd, that dog, when I hear him bark, I 
don™t even have to see him. Terrible feeling. 
I -- I-I-It™s very hard to end -- to -- to even 
explain. It™s like my -- my stomach jumps. My heart starts racing. 

Q: I never heard anyone speak about German
 Shepherds. How were they involved in 
your history? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
31
  
 
 
A: In my  life? Well, during the first pogrom, wh
en we were rounded up, they came to the 
ghetto, where th -- th -- the SS came with the Ge
rman Shepherds and so, that is to make 
sure that we don™t run or we don™t do anythi
ng, right? I mean, we were helpless anyway, 
because it was very early in th
e morning. It was just beginning to light -- to get light and 
we were sleeping and they started knocki
ng on -- on the windows and on the doors. And 
of course, with that, as they were knocking,
 the German Shepherds were barking. And 
then ho -- all -- a-after we were lined up to go, you know, to the slaughterhouse I call it, 
you know, where they did the killings, on both si
des of the roads, on the road that we 
walked towards the slaughterhouse, they ha d the SS, with the German Shepherds, 

standing there. And so, to me, as I was l
ooking at them, was frightening. And during the 

time that I was alone, and I was walking the str eets, I used to hide between the trees at 

night, when I would go back to the ladies
 house, to sleep under -- under her house, I 
would go between the shadows of the trees,
 I should not be noticed by the German 
Shepherd. Because, you know, they -- they -- if 
they see a shadow, they™ll -- they™ll run 
after a shadow. I was ou -- I tried to be so careful. I-It was unbelievable. And their 

barking just never left me. And the fear of wh
at they can do to you, with their masters, I 
mean, i-is something that did not change my  fe
elings and th-this is unfortunate that -- the 
language -- a-and I would just never go back. 
I keep saying, I would never go back to 
Germany, although sometimes I say I want to 
go back and see the place where I lived, the 
DP camps, but I™m not sure if -- if it™s -- 
you know, what™s there. 
It™s probably nothing, 
it™s a cemetery now.

Q: So you™ve never gone back at all to your -- 
A: No, I just -- 

Q: And what about Paris, since we were about to arrive -- 

A: Well, Paris, I would love to go back, I -- 
I told my  husband I would like to show him -
- I hope that that rooming house is still there,
 where we lived and I would like to show it 
to him. 

Q: And so, in Paris, you didn™t need to know French? 

A: Oh yes, I learn quickly, a little bit of French. I -- Of course, I did not go to school, 

because this was in the middle of the semest
er, so nobody would take me, but I kept very 
busy. I did learn, you know, I had to go shoppi
ng for my  mo ther, I did learn important 
things. 

Q: And the money, I -- 

A: And how to travel. 

Q: And your money came from? 

A: My aunts. Rememb er I told you my  aunts and then, you know, my  mo ther, every so 

often, would sell something else that we had, and -- 

Q: Your aunts in Cuba? 

A: I had an aunt in Cuba and twins in the Unite
d States, yeah, so they -- they really, all of 
them helped us and th-that was very important
, because none of us were able to work for 
five months in -- in, you know, in Paris. But,  we did do a lot of volunteer work. I, for 

example, would babysit for -- for the young c
ouples with children, all sort -- you know, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
33
  
 
 
immigrants. They were in transit from Pari
s to somewheres, okay? And -- And if the 
mo ther wasn™t feeling well, I would take care on the baby. You know, I was like a 
babysitter or a mother™s helper. Then, onc
e a week, there was a -- a -- a group of 
Moroccan Jews that lived on a hill and I don™
t remember the name of the hill, also, 

outskirts of Paris. And I learned quickly, how
 to travel by Metro and I would go all over 

Paris. I knew exactly where I had to go. And of
 course, as I said, I learned the necessary 
vocabulary that I needed -- 

Q: By now you were -- 

A: -- to -- to get around. 

Q: -- you were a big girl. 

A: Yeah, I was 12 years old, that™s correct. 
Almost ready to get married. And I would -- I 
would collect clothing from different people a
nd I would go to the bakeries and collect 
breads and cakes and pick up two valises a
nd go to these Moroccan  people and bring 
them food and clothing. And was bit heavy 
because there were maybe -- maybe, oh, I 

don™t know, maybe 50, maybe 60 people, I don™
t know how many, i-it -- and they lived 
like in a cave. It wasn™t even a house. It looked like a cave. And, of course, you mu st 

understand, not everyone was lucky to have  a bed or a shower. So, I don™t know how 

long these people were living there, but they de
veloped an odor that when I used to come 
to the hill, before I even wa
lked up, I -- I -- I held my breath. And then I would walk up 
and leave the two valises in front of the entran
ce and run away. That -- That™s what I did, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
34
  
 
 
for five months. So -- And my mother di
d other volunteer work and my  sister did 
volunteer work and my  brother did volunteer work, you know, whatever. 

Q: What encouraged you to do volunteer work, your mo ther? 

A: Yeah, my  mo ther always did things. 
Our home was always open, we always had 
people coming, going. We had a large table a
nd the middle of the table, there was that 
summervar -- the summervar. You know what 
a summervar is? It™s that Russian, big 
coffee pot or teapot. That™s summervar, a
nd with glasses and -- and we always had 
people coming and my  mo ther always baked a cookie, a -- you know, and fruits and 

people would have a -- a glass of tea, not a c
up of tea. So -- And -- And this thing was, 
you know, with coal -- coal inside and that 
what made the water hot, and -- so it -- i-it 
was an open house and -- and after the war, it was also an open house. Rememb er I told 

you, whoever needed some potato soup, well, 
had a meal in my  house and -- and if they 
needed a place to sleep, well, there weren™
t enou -- there weren™t enough beds, but we 
had a floor, so no problem. M -- 

Q: I™m going to ask you something about your
 comment. I know you were just making it 
lightly, but when you said you were 12 and you 
were almo st ready to get married, does 
that mean you were starting to get interested in boys here? 

A: No, I™m just kidding you. 

Q: Oh, okay. So did you have any so
cial life? Who did you [indecipherable] 
A: No. In Paris? None whatsoever, nothing.
 What we did in Paris is, you know, I would 
take my mother to the Eif-Eiffel Tower, and we
™ll go to Pigall, to the street of Pigall, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
35
  
 
 
there was a lot of entertainment there. I woul
d walk -- of course I couldn™t afford to go 
into the opera, but I would walk from where I lived, just to stand there and look at this 
magnificent building, the opera. So, no, we 
-- you know, like every day, I would take my  
mother someplace else and we would just
 go and look, you know, and I remember the 
whole family one day, we went to Marseille
s. That was very nice. You know, we kept 
busy. You know, I was never bored, no. 

Q: But basically, you were there, sort of waiting to move? 

A: Yeah, exactly. We knew it was -- We were -- It was just sort of a hop over place, you 

know? And after the five months that we were
 in France, we -- we went to Cannes -- oh, 
well, as I said, I™m jump ing. We were suppos
ed to go to the United States from Paris, 
except that the quota was delayed and -- 

Q: Quota? 

A: Yeah, quota. There was always a quota. And my  mo ther heard that there is going to be 

a World War Three, and so she became panicky and she said, ﬁWe mu st leave Europe 

immediately.ﬂ So, she had a sister in Cuba. She call -- you know, she wrote to her a letter, 

and my  aunt, you know, did whatever she was ab
le to do, which wa -- it wasn™t easy to 
come to Cuba, but my  aunt again, you know, pa
id whatever had to be paid and made the 
right papers and we went from Paris to Ca
nnes and we took a boat, a commercial boat. 
Q: In France? 

A: That -- In France, yeah that
 -- that™s the Riviera, okay, the area of Riviera, which I 
don™t know them, because again, we went th
ere at night. But this is from where the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
36
  
 
 
commercial -- a Polish commercial ship was le
aving and we were the passengers on that 
ship. And for three weeks we were
 on that ship, going to Cuba.  
Q: Do you rememb er it -- the other people you shared it with, or you -- it doesn™t look 
like it was a pleasant experience. 

A: No, because it was a commercial ship, I th
ink we were the only family, maybe there 
were a few other single people. Not going to 
Cuba, they were just working on -- on that 
ship. We were the only ones who went to C
uba. But that ship made a stopover in Cuba, 
either picking up cargo or -- or delivering so
mething. And this is how we wind up going 
with this commercial ship. A, because I don™
t know i-i-if there were any luxury ships 
going from France to Cuba and B, if there we
re, we probably couldn™t afford them. So, 
this was the next best thing. Course, it was -- 
it was a very hard trip. I mean, i-i-it™s not a 
luxury ship and we were all the way on th
e bottom there, in the cabins. And -- A-

Although I wasn™t sick, my  sister was sick all the time, my  mo ther was pretty good, my  

brother was pretty good. And --  

Q: How did you eat? 

A: -- it seemed like forever. Well, we didn™t eat much, there wasn™t much
 to eat, but there 
was bread and there was butter and there was m ilk and there was fish, I think, yeah fish. 

And that was fine. I mean, yes -- couldn™t r
eally starve, a hard boiled eggs, I mean, you 
know, you -- a fruits, looks -- they didn™t feed like it™s a luxury boat. You have to 

understand, to me this was already luxury 
comp ared to my  life before. This was 
wonderful. But, the sea was rough and -- a-and three weeks is a long time when it™s not 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
37
  
 
 
really the right type of a boat, you know, to tr
avel such a long time. But, we made it and 
it was a beautiful day when we arrived in Ha
vana. It was beautiful. It was sunny like this 
and then when we came out on the deck 
and we looked down in that little launcher, 
which is a little boat, there were my aunts, 
waving to us, oh. That was such an exciting 
mo ment in our lives, my  God. These were a unts I didn™t know, cause when they left, I -- I 
was very little and my -- my -- my grandmothe
r, who was their mother, she left,  I was 
six months old, so I -- I -- and of course, sh
e died here, before I came. My -- My dis -- M-
My maternal grandmother died the day after 
we were liberated and she did not know that 
her oldest daughter was alive. Isn™t that sad? 

Q: Your mother? 

A: Yeah, my  mo ther was the oldest daughter
 out of four daughter s and -- and one son. 
She didn™t know. And my  aunts told me that sh e used to pray every day and say, ﬁOh, I 

wonder where my  daughter Eta is with her ch -- 
family. Where is she? Is she al -- Is she 
alive, Is she alive?ﬂ And she died the da
y before. It was so sad. Okay, so -- 

Q: So these aunts were your mo ther™s sisters? 

A: Yes, yes. From my father™s side, ev
erybody was killed. In fact, on Yom Kippur of 
1942, right? ‚42? ‚41? Get me, I think it™s 
‚42 - 1942. The whole town was wiped out. 
The whole town of Volachisk was wiped out
. That included my  grandmother, her sons, 
her only daughter, her grandch
ildren, you know, aunts, uncles, you name it. The whole 
town was wiped out. So, from my  father™s si
de, nobody. We had here a few cousins, my  
father™s few cousins. One is in Israel, one
 was here, she already passed away a long time 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
38
  
 
 
ago. So, all we really had are my mother™s 
sisters and my  mo ther™s brother. And so my  -- 
th-th-the three sisters were in that boa
t, you know, on that little boat, launcher, you know, 
looking up to us while we were on the 
deck waiting, you know, to disembark. 
Q: What are their names? 
A: Oh my , well the oldest one next to my  mo ther is Clara, and she passed away a long 

time ago. A lovely lady. We -- We lived with 
her for awhile until we were able -- she was 
the one who lived in Cuba and she was the one who made us the papers and we lived 

with her until we were able to afford an 
apartment. You know, until my mother went out 
to -- my mother never went out to work, I™m
 sorry. My brother went out to work, my 
sister went out to work and I went out to
 work. Mother™s wouldn™t -- did not work in 
those days, at least not by us. To us, she 
was a mother, and she was a widow and she™s 
not to work. So my  mo ther was a housewif
e and we worked. And then my  other two 
aunts, the -- the other one who is next -- well,
 my uncle wasn™t there, he was in Florida 
and his name is Abraham and he is not here
 any longer, may he rest in peace. And then 
the next sister is Margaret and she passed 
away two years ago and I have just one and 
only little aunt, my mother™s youngest sister
 Elizabeth and she lives in Florida. 
Q: Your mother™s maiden name is? 

A: Is Glaser. 

Q: Glaser. 

A: Yes, yeah. 

Q: Okay. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
39
  
 
 
A: And that is the story -- 
Q: Of Cuba? 

A: No, that™s only the beginning, when we arrived. 

Q: Do you want to take a break? 

A: If you don™t mind. 

Q: No. 

A: Okay. And I™m going to have a cup of
 coffee. How™s that, okay? Is it okay? 
Q: Absolutely. 

A: Yeah, I need some
thing for my throat. 
Q: So we are in Cuba and you were telling 
me when we took a break what -- what you 
did when you were there. When you first 
there and how you learned the language, how 
you worked with a sick aunt and -- 

A: Yeah. Okay, well, when we arrived in
 Cuba, in Havana, it was during middle of 
semester. So, no school would accept me in th
e middle of semester. So, in the meantime, 
I learned the language on my  own, and in thre
e months I spoke Spanish fluently. It truly 
is a lovely, lovely language and lovely, lovely
 people. And we lived with my  Aunt Clara, 
who brought us to Cuba, for about five weeks 
and then my  brother, my  sister, they got 
jobs and we were able to rent an apartm
ent a block away from my  aunt and we moved 
into our own apartment, a one bedroom. And we
ll, after I spoke Spanish, my  cousin who 
is Clara™s daughter, and she™s not with us a
ny longer, Dorothy, she went with me to a 
private school and asked them if they woul
d accept me, since I came from Europe and I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
40
  
 
 
had f-finished six grades in -- no, not six grad
es, I finished about five grades in -- in 
Germany and they were -- after examining me,they were willing to accept me. Now, this 
was a private school of about 45 kids and I wa
s the only Jewish person. And they were so 
enthused with me. And they liked me so mu
ch, of course -- oh, before they took me, 
though, I had to go through exams from first 
grade, all the way to sixth grade. 
Q: In Spanish? 

A: That, absolutely. Okay? And 
that™s when I was accepted to the sixth grade, because I 
was up to par with them. And I was even be
tter in math. I was very, very good in math. 
So -- And, plus the fact that, I-I-I™m a very
 well-behaved girl and I had the honor, and -- 
and I know that a lot of the kids were very jeal
ous and they really resented the fact that I, 
as a Jewish girl, an immigrant coming from 
Europe, I had the honor of holding the Cuban 
flag every mo rning when we sang the C
uban anthem. And after the year -- you know, 

after graduating sixth grade, I graduated with a gold medal. And that was 

[indecipherable] school. Then, I did menti
on to you that my  aunt [indecipherable] 
opportunity of raising money for her organi
zation by running a dinner dance, and so I 
sang, you know, songs from the concentrati
on camp s and songs from the ghettos. And 
my  a -- my  -- my  -- my  cousin Dorothy, her daughter, she would play the piano. 

Q: You sang in Spanish? 

A: I sang in Jewish. There were 
Jewish songs and Hebrew songs. 
Q: Do you  rememb er what -- any one now? 

A: Yeah, well, except I don™t have the voice and if I start singing, I will start crying. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
41
  
 
 
Q: Well, I don™t -- 
A: They™re very sad songs, they really are. 
They™re sad. And wa -- I will just give you the 
title of one of the songs and that™s ﬁP
uppyrosen.ﬂ Puppyrosen in Russian means 
cigarettes. And the song is about a little boy w
ho was left a orphan and -- and -- and he™s 

standing at the corner of a street, trying to
 make some money and it™s windy and it™s cold 
and it™s raining. And he™s asking, ﬁPlease, 
buy this cigarettes, so you can save my  life.ﬂ 

Was a really very sad. So I can™t sing it 
for you. And there were other, you know, very 
sad songs about Jewish survival and atrocitie
s and horrors that -- you know, that we went 

through. But -- 

Q: What are any mo re of the songs? 

A: Huh? 

Q: What other songs? 

A: Oh, let™s see which other so -- oh, there wa -- there was one happy song.  

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: The happy song was, after all these sad s
ongs, it was, ﬁI™m -- I™m going to Israel, and 

I™m saying goodbye to all of you and I™m so ha
ppy that we are finally free and we going 
to the land -- to our Promised Land, and -- a
nd -- oh, and this land is -- is a blessing for 
the Jews and it was promised,ﬂ you know, ﬁby G
od and -- a-a-a-and this -- this land is so 
important to -- a-a-a -- the -- to the Jewish
 nation. It™s like -- a-an -- i-it -- it™s so 
important to -- to -- to the Jewish nations, 
like the right hand is to your body.ﬂ I mean, a-
and there™s other which I -- offhand, I just -- 
I can™t think. Well, anyway, she raised a lot 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
42
  
 
 
of money, because so many people came an-a
nd later on I™ll show you, I have one of 
those flyers that she made out, with my  picture on it. 

Q: She was raising money for Jewish organizations? 

A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, for Jewish or
ganizations and the or
ganizations in Cuba 
which dealt with, you know, children and poor peopl
e, or whatever. No, I need my  thi -- I 
got it, I got it, it™s okay, it™s okay. You know, so -- 

Q: You can stop whenever you want -- 

A: No -- no -- 

Q: -- and have -- have some coffee. 

A: -- that™s okay, that™s fine, no. So that  was that and course, after I graduated my  

Spanish school, I -- I -- I -- I took a job in a factory -- my  cousin in a fac -- 

Q: You graduated from school at what age? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: At -- 

A: At 13 - 13. 

Q: You graduated at 13? 

A: Yeah, 13 I graduated sixth grade. 

Q: Sixth grade. Oh, okay. 

A: That™s it. 

Q: And that™s as far as you went in Cuba? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
43
  
 
 
A: No, no, no. At that time. Then, I -- I -- I 
had -- Took my  -- I had a job and I worked in 
a factory and I was -- I used to pack mercha
ndise and I -- I -- in the shipping department, 
okay? And I would go to school at night. And 
that™s how I continued my  education, by 
going to school at night. And in turn, my  -- my  -- my  aunt got very sick, the one who 
brought us to Cuba, Clara. And she -- she ha
d her kidney removed and -- a-and I felt so 
obligated, you know, to -- to her, for being so
 good to us and bringing us to Cuba and 
setting us up and helping us a
nd -- and buying me things, clothi
ng and all the things that I 
-- I -- I wanted to be her nurse, yeah, so I 
can stay with her until she gets better. And 
luckily, because I stayed
 with her, I discovered that she had diabetes. After surgery, she 
developed diabetes. And how did I detected
 diabetes? Because I would change her 
wound every mo rning. And one mo rning I took 
that sheet and I hung it outside, she had a 

balcony by her window. You know, by her room and 
later on when I went to take it in, I 
saw ants crawling on that area andI knew it had to be sugar, glucose. 

Q: All right, now we™re moving over to the other side of tape two. 
End of Tape Two, Side A 
Beginning Tape Two, Side B 
Q: All right, this is tape two, side B, of 
an interview with Frima Laub. We are in Cuba 
and in the hospital with your aunt. 

A: Yeah, and so when the doctor came, I to
ld him, I says, ﬁYou know, doctor, this and 
this is what happened. And sure enough, when
 they -- after they tested her, they found 
out that she had -- she developed diabetes 
during surgery. Isn™t that something? You 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
44
  
 
 
know, from the shock, many times people develop 
diabetes. Well, I remained with her at 
the hospital 24 hours a day for five weeks, un
til she got better and then she went home. I 
went home and I continued working and actua
lly, I was able to take off from work 
because I worked for her son, her son had th
e factory, so it was no problem. My siblings 
worked. My mother did not work, because in 
those years, and according to our -- our way 
of life, a mo ther should not be working. Her pl
ace is at home, and that™s what we did. My 
mo ther stayed home, she was a housewife a
nd all of us worked and we all, you know, 
chipped in and paid for the rent and we had 
a one bedroom apartment, my  mo ther and I, 

cause at that time already, my sister got 
married and she lived in a different city. 

Q: To a Cuban man? 

A: Yeah, yeah, someone -- 

Q: Jewish? 

A: -- ah, Jewish, yeah. A Jewi -- Cuban Jewi
 -- a Cuban Jew. And -- And my  brother had 
his own place in Havana and my mother and 
I, we lived on the outskirts of Havana, we 
had the one bedroom apartment. And not t
oo far from my  aunt, of course, you know. And 
I -- I had -- I had a lot of friends and I l
oved the Cuban people. And w-we were never 
afraid we would, you know, go out at night a nd walk, one, two o™clock in the mo rning. 

Nobody ever was afraid of anybody, 
everything was very peaceful. 
Q: Who was the leader of Cuba at that time? 

A: At that time, was Batista. Fulgencio Ba
tista. And -- In fact, while talking about 
Fulgencio Batista, a group of us, we were 
-- we had some friends who worked in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
45
  
 
 
Batista™s summer home, Valadero Beach,
 and we were -- you know, we went to 
Valadero, which is very beautiful town near 
the most beautiful beach in the world. We 
went to spend some time by the beach and our 
friends who worked for Batista asked us if 
we wanted to sleep over in Batista™s summe
r home, since the family was away. So we 
did. How about that? Boy, boyo. 
Q: How old were you then? Teenager, right? 

A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: At that time I was already a teenager, but
 to me it was something very exciting, to 
sleep in a president™s house. 
Hey, that was quite an honor. 
Q: Were mo st of your friends and associates Jewish? 

A: Well, where I worked -- you know, later on, 
of course, I changed jobs. 15, I already 
worked -- was it 15 or 16? Probably 16, excuse
 me, at the age of 16, that means three 
years I worked in the factory.
 Then, I -- I -- I worked in a department store as a buyer. I -- 
I had all kinds of friends. I had a Italian fri
end who had a beautiful voice and he sang like 
Mario Lanza. Oh, he had such a beautiful voice. And, of course, we used to sing at all our 

friends weddings. That means we worked -- we 
all worked the same place. So there were 
a few who were getting married. So, when we
 used to go to their weddings, he -- oh, 
what was his name? Ooh. Gino, I think.
 Gino, Gino. We would sing together. 
Q: In Spanish? 

A: Of course, yeah, that was in Spanish. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
46
  
 
 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: Well, we had s -- had Syrian friends. I ha
d Italian friends, I had Cuban friends, I had 
Jewish friends. I also had a -- an Oriental friend. Yeah, I -- I -- I was beautiful. Only, we 

were just -- 

Q: There -- There was a large population of Ch
inese immigrants into Cuba also, wasn™t 
there? 

A: Yes, I would say yes and I™m thinking that 
it was not as large as -- the -- it wasn™t very 
large, because you see, i-it™s a very small c
ountry, a -- really very small, so mostly, 
everyone settle in Havana, so there wa
s, you know, X amount, a small population of 
Jewish people, Chinese people, whatyouma 
-- Syrian people, you know? But e -- you can 
call it, I think, you know, if you say for -- for a little country like that, maybe it was, you 

know? 

Q: I get the feeling that in Cuba, you did not
 feel so mu ch prejudice, is that true? 
A: That is very true. That is very, very true. 

Q: Even though they are just -- for th
e most part, traditionally Catholic? 
A: They were just wonderful. There were 
truly -- They™re -- They™re not hostile -- They 
were not hostile people. They were very 
compassionate people. A-And --And if they 
heard, oh you came from -- from Europe, oh then
, you know, they have to extra care -- 
extra good care of you, you know? This is the type
 of people they were. They were also 
people like -- if they would have a piece of 
bread and you tell them you™re hungry, they™ll 
give you half of their bread. Without asking 
any questions, it doesn™t matter who you are. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
47
  
 
 
So, this is the type of people that they we
re. Of course, I don™t know what kind of people 
they are today. Must understand, it™s been ove
r 40 years. Now, leadership had changed, 
and people changed -- 
Q: Oh, but yi -- that™s not why you left? 

A: Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Not at all. The re
ason why -- I left before Castro came into 
power and that was simp ly because I felt that 
there wasn™t for me, enough, in Cuba, as far 
as a social life, as far as marriage. You know, like -- are -- and I felt that -- and my  aunts 

really wanted me to come here. That was 
a good reason. So they quickly made up papers 
for me and I came to the United States. 

Q: Your mother stayed in Cuba? 

A: Yeah, my mother stayed in
 Cuba. My sister was married 
and she stayed in Cuba. My 
brother came to the United States before I did. 

Q: Oh, so he was already here? 

A: Yeah, he was already here. And then I came, you know, for -- on a temporary we -- 

visa, to see, you know, do I like it, don™t I lik
e it? You know, what™s doing. And while I 
was here, Castro came into power, because I came here in 1957, okay? And Castro came 

into power 1959 or ‚60, something like that
. 19 six -- maybe ‚59. Oh well, something 
like. So, I -- I came here and I lived with my aunts. 

Q: So you never went back? 

A: Oh, yes I did. I went back
 to visit my mother, yeah. 
Q: Okay. Many times? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
48
  
 
 
A: N-Not many times, because then my moth
er decided to come here, too, so -- 
Q: Because of the political scene? 
A: Because she felt my brother™s here and I™m here, then -- and her sisters are here, so 

what is she going to do there, you know? And the 
other sister were here already, too. You 
see, like, my  aunt also moved here. So my
 aunt and -- my  mo ther decided she may as 
well stay -- come to the Unite
d States. Why stay in Cuba? 
Q: Do you rememb er any particular feelings
 of sadness about leaving from one place to 
another, or -- 

A: I -- I -- You know, I -- I really didn™t feel
 sad, because I knew Cuba™s only 45 minutes 
from -- from Miami, so it™s not like you going aw
ay -- far, far away. And then, the fact 
that I™m -- I™m having family here and my 
brother™s here an-and my mother was willing 
to come, so I didn™t feel that I was lonely, you 
know, that I™ll be alone in the world, so no, 
I -- I always felt I can go back to Cuba. Uh-huh, you have a ha -- an hour. Uh-huh. 

Q:  All right, so, in your arrival to Americ
a, where did your family live and where did 
you first settle? 

A: Okay, the first stop was east New 
York. My aunt lived on Miller Avenue. 
Q: On what? 

A: Miller Avenue, in east New York. And, very  lovely area and this is my youngest aunt, 

who had -- I mean, one son passed away, unfort
unately, but at that time she had two boys 
and her husband and they lived in an apartmen t, but she had a room for me. And we got 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
49
  
 
 
along very well and I really was very happy,
 you know, be wi -- in her house. And during 
that time, my brother got married, my
 mo ther came to the wedding. And -- 
Q: Your brother married an American? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Okay. 

A: Yeah, got married here. And then, oh yeah
, then I decided I wanted to stay here 
permanently, so -- but I was here on a temporar
y visa and the only way for me to remain, 
I either had to go to school or marry an Am
erican. So, I decided I would like to go to 
school. But then, you know, not every school is 
going to admit you and I wanted to go to 
a Yeshiva University. That™s a 
teacher™s institute for women,
 a Yeshiva University. So, I 
-- So -- I -- Then, at that time, I moved to 
another aunt of mine, who is not here any 
longer, Margaret and I went -- Manya, we used to call her, and she -- 

Q: Manya? 

A: Manya, yeah. Russian name. 

Q: That™s pa -- a Russian -- 

A: Russian name. 

Q: And you™re speaking English now. 

A: I know. So I call her Margaret. 

Q: So where did you learn English? 

A: Oh, English. Oh, wa -- English, I learned in Cuba. 

Q: Okay. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
50
  
 
 
A: Yes, right. I learned in Cuba, in my  
-- you know, my  -- my  courses, I took English. 
Just like I took shorthand and I took typing, you know, commercial course and 
everything else. And I took bookkeeping. You na
me it, I took a lot of things. And let™s 
see, where was I now? And -- 

Q: Yeshiva. 

A: Okay, right. Okay, so -- so my  Aunt Manya took me to meet her rabbi, who is now a -

- a -- the chairman of the -- oh, what do you ca
ll this? Big organization, I just forgot the 
name of it, but okay, his name is Rabbi Art
hur Schnier. And he really deals now, at the 
present time with -- with relationships betw
een Judaism and Chris
tian -- Christians, you 
know, yeah, he™s -- I forgot what he called 
it. I™ll tell you in a minute.[indecipherable] 
Yeah, okay, so I went and I met Rabbi Arthur
 Schnier and h-he wa
s always involved in 
politics and he knew a lot of  people in Wa
shington and he knew a lot of people here. 
And anyway, my  aunt told him the story, th
at I would like to remain in, you know, this 
country and I would like to go to school. And 
so my choice is Teacher™s Institute for 
Women, I would like to be a Hebrew teacher. 
And so he said, ﬁOkay, I™ll see what I can 
do,ﬂ and he arranged for the Yeshiva to acce
pt me, but before, I had to go through exam. 
Now, I never had any background in the Yeshiv
a or anything like that, but they gave me 
two weeks to prepare myself fo
r the exam and I did very well, I was accepted. And after I 
was accepted, I -- I was going to -- to school 
three times a week and -- and I worked 20 
hours a week. I was allowed to work 20 hours a week, so I always had, you know, a few 

dollars of my own. And I -- I-I met, in my 
class, my classmate. We became very good 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
51
  
 
 
friends, with this young lady, her name was 
Sivia and she lived in Crown Heights, 
Brooklyn and she would occasionally invite
 me to her house for, you know, for the 
weekend. And then one day she said to me
, ﬁYou know, I know s -- a very nice fellow I 
would like you to meet.ﬂ And I said, ﬁOh Sivia,
 I have so many blind dates. I really don™t 
want to meet any mo re.ﬂ And she said to me
, ﬁBut he™s very nice, and I do want you to 
meet him. So, let me give him your tele
phone number and I™ll never bother you again.ﬂ 
Well, she gave Harry, my  husband my  telephone number, and he called me. So, we made 

a date, the day my  brother was getting marri
ed. So he should come to the wedding and 

pick me up. And that™s what he did. And so
, we met. And we went out and I guess there 
was something that we developed in comm
on. And then, after, you know, dating him for 
about five months -- from January, February, Ma rch, April, May, June, five months and 

he never said anything. So, I said to my sel
f, ﬁOkay, I™ll make him talk.ﬂ I can™t go on, 
you know, I just come out and ask him, ﬁWe
ll, are we serious? I-Is -- I mean, are you 

interested in me or what?ﬂ So, 
I said to my self, ﬁOkay, that gives me a chance to go back 
to visit my mother.ﬂ Okay? And that wa -- 
no, the ma -- ma -- I™m sorry, my mother was 
here, the rest of the family, right. I said, 
ﬁOkay, I™m going to go to Cuba.ﬂ And that™s 
what I did. So, we were dating for f-five mont
hs, he said nothing, so I told him, ﬁI™m 
going back to Cuba and -- and I™ll decide if I™m -- you know, I™ll think about if I™m 

coming back or not coming back, I™m --ﬂ this
, that. So, I went back to Cuba and he 
started writing letters. Every day I would ge
t a letter from him and telephone calls and 
this and that and this and that. And then, in
 the meantime, I -- I was teaching in the -- in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
52
  
 
 
the Hebrew school in Cuba, Judaism. And 
Labor day, my  husband surprised me and 
came to visit me, to Cuba, and -- you know, in t hose days we had no jets. I-It -- He had to 
fly four and a half hours -- five hours to get 
to Cuba from the u -- from New York. But he 
came and he met the rest of the family. 

Q: This is in the early 60™s? 

A: Yup, this was -- This was in, yeah, 
1960. No, no, I™m sorry, 1959, no, 1959, because 
we got married in 1960. 1959, and then he ca
me again Christmas -- Christmas weekend, 
you know, the same year, and he proposed. And 
so, we got married --civilly married in 
Cuba that is. And within three weeks, I was 
able to come into the United States as a 
resident, cause I married an American. 

Q: You didn™t go back because you had to, did you? 

A: No, I didn™t go back. I remained -- 

Q: Okay. To Cuba? 

A: Oh, no, no, no, I just went for a visit. 
And then -- but he, you know, a-a-after I married 
him, whatyoumacallit, legally, I become, automati
cally a resident of the United States, so 
I came in as a resident, within three weeks a
nd then we got religiously married in April. 
April 10th of 1960. 

Q: I want to ask you something about your
 relationship with your husband, when you 
were courting. Did you speak to him about th
e -- your  experiences, or did you speak to 
anyone about your experience
s during the Nazi regime? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
53
  
 
 
A: You know, it seems like all the survivors ha
ve the same problem. After the war, when 
-- you know, when we came to Cuba, and my  mo ther
 wanted to tell her sisters, as to what 
she went through during the war, you know, the 
Holocaust experience. The first thing 
they said to her, ﬁDon™t talk about it. It is pa
st, it™s finished with. You are free. Forget it.ﬂ 
Now, you cannot forget it. You cannot just
 push it away. But -- Although they meant 
well, it wasn™t right. And so the minute they sa
id, ﬁDon™t talk about it, it™s finished with, 
now you™re free, you™re here, everything will be
 all right. That™s it.ﬂ So we never spoke 
about it. And when I was, you know, dating my
 husband or when I was with whomever I 
was, I f -- I didn™t want, A, to talk about it,
 because it™s very painful. Every time I would 
start talking, I would start crying. It™s only 
recently that I don™t cry as mu ch and I think I 
ran out of -- of -- of tears. But, that makes me sick. Like, for example, you take this 

interview. It™ll take me a week or 10 days for me to get back to be normal. That means, I 

won™t sleep nights. That means, it™s constan
tly even mo re so. Although I live with this 
experience every day, by talking about it, it 
-- it intensifies and intensifies my  whole 
system, my  mind, my  body, everything like, 
gets sick. So, we didn™t talk about it. 
Q: When did you first begin to talk about it? 

A: I think maybe fif -- 10 years ago, 15 years ago, maybe. 

Q: Before the interview w
ith the Holocaust Museum? 

A: No, I think during that time, yeah. I w ould say I would start talking about it -- was 

truly telling the story? That was the first time 
I would sit and tell the story. In between, I 
would tell my children, here and there a little 
bit. Cause when they were small, I didn™t 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
54
  
 
 
want to upset them. I didn™t want them to be 
afraid of this world by thinking, ﬁOh, that™s 
what happened to my  mo ther. Might happen to
 me, too.ﬂ So, I didn™t want them to live 
with that worry on their minds, so I kept qui
et. But, occasionally, things would happen so 
very quickly, I would say something, you know? And that was that, you know, but they -
- I never really sat down to tell them the 
story until I was interviewed by the -- by the 
mu seu m. 

Q: Did you have -- I™ll -- We™ll go back to ma
rriage. We™ll -- We™ll never forget about 
marriage. So that™ll be easy, well, that
™ll be the next tape, but do you have -- you 
mentioned -- made reference to dreams or night mares or -- about what sorts of things do 

you dream? 

A: Well, you know, for many, many years after the war, I was always dreams. I used to 

dream a lot about my  father and just wake up screaming like -- I saw him as how he 

disappeared, you know? I -- I -- I used to dream
 about the bombing. I -- I used to -- to 
dream about suddenly finding my self alone
, you know, nobody™s there but me, I™m alone. 
I-I-I mean, you know, a lot of these things. But th
en, it wasn™t already dreams, it™s reality, 
every day, see? Every day, there is somethi
ng that reminds me of my past. So, although I 
don™t have as many dreams as I used to ha
ve, I am constantly reminded by different 
things that I come across. 

Q: Tell me what kind of things. 

A: Well, the story with my cat who was 
killed while walking behind me. And so I 
always, when I see a -- a Persian cat, i-it bothers me, you know, i-it really -- tears come to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
55
  
 
 
my eyes, because I always keep thinking, wa
s that bullet meant for me, or was it truly 
meant for my cat? And then, why should a cat be killed? He did nothing. I -- So, I -- I 
would just walk and -- and -- and -- and I™ll say 
to my self, ﬁOh, he looks just like my  cat, 
my kitty.ﬂ A-A-And then, I™ll hear a -- a Ge rman Shepherd bark and that™ll -- it™s like 

suddenly I find my self -- I have to hide. He
y, but why am I hiding? I am in a free 

country. But that™s the feeling I get. I-I-I see a 
fellow walking with that -- with that hat, 
that cap, a little raise up front like the German 
soldiers -- not the ger -- the SS would wear 
and I -- and I™ll say, ﬁOoh, is he one of them
?ﬂ I mean, i-it™s really crazy, but that™s -- 
that™s what this war did to you. A -- A -- A barn, I -- I™ll walk by, I mean, you know, on 

the island, the houses and they have like 
little barns in the back and there goes the 
memory to when we were hiding and then we
 had to jump from -- fro
 -- from the attic of 
that barn and -- and run away because th
e Germans will -- while the Germans were  
breaking the door to get in to get us. And 
w-we jump ed down and we ran away. A-And 
it™s, hey -- 

Q: Do you ever think of that little 
dog that kept you warm under the house? 
A: Oh, yeah. That little dog. The reason why I -- 
I think of him a lot is the fact that he 
was so good. Can you imagine a dog would not 
bark when he sees me climbing in, you 
know? And I would lie down and he would lie 
on my  legs to keep me warm, because I 
had no blanket. I told you, rememb er I wa
s walking with knee-highs? I had nothing to 

cover my self with. An-And the lady didn™t know that I slept under her house with her 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
56
  
 
 
dog. And this dog just was so smart. I woul
d just climb in and lie down and he would 
right away lie down on my  legs and keep me warm. 
Q: Have you had pets since? 

A: No, no. 

Q: Do you think this -- there™s a reason for that? 

A: Yeah, there is a reason, yeah. See, I only 
had one doll in my life and that was the doll 
that my  bro -- my  father bought for me before the war. I had a beautiful doll, a big one. 

My father took me to this store that sold onl
y dolls. And he said to me, ﬁYou pick.ﬂ And I 
was so little, but I picked this
 doll from the shelf and the do
ll was bigger than I was. I 
couldn™t even carry the doll home, my  sister 
had to carry it for me and the doll would sit 
on the rocking chair in the living room. And this
 is the doll I took with me when we went 
to the ghetto, when we had to leave home.
 And of course, you know, after -- after the 
pogrom, I never saw my  doll again. After that, 
I never had a doll again, that was finished. 
Because I think that with th
e war, my childhood went, okay? I-I think that the Holocaust 
killed my childhood, but did not kill my spirit 
and did not kill, you know, the rest of my 
life. I -- I™m still alive an-and going strong. A-
And then after what happened to my cat, I 
never wanted one. I always think about my  ca
t, but I never wanted one. And when I had 
my little boy, my youngest son, a neighbor of
 mine had a -- a Siamese cat and the 
Siamese cat gave birth to little Siamese kitte
ns and she said, ﬁFrima, you should have one 
for your child. And I™m giving it to you for nothing and you know how expensive they 

are and you know how good they are, [indeciphera
ble].ﬂ ﬁOkay,ﬂ I said, ﬁFine.ﬂ So I got 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
57
  
 
 
one for my -- for my son. But, every so ofte
n, when I used to sit down and the cat would 
jump  into my  lap and I would, you know, ca
ress him and I -- I would think about my  -- 
my  Persian cat a-and then I gave it away 
and I -- and I really, you know, I don™t want any 
-- any mo re, cause it™s -- it was a horrible experience, and -- and I used, you know, to 

dream about my  cat and always used to scream and i-it was really bad, it was very a -- for 

a -- to a child it was terrible, you know, terrible 
shock, a-a-and -- and -- and the fact that -
- that I let him die without even turning 
around looking at him or picking him up or -- 
Q: So having -- Part of what has happened 
through your whole experi
ence, is hiding your 
feelings? 

A: Sure. It was always -- no one should know
 you are Jewish. It™s like you have some 
kind of a disease. I mean, to go as far as to 
know, at the age of six, that if I should turn 
around an-an-and -- and talk to my  cat or pick
 up my  cat or caress my  cat or whatever, 
that the Germans will know I™m Jewish. I -- I me
an, that takes an awful lot of -- out of 
you of -- of saying, what am I, am I not human? I mean, who am I? What am I? Am I -- 

Am I a -- some kind of a disease to the world? 
End of Tape Two, Side B

Beginning Tape Three, Side A 
Q: This is a United States Holocaust Memo
rial Museum interview with Frima Laub, 
conducted by Ginger Miles, on Nove
mb er 23rd, 1998. This is tape number three, side A. 
Now we did get briefly into marriage. 
A: Uh-huh. 

Q: You were married in 1960, and then -- in  a civil ceremony, and when you came back 

to America -- 

A: No, ninet -- no, civil ceremony, 1959, okay? 
Then, three weeks later, we came to the 
United States and we set a date for April the 
10th, 1960, to be married. And, at that time, 
my  mo ther was here already. My sister was in Cuba and she did not make it to the 

wedding, but my  brother was here, my  a
unts and my  uncles and everybody was at the 
wedding and it was just very lovely. Was just
 the immediate family. Course, we couldn™t 
afford a wedding -- my mother, that is, couldn™t afford a wedding. 

Q: Do you rememb er the rabbi? 

A: No. 

Q: No.  

A: No.  

Q: But he was -- 

A: 39 years ago and -- and I didn™t even get married in my  neighborhood, I got married in 

my  husband™s neighborhood, which was Lower East
 Side, okay? Clinton Plaza, which is 
-- does not exist any longer. But, it wa -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
59
  
 
 
Q: And you moved with him somewhere. 
A: Oh well, we moved to Brooklyn, yeah. 

Q: Brooklyn. 

A: We moved to Brooklyn. 

Q: Where you lived for a long time? 

A: Oh yes, we lived in Brooklyn for about 30 some odd years. 

Q: What section? 

A: Flatbush, yeah. 

Q: And your children, you have? 

A: My children -- I have three children. I 
have -- My daughter™s the oldest, Linda and 
then I have Myron, he is the middle child 
and then I have Avi, who™s the little one. And 
they were all born in Brooklyn -- oh no, w
ith the exception -- my  boys were born in 
Brooklyn. My daughter was born in Beth Israel
, in New York. And then we moved to -- 
to Windmere. 

Q: I want to ask you, before we -- because th
is getting  married brings up the subject of -- 
of where you get married, which brings up the 
subject of identity as a religious Jew. 
A: Mm-hm. 

Q: Has this been a part -- an important part of your experience, or -- 

A: An important part of survival. 

Q: In what way? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
60
  
 
 
A: Well, you see, by believing that God will 
help you and that there™s someone watching 
over you, that was a -- a tremendous help for a 
child to survive. Because, although I was -
- you know, I had no mother with me, I had no one, I was alone, I knew God will help 
me. And I did my  praying every night, as you 
know that my  mo ther left me the hundred 

rubles, and after the second lady, the one w
ho shaved my  head because I was infested 
with lice, because here and there, I didn™t ha
ve a shower or a bath or anything like that 

and I slept with mice crawling over me. I -- I bought a cross for the hundred rubles. Now, 

I knew that the reason why I need the cross 
is in case I™m stopped by someone and they 
will accuse me of being a Jew, I can prove I™m
 not, cause I wanted to live. But, I also 

knew that Christianity is not me. I™m a Jew a
nd I have my  own prayers and I have to say 
those prayers and I have to talk to God and 
he will help me. And that™s exactly what I 
did. Every night, when I climbed in, you know
, in -- one, two o™clock in the mo rning 
when I climbed in to my  -- my  -- my  doggy, to
 sleep with, I would take off my  cross and 
in Hebrew I would say my  prayers, those pray
ers that my  mo ther taught me when I was a 
little girl. 

Q: Do you rememb er one of the prayers now? 

A: Well, the prayers, it is called, Creat schma.
 It™s a prayer before you go to sleep, okay? 
So, I would say Creat schma. And then in 
the mo rning, when I would get up and -- and 
shake off the hay, because we
 slept -- the dog and I slept on the hay, okay? And I shake 
off the hay and -- and got my self, you know, straightened out, I should -- shouldn™t look 

like I c-come hiding from someplace, put my  
scarf on. I would say, Moday ani. Moday 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
61
  
 
 
ani is a Jew -- is a Hebrew prayer where I 
thank you God for -- that I™m -- that I got up, 
that I survived another day, that I™m here. 
And then after that, I would put the cross on 
again. Now, I knew the reason why I was wear
ing a cross, not because I was giving away 
my belief, but because, if I™m a Christian, I can 
survive. I will not be killed. Where, if I™m 
a Jew, I haven™t got a chance.  
Q: And today, are you active in 
a spiritual, religious community? 
A: Yeah. I am a religious Jew. I remained 
religious all through the Holocaust, after the 
Holocaust, the way I am now. And I -- I truly fe
el, and that is my -- my very deep belief 
that there was and there is someone above me 
who guided me to do all these things that I 
did to survive. I was only five years old and 
I acted as if I was someone of 50. And I was 
six year old, I did things like a six year old 
person. So, there™s got to be s -- a power over 
me, making me do things. Giving me that -- that
 -- that intelligence. I mean, I -- I -- I look 
at my  grandchild, five years old and I say, 
ﬁOh my  God, Oh my  God. Please God,ﬂ and I 
always pray to God, ﬁMay -- May no child know
 of -- of -- of such horrors.ﬂ But they 
could never survive, because they never 
think the way I thought. Now, did I think 
because I was a genius? No, it™s because there™
s something that I can not explain. But I 
feel it. So, with the sad life and the hard lifeand the disappointments in life, I always feel 

that I™m rewarded by God. I really do. And 
I always thank God for everything. After the 
meals, I thank God. When I light my  candles
, I thank God. Whatever there is, I always 
pray, but when I pray, I really pray with my
 heart. And I -- And I -- And I remember wh-
wh-when I was that little girl, that five, six ye
ar old girl and -- and I was all alone, I never 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
62
  
 
 
felt alone. I always felt that there™s so
meone watching over me. A-A-And this is 
something that™s -- I think it™s extremely impor
tant to a child. Not to feel alone. Yeah, I 
was frightened, but I always knew that th
ere™s a salvation, you know? Because I was 
praying, because I was talking and -- and, you 
know, to God. And -- And this is -- That™s 
a wonderful way of surviving.  
Q: It™s -- It™s is -- It is to some and -- and 
then to others, their response has been totally 
different. 

A: Unfortunately, yes. And you can not blame 
those people, no. Cause they went -- the 
horrors were -- are absolutely -- you can™ t understand the horrors. I-I-I-It -- Your mind 

just can not absorb or understand that such 
a thing exists, and -- and -- and someth -- and 
one human does it to another and -- and the vi
ctim did nothing. Simp ly because he is a 
Jew? So what does it mean? It -- Because a Jew? What is it, no good? What are we -- are 

we -- am I diseased? A-Am I -- Di-Did I 
kill someone? Why such hatred? Why such 
hostility? Crime. I mean, so much. Y-You probabl
y heard it, that when we were standing 
ar -- I mean, I don™t know if you want to hear
 it, when we were standing on line to be 
killed, the first pogrom, a-and we were in lik
e maybe two or three people ahead of us, we 
were all in line, you know, with our underwear only, waiting to be killed. We had those 

killing squads. There was a mother holding a 
little baby, right? And this German walks 
over to her, a-and wants to take the baby aw
ay from her. She wouldn™t let him. And there 
was a whole struggle going on and I™m standing 
there in shock. I didn™t know wha -- a -- 
a -- a -- I didn™t believe my own eyes, I-I mean 
-- so, you™re talking about a five year old 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030

kid standing there and watching that -- this Ge
rman is trying to take the baby away from 
the mother and the mother wouldn™t let. So 
he pulls the baby towards him and she pulls 
the baby towards her, right? There™s how. Fina
lly, he got the baby out of her arms, pi-
picks up his -- his -- his leg, yeah, with t
hose boots up there and breaks the baby™s back 
and gives it back to the ba -- to the mothe
r. Are these atrocities? Who can forget this? 
Q: Does this make you bitter and angry over 
other things in your life, I mean. Are you 
angry at -- 

A: I™m angry at the world, yeah, yeah, yeah. 

Q: The religious Christians? 

A: I-I -- I don™t know if I™m exactly picking out
 religious, non-religious. I™m just angry at 
the world, simply because the world didn™t ev
en try to save some children. There™s a 
million and a half children slaughtered for 
nothing and nobody tried to help them. That™s 
what I™m angry about. Has nothing to do with 
religion or not religion. Just as a human 
being, how could you not try to do somethi
ng? Maybe -- M-Maybe they -- they couldn™t 
saved everyone, but some? And do you rememb er 
that there was that ship, Saint Louis, 
that had 900 -- 850 or 900 German Jews fro
m the high society, you are talking the 
wealthy people, they™re educated people,doctors and dentists 
and engineers and you 
name it. And the United States didn™t want 
to let them in. A handful of people, 900 

people they didn™t want to let them in and 
then, when they went to Cuba, Cuba said, 
ﬁHey, the United States is not letting them
 in, why should I bother?ﬂ They are a little, 
small country. They didn™t let them in, either. And -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
64
  
 
 
Q: Where were you [indecipherable] 
A: I was in Europe? 

Q: You were in Europe when this happened? 

A: Yeah, yeah. This was -- This mu st have
 been in 1940 when the ship came around. And 
nobody wanted that ship with the 900 Jews. So, you see why I™m angry? 

Q: Oh -- 

A: It™s the world. It™s not just particul
ar people. And nobody -- And they went back to 
Germany. 

Q: Do you rememb er who was president when you first came here? 

A: Well, during the war, Frankwi -- Franklin
 Roosevelt was president during World War 
Two. 

Q: Do you rememb er impressions about him? Family impressions? 

A: Well, let me tell you the following. I™m -- After the war -- after the war, I -- rememb er 

I told you my  house was always open, people us
ed to come and go and have a cup of tea 
and have soup. I was then eight years old, ni
ne years old. I -- I would hear how the older 
-- you know, the older survivors would talk. And 
then I first realized what they were 
talking about. They were saying that what ha
ppened to the president of the United States. 
That the United States did nothing. That 
Roosevelt obviously didn™t care mu ch about 

Jews. So, that™s the only thing that I began to
 understand. That there was such a thing as a 
president and the president just didn™t care about the Jews. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
65
  
 
 
Q: So, you did -- you were aware that survivor
s then, only talked to each other about the 
experience. You did hear other surviv -- olde
r survivors talking, and that was the only 
time it was every discussed? 

A: That™s it. That™s is. They were talking,
 saying that nobody was there to  help the Jews. 

There was nobody except God, and that was that. 

Q: There™s a list of different things that happe
ned in -- in the world history, but especially 
in the -- in the American histor
y, that I™d like to read to you 
to see if any of these things 
you connected with your experience and with 
that experience and -- and if you didn™t, 
we™ll just move on, you know, but I -- I think the -- 

A: Are you talking about now or when I was 10 
years old? What are we talking -- I mean, 
talking about how I felt -- 

Q: Well, I™ll -- 

A: Yeah, go ahead, read it. 

Q: This is one example, the Japanese con
centration camps that happened in America. 
You might have been not here, or [indecipherable] 

A: I heard of them, but there is no comp
arisons. No comparisons whatsoever. The 
concentration camps that the Germans built,
 nobody builds concentration camps like they 
do. And the atrocities that they committed, no 
one that I know of today, does what they 
did then. Now, concentration camp  might
 have different meanings, see? The 
concentration camps of the Chinese people 
here, that the one you™re talking about? 
Q: Yeah, Japanese camps. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
66
  
 
 
A: Japanese, oh, okay, was a camp  where the 
people, because of the war with Japan, the 
government wanted to make sure that these people do not commit terrorism and 
therefore, it was a camp for people to concentrate. But there were no killings, there were 

no atrocities. There were no starvation. Th
ere were no beatings. There were no ripping 
apart human -- person apart. Or pulling his a -- 
eyes out or pulling his teeth out or ripping 
him to pieces w-while he™s alive and burning 
him to death. So, how can we compare a 
United States camp, which is a camp just to
 make sure that these people do not commit 
terrorism, compared to a concentration camp -- a German concentration camp where 

there -- the idea was to annihilate people. To ge
t rid of them as quickly as possible and to 
do a lot of -- what do we call it, experiments. 
Do you know that they -- 
they used the skin 
to make lamp shades? And -- And some other things? 

Q: So, I want to ask you, Frima, cause I™m trying to focus on -- on -- on your -- your 

particular experience and that is -- so, in your
 life, are there things, like in your job that 
you do right now, or that in the work that you™
ve had or in your attitudes toward people, 
or homeless or -- that relate, that are inspired
 by that experience? I hate to use the word 
inspired, but -- but are -- are you motivat ed still today in constructive ways? 

A: Very much so. 

Q: Could you tell me a little bit about what you™re doing today that -- or -- 

A: You see, somehow my -- my sad life and my
 experience, all this still left me with a 
very good heart. And -- And it just doesn™t matter to me if I™m dealing with a person from 

any nationality. I-It just doesn™t matter. It™s just
 the fact that I want to help and it™s the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
67
  
 
 
right thing to do. It™s to help another human 
being, cause we all belong to God and we all 
his children and we should help each other. A
nd so, as hard as my  life was -- but there 
were some of those good Gentile people that helped me. So, I-I never thought otherwise, 
this how I™m supposed to be and this is
 how every person should be. And -- And you 
probably heard or maybe I didn™t mention to
 you, that when we came back, you know, 
after the war, after liberation, we came back home an-and rememb er I told you there was 

a Gentile man that, when I was alone and I wa
s starved and I needed food, I -- I went to 
him and I told him I was hungry, so he offered 
me a glass of milk, a piece of black bread 
and a piece of pork. And I, as a Jew, in w
hose house we had no pork, I had the milk, I 
had the bread, but I wouldn™t touch the pork. 
And I never told him why, cause I™m not 
supposed to tell him. I just eat what he gave
 me and I thanked him and I loved him for it. 
Also, the first pogrom, when we ran away, we met in his house, you know, we are 

supposed to an-and we did, we met in his hous
e an-and he let us stay overnight in his 
cellar and I rememb er the rats were running a
ll over us, but we stayed at night there. 
Now, when we came back -- after liberation we
 came back home, we were notified by his 
wife that the Russian government wants to put
 him in jail because he was -- he was an 
informant and -- yeah, he was an informan
t and we don™t really know what happened, 
what he did, because we were in Roma
nia, right? So, we don™t know what happened 
here. But I remember that he was good to us
 and his wife said, ﬁIf you child will go to 

court and tell them how he tr
eated you and your family, they will let him go, he won™t 
have to go to jail.ﬂ Well, I did. My mo ther took me to court and I rememb er it was a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
68
  
 
 
round room. And in the middle there was a ch
air and I climbed on the chair and I stood 
and told them that this man saved my  life, 
because I was starved and he gave me food to 
eat. And the night that we had no place where 
to go, we came to him and he let us -- and 
they let him free. So, you see, when somebody does good for you, you learn something 
from it and you try to do the same. 

Q: And you still have koshe
r household -- kitchen? 
A: Yeah, yup. It™s still a kosher home and my 
children follow me in the same footsteps. 
Q: So your children also married Jewish? 

A: Yes, they all married to Jewish boys, Jewi
sh girls and -- and that™s how they bring up 
their children and that -- that™s a blessing for me. 

Q: Can you see them? 

A: Yes. 

Q: You see them often? 

A: Absolutely, we see them and we talk 
 to each other. And it™s wonderful to have 
grandchildren and I feel especially blesse
d, you know, that when Hitler thought he™ll get 
rid of me, look, I brought up two generations. 
And I was a step ahead of my  enemy, all 
the time, see? And that is something that I 
feel that I-I couldn™t have done it on my own. 
And I had no -- no one to tell me what to do,
 right? Except God was telling me what to 
do and that™s what I did, and here I am. 

Q: And -- And I -- I get the feeli
ng you also have non-Jewish friends. 
A: Oh yeah, oh sure I do. What --  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
69
  
 
 
Q: And your work now? 
A: -- why not? 

Q: Well yeah, why not? 

A: They all wonderful. You see, I look at people,
 not at their beliefs or their color or their 
race. I look at people. There are good people a
nd there are bad people and I love to work 
with a lot of different people. And I love -- I have neighbors, all kinds of neighbors. I 

have a Yugoslavian neighbor, an Italian ne
ighbor, a Jewish neighbor, another Italian 
neighbor and I love them. And we get along so
 well. And why not? That™s how is has to 
be. Maybe if -- if we would only try to be
 good to each other, the world will be a better 
world to live in and then we wouldn™t let th
ese things happen, these atrocities and some 
of them are happening today in the other count
ries, yugos -- what was it? In -- In -- In -- 
Q: [indecipherable] 

A: Europe there someplace. It™s horrible. 

Q: So, where do you work today? 

A: I work in a mental health clinic. Mostly we deal with 
children and some adults. People 
who are depressed, people who have problems 
with their children, hyperactive children. 
But I like my  job. I like it very mu ch, cause 
I love to look at the children and I always 
say, ﬁI hope they never go through horrors like we
 did in Europe.ﬂ I always pray for these 
children. And I love it. I like to work. I 
like to be with young people. The thought of 
retiring scares me. Well -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
70
  
 
 
Q: Well, when -- when you -- when we part t
oday, after this interview, are you going to 
have someone to talk to about any extra e
xperiences that you thought in your mind, that 
came to you? Would you talk to your husband or any of your children or any of your 
friend survivors? 

A: To talk to them about today? Well  the rest of the month -- 

Q: Well, about whatever comes up afterwar
ds. You said often, you said maybe for a 
week or 10 days -- 

A: Oh. 

Q: -- you would be thinking about things. 

A: Oh yeah, I™ll be -- I don™t know. Maybe. 
You know, the children ha -- are busy with 
their own lives. Friends are busy with their 
own lives. The husband comes home, he -- he 

-- he -- he has so many responsibilities at work. The only way that I will handle my 

frustration and my  sadness and then, you know, a
nd everything else that this would leave 
me with, is I will just start writing and ma
ybe someday, I would like to publish a book. 
And -- And -- And that™s what I™m going to do. I -- I do want to leave a book out there 

for the children. For elementary
 school children, for high school children, so they can see 
that there is strength and when you have 
belief, that helps and you can do -- you -- you ca 

-- you can do a lot of things when you have to. 
You also have to believe in your parents 
and you have to believe in God. I -- I -- 
And -- And you can do, you know, things which, 
later on you will ask, ﬁHow did I do it?ﬂ But -- But you™ll do it and you will survive. 

Q: Well, you certainly are a great inspiration, yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
71
  
 
 
A: Thank you, thank you, thank you. 
Q: I think there™s -- there™s -- 

A: Oh, yeah. 

Q: -- there™s so much more. 

A: A lot, a lot. A lot more. So --  
End of Tape Three, Side A 
Beginning Tape Three, Side B 
Q: This is the final side, B, of tape thr
ee, Frima Laub and we™re about to comp lete the 
interview, due to time constrictions, but 
I did want to ask about your mo ther. You 
mentioned on the 1990 interview, that your mo
ther suffered from the day she died. And I 
wondered if you -- this triggers back to the 
-- her experience in the Holocaust, or did you 
mean physical suffering, or -- 

A: Well, my mother really never got over th
e Holocaust. Sh-She just never was able to 
recuperate. A, a-as you know, as a mo ther, sh
e -- she lost her husband. She was a very 
young widow. Then she went through all this a
nd she was the one who had to make all 
the plans for our escape. She did all this, you know, the plans. You know, you -- you 

probably know that we were also in jail for 
awhile, okay. I mean, she made all these -- 
these plans of how to escape and where to r
un and what to say and where to -- where to 
go, because we were children. I was a little 
nothing and my dau -- my sister was 10 years 
older than I was, so she was s
till a child. So, my mother had to
 use all this. Then, the first 
pogrom, I-I -- I told you, when -- when the 
Germans were taking off the jewelry, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
72
  
 
 
whatever the -- the women or the men wo-wore,
 jewelry, rings, i-if you didn™t take it off 
by yourself quick enough and they wanted the ri
ng, they would rip it off with your finger. 
And -- And if -- And if you didn™t take off your
 earrings fast enough, they would rip off, 
you know, the ear or the loop -- or the loop where -- which -- which you were -- with -- 
with that earring. And my  mo ther wasn™t fast
 enough, so -- so one -- one SS hit her with a 
-- with a rifle -- with the end of the rifle, he 
hit her so hard over the he -- over the ear, that 
she fell down. And -- And she was always d
eaf on this ear. She couldn™t -- My mo ther 
never recuperated. And she always used to
 say, because -- I mean -- and I™m saying I 
think since -- when she arrived, when I arri
ved in Cuba, she wanted to tell her sisters 
what she went through and they said to he
r, ﬁDon™t talk about it.ﬂ She felt very -- like 
very explosive inside, where she wanted to ta
lk about it, but -- but the sisters said, ﬁDon™t 
talk about it.ﬂ  

Q: So she had no one to talk to? 

A: Never talked to. But, to me she woul d -- every -- well, I was the one who was the 

closest to her and I was with her all the tim
e and she would alway say, ﬁThe world should 
know, Frima. The world should know.ﬂ You know
, like this. And we would never talk, 
like -- there were a lot of questions I want
ed to ask my  mo ther, you know, as I grew 
older, but then I didn™t want to upset he
r, because I knew how mu ch she was suffering 
with -- with everything that -- everything th
at she went through and she -- in her own 
way, she went through a lot. 

Q: Is she passed on now? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
73
  
 
 
A: Oh, my  mo ther passed on in -- she died 
in 1980. No, I™m -- excuse me, that™s my  
mo ther-in-law died in 1980 and my  brotherdied in 1980. My mo ther died in 1993. 
Q: So she outlived her son? 

A: Yeah. He died -- 

Q: ‚93, she lived a long time. 

A: In 1993, she was 87. 

Q: Yeah, she lived a long time. 

A: And my  brother died very young. He was 56. Yeah. 

Q: But do you think she had no one to talk to about the Holocaust? 

A: Not really, no. Not really. Unfortunately, not
 really. And you see, in those days, they -
- they were not interviewing yet, you know, like -- so -- 

Q: It wasn™t popular to talk about it. 

A: R -- Thank you. Okay, so she really never got
 a chance to tell her side of the story. But 
she used to tell me, ﬁFrima, make sure th
e world knows. Make sure the world knows.ﬂ 
Like she also never went into details, but sh
e, ﬁMake sure.ﬂ Like, in Yiddish, the world 
should know, -- Voos meels anan ibigigania 
-- what we went through. Cause she didn™t 
speak too mu ch English, so in Yiddish she 
would say, ﬁWhat we went through, the world 
should know.ﬂ And that™s that. She would -- She certainly -- 

Q: So she died to this -- speaking Yiddish? 

A: Oh yeah, she died speaking Yiddish, sh
e died speaking Russian. Yeah, she spoke 
Russian and she spoke Yiddish. And she wa
s younger, she spoke Ukrainian, she spoke 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
74
  
 
 
Polish. My mo ther spoke a lot of languages. 
My father spoke many languages, too, that™s 
why he was an interpreter to the German
s. He spoke about six, seven languages. 
Q: [indecipherable] I want to thank you so mu ch. 
A: You™re very welcome. 

Q: And I -- I know I™ll see you again, so -- 

A: Please God. Anytime. 

Q: We™ll be waiting for this book. 

A: Yeah. I -- I hope you can han -- give me a hand on that. 

Q: I hope we could. 

A: If you do, I™ll -- I™ll be very grateful -- 

Q: Grateful to you. 

A: -- and I™ll be honored with your -- with your comp any.

Interview with Frima Laub 
June 3, 1999 
Beginning Tape Four, Side A 
Question: This is tape one, side A, of 
a second audio follow up interview with Frima 
Laub, conducted by Ginger Miles, on June thir
d, 1999, for the United States Holocaust 
Memorial Museum. The United States Ho locaust Memo rial Museum gratefully 

acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for ma
king this interview possible. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030

Answer: Yeah. Well, for on the last interview 
-- interview that we had a few months ago, 
it took me about almo st two weeks to recuperate. I -- you know, I got -- I™m very upset. It 

leaves me very upset, and I do dream about, you know, certain happenings in those -- in 

those days, in those years. And -- But now, I 
guess, a few months later, I™m ready to talk 
again. 

Q: This time may be easier, because we™re not
 going to have to go through all the -- the 
childhood experience -- 

A: Right. 

Q: -- but the -- your experience since that tim
e. One of the things that we™re very 
interested in is, when you dream, what do 
you dream about? What part of the experience 
keeps coming back?  

A: The different -- you know, different happenings
. It™s where -- I™ll dream that there™s a 
knock on the door. I-- I™ll dream that s -- you know, s -- the dogs are following me. You 

know, the German Shepherds. So, it™s really di
fferent things. I -- I -- I™ll dream that I™m -- 
you know, I™m -- I™m walking in the street and -- and -- and, you know, how frightened I 

-- I am. It™s just different -- different things th
at happen. Of course, with each dream, I get 
up, I™m very upset. Or many times I™ll just wa
ke up, you know, after I have the dream, or 
if I ha -- if I™m screaming or I™m cr
ying or something, I just wake up. 
Q: And this 10 days, does that -- since our 
-- our first interview, did you -- did you wake 
up every night with dreams, or -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
76
  
 
 
A: Well, not every night. I was upset every da
y. It™s like -- i-it™s in front of you all the 
time, because when I talk about it, I relive 
those days, that time, you know. So it™s like -- 
Well, actually, I live with it every day, even if 
I don™t talk about it. As I walk the streets, 
if I hear a German Shepherd bark, right away
 it goes back to what happened to me in the 
past. Something very funny, if I see a-an 
army  officer or someone who wears, you know, 
the hats that -- that the officer wear, and it™
s high up front, they remind me very mu ch of 
the Gestapo hats, and this upsets me. Then, si
nce we live not too far from the airport -- I 
told you that last time, many times, I don™t 
know what, but suddenly there™s that noise, 

and that noise reminds me, after the war, for about one year, maybe a little longer, the 

Germans used to come in like 30 - 40 planes, to bomb the city where I lived. And so, as 

they were coming, there was the tremendous noi
se. And at the airport here, I can hear it 
too, and I don™t know, I don™t understand why 
this -- you know, why this noise comes 
from the airport. And I get very upset, beca
use I open the door and I will look up to the 
sky, like thinking that a plane™s coming in 
to bomb the city, God forbid. Oh my God, 
that™s terrible. 

Q: Now, what town were you in, the first year after liberation? 

A: Well, after liberation, we were, at that
 time in occupied Romania, okay? Okay? We 
were in occupied Romania, but then, after th
e liberation, we went back to the Ukraine 
and this is where we stayed. This is where my  home was, once upon a time. 

Q: I rememb er in our first tape, you disc
ussed how your mo ther never got over the 
Holocaust. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
77
  
 
 
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: And there seemed to be a sense of incompleteness -- 

A: Mm-hm. 

Q: -- in you, not -- not being able to talk 
with your mo ther about her experiences during 
the Holocaust. Could you talk a little bit about 
your relationship with your mother and if 
you ever were able to discu
ss the Holocaust with her? 
A: No. We were never able to talk about th
e Holocaust. She would talk about it, and you 
know, not mu ch. It -- I think what happened is , rememb er I mentioned to you that when 

we came to Cuba, after -- after the war, after 
we left Germany, and we went to Cuba 
because my mother had one of her sisters liv
ing there. Actually, we were supposed to 
come into the United States, but because th
ere was a delay and my mother somewheres 
heard that there™s going to be a World War 
Three, and she became panicky, she wanted 

to get out of Europe. So she wrote to her sist er and her sister quickly made out the papers, 

and we came to Cuba. When we came to C uba, my  aunts from the United States, also 

came to Cuba, to greet is when we arrive
d, which was wonderful, and was a beautiful, 
sunny day. It really was gorgeous. And my  
mo ther wanted to tell them about our 
experience, about her experience and -- and ever
ything that we went through, and all they 

said is, ﬁDon™t talk about it. It™s finished with, it™s -- it™s gone, it™s passe. Now you™re in a 

free country, you™re with your family, you ha ve nothing to fear, and we don™t tal -- you 

don™t tal -- you don™t --  you shouldn™t be talking 
about it because there™s nothing to talk 
about, finished.ﬂ So, I guess, after that, 
she was sort of, you know, she wouldn™t talk 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
78
  
 
 
about it much. But occasionally, I would he
ar her say, remember, you know, ﬁRemember 
Frima, rememb er?ﬂ I do. I do rememb er very mu ch. So we never really sat and spoke 
about it. It™s like she rememb ered her life and I rememb ered my  life. And -- A-And -- 

And also, I rememb er distinctly that -- i-in
 those days -- I mean, you™re talking about 
what, 40 years ago, or 50 years ago? It was 
something that if we did -- if she said, 
ﬁRemember this?ﬂ And I said, ﬁYes,ﬂ I would start crying right away. So, it was 

something that you just couldn™t talk about it.
 Besides, it was always in my  mind you™re 

not supposed to talk about it, because it™s alre ady past. So, we didn™t really discuss it, we 

didn™t really talk about it.  

Q: Why do you think your relatives didn™t want 
to hear -- was there a deeper reason, or 
did they have fear? 

A: No, I-I-I-I think -- I mean, my aunts were 
loving, loving aunts,
 and I had a loving 
family. I think they just didn™t want my  mo th
er to get upset every time she talks about it. 
Cause there was a lot to be upset about. I mean
, we lost a big family, including my  father, 
a grandmother, a -- aunts, uncles, cousins. We lo
st a lot of people, so I -- I think that this 
mu st have been the reason why they said, ﬁL
et™s not talk about it. You™re in the free 
country now, you understand? It™s finished, it™s 
gone and you™re safe with us. That™s it.ﬂ 
And I™m no -- a -- a -- I really don™t know if it would have been better talking about it, or 

was it better not to talk about it? I don™t know
. All I know is, whenever I used to think 
about it, I would cry. So --

Q: Well, being an objective observer of the 
situation, and not know
ing your aunts, with 
all respect to your family, it sounds like a very 
selfish decision. A -- A self protect -- that 
they were protecting themselves from hearing 
the horrors of what -- of what happened. 
What do you think about that? 
A: That -- Well, i-it, you know, everything is 
possible. I never really asked them why, 
you know. But, as I said, because I know that th ey cared a lot about us, maybe they didn™t 

want to hear the horrors, and the true of the 
matter is, there were a lot of horrors. I mean, 
frightening things. It™s just like I was afraid
 to tell my children 
when they were little, 
because I didn™t want them to think that th
is is what™s going to happen to them. So, I 
didn™t tell my children anything. I-In fact, my
 kids, you know, when you™re used to -- to a 
mother with an accent, they just thought, you 
know, this is -- it™s normal, and -- and then, 
you know, later on in life, when they did hear 
about the Holocaust, and every so often I 
would tell them a little bit, because I felt that
 when they were teen
agers already, they 
wouldn™t be so afraid. I mean, this is ju
st -- unfor -- an unfortunate happening that 
happened. Happened to the mo ther, happened to  the grandmother, and happened to the ga 

-- to -- to their great-grandmothers. So -- I 
did, but -- I did, you know, occasionally tell 
them here and there a little bit, but the -- re
ally, the horrors, the ho
rrors? No, I didn™t tell 
them. 

Q: How did they find out about the Holocaust? 

A: Well, you know, as they were growing older, they heard about it, and then I would 

occasionally tell them, ﬁListen, I was in Eur
ope and there was a war and this is what 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
80
  
 
 
happened,ﬂ -- you know, happened he
re and there, but I didn™t really go into details. You 
know, really them -- the frightening, the horri
ble things, I never told them. You know, I 
was, you know -- 

Q: What do you think they would learn out of lis
tening to one of the -- the last tape that 
we made, that --cause you -- I sent you copies, correct? 

A: Mm-hm, yeah, thank you, yes [indecipherable] 

Q: What do you think they would -- 

A: Well, you know, what they learn is that A,
 you have to learn to respect all kinds of 
nationalities, all kinds of people, and that youreally have to keep your eyes open against 

different types of groups, thos e hate groups, which I think the United States sort of 

ignores. We ignore, and we have them right he
re, in the United States, in this beautiful, 

free country, we giving everyone freedom, incl
uding the terrorist, the criminals. And all 
these groups, we ignoring them. But little by little
, they are just getting bigger and bigger, 

and we don™t know what the future will bring,
 how they will react. Because that™s how it 
started in Germany, with Hitler. He wa
s a nobody, and then he suddenly became a 
somebody. So, it™s -- it™s something that I think 
they would just learn to keep their eyes 
open and -- and pay mo re attention 
to -- to what™s going on around them. 
Q: But personally, don™t you think they would 
be affected, knowing what their mo ther 
went through as a child, now that 
they all have children, correct? 
A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: Don™t you think beyond the universal -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
81
  
 
 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- that they would be very affected personally? 

A: I -- I -- I hope, I hope that they are not, becau
se it™s definitely very difficult to bring up 
children, with -- with a frightening feeling, and that™s -- was my  feeling. While bringing 

up my children, it™s like I was always afra
id, God forbid, it can happen again, it can 
happen again, something can happen. And it™s -- it™
s not a healthy situation, that -- that is 
not. It™s very frightening. Not that I don™t th
ink about it now. I -- I never stop thinking, I 
always think about it, and it™s always in 
back of my  mind, and now that I have 
grandchildren, God bless them, all I keep 
praying is, ﬁPlease God, let it never happen 
again.ﬂ Oh, anyplace, unfortunately. But it™s -- 
You see, what™s happening now in -- in -- 
in -- in Serbia, right? In Croatia, or whateve
r. It™s horrible. It should never happen. But 
it™s nothing compared to Holocau
st. See, when people say, 
because there™s mass murder 
over there, it™s a Holocaust, no. It is comp
letely different. The Holocaust -- The Hitler 
times were completely different from any times 
in history. And what he did to a nation, 

the Jewish nation, is beyond explanation,
 beyond comp rehension,
 beyond understanding. 
A-A-A-And where in the world can a human be
ing, so-called, even come with such 
ideas, to systematically finish off six millionpeople, besides five m
illion of other kind of 
people, right? Different nationalities. So -- A
nd the world let him do it. Everyone just sat 
back and, well it™s not our business, right? We  are in America, so whatever™s happening 

in Europe, yeah, it™s their -- their problem.

Q: I wanted to kind of draw into a return
 to your personal life and your feeling about 
children, because I know that you™re thinking about doing a book. 
A: Mm. 

Q: And I™d like to ask you about that. Why do you think you have such a need to do a 

book? 

A: Well, simply because I thi
nk that children will be able to
 learn an awful lot from my 
experience. Since I was such a little girl and I 
had a -- I think it was quite an imagination, 
to be able to survive, alone, without a mo
ther, without any family, thinking and always 
being a step ahead of my enemy. That, I th
ink, would give the children who will get to 
read the book, you know, the strength, perhaps 
intelligence too, that hopefully they are 
never in trouble, but if they are, they can thi
nk that they can do certain things to survive, 
and not panic and think, well, you know, there™
s nothing they can do. Yes, they can do, 
because if they learn, a -- they can 
remember. And by remembering, you -- you know, 
you react differently. Like when you don™t 
know anything, you don™t know. Today I look 

at -- at children five years old, or five and a 
half, or six, and I say to my self, ﬁOh my  God, 
at their age, I already was hiding.ﬂ I knew th
at no one is supposed to know that I am a 
Jew. Yet, I knew, that in order to fool ot
hers, they should think that I™m not Jewish, I 
wore a big cross, okay? I had to hide and I 
had no place where to sleep, so the lady that 
throws me out of her house, I sleep under 
her house. And she doesn™t even know. See 
how I was thinking to survive, ha -- what
 to do. That she™s not supposed to know, 
because if she would know, she would -- cert ainly wouldn™t let me sleep under her house, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
83
  
 
 
because she was afraid. But yet -- But yet, I did 
it, cause I wanted to live, and I wanted to 
survive. I also knew that -- you know, that I s
hould never walk on the same street twice. 
People should not suspect that maybe I™m a 
Jew. And a Jew is being killed, so -- 
Q: This is a little beyond the point, but I -- I 
still wonder, even after our first interview, 
how you ate.  
A: Oh. 

Q: How you fed yourself, and how you kept your
 clothes to look something less than a 

bum. 

A: Well, you know, the clothes that I have -- that I was wearing, wasn™t even mine, 

because I don™t know if I told you or I told th
e museum, is this was when we were taken 
to be killed. And so we were completely 
undressed, except for the panties -- underwear. 
But, when we got to the slaughterhouse, wh
ere they did the killing, the mass killing, a-
and my mother spoke to this SS person, aski
ng him if they kill Ukrainians, too. And she 
gave him the whole story, that she was on her 
way with her two girls, to this town, which 
-- which was not too far from where the killi
ng wa -- was going on, to see her husband, 
who was in jail. And he believed her, and then
 he put us inside the slaughterhouse, we 
should wait until he brings in a translator, a Uk rainian translator. And then, after he told 

the translator to take us back
 to the city, we needed clothi
ng, we were naked. So, he took 
my sister, told my sister to go outside, a
nd they had mountains, hills of clothing, from 
everybody else. And so she picked whatever 
she thought would fit me, herself and my  
mo ther. And so, this is what I was wearing, 
which was a pair of boots, short boots. And I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
84
  
 
 
had knee highs, a little sir -- short skirt, a sweater and a little jacket and a scarf. This was 
my clothing. And I remained with this cl
othing until the end of the war, which was from 
™41, that™s right, okay? ™41, so when we we
re -- the second time in the ghetto, of course 
my  mo ther washed it, you know, and cleaned it,
 okay? But, after I was on my  own, the 
six months, I never took it off. I slept this wa
y, and I wore it during the day, cause I had 
nothing else to wear. You have -- I had no place 
to take a shower or a bath. So that™s how 
it was. Unfortunately, if you rememb er I told 
you, that although I stayed with the lady for 

two weeks, I was infested with lice. And that 
is because the only time that I got a bath is 
when my  mo ther brought me in two weeks befo
re. So that day, sh -- that evening, she 
gave me a bath. But then, the other two weeks 
that I stayed with her, she didn™t give me a 
bath. So, I became infested with lice. And so, when she ask me to leave her house, I 

walked out, and I went to our friend™s, which 
we used to visit every so often. We bought 
our house from them, and I rememb ered where my  mo ther u -- my  mo ther, my  father, 

when we used to go visiting them, and I w
ould walk the same way, they were on the 
other end of the city, I -- you know, I don™t rememb er exactly how long it took me to 

walk. But I walked, and I -- you know, I -- I went 
to her and she realized that I was s -- I 
was infested. So, in the winter -- it was alre
ady in the winter was very, very cold, she 
took me into her barn, undressed me, took my  clothes and hung it outside, so everything 

can sort of freeze. And she sh
aved my head, and -- and she gave me a bath and she put 
cream over my head, because I had, you know
, rashes. I had blood, abs -- just blood 
already, dripping down my  -- my  head, because 
it was so itchy. And I stayed with her for 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
85
  
 
 
a week, and then she said I have to go. So, how
 did I survive? Well, I used to go every so 
often to our neighbors, Gentile 
neighbors, cause there were no Jews already, in the city. 
So I would go to them, and they would give
 me bread, maybe potato soup, a glass of 
milk. Sometimes they™ll give me fruits. Now,
 this kept me going. So, I didn™t go every 
day to them, you know, I couldn™t be seen going to the same place all the time, because 
then they™ll be always someone who will det
ect, and feel, you know, that this must be a 
Jewish kid. So I -- I -- this was always in my 
mind, I have to be very, very careful, and I 
was. So whatever they gave me, I made su
re that I just save enough to have until I go 
again next week, or you know, or two weeks later. So, that™s how I a -- and I -- I -- I 

always tried to go to different neighbors,
 and one shouldn™t know if, you know, that I 
went to this one or that one. 
That™s how I survived. Oh God. 
Q: You mean, you were that young, and they -- they didn™t wonder where -- where you 

stayed? They didn™t ever ask? 

A: Never asked, no. 

Q: Do you think they knew? 

A: Well, they knew that I am somewheres, ri
ght, but you see, they just, I imagine, didn™t 
ask, because there was nothing they could do 
about it. They would not ask me to stay 

with them, because they were 
also afraid. So, if I came and I just -- could you give me -- 
you know, could you give me something to eat,
 do you have something? In fact, if I 
rememb er correctly, I don™t rememb er even walk
ing in into the house, but rather, staying 
outside in the back and they would bring 
something out to me. Do you understand? So, i-

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
86
  
 
 
i-it was -- I -- I -- I think it was quite fright
ening for them, you know, worrisome for them 
to -- to deal with someth
ing like this, because you know, they could not comp letely 
ignore me, and they could not comp letely reject
 that I -- if I™m asking for food, so they 
gave me the food, which was -- that was very nice. If not for them, where would I be 

going to eat? I couldn™t go to strangers. But if
 you -- I don™t know if I mentioned that last 
time, one day, it™s been awhile and I ha
d no food, and here I™m walking, you know, on 
one of the avenues, and there™s a restau
rant and it has a very big window, a glass 
window, and people are sitting a
nd eating and I™m so hungry. I -- I imagine -- I -- I -- it 

mu st have been I didn™t have enough food, re
ally, left. So I™m standing at that window 
and I™m -- I™m looking in and I see there™s pe
ople sitting, there™s one seat available, by 
the counter. So, I walked in, and I just we
nt over and I sat down. And I™m sitting down 
next to a gentleman, a -- I don™t know him. A-And the young lady, the waitress, came 

over and asked me what I wanted. Well, you know, I always rememb er that I™m not 

supposed to eat things that are not kosher. 
So, I asked her for potato soup. So, potato 
soup has nothing, it™s just water and potatoe
s, and carrots maybe, maybe. And so, she 
was -- she thought that I was together with th
is man. So, of course, she served me, she 
brought me th-the -- the potato soup, and I fi
nished eating it, and she came over and she 
said, ﬁYou -- You™re paying? Are you paying?
ﬂ And I said, ﬁI don™t have any money.ﬂ 
Which I didn™t, because the hundred rubles that
 my mother left me, I -- I bought myself a 
cross, so I can fool everyone. So -- And I st
arted crying. So, the gentleman just took the 
bill from her, and he said nothing. I think he 
may --  maybe he realized that, you know, or 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
87
  
 
 
maybe he just thought I was an orphan, or 
maybe he just thought -- well, he couldn™t 
even know -- he -- he couldn™t really know th
at I was Jewish, because I had that big 
cross, and I made sure that everybody sees it,
 okay? And then, I don™t look Jewish either. 
So, he mu st have thought, you know, this ki
d is just an orphan from somewheres, 
whatever, and -- and he just said, ﬁIt™s oka
y, it™s okay,ﬂ and I was crying, and I just 
walked out crying. But at least I had the s
oup, and I had the potato -- I mean, the potato 
soup, which was -- I don™t know how long it last
ed me, but that™s how I managed. But, 
you see, so children can learn. 
Q: You were six? 

A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: I know today, that if we saw someone w
ho was six or seven wa
lking alone, we would 
go about them. I™m wondering, were there lo
ts of other orphans around? Were -- Were 
you the only one, or -- 

A: Well, I -- I saw my self only walking 
around. I didn™t see other kids. I mean, you 
know, maybe they were on different streets, but 
as -- again, as I told you before, at that 
time, the city didn™t have already, any Je
ws, because they had already a second pogrom. 
That means they finished
 off the rest of the Jews that they did not kill in ™41. See, we had 
-- There was a pogrom in for -- in ™41, and th
en in ™42, a second one. So, at that time 
already, maybe there was, you know, hiding here
 and there, but I haven™t seen anyone, so 
-- that I know or -- or suspect,  or anything 
like that. I mean, I wasn™t in touch with 
anyone. I just live in my  own world.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
88
  
 
 
Q: I -- I want to go to the present world fo
r a minute, because before we started, you 
mentioned a movie that you had seen recently. 
A: Yeah. 

Q:  I™d love to hear what you thought, and tell me what movie it was. 

A: Yeah. Well, the movie was ﬁLife is Beautiful.ﬂ You know, it™s -- it™s amazing the way 

that Mr. what™s his name, th-the actor and 
director [indecipherable] put it together. He 
truly was a comedian. I mean, it™s -- yeah, 
you know, if you take a -- every survivor will 
have a different story, because there were 
so many happenings. Now, what he did, was -- 
was truly a -- an exceptional thing, to hide a 
child in the concentration camp. Now, it is -- 
if it™s true, it™s truly an amazing thing, that 
he was able to pull it off, sort of, you know? I 
did most of the time, I cried, yeah, mostly. 

Q: Did you identify with the man or the boy? 

A: The boy, you know, the boy. It™s, you know, 
hiding him, but -- except you see, the 
difference between the boy and my self is that 
I was alone. See, he had his father, he had 

that security, that protection from his fathe
r. Although he knew that there is -- that there 
were dangerous times and he™s in
 a dangerous place, but yet he
 had his father there. I had 
no one. I was alone. And I had to think of how 
to save myself, of how to survive. And I 
think that -- that™s it™s something. When
 I think about it now, I-I just don™t understand 
how I did it.  

Q: In -- Any particular scenes in the 
movie that really touched you the mo st? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
89
  
 
 
A: You know, the idea is that he™s in conc
entration camp , and at any minute, somebody 
might, you know, there™s the -- he™s hiding,
 and they might kill him. You know, you 
always want everyone to survive. I wouldn™t 
want to see anyone killed. I™ve seen already 
enough horror, so even the movie, to me it™s 
like I was sitting and saying, ﬁOh, I hope he 
survives, I hope.ﬂ I didn™t know what was comi
ng, but I was hoping, of course, that he 
survives, and -- which he did, and I was very 
happy at that, and at the end he meets the -- 
you know, he finds his mo ther, and that™s -- that
 was really very nice. That™s something 
like my  -- my  happening, you know? When I saw my  mo ther, that was very nice. And my  
question was, ﬁWhy did you leave me?ﬂ Y-You 
know, during that time, I never cried. 
Can imagine? I was alone for six months, and 
I never cried? And then when I -- when I 
saw my mother, a -- 
End of Tape Four, Side A 
Beginning Tape Four, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of 
tape one, side B, Frima Laub. 
A: And so, you know, all this time, I knew I™m 
not supposed to cry, I™m not supposed to 
comp lain, I™m not supposed to do all these 
things. And so, when I finally, you know, got 
together with my mother, and she sees me wearing the cross, she says, ﬁMy child, what is 

this?ﬂ And I says, ﬁI wanted to live.ﬂ And then
 -- No, she took it off and she gave it to the 
priest of the town. And then I said to her, I™m look at her, I says, ﬁMama, why did you 

leave me?ﬂ Well, she explained to me -- I da -- 
well, when she left me with the lady, she 
said to me, ﬁI got to go,ﬂ she said, ﬁbut 
I can™t take you right now, because it™s very 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
90
  
 
 
cold.ﬂ And -- And I -- I understood, except I 
certainly didn™t want my  mo ther to leave 
me. So my excuse was, I says, ﬁMom, I have
 a headache.ﬂ And she said, ﬁThe lady will 
give you an aspirin, you™ll feel better.ﬂ And sh
e said, ﬁBut -- But in 
springtime,ﬂ she said, 
ﬁI™ll send someone to pick you up and bring you 
to me, where I™m going to be.ﬂ And that 
was that, and she walked out. She gave me a kiss and she walked out. 
Q: Do you feel like she made a mistake? 

A: No. Mm-mm. 

Q: If it had been your child -- 

A: Oh, please. 

Q: -- would you have done that? 

A: No, probably not. But then, those were diffe
rent times, and as you can see, six years -- 
at the age of six years then, is nothing comp
ared today. Not even a 16 year old. I™m 
looking at our beautiful gene
ration of young Americans. They -- They -- They wouldn™t 
even know how -- what to do. This is why th
at book is very important, because they are -
- it™s -- it™s -- it™s a real happening to a six year old girl. When I think about it now, I say I 

must have been 60 then. To think the wa
y I thought, to plan the way I planned. I-I-I 
mean, rememb er I told you, one evening -- I used
 to come back very late, cause I wanted 
to make sure that everyone is asleep in 
the lady™s house, and ev -- in the neighborhood, 
so nobody sees me crawling into -- you know, to the doghouse. And one evening, the 

wom -- and I all -- it was never earlier than -- 
than 12 - one o™clock in the mo rning, cause 
I wanted to make sure that everybody is as
leep. And when I got there, I saw how the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
91
  
 
 
lights were on in her house, so, I wouldn™ t dare climbing into -- to the doghouse under 
her house. So, the house next to her was bombe d out from -- from shells, and I decided to 

sleep then -- there. Now, what happened is, 
it was comp letely bombed out, but there were 
four half walls, okay? Rubbles inside. I crawl 
we -- went in there, I lied down. I just, you 
know, sort of he-held onto my self, and in order to stay warm, I blew the -- my  -- my  -- 

my -- my breathing. I -- I blew in my air into 
the sweater that I was wearing, so I can stay 
warm through the night, cause that was winter. 
And the winters in Europe are brutal. And 
-- And that™s how I -- you know, of course 
I didn™t sleep through the night, that™s a 
different story, but that™s how I kept my self
 warm. I had no blankets, I had nothing. I was 
just lying on the rubbles.  

Q: Where would you be during that late supper night? I mean, between six and midnight, 

where would you see -- 

A: Walking the streets. I never stopped walking 
the streets. Rememb er, I used to start at 
dawn, when it started -- when it became a little
 bit light, I would crawl out from under the 
house, shake off the -- the hay that -- that 
the dog was sleeping on, and so I was sleeping 
with the dog, remember? And I would shake 
everything off, and put on my scarf, and I -- 
I did my  praying and I put on the cross, 
and I walked out nobody should see me, and I 
started walking the streets. That™s how I used
 to do, until 12 - one o™clock in the morning, 
when everybody was asleep in the area. I 
wanted to make sure nobody sees me.  
Q: Do you think that, as I see you now, as a 
very spirited person, do you think that that 
experience gave you patience, perseverance,
 daring, planning, any of the above? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
92
  
 
 
A: Well, you know what really gave me stre
ngth? And that is I always felt there™s 
someone watching over me. I mean, that God is
 watching over me. And I felt that -- that 
I™ll be okay. I-I sort of never felt alone. I felt there™s someone watching over me and I™ll 
be okay. And so, by praying, that™s how I 
felt. I pray, somebody listens to me and will 
take care of me. And -- And this is how I just
 kept going. And I felt very -- I felt stro -- I 
felt -- I never thought, you know, that I™ll get 
killed, because I already escaped two 
killings, so I didn™t think that it can happen to
 me again. But whether -- I just have to 
make sure that I™m not caught, and that the si
x months or seven months -- it™s six months, 
actually, will go by, and soon there™ll be spri
ng, and sa -- my mother said she™ll send 
someone to pick me up, and that™s how I felt it will be. So, it™s very good thinking. 

Q: Very good thinking, and a lot of faith. 

A: Yes. 

Q: And that™s a -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- another thing I wanted to ask you, I -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- I think I -- we -- we discussed your being a -- a religious Jew. 

A: Mm-hm. 

Q: And the role of prayer in helping you to
 survive the Holocaust. 
Well, what about the 
years after the Holocaust? Do you still pray ev
ery day? Do you pray for different things 
now? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
93
  
 
 
A: Yeah. Not only do I pray for different thi
ngs, but every Friday night, when I kindle the 
lights, I will stand by them and I will talk to
 God. I pray for peace on earth, I pray for 
peace in Israel. I pray for -- for health, and 
I pray for happiness, and I pray for so many 
things. I just stand there and I pray. But mo st 
of all, I do -- I really very much concentrate 
on everything that I pray and I™m asking God plea
se this and this and this and that, is for 
peace, God, for peace. And I hope we™ll have
 peace. But right now, there™s so  many 
things going on in the world, where™s the peace?
 I don™t have peace. I never live in peace. 
Q: What part of the world disturbs you right now? 
A: The whole world. It doe -- 

Q: What struggle, specifically? 

A: I mean, wherever I hear killings, it bothers me
. It just -- It just it -- it™s eating me that 
50 years later, the world still didn™t learn 
anything? Why --  Why are these things 
happening? I-I mean, there™s no reason for it. Bu
t yet, the pe-people are doing it, and the 
rest of the world doesn™t seem to do mu ch a
bout it. So, it doesn™t matter if it™s in Uganda, 
that there is killing, in India there is killing and in -- in Croatia they are killing. I just -- 

These killings just bother me. 

Q: That brings up something that the mu seum
 is very interested in -- in knowing about 
and I think last time, I rememb er, you gave
 so mu ch of your young experience in the 
interview, that by the time we got to the 
mo re post-war experience, y-you were very 
tired, and so I want to revisit some of t
hose questions that I meant to ask you then. 
A: Okay. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
94
  
 
 
Q: And one of the things which I rememb er upset you very mu ch, was when I ask you 
your response to Japanese concentration camps. Now, I™m not trying to comp are these 

things to the Holocaust, I™m trying to get your
 response, and there™s a list here, which I™ll 
just let you look, of events that happened in
 the United States, here, and if you want to 
just choose the ones that you rememb er es
pecially, and how they affected you. 
A: Well, if we™ll go to the Japanese concentr
ation camp s, are you talking the ones that we 
had in the United States? 

Q: Yes. 

A: During the war? Remember?  

Q: I -- 

A: Was it during the war? 

Q: I thought it was after the war. 

A: We were -- you know, was after -- well, after the war, no it -- it couldn™t have been. 

We™re talking concentration camps in the Unite
d States. Was that the time that the United 
States was at war with Japan? Are these the 
concentration camps we are talking about, or 
are we talking about -- 

Q: Yes. In the United States. 

A: In the United States. 

Q: These are -- These are Japanese-Americans. 

A: Okay, right, but -- but in those days, and 
I think today it probably would be the same, 
there are people who are so devoted to their 
original question, that although they are in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
95
  
 
 
the United States, they might, in some way,
 you know, react in a terrorist way. So, in 
those days, these camps, I think the government
 did the right thing, okay? Now, these 
concentration camps, you cannot compare 
to Hitler™s concentration camps. 
Q: No, we™re not doing that -- 

A: Okay. 

Q: I -- I™m just trying to -- 

A: This was strictly -- 

Q: -- trying to see how your experience -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- affected you around other big, political issues. 

A: Okay, this was a political issue. 

Q: Because not everyone felt that way. 

A: Okay, absolutely. 

Q: A lot of people felt that they were bei ng imprisoned, just because of their race. 

A: No. They were imprisoned because United 
States was at war with that country, who 

attacked the United States. Therefore, they were careful to make sure that they don™t get -

- of course, they don™t know who is a terrori
st, who isn™t and who has in mind to harm 
the United States. So they wanted to make su
re. And they just -- what they did is, they 
didn™t -- it™s not a concentration camp  the way Eu
rope had, but rather an area where they 
kept all the people that they might, you 
know, th-that they suspected maybe will do 
something harmful. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
96
  
 
 
Q: Did you -- sorry, did you --  
A: Yeah, go ahead. 

Q: -- let™s just emphasize the events -- 

A: [indecipherable] 

Q: -- when you were already in the United States. 

A: United States. 

Q: You came in 1957? 

A: Mm-hm, mm-hm. 

Q: So, do you rememb er anything about 
the Civil Rights movement going on? 

A: Yes, I -- I think it was -- it was a good movement. I think that we came a long way. I 

think it was the right thing. Unfortunate
ly, you know, the minorities had to go through a 
lot. But, they came a long way, and I thi
nk this movement was good. The Vietnam war, 
unfortunately, I think was a disaster. And that 
did bother me a lot. It bothered me because 

the truth of the matter is, we had no business to
 be there, especially losing so many of our 
young people. S -- Also, the fact that France wa
s there before, and they left it, why did 

we take it over? It™s none of our business,
 okay? And -- And -- And the truth of the 
matter is, to send our boys is, if we would 
have been -- if that country would have 
attacked us, that™s a different story. But here , that was a waste. And let™s see, which other 

one of we have here? 

Q: Kent State. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
97
  
 
 
A: The Kent State. Well, that was because of the Vietnam war, right? Because these kids 
didn™t want to stand for it, and I don™t blame th
em. That -- That war bothered me a lot. It 
still does to this day, when I go and I see that wall. That is, to me -- 

Q: Which wall are you discussing? 

A: Where they have the Vietnam -- the names of the Vietnam boys. 

Q: What upset you about it? 

A: Well, the fact that they lost their life, 
and -- and i-it™s not protecting their country. It 

wasn™t a war that we were, you know, like 
-- like -- like the Japanese. The Japanese 
attacked us, so we had to retaliate, okay? 
We had to defend ourselves. But the Vietnam 
war had nothing to do with us, really. So, 
that was an unfortunate move from the 
government, God bless them anyway. Okay, the Feminist movement, it™s okay. The 

assassination of all these big people, yes,
 bothered me very mu ch. John F. Kennedy, 
Evers, Martin Luther King, Robert Kennedy.
 That was very unfortunate, and that was 
something that I feel maybe it could have been prevented. I am not sure. 

Q: Which thing? 

A: Robert Kennedy. He was killed by -- by someone from the Middle East. And I -- I -- I 

think that what is happening that we feel that  we have so mu ch freedom in this country, 

and it™s democracy, we don™t have to worry a
bout terrorists, or killings, but we do. We 
have a lot of assassins running around this count
ry, and all -- they have freedom also. So, 

unfortunately, we lost some very good peopl
e, some beautiful people, and I™m sorry 
about that.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
98
  
 
 
Q: Who was president when you first came? 
A: It was Eisenhower, you™re right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. 

Q: Do you rememb er anything distinctly differe
nt -- of course it was different from Cuba, 
or -- 

A: Well, you have to realize that I came from 
Cuba, and in Cuba we had at that time, a -- 
a dictator, okay? And -- And I really didn™ t know much about politics. All I knew is, you 

know, that -- that, you know, that I have to work and I have to get an education and that™s 

that. That takes care on that. I -- I really 
didn™t know much about politics. And life was 

very nice and very peaceful in Cuba. So 
I -- I really don™t know much, as to, you know, 
wh-what -- what he did right, or what he di
d wrong. Reagan™s visit to the gravesites of 
German soldiers, that disturbed me, yes,
 that disturbed me very much. But -- 
Q: Tell me about that, a little bit.  

A: Well, first of all, to give such an honor, 
that an American president should go to the  
German soldiers who were at war, not onl
y, you know with Russia and Poland and the 
Ukraine and the other countries, but they were 
really also at war, so
rt of, with the United 
States, and to give them the honor of having an
 American president, that -- that -- that 
didn™t makes mu ch sense to me. I [indecipherable] 

Q: Did -- Did you discuss with other Jewish pe
ople how they felt about that, at that time? 

A: They all felt the same way. Even not -- E-
Even -- Even not the su
rvivors, I mean just 
American, you know, Jewish American people. Th
ey -- They were all definitely against 

it. They said that they -- 
those soldiers do not deserve the respect of the American 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
99
  
 
 
president. But then, you know, President Roosev
elt wasn™t exactly perfect for -- for the 
people -- for the Jews during World War Two, 
either. He was a great president for this 
wonderful country, but he didn™t do mu ch for 
us, rememb er? I mean, not even when he 
was told what was going on, and he was asked 
to bomb the concentration camp s, or the -- 
the trains going to the concentration camp s, a
nd he said, [inaudible] that™s what he said, 
they hadn -- didn™t have enough bombs or they
 can™t do it. I -- I mean, I don™t rememb er 
exactly, but i-i-it was some kind of ridicul
ous excuse. It just -- thoughtlessness I guess. 
Poor politics, and perhaps not a great
 feeling for hum-humanity, I don™t know. 
Q: Well, that™s why I was asking you, when 
your relatives, your aunts, who love you very 
much personally, didn™t want you to talk about
 it, I™m wondering if this attitude existed 
even on the part of the government. They know
 what™s happening, but at the same time, 
they™re not there. 
A: A very good possibility, but I don™t really know. 

Q: There was a lot of denial going on. 

A: Oh, oh, yes. I™m sure. 

Q: I™m even told by American Jews. 

A: Mm-hm. Yeah, yes, it was. 

Q: Have you ever heard anybody talk about that? 

A: No, not -- not -- not really. You know, lik
e -- I mean, we all felt that President 
Roosevelt did not do mu ch for -- you know, for the Holocaust. He didn™t do mu ch, he 

sort of ignored it. And well, today I guess they are a little bit different, right? They are 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
100
  
 
 
trying to prevent killings in different c
ountries today. I don™t know if they™ll be 
successful or not, but with us, they didn™t ev en let that ship of 900 Jewish -- German 
Jews, le -- they -- they wouldn™t let into th
is country. And then, of course, everybody else 
closed their doors to that ship 
and they had to turn that ship
 back to -- to Germany. Now, 
hey, today, look at it. Today we™ll let 
everyone in, including prisoners from Cuba, 
including terrorists. Everybody is welcome. 
We don™t check them. With AIDS, without 
AIDS, whatever. So, now maybe, perhaps we
™re doing already, too mu ch now, and in 
those days we did very little, or hardly anyt
hing. So, for tha -- for the survivors it is 
painful, yeah.  

Q: What kind of -- 

A: I -- I feel that the world really ignored me. 

Q: What kind of job do you think that Clin
ton is doing right now? Is he too liberal? 

A: Regarding? 

Q: Is he too liberal? Well, I guess we were discussing immigrants.  

A: Well, to a certain extent, I think he might
 be a little bit liberal. I -- I feel that this 
country deserves to have, you know, nice pe
ople, good people, responsible people. Not 
just anybody should come into a country like th
is. And that™s exactly what we are doing. 
Look what™s going on. We have terrorists, we 
have the neo-Nazis, who have the freedom 
of organizing themselves, training themselves, 
right here in the United States. Now, does 
it make sense? Do you know, as a survivor, how 
I feel? That™s why I always am afraid 
while bringing up my  children, it™s always 
behind my  ba -- in back of my  head. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
101
  
 
 
Q: What -- What did you think then, bri
nging up the subject of neo-Nazis, about 
Littleton, Colorado? 
A: Well, well -- 

Q: Happening on Hitler™s birthday. What -- Wh
at did you think when you first saw that 
[indecipherable] 

A: You know what ca -- what the first thing 
y-you start thinking is? That we™re ignoring 
them. We are giving them the freedom and late
r on might be too late, we™ll pay a price. 
Q: Ignoring who? 

A: The group. The neo-Nazis.. And this, after 
50 years, or sic -- 55 years, that they still 
admire a butcher like Hitler. Do you understand?
 And that is not from the children alone. 

These children, or these young people, they 
hear about it in their homes, from their 
parents, okay? So, obviously, there are still follo
wers. There are still those that feel that 
the people in this world are not good enough 
for them. And what do you think wa -- why 
are they training?  

Q: What do you mean, training? 

A: Well, they™re training how to kill. They 
have arms, okay? So, what do you think they 
are going to do with those arms? Let™s see in 15 years, 20 -- 15 - 20 years from now, or 

maybe even earlier. What do you think they™re 
going to do? It™s not a hobby. They have a 
purpose. It™s just we are not paying that mu
ch attention to them, cause we are giving 
them freedom. And sometimes too mu ch free
dom for criminals, you know what happens. 

We pay, later on, a price. Now, the bombing 
of -- of -- of the Twin Towers, there™s an 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
102
  
 
 
example. We™re letting in terrorists to this
 country. We™re giving them freedom, we™re 
giving them ho -- a home, we giving them ever ything, and look what we get in return. 
Q: But I -- It™s kind of hard to 
judge who -- who is and who is not. 
A: For what? 

Q: A terrorist. Y-Y-You don™t know until it happens. 

A: That i -- That -- That is correct, but no,  no, no, no, the United States, I™m sure, has 

enough of intelligence to know -- the ones that ar
e terrorists, did things before, maybe in 
a different country, not exactly in the United 
States. So, we are not really checking out 
the people that are coming into th
is country, unfortunately, okay? 
Q: What about the kids? What about the pe
ople who live here, th -- they -- they are 
citizens -- 

A: Mm-hm. 

Q: -- there are a lot of citizens, I understand -- 

A: Mm-hm, mm-hm -- 

Q: -- who are -- 

A: -- right, right. 

Q: -- arming themselves and what -- wh
at could the government do about that? 
A: What could the government do about that? Well,
 first of all, I think we have -- there™s 
too mu ch freedom in getting arms in this 
country. If you have the money, you can get it, 

and that™s number one, so right away, they 
should stop this, okay? And number two, even 
the citizens here, the ones that go out to ge
t arms, the government should know what for 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
103
  
 
 
and -- and give them a certain -- even -- and they
 have to be checked up. I think that those 
people that apply for arms should be checked out
 first, and then given a certain period of 
-- and then, you know, you have to keep an ey
e on certain people also. It™s -- I-It™s not 
easy, but we don™t seem to be doing anything a
bout it. It™s really -- there are -- the arms 
here are free for all. Any kid, any youngster, 
any terrorist, any anybody can just go in and 
get -- you know, get a gun or get a rifle or 
whatever. And, you know, it should be a little 
bit stricter. It™s true, it™s a demo cratic country, and it™s, I think to me, it™s the mo st -- the 

greatest country in the world, but it™s also
 frightening for me, even though I live in a 
demo cratic, free, beautiful country, why am I always afraid, why am I always worried? 

Because I see what™s going on and it™s -- shouldn™
t be that way. What can the government 
do? They can do. They just see -- sort of ignore it. 

Q: And I wanted to ask you about Israel as a 
state. You mu st especially have been aware 
of this. 

A: Oh yeah. Yeah, I™ve been 
aware of all these three wars, yeah. Well, what about 
Eichmann? Well, there™s a lot of these butch
ers that got away and were never caught. 
They lied to this country and they came into this country and they lived in this country, 

some of them. Of course, most of them pr
obably died by now. But yet, they live a very 

good life here, after butchering m
illions of people, okay? So th
at™s because our country is 
so wonderful, they just let th
em in and they made up stories, right? And we let them in, 
we never checked out on them, and that was that. 
As far as the wars in Israel, it™s very sad 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
104
  
 
 
that a little country like this, with a handful of
 people, especially in those days, had to 
fight so many armies, from all different fronts, and yet I look at it as a miracle. 
Q: What -- What™s the miracle? 

A: The miracle that they always beat the -- 
their neighbors. And they won mo st of these 
wars, even though -- even that war in -- in
 ™73, that Yom Kippur, when they were 
attacked. It turned around and -- but of course
, they won the war, but never peace. That™s 
different things and that™s very, very sad. 
As far as today, I feel that nobody should mix 
in, into their politics and the people of the 
state of Israel should decide, you know, which 
president is good for them, prime minister, or
 what they should do with their neighbors, 

how to find peace. And there™s no one in this 
world that wants peace more than they do, 
because there isn™t a family that
 hasn™t lost a child, a husband, an uncle, a -- a -- a sister, a 

brother. I mean, they are constantly losing people, and really -- 

Q: Are you discussing Jews in Israel? 

A: Huh? Yeah, I™m discussing the -- yeah
, and I™m discussing that nobody should force 
them to do anything, because nobody really 
knows their situation better than they do 
themselves. And as long as they don™t ask for 
help, then the United States should not mix 
in. They should leave them alone and they 
-- and they shouldn™t be peace -- a land for 
peace, they should be peace for peace. Ther
e™s no such thing as land for peace. 
Q: As what? 

A: Land, land. Like the president says, ﬁG
ive them -- Give the Arabs more land, and 
there™ll be peace.ﬂ No, no, no, no. It has to
 be peace for peace. That means the Arabs 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
105
  
 
 
have to want peace, so there™s going to be 
peace. You can give them land, no matter how 
mu ch land you™ll give them. But they obvi
ously don™t want peace [indecipherable] 
Q: You think they want war? 
A: No, what I think is they want Israel to
 move out of the Middle East. That™s what I 
think, because Israel is the only democratic
 country there. Everybody else is the same 

religion, the same background. So they just
 don™t want Israel there. What they don™t 
fremfa -- what they don™t want to rememb er is that Israel was there since beginning of 

time, and they™ll remain there. So nobody in th
is world should mix in and tell the Israeli 
government what to do, but let them and th e people decide what to do. And when it 

comes to peace, nobody wants it more th
an the Israel -- the Israelis. 
Q: Let™s go to the next. We™re moving on to tape two. 
End of Tape Four, Side B 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
106
  
 
 
Beginning Tape Five, Side A 
Q: This is tape two, side A, of a sec
ond audio follow up with Frima Laub, conducted by 
Ginger Miles, on June third, 1999, for the 
United States Holocaust Memo rial Museum. 
The United States Holocaust Memo rial Mu
seum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby 
Herr for making this interview possible. 
A: We™ll just add to, you know, the Israel™s situ
ation, as far as peace is concerned. You 
see, I feel that the Arab countries, if th
ey would only stop teaching the young children  in 
school about Israel being their enemy and the hatr
ed that they have for the Israelis, or the 

Jewish people in general, or the state of Is
rael, I think that there would be peace very 
quickly, because I imagine and I feel that th
e young people don™t want wars either. But, if 
they in -- they are taught 
since they™re very little, that
 that -- you know, the hostility 
towards Israel, so how can they grow up wan
ting peace? How can there be peace if they 
hate their next door neighbor? They don™t want
 to tolerate a next door neighbor. So, it -- 
it bothers me that we are -- that the young gene
ration of the Arab world i-is -- is already 
growing up with hatred, and -- and -- and -- and hostility against the neighbor. And 

maybe, hopefully, I would like to see someday 
that they should change their books, and 
the way they teach those youngsters.  

Q: Do you think that Jewish kids are being taught -- 

A: No, no. 

Q: -- differently? 

A: Ma -- Yes, absolutely
. Absolutely. See, hatred won™t get you anywheres. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
107
  
 
 
Q: I understand that. 
A: Okay. 

Q: But do you th -- you -- are you saying that it™s 
a one way street, and Israel, that -- th-
that Jews -- 

A: Unfortunately, unfortunately, if somebody w ould like to go to Israel and pick up the 

books that the children learn from, okay, and a -- how they™re taught about their next 

door neighbor, and then go to the Arab c
ountries, and look at their textbooks, you will 
see the difference. And -- 

Q: You™ve seen both of them? 

A: I™ve -- People have told me about it, okay? 
So, there is a difference, and -- and this is 
why I feel very strongly, that as long as 
the children are taught hatred towards another 
nation, they ca -- there can never be peace.
 Because, you know, that™s -- they grow up 
with -- always feeling that their next 
door neighbor is whatever, you know, and I don™t 
want to deal with him, and -- so, when th
e president, you know, when President Clinton 
thinks that, give them land, you can give th
em anything you want. If they hate you, they 
will hate you no matter what. If they don™t want you there, it doesn™t matter what you 

give them, unless you give them the whole count
ry, period. And that™s something that -- I 
don™t see peace in the future, unle
ss there™s a change in politics. 
Q: Do you think that -- Let™s say the book th
at you wrote about your experience, were 
distributed in Israel. How do you think it woul
d affect children, first of all, Jewish 
children? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
108
  
 
 
A: Well -- 
Q: Do you think they know about the Holocaust? 

A: Well, I think they know, and I certainly hope they do, and they should. And I feel that 

we, in -- in this country, and perhaps all ove
r the world, we waited also a little bit too 
long, you know, to teach our children, in thei
r schools, about the Holocaust. I really don™t 
know why it took them so long. Maybe because we were all in denial. I mean, it™s 

possible. Like, I -- I didn™t talk to my  childre
n, you know, about it. Maybe this is what all 
the parents did, they were all afraid, not to scare their children about it. But, I-I think the 

books are very important, because I think that now, in the 21
st
 century, I think they heard 
quite a bit about it, and -- and -- and -- and th
em -- they™re probably going to be a lot of 
books, and it™s like every survivor has a story,
 every survivor could write a book, because 
his experience were different, his horrors th
at he went through were different. And the 
children can learn from that. I 
mean, they will learn frightening things, but on the other 
hand they will also learn as to how to -- 
to survive and -- and -- and how to handle 
situations and how to try to make this
 world a better world -- place to live. 
Q: But there aren™t that many books, I don™t 
think, about children in the Holocaust. 
A: No, no. There must be some, but not really -- 

Q: I wanted to ask you about the children that 
you have worked with in a mental hospital. 

Is that what you currently do? 

A: No. I work now in a mental health c
linic. Well, you know, the children that come 
there have different problems. It™s mental 
health problems and it™s not because of the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
109
  
 
 
Holocaust. It™s unfortunate, because these child
ren don™t have a father, and some of them 
are in foster homes. I-I-It™s very sad. And they
 all -- breaks my heart, really. It™s -- It 
breaks my heart when I see thos e children, this one™s in a foster home, this one doesn™t 
have a father, this one is being abused by the father, this one™s being abused by the 

mother. It™s -- It™s -- It™s just very painful 
and I really wish that somehow in -- in this 
United States, the minorities, the ones that -- that
 don™t have fathers, that they would have 
a family life. There™s no family life, and I th
ink this is what affects the children. And you 

see, they are really lost souls. They are 
frightened, they are -- th
ey -- they -- they don™t 
know what to do, they don™t know how to cope 
with life. So, if they would read my  book, 
I think they would get well, to realize that at
 this station -- you know, at -- at this age, I 
was able to do things which they never think of doing. 

Q: Have you ever thought about, before you wr
ite the book, going to schools, and talking 
to them? 

A: I never did. And I tell you the reason. B
ecause I would probably start crying. I still 
cry. I-I mean, it™s just I -- I start talking, I™m
 reliving situations and -- and -- and I know I 
just wouldn™t be a very good speaker. I would 
just have to stop in the middle and -- and 
that™s not exactly what a speaker should do.
 As strong as I was, you know, I™m different, 

a little bit different now. I really live in
 the past a little bit, or a lot.  
Q: Thinking about when you say you live in th
e past. What™s an example of what you 
mean?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
110
  
 
 
A: Well, you see, the past never really left me, or maybe I didn™t leave -- leave the past. 
That means, everything that -- in my daily 
living, are constantly memories of what 
happened. There isn™t a day that goes by 
where I don™t -- wat -- see something that 
reminds me of what happened to me 50 year
s ago, 55 years ago. For example, certain 
homes look like a barn. You know, like they™re
 very tall and -- and those windows, or 
whatever. Well, if I pass one of those, that 
reminds me when I was only five and a half 
and we were hiding in our barn. You know, we
 were hiding from the Germans. And then, 
you know what happened. This 
neighbor of ours would bri
ng us, once a day she would 
bring us food. And then one day somebody mu st 
have seen her do it, and they called the -
- the SS, and they followed her while she was 
walking, bringing us 
food, and she started 
yelling to us, ﬁSave yourselves, save yourselv
es,ﬂ and we were, you know, o -- i-in -- in 
the attic of the barn, and so my mother a
nd sister, in the back, you know, everything is 
wooden, you know, panels, broke two wooden pa
nels, and we jump ed like two stories 
down and we ran and we escaped. So, when I l
ook at this barn, it reminds me as to what 

happened 55 years ago. If I see a German Shepherd, that really kills me.  

Q: How about you -- 

A: My stomach -- 

Q: I™m sorry. 

A: -- jumps. Yes? 

Q: No, I was just thinking of -- of German, 
and I just wondered about, have you ever had 
any German friends in America? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
111
  
 
 
A: No. Mm-mm. 
Q: Never will? 

A: No. In fact, I never will, and when I he
ar that language, it -- my stomach jumps. I 
sweat. I can™t -- the language, just the language
, upsets me so. So no, I don™t think I could 

ever -- and I™m very broadminded, really, but
 a-a-and I know that today™s generation had 
absolutely nothing to do, you know, with the past
 generation, yet and all, I couldn™t talk 
because it would bring back memories. Ju
st by looking and sayi
ng, well that person 
comes from the country that took away my  love
d ones. So, I™d rather not -- not have any 
connection. 

Q: Not even German Jews? 

A: Well, that is a little different, cause th
e German Jews had nothing to do with the 
Holocaust. Unfortunately, they 
were so -- they felt so secu
re in Germany before World 
War Two, that unfortunate, they were hit just 
as bad with the Holocaust, as the European 
Jew. Same thing happened to them. So, you 
know, it™s two different things. Talking to 
someone whose grandparents we-were involved 
in -- in my  -- in my  life, and talking 
about a German Jew, who went through almo st 
the same as the European Jew. So it™s two 
different things, you know? 

Q: Do you, or have you been able to, fro
m the beginning, or at any point in your 
marriage, been able to talk with
 your husband about your experience? 
A: Mostly he -- Believe it or not, he talks 
mo stly, about his experience. You know, he -- 
he was born in Germany, and -- and at the age of nine, my  mo ther-in-law, you know, in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
112
  
 
 
thir -- that was in ™39, she realized that it™
s going to -- it -- the situation is very bad, and 
the  sooner they get out of Germany, the be
tter off they are. And my  father-in-law was 
already, at that time in labor camp. So the only -- the only way for my  mo ther-in-law to 
get her husband out of the labor camp, is to ge
t a visa and get out of the country. So, she 
went through quite a bit, traveling all over th
e united s -- all over Germany, to try and get 
a visa, to get out of the country, and finally th
ey got a visa to go to Shanghai. And so he 
has quite an experience himself, you know, spec
ially the Kristallnacht. So, he usually 
talks about it, and I listen. 

Q: You lived in Shanghai for how long?  

A: Nine years. He lived -- 

Q: So, he speaks Chinese? 

A: No. They -- Because, you see, they were in
 a ghetto. So they used German, they spoke 
German. Perhaps they spoke a little Chinese,
 you know, when they went out to do their 
shopping, you know, in the market. 

Q: It was a ghetto set up especially for -- 

A: Yes, it was a ghetto, just exactly for the 
German Jews and the European Jews. All the 
Jews that -- that came to Shanghai. They 
all lived in -- in a -- in -- in a ghetto.  
Q: What years was he there? 

A: From ™39 to ™47.  

Q: I have interviewed a survivor -- 

A: Mm-hm. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
113
  
 
 
Q: -- who lived in -- 
A: Shanghai? 

Q: Shanghai, and Kobe, Japan. 

A: Mm-hm.  

Q: So maybe when I meet your husband toni
ght, we™ll talk about it. But, do you mean, 
when you met each other, you knew that he was a survivor, too? 

A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.  

Q: And did  you never disc
uss what happened to you? 
A: No. 

Q: Never? Y -- Does he -- 

A: As I said, occasionally, I will tell him 
some -- some kind of an experience that 
happened to me, if it relates to something else. But, no -- 

Q: Why? 

A: -- we don™t really -- I don™t really know. 
Would you believe that? I don™t really know. 
Q: I just wonder if the -- the nightmares that
 happen, after discussing it with someone like 
me, who you never knew, might be changed 
a little bit, if you shared it with your 

immediate family. 

A: You know, I think that maybe the reason why I would -- and actually, when I -- I o-

only tell strangers when I™m asked. 

Q: Oh, sure, sure. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
114
  
 
 
A: You understand? Yeah. So I think th -- I -- 
I think that the reason why it™s easier for 
me to talk with a stranger about the Holocaus
t, is because I want the world to know. And 
the reason, I think, why I do not discuss it with my  family, I mean, you know, really 
sitting down and talk about it, although my child
ren did watch the tape, is because A, I 
know my  husband went through his share of 
experiences, like starvation, you know. So, 
he went through his own, and I just don™t th
ink he needs any mo re from my  side, do you 
understand? Knowing from my side. I-I think maybe that™s the reason.  

Q: You™re protecting him? 

A: In a certain way, I think so. I think that -- 
that must be the reason. This is why I can sit 
with you and I can talk and tell you my  life, where I just don™t get to do that -- my  

husband or anybody else in the family. 

Q: I mentioned -- I mean, you mentioned th
at your children wa-watched the tape. 
A: Mm-hm, mm-hm. 

Q: Did your husband watch, too? 

A: No.  

Q: So, were you with your children when they watched? 

A: No.  

Q: Did they get back to you immediately, or -- 

A: They said nothing. Isn™t it amazing? They do not discuss it.  

Q: Do you think that™s to protect you, or themselves? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
115
  
 
 
A: I don™t know. I really don™t know. It -- It™s  very interesting. You know, I -- I never 
really asked them, and -- and they never re
ally sit down and -- and say, ﬁWell, how do 
you feel as to what happened?ﬂ Or, you know
, ﬁHow do you cope with what happened?ﬂ 
I guess they see me that I™m coping with it, 
and they see me that I™m -- I™m strong, the 
way I was, you know, the way I™m portrayed on the -- on -- on the -- on the tape, you 

know, so -- in the tape, actually. So, I don™t know. I-It™s -- It™s a good point. 

Q: Families in general, I guess, don™t 
discuss very deep things, often. 
A: Probably not. Yes, prob -- 

Q: Except maybe at funerals, I -- I think sometimes. 

A: Oh, that™s sad. Yeah. 

Q: I™m going back a little further, just so we can move on -- 

A: Mm-hm. 

Q: -- to your time in Paris. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: There were some gaps in the experien
ce. When you talked about being involved, you 
were helping Moroccan Jewish refugees. 

A: Mm-hm, mm-hm. 

Q: I wonder how you became involved with the work. Do you remember? 

A: Well, it -- i -- how very simp le. I -- I did not go to school, cause we were there 

temporarily. We really didn™t know how long we
 are going to stay, so it was a question, 

maybe a month or two, it wind up to be six m
onths, that™s a different story, but in the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
116
  
 
 
meantime, I did not go to school. And my  house was always a house where my  mo ther 
always did for the needy. She always did thi
ngs for people. So, I guess, to me that was 
very natural. If I™m not going to school, I have
 the time to help others. And that™s what 
you do, you -- you know, they need clothing, 
you -- you get together clothing from other 
people, you put it in the valise, and wicl
 -- and food, you go to bakeries, you -- you 
[indecipherable] need -- in Jewish it™s shnorer, you know that means you -- you get 

together s -- food and whatever they need. Ju
st pack it up and you take it to those people 
and you give it to them. 

Q: But I got the impression this was an organized -- 

A: No, it was my own -- 

Q: -- relief effort. 

A: No. 

Q: Your own, you -- the only -- 

A: My very own thinking, my  very own doing. 

Q: Do you rememb er how -- what -- when you saw them needy, or -- 

A: Oh, I -- Well, first of all, we -- we her 
-- we heard about those people. That™s how I 
got to know where they live. I-I don™t exactly 
remember the area in Paris, but it must 
have been outside of Paris, because it was like, on a hill. And -- And -- And there was 

maybe, in that one big room, I don™t know, ma ybe 30 people, maybe 40 people, a lot of 

them. And the smell was horrible, because ther
e were no sanitary facilities. And a lot of 

children and [indecipherable]. But I did my  shar
e. Every week, that™s what I used to do. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
117
  
 
 
And then I used to babysit for, you know, th
ey had young couples, whose wives either 
just gave birth and -- and had no help, so 
I would go and I™ll help them out, you know. I 
be like a mother™s helper, free of charge. I 
never -- I never accept any money. That was 
something that we have to do, to help others.  
Q: Now, do you -- do you take after your mo ther
 in your adult life in America? Have you 
been involved in relief efforts, or what 
kind of things have 
you been involved in? 
A: Well, you know, we always involved in 
the children™s schools. Then we always 
involved in organizations that help children 
all over the world. So, in my  own way, you 
know. Certain organizations you have to rais
e money. Certain organization, you gi -- 
send in money. Certain organizations a 
-- are ask you for clothing, you give them 

clothing, you gi -- you know, whatever, you know
, whatever you can help out with.  
Q: And you mentioned these two organizations
 as -- as their post-war agencies that 
helped you somehow. Do you recall how -- how they helped you and when. 

A: Oh yes. Sure, of course. Well, the HIAS, 
in -- in Germany, they used to give us 
clothing. I mean, when we got there, we
 had nothing, you know, there™s -- was still the 
same -- the same clothing that we had from -- you know, from -- from the -- the pogroms. 

So, they would give us clothing, and -- and f
ood. That™s that. I mean, that was very good. 
And, you know, we had a school, so we went -- 
I went to school. They did a lot and so 
did the Joint. They mo re or less the s -- 
on the same level, you know, they each one do 
their share. So -- 

Q: Do you rememb er being amazed at being helped? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
118
  
 
 
A: Amazed at being helped? Well, I guess I took it for granted that that™s how it™s 
supposed to be, right? I mean, if I need somethi
ng, they were there to give it to me, so, as 
a child it was appreciated, definitely. It was 
certainly appreciated, everything, until, you 
know, when I -- when I became an adult, I 
first realized how much effort these 
organizations put in, how -- how mu ch of ha
rd work, to get clothing, to get food, 
medicine, you know, necessary things for peopl
e who were in need. Now, of course, I 
appreciate that even mo re and I understand 
all the other organizations that are -- you 
know, trying to do the same for other people all over the world. 

Q: It just occurred to me, you have a very 
convincing aspect to your
self, engaging, that 
you -- perhaps we™re all born with a particular 
kind of nature. That little girl, I™m thinking 
about, that you were. But do you think that 
the skills, the survival skills you learned 
there, still are with you today, as far 
as the way you live your life, the way you -- 
A: Absolutely. 

Q: -- help other people get what they want? 

A: Absolutely. 

Q: Could you tell us about that? 

A: Absolutely. 

Q: Your adult -- How you think your adult was affected by that little child? 

A: Well, my adult life is very much connected  to my little girl life, because I don™t think I 

was ever a little girl, a child. I -- I feel, and as I -- you know, as I grew older, is that 

things that I did as a six year old, or a five 
and a half year old girl, was not of a little girl, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
119
  
 
 
was of a na -- a grown up person. And that is
 something that gives me the -- the strength 
today, and the understanding of lif
e today, of how to handle it. And I always say, if I was 
able to handle it then, I certainly can handl
e anything today. So, yeah, my  -- the way I 
was when I was little, during those horrible days
, is -- is a tremendous sort of backbone. 
Q: But you haven™t done any 
public speaking about it? 
A: Nope. No, I told you. I think I™m very weak
 when it comes to that. See, as strong as I 
am, and I think I™m a very strong person, 
it™s still something that I would -- you know, I 

feel I would probably constantly break down and -- and that would show my  wi -- 

weakness. And maybe -- maybe this is wh
at™s stopping me from -- from speaking, and 
this is why I -- I really feel that in a book 
I can really, really express my  thoughts, my  -- 
my feelings. 

Q: Do you keep a journal, or ha
ve you written about your feelings? 
A: Not so mu ch about my  feelings as 
to, you know, my  experience, but not, you know 
the expression, my  feelings, of how you really
 feel, but whether the story, and not so 
mu ch your feelings. This is the only thing th
at™s left from my  father, and as you know, I 
was six years old when he was killed, and so 
I™ve been without a father since then. And I 
didn™t want to leave him, and I begged him 
he should go with me, but he said, ﬁNo, you 
have to go with your mo ther, and I™ll come 
later.ﬂ But obviously it was too late. He -- If 
he tried to escape, he probably was caught by th
e Germans, by the Gestapo. So, this is the 
only thing that™s left of my  father, that™s 
the tie that he wore on his wedding day. Can you 
imagine how many years this is? Look at what -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
120
  
 
 
Q: And your mo ther kept it? 
A: Well, no, no, you see, we -- we found it w
ith some of our pictures by our next door 
neighbors. We didn™t -- We were not able to 
keep anything. When we left our home, we 
could only take the necessities. We were not
 allowed to take anything else. But then 
when we left home, neighbors went in and ea
ch one helped themse
lves with whatever 
there was. And -- And -- And some things they 
gave us back, so there was some pictures 
and -- and this tie. They gave them back, so  I-I want to show you, I ha -- we have a 

picture, on the wall, that™s -- 

Q: Did your mo ther keep that tie? 

A: Yeah, yeah, so -- 

Q: It™s beautifully woven. 

A: Yeah, isn™t it something? A-And look, you see how worn it is? You know how many 

years he wore it? I mean, I-I -- I -- It was, let™s see, how many years was it? Were they 

married when -- when my brother was over 18, 
my si -- let™s see, my brother must have 
been 18, so they mu st have been married 20 
years. 20 years, and today is -- 20 years was 
in the 40™s, so this is like 70 years old. 

Q: Wow. 

A: Okay?  

Q: What else do you want to show me?  

A: I wanted you to see the -- the wedding pictures, so you™ll see the tie. 

Q: Oh. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
121
  
 
 
A: There™s a picture hanging there. Now I have heart palpitations. 
Q: Do you really? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Do you want to stop? 

A: No. See -- 

Q: We™re looking at a picture. 

A: Yeah, we are looking at a picture. These we
re actually two separate pictures. It was 
one picture of my  mo ther, and another picture 
of my father. The picture of my father is 
the day of their wedding, and the tie that he
 is wearing at their wedding, on their wedding 
day, is the tie that I am holding in my  hand now, which is about 70 - 75 years later, that -- 

no, that™s how old the tie is, and you can 
see it™s -- it™s ripped and torn, but it™s still 

something to hold onto. And so, what I did is, 
my mother™s picture was very t-torn and -- 

and -- and -- and scratched and everything el
se, I gave this, the two pictures to a 
photographer, and he put them together. Now, th
is picture is later on in life when -- when 
my  mo ther was already a mo ther, she had my  brother at that time. So, my  father looks so 

much younger here, because he was, you know, they were young when they got married, 

but since it™s put together -- but to me, it™s a very -- it™s the only picture that I have of the 

two of them, cause all the other pictures we
re just, you know, lost, or burned or whatever, 
I don™t know whatever happened to them. 

Q: Are they both from the same country? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
122
  
 
 
A: Yeah, yeah. They were both from -- from 
the Ukraine, and they were both from the 
same town and my  father was terribly hands
ome, and one of my  granddaughters, when I 
look at her, her eyes, I always see my fathe
r. And, as I mentioned before, I-I -- I do carry 
a certain, I-I guess anger, cause my father swore 
to me that when I -- the evening that we 
were supposed to escape from the ghetto, 
I wanted him to come with me -- 
End of Tape Five, Side A 
Beginning Tape Five, Side B 
A: See, would you -- would you -- 

Q: This is tape two, side
 B, Frima Laub continued. 

A: You want to put it now, or want me to 
hold it? Would you ever think that someone in 
their 60, would still cry, because --  

Q: [indecipherable] 

A: -- because my father disappointed me. I wa nted him to go with me to escape from the 

ghetto, and we could not escape together, I mean
, the whole family together, so we really 
had to separate. So I wanted to -- 

Q: Why did you have to separate? 

A: Because a ghetto is something that is su
rrounded by barbed wire, with electrical wires 
on top, with Germans and German shepherds 
watching you. And that means, in order to 
escape, if they see too many people, then
 they suspect that you are planning to do 
something, and they™ll kill you on the spot. So, 
we had to do it, in order to escape, as 
individually, where they will not suspect or 
think you might be doing something or trying 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
123
  
 
 
to escape. So, I -- I wanted my
 father to go with me, and then -- and then my mother 
would go on her own, then my  sister would go on her own, so, you know, they -- they -- 
nobody will suspect that we are -- not even 
the people that we lived with, you know, 
nobody™s supposed to know. But he said, ﬁNo, you go with Mama.ﬂ And I said, ﬁBut I 

don™t want to go, Papa.ﬂ And he said, ﬁI 
swear, we should live to see your brother.ﬂ 
Cause, as you know, my  brother was studying in 
Kiev, he was not with us during the war 
times -- war, you know, period. He said, ﬁWe s
hould live to see your brother, I promise I 
will -- I will escape, I will go. But you go with Ma
ma first, and then I™ll go, after.ﬂ Well -
- And -- And the way we escaped is, my  mo ther
 and I, we went to a -- a secluded area of 

the ghetto, and we climbed out from under the 
-- the barbed wires. I mean, you really -- 
we really had to be very, very low, 
not to trigger the electrical wiring. 
Q: Was there anyone else with you? 

A: No. My mo ther, my self, nobody™s supposed
 to know that we escaping, don™t you 
understa -- 

Q: And your sister, where is she? 

A: No. She stayed with my 
father. Then, awhile later, sh
e did the same thing, see? 
Q: Alone? 

A: Alone, right. Well, she was already at that time, let™s see, she was 16. I was six, she 

was 16. And then -- then we made up where we going to meet, we were going to meet in 

one of our friend™s houses, Gentile -- Gentile fri
ends that we had. And so, my mother and 
I, we got there, and then about an hour later, 
also, my  sister got there. And we sat and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
124
  
 
 
waited for my  father, and he never showed up. And that was the last time I saw my  
father, is when I insisted that he should co
me with me, and he said he ke -- ﬁYou go off 
with Mama, and I™ll -- I™ll come later.ﬂ Well, he never made it. And then, after the war, 

you know, when we came back, we were all asking if somebody saw my  father. And 

some of the neighbors said they saw him walki
ng in the middle of the street with two SS 
men, and that was that. And -- And -- And nobody ever saw him again. 

Q: I want to stay with this mo ment, being angry with him -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- for that, because it -- if I were writi
ng your story, I could 
see how you could grow 
up feeling abandoned by your father, but al
so by your mo ther, who left you. And I 
wonder if you could even think for a minute. 
Has this situation repeated itself in your 
adult life? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Could you tell me about it? 

A: Well, in my adult life, I -- I always felt 
that I have to face the world alone, that I 
cannot count on anyone, not even my  children.
 That I mu st do it on my  own. And many 
times, I was thinking I have a very good title
 for my book. Always alone, and a step 
ahead of my enemy. But I always -- that™s 
true, I always feel alone, like I -- I -- I -- I 
always feel I can™t count on anyone. I don™t have
 a shoulder to cry on, I mu st cry alone, I 
mu st do things alone, I mu st build alone, pl
an alone, everything alone. But I also feel 
that, because I had to do these things alone
 when I was little, I certainly can do them 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
125
  
 
 
alone now. That doesn™t mean that it -- I don™t 
get depressed. I do. But then I get back on 
my  feet again and I just keep going, cause I know just like I knew then, I cannot stop. I 
cannot stop in the middle of the street, I 
mu st keep on walking and walking. And you 
know something else? Today, I cannot stay at 
home. I get up in the mo rning, and I can™t 
wait to get out of the house. And I want to wo
rk and I™m very busy at work, and I™m very 
happy at work. It™s very stressful job, but th
at™s a different story, a-and sometimes it™s 
heartbreaking when you see those children with
 problems. And then when I leave work, I 
don™t go home, I™m always busy in the street, doing things. And I always wonder if that is 

the part of my past, where that™s what I did 
in the morning. I got up, right? I -- I prayed, I 
shook off the hay, I put my  scarf on, my  cr
oss on and out I went for the whole day and 
then came back at night, when everybody was alre ady sleeping. I think that™s part of my  

past. And that™s what I do today, I can™t st
ay home. Always on the go, always moving, 
like a Gypsy. 

Q: Wow. 

A: Yeah. And I always said, I always feel 
alone, and that -- that is -- you know, I just 
never thought about it until you brought it up right just now. Yeah. Very much a 

connection with my  past. 

Q: Even though you™ve chosen, you™ve made the 
decision, haven™t you, not to share this 
with your husband? 

A: Maybe a -- Maybe I feel that he could 
never understand. Because, you see, when I was 
alone, I made my  own decisions. And -- A-A-A
nd I -- I felt sure about the decisions. See, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
126
  
 
 
I -- I never doubt it. I had to do something, I just
 went ahead and I did it. It -- It™s not that 
I was thinking or shivering, or -- or being 
afraid. I-I -- I knew one thing, there™s no two 
ways about it. This is what I have to do, this
 is what I have to do. And I told you -- I think 
I told you, that once during the times that I wa
s walking the streets, I walked twice on the 
same block, and I heard two boys saying to
 each other, ﬁSh -- Maybe she™s Jewish.ﬂ 
Maybe -- Maybe she™s Jewish? I never walked
 that street again. Now, nobody told me 
that, I decided. So, in my life now -- if at the 
age of six, I was able to make decisions and 
think -- I think it was an intelligent thinking,
 then I certainly can do it now. So I said, 
although sometimes I -- sometimes I feel depressed because I feel I am alone, cause I 
can™t count on anyone, because I cannot depe
nd on anyone, because I-I -- I can™t lean on 
anyone. When I look back, I did it then, and I 
say, I can do it now, too. And that™s how I 
keep going, ooh, yeah, yeah. 

Q: But you seem like you would be such
 a good friend and such a good wife and 
comp anion. So, you seem to be able to give 
it, but maybe receiving is mo re difficult. Do 
you think those other people really would like to be giving? 

A: I am -- I am a -- a giver, but again, I -- I am a giver, obviously because I saw my  

mo ther give, okay? Cause how else did I 
learn? I mean, from whom, you know? So, I am 
a giver and I enjoy giving and I do have lots
 of love, for everybody. Lots of love for 
humanity. But, you say receiving? Yes, I would 
like someone to -- to listen to my  life. I 
mean, you know, someone close in my  life, to 
listen to my  life. But then it™s just not 
materializing, so I just let it go. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
127
  
 
 
Q: You want someone to ask you, like you said -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- it™s easier to talk to a stranger, because -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- I come in and I ask you. 

A: Ask you, right. So you ask me and 
I give you -- you know, I can give you -- 
Q: I imagine your -- your children and your
 husband have no idea you would like for 
them to ask you. 

A: Maybe they don™t, and maybe they just are busy with their own lives. You know, their 

lives are so busy, with their families and th
eir children, that really, parents come in 
secondary. And that -- that is -- that is 
a fact. And my  question is, would I want it 
different? I do want that their wives and their children come first. Yeah, it would be nice 

if they would come someday and say, 
ﬁMa, tell us, you know, what you went through 

when you were a little girl. Tell us about your 
life.ﬂ And if they are not doing it, then 
obviously they don™t have the necessity. And if
 they don™t have the necessity, why would 
I want to add more responsibilities and thoughts th an what they have today? Tho, let him 

be happy, and I™ll be happy. But the only probl
em is, rememb er I keep saying? I never 
feel free. I™m always thinking of, I hope 
nothing happens, I hope 
nothing happens. And, 
will it ever go away? I don™t know. Now, I 
think even more, because I have my 
grandchildren, and I do want my  grandchildre
n to live in a beautiful world, with peace 

and -- and enjoy, because the world is beautif
ul, and there are so many beautiful people. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
128
  
 
 
It just that there is also a 
lot not such beautiful people, who might just harm you. And it™s 
always in back of my  mind. So, all I do is, I do a lot of praying. Rememb er, I told you I 
pray for peace on earth, which I think is very
 important and peace in Israel, and oh -- 
Q: But personally, we™re -- we™re -- we™re 
talking about you, personally, right now, do 
you -- do you ever pray that someone might -- 
someone close to you, as you say, might -- 
might ask you? 

A: Well it would be nice, I would like that very  mu ch. Yeah, I would, you see, so if they 

would ask me, I would tell them. Cause I think they can learn a lot from my  -- you know, 

from my  experience, but on the other hand, 
maybe -- maybe they would be upset, or 
maybe it would frighten them. Maybe it™s -- won™t be so good for them, you know, e-

every person is an individualist, and --and -- and can take things differently. 

Q: Wouldn™t it be interesting if, on the 
other hand, your -- your comp anion, your 
husband, had been all these years wondering, wh
at is it that I have not done, that Frima 
wants? What is it? All these years, that he has no idea. 

A: No, he probably does not, cause he lives in a 
different world, he lives in a world of his 
own. So he just doesn™t think that others ha
ve necessities, and he™s just, you know, he just 
has his own world. And sometimes I think we™re
 in two different worlds, but listen, we 
can™t have everything, so I don™
t expect everything from everybody. 
Q: Well, you take care [indecipherable] 

A: Yeah, that™s me, right. That™s me, and 
I take care and I give without expecting 

anything in return. Although s -- I -- it would be
 nice, it would make me very happy if -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
129
  
 
 
if there would be such a thing as Frima, he
re is my  shoulder. That would feel very good, 
because I never had anyone giving me a shoul
der, or -- you know, or being there for me, 
or helping me, you know, to cope. I -- I had to learn on my  own, how to do it, so I had a 

lesson. Unfortunately that lesson was when I 
was a little girl. That™s what I learned.  
Q: Well, you know, I think what you™re describi
ng is a -- a feeling that a lot of artists 
have, of the idea that -- that you want to wr
ite, maybe a key to open a door of support for 
you to write the book. 

A: Yeah, I -- I think so. I mean, I -- I feel th at beside, that this will give me a chance, 

really, maybe, to get it off my chest, beside 
I -- I -- I also feel that besides getting it off 
my  chest, is also feeling that I can he
lp others, you understand? I can transmit my  
strength. I can transmit my  knowledge, my  experi
ence, so they can be mo re careful in the 
future and nothing should happen to them, you 
know? Or, if things are bad, they know 
what to do, they™ll -- they™ll just, you know, th
ink, hey, she did it, I can do it. And that 
would make me happy, knowing that I™m he
lping other people, especially the younger 

people, you know, to -- you know, to learn and to 
get the strength. It™s very important to 
have strength, and believe. I think prayer is a 
fantastic thing, it really is. It can really 
make you very strong, and -- a-and very, 
you know, knowledgeable. I mean, to do things. 
Cause when you feel that -- that somebody is
 there for you, you can move mountains.  

Q: So even though you don™t necessarily feel 
the reciprocal support from your immediate 
inner circle, do you feel that from a higher being? 

A: Mm-hm. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
130
  
 
 
Q: Do you -- Do you allow yourself to receive that support? 
A: Yup. Well, I -- I don™t mind getting suppor
t. It™s good to know that you can lean on 
someone. It makes things just a little bit easi
er. Regardless if that someone can help you 

or not, it -- it™s -- you know, it™s good to feel you™re sharing something with someone. 

But again, when I look back to my  childhood,
 I didn™t get mu ch then, so if I don™t get 
mu ch now, it™s okay. I can
 survive, regardless. 
Q: But you talk about prayer, prayer is rea
lly putting out a petition. What about the part 
of prayer which is receiving support 
of -- a support from a higher being? 
A: Mm-hm, mm-hm. 

Q: Evidently, you can do that? 

A: Yeah, yeah, because when you believe in 
what you™re praying, you have to believe, 
first of all, you have to believe. If you believe 
in what you™re praying, then this is where 
you get strength from, and this is wher
e, you know, you are -- you are at peace with 
whatever you do, because you know -- you feel you did it right.  

Q: And have you been a memb er of survivor
 organizations or a
ny group of survivors? 
A: Well, I -- you know, I always am connected  with them. Personally involved, I™m not. 

Again, I can™t -- 

Q: Why -- Why can™t you? 

A: Because it brings back memories, and wh
en they talk about it, it brings back 
memo ries. So I think in my  own way, I -- I just cannot cope with the past, you know what 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
131
  
 
 
I™m saying? I live in the past, but yet, I get 
up -- very upset and so I -- I™m not involved, 
but I™m connected.  
Q: In -- In -- Through your synagogue, or -- 

A: Well, as I said, I -- In -- When I say 
connected, whatever they run, you know, for -- 
for the Holocaust, let™s say memorial or Ho
locaust Rememb rance Day or something, I 
mean, we go. That does not mean that I don™t get upse -- I™m not upset for a whole week 

at least, you know, because I went and I liste
ned and I -- and I saw the survivors and I 
listened to other survivors, it does upset me 
very much. And so I -- Personally, I am not -- 
you know, not involved personally, just -- 

Q: Do you feel like then, that you can™t be ope
n to their stories, because it would be too 
painful? 

A: Mm-hm. 

Q: Mm-hm. And you know that? 

A: Oh yeah. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Have you ever felt that people who were 
not Holocaust survivor
s, could understand? 
A: They can™t. It™s ab
solutely impossible. 
Q: Was there anyone in your family who you c
ould talk with? You never talk mu ch about 
your sister. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
132
  
 
 
A: We never talk about the Holocaust eithe
r. She™s in Israel right now, but we never 
spoke about the Holocaust either. 
Q: She lives in Israel? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: So you, I assume, have visited Israel? 

A: No. 

Q: Never? 

A: Never.  

Q: Is the fate of Israel, though, interest -- of interest to you? 

A: Very much so. 

Q: And how long does your sister live there? 

A: Oh, about five, six years. About five or six years. 

Q: She moved from [indecipherable] 

A: From -- From the United States, yeah. 

Q: From near you? 

A: Mm-hm. Oh, well, we didn™t live exactly ne
arby. She used to live in Staten Island, 
then they moved to Israel. 

Q: Did you see her on holidays? 

A: Oh, when they were liv -- were -- lived
 here, yeah sure, we did. But now, you know, 
things ha -- 

Q: So you were close in a way? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
133
  
 
 
A: We were -- We could not be very close,
 because there was a 10 year difference. But 
besides the 10 years difference is also the 
generation, see? So, when you™re talking 10 
years, she could never understand her little sist
er and I could never 
understand her world, 
cause she lived in a different wo
rld, so the two of us really 
lived in two separate worlds. 
The only thing that we had in common is th
e Holocaust. And we never discussed it and 
we never spoke about it, and that was that.  
Q: You know, we are all so different from the inside and the outside. When I see you 

pick me up at the train and I see that 
bright hat with flowers, and you know -- 

A: Colorful. 

Q: -- such a -- a great hostess and stuff. Do
 you think anyone knows some of the things 
you™ve shared today, about in-inside? 

A: Nope.  

Q: How you feel? 

A: Nope. 

Q: How serious you are? 

A: Serious in what respect? As -- My feelings? 

Q: Uh-huh.  

A: I don™t -- 

Q: Well, you live with a lot of the pain of the past. 

A: Oh yeah, yeah. I liv
e with a lot of pain. 
Q: Does that not give you -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
134
  
 
 
A: And disappointment, yeah. 
Q: -- physical ailments? 

A: Well, it probably does, but then, there™s not
hing we can do about it. We just have to 

keep on going.  

Q: Of all the things that you™ve mentioned to
 me, it seems that your job is the -- is the 
place where you feel most that you can reach out -- 

A: Mm-hm. 

Q: -- and understand. 

A: That™s correct. 

Q: Do you feel your experiences have made you a -- a mo re -- a person who can 

empathize with the people in pain? 

A: With pain? Probably, yeah, probably. I 
-- I -- I think that, you know, every unfortunate 
experience can connect you to somebody else, 
with his pain, cause you™re sharing -- 
there™s a pain, and you can understand, you can 
sort of feel it, even it™s a different 
experience, but it™s a painful one. So, th
at™s correct, yeah. You know, you sound like a 
psychiatrist. 

Q: Well, I™m not [indecipherable] psychiatrist -- 

A: Oh, that™s [indecipherable] 

Q: -- I mean, well therapist, I mean. I so
metimes play therapist for my friends. 
A: Yeah, yeah, you need -- 
they need that, too. 
Q: But I think it™s interesting what makes some
 of us identify mo re with people in pain. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
135
  
 
 
A: That™s correct, yes we do. But 
then also, it™s the person™s nature. 
Q: It™s also our nature. 
A: Yeah, it™s also our nature. 

Q: Regardless of whether -- 

A: That™s right. Some people might go thr ough experiences, and yet not be able to 

connect themselves to somebody else™s pain, 
you know what I™m saying? They just feel 

theirs, that™s it. They don™t feel anybody else™s
. But then, other people feel other people™s 
pain. Now, I feel very much pain when -- 
when I hear killings, when innocent people are 
killed. Even here, somebody is pushed on the tr -- 
into the tracks. Or th
is mother with the 
four boys that are walking on the -- on the -- on 
the tracks, and these things give me pain, 
and -- and -- and s -- pain, a -- I mean, really pain, physical pain. It™s like as if I would 

know them or they would be part of me, or 
belong to me. That™s the pain I get. And it 
takes me awhile to get them out of my  mind,
 cause I always think about them. And every 
time I think, I will sigh. And I remember I used 
to work with a Black 
girl in my -- in my 
job that I had, and we were working in 
the business -- business office of the Brooklyn 
Jewish Hospital, and every time she would he
ar me sigh -- sigh, and why would I sigh? 
Because every time if I thought of someone w
ho just got killed, or -- or someone who 
just got stabbed, or someone something happe
ned to, innocent people, that hurts me very 
mu ch. I would sigh and she would say, ﬁFri
ma, you cannot do that, because with every 
sigh, you are aging five years. So think a
bout it,ﬂ she said, ﬁbefore you know it, you™ll be 
full of wrinkles. Stop,ﬂ she said, ﬁstop sighing.
 Think about yourself.ﬂ I says, ﬁI™ll try.ﬂ 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
136
  
 
 
Well, I can™t do it. I still sigh. But she -- that™s
 what she used to tell me, every time, she 
says, ﬁYou are sighing again? That™s five years older.ﬂ  
Q: So, mo st of your friends are not survivors, then? 

A: Not most, no, not most. Some. Some are survivors. 

Q: And with those you don™t discuss? 

A: No, nope. As I said, we don™t really sit dow
n and talk about experiences, but if we™re 
together and we™re discussing some kind of a 
situation in -- so someone will say, ﬁAh, 
well I did this and this in ™41, and I did this 
and this in ™42,ﬂ and that™s it. Only what™s 
pertaining to our conversation, or the situati
on. That™s it. We don™t really sit and talk 
about it. 

Q: Have you been to the Memo rial Museum? 

A: Yeah, sure. 

Q: I know you have, but did you go with your family? 

A: I went with my  husband. 

Q: Did you all have a discussion after going? 

A: Well, usually we were discussing why 
we would stop and -- and look at certain 
pictures, and we would discuss the horrors. And th
en of course I start crying, so that™s the 
end of the discussion. 

Q: And how did he respond when you cried? 

A: Nothing. I guess, you know, they feel you 
have to cry sometimes, if that makes you 
feel better -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
137
  
 
 
Q: [indecipherable] 
A: Not exactly, doesn™t make me feel better, but I -- 

Q: No arm on the shoulder? 

A: No, no. 

Q: Maybe he wanted to cry, too. 

A: Maybe, but -- but again, that™s probabl
y how -- how people feel. If you are crying, you 
need that cry, and maybe by crying, you™ll f
eel better. The mat -- matter of fact is, you 
don™t feel better, but you can™t help it. It just
 comes on because it really hits you inside. 
You are looking at something that -- that you lived with, or similarly, you know, it™s -- 

it™s -- it™s a connection, so -- but that™s what it 
is, that™s what it is. So hey, we can™t stop 
on -- on ceremonies, we haven™t got the time. 

Q: Do you think that if the mu seum was givi
ng i -- a special exhibit on child survivors, 
and you were asked to participate in a group -- 

A: Yeah, I would go. 

Q: You would? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: How would that be different? 

A: Again, it would be because I feel th
at I™m giving something that™s important. 
Q: I think they are doing that, by the way. I th
ink they are having an exhibit in the future 
on -- 

A: On the children? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
138
  
 
 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: I would come down. 

Q: Yeah. And I™ve interviewed -- since I met you, I went -- I -- I met you in Novemb er, 

and then I went to -- I was in California in January, to visit my  uncle, but also 

interviewed a child survivor. 

A: How old was that child? Must have be en older. I think I™m one of the youngest 

survivors in this world, I think. 

Q: Yeah, I think you mu st be. 

A: I think, cause it star -- the war -- World War Two started, by us, when I was five years 

old. 

Q: Yeah, she was 60-something -- 

A: So -- 

Q: -- and very active in Civil Rights, and 
very -- speaking every week, speaking every 
week, and I told her I would love for her to meet you and for you to meet her. 

A: Yeah, well. 

Q: Cause I thought the two of you c
ould give each other so mu ch. 
A: Support. 

Q: Literally. 

A: That™s right. 

Q: I -- I think our lives are changed when we
 meet -- under the right circumstances, when 
we meet the right -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
139
  
 
 
A: Was she also in the ghetto, or
 she was in concentration camp? 
Q: She was -- She ended up in Denmark. 
A: Oh, okay, from a ghetto -- 

Q: Yes. 

A: -- or concentration camp? From a ghetto. 

Q: Concentration camp. 

A: Well, she was -- 

Q: Concentration camp. 

A: Oh yeah? She was lucky. See, I always look at -- 

Q: She wasn™t lucky. 

A: Well, she survived. Th
at™s what I call lucky. 
Q: Oh, I see. 

A: Do you understand? 

Q: Okay. 

A: None of us were lucky lucky. 

Q: No. 

A: But we survived, and that is already a little luck, right? So we liv
e with pain for the 
rest of our lives, because we lost an awful lo
t. We gave a lot of our loved ones away, for 
no reason. Just like that, poof. So -- 
End of Tape Five  Side B 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030

Beginning Tape Six, Side A 
Q: This is tape three, side A, of a s
econd audio follow up interview with Frima Laub, 
conducted by Ginger Miles, on June third,
 1999, for the United States Holocaust 
Memorial Museum. The United States Ho locaust Memo rial Museum gratefully 
acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for ma
king this interview possible. 
A: Yeah, you know, when you mentioned about the 
-- the lady that -- that lost her mo ther 
in the concentration camp, I want you to know that
 all my  life, I feel that I was very, very 
lucky I was not in the concentration camp s. I 
mean, as much as my life was difficult and I 
saw lots of horrors, and -- and went through 
a lot of hunger, and everything else, but the 
fact that I was not in the concentration camp
s, I always say I™m lucky, and I really look 
up to those people from concentration camp that
 -- that survived, which is truly a -- an 

unbelievable miracle. Besides that I think I™m a miracle with me, too. But, yeah -- 

Q: Well, I -- I get so amazed that people -- it 
was a miracle to get out, but then, to come 
over here, and everyone that I have interviewe
d has -- is materially secure. And that has 
always sort of amazed me. 

A: Yeah. Well, you know, I say that all these,
 you know, survivors, we came from ashes, 
and we build a castle. See, we all came with
 nothing. We had nothing, and we came with 
-- with so much miser-misery, and -- and with 
so much fright. I™m afraid to start all over 
again, but yet, we had the strength to do it,and all we were thinking is how to improve 

the world, how to make things better for our
 children. And -- And we started building and 
building from nothing, from ashes. So, I wish that other people, you know, who are really 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
141
  
 
 
down, and -- and -- and don™t have mu ch, they
 should look to -- look up to the survivors 
and say, look at them. They came from -- from -- really from hell, and look at them. They 
have a home, they make sure the children go 
for an education. They -- They live nicely, 
you know? They -- Their lives are -- I mean, not
 all are millionaires, but most of them 
accomplished something. And the accomplishm
ent is, they don™t -- they -- they don™t 
have to beg, because they all make a livi
ng somehow. And their children are all educated. 
In fact, I got to tell you this, when I lived 
in Brooklyn, there were 13 religious families, 
that™s it. I mean, in that area, 13 religious fa
milies, Holocaust survivors, all of us, all 13 
families. Now, out of these 13 Holocaust surv
ivor™s families, many of us never went to 
school. Of course, I went to school, cause I was the -- you know, I was a baby when I -- 

when I -- when World War Two started. But, 
they were already older, so when they came 
to the United States, they didn™t have the time 
to go to school. They had to make a living, 
they had to survive here. But out of these 13 
Holocaust surviving families, we gave to the 
world, nine doctors. Nine doctors, that™s w
ithout counting lawyers, accountant, engineer, 
dentist. Nine doctors. That means some of th
e families had two doctors in the families.  
Q: What is it about the Jewish culture -- 

A: Well, well -- 

Q: -- is it faith, is it intelligence, is it -- 

A: -- no, it™s the drive A, we -- those that su
rvived, had a drive, plus a little luck, okay? 
So we survived. Then, once we 
survive, we always feel that we have to improve, make 
things better. And so the drive of accomp lishmen
t is important. So these parents, even if 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
142
  
 
 
they -- they did not have an education and 
they came from concentration camps, but they 
came here and they started working and sa
ving and working and saving. And so when 
they had their children, oh, now™s my  chance
. My children mu st get an education. And 
these kids went to -- you know, went through 
all the schooling and everything else, and 
are professionals. It™s -- It™s the drive, and it™
s the fact that we want the world to be a 
better place to live. We want to be -- you know
, bring pride to the world, and -- an-and I 
wish that, you know, people would look at it and 
say, if they can do it, I can do it. And 
without even going through hell. If these people went through hell and came out from 

ashes and build a castle, I can do it, too. I liv
e in a beautiful country, I have a beautiful 
job. All I have to do is a little struggling,
 a little saving. You know? I mean, all those 
things go hand in hand. They can do it, t
oo. Especially, I think the young generation 
should look at it. See? And -- And -- And I want you to know that every family, from the 

Holocaust survivors, they take pride in
 their ch -- kids, because it™s like a double 
accomplishment. It™s, I didn™t go to school, but l
ook at my child, he™s a professional. That 
means they feel like it™s almo st as if they 
did it, too, you know? And they didn™t have the 
opportunity to do it. Ah, you always keep th
inking -- ah, when I was young, I wanted to 
be in -- in the research world.  

Q: Yourself? 

A: Yeah. But I had no one to support me, so 
instead, at the age of 13, I was supporting 
my  mo ther. I went out and I had the full da -- a full time job, and I went to school at 

night.

Q: [indecipherable] 
A: Yeah, and I went to school at night. That
 -- I -- It hurts me. That bothers me, that 
nobody in the family said, you know, ﬁWhat would you like to be, and where would you 

like to go from here?ﬂ And I knew I had a very good mind. I -- I was always a very good 

student, I was always an A student. And you know, my  mo ther took great pride in me, 

and I really tried, and I wa -- I never di
sappointed her. And yet, you know, I -- I couldn™t 
continue with -- with sa -- 

Q: How far did you go in school? 

A: No, well, no, I -- I -- I finished high school, and -- and then I came to the United 

States. 

Q: Now that™s something I was curious about 
there. There seemed to be such a almo st 
idyllic life in some ways that you described it, in Cuba. I guess, compared to the 

Holocaust, it was, and you were with family. 
But, can you think back of some underlying 

dissatisfactions that you had in Cuba? 

A: Oh well, oh well, there is always underlyi
ng dissatisfaction. A lot of it, I think, was 
due that I was -- I was angry the fact that I 
couldn™t be what I wanted to be, and that I 
wasn™t -- I was not given the opportunity to be
. Like, for example, here -- and today we 
have all kinds of grants, and -- and -- a
nd you can, you know, get a scholarship. In those 
years there was no such thing. So, privatel
y, I couldn™t go anyplace, because we didn™t 
have the money, and my  mo ther was a 
widow, and we had nothing. And nobody in the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
144
  
 
 
family even thought of -- of saying, well,
 you know, we™ll get together and perhaps 
support you and -- and -- and -- 
Q: Well, let me ask you now, Frima. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Let™s say that you got a scholarship -- 

A: Oh, I would love to. 

Q: -- for next semester. 

A: I would run. 

Q: What would you study? 

A: Yeah, I would love to be in the -- in the -- 

Q: College? 

A: No, I would love to be in res
earch. I still like to be in research. 
Q: What kind of research? 

A: See, I would love to find out something th
at can save human beings. Like cancer, like 
diabetes. I cou -- Any, anything, but mo stly
 I think it would be diabetes and cancer. I 
think these are two dreadful diseases, which re
ally need a lot of research. And I would 
really sit 24 hours a day, for that. And I th
ink I would -- I would -- I would probably find 
peace in it. 

Q: What would happen if you decided to take your money now and go to school? 

A: Oh well, now. Now, maybe my  husband woul
d think I™m nuts. He would really take 
me to a psychiatrist, and say, at this stag
e in your life -- but I-I don™t feel my age. And I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
145
  
 
 
feel I -- I have a lot of common sense. And I -- I am always willing to try things and I am 
always willing to -- to discover things and 
look for things. It amazes me, I mean, how 
mu ch we can find, if we look. 

Q: How about even just a class in something,  like even if you took a class to start writing 

your book, with this in mind? 

A: Oh, there is such a thing? I-I never looked -- 

Q: Yes. 

A: -- into that. Yeah? In writi
ng there is such a thing? Becau
se we do have in -- in this 
area, we have adult education, or continue d education, whatever you call it. Well, every 

so often I do take, you know, different types of courses, nothing -- nothing, you know, 

constructive, really. It™s just pleasure, some
thing that just is good for my  mind. But, I™ll 
look into it.  

Q: So -- 

A: I don™t know if I™ll ever become a writer, listen, I™m counting on you. 

Q: Well -- 

A: I can give you the material. 

Q: I will help in any way I can. 

A: Thank you. 

Q: I -- I would wish you great success. 

A: Thank you, I know. 

Q: And I -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
146
  
 
 
A: I know. 
Q: I wondered if there™s anything else that
 you -- you had to say. I know that you shared 
with me earlier that you™ve been diagnosed
 with diabetes. Is that a new thing? 
A: Yeah, two years ago, yeah. And yet, I 
don™t know of anyone in my  family having it. 
At least, my  mo ther. Or maybe my  father
 had it and he didn™t know and I didn™t know. 
And so -- And I was never overweight, so when 
this hit me, I didn™t believe it. When the 
doctor told me I had diabetes, I did not belie
ve him, I said, it mu st be somebody else™s 
blood results, not mine. And then, of cour
se, you know, he took another blood test and 
the results were -- 

Q: And you -- do you take insulin, and -- 

A: Not sh -- Well, right now, I™m going to one of
 the biggest I -- I -- I am told, one of the 
finest clinics, it™s called Joslin Diab-Diabe
tes Clinic, in Manhattan -- Diabetes C-Center, 
actually. It™s supposed to be one of the best in
 the United States, or perhaps in the world. 
Well, they™re trying different types of medica
tion, so every two weeks I'm on a different 

type of medication. It™s -- So far, it hasn™t
 worked. The doctor told me there™s another 
medication that just came out on -- on the mar -- in -- you know, in the market, maybe 

we™ll try that. But, as you know, I have a tremendous drive in my  life. I™m very -- you 

know, my  mind is just, you have to keep goi
ng and you™ll be okay, just hang in there. 
And I™m hanging in there. And hopefully, pe
rhaps they™ll be able to, you know, find a 
medication for me, and if not, well, if that what it takes, I™ll take the insulin. As long -- 

Q: But you haven™t started that yet? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
147
  
 
 
A: No, no. We just sort of tested it for tw
o weeks. It didn™t do mu ch. It just didn™t do 
mu ch for me. But again, you know, sometimes you have to increase the dose. 
Q: And you watch your eating? 

A: Oh yeah, yeah, but it has nothing to do with my  eating. 

Q: No? 

A: Look at this, I™m -- I™m lil -- you know, I™m
 so skinny, I lost so much weight. 

Q: No, but I mean, my  aunt had diabetes and she -- she -- she couldn™t eat sugar. 

A: Oh yeah, oh of cour -- that™s -- that™s passe. You don™t eat -- I don™t eat sugar. 

Q: So when you offer me a cake, you
™re not thinking of eating it yourself? 
A: No, never touch it.  

Q: Oh. 

A: I don™t touch it. I don™t touch anything th
at has sugar, although mo st of the things 
have a little bit. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Okay? So that you cannot help, but like cake 
is out of the questi
on and anything that™s 
sweet. 

Q: No wine. 

A: Don™t drink wine, I don™t eat watermelon, I don™t eat a lot of fruits that have -- that are 

sugar. I don™t touch, well, any of this junk 
food that might have -- or any junk food, you 
know, I™m very careful [indecipherable] I -- I -- 
I can™t really eat junk food, because right 
now my  -- my  glucose is out of control, rea
lly, so I™m trying to be extremely careful. I™m 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030
  
148
  
 
 
trying to eat as much protein as I can. But then
, I have high cholesterol, so that protein is 
not very good for the high cholesterol. But,
 you know what? Okay, and I also have high 
blood pressure, so I have the three highs. I am
 flying high. But, nothing stops me. I feel 
okay, and I just do what I have to do. I continue
 with my life. Yeah, I feel that I-I have to 
do a lot of things, because time is going by very fast. And I feel like, you know, I got to 
accomplish more, more, more 
than what I™ve accomplished until now. Cause it™s like, 
you know, 60 plus. I™m almo st there, and then -- 

Q: Almost where? 

A: Well, almo st you know, anything can happen so
me -- to someone that™s in the 60™s, or 

it could happen in the 70™s, or could happe
n in the 80™s. But I feel that I should 
accomplish more right now, while -- you know, while I still -- my mind is sharp and w -- 

I™m -- I still have my feelings and my marble
s and my determination and my explanation, 
my  devotion. All this I would like to put on paper. How about that? 

Q: That sounds wonderful. 

A: That sounds good to you, right? 

Q: A great idea to me. 

A: Yeah, okay. So, okay, you know, survivors survive.  

Q: Say that again. 

A: Yeah. Survivors will alwa
ys survive. You know that. 
Q: Thank you so mu ch. 

A: It was a pleasure talking to you.
