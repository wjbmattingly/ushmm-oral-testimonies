because Idid know all the circuit we weredelivering.  And I understoodfor whoIam 
working.  Except that this Mr. Russelinski(ph) who was the head of the organization, 

who took me in to deliver the messages, he only was aware I'm  Jewish, in the

I stillfelt uneasy taking downthe hat.  Now they're goingto church, I was aware I

A: Yeah.
 
Q:Soallthese peoplethat you worked with, the resistance, didnot know you were 

Jewishand it was 
im por t an t no t to  t e l l them ?
 

A: Yeah, it was importantnot totellthem because theorganization, we talkabouta 

political organization, underground organization in Poland.  One was called 

Akar(ph),AKandI know they killed the Jews.  But on theother sid
e,  som e Jews  
weremem bers.  Mostly doctorsand so.  Soactually everything depends on the 

person, onthe individualand if I was in this organization,maybeone wouldn't hurt 

me, but I bet there were som e would hurt me badly would they f ind out I'm  Jewish.
  
As a matter of fact my f riend was hiding in the village.  He attached him self to 

another organization, a leftist organization, where he should feel secure and he was 

k i l l ed  by t hem .
 
Q: W h y?
 
A:Becausehe wasJewish, so they killed him.  So it was dangero

area, som e Jews, there were two girls workingatm aids to Christiansand there were 

one Jewish girl whichmarrieda Christian inanother villageandthere was some
 
J e ws  
working astailors, quietly, you know this was1944, when theGermansactually didn't 

dareto come to villages likeheused to come yearsbefore.  W henthey did arrive in 

villages now, it's withbig groupsand very careful and soon and soon.  So it
 
wasn't 
sodangerous to take in a Jew for___________, like it was,for example in 1942, '43.  

I talk about little villagesfaraway wherethepartisans hadtheupper handfor the 

Germans.So som e Jews were in the villages, living half hidden, halfopen.
 
Q
:But youstayed private aboutbeing Jewish?
 
A: Yeah, yeah, in thepartisansat least, yeah.
 
Q:And sodid theyfeed you,did they give youaplace tostay, did they protect you?
 
A: T hey didn't need to feed me or give m e a place to stay, I mean in daytime 
m o st l y 
I was working withthisfarmer.  But if there was,as it called,action, we did need to 

go  som epla ce , the y l etme kno w,  com eh e rea nd th e re to a ss em b l e, to a ss emb le 

part.  W e went out to a railroad track or we had some meetings and so on, so on 

and 
daytime, even back to work,no onedid know that wearefarmers,although in

soldier?
 
A:No then one day.  Finally.  This was in July and a German soldierarrived in the 

village.  And it was obvious that he, that he escaping and he told us that is an end 

to the war.  It was already July 1944 and __________ us aware that the German
s 
areescaping,f inally they arrived inour village.  And wehave seen it, the older 

farmers left the village and went uphill, for the prepared hiding places and dig outs 

and so on,ditches, you know.  But,I was without ina hidingplaceand Ididn'tknow
 
what todobecause they didn't let in strangers,the villagers.  Andthefarm er where 

I  wo r k inga sa c o wha nd, he  wa sa wa re I'm J e wi s h and he wa s af raid to l et me in the 

last minute, you know, never know whatcould happen.  SoI wentdown tothe village 

an
d m ingled with the Germans, they were on every, on every farm.  So anyway I 
went into a farm house, pickedup a cow andtookthecow back uphill.  Onthe way, 

aGerman soldierpassedm eand he was washing himself with, hewas shaving 

him self actually.  And

later I wentdown withthe cow and to thef ield.  Andso if som ebody stopsm e,of 
course I would say I take care of the cow, this is only, you know, belonging.  So I felt 

a  little  bit safe r,b u

they're machine guns, which meant Russians about 10 m iles f rom  here and later 

when we heard single shots,heexplained,ohnow theym ust be someplace inabout
 
am ilef rom here.  And later was quietandhe said," You know what, I think we are 

liberated, because the front probably passed the village on the eastern side."  And I 

looked down to the village and of course there were no m ore Germans, but there 

weren't
 
a l ot of  Ge r m an s , I  m ean.   A  f e w of  them  a nd th e y we re  m in i n g ta nks and

So I wentdown withthisRussianto the village, looked around 
and later was walkingon the road,not beingcom pletely surethat Isurvived, butI 
have the feeling, I think this is the moment.  And f inally from far away, I've seen a 

man on a bicycle.  And
 
I wa s  won de r in g wh at  ishe do i n g wi th th ebi c yc l e  a ndh e

the Russianuniform , clean uniform .  They're lighter than theGermans, than the 

German uniform s.  He comesby, 
he drives closer, I recognize a Jewish, um  a 
Russian soldier.  He finally stopped near me and he asked me, "Germans if 

nicht(ph)?"   There are no Germans here?  I said, " No, there are no Germans here, 

t he y l eft."   S oh e tu rn sa r ou nd,  wen t ba ck .  F ew m om en t s

W e're, we're wildtoo.  W edidn'tknow what, we didn't have,talkabout kids m yage, 
you know, when the war started I was 12 years old, Ididn't learn a trade oranything 

else,m y way of thinking was completely distorted.  I rem ember wandering Lublin 

a nd I ' ve see n p o l ic em en, t wo p o l i cem e n t ha t es c o rt  a m an to the  c ou rt ho us e a nd I

him ."  So we went to the court and he did explain the court, that, that or that and, 

a nd I was n' t ab le to un der st an d it .  It wa s tom e, l i k e u n rea l .  Im e
a n he st o le a

Anothertim e, I was like anewborn inthe world.  Anothertim e, I went, I was hungry 

many times and som ebody toldme that the Catholicmonastery,nuns,the nuns, they

SoI went overthere.  Ifeltuneasy being ina Catholic institutionbut I was hungry

this spoon, a big, big spoon and gives me more soup.  And I felt that I am  doing 

som ething wrong.  I felt that I should tell her I am  Jewish, she's too good to m e.  I

The farm er once took our sh

I still can't fo rgive  m yself h o

that the farmer did not escape, he's in the village.  So now in Lublin I told them, 

" Listen, he's over there, he's not punished, what could we do about this?"  So,

And I felt good except the heat.  I, people they ask me many time
s,  wh y di d  yo u  
leave Israel and I hesitate to tell the true, because true is because was hot.  Because

.  I, even now I'm  perspiring 
and it's not hotatall here, we have air conditioning.  It'sphysical,I have something 

which is, can't stomach.
 
Q: Now did you go toIsrael because youfeltthatdesire tobe inthe Jewish 

h om e l and ?
 

A :  F irst of  a ll, it wa s  t
he only way to goout.  Thisprobably was themain reason.
 
Q:So if you could have gone...

very nervousthatI survived to thatmom ent when they arebehindbars and soon.  

Butthe nextoccasions it didn't botherme, ifIwould try todescr

they can'tattach them selvesf rom  thepastand they don't wantto.  Feel of guilt,I 

don't know, they want todo something.  I'm theone who

in19, yeah in 1957, '58, Iborrowed a typewriter, puteverything inamanuscrip
t fo rm 
and later,and this wasm y whole story, that evolved atSobibor.  Later I thought, let 

me have the opinionabout thisbook, if it's interesting.  AndIthought,who could give 

me thebest opinion?  Somebody who was inthe cam p.  SoI went straight, 
I forgo t 

hisname, he wasthe secretary of theAuschwitz organization inIsrael.  In Haifahe 

used to live.  Said, "Mr.Soand so, takethis, read it andtellme, evaluatem y 

m a nu s c r ip t."   T h r ee we ek s l ate rI go to hi m , he l oo ke da tm e .  " Oh , T oivy,  yo uh a
ve  
a n im agi na t io n.   N e ver hea r dof  Sob i bo r ,neve r  hea rda bo ut th e revo l t ."   And I 

thought, I was in shock, youknow, I was manytimes hitby the Germ ans inSobibor, 

it didn't hurt me as much as his words.  He, five years in Auschwitz, he doesn't 

believe m y
 
story?  W ho will believe it?  So I put itaway.  For about40 years,didn't 
touch it.  Forty,I don'tknow, I startedagain about, this was in 1958,about25 years.
 
Q: You put it away?
 
A: Put it away,because ifhe doesn'tbelieveme, I was thinking about
 
it  m a n y  t im e s  
and I f ind out, but I had com e at a conclusion, that he wasn't really a good person to

evaluate.  He was closedup in thisAuschwitz.  He didn't know the complexity of the 
Holocaust tragedy.  And in a way, despite what you,many peoplethink
, it wa s mu ch 
wo r s e  out s i de th e c am ps , i nm an y cas es , th an  in  t he  cam p .  In  the c am p you wa s, 

youhada good jobover there, you was secured ina way, youdidn't know, you could 

visionanother dayand so on, soon, soon.  If you werestrong, youwas able 
to .. .  

And on the other side, hiding as a Pole in the forest, you wasn't sure every second 

of your life.  Sohe didn't know this aspectof course.  Hedidn'thear about Sobibor.  

Cause he went straight to Israel and so he was hidden.  They tried to erase t
he 
mem ory of Sobibor.  Poland didn't care.  W hy should they expose, even now they 

didn'ttake, theydon't takepeople, why should they exposea place where the Jews 

foughtback the Germans?  Theydespised Jews, the cowards.  W henthere were 

somany Poles i
n  c am ps and  t he y di dn' t f i gh t ba ck.   S o Sob i bo r  wa s p us he d a wa y 
andIactually put it back in the view.
 
Q: So one man said that you and you, did you think m aybe I did im agine or maybe it 

wa s n ' t. ..
 

A: No, I know I didn't imagine.  As a matter of  fact in m y 
book which I wrote now, 
which willbe publishedby Northwestern University in thespring next year, I elim inate 

many things from  the manuscript to m ake it more believable.  Because it took 

m iraclesto survive theNazis, so.
 
Q : So  the t im e th at  you p ut  you r
 
manuscriptaway, did you thinkabout it?
 
A : N o .  P u t i t awa y.  A c tu a l l y i t wa s a l wa ys  in m y, i n m y su b c o n s c io u s .  I t st a rte d

just tell you that, that we setout, whenI hadalready set,thefirst version which they 

allowedm e to change on the sign, only  we pay money, wedoit, the Polish didnot 

want to put a penny, the cost was and I had about 25,000 dollars to m y disposition 

f rom the collection American.  Thefirst versionwas tochange that, in thisplace were 

killed250,000 JewsandPolesand Ithought this is thebestof it and Iaccepted it.  

B ut  
later itdidbotherme.  I said," No, Jews and Poles,it'snot so.  There weren't 
Poles there."  The argument f rom  the Minister of  Justice was that there were for sure 

converted Jews.  As convertedJews, they were Christians.  SoI toldhim  inthis

already, they accept it and I said, "It's okay.  1000 Poles will show, 250,000 Jews,

Q: S
o do you talk to  other Holocaust survivors and encourage them  to speak out or 
do som ething that's meaning, something that's meaningful to them?
 
A: No, the fact is, that the survivors f rom  the death camps, act completely different 

than survivors f rom  conce
ntration camps.  Concentration camp survivors have 
society's mauthausen(ph), prisoner's, Auschwitz organization and Buchenwald. 

Younever hear ofSobibor orTreblinka organization.  Or Helnot(ph).  First ofall,

likethat if this would bethe Nazi tim e.  Ithink whatIhaveseen,more thanhalf  would 

give up the child.  Anyway, I have little observations,I wouldn't call it lessons about

have more time and maybe I will write short stories, but this, would rather be, I think 

in a fiction form, based on true stories.  That's all.

Q:But your, the childrenthat wereborn here,did you bringthem up Jewish?

A: Yeah.
 
Q: How does, how's Godnow?
 
A: Iam at odds withGod.  Somuch Idon't want to talkabout Him , that's God.  There 

is some, obviously, I lean,I lean rather toSpinosa(ph), __________.  You know who 

Spinosa(ph) was?  Jewish philosopher.  He was thrownout in Jew's society, you 

know.  There is some,you could say I'magnostic,notatheist.  There is somepower

imaginable God, which did com e from different religions.  But again, how could you 

beatodds, if youdon'tbelieve in Him.  So, put it this way,I'm anon
-
believer, but a 
Jew.  Some say you can't b

past.  But why not?  You couldbea Jew, you don'tneed to bea religious Jew.

tofight, get a divorce, so on, soon.  Soeverything is, younever could set som ething 
inonesetand will run likethat.  Som e experience inm y life, which what?
 
Q:W ell,the im po rtan tpa rts, the  inte rvie w tha twe  wa
nt to do isto findout what your 
l if e has be en l i k e,  how t h e e xpe r i en ce of  th e Holo cau s t ha s de te rm i ne d yo ur 

experience?
 
A:W ell the experience of the Holocaust f irst of  all make m e a agnostic.  The 

experience of the Holocaust, not so, the history of the human beings, which I studied 

very carefully, history of Jews,historyofthe worldand soon, makeme wonder ifit 

c ou l d happe na ga in .  An d I think  it c ou l d ve r y ea sy hap pe na ga i n.  Firs t of  a ll , if  yo u 

learnf rom history, it'sa very well, a very well kn
own saying, history repeat him self.  

W hy should it stophere?  And it'sproven, thatthe__________, our culture,didn't 

putastop to it.  As a matteroffact,the technology made it worse.  Nexttime 

s om eth i ng wi l l , som et hin g h ap pen ed , the r e 'l l  be  com p ut

t o sa y I'm no t tha to r tha t.   You pu sh th e button , the y ha ve yo u r wh o le s to r y.   S o it 

could happen.  You could see thefeeling against Jews is not, you scratchitin some 

societies andcomes up, without scratching itcomes up.  People willalways hate the 

smarter, the very well off and people will always lookforexcusewhy theyare 

m iserable.   So if  like Jews, anation didn'thave anybody to protectthem  inthattime, 

you couldfell easy prey tohate.  Now we have Israel, which 
in a way could protect, 

but from m y experience, I don't talk, I don't look the positive way on the future.  I
