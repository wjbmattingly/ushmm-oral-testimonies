couldn't stay, work without eating...in evening we
 came home and slept and in the morning at

work. And we 'd work like this ma ybe for a whole 
week. On Sunday we'd return home and from M
onday to Saturday, we stayed at the winery. 
We 'd come  just to sleep at home. My father al
so. Sometimes he would al
so sing at a wedding, at 
a ceremony. We  had a pig, a few chickens near th

little bit to find some  money for clothing, for food, to buy whatever we couldn't grow near the 

house. My father was taken to the army.

A: On ______ Street we used to live and 
we had good neighbors. We ll, our child...we had 
our childhood friends, boys, girls. Maybe he was 
living the second or thir
d house over from me .  
 
Q: Was this a gypsy neighborhood or mixed? 

 

A: No, there were Roma nians living there too. A
nd at night when they came to pick us up... 
 

Q: Yeah...but tell me  before...when you were ma rried, what year? 

 

A: 1942. 

 

Q: Tell me a little bit about what happened after the war started. 

 

A: Well, the war I think started in '41. 

 

Q: Yes. And you got ma rried in '42? 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: And what happened afterwards? 

 

A: Well, what happened afterwards? My father wa
s drafted. We  were left with my mother at 
home  and, of course, she cried, we cried when my 
father left and afterwards in '42 when they 
came around one or two in the morning to pick 
us up, my mother, my husband, and my sister 
were taken away. My sister al
so. Also they took my brother'
s little sister. She was young. And 
when they came  they told us to get dressed. 
The police came in the morning...one or two in the 
morning when we were asleep they came. They
 kind of raided the w
hole neighborhood. We  got 
up. We  got dressed. I told them that my mother 
was drafted. My mother showed them all the 
papers. No, no. We  have to go. And they picked 
us up, but they also picked up other neighbors. 
Yes. Yes.  

 

Q: Not just gypsies?   

 

A: No. No. No, no, no. They only took the gypsie
s. My next door neighbor wa s Roma nian. 
Yes, he was Roma nian. We grew up together, 
but he...they didn't pick him up. No, no. They 
didn't pick him up. He was not on a list. So they 
before came and registered all the people, ma de 
a list of people. Yes, yes. Some body came and 
took the name s down, a policeman, and ma de up 
a list. I told him let's not put our names dow
n, because you ne ver know what's going to happen. 
And that's why I'm alwa ys afraid. And he said 
we ll, if everybody puts their name  on a list, why 
should I not?  I don't want to be left all by myself
 here so anyway he put his name  down on a list 
too for all of us. 

 

Q: And where did they take you wh
en they picked you up from home ? 
 

A: They took us to the police station. They t
ook us there. The first roundup...we were in the 
first roundup. We  were taken to the school. Then 
another batch of people came  and then a third 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0165

one and when the second and third round of pe
ople were...the third round 
of people were taken, 
they started ma king so much noise that they di
dn't  take them anymore. They broke windows. 
They really created a stir. So
me  had children. We also had ch
ildren, but we were quiet, hoping 
that they'd let us go. So other pe
ople whom they had just taken but
 started creating a ruckus, they 
sent them home . Now I 'm sorry 
too. How come  we didn't make so
me  noise too? Maybe we could 
have gotten away from being sent away. So they
 came. They took us to the school. My mother 
was comi ng, crying, to let us go. They didn't. My 
mother showed all the papers about my father 
being in the army and they said well, ma ybe th
ey'll be freed later on. My mother went to the 
police. Every where she showed the papers...nothing. 
So we were taken away. We  stayed at the 
school ma ybe about two days and then they took us 
to Socora (ph). They...in Socora they put us 

on a train. It was a long train. It 
had brought people from all over, not...many cities, not just us. 
And took all of us who were there in that neig
hborhood who were on the lis
ts, but not the others. 
The others were returned from that school b
ack to home . So they loaded us in cars... 

 

Q: Were they freight cars or passenger cars? 

 

A: No, that was for cattle...cattle cars...for for fo
r cattle. So they put us in there. We  stayed 

about a few...a while, just...they cl
osed the doors and they let us out
 just so we wouldn't...so we 'd 
use a bathroom. We left. We stopped by 
_____, ______, and we got all the way to _______ in 
these closed cattle cars. Fr om there when they 
opened the the doors and th
ey left the doors open, 
and we kept going. From the train 
we could see all kinds of thi
ngs, and we got to a point...I 
thought they  were trees and wine
ries, but no...they were people who 
were in this place, had been 
there for ma ybe a week. They were just gathered there.  

 

Q: Were they gypsies? 

 
A: Yes, yes. Gypsies from a ll over. Whe n I sa
w from the train all these, we started crying. 
We were really crying, and we saw a long, long 
ditch. It was long, long, 
long, like the train. We  
stayed there until the night fell. We didn't 
hear anything. Nobody told us anything. We only 
heard the trai n whistle and felt it star t and the so
ldiers who were there, rema ined down. We  didn't 
know what would happen to us or what the soldiers
 would do or that they would throw us in the 
trenches. After us ma ybe some thing happened 
and they they threw the people down in the 
ditches. We got off at that place wher e ther e were so many people assembled, and some military 
soldiers came and they ma de us wal k about two 
days. We  walked about two days. And then we 

rested.  

 

Q: Tell me  a little bit how this ma rch, when you walked down...tell me  what happened?  

Well, you know...just tell me  a lit
tle bit how the ma rch was? 
 

A: Well, we walked day and night without a
ny food, without water, without anything. If you 
saw a little bit of water 
like a puddle and if you wanted to kn
eel down to drink some , they would 
shoot you because there were two guards or some thi
ng like that with weap
ons, with arms , so if 
you stopped to drink the water, they
 would shoot you right there. So
 we just continued walking. 
 

Q: Did you see people who were 
shot?  Did you hear shooting?

A: No, no, no. Because everybody knew that if it we
re after...the  guards were after us. There 
were soldiers along side us, so we saw that 
the old wome n, c hildren...children say Mom, I can't  
carry you any more on my back. I'll throw 
you down. I can't  carry you. You are heavy. The 
mother couldn't walk. Her feet ached. So once th
is woman just let her mother down from  her 
back and left  her there. The...but then she went 
back and picked up her mother whom she had left 
on the ground. Afterwards the girl still couldn't 
walk with her mother on her back. Left her 
behind and the woma n just was left
 to die on the road. Wo me n with 
children in her arms couldn't  
carry them anymore. They were starved. Then 
we rested by a fountain there and I drank some  
water and we  continued walking until there in th
at village...what's the name  of it...I forgot. 
Maybe you could remi nd me .  
 

Q: __________. 

 

A: Yeah. So they took us there so we 
stayed there about two or three months. 

 

Q: Where did you stay? 

 

A: Outside under the sky, on the fields. There wa
s corn left on the fields. We'd go and pick it 
up. We 'd pick up some  grains le
ft on the ground. We would ma ke a 
fire on a tray and we'd cook 
these grains and eat it. And then we just ha
d this older ma n who took us to _______. There there 
were these home s...I guess Russians. I don't know 
who they were. There were gypsies there still 
but they were really housed well. Wh en they took us  in _______ they put us, five, six fa milies in 

one home with the children. A
nyway with everything, and it was on the banks of the ______. 
You could see the water shine at  night. And we 
stayed ther e until it got cooler outside. Well, 
what do we do here?  No food. What
 do we do...just sit here to to tear...to wear down these stone 

walls?  We  just went back to...from where we left. 
Afterwards we stayed there for a while. He got 
sick. Couldn't  stay
 there any longer. 
 

Q: What did he have? 

 

A: Well, you know...hunger. He got weaker. He lost
 weight. He got brown in his face. You 

could look at him and see and anyway I said 
well ma n, rather than dying right under my eyes, 
you know, just leave. If God wants you to escape,
 you will maybe feel sorry for us and you will 
come  and take us out of here. Go home. See ma ybe
 my father heard about us and he'll come  find 
us. We ll, anyway he escaped and left . 

 

Q: What did you do after he left? 

 

A: He left and I was left alone 
with my sister  and the little gi
rl. Yeah. What shall we do? It 
was...how do you call these things 
that you do...I don't know how to ca
ll it. You ma ke rope from 
it and it just used to grow wildl
y...some kind of tall grasses, and we
 went with my sister and we 
picked a lot of these  
tall grasses and we used to ma ke th
e m...braid them, and made ropes from 
them. And we used to go to the Russians, to the 
bazaar and we sold these things. And they'd give 
us a loaf of bread, some  flour, two or three pota
toes when it was warm. Th
en the cold arrived and 
they didn't have any of this stuff either, so 
that's how we lived...from one  day to another.

Not...and we put aside some  things so we could ea
t it gradually, not just in
 one sitting. My father 
heard about us. He came  to pick us up. The first time  he ca me ... 
 

Q: How did he hear about it? 

 

A: My mother wrote to him in _______ and she 
told him about it. He came to pick us up. 

When he came there, he saw us there. He looked us up and when he came he said see, if you 

didn't listen to me , he says. You didn't listen at 
home . You didn't listen to me  here. He came with 
some  food that he got from his army  unit. 

 

Q: Where was his army stationed?  

 

A: At ________. So he came with two knapsacks full of food that they gave him to take us, 

to us. Here...some  cold food and take it to them. 
He came. When he came, he found us there. He 
saw my sister. She was already on he
r death bed almost. She was sick.  
 

Q: What did she have? 

 

A: Typhus. You know, typhus. We , of course, ju
mped on his...in his arms  and kissed him 
and he said just leave me  alone and go and eat. 
But you know there was almost nothing left to eat 
because people had stolen everythi ng by the
n. My father says you are too good. That's why you 

got all the wa y here, because even at home  wh
en I asked you to eat, you wouldn't eat. We ll, there 
was nothing left. Everything had b
een stolen. And my father went
 to the gendarme station post 
there and to tell them who he was and he needed papers to take  us away because he wa sn't  

allowed to co me in there otherwis
e. They did not approve the reque
st to take us away. You go to 
Bucharest and you bring an order from Buchares
t to give you back your family, to take her 
home . He went to Bucharest and nobody gave him any approval. Meanwhile, until he came back 

because it took a long time until he came back from 
Bucharest to there, in the meanwhile...what 
shall I do with her. I didn't  have any me di
cation. She was sleeping on bare ground. We  didn't 
have any sheets, nothing. I would go and collect
 grass from outside and put it on the ground to 
sleep on. So she died.  

 

Q: You are talking about your sister? 

 

A: Yes, yes. My sister died. I was left with 
the little girl. When she died ma ny people died 
and whoever died, they were thro
wn out of this barn-like woods, so you are in a stable, yes, 
without windows, without doors, 
no roof. And whoever was dying they
 just put outside, outside 
the wall. Well, ever y day two, three people ar e 
dying at night again, unt
il there was a bi g hole 

dug outside and they put some  trees in there. They 
set fire to these trees with the people and they 
burnt them up. When he... 

 

Q: Yourfather? 

 

A: Yes. When my father returned from Buchares
t, he went home  first. He knew and told my 
mother I don't know if I 'll bring back both daught
ers. Be happy if I br
ing you one. When my 
mother heard this because...if they had taken my
 mother away and I had left alone, maybe my 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0165

sister would have escaped. My moth
er said here's some  clothes. Take it for the girls to wear. My 
father said don't give clothes for both of them. Ju
s t  give me  clothes for one. My mother realized 
that she was no longer alive, so my father on
ly took stuff for...clothing for me , shoes and 
something for the little girl for 
his sister and he came. He ca me
 in here. Get dressed. Where's 
your sister?  She died. He was so
rry too. He started  crying. He  
said well, ma ybe I could have 
taken her. As ill as she wa s, I would have ma na
ged to save her but they di dn't give me the 
approval. And then we left. We  went to the st
ation. There was a train with soldiers who were 
returning from the front. They put us in a room 
there where they gave us some  tea, bread, but 
who could eat anything when your heart was so
 heavy. I was hungry but 
I just couldn't  eat 
anymore with the little girl after me. The trai n 
arrived and we got on this train. There we re these 

returning soldiers in there. They were wounded, and... 

 

Q: You were there with your father? 

 

A: Yes, yes, yes. He was a soldier. He hadhis weapon with him. He stayed on the stair and 

we stayed inside near these casualties. And even 
if anyone were to would come  to ask us who we 
were, my father would tell them 
that nobody could go into the car because it was filled with sick 
people, so we  went back by _____, by ______, until we arrive d back at ho me  in a station...what's 

the name  of it...Socora.  

 

Q: But your father did not ha
ve the approval to take you? 

 

A: No, no, no. He didn't get it. And we got off at
 Socora. We  arrived there and we got out of 
the train and then he shot twice in the air. It
 was just dawn. My moth

A: There were...let's see...we had two rooms

them to stay there. They were...sorry, I 
can't  understand what you're...anyway, the neighbors 
would come . They were helping my mother. They used to give her food because my mother was 

so restless, was like cr azy. She couldn't just live 
a norma l life until I returned home. She was so 
desperate. Ye s. The neighbors came. When they say me , everyone jumpe d on me . They washed 

me . They dr essed me . They put shoes on my feet
, because I ha d nothing left in the house. The 

house was empty. Everything just wa s gone, and they brought me  cushions, covers, a 

chair...whatever I needed, not that
 I needed a chair but
...and I stayed there. My mother got ill. 
She also became  ill. My father, he wa s...he returned from the front wounded and he di ed. She 

died. And I was left with my 
husband and with my brothers. 
 

Q: In what year did you come  back?

Q: And what happened with the little
 girl, the sister of your husband? 
 
A: Well, she was ill. She had been ill. She c
ouldn't recuperate, poor 
thing. I prepared some  
ointments. I made teas for her. I made some hot
 bath, but nothing helped her, poor thing, so she 
died. She died. The neighbors buried her. How c
ould I do that?  I didn't have any mone y to do 
that. And they buried her. They ma de her casket
 and everything and they
 buried her. And I was 
left...we were left with my mother. And after th

hardships in life. He 
was drafted in the army in '45, and we went 
to _____. During the starvation times we stayed 
there. We stayed a long time there until he was 
dr afted. They drafted him from there. That's 

where he went into the military. And then we we
nt back home, to our home. Only then we kind 
of quieted down a little bit. In '45 we calme d 
down. We  looked for some jobs. We  painted the 
house. We  j ust went back to norma l life. And 
my  mother calmed down a  little bit because she 
saw me . She became sad...every time  I told he r however what happened, you know...camp and 

my brothers...one is still alive. 
The younger one is still alive. The 
older one is dead. He  died in 
'40...'44 or '45. Yeah. And 
about...this is my story.  
 

Q: Thank you. Thank you so much. 

 

A: For nothing. This is the pain
 that we carry and every time  I reme mber I can't stand this, 
because I know how mu ch we suffered and I te
ll my grandchildren and my daughters and my 
grandchildren are dear to me  like the son 
of my e yes...like the apple of my  eyes. 
 

Q: I would like to thank you ag
ain very much, Mrs. Moise. 
We  would like to thank you.  
 

A: I think I realize...you know, 
I'm not a literate person. People didn't go to school at that 
time. We  we re so mi serable. We  wer e  four ch
ildren in the family, and my mother didn't  know 
how to feed us. She couldn't even think about se
nding us to school, and now when I think I don't 
know how ma ny millions of lei(ph) I 
could be pa id just  to forget the pain and the wretched life 
we had. If we tell other people, they don't 
believe you. Nobody believes you and when I tell my 
children, they tell me...Grandma, tell us some other 
stories. I take them near me and I say I'll tell 

you some  st ories and the grandchildren will sa y, ha
...Grandma wants to tell us her stories. Yeah, 

the grandchildren love us, but when I go to their 
house they don't know what to do for us to keep 
us there, because they know I raised th
em up. I he lped them a lot, very mu ch.  
 

Q: I would like to 
thank you again. 

 

A: I think now if my children would see us...t
hey don't know what's  happened to us, they 

would be worried. 

 

Q: OK. I'll call them up. 

 

A: But don't call my son. Ca ll my older daughter. I'll give you her number, because they are 

worried about us. This is it.
