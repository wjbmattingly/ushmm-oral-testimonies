 to do the same  thing. Didn™t go exactly, but I 
tried at least.

to my mother™s sister 
over there, we find out what to
 buy ma terial. So I bought some  ma
terial over there, and I brought 
it back to Poland. As I™m going back to Poland 
-- I bought that time hor
ses, and a ru -- buggy, 
and put some hay, and I put the ma terial undernea
th. And I pass by, the policeman stop me , what 

you got?  I says, nothing. A young boy [indecipherab

follow me  back, stop it, turn around back the hors

they tried to ma ke -- take me

comi ng in. So they told us, let™s make less people, 
because it™s a lot of people come in there, my

ople. So we had people waiting 
outside, my father and my mother tell people,

anyhow, to go in to see what™s going on. So ta 
-- two or three times 
it took [indecipherable]

how for the whole town, everybody should know that 
the guard that caught me  as a blac
k ma rket and they had to put me  in jail. They put me in jail for 
five years. So --

forest and cut trees. And you have to produce so 
much. If you produce so much, then you get so 
much bread. But I was a young boy, I weigh [indeci
pherable] 80 pounds, so skinny like this. And 
everybody, all the big guys over there, they were cu
tting the trees and everything else. And then I 
used to go out to get my dinner. We  used to 
all ha -- bring some thing [indecipherable] soup. As 
I™m getting the soup I seen a guy over there and th

father™s, we deal together. He says, he is -- he
 is in jail already for 10 years this guy. He was 
caught in black ma rket, and he was doing the cooking. He was a cook. Now, to be a cook, you 

make like a millionaire over there. So then every 
day when I come  to find my soup, he gives me  
a little extra soup. And later on at ni
ght he brings me  a piece of bread.

knocked me  out right away, the guy came  and t
ook off the boots, put 
on the boots on himself, 
and says, well, they fit me pretty
 good. And then they give me  some
 rubber to put on my feet -- I

feet. So then another guy came  in and he got 
out -- took a tire and took out -- cut a tire and ma de

I -- that™s what I put 
them on, on my feet, and that™s what
 I used to walk, on the rubber.

14 
 
A: Yes, I was cutting the trees, and I have to
 produce so much, and I never could produce and 
were some  other guys that tried to help me  to put 
on to show that I cut so ma ny trees. They cut it, 
but they show that I cut it, you know? 
Q: Now, wh at was it like in the -- in the barracks?

wet, and you want to dry out the stuff, so some
 days you dried it, some  days you didn™t dry it, 
you just lay down and sleep with the wet feet. 

Q: We re you -- were you afra
id of the other prisoners? 
A: I was afraid of what? 

Q: The other prisoners. 
A: Yes. Wa s only a couple in ther
e to be afraid because
 they were real tough, and they used to -- 
see, we g -- used to get packages from home . 
So they send in the -- they send you some salami , 
some  whatever, some  food, and the other guys used to
 bring the food and hide it for -- I used to 
bring the salami s and everything el
se and give it to the guy, the 
guy [indecipherable]. I said, take 
whatever you wanted, give some thing to me  too.So he was giving more to me  than he took for 
himself. The  other people that 
were hiding, they took away everyt
hing with them, used to beat 
them up, you know. I was okay with that.  

Q: So you had some  protection. 

A: A little, yeah.

A: I would say beginning of the 40™s.  

Q: So, it was in the winter? 

A: Yeah, yeah, it was real cold, and we got in

were praying to God you want to die, the same day you would like to die. And you want to go 

out and you want to do nothing, but then you go, a
nd you walk in and you walk [indecipherable] 
to the police and he said to me , anybody ma ke
s one step behind is gonna be killed, you know?  
So a lot of people do it, they step 10 st
eps and the guy shoot them right away. So 
[indecipherable] you would go on, but you were shaki
ng. [indecipherable] little bit more that I™ll 

tell you later. 

Q: Tell me  more. Y-You mean people were committing suicide that way? 

A: Pardon?

out there, the tree fell down, he 
got killed. So I got excited, the 
only thing [indecipherable] say s
hould happen to me . Didn™t want

A: They [indecipherable] look for some thing that 
he have excess cigarette to ma ke. They steal a 
cigarette from you, if you don™t want to give the 
cigarette, you go into a fight. If you have an 
extra pi ece of bread, you eat, if the other one is hungry he grabs away from you and you don™t let 

him, he beats you up, because he™s the stronger 
one. And I didn™t look for fights [indecipherable] 
Q: And you were getting packages from your -- from home ?  

A: Pa-Packages, yes. 

Q: From home. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Still.

 the -- the one [indeciphera
bl e] I tell him that I 
supposed to get a package, the 
package didn™t come  in, so they
™ll start following up that the 
package was stoled. So they start looking into it,
 he says, if a package come s in you s hould get at 
the time . 
Q: So he was very helpful to you? 

A: Oh well, a lot.

were at camp, a nd they came in, they says anybody, 
Polish citizen could go if they want to do it, if
 you want to get out of

army. So I s a ys, I™ll go to the army. 

Q: What ma de you think -- 

A: I was thinking this -- it wasn™t 
-- it didn™t bother me  if I get ki
lled, doesn™t ma -- matter, to s -- 
sooner it™s better. So I figure I™ll go to the army 
so ma ybe I™ll get killed in the army. So I was in 
the army for a few mont hs, then I got shot over he
re on my back. That took me  out for a little bit 
and then I felt better, they put me  ba ck, put me  ri
ght in the front. So he™s put me  in the front, I 
didn't know how to shoot, nothing. So they give 
me  a truck, should drive a truck, and I didn™t 
know how to drive a truck even. So 
I was driving the truck and then 
I -- right after I got shot, so 
that took me  off on this, and then they teach me  
how to shoot and they put me  right on the front, 
fighting.  

Q: Where were you? 

A: At that time was in Latvia. 

Q: In Latvia? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: So you fought the Ge rmans in Latvia?

mething, you walk into the people and at that 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0519

time yes, I was still a truck driver, so I drive up to
 the farm. They need some  gasoline, so I steal 
all the gasoline from the truck. [indeciphera

 food. [indecipherable] 
Q: You™d never shot anyone before? 
A: And over there, yes. 

Q: But not before this? 

A: No, no.  

Q: So -- so what was it like, shooting -- 

A: The shooting was -- was pretty
 bad, but we were gone. It was 
the [indecipherable] that they

walking one day, and we see an -- a brothe
r recognized each ot her. One was from 
[indecipherable] army, one was in the Russian
 army. And the guy walked up, says, how can you 
fight us? So they start fighting between each othe
r and they killed -- one guy killed the other one. 
Q: The brothers? 
A: Brothers, yeah. And -- well, this
 was going on for -- for a long time.  
Q: Did you ever think about how you could -- how you could get away? 
A: Yes. I was always trying to see how do I get aw
ay to s -- to run away, and we help the other 
people run away, and they got --

So, I was fighting. I ha d one guy, a Ukrainian, a real strong guy in this. He was the one teaching 

me  how to do it [indecipherable] where you go I™
ll go with you, let™s see what we™re gonna do. 
[indecipherable] if we got caught

working for her, and then she got wounded. 
They thought she is killed already. So they pa

are passing by and this is wa -- she™s dead. 
So the guy -- another guy wants to shoot another 
bullet. She put -- a bullet on th
e leg, you know, she was bleeding a 
lot. So the other one says 
[indecipherable] don™t -- don™t use 
the bullets, let™s save the bu
llets, you know, she™s dead. She 
was still alive. They left. At
 night some body pic ked her up andthey took her away about 10 
miles and they picked her up by helicopter and th
ey took her to Moscow. In Moscow -- Stalin 
waited for her and picked her up, I got pictures wher
e Stalin picked her up a
nd they put her in the 
hospital and she survived [indeci

Q: After the war. 

A: After the war.  

Q: How did she know Stalin? 

A: She didn't know Stalin. I says, they brought her 
in, Stalin wants to see

Q: You didn™t know any of this bi --

Q: [indecipherable] 

A: This was told by my sister  later.  

Q: Had you seen any evidence of

you™re doing. And you ca -- dr iving up to the big hill 
over there, and you™re a truck driver, and 
you have to drive it up and the truck cannot go 
up. Wa s not strong enough to go up. So they 
taught us back up the truck backwards, and you go up. So backing up the truck was mu ch 

stronger, and we got up. And we start fighting, wa snot too much fights over there. We walked in 

[indecipherable] we see everybody wa
s trying to be friendly with 
you in Manchuria. So I walked 
in one day and I get -- I need a dentist. I was -- t
oothache. So they take me into the dentist, they 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0519  
24 
 
walk in over there, they all run away because 
they see the Russians are comi ng in. I was there 
with another friend of mi ne. So we walk in [inde
cipherable] they run away. I need some help for 
my tooth, nobody™s there. So I walk in, it™s a 
lot of boxes laying around, big boxes. And I open 
up the boxes, there™s all the things, gold -- gold 
pi eces they put in for the tooth, you know?  So I 
took the boxes, about 10 big boxes wi
th the gold, and put in my car
, and I left, okay?  And then I 
kept it all the time in my  truck. When I was going b
ack to Koretz, I tried to take the gis -- gold as 
much as I can, and this survived me  for anothe
r two or three years, 
selling a piece of gold, buy 
bread, milk, whatever it is. And that™s was a surv
ival til I started doing some thing for myself.  
Q: So you were an entrepreneur from the --

Q: How did you find out about the camps? 

A: How™d I find out?  From papers. People si -- fi
nd a piece of paper, not -- it™s not the paper you 
go to buy every day. Some body else ha
s a piece of paper and he gi
ve to this guy, the other one 
gives to this guy, and you read the 
paper or they talk about it. Or
, like I said, one could have a 
little radio. You get a hundred pe
ople, everybody wants to know what™s going on. It™s no radios 
like over here, I mean, nobody has nothing. 

Q: No iPods? 
A: No. 
Q: No. So you were a part of the Russian 
army in Manchuria. How long did that go on? 
A: Oh, with them probably about a year and a half
. And then I didn™t want to be over there, and 
tried to go away. So then they had the deal that 
said that Polish citizen can just go back to the 
Polish army. If you™re a Polish citizen and you want
 to go -- instead to be in the Russian army, 
you could go to the Polish army. So I says, I™ll 
go to the Polish army. And were quite a few of 
them like this, about 50 people, and they were
 taking us back to go to Poland. There™s a 
lieutenant with us and I talk to him a nd I says, 
I would like to go, before I go to Russia, I would 
like to go to Koretz, to my own town, because my 
sister™s alive, I would 
like to go see my sister. 
Going back and forth was very hard to get a -- to get a paper that you could go there. So he sees 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0519  
26 
 
me wearing an -- a -- a watch. So
 I took out the watch, I gave him the watch. So he gave me  a 
piece of pape r I coul d go see my sister. So I went
 to see my sister to Koretz. As I come  into 
Koretz, was my sister -- they we
re trying to kill my sister over 
there, the Ba nderowcy, the people 
what they are against the Russians. The Ukrainian -- 
Q: Part -- partisans? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Ukrainian party. 

A: So, when [indecipherable] the paper, I says to
 my sister, I don™t want 
you staying here, take a 
look, they just killed another sist
er, another girl that she knew, a
nother guy that he wa s active in -
- with the Russians, and he sa -- 
I don™t want you to stay over 
there, I want you to go with me . 
Let™s run away and we™ll go to Israel. She says, 
I can™t. I got my work ov
er here, in the town, 
everybody knows me  [indecipherable]
 for now, find out that they 
killed some body else that was 
a close friend of mi ne, she got scared. She says
, okay, we™ll go away, we™
ll go to Poland. At that 
time we -- we™re still in Russia, we™re gonna go b
ack to Poland. So she said okay, so she went 

away, and I stayed yet a couple days, and I le
ft, too. And I met her in Germany, actually.  
Q: So the war was essentially over. 

A: Pardon?  

Q: The war was over? 

A: Yeah.  

Q: When you were in the army, did anyone 
ever say anything a
bout your being Jewish? 
A: It was rema rks from certain people what 
you got [indecipherable]. 
Nothing that -- some  
people gonna ma ke fun, that you™re
 afraid of the army, you didn™

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0519  
27 
 
Q: So you didn™t experience any -- th

A: Oh yeah.  
Q: No anti-Semitism?  

A: Yes. Behind the back they s -- they s-say 
something, they make songs, they make fun. I don™t 
know, there always something.  

Q: Did you have good friend in the army?  

A: Yes.  

Q: Non-Jews? 

A: No, Ukrainian. 

Q: Ukrainian? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: But non-Jewish Ukrainians? 

A: No. No, I had a non-Jewish friend too, yeah, on

real, real close with me , he wa
s re -- older. He had -- he ha
d the respect and he was always 
talking we gonna get together afte
r -- after the army. As -- being with him in the army and we 
would -- he was a truck driver, 
too, backing up we used to hide
 the trucks under the trees at 
night. And backing up the truck, and he wants to
 be before everybody else. I was going -- what, 
we were kidding with each other. I want to ba
ck up the truck, he backs out the truck, he got 
explosion and he got killed
 right there, with the 
truck and everything else.

Q: Is it -- what was the fi rst thing that
 came to your mi nd whe n the war was over? 
A: How do I settle, where do I settle, what 
I do?  But a young kid didn™t care what it is. 

Q: So did you think you™re going to m
ove back -- go back to Koretz? 
A: In beginning I would say yes. And then wh
en I see what happened over there, not too ma ny 

left , that  people this --  well, they came back fr om the army like I said before, this one was 

without a leg, without a arm, 
without a ear. Everybody had some thing, you know?  So what I™m 
gonna see in Koretz?  Nothing th
ere. And the people, where they left, ma ybe a hundred Jews 
came back, ma ybe. Survived.

So if I see some thing I keep shooting.  
Q: So what was it like to be a -- to be a soldie

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0519

everything was done, when she had to run away, she 
wants to go to Israel, she wants to fight over 
there. And that was [indecipherable] that I shoul
d go there, too. And I was going to go to Israel. I 
had a uncle and -- in Detroit that
 I never me t, I didn™t know, it™s 
my mother™s brother. He was 
single and he had six sisters. 
And [indecipherable] kept everybody going. He was a businessman, 
and he want us to come  over there, so he used to
 write me  letters, I want you to come . And every 

letter he used to send me  five dollars. Five dol
lars was a lot of money. 
So I™m waiting for a letter 
all the time . And he talked me  into go, so my si
ster, she said she would lik
e to go to Israel. So I 
said, okay, you go to Israel, and I™ll come  later.
 I was in the trucking bus
iness, working for the 
UNRRA and so I [indecipherable] to 
about five trucks and I send her 
to Israel. So I figure when I 
come  in over there, they told me  it™s a real
 good business. So five GMC trucks and I bought a 
Mercedes car, and a Dodge car and I send everyt
hing over there. They came in over there, my 
sister coul dn™t take them out because they need 
a lot of duty. I didn™t know 
I have to pay some of 
the duty. She didn™t have the money. I usedup all the money to send it over there. 
Q: Where did you get the 
money to buy the cars? 
A: Over there? In Ge
rmany? In German -- 
Q: So you™re in Germany at this point? 
A: At that time  in Ger many, yeah. 

Q: Where did you get the money?  

A: Ah, back in black ma rket. 

Q: Okay. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: When did you leave Koretz to go to 
Germany?  You left Koretz and went -- 
A: When I left K-Koretz, that
 was 1945, to go to Germany. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0519  
36 
 
Q: Right after the war. Wh
ere did you go in Germany?  
A: Near Stuttgart, called the Sw
asa Halfingen. That™s was a zeiling 
over there, was a little camp 
for t he DPs. 
Q: DP ca mp . 

A: Yeah, and we were staying over there. 

Q: And you had me t your wife? 

A: My wife I me t when I came back to Koretz. Sh
e was there, but that wa
s just only a few days, 
and she was the only one girl left
 [indecipherable] from all the Jewish people. She survived. I 
knew her parents, because my fa
ther used to deal with them. And we start talking now 
[indecipherable] going back to Germany, I said I™
m going to Germany, I have to run -- because -- 
because of my sister, I want to ma ke sure we
 run away. So a few days later she came  to 
Germany, to the same  town I was at, and we got 
ma rried four days later. Got a big wedding. We  

had four people. 
Q: Four people. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Who wer e  they? 

A: Huh?  

Q: Who wer e  they? 

A: Huh?  

Q: Who wer e  the four people? 

A: Ah, I was there. And the guy had a house, he le
t us stay over there with his wife and her 
brother. And [indecipherable] we brought
 in a rabbi and we had the wedding.  
Q: How did you find a rabbi? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0519  
37 
 
A: There was a lot of them comi ng around [indeci
pherable] was it a real 
rabbi or not, I™m not 
sure yet. But [indecipherable] paper. 
Q: So that was 1945 you got ma rried? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: And you -- 

A: Actually ™46. 

Q: ™46. 

A: ™44 -- ™45. [indecipherable] 

Q: And then you engaged in black ma rketeering -- 

A: Say exactly, I didn't hear you. 

Q: You -- you -- you were involv
ed in black ma rketeering. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: So what happened when the plan fell through to go to Israel -- 
to go to Palestine? 
A: What [indecipherable] but my 
sister told me  that it™s a goo
d thing you didn™t come over here, 
because then I have pay a lot of money take out 
the trucks. And it™s hard to make a living there, 
in Israel right now. And my uncle 
wrote the letter to come  over 
here. I didn™t know what he is 
doing. He brought me  into his house, you know, the bi
g f -- big house, took me  in and my wife, 
and at that time I ca me , I had my son with me . 
We stayed with them. It didn™t work out too good, 
because he, my uncle, is -- his ni ece was a single 
girl. When they brought me in over here, they 
always had in the mi nd I™m going to come  in, ma rry
 that girl. When I brought my wife, wasn™t so 
-- they weren™t too happy. So when I find out what 
it is, I decided to move to go some place else. 
So a friend of mi ne was  from my own town, 
and he knew that I™m not getting along, but no 
fights, just I know that it™s not
 a good feeling there. So he said, move into my house. He has a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0519  
38 
 
one bedroom house, and I moved in in the living 
room, we had a bed on the floor and we stayed 
together for a little bit. Then I 
got in -- I me t a guy that is look
ing for a job, so I find out the guy 
has a [indecipherable], and his wife was my older si
ster™s best girlfriend in
 Koretz. So when he 
finds I™m over here, so he can start talk to me , 
what do you want to do in 
America?  I says, I will 
do anything, I just want a job. So
 he took me  out one day, he drove
 around with me . He said, I™m 
building here and I™m building -- it was a big buil
ding. And then we pass by a lumber yard that 
says a -- a few Jewish people working over ther
e, I -- I couldn™t speak
 nothing in English, you 
know. He said, ma ybe you want to work over here, 
I says good. So, next morning I went to work 
over there. And I worked there for a few months, 
and before [indecipherable] he came  into me  
one day, he says, everybody likes you over here. I 
want you to be the buyer to buy the lumber. I 
said, buy the lumber for what?  I don™t know how
 to talk. How do you gonna buy it?  He  said, 
well, I™ll hire, I got a girl over here, a Polish gi
rl, and she™ll work with
 you together. You do the 
buying. I says, you™re ma king fun of me . He said no. 
So, before I turn around they ma de me  the 
fore ma n, then I started doing the buying in the lumber yard. 
Q: What did you speak?  What language? 

A: Mostly Jewish, and Polish. 

Q: But you -- so you knew Polish? 

A: Yes. 

Q: But -- but not English or German? 

A: No, not enough English, nothing. So, we wo
rked there for awhile, and came back 

Christma stime, and I couldn™t go, 
I couldn™t drive, I didn™t have
 no license or nothing. So a guy 
used to pick me  up all the time, take me  back 
to work. And this was about 20 miles. But the guy 
was nice to doing it, because [indecipherable] th
e boss in there. But by about two years I was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0519  
39 
 
working over there, and everybody find out with 
me  I™ m a good worker. And they don™t pay me  
too much. As [indecipherable] pay me 50 dollars a 
week, seven days a week, and I didn™t care, I 
ma ke ma ybe  [indecipherable] some
body else [indecipherable] 75 dolla
rs a week. So I go back to 
him, I tell, Harry, I says 75 dollars. He says, 
Do-Don™t worry about, I™ll 
give you 75. And then I 
want -- had -- need a car, so I got -- I got [indeci
pherable] license, I bought an old car, and I have 
to pay for the car, it™s 800 dolla
rs. I haven™t got no money. So they say, we ™re gonna loan you the 
money, and we™ll take off 20 dollars a week fo
r your salaries. Okay. So it goes by a week, two, 
three, they™re not taking out the money. So I go back
 to him, I says, wait a mi nute, I can™t afford 
it, you didn™t take out the mone
y. [indecipherable] the money, you
™re supposed to take it from 
the -- my salary. Said, no, no, no, you cannot do it. He says, you have to pay right now for the 
four weeks. Well, okay, I have to, I have to, ta
ke it all, the whole thing, you know. And then 
[indecipherable] he said no, don™t 
worry about it, the car is a 
present for you. You know, that 
ma de -- ma de a -- a big deal, yeah. And [indecipherable] open up the lumber yard 
[indecipherable] the two partners
. They fight -- fighting between 
them and he come to me and 
says to me , you know what?  We  closing up the pl
ace. I want you to go into business. You take 
over the place. I says, I™m gonna take over the pl
ace?  I ain™t got no mone y. Then he says, well, 
we™ll work it out some how. So, he went, he br
ought me  another guy, he says, that guy™s gonna 
go in partners with you. So another guy come s in 
the partners and start talking to me . He say, 
we™re gonna go into business, does he have a
ny money. I says no, do you have any money?  He 
says no. So what are we going?  Says well, the 
people what you deal with them with buying, go 
into Mr. Martin, tell him that 
you want to go into business. So
 I go and tell the guys they™re 
gonna go in business. He says okay -- I-I -- I 
was buying for them. He says, show me  your 

statement. I said, what™s a statement? I didn™
t know nothing [indecipherable]. So I stayed with 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0519  
40 
 
them for awhile, then I stay with a partner, and go
ing to the -- to the bank
er that didn™t know me  
from somebody -- from the other people. I said th
e same  thing, I want to go into business, but I 
need money. Said the same  thing, give me  a 
statement. So, I don™t know what you™re talking 
about. Make the story short, the guy gave me  
3,000 dollars credit, [indecipherable] give me  
3,000 dollars credit. And we got [indecipherable]
 in the business, had good customers, the 
[indecipherable] was a big builder and he paid me
 every week. So I got in business and that™s -- 
I™m still in the same business. 
Q: I need to change the tapes real quick.

Beginning Ta pe Three 
Q: Be-Before you tell me more about -- about 
Germany, let me ask you a different kind of 
question. Di -- do you reme mber when you hear
d that your parents had been killed? 
A: Yes. 
Q: And you were with your -- wi
th your sister at the time ?  
A: Yes.  

Q: And wha t  were your 
reactions to th -- 

A: I [indecipherable], but what can you d -- th-t
hey were dead. So they not the only one, but you 
know, this, the other one, every day a different stor
y. This one got killed, th
e other one got killed.  
Q: So gradually you heard 
about the whole fa mily. 
A: Oh yeah, slow but sure, I think I got to know about everybody.  

Q: Did you ever think about re
ligion, God, in all of this -- 
A: All the time. 
Q: What did you think? 
A: But what -- what I think? 

Q: About God. 

A: Wa s only one God and is -- God is good for everybody. You have to believe in it.  

Q: But did you think why -- why God is allowing this to happen? 

A: Yes. But there™s still a God, and you have to be
lieve in it, and we hope for the best, and it™s 
gonna happen, some day, is gonna happen good, like wh
en you™re alive. If you™re not alive, you 
cannot do.  

Q: So you just thought, there™s a mys t ery here and it™s some thing you can™t explain. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0519  
42 
 
A: No. That very hard to explain. And some ti
me s when you ask the question it doesn™t come  out. 
But when you walk away and you drive the car, or
 you talk with other people about some thing, 
e-everything opens up. 

Q: Like what?  Tell me . 

A: The s -- the same  thing which it has before, an
d the things what happen, it™s comi ng out, it™s 
come -- it comes in the mi ddle of the night, sometimes in the daytime, someti mes you got upset 

with certain things. Then you st
art thinking and say, what are you 
getting upset about it?  Take a 
look. Thank God you™re over here. Y
eah. But I™m still getting upset.  
Q: So it™s -- part of you is sti
ll back there, is that right? 

A: P-Pardon? 

Q: Part of you is still back -- 

A: Back? 

Q: -- back in Europe. 
A: Oh yeah. Oh yeah. I™m going right now back to Koretz. 
Q: Real -- is this the fi rst time? 

A: Yes. Wh y I™m going, I don™t know. The reason 
I™m going there actually, because my son is on 
my back, he wants to see where I was born. So he 
wants me  to go over there, he wants to see the 
place. And no Jewish people left there, nobody th
ere. There™s the cemetery. And we build the 
cemetery. I gave a lot of money to do -- to ma ke the cemetery there. And he was born in 

Germany, a nd he wants to go to the same  place wh
ere he was born, to see it. So that™s -- we 
decided we gonna go in Septem
ber to go to that places. 
Q: Now, he was born in the DP camp? 

A: Yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0519  
43 
 
Q: Are you -- are you an
xious about going back? 
A: Am I wh at? 
Q: Are you anxious?  Is -- are you nervous about going back? 

A: No. No. I was before, then I stopped. And th
en, when you start talking to me , now I start 
thinking, well ma ybe to go, let him s ee, and then see 
for the rest of my gr andchildren, have to -- 
to know what was going on. 

Q: He knows your story? 

A: My son, yes. 

Q: And your grandchildren? 

A: Does he have any? 

Q: Your grandchildren, 
do they know as well? 
A: Yes, yes, and they are very much in
terested all the time to ask questions.  
Q: You think it™s important to 
talk -- to talk about it? 
A: The way they asking me , I think it™s very important. 
Q: Why?  

A: Because if they want to know, they should know what was going on and not to believe in 

everything, and be alert 
[indecipherable] to know. That™s my feeling.  
Q: What do you think about all the attention th
e -- the Holocaust and th -- and Holocaust 
survivors have been getting -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- since the museum opened?
 ﬁSchindler™s List,ﬂ -- 
A: Should they what? 

Q: ﬁSchindler™s Listﬂ. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0519  
44 
 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Lots of different movies. 

A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: Academy awards. 

A: Uh-huh. 

Q: What do you think about all that? 

A: We ll, it™s there, and everybody knows about
 it, and it™s a true story, everything. 

Q: So it™s a good thing. 

A: It™s a what? 

Q: Have you been to the museum? 

A: Which one? 

Q: In Wa shi ngton. 

A: Yes, quite a few time s .  
Q: You son is very active in it. 
A: My son is very active in there, and is -- ever
y time we goes, he ma kes sure we go over there. 
[indecipherable] went there just a couple months 
ago. It was a big shindig at the time, with the 
candle lightening over there, so I was the one
 [indecipherable] candl
es [indecipherable] 
Q: For the me m -- me morial service?  

A: Yeah. 

Q: A-And -- was in April. 

A: Yeah, in April [indecipherable]. 

Q: Does it bother you to talk about it? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0519  
45 
 
A: Depends what day. Some times yes, some ti me s -- some times -- some  place [indecipherable] 
ask a question, don™t ask for nothing. And some times
 they ask one little question, I could go for 
two hours and talk.  

Q: How do you -- how do you explain that? 

A: That™s -- it™s all very hard 
to explain, like I just said. I sa
y nothing but the truth. Some  day you 
want to talk, some day you don™t want to talk nothing. That™s all. 

Q: Have you spoken in schools or anything like that? 

A: [indecipherable] 

Q: Have you spoken in schools? 

A: [indecipherable] 

Q: Yeah. 

A: No, no. 

Q: Have you done interviews before?  A
ny interviews like 
this one before? 
A: No.  

Q: This is the fi rst time? 

A: Yeah, I never wanted to do it. 

Q: Why?  

A: We ll, my  sister done it in -- 
in Israel, and she wanted me  to do it at that time. And then I say 

yes, and [indecipherable] they call me  to go on to
 do it, I said, no, I don™t want it. I was too busy, 
and I don™t want no -- things to come  back to 
my mi nd, and I should thi
nk about it all the time. 
And so I forgot about it, forget it. The same  lik
e I says to my son, I don™t want to go. If I go over 
there and I™m not seeing nothing 
[indecipherable] my house is st
ill there, but I don™t se -- no 
friends, nothing. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0519  
46 
 
Q: Mm. 
A: I have a fe w Ukrainian friends who they were 
real close friends, they we re 10 - 15 miles away 
from us. And we are find out that they™re not alive.
 And [indecipherable] even I -- if I go to Israel 
-- I used to go there oftener, the last 10 years 
I wasn™t there. Every time  I call up and I ask for 
some body, t hey say, oh he is dead six months a
go. Oh, he is dead two years ago, you know?  So 

90 percent of my f-friends, they™re not 
there. I don™t want to go there. 
Q: You said you -- you didn't want to 
think about it agai
n, bring it all up. 
A: Yeah -- no, no, not think at all. 

Q: [indecipherable] 

A: [indecipherable] what we doing today, I suppose
d to go to Washington, and my son is on my 
back before we go, I want to see everything, to 
bring it up, whatever you f
eel like doing, talk. If 
you don™t want to talk, don™t talk. 

Q: Isn™t it always with you anyway
?  Isn™t it always there with you? 
A: Who?  

Q: Your experience. Don™t you always -- 

A: Oh yeah, the experience is there. 

Q: -- think about it at some  level?
 What is that like?  I mean, to
 -- to occasionally s-suddenly stop 
and have some thing come  back from -- 

A: I don™t know. Maybe next day I™ll tell you so, 
right now I cannot tell you yet. For sure, it™s 
going to be a lot of [indecipherable]
 things to talk [indecipherable] 
things were to ask me , things 
what I™m talking about. 
It™s [indecipherable] 
Q: Is there anything you want to conclude wit
h, you want to s -- anyt
hing you want to say to 
your children or grandchildren on the tape? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0519  
47 
 
A: That -- if I want to say to them? 
Q: That you want to conclude with. 

A: Oh, it -- I always do, when they ask me  
with some thing. They were never too much 
interested, but the fe w time s when I told one 
grandson and he asked me , he was very enthu -- 
he™s working for me  for the summer. And I take 
him out to lunch once in awhile [indecipherable] 
Grandpa, so how did you survive?  What did you do, 
how did you do?  Just start talking to him. 
Then you talk to the other one, the other one came 
to me , he says, well, you talked to David, and 
you never tell me , I™d like to find out, too, from y
ou. I said, I cannot tell you today, I™m not in a 
good mood. And I didn™t tell him that day, and he
 goes back to the mother, says, I asked 

Grandpa, and he wouldn™t say nothing to me . 
So t hey pass by another month or two, and it 
happened we talking about some thing, and I sa
y, okay Michael, you asked me  about some thing 
before, and I could tell you right now. Nobody™s here
, it™s a quiet pl ace. And I start talking to 
him. But he asked me  to tell him that day, no. 
Now the same  thing was -- today [indecipherable]. 
15 years ago my sister begged me  to do it, I 
said well, ma ybe I™ll do it some day. And some body 
asked me  to do it, the rabbi. I says, I-I™ll do it, 
I™ll do it, don™t worry about 
it, never done. I didn™t 
want to bring it up even.  

Q: What brought you to Detroit? 

A: Who?  

Q: What brought you to Detroit? 

A: I just me -- my -- had an uncle over here, and 
he wants me  to come  here, to Detroit. I never 

knew nothing about Detroit, and I didn™t care
. He™s the one who brought me, so I™m here.  
Q: So wa -- was it e-either Detroit or Palestine, is that what it w -- 

A: Yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0519  
48 
 
Q: And you decided on Detroit? 
A: Detroit, because my sister said to me, let™
s you stay there and I™ll stay over here. You™ll come 

visit me , I™ll come  visit you, and that™s what we
™re doing. So she got ma rried over there, she was 
doing pretty good, and her husband got sick and died. Then she was sick for a long time , and she 

died. My younger sister. 

Q: Your younger sister. If you had to think of one
 mo- moment  in your Holocaust experience that 
stands out more than anything else -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- what would that mo me nt be? 

A: What would that -- 

Q: What would that mo me nt be?  Wh
at would that event be
?  Just wa -- just one 
that stands out in 
your mi nd more vividly 
than anything else. 
A: The -- the Holocaust? 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Yes. We ll, it™s always -- the Holocaust alwa
ys on your mi nd some thing. It™s always some  -- 
come s with some  -- you remi nd yourse
lf little things and 
big things, it -- it come s to your mi nd 
and it™s -- a -- a -- a prif 
-- pretty bad story some time. 
Q: So they all blend together? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: They all come  together? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: So no -- no one -- one mo ment that sta
nds out more than any of the others? 
A: Oh yes, a lot more. A lot more.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0519
