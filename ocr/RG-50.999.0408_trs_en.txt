George with his non

Jewish neighbors in 1943.  
 
 
Af ter Hungary allied itself with Nazi Germ any, Istvan and Margit losttheir jobsdue to new laws 
restricting the participation of Jews in the new econom y.  Istvan wasconscripted to labor battalions, 
andthef am ily was forced to move intobuildings m arked with the yellow star,
 
like this seen in the 
photograph.  T hat f all, the fam ily went into hiding.  T he Pick fam ily was discovered, the children taken 

andGeorge placed ina hom e with 500otherchildren. George andanother boy escaped and went 
back to their hiding playing where
 
George wa s reunited with his parents.T wo weeks later, theentire 
fam ily was sent tothe ghetto.T hey were liberatedby the Soviets inJanuary 1945. 
 
In this1946photograph we see George with a group of survivors, al l of  with whom  the 
P ic k  f am ily h a d  
been in hiding. And the circle is, of course, on George.  
 

 
Following the war, George lived in Hungary where he earned adegree inengineering untillate 
1956, when he escaped andm ade his way to the United States to live with his uncle in New
 
Je rse y.   
Af
ter working as a laborer, George got a scholarshipf oran intensiveEnglish language course at 
T em ple University in Philadelphia.  He then went to work forW estinghouse asanengineer. George 

would later teachengineering atthe Catholic Universit y of America, here in Washington, DC.  Af ter 
earning his Ph.D. he worked for the US Navy as an aerospace engineerf rom 1966

Glad to have you here.  
 
 
W e've got a lot to cover.  W e'll start.  You were nearly 4
 
1/2,George, when Germany invaded 
Poland in Septem ber1939.  Let's startf irst wit h you telling us what your life was like, what your 

comm unity was like in those years leading up to thebeginning of W orldW ar II with the invasionof  
Poland in Septem ber1939.  
 
>> Ge o rge  P ick:  I like to f irst sta rt with m y fam
ily.  My f am ily hadbeen in Hungary, and I had 
docum entsfor this,for230 years prior to theearly 20th century.  Most of my fam ily m em bers were 
either prof essional, such as jewelists, lawyer s, engineers, doctors,andnot afew of them were 
businessm en as
 
we ll.   
 
 
My grandparents'f am ilies were ver y lar ge.  All of  m y grandparents had 8 or 9 siblings, of  
course. That made the fam ily larger even in the second, third generation.
 
T hey li ved in all parts of 
Budapest, butm y im mediate fam ily m oved to Budapest in the latterthird of the century.  That's where 

I was born.  
 
As you mentioned in the introduction,m y f ather was an engineer.  He worked until1935, 
1936, when we had, as m ost of partof  the world, the Great Depression, and he lost his job.  He was 
doing occasional work until 1938, whenm y gr andfather got him  an engineering job.  My grandfather 
was the chief engineer in a very large f actory, and he worked that. And that ended on January 1, 
1939.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Before we go there, George,your m other also worked. Tell us a little bit about why 

she worked.

>> G
eorge Pick: W ell, af terthef irst world wa r ended, theAustro
-
Hungarian em pirefell apart, and 
particularly Hungary lost 2/3 of  its area and 1/2 of  its population.T here was alwa ys an underlyin g 
anti
-
sem itism  in Hungary.  Becauseof  that, and because of the resentmentof  losing the war, 
Hungary was thef irst country in Europetoenact an anti
-
Jewish law,  which was called theNum erus 
Clausus. This was enacted in 1920
-
21.  
 
>> Bill Benson: W ellbefore Hitler's rise to power.  
 
>> George Pick: W ellbef ore
 
Mussolini and Hitler, correct. Becauseof  that,the Numerus Clausus 
was m ostly because of the overrepresentation of  Jewish students in universities, the Jews were 

roughly 5% of the population, and 50%of  the university students were Jewish.  So what they
 
d id  is  
they said toom any Jews and they kicked them  out. One of them  was m y uncle, Charles,Hungarian.  

He was beaten up.  Not just kicked out,butphysicall y assaulted, kicked out,amongm any thousands 
of  s t ud en t s .   
 
 
So he anda number of hisfriends essentially left Hungary, and he personally went to Italy to 
start all over again.  He was a third
-
year studentat thatpoint.  It took him 8 years to get am edical 
degree and graduate the university.  
 
 
My m otherf inished com mercial school, andat age16,17 shehad to go to work becauseboth 
of  her olderand younger brothers had to be given m oney to continue their studies. Her younger 

brother was in Berlin, studied to be anoptom etrist.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Really, shehad to work in order to supporther brothers continuing their educations 

elsewhere?

>> George Pick: T hatis correct.  My grandfather, althoughhe was a chief engineer,his money was 
not that much.W e lived in a very
 
--
 
or they li ved,actually, in a very s m all apartm ent andhad enough 
to eat
 
andeverything else, but not enoughtosupport the two children.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  In light of theanti
-
Sem itic laws passed in Hungary, you toldm e yourf am ily was ver y 
assim ilated. Say a little bitm ore about that.  
 
>> G e o rge  P ick:   My f am ily wa s a ssi
m ilated, to the best of m y knowledge, ever sincethe 19th 
century. T hey lived in sm aller towns, andas I m entionedthey had chosen professions such as 

m edical, engineering and sof orth, and therewere a numberof m ixed marriages.  
 
 
T hey did not say that they were not Jewish, but they didn'temphasize it either. And so it was 
som ewhatof a very bad surprise to them  when in 1938 the Hungarian Congress hadenacted thef irst 
anti
-
Jewish law.  I woul d say this Num erus Clausus law sort of  wasn't enforcedaf ter
 
1928.  Between 
1928 and 1938, that decade. T here were no Jewish laws enf orced.  
 

>> Bill Benson: T heywere still on thebooks?  
 
>> George Pick:  On the books,butnot enforced. Then in 1938, they had the next one, thefirst 

Jewish la w, which essentially haddeprived about 20%, 25% of theJews of  their existence. T hat is 
when m y father,f orexam ple, lost his job, and m any others. 
 
 
T hey thoughtthat thiswas going to be the one and only law.  T hey were very disappointed, 
because lessthan a year later, there was another law, which was essentially, again, evenmore 
proscribing, m ore
 
--
 
putting m ore problem s on Jewish lif e,m ostly, again, duetoeconom ic conditions.  
 
>> Bill Benson: T hatwould have been late1939?  
 
>> George Pick:  It would be late 1939.

>> Bill Benson:  So that's really ri ght af terW orldW ar II has begun,with the invasion of Poland.  Even 
thoughthef ull bruntof the war would not come to Hungary until 1944, 4
 
1/2 years later, youf elt its 
eff e cts a lmo st im me d iate ly.  I th in kth at'
s exactly what you're beginning to tellus.  
 
 
T ell us what life was likefor yourf am ily in theearly years of  the war.  
 
>> George Pick:  OK. I just want to say thatwith the second Jewis h law there was a secret part to it, 

which was not publicized, which was thatpeople who were notanti
-
comm unist and pro
-
Nazis were 
essentially declared people who were not tobe trusted. And these were the socialists, comm unist 

party was legal at thattim e,and the Jews.  And these people wereordered to serve the coun
t r y a s  
laborers, slave laborers, f orced laborers.  Sothe Jews, and the Jewi sh manparticularly, we re in this 
category.  
 
 
Now, your question ishow did m yf am ily li ve. W ell, when m yf atherlost his job, there wasa 
system  in Hungary whi ch was relativel y typica l of  Hungarians. W hatthey did is they hired the 

non
-
Jewish m en, they called them  the straw m en, or strohm enn inGerm an, those non
-
Jewish m en 
got the licenseto run a business, business license.  In our case, it was a super, Mr.
 
Dudek, a very 
nice man, and he tooka license out, andm y father worked under that license.  Nom inally, he was his 
em ployee, m yf ather was his em ployee, but in reality, of course,m y father bid him .W hichm any 
thousands of peopledid this. 
 
 
My f atherhad connections, just like everybody else, and as theeconom y started to spin upf or 
the war, we were not in war as you said, these businesses werefairly prosperous,actually.   
 
 
I like toadd onem orething, which is im portant. T he only person inthe family who saw wh at 
wa s  
com ing was m y uncle, who camef rom Padua, who has seen the world in Europe.

>> Bill Benson: T he one who studiedmedicine? 
 
>> George Pick: T heone who studiedm edicine.  He saw fascism  in Italy, of  course,and he saw 
what was going to happen.  He was the only one who left Hungary legally, actually.  He married an 
Am erican citizen in 1938. Becausehe knew things were going to be bad.  
 
 
W e, in Hungary, did not think. W e did not know ver y m uch about what was going on in 
Germ any, exceptf or thefact that we heard Hitler yelling and scream ing into them icrophone.  
Fortunately, I didn't understand it,but m yf ather and mother did.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  You rem em ber hearing it, right?  
 
>> George Pick:  I remem ber hearing it and being f rightened by justthe sound of his voice. AndI 
askedthem  whathe was saying, andthey said "W ell, you cannot take apolitician too seriously.  But it 
wi ll never happen to us, because Hungary is Hungary here. T hey are Hungarians andthe 
governm ent will never allow it."   
 
 
It t
urns out that the governmentof  Hungary was 
--
 
by def ault, I would say, became an ally of  
Hitler.  I say " by default"  because Hungary and Hungarianpoliticians were trying to get back piecesof  

Hungary in the inter
-
war period.  
 
>> Bill Benson: W hat they'd lost in thef irst war?  
 
>> George Pick:  Correct, what they'd lost inthef irst war, but nobody was listening to them. T he only 
m an listening,actually two, Mussolini and Hitler.  So by default,the region was essentially hadtoally 
h im s e lf  wit h  Hit le
r with thehopes of getting pieces back.  
 
 
In 1939, 1940, 1941, Hungary got back the southern Hungarianpart, which was Yugoslavia 
prior, northern part, which was Slovakia, andalsoT ransylvania, northern T ransylvania. T his was 

 
ROUGH DRAFT  T RANSCRIPT
 
NOT A V ERBATIM RECORD
 
10
 
im portant for m y f am ily, a
lso,because m yf am ily m embers were also dom iciled in theseareas.  
 
 
So all of a sudden, m yfam ily was in one country again, f or20 yearsor so we were in three 
different countries. My father was called upfor one of these work cam ps
 
--
  
>> Bill Benson: 
 
But itwas slave labor?  
 
>> George Pick:  Slave labor. T hey didn't get any m oney, and they hadto work ver y hard. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Slave labor, yes.  
 
>> George Pick:  Slave labor, yes. T hef irst tim e he went to what isnow Ukraine, which wa s carved 

outof  Russia, carved out of Russia,and he was working on a road building project. 
 
 
I im aginepeople whoare in their late 30s, earl y 40s, out of shape and they get a piece of 
heavy m etal,piecetobreak up big stones into small stones. It was not very
 
pleasant.  
 
 
T hef ortunatething was that the unit comm ander and thepeople who were in charge of this 
brigade were rather decentpeople
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  Of his particular brigade.  
 
>>
 
George Pick:  Of his particular brigade.  Ratherdecentpeople.So they did not work people to 
death,essentially.  T his went onfor threem onths,and thenm y father came home.  
 
 
But then, in1941 
--
 
this was 1940.  1941, about six m onths later, Juneof
 
1941, when the 
Germ ans startedto invade Soviet Union, Hungar y also became a region, and with that Hungar y sped 

up its industry and put togetheranarm y for Hitler, athis urging, 150,000people, very poorly clothed 
andpoorly equipped, actually.  Plus 50,000 Jewish slave laborers.  
 
 
In about April or May of 1942,these people were sent to the Ukraine.  Am ong them  were 
several of m y relatives, several of m y uncles and cousins andpeople who were younger than 40 

 
ROUGH DRAFT  T RANSCRIPT
 
NOT A V ERBATIM RECORD
 
11
 
years old.  My f ather was 41, sohe was lucky he was older.  Like I said, Ihad several of them .  
 
 
Of this group of people, they had a very, ver y tough tim e,I would say. That's an 
understatem ent.  Essentially, 90% of them died. In the winter of 1942
-
43.  Many of thesepeople who 
went there were not equippedf or it.  Minus
-
40
-
degree weather, number one, so m any of  them  froze 
to death,m any of them were starved to death, and many of  them  were beaten to death.  
 
 
Many of the people, non
-
Jewish leaders, were given orders thatuntilthe last Jew is alive they 
couldnot come back. So they hada very go od reasontoessentially get rid of  all of  the Jews they 
could.  
 
 
As a result, plus that the Russian arm y had ahuge overwhelm ing vic tory in January of  1943, 
where the Hungarian arm y was at the Danube, large river in Ukraine.  They broke through thatf ront in 

f ive days.  Five days they wiped out the Hungarian arm y.  Many of  them died.  Some becam ePOW s.  
Andalso the rest of the work of the slave laborers.  And of the 50,000, only about 5,000, 6,000 cam e 
home. I was lucky, I had a couple of uncles who survived, several who did not.  
 
>> Bill Benson: T hatwas 1942? 
 
>> George Pick:  1942
-
43.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  In that same tim e, in 1942, isn't that when Hitler began to press Hungary to start 

deporting Jew
s?   
 
>> George Pick: T hatis correct, yes.  If anybody is fam iliar with thehistory of the Holocaust, Hitler's 

f inal solution was infull
-
blown andfull m ovement by 1942. T he death cam ps were running.  1
 
1/ 2  
m illion Ukrainian and Russian Jews were dead already.  Ukrainian, Polish, etc.  Hungary had 

825,000
-
m em ber Jewish com munity, which at that point was the largest Jewish com munity in Europe.  
 

 
ROUGH DRAFT  T RANSCRIPT

12
 
 
So Hitler triedtopress, or pressure, Horthy tostart the deportation.  Horthy said, No, we'renot 
going to d
o  i t.
 
Hitler was not in the position at that pointtodo any more than beupset, so we 
were saved at that point.  
 
 
T hat lastedanother year and som e, and by March 19, it was 78 years ago
 
--
 
no,79 years ago 
yesterday.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Yesterday.  
 
>> G e
orge Pick: T heGerm ans no longer trusted the Hungarians,they knew the Hungarians had 
various connections, back
-
door connectionswith both the English and Soviets, and they were trying 
to get outof  the war som ehow, andthe German intelligence penetrated the Hungarian intelligence, so 
they knew Hitler was worried abouta couple of m illion German soldiers who were eastof  Hungary.  
So what they did, they just cam e in.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Before we go there, George,com e back a little bit, still back to 1943.
  
You told me 
that was when you, asa child, youexperienced your f irst real senseof  the danger and threat.  You 
hadn'tf elt it asmuch up until that point.W hat happened in 1943, I think you were on an outing with 
your m other, I believe.  
 
>> George Pick:  Right.  I was relatively insul ated until then. I wentto a Jewish elementary school, 

and we didnot have
 
--
 
we had anti
-
Sem itic neighbors, but they were not so anti
-
Sem itic as if they 
would spit in ourf ace or som ething.  But in 1943, interestingly enough, my f ather was again called in, 

andthen after he came back, after threem onthsof  slave labor, we went to a place, which was a 
rather nice hotel inthem ountains of Hungarian,f ora vacation.  
 
 
My m other and I were walkin g, and thism ountain wasf ull off orests,walkin g through the 

 
ROUGH DRAFT  T RANSCRIPT
 
NOT A V ERBATIM RECORD
 
13
 
forests,and that was the f irst contact with the extrem e Nazis. T heycalled them  the Arrow Cross 
Na zis .   
 
 
T he Arrow Cross at that point were illegal, but they had gotten together in bigger groups, big 
groups, in various places, such asthatf orestin the Matra Mountains. They were, of  course, 

scream ing and yelling anti
-
Jewish slogans. W egot right inthe m iddle of that.  
 
 
So we were ratherf rightened. T hese guys didn't look very hospitable, to say the least.  But 
that
 
was m yf irst directcontact with these Nazis.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  George, during thattim e andthe tim e leading up to the spring of 1944, when the 

Germ ans cam e in,how did your f am ily m anage to makeends meet?  Yourf atherhad been called up 
several tim es,
 
not work ing.  How did the fam ily m ake it? How did you eat?  
 
>> George Pick: W ell, I mentioned to you about the strohm ann system , and my f atherhad a very 

good business going, and so
 
--
 
andm y m other was also working as  a secretary, legal secretary f or 
an 
uncleof  hers, who was Jewish but he was a hero in thef irst world war, so he hadanexemptionand 

he was abletobea lawyer.  
 
Som y m other workedthere whenm yf atherwas awa y, and whenm y f ather was back he worked.  
 

 
So we scraped by.  Itwas hard.
  
Of  course,we had to give up a lot of  things, which we had 
bef ore.  But I would say that com pared to what hadhappened in Poland,Austriaand soforth, we 

couldn't com plain.  
 
 
One thing I wanted to tell you, before Iforget,is that we had relatives livin g in Slovakia and 
Austria,and these relatives showed up as refugees in 1942, 1941
-
42. T hey som ehow slipped 
through theborder.  Roughly 25,000 peoplefrom  Poland, Slovakia,andAustria were able to com e to 

 
ROUGH DRAFT  T RANSCRIPT

14
 
be refugees in Hungary.  
 
 
T hey were telling u
s the real situation there.  A f am ily, f or exam ple, escaped f rom  a ghetto just 
bef ore deportation,f rom  Bratislava. A grand
-
uncle was in Dachau. At that tim e, in 1940, if you had 
enough money, you could buy your way o w.  He bought his way outand came to
 
Hungary.  
 
 
T hey were telling us about thesehorrible things. W ehalf way believed them, half way didn't.  
W e ha d a
 
--
 
we were absolutely sure of onething:  It will never happen us to.  But we knew 
--
 
I would 
say we were inf orm ed, we didn't know, but we were informed,that indeed things were horrible all 

around us.

>> George Pick:  Yes. They thought they f ound safe refuge.  Ourf am ily actually had hidden them for 
two years.  T he way this operated, they went to one

the fam ilies, som ehow, were

>> George Pick:  March.  79 years ago yesterday.  They had brought with them Eichm annanda 
sm all groupof  SS in their comm ando. T his sm all group,maybe 120, went immediately towork.  
 
 
Now, these were the extremely experiencedpeople of how todeport and kill Jews.  It was a 
sm all number. W e're talking about
 
120 vs. 845,000.  But they found ready allies there. 
 
 
First of all, the governm ent becam ea pro
-
Nazi governm ent f rom  one day to the next.  T hey 
were gi ven orders, almost on adaily basis.  
 
 
I remember I was 10 years old, m y 10th birthday was the day whenI had to put a yellow star 
onm yself . My m otherand father, we were gi ven orders to provide all transportation, automobiles to 
bicycles, f rom  autom obiles tobicycles
 
--
  
>> Bill Benson: T hatwas 
--
 
they cam e inon the19th, your birthday is the28th. 
 
That was essentially 
ninedays later?  
 
>> George Pick:  Right.  In nine days, they gave probably 100 different orders. T hings were m ostly 

transportation and comm unication. T hat is telephoneshave to be disconnected and given.  Radios 
had to be given to
 
theNazis.  And, of course, valuables.  
 
 
So all of a sudden, virt ually one week, we we re completely cutoff f rom the rest of thefam ily.  I 
had roughly 160 relatives, andexceptf or those in Budapest we didn't know what happened to them , 
we didn't know what was going on inthe countryside.  
 
 
W hat was going on in the countryside was that by them iddle of April, three weeksaf terthey 
cam e in, they were already collected and concentrated the Jews toghettos.  Inthe m iddleof  May, 

that isam onth later, they started to deport them .  In six weeks, from the m iddle of May to July 6 or 
July 7, to be exact,437,000 people were deported,over 120 of m y fam ily members included.  95% 

 
ROUGH DRAFT  T RANSCRIPT

16
 
went to Auschwitz and 90% of who went toAuschwit z were gassed on arrival, essenti
a lly.   
 
 
So by July, by the beginning of  July, Hungary hadonly one Jewish comm unity lef t, and that 
was in Budapest. T hey were ready to start the Budapest Jews.  T hat was the largest comm unity, so 
they had som e logistics.  And the gendarmes, 33,000 people
 
who held these Jews to be deported 
f rom  the countryside, 3,000 of them  came toBudapest to start this process.  
 
>> Bill Benson: T o sort of summ arize, Eichmannand the Nazis went out into the countryside and 
clearedoutthe countryside of every Je w they couldf ind, leaving those that were still in Budapest.  As 
you said, in six weeks, 445,000 people, and I think you told me that worked out to about 12,000to 
14,000per day, during that six
-
week period,a total of 147 transport trains.  
 
>> George Pick:  Correct, yes. W e know this precisely, because there were people who were writing 

down thetrain numbers and car numbers,etc.  So we know precisely how m any people were.  
 
 
Just to give you a horrific statistic, when13,000,14,000 people showed up aday i
n  A u s ch wi tz,  
and10,000 were gassed, and their bodies were burned, the heatof theburning bodies blew up one 
of  the crem atoria. They were not designed to takethat many deadbodies.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Attheend of  that six
-
week period, about thattim e is when the heavy saturation 
bombing by theallies took place over Budapest.  
 
>> George Pick:  Yes. June 6 was D
-
Day, June 6 of 1944. By July, theallies were able toreach 
Budapest, their long
-
range bom bers.  On the 2nd of  July, which happened to be aSunday, I 
rem em ber it very well, they had thef irst saturationbom bing raidson Budapest. The saturation 

bombing raid destroyed about 30% of the city.  
 
 
Now, again, this was one of the lucky points. T here weref ourbom bs which f ell within about

200, 300m etersf rom the building in which we lived.  Thebuilding which we lived, as Bill showed 
already, was a Jewish building. W e hadto leave our regular apartmenton the27th of June.  So it 
was just the week bef ore this saturation bombing happened.  
 
 
A ll t h
e Jews, 160,000of  them in Budapest, were concentrated in 1900 rather dilapidated 
buildings. T hese were theones they called the starred buildings, or Jewish buildings.  
 
 
In the Jewish buildings there was always onefam ily who were Christ ian,mostly the 
super, and 
in this particular building the super was a Mr.
 
Varga.  His business was 
--
 
his duty was, actually, to 
close the doors and lock thedoors 22hours per day. W ehad two hours to go out andbuy f oodf or 

ourselves.  
 
 
Many of the localm erchants ref used to sell to us, and these two hours were in the late 
af ternoon, when eventhose m erchants who wouldbe willing to sell to us had nothing to sell.  So it 
was a real problem feeding ourselves at thatpoint.  
 
 
Now, af ter the 2nd of July and this saturationbombing raid, Horthy received a num berof  
m em orandaf rom  various people, according to the history books, and it's true,f rom  Roosevelt, 
Churchill, that if  they do not
 
--
 
if he doesn't stop the deportations of the Hungarian Budapest Jews, 
then there would be more andm ore raids like that.  
 
 
Sof inally he got the message, andon the6th of  July he stopped the deportations. There was 
onem ore train, 1200people, which Eichmann was able to sm uggle outof  the country, so to speak, 

f rom  a suburb of  Budapest
. Af te r tha t, it sto pp e d .  
 
 
My f ather, meanwhile, and m ost other Jewish m enf rom  18 to 60 were again brought into these 
slave labor cam ps.T his was in them iddle of April, som y f atherhad to go to the western part of

Budapest, where he was building def ense linesf or the Germans.  
 
 
T he Germ ansf igured that they would have to probably have a partwhere they would go back, 
but they wanted to slow down, of  course. So m y father didthisf rom April to October.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Of 1944?  
 
>>
 
George Pick:  Of 1944.  That sum mer, exceptfor the bombing raids, it wasfairly " quiet."  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Although thebom bing continued.  
 
>> George Pick: T hebombing continued twice aday, yes.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  You said the Am ericans would bom b in
 
them orning, the Russians in the evening.  
You would sort of plan your forays out around in between the bombing schedule.

af ter this bom bing, I was terribly af raid. If  you can im agine this 
saturation bombing, itwas horrible, three hours.  My m otherputa big pillo w on m y head so that to

I had apillow on m y head. It was ratherpsychologically im pressed,im pressedme quite abit.  I am 
still af raid.  If Iheara noise which is unexpected, then I get sort of
 
--
  
>> Bill Benson:  So George, it was, andthis is ver y relative, it was rel atively calm  f orthat period 

during the summer months.  But then whathappened in Octoberto change all of  thatagain?  
 
>> George Pick: W ell, m y father cam eback. His unit was backto Budapest.  October15was a ver y 

big day, because Horthy, too little, too late, decided todothe" honorable thing,"  andhehad a radio 
broadcast saying thatHungary is going to ge t out of the war, it wi ll be neutral.  
 
 
Now, in August of thesam e year, that is af ew m onthsbefore, theRom aniansalready did that, 
andthe Romanians switched sides. The Romanianf orcesnow fought with theSoviets, instea
d  of

against, andtheforces were already in eastern border of Hungary.  So it was rather latetom ake a 
m eek attem ptat getting out. Andthism eek attem pt was doom edtofailure.  Wethought, we were 
hoping thatm aybe wewould survi ve.
 
but in two hours,the governm ent com pletely collapsed, Horthy was arrested, hisfam ily deported 

actually, and the Arrow Cross, the mostextrem e Nazi Hungarians took over.  
 
 
Eichmann, who lef t inJuly, cam eback,and 10 days later thef irst 10,000 young wom en, 
am ong them  several of m y aunts, were rounded up anddeported.  And after that, 50,000, roughly 
50,000 Jews f rom  Budapest were deported, between October15and Decem ber 1. 
 
>> Bill Benson: T he im portant thing,among m any, to think about here is this is justm onths befo
re  

the war is going to beover.  T hey're losing badly, com pletedefensive situation, and yet there's 
Eichmann back with avengeance, to use that opportunity to get the last of the Jews outof Budapest.  
 
>> George Pick:  Yes.  Eichmann was obsessive about this,and Himm ler anda lot of these
 
--
 
and 
Hitler, of  course, they were obsessive.  They didn't care what happens with the war. T heyfelt they 
could kill every last Jew, then even if they lose the war they won the war.  
 
 
It's am azing, if  you think about
 
it.  Now we have less than 100,000 Jews in Budapest. T herest 
of  them already were deported. And why?  Just to give you an illustration, by then the trains were 

stopped running,or the trains were running to the west but they didn't have room for the Je
ws .   S o  
the Jews were forced to walk, in Novem ber,December, orOctober, Novem ber of 1944,f rom  
Budapest tothe Austrian border. That's 200kilom eters.  50% didn't m ake it.  
 
 
T he Hungarian Nazis shoteverybody who sat down.  So 50% didn'tm ake it, andth
e Nazis  
were rather disappointed. They wanted to have able
-
bodied peoplefor work.  At thatpoint, they were 

 
ROUGH DRAFT  T RANSCRIPT

stopping already. T hey wanted workers.  They didn't get anything.  They got skin and bone people 
who could hardly walk.  
 
 
W hat happened then is m y father got a call
-
up.  Inf act, hisunit comm ander told him and his 
unit they were going to bedeported. T his was at theend of October.  
 
 
T he unit comm ander was, again, a lucky star,he was a very, very nic e guy.  He had a Jewis h 
f iancee who happened
 
to live in ourbuilding,and200 slave laborers got 24hoursf urlough.  He told 
them  thattom orrow m orning we're going to get you ina train, and we will take you to Germany to 
wo r k .   
 
 
Som y f ather came hom e
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  He said you can have afurlough before we dothat?  
 
>> George Pick:  Right.  You get a one
-
dayf urlough,f rom whatever, m orning to the next day.  
 
 
Som y f ather,obviously, didn't want to get deported, andhehad aplan, which didn't work out, 
with anotherf riendof  his.  Then he
 
was, by the evening, he was absolutely f rightened.  Hewent to 
anotherf riend of his,abusiness associate. He said, Guys, I'm going to be deported in lessthan 10 

hours,and I need someplace to go.  Can you helpm e?  
 
 
T hisfellow, Gyekis, had apartner
 
who were not Jews, Rangberg.  He gave them m oney torun 
thebusiness.  Gyekis, we didn't know it, but he was workin g with the Hungarian resistance.  
 
 
So he toldm y f ather,he gave him  a piece ofpaper, said, well, go to this particular address, 
and it is
 
a textile factory, and find thisparticular person, hisnam e isRaju, he will take you.  
 
 
Som y f ather went there,f ound Raju, who happenedtobe the sam e person as Rangberg, and 
theplace was the textile f actory f or the Hungarian arm y uniform s.There was a big sign on thedoor.

For all practicalpurposes, that's what he saw.  There was abig wall.  
 
 
It turns out this was ahiding placefor roughly 70 Jewish slave laborers who, just like m y 
father, were able to get outand able tof ind this place.  
 
 W
edidn't know what happened to m yf ather,com pletely.  Af ter he lef t, we didn't know 
anything, until roughly them iddle of Novem ber. T hen we got the piece of paperf rom him , brought in 

by a Hungarian soldier, and the paper was very sim ple, it says " George
 
and Margit, please 
im mediately pack whatever you need, m inim al am ounts, and comewith this soldier."   
 
 
But we didn't do that, but we endedupa couple hours later inthat sam eplace. T he reason 
wh y we couldn'tdo it is we got into raid,a Nazi, couple Nazi teenagers came inand raided our 

building and stole whatever they could, so we couldn't leave.  By thetim e the raid was over, the 
curfew hours cam e in. 
 
 
So we asked tobe let out, we had the yellow star, and we went to this hiding place wherem y 
fa t
her was.  Once wewere there, wef oundout thatm any of thesem en didthe sameasm y f ather 

did, that istobring their fam ilies in.  
 
 
T hey had information that thedeportationsf rom these Jewish houses started inearnest, so 
they felt thatpeople were much saf er in thishiding place. T hat's how we got here.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  George, soeverybody understands that, this was,for theoutside world as far asthey 

were concerned, it was anoperating uniform

m akingf actory, andthat everybody in therewas m ak

unif orm sf or the Hungarian arm y.

>> George Pick:  Right.  That's what I thought I said.  
 
>> Bill Benson: 
 
Just to m ake sure we got that.  
 
>> George Pick:  Yeah.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Now it had kids inthere.  
 
>> George Pick:  Right.  Ithad 170 people, and the kids, roughly 22kids.  We didn't know af ter that 
what hadhappened tothe people who stayed behind.
  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Of  course.  
 
>> George Pick: W efound out after the war, what happened isthevery f irst next morning that 
particular building was surroundedby Nazis.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Your building.  
 
>> George Pick: T hebuilding where we were afew hours earlier was surrounded by Nazi s and they 
were taken to the brick factory.  Usually, thebrick f actories, which were on the border of the city, they 
were the ones where the transit cam ps.  From  there,they were sending collectively a couple 
thousan
d people, then sendthem  to the west.  
 
 
Now, in this group,f rom m y building, there was m y grandmother and two of  her sisters. They 
were there. T hey were  over 70 years old ladies, and Mr.
 
Varga who knew thefam ily for 20 years 
went to an uncle ora brother of theirs, who was already under theprotection of W allenberg, he lived 
in a protectedbuilding, and told him that histhree sistersare to be deported,and m y great

calledW allenberg's office, and som ebody we nt and picked them  up and brought them  out. But the 
rest of the building was deported.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Just hours af ter you lef t?  
 
>> George Pick:  Justhours.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  George, our time is very shor t.  Yet, there's som uch m oref or you to tellus.  As best 

you can,once you're in the textile or theuniform
-
making f actory, what happened there until your 
liberation?  
 
>> George Pick:  OK,well, ver y, ver y brief ly what happened is, if you imagine 170 people,that'sa 
pretty big logistics problem  tof eedthem . T here was
 
--
 
we didn't know it, but there were several 
groups behind this.  They f ed us and so forth.  
 
 
It was a very hard lif e.  Of course, thebom bing raids still going on. W e couldn'tm ake any 
noise. Nobody could see thatpeople came in or out. W e were essentially very m uch locked up 

there.  
 
 
T henon December2, there was a raidonus. The Hungarian gestapof ound out.  It's a long 
story, but we were betrayed, or the leaderof  the group was betrayed.  
 
 
T he gestapopeople cam e in, they saw that am an and wom an and children out, we thought 
they were going to m assacre us there, but they didn't because we were able tobribe them .  
 
 
Af ter that, they said we were under their protection. Afew days af ter that, the leadersof  this 
group where we were decided thatthe children
 
would be takentoa Red Cross orphanage.  I was 
am ong the older ones. The youngest was 6m onthsold. 22of uswent there.  Or they took us there.  
 
 
It was a horribleplace.  500 kids,35toa room . Very few peoplearound, no food, and af riend

of  m i n e
 
and I decided to escape.  T he nextmorning, we escapedf rom  thatparticular building, which 
was lucky f or us because a few days later these children were taken to the Danube and shot at the 
Danube.  
 
 
So we went back to our parents, andaf ew days af terthat two off icers of  the
 
--
 
t wo  of f ice rs 
cam e, and they toldus that now there is a ghetto.  A ghetto openedat the endof  November in 
Budapest.  A large ghetto opened, and theonly ghetto which survi ve d, actually.  
 
 
So we were taken there, out of the 170,
 
65 went to the ghetto, the rest escaped. W e were one 
of  them.  My father becam e apolice there.  Mostly, thesepolice," Jewish police,"  were there to 

protectthe Jews.  But he got thenightstick and the white thing, white band, which said that he's a 
Je w
ish police.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  You were in an old building, a large oldbuilding.  How m any of  you were in there?  
 
>> George Pick: We were roughl y 200,of  whom about 22 was f rom  our group, and the rest of them  
were old peoplef rom an old

age hom e, Jewis h
 
o ld
-
age hom e.  
 
 
W e weren't in the building ver y long, because by Decem ber 24 afull siege of  Budapest had 
begun. Soeverybody ran down to the basement,and the people, the oldpeople died, one, two, 
three,foura day, m ostly of  starvation. T he ghettoh
ad f ood.  T hat was not a problem .  The problem  
was how do you get thefood and bring it back?

shot. But we found our grandparents, hisparents,there.  Andhedid thisbecauseof  double rations.  
He broughtus som ef ood,but it was notenough.  
 
By the end of Decem ber, beginning of January, theW allenberg people cam e in.  
W allenbergf elt that, by then, things were ver y, ver y dangerous.T he Arrow Cross no longer had any 
respectfor the paperswhich these people had. T hey shot them  by the hundreds. 
 
 
10,000of  them  cam e
 
into the ghetto, this was January 4, and by then the ghettohad 70,000 
people.  From  January 4 to January 18, which is essentially two weeks, we had nof ood.Som ostof  
thepeople who died there just starved.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  It wasalso an especially brutal winter, wasn't it?  
 
>> George Pick:  Especially brutal winter.  T he Danubehad com pletely f rozen up.  Of course, where 
we were there was noelectricity or water. W e didour thing 
--
 
thebasement was such anold building, 
had no f loor, but it was j
ust dust,dirt.  So we hada big hole in themiddle. That was the latrine.  You 
can imagine the stink, the lice;no conditions,of  course,for being able to washourselves.  
 
 
T hen on the 18th

or the 17th, m yf ather came hom e, orback into the bunker. 
 
W hen we had

up in thef ighting, and the bodies were collected andwere taken to a centersquare, 
right in f rontof  thebuilding,f acing the square.  
 
 
In the squarethere were m aybe3,000f rozen bodies.  So by the 18th the Russians cam e in,
 
andthen we went home.  
 
 
T here was no celebration.  W edidnot know even how m any peoplewere ali ve or dead,but we 
knew that we wanted to go back where we cam ef rom , or what apartm ent we camef rom .Some

Most of them  were in Budapest, yes.

would endup living under com munist rule inHungary until 1956 when he escapedf rom  Hungary.  So 
we could bring you back and have a postwardiscussion that would take a long time as well .
