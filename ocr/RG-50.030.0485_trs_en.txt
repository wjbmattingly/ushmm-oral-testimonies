Ukraine, it™s -- ma ybe it™s the second one. 
 
Q: Near the Nyepper river, yes? 

 

A: Yes, the Nyepper river, yeah. And my 
father came  to Dnepr opetrovsk from a s mall

Q: But still in Ukraine? 

 

A: It™s still Ukraine. And my grandmother, sh
e was very, very religious
, very, very religious. 
But when all this re volut ion came to this pla
ce, and with all this [indecipherable] that 
they givesome freedom to th
e people, so my father, who wa
s actually a -- a -- a head of 
school student, so he went to the school 
in Dnepropetrovsk, and he is got a job in 
Dnepropetrovsk, and this is where he me t my
 mo m. And whe n the war start, I wasn™t 

more than three year old. I 
was not so little
, not so -- 
 

Q: But then you certainly were not big, you were -- 

 

A: [indecipherable] was still a 
[indecipherable] yeah, not so bi
g. And I had a brother on this 
time, his name was Jakob. So from Dnepropetr
ovsk, it was a little bit more organisi -- 
organized, the system where they tried to 
put people -- evacuate 
when the Germans was 
close to Dnepropetrovsk. So this is why we 
was able to get on th
e train, on the -- and 
move some where and on the sa -- to the sa
fe place. And with 
my mo m was her younger 
sister, with my brother, because she went to
 help my mo m. The -- my brother was about 
four months old.  
 

Q: Ah, so he was even younger than you. 

 

A: After he was born, I wen -- wor -- yeah, he 
was about four -- four months old. So -- and 
we is tryi ng to get some where to the flash -- 
safe place. Actually, we didn™t choose it, but 

the -- the train know the directi
on and they tried to bring us
 some where where it™s safe. 
So during this sis -- time when we tried to get 
at the safe place, so is -- our train was 
destroyed by the Germans a few times. And once, Mom™ s sister came  wi thout the baby. 

She said he did not had food and he died. 
And she left him some where, and she came 
alone, without [indecipherable]. So what we
 can do. So -- and the time  was very, very 
pressed, so they ma nage give us a few -- a 
-- a new train, so -- and 
train went some where 
else. So on the time when we came t o this place, where can see that it™s like very safe. So 

it was me  and my mo m and her sister. 
 

Q: So let me  ask you some t hing. From Dnepropetrovsk -- 

 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: -- you and your mother left separately?

A: Mom™ s sister li-lived also Dnepropetrovs
k. Mom™s -- my mo m™ s mother, she got fi -- she

moved with the older daughter family. And this 
sister stayed with us, and she helped us 
[indecipherable] from Dnepropetrovsk area. 
 

Q: So how did it happen that your mo
ther™s sister, with the baby --

place and said, what will be next? So
 she met again me and my mo m --

A: Yeah, she was very devastated, and she never 
know anything about th

mom™ s sister, my aunt, actually she never talk 
about it any more. And well, this is another 
story because as I said that it cames me  -- 
it came to my mi nd that no, maybe he is alive 
some where, because when I was mor e  than 
20 year old, after my 
technical school, I was 
sent to one pl ace in Ukraine also, but it was so
me where, and this is between these pl aces 
where our train moved. And I me - meet one guy, a

guy, he looks like you.ﬂ And I said, ﬁWell, howa guy can look like me ? ﬂ  What he said, 

it™s -- he said, ﬁYes, he looks 
like you.ﬂ And I went away fr
om hi m and later I came to -- 
when it come to my mi nd what it can happen, 
I came back to meet him, and I can never 
meet hi m, s o this is -- well maybe in another life. 
 

Q: So, are you really suspicious that some body -- 

 

A: Well, I really suspicious because alya  -- my
 mo m died about six years ago, and the sister, 
she died recently in Israel. When I call her,
 I said, ﬁCan you tell me  the story, exactly? ﬂ  
She s -- where you -- had you seen him die, had you -- you put him, and you bury him?  

She said, ﬁNo, they came and they put him to the -- they pick him up and they put him 

some where to the hospital or some thing like 
this. So that™s why it™s come to my mi nd 
ma ybe.

 the army, on the [indeci

Q: Uh-huh, so they both worked? 

 

A: Yeah, they both worked. 

 

Q: Was that usual in Ukraine, and in the -- in 
the Soviet Union, that both mother and father 
would work? 
 

A: Sure, sure it was, you know --

Q: Right. Do you know where -- do you reme mber 
any of this -- this 
train trip?  Or do -- 
 

A: Well, I --  I reme mber a few things that fi rs
t of all -- I don™t reme m 
-- it™s very strange, but 
I don™t reme mber my br other, actually, that I 
can tell them that I reme mb er my brother. 
But I reme mber a room really, I remember some t oys, I remember the horses they 

brought me  as a gift. I took enough, and took a l
ook what is inside. And I reme mber that 
was -- it was like a trip, so it™s a few times
. I reme mber the noise of these planes. I 
reme mber the fire, and I reme mber that when
 -- a few times I saw that when all these 
people from the train, when they go so
me , no one know -- knows where to go. Some  

[indecipherable] goes ahead, and no one knows 
where -- what we have to do. And it was 
like -- it™s ve ry strange, it was like -- I don™t 
know, is -- or they made it like by military 
sanction. It was like on the sky, diffe
rent colors like a half o -- 
of the si -- what is it?  How 
do they call it? 
 

Q: Arainbow? 

 

A: Like -- like a half of th
e moon, you know, but it was like di
fferent -- different bright 
color. And some one said because this is he
re -- this is the point where we can go, we 
have to go back. There™s no way to go -- to go 
further, so -- and we went back. And it lo-

look -- look like -- it looks like some house, 
or some  -- I don™t know what -- all people 
will -- they listen what they said. One of th
e guys said where we have to go. Because it™s 
not like you buy a ticket and you go, this
 [indecipherable] and say go.  
 

Q: Do you remember being afraid on that trip? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0485  
6 
 
 
A: Yes. 

 

Q: Youdo. 

 

A: I reme mber that I was afraid, and I reme mber
 that -- the noise in this bombing is st ill in 
my -- some times when I sleep -- 
 

Q: You can hear? 

 

A: -- it comes here, yeah, I can hear it so metimes. 

 

Q: Do you have bad dreams now, with reme mbering it some times ? 

 

A: About this time  -- well, I just more reme
mber that it was a lot 
people that going, they 
don™t know where to go, and this is different 
color, like [indeciphera
ble] that people say 
you cannot go here. This is what I reme mber. 
 

Q: Now you we re going in a s
outheastern direction, right? 
 

A: Yeah, we -- we went to we
st -- west south -- southwest di
rection, because it was far away 
from the German border and thing like this. So
 -- and we stay here almost a year before 
German ca me  to this place. So because 
German came to this place where you finally 
[indecipherable], in August, 1942. So the war 
began on July ™41, so it was more than a 
year. So the war was very, very -- on the hi
gh leve l on this time. And -- but because  -- I 

don™t know the -- how they call 
it, they call it like Voencoma
t -- Voencomat, it™s military 
commission in these places. So they got an
 order to take care about families whose 

fathers on the f -- on the ar -- in 
the ar my. So because this is a help, this apartment, a help 
is found the job for -- for Mom, and s o me
 -- every month Mom receives some money 
from the -- like from the government because 
our father is in the military. So -- and we 
stay here, mom -- it was very difficult, but 
no one knows -- everyone kno
ws that this is a 
war, no one knows if your father will be alive 
or not. And we spent li
ke a year like this. 
And -- 
 

Q: And where -- do you know where you were for that year? 

 

A: Yeah, I know I wa -- it 
was a -- near Stavropol. 
 

Q: It was near Stavropol? 

 

A: Near Stavropol, yeah Bes
hbagir they call it, Beshbagir,
 like suburb -- suburb sa -- 
Stavropol. 
 

Q: Asuburb? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0485  
7 
 
A: Suburb Stavropol, and it™s agriculture actuall
y, a place -- agriculture mo
st -- in this time it 
was most agriculture 
places, not industry. 
 
Q: Right. 

 

A: And so they got a new friends, and the pe
ople who was here, from -- the Russian people, 
well, they was not --  they actually afraid to be anti-Semitic, very, very, because actually 

they should take care about families who was 
-- came from this -- the territory that you 

know, like the -- they ra -- ran 
away from the Germans so, it was -- everything looks not 
very friendly. So -- and what happened when ger -- when Germans al most came to this 

place, so Mom took me , and we tried to run 
away from this place. No one knows where, 

but some one said that we™ll -- we will got 
the directions. Germans here, let™s go to 
another pl ace. It was again when we came, I see the same  line, with the same  -- the same  

[indecipherable] as I said, no place to go. And 
where to go, no one knows where to go. So 
we came ba ck to the same  place in this Stavropol, and my neighbors said to my mom, 

ﬁYou know what?  This is what I can tell 
you. You look like Russian village woma n, so 
no one cra -- can recognize you that you are Je
w, and no one will ask you. You can take a 
name , like Russian name , like Vera, and tell
 that you are Vera, you don™t have passport. 

The passport -- passport was some where destro
yed. And let me  take care about your son, 
because toge ther you will never survive. You wi
ll never find a apartment to stay together. 
Who will take care [indecipherable] keep. A
nd between these Russians villages, you will 
find some thing and you will survive.ﬂ So Mo
m decided -- and Mom told me that, ﬁYou 
know what, I will leave you with this very 
nice -- very nice pe rson, don™t worry, I will 
come  back to pick up you. And because Germans 
want to kill us.ﬂ She afraid to told me  
they want to kill us because we are Jewish, b
ecause she afraid that -- if I will play with 
kids, sometimes I can tell them that I am a 
Jew. And I also look like -- like a -- like a 
Russian boy. I was a blonde
, with a --  this -- 
 

Q: With round fa -- 

 

A: -- hair, yeah, with a round face, w
ith this all -- my hair was like this. 
 

Q: Longhair. 

 

A: Yeah, long hair. 

 

Q: Uh-huh. 

 

A: And -- and Mom said what I can do, this is 
the wa y -- this is what
 I can -- can do, I am 
very sorry but -- 
 

Q: Do you re -- 

 

A: -- and she left  me with this woman. 

 

Q: Do you remember her talking to you?

A: I -- I reme m -- I reme m -- I remember sh -- sh
 -- she talked to me, and she told me why, 
and what™s strange, I was like -- like a person 
who obey orders. I did 
not cry, I did not ask 
why. I did not cry that I want 
go to my mo m. She said me  that we have to do it, I said 
okay, we have to do it. And ali -- I often 
ask me  how come , because now, when my  
grandkids stay -- the first time our gra -- wh
en they wer -- w-we told them, ﬁCan you go 
some where to vacation, and we will st ay with your boy.ﬂ He was just born. And she cried 

first day, we cannot stop him. He wa nt mo mmy a
nd that is it. And I never said that I wa nt 
mommy. Mommy told me  that we have to
 do it like this. So we did it like this. 
 

Q: Do you remember her hugging you? 

 

A: Mom, yes, s h -- 

 

Q: Was she -- 

 

A: -- I reme mb er her hugging me, I remember her kissing me, and I reme mbe r  her -- her 
crying. 
 

Q: Wa -- but she was crying? 

 

A: She crying, but I was not. I said, ﬁWell,Mommy says that we have to do it, because 
someone want to come to kill us.ﬂ So -- and two days I was in this -- 
 

Q: And you we re four years old? 

 
A: I was -- 
 

Q: Or is this five? 

 

A: -- only three -- three -- four -- four -- 

 

Q: Four. 

 

A: Four -- ‚42
nd
, I was four. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: So -- and on the second day, this woma n, sh
e got a German boyfriend, a big one. For me  
it was like a -- I said a very, very big one, w
ith the big shoes, so -- and he came, and he 
pick me  up, and he said, ﬁI know that you are Jewi sh, you will go with me .ﬂ And even -- 

even this time , I don™t reme mber me crying. He 
said, ﬁLet™s go.ﬂ I sai
d, ﬁLet™s go.ﬂ So he 
put me  on -- on his vehicle, and he brought me  to -- 
 

Q: What did he have, a motorcycle?

A: Yes, h-he got a motorcycle with this --  with carriage. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: So he put me on the carriage, he put me  in
 this motorcycle, and he brought me  to one 
place. To be honest with you, I am not sure it 
was a synagogue, or a -- previous synag -- 
or it was some thing -- what kind of place wa
s it, but it was about hundred people inside. 

Overy -- everyone was part of the family. They collect them from different places, they 

brought them all them together, they assemble
d them together. So -- and I was just by 
myself. And -- 
 

Q: Can I interrupt for one 
minute?  Take off your ring. 
 

A: I™msorry? 

 

Q: Take off your ring. 

Q2: It™s hi s watch. 

 

Q: Is -- is it the 
watch that™s doing it? 
Q2: It™s the watch that  -- yeah -- 

 

A: Thewatch? 

 

Q: So take off the watch, because you™re banging it -- 

 

A: Oh, I™m sorry. 
 
Q: That™s fi ne, that™s terrific. 

 

A: I™m sorry about that. 

 

Q: Okay. No, no, no, no, no, don™t be sorr
y, I didn™t want to interrupt you. 

 

A: [indecipherable] 

 

Q: Okay, so they took you to -- and you™re 
not s-sure if it™s 
the synagogue, or -- 
 

A: I -- to be honest with, it 
-- me mber -- I tried to understa
nd, it looks like it was a small -- 
not big synagogue. 
 

Q: Mm-h m.  

 

A: Because I don™t remember any church let™s 
say equipment like crisis or so mething like 
this. It looks like -- seems to me  that it was a synagogue.  
 

Q: Mm-h m.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0485  
10 
 
 
A: And my wi fe said me , ﬁWhere they got s
ynagogue in Beshbagir?ﬂ And I said, ﬁWell, if 
they got hundred people to bring them toge
ther -- or more than hundred, ma ybe they 
got,ﬂ -- anyway it was -- it was 
in service, or it was -- 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: -- previous synagogue. 

 

Q: Let me  -- let me  go back for a mo me
nt. How do you now understand this woma n who 
clearly seemed to be trying to help your mo
ther and you, and in a day she gets a German 
boyfriend?  
 

A: Yes, why not? 

 

Q: Okay. 

 

A: It™s their philosophy, she got
 -- well, you know, when Ger mans came, so they came there 
let™s say [indecipherable] they -- they believe that
 is forever. If she kne
w that is for a half 
a year maybe her behavior will be di -- 
 

Q: Different,right. 

 

A: -- was be different, but she believed that is
 forever. So that is why she said well -- no one 
force her, teln her this Jewish guy, but she ha
s to explain him where she got this guy -- 
where she got me . And as a Jewish boy, ma ybe 
I got something that if they will take a 
look at this, they will 
found that I am a Jewish. 
 

Q: Yeah,right. 

 

A: So -- and so they brought me  to this pl ace. No one gave us food, no one, but because it 
was fa milies, they got something with them. And I reme mber me that I go -- I am alone, 

no one else, four year boy, no one else. So a
nd I took a look one fa mily, another family. I 
took a look one fa mily they -- I remember th
ey eat things like bread with honey. So I 

took a look on him, he s a id, ﬁMaybe -- wh-whe
re is your Mom? ﬂ I said, ﬁI don™t have my 
Mom here, by [indecipherable] self.ﬂ He star
t crying, and sa -- it was a -- a Jewish man 
with a build -- I -- I 
don™t know his name , what -- I don™
t know how he looks like, his 
glasses. So -- and he -- he  gave me  a 
piece of bread with honey and said, ﬁTake it, 

please.ﬂ And he is crying, and I said, ﬁ Why he
 is crying?ﬂ I did not understand what they 
going to do here. I don™t understand why all th
ese peoples here, I 
even don™t understand 
why this guy brought me here. We ll, I understa
nd ma ybe she doesn™t want me  stay with 
her, she gave me someone else, and that 
is it. And it was like, you know, like a sign, I 
don™t know, that I said to them, ﬁI want to 
go to ma ke pee-pee.ﬂ And the guy who was in 
-- on the door, he said [indecipherable] it wa
s a fe nce around, it was not just -- he said, 
ﬁOkay, you can go.ﬂ So when I came  and wi -- 
to ma ke a pee-pee 
it was like a wooden 
cabin with so mething in the fl oor. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0485  
11 
 
 
Q: It™s a -- it™s an outhouse. 

 

A: Yeah, outside , but you can ma ke a pee-pee. 
So I came  to this place, and another guy. I 
look at him, and he worked with horses. He 
clean a ho -- a horse. He look at me , he look 
on this door, he looked at -- I came along from th
is place, and he came to me , and he s a id, 
ﬁListen, all these people will be
 killed. And I will try to 
sa ve you. Don™t sa y a word. I 
will bring you a carriage, and I will bring you 
to a safe place.ﬂ S -- and he -- he work -- 
he work like with them, but it was -- he wa
s like part on something like underground or 
some thing like this. So he put me  in this 
carriage, and he brought
 me -- it was about, in 
my understanding, at least 30 mi nutes, 40 mi nutes
 drive on this place. And he reveals a 
big, big forest, and he said, ﬁStay here. I be
 back.ﬂ And what I reme mber, it was very, 
very, very ti -- this was real time , and I star
t to worry, because he did not come  back, and 
I don™t know where to go from here. And it was 
a forest, and just me  and the -- and the 
horse. So I don™t know what I have
 to do, where I had to go, so -- 
 

Q: So the horse was with you? 

 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: The horse and carriage? 

 

A: He left the horse with me , and said stay 
here. He put this horse around the tree, and said 
stay with me .  
 

Q: Right. 
 
A: So he came some where. It looks like he came 
to get some  orders, or some  direction what 
he has to do. And he came [indecipherable] that  he save one guy. I don™t know if he told 

them that he™s Jewish or not Jewish, ma ybe 
[indecipherable] and he 
said what -- what is 
next I can do. So a -- now he came back. He br
ought -- he put me  -- he -- we continue our 
-- this jour ne y, so we came  to one place in di fferent town. And we ca -- he came to the 

woma n, the woma n was pregnant 
and she got four kids. And he
 said, this kid I brought 
you, this ki d has to stay in your house for a 
couple days, and we will find for him a pl ace. 
She start cryi ng, she said, ﬁTake him away, I 
don™t want him because I have  three and I 
expect another one, and it™s very dangerous 
for me and for my  fa mily. I don™t want him, 
take him away.ﬂ Because I understand for 
Ger mans is [indecipherabl e] said, ﬁDon™t 
worry. We  will find place for him.ﬂ So th
ey put me under the bed, and they put 
watermelons around me. They cover me --  
 

Q: Watermelons? 

 

A: Watermelons. It was time -- it was like the end of the autumn , it was about ma ybe 
August, the end of the August, September, so 
they put a lot out, and they said, ﬁYou have 
to stay he re, don™t go, and don™t cry. But you ha
ve to stay here unless we will call you. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0485

Don™t go away, stay here.ﬂ And it was about ma
ybe two days when I was in this position. 
So later someone came, and the -- it was almost -- 
 
Q: Well what did you -- do you re
me mb er being in that -- 
 

A: Yeah, I reme mber like now, I reme mber y -- ow --  

 

Q: So you -- 

 

A: -- I reme mb ering how this bed was covered w
ith some thing like -- like gray cover, and it 
was a long one, so when some one come  in, and they would like to take a look, they open 

it and they see just watermelon [inde ciphera
ble]. So they did not search. I reme m-
reme mber that one guy came  and said, ﬁ Wha
t do you have? ﬂ  And she said, ﬁNothing.ﬂ So 
he -- he open it. I reme mber the -- how -- he 
open it, because I see -- I saw that some thing 
-- light came  to me , but I says I was told.  
 

Q: You did exactly what you -- 

 

A: Don™t -- don™t be -- yeah, don™t -- don™t 
open your mouth. So -- and this [indecipherable] 
me , and later they found the couple, and as I 
remember it was a Polish couple, they we re 
not young, but they were -- they was without 
children, childre -- childrenless -- how™s it 
go? 
 

Q: Childless. 

 

A: Childless. 
 
Q: Yes. 

 

A: So and they look at -- at me , 
and they said well they -- they
 understand that action is not -
- it™s not safe to have a child, because rumors can be around. But because they did not 

have kids, they decided that they want  me  to
 be in their family, because as this guy said, 
her mo m is died, no one [i ndecipherable] he 
did not tell that Mom around, she will pi ck 
him up. And -- 
 

Q: Did you tell him that your mother wa
s alive?  We re -- could you speak well? 
 

A: Well I -- yeah, sh-she ask me , ﬁ Well, where™
s your mo m? ﬂ I telled her then that my mom, 
she went, and I don™t know
 where sh-she™s -- 
 

Q: Uh-huh. 

 

A: -- she [indecipherable]. I know what she told me
 that she left -- I to
ld them the story, how 
I came to there.  
 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0485

A: And I reme mber the woma n said, ﬁYou -- I™m asking you, I™m begging you, don™t tell 
anyone about this. Te ll everyone that we are your
 parents, and this is just the way that 
you can survive. Because if not, they going to
 kill you, and they going to kill us.ﬂ  And 
when I was in this family, as I reme mber, it was long enough, because when -- when the 

Germans wa s in this place about a half a year
. It was -- they came like suddenly from the 
sky as paratroopers. They put the paratroopers 
to take this place fr
om the Russians during 
the war. And, you know, half a year, they forced
 leave this place. Half a year. So they 
occupied this place like half a year. But from 
thi -- I believe it was mo
re than half a year 
when I first saw my mo m, because when she came , I did not recognize he r. She was 

alive, and because she was -- she looked like Ru
ssian, so with this name  like Vera, so she 
survive. Wh en she survived, she start looki
ng for me . She start ask one, another one, you 
know?  And finally she find the family where I wa
s. And this fa mily tell to them, ﬁListen, 
you know if your fa -- if your husband willcome . You don™t know how you can survive, 

okay?  And you are actually, you are not old woma n, you can have kids more if your 

husband will come  or not, you will ha ve in your fa mily. Let him stay with us. We  will 

like him so mu -- much, and he fa -- he forg
et about you.ﬂ He forg
et hismom. And Mom 
-- Mom came to me, and someone called me. I reme mber the face of this woman that I 

live in the family. She was very, very like sa -- a very -- very worry about this mo me nt. 

And she said, ﬁDo you know this woma n? ﬂ And 
I came, look at her, I said, ﬁNo. It™s -- 
it™s -- I don™t know this woma n, she just came  
to take me . I don™t want go from here. I 
don™t want go anywhere from here.ﬂ And as
 I told you, she -- he doesn™t reme mber you. 
And it was time  that -- ac tually it was for Mo
m was difficult even to prove that I am her 
son, because no docume nts, nothing. Maybe they s -- in some  ways they be lieve  ma ybe 

it™s not my mom also, but they was not happy 
to give me  back. It was a sad day. And -- 
but I believe it was about -- about
 a year, ma ybe like -- that I st
ay in this family. So in a 
couple months my mom came back. And she ch 
-- she change her dress. She came in the 
same dress that she left, and she make her ha
ir in the same  way. And I took a look on her, 
and I said, ﬁMy mo m came to pick me  up.ﬂ So I  came to kiss her, and she asks I want to 

st -- with their permission that I have to st
ay additional month, she 
has to prepare somethi 
-- some wheres to take me.  
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: And this is how it was. 

 

Q: Right. We  have to change the tape. 

 

End of Tape #1

Tape #2 
 
Q: I think I asked you a question before -- 

 

A: Yeah [indecipherabl e]  

 

Q: -- you had this little coughing spurt. 

 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: Which -- a question you couldn™t possibly 
actually figure out an answer to -- 
 

A: Well, I -- 

 

Q: -- was how would they expl
ain this four year old boy? 
 

A: First of all they was not -- not so ol
d. They was ma  -- ma ybe  in their 30™s. 
 

Q: Uh-huh. 

 

A: And the second -- the second 
thing was I reme mber -- I know -- I don™t reme mber even 
ever play with any kids, so I th
ink they did not let me  go, they 
want keep me  in -- in -- in 
house mostly. And well, i-it -- it -- it wa
s dangerous because maybe if someone -- 
 

Q: Wouldsee. 

 
A: -- gives them a -- give alert to the Germans, so
 ma ybe they have to explain this in some  --  
 
Q: Right. 

 

A: -- in some  way -- in some ways. But well, 
from -- from the understanding, ma -- from my 
understanding, they got like an
 excuse, they never know th
at it™s Jewish boy, they ne-
never check it. Some one said it™s a boy, no he 
doesn™t have parents, they want them to 
keep him. So it would be like -- for them it c
ould be like an e -- they can -- can admit it 
like an excuse for themself to
 -- if someone will question it. 
 

Q: Right. And do you reme mber staying inside most of the time? 
 
A: Yes, I remember I™m staying in 
-- stayed mo -- most of the time. 
 

Q: And were you unhappy about that, or
 did they explain to you why? 
 

A: Well, they tried to entertain me  in the hous
e. They got a lot toys, that I never got. And 
they tried to take care about me very, very
 well, because as I sa id like -- they guess 
maybe it will be thei r child, so I reme mber that well, they tried to give me -- where they 

got it I don™t know, but the food was very, very nice. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0485  
15 
 
 
Q: Really? 

 

A: Yeah, but as I said, it was lik
e agriculture place, so the gr
ound -- they got some  food from 
the -- from the ground. I don™t know their occupati
on, I just reme mber that from my vi ew 
they look like real Europ
ean -- European couple. 
 

Q: And they were nice to you? 

 

A: They was nice to me . They was very nice to 
me . They was very nice to me, but what -- as 
I said what happened, and when -- the second 
time when Mom ca me  to -- to -- to pick up 
me , so it was a big difference in me  now b
ecause they start to do something with me. 
Some thing happened inside me  that I stopped ea
ting, and they said that, ﬁHe doesn™t want 
to eat, I don™t know what happened to him, 
he -- he usually was a good eater, now he 
stops,ﬂ -- like he stopped eat
 [indecipherable] was like a ha
lf left for me  what I was 
before, on the time when Mom ca me to pick up me a second time. 
 

Q: And they didn™t want to give you up? 

 

A: They did not want. They did not want the -- a
nd they try -- well, they
 not bring this case 
to the cour t or something like this, first of al
l, because as I said it was a situation when 
you was on this territor -- terr
itory, you™re guilty. So -- and my mo m, let™s say she got 
like a pr ivileges because  she was a wife for aperson who fight for -- in the army, so for 

that it was better don™t d
eal with it. My mo m said -- but as
 I said, when my mo m said that 
she want me  to stay a little bit longer be-before she will pr
epare for this, they was agree 
with it.  
 

Q: And when was it that you stopped eating?  Th
 -- when she came  the second time and said 
she would come  back for you, or -- 
 

A: No, when the -- when the -- when she ca 
-- said that she will come  back to me . 
 

Q: So then you stopped eating until you were going to be with her? 

 

A: Yeah, yeah, because I start very well -- 
some thing start insi de me , and I start -- 
 

Q: It™s interesting because when you appear to 
be  safe, then you seem to have an emotional 
reaction. 
 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: Do you know?  You didn™t have a reaction before, and now -- 

 

A: Yeah, because before, as I said, it looked 
like I don™t see the changes because well, I was 
safe in this pl ace. It was not this time when
 it was under the -- covered by watermelons -- 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0485  
16 
 
Q: Right. 
 

A: -- it was totally different s
ituation now. And as I said when
 -- when -- when Germans left 
these pl aces, so they start a -- I remember that -- 
well, in -- in my -- in this sheltered life, I 
never got the same  kind of dress, of some th
ing like -- like they [indecipherable] to me , 
because they believe  that now they are sa
fe, they don™t have to do anything, and God 
gave them a child, so this is -- was the situation. 
 

Q: Before your mother came, when it was finally safe -- 

 

A: Uh-huh. 

 

Q: -- were you able to go outside, and were
 you playing with other kids, or you still -- 
 

A: When Ger mans was? 
 
Q: No, when the Germans left. 

 

A: Yeah, when Germans left, I was -- I -- I -- I 
-- I wa -- I pl ayed in -- they had like as their 
property, I don™t know -- 
 

Q: No. 

 

A: -- it was their own or some thing like this, a
nd I -- yes, I played, but mostly I played by 
myself. 
 
Q: Right. 
 

A: It was no -- no kids my age around.  

 

Q: What did you call them? 

 

A: Thesepeople? 

 

Q: Yeah. 

 

A: I called them Mom and Dad. 

 

Q: MomandDad? 

 

A: Yeah, Mom and Dad. 

 

Q: Didyou? 

 

A: Yeah. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0485  
17 
 
Q: Did you do that from the beginning, or did they 
say this was just safer, to do it that way? 
 
A: Well, it™s almost -- it™s almost from t he 
beginning because when she explained me that I 
have to tell them that all -- everyone has to 
know that this is my 
dad, this is my mom.  
This is how I have to call them. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: And I start to do it. 

 

Q: Do you have any idea how your mother actu
ally found you?  It seems al mo st impossible. 
 

A: Well, I -- I ha ve an idea because as I sai
d, it was not so big place. All these villages wa s 
around. 
 

Q: AroundStavropol. 

 

A: Around Stavropol, around -- it was not far aw
ay from this place. So, and you know, when 
the Russians came back, so everyone who was survive around, they try to find as much as 

possible excuses for themself. I don™t know wh
at happened to this woma n who gave me  

to Germans. Maybe -- maybe as a -- she went 
to the prison, and she said where she went, 

okay?  Maybe the peop -- the family, where 
I spent a few nights under the me lon, ma ybe 

they wanted also have some  like [indeciphe
rable] advantages, and sh -- they reported 

some where, because Mom, for the first thing 
where she -- as I said, I -- as I me ntioned 
Voencoma t, so she -- she puts [indecipherable]
 and this way and come  on, they -- it was 
very powerful -- 
 

Q: Isee. 

 

A: -- powerful organization. So they put the 
question to any others places. And as I said, 
they -- they got -- in Russia it was a special
 -- special way to watch on you. So this 10 
buildings assigned to such and such police wo
rker. So he came  and he s a id, ﬁWell, you 
got two. Wh ere you -- where you got this boy?ﬂ 
Like you said, ﬁ Where you got this boy?  
Before war you did not get it, where you got 
it?ﬂ So you had to te
ll them where you got 
it. And they compare all this information, fi
nally she find me . It was not easy, but she 
find me . 
 

Q: She find you. 

 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: Do you know how long it took her?  Five mont
hs, four months, two mont hs?  Do you have 
any idea? 
 

A: It -- about --
 about six months. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0485  
18 
 
Q: Sixmonths. 
 

A: About six months. 

 

Q: And she was sure you were alive? 

 

A: I™msorry? 

 

Q: She was sure you were alive? 

 

A: Yes, becor -- because -- well, she got a hope
 that I am alive. And well, I understand her 
when -- when some one - -  everyone knows 
what happened to this place where --- 
 

Q: Yes. 

 

A: -- I was, but someone ma ybe -- I -- this is -- 
this a very interesti
ng question where she got 
this information from whom?  Who did te
ll her that one guy, and I believe just 
[indecipherable] myself, because no 
one else was able to escape. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: This is -- was like a mi racle, that let™s see,
 this [indecipherable] he went out from this -- 
from this places where they got a guard, and 
they said don™t -- don™t 
let them go. But they 
said, oh this guy can go. He doesn™t need some on
e to take a look on him. And this is how 
it happened.  
 
Q: Does your mother know that you -- that this
 woma n had this German boyfriend and that 
she s -- he just sent you away? 
 
A: Well, she came  and she said, ﬁWhere™s my 
-- where™s my child? ﬂ So she said -- maybe 
she did not tell them that 
it was her bo-boyfriend -- 
 

Q: That [indecipherable] right. 

 

A: -- she said like the German came -- 

 

Q: The German came and took him.  

 

A: -- and he took him. And wh
at I can do? He just came. 
 

Q: And you, of course, never were able to 
find that ma n who saved you. You have no idea 
who he was. 
 

A: No, I don™t -- I don™t know -- I -- I reme mber
 like he looked like, but I don™t know -- not 
his name , not -- 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0485  
19 
 
Q: He wasn™t Jewish? 
 

A: He was not Jewish, no. 

 

Q: He was -- you th -- but you th
ink he was in the partisans? 
 

A: He was he -- he work -- I believe that he to
ld them that he agree work with them, but he 
got a connection with these partisans,
 with -- with underground resistance. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: He got the connection, and the say -- the pri -- 
the story is that the Germans, they was not 
long time in this place ma ybe, this is -- this is why it worked. They did not get a lot time, 

let™s say, to -- you know, t- to be -- they 
still was under this impression to say that 
Russians their bosses, not German. 
 

Q: Uh-huh,uh-huh. 

 

A: So in Ukraine, it was di ff erent st ory, they
 got a lot people that they was not in some  
ways, they did -- was not agree with what wa
s going on. In this place in St avropol it wa s 
a little bit more loyal to the government. So 
that is why -- ma ybe the people they said, 
well we have to do some thing. 
 

Q: Some thing,right. 

 

A: And as I say, they did not got a lot time to
 do something wi -- it was -- was consider safe 
place, and wa s [indecipherable] if some one ca me , like you wa ke up, and you hear 

Germans here. 
 

Q: So where did your mother set up home  the
n, when she left and then she was going to 
come  back for you, where did she go? 
 

A: She in the same -- in the same place where besh -- Beshbagir, she -- she went to this 
Voencomat and they gave her place where she 
ha s to live. And her sist er was with her 
also. And this is three of us, we stay together . And it was time when Germans a little bit 

gave up. And Mom™ s fa mily -- Mom™ s fa mily, with
 her older sister, with her sisters, they 

moved to more safe place in deep Russia, in Kazakhstan.  
 

Q: Mm.  

 

A: So later, when they knew the story, that sh
e survive, blah, blah, blah, so they got her 
permission to come  to Kazakhstan, stay together
 in this family. And the rest the years in 

the war, I was in this Kazakhstan with my Mom.  
 

Q: Kazakhstan. And that™s for about 
another year until the war is over? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0485  
20 
 
A: Yeah, it took us ara -- another year. So, because
 in the week that is 
the end of the war, we

Q: And does your father know where you all are? 

 

A: Yes, my mo m, my -- we ll, it was a like -- 
a system where they send letters. They -- the -- 
it was like P.O. box. 
 

Q: Uh-huh,yes. 

 

A: The address was like P.O. box. 

 

Q: Yes. 

 

A: And she send the letter, and it was very inte
resting letter, was -- it™s for -- it was like 
triangle, they did not have envelopes. So they
 made it the -- is they write some thing, and 
one page was without writing, so they ma de the 
triangle, and they -- on this triangle they 
put an address where this letter go, and w
ho is the sender. And because it goes to the 
army, you need -- you don™t need
 to put a stamp with it. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: So it was like for fr ee, but it was rush -- 
military time letters. So she save -- I reme mb er 
these letters when they saved them up. 
 

Q: So you knew that your father was alive? 
 
A: Yeah, we knew that our fa ther was alive. 

 

Q: A-And the brothers. 

 

A: And his brothers. 

 

Q: And-- 

 

A: We did not know about his brothers. 

 

Q: Okay. 

 

A: We knew it when the war was over. Bu
t we knew that our father was alive. 

 

Q: And how wa s it in Kazakhstan, was that difficult? 

 

A: Well, in Kazakhstan it wa s not -- not bad. 
We  got [indecipherable]
 life in Kazakhstan, 
because my mother™s ol d sister, she was ma
rried for a guy who was let -- don™t go to the 
army. He got some  health problem before the war. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0485  
21 
 
 
Q: Right. 

 

A: So they let him stay. And he worked in a pl
ace that gave us some  
privileges and food. He 
was close to the meat. 
 

Q: Aha. 

 

A: His position was close to the meat. 

 

Q: Right. 

 

A: He was some kind of boss in 
the -- they got a special -- a sp
ecial business in Russia, when 
they have to prepare me at -- 
how prepare, they have to buy some thing, this animals, cow 
or some -- something, and make -- put them 
somewhere to k -- to kill them and have 
meat. So he wa -- he was in this kind of bus
iness. It was not his business, but he was 
close to the meat. So -- and because he wa
s close to the meat, so we got the la -- 
 

Q: So you were close to the meat. 

 

A: We was close, we got -- we got some  meat also. 

 

Q: Right.

ob as a bookkeeper, and as I said, it was -- this -- this 
Voencomat, they put an order to help, to suppor
t all those families, to give them jobs, to 
take care about them. So that is welse -- 
that how we survive, well it was -- you know 
what, if you take a look actually, what was 
-- it wa s not, but if you compar e what other 
people got, we got not -- not bad. 
 

Q: Notbad. 

 

A: We got not bad. 

 

Q: Were you -- when you were in Kazakhstan, were
 you able to fi nally play with other kids? 
 

A: Yeah. And I was -- 

 

Q: So that must have ma de a big difference to you. 

 

A: -- yeah, it was very funny story. Wh en -- when
 I -- in -- the way how 
they check if this, 
let™s say cow is good for them, for a meat, or if 
it™s -- I don™t know, th
ey -- they put their 
hands some thing behind the -- the tail, you know, th
e tail of the -- so they
 -- they touch it, 
and they know what does it mean for them
, it™s good or not. I don™t know why. So -- and 
I saw how they did it, so I went once, andI did it by myself. And the cow, by her feet, 

she put me  here in the stomach, and I --

Q: And you rode a horse? 

 

A: I rode -- yeah, I rode a horse. And it 
was -- and we played w
ith all these people. 
 

Q: So it wasn™t so bad? 

 

A: Well no, it was not so bad. 

 

Q: Now that you -- it was [indecipherable] 

 

A: It was much, much better than a ghetto. 

 

Q: Than a ghetto, yes. 

 

A: Yeah, it was much better. 

 

Q: Was it worse than what you had with this Po
lish -- I me an, with th
is Ukrainian fami ly? 
 

A: It was like a Polish family. Well, it wasn™t

never seen a German. But I rememb er how it lo
oked like and how to go to drive in this 
general™s motorcycle, and things like this, a

time.

A: It was on -- you know, the time was difficult 
to ma ke sure that your father will come  
alive -- 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: -- or -- and when the war will be over.  

 

Q: Did you meet your father 
again in Kazakhstan, or  not? 
 

A: No, no, no, for -- we me  -- we meet my father
 -- my father came  maybe home half a year 
or s -- eight months later,
 when the war is over. 
 

Q: Over. 

 

A: Because from this front he 
was sent to far, far west. Fr
ont is close to Japan. Because 
General Noye, Japan will fight this. And it was th
e idea to ba -- to br ing their ar my to this 
place also. 
 
Q: Right,right 
 

A: So he came back from this place, and we cam
e to this -- we came  to this Dnepropetrovsk, 
the place where we left before. But our house 
-- house where we liv
e, was destroyed. And 
our -- no one promise him some thing else with 
the place we had to li

his parent s, my grandparents, they came  to 
ki -- they was also in Kazakhstan during the 

war, in different pl ace. A-And they came to Kiev. And my grandfather, he  was a 

carpenter, and h -- they got some thing like a ga
rage or some thing like this, and from t his 
garage, they built a -- an apartmen
t building. Not building, apartment. 
 

Q: Rea -- really? 

 

A: It was apartment with a basement, with a -- 
with -- and it was very, 
very, very, very ni -- 
it was not bad, according to the Russian standa
rds, because it was a separate apartment. 
After the war they di d not -- most people they 
did not have a separate apartment, they got 
a common restroom, a common shower, a common kitchen, and six, seven fa milies, they 

shared. 
 

Q: Right.

A: And we got, because my grandfather build 
it by hi s hands, so it was some thing -- it was a 
place that no one believes that it could be 
place for -- for living, but he managed to ma ke 
it. And it was two small rooms, two small r
ooms , and -- but my grandmom said, ﬁWe ll, 
bring your fa mily here.ﬂ And -- but I stay 
with my mo m™ s relatives in Dnepropetrovsk 
another year. 
 
Q: Mm-h m.

Q: Really? 

 
A: Yeah, I got some  -- well, it was no food, a

survived because no me dication, no food. So -- but -- and my mo m, she -- she drive from 
Kiev to Dnepropetrovsk and back, because Father
 was in Dnepropetrovsk, he tried to -- in 
Kiev he tried to find a job and start some thi
ng to do. And this -- but 
when I came to -- to 
the -- to Kiev, so my mom went to the school
 and said, ﬁHe almost finished the first 
class.ﬂ So she gave me  a test, then says, ﬁOka
y, he can go to the second.ﬂ So I went to the 
second grade. 
 

Q: What disease -- what did you get 
sick from, do you know?  Wh at was it? 
 

A: No, no, it was -- what the -- how they 
call it?  Li ke pneumoni a, some thing like 
pneumonia. 
 

Q: Pneumonia,really? 

 

A: Yeah, pneumonia, and after war it was very di

25 
 
A: So -- and as I said I was li

was a big problem. But I survived. 
 
Q: Yousurvived. 

 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: As you kept doing. 

 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: So when you went to Kiev -- 

 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: -- that ™s when life really started agai n. 

 

A: Well where when I start -- when I st ayed the 
next 10 years, because in Kiev, well, i-it was 
my -- the st or y was that the class wh
ere I went, it was only Jewish people. 
 

Q: Really? 

 

A: Really. And it was happen, 
I don™t know how. Maybe a lo
t people was around. When I 
start it was not, it was most go -- mo-most Russian people, Ukrainian people. And later 

they change some thing because the -- one
 school was overcrowd, they open a new 

school, and th -- no one knew about the school
, it was school without name , so everyone 
who has choice to put you in better school, th
ey did not go to this 
school, so the school 
left for -- for us. And we got school, we got 
30 people in the class, 22 was Jewish. And a 
lot teachers was also Jewish. So it was up to 
-- up to the years on the ™50 - ™52, and on the 
™52, they -- all the Jewish teachers, they -- 
they put them on -- they pu -- took them a way 
from us. They get -- they [indecipherable] 
 

Q: We re they fired?  

 

A: They fired. All Jewish pe  -- teach
ers they fire, all Jewish teachers. 
 

Q: The 50™s wasn™t good. 

 

A: Fi -- ™50, no, ™50 was not good. But what Claudi
a said, that she said that she cried when -- 
when Stalin die, and I reme mber that I did not
 cry absolutely, because on this time  I start 
understand what is it about. And there -- what 
was my concern was in this time, it was -- 
it was a tennis -- a tennis 
championship, Ukrainian tennis 
championship, and they gil -- 
they said, ﬁNo, it™s cancelled because  Stalin die.ﬂ And I was very, very upset about it. 

This was what I reme mb er, how I upset that
 Stal in was die -- wa -- die -- and I -- I 
reme mber that I -- I -- al l times that I as
k well, why they put him like -- always like a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0485  
26 
 
God?  Why t hey put him -- this question was al
ways [indecipherable] said, ﬁDon™t ask this 
question. Don™t ask this question.ﬂ 
 
Q: Don™task. 

 

A: And this was a question 
that I actually ask myself. 
 

Q: So when you were little -- 

 

A: I™msorry? 

 

Q: When you were lit
tle, during the war -- 
 

A: In the village? 

 

Q: No -- ye -- yeah, in the village. You were very conscious
 you were Jewish, but you knew 
you shouldn™t say anything. Di -- or when -- or
 let me  ask you this question in -- in a 
different way. When -- 
 

A: Yeah? 

 

Q: -- when did you become  conscious of 
being Jewish, and want to identify -- 
 

A: Actually it was in Kiev, when -- when I s --
 came to the second -- to
 the second grade, so 
I understand actually that I am Jewish, and 
when I take a look what -- how my -- my 
grandmother, because she [indecipherable] had Judaism all her life. And because even 
that my father did not want it, and she sa
id, ﬁOkay, you can live how you want to do it, 
and I will manage how I can want to do it.ﬂ 
 
Q: Right. 

 

A: So -- and my grandfather, he said, ﬁWell,
 I™m working with Jew -- with Russian, with 
Ukrainian, I not -- I™m not goi
ng to keep separate. And if you want, I can do what you 

want. It™s holiday -- it™s holiday. Shabbas is Shab
bas, it™s -- you want to -- to buy a -- and 

go to the [indecipherable] to hear discussi
on [indecipherable] okay you can do it, I will 
do it.ﬂ But there was story that like a survivor 
situation, that in two rooms , and with one 
kitchen, it wa s my mom™ s kitchen, without anyt
hing kosher. It was my grandmom kitch -- 
kitch -- part. In Mom refrigerator is a kosher. 
 

Q: So the refrigerator was kosher, or part of it was kosher? 

 

A: No, no, no, it™s part of them.  

 

Q: I see, so -- 

 

A: One shelf, and another shelf. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0485  
27 
 
 
Q: -- one shel f is -- I see. 

 

A: This is --  this -- 

 

Q: And so what did you identify with, your pare
nts or your grandparents?
 Your grandfather, 
your grandmother? 
 

A: My nifi -- 

 

Q: Did you want to be kosher, 
and to be religious, or no? 

 

A: No, to be honest with you, I did not want be
 re -- I actually, I ver
y, very honor what my 
grandmoth -- mo m do, I know h -- how she r
eads books, how she ma kes prayers. But 

actually, I -- I -- I did no
t believe that it would be part of my l i fe -- 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: -- or some thing like this. We  -- we got Jewish 
friends with all Jewish -- like life, it me ans 
not Jewish culture life. We got all the 
friends around that wa s Jewish, girls, boys. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: We did not deal with not Jewish people. Th
ey s -- they st ay now, class like  -- like 
separate. 
 
Q: And you say separate. 
 

A: And we said separate
, but we did not fight. 
 

Q: So what was ma king you Jewish? 

 

A: I™msorry? 

 

Q: What was Jewish about you? 

 

A: What was Jewish about me ?  

 

Q: Yeah. 

 

A: What was Jewish about me , b
ecause I know just I am Jewish. 

 

Q: That you were Jewish. 

 

A: And I know that m -- the fir -- well -- bay 
-- because when -- when 
you said -- in Russia 
when you call, you said your first name , your father™s name  -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0485  
28 
 
 
Q: Yeah. 

 

A: -- and your last name . 

 

Q: Right. 

 

A: So because my father™s name  was Leib, so 
I was Leibovich, so is no question about that I 
was a Jewish. 
 

Q: Right,right. 

 

A: So -- and I -- that is what I was. 

 

Q: But you were not identifying 
religiously as a Jew, right? 
 

A: No, I did not.  

 

Q: And f -- 

 

A: I helped my grandmom t o ma ke ma tzoh, some ti mes I help her to go to synagogue. 

 

Q: Right. 

 

A: You know, to -- to do some thi
ng what she want me  to do. 
 
Q: Right,right. 
 

A: But is not because I wanted 
to keep this religious life. 
 

Q: Right. Did you think of yourself as a Ukrainia
n Jew, or a Russian Jew,
 or just Jewish?  Do 
you understand, because as an amer -- 
 

A: Maybe just Jewish. 

 

Q: -- as a -- 

 

A: Maybe just Jewish. I did not seem -- 

 

Q: JustJewish,uh-huh. 

 

A: -- later -- later, when I si -- when I become
 older, when we me t some  Jewish people from 
different parts, from Russia, from M oscow
, from Saint Petersburg, we understand this, 
we are different. And we are ti -- we are tota
lly different because the people from -- they 
have different philosophy, and different way 
to behave themself. And ma ybe different 
way to survive, I don™t know. To -- because th
ey -- we -- sometimes for us, to be honest 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0485  
29 
 
with you, to understand people, was easy to 
understand Ukrainian people from Ukraine, 
than Jewish people from Russia. 
 
Q: Right,right. 

 

A: And to find out the common -- the common poi
nt or -- we -- we 
better understand them, 
the bi -- the Jewish peop
le from -- from Russia. 
 

Q: Right. Okay, let™s change the tape. 

 

End of Tape #2 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0485

Tape #3 
 
Q: Do you know anything about the family that saved you? 

 

A: No. 

 

Q: Youdon™t? 

 

A: I don™t know anything. 

 

Q: You don™t know their name ?  

 

A: I don™t know the name , I don™t know anything. I don™t know because as I said, well, it 
was like -- it was not -- it was -- the be -- 
the [indecipherable] was don™t go some where 
and tell them that we was under Germans, b
ecause it can, as I said, like be a stain on your 
-- in your personal -- so --
 and my mo m never [indecipherable] and I don™t know 
anything about them. I™m very sorry about that. 
 

Q: Yeah. Even though your father was in the army -- 

 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: -- it still would be a problem.  

 

A: It would still be a problem, 
yeah, it still will be a problem. 

 
Q: Were you ever sympathetic to the Communists? 
 

A: Well I -- I was never sympathetic to them
, because the -- the question is that their 
promise was totally not what they actually di
d the people. Let™s say 
they said that you 
have right for speech, you have freedom -- I 
don™t know, a lot of freed
om actually, when 
it come s to realize these rights, you don™t have
 them. So -- and the 
question is, they did 
not left anything for you, let™s say, to think abou
t, or to tell them let™s -- let™s to improve 
some thing, let™s do some thing in different ways. So -- 
 

Q: And at what -- what age did you become
 -- did you realize th
is?  At a young age? 
 

A: Yeah, I realize it at -- at 
very young age, and the question wa
s just what you have to do, 
you have to start to be like 
[indecipherable] resistant to th
is, or you have to find some  
way -- ways how to in future support your fa
mily, and things like
 this, and do anything 
against, let™s say, your family. So that is why 
you stay, that™s it. But 
what -- what -- about 
criticism, what is doing,
 the governme nt, what they doing wrong, it was always in 
conversation in our house. So that is why wh
en I -- when we -- when I got ma rried, and 
we went -- got a son, so we decided that our 
son™s life could not be here, because he grow 
up in the situations that he 
cannot -- he cannot accept it. And 
well, when we got ma rried -
- so my wi fe, she -- much earlier than me  she 
realized that for us is no room here, and we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0485  
31 
 
have to leave this country and find some th
ing else. And -- well, why I wa s not very 
support -- why I did not support where he
 decided, because I said, ﬁListen, 
[indecipherable] what we have now because
 I am working with a com -- with the 
company that they can tell me there are no se
crets, we will be -- we will stuck between 
leave this one and don™t have anything else, and 
just don™t let us go. So this is why I let -- 
I cannot do it right now.ﬂ 
 
Q: So you were working for a --  

 

A: We ll, I worked -- 

 

Q: You were -- you were working with some
 other company so that you knew governme nt 
secrets?  
 

A: Well, they said yes, but the branch 
where I was, I did not
 have any secrets. 
 

Q: Uh-huh. 

 

A: And later -- later, when they
 decided, when they open a litt
le bit mi nd, they let leave the 
country people who really knew mu ch more 
secrets, and they did not said that you 
cannot. This is -- was just a plan, was a gove
rnme nt plan, the plan with the governme nt 
level. Because as I said, it™s for the hi stor
y no one can explain that when they decided 
that they would like -- 
they let Jewish people to leave th
e country, they have to found an 
excuse, why Jewish?  Wh y they don™t let Russian -- 
 

Q: Right. 
 
A: -- or Ukrainian, or some one else. So they 
ma ke up that they g -- they support the fa -- 
united family, as a -- 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: -- you know, the family was -- and it was licen
ned. They put a paper there, they mi ss her 
[indecipherable], they have not see her fr
om the year 1930 -- 1913, they never know her, 
they nev -- ni -- like next time they m-ma  -- 
ma ke their decision a different way, they said 
all sister is not a relative, some thing else is
 not a relative. And as 
a -- as -- as you know it 
was situation when they -- the way how they explain to the rest of the people that  they 

want leave, let them go, because this is to Is
rael. Jewish people, they unite with some one. 

This is why old people that they won™t -- don™
t like them, so they -- officially they put 
some  documents, and they let them go to Israel. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: It was like -- I think it™s -- even Solzhenitsyn 
they sent it like this, 
sent him to Israel in 
their time. But -- and that is why ma ybe -- ma
ybe, if I decided that we have to do it, 
maybe I -- we got this -- I am not sure they
 will let us go, but I w
ill -- I spent about 18 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0485  
32 
 
years on this factory -- on this enterprise, a
nd -- because from this enterprise when -- wh-
when we -- they did not even take your doc
uments when they see where you worked. It 
was none, but it was excuse for them. So when
 I left it on the next month, I got another 
enterprise. It is no with military connection, so
 we -- we start over from this point . And -- 

bu -- it was the year 1979, and we believe th
at because it was like Olympic game  in 
Moscow, maybe they -- they a little bit open 
the door, and maybe we will be lucky to go 
through this door. And well, th
ey said no. They said no, no, no, no, no. Some  people they 
ma naged, I don™t know how they gave under table money to some one, they -- everything 

was corrupt, so ma ybe they find the way. But 
we did not -- we was unable to do it. But 
what we said, so it was like a legal situat
ion, was you can do like you are on the level, not 
-- not fighting. Cause the governme nt, every si
x months you can to send documents that 
you apply -- that you did not change your
 mi nd, you still apply. And they send you a 
postcard they know. Th -- they did -- the -- a 
division of visas permission, they said you 
cannot go, no, your -- your request is denied, you
r request is denied. And it -- as I said, it 
was when we start -- our problem wa s that wh
en we start first time to do it, our son was 
about two year old. No, not tw
o -- yeah, two year old when we start first time there. 
When he went to the final stage, he almost fi
nish college, and even in this situation, when 
they play game s, a open society, blah, bla
h, blah, they did unbelieva ble thing because 
they played game s and s a id, you know, mo
m can go, you cannot go. Later they said you 
can go but your son cannot go. And in this time , the chief -- the chief of this department, 

he gave interview to some  foreign newspape
rs and he said, ﬁEveryone who want go, we 
let them go. We don™t keep anyone. There™s no on
e want to go.ﬂ And I came  to hi m, t o 
his office with this newspaper, and I said, 
ﬁLet me ask you a que,ﬂ -- it -- in Moscow his 
was very, very, very hi -- high level g
uy, and it™s -- you know, you never know what 
happen to you when you come  back from this 
-- from this office, because he was very 
powerful. So I came to him with this newspaper, I said, ﬁMay I ask you a question 
please? Wha t  does it means?  This is an inte
rview that you gave to this reporter. He did 
not understand you right?  Or it™s a -- a -- a mi st
ake in newspaper? ﬂ And he said to me, 
ﬁNo,ﬂ he said, ﬁhe understand me  right, but we
 make a decision, not he.ﬂ And he said, 
ﬁYour son, we cannot let your son go.ﬂ And itwas a sp-specific system in -- in Russia 
that everyone -- every man, he has a gi -- duty
 to serve three years in the military. After 
military it™s -- besi des there™s a -- the life in 
the military, it™s more
 than in prison. But 
after military they said to you, you cannot 
go because you know secrets, you was in 
military. And no one knows what kind of s
ecrets and how long it lasts to keep you 

because you was in military. And my  son said to
 me , ﬁListen, I better di e than I go to this 

military.ﬂ And with these words, with understanding this, we  have to go to this guy a few 

times, it was very, very difficult. And finally, 
as I said, when we were -- when the wind 
was a little bit warmer, and they let him go, and 
later we left, and in 
Italy, when he came  
to Italy, he decided he would like to help young 
Jewish kids to go to Judaism. So he got a 
[indecipherable] like this, he lis
tened to -- they got like -- a 
rabbi came to Italy, and they 
tried to introduce to the culture, to the tr
adition the ju -- Judaism. And everyone was on 
the beach because it was months, we are 
not working, you got food, and they ma ke a 
decision when -- when sk -- they scheduled 
to bring you to United States, and he was 
busy with kids, wi -- wi -- because he said th
at this is what he has to do. And when we 
came here, so very soon he said that we don™t -- 
we -- we not the right life -- the right life, 
this is a philosophy. And he changed his life, he become  religion. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0485  
33 
 
 
Q: Religious person, yeah. 

 

A: Veryreligious. 

 

Q: So you, even though you tried -- you started la
ter, really for almost 20 years you were 
trying to leave -- 
 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: -- or thinki ng that -- so is it --  must be
 very difficult to live under those circumstances. 

 

A: Yes, yes, because as I said, they -- it is
 become a common -- let™s say what, like refusniks 
-- refusniks, except the pe rson whom they refuse
 give a permi ssion to 
leave. So -- and as 
I said, diff -- different pe -- di
fferent category of people, they
 -- or by their belief or by 
some circumstances, they did i -- they take 
different actions to th
is, you know, they got 
some  of them, they -- every month they go -- 
went to demonstration, and to the Moscow, 
or to foreign people. Most -- a lot of them, th
ey put them in prison, they -- they ma ke up -
- a lot guilt about this, like 
rape, like drugs, like things lik
e this. But we was like on the 
level that they said okay, you can -- you can 
-- every six months you can just send us a 
request, and we will refuse. But it was a -- a -- 
a mark that you are -- belong also to this 
categor y.  
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: And -- I don™t -- they -- every be -- ma
ybe, I don™t know, mont h or two mo nths we got 
some one from the police, or from the  KGB, he
 was -- had a police uniform. And he s a id -
- he ma ke up a -- a -- any kind of excuse to 
come  to check what we are doing, run, or -- 
or [indecipherable] like this. And -- and he re
ported from our phone, that , ﬁI™m here now 
checking this fa mily, everything looks -- looks not bad.ﬂ And once time he came  to us 

and he said -- I said, ﬁWhy did you come  to 
me ? ﬂ  He said, ﬁWell, we got a letter that 
your neighbor is drunk.ﬂ I said, ﬁOkay, why you di
d not go to this me mbe r
 -- to this -- my 
neighbor?  He  drunk, go to his apartment, 
why you came to me?ﬂ ﬁNo, I would like to 
know if you know some thing about it.ﬂ I sai
d, ﬁNo, I don™t know anything about it.ﬂ 
ﬁOkay, just write that you don™
t know about it.ﬂ I said, ﬁLook, how it help you?  What is 
the reason? ﬂ But they mi  -- ma ke up ever
ything, and the problem was when I -- my 
second job when I -- it was not a manager pos
ition, but some times I have taught them the 
director™s meetings, because I was in charge 
for supplies, some  i mportant things to the 
factory. And it was -- some ti me s is not your 
fault but you cannot ma nage it because it™s -- 
it was like a circle. To have 
the supplies you have to give
 them some thing that you are 
unable to give them, some  material and you don™t 
have it. And the -- the director said to -

- on this meeting, listen, if I will not have 
these supplies, I will 
call KGB that you di d it 
on purpose, you don™t want me  to do this produ
ction and this one ki -- the governme nt 
want me to do. And I believe they will make
 you bah bah bah, like this. And that every 
day was like this, and especially you can 
understand when our son was in Moscow, and 
when we still try to let him go, one days we cam
e  to -- to this chief, this departme nt, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0485  
34 
 
we ask him, ﬁLook, what is your logical?  Is -- 
from such and such here, we  tried to go all 
together. So now what -- how is the family 
united?  If you said -- you advise them to go 
and bring him invitation, later he will have
 relatives here, and 
we -- he will have 
permission, what is the [indecipherable]?  What is
 the -- what is the logic?ﬂ And he said to 
me , ﬁListen, the students are very patriotic pe
ople, so we cannot guarant ee he will be sa fe 
in ma  -- in Moscow.ﬂ This is -- was the life. 
 

Q: When -- when you switched jobs, you left your job? 

 

A: Uh-huh. 

 

Q: And they knew that you are refusnik. Some body knew. 

 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: The next job you had you were not earning 
as much money a s you were the first time, 
right? 
 

A: Yeah, I got ma ybe half what I got before
. And the -- the guy w
ho interview me  said, 
ﬁListen, when you move from this place to our place, it means you keep in mi nd 

some thing. Tell me  right away. You know, ifyou go some where, I will have a problem 

with the -- it will be pr oblem for me . So in or
der to give you pe rmission or not, I have to 
know -- tell me  right away what you going to do.
ﬂ And I said to him, ﬁ We ll, I am telling 
you right -- right away that I di
d not change my mi nd, but because they said that I cannot 

leave country because I used to work on th
is military, I don™t know how long they will 
keep me  here. Do you know what will ha ppen to you in three years?  You don™t know.ﬂ 
So -- and you don™t know what people it™s ar ound in your departme nt, you know wha t  in 
their mi nd. They can make a decision tomorrow. 
So this job was not very, very -- let™s 
say presti --  with a prestige, with a lot mone
y, and it was difficult, if need some special 
skills, and some one recommend me
 to this job. So he said ok
ay. He -- he closed his eyes. 
[indecipherable] did that because when you 
go from the place where I work bef-before, 

this place was famous place, with a li -- bene
fits, with a lot opport
unities for -- just for 
benefits, not about salary, but benefits was 
really much higher than any other company 
have. So they understand what you keep in mi nd, or you fired because you did some thing 

wrong, against them, and you just ma nage they --
 they don™t put that they fire, or not. In 
United States when you find the -- try to geta job you put your resumé . In Russia you got 

a -- like a certificate,
 your certificate. Every 
job that you go they put 
a seal here, and they 
put the reason why you left this job. So -- a
nd if they put the reason that they fire you 
because you are bad worker, or you late, or 
you dr unk, or something like this, so later on 
it™ll na -- no one when -- will take you, and 
this i -- was the requirement, you have to 

show them t he certificate. Without 
this certificate, no one talk to you. 
 

Q: So what was on your certificate 
when you left this other place? 
 

A: Nothing, that I decide by
 myself, and that is it. 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0485  
35 
 
Q: Nothing. And were you doing mechanical engi
neering at this place
? That™s what you 
studied in college. 
 
A: It was close, it was -- it was -- 

 

Q: Close? 

 

A: -- it was a mechanical engineering field. I 
have to explain my boss in my c o mpany why I 
decided to leave. So I cannot 
tell -- I could not tell him th
at I want to go to abroad -- 
 

Q: No,no. 

 

A: -- I just tell him that I ha
ve relatives, and -- and we  in c
ontact with them in the United 
States. So I gave then infor mation that he 
knows all -- or -- or -- if
 not he, but special 
departme nt knows it already. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: And that is why I said I 
would like to leave this place, 
and I will go. And he said, ﬁDon™t 
worry, stay, I will ma nage it.ﬂ He sa id, ﬁA 
couple bottle with vodka, everything will be  
okay, don™t worry.ﬂ Because my position in my previous job, it was not very, very big 

level, but I was like assistant to our big 
boss. He was a chief in quality control 
production, and it was a factory about 5,000 peop
le. And my j ob was like statistical job, 
to prepare him for the meetings, for -- for re
ports, for some thing like this. So he was very 
comfortable with me  because I tell him what
 his action, how this [indecipherable] should 
be, what he has to me ntion. And he doesn™t -- 
he did not want me  actually, to leave. He 
did not want me  to leave. A
nd he said well, one -- one Jew -- one Jew, he can keep one 
Jew. I was just one, no one else. It wa s lik
e under the percentage. And but this what -- 
how I explain him, I said, ﬁ Well, I am going to
 leave.ﬂ He said, ﬁOh, stay with us, blah, 
blah, blah.ﬂ I said no, because from this enterprise, I never leave. 
 

Q: You never go, yeah. 

 

A: So I left, and I came to another one and th
ey [indecipherable] they remi nd me  very often 
where I come from, and what I keep in mi nd, because they knew that my papers every 

time, when I -- and the last time -- not -- it was not last  time, before this -- before this 

time, I fill out the papers again, and -- and th
e di rector of this, he was a Jewish guy, and -- 
but he got a Russian name , he -- by documents he was Russian. So he said to me , ﬁListen, 

because you put this documents that you want in U.S., I have to transfer you from this 

engineering job to ship -- to like ship
ping receiving, some thing like load and loud 
[indecipherable]or some thing.ﬂ I said, ﬁ Well 
if you feel that it™s
 constitution, you can do 
it. I™m not going to put you any -- any request 
about this.ﬂ Well, and he decided okay, let 
him stay like this. And this -- well, I stay like 
this. But as I said, all 
pe -- a lot people who 
are brought for fight, who f -- f -- to give us th
is opportunity, they help because this one -
- one -- wa -- one [indecipherable] did not come
 back to self. So -- 
well, [indecipherable] 
Gorbachov came, and he got an idea that let™
s say let™s have better relationship with -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0485  
36 
 
with the west , with some thing el se, but all pe
ople who fight hard, work hard to bring this 
day, to let us go, they -- peop -- we reme mber [indecipherable] 
 
Q: Do you think that a lot of people who were in
 the Soviet Union would have left if they 
had the chance, whether they 
were Jewish or not Jewish? 

 
A: Yeah, I s -- I seeing personally, 
if they -- they was not so stup
id, if they decided what is 
the deal. If they want to go, let them go, 
letthem go. What --wh
at happened?  Everyone 
who want go, let them go. A lot people ma y be
 going to do so, but I th
ink that™s not -- a 
lot people -- 
 

Q: Would have stayed. 

 

A: -- will later -- will go ba ck. Why?  Because, 
you know, it™s -- to grow up in this society, 
and find your place in new society, is not easy -- 
 

Q: Is very -- yeah. 

 

A: -- it™s very hard. It™s totally different, 
you have to f -- you have to know exactly what you 
want to do, and why you leave th
is country. If you would like 
to leave this country just 
because you can have here [indecipherable] jeans, or I don™t know, or cheese every day, 

or some thing like this, ve ry soon ma ybe you mi s s it, and you like to go ba ck, because you 

reme mber some  not bad things in your 
previous life, some things. Departme nt -- 
apartment, education syst em, something like 
this. But the problem was th -- the -- that 
they did not let them go, and the problem was tr
ue because they did not o -- they di -did 
not honor your right to exerci
se your roots, you religion. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: And this is the problem. And what I want fo
r -- what I just -- I don™t know, if you goes to 
the -- I -- I want just me ntion one thing, that
 when I came here, so my first job was also 
we have to find some thing to live, so I star
t to working for shipping receiving. And in the 
-- in the st ore -- in store, is
 it -- they sell some equipment 
for the kitchen. And my first 
boss -- fir -- fir -- first supervisor  -- wa -- was first supervisor, I™m sorry, he was 

American African guy, who grow up in tradit
ion with people who re
me mber -- in this 
time the mo veme nt start in 60™s, and you know -- 
 

Q: In civil rights. 

 

A: -- civil rights, and he reme mb
ered his family wa s very, very
 in -- in this move me nt. And 
he was actually this very gi
ft -- gifted guy. He was smart, he listened, he wa s li -- good 
very listener and -- and I said, ﬁI would 
like to know actually, when you go to school, 
these people -- people in your c
ountry, they -- they know wha t is the advantage to live in 
America. Why people from around the world actually
 try -- want to come
 to here and stay 
here? ﬂ  He said, ﬁNo, no one -- I don™t know, 
I don™t reme mbe r  even one lesson that my 
teacher told me  what is the advantage, wh
at we have here.ﬂ  If you don™t ha ve -- if you 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0485  
37 
 
don™t teach them what is the advant age, so 
-- you know, it™s -- it™s -- is 
not the best things 
to do because they -- they don™t valu
e what they have. This is the -- 
 
Q: So did you tell him?   

 

A: Yeah, I told him, I told him -- well, I told 
him a ver -- very simple story. I said to him -- 
you know, when it -- I reme mber this time when it 
was little bit idea that we had to bring 
American experience to the 
Russian. It was some governme nt decision, it was time . In 
this time  -- and I reme mb er that one -- once -- one -- he was the guy, his was 

[indecipherable] that he came from very ri
ch sugar production fa mily before revolution 
[indecipherable] was here. So he came to -- a
nd they invite him to introduce some  people 
[indecipherable] to the American life, to the st
yle, and he said, ﬁIf you will tell American 
that,ﬂ -- Russian has this word
 like [indecipherable] or presid
ent, they call it pr epeeska. 
Oh stop, forgot about [indecipherable] that
 your lifestyle is good, because American 
cannot understand what is it. It™s like [indeciphe
rable] even accept it. So -- and I expl ain 
to him what -- what we got, and we -- how 
-- what we -- wh-what is the salary, what you 
can do, and how it works, and what does it mean the freedom, and what does it mean the 

speech and everythi ng. And so he understand that this is -- 
 

Q: [indecipherable] right. So you never 
regretted comi ng to the United States? 
 

A: Never. 

 

Q: Never. 

 

A: Ne -- thanks God. 
 
Q: You love being here. 

 

A: Yes, I love being there, I love this opport
unity that everyone has, and the most advantage 
when you [indecipherable] the -- the [ind
ecipherable] of the advantage when you go 
some where, and -- and when you -- when you ha
ve an American passport, how it looks 
like. And the [indecipherable] 
 

Q: Have you ever been back? 

 

A: No, we never went to -- to Russia. 

 

Q: And you don™t want to go [indecipherable]? 

 

A: We went some where, in another country 
for vacation. I do -- I ca
nnot -- I cannot go back. 
I cannot go back. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0485  
38 
 
A: I reme mber that what they did to -- you 
know, when you worked all your life, finally 
when they give you permission, so -- they put 
so restriction you ca
nnot take your -- what 
belong to you. And they put limits, let™s say, 
this picture?  No, you 
cannot take it with 
you. This book you cannot take with you. Even this
 piece of jewelry, that you work hard, 
I don™t know, to get it, no, you cannot get it wi
th you. And for all what they give you, 
they said they give us all this money th
at you have, and give 1
50 dollars and go. What 
country else can do it to the people?  You
™re working, working, working, working. All 
your life you save your pennies, and later 
when you decided to go, you cannot get it -- 
 
Q: Youcan™t. 

 

A: -- and it™s yours. 

 

Q: Well, I want to thank you very much for talking about -- 

 

A: Thank you very much for inviting us, and actua
lly I™m very thankful that my story ma kes 
sense for you and I feel that I have like ob
ligation to take a [i ndecipherabl e] this pl ace, 
like Beshbagir, like Zhme rinko has to be mo
re -- more [indecipherable] museum, and I 
will do my best to help you with it. 
 

Q: Good. Thank you very much.  

 

A: You™re welco me.
