A: Well, there was no more school then. They 
thro w us out of scho
ol and th ey made a

Q: When  did he go?
 
A: November 10, 1938. He got arrested. He
 went to Dachau and we -- everybody was 
trying to  leave the country in those days. My 
father had some tickets  for Shanghai, China, 
but we couldn't go through with
 it. And then he joined 
the kibbutz. He came -- I 
remember exactly. He came -- Nove
mb er the 10th he got arrested.
 
Q: This is your brother?
 
A: Yeah. And my  father got him out by Marc
h the 28th, 1939.And he was staying nine 
days in the kibbutz when he came back. He 
didn't t alk to anybody because he was scared.
 

Q: A kibbutz in Vienna?
 
A: In Vienna, yeah. And after nine days, Ma
rch the 9th, 1939, he left for Sweden. And 
since then he is always in Sweden.
 
Q: I see. D o  you remember any particular vi
olence, physical violence in Novemb er 1938?
 
A: They throw all the people in
 the Jewish stores out. They broke th e windows. They  let 
them wash the sidewalks, and th ey wrote di
rty Jews, and don't buy by the Jews. And they  
had to wash all that off, the Jewish peopl
e. The Jewish people had to wash that.
 
Q: And you as a child
 saw these scenes?
 
A: I saw all this, yeah. I even saw Hitler on
ce, too. He was standing in a balcony in 
Vienna in Hotel Imperial, that's o n e of th
e biggest hotels, and he was standing in the 
balcony. And I was a little boy, about 13 years old, and I had a pair of shoes, I remember 
exactly, I was going to the cemeter
y to my father out there. A
nd if I wouldn't have put my  
hand up he would have kille
d me. So I was yelling, "Heil, Hitler." And I wished I 
wouldn't have been th ere.
 I would have been dead.
 
Q: This was early 1939?
 
A: That was '39.
 
Q: Uh-huh. Uh-h uh. You said you saw all th
is violence being done. Do you rememb er 
how you felt as a child? Was it very frightening?
 
A: I felt very bad. Very, very bad. 
It was frightening, yes, definitely.
 
Q: Did you talk this over with your parents?
 
A: Not much, no, I didn't.
 
Q: Umm-hmm. Okay. So then  you started work
ing with your father as a grave digger?
 
A: Grave digger. I did other jobs, too. I was 
work ing for construction co mp anies, digging 
for the lines for pipelines.  
I worked in -- (spoke in Germ
an) I don't know how I can say 
that. It is n o t easy for me to translate this.
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: I was forced labor in one way with very, very small pay. I got paid, but very, very 

small pay.
 
Q: You were still living at home with your family?
 
A: Well, we were living four families in one apartment.
 
Q: Did you have to move out of your ap artment?
 

A: Oh, yes, we lost it right away. We had to
 move from one ap artment and th ey put four 
families in there. And that 
was in the Tenth District, an d 
then we had to move to the 
Second District. And then we were
 three families in one apartment.
 
Q: Were there other children with you?
 
A: No, I don't -- I don 't remember. I don 't remember.
 
Q: Did you have to wear a star?
 
A: Oh, yes. Oh, yes.
 
Q: When  did you get your star?
 
A: After November, I think it was.After 10 November was it.
 
Q: Did it bother you to wear the star?
 
A: It bothered me, yes. Yes, it did in on
e way. Because everybody was pointing their 
finger at the Jew. You can't sit on bench. C
ity bench you couldn't 
sit because you were 
marked verboten , you were not allowed to sit 
on th e bench. You have to go in  the back in  
the street car. You are not allowed to sit dow
n. And you are verboten, you are verboten , 
wherever you want to go is 
the Jews, you can't go in, you can't go in.I mean, that 
bothered me. I was only 13, 14 years old.
 
Q: Were you physically harmed by anybody Œ
 
A: No.
 
Q: -- on the street?
 
A: No, no, not me. I wa
s lucky in that way.
 
Q: And then  --
 
A: I had a little -- a couple fights once or tw
ice, but nothing serious, nothing serious.
 
Q: All right. So you were doing -- you were 
living at home. What was the food situation 
like?
 
A: Food was bad. We didn't have too mu ch  
food. But I worked, oh, 
yeah, I worked in a 
trucking company th en as a helper, a little
 boy, and they carried
 the -- it was a food 
trucking comp any with all food. And to be h
onest now, I could say 
I brought some food 
home from the truck, fish, chees
e, eggs, I brought this home.
 
Q: So, okay, you were doing th es
e jobs. And then what was the next change after that? Or 

what then  happened?
 

A: The next change was 16 I got in a conc
en tration Œ I was actua
lly in the ghetto, 
Theresienstadt. I was 16 years old.
 
Q: So you stayed home and you did wo rk?
 
A: Yeah, because my father was working fo
r the -- for the Israeli K u tsche Command (ph) 
there, and they were (spoke 
in German) I still -- it is hard
 to translate. They were 
protected from the Gestapo, those people. But 
a lot of people went on transport already. 
They were gone. We were s
till there through my 
father, because he was working in the 
cemetery. But finally we had come to turn to us and we went.
 
Q: Tell us about that moment, th at time when they came to you.
 
A:  They came there, they throw us out of th
e apartment, and that's it. I got arrested, I 
went to the Gestapo in ViennA:
 
Q: They came to your house?
 
A: To the house.
 
Q: And everybody was home at the time?
 
A: No, my mother wasn't alive anymore. My
 mo ther passed away. Sh
e had with  -- a heart 
problem with all the excitement, and there wa
s only my father with me. And like I said, 
we went (spoke in German) in the Jewish 
old age home it used to be. That was a camp. 
They  made a camp out of that. And we stayed
 a couple days there and th ey put us in 
trucks. A couple days after they send 
us on the train to Theresienstadt.
 
Q: This was you and your father?
 
A: Me and my father.
 
Q: And a lot of other people.
 
A: Oh, yes. A whole crew, a whole transport.
 I would say at least three or 4,000 people 
on th e train.
 
Q: On a truck?
 
A: No, on the train there.
 
Q: On trucks to the train station?
 
A: Yeah.
 
Q: And then you got on trains
. And when was this, do you --
 
A: That was in June 1943 or '42.
 

Q: You were 16, so it was '42.
 
A: '42.
 
Q: Okay . You said you were 16.
 
A: I was staying in Theresienstadt still.
 
Q: Before we get there, tell me abou
t the train ride to Theresienstadt.
 
A: It was not that bad because we still ha
d our own clothing, we had our suitcases.
 
Q: What kinds of things
 did you take with you?
 
A: Only  -- only the clothing and a little bit food,
 what we had. But otherwise you couldn't  
take nothing with you.
 
Q: And could you stay with your father during the ride?
 
A:  Yes, yes, yes.
 
Q: Did you have seats? Were you sitting?
 
A: Oh, yeah, we were in box cars -- not
 box cars, they were regular deal --
 
Q: Railroad cars, train cars?
 
A: Yeah.
 
Q: And so you sat and took 
a train to Theresienstadt?
 
A: To Theresienstadt.
 
Q: Do you reme mb er what the feeling of 
the other people was like and were they 
frightened ? Did they  have any id ea what was happening?
 
A: We all were frightened. We all were fri
ghtened. Very, very much. We didn't know 
what -- we didn't  know if we were going to
 Theresienstadt. We had no idea wh ere we 
were going. We were just put in th e train and we went.
 
Q: Okay . And th en you a
rrived in Theresienstadt?
 
A: I arrived in Theresienstadt.
 
Q: What happened when 
you got off the train?
 
A: Off the train there was people we know alre
ady. And they put my  fa
ther and me in a -- 
in a stable. It was a barracks. The barracks, 
big old barracks. There were about 60 people 
at least in there in bunk -- b
unk beds. It wasn't a nice side, 
but there was better than some 
of the other ones. Some of them were livin
g in worse. They  were living in  little houses, 

they were living in one or 
the other. So my father star
ted working for the transport 
unloading box cars,
 and I was playing soccer then.
 
Q: You were playing soccer in the camp?
 
A: In Theresienstadt. It was not a camp, it was a kibbutz.
 
Q: In the ghetto?
 
A: And I had to work, too. I had to work to
 put cars -- I can 't re
me mb er wh at k ind  o f 
work I did. Little work
, kitchen work I did do. Gardenin
g I did a little bit. But mostly I 
play soccer. With the socce
r, I played soccer. So I was a little bit better --
 
Q: You were more athletic?
 
A: I was athletic a little bit, yeah, and I had a little bit --
 
Q: You had played so ccer as a child Œ
 
A: Yes.
 
Q: -- before that? I see. Okay
. So then -- then things went
 on until what was the next --
 
A: September '44. Before September they st
art getting transport together. We didn't know 
where they  go. They  send us out of Theresie
nstadt.  And we came on in September '44 
and I think was Yom Kippur ev en that day,
 Yom Kippur arrived, maybe, I don't know. 
Anyway , we were put on box 
cars and sent to Auschwitz.
 
Q: There was a large group of people?
 
A: The whole train. I don't know how many 
people there were on th em, but it was a 
whole train were sent to Au schwitz.
 
Q: How was your health at this point?
 
A: I was young. I was healthy. I was strong. 
So was my father, too. But the thing when  
we got out there, you know, 
Auschwitz, he wore glasses. 
I didn't wear no glasses then, 
and had a beard from the train ride and he 
looked tired.And Mr. Mengele was standing 
there at the train, we had to go in lines, a
nd Dr. Mengele, left and ri
ght. My father went to 
the right, I went to the left. And I said, "This 
is my father. I want to go with him." This 
man, he had a whip  and he wh ip ped me with
 my  bag an d I was running to th e left. So 
from that date on, that was the end of my 
father. I never saw my father again. And I 
found out there was a fire, I think it was a fi
re, yeah, smokestacks. And I said, "What is 
it?" Somebody told me 
that's -- th ey burn the bricks, unt
il I find out -- it was really messy 
and stinky, you know. So what 
it was, it was the cremato rium.
 
Q: When  you were taking the train to there 
from Theresienstadt, were these cattle cars?
 

A: That was cattle cars, yeah.
 
Q: Yeah. Ho w lo ng did it take you to get there?
 
A: I think it was three or four days. I don't rememb er.
 
Q: Did you get any food during that time?
 
A: We had still food on us. But the worst part
 was I was voluntary -- they was looking fo r 
people, I never got the tut (ph). I was only 
stamped like an animal. And I was voluntary 
to Buchenwald. I said 
to my self I wanted to  get out of
 hell, because what was going on 
there, I can 't even say all that. 
I said go away from here. I want
 to get out, just out of here. 
So when  a group of Viennese people, about 
50, we got voluntary to
 Buchenwald. But we 
never came to Buchenwald, we came to Kaufering.
 
Q: Well, now, wait a minute. You le
ft Theresienstadt and went to --
 
A: Auschwitz.
 
Q: Auschwitz, okay. We will get to the later 
part in a minute. And 
I was asking you about 
the ride from Theresienstadt to Au
schwitz, and you said it took three --
 
A: Three, four days. I don't reme mb er exactly.
 
Q: Yeah. And that particular trip, again, was 
the feeling of the people -- did they have any 
idea where they were going?
 
A: We didn't know where we we
re going, no, I said this. We
 didn't know.  We had no 
idea.
 
Q: Did th ey let you get out at all?
 
A: No. No way.
 
Q: What were the sensations in the car? Was there any light?
 
A: No. There was no light in there. Cattle bar -- cars.
 
Q: Could you lie down at all?
 
A: We were sitting down. There 
were about 50 people in there.
 
Q: Was it all men?
 
A:  I don't remember. I think we were all me
n. No, no, we were mixed. From Auschwitz 
away we were all men.
 

Q: And then you got to Auschw
itz and you said you were se
parated from your father and 
that was the last time you 
saw him. And then  wh ere did you -- where did you go in  
Auschwitz? Where did you --
 
A:  I went to the (unintelligible). I got clea
n in and I got dirty out. My hair was shaved 
and they  took all the clothes away, everything
 I had they  took away  and gave me the 
striped uniforms. And then we we
re sent to one of those mogs
 (ph). And we were sitting, 
I don't know, a week. And they  
asked for volunteers for Buchen
wald. So I said let's go to 
Buch enwald. And th en when  we le
ft there, it was September 2,
 and we left and went over 
in cattle cars again.
 
Q: Okay . How many -- how many people went with you?
 
A: There were about 50. In half a thing, half
 a box car only, because the other half were 
the SS in there.
 
Q: These were young people like you?
 
A: Mostly young men, yeah.
 
Q: Young men volunteered to go to Buch enwald?
 
A: I didn't know ever
ybody volunteered, but Œ
 
Q: Well, you did.
 
A: Quite a lot volunteered to get out of -- out of Au schwitz.
 
Q: Uh huh. Because you knew wh
at was happening in Auschwitz?
 
A: I saw what was going on. We didn't  get no food.
 
Q: They did not give you any food th at week?
 
A: When they carried the food 
through the block, people co
ming out, they kill them, they 
shoot them. But they were goi
ng under with  the food co ntainer and ro bbed  the food 
container. So the mo st of them
 was in the underground. Before
 they come to the block, 
they had no food. Bu t wh
en  we left there, they gave us a piece of bread. One lo af of 
bread, actually, not a piece, a loaf of bread, 
a piece of sausage and a piece of cheese.
 
Q: Each person?
 
A:  Each person, right. Till 
I get to the box car I had no more bread, I had no more 
sausage, I had no more cheese. I eat everythi
ng up. Then we were f
our days in that box 
car to go to Auschwitz w
ithout food, without water.
 
Q: To go to --
 

A: Auschwitz -- Kaufering. That's  a comman
do post from Dauchau. It was not far from 
Dauchau, camp  number three, I was.
 
Q: And in the car you said wa
s half filled with German Œ
 
A: Half were the SS and half were -- there were three or four people in there and Œ
 
Q: And how did they treat you?
 
A: Well, they didn't say anything to us. They
 just said if one goe
s -- tries to escape --
 
Q: Escape?A: We shoot them all. And the trai
n when we left Auschwitz went to ViennA: 
I could see from the top under a bridge wh er
e we passed on the train, I see the house 
where I used to live. And I tried with the barb
ed wire, and then he sa
id if one goes away, 
everybody is dead. So
 I said forget it. I didn 't do it. I don't want to go.
 
Q: Okay . And th en you got to Kaufering. Yo u got off th e train?
 
A: Kaufering, yeah.
 
Q: And where did -- what did y
ou do when  you got off the train?
 
A: I went to -- that was bad. Very, very ba
d. The first two weeks I think I lost all the 
weight. I was skeleton. Nearly a skeleton. I c
ouldn't walk anymore, we were full of lice. I 
had one shirt on for six months and that was my
 towel and ev erything. I slept in it at night 
and I worked in the -- at night -- for the fi
rst two weeks we were carrying cement bags 
from the box car to the cement mix er. That 
was going steady. Steady, steady for two 
weeks I did this. And I said to my self, if I 
keep on doing this, I 
won't live long. So I 
disappeared  always. I got caught a few times.
 
Q: Where did you disappear to?
 
A: One of the big halls with the lager ha
us (ph) where they place the cement, the 
warehouses, and I crawled up th ere and I made a hole.
 
Q: To the ceiling?
 
A: I made a hole and was laying in there and 
I covered my self and I slept a couple hours 

every night and I went down . I got caught a co
uple times, too, and th
ey hit me. But it was 
worth it. It was worth it.
 
Q: What was the living arrangements like in Kaufering?
 
A: Not good. Very, very bad.
 
Q: Describe the barracks. Were they barracks?
 
A: The barracks were all right. Wooden, wo

A: Platform, right, with two blankets each
. And that was not enough. It was cold.
 
Q: What time of year were you in Kaufering?

February, '44-'45.

A: Yeah, it was bad. It was really bad.
 
Q: And what about food?

Q: A bowl?
 
A: A bowl. We got a soup and a piece of -- 
slice of bread. That's all we get all day.
 
Q: Did you have any frie
nds who were your age?
 
A: Oh, yes, oh, yes. They passed away. They  
all passed away. I buried them, too, then. I 
was, after those first two weeks, the cam
p -- not the commander, there was an SS man 
there, but the camp (spoke in German
), that means the ca
mp first inmate.
 
Q: Right.
 
A: He was a Viennese. And we were -- we were
 -- we were left nine Viennese and four 
Czechoslovakians and were singing at night a 
little bit.And this man came in at night and 

sung with us and he -- he is
 the one who saved our lives.
 
Q: In what way?
 
A: In wh at way? Because he took us out of 
that cement factory. He put us in the camp . 
And we did everything. We digged  holes, we
 buried th e dead, we went to other camp s 
with the hand wagon to get some
 provisions, me, then whatev
er for the camp. And we got 
in the kitchen. And we were in the kitchen,
 and we were bad guys
, too. We stole. We 
stole potatoes, whatever we put our hand
s on. That was our life. He saved us.
 
Q: What was his name ?
 
A: His name was Neches (ph), Vichy (ph) Nech
es. I don't know if he is still alive. I don't 
think so. I met him once after the war in Vienna.
 
Q: So you lived in th ese barracks and left
 the cement factory, did these other jobs?
 
A: Yeah, I work ed in  the camp after. We didn't go out on command anymore. I mean 

outside.
 

Q: Outside.
 
A: We stayed inside the fence.
 
Q: Uh-huh. And for how
 long did you do th at?
 
A: Until the end. Until the end. Until the -- 
the -- what, the Americans came from one 
side -- right now the Americans only came fro
m one side and they  closed the camp  and 
we had to march for at leas
t five, six days. We were in
 a march from Kaufering to --
 
Q: When the Americans came di
d you know th at, were you Œ
 
A: Well, we only saw the plane flying over 
when  they  dropped the bomb. The lights went 
out from the fans.
 
Q: This is an American plane?
 
A: American plane, when they were bom
bing Munich. They were bombing Munich. The 
lights went out always and we 
were happy. We were lucky no
 bomb fell in.  But on the 
march from Kaufering, we were supposed to go 
to  Dauchau. Bu t we came  again next to 
Dauchau, Allach. They  called 
this Allach, the camp was A
llach. And next to the Camp 
Allach was a German artillery, and the Amer
icans were shooting in  and th e Germans 
were shooting back. And every 
American shell that went to shore came in the camp. 
There were a lot of dead peopl
e. But in the morning then itwas April the 30th, April the 
30th, 1945, I was right. And I run away right away.
 
Q: When  you said you were on this ma rch go
ing to the different camps, different camp, 
what were the conditions of the march?
 
A: No food. A lot of people fell over. A lot of 
people died, a lot of people run aw ay, they  
hide. I don't know what happened.
 
Q: Did you go with anybody sp ecifically?
 
A: I tried once, but I came back. I had always
 my future brother-in-law was with me all 
the time.
 
Q: This was someone you met in the camp?
 
A: No, no, we know him in Vienna. Th
at's my wife's -- 
my  wife's  brother.
 
Q: Okay . He was with you all along?
 
A: In Theresienstadt, in Au schwitz, in Kaufering.
 
Q: He followed along with you. And his name?
 
A: Was Landau, Ivick (ph) Landau. He passed away.
 

Q: So you tw o stayed  togeth er?
 
A: Always.
 
Q: Was he a young man your age?
 
A: He was older than me. I think 
four years, three or four years.
 
Q: Uh-huh. But you stayed together with him?
 
A: Always together.
 
Q: Uh-huh.
 
A: I helped him, he helped me.
 
Q: Did you have any other friends?
 
A: Well, lots of friends I had.
 
Q: People helped each other?
 Did you have the sense that
 people helped each other?
 
A: There were nine Viennese in that Kauferi
ng. We stuck really t
ogether and we helped  
each other. We did a lot of 
bad things, too, in there.
 
Q: Like what?
 
A: Not -- I didn't  kill anybody, no, but I -- we 
broke in -- in the -- in the kitchen, because 
we know where everything wa
s, you know. We took the me
at out, the sausages out for 
the SS. The next day the SS over fuhrer came
 in and said we had to  go in, we had 
trucking transport, transport Œ
 
Q: Group?
 
A: Group, yeah, than k you. And we have to  
search the camp . And that the oldest one, 
Mr. Niches (ph), he had all the camp, we know
 where it was right away
 when he said, so 
we went to each one. And he said this is 
the Red Cross. We had 
our barracks, the Red 
Cross had blankets and milk was inside and 
we had th e key. And 
we hide everything 
there. And he went inside, Mr. Niches, the ol
dest, camp  oldest, got 
in  and found it right 
away and he came out and (spoke in German) th
ere is nothing inside.S o we were lucky, 
otherwise we would be hanged. 
Because the camp hanged a lo t of people in the camp, in
 
Kaufering.
 
Q: Did you see people being hung?
 
A: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. I saw people between 
the fence. They got caught stealing potatoes, 
they put potatoes in their mouth. You st
ayed between the two wires for many, many 

hours. When  they didn't want to live anymore,
 they just touch the wire and they fell over. 
When  anything you steal, they put you between the wires.
 
Q: Did you ever feel just like giving up?
 
A: No. I had a will, will to live. I always ha
d the will to live. I think I was strong. I was 
very strong. I saw so many people dying, dyi
ng like flies, but I never gave up. And I 
always washed myself.  I dried myself in my 
shirt that was six months old. At night I put 
it under the blanket so it dries. And I was shiver
ing, but still it dries for the next day to go 
to work. But I washed mysel
f. The people -- the first tw o 
weeks when th
ey were in 
Kaufering, they had the cement coming out of th
eir ears, out of their nose, and it was like, 
like concrete. They couldn't get that o
ff no more because they never washed.
 
Q: Where did you get the water from?
 
A: Well, we had a fountain, we had Œ
 
Q: Faucets?
 
A: We call it -- it was a little hot, a fa
ucet around, but no towels, no soap.
 
Q: What were the sanitary facilities like?
 
A: Very bad. Very, very bad.
 The toilet was called the latrin
e, and there was just one two-
by-four, four-by, something like that, and ever
ybody was sitting on it next to each other.
 
Q: Um-hmm, um-hmm. And your health, you said --
 
A: My health went bad after I got freed. I ha
d typhus, typhus. I got freed on the 30th of 
April in Allach, and I went
 with Landau, I went --
 
Q: What were your feelings wh en you got fre
ed, when  you realized wh at had happened ?
 
A:   Well, the war is over and we live. That's a
ll. I want to live. I want to live. So we went 
to -- we took a car from Luftwa
ffe and we drove to Salzburg.
 
Q: How did you get the car?
 
A: It was standing in  the street with the keys 
inside. It is a long story, too. Bu t, anyway, 
we came to Salzburg.
 
Q: And the two of you 
just got in the car?
 
A: Got in  the car and we drove. And I was sick
, I was very, very sick.  I didn't know what 
I had. And we came to Salzburg and th ey t
ook away the car from 
us, but wh en th ey 
opened th e door I fell and I went unconsciou
s. So they put me 
in a L azarette, in a 
hospital, in a German hospital. They  didn't know
 I was in -- because I didn't speak a word  
of English.
 

Q: Okay . You were 19 ye
ars old at this point?
 
A: Something like th at. I didn't speak a word
 of English and I di
dn 't  even know what 
German means. I swear th at's the truth. I said I am Germ
an, I am German. I want to say I 
am a Jew, I am a Jew. And I 
said I am German, because I h
ear that so often, you know. 
So finally explained to me a chaplain that
, I don't even know the name, Kaplan, Kaplan 
was his name. He sai d  don 't ever  say that 
again. Sothey put 
me in that hospital.
 
Q: This is in Salzburg?
 
A: In Salzburg. They pu
t me in that hospital and that wa
s -- the war ends on that day and 
there were a lot of shooting going on. And I 
was scared because there were only German 
people in there. So I explained it to them.Th
en they transferred me 
to -- they transferred 
me to Landis Kartenhaus (ph) in  Salzburg.
 
Q: This is the American Army th
at kind of took y
ou under its wing?
 
A: Right. They put me in that
 Lazarette, in that hospital with
 the German soldiers. I didn't 
want to go in there, I was afra
id. So finally they 
send me to Landis Kartenhaus, (ph) and 
there I was about a month, month and a half.
 
Q: Was that also in Salzburg?
 
A: In Salzburg, the Landis Kart
enhaus (ph). I still got (unintelligible). That's th e only two 
things I got. And I was th
ere for about 30 days.
 
Q: Recovering from typhus?
 
A: Typhus, yeah.
 
Q: Uh-huh. And you were very thin?
 
A: Skeleton. Real skeleton. But like I say, 
I am lucky I am alive. I am still alive.
 
Q: Where was your future 
brother-in-law at 
that point? Was he still with you?
 
A: No -- I was in the hospital and he met on
e of the kapos in Sa
lzburg from our camp, 
too. It was a Viennese, too, and all of a su
dden he came -- an Amer
ican soldier came in 
the hospital, and I looked, it was the kapo from 
the camp . It was a Jewish boy wearing an 
American uniform. I said, "How
 you got on a unifo rm?" He 
worked for the CIC, and I 
did the same thing. When I got out, 
I worked  a few months in Hielbrunn.
 
Q: So you were in r
ecuperating from typhus?
 
A: Right.
 
Q: And then you got out?
 

A: I got out and I went to the American 
Army  for a few weeks. I was looking fo r SS 
people.
 
Q: They hired you, the American Army?
 
A: They hired me. They took me in the wings
 -- under their wings. And they  put me in it 
because I spoke German. And they  were sayi
ng to  me, don't say nothing. Just listen. And 
if I see somebody with a tatt
oo under the arm, then we know
 it is the SS. I catched only 
one.
 
Q: And you came and 
told the Americans?
 
A: Oh, yeah, oh, yeah. And th

Infantry, Third Division. A long time with them.

Q: Noth ing?
 
A: They treated me so nice. 
And I said to myself, there wa
s a demarcation line between -- 
in Austria between Linz, Wuffe (ph), and I said 
I want to go back to Vienna. And so I left 
them and I could not go over to the Russian si
de -- they didn't  let me -- I couldn't go with 
them. So I came back to Salz
burg. So I worked for the Ra
inbow Division in th e kitchen 
for the time being, and after 
this I got back to Vienna.
 
Q: When  did you get back to Vienna?
 
A: September 26th, 1945.
