What you are about to hear 
fr om  Rita is  one individual's  ac c ount of the Holocaus t. We have prepar ed a brief s lide pr es entation to

We begin with this portr ait of Rita, s hown here between her  Aunt Bella and c ous in, Bayla 
Shulwolf, who peris hed in the Holoc aus t.
 

 
Rita was  bor n Rifka Lifs chitz in Dec ember
 
1936 in Vasc auti, Rom ania. The ar row on this  m ap

weave native Ukrainian clothing that was  s old in the s tor e.
 
 
In 1940, the Soviet Arm y m ar c hed into Vas c auti and dr afted young men, inc luding Rita's

When Axis  tr oops invaded the Soviet Union the next year , Romanian s oldier s

br ibe Rom anian s oldier s , who took the family to a ghetto in Trans
nis tr ia. The area known as  
Transnis tr ia is  s hown on this  map.
 
 
Onc e ther e, a village family took Rita's  family in. Rita was  able to attend a small c las s  but 
dur ing the three year s the fam ily lived in the ghetto they fac ed terrible har dships . After they 
were 
liberated the fam ily was  eventually able to retur n hom e.
 
 
After the war , Rita attended a Uk rainian s c hool in what had bec om e Communis t Romania. By 
obtaining fals e papers, Rita, her mother , and her aunt wer e able to travel from Rom ania to a Dis plac ed 

P

F

P

having s ever al of your family m embers  in attendanc e with us  today. You have a gr eat deal to tell us  s o 
we will s tart right away.
 
 
Although World War II began with Germ any and the Soviet Union attacking Poland in 
September
 
1939, war didn't c om e dir ectly in your c omm unity in Romania until 1940. Before we turn to 
your  life dur ing the war and the Holoc aus t, let's  s tart first with you telling us  a little bit about your  family 
and their c om munity and your  ear ly life before war actually began for you.

> > Rita Rubenstein:  Ok . That's  going back a long way. 
A
s  you heard
, 
I'm 79 now. Going back to age 4, 
I have fr agmented piec es  of m em ory but I do r emem ber s ome happy times , thank God. You know, as  a 
hum an being, we tr y to bloc k  out the bad. Rem ember  the bad, too, of c our se.
 
 
I had a
 
wonderful family. My dad, mother, lived with us . We s hared a two
-
family home. He 
was  doing well. He had two s is ter s  in the United States who em igrated when they were only 16 and 17 

bec aus e my gr andm other was  a widow, left with four  c hildren after World Wa
r I. So s he s ent the other 
two to the golden land where you c ould find gold. But they wound up work ing in s weats hops . So we did 
have s om e fam ily whom  I never  m et. My m other had not m et either. And her  two younger  c hildren wer e 
left with her. And then they did well. They had a textile m ac hine, weaving room. They would weave 
native c os tumes , as  you mentioned, and s c ar ves . 
 
 
My m other s tood in a s tor e. They had a s tore, two
-
family hous e. It was  a modern hous e.We 
had a r adio.We had electr ic ity, not running water yet but we had a nanny for me. My grandmother lived 

with us . My father 's mother . And then his  s is ter and two c hildren and the grandm other
 
--
 
m y unc le's  
m other  lived with them as  well. So we had two older
 
--
 
we wer e all together in the one hous e. 
 
 
It w
as  a very happy time. I had a doll c arr iage, dolls , lots of fr iends . I was  the first 
grandc hildr en. My m other was  one of eight c hildren. Unfortunately only two of them, s he and her s ister, 

s ur vived.
 
My grandparents  lived in a small village not far from us.
 
We would fr equently vis it them. They 
were doting gr andpar ents . I had aunts  and unc les and aunts  only s even years older than us.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So a very lar ge extended family.
 
> > Rita Rubenstein:  Large extended fam ily. My grandm other, who lived with us, didn't want m e to 
m ake us e of the doll c arriage too muc h. She s ays , 
ﬁD
on't tak e it out s o muc h.
ﬂ 
Unfortunately little did 
we know that I would not use it for  ver y long period of tim e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Tell us a little bit about your m other and father
. W
h
at do you know about your father? 
 
> > Rita Rubenstein:  My father  was  a wonderful
 
--
 
what I hear d bec aus e I don't r eally rec all. I do rec all 
that he would take m e every Sabbath to tem ple. He loved to perform s ervic es . Of c ourse, he had lost 

his  father  but 
he did a lot of good for people. In the dr y goods  s tor e, if s omebody c ould not affor d an 
item  that they like, he would get them credit. Said 
ﬁD
on't worr y
. P
ay me when you c an.
ﬂ 
Very c har itable.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Had a lovely voic e, you told m e. Right?
 
>> 
Rita Rubenstein:  Oh, yes . He had a wonderful voic e. They wanted him  to c onduct s ervic es . He als o 
s er ved on the ritual c omm ittee. So I tried to follow in his  footsteps . I guess  I love to s ing and that's 

wher e I inherited that fr om him.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You
 
definitely c ontinued that.
 
> > Rita Rubenstein:  Yes.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  One of your gr andfather s s er ved in the Fir s t WorldWar. Is  that right?
 
> > Rita Rubenstein:  Yes. He was  killed then.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Do you know anything about his  s er vic e? 
 
> > Rita Ru
benstein:  Not really. No.
 
> > Bill Bens on: What languages did your fam ily s peak? 
 
> > Rita Rubenstein:  Ok . Well, this  was  Aus tra
-
Hungar y befor e I was  born. Then it bec ame Rom ania. I 
was  born in Rom ania. So a lot of the Jewis h fam ilies  s poke Germ an to their  c hildr en but m y 
grandm other, m ay s he res t in peac e, s he ins isted that her gr anddaughter would s peak Yiddis h and 
thanks  to her that I did speak  Yiddis h
. A
nd I learned how to read and write it later  on in D.P. camp. So 
that's  wher e I have the love of Yiddis h as  well, thanks to her.
 
They als o s poke Germ an, Romanian. I did 
not s peak  Rom anian at all bec aus e I had not gone to s c hool there.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Rita, of c our s e, war  began when the Soviet Union and Germ any atta
cked Poland in 

1939, beginning Wor ld War 
II. It was  s ome m onths later, though, befor e war direc tly affected you and 
your  fam ily when the Soviets  oc c upied your  hometown of Vas c auti in Rom ania in 1940
. A
lthough you 
were not yet 4 at that time, tell us  what you c an from what you've been able to gather  and lear n and 
fr agments you r em em ber  about the time under the Soviet oc c upation of the 
first time 
that you wer e 
oc c upied by the Soviets .

> > Rita Rubenstein:  Well, our happy fam ily life r eally c hanged.We had to c los e the s tore. My mother's 
s is ter had been with us . That was  her good luck . She was  with us  for a year. She was  seven years  
younger  than m y m other.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Bella?
 

> > Rita Rubenstein:  The only s ur viving sis ter . Right. She worked at a tax offic e. I was  no longer fr ee to 
play in the s tr e
ets . They took all the
 
--
 
they c ons cripted all the able
-
bodied men into the Arm y. And, of 
c our s e, my father  was  one of the able
-
bodied men. That was the las t time I was  to s ee him. I was  4
 
1/2 
at the tim e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So he's  c ons c r ipted into the Sovi
et A rm y?
 
> > Rita Rubenstein:  Into the Soviet Ar m y. For s om e reas on m y unc le was  not. That was  the las t tim e I 

s aw my dad
, w
hen he left with the Rus s ian Army. But at leas t I have the knowledge that he was  fighting 
agains t the Germans. He was  in their Arm y.
 
 
I have
 
--
 
well, we'll talk about that.
 
> > Bill Bens on: We'll c om e back  to that later.
 
> > Rita Rubenstein:  Yes.
 
> > Bill B ens on:  Tell m e
 
--
 
m any other m en were dr afted into the labor br igades  and into the Arm y. Your 
father was  just 36 or 37 year s  of ag e at that time, I think. Now it's  your m other and your  aunt. Your 

father's gone. Do you know how they wer e able to make ends m eet during that tim e? 
 
> > Rita Rubenstein:  Ther e was  a black  market. They us ed to barter, you k now, have exc hanges . It 
was  a toug
h tim e for  us. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  One of the things  I know you're going to talk to a little bit later is  about what you 

br ought with you, the pr ayer  s hawl
 
that was  your  father's . 
 
> > Rita Rubenstein:  That was  m y father's.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  I k now we'll c om e
 
back to that. You mentioned that it was  Bella's  good fortune that s he 
was  with you. Say a little bit m or e about that.Why was  it her good for tune?
 
> > Rita Rubenstein:  The r eas on it was  her good fortune, my grandfather  als o owned a dry goods  store 
as  well
 
as  an orc hard. He had many friends, Uk rainian friends . And they, too, would c ome
 
--
 
he was  a 
very 
p
ious  man. My gr andm other worked ver y hard. She had eight c hildr en. She did everything fr om 
s c r atc h. Even her jams  were made fr om  sc r atc h, everything
. 
A ll of
 
that c hanged, of c ours e, when the 
Ukrainian neighbors  who wer e fr iends, they thought
 
--
 
ther e's a spec ial exhibit, in fac t
. T
hey tur ned on 
us . We did not know that until after the war . After  the war  m y m other  wanted to know what happened to 

her  fam ily. Th
ey des c r ibed to her the horr ible death that they m et. They us ed harm im plements . My 
grandfather had to witnes s  how they brutally murder ed m y aunt and unc le. Telling that to a s urvivor , m y 

m other  was  28 at the time, to hear  the hor rible death that they met.
 
It was
 
--
 
needles s  to s ay.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  I think we'r e r ight around the anniver s ar y date of when that happened.
 
> > Rita Rubenstein:  Yes. Yes. And he was  left till the end. He had to witnes s  how they mur dered, not 
killed but really m ur der ed, his  family
 
and then they murder ed him
, a
 
horrible end.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  J une
 
22, 1941, 75 year s ago today, Germ any and its  allies  tur ned on the Soviets  and 
Rom anian tr oops , Germany's  allies , oc c upied your  town.
 
> > Rita Rubenstein:  Yes, they did.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And that's  when things  r eally turned pr ofoundly wor s e. Tell us
 
--
 
you remember, as  I 
unders tand, when the Rom anian troops m ar c hed in.
 
> > Rita Rubenstein:  Yes.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Tell us about that tim e and what happened once you wer e under the c ontr ol of th
e 
Rom anians  and the Nazis .
 
> > Rita Rubenstein:  I do r em em ber  the m arc h. In fact, m y c ous in, who was  seven year s  older than I, 
he was  adventur ous . He went up to the attic  and looked outs ide. He was  watc hing them marc h. A 
s oldier  notic ed that s om ebody was  looking out. They cam e in with bayonets . They s aid, "Ok . You have 
s pies  here." Here was  my m other, m y grandm other , and then my aunt and unc le.We did not know 
what to do.We wer e r eally fr ightened. The kids all went under  the beds . They s aid
, ﬁ
Look , we didn
't 
m ean any harm. He just looked outs ide.

> > Bill Bens on:  J us t a little boy.
 
> > Rita Rubenstein:  Yes. He was  jus t a little boy. He was  about 9 or 10, not even. Yeah. So that was  
first taste of it. 
 
 
Then they took
 
--
 
m y aunt was  wor king, as  I explained befor e. They took  20 J ews  out in the 
c our tyar d, at random, really; just bec aus e they were J ews . They wanted to s how ever ybody their  
s tr ength and what they would do. They s hot them s imply bec aus e they were J ews . And one 
of them 

worked in the s am e office as  m y aunt. He was  an engineer .
 
 
In September  of 
`
41, an announc ement was  made to all the J ews  that we had to be ready 
within 24 hour s to leave our hom e and only c ould take with us  whatever we c ould c arr y, nothing else. 
My
 
m other had hidden what was  dear to us . That's  why I have s om e pictures , s ome of my fr iends  who 
ar e sur vivors  have no pic tures of their youth. She put photographs and s om e money in the attic  but in 
the floor  of the attic . My grandm other
 
--
 
I r em ember that.
 
She had m oney s ewn in her  undergarm ents  
and I s aid, gr andma, what ar e you doing that for
? 
She s aid, "You never  know. It might s ave our lives ." 
And, indeed, s he was  a wis e lady
.  
It did s ave our lives .
 
I do r emem ber being bundled up in layers  and 
layer s  of 
c lothing.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So tak e whatever  you c ould c arr y. So you put lots  of c lothes  on.
 
> > Rita Rubenstein:  Exac tly. And bedding. And they had it in s ack s . My m other held on to my father's 

s uits  and his pr ayer s hawl. It's amazing that's  the only thing
 
that did s ur viv e the war . So it has a lot of 
m eaning to m e.
 
> > Bill Bens on: When they told you to be prepar ed to leave in 24 hour s, do you know if you had any 

idea where they intended to take you? 
 
> > Rita Rubenstein:  Ac tually, no. But wor d was  that they wer e s uppos ed to take us  to a death c am p. 

We wer e tak en by a tr ain.We wer e in a holding plac e. My unc le had over hear d s om e people.We were 

s uppos ed to be in the death c amp.
 
> > Bill Bens on: Who was  with you at this  point?
 
> > Rita Rubenstein:  Oh, at this  point, ok, ther e wer e nine of us.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Nine of you. Ok .
 
> > Rita Rubenstein:  My aunt and her c hildr en and hus band and her m other
-
in
-
law, and my Aunt Bella, 
m y mother's s ister, my mother, m y gr andmother , and mys elf. So there were nine. And we wer e all 
together.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And you had hear d that you were going to end up going to a death c amp.
 

> > Rita Rubenstein:  Yes. Of c ours e our life was  in danger bec aus e they could have s hot us. This was  
at night that we s nuck  out. They took  us  acr os s a r iver on barges . Ther e were m any s oldier s , even 

though they took  the money, that's where my gr andmother's m oney
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Go back  over that
. Y
our unc le, this  is  wher e he br ibed s oldiers ?
 
> > Rita Rubenstein:  He br ibed them with the money that m
y grandm other had.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So to avoid going where you thought you were going.
 

> > Rita Rubenstein:  Right. They wer e going to take us  to Tr ans nistria, 
S har gor ot,
 
a ghetto. In one 
s pec ial plac e you had r es tric tions. You c ould only go out at c ertain
 
tim es . But I'll explain the c onditions  
ther e. 
 
 
Let m e get back to the point. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Your uncle bribes .
 
> > Rita Rubenstein:  Yes.We s nuck  out at night. We wer e on a barge cr os s ing the Dnieper River. A 
s oldier  was holding me by the hand. I was  a blond, brown eyes  at the time. And the s oldier
 
--
 
ther e 
were s om e righteous
 
--
 
thank  God there were righteous  gentiles . Ther e were always  good people. I 
wis h ther e had been more. Som e more people would have been s aved. He looked at m y mother's  

anguis hed 
face and s aid, "Don't worr y. I have a little girl just like that at hom e and I will do no har m to 
your  c hild." He m eant what he s aid. We thank  God, cros s ed the Dnieper  River  and it was  ok. So that 

was  fir st time s he almos t los t me. But one of a few tim es .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You had explained to m e befor e that ther e wer e other  c hildren on barges who didn't 
m ake it.

> > Rita Rubenstein:  They wer e thr own into the r iver . They didn't know how to s wim. I did not know how 
to s wim either . So if the s am e would have be
en
 
--
 
would have happened to m e.

Tell us  about that time. You s pent three year s th

> > Bill Bens on:  Ok .
 
> > Rita Rubenstein:  Ther e wer e J ews  ther e, in the ghetto. They wer e forced to take us in. They were 
very kind 
to
 
take us in. This  was  s o different fr om what we were
 
--
 
it was  
a c lay hut, r eally, one bedroom 
heated by a potbelly s tove
, v
er y prim itive c onditions . They had no bathroom. It was  bitter c old. Excus e 
m e for s aying, but we had to us e the p
ail
. They wer e a family of four . And nine of us c ame. So there 
were 13 in that small hut. We wer e r ationed.We had no food. There, too, was  a black  m arket. My aunt 
had wonderful abilities  as  a knitter  and would s neak  out on the black  mark et to bring us a little piec e of 
br ead, potatoes . 
 
 
The nutr ition was  not very good, to s ay the least. And how we m anaged in that hous e, I don't 
know. And my unc le developed Typhus . They left us  after  about a year  bec aus e it was  jus t too hard to 

be together.We didn't have enough food. They went to a differ ent labor c am p.
 
 
At that ghetto ther e wer e s oldier s , Romanian s oldiers  that c am e and took  m y aunt every day 
to work in the field.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Aunt Bella?
 
> > Rita Rubenstein:  Yeah. I don't know why they didn't take m y m other. She never s har ed it with m e. 
She did not like to s peak  about her exper ienc es  too muc h. She didn't want m
e 
to tell m y c hildr en. "Oh, 
why pain them ?"  I s aid it's  impor tant that they know what life was  like
 a
nd how luc ky we ar e
 i
n this  
c ountr y to have ever ything.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  One of the things  you s hared with m e was  you r em embered the s ens e of always  being 
hungry.
 
> > Rita Rubenstein:  Yes.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Always  hungr y.
 
> > Rita Rubenstein:  Always  being hungry. Mentioned a little kindergarten c las s  was  for med.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  In the ghetto?
 
> > Rita Rubenstein:  In the ghetto. That's  wher e I had my first exper ienc e with Hebrew. I was  thrilled to 
death when I was  able to tell them that today I had a piec e of bread and oil. But c hildr en, c hildren 
always  find playthings. My mother m ade us a rag doll. What s aved us, r eally, was I was  never 
s epar ated fr om m y m other. I was  very fortunate. I s aw death in the s treets.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  People liter ally s tarved to death and you remember that.
 
> > Rita Rubenstein:  Starved to death.
 
 
She went to the river , whic h was at leas t about a m ile
, 
to was h our clothing. Cleanlines s  was  
very impor tant.We found little pebbles . They m ade us  a mak es hift road.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Thos e wer e your play toys ? 
 
> > Rita Rubenstein:  Thos e were my toys . Onc e I went to do laundry with m y m other with m y c ous in. I 
g

A
unt 
T
abel, 
ther e's  a little girl in the water ." She didn't know how to s wim . I didn't know how to s wim. She threw in a

And they had s om e witc hc r aft perfor med

> > Rita Rubenstein:  Who knows
? 
Yes  it did work . It did work .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  During that time after your father had been
 
c ons cr ipted into the Soviet Army, do you 
know if your  m other had any c ontac t, had any word fr om him, any idea wher e he had gone?
 
> > Rita Rubenstein:  No. We had no inkling whatsoever .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Onc e he left he was gone.
 
> > Rita Rubenstein:  And m y grandmother was  really bes ide hers elf. She was  very ill. At the time, I 
don't know if you know this , s ome people who are not J ewis h probably don't know, but we are bur ied
 
in 
s
hr ouds . And my gr andm other had a little s ack  of s oil, bec aus e we'r e s uppos ed to be bur ied with a little 

s oil fr om Is rael. And I ques tioned
 
--
 
yo
u know, as a c hild you question
 
why  is  this, why is  that.Why ar e 
you having thes e white things  s ewn
? 
She s aid, "I'm not going to be here long. You're m y grandc hildren. 
I want you to light the c andles  when I'm gone." She's  the only one that r eally died in ac tual death there 

and the only one that I have a gr aves ite for .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And that's  in Shargorot? 
 
> > Rita Rubenstein:  That's in Shargorot
,  
whic h I've never gone back. I really have no des ire to. Thos e 
m em or ies  were not good mem ories. But I r em ember that. I remem ber her death. 
 

 
Of c ours e, the r itual c ommittee cam e. They had to pr epar e her, put on the garm ents. I s aw all 
of that. But at that time they did not take m e to the c em eter y. T
hey felt I was  too young. I s aw a lot. It 
was  a great los s . That I rem em ber . And I r em ember  lighting a candle for her .
 
So ther e
 
were hard tim es  
but we wer e with very kind people. As poor as they were, out of the goodnes s  of their  heart, they really 
took us
 
in.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And it sounds  like during that time in the ghetto with this  k ind, good

hearted family, that 
ever ybody tr ied to m ak e the best of having a c ommunity as  m uc h as  you could under  thos e 

c irc umstanc es.
 
 
The Soviets  cam e back  to Shargor ot, however , in ear ly 1944, but this  time they wer e

to this  day I r eally c an't stand a lot of nois e. And another 
point, I am 
very afr aid of big dogs, like Germ an Shepher ds , bec aus e I us ed to s ee them c has e J ews . It 
was  very fr ightening.
 
 
In fac t, her e in the United States  I had to ask  my friend who had a German Shepher d

When the front c am e, the Rus s ians , we hear d a lot of bombing. The 
proprietor
 
of the little 
hous e that we were in went to a neighbor bec ause the neighbor  had a c ellar . He s aid if ther e's  bombing 
her e, we need to go down into the c ellar. So we were ther e quite a num ber of people. A 12

old 
boy c ould not stand it anym or e. He had to s ee what was  happening. So he ran outs ide. And when he 

c am e back, he was  all exc ited. People thought
: H

on
? 
He s aid, "No, no, 
no. Ther e wer e Rus s ians dr inking in the str eets and we ar e free. The war  is  over ." And then we s tarted 
believing him . And everybody went outs ide. And, indeed, the war  was  over .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  For you. For wher e your c ommunity was .

the

bec aus e I was  robbed of everything. However, they wanted to go back  home. My m other wanted to 

hear  what happened to her fam ily, what happened to her hus band. But the Ir on Curtain 
started s etting 
in then, too. The Rus s ians  wer e taking over. They had s c hools that wer e es tablis hed there. So we had 
a diffic ult jour ney to get there.

We thought you were mur der ed.

Bec aus e they took over  their  home and they would m urder the sur vivors . So you had to be lucky. That

So it was

into our hous e. The Russ ians  had us ed it as  a silo. They had gr ains  ther e. And my mother begged 
them. She s aid, "I jus t want go in the attic ." "My hus band fought in your  Arm y." At that point s he did not 
know yet that m y fath

let us  into my m ater nal gr andpar ents ' house. They owned the hous e but there were other  fam ilies  there 
but they let us have a r oom  ther e. Hous ing was  very hard.

You're now about 7 year s  of age, s c hool age. Did that s ort of s ens e of

Rus s ians . We wer e indoc tr inated to Stalin's vic tor. I r em em ber walking to s c hool. It was  bitter c old.
 
 
Als o, they did not c elebrate Chr istm as  as s uc h but th

have a big c elebr ation. Then they had us  r ec ite poetry. I had to m em or ize a poem and r ec ite that. I 
r em em ber that. I was  a good s tudent. I was  just in fir st gr ade.
 
 
We s aw that things  wer e not good. And that's  when m y

s ens e of the

throughout Eur ope? 
 
> > Rita Rubenstein:  Oh definitely. Yes.We found out the horr ible things  that happened, and for  our 
whole family and extended fam ily. They wer e either  m ur dered or they s tarved to death. They c ouldn't 

exis t
, w

And the gr andm other. Their grandm other . Mine died, as I s aid befor e. My m other and m y aunt.
 
 
Then we had to find a way to get out of town bec aus e we s aw the hand wr iting on the wall. 
The Ir on Curtain was  s etting in.Where would we go
? 
We had to get out. So we had fals ified paper s

at the bank
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Bella.
 
> > Rita Rubenstein:  Bella. They would not allow her , until the las t minute, to go on that train. It was  not 

a luxury train. Ther e was  als o another inc ident there, a wonderful young m an who is  looking ov
er  
doc um ents  and all. He knew who we were bec aus e his  mother  had been a Chr is tian young m an. His  

m other  was  a m idwife to my gr andmother and helped deliver  s om e of her c hildr en. But he didn't 
dis c los e the fact that we were Rom anian. He look ed away and let us  go on the tr ain. He c ould have and 

we wouldn't have been able to leave. The las t minute they allowed m y aunt to c om e and we went on 
the tr ain.

You d

> > Rita Rubenstein:  We had a long jour ney. That jour ney I do remem ber. Bec aus e we hopped on 

tr ains , on tr ac e c ars, on c oal c ars. It took  us thr ee m onths  to get from Rom ania to Germany.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Via Poland.
 
> > Rita
 
Rubenstein:  To go to differ ent bor der s. We posted Gr eek s , posted differ ent nationalities . They 
would s ear c h us  and s end the c hildren. As  Gr eeks  we as ked for  Mayan, water in Hebrew. They didn't 
know the differ enc e. So they pas s ed us  up quickly.

--
 
that's a good ques tion.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Yeah.Why Germany?
 

> > Rita Rubenstein:  Becaus e they establis hed Dis plac ed Pers ons Camps in Germ any. That's
 
wher e 
s ur vivor s  wound up. In fac t, in s om e of the ver y s ame bar rack s  wher e the SS wer e trained we had 
thes e quar ters . But at leas t we had s helter
. B
ut life was  rebor n. Ther e were many s ad, s ad stories , 
par ents who los t childr en and c hildr en who los t parents. I went with them to s c hool.
 

> > Bill Bens on:  And you did, too.
 
> > Rita Rubenstein:  Oh, yeah. Som e of them wer e hidden in c onvents. Som e of them were hidden in 

hom es
, 
Polis h hom es . And then the parents, s ome par ents , c am e back  or  s om e relatives  c am e ba

Some of them thought they wer e Chris tian, didn't want to leave but then they did. 
 
 
That's when I lear ned how to s peak Polis h. Some people approac hed m y m other  and s tarted 
s peaking Polis h. Why are you s peaking Polis h to me
? 
I don't s peak  a word of it. 
W
ell, your  daughter 
s peaks  Polis h. But as  a c hild, you're for c ed to. 
 
 
I m ade s om e wonderful fr iends . Believe it or not, thos e who s aid, oh, s c hool, do I have to go 
to s c hool
? 
Loved s c hool. We were like s ponges. We were m is s ing that per iod. I don't c ons ider that year  
in the Uk raine s c hool as  very memorable but her e we lear ned histor y and had wonder ful teac hers. 
 

10
 
 
 
There were about a hundr ed of us. Ther e wer e a lot of marr iages. People who los t c hildren. It 
was  s o s ad. I loved to perform. I was  on stage there
 
and learned how to s ing and perform. My mother  
was  s itting in the audienc e and ther e was  a wom an with tears in her eyes . She s aid, "I wonder  if this  
c hild's  m other is  still aliv e to s ee her ." And s he said, "Yes, I am." She s aid, "I los t a little girl like
 
your s . 
You're s o lucky." 
 

 
But as a res ult of our having lived through the war  with the wonderful nutr ition we had, I have 
hor rible teeth. I'm  a dentis t. So dream. And a lot of us bec aus e we didn't have toothbr ushes . We really 
had nothing.
 
> > Bill Bens on:
  
No nutr ition.

Her e, you have to r emem ber this was  in

m y m other was  told that I had TB and I had to go to a sanitar ium. I was  about 9 at the tim e when she

A lot of diffic ult times. Imagine your s elf at 28 having los t your  par ents , having

why my parents never  had another  c hild bec ause Hitler's s peec hes were hear d even the year that I 
was  born. They knew a younger  c hild would not have m ade it. They didn't know what was  waiting for  
them but they felt they shouldn't have any

To s ave my life s he would do anything. She went on the black market with her  s ister

I'm jus t cur ious.

United States  instead?
 
> > Rita Rubenstein:  Becaus e my m other 's only s ur viving s is ter  went to 
the United States. In fact
, 
I 
forgot to mention that when Israel was  dec lar ed independent, I r em ember s taying
 
up all night, around a 
bonfir e bec aus e at last we had a place to c all our own, where to go to. But m y m other s aid no. And m y 

c ous in was  very Zioni

; 
he said, 
ﬁ
I'm not going to the United States
ﬂ  
even though m y aunt had two s is ters  her e. He s aid, 
ﬁ
I wanted to go to my c ountr y.
ﬂ 
So that is the 
r eas on they went to Israel and I went to the United States . I wanted to be
 
on the exodus. I told her 
s inc e I'm half an orphan. And s he s aid, 
ﬁM
y only child, you're not going anywhere.

I'm ver y glad I made the c hoic e to be her e. Of c ours e, I have a s pec ial love for  Is rael. Thank
