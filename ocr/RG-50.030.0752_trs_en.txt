A: My father was away mo st of the time, and 
my  mo ther is the one that took care of us 
for the most part. 

Q: Then    was he away on business or
 was he away for different reasons?

do you reme mber the bus
iness that he was in? 
A: Textile. 

Q: Textile.  Does that mean    did he ha
ve his own factory or 
his own store or    
A: I really don't know.  I was a little bit young 
to ask questions.  In f
act, I just didn't  get 
answers, you know, even if I aske
d, you know.  So I don't know. 
Q: And how    did your mo ther 
also work to support the family? 
A: She did the best she could. 
Q: Okay .  What kind of wo rk did she do? 

Interv iew with J a cques Ribo ns

A: Well, my father used to send her some 
mo ney and th en my  father used to send her 
some things to sell.  She we
nt around the neighborhood and,
 you know, she sold  things 
like    I guess, like butter, refrigerated butter. 
Q: I see. 

A: He would send so me other stuff.  He
'd  sen d  her some money occasionally. 
Q: Uh huh.   
A: And I just saw him on the holidays, so... 
Q: Really?  So he was away
 from the house that much? 
A: Most of the time. 
Q: So is it    would it be fair to say  that
 you didn't get to know your father very well? 
A: Yes, I got to know him.  
He came for the holidays.   
Q: Uh huh. 
A: He came home.  And it wasn't  a good life. 
Q: It was not or it was     
A: No, it was not. 

Q: It was not. 
A: Looking back at it. 
Q: What    how do you come
 to that conclusion now when 
you say it was not a good life?  
What made it not good?   
A: Because my mother struggled  to feed us. 
 She struggled to send us to school.  She 
struggled  all alone.  And, you know, I didn't
 have any shoes and I wo re my  mo ther's 
shoes.

Q: It mu st have b
een hard for you. 
A: It was very difficult. 
Q: I can also imagine other kids making fun of
    of a child wearing a grownup's shoes? 

A: Not really.  We were generally isolated
.  We lived in a ne
ighborhood where most 
people were non Jews.  And the Jewish peop
le were located downto
wn the city or the 
town.  And so it wasn
't a very good life.  
Q: What kind of a place did you 
   did you live in the same 
place as a child in the 1930s 
or did you move around? 

A: We moved, you know, a couple time s.  

Q: Okay . 

A: And we lived in    near L
odz wh ere there was a textile.  So we moved    mo ved us and 
himself near Lodz, a small town down there. 

Q: Yeah.  And can you describe to me the  
  the living quarters you reme mb er the best?  
Was there any one place that you lived
 for a longer period of time? 
A: Yes.  The last place that we lived
 in the house, that was three rooms. 
Q: Uh huh. 

A: And a kitchen. 
Q: And was it a self standing house or wa
s there another apartment in it or    
A: It was a    short of like a duplex. 
Q: I see.

Q: You mother's fathe

A: I    I would say poor. 

Q: Uh huh.  And your parents? 
 You say your mo ther struggled.
  So it wasn 't a very good 
life.  Does that mean    
A: My father was    I h ate to say this, but
 he's  been gone and I shouldn't say it, maybe.  
He wasn't the best father around.

wo rds, it had repercussions financially as well? 
A: My mo th er had struggles.  I    you know, 
I was too young to know

Q: Yiddish. And you said you lived in
 a kind of non Jewish neighborhood?  

A: Correct.  

Q: Did you also speak
 Polish or German?  
A: No.  We    we spoke Polish beca
use we did go to Polish schools.  
Q: Uh huh.  Okay .   

A: So, you know, we did speak Polish.
  At home, we spoke Yiddish.  
Q: Uh huh.   

A: And my mother didn't
 speak Polish too well.  
Q: Uh huh.   
A: So communication was in Yiddish.  
Q: Did    was she also born and grew up
 in the same area or had sh e come from 
someplace else?  

Interview with Jacques Ribons  
14 
A: She came from someplace else.  She came fro
m a place called Zelow, which is near 
Lodz.  
Q: Okay.  Okay.  And your father?  
A: My father, in 
the same area.  

Q: Okay.  So she moved to where

A: It could be have been , but I don't know.  

Q: Were either of your parents storytellers? 
 For example, they told  you ab out their own 
childhood, their own lives, their own families?  

A: Not really.  I was    when the war starte

growing up before th e war?  
A: As I was growing up, yes.  
Q: Well, tell me a little bit about that life.  W h

A: Oh, probably  about
 three or four.  
Q: And same amount of churches?  
A: Churches, I don't know.  It had one large chur

was Catholic.  
Q: Uh huh.   
A: And that's all I rememb
er as of this town.  
Q: Was there any interaction between, you 
know, kids who were 
Jews and non Jews?  
Did you play  together?  Did you keep distance
 from one another?  Wh at kind of relations 
did you have?  

A: We had a very minor interaction.  
Q: Okay .   

A: Because they were hating Jews, you know.  
They were told that by the parents, by the 
grandparents.  

Q: And you saw that?  You ex
perienced that every day?  
A: I experienced it    
Q: Uh huh.   
A: a lot.  

Q: Can you tell me what    how?  

Interview with Jacques Ribons  
16

on and so  forth, go to Palestine.  We don't 
know how to explain that we were

Hitler comes."  This was before the war.  
Q: Oh, that's charming.   

A: Yes, it was.  
Q: Do you    did you know wh
o Hitler was or did people talk 
about Hitler or was he     
A: Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  We knew.  We weren'
t aware too much on wh
at he was like, what 
he was.  But we heard his name and the hating 
of Jews.  Because, also
, they had    they 
brought in    the Germans brought

A: Yeah.  

Interview with Jacques Ribons

 The Jewish did not wo

Q: Uh huh.   

A: They wouldn't even hire them even
 if they wanted to.  But, yes.  
Q: So how did Jews 
support themselves?  

Interview with Jacques Ribons  
18 
A: Well, my mother    my fath
er used to send things to sell.
  She went out and sold them 
and kept us going.  Made sure 
we dressed, we went to scho
ol.  We had to have special 
clothing like Catholic kids wear. 
 You know, we had to  wear certai
n    certain clothing     
Q: What kind of clothing?  
A: attached to the shirt or wh
atev er.  And th at was the kind of
 life.  And it wasn't the best, 
at least not in my family.  
Q: When  you went to school, at
 that time you were old enough  
  was she able to afford a 
pair of shoes for you?  
A: Hardly.  Hardly.  There wa
s a couple times that I wore her shoes because I didn't have 
any    any shoes to wear.  And th at wa
s already just before the war started.  

Q: You were already maybe, like, an 11 , 12 year old boy.   

A: Yes.  

Q: Did your younger brother and 
sister go to school?  Maybe yo
ur sister not, but did     
A: My brother did.  He was a year younger th
an I am even though he
 said two.  It was 
just one year.  

Q: Were you hungry at any tim
e?  Did you have enough to 
eat when  you were a kid?  
A: No.  There was alw ays potatoes.  There 
were always things th
at you could eat.  
Q: Uh huh.   

A: But it was enough food.  Wh en I 
say food, I mean, you know, basics.  
Q: That's right. Did you also have any chores 
that you had to do as 
you were growing up?  
A: Not mu ch , you know.  We didn't have 
a big house, so my  mo ther cleaned and 
whatever sh e did.  And we were out
 playing when we were kids.   

Interview with Jacques Ribons  
19 
Q: What did people say?  I mean, 
in this    in this small place 
   or big village, as you say, 
but, you know, not one that had    
were there people who had cars?  
A: Cars?   
Q: Uh huh.   

A: No.  The only th ing    person th at had a 
car that I remember wa
s a doctor in town, and 
he had a Mercedes.  
Q: Well, what a car.   
A: Yes, indeed.  

Q: And so that's a rarity.  Things like th
at were    did anybody own a radio?  
A: Yes.  Just people owned    and we had one.  

Q: You had one too?  

A: We had one too.  Wh en the Germans came
, they took it away and we turned it in.  
Q: So you had    they  told you to tu rn
 it in rather than coming to the house?  
A: Yes, to turn it in.  Everybody
 had to turn in.  You couldn't 
listen to the radio because if 
you picked up    in f
act, you could pick up Lo
ndon on most radios.  
Q: I see.   
A: And they  didn't want us to hear the news from London.  
Q: Had you ever    before the Germans ca
me, before the World 
War started, did you 
listen to the radio outside of    you know
, radio broadcasts that
 came from London or 
other places outside of Poland?  

A: Yes.  Yes.  We    like, one time we m
oved where my  father and mo ther were born.  
Q: Okay .   

Interview with Jacques Ribons  
20 
A: And it's closer to the Czech border.  
Q: To the Czech border?  
A: To the Czech border.  That was the other  
  I don't k n ow how far away it was.  It was 
quite a distance.  
Q: Okay .   

A: And we used to lis
ten to Radio Prague.  
Q: Uh huh.  In C
zech or in German?  
A: In German and Czech mostly.  
Q: So you could understand 
wh at they were saying?  
A: In a roundabout way, yes, because the Cz ech language is a Slavic language.  So you 

could understand some of it.  

Q: And was this about the time that Czechosl
ovakia was annexed to  Germany or before?  
A: Before and after.  
Q: Oh, really?   
A: Yeah.  But, you know, wh
en the Germans came in, they took all the radios.  You 
know, there was a death penalty, at least they sa
id, if they caught you to have a radio.  
Q: I guess what I'm trying to do is get a se
nse of how mu ch info
rmation came into the 
town .  How well informed were people about th
e larger historical, you know, things that 
were going on?  The political de
velopments that were going 
on?  Were people afraid or 
did it all seem very distant?  

A: No.  My father went through 
World War I when he was a kid.  
Q: Uh huh? 

Interview with Jacques Ribons  
21 
A: And so he was aware of th
e things of war.  And I heard him speak to his friends about 
the war.  And the consensus among them was it
's not going to  last very long.  Because 
they were aware there were planes and, you 
know, kinds of things that they can use to 
really    to do a job on anothe
r country.  So they were awar
e of things.  And I heard them 
speak and I was sort of aware what was going on myself.  
Q: So there was talk of war, but there wa
s also a confid en ce that you could beat 
somebody who invades your country?  

A: No.  

Q: There was no confidence?  
A: There was never any confidence b
ecause within the 
government    
Q: Okay .   
A: the Po lish government had some Germans in hi
gh office.  And so th
ey just    they 
actually dismantled the air force before the war started.  
Q: So you're saying there was some sort of sabotage from within?  
A: Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  And since it was   
 you know, th e last place I lived wh ich was 
Sulmierzyce, they    we had seen    you 
know, it was very close to the German border.  
Q: Okay .   

A: And we were aware but not to the extent th
at they came in with
, wh ich the blasts and 
the armament and wh atnot was going on.  So th
e war was wasn't going to  last very long.  
Nobody believed that it's going
 to last very long.  Because the Poles didn't have enough 
of a force to fight them off.  

Interview with Jacques Ribons  
22 
Q: I see. So it was in that sense that you   
 that there was talk that they were coming and 
they'll overrun us immediately?
  That sort of talk?  
A: Oh, yes.  There was no d
oubt about it.  And they did 
come in, and within a couple 
days they were all occupied, the whole area.  
Q: Tell me the first time that you    do yo
u rememb er where you were when you learned 
that the war had broken out?  
A: I was at home.  And it    and a Polish  
  Polish government called upon the people of 
age to come and join the military.  
Q: So there was an as an
nouncement over the radio?  
A: There was an announcement.  
And so my father left    
Q: Uh huh.   

A: to join    not join.  He had to    he was 
a    in the military befo
re.  It's been a couple 
years.  So, therefore, he was supposed to repo
rt to one of the military    I would say where 
register and they get you into the service.  

Q: One    yeah.   

A: So he left.  We didn't know wh ere he wa
s when the Germans came 
in.  And my father 
finally came home.  I don't know how many   
 how mu ch time.  I cannot rememb er the 
time element it took for him to co
me back.  He was    told the story that he was captured 
by the Germans and they held 
him.  And they were going 
to kill him and a whole bunch 
of people that they were going 
to kill.  So they had    my
 father had a gold Omega pocket 
watch, wh ich in those days was the style. 
 And one of the German guards saw it.  He 

Interview with Jacques Ribons  
23 
says, "If you give me this, I'll 
let you go."  So  he 
gave him the watch and he really let him 
go, and he came home.  
Q: I see.  S o  it was for his breath.   
A: Right.  Right.  That was just the beginning.  

Q: And when was the first time you saw an y 
   did you see German soldiers soon after 
that announcement came?  When did you  first have the war come to you?  
A: Within tw o days.  
Q: Okay .  What happened?  

A: The Germans moved in and they started k
illing people.  They ro
unded up the teachers, 
the priests, the rabbis, you know
, and they started killing them.  
Q: So this sounds like it was not based on wh
ether you were Jewish or not but based 
more if you were, like, a co
mmunity leader.  'C ause a priest or a rabbi would be a 
community leader.   
A: Right.  The elite.  The teachers, the doc
tors, the old    th
e educated people.  
Q: Okay.  And they were the ones w
ho were being arrest
ed and killed?  
A: Right, either killed or sent to Germa
ny to work.  I am not aware how many people 
they killed, but I know they did.  
Q: Did you see anything    did you 
see any violence on the streets?  
A: From time to time.  The occupation was br
oadcast and we didn't go out on the street 
until they entrenched th
emselves within the c
ity, within 
the town.  
Q: So you stayed at home.  When you fou
nd out that the war was on, your mo th er and 
your brother and your sister    you stayed inside the house?  

Interview with Jacques Ribons  
24 
A: Yes, absolutely.  
Q: And when did you 
first venture out?  
A: Right after.  Right    after a few days, we 
ventured out and    'cause we understood th e 

language.  

Q: Uh huh.   

A: The German people    the German sold
iers did not know who was Jewish and who was 
not.  

Q: They did not.  Okay.   

A: They did not.  
Q: Were you similar    you sa
id you mother was very religious
.  But in your dress and in 
your manners and so on, you were i
ndistinguishable from anybody else?  
A: Right.  Correct.  

Q: I see.  O k ay.  And what is the first 
thing that you noticed that was different?  
A: The food.  We didn't get 
much food.  It was rationed. 
 And the ruthlessness of the 
German occupiers.  They'd  just beat people 
up, beat kids up, beat
 grownups up and got 
them to work or picked them up in 
the street and took them to work.  

Q: So in other words, I get the sense that th
ere's really no fighting th
at actually happened; 
that there was no fight that was put up in
 your area.  They just ran in.   
A: Right.  

Q: They just overran the place?  
A: They just came in, and that was    that wa
s it.  They did not    there was no fight. There 

was not a soldier within miles.  A nd     

Interview with Jacques Ribons  
25 
Q: When  you say th ey came in
 then, does that mean no 
soldiers were there?  No 
Wehrmacht was there or     
A: Oh, yes.  The Wehrmacht came in, the SS
 right after that.  You know, I didn't know 
who was    an SS man is, but I di
d know what an Wehrmacht is.  
Q: Yeah.  Uh huh.  Bu
t no Polish soldiers?   
A: No.  They were gone.  

Q: They were all gone.  Yeah.   
A: 'C ause I never saw when the war started.  

Q: Yeah. So aside from    aside from rati
oning and, you said, th
e ruthlessness of the 
German soldiers, how else did life change?  

A: You had to stay in line for  
  to get a loaf of bread.  Everything was in short supply.  
There was no sugar, no nothing. 
 You know, that    whatev
er you had to do, you were 
rationed.  
Q: Was that across the board fo
r everybody or was this partic
ular targeted to the Jews?  
A: That, I don't know.  I would imagine it was across the board .  
Q: Okay .   
A: I don't know.  
Q: Was there    in those early days, was th
ere any discrimination ag
ainst the Jews that 
was harsher or more different than, 
let's say, the Polish population?  
A: They didn't know    they couldn't rec
ognize one from the other unless they wear the 
religious hair.  

Q: Right.   

Interview with Jacques Ribons  
26 
A: Otherwise they didn't know who th e Jews were.  
Q: Uh huh.   
A: They just didn't know.  And so, like, my
self, I was able to go anywhere even where 
the soldiers were and, you kn
ow, it was okay.  I was afraid, but I did go.  You know, I did 
see them, you know.  I didn't go near any Army
 installation or any  
  you know, anything 
like that.  I avoided that.  But, however, you kn
ow, they  didn't    they didn't  know who the 
Jews were or what they looked like unless 
they saw somebody w
ho was religious that 
they wore the    the garb, the ha
ir, the face, you know, and so on.  
Q: Well, when you would go, y
ou know, I take it out of, like, a child's curiosity to see 

what was    what are some of the things you saw?  
A: A lot of military around there.  There wa
s a lot of    they established the SS 
headquarters.  They took ov
er the police department.  
Q: Uh huh.   
A: So they had special German 
police.  They didn't  have any 
Polish.  They  just disbanded 
them.  And right wh en    I was about in fear 
because they were ruthless.  If they got ahold 
of somebody who did so mething,
 they either killed them or 
beat the hell out of them.  
Q: Did you see things like that?  
Did you see people being beaten?  
A: Oh, yes, a lot.  In fact, as we go, I 
have something I can tell you about my self, what 
transpired.  

Q: Okay .  We'll probably be there soon.  Te
ll me, what happened with your mo th er and 
your father?  How did they star
t    how did they  continue to
 put food on th e table?  I take 
it your father, when he came back, didn't le
ave again because, where would he go?  

Interview with Jacques Ribons  
27 
A: My father was gone for quite a wh
ile.  We didn't know wh ere he was.  
Q: Okay .   
A: But when he came back, he is  
  he was an educated person.  
Q: Okay .   
A: He spoke German.  

Q: Uh huh.   
A: Spoke clean Polish.  He 
spoke a little bit between.  He
 had knowledge of a lot of 
languages, you know; Russian, 
for instance.  'Cause his   his father was a Russian 
teacher.  

Q: Uh huh.  That's 
quite impressive    
A: Well     
Q: to know that many languages.   

A: Well, I was impressed with him, but
 I didn't like him, quite honestly.  
Q: Yeah.  Yeah.  I got     
A: So ab out    when he came back, he had to  start providing things.  He was able to go 

among th e Germans, talk to them, establish a Jewish city hall.  
Q: Okay .   
A: Which he was one of the people that wo
rked for them.  He was a mediator between 
the Germans and the Jewish community.  
Q: That's v ery responsible.   
A: Yes, it was responsible.  A
nd    but, you know, I     
Q: Was he a harsh man?  

Interview with Jacques Ribons  
28 
A: No, he wasn't.  He wasn't.  Only when
 I did something I shouldn't have done.  
Q: Was he distant then?  Decent but distant?  
A: I would say I don't think he
 was instant.  You know, I 
hugged him and, you know, he 
hugged me.  You know, so    but he was  
  he was not a warm 
father, but he was not 
distant.  
Q: I got that.  Okay.  So he became a me
diator, you know, between the Germans and th e 
Jewish community.   

A: Right.  

Q: And did I understand correctly that someti
mes he would just perform some services 
for the Germans and then he 
was able to put food on th e table because of that?  
A: He was able to do things 
   the food was rationed.  
Q: Okay .   

A: When  we have a situation like we had, 
when you have rations, 
you have    you have 
sometimes a preference if you know people.  

Q: Right.   

A: So th is was the kind of thing th at he di
d.  But he also bailed out people that were 
arrested.  
Q: Uh huh.   

A: He paid them off.  He did a lot of thin
gs that was for the Je
wish community.  The 
Jewish community apparently gave him th
ings, you know, for the 
Germans that were 
what he needed to bu
y the person out fo r mo ney or for ot
her things.  I don't know.  For 
gold.  I don't    I would imagine.  But he
 was a mediator between the Germans and the 

Interview with Jacques Ribons  
29 
Jewish community    the Jewish city hall th
at they fo rmed.  And, of course, they had 
people that they talked 
to and th at decided what to do, how to do it.  
Q: So did he come home and talk abou
t all of these things or did     
A: Never.  
Q: Never, huh?  

A: Never talked about anything.  I never kn
ew , but they do    did know th at he was a 
mediator because he used to bring home a lot 
of    a suitcase for the money.  And what 
did he need money fo r?  Only to  buy out or
 to buy off a German, you know, for     
Q: For somebody.   
A: For     
Q: For somebody 's life.   

A: Right.  

Q: Uh huh.  How long di
d you all live in this kind of situ
ation?  How long did this kind of 
limbo situation last?  

A: It was probably about a ye
ar and a half, maybe two.  

Q: So were you in a ghetto or were you just     
A: This was before the ghetto    
the time they formed that ghetto.  
Q: So in other words, for a year a
nd a half or almo st two years     
A: No, not quite.  No t two years.
  About a year, I would say.  
Q: Okay.  So it would be from September 
'39 to September '40, one could say?  
A: Yeah.  
Q: Yeah?  

Interview with Jacques Ribons  
30 
A: Yeah.  Something like that.  
Q: Something like that. Your    you still lived 
in your own home.  You 
were under this    
this occupation regime.   

A: Right.  

Q: It was bad but there was no sense yet that 
the Jews are going to be targeted for some 
special    sp ecial treatment in the negative se
nse?  It was    it was bad for everybody?  
A: We knew because there were a lot of k
illings taking place.  There was a lot of stuff 
that was going on.  Being as young as I was, 
I wasn't aware of a lot of things.  You have 
to rememb er, when the war st
arted, I was 12 years old.  
Q: Yeah.  Of course.  Of course.   

A: And I didn't    I wasn't aware 
of no one person wh at was going on.  
Q: Yeah.  Yeah.  It would be clues.  It's  fro
m your ch ild's memo ries that I'm trying to get 
this picture of what things were like.   
A: Yeah.  I understand.  
Q: Yeah.  So did life stay 
the same, pretty much, until th
e ghetto was formed or were 
there some incidents before
 it happened that     
A: There were some things befo re it happe
ned.  They took a lot of people out.  
Q: Tell me what those were.   
A: Well, they rounded up people.  
Q: Okay .   
A: And they  rounded up people 
and th ey just disappeared .  
Q: Uh huh.   

Interview with Jacques Ribons  
31 
A: And later on, we found out ther
e were labor camps, after the war.  
Q: So how did they  round them up?  Did th ey 
block off streets or did they go by a list of 
names?  How did this happen?   
A: Well, they had names.  The    some of 
the Polish people were   
 tu rned the Jews in, 
period.  

Q: I see.   
A: So    and they rounded  
  they rounded them up and they
 disappeared.  And they were 
brought back    for instance, a couple Jewish
 Polish soldiers, and they killed them because 
they did something that they di
dn't like.  So they 
killed them so everybody can see or that 
most people can see so that
 they wouldn't do it.  
Q: So these why like public executions?  
A: Sort of, yes.  Sort of.  But th
en    then after about a year or
 so    I'm not sure as to the 
time, you know, that     
Q: Sure.   
A: at the place.  They took a Polish    two 
streets and took the Polis
h people out of there 
and put the Jewish in there.  
And then they had    that is
 where the ghetto
 was formed.  
Q: And the ghetto was in the small to
wn  you were born a
nd grew up in?  
A: In the small town, yes.  Another part of to
wn where I used to live or another a part of 
what is called, quote, downtown area.  
Q: Okay .  Okay .  And so did you have
 to move into those two streets?  
A: Yes.  Yes.  We had to move in.  We ha
d to have one room.  We shared a place with 
another family.  

Interview with Jacques Ribons  
32 
Q: Was there indoor plumbing?  
A: You know, I do not recall that.  
Q: Okay .   
A: The mo st people didn't have it.  Th
is was a newer house.  I don't think so.  
Q: Okay .   

A: I don't think so.  And th ey fo rmed a ghetto.  
Q: Before they formed the ghe
tto, were you going to school 
or was school suspended?  
A: School was suspended for the Jewish kids.  
Q: Okay .  And wh at about the Polish kids? 
A: The Polish kids had school, ye
s.  They had schools for them.  
Q: Okay.  So during the day,
 you just hung out at home?  
A: Yeah.  
Q: Uh huh.   
A: I mean, what    where can you go?   
Q: Exactly.   

A: No place to go.  
Q: And your father was with you 
when  you moved in to the ghetto?  
A: Yes.  

Q: Okay .   
A: He was with us.  And moved into one ro om.  There was five of us.  
Q: Oh, my.   

Interview with Jacques Ribons  
33 
A: And we had a little kitchen, 
you know, a small little kitchen.
  But that was the extent 
of it.  
Q: Uh huh.   
A: And so th e ghetto, when  they
 took out people, like 
myself    I was, 
like, again, 12, 13 
years old at that time.  An
d they put me to work.  
Q: And what was    what
 did you have to do?  
A: My job was    I wa
s an electric welder.  
Q: An electric welder?  

A: Welder.  They showed 
me how to do it and I was 
welding the wheelbarrows.  
Q: You were welding wheelbarrows? 

A: Right.  So they    they
 produced    they have that 
iron now.  They had the comp any 
there and they hired    th
ey got the Jewish kids.  
Q: Uh huh.   
A: Or the Jewish people, you know, th
at were working and producing th em.  
Q: Well, did you get any kind of 
pay fo r this?  Any kind of     
A: Oh, no.  

Q: No.  So this was   
 this was forced labor?  
A: It was forced labor, absolutely.  
Q: And no food?  
A: They didn't give us any food.  The fo od 
was from the house, what
ever you could get.  
Q: And no    and no ability to say no?  
A: That's correct.  Because if you refu
sed, you weren't around very  long.  

Interview with Jacques Ribons  
34 
Q: Yeah.  What kind of job di
d your father do?  Was he 
continuing being a me diator?  
A: Yes.  He was a med iator to
 the very end of the ghetto.  
Q: And what did your mo ther do?  
A: Not much.  She tried to provide for us.  
She tried to keep us fed.  Didn't do mu ch.  
There was no    noth ing that you can do.  You 
were packed like herrings
 into a small area.  
Q: Did you    when you went
 to work in the morning, di
d you leave the ghetto area?  
A: They left    we left    when we 
left the ghetto area, we were under guards.  
Q: I see.   

A: They had some Jewish    what they call kapos or what
ever and the Germans.  They 
walked with us to 
the place of work.  
Q: And the Jewish kapos    are these people 
that you reco gnized and knew or were they 
strangers?  

A: No; people that we knew.  It wasn 't that 
big of a town that we didn't know people, you 
know, but    yeah
, we knew them.  
Q: And were they    were they harsh?  Were they     

A: No.  They just    you know, kids are kids
 everywhere.  They tried to get out of line.  
Q: That's true.   

A: They put them back, you know.
  We didn't realize the enor
mity of this whole thing.  
Q: Yeah.   
A: So    but I    I don't know how to  explai
n this.  We used to go
 to work  every mo rning 
and come home in the evening, and that was 
going on for quite a while.  And a little bit at 
the time, th ey took the Je
ws and shipped th em out.  

Interview with Jacques Ribons  
35 
Q: That's w h en the ghe
tto gets liquidated?  
A: Right, a little bit at a time.  
Q: A little bit at a time.  Okay.   
A: Right.  

Q: Okay.  But    and was that something ev
erybody noticed, that a
nother group was gone 
and another group is gone?  
A: Oh, yeah.  They    
what you call    they 
rounded up all the Jews.  
Q: Uh huh.   
A: And they  picked  out whoeve
r they wanted to pick out to
 send to th e gas chambers or 
prison camps or such, you know.  

Q: And, again, how was this done when  it wa
s a little bit at a time?  Was it by a list or 
was it you were called to a square and then  th
ey would say every te
nth person?  How did 
those people who get rounded up     
A: You were called to a square.  Everybody had 
to appear.  And th ey picked  out    I don't 
know how they went
 ab out pick ing out    picking out people.  I have no idea.  And    but 
they did.  Families    let's sa
y, mother and father or mother and the kids, and    I don't 

know how they went 
about doing it.  And my father
 occasionally was able to get 
somebody back from what
 they picked out by
 buying them off.  
Q: I see.  Were there more people who we
re doing th e same thing as your father was 
doing as a mediator?  
A: Not to my knowledge.  Not to my kn
owledge.  At least I didn't know any.  

Interview with Jacques Ribons  
36 
Q: Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, you to ld  me earlier that there was a story you had to  tell me.  It 
was when  I was asking about did you see peop le being beaten up, did you see people    
you know, violence in the stre
ets.  And can you tell me wh
at    what happened?  
A: There was violence.  There was a German
 population that they
 moved in an d they 
used to beat up the Jewish ki
ds or the Jewish people.  
Q: So it was civilians who wo
uld do this, not just Army?  
A: Civilians and occasionally they had the SS 
going through there.  
And, you know, they 
picked up people.  They    
you know, I cannot explain    th
ey used  to beat them up, and 
sometimes they picked th
em up and killed them.  

Q: Did you see corpse
s in the stre ets?  
A: Not at the time that I was 
in the ghetto.  I saw corpses 
from starvation.  Occasionally, 
yes, I did see, but not many.  
Q: Uh huh.   
A: They didn't do it in pub
lic view, so to speak.  
Q: Except for those two Po
lish Jewish soldiers.   
A: Two Polish Jewish soldiers
; brought them in because th
ey called the German soldier 
and    I don't know what happened.
  And they brought them in.   
It was a Jewish restaurant before the ghetto.  
And they used to    
the Jewish people used 
to go there to this    what 
they call a restaurant.  And they
 brought in this Jewish Polish 
soldier that he was imprisoned.  He was a PO
W.  They  brought him in to explain wh at 
happened , what he did.  And th
at was the end of him.  After 
that, we didn't  hear of him 
anymore.  

Interview with Jacques Ribons  
37 
Q: I see.  I see.   
A: So logically speaking, knowing 
wh at I know, he didn't make it.  
Q: Okay.  So but you didn't 
see this public execution?  
A: No.  

Q: Remember, you said that there were a coup
le who were executed publicly.  So     
A: I saw that.  
Q: You saw it?  
A: Yes.  But I saw within the town.  And th
ey did something, and I don't know what they  
did.  And they just shot them.  
Q: Yeah.  That's an awful lot of vi
olence for a 13 year old to see.  
A: Hm, yeah.  It was a bad time.  
Q: Yeah.  Yeah.  Did you yo
urself ever get beat up?  
A: No, not really.  You know, I 
got hit a couple times across my
 back.  But that's about it, 
you know.  

Q: Okay.  Were there    I rememb er in th
e interview that we did in Los Angeles, you 
know, where    where we were only able to 
speak with  you fo r a short amount of time    
A: Correct.  

Q: you did mention someth
ing about the son of the German police chief.   
A: Oh, yes.  
Q: What was that about?  
A: Well, we only were a
llowed to walk on one 
side of the street.  
Q: Okay .   

Interview with Jacques Ribons  
38 
A: The other side was for Aryans 
only.  So here this kid

captain or something and th ey were looking for me.   

Q: Oh, my goodness.   
A: And I was hiding.  Well, after a while th

okay.  Bu t, you know, I guess if

they just took
 them away.  
That was the end of them; never heard from them ag

different town.  Are you there?   

Q: I'm here, but I'm kind of shocked.  
So he kind of abandoned his family?  
A: So to  speak, yes.  And    because he
 knew the end result.  He really did.  
Q: I see.

to go.  If we wait days, they catch us, they 
kill us.  There's no    there was no question 
about that.  

Q: Yeah.  Yeah.

A: Yes, a hard decision to make.  
Q: Yeah.

by the authorities?  
A: No.  We didn't have much of a choice.  We 
   either that or I    I couldn't go with my 
mother.  

Interview with Jacques Ribons

Q: Okay.  Okay.  So that was 
the    that was the situation 
that you found yourself in.   
A: Right.  My brother.  My br
other was little and I    you know, we were really surprised 
that he was able to do th at.  And we went 
to that point, the Blechhammer, we found a lot 
of people from our own town.  

Q: Really?  
A: Yes.  And so , you know, again, we worked
.  And some people died.  They had people 
that smoked, for instance.  And th
ey had    everybody 
had to go out to the 
   to the    I 
don't know the word .  

Q: Hello?  Hello?

A: And the pentplas.  
Q: In the pentplas.   
A: And they  did some hanging of the people 
that committed what th
ey called a crime like 
smoking, like doing something that they didn'
t want to show the people that if you 
commit anything, we're going to do th at 
to you.  And they
 did hanging.  
Q: So you would be forced
 to see these things?  
A: And they  hung a 15 year old boy 
who smoked, who work ed with me.  

Interview with Jacques Ribons  
51 
Q: Oh.   
A: Because he smoked, they hung him.  So an
yhow, we were there fo
r almost two years.  
Q: Tell me, what kind of
 wo rk did you do?  
A: The place that we worked wa
s a conglomerate of all k inds 
of things.  They produced 
oil, coal    extract oil from 
coal, fuel.  They    cement pi
pes all over the place.  They used 
to bomb this place often.  I don't know chemi
cals they used to produce there.  Our job 
unloading cement    bags of cement, mixing 
cement.  These are, you know, things that 
they can hide    like, bunkers, we used to
 do.  And wh en they bomb ed , they couldn't 
penetrate the bunkers. 
Q: So you were ther
e from 1942 to  1944?  
A: Something like th at, you know.  I    you lose track of time.  

Q: Of course.  Of course.  Of course.  But 
do you rememb er if you got there in the fall or 
in the winter?  Do you reme mb
er the time of year that it 
was that you finally ended up 
there?  

A: Well, let me put it to you this way:  Wh
at I remember that we were picking fruit at 
home, whatever we can find.  And 
around that time of the year.  
Q: Okay .  So  it could have been harv
est time?  Could it have been     
A: Harvest, yes.  

Q: And tell me     
A: Almost two years.  
Q: It mu st have been hell on earth.   

A: Well, it was.  

Interview with Jacques Ribons  
52 
Q: What did you eat?  What did they give you to eat?  
A: They gave us spinach that 
they had, coal or little pebbles.  They gave us soup.  I don't 
know wh at it was made out of, but people used to swell, you know, b
ecause they ate that 
soup.  

Q: Uh huh.   

A: And I ate two slices of bread a day.  
Q: Did a lot of people die just natura
lly because of exhaustion and hunger?  
A: Yes, very much so.  I don 't know how many
.  You know, there's a 
couple people that I 
knew.  One person in  particular that I knew 
ran away from prison.  He was from Poland.  

Q: Uh huh.   
A: He went back to Pola
nd and he had no place to go.
  He finally came back.  
Q: He came back to the concentration camp?  

A: Yes.  
Q: To the labor camp.  Excuse me.   
A: So when he came back, the 
Germans let him run, told him 
to run.  And they used the 
German shepherds.  And the only
 thing that I heard is a little scream, and that was the end 
of that person.  

Q: Oh, my  gosh.   

A: So th is goes to show you cruelty of    
Q: Yeah.   
A: these people.  

Interview with Jacques Ribons  
53 
Q: Tell me, did your brother and you stay toge
ther?  Were you able to stay together 
during th is time?  
A: Yes.  
Q: What was     

A: We kind of took care of each other.  

Q: Do you think that    y
eah, how do you    how do you 
explain th at you surv ived?  
A: Well, we ate what they gave us, which 
was very little.  Occasionally, the accountant 
when  we walked to work    a Yiddish POW contingent    

Q: I see.   
A: once in a while would send us some brea
d, threw it at us.  ____________. We made 
the best of it.  We survived. 
 That was the main thing:  Su
rvival.  And so metimes at work, 
we had a guard that was very ol
d that was probably in  his late 
60s or mid 60s that he used 
to give us some soup from tim
e to time, a German guard.  
Q: Really?  

A: Yes.  And he was from the Wehrmacht. 
 And he was from Austria, an Austrian.  
Q: He was Austrian rather than
 from Germany pr
oper itself?  
A: Yes.  He was from Austria. 
 And he kind of    you know, 
he used to say to us, "Just 
hang in there.  It's al
most over.  Hang in th ere."  'C ause, you 
know, he used to     he told us 
about the invasion of No
rmandy, for instance.  
Q: Did he?  

A: Yes.  It was amazin g .  I 
never could believe it, you know
.  He saw us walk out, thro w 
us a little bit, you know, the be
st he could, you know.  

Interview with Jacques Ribons  
54 
Q: So you met     
A: Anything else than what I just 
told you, you know 
____________________.   
Q: But it's so unusual to here    have a 
guard in the forced labor camp do that.   
A: Yes, it probably was.  And    but deci
ded, you know, he co
uldn't work  anymore 
anyway because he
 was evacuated.  
Q: But let's just stay those two years in this
 camp.  Tell me a little
 bit about the barracks 
that you    that you lived  in and about the 
daily routine and, you kn
ow, how large it was.  
And where was it located?  Was it 
in Poland or in Germany?  
A: You know, I don't really know.  I ca
n tell you this:  I went back there.  
Q: Oh, did you?  
A: Recently, with Lisa.  

Q: Uh huh.  With your daughter.   

A: Right.  And we came out to this partic
ular camp where I was.  I think it was annexed 
by the Germans.  

Q: So you th ink it was a part of 
Poland that had been  annexed?  
A: Annexed by the Germans.  Because my  home town  was annexed by the Germans. 
They called it Oberschlesian.  
Q: Yeah.  Yeah.   

A: So    because, you know, pr
imarily the industry was coal.  
Q: Yeah.   

A: Were the coal mines.  So I guess they need
ed coal to produce some
thing there, so    
where was I? 

Interview with Jacques Ribons

nk th ey co uld see through it. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: But nothing was said. 

Q: S o , tell me, was i t t h e same ca mp  co mma
ndants the entire time or was there a change? 
A: You know, I really don't know
.  I could not, I could not 
tell you, really, whether it was 
the same commandant or not but he was -- 
I know afterwards -- you know, there were 
also women which was used by 
the SS, by the military there. 
Q: I was going ask you --  
A: There was women. 

Q: I was going to ask you were
 there any women in the camp. 
A: Yes, Jewish women.  Their husbands were
 prisoners.  And they used them for their 
own use. 

Q: I see.  I see.   

Interview with Jacques Ribons  
57 
A: And so they -- we were th
ere about, I guess, maybe a ye
ar, maybe not, the SS took 
over.  And they came in and gave us concen tr
ation camp  clothing.  And they  put numb ers 
on us. 
Q: So you were tattooed? 

A: I was tattooed, yes. 

Q: What's  your number? 
A: 178212. 
Q: 178212. 

A: Yes. 
Q: Did that mean that there were -- you we
re -- there were at least 17,212 prisoners? 
A: Probably .  I don't, I really don't know.  
I could not account for anything, you know.  
Really, I can only tell you what Isaw and what transpired there. 
Q: Were the women ev er used for anything else
?  I me an, did th ey ever have actual jobs 
or was it they --  

A: No. 

Q: -- they were prostituted? 
A: They were prostituted.  That's  -- I 
wouldn't -- I didn't want
 to use that term. 
Q: I know, I know.  But it -- 
A: They had husbands there.
  That's  the irony of it. 
Q: Well, it's a tragedy and a catastrophe all the way around. 

A: Right.  Then  they  gave us the con
centration camp  clothing and I was tattooed. 
Q: Yeah. 

Interview with Jacques Ribons  
58 
A: And we were part of Auschwitz, became part of Auschwitz. 
Q: Oh, really?  So then  you became one of the subcamps of Au schwitz. 
A: Right. 
Q: Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  And so you -- did your
 treatment change?  Did the food change? 
A: The food was the same.  There were -- only 
thing, you know, they 
used to -- they got 
people, the prisoners, to play mu sic as we ma rched out and as we came in. 
Q: Oh, my goodness. 
A: You know, there was people that were 
-- you know, they had pe
ople, like Jews from 
Holland, Jews from France. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Jews from just about everywhere.  The Po lish Jews were, I think, the predominant, 

you know, people, so.  But -- 

Q: Do you reme mb er the kind of 
music they were 
forced to play? 
A: March music. 

Q: Marching music. 

A: Yes.  And, you know -- 
Q: Was there anybody, in addition to that 
old guard , was there anyb
ody who behaved in a 
mo re humane way to wards the prisoners amongs
t the guards or the, you know, the army  
or even the SS or were 
they all pretty brutal? 
A: I wouldn't say -- only if they
 think you committed a crime. 
Q: Okay . 

A: Like smoking. 

Interview with Jacques Ribons  
59 
Q: Right. 
A: Like stealing.  Things, you know, of that nature. 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: They put you up on the gallo
ws so everybody can watch. 
 And we watched quite a bit 
of that. 

Q: Oh, my dear. 
 Oh, my dear. 
A: Can you hear me? 

Q: I can hear you.  I can hear you.  Again,
 but I 'm just speechless 
because I'm trying to 
imagine a young kid -- I mean, 
for anybody this would be, th
is would be horrifying but 
particularly for young teenage 
boys, you know, young teenagers. 
A: There was no _________. 

Q: Excuse me? 

A: They took us out.  We had 
to watch while they do it.   
Q: Yeah. 

A: We were beaten up by them but it's  so
me thing -- I don't know what I did.  I don't 
reme mb er.  I was hit a couple times, you know. 
 They  hit me over the back, over my  rear 
end, you know, and -- 

Q: And your brother too? 

A: My brother, basically, no. 
Q: Okay . 

Interview with Jacques Ribons  
60 
A: He was with me.  I tried to protect him 
the best I could.  And I did, you know.  I 
couldn't do mu ch for him, you know, except we ki
nd of were very close together.  He -- I 
slept in the middle bunk and 
he slept in the down bunk. 
Q: Uh-huh.  On the bottom bunk. 

A: The bottom bunk.  And the 
third person, I don't rememb er who it was.  You know, 
you, you were only fighting for your own life, so, you know. 
Q: Did he do the same
 work  that you did? 
A: Yes.  He was a year younger than me.  
And he was very skinny.  He was a little guy, 
period. 

Q: Uh-huh. 
A: And I had people from my  hometown
, you know, kids lik
e my self fro m my  
hometown.  Three sets of brot
hers, in fact, that survived. 
Q: Three sets of brothers. 
A: Three set of brothers. 
Q: Wow. 

A: Myself and my  brother.  Another couple
, which they -- I don't know whether they'r e 
still alive.  They were their friends.  We had 
another set of brothers 
that were very close 
to the -- one of the brothers
 was a _________.  He was ve
ry close friends with Elie 
Wiesel.   
Q: I see.  A nd you were in that camp. 
A: Yes.  He was a scientist who worked  fo
r Brooklyn -- the naval yard and died of 
cancer. 

Interview with Jacques Ribons  
61 
Q: So you kept in touch 
with them after the war. 
A: Yes.  In a roundabout way, yes, yes.  
Elie Wiesel I haven't se
en for -- since we got 
here.  Since we left Europe, in fact. 
Q: But was he in this camp with you? 

A: No. 

Q: No. 
A: I met him in Buchenwald. 
Q: So were you transf
erred at some point? 

A: Yes, we were transferred.  
Let me, let me b
ack up a little bit. 
Q: Yeah, let's go back to the story. 

A: Continue the story. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: We were taken out and th
e Russian army came close. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: We were taken out and -- to walk.  So we
 started walking.  We slept outdoors.  And 

this was, mind you, during the wi
nter season and it was snowing. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: We kept walking.  Probably  half the peop
le didn't make it.  Either froze to death or 
didn't  take care of sufficiently.  
I did the best I could.  I wash
ed myself with snow.  I told 
my  brother to do the same because you get 
your blood going.  And the walk, we walked 
and walked for probably a 
couple weeks, maybe more. 
Q: My goodness. 

Interview with Jacques Ribons  
62 
A: Time was not of essence. 
Q: Yeah, of course.   
A: We tried, you know, we tried to run into th
e homes.  We slept in barns.  From time to 
time -- we finally, after two, three week
s, we got to a place called Gross-Rosen. 
Q: Gross-Rosen, okay. 
A: It was sort of, I think, a death camp.  They
 packed us in in barra
cks.  And, I mean, we 
were packed.  The place was fillin g up almost.  
And I didn't think we 
were going to make 
it from there.  But they took us
 from there.  W e were there about a week or two weeks.  
Again, time wasn't -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- important anyhow.  And they  took us and 
packed us on 
open freight trains to Gross-
Rosen.  Now, come to find out, after the war wh
en I went back with 
Lisa, that it -- they 
produced marble in that ar
ea.  They were digging fo r marble.  And the place was 
surrounded but you -- the people outside could no
t look in.  No access 
to it.  So nobody 
knew wh at was going on in  that prison camp .   

They  took us.  Anyhow, they put
 us on freight trains.   
Q: Okay . 

A: And they transported us to Weimar. 

Q: Right.  And Buchen wald  
is really close to Weimar. 
A: Buchenwald is very close to Weimar.  Well,
 lo and behold, there were air raids.  And 
unfortunately, the U.S. Army  didn't know, th
ey  of course didn't  know who was down  
there and they bomb
ed that train -- 

Interview with Jacques Ribons  
63 
Q: Oh.  My goodness. 
A: -- unfortunately.  An yhow, a lot of people pa
ssed at that time.  A
nd then th ey took us 
into Weimar to Buchenwald. 

Q: So those that survived were taken to Buchenwald. 

A: Buchenwald, right. 

Q: Okay . 
A: And we were with kids, with other kids. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: We had two or three barracks or four ba
rracks.  I don't -- I'm 
not -- don't rememb er 
which, you know.  And we were on th
e, I guess on the famous barracks, 66. 
Q: Uh-huh.  What makes them famous? 

A: I don't know.  I think everybody that I 
heard about, they were talking about barracks 
66. 
Q: Huh.  Okay. 
A: _________ older kids.  
Maybe that was the reason. 
Q: Okay . 
A: And anyhow, they  gave us a little bit of
 soup a day and they to ok us from _________ 
out, to march us out.  Then put us back.  We
 were supposed to go 
down for a while.  And 
I got so sick that I really be
gged them to take me away.  
I had, unfortunately, diarrhea so 
bad -- 
Q: Oh, dear.   

A: -- I could no longer take it. 

Interview with Jacques Ribons  
64 
Q: Oh, dear. 
A: So they took me in
to a -- I'm shaky.  They took me into
 a barrack with a lot of, a lot of 
kids.  I think -- what I saw was mostly kids. 

Q: Was it an infirmary or what should have been an infirmary? 

A: It was barracks set up fo r that purpose.  I 
don't know -- I can tell 
you one thing.  They  
took so many people out every da
y and they  didn't  come  back. 
Q: Oh, my goodnesses. 

A: After the war, I found out they were giving
 them -- they were killing them by giving 
them an injection. 
Q: I see. 
A: Now, what happened to me is I kind of
 lucked out.  There wa
s a man that came up to 
me that was working there.  Whether he was 
Jewish or not, I don't know.  Wh ether he 
was a doctor, I don't know.  So  he came, of all 
the kids, he came  up to me and he said, 
"How old are you?"  I said, "Sixteen."  He sa
ys, "You have a long lif
e ahead of you.  Let 
me see what I can do for you." 

Q: Oh, my goodness.  
So what did he do? 
A: Well, let me get my  compos
ure.  I'm just, I'm choking. 
Q: Shall we pause for a little bit? 

A: Please. 
Q: Okay .  I'm going to pause. 
A: Just take a few minutes. 

Q: Okay.  I'll pause.   

Interview with Jacques Ribons  
65 
(Pause) 
Q: Okay.  This is a continuation of the 
United States Holocaust Memorial Museum 
interview with Mr. Jacques Ribo
ns.  Okay.  I'm back.  So 
he came -- I was asking you, 
what did this man do to help save you? 

A: I don't rememb er if he was a doctor or not
.  But anyhow, he says
, "I'm  going to see 
what I can do fo r you." 
Q: Okay . 
A: He said, "Let me take your stool." 

Q: Yeah. 
A: Which he took my  stool and he took it.  Wh
erever he to ok it, I don't know.  He came 
back a few days later, which I was lucky they
 didn't put me into that room where -- 
Q: Yeah. 
A: He says, "I think I can help you."  So
 he took me out and put me on a two-wh eel 
transportation th ing, you know. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Like a wheelbarrow.  And he took me out.
  They took me to a hospital.  I guess -- 
there were beds there, b
unks, and things like that. 
Q: Within 
B u ch enw a ld ? 

A: It was in Buchenwald. 
Q: It was -- 
A: They had other prisoners th
ere, international prisoners. 
Q: I see. 

Interview with Jacques Ribons  
66 
A: So they used these hospital 
primarily for non-Jews, you know. 
Q: Okay . 
A: Occasionally they did have, like my
self, they took me
 in there.   
In comes a guy with  an injection.  It looked to
 me like it was a foot long.  He gave me an 
injection.  He says, "That will make you feel 
better."  And they started giving me, I forgot 
what they call this, like a very plain cereal that you cook. 
Q: Oh.  Could it have been, like, farina or
 cream of wheat?  I 
mean, whatever --  
A: Cream of wheat. 
Q:-- the generic name would be? 
A: Cream of -- this is 
what they fed me.   
Q: Okay . 
A: And I gained a little weight.  And I got news
 out to my brother, my brother was in the 
barracks, 66, to see whether he can come.  An
d I gave him some food.  And th ey put me 
back, sort of, together. 

Q: Uh-huh.  How lo ng did you stay 
there in that room with those -- 
A: I couldn't even tell you.   
Q: Okay . 
A: I don't know.  When I got a little better, th
ey sent me back to 
the barracks.  And by 
that time, the closing of the 
war was just about beginning. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: So we were there, I don't know how long
 I was still there, and the war was coming to  
an end. 

Interview with Jacques Ribons  
67 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: All of a sudden -- we used to hear the ar tillery from far away.  
It was -- I forgot the 
word for this.  Erfurt.  It
 was called Erfurt, the town. 
Q: Erfurt is a town, yes, a small city. 

A: Erfurt, we used to h
ear the artillery.  They were firing across to Weimar. 
Q: That's right. 
A: And so we used to hear 
the cannons.  And all of a sudden, we had a plane that came 
in, a tank that came in with U.S. soldiers.  
This was quite a while later.  And they took 
out people.  They  took them out 
and never heard from them again. 
Q: So this is a tank, a German tank. 
A: No. 

Q: This is a U.S. tank? 

A: No, it was -- yeah, it was made in th
e -- I was there for quite a while longer. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And then  when th e war was coming to an e
nd, they  broke through the lines, I suppose, 
from Erfurt --  
Q: Yeah. 
A: -- the U.S. military, the Third Army move
d up and took over Weimar and they came 
in to us. 
Q: So, in other words, the Americ
ans liberated you 
in Buchenwald. 

Interview with Jacques Ribons  
68 
A: The Americans liberated us in Buch enwald
, yes.  But it took -- it's a longer story than  
that because they used to take
 out people out of the prison 
camp, either kill them or get 
rid of them.  I don't know what they did with them. 
Q: When  you're talking about they  took th em out, who took them out? 

A: The Germans took th em out. 

Q: That's w h at I thought. 
 Okay.  So the Germans --  
A: Before the U.S. came, the U.S. Army. 

Q: Before they came. 

A: Before they came. 
Q: Yeah, yeah. 
A: They took out, in fact, one of them, a pers
on, my hometown, their fa
ther th ey took out.  
But he was _________.  For so
me reason or another, they kept the kids intact.  The 
prisoners themselves w ere political prisoners, a 
lot of them.  They made sure that these 
kids, these Jewish kids, that they kept
 in barracks 66, 64,
 65 got maintained. 
Q: Really? 

A: They took, they sort of to
ok care of them.  I found out 
later.  I didn't know that.  And 
so the U.S. Army moved in and here we were. 

Q: What was that like?  My God, three, almo
st three years then that you had been in the 
camp system, that you had been
 under such  conditions.  And all of a sudden, these GIs 
appear. 
A: The GIs, yeah.  Let me just -- 

Q: We can stop.  Hang on. 

Interview with Jacques Ribons  
69 
A: Okay . 
(Pause) 
Q: Okay.  They came in. 
A: They came in.  There were mostly Jewish
 kids.  And I understand, from what I heard 
and what I saw, was some non-Jewish 
kids too among the Jewish kids.   
Q: I see. 
A: And they took over.  They fe
d us.  Put us, really, back toge
ther to help and the really, 
whoever with tuberculosis, with TB -- 
Q: Yeah. 
A: -- was sent to Switzerland, to Sweden, to 
Germany in to the mountains.  And th ey took 
a group of kids that the Fr
ench government okayed  it a
nd they to ok us to France. 
Q: So you went to France? 
A: Yes. 
Q: With your brother? 
A: One brother and -- there was about th
ree sets of brothers the same way. 
Q: Who also went to France. 
A: _________.  Yes. 
Q: How did you get there? 

A: They took us by train. 
Q: They took you by train. 
A: Yeah.  When  the U.S. Ar
my  moved in , they had a rabbi
 that came over and took th e 
Jewish kids.  And so me of them were non-Je
wish.  And they had a segment of the kids 

Interview with Jacques Ribons  
70 
that they sent to France, 
they sent them to Switzerland, to England.  You know, 
whichever country took them in. 
Q: Okay.  So you 
end up in France. 
A: I end up in France. 
Q: Before we go to France, 
what was in France, tell me, 
when you were in Buchenwald 
and right before the Americans come, what 
happened  with the German guards and the 
German authorities? 
A: Well, the German authority were -- for in
stance, you know, I was sick.  I came out of 
the hospital and I was laying there on one of
 the bunks, so to 
speak, like a shelf. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: And there was a window and glass and I us
ed to, I watched the main road.  All of a 
sudden I saw tanks moving up in
 that glass.  It was like a mirror reflection in the glass.  
And I knew the U.S. Army is moving in.  So 
when they came in, th ey
 took the kids.  And 
the rabbis, the priests, th
ey gave them, you know -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- food.  They gave them medicine.  And so
me of them had to be hospitalized and they  
brought us back sort of together. 

Q: Yes. 

A: And, you know, back to health, so to speak.
  And they sorted out 
kids to go to France, 
it had to do with their health also, to Engl
and, and to some other countries, you know, 

that they -- I don't know all the countries that the kids went to, so. 

Q: Yes. 

Interview with Jacques Ribons  
71 
A: But they spread them out.  Each co
untry  took in so  many kids, you know. 
Q: But I was backing up to ask you wh at had 
happened  to  all of the German guards.  Did 
they disappear?  Were they a
rrested?  Did they run away? 
A: The Germans had jump
ed off the towers --  
Q: Pardon? 
A: -- during that because -- the guard towers. 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: And they  started running. 

Q: I see. 
A: If the GIs came up on one of th
em, they killed them, you know. 
Q: Got it. 
A: They were running away from the prison, 
period.  And I guess, I don't know who they  
caught, the main commandant was caught by th
e U.S. Army .  The main people that were 
caught, the same thing.  They  had sort of 
a mi ni revolution within  that prison because 
there were a lot of Germans th
at worked in that 
prison also that were there for many 
years. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Germans that were not Nazis.   

Q: That's right.  Political prisoners.  
There were a lot of political prisoners. 
A: Political prisoners that were put in there. 

Q: Yeah.  And so -- 

A: But they're the ones primarily that run that prison. 

Interview with Jacques Ribons  
72 
Q: Yeah.  Did -- 
A: Had access to armament.  There was a mu nition factory --  
Q: Yeah. 
A: -- and an  armament factory in one of the 
prisons down th e road. 
 And th ey had a man 
over there that _________
 worked in that prison, the mun
ition factory.  And one of them 
was Leon Blum. 
Q: Really?  Well, I --  
A: I don't know wh ether he survived or not. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: But he was one of the people that was 
in that.  But _________ prison, the armament. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: And the U.S. Air Force bombed it.  And af
ter that, I don't know wh at happened to the 
people. 
Q: Yeah.  Yeah.  So you end up
 in Paris.  I mean, excuse me, in France.  Was it Paris or 
was it somewhere else? 
A: Yeah, they dispersed all the kids. 
Q: Excuse me? 
A: They dispersed the kids. 

Q: Okay . 
A: Some of them went into _________. 
Q: Yeah. 

Interview with Jacques Ribons  
73 
A: Others went into  a religious home.  
They had -- they divided them, you know, in 
different homes. 
Q: Okay . 
A: Then they had, I want to 
say they had homes for the French
 kids also there.  So they 
put them together. 

Q: That's right. 
A: Jewish kids that had, you 
know, that survived the war. 
Q: Okay . 

A: The French kids.  One of 
my friends -- and the OSE took over.  I don 't know whether 
you're familiar with the OSE. 

Q: Well, tell me about it.  What is it? 

A: OSE was an organization that was from, 
I guess -- a French organization wh ich took 
care of the kids to make sure they go to  school
 and some of them had trades and they paid 
for the education. 

Q: Was it a government organization? 

A: No, no. 
Q: Was it a Jewish organization? 
A: It was a Jewish organization. 

Q: Okay .

millionaire.   
Q: Wow.  And what about you?  When you got 
off the train, what kind of a place were 
you -- 

A: I went into a Jewish religious situation. 
Q: Okay . 
A: Even though I wasn't relig
ious, I went into that home. 
Q: Okay . 
A: I don't know.  I don't know what I was th
inking.  And I started going to  school a little 
bit and then I returned to 
the United States in 1947. 
Q: So you were in France for, 
let 's say, almo st two years? 
A: Almost. 

Q: Did you learn -- 
A: I would say a year and a half.  April, in

of the father that they 
took out and disappeared . 
Q: That's right.  That's right

Interview with Jacques Ribons  
75 
A: Yes, yes.  He was with me all along. 
Q: Okay . 
A: He was with me --

A: Pardon me? 

Q: He was in the same 
religious family, then? 
A: Yeah.  It wasn't a fa
mily.  It was a home -- 
Q: It was a home.  Excuse me.  U h -huh.

Q: I see. 

A: -- you know, for the kids to stay there. 

Q: Yeah.  The Ro
thschilds, yeah. 
A: And they had Jewish religion, Jewish food

know.  And, like, again, like Elie
 Wiesel was there also with us. 
Q: Oh.  So is that where you met him? 

A: That's w h ere I met him, right. 
Q: Okay .  Okay .  Did you learn French? 
A: Pardon me? 

Q: Did you learn French? 
A: Oh, yes.  I went to French school.  You kn
ow, it's been a long, lo
ng time.  I still speak 
it but I'm a little rusty on it. 

Interview with Jacques Ribons  
76 
Q: Well, but it's such a huge change, 
where one month you were a prisoner in a

Q: And when did y
ou start doing that? 

Interview with Jacques Ribons  
96 
A: -- about you.  You know, we didn't know 
ab out you.  So all of
 a sudden  they had 
interest in me and my life and my past.  Be
fore that, you know, n
obody ever -- I never 
talked about it.  They know
 that -- where I came from. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: But we never talked  about an ything. 

Q: Were they already grown up wh
en  they  started asking questions? 
A: Yes. 
Q: Okay . 

A: They were already grown up. 
Q: Do you have grandchildren? 
A: In fact, yes, I do, quite a few of them. 

Q: Are the grandchildren interested? 

A: They are.  They are.  But, you see, 
I have -- my  wife wound up marrying somebody 
who's not Jewish.   

Q: I see.  O k ay. 

A: My kids, for the most 
part, they're not Jewish. 
Q: I see. 

A: So I don't have -- you know
, wh at I mean?  It's -- 
Q: That's right.  It
's not, it's not -- 
A: It's sort of -- 

Q: Yeah. 

A: -- a different situation here.  Who are you going to  talk to. 

Interview with Jacques Ribons  
97 
Q: When your brother was still 
alive, did you talk to him ab
out the past, because you both 
had been through it together, or
 did you not talk about it? 
A: Well, we talked very little about it because
 we both went thro ugh th e same thing so, 
you know, there was really 
not a lot to talk about. 
Q: You both knew it. 
A: You know, we just kept it in.  And my  br
other in particular, he
 wouldn't talk about 
anything, you see. 

Q: Yeah.   

A: I finally started talking and, you know, a
nd started telling and -- but he didn't.  He 
didn't  want to. 

Q: Tell me, when  you did start talk
ing and telling, did it change you? 
A: Change me? 

Q: I'm asking, did it? 
A: No. 
Q: Did it change your relationship with your kids? 

A: No, it didn't change.  They have symp athy
 or -- what is the other word.  I don't 
remember the word but 
they have, they were 
sympathetic to what I 
went thro ugh.  They  
wanted to know more abou
t it when they got older. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: And, well, when you go thro ugh, I guess, 
a marriage, I wound up broke after so many 
years -- 
Q: Yeah. 

Interview with Jacques Ribons  
98 
A: -- what do you do.  I c
ouldn't  take them where I wanted to take them. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: So Lisa suggested let's do this
 and this and this.  And I did. 
Q: So you went back  with Lisa? 
A: I went back with Lisa one time, Lisa andmy  son.  Then I went back another time to 

Poland.  It was my granddaughter -- no, gran
dson, rather, and my  son and Lisa and I. 
Q: And what kind of -- you know, di
d you go back  to your hometown? 
A: I went back to my hometo
wn.  I showed them where I liv
ed.  It's so often that the 
night was -- we got there late in the afternoon. 
 I couldn't show them the main town .  We 
showed them the area wh
ere the ghetto was wa
s still fenced up, sort
 of.  And I guess -- I 
don't think anybody's  living there now -- 

Q: Yeah. 

A: -- after so many years.  And so we we
nt thro ugh the killing camps.  The first one, 
which was Blechhammer, Gross-Rosen, and 
Buch enwald.  So th ere was not -- you go 
through this and you really do
n't see what really happened. 
Q: No, it's so many years later but nevertheless, 
it's the same -- it is ba
ck in the area, back 
in the places where it all happened. 

A: That's right. 

Q: And I can't imagine that it wouldn't have ma
de an impression on them, that it wouldn't  
have had great me aning for them. 
A: It did make an impression, mo stly Lisa. 

Q: I see. 

Interview with Jacques Ribons  
99 
A: My son, I don 't really know whethe
r it made that much of an impression. 
Q: Okay .  Well, what about 
you?  When  you went back , was it like it was in your 
memo ry?  What kind of impression 
did you have of 
your hometown? 
A: My hometown, if I coul
d have disappeared  wh en I was a baby, I would have. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: That's how I felt about my  hometown, so. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: But there was nothing th ere, you know. 

Q: Have you spoken at schools? 
A: Pardon me? 
Q: Have you spoken in cl
assrooms to young kids? 
A: No. 

Q: No.  Or to teenagers?  Or 
has it been mo stly wh en you talk
 now, it's been to your own 
family  me mb ers?  

A: To  my  own  family  memb ers.  You  kno w, th
ere's another situation, that some people 
that project themselves, that did well --  
Q: Yeah. 
A: -- I happen to know one or two, that di
d well financially and they  try to project 
themselves as the people that 
it happened to .  So they  want to write a book and they want 
to do this, they want to do th
at.  And everybody else is left
 behind.  So they  do that and 
they come in the fo
refront of all this. 
Q: Yeah.  That's right. 

Interv iew with J a cques Ribo ns

A: And they  went to schools right here in _________ --

see it, some of these people that go to th
e school and teaching
 of what happened -- 
Q: Yes. 
A: -- don't tell them the whole story. 
 They make up some of the stuff. 
Q: There's always a danger that that can 
be, you know.  Sometimes people remember 
things differently but -- 

A: You remember things differe
ntly but also this guy, this
 person is in the forefront. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: He wrote a book.  He's pushing himself. 
 Like he went to 
see the governor and 
_________. 

Q: I think I know wh at you're saying, is th
at you found that a little bit distasteful. 
A: Push ing themselv

Q: Yeah. 

A: And you're kind of le

little reserved, you know. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: And so people call him.  
You know, they know 
that, so.  I don't 
know.  I just -- 
Q: Have you ever, have yo
u ever given an interview to a newspaper before? 
A: Yes, I did.  In fact, there was a man here
 that was in the newspaper business -- not in 
the newspaper business.  He worked for the newspaper.   

Q: Okay . 

Interv iew with J a cques Ribo ns

A: They have a quarry, rather -- 
Q: Okay . 
A: -- that they were getting stones.  I don't know fo r what purpose.  Probably  for making 

cement or whatever.  And they 
buried artifacts.  And what I 
mean, artifacts, what I have 
seen is primarily jew elry, cases and cases and 
cases of jewelry that, military trucks that 
drove up and they loaded a
ll that stuff up and _________.
  And th ey had GIs with 
machine guns guarding all this. 

Q: And this would be at Buchen wald? 
A: At Bu chenwald.  And I told  him the story.
  And he was going to write.  And his bosses 
said you can't do that because you'd be ac
cusing th e government.  It disappeared .  
Nobody knows where it 's at.   It di sappeared
.  What that was ____
_____.  Nobody knows 
why.  And, you know, 
he says do you have a

Q: Yeah.   

Interv iew with J a cques Ribo ns  
1 02 
A: We had one in France, a couple brothers
 from my  hometown __
_______ with me.  
They  witnessed that.  They  told
 them.  There are a couple of other people that I met that 
were there at the same time I was, you kno
w.  And that didn't do it.  He says the 
government would be accused of what. 
Q: Well, it could be that it was so ld -- either 
they gave -- either they transported that 
jewelry and gave it up to  the government or 
the soldiers themselv
es just took it. 
A: I got to tell you, people went
 over there after they left a
nd they  found all kinds of stuff 
buried in the ground becau
se they stepped on it. 
Q: So you -- 
A: Whole cases opened. 
Q: So you're saying jewelry 
that was buried in the ground 
on the site of Buchenwald. 
A: On th e site of Buch

Q: Yeah, in the quarry. 
A: And knowing what I knew after the war -- 
Q: Yeah.

Q: Yeah. 

A: And then they shot them. 
Q: You're talking ab out the Germ

Interv iew with J a cques Ribo ns

A: Before the war ended.  During the war.   
Q: Yeah. 
A: We were still prisoners.  They du
g these tunnels and 
they killed them. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: So th ere would be no witnesses.  The 
guards who came forward and said, told the 
story was a German -- 
Q: Okay . 
A: -- that -- who saw what happened.  So th
ey  started digging and they fo und all this.  
And the little reporter, he didn't w ant to wr
ite it because you're 
accusing the government 
of hiding things or stealing th
ings.  He says you can't do that. 
Q: So this was the interview that
 you gave to a newspaper man. 
A: The newspaper man. 

Q: Yeah.  And it never went anywhere. 
A: Never went anywhere.  So -- 
Q: Well, I'm grateful that 
you have spoken with us toda
y, you know, that you have 
wanted to  get your story recorded  by th e Ho lo
caust Museum here in Washington, D.C.  
We're very, very appreciative that you've done it. 

A: You know, I tell you, my  mo ther was an angel. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: And my mother, when she said that, I ha
ve never forgotten what she said to me. 
Q: Yeah.  Those were amazing words, an
 amazing, and an amazing sacrifice. 
A: And she said to me, go save yourse

Interv iew with J a cques Ribo ns  
1 04 
Q: Yeah.  I'm glad that you shared that.  A
nd I'm glad that other people will be able to 
hear that and know that abou
t her when they 'l l be able 
to listen to your story. 
A: I'm very appreciative. 
Q: Is there anything else you would want to
 add to  wh at we'v e talked about today? 
A: I don't know what to think of.  Well -- 

Q: You know, in one interview, you can ne
ver catch -- you can never get everything. 
A: You can't.   

Q: It's just like that in life.
  It's how -- we'v e talked for 
a couple of hours now but, you 
know, we'r e talking about your whole life so 
how can you put all that in a few hours. 
A: Well, you know, _________ I 'm 
going to add a few th ings.  
Q: Okay . 

A: I don't know wh ether you can 
put it in perspective or not.  
But, you know, 
they used to 
take people and hang them to 
teach the people a lesson.  If yo
u do this, the same thing is 
going to happen.  
And people start ed maki
ng noises.  So they ha
d machine guns in the 
towers and they star
ted firing, you know. 
Q: You mean the dying people make noises. 
A: Not th e dying people.  The 
dying people were hanging.  
They  couldn't make noises.  
They  were just swinging. 
 But they just, 
they had guard s on th e towers -- 
Q: Okay . 

A: -- that the prisoners starte
d making noises, anything at a
ll, some movement, they fired 
right in the crowd, 
into the prisoners. 
Q: Wow.  Wow.  So you couldn 't
 even show that you were upset. 

Interv iew with J a cques Ribo ns  
1 05 
A: Oh, of course not.  You know, they 
took you out and they did what they call 
_________. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: And you had to watch it, you know, the ha
nging, you know.  You ju
st couldn't stay in 
the barracks.  You had to watch the whole epis
ode.  And this 15-year-old kid that worked  
with me and smoked cigarettes and they caught
 him doing it, even though I did also, he 
wouldn't tell them th
at and they  hung him. 

Q: Oh, my God. 

A: A French  kid. 
Q: Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  And there bu
t for the grace of God it could have been you 
because you smoked as well. 
A: Right.  And, you know, nearby there wa
s some English prisoners of war.  And we 
used to encounter them
 when we walked to  work .  Y
ou know, sometimes we walked the 
opposite direction. 

Q: Yeah? 

A: And, anyways, in that place -- 
Q: Yeah? 
A: -- we end up -- we used to hike.  We were
 in an open, open fiel
d in the open area and 
they bombed the hell ou
t of it.  And they came very fre
quently because of
 the fact that 
they produced 
oil, fuel --  

Q: Yeah. 

A: -- out of coal.  They extracted fuel. 

Interv iew with J a cques Ribo ns  
1 06 
Q: So it was -- 
A: _________ 
Q: It was a target.  It was, you know, trying
 to take up something that could help the 
German war effort -- 
A: Right. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: -- you know, so when they 
bombed the place, you had no pla
ce to go.  And we were in 
the open.  Fo r some reason or another, I walked
 in through one of th
e bunkers that they 
built, that we built for them. 

Q: Uh-huh. 
A: They had -- I went in ther
e and for whatever reason they didn't kick me out, this one 
part. 

Q: Okay . 
A: And they bombed the hell out of it.  You 
know, they -- it just ch
oked.  They  couldn't  
penetrate.  It didn't kill anybody except a pi
ece of ceme nt fell on some person there that 
killed them. 
Q: But it meant that you were a hair's br
eadth away from death so many times, so many 
times.  And it's incredible.  It
's incredible.  I mean, it gets me -- gives me the sense -- I 
mean, one of the questions that I have is di
d you ever not have f
ear?  For the entire six 
years, was there anytime you were not afraid? 
A: No.  I was afraid.  I was afraid for my life.
  I'd run into -- one time during an air raid, I 
went into a shack -- 

Interv iew with J a cques Ribo ns  
1 07 
Q: Yeah. 
A: -- you know, that had a shed on top of it.  
And basically people do that for shrapnels.  
The debris starts fallin g wh
en the bomb explodes.   
Q: Yeah. 

A: And they  buried all the -- the whole -- th
ere were about ten people there.  And we 
were all buried.  Fortunately enough, anot
her bomb dropped nearby and uncovered us 
and we found each other ri
ght on top of one other. 
Q: Oh, my  goodness.  Oh, my  goodness. 

A: Well -- 
Q: Well, any final thoughts? 
A: No.  I hope it never happen again. 

Q: Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, as I say, I know th
at it cost -- I k n ow that it's not easy to 
reme mb er these things but I also, on behalf
 of the mu seum, I'm very appreciative that 
you've taken the time and th at you have shared  
all of this with me today and through us to 
be able to share it with those who will resear
ch and those who will show interest in what 
happened  to  people, in the futu
re.  So with that, I'd like to
 say that this concludes -- 
A: Well, excuse me one second. 
Q: Anything else you want to ad d? 

A: I only want to add one thing. 
Q: Okay.  Let's do that before I -- 
A: I want to go back in time. 

Q: Okay . 

Interv iew with J a cques Ribo ns  
1 08 
A: _________ whole thing.  But 
this man that they shot that 
I told you, they took us out, 
an old man. 
Q: The father? 
A: The father. 

Q: The father of those _________. 

A: The father they shot. 
Q: Yes. 
A: They had me out there.  And fo r wh atev
er reason, you know -- we were against the 
wall.  For whatever reason, he just couldn 't d o  it.  And they told me that -- 
Q: Are you talking when you 
were in the ghetto, you mean? 
A: In the ghetto.  When 
the ghetto was closing. 
Q: When  the ghetto was closing.  So wa
s it a German soldier who was doing the 
shooting? 

A: It could have been a Pole also.   
Q: Okay . 

A: Or a German.  I don't know who th ey 
were, you know.  It wasn't the SS. 
Q: Okay .  And it was in a -- 

A: I think they were SA people.  Yo
u know what they are, right, I'm sure? 
Q: Excuse me.  SA? 
A: SA. 
Q: Yeah.  SA, yeah. 

A: Okay.  The SS people. 

Interv iew with J a cques Ribo ns  
1 09 
Q: There were SS and there were SA too, yeah. 
A: SA.  They are the on
es who did the shooting. 
Q: I see.  I see. 

A: So an yhow, I didn't have to go for burial
.  You know, I don't know wh at they did.  

There were about 19, 20 people there that
 were killed that day -- that night. 
Q: That's right, in th e middle of the night. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Thank you.  Th
ank you very mu ch. 
A: I know you probably 
had a burden on you, y
ou know. _________ people. 
Q: Well, it is -- I'll finish, I'

more.  But what I'm g o ing to say right now

Q:  Hello.  This is the United States Holo
caust Memorial Museum interview with Mr. 
Jacques Ribons on June 10, 2014, taking 
place between Washington, D.C. and Las 
Vegas, Nevada.  It is a con
tinuation and addition to the inte
rview we conducted with Mr. 
Ribons on May 20, 2014. There 
were some topics that were
 omitted from the original 
interview, and Mr. Ribons wo
uld now like to complete that
 picture. So please, Mr. 

Interv iew with J a cques Ribo ns  
1 10 
Ribons, let me know wh at it is that you wanted 
to add to what you orig
inally talked to us 
about.   
A:  I am not sure that I gave the interv
iew on the subject of a march from Blechhammer 
to Gross-Rosen.   
Q:   Let's talk about it in de
tail, even if it mig h t be in th
e original interview.  Tell me 
about that march and as much as you remembe
r.  And what about it is significant in your 
mind?  

A:   Well, the Russian Army came close,
 took over just about all of Poland.   
Q:   Yeah. 
A:   And you can hear th e rifle shots, and 
the Germans took out the 
whole tent, with the 
exception of some very sick people
 that were left there.  And 
we start walking.  We didn't  
know wh ere we were going or nothing.   
Q:   So which camp was this?   
A:   This was Blechhammer.   
Q:   Blechhammer.  Okay.   

A:  So from Blechhammer we walked.  And 
every second night or every night, if I 
remember right, they to
ok us to a farm.  And we slept 
outside in the barns, where they 
had the cows and th e pigs, and you know, 
the prisoners went there to sleep.   
Q:   And so what time of year was this?   
A:   What time of year?   
Q:   Yeah.  Was it winter?  

A:   January.   

Interv iew with J a cques Ribo ns  
1 11 
Q:   So it was cold?   
A:  Yes.  I think it was the month of January .   
Q:   Okay.  So was ther
e snow on th e ground?   
A:   Oh, yes.   
Q:   Was it difficult to walk?   

A:   It was difficult to walk.  Mainly, we 
walk on the main str
eets, where theGerman 
Army started retreating.  We walked along side the ravine, so 
to speak, you know, 
alongside that main street.  And there were
 guns, but the Russians 
machine gun the area 
where the Germans were walking.
  And occasionally, they hit us
 as we were walking.   
Q:   Can I interrupt just for a second?   

A:   Sure.   

Q:   When they machine gun, 
does that mean they were flyi
ng overhead and doing this?   
A:   The Russian Air Force was flying over
head and had machine guns, primarily, aimed 
at the Germans.  So they ha
d German guards with machine 
guns watching us.  So they  
kind of machine gunned along the line of the prisoners. 

Q:   I see.  So they must have been flyi
ng pretty low, and it was nevertheless dangerous 
because you were walking ri
ght next to them --   
A:   Right.   

Q:   -- on the side of the road?   
A:   Correct.  So occasionally, they  killed so
me prisoners.  I don't think they  could have 
helped it.  They were aiming at the guards
, primarily, and they 
carried guns, machine 
guns and rifles and so on to  watch the pris
oners.  And we walked.  Probably ev ery night 

Interv iew with J a cques Ribo ns  
1 12 
we stopped.  We slept outside in th e snow
.  And on a Su nday , we wound up in  a barn 
with the cows and pigs.   
Q:   How were you dressed?   
A:   In -- very skimpy, in the prisoners' uni
forms that we wore.  Myself, personally, I had 
a -- I happened to have a sweater somehow.  
I don't remember how I got it.  And I wore 
that sweater.  And I also wore
 bags, you know, the empty bags
 of cement as protection to 
keep warm.   

Q:   And you would wear that under the unifo rm?   

A:   Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.   
Q:   And wh at kind of footwear did you have?   
A:   Myself, I had a pair of boots someho
w I got, and there were no soles on them.   
Q:   Oh, my.   

A:   So you know, they were 
very skimpy.  It was actually 
-- you know, we got all wet.  
My feet got all wet.  And well, I didn't have 
any shoes.  So I wrap ped, you know, some of 
the stuff, my feet in cloth, that I could find 
or whatever I could get,
 you know, so my feet 
wouldn't freeze.   
Q:   So when you were walking along the si
de of the road , and it was January, and there 
was the ma chine gunning from the Soviets, a
nd the Germans as well, were there snow 

drifts?  Was it loud?  Was it icy?   
A:   No.  We actually walked
 not on the outside of the road
, because it was impossible to 
walk, but we walked
 on the main road
 to the side.   
Q:   I see.   

Interv iew with J a cques Ribo ns  
1 13 
A:   And you know, on one side of the street
.  And as we were wa
lking, the Russians, I 
don't know if willingly or not, the machine gu
n, primarily, they tried to machine gun the 
guard s.   
Q:   Yes.   

A:   And of course, the guard s moved in amo
ng th e prisoners.  So 
you know, I guess they 
mu st have hit some prisoners.   
Q:   I see.  So the guards 
would realize this, and then th
ey  would intermingle with the 
prisoners?   
A:   With the prisoners, correct.   
Q:   I see.  And by that poi
nt, were there a lot of German
 guards, or was it few and far 
between?   
A:   No, it was a lot of guards.  Again, th
ey carried machine guns.
  However, you know, 
the roads were full of people go
ing west, because the Russians 
were right behind us.  So 
we could hear rifle shots from time to time.  
So they were very, very
 close behind us.   
Q:   So you were about 
to talk about one 
Su nday you ended 
up so meplace.   
A:   One Sunday, we ended up in a barn.  I 
don't know where that was.
  And th ey gave us 
coffee.  And they were shooting, practicing, I 
guess, either that or shooting at the legs of 
the prisoners.  So of course, they fe
ll, and us, we left them there.   
Q:   Who was doing the shooting?   
A:   The Germans.   
Q:   The Germans were shooting at
 the legs of the prisoners?   
A:   Right.

Q:   As you were drinking coffee?   
A:   Well, we were getting coffee from that bi
g -- what do you call it -- pot, and they were 
giving th e prisoners coffee.  Well, the prisone

allowed that to happ
en, the coffee pot.   
Q:   Yeah.   

A:   And as we got th e coffee, they were
 shooting at the legs of the prisoners.   
Q:   Oh, my.   
A:   So when that happened, of course
, they fell.  They couldn't stand up.   
Q:   Of course.   
A:   And we had to leave them behind.  And 
I am sure -- I personally didn't see it, but I'm 
sure they killed them after they left.   
Q:   Yeah.  Yeah.  Did people 
die as they were marching?   
A:   Oh, yes, many, many people.  They were ac
tually froze to death.  We had to sleep in 
the snow.  Occasionally, on a 
Sunday -- we walked
 about three Sundays, and I was able, 
with my  brother and some other kids, get in
to  a barn with the cows and the pigs, you 
know, and keep warm, you know.   
Q:   So you were walking fo r at least three Sundays?   
A:   I believe it was three Sundays.   

Q:   So that would mean at 
least two weeks, maybe more?   
A:   Three weeks.   

Q:   Three weeks?   

A:   About two to th ree weeks.  And ag ain,
 I don't know how many pr

that march.   
Q:   Yeah.   
A:   I mean, it mu st have been an  enormous 
amount of prisoners that 
passed on.  I try to -- 
I'm sorry.   
Q:   No, I was going to  say, it's  the kind 
of stamina you would need
 in order to survive 
that would be very high, and some 
people just couldn't hold out.   
A:   That's correct.  We fo
ught for our lives, literally.   
Q:   Yeah.   

A:   And I was fortunate.  I was able to make
 it.  I tried to help a man that I knew in 
prison.  He was from France.  
And his name was Ribak.   
Q:   Ribak?   

A:   R-I-B-A-C or B-A-K.  I don't know how he spelled it.   

Q:   R-I-C -- 
A:   No, no.  R -- Ribak.   
Q:   Oh, R-I-B-A-C-K?   

A:   R-I-B, yes.  And I helped him as much 
as I could, and then I finally gave up.  I 
couldn't do it any longer, and --   

Q:   In what way were you trying to
 help him; by helping him walk?   
A:   By helping him walk.  Yes, by helping 
him walk.  I mean, I knew him in prison.  We 
occasionally worked side by
 side, you know, so.   
Q:   Did anybody try to escape?   

A:   Probably.  I didn't have the stam
ina.  I wouldn't  know where to go.

Q:   Yeah.   
A:   You know.   
Q:   Yeah.   
A:   We were in Germany at the time, so.  

Q:   Were there civilians on the ro

A:   Oh, yes, there were civilians.  Ther
e were people with push carts and their 
belongings.  There were all kinds of people 
that walked, because they were trying to 
avoid the Ru ssians, you know, particularly
 if they were Ge
rmans, you know.   
Q:   It sounds like chaos.   
A:   Yes, it was, absolutely.  And we had 
Russian prisoners, and you know, all kinds of 
prisoners walked alongside of us
.  The ro ad wasn't big enough
 for all of these people that 
walked, including the German Army.   
Q:   Tell me this, how many lanes did it have, or at least the main roads you were on?  
Were they single lanes, one in each  direc
tion, or were they wider than that?   
A:   I believe they were wi
der than that.  I'm not sure, 
you know.  Again, we were 
fighting for our lives.  We didn't pay atten
tion too mu ch of wh at 
was going on around us, 
except, you know, we tried to
 hide from the bullets.   
Q:   Yeah.   
A:   You know, and we didn't know they we

they came down real 
low.

absolutely chaos.

on th at stretch from Blechhammer to Gross-Ro sen in a van.   
Q:   Oh, my gosh.   

A:   Just recently about a year ago.   

Q:   So that would be like in 2013?   
A:   Yes.  Yes.   
Q:   So you redid the whole death march walk?   

A:   The whole trip, yes, the whole trip.  
From my  hometown wh ere I was born to the trip, 
all the way to Gross-Rosen and fro

Bu ch en wald .   
Q:   So tell me, the 250 miles, does that 
go from your hometown to Buch enwald, or does 
that go just from Blechhammer?   

A:   From Blechhammer to Gross-Rosen was about
 a 250-mile stretch.  At least, I didn't 
know.  My daughter to
ld me that it was that distance.   
Q:   Of course.  I mean, at 
that time, how would you know.  
It took you three weeks or so 

at that time.  How lo ng did it take by van when  you went?   
A:   By van, I don't know, about eight hours, te
n hours.  I'm not sure.  I didn't even think 
of paying attention to

Q:   Yeah. 
A:   I drove with my  daughter, my grandson and my  son.   
Q:   Did any of it look familiar to you,
 the road, when you 
went on it again?   
A:   No, no, no.  It was totally changed, be
cause they -- first of all, you know, with so

mu ch chaos, you didn't even pay attention 
to anything, except, you know, you try to 
survive.  You know, the food wa
s very scarce.  I was in one of the areas where you ate in 
one of the farms that we walked in.  I saw a 
house, people, that the 
farmer, I guess, lived 
in.  And I run to  the farmer, knocked on th eir 
door asking fo r food, for bread.  And the 
commander, so to speak, the pers
on in charge of the prisoners, he said, Wh at are you 
doing here, in German.  And I said
, I would like to have someth
ing to eat.  So that young 
woman -- it was a young woman.  He said, he 
says, you can give him bread, provided  that 
you sleep with me tonight.   

Q:   Oh.   
A:   So she says okay.  And she gave me a lo
af of bread.  And wh en I went out, I got hit 
over my  back with a cane.  And 
I went to my brother, and I ga
ve him half of the bread.  
We ate that just one night, you know.   
Q:   Oh, my gosh.  What a horrible -- wh
at a horrible situati

absolutely cruel.   

A:   It's much crueler than 
anybody can 
even anticipate.   
Q:   Yeah, yeah.  What human 
beings will do in order to k
ill the humanity in others.   
A:   Well, I would imagine, you know
, it happens all over, even today.   
Q:   Yeah.   

A:   So the cruelest animal 
on earth is the human being.   
Q:   Unfortunately.  Unfortunately.   

A:   So anyhow, then we got 
to Gross-Rosen.  We were there for several days.  We were 
packed like sardines.  And we
 had just a bowl of soup dur
ing th e day.  And I don't 

Interv iew with J a cques Ribo ns  
1 19 
reme mb er whether we got bread or not.  We
 were there for almost
 about a week.  And 
that was Gross-Rosen.  And 
Gross-Rosen was very secluded
, because they had -- they 
were mining marble in that area.  So the 
people on the outside couldn't see what was 
going on there in that -- in Gross-Rosen.  
And you know, after five days or so, a week 
maybe, maybe longer, they loaded
 up -- they loaded us up on
 the freight trains.  They 
were going and taking th e marble to market, I 
guess.  And they load
ed up the prisoners 
on th ese open freight trains, and they took us
.  We didn't  know wh ere we were going, and 
with guards on them.  Each car had two guar
ds with machine guns or regular guns.  I'm 
not sure what.  At that time, I wasn't
 really familiar with the weapons.   
Q:   Yeah.  Just th
at they can kill.   
A:   Right.  So they -- when 
they loaded us up, we were on 
the way.  And we got all the 
way to Weimar where we were bombed.  I th
ink the allied's air force made a mistake and 
didn't  know who it was, because they did 
see guards watching these things, you know, 
and they bombed the train.  
A lot of Germans, the guard s, including the prisoners, were 
killed, a lot of them.   
Q:   Yeah.  And this 
was allied bomb ing?   
A:   This was allied bomb ing.  I don'
t know what air force that was there.   
Q:   Yeah.   

A:   But primarily, I th ink the U.S. Air Force was in that area, or the U.S. Army was in 
that area, you know, so.   
Q:   Did you ever make 
it then to Buchenwald Œ  

A:   Yes. 

Interv iew with J a cques Ribo ns  
1 20 
Q:   -- or just to Weimar? 
A:   No, we made it into 
Bu ch en wald .  T h ey  to ok  u s
 to Buchenwald, and I --  
Q:   Excuse me.  Can I interrupt you for a minute.   

A:   Sure. 

Q:   Did the train go until Weimar, the Town 
of Weimar, or did it go up to the camp at 
B u ch enw a ld ? 
A:   To my knowledge, th
e railroad into Buchenwald, 
the railroad tracks, to my 
knowledge, if I remember right, were bombe
d out.  So  they took us by truck.   
Q:   I see.  I see.   

A:   Into Buchenwald.  It was not all that far. 
Q:   No, no.  It isn 't that far.   

A:   So in fact, we used to walk it af
ter the war.  Because Bu
chenwald is in the 
mountains, and this is below the mountain.  So
 from there, we were there, I don't know, 
from January until April.   

Q:   So you were in Buchen
wald for all that time?   
A:   Oh, yes, and we were in what is calle
d a children's barracks.  It h ad three -- I think 
they had three or four barracks wh ere they ke
pt just children.  And I guess, there was a 

whole story behind it, because the -- also Ge
rmans, since the 1930s, were -- they were 
prisoners.   
Q:   Yes.  In Buchenwald, it had had 
a lot of German political priso n ers.   
A:   Right.  So they sort of
 protected, to my knowledge, th
e kids.  And at the time that 
they tried to take the kids out, we went to th
is appellplatz, and you know, we all lined up.  

Interv iew with J a cques Ribo ns  
1 21 
And then  they took us back to
 th e barracks.  What happened in th e interim, I don't know.  
I guess they had -- they had, within the prison
, you know, people that carried guns.  In 
fact, outside of Buch en wald , there was an ammunition factory.   
Q:   Now, I'm a little confused at this point.  When you were in Buchenwald from 

January to April, --    

A:   Right.   
Q:   -- who was in control?   
A:   Well, the Germans were in control. 
 However, there also, since the factory where 
most of the German prisoners worked, and th
e other prisoners, I don't know wh ich one of 
the prisoners they kept work 
in the ammunition factory, they
 smuggled in a lot of arms, 
the Germans.   

Q:   Okay.   

A:   And to my  knowledge, they  had Germans with guns roaming the prison.  So  I guess, 
the Germans feared a lot that the prisone
rs, whether it was the Germans or Russian 
prisoners, I don't know, but I know there were Germans.   
Q:   Okay .  But when  you are saying Germ
ans, are you talking ab out German political 
prisoners or --   
A:   German political prisoners
 that smuggled in arms.   
Q:   Oh, I see what you are saying.  They 
were working in the am
munitions factory.   
A:   In the ammunitions factory.  

Q:   They were smuggling in 
some arms th at were kept se
cret from the authorities?   
A:   Absolutely, yes.   

Interv iew with J a cques Ribo ns  
1 22 
Q:   And yet, they would patrol the pl
ace with those arms; is that correct?   
A:   Not patrol, but they  watched.  As so
on as the Germans left
, they took over.   
Q:   I see.  As soon as the regular Nazi, yo
u know, they left, thenthese political prisoners 
--    
A:   Yes, these political prisoners came out 
and tried to help -- they were not just 
Germans.  They were all kinds
 of prisoners.  There were Sw
edes, and th ey had Danes.  I 
don't know where -- the Danes I can understa
nd, but I don't understand th e Swed es, how 
they got there.   

Q:   Yeah, because they are 
supposed to be neutral.   
A:   Right.  I don't know how th ey got there, 
but they  had them there.  So and the reason I 
know that to be a fact is because I was hosp
italized.  I had extreme 
diarrhea that they -- I 
begged th em to take me away already.  I couldn't  take it anymore.   

Q:   I remember that part in our conversation before, yes.   
A:   Right.  So --    
Q:   And what was -- what did you do and 
your brother when you were there?  Were you 

also put to work or --    
A:   No.   
Q:   -- or not?   

A:   No.  In Buchenwa
ld, we didn't work.   
Q:   I see.   

A:   At least the time, the peri
od of time that I was there.   
Q:   I see.  Okay.

A:   You know, there were deaths all over.  Pe
ople cut out the innards of the dead and ate, 
you know.  This is the kind of stuff that I 
saw.  It was a matter of either dying or doing 
that, so.   
Q:   What about, when you 
say that the Nazi authorities left and the political prisoners 
took over, could you say that 
they liberated -- the German 
political prisoners liberated the 
camp, or was it another army  that did it?   
A:   No, no.  I think it was -- I can 't think of
 the general's name that came in.  Let me kind 
of put a little emphasis on the whole situ
ation, the whole picture there.   
Q:   Yeah, yeah. 

A:   They had a -- if I can rememb er the town -- Erfurt.   
Q:   Erfurt, yes, is near there.   

A:   It was in the mo untains, across the m
ountains.  You could see from Buch enwald all 
the way into the mountains of E
rfurt.  They had a battle going on
 in Erfurt.  At night, we 
used to see the cannons going 
off, the artiller y  going off at 
night from Erfurt, because it 
lit up.  So the general who was the tank comma
nder, and I can't remember his name.  My 
memory is not like it used to be.   
Q:   That's easy to find out though.  We 
can look it up, you know
, who th at would have 
been.   
A:   Well, he got killed in Germany in a ca
r crash or something.  I'm not sure how he 
died, the general.   

Q:   Oh. 

A:   He was in charge of the tank 
unit that came into
 Buchenwald.

Q:   And did you see then
 American soldiers?   
A:   Yes.  There was just a tank came in with
 a couple -- they
 op en ed  th e tu
rret, and they 
peaked out.  And the Germans were already 
gone.  They jumped 
off the guard towers, 
and the prisoners were chasing them.  You kno
w, so they caught some.  You know, it was 
all chaos, you know. 
Q:   Yeah. 
A:   They killed some, you kn
ow, and they brought 
some back to prison.
  So they -- the 
Germans were gone.   
Q:   Yeah.   
A:   The army came in  and -- the American
 Army  came in, and of course, they  start 
giving us food, you know, ratio
ns and stuff like that.  And th en organizations came in 
from western Europe that fed us after a while.  So but as a whole, E
rfurt, they were there 
for about a week or maybe 
more.  They were shooting 
at the Germans across the 
mountains, and you could see it.  
At night, you could see it.   
Q:   So when they finally came into the -- into Buchenwa
ld itself, th e tank and with the 

solders, --    
A:   The tank, yeah, with 
the people in it, opened the turret and looked out.   
Q:   And did they get out?   
A:   You know, I don't recall that.   
Q:   Okay.

Interv iew with J a cques Ribo ns  
1 25 
A:   We kind of roamed around, because 
there was nobody th ere to keep us anywhere, 
you know, because the Germans were alrea

used to sleep on the top bunk.  It was three high.   
Q:   Yeah.   

A:   And the top bunk, I could lo ok out the 
window.  You know, what it is was glass, and 
when I got the window in a certain  positio
n, we could see the main road.   
Q:   Really?   

A:   Right.  So they  -- because we were on to p of a mountain.   

Q:   That's right.  It was high up.   
A:   Right.  So we looked in there, a
nd I saw the tanks, the Germans running and 
Germans jumping off the towers
.  And it was just like a movi
e scene of some sort.  So 
this is what I saw through that window.  
And I was kind of -- you know, because they 
were shooting into the barracks.
  So we got to the ground on 
th e floor, and we just waited 
it out, you know.   

Q:   Were there any revenge killings?   

A:   Yes.  They had, some of the people, 
I don't know what rank they were, what capacity 
they were, the Germans, they
 took them in to where th
ey held the prisoners, the 
Buch enwald prisoners, you kno
w, that they tortured them
 there.  And they took the 
Germans, and th ey gave us 
two hours for people to go

it is Eisenhower.  I'm not exactly sure.  Bu

happened  at Buchen wald, he is so appalled th
at he orders the town speople of Weimar to 
come and be forced 
to look at --    

A:   Right.   
Q:   -- what was going on in  the camp.   

A:   Correct.   
Q.   Were you still there when th at happened ?   
A:   Yeah.  That was in the beginning, yo
u know, because we were there several weeks 
after.   

Q:   Okay .  Can you tell me about that?   
A:   About that, I cannot tell you very mu ch .  
But you know, because first of all, the army  
kept away  the prisoner
s from these people that
 they brought in.   
Q:   Oh, so you saw them at a distance?   

A:   We saw them in the distance.  We couldn
't get so close to them, because of the fact 
that, you know, revenge would have taken place.
  And in the U.S., don't take revenge on 
other people, you know, even, yo
u know, they come into a to
wn, and they don't kill other 
people.   
Q:   Yeah. 

A:   Either they 
keep them prisoners or whatever.   

Interv iew with J a cques Ribo ns  
1 27 
Q:   So in other words, the reason wh
y the prisoners were kept away  from the 
townspeople was because to
 prevent any kind of 
violence happening?   
A:   Well, you couldn't help some violence.   
Q:   Right.   

A:   Because the prison -- the wires were 
all torn down.  You co
uld go out through the 
wires anywhere you wanted to go.
  I used to go to the villa
ges and ask for things to eat, 
you know, in the beginning.   

Q:   And did they give them to you?   

A:   Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  I think they had so
 much fear in them, th
at it was beyond belief.  
You know, a guy nearby Bu chen wald was a mayor
 of this particular town.  He was made 

mayor right after the Germans mo ved away a
nd the Allieds came in, the Allied Forces.  I 

don't know who installed him as
 mayor, but he was the mayor. 
 I walked into  the mayor's 
house, and I asked him, I would like to have 
a bike.  He says, no problem.  He gave me 
an address, and I went up th ere and tried to 
get the bike.  And of course, the bikes were 
all hidden.  You couldn't find them.  So you 
know, the idea is that th e -- the reason I'm 
saying that, that the Germans had so much fear
 of being beaten up 
or being killed.  And 
in fact, some of them were.   

Q:   Yeah.   

A:   By the Russian prisone
rs, you know, th e ones that we
re older, not the youngsters, 
you know.   

Q:   Finish the story about the bi
ke.  Did you finally get a bike?

 it.  It w as all empty.

1 28 
Q:   Okay.   
A:   All the barns were empty.  Everything wa
s empty.  You know, so I didn't get a bike.   
Q:   So but it means th at by th
e time that the Americans got -- 
they were entrenched there, 
you were ab le to move out of th e camp?   

A:   Oh, absolutely.  Somehow or another, we
 got right through the fence.  The fence was 
torn apart, and we just
 walked out.  And we went to the ne
arby towns.  I went a couple of 
times to Weimar.   

Q:   What was it like?  Did you s
till wear your prisoner's uniform?   
A:   We didn't have anything else, 
really.  Just a prisoner's uniform.   
Q:   How did people behave?   

A:   Fear.   

Q:   Okay.   

A:   Some of them were beaten up by othe
rs, by the prisoners.  So
, you know, I was a kid 
incapable of doing an ything, too weak.   

Q:   Yeah.   

A:   So.   
Q:   But you saw it in their eyes?   
A:   Oh, yes.  I saw it, saw 
them being beaten up, and they  were beaten up wh en they 
brought the Germans in.  I don't know whethe
r it was so ldiers or civilians that were 
brought in, and kept them where 
they used to torture the prisone
rs.  They kept them there.  
And they used to let them in at, let's say, 3:

hell out of them, you know.  Bu t you know.

ren't former guard s that you could recognize?   
A:   No.  No.   

Q:   Okay.  The reason they 
were brought in is because th
ey happened to be German, not 
because they happened to
 have been a particularly cruel guard?   
A:   They had some too.   

Q:   Oh, yeah.  I'm sure.   
A:   But they  watched how mu ch beating 
th ey could get, you know.  They  wouldn't 
allow, even though that person had seen
 about 19 Germans being shot, you know, 
soldiers.   

Q:   Yeah. 
A:   And I couldn't tell you who shot them
.  I know they wore 
military uniforms, but 
whether there were civilians in the uniforms 
or American or any other nationality that 
shot him, you know, so.   

Q:   And how old were you at this point?   
A:   I was born in 1927.  This was '45.   

Q:   You were 18 years old wh
en you were seeing this?   
A:   Yes.  You know, we were us
ed to seeing all kinds of stuff.   

Q:   Yeah.   

A:   I have seen dogs chasing the prisoners
 and eat them up alive, you know, kill them

and eat them.  You know, it was not somethi
ng -- or people being hung, for whatever 
reason that they found, you know.  
So it was not something that --    
Q:   It's not new to you, in other words?   
A:   -- I hadn't seen before.  It wasn't new.   

Q:   It wasn't new to you?   

A:   No.   
Q:   It was already --   
A:   I, myself, were under a gun once or tw
ice, you know, but I -- they let me go.   
Q:   You mean you were unde
r threat of being shot?   
A:   Right.   

Q:   And this was where?   

A:   This was still in the ghetto.   

Q:   I see.  Oh, I remembe
r.  I remember.  Yeah, you had 
told me about that.  How long 
did you stay at Buch enwald  af
ter the Americans arrived?   
A:   It wasn't really that long.  There was 
a -- you know, I didn't kno
w, because I didn't -- 
there was a rabbi, I suppose.  He was an Am
erican chaplain that
 worked on taking the 
kids out of Buch enwald.  And I guess, each
 government, to my knowledge, I found out 
later, let in so many kids.  And some kids, I 
understand, went to Cuba.  Some kids went 
to England.  Some went to Switzerland, and th
ey went to France, they
 went to Belgium.  
It depended on the government 
how many kids they would allo
w in, into the country.   
Q:   I see.  And so you 
were amongst that group?   
A:   I was amongst that group th at went to France.   

Interv iew with J a cques Ribo ns  
1 31 
Q:   And how long did yo
u stay there?  Where did they  take you?   
A:   They took us, if I -- if
 my memory is right, to a home
 that the Roth
schild family 
owned.   
Q:   That the Rothschild family owned?   

A:   And they gave the home, I guess, to 
use for the kids for the summer.  I don't know.  
They  had their hires in France to take care of
 all the kids.  To wh at capacity, I have no 
idea.  They gave us a home.  
They gave us food.  They  gave
 us schooling, you know.   
Q:   Yes.   

A:   They sent us to school, you know.  So
 it was a variety of things, and I don't know 
who was what.   

Q:   Okay.   

A:   You know, like for instance, my  friend, E
lie Wiesel, look wh at happened  to  him.  He 
went to the Sorbonn
e in Paris.   
Q:   Yes.   

A:   You know, the guy that
 was also his friend, my ho
metown friend, a fellow by the 
name of Gallenstein (ph.), he went also to 
the Sorbonne, because th
ey were geniuses.  
They  were geniuses, these guys. 
 And I don't know wh
o else.  And they sent them to trade 
schools, and they sent them to different th
ings. I came to the Unite
d States early  enough, 
you know, right past -- it wasn't 
that long after that, about a year, year and a half maybe.   
Q:   Do you remember the date
 that you came to the U.S.? 
A:   The date exactly --    

Q:   Or the month?   

Interv iew with J a cques Ribo ns  
1 32 
A:   Yes, I do, but I have it written down.   
Q:   It's okay.  I'm just curious.   
A:   Yes, I do have it.  I have it written down
.  I used to know, but I don't know now.   
Q:   Yeah.  Did you sail into New York ?   
A:   At the moment, 
I cannot remember.   
Q:   That's okay.  Did you sail into
 New York  or some other port?   
A:   No, we came -- we went to -- from Fran
ce, they took us to Sw
eden.  We came from 
Sweden across the SS Gripsholm, 
which used to be a cruise sh
ip in War World II.  It was 
reconverted into a passenger ship
.  And they brought us into
 New York.  There was a lot 
of other people.  There were a lot of Russian
 immigrants and all ki
nds of stuff, all kinds 
of people that were on that ship.  And we 
came to New York .  Wh
en I came here, they 
didn't  have Ellis Island anymore.   
Q:   Okay .  How did you -- where did you land?   
A:   Well, I had an uncle in New Jersey. 
 My uncle, supposedly, was going to  come and 
pick me up.   
Q:   Oh, I remember this from th
e interview itself.  And he couldn
't on th at particular day.   
A:   That's right.   

Q:   And you --    

A:   So the hirers, I believe, came to pick
 us up and kept us there for a few days.   
Q:   Okay .  So in order -- here's another qu
estion.  Is there anything else from your first 
interview, because I do reme
mber we talked about coming 
to your uncle in New Jersey 
and then  your life after that. 
Is there anything else you thi
nk you didn't cover in your 

Interv iew with J a cques Ribo ns  
1 33 
European experiences that you wa
nt to add, or do you think we
 pretty much touched it?   
A:   Yes.  We covered this.  
When we were in the ghetto.   
Q:   Okay.   
A:   And they took all the Jewish people out.   

Q:   And we 'r e talking about your hometown ghetto?   

A:   My hometown ghetto, when
 they took out all the Jewish
 people, the transportation to 
take us to the next town , big to wn, was by horse and buggy.   

Q:   Really?   

A:   Right.   
Q:   Not by truck, not by train, nothing like that?   
A:   Nothing.   

Q:   By horse and buggy?   

A:   They  wouldn't spend money for gas to ta
ke the Jews across a c o uple of towns down.   
Q:   Okay.   

A:   So how long we traveled
 on that, you know, with  the 
horse and buggy, I don't know.  
I can 't really remember.   
Q:   Yeah.  But you remember going that way?   
A:   Oh, yes, absolu tely.  Abso lutely.   

Q:   Okay.   
A:   My mother and my  sister and my  cous
in, you know, my  grandmother, we were all on 
that horse and buggy thing.   
Q:   Yeah.  Well, any other thoughts you'd lik
e to add now?  You know, we can always 

Interv iew with J a cques Ribo ns  
1 34 
do this again, by the way.  If there is some
thing th at comes up that you have fo rgotten, 
we can always make an appointment to talk
 again for a brief momen t and then record 
that.   
A:   The march was very important because a 
lot of people died.  I don't know how many.  
Hundreds and hundreds
 of people died.  
Q:   Yeah. 
A:   From Weimar going to Gross-Rosen. 
Q:   Yeah. 

A:   Because they'd  sh oot them.  They 'd  shoot
 them in the legs.  And when  they did th at, 
they couldn't walk.  And when 
we left, they shot them.   

Q:   It's just --    

A:   Or left them dead to di
e, either one of th e two.   
Q:   Yeah. 
A:   And I've seen many kids my  age, thei
r legs were frozen.  The flesh was peeling off 
their legs.   
Q:   Oh, dear.  Yeah.   
A:   So I mean, it's --  
Q:   Were there girls on the road too?  I m
ean, was this usually young
 men, or were there 
women on the road as well?   
A:   They  had wo men.  There were no girl
s.  They  had wo men that they kept for 
prostitution there in Blechhammer.   
Q:   I see.   

Interv iew with J a cques Ribo ns  
1 35 
A:   So these were the women that th
ey kept, that many came with us.   
Q:   I see.   
A:   And then they parted comp
any.  Where, I don't know.   
Q:   Yeah.  Well, I'm v ery grateful that you 
have gone in to mo re detail.  It's  not called a 
death march for nothing.  It sounds horrific and 
amazing that you were ab
le to survive it.   
A:   Incidentally, another thing I need -- I don't need, but I'll tell you.   

Q:   Okay. 
A:   I came to Paris.   

Q:   Yes.   
A:   And I was roaming the streets, you know. 
 We were kids and curious or whatever.  I 
ran into a young girl that looked very familia
r.  Because the guy th at I dragged to  help 
walk --    

Q:   That's right, Mr. Ribak.   
A:   Mr. Ribak.   
Q:   Yes. 

A:   Showed me pictures from his family.  
And he said his wife and his kids -- I don't 
know if he had one ch ild or not -- 
showed me pictures of them --   
Q:   Yes.   

A:   -- being in Paris.   
Q:   Yes.   
A:   And I came to Paris.  And now, you know
, we were roaming the streets, an d I see a 
girl, a young girl that looks familia
r.  Well, I walked over to her.   

Interv iew with J a cques Ribo ns  
1 36 
Q:   Yeah.   
A:   Believe it or not, it turned 
out to be this guy's daughter.   
Q:   No.   

A:   I swear on my life.  

Q:   So how did that happen? 
 Did she say, My name --   
A:   I apparently remembered from the pictur
e what she looked like.   I suppose this is 
what happened.  And I asked her the last name. 
 She told me the name is Ribak.  And the 
first thing I said, is your dad alive.  She says, yes.   

Q:   So he made it?   
A:   He made it.  She took me over to their house.   
Q:   Oh, my goodness.   

A:   I saw this guy Ribak, and it was really something.   

Q:   Oh, my goodness.   
A:   And if I could remember that from a pictur
e, it's really something.  I don't know.  Sh e 
looked just like him.   
Q:   It is.  I mean, there are many amazi
ng mo ments and miracles here.  One, that you 
recognized her from a picture.  
Two, that he made it.  Three,
 that she was able to bring 
you to him and that yo
u were able to find out what happ
ened to him, and it's an amazing 
story.   
Do you rememb er, after you left him, di
d he tell you how he came to make it?  
A:   No, I really didn
't talk about it.   
Q:   I see.  I see.   

Interv iew with J a cques Ribo ns  
1 37 
A.   I didn't talk about it.  I saw him, and I 
was so happy to see him, and I met his family.  
I don't remember if I met his wife, but I did me
et his daughter.  I saw her on the street.  
She was going somewh ere, you know.   
Q:   Now, did you ev er see him or 
have contact with him after that?   
A:   No.  No, I didn't .   

Q:   Okay.   
A:   I think I was busy w
ith myself, you know.   
Q:   Your own life, yeah.   
A:   My own life and trying to put my
 life and my  brother's life together.   
Q:   Yeah.  That was a big enough task.   

A:   So anyhow, I told yo
u about the story, I was drafted into the army here.   
Q:   Yeah.   

A:   So on and so fo rth.  No
w I cannot recall.  There was something else I wanted to tell 
you.  And I, for the life of 
me, I'm trying to remember.   
Q:   You know, if you have forgotten now 
and you do rememb er it, write it down and get 
in touch with me again, and we'll talk about it.   
A:   Hold on just a second
.  I wrote something down.   
Q:   Okay.   
A:   Let me see what I -- le
t's see.  The march from Gross-
Rosen -- to Gross-Rosen, the 
freight train, which you are aware of.  People froze or got shot or wh atever.   

Q:   Yeah.   

A:   And let's see.  I just to
ld you about the frozen limbs.   

Interv iew with J a cques Ribo ns  
1 38 
Q:   That's right.   
A:   The legs and whatnot.   
Q:   Yes.   
A:   Unfo rtunately, these kids were my  age, you know.   

Q:   Yeah.   

A:   That's all, really that I had written down.   
Q:   Okay.   
A:   Oh, yes.  When I was in that hospital.   

Q:   Yes.   
A:   My brother --    
Q:   And this hospital is in France?   

A:   No, this hospital 
is in Buchenwald.   
Q:   Oh, the one wh ere you got 
sent for diarrhea, that one?   
A:   Yes, right.  And we used to get two slic
es of bread a day in rations wh en  I was in the 
barracks before I got sick.  And my brother 
saved -- collected my  rations and saved as 
much as a whole loaf of bread, 
a loaf wasn't that big, but it 
was a loaf of bread that he 
saved for me when I got back.  An
d he put his life in jeopardy.   

Q:   Oh, my. 

A:   And you know, of course I shared the 
bread with him later.  
But when I got back, 
when we were still in prison, he ha
d saved a whole loaf of bread.   
Q:   Amazing. 

A:   In fact, when  he passed away, I talked a
bout that to th e people that were there, so.   

Interv iew with J a cques Ribo ns  
1 39 
Q:   Yeah.  It is a very -- it's a mo ment that
 is -- shows truly what he was made of.  Like 
the mo ment when your mo ther tells you why 
she can't leave shows you the stuff she was 
made of.   
A:   Right.   

Q:   Yeah.  Thank you for adding th
at detail.  Thank you very mu ch .   
A:   Thank you very mu ch fo

Q:   Mr. Ribons, it is my honor.  And 
I appreciate -- I appreciate this.   
A:   Well, I do have tears in my eyes.   

Q:   Oh, I know.  It's n o t easy.   
A:   Thank you.  I never had the nerve to 
do that, to be quite honest with you.   
Q:   Well, I don't know what it 's like to have gone thro u
gh what you have, but I do know 
there is a cost to bringing all of these things up.  And I appreciate it.   
A:   I did tell you ab out my  Army  life, didn't I?   
Q:   I think you did.   
A:   Yeah, I think I did.   

Q:   Yeah.  If -- yes, you did.  Now that I reca

being in Korea and some of the experiences yo
