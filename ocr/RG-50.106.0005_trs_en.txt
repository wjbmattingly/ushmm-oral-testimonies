iginally it was into the Infant

 the Infantry outfit 
into another one wh
ere they needed a 
musician for a string quartet. 
 
Q: Where was this located at this point? 
 
A: This was in South Carolina,
 Columbie  Columbia, South Ca
ro linA:  And then we went 
overseas quite quickly, just before the invasion. 
 
Q: When  did you  where did you go when  you  
 
A: We went to England. 
 
Q: And when did y
ou arrive there? 
 
A: Just before the invasion of Europe, and th
en we went immediately over into France. 
 
Q: Okay .  And can you describe wh
at happened from that point on? 
 
A: Well, in the few days after the invasion, 
we arrived at Normandy, and then  we went 
right thro ugh those battles, you know.  I have 
five battles that we took  took part in. 
 
Q: And what specific unit were you in? 
 
A: Well, I was with  at that time I was with 
Headquarters Company, so I did  at first, I 
was in the Dynamiting Company, and then I wa
s transferred out of that, and I was just 
attached to Headquarters Compan
y of the 59th Signal Battalion. 
 
Q: And what was your role then? 
 
A: My ro le was as  Headquarte
rs Company was, first o f all, 
I  I to ok care of records, one 
of the jobs, and I also was like 
a messenger with different trips. 
 
Q: And you said you were in five battles? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Do  yo u  reme mb er t h e n ames? 
 
A: Well, it was all th
e European battles. 
 

Q: Uhhuh.  
 
A: We just followed General Pa
tton from the start of after he took over, and went through 
Europe. 
 
Q: Uhhuh.  
 
A: Until we got to Germany. 
 
Q: Okay.  And then you arrived in Germany? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: What was your first  what's your first recollection, your first me mo ry? 
 
A: Of Germany?  
 
Q: Uhhuh.  
 
A: Hah. 
 
Q: I mean, here you were a Jewish soldier 
coming to Germany.  Do you rememb er what 
your feelings were at that time? 
 
A: You know, everything  we 
didn't know too mu ch about what was happening.  And that 
was one of the things that was so shocking
 when we arrived in 
Buch enwald.  But we 
weren't told in those days really what was happening.  
 
Now, we had heard rumors of what was happ
ening; that they were killing Jews and so 
forth.  Even before I went in
to  the Army , we had gotten rumo
rs of that, things like that 
happening, but nobody was really sure, youknow.  There was no  everything was kept 
quiet. So  wh en we got into Germany, of co
urse, it was a matter of just getting through 
and fighting and going through these battles. 
 There was no time to think of things like 
that until we  until we got to
 the camp of Buchenwald. 
 
Q: What was first i mpression?  What 's the fi r st thing you saw 
 
A: In Buchenwald?  
 
Q:  when you got there? 
 
A: Well, I guess we were one of the first 
units into Buchenwald.  And I remember 
standing just inside the entrance, and havi
ng the feeling of not 
only horror, but utter 
desolation. What I saw was on my left, was a 
mass of dead bodies piled about eight feet 
high, and stretching out maybe 
30 or 40 yard s.  The bodies 
had been soaked kerosene, 
ready to be burnt, but I guess we arrived too 
soon for them to do it.
 On my right, there 
were several people that were lying there, 
and some of them were crawling.  Some 
weighed 80 pounds.  So me looked half dead
 to me.  One of them was crawling towards 

me, and I said something in Yiddish.  I can 't  remember for sure, but "Vus Kenneth Tuin 
Zick Sehelthen, (ph)" and one of them came 
up and tried to kiss my  feet. The feeling of 
helplessness and not believing was very prevalen
t.  The gentile soldiers who were with 
me were almost in tears and 
shaking their heads.  And I re
member o n e of the survivors 
coming up and telling me that the Polish SS  ha
d run out the back of the camp , and th ey 
were getting away.  And th en later, one of th
e  our soldiers, who had gone back  there, 
said that two of them had been caught by so me
 of the inmates and killed. The scene that I 

described to you has never left my memory.  
And wh en I hear some  of these groups that 
are now prevalent in the United States, aroun
d the world, that say that this never 
happened, this really prevaile
d on me to tell what I saw, b
ecause I will never forget it.  
 
We left this area soon after.  I guess we had 
another assignment.  And it was a long time 
ago, 50 years or so.  I don't reme mb er what
 that assignment was between you and me.  
But that scene that I saw at 
the entrance will never be forgo
tten, and I felt that I had to 
describe it. 
 
Q: Do you know what 
day you arrived there? 
 
A: I wouldn't know the date, but I know th at 
Patton was 20 or 30 miles ahead of us.  He 
had co me through, and then gone on.  He
 was always ahead of the other units.  
 
And so that was really probab
ly the exact date that Buchen
wald was liberated.  Because 
the fact that the SS troops that 
were still there, and they had 
tried to, you know, get rid of 
that evidence, so it was not more 
than one or two days difference. 
 
Q: And you said you had no prep arati
on for wh at you woul
d be seeing here? 
 
A: No preparation. 
 
Q: You were a young man.  
 
A: No preparation. 
 
Q: You were in your early 20s 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q:  with no preparation? 
 
A: No preparation of this at all.  
 
And not  it was a situation that we really di
dn't believe.  Not only me, but everybody that 
walked in  with me, you 
know, at that time. 
 
Q: Were you with other Jewish soldiers? 
 

A: No.  There were Jewish so
ldiers in our outfit, but I th
ink I was the only one at that 
point that had walked into this. 
 
Q: How big a group were you? 
 
A: Oh, th ere mu st have been 10 or 12 of us. 
 
Q: And you walked
 into the camp? 
 
A: We went into that camp.  
 
Q: Are there any other experiences that you 
had besides talking in Yiddish  to the one 
survivor? 
 
A: No, because after we did su rvey this area, 
we were told we have to get out; that other 
people were coming in to do so mething to  
 
Q: Would  
 
A:  work with the survivors, and 
 
Q: How long were you actually inside Buch enwald? 
 
A: Maybe not more than a half hour. 
 
Q: So what was the purpose 
of you going?  What did th
ey tell you the purpose was for 
you? 
 
A: They just wanted to... 
 
Q: Witness it? 
 
A: Witness, as witnesses, right, to see what 
was going on.  And th en we  our whole outfit 
moved out after that, a
nd then that was it. 
 
Q: And you had described one
 young man's reaction.  A
ny other reactions that you 
remember from the other soldiers? 
 
A: Just disbelief.  I think nob
ody ever would have thought of
 seeing things like that.  
 
Now, I remember our outfit had 
gone through five battles, so
 we had seen many things.  
But this was  the horror of it and the immensit
y of it, you know, was 
hard to understand. 
 
Q: How much of the camp  did 
you see?  Did you walk around? 
 
A: Not  maybe we went in 40 or 50 
yards, and then returned, went back. 
 
Q: And do you feel that because
 you were Jewish, that your
 reaction was different than 
your fellow soldiers? 
 

A: I don't think so.  I think that they were also
 in shock; that they didn't believe this could 
happen.  Man's inhumanity to man. 
 
Q: Did you see any of the liv
ing quarters, the barracks? 
 
A: We saw barracks.  We didn't 
g o  into them, but they were  
 
Q: Can you describe what yo
u saw; what you rememb er? 
 
A: They were like wood
en barracks, but they were run do
wn if I remember co rrectly, and 
it was small areas where they were living.  I did see that. 
 
Q: Uhhuh.  
 
A: Tiny, tiny areas where they had lived, little
  probably  not even
 beds, you know, but 
probably on the floor. 
 
Q: So you ju st walked
 around on your own? 
 
A: Yeah.  We walked in on ou
r own, and then  we were told let's go, we're moving out, 
and that was it. 
 
Q: Did you talk about what you
 saw with the other men that you were with, the ten other 
men ?  
 
A: No.  We went into another assignment, and 
we had  we were spread out, so I didn't get 
to talk to too many people.  Later, we talk
ed about it, you know, 
and really, what I'm 
telling you, we talked am
ong ourselves, you know. 
 
Q: Did you discuss any of th
is with any of the officers
 in the camp, in the Army? 
 
A: One of the officers, if I re
member, was with us when we we
nt in, but we didn't discuss 
that afterwards, because things were still popping, as you know, because that wasn't the 
end of the war. 
 
Q: And you said you spok
e Yiddish to one of the 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q:  survivors?  
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And did you speak to 
any of the other survivors, or just that one? 
 
A: No.  It seemed to me  if I remember
 correctly, that was the one.  The others 
were  couldn't speak.  They 
were mostly  I was thinking 
afterwards, I wonder if they 
really survived, 
because they looked in such bad 
shape that probab
ly many of them 
didn't . 
 

Q: So you then left, and can you just 
briefly tell us what happened after? 
 
A: Well, we would  we had 
to go on.  And after that, it
's hard to remember what 
happened.  I remember carryi
ng one message to a Russian general in Lavesig that, and 
forgetting to shake his hand, and he was 
left h anging there as I left th e room.
 
And finally, after a few months
, the war was  did finish. 
 
Q: And then  you  
 
A: But I did write about this. 
 
Q: Well, let's  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: So then you  how much lo
nger were you in the service? 
 
A: Probably not more th
an a few more months. 
 
Q: And  
 
A: Before I left. 
 
Q: And then you came back? 
 
A: Came back to  
 
Q: Michigan? 
 
A: To Michigan. 
 
Q: And what did you do th en? 
 
A: Okay.  Then I went to  I decided that I 
would go and really take mu sic mo re seriously, 
and I went to college, and be
came a music teacher and a music performer.  M et my wife, 
Betty, who is also a musician, and that's what we'v e been doing since. 
 
Q: Uhhuh.  
 
A: To this day. 
 
Q: Well, let's talk a little bit about how 
this experience that you went through in 
Buchenwald as a young man, a young soldier 
affected you.  Does it still affect you? 
 
A: Hmm.  I would imagine it does
, 'cause the immensity of what
 I saw, and the fact that I 
was there, of course.  And I had been te
lling not only my family, but other people, 
whoever I saw, or whoever was interested of 
these things that I had that it was hard to 
talk about. But when I first 
came b ack, people wanted to 
know.  I remember writing to 
my family even from Eu
rope of what I saw. 
 

Q: Describing  
 
A: Describing what I saw.  And I did that. 
 
Q: Do you still have those letters? 
 
A: No, no.  What happened was my  mo ther used
 to read those letters, and finally  and cry 
whenever she read them
.  So finally, I decided that  get rid of them.  And now I realize 
that was a mistake.  I shouldn't have
.  But I did.  I got rid of them. 
 
Q: Did you take any photographs
 of wh at you saw wh en you  
 
A: Yes.  We had some photographs. 
 
Q: That you yourself  
 
A: But those photographs were included in  some
 of the letters, and so I got rid of those, 
too. 
 
Q: Uhhuh.  But you yourself had a camera? 
 
A: No.  We had  I had a camera, but I didn't  ta
ke all those.  There were other soldiers that 
did take photographs, and they  
gave me some of the prin ts th
at they got.  That's where I 
got them. 
 
Q: You had said you had written or  was that
 the letter y ou're talking about, the letters 
that you wrote home? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: You didn't write anything fo rmal? 
 
A: Well, no, I didn't write anything formal. 
 
Q: Formally? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: How did that experience that you went 
thro ugh affect your feelings about being 
Jewish? 
 
A: Well  
 
Q: Did it change the way you feel? 
 
A: No, I don't think it changed.  Our family
 has  you know, is a family that had many 
Jewish clergy in it.  My mother
's family, on her side, there we
re Rabbis that went back  as 
far as four generations.  I think we came 
from Spain, and th en 
to Poland, and so I 

reme mb er stories about, you know, great, grea
t, great grandfather being Rabbis and so 
on.  
 
So I've always felt Jewish.  I don't think it ha
d any affect on it.  But it sure opened my  
eyes about what had been going on, and why,
 and why this happened was a big question; 
why it was allowed to happen. 
 Because I think now as we 
read books and go back into  
history that many people knew 
what was going on, and nothi
ng  not enough was done to 
save these people. 
 
Q: Did th e Army  have any mechan ism for the 
soldiers to talk out their experiences of 
what they  saw 
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  at places like Buchenwald? 
 
A: No, not  not that I know o
f.  Perhaps, you know, other units that moved in  to try to 
work  with th ese people may have had th at, but we were not given that, you know, 

responsib ility; or nobody ev er talked to us about it after that. 
 
Q: Were mo st of the other men that you 
came to the camp  
with young like you? 
 
A: Yes, just about my age, maybe a little bit older. 
 
Q: And you said that you did talk ab
out it with them a little bit after? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Do you reme mb er any of the exchanges 
th at you've had; an
y of their comments? 
 
A: Same thing that I  that I talked  told you.
  First of all, there was disbelief.  A nd nobody 
ever said that they would have
 imagined the immensity of this
 terrible horror that we saw. 
And to think that these people  and in ever
y contact that we had with German people, 
they always said that it wasn 't us that did 
these horrible things.  We were not Nazis.  But 
it turns  
 
Q: When  you say contact, when was this contact? 
 
A: Well, if we talked to a German person. 
 
Q: Over  you're talki
ng about when you were  
 
A: Yeah, as we went from, you know 
 
Q: Towns? 
 
A: Citytocity, townto
to wn , and we naturally would sa
y did you know ab out wh at was 
happening.  Your town was right next to this
; the ovens there.  They all said, oh, no, we 

didn't  know.  We were not
 Nazis. But 
it turned out 
[many|am]
 times, they were.  We 
found evidence of Nazi materi
als in their attics and so 
on.  Everybody denied  it. 
 
Q: What kind of  wh at did you do after you 
left Buchenwald?  Yo u said you went to 
different towns and cities.  What was your role? 
 
A: Okay.  Since I was a Jewish soldier, I 
knew a little Y iddish, I sort of became the 
billeting person.  In other word
s, I would go around ta
lking to people to allow soldiers to 
stay in different places.  And that's what 
I mean when I had contact with the regular 
persons in th ese town s. 
 
Q: And what was their reception to you knowing 
 
A: Oh, fine. 
 
Q:  that you were Jewish? 
 
A: No, it didn't matter.  They we
re just glad to see American
s, you know.  Oh, we're glad 
to see you. 
 
Q: And they  knew you were Jewish? 
 
A: Sure, because I talked Jewish .  I'm sure German people  
 
Q: Right, right.  
 
A: The German people could tell th
e difference between German and  
 
Q: You were speaking Yiddish and  
 
A: I was speaking Yiddish, and they were 
answering in German, right.  And usually I 
would go to the Bü rger
meister, because he was the one that
 went, tell us, tell us where we 
could find a bille
ting, you know. 
 
Q: Well, is there anything else that you 
wanted to add; that you wanted to say 
 
A: Well 
 
Q:  about your experiences? 
 
A:  it was heartrending, as you can hear, and I 
just  I hope that I  what I've said, you 
know, can verify what, you know, what has 
 what happened over there.  And as an 
eyewitness, I thought that I sh
ould have some evidence, you 
know, to that effect, and tell 
that this did happen, and it wasn
't a hoax.  And it was horrible. 
 
Q: Well, thank you very mu ch 
fo r telling us your story.  
 
A: Okay.  I'm happy I'm able to do that.  It wa
sn 't easy, but I felt  we felt it was important. 
 

Q: As you said, this is somethi
ng that has stayed with you.  
 
A: Right.  Especially the scene 
in the entrance of the camp.  
 
Q: Were there any special signs that you saw? 
 
A: There was a sign above the camp , but you kno
w, I can't remember what it said now.  
Some of the movies I've seen, there had been
 different slogans, Arbeit?  You know about 
that.  Means  what was it. 
 
Q: Arbeitsdorf? 
 
A: Yeah, right.  But I don't really  remember if 
it said that in Buchenwa
ld .  It might have.  
It might have. 
 
Q: And that was the only camp  that you went to? 
 
A: That was the only camp we went to.  We were near  I had heard that we were passing 
by different ones, or there were, you know, as
 we went through, because we had just 
followed the line of the tanks, but 
we didn't   we didn't g o  to 
another camp.  That was it.  
So I don't know wh at happened in  Dachau, fo r 
example, or others.  Just what I saw in 
Buchenwald. One thing I do re
me mb er is th at  u
pon entrance into Bu
chenwald, not only 
was it the visual horror, but we had that terri
ble odor of dead bodies
 and kerosene, and it 
was  it was an odor th at made us all naus
eous.  A terrible feeli
ng of nauseousness and 
utter desolation.  And th is happened, 
again, at the entrance of this camp. 
 
Q: And the other sold ie
rs felt the way you do? 
 
A: Yes.  The other soldiers felt the way I did.  And as a matter of fact, now that I think 

back, I rememb er one of the othe
r soldiers not being able to st
ay there.  He had to leave 
immediately.  But I did not do that, because
 I wanted to see as much as I could. 
 
Q: Why? 
 
A: Because I'm Jewish, and I didn't want 
to, you know, forget what I was seein g .  I 
thought maybe some day in the future, I'll be 
able to describe this, or I would have to 
describe it, which I am now doi
ng. Another experience th at I had later in our area, area of 
Southfield, Michigan at the time,
 is we met a survivor of that
 camp.  He happened to be a 
jeweler who came to our house to show a sm
all, little charm bracelet that we were 
trying  th inking of getting fo r our twoyear old 
daughter at the time. 
 Now, this was over 
30 years ago.  
 
But wh en  he had heard that I 
went into the camp and was a 
liberator, he said you know, I 
was a survivor of Bu chenwald, too.  And th
e only way I survived  
was I finally cut off 
some toes in order to get to a hospital.  A
nd he was very emotional.  We hugged , and he 
cried.  And he said you, you saved us. An
d this happened, the meeting happened 30, over 

30 years ago.  And we see eac
h other once in a while, and memo ries come back, of 
course.  
 
Q: And this was  
 
A: On both sides.
 
Q: And this was an emotional experience for you? 
 
A: Well, as you can tell, it was very emotional,
 because he started to
