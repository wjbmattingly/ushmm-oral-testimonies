Question: This is a 
United States 
Holocaust Memorial Mu
seum interview with 
Ira 
Segalewitz
, conducted by
 Ina Navazelskis
 on Novemb er 7
th
, 2008, in 
Alexa ndria , 
Virginia .
 Mr. 
Segalewitz,
 thank you very  mu ch for ag reeing to  speak with  us. 
Answer: Oh , it™s my  pleasure, you know, I wa
nt to convey as mu
ch information as 
possible, so you know, future generations 
would at least k n ow about what happened 
to the Œ the people like me. 
Q: Well, we™re grateful for that. Can y
ou Œ can we start the story, like they™v e 

always does, at the beginning? Can you te
ll us a little bit about your history, where 
you were born, what Œ in what family
, in what town an
d so on. And when. 
A: Okay, okay. I was born in 
Sarn y, Pola nd
 in the year 1936. 
My mother™s family 
was Œ was known as the 
Ba gg
(ph) family, and they were 
quite a large family in Œ in
 
Sarny. 
And actually, they came from 
a town nearby, which was
 Dambro wicz
(ph)
. 
And my mother was one of 11 children, 
and so it was quite a large family. And 
when  I was born, my  mo ther, you know, l-liv
ed with her fami ly close by. And when  
I was about three and a half years old, you
 know, the war started, you know, and the 
German occupation of 
Poland
 began. And at Œ as mo st 
of us Œ mo st people know, 
there was an agreement in the 
Ribb entrop-Molotov Act
, which kind of divided up 
Pola nd , 
you know, be-before the 
war even started. And so, soon as the Nazis 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0557

occupied 
Poland
, the Russians moved their borders 
as well, and consequently we 
came under Russian occupation. 
Q: Can you tell me a little Œ 
let™s back up a little bit, befo
re we get to that part. 
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: Did you have any br
others and sisters? 

A: No, I don™t, I™m an only child. 
Q: You™re an only child. 
A: I™m an only child, mm-hm. 

Q: And, can you tell us a lit
tle bit about your father, a
nd who he was 
and how that 
fit into the picture? 

A: Well, I Œ you know, I Œ I really don™t 
know mu ch about my  father, you know, in 
Œ the last time I saw my father was in Œ well, I was gonna Œ 

Q: Get to that part, okay. 
A: Œ tell you wh at Œ get to that, but I Œ 
Q: What kind of family
 did he come from?  
A: Œ yeah , he Œ he Œ he came from a town nearby, from 
Pinsk
, and he was a barber. 
And don™t know much about his family at 
all, you know. My mo ther and I kind of 
never talked  about that. And consequently 
I just don™t know. I Œ you know, I Œ and 
I™ve tried very hard, you kn
ow, to try and find out mo re
 about his family and I™ve 
been unsuccessful at this point. 

Q: Do you have me
mories of him?

A: I Œ I Œ you know, I don™t know if it™s 
an original memory, or Œ or you know, 
pictures and stuff, but I seem to remember Œ 
or Œ or stories that my mother told, but 
I seem to remember very we
ll, when Œ wh en  the war started that he Œ he was putting 
us on a train, that we were leaving 
Sa rny
 for the Russian Œ yo
u know, that Œ the Œ 
deeper into
 Russia
, I seem to rememb er him waving goodbye. And th at image of 
him is the only image that I 
have, you know. The rest I 
Œ I just don™t reme mb er. But 
that™s the only image that I seem to be in
grained in my  mind, and I™m not quite sure 
if that™s a true memo ry, or something my  
mo th er said to me, you know, at one point 
when  I was Œ was young or wh at, you know. 
Q: How old were you when  that 
Œ when  you were on th at train? 
A: I was about f Œ I was five and a half Œ 
I was Œ yeah, it Œ about five and a half at 
that point, yeah, five and a half, maybe six. 
Q: So, a very small child. 
A: Very small child, right. And that is 
my only memory. I mean, I™ve Œ I Œ I have 
some pictures of my  mother and Œ and my  
father togeth er. And I have a picture that 
we found here in the 
United States 
of him, you know, that my  mo ther had sent to 
his sister s here in Œ in the 
United States. 
But I, you know, don™t have any 
independent me mo ries other than  that. 
Q: Can you tell Œ the Œ then let™s go back a 
little bit. I mean, one of the reasons I ask 
this question is particularly when people 
were children, really
 small children during 
the war, we™re talking about fragmented memories.

A: Right. 
Q: Can you tell me your earliest memo ries, 
regardless of wh at they would be? Can 
you recall that? What are the earliest ep
isodes, or things you remember from Œ 
A: That Œ that being Œ being pushed into 
the cattle train a-and my father, you know 
Œ an-and that image of my fa
ther, that Œ that™s the only me
mory that I seem to have 
of then, you know. I have no 
prior memories. I can™t remem Œ  
Q: Of being in 
Poland
, of growing up in
 Sarny
, or Œ or anythi Œ 
A: Yeah, well, I Œ I didn™t Œ you know, I wa s only three Œ three and a half when the 

war started. And Œ and then, of course, 
fin Œ you know, the o
ccupation, we were 
living in Œ in Œ under the Russian occupa
tion for almost two 
years until the Œ the 
Nazis began the war on Œ on 
Russia
, you know, so Œ  
Q: Did your mo ther ever tell you about wh at
 that was like? What her life before any 
Œ all of this was like, and 
th en during those two years? 
A: I™m afraid not. You know, we never Œ ne
ver really discussed that period at all, 

you know. As a matter of fa
ct, we talked very little about the war or the Holo caust. 
My mo ther was Œ you know, every once in
 awhile she™d say something, but very 
seldom that Œ that discussion.
 Th Œ really, I began to rea
lize that what I™d missed, is 
after my  mother passed away, you know, that
 I didn™t have a history, I didn™t have 
the information of my fathe
r, and I didn™t have Œ know at all Œ don™t know at all 
what my father™s family Œ 
anything about my father. Don™t know wh ether he was an 

only child, or he had brothers and si
ster s, and just have no knowledge.

Q: Do you Œ did you ever ha
ve any contact with the 11 
siblings that your mo ther 
had Œ or the 10 siblings that she had, if she was the 11
th
?  
A: Yeah, she Œ my mother, two 
of her sister s came  to t h e 
United States 
before the 
war started. So my  mo th er always knew 
she had two sisters, you know, during the 
Holo caust, you know, she knew she 
had two sisters here in the 
United States. 
She 
just didn™t know where th
ey were. But there was Œ y
ou know, but they were the 
ones that we got to know. Bu t I Œ no, we 
Œ I never had th at discussion with them, 
unfortunately, you know. 
Q: So when your Œ when your fath er push
ed your mo ther and yourself in the train Œ 
A: Mm-hm. 

Q: Œ and that was when the 
Sov iet Union
 was already attacked by Nazi 
Germany
? 
A: Exactly, yeah. 

Q: That was your Œ the last time you had 
any contact with your 
mother™s relatives, 
is that so? 

A: That™s the Œ that™s right. 
With my mother™s rela Œ no 
Œ well, yeah, the last ones Œ 
Q: Aside from the two sisters Œ 
A: Sure. 
Q: Œ the ones who were in 
the town, is that correct? 
A: That™s correct, mm-hm, that™s correct. 
Q: And how come none of them went east? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0557

A: Don™t know. Don™t know th e reason, you 
know, but there Œ they
 all perished in Œ 
in Œ in Œ you know, they were a
ll taken when the Nazis came into 
Sarny, 
they set 
up a ghetto, and they  ro unded up 
all the Jews in the area, 
and of course then they 
slaughtered them all, they mu rd ered them 
all. So, you know. Th
e only survivor of 
my  mo ther™s family that Œ I have a pict
ure that I, you know, quite often carry with 
me, I happen to have it here. And Œ and th
-the only surv ivor is, besides the two 
sisters, you know, from this fami
ly Œ this is a 1914 picture Œ 
Q: Oh my. 
A: Œ and, you know, is Œ is my mother, and th Œ she™s that little baby over here Œ I 
mean, she™s a little child over here, a

 you know, who Œ 
Q: Her name is 
Marthe

A: 
Œ Ma rthe

Q: And her name was? 

A: My mother™s ma Œ name was 
Roch el

Q: 
Roch el
(ph). 
A: Yeah, mm-hm. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: Yeah. So she Œ she is th
e only survivor that we know
 of, and I did meet her and

Israel 
and we did Œ we did get meet Œ get to meet her

A: Well, yeah, I mean, everyb
ody kind of knew with th e fi Œ what happened to  the 
rest of the family. We all knew that they wo
und up in the Œ in Œ in th at ghetto, and Œ 
and never left, you know. 
Q: Oh, so the ghetto was liquidated Œ 

A: Oh, it™s like Œ 

Q: Œ it wasn™t like they were Œ it wasn™t
 like they were transported to a camp 
outside or something. 
A: No, they were Œ they were murdered
, you know, right there, you know, the 
machine gun Œ you know, th
e machine guns were set up from Œ from the Œ there™s a 
Œ a couple of years ago it was a 
book written about the escape from 
Sarny
, from the 
Sarny 
ghetto, and according to  th
at book, you know, it said they set up machine 
guns around them, you know, and mu rdered
 14,000 people that were there, you 
know, so Œ so Œ 
Q: D-D-Do you Œ did th ey surv ive the 1
941, or was this ghetto liquidated pretty 
early on? 

A: It was 40 Œ 40 Œ th-the Na
zis came in into the Œ into
 Sarny
, it was ™42, I think, 
and Œ and, you know 
Œ and they  liquidated it after a
bout six months. It wasn™t Œ it 
wasn™t very long. I™m not su
re about the dates, though. 
Q: I reme mber you said Œ you said Œ 
A: Yeah, yeah.

Q: So, in  a Œ in Œ in  many ways your fath
er wa-was very prescient, if he was the 
person who convinced your mo ther to
 Œ to Œ to go on the train. 
A: Well Œ 
Q: Tha-That was the right thing to do. 

A: Well Œ well, what ha Œ really happened 
is that my father 
was drafted into the 
Russian army. 
Q: Okay . 
A: And because he was in the army, he wa s able to get us on the train, you know, 

because Œ 
Q: Otherwise they would Œ 
A: Œ you know, otherwi Œ no way, yeah
, you know. That™s Œ that™s how we 
survived, you know, is th
at Œ the fact that he was able 
to get us on this cattle train, 
and that™s only because Œ 
Q: He was in Œ yeah . 
A: Œ of his Œ the army  connection, yeah. 

Q: Let™s go with your father a little more Œ 
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: Œ but we™ll return to your moth

A: No, th e only info rmation we have is 
this Œ you know, and th is is anecdotal 
information, that so
me body saw him on the Russian 
front. On Œ on Œ on Œ not Œ on 
no Œ 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ on the 
Stalingrad 
front, I™m sorry.

A: Right, that somebody saw him there. 

Q: So wi Œ that big battle. 

A: The battle to Œ you know, the battle of 
Stalingrad

information that we ever got, you know. 

Q: And so, were there letters that were 
every exchanged betwee

A: Not at all, no, no, no letters at all,

correspondence between the two of them.

Q: No. 
A: No. Well, you know, a couple of tim
es I Œ I tried to get information on
 Sa rny ,
 
and it was just nobody Œ you 
know, a couple of letters that I™ve written Œ as a matter 
of fact, a gentleman that I know that went to 
Sarny
, he couldn™t get any info rmation 
because you know, just there were no r
ecord s left, you know, that Œ that were 
available, so he couldn™t get any 
information, you know, so Œ yeah .  
Q: That™s Œ that™s more than frustrating.

Q: That™s more than frustrating. As you were going east, what was Œ wh at happened  

then? Wh ere did you and your

A: Well, we were on this cattle train, 
and it kept getting bombe
d, and I rememb er

would stop every once in aw
hile, we™d jump  out and y

be flying over, strafing the train, and that

13
 
 
Q: Were you afraid, or were you too little to be afraid? 
A: You know, I Œ I Œ I Œ I™m not sure. You

jump ed out of the cattle car and we were
 running, and my  mo ther and I were 

running, you know, and I rememb er, you kn

ahead of her, you know. And she finally
 caught up with me, 
you know, and Œ and 
she Œ she was so upset with, 
you know, that Œ that Œ that
 I let go of her hand, you 
know, she got Œ a-as a matter of fact, one
 time Œ we had that discussion one time, 
my  mo ther and I, and she kept sa
ying, I kept hollering, you know 
[speaks Yiddish 
here]
 She kept saying it in Yiddish, you kno
w. Why did you let 
go, why did you let 
go? She was so upset with me. 
[indeciphera ble]
 Bu t yeah, that was Œ that Œ you 
know, until we got to 
Ryev ka
(ph), well, we Œ we he Œ we 
were on this cattle train, 
and Œ and finally wh en we got close to Œ on the 
Vo lga  
river, ma Œ we got off, and 
my mother found a jo

Ural 
mountains. But befo re that, we were on a 
train, we Œ we came up and you know, we 
Œ close to the 
Vo lga  
river is where we got off, and we
 went up on some farm close 
to the 
Vo lga
 river. 
Q: Do you reme mb er that? Do you 
have any im-images from the farm? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0557

A: I-I remember Œ I remember
 my mother, yeah, my mo
ther working, you know, 
she Œ she milked the cows, 
she helped out Œ you know, 
and Œ and that™s about the 
only 
smegelings
(ph) of memory a Œ that Œ that I have.  
Q: What was Œ I mean , what Œ was your f 
Œ was her family a farm family back in 
Poland
? 
A: No, no. 
Q: So this was all new stuff for her. 
A: Well, yeah, you know, I mean, I don™t 
know how she knew that, you know, but Œ 
or how she learned it, but I Œ it was Œ yeah. 
Q: Survival. 
A: Survival is right. 

Q: Survival. 

A: But Œ but yeah, then when Œ when
 the Œ th-the ac Œ Nazis began the 
Stalingrad
 
campaign, that™s when we left from that 
area, because we were pretty close to 
Stalingrad,
 you know, an-and we 
wound up Œ well, dem
obilization was Œ had 
started, Russian were mobilizing, moving
 everything up, away from Œ as far as 
possible and setting up factories. And so th
ey  were getting Œ tryi
ng to get as many 
people into the 
Ural 
mo untain areas, you know, to Œ to
 work  on Œ in  war factories. 
Q: Effort, yeah. 
A: You know, you know. And 
that™s how we wound up in
 Ry ev ka
(ph), you know, 
which is by 
Ufa

Ufa

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0557

Q: What memo ries do you have of that time? 
A: Of Œ of Œ of 
Ry ev ka
(ph)? I have Œ you know, I have quite a few memo ries of Œ 
of 
Ry ev ka
(ph), you know, I Œ I Œ that™s a Œ I 
remember v ery distinctly that the 
barracks, you know, and stuff, that we we
re put in, you know, and the Œ the tiny 
room what we shared with 
this other family, the Œ the 
Go rky
(ph) family. So, the Œ 
the five of us were in this one tiny room
, you know, and which is Œ was comp letely 
bare. And we had th e straw mattress Œ 

Q: Total strangers? 

A: Total strangers, we never, you 
know, never met them before.  
Q: Were they from 
Poland
 as well? 
A: No, they were Russians.
 Why they wound up, who we
re they we Œ I don™t know 
how they  wo und up, or why they  Œ but th
ey  were Russians, you know. I mean, there 
was the 
Gorky
(ph) family, you know, and Œ and 
the Œ they Œ you know, I think 
there was the mother, a daughter which 
was about 12, I guess, and Œ and a boy 
about my age, you know
, the three of them. So the five of us were in this one tiny 
room, you know, and Œ 
Q: And what language did you
 speak with one another? 
A: Well, at that time, y ou know, 
since the Russians had occupied 
Poland
 fo r Œ 
Q: Couple years, yeah. 
A: Œ ye Œ you know, that Œ two years before
 too, and also the two years during, you 
know, we had picked  up quite a bit of 
Russian. My mo ther, you know, could speak 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0557 
16
 
 
Russian and Po lish or Yiddish,
 and Œ well, there was the Œ as far as I know there 
were no Jews in Œ in Œ in that area, yo
u know, I mean the Œ 
you know, so Yiddish 
never came up until somebody fo
und out that I was Jew ish, you know, and then 
they started teasing me
 and stuff, you know.  
Q: We™ll get to that Œ to that point. Wh
en Œ wh en you spoke al
one with your mother 
though, was Yiddish your Œ the language
 that you spoke with one another in? 
A: Oh yeah, yeah, th
at Œ that was our Œ 
Q: Not Polish. 

A: Not Polish, no.  
Q: Not Polish. 
A: Yeah, Yiddish was the language Œ my  
first language was Yi
ddish, you know. A 
little bit of Polish was spoken
 in the house, I understa
nd, you know, because I Œ I 
knew some Polish, you know, but I didn't Œ 
Q: It wasn™t the language of conversation at home. 
A: Exactly, you know, it was Yiddish. An
d you know, of course later on was all 

Russian, you know, so Œ 
Q: And you picked up ru Œ yo
u know, a five year and a half year old will pick up a 
language fairly quick ly. 
A: Righ t, mm-h m.

Œ the work camp in re Œ in
 Ry ev ka
(ph) was Œ 
everybody had to wo rk, you 
know, they brought 
in all the people and of Œ all the 
kids attended school. So I was Œ I was 
attending the school, you know, while my

Q: So your first class is act
ually your beginning school Œ 
A: It was Russian, yeah.

A: No, th e Œ 
Q: Œ a little kid in school in 
Russia
? 
A: No, th e only thing th at I Œ really stands
 out, you know, i-is Œ is I Œ the distinct 
time then when I first Œ the kids found out
 I was yid Œ Jewish, you know? And th ey 
started teasing me and Œ 
and beating me up, and Œ 
Q: In a mean Œ in a mean way? 
A: Oh yeah, you know, they Œ as far as 
we knew, we were the only Jews in there 
because my father had, you kno
w, was able to get us on th
e Œ on this train. But there 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0557

may have been other ones, you know, the

ngers and hands frozen. Sh e™d come in Œ she™d come 
from work an-and she™d sit do

for, you know, a period of 
time where we™d cover her up with the Œ w

and whatever we had we™d co
ver her up. She™d sit there 
shivering and then finally 
after awhile she would Œ

my  memo r y  o f  Œ  o f  my  mo th er fro m all th at
 period is that picture of her, you know, 
frozen, sitting there. She lost Œ she Œ one 
Œ her finger was frostbitten, she had Œ had 
to be amputated. So, yeah. 
Q: What did she do? Wh
en  she was work ing there, what did she do? 
A: I Œ from what I understand, she was 
making some kind of ammunition, you 
know. I Œ I guess, you know, th-they weren'
t supposed  to pass on any in formation, 
but she was making some kind of mi Œ amm
unition. She was Œ it was a fact Œ it was 
a factory, you know.  

Q: Did she have any energy left ove
r to give to you as a little kid? 
A: Not at all, no, she Œ 
you know, I mean, the day wa
s basically Œ her day was 
basically she™d get up in the mo rning, go 
to work, you know, co
me back from work, 
you know, after many, many h
ours, tired as, you know, ma
ke some thing to eat, you 
know, and th en fine Œ and fall asleep, and Œ 
Q: The same thing repeated in Œ 
A: Œ same Œ exactly, you know. That wa Œ that was Œ 

Q: And when you Œ wh at was your day 
like? When  did you get up? Did you get up 
before her, after her? 

A: Yeah, we were all up at the same 
ti me, y ou know, beca
use everybody Œ the 
barracks emptied out, you know, everybody ha
d to go out either to school or to 
work , you know, and th e Œ the barracks were Œ 

Q: And did you walk  to school by yourself? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0557 
20
 
 
A: No, th Œ well, there were other kids th
at wi Œ you know, but yeah, and we™d  walk 
to school, you know, and Œ 
Q: So, in  other word s, when  she went Œ she went to wo rk and you were on your 
own until she came home? 

A: Exactly, yeah, yeah. That™s all. 

Q: Were you hungry? 
A: Oh, I was Œ that was the big thing, you 
know, that was, you know, as I say, my  Œ 
my two major memories of Œ of that period are Œ are first one, it was the cold, and 

the second one was the hung
er, you know, I mean tha Œ 
I was always hungry. My 
mo ther Œ it Œ now, you may not
 be familiar with the way 
they operated in Œ in  the Œ 
in the work camps, but basically the pe
ople would Œ who wo rked  in the camps 
would get paid basically in potatoes, and 
flour, you know, that was Œ that was the 
staple. And Œ and once a month they would, 
you know, deliver this
 sack of potatoes 
and you know, sack th Œ a sm
all sack of flour, and that was what you had to live on, 
you know, with Œ with the exception of
 if you exceeded a quota Œ you know, 
everybody had Œ had a quota to perform. 
If you exceeded  the quota you got s Œ an 
additional staple, you know. And my moth
er, every couple of weeks she Œ she™d 
bring, you know, back a Œ a black bread that she got fo r Œ 

Q: I was gonna ask you, yeah
, did you get bread, did yo
u get any cheese ever, or Œ 
A: Occasionally we™d get cheese, you kn
ow. Every once in 
awhile the Russians 
transport would be Œ transpor
ts would come in and the Ru ssians would distribute it 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0557 
21
 
 
throughout that camp, and then  they would 
distribute it. You know,
 they Œ they tried 
very hard to  Œ to provide the pe Œ food 
for the people, but the war was raging, and I 
guess the Œ the front got the 
first aspect of it, you know
. Bu t yeah, whenever Œ you 
know, I Œ I remember very di
stinctly every once in awhile these tru cks showing up, 
you know, and ev erybody got a piece of chee
se, or everybody got a piece of salami, 
you know. and yeah, yeah. And 
that Œ that Œ that occurred.
 But for the most part, my 
Œ you know, as I say, my 
mother, she was very industr
ious, you know. She would 
find roots, and Œ and Œ and le
aves you know, and she™d make
 root pancak es, or leaf 
pancakes. Every once in awhile she™d chop
 up a root, you know, an-and leaves, you 
know, so Œ yeah
. We Œ we Œ 
Q: I mean, the poor wo man had to keep  herself and you alive. 
A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

Q: It™s Œ it-it™s a Œ it™s really quite amazing. 
A: Yeah, that™s right. Now this, you know, 
as I say, I Œ I Œ I Œ when Œ when I Œ 
somebody asks me about this, 
you know, a-and I™ll say, I™ll tell you my  story, but 
it™s really not my story, it™
s my  mother™s story, you 
know. She™s the one that Œ 
without her, I would have had no chance wh
atsoever. She™s the one that Œ you know 
Œ 

Q: How long did this go on? 
A: For almo st four and a half
 years, throughout the war. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0557

Q: So from Œ from Œ so it™s not mo re than 
Œ i-if you got there in 19 Œ wh at Œ wh at™d 
you say, ™42? 
A: ‚42 to  ™45, yeah, you know, so yeah. Wa
 Œ it was three years.
 Yeah, three years. 
Q: So you were in Œ so you
 were in that camp for as long as the war lasted? 
A: Throughout the war, yes. 
Q: And when you were ther
e, do you recall your feelings as a child? Did you feel 
fear, did you feel any safety, did you feel 
Œ yeah, i Œ was it when she came back in 
the evenin g that somehow or other, okay, thin
gs are best again, she™s back, or Œ can 
you recall anything like that? 

A: I don™t Œ no, I can™t recall that. I Œ I ju
st Œ just don™t rememb er any, you know, 
great times, you know. The only Œ the onl
y good time that I rememb er from the Œ 
from the camp, you know, was Œ was when
 the camp  commander would tu rn on th e 
ra Œ the loudspeakers, and the radio would 
come on. And that was, I Œ I rememb er 
the best Œ the best of a Œ of everything 
that happened in  Œ throughout the camp, you 
know, as radio Œ 
Q: What would come on there? 
A: The what? 
Q: What would come on th e radio ther
e, what was there, music, or Œ 
A: There™d be the Œ the Œ well, yeah, for th
e mo st part there would be Œ first there™d 
be the news, you know, of, you know, the 
Œ the Russian front is mo ving, you know, 
and the Russians are winning an
d all that kind of stuff. An
d then Œ then there would 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0557 
23
 
 
be patriotic songs and melodies, you know, 
and th at wou Œ that always made me 
feel good, you know, the Œ the Œ th e 
songs and the melodies, you know, and Œ 
Q: Did you make any friends in the camp ? 
A: Yeah. The Œ you know, it Œ well, I had 
that incident with Œ with  Œ you know, 

when they first discovered I was Jewish, a
nd they Œ they starte
d teasing me and Œ 
and beating me up, you know. 
But that didn™t last too lo
ng. You know, I mean, i t Œ 
it dissipated and I Œ I had a couple 
of friends, you know, they were Œ 
Q: Was this the first time that you rea lized there was something different about 

you? 
A: Yeah, I didn't  know what was going on 
except for the fact, 
you know, wh en they 
started teasing, you know, I Œ you know, 
as I said, my memories of Judaism Œ 
although my  f Œ my  grandfather was a Ort
hodox Jew. And the picture in here, you 
can Œ you can see, is Œ well, some place 
I™ve seen that he is wearing a yarmulke
,
 
you know, so he was an Ort
hodox Jew and Œ and my  mother 
told me that Œ that they 
were Orthodox, that her parents were Or
thodox. My  father was not, you know, from 
what Œ what she told me, he Œ he was not
 religious. But, you 
know, an-and Œ and 
but I had very few memories of a 
young ch ild, in th Œ you know, a Œ 
Q: Yes. 
A: Œ attending a Œ a Œ a event of some ki
nd yet. And so wh en Œ wh en they first 
started teasing me and 
calling me, you know Œ 
Q: 
Jude.

know, so Œ but yeah. 

Q: What did she try Œ do you 
rememb er anything of Œ of 
what her explan ation was? 
A: You know, th-that something Œ you know,
 I Œ I Œ I rememb er her saying Œ saying 
something about anti-Semitism,
 but she didn™t use the wo

no, I can™t really recollect the exac

Q: Do you reme mb er Œ do 
you remember if it comforted you? I mean, the Œ the 
telling her, and her having some response, did that somehow or other, at least for 

that mo me nt, okay, put it in a frame, gave you so me Œ some comf ort or anything 

like that? 
A: Yeah, I just don™t remember. 
You know, that Œ 
that Œ that Œ 
Q: You don™t remember. I know, these

A: Yeah, yeah. 
Q: Œ seven Œ you know, almo st Œ 
A: Yeah, just don™t rememb er it, you kn

thought about it in that way.  
Q: Was there any sense at that time Œ or 
maybe she told you la
ter, that there was 
something particular going on 
with Jews, that Œ either in 
Poland
 or in
 Russia
, was 
Œ was there a sense that there Œ ther
e™s Œ there™s a particular danger? 
A: Oh yeah, you know, I mean
 when Œ wh en  Œ right after the war ended, you know, 
the Œ and we came back to 
Poland
, to Œ to 
Sa rny ,

Q: And how were the a Œ so Œ but 
I mean, still in that work camp Œ 
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: Œ while you were still there before th

ng Œ you know, when 
the Œ when this inci Œ did it happen 
mo re than once, this incident, was Œ 
A: Oh yeah, yeah. 
Q: A lot. 
A: This went on Œ when  it 
Œ wh en the first Œ I don™t kno
w how they found out that 
we were Jewish, but someb
ody Œ you know, somebody Œ 
Q: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0557 
26
 
 
A: Œ mu st have told the kids, and Œ and th
ey  started picking on me. And that went 
on fo r a period of time, and 
Œ you know Œ you know, it go
t Œ first couple of days 
was pretty bad, you know, and then  Œ then
 it dissipated as time went on. And, you 
know, after awhile it just wa
s Œ stopped, you know. So Œ 
Q: But during this time, in the Œ in the 
work  camp , there was no sense, or no talk 

that you could recall amongst the grownups th
at there was something particular that 
was happening to th e Jews? Or do you recall that? 

A: No, we th Œ for one thing,
 we really didn™t know wh
at was happening. We were, 
you know, all the way in the
 Ural 
mountains, you know, wh
ere Œ a-and th e only 
information we had was that Œ the radio th
at would co me on, and of course, that 

wouldn™t be on there. 

Q: The 
Gorky
(ph) family, were they 
Œ were they easy to be
 with, even though they 
were strangers, or was this difficult? 
A: Yeah, yeah, they™d Œ you
 know, the mother 
worked hard, like 
the same as my 
mo ther, and Œ you know, the 
Œ the boy was my age, so we were friends, you know, 
and we had chores that we
 would do togeth er, and we 
would do ye Œ you know, 

like, for example, we had the buckets, th
e waste bucket in each room. And in th e 
mo rning, you know, he would take the 
ba Œ waste bucket up one day and I would 
take it out the next day, take it to the pits
, you know, and get rid or it, and so yeah, 
we Œ we were friends, you know, yeah. 
Q: Did Œ did anybody 
ever steal your fo od? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0557 
27
 
 
A: No, I don™t rememb er of us Œ an incide
nt stealing food, but that was, you know, 
punishab le by death.  
Q: Even in a work camp? 
A: Yeah, you know, you steal some
body else™s food, 
you know, you Œ 
Q: You™re not going to  surviv e. 

A: You™re not going to  surviv e, you know, so

you could return to 
Poland
? Once you were in the 
Ural 
mountains, what happened after the war Œ 
A: Well, when the war fini
shed, everybody started Œ yo
u know, th ey didn™t need 
any mo re wo rkers in the Œ in the Œ you kn
ow, th-they Œ so ever
ybody started going 
home, and took us mo nths 
and months of walking and 
catching rides, and Œ and Œ 
and Œ 
Q: So, you had no train 
transportation, you Œ was all on your own energy? 
A: Yeah, pretty mu ch so, because you kn
ow, you got Œ I don™t 
know, the camp was 
so gigantic, I would say at least 50 
- 100,000 people there, you know. And 
everybody was going th eir own way. And, 
you know, of course you couldn™t do it 
in the winter, you know, but su Œ as s
oon as the spring came, you know, the Œ a 
couple of months of sist Œ 
of summer that occurred in the
 Ural 
mountains, 
everybody started going home. You know, an
d of course, you know, there™s Œ just 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0557 
28
 
 
weren™t enough trains, or I don™t know, th
ere weren™t any trains that were taking 
people home, you know, but yeah
, people started walking home. 
Q: So, do you rememb er that, do you 
remember when you left the camp? 
A: I remem Œ I remember wal Œ well, not ex
actly when I left th
e camp. I remember 
walking and I rememb er, you know, places we 
used to Œ some places we stopped, I 
remember, and you know, and I remember, 
y-you know, like the Œ when  we Œ when  
we got to the Œ to Œ to certain places, 
you know, we™d  stop a-a-an-and go to bombed 
out houses, or Œ or de
stroyed places, and go into those 
and sleep in there, and try to, 
you know, and walk
 the next day. 
Q: Did you Œ 
A: And there were Œ 

Q: How™d you feed yourselves? 

A: The what? 
Q: How™d you feed yourselves 
on such a long journey home? 
A: Yeah, and th ere Œ you know
, as I say, there was always Œ there was always some 
kind of a barter system that was going on
. You know, people ke
pt bartering, you 
know, and I don™t know if there Œ it was 
Œ it was the nearby farms, or wh at, you 
know? The Œ the nearby areas that there Œ but there was always Œ so I remember, 
you know, every once in awh
ile we™d Œ we™d  catch a ride, you know, or if Œ you 
know, and Œ and I remember one time we we
re on a train, on a ca
ttle car, and we™d 
stopped at this station, and there was a 
Œ another train, th-t
he next Œ the next

railroad track, and were all Russian soldie
rs, they were return
ing from Œ from the Œ 
you know, from the war, basically. A lot of 
them were, you know, bandaged  up and 
etcetera, but they Œ I remember th at distinc
tly, but th Œ at that point my  mo ther and 
the Russian soldiers were sel ling cans of 
fat, you know, that 
chicken Œ you know, I 
mean, animal fat. And my mother Œ and it 
would Œ they weren't 
closed cans, they 
were cans that were Œ they filled up with
 fat, you know. And my mother somehow 
bartered with one of the sold
iers for this small can of Œ of what Œ lard, I guess, you 
know, it was Œ and she you n Œ gave up wh at
ev er she had and she bought this small 
can of Œ of lard. And you kn
ow, soon as the trains left
, y ou know, my Œ my mother 
started making Œ she had Œ  
Q: Something with it. 

A: Œ grabbed it Œ with Œ started Œ and it tu
rned  out there was only an inch of Œ of 
lard, and the rest was all potatoes, you 
know, pota Œ you know, mashed potatoes, 
that stuff. 

Q: Oh. 

A: Yeah, that was a disappointi
ng event. Very disappointing. 
Q: To be tricked like that. 
A: Yeah, yeah, you know. But, you kno
w, it was rough times, rough times. 
Q: And was there much contact Œ I mean, as
ide from finding a place to sleep, and a 
place to Œ a-and something to eat, do you ha

going Œ yeah, I guess it may have been the 
Ukra ine
, I™m no Œ I™m not quite sure 
that Œ of the route, you know, what routes we took. 
Q: Because, I Œ I guess what I™m lead
ing up to is that, if it was the 
Ukraine
, then 
you were passing through some of the wors
t ravaged areas, where Œ where the war 
was, you know, had been particularly brutal. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: And of course, the massacres of Jews Œ 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Œ were particularly brutal. 
A: Right.

because it was just too cold 
Q: And th Œ and Œ an d the war ended May 
n Œ May ninth, I believe it was, so Œ 
A: Right, yeah. So, yeah, it 
was shortly after the war ended. Must have been ju l Œ 
June or July or something like that, that 
I would say, because we were there for a 
period Œ the little period longer afte
r the war ended, you know, s-so Œ 
Q: And you were already nine, right? 
A: I was nine, yeah in Œ it™s right, yeah.

A: Yeah. 

Q: Once they got to the sovi 
Œ then they couldn't leave the
 Soviet Unio n. 
A: No, we Œ we got there, you know, an-a

street, but the buildings were all d estroye

was, you know. And sh e kept running ar
ound you know, and 
Œ and you know, she 
was in very disheveled and 
upset, you know, that she c
ouldn™t find the house. And 
you know, I guess finally she 
got oriented and came to 
where she thought the house 
was, but it wasn™t there any more, it was 
destroyed, everything 
was destroyed, you 
know 
[indecipherable]

A: Yeah, I Œ you know, I Œ I heard so
me of the stuff from Œ from you know,

uld be with her, you know. 
Q: Okay . 
A: And Œ 
Q: Do you have any partic
ular memories of that? 
A: Not really. Not really.

build ing, and we found a corner in  that 
building, you know, and there were other 
families all over, too. And we
 were there for, I don™t k
now, for a period of time, I 
don™t know exactly how long. There was Œ 
well, what was also happening at the 
same time is that, I guess some of the Zionis
ts were trying to organize people to  go 
to Œ to 
Palestine
, to go to
 Israel,
 you know. And so , there was an organizing affect 
going on at the Œ at the same time, so we
 got Œ we got involved with those people, 
with those Œ an-and bega
n our jo urney to Œ to 
Austria
,
 
you know, to the Œ 
Q: So you Œ you first went to 
Palestine
 before coming to the 
United States
? 
A: No, no, no, no, no. 

Q: No? Okay. 
A: No, wha-what happened is that we Œ 
what Œ what these guys, these people, the 
organizers were doing is getting people in
to displaced person camps, into the 
DP
 
camps. So a Œ then the 
DP
 camp for Œ for the Œ
 Israel
, was in 
Hallein
 by
 Sa lzburg ,
 
near 
Salzburg
, you know. And so  we began the journey thro ugh to Œ to 
Hallein
, 
and you know, that to
ok months also, you know, I mean, there was 
[indecipherable]
 stops and walk, you know, some Œ 
some walking, some Œ but that 
was mo re organized, you know, it had Œ th
ey would have truc
ks occasionally, and 
they would have trains occasi
onally, yeah. And there was fr Œ 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0557

Q: So there was no reas Œ yeah, ther
e was no reason for her to stay in Œ 
A: No, no, no after Œ you kn
ow, after a period of time, 
we were there, you know, 
she Œ she Œ you know, the fa
mily is gone, you know. Bu
t she Œ she Œ you know, she 
knew that she had two sisters though, in th e 
United States, 
you know, so Œ but you 
know, it took a long time
 
Œ well, until we got Œ when we 
got into Œ into south sp Œ 
into
 Hallein
, we finally got involved with
 UNRRA
, and th-the Œ you know, and th e 
people wh o Œ who were trying to 
find others, you know, a-and so Œ 

Q: It™s Œ it™s a Œ I mean, you we
nt from one set of mountains, the 
Ural
 mountains Œ 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Œ to an other set of mountains, the 
Alps. 
A: Exactly, yeah. 
Q: You know? The area around 
Salzburg
 is really quite beautiful. 
A: It is, yeah, very nice.  
Q: And Œ and Œ and yet, the ci
rcumstances are anything but.  
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: When  did the food improve? 
A: The what? 
Q: When  did food improve, that you would be
 able to have enough to eat, that you 
didn™t feel hungry. 
A: Oh, i-i-it Œ it Œ well, that Œ that never Œ well, until we got to 
Hallein
, it Œ it 
didn™t. You know, I mean, we kept gettin
g more, but it was Œ it was always the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0557 
35
 
 
hoard ing, you know, carrying 
whatever you could in your 
pockets, you know, and Œ 
and Œ and when  we finally got to the 
DP
 camp in
 Hallein
, you know, it was 
originally  run by the Œ by th e army, you Œ 
U.S. 
Army , and th ey had the Œ the 
gigantic kitchens, you know, 
and all the Œ all the food that you could eat, you know, 
and Œ 

Q: That was the first time. 
A: That was Œ that was the beginning, ye
ah. That was the good life, you know. 
Q: How long were you there? 
A: Almost four years. 
Q: Oh my . That™s a long time. 
A: Yes, yes. 

Q: And this was all Œ
 Hallein
 was by 
Salzburg
? 
A: Yeah, it is by 
Sa lzburg
, mm-h m.  
Q: So, did you go to  
school there too? 
A: Yeah, what Œ what was happening in Œ 
in Œ you know, in th
e camps, you know, 
is Œ is Œ because we were in a camp
 that was designated to Œ for Œ for 
Israel
, you 
know, everybody had to  learn Hebrew, ev
erybody had to lear
n a job. So, my  
mo ther, she was going to school to become
 a seamstress, you know, I was attending 
a school in Œ totally in Hebrew, everythi
ng was spoken in Hebrew, etcetera. And Œ 
you know, so everybody had to
 become productive, you k
now, and Œ to be ready for 
Œ to go to 
Israel. 
And, so yeah, that was Œ that was a tremendous improvement 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0557 
36
 
 
comp ared to Œ to ev erything else, you kno
w. The army  provided us with clothes, 
they provided Œ I mean, the 
UNRRA
, at the end provided us
 with cl-clothes and 
food and, you know. We had movi
es, I rememb er movies, you know Œ 
Q: What were the movies? 
A: Y-You know, the exact movie I don™
t remember, but I remember cowboy 
pictures, you know. 
Q: Okay . 
A: You know, you know. And 
something like, you know, I think it might have been 
a 
John Wayne
 movies or something like th at, you know 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: But you know, it™s really unusual, 
I don™t know how many people would have 
been in a camp, a 
work camp in the 
Urals
 Œ 
A: Mm-hm. 

Q: Œ you know, and at the same ti me
 at a Œ for three or four years. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: And then  after that end up in  a camp  run by the 
U.S. 
Army and 
UNRRA
 Œ 
A: Right. 
Q: Œ you know, near the 
Alps
 Œ 
A: Right. 
Q: Œ for another three or four years. 
A: Yeah, yeah. 
Q: So the 40s were basica
lly spent in camps, and wa
lking between those camp s. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0557 
37
 
 
A: Exactly, exactly. Yeah, yeah. 
Q: And what about Œ what about in Œ in th
is camp ? I mean, clearly, because it was Œ 
it was more  Jewish Œ 

A: Mm-hm, only Jewish. 

Q: Œ you wouldn™t be picked
 on because you were Œ 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Œ you Œ but were there Œ was it frie
ndly, was it warmer, was it more accepting? 
Was it Œ or did it have its
 own difficulties as well? 
A: You know, I mean like Œ like any 
bureaucracy, and there were buroc Œ 
bureaucracies there, you know, you had to follow certain rules and regulations, you 
know, but that was Œ that was a good life for me, you know. I Œ I rememb er e Œ 

attending school, and meeting a lot of ki
ds my  age, you know, and Œ and ru nning 
around and doing pranks
 and Œ and en-enjoying my se
lf, you know. Then , I was Œ 
that was  

Q: And were the grownups talking abou
t wh at had just happened in  the war? 
A: They Œ they Œ you
 know, they  didn™t talk mu ch ab
out it at all, you know, I me an 
they were ju st kind of tight-lipped, yo
u know, very, very  hard to get over. They  

would Œ you know, they  would do a lo
t of, as they say in Yiddish, 
kha sen
(ph), you 
know, they would say Œ that sigh. They  
would sigh, and Œ an
d look at each other 
and say Œ you know, and sa
y th ings that Œ they u
nderstood each other. They 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0557 
38
 
 
understood what had transpir
ed. You didn™t have to di
scuss it, you know. And so, 
yeah, it™s not Œ my  Œ 
Q: And so th at yo Œ it wasn™t like as kids
 you could pick up on
 some conversations 
that were transpiring and Œ and Œ 
and kind of hear it that way. 
A: Yeah, wasn™t much of that
 going on, you know, I mea n , 
just they didn™t want to 
talk about it, you know, as th
ey Œ I mean, my  mo ther very seldom talked about it, 
you know, so Œ you know, ev
ery once in awhile was Œ 
Q: She mu st have had such a hard time. 
A: Yeah, you know, every onc
e in  awhile you know, something wh at happened, and 
it™s Œ would offset people, and say, oh
, not that Nazi situation, you know 
[indecipherable]
 and Œ but for the most part, that 
wasn™t Œ wasn™t discussed. So Œ 
Q: When  did you Œ where did Œ wh ere did you go from from 
Hallein? 
A: Well, while we were Œ we came to the 
United States, 
but actually we Œ we went 
to 
Germany
 first, you know, and we went ou
t of Œ we took a ship  out of 
Bremenhaven
(ph). But what had transpired is
 that my mother, you know, at 
UNRRA
, and that was able to find my mother™s
 two sisters, and Œ and the Œ in Œ in 
the 
United States, 
a-and they immediately sent 
us visas, you know, and Œ 
Q: Where did they live? 

A: Well, one of them was in 
Boston, 
and one was in 
New York City
. But I-I 
reme mb er that day, you know, then  Œ when
 Œ when  Œ when we 
got that letter from 
the, I-I guess through 
UNRRA
, you know, we got a letter from the 
United States,
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0557 
39
 
 
and my  au nts, you know, they fo und my  aunts, you know.
 
And  my  mo th er was so  
excited. I remember she was dancing, sh
e was jump ing, you know, she was so Œ 
that was the Œ the Œ 
Q: Well, it was the first feast of
 Œ first piece of good news Œ 
A: That™s right, the first Œ 

Q: Œ in years.  
A: Œ that™s ri Œ exactly. You know, I Œ I Œ 
you know, I have such a vivid memo ry of 
her jumping around and da
ncing, you know, I-I hadn™t 
seen her in Œ you know, 
never saw her dancin g and jump ing ar
ound, you know. Sh
e Œ she was just 
overjoyed. But yeah , that was Œ 
Q: Was she wa Œ was she normall y  Œ 
I mean, normally, what could one say 
normally? Was she a happy person? 

A: You know, I th Œ th Œ sh
e Œ she kept her spirits up, 
but I Œ you know, ha Œ th ere 
wa Œ there wasn™t any occasion 
for her to dance, or Œ or Œ 
Q: I understand. 

A: Œ or Œ or to be happy ab
out, you know, I mean, she was Œ 
Q: Even Œ even in asking that question, I 
realize that the circumstan ces, ha Œ who 
would be happy during any of this? 

A: Right, but Œ 
Q: But you know, there Œ there are pe
ople who Œ who have an optimistic 
disposition, and people wh
o are Œ have a sadder 
disposition. That was Œ 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0557 
40
 
 
A: Yeah. No, she was more optim
istic, I would say, you know Œ 
Q: But, it sounds Œ 
A: Œ a Œ you know, she™s Œ 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Yeah, yeah, she definitely, you know, I 
mean she kept saying,
 you know, this too 
will pass, you know, this too will pass, 
you know. Do-Don™t Œ d
on™t Œ don™t worry, 
we™ll have better times, you know. 

Q: It sounds like she had to be so strong. 

A: Oh, sure. 
Q: I mean, how else coul
d she have survived  Œ 
A: Exactly. 
Q: Œ and with Œ an
d Œ and with you Œ 
A: Exactly, yeah. 
Q: Œ as well, you know, as a little boy?  
A: Exactly. 

Q: And so, from the time you 
got the letter, that meant th
en you also had the ab ility 
to get to the 
United States
, and you didn™t Œ 
A: Well, they immediately sent us Œ we
ll, immediately, I don™t know how mu ch  
time transpired, but they sent us a visa right away, you know, for the 
United States
, 
and we said Œ we thought, well, 
next month we™re going to Œ to 
United States
. Of 
course, we di-didn™t know about the quota. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0557 
41
 
 
Q: Okay . 
A: 
United States
 had a quota, you know, for onl
y a certain amount of people from 
each country of origin, yo
u know, and the Polish Œ 

Q: Quota. 

A: Œ quota was in Œ very long, the list was 
very long, and we just had to wait, you 
know, 
United States
 was allowing a 
smedgling
(ph)
 
of people to come in from each 
country. And so  Œ so we wa
ited all that time to come. 
Q: And ni Œ and so it was actually she go
t the letter fairly soon, and then it was 
another couple of years before 
you could leave, was that it? 
A: Yeah, yeah, you know, there™s a 
Œ well, we came here in ™51. 
Q: Oh, wow. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: And you were in that
 camp from ™46 or ™47? 
A: ™46 - ™47 to ™51 almost, yeah. 
Q: That™s a long time. 

A: Yeah, yeah. 
Q: Going through 
Germany
 Œ 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Œ do you have any recollec
tions of what that was like Œ 
A: N-No Œ 

Q: Œ to get to 
Bremerhaven? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0557 
42
 
 
A: Well, yeah, it™s just Œ it™s just Œ you 
know, ha Œ th-the Œ the horrible feeling 
inside, you know, I mean here Œ here is 
the country th at destroyed your family, 
destroyed Œ you know, so Œ but there wasn
™t much discussion again, you know, and 
again, what happened is
 that we came out of 
Hallein
 by, I-I Œ I think was trucks, an-
and got to another camp close by. And we 
were there six months befo re we could 
even get on a ship. You know, so
 you know, finally, we got on th e 
SS
 
Stewart

Q: Oh, really? 

A: Oh yeah, still have all the documentati

 the picture of my 
mo ther and me, you know, and Œ and I left out
 that my  mother got remarried in the 
camp, so when I was Œ when  I was 13 I had my  Bar Mitzvah in th e camp , you

know the name of the camp, 
you know, but I have Œ a-a

with the partisans for about two and a half
 years or three years he was with the

ese experiences? 
A: No, no, room Œ as I say, people Œ 
Q: They didn't. 
A: Œ people didn™t talk, you know, they

 And th e summer yet, you know, so I Œ I had the summer, and

A: Œ went to school, yeah, you know. I 
had a rough time because I wasn™t speaking 
English yet, you know, and I had some Œ my
 Œ my  Œ one of my  cousins, she spoke 
Yiddish, you know, and I 
Œ so she took me to 
Tilden
 High School to register me for 
high school, because I was almost 16, yo
u know. So Œ and we 
went to Œ to one 
office, you know, and th en they  kept talk
ing, and Œ and they 
kept asking her, how 
old is he, you know. And sh e asked me 
in Yiddish  the first time, you know, how 
old, you know. So I tell her I™m going to 
be 16 in  February, and she would say it to 
them Œ 

Q: Translate. 

A: Œ translate it, you know. And after awhile 
they send us to another office, and the 
same questions came up, you know, she said 
again, he™s gonna be 16 in February. 
And about the third office, you know, the 
same thing happened, you know. I mean, 

I don™t know why we kept going from office
 to office, but they kept sending us 
from, you know, I guess different interviews. 
And finally I said, he™s gonna be 16 in 
February. So , yeah, you know. 
Q: So, a bit of bureaucracy to get into school. 
A: Right, right, well they Œ yo
u know, they  didn™t Œ they had 
[indecipherable]
 you 
know, they didn™t

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0557 
47
 
 
Q: How did your mo ther™s life evolve then , in the 
United States
? 
A: You know, she was Œ she was quite hap
py. You know, I mean, my  father and I Œ 
my stepfather and I, rather a-and Œ no-not I,my fath Œ my gran Œ my stepfather and 
she worked all the time, you 
know, and they work
ed in the same fa
ctory, so they 
had co mmon Œ you know, they  Œ th ey Œ they
 traveled togethe
r, they came back 
together and they got along well. We Œ 
you know, all the cousins and stuff, you 
know, tried to give us mo ral support as mu
ch as Œ as possible, so we™d see them 
quite often, we™d go to different families,
 you know, so yeah, sh
e di Œ she Œ she did 
all right, she Œ 

Q: Did th ey stay in 
Brooklyn
? 
A: They stayed in 
Brooklyn,
 yeah , through th e Œ you 
know, so I Œ yeah, and Œ 
Q: And did Œ did th e Œ when  Œ did the que
stion of wh at had happened during Wo rld 

War II every come up in those years? 
A: Yeah, I guess the Œ there mu st have 
been discussions, because my mo ther, I 
remember all the adults sitti
ng around the table, you know, in Œ in  my  aunt™s house, 
you know, and sitting around th
e table, and they were as
king her questions, what 
happened  to  so and so, what happened 
to so  and so? And sh
e wa Œ always, you 
know, from what I overheard, you know, I wa sn™t part of the conversation, but she 
always would say the same 
thing, you know, I mean, I 
don™t know, you know. All I 
know is that they™re not around any mo re
. They™re Œ they™re not
 Œ you know, and Œ 
and whatever information she gathered
, you know, from wh
en  we were in 
Sarny
, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0557 
48
 
 
that there was no documentation or anythi
ng to Œ you know. Th
e only Œ the only 
documentation, and the reason my  mo ther 
was able to get remarried, is because 
there was the person that saw my father at 
Stalingrad
, sh e was able to get ahold of 
Œ and Œ an d he wrote a letter which was accepted by Œ 
Q: That™s she™s actually a widow. 

A: And that she™s a widow, right, you 
know. So, that was the only Œ an-and Œ you 
know, documentation that we Œ I still have
 that, as a matter of fact, you know, in 
[indecipherable]
 the Œ the American government wa
s kind of lenient, you know, on 
documentation at that point, because they Œ 
they knew the situatio
n, they knew what 
was Œ was available, and you know, what 
was available and what wasn™t, you know, 

so I mean Œ so Œ 

Q: Did you get on w

know. 

Q: Was he a Œ was Œ did he fill in at l
east some o Œ a role of somebody who Œ 

A: Well, you know, it Œ you know, he was Œ I don™t know. I seemed to be self-
sufficient all the time, you know, I Œ I Œ I 
didn™t have many Œ how would I say? The 
feeling requirements that some peopl
e have, you know, I Œ I didn™t Œ I Œ 
Q: Well, it sounded like you were forced 
to be resourceful from the time you were 
at the camp  in Œ in Œ in the
 Urals. 
A: Yeah, pretty much so

Q: And how long Œ how lo ng 
did your mom still live in 
Brooklyn
? 
A: She Œ she lived until she passe d away 10 years ago, she Œ 
Q: Oh. 
A: Yeah, mm-hm. 

Q: So a good, long time. 

A: Yeah, mm-hm. 
Q: Did she ever go in to any de
tail about wh at had gone on? 
A: No. Never did, you know, I mean s Œ 
I say Œ you know, after she passed away 
and we started doing a genealogy, my  wife
 and I, and I kept sa
ying, why didn't I 
talk to her, you know? Cause 
that link Œ and as I say, we
 started writing to people 
and trying to  find out, and as a ma tter of fact
, we took trips to tr
y to talk to cousins 
who may have spoken to some
body, an-and try to gath er as mu ch as we could, and 
Œ and didn't get mu ch. 

Q: Why did Œ why did it beco
me interesting for you? Wh
y did it become important 
for you? 
A: You know, it is Œ it™s Œ it™s like you™re mi
ssing part of your Œ 
part of the chain, 
you know, you Œ you™ve
 Œ you™ve got history of some
 kind, you know and th en all 
of a sudden it™s broken. You Œ but specific
ally why did it become important? I don™t 
know, it™s just Œ it just 
[indecipherable]
 and I Œ just something in  me that needed to 
find out more, you know, and still do.

Q: And is there anything th at you did find out mo re? Even if it™s not enough, was 
there anything that you did find ou
t that you hadn™t known before? 
A: No, we had Œ you know, as
 I say to Œ just as a matte
r o f fact, recently I had 
gotten th e email from one of the people I™v
e been trying to get ahold of. Really 
haven™t found out anything about my  fathe
r, you know, I mean I just haven™t been 
able to make that connection. And all th
e people that I get a
hold of nowadays, you 
know, seem to be second generation or th
ird generation, and th
ey  don™t know what 
happened , you know, so when
 you try to find out well, are we cousins, distant 
cousins or something like that
, are you Œ how is the fami
ly tree over here? What is 
the Œ it just Œ it just Œ 

Q: It Œ somewhere it Œ 

A: Œ doesn™t Œ it doesn™t come true, it doesn
™t happen, you know. It just breaks up, 
you know, i-it just is
 Œ so I™ve been Œ 
Q: Have you Œ has there b
een any Œ I don™t know how th
e Œ the Russian services 
work , but do they have the kind of serv
ices where you™d be able to find out, you 
know, where was he stationed, or where Œ 
A: Yeah. No , they Œ they Œ you know, 
they were so diso
rganized, and their 
documentation was so horrible, and Œ and Œ 
and th ey buried people wherever th ey 
could, you know, I me an Œ and there 
was no documentation, you know, I mean 
there were trenches, and buri
ed in trenches an
d they didn™t know who they were 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0557 
51
 
 
burying, you know. So, yeah, no Œ no, I ha
ven™t been able to Œ you know Œ it™s Œ 
you know, so Œ 
Q: And no trips back to th
is part of the world? 
A: Well, yeah, and you know, and Œ we 
went Œ three years ago we went to 
Austria
, 
and I went specifically  to find 
Ha llein
. See, my  memo r y  o f  
Russia
 isn™t that strong 
any mo re, you know, but of 
Austria
 and
 Hallein
 it still is, you know, and th en the Œ 
and we went to 
Hallein
 and tried to find where Œ we knew the camp  is gone, you 
know, I mean, but we tried 
to find where it was. And 
we kept going from Œ from 
one office to another, where was the camp
, etcetera, an-and Œ and I Œ nobody knew, 
you know. And finally I 
went to this one travel agent, you know, travel bureau, and 
went to them, you know, and th en kept talk
ing to the people in
 Œ at the desk, you 
know, and somebody in  the back , a young la
dy in the back h
eard our discussion. 
And she finally says, oh yes, yeah, it was an 
Juden
 camp. You know, she Œ she 
knew about the Œ Grandfather had told me 
about this Jew camp  Œ Jewish camp that 
used to be here. And it was on so and so 
strasse
, you know, and Œ and th ere™s a 
little plaque someplace now, where the camp
 was. You know, so we went looking 
for the camp, we never Œ wen Œ or for this
 Œ for the plaque, you know, never found 
it. 

Q: Well Œ you never 
found the plaque? 
A: No, she Œ she wasn™t that exact. She 
Œ sh e thought it was, you know, on so and 
so street, but it could have been 
on another street, you know, and Œ 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0557 
52
 
 
Q: And so it™s built over. 
A: Yeah, totally, you know, it™s all 
[indecipherable]
 buildings that 50 or 60 years 
later, you know. 
[inaudible] 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Yeah, yeah, so Œ yeah. 

Q: Is there anything from this that yo
u would like to add from what I™ve Œ you 
know, from what we™ve talked about? Is 
there anything I have
n™t asked that you 
think is important to be a part of this interview? 

A: Can™t think of anything sp
ecific. The Œ you know, the thi
ng th at is Œ is Œ is Œ that 
the hatred, you know, to over
come all that hatred is ju
st, you know, I-I Œ that people 
would do that to Œ to each other is just 
unbelievable, you know, and it™s just hard Œ 
Q: Is it something you had 
inside for a long time? 

A: You know, I guess, you know, I mean th
-the Œ the Œ th-the 
thing from the Œ from
 
Ryev ka
(ph), the thing that still sta
nds out in my mind is that
 incident with the kids, 
you know, of them taunting me a
nd Œ and Œ and calling me, you know, 
evra
(ph) Œ 
zh id , 
you know, and Œ and Œ 
Q: Which is a terrible Œ in Œ in
 Russian it™s a terrible epithet. 
A: Yeah, you know, so th Œ th
at kind of hatred Œ and I Œ and I knew the kids were Œ 
didn™t know what they were doing, y
ou know, but somehow that was passed on to  
them, you know? Because I don™t think th ey™v
e had that much in Œ in  Œ those young 
kids of Œ that had that mu ch exposure to 
Œ to Jews for them to
 know what to Œ to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0557 
53
 
 
even know that they should hate me, or 
why they hated me, you know, or why they 
kept calling me names. And I think that™s
 why it dissipated, because they didn™t 
really know, didn™t have the hatred, it 
was something that was passed onto them 
from Œ from their parents or Œ or Œ you know
, from adults, that it™s Œ it™s all right to 
pick on Jews, you know, and that thing. 
So  th at™s why I think it stopped after a 
period of time, because it wasn™t someth
ing that came from them, it was passed on 
to them. 
Q: But still, the circumstances couldn't ha
ve been Œ you know, you™re five and a 
half, six years old, something like that. Yo
ur mo ther was powerless to try and help 
you, she™s barely keeping alive. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: And in th e middle of a war, and you kno
w, and what is a 
young Œ what is a 
young kid to  do? 
A: Yeah. 
Q: You know? You Œ 

A: Yeah. 
Q: What is a young kid to do to  make  sense of it? You Œ you can™t not be 
vulnerable. 

A: That™s right. 
Q: In Œ in future Œ you know, as you 
grow older, you can try and build a wall 
around yourself a bit, but 
at that age, it™s just Œ 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0557 
54
 
 
A: Yeah, yeah.  
Q: Yeah, that™s what Œ that™s what that inexplicable sort of like 
he Œ what do you do 
with that? 
A: Yeah.  

Q: What do you do with  that? 

A: Yeah. Oh.  
Q: Has Œ you said you were at
 another conference before Œ 
A: Mm-hm. 

Q: Œ the one in 
Michigan
, and this is your second one. 
A: Right. 

Q: What did that give you? 

A: You know, I just Œ the idea that, you 
know, I™m not alone. There are others that 
have the same thoughts, you know, and mo
st of these people that are Œ you™ll Œ 
you™ll meet here, they™re trying to find out
 what they™ve missed
, you know, they  Œ 
you know, they™re trying to  find out Œ you kno
w, most of them Œ some of them were 
hidden ch ildren, they  don™t know what wa
s going Œ didn™t know wh at was going on, 
but they  know th ey lost something and th
ey  don™t know what it is, you know. And 
some of them, of course, are very damage
d by it, because they were old enough to 
understand. And so Œ 
Q: Do you have kids? 
A: Oh yeah, I have Œ 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0557 
55
 
 
Q: And Œ and Œ 
A: Œ I have four boys Œ 
Q: Œ and do they Œ are they curious, do they
 want to know, do they  explore, do they 
Œ you know, are they connected to this story? 
A: Yeah, y-y-you know. They
 Œ they Œ they  ask questio
ns, you know, mu ch mo re 
than I ever did of my moth
er and father, you know. So 
Œ so, yeah . Yeah, and Œ and 
one of our Œ I guess, you know, some things
 ya Œ are kind of 
passed on whether you 
like it or not, you know. I-I remember 
Œ I have four sons, you know, and I 
reme mb er 
Eric
, my  th Œ my  third son, one day,
 you know, we were going out to 
buy a Œ a car, and he was a 
young child yet, you know. 
And I remember we Œ we 
were looking at 
Vo lkswagens
, and he said, Dad, you™re not gonna buy a German 
car, are you? He was so upset about that, 
you know. You know, so he knew Œ na Œ 
unintentionally I-I convey
ed that feeling to him, which 
I didn™t intend to, you know. 
So, you know. 

Q: Well, some things are, you know Œ 

A: Yeah. 
Q: Œ they ™re kind of tough. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Have you ever been back to 
Germany
? 
A: Yeah, I™ve been a 
numb er of times back, but not 
for Œ you know, just primarily 
for business, yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0557 
56
 
 
Q: And was it difficult to be there? 
A: You know, 
Germany
 has got some very nice place
s to Œ to visit, etcetera, you 
know, and I kept concentrating on those, 
you know, rather than
 Œ and Œ and I did go 
to concen tration camps, and 
I did go Œ you know, we™ve be
en to a number of them. 
So, we got a feeling of th e horro r, and Œ and what tran
spired, you know, it just 

doesn ™t go away. It Œ it comes back to you 
regardless. But I Œ I Œ you know, I can™t 
Œ I Œ I can™t continue to Œ to have that fee
ling. I Œ I don™t want to have that feeling, 
you know, I Œ you know, the young
 kids that are coming out of 
Germany
, th ey had 
no part of it, you know, and so Œ a-an
-and hopefully we™r
e conveying enough 
information to them that th
ey  wo n™t mak e  th e  same mi
stakes, you know? So, yeah. 
Q: And 
Poland
? 
A: The what? 

Q: Did you back to 
Poland
? 
A: No, we™ve never gone 
Œ no, never went back to
 Poland
, you know. 
Q: 
[indecipherable]
 
A: I keep wanting to do that, 
but somehow, haven™t made it. 
Q: Well, these Œ the-these trips al
so, they take a lot out of one. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Not only out of your pocketbook
, but an awful lo
t out of one. 
A: Yes, right, right. 

Q: So you have to kind
 of prepare for them. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0557 
57
 
 
A: Right.  
Q: But you know, thank you. 
Thank you very mu ch fo r sh
aring to day. I Œ I very 
much appreciate it, and if there are any foll
ow up questions, I also appreciate that I 
might be able to get in touch with you Œ 

A: Sure, sure. 

Q: Œ and so on? 
A: Yeah, any time. 
Q: Thank you. 

A: You™re welcome.
