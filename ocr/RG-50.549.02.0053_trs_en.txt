Beginning Tape On e, Side A 
 
Question: United States Holocaust Memori
al Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection. 
This is an interview with Marsha Loen
, conducted by Regina Baier, on July  11
th
, 1999, in 
Mrs. Loen™s home. This is a follow up in
terview to a USHMM videotaped interview 
conducted with Marsha 
Loen, on November 5
th
, 1990. The United States Holocaust 
Memorial Museum gratefully acknowled
ges Jeff and Toby Herr for making this 
interview possible. This is tape numb er one, 
side A. So  my  first question is an easy one. 
Give us your name, and wh en 
were you bo -- or your name
s, and when you were born, 
and where. 
Answer: My name is Marsha Loen, Marsh 
Supporzhnikov Loen . My maiden name was 
Supporzhnikov. I was born in 
Lithuania, Kolnos. In fact
, the outskirts of Kolnos, 
Labotkia. And I was born 
in 1930, July 28.  
Q: And when did liberation come for you, and 
what was it like? What state of mind, what 
physical health were you in , and where were you? 
A: I was liberated in a silo after th e last 
march called Chinno, that a lot of ki -- little 
camps out of Stutthof were concen trated. An
d the two typhuses broke out. And to tell you 
the honest truth, I don™t reme mb er when  I 
was liberated. I though
t they were burning 
down the silo, so I covered myse
lf with straw, but there were
 people were left, the dead 
around me, and I woke up in a German house,
 with the Ru ssian™s doctor taking care of

me. I had the two ty phuses. And th en they  shav
ed my  head again, and th ey put a salve on 
it, and I looked like musselwoman. And I c
ould hard ly walk, or talk, or recognize 
anything. And after three days, or a week, I d
on™t know exactly, they 
told us we have to 
leave that village, because th
e front is coming on. So we 
should walk 
to Lomborg. 
Lomborg is in Polmarin. And it was not far from
 Chin no. And as we were walking, I with  
a little frien d of mine holding a hand, we sa
w two Russian soldiers, and I -- that I will 
never forget, and a two carriage -- two wheel 
carriage -- officers, and we asked them to 
take us to Lomborg, and you know we covere
d our head with -- with scarves, an d we -- 
they shouldn™t notice that we have typhus. A
nd th ey said, ﬁNo, we cannot do it, because 
we are not allowed to.ﬂ But th
ey felt so sorry for 
the two youngsters, 
that they put us 
behind, in that little carriage, but
 they said, ﬁThe first house 
in Lomborg, you have to get 
out.ﬂ So, as we came into Lomborg, the first ho use, they said in -- 
in Russian, out. So, we 
went out, and th e first house we walked in
. And all I can reme mb er is everything was 
empty, except there was a big, big rug, maybe a Persian rug, I don™t know, at that time I 

didn™t know from Persian rug, or China r
ug, or anything else. And in the middle was 
standing a bottle, with blueberries. And I di
dn™t know it was preserve, or something. 
There was no water in that hous
e, nothing. And we were still si
ck, I and that little girl, we 

had a temperature little bit, and we were -- we 
were really out. And 
sh -- she said, ﬁShall 
we drink it?ﬂ I said, ﬁI am afraid it may be
 poisoned.ﬂ Left poison, there™s that bottle 
standing there, there™s no water, there™s nothi
ng. And then we couldn™t stand it any mo re, 
and what happened is is we dr
ank, and we ate those blueberries. And at that time I was so

young, I didn™t know nothing. La
ter on I realized that we got up the next mo rning, and we 
felt so much better, that it was 
fermemented. It was set u p  fo
r wine, or something, and it 
helped the temperature. And our temperature 
dropped. We s -- we went around, and we 
looked around like scav
engers for food, and we found so
me food, and then I recognized 
some people from my  hometown, and they  wa
s already looking -- you know, after two 
weeks, three weeks, they™re gr
own up people. And they saw me
, it was like a lifesaver for 
them, because the Russians are going on the front
 to Lomborg, and th
ey were raping the 
women. German, Jewish, it didn™
t matter. They were getting drunk and raping them. So 
what they did is they -- they
 dragged me and that little girl
 into their apartment where 
they lived , six women. And if you put a sign 
up th at it™s typhus, the Russians didn™t care, 
they just tore it down and they came in, a
nd they made hia -- chaos. And wh at happened 
is -- is that whenever a Russi
an came in, they took
 my scarf off my he
ad, and th ey gave 
me a bottle with medicine, and they send me 
out in the front room, and turn on the light, 
and the Russians, as drunk as they were, they
 start running, because 
they know there was 
typhus in that -- I was over already, but s
till looked like a musselw
oman, you know, sick 
with the salve on my  head. They  start runni
ng. And this is how I saved six wo men from 
being raped by the Russians. Then my hair 
start growing in a little
 bit, and I was going 
down the stairs, and there was a little pond ne
ar that apartment, and there wasn™t that 
mu ch water, and anything, and I thought I™ll 
wash out my -- whatev
er I have, in that 
pond. And all of a sudden I looked up, and there were two big, black boots in front of me, 

and I looked up, and he said to me, in Russi
an -- at that time I 
was still speaking Russian. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053

He said, ﬁAteeja dofka.ﬂ I mean, am -- am I Je
wish. And I said yes. He said, ﬁI am too, 
from Odessa, don™t get scared.ﬂ 
So I took him up in
to the apartment wh
ere the girls were. 
They saw us [indecipherable] th
ey got so scared, th
ey said, ﬁAre you out of your mind?ﬂ 
You know, they dragged me back in the othe
r room. And it so happened that it -- he was 
there for two weeks. He fall in love with me, 
he wanted to marry me
. He gave me even a 
wedding band. And I wasn™t even  15 years old 
yet. But nobody knew that. And he says to 
me he is going on the front, and he is going to 
write to his father, an d his father will la -- 
his father is a doctor in the army, a big offi
cer, and arrange to pick me up. And I thought 
to myself, ﬁLet him talk.ﬂ Bu
t -- but the mo -- wonderful th
ing was about it, for all two 
weeks he slept in the front room of our apar
tment, so nobody coul
d get in. And when  he 
left, we went to work in a ho
spital, to help the Russian sold
iers. So we slept there, so 
nobody could touch us there either. And 
one day a man came up to me, and he said, 
ﬁAkeem Marouskas Su pporzhnikova?ﬂ Am I Ma
rsha Supporzhniko -- Marouska -- ma -- 
Marioshka Supporzhnikov. And I said yes. 
ﬁMy son wrote a letter at home that you are 

here in Lomborg, an d I was looking fo r you, 
and here I find you in th e hospital. I would 
like to send you to Odessa. He 
wants to marry you.ﬂ And I told
 him, I said, ﬁI cannot do 
it. I have to go back home first. I h ave to se
e where my -- if I have any family left, I have 
anything,ﬂ I said. He said, ﬁDo you love my
 son?ﬂ I said, ﬁI don™t know him well enough. 
I don™t know what love is.ﬂ I s -- I -- he di
dn™t know my age, he didn™t know nothing. 
Nobody know nothing about anybod
y. And, you know, I was s
till scared to 
tell my age, 
because my two little sisters we
re killed because they were 
under 15. And I -- so even 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053
  
 
 
 
6
after I was liberated, I was afraid
 to tell my age. So, even to
 that man that was the fa -- 
and I asked him, I said -- this may not be in
terested on the tape, but I asked him, I said, 
ﬁTell me, why are you, a officer in a differe
nt battalion, from a different town than your 
son is, and you™re not even Je
wish?ﬂ Everybody says Marshall Zou, or whatever his name  
was, I don™t even reme mb er, and he says, ﬁYou 
see, they  took us, the Jewish officers, and 
docto rs, and send us to different
 places, because when we were caught from the Germans, 
that the soldiers, the Ru
ssian soldiers shouldn™t give us ou
t that we are Jews on top of it.ﬂ 
So this is my first lesson I learned, that I wa
sn™t the only one that suffered, and th ere were 

other people as young as I was,
 at -- it concentrated, that an
swer concentrated into my 
mind. And we felt better, and we didn™t kn
ow there was [indecipherable] existed. We 
didn™t know about people not 
going back home or nothing. A
ll I want is to go home, and 
see what™s happened. 

Q: Would you let me ask you 
ju st one quick  question. Did 
you know anything about your 
family me mb ers at that point? Are -- you know 
your sist -- your two sisters -- you said 
your two sisters were -- 

A: My two little sister, my
 mother, was taken away in Stutt
hof. I didn™t know if they are -
- were dead, or alive, or nothing. I had a fee
ling that they were killed there. All taken to 
Theresienstadt. Now that I read the books 
about it, ther -- and then from there to 
Auschwitz. I don™t know what 
happened to them. I can only
 tell you I lost them, about 
maybe a week after we were in Stutthof. But 
the only thing that bothered me is that they 
were taken out of the uniforms
, the striped uniforms, and give
n civilian clothes when they 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053
  
 
 
 
7
were taken away. And when I want
ed to go with them
, they left a big dog on me, this is 
all in my other tape. And all I wanted to 
go and see if anybody was left. I was -- my  
father was in Dachau . I know my  grandfathers
 were taken away in  the beginning, and -- 
and this -- I knew they were 
dead. My other family -- certa
in family members w ere all 
dead, because I know they were
 taken on the ninefort and k
illed in Kovno, of the Kovno 
ghetto. And anybody did nothing -- not many 
people escaped from the ninefort. But the 
thing is is, is -- what I want to tell you is 
that I wanted to go home. So they  said yes, 
they™ll s -- they™ll s -- put us on trains, and 
they ™ll send us home. So
 th ey put us on big 
trucks, and they took us to a place, a good 
-- I don™t know how to say it in English, a 

ranch, a big ranch in -- in Palmerton, it was near Nimitz, near -- not far from Stetlin, not 

far from Lomborg, Rigenwald, Lomborg, an d 
so on. And they took us there, and there 
were some Russian girls, wh
ite Russian girls, they were
 playing the piano. And the 
Jewish girls, the one that went with the Germ
ans -- and the Jewish girls, they put us to 
clean up stalls, and they put us to
 -- to -- to -- to -- 
to the dirtiest work 
in the world. They 
didn™t give us enough fo od, the Russians. Th
ey didn™t kill us, they didn™t beat us, but 
there was a -- they -- we -- we -- we were alwa
ys watched, we were always watched with 
guard s, like in the [indecipherable]. The only 
difference was that we weren™t beaten up, 
we weren™t treated as dirty Jews, but we we
re treated different. There were about maybe 
10 Jewish girls. And one day the captain aske
d me if I -- asked anybody if they would 
like to go to learn with ve
terinarian. There is a doctor in Rigenwald that will teach 

veterinarian, because what they
 were doing is taking 
the cows and the horses of the fields 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053

that were running wild. And th ey opened a 
conzerr factory, and they open a cheese 
factory. And what they did is, they needed 
the cows to be healt
hy, to see if they™re 
healthy, they  take -- to take analysis fro
m horses -- I found th at out later, when I came 
back. I said, ﬁI™m going.ﬂ Like in German 
concentration camp, in those little camps, if 
th ey  n e ed ed  so mebo dy  to
 go to threshing, f -- harvesting 
or something, people were sent 
to s -- Auschwitz. I didn™t care any more wh en they took away my
 mother, my two little 
sister s, and the rest of my fam
ily. So I was the first one, I -- he 
sa -- I said, ﬁI am going to 
Rigenwald.ﬂ We came to Rigenwald, the doctor 
that they sent to teach us, it must have 
been from different camps around that, but fro
m our camp  we went only one Russian girl, 
and two Jewish girls. And wh at happened is is 
that -- w h at™s so amazing is that the doctor 
was a drunk. He was comp l -- always drunk. 
And we learned some. We learned how to 
protect when a cow is slaughtered, to recogn
ize if it has tuberculosis around th e lungs. 
We learned how to take analysis from a horse ™s neck. We learned ho -- if they got this 
eye sickness, the horses, to get rid of them. 
We learned the cows, th
ey had a certain thing 
on their skin, to put them -- wh
at is the end of a -- of a 
match called? It™s a certain 
chemical. P u t them in a tent, and put theminto the chemical. So get away the sickness 

shouldn™t spread. We learned certain things 
in -- in about three 
weeks, but the most 
important thing for me was that I made friends
 with the put -- Polkol
vnik™s wife, with the 
main man™s wife. I mu st have had in me pa-par
t of it of my father, like I said before. She 
went in a nightgown  to the opera, and [indeci
pherable] others. I -- I 
told her that™s not 
proper. I told her your hair doesn ™t look, let me 
comb  it for you. We got to be the best of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053
  
 
 
 
9
friends, I and the Pot -- Polkolvnik™s wife. A
nd th ey treated me like a daughter the two 
weeks I was -- three w eeks we were there. 
After three weeks we got a paper with  a 
pitshot, you know, with the stam
p, like the Russians always do.
 Akivia trinarn inyarz. I 
was a veterinarian nurse, believe it or not. We
 came into that village
 again, we worked. 
We worked with the horses, 
we worked this. Two weeks la
ter, after we came back from 
Rigenwald, they put -- Po
lk ovnik and his wife arrived in th
at good -- in that trench. There 
was a very, very ugly captain that run it, 
and he hated Jews, very
 anti-Semitic. And he 
said, ﬁAkdere Marouska?ﬂ Where is marsh -- 
Marouska. And the captain said, ﬁIn her 
room with the other Jewish girl.ﬂ He says, 
ﬁIn her room? You mean to tell me  she doesn™t 
have an ap artment of her own?ﬂ And his wife 
got very mad. He said, ﬁI want to call her 
immediately for dinner, to have dinner with
 us.ﬂ Because there was dinner in the 
captain™s house. It™s a bi -- in
 the good -- you know, in  the ranch, the big ranch house. So 
when  he called me in, I had dinner with them
, and he gave a order to  the captain that I 
have to have my  own apartment, that I have to
 be in ch arge of the cheese factory. I have 
to be sent to a different village. But in a couple of weeks, till they have everything 
prepared, and -- now, don™t forg et
, in July atel -- I was libera
ted in March, and July atel 
15. And what happened is is before I left fo
r the other -- good for the other ranch, big 
ranch, the Jewish girls were playing a pian
o, and th e Russian girls were cleaning the 
stalls. But what they did is, 
I was there to be heavily guard
ed, because they would have 
killed me, the Russian girls. So 
what happened is is when I we
nt to that good, I arrived, 
and I was all of a sudden I was in charge of 
a milk factory -- cheese factory, and at night 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053
  
 
 
 
10
the Russian soldiers from all around, from the 
good th at I worked  in, the ranch, from all 
the ranches they would come, and -- and Po lis
h soldiers they woul
d come, and I would 
give them all cheeses and milk, cause the Russ
ian soldiers weren™t fe
d either. They would 
cut around the tuberculosis, around the cows, 
and then  they would make like a soup with  
potatoes, and ev ery -- that all they had to eat
 all day. Everything was shipped to  Ru ssia. 
And what happened is is that they liked me
 very much the Russi an soldiers, and the 
Polish soldiers came, and ther
e came some fliers from St
ettlin, and they would bring 
liquor and so  on. Bu t one thing would happ
en, when  they woul
d get too drunk, the 
woman th at owned th at ranch was a very, very
 wealthy woman. That™s
 the first time I ate 
waffles in my  life, because she had the st
ove that she moved waffles around. She was 
from Pullman. She was German, 
from Pullman, and she was lik
e a mother to me. So the 
minute she saw that they got drunk, she lock
 me upstairs in one 
of the quarters, and 
nobody could get near me. But I did a lot of 
things in that camp that a child of my age 
wouldn™t do. I was boar hunting, believe it 
or not. I was boar hunting with the Russians, 
with the Polish officers. I -- I did everything 
I wanted. I run that village. And I was ride 
out, with  the guard of course, 
I would ride out to the fields, and check up on the pomeron 
women, and see the German women, and see how
 they milked the cows
, if they are clean 
in the fields and so on. 
Q: How did you know how to manage that? 
A: I don™t know. It just came natural to me. It
 just came n atural to 
me. In the beginning I 
was very ver -- I said I was going to take
 revenge. In th e beginning I was riding my  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053
  
 
 
 
11
horse, I would see children on th e street, I di
dn™t care, I was ride -- dust, the dirt and 
everything. But then  about a 
mo nth later, I was taking them medicine, and food, I was 
stealing from the Russians, and givi
ng to the poor German kids. 
Q: So -- 
A: This is a Jewish heart. We
™re a very comp assionate people. 
Q: So when you got some comp assion again, 
and could build yourself up, then you were 
able to -- 

A: Not very long -- didn™t take me very long to
 build up, to feel sorry for those kids, and 
take them food, and take them me dicine, 
and steal from the Ru ssians. And one day the 
captain came to me, and that -- th
is is a really funny story. He
 came to me to my village. 
And he says, you know there was a befell -- wa
s like when there™s a 
order that the -- the 
Russians can take nothing away animal from 
the Germans. Absolute
ly nothing, no co ws, 
no horses, nothing. And th e eye sickness of th
e horses, I forgot how it was called. I was 
never a veterinarian, so I forgot it. Broke out
 and we lost seven horses, and they  put -- 
Polkovnik was coming, and he sa
id, ﬁYour village is full of horses.ﬂ He™s talking to a 
grown up person, you know. ﬁI
 need seven horses.ﬂ I said
, ﬁFine, I™ll give you seven 
horses. You release seven see -- seven girls 
from the -- that you™re holding. If you put 
them on the train, I™ll give you seven.ﬂ Said, 
ﬁI can™t do that many, but I™ll release some.ﬂ 
I said, ﬁOkay.ﬂ So how do I do 
it? I have to have a plan. So I sat down, and I talked to the 
German woman that took care of me, and I ma
de my self a plan. I am -- I got a lot of 

fantastic liq uor from those majors that came
, from the -- the pilo
ts from Stettlin. And I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053
  
 
 
 
12
invited seven officers from the Polish camp. An
d we got them so drunk that they  were 
flat on the floor. We took off their uniforms,
 there were waiting seven Russian soldiers. 
We put the Polish uniform on th
e Russian soldier, and the Ru
ssian soldiers, they went 
out, they  got the seven horses , came back, got them dressed back their unifo rm, dropped 

them on a cart, and took them back to thei
r camp. The next thing the rumor was in the 
village that the Polish army stole seven hor
ses. Now I had someth
ing over that captain. 
He was so afraid of me that you have no id
ea. Because God forbid 
he should go to the 
higher ups, and ev erything. So  everything I wa
nted, I got. So when 
the soldiers from each 
camp, when I rode with them, 
wanted to come and eat at my camp, they came and eat. If 
they wanted to -- whatev
er they wanted to -- the Jewish 
girls lived the life of Riley, and 
he was afraid of me as hell. One day I wa
s riding with a man from Georgia, I™ll never 
forget, and a short Jewish man came up to me, 
and in Jewish says to me, ﬁAre y -- do you 
know anybody by th e name of Myashka Suppor
zhnikov?ﬂ And I said to him like that. I 

put my  hand to my  thro at, my  mouth, and 
I said, ﬁOh please don™t say anything.ﬂ And th e 
Russian soldier understo
od what he said, or he had a feeling. He said, ﬁMarouska, don™t 
worry. Anything you want I™ll do for you,
 because you saved my  life, you got some 
medicine when I was sick. You brought food fo
r me. I will help you with anything I can.ﬂ 
A very, very lo -- I couldn™t say low [indeci
pherable] because he 
was intelligent, with 
intelligent you have to be born. Very av
erage person, you kno
w? And I couldn™t 
understand why he does it.
 And he said, you know wh at? So I tell him the story, that I 
found out from that man that my 
father is alive in Lódz, in 
Poland, and he came to pick 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053
  
 
 
 
13
me up. So he said to me, ﬁNot only will I ta
ke you -- let you go, but I™ll take you to the 
train.ﬂ And I want to tell you something. Wh
en we came into the villages, the houses 
were empty, but there was so mu ch clothes,
 and jewelry, and cameras. With everything 
was in my  apartment, when  I was riding on th
at horse, I didn™t even have a sweater on. 
I™ll never forget, I had the silk, maroon bl
ouse on. I rememb er now, I didn™t rememb er 
before, riding boots, and -- and 
they™re real good boots, beca
use one of the officer, police 
officer, brought it to me, and riding pants. Th
at™s all I had with me, because I was going 
with him to check out the fiel
ds, how th e milk is going, how everything is going. And I 
said, ﬁOkay. You are taking me to the train, 
but I™m going to give you a letter. And wh en 
the captain does something to 
you, you tell him, ‚I have a letter from Maroushka about 

the seven horses.™ ﬂ I said, ﬁAt least I can do 
for you th at you don™
t get punish ed, or put 
in jail, or anything like that.ﬂ So what I did 
is I -- I still wrote Russian at that time, I sat 
down, and in no time I wrote him a letter. He to
ok us to th e train. And th at man says to 
me, ﬁNow remember, I am Polish, I speak ve
ry  good Polish, your father send me, and I 
want you to be like you™re -- you don™t know
 how to speak, you 
don™t know how to -- 
you™re -- you™re dumb. Whatev
er anybody says, you just move your head.ﬂ Because at 
that time, the Polish Akar, the 
Polish fascists were killing th
e Jews like crazy, especially 
on trains, and so  on. And I listened to him, a
nd he might -- I don™t even [indecipherable] I 
was freezing a little bit. And I went to -- we we
nt with the train and we arrived in Lódz. 
Q: When  ab out -- when  abouts was that [inaudible] time? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053
  
 
 
 
14
A: That was still in 1945, the 
end of 1945. I think it was the e
nd of 1940 -- yes, the end of 
1945. And I arrived in Lódz, an
d that™s in Poland, and I met 
my father, and I met a lot of 
people from my town that were left ali -- not
 a lot, because you kn
ow, people that were 
left over, and of course, my father couldn™t 
tell me something that I couldn™t do. I was 
smoking, and he said, ﬁYou can™t smoke.ﬂ A
nd I said, ﬁWhat do yo
u mean to tell me I 
can™t smoke? I can smoke, I can do
 whatever I want to.ﬂ If I thought to myself, maybe at 
that time -- I don™t know if I 
thought to myself this way, 
if I can handle a Po-Polkovnik 
[indecipherable] I can handle 
my  father, you know. If he tells me not to smoke, it™s none 
of his business if I smoke or I don™t smoke. And 
at that time my fath er was a tailor, a very 
good tailor. That what saved our life also 
in the Kovno ghetto. And he start work. He 
worked in -- in Lódz as a 
tailor, and he help ed a lot 
of people from Lithuania, from 
Kovno th at went thro ugh Lódz. He had a 
big apartment, and in -- the one -- that 
apartment, downstairs was a 
big room. I don™t -- it was like
 a hole. And anybody th at 
went thro ugh, went through my
 fa -- they said, ﬁGo to  Beryl Supporzhnikov.ﬂ And they  
went thro ugh, and ev erybody knew him, be
cause he was a very good lo oking man from 
Kovno, very well dressed, and always the 
best. And th-they came, and he wo uld give 
them food, and he wo uldn™t let them go back  to
 Lithuania, because he found out that it™s 
not good there. You know, I fo
und out later on that I have an older sister in Lithuania. 

This is how he found out that I am in th
at camp, from her. Some
how she found
 out from 
somebody that I am alive in that camp. Ma
ybe somebody that escaped. And she let my 
father know it. People smuggled in things. 
So he know what was going on. The people

15
are trying to go out of Lithuani
a. So anybody that went throug
h that wanted to go back to  
Kovno, to Lithuania, he woul
dn™t let them. He kept them 
there, he kept them till the 
kibbutz took them, and took 
them over to Bratislava, a
nd then to displaced camps. 
Because at that time L ódz wasn™t 
yet Communistic as much, and -- 
Q: Actually, maybe we should -- 
A: Can we stop -- 
Q: -- take a little break  -- 

A: -- at the end there? 
Q: -- because this is the -- yeah, let 
me just -- I made 
my [indecipherable] 
A: I have to  go to the bathroom. 
Q: Yeah. This is the end of tape one, 
side A, interview with Marsha Loen. 
End of Tape One, Side A 
Beginning Tape On e, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of the United St
ates Holocaust Memori
al Museum interview 
with Marsha Loen. This is tape number
 one, side B. So 
you were in Lódz. 
A: So I arrived in Lódz, and my father, and 
ev erybody, we were partying, and of course I 
was smoking, like I said, and my father said, 
ﬁYou can™t smoke,ﬂ and I said, ﬁYes I can.ﬂ 
And anyway , he did not have a big control over
 me, that I have to say. And it was very 
sad. And for one reason my father didn™t have
 a big control over me , and I hate to say it, 
my father was a very selfish man, and I re
memb ered him from ghetto, what he did to us. 
And I really -- I loved my  father, but I didn™t lik
e him. I™m sorry to say this, should rest in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053
  
 
 
 
16
peace. And what happened is is that in Lódz
 he says to me -- he -- he knew that my 
mo ther is dead, and he got himself a girlfriend,
 a friend of my mothers, that sh e lost her 
husband and two kids, also in the Kovno ghetto.
 And what happened is 
is that he says to 
me, ﬁI have enough money to smuggle th
e border.ﬂ Now he-her
e he helps all the 
strangers, and his only leftove
r child, he says, ﬁI have 
enough money to smuggle the 
border for me and Rocholla. I don™t have en
ough money for you.ﬂ 
So what do I do? I 
went into the kibbutz, in -- 
to work in the hospital b
ecause I know how to give a 
injection, you know, I learned a little bit th
ere at the Russian camp,
 by wo rking with the 
animals, it™s not that different to give a inje
ction, and take a temp erature, and so on. So  I 
went into  the kibbutz, and I stay
ed in the kibbutz, and I learned how to -- in Lódz -- and I 
worked in the hospital, and in
 Madrid the head of the kib
butz came to me, and he says, 
ﬁMarsha,ﬂ -- now, nobody knew my  age. I --
 I looked so mu ch older than I am, thanks 
God, that why I was alive -- I don™t know if 
it™s thanks God or not. And he says to me, 
ﬁYou know what,ﬂ he says, ﬁy
ou want to go -- get over on th
e other side?ﬂ I says, ﬁYes, I 
want to get away from Lódz,ﬂ because I was 
engaged to  a man that 
was 34 years old, and 
I was not -- I was 15. He gave a diamond watch 
to a friend of my fath
ers, to introduce us. 
And he was so jealous when  I went away on 
business or something in Lódz, and wh en he 
came back and I wasn™t home, he was running all over, looking fo r me. And I had already 
my wedding dress, because he impressed me
 so tremendously . You 
know, coming out of 
the concen tration camps, coming out of that 
place, that Russian camp , and everything, 
and he brought me presents, 
and -- and he took me to pl
aces, but I could not speak 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053
  
 
 
 
17
Jewish, and I could not speak 
any other language with him.
 So he said, ﬁI will do the 
speaking, you keep quiet, Marous
ka.ﬂ And that -- that was it. 
So he impressed me with all 
the diamonds, and all the sweaters, and -- 
and he was a very, very rich man.  
Q: What nationality was he again? 

A: He was a Jewish -- a Polish Jew. 
Q: And what language did he
 want to speak with you? 
A: He want to spea -- he couldn™t speak, beca
use the Akar are killing people in Lódz, in 
the bus stops, everywhere you went. Not ma
ny people could go to
 a movie in 1940s -- 

end of 1945, beginning of 1946
. They couldn™t go to a movi
e. They couldn™t walk the 
streets and speak Yiddish. Absolutely not, Jewi
sh. So what happened is is he impressed 
me with all those things, and I was going to  ma
rry him. Then -- and then I realized it, oh 
my gosh, I can™t marry that man, that man is --
 could -- is older -- practically as old as my  
father, he is jealous, I don™t have no friends
, I can™t make any friends. Now this is me 
thinking, a youngster, a teenager. And I said, 
ﬁI have to get away from him.ﬂ So on our 
engagement party at this cousin
™s estate in Lódz, I dance w
ith his best friend, a Jew from 
the Polish army , and I came back to the couch, 
and he doesn™t want to talk to me. So I 
said to the friend, ﬁChaim, give me my cape
.ﬂ And I took my cape, and I went to my 
father™s house. And I said, ﬁWould you like 
to go to Bratislav right now,ﬂ the next 
mo rning? And he was running af
ter me, and he was yelling, and stop, and he came to the 
door, and that friend of his left, and I locked 
the door. He said, ﬁYes
.ﬂ I said, ﬁPack.ﬂ And 
I run over -- from the other side, I run over to 
the kibbutz, and I told that man, I™m taking 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053
  
 
 
 
18
-- that was the next day that that was -- he wa
nted me to take the transport. Everything -- 
you see, we were trained to take the transport 
over the border, people th
at wanted to do it. 
And that what -- why I went into the kibbutz. He 
said to me -- I said  to him, ﬁI™ll take that 
transport. But my father and 
my stepmother go,ﬂ 
-- I -- I mi -- I called her my stepmother, 
she wasn™t yet -- ﬁgoes with me.ﬂ He says, 
ﬁOkay, it™s arranged.ﬂ Because it so happened  
that the people that were 
supposed to take me -- it, 
the co uple don™t feel so hot. 
Q: The idea was to go to  Palestine eventually? 

A: Yeah. The ide -- I don™t know. We had to  ge
t out of Lódz. Oh , yes, the idea to go to 
Palestine was from the beginning. To go to  Pales
tine, th at was my ideal thing. So here we 
are, we™re ready, and everybody, I™m taking 25
 people over the border to Bratislav. From 
Lódz to Bratislav, the Akar 
shooting after us. Now, I want to tell you, my stepmother 
Rocholla, was with me in the 
same camp, and I helped her st
ay behind, because she froze 
her feet up. My feet were frozen, too. They 
took off her fingers from one foot, in Lódz, 
and she couldn™t walk that fast. They wanted to  take some of my toes off, and I wouldn™t 

let them, because the doctor sa
id there™s a chance th
at they can heal that. So I went for 
therapy, and wh at I did is, I washed floors,
 I did everything to pay th e doctor. And the 
docto r gave me therapy, hot and cold baths, 
and salves, and everything, and it starts -- it 
looked like I had a fungus on 
my foot, but it start healin g.
 And I could walk. And th en 
when  I went into the kibbutz, the kibbutz pa
id part of it. So, in about two and a half 
months, my feet were ready to go. And I had 
those -- they got me orthoped ic shoes at the 

kibbutz, and I went. And as we were going, 
what I wanted to tell you, I run aw ay from 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053
  
 
 
 
19
that guy -- later on I heard he had a nervous 
breakdown, I don™t know about that one. Bu t 
I want to tell you th e Akar, you couldn™t go to  a 
movie, you couldn™t go to a restaurant if 
you were Jewish, if you spoke Jewish. They
 a -- every day they 
had something happen 
Jew in Lódz. One was shot in a -- in a bus st
op, the other one was deesent, it was terrible. 
For me, it was a terrib le thing, because as ba
d as the Russian was, they never beat us, 
they  never hurt us, they never shot us. So I 
went and I took th at transport. And the Akar 
was shooting after us. It was in the middle of
 the night. And I -- ed -- everybody slowed  
down , and th ey were mad at me because of my
 stepmother. It didn™t take long we arrived 
in Bratislav. Arrived in Bratislav, my father
 never said thank you 
to me for taking him, 
and ev erything else, but they put us on trains 
to go to Germany, an
d to go -- and it so 
happened that we went through
 Austria with the train. And 
they said, ﬁWho would like to 
stay in Austria?ﬂ And I saw those beautiful 
mountains, and that b
eautiful scenery, and 
like I told you, at the Ru ssian camp I was boar hunting, and I was riding, and I loved 
sports. Even  as a child, when I was eight 
years old, I was at the school Olympics, you 
know. So what happened
 is is that I was a d aredevil. 
I was a -- lik e I™m a tomboy when I 
was a youngster. Because there was a certain 
branch out from my we
r -- my grandfather 
from my mother™s side was a ve
ry well-to-do man, and I was hi
s angel. It™s supposed to 
be a boy, but still he called me by a boyish na
me, Yankela. But I was his life. So what I 
mean is that I -- I -- from th
e beginning, you know, I wasn™t in public school, I was 
thrown out when  I was seven years old. I 
hit a teacher, accident
ally, you know. Not 
accidentally, sh -- a man was putting ink in the 
back of my head, a bo
y. And I told her, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053
  
 
 
 
20
and she said -- and she didn™t like it, because
 she knows I come fro
m a better family. So 
she, ﬁYou keep quiet. You sit down.ﬂ And it 
happened  four times, I couldn™t stand it any 
mo re. And you know th e way th ey  sit in 
Europe, you™re a German, you know. The 
teacher sits in front before 
you go out the door. So I took my
 thing that I was writing in, 
my  book -- my  pad -- my  noteb ook, and I took it and I hit it at her, and I said, ﬁI am 
leaving.ﬂ And accidentally I hit her nose. Anyw
ay, that™s a long story, I™m not going to 
get into it. I was thrown  out of the school, and my  gran dfather had to  pay a lot of money. 
He would have loved me to go to
 Hebrew school, but they -- th
ey wouldn™t take me in, so 
I went to komairts gimnasia, 
it was a Jewish priv ate school. So  I™m telling you, I was a 
daredevil from the beginning. So as we come 
to that beautiful country Austria, I said, 
ﬁPapa, if you and Rocholla want to go on 
to Germany, go ahead.
 I™m staying in this 
country in. Because they
 told us they are taking us to 
places where they
 put us up, and 
from there we™ll be able to go to Palestine, an d so on. 

Q: Who were -- who were they? I just wondered. 

A: That was also the Bricha. But at that
 time I didn™t know who they were. You 
understand what I mean? So I sat on the train, 
they stopped the train, we went off, and we 
went toward this place called Verkshide [indeci
pherable]. It was a h o rrible place. It was 
wooden barracks. The fo
od was also rationed, but it was 
good. We were DDT™s, and so 
on. So ag ain, I said, why sh ould I take that
. So I made friends with the American essing 
officer that distribute the food, 
and he had the -- the trucks a
nd so  on. I made friends with 
Dr. Dimetritus, because I helped him in -- th
at he was a Greek -- not Jewish, Greek that

21
run the -- the -- the hospital in the displacedcamp, and also the head of the displaced 
camp. So -- and I also work ed fo r the -- fo r the Itterdude. That™s organization from -- 
from the first president of -- of Palestine, 
and -- in the young brigade, goldonia. And I -- 
in the displaced camp, in Verk shide, I made friends with them, so oh -- and I was getting 

looking very  good. I was a pretty good looking girl. 
Q: Still are. 
A: And I had very good friends, and I -- that 
essing officer, and everybody, th ey were just 
doing ev erything when  I ask, and so on. And th
ere were a lot of ma -- people sent to the 
displaced camp from Israel, they were called Sh
eliaks, to talk to the people how to get 
over to Palestine, and at that time. And I me
t with them, and I went out with them one 
night to a night club, that a friend of mine™s
 mo ther owned it, Alon
stra, it™s in Linz, in 
Austria. And I get a call from the pharmacist, 
from the -- from the displaced camp. He 
says, ﬁMarsha, we are going to DDT the camp.
ﬂ Verkshide. He said
, ﬁWould you like to 
have some fun?ﬂ This is how I met my  husband,
 I want to tell you this sto -- that™s why 
I™m telling you this story. I said, ﬁI love to, 
as long as you don™t touch my barrack, or my 
father™s.ﬂ S aid fine. So I came, and they put me
 in in a white, big, lo
ng thing with a mask. 
And I am going around, and I am spraying th
e barracks, and being very gentle about it, 
because it™s my people, and everything, and a
ll of a sudden I open a room, and the people 
are sitting, they are all dressed beautiful
, drinking wine, havi
ng beau tiful food and 
everything. And I got so mad that I pulled my
 mask down, and I start spraying the DDT 
at them. And one of them was my  husband, Co
rnelius. And at that time he saw my eyes, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053
  
 
 
 
22
he saw my face, and he said he fall in love
 with me. He was em 
-- then they liquidated 
Verkshid e, and they  send us to a mu ch be
tter displaced camp called Bindermichl. And 
that was -- Goering™s built some
 apartment houses. So they 
put two, three families into 
rooms, a family into a room, and with my fath
er -- I live with my fa
ther, I got mad at my 
father, I walked out on him. I went to live w ith a girlfriend, it so 
happened in the same 
place my husband had a room with
 another man, and my husba
nd worked for 
the Joint at 
that time. Joint Distribution 
Committee. And I met him, and 
what happened is I worked 
for the bri -- for the Itterd
ude, and I start getting in
to the Bricha business. 
Q: What did you do, wh en you say you wo
rked for them, what 
did you do exactly? 
A: I -- I wrote for them, I tran slated for them in Russian, in
 Yiddish , in whatever it is. I 
work ed on the Jewish typewriter, and -- you k
now, in -- in the same
 time when we moved 
to Bindermichl, I said, ﬁI™m 
going to go to school.ﬂ To go 
to school -- I spoke a little bit 
of German, and to go to school 
you had to be a certain age, but
 I wanted to -- I want to go 
into art school. Just go all over, all those thin
gs we™re speaking, German, nothing, fo r me 
that doesn™t exist. I want to go
 to art school. To go to art sc
hool I had to take a course in 
German, and I went into  art school, and also 
work ed fo r the Itterdude at the same time. 
And one day they said to me
, ﬁMarsha, we are going to take some people over.ﬂ And 
what happened is voke -- going to -- to school 
in Austria, I got this Au strian outfit, with 
my  big, black braid, with the Austrian ha
ir, you know, with the feather. And I spoke 
already the dialect in Austria pretty good. So
 they said, ﬁWe need 
you.ﬂ I said, ﬁWhy do 
you need me?ﬂ They came to 
the office of the Itterdude. They  said, ﬁWe need -- we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053
  
 
 
 
23
smuggle people, we™re going to  be straight 
with you. We smuggle people thro ugh th e 
Innsbruck border,ﬂ they say, ﬁinto the Italian,
 into the middle of th
e mountain, and there 
the Italian take over.ﬂ I said, ﬁI™m ready, 
I™m going.ﬂ So I -- and it was vacation time, and 
I come in, and they tell me what to do, and I 
do it. And wh at happen
ed also is that the 
first thing that I went into th
e Austrian school to learn art, 
I had a friend of mine do me a 
false passp ort. A Austrian false passport, 
what nobody had. So I can do things that 
nobody else can. The 
a -- the essing officer moved with
 us to Bindermichl. And you 
know to have, I mean, a friendship with th at
 -- with the -- you must heard about it -- I 
know you™re younger than I am, to have a fri
endship with a -- with an American soldier, 
you were like a whore, excuse my expression
. But that man was so beautiful. And I said, 
ﬁYou know, I need a truck.ﬂ He 
said, ﬁWhy do you need a truc
k?ﬂ I said, ﬁOh, we want to 
go to  Ebensee skiing,ﬂ we want to go th ere, we
 want to go there. He said, ﬁOkay, what 
else do you need?ﬂ I said that
 I need some food provision 
a little bit and so on. Says, 
ﬁOkay, we going out next week?ﬂ I said, ﬁFine,
 it™s alrig h t with me.ﬂ So he gave me the 
truck, and we took the people to Zanenfeld. 
That™s near Innsbruck, and there was nothing, 
there was just some hou -- fenced  in, like I reme
mb er a fenced in place. I had the picture 
of it, a trumpet. I don™t know wh ere I put it,
 it disappeared . And we would call in, and we 
would -- we took a little package, each one to
ok a little packag e with them. We went 
through that little -- w h at do you call it? 
Q: Little pass? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053
  
 
 
 
24
A: Little pat into the mountain. We took th em
 up the mountain, we went one by one. And 
then we would leave them there, the Italia
ns would take over, and 
the two people that 
took them would co me back to the camp , and come to Zanenfeld. 
Q: How dangerous was that? 

A: Very dangerous, because fi
rst place, I was on a false passport. Second place, I am 
caughting smuggling people over the border. 
Now that was over the Italian border, you 
understand what I mean? They 
didn™t know what I was smugg
ling there. I could say I™m 
smuggling to it -- Italy, you know. And -- but
 it was dangerous, it was [indecipherable].  
And then  one time was shooting off [indecipher
able] it was dangerous. My  father didn™t 

want me to do it, and I said, ﬁYou can™t tell me
 what to do, I do what I want to do.ﬂ And I 
already met my  husband. 

Q: How about Corn elius? Did he
 want to -- you to do it? 
A: That -- I -- he wasn™t that time with me th
at -- that clo se, we just knew each other. He 
invited me to go to a concert, and I want
ed to go dancin g, and I was invited from the 
American head of the camp to go dancin
g in th e club, in th e camp  club. And I 
[indecipherable] said, ﬁThat man is crazy. I 
should go to a concert when I can™t go 
dancing?ﬂ He said, ﬁA little culture won™t help
 you -- won™t hurt you.ﬂ But I didn™t go 
with him, but every other day 
he was waiting near the office
, the Itterdude for me. And I 
finally start going out with him. In the beginn
ing I was mad, it™s a long story, because I 
thought he went out with 
somebody else, and so on. 
Q: What did you like about -- 
what did you like about him?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053
  
 
 
 
25
A: What I liked about him, you see, I never 
went out with anybody th at didn™t have a 
education. I never went out with  anybody that
 had dirty nails, or du
sty shoes. Never. That 
was my  -- I don™t know why, don™t ask me. I 
don™t know -- I don™t understand it. And I 
liked him, I wasn™t in love 
with him yet, but I liked him. And I -- and he brought me 
beautiful things he bought from the Joint, 
and there was a lot of beautiful clothes, you 
know. And I didn™t really need
 it, because I went out with a guy -- now this is I wa -- I 
was already 16. I went out with a guy that 
was from the Prague University, and he was 
the head of the police 
in the camp, and lived out of th
e -- outside of the camp. And he 
thought I was going to 
marry him. And that -- one day he 
got very sick. I had a fi -- I fou 
-- another thing is, it™s very interesting, this 
is old camp , and th is is old displaced camp . I 
made friends with the CIC from England, a wo
man, and she was very in love with that 
guy Tommy , that man that I am telling you ab out. And sh e went home one day and she 
brought me a poodle, and fo r herself a big bo
xer. And the boxer in the compartment, in 
the plane, bit a piece of the poodle™s foot. So
 Dr. Dimitri, the doctor, fixed the f -- the -- 
the -- the poodle™s foot. And I left him with
 Tommy, of course in Tommy™s house, and I 
called him Tommy , because Tommy had some 
stomach trouble. He was a Jew from the 
Univ ersity of Prague, and I called him Tommy . 
So  I left him, and one day, one evening I 
went home, and I came home the next mo rning, and I want to go into  his apartment, and 
his valet doesn™t let me in. And I said, ﬁWhy, 
what™s going on? I have to go in, I forgot 
something.ﬂ Anyway, I had a lit --
 bitty little fight with him, I 
went into the room, and my 
girls from the redhaired was sti -- the two d
ogs were lying next to the bed, and my  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053
  
 
 
 
26
girlfriend™s from the CIC, re -- the redhead was 
sticking out of the bed.
 He starts running 
after me, and -- and begging me, and ev erything, 
and I said, ﬁNo, no, no, no, I don™t want 
anything to do with you.ﬂ A
nyway, I come to my father. 
He said, ﬁDo you sleep with 
him?ﬂ My father was very outspoken with me
. I said, ﬁNo.ﬂ He sa
id, ﬁYou know, a man 
needs it, and they need to get 
it somewhere. So he has your gi
rlfriend handy, so he did it. 
I don™t like Tommy , I don™t want him to go out 
with you.ﬂ I said, ﬁYou have nothing to  
say, Papa.ﬂ I said, ﬁI do what I want, but I do
n™t want to go back  with him, I don™t want 
anything to do with him.ﬂ So one day I was ou
t with the shleeoch da
ncing, and I get again 
a call. Tommy is very sick, he won™t take
 any medicine, nothing. This was already 
Bindermichl. He won™t take any medicine, nothi
ng, till you come to see him. So I said to 
him, ﬁChaim, would you go with me?ﬂ He said
, ﬁYes, to save a person™s life.ﬂ So I went 
with him, and he took the medi
cine, and he got better, and I 
had to promise him, I said, 
ﬁLook, my  father doesn ™t like me,ﬂ right away  I used my father. I don™t even live with 

him, ﬁdoesn™t want -- like you, doesn™t want
 me to ma rry m -- y -- me. Why don™t you go 
to Italy with the transport, and I™ll meet 
you there afterwards?ﬂ In the meanwhile, it™s a 
long story, I met Cornelius. I thought I fall in
 love with him, and I thought to my self -- 
and he asked me to ma rry him. And he said
, ﬁIt would be a good time. My two friends, 
my best two friends are coming back from Italy,
ﬂ they left to go to buna -- San Paolo, or 
Buenos Aires, I don™t know wh ere it was. ﬁT
hey™re coming back, could we get married?ﬂ 
And we got ma -- we were get 
-- we got married, and Barbie
, she should [indecipherable] 
went back to Italy, and acc
identally they met Tommy. And 
Tommy  said, ﬁOh, you come

from Bindermichl, my  fiancée is coming.ﬂ And he
 took out that picture, and th is woman 
didn™t mean that it was that it was that seri
o u s. So she says -- Barbie, she says, ﬁI™m 
sorry, your fiancée just 
married our best friend.ﬂ But befo
re that I went with the opera 
singer from Romania. I went with the guy that 
went -- also from Romania, that went with 
the King sisters. And one woman was very je
alous, and she said to 
my father, ﬁHow can 
you let her go out so mu ch, with  so many men?
ﬂ He said, ﬁIt™s better too many men than 
just one. So I™m sure n o thing will happen.ﬂ 
And my father didn™t 
have anything to say 
about who I™ll go out or wh at I do anyway . Bu
t he liked  Co rnelius, I don™t know why. 
And I said, ﬁYou know, Papa, he is half Jewi
sh, he is not even Jewish.ﬂ He says, ﬁYou 
will make something, I know you, you™ll 
make him Jewish. Don™t -- I™m not worried 
about it.ﬂ And he gave him -- I™ll never forg
et -- my  husband hates 
fish. And he gave 
him, he said, ﬁWould  you like a drink with  a 
piece of herring?ﬂ Of course, Co rnelius was 
a gentleman. You know, he was so debonair, I 
think that what impressed me, h e wore that 
hat with the pipe, you know, he was very we
ll dressed, I™ll show y
ou pictures. And th at 
what impressed me so mu ch about him. A
nd I brought him uppa -- and we were in the 
room eating, and the father gives him a piece 
of herring, was a gentleman, he start eating 
that herring, and he chewed and he chewed, 
and he chewed. And I said, ﬁPapa, go out and 
help Ro cholla in the kitchen.ﬂ And we were
 on th e second floor, and I said, ﬁCornelius, 

spit it out right away ,ﬂ you know. And then
 when I speak German, because the only 
language that we can communicate, and what Co
rnelius did a lot for me
, is that he helped 
me go to school, and then in Windham, there 
were the big bed, and then I was e -- and we

were married already, and a fri
end of ours was lying on the 
other side, and we were -- I 
was doing my  homework. I was also at the 
theater in Austria, and the -- in the 
kammershpeeler. But Cornelius ma
de my  father, and he made me quit it, because they 
saw -- there was a play -- I -- I don™t have very 
perfect legs, so I always had to wear long 
clothes. So I played the 
maid in the kammershpeel -- 
you know how beautiful the 
kammershpeeler varm, with the chandelier, a
nd everything. I played  a maid the harem 
house. How do you say it? It was a -- a film 
made, and also a movie, segments of it in 
English. The harem house, you know, with  the 
maid, where the father 
says tyrin down, do 
everything, this and this a
nd that, and he was there.  
Q: [indecipherable] 
A: The head  of the house, 
I forgot what the thing was.
 And I played that in the 
kammershpeeler. Then Cornelius 
saw the leading lady walking around in  a bra, from one 
room to the other. An d he said 
to my father, he said, ﬁBerrik,
 do you like that?ﬂ My father 
said, ﬁNo, but I have no contro l over her, ma
ybe you can do something.ﬂ So th ey did 
something, and that was the end of my  theate
r career -- career. Anyway, what I want to 
tell you, I went to art school, and I learned ho
w to  -- to design clothes. What can you do 
in that little time? But I had it 
in me from my father, that™s one thing you -- he was one of 
the best tailors. And my  dress won first prize,
 and I™ll never forget it. It was a ro yal blue 
dress that I designed. Was with the high 
neck, royal blue like a crepe suz -- a crepe 
material that™s silk. And it had a big Japane
se pocket I put on it. I must have seen it 
somewhere or something. And then  the belt went
 in, right into the pocket, and it tied. And 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053
  
 
 
 
29
then I put on the model big, red jewelry on
 the royal blue, with big, red earring, and 
beautiful black marble. It won 
first prize. So that was it. 
Q: Wha -- 
A: And when I got married -- yeah, go ahead. 

Q: Wh-what yar -- what year arewe roughly now? Is that 1946? 
A: We™re roughly on the end 
of 1946, as I was going al
ready, with  Corn elius. 
Q: Actually, I -- I have a few fo
llow up questions now, but I -- 
A: Okay, let™s -- 
Q: -- we should -- I should [indecipherable] 
A: -- can we -- can I go to the bathroom? 

Q: Yes, I just want to say my
 little thing. This is the end of
 tape one, side B, interview 
with Marsha Loen. 
End of Tape One, Side B

Beginning Tape Two, Side A 
Q: -- interview with Marsha Loen. This is ta
pe number two, side A. Marsha, I have about 
three questions now that I just kind of
 toss out before you [indecipherable] 
A: Okay. Just go ahead, Regina. 
Q: Question number one, it was not difficult 
for you to live in Austria, and speak the 
German language, wh en you had been actua
lly in the German concen tration camp ? 
A: Abso lutely not, and I™ll tell you why. Can I tell you why? 

Q: Please, yes. 
A: I™m even driv ing a German car, because 
you cannot go on hating all your life, you 
only hurt yourself. And that is what I learne
d here in school, wh en  I took a couple of 
semesters from psychology, after I finished 
high school, and junior -- college. Because -- 
Q: But when you™re -- 

A: -- I me -- I don™t say I™m in love with the 
people that -- that -- 
the offspring that the 
people that did it to me, but I cannot also
 hate, because I™m only going to  hurt my self. 
And language is a culture, and th e German 
is a very good car, because I get a very good 
trade-in on it. So that™s 
the answer for you, Regina. 
Q: But even at that time, when
 everything was still so close. 
A: It bothered me to a certain extent that 
I don™t feel nothing. It did bother me, but I 
didn™t feel anything about it. I™m sorry to 
say that, maybe it™s wrong. But, you know, to 
hate is to hurt yourself, and that I™ve learne
d from the beginning as I was liberated, with 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053
  
 
 
 
31
the Russians, with everything else. If you ha
te, you only hurt your
self. Without even 
going to  school, I knew about it. I felt about it, let™s say, this way.  
Q: The other question I had wa
s, did you ever meet a vak
ovna actually at that time? 
A: No. Not till after eig h t years, or seven year
s I was in this country . I didn™t even know 
survivor exist for about seven years in 
this country . That is another story.  
Q: Well that we shall definitely
 talk about that a little later. 
A: Oh yeah, they we™
ll finish this soon. 
Q: Oh yeah, yeah. And -- and 
the last question is though, was it important for you to 
some degree that Cornelius was al so a su
rvivor? Did you talk 
about where you came 
from, or was that not that -- 

A: Shall I tell you something? First place, Corn
elius was a different survivor that I was. 
He had a Christian mother that was a 
Righteous Christian that impressed me 
tremendously. She saved 32 Jews. In fact, sh
e has right now a tree in Jerusalem. And 

she™s in one of our guides in the mu seum as a 
Righteo us Christian, in the same guide th at 
Schindler is, and Wallenberg . Second place, he
 was a gentleman. Third place, he came 
from Yugoslavia, where the lot of
 his family was killed, too, 
in Novosad. And third place, 
he was a good lo oking man, he was well dres
sed, and he was clean. And that was the 
most important thing to me. I don™t care if 
he would have been -- I don™t know what. And 
the language that we spoke and could under
stand each other was only German, because 
he doesn™t speak Yiddish -- Jewish. I didn™t 
speak Hungarian, or Yu goslavian, or any 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053
  
 
 
 
32
other language, or English. He
 spoke 12 languages, I didn™t. 
I wasn™t that bright. I was 
bright, but not that bright. So
, it didn™t bother me at all. 
Q: So what were -- what were your plans even
tually, then ? You did not intend to  stay in 
Austria? 
A: Definitely not. Before I met C o rnelius, I was the biggest Zionist that ever existed. 
Smuggling the people over the 
border to Palestine. In fact, Ben-Gurion™s what was his 
name, Shorette was at my  wedding, and I wa
s crying, because I had to go to  America, 
because Cornelius™ family was here. And he 
said, ﬁMarsha, we need people like you in 
America, to o. Don™t cry.ﬂ So it was a sadness 
to a certain extent, a sadness in me that I 
couldn™t go to Palestine. But 
another thing I went to a co untry th at I thought I would 
never got -- get to. You understand what I -- 
in a way it was selfish, but I was happy. 
Q: We™ll talk a little bit more about that when
 we -- when we get th ere. So how did you 
get there, actually? Wh
at -- what happened? 
A: What happened? Ho w 
did I get to America? 
Q: To America, yeah. 

A: Yeah. I married Cornelius,
 Corn elius had a brother here
 that came in 1939 for the 
World Fair, on his honeymoon. Lost all our m
oney. In fact, when I married Cornelius he 
was very rich, because I also went for rich people, because 
I didn™t want to have no food 
again. And then we got a lette
r that in 1947, when we got 
married, his mother and father 
were supposed to go through Vienna. And I 
had a false passport, a
nd he had a passport, 
and we were supposed to meet
 them in Vienna, and then th
e thing was changed, and they  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053
  
 
 
 
33
went thro ugh Prague, they went 
by plane. They shipped a lot 
of antiques, that my father-
in-law was going to  open an antique shop. I d
on™t want to go into  a big story about it, 
everything was stolen, and we co
uldn™t rip -- we were making 30 dollars a week, and paid 
a private detective all o v er. Nothing was foun
d except a couple of paintings that were 
between the bedding that came in  those empty cas
es. So this is the firs
t time I lost money, 
and I didn™t feel sorry for me. I felt sorry fo
r my mother-in-law, an
d father-in-law that 
had an  estate with maids and chau ffer, and tw
o cars in Europe, you know what it means. 
A Fiat, and a Chevrolet for th
e boys. And ift -- went to San Marco wh en David -- when 
Connor was three years old, and all over Switzerland, and Cornelius went to -- to college 

in Budapest, and to Sw itzerland, and -- very , 
very rich people. And she had to  come and 
start crocheting, and start work. I felt ra
ther sorry for them
 than for myself. 
Q: So how did you -- how did 
you get over then, by boat? 
A: So we came, and we went from Bindermic
hl, we went to Bremerhaven, and there™s 
decided th ere is a boat going th
rough New Orleans, if you -- 
and it would take 14 days 
rather than more. And we went 
on that boat. Then that was 
after -- we were married in 
™47, that was in August 1949. And we went 
on th e boat, and being that Corn elius spoke 
so many languages, he was invited as a interpre
ter to speak over the tape recorder, and we 
came on the boat early. Came in on the boat earl
y, I was made shtudmarder -- the head of 
that old woman, barra -- because the wo men and the men slept separate. And I met the 

two Ire officers. And like I said, I was pretty
 good looking, had a good sense of humor, 
knew how to  dance, I won a couple of conteste
d. And that rock and roll in Austria. Not 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053
  
 
 
 
34
with Co rnelius, he™s a lousy dancer, with hi
s friend. An d being in  the theater, you know, 
and ev erything. And I made very good friends
 with the Ire officer. 
And I got very sick 
going th rough th e channel, very sick. And, you
 know, being th at Co
rnelius was with the 
Joint, and part director of the Joint Dist
ribution Co mmittee, I got 
an apartment in the 
displaced camp that they had a telephone.
 And through that I met a lot of black 
marketeers. Ve -- he never did it, because he
 was afraid, God forbid
, he couldn™t go to 
America. S o  even when he lost all his money,
 he wrote a letter to his sister-in-law, did 
my  tuxedo arrive? She s -- she wrote him back
, ﬁCornelius, with all the money th at you 
have now, you don™t need a t
uxedo.ﬂ The first thing didn™t bot
her him, the money, or the 
diamonds, or everything else, it 
bothered him is the tuxedo. So
 what happened is is that 
when we lived there, and we
 had that telephone, a lot of black marketeers would come 
over and make telephone calls, and everything 
else. And they went to England, and they  
brought me beautiful clothes, you know, as
 [indecipherable]. Bu
t I had a maid from 
Dabotchka, Maria, I™ll never forget. And they
 would co me in, and if I wasn™t at home, 
and they  would go into  the kitchen in the 
displaced camp, I had a beautiful apartment -- 
Wiesenthal, from the -- from th
e Museum of Tolerance, lived above me. I gave him a 
party line, and I gave him a maid
. And I wouldn™t have anything 
to do with that man if he 
said boo. 
Q: How come? 
A: Because he™s the biggest pho
ny in the world. I™m sorry to
 say that on tape. Anyway -- 
and if you want to cut it out, you™re welcome to it. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053
  
 
 
 
35
Q: No, actually, I would like to
 ask you more about that. 
A: Anyway, and the thing is is that that w
ill come later, with the 
museum. And the thing 
is is that I had a telephone, I had all those 
clothes, we were on the boat, and I didn™t know 
where Co nnor is, Corn elius didn™t know where 
I -- all of a sudden I didn™t know if I was 
in love with him, if I was not
 in love with him. And I st
art throwing up. And that Ire 
officer was already a little bit 
in love with me, I had a feeling. So  he came down to the 
thing, and he picked  me up -- at that time I 
was only a size seven. I wasn™t what I was 
right n -- he picked me up, in that pink robe
 [indecipherable] and he gave me his cabin, 
and he went to live with the other Ire o
fficer. And my husband, when I saw him on the 
deck, I got -- I got well after I saw him. And my 
husband stayed 
with me in that -- in that 
cabin, and everybody, all of thos
e survivors that were on that boat, thought that I had an 
affair with the tyrit officer. 
At my age, just married, you 
know, and everything else. But I 
let them talk. And my husband 
was with me, and we had that
 cabin over, and we were 14 
days on the sea. And I got better, and I went 
out to mingle with the people, and I arranged 
a dance on the boat. And, yo
u know, 14 days over the Mississi
ppi, in order to go to New 
Orleans, was a long time. And varabul Connor 
start feeling better, I start feeling better. I 
had nice clothes, and I had that friend, that 
Ire officer. In fact, he came to Los Angeles 
one time, when I was very unhappy, because he
 left me a PO box, in case I™m not happy, 
to send him a letter. And I was unhappy becaus
e in the beginning we
 lived with our in-
laws, and so on. So I was a little unhappy, till 
I got that letter, and he came over, and he 
said, ﬁAll you do, mo ve out or I take Marsha with me.ﬂ  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053
  
 
 
 
36
Q: So you had a protector 
there. A friend, friend. 
A: Yeah, t -- I had a protector, and a friend. A
nd he -- he di -- he was in love with me, 
maybe, I don™t know. But I did no
t have an affair with him. 
I™m telling you, on tape, or on 
the tape, or off a tape. But everybody thought I did. And we went 14 days 
[indecipherable]. And we arrived to New Orl
eans, and of course, if we arrived in New 
Orleans -- Cornelius was still 
the gentleman, and he still knew a little more like all 
displaced people, because he was -- a
nd he beat the champion in Ping Pong. 
Q: On the boat, or in the -- 
A: No, in  New Orleans.  
Q: In New Orleans. 

A: In New Orleans. We were in the Jewish 
-- the Jewish geminda vizakmindas in -- in -- 
in -- in -- 
Q: Nay -- neighborhood [indecipherable] 
A: No, th e gemine, the Jewish farbaltung. Th
e -- the Jews that took care of the people. 
We were the first boat to arrive in New Orle
an s. I was so stupid, I took my  pearls, and 
rings, and things, and I was afraid to take it 
with me at th e displaced camp, send it with -- 
somebody smuggled -- brought it to my  -- to my
 mo ther-in-law befo re 1947, before they 
left, and -- and theirs were -- everything wa
s stolen, including my  th ings. When  I came 
into New Orleans, they didn™t 
even look at it, they were so 
happy to see us, the first boat, 
you know. And we were stayi
ng with all the Jews, it was 
like a temple, you know, like 
the Jewish Federation here. You know, there wa
s arranged a -- a big room with food, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053
  
 
 
 
37
the bananas and everything. Because on th e 
boat all I got -- I was invited once to the 
captain™s table, and they  ask me what would 
I like. I said, ﬁI would like a piece of black 
bread. I can™t stand that cotton any more.ﬂ 
And then they gave 
me a bowl of cottage 
cheese and fruit, and I said, ﬁWould you do 
me a favor, would you separate the fruit and 
the cottage cheese?ﬂ You know, with
 me there was no nothing, cap
tain or no captain, if I 
had to say something, I said it. And I star
t helping the people on the boat. You know, 
there was a little boy -- she died, and he™s sick
, and now he™s a very
 famous pharmacist, 
and he™s very well to -- I haven™t seen hi
m for maybe 20 years. His name was Leon 
Lolinka was his name, and he -- his father
 was from my town, and I knew his mother. 
And I brought fo od for him, I had food brough
t for him, and juices that was brought to 
my  cabin and ev erything. And we
 arrived in New Orleans like I 
said, and we were in that 
geminda. My husband right away played  Ping 
Pong, you know, his lif
e, cause that what 

they did also in the di
splaced camp with his 
cousin, played chess, 
played Ping Pong. He 
beat the champion, and a Jewish woman thatwas -- owned a couple of apartment houses, 
was very impressed with us, the way we were
 dressed, than the other people, and my  
husband beating the champion and every -- she 
invited .us for dinner, and as we were 
walking, I had my camera, and I stopped, and I 
wanted to take a picture of a little black 

girl in a yellow dress. She was the mo st gor
geous, beautiful African-American I™ve ever -
- African-Americ -- at that tim
e we called them black -- African-American girl I™ve ever 
seen, and she came to me, and she said, ﬁWe don™
t do those things here.ﬂ I said, ﬁI just 
finished being in a concentration camp, in
 a displaced camp, in a Russian camp, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053
  
 
 
 
38
you™re coming to tell me that I cannot take 
a picture of that woman because she has a 
different color skin? Forget 
your dinner, I™m not coming, invite somebody else.ﬂ And I 
walked away from her. And that rich woman,
 that I could have had a lot out of her, 
believe me, but I didn™t want anything to
 do with her. Ab solu
tely nothing. She 
apologized, and she said, ﬁThis is the rules,
ﬂ you know, ﬁand I™m Jewish too.ﬂ You know, 
and I said, ﬁNo, to me you are not Jewish, 
because if you would have been Jewish you 
would have done something ab
out me, and about my two little 
sisters, and you wouldn™t 
let me -- tell me that I can™t take a pict
ure of that woman. It was the end of it. 
Q: Was anybody interested where you we
re coming from, so to speak, in -- 
A: Oh, in  New Orleans they were
 -- not that interested, they we
re just trying to be nice to 
us. Interested nobody was. Nobody 
wanted  to hear the sad storie
s, and at that time I really  
wasn™t read to tell them yet, to tell you th e hone
st truth, as I arrived. And th e -- like I said, 
we arrived, and I to -- my mother lived in 
a -- mother-in-law lived in a big house, she was 
living in  a shack. It was a better neighborho
od than Bull Heights,
 and she was work ing 
already. And, you know, there was no money.
 My brother-in-law was broke. My  father-
in-law send him money for th
e boys, and when everybody went
 into airplanes, he we -- 
he went in to lawnmo wers. They didn™t take 
him in the army  because he had something 
with his eyes, and he lost that money, 
and his money, and hi
s wife™s money, and 
everybody else, and we were completely broke. 
Q: And that was already in Los Angeles, or that was [indecipherable] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053
  
 
 
 
39
A: In Los Angel -- everything that -- no, in 
New Orlean s we were there a couple of days, 
and then  we took a train direct to Los Angeles.
 And th e 70 dollars that he laid out fo r us, I 
paid him back, because I didn™
t want nothing from nobody. 
And we live with my mother-
in-law and father-in-law like I said, and they
 -- Connor was the youngest one, and I start 
work ing in a factory. We had to  live, we had 
to eat. I start work in a factory, and what 
happened  is is the foreman wan -- was on vaca
tion -- like I say, I was very handy going -- 
work ing already on clothes, a
nd ev erything. And the man that owned the place, his name 
was Rubin, I will also never forget, he came 
and he said to me, ﬁW
hy don™t you give out 
the work? Why don™t you act as
 the foreman?ﬂ Work
ed  there couple of days, and ev ery 
night I came home I was throwing up, and Connor couldn™t get a job. So  we went to the 

Jewish Federation, that I work 
now for, at that time, because we came with the affidavit, 
so we got nothing from HIAS
, nothing from nobody. So we
 had to  do it -- everything 
ourself. So we went there, a
nd they  gave him a job as a -- a watchman in a mo tel -- the 
[indecipherable] the mote
l is still standing. That man didn
™t ever know what a gun means, 
or anything at all the gun. And then  my  fath
er-in-law would bring th
e papers and read it 
for me, because I wasn™t that 
good in English that time, h o w many people were killed in 
motels, with guns, with that. 
And then I didn™t want
 to tell him that I™m sick, so I would 
throw up at night, because I couldn™t take th
e sweat, the smell of the factory. Not that I 
was a snob, I just couldn™t take it. And then  
Corn elius got another job with a friend, in -- 
with German lenses, through his brother. Not 
very mu ch paid, and 
I -- my mother-in-law 
got me a job with a designer, Suzy . Su zy with
 a designer, designed sweaters, and sk irts

with felt appliquéds, it was very much in fash
ion. Sold  it to Saks, and everything -- and 
we had a store on the strip. And wh ere we lived
 is, we lived near the strip. It w as between 
the strip and Santa Monica, and at that time 
the strip was the place. There was the -- the 
mola -- th-the LaRue, there was the Mocambo, Ciro, everythi
ng was there. And that was 
the place there, a main
 shop, and the factory downstairs, and I worked there. She was 
very good to me, very 
good to me, because I 
caught on just like that, one, two, three. And 
she would come down, and she would say, ﬁW
hat do you think, what should we design?ﬂ 
And she lived above, in  the better area, over Suns
et, at that time, o n  Clark Street. It -- it™s 
sounded center now, where the B
illage Hotel is, but it was at Clark Street at that time. 
And we moved out from my  mo ther-in-law™s, a
nd everything they  spend on us, we wrote 
it down, and the minute we made 200 dollars, we 
paid them all back. But wh at we did is -
- my  teeth were all broken from the calcium 
I didn™t have, and they  work ed on it in 
Austria, and they ruined it even
 more. So I went into a den
tist that was down the street, 
on Santa Monica and Clark Street, someone se
nt me. There was a Thrifty drugstore, and 
his office was upstairs. And I made very good 
fr -- I made very easy friend, I made very 
good friends with him. He st
art working on me, gave me a 
good price. I didn™t want it for 
nothing, and I paid him off slowly. And we got 
to be the best of fri
end. This were our 
first friend in America, the Ve
stliss. And what happe
ned is is my fath
er-in-law went in 
the baseme nt in the May Co mp any right there, and bought me a black dress, we were 

going out, so wh at I did is, I had a colorful 
scarf -- because the clothes that I brought 
from Europe, I couldn™t wear, with those 
big pads. Connor™s shoes were  squeak -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053
  
 
 
 
41
squeaking, you know. It was 
complete different life, a complete different scene. And 
these were people that already had catal
ogs, and -- and -- and live -- lived in Beverly 
Wood, in Beverly Hills, in the valley, and so
 on. And eve -- they got to be very good 
friends of mine. And I was working at Su zy™s
, and Su zy went to Paris. And her husband, 
that was a very good looking man went afte
r me, and I had to quit. And I didn™t worry, 
because I had a job waiting for me at Sidney™s.
 And Sidney on LaSeneca was also one of 
the most exclusive -- and all I needed, clothe
s. Now, when I was at Suzy™s, I went -- I 
met Marlen a Dietrich, I met all th e movie star
s. Marlena Dietrich, I called her a whore, 
because she -- I didn™t -- wasn™t afraid of he
r, because she didn™t pay her bills anyways 
[indecipherable] I -- I -- I said 
-- I didn™t know what™s the di
fferent is in English between 
Madame and Madame at that time. So Su zywas downstairs, and she said, ﬁI would like 

Suzy to fit me.ﬂ I was upstairs. I said, ﬁSuzy,
 the Madame is here.ﬂ She said, ﬁIn America 
we say Madame.ﬂ Say -- and I knew that 
she understood German
, and Suzy was from 
Austria, her father was a Austri
an actor, so I, ﬁSuzy, the hura 
is here.ﬂ The whore is here, 
in German. 

Q: My God. 
A: And, you know, I wasn™t afraid of the dev
il, you know. But Suzy, they -- in fact, I had 
a [indecipherable] too, because the -- she had a 
publicity lady there at that time, she paid 
200 dollars a month, was a lot of money in
 the 1950 -- 19 fift -- 1949 - 1950. And she 
said, you know -- the publicity lady came in, 
she took some picture and everything else, 
and she put in a magazine me and Suzy , an
d cutting out a poodle. And Su zy had a poodle 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053
  
 
 
 
42
named Lulu. It said, ﬁSuzy and partner work
ing on a Lulu creation.ﬂ Do you know that 
woman didn™t come in for two we
eks i -- to the st -- to the -- 
to the factory? I had to run 
the factory, because she did no
t like it that I was with her in
 the magazine, the public -- 
but it wasn™t my fault, in fact, that actress
, Barbara Britten was modeling for us at that 
magazine at that time. It wasn™t my fault, I 
didn™t even  want to sit there. Who cared if I™m 
in a magazine or not? All 
I was worrying, where is the next bread co ming from? Where 
am I going to pay the detective 
to look for our stuff, and so 
on, you know. But at night -- 
she didn™t live very far, and she would have
 an idea, she was very creative. She would 
have an id ea -- in fact, she was engaged to
 Groucho Marx at one time. And she would 
have an id ea, and she would say -- she ma
rried that guy, Larry
. Why don™t you come 
over, Pasternak is here with his wife around 
th e pool an d everything, and we can wo rk on 
the -- on the creation, I have something in  my
 -- so we would work
 for hours. She never 
paid me overtime, but she always was very go
od to me, and she bought me certain things 
that I didn™t have, and so on. 

Q: So you -- 
A: But I forgot to tell you, when we moved 
into that little apartmen
t, over the garage, a 
rent control apartment, Al and Juliet West
, who went and signed 
for me at Sears and 
Roebuck, so we get it on payments, and we 
bought our bedroom -- we Lysoled it, and we 
painted it. And at that time,
 it was not modern, wo oden floors, but it was wooden floors, 
we shined  it. And we had red couches with 
pink troracks. And we 
didn™t have a dining, 
we just had a dining area. And all my friends
 that lived in Beverly Hills, and everywhere 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053
  
 
 
 
43
else, they liked to come to -- 
to my house to eat, because 
I learned how to co ok from my  
mo ther-in-law. She wa -- she went to Budape
st to study co oking busin ess, to teach the 
cooks how to cook. So I got to
 be a very good cook
, so everybody liked
 to come to my 
house. I me t a lot of interesting people, very
 interesting people, because I met the Essex, 
they should rest in peace, th
ey were all older than I wa
s. He was writing the Mickey 
Spillane movies. I met other peop
le, doctors -- in fact, he had a -- this was the funniest 
thing because I wasn™t used to
 it. At one time we lived in Beverly Wood at that time, on 
Sawyer Street, was a v ery -- it™s still a very 
expensive street. And 
he gave a Halloween 
party, and I went as Auntie Mame, and he we
nt as my follower. And I -- I took a bracelet, 
and I had jewelry, and I made my self a very 
fancy thing, with my  hair up, you know. And 
I come into his house, and on th e drapes were
 hanging a big -- I hate to say it on the cam 
-- on tape -- a big skeleton with  a wiener hang
ing out. But they all 
came in diapers. The 
doctors, the lawyers, those intelligent peop -- they came in diapers.
 One came as Adam 
and Eve, with fig leafs. And here I was worri
ed, you know, this going on. And th en I had 
another problem with them, because a lot of t
hose intellectuals were on the pink side. Not 
red, but on the pink side, b
ecause their background was th
eir parents run away from the 
Bolsheviks. You know, from the czar, Bolshevik,
 whatever it is. So one time they took 
me to a theater, and we saw a show, and it was a union tee -- I don™t know what it was. 
And somebody was talking against America.And I s -- got up and said, ﬁWhat?ﬂ And I 
start walking out the theater. And four of th
em went after me, my friends, that is -- 
nothing should happen 
to me, that the people
 shouldn™t kill me. They didn™t tell me where 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053
  
 
 
 
44
they were taking me. But I ha
d a wonderful time, they are s
till wonderful people, they™re 
very old, very old, but wonde
rful people. And Juliet and Al, Elizabeth and Rolfe are my  
very closest friend. Elizabeth and Rolfe, they 
had a big drugstore on th
e corner of Fairfax, 
a old drugstore. And Juliet and Al, Juliet -- wh
en I had my  baby, David, I wasn™t allowed 
to have ch ildren, because in the concentra
tion camp , you mu st have heard on the tape, 
they did something to me by looking fo r gold
. And I tricked my  husband into  having 
David. When I had David, an
d I couldn™t affo rd, and I couldn™t get a nurse, it was my  
first house, I had a little small house in th
e valley, where I opened already my own 
business, that Al -- with the he
lp  from Al, that wrote me a blank ch eck, if I need money, 
that he got back every penny, plus. And eliz
 -- help with Eliz
abeth and Rolfe. All 
American friends, I didn™t know that -- that -- 
that survivors exist, only that person that I 
came on the boat, I told you, with the little b oy. I came to visit him in Bull Heights. 
Corn elius bought a -- a old car, and we drove 
there every two week s to visit him, he 
never told me survivor exis
ted, because he thought th
ey weren™t good enough for 
Cornelius. That was so stupid. 
Anyway, so what happ
ened is is I did this -- where was I? 
In the middle of telling you the story. 
Q: You talked about David [indecipherable] 

A: About David. Wh en David was born, she ga
ve me a maid, Myrtle, 
that brought up her 
children, for months. Fo r months, because I ha
d the studio already, that I didn™t tell you, 
in Sherman Oaks, to work 
for me. This is what kind of a friends she was.  
Q: Maybe this is a good time to -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053
  
 
 
 
45
A: Rest? 
Q: -- to stop this one.  
A: Okay . 

Q: This is the end of tape two, si
de A, interview with Marsha Loen. 
End of Tape Two, Side A 
Beginning Tape Two, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of a United States
 Holocaust Memorial Mu
seum interview with 
Marsha Loen. This is type -- this is tape 
number two, side B. I would like to ask you a 
question about your son, 
David. First of all, when  was he born, and -- 
A: Regina, can I interrupt you?
 Why don™t you let me tell yo
u befo re David, wh en I went 
to school, and I started work ing on the mu seum? 

Q: Okay, go right ahead. 
A: And then I™ll tell y ou ho
w we bought the -- okay. 
Q: Okay, fine. 
A: I went to -- I decided -- my husband™s fa
mily was very educated , and I decided that 
I™m not going to let them see that -- like 
I was born under a stone, somewhere on th e 
beach, especially my brother-in-law that wa
s a philoso pher, and very intelligent man, he 
just died about si -- three months ago, at 85 . And what I did is, Cornelius went with me 
with the streetcar from Santa Monica to Holly
wood, and every night after work, I went to 
Hollywood High. And then, wit
hout knowing any survivors or
 anything, somebody told 
me they are going to  build a mo nument, a
nd they are having a meeting on Vermont. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053
  
 
 
 
46
Holo caust monument. So I went there, and I s 
-- the meeting, and all of a sudden, my  part 
of the committee. So I prayed 
--  played through them from sc
hool that night when they 
had a meeting, and I helped build th at mo
nument -- I mean the -- the museum. And in 
1978, when we opened the museum, I was ch airi
ng it, and that why I wanted to interrupt 
you to tell you, you are -- you also ask me why 
am I ma d at Wiesenthal, and I want to tell 
you why. Because before we opened the muse
um, Mr. Wiesenthal was supposed to speak 
for us. I shouldn™t say that on tape, but I have
 to get it off my  chest. And maybe I™ll get 
fired for it, but I don™t care. Before we
 opened the mu seum, Mr. Wiesenthal was 
supposed to speak for us. Ou
r chair was Mr. Silverman, American Jew, and we had a 
meeting in his house. And I don™t -- I forget
 the name from the old man that came, and 
said that he got a letter from Wiesenthal that
 he wants five dollars per head more, like 
cattle. And we couldn™t even afford it to op en the museum, how can we afford to give 
him five dollar more to  be our -- our speaker at
 the mu  -- at the big dinner, at the opening. 
And then the Wiesenthal Center came to us --
 that is now the Wiesen
thal Center, with the 
proposition they™ll give us 25,000 dollars for hi m. And being that we couldn™t get it more 

from the federation, because they gave us a lo
t, we sold Wiesenthal
 for 25,000 dollars to 
the Wiesenthal Center. The Los Angel -- at 
that time we were the Martyr™s Memorial, 
and the Holo caust Museum, we just changed our
 name to the Los Angeles Museum of the 
Holocaust because it™s much 
easier to -- to get to un
derstand it. And that™s why 
Wiesenthal for me is 
absolutely poo, and the reas -- I 
have been once at the Wiesenthal 
Center, and that was with a delegation -- th is comes later -- with a delegation from -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053
  
 
 
 
47
from Russia, that came to see what we did,
 and they saw our museum, they saw the 
Wiesenthal mu seum. And let me tell you someth
ing, a very famo us man from there, that 
helped build the mu seum, behind the synagogue
 in Moscow said that our museum is a 
Holocaust Museum, theirs is a 
D isneyland Holocaust. I™m sorry
 to say it on tape, but this 
what it is, and if ever anybody
 hears it, please fo
rgive me, if you™re interested in the 
Wiesenthal Center, because it™s strictly 
too much to do -- 
I™m so -- corne -- 
Q: Cornelius? We™re hearing a little noise here, okay? 
A: And Wiesenthal is -- he sh
ould live to 120, I ha
ve nothing against him, but he made 
himself a name. I know him because he lived 
upstairs, across from us -- leef -- because 
this was the elite of the DP camp. And acro
ss from us lived a name -- a man by the name 
of Ignatz. We called him -- what -- called 
him, Ignatz? And he was prosecuting the 
Hungarian Nazis. And then Wi
esenthal took it all over.  
Q: That was in Linz, in Austria. 

A: That was in Linz, in Austria, in Bindermich
l. And if he denies it, he™s a liar. Anyway , 
let™s go back to -- now, we
 can go back to David. 
Q: Well -- well, let™s talk about 
David a little later then, because -- 
A: Okay . 

Q: -- you just began to talk ab
out you work  wi
th the museum. 
A: David was born th en, already, so David wa
s born in  1958. The doctor said I couldn™t 
have children, because first pl
ace our bloods are different, mine and Cornelius, and I was 
afraid. They  say the first child it™s nothing, bu
t I was afraid. Also, when  -- if you hear my  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053
  
 
 
 
48
tape in -- in the museum, they
 took me into a room, and th
ey looked for 
gold. And I was 
very young, and they  did some
thing there, so it was very -- 
the doctor didn™t want -- they 
didn™t want me -- but I wanted a child, because when my father -- in ™57 they brought my 
father, that survived 
Dachau. I worked so ha
rd for the Gateway of Mental Health hospital 
in Los Angeles. I and Corneliu
s were fundraising in the valley. So they surprised me on a 
television show. It was called at th at time, 
ﬁIt Could Be You.ﬂ And 
they told me I was 
going to  have -- announce my  fashion show, 
cause I™m g iving for Gateway for mental 
health. And they came to
 pick me up, and th en they su
rprised me with my father. And 
what happened is my father cam
e, and he came into the -- to 
my  house, and he says, ﬁOh, 
a Jewish girl, a bizdatnitsi, no children.ﬂ An
d it practically killed me
. So -- and then my 
mother-in-law and father-in-law was in a very
, very bad accident, and the two sons were 
so good, and they were
 so terrific, and that day I deci
ded -- and I knew my mother was -- 
just has to snap a finger, she 
had a baby. I remember this as 
a child, and in 
ghetto, she wa 
-- a ba -- baby was born. Sh e was made before
 the ghetto, was born in  ghetto. And I said 
to my self, ﬁI™m going to get preg nant, I™m 
gong to  trick him into it.ﬂ And I got pregnant. 
And being that I am a d esigner, I wore a certain
 kind of clothes, that he never noticed it 
till about the third or fourth  month, and 
then I told him. And I wouldn™t go to a 
gynecologist, but again, one of my  model™s husband™s was a very famous gynecologist. 
He also charged me a big amount, because hethought I was so filthy 
rich, because of my 
studio, and his wife models for me . And I 
went to him, and I was pregnant, and all 
through the pregnancy we -- we did out gard en
 in our home -- in our new home, and we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053
  
 
 
 
49
did -- the front we added landscape, I -- landscaper. I was bleeding, and I never told the 
docto r, and I never told  -- and David was bor
n prematured. And I had the dachshund at 
that time th at was sick. And -- and I had my
 little house on Bervis in Van Nuys. And I 
opened in  ™53 ti -- my  studio, ameet studio 
in Sherman Oaks. And wh en I open ed the 
studio is my  friend th e Vestliss™, they he
lped  me, and who went looking with me, 
Elizabeth, because they
 had a big drugstore in the valley,
 and we found that place, and it 
was -- and I remodeled it in a early Americ
an, because I loved th e early American, 

because that for me presente
d the country that I came, an
d that gave me a home. And 
even in my house, in my first house, I ha
d the early American. 
In my little apartment 
behind the studio, I had the 
early American with the ho
oked rug. And now I go a little 
more modern. I got used to Amer
ica. Anyway, and what happened
 is is that I -- I -- I got 
pregnant, and I wo rk ed, and like I said, I brought
 my father out, and it upset me, and then 
when  my mother-in-law was in the accident, I said when I™m gone there wa -- nobody 
going to  be left, I have to have something. 
And I stuck it out, and David was born in  the 

eighth month. And he was -- I took him out -- he
 was about five pounds, because at that 
time they just build the Encino
 hospital, and it wasn™t far 
from my  -- from my  studio. So 
what happened is is I got -- and it was Mo
nday mo rning, I got terrible cramps, and I 
called a friend if she could take me. And she to
ok me in, and the doct
or said take her in 
right away, because I had -- delivering anot
her baby. And she was sitting in the front 
room, and doing a -- she told -- I found ou
t later doing a check, balancing your 
checkbook. That was all still Americans, not 
-- no surv ivors. I didn™t know any survivors. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053
  
 
 
 
50
And the -- they came out and 
th ey said, ﬁWhere can we get hold of Mr. Loen ?ﬂ And 
Cornelius™ office always on the ru -- on the 
road. And th -- she said
 -- th -- she says, 
ﬁWhy?ﬂ Said, ﬁMrs. Loen is being admitted.ﬂ 
So I said, ﬁI™m going 
to have a baby,ﬂ and 
all the checks were flying all over the waiti
ng room. My friend, the schultz. An yway, so 
what happened is David was 
born, and he was in a incuba
tor. And I had one stitch. One 
stitch, because I was pretty flexible. And th
en Fritz was sick, and he was in a -- in 
Tarzana in a hospital. So, I had the pe
ople wo rking fo r me in the studio. 
Q: Who was Fritz? 

A: Fritz was my little dachshund. And -- I t
ook him out from a pound, 
believe it or not. I 
gave him a home. And he was 
a pedigree. An d he had -- his 
b-behind legs was hurt -- was 
very bad, so I took him to th
e finest hospitals in Tarzana, 
very far away. So I would go 
and visit my baby in  the incubator, then visit 
Fritz, and then come ba
ck to work in the 
studio.  
Q: I™d like to ask you just two qui
ck questions for clarification. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: It would have been  dangerous for you 
to get a child? That was [indecipherable] 
A: Yes. I -- it told me -- 
when the doctor was putting me in
 the hospital -- what was his 
name, Cornell? I forgot, oh. 

Q: That™s alright. 
A: Oh, it™s -- we were -- we were so close. 
He was putting me in the hospital, he says, 
ﬁFirst I™m going to save your life, and th
en  I™m going to save the baby™s.ﬂ I said, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053
  
 
 
 
51
ﬁRobert,ﬂ rob -- I said, ﬁRobert,
 if my baby dies, I kill y ou.
 I went through eight months, 
and I™m going to kill you.ﬂ So 
you see, because I™ve done so
 much in the concentration 
camps, and afterwards, with charity, with rais
ing money, and everything else, said, ﬁGod 
couldn™t do this to me again.ﬂ And then, th
e hospital was so small, and I got terrible 
cramps. It was just built, a
nd they brought in -- in the 
next room a woman from -- from 
surgery, she said, ﬁKeep quiet.ﬂ 
That lady just came o u t, she 
said -- I said, ﬁB ut I™m wet.ﬂ 
I didn™t even know that you break water. I neve
r read up on it. So they found Robert right 

away, and he brought with him two docto rs, tw
o pediatricians, and he was putting in th at 
stitch, and I said, ﬁRobert, are you knitting 
or purling?ﬂ Because I design knitted clothes. 
This is already under anesthe
tic. I had a -- he had to give 
me a spinal because my water 
broke. An d then all of a sudden I hear the ot
her doctor, ﬁIs that you, Marsha?ﬂ It was Dr. 

Danielson, his wife was one of my clientel
e. S o  you see, I was surrounded by friends 
when  David was born. And I took him out of th
e incubator, and after six months I had to 
put him on a skim milk diet, thanks God. 
And he was reading and writing at two and a 
half years old. At three years old, he wa
s -- he knew ev ery president, he knew every 
composer. Now, he was not genius. I took 
him to UCLA. My father-in-law was a very, 
very intelligent man, and David 
was his life, so he spent a lot of time with David. David 
has -- has a photographic memory, like I do. I remember a lot of things as a child, don™t 
forget, that I went through. A lot I forget 
because I blocked it out, but a lot I rememb er. 
And David has a photographic me mo ry. So  one 
day, he was running up the steps in my  
father-in-law™s apartment, and he says -- and 
he™s reading the paper, 
he™s running up, he™s 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053
  
 
 
 
52
not -- he™s three years old, and he says, ﬁApp
a, Castro is in Mosc
ow.ﬂ Yeah, my father-
in-law should rest in peace, it was his life. 
One time he took a woode
n spoon, and he hit 
him on the behind. I™ll never forg et, he calle
d me up, and he said, ﬁAppa,ﬂ that™s an 
Hungarian father, he said, ﬁif you do it, it does
n™t hurt.ﬂ He loved him so much. In fact, I 
had to take him to the doctor that treated my 
father, because the day 
before he jumped on 
his bed an d everything, and I heard him in his 
room praying, and he said, ﬁPlease God, if 
I did something wrong, bring my  -- my  grandf
ather back as -- as a 
baby ag ain.ﬂ So I took 
him to his docto r, to my  father-in-law™s docto
r, and he told him, Dr. Cohen, that his 
grandfather was very sick, he could not surviv e,
 that, in fact, the last day he brought him 
a lot of joy by being there.  
Q: Did -- did you have any par
ticular hopes or plans for David 
that, as a -- as a survivor 
that made a connection to that? 
A: I™ll tell you something. I™ve seen a lot of
 things happen between my  American friends 
that were always Jewish. If the son doesn™
t get to be a doctor, or a pharmacist, or 
anything else, and those kids were very unh
appy. I never told David anything about the 
Holocaust till he went to go Ba
r Mitzvah. When -- wh
en he wouldn™t eat, I wouldn™t say I 
was hungry, why don™t you eat? 
When  he didn™t eat I would sa
y, ﬁDavid , you have to eat, 
there are so many children hung
ry in China.ﬂ He 
said, ﬁWhy don™t you adopt a couple?ﬂ 
That little fat monster told me that. But I ne
ver told David anythi
ng, anything. I never 
exposed him to it. David 
played Little League. I bur
ned my hands on the making 
hamburger there [indecipherable] did in my  li
fe, run from the studio, run to the -- to the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053
  
 
 
 
53
field, made the hamburgers when it was my
 day. He played Little League, he loved 
sports, he did judo, anything. In fact, he 
was -- when he was very little, he was very 
smart, but not coordinated. To -- my  docto r, 
Dr. Jessup, told me, ﬁWhy don™t you take 
him boxing or judo?ﬂ So I took him for judo. So
 in th e beginning he didn™t want to go in  
because he didn™t know
 how to tie his shoes. So I to
ld him, ﬁThen leave it open.ﬂ But 
later on, this was the best thing that I ever
 did. Bu t I never, never exposed  him to the 
Holo caust before he was able to understand
. And I won™t tell any, any ch ild about the 
Holo caust that is under 11 or 12 years old, 
because this is a very horrible story that 
happened, and it can affect their life. And esp
ecially my son, it was important to me that 
he doesn™t feel guilty because of me. That he
 doesn™t eat, or he doesn™t eat. H e didn™t 

want to be a doctor, he wanted 
to  be a sports re -- the reporter, fine. This is your life, you 
live it. At 21 he moved out of th e house, we 
moved to  the town  hous
e. Fine, you live your 
life. I™m not going to make scene. He is 40 ye
ars old, he is not married yet. I would love 
to have a grandchild, but if he doesn™t want to 
get married yet, if he want to play the field, 
fine, what do I care? 
Q: So when did you tell him 
a little bit about your expe
rience, and what happened? 
A: I told him before he went to -- he started studying for the Bar Mitzvah. I told him what 
happened , very slowly, and very  quietly, becau
se he didn™t want to study for his Bar 
Mitzvah. I had to get a private rabbi. I did 
not belong to a temple
, because -- this is 
another story by itself, I™m not going to go into 
it. And I -- I ra -- I had the rabbi, I  ha -- I 
hired the shul -- a temp le, and he had the mo
st magnificent Bar Mitzvah that ever -- he

54
had ev erything -- at that time, everything was 
Calypso. And a friend of mine was in the 
linen supply business. Everything was serv
ed flambé, and it was kosher, glot kosher, 
because at that time I k n ew a lot of surviv
ors already, and some of them were very 
religious, and I wasn ™t going to  commit a sin. So
 I found a place that was glot kosher, and 
it just opened, the Ventura Club. And -- but 
everything they gave you, they  did your 
flowers, I didn™t like. They  gave me hundr
ed dollar deposit, I paid 500 dollars for 

flowers. Imported hats from Mexico, with ev
erything Calypso, every color. I didn™t like 
his orchestra, so I had another one for the 
grownups. I changed everything around. They  
were supposed to do everything, I did everything. Bu t I lik
ed. But it was a beautiful Bar 
Mitzvah. And, in fact, David was mo stly an 
atheist. But now, as he is getting older, is 
very, very Jewish inclined. And I never pushed
 him, and I never told  him you have to be, 
because when came Christmas, we were at my
 mother-in-laws. Came
 Rosh Hashanah, we 
were at my house. My mother-in-law made
 the be -- on -- on Passover, the best matzo 
balls there is. And I never -- in fact, when my father-in-law had his first heart attack, he -- 

my mother-in-law was running 
up the street to  call us, an d 
she was crossing herself, and 
David was only going one way. 
She star -- sh e called me up, she said -- as sad as it was 
that -- where father is and ev erything, but sa
id, ﬁI have to tell you something. David was 
going one way, and I said, David, why are you 
doing it?ﬂ He said, ﬁAnya, I™m half and 
half.ﬂ You know, so that™s -- that™s the -- 
the funny part that co
mes into a sad life. 
Q: Let me ask yo
u about your -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053
  
 
 
 
55
A: I was very close to them, to
 my mother-in-law, and father-in-law, very close. In fact, I 
had a ex-sister-in-law -- I have a sister-in-la
w that I™m very close to. She™s Catholic, 
because for me it doesn™t ma
tter what religion, what faith
, what race, as long -- and 
especially my mother-in-law and father-in-la
w, David was their life. That was the only 
grandson, and that was their life. And my fa
ther-in-law, he didn™t live to see it, only 
wanted to  live to see David™s Bar Mitzvah. 
My mother-in-law lived  to see it, but my 
father-in-law didn™t. 
Q: Just a quick follow up on your own faith. Yo
u don™t have to go in
to the temple story -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- just a question. Did your faith ch
ange because of your war experience -- 
A: Yes. And I™m not going to lie to you like 
other people. It didn™t change for the better. I 

was -- come from a very religious family. A
nd it™s a town where it was the most famous 
yeshiva, Slabotka Yeshiva. Mo st of the fine
st rabbis came out, and my  grandfather gave a 
lot of money for it. And he was very religious, 
and he was -- like I told you, I was his pet. 
And he was the first one to be taken away. 
With a hundred -- with 
138, I don™t know how 
mu ch it here, but 103 degrees temperature. Th
e first aktja that th
ey had in th e Kovno 
ghetto, th ey took away my  grandfather, my  
grandmother, both of them, but the closest 
one I was to Sh ia and Bessa Schneider. And 
let me tell you -- my 
mother™s family. And 
one time -- my girlfriend died 
of kidney when  she was 38 
years old, for a transplant, 
many, many years ago. And a very famous ra
bbi, Rabbi Newsbaum was at her home, but 
va -- he didn™t go to ma -- many homes, but he
 came to Ethela™s home. And I said, ﬁWhy, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053
  
 
 
 
56
why the nice people die first?ﬂ And he said 
to me, ﬁBecause God doesn™t want them to 
suffer.ﬂ I said, ﬁThat is no excu
se.ﬂ I said, ﬁI h ave never 
done anything, my two little 
sisters have never done anything in their lif
e.ﬂ I said, ﬁWhy did -- one was three years 
old, she didn™t even have a 
chance to -- to suffer, or not to suffer. This is no answer, 
Rabbi.ﬂ Then, when I came to the valley, and 
I was going to have David, I said, ﬁNow 
it™s time to join a temple.ﬂ 
I spent every penny to
 open ing the studio. And Al and Juliet 
West, they helped me out, I 
told you. And I went to a 
very famous temple, I d on™t 
[indecipherable] to tell you, Rabbi Weiss. 
Later on I was with him on the same ticket 
speaking, with the federation, 
and then at -- at the big B™na
i Brith conference. He didn™t 
recognize me when I came to 
the microphone. And I came to him, and I said, ﬁI would 
like to join your temp le.ﬂ And 
he said, ﬁIt cost 750 dollars to 
join the temp le.ﬂ And I said, 
ﬁI can™t afford it,ﬂ [indecipherable] He sa
id, ﬁThen why don™t you look for an other 
temple?ﬂ A nd since then, I would never join 
a temple, and I was with him on one ticket 
that -- that -- at the federation I didn™t say a 
word . But, when  the a liyah start coming in 
from Russia, we had a big convention, B™nai Br
ith convention, and I was there, and it was 
in the aisles microphones, and I came up, and 
I said, ﬁRabbi, you want us to make Jews 
out of the Russian people. They
 are coming so poor, and we 
have to make Jews out of 
them.ﬂ I said, ﬁWasn™t -- do you know me?ﬂ 
He said, ﬁOh yes, Marsha, we were on the 
same ticket at the federation, at the ballroom.ﬂ
 I said, ﬁN ow, don™t you remember in 1957 
I came to you before my  son was 
born, and I wanted to  join yo
ur temp le, and you said to 
me it cost too mu ch  money, I 
should look for another temple
?ﬂ I got such an applaud, 120

57
women were there. Here he™s giving -- this is 
such hypocritical -- he™s giving us a lecture 
that we should help 
the Russian Jews -- being je -- ma
ke them Jews, and -- and -- and -- 
and 20 or 30 years ago he refused me to jo
in his temp le. He™s not the rabbi there any 
more. It™s a very good temple, Temple Ariel. 
Q: Ask you another question. You said ear
lier that you didn™t know th ere were other 
Holocaust survi
vors in -- in -- 
A: No. 

Q: [indecipherable] for awhile
. Wh en -- wh en  did that change, and when  did you -- 
A: I™ll tell you. You™ll die laughing. I was 
sitting in my studio -- sitting in my studio, 

Robert Young was sitting there,
 he knitted on the set. I us
ed mostly designed for the 
Gracie Allen Show. Mostly, it was expensive a
nd -- to have a dress designed by me, or 
they knit it themself or we 
made it for [indecipherable] 
Ice Follies, Mrs. Sheepstead, 
Loretta Young, you know, I had most of 
the studio people. And we™re sitting -- the 
owners of the Sportsman™s Lounge at that time was Zuzu Fine, and Robert Young was 

sitting, and a very old actress 
by the name of Ann Harding, I don™t know if people will 
remember, because at that time sh e was old al
ready. She was on studio
 one or something, 
I saw the night before. And I get a phone 
call. I said, ﬁCan I talk to Mariashki 
Supporzhnikov?ﬂ And I said, ﬁIsh bin my a,
ﬂ this woman is speaking Yiddish, I am 
speaking German because I forgot
 how to speak Yiddish. I said, ﬁIsh  bin Myashka sup,ﬂ -
- I am Myashka Suppozhn. But in German sh
e said, ﬁI™m sorry,ﬂ she said, ﬁMyashka 
Supporzhnikov didn™t speak su
ch a good German.ﬂ I said, ﬁB
ut I am.ﬂ She said no, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053
  
 
 
 
58
she start talking in Jewish, and we talk
 and we talk and the people are there 
[indecipherable]. They are sitting there laughing like crazy for the conversation that™s 
going on, and here I™m sitting th
ere, and -- and talking to her, and she said, ﬁNow wait a 
mo ment. What kind of a coat did you wear in
 ghetto?ﬂ I said, ﬁI wore a gray poodle coat, 
I™ll never forget, with a big, big cub -- .ﬂ 
What do you call it, that you put over your 
head? 

Q: A hood? 

A: A hood. 
Q: A hood, yeah. 
A: Yeah, and it was made out of poodle cloth,
 because when I came 
into the ghetto, I was 
so young, that my clothes grew out of me. So
 my  father found a piece of poodle cloth, 
and he made me a warm coat. And everybody 
envied me, of course. She said, ﬁOh, you 
are really Myashka Suppo
rzhnikov.ﬂ That night I was invite
d to  a very big affair, and I 
stopped off in a home before we -- we went 
to the party, and from then on I start meeting 
more and more survivors. I kn
ew survivors, but I didn™t 
really associate with them, 
because they were from Poland. I had nothing
 did -- I had -- we ha
d nothing in common. 
So I met a lot of Lithuanian surv ivors. And 
this is -- I mean, my
 life was always the 
museum, and always the Holocaust. The first tim
e I start talking was here in the valley. It 
was one time a very big tycoon, the Glickmans. 
He was in the eel -- 
real estate business, 
he was a multi-millionaire, lost a lot of mone
y. He was 13 years old, and he had the 
havara group. Was many, many 
years ago, about 20 years, 
30 years ago. And I went to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053
  
 
 
 
59
their home, and a pr -- a -- a teacher from Gran
t High School at that time, they called it 
the bagel factory, it was a Jewish high sch
ool, and they  were the 
first builders of the 
Stefan Weiss Temple, the Glickmans. And th
ey called me over, they said, ﬁWould you 
talk to havara group, tell them your story?ﬂ 
That was the first time 
I start talking about 
the Holocaust, it was about 32 
years ago. When he brought me home, that professor, from 
-- from Grant High School, he sa
id to Cornelius, ﬁI created 
another billi -- Billy Graham.ﬂ 
From that day on, I start talking about the 
Holocaust to everyone that will listen, and 
never stopped. And what happened is is -- 
but never, never did I tell anybody anything 
that they didn™t want to hear. The only thing that
 is before I went to go to be citizen in -- 
and one of my  clientele was a 
daughter-in-law of Professor J.C. Owens, he was the right 
hand of Hoover. And she said to me, ﬁIf you
 are going to be, be a Republican, not a 

Democrat.ﬂ And Cornelius, and his mother, 
and ev erybody, big De
mocrats. I says -- I 
said, ﬁWhy?ﬂ She said, ﬁI™ll bring you some 
documents, and I want Corn elius and you to  
read it together, because his English is a little
 bit better than yours.
ﬂ I said, ﬁThanks a lot 
Mrs. Owens, you ju st did me a big favor. In fr
ont of all my clientele, you are telling me 
that.ﬂ She took it out of the safe, and sh e br
ought it to me, and I read the story, when  

Hoover was in 1938 in Europe, and he 
came back, and he asked Roosevelt to do 
something about the Jews that 
are being killed in Europe. He 
didn™t come himself to Palo 
Alto, he sent somebody, and to
ld them to inform 
Mr. Hoover that he cannot be bothered 
with a handle -- handful of Jews. And since th
en, I came into a friends of mine house, a 
survivor also from Lithuania, that had a 
big picture of hers 
-- over her fireplace of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053
  
 
 
 
60
Roosevelt, and that was in the 19 -- late 
1950™s, and I spit on his face, and she threw me 
out of her house. And now ev
erything comes out in th e open. Wh at I knew in  ™53, is 
coming out now, with the boat,
 and with ev erything else.  
Q: I have to s -- change. This is the end of ta
pe two, side B, interview with Marsha Loen. 
End of Tape Two, Side B

Beginning Tape Three, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of the United St
ates Holocaust Memori
al Museum interview 
with Marsha Loen. This is tape number three, 
side A. I would like to talk a little bit more 
about your work -- your Holo
caust work  [indecipherable] 
A: My Holo caust
 work is -- 
Q: When does it -- 
A: -- the most important thing in my 
life after my  son and my  husband.  
Q: When  -- when  did that start, and had it some
thing to do also with a 
change in -- in -- in 
society, more of an interest in [in d ecipherable] 

A: No, no, absolutely 
not. When I first started there was 
people didn™t even know th ere 
was a Holocaust. Some Jewish people didn™t know
, like I told you, I ta
lked to the havara 
group, and it was like I was, you know, someth
ing out of the blue. 
They were shocked 
that there was a Holocaust. And these were very close friends of mine.  

Q: And that was in the late 50™s, wasn™t it?  

A: And that was in the -- in the li -- yeah, 
the late 50™s, yes, definitely. And -- no, the 
beginning of the 60™s already. And the people
 were -- were shocked wh at was going on in 
the Holo caust. Jewish people, friends of mine, 
Christian people. It doesn™t matter to me if 
they were Christian, or Jewish, or half and 
half, or whatever it is. So I made up my mind 
then and then, that I™m going -- not -- I was le
ft for revenge, and 
mine only revenge will 
be not to hurt people, but to 
teach them that this
 should never happen again. And th at is 
my revenge, and that why I™m still speaking. An
d that -- we were very rich, we lost a lot 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053
  
 
 
 
62
of money. The same mu seum that I helped 
build , and paid out th
ousand, and thousand, 
and thousands of dollars, I™m working that mu
seum on a salary right now, through the 
federation, at my  age. But I have to, and as 
long as I can drive, and as long as I can work , 
I will do it. Corn elius is still working ag ai
n, too. But I™ll tell you something, maybe it 
makes us happier this way. So metimes I™m ve
ry tired, I could hard ly get done. Because a 
lot of people that work with me
 in the museum, that are in hi
gher positions that I am, are 
very misunderstanding, and don
™t understand the feeling. An
d I™ve talked to somebody at 
the federation th e other week, and he says to
 me, ﬁWe have a big problem here, Marsha.ﬂ 
And he™s right, psychologically, he said, ﬁYou 
are one of the high lite -- lay person, and 
now you™re staff, and that is a big problem.ﬂ 
And he says, ﬁYou can™t stand anything that 

is wrong.ﬂ And I said, ﬁI can™t, because you 
know, wh en I go out, and 
I raise in two days, 
four and a half thousand dollars
 to put up banners, I want to be consulted if the banners 
are alright or not, because three of them 
were made, and it was selected the worst of 
them.ﬂ I said -- and that is what hurts me. 
That person that runs that mu seum, I cannot 
mention name, is very jealous of me, becaus
e when it co mes -- anything that has to do 
with mu seum, everybody knows me, the whol
e community. Starting from the federation, 
to the - to-- to black young ad
ults, African American, to  teachers, to everything else. 
Everybody knows me, and I hope 
they respect me, and that is
 the biggest problem. But I 
have to work , and I -- this is the only job I 
know. And I™ve learned, believe it or not, at 
my age, the last three y ears 
I been working on the compute
r, and I™m pretty good at it. 
Q: Good -- good fo
r you. Good for -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053
  
 
 
 
63
A: And I go out, and you know what? I was su
pposed to start as -- as a coordinator, and I 
was on th e level of higher pos -- not with mo
ney, but on a higher le
vel, and she couldn™t 
take it. So she put me down as eight -- grad
e eight. I got the same salary, and I™m union 
anyway, but she didn™t want to 
have the same paper filled out every two weeks as I did. 
So I was put as, instead of 10 plus to eight
 plus, and it didn™t bother me, because I don™t 
go out for big honor and so on
. I also very mu -- many tim
es met, before I started 
work ing, I went with  Benjamin Meet, and ma
ny other people, to Washington for teacher 
training, to send out teachers to Yad Vashem, 
because I am part of the council of post-
war Jews organization. I am the treasurer fo
r many years. In ™91, we honored Benjamin 
Meet, and Vlodka from the American gathering.
 Benjamin Meet is one of the greatest 
men that I™ve ever met, because he brought th
e survivors together. The first gathering th at 
we went to was in Israel, th
e seco nd one was in Washington. 
In fact, in the Washington 
mu seum, I just got a book from the Washingt
on mu seum, I left it in our mu seum, is you 
open the middle, and there is my  best friend 
from ghetto. When I was 
a little girl he was 
my  boyfriend, Abe Malnik. And it™s a big pict
ures of him, on a -- on a TV screen. I don™t 
know if you™re seen it, the 
last jo -- the last book th at came out. I also am in touch 
constantly with Malsy at the 
book store, because we sell a lot of guides to you, called, 
ﬁThose Who Dared,ﬂ and ﬁRescue.ﬂ That was 
done by the Martyr™s Memorial at that 
time, under the leadership of Alex Grubman. 

Q: I imagine you also did a lot of interviews
 with Holocaust survivors later on. What did 
you -- tell us mo re about that, what
 you learned from that experience. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053
  
 
 
 
64
A: I™ll tell you, I interviewe
d fo r the Shoah Foundation 110 surv ivors, because I needed it 
-- they paid me, and also I wanted to know 
a lot -- you see, I didn™t want to talk about 
things I didn™t know, that you read out of 
a book. And when I arra
nged for the Holocaust 
museum, for the Martyr™s Memori
al, to go out for people to speak, and to  give tours in 
the museum, I™ve alw ays told them, ﬁDon™t sa
y anything that you di
dn™t go through. You 
talk only about your own expe
riences,ﬂ because there was, 
at that time I coached Abe 
Spiegel, and I coached Ed Lasabnik, and I co
ached the first three ch
airs, the lay  chairs. 
And I was the lay person th at coached the -- 
those people. I also was fundraising for 
B™nai Brith in the meantime, fundraising for 
ORT, but I could never take the presidency, 
because always came the museum ahead of it. I 
was -- I was one of the first people, with 
my  husband, with the Carters, and many people 
in the valley, with th
e Katz™s, they were 
older than we are. We raised money to establish the -- 
Q: It™s an airplane coming over here, so -- 
A: Yeah. I -- to establish the Gateway of Ment
al Health, most of the famous hospitals in 
Los Angeles for -- for the Gateway of Health  people. We bought the Hoover lot, and I 
and Cornelius were fundraising.
 I™m very good at fundraising, and especially when I had 
the money, and I gave, I got back  a lot. Even  
now, when  we needed  
banners, I raised the 
money fo r it. I work for the mu seum, but I re
ally work  with my  heart. If you don™t get a 
speaker, I speak. If you don™t -- 
we need to work the comput
er, I work the computer. If 
you need this, I do this. But, th
e only thing that hurts me very 
badly is that the person that 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053
  
 
 
 
65
runs the museum does not like me. Absolu te ly doesn™t understand survivors, and 
absolutely doesn ™t like me. 
But that will change, I ho
pe, in the near future. 
Q: You just said, doesn™t understand su rvi
vors. Let me ask you -- there were so many 
different -- 
A: It was my own fault, Regina, because wh
en the f -- the director left, and he was 
writing a book that is just coming out, called, 
ﬁThe Deniers.ﬂ It will come out in 2000, I 
hope I live to see it. And he didn™t have mu ch
 time. I was working just as coordinator, 
and then when he left, he wrot
e a letter to the head of the fe
deration, that till they find a -- 
a -- a director, I can run the museum, and this
 person can help me. And I did that, and in 

the long run, she got to be th
e director of the mu seum. She doesn™t have a Ph D., she has a 
Master degree, but that™s not important. Sh-S he™s
 very good as a part
 time curator, but not 
as good as a director, and I know I may get fired when  she hears the tape. 
Q: Well, let™s get away from that subject [indecipherable] 
A: Okay . 

Q: -- what I really want  
A: It hurts me very much, this subject. Becau
se the museum has to stay, because I put -- 
this was the first museum built 
in the United States of America. We had breakfast with 
Elie Wiesel. I still have the picture of me
 and Elie Wiesel, and Fred die Diamond. And 
Elie Wiesel at that breakfast, was a very sma
ll breakfast from the federation, said that this 
was a jewel. We were on th e 12
th
 floor of th e Jewish Federation building. And th en we 
start -- they start building th
e Washington museum, and Lydia Bo dka is the president of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053
  
 
 
 
66
the Council of Post-War Jews organization. 
And every year in February -- now I can™t, 
because I work, we went, and 
when I had the money, and we
 helped Latka and Benjamin 
Meet send people all through th e concen trati
on camps, and Yad Vashem -- teachers, to be 
able to teach the Holocaust. When I started to
 -- not lecture, I don™t call it a lectu re -- talk 
about my experiences in
 the Holocaust -- I™m not a lecturer, I™m not a teacher. I -- it was 
done here a little bit, and ther
e a little bit, an d there a little
 bit, and people came by the 
hundreds to the museum when it first opene
d, because for them it was new. I was 10 
days, I™ll show you, from the president of th
e University of Utah, southern Utah. I was 
supposed  to be 48 hours, I st
ayed for 10 days. I set up a Ho
locaust museum 
in the library, 
and the kids were coming down  from the mountai
ns, the Indian kids, a
nd all kind of kids. 
And it was called Jewish week. And there was 
all different kind of illel, did a lot of 
cooking, and dancing, and so on. There was 
one Jewish students in the whole -- at that 
time it was a college, now it™s a university. So 
-- and I paid for everything, and then there 
was a director from Yad Vashem work ing, S
home Balmar, at that time, at our museum, 
and I called, and I saw all those big people 
from Israel, from th
e American Jewish 
committee, and so on. So I -- right away I send 
him a ticket he should come right away to 
Utah. And then he lectured at 
the washing -- at the Einstein hall. So you see, whenever I 
talk, and wh atever I do, I always end up Ho
locaust -- talking about the Holocaust, and 
what it should be done
 about the Holocaust. You know, 
about a couple of weeks ago, I 
couldn™t get speakers. And the museum is sma
ll now, very small, because we are sharing 
till the other building is finished, we are shar
ing the whole first floor
 of a building with 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053
  
 
 
 
67
two other agencies of the federation, with th
e library, and the Jewish Historical Society. 
So, wh en  they have a big group, we divide 
it in three parts. We sen d  them to the 
monument, we have a big monum
ent at Palm Pacific Park, th
at was built by surv ivors, 
and I was on the committee too. In fact, I™m 
engraved in the committ
ee. And we have the 
mu seum, so wh at we do is we divide it in 
three groups. And I coul
dn™t get any speakers 
that day, so I spoke to th ree different groups 
at the same time, the same day. And wo rked .  
Q: I asked -- 
A: So, you can see that 
Holocaust is my life. 
Q: Yeah, so it™s -- 

A: Not th e Holo caust. I™m
 sorry for that expression, the hol
 -- to remember th e Holocaust, 
that this should never happen ag ain. It -- not
 only Jews died in the Ho locaust. I was in a 
death camp, Stutthof, where on the other side
 there were Catholic priests, there were 
Gypsies, there were homosexuals, people -- 
prisoner of wars, people that didn™t agree 
with Hitler, that were killed in that place. St
utthof is the only camp that the original gas 
chamber -- the original cremator
ium is still standing.
 But this is the forgotten death camp. 
I wrote a couple of articles in papers about 
the forgotten death camp , and if you notice, 
when you were here originally
, I made that phone call the minute there is to give out 
money fo r survivors or anything, I call all my 
people that I know, and if they  can™t make 
the phone calls, I do it. We have a guide in 
the museum that we composed for where and 
when  the people should call. For insurance clai
ms, for -- for Swiss m
oney, fo r everything.

If anybody calls -- we send out about at least 
-- at least 800 -- 800 to a thousan d of those 
guides for survivors to do it.  
Q: Marsha, h-how do you feel 
about -- no, let me -- let me say this differently. S-
Surv ivors have so many different life 
stories, and so many different -- 

A: Oh, yes. 
Q: -- experiences. However, is there so
mething from your experience, who has 
interviewed -- interviewed a lot of th
em, too, something that is united -- 
A: The something th at bothers me
 is that a lot of them are a
dding certain things that other 
people went through, that th
ey discussed with. And that 
what bothers me when I was 
interviewing, because I 
read a lot about the 
Holocaust, even for 
the Polish people, and 
Auschwitz, and -- and Majdanek , and ev erythi
ng else. I work ed with, ﬁThe Triumphant 
Spirit,ﬂ with Nick Decalsio on 
the book. And it bothers me 
when people -- like take the 
Hungarians, from Budapest I™m talking about
. They didn™t -- they 
-- they only start 
suffering in 1944, and they were
 put in the ghetto in
 1944. But they al
so suffered, and a 
lot of them were killed in Auschwitz, and ev
erything. But I don™t th
ink they went through 
the things that the  people that went thr
ough -- that went through from 1939. Like, I 
couldn™t say I went through like the Polish 
people that started 19 -- 9 -- ™39, or the 
German Jews. But the German Je
ws, in the beginning, before
 the Kristallnacht still lived 
pretty good. You understand wh at I mean? And like ag ain with th e Anne Frank™s diary. 

You take the Anne Frank™s diary, there™s hundr
eds of people that wrote diaries, but Anne 
Frank™s diary was found first. And I want to
 tell you a story ab out Anne Frank™s diary. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053

My cousin, Leah Salisbury that converted to 
baptism -- I don™t know wh at she converted, 
she married  a guy -- she™s my mother™s cousin , she wasn™t my cousin, she was the literary 
agent to Anne Frank™s diary in -- in America.
 I never had a lot to do with her, because her 
mo ther was Jewish, and she didn™t do it very 
mu ch, she only had to do -- she only had to 
do with show people And sh e wanted me to come
 to her estate in -- 
in Sanvits shwanza, 
somewhere in New York, Connectic
ut, whatever it is -- I don™t 
know what it -- what it is. 
I never went, because I didn™t like it the way 
she treat her mother. It was her mother 80
th
 
birthday, I was a youngster at that time, it was my mother™s aunt. And I went there -- 
Aunt Mo lly, and her biggest pl
easure was modeling, at 80 years old for the temple, and 
things like that. And no, Leah went, was stayed up 10 - 15 minutes, and she left. So when 
she send me tickets when Anne Frank™s diary 
was here, as a theater in Los Angeles, I 
didn™t go. And I don™t really believe in Anne 
Frank™s diary. I believe that it happened, of 
course, it did happen. But there 
is so many diaries been written, there™s so man y  children 
been hidden, there™s so many 
children been killed,
 like my two little sisters, one three 
years old, that was born in ghetto, that doe
sn™t even know what it 
means that little piece 
of bread, one piece of fi -- a whole piece of 
bread, or a whole piece of -- of milk, or 
anything. But she knew every Ge
rman. They were so smart, 
like God has give them mo re 
head, or something. Every German that wa
lked by, she knew by name, when she was 
hidden. You know, because when
 they took away all the child
ren, my  biggest crime my  
mother committed is by 
hiding of my two little sisters. An
d that why sh e was killed at 34 
years old, in Stutthof. I don™t know, like I to
ld you, where she was k
illed. Now that I read 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053
  
 
 
 
70
a lot more about -- when I st
art reading more about Theres
ienstadt, andAuschwitz, and 
everything that was go
ing on, I don™t know where she was killed. 
Q: So you think though that a lot -- many su
rvivors, or at least some who speak about 
their experience, bring in something that
 they have read 
in the meantime -- 
A: That™s right. 
Q: -- or -- or seen on the -- in [indecipherable] 
A: Definitely, and th at why mo st of our sp
eakers of the mu seum can only sp eak about 
their experiences. If they do no
t speak about their experiences,
 they are not called again. 
Because, you know, like I told 
you, some very intelligent men ask me about the Warshaw 
ghetto, and I told him, ﬁI would insult your in
telligence if I tell you,
 because I read the 
same book that you can pick up
 off the shelf, and read it in there in the library.ﬂ 
Q: Do you think that the public
™s perception of survivors has 
changed over the years, that 
the American public looks at survivor
s in a different way than they have? 
A: They look in a much nicer 
way than they  did, because 
the survivors made so mething 
of themself. That why I like th
e survivors to buy, ﬁT he Triumphant Sp irit,ﬂ and see what 
people made of themself. Like, the biggest to
y factory is owned by Mr. Cort. The -- that 
gave a lot of money to the Washington 
mu seum, he gave a lot of money to th e 
monument. He gives, and give
s, and gives, for the Holo caust. Mr. Webb. Most of the 
survivors. Mr. Chappel, here in los -- I can onl
y talk about the people in Los Angeles that 
I know. One of my very, very good friend, was much older th
an I was, he just not long 
ago died, helped build 
the monument in Florida, Abe Re
snick. You mu st have heard of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053
  
 
 
 
71
h im. He co mes fro m Kovn o . He 
was in Kovno ghetto part time
. I k n ew people that -- that 
made so much of themself, the 
survivors, that you have to ha
ve respect for them. You just 
have to. Even if you don™t like what they 
tell you. Even if you feel guilty that you 
couldn™t help them, that you didn™t help them
. You still have to have respect for what 
they made of themself. You ta
ke me, a little girl comes into 
-- married a guy that most of 
the family is Christian, I™m Jewish, ve
ry, very brought up Jewish, come from th e 
concen tration camps, my  husband was in a labor camp . Thanks God my  mo ther-in-law 

was very understanding and help ed a lot of 
Jews, I told you sh e™s a Righteous Christian 
and everything. But still, my brother-in-law 
was in America, having -- living a playboy 
life, you understand what I mean? And so on. 
And here comes that little -- poor little girl, 
you know. And thanks I God -- but I didn™t le
t it happen to me. This is the survivor™s 

spirit. I didn™t let them think of me that he 
is better than I am. No. 
I am the one that is 
feared. I didn™t fear him, he feared me. Y
ou know why? Because I didn™t let him get 
away with it. Because I was 
better than he was. He didn
™t go through what I went 
through, and had to go to scho
ol and ev erything. His father 
paid for everything. I did it 
my self. Do you understand what I am talk
ing about? Maybe peop
le won™t understand 
what I am talking about, but I f
eel very, very  good about it.  
Q: I think it™s very clear. But my question is
 still, so you have really managed to, with 
great determination, and work , a
nd sp irit, to build a new life. 
A: Definitely. 

Q: Still -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053
  
 
 
 
72
A: My life was very rich, thanks God. 
Q: Did th e -- 
A: I went to Europe for a -- for months, and 
month. I was very wealthy at one time, and I 
went to Europe, and I went to
 the first one -- when Hawaii wa
sn™t a state yet, I went to 
Hawaii. I went -- my  friends were very well-
to -do friends, and some of them took us to 
La Jolla, and you know, I went to places wh
ere people -- I don™t say -- you know, my son 
was born a little later, like I told you, I couldn
™t have children, so I had a little more time 
than the other people had. They
 had to bring up their fami ly
. A lot of the survivors were 
lonesome, so they got married
 just with anybody, you unde
rstand what I mean? Maybe 
they -- they didn™t fit, but
 they made a life together, 
they brought up their children 
beautiful. The only thing th at I don™t agree,
 that mo st of the survivor pushed their 
children. And I was -- stood by it, and watched 
it, and it hurts. And a lot of them are sick. 
A lot of them are very sick, and a 
lot of them need
 psychiatrists. 
Q: Did you ever
 need help? 

A: I™ll tell you. Many times 
I™ve need help, but you know
 what? My husband was my  
best psychiatrist. I talk ed a lot of things ov
er with him. And like I said, I told you I™ve 
learned to do self hypnosis, because nobody 
-- I was too strong fo r anybody to hypnotize 
me. And I made a lot of friends. I didn™t ha
ve time -- I d idn™t have -- I lectured on the 
Holo caust, I worked . My studio
 was -- you know, I had contact 
with very unusual people. 
You know, show people are very unusual pe
ople. You know, like Cary Grant ordered 
from me a -- a golf sweater, and he send in hi
s manager to bargain 
with me. And I told 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053
  
 
 
 
73
him, ﬁPlease don™t do this to
 me. He doesn™t want it, let 
him go somewhere else.ﬂ A hand 
knitted golf sweater in cashmere.
 Zsa Zsa Gabor once says to me, ﬁOh, I don™t have to 
pay you the bill, my name is good enough, 
that I come to you.ﬂ I said, ﬁMuch bigger 
people than you are coming to me, and I don™
t mean show people. I mean scien tists. I 
mean other people, just -- just any people. Th
ey don™t have to be 
in show peop -- show 
busin ess to have a brain.ﬂ I didn™t want to tell her that there is no brain, I™m sorry. But 
that™s it. You know, she had lo
oks, and that was important. 
Q: I just -- I just read a quote recently, and I 
just want to give you that quote and see what 
your response is. A scholar recently wrote th
at still in this country  survivors are very 

often seen either way, either as a
nxious ghosts, or as secular saints.  
A: This is full of baloney. I think a survivor
 is a normal person, ab
solutely normal, much 
mo re n o rmal as so me  o f th e Am
ericans I™ve met. And believe me, most of my friends are 
Americans. And like I told you, 
it went by eight years before I met w ith the survivors. 

And I tell you so mething, I had one girlfriend,h-her son -- I didn™t have children yet, and 

her son only ate lamb  chops with
 ketchup. I mean, this is 
abnormal. If my  son would do 
it, I would say he™s crazy. I wouldn™t make
 it lamb  chops a -- and if a daughter, God 
forbid , took a piece of her lamb chops, Ann 
Marie had two problems. I mean, this is 
abnormal. But for s -- for saying
 the survivor are abnormal, no. I feel -- I feel mu ch mo re 
-- much more up to date, and up to life, and 
if I die tomorrow, I ha
ve lived a very rich, 
beautiful life. Poor or rich, 
even if I lost my money -- at one time I w as very depressed 
because I di -- we [indecipherable] twice -- th re
e times, b u t then I ta
lk to myself. I said, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053
  
 
 
 
74
ﬁMarsha, you lo st so mu ch in your life, does those things mean anything to  you?ﬂ After 
the earthquake, when I lost ev
erything. And th en in th e middle of the shakes I went to 
help a friend that lived up in the hills, in 
the dark, with my husb
and, because she was 
there alone. That was more important to me
 than my  Rosenthal, and my  Lalique, and 
everything else. To get into th
e car in the dark, and the shak
es were still going, you know, 
aftershake, to go and help my friend. And 
would any average American do that? And I 
feel my self they would. And that why I ca
ll myself an American. 
I worked for the man 
that I like. I do ev erything that the country need
s, because that country gave me life, gave 
me freedom, gave me  everything. 

Q: Are there things that you are critical of
 in -- in American culture and so ciety? 
A: Yes, to a certain extent about the schools,
 very much so. That why I send my ha --  my 
son in th e beginning to a private school. 
When I went in the public school, it was 
horrible. And there™s a lot of things that -- 
that could be -- when I first came to this 
country it was so peaceful, it was so beautiful 
in 1949. You could walk
 on the streets, you 
could have a ball. And now all this mu rder
ing, and everything that™s going on, it™s -- 
doesn ™t come out of the people, it™s the way th
e people are treated. And if you say, oh a 
black American did it -- I -- I mean A-African 
American did it, or a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- O-
Oriental did it, or this one did it. What 
about the skinheads, wh
at they did to th e 
synagogues in Sacramento? Wh
at about Jewish people that do certain things? And what 
about Christian white people that do certain th
ings? There™s no such a thing, I -- unity is 

the most important thing, and that country 
does not have unity right now. That™s the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053
  
 
 
 
75
problem. And th at why it™s very important that 
the kids in school, or in college, or in the 
university, are learning about unity. That the 
person is flesh and bl
ood. They  are not -- 
even an animal is protected 
by th e animal society, but the 
-- the African American that 
doesn ™t have food is not protected. I know wh
at it means to be wit
hout food. I know what 
it means to be cold. I know thos
e things, so I feel with those 
people. In a country that is 
that rich, and helps everybod
y else. Kosovo, Shmo so vo, ever
ything. Help your country, 
too. I don™t say they shouldn™t help the peop
le. They definitely sh
ould. But help your 
country, too. 
Q: This is the end of tape three, 
side A, interview with Marsha Loen. 
End of Tape Three, Side A 
Beginning Tape Three, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of a United States
 Holocaust Memorial Mu
seum interview with 
Marsha Loen. This is tape number three, side
 B, and Marsha would like to -- to read a 
poem now, but you should probably  intr
oduce it, and say something first. Okay. 
A: Yeah. I was hurt by a friend, so I didn™t kn
ow how to deal with it, so I went home -- 
you know, I™m -- I™m -- 
I™m a amateur poet. I don™t write 
all odays, I just write rhymes. 
So I would like to read you th
e poem. The poem is called, ﬁF
riendship.ﬂ Friendship  is a 
gift from God. The love from a 
second person that draws you like a lightning rod. It takes 
patience, it takes understanding, because if 
you break those rules, 
it cannot easily be 
mended. That is why we go through life to fi
nd a way to understand that person who is a 
friend, and try to keep that fri
endship, and lend a hand. Bu t 
if that person get jealous and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053
  
 
 
 
76
bitter, it is hard to keep you
r cool and ditter. To forgive 
it™s easy, sometimes hard. Who 
knows the right thing, and who is smart? Is th
at person who calls himself my  friend, or is 
that person I do not unde
rstand. The only one who knows is 
me, I feel the love, I feel the 
glee. To be bitter, and to hate is very easy, but
 there is better things in life to keep my 
busy. Hatred hurts only that person who project
s it. That is why I sa
y, forget hate, keep 
your friendship and don™t neglect it. 
Q: So friendship is very important to you? 

A: Yes, very. And if somebody 
hurts me, I just -- I can™t take  it sometimes. So, instead of 
arguing, or doing so mething, I just write a poem,
 or just an article, or anything. What I 
wanted to  tell you is, Regina, that I™m a very
 lucky person th at I™m
 connectedwith the 
Jewish Federation of Greater Los Angeles. Th
ey  gave me a job at a certain age, when 

nobody would have given me a job, wh en I n
eed it. And that™s why I™m very grateful to 
them, and I will be grateful to them the rest
 of my life. A nd that again is the Jewish 
Federation of Greater Los Angeles. 

Q: Did you ever go to -- to es -- to  Israel, 
or to pal -- not to Palestine, to Israel? 
A: I went to Israel. I p ractically ended up 
in Palestine, but -- wh
en  I was smuggling than  
the people, but I went to Israel. The first time 
I was supposed to go to  Israel was in ™67, 
and the war broke out. I was in Russia. I did 
not go to any of the 
concentration camp, I 
never will go. In fact, when I was in Lithua
nia -- that™s why I we
nt -- I did not go to 
Kovno, I stayed in Wilno. Because I won™t gi
ve him the satisfaction, to go to  Po land and 
spend money, to the murderer. It
 went to Kovno -- I went to 
Lithuania, to Russia because 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053
  
 
 
 
77
I had to. There was a reason, there was a missi
on. My sis -- older si ster was the re. And at 
that time I went as a friend, because it was 
still Communistic, and I had to wait two and a 
half years for a visa. And then I had to stay
 in a certain hotel, and everything else. But 
never, never, would I go to Po land, or to a
nywhere where there are concentration camps, 
and have give them the satisf
action to spend money th ere. I™m
 sorry, I won™t do it. I went 
all over Europe. I went to the Mamblon, I went
 to Italy. I know there were concentration 
camps everywhere. There was one in Ebens
ee that I didn™t even know. I was skiing in 
Ebensee with my husband. We
 went there because how fa
r was it from Tronkishin where 
we had the hotel, and we went from -- from -- fro
m Linz, to -- to -- to ve -- I went to -- 
we went on our honeym
oon, we stayed at the Vicearussel 
near the Glosegrog, you know, 
the -- what do you call, the oldest lakes. It
 was in alt -- no, it was in Wolfgangsay.  
Q: Wolfgangsay . 
A: Wolfgangsay. And I went always on trips a
ll through Europe and everything, but still, 
I went to Italy, I went to -- like I told, went
 -- we went to the Mamblon. In ™67, I was 
supposed to -- I went to Russi
a, and th en my husband meet 
me, we were supposed to go 
to Israel, but the war broke out, it was the Si
x Day War, so I couldn™t go there. So I went 
there the year after, and then 
I went for the gathering, and th en I went for the -- went in 
1979. Then I went in 1985, an
d they had the -- for the partis
ans. Then I went again in 
1989. And then wh en  my  ankle broke, it™s very
 hard for me to trav el by plane, so I 
haven™t been  there since. But I have papers, 
I™ll show it to you. I have a beautiful citation 
from the Mengele twins, because I always vi
sit people that were connected with the -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053
  
 
 
 
78
with the Holocaust, and they 
were hurt by the Holo caust, and made friends with them, 
and did something for them that I could. I we
nt -- they were here, I had a symposium for 
them in Los Angeles. I can tell you, I went in Israel, I have -- I found family in Israel, and 
I was very happy. Whenever I went
 there, I was very, very happy. 
Q: Did you feel differently 
Jewish, in a certain way? 
A: No. Abso lutely no. My cous
ins, and my  aunt, they™re not
 Orthodox. They  are Jewish, 
they -- they -- they -- th
ey have their religion, they go to
 temp le, and everything else, they 
have the Passover. In fact, one day I was ther
e on Passover one time, and mo stly I stayed 
in a hotel, I stayed with my co
usin Leah. And my -- my uncle 
died first, then I -- they 
were well-to-do people, they have a -- they ha
d a electric factory, and so on. My cousin 
Leah™s husband had a garage. So  there was no 
problems of any kind, and they  were very 

happy to come here, and I was very happy 
to go to Israel. And most of it was the 
gathering of the survivors in Israel that Be
njamin Meet arranged. I went to Yad Vashem, 
and one year -- see, my mo ther-in-law died
. She was brought out of the Hungarian club 

into Israel, and they  gave a 
big, big deal for her, but sh
e didn™t have time. She was 
honored here in ™68 with some trees in Isr
ael. W-We put in Putnam. I have a big citation 
for her. Like I said, I d on™t take citation all over the place. And then I went -- then I went 

in ™85, and I insisted -- be
cause they knew me in Yad Va
shem arad, and ev -- a-and sh-
show me --  everybody knows me
 -- knew me, and so I say -- I insisted that I want the tree 
already plan ted. So  they went th rough the 
books, and they found it, and the tree was 

planted with two other people from Holland, 
at the same time. And it looks down on th e 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053
  
 
 
 
79
fallen soldiers, from the mountain. I haven™t se
en it since, I™m sorry to tell you th at. But 
one of these days, maybe if we™re still alrig h t,
 and Cornelius is alright, we™ll take a trip 
and go over and see the tree.  
Q: [indecipherable] Yad Vashem in Jerusalem ha
ve a different -- it -- is it -- is it different 

for you th an the othen -- other mu seum
s that you know in  this country? 
A: Yad Vashem is the most im
portant museum, because it was 
first built in jer -- in jer -- 
it™s built in Jerusalem, in ou
r -- you see, everybody has a 
background, except us Jews. 
One comes from Poland, one co
mes from Lithuania, one comes -- but now th ey have a 
country, okay? We always had a co untry, it 
was always the Jewish country, Israel, the 
country of the Jews, but we have a country, 
and in  that country wa
s the first Holocaust 
museum built. And then there is another one,
 the -- I forgot the name of it, it™s in a 
kibbutz. Loch -- Loch  hamma cu
t tahowt. It™s a more partisan
, and so on. I helped with 
that one, too. And Dr. Kulka -- 
I told you, Dr. Harry Kulka 
took me through the museum, 
then he took me to 
the University of Jerusalem. And 
I was from ORT, I -- from the first 
gold pins, I had, and from the first people 
on the -- in Tel Aviv
, I -- University of 
Engineering is our name on it, 
mine and Cornelius™. I -- I don™
t go there very often now, 
and many places. I don™t even fly to Las Vegas 
to my son, he comes here, cause it™s very 
hard on my ankle, it formed ar
thritis. So when I we
nt to Washington, I went on crutches, 
the first time to be taped, not the first time
 to Washington, because
 I was there. I have 
pictures on Washington when it still say be ca
reful, and they just
 had the bottom built, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053
  
 
 
 
80
you know. And then we ha -- I ha
ve the hard hat. Here is a 
little thing there -- right there, 
pick it up, next to the lake is th
e Washington mu seum, right there. 
Q: It™s on this one? 
A: That was given to me, yes. You can read it. 

Q: Well that™s -- that™s a little model with a 
plaque that says, US Holocaust Memorial 
Museum, a campaign to rememb er Marsha Loen, and it shows the mu seum. 

A: Yes, and it™s -- I p u t on -- on -- what is that called, that hard stuff? 

Q: Oh, I™m not very good at that. 
A: Granite, granite. 
Q: Granite. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Oh, it™s real granite? 
A: It™s real granite, yes.  
Q: Very nice. 

A: That was given by -- by af -- to me. 
Q: I™ll put it back a little later. 
A: That™s alright. 

Q: I have, of course, always one mo re question. 
A: Yeah? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053
  
 
 
 
81
Q: Which events in this country , in -- in the 
-- in -- in the USA, in America over the years 
have been really important to you? And they  
don™t have to be nece
ssarily related to the 
Holocaust. Any movement, a
ny event -- political event? 
A: First place, the Fourth 
of July, the independence 
of America, because the 
independence of Israel is very important to me
. So there is a connection, why I love that 
holid ay so much. The second one,
 I can tell y ou th at™s not connected with the -- is the Bill 
of Rights, because everybody is created e
qual. Cause if I don™t think like that, who 
should?  
Q: I don™t think -- 
A: Oh, of course, I like all the holiday. I lik
e the turkey  on Thanks
giving, like I like my 
matzo balls on Passover, my  turkey has to 
be done on Thanksgi
ving. You understand 
what I mean? 
Q: Yeah, I guess I was -- 
A: I™m very traditional. 

Q: I don™t have to ask you wh ether the wome
n™s movement was very meaningful to you, 
because you li -- 
A: No, ab solutely not, absolu
tely not, because I™ll tell you something. It™s important for 
people that the woman sh
ould have a voice. It™s important, 
any person. I don™t care if it™s 
woman, half man, half woman, whatever it is
, should have a voice in
 the country, because 
it™s a demo cratic country. It™s a co untry
 built by -- it™s -- it™s a melting pot. You 
understand what I mean? So  it™s important that
 the mo -- women movement, but an effect

on me, not. What has a tremendous effect 
on me is that the second generation is 
interested in the Holocaust, and especially 
Dr. Gary Shiller, that is
 the president of the 
second generation. I admire hi
m tremendously, and I hope he™s our next chair of the 
mu seu m. 
Q: Why do you -- 
A: Because the second gene
ration should take over.  
Q: You know, that was anothe
r question that I had. Ho w do 
you see the impact of the 
Holo caust survivor testimonies, on the overa
ll Holocaust consciousn
ess memory in this 
country? 

A: I think it™s a good idea. I don™t think it sh
ould be pushed  down  
anybody™s throat, I™m 
sorry. If somebody wants to know 
about the Holocaust, they s
hould be able to -- going in 
-- like in the Washington, the learning cente
r, and push a button, and know what went on. 
If somebody wants to bring their school out to
 the museums, wond 
-- that is th e most 
wonderful thing in the 
world. If somebody -- if you have teacher training like we have in 
the mu seum every year, a teacher training, a
nd we do it with differe
nt agencies, like the 
ADL, the labor committee, the A merican Bureau
 of Jewish Education, we do it together, 

and that is very important. Teacher traini
ng, so the teacher knew, when it comes to 
history, that, like the Spanish In quisition, and th
e Crusaders, this also
 has to be told in 
history, because it happened, 
and it happened to a people, a
nd for no reason at all. And 
it™s good for the people in America to know it, 
because like I said, it™s
 such a melting pot, 
that the people should ge
t along together properly.

Q: What would you say to some of those pe
ople who think that there is now a little too 
mu ch emphasis maybe, on Holo caust education,
 to the detriment of other elements of 
Jewish culture. 
A: I would tell them, like y
ou g -- like the Jews go on Yo m 
Kippur to temp le, and pray. 
That happened 2,000 years ago. This only ha
ppened 50 some odd ye
ars ago, and believe 
me, mu ch , mu ch  mo re 
that happened on Yom Kippur. An
d I think the Yom HaShoah is 
the most important thing, for any religion, or 
any people. It™s importa
nt for us Jews, but a 
lot of people should come and se
e it, and hear it. Because this
 is like going to  temp le on -
- on Yom Kippur. This happened 
2,000 years ago, but it™s stil
l the tradition, and we still 
do it. And people stand in line to get ticke
ts to go to it. But the Yom HaShoah only 
happened 56 years ago, and six million of our pe
ople were killed. And that is -- that is our 

yom -- that is my Yom Kippur. Do you know in
 the beginning, befo re the survivors start 
dying off, I was jealous of a funeral, I told
 you on the tape. Y
ou know. And now, I™m 
afraid to go to funerals. I™m afraid to pi
ck up the telephone, because the survivors are 

going so  fast. And that why the testimony is 
so important, it™s very important, that it 
shouldn™t be forgotten. Look 
at what happened to the Sp
anish In quisition. What do you 
read in the dictionary? A date, a time, what 
happened, and finished with. Are there books 
on it? Not many. And look at 
what happened, and it™s practi
cally forgotten. This will 
never be forgotten, as long as I can help it.

Q: How do you feel about the movies that ha
ve come out, let™s say since the late 70™s, 
where th-the pop -- the popular culture repres
entation of the Holoca
ust is -- how do you 
put it -- 
A: Sometimes it™s overdone, and sometime it™s 
not true. The ﬁSch indler List,ﬂ is the one 
that is the closest, and still it™s
 still a movie. Let™s 
not kid ourself. The best one that I ever 
saw was last month, ﬁThe Shoah,ﬂ becau
se it was interviews. And you see what 
interviews can do.  

Q: In the hands of a master. 
A: Of a master is right. And there™s the -- 
you still see those little pieces of anti-Semitism 
was flying in  the back ground, bu
t people don™t notice it, and -- certain people notice. And 
I think he did the best that ever was, I™m so
rry. Spielberg was alright, I fainted, I went to 
the bathroom. I -- I never fainte
d in my life, but I -- all of 
a sudden I had to run to the 
bathroom and throw up. But I came back -- 
because I was the volu -- Los An gel -- Valley 
Times ask me I should get about three or four
 survivors at the opening of ﬁSch indler™s 
List,ﬂ and then the lady interviewed us, th e reporter, and I did, an d I watched it, and I 

never watched it again. But I did in tervie
w survivors, and I™ve learned a lot from 
survivors by interviewing them, the 110 su rvivors.  
Q: I want to follow up on that, but let me as
k  you, what was the most difficult thing for 
you to watch in the ﬁSch indler™s Listﬂ movie? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053
  
 
 
 
85
A: When they carried those ch ildren on the carts. This is 
when I row -- run out and throw 
up, because I™m sure my little 
sisters was carried somewhere on a cart, or disappeared 
somewhere, somehow. 
Q: And -- and what are -- 

A: The shooting, and ev erything else, I™ve se
en it. I™ve -- I -- I -- I went through it. You 
understand what I mean? You 
have to ask that from an 
American. You understand, 
Regina? But I personally, when the children on 
the cart, when they we
re carrying in that 

camp, this is what I couldn™t take it. 
Q: Are there still some images an d sounds, or 
so -- or memories that
 -- that -- that follow 
you to -- to this day? 
A: Yes. My mother yelling to me, if you su
rviv e, Myashinka, go to  Palestine, and find 
Soatsky. And that was my aunt in Israel, Sa
rah. And also another thing is when  they 
separate me, the man and the wo
man, when they brou
ght us to Stutthof in cattle cars, and 
they separated the man and the women, send 
my father to Dachau
, and my  mother and 
me and the kids to Stutthof, and my  father 
was yelling, ﬁGive us the poison tablets, give 
us the poison tablets. You don™t want that.ﬂ 
And  my  mo th ers said , ﬁN
o. Even if a finger 
is left alive, I am going wher
e the Jewish people are going.ﬂ
 But let that end on a real 
happy thought. I™m an old lady now, I work. Yo
u see we live a pretty normal life, pretty 
American. My accent I couldn™t get rid of, I went
 for speech therapy, I couldn™t get rid of 
it, I™m sorry. And -- 

Q: I like it.

A: Thank you. I don™t, but I can™t help it. An
d you see, I have a s-son, that goes -- you 
heard him go already twice since you are here. 
He lives in Las Vegas, he has his own life 
to live. And he comes -- is comi
ng out now on my  birthday, on th e 28
th
, cause I can not 
drive and fly by plan e. And then , I don™t lik
e Las Vegas, it™s too l -- noisy , and too mu ch  
things. Last time I went to Las Vegas two 
years ago on Thanksgiving, and he had a 
stomachache. We were supposed 
to  go out for Thanksgiving. So
 now I said forget it. If I 
want to play cards, I go to 
one of the casinos, and that™s
 all -- they™re here in Los 
Angeles. I don™t have to go and see those 
-- that they spend thousand -- there™s so many 
thousands of homeless people lying around 
the streets all over America, and they™re 
building millions and milli
ons of dollars hotels in Las Vega
s. Not that we don™t need it, 
we need that too, but there is a limit to 
everything. Yesterday I went shopping. There 
were standing people, and co llect
ing for AIDS, near Juan™s. So 
I sent Cornelius in to get 
canned food for them. And I tried to give as mu ch as I can. When  I had the money, 
everybody got. But now I try to 
give as much as I can. In  f
act, somebody to
ld  me I™ m to o  
generous. Because when I driv
e by in the morning, I drive 
by a bakery that
 has bagels, 
and I had on a -- a -- a department in the fede
ration, they used that I bring them bagels 
and cream cheese in the morni
ng, for the department. So if
 -- if I can -- now we are 
separated, the federation and the museum, a
nd in different places till the building is 
redone. So now I have to wait 
till somebody comes to pick it up,
 or I run over and take it 
over. And this is my  biggest pleasure, even 
if it costs me money,
 that I work, and it 
comes to me very hard. Bu
t this is my pleasure.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053
  
 
 
 
87
Q: I have one mo re question, but let™s stick with pleasures then. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: [indecipherable] what -- what else gives you pleasure? What -- 

A: What gives me pleasure? Li
ke I told you, I had my stud
io, and I did a lot of knitting, 
so I do that a little bit, and it gives me pleasu
re to go to art show, museums. And it give 
me pleasure to -- do you know wh at I like to wa
tch? This is the craziest thing, the classic 

movies, the old movies. Isn™t that ec -- that
 relaxes me. And after reading a Holocaust 

book, or something else, I buy myself a little ro
mance book, to relax me. So I lay down in 
bed, and Co rnelius watches television downstairs,
 and I read that -- and I go from the first 
page, to the middle, to the last page, to know
 what the ending is. And that relaxes me, and 
I fall asleep  with it. 

Q: That™s -- that™s fast r
eading. My  last question actually
 is you mentioned before that 
you learned from the Holocaust survivors a 
lot. Think -- think about a few examples. 
A: An example is that I lear
ned that they are -- some are very, very -- how do you say it -- 
how do -- l -- say -- so me are very depressed,
 and very down, and yo
u have to be around 
them, but it happens very seldom to pick th em up.
 I also learned that when I go to a party, 
they dress like young girls, 70 and 75 year old 
women. They want to stay forever young, 

because they  never had a childhood. And th ey
 never had, really, a young life, because 
they had to work , and bring up a family, a
nd everything else. To 
me , being a designer, it 
hurts my eyes. But I know what they feel
, psychologically. The third thing is what 
bothers me tremendously is that the survivor
 money is handled by Americans. And that 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053
  
 
 
 
88
hurts very badly, because there is a lot of su
rvivors, and needy survi
vors still alive. I get -
- I got a call from a 91 year old woman 
that has nothing to eat. A survivor. 
Q: Because of the so -- it takes -- it takes th
em too long to process it, or that it™s not 
enough -- 
A: No, it™s not enough. What -- what can she 
do, a wo man, she™s 91 years old, she needs 
some help. She needs so
mebody to help her, or be put 
in a home. Or when a survivor 
goes into  a state home, and there is millions
 of dollars in -- in 
New York . A survivor 
should never, after what they
 went through, stay in a state home, should be treated 
completely different. Not becaus
e he™s a survivor, and he™s so
mething special. He should 
have -- his end should be easy on that pers
on, if it™s a ma n or wo man. Maybe I™m wrong, 
maybe I am expecting too mu ch . 

Q: But how -- how -- 
A: Like we™re getting the money from Switzerla
nd, and it™s going on education, it™s going 
on ev erything else. But they don™t reme mb er wh
en they tore my earrings off my ear. And 
my little ring that my grandfather gave me to 
get away. And I didn™t wa
nt to give it, and 
my mother said, ﬁGive it to th
em, give it to them.ﬂ They do
n ™t rememb er wh
en they told 
us if you don™t bring in your goods, plus you
r ironing, plus our electrical appliances. Not 
only the gold, and th e silver, and the plati
num, the electric appliance and everything, 
you™ll be shot. Everybody™s forgotten that. 
And they say that the Jews are greedy, 
because we -- we -- we -- we ask what is be
longing to us, that™s
 co ming to us. They 
haven™t seen nothing from it yet. Not for me
. I need it, too, believe me I do. Driving

every day over the canyon to go 
to wo rk, and then have
 to listen to a lot of things that I -- 
I am very ve -- get very upset, and I come home, and I get sick. Not from the Holocaust, 
that I am to ld, from my superiors. You under
stand? It™s not easy on me, but I needed 
work , and I have to stay. Don™t you think it 
would help  me if I had some money, wh at 
was taken away from me? And -- and I help . 
I am on -- I am on the council, I am the 
treasurer of the council. Today was suppos
ed to be a meeting in my  house, we™re 
honoring a survivor that™s 
going to be 90 years old. We
 honored Latka and Benjamin 
Meet in -- in 1991. We -- we do a lot of vi
enna poldi, fill a page 
for doing ﬁSchindler™s 
List.ﬂ The council is very important, we are in
volved with the money 
to distribute for the 
needy survivors.  
Q: Well, on that note, I think unless you ha
ve something -- I would 
like to complete the 
interview, unless you have something, a last 
word  that you would like to say, otherwise I 
just would like to thank you. 

A: I want to thank the peop
le -- can I know their name? 
Q: Please? Oh, you mean the -- Jeff and Toby Herr. 
A: Yeah. Where is it -- sit -- yeah. I would 
like to thank very much Mr. Jeff an d Toby 
Herr for doing the grant for the interview, or
 whatever they did to get that interview 
going, because that will be a st
ep stone in the museum, and fo
r children to learn about the 
Holo caust. So -- and thank you, Regina, ve
ry much for coming a
nd interviewing me.
