Question: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Interview with Mrs. 
Eugenia Wei ss Greenberg on Ma y 9th, 2013, in Brooklyn, New York. And I would like 

to start by thanking you, Mrs. Greenberg, for agreeing to seeing us today, to telli ng us 

your story, to sharing your experiences with us. I will begin at the beginning, and I would 
like you to tell me your name at birth, when you were born, and where you were born. 
Answer: Eugenia, that's the Italian name; Wei ss, that was m y maiden name; and I was 

born in Abbazia, Italy.  

Q:  Abbazia?               

A:  Abbazia. And it 's on the Adriat ic Coast, right above Trieste. 

Q:  Is it a village or a town?   

A:  It was a resort t own where all the royals of Austria and the Hauptburg Empire used to 
come and spend their holida ys.  It's a real ly beaut iful little town on the Adriatic, and it's 
since become Croati a after World War II.  

Q:  So it's right at that  border?  

A: Right where Tit o, you know, he appropriated that area, and nobody contested him 

because there was a Cold War and whatever, and it's now call ed Opat ija. 

Q:  Opatija?  

A: Opatija. 
Q: So Opatija in Croatian?   

Interview with Eugenia Weiss Greenberg      4 
A:  Yes, and it's right near Fiume. It used t o be Fiume. Now I thi nk it 's called Rijeka or 
something like that, which means ri ver.  

Q:  And when were you born?  Give us your date.  

A:  March 4th, 1932. 
Q:  March 4th, 1932?  
A:  Yes.  

Q:  So you grew up in t he 1930s in this li ttle lovely resort town? 

A:  Right, it was more like an international littl e village because a lot of languages were 

spoken there. 

Q:  What do you remember from your childhood? What l anguages did you hear?  

A:  Well, we had a governess, and she was Croatian, so m y parents t ell me that I learned 
Croatian, and my parents spoke German, so I spoke a little German and Italian. 

Q:  What language did you speak at home with your parents? 

A: We spoke a kind of a German. We didn't speak Yiddish then. 
Q:  Oh, so you spoke German but not Yiddish?  

A:  Yeah.  

Q:  And you didn't speak Italian wi th one anot her? 

A:  Yes, oh, yes, but not with m y parents, with other children; and even though after 1938 
when the sanctions came into exi stence, Jewish children were not  all owed to attend 
school. 

Q:  We'll get to that point.  

A:  Oka y.  

Interview with Eugenia Weiss Greenberg      5 
Q:  Right now, so at home, you spoke German with your parents? 
A:  Yeah.  

Q:  And Italian, Croatian? 
A: Well, wi th m y governess, you know, but I forgot Croatian.  I don't  remember i t, but 
that's, you know, what my parents told me, but with all m y neighbors and children, other 
children, I spoke Italian. We spoke Italian.  

Q:  Did you have brothers and sist ers?  

A:  I have a -- I had a brother who was 14 months younger than I, who unfortunately died 

last year.
 

Q: What was his name? 

A:  
Beno Weiss.
 
Q:  
Beno Weiss?
  
A:  He was a professor, full professor at Penn. State, a really wonderful human being, and 
he would have been so proud to be here today, but he died unfortunat el y last year. 

Q:  
Well, my condolencesfor yourloss.
  
A:  
Thank you. 
 And then after the war, m y parents had two more children.  
Q:  Oh?   

A:  My si sters.  So my brother and I, we were pre-war, and t hey were post-war.  
Q:  And just for right now, give us the names of your sisters.  
A:  My si ster, the older one, they are a year apart, Ruth Weiss Schneider is her name 

now, and Judy Wei ss Gentile. 

Q:  And what years were they born in?  

Interview with Eugenia Weiss Greenberg      6 
A:  One, '45, and '46, right after the war.  
Q:  So you're ten years apart, basical ly, ten, twelve years? 

A:  No, a little more.  

Q:  Yeah.  So what were your parents' names?  
A:  Rachel Weiss and Isaac Weiss, and in Italian, he was known as Isaco, and Rachele.  

Q:  Let's pause just a lit tle bit.  We will let the train go by.  So how is it that you spoke 

German with your parents at home? 
Were th ey n
ative to Abbazia, t he village? Is that how 
I sa y it? 

A:  No, m y parents were born in Poland.  

Q:  Oh. What part of Poland? 

A:  Galicia. 
And m y motherwa
s born in -- no, not Presburg. It will come to me i n a 
second. Can we -- 

Q:  Yeah, we can st op.  We can keep on going, and when it  comes to you, just sa y.  

A:  
My fa
ther was born in Yashanitza {ph
}.
 
Q:  Were these areas part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire? 
A:  Yes, that's why they spoke German, and 
th ey 
-- I think the y were forced to go to 
elementary school, and I think the y probably l earned German, but m y dad ran awa y from 

home when he was 16 because he didn't want to go into the Arm y.  So he was like a real 
traveler, and he lived i n Vienna for five years before going up to Cannes, and t hen he 
traveled down the coast and then ended up in Abbazia, and that 's where he settled and 

married. 

Q:  How did your mother end up here?  

Interview with Eugenia Weiss Greenberg      7 
A:  Well, my father went to visit his parents, i n Migrot, m y mother comes from a town 
called Migrot {ph}. Her father was a shoykhet.  
Q:  What's that?  
A:  A kosher butcher.  And he came to m y father's town. You know, they needed, I 
guess, a shoykhet, and when he was there, he met  m y mom, and then they were engaged 
for five years, and then finall y they got married. 

Q:  Oka y.  

A:  
And m y mothercame toItaly. 
 

Q:  Did she like li ving t here? 

A: Oh, yeah.  The only thing she missed was her parents and her brot hers and si sters. She 

had a large family, but she adapted, you know, quite well, and she had a very good life 
till things started going badly. 
Q:  So talk to us a little bit about t hat life. What was your father's business?  What did he 

do?  

A:  Well, he was a -- he i mported materials.  

Q:  Textiles? 

A:  Textiles, for linens and for clothing, for men's suits, from England and 

Czechoslovakia, and apparently, you know, I think we lived very wel l till things started 
going wrong. 
Q:  Tell me about y
our earliest memories.
  
A:  Goi
ng tothe park with m y mother. 
My father would go to t he cafes every day after he 

did his business, whatever. I remember this hotel called Principe Umberto where the y had 

Interview with Eugenia Weiss Greenberg      8 
dances for children, and swi mming, you know, on the beaches, and my brother and I 
goingdeep inthe water,and my mother
 st anding there and screami ng, and we wouldn't 
listen to her. And t hen poetic justice, my granddaughters did that  to me when the y were 

little. 
So my memories ofm yvery earlychi ldhood
 were very good, except that I 
developed polio when I was about five years old, and I had to spend quite a lot of ti me in 
the hospital in Fiume. It was during the polio epidemic, but -- 

Q:  Do you remember t hat?  

A:  Yeah, I remember that, the treat ments, and being separated from my parents. 

Q:  Well, you were a lit tle girl, yeah, yeah. When you were little, did you  hear anyt hing 
about polit ics? I mean you were a child, but -- 

A:  No, everyone was, you know, sort of enamored with Mussolini; you know, I mean all 
the children wore their uniforms and marched, and I mean as a chil d, I didn't sense 
anyt hing going wrong, but my parents, of course, must have kept a lot  from us. 

Q:  Did you already start school in the '30s?  

A:  No, I never went to school. I never went to elementary school.  

Q:  Oka y.  So tell me a little bit about the larger political context for Italy and the 

town, then how it affected your town, and then how it affected your lives.  What was 

going on i n the late '30s? 
A:  
Well, my father couldn't work
 anymore.  
Q:  
Why?
  
A:  Because of the sanctions that Germany imposed, and then Mussolini followed. 
Q:  Oka y.  

Interview with Eugenia Weiss Greenberg      9 
A:  So Jews were not al lowed to work.  
Q:  And this was from '38? 

A:  I think it started in '38, and we weren't allowed to go to school. There were a lot  of 

limitations imposed on us, but nothing threatening physically. It was all economical; a lot 
of squeezes on my parents. Now, we li ved in t his house called Villa Jaime, and m y 
mother used to go to a park, as I told you, all t he time that  had orchestras and famous 
people coming, and so she would meet people from Austria, and so she connected with 

someone that wanted t o get out of Vienna, and the y lived with us for a whole year.  

Q:  Do you remember t hem?  

A: Yeah, the name i s Hellreich. 
As a mat
ter of fact, he's a dermatologi st in Manhattan 

now, and m y parent s remained good friends with them throughout their lives, and so that 
supplemented and helped pa y for the rent. My mother had to give up, you know, some 
rooms for them, and somehow she sold p ossessions that she had, and somehow we got 

by. We even went back to Poland.My mother took my brother and I to Vienna and 

Presburg because she had family t here. 

Q: 
Presburg,Bratislava, you mean?
 
A: Ma ybe t hat was in '37. I'm not so sure when. 
It must hav
e been before the sanctions. 

Q:  So do you have vague memories of having been on this trip? 
A: Yeah. 
Q:  Oka y. 

A:  Very vague, though. 

Q:  Oka y.  Does anything stand out? 

Interview with Eugenia Weiss Greenberg      10 
A:  I remember the houses.  Apparently, my father's father was the richest man in town. 
He owned the bank
. 
He owned the grocery store.  He owned the onl y brick house in the 
town, and, you know, and some of it was also l ike supplied by my mot her who, you 
know, said that everybody was so glad to see us, and so that was the last ti me 
m y mother
 
saw her parents and sisters and brothers.  

Q:  What happened to them?  

A:  The y were all ki lled. Every one of them.  

Q:  Did she ever find out how and what the details were?  

A:  Well, she found out  that they al l had to dig their own graves, and t hey were shot. And 
m y mother alwa ys felt so guilty because she had a single sister, Esther, and she wanted to 

cometoItaly sobadly, butbecause my grandparentswere heartbrokenwhen my mother 
left, she didn't want to do it to them again, so she did not 
encourage hercoming because
 
she always said if she had only brought her to Italy, she would have been alive ma ybe.  

Q:  That must have wei ghed heavily.  

A:  And one brother ended up in Auschwitz, and he lived till the very end, and then he -- 

I think some kind of accident in the camp killed him. 

Q: Tell me a little bit about the Hellreich fami l y. What -- they came from Vienna? 

A: 
From Vienna.
  
Q:  And why?  
A:  The y were waiti ng for their visa.  The y had family here. He had brothers who 
were willing to sponsor him. 

Q:  "Here" meaning the United States?  

Interview with Eugenia Weiss Greenberg      11 
A: The Uni ted Stat es.  And the y just got out, and, you know, the y lived with us for a 
year, so they must have gone just before the war. Their visa came through.  

Q:  And how many people were there?  

A:  Four. 
Q:  Four people in your house?  
A:  Yeah. 

Q:  So a mother, a father? 
A:  And two children.  

Q: 
Boys, girls?
 
A: A boy and a girl .  

Q: A boy and a girl . And it's t he boy who was the dermatologist? 
A: Yeah.  And the sister, Edith, just died. She had Alzheimer's.  
Q: What is his name? 

A: Freddy, Alfred Hell reich.  

Q: Alfred Hellreich. Did the y tell you stories, your family stories of what was going on in 

Vienna?  

A: Well, t
he y musthavetold my parents. 
I  was a very young child, so these things did 
not penetrate. I just knew sublimi nally, you know, that things were not going so well. 
And we di dn't have that much cash. I remember taking a walk with m y father, where 
before he would like lavish on us, and we wanted a banana, which was quite exotic back 

then,and he took the last of whatever he had, and he bought it for us, and m y brother and 

Interview with Eugenia Weiss Greenberg      12 
I shared it, so I knew that, you know -- and we had, after the Hellrei chs left, we had to 
move because we couldn't afford that big house anymore. 

Q: Did you own t he house, or were you renting it?  

A: No, we rented it.  
Q: And you had a whol e house before?  
A: Well, it was -- it  was a whole floor.  

Q: In a house? 

A: In a house.  

Q: Do you have memories of what it looked li ke? 

A: Well, I went back about three years ago.  

Q: That would have been 2010?  
A: And I found it. 
Q: Really?  

A: I didn't go i nside, but I took pi ctures of the outside because I was born in that house, in 

Villa Jaime. Years ago, you know, you gave bi rth at home. 

Q: Yeah.  How big was it? 
Didit have many 
rooms? 
A: Yeah, apparently it must have if my parents could give up a section. 

Q: Do you remember where you moved t o?  
A: We moved to a much larger buil ding, and we just I think rent ed. We had a room or 
two. 

Q: And how did life change by the time you moved
? 
Was t here more things goi ng on? 

Interview with Eugenia Weiss Greenberg      13 
A: Well, in between I got the poli o.  I know that  I had the polio in the other place, 
not in Villa 
Jaime.
  
Q: Oka y.  So there was a lot of stress in the family? 
A: Yeah.  I mean m y poor parent s, I mean the y were beside themsel ves. Things were 
getting hard economicall y, and thi ngs didn't look good for the Jews, and here they had a 
daughter that had polio, and the y didn't know what my future would be, and so t he y went 

through a l ot. 

Q: Were there many Jews in Abbazia?  

A: Abbazia?  

Q: Abbazia.  

A: I know it had a hotel that had kosher food, and the y had a kosher butcher, but  I really, 
you
 know, couldn't tell  you how many Jews lived in Abbazia, but Fiume had qui te a lot 
of Jews. 
Q: So did your parents, when they socialized, who did the y socialize with?  

A: Oh, the y -- you know, m y father socialized mainly in the hotel Pri ncipe Umberto, that 

he would go to there and he would read the newspaper, he would play chess.  And 

he belonged to a synagogue, so he knew people from there.  And the y had friends in 

Fiume, very good friends with whom the y stayed when t he y would come and vi sit me 
because I was in the hospital there. 
Q: So did they have friends who were Italians or who were non-Jews? 

A: The y probably did because the y were very friendly, outgoing peopl e, so but I, you 

know, neighbors, and 
--
 

Interview with Eugenia Weiss Greenberg      14 
Q: You wouldn't know them?  
A: No. 

Q: What about, did they ever speak Polish with one another? 
A: No.  
Q: Yiddish?  
A: The y probably did speak Yiddi sh to one another, but we kids did not speak Yi ddish. 

 Q: Oka y.  Did the y tell you much about t heir lives in Poland and what it was like when 

they were growing 
--
 
A: The y might have, but I don't -- m y father's tales I knew of because he went off so 

young, and I know he t raveled all over Europe.  He was in Hungary. He was in Austria. 

Then he ended up in France, and he ended up i n Italy, so he really --  
Q: He saw the worl d?  
A: 
Yeah,he moved around.
  

Q: How did things develop further as ti me went on, and how did it affect your family? 

A: Well, we lived li ke t hat till 1940, when Germany declared war, and Mussoli ni went 

along with Hitler. 

Q: Oka y.  

A: And so one night we were all sleeping, t he carabinieris came, and the y just t ook m y 
father away, and I remember, you know, standing at the window screaming, "Papa, 
Papa," and the y took him t o a prison in Fiume where the y kept him for a while, and we 

didn't know what was going to happen. 
They didn't t ake m y mother and mybrother. 
And 

Interview with Eugenia Weiss Greenberg      15 
then eventually the y sent hi m to a concentrati on camp in Fiera Mont e. Have you heard of 
it?  

Q: No.  

A: It's in Calabria. It was one of the camps that they had in Italy for Jews and ot her 
political prisoners, whatever, and then a few days later, they moved us, also, and the y 
sent us to a very small t own near Rome call ed Atessa. 

Q: Atessa?   

A: It has all  kinds of ruins. It's histori cally very old with walls around the town, you 

know, and the y called t hat internment. We were interned.  

Q: What di d it look like? What kind of places did the y put you?  

A: It was a very small l ittle village.  We were not allowed t o go to school.  
We 
were not allowed to leave town.  We had to be in after "Ave Maria," you know, when 

the bells ring in the evening. We had to report to the police station wit h our number to 

make sure that we didn't escape.  We weren't allowed to associate wi th the community, 
but Italians, they di dn't  pay any attention, and we as kids had a lot  of friends. 

Q: Were there more Jews who were brought t o this place?  

A: There were other Jews and some peopl e who ma ybe were alleged to be Communists 

or politically undesirable, and but Mussolini paid us a sti pend, and so we were abl e to 
exist, and he did not go along with Hitler's extermination plan, you know. 
I mean
 he said 
that he would take care of the Jews in Italy.  
Q: Do you think he did? 

Interview with Eugenia Weiss Greenberg      16 
A: Yes, he did in his way by isolat ing us. And then m y mother wrote a letter petiti oning, 
you know, that we wanted to be reunited with my dad, and about a year later, he came to 

Atessa. 

Q: Oka y.  So he was in prison for how long; about a year and a half, two years?  
A: About a year, I would say.  But it wasn't a torture camp. It wasn't an extermination 
camp. It was more a contai nment camp.  

Q: Was it labor? Was it  forced labor there?  
A: No.  

Q: He just had to sta y t here?  

A: He just had to -- 
you
 know, they had no liberties to leave, but t he y weren't harmed. 
And so then m y father joined us. 
Q: What di d he look like? Had he changed in 
his manner?
  
A: My dad, no, because he wasn't harmed in any wa y, except all his rights were taken 
away from hi m. 

Q: Yeah.  

A: And then we lived in this town, Tuscania, for several years. 

Q: Hang on a second.  Before we come to t hat , you mentioned that al l his rights 

were taken awa y. Di d you feel that?  You were a child at the ti me, but did you feel what 
that meant?
 
A: Well, I knew that I couldn't go to school li ke other children did.  
Q: Oka y.  

Interview with Eugenia Weiss Greenberg      17 
A: And m y parents made every effort to get us tutors, you know, because there was some 
English people that  were also interned because they got caught up being in Italy, and so, 

you know, my parents made every sacrifice to, you know, have us become literate, and 

which we did, but we never went to any formal school.  And also the y had to sacrifice 
and sell things in order to, you know, pa y for t utors and our educat ion. 
Q: So his business was simply confiscated way back in Abbazia? 

A: No, he was just  stopped from operating it.  

Q: So it cl osed down? 

A: Yeah, he was prohi bited.  Jews were prohibited to, you know, to work, period. 

Q: By this point you're eight or nine years 
old when yo
u were in t his village; is t hat so? 
A: Yes.  Yeah. '32 -- yeah.  I was eight.   
Q: Were you able to understand more of what was going on around you? 
A: Well, I knew that we had li mitations and that we weren't from that  place, and, you 

know, you become very smart very quickly when you are under stress and your parents 
are being displaced, and but we made the best of it, you know.  We kind of got by. 
And then they sent  us, because we were so dangerous, the y sent us to another town after 

about two years, I think. 

Q: What was the official reason?  
A: Well, the y never gave it to us, you know.  
Q: I see.  Do the y just come and announce it?  

A: The y just said, you know, you have to now go to the Abbruzzi , which is like a 

mountainous region of Italy, and we went t o a town called Atessa.  

Interview with Eugenia Weiss Greenberg      18 
Q: And what was t hat like? 
A: Well, you know, we found nice lodgings in this tiny little vill a out of the way, small 

little rooms. I remember that. It had a garden outside. We started plant ing things. And 

somehow, youknow, we managed. 
 But then i n 1943, when Mussolini was executed 
-- I don't know if you know that story. 
Q: I thought he was executed at the end of the war. 

A: It was i n '43, the end of '43.  

Q: Really? 

A: Yeah.  

Q: Oh, I see.  

A: I think. 
Q: Oka y.  So when he was execut ed? 
A: Yeah, when he was killed and hung upside down over that bridge in Torino, t hen the 

German -- t he Italian government became an ally of the Allied Forces. 

Q: Of the Allied Forces? 

A: Yes, the Italians, and so then t he Germans felt free to invade Italy, and that 's when 

things really became bad for us. 

Q: What happened?  
A: Well, then we had to hide and run because they were hunting Jews, and even t hough 
the Italians, you know, were very good, the y didn't turn you in because there was very 

little anti-Semitism in Ital y. There weren't that  many Jews to hate.  And so then things 

Interview with Eugenia Weiss Greenberg      19 
became, 
you know, quite hectic for us. We had to run and hide, and then the bombing 
started, so we had to protect oursel ves from that. 
Q: How did you --  
excuse me. 
How did you hide?  Would you leave?  
A: We would run, you know, when we would hear, somebody would tell us that the 
Germans were looki ng, we would run into the countryside and look for farmers, and I 
think some of them m y parents must have bribed, you know, and they let us sleep in their 

stalls and whatever. 

Q: And then you would return back to --  

A: Then when we heard that they left, and once the y caught us, the Germans. 

Q: What happened? Tell me in detail. 

A: Well, we were very lucky that he was a humane German S.S. lieutenant, what ever. 
Q: Tell me the circumstances of how you were caught.  
A: Well, we were runni ng, and, you know, they had dogs, and they had guns, and they 
caught us. And m y brot her and I, we started cryi ng, you know, 
"P
lease don't t ake my 
daddy," and "please," you know, we cried, and somehow, you know 
--
 oh, there was a 
German woman also interned because she was married to a Jew from Hamburg. 

Q: So the y caught you and the y took you to Œ  

A: We were running, you know, with thi s other couple. They were stayi ng in a 
neighboring farm, and so she started speaking to the -- she was a glamorous-looking 
blonde -- to this captain, 
lieutenant,whatever hewas, andsomehow by a miracle of 

miracles, the y let us go back, you know, to hiding, whatever.  

Q: 
Inother words, the y 
never brought you to a prison? You were caught on the road? 

Interview with Eugenia Weiss Greenberg      20 
A: Yeah, we were caught running in a countryside. 
Q: I see.  

A: And the funny thing is that my mother tells me that he t old us we can go back home. 

Q: Ok
a y.
  
A: And that the next day, he came with some provisions. 

Q: Really?  

A: Yes.  So I guess there were some humane, you know, Germans, also. 
Q: Was he alone when you were caught, or were there lots of soldiers? 

A: No, he had a lot of soldiers, but he was in command, so, you know, I don't know what 

he told them.  

Q: Because that's unusual. That would sound unusual. 
A: I know. We always talk about how lucky we were that --  
Q: And she said somet hing in German to hi m, do you thi nk? 
A: Well, my parents spoke German, too, you know, so the y spoke to him, and he had pity 

on us, and he just let us all go. 

Q: Wow.  

A: Yeah.  

Q: But frightening for children.  
A: Oh, I never forgot that, how it was, you know, muddy, and how we lost our shoes 
running, and also the Germans had set mines all over the place, so it was very dangerous 

where you weregoing because
 one da y whi le we were running, one of the people running 

in back of us just got killed from a mine. 

Interview with Eugenia Weiss Greenberg      21 
Q: Stepped on it and blown to bit s?  
A: Yes. 

Q: Also very terrifying for a child; I mean terrifying for anybody.  

A: For anybody.  
Q: Anybody, but a chil d at age ten, eleven, and your brot her even younger; do you think 
that that affected you?  

A: Well, you know, al ways people tell me that I'm emotional
ly, you know
, a strong 
person. It kind of hardens you in a wa y. In a way, we were like wise beyond our years 

because my parents would tell us to go and list en to what some of the Germans were 

sayi ng, you know, because --  

Q: You could speak German?  
A: Because we understood what t he y were saying, so I know we did t hat when we were 
quite young.
 

Q: Were there Germans in those villages before Mussoli ni died?  

A: No.  

Q: So Germans only appeared in your lives -- 

A: Appeared after, after.  

Q: 
His murder?
 
A: He didn't let them i nterfere.  

Q: I see. 

A: I mean one thing about hi m, he didn't let t he Jews be sent to concentration camps, and 

he protected his Jews as long as he was ali ve. I mean even though we lost all our 

Interview with Eugenia Weiss Greenberg      22 
freedoms and everyt hing, but that was a compromise, I guess, that we had to live by and 
in a wa y be grateful because we are here, and, you know, we did survive, and then there 

was a whole conflict in that area.  

Q: 
Mm
-hmm.  
A: Because the Germans were there, and the Allies were coming in, and there was like Œ  
Q: So there were bat tles? 

A: Oh, terrible battl es.  We saw people getti ng killed right  out near, looking out the 

window. There was actual war right where we were. 

Q: But give me the name again.  

A: Atessa. 

Q: Atessa. And again, war comes upon you, and you're children? 
A: Yes. Well, the y mined everything. The y destroyed all the bridges, you know, so that 
the Allies couldn't come in easily.  And at this point I developed a very high fever, 

tempe
rature, while we wererunning. 
And we were sta ying in thi s farm house, so the y had 
a hospital t here, so my parents took me to the hospital, and they l et us sta y in the hospi tal, 

and the y had cannons on top of the hospital, even though t he y had a big Red Cross on top 

of it, and we could hear the bombs coming and going, you know. 

Q: So this was the Italians who had those cannons, or whose cannons? 
A: No, the Germans.  
Q: And you were in a hospital where there were German cannons?  

A: Underneath.  And, you know, t he y gave us shelter, and at that point they wer
en't 

looking for us because the y were just fighting and retreating. 

Interview with Eugenia Weiss Greenberg      23 
Q: So my question is this. Two questions. Did you ever feel under -- i nsecure around 
Italians that  you mi ght be betrayed? 

A: No, no, never. They were very brave, or m aybe they didn't  understand th
e 

consequences of their deeds. I don't know which it was. But wherever we went, 
somebody, you know, would give us succor, you know, would give us protection. 
Q: And did you look -- I mean, agai n, woul d it  be easy to recognize you? 

A: No, because, you know, we were running, and m y parents negotiat ed, and we j ust hid 

in this stall. Every now and then the y were kind enough and invit e us to a meal, but, you 

know, most of the time, we just subsisted on whatever we could find.  
So, you 
know, m y broth
er and I said, you know, maybe if we knew who they were, we mi ght go 

looking for them, you know, but it was so transient because we didn't sta y in any place 
for that long because it was dangerous. 
Q: Were you limited by a certain area, though, I mean that you moved from place to 

place, but never very far from where you were before? 

A: Well, we stayed in t he countryside because we thought we were safer there, and also 

ma ybe safer from the bombing and from all the -- 

Q: Where were some of the larger towns so that I'd get  a geographical sense?  

A: Atessa. I really don't know, you know. It's i n the Abbruzzi. 
Q: And while you were in the hospital, and there were the cannons up top, what 
happened? Did the y fire from there? 

A: The y fired from right up our roofs, and they would fire back, and that whole part of 

that hospit al was demolished. 

Interview with Eugenia Weiss Greenberg      24 
Q: So it was not safe at all?  
A: It wasn't safe. So then we ran. Someone tol d us to run to this hotel  in town, and 

practically the whole building fell on us, but, you know, we went to a basement, 

whatever, and, you know, we survived. 
Q: You hid in the basement? 
A: We were just lucky.  

Q: How long did t his go on for? 

A: Seemed like forever, but I guess it wasn't t hat long, but then, you know, the Allies 

came in, and they li berated us. 

Q: Do you remember what the y looked li ke when you saw them? 

A: The y were British. The y were British t roops that liberated that  part of Ital y, mostly 
Indians. 
Q: Oh, really?  

A: Yeah.  The Indians, you know, fought for the British, and the y found us 
a place to 
stay, an apartment t hat, you know, if it was empt y, the y j ust took it temporarily, and one 

of the Indian officers lived with us, and t hen all of a sudden things st arted looking up 

because we had food, and we had protection, and we -- 

Q: And thi s was 1944?  
A: The end of '44.  
Q: Oka y.  
So  
-- 
A: And then in -- and then we went -- we stayed there for a few mont hs, and then we 

were sent to a DP cam p. 

Interview with Eugenia Weiss Greenberg      25 
Q: And where was the DP camp?  
A: The first one was Palazze, which is near Naples, but the y were old Arm y barracks. 

The y were not equipped for winter living. So i t was really pretty there because it was 

near the Mediterranean, and we had a very nice summer, and then when fall came, the y 
sent us to Barletta. 
Q: Where is that?  

A: No, wel l, first when we were liberated -- 
I'm sorry 
-- we went to Palazze.  Then 
they sent us to Santa Maria de Bagno, it was called, in the Apulia section.  And then 

they had confiscated al l these villas of rich Italians who were, you know, using them for 

the summer, and they put all the di splaced people in these villas. 

Q: Were there many di splaced people?  
A: 
Oh, yeah. 
Then all the people st arted comi ng from Poland, from Auschwitz, and that's 
when I learned Yiddish. 
Q: Oh, I see.  

A: Yeah. 

Q: So is that also when you learned, your parents learned, at least, what had happened in 

Poland? 

A: No, the y had heard rumors.  
Q: Oka y.  
A: While t he war was still going on.  

Q: That must have been so heartbreaking.  

Interview with Eugenia Weiss Greenberg      26 
A: Somebody came to our house one da y, I remember that, and told m y mother, and then 
she was hysterical, cryi ng, and somehow, you know, we found out what it was al l about, 

that she was told t hat her whole family was, you know, was killed.  

Q: 
Wh i
ch house would this have been?  
Where
 would thi s have been? 
A: That wa s before, that was before the Mussolini. 
Q: 
Was murdered? 
 
A: 
Was murdered.
 
Q: So that would have been when you were in one of the villages? 

A: Yes, we were in Tuscania.  

Q: You were in Tuscania.  

A:So rumors, you know, traveled. People got mai l or whatever.  I don't know how 
this man found out.  And as a matter of fact, when m y sisters were born after the war, and 
then in the Jewish religion, you are not all owed to name after the li ving, so my parents 
named -- 
the y gavet hem both 
Bi blical names because the y weren't absolutely sure who 
had survived and who didn't because this was all hearsay. 

Q: Well, tel l me thi s, something I meant t o ask and forgot momentarily.  
Were your 
parents very religious? 

A: Well, the y were -- 
came from a v
ery
 reli gious background, but  when we lived in Italy, 
m y dad tried to mai ntai n all the Jewish traditions, you know, Passover, and mainly I 

remember Passover, where he made his own mat zo because we couldn't get that, but 

there was no such thing as having kosher food or, you know, anyt hing like that, but we 

Interview with Eugenia Weiss Greenberg      27 
mai ntained, you
 know, at home. So then we were in the DP camps, several different DP 
camps. Let me see.  One, two --  about four of them for five years. 

Q: 
Why?
  
A: Well, because you needed -- you know, to 
have a visa t o come here.
 
Q: So you didn't want t o stay in Italy, your parents?  

A: Well, we couldn't go back to Abbazia because it wasn't Italy anymore. It was 

Communist Tito. 

Q: And your father didn't --  

A: And we didn't want  to go back to more oppressions, and we didn't  know -- thi ngs were 

not the same. 

Q: Oka y.  
A: So my parents debated whether to go to Israel or -- and then he opted, he said, you 
know, after what we went through, he wanted us to come to a safe place. 

Q: 
So  
--  

A: So we waited.  

Q: 
So  
you were in these various DP camps for 
five years?
  
A: 
Yeah, yeah.
  

Q: Did you go to school?  
A: Well, after the war. 
Q: Oka y.  

A: We took -- m y parents hired again tutors to prepare us t o pass an entrance exam, 

because in It aly, you know, you have to pass entrance exams, each l evel of schooling t hat 

Interview with Eugenia Weiss Greenberg      28 
you go through, and we made it, and then we started middle school, and then from then 
on we went to Genoseo {ph}, and then {undecipherable} for one year, so I had --  which 

is like al most a year of college. 

Q: When you were in t he DP camps, did it feel like internment, or di d it feel like just 
temporary housing? 
A: Yeah, temporary housing, in barracks. We had one room for six people. 

Q: Who was there? 

A: Communal.  My two si sters.  
Q: Oh, the y were born.  

A: My brother and my parents. And we had communal showers and bathrooms, and very 

primitive. The yhad mess
 hall, you know, for people. 
We were
 fed that wa y. And the 
school was very far away, so in one town, my father hired a man with a donkey, and he 

would pick us up every morning and take us to school -- 

Q: A chauffeur.  

A: -- you know, and then pick us up because he started working, and they had li ke a K.P. 

thing in the camp i tself, and he was running it.  

Q: Well, th
at's what my nextquestionis. 
How did your father earn any money that he 
would be able to -- 
A: Well, the y gave us, you know, provisions, cans of food, and we had lodging, and then 
when he started, you know, working in this K.P., he start ed earni ng some money, and 

they, m y parents, sacrificed a lot for our education, hiring math professors, because, you 

Interview with Eugenia Weiss Greenberg      29 
know, we really didn't know anyt hing about math, and but somehow we did well even 
without --  

Q: 
Formal schooli ng?
  
A: -- without having any el ementary educati on.  
Q: That's pretty amazing. 
A: Yeah.  

Q: That's pretty amazing. Were they Œ had t hei r personaliti es been affected? 
A: My parents?  

Q: Yeah, by everything that they had gone through. 

A: Yeah, m y dad was, you know, quite nervous. I'm sure it affected them deeply, but they 

didn't really -- you know, m y father was a very positive-
thinking man. 
 He was 
always grateful, you  know, that we survived and that we were heal thy and that, you 

know, things, when we came here, even though the y struggled, you know, m y dad could 

never 
earn much money,and
 he had to go and learn how to be 
an operator.
  

Q: What ki nd?  

A: Clothing, you know, sewing, because he couldn't find -- he didn't speak the language. 

He spoke a little English. 

Q: So was he a tail or here?  
A: Not a real tailor. I think the y di d piecework, whatever. 
Q: That's tough.  

A: It was very tough for them, yeah.  

Q: Did bot h of them do this? 

Interview with Eugenia Weiss Greenberg      30 
A: Well, then my mother, because she had t wolittle children --  
Q: Of course.  

A: -- and so she couldn't really go to work. And then we came here to join finally an 

uncle in Hoboken.  My father promised hi m that he would never ask him for anythi ng if 
he -- 

Q: 
Sponsored you?
 
A: -- if he brought us over here, and we never did.  And we came in 1950 t o the 

United States. And we stayed for seven weeks in a hotel. The Joint {ph} put us up there, 

and then we went to the {undecipherable}, which is where the  

Shakespeare Theater is now.  

Q: I don't know where that is in New York.  
A: It's on Broadwa y. 
Q: Oh, oka y.  

A: In the vi llage.  

Q: Oh, oka y. 

A: And then they found us an apart ment i n the Bronx, a five-floor walk-up.  

Q: And how big was it ? 

A: It had enough rooms, but the Bronx was turning, and it wasn't such a safe place 
anymore. So m y parent s sent m y sisters to a Yeshiva, a Hebrew 
school,and m y brother 
and I, he was 16 and I was 18, so we went to work, and so we managed.  

Q: That's tough.  

A: Yeah, it was very tough.  

Interview with Eugenia Weiss Greenberg      31 
Q: All that  displacement. 
A: Yeah.  

Q: All that  displacement. So actually you kind of lost home? 

A: Many times.  
Q: Many times.  
Did you 
ever have a feeling of home?  
A: Well, home was where my parents were, you know, and we had a very strong family 
bond.  So because of m y parents, somehow, you know, knowing that we were together 

and we were with them, that gave you a sense of safet y, but we were alwa ys, you know -- 

everything was unpredictable.  We never knew what  would be tomorrow. 

Q: But the one thi ng that was stable was the 
family?
  
A: Was the family.  
Q: That's pretty big.  

A: Yeah. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Well, family is very important.  

Q: How did your life progress here in the states? 

A: Well, I married i n 1952.  
Q: So pretty soon? 
A: Yeah.  
Q: Oka y. 

A: And first I went  to work in a factory. Then I progressed to a clerical job.  And then 

when my daughter was born quite soon after, and so I had three children. 

Interview with Eugenia Weiss Greenberg      32 
Q: Oka y.  
A: And I stayed home.  

Q: When were your chi ldren born?  

A: Well, Debbie was born in '53, and then a son was born in '57. 
Q: What's his name? 
A: Steven. And he died two years ago, yeah.  

Q: My condolences. 

A: And I have another son, Richard, who is going to be 50. 
He's not 50 yet.
 
Q: So he was born in the '60s?  

A: Yeah.  And as soon as the y were a little ol der, I went to college.  
Q: Oh, what college di d you go to?  
A: Brooklyn Coll ege. 
Q: Oka y.  

A: And I did well in school, and t hen I got a master's in school psychology. 

Q: I wanted to ask you about that.  

A: Yeah, and I worked for 27 years as a school  psychologist, and I am now retired. 

Q: Well, tel l me, why did -- how -- or how was psychology something that drew you? 

A: Oh, I d
on't know. 
When I graduated college, I started teaching, and I thought that 
that's what I real ly wanted to do, to teach, but New York City at t hat t ime, you know, it 

was not ideal to teach, especially not middle school. I made a mistake. If I had gone into 

elementary school, probably it would have been better for me because in m y nature, it 

wasn't i n me to be a police person. 

Interview with Eugenia Weiss Greenberg      33 
Q: And mi ddle school you kind of have to?  
A: Thirty percent of the ti me havi ng to di scipl ine kids. 

Q: Yeah.  

A: So I realized very quickly that that wasn't what I wanted to be, and so I said I'll try and 
find something wi thin t he school system t hat gets me out of the classroom, and so -- 
and I 
made the right choice because that was, you know, the ri ght deci sion for me. 

Q: Did psycholo
gy intrigue you?
  
A: I don't know if it was so much that I was int rigued.  I just knew that it would be a good 

job for me. 

Q: Oka y.  

A: Because I like people, and I'm very, you know, sympathetic to other people's plights, 
so and it worked out well. 
Q: 
Wh at
 
is itthat your parents 
-- in the thi ngs that we inherit, we can inherit things, but 
we can also inherit things that are not tangi ble. What are the intangi bl es that your parents 

kind of bequeathed to you? 

A: My parents, you know, I have four sibl ings, and we al l, despi te everything that we 

went through, we all turned out to be resilient, and humanitarian, and upstanding citizens 

with very good moral values, you know, so whatever my parents di d, they did something 
that just worked, you know, and we all turned out to be pretty successful in our own 
pursuits. Everyone in my family is a professi onal, you know, and so m y parents made t he 

right choice coming to this country. 

Q: Tell me how their li ves progressed after they came here. 

Interview with Eugenia Weiss Greenberg      34 
A: Well, when the Bronx turned so badly, m y brother helped them buy a house i n 
Brighton. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: He put down the down pa yment, whatever.  
Q: Brighton Beach? 
A: Yes. 
Brighton, First Street. 
 It was a two-family house because they had two, you 

know, the y had two young children, and t he y didn't want to have to deal with the changes 

that were happening, and the y were very happy with this little house. You know, they 

rented the upstairs, and even though my father didn't make very much, but with t he rent, 

and the y lived frugally, and they di dn't have any excesses, you know, the y somehow 

managed to have a very nice life here. 
Q: 
Werethey happy people?
  
A: 
Yeah, m
y dad was a very happy person. He was very gregarious. He liked to tell 
jokes. He loved people. He became very religious, though, and he went t o a synagogue 
regularly. And he died in 1978. 

Q: 
And your mom?
 
A: My mom died in 1986. She was 93.  

Q: Wow.   
A: Yeah.  
Q: Did they ever talk t o your chil dren aboutŠ  

A: No, not really. My kids interviewed her, you know, for school , different things like 

that, but nothing, nothing formal. 

Interview with Eugenia Weiss Greenberg      35 
Q: And did you, amongst yourselves, the Œ all  the children and your parents, wit hout your 
children involved, did you talk about these thi ngs? 

A: Yeah, m y brother and I did, and especially we went back toget her a few years ago, ten 

years ago. 
Wespent a monthin Florence. 
We had an apartment, and we rented a car, and 
we went back to both Tuscania and Atessa.  And it's really strange, you know, that 

what you remember and what is is not al wa ys the same. 

Q: So how did that show up?  

A: We went  there. We found the places that we lived in. We remembered it, you know, 

between the two of us, we located t he places, and, you know, where I had remembered a 

huge park, it was a tiny little nothing.  The villa that we lived in in Atessa, you know, 

was -- 
Q: Not so big? 
A: Well, it wasn't big.  I don't remember it bei ng big, but we scouted around, and we 

went to places that we remembered. So that was very nice. Now no one knew, 

remembered anything.
 
Q: Oka y.  Oka y. Do you thi nk there were 
any 
-- it 's so transient, so it's almost  like in 
the areas where you were during those years, t here were probably no footprints left of 

what happened, or are t here? 
A: Well, I'm sure that some people do know, but ma ybe, you know, because we were just 
there for two da ys, we couldn't  really do any investigative reporting, you know, and see, 

but we went by where we had to go and gi ve our number every da y, and we went to, you 

know, different sites that we remember, so we did do that.  

Interview with Eugenia Weiss Greenberg      36 
Q: I remember we were looking at a phot ograph of ma ybe it was the same trip or another 
trip when you were there with your daught er? 

A: No, no, that was -- you know, t hat's the -- t hat's a different part of Italy. 
Q: That's where you were originally from, right? 
A: No.  
Q: Where your daughter and --  

A: No, that's Apulia {
ph
}. That's not -- 
Q: Did you ever go back to Abbazi a?  

A: Yes, I went back a few years ago, and that was also a big, you know, blow to my 

memory, but I did find Villa Jaime where I was born, and I did find the park, and t he 

places we went swi mm ing, and Principe Umberto, which I remember as being this huge 
hotel was broken up into different parts.  But the general at mosphere, the pal m trees, and 
the beauty of the little place, you know, remai ns. 

Q: Doesn't mean your memory was wrong; it just means life changed? 

A: Yeah, it just was distorted, and even though it's Croatia, you know, people stil l speak 

Italian there. Many stores still have Italian headi ngs, and so the -- you know, the 
Croatian government now is maki ng it -- you know, is resuscitating t he allure of the 

place.
 
Q: Did your grandchildren express interest in what had gone on with you?  

A: Not that much really. You know, they ask questions every now and then, but they 

never, you know, never explored. But m y brother has some tapes, but, you know, he is 

not here anymore, and he lives 
in Pennsyl vani a.
  

Interview with Eugenia Weiss Greenberg      37 
Q: He lived in Pennsyl vania? 
A: He interviewed my mom before she died.  

Q: Really? 

A: Yeah, I t hink. I don't know if Œ what happened to the t apes.  
Q: Because those could be very interesting to have at the museum. 
A: Yeah, I don't know.  
I'llhave toask my sister
-in-law if she has t hem, or if she 
knows where the y are. 

Q: That could be quite -- that woul d be very, 
very important, you know. 
We would value 

that.  

A: I don't know what, you know, the interview is all about, but when I speak to her next , I 

will ask her if she remembers. 
Q: And for yourself, those formative 
years, when 
-- when you had such an insecure life 
and sometimes a life that could have been easi l y taken awa y, how do you think that that 's 
-- what does it pla y -- when you t hink of your life in total, how big is that portion of it? 

A: Well, it 's at the core of me, you know.  I think it made me who I am. 
It made me 

strong and flexible, and it's something I'll never forget. It's a history that, you know, that 

will be wit h me forever, even though it 's kind of not always there, you know, on the 

outside. 
Q: I think your daughter mentioned to me when she got i n touch with us that you had 
never given your st
ory before. 
You had never told Œ 

Interview with Eugenia Weiss Greenberg      38 
A: No, I mean they know bits and pieces, you know, but it's not something that my 
parents dwelled on, and I think that that's som e kind of a pattern of people who have gone 

through a l ot, that t he y don't really talk about it. 

Q: So were you reluctant to do so?  
A: Well, you know, I mean once I realized the 
i mportanceofit, you know,but it's not 
something thatis spontaneous.
 
Q: Got that. I've got that. Is there something 
--
 excuse me for a second. Is there 
something that I haven't asked about that we haven't di scussed that you think is pertinent  

to all, to our subject today? 

A: Well, you know, I had asked m y daughter, 
because s
he has all the names of the people 
that -- m y uncles and aunts that, that didn't survive, and so many cousins, and that, you 
know, that I think my brother, when he went to Yad Vashem in Israel , I think inscribed 
their names. I'm not so positive. B ut she was at work when I called her this morning, and 

she didn't have it with her. 

Q: So you would want to have those names?  

A: Yes, I would like to add them t o, you know, the victi ms' list if they are not there yet, 

you
 know. I don't know if the museum has them or not.  
Q: I don't know, but when she finds the names, and if the y are sent t o me, I will forward
