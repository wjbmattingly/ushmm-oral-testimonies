't know who t hey are 
but  uh... the  ne xt da y 
we  were told that they are pa rtis
ans.  We  sa w ma ny woods like that
, but finally we came to Durah o  
... t hat 's fi ve  kilome ter from St
alingra d .  We  were  st ationed...

a summer...winter, doing 
wh at?
 
 
A: Wewere eight een
 months  in Russi a.
 
 
Q: Yes , a nd what we re you doing?
 

 
A:  Wh at we  wer e  d oin g
...we ha d a j o b to do... you know ther e 
t he routes, t h e street
s... wasn't pa ve d, 
it was uh...s and. And whene ver a tr
a n sport  pass ed by... `c aus e all da
y long, truc ks , e dge d up t o t he  
to a ...one ma chine a nd t w o  uh...u
h..t wo trail ers wa s hi
t che d up.  You c o uld see eve r y day, passi ng 
to t he  front  but ...ba ck, never  ca me  
back.  But just to the front  a
nd whe ne v er a  tra ns por t pa sse d by, 
our  job wa s t o str aighte n out  the  sa
nd .   I n win t er ti me , we  were  on e 
wi nter  t here, i n wi nt er ti me, we  
had to shovel the sn
ow up the road.  
 
 
Q: I  wo uld i ma gin e th e wo
rst ti me  would have  bee n the muddy
 se ason, I could imagine that the 
roads woul d get muddy a nd..
 
 
A: No, but a ...act ually...a ct
uall y we  had j ust one... 
in the winter time
 we  ha d a r ain.  But we di dn't

Once we  ha d a ra in, right, one  we 
had a rain we couln't eh...couldn't
 get out at all .  But ot her wis e  
wa sn't  so ba d but  at  wi nter  ti me
, when it rained, rain
e d fel l ed ma ybe  t e n,
 fi ft ee n mi nute s  but  
ever ybody wa s sti ff 'ca use  was  - w e  
were iced in -couln't  move.  So
 it wa s so bad, we  hardly... we  
hardl y got bac k to t he  place  wher e we were st
ayi ng.  So anyway, then
 in nineteen uh...uh 
ninet een...uh
 
 
Q:  These corpses, I just
 wanted to get ba ck a little bit, you 
saw almost from the 
beggining that you  
wo uld see these corpses,  these "partisans" as they to

Q: Ukrai ne .
 
 
A: Ukraine. Not in Russi a.
 
 
 
Q: Well at the time 
it was still one country.
 
 
A:  So in ni netee n...uh uh whe n

ere is a winter count er offensive. 
Your  in Rus sia i n t he  wi nter of `41 ...`42?
 
 
A:` 42, but  in 1943 wh
en...whe n t he   Russia n hit  ba ck alrea dy, 
for good - i n April,
 that was in April.
 
 
Q: Yeah, in April and then July.
 
 
A: Uh...from the Stalin
grad, that was the last fi ght,
 that was the last fight in
 Stali ngr ad when t hey hit

A:  No , that wa s Wi nter time...whe

But it was `43 or  was 
`44, it was...forty...
 
 
Q: `42, is when  the Ge
r m ans  rea che d Stali ngr ad...
 
 
A: Yeah, that was fi
ghting back and forth.
 
 

Q: Ri ght, and t hen uh...

Q: Yeah, ear ly. 
 
 
A: No, that wa s...
 
 
Q:  Yea h,  ea rly,  winte r .
 
 
A: No,  th at wa s wi nter ti me .
 
 
Q: Yeah, wi nter 1943.
 
 
A: Yeah, 1943 wi nter  
time when the Russia
ns hit back for good
 
So t hat  was the ti me when all  uh
...al l  the nati ons  who fought ...who
 fought  with the Germans were  
coming bac k  without  wea pon
s.  They were running li
ke crazy.  That  ti me, 
we  runned e ve...da y a nd  
night.  The worst thing 
wa s, t he " kat usha"  -you know - the wea p
on kaytushah.  The Ru ssians did'nt  
have too many kat us ha s, t hey car ri ed t he ket us h
as from one front to the 
ot her .  But one good 
wea pon t hat  the Russia n s did ha ve - an ae oropla ne - 
a whit e aeropl ane, before t hey hit  the tar get s, 
you couldn't hear them, they shut 
the motor, they fl ew 
without the motor.  
Ho w do I know that? 
On e day , we  work ed  o uts id
e where we were livi ng... 
We  di dn't hear  anythi ng..
. then all of a sudden 
"Booom", bombs coming down.  We  
looke d up - we  di d see  
the whit e -  that 's a
ll we  s a w - white , bu t  
no uh...no noises fr
om the engige, no nothing. 
 Just a white thing passi
ng by.  So, th
ose two items : 
the kayt usha and that aeroplane
 - they had t h e most  fear .  
When uh...when anybody uh the 
Russians...no I mean the Germans or  the Hungarians
 or  t he It alian or  t he  
French, who ever heard 
that...uh uh...that ma
c hine, t hat kayt usha -t he y run like cra zy. 
 So that 's what, the , when we head 
bac k, all t he  ti me we he ard t hat  ka tusha .  And we
 came ...we came back to
 all  the wa y...t o uh, t o  
Poland.  An d uh...we wa s stationed 
...uh be fore I do that... Whe n we 
le ft Hungar y t o ....t o Pola nd, we  
wer e four Kommandos, fr
om the same place.  
And three kommandos wa s completely, completely 
wiped out.  They was sent
 to the Russian front, 
uh as...mine sweepers.  
 
 
Q: Human mine sweepers.
 
 

A: Hu ma n  mine s wee pers .
 
 
Q: So i nste a d of doi ng road r epai r

human mine sweepers?
 
 
A:  Our  c o mpan y,  h a d  a  ve
ry good offic er ge ntel ma

elman but we had a couple 
killers in our offi cers.  But the 
high commander in that
 group he said, "as l
ong I am th
e commander 
over here, you people 
will  go home  ali ve."
 
 
Q:  So your  Komma n do wa s 
not  us ed as  mine  s w e epers?
 
 
A: No.  So anywa y, let me go ba
ck, where we wer e already...so ba
ck we came to Poland and we 
came t o a r est place where we 
we re re sting a nd uh...we , all of
 s udde n, we beca me  sic k and  
Flecktyphus [Fleckfieber], you know
 what Flec ktyphus is , 
-t yphus- , t yphus  that wa s from li ce, yo u 
get it fr om lice.  If you 
want to as k me for ...? ??
[2 56] thousands of them.  
So e ver yday, ever y da y,  
wa s dyi ng peopl e on one  si de, t hen 
t h e other  side  -  Ever y mor n ing, I  
me an you get up, 
there's people

stripe s ? / 524 uni for ms .  And uh... 
I wasn't used to this
 treatment because I wa

And, the Ka po - t hat

Q: -the  wor d  "b oss"?
 
 
A:  Yea h...c a me  in [t he kapo] s ays

[ph] 531, you know the Preach, 
that 's whe r e we wer e  sle e pin g, t hey

wasn't used t o that 
ki nd of stuff.  I was  
standing in t he corner, l e aning agai nst it, you kn

Ka po ca me  behi nd me  with a  st ic

Q: But not...
 
 
A: Most of them, they was Jewish.

A: No, no.  So, anyway, ri
ght there, I said to myse
lf, "if I cannot get out of
 here, then I will kill 
mysel f."  - Just like  t hat. Next  da
y, I heard that they taking out 
me chanics...from Aushwi tz.  Sure  
enough, after breakfast th
e Kapo come s in and says  "every me chan

 the gl azers t hey

I ha d uh my fri ends t here  who sai d " A
re  you craz y? " I sai d " n o,... how 
'bout glaziers?" so he says "I  
didn't  a sk? " I  sai d  "no, gla ziers ." 
 So, I we nt in, and sure
 enough in the afternoon
...no next day, third 
day.  Ne xt day, i n t he morni ng, th

Q: Toilet  pa per?  That 's a  luxur y.
 
 
A: I said to myself, "what the heck is that, what 
the hec k is  t his?   The y give us all t h ese goodi es

over to the soldier, to 
the Ger man soldi er and 
 
asked if I can go and get th

 S o,  we  were  fat,  be cau se  we

(end of ta pe  side)
 
 
Q: So you're in the

 to be a locksmith?
 
 
A:  Well, I said "How..
.." - "I wa s living ....clos
e by a locksmith and I saw. ..."
 then a  t hird one  c o me 's  
in.  "What are you?" - "Well, I kn
ow a little bit." So after everything
 was over, the fu hrer [ph] 71 

fr om the...fr om the place comes in to the machine 
shop.  He  sa ys  to me , he  goe s  to me , "Locks mi th, 
come  on."   He  s ays  t o me, " You se
e  t his  door , I want  on t his  door , 
I want a strap, a 
hind strap and in 
the middle with a lock.  The strap 
has to go into the wall.
 O. K? "  Wh at  will  I  
say to him?  "I don't 
know what you're talking ab
out" ?  So I go into the 
shop and I said to the boys,
 " B oys, we have  this  
and this and this to do." Still we 
had enough.  I mean I, 
we had enough.  So we
 started to make the 
fi r e , t he  fi re wa s al so el e c t r i c .   
Not like blowing with yo
ur ha nd.  So I ma ke t h
e fi re fi nally, and put 
a piece of i r on int o  the fi
re, made it hot, and we  st
art t o ha ndl e  it  that  wa y. 
 Make one set, go up, its 
no good.  So what it  di d, 
give  us  an idea of what  we ha d t o do
.  Firs t we chopped 
holes in the wall , 
beca use  it  was uh...bri ck wall s.  
We c hoppe d hol e s on bo
th ends of the jam an
d the n I  meas ure d t o  
the half of the door, 
and tried uh...to bend it...m
ade a hole by the 
bend for the lock 
to go in.  Made 
holes for t he screw to go in
to the  door  and I  go out ...
try it. It worked!  Like 
a mi racle.  Like people  
who doesn't know what to 
do, he did it without any 
common s ense  -  but  by luck
 he  di d it.  So whe n  
I fi nished it , I went  to t h
e uh...offficer who was in 
charge and I said uh.... " 
I fi nished the job."  So 
he come s  out with me , l ook
ed at it, tried it, "Sehr 
gut."  So then he says 
to me , shows me  all the 
doors, t here  wer e a bout f ive doors , 
ha s to be ma de  the  sa me way. - 
We fini shed that , then the place 
was full with machines because
 that was a fa ctory.  It 
was still full of machines...
 
 
Q: Werepeople working

Q: So, it was still an ab

tile factory?
 
 
A: Ye ah, s o he c alls me , he s ays  
to me " I want these machines all 
out , all  t he ma chi nes out of here ."  
I sa ys " Ja wohl".  SO he says  
to me , " How ma ny men you ne ed? "  
 " O h,"  I sai d, "Ten me n."   And 
"How long will it take 
you? " "  Five  days."   O.k., so I  s elect
e d te n pe opl e , we  wer e t h ree, a not he r  
seve n and I  finished 
it i n t hree  da ys .  
 
 
Q: Te n pe ople - t hre e days?
 
 

A:  Thr ee  da ys. I  went  t o ... to t he  o

Q: Mor e  t ha n

A: More than I need.  Bu

I di dn't e at t he whole  thi ng bec ause

"You know what, I'll do 
it for you. I'll fix 
it for you."  So he says, 
"You can do it?" -"Yes!"  So, I said, 
"Don't cook in
 one kessle [kettle], an d 
I 'll  do it for  you."   So, he didn't

chimney and everything and I put it
 back together and

So he  use d t o gi ve  me all sort s of st uff.

Q: You were n't  bri ngi ng food for hi m?
 
 
A:  No, no. Oh no. He  wa s a Kapo

So, anyway, I was ther

then this civil 
ma ster says to me , "You know, we  gonna bu
ild a new place in Sc
hutterecht [can't  be 
found] its  about  five  k
ilometer, five or six k
ilometer fr om this place."
 

 
Q: Sc hutter...?
 
 
A: Schutterecht. 
 
 
Q: And the textile fact

A: Doer nhau
 
 
Q: And you still don't

is textile factory?
 
 
A: No, that wa s our  pla c e.  
 
 
Q: Yeah, tha t 's where  you li ved?
 
 
A: Yeah, that was our place where we lived.
 
 
Q:  So , t h e y  wer e  ma ki
ng some thing at Shuter-
 
 
A: No, that wa s an empty peice of 
pr opert y.  So he s a ys , "  I wa nt 
you  to  co me wit h me  the r e,  w e  
gonna buil d a barr acks."  I said to 
hi m, " What do you want  me ther e 
for?   You s ee - over her e  I ' m 
o.k, I don't know what I'm 
gonna have there."  "Don'
t worry about it - you'll 
be alright."  So, I let 
myself talk into it.  So I'm comi ng there, there's no
 material yet.  Wh at they
 had...they had a...a how 
do you call  it ?  When 
you go camp ing...?
 
 
Q: Te nts?
 
 
A: Ca mping tents .  So he says that
 i t 's just for a c ouple 
days .  I n the mea nti me, the ne xt day - ca me a  
rain.  It rai n ed s o ha rd, t hat in the t e nts, we ha
d two inches of wa
ter.  That was un
bearable.  But, 
they took out people fr om
 there.. we  had uh
...we had about..oh 
three hundred people
 in t hat  place 
without barr acks - just in tent s.  
Wh at they didn't have the material 
there for me to do something so 
in the meantime, there wa
s a railroad station about 
a mile...t wo mi les - a mile away; and they took 

us there to the railroad station 
t o wor k.  We  ha d t o unl oa d c e me n
t  ba gs .  And those  were hundr ed 
kilos  a  ba g, a nd you ha d t o ta ke  t wo bags  at a ti me .  
 
Q: Ea ch pe rs on ha d t o 
car ry t w o hundr ed kilos?
 
 
A:  Two hundred kilos, two 
bags at a time .  Then I cursed this
 guy.  The s e cond da y he shows up, I  
run over t o hi m, I s aid, 
"You son of a s o and s o, 
what  di d you do t o me? "  He  sa ys, " Don't wor r y, 
tommor ow you'll  have  t he ma ter ...
the barracks here."  
And s ure enough, next
 day shows up the 
barra cks .  And he  s ays ,"  Whe n yo
u put up the first one,
 you gonna get  the  firs
t barracks to stay in 
it." Sure enough, we  set up
 one  bar r a c k - here  we  go-  the fi rst  one
 we got into it.  
We  fi ni sh ed  a b o u t  
twelve barracks.  After we
 fi nished the barracks, we
 still... I still have to do 
something.  I don't want 
to go out with the transpor
t, I  mea n wi th t he guys  
to work outside some place.
 
 
Q: How's t he  food he
re.  Not so good?
 
 
A: What not  so good?  Like 
a ny ot her c onc entra tion ca mps .
 
 
Q: No, I  mea n, you lo
st out on the food?
 
 
A:  I l ost  e v erythi ng out .  So a n
yway, what I was lucky 
tha t  I ha d a l rea dy wher e t o  sle ep.  So 
anyway, we  fini shed out  the barracks, so  I went  
over t o hi m and said, " W
hat's now?"  He says,  
"Don't wor r y about it , we  
uh...ha ve  some  pai nti ng to 
do." - I was a pai nter  -.
  Fini shed t he painti ng  
and " What 's  now? " " We ll ", he  sa ys , 
" we  have to build a 
toilet  for t he  people ." Ri ght?   We dug a big  
ditch a nd he  sa ys, " Thi s  ditc h ha s 
to be built up with bricks, the wa
lls shouldn't cave in."  So  I 
became  a brick layer.  So  I fi nished
 t ha t.  I  don't  know how it  c a me  t h
at  it  wa s Wi nter  
time already, I  
we nt i n...I don't why I had t o go 
i n t o a...to t he offi cer 's headqua
rt ers, where the c o mmander li ved. 
And it was cold, it was Wi nter 
time.  I don't know fr om wh ere 
I got the guts to say to the 
commander, " How come it's so cold?"  He says, 
"Because of the wall s, 
t he wall s are  just uh.. uh 
plain boards."  I still uh
...didn't think ove
r that something might.. he co
uld do t o me whatsoever.  I  
says  t o hi m, " How c o me  we can't  
...how come  you not let 
us s top all  the walls? "  He sa ys, "  I woul d 
like to but I don't have the material
."  I says to hi m, " You ha ve pl
ent y of mat erial by t he st ation."  
"Yeah, but I'm not allowed 
t o  do t hat ."  Yea h, s o  I sa ys , " Gi ve  
me  a  sol dier , a nd give  me t wo me n,  
and I will bring you enough materi
al ove r her e. You should have  e n
ough."  "No,no
, no, if they 
catch.."  - What  cat ch?  So he l et  me
 talk hi m into it.  And I got two 
guys  wi th the  sol dier , went  bac k  
and forth br ought  enough ma terial . 
 So, be fore  I  starte d t o do the  
j ob, he  says  t o me , "Re me mbe r  
one thing - its my trade.  Stu
cco, t hat 's my 
trade he  says ."
 
 
Q: This is the commander?
 

 
A: My  commander.
 
 
Q:  He 's  telling you, his vocation...?
 
 
A:   He 's  s ayi ng, " Watc h  yoursel f, 
that's  my  trade."  Do you think 
I  kne w a nyt hing wha t  t o  do?   I...I  
worke d...I  made  the  br ick wor k.  I  kne w ho
w to handle the trow.  
So, I said, "Jawohl." 
 
So I sta r t to mi x the st uc co a nd ev
erything and I start to work.  Fi
r st I put  the boar d
s on it, then I 
start  to work.  He was st andi ng t h
ere, he says "Don't  
rush, don't  r ush."   B
ecause I  was going li ke 
crazy.  Then ar ound ten o'
cl oc k, it  must  ha ve  bee n t en o'cl oc
k, he called.. you know every officer  
had one of t he ha flings . We  were  
cal led ha fli ngs .  They ha d...e very 
offi cer had one of t hos e guys to

 for hi m t hings...like 
 
clean the room.  He call s hi m i n, he says  "inste
a d of one sa ndwi ch, br i

two coffees."  I  di dn't  bother  wi
t h  hi m.  Whe n  he br

c h, t he  t w o coffees , he  
takes away from hi m, gives me  a co
ffee, gi ves  me  a sa ndwi
ch! [ sound of surprise
 ] what 's that?  So, 
I was  sta ndi ng - he says, 
"sit down."  I sat down, 
I fini shed my coffee mit my sa ndwich.  Then, I  
wa nna  go ba ck to wor k, he
 takes out a cigarette.  He
 give s me  a  ci garett e.  The n  he  t ake s a  ci gar ette

[voic e  get s  l oud]  This  i s a  guy 
who ki lled e ver yday a  ma n! .... I  di
dn't know what to
 say.  So, I 
fi nished t he cigarette,  I ran back
 to work.  And uh..by 
the end of the da y,  I'
m c o min g fo

the dinner ...t he people  who give

said, "I am fi nished with the job.
  Do you ha ve a nyt hing els e for

"Don't worry about

`Appell' is?
 
 
Q: Roll  call .
 
 
A: Roll  call .
 
 
Q: Yeah.  So this is

Appell, to the roll call. 
 He knew me, he comes i

"What the heck you doing

Eh, s o a nyway, this ...all t hat we nt

And we did that.  Then, we

That 's the uh

he beat me  up.  
Then, he tells me 
that I  have t o  carr y one  st one  by 
myse lf.  So...whe n t his ha ppe ned..
 
 

Q: This  was  anot her  Je wi sh Kapo?
 
 
A: Yeah. So, when this happ
ened, I said to my friend,
 "If I can't  get  outta here
- then I'll kill myself." 
So, ne xt  morning, next  morni ng 
when we  got up and 
went the Appellplatz, 
I  he ard " Bric kla yers . 
Over here!"   I said to 
my frie nd, " Le t 's go! "  Sta n
ding in the line, the Kapo 
count s off.  He  sa ys, "I  
have t w o pe ople  t oo ma ny. Who ar e  the y?   Wha t  ar
e  you doi ng her e?  [dir ected at  s pea ker ]"   " T he  
ma ster  sel ect ed us  for  bri c k l a yer s."  -  
 
"O.k. [Kapo spea king]."   The y t o
ok us out of there and also in
to the woods.  And what was my  
work there?  There was i n t he mo
unt ains , a hole  for t he  Bunke r .  What
 my  job was...to
 lay the wall 
out wit h st one, ar ound t ha t  it shoul
dn't cave i n.  So, uh, 
he give us two guys 
wh o brought stones and 
mi xed the  uh...t he morta r  and e ver
yt hing.  Wha t  we ha d to do - ta
ke t he stone fr om here a nd put  i t  
on..where i t belongs.  We ha d a bou
t four stones  la yed down by twelve
 o'cl ock.    The master come s 
in, looks  at  it , [a nd sa ys: ]  " We
it er mac hen.  Sehr  Gut!
 We iter m ache n."   -That [me ans ] ` Ver y Good."
 
 
Q: [it means] " Proceed."
 
 
A: Pr ocee d.  And when I  
hear  that ..!  Night come s ...we ra n bac k
 to the Barr ack a t  ni ght  and as we 
mar ch, I see  people  bri nging wood
, wood i nto t he  Barr ack.  I  a ske d 
the guy, "What's that?  What 's 
that for? "  He sa ys , " We  bring wood
 for t he La ger  Fuhrer . He  gives  us  
soup for it ."  Oo
h, so the next  
day, we  st art  to do the 
same thing.  We  getted it
 some  wood 
-  and you c ouldn't br
ing it  ope nly, you 
had to hide it under...u
nder what ever you had on.
..on your sel f.  So, thi s wa
y, we  had a portion of 
soup everyday.  Anyway, `bout...I 
think it was about  Ma rch - the Am
erica ns were cl os
e agai n.  So 
they took us again out of there, 
to t he tr ain.  As we are, as th
e  trai n st arts t o go, t he Ame r ica n 
airplanes start to shoot the train.  
But, they knew who was in the trai
n.  They shoot just  the machine..
 
 
Q: The locomo tive.
 
 
A: THe locomo tive.  And we
 we nt out  to the  fiel d.
 
 
Q: So t he y bombe d it  be fore it  c oul d l eave?
 
 
A: Yes , but  t hey di dn't do
 too much da ma ge  be caus e in
 a n hour l ater we  le ft .
 
 
Q: You got on.  Cattle cars again?
 

 
A: Cattl e car s, yes. And we didn'
t go too fa r. M a ybe by ne xt day.
 Next da y we were st opped by a  
station ` cause the st a
tion was completely bombed.  So, fr
om there on, we  went by fo ot.  
 
 
Q: And  wh er e were  y ou?   T his  
station, do you reme mb er where?
 
 
A: Noo .  S o me wh ere i n Ger ma ny .   S o a n wya y, 
we marched like I said 
befo re to you, it was 
about...over two thousand
 people  wa s i n t hat  ma rch.  And 
wherever  we came int o a wood, t w o 
hundre d fi fty pe opl e we nt , t hey
 s hot  to de ath.  So, fina
lly we came in
to a town...
 
 
Q: Di d you s ee t his pe opl e get 
s hot  t o deat h or you just...?
 
 
A: No, but uh..
 
 
Q: They mar che d a wa y a ndthe n you hear d t he shots?
 
 
A:  Oh  yeah.  Then you never 
sa w them again.  So 
anyway, we  came into a town which was a 
far ming t o wn I  believe
, because it  was a big plac
e and was cows and t hings 
like that and they put  us 
into t hat  bar  agai n and 
uh..no food, no nothing.  
And next mo rning we star
t to march without fo od, 
no water , no nothi ng. And,
 we came t o a fiel d - an 
open fiel d, t o rest.  An
d I remember 
as it  would 
be now..it was still 
grassy, and it wa
s some fl owers.  An
d I ate the fl owers - 
from the grass- the  
fl owers I ate .  And, ne xt it ca me 
night and we got  into a town agai
n.  And uh...we had at that  ti me , 
we ha d wome n s oldiers  too.  S.
S. women.  And where we were 
st ayi ng , I sa w a  wag on wit h t w o  
wheels, with a Plat te [a plat for m
 board] on the top. I 
said to my friend, "Y
ou know what?  We c an 
get some  food.  We take
 that wa gon, we t ell t h e 
women soldiers to put th
eir loop sacks on the  
wa gon, we mi ght get some  
food from t he m."  He sa ys
, " Yea h, ok."  So we were standing t o t he la s t, 
we  t oo k  th e wa go n.   We  said  t o  
the  women sol dier s, " Put  your  bags
 on it."   " O h no,no,no!"  -  " Put  
your ba gs on it."  -  So 
they put their bags on it, bu
t we  didn't get nothing fr om 
it.  But at least, we  had 
a little...we were the last on
es in the whole group, -j
ust in case.  Finally, we 
ca me into a town called 
Ne unbur g a m Wal d [Ne unbur g vor m 
Wal d ].  Ne unburg vo
r m Wa ld and... [e
nd of firs t t ape ].
 
 
Q:  So  you are in 
Ne unburg vor m Wal d?
 
 

A: Ne unbur g vor m Wa l d.  
Well, German people, fr om
 the s ec ond st ory build
ing they t hrow pot atos  
and bread.  And the German
 soldiers, don't you think so they shoot up to these peopl e? Not to throw 
the brea d down?
 
 
Q:  So, Ger man civili ans are t hro
wi ng food to 
you pris oner s mar chi ng 
through?   And Ger ma n  
soldiers shooting -
 
 
A: German soldiers 
shoot ing  up to the  Ger ma n peop
le not  to t hr ow the brea d out.
 
 
Q: And what  ki nd of sold
iers were t hese?  S.S.?
 
 
A: S.S. of course.  No w...
 
 
Q: Did they kill an
y of these people?
 
 
A: No.
 
 
Q: So, it was just 
to drive them away
 from the wi ndow?
 
 
A: Ye ah.  That 's right.  Now, me antime, in this
 place , all of a sudde n it beca me  s o dark t hat you  
coul dn't  see  fr om her e t o  there. 
 And in this place
 in time, meanti
me , we we nt into a..uh.. how do 
you call it?  A.. breez e.., no 
not a bre e ze way, you coul d cal l  it a br
ee ze wa y.  Other wi se ,  you go int o 
one door and you come out t o  anothe
r  door . It 's a breeze wa
y, isn't  it?  As we 
go int o t he breeze way 
to get  some  potat os , they give  us  s o
me pot atoe s  there  -  as  we  st andi ng 
in the line, I said to my friend 
(his na me  is  Morris , i n yi ddis h -  M ois he)...
 
 
Q: The one from Lodz?
 
 
A:   Yeah.  I said, "Moish
e, look, over  here we can
 "entla ufe n", over  here  we
 can run away. 'Cause it 
wa s so dark you c oul dn't se e  from
 here to ther e.  As
 soon as I  said t h e 
word, he  wa sn't ther e  
anymore.  He was gone. 
 So, I went  aft er hi m and other wi w e  we
 left the group an
d we went i nto 
a..a..was a place wher e coop
s - chicken coops and hay 
and uh.. i n t he top.  
We went i n and as I ' m 
going in, its dark - you ca

the steps, it wa s wood, 
wa s chopped fo r firewood. 

And s o me how or ot her I  touc he d it 
and it ca ve d.  It ma de noise li ke , we got s o sc a r ed, we ra n 
upstairs into the hay and 
a bout  te n, fift een mi nut es
 later somebody else co
mes in and this person 
who ca me  i n c oul dn't ca tc
h his  bre at h.  You c oul d 
hear his heart pumping an
d we told hi m that if 
"you don't stop what
 you're doing we kill you." 
 So fi nally, he calmed dow
n - and we were hidden.  
Ne xt da y -  ni ght  - we  we nt downst airs ..
 
 
Q: So you ha d hid all da y long?
 
 
A: Ye ah, all  day long
.  Next night, we  we nt downs t airs a n
d we found t he ke ssle 
where they cooked 
the.. the potatos for the 
cows, for the porks.  We 
filled ouselves up with
 potatos and we went  
upst airs agai n.  We stayed there;
 we  wer e  th ere t hree da ys.   An
d on the  t hird da y - ni ght- da y, at 
night, we he ard pe opl e t alking Polis
h, talking French and 
uh..some  other langua ges .  We  tal ke d t o  
each other, " What t he heck is t his?  Who are thes
e peopl e?"  SO my fr eind says, "I 'm goi ng t o se e 
wh at's  going on."  I said
 t o hi m, " You crazy!?"  As
 he walks out, a
nd you couldn't see 
but he said in 
Polish, `cause someone wa s 
tal king i n Poli sh, he says , " What 's ha
ppening."  So  he 
says, "You don't 
know?   We 've b
een liberated already t wo days."
 
 
Q:  So you found out a bout t h
e l i ber at i on t wo da ys  later?
 
 
A: Ri ght.  
 
 
Q: Do you re me mber  the day?
 
 
A: That was in April. 
 I don't re me mb er the da

Q:  Wa s it  a  nice  da y?  Di d you s ee t he  sun?
 
 
A: Ye ah, ye ah.  So anywa y, uh..t he
y tol d us we  wer e liberat ed a nd t he n he sa ys , " You know, the  
American soldiers - they 
are staying in this buildi
ng.  Go down and se e what
 they c an help you."  
So, as I 'm going - we  goi ng
 downst air s, I  didn't  ha ve no s hoe s.  
I forgot  to t ell yo
u  wh at  it wa s -  As 
we  ma rchi ng, ri ght , who e ver  c oul dn
't march - they were shot  to de
ath.   As  I was 
pulling the two 
wheeler , the  whe el we nt  on my foot
 and I couldn't walk.  
And I  sai d, "M oishe, th
at's  it.  I am not  
goi ng anypl ace anymore."  He says
, " You will go!"  And t en minute
s l ater, a poor guy couldn't  
wal k a ny more a nd a Ger ma n sol dier  we nt ove r a nd 
shoot  hi m in his  hea d a n
d that was t he end of 

that.  And he was weari n g sandals. 
 My friend Moishe 
run over and took his sand
al off and gi
ve it to 
me .  
 
Q: You di dn't ha ve  a shoe  be fo
re and now you have a sandal?
 
 
A:  No , I have shoes but I 
couldn't wear it  because th
e wa gon r an on my foot. 
So - wit h  the sandal  I  
wa s s a fe.
 
 
Q: So you ha d one  s hoe  a nd one sanda l ?
 
 
A: No, no, I had both 
shoes - both sandals.
 
 
Q: Ok, both sandals.  
So you put  the  s andal on?
 
 
A: So, uh..a s we were mar chi ng, 
li ke I s aid be fore, two hundred an
d fi ft y men were shot  in e ver y 
wal k.  Li ke I showed you the  pic t ur e be fore , 
in Ne unbur g vor m Wal d, 
the two hunderded fi ft y 
people we re  shot  in Ne unbur g 
vor m Wa ld.  Were s hot , t w o hundre
d a nd fi ft y people wer e  shot  
there.  And like I sa
i d before, after t he war, we
 r eported to the Ameri can 
authority and the American 
authorit y put  out notic e t o t he Ge r m
an people to assemble
 there and ther e and there; and t hey took  
them out t o t he pl ace where t wo hundr
ed people were shot -  to dig t h
em out  and to have a real buri a l  
in a cemetary.  Th
at 's  what I ha ve that  pict ure  of.
 
 
Q:  Of the  t w o t housa nd t hat be ga
n the march, how ma
ny survived?   
 
A:  About five hundred.  I don't 
know after we run away - [befor
e] there were still about five  
hundred.  But what happen
ed after we  run away I don't know
.  So uh..from th
ere on, we  were  
staying on this place where we  run away and we
r e li ber at ed.  And I  kne w  whic h wi ndow was  
where they threw to us th
e brea d.  So we went  upstair s t o gi
ve t hanks  tp those 
German people for 
the bread.  There was a woman with 
t wo chi l dre n - her husba n d was i n 
the war.  She says to us, "Do 
you have where t o stay?"  
So we  s ay, " no."  So she says , " Here , 
I'll give you a room 
to sta y."   So, w e  
we nt i nto tha t room..
 
 
Q: You and Moishe?
 
 
A: Yeah.  We went i nto t hat r oom 
and uh...she says," wo
uld you like to take a 
bath?"  So we said, 
"Yes."   So she sa ys, "Here's the ba
tht ub."   And we took a bath.  Fo
od, she didn't have.  But she gi ve  

us something to eat.
  But then after we took 
a bath, we  were very tire
d, we  layed down.  After we 
got re laxed, we we nt t o t he Amer
ican authority and we said that 
we are so-and so a nd so a nd t hat  
we  don't have any fo
od.  Of course, they give 
us  and we  brought  it  i nto
 t h e place wher e we li ve d 
and we gi ve it to t he Ger ma n woma
n.  We s ays , " Her e 's  fo
od. And you c ook us  wh
at ever ther e is."  
And la ter on, was esta bli she d - beca
use all of a sudden t here wer e at 
l east  about fi fty 
of us in that  
place - in that little town
.  So, we  we nt to the American auth
ority again to esta
bl is h the  r e fuge e  
camp.  Ther e was a r e fugge
 ca mp s o  we c oul d ge t food - as  a  
refugee ca mp. So, we were t here  for  
about, oh I wo uld say afte
r t he  war  - a bout t w o mont hs  or  t h ree,
 ma ybe.  Then we..
 we  got up to 
look fo r relatives in th
e concentr ation camps.  
Where  di d we  go?   We  we
nt t o Be rgen  Belse n.  
Bergen Belsen is on the English si
de .  So we  ca me 
to  Ber ge n Bel s en , I fi n d 
my cousin there.  And 
he didn't fi nd nobody but he fo
und hi msel f a girl ther e.  And he
 mar r i ed this girl, he ma de a  
we ddi ng t her e.  -  I  we nt outside to
 organize some  food, liquer and th
i ngs like t hat  and as I 'm comi ng  
wit h all t hese goodi es i nt o the ca
mp - there were Englis
h soldi ers who wer e wa
tchi ng t he ca mp.  As 
I'm coming in with the goodies, 
what do you think the 
English soldiers did?
  They confi scat ed 
ever ythi ng t hat I  had.  Can you i ma gi ne t hat?
 
 
Q:  No  re aso n?
 
 
A:  No reason.  Confi scat ed ever
ythi ng what  I had: sala mi , bre ad, 
and lique r and ever
yt hing what  I  
had.  Because, for  cigaret tes and 
c o ffe e you c oul d get anythi ng you wa
nted after the war.  So now, I 
don't  ha ve a gain for  the we
ddi ng - nothi ng.  So
, wer e t hree  of us  -no- four of us , but  t hat Mois he  
wa s st ayi ng wit h  a girl  a nd thre e of us, we we nt 
back again to the city.  
Again wit h coffee and with 
cigare ttes and c hoc olate s , we organiz ed a gai n.  This
 ti me , we  didn't  go through t he main gate . We  
cut a hole through the fe
nce and that's how we  go
t in.  And we  ma de him 
a  we ddi ng,  a  be auti ful  
we ddi ng.  Then, I  or ga ni zed a ...`bout  thirty people  t o
 go home  - t o  Ro
ma nia .  T hat  ti
me i t was again  
Roma ni a.  So, as  we... I organi

e train and we got a wagon a nd 
ever ythi ng a nd a s we go to Cze chosl ova kia t he tr
ain st ops a n d, what do you

soldiers.  They come  to th
e tr ain, and they want t o 
rape  the girls .  As I know a fe w wor ds  in Russi an,  
so I  don't know, by luck 
or what -  the y we nt a w ay.  I  had w

d Roma nians.  The  
Hungaria ns  wer e from Buda pest , 
I had people fr om Budapest a
nd I ha d pe ople  fr om Roma nia ,  
whi c h  we went ho me .
 
 
Q: So you di d get home?
 
 
A:  Yeah.  So, here I'm

that  for  good mone y.  First  I made 
mysel f  t he boot s that  you sa w i n  
the  pict ure  -  good boot s, and ma ny ot her  thi ngs.  
And in the mo rning, I go
t up, one morni ng a nd I  

heard that this guy was k
illed.  And the next mornin
g - this guy was killed. 
 The third night - that  
guy wa s kill ed.  I  sa id
 to mysel f, " uh uh."
 
 
Q: What happened? We

A: No, the Russians.  
The Russian soldiers.
 
 
Q: The Russian soldiers were killing..?
 
 
A:  Yeah.  They robbed 
and then they
 killed them.
 
 
Q:  Who ever they wanted?
 
 
A:  Yea h.   Matter  o f  fa ct

Then I took off.  I went

also, some body tol d

 So, as I came in to a to

, - they give me  and they
 told me that  for this 
in Budapest you can get a 
lot of money.  So, I we nt

 So, i n Budapest , t hey  
had Aliya h -  you know what Ali yah 
is?  Immigration to Israel.  I la

but  my he art  was n 't  to go to Is rael .

 You didn'tworry about 
the Ger mans?
 
 
A:  We  didn't know nothing about
 the Germans `til afte
r the Hungarians came
 in.  But the only 
thing.. where..where it st
arted, when t he Hungaria
ns c a me i n.. they, uh, uh
..dislocated all the Polish 
Je ws from our neighbor hood
. And that's when it st
arted.  That's the time
 when it  st arted. Yes.
