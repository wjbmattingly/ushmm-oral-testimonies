LENA JURAND 
August 15, 1998 
 
Question: This is the 
United States 
Holocaust Memo rial Museum volunteer 
collection interview with 
Lena Jurand
, conducted by 
Gail Schwartz
 on August 15, 
1998 in 
Wa shington, D.C.
 This is tape number one, side
 A. 
what is your full name? 
Answer: My name is
 Lena Jurand
. 
Q: And your maiden name? 
A: 
Salzburg
. 
Q: Where were you born 
and when were you born? 
A: I was born in the city of 
Przemy
˚
l
 in 1917. 
Q: What day, specifically? 
A: The 13
th
 of September. 
Q: And the town is in 
Poland
? 
A: In
 Poland
. 
Q: In the district of
 Lvov
? 
A: Well, according to the latest arrangements, 
Przemy
˚
l
 is almo st at the border, the 
Polish-Ru ssian border, because 
Lv ov
 has become a Russian city, it™s not Po lish any 
more. But when I lived there,
 it was a town of about 60,000 people, of which 22,000 
were Jewish. I went to a Catholic school. 
My father didn™t want to send me to the 
Hebrew gymn asium because it was co-educa
tional with the boys
. So I went to a 
Catholic school. And I find the arrangements 
that they had were very smart. On 44

girls, we were 20 Jewish. So we had a relig
ion class. We had to leave the class and 
go to  another, we Jewish girls. And we ha
d a rabbi who came and gave us a lesson 
in religion. I liked the prie
st better, he was young and ha
ndsome. We had to  stand up 
at the beginning of our classe
s and listen. Not say it, but li Œ stand in the respect of 
their prayer. And we had to stand up before
 we left for home. That was the only 
thing we had to do. Otherwise, we had ou
r religion class. And we had a few Jewish 
teachers, even though it was a Cat holic sch
ool. We didn™t have nuns. The only Œ the 
only way they could prove that it was a Cat
holic school was that we had the prayer 
in the morning and the prayer in the after
noon, which we didn't  participate in, we 
just stood and listened, and that was all. 
Was a very fine school, and a very fine 
education.  
Q: Let™s talk a little bit 
now about your family. 

A: My family. 

Q: How long Œ how far back 
can you go, of generations 
that lived in that town? 
A: Well, I Œ I know my grandfather, w
ho lived there, and my  gran dmother, who 
later, when she was older and ill, stayed with
 us in our house. My father, as a 16 Œ 
my  grandmother, poor, limping grandmothe
r, who had one leg shorter than the 
other, she was very small, had 11 children, 
of which 10 were boys and one girl. She 
was very happy wh en they took off and went to 
America
. The boys. I know of two

were here, living here in Œ in 
New York, 
but my father came here as a 16 year old 
boy. He was a very handsome boy and he wa
s addicted to the theater, to the Yiddish 
theater. So when he came to
 New York
, besides learning a trade to become a tailor, 
he joined the Yiddish  theater in 
New Yo rk. 
And I grew up on stories of great 
Boris 
Tomach evsky 
and 
Luther Adler
. And he played with a 
young boy by th e name of 
Muni
(ph) 
Weisenthal
, which was pel Œ 
Paul Muni
 later. And I still remember my 
father in
 Poland
, in a Jewish theater, 
where he played King
 L e a r . 
Q: King
 Lear
 in Yiddish? 
A: In Yiddish, absolutely
. But, after staying in 
New York 
City for 11 years in very, 
very poor conditions, he got sick. He had 
TB.
 And at that time 
TB
 was not easil y  
cured as it is now, so he wa
s so frightened that he took
 a boat and went back to 
mama ,
 
to
 Poland. 
He never returned. 
But we lived with 
New York
 times all the 
time and I lived with  the stories of the Yi
ddish theater, and th at was my  dream when  

I was a young girl, to come to
 New York. 
Q: What was your father™s name? 

A: 
Isadore
(ph). I remember him in the Yiddish
 theater, and so was my mother. I 
think they met in th
e Yiddish theater. My father wa
s an extremely handsome man. 
Q: Well, the Œ the picture doesn™t show up on the tape.

A: Yeah, I know. He Œ he did very well in 
his profession, he was very successful, he 
had a good busin ess, and he ha
d workers working for him. 
He specialized in ladies™ 
coats and suits, no dresses, and he used me 
as a model. He would say, put on a coat 
and go fo r a walk. My mo ther helped 
him in the busin ess and he was very 
successful. My father by Œ he 
Œ he used to call himself a Œ 
a Œ a socialist. He be Œ he 
belonged to the Polish socialis
t party. And wh en the Russ
ians cov Œ came into our 
town , I was very concerned about him beca
use he was wealthy, very well known. 
They  didn™t touch him. They  didn™t touch 
him. He closed his busin ess and he was 
sitting home, working there, and he surviv
ed. I was afraid  they will take him to 
Siberia
. And I shouldn™t have been afraid, it 
would have been better had they  Œ had 
they taken him. Well, they 
didn't. When theGe
rmans came in, he became one of the 
Œ you Œ are you familiar with the
 Judenrat
? 
Q: We Œ we Œ we™ll get to that in awhile.  
A: Oh, we gonna get to it, all right. 
Q: Yeah, let™s talk a little b
it about your mother™s family. 
A: My mother™s family. I don™t remember
 my mother™s fam
ily as w ell as my 
father™s. He Œ she had a sister, 
older siste r who lived also in 
Przemy
˚
l
. They all Œ 
who had Œ th ey had th ree children, two boys 
and a girl, they all 
d i ed , m-my  mo th er™s 
sister and her family, they all died. Sh
e also had a brother who wo rked for my

father, he was a tailor and was married and 
had a little boy. They all died. From my 
family, nobody surv ived . I™m the only one
, unfortunately. From my husband™s 
family, his father and mother came to 
Prze my
˚
l 
during the war, we 
got them there. 
We thought we can take better care of 
them. I took them to the train.  
Q: So, what was your mother™s name? 
A: 
Anna
. She was a very, very smart, clever
 woman. She was the one to Œ who 
encouraged me to go into hiding during th e war. 
Q: Well again, we™ll talk about that later. 
A: Yes, we will talk about. 

Q: Did you have any brothers or sisters? 
A: No, I was an only child. 
Q: And how mu ch of your exte
nded family was in the area? 
A: My ex Œ 

Q: Aunts, uncles, cousins? 
A: Well, it was my mother™s 
sist er , that was t h e only one
. From my father™s family, 
mo st of them went to
 America
. 
Q: How religious was your house, yo-you Œ 

A: It was, I would say a st
andard religious home. In ot
her words, my father was a 
president of a shul, oh yes,
 and he used to take me with him where men were 

 
Interv iew with Lena J u ra nd

praying, until I rebelled one da
y and I said I don™t want 
Œ I want to go where women 
are, and to this day it bothers me when I 
sit together with men.
 Bu t my  mo th er was 
less religious. She would be in the store on a 
Friday and she would 
forget to light the 
candles, or couldn™t go home. She would sa
y to  me, go home and light the candles, 
so Father wouldn™t know. He didn't like it. 
He was Œ he was a Œ in his way he was a 
religious man, yes. He Œ he Œ I used to 
love Seders because my  father would come 
home freshly shaven fro
m the barber, smelling of powder
 and Œ and we would sit at 
the table and he would say 
dom
(ph) 
sefredyah
(ph) and instead of doing that, I 
would do this 
[indecipherable] 
always Œ he always smiled 
at me w h en we did that. 
Q: These are the plagues
? 
A: Yes. He was very well known in town. 
My father had Œ my  mo ther was the brain 
of the family, my father was the heart. He 
had a big heart. From the age of 10 to  18, 
I went every summer with my
 father for a whole mont
h of July, to the Polish
 Tatra
 
mountains. There was a resort in that Polish 
Tatra 
mountains on the Œ almost on the 
Czechoslo vakian bord er, where people with  
TB
 would come, first of all because of 
the weather. It was marvelous, it was in 
dema nd. Secondly, they
 had special waters. 
There was one water that was 
specially for people with lu
ng problems, and the water 
was later bottled and sold in pharmacies. 
So we went every year, and he would 
always rent two rooms. I never slept in th
e same room where my father was. I was 

 
Interv iew with Lena J u ra nd  
 
August 15, 1998 
 

 
 
9
not allowed to enter the room where my fath
er slept, he was so afraid that I might 
catch the 
TB
 from him, although he was under doc
tors™ care. A Œ but nevertheless, 
he always rented two rooms with an adjo
ining ba-balcony, and I Œ one was for me, 
and one was for him. And we
 would fight constantly, he and I, constantly. Every 
year at the end of the season when we were
 in those mountains, I would say, I will 
never go with you again. He says, if you 
pay me I wouldn™t go
 with you. Until the 
next year. And the next year, May came, I 
saw his eyes looking at me and he says, 
are you starting to pack? And 
we went. We left Mother in the store, she was 
probably very glad to
 get rid of us. And Œ 
Q: What was the name of the town? 
A: 
Przemy
˚
l. 
Q: No, no, the Œ th-the 
resort in the mountains. 
A: Oh, the resort. That™s hard, 
Szczawnica,
 
s-z-c Œ c-z-a-w-n-i-c-a, Szczawnica
. It 
was a place that was Œ there was no train stat
ion there, there was no bus. So we went 
to the nearest town and we hired a taxi 
and we would go th ere.
 And the reason I am 
telling you this is because I wa
s about 14 years old, I always
 travel with my music, I 
played piano. And my  father
 had very few requirements of
 me, but one of those was 
that he rented always for me, a piano, wh
ere I could go and play an  hour a day, 
practice my  piano. We arrived to the sta
tion, and those Jews 
living th ere knew him, 

 
Interv iew with Lena J u ra nd  
 
August 15, 1998 
 

 
 
10
because he was there year after year afte
r year. So they were waiting for him to 
arrive. And as soon as we arrived, they 
would tell him something, something very 
important, and he wo uld turn to  me and sa
y, do you have your mu sic with you? I 
said, yes, of course I have my music, I al
ways have it. He says, well, there is a Œ a 
family, a mother and father, Jewish family
 and two children and th ey  are very poor 
and they don™t have enough 
food. So I, being a spoiled little
 thing, I said to him, 
Father, I don™t understand, if they are so
 poor, why do they go to a summer resort? 
Which was a logical question. But he was en
raged. He says, you mean to tell me  that 
the Œ only the wealthy can ha
ve good air and good waters
? We have to do so mething 
about it, he decided. He says to me, do you
 have that pink chiffon dress that the 
dressmaker just finished for 
you? I said yes, I have it. He
 looked at my  hair and he 
said, we™ll take you to  the hairdresser and have some very nice curls made. And I 
said, what do you have in mind?
 You™re going to  play th e piano, we™ll give a concert 
and we™ll collect money. I said no, I™m not
 going, I am not prepared to give any 
concert. I was 14 years old. He says, we 
will find a boy who™ll play the fiddle. And 
if they see a girl and a boy playing, w
ho cares whether you pl
aying well or not? 
We™ll collect the money. And here™s exactly 
what he did. He hired a place, he found 
a boy, I played with my  mu
sic because I didn™t memo rize anything, and he, he didn't 

 
Interv iew with Lena J u ra nd  
 
August 15, 1998 
 

 
 
11
care, he collected the money for the people. That was my father, always caring about 
people, a lot. 

Q: You had said that he was politically oriented. 
A: Yes, he was a social Œ he used to sa
y he was a socialist and I would Œ I would 
joke and say, a wealthy socialist.  
Q: So you would desc
ribe your family as being upper class? 
A: Yes, yes, yes, I would describe as be
ing Œ he never mastered the Polish language 
and I felt very embarrassed because of th
at. He Œ he spoke 
English, he spoke 
Yiddish, and they sp oke Yiddish  to each other, but never to me. 

Q: What did you speak to him? 
A: Polish. And I offered him that I would t
each him Polish. He didn't want to. But I 
found later that the 
knowledge of Yiddish was very he
lpful to me. I 
didn™t know I 
knew it. When I came to 
Munich
, 
Germany
, and I taught piano in a 
DP
 camp, I had 
children from all over 
Euro pe
, but they didn™t speak German and they didn™t speak 
Polish. So  I didn't know how to  reach them
. I started with my  broken Yiddish, and 
that™s the way I reached them. That™s the mail. 
Q: What kind of neig hborhood did you live in? 
A: I lived like you would live here, let™s say on 
Connecticut
 Avenue. The main 
street of the city.

Q: Did you live in a ho
use or an apartment? 
A: No, we lived in an apar
tment. And our store and factory was about a half a block 
away from where we lived. 
Q: What was the name of the street? 
A: 
Franciszka

ska. 
Q: Was it a Jewish neighborhood, or a mixed neighborhood? 

A: Well, it Œ it was primarily Jewish, yes. It
 was the downto wn of
 the city. And most 
of the stores were owned by Jewish people, yes, yes. 

Q: And did you Œ 

A: It was a lovely city. We never had a
ny crime, we never had to lock our doors 
when  we went out. When Œ there was one
 taxi standing at the station and if 
somebody to ok that taxi, the whole town  knew
 it. At the same Œ at this Œ at the house 

where we lived, downstairs were three Œ tw
o young ladies. They 
were not so young, 
they were older. Unmarried, who had a Œ a st
ore with sweets; candies and things like 
that. And that was my mother™s favorite st
ore, she Œ there was a chair for her there 
and she would always sit in the evening an
d chat with them. I never had to pay for 
anything. I didn't  need any money. As soon
 as I say who I am, it went on paper and 
my mother later paid fo r it somehow, I don™t know. 

Q: Did you have many
 non-Jewish friends?

13
A: I had Œ I had one Polish gi
rl, non-Jewish. The other one was Jewish. No, I Œ we Œ 
as I said, we were Œ we were 20 girls for a 44 girl class, so there were quite a 
number of Jewish girls, yes. 
Q: How Œ fo r how many grades did 
you go to this Catholic school? 
A: From the first to eight, eight years. 
Q: And then  what di
d you do after that? 
A: After that I started to go to a 
conservato rium, which was Ukrainian, in
 Prze my
˚
l.
 
There Œ it was a very, very funny arrangement because I Œ I didn™t speak Ukrainian, 

but I could understand it. They
 spoke to me in Ukrainian,
 I answered in Polish, and 
we understood each other. 
Q: This is a mu sic school? 
A: Music, yes, where I studied piano, yes. 

Q: Did you notice wh en you were younger, 
even in those eight grad es or in the 
conservatory, any indication of anti-Semitism? 
A: Abso lutely not. Absolutely 
not. In all my  years in that school, I have never heard 
something said against Jews, or against us as
 Jewish girls. As I said, we Œ I had Œ I 
had two Œ three teachers who were Jewish. I 
didn™t feel at all, any anti-Semitism. 
And I think my  hu Œ from what my  husband 
was telling me he felt very comfortable 
in his school too.

Q: What was the name  of the school th
at you went to, the elementary school? 
A: That I went to? 
Q: The Catholic school? 
A: 
Maria Konopeniczka
(ph). That™s a name of a Polish 
[indecipherable]
. 
Q: Now, y-you said that you loved Seders. 
A: Yes. 

Q: Any other favorite holid ay
s that you had growing up? 
A: Oh, Rosh  Hashan ah, Yom Kippur, of course. 

Q: And do you have par
ticular memories of? 
A: Oh yes, oh yes, yes, I reme mb er that
. Well, I used to j
oke because when my  
mo ther Œ mo ther has a pair of very b eautiful diamond earrings, and she Œ that was 

her pride and joy, and she kept it in a safe deposit. When  sh Œ I knew wh en the 

Jewish holid ay is coming because Moth er 
took out her earrings, yes, yes, yes. 
Q: How would you describe
 yourself? Were you a very independen t child? Were 
you Œ 

A: I was totally immersed in my studies. To
tally. I Œ well, of course my father was 
very strict as far as boys are concerned.
 I mean, there was no dating, absolutely 
nothing But I Œ I was a very good scholar in 
school, and I also had to spend a lot of 
time pratic Œ practicing my piano. So I 
didn™t have mu ch time for other things.

Q: Were you interested in sports, or art? 
A: No, no, the only sport my  father allowe
d me was ten n is. He 
did not allowed me g 

Œ to go skating. He was a
fraid that I probably break my  leg, probably. I wasn™t 
particularly Œ but, in 
Przemy
˚
l,
 th e city is divided by a river. A river with very, very 
clean water. And in the summer w e had kind
 of a arrangement. 
They built a wooden 
Œ wo oden  cabanas at the edge of the river. And it was done very smartly, that you 

didn™t feel that you have a proper figur
e and you wanted  to 
have a b Œ wear a 
bathing suit. You could go to th e wo od ca
bana, there were steps there going down  

into the water. You could emerge in the 
water without being seen by anybody. And 
this is how we spend our su
mmers, beautifully. Beautiful river. It was a good life, it 
was a very peaceful life, until the war. 

Q: Yeah. What kind of relationship 
did you have with  your mo ther? 
A: My mother used 
to whack me, until I was 16 years 
old. And she used a coppered 
beater as her favorite object, and I got 
my  beating only for th
e piano lessons. You 
see, I had a notebook. For each piano less
on she would write in the date, what was 
my next assignment and at the bottom 
was a mark from each lesson. If I had a 
A
 or a 
B
, it was all right. If I had a 
C
, I was licked. And yet, she was my  best friend. When  
I grew up, she was my best friend. When 
I got married, it was already 1940. Times 
were starting to be very  bad, I discovere
d th at I™m pregnant, and I went to my  

 
Interv iew with Lena J u ra nd

mother and I said, Mother, I 
am pregnant. She didn™t Œ sh
e didn™t bat an eyelid. She 
said, then we have to  get an abortion. 
She went with me. She got the doctor. In 
Pola nd , 
to get an abortion is like to spit. 
As long you have enough money, no 
problem. She got the women doctor and an
other docto r who was present. She took 
me there. I got an abortion. Sh e says, you 
cannot have a baby now. And if I had that 
baby, I wouldn™t have surviv
ed, that™s for sure. And afte
r that she said to me, you 
can rest for 10 minutes, then we walk ba
ck home. And we walk
ed home, and on the 
way there she must have seen that I was 
tired. She said Œ we passed an ice cream 
parlor and she says, would 
you like some ice cream? So we sat down. Sh e was a 
very smart woman. She treated me to 
the ice cream, then 
she took me home. 
Walking, mind you. And th en, when we cam
e home, she said, Father must not know 
about it. You go now, undre
ss and go to bed and lie down
. Bu t at dinnertime I want 
you dressed, sitting at the ta
ble, eating dinner with yourfather. And this is exactly 
what I did. He never knew that. He was 
mu ch  mo re sen t i men ta
l that she was. She 
was a very great realist. She knew 
what is going on. Very smart woman. 
Q: What was her family name? 
A: 
Weitz. W Œ w-e-i-t-z, Weitz.  
Q: 
Hitler
 came into power in 1933 and you we
re 16 years old then. Did Œ when  did 
you first hear of him? Were you aw are of that?

A: It™s funny, I wasn™t aware of 
it at all. I mean, I knew he is in 
Germany
, but we 
were Œ this seemed so far away. Total Œ we were totally not concerned about it. Even  
in ™38 I wasn™t concerned about it. 
In ™39, when he finally attacked 
Poland
, this is 
when I realized that very
 hard times are coming.  
Q: So, up to  September 19
39, your life went on? 
A: Was very peaceful, very peaceful. I me
t my husband when I 
was 14 years old. I 
had a cousin who lived in 
Lvov. 
Sh e was a perpetual matchmaker. And sh e probably 
figured out, here is that bo
y who Œ he was a Œ kind of tu
toring children on the upper 
floor where she lived, and she 
th ought he was a very nice boy, she liked him. And 
here I have that cousin of 
mine who is 14, let me intr
oduce them to each other. And 
she did that. She invited me for Œ for 
Pesach
, to come and visit with her, and I did. 
And I went there and she introduced me to
 that boy. And he Œ the first thing he 
asked me was to go for a walk in the park 
with him. And I forgot my  gloves and my  
hands were very cold, and I was always pr
eoccupied about my  hands because of the 
piano. So we were walking in the park an
d he took my hands in
to his hands and he 
say Œ he was Œ see, he said 
to me, I will always keep yo
u warm. He was ready to go 
to medical school, and there 
was i n numerous clauses in 
Poland
, as you know. And 
as his brother lived in 
Italy

brought me some flowers, and I came hom

flowers from? And I said, well, a boy gave 
it to me. My father said, throw it away. 
He went to 
Genoa
 and he wrote letters to me , and of
 course I wasn™t allowed to date 
anyhow, so there was no dang
er of my dating, but Œ 
Q: You™re still 14? 

A: I am 14. And for vacation he came to 
Poland
, so he came to us to visit us. And 
my  mo th er was ab so lu te

Q: His name? 

A: 
Julian. 
He was Œ he was her ideal. He was very well dressed, very sophisticated, 
it seemed to her. And my  father would sa

is a nice boy, but Œ 
there was always a but Œ you are too young. 

Q: He would come to school to wait for me
 an d my girlfriends were so jealous. But 
of course I didn™t date anybody else, and 
Œ and it Œ I waited for him seven years. Oh, 
I Œ one didn™t get married, not unless your 
husband can support you. So I waited for 
him seven years. And then he came to 
Poland
 in 1938, and he wa
s stuck; 1939 the 
war started. So that™s where our tragedy started. 

Q: So wha Œ wh en did yo

his parents, I liked them very much. 
Q: Did he Œ did he talk ab

about it. No, he was in 
Italy

with his brother and sister-in-law in a beau

 didn't  talk about

th ese terrible things
 were happening to 
Jews. 

A: Abso lutely, absolutely, very
 Jewish, very Jewish. And Œ

Julian

Mussolini

 Mussolini

A: In 1939 they came to my 
town, but occupied only one 
part of the town. There™s 
the center river, was the border. The other 
side was occupied by the Russians. 
Q: What Œ what side were you on?

Q: We™re talking about September ™39. 

A: Yes, why was I in 
Lvov
? Maybe I was in 
Przemy
˚
l,
 I don™t remember that. I 
know only that the 
war was, without Œ without pity
, without Œ without any Œ they  
were so Œ the Russians were 
fighting beautifully, but they 
had an order to leave the 
whole city and move back. So they left
 the city and th e Germans consequently 

moved in. And this is when trouble started. 
Q: What was your first impressions of the Germans? 
A: Well, I didn't  Œ I really didn™t realize wh
at is going on. At first I saw some simple 
soldiers in the city, the
 SS
 didn™t move in yet. And it 
was relatively peaceful in the 
beginning. They  didn't start right away with
 the ghetto, the ghe
tto was formed much 
later. But my father was very depressed, he
 probably  felt that it™s going to  be very 
hard. And the first thing th
ey did is to choose a 
Judenrat
. You know what a 
Judenrat
 is? 
Q: The Jewish council. 

A: The Jewish council. And my father was 
chosen as one of those. So  we always 
thought that because he
 is a part o f the 
Judenrat
 he is relatively safe. The first thing 
that I remember is that we 
were sitting in our apartment, 
it was Œ we were not in  the 
ghetto yet, there was no ghetto yet. And a 
few German soldiers knocked at our door 

 
Interv iew with Lena J u ra nd

and I came to the door. And my  father was sitting in th e dining ro om at the table. 
They  didn™t see him. And I came to the doo
r and they ask me whether there are any 
men in the house? And I said no, it™s just 
me an d  my  moth er. And  th ey  look ed  at 
me, they Œ they thought about it for a mome
nt, and they  left. They didn™t go in. Had 
they gone in they pr
obably would have taken my  fa
ther, that was the first time I 
saved him. And Œ 

Q: You are 22 years old now Œ 
A: Yes, I was 22 years old. 
Q: Œ in 1939. 

A: And my father used to say, I don™t know
, I don™t like it, I don™t like it at all. They 
come to the 
Judenrat
 and they ask for a lot of m
oney. You know, they wanted 
money from the me mbers of the 
Judenrat
 and you had to collect
 the money to give 
it to them to pacify them. 
And then  my  father came home one day and said, I think 
we are going to move to a ghe tto. They are forming a ghetto. 
Q: Were there many refugees from other parts of 
Poland
 in 
Tremisz
(ph)
 
by then? 
A: Not by then. They came la
ter. They formed th
e ghetto on the other side of the 
city, which was not primarily 
Jewish. In other words, it was not occupied by Jews. 
And Œ 
Q: Well, that was a little later.

A: Yes. 
Q: Œ let™s talk about the Œ wh
at the conditions were. Up t Œ in the late 30™s what were 
you doing? You were
 still going to that music school? 
A: Yes, I was going to the mu sic school. 
Q: You were going to th e mu sic school all the way up to th e time of the war 
starting? 
A: No. There was one year when
 I took off. I forgot to tell you about it. I Œ I ask  my 
father permission. I wanted to study cosmetology in 
Lvov
, as I had that cousin and I 
could have stayed with her. It took a year. 
My father was terribly against it, he said, 
you want to become a hairdresser? I said
, no, as a hairdresser, I want to study 
cosmetology. Well, he said all right. So I went to 
Lvov
 and I spent a whole year 
there. And that was in 1938. And it was a ve
ry happy year, very nice year. I worked 
there and my Œ when my hu
sband would come for occas

about skin layers, because he was Œ he was 
a medical stu d ent, so he knew more than 
I did. And I spent that year in

Q: Œ the Germans, and how did your life ch
ange then, when the Germans first came 
in? 

A: Well, it became, first of all, much
 more complicated, because there was a 
struggle for food. There was 
a struggle for Œ th
e insecurity, especially was very, 
very, very  Œ I mean, you didn™t know wh at
™s going to  happen the next day. They 
constantly had different or
ders, especially with the
 J udenra t
. I used to help out in 
the 
Judenrat
, my father asked me to come and do
 some work there. So I would sit 
there and I would watch them. But this was 
relatively s Œ quiet the first year. When 
it became really bad was when
 they formed the ghetto. 
Q: What about your father™s business? 
A: Oh, he closed his business. 
Q: When ? 

A: He closed his business when the Russian
s occupied our part of Œ of the city, 
because he was afraid that
 they might send him to 
Siberia
, God forbid. So people 
who owned businesses closed them mo st of th
e Œ most of the time 
they were closed.  
Q: So how did he 
make any money?

very much in favor of
 Israel

Israel

father did not. He said Œ and I very  often 
th ink of his words, he said, the Arab state 
will never let 
Israel

Israel
 doesn™t stand a chance, he said to me, and I was 
very angry with him. I said, how can you 
say that? He says, that™s the truth, why 
don™t you face it? So now when
ever something happens in 
Israel
, I think of my 
father, yes. 

Q: Whe Œ when  did you 
decide to get married? 
A: Well, when 
Julian
 came back from
 Italy
 in 1938, end of 1938, beginning of 
1939, we started thinking ab out it, and even
tually we thought, well he is here, he 
doesn ™t Œ he has no chance to leave the coun

beginning we thou
ght we will get married 
and then we will go to

 And we had the reception at his parents™

Q: Did you have any restrictions when
 you were seeing your husband? Privacy 
restrictions because conditions had been 
changed Œ befo
re you got married, before 
you got married. 

A: Restrictions in what?

night when they took the

Q: And did you have to hand 
over any of your valuables,
 or did your parents have 
to? 
A: Well, I remember Œ I remember that we 
had a beautiful dining room set still. And 
I remember a German woman came with a 
soldier looking at that apartment. And 
she said to him, I want that table. There 
was a very beautiful tablecloth on th e table, 
so my mother tried to take it off and sh e sa
id no, the tablecloth goes with the table. 
And they took it. In other words, they coul

matter at all to us. And then
 wh en we were in the ghetto, of course, it was very

truck, but a Œ mu st Œ probably  my  father 
arranged it. I don™t rememb er this. And th en
 when  his parents came, they had a one 
bedroom ap artment on the same floor. 
Q: What did you bri
ng with you personally? 
A: Very little, really. I don™
t even remember. I don™t re
member being troubled by 
changing my  clothes or Œ or Œ or not 
having enough clothing. I mu st have had 
enough, I always had enough. But Œ but 
I remember very little about it, really. 
Q: Did you bring anything specially pers
onal with you, that meant Œ that had 
sentimental value? 
A: No. I don™t rememb er that either. The 
only thing Œ I know th at my  husband, who 
was always a very particular dresser, and I 
know th at I was standing there, and I had 
an ironing board  and an iron and I would ir
on his pants, because he wouldn™t wear it

otherwise. But I Œ I really don™t remember
 b eing involved in 
Œ or worrying about 
what I™m going to wear. This was so immate
rial at the time. It 
was not important at 
all. That™s funny. And yet, he
 and I, both of us, worked ou
tside of the ghetto. It is a 
very important part of my life. W e work
ed  in a place called Œ do you know German? 
Q: No, but that™s all right.  

A: 
Enklausungstella
(ph). It was a place where they 
have specia Œ they had special 
machines where they brought
 uniforms from the front, full 
of lice and other things 
and they  put them through those machines
 to disinfect them, to clean them. We 

would march out every mo rning. 

Q: We being who? 
A: 
Julian
 and I. He was with a group of men,
 I was with the wo men. And we had 
the armb ands and we were not allowed to 
walk wh ere people walk ed , but we had to 
go where the cars and th Œ the horses were
 going, in th e middle of the street. And 
they would take us every mo
rning out of the ghetto, to 
that place where we spend 
the whole day, and in the evening they woul
d Œ in the af Œ late afternoon they would 
bring us back. The reason why this is impor
tant is because there was one German Œ I 
cannot talk about it Œ about 
him without crying Œ whom I was so grateful to. The 
director of that camp, he was not a Nazi, he was a newspaperman from 
Berlin
. He 
was lovely. He said to me Œ he was always address me the German way, 
Frau

Doktor
, because in German language, the woma
n gets the title of her husband, if he 
is a doctor. So he would come to me and he
 would say, I am so ashamed, I am so 
embarrassed, but I know I am being watche
d. And according to their rules, if 
somebody was caught stealing something, wh
at could you steal something there? A 
dirty pair of socks or a dirty pair of pants.
 He has to give them public beating. So  
one day he came to me and he
 said Œ there was a 15 year old boy there working, and 
he was caught stealing the pair of socks, a
nd he says, I am supposed to give him a 
public licking. Tell him to scre
am as loud as he can. I will not
 hurt him, but I have to 
pretend th at I am doing it, I have been watc
hed. I know I am being watched. So  I did 
that. He didn™t let me work
 with th e Œ with  the uniforms. He says, you are not going 
to wo rk there. You stay in
 the kitchen and peel potatoe
s. And to  this day I cannot 
peel potatoes without turni
ng my  head away . When  the
 SS
 would drop in  
sometimes, if they didn™t have any theateror any recreation they thought that they 

will go, and all the women, young or old,
 had to undress as God has made them. 
Totally naked. Stand in the row Œ I have se
en it, and if Œ they would look th em over, 

and if they didn™t like a pair of breasts, 
they would hit with th
e whip. Anyway they 
didn™t like the back, they would hit in 
the back. He would come running to the 
kitchen and say to me, you don™t go there. 
I will hide you and you can take a shower 
when ever you feel like it. And somebody co
uld have thought that maybe there was a

August 15, 1998 
 

 
 
38
special interest in him in 
me, and it wasn™t. He was Œ he was as mu ch dedicated to 
my husband as he was to me. He said to 
me one day, my  parents have a farm near
 
Berlin
, and I™m making some papers for you so
 you could go there and sp end the 
rest of the war there worki
ng on that farm. T h en somebo
dy gave him out, that he™s 
too good to the Jews. And one day they se
nt him out to th e front, to the Russian 
front. And th e first thing I did when  I got ou
t of hiding, I tried to find out wh at has 
happened  to  him. And I found a boy who was 
with him, and he to
ld me that he was 
killed at the Russian front. I still remember h is last name, 
Burba
, 
b-u-r-b-a
. He was 
a newspaperman. He was so nice. 
Q: How old a man was he? 
A: I would say 26 maybe. 
Q: He was young? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: And what was his first name? 
A: I don™t remember h is first name, just th e last name. He was very nice. He wasn™t 
nice only to me, he was nice to everybody. 
He really felt Œ he was embarrassed . He 

was very nice. It shows you that even 
among them, you could find somebody who 
was nice. So we worked there, day after 
day after day until Œ until they made another 
aktion, 
as they call it, they tried to get peop
le. And I had a cousin
, a young girl, who

was supposed to go to the tr
ain. And my  in -laws were supposed to  go to the train. 
My husband couldn™t make hims elf take 
them, so I took them. I took th em to the 
train. Of course, rumors were Œ we 
knew where they are going. They  had to 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: How did you know 
Œ how did you know? 
A: Rumors. Rumors started that there is a 
concentration camp , that they gas people. 
But we all believed that maybe it was ex
aggeration. Yo u know, nobody wants to 
believe that. So I took them to the train a
nd it was started to rain. And my mother-in-
law had beautiful, heavy hai
r. She didn™t wear anything, 
and I had a s Œ some scarf 
around my  neck. So  I took 
it off and put it on her. And she Œ she Œ she embraced me 
and she said, you tell Œ tell my son that I 
said you will survive the war. I loved my 
mother-in-law. She was the 
sweetest woman. The nicest
 person. I never heard a 
word of criticism from her to any of her da
ughters-in-law. She wa
s lovely. So, that 
was it. That mu st have been in th e summer of ™42.  
Q: Right, this is Œ we™re
 talking about July ™42. 
A: Yes. Must have been  maybe later. While
 we were Œ funny how it happens in life. 
While we were work ing in  that 
Enklausungstella
(ph), Polish woman Œ wo men used 
to come there to buy some bargains from 
the Jewish wo men. We were not allowed 

to carry anything in  our hands. So  wh at we did is, I know I had all my  Œ my  

 
Interv iew with Lena J u ra nd

40
beautiful pure silk nightgowns, hand embroide
red, which I didn™t need. I used to put 
one on top of another on my se
lf, and this way I could carry it with me. And that 
Polish woman, whose husband work ed in  
that camp, because some Polish Œ Polish 
people worked in the camp wh
en they were mechanics or
 they did something with 
the machines. Her husband wo
rked  there, she would co me there. And one day we 
were conducting a transaction, I was se
lling her my  nightgown s, she was buying 

that. And mind you, sh e was a total stra
nger to me. And I was young. And she 
would say Œ she said sudden
ly to me, my God, you ar
e so young, and you are so 
pretty Œ I was pretty at the time Œ and I f
eel so sorry for you. If you want to hide, 
come to me. I was flab bergasted. I says, 
do you realize what you are saying? Do you 
know that if you are caught,
 they put you to death? Sh
e said, I don™t care, I™m not 
afraid. She was the happy-go-lucky type. Th
at was our luck. Well, from that day on, 
Julian
 tried to find out where th
ey lived. And they lived on th
e other side of the city, 
quite a distance from us. Her husband would co
me every evening to the ghetto Œ is it 
working? Œ to the 
ghetto wall, and 
Julian
 would make a packag e of our th ings, and 
through the Jewish policeman give it to hi
m, and he wo uld take that home. So , we 
thought, in case we would ha
ve to go and hide, 
we will have some things there. And 
that was going on for some while, until Nove
mber ™42, when the 
Œ when the rumors 
started to circulate that there will be a new 
aktion
 and they will take people. That

day
 Julian
 said, this time we are not going to  
give anything, we are going out. My 
father wasn™t home, because if my  father 
had been home, he wo
uld never let me  go. 
So my  mo th er said to me, you go better be
fore your father come home Œ come s 
home. We left, it was g etting darker, and 
you know, we had a curfew hour. So we 
had to be Œ go out before th
e curfew. And as we were go
ing down  the stairs to go 
out Œ there was no light in the stairway at 
the time, it was dark Œ I heard my father™s 
footsteps, he was coming up. 
And this stands with me, al
l those years, I still dream 
of that. And th Œ my first impulse was to go to him, but 
Julian
 was behind me and 
he stopped me. And I let my  father pass me
, and I didn't say goodbye to him. That 
was the Œ the worst thing, I thi
nk, in my life. But before we  go to that, I Œ I have to 
step back, before I tell you a Œ

Q: This is a continuation of a 
United States 
Holocaust Memorial 
Museum volunteer 
collent Œ collection interview with 
Lena
 
Jurand
. This is tape number two, side
 A.
  
A: Well, there was one requirement of the 
SS. 
One day they came to the 
Judenrat
, 
and they  required in a very specific way, they wanted th e 
Judenrat 
memb ers to  d o  
their dirty work . They needed 1,000 b
oys, age 12 to 16 being taken from homes. 
And that was the only time I saw my fath
er crying. I opened the door, he was 
standing there crying, and I said, what ha
ppened? And he was tellin g me, and I said 

 
Interv iew with Lena J u ra nd

42
to him, if they want 1,000 
boys, you have to give them
 Œ them 1,000 boys. And he 
said to me, how can you say that, you are 
my  daughter, how can 
Œ how can I go to 
one mother saying, you son will go, and th
e other mother, your son will stay? Am I 
God? I said, you have to do it, because
 if you don™t do it, 
you know what will 
happen. The Nazis will take this Œ this 1, 000 boys, but they will shoot another 1,000 
on th e way. And he said, you are right. An
d they let them have 1,000 boys during 
that particular night. No body slept, of cour
se. Of course the boys were never seen 
again. And I went out in the mo rning, ab
out six o™clock in the mo rning, outside. 
There was not a living soul, 
nothing. Total stillness. Th
ere was not a bird, not a 
wind, not a breeze, nothing. I went into a ra
ge, and I looked up a
nd I said God damn 
you, wh erever you are. This is not the God 
I want. I don™t want any part of you. And 
what™s mo re, I don™t want you to save me. 
That was one thing. As you see, it didn™t 
happen. The other thing was, one 
day they let me know that the
 SS
 came to the 
Judenrat
 and took all the members of the 
Judenrat
 to  the train. And I went wild. 
So I ran to the
 Judenrat. 
We didn't live far away, and I 
had some friends there, and 
they said to me, don™t go in . He is a wild 
animal. He just shot some people, he will 
shoot you. And I couldn™t care less. I went
 in. I didn™t knock at the door, I just 
opened the door, and I can still see him as 
is it was yesterday. He was the most 
beautiful young man I have ev
er seen. Very tall, very bl
onde, very  Nord ic looking,

with blue eyes like two blue ice cubes. 
And he was leaning on th e desk hold ing in 
one hand, in the right hand, he had a Œ a 
gun that was obviously shot a short time 
ago, in th e other a wh ip. I opened the doo
r, he didn™t even  look at me. And I didn™t Œ 
didn™t say anything, I was just standing th er
e. He said to me, what do you want? In 
German. So I answered in Ge
rman. I said, I came to inquire about my  father. And I 
tell him he is a member of the 
Judenrat
 and I hear that he was taken. He still didn™t 
look at me. He wasn't intere
sted at all in what I was saying. Wh at puzzled him was 
that I used such a good German language. 
That impressed him. He said to me, where 
did you learn German so well? I said, well 
German was my best 
foreign language, I 
had it eight years in high school. And I Œ I 
really risk a lot, because I was getting 
fresh, and I said, would you lik
e me to recite you some 
Goethe
? Then he looked at 
me and he said, what about you
r father? I said, well, I hear he is on the train going to 
Auschwitz
. He called two germ Œ two Jewish po
licemen and he said, where is that 
man? So they told him he is on 
the train and they are going to 
Auschwitz
. He said to 
me, you go home and wait. I pr
omise you I will get your father. I didn™t have any 
other Œ I had to go. I came home, and all 
my  neighbors were there and my  mother. 
And when I told them, they 
said, don™t believe it. Nobody
 has ever come out of the 
train going to 
Auschwitz
. And we waited and waited an
d was getting dark outside. 
About 10 o™clock at night we heard some 
footsteps. Two Jewish policemen brought 

 
Interv iew with Lena J u ra nd  
 
August 15, 1998 
 

 
 
44
my father home. Later I was told that th
ey stopped the train on the way and they 
started calling his name
 Salzburg
. My father was so 
fatumult 
that he didn™t even  
react to that. But some body sitting next to him said to 
him, isn™t that your name? He 
said yes. So he got up and 
went out of the train and those two Jewish policemen 
brought him home. He was unconscious fo
r about two days. He didn't know wh at 
was going on. After he got bette
r and he realized that he 
is home, he took my  hand, 
and he said thank you. So I 
gave him a Œ I gave him a-about a year of miserable life, 
but life. I still to this day d
on™t understand what made this
 German keep his word. It 
was puzzling to  me. But he did. They stopp
ed the train, actually. Nobody believed it. 
Those are the two th ings I wanted to te

 experience. Now, 
going back to coming out
 of the ghetto Œ

A: Oh. 
Q: Œ life in the ghetto. 
A: Uh-huh. 
Q: You were there for three m
onths, from July to November?

Q: Okay. What about food, did people have enough fo od at that time?

45
A: Well, we had enough fo od, because first 
of all my father was a member of the
 
Judenrat
, and second we had money 
to buy the food. 
But there was a lot of poverty. 
There were Œ they were Œ you saw in the gh
etto on th e streets, people lying. Oh yes. 
Like you see some, there™s pictures now. 
There was Œ there was a lot of poverty.  
Q: How large was the
 Judenrat
, do you know? 
A: The what? 
Q: The 
J udenra t
, how many people?  
A: 12. 12 people. 

Q: And you had said that you had 
work ed th ere for a little bit? 
A: Yeah, I work ed Œ you know, keeping sc
 Œ ma Œ scores Œ names of people and 
things like that. Nothing that™s very importa
nt, just whenever th
ey needed me, I did 
some work, yes. 

Q: Was this in the ghe
tto or before the ghetto? 
A: In the ghetto, in the ghetto. 
Q: Okay . What did other people think of the 
Judenrat
? 
A: Well, what do th ey think? They proba
bly resented it up to  a certain extent, 
because whenever the Ge
rmans needed something,
 they went to the 
Judenrat
, and it 
was a vicious circle, and th e 
Judenrat
 had to accommodate them, to keep  peace. 
They thought they w
ould; of course, they didn™t. A
nd also, everybody was resent ful 

 
Interv iew with Lena J u ra nd

46
to a certain extent becaus
e they thought that the
 Judenrat
 is safe, and it wasn™t. It 
was just delaying it a little bit. 
Q: Did you know other people on the
 Judenrat
? 
A: Oh yes, there was Œ there was Œ we ha
d a neighbor who was a Œ a doctor and her 
son was a lawyer, he was a me mber of that 
Judenrat
. 
Q: And what were their Œ what was that name? 

A: 
Blech, b-l-e-c-h. 
They were good people, and I 
don™t think th
ey su rvived. 
Q: The first name? 

A: I don™t remember. I don™t remember. 

Q: You said that your father was so
 upset when a thou
sand young boys Œ 
A: Yes Œ 

Q: Œ had to be chosen. 

A: Œ very  mu ch. 

Q: Was he involved in th
e actual choosing, in the

A: No, no, they were not. 
A Œ an aj Œ wh ere Œ I mean, my  father was not, because he 
was too old probably  for th
at. For that mission they 
usually send some Jewish 
policemen with Œ with somebody younger. 
Well, the Jew ish policemen had to do 
their job. They thought that it Œ probably th
at they will save their life, which they 
didn™t, cause a vicious circle.

Q: Did th ey post signs? 

A: Yes, they did, they did, and I Œ I know that th Œ 
Julian
 wo rked  as a physician 
there, in that camp, an d I wo

I said, he was very nice. He

I remember that. Because he was nice to everybody.

Q: Œ would you sit and talk to your parents or other people
 that you knew about 

what was happening, and Œ 
A: We talked very little. We talked very 
little because there was nothing good to talk 
about. I remember co ming ba
ck from work. We were Œ we
 were six people in a row 
work ing. And I happened to be at the end 
of the row. And a Italian officer saw me 
and started walking alongside with me. And 
at that time I knew a 
little Italian, very 
little, from
 Julian
. And he said something to me a
nd I answered and he Œ he to ok 
out the package of cigarettes a
nd wanted to treat me to some cigarettes and I says, I 
don™t smoke, but may I take it for my  
husband? And he gave it to me. So I 
remember that, but I only remember that he
 was very nice to us, and very  apologetic. 
And that really, that man who was in charge
, he felt Œ he felt guilty, although he di Œ 
he himself didn™t do anything, but he 
felt guilty for his fellow Œ for Œ for other 
people. And that™s Œ that™s so Œ is amazi

u a beating, but he will not hurt you. 
Q: And did the bo

He did. And I said to him, don™t steal a

Q: Did you talk to the other women in 
your group as you were marching to the 
camp? 

A: Very little. Very little. Because, first of al

probably . You tried to be as impersonal as
 you possibly can. It™s funny, there were

Q: How was your health at that time?

22 months in hiding, 
when  we went out of the ghetto, we bribed  Œ 
Julian
 bribed a Jewish policeman, who 
probably  bribed the other one, and they
 let us out. They closed their eyes. 
Julian
 
went with  him, with her husband, who led 
the way, and I was behind, walking. And 
as we had to pass the Gesta
po building on the way there.
 There was no other way to 
go. And there was a soldier standing, 
watching. At a certain mo ment, when
 Julian
 
was with him, he said, 
halt. Stopped them. So

he is going to ask him for papers, and thin
gs like that. That was one thing. Then we 
came there. Now, we came to hide, we 
were hidden for 22 months, from Novemb er 

to August ™44. It was a kitchen, you en
tered, there was a little hall, and a pantry 
without the window. That pa
ntry  was very important. And then  you en tered the 
kitchen an d there was one room behind the kitchen. There was no separate entrance 

to the room, it had to be thro
ugh the kitchen. They
 lived all their liv
es, especially in 
the winter, in the kitchen, because there was the stove and it was warm. She 
entertained German soldiers in that kitche
n. We were in the room. We could not Œ 
can you imagine in 22 months
 you cannot sneeze, you cannot cough, you cannot say 
a lot of word , and you cannot make a Œ a loud
 step, and you cannot be sick. We lived 
like that in that room for 22 months. Ther e was no toilet in that apartment. In other 

word s, if we wanted to use the facilities, 
you had to go a half a 
flight stairs down, 
and there was, probably for Œ fo r many peopl
e, there was the facility. People have, 
when  I talk to my  granddaughter™s class 
about it, one boy got up and said, how did

you do without a toilet? I said
, that™s a good question. There was a fire in th Œ in the 
stove, constantly, and that fire helped. Wh
atev er you had to burn, you burned . And 
the rest you pour out down  the drain. So he
 was satisfied when  I explained to him. I 
said, believe me, it wasn™t easy. 
Julian
 developed such  a magnificent sense of 
hearing th at he knew what was going on 
in the kitchen before I knew it. From 
certain Œ he knew wh ich Œ which place 
the floor was squeaking. On e time an 
electrical man came to check the electricity.
 We didn't know he is coming. And of 
course he had to come to the room. So 
that was a Œ there was a mirro r with a Œ a 
piece of furniture with a mirro
r standing in the corner, but 
cutting off that corner, so 
one could hide behind it. Well
 Julian 
s Œ only heard the wo rds, electricity, and he 
pointed to me to go behind that thing and 
he went under the bed. And the room had 
to look always unoccupied, always. He
 came in with her, and I heard her say 
[sighs]
. 
And he lo oked at the ri Œ lamp s or someth
ing, checked. And wh en he left, she came 
in and sh e says, good work guys. The firs
t 10 months, because we accumu late a lot 
of things, of clothing in her house, she wo
uld sell it for us, and we would give her 
the money for the food. Well, after 10 mont
hs, my  things have run out, and I told 
her, we don™t have any money any mo re. So
 she was Œ she was very good about it. 
When  he didn™t see, she would open the doo
r and quick ly push in  a Œ a Œ a Œ some 
soup, let™s say, or some bread. We ate ve
ry little, but whatever it was. There was a

window in that room that was overlooking
 a field, and a young girl would co me 
every day with her cow to let the cow ro
am around. And I wouldn™t stand at the 
window because I was afraid somebody mi
ght spot me. So I would kneel at the 
window and look at her. And I would say to 
Julian
, what I wouldn™t give to be this 
cow. I mean, people don™t know what 
it means. 22 months. She wo rk ed fo r a 
German place. She spoke Germ
an. She didn™t know how to
 read it, but she spoke 
German, for some reason sh e did. And on
ce in awhile she would invite those 
German soldiers over for a party. So I he
lp  her cook an d bake. And then we would 
hide in th at pantry. And she would give them
 enough to Œ drinks 
to make them half 
drunk, and they would lie down on her bed 
and sleep. And when they were asleep, 
we would come in, go right near. I looked at
 them when they were
 asleep, and go to 
other room. When finally the war was al
most over, there was a terrib le fighting 
between the German and the Russian armies
. Terrible fighting. The entire household 
went down to the basement, except us. So
 we were sitting in  the pantry, and 
Julian
 
kept his hands over my  ears so I wouldn™t
 hear that shooting. When  suddenly the 
shooting stopped, and I said to 
Julian
, am I crazy, or did I hear a Russian words 
there? At the moment when 
I said that, she opened the door and she said, you are 
free. The Russians are here, you can go ou
t. There was no joy in  me. Absolu tely 
nothing. So I said Œ my  reaction was, now 
I am going to sleep. And I went to sleep

54
without fear, once. At least once 
without fear, and I slept 24 hours. 
Julian
 went out 
right away. I couldn™t make myself go out fo
r about a week. I was 
afraid to face the 
world. So finally we went out, one Sunda
y afternoon. Beautiful
, sunny afternoon. 
My town , where I was born, where I went
 to school, I didn™t know a living soul. 
And as we were walking, I said to 
Julian
, where are we going? He says, I don™t 
know, let™s just walk. And as we were 
walking a man approach
ed  us. And he saw 
me, and he stood there and said, 
I don™t believe it. Aren™t you 
Isadore Salzburg™s 
daughter? I said yes. Was a lawyer, Jewish
 lawyer. Said to us, where are you going? 
I said, I don™t know, we don™t have a place. He says, come with me , I just opened an 
apartment, it belonged 
to a Nazi. So we went with hi
m. There were no beds, but it 
didn™t matter. I slept on the desk , 
Julian
 slept on the floor. And this was our first 
apartment. And from that day on, I was goi
ng out every day, looking for Jews that 
came out from hiding. And our apartment wa
s full of people in a very short time. 
You were Œ you wouldn™t believe, we wo
uld spend entire evenings telling s Œ each 
other stories. Of course, I didn™t have a pe
nny to mours Œ to our soul. So I Œ one day 
I saw a woman coming out of hiding, and 
I could recognize them coming out of 

hiding a mile away, there was something ab
out the Œ the way they  were walking, 
like we did. And I Œ I saw that woman comi
ng out of hiding, and she was a wife of a 
lawyer, her husband died. And she came out of hiding, so I said, come with me . We 

 
Interv iew with Lena J u ra nd

55
had a Œ a-an  apartment full of people. And she Œ the first thing sh e said to me, she 
took out some money, pocket mo ney Œ pa
per money from her pocket and said, do 
you need any money? It was so unimportant
. Here, have some. And that was the first 
money we got. Then  
Julian
 joined the army, Polish army
 as a Œ as a physician. 
Q: Be-Before we go on to that, I want
ed to ask you a few more questions. 
A: Sure. 
Q: What was the name of the family 
of the wo man that you Œ that hid you? 
A: 
Maria Dambro wska
(ph). Her grandson 
is still alive in 
Przemy
˚
l 
and I sent him 
money. Yeah. And my son graduated 
medical school, he decided to  go to  
Poland
 for 
a visit. He understands Polish, he 
speaks a little Polish. He went to 
Przemy
˚
l, 
she 
was still alive. Of course, I gave him m
oney for her. And I was very curious what 
she will say. When he came 
back I said, what did she 
say when she saw you? He 
says, Mother, you wouldn™t believe it. She 
put her arms  around me and started to 
cry. You know, that after we moved out to 
that apartment that the man gave us, she 
couldn™t stand it. Sh e moved out from her pl
ace and moved to th e same house, to the 
same floor, opposite our apartment. So
 sh e lived there with us again.  
Q: How did you know when  you were in th
e ghetto th at you could trust her when 
she made the offer?

56
A: Of course I didn't know, but did Œ did 
we have any choice? Was either that or 
being on the train. Sooner or later. I mean
, is Œ it was inevitable that we will end on 
the train. 
Q: How did you know that? 
A: Because so many people went. I mean, we
 couldn™t be an ex ception. Maybe not 
sooner, maybe a little later. I finally Œ you
 know I found out that my father was 
taken. 
Q: Tell me about it. 
A: Oh, I Œ I didn't tell you that. As we 
were Œ as we were in hiding, one even ing 

somebody came to the kitchen. We didn™t kn
ow who it was, we just heard the voice. 
And we were Œ from what he said we coul
d understand that he was a Jewish man 
who happened to know her, he
 knew her. And you would al
ways try to find a way, 
somebody who Œ who coul
d help you. So  he thought he
 would go out of the ghetto 
and go to her place, maybe she can take him.
 He didn™t know she had us. I felt very 
guilty about that later. And as he was s
itting in the kitchen and talking to her, she 
asked him what happened to Mr.
 Salzburg
? And he says, oh, he was Œ he and his 
wife were taken on th e train to 
Auschwitz
. And when 
Julian 
heard th at he put both 
hands on my ears so I wouldn™t hear it, but 
I heard it. So later Œ 
my  mo th er wen t  to  
Auschwitz
. After the war, I met a boy who was w
ith my father on the train, who 

 
Interv iew with Lena J u ra nd  
 
August 15, 1998 
 

 
 
57
survived 
Auschwitz
, and he told me that on the way to  
Auschwitz
 the
 SS
 very often 
was making some Œ they tried to find pe
ople who had money, and people usually 
had some money with them. So my  fathe
r, who was very Œ a person that Œ that 
caught the eye, he asks him whether he has 
any money. He said no. He started sh Œ 
looking thro ugh his pockets and he found some
 money. So he told him to go straight 
ahead and he shot him in the 
head. At least he was saved 
Auschwitz
. Yeah. But sh e 
did accomplish quite a lot I must say, this
 woman. Wasn™t easy 
to have two people 
hidden in a small apartment. 
Q: Why do you think sh e did it? 

A: She didn™t do it for money,
 because after the war, when 
Julian
 joined the army, 
and the first money I got, I went to her, and 
I gave it to Œ I wanted to  give it to her, 
she wouldn™t take it. I think she really fe
lt something for us. I don™t know why, I 
don™t know Œ I don™t know the reason, rea
lly, but she felt someth
ing. You know, to 
accomplish Œ to have 22 mont
hs with people where you can Œ and I told her, when 
she first told me Œ suggested this to me, I 
said, do you know what
 will happen to you 
when  you are caught? Oh, I am not afra
id. She was the happy go lucky type. 
Q: How old a woman was she? 
A: She was older than I was.
 She was in her, maybe close to 40 at the time, maybe 
35.

Q: And what was your relation to her husband? 
A: Actually, it wasn™t her husband. You kno
w, the funny thing is that we didn™t 
know it. She was carrying his name and we
 thought they were
 married. Then we 
found out that she™d left her husband and sh e Œ he was just living with her. An d th Œ 

the dangerous thing was that when he Œ he 
used to drink quite a lot. And when  he 
drank he would threaten her with us. An
d that was dangerous. So  we were very 
afraid some times about him. But she could control him somehow. And sh e was 
funny. I used to read German
 papers and tell her what™s going on in the wo rld so 
when  she would go to work  Œ she work ed
 for a German firm, she could tell them, 
and she was well informed
. She was a character. 
Q: What kind of wo rk did she do? 
A: Some Œ not very important. Something 
in the Œ in the o
ffice, maybe. But she 
spoke German, but she didn™t kn
ow how to read it, and she 
didn™t want to admit it.
 
Q: Now, when you were there for those 22
 months, you said yo
ur health was good, 
you did not get sick
, you or your husband? 
A: Not once. Not once. And when 
Doris Schulman
(ph) was wondering about it, she 
says, don™t you get a Œ didn™t
 you get a cold, didn™t you 
have to sn eeze? I said I 
couldn't afford to sneeze. Because well, to 
the kitchen, her neighbors used to come 
to the kitchen and they couldn™t hear us. Th
ey  Œ they  Œ actually the first rule of being

59
hidden by somebody 
in this situation was that abso
lutely nobody must know it, 
because was enough if one 
person would know, and the 
word spreads. About two 
weeks before we were liberated, I had a 
friend in school who came from a very 
Orthodox Jewish family and the 15 people 
of that family  were hidden somewhere. 
And two weeks before the war ended somebo
dy gave them out and they were all 
shot. So this was terrib ly important that
 nobody, ab solutely nobody would know. 
Once it happened that I was wearing Œ I wa
s wearing a housecoat, and sh e said to 
me, come in, and I was sta
nding, you know, at the door
 of the room, between th e 
room and the kitchen, talking to  her, when
 her neighbor didn™t knock at the door, 
just opened the door, came in and saw me. And my  first impulse was to hide, you 
know, but she didn™t lose her nerve. She 
said Œ she imme diatel
y had a story. Tho Œ 
they were Œ those are Polish people and they were in black market, black marketing 
and the police stopped them and they came here
 to hide fo r a few hours. And as soon 
she got her out of the apartm
ent, that woman. And then  she managed to get her back 
Œ she was very clever Œ and she said, look
 through the window, 
there they are, you 
see? They left now. They felt 
more secure so they Œ they
 went away. Here they are 
around the corner. And she made it so
 that the woman never suspected.

months. Wh ile you were in hiding, were 
you aware of wh at was happening in  the 
ghetto? You sa Œ you had me

Œ 
A: Yes. 

Q: Œ your father. Did you 
hear about other things that were going on? 
A: He sometimes went to the ghetto do

Q: Who i Œ who is he? 
A: He is the Œ the Œ 
her supposed husband. 
Q: And his name? 
A: 
Stanislaw
, I believe. And he once, twice or three times brough
t a letter from my 
mother. She came to the ghetto gate and 
probably  handed him the letter. And one 
time he brought me a Œ a ball of yarn, and I was very surprised to see it. I was 
thinking wh at Œ wh at is Œ why did my
 mo ther send me a ball of yarn? Then
 Julian 
started to rewind the yarn, there was a 
ring inside. But Œ well, I knew that the 
conditions are getting worse. Th
ey Œ they Œ he told me a
nd he heard it in Œ and you 
hear it from other people talking, Polish 
people who are talking ab out the conditions. 
It was expected. As the Œ as the war was goi
ng to the inevitable end, it was expected 

that they won™t Œ won™
t leave the Jews alone.

Q: Why do you say that? 
A: Well, they almost Œ they almost Œ a
ll of the Jewish population of the ghetto 
almo st went out to 
Auschwit z
, unless you could hide, wh ic
h was not very often.  
Q: What did you know about 
Auschwitz
 at th Œ at that time? 
A: We knew  that they have Œ that
 they gas people. Oh , we knew th at. 

Q: Where did you get that information from? 

A: Gossip. Letters probably
. Maybe somebody escaped once in awhile. I Œ I doubt 
that, but there were rumors. They were not
 really news, they were rumors. But you 
knew that they do so mething 
with the people. They hadto do something with the 
people. You know, when the 
Ru ssians came in, and finally I Œ we went out and had 
this empty apartment, I met 
a Russian high ranked officer on the street, who said to 
Œ the first thing he said to me is, wher
e is your papa? Wh ere is your daddy? He 
knew him from before. He said to me, he wa
s a fine man. Strange
, how this happens 
in life. I had Œ I had tw o black wo men come 
here one day with a bible. And they ask 
me Œ they wanted to conver
t me, and they  ask me whether I believe in God, and I 

said no, I don™t. Ho w can I? But, on th e ot
her side, I am Œ I am here. This is my 

fourth  life, you know
. First life w as in 
Prze my
˚
l 
as a girl, was very happy. Very 
happy life, no problems. Then th e second lif
e was under the occupation, and hiding. 
And the third life was after the war. And si

He didn™t have a right to leave me alone. 
Oh, there™s something I wanted to tell you, 
very important. When  we went into  hiding, 
we were planning it, I said to him, I 
won™t go u-unless you meet
 my conditions. You have 
to have poison with you 
because I will not go in German Œ to German
™s hands alive. He sa
ys, you can be sure 
I™ll have it. All right. We went into hiding
 and th ere was one night when  the German 
cars were passing by 
[makes tooting no ise]
. And a neighbor came in and said
, 
Marie
, you don™t have to be nervous, they ™re
 just going from house to house looking 
for Jews. Would you believe th
at they went from one hous
e to another, this is the 
only house they didn™t enter? There is so
mething written in the 
stars. At that time 
when I heard those cars and she said they
 are going looking for Jews, I said to 
Julian
, I want the poison now. He says no. Wh en
 they will enter this house, I™ll give 
it to you. They never en tered. That™s na Œ that™s not the end of the story. After the 
war, as 
Julian
 didn™t have anything else but one pa
ir of pant and a sh irt, and he was 
always a snappy dresser, he ask me to pr
ess his pants. I picked them up, and you 
know the European pa
nts are finished with the belt of the same  ma terial. And as I 
picked them up, there was something 
stiff there. So I said to him, 
Julian
, I cannot 
press it like that, there is so
mething in that belt, you have to take it out. What do you 
think it was? Poison. And at that time I ga
ve him such hell for telling me that he 
doesn ™t have it. I said, you 
promise, you don™t keep you
r promise. I was angry at

him. He said, if I would have shown it to
 you, you would have taken it then. This 
way, you waited. And he took it out from hi
s pants. That™s a story, huh? He was a 
very good man. When they t Œ when he di
ed  they gave him a beautiful memo rial at 
Saint 
Elizabeth™s 
Hosp ital. He was clinical director 
there. And they really were very 
nice. Nice people. Everybody liked  him. 
Q: At the time of liberation you said you sl
ept for 24 hours, it was the first time you 
could sleep. 
A: Peacefully, without being afraid, beca

you are afraid at night.

Julian

he walked with a cane.
 When I went with him, it™s Œ 
it™s a strange experience when  
you don™t own anything. No thing. I had a sk

and a shirt. And we walked. And we didn

You don™t own anything. 
Q: You hadn™t really had any physi

Then  one day, somebody knocked at my door
 Œ I wonder whether she is still alive? 
And I opened the door, and I couldn™t figure
 it out, whether it was a wom Œ a Œ a girl 
or a man. The creature was very tall, ve
ry skinny. Shaven 
head, and she spoke 
German to me. She was Hungarian. She sa
id she was with a group of women from 
Majd anek
, Hungarian women, tr
ying to go back to 
Buda pest. 
They stopped in 
Przemy
˚
l
. Each one of them went to a different
 house, knocking at the door, trying 
to get some food or something, some money.
 So I said to her, come in, come in. And 
she came in and I gave her dinner. And she sa
ys she was a daughter of a restaurateur 
in
 Budapest
, she doesn™t know whether her pa
rents are alive. She survived 
Majd anek
 with a group of other girls, each one 
were Œ and I told  her to bring others 
here, I would have all fed them. And I trie
d to get together some money for her for 
the train trip to Œ to 
Hungary
. I don™t know whether she su
rvived that, but I was so 
Œ I was so touched by her looks. I mean, sh
e wore a Œ a Œ kind of a unifo rm coat, and 
she was so skinny. Oh, the pe
ople that we had, it was very interesting after the war 
when  I found those people coming out of hi
ding, and we all stayed togeth er. Didn™t 
matter where we slept. Then 
I found out that two my cous

Warsaw
 as Polish women. And the first oc

asked them to come to

 that they took Mr.
 
Salzburg
 and Mrs.

So that™s how I found my 
mother, otherwise I didn™t

all th ose people and we would sit at the

d can you tell me what you did then? 
A: Well, we Œ we Œ we tried to get some 
beds for the apartment,
 and the first thing 
my  husband bought Œ got fo r me, and I don™t know wh ere he got it, was a concert 

grand piano. And we put it in a room that
 was totally empty. The concert grand was 
in the center of the room, so 
all three of us, all the two gi
rls that came to stay with 
us, all three of us played  the piano, so we gave concerts. 

Q: You decided to 
stay in the town?

A: Well we stayed only temporary. Th
en my husband was shipped as a army  
physician to another town  called 
Zh e s h e v
(ph)
,
 not far from 
Przemy
˚
l. 
Q: So he went in
to the Polish army? 
A: Oh, he went into  the 
Polish army as a cap tain. 
Q: Why? 
A: Because this way he got food and ever
ything, it was easy. An
d they looked for 
doctors there, so he went as a Œ as a Œ a captain 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: Was he Œ was he a specific kind of docto r? 

A: Yes, he was. It wasn™t for the army. He was Œ his specialty was venereal diseases. 

I used to call him the king of th
e horrors. And we Œ he went to 
Zh e s h e v
(ph) as a Œ 
as a army  physician, but he didn't want 
me to go th ere because it was a Œ such a 
small town. So I and this c
ousin of mine, who lives in
 Milburn
, 
New Jersey
, we 
moved 
[pho ne ring ing ]
 Œ we moved to 
Kraków.
 We stayed in 
Kraków
 only a few 
months. In the meantime my  uncle, who was in 
New York
, found out that I am 
alive. I wrote to him, and he had some 
friends, one of whom was a director of a 
DP
 
camp in
 Munich
, 
Germ any
. The other was a director of a 
DP
 camp outside of 
Munich, Germany
. And those t Œ those two sent a 
Jeep
 with two young men 
dressed in 
UNRRA 
uniforms, who came from 
Munich, Germany
 to get us out of 
Poland.
 And they came in and they said, you 
have two hours to decide. We cannot

stay here, we are illeg ally here. Either you 
come with us, or you have to stay. It 
happened  th at my  husband wa
s at that time with us in 
Kraków
 Œ with me in 
Kraków
. And I said, let™s go. So we to
ok our dog and we boarded the 
Jeep
 and we 
went to cross the Polish-
Czechoslovakian border. 
Q: Let™s talk about your dog. Wh en did you get the dog? 

A: We got the dog when  he was in
 the army Œ with the army in 
Prze my
˚
l
. They 
went for some maneuvers to some  residential prin Œ a 
[indecipherable]
 or 
something. And the soldiers 
found that little puppy
 dog, they put him 
in a suitcase or 
whatever and brought him to
 me. And I was so geared 
to ma s
 food Œ towards food, 
that when I heard something m
oving in that Œ in that little 
suitcase, I was sure it™s a 
chicken. That was the dog. He was a puppy
, and he became our baby. So  I have a 
picture wh ere I™m standing on the top of a house in
 Cieszy n, 
where the border 
between 
Poland
 ch  Œ  
Czechoslovakia
 was. And 
Julian
 Œ w-we stayed with a 
Orthodox family, it w as a Fr
iday evening when we a
rrived there. We stayed 
overnight, they were very nice to us. An
d the next mo rning th e daughter of the 
household went to talk to th
e soldier, because we didn™t 
have any papers. She talked 
to him and she probably  convinced  him, so 
he let her open the Œ the Œ the border, the 
thing, the Œ and we went through. 

Q: When was this?

A: That was in 1944. Yes, in 
the summer 1944, very early. So Œ 
Q: So how long 
did you stay in 
Tremisz
(ph)
 
after you were liberated?
 
A: After what? After the war?  
Q: After you were liberated? 
A: Liberated. Not long, a few months, that™s all. 

Q: What were your thoughts about leaving 
Poland
, this is where you were born. Did 
you consider your
self Polish then? 
A: I had no regrets. There was nothing in 
me. Look, we went through so  much, that 
leaving was Œ first of all, al
l my life I wanted to be in
 America
, as I said before, as a 
child. My father kept it up. And my  Œ I ha
d two Œ two of my  fa
ther™s brothers and 
my mother™s si
ster living in 
New York.
 So I Œ I had no regrets of leaving. There was 
nothing in me at the time. And my  only
 preoccupation was to 
cross those borders, 
because we were illegally. 

Q: When you were in 
Tremisz
(ph)
 
after Œ after you were liber
ated, did you see other 
people, besides when  you talk
ed about who you knew before? 
A: The people that I found on th e streets, 
yes, the ones who were hidden like a Œ we 
were, yes. Oh, we talked all th
e time. All the tim
e, absolutely. 
Q: Who was in your grou

Poland
? It was your husband and 
your cousin and you?

A: Yeah. 
Q: So it was the three of you? 

A: Mm-hm. 
Q: Your cousin™s name? 
A: 
Louise Koch
(ph). She married. That™s her m Œ 
her husband was also a medical 
doctor, whom I knew when I was a girl. 

Q: And her maiden name? 
A: 
Za r v i n

Za r v i n
(ph). She was Œ she was Œ they 
were Œ this was Œ her mo ther
 was the one who introduced 
Julian 
to me, and I told 
you, that was her mother. Well, we crossed 
the border, we went on that trip with the 
dog to 
Praga
. We stayed in 
Praga
 one or two nights, I don™t rememb er exactly. We 
didn™t have a penny to our soul, we coul
dn™t buy anything. They  provided fo od for 
us, the two boys who came to get us. Wh
en  we Œ the same way we crossed the 
Czechoslo vakian-German border, when we finally came to 
Munich
, we were lucky 
because Œ because of my uncle™s frie
nds, we didn™t have to stay in a 
DP
 camp, we 
stayed with the 
UNRRA
 people, which was lovely. B
eautiful house with a cook, 
with everything. It was my first contact
 with Americans. I 
used to go in a 
Jeep
 when 
she was touring the neighborho
od, with her. Was very nice
. And when Œ as we were 
staying there, I took a job to  teach some children mu sic in that
 DP
 camp in 
Munich
.

could give something to  those children, I 
like that very mu ch. Except they didn™t 
speak my  language, so I had 
to start with the Yiddish. 
Q: What was it like for you to put your foot down  in 
Germany
? Did it mean 
anything to you? 
A: It meant a lot. I hated every minute of it. I Œ I Œ 
Julian 
insisted I should get a 
good piano teacher to conti
nue my piano education. Well, I got a teacher from the 
conservato ry in 
Munich
 who would come home to me
, but I hated him, because 
every time I would say something about 
the war, he would say, we didn™t know 
anything. And I said you mean to tell me
 you didn™t know? All those golden teeth, 
you didn™t know wh ere they ca
me from? All the jewelry? Th
e work of art? I said to 
him, you know, if I would find one Germ
an who would say yes, I knew wh at was 
going on, but we couldn™t do anything about 
it, I would have some respect for him. I 
hated Œ it came to a point Œ I found out through my  cousin, the one who called here, 
that in a neighborhood hosp
ital for Œ from where we lived
, was a family, a mother 
and daughter and son-in-law, all three very si
ck people, Jews, of course. So I said to 
her, let™s go. We went to the hospital 
and I brought something with me and I 
introduced my self. And we became very, 
very friendly, but the son-in-law had 
leukemia. They  were Œ they 
were hidden in terrible cond
itions and he died th ere in

the hospital. And I would go ev ery othe
r day, I would take the train from 
Munich
 to 
Garmisch-Partenkirchen
 wh ere the sanitorium was. And I would take my  dog 
along, and I buy a ticket for my  dog and he 
had a seat. You know wh at means to be 
angry? I was Œ I had so mu ch anger in 
me towards this ger Œ German people. I 
couldn™t help my self. I would take a chocol
ate with me on the train, and when  would 
I do it otherwise? I saw  those children, 
German children sitting across from me, 
looking at me, and they were looking at th
e chocolate bars that I had. And I would 
unpack a chocolate bar and put the whole ch
ocolate bar into my  dog™s mouth. I had 
some satisfaction. Cruel, but satisfaction. 
After awhile, I said to my husband, I don™t 
care why I live, I can™t stay in 
Germany
. It™s killing me. Absolutely killing me. So 
he found out that there was a train 
of Italians who were brought to 
Germany
 by 
Hitler
 to work in 
Germany
 and th ey were going back  to 
Italy
. So  he volunteered as 
a physician, I went as a nurse, and the dog 
we Œ went as a dog. So  we were t Œ to 
Italy 
by train. And 
Julian
 had a very dear friend of 
his and his brother™s. She was 
Dutch and she lived in 
Mera no  Œ  Mera no . 
When we crossed the Italian border, this 
is where we went. And Œ

A: 
Neue Freiman

A: Yeah, they were mostly about six, seven, eight. 

Q: How did they surv ive the war? 
A: Maybe hidden. I don™t know

Maybe a little older.

Germany

my  joy and we went to 
Italy
. And it Œ 
Italy
, we didn't have money again, we tried to 
find a place to stay, so we found a room on
 the eighth floor without an elevator, and 
I had the dog who had to go ou
t three times a day. It didn™t matter. It didn™t matter. 
Julian
 graduated medical school in 
Genoa. 
This was his second language,
 Italy. 
And he ad ored 
Italy
. So , because he had an Italia
n diploma, he could practice 
medicine there. So we f Œ we fo
und a room in the old part of 
Genoa
 in the port of
 
Genoa
 where he opened his office, so to spea
k. That™s why I called him the king of 
the horro rs, he Œ we would go for a walk  and from up every lantern came a greeting.

And I volunteered as his helper because we
 couldn™t afford sa Œ to pay somebody. 
So I would help him, but he wasn™t pleased
 with me. You know, hi-his specialty was 
skin and venereal diseases. This goes together in
 Italy
. So  he asked me to volunte Œ 
to stay by when  he had a 
patient who had something th
at had to be burned on her 
skin. And I don™t know whether you know wh
at burning of skin smells like. I was 
standing next to him and I was getting pale
r and paler. And he gave one look at me 
and he said, get out. I am 
firing you, you are not a go
od helper. So  we stayed in
 
Italy
 for five years. I learned Italian. In th
e meantime, my  uncle couldn't stand it, the 
one in 
New York
. In 1947 he send me 
a tick et to come to 
New York
 for a visit. And 
I came on a Polish boat, because I couldn™t sp
eak English. I had a ball on that boat, 
it was lovely. I came here with a visa for th ree months, visitor™s visa. I stayed with 
him in 
Long Island
 wh ere he had his house and I mu st say his wife was beautiful to 
me, she wa s such a lovely 
woman. I have never met he

because he used to come to

she was very nice to me, very.

his work ers and introduce me, he was very
 proud of me. And I stayed Œ and he 
would hire Œ he hired a 
young woman teacher from 
Columbia
 University, who 
came to my  house every other day to give me a lesson in English. So after being 
three months there, I had 
a ball. I traveled all over 
New York
, I was in love with 
new Œ I still am in love with 
New York.
 And then I had an uncl
e, my mother™s Œ my

Yonkers
. So I went 
there and he went absolutely bananas with 
me. He Œ where is that other picture that 
is so beautiful I have to  show you? He wa

I would travel all over 
New York
, and then  my  uncle go
t tired of living in 
Long

 because he had to commute downtown, 
it was a little hard on him. He found 
an apartment on

th
 West
, and I had a room overlooking 
Central Park
, which was 
absolutely beautiful. I 
stayed the three months, after th

he is saying, and I looked like a picture of 
health. So I said, excu

And I said to the man, look, I am a surviv

and I have the time of my  life, 
an d I am totally in love with 
New York.
 I would like 
to stay another three months. I have a husband in

Without another wo rd, I got three mo re months in

to wait for me and I 
come out from the plane, I™m very proud 
of my self, I had the new hat, with the

 those shoes with the strap at the ankle, 
and I had those shoes. I was very proud 
of my self. I had the new suit. My other 
uncle, my Œ my father™s older brother was in fur business on

th

me a beautiful brown Persian coat, full lengt

happy months for me, I really loved it. I wa

my husband, what will happen if they
 don™t late Œ let the dog go to 
America
? I 
mean, this can happen. Very 
seriously he said, then I won™t go. He went to the 
American embassy in 
Genoa
. He got every shot given to 
the dog by the veterinarian 
there, we got a pile of papers, we paid $50
 for his Œ we Œ we came by boat here. And 
we were assured the accommodations 
for the dogs are very good. But Œ

A: This one.

A: A shepherd. And he didn™t like people, so
 he had to wear a mu zzle. And we come

Julian
 said, I want to 
see the accommodations for th Œ my  dog. So
 he went to the upper dock Œ deck  and

 directed the first play, which was 
Pygmalion.
 It was

a smash hit. And I helped with everything
. Make-up, costumes, everything th at was 
to be help ed.  
Q: Can we talk a little bit now about some of
 your thoughts and your feelings about 
what you went through? Do you think you 
would be a different 
person today if you 
had not gone through what
 you did, what you experienced during the war? 
A: Probably . 

Q: In what way? 
A: I am sure I would have 
been different. First of all,
 maybe I would have been  
more religious, which I am 
not. Second, I think it gave me a certain insight into 
human s-suffering, otherwise I wouldn™t have 
known it. I led a very sheltered life as 
a young girl, very sheltere
d. Good life. And I didn™t
 know mu ch about human 
suffering. I learned a lot. So I Œ I think Œ I th
ink in this respect Œ it™s hard to say that 
the war was beneficial for me, it isn™t benefi
cial to anybody. But I think that I gained 
more understanding for people. For pe
ople suffering, especially. I hope so. 
Q: Are there any sounds or sights today th at 
you hear or you see, or any smells that 
kind of bring back  your expe
rience during the war, either in
 get Œ in the ghetto, or in 
hiding? 

A: You mean sounds? 
Q: Sounds, sights, smells. Anything th
at triggers what you went through. 

 
Interv iew with Lena J u ra nd

83
A: Very easily, very eas
ily, can trigger anything. 
Q: Such as? 

A: Or men you Œ even when  you listen to 
news and you hear Œ or you see people 
suffering in so many countries, and you thi
nk, isn™t there an end to it? I Œ I am 
specially very vulnerable if 
it comes to children suffering.
 And when I see, let ™s say 
in Œ in 
Yugoslavia
, the children who are without fo od, without medication, I suffer. 
I do. Because I thought maybe Œ maybe we
 have filled out th
e Œ the suffering of 
people. Maybe it™s enough. But it isn™t en
ough. It goes on and on and on. Why? 
E v en  Œ  ev en  th is last 
[indeciphera ble]
 the bomb s, that so many Americans have 
died, and local people. Any 
crazy person can Œ you know, 
my father was a socialist 
and I used to discuss politics with him, a
nd I Œ I was very angry at him because he 
said he doesn™t believe 
in forming the state of 
Israel.
 And I said, why? He says, 
because the Arabs will never, never leave th
em alone. Very often when I hear the 
news, I can see that he was right in many wa
ys. But, look, we will always have wars. 
There will be always crazy people who w
ill try to do so much damage. We cannot 

help it. We are not responsib le for everybody. I wish 
Julian
 would have lived 
longer. I still feel that he 
didn't have any right to leave me alone. He never left me 
alone in 57 years. If it wouldn™t have been
 for him, I wouldn™t have survived the 

war. I am sure of it. I didn't  Œ I was very 
sheltered all my life. I didn™t know how to 

 
Interv iew with Lena J u ra nd  
 
August 15, 1998 
 

 
 
84
cope with  it. And it was he who Œ wh
o staged it, who arranged it. He was 
responsib le for everything, even  after the wa
r. And he left me in three days. It isn™t 
right.  
Q: When you were raising you
r son, did you Œ and Œ and 
let™s say when he was at 
the age that you were when 
the war started, 22 wh en th e war started. Did that bring 
back memories for you of th
e war? When he became the ag
e that you were when the 
war started? 

A: No, it didn't bring Œ I did tell him about everything, oh yes. He knew about 
everything. But I Œ I didn™t Œ I didn't resent
 his getting older. Or I didn™t connect this 
with the war in any way.  
Q: Wer-Were you very protective of
 him when  he was growing up? 
A: To some extent yes, but don™t forget th
at he grew up, his first years were in the 
country, wh ich was very nice. We ha
d the nice community there, rather 
international. We had a doctor from 
Vienna
, and we had a doctor from 
Czechoslovakia
. We had a nice group of people. 
Q: Are you angry that you had to go th rou
gh these very difficult 
times and others did 
not, sitting in this country, let™s say. 
A: You mean, to people who were here in this country? 
Q: Right.

A: What I resent about Œ 
Q: That you had Œ th at you 
had to go Œ are you angry th
at you had to go thro ugh 
that? 
A: No. 
Q: And others did not? 

A: It™s nobody™s fault. It™s not Œ certainly 
not people™s fault and I Œ I am very happy 

that I came to this country. I love it here. 
Q: What were your thoughts during th e
 Eichmann
 trial in 
Israel
? 
A: I would have killed him. 
I was very happy that the Is
raelis got him. Serves him 
right. Too bad he didn't
 get mo re. And I looked at him as
 he was standing at that trial 
and I was thinking, you know,
 he looked like 
a little Jewish man. Didn™t he? It™s 
funny how it happens. But I was very gl
ad they got him.
 Very. No pity. 
Q: What are your thoughts about 
Germany
 today? The modern Germans. 
A: I know. I wouldn™t live ther
e if you give me millions. 
I don™t buy anything that™s 
mad e in  
Germany
. I used to tell my son, when y
ou will be older, 
and you want to 
marry somebody, you can marry
 anybody of any religion you
 want. But if you ever 
marry a German, I will not know you. I re
sent them very greatly. Greatly. As a 
matter of fact I had a friend who was a wife 
of a rabbi. She was a very dear friend of 
mine, she work ed with my  husband in  
the hospital here. And her daughter, the

86
daughter of a rabbi went to 
Germany
 to study something an
d she met a German and 
she married  him. And sh e lives in 
Germany
. And every time I saw her, I was 
thinking, how can sh e? How can she have 
any relationship with those people? I 
cannot. I couldn™t. I couldn™t do it. As
 a matter of fact
, about 12 years ago 
[indecipherable]
 we went to 
Vienna
 and 
Buda pest
. 
Julian
 had so me meeting in 
Budapest. 
When  we were going to 
Vienna
, he said to me, you will love
 Vienna. 
Oh, you will absol Œ well, I ha
ted it. Every time I was in  
Vienna
 and I had to  listen 
to that German and I was thinking, this is the country that gave us 
Hitler
, I couldn™t 
stand it. I enjoyed 
Budapest
 very mu ch, but not 
Vienna . 
A funny thing happened to 
us, we went to 
Jerusalem
. There was a Œ 
Julian 
was supposed to read the paper, 
there was a psychiatric meeting in 
Jerusalem, 
and he was reading a paper on Œ on 
the war, something about the war. And we were
 sta Œ we were Œ we were staying at 
the 
Hilton
 in  
Jerusa lem
 and we met another couple. 
Very handsome man, who had 
on a golden chain, a big letter chai. So you
 thought he was Jewish, yeah. He was a 
Presbyterians minister. And 
I still have a letter that his wife wrote to me. We 
became very friendly with this
 couple and we had one taxi, and the taxi driver drove 
us around. And I said to 
[indecipherable]
 how co me you sp eak English so  well? He 
says to me, I am from 
Brooklyn
. And we were Œ we s Œ we
 went to a kibbutz wh ere 
we spend the night. Was a nice kibbutz, well kept. And we went to 
Mosa da
(ph), of 

 
Interv iew with Lena J u ra nd

course. And then we Œ we traveled to
 the ocean. Oh, we had a great time in
 
Jerusalem
, I loved it. She came running to 
me, his wife, on a Friday and said, 
Lena,
 
quick ly, quickly, you have to 
get ready. I want to see the Jews dancing at the wailing 
wall. 
Q: What are your thoughts about 
Israel
? 
A: About what? 

Q: 
Israel
. 
A: I liked it very much, but Œ but 
I am not very optimistic about it Œ 
Israel. 
You 
know, if they keep giving away  Œ 
Israel 
is small, if they ke
ep  wanting mo re and 
more from 
Israel
, how long will they stay? I am
 Œ I am a little hesitant about 
Neta nya hu,
 I don™t know whether he is doing su
ch a good job. But I love the 
atmosphere. I felt very comfortable there. That Œ 

Q: Why did you feel comfortable? 

A: Because it™s such a relaxed atmosphere th
e Israelis have. With everything that™s 
going around th em, it™s amazing that they ca
n forget about it. Or maybe not forget, 
but try to forget. It™s beautiful. 

Q: Are you more comf ortable around peop
le who went through th e war, than those 
who did not?  

A: No Œ 

 
Interv iew with Lena J u ra nd  
 
August 15, 1998 
 

 
 
88
Q: More comfortable around other survivors? 
A: You know, this is a very strange ques
tion th at you ask me, and I™ll tell you why. 
There is a couple here, they™re not Jewish
, very nice couple who Œ whom I met at 
some friend™s house. And they  probably 
thought Œ they knew 
somebody else who 
was from 
Poland
, also a survivor. So th
ey thought that if they
 put me together with 
another survivor, I will feel 
mu-much more relaxed and so
 on. And they invited me 
to dinner one time. And I went to dinn er and there was the other woman. And I 
didn't  like her and sh e didn't like me, a
nd I know it. So you never know. I Œ I get 
beautifully along with Ameri
cans, I love Americans. I th
ink Œ I don™t have to have 
people wh o Œ who went through everything, 
as I did. Course, we enjoy it. As I was 
telling you that I went to see that family 
in the hospital with their gra Œ son-in-law. 
Well, the woman, the young wo man was a public prosecutor in 
Poland
. She was a 
lawyer by profession and sh e wanted to co
me to this country 
desperately. So, we 
went together for the Œ you 
know, befo Œ it took five ye
ars for the amer Œ for the 
Americans immigration office to give us a 
visa to come here. That™s why I get so 
upset when I see that they let so many pe
ople in without Œ without really knowing 
anything about them. They x-rayed us, we went to 
Na ples, 
we had to go through 
some questions and well, the x-rayed show
ed Œ her x-rayed showed that she had a 

tiny spot on her lungs. Every doctor, including 
Julian
 gave her a statement that 

 
Interv iew with Lena J u ra nd  
 
August 15, 1998 
 

 
 
89
there™s absolutely nothing wr
ong with her lungs, they  wouldn™t let her in here. So 
she went to
 Israel
. And she became a lawyer there in 
Haifa
. We visited her when 
we were there. And a Œ but why do I say 
that? In connection 
with what? I don™t 
know. She passed aw
ay since then. 
Q: Di Œ did your Œ 
A: She used to write to me. 

Q: Did your husband do any studies, any re
search on su rvivors? You had said that 
he gave a paper on it Œ on them. 

A: Oh Œ oh yes, he wrote the paper, yes. 

Q: Did Œ did he do re
search on survivors? 
A: Oh yes, oh yes. 

Q: What kind of research? 

A: He met with all kinds of people. I wasn't 
involved  in that, he didn't involve me in 
that. But he did meet with the people w
ho su rvived the sp Œ from the psychiatric 
point of view , what Œ what™s Œ wh ere th
ey had left anything. Well, of course, 
everybody who survived that 
war has to be affected in some way or other. I mean, 
you cannot be a normal person after survivi
ng this. Like being hidden for 22 months 
without being able to say a 
word  loud, or Œ or sneeze
 or cough. Ho w can you be 
normal? I mean normal, depend
ing what you mean by norma
l. But that™s very hard. 

 
Interv iew with Lena J u ra nd  
 
August 15, 1998 
 

 
 
90
Very hard. I find that my Œ my attitude to 
people is completely different. I mistrust 
people much more than I di
d when  I was young. I didn't
 know anything about life. 
Well, here I am, at the end of my rope. 
Q: As you™ve gotten older, do you think mo
re about this time in your life, the war 
time? 
A: Do I think more? Yes. 

Q: A-As you™ve gotten older. 
A: Yes, yes, absolutely. Much more. I an
alyze mu ch mo re. I would love to go once 
more to my town.  
Q: Had you ever
 been back? 
A: Never. Never. When I left 
Poland
 I swore I™ll never come back.  
Q: Why do you say now y
ou would like to go back? 
A: Huh? 
Q: Why do you say no
w that you would like to go back ? 
A: Cause I™m getting older. I think a Œ it woul
d be nice to see the old place. It was 
such a nice town . We didn't have any crim
e. Noth ing ever happened. On ly once a 

woman, a Jewish wo man divorced her hus
band and married somebody else. It was 
the greatest scandal the town has ever heard o
f. It was a v ery peaceful life. Nice life, 
nice life.

A: Abso lutely. I read Po
lish books. I like the Pope because he is Polish. 
Julian
 left 
quite a few Polish books, I didn™t realize 
when I was looking th
rough the books. So I 
started reading them. I didn't  read th
em since I was 18 years old. Quite an 
experience. At the beginning I thought I™ll 
have a hard time, but it wasn™t work ing 
that way. It™s nice. 

Q: What language do yo
u think in  every day? 
A: What language do I think? Mostly Eng
lish, mostly English. When I am with my 
Polish friends we speak Polish, but Œ 

Q: These are Polish-Jewish friends, or Œ 
A: Not Jewish. Non-Jewish. 
Q: You have Polish friends here? 

A: Yes, yes. As a matter of fact, I have so
me books which I want to give them. But I 
sp Œ I think mostly in Eng
lish, yes. Became a habit. 
Q: So, do you harbor any f
eelings, negative feelings to
wards the Polish people 
during th e war? 

A: I personally don™t. I have no reason,
 I have been saved by a Po lish wo man. I 
don™t think we would have surviv ed the 
war without her. Whether she did it Œ she

didn™t do it for money. Why she did it, 
I don™t know, but I™m grateful to her. So 
that™s why I take care of her grandson. 
Q: Do you receive any reparati
on money? M
oney for reparations? 
A: No. No. I know 
people get it from
 Switzerland
. First of all, I don™t know 
whether my  parents had any account. No , I don™
t. I don™t need that money. I Œ I have 
two granddaughters and I hope
 they will never know what
 it means to go through a 
war. It™s devastating. I often think about 
it. But I had a good husband and he was Œ 
he pulled me through it. I would have neve
r su rvived without hi
m. First of all, I 
would have gone with my  
father, and second, I didn't 
know how to do it. He was Œ 
he was the one who arranged everything 
for me, yeah. Strange. I never thought 
when I was young that I will go through su
ch a war. What makes one crazy man do 
things? And they were Œ there were some ve
ry bright, intelligent people in his group 
who followed him. That is th
e tragic thing. When I read 
the story of Œ wh at was the

was the Œ the forces, the Œ his for Œ he Œ 
Rommel. 
He was a bright, intelligent man, but 
he was caught. He was caught. There 
were more men like that. This is Œ this is

people followed him. So you wo rk  for th

Julian

And we spoke to her class, which was th

mu st have been Œ maybe she was eight, some
thing like that. And then they ask us in 
that school would we speak to th e older ki
ds, and we did. And I was amazed, really 
amazed at the attention they 
gave us. And the questions th
ey ask us, they were very 
bright questions. Especially about the Œ 
the part where we described in what 
conditions we were hi
dden. Very bright. 
Q: Why did you do this? 
A: Well, he wanted us to talk to them. 
The principal was curious and he wanted  us 
to talk to them, and I Œ I thought it was Œ be
 very interesting for 
kids to know wh at 
people go through, and they still live a norma
l life. And he even ask me this year too 
to talk to, but I didn™t, becau
se I didn™t feel up to it, but maybe I Œ I™ll do it, if he

know that you can go

and live a normal life. You feel yo

country, I feel that we have led a very 
normal life, yes. I am happy. 
Q: Do Œ do you feel totally a
ssimilated into American culture? 
A: Yes and no. I am quite critical about th
e president, you know. And Œ but yes, I 
am, I am. I like this country . I™m very happy 
here, and I often thi
nk of my  father, he 
loved this country. The lower east side of
 New York.
 He loved it. My mo ther had 
another sister who was a very active 
with a Jewish newspaper here in  
New York, 
is 
it 
Forward
? 
Q: 
ﬁThe Forward.ﬂ 
A: Yeah. Yes. But she passed aw
ay. She lived there, downtown 
New York.
 I used to 
visit her quite often. So that™s my  life history. 

Q: Is there anything else we Œ you woul
d like to say that we haven™t covered? 
A: What else to say to you? You know, 
my  son, wh en he was 20 years old and was 
in medical school, he fell in love with a 
very lovely Jewish girl. And I Œ I thought 
they were a little bit too young
 to marry, but he insisted 
Œ they were both 20 Œ he 
insisted they get married
. They got married
, they had a little apartment near 
GW
 
where he was going to medical school. A
nd I thought everything was beautiful until 
about maybe six or seven months after they
 got married, he ask us to come over and 
we did. And she was sitting next to the wi
ndow, and I says, what is it sweetheart?

Maybe we come here maybe too often, I 
thought, maybe it™s t
oo much for her. She 
says no, you know, I love you, but I just
 don™t want to be married any mo re. And it 
was a terrific blow to him, really bad. 
Sh e was the one who got the divorce and as 
far as I know, to this day she didn™t remarry
. So then  he met this girl, and she™s not 
Jewish. And he married her, and seem lik
e a good marriage. 
She works for the 
World Bank. Sh e™s a good mo ther. I would have preferred marry a Jewish girl, but 

who am I to say something? And he seems 
to be work ing out very  nicely. He took 
over the psychiatric divi
sion of the hospital in 
Martinsburg, West Virginia
, and he 
directed now a play in the th
eater, he goes in his father™s
 footsteps. And he wants me 
to move there. So I don™t know what life w
ill bring, whatever it 
is. And I think it™s 
very nice of you to sit here and listen to
 me for such a long time. You mu st be 

exhausted.
