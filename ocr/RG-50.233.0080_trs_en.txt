 his mother, father, and 
two brothers when the 
Germans invaded. He recalls several days of 
bombings. His brother was

Nathan never saw him a gain. Nathan was put to wo

When the deportations to the camp started, he hid 
in a wall with his mother, but brought her out

as a tailor in Birkenau, and in 
Auschwitz he was put to work out

Yes. From my father™s si de, all the fami ly

More modern, was moreŠso my father was ve
ry modern in our home . As a ma tter of 
fact, if I have to tell you the truth, my mother di
dn™t get along with my father™s side. I find out 
now here in the United St ates about my mother 
and my father. My grandfather™s very happy to 
marry for my mother from my father™s side.I 
me an the sisters already were against her. My 
grandmother, she was a very strict, very re
ligious person. [Female voice: And your mother 
wasn™t]. My mother wasn™t.
 
 
Anthony:
 So they objected to your mother 
because she wasn™t religious enough?
 

 
Nathan: 
But, I mean, they were happy. What™s true 
is true, my mother wasn™t very happy. She 
never went to them but they all came  to my mo

brothers and sisters, 
13, a very big fa mily.

brothers and sisters?

 So you had a lot of--?
 
 
Nathan: 
Well no, our family na me  in town was very well-known. All the people know us even 
in the United States and Cana
da. My grandmother come s fromŠshe had a title on my father™s 
side. A title like, you know. I forget in Yiddish ho
w they call her. Like ﬁca
balleroﬂ in Italian, you 
know, some thing. She had a title in Yiddish. They 
were very respected people. They had very 
big business. My father come  from a  very 
wealthy fa mily. We ma ke
 lots of charities.
 
 
Anthony
: Is this because of the furniture factory?
 
 
Nathan: 
No, no. That is from my father™s side. They 
were very big wholesalers, but we re very 
respected people. We  help lots of people. Not 
to brag about it, you know, people in Poland used 
to be Jewish people, beggars. They used to come
 to my grandmother, she was like a soldier, she 
was bitchy, excuse my expression, but she is. Some  
of the m, they used to come  two, t hree time s. 
Understand?
 
 
Anthony
: Yes.
 
 
Nathan: 
But she got all laid down enough charity money for  them, everybody. Even the 
Christians, they used to come . She was a very educated woma n.
 

 
Anthony
: Your grandmother?
 
 
Nathan: 
Yes, she spoke Russian, Polish, German, of
 course Yiddish and Hebrew, you know. In 
those days a woma n in Poland in that time, very  few were educated. She wa s a very educated 
woma n. I don™t know if you know Polish history. 
Poland has the greatest
, biggest illiterate 
people in the world. That  was Poland until Cuszevesky (? ) (95) came into power. Then it was a 
law. I don™t know today, but you see very few wo
me n know how to read and write. My mother 
know how to read and write.
 
 
Anthony:
 What kind of school did your mother go to?
 
 
Nathan: 
Well, I do not reme mber that where she we
nt. This I really don™t reme mber. I don™t 
know even my father. I was just a kid, do you unde
rstand? My mother used to go to school, she 
was a teacher for poor people. She was very-- [Fem
ale voice: very active in
 school.] Very active. 
She was a very good-looking woma n.
 
 
Anthony:
 I can see in the photo.
 
 
Nathan: 
I can reme mbe r  like today, she used to
 have long hair, she was a good singer. 
 
 
Anthony:
 Your mother was a singer?
 
 
Nathan: 
Yes, a very mo dern type. Co mpletely different. My father™s side, they were all very 
educated, but different type. They didn™t talk
 much, but if somebody laughed, they were very 
serious people; you understand?
 
 
Anthony:
 Yes, yes.
 
 
Nathan: 
She met my uncle here mo nths ago, but th
e same  time, well I am very well-known. If 
you were to ask people in the United States who 
come from our town, we were very well-known. 
We used to have big orchards, miles 
and miles of orchards. My grandpa™s--
 
 

Anthony:
 Your father™s parents?
 
 
Nathan: 
Father™s. They didn™t know what to do with
 the money. Thank G-d I had everything in 
Poland. I had in Poland, America. Not Ameri
ca in the United States, Thank G-d we had 
everything. My mother, we had two ma ids, one wa
s sleeping, one used to come . I don™t want to 
talk about it. 
 
 
Anthony:
 How did your mother and father meet?
 
 
Nathan: 
Well, this I don™t know. I found out, you see, 
in the United States, They are talking 
about my mother. My father went to
 the army, he don™t lose my mother.
 
 
Anthony:
 He was in the Polish Army ?
 
 
Nathan: 
Polish Army and he didn™t want to lose my 
mother. When he went to the Army, he got 
my mother, he didn™t say nothing to his father, nothing because they didn™t let him. They went 
and they got married.
 
 
Anthony
: So they eloped?
 
 
Nathan: 
They were good after that but it looks like,
 you know--. My mot her never forgive them, 
they always came to us, because we were livingŠ
see like I live here, I ha ve lots of land, you see 
that?
 
 
Anthony:
 Yes.
 
 
Nathan: 
I always like to live in th
e suburbs, because that™s how I was brought up. Next was a 
river. We  have lots of tree, we have a terrific life. 
 
 
Anthony
: So your father had his own house and his own land?
 
 

Nathan: 
See this house really belonged to one who wa
s a very big shot in the coal mi nes. He 
didn™t want to sell it. We  never owned itŠhe gave
 that to usŠwe paid him. Mostly private. 
Private, he won™t sell it. He liked my mother, he
 liked my father. There we re very few people in 
Poland who talked Polish. When th
ey needed some thing, they came to my father™s factory; my 
father used to help them, so we got the house a
nd we lived there by ourselv
es. He didn™t want to 
sell it. I was born in that house. At
 that time  they didn™t go to the 
hospital, they used to come  to 
the house and deliver the wome n -- they were mi dwif
e. I was back in Poland after the war. This 
is on now, everything what I™m talking here?
 
 
Anthony:
 Sure.
 
 
Nathan: 
Oh my gosh. I didn™t want to say that. I 
was thinking you were asking that. I didn™t 
want to say the story about it, this about my
 fatherŠstoryŠand mother
. This, I wouldn™t like 
that, you understand? I™m talking th
at to you. If you can cancel that--.
 
 
Anthony:
 Sure, sure. Now your mother, what languages did she speak?
 
 
Nathan: 
Polish.
 
 
Anthony:
 Just Polish?
 
 
Nathan: 
And my father. Some times they talked Yiddi
sh with my father, but we did not know a 
word in Yiddish.
 
 
Anthony:
 You didn™t? As a child you didn™t know Yiddish?
 
 
Nathan: 
No, very little. But my grandmother, my  fa
ther was very touchy about it, my mother. 
My grandmother used to call us ﬁgoyim.ﬂ Y
ou know what means that
?  Christian type. My 
mother was very touchy, because we
 didn™t know how to talk Yiddish.
 
 
Anthony:
 Your mother was Jewish?
 
 

Nathan: 
Oh yes, a good Jew. She was a good Jew, but 
that had nothing to do with it. She was a 
very good Jew. Only she was modern becauseŠnow I™m scared to talk, becauseŠ
 
 
Anthony:
 Don™t worry. How--?
 
 
Nathan: 
You see my mo ther used to have polished na
ils and lipstick. At that time  from my 
grandmother, my father™s side, she used to say only whores wear that because she was ve ry 
modern, she was so educated. 
 
 
Anthony:
 It was a generation gap between 
your grandmother and your mother?
 
 
Nathan: 
Yes, as a ma tter of fact, my  father™s si ster
 lived in Br eslov (now Braslaw), in Germany 
and all around. So she was the only one who would tell her off. She would say ﬁMaﬂ, in Yiddish, 

ﬁMama, you are not living in modern times.ﬂ 
Saturdays she used to come  from Ger many, she 
used to come  direct to me . She wasŠ.

him, years and years. He picked himself up and 
he left the house after a di spute when he came 
back from the war or Russia, I don™t reme mber 
exactly, but I found out after the war. He left 
money in the house, so her sister
 lived in France, my mother™s 
sister, and what my gr andmother 
did, she give all the money to her sister as dow
ry and they gave his money away. When he found 
out, he got ma d, and he left the house and theynever heard from hi m. I found out when I was in 
1980, I was in Israel? Or ™81 or ™80, I don™t reme mber. I went to see my uncle, my mo ther™s 

brother and I ask about him. He
 told me  no, he was in Hamburg, Germa ny, ma rried a German 
Christian. So I ma y have some  cous ins there too.
 Germans, we don™t know what™s what. But my 
mother™s family was a different type, especially
 at that time , you know. So that™s how I found out 
Œ he told me , he lived in Ha mburg, Germany 
and that his wife was a Christian German.

nce a kid, so we didn™t we nt to Hebrew. I was 
already acquired as a Jewish th

 with the Kaddish, prayers, 
and like with T™fillin. You know what T™fillin is?
 
 
Anthony:
 Yeah, yeah. When you say the prayers.
 
 
Nathan: 
So my father told him, to the teacher, he say, look, he ™s a good ki d, but reme mber, he 
doesn™t know how to talk in Yiddish. You have to
 have patience with him. My brother had more 
patience, I was a hot te
mper -- [You still ar e].
 
 
Anthony:
 Still is?
 
 
Nathan: 
Yes, and how, very hot. So when he started he
 went to Hebrew School, he talked to me , 
I didn™t understand him,  so he used to beat me
. You know, they have a stick, and he didn™t teach 
me . Not only that, I couldn™t stand his smell, from the stinking from ba
d odor in the mouth. So 
one day, I told him I couldn™t take it. I ran out

at™s it. I didn™t went any 
more. I finished. ____________ (228) Th
at™s all. Then during the war came  a private in the 
house, because I was supposed to have a Bar Mitzvah, I know. So he teached me . I had a 
problem with him, too. But I know how to read in
 Yiddish, I mean Hebrew. I learned. That was 
the problem.  We  weren™t that re
ligious, but we had holidays, Pa
ssover, all the holidays. As a 
ma tter of fac t , every holiday came Pa ssover ever
ybody had new suits, everything. It wasn™t so 
easy in Poland. But I got to my father, we were 
thick. My mother wasn™t religious, but she kept 
up the tradition.

because where we used to live there used to
 be a castle across, ______ (263) castle and I know 
my father, when he used to get ma d because 
I know what he can do, but he  wouldn™t do it.

going, but mostly people who could afford to pa
y, private school. It was a public school Œ [semi-
private], semi -private, yeah. You understand?
 

 
Anthony:
 So it was a Jewish school, partially supported by public money?
 
 
Nathan:

Nathan: 
Yeah.
 
 
Anthony:
 Do you reme mber anybody in your family talking about Hitler and the Nazis?  Did 
anyone pay attention?
 
 
Nathan: 
Well, they were talking. It started alrea
dy in 1939, when our town, the Polish became 
the Nationa list Part y. They used to ca ll them 
INDEKI (?) (296), the In
ternational Polish Part y, 
anti-Jewish move me nt. But here we
re lots of Poles, Christian, wh
atever, against it. I meant but 
that™s how it started. It starte
d when Hitler started to go into 
power in Germany. Then by us we 
know everything Œ we knew about it. 
 
 
Anthony: 
Being close to the border with Germa ny, you 
must have seen refugees coming from 
Germany?
 
 
Nathan: 
Well, I tell you, I was too young about it. I di
dn™t know too much about it. I know when 
my aunt came  Œ when they chased her out of
 Breslov, today it™s called Braslaw, (317). I 
reme mber that because they used to talk, they used
 to tell him to sell the
--. He has lots of houses. 
She was a ______(309) in Germany. Very 
rich person. That™s how I find out.

Nathan: 
No, no.
 
 
Anthony: 
No one lived in Germany?
 
 
Nathan: 
No. We  didn™t know that maybe she knew about her brother, butI don™t think so, she 
knew it about. I told you his name  was Rome k, like my brother. I find out now in 1980, when I 
was in Israel, I asked about him, if they know some thing about the brother. But they never talk 

about him. So that™s how I find out, when I was in Israel.
 
 
Anthony: 
Did anti-Semitism affect your father™s business?
 
 
Nathan: 
No. As a ma tter of fact, ther
e were working Christians by 
my father. My father was a 
very likeable person. He was a very generous
 person. Everybody wants to work for him. My 
father was the type; it doesn™t ma tter you can be 
Jewish, you can be Christian, as long as you 
were a good ma n, a good worker, it didn™t ma ke a pr
eference. That was my father. Still, the 
Jewishness was there. But we
 were brought up different.

Were there any Germans living in Bedzin before the war?
 

 
Nathan: 
You see, when the Germans came in, most of them they came Post Deutsch (?), 
because that was ______(337), you know?

Nathan: 
Part of Ger many. But they weren™t so bad. There we re some , you know. They used to 
say wait, when Hitler come s, they will fish you out of the water. They used to say that. They 
were expecting, they want the Germans to come  in because this way they could take  everythi ng 

away from the Jews. You understand?
 
 
Anthony:  
Gerema nia Indenta (?) (356). This was Germ
an Indenta, as far as the Nazis were 
concerned. Now, what were you doing when the war began?
 
 
Nathan: 
When the war began?
 
 
Anthony: 
What were you doing on that day? Do you reme mber that day?
 
 
Nathan: 
Yes, I reme mb er. You see, you 
have moscatoni (?) ______ (348).
 
 
Anthony: 
You?  You were afraid
 of growing too tall?
 
 
Nathan: 
No, I started smoking very early.
 
 
Anthony: 
And you still grew to be tall?
 
 
Nathan: 
Yeah. My father noticed that I was pale
. I had just started smoking, I was young. We  
used to get our pay, everyday.
 
 
Anthony: 
So you worked?
 
 

Nathan: 
[Al l owance]. No, I didn™t work, allowance.
 
 
Anthony: 
You got an allowance?
 
 
Nathan: 
Allowance. I took the allowa
nce and I bought cigarettes.
 
 
Anthony: 
Secretly? 
 
 
Nathan: 
Secretly. See they built a house, a new hous
eŠin the front they didn™t finish it yet. 
When the war broke out, when they start to 
bomb, we were in the baseme nt. There was a 
neighbor there and everybody was smoking. My nei
ghbor says to my father, why don™t you give 
him a cigarette?  He gave me  a ciga
rette. He gave me  cigarettes, but  still I couldn™t smoke in front 
of hi m. So we moved in the big baseme nt 
because that building wasn™t finished, you know. 
Through, there was a hole and I went to the othe
r baseme nt and I smoked the cigarette. I never 
forget  t h at .
 
 
Anthony: 
So this is what you were doing when the Germans attacked?
 
 
Nathan: 
Yeah, when the neighbor told him. We were
 there. My father knew I smoke d before 
that. He caught me  once.
 
 
Anthony: 
Before the war he caught you?
 
 
Nathan: 
He caught me . I was sitting on the steps and 
I smoked. I have a mark even today. [He 
gave you such a smack]. Smack, he busted me . He was a good-natured guy.
 
 
Anthony: 
And he was bigger than you?  So you we re 
more afraid of your father catching you 
smoking than the German invasions.
 
 
 Nathan: 
Yes. So that™s what happened. The Germans we
re there three, four days they bombed. 
And I reme mber his name  was, I forgot the name
, I know the son, Vishop (? ). It was about five, 
six houses away; he was so happy. He wentaround and said now the German______ (384). My 

father didn™t say nothing he was a very ______ (
386). I never forget that. And the Polish Army 

used to be in our house, on the windows they
 put sand. They were looking for the Germans 
comi ng and where we live acro
ss was the castle. And around the 
castle we re big walls. That guy, 
that anti-Semite, he was happy because the Germ
ans were comi ng in. He went to the river, 
running around, he was drunk too, he was shot by
 the same  people, by the Polaks. And he 
crossed and went up from the ﬁboutaﬂ, no shelters, 
they used to call that. They shot him in the 
legs. That time  they used to have
 bullets, boom-boom bullets, you know the--?
 
 
Anthony: 
Yeah. Why di d they shot him?
 
 
Nathan: 
Because it used to be a curfew. They knew 
he was there, they know maybe he was a 
German. Our backyard was there, 
ne xt  t o  t h e  ri ve r .  The y  t o ok 
him and s hot him. His leg, busted 
like that. So one of my father™s 
neighbors said that his son whos
e name was Schlomo, his oldest 
son. You see, you have that, what you said before. 
I never forget that. After a few hours, he died. 
 
 
Anthony: 
From that bullet wound?
 
 
Nathan: 
I reme mber like today. After that in a few 
days the soldiers they took our house, the 
Polish soldiers ______ (432). After that in a few da
ys, the soldiers already took our house, they 
were Polish soldiers. They were
 ______. They came in like nothing.

 happy, the Germans came in, you know. There 
was some . ______(434). There were ve
ry little mobilized, mo torized.
 
 
Anthony: 
Very few tanks.
 
 
Nathan: 
Everything was on horses. I reme mber that 
like after they came in. My father  was 
drafted.
 
 
Anthony: 
Drafted in the Polish army?
 
 

Nathan:

him out. Onl y two brothers they took in the war.
 They went to the war. They came back after 
______ (447) the war. My father didn™t
 have time to give the uniform.
 
 
Anthony: 
Were you on the streets when the Germans ca me  into Bedzin?
 
 
Nathan: 
Yes. We  were talking German.
 
 
Anthony: 
And what was your impression when you saw these German sol diers?
 
 
Nathan: 
Well, we were very scared. I reme mber 
that. There was police, one I forgot theŠ
Schmitznik was his name. He used to shoot pe
ople like nothing, dogs. We had a dog we gave it 
away to somebody who used to deliver to us 
coal, you know. Not to be shot the dog, it was 

heartbreaking, so we gave
 it to some one in another town. We  
give it to these people who deliver 
us years and years, we know them. They used to 
deliver to us coal. I used to go once in a while 
with my friends to see it, go to ______ (462) that
™s about six kilome ters. We walked, we didn™t 

take the streetcars. We  we
nt, and I went to see him, and he ke
pt him in the stable, he even had 
little puppies. I used to go two or three times 
some ti me s a month. His name  was Azza. He was a 

beautiful animal, we love him. My
 mother didn™t give that dog ev
en to wash the ma id, she wash 
it. In the winter time she used to put him in
 the, how you call it, way back ______ (473) not to 
get a cold. She kept him near the furnace till he dries out.
 
 
Anthony: 
Your mother treated the dog like a baby?
 
 
Nathan: 
Why, he used to sleep with me .
 
 
Anthony: 
The dog slept with you?
 
 
Nathan: 
In my bed, I took him to bed. He was clean like a whistle. We  loved animals.
 
 
Anthony: 
What about your younger brother, Szmulek?
 
 

Nathan: 
He was a young kid. Let me explain you some th
ing of my brother. When the war broke 
out after that, you see, the bridge near Chivel
 (483) was one wooden br
idge, the second one of 
______ (484). Near us wa s a wooden bridge that 
was knocked off. So the y took me  a nd my 
father to rebuild the bridge, especially my 
father, was a powerful ma n, you knew that, no. During 
the war, the war started 
end of Augus t or Septembe
r, something like that.
 
 
Anthony: 
September 1
st
.
 
 
Nathan: 
Some thing like that I reme mber it was alrea
dy on the cool side. I worked very hard, you 
know, to build the bridge, and my father and all the Jews.
 
 
Anthony: 
The Germans ma de you do this?
 
 
Nathan: 
The Germans, yes, that™s who. My brother was very tall, he was a big guy.
 
 
Anthony: 
Szmulek?
 
 
Nathan: 
Yes. Four times they lost important ______ 
(502) from the German side that left 
everything open. I never forget th
at. We had a storm, about 12 f
eet of snow. Poland snow snows 
every day. And they took us, we didn™t have no 
more food, to clean the snow, and my brother 
went with me to get a little soup to bring in home.
 
 
Anthony: 
This is your brother Szmulek?
 
 
Nathan: 
Yes. He went to ﬁBointonﬂ (? ) (511). Boint
on is bitter in Poland. It was so cold that 
poor kid lost a piece of ear and a pi ece of nose and came back. Never go anymore because he 
was--. I was young too, but he was two years younge
r than me . I used to go the second shift, 
again three o™clock, used to come
 home with the trucks open, ve
ry cold. The truck, the Germans 
didn™t have gasoline, they used 
to burn it by coal and wood, the tr
uck used to go. And I used to 
go from 4:00 to mi dnight to bring home  another s
oup. My father had ulcers, very sick so they 
used to come , we used to know somebody, he used 
to be in the Jewish community, they started 
off Judenma ster that means in English--.
 
 
Anthony: 
The ﬁelderﬂ.
 

 
Nathan: 
No. Jewish leader. He was engineer; he was re
lated to us and he used to exchange and I 
used to go for my father because I was big. So, 
I ma de two shifts to bring other soup ho me . My 
father never went because  he had stomach pr
oblems, he had ulcers, he  was very sick.
 
 
Anthony: 
Your brother, you wanted 
to be a soccer player?
 
 
Nathan: 
Yeah.
 
 
Anthony: 
What did your brother, your
 younger brother want to be?
 
 
Nathan: 
Well, I don™t know. He wa s a big sport. We  used to tease hi m;  he was a boxer because 
he had a nose with no bone.
 
 
Anthony: 
No bone in his nose?
 
 
Nathan: 
No. We used to call hi m a boxer because he had a flat nose.
 
 
Anthony: 
But he wasn™t a boxer?
 
 
Nathan: 
No. He was young, we was just kidding around. 
You see the picture there, you see his 
nose looks normal. I used to kid him. I used to be proud of him to show all my friends. I took his 
nose to flatten it right to the face. So we used
 to call hi m boxer, he wa
s a very strong kid though. 
Yes, a very good kid.
 
 
Anthony: 
And he attended the same  school that you did?
 
 
Nathan: 
Yes.
 
 
Anthony: 
Two grades behind you?
 
 

Nathan: 
Yes.  We ll, that™s a different story too, w
ith my brother. You see, I was a guyŠthere 
was no strong ma n for me, I wasn™t scared
 of nobody, even when I was a young kid. Tough guy. 
You see, when the war break out they moved in a 
Jew from the next city to our place, and he 
used to be a traitor to the Jews. 
I used to go and treated it like th
e kid never had it so good. So he 
was a young kid and he used to go with him. Wh er
e he go, the German know too but we couldn™t 
do nothing about it. [Your brother] The younger brot
her. All the police know hi m. Because of 
that guy, that Jewish ﬁMoisha We xelmanﬂ (? ) (503).

 J e wish gangs. If a Christian did some thing a Jew 
would see, we fix them up. Our town was known 
for that. The Germans, when they come in, 
they were scared of us. When you move, they shoot you.
 
 
 
Tape I, Side B
 
 
Anthony:
 Of the gangs?  
 
 
Nathan: 
When he move d in

Anthony:
 The guy, yeah.
 

 
Nathan: 
My father was scared because I wasn't  scared of him. I was a hot temper. Many times I 
wish to beat  up my little brother.
 
 
Anthony:

Nathan: 
Yeah, because he was going with him. Pe
ople that know that are people that are 
thinking you are the same. You understand?  He di

Anthony:
 Right, right.
 
 
Nathan:
 [And he hid him.]
 
 
Anthony:
 With this Christian family in the countryside.
 
 
Nathan: 
No, no, so far he was with me . I took him to the shop. [He took him to the shop and he 
says stay he re. Stay there and don't move because
 he had the feeling the Germans will take him.] 
No, the Germans,-- [The Jewish police.]
 
 
Anthony:
 The Jewish police would go after the traitor?
 
 
Nathan: 
Yeah, the one that took him.
 

 
Anthony:
 And they would take your brot
her if he was close to him?
 
 
Nathan: 
They was scared because-- [Maybe he knew too mu ch. So he took him in his shop, in 
the shop and he says---] No, the policeman becau
se my uncle, my father's brother, he was a 
doorma n there as a policeman too. And he got th
e keys. So only he know and I know-- [that your 
little brother is there, safe ] Yeah. But he was closed up.

No, he didn't know that.
 
 
Anthony:
 He just thought he was interesting?
 
 
Nathan: 
He was very good to him;  he gave him ev
erything. You understand he got--? My father, 
he got-- was scared of him too, especially now. 
We didn't like it and we went to us because 
before the wa r, they couldn't afford it, to move
 into us. You understand my point?  So after he got 
tired, I took to his chauffeur th

Nathan: 
Well, I do not reme mber it as--
 
 
Anthony:
 Was it after your bar mitzvah?
 
 
Nathan: 
No. I was-- had nobody. That was before, a fe
w mo nths before, after Henri and I had 
the thing in the house. We didn't ma ke thi

know. Private, you know.
 
 
Anthony:
 Do you reme mber whether it was

Nathan: 
Was in the fall time.
 
 
Anthony:
 Fall?
 
 
Nathan: 
Yes.
 
 
Anthony:
 A year after the Germans?
 
 

Nathan: 
A year or two years, I do not reme mber
 exactly. I think it 
was a year or two.
 
 
Anthony: 
Was there a ghetto?
 
 
Nathan: 
No, it wasn™t yet in a ghetto yet. We  went after to the ghetto.
 
 
Anthony: 
So, this was before--?
 
 
Nathan:

Nathan: 
In the corner, they took him.
 
 
Anthony:

ter the occupation?
 
 
Nathan: 
Maybe a year or two, I don't know. No longer th
an a year or two. A year ma ybe or two 
or something like that. I do not--.
 
 
Anthony: 
So the Jewish police took him away and 
you never saw him aga i n?  You never found 
out what happened?
 
 
Nathan: 
So, I went with my mother and we brought  him soup. He was on the third floor. We  
took a big pot of soup and my mother was a 
very tough woma n. She could walk all over and 
nobody recognize her. She used to go all the German
 stores and buy. We  never were--. So I, with 
my mother, went--that wa s in ______ (82). I reme
mber that wa s a house that they built a big 
building for the Jewish, that the Jewish co
mmunity built for orphans, Jewish orphans.______ 
(84) they used to call that in 
Polish. He was on the fourth floor.
 
 
Anthony: 
Your brother?
 
 

Nathan: 
Yeah. I know and we gave it to some body--  My mo ther could manage, she says give it 
to my son, this soup with a big pot. She put a rope
 so he could slide it out. But he didn't . We  
were sure that some body would ta
ke him out, you know. After a fe
w days, they send him out and 
that's it.
 
 
Anthony: 
Who sent him out?
 
 
Nathan: 
The Jews. The Jews , the Jews were supposed to get so ma ny Jews to go to 
concentration camp or thing or--
 
 
Anthony: 
So he was sent to a camp?
 
 
Nathan: 
For some body else. That™s what they used to do. [In place of some body else, they gave 
them hi m. ] You understand?
 
 
Anthony: 
Yes, yes.
 
 
Nathan: 
That was the excuse, you understand?
 
 
Anthony: 
You don't know which camp?
 
 
Nathan: 
Was-- never survived. We  don't know nothing 
about it. Nobody knows where they send 
out the Jews, where they go, Auschwitz or 
Birkenau, or Dachau, nobody knows. Mostly we 
know -- nobody knew that there's existing an Auschwitz. They used to -- in the beginning they 

used to open up concentration camps in Poland 
like ______ (99), a private camp. Used to go for 
a year, two; they used to come 
home. So we were thinking with him it would be time -- be with 
us. But nothing.
 
 
Anthony: 
Whatever happened to the tr
aitor?  The one who you were 
afraid of, your father was 
afraid of?
 
 
Nathan: 
What happened--. We ll, they killed him, the Germans killed him.
 
 

Anthony: 
The Germans killed the traitor?
 
 
Nathan: 
Yeah, because they were scared of him too. 
The German was scared of him. They took 
him -- that's why -- you know mostly the Jewish
 policemen was working with some  German 
police, you understand. That's what happened.
 
 
Anthony: 
The Jewish gangs didn't go after him?
 
 
Nathan: 
They couldn't, they couldn't. He was too pow
erful. He was so rich, he has everything. 
Rich fa mily, Jewish fami ly, get used to dema
nd somebody to make business with, was a traitor.
 
 
Anthony: 
What happened to your school after 
the Germans came in to Bedzin?
 
 
Nathan: 
We didn't have no schools no more, nothing.
 
 
Anthony: 
No more schools. Closed down?
 
 
Nathan: 
Everything was finished. There was no schools.
 We  had nothing to eat, we didn't have 
money, couldn't buy nothing at the beginning.
 
 
Anthony: 
What other changes occurred when the Ge
rmans came in?  School was closed, right?  
What else happened?
 
 
Nathan: 
Nothing. The Jews didn't work. You survived 
with whatever you had. They said to the 
Polaks, you got things, diamond. [They didn't send
 you out from the house there? ] We ll, they 
used to take us for work and go outside, you know.
 
 
Anthony: 
To work?
 
 
Nathan: 
To work and we used to get-- Then after fi
ve, six mo nths, we used to get ration bread, 
starving, you know. We  had nothi
ng, had to serve for food.
 
 

Anthony: 
You continued to live in your house?
 
 
Nathan: 
Yeah.
 
 
Anthony: 
What kind of work did you do?
 
 
Nathan: 
I used to work with my father. In an
 SS sonder ______ (122). I me an all the Jews, 
mostly tradesme n used to work there for th
e SS sonderval ______, they used to call that.
 
 
Anthony: 
You me ntioned earlier, you 
had to repair a bridge?
 
 
Nathan: 
Yeah.
 
 
Anthony: 
What other kind of work did they have you do?
 
 
Nathan: 
Well, after that, till--I mean the Germans se
ttle, there was not much to do. My father 
used to work with some body _______(12) Pharmacy, far away in the country road, we used to 
go with ______ (130). They used to sell under the ta
ble; they used to di
g potatoes for food. He 
was doing it for some body. He had guts; my father di
dn't want to do it but he used to work for 

my father. He used to be a worker; he worked 
for that guy. He got the gu
ts because this was far 
away in the country. Nobody knew him and he went th
ere to work so they used to share him with 
the potatoes and the flowers and that's how they
 how died, they had nothing. Then there's the 
story with the cattles. My
 mother and all the brothers and 
sisters, they come  up in our house.
 
 
Anthony: 
Your mother's  brothers and sisters?
 
 
Nathan: 
No, no. On my father's  side. They had m
oney, plenty of money. We bought a horse. My 
mother went up to -- my little brother, she we
nt into the country. Th
ey killed her cattle, 
everything, used to bring it into
 the house in the beginning so I 
reme mbe r  right now. They took 
away the horse after mo nths; they took away th
e horse and don't me ntion that to the Germans 
because we need a permit already. We had a perm
it but they took it away. I reme mber like today, 
they took my brother; they went to the rail
road. That was in S______ (120), I think and they 
came by railroad. My mother Š they took my little 
brothe r and the Germans 
beat the hell out of 

him. He was all busted up. [That was before th
ey took him away.] Yeah, before they took him 
away. I'm jumping from one to--.
 
 
Anthony: 
But this time, it was the Germans that beat him up?
 
 
Nathan: 
Beat him up on the train.
 
 
Anthony: 
When he was with your mother?
 
 
Nathan: 
With my mother.
 
 
Anthony: 
But they didn't touch your mother?
 
 
Nathan: 
I do not reme mber. But he was a big guy too at
 that time. He was a little-- but he was a 
big guy. They beat him up so badly; he was a
ll ye llow his head, his face. They took away 
everything. They took away the horse and the wa
gon. Then they stopped. I have to work with 
this, I don't reme mber exactly things. That's
 why I'm jumping from before to behind.
 
 
Anthony: 
That™s okay. As you reme mber, just --.
 
 
Nathan: 
Yeah. That's what I st ill reme mber. But 
anyway-- Then I used to work, that who 
worked in the SS sonder--- (164), they took him aw
ay. Every month they used to take away Jews 
because we were saved because we worked 
for that German governme nt, ma nufacturing. But 
then, after that, th
ey open up a ghetto.
 
 
Anthony: 
In Bedzin?
 
 
Nathan: 
Bedzin. Near to us, ﬁKomyunkiﬂ (?) (170), 
ma ke a ghetto, Komyunki. That was -- they 
took away all the houses from the Polish coal mi ne
rs. They used to have all the same  houses 
from brick, nice homes. They took all the remaini
ng Jewish, what rema ined, and we worked for -
- put in the ghetto.
 
 

Anthony: 
So you had to move out of your house and into one of these coal mi ners' houses?
 
 
Nathan:

Is this before or after 
your brother was taken away?
 
 
Nathan: 
Aft e r my brother was taken away.
 
 
Anthony: 
It was after your br
other was taken away?
 
 
Nathan: 
I was only alone. But after that, when they 
opened up the ghetto, we hide our mother. 
They ma ke- -  they call all the Jews to go out 
and they selected. We  
were worried about my 
mother and we build in the attic, double wall. So 
we hide my mother and I went with my father. 
We didn't worry because we 
got the papers and I was--.
 
 

Anthony: 
Your mother didn™t have a pass?
 
 
Nathan: 
Wome n didn't have a pass, no. So we hide my 
mother and I went with my fa ther. They 
took away my father from me and they let me out.
 
 
Anthony: 
What happened to your father?
 
 
Nathan: 
They took him away.
 
 
Anthony: 
This was right after the ghetto was opened?   
 
 
Nathan: 
Yeah.

Many times they took it when they took a ______, when
 
you showed where you work, they let

Well, you were there when they took your father?
 
 
Nathan:

Anthony: 
You were with him.
 
 
Nathan: 
I went there. They closed us up.
 

 
Anthony: 
This is while you were walking home?
 
 
Nathan: 
Yeah, they let you out. They check what you'
re doing. They ask you-- they interrogate 
you. They put my father one side; they put me  on other side.
 
 
Anthony: 
The Germans did this?
 
 
Nathan: 
Yes, and I lost my father.
 
 
Anthony: 
You don't know whether he was put on a transport?
 
 
Nathan: 
On a transport, sure. They took him away, that™s all.
 
 
Anthony: 
So now, it's just you and your mother?
 
 
Nathan: 
Me and my mother.
 
 
Anthony: 
During these months, were you 
forced to wear armbands?
 
 
Nathan: 
Yeah, we were all the time , Jewish.
 
 
Anthony: 
Jewish, the star.
 
 
Nathan: 
Yeah. I had a police hat only when I was to go there.
 
 
Anthony: ﬁ
Astellajelaﬂ (?)(216)?
 
 
Nathan: 
Yuda, yes. We  used to always wear that. My
 mother was a very gutsy woma n. She used 
to get out from the ghetto. Dress up and everything.
 

 
Anthony: 
She would leave the ghetto?
 
 
Nathan: 
Yes. She would ______ the stores to shop and 
everything. I was awfully scared. I used 
to scream at her. I didn™t want to lose he
r early. She used to go th
ere was no ___ (224).  I 
reme mber once she brought in a rabbit, brough
t it up and everything. We  didn't have rabbit 
before but you know--.
 
 
Anthony: 
She bought a rabbit in the market?
 
 
Nathan: 
I reme mber like it was-- my mother was a modern woma n. She worked on fish, 
everything, vegetables. She want 
to sneak out and I didn't know. My father, he was scared but 
she didn't say nothing. She just ______ and to go
. We  didn't have to worry. We  thought we 
worked for German. We  wouldn't have to worry, 
come s a Jewish word like that. Yiddish. As a 
ma tter of fac t , people, my mother, when the Germ
ans come  i n see my father was a big, powerful 
guy. My father was a big chicken. He  don't know what ______ ( 237)  you understand what I 
mean?  I think he was such a good chicken was becau
se my mother, as soon as German come  in, 
used to, after shul--
 
 
Anthony: 
The Germans would come  to the--?
 
 
Nathan: 
No, no they said to come  in the district iden
tification. Christians or Jews. We  went, the 
office was there in the castle that was not far from
 us and my mother says for us to change the 
name s. Beca use our names were German, change  completely to Polish name  and go a nother 
town. My father didn't want to because his sist
ers and brothers and mother you know. My mother 
want to go.
 
 
Anthony: 
So your mother wanted you to get fals
e ID's and get Christian name s and go 
some where else?
 
 
Nathan: 
Yeah, because we didn't have to worry, co
me s out a Yiddish word, because we didn't 
know how to talk in Yiddish. Even the Christians and the Jews said that. Says why don't you do 
that?  My father was a chicken. We  didn't have to worry because you know most Jewish in our 
town, were mostly, all talked Yiddish to ev
erybody. Understand what I 
mean?  That's  why my 
mother used to get ma d at my father when he used to come  visit my grandma, she use d to throw 

us the fish in a counter.
 

 
Anthony: 
About your mother?
 
 
Nathan: 
It was really-- No, for the kids. My fath
er was touched, this 
is ______(260). Because 
we didn't know how to talk in Yiddish. First ofall, we would have ma jority, all friends are 
Christians. We were brought up 
different. You understand where I'm jumping from one into 
another with our stories. [So your 
father was afraid to have fals
e papers? ] He didn't wa nt to do 
that because we would--especiallyŠ
 
 
Anthony: 
So your mother was the gutsy one in the fa mily?
 
 
Nathan: 
Yeah, well, she-- Let me  explain you so
me thing. Even now, I'm Jewish but nobody 
takes me for Jewish, even in this country. Taken for Italian or British or  Fr ench. Weren't any 

type Jewish, the way we were brought up, understa
nd?  [You could mi ngle with the rest of the 
Christians.] Yes, so that's  why everybody says
, why don't you do that?  My father didn't want. I 

bet you, we would survive. My mot her was a ve
ry gutsy woma n, very intelligent, very open-
mi nded. So was my father-- [And you had 
good friends.] We  had good friends too.
 
 
Anthony: 
You me ntioned you had Christian frie
nds?  Did they help in any way?
 
 
Nathan: 
Well, some  of them did. Some , they we re scared too. This is not so easy.
 
 
Anthony: 
I know but I mean you would have been ab
le to get false ID's from a friend?
 
 
Nathan: 
Yes because we  didn't have no papers there. They just ask you and you give  them the 
name . Nothing, you don't have to show nothing. They give you the ID's, the Germans. So there 

was no problems because we find out before. My mo
ther went to do it-- she find out do you need 
papers?  Certificate?--nothing. You go there, you 
just give your name  and they give you 
identification card. [Like the British 
did in ______ (286)]. You understand me ?
 
 
Anthony: 
Now after you moved into the ghetto, would 
this have been possible? Because once 
you're in the ghetto, you're Jewish.
 
 
Nathan: 
We were Jewish, sure. I mean even before the ghetto, we were Jewish. 
 

 
Anthony: 
I know, but I mean once you're in the ghett
o, the Germans know that you're Jewish.
 
 
Nathan: 
Yeah, want to go out, you have to--; only the Je
ws were there, there were no Christians 
because they took all the community was the 
coal mi ners' community. Was one-family home s 
and they had a card that issue from the coal mi ne
rs. Brick houses, nice, beautiful section for the 
coal mi ners what Goldman (295) give it to them. 
They were over there with the ghetto. But then 
I still hate myself, ‚til today, b
ecause ma ybe my mother would su
rvive and I didn't let it. [When 
they took you out from t he ghetto, at the end.] 
From the ghetto, when they start to c______ (301) 
everybody, they used to be Judenrei
n. Judenrein were the killers of
 the Jews, finishing the last 
Jews. We were the last  Jews; they used to work 
most of them. Some , what they call, jobs. So my 
mother end up in the attic. I and my father 
ma ke a double wall with some body else. Was hot, 
always was hot, very hot summer. We had a neig
hbor had a factory, who was in our house. The 
neighbor called that-- took the family in those on
e-family homes, in the ghetto. But that him, he 
had a factory from chocolate. The Ge rman took it over, and he was as a forema n there. He was 
always two, three deep sort of ba
skets with large basket with choc
olate. He wasn't  allowed but he 
was smuggl ed out. Even was his factory but the 
Germans, you know, took over. So him and me  
and my mother were there, we brought the ch
ocolate up. No water, nothing. I was hiding with 
my mother. The other one, they couldn't ma ke it,
 they went out. My mother didn't. Was so 
narrow, alone. [The others surrendered.] The othe
rs surrendered; I couldn't  see my mo ther. We  
ate chocol ate-- (328). I was sitt
ing in my mother's lap and I c
ouldn't see anymore. I couldn't see 
my mother get shot to death. So
 I start to scream. Took her out--
 
 
Anthony: 
You took your mother out?
 
 
Nathan: 
Yeah. She didn't  want to go. That's  
how it clears up that they took us.
 
 
Anthony: 
So they caught you in the 
street when you went out?
 
 
Nathan: 
Yeah, they didn't  shoot us but they took us
, the German, and se nt us out. I was sitting 
on my mother's lap, on her feet for two weeks.
 
 
Anthony: 
When you were hiding?
 
 
Nathan: 
It was so hot.   [______ (339) because  at 
the end they raised everybody.] I am still 
guilty. When they took us on the train--.
 

 
Anthony: 
So they put you and your mother--?
 
 
Nathan: 
My mother was a good-looking woma n.
 
 
Anthony: 
I can see.
 
 
Nathan: 
She took the Ge rman on the train some thing. He asked do you know how to take people 
and at night was the cattle bars
, you know. Wa s s o much open. My 
mother says to me, she says 
come  we go first. I want to ______ (347)
. I didn't let her, from the train.
 
 
Anthony: 
So you were in a cattle car?
 
 
Nathan: 
Yeah.
 
 
Anthony: 
And you and your mother were in the same  wagon?
 
 
Nathan: 
Yeah. We  were all covered up and he told her, mother, where we  go. [The German] 
Yes, the SS ma n. My mother had three kids but 
she look like a young girl. My mother says to 
me , we would all be better off. (356) I didn't 
believe that. I didn't  know too much about it, 
nobody knows where we go. I didn't let her jump.
 
 
Anthony: 
You didn't let her jump?
 
 
Nathan: 
No.
 
 
Anthony: 
From the moving train?
 
 
Nathan: 
The moving train because it sits so fast and slow down. She was ready. I was so-- the 
Germans, they stay on the-- [Railr
oad]. You know between the trains.
 
 

Anthony: 
She would have done this at night?
 
 
Nathan: 
At night, yeah. It were at 
night, she was ready. I said I couldn't see how to jump. ‚Til 
today, I eat my life out. I eat my life out because 
I took her out from the attic. I di dn't let her 
jump. She was a very powerful woman, and I neve
r forgive myself. When it came to Auschwitz 
selection,took my mother one 
side, took me  from other side
. They ask me , what's your 
profession?  So I says, I'm carpenter. Ho
w old you are?  Twenty-four. I wasn't  24.
 
 
Anthony: 
How old were you then?
 
 
Nathan: 
Fourteen, 13, some thing like that. 
 It was 1943, they took us away.
 
 
Anthony: 
1943 when you went to--
 
 
Nathan:

Anthony: 
Do you reme mber what time  of the year?
 
 
Nathan: 
Well, it was summer, between June, July, 
August, some thing. It was very hot. I 
reme mber because the corn was high. I never forget
 I look on the little br ick house. I never forget 
that till today. They took a priest
, was near there in the corn. Th

shot him with a bullet. A priest, a Polish priest.
 
 
Anthony:

Anthony: 
In the attic, hiding. Y
ou could see this--?
 
 
Nathan: 
Yeah. My mot her used to go ______(387). The corn was high so was the end of the 
summer, mu st have been August. Because I reme mber
 the corn was already nice and tall, so that 
must be August. July or August, was very hot. 
My mother want to run away too; go during the 

night, and I didn't let her. She said, let's go and 
I didn't let her. I saw ne
xt that he was dying. A 
young guy, about 20, 22. They didn't tie him up, t hey just

Yeah, we were only Jews in Birkenau. 
We were sleeping about 15 or 20 on wood, 
nothing. At night, when they sleep, 
I jump in and I stole a blanket.

Nathan: 
From those, from the SS--.
 
 
Anthony: 
From the SS?
 
 
Nathan: 
Yeah, the Jewish kapo. The headma n, they had their own office, everything by 
themselves. They were living like ki

 it to my uncle, my father's brother. I 
find him a needle even with thread inside it, 
and I steal it. Nobody coul

Yes. So he told me that and it was clean
. To me, he will kill you. I says don't worry 
about it. I wa s a kid. There was no water. I finally

You were a devil but you were in hell?
 
 
Nathan: 
Yes, when I came  in, I didn't eat for four, fi

they told me, you will eat after that, they were 
right. But I didn't eat. With me was sleeping a gu

I forget that. They had manufacturers; a pape

them. He us ed to call me father. I wa s a kid. I used
 to carry everything back and give it to him to 
eat it. He looks at me  and says kid, go and eat. So
 I eat. I was a devil, ok
ay. But after that, they 
used to ma ke an inspection in concentration w
ith selecting people. One morning I know I never 
find anymor e my uncles. They took them a way.
 
 
Anthony: 
They disappeared?
 
 
Nathan: 
Disappeared, not far away was a cremator
ium. They build this crematorium in 
Birkenau. You see the smoke and fire, terrible. 
You get used to it, don't even cry. Making just, 
just to say nothing, the guard forget 
the next day. You have to look for life.
 

 
Anthony: 
Did you have to work?
 
 
Nathan: 
Well, I used to-- before I come  to that. When
 they ma ke to selection, they came  to our 
bunk, they select me . You see I was always a sk
inny kid, I was always skinny. I was skinny until 
a few years ago; I was very skinny. So they us
ed to call the skinny me n, muscleme n. But I saw 
they need tailors. So they ask who is tailor. So 
they take me  to work and transfer some one else. 
Was very fast in those days. I reme mber some t hing 
but I go back after that. So I say, I finish and 
then I come to other thing, I reme mb er something.
 
 
Anthony: 
Okay.
 
 
Nathan: 
With tailors, I see they select guys no scars,
 nothing. You had little bit, they wouldn't 
take you. Big guys, I was big but not big like they 
are. Of course, I was 
skinny but-- We stay 
there naked and near the clothes,
 we still had private clothes. 
Only ma rk it down with red, red 
ma rk, political prisoner, understand? We put the su
its on the side and we stay naked. So they 
selected some body likes. So I saw from 50 or 6
0, they pull out one a

healthy guys. So when I saw one who goes this
 side and the other guys
, I saw, better-looking 
guys on the other side. I says to myself, I 
______(560). I see some body went to the red side, I 

grab my poc kets, and I have nothing. I 
went to the other guys. I didn't pass--
 
 
Anthony: 
You joined them?
 
 
Nathan: 
Joined them. Maybe I was lucky to join them
. But I didn't know how to hold a needle in 
my life. But anyway, when I joined them, they pu
t us in a barrack and I suffered, three days, four 
days. They bring water and a piece of bread. As 
soon as the bread come s out, was like a piece of 
glue. But one day, two days, three days, four days,they notice us. Each day I says what the heck 
I got here?  I was ready to jump the block and go 
on back. I wait finally, eight days or nine days, 
or some thing like that, they let us out. They give 
us fresh clothes, not to wear it and we  ma rching 
to shave and wash and put us to showers. I was 
still in Birkenau because not far away was the 
crematorium. Nothing, they shave us, shower and s
till those clothes what they gave to us, they 
throw it away. It was smelling from 
disinfection; they give us fresh clothes. After that, we stay 
there, we stay almost two days there, in the 
barrack there. But I never forget that. Everybody was 
sleeping tired. I was the youngest on
e. I woke up when they steam 
the water, they boil it, and I 
was looking for good luck. What I find, leaves
 of tobacco and I was smoking already.
 
 
Anthony: 
Smoking again?
 

 
Nathan: 
Sure. I took paper and find it when I pass out. I 
give it. I didn't know how to hide it for 
that they would give anything 
for it, diamonds, anything you wante
d. But we were there, we had 
nothing. So I find it and I hold it. K
now something?  When they tran
sferred us to Auschwitz after 
that; I got that tobacco 
to Auschwitz. If they cat
ch me , they kill me . Bi
g bones of tobacco, that 
high. I put it a stripper, 
I put it around. I came to 
Auschwitz with tobacco.

let's go in the field and get some  potatoes. It wa
s the end of the summer, a nd ma ybe they put it 
out the potato. We  see if we can find some thing 
in the ground. I never forget that, and I tell you 
why. We  took potatoes, and we took a live lim

throwing the potatoes in the lime and they were
 boiling and they were cooked. I never forget 
that. They shot a wild wolf, the German takes the rifle and he shoots. Pick up the wolf.

Nathan: 
Yeah. They started to eat, but I didn't eat it.
 I couldn't say that. I would never believe 
that in my life. I ate the pot
atoes and everything but I was a 
mess. The SS men, they were 
starving too. They had too much to ______. Mostly
 the SS me n, they were not Germans. They 
were Yugoslavs, Czechoslovaks, Slovaks mostly, Serbian, Croats, were mostly SS me n. The next 

day we used to go on other jobs, some thing like th
at, but on the end they had so much confidence 
in us that I reme mber once I was working not fa

of the town. The SS ma n says you want to go for 
a swim?  Put everything. When we start to study

Nathan: 
Give them diamonds, give them mone y.
 
 
Anthony: 
These are the diamonds that you had found?
 
 
Nathan: 
Yes, we give them plenty and they prepare 
us. Because we told th

you get caught. Because we weren't sure, they were Polaks. You understand what I mean?  So we 
give them plenty. They told us exactly where th
ere was a haystack one pl ace, they woul d prepare 
everything. There were three bicy

Anthony: 
The Czechoslovakian resistance?
 
 
Nathan: 
No, no. There were lots of resistance 
there. They would take to England.
 
 
Anthony: 
Nobody wanted you?
 
 
Nathan: 
They didn't trust us. We  ha d a very hard time.
  [We  have to ma ke sure that they were 
really ready.]
 
 

Anthony: 
Who they were?
 
 
Nathan: 
We suffered plenty. Once you tasted out. Then
 they had to go in and get you. But after

But which underground?
 
 
Nathan: 
From P______ (101).
 
 
Anthony: 
So the Ukrainian?  These were Ukrainians?
 
 
Nathan: 
There were every kind of races. We  couldn't talk too much because you say one word, 
I'm tired, that's it. They say nothing. They take
 you aside that night, 
they get you a bullet and 
that's it. It's a tough situation. That's why I'
m wor r ied about the United States, too. [No, they 
wouldn't, not now.]
 
 

Anthony: 
So basically, you're doing the same  kind of work you did
 
before?  They'r e putting you 
to work?
 
 
Nathan: 
Who do?
 
 
Anthony: 
The Resistance.
 
 
Nathan: 
Yeah and finally and slowly we used to
 be there and you know some thing; Ge rman 
knew about it, they couldn't get in there because 
we were on the trees and all over. We go slow 
and we had contact with the Allies and some ti
mes they used to drop food, you know. Like that, 
we meet with the Russians and then we went with the Russians.
 
 
Anthony: 
When did you meet with the Russians?
 
 
Nathan: 
I never heard yet there was a father and 
son. We  crossed a ditch in the underground, 
murdered. We left that boy there 
without a canteen. Wa sn't  s o eas
y a life but then we slowly 
were-- meet with the Russians. I join 
with the Russians then after that.
 
 
Anthony: 
When did the Russians come ?
 
 
Nathan: 
Forty-four, or '45.
 
 
Anthony: 
Wi nter?
 
 
Nathan: 
Was on the cold side still.
 
 
Anthony: 
There was snow?
 
 
Nathan: 
Snow, as a ma t t er of fact, I reme mber fi rst I 
went  with them after I was just crossing the 
Vistula River was the shooting-ou
t, you know. We didn't expect that
. From there, I join with 
them. I used to fight with them. From there, th
ere were two parties from
 Krakow. I didn't just-- 
in the army and we went away from them
, went to Krakow. It was snowing like hell.
 

 
Anthony: 
You went to Krakow?
 
 
Nathan: 
Yeah, to Krakow, I went, yeah.
 
 
Anthony: 
But not ri ght away? This was after the Germans--?
 
 
Nathan: 
No, wait a mi nute. I was in Krakow, that's right.
 
 
Anthony: 
This was after the Germans were driven back?
 
 
Nathan: 
Yeah, I was in Krakow.
 
 
Anthony: 
So this was in 1945?
 
 
Nathan: 
No, wait a mi nute. From then on, I didn't -- 
from the underground when I joined it, I 
went back to Auschwitz.
 
 
Anthony: 
You went back to Auschwitz?
 
 
Nathan: 
That's the only thing I forget. Reme mber th
e kids?  Yeah, I was getting too far away. 
[That's whe n you ran away from the concentrationcamp.] Yeah and I went 
back to Birkenau and 
I brought the two young kids. I risked my life for them. It was too far out.
 
 
Anthony: 
You escaped fr om Auschwitz and th
en you went back into the camp?
 
 
Nathan: 
Was already a thing because 
there was not any Germans.
 
 
Anthony: 
After the Germans left , so this was when?
 
 

Nathan: 
Then the Germans, meet again with the 
Germans. I got two boys. [ I reme mber the 
story he told me . He went back to Au
schwitz to look for some thing. Then --].
 
 
Anthony: 
That's  the mo ney that you had hid in the ground?
 
 
Nathan: 
Yeah but-- [But he couldn't find it. Then
 you left it and as you're comi ng along, you 
find two little kids alone.] The Ger ma n come  
out watching. [The German c a me  and you were 
afraid but they let you go. Th
ey didn't  --.] They didn't know
 because they thought I was 
______(146). They said why I do that?  I said that's
 how they teach us in concentration camp. 
They didn't know that, they were the We hr macht. 
[They were regular soldiers, they were not SS.] 
Regular soldiers, yeah. [Nothing happened a
nd you left.] Nothing 
happened, nothing left.
 
 
Anthony: 
So you found these two children and what did you do?
 
 
Nathan: 
We took them out. We left them, I think, 
in Auschwitz, in the city or with the 
Um______ ( 152), I don't reme mber. Anyway, we  left them some where safely after the 

concentration camp, bec a use the war was still--  I 
reme mber one thing. Some of the m used to be 
ma d because they left and I came with them. He
 was a little bit olde r fellow, was a tough guy and 
he came with me. He says I'm going with you an
d take the kids. They couldn't walk. We took a 
piece of wood, I don't reme mber from where we got
 the rope or some thing, and we pulled them. 
They were sitting up, ______(159); nine years ol
d or some thing like eight, you know. They were 
youngsters. We left them out of them-- [Some of 
them, they didn't want to be responsible for 
those two kids but how can you leave two kids 
like that? That™s where you left them, was 
 
some --] Some where around Auschwitz there, I don™
t reme mber where around it. At the town, we 
have to leave it because when we saw the Germ
ans around there with the horses, we didn't know 
what the heck was going on. We ll, I'm jumping fro
m one end to the other one; it's a very tough 
situation. I don't re me mb er exactly. Then I reme mb
er there were two brothers from Kra kow. We  
went in a farm; we took two horses and a horse 
wa gon. After we meet with the Russians, I went 
back to Auschwitz. I never forget that. We nt b
ack to Auschwitz, I went to the ma gazine and I 
took two bases of socks, German ar my socks and put it in.
 
 
Anthony: 
The Russians let you do this?
 
 
Nathan: 
What would the Russian ______ (177). [Especi
ally with the partisans on the Russian 
side.]
 
 

Anthony: 
So they didn't need the socks for themselves?
 
 
Nathan: 
Look at that.
 
 
Anthony: 
So they considered you a partisan?
 
 
Nathan: 
Yeah, but afterward, we were dismantled. 
 Some  we nt home, some  joined them.
 
 
Anthony: 
Were you a partisan-- Were you with the 
Polish resistance or  the Czechoslovakian?
 
 
Nathan: 
Was lots of nationalities.
 
 
Anthony: 
So there was no one unit?
 
 
Nathan: 
No, no, there wa s lots of nationalities. Ther
e wasn't  one nationality. You can't  ask too 
much in a situation like that. You mu st be kidd
ing; they'r e scared to death. You can open up your 
mi nd; you know you're comi ng home. I was wishi
ng when I was there, I was wishing that I 
would go back to concentration camp. You believe that?
 
 
Anthony: 
Sure.
 
 
Nathan: 
You believe that, hey?
 
 
Anthony: 
That you wouldn't want to go back to concentration camp?
 
 
Nathan: 
Well, what we went through with the unde
rground army, we ca n talk. Be very careful 
what you say. I never forget that. When some bo
dy says, I'm tired; they 
don't say nothing. They 
ask you out, they put you in ______ (191) your head, that's it.
 
 
Anthony: 
The underground?
 
 

Nathan: 
That's right, because they didn't trust you.
 
 
Anthony: 
So you were more afraid with the und
erground than you were with the Germans?
 
 
Nathan: 
That's right. [To obey blindly.] Can't sa y nothing.
 
 
Anthony: 
So you deserted them?
 
 
Nathan: 
No, we didn't. Went together 
to the last mo ment, ‚til we met together with the Russian 
army. Then we went out with the Russian army for 
a while over there. Then
 finally, I went to the 
Russian, we went to the country with the Russian
 and we took the stocking what the two brought 
us-- [socks] and went to Cracow. Socks, I want to
 say, right. [Men's  socks.] I was there about six, 
seven days, was already free from 
the Nazi. I took the bale and 
I was already ma rket. [Something 
to sell.] Yeah, I had plenty of money. Then I we
nt with the Russians. I was going with them back 
to them. From them I us ed to go onto my city, Bedzin. You know how I went, for because 

everything was discouraged. Once in a while, I used
 to go on with the engine, railroad engine, 
turn the engine because I had with the gun and everythi ng. They let me . I arrive d in our town 

through Um______ (213). I had plenty money with me
. [But you were dismissal already by the 
Russian army, no? ] Yeah, they let us go and I neve
r forget I arrive in my town, mi dnight, after 
mi dnight. I couldn't recognize our city. Not in th
e ghetto, but where we used to live. They 
destroy whole the town, everything and one fa mily
 home for the Germans. I say, am I in my 
town?  Then I reme mber there was a ______, 
you know those things that take water?
 
 
Anthony: 
A water pump.
 
 
Nathan: 
A water pump.
 
 
Anthony: 
A well.
 
 
Nathan: 
A well. I go in there and I says I'm home. I 
go to the well. As I pump by the well, who I 
meet, was still there, how you call that?  [Curfew?
] Curfew, I go to the pu mp, I met the son, my 
mother's , she was the, electrician, mi dwife a
ttic. ______ (228) And I thought who I am and I ask 
him where is the other electrician, the nei

yes, that's it. It's further up. They didn't  
touch it. ______ by the river, they ma ke all one-

Then after I met, I went to my friend. I had a 
friend, really a friend. 
We  we re better than 
brothers. Christian. He say I was to work here for 
the United States, classi
fied work for after. I 
couldn't write to Poland, it wasn't  allowed. Then
 it was counted in the beginning. [So you lost 
contact with him. ] So I lost cont
act with him. After I left  it and
-- So I wrote to Poland, to my 
friends. I said to my wife, if he doesn't answer
 it, he's dead. His brot
her answer it and he was 
dead. He died in '55. My age, a good friend. Then in our town, I me t-- was four Jews. I me t that 
guy what was here in United States when I was 
living a few days by my friend's. That was funny. 
His mother says I never forgot that. I came at 
night and she was with the candle. They didn't 
have lights. She saw me  and she says, she didn't m
eant it, she says, you're still living?  [She didn't 
mean it. She was--] Didn't mean it, we grew up 
together. My fr iend was there and he wa s already 
the police in our town. I stayed 
with them and I got bread from the Russians. I brought it home; 
they were starving; they had nothing. So I stayed 
four or five days. After that when I'm-- I meant 

my Jewish enemy now a bout six, seven Jews were
 on the radio. They says
 starting it, all this, 
Poland star t with drafts ri ght away. But star ting 
still angels (267) with concentration camp. I was 
wounded too. At that time  too, I wa s wounded.
 
 
Anthony: 
While you were in the resistance?
 
 
Nathan: 
Yeah. I was wounded. I said it wasn't  him that we  were-- Starting with all the Jews 
were in concentration camp, they shouldn't draft them into the army. I, like a stupid boy, was 

alone. I says, they'r e not going to take me  into 
the army. So I  went and I registered myself. I 

wasn't  even seven days in Poland. Seven days, 10 days, some thing like that; don't you think, they 

draft me ?  With my wound, I neve
r forget the priest that took 
us. I was at school. I don't know 
whether you know that there was the richest Jews in our town, Fishenberg. The biggest steel 
companies in the world. He had in England, all 
over the world. There was a, how you call that, 
like a square he build up. He built a Jewish college 
at that time, they used to call it gymnasium. 
They bring that officially for the Jewish thing 
and the priest come s to 
me and says you come  
home . I got ______ (289) with me dals
. I was surprised that they done it. Before they draft me , 
I went to the police where my friend worked. I ne
ver forget that. Wa s my father's cousin, looked 
exactly like my father. He looks 
at the list, you know where there are few Jews comi ng. I almost 
jumped, I was sure it was my father because it was 
the same name as my father's. First, I looked 
at that. I didn't  look, I was scared to get up. I 
hid behind the walls, ______ (299) and everything.  
 
Of course, I was happy to see him too. [But he wasn
't  your father.] Wa sn't my father. A little bit 
smaller but he's  very tall too. Anyway, after that 
I told him the story. After he wished we were 
ma rching from ___(305) with the band to the ar

were Germans destroyed it right before us. 
They used to take water comi ng from out-of-to

part was this. They didn't have people much a

Open train. I had to throw out all the uniform, 
not all the uniform, only the jacket. I find the

 the other railroad when 
they start to control. I 
wind up in Krakow. I came to Krakow. I changed my na me , and I told them I upset the number. I

 things. They wanted the watch, you see. I 
bought soup, I was selling the watch and ever

jumping from that. Whe n I was working anytim

Russian, they had nails under their shoes, 52 nail

work, that™s why it hard for me . [The  Russians were
 looking for the traitors
