Q: Okay, so this is basically starting with liberation, but why don't we goback a little 
bit before you were liberatedand talk abouthow old you were, where you were living, 

t ha t
 
t ype  of  th i n g.
 
A:At liberation we were still living with Father Longiree(ph) and we were f reeto leave 

a t th at p oi nt , bu t he had  got ten a tt a che d to us  and wo u ldn ' t l et u s go a nd he a l so 

realized that wedidn't really haveaplaceto go backto, so we wou

backto Paris by himself andfound usaplaceto liveand it wasactually very same 

furnished room that we had occupied at the outset ofW orldW ar 2.
 
Q:
 
W hen you were stillwith the priest, tellmewherethat was?
 
A:That was in Saint Marten(ph) in French Alps. 
 
Q:So when youfoundout that it was liberation, do you rem emberthe day that you 

foundout or what, what activities were startingrightbefore t
h at .
 
A:W ell the liberation, the Norm andy landing was of  courseJune 6,1944,but where 

we were, in southeastern France, we werenotliberateduntil them iddle, August 15th, 

b ec au se we we r e l i be ra te db y N a vy c om in g in f r om  the  Med ite r r anea n.   A nd that 

peri
odbetween Norm andy landing and that time that we were actually liberated was 
a very difficult one because the Germ an troops were being pushed back by the troops 

in Norm andy and they wentona ram page andburning townsand takinghostages, 

so actually, tha
t period,that interim periodbetween the two liberations,exact, almost 
the most dangerous one for us.  W e had originally found out about the Norm andy 

landing on the BBC,but thenthe, when we actually liberated, in August, we justfound

A nd so  we

lackof nourishment and you know, being rundownf rom  the war and I contracted 

pleurisy and I was very illfor threemonths.  There wereno,of course no antibiotics 

in those days and I was, there was ________________ not much help available and 

it  
just took me forever to recover from that illness and I had to stay in bed for three

we were actually able to go to the French Riviera a

observant, although probably m ore than m y  parents were, but each generation was 

more observantandthat was the irony,that we were persecutedfor a faith that we 

really didn'tbelieve in.  But the Nazisdidn'tmake such distinctions.  I didn'tknow

you know what l

actuallyfelt guiltyfor having survived when m y grandmotherdidn't.  And I thought,I 
haveno right tobehappy.  And so any time alittle bitof happiness camem y way, I 

f e lt b ad abo ut  it , 
I said, "I don't, I don't have any right to feel that."  And this took a 

long timeand youknow I, I didn't know that this was a psychologicalproblem or this 

was a syndrom e, Imean this ishow If elt and it tookme yearsand years to getover 

tha t.  If in
ally did andnobody helpedme with it,I justf inally cam e to realizationthat 
it wasn'tm yfault.  ButI thinkthat that was the startof it.  And youknow, it leaves, 

the whole years leave psychological scars.  I had an anxiety syndrome, you know,

that you can't help and also if  we were at home and som ebody 

unexpectedly rang a doorbell or knocked on a door, I would start shaking and m y 

heart would pound likecrazy, I just f roze.  Because you know,there'sthatknockon

money and we lived ina room inghouse,but we could walk everywhereand we read

thought it sounded good, it was certainly worth takinga chance, so we left New 

Mexicoatthe endofthe school yearand drovebackto New York City.  My husband 

went tothe Department ofW elfareand got hired immediately as a social worker.  

And this
,this wasa very, very goodmove, because just shortly afterthat, the cityof 
New Yorkf roze all new hiring andhe got injust underthe wireand he woundup

I taught Frenchand Germ anand English there. And...
 
Q:And they stillnever,did they know at the timethat you hadno degrees?
 
A :  No .
 
Q: Bu t it wa sn 't a n issue ?
 
A: It wasn'tan issuebecauseall they caredabout, since they were a private school, 

they didn't have to, youknow, there was no certif icationand they knew I was 

qualif ied, probably better than some people who did have degrees and that's all they 

cared a
bout, thatI could dothe work.  And I wound up stayingtherefor 10 years,in 

that school.  Just, again, just doing the same thing, working with em otionally 

disturbed kids.  And we wereable thento get, withtwo salariescom ing in, steady

A:W ell it was, it was very emotionaland you know when you, whenever we've been

You know, things change and, but you, it was anemotionalmeetingwith all those

know that in m y case itwas a chemical imbalance, you know, hormonal im balance,

d i dn 't  have m an y f r ien ds  b ec au se th en,  th e B r on x becam e s o rt of  bad  a r ea .  Peo ple 

were afraidto visitus atnight and we were isolated.  W e were just really isolated.  

The only cont

Q: Did the peopleat work know what was going on?
 
A: Yeah.  And m y boss was very understanding.  She tried to get help for m y 

husbandand she, she really, she wa

was just the most understanding boss I ever had.  But things were just, I m ean they 

were just so, so bad,causem y husbandcouldn't deal with m y illnessbecauseof  his

em otional baggage onhisend because of hisfather having been killed and it, itcame 

out in him
 
too.  So we were both living in our ownm iserable worlds.  Andso you 
know, they reachedapoint where I couldn'twork anymore and they toldm e that, 

you know, you just can't work any m ore and I had to leave m y job because it was

and the pressure,  I couldn't
 
take pressure,that's one thingI'venever been ableto 
take is pressure, any kind of pressure, since the war.  So this didn't work out and my 

boss was very understanding, shem anagedtogetm eon disability and so then, that

of  the  class ic  s ym p tom s of  am aj o r dep r e ss i on .

he wastrying to probably f ind out whetherthathad anything, getme to talk, b

clamm ed up and, because I was so paranoid, I thought, "Oh this man is, you know, 

he's going to kill me, he's like Hitler."   So I didn't say anything.  And so the shock 

treatments didn't work,I wassent home.

I guess ina way, I hadto takeover thefinance as I said andI guess ina way it was

Q: You think you would have studied teaching?
 
A: Yeah, I m ean, if I had been able to, the other thing I always regretted, I wanted to 

bea librarian,but of course you know, 
_ ___ ______ __ ___  co l l e ge  de gr e e,  go in g to

would have gone quite a way if  I, if I'd had the opportunity f or the education, but in 

this way I felt I could make a cont

Q:And your husband wasstill alive during those?
 
A: Yeah, right.  And then, we joineda local Unitarianfellowshiphere.  Andm y

an
dI wentby m yself.  Made som ef riends there and slowly I started telling them 
about m y background again, you know, during the Holocaust and I was a little leery 

because, in them idwest, you know, Ialways, youhad thisfeeling,m isconception 

that people a
re narrow m indedand you know,you know,I was still afraid of rejection 

anddiscrim ination but If ound that people were so interested because in New York, 

Holocaust survivors are a dimea dozen, but here really, they don'thave thisaccess 

and I found out
 
that they were very interested.  And so this encouraged me and so 
at the fellowship on Sunday, they have program s on Sunday mornings, they have 

outsidespeakers and speakersfrom theirowngroup and so they encouragedme to 

give a talk.  Andthis isthe veryf irst timethat I talkedpublicly about whathappened.

preservation thing.  So I tell them there arethree reasons why I give this talk, is, one 
i s  to  k
eepalive the mem ory of the six m illion victimsof  Hitler, includingm y 
grandparents.  And two is to counterthe,the revisionist liesof people who would 

say that, you know,there was no Holocaust, oh it was exaggerated, it wasn'tas bad 

andthen third is
 
so it wouldn't everhappenagain and in theendIaskthe kids, I said, 
" Ineed your help in keepingthe story alive,because weare calledthe last witnesses 

a nd m y fe a r is  t hat  once , o n ce we ' r e gone , m y ge ner at i on , t he r e won ' t b e a n yon e lef t 

to keep the
 
story alive, so I'm counting on you."  And, and you know, I've gotten 
thesedarling little letters,they said, "Don't worry Mrs. Edm ands, we won'teverforget 

you, what you said,"  and youknow, it was very, very, very gratif ying and I've never 

e nc ou nt ered
 
any hostility, I'vetalked toalldifferent kinds of groups andthey've 
always been most friendly, there's never any hostile comm ents or anything like that.  

But the one wonderful experience I had, well one good experience was in 1990, when 

F a the r  Lon gi r e

b een  a wa r de d the  Medal  of  t he J ust,  f r om  Yahd va shem (p h ) and  t hen  o r ga n i ze rs in 

hishom etownof Antsee(ph), which is thetown closest to where his parish was, 

d ec i de d to h a ve a com m em o ra t i ve
 
ceremonyfor himandf rom  some other priests 
who hadhelped people likeus.  And I was invitedto the ceremonies, which were 

held in 1990, in May 1990 and I stayed with m y f riend there and it was just a 

wonderful, wonderful ceremony, theyhad dignitaries

p os th um o us l y and  it  wa s gi ve n to  m e an dI asked th at t he m eda l be pu t in a gl a ss 

caseand put in hisformer church so that everybody would, would see it.  So this 

w
as one of the high points.  And then I found out about other priests and their heroic 
deedsandall the wonderful things they had done,so I camebackwith a whole 

collectionof stories of just, you know, sheer heroismand what I waspointingout is,

a lt ru ism wh ic h
 
you would never think possible.  People risking their lives and their

But it's not up to us to either, you know, hate or forgive and I
 
do not have any 
bitterness to anyone, becausebitterness and hate, in this context is a self

yourself, it candestroy you.  And I realizedthatI couldn't let

Q:The years that youwere really growing and prospering andI take it yourhusband 

was reallyfalling apart,was he awareof  whatwas happening with you,of how much 

you were growing andgetting better?  Iknow I asked youthat before, you said that,

A: Justm aybeonone level, but only on one very elem entary level.  He was proud 

of what I was doing, yes, he was always proud and he always encouraged me, but 

on the otherhand, he resentedm y being away f rom home somuch.  You know,he 

f e lt I sh ou ld be the r e wi t h h im  a l l the t im e , n i gh t and d a y.  A nd he cam e t o r

h e wa s re a l l y  of  t wom i n ds ab ou t it .  In one wa y he wa s p rou dof m ea nd the ot he r  

onehe resentedm y success.  Because healways regarded himself as afailure, you 

know.  Hehad this terrible inferiority com plex.  I don't know why, causehe wasa 

b
rilliant man.  But that's part of  the syndrome, so as I say, he was always of  two 
m inds about it.
 
Q:W hen, when you lookback at thisnow and you look back at thetimethat your, 

when yourmom died,can you kindof piecetogether,has itbeen longenough s

you  canpiece together what happened to you exactly,that her loss really kindof

A: It was, she wassuffering a lotbecauseshe saw how, you know,m y husband's 
alcoholism  was destroying the marriage and destroying us.  And so when she was 

gone, it's though as somebody just pulled the rug out from  under me, I had lost 
e ve r y 
support that I've ever had. 
 
Q: T alk about your life now.  Now, now that you're, you have friends, you have a full 

l if e.   W hen  d id  you  m ove i n to yo u r  ho us e?
 

A : Im oved i nt om yh ouse t h ree  yea r s a go an d i t was the  ve r yf i rs tt i m e th at I had 

ever owned
 
ahouse, we had always lived inapartm ents and it wasalif elongdream 
to own som ething that was really m ine and to have a little garden and to grow stuff.  

Ifeel blessedin so many ways, causeI, I cantruly say, I don't have,you know, that 

much money,
 
I have a small pension to live on, but I can pay m y m ortgage and I can 
pay m y bills and I feel blessed because I have everything now that I have ever 

wa n t ed .  Ih a vep ea ce of m i nd and  I don ' t rea l l y ha ve an y wo r r ie s,I t ak e ca re of  

m yself.  My husband died in 1993 as I said and that was, that was a hard blow, but 

i t  wa sn 't un e xpe ct edb ec ause he had be en s o illan dh e wa s ju stab s o lut e l y 

determ ined to kill him self.  He had, he did have a death wish, which for reasons that, 

you know, I will never know andhe
 
was justabsolutelydeterm ined to doaway with 
him self .  And, and I f igure, well he f inally got his wish and then, but I realized that life 

had to goone andso going on withm y lifeandbuying thehouse was, was the first 

s t ep and  I ha d a l r ead y qu i t e a  c
ircle of friends too, m y volunteer work and to other 
organizations, so I justreally keptdoing what, what I wasdoing before,only now I

didn't feel guilty about it f or being away f rom  home.  And during the school year as I 
said, I give talks and I still 
vo l unt eer  at t he p ub li c  l ib r a r y an d ot he r wi s e  I k eep  bu s y.  
There'salwayshousework to bedone, gardenwork.  I go, Itake walks, I read a lot, 

I'm  trying to learn m ore about history, especially during the pre
-
N a zi  peri o d to  f i nd  out 
wh a t  happen ed , th at  w
hat werethe circum stances that led to the rise of Nazis in 
Germany.  I have a lot of, lotof different interests, I've interest in linguisticsand 

history, geology, so many different things, that I'll probably never be able in a lifetime 

t o  s at i sf y them  a
ll, but I'm  fortunate that I have a nice library and it keeps m e busy.  
A nd I  t r y,  you  kno w,  I t ak e  som e t r ip s.   A nd , oh,  one of th e m a in  th in gs t hat  I wa n ted 

to relate is Ihada very unusualexperience last year in October.  I had, during the 

wa r, afte r 
we leftParis, in 1940or so, we woundup ina little village in southern 

France, calledKalvisol(ph)and there we stayedfora year whenm yf ather was in the 

labor camp there and then, this was at the time, the f ree zone, the rest of France 

being occupied
 
by Germany.  Andthen when theGermans broke theirpact with 
Franceto,to leave part of Francefree and occupied the southern zone,m yfather's 

lif e was again in danger.  And sodue toa local partisan pastor, who was also the 

towndoctor, we were able to get away causehe hadmadea certif icate sayingm y 

f at he r hada dan ge ro u s i l lne ss an d cou l dn 't bem o ve da nd he a ls oa r ra n ge df o rm y 

fam ily to getfake ID'sthatenabledus, withfake nam es thatenabled us tofinally 

leavethis villageandthe rest is recorded, you know, whatfollowed after that is 

recorded in the originalvideo Im adefor the Holocaust Museum inW ashington.  But 

we had never, none of us had ever gone back, except for m y father, he m ade a trip

back to that little village and am ong other pl
aces, somewhere in the, you know, Idon't 
know, 60's or so, I'm  not sure, early 70's, but he went on his own.  And he did see 
this pastor and his wife and then this pastor died at age 90 in 1974.  So I, for m y 

part, had lostall contact with the village.  
A ndt he n a st r an ge th in g hap pen ed , I had 
given a copy of m y book to thepeople in thetown of Antsee(ph).  TheArchbishop 

wanteda copy because youknow, it wasabout a priest andso on andthenthe 

organizers of the commem orative ceremony for the priest, 
wi t h  whom  I  h ad  b ec om e 
very goodf riends and we'dbeen corresponding and they had com eand visit ushere, 

s o  we  we re  re a l l y goodf r iend s b y the n.   And t he y ha d l ent m y boo k t o af r ie nd of  

theirs who wasa priestandof course,he knew FatherLongiree(ph), 
bu t th en , wh en 
hecame to the chapterthat dealt with the one yearthat we spent in southernFrance, 

thenameof the town,Kavisol(ph) rang abell.  He said,"Oh, I know that town,I know 

som ebody who livesthere."  And you know, it wassuchacoincidence 
be ca use of  
all theplaces in France it could havebeen,this particularonehe knew.  And it was 

justatinyham let.  And what happened, thisman named Marcel Coulier(ph), wasa 

young man during the war and he was hiding f rom , he didn't want, all young 

F re
nchmen have todoforced labor inGermany andthose who didn't want todo that 
we n t und e r gr oun d.   And th i sp r i e st tha th e lped th i s yo un gm an h ide ,a nd the y had 

stayed in contact and then many, m any years later, you know this man had moved 

t o Pa r i s, got te n 
m arried and then in his retirem ent he came back to the town of 
Kalvisol(ph) and wherehe was living.  Andso thispriestcopied m y chapter thatdealt 

with our lives in southern France and send ittohisfriends, hey lookyou know,this

accurate, the names, everything was accurate in every detail.  And of course they 

didn't know that their pastor had done all this cause he wasn't one to, to brag about

Couliers(ph), they had become f riends and so m y f riend in Antsee(ph) said, " If you

otherwise Isaid, you know," How
 
am  I goingto get there, it's like inthem iddleof 
nowhere."  And so that's what I wound updoing andoriginally I justwas planning 

when Iplanned m y trip, I planned, you know,two or threedays because I said," I 

don't know thesepeople."  I didn't even know where I was goingtostay.   And then 

when I wrotemydates,they said, "Oh, this willneverdo,this'll never do, you're going 

tohave to stay withusfor a weekat least,cause we haveall these plans."  And you 

know, you have, so I had to change all m y f lights, everything.  Finally went to

people, people in their 80's and their 70's, so m y turn probably won't com e for a

Austria and just stay there for a m onth or two months, you know and just, instead of 
going back andforth and really, you know, juststay there, because I do love 
A us t r ia, 
it's a beautiful country, but I couldn't do this unless I had this, so this is really the only 

plan I have.  
 
Q:W hat about plans with dating, meeting other men, is that something you ever even 

think about?
 
A: No.  No, Ihave, you know, I have absolutely no interest in meeting men.  Ifeel 

we l l ,  o kay,  I m ea n m y hu sb an d an d I  ha d a good m a r ria ge e xce pt f o r h is a l co ho l i sm .  

I justfelt that I could never meetanybody with whom I was as well suited as I was 

with him .  And to me that's not really important because any, I know that any man I 

would meet would be at least m y age or older and I think it's a matter of self
-
p r e se r va tion th at I don ' t wa nt to  de a l wi t hs ome bod y,  get t in g at ta ch ed to som ebo d y 

and thatperson getting sick and dying, you know.  Ifinally at thepoint where I really 

onlyhave to worry aboutm yself andIdon't wantto getem otionally involved with 

anyone else, ever.
 
Q:But youfeel that you havef riendsthat are likeafam ily to you?
 
A : Ye ah,  we l l ye s , yo uk no w,  I ha ve go odfr ien ds a nd I don ' t re a l l yf in d tha t I don ' t 

really, I mean if I didn't have, it's nice to have f riends, but I'm  perfectly comfortable 

with m yself, because Ithink,I think they say thatpeople who don't like being alone, 

i t ' s t ha t th e y don ' t l i ke them s e l ves  and  th i
s was true at some point in my life, but now 
I  got t o the p o in t,  I s a y, I l i k e wh o I am ,  you  k now wh a t , I ' ve a c cep te d tha t and  I'm f ee l 

comfortable with who I am .  So I don't m ind being alone because I have m y music,

Q: An d L
awrence is your home?
 
A :L a wr enc e i sm yhome , ye s, Ifeel , yo u kno w I ' vea l wa ys  want ed to li ve  i na sm a l l

times just fora visit, although now Idon'thave anybody leftthereand
 
I  tho u ght, oh, I 
would never wantto live there any more, never.  I'm glad I'm, I'mthankful.  You 

know I, wellhere's another thing.  Ifeel now that everythingthat happens in life, 

happens for a purpose, good or bad, that we may not always know wh at th
e  pu r pose 
i s ,  bu t i t 's  n ot  a l l fo r  u s to  que st i on.   B ut  no thi ng h app en s f or  no  rea s on , so  I  can  see 

a trend to m y entire life, that things had happened and there's always worked out for 

the good at theendand if Ihadn't had thisdepression, wem ay notha
ve  c om e  t o 

Lawrenceandthen I wouldhave wind up in New York City andmaybem y husband 

wouldhave died in New York andI would have beeneven morealone because 

there's nothing like being alone in a big city, you can be surrounded by m illions of 

p eop l e an
d still feel all alone and I've never had this feeling here.  So and I would 
have never had m y house and I mean, everything just works out for the good in the 

end, if you just trust.
