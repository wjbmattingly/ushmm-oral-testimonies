Interview : Beate Karsfeld
 
Q: 
 
Whe n and where  we re you born? 
 
I am int ere sted in he aring about your family,  your first years 
of sc hooling.
 
A:
 
I was born Fe bruary 13,  1939 in Be rlin
, before the start of the war.
  
My Father was in the army, 
he  was not an office r,
 
nor a Party membe r, and le ft for t he  war.  
  
Mother and I were left alone 
in Be rlin
 
in their a
p
artme nt.
  
Th
e apartment 
was damage d
 
and we 
we nt to some
 
re lat ive s
 
who 
live d outside  Be rlin.
  
I started Kinder
gart
en
 
in a place
 
120 Kms. away from Be rlin and
 
my first  
memories are from the time Germans were pushed from the Eastern territories
,  we  we re in ( 
sounds like Boulangie r)
, where were camps for Germans refugees.  We lived there and I went to 
the Director of
 
the Kindergarten
 
oblige d us to salute  with t he He il Hitle r and to sing Nazi songs.
  
There was a time to
 
play, we  we re  childre n.  
I  was not Je wish,  so I  had no problems.   It was a 
hard t ime be cause  we  had not e nough to e at
,  I re membe r that  the  City had a c
ase rn
 
so there 
we re a lot of Ge rman soldie rs around t he place ,  
then my next memories when this part of 
Ge rmany was t ake n ove r by t he Russians ,  yhey came ove r and we  we re living in a litt le  town
 
in 
the country, where we thought they would not come.
  
I  remem
be r t he  first Russians who came ,  
they were on horses
,  and in this part of t he  country the re  we re  only childre n and wome n
,  I  
remember they took rings and jewelry 
and as it  happens e ve rywhe re the  Russians soldie rs
 
were 
t he
y du
g out jew
el
ry
 
and took whatever
 
was interesting to them.
  
This was my first  impre ssion 
of occupation in Germany.
 
Q:
 
Be  so kind to t e ll us about  your e ducat ion ye ars post  war.   Do you remembe r anyt hing be ing 

spoke n 
in your family about  the  holocaust or what  happe ne d to t he  Je ws in 
Ge rmany
 
in WW2?
 
A:
 
Then after 
the above  we ret urne d to Be rlin,  be cause my Fathe r had be
en
 
prisone r of the
 
English 
and he  was libe rate d and he  came  back and 
I starte d school.  I would say my family was a typic al 

Ge rman family
, not member of the Party, but t
hey belonge d to the  sile nt majority
 
whe n Hit le r 
came to powe r and vote d for him
 
and at h
ome they did not speak
 
about  it and I re me mbe r t hat 
in
 
school
 
some refugees came, we had 2
-
3 
Jews from Poland and t he  childre n came  t o our class 
and we knew they were J
ews
 
but not much more.  I remember also that the history teacher 
e xplaine d
 
t hat t he  be ginning of t he 2nd.  WW was because  Hit le r and Stalin
 
had signed a non
-
aggre ssion pact,  but
 
teacher
s we re  for Hit ler,  we re  mainly me n 
 
and were care ful e xplaining t o 
child
re n who c ould not  ask t he m
 
what t hey did,  we re  you in the
 
Ge rman
 
army?
  
During my t ime 
in school the re  was no ment ion of the holocaust , knew some t hing about 2 Je ws
 
in class ( Je wish 
proble m) but  not  having any e xplanation
 
it  doe s not  he lp to unde rst and.
 
Q:
 
So people we re quite  sile nt about
 
it.
 
A:
 
Where I was, Yes.
 
Q: 
 
We re you in
 
East or We st  Be rlin?
 

A:
 
We st Be rlin.
 
Q:
 
Te ll me  about  e ducat ion,  high school,  and then to Paris t o study.
 
A:
 
I left school before getting ( name of 
?de gre e , not  cle ar)and did 2 ye
ars
 
more
 
in a profe ssional 
school
, started 
t o work in a pharmace ut ic al company named Sche ring,  it was ve ry boring.  I had 
a frie nd
 
who came from Poland and se tt led in Be rlin aft e r the  war.  I was not fee ling ve ry happy
, 
first I did not want to st ay at  my P
are nts™ plac e
, had t he  fe e ling I have to go away t o look what  
can make
 
a young 
girl happy so I de cide d whe n a frie nd of mine  came back from London
 
where 
she  was an aupair; so I said
 
I™ ll join you and we both go to Paris; so I le ft Berlin e arly in 1960 
be cause of the  nee d to find somet hing e lse
 
for t he  future ,  I took the  de c ision against the  will of 
my Parents
,  be c ause in Paris a young girl could ge t lost
 
and at this time in 1960 I met my future 
husband,  whose Fat he r
 
was de porte d and was Jewish and was t
he  first who e xplaine d
 
to me 
re ally what happe ne d in Ge rmany 
be twee n 1933
-
45 wit h docume nts and books.
 
Q:
 
Ve ry inte
re sting
.  Can you e laborate  how you me t Se rge
 
Karsfe ld,  what did he  te ll you, how you 
found out
 
about the holocaust, German involvement in WW
2 . 
A:
 
About  Se rge,  we  me t going to t he language  school ﬁ Allianc e  Francaise
 
ﬁ,
he ended Science 
Politique and we met at the place where we both lived, porte St. Cloud where we still
 
live there.  
He took the metro to go to Science Politique
 
and I took the me
t ro to go to Raspail Alliance  
Francaise
,  he spoke  to me .   I had a blue  book which was use d to learn Fre nch,  so he  ask,  I looke d 
ve ry much like a Ge rman, so to st art  spe aking he  asked me: are  you English?
  
I  said no I  am 
Ge rman, t hat
 
was t he  be ginning of our conve rsat ion
,  we  se parat e d at  Sevres Babylone
 
station, I 
gave  him the  phone #
whe re I was aupair,  he said he  will call
 
me
 
and calle d me  a day late r and 
offe re d me  an appointme nt .
  
Q:
 
You me nt ione d ye st erday and I  re ad in your book
 
that the story of ? Hansel
 
Sophie  ?? 
influe nce d 
you a lot .
 
A:
 
I nflue nce d alre ady my husbamd
, my Mother
-
in
-
Law 
was not very happy that  
her son was dat ing 
a Ge rman 
girl and my husband has connect ions wit h
 
a Ge rman assoc iat ion
 
in the  Camp 
Universitaire
,  so he
 
had re ad t he  story of Sophie
 
t he  young stude nt s and the  te ache r
 
who 
combat Hitler with
 
opposing
 
flie rs 
and  
giving the ir lives for t hat  o
pposition, they were executed 
and t he ir te ache rs too, so he  said if t he re  had be e n 
the se  youngste rs who oppose d Hitle r
 
t aking 
t he  risk of be ing kille d
 
t he n t he  Ge rman youth is not  guilt y and this he lpe d him 
ve ry much to 
speak to
 
a Ge rman
 
and among his frie nds who I  me t lat e r
 
t he re  was quite  a bit of opposit ion 
against  Ge rmans,  rich and we ll to do familie s
 
could be tole rat
ed
 
but I  was
 
a Ge rman wit hout  
e ducat ion and poor,  so I was save d
 
and frie nds could se e  some body as a wife .
 
Q:
 
I  assume  many aske d you how Se rge  influe nce d you,  but I  would ask t he  opposit e que st ion: how 
did you influe nce  him during that  ye ar
. 

Aﬂ
 
As I said,
 
I spoke  to him for the  first time
 
and t hat made  my historical e ducat ion,  knowing what 
happe ne d in Ge rmany
 
so but influe nce d I  do not  know,  I  did not influe nc e d him bec ause  I  
explained my mother
-
in
-
law
 
whe n I me t  he r,  I think I me t he r a ye ar late r,  afte r 
we  met and she 
was 
a pe rson looking
 
not
 
what  a pe rson as a social
 
func tion 
but what  is a pe rson itse lf.   She 
loved me very much
; but this is bot h t hings toge t he r,  she  is Jewish,  I  am Ge rman
 
whose Fat he r 
was in t he  Ge rman Army
, the fact that we
 
t ook
 
part in the  polit ical
 
life  t hat was an opportunity 
that in Germany Kurt Kiesinger
 
a propagandist and me mbe r of t he  Party
w
as elected 
as Ge rman 
Chance llor, so all toge t he r 
we  had pre pare d and I  had be e n informe d
 
by him what was Nazi 
Ge rmany,  he knowing 
t ha
t Ge rman Youth was not  guilt y,  he always said : you know
 
as you are  
Ge rman you have  to t ake your re sponsibilit y, be c ause  Ge rmany is not all bad
 
t hey have  a 
he ritage  of marve lous music ians and writers
,  the re are me n of good and bad,  
and t his pushe d 
me very 
much and I  t hink I  took my re sponsibility.
  
I  gave him what he hope d, I  was some body
 
German who decided to act.
 
Q:
 
I think he believed that when 2 people meet there
 
is a 2 way influe nce
,  I  don™ t  think one 
influences the other, it works both ways.
That
 
is why I askthe question
 
but I  don™t know my 
answer.  When you started to work on your Kiesinger case
 
were you in the Youth German 
Offic e ?
 
A:
 
Yes, I learned in France that the German Youth Office opened in Paris
 
I se nt my cv and I  was 
t ake n as a se c ret ary
, nothing else, so I belonged to 
the  founding membe rs of t his Fre nc h 
Ge rman Youth O ffice ,  my work was not suc h an inte resting
 
one ,   my day as 
 
a Ge rman 
what  was 
of interest to me was to work in an Institution
 
where there was Youth of both countries, to lea
rn 
and at  this time
 
in 1966 when Kiesinger was elected.
 
Q:
 
Would you be  so kind to
 
trll us the story of the Kiesinger case.  How did it start
 
from your point  
of vie w, how it de ve lope d and of course
 
the story of your involvement.
 
A:
 
Whe n I  saw in the  ne wspa
pe rs
 
in Ge rmany that t he  ne w Chance llor was a membe r of 
t he  Nazi Party
 
and adjoined t o t he  Hitle r propaganda
 
for fore ign count rie s
 
,  Se rge  said to 
me  Beata  there are some moments
 
you c an do somet hing and he  wrote for me  a 
ﬁt ribuneﬂ
 
in Fre nc h and I brought the se  fre e  tribune s to a Fre nch ne wspape r at t his yime  
calle d Combat,  it  was a le ft ne wspape r, and so I was embarrassing
 
to the Chief t
hat  I  
was a Ge rman who took the  opport unity to let  us know in a Fre nc h
 
ne wspape r that  
there was
 
some body in France  who could not
 
allow t his man t o re pre se nt  the  German 
ne ws and will 
be the 
re prese nt
ative 
for the  Ge rman gove rnment,  so t he y publishe d 3 
t ribunes
 
and st ate d t he German news ca
n re cognize  a man,  Willie  Brandt ,  who was a 
fre e dom fighte r
 
but
 
never a man like  Kie singe r who is a dange r to democracy
 
in 
Ge rmany and in one  of t he  art icles I said I was fire d
 
from my Ge rman
-
Fre nch ne ws office  
as I  had signe d wit h my name
 
not as belonging to the German
-
Fre nch 
ne ws 
office
,  
The re  was no reason for t he
m to fire  me
,  be sides
 
t hat t he y we re  against what I said and 
I was fire d from one day to the  ot he r, t his was finally the  moment  for me to decide
 
if we  
are  going ahe ad
.  The letter we received
  
said if  you take  back
 
what  you said in the  

art ic le  you can 
continue  to work in our I nst it ut ion,  and we  said NO .
  
Then Serge 
remembered when his Father was deported
 
he had a frie nd who c ame  back who t old 
my Mot he r
-
in
-
law
 
when the Kapo was beating him my Father
-
in
-
law de fe nded him and 
he was sent to the
 
coal mine s i
n 
retaliat ion
 
and we  said if my Fathe r
-
in
-
law could
 
in a 
situation whe re he  was in dange r of death resist  t o t he  Ge rmans in a c amp
,  an 
Democrat ic Part yext erminat ion camp,  how can we  no
t  
re sist  and cont inue
 
our campaign 
against Kie singe r,  and so
 
t his was ou
r dec ision, my husband was working at  this time  
having a salary,  I was fire d and he  he lpe d me  not only with advise s
 
but also wit h mone y 
and we  st art e d a campaign.  I we nt  to Ge rmany
 
to se e membe rs of t he Parliame nt  and 
Journalists
,  stude nts,  
in orde r to 
say you know t he sit uat ion whe re you have  to prot e st
, 
it is the first time after the war that the German Government
 
is rule d by a Nazi and 
there is not a lot of involvement
,  
Answers stated that he had been elected 
de mocrat ic ally  and 
le t™s go.  This was finally t he  de cision t hat Se rge  and myse lf 
re ache d,  
so in orde r
 
t o say we can not  do anything le gally t hn we  have  t o change
 
and disc
uss 
what  to do.  First int e rruptions in t he Parliame nt whe n Kiesinge r spoke, 
and I  was 
arrested and there were news in the ne
wspape rs
 
and they had to t e ll why I  was 
arre ste d
.  The second attack was when we learned that there was
 
going to be
 
a 
Congre ss
 
of the  Christian
 
De mocrat ic Party in Be rlin, ve ry cont rove rsial be c ause the  
students had protested
 
stating that
 
t his Party will n
eve r
 
have  a mee t ing in Be rlin.
 
Will 
not take place
  
At t his time  anot he r lie ,  big demonstrations
 
took place  about  t hat t his 
Congre ss
 
will not  take place ,  so we  de c ide d some thing
 
can be  done  
in Be rlin at  the  
Int e rnational Congre ss of the  Party; so I le ft  
Paris without  pre parat ion
 
be side s having a 
photograph of some body who promi
se d 
to pick me and take me to the Congress
 
Hall.  
So I  arrive d,  not  knowing what  t o do
 
as we  had forwarde d all t he  docume nt s against  
Kiesinger
 
and distribut e d all ove r
,  so I was kno
wn as the woman attacking Kiesinger
 
for 
be ing t he  German Chanc e llor and that  is all, you le arn in e xpe rime n
t ing and it took 
about  4
-
5 days, so I had to go to Press meetings, to Conference Public meetings
; I  was 
unable  to approach Kie singe r close  e nough to 
slap him
,  the act ion we had we  had 
pre pare d to place the young ge ne rat ion against   t he  olde r ge ne rat ion and slap 
some body is not so e asy
,  I did not want  to do it  in a hot e l hall 
whe re  you only face  e ach 
ot he r; we  had to have t he  support
 
of t he public and the  me dia and so the last day of t he 
Con
gre ss, at closing and whe n Kie si
nge r 
 
had to de live r his last spe ech I  had t he  c hance  
with t he c ard of a journalist  to e nte r the  Hall and to be  in a sit uat ion across the  Hall
 

finding myse lf be hind him and so whe n all 
t he se possibilit ie s
 
are give n I took my 
courage  and ye lle d ﬁ Nazi go outﬂ and slap him,  he  t urn back to me
 
and it  was dange rous 
for me be cause in t he  
first raw he  had his bodyguards,  but  with him st anding be hind me  

t he y could not shoot,  he had no ide a of what happe ned to him, who I  was
 
be cause  as I 
said it  was not  t he first  time
 
t hat  I brought his Nazi past,  I  was arre st e d ,  the n there  was 
a disc ussion: ﬁ  le t he r go because  I was se xually not satisfiedﬂ,  a crazy woman,  
but it 

could not t ake  because  I was known wit h all my document s ,so he  was oblige d to suit 
me 
 
and I  was put in jail, conde mne d t
he  same day t o 1 ye ar in jail wit hout  suspension,  
and as I said be fore , it  was in Be rlin t he  Cit y rule d by the  Allie s,
 
I was a Fre nch Citize n,  I 

am Ge rman and Fre nc
h,  
and if arre ste d I could claim my Fre nc h Citize nship 
and ask to 
se e  t he  Fre nch Commander of Be rlin to be t ransfe rred in front of a Fre nc h Court and 
t his was t he  argume nt
 
told whe n I  was
 
condemne d and I t old my lawye r, who was a 
lawye r of the  opposit ion
 a
t this t ime  and his name  was ??Mar, ,?
 
I  t old him to go 
tomorrow to see the French Commander
,  I t hink that be cause  of t he  embarrassing 
situation he  aske d for ﬁ  inte rrupt ion ﬁ .  I calle d home  and said I will be re lease d be cause  
t he y announce d it imme diate ly
 
that this was the decision, the next step 
would be  t he  
t rial and we  had pre pare d docume nt s, as at t his time we  did not  want  a t rial of the  slap 
but the trial of Keisinger.  I went to the Center of Jewish Documentation in Paris, there 
in the  history se ct io
n 
worke d  Jose ph Billick?? Who had done  R
ussian
 
st udie s in 
Ge rmany,  Philosophy and Mathemat ics,  
was a hist orian in t he  Ce nter and I asked
: was I  
right to slap Kie singe r for his past ? And he  said YES,  and he  came  wit h us t o Be rlin 
to be 
a moral witnwss,  t he
 
Doctors we re so afraid t hat now as a historian he  would be  
allowe d to t alk about t he Nazi Party
, so they cancelled for the time being stating that it 
would take 
a couple  of mont hs,  t he n W.  Brand
t came to power and I was amnestied
, 
but I  c ont inue d to work 
aga
inst  Kie singer be cause  he  was ru
nning
 
for Pre side nt  of t he 
Le gislat ive  body in 69,  
I  slap him in 68 on Nove mbe r 7,  and I joine d the  L
eftist Party, the 
Communist
 
Student Peace Movement and I said I will be 
in the  spot
 
t hat Kie singer was 
running for 
in 
t he  Parliament  and I was an official candidat e  able  t o follow him
 
in the 
Nat ional campaign and whe re  he came  to spe ak I was t he re  wit h my frie nds
 
and we  
st art e d shout ing Kie singe r a Nazi and he  had to re sign 
and finally his party lost , he  had 

to leave and 
W,  Brandt
 
re plac ed him.   Eve n t he n not only my slap but my campaigh, and 
at this time I  had not  succe
e
de d be fore
 
to mobilize the German Youth
, t he  slap was a big 
t hing be cause ,  in Be rlin,
 
at  t he  e nd of the  Congre ss,  t he  Youngs had not
 
suc ce e ded on 
t he  issue
 t
hat t he  Congre ss should not  t ake  place
 
and for t he m t he  slap was a 
satisfac tion
,  I  had a lot of stude nt s of the le ft be hind me
 
and at  the  me et ings he  could 
not  speak because  t he  shout s and rumors
 
of t he  st ude nt™ s opposition
 
and I  guess it had 
made  an imp
re ssion on t he Ge rman 
public.
 
Q:
 
I be lie ve  your art icle from Combat in which you praise d W.Brandt  was somehow 
pre moni
tory
 
because  what he  did lat e r 
in Warsaw  show you we re  right.
 
A:
 
Yes, certainly, 
and at t he  t ime  W. Brandt was alre ady out  and had t rie d seve ral time s 
to 

be come Chanc e llor and had a lot of problems and I was le ading a campaign for him
 
in 
France ,  for W< B<
 
Q:
 
I would like  to go back for 1 second to t he  mome nt of the  slap,  were  you afraid
?  
I t  was 
an ac t of courage .
 
A:
 
Mu
ch more  afraid t o suc cee d,
 
in the time before
 
I was able to??, ,? Must act  in t he  
mome nt
,  I was not  sure  I™ ll have  the  courage
, not courage   the reflex to slap, because if 
you are  in front
 
of a big room, a lot of people  an
d you have  to slap a man
 
because at this 
t ime for me  he was a Nazi,  but  if you slap a man be fore  you,  so,  
but in the moment you 

have  to act  we  ne ve r faile d be cause  it  is t he  whole preparat io
n,  at t he be ginning we  
we re complet e ly alone  and now we had a grou
p 
around us,  sons and daught ers of t he  
de port e d Je ws from France
,  but  we always we re  alone and had t o pre pare  t he  files,  do 
re search, 
t ie  our le afle ts,  we  ne ve r had a Pre ss Att ache  who said Mrs. Kar
sfe ld
 
you have  
t o go to this spot ,  it was always by ourse lve s, you have  as the y say in Fre nc h ﬁ 
de brouille rﬂ an t his was so.

Q:
 
So you can say Kie singe r was your first case?
 
A:
 
Ye s,  it  was it was my first case  and t he most  spe ct acular and ce rtainly t he  most important  for 
me  as a Ge rman be cause  it was t he  
 
slap given by all t he  Ge rmans who fought  wit h me against  him and it was the slap against  t he Nazi 
ge ne ration, and as I always 
say e ve n killing Kie singer would not  had t he  impact on public  

opinion as a slap,  be cause it  was in re lat ion to thos who had voted for him who had de cide d to 
vote  for him as a Premie r Ministe r, and I think it is some t hing I ne ve r accomplishe d again and it  
was a de cision of t he  mome nt ,  it succee de d and for that I ™ ll ce rt ainly e nd up in Ge rman history 

and though t he  Ge rman Polit icians of today ge ne ration are  ve ry much oppose d,  e ve n t oday,  t o 
t he  ge st ure ; but I  also be came  known in I srae l and among t he  Je wish 
world, was propose d for a 
Nobel Peace Prize, I think that this gesture in Germany has shown that there is a new generation 
as W.  Brandt and I could not  have  pre pare d myse lf for t his from books, but could pre pare   wit h ﬁ 
civil courageﬂ as t hey say in Ge rman
y  and I  succe e de d.
 
Q:
 
It  was ve ry symbolic!
 
A:
 
Yes, it was.
 
Q:
 
Am I correct to say that the next case was the Achenbacker case blocking the nomination of 
Achenbacker to the Economic European Committee.
 
A:
 
Yes.
 
Q:
 
Can you de sc ribe  for us t his case , ple ase
. 
A:
 
As we had worke d out t he  doc ument s,  we saw that  Ac he nbacke r was in the Ge rman Rmbassy,  in 

the Political service and had been sending Telexes concerning the deportation of French Jews 
and Foreign Jews,  and had signe d t ele grams, so we  had known,  we  me t
 
t he name of 
Achenbacker in the archives together with the search about Kiesinger and then we learned after 
W. Brandt becme  Chance llor and  was part of the Liberal Party in t he  Parliament  and 

Ache nbacke r was a member of t he L ibe ral Party,  he had to make  so
me processes in order to 

have  a big c oalit ion, so we said a man like Ache nbacker cannot be  in Brusse ls toge the r with all 
t hose from c ount rie s which had be e n rule d by Ge rman occupie rs and it  has to be a morality and 
we  cannot  t ake as a Ge rman Commissione r a
 
man like  Ache nbac ke r, and I colle ct ed all the  
doc ume nt s c oncerning Ache nbacker and I we nt to se e 6 membe rs of t he  Ge rman Economic Unit  
and I  we nt t o see  them in Brusse ls and France and said you know we  have  to t ake  a de c ision and 
finally unde r the scanda
l t he  Ge rmans said Mr. Ache nbacke r is re place d by Mr. Are ndorf who 
be came ,  up io ioday t he  Ambassador to L ondon.   So again,  it  was our de cision to do some t hing 
in orde r t o avoid t hat a Nazi could be in Brusse ls to c hange  t he  spirit of t he European 
Committee.
 
Q:
 
If my re collect ion is correct you we re  not  arre ste d in the  Achenbacke r case .
 
A:
 
No,  I took my son Arno, at  t hat t ime  he  was small.  When I was in Ge rmany whe re  I had my 
mee t ings,  campaigning against  Kie singe r,  my Mothe r

Law was ofte n in charge of
 
Arno whe n I  
was away, so I decided to take him with me, he was with me against Kiesinger.  I remember 

t he re  was a pict ure  in t he  Ge rman ne wspape rs,  t he  3 more import ant c andidat es,  it  was 
Kie singer,  Klafste r and Brandt,  and Karsfe ld was Arno.  Eve n whe n we followe d Kie singe r in t he 
campaign,  t he  bus of journalist s following his Me rce de s and I wit h some of my group in 1 or 2 

cars,  and t he journalists said : ﬁ you know why Mrs. Karsfeld had to follow,  we  could t ake  her in 
t he  bus with t he me dia which could b
e a good ge st ure,  but I am afraid t hat  Arno c ould bit e me .ﬂ

Q:
  
Am I corre c t to say t hat in 1970 you we re  jaile d in Warsaw and in 1971 in Prague?
 
A:
 
Yes, at this time I have to tell you that I became known in East Germany by the fact of 
doc ume nt s c once rning Kie singe r and docume nt s I  had from the Propaganda Ministry and t he se  

doc ume nt s had be e n in East Ge rmany in Postdam  and whe n we  start e d the  Kie singe r campaign 
we  did not  want to go to East  Ge rmany and could t e ll t he ir spie s, so my husband we nt t o the  
police  in France  and to t he  Ministry of Just ice  t o say: my wife was fire d from the Ge rman Office  

be cause  she  said t hat  Kie singe r was a Nazi and now we  have  to prove  it .   I  hav
e  to go to East  
Germany because the documents are there.  I have to tell you I am not sympathetic of East 

Ge rmany and I  am not  a spy but  I  have a ne e d for the  docume nts,  but so you know East 

Ge rmans are  very happy to have  young germans taking t he  German Ca
pitalists me n and t he  

Ge rman Nazi Part y but also had t he irNazis,  not so import ant, and afte r the e nd of t he  war whe n 
t he  Russians came  most  of t he  Nazis told t he ant icommunist s le ft Easte rn Europe  and part  of 
them went to the Western Allies.  Because of my
 
Kiesinge r campaign I be came  a he roine  and 
after Kiesinger was defeated we turn to the Eastern part of the country and we saw there was 
anti
-
Se mitism in Poland and Cze choslovakia mainly at  the  t rial against  t he Nazis,  the  

government  said t hat  t he  biblical 
names of these youngsters were Jewish in order to say Jewish 
spirit  and so I de cided first t o go to Warsaw to prote st against t he ant i
- 
Semitism of t he Polish 
government, and for sure I was arrested, expelled the next day because I was an embarrassment 

for
 
t he m and I  re peate d in Prague  on t he We nce slaus square ,  was arre st e d and this time  put in 
jail for 2 days and expe lle d and t he n I came back t o East  Ge rmany the day I he ard the  doors are  
closed.  They did not want to take me back because I was not right to
 
prote st  against  anti
-
Se mitism in Poland and Czec hoslovakia and so I said: you know I am nit  asking bec ause  I want to 
have  a revie w for you, I have  my own propositions and my own moralit y t o fight  against Nazis 
and you share  my vie ws, but t o fight against  
anti
-
Semit ism you have  to share  my vie ws too and 
we  are  all Ge rmans,  East Ge rmans t oo you be long to the  Ge rman people , you are living today in 
t he  East e rn part but  all Ge rmany de clare t he  war and the  Je ws and t he re  was no more  sharing 

my views and I said this must be  all Ge rmans fight ing agains Nazis and not  allow forme r Nazis to 
have  import ant funct ions and to fight  against ant i
-
Semit ism and to stand on the side of the State  
of Israe l and you know what  was the  situat ion ofIsrae l if Germany and t he Unite d Nations in t he 
e nd voted against it and I  took my libe rt y eve n I  be came  ???? but I  am inde pe nde nt  and I  will 
always do all what my only convict ion ask me  to do.
 
Q:
 
Could you te ll me  in a few words what  was your involveme nt in the  Lischka case , the  forme r 
co
mmandant  of t he  ?SDE? in Paris,  t he  kidnapping atte mpt t hat you trie d to do with your 
husband?
 
A:
 
The  Lischka case  was about his high re sponsibility for the  fat e of the  Jews of France ,  the  Ge rman 
who had he lpe d wit h the  Vichy gove rnme nt had dec ide d the  arre st and de portation of the Je ws 
from France , 76, 000 we re  de port e d, and after the Ache nbac ke r case  we le arne d that Brandt was 

signing a ne w t re aty wit h France  in orde r to obtain t he  possibility to dash t he  disc riminate rs of  
the 200 sentences after the war by the military courts, but there were no ways to sentence 
them because as German citizens in France they asked to extradite them, but as German  

citizens they were not expelled to France, at this time the French Military Courts could still 
sentence them,and the French after the war had in a first review asked the German not to take 
care  of t hem be cause t hey we re afraid that se nte ncing t he m,  in Ge rmany in military courts in 

abse nt ia,  to life  in prison or t o de at h,  but ne ve r caught,  but  Ge rmany se nte ncing t
hem to life, so 
there was a kind of blocking therefore no sentences in France or Germany.  We had to find a 

solution.  The treaty between both countries was signed and now needed the ratification by the 

Ge rman Parliame nt and who was blocking t his rat ification our frie nd Ache nbacke r le ade r of our 

Party,  lobbying to stop all pe rse c ut ions of the se criminals,  so we  st art e d a c ampaign t o,  wit h 
slightly ille gal act ions,  we  showe d t he  big scandal and we  st arted t o assemble around us 
militant s, Je ws,  fight e rs,  deport ee s,  and our act ion was t o oblige first  t he  Ge rman Parliame nt to 

ratify the treaty and the needs then went to Germany to demonstrate in front of the office 
st at ing t hat Lischka was t he  forme r Chie f of Police in France ,  he  was alre ady the  Chie f of t he  
Ge s
t apo in Germany; in orde r t o obt ain t he  ratificat ion,  frie nds,  young Je ws in Ge rmany 

de monst rate d about  t he real criminals, e x
-
criminals to be  put  in Ge rman jails or expelle d 
whateve r but not hing happe ne d.  The public opinion and the  pre ss at  t his t ime  was
 
much more 

favorable  to us st ating t hat t he  sit uat ion was not  support able, France  also said how is it possible  
t hat Ge rmany le ts the criminals fre e  and and in Israe l you can imgine  the  Press,  and we  had a 
couple  of ye ars to fight  and finally t he t re at y was
 
rat ifie d,  Mr. Ac he nbacker was expe lle d from 
his posit ion as Preside nt  of Commission of Fore igh Affairs and t hen we  had t o st ruggle  again 
with t he Ge rman Justice  yo obtain t he  trial of Lisc hka who was a former Chie f with Eichman and 
?Einse imer? who was t he
 
deputy to the Chief of anti
-
Je wish,  was a young man, all had be e n 
brilliant me n who had st udie d Philosophy or Journalism and he was one of t he  worst physically 
be cause  he arre st e d e lde rly Je ws,  took the m from Jewish Hospitals and he  was in charge   of 
chil
dren in Drancy before their deportation.  So we worked from 1971 when the treaty between 
Franc e  and Ge rmany was signe d t o 1979 whe n t he  trial was ope n in Cologne .   We had 
conduct e d seve ral de monst rations put t ing our lives in dange r but finally obtaining Ju
stice for the 
criminals, we collected all the documents giving them to the French Prosecutor and to the 
Ge rman Prosecut or and finally t he t rial st arted.  It was import ant ,  the re we re  t housands of 
Youngste rs coming from Franc e  to Ge rmany, to Cologne,  in fro
nt of t he t rial and we  had shown 
our de te rminat ion we will ne ve r t ole rate  an acquittal of t hese  thre e  me n,  we aske d for the ir 
sentence.  You asked aboit the kidnapping of L ischka , I said that from 1971 to 1979 we acted 
and whe n t he situat ion was bloc ke d I
 
said : you know we  are  to kidnap Lischka and we  will bring 
him bac k to Franc e whe re  the  Military Courts c an still se nt e nce  him in France , as we  never be e n 
profe ssional kidnappe rs, nor some  young Jews, I had pre[pared a cont rolling time t able  of 
Lischka,  wh
e n he le ft in t he morning to go t o t he office,  coming back for lunch,  going back to t he 
office , with some information we  had we  re nt e d a c ar, not  a car for kidnapping be cause it  was a 
sport car,  you c an imagine  how t o put a big man in a sport car and the n 
the first attempt was 
done ,  doing it  was not det ermine d to hit Lischka so it faile d, t he  group came back in the morning 
be cause  we  did not  want to give  up,  that  made  a big scandal,  pe ople  wat ching t hat we  wante d 
t o kidnap this man and we  all re turne d t o Fr
ance and we sent a letter to the German Prosecutor 
saying you know the re was a group of Jews who wante d t o kidnap a man like L ischka who was a 
Nazi criminal so t he y had to do some t hing,  they we re ve ry embarrasse d be cause  t he y had 
known about  Lischka in Cologne ,  and I  said you know if you do not  want t o do some thing I  can 
come  to Cologne  and t e ll you what to do,  and I  came  with docume nt s,  prese nted myse lf to t he  

Prose c utor saying he re  I am,  so he was oblige d to arre st  me, so I was in jail,  t hs was always to 
push a case  of anot her criminal to be conde mn not be cause  we  had se nt a pe tit ion to t he  
Ge rman Parliame nt  or to the  Ge rman Jut ice ,  but  because  we had put our de te rminat ion,  our 

own comfort  and our own life  on t he  spot  in orde r to obtain t his.
 
Q:
 
How long d
id they ke e p you in jail in Cologne?
 
A:
 
The  first time  I was in jail for 3 we eks,  by t he way I was t oget he r wit h some body H. Brownste in 

who had bee n expe lle d from t he  Unit e d St ate s,  had be en marrie d aft e r t he  war to an Ame rican 
soldie r, le ft  for t he  US, was living in Brooklyn and she  was aware  of a guard of t he  Maide ne k 
Camp and was in t he samw prison (Ose ndorf),  she was an e lde rly woman looking ve ry friendly, 

she  was knit t ing for a se rvice  in t he prison, you would ne ver t hought  of he r as a guard in 

Maidene
k,  she  was se nte nce d for life  in a t rial in Ge rmany to push anot he r case,  but  in orde r to 
att ract public  opinion, t he  fact  she was in jail at the  same time  I was in jail.
 
Q:
 
I will ask you,  ple ase ,  to t alk about t he  Barbie  case ,  t his is a case  strongly lin
ke d to your name 
and t o Se rge  Klarsfe ld name  and I t hink it  was as famous as t he Kie singe r case , it is highly 
symbolic  and ve ry import ant  for France coming to face  it s past ,  also for Gemany.  So if you be  so 

kind tell us at length the Barbie case.
 
A:
 
The B
arbie case st art e d whe n we were  in charge  of t he  L isc hka,  t he  criminals se nte nce d in 
abse ntia in France,  as Klaus Barbie  he  was t oo,  he  was t he  Ge st apo in Lyon and by t he  way in 

1980 he and Lischka were sentenced to 30 years term of jail, but at this time while we were in 

Germany to obtain the sentence for high responsibility for the fate of Jews in France started the 
Barbie case and it started because the Jewish Documentation Center received from the 
Prose cutor in Munich who de c ide d to close the  case of K,
Barbie t o sat isfy the  group whic h 
de c ided to e nd the  past regime  in Ge rmany in a court in Munich for exe cut ing resistant  fighte rs 

and for having de porte d t he  44 Jewish childre n from Izie ux,  France  to Auschwitz and t he  
Prose c utor who st udie d the  file ,  noi q
uite a lot,  but st ill what  was det e rmine d for us the  de cision 
was se t : we cannot  sue K. Barbie , t he Chie f of the  Ge stapo in L yon,  for t he  killing of resist ant 

fight e rs as it cannot be prove n,  late r we found it  was not so,  and for the  case s of t he  Jewish 
ch
ildre n for t he  Prose cutor the re  was no proof t hat K.Barbie  ,  Chie f of t he  Ge stapo in Lyon,  in 
1944, in April 1944,  a couple  of mont hs be fore  the  liberation of France ,  had known t hat t he 
Je wish childre n,  most  orphans be cause the ir pare nts have  bee n de port e d
 
be fore,  had known 
t his me ant gasse d ,  so if you can say t hat  Barbie  c an se nd childre n who are not  able t o work, 

who are  not  se nt  for labor,  what  was t he dire ct ion of the  prose cutor in Cologne that Lishka and 

?????? the y also had to prove  that  in Ge rmany t
hey had known that deported Jews were for this 
and not for pleasure.  So we decided that the decision of the prosecutor to wait, gave no hope 

be cause  we  kne w Barbie  did not  live d in Ge rmany and was somewhe re in Sout h Ame ric a,  but 

we did not know where and we decided we have to wait.  I went to Cologne no to Lyon (excuse 
me )  and I  mobilize  public opinion ,  Lyon was t he  City in France  but Barbie  was not known for 
t he  killing of Jewish children se nt  to Auschwit z,  he was known because   he  had killed Je an 

Mouli
n,  t he  Chie f of the  re sistance  in France ,  t he re  was a group of the  frie nds of Je an Moulin, so 
I start e d saying we  have t o do some thing against  this de cision be cause  we c annot tole rate  t hat 

t his man c an be  morally acquitt e d by t he  Ge rman prose cutor; and I h
ad re sist ant fight e rs,  young 
Je ws,  and we  we nt to Munic h,  we had colle cte d new docume nt s, the re was somebody in Lyon a 

lawye r whom we  me t and we  said you  have  to he lp us,  we have  to bring t he proof to the  
Ge rman prose cutor that Barbie  has known,  if not no
t hing can be  done  against  him,  ye s he  said I  
re me mbe r one  day Icame  to see  as a Jewish le ader, came  to see  Barbie , and said t he  Je ws will 
be  e xe cute d ple ase pe rhaps you can put t hem to be se nt to East,  as a change they can survive  
and Barbie  re plie d e xe cut
ing on the spot os all t he  same anyway de at h,  it  is proof that  se nding 
childre n of I zie ux to Auschwit z me ant kille d but  not  only this argume nts we re  nee de d for t he 
German prosecutor, there were demonstrations of resistant fighters, and the youth Mme. 
Biguy
?????? ?????that children were deported from the cjildren™s home, she had been deported 

t o Auschwitz but survive d,  she  and I  start e d a hunge r strike  in front of the  prosecut or office 
saying we  are not le aving this spot  as long as you open t he  Barbie case a
nd the docume nts he  
did not want to look before, but as he saw these 2 old Jewish women sitting there in the street 
wit h blanket s around them ,  he  could not be cause  these  2 old ladie s may collapse ,  so he  said I ™ ll 

look at these files and decided to open th
e  case .  This was the first moral ste p he had,  
ne wspape rs carried the  news,  one  came  to a man who live d in Lima Pe ru,  and saw t he photo of 

Barbie ,  photo during the  war and he  said: you know I  t hink he  looks like  a Bolivian busine ssman 

who is living in Chil
e and he  cont acte d t he prose cutor,  he  cont acte d me  and se nt us the  photo of 
t he  Bolivian busine ssman, the n Y we nt  to se e t he  Ge rman prose cutor and said: you know t he re 
is a possibilit y t hat t his man is K.Barbie  and he  said Mrs. Klarsfe ld you will do your w
ork in 
France  and find wit ne sse s against  K. Barbie and the ide nt ificat ion of t his busine ssman and I will 

t ry to ge t  all t he  informat ion about Barbie  conce rning his family and t he ide nt ity of t his Bolivian  
busine ssman K. Eitmann?? the y are  comple te ly ide nt ical in the  pe rsonal information about t he 
Barbie  family and so I said all t he  thing to do is ask Franc e  to ask for t he e xt radit ion of Barbie  to 

Lima, but did not want so I decided to take the information and go to Lima and see the Minister 
of Justice .   I  c
ame  to Lima,  Barbie  le ft for Bolivia and I followe d him t he re  and t he proof I had 
we re so strong,  I saw Justice  in Bolivia,  saw the  Dire ctor of Police  and the y we re  convince d that 
t he  busine ssman Eitmann was K>  Barbie eve n t hough Barbie  continue d to de ny o n TV I am not 
K. Barbie ,  I have neve r been in Franc e  de port ing Jewish childre n but  finally he  was oblige d,  and 
again this was on the spot  as we learned later the American Secret Service and the French they 

alol had known that Eit mann is Barbie and living in Bolivia,  but again we  had to move public 
opinion,  to make  it public and t his was my first trip; my second t rip as we  had no suc ce ss in 
orde r to obtain the  e xt radition of asking France ,  and I me t a se cond Je wish woman Mm. A.  

Brune ll??? Who had bee n de port e d by orde r of Barbie  from I zie ux,  he r husband had be e n 
e xe cute d by  Barbie in Lyon and we  de monst rat e d and ask for the  support  of t he Bolivian public 
opinion to ask Bolivia to ext radite  him to France  and unfortunat e ly as Bolivia was rule d by a 

dict ator we  had no c hanc e , but  we followe d the Barbie  case ,  as I say, it  always t ake s a long t ime 
but we  ne ver gave  up and in t he  80™ s t he  dict ator had t o go and a socialist came to powe r in 
Bolivia and we  had now anot he r approach t o t he  government  of France ,  Mr. Mi
t te rand to do 

some t hing in orde r t o obtain t he  expulsion of K.Barbie from Bolivia to France and you know 
from t he ve ry be ginning to t he  e nd we  are  always involve d and pushing,  so Barbie was e xpe lle d 
t o France  and the re  was a trial.  We publishe d a book with Mr. Rivie ux??? Be cause  Barbie  was 

represented by a defender ??Verges??who is anti
-
Israeli and who alre ady claimed t hat t he 
childre n of I zie ux de port at ion was false and we  had to prove  t hat t he childre n live d t he re,  we re  
de port e d and kille d , we  publishe d
 
the book,the children of Izieux, in the US too, andhe was 
sentenced to life in prison because due to our efforts from the very beginning to the very end.
 
Q;
 
Thinking about Maitre Verges, what was his motivation?
 
A:
 
He is one who likes to be ﬁ avocat du di
able ﬁ, you know he  has no morals,  he  came  from t he le ft 
a communist ,  move d to the  right ,  he is ant i
-
Israel,  anti
-
Se mitic,  and so he  saw the  c ase   of 

K.Barbie  and Barbie would say lot s of things pre judic ial about  fighte rs who betraye d Je an 
Moulin.

Q:
 
Le t ™ s go back to t he Barbie  t rial and spe cialy to his lawye r,  how did he  work,  what are  your 
fe e lings about  him, why did he  take t his case?
 
 
A:
 
I think he  was take n by t he  fact  he  would have a c ase ,  also he migh
t had a sympathy for K.  
Barbie and he was paid by the daughter of Barbie who tried to collect money for the defense of 
her Father, it was a ??? in Switzerland who did work who helped ?Forcette? to get some money 

t o de fe nd K. Barbie ,  he also was anti
-
Semiti
c,  had a sympat hy for Barbie ,  and he  also wante d t o 
have  a scoop,  and t he  scoop was to say t hat Barbie  would embarrass whole  France  be cause  he 

will reve al t he  se cret s of t he  Fre nc h re sist ance ,  who be traye d Je an Moulin,  t his had not bee n 

reviewed before, so
 
we  always said we  are ve ry much affe c te d by this declaration,  which is not  
t rue ,  be cause  Barbie  has nothing to say,  he still knows but  he  forgot quit e a lot too, he  had said 

alre ady in inte rvie ws, in his memoirs, and the re fore no new informat ion was avail
able .   Whe n 

finally the  trial start e d all we re  convince d that he is a liar trying to at tract  t he  me dia on t his t rial 
and on himse lf,  be c ause  he is a man full of himse lf,  his clie nt,  I would say, is a se cond person,  
first Ve rges ? the n his client ,  he  advise
d him ve ry badly, not  to come to court ,  for us good 
because Barbie would have been for in every session been able to embarrass the witnesses or to 
embarrass the deportees who survived, and it was good for the people who came to testify not 
to have this kil
le r in front of them.  But it was a position of Ve rge s? And too ofte n  wit h t he se  
kind of lawye rs who want  a polit ical significanc e ,  ne ver working t he file s,  did not look in t he  
Barbie  case ,  did not  look in the  files and he  obtaine d life  in prison, t he  max
imum he could obt ain 
for his c rime s.  
 
 
 

Q:
 
If Barbie  could have  bee n in c ourt  could he have  rece ive d a lighte r se nt e nce  t han life  in prison.
 
 

A:
 
I would say t hat  if Ve rge s would have looke d at  the  files he  could have  gott e n le ss t han life  in 
prison,  if K.
 
Barbie  would have  had the att itude  ???? and t he  man asking for ﬁpardonﬂ I  am sure  
t hat in front of t he jury  he  could had anot he r action but  he  was full of himself,  aggre ssive ,  

arrogant against t he  witnesse s and the  survivors and embarrasse d dot h Ve rge s and K. Barbie ™ s 
part y wit h young people  and t he y dec ide d the  pe nalty.
 
 
 

Q:
 
For t he Barbie affair you t rave lle d seve ral t ime s to Latin Ame rica t racking him down and to 
convince  authorit ies of seve ral count rie s t o coope rat e with the  Fre nch authorities for 
ext
radition,  my unde rst anding is t hat  you we re  involved in ot he r ac tivit ies in L at in Ame rica,  

spe cially in the  mid
-
eighties on issues like protecting against torture, we can remember cases in 
Arge ntina,  am I correct?
 
 
A:
 
Yes, I have been as a German to the up
pe r class,  be cause  as always not as an Arge nt inian,  t he 
disappearance of people, and among them there were Jews, There was a terrible anti
-
Semit ism,  
so I  went t o prote st to t he effe c t t hat  pe ople are disappe aring and I  st arte d to bring t he  
me ssage  as a Ger
man who always fought for just ic e .   I  brought  ove r my message ,  but in the se 
cases you cannot change immediately something, there were lots of protests, I am the person, I 
made  myse lf so, But  I am not a Minister,  had any political funct ions, but  if people with political 

funct ions would take  t he  same de cision,  not to go just  to see  the  Arge nt inian Ambassador in 
Paris,  but to go on t he  spot t o prote st  the  message  would go t hrough around the world,  would 
e mbarrass t he dic tator you are  fight ing,  so I t ook the  decision t o go t o Arge nt ina as I did in ot he r 

countrie s too, to say what I am saying on t he spot.   Which me ans I  am not  afraid t o come and 
say to the enemy on the spot.
 
 
 

Q:
 
With your pe rmission let™ s go back t o Europe  and talk about  t he Waldhe im case , you w
ere 
he avily involve d in this case  and we  would like to he ar what  happe ned.
 
 

A:
 
We  had bee n approache d by diffe re nt journalists,  during t hat  t ime  he  was Se cretary Ge ne ral of 
the United Nations, and they asked us about files against Kurt Waldheim, but you kn
ow he  was 
not  a big spot in t he  Nazi care e r,  so in our fie ld we  had no informat ion about  K. W. ,  we  se nt t he 

journalist s to Wie se nt hal,  he  had docume nt at ion, he  is in Vie nna,  will know about his Nazi past 

which ce rtainly would be in Vie nna and Wiese nt hal should know,  the n the people  came  back to 
us saying t hat Wiese nt hal said he  is a pure man  he has not hing against him.  So,  late r,  many 
pe ople  in Vienna had known his c are er during t he  war, so we finally,  we  ne ver became involve d 

why Wiesenthal never gave the
 
documents, he had known certainly at the time, it was that he 
did not  have  the  docume nts or want e d to prote ct Waldhe im I  cannot be  sure , but whe n 

Waldhe im was running for Pre side nt in Aust ria and the  Je wish Congress starte d to do re se arch 
in the archives in Washington and it  was re ve ale d t hat he  was a newsman and kne w what  had 
happened to the partisans who gave information, so it was like in the Kiesinger case, that it was 
t hat  the ???? unfort unat ely nobody knows,  the people  who could influe nce  t he  de cisio
ns of the  
UN did not  know his past,  buy now t hat he  was running for the A ustria Preside ncy people  said 
he  could not  tolerate  and had to do some thing.   I nformat ion was known and le afle ts we re 
publishe d about  his past,  nobody could say we do not know what Waldhe im had done  during 

t he  war,  and I de cide d as always t o go t o Vie nna ,  to Aust ria and mobilize  on t he  spot,  so I we nt 
t he re  with a couple of addre sse s of moveme nt s, I  got  some youngste rs around me ,  young 
people of the left movement; by the way in one d
emonstration we had to pose  as Kiesinge r and 
in the office  of that move ment I  found poste rs whe re the y we re marching a couple  of mont hs 

be fore , whe n the re was the  war of L e banon and Israel.
 
 
 

Q:
 
Would you be  so kind to e xplain what is your pe rce ption about
 
Simon Wie se nt hal lack of 
re act ion,  to put  it  mildly,  in re gard to t he  Waldheim affair?  What  was t he  motivat ion of his 
caut iousne ss?
 
 
A: 
 
As I said e it he r he had no docume nts, but I  do not  think so,  be cause  when Waldhe im was 
running for t he  Pre side ncy sud
de nly all t he Socialist s in Vienna,  in Aust ria,  had the  doc ume nts 
on Waldhe im and t he y used the se  docume nts hoping that  wit h the  past  of Waldhe im as a war 

criminal t he  Aust rians would not  vot e  for him,  but unfortunate ly t he y did,  t hus t he  docume nt s 

were kn
own and ce rtainly Wie se nthal had the  docume nts too,  but you know living in a count ry 
like Austria he had been close to the Party of Waldheim, believe me they met together at 

re c e pt ions, so it  is e mbarrassing.  I t hink S. Wie se nt hal said once  that™s my home
 
Vie nna,  he  had 
never been attacked, our car was bombed, I received a bomb when I returned from Bolivia, it 
was a bomb wit h 500 grams of dynamit e  and 300 grams of nails, unfort unate ly my Mothe r

Law and my husband we re  at home , I  had gone  to a Confe re nce
 
to the  Sout h of France  wit h 
Arno, so t hey did not ope n the  parce l, if the y had opene d it both would have  been kille d.   So,  

maybe  he  did not  want  in a plac e  whe re  he  had a good life ,  he did not  want  to embarrass, so he  
did not  do anyt hing against Waldhe im,
 
and eve n whe n e ve rybody was convince d he  ne ve r had 
any aggre ssive  c ampaign against Waldheim.
 
 
 

Q:
 
Le t  us with your pe rmission le ave  Europe  to Damascus,  Syria and talk about Alois Brunne r,  who 
was he and why you we nt aft e r him.
 

 
A:
 
Alois
 
Brunne r is cert ainly the  worst of all t he criminals around,  who st arte d de port ing Jews from 
Aust ria,  from Be rlin he de port e d t he  Jews from Salonika, 46000 Je ws from Salonika,  he  was the  
Chie f of Drancy camp in Franc e ,  he  de porte d t he  Je ws from France ,  he  
t he n with a group of 
Austrians went to the South of France when the Italians retired and the amnesty was signed and 
lot s of Jews had take n re fuge  in t he  Sout he rn part  of France whe n it was rule d by t he  It alians,  
and so whe n t he Ge rmans t ook ove r it was Alois Brunne r who was se nt down to make  the great 
round up of Je ws, by t he  way my Fat he r

doc ume nt s he had signe d during t he  war,  i.e .  towards t he  e nd  whe n pe ople  of the  Soc ial 

We lfare went to mee t  him in orde r t o ask not t o arre st t he  Je wish Childre n around Paris  in 
Childre n™ s home s and t hey pleaded why de port  t hem at the  ve ry e nd,  but it  was t o fill up t he  
t rains for de port at ion,  so Brunne r™ s argume nt s was that  the se  c hildre n must be  ar
rested 
because  they are future terrorists, one day they™ll look for vengeance of their parents™ death.  
As a way also about  his mot ivation and anti
-
Semit ic  hate  of Jews whe n he  was in Damascus 
inte rview by a pape r of Munic h (t he  Bunde) he  said he had no re gre t s and he  would se nd t he  
Je ws again to de at h and t he y are  the devils of the e art h,  he neve r was  eve r   hiding his fe e lings 
against t he  Jews.  So,  t his man afte r bee n harbored in Egypt we nt  to Syria and we  had the  first 
approach to him whe n my husband de cide d t o go to Syria as a Je w and saying you know I  am 

Jewish but I want to tell you that the worst killer of the Jews is today in Damascus under the 
name  of ﬁFische rﬂ,  so t he Syrians we re  ve ry much embarrasse d,  he had no visa,  ??? me eting at 
t he  airport
 
and finally de cide d in orde r to cut the  Brunne r c ase t o e xpe l him and the n as we 
always do,  we do not give  up, and we nt  back to Syria.  I  have  bee n t wic e,  once I  mobilize on the  
spot,  I was standing in front  of t he  Minist ry of t he Interior asking t o le t the  Je ws leave Syria and 
e xt radite  Alois Brunne r,  my husband was in Syria again and we were  both arrest ed but  we  trie d 

on t he spot but  Syria is a country whe re  it  is ve ry diffic ult to find a conne ction with (journalist ic) 
re porte rs,  if someone of t he  re port
ers wants to make news about your protest they are cut by 
t he  secre t se rvice , by t he  ce nsorship,  , so we  did mobilize  on the  spot  in a ve ry difficult and 
dange rous country, we  had mobilize  outside,  we had obtaine d frie nds from the ??Junge n? 
community to bl
ock for 2 ye ars big financial aid for Syria be c ause t he  Jews during t his time  we re  
not allowe d to le ave Syria.  Alois Brunne r was not extradite d but  argume nts by the  Syrians are  
t he  following: be c ause  they all had to approach lots of politicians from Europe an Count ries 

asking t hem about  t hese  c ase s and about Alois Brunner,  we do not know this man,  he  is not  in 
Syria.  So what do you do? So there are all these reports of the secret service of Germany, of 
Franc e , and t he inte rview of The  Bunde  whe n he was phot ographe d in Damascus,  what more  do 

you want ? The Syrians t ook t he  at titude we  do not know this man so don™t  bot her us,  so we  
obtaine d t he  blocking from t he  ??Junge n?Parliament financ ial aid.  Se rge  obtained from t he 
Fre nch Just ice  from t he  commission??? Have  t o go t o Syria and to look around,  ge t  films and 

doc ume nt s on Ame rican Tele vision on t he  Brunne r case ,  but  you know the re  is an e nd for us 

be cause  we  are  unable  t o act  in a count ry whe re the re is a dict ator,  Assad is a dictator,  an Arab 
dict at or,  he  ha s a sympat hy for Alois Brunne r,  because  he  knows quit e  we ll whe re  he  is, and also 
we  had no support from we st e rn politicians, mainly as Syria belongs to the  group of Allie s in t he 
Gulf war,  the re  was no more  hope,  and eve n t hough Chirac was the  Pre side nt a
nd was t he  last 
one  who approache d Assad asking about Brunner,  t here  is no answe r, sure  you can obtain 
some t hing if you make  a polit ical or diplomatic boycot t of Syria, pe rhaps you could but no othe r 
count rie s eve n Ame rica would take  t he  risk to embarrass Assad bec ause  of Alois Brunner.  It  was 

possible  to obt ain t he expulsion of Carlos t he  int e rnational t errorist  who was first in Syria t he n 
in Yemen from where he was extradited but for Alois Brunner, even the Israelis, as today, there 
are more interested a
bout actual t e rrorist s against Israe l me aning Arabs,  so t he  case  of Alois 
Brunne r was ne ve r a priority for them.  So I do not  know,  as was said Brunne r might be de ad,  I 

do not  t hink so, I pe rsonally do not think t he re  will be a solution that  Brunne r will be  transfe rred 
t o a tribunal in a We ste rn count ry.   But  eve n though he  will die in Syria, no doubt about  it ,  it 
me ans t hat Syria was unt il the  e nd a country with Assad who harbore d and prote cte d one of t he  

worst  criminals of t he  Jewish pe ople .
 
 
 

Q:
 
Let us now move back to France, July 1993, Rene Bousquet the former Police of Vichy was shot, 
t his is why he  was ne ve r brought  to t rial,a trial that  was sche dule d to st art , but ne ve r took place 
be cause  he was kille d.   Can you t e ll us your involvement  in t he  Bousqu
et case?
 
 
A:
 
I t  st arte d be fore  in t he  70s. ,  in order to unmask his (dele gue ) second in the  occupie d zone  Je an 
Leguay, at this time he was still working for ?????in the United States.  I announced that the first 
t ime whe n I was in the  State s and he was indicte d,  he die d in his be d and afte r his de at h Fre nch 
Justice  made  public t he  indict me nt  and said t hat  if there  had be e n a trial against  Je an Le guay he  

would have  bee n sent e nced as criminal for crime s against humanity and t his was a big succe ss 
for us becaus
e  he  was conside re d a c riminal t his way.  Bousque t as the Chie f of t he  Vichy Police, 
we  obt aine d all the  docume nt s and de live re d them to  t he  Fre nch Justice be cause he had bee n 
sentenced and he was then excused because he had helped French Resistant Fighte
rs,  alt hough 
t he re  was t his ne w evide nce  against him it was the  opposit e of Je an Le guay who was indic te d 
and so in France  I t hink Se rge  did a lot  wit h t he publication of t he  book calle d Vichy
-
Auschwit z to 
show what was the role of the French Government and
 
t he  Fre nch Police in t he  arre st  and 
deportation of the Jews, because very often in France you have directives, I remember our 
butche r,  a woman she  liked ve ry much my Mothe r
-
in
-
Law knowing that  she  was Je wish, she said 
you know it  is t e rrible  what happe ne d
 
to the Je ws in France ,  t he Ge rmans did it!!  I t  is not true 
you know, most of the Jews in France were arrested by the French Police and this I think is the 

case of Rene Bousquet, because all these indictments made a lot of articles in the newspapers 
and in Franc e  newspape rs have  bee n ve ry he lpful to educate Fre nch Public Opinion and to show 

t he m what was t he  re sponsibilit ie s of t he Vichy Gove rnme nt and in the  Bousque t case  
unfort unat e ly a crazy man kille d him and I ce rt ainly fee l it would have be e n bet ter 
to have t he 
Bousquet case inst e ad of the  case of the  crazy man of ??? was unable  t o make  a polit ic al t rial,  
t he  Fre nch did not  want  to make  a polit ical t rial but our work was ve ry import ant  ,  as I said 

these trials, as in Germany  too, they are extremely i
mportant t o form public  opinion,  be cause  
the newspapers, the books, I cannot tell you how many books are written about Klaus Barbie, 

my husband says I ™ ll ne ve r write  a book about t he  criminal me n but about t he  vict ims and this 

has be e n ve ry he lpful eve n if
 
Bousque t and Jean L e guay had not  be e n se nte nced in front of a 
t ribunal,  but t he  French population unde rstood who had be e n t hose c riminals,  what t hey had 

done .
 
 
 

Q:
 
You are  ce rtainly right  saying that  t he Bousquet case  was highly symbolic be cause  it  e xpose
d 
one of the important institutions of the Vichy Government the Police, and the same was 
probably t he  c ase  of Paul Touvie r who repre se nte d the  Militia and in this c ase t oo you we re 
involve d and your husband.   Can you say a fe w words about it?
 
 
A:
 
I t  was my
 
son who took ove r to re pre se nt most of the assoc iate d plaintiffs in the c ase  of Paul 
Touvie r,  but  I remembe r it  was about  20 ye ars ago, he was still hiding wit h a group of (???) 
Int e rnational Le ague against  ??? anti Semitic, he was st ill living near Chamb
ery we were 
de monstrating in front  of his house but he  had alre ady le ft be cause  he  was hiding among t he   ? 

int e grus?  Cat holic Church,  t he y we re  harboring him,  he  had alre ady at t his t ime to 

prote st ???????and he  was amne stie d by Pre side nt Pompidoul at  this
 
t ime  as you re membe r 
Pre side nt   Mitte rand also had said in diffe re nt cases no more  t rials against Fre nch Collaborat ors,  

of Fre nc h High Officials in orde r not to embarrass the  Civil Peace  in France,  t hat was t he 

e xplanat ion give n, not to divide  t he  Fre nch 
populat ion pro and anti Vichy and so we  st art e d at 
t his t ime  and ha was arre ste d and eve n t hough whe n arre st e d in the Sout h part of France and 
the Police from Paris came over because the Police of the Cote D™Azur did not want yo act, there 

was informat ion 
going around ,  be cause  the  Police  told us t he  KLARSFELD GANG will come  and 
kidnap him,  so t he  Police  in Paris, so our fame ,  but  t he most important I think is the  trial whe n 
my son de fe nded most  of the  associat e d plaint iffs.  It was stat e d t hat :  In t he cas
e  he  decide d to 
e xe cute  the  Jews be cause  the y we re Je wish and in this case  he  did not  act unde r the  Ge rmans 

but  t ook this dire ct ion himse lf and t his was a big st ruggle  for t he  defe nding line  of Paul Touvie r 
who was se ntenced to life imprisonme nt.
