Beginning Ta pe One, Side A 
 
Question: We ll, do you have things you want to start with? 
Answer: We ll, fi rst of all I™d 
like to show my veracity. 

Q: But nobody™s questioning veracit
y, so I don™t understand what -- wh
at it is that you think you 
have to prove. I mean, what -- 

A: What -- what I -- what I like to
 do is start -- in order for my 
testimony, my recollections to be 
meaningful to any future researcher, there s
hould be no doubt in whoever is going to go through 

it mi nd, that the person that states these things 
ha d real access and is the person he represents 
hims elf to be. Now you say you don™t doubt who I am
. You s till don™t know 
me  from Ada m. As 
far as I™m co -- you™re concerned, I could have --
 I can be anybody. I could have [indecipherable] 
in the books. What proof do -- what -- you have 
no knowledge except my word that I am Jakuv 
Mozelsio, that I was born in Lódz 1924 and so 
on. But if I present you with document a tion, then 
you are my witness, as fa r as the future res
earchers are concerned. Y
ou follow my meaning? 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Okay. 

Q: Okay. 

A: Okay. All right, I can start o
ff by showing my  bi
rth certificate. 
Q: Did you have this during the whole period? 

A: What? 

Q: Your birth certificate? 

A: No, I obtained that from Lódz, a copy actually, in 1969. 
Q: So it™s Jakuv, J-a-k-u-v? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0463

A: Right. 
Q: M-o-z-e-l-s-i -- s-i-o. 

A: Correct. 

Q: Mozelsi o? 

A: Correct. 

Q: And it™s 4 - 11 - ™24, which -- and Rolfe is your father? 

A: Correct. 

Q: Okay. 

A: There™s a similar birth certificate 
of my sister, who is still alive,
 and she is -- 
right now is out 
in Los Angeles with her husband. 

Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh. And she is -- 

A: About three and a half years older.  

Q: Marion is three --  
A: -- right. 
Q: -- Marion Mozelsio, and born 16 - 4 - 1921. Also in Lódz. 

A: Right, and as you see, the most important thin
g, which ma kes me  so unique, is my father™s 
occupation. Because without my father™s occupati
on I wouldn™t be right now here, sitting talking 
to you. This is the key to my uniqueness. 

Q: Garbadz? 

A: Garbadge. 

Q: Garbadge. 

A: A leather tanner. 

Q: And you said there we re what
, three leather tanneries in -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0463

A: Ba -- there were basically f
our -- Lódz was a textile center.
 We  called the -- Lódz was called 
before the wa r, the Polish Manchester. And the ta
nneries were really a mi nor industry, the Lódz. 
There were four of them, all three Jewish ow
ned -- no, all four Jewish owned. Three of them 
specialized in what they call upp
er leather, supp leather, one sp
ecialized in so
le leather only. 
Q: In s -- in -- 
A: Sole leather. Shoe leather. 

Q: Oh, ah, ah, ah, sole. 

A: Sole. 

Q: Yes. 

A: My father™s tannery was the supp leather, 
upper leather. A
lthough he was a ma ster tanner and 
he could produce any type of leather. 

Q: Did you work in that 
-- in the tannery also? 
A: No, I did -- no, I wa -- I was b -- I 
was born in the tannery. We lived -- 
Q: Really in the tannery? 

A: Ah -- oh yea -- well, it was a compound that was 
in -- it was a -- that c
onsisted of the tannery 
and a housing complex. The housing -- the hou -- apartment house was occupied by partners and 

fa mily only. So I was actually born in the tann
ery, on the same  yard. And the tannery was a -- 
my playground, considering that we lived on the out
skirts of Lódz -- in Poland there was no such 

thing as suburbs, a city just gradually tapered ou
t. And it --  a leathe r ta
nnery being a smelly and 
pretty dirty business, was by necessi ty located so
me where where -- pretty far out, away from the 
center. 

Q: How doe s one get the -- the 
leat her?  The --  the skins?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0463  
4 
 
A: I™d say it™s a very comple
x process. You start the -- actua
lly, leat her is a -- they™r e two 
separate words. We start out with
 the hide, and when we say hide, we me an a skin of an animal 
beginning fro m the time when it™s removed fr om th
e carcass up til the tissues are saturated with 
some  che mi cal that will stop it fr
om deteriorating or rotting. That 
means -- we call it a hide. That 
part of process -- and i -- it™s 
a -- it™s a length -- it takes even
 today with mo dern me thods, it 
takes anywhere from four to six weeks to proces
s a hide into a finished
 product. And the reason I 
say today because in 1946 - ™47, I worked in a leat
her tannery in Philadelphia, for two years. And 
the process was virtually identical
. Matter of fact, the machine 
I worked, I -- I was assigned to, 
the particul ar  machine, was identical with th
e machine that we had back home , there was 
virtually no difference. The same  machine, sa
me thing, same way, same  me thod. So, ou call a 
hide all the way up to the tanning process. Th
e mi nute it™s tanned, that means the tissues are 
permeated with some  chemical, from then on it™s 
leather. And all consecutive stages of it, we 
talk in terms  of leather. Th
e tannery was my playground becaus
e there were only the Jews of 
Lódz resided in the city, in center city. And as 
you went out to the periph
eries, there were less 
and less Je ws. The peripheries were populated by blue
 collar Gentiles. Especially that the native 
Poles were a mi nority in Lódz. Lódz had 
close to a million population, some thing like 800,000. 
There was about 250,000 Jews, about a hun -- 200,000 
native Germans, which was termed in 
German the Volksdeutsch. So the Poles were rea
lly a mi nority. They were hi -- and there were 
streets in the city, when we talk about the cit
y, where -- apartment houses where the only Gentile 
was the jani tor. The entire apartment house comple
x was part -- occupi ed by Jewish families. For 
instance, the friend of mi ne w
ith whom I™m staying right now 
in Silver Spring he lived on 
Piotkowska 20, which is center ci
ty. And it was a gigantic apartment house, two courtyards, 
house at least six, 800 apartments. A
nd the only Pole was the janitor.

Q: And was this typical of the way in which th
e groups lived, that ther
e was mostly separation 
between the groups? 
A: Yes, yes, very much. 

Q: So you had no Gentile fr
iends, or [indecipherable] 
A: Well, well, in my case, there were on the --  to
 the best of my me mory, I lived on a dead end -- 
you know, it would help us, you have that ma p, it™ll 
be a great help if 
we could kind of -- 
Q: This is the ghetto, so -- 

A: No, this is the -- this is Lódz. 

Q: Oh, that™s Lódz. 

A: Right. Now keep in mi nd, I didn™
t ma ke that for you, this is a -- 
Q: Right, right, this is -- 

A: Matter of fact, this is part
 of a collage. This is one half of a collage that I ma de for my 
children.  
Q: So this is where the tannery was [indecipherable] 
A: Right, this is the -- this was the tannery, a
nd this is the ghetto 
boundary, the future ghetto 
boundary. The Jews really occupied densely, the ar
ea from Balloot mart -- market -- going this 
way, which would be -- this ma p is
 very wrong. This is north, okay? 

Q: Right, right, so going north. 

A: Going north. The center of the city was th
e s -- [indecipherable] is Freedom Square 
[indecipherable]. And that -- th
e densely populate -- the poorer Je
ws lived between Belt ma rk -- 
ma rket and that™s [indecipherable] more or less he
re. That -- that was Balotte, or  Balote. This is 
the old part of Lódz. And the new part of Lódz
 was centered more or less around Pietma  Center 
Piotkowska with all -- the 
sizes are not shown, this 
densely [indecipherable] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0463  
6 
 
Q: Right. 
A: And this was all Jewish populated. So you see 
us who come out here, that was very scarce. 

This little street -- we -- 
I live on a dead end street, and our factory compound was actually 
closing the street. 

Q: Uh-huh. And how do you pronounce that?  Quid -- 

A: Kwizinska. 

Q: Kwizinska. 

A: While the Poles were very hard Polanizing, actu
ally the original name  of the city -- of the 
street was feesh -- the Germans na med it duri
ng the 1917 occupation, Fishagossa. And then the 
Poles called it Walitsa Fishaira. Apparently Fisher
 must have been the man that st arted the 
[indecipherable]. But the Polani
zing pressure came  on, and e ver
ything got Polanized, so they 
done away with Fisher, and they -- up til ™39, a lo
t of people, Jews especially, st ill called it 
Fishagossa, not Kwizinska. 
Q: And why is there a number one to five here? 
A: Because that™s my legend. The lege nd is -- 

Q: Oh I see, I see, right. 

A: -- one to five, fall 1924, til wi
nt er ™39. And then January 20
th
, 1945 to October ™45. 
Q: To October, right, okay. 

A: Because I left --  

Q: You just -- you left the pl
aces in this [indecipherable] 
A: Right, I left the -- I wa s born there, and I o
ccupied a little of the 
premises til November, 
December ™39. Then I relocated [indecipherable]10 in the ghetto. And eventually, on the 19
th
 of 
January, when I was liberated by the 
Red Ar my, I just went back home. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0463  
7 
 
Q: Right. 
A: And I spent, again, th-the period between January 20
th
 and October ™45, or when I left Lódz 
and Poland permanent. I was again at
 Kwizinska in my original home. 
Q: And is your father here most of the time, or
 is he -- is the tan -- is the tannery moved? 

A: As of right now? 

Q: No, no, no. I mean, when you mo ved here [indecipherable] 

A: Well -- wa -- what -- wa -- wa -- 

Q: Or ma ybe we should go back farther. 

A: We ll, what happened was the tannery was -- my father was a person with no formal  

education. He only attended a chaider, traditional ch
aider. However, he was self educated in his -
- in his teens, he -- he was born into a very 
religious Orthodox fa mil
y. My grandfather was a 
Hassid, a follower of the Alexander [indeciphera
ble] which makes him a real Hassid, he ma de 
annual pilgrima ges to the court of the rabbi.I don™t know whether you™re familiar with these 
things, are you? 
Q: Well -- 

A: I -- I mean, I™m -- I™m talking, but I don™t 
know whether I should say these things -- 
Q: Sure. 

A: -- because you know them, or whether -- 

Q: No, no, you s -- just explain. 

A: And so my grandparents had -- my paternal
 grandparents had about 
eight, nine children. I 
believe five boys and -- six boys 
and two girls. And the boys were
 of the pretty independent 
mi nd, and my grandfather was a very strict person
. Especially that -- back then -- we talk now 
about the late 1800, beginning 1900, children were cons
idered a labor asset. So as soon as the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0463  
8 
 
kids reached an age of let™s say 
eight or so, my gr andfather put 
them to work. And they worked 
for him til they reached the age of reason, which would be some thing like 12 or 14, and at the 
age of 14, they simply disappeared. My father
 hims elf was the second born, and he run away 

from home  a t  the age of 14. Pretty far, too. 
He run away all the way 300 miles away. And he 
stayed away til he  was 19. At the age of 19 he wa s -- at the age of 14 he was self supporting. He 

had the trade that he  learned between the age 
of nine and 14 from my
 gra ndfather, in my 
grandfather™s shop. He was so good that he was hire
d as a expert, or expe
rienced worker. And he 
didn™t come home til he was 19 where he
 could stand up to my grandfather. 
Q: And all the boys did this, they all -- 

A: And all the boys except the youngest one, did the same  thing. 

Q: Wa s he physically rough on 
them as a [indecipherable] 
A: We ll, corporal punishment was normal and e
xpected and accepted. In addition, this is the 
period when you™re going to look at it this way, 
that really Poland was feudal. Renaissance and 
the Napoleonic era did not come  to Russian occ
upied Poland at all. So Poland was basically 
feudal. However, the Jews, western Jews and 
Russian Jews, embraced a movement called the 
Haskallah, if you™re familiar with it. 

Q: Why don™t you explain. 

A: Enlighten ment. They felt that  the future is in
 aligning themselves with the new era that went 
along with the -- Napoleon™s armi es of education,
 of reaching for more material aims. So my 
father, while I guess he was absent from home
, he did embrace the Haskallah movement, the 
enlightenme nt and he taught hims elf how to read 
German, how to read Polish. He read -- was wi 
-- he read a lot Polish -- in Polish, a lot in Ge
rman. Whether it was -- I don™t think there was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0463  
9 
 
much choice, you read whatever was available. 
Even in my time, I read anything that was 
available. I was not particular. 

Q: Tell me , did your father™s sisters r
un away too, or was it [i ndecipherable] 
A: No, th-they stayed home . And then I think wh
en my father was about 18 or 19, he embraced 
the Tolstoyan philosophy. He became a follower 
of Leo Tolstoy. As you know, Leo Tolstoy was 
not also a auth -- not also
 -- not only an author, but he also 
formed a specific way of life. I think 
there™s still a foundation some where upstate New York
 that wa s run by his sister -- fa -- by his 
daughter, sure. I wa -- I passed by Binghamt on a nd 
I saw si -- a sign on the outskirts of bir -- 
Binghamt on, some thing about Tolstoy and thereis the foundation still 
there functioning. And 
that™s why my father, for example, ne -- was not a smoker. My father did not smoke , that was 

part of that Tolstoyan wa y of life. No whiskey 
[indecipherable] just didn™
t drink, either way. He 
was not a glutton. That™s again the Tolstoyan principle, don™t overeat. Eventually he -- while he 

embraced it in his formative years, therefore it -- 
some  of it, some  principles of it stayed with 
him for the remainder of his 
life. It also involved some  
intangibles like honesty, like 
forthrightness. It™s a -- it™s a way of life. Tolst
oy for mulated a complete way of life, to lead a 
clean life, both ways, physically and philosophica
lly. Eventually my father
 became  a member of 
the bund, that was the Jewish Socialist Worker™s move me nt. And he was capable, while my 

father™s ancestors, that ™s my gr
andfather, I imagine even people before my grandfather, were all 
leather tanners because in the me dieval time s,
 tanning was one of the few trades -- [phone 
ringing] -- Is this going on? 

Q: Oh yeah. 

A: Oh. I didn™t know, I thought we we
re just talking preparatory. 
Q: No, no, no, no. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0463  
10 
 
A: Tanning -- I don™t know whether -- a-again, y
ou know quite a bit about me because I sent 
some  ma terials. I don™t know anything about
 you. I don™t know how muc h knowledge and what 
areas of Jewi sh history is your 
expertise. So I™m really -- 
Q: You have to tell me  everythi ng, because you™re not just talking to me . When you put 
some thing -- 

A: But a -- but a -- I don™t know how much a m I 
repeating my self and it 
sounds to you like old -- 
old story. 

Q: No, you mi sunderstand some thing. When you do so
me thing for an interview, even if I know 

things, like what Haskallah is, it™s very im
portant that you explain, 
because you never know who 
is going to listen and what they understand. So you 
must explain as if I k
now very little. That™s 
the point. 

A: All right, let™s -- let™s make a deal. 

Q: Yeah, yeah. 
A: When I use a word like -- a term like Hask
allah and then offer an explanation, if you know 
about Haskallah, and you don™t think that my expl
anation of [indecipherable] me  stands for, 
correct me , cause I don™t want to sound like a 
fool. So if you do know about Haskallah from 
other sour ces, am I correct 
in the way I presented it? 
Q: Yeah, I think it™s a ger -- I mean, I™m not -- 
I -- I -- I mean, I™m not an expert in Jewish 
history. 
A: Well, it translat es into -- 

Q: Yeah. 

A: -- enlightenme nt, yeah. 

Q: Enlightenme nt, right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0463

A: Anyway, going back to medieval times as we 
just should do, the medieval girls di d not accept 
Jews, and there were very few trades available permitted to the Jews. The Jews were limited to 
money changing, trade, some  thing -- whatever
. But not skilled craftsme n. One of the few 
exceptions in crafts and trades was leather tann
ing. It was dirty, was filthy, the way it was done 
in medieval times, and it required a gr eat amount 
of skill. And apparently the me dieval Gentile 
had no inclination either to get hims elf all dirt
ied up with filthy rotting rawhides, nor put his 
mi nd to the comp -- to the complexities of tanning, converting a raw hide  into a fini shed product. 

So that was one of the trades open to Jews, a
nd my grandfather was a medieval leather tanner. 

However, he did not ma ke a go out of it in 
his adult -- young adulthood. And he had to support 
his family by other means. My grandm other des
cended -- dese -- is a descendant of the first 
settlers in Lódz. My grandmother™s name  -- ma
iden name  was Lieverma n, however there was, 

because there were so few Jews in [indecipherabl
e] intermarriages in fa
milies were common, and 
her stepfather™s name  was Hanoch 
ódzki -- 
ódzki. 
ódzki means, of Lódz. Therefore, if we go 
back to let™s say 1820, when Jews only had the -- th
e given name s, and they had to be identified 
by some  kind of a surname or a handle, this was Hanoch from Lódz. 
ódzki is an adjective. 
Q: How do you spell it? 

A: Well, the word -- the letter L -- 

Q: L with a slash. 

A: -- with a slash is pronounced ew, like a W.  

Q: And it™s sky at the end? 

A: L-o-d-z-k-i. 

Q: K-i. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0463  
12 
 
A: And always a -- with a sl
ash on top which ma kes it a U. 
ódzki. Just like Jakuv could be 
spelled two ways. I can spell Jakuv with a U, or
 in Poland I did not spell Jakuv with a U. In 
Poland we spelled Jakuv with an O with a vertical slash above it. Poles use the U two different 
ways. So his name  was 
ódzki which definitely puts his ancestr
y way back into the first settlers 
of Lódz. And he was quite -- and her fa mily was 
quite prosperous. Apparently my grandfather™s 

fa mily was not prosperous. He was born in a lit
tle town of Skierniewice, so mewhere within I 
would say 20 - 30 mile. It™s a haml et. And the marriage must have been a brokered ma rriage, as 

all the ma rriages back then were. A usually youn
g man went for the dowry. I mean, let™s call a 
spade a spade. So apparently my grandmother™s 
family was capable of offe ring a sizable dowry, 
and to satisfy the [indecipherable]
 family of my grandfather and 
the ma rriage took place with the 
condition that my grandfather will move from Sk
ierniewice to Lódz where her family will kind 
of see to it that they will be able to become
 economi cally viable. And they opened for him, or 

purchased for him, a grocery stor e so mewhere -- 
Staramiasta, some where in this area. Barlutai 
was farther down, Staramiasta was comi ng up. 
My grandfather was not successful as a 
businessman. 
End of Tape One, Side A 
Beginning Ta pe One, Side B 
A: He was very strong minded, and he did not appr
eciate his wife™s fa mily interference. So he 
picked up his wife and kiddies a
nd went back to Skierniewice to
 get out from under his wife™s 
parents™ thumb. 
Q: Wa it a minute, I just want to check some th
ing. Why don™t you just talk for a mo me nt here. 
Just -- 

A: Okay.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0463  
13 
 
Q: Okay. Want to just say hello? 
A: Hello. 

Q: Yeah, that™s fine. Okay. All right, so 
he leaves, and went back to the he -- 
A: And went back to Skierniewice,
 and all he could do there is pick
 up the leat her tanning in that 
haml et. And some how that didn™t wo
rk out either, economically. So -- 
Q: Is that because all the sons left? 

A: No -- 

Q: No. 

A: -- because it just -- either 
he didn™t produce good enough leathe
r commercially, he must have 
been behind his times in the product. So he cam
e back into Lódz and started a upholstery shop. 
And that™s where his boys were trained in uphol
stery business. And that™s was my father™s 
occupation or trade at the age 
of 14 when he ran away from home . He was a experienced 
upholsterer. He was hired to run 
a shop at the age of 14. That mu
st have gone on til the war 
broke out, the first World Wa r. I don™t know about th
e future wars, but in the past wars, the one I 
know of, which is the first and the second World Wa
r, the mi nute the rumor of war starts, leather 
become s gold. And as soon as the war started, ther
e was a scarcity of finished leather and my 
grandfather went back to the or
iginal leather trade which all a 
sudden became  very profitable. 
And I heard tales that he used to tan the hide
s in my grandmother™s ki
tchen, if you can imagine 
the kitchen. Well, it was illegal, 
because all this was black mark
et, what we would call it in 
modern terms. Back then it was just forbi
dden by authorities, so was -- you would buy some  
hides off a peasant and -- 

Q: Now is your dad working for him at this point
?  Does he come  -- now he™s come  back home -- 
A: No. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0463  
14 
 
Q: No. 
A: My dad came back si -- sometime in that -- 
at the end of that period, that means around 1916 - 
™17. And he joined my grand -- the -- the leathe
r trade. The dema nd for leather was so great and 
so profitable that all sudden all the sons engath
ered, and they all starte
d producing leather. And 
all of them became knowledgeable in leather 
tanning. However, my father had the greater 
expectations of hi ms elf and he single-handed ma de
 the leap from medieval to modern leather 

tanning. He taught hims elf Germa
n, and he read -- studied Ge rman biochemi stry books, because 
there are no book that relates spec
ific to tanning. Maybe
 right now there are because we live in 
specialized time s, but back then if you want a 
formal education in that particular profession, you 
had to go into it by chemistry. And the only bi
ochemi cal -- biochemi stry available was in 
German. And I still -- in th -- 
our house, my father continued try to improve his me thods, he 
continued to receive from Ger many, German te
xtbooks in biochemi stry. And he became  -- he 
made that transition from medieval to modern 
process. He became a master tanner, one of the 
best known ma ster tanners in all of Poland. 

Q: Now whe n you say mast
er tanner, is that -- 
A: All be like a boss. A ma ster tanner would 
be some body that knows the process, both ways. 
The particular chemicals that -- and the -- the pr
oportions, the mi x of chemicals applied to each 
stage, and there are ma ny stages, because you star
t off with a hairy pi ece of hide. First you got to 
get rid of the hair -- the hair, then
 you got to -- this -- 
and all si -- all this is
 done with a specific 
chemical. Some of these chemicals permeate the ti
ssues, and before the next chemical is applied, 
they had to be flushed out. So it is a complex 
knowledge, which he had to

German textbooks. 

Q: Now, when you were born in ™24 -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0463  
15 
 
A: I was born in ™24. 
Q: Your father by then is a 
ma ster tanner, or a ser -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: So by 1919, when the war ended, they -- my gr
andfather and his sons, two sons, three sons -- 
no, two sons -- my grandfather and two sons became wealthy enough from this semi  

[indecipherable] war time production of leather 
to acquire the property 
on Kwizinska 14, which 
was a factory building. And inst
alled in it modern leather tanning equipment i mported from 

Germany. 

Q: And whe n does your father get ma rried, and to whom doe s he ma rry? 

A: Oh, wait a mi nute, that was -- that was like 
in 1919, and because or iginally -- and originally 
there™s -- the plant was owned -- established 
and owned by my grandfather and my two older 
uncles, Israel and Simon. However, my rel -- 
my father™s was [indecipherable] that™s right, 
excelled in the knowledge, both my grandfather and 
his brothers, so they hired him t o become  
the ma ster tanner, in charge 
of the production. And you say -- as
ked me  before what it was -- 
mean to be a ma ster tanner, ma ster tanner 
means the -- being a -- the chemist, knowing the 
chemicals, the mi x, the application and so on. In
 addition, the ma ster tanner also has to know, 
and be able to instruct -- hired worker s who had 
no skill in that trade, how to use the mechanical 
part of it because there we re also machines th
at processed the product at different stages in 
different ways. Some  of them shaved it, because ba
sically a hide is too thick, has to be more or 
less brought down to a specific thic
kness, especially that afte
r tanning, the tissues do tend to 
swell. So if you start off with a 
raw hide, let™s say like a quarter inch 
thick, after it™s tanned, it™s 
three-quarters of an inch. We ll, you can not use a 
finished product three-qua
rter of a inch thick 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0463  
16 
 
for a upper shoe, or for a pocketbook or a belt or 
anything else. So this had to be -- the thickness 
had to be reduced by me chanical me ans, or shaved on a power ma chine. And then there was a 
machine that would soften the leather because  at 
some  stage of the process they were comi ng out 
as hard as a board, and they have to be like, fl
exible. And that was done by a machine. And then 
the final glaze was not a paint, but was applied ag
ain by heat, by a steel roller striking the face -- 
the grain of the leather that was prepared before
 with some  type of pr
eparation and that will 
produce a glaze. So it was a mechanical process, th
erefore, a ma ster tanner had not only be -- had 
to be not only knowledgeable in the chemical -- in 
the chemistry of it, but 
also in the mechanical 
in order to instruct or pass judgment on the performance of the workers. So that™s a nutshell, is a 

ma ster tanner. The ma n in charge of the enti
re production, knowledgeable in each phase. And by 
19 -- I believe ™21, my father earned enough -- 
saved enough money. My father ma rried, I 
believe in 1919, something like that, because 
my sister was born in 1921. And -- and around 

1921 - 1922, my father brought himself into the 
partnership.And moved into the factory 
complex. Up til then, while he was employed, he did not live on the premises. The premises 

there -- the apartment building with
in the compound was restricted 
to owners only. As long as he 
was not an owner, not a -- a ma tter of fact, he 
lived right on the corner, 
in an apartment on the 
corner of the mi ddle street. That will be 107 De
millaskaga. That™s where my sister was born. 
That™s the way I™m kind of trying to get the ch
ronological data because I know my sister was 
born on Demillaskaga 107 in a high -- rent ed apar tment, while I was born three years later 

already on Kwizinska on the premises of the co
mpound. And by then my father became  a partner 
to the [indecipherable] to the factory. And there 
just very few Jewish fa milies, and I reme mber 
them well. There was at 111 Yuma noskaga, whic
h is just a fe w houses down, there was some  
kind of textile product plant, again with living 
quarters, owned by a fa mily name d Friedlander. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0463  
17 
 
They were very wealthy. Must have been a very
 successful plant. Then going ho -- there was -- 
but there were no boys my age, there was a girl 
my sister™s age, a daughter, and my s i ster was 
friendly with her. Then going farther toward 
the outskirts, at about 
137 - 140 Yumanoskaga was 
another textile processing recy
cling plant, owned by a Jew name
d Osher. The reason I™m na mi ng 
these name s is because by the -- by the oddest 
quirk of fate, I came across these people many, 
many years later. I came across the name of Osher,
 Heinrich Osher in the chronicles of Lódz 
ghetto, that the -- put it in cont
ext, that there was a Heinrich
 Osher who ma rried a Gentile 
woman, and lived outside the ghetto, and that Pr
uschidsky puts together some  kind of a  story 
about it. And I knew the ma n because the head of
 the fa mily, Mr. Osher was a widower and he 
had two sons of the first ma rriage, Heinrich wa
s the youngest son of the first ma rriage, and they 
had two children, a son and a daughter after the 
second ma rriage, and the son and daughter of the 
second marriage were my age -- the son was my ag
e, and the daughter was my sister™s age. So 
that was anot her Jewish family when my sister 
already had two friends, gi
rl friends, Jewish girl 
friends. And I had at least one playma te. I would sa
y up to the age of three or four, I played with 
Gentile ki ds because Kwizinska  was an odd street
. There were only six resi dential pr operties on 
the left side. The right side was 
a big fence with a wild garden 
behind it. So you™re talking about 
six properties, ma ybe 30 - 40 Gentile fa milies, and us, the Jewish fa mily, closing off the dead 

end street. And I played with the 
Gentile kids my age til I wa s a
bout three or four. But once they 
reached the age of three or four
, five, they already became permeated with the anti-Semitism at 
home  and church and they -- I became ostracized
. They wouldn™t play w
ith me  any more. And 
from then on I was leading a pretty solitary life. I had no playma tes except when I would venture 

out to see that fellow Osher, his 
name was -- his name was Solomon. 
Q: Solomon ?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0463  
18 
 
A: Yeah, we call him Sol lik. He™s alive and kick
ing in Israel [i ndecipherable] I heard about. And 
out of necessity -- now my -- now we talking 
[indecipherabl e] we talk about my father. My 
mother, in contrast to my father was a well educ
ated person. My mother did not -- family did not 
originate fr om Lódz. They were immi grants fr om
 Ukraine. And they came fr om a little town in 
ukra -- western Ukraine name d Schwub. My moth
er was born in Lódz. The Russian and 
Ukrainian Jews were mu ch -- were not Hassidic, 
and were much more for enlightme nt education. 
Therefore my mother attended a gimnasium, whi c
h is equivalent to high school, and graduated 
from a gi mn asium. The gimnasium and the lyceum
, that™s the two additi
onal years preparative 
for college. My mother was fluent in Russian, 
both in speech and writing. My mother spoke 

accentless Polish, and wr ote perfect, correct Polish, 
while my father never ma naged Polish at all 
and spoke broken Polish. My father™s native lang
uage was Yiddish. He would navigate in Polish, 
but it definitely was not 
the gramma tical Polish.  
Q: Did your mother speak Yiddish as well? 
A: My mother no -- well, in addition to flaw
less Polish, perfect Russian, good German, not so 
much in language as in readi
ng and writing, she spoke Yiddish in 
two dialects. With my father™s 
fa mily she spoke in Lódz Yiddish. With her fa mily she spoke Litvok, Russian Yiddish. So my 
mother, out of -- I guess out of desp
eration having this kid four year
 or so old with no playma tes, 
and I must have been pretty bright for my ag
e, she taught me  how to read. And I was reading 

fluently at the age of five. And I spend my
 ti -- in Poland™s fi rst grade -- there was no 
kindergarten, first grade started at the age of 
seven, not six. So between five and seven, I spend 
my time between reading whatever was availabl
e, and using the plant,
 the factory, as my 
playground. And early on I dif -- developed an affi
nity to hang out in the machine shop. And I 
must have a inclination, inborn in
clination to work in mechani
cal things. Early on I achieved 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0463  
19 
 
dexterity in mechanical capabilit 
-- whatever mechanical. Because of all the places in the shop, 
and the -- the -- we employed about 20 some  e mpl oyees, it wa  -- wasn™t a great big factory. And 
everybody knew me because they -- 
th -- the workers, that was not
 much of a -- what would you 
say, leaving and hiring, the workers are permanent. A 
ma tter of fact, I had a picture here of a di -
- end -- entire factory group, th
e crew, with three me n that kne
w me  -- Gentile Poles that knew 
me  since day I was born. And that picture wastaken in 1946, so you can imagine there were -- 

once you got a job in a -- in that factory, in -- esp
ecially in -- in my f -- in
 a -- in a factory, in a 
place of work that was supervised by my fath
er, you were never fired. You could quit. If you 
were fired, you were fired for -- you had to be a 
real bad person to be fired. My father did not 
believe in firing people, that™s pa
rt of his Tolstoy principle. Ma
tter of fact, to [indecipherable] 
and -- and leap ahead, about 1937 I believe, the Po
lish parliame nt passed 
a law outlawing ritual 
slaughter. I don™t [indecipherabl e] but there was 
an anti-Semitic woman representative, in the 
[i ndecipherable] which is equivalent Polish to pa r
liament. She put the bill, presented a bill to the 
-- saying that the ritual slaughter
 is inhuma n. And the bill pass, a
nd all the Jewish butchers went 
out of business. And my  father on principle, ev
en though we didn™t need a
ny more help at that 
time, hired, I think four ex-butchers, because 
after all, they lost 
their livelihood, and being 
butchers, they were at least familiar and [i ndeci
pherable] hide were not odious to them. So he 
hired them. So anyway -- and th-these Gentile 
workers -- we had Jewish
 workers, too, I would 
say there was about eight or 10 Jewish employ
ees. Some  Hassidic Jews
, but [indecipherable] 
very specialized trades. And th
e rest was about 17 or so Gentiles. And I just toddled around 
between them, they all kept me  out of trouble, se
eing I don™t wind up in a pit,
 salting pit and -- or 
in the jaws of a -- a machine. 
But of all the places 
that I liked best was the machine shop. Why 
the mechanic let me  handle tools and do things and he
lp him. I really loved 
-- I had an affinity to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0463  
20 
 
mechanical things. And then by the age of seven, I was -- became  of school age and in Poland 
elementary school was compulsory education. 
However, the Poles -- the Polish authorities 
preferably had s -- did not preferably -- would no
t mi x Jews with Gentiles. So therefore, if you 
run into a survivor out of Poland who will say 
that he attended a school, elementary school or 
even a high school with Gentiles together, he -- or
 she is from a small town where there was not 
enough of a Jewish population for a segregated 
school. In Lódz, with 250,000 Jews, there was no 
problem whatsoever. Therefore, I 
was assigned to a all 
Jewish public elementary school, located 
on Ribna one-three, which is inside
 the ghetto some  of -- one of th
e streets there is Ribna Street. 
Matter of fact, on Ribna there -- 
there -- it was so much oppos -- 
in the mi ddle of the s -- of a 
center of Jewish population that 
there were really two schools, 
one a -- two buildings, separate 
buildings. One at Ribna one-three, 
and the other one was Ribna 15. E
ach one first to seven grade. 
Each one a converted, old, beat up apartment house. Th
is in spite of the fact that as you walked 
down Kwizinska and hit the inters
ection with Yuma noskaga, across th
e street, di rectly across the 
street was a brand new, beautiful, elementary 
school, built specifically for school purposes. And 
I could have attended it with a 
five mi nute walk, but that was fo
r Poles, for Gentiles only. So 
therefore I had to take a -- I lived up here, I had 
to board a trolley car and tr-travel I would say 
about 20 mi nutes on a trolley car to Ribna, which w
ould be -- this is Bals
kirinik, it™s some where 
right before Balskirinik, because it was duri
ng the war in the ghetto boundary. Well, the 
education in that school wasn™t very good, becau
se the salaries paid to the teachers were 
mi ni ma l. That was state funded 
school. And we did have in the city of Lódz, our own Jewish 
private school system. Unfortunately it was in 
town. And there was no way to send a seven year 
old one on three different trolley cars to go to sc
hool. So I spend my first two years attending the 
first grade, second grade in th
is school on Ribna, and by the age 
of 10 my mother decided I™m 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0463  
21 
 
big enough or bright enough or whatev
er, to be able to travel, take
 three different trolley cars, 
and I was signed in to a private Jewish school on
 Hermoska 48. It was a non-profit school by a -- 
operated by a s-society dedicated to spreading 
knowledge and technical capability among Jews. 
Therefore, it consisted of two separate schools. 
One wa -- was teaching first grade all the way to 
lyceum. That™s the 12
th
 year, classi c, norma l curriculum. Th
e other section was technical and had 
two departments, textile and mechanical. Well I st
art out then dar -- the separation happened on -
- was offered to the student who from -- graduating 
from sixth grade. The first -- the elementary 
school was just one type. So I attended the -- the 
third, fourth, fifth and 
sixth grade elementary 
school in that particular sc
hool on Hermoska 48. I was doing ve
ry well in school. I was class 
president for four years running, and 
put in the public school system -- 
End of Tape One, Side B

Beginning Ta pe Two, Side A 
Q: The homeroom teacher was more -- had more activity, participated mo
re with the st udent 
body than the homeroom teacher in the United Stat
es the way I know it, and I do know what the 
home room t eacher in the United States does be
cause my youngest daughter is a schoolteacher. 

The homeroom teacher will be assigned this pa
rticular homeroom, a group of students, and you 
would follow them all the way. That means if y
ou acquired a homeroom teacher, let™s say in the 

first year of high school, you had him til you gr
aduated. And he knew you thoroughly. And he 
dealt with the student body through the class president. So my  function was not just a title, but 

there was a specific activity. I was the go-betw
een. The way the chain of command went, if a 
visiting teacher let™s sa
y, ma th, geography, whatever, had a 
problem with a student, he would 
first try to deal himself, or herself with th
e student. Didn™t get anywhere he™d turn to the 

homeroom t eacher. The homeroom t eacher would turn
 to the class pr esident and say what are we 
going to do about this kid?  And again the oddest 
quirk of fate, my home room teacher in high 
school was a ma n na me d Nahoum Bl umenthal. And 
Nahoum Blumenthal is of [indecipherable] 

and Yad Vashem e mployment. I came across some
 monographs and some ar -- articles and I 

think couple books published by Yad Vashem with 
a Nahoum Blumenthal byline. Isn™t that the 
oddest thing in the world?  And I know it™s him becau
se we ha d terrific relationship the two of us 
for the two years running before 
the war, ™38 - ™39, and then he 
disappeared during the war. In 
1945 sometime early summer I™m walking on Piotkowsk
a, principle street, and I™m running into 
Professor Blumenthal, my teacher. And we stoppe
d and we chatted and we reme mbered the old 
times when I was the pupil and he wa s the teacher
, and I asked him what he is doing and he said 
he just arrived from unit -- from the Soviet 
Union where he survived the war, and he was 
working for the Jewish Histori
cal Society, and the Jewish Hist
orical Society was transferred 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0463  
23 
 
fairly recently to Lódz and he is -- he  just 
arrived in Lódz and he™s working for the Jewish 
Historical Society. So I pretty
 sure that anything appeari
ng with the name of Nahoum 
Blumenthal out of Yad Vashem wo
uld be the same individual because
 eventually I imagine as -- 
I -- I don™t think he stayed 
any longer than 1956 in Poland, because 1956 was when Gomoka 
opened up a -- the borders for the 
Jews , and a lot of Jews left. 
Q: Okay. I™m going to suggest that we
 try to move closer to the -- 
A: Okay, let™s -- 
Q: -- to the war, only 
because of the time -- 
A: Oh, okay. 

Q: -- at this -- at
 this mo me nt.  
A: The war -- 

Q: So, the war. 

A: -- the war. The war is at -- the war is -- how
 the war started. Because I kept no diary -- 
Q: Did you think about keeping a diary? 

A: Pardon?  

Q: Did you think about it? 

A: No. 

Q: You didn™t? 

A: No. Because -- because I kept no diary, why th
e events are very strong in my mi nd. As you 
see that my -- I got a memory like an elephant . 
I wish I wouldn™t. I -- 
I with to God that I 
wouldn™t. I mean things are -- when I -- I -- I -- 
I-I -- I can see pi -- pictures in my mi nd like a 
film running. I spoke today -- this morning at brea
kfast, I spoke with my fr iend in Silver Spring, 
and I say to him, Henry, do you reme mber I -- no, 
said to him,  ﬁHenry, I finally pinpointed the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0463  
24 
 
exact day of the -- the d -- exact 
date of the day of interegnam, when we spent the day together 
with the city laying dead in fr
ont of us.ﬂ He says, ﬁI don™t re
me mber.ﬂ And I say to him -- and 
because -- and I cou -- I did prep
are myself for this interview because of the chronological 
problems of events. I don™t want
 to confuse it. According to
 the Pruschidsky, that™s the 
chronicles, the Polish army pulled out Sept
ember sixth, evacuated. The Germans entered 
September eighth. Now that gives me  the date that I spent with Henry. I spent with He nry the 
day of the seventh of September. He lived on 
Piotkowska 20, which is center of the city, and I 
lived on the outskirts. I reme mber it like now, wa
s a beautiful, sunny day, cloudless. And the city 
was dead. No vehicular traffic, no trolley cars 
running, hardly any people 
in the streets. And I 
made my wa y all the way from my home, 
all the way down [i ndecipherable] down, down 
[indecipherable] up to Piotkowska 20, and I went
 up and we spend day together, went on the 
streets, we walked the st reets, and I didn™t ge
t home til about five o™clock, and my mother 
thought that I already am gone permanently becau
se there was a drive to move eastward. And 
she thought that I me t some  -- with some  fellows
 in town and we decided to go before the 
Germans enter. So that™s how the war started. Th
ere were rumors before the war about the -- the 
probability. I reme mber pikou -- I was always a 
voracious reader even though I did develop a 
social life, my primary entertainment and preo
ccupation was reading. I reme mber some ti me  in 
the summer of ™39, I came  across a book calle
d, ﬁThe Brown Book,ﬂ which described the 
atroci ties committed by the germa -- by the Nazis on the German Jews. Dachau concentration 

camp. With pictures. And I reme mbe r  taking th
e book down the factory yard where my father 
was kind of circulating, a
nd stopping my father in his work 
and saying, ﬁDad, take a look what I 
just picked up at the library.ﬂ
 And I sh -- opened it up and showed him the  pictures and some  

captions, how the Jews ar e being ma ltreat --  Ge
rman Jews ar e being ma ltreated by the Nazis. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0463  
25 
 
And I say, ﬁDad, what™s going to happen when 
the Germans will arrive? When the war star ts, 
then Germans will come here.ﬂ And my father™s
 answer was typical of the [i ndecipherable] 
generations. ﬁ Well,ﬂ he said, ﬁI
 dealt with the Germans in 191
7 - ™18. You can do business with 
the Germans.ﬂ Very significant.  

Q: Tell me  about this book a little bit. Do you have any -- 

A: I have no idea -- 

Q: You don™t -- 

A: It was -- the title was ﬁThe Brown Book,ﬂ had a brown cover -- 

Q: Published in Germany you think? 

A: No, pu -- published in Polish. 

Q: Oh -- mm-hm. 

A: Could be a translation, pretty thick. 

Q: And wha t  year did you read that? 
A: And profusely -- 
Q: It was ™37? 

A: -- illustrated. It must have been published at
 least around ™37 - ™38, for me  to read it in Polish 
in ™39. 

Q: So you read it in ™39? 

A: Right. 

Q: Uh-huh. Had you known about Kristallnacht? 

A: Oh yes. 

Q: And whe r e did you read about that? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0463  
26 
 
A: In newspapers. Radio, newspapers. The Poles 
were quite eager and exuberant, if you can use 
that term exuberant to announce 
publicly these news, how the Jews are being beaten up and -- 
because it gave them a more or less a moral excuse
 to mi streat the Polish Jews. After all, if the 
western, the civilized world, which goes to Po
land, wa -- German, it was the western world. 
Q: What did yo -- did your father
 respond to that differently, or 
your mother?  That you™re not -- 
A: I don™t -- I don™t think I discus
sed it with my mother. And that™s where my father was wrong. 
How -- now once the war broke out, again I got to 
use some body else™s dates. After the Germans 
entered, the restrictive measures
 were announced against the Jews
 virtually imme diately. And I 
have a date, September -- beginning September 18
th
, til -- til December 18
th
, there was a whole 
row, one after another of orders restricting Jews, beginning with curfew, not permitting Jews to 
use principle streets to -- to walk on. 

Q: And how would you -- 

A: The Jews had to use side streets. 
Q: And how was using -- 
A: Piotkowska was out of bounds for  Jews. Matt
er of fact, Henry™s house, which was facing 
Piotkowska [indecipherable] they 
had to break through the back wa
ll, so there would be back 
entrance from a street parallel 
to Piotkowska. And then there 
was a ordinance about the Jews 
being identified first by yellow bands. 

Q: Yellow bands? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Around the arm?  

A: Ar mbands. 

Q: Ar mbands. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0463  
27 
 
A: The star came right after. The armband I woul
d say was on for about two or three months and 
then the order was changed to a Star of Davidthey wore on -- on the chest and the back. You 
know, you had to have it 
on a -- your shoulder too. 
Q: How did you find out?  How 
were the ordinances -- 
A: Oh they were printed in a form of a large pos
ter. And there were special pre -- before the war 
they were like round structures, I™
ll say eight, 10 foot diameter by 
about 12 foot tall, ma de out of 
concrete, specifically for poste
rs. And movie houses, movie theaters, whatever, was -- wer -- 
anybody was free to put a poster up. And -- 

Q: Do you reme mber seeing these?  
You reme mber seeing these posters? 

A: The -- restricting the Jews?  
Oh sure. Wa s -- you just -- you 
went on the street and you stopped 
at this poster display and you r
ead the -- the la
test poster. 
Q: What was going through your head at this time?  

A: To tell you the truth, I was preocc
upied. First of all, I was in love. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: I was going steady with a girl, so war or no wa
r, and ma ybe I was reckless, or I didn™t realize 
what I™m getting into it, but all 
these ordinance I took -- 
I™ll say -- I say okay, 
I can live with that. 
I mean, the curfew, I can live with
 that, I can adjust my lifestyle. Armband, I can live with that. 
Old -- 

Q: You are 15? 

A: Yeah. Well, 14 going on 15. It don™t stop me  fr
om dating my girl and dating -- and taking her 
to the movies, even though the movies already 
in the center city, the 
first run movies, were 
forbidden to the Jews. But ther e were a lot of sm
all movie theaters, because movie thea -- movies 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0463  
28 
 
was the only entertainment available to general p
ublic. So mo vies were very popular, there was a 
-- a sl ew of movie theater
s, third, fourth run. 
Q: And these are western movies as well as movies from --  

A: Western, they were mo
stly western movies -- 
Q: Mostly western. 

A: -- yeah, there were hardly any movies ma de in
 Poland. Also -- all -- oh, I reme mber the first 
movies I saw was Tom Mix, Ken 
Maynard, Elme r Lincoln. The firs
t Tarzan was Elmer Lincoln. 
I reme mber him right now. He had a beard. Imagine Tarzan with a beard. 

Q: And these are transl ated, are these captione d?  

A: Oh well, they had the captions, right. So I reme mb
er just taking these ordi
nances part of that™s 
the way it is. 

Q: So you forgot the book in some  [indecipherable] 

A: We ll, I didn™t forget the book,but I didn™t relate to
 it because now -- now we™ve gone into the 
specifics. What happened with business, because even though I was only 14, I was raised on the 

factory compound. 

Q: Wait a minute, let me -- let me stop this for a mi nute. I just  want to -- 

A: So it wasn™t like my father would go off 
some where to nowhere, leave the apartment or 

whatever and come  back in the evening. 
Business and residence were always -- 
Q: Together? 

A: -- together . My mother -- my mother participat
e in the -- in the business. A matter of fact, my 
mother participate very strongly because she wa
s the only woma n in the whole bunch that spoke 
flawless Polish. And the relations
hi p between the Polish author itie
s, whether tax authority or 
whatever, and the Jews were, at the best, adve
rsary. And if a Jew came 
with some  kind of a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0463  
29 
 
problem to be corrected into a state run office,
 if he spoke with an accent ed Polish, he was 
ridiculed, he was disregarded, he wasn™t even gi
ven the proper attenti
on.So my mother was -- 
any time there was a problem with any kind of st
ate office, and the operation of the factory, my 
mother was delegated to go down and deal w
ith the bureaucrats because her Polish wa s a 
flawless Polish. So -- now, therefore, I was pres
ent -- not I took any kind 
of active part in the 
business, but I was present and s -- I was -- I 
had the knowledge of the business subliminally, 
virtually by osmosis. And I knew that the busines s in the preceding months before the war was 
very, very dead, was virtually at 
standstill. There was no trade going on. 
Q: [interruption] Okay. 

A: Things were bad, and right after the Germans 
entered, all sudden things 
picked up. First of all 
there was a steady stream of 
unifor m, green unifor m Ger ma ns. I don™t know their rank. They 
definitely were not privates, comi ng in and buying
 leather, in all kind of
 quantities, til they 
reached a point where the partners, my father
 and his brothe rs were limiting the quantities 
because when a German or two German uniforme d would come  in and say they want to buy 

skins, finished skins, leather, they would be offe
red two, or three, or four skins, with the usual 
explanation and I was witnessing 
it, you are not a me rchant si
r, you want for some  kind of 
private use, is two good enough, or w
ould you like three?  And apparently they had all the cash in 
the world. 

Q: So they paid? 

A: Oh yes. They were polite, they we re well behaved, they we re -- they we re not Volksdeutschen 

they were Reichsdeut schen. They were -- I believe
 they were, because of their green uniforms, 
they were regular We hrmacht. The regular We hrm
acht were just decent, ordinary Germans, they 
were not Nazis. Cause the [indeci
pherable] Nazis would be black uni
forms, either SS --  well, SS. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0463  
30 
 
Whatever. They were Wehrmacht. And they came with -- money was no problem and all of a 
sudden business was booming. And there was this
 stream of Germans comi ng in, and I became 
inured to the fact that the German in a green
 uniform is in a way, harmless. Can you see that 
complacency? 

Q: So you didn™t -- you did 
not think about danger. 
A: Right, cause I realized that we Jews are 
like a home less dog, outside the law. Now no laws 
applied. I was at one time, some ti me I would sa
y in end of September, some  Ger mans came  to 

the house, into the plant on a 
weekend when the factory was 
shut down. And they knocked on 
the apartment doors. And they wore civi -- civi
lian clothes but wore Nazi armbands, with the 
swastika. And they were looking for young me n. And they grab me  and escorted me , took me  

down to a nearby high school complex, and I was ma de -- German refugees from the eastern 

territories were arriving into L
ódz because under the Soviet German
 pact, any German that lived 
wa -- east of Bug river, in the Russian occupi
ed territory was free to leave with as much 
belonging as he wanted to. And ma ny of thes
e Germans fled. And they arrived, among other 
cities, they arrived in 
Lódz. And that™s where the problem star
ted for the Jews, in the center of 
the city because all a sudden, end of September,
 October, there are hundreds of Ger man fa milies 
arrivi ng in Lódz, tryi ng -- and the German authoriti
es desperate to try to find a place for them to 
live, so the logical answer for them was thro
w the Jews out of their housing, and offer the 
housing to the refugee Germans. But they woul
dn™t go into Baloote, because the housing in 
Baloote was no running water, no 
indoor plumbing. So these Jews 
in Baloote, the poor Jews, 
they were left alone. And it wa
s the upper scale Jews, occupying 
the new sections and the new 
areas that had running water, that
 had indoor plumbing, that were th
e first ones to suffer of being 
tossed out su-summa rily out of their apartments. 
So I was taken down to that relocation center. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0463  
31 
 
Germans we re arriving and I -- th
ere was a -- there wa
s a group of Jews, young Jews, dragged in 
from God knows where. I didn™t know anybody. And th
 -- we™re told to -- 
they were arriving by 
trolley cars, apparently from the 
train station. And we were told to help them. So I carried the 
suitcases and bags from the side
walk into the interior of the 
school, was [indecipherable] it was 
gym or something. And work for 
about two or three hours and then
 there was a break and -- in 
the transports, and I was invited to whatever I --
 ask would want some  refreshment. Just like the 
refugee -- refugees. There were 
the coffee urns, or whatever, a
nd go ahead and have a sandwich, 
and so. But on the other hand, one day I was walk
ing the street, I was grabbed by a German who 
had no identity -- no identification at all. I 
don™t know even know whether he was a German. But 
he say, hey you there, grabbed me  out -- by the arm 
and he said, ﬁI need you.ﬂ And he drive me  
to his house and ma de me move some furniture
 for him. I me an, we were like a homeless dog. 
But that still didn™t stop me from -- 

Q: From moving around. 
A: -- from moving around because these -- these th
ings done to me , were not like an organized 
systematic, but we knew that we Jews can be trea
ted anyway an individual German wants to treat 
us, but basically I was treated fa
irly decently. I was never abused, 
let™s put it this way, even when 
they grabbed me  for some thing. And this brings 
me  to a very interesting point. That -- because 
that was the last time when I was permitted to 
travel the streets. From then on I became a 
prisoner in the compound. According to, 
again the Pruschidsky, on November 11
th
, the Germans 
destroyed the statue of Ko
˚
ciuszko that was placed on Plac Wolno
˚
ci in the center of the city. 
Q: That™s Freedom Squa re, right? 
A: Freedom Square, right. It was a horse mounted Ko
˚
ciuszko -- I think th
e horse was on two 
legs, two hind legs and Ko
˚
ciuszko the big saver, and this -- th
is -- the horse and the rider were 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0463  
32 
 
on top of a pedestal, like a -- I 
would say octagonal. A very larg
e one, possibly 30 feet diameter. 
It was a very ma ssive pedestal
. [indecipherable] support, but -- 
and each panel of the oc -- 
octagon depicted different feats in life of Ko
˚
ciuszko. And apparently 
this was ma de out of 
bronze, were bronze relief panels. And that was 
my -- ah, no -- so once I 
read this, the whole 
event came to my mi nd. I had a date, and 
I went with my date to the movies. 
Q: This is the girlfriend, th
is is the same  girlfriend? 
A: Right, same  girlfriend. 
Q: What™s her name? 

A: I was going steady. He r name  was Rainya -- my God, just told Henry. 

Q: Well, it™ll come back. 

A: I met her in ™38. So I met her and we went to the movies, I reme mber the name of t he movie 

theater, Bika, which me a ns fairy tale.  

Q: What does it mean? 
A: Fairy tale. 
Q: Fairy tale. 

A: Yeah, Bika in Polish is fair
y tale. And we went to the movi
es, we saw the pictur e. It was 
some where on the outskirts, and mu st have been shortly before the curfew and I didn™t take her 

home . We  parted compa ny one point, she went
 up, and I went up, and I tell you my way down 
again Nowomi ejska, was Skerska and some where before I even hit Skerska, which is an 

extension of Nowomi ejska, I get stopped by a 
uniformed German patrol. And they bring my 
back to Pazelnofscha and I see a 
group of people working at the Ko
˚
ciuszko statue. And I™m 
being ordered to take my overcoat off, this was 
November, pretty cold, pu
t a pile of overcoats 
and join the workers. So I joined the workers, 
and there were some with
 [indecipherable] tools, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0463  
33 
 
chisels, sledge hammers, were banging away a
nd trying to separate th
ese bronze panels away 
from the concrete. And I worked til about two a.
m. At two a.m., I guess the Germans got tired -- 
and they were decent enough, there was a non-com 
-- it was a military unit, and it was a non-com 
in charge, and he said, ﬁOkay Jews, go home , that
™s the end, the end of the day.ﬂ And we said, 
ﬁHow we going to go home , it™s a curfew and we
 will get arrested on the way home.ﬂ And he 
was nice enough to get ahold of a bunch of slips 
and s -- write some thing in German and hand 
out to each one of us. Here, here. You show
 it -- anybody stops you, you show it to him, you™ll 
be all right. So I went home and that was the 
endof my -- my parents 
withdrew permission for 
me  to leave the factory compound fr om then on, that™s November 11
th
, I was virtually 
imprisoned. 
End of Tape Two, Side A 
Beginning Ta pe Two, Side B 
A: You can imagine the [indecipherable], and -- and 
there was also already talk, gossi p, that the 
Jewish businesses are going to be confiscated. So
 my father was looking for a tame  or captive 

German to kind of be the front ma n. 

Q: What wo rd -- 

A: Be a front ma n. 

Q: Yeah, I know, but what word did you use? 

A: Captive, na -- tame. 

Q: A tame ?  

A: Yeah, a tame  Germa n, yeah. 

Q: Oh, a tame  Ger man, I see. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0463  
34 
 
A: Tame , ye  -- captive, yeah. And -- and agai
n, an odd coincidence that in 19 -- between 1935 
and 1938, my father did not work wi
th his partners at this locati
on, but around a ta
nnery, in a -- a 
rented tannery in Erda Pa rbenietska, wh
ich is oh, some where in this direction. 
Q: North. North of -- 
A: I -- yeah, there was Parbieni etsa and there was Erda Parbenietska, two separate townships 

adjoining Lódz, with [indecipherable] running [ind
ecipherable] platzi -- th
is was Platzia Monta. 
It™s not ma rked, but this junction 
is called -- was called Platzia Mont
a. It was Platzia Monta, Plaz 
Baranik, Plaz Bowtski. At these two junctions th
e city -- there were two separate trolley car 
companies. One was inner city, had their own tr
olley cars, their own co
lors, and there was the 
suburban, which had their own trolley cars, different
 shape, different size, and different color. 
And they were running out of [indecipherable] Pl
atzia Monta outwards. These were the junction 
points where you transferred.  

Q: Right. 
A: So my fa ther worked in a rented tannery. 
And that tannery belonge
d to a German, wealthy 
German fa mily, well known in Lódz, name d Ra
nka. And one of their in-law, na me d Rudolf 
Stribel, he wa s kind of appointed 
to run that tannery some  time in 
the 30™s, I -- early 30™s and he 
was not a tanner, he was a bookkeeper [indeci
pherable] bookkeeper, he wa s a bookkeeper. And 
he ran the tannery down the ground, and his in-l
aws shut it down. And it was vacant and my 
father teame d up with another me rchant, and th
ey rented the tannery, 
and started producing. 
Q: So he -- so he™s not running tw
o tanneries, now, he™s closed down -- 

A: No, he lets his brothers -- no, no, he left -- 

Q: I see. 

A: -- he stepped out of the -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0463  
35 
 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: That was -- there were differe
nces, serious differences between 
my father and his brothers and 
in 1935 he reached a point where he just chuc ked it. 

Q: But you™re still living in the compound? 

A: But we -- yes, right, while he was not par
ticipating any more either in the production or the 

proceeds of the plant, we were 
still owners to the property and 
therefore we still occupied our 
apartment. So when they rented that tannery Erda
 Parbenietska, this fellow
, str -- Rudolf Stribel, 
came around a-and introduced hims elf that he is th
e son-in-law of the owners of the property and 
he™s a bookkeeper, and would we -- would my fath
er need a bookkeeper?  And my father and his 
partner said yes. Especi
ally that he was skilled in that pa
rticular kind of bookkeeping because he 
was doing the bookkeeping for the previous operators 
of the tannery. So they hired him, and he 
worked for them for -- between ™35 and ™38. In 
™38 they quit that, gave up [indecipherable] ran 
out and they came back, both my father and his th
en partner, to the Kwizinska. Actually, what 
happened is that partner 
of my father bought oneof my uncles 
out, and my grandfather. So there 
was a change in the ma ke-up of partners. So at 
that point  when some  of the Germans that were 
comi ng in were kind of not nice, and there wa s rumors of being -- Je
wish properties being 
confiscated, my parents -- well, the adults st arted looking for solutions, and one solution that 

became i mmediately apparent was get hold of Stri
bel and find out what he is doing. And they -- 
they found him, and there he is I would say 
two months into the German occupation, still 
walking next to his shoes. Apparently he did not
 benefit in the fi rst ei
ght weeks from being a 
superior German.  

Q: What do you mean he was walking -- 

A: Next to his shoes. With holes in his soles. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0463  
36 
 
Q: I see. 
A: He was still pretty poor shap
e. Couldn™t latch on anything, and at
 that point they offered him a 
job, that first of all he would be a front ma n. He
 will deal with the Germans. And he accepted it 
eagerly, anything, hey. And it was a -- going with mi xe
d results because he really had no official 
standing, so some  -- while most of the Germans 
would kind of act more s -- in a mor e  subdued 
ma nner whe n they would deal with him, others
 were bolder enough to say, who are you and what 
are you doing, what are you, a Jewish servant? And 
it would even ma ke the situation worse. So it 
was a mi xed blessing, but it -- it 
worked to some  extent, and business was good. I me a n, money 
was rolling in like crazy. And then all a sudde
n some  time again, I would say by November, the 

Germans established, confiscated officially -- th
ere was a decree out of Berlin confiscating all 
Jewish property and establishi
ng a special office to handle Je
wish property. And admi nister 
Jewish property. It was called in German, De tr
euhand stellech. Treuhand means an honest hand, 
treu honest hand. And the admi nistrators were na
me d Treuhande. So the adults, the partners got 
on Stribel, and say hey Stribel, you better go down to
 Posum - -  Posun, I -- which was the seat of 
the -- by then naturally, Lódz was incorporat
ed into Bartigo and we became  thoroughly 

Germanized, all the vestiges of pole -- Polish 
[indecipherable] were gone. We became  a German 
city in Germany.  

Q: [inaudible] 

A: Bartigo, with Posun becomi ng the capital of th
e province. So we kind 
of -- the adults said, 
hey Stribel, you better go down to Posun and apply 
for the job of treuhande for this factory. And 
he kind of hemmed and hawed. I don™t -- I don™
t know why he was timid about it. I -- I 
reme mber it because I was partic -- I wasn™t part
icipating, but I was present to the conversations. 

The space wa s limited. The office was the office, big d
eal. But he went off. He went off, he came 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0463  
37 
 
back I think two or th
ree days beaming, with official pa
pers, nami ng hi m t hat admi nistra -- 
official administrator of the fact
ory. At that point they sat down 
the partners with him and they 
wrote a private agreement where he recognize the cu
rrent owners as the tr
ue owners and he will 
only act as their representative, while represen
ting the German office. And he recognizes the 
right of the owners to participate in profits. It
 was like a private arrangeme nt. At the same  ti me , 
while this was going on and Stribe
l™s presence became kind of more
 official standing, he could 
deal better with the -- 
whoever arrived to purchase the leat
her, and the Jews kept in the 
background. Being in Bartigo -- lo
cated in Bartigo, in a German 
city, because all vestiges of 
Polish rule disappeared. The cit -- there was 
the Polish police disappe
ared. The shupari a-
appeared, they were imported. Shup is the [indeci
pherable] the law and or
der, all the German 
institutions, and then we had -- at same  ti me  
wer e  -- became aware that not all of occupied 
Poland was incorporated, that the Germans ju
st took the western part and formed three 
provinces, us being the center one, Bartigo.However, the eastern pa
rt is called general 
governme nt, and there is -- the Polish rule prevails
, the Polish police, natio
nal police is still in 
charge in their navy blue uniforms. Polish sc
hools are being active.
 Polish language is -- 
language is the official language. So all things be
 equal, we assume d that between -- that the 
Jewish fate in the hands of the Germans is going to
 be much worse in area incorpor ated directly 
into Germany, than in -- into area that is onl
y temporarily occupied by the Germans for the 
duration of the war, with its 
fate decided after the war. 
Q: Now how did you find out about what 
was going on in the general governme nt? 
A: There was travel going on, back and forth. We ll, 
there was also i -- let™s 
-- let™s say that there 
was actually a four -- there was an
 exodus of Jews out of Lódz at
 least three -- th
ree time s. The 
first exodus was imme di ately following the Polish
 army as it evacuated. A lot of Jews left, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0463  
38 
 
especially Jews with -- who were Communists or Communist followers. And -- because they -- 
we already heard that the Russians are comi ng in 
from the other side, and the first wave of the 
Jews that left Lódz, the young me n especiall
y, kept on going. And went all the way across the 
Bug river to the Russians, to the Reds. And the ot
her part of the wave, the mi ddle edge, were the 
ones that were cash liquid -- had liquidity and 
they left hoping that the Germans weren™t 
[i ndecipherable] the Poles will at  one point resist . 
So that the fi rst wave. That ri ght away reduced 
the po -- Jewish population of Lódz. And then 
there was the second wave, when Lódz was 
incorporated into Third Reich, and we became awar
e that ea stern occupi ed territories are gene ral 
governme nt, so that was a second wave of e migra
tion of Jews out of Lódz. Again, the ones that 
were cash liquid. You had to have liquidity to 
leave. So while we™re si tting in the tannery, 
making hands over fist, we considered -- I™m talking 
about adults -- that th
e state is going to be 
temporary, and very temporary. That very soon we
™ll have to move on and being of a kind of a 
mi nd that looks ahead and doesn™t wait for things 
to happen, just like the way we hired that 
German before we had to, we started looking for 
alternatives. It so happened that my mother™s 
brother, who was operating a very successful es
tablishment on the corner
 of [indecipherable] 
Nowomi ejska. He had like a sweet shop, lunchroom,
 whatever, but very successful. He -- and he 
was able to pull out a lot of cash from the ba
nks before the Jewish accounts were frozen. I 
reme mber him boasting, showing -- opening up a 
shoebox full with currency, high domi na -- 
denomination currency, telling to -- telling my
 mother in my presence, ﬁDon™t worry about 
money, because in this box there™s enough for both 
our fami lies to survive the war.ﬂ They were 

childless. 

Q: They were what? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0463  
39 
 
A: They were childless. He was a younger brothe
r, my mother™s younger brother and they were 
childless. So the adults some how organize
d, I don™t know -- I don™t reme mber how, but 
organized an apartment, some  housi ng in a to
wn called Tomashuv Mazovyetski. And that was 
already rented through emissaries. And it was sop 
-- the component that™s supposed to eventually 
occupy these premises rented in that town Toma
shuv Mazovyetski was my mother™s brother with 
his wife, a childless couple, my parents with their 
children, that means my 
sister andme . And my  
Uncle Simo n with his wi fe and again, son 
and a daughter. The son was born in 1910, was 14 
years older than I, he was already a -- part 
time into medical studies in Belgium. And his 
daughter was my -- about old as my sister. Not very
 much older. So that was the component that 
was going to go to m -- settle in Tomashuv Mazovye
tski when things come  to an end at the 
tannery. But some how they didn™t want to come
 to an end. The money was good and was still 
fairly safe haven. However, my uncle, the one th
at -- my mother™s side, he was [indecipherable] 
at loose ends. He lost his business. So the decisi
on was that part of the component will go off to 
Toma shuv, the ones that are not n
ecessary. Thatmeans my fa ther 
and mother will stay on, my 
Uncle Simo n and his wife will stay on, and ever
ybody, the youngsters, my sister and I in early 
teens and my cousins in their late teens or
 early 20™s will leave for Tomashuv under the 
supervision of the two adults. 

Q: Now, which two adults then? 

A: My father™s -- my mo ther™s brother and his wife  -- 

Q: Wi fe. 

A: -- that childless couple. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0463  
40 
 
A: And there was already a truck hired, and I re
me mber an afternoon some  ti me  in Nove mber, 
possibly mi d-November  or so, the truck was in th
e factory yard and the -- they [indecipherable] 
after the work stopped, being loaded with basic 
furniture, bedsteads, ma ttresses, and -- and 
bedding and all our spare clothing, wi
nter clothing, I mean you name  it.
 Just bare necessities left 
behind because everybody™s already going and the onl
y ones that are staying 
just for another few 
weeks, is my father and my mother, and my 
Unc l e Simon and his wife, for as long as the 
business is good and can be milked. And once the 
truck got all loaded up 
with all the goods and 
now ca me  the turn for the -- for humans to ge
t loaded up and first my cousins hopped on, and 
then my sister went up on the tailgate, and she 
was in, and I was the last one. There is my uncle 
and my aunt  standing, and my mo
ther and my father, and naturally Uncle Simon and his wife. 
And I™m the last one to get on the truck, the tailg
ate, and my Aunt Ida turns to my mo ther and 
says, ﬁHim I don™t take. He™s too nasty and he™s 
too fussy, I don™t want him.
 I™ll take Mary, but I 
won™t take him. I won™t put up with hi
m.ﬂ And t he truck went off without me . 
Q: She hadn™t said this before, how you -- 

A: No. We ll, I was -- 

Q: Did anybody argue -- 

A: -- maybe that -- pardon? 

Q: -- did -- did anybody argue? 

A: There -- there was no point of
 arguing. I mean, she was a superv
ising adult, if she turned her 
thumbs down on me , that™s it. And besides, it wasn™t
 that critical, because 
after all, the bulk of 
the people went, and the bulk of the goods, it was the goods that
 -- and the leftover to follow 

would be only lightly encumbered, because all the stuff went. 

Q: Now there™s no problem about
 going, apparently, right?  They
™re not -- they™re not stopped? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0463  
41 
 
A: Apparently no -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- and they arrived safe  in Toma shuv, and it turn
ed out that things in Toma shuv were terrible. 
The housing, the food, or whatever, the -- both th
e Gentile and the Jewish native population was 
resentful of the newcome r s, and now I stayed 
behind. I was happy. I didn™t want to go. I -- that 
was ma  -- my playground, there is the plant, my 
factory and I was happy to 
stay behind. And that 
was sometime in de -- late December, or begi nni
ng of January. I was standing in the factory yard 
as usual during the day, and my father was standi
ng in factory yard in 
the snow. And the gate 
opens up and my sister bursts thro
ugh the gate and grabs my  father by his neck and starts kissing 
him, saying ﬁTatish, Tatish, I love you.ﬂ And be
hind her come s my cousin Manasha. And that™s 
it, just two of them. And we star
t asking what™s what, and Manasha,
 who was older, he was in his 
20™s already, he explained that 
things were unbearable at Toma
shuv, there was a lot of friction 
among the -- the family itself, and friction with 
the neighbors, both Jews and Gentiles, with the 
indigenous neighbors and the newcomers. And fi
nally Manasha -- Manasha took sick and there 
was no doctor up there and when he got well he d
ecided to go back home . And my sister Mary 
decided to go with him;  not his sister. And 
they ma de their way back, I would say about -- 

through the winter snows, at least 130 - 150 mile
