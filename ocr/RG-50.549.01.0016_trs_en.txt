Q :  You m ent io ned  t ha t yo u u s ed  a  who l e,  you  h ad  be en  gi ve n a se r i es of  n am e s an d 
you'dalsosaid that youdidn't remem ber them all. Sincethe interview,have you 
r em em b ered  m o r e of  t hem ?
 

A : W el l , I do n 't  rem em ber  wh i c h 
ones I did remem ber at the tim e.  But, one of them 
was Anny, as a matter of  fact, and that why it was so striking to see that book.  One 

of  them wa s Sha l ot ( ph) D on ra e (p h ), I th in k at  s om ep o int I m u st ha ve ha d a nam e 

Marie, youknow, tom akeme as Catholic
 
a s po s s ible.  T ha t ' s ab ou t a ll  I  r em em be r, 
soIdon't know if thoseare the onesIsaid, butat least thosethree I remem ber.
 
Q: So you started out life as Anna?
 
A:W ell, I actually started life as Hannala(ph), which is, m y parents were both f rom 

P o la nd a
nd they spokeYiddishand Polishandcertainly only gavemethe name, let's 

s a y,  Anna be cau s e t he y had to ha ve some of f ic i a l s ound in g E u rop ean , I m ean 

W esternEuropeanname. But,m y Hebrew name was Hannah and, or is still Hannah, 

H a nna h ____ __ ___ _, a s a m a tt e r of f ac t , an d tha t wa s m y m ate rna l gr a n dm othe r ' s 

name.  Until,m y mom  diedaboutsix monthsago, and she used tocallme Hannala 

still. So,that's how I startedout. Andthenas a kid,as I went throughthe war, I 
guess they made itfrom  Anna, Anny 
b ec au se th at  sou nd ed m o re F re nc h wh e n we 
got into France. And then with all the variouspapers thatm yparents got,mostlym y 
mother, I was with hermostof thetim e,they cam e, the nam e came withthepapers.  

So if it was Marie, well,I was told, you know, you arenow Marie, if  it was Renee(ph), 

youare Renee, if it's Charlotte, I think the last one was Charlotte, Charlotte Henri(ph), 

that was the one before.  And a very funny thing happened after the war, when m y 

f at he r  cam e  b ac k  f r om  con c en t rat i on  c am p a nd  m y m ot he r wan te d h im  to  meet  t he 

people who had, they weren'tofficially hidingus because we werepaying rentthere 

supposedly,butat least we were living there underfalsepretensesandI think they 

k ne w t hat  we we r en 'te xa c t l y who we  sa id we  we r e. 
 
My mother wanted to meet those 
p eop l e and the y,  s o h er n am e wa s , I  can 't r em em b e r wh at he r n am e wa s , T on r ee ( ph ) 

wa s  th e last nam e, wh i c h i sa  ve r y F ren ch nam e, an dt he y ca l le dh im  Mon s ie ur 

Tonree when theyf irstsaw him , which was very f unny. T hey never 
got used to the 

idea that we, actually even our nam es were not our names.  And so that's the story 
of  th e nam e .
 
Q :  Ho w did  you  go a bou t un l ea rn i n g on e nam e an d lea rn i n gan ot her on e?
 
A :W e l l, it wa s ve r yd if f ic u l t.  It wa s  ve r yd if f i cult . It wa s , I wa s ve r
y, ve r y f r i ghte ne d 
most ofthe time, I meanI wasliving in terror and I was soafraidthatI wouldm ix it 
up, youknow, that I would just say, whatever the name was, was wrong, youknow? 

S o I 'd  ju st t r y t o co nc ent r at e,  you  kno w,  an d kee p te l l in gm ys e lf ,  
you are now such

such. ButI was very f rightened, Imean there wasn't, it wasn't hard in the sense 
of, you know, these are names I could pronounceandI learned French very quickly, 

but it was very hardemotionally.Tonot knowfrom one day tothe ne
xt wh o yo u we r e 

s up po sedt ob ean d m a ke s u re yo u rem em ber  the r igh t, yo u kno w,  the r i gh t p e rs on 
to be that particular time.
 

Q:W ere youever afraidthat you wouldforgetyour real nam e?
 
A: I don't think I was thinking about that very much.  I mean, the only concerns I had 
was to survive, I think, I didn't think about, ahead very m uch, and the only concern 

about, let's say ahead, was that m y father should come back f rom  Auschwitz, I didn't 

know where he was, butthat's wherehe turnedoutto be. T hat where 
m y,  t hose 
were m y concerns was to remain alive and to have a fam ily, but not whether I would 

rem ember who I wasor who I wasn't, that, youknow, I think inside ofme,I knew very 

well whoI was. Sothat, Imean after awhile, even though I wasvery young, 
I 

understood that it was justnecessityand that itdidn't really change whoeverI was. 
AndI played the game, essentially.  I went tochurch, you know, I played the gam e. 
You know.  Justknew this is what youhave todoandthat wasthat.  Youknow, wen
t 

f o r co m m un i on to t he pr ie s ta nd a l l th at s tuf f . A nd at t ha t t im e Im u sth a ve bee n si x 

or seven, you know,so, atthemost. SoI just did it, you know,andIknew it wasa 

game and I knew, you know, sometim esI saidIwish I were Catholicbecause it wou
ld  
be so nice, particularly when they had communion and they had the white dresses 

and,that I really envied, you know.  And Ididstandsomewhat inawe of  the church, 

you know, it wasextremely impressive, you know, when you go intoa big church and 

t he  p
riest standthereand, you know,pontificatesand them usic and so on. That 
was impressive and Ikindof wished I could identif y withthat whole thing,but asm y 

mother told m e and many people repeated to me, that at the age of four I already 
h ad s o rt  of  
t ak en  leave of  re l i gi on , you  kno w, a nd d id n't wa n tt o obe y an yt h in g. S o 
t ha t, bas i ca l l y, I th i n k wa s s o rt of a r ef u ge, i tm a dem e,  in som e wa ys ,f e e l saf e,  you 

k no w,  if  I cou l db ep a rt of th at gro up , I wo ul db e saf e . And I do n' t thin k i t wa s , in  

retrospe
ct, such a deep religiousfeeling assom e sortoffeeling ofbeing protected, 

you know, inchurch you wereprotected.And if you're partof thatgroup, nothing 

h app en ed  t o yo u.  S o Ith i nk  i t wa s,  you  kn o w, as a  youn g k i d, goin g wi t h  the ch i l d ren 

of  th e t
own andour neighbors, Imean our landlords, going tochurchon a Sunday, I 
was, Ifeltextremely alienated, you know, inone aspect, andtrying to play the game 

and likebelieving thatmaybeI was Catholic andI couldbe Catholic andI could just 

proceed,
 
you know, f rom there on and not have to worry about being who I was.  So 
it was all confusing.
 
Q: Do you remem ber ifyouprayed?
 
A: I can't remember that, I can't remember that.  I, I m ean I know all the prayers 

because I had to pretend, you know, but I d
on 't , as I sa i d, i t 's har d to be  qu i te 

authentic, but being, knowing the religious feelings that I don't harbor now, or the 

a nt i
-
r e l i gious  f ee l in gs th at I h a rb o r a nd h a ve,  ap pa r ent l y,  s in ce r eal l y c h i ld hoo d, 
according to m y parents, it's hard to believe th
at I was swayedby anythingm orethan 
the senseof,this is going to protectm e, you know, somaybe it's worthdoing. But 
not, I don't think I had, I certainly neverbelieved in Jesus Christ or anything ofthe 

kind.  I mean, that stuff was not believable,
 
but , not tha t an yo th e r was , bu t Im ean 
t h i s i n p a rt i c ul a r,  If ound  ve r y ha r d to  s tom ac h, s o, b uta s I s a id,  the  a tm o s phe r e and 
thebig voices andthe, you know,theechoes in the churchandall the people that 

looked so,um m, youknow,they looked very happy to bethere andthey looked like 

they were participating and soon, and I wasparticipating but knowing I was afake, 

you know,and, but Idon't think Ieverprayedto anybody with conviction. Never. So 
I don't think I did.  But I did pray, because I certainly had to go to communion and say 
a l l  the wo r d s and  go to c onf e s s ion a nd  conf e ss  to  s ins t hat  Im ad e up .  Yo u kn o w, 
th in gs of th at so rt.  S o...
 
Q: You were a performer?
 
A:Ithink to som e extent,butthat waspartof the game, youknow, if I had to change 
names, I had to change everything about m yself, so I, but I knew it was fake, you 

know, I never, Ithink, totally took ontheother identity. Idon't think Iever did, Imean 
whoeverI was, ImeanI certainly got, I'm  sure I got tosomeextent, y
ou  kno w, 
damagedby this whole experience,butmaybe not, notasmuchas, if one listens to 
t he s c r iptu r ea nd yo u co u ld e xpe ct  som e bod ywh o  wo uldb em u c h wors e sh ap et han 

I, I am , m aybe, I think I was in pretty bad shape, actually, right after the war.  I 
wa s  
r e a l l y in, bu t n obo d y had t im e to pa y a tt en t ion , s o I ju st ha d t o pu l l m ys e lf  t o geth e r,  I 

think that's what happened.  I don't think anyone had the time to pay any attention to 
me. So I justhad to survive, which I had learned, you know, to survive.  
S o, th at's it.
 
Q :  T ha t 's t he  be gi nn i n g.
 
A: Yeah. But, it's very difficult, you know, I am a very successful person,ImeanI, 
and when,that's why I don't liketo go to reunionsofhiddenchildrenanym ore 

because Ifeel thatm aybe I'm justanelitist, you
 
kno w,  and th at ' s a l l the r e i s t o it, b ut 
I, thereare a lotof people who are still whining about thisand it's, Idon't, really don't 

wantto downplay it inany sense,but it'spast and a lotof peoplehave badthings 

happento them in life. And if you'
re going to just focus on those things, you're just 
not going to getanywhere and I, I can't, I cannot goand sitthereandtalk about this 

over and overand over.  And, you know,m aybe it's denialformewhich is,that's 

possible, too, I justdon't wantt
o  dea l  wit h  it  anym o r e. I m ean , I 'm  happ y to  te l l  you 
m y s to r y,  b ut I do n 't t h in kt hat  wh at ' s hap pe ning i n m y l if e no w o r  let ' s s a y to a  great 

extent, has that much to do with that experience.  I think I've, I know m yself pretty 

well nowand I, I can tell
, yo u kno w,  wh e re thi n gs a r e com i n g f r om m o r e th an j u st 
blam ing itall on the war and everythingof thatnature. So.
 
Q: You're wearing, are those diam ondearrings?
 
A: Yeah.
 
Q :  A re  tho se  f rom  you r  fam i l y?
 

A: Yes. W ell, they're actually,m y husband gave th
em  to  m e, bu t  a l l  ou r  f ami l i es  a re 
i n d iam ond s , so, I m ean bo thm y pare nt s and h i s pa re nt s we r e bot h in to d iam ond s, 
so that's Antwerp for you.
 
Q: Oneofthe things Iwas curious about reading your fam ilyhistory, yourfather's 
history, is that you're feeling toward diamonds now, because you had talked about 

how, when youf led, yourmother took thediamonds and threw them out the window.  
T h at ' s qu it e a d ram at ici m a ge .
 
A: Yeah, I always try to, youknow, save som e,totry and sellthem and that'sallthey 
ha
d, was diamonds.  They had nothing, no property, no money really to speak of, but 
thediam ondsthat they weredealing with,they could try andsell tosurvive. So, 
tha t's...
 
Q: So the ones in your ears aren't part of that pile?
 
A : No .  T h e y'r e  n o t .  I , I  
didn't, there is nothing, I mean the only diamonds actually 
t ha t su r vi ve d t he wa r , wa sm y m ot he r ' s en ga gem e nt  r in g, but n o,m y i n
-
la ws ,  a ctua lly, 
because they came here, so they, they f led, but they f led as a fam ily and they didn't 

really go through any ca
m ps oranything, so whatever they took with them they, 
exceptfor what they had tospend tobribeoff icialsalongthe way to survive,they 

cam e with quitea bit of diamonds with them, som y m other
-
in
-
laws jewelry that she 
gave mealong the years, thoseare
 
rea lly p re

war, many of them .  My motherdidn't 
h a ve tha tm uc h to be gin wi t ha nd sh ed i dn 't , sh e wa s n't ab le to  kee p muc hof  i ta nd 
so, theonly thing isher engagement ring, that's theonlythingthatactually survived 
t he  wa r  an d I ha ve t ha t.  So,  tha t'
s  p r et t y n i c e.   S o.
 
Q :  Do  y o u  we a r  it ?
 
A: No.  No, Iputthataway.  I havem y ownengagement ring, whichI actually very 
rarely wear. So, andmy m om  just passedaway, you know, and it's very hardform e 

to take her jewels and put it on, I just put them  a
way someplace.  And I think,m y 

daughter isn't married and if she does, at some point, I want to give it to her.  Because 

she was very closetom ym otherso I would give ittoher. So...
 
Q : You hadt a lk ed abou tb e ing in the c h il d re n's h om e and th e s wee tp
ot at oe s o r th e 
sweet potato
-
like things.  
 
A: Ah, please.
 
Q : A l l ri gh t, I 'm  no t go ing t o as k qu i te ab ou tt ha t, b ut  you s a id th e re  wa s a so n gab out 
i t a nd  I  wa s wo nd e r ingof  yo u r em embe r ed th e s on g?
 
A : Um m , ye s, th e re wa s a son g th at j us t cam eba c kt om e no
t t oo lon g a go wh i ch 
h ad to d o wi t h get t in gu p in the m orn i n ga ndh a vi n g to go wa sh . Ho w wa s th at ? 

[Singing in French]. So that wasasongto get our, [Frenchphrase], which is 
whatever. And[Frenchphrase] was, is thatsweet potato or whatever it is, 
I d o n 't 

k no w ifI  rem em b e r that  son g.  It  wi l l com e bac k m a yb e.  If I t h in k abo ut  it , i t wo n 't , 

but itm ight just springup at som e point. There'safellow that lives in Antwerp who 

is m y childhood f riend and he's now the only one alive because his parent
s d ie d  j u st  
overthe lasttwo years,they were in their 80'sandhis sister, unfortunately, wasa 
very good f riend of  m ine, and she died at age 21 in childbirth, so he's the only, and 
he seem s to have a better m emory than I do for these things.  I mean, he
 
a c tua lly 
went back to theplacewhere we hadbeenhiddenand looked up thepriest whohad 

been incharge of theplace and itapparently hasnot turned into some kind ofa hotel 
o r  in n and .. .
 
Q: W he re is th is?
 
A:This is inVon Deen(ph), which is in thePy
r e n ee s a nd he r ec o gn ized  it , he  s a id he 
really did and he took som e pictures and he showed me.  I don't think I remem ber it 
quite as well as he does.  And we're thesame age,so it's not amatter, he's six 

months older, so it's not a matter, I think I just
 
tu ned out a l ot of  i t.  Ju st t un ed i t out, 
it was just too awful.  So I don't think I would really recognize it.
 
Q: You were, until youwere 10, you were the only child, right?
 
A :  Ye s .   
 
Q: Did youfeel m ore responsibility because you were theonlyone?
 
A: Towards?
 
Q: Toward your mother, for example.  Responsibility to kind of keep alive and keep 
go i n g?
 
Q : W ell ,  I th i nk  I , I  took a  l ot  of  re s pons ib i l i t y on, fo r  th at f r ien d ofm ine wh o ,  be cau s e 
we were together and she wastwo years younger andas I was, I
 
would say 
essentially, anorectic(ph) and she, but not anorectic in term s of throwing up, but just 

wo u l dn ' t ea t, I m ea n Iwa s  j u st  no t i nt e re st ed  i n f ood , bu t not t ha t I ha d an im a geof 

beingfator what goesalong withanorexia thesedays, just, just sod
is t r au ght  tha t  I 

c ou l dn 't e at .  B ut s he on  t he  cont ra r y,  be i n g up se t , she  wa nt ed to  eat  m o r e,  e ve r y 

t i m e, s o we we r et he op po s it ea nd we  wo u ld go  in th e k it ch en and  stea l f ood f or h er 

at night and so I was, I felt very responsible for her.  I don't think I
 
felt responsible for 
m y motheror to stay alive forany other reason than I just wanted to be alive.  You 

know, notfor any particular reason.  No, Idon't think,I think, Ican't remem ber ifm y 

mother, you know, felt or made me feel very safe, I can't sa
y t ha t.   I th i nk I  d i d f ee l 
a ban do ned qu i tef re que ntl y be cau s e she  wa sgo ne a l ot .  So I, no , Ido n 't th i nk th e re 
wa s  an y cons i de r at io n of  m y m ot he r , of  m e d oing som eth i n g f o r  he r , p r ot ec t in g h e r, 

I think it was clearly theopposite.  Even though Ididn't 
feel that protected by her, I 
feltm ore protectedby playing the Catholic girl and going to church with our 
neighbors.  You know, I felt a lot more safe than being with her.  And in some ways, 

when she didn't learn, she didn't know French very well and she
 
learned it, you know, 
o n the  run an d sh eh ad a p re t t yhe a vy a cc en t, eve n  t hou gh s he l ea rnedt he  lan gua ge,

all. And you're interested in what'shappening after the war, soafterthe war, in 

school, I m ean I was an absolute terror.  I m ean, a com pletely uncontrollable terror. 

And,butI was smart,you know, and I knew I could get away with it 
because our 

class was m ade up of just really the dregs of the earth and, you know, people of all 
a ge s spea k in g d if f ere nt l an gua ge s.

Q: To An twe rp ?
 
A: Yeah. Andso I went to, so there w

before the war, but at thatpoint it was justsortof  in shambles and theteachers were 
them selves survivors and nothing that relatestomodernpedagogical methodshad

performed, I did everything according to what they expected me to do, but as soon 

asthey left, you know, these donorsand inspectors and whatnot, I would just go wild, 

just wild.  Infact,a couple of, aboutsix months, well eightm onthsago, I was in 
B e l gi um  vi s i t in g m ym ot he r , j u st a  wee k
 
bef o r e s hed ie d, a nd  we  wen t t oa  go

away 
partyf orm y uncle who is also80

something and whomoved to Israelwith his family.  
Som ym otherandI went to it andoneof m y Hebrew teachersf rom that time was 
t he r e and a  ve r y s t ra nge  th i n gha ppene db ec au s e I had n ot  see n th em an  in ,oh 

p r ob ab l y 3 0 yea r s , an d he cam e u p a nd h e sa ys ,  " I s that yo u?"   A nd I sa i d, " Yes" .  

And he says, " You know, look at m y gray hair, you did this to me" .  He said, well me 

and, youknow,acoupleof years. But then, so we talkedawhile,then it was really 

funnybecausehis daughter was there and shesaid, "Idon'tknow how he recognized 

you becausehe'sblind andhedoesn't seeanything".  Because Icouldn't tell, you 

know, I saw him and I greeted him  and just from the voice, or I don't know what, I 
mean it was veryf unny, very funny. So I reallymadean impressionon thisman.
 
Q :W hat la n gu a ge wa s t he s ch oo l ta u gh t i n s inc e peop le s po ke so man y l an gua ge s?
 
A :W el l se e, i t had be en , th i s i s bef o re the up ro a r, t h is  is ju st a tt he t im e  whe n the 
uproar began between Flem ish and French in Belgium, so, and this school had been 

aprivate school, it wasaprivate day school just like thereare som ehere, andso we 

were taught in French,which is, that was it, wehadtobetaught in Frenc
h a nd the 
Hebrew teacherstaught without speaking any other language essentially.  T here was 

not translation, you were taught the alphabetand that's, now kids learn very quickly, 
they really do.  I mean, all this bilingual crap is crap, it's ridiculous.  
B eca us e we  c am e 
f rom  so many different parts and we all learned French in a m atter of months.  I mean, 

I knew it but everybody spoke French in a matter of months.  Even just, and as I said, 

we didnothave sophisticatedteaching methods or language labs or
 
a n y t h in g ,  it  wa s  
j u s t. When yo u kn o w yo u ha ve t o,  you  lea r n.  
 

Q : W er e yo ua wa r e t hat the  wa r h ad en ded ?
 
A : O h ,  ye s.   O h ,  ye s, a b so lu t e l y.
 
Q: How did you becomeawareof that?
 
A:W ell,for one, in Francethey had this incredible celebration,Victory Day,
 
so  the re 
was no, noavoiding knowing it.
 
Q :  Do you  rem em be r tha t da y?
 
A : No t in gr e at det a i l, I ju s t rem embe r m o re of a n im p r es s io nofp eop l e jum p in g in the 
streets andm usic anddancing and,but I was, you know, aneight year old,Imean I 

c an ' t r em em be r

t oo k downt he,  we had  t he se b la ck b la n kets o n the  wi nd o ws be ca us e we ha d 

curfews,so you know, the light wouldn't goout, wouldn't shine in the street, wetook 
off a ll of th at.
 
Q :  W ho's  w
e?
 
A: Mymother andI who lived inthatplace.
 
Q : W h i ch  wa s i n ?
 
A: In Exleba(ph), Exleba,and theneighbors, you know, wereallso happybecause 
t he n e ighbo r , the m a n,  h ad be en  in W orl dW ar I an d he  ha d bee n i n jur ed,  in f ac t , in 
W orldWar Ia nd he had no  l
oveforthe Germansatall, sohe was, you know, very, 
very happy,even though inthis warthey didn't sufferthatmuch. Hewas too oldto 

j o i na ndh e wa s, an yway,  he wa s i n ju r ed, s oh e wa s r ea l l y, r eall y,  rea l ly h app y. A nd 

t he n, so th at ' s, yo u know,  ho w
 
we found out.  I mean, the radios and everybody was 
justextrem ely, extremely excited. So there was justa joy in the streetsand 

everybody, people pouring out f rom  every house, apartment, in the streets, there was 

j u s t t hous and s of  peo p le  even  th ou gh i t
 
wa sa sm al l to wn , i t look ed to m e l i ke, you 
know, thousands of people. I really don't know how many they were. Sothat's, 

essentially, what I remem ber. And I remem ber then, som ehow, m y mother getting 

notice that my father had returned.  And leaving me 
th e re to go f ind  h im .  So sh e lef t 
m e  wi t h tho se ne i gh bor s  and s o tha t, I  remem b e r tha t andI  rem em b e r wh en she 

c am ef or m e , s he ha d a ct ua l l yfound h im an d we  we n t ba c k and t hat  t r ip  wa s 

horrendous.  And it was in a truck, you know, just one of those truck
s  wi t h ,  n ot  e ven 
covered, but some sortof tarp cover,that's it,and wetraveledf rom  there and it took 

days and days and days.  I don't know who was driving the truck, I have no idea. 

And itjust, see,certainstupidthings, Imean, I, I was still very 
n as t yan d ve r y an gr y  

a nd at som e s top t he re wa s no th in g to d r inke xc ep t bee r and I sa id t hat I wo uld r at he r 

die than drinkbeer, you know, justas a, who knows why?  You know, Imean if you're 

really, really thirsty you'll drinkbeerandI wasthirsty, but
 
I said I would rather die than 

drinkbeer. And Idon't like beer to this day, so Im ean, why? W ho knows? Justa 
stupid, you know,detail that comestom ind. And so we wentback.
 
Q: You went backto where?
 
A :T o Ant we r p an d th e pl a ce  we ha d l ive d i n wa
s pretty much destroyed, so, in Exleba 
we hadm et a wom an whohadtwo children who wasf rom  Antwerpaswell.  And she 
owned a house and her husband had been deported and she didn't know whether 

he wouldcome back or not, but she hadahouse with severalfl
oors and she said 
t ha t she , we co u ld com e and l i ve inh e rp l ace, yo uk no w, f o r ren t .An d so we did . 

W e m o ved, m y m ot he r,  m y f a th e r,  m ys e lf , m ove d  to th at , we  m o ved  t o th e gr ound 

f loo r of  th eh ou se t ha t ha d th r ee f li ght s . I t wa s l ik e on e of  t he se  ra i l r oad ho us e s,  ve r y 

skinny,everything wasone roombehindthe other. And there was norunning water, 

I remem berthat very well. There wasno centralheat. So we had topum p the water.  

And wehada coal stove to do everything,basically. And atf irst, when
 
we  f i r st got 
b ac k , m y pa r en t s an d I we n t to a s o rt of  an i nn in th e A r den ne s (p h ), wh i c h i s t he h i l l y 

part, theycall it mountains,but in reality it's just hills, hillypartofBelgium andIthink 
that was the only tim e in his life that m y f ather ate non
-
kosher food.  
 
[ en d of  s i de  1  of  tap e 1].
 
Q:Oka y. It'sthe on ly time  in his life  you rfather ate no n
-
k os he r  f ood ?
 
A : Yea h.A nd i t wa s rea l l y to  ge t h im b ac k onh i sf e et .  Im ean , he acc ep te d tha t,  it  
was a necessity, there was no kosher food and he need
ed to j u st get b ac k on h is 

f ee t. So, we we nt , It h in k o r i gin a l l y i t wa s su ppo se dtob ef o ram ont h,b ut no so one r 

we were there, m y mother took off and she went to Antwerp because there were 

many people who were gettingmarried who hadbeen separatedduri
ng t he  wa r  and 
got together and she went to cook for weddings.  Not for money, you know, just out 

of, youknow, community feeling.  And so she left us and she would com ebackand 

forth.  You know, she wouldbedoing allthesecharity, volunteer andwhateve
r  k ind 

of  wo r ks,s o sh e d idn ' ts t a y the f u l l m on th , but m y dad and I d i d.  Andt he n we  we nt  
and moved into this place that I told you about.
 
Q:I'm  just curious, when you saw yourfather, youhadn'tseen him,fora time you 

didn't know if you would seehim, youhadbeen very closeto him.
 
A: I had been extremely close, so that was a terrible disappointment, terrible, terrible 
disappointmentbecause, well, what you rememberas a threeorfour yearoldf rom 

yourfather is very differentfrom the way you seehim at age eight or nine,particularly 

since there hasn't been a progression, you know.  So, and I was extrem ely 

disappointedbecausehe was extrem elyorthodox and wantedme tobe that way. 

A nd e xt rem e l y r i gid i nhi s , thep ra c t ic eof  re l igi on wh e r e, yo u kn
ow, he wouldn't allow 

me to turn on the light on the Sabbath, I mean he was extremely, extrem ely, 

extrem ely strict and rigid and I could not abide by this.  I just could, I didn't believe in 
i t  an d I kep t te l l in g h im  t ha t I d i dn 't s ee ho w,  af t e r wh at  he ' s 
gon e th rou gh ,h e cou ld 
stillbelieve inthis sort of stuff.  And sotherewas really a crack in our relationship 

b ec au se of th at .  You  kn o w,  he t r ied , on  o the r  f ron t s.   I m ea n,  m y f at he r  wa s  no t an 

e du ca ted m a n a nd he wo u l d m a ke an ef f or t an d ta ke m e to th e m o vi es an d I  kno w  

that this was not som ethingthathe wouldhavedonenormally,this is something he 
really didto try and regain some,some closeness withme.  Imean,I'm  surehe 
m issed it,too, but he justdidn't know how to goabout it. And Ithink 
in  s o m e  wa y s ,  

he was soiled, you know, as far as, why did he let him self be taken?  W hy didn't he, 

why wasn'the the strong man Ithoughthe was in, you know,protecting us all and 

wh y d i d he j u st d i sap pea r ? Im ean , he j ust, h ewa s  s upp osed to m ee tu s s om
ewhere 
and he never showed up.  You know, and at that time, I think I had this certain 

resentment towards him for being m y fallen hero, you know, why didn't, why didn't 

you protectus and why were you gone andwhy were you, com e back insucha 

d e c r e p i t s ta
te, you know, you look terribleand, youknow, you can't really bem y 
strongfather. You know, so I hada lotof that. And Idon'tthink I could tell him, I 
really couldn't,theonlyf ightsthat we openlyhad wasabout religion.  And I think I 
t he n ch ann
eledeverything into absolutely refusing tohaveanything todo with the 
r e l i gi on be ca u se I got , yo u  k no w,  it wa s  a l i tt l e i n co n s is te nt , l i ke a n gr y a t God l i k e f or 

allowingthis to, andthen somebody who allows thistohappen, can'texist, just can't 

b e.   
Sothat was the end ofm y religious, and wefought aboutthatfora very, very 
long time. Throughm y teens it was really bad, really badbecause there were very 

few ofus left,forone,of childrenm y age who returned to Antwerp. Andthemajority 

of  th em
 
were not observant and so, I mean their f amilies weren't, and by f orcing me 
t o,  you  kno w,  s ta y i n on t he Sa bb at ha nd no t be i n g ab l e to go  t o the m o vi e s  like 

Saturday afternoon, I was cut out from  a lot of social activities, as well, so I resented 

t h a t te r
ribly, terribly, soI was reallyangryasan adolescent. I mean,on topof 
everything else, I was not a, not a happy camper in m y youth.  Not at all.  So I don't 

think I ever, I m ean now, you know, m y f ather has been dead for 20 years or more, I 

c an  under
stand what he wasabout and how strong heactually had beento survive 
this andto be able to rebuildafam ilyandbring his entirefam ily, hisentire surviving 

f am i l y to l i ve  wi t h us af te r h a vi n g go ne th r ou gh he l l h im se lf . And m a k in g mone y j u st 

t o,  you k
now, feed all these brothers and sisters, I m ean two brothers, a sister and 
hisfathermoved in withus, into thatplace whatdidn'thave water. Hisfather, a sister 

and two brothers, right.  You know, and I just resented that awfully, I mean I wasn't, 
no
t charitable at all.
 
Q: How long had youbeen reunited with your father before the rest of hisfam ily 

c am e?
 
A: Not that longbecauseafew, whenm y parents,m y brother was born in May,'46, 
so m aybe a year or less after they had been reunited.  And that fam ily, I think, moved 

i n  wi t h, m yb r ot he r wa s  c l ear l y an i nf ant , s o Ido n 't k no w if  th e ym o ve d i n j us t bef o re 
or,he was born, or rightafter, so that'snot clear inm y m ind.  Butthey, m yfather 

found some sm ugglerandhe paid him a lotofmoney to go and rescue whoever was 
left.
 
Q: W here were they?
 
A:W ell,they were actually in Siberia. T hey made itto Siberiaf rom Poland. AndI 

don't know how he found out about it, I really don't know.
 
Q : T ha t wa s  go in gt o be m y ne xt  que st i on.
 
A : I  do n' t kno w,  b ut  the y
, they were people com ingf rom  various placesand they tried 
tofindpeople who weref rom  the sam e villagesthatthey had been andthen they 
would, Ithink it's just wordofm outh. On the otherhand,they knew, sincem yf ather 

had been inBelgium since 1933, hisfam ily knew that, at leasthe hadbeen in 

Belgium, they didn't know whether he, wherehe wentduring the war of  if hehad 

e ve r , ifh eha d st a yed or if h eha d re tu rned , if he ha dn 't s ta ye d. So I thi n k the ym i ght 

havetried to contact the, you know,
 
Je wi s h  Ref u gee  A gen c y and  th at  s o rt of t h in g. 
So it was probably a little bit wordof mouth,a little bit through official channels, you 

know, Jewish__________or som ething like that. I would imagine that that's how 

they f ound each other.  Because they
 
knew at leastto lookforhim  in Belgium  where 
he didn't know whereto lookfor them at all. 
 
Q:So less than a year,obviously, if yourbrother wasborn in '46?
 
A :  Ye s .
 
Q :  Af t e r yo u got  t o gethe r a s  a  f am i l y,  su dde n l y th e f am i ly d ynam i c  c han ged .
 
A : En tir
ely. W hatare you doing here? Sylvan(ph)?
 
[Greetings exchanged between parties in the room  and someone who came in 
--
 
t ap e tu r ned  of f  b r i ef l y].
 
A:So, yeah the dynam ics changed completely f rom being afam ily with justonechild, 

t o a  f ami l y wi t h  t wo  ch i ld r en and  un cle s an d au nt s and  gra ndf at he r , to  bo ot .  And I 

felt that m y m other was com pletely unavailable to me, essentially.  Because she was 

c om
pletelyhassled, Imean, butagain, I can seethat now and asan adult, but asa 
child, Ididn't see thatat all. Imean, it was justlike now you get this stupid baby and 
all these otherpeopleliving with us, youknow, and now then we couldmaybebe 
h ap
py or, you know,have, you're not there. Andthen she was running all her 
volunteeractivities on top ofeverything else.
 
Q:So tellm e what it was like, you're, what,10yearsoldor som ething?
 

A :  Ye ah, abo ut 10 .
 
Q : And yo u ' ve got ahom e wi t hou t r unn i n g 
water, with all sorts of people, m any of 
whom you've never met before.
 
A :  Ye ah , m os t of  t hem .
 
Q : And yo uh ad sa i d ea r l i e r, th at th i s wa s a t im e  whe n you r ea l l yn ee ded a tte nt i on 

and you really didn'thave it.
 
A: Yeah,that's true,I didn't haveany. At lea
st, I felt I didn't have any, I'm  sure that I 
didhave, you know, I meanm y basicneedswere taken care of,Imean I had food 

on thetable andIhad clothesand I went toschool andIeven, wellIdon't know if in 
that apartment, a little later, I got piano lessons because I was dying to play the piano.  
S o th e y b ou ght m e  som e k ind of  s econd ha nd up r i gh t p i an o wh i c h I sti l l  r em em be r .
 
Q: Do youstill play?
 
A: Notmuch,no, I always say I'm  going to gobackto it, but, Iusedto play quite well, 
but I didn't 
r ea l l y pu r sue  t hat  ve r y m u ch, af te r  1 5 o r  1 6 yea r s of  a ge I ga ve up .  So 
again,it was amatter offeeling, you know, in thatfirst place, it wasa railroadhouse, 

a s I sa id , so the ki tc hen wa s a l l the wa y i n t hef ron t, be h ind i t wa s som e th i n g wh i c h 
wa s  m o

I  d on 't  kno w wh e the r  m o nths , ho w l on g, but t he  f i r st , f o r su re , m o nth  t hat  we l i ved 

t he r e, 
m y pa r ents  an d I s le pt in o ne bed  and  the bed  u sed  to co l la ps e.   I t wa s 
extrem elyf rightening.  It was, Idon'tknow what it wasmadeof, it was some cheap 

woodbedand it would justcollapse and we wouldfindeach other, you know, on the 

f loo r .  An d m y f a
therhad these incrediblenightmaresand he wouldbe scream ing, 
aside f rom  that.  And I had m y own nightm ares.  So it was a nightmare, it was hell, 

absolutehell.  And then,again, I can't sayfor, it's six monthsora year, theybought 

m e  som e kin d of  bed
 
whereI was inthe so
-
c a l le d  din i n g room  and t he  f am i l y, th e 
additional, the uncles and aunts and that group, moved to the third floor, so we had 
the f irst, ground floor, the fam ily, the owners, had the f loor right on top of  us, the 
owner's husband did no
t come backfrom thewar, so she was with two childrenby 

herself, so she needed the rent, and then the top floor was for the two uncles, the 

aunt and the grandfather. Butfood wasall atour house,everything, laundry,food, 

everything. W ithout refriger
a to r , wi t hout  an y,  yo u k no w, f an c y ap p l ianc e of  an y k i nd, 
s o i n s om e wa ys ,  in s om e  wa ys  it wa s a lm o st wors e t han duri ng thewa r .  Be ca use 

d u r in gt he wa r , Ih ad som e ki nd of s tab i l i t y, Im e anf o r th e la s tc ou p leof  ye a rs  when 

I lived in that house inExleba, as I said, I was interror but it was, tosom e extentI 

had accommodated to the terror.  T here was not that much unpredictable that was 

h app en i ng. W e ha d o ur a i r ra i ds  an d we ' d ru n of f  an d go t o the  s he l te rs ,  b y t ha t t im e 

I  ha d o ne n am e and th at  d idn 't 
ch an ge anym o re an dI had s om e so r t of  rou t in e. And 
m ymother, when shewas there, was thereforme, there wasno, shehadall these 
people that she was hiding and so on, but still, I f elt that she was there, you know, for 

m e . W e wou l d go to th e bea ch t o
gether on occasion and we would do things 
together, whateverthey were. Butthen she disappeared,essentially.  She was 

d i l ut ed so m u ch to su ch an e xtent t hat  in som e  wa ys , If e lt m o re ab andon ed tha n 
during the war, even though I wasn't af raid for m y life.  I mean, and so m y, I think a 
lot ofthat anger wasdueto thefact that I was just lost, you know, just,itfelt likeI was 

t o ta ke c a re of  m ys elf pl u s ta ke  care  of  m y b r othe r.  W hi c h I  ha d to do , I m ean  I had 

tobabysitfor him and,because we couldn't
 
affordany help, andm y mother was just 
unableto doeverything, she was doing__________careform y brother, you know, 

d a y an d n i gh t, so  whe n I  c am e hom e f r om  s choo l , I me an I h ad to wa t ch  m y b ro th e r, 

Ihad to, I learnedhow tocook very early because I
 
had to help for, you know, for 
making a m eal for Friday night for 10 people without, you know, appliances, I mean 

on a coal stove and it was a Friday night and f or Saturday lunch and for Saturday 

evening before you could turn onthelightsagain. Imean,
 
th at  sort of , s o I  ha d to  
p i t ch  in , com e hom ef rom  s cho o l F r i da y ea r ly a n d he lp  m ym ot he r o r  wa tc hm y

m i s ch ief and we wo u ld  ju s t do  it .  A nd so we  c on t in ued th at .  A nd we establ i she d, he 

was very m echanically gifted, in fact, he's an aeronautics engineer for Israel, for the 

Israel governm ent, so that really pannedout. And we would just build thingsand 

we ' d  bu i ld som e  k i nd of t e lep hon e b etween h is  b ed and m i ne and  we 'd go  t o t
he, 
t he r e wa s a f le a m ar ket  e ve r y S un day m o r n ing an d we 'd go a nd we 'd bu y a l l th es e

U nf
ortunately,he left for Israel when,Imeanhe and hism otherand sister left when 
he was about13, sothat wasa terrible loss.And weused to, we were inseparable, 
inseparable, but wealso wouldf ight.
 
Q : W hat  wa s h is n am e?
 
A:Bobby, Bobby Ackleman(ph).
  
I don'tknow what they callhim  now in Israel,but, 
and he, we would f ight and he was stubborn and I was stubborn, and so we wouldn't 
talk for weeks on end, and we'd go to school together and we'd walk one behind the 
other, without exchanging a word.  An
dt hen  we ' d wa it  f or ea ch ot he r to go hom e , we 

wouldn'tsay a word. It's very funny. W e hadalot of im aginary gam esandthen we'd, 

we'd build swords, swordsoutof wood, and shieldsand paint them . Andm yf avorite 

book was the Three Musketeers, and so 
I would readthat overandover and over 

again. And so we'dplay the Musketeers andwe'd have swordfightsand,soI had a 

good time,I mean it'snot like I was completely m iserable at all times,but I think I was 
very troubled, you know, a very troubled 
pe r so n.
 
Q:W hich Musketeer were you?
 
A : I th in k I wa s  __ __ ___ ___ , you kn o w.  A nd we  ha d a n a r ea  no t f a r f r om  the hou s e, 
which now is really built up,but it was,they calledit in Flem ish,the Barta(ph), which 

is likethe countryside, youknow, and it was 
really ver y rural, there was nothing, there 

were someoldfortificationsf rom  W orldW ar I and we'duse those, youknow, to hide 

andplayand have war games and really notvery, you know, pacifist typeof , but 
mostly like little boy's gam es, youknow.
 
Q: Yo
u ha dm enti on edt ha t wh en  you we r e ve r y yo u n g, you r f at he r t r ea ted yo u as if  
you were a son.
 
A: Yes, yes.  AndI think that carried through. But, in addition,because that little girl, 
I m o gene( ph ) , m y f r ien d,  I  ga ve  he r  m y do l l  and  c a r r ia ge tha t th e y bou g
h t f or m e , I 

just had zero interest in it. Even when I,even before the war, you know,form y 

p a re nt s to bu y som et h in g li ke th at  wa sa  t r em e ndo u sf i na nc i a l sa c r if ic e andI had 

absolutely no interest,none. So,but having this kind ofafriend reinforced 
the entire, 

Im ean I wasn't just passively doing what he was doing, butI really enjoyed it,I really 

enjoyed those gam es.And, but he was greatbecause he was somechanically gif ted 

a nd he,  ap pa re nt l y,  d idn 't h a ve a be tte r  f r i end , yo u  k no w,  a m a le f r iend
, so I ju st ha d 
todo,basically. AndIthink he was, you know, Ithink we weremutually, you know, 
in love with each other. Im ean, we only,because when he leftfor Israel, heusedto 
send m e these terribly, you know, sad letters and how he m issed me a
nd, which was 
nothis type at all becausehe was very withdrawn and very noncommunicative with 

other people.  Very, very closed person except with me, you know, and we met when 

we were six or seven yearsold. And Ihaven't spokentohim  in afew years, bu
t I had 

a bou t six, s e ven  yea r sa go I d id ca ll h im  up wh e n I wa s i nI s r ae l be ca us e I don ' th a ve 

a lot of time when I go there.  Mostly, because I'd like to see him , but, and I think he 

still likesme a lot, youknow.  It was clear, atsom epoint Icame, whe
n I  wa s  abo ut 

17 or so and he was,at that time, hemust havebeen 19and thenheshowed some 

interest inm e whichI could not respond to.  You know,I just wasn't, Im ean I loved 
him as a kidand I lovehim  stillasaf riend,butI wasn't interested in hi
m  roma ntica lly 
and he was, you know, so Ithinkthatsort of,Idon't know, I guessby now it doesn't 
matter any more, but there was a tim e when there was a break, we couldn't really 
comm unicatebecauseIdidn't wantto hurt him and so we just left it.
 
Q : 
So allthese relatives who were living up onthe thirdfloor,they didn't helpatall, 
they didn't do anything?
 

A:W ell, I'll tell you, you know,they,my aunt, she'sstill alive, I could show youa 
pictureof them , Icanshow them to you before the war andafterthe war, it's very 

telling. My aunt wasa very depressed person and, you know, inthosevery orthodox 

f am i l ies, you h ad to  getm a r r i ed  youn g,  if  you d idn ' t,  it  wa s te r r ib l e.  S o he r ye a r s 

wh e r e she sho u ld ha ve be en m a r r ied , pa ss ed , yo u kno w, a nd s
hewas not very 
attractiveat thatpointand she was very bitter,very bitter person. And a depressed 
person, soI don't, sheacted as if m y mother was her mother,butm y mother was just 
afew years older than she wasand had gonethroughhell herself and
 
ha d a f ami l y.   
She really expected my m other to do for her.  And m y mother did.  So I don't think 

she helped a lot, at all.  The m en, m y father, you know, paid for their apprenticeships 

to becom e diamond cutters and diam ond whatever, but one uncle then to
o k th a t o n , 
s o ,a nd h e wa sn ' t going to he lp i n t he hou s eho ld , Im e an tha t's ju st unh ea r dof . An d 

to behonest, he worked long, longhours. Imean, he would takediamonds hom e 

and he would have the machine at home and he would work 12, 13 hours, so you 

co
uldn't expect him to do a lot.  Not that he knew how anyway, but it wasn't part of 
the culture, buthe wasn't just sitting there and doing nothing. Im ean, and theother 
uncle, hadbeen ateacherandso he tried to learndiamonds,but he really wasn't 
gi f
t ed an d soh e go ta  jo b i n the  sc ho o l, t hat  He b re w s c hoo l . A nd s ohe r em a in ed a 
teacheruntil his retirement. Andm y parents,m y grandfather was inhis60's and he 

really, certainly wasn'tgoing tohelp in the household,hedid try and do odd jobsto 

ear
nafew dollars here andthere, Imeanfranks, it wasn'tdollars,but he wasn't a 
parasite in the sense of sitting at home and hoping to be catered to, but in essence, 

culturally, youexpected a daughter
-
in
-
law to take care of the father
-
in
-
law, you know, 
the father.  And he did try, he started a little business of, he would wrap packages 

and take them  to the post office for people who would send food and gifts and 

whateverto Israel, you know, people whohad re
-
established contactwith relatives 
who were f
rom their country,from their town and they wouldsendthem food or 
whatever, clothes, whatever they could save and gather. And so hewouldpick itup 

attheirhousesand he would wrap it upandhe would ship it.  Andhe gota little 

comm ission for doing 
that,so, you know,hewas trying to participate in som e ways 
f inancially, you know,even if it was justtobuy himself, you know,his own pocket 

m o ne y to bu y h im se lf  som e c l ot he s an d th i n gsof that  na tu re .  So it ' s no t t hat  he  wa s,  

that they were mean or bad people, they just came f rom  a culture where it was, I 

mean their mother had eight kids, so it was not, you know, that's what they were used

"W ell, I wish you a lotof  luck".  Butshedid, shem arriedher off.  AndI'm  notsaying 

that it was the happiest marriage ever, but it was

through.  And they had three daughters and he's dead now, but the daughters are

you'd go to church,but it's, you know, anactofpresence,Im ean you show up,that's

to take in the entire family, they just took in m y mother's f riend's mother and so, they 

moved to a very nice place with

I was so jealous.  And Ikept saying, you know, if we didn'thaveall these peoplehere, 

maybe we could m ove and have a nicer life.  And I m ean, I made no bones about 

that,asI said, I was not charitable inthe least.  And then when they moved out, we 

did move to a better place.  It was not as nice as what these people had, but at least

There's a park in Antwerp, just the central park of Antwerp, and

what she wanted, andshe would lie becauseshe gavea lot of itto charity, but see, 

hedidn't know that.  So she would say, well, Iboughtm yself adressfor, you know, 

a thousand dollars or som ething ridiculous and he co

where did you have an idea that you could afford a dress for a thousand dollars?"  
A nd sh e wo u ld sa y,  "We l l , you k no w,I ne ede d i t". O r s om e thin g l ik e th at,a nd then 

they wouldargue like crazy andthen he would give her,I'm m a
king up a number, 

she probably never bought a dress for a thousand dollars, but the equivalent now, 

let's say, andhe wouldsort of shake hishead and, you know, couldn'tbelieve it. But

Q: So you don't color between the lines?
 
A: No, theonly think I knewand that's whyI got
 
p u she d t o m y, and  eve n  ab o ve m y 
age, was I could readextrem ely well.  And thatfooled everybody. PerhapsI didn't 
understandeverythingI read, but I could just read veryfastandbecause that, see 

that was one thing which now tells me I still am addicted to books, I mean I'm  really 

addicted.  I,ImeanIdo terrible things, I will readthroughthenight and Iknow that 

k i l l s m y ne xt  da y an d I j u st ca nn ot  sto p.  S o i t 's  r ea l l y an  addi c ti on , i t 's  no thin g e lse 

but an addiction, and that I picked up, I thin
k,was a real escape as, in those years 
where Icould just totally ignore what was going onaroundme and pretend it wasn't 
so and just im merse myself  in those books, but it was, I don't even know, because 

thefirstbook I read I think was Forever Amberandthis was so inappropriate. I 

couldn'thave possiblyunderstood what was goingon, but I just stuck to itandthen 

was GoneW ith theW ind or stuff like that.  I mean, as a six year old, you know, and 
i t ' s  t ot a ll y in ap p rop r i ate, bu t  b ec au se  of  th at  I r ea l
ly knew how to readextremely well 
a nd that wa s wh y th e yp lac edm e, so th e yd idn ' t che c k o nan yt h in ge ls e and I kne w  
n ot h in g e l se. I j ust knew n ot h ing, Im ea nIc ou l db a re l y wr i t e, bu tI wa s up the re, I 

wa s  p ut  in f ou r th  gr ade.  S o I  wa s i n th at  s choo l .  
And then, as I said, I had told m y 

parents that I wasn't going to be, you know,marriedat 18,or I wasn't going to marry 
at all, basically, and I was going to become a doctor.
 
Q: You knew thatthen?
 
A :  I  k ne w t hat  t he n.
 
Q: You weresix?  Nine?
 
A :  Ni n e .  I
 
wasnine. And so, because ofthat...
 
Q:W ait a second, holdit,hold it, you're skipping over this. Howdid you know that?
 
A:Idon'tknow, I just knew I wantedto besomethingand doctor seem edextremely 
heroic, soI guess I was very impressedby thedoctors I went to.  You know, they 

seemedto havesuch power and, you know,everybody was very deferentto doctors.  

So, Idon't think I was in it really to help people,I think I was in itmorefor interest. 

So, that's whatI was going tobe.  And, so in 
order to do that, I couldn't stay in that, 
see that school was,as I said, in shambles,it was the rem nantsof a pre

sort of  baccalaureate type of  exam .  So, and you had to, in order to get to university, 
at thatpoint, Antwerp becamea
 
F l em is h t o wn , s o yo u ha d t o go t o a pu b l ic s ch oo l in 
Flem ish. I didn't know any Flemish, reallynot,Imean I just knew afew words to talk 
to the cleaning womanandIdidn'thave a lotof interaction with her because when 

she was thereI was in school and Ihardly ever saw her. Sothatwas a bitof a 

p r ob l em  be ca us e  you  ha d  t o ha ve  an a dm is s i on s  te st  in  Fl em is h.   So, I  do n' t  kno w, 

see people think m aybe I'm  lying, but I'm  not, I mean I went and I took the test and a 

f r ien d of  m ine  cam e wi t h m e  a nd  s he  c op i ed eve r yt h i n g f rom  m e an d s he  d i dn 't get 

in.  So, but I don't know, I m ixed French and Flem ish and whatever I could think of, 

you know, inthe answers.  Im ean,the, I don't know what the questions wereand I 

only had three yearsofelementary school andeverything was, really,I knew nothing 

really well except reading, that'sall I really knew. W ell, the rest I knew, math was 
t e r r ib l e, be ca us eI d id n't  ha ve t hee l em e ntary st uf f , you kn o w, I wa s r ea l l y bad . A nd 

so I got into thisextremely, extremely difficult public schoolthathad six years of 

studies. And in orderto goto university, youhad totakethe classic tract, sothe 

classic tract was Latin and Greek.  Plus Flem ish, of course, which was the main, plus 

s i x ho u r s of  m ath  a week .   I  m ea n, th i s
 
was really horrible, andm yexperience at that 
school was terrible, justterriblebecause there wereonly twoJewishgirls in it and 

even though it was really asecularschool, it wasapublic secular school, because in

though they didn't live th

kindof  joke wehave, is if we haven't heardfrom each otherfor a long time, she'll

your religion,that'sokay with me, but I'm not goingto help you. You'lljust whatever, 
you know,do it yourself" .  So we did, this girlandm yself,and wehadsix miserable
 

years.  But somewhere in between, in 1951, I believe it was, m y f ather's imm igration 

papers, he had applied to come to this country in 1933, and of course, the Americans 

h ad no  in te nt io n of  sa vi n g a s in gl e J e w so they m ade  su r e he did n' tge t t he pa pe rs

said,
 
" I 'm  no t go in g to su r vi ve  an ot he r  wa r, I jus t , I wi l l  no tb e ab le t odo  t ha t" .  So we

because by then she had established herself, she was happy in Antwerp, she had all

Q: W hat 
did you do?
 
A: But I wasn't a teenager, theAmericanteenager, we were verydifferent. W e were 
really entirely different.  So,f irstofall, we weren'tdating as teenagers.  Not atall. 

W e,mostofm yf riends, and that's another thing, there were two, tw
o se t s ofpe op le , 
there was one setlikemyf riend Regine(ph), who,shebelonged toa Jewish 

o r ga n i zat i on,  l ik e a yo uth  m o vem ent .  An d t he y wo u l d m ee t o n e ve r y Sa tu rda y,  s om e

Zionistic, strong Zionistic feeling.
 
Q : W hat  wa s i t ca l l ed?
 
A: That was the __________, and I think it's still ongoing, it was part of  the 
_ ___ __ ____ se c t ion . Th en th e
re were other youth movements that were very left 
wing which were__________, and they were very Socialist and I couldn't gotothat 
because m y father would have killed m e and I didn't like the other one, so m y f riend 

andI kind of parted the ways, parted ways. And infact, Ithink I wasalso notm uch 

of a,I wasn't functioning very well in a group,I was really an individualist,too, I 

couldn'tfunction,I gotbored.  I just got bored. I went with Regine just tobe withher 

for awhile, and I really could
n't, I justcouldn'tdo it. So I went toa couple of cam ping 
trips, you know,forthe summer where we,and I had a very good time,I, onthose 

trips because that wassort offurtheraway f rom homeand there was less control. 

A nd th en, if  yo u ' re wi tha bu nc hof  you n g peo p le c am pin g, th e re i sn 't th atm u ch you

a tt r a cted m e.
 
Q:W hat was your senseabout going toAm erica?
 

A: I wasn't sure, youknow, I wasn't surebecause,but I wasn'tthatha
ppy over at 
home. I wasn't having a great social life really, I had apretty m iserable social life 
b ec au se m y s ch oo lm ate s we r e not Jewi s h, e xc ep t f o r th i so ne gi r l , and s o we d idn 't 
d o a l otof  so c ia l i zi n g wi t h th em .
 
Q: Just because they weren't Jewish o
r ...
 
A: Yeah,I think we were, they weren't Jewishand we hadallthese restrictions, you 
know, on going thisandgoingthat,and so it was very hard and they didn'tunderstand 

anyof it. Imean theysimply couldn't understand what we weretalkingabout. 
 
There 
were two, actually, I think thatourfirst year ofhigh school, I think we were som ewhere 

near 60,divided in three groups,one that wasn'tplanning to gotouniversity, so they 

werenot the Latin,Greek typesand I think two who were going to unive
r s i t y,  so  o u t  

of 40,nine graduated. Andout ofthosenine, there was these two Jewish girls, 

Nelsie(ph) and m yself.  And two other girls that we have, that we did becom e friends 
with over the years. And infact, I think the Nelsiem ight still be in touch withat least 
o ne of  t hem .  And  I k no w wh e r e the y a re at  le as t , you k now,  so i t ' s n ot  l ik et he y' re 

totally lost.  But it tooka long time,until som ething gelled. And at thetimethatI left, 

it was about, I was beginning tofeel abitbetter and I knew
 
Flem ish by then, and I 
was, I was really doingvery well.  And so it was a littledifficultto leave. Buton the 

otherhand, it was likea bigadventure going toAmerica, you know, it was som ething 
terribly attractive. And I didadjust, really,Imean I
 
hated Borough Park.

hada numberof siblings that,unfortunately, I only
 
met one or two of them  and I don't 
really know, I think there may have been six or eight, I don't really know.  One of them 
cam e here inearly1900's,and infact,m y grandfathercameas well.  But he went 
back toPoland, he's one of those people whocam e

ridiculous.  And m y father was yellingather. AndI was yelling ather. But, she was 

always onthe side of the, you know, the loserand the underdog andthe, youknow, 

you have to do this, you must do this, and what's the big deal, so we have one m ore

education, m y mother was anything but primitive, and the people who they 

associated with, again, had no education, but were very, they were street wise and 

they were, they had aveneer of worldliness about them  becausemost 
t hem  had 
been, they'd been to South Am erica and Am erica or Switzerland, so they, they had 

abetter,they hada much widerexperience. And they had to adjust very quickly, so 

m a n yof them  l ea r ned S pa n ish and t hen  the y l e a rn ed F r en ch an d th en t he y l ea rned

d i dn 't  kno w h im  th en .  B ut , so , m y f ath e r wa nted t o sen d m e the r e b ec au s e it wa s a 

Hebrew school, but they wouldn't take me because I hadn't gone to Hebrew school 

all these yearsand I was very far,far behind. Sothen another recentimmigranttold 

h im  ab outt he Ju l ia R i chm on d (ph ) H i gh Sc ho ol  in M an ha tta n, wh i c hat the t im e wa s 

apparently a very, a very good publ
ic  s c hoo l .  A nd s o I we n t the r e.  An d a l th ou gh I 
wa s ,  I had  f in i s hed the th i rd  yea r of h i gh s cho o l the r e in,  t he i r h i gh s c ho o l is  s i x,  I 

m e an i nB el gi um , be cau se ofall m yLa t in an dG r ee k and s tuf f , th e ydid n 't k no w wh at 
t o d o wi t h m e.  So the y pu t m e i n t
he graduating class. Soagain, I was like 
disconnected f rom having a coherent education.  And, and I didn't know English, I 
knew just a littlebit from , you know,a littlehigh school English,Imean after three 

years of high school, how m uch English do y
ou know? That's all Iknew.  Andsoit 
was again,a struggle to just know what was going on in class, but it was really simple.  
I m ean, it was not hard.
 
Q:W hat year was it that yourfam ily left, I know yousaid...
 
A :  ' 51 .
 
Q:It wa s '51?
 

A :  ' 50 , '51,  
som ething like that.  So again, you know, I was like at sea, but at least I 
didn't have school on Saturday.  And in m y view, they always had no school because 
I  wo u ld  go to s c hoo l f r om e i ghtt o s i x.  An d he re  we' d go,  the  gr adu at e,  the  se ni o r s in 

high scho
o l , Id on 't know,  yo u  kno w,f rom t en t o one  o r f r om ,  so I s tart ed e nj o yi n g 
this,I said,"T his is a lot offun" .  I'm graduating, Idon't know anything,but I'm  going 

to collegeat, youknow, 16because I'mthrough, youknow.  And Imean,I knew it 
was going tobe a problem  because I really didn't, I didn'tknow anything. Im ean,I 
knew nothing, I just,Idon't know, I just sortof skimmedby and m anaged to learn 

enough English to beableto readandI was heretil about May. At which pointm y 

mother decidedthat it's notforher.  Myfather wasnot well,m yf ather was a sick 
m a n,  a l l t h rou gh out .
 
Q: You were living in Manhattanat this time?
 
A: Yes, that, we were living in one of those efficiency type apartments onWest 72nd, 
Idon't remember what it was c
a l l ed , it  ha d a  nam e,  it wa s a s o rt of  hot e l,  ap artm en t 
hotel.  And it was f ine, I mean it was m uch better than Borough Park and, and I met 
a very nice young woman at Julia Richmondand she, she wantedabsolutelyto have 

m e da te, so s he wo u ld in t ro du ce m e.
  
S he th ought  I wa s  t hi s i nc red i b le k i d , you  k no w,  
because I was very differentf rom  everybody else.  And she usedto introduceme, 

these guys who were much older, who were, youknow,f rom  Yashiva(ph) University 

types. And Ididn't want Yashiva University
 
t ype s .  The  h at  an d the  th in g,  b ut  I  m ea n, 
I dateda coupleof times, youknow, and Iwas very uncomfortable.Thedating 

situation was, wasn'tmeat all. Andthenm ymother said, you know, m yfather was 

having horribleheadaches andhe wasn'tfeeling well and she just couldn't getused 
t o th ea non ym i t ya nd so r t of  la ck of  in te r ac tion an d the f ac t th at he r  b r ot he r wa s  in 
Borough Parkand itbecam ea wholehassle just to go to BoroughPark, you know, 

everything was a hassle. InAntwerp, you can walk to mo
st of you r f r i end ' s and 

everything, you know,you can walk todowntown and youcandoall your shopping 

o nf oo t.  Im ea n, th e re is  pub l i ct r an sp o rt ati ona nd peo p le use i t, bu t it' s n ot l i ke th e 

n o is y sub wa y and , yo u kno w,  a l l of  t ha t.  T he r e' s  n ot th at m an y,  it ' s n ot  c r o wd y and 

noisy andfilthy and, youknow, scary. So we,we returned, we went back.And that 

was, so, Ithink we got hereprobably around February and Istarted schoolattheend 

of F eb r ua r y and  I wa sto  gr ad uat e in J une , bu t t ha t wo u ld h a ve 
be en  a r ea l  m i st ak e.   
A nd  wen t bac k i n Ma y,  a nd  of cou r s e,  I  ha d m is sed  f ou r  m on th s  of  Lat i n and  G ree k 

a nd  t r i gon om e t r y an d I m ea n,  ho r r o r s.  A nd so  t he y sa i d,  " L oo k,  you c an r epeat  a 
ye a r o r you can t r ya ndc r am ". So I sa id I 'd t r ya nd c ram . And I d id,I cr am m ed . And 
Ifailed only one subject and that was hist,not history, geography. So they letm e 

t a ke a make up and th en  th at  wa s it. So Im a de  it tom y gr ad e le ve l an d contin ued t il 

theendand graduated in, can't remember what year, '55Ithink. Som
ewh e r e  a r ound 
t he r e.
 

Q : An d th en  wha t hap pened ? W hat  wa s i t  li k e go i ngba c k to A ntwe r p,f i r st ?
 
A:W ell, yeah,by thetime we left, Iactually like itbecause, hey, as I said, I was 
graduating,I knew I didn't really know anything, but Ithought I couldfa
ke  i t.   An d I 

wa s  da t in g, a lt hou gh Id i dn 't  l ik e the  sc ene , the r e wa s s om e th in g k ind of  n i ce ab ou t 

it. AndI wasbecoming more independent. So Idon'tthink I was lookingforwardto 

going back to Antwerp at all.  I think I was, by that time, beginning to
 
op en up t o t he 
possibilities of much more freedom.  And the possibility of meeting a lot m ore people 

inm ay age group. InAntwerp it wasextremely restricted and,asI said,there were 

som e that were going to these religiousthingswhich I wasn't goingt
o go  i nt o.   T he re 
were some that were going to thenon
-
r el i gi ous  one , I m ea n s till the o rga n i ze d Z io n is t 
group, I couldn't join that because m y father wouldn't let m e and besides, as I said, 

I'm  notsure I wasthattype. And thenthere wasa groupof  very
 
rich kids, or at least 
acted asthey were,asif they were very rich, andthey were very sophisticatedand 

h ad th e i r h ai r  do ne i n n i ce  p la ce s an d we cou l dn't  af f o rd tha t.   So I wa s n' t r ea l l y 

c om f o r tab l e wi t h th em e i the r. S o I wa s qu i te i so l at ed and h ad j
us t, and t hen  t he 
p r e ss u re wa s  o n t o ju st  get m a r r ie d.  I n a l l  t ho se  gr oup s , you  kno w,  and  I  m ea n I 

couldn't deal with thisatall. I simply couldn't deal withthis. SoIhad two orthree 

f r ien ds, gi r lf r ie nd s m ost ly,  ti l  t he e nd of  h igh s c ho o l.  An d we'd
 
ju stm ee t in ea ch 
other'shousesand comm iserate,basically. Com plain abouthow terrible life was in 

A nt we r p . And s o tha t ' s ho w it wa s un t i lI  gr adua te dh i gh s ch oo l. A nda t im e, ab out , 
whenI wasstudyingform y bigfinals in high school, it was around
 
the holiday of 
P en te co st,  you k no w, __ ___ _____ ,m y,  one of m y un c le s,  M ye r , yo u kn o w,  who h ad 
l i ve d  wi t h u s,  an d h is wi f e h ad ta k en an a par t m en t f o r th e mont h of  Jun e at the  

seashore and they invited m e to come for that holiday.  So I came and I brought a
l l 

m y books tostudym yfinalexams. And I was studying on the beach because it, it 

wa s  the  m on th of Ju nea nd i t wa s not h i gh s eason yet ,t he r e we re j u stf am i l ie s wi t h 

young children. Andthis one guy, you know,approachedmeandhe was a young 

m a n f rom  
Antwerp, but just a few years older than I was.  And we started dating.  So 

then I had sortofa good timefor awhileexcept thathe wanted to getmarried.  AndI 

justdidn't want to.Imean,I justdid not. You know, I just knewthatIhad to hang 
onto 
whatI had saidandI wasn't going to cave in. And so that,didn'thave anice 
ending, but I started m edical school.
 
Q: In Antwe rp ?
 
A: In Brussels.  There was no medical school in Antwerp, there is one now, there 
wasn't one.  And again, that was really a 
m i st ak e becau s e I wa s n 't rea d y.  I m e an, I 

wa s  17 and  in Eu ro pe ,t o th i sd a y,m ed i ca l s choo l i s r i ght af te r hi gh sch oo l , so the r e 

is,there isno college tokindofbuffer. Andmedical school is seven years, so you 
doall the sciencecoursesthat you wouldnormally do in college, you do in thefirst 
year ofm edical school, alltogether. And in addition, youdoanatom y. And the 

cadaversandm e, that just didn't work out very well.  Notat all, I couldn't take it. So 
infact, I becameanorectic again, but
 
again, itwasn't like, youknow,I thought I was 
fatandI wasn't going toeat, but I stoppedeating because, just theodorwouldpursue 

m e an d I r ea l l y th ink tha t tha t h ad ac onn otatio n wi t ht he co nc en t ra t io n cam p s and 

with having seen those horrible pic
turesandhaving seenm y father theway he looked 
wh e n he cam eba c k. A nd e ve ryt im eI 'd  go , it wou l d ju st s o rt of f la sh . And I wo uld 
get sick, ImeanIsim ply couldn't deal with it. SoI was inm edical schoolfortwo 
years,but I quit.  I couldn'tdo it
.  And I lost maybe 10 pounds, 15 pounds, 20 pounds, 
I  wa s  r ea l l y d is i nt e gr at ing.   So  tha t  wa s on e p rob l em .   M y ot he r p r ob lem  i s, t he  sc hoo l  

was in Brussels andmy father wouldn't letme live inthedorms, whichmeans I had 

to comm ute, which means Ihad to
 
get up every m orning atfive,beonthe train at 
seven andbe awake in classat eight. And comebackat 7:00at night.  Sothat was 

one very difficult, and the otherthing about thatwas thatthatfirst year was, you know, 

m a th an d ph ys i c s  an d ch em i st r y 
a nd th es e we re th i n gs tha tI  ju st d idn 'tk no w.  Im e an, 

Ifakedm y way through high school,basically,but Ididn't know it. And Ididn't know 

it enough to jump to calculus, for instance.  I mean, I just, so I was really struggling 

andI gave it up. Ime
an , I  j ust  c ou l dn 't  h and le i t .
 
Q : W er e the r e ot he r  wom e n i n yo u r cla s s?
 
A :  Som e.
 
Q: Othe r Jews?
 
A: Yeah, actually, I traveled on the train with a bunch of , I think there we were four or 

f ive. But thatuniversity, we went to Brussels andBrussels isa very
 
anti
-
c le r i c a l 
university. It wasactually erected asa reaction to Catholicism . Sothey were very 

f reethinkers,Imean that was, soIthink that theJewish aspect was lessof aproblem 

t he r e. T he peo p le the r e  we re t ru l y se c ul a r.An dI do n 't r ec a l lf e
eling, you know, no, 

infact,Im ade a lotof friends.  Mostlym en,though.  And that was very badbecause 

Antwerpstillis, you know, a small gossipy town. Andfor the daughter of Natan(ph) 

L e is e r t o b e s ee n wi th a no n
-
Jew was close to prostitution.  I mean, I think they 
equatedthat essentially with prostitution.  SoI hada really bad reputation inAntwerp 

and m y father was shattered that I would do such a thing.  And there was no talking 
sense intohim , you know, there was justnotalking sense intohi
m  a bout  th at  i t  m e an t 
nothingand, andbesides, I was going tobefriends with whoever I was goingto be 
f riends with.  And it was badenough that I couldn't stay intown, you know, that I had 

t o do thi s ho r r i b le th i n g. A nd I had a  go od t im e, I m e an wi t h  
all the difficulties, one of 
the fellows was Jewish and is actually now a cardiologist, had, was a good 

m a th em a t ic i an , so we , h e wo u ld t ra i nm e i nm ath on the t r ain at se ve n in t hem o rn in g.  

And he managed to make m e pass which was a feat, I m ust tell you,
 
this was a feat.  
A nd ano th e rf r i end , Im e an he ' s, th i sm a n isa c a rd io l o gist and i s ve r y,  you kn o w, 

good reputation, is at the Universityof Brussels.T he otherfellow is themedical 

director of the chief university hospital in Antwerp. W e're still in 
co n ta c t, not f re q u e n t,  
but incontact. And the otherone wasa womanand she'sa pathologist andshe's 
d i vo r c ed an d s he ha s  on l y on e c h i ld. A nd I t h ink  th at  wa s ou r  l it t le  gr oup o n th e t ra i n.  

Four or five of us.  And then there were non

Jews and we were

a nd , in f a c t, m y f r ie nd s,  pa r t i cular l y __ ___ ____ _ wh o i s t he m ed i ca l d i r e cto r  of  t he 

Middleham (ph) Hospital in Antwerp, he's stillf riends with thesepeoplethat we 
studiedtogether, so Ithink the religion wasnot im portant there. At 
that point it 
became com pletely, just irrelevant. T hese people were really very f ree thinkers and 

educated and it was no longer aproblem . And I don'tthink,atthatpoint,thatI 

considered it as much as a problem  as I did, you know, before where I, I f
e lt  
dim inished and Ifelt inferior.  Ididfeel inferior. And I was struggling, youknow, just 

t o ke ep af loa t.  And t her e , I wa s  st r u ggl i n g,b ut i t had n o lo n ge r to do wi t h  no t go in g 

t o s choo l  on  ho l i da ys  as  m uc h as it  h ad  to  do wi t h  m y r ea l l y l ac k  of  p r ep a rat i on  in 

ve r y s e r iou s sub j ec t s and t he n m y un ab i l i t y, ina b i l ity to d ea l wi th dea d b od ie s .  I m ea n 
that was a serious, but it had nothing to do with being Jewish per se, you know.
 
Q : W hen you sa y i t r em in ded you of  p ic tu res yo u 'd s een of ca da ve rs  and of 
your 
f at he r , it r em in ds  m e of  wh e n  you  sa id  t ha t yo u and  you r  f at he r  an d m ot he r  wo u ld be 

in the sam ebed and you'd wakeup with your own nightmares. Do remem beranyof 
those nightmares?
 
A:W ell, yeah,thenightmares were just terror,plain terror because,
 
see when m y 
mother was away, wellf irst ofall, theterror when wefled and we werefollowedby 
t he , you kno w,  in t hese wo od s an d we we r e  run n in g a nd hea r i ng the Ge rm an 

Shepherds, I mean until, until maybe 10 years ago, if I even saw a dog f ive m iles 

away
, I would,I would just disintegrate, Im ean Icouldn'tdeal withadog.
 
Q: So that's what you would have nightmares about?
 
A: I would have nightmares about fleeing, I had a nightmare about being caught, I 

had nightm ares about bom bs because we, frequently as m y m other was away, when 

she was fencing those watches and going to Switzerland, I was alone at night.  And 

t he r e wer ea la r m s , you k no w,  f o r bom b s and I 'd r un wi t h the pe op le i nth eh ou se ,b ut 

I hadtomake it outof m y own apartm entfirst.  You know, at age seven, eight, you 
k no w,  and  it ' s, th e s i re ns a r e go in gan d i t' s l i k e, and  you hea r d the bomb sf a l l i n g and 
you never knew if you were going to be next.  So that's the kind of nightmares.  And 

t he n I als o h ad n i gh tm ar e s abo ut , t ha t ho m e I  h ad bee n, be cau s e t hat wa s f a r f rom  

being fun and I had nightmares about having lice, which I had had, and I think I said 
t ha t onm y tap e abo utcu tt i n gof f  t he ha i r , th atwa s  j u st t he  wo r st , th ewo rs t .
 
Q: Do you still have a thing about hair?
 

A: I love m y hair, but I mean I don't know that, I mean I'm lucky that it's nice, but I'm 
not,maybeI havea thing abouthair,I don't know, Im ean I'vemadem y hair ina lot 

of different ways and I've colored it red andevery possible way, so maybe,but 
I don't 
know.  I don't know if it's different f rom any woman really that has nice hair.  And as 

you get older, the rest of you becomes not so nice, so I hang onto a few things that 

a r e st i l l re as ona b l y loo kin g.  M y ha i r i son e of t hem , so I don ' t kn o w if  t
here's 
som ethingmorethan what you would expect,you know, tofavor the things thatare 
s t i l l ni ce ab ou t yo u. You  kno w,  a s yo u' r e k i nd of  ge tt i n gi nto th e t wi l i gh t.
 
Q : W hat  d id  you r f athe r l oo k  li k e?
 
A:W ell, he looked like a skeleton, he looked awful and his teeth were moving, his 
hair had fallen out, he had, his feet were huge, I m ean his legs were swollen from, 

you know, when you don't eat protein and you sort of, everything turns into water, so 

h eh ad s wo l le n le gs .A nd he we igh ted 80 pou nds, yo u kno w
,  I m ean, a nd h e wa s 
t a l le r than  I am .  And  I'm no t ve r y t a l l, b ut I  wei gh  100 p oun d s and I 'm  r ea l l y no t th at  

fat, so considering a man who was, you know, f ive six, he wasn't tall, but I mean he 

wasf ive six,five sevenor som ewhere around there,to weight
 
80 pounds, that's 
pathetic. Imean,his cheeks weresunkenandhe could barely breathe, you know, 

he wasevery, youknow, inhaling was like you'd heard noisesand itwas terrible. It 

was scary.  Imean, it was really, really scary andthen he had these 
nightm ares and 
then he was very irritable, extremely irritable, and he'd get angry and he'd yell and I 

hadnever saw him  like, Ididn't remem berhim  this way.  I mean,he wasn't that way.  
So, it was veryhard. Very hard.
 
Q:So to jump inourf lashback sequencefurther closeto the present, youdropped 

o ut  of  med i ca l  s c hoo l ?
 
A: Dropped out of m edical school and didn't really know what to do with m yself.  But 
I  kne w I  wan te dt o st udy,  yo u k no w, I ju st f i gu re d thi s i s l i ke a brea k .A nd I ,I wen t 
and worked 
f o r  a yea r  or  s o.
 
Q : W hat  did  you  d o?
 
A:W ell,again, you know, I was sortof an,essentially becauseI was a con artist, you 
know, and like Ifakedm y way through school, Ifakedm y way through elem entary 

school, Imore or lessfaked m y way throughhigh school,fakedm y way through, you 

k no w,  to gr ad ua te he re, Im ea n it wa s a l l, I kne w en ou ght o p ut to ge th e r som e th i n g 

that looked fine, but it was really not f ine in depth.  And so, this one person I knew 

who is now in Boston,Mim i(ph), she, she lostherfat
her during the war and she and 
her brotherand motherlived inAntwerpand Mim i is stilla very strong individualand 

s he  de c ided the r e wa s n o f ut u re f o r them  at a l l i n An t we r p an d so t hey we r e  go in g to 

i m m i gr at et o the St ates. A nd th e y d id . And she  wo r k
ed as an office manager for a 

man who is Am erican who had this business in scrap plastics, so he'd buy plastics 
f romfactories andhe would sellthem all over Europeand I guess theywould recycle 

them essentially. And sohe was a Germ anJew who lived in 
the  S ta tes  an d he  wou ld 

com e every summ er to Antwerp to sort of oversee his business, the rest of  the time, 

s he  wa s ru nn in gt he of f ic e .S o, I too k tha t jo b. I k ne w no th in g. H e coul d on l y sp eak 

German, this man, and we'd correspond in German and, or som e
 
English, but mostly 
German.  I neededto do accounting and Ididn't know anythingabout it.  Ineededto 

s e l l s tuf f an d qua bb le ove r  t he p r ice and I h at e, Im ea n I was19 , yo u kn ow, I ha d no

picture,not,not really knowing what I wasdoingbut enoughto,and I rem ember 

clearly, clients com ing inandthey were lookingfor theboss, you know. I said,"W ell, 

I represent him".And they were like," Oh,m yGod, you know, wha
t i s t hi s ?"   B ec au se 

I looked very, very young, very young. Imean nowm aybe, I lookm yage,butthenI 

d i dn 't , I rea l l y, I l oo ke d15 at th em o s t, at the m os t ,a nd tha t wa s st r et c h in g it be ca use 

I couldn't get into movies where you hadtobe17 without ID,Imean they wouldn't let 

me inat all.Andso,but I, I reallydid an okay job, you know, Ididn't lose theman 
anym oney, maybe Ididn'tdo as well as someone who really knewwhat they were 
d o in g, bu tI m an a ge d th eof fi c ea nd the r e wa s t wo s ec r et a r ie sa nd the r e wa s a l i ke 

chief  accountant, but I had to present the stuff in the way that this person could, and 

I was their boss, which was really laughable.  But I did it, I did it for a year and then I 

said this is clearly notm y avocation. AndI toldm y motherthat I was going to goto 

Switzerland to study becauseI couldn'tdo it inBelgium  becauseI wasn't going tobe 

able to,this comm uting business wasn't forme.  Andshe supportedme, you know, 

s he  s uppo rt ed m e.  And I left  f o r S wi t ze r l an d, n ot kn o wi n
gatall whatI was going to 
do, not knowing anybody there.
 
Q: You'd been accepted into med school?
 
A: No, Ididn't go tomed school, I wasn'taccepted intoanything,I just tookm y 

luggage, I went on a night train, I got to Geneva at six in the m orning wi
t h  cof f er s  and 
coffers, you know, becausem y mother hadpacked God knows what,and stoodthere 

andhadno idea where to go.  Andf inally managed to geta cabandthere was a 

Jewish __________, as I'vef igured, well, I'll go there. At least somewhere topa
rk  

m y stuff.  And I did, went there, and put m y stuff and immediately f igured that I didn't 

wa n t to s ta yt he r e f o r ve r y l on g be ca us e it  was o neof  thes eo r tho dox t h in gs a ga in 

andI said, "T hat's really lovely, I'll stay a couple ofnights,butI'm notstay

s o th e re  were s om e ot he r  stu de nt s the r e, o b viou s l y, an d the y he lped m e f i nd a,  you 

k no w,  the yhe l ped m e th r ou gh the  rop e sof  gett i n g an e ws pa pe r and f in d in ga p la ce 

tostay. And Ifound a room to stay.  Andthen I went to register and, honestly
,  I d id n 't 
know for what.  I reallydidn't know. AndI'm standing on line, you know, infrontof 

the register, you know, thetelleressentially. Andthere was these two Swiss girls 

and they're talking and we started talking, I asked them  what are you registering for, 

andthey said, "Oh, we're goingfor adegree inbiology" . Isaid," Okay, I'll do that, 
too".  I mean, it sounds really idiotic, but that's how it happened.  So I went and I got 
adegree in biology.

, just Christiana(ph) istheonethat I'vekept intouch with, butI 
always hear about Christiana. And that'show I starteda biology degreeand 

s om e where in  t he  m id st  of  a l l of  th at I m et  m y h us ba nd .  I m et  on e woman wh o i s an 

I s r a e l i a n d I 'm st i l l ve r y 
f r i e nd l y wi t h  he r , i n f a ct , s he  ca lled m e o n Sat u rd a y.  A nd s he 
wa s  i n t he i nt e rp r ete r sc ho o l, oh  yeah , th at ' stheo the r th i n g, a l l th e gi r ls wh o we nt to 
school to Switzerland were in interpreters.  I didn't want to do that because I still had 
m y vi e ws  o n  
a real job,you know. And som ething thatI was interestedin.  So biology 

was just, just great.  Myf riendthatImet,Elana(ph), was an Israeli woman who was 

justa lotof fun,she'sagreat gal. And she was in interpreter school,so we became 

re a lly go
od f riends and I had these two Swiss girls, Christiana and Josiana(ph), and 
we becam e good friends.  So immediately Ihad a groupoff riends.  Andso,of course, 

m y parents were very worriedabout, is she ever going to getm arried. AndI said, 

" Loo k , I 'm  
going to study, Idon't know whatI'm goingto study,butI'm going tostudy 

s om eth i ng an d I'm  n ot ge tti n g m a r r ie d" .   So t hey we r e  ve ry up se t be cau se  t he r e h ad 

b een  seve r a l ca nd i dat es i n be t wee n th at  I  d id n 't  m ent i on  f r om  th i s f el l ow wh om  I m et 

a t a ge 17.
  
T he re  wa s a bu nc h of t hem an d I did n 't  l ik e an y of t hem , I al wa ys  h ad an 
excuse. And one was even aphysician and, because I said, well this is uneducated, 

this isthis, this isthat,what's with the doctor? Youknow. Isaid," I justdon't love 

h im .   
That's it.  I don't love him. I'm not marrying somebody Idon't love andthat's 

t ha t" . So, the y we r e get t ing re a l l y co n ce rned an db yt ha tt im e I wa s 21 ,2 2, and th is 

is really getting to be the old maid.  So everybody was concocting, you know, to have 

me
 
meet men.  So unbeknownst to me, there were relatives of  his in Antwerp who, 
he had relatives there who he used to come and visit for holidays and so on.  T hey 

told him aboutme,about thisnice Jewish girl and, you know, when you're 22 and 

s om ebo d y te l l s
 
you,nice Jewish girl, you say,oh, yeah, right. T he samefamily told 
me about him  and I said, "Anybody who needs to be introduced by his uncle, I don't 
even wanttoknow about". So,but I didn'tsay anything, I said, "Oh yeah, really" . 
A nd  I k ne w s om e
 
of,there werea lot of American students studying m edicine in 
Genevaat the time.  Those who wereessentially there becausethey were Jews 

b ec au se the r e wa s  c lea r l y a  quo ta of  no t adm i tt in g J e ws  tom ed i c al  s c hoo l  in  the 
U n i te d  Sta te s . S o  th e y c a m e  to S w
i t ze r l and and  h e wa s  o ne of  t hem .
 
Q: So he's Am erican?
 
A:W ell, he was born inBelgium,camehereduring the war, wentbackwith hisfam ily, 
of  course, in 1946, but f or some reason or other, his parents couldn't get used to 
Antwerp again, they went back to
 
the States.  So he was essentially raised here f rom 

t he a ge of f ou r on.  W en t to Co lum b i a Co l le ge , di de xt r em el y we l l , bu tf o r th e qu ota 
reasondidn't make it intomedical school rightaway, they wantedhim to wait another 

year, it was very complicated,h
e said, screw you, I'm  going to Switzerland.  So he 
cam e to Switzerland. And so this ishow people werekindof planningto getus 

t o get he r . S o I k ne w s om e of t he  o the r m e d i cal  s tu den t s wh o  we r e the r e an d I to l d, 

so I m ust say, I had seen Sylvan(ph) and 
Ididn't know whohe was,buthe was really 
h and s om e .  A nd I s a id , gee , a nd h e lo oked to ta l l y non
-
Jewish, blue eyes, light hair, 
just what I needed.  And so I really wanted to meet him .  And I told som eone, " Do 

you know this guy Sylvan Kleinhaus?"   Hesaid
, " Yea h,  he 's i n,  yo u  kno w,  m y 

medical" .  I said, " Just point him out to m e because I want to m ake sure that I don't 

meethim" . Sonext time weare in the cafeteria together,he says,"That's him" .I 

s a ys , " No". So he sa i d," Ye s," h e sa i d, "W h yno ?"  I 
said, "Oh, that's a long story, I'm 

not telling you why" .So wemetand interestingly enough,he knew myfriendElana, 

separately, independently.  And so we becam ereally,thethree ofus, youknow, very 

close and she was dating another m edical student at
 
the time. Andso wemet and 
we started to date and we got married about a year later.  Even though I said, I'm not 

getting married.
 
Q: Did you have a religious ceremony?
 
A :  Ye ah .  Well , t hat  I d id n 'tm in d,  you  kno w,  tha t I , se e I  wi l l  go  f or  thef o rm , I  
st ill, I ' ll 

go, I go to synagogue now and I attend on the high holidays and I bitch throughout 

t he e nt i re th i n g, bu t it 's,  bu t I am , i t 's a n et hnic  i de nt if ic at ion.  I f ee l  in som e wa ys ,

with us, as I told you, they all live in Israel.  And, and I went the
re f or  on e sum m er 

after I graduatedhigh school, so I really tooka loveforthis country. Fora varietyof 

reasons.  And I think that's probably where the war has marked me the most, is that 

I f ee l s o st r on gl y i den t if ie da s a Je w an d I canno t s tan d it  wh

Q: You went toIsrael after high school?
 
A :  Ye s .
 
Q: You didn't tellmethis part.
 

A:W ell,there's somuch, you know. I went toIsraelasa,essentially, a graduation 
present because one of m y father's sisters who had, 
had  gon eto  I s rae l i n  1 933 .  So 
wh e n m yf ath e r cam e to B e l gium , sh e, o r s ho rtl y the r eaf t e r, m a ybe '36 o r so , we nt t o 

Israel as a pioneer essentially, went to kibbutz.  She was clearly not orthodox, or 

became not orthodox, I don't know what shehadbeen at home. And so she was 

living there, shem arriedthere, she hadtwo children thereand som yfather sent me 

t o he r  f o r th e sum m e r af te r  I gr ad ua ted .
 
Q: So this was the early 50's?
 
A: Yeah, '55 or so.
 
Q :  T he  hei gh t of  Z ion i sm .
 
A: Yes.  And height of poverty,
 
h ei gh t of  rat i on i ng,  he i ght of  re al l yp r im i t ive  c ond i t io ns.  
I  m ean,  m y au nt  a nd  he r  th r ee,  the th r ee  o ther  m em be r s  of  he r  f am i ly li ve d  i n  t wo  
room s, essentially.
 
Q:W here was this in Israel?
 
A:It was in T el Aviv.  And I went thereandIhavea cousin wh
o is about approxim ately 
a year younger or so,I can't,I don't know exactly, we're certainly the same generation 
except that she was aSabra(ph) andI was born underdifferent circum stances.  And 
u nf o rt unate l y,  whe nI cam et he r e, sh e wa s qui te i l l, s he ha
d k id ne y st on es  an d s o, 

s he ' s suff e re df rom  th at sin ce th en, s he 'sn e ve r be en en ti re l y we l l , al thou gh s he's 

had, you know, a fairly normal life, but she's had health problem s throughout.  And 

she knewonly Hebrew and I didn't know any, or youknow, again, 
th r ee  yea r s  of  
elementary school,that was notexactly sufficient to, so I was ina sortof desperate 

statebecauseI wanted tomeet people. So I just really byf orce learned Hebrew, you 

know, just keptaskingher, what'sthis, what'sthat, Im ean just co
n t inu ously and  th e 
dictionary. Andby the endof thethreem onths, I wasfluent.  Really f luent.  Don't 

know how to write, still to this day, I write terribly andI read very slowly, but whenI 

speak, people think I'm  a native f rom  those three months ther
e .  So, and  I  m ad e a lot 
of friends.  And it was just lovely becausem yaunt wasn't religious.And so Friday 

night we'd go toparties and, you know, it wasjust a completely different,and then, 

whereas in Belgium, youknow, youfeltJewishbecause you we
r e  gh e tt o i zed  and 

because ofm y experience in high school, over there, it was justa wonderfulfeeling. 

Andatthetim e,the country was just so safe. You just could goanywhere.  AndI 

wo u l d h i tchh i k e a c ro s s the wh o le c oun t r y an d n obo d y t hou gh t an yt h ing
 
ab out  it , you 
k no w,  i t wa s  ju s t a n or m a l t h in g to do .  Nobod y l oc k ed th e i r doo rs ,  it wa s j us t 

wonderful.  So I did that before I started m edical school, so that was m y graduation 

f rom hi gh s ch oo l.   An d I m e t a f e l lo w t he r e wh o a ls o be cam e a bo yf r i e nd an d 
wh o  

dragged inm y lifefor several yearsonandoffbecause he was in Israel and he was 

apainter.  He'sdead now, unfortunately,because several yearsagoI went back to 
Israel actually looking for him  and someone told me he had died.  So...
 
Q: You were in schoolin biology, you graduated and gotm arried,after graduation, 

before graduation?
 
A : Bef or e gr ad uat i on . Ye a h,  we, b ecau se I  got m ar r i ed a ye a r af te r I s t a rt ed s ch oo l.  
A nd  s o I wa s  23 .  A nd  I m o ve d i nt o h i s p la ce , h e had  a  li t t le s tud io,  an d he wa s
 
in  
medical school, so wegotmarried in Apriland...
 
Q:Of wh at yea r?
 
A : 196 0.  A l on g t im e a go .  A nd we , th e sum m e r , we cam e  he r e b ecau s e h e had 
wantedto transfer to an Americanm edical school.  Andhe gotseveral interviews. 
H i s  pa r en t s l i ved o nW e s t 
96 th an d Cen t ra l ,no t Ce nt r a l, R i ve r s id e Drive . A nd we 

weremarried in April andIdidnot wantto go live withhis parents. And theycouldn't 

understand it.  So we,dom ineering people, particularly thefather, and I insisted that 

we move to our own place.  I said, " I don't care if it's a hole, but a place of our own". 

And we did, they did getusa place in theW inderm ere (ph) Hotel, which was west 

som ething or other, 90, 91st, I'm  not sure, and Broadway, I think it was.  Or, yeah, I 

think it was Broadway. But we, it was very diff icult. I cam ehere,hestarted to do 

som e externships (ph) and interviewing in medical school and then I said, I wasn't, I 

d i dn 't  f in i s h, Im e an I wa s s t i ll , had I th in k a yea r o r two to go .And Is t a rt ed lo o k in g 

at various colleges tosee how I could continue whatI was doing. And itlooked 
extrem ely difficultbecausethe curriculum wasn't thesame andoverthere it wasonly 
science,buthere in college, youneeded all these corecoursesof English, literature 

a nd so  on an d I
, really hadalready lost two yearsofmedical school,one yearof 
working, I didn't want tostart, I was on thetrackandI just didn't want togetoff it now.  

S o we ha d som e d if f i cu l t t ime s r i ght af te r we  got m a r r ie db e cau se t oh im  it was 

certainly much
 
moreenticing totransfer toamedical school, get anAmerican degree 
and have not to deal with any of this foreign business.  But to me, it was hell.  And 

also, Im ust tell you that Geneva was, andperhapsstill is,butit wasparadise on 

e a rth, it wa s j
ust beautiful.  Just, justbeautiful. And wehad, you took in life, you 
know, we were very much in love, we lovedwhat we weredoing,the surroundings 
were beautiful, you know, I  mean we'd go to the lake,Lake,now Ihear it'stotally 
polluted,but you k
no w,  lun cht i m e we ' d goan d s wi m ,  we 'd ta ke boa t ri d es, we ' d go 
up in the mountains. Imean,hisparents were very wealthy sohehada car andI 

mean, we justhada life,thebest life, you know, no responsibilitiesexcept toour 

s t ud ie s . And  rea l l y en joy
 
lif e, for me, almost I would say for the f irst time, really, really 
e n jo yi n g m y l if e .  I  m ean , I ha d had  m om e nt s , you kno w,  th at  I h ad a go od  t i m e and  

when I was inBrusselsI had a good timeand when I wentto Israel Ihad a goodtime 
a nd he r e and  the r e I had a  good t im e, b ut I ha d m o st l y I  wa s som be r , yo u kno w.
 

Q : W hen d id  you s to p be i n gna s t y?
 
A : I th i nkp ro ba b l yb y th e t im e I go t to Ge ne va I s o rt of h ad th at  st r aigh t ene d out . I 
became, you know,happyand I stopped,maybeI, I still,I'm stillnasty t
o peo p le I 
don't like.  I mean, I have a certain level of tolerance, but once that's exceeded I, I 

think I'll go absolutely through fire for people that I love, I mean I will leave no stone 

unturned and I will, you know, even harm myself , but I will not, I
 
h a ve  ve r y l ittle  
toleranceforpeople thatIdon't tolerate, so, whenthey reach the point where I can't 

takethem  any more,there is almost no, there's alm ostno return.  So I'm not tolerant, 

I'm  very intolerant. But I'm not nasty.  Notanym ore, Idon't
 
th i nk  I'm,  I  do n' t  t h ink 
people think I'm  nasty, but I am  not very tolerant.
 
Q: Okay, so you're at sea here, your husband has these externships...
 
A :  M y i n
-
laws are a big pain in the neck.  Big pain in the neck because they want to 
control us and I didn't
 
wa n t t o be con t ro l l ed.  N e ve r  di d I  wan t to b ec on t ro l l ed , and 
the lastthingI wantedtobe controlled by ism y in

Sabbath,he said,he never said a word anymore. Never. W hich was, in retrospect, 

really remarkable. W ithm y in
-
la ws
, it was justthe opposite. And Ireally couldn't 
take it,I could not take that acting,they wanted meto bea certainway andI was 

nothing like it.  My mother
-
in

law neverdidanything outside ofthe house, she was a, 
p r et t y m u ch a sl a ve tohe r hu sb and. And th e yexp e c te dm e tob e t ha t wa y,  you kn o w, 

a nd I re al l yha dt o ld S yl van whe n wem et an d we  s ta r ted da t in g t ha tI wa s go in g to 

have a career andI wasn't quite clear yet as to what it wouldbeandhow I would 
manage it, because I had nomodel, youknow, to go by. ButI would do that. I was 
not going tobeahousewif e, under any circum stance was I goingto bea housewife.  

So, and even though he came from a really different picture, I think he just loved me 

e nou gh to a gre e wi t h it in p r in c ip l e,m a ybe
 
hedidn't knowexactly what it wouldentail, 
but at least he was able to say, "Yes, I'll go along with it".  And he did, I m ean he 

reallydid. But,his parents wereup inarms. So while we were still there,one 

p r of es sor f r om  a n Am er ic a n un i ve r s i ty, so 
we went back to Switzerland because I 
really didn't want to stay.  And reluctantly heagreedto come back. And we went 

back to Genevaand we weretherefor another three years.  And while Ifinishedm y 
degree, I got a job as a teaching assistant.
 
Q: W he re
 
was this?
 

A: In Geneva, in the departm ent of physiology.
 
Q: A t?
 
A:The University of Geneva, it's called. AndIgot two jobs,two part
-
time jobs which 
turned out to be two full
-
timejobs.  You know,I was just wanted,by thattim e I was 
really interested
 
in science. Andthe professor whohad taughtus physiology was 
justam azingand I wanted to workof him inthe worst possible way. And it wasalso 
o ne of  th ep l um b  jo bs,  wa s t o wo rk f o r thi s ,  t o be an a s s i st ant t o P rof e ss o r 

_ ___ __ ____ wa s l i ke . I  can ' t
 
e ve ndesc r i be i tt o yo u. A nd I m a na ged t o get a jo b 
likethat. Becausenormally he would only give it tom edical students,but I im pressed 

him  enough, I took his course and I got the maximum  in all three parts of  the test, so 

he said, " Okay, I'll take y
o u" .  So I wo r k ed  t her e  a nd  I  wor ke d i n the  D epa r tm en t of  
Biology part

time. And while I was there, aman camefrom theStates, he wasa 
professorof pharm acology at Downstate(ph)Medical Center in Brooklyn,he was 
thereon sabbatical. And Iasked him if
 
he wouldtakemeas a graduate student. 
And this wascompletely against all rulesbecause youhadto take GRE'sand you 
hadto have this and that and theother, soI really kindofm anipulatedhim andfinally 

he just said okay, you know. So he was staying another six months when we went, 
we came to the States,Sylvan gotan internship.
 
Q : W hen wa s  th i s?
 
A: And that was 1963.  He got an internship and I was adm itted to the Ph.D. program 
at Downstate on this man's word, no papers, no nothing corresponding 
t o wh a t  the 
requirements were here. Andhe said, "But, you betterdo well,because really,I'm 
p ut t in g m y he ad on t heb l oc k f o r yo u,  so yo u bet ter d o we l l " .  So  wi t h th is  adm o n it i on , 

I  sta r ted gr adu at e sc hool . A gai n, I had rea l l y a l an gua gep r ob le m b eca u
s e the  on l y 

English Ihad learned wasfor those threemonths whenI was at JuliaRichmond High 

and that was very hard to study, you know, science inthat language. Imean,I really, 

so it was an adjustm ent period again, but I mean that was, I knew some En
g l i sh , I 
wasn't totally, it'snot like whenthef irsttim e I cam e.
 
Q: This was your third time.
 
A: Yeah, it was. SoI cam e,butthe secondtimeI wasdoing nothing because I was 
depressed, whatI did that summ er, we werehereforthat summer,I wentevery
 
s in gl e 
day to the__________, which is, that, you know, that,I don't know if  youknow that 

movie house,becausethey were showingf oreignf ilm s.  And I would just go in there 

as soon astheyopened andI wouldstay tildinnertime. AndI couldn't care le
s s a bo ut 

anything else.Sawa lot of very goodm ovies. AndI was sometimesalone in the 

movie, you know. And I'd come home andwe'd goandhavedinner athisfolk's 

house because we had to have dinner at his parent's house every night.  And I was, 

I  ca n
not say how m iserable.  So essentially, you know, I pretty much put an 
ultimatum , you know, if we goback, we goback, if not, I'm not stayingm arried. 
Because I can't, I can't deal with this whole scene and not being able to really f inish 

college within 
a year, you know, having to do all these extra things, I didn't want to 
do that at all.  So as I said, we went back and I met Professor Firchcot(ph) and 

m a na ged  to  con vi n c e h im  to t a ke m e o n to sc ho o l,  wh i ch he did .  A nd  I ca m e to

because Icouldn't really dateanyone and Icouldn't really, butIdidgo out with a

very little money, we were making a grand total of $4,000 between the two of us.  So, 

not even enough to pay the rent, but our parents were helping us out.  T hey really 

were, so both, I m ean his parents helped very nicely f inancially, but there were strings 

attached to it.  And it was difficult.  I mean, that relationship remained difficult for a 
l o n g t ime.
 
Q: So when you had kids, let me turn this over.  [end of side 1 o

your kids a religiouseducation?
 
A: Yeah, in the sensethatI put them  in Jewish school. And,butIdidn't, Imean we

thoughtthat this was

was aGod or thatthey had to believe in God. It wasallsortoffor, really, tradition.

stilldo when I canand invite lots ofpeople justas it had been at home.  But, Imean, 
I, they, none of m y kids

we  
laugh a lot, you know, we jokearound the things that are being said, Im ean when 
the kids were younger we did itmoreauthenticbecause they were learningthe stuff

f inished all his residencies in general surgery and decided to do a specialization in 

children's surgery. So there were several possible places wherehe could do it and I 

said, wehaveto get out ofthis country.  I mean, Brooklyn was such abadexperience 

thatI equated all of Americato Brooklyn andIsaid," I got to get out ofhere" . So we

wentfor the inte
r vi e w I d i dn 't  te l l th em  t ha t I had a ch i ld be ca use a t t ha t ti m e,  to  be a 

wom an was really not a plus.  T o be m arried was even less of  a plus, to have one 

child wasprettymuch lethal andto be pregnant witha second was,you were,had 

ze r o  chanc e sof  get t ing an y k ind of po s it i on  ins c i en ce ,n one , ze r o.  So I d idn 't te l l 
them  I waspregnant. But then, you know, comes __________ where it 's kindof 
hard. I don'tknow, I was so panicky. W hen I got thereI said, "Look, you know,I 

wasn't forthright, but I'v
e  go t one ch i ld and  the se con d o ne i s o n th e wa y.   B ut , I 
prom ise you I will work, I will continue to work" . And he wasnotpleased, them an 

was notpleasedatall. But, Ihad gottenan MRC Fellowship which wasalso quite 

p r e st i gi ou s and I ha d go tt en th at  rea l l y ba se do n re c omm en da t ion sf rom  t he peo p le 

who had trained m e.  So he necess, he really didn't have to pay me, I was getting it 

f rom  the Canadian government, so he f igured, okay, I'm  not wasting that much 

resources on this person.  And so, I went to
 
McGill(ph) and he went to San 
T ristine(ph), which isthe French hospital, but sincehe spoke French,having studied 
in Switzerland, there was no problem and they were very grateful to have an 
American whospoke French. That was anicetouchto it. And, so wewere in McGill, 

Im ean Canada, and thenKarin was born over there. I wentbacktoworkf ive days 

after she was born.  And,because I, you know, Ifelt thatI hadto, I just felt that Ihad 

t o d o t hi s.  An d I r ead  th e la s t d raf t  of  m y t he s is  in th e hos p it al , ha vi n g h ad th e b ab y.  

Andflew to New Yorktodefend m ythesis six weeksafter I gave birth, and it was 

very funny because I couldn't sit, you know,Iwas really tornandImean it was,I 

s t ood  the e nt i r e f li gh t an d wh en I got  to  B r oo k lyn ,  I  had to d ef end  a the s i s.   A nd m y 

thesis director wanted to do me a big favor and requested f rom  the committee that I 

should be allowed to sit.  Because I had just given birth.  And I said, " No way.  I'm 
not sitting". I said,"I saton the plane,I just want to 
stand".  You know, and all men, 

of  co u r se . An d, s o I def e nde d the  t he s i sa nd th at  wa sf ine a nd we we n t ba ck to 

Montreal and we were there until 1971 where he f inished his training and I kind of 

f inished m y doctorate, m y post
-
doctorate fellowship, but I di
dn'thave a job coming 
back.  So I f igured I have to get a job after he gets his because, obviously, he's going 
t ob e m a k in gm u ch m o re m on e y th an Iam .A nd m y j ob wo u ld ne ve r be th at reliab le 
a s a sc i en t is t. So he got t he jo ba nd we c am eb ac k , we bo u gh t 
a house,actually his 
father bought us a house because we certainly couldn't afford a house, and his father 
died right after. It was terrible. By thattim e,Iwas pregnant with the third one, so...
 
Q:W here was thehouse?
 
A:The house was in New Rochelle. And Sylvan was workingat Montefure(ph)and 
that's where he got, he's been working there ever since.  So I, well, things kind of fell 
apart in that, again, I was moved to a place where I didn't know anyone.  Now I'm two

becausethisone lady that wehad hired came whenKarin was six, six m onths old, 

by the time we cameback she was three, wecam e back, and shefollowedus. So

so,butdecided thatI wasn't going to lookfor a job beingpregnantbecause with three 

this clearly wasn't going to work. SoI didn't,I stayedhomeforabout eightm onths. 

And towards theendof m y pregnancy,I started sending letters to people w

And Isaidthat they have tohelpme inthe letter, and at least grant me an interview. 
 

S o, on e o r t wo of  them  d i d, and  on e in p a rt i cula r , I t ol d h im , " Loo k , eve r yb od y sa ys  

that it's no point, there is no point training women because they have children and 

they don't work.  I'mtrained,I have children,but I want to work. So, are you going
 
to  
helpme or not?"   Sohecould say, he couldn'tsay no, so he got me a jobasa 
research associatefor,at Rockefellow University which is,obviously, very 
prestigious. And I was therefor about a year and then started sending outallm y

but I made it
 
to research professor because I was in a clinical department and so I 

couldn't really become, not having the MD degree, I couldn't become a real professor, 
full professor. And I commutedf rom  New Rochelleto Yale which was 125m ilesa

you know, but I'm resentful to this country for actually wanting m y father to die.  So I 
have no respect, I think it's hypocritical, hypocritical, like no other place on earth.  And 
really, really reactionary with putting in religion,pretendingthat it's separate,butthen 

the Congressopens withprayers. Im ean, I think thehypocrisy here is what get

the most.

" N o,  you do n 't  loo k  J e wi s h , but  you  lo ok f o

A:W ell,m y youngest son read thatbookandhe knows that it wasn'tme,but it was 

close en

Q :   Re nee.
 
A: Renee, right.
 

Q:But you'venever told your kids?
 
A:No,not really, I haven't, well, I tried to tellm y daughter, but she didn't wantto hear 
it. I told you, she justdidn't want tohear it. My kids know, they know there was 

s om eth i
ng pretty terrible, because m y oldest son is definitely, he's completely anti
-
religious,Imeanhe,my daughter lives in Israel right now, she studies inIsraeland 

s he  wi ll  got to s yn a go gu e,  you kn o w, s he ha sh e ro wn ,  t he wa y s he do es re l i gi on i s 

ve r y m u c
h her own thing.  So she goes for various, but I don't know that she believes 

in God either, Imean Ikind ofdon't think so. But she enjoys some of the traditions 

and some of the rituals, but she's extrem e, extremely fem inist,obviously. Soshe 
see ks o u
t places where women get, you know, full participation. So shedoes that 
a nd sh e'sdef in i te l y act i ve , bu tI  woul dn ' t say c on tin uou s l y.  Imean , sh e' l l ha ve 
episodes orperiods where she'll goandshe'llgo topray onSabbath and she'll eat 

kosher and then
 
she'lljust throw it tothe wind. She'll comehere and she'llorder 
shrim p, you know, so it's clearly nottotally settled,but Ithink she, she's very Jewish, 

Im ean,shedoesn't look Jewish either inthesenseof, you know, thetypical Jewish 
l o ok ,  but 
she's very Jewish and she lives inIsrael, Imeanthat'sclearly...
 
Q: But you've not told her?
 
A: No,not really, not indetail,no.
 
Q :  __ ___ __ ___ .
 
A :  Hmmm?
 
Q:Is thereanything I haven'tasked youabout that you wantto say?
 
A: I don't know. I wasjust 
g o in g t o  sa y,m y yo u n g e st , m y o ld e s t  so n ,  wh o i s ve r y,  
he'sa closed person,he'snot a openperson, the othertwo are very communicative 

at least withme, they tellm eeverything.  You know,theycan callat three in the 

morning ifsom ething bothers them.
  
W e have an excellent relationship.  My oldest 
son, it'sabitmore distant. And when he was a, and he's theone whodidn't go to 

Jewish school, I mean he, he dropped out essentially, I can't remem ber, his fourth or 

f ifth grade.  He was just totally rebellious, wouldn'tdo anything in school, so we just 

had to take him  out.  The two others went straight through, 12 years of Jewish school.  
A nd  B r i an. . .
 
Q: Bar m itzvahed and all that?
 
A :  Yea h,  tha t t he y d i d, b utf o r  i ns ta nc e,  B ria n  li ve s  i n  Boul de r , I m ean 
I don't think 
he's gonetosynagogue in the three years he'sthere, you know, so it'snot very strong 

identification. But when we were in Israelduringoneofour trips withthe kids, we 

went to__________, which isthe local Holocaustmuseum ,and Jeane P
ie r re ,  wh o  
was, he m ight have been eight or nine at the time, just became hysterical, totally, 

totally hysterical.  And I had absolutely no idea that he had any feelings for this.  So, 
and we've reallynottalkeda lotabout that because he'shard totalk 
t o .  I th in k , I, m y 
youngest, Brian knows andhe just cries, youknow, so, I can't really talk tohim much, 

buthe knows.  Having readthat book. Ithink Karin just doesn't want to know, I think 

she knows, but she doesn't want to talk about it.  She doesn
' t wa n t to  talk a b o u t  it.
