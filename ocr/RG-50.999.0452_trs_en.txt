W hat you areabouttohear f rom  George is one individual's account of  the 
Holocaust. W ehave prepared a brief slidepresentation to help with 
the

roduction.
 
 
George, or Gyorgy in Hungarian, was born 
M
arch 28, 1934, in Budapest, Hungary 
to Istvanand Margit Pick.  Hungary is highlighted on thism ap of Europe in1933.
  
Istvan was 
an engineer and Margit a legal secretary.  
 

 
W eseehere Istvan and Margit with their newborn son Gyorgy.  And here we see 
Gyorgy and two cousins in a carriage in a park in Budapest in 1941. George is seated at the 

f ront of the carriage.
 
 
George attended school in Budapest.  Herewe see George on a seesaw at his

 A
ndhere isGeorge with his non
-J
ewish neighbors in 1943. 
 
 
Af ter Hungary aligned itself  with Nazi Germ any, Istvan and Margit lost their jobs due 
to new laws restricting the participation of  Jews in the economy.  Istvan was then conscripted 
into the Hungarian labor battalions.  Germ antroopsoccupied Hungary in March
 
1944, and the 
Pick fam ily was f orced to move intobuildingsm arked with the yellow star like that you see i
n 
th is p ho to.  
 
 
T ha t  f a ll,  t he  f am ily we
nt into hiding,butthe Pick fam ily was discover ed. The 
children were taken and George was placed in ahom e with 500 other children. George and 
another boy escaped and went back to their hiding place where George was reunited with his 
parents. T wo weeks later the entiref am ily wa s sentto the ghetto.  They were liberatedf rom  
the ghettoby the Soviets in January
 
1945. Inthis 1946 photographwe see George with a 
group of  survi vors, all of with whom  the Pickfam ily hadbeen inhiding.  The circle is on 

George.  
 
 
Following the war George li ved in Hungary in 1956 when he escaped andm ade his 
wa y to the UnitedStates to live with an uncle in New Jersey.  Afterworking as a laborer, 
George got a scholarship f oran intensive English language courseatT em ple University in  
Philadelphia.  He then went to work f orW estinghouseas an engineer.  George would later 
teach engineering at the Catholic University of  America here inW ashington, D.C. Af ter 
earning his Ph.D. he worked for the U.S. Navy as an aerospace engineer from 1966 to 1995,

T he second is a scholarly work about the history of  40 Jewish com munities in a particular 

region of  Hungary thathe is currently writing.

and thankyou so muchfor not only being with us on
 
F i r st  
Person
 
but being our very f irst of the year.
  
W elcome.
 
>> George Pick: T hank you.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You have so much to sharewith us. W e won'tdelay at all.
 
 
You were nearly 4 1/2when Germ any invaded
 
Poland
 
in September
 
1939 and 
W orldW ar II began. Tell us about yourf am ily and your comm unity in
 
those years leadingup 
to the war bef ore the war. 
 
>> George Pick:  Yes. I have docum ented the evidencethatm y f am ily has lived in what was 

the Hungarian E
m pi
re
 
in the last230 years. My f amily generally we re notobservant Jews.  
T hey were sim ulated. T hey were m ostly professional:  lawyers, doctors, engineers, 

businessm en. 
 
 
At the beginning of W orld W ar I, som eof  them  were in very high positions with the 
governm ent and soforth.  DuringW orldW ar I, bothm y grandparents and many of m y grand 
uncles ha
d served in the Hungarian Arm y wit h distinction. Af ter thecollapse
 
--
 
after the loss of  
that war and the collapse of  Hungary, Hungary was essentially choppedup into several pieces.  

W hat we call Hungary now is only 1/3 of the area of  what was bef ore the
 F
i rs t  W orld War.

My f am ily was spreadall over the placeof  the 
Hungarian Empire.  And once the 
treaty was enacted, they ended up in threedifferent countries
: 
 
Romania, Slovakia, and 
Hungary
,  
and som e inAustria even.  So thatwas the situation.
 
 
In  the
 
early 20s, therewas a wa ve of 
anti
-s
em it ic
 
actions by the governm entof  
Hungary.  One of the things which happenedwas in 1920, when thever y f irst anti
-J
e wi s h  la w 
was enacted in Europe
 
by the Hungarian government which was wh at was called the Numerus 
Cl
ausus
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson: T he very f irst in Europe.
 
>> George Pick:  Correct. This law essentially specif iedthat 
on l y
 
6% of  the students in the 
universities could be Jewish.  T hat 6% was the general ratioof  Jews versus Hungarians. 
 
Howe ver, in theuniversities they were over r epresented.  Over 50% of medical studentswere 
Je wish  a
nd over 35%were in engineering school. 
 
One of m y uncles was in the m edical school 
in the secondor third largest city of  Hungary.   He was physically as saulted and kicked out. 
 
He  
was not the only one. Andeventually heended up inItaly.  He was a third
-
year student.  
He  
had to
 
start all over again.  For eight years he studied inthe university and got hisdegree 
there. 
 
Many hundreds if not thousandsof  contem porary Jews had to leave Hungary in order to 
m ake aprof essional life f or them selves.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Or give up their prof ession.
 
>> George Pick:  Or give up their prof ession. My f ather was an engineer,as youm entioned.  

Af ter the Great Depression he losthis job, and
 
f or several years hewas unemployed andwe 
were on the verge of poverty.

My grandfather was achief engineer inam iddle
-
sized industrial com plex.  He got 
m y f athera job.  Unfortunately in 1938 when thef irst anti
-
Jewish laws came into power, m y 
fa the r 
lost his jobagain.  And in 1939, when the second Jewish law cam e into power, a secret 
part essentially said that people who were untrustworthy f or the uniform ed services would have 
been drafted asnon
-
uniformed slave laborers. T his,of  course, included t
he  Je ws,  som e  
comm unists and social dem ocrats.  Andm y father was inducted in the very first group in1940.  

He went to work in thenortheastern part of  Hungary where they wer e building roads
,  
wh i c h  
turned tobe strategically im portant.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And that was 1940.
 
>> George Pick:  Right.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Before we return toaf ter thewar began, you've told m e that yourf am ily was 
ver y assim ilated. In fact, we saw a picture ofyou with your 
non
-Je wish  
f riends.  
W ill y
ou say a 
little bit m ore about t
hat? 
 
>> George Pick:  Yes. Hungarian Jews in general, beginning in them id
-
19th Century, f elt ver y 
m uch welcom ed therein Hungary.  T here was a political reason why they were welcom ed 

there, inf act. The Hungarians in what they call historical Hungary were them inority, 45%, 
46%. And sothey wanted, for political reasons, tohave the Jews assim ilate so they would 
declare them selves Hungarian.  So between the Jews and the non
-J
ews, Hungarian, they 
were 51%. 
 
 
T here was another reasonfor that.  Hungary hada Feudalistic Society.  They didn't 
have a businessm iddle class. And the Jews were m ajorf actors inm aking Hungary an 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD

industrial society with m odern industry.  Andm uch of the industry, of  course, 
was
 
in Jewis h 
hands. 
 
>> Bill Benson: W hile thefull brunt of the war would not come to Hungary until 1944, clearly 
the lives of  Jews in Hungary, including in Budapest, would change significantly with the 
beginning of  the war in Septem ber
 
1939. Tell us what you can about your fam ily's lif e in the 
early year
s of  the war.  You mentioned that yourf athernow becam e
 
--
 
had to becom e part of  
the labor battalion. 
 
>> George Pick: W hen the two Jewish laws cam e into power, most of m y relatives lost their 

jobs.  So there was a real struggle, econom ic struggle.  T hat
 
was one thing. The second thing 
was that Hungary was a special case.  Although it was aligned with Nazi Germany for political 

reasonsm ostly, they were very tolerant,m oderately tolerant, of Hungarian Jews f or the reason 
thatthe Hungarian Jews had a huge stake in theeconom y and they were not replaceable. 
And it was recognizedthat whether you likedthem  ornot, they are very im portant.  Ok? 
 
 
Now, despite thefactthat m any of thesehuge com panies were lost, or nationalized 
if  you want, we had a life which we didn't think was ver y m uch
 
--
 
actually, it was a lif e which 
was indistinguishable to the previous period.
  
I went to school,f or exam ple, in1940,enrolled in 
a Jewish elementary school. And we lived, except for the struggle of money, we lived the
 
sam e way.  
 
 
Now, one of the things which happened, which we didn't know, of  course, was that 
already as early as 1942, Hitler haddem anded thatthe HungarianJewish community, whi ch 
was the second largest in Europe, 825,000people, wouldbedeported and would be 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
9
 
elim inated.  And the regent of  Hungary had refused.  Hitler at that point didnot push the point 
anym ore. 
 
 
So the situation turned out that som eof our relatives who li ved in Slovakia,f or 
exam ple, which is north of Hungary, hadalready felt the bruntof  ghettoizationand deportation.  
T hey were able to come to Hungary as refugees.  Andfor two years, between 1942 and1944, 
we successfully hid them  with falsepapers.
 
>> Bill Benson: W ere they believed when they were told what was happening in oth
e r 

countriesbut not in Hungary?
 
>> George Pick: T heHungarians, andm e personally
 
--
 
incredulous. W e didn't believe. W e 
thought it was slightl y exaggerated.  Maybe greatly exaggerated ofwhat had
 
happened to the 
Jews.  But we also thought never would it happen in Hungary.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So you're not going to experience it.
 
>> George Pick:  Exactly.
 
>> Bill Benson: W ith the lossof  jobsfor your father and your mother andothers in the 
comm unity, tell us about the 
S
t ra w
 M
an system .
 
>> George Pick:  Ok.As I said, Hungary used tobea very interesting country becausethey 

alwa ys had som e ways of doing things and som e back doors where you couldbypass the 
system .  AlthoughtheHungarian Jews couldnot work as businessmen, we had a system  
called "S
t r o hm
an" in Germ an and 
Stra w Ma n
 
in English. T he 
S t ra w Ma n
 
was sim ply a 
Christian person whowould take outa license todobusiness and couldhire a Jew as a 

worker.  T hat was allowed.  So this is what happened to m yf ather.W ehad a super in our 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
10
 
building by
 
thenam eof  Dudek.  Hetook out the license under which m y father worked.  In 
exchange, m yf ather paid a stipend to Mr.
 
Dudek f rom  1940 to 1944.
 
>> B ill B e n s o
n :  S o Mr.
 
Dudek and the other S
t ra w
 M
en, they get the jobbut then they wo uld 
basically sub it outfora whole lot lessmoney, nodoubt, toactually do the work. 
 
>> George Pick:  Right.  They didn't do work.  They were sim ply getti ng the check.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Check every m onth.
 
 
You had an incident yourself
 
--
 
as assim ilated and as thingsf elt relativel y secure 
com pared toelsewhere in Europe, you hadan incident as a youngboy early in which, I think, 

you were slappedby a m an.  W ould you tell us a littlebit about that?
 
>> George Pick:  Yes.W e lived ina house in a building of  about 20apartmen
ts.  T wo  

apartm ents were occupied by Jews.  T his was a rental. And the rest of  them were Christian.  
Andm ost of the Christians andus were onf riendly term sexcept there was a teacher
 
--
 
he 
didn't like Jews
, p
eriod.  One day he cam e hom e and I somehow got also inthe sam eplace as 
he did, andhedid not think that I was respectful enoughf orhim
 
andhe slappedm e in the 
face. I was 8 years old.  I went home and cried.
 
 
W hat happened is thism an had enough humanity in him  when he rethought of what 
he did 
t o a n 8
-
year
-
old kid who didn't really do anything againsthim
, h
e came back
; h
e cam e 
up andapologized.  T his was som ething whic h was, asf aras I wasconcerned, quite unique.  
Certainly the murderers later didn'tapologize.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You told m e things were relativel y peacef uluntil thespring of 1942and that 

lif e wasn'toutright bad.  W hatdid 
you 
m ean? And whathappened af ter the spring of 1942?  I 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
11
 
think that was during the f irst really m ajor large call
-
up of the battalions.
 
>> George Pick:  Yeah.  W ell, Hungary was a neutral country until June
 
1941 when the 
Germ ans essentially started the war against the Soviet Union. Atthat point Hungary also 
becam e 
belligerentagainst the UnitedStates, England, France.  France was not there 
anym ore.  Engla
nd and the Soviet Union. So Hitler essentially demanded that Hungary would 

f ield an Arm y, a second HungarianArm y, and would send it to theUkraine.
 
 
T he Hungarians were not regarded as particularly good soldiers. They were 
actually in the linesbehind thef ront.  At that tim e it was the large call
-
up of 50,000 Jewish m en 
between age20and 40 where they would go with the unif ormed services and do slave labor 

wo r k
; m
any of  them very dangerous work, such as getting them ines outof  the ground.
  
And 
secondl
y, thesepeople were m al
-
fedand many people who went with them as soldiers 
essentially they were sadistic.  Many of themdiedof m alnutritionand maltreatm ent.
 
 
And then in January of 1943, the Russianf rontm oved. The Germans lost their 
b a t t le in  S ta lin
grad. And the Russian f ronthad a movem ent andbroke through thedoor where 
the Hungarian Arm y was and they wiped outthe Hungarian Arm y and roughly 40,000 of these 

slave laborers also. They didn'tm ake adistinction.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So 40,000 out of about50,000 slave laborers werealso killed during the 

b a ttle.
 
>> George Pick:  Yeah
, d
uring the battle.  And many of  them  became POW s. Very few of  
t h em  c am e h om e a l ong wi t h  t h e  r e s t.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Youmentioned1943. I thinkyou also saidthat your own f irst real personal 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
12
 
experience of threatfrom  thefascists was in1943.  Share that with us.
 
>> George Pick:  Yes. 1943, summ er, was another time whenm y father was drafted.  My 
father was too old to go to Ukraine,buthe was oldenough to be still draf
t e d.
 
>> Bill Benson:  For the labor battalions.
 
>> George Pick:  For the labor battalions
, w
hich atthat time were in T ransylvania working o n 
roads. Af ter they came back, we went on a vacation, a one
-
week vacation, where we got in a 
hotel.  Nobody asked us if  we were Jewish or not.  And thenm y m other and I were walking in 
the woods, a very nice place,and then we cam eupona groupof  wide
-
eyed Nazis, Hungarian 
Nazis who were in uniform ,black unif orm. T hey are called the
 
Nila sh ,
 
ne o
-
Nazi groups. They 
w
ere com pletely sym pathetic with the Germ an. W e were not treated roughly, but we got out 
asf ast as we could.  And I didfeel,and m y motheras
,  
well, ver y threatened.  W edidn't look 
Jewish, quote/unquote, but we still could have been looked at asoutsiders and they could 
have assaulted us.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And they were what was also known as the iron cross?
 

>> George Pick:  Notthe iron cross
; t
he ironcross is diff erent. They called them  the Arrow 
Cro ss.  

>> Bill Benson: T he Arrow C ross, yes, Arrow Cro
ss.   
 
During that tim e wereyou able to continue your schooling?
 
>> George Pick:  Yes. I went toelem entary school. I was in Jewish school. And I was more 

or less lived in anormal life.  You saw the picture or you showed the picture where I had 
neighbo
rhood, little girls. T hey were ver y nic e. T hem an was an Arm y officer, but there was 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
13
 
no difference. W edidn't know who was Jewi sh, who was not. I played with them .T hey 
played with m e. And even m y f atherand he spoke very f reely.
 
 
Looking back,m y father was telling him  in 1943 thatthe Germ ans lost the war, 
which was essentially a defeatist thing andpeople could go to jailf or that.  My f ather was not 
reported.  So this was the typeof m ostof  thepeople. Som epeoplewere 
a
n ti
-s
em ites
 
and 
Na zis  in  
the sam ebuilding, but it turnedout thatour next door neighbor was not.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And,of  course, that existence as youdescribe wasn't outright bad.  Allof  that 
changed in Marchof  1944 whenthe Germ ans occupied Hungary on March 19, 1944, 70 yea
rs  
ago yesterday.
  
Once the Germ ans occupied, what was the imm ediate consequencesfor you, 
your f am ily, andother Jews in Budapest? T he Germ ans were now here.
 
>> George Pick:  Yes. The Germ ans occupied Hungary.  And Eichm ann anda small group of  
SS off ic
ers who were very, quote/unquote,experienced in Jewish affairs came in. He had 
m any sym pathizers there.  T he reg
e
nt appointed
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson: T he head of  the Hungarian governm ent?
 
>> George Pick:  Right
, t
he Hungarian governm ent.  He appointed an ext
r e m e r i gh t  
governm ent includingpeople who were Nazi s them selves.
  
W ith lightning speed, all the 
restrictive la ws which were developed inGerm any over the years and inPolandand soforth 

were applied
, n
ot inmonths or in years but in days.
 
 
S o  the f irst t
hing that happened,m y 10th birthday, on the20th of March, which was 
only nine days, we had to wear a yellow star.  T hey conf iscated telephones, autom obiles,any 
kind of transportation.They also conf iscatedany kind of com munication equipm ent. So we 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
14
 
di
dn't know what happened to people in the provinces.
 
 
My f atherand all themen between age16and 60 were, again, drawn in to the labor 
brigades.  My father was sent to the westernpart of Hungary, andhe was building 
fortif ications.  I guess by then the Germ ansf igured thateventually they would have tof ortif y at 
least theeastern or the western partof  Hungary.
 
 
W e were cutoff , which was, of course, created a lot of confusion.  Eventually in 
Juneof 1944 we had to move outof our apartm ent because there
 
was a law which cam e into 
eff ect by the27th of June to move into whatthey called starred or Jewish houses. And since, 

as Im entioned, we only had two Jews in thebuilding, the building was not qualif ied.
 
>> Bill Benson: T obea so
-
called Jewish buildi
n g.
 
>> George Pick:  Correct. And so we moved with som e relatives nearby
.  M
y grandm other's 
two sisters li ved ver y nearby.  Their apartm ent housedid qualif y.  So we moved there. The 

rule was that youhad to havefour people,four personsper room . This
 
wa s  a  two
-
room  
apartm ent so we hadeight people there. And it was ver y cro wded. W ehad to leave 

essentially our furniture and took some things with us, asm uch aswe could. 
 
 
From  thenon life becam e pretty bad.  In thebeginning of  July, to be exact, t
he 2nd 
of  July, there was a carpet bombing of Budapest with 750 bom bersand200 f ighter planes 
f rom  theAmericanalliance and30%Budapest was in ruins.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Af ter that raid. 
 
>> George Pick:  Af ter the raid, yes.  It was a four
-
hour raid. Abo
ut 30,000 people died
; o f  
course, Jews and non
-J
ews.  T he bombs didn't know where tofall. And we were lucky 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

because we hadf our bom b hits,but they wer e no closer than afew hundred yards.
 
>> Bill Benson: T akea m inute todescribe
 
--
 
you described tom e
 
what it was like after a 
four
-
hour saturationbom bing of Budapest. You're locked inthe building.  And then you go out.  
You described to me what that was like. 
 
>> George Pick: W ell, what it was like is whe n you go out and youwitness a volcanic eruption.  
T he sky was very blac k.  There were a num ber of  places which were onf ire. The sm ell ofthe 
air was terrible.  Som eoptim ists, which is one of  the things the Jews do, sometimes, thought 
thatthis was not only a bom bing raidbutthat the Am ericans already cam e.  But,of  course, 
they didn't. 
 
 
T he other thing was that during this period
 
imagine sitting in a small room  with 
m aybe 50 people andever y two, three m inutes there is ahugeexplosion very close by.  Iwas 
ver y f rightened
 a
nd f rightened enough t
hatm y m otherbroughtdown a pillow.  T his was a 
feather pillow.  She put it onm y head so thatat least the noise was m uffled. Ever since
 
--
 
not 
anym ore,butf or thenext 35 years I could not sleep without a pillow over m y head as a 
m atter
 
--
 
as an effec
t of t h e t r a um a i t se lf .  
 
 
So, of course, thepropagandablam ed the Jews.
 
>> Bill Benson:  For the bom bing.
 
>> George Pick:  For the bombing.  Yes.
  
Unbeknownst to us, between
 
May and July, 437,000 
Jews f rom the provinces were deported.  Unbeknownst to us because we had no way of  
comm unication.  Nobody knew this.  Over a hundred of m y relatives were deported.  Noneof  
t h em  c am e b a c k.

T he deportation was doneby 30,000of  the gendarm es
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  Hungarians.
 
>> George Pick:  Hungarian gendarmes, Nazi sym pathizers.  Many were extrem ely brutal.  
People were shotandpushed into
 
--
 
if  you go upstairs, you will see a sam pleof  these cattle 
cars.  80 to100 people were pushed into it. Andm ostof  them ended up in Auschwit z.  80% 

ended up inthe gas cham b
e r.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Both the scale and the speed of  whattook place as you indicated is to this 

day, tom eat least,unim aginable.  I think you described it tom e that between May
 
15 and 
J u ly
 
6, alm ost 500,000 Jews were deported. T hat was 12,000 to 14,000per day, 147 trains, 
and virtually all of them diedat Auschwitz.
 
>> George Pick:  Correct.  Yes.
 
T his was even a surprisef or the Nazis because they were not ready to take 12,000 peoplea 
day and gasthem andthen burn them.  Oneof  the crem atorium
s 
b le
w up. W hat they didwas 
they burned thebodies in big pits. Of  course,none of this was known to us. 
 
>> B ill B e n s o n :  Righ t .
 
>> George Pick:  So after the 2nd of July, actually, the 6thof  July when the Hungarian 

gendarmes were ready to start to deport the Jews f rom Budapest
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  So they had beendoing the rest of the country, andnow it's tim e to go to 

Budapest.
 
>> George Pick: T hatis correct.  Yeah.  So the only Jewish com m unity at that point in Europe 

was in Budapest
, i
n large numbers
, l
ike 165,000.

In order tofacilitate the deportation, they sent3,000 gendarmes Army up f rom the 
provinces who were, quote/unquote,experienced indoing this.  Andat the sam e time they 
wanted to have a coup against the region.  So there was one loyal, one loyal, division of the 
Arm y who cam e in and who essentially did not allow this coup tohappenalong with the 
deportations.  So f rom  July
 
6 to October
 
15 the deportation stopped.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And in part,I think you describedtom e, that thedeport
ation stopped also 
because theallies essentially said
:  W
e've just destroyed30% of Budapest; if  you continue 
deportations, we wil l pulveri ze that city.
 
>> George Pick:  Yes. That was one. TheSwedish king and several of  theothers
 
--
 
the issue 
was real
l y, I th in k,th atth e  re g
e
nt him self felt threatened personally and that's why he stopped 
it. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  I wantto be sure, George, inour remaining time
 
--
 
there's still som uch to 
cover.  You were thenm oved into a ghetto.  Iwould like you to describe to us whathappened 
f rom  thereall the way up to the siege of Budapest.
 
>> Ge o rge  P ick:  Righ t.  Ok.
 
 
So what happened isOctober 15, the regent essentially wanted toget outof  the 
wa r
.  T
o o  lit t le
;  
too late. T hat was a couple of m onthsaf ter the Romanians already did.  And 
predictably this did notwork.  Essentially in acouple of hoursthe pro Nazis took over the 
governm ent. The regent was arrested with his fam ily and taken to Austria.  Andthen the 
deportation began, the next week actually
. 
 
10,
000 wom en were taken.  And then they had 
what they called the Death March
e
s. T hey had no transportation.

18
 
>> Bill Benson:  Because of the bom bings in the war?
 
>> George Pick:  Right.  So what they did isthey raided these Jewish houses and collected 
people
 
in thebrickf actories.  Then they had 1,000, 2,000
.  T
hey started to walk them  towar d 
the westernedge of Hungary.  Andby the tim ethey got there,50% were deadby beingkilled.  

And several of m y aunts was included in this.W enever knew what happened
. 
 
Fortunately, m y father's brigade
 
was called back toBudapest inSeptem ber.  And 
one of  the things which 
was obvious, that by Novem ber,my father and hisbrigade would be 
deported. T he man who ran this group was a Christian,of  course,buthe was a very
 
sym pathetic person.  His Jewish 
f iancée
 
livedwith us.  He gave everybody 24 hours, saying:  
See youat the railroad station the next m orning.
 
>> Bill Benson:  But you're f reeto gofor the next 24 hours.
 
>> George Pick:  Exactly.  So everybody was  f ree to go. And m yf ather, of course, got the 
m essage. T hen he went to af riendof  his who was a 
n on
-Je wish  
man and told him  that he 
needs to hide som ewhere.  Heeventually endedup in a, quote/unquote,f actory which was 

cam ouf laged asaf actory f or the Arm y, actually.  He and roughly 70of  his other people who 
were able to escape deportation ended up there.  W e ended up there as well, a couple of  
weeks later.  He sentus a message to com e. Andthen we went, and we hid therefor two or 
three weeks. Then they 
f ound us out.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Before you tell usabout that,just tom ake sure everybody understands,the 

hiding place was actually
 
--
 
to theoutside world and to the Nazis, it was a factory producing 
unif orm sf or theGerman Arm y, but, inf act, itwas a hiding place.
 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
19
 
>> George Pick:  Hungarian Arm y.  It was a hiding placefor Jews.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Ahiding placefor Jews
, i
ncluding dressing as guards.
 
>> George Pick:  Right.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And now you and your m other are hidden thereaswell.
 
>> George 
P ic k :   Righ t .
 
>> Bill Benson:  It'sextraordinary to even im agine that. 
 
>> George Pick:  Andnot only that, but therewere f ourplaces like this.  It was anextraordinary 
organization of  Zionists, Comm unists,and other sym patheticpeople who were trying to save 
roughly 1,200,1,300people.  Im agine, you have tof eedthem also. So it's logistic
a lly
 
a 
problem , too.  But they did it very well until they were betrayed. And then they were betrayed.  

W ethought that we were finished. There was a Hungarian Gestapo.  And aGestapo group 
cam e in andthey saidwe knew that you were Jewish.  T hey sortedthe men and the wom en, 
children.
  
Fortunate enough, there were anum berof  Jews.  T his was in Decem ber
,  vi
rtually at 
theend of the war.  Anumberof  Jews who had a
 
lot of  m oney and they were able to bribe 
t h em .
  
 
 
Af ter that
, 
the group who ran this organization decidedthat the 22 children who 
were hiding, including m yself , wouldbebetter off  if  they were takento an orphanage which 
was under the protection, quote/unquote, of the Swiss Red Cross. And22of  us, I was one of  
theolder ones, and afriend of m ine andI decided to escape. W eescaped and went back to 
the hiding place. 
 
T hiswas a ver y dangerousthing because we hadto go through the whole 
city, of  course.W e couldn'tdisclose that we were Jewish.  There were patrols running around.  

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
20
 
So eventually after a couple of hours we gotback.
 
 
Af ter the war, Ifound out thataboutfour,f ivedays af ter our escape,all the children 
were taken to the Danubeand they were shot.
 
>> Bill Benson: T here was about500 of them. 
 
>> George Pick:  500. 
 
Andthen toward theend of Decem ber, the Hungarian Gestapo said 
thatthe ghetto, which was established attheendof  the Novem ber
,  
would be amuch saf er 
place for us because
 
som e of the Nazis started to think that this was a Jewish hiding place and 
they would come andno questions askedthey would shoot us.
 
 
So they senta coupleof  police.  Police
 
--
 
they were not pro Nazis.  And they toldus 
thatthey would betaking us tothe ghetto
; t
hey would be inf ront
, f
ollow them . And that's it.
 
Sof rom  170, 65 totheghetto.T he rest of them  evaporated.  You saw a group of thosepeople 
who survi ved both in the ghetto and outof  the ghetto.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So atthe endof  the warf or you,notthe end of thewar in April, you f ind 

yourself  with your parents living in an exceptionally constricted environment, and then the 
Russians begin toarrive.  T ell us about that tim e.
 
>> George Pick:  Ok.W egotto the ghetto just afew days bef ore Christm as
o
f  1944.  
Essentially, we were housed in a building whi ch had several hundred oldpeoplef rom the old 
age hom es, the Jewish old agehom es.  And35 of us got one room
, n
othing in them.
  
So we 
lived there only a few days because by Christm asd

scalesiege of  Budapest begun

which m eant that24/7
 
heavy artiller y and bom bing raidsand soforth.
  
T his was an

old, buildings, in the basement,they didn't have any concrete. It was just sand. Sothe thing 
we did is we had a latrine inthe m iddleof  it,because we need that.W ehad no electricity, no 
water, and no food. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  And just toadd, it was alsoan extraordinarily brutalwinter ou
tside.
 
>> George Pick:  It was an extraordinarily brutal winter. W e were sitting
 
in
,  
mo st of the  time , in  
totaldarkness. T he problem  was food was available, butbecause the streets were terribly 
dangerous to walk, very few people were volunteering to bring the rest of usf ood.  A couple of  
us did, and they got seriously hurt.  One got killed. 
  
So what was happening at thatpoint was 
slow star vation. Eventually we got, of  course, lice.  It was ahopeless situation. 
 
 
An SS guy, in beginning of  January, cam e inwho was actually Hungarian.  He said, 
you know, don'tthinkfor a minute that you will survi ve this
; w
e will b low up the ghettobefore 
the Soviets arrive.  And there were other plans to kill actually m ass killings of  70,000 Jews  who 

were at that time inthis ghetto conditions. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  In pretty m uch exactly the sam e circum stances youwere in.
 
>> George Pick:  Yeah
, i
n a very sm all area. It was alm ost unbearable. 
  
But it didn't happen 
on the18th of January.  W e got liberated. W e foundout, num ber one, thatmany people, 

particularly the old people, died already.  I would say half of our building died in thesefew 
weeks when I was there.
  
W hen there was a lull in thef ighting, we took thesebodies out. They 
had3,000or more bodies, all thrown on the top of each other in them iddle of a square, which 

was ri ght inf ront of our building.  Andthese people eventually were buriednext to them ain 
synagogue f rom  Budapest.

>> Bill Benson:  During that time yourf ather,who was with you, he tried
 
to serve as sort ofa 
policemantom aintain som e kindof order.  His job was toprotect allof  you.  He had a night 
st ick.   
>> George Pick:  Yes. My f ather volunteeredas apolice. Thepolice therehad onem ission

to protectthe Jews.  He got the night
 
stick, apieceof  cloth which says that he was a Jewis h

Hungarian, Germ an, and Russian.  He lost 
two of his partners becausethey were patrolling the streetsand what they were supposed to 

do ism ake surethat the 
N

could not have been done.  A num ber of  buildings were penetrated by them  and m assacred in 

the basem ent. 
 
T he other reason was that he got doubleportionsf or food, andhebrou

>> Bill Benson: T ell us about liberation.
 
>> George Pick: W ell, liberation was a very a nticlim acticevent. W eknew that something

appenedbecausethe noise, which was assaulting us 24/7, ceased. W e looked up,and we 
sa w 
--
 
we had a little window up quitehigh. W elooked up. W e couldn't seepeople.W eonly 
could seefootwear. W e knew what the Nazi footwear was. W edidn't recognize that. W e 
f iguredout that thatmust have been the Russians.  And, indeed, we sort of littleby little went 
out,opened the door,and the Russians were there.
 
 
T here were no celebrations.  Most of us justwanted to get out of there.  W e were 
ve r y wo r ri e
d that the Germ ans would com eback.  Som y f atherand m y m other andI decided 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

23
 
about noon time of that day to start walking back. T he city was indescribable. W e were 
walkin g through bodies of dead menand dead horses, buildings wer e collapsing as we wer e 
walkin g.  It took us a couple of hoursto goback to where we camefrom  in June when we lived 
for ourself.  And Mr.
 
Dudek was there.
 
>> Bill Benson: T he building's superintendent was still there?
 
>> G e o
rge Pick:  He was there.  He was theonly person who was very happy to see us. Most 
of  the Nazis were rather white as a sheet becausethey thought that now it's payback tim e. W e 

hadno intentionof doing anything like that. You couldhave easily pointed out somebody and 
said, Nazi, and a Russian would pull a gunand shoothim . W e didn't do that. W e were just 
tired and exhausted. 
 
 
My grandm other andother grandparents came back alsoonthe sam eday. T he 
siege of  Budapest did notend. T his was the18th of  January.  It went on f or another
 
--
 
almost 
a month until the 13thof  February when it could be liberated.  Evenaf ter that, there were som e 

scares that the Germans would have som e offenses and com e back.  So we li ved in a scary 
situation until roughly April.

>> G

loss and devastation? 
 
>> George Pick: W ell, m y father
,  
I guess
,  
was anunrealistically optim istic person inhindsight, 
because he thought Hungary was going to become a dem ocracy and there wouldbe,again,

opportunitiesf or business.  He was abusinessm an.  He was hoping that things would go back.  
 
A lot of people were not optim istic. They were  people who were right.  Som
e of t h em  ca m e  
backfor nobody in the fam ily, and so they just turned around and went back to the D.P. 
cam ps.  30,000 Hungarian Jews in there.  
 
 
W e were am ong theones who stayedbehind.  Of  course, I was only 11 years old.  I 
couldn't makeupm y own plans.  I started high school. T hat tim e high school was eight 
classes.  It was a Jewish high school. I graduated in1952. By then it was a Com muniststate, 
of  course. And a lot of peoplefelt that somebody graduatedf rom  aJewish high school could 
never m ake it to the university.  But, again, acritical history, the Com munist government 
wanted to show that, no, they are not discrim inating andm y class of  13, of  among the people, 
boys, 12of  us, we wer e accepted. I was accepted inthe technicaluniversity in Budapest.  I 
graduated justbefore the 56th revolution. I was involved in the revolution.  I'm  not going to 
describe what I did.  But I saw in Novem ber that that was over, andso I andafew friendshad 
taken a very dangerous road butmanaged to get ou
t of t h e c o un try.
 
>> Bill Benson:  I thinkall of  us would love toknow when your autobiography is actually 

published.  The
 
escapef rom  Hungary, from the Comm unists in 1956, that's a whole otherstory 
unto itself .
 
 
I do wanttoask you acouple more things
 
before we close, George.  Oneof  them  is 
that in light of all that you've described, we lookedat your photographs
, t
ell ushow your 
photographs
 
su r vi ve d .  
 
>> George Pick:  Yeah, well, that's a story wh ich m y m other couldtell you more about.  My 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
25
 
m other always f eltthat photographs werem ore valuable than diam onds. Wedidn't have too 
m any diam onds.W e had
 
a little suitcase, which is now
 
property of them useum, and that 
suitcasehad essentially all thef am ily photographs.  Some of which you saw here.  Bec
ause 
shefelt that that could notbe replaced
, e
verything else could.  So we wentf rom  one place
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  Carryi ng the suitcase with the photos.
 
>> George Pick:  Right.  I was the only one who was strong enoughphysically when we we nt 
f rom  the ghetto toback hom e to carry that suitcase. That suitcase, Idon'tthink, weighed more 
than two pounds
, m
aybe less.  My f atherand my m other were 
s
kin and bones. 
  
So that's how 
we had the photographs.  Many of  them  ended up here in the collection.
 
>> B i l l
 
Benson:  My last questionfor you, George.  As we noted earlier, yesterday was the70th 
A
nniversary of  the Germ an invasion of Hungary, bringin g thef ull brunt of the Holocaustto 
Hungary.  I know you have som e thoughts you'd like to share with us with respect to events 
that were plannedby the Hungarian government to comm em orate the tragedy. 
 
>> George Pick: W ell, I don'thave much time, soI just would liketo say that 40 years ago a 

rightist go vernm ent was voted in with absolute majority into the parliam ent in Hungary.  And 
thef irstthing they did is they changed the Constitution. And one of thef irst parts of the 
constitution said thatbetween March 19 of 1944,betweenthat date,specif ic date, and 1990, 
Hungary was not an independent country.  It lost its sovereignty.
  
W hat itm eant is that the 
Hungarians would not take any responsibility for theatrocities of theHolocaust.  
 
 
T his is what they essentially are doing. T hey have a comm em oration of the 70th 
A
nniversary, which wa s very well
-
planned.  Th
ey were going to have an institute. They were 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
26
 
going to have several things.  But they were tr ying to essentially whit ewash the region and they 
tried to say that it was all theGermans who did it. And the Hungarians, Jews all over the world 
but particular
ly in Hungary, m aybe 40,000, they were com pletely upset. They essentially 
boycotted all these com memorative years. They decided to boycott it.  And this has had som e 

international consequences. But the Hungarian governm ent is not
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson: T hey're unyielding.
 
>> George Pick: T hey are not yielding.  SoIwanted to let you know that Hungary right now, 
andI andm any otherhistoriansas well as non
-
historians
,  
are very pessim isticabout what 
Hungary's f uture is right now.  T here is a neo
-
Nazi party.  And some people say that itfeels 
like 1938, 1940 again.  It's quite sad,of  course,f orm e asa survivor that we see history repeat 
it s e lf .   Hop ef u lly it  wo n ' t
,  
but we are pessim istic.
 
>> Bill Benson: We won't have timef or questions of George today.  As you can see, we could 

have spent the rest of  the afternoon.  After we f inish, George is available to greet you if  yo
u 
wish.  If  youhave a question
 
you would liketo askhim ,George will be there

George?
 
>> George Pick:  Yes.W ell, I think I hadm y last words.  Up until now, the Jewish comm unity 

was passive in Hungary.  I alwa ys said that what we need in the world is tolerance. I think 
tolerance itself  isnot enough. 
P a s s ivit y
 
is not enough.  I think we have to beall proactive and 
f ight against racial discrim ination, f ight against 
xeno
phobia, andf ight against 
an t i
-S
em it is m
.  
 
 
So I would like you 
to  t
hink about this.  It is not enough to understand.  It now hasto 
be an active f ight.
  
Unfortunately the Holocaust was
 
not the last genocide in the 20th,even 
21st century. W e have genocidesagain. Sowe reall y needproactive people who recognize 
and do something. 
 
 
T hank you very m uchfor com ing.  That's m y last word.
