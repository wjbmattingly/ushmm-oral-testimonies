Why don't we start with your arrival in Westerbork and a-- 

 

Westerbork?  

 

Yeah, and then going on the train to Sobibór. 

 

(Clears throat)  I came from um, 
Fircht (? ), from the concentration camp, Fircht, I came to 
We sterbork in 194...2, 43, and, uh, uh, when I came there, I found an uncle and my mother was 

there with the five children, and we came together w
ith these girls that I met, we stayed together 
with them, and, and a whole bunch of uh, Dutch girls, 
we stayed always very close together.  Also, 
when we were in Fircht, in a concentration camp. 
 So we came  in We sterbork, and we were in an 
uh, barrack, in an, uh only people were, were, were 
punished and they were hidden.  In Holland, or 
some thing this, uh, this way.  So we, we, had no chan
ce to get out, and my uncle tried to get us out, 
and We sterbork was a very safe camp.  I mean you 
could stay there, it was very good and uh, very 
good accommodations and everything.  So we, we uh, we were there 8 days, 7 of 8 days, and uh, 

then we had to go on a transport to, we didn't know
 where we went, we had 
to go to Fircht, it was 
the first transport that was with uh freight wagons
, and, we went with 60 people in a freight wagon, 
and also this uncle what had 5 children, 5 little boys, he
 went together also in that um, in the train. 
I didn't see it, my, I later I found pape
rs in Sobibór, that he went with this train, with this transport. 
And we went in, and the, it was very uh, organi
zed done in Westerbork, they did everything very 
organized, and when we were in the uh, train, 
there was uh with all the people and younger people 
together, and, uh, there was one bottle in the mi ddle 
and I think that, and that was the bathroom.  I 

don't think that, that uh, we, uh, had uh, a way to sl
eep, we had to sit on th
e floor, and we went 3 
days and 3 nights to Sobibór, 
uh, when we stopped some times the train, and every freight wagon 
has a little window on top, and everybody tried to l
ook through it, so when you had chance to look 

through it, and you saw people was, was standing like,
 and they did like that, and we thought they 
were just an-anti-Jews, and they know we, we Jews 
they didn't like us, but we had no idea that they 
told us that we go to our deat
h.  And, every time when the train stopped, the Germans start shooting 
on top of the train, and with, with dogs around us
, and it was very panicky, and, uh, it was very 
scary, and we hope, you know, we, we gi
rls, we really stuck together, and we helped each other to 
stay a little bit in good mood.  After 3 days and 3 
nights, we thought we were in Russia, everybody 

 
 
looked so poor, and, uh, we had no idea where we we
re, and then we come  on and we see the big 
sign, Sobibór, and when we came in, everythinglooks very nice, little windows and flowers and, 
and uh the house were painted green and red, and, it,
 it looks very nice, and when they open the 
doors, these big doors that we had to go out in, start screaming and hitting with the whips, and uh, 

we had to go out and out, all, all the people, 
and there was a little trolley, a little wagon what uh, 
the coal mi ners use that goes, you can uh, uh rip 
it open that people can easy go out, so all the 
people that couldn't walk, they showed them in th
ere, and all the children what got lost fr om the 
parents, they had to go in the trolley, and this tro
lley went straight to the gas chamber.  That was a 
special line that went there, and we had to throw away our little suitcases what everybody took with 

them, the most important things were in there, and we had to throw away our suitcases, and I 

reme mber vividly that one woma n throwed away al
so an, by accident, her child fell, and she said, 
"Oh, my baby!"  And, a German say, and he hit her w
ith a whip, and he said, "I will take care of 
this baby!"  And, so we walked farther, and all 
the Germans were standing there on the side, all the 
SS was, they were always watching all of us wh
en we passing, and so we stayed together with 

these young girls, and we were a bunch, I don't remember the amount, and they took us out, and 

they say, "Stay on the side."  And all the other 
people went forward, one we
nt right, and one went 
left, and we saw everybody going, we
 saw the woma n going to the gas chamber, walking already, 
and a man was standing on the side, that's what I 
reme mber, and they spoke to them that uh, uh, we 
hear them speaking the German that they say, 
"Here's a card, and now you can write home, that 

everything is fine here, and now you going to have
 to take a shower, and we will take care, good 

care of you..." that we hear that he 
was talking to them.  And then, he took us girls, and we went to 
Camp One.  Sobibór was divided into 3 camps, 
one camp, 3 was the gas chamber, Camp 2 was the 
working camp, and Camp 1 was the camp where we 
slept and also where the little uh, place, little 
barracks, or little houses together with the buildings, and there were the tailor and the gold ma-

ma ker, and the uh, different people 
were sitting down and worked in these places and also we slept 
there, the ma n and the woma n slept there, and when I came on, I saw some people from my 

hometown.  One boy was, especially his parents were
 my parents' best friends.  And I say, "Hi! 
How are? !" and uh, they didn't even look at me , and 
they were afraid to say anything, and was sort 
of strange, they have to recognize me .  They we
re all married, uh, men, they were in their 20s, 25, 

26, and their wives went already, of course, to th
e gas chamber.  So, when they went away, and 
then, we went too, uh, Camp 2, and we had to sort
 the clothes, and I didn't know what I was doing. 
We had to sort the clothes for the people that went
 to the gas chamber.  And, uh, that what was we 
were working.  First quality, second quality, and 
the third quality, and uh, we, uh, in the evening, 
then, 5 o™clock was the appel, and the roll call, a
nd then we had to go and 
went to camp One, and 
that same evening the, the Jew, we had to dance.
  There were some Jewish what came there, and 
they had some instrument, uh, the violin I th
ink, remember, I don't remember exactly what 

 
 
instrument it were, and they had to play the music and we had to dance, and Chaim asked me to 
dance.  This is the first time that I met Chaim. 
 And after that we dance
d, I, I saw these boys, and 
they told, and we had to dance when the fire
 was already burning and, and you could smell them 
here, and, and, and the bone, and, and it really li
ghted up the whole sky from that they were 
burning the bodies from the transport what we 
came with.  I, I don't re
me mber with how ma ny 
people I came, I think it was 1500 pe
ople, and in, in 3 or 4 hours they could kill all these people 
from every transport.  So after that we, that was ju
st a sadism from the, from the SS's that we had to 
dance, and the fire was burning, 
and we didn't know anything what was going on and they enjoyed 
that, just, we know, how difficult  it was for the people 
that were alone there, that they had to , they 
insisted they had to ask us.  So after the dancing, 
I went to the barrack, where, there where we slept, 
and I saw these boys, and they told me  what was 
going on.  They told me that the fire was uh, all 

the people that were uh, went to the gas chamber, a
nd they told me that, and that they were burning 

them there.  And, I couldn't believe it.  I, I think I,
 I didn't, it didn't, I couldn't believe it, and I think 
it took me a long, long time that I was alive and ever
y time when I come, came in transport, that I 
saw people uh, that I, it was something just that uh, I 
couldn't believe it, and I, I, it took me really a 
long time to realize what was, that it was true, a
nd, and, and that all the people what, what we saw 
passing by with the little window where we were assor
ting our clothes, that uh, half hour later they 
would all be dead.  So, I, I,  th
ey told me that they came with their wives, and uh, that their wives 
all went also to the gas chamber.  When we were
, a, a week, or two weeks in camp, there were 72 
Dutch me n, and there was one German, what was a tra
itor.  He went to the German and told things, 
and he told sometimes things what was not even true
.  And he went to one of the SS, was one of the 
Germans, and told them that the 72 Dutch boys want to run away.  And we, of course, never found 

out if it was true, but we didn't believe 
it because nobody, everybody knows that uh, for a Dutch 
man to run away in Poland, so antisemitic, that 
there was no chance that he could stay alive 

anyway.  So, the 72 boys, they took them aw--they had to um uh, stay on roll call, and uh, they took 

them away and they shot them all.  That was the 
fi rst thing what I saw that they, we didn't see it, 
but we heard the shooting.  Uh, after this, uh, we, 
we went every day to work, and the most work 
what we did was assorting clothes, and 

 

Beep. 

 

(Clears throat) Uh, when we came 
out, the, uh, the people had, they didn't know that we went to the 
con, that that we were, there was a gas chambe
r, nobody, from Dutch people we had no idea where 
we went.  I thought I go to my mother and my brot
her's.  Well, my brother and my mother were 
already sent to Poland, and I had chance when 
I was in Holland, to get 
away.  Out of that 
concentration camp where I was in Holland.  I didn't 
want to go away really.  I was the youngest of 

 
 
4 children, and I, I want to go to my mother, a
nd my mother was already sent to Poland and my 
brothers too.  So when I went in Poland, and this
 uncle in, in Westerbork, 
where we were, we me t 
in Westerbork, he say that he can get me out, and, from the beginning when I was there, and I say, I 
really don't want to go out when I want to go to
 my brother and my mother. In Pol--I don't know 
where they were, I thought they were in a big camp where all the people from Holland went to.  So, 

um, when I went to, in, in, the, in
 the train, and they, the transporters there, we all thought we went 
to a camp and we had no idea that there was such a 
thing as a gas chamber or a concentration camp 
or a, perhaps a concentration camp, but a, but a 
camp where we all would work, and then we also, 
all families together, and, uh, was a little bit childish 
perhaps, but that's the way we saw it, we, we 
had no idea.  But, in Holland, first of all, the Germans took, took the people away, and took them, 

and sent them away to Westerbork, and later to Po
land, but they were not so harsh to them, that 
they were in Poland.  In Poland there were much harsher things what they did, with, to Jews.  So, 

when we went on a transport, all of us girls, 
and all of the people thought we go to Poland.  When 
we came out in Sobibór, when they give us this, 
give the people the card to write home, the people 
wrote home because they thought that it will be 
okay, when they thought they will uh, go, take a 
bath and take a shower and not what the Germans 
told them that they have to take a shower 
because there is a, a typhus is growing out of th
e, is a sickness, and they, they, uh, really thought 
they take a shower and go to the family, and go a
nd work there.  Because I say, myself, that the 
men run to the shower, it was a hot day 
in the camp,--------------------, and 
they say, "Come boys, 
come boys!  We'r e going to take a shower!"  They 
were Dutch people.  "Come, we'r e going to take 
a shower!"  And they run to the 
gas chamber, and, and they were already had all the clothes off, 
and they were nude and I saw them running to the uh 
showers.  So, I, and I remember also vividly 
now that I was already a, a month or so in camp, 
and they give us cards that we should write home 
that we are in, in a camp, but we'r e doing we
ll, and, and, and nobody wrote back home from the 
Dutch people because they know that um, in Holland 
they would think that it is okay to come to 

Poland, and not to try to hide or do some thing a
bout it.  And, when the Dutch transport ca-came, 
everything was more organized.  Wha-what everything with the Jew, well the Dutch people walked 

to the gas chamber.  They had no idea that it was 
what they went to.  And every time when there 
came a Dutch, Dutch transport, they walked just, and did exactly what the Germans, sometimes 

even they took their hat off.  Once came a whole 
transport with children--500 children, was in one 
transport, and it came from Holland, there was a Du
tch transport, and all little children, they came 
from a home???  I didn't see it, they, they locked us up in a, in an, in our first, in the first camp 

where we slept.  Things like that they didn't let 
us see.  When the polish transports came, was a, 
they, a lot of Polish they didn't want to go to th
e gas chamber, and that was many times that they 
shot them, and there was shooting and screaming 
before, before we, uh, did anything, the assorting 
the clothes.  Well, they let us, not, especia
lly the Dutch people.  The -------------, like my husband 

 
 
had sometimes to work and take the bodies out of 
the trains, but, uh, they don't let us see it, they, 
they locked us up in the ca--often when ther
e was some thing going on like that we were not 
allowed to see it.  The Polish Jews knows what 
is going on.  Uh, I remember once there came a 
whole transport from Belgitz, and they made an
 uprising, and, uh, and I remember that uh, when 
we had to assort the clothes, everything was 
filled with blood, and they locked us up, and we 
thought now we will die of course too because they 
locked us up and we were, were not allowed to 
to go out of our barrack where we slept, and uh, 
the, the, we have shooting and screaming, and it 
was unbelievable, and later we had to sort the cl
othes, it was full with blood, and, and uh then also 
in the one of the pants, my husband found in 
Yiddish written, "Take revenge," the comment, in 
Jewish, "Take revenge."  Uh, because, uh, we tried to
 run away and he told in, in uh Yiddish in uh, 
inside of his pocket we found that 
writing what I remember.  It, it was, it was, hell, but, for me, I, I 
was, I, I, I me t Chaim from the beginning, and we 
fell in love, and I think that softened our both 
lives, what I really think, that, that we closed our
selves a little bit off from really what was, what 
the horror things, what we didn't don't want to s
ee.  It, I remember like the Dutch people, they 
came, many times they came, and they found out that
 the wives went to the gas chamber, and they 
laid down and they died in a week, and also th
e Dutch people, when you want to eat some thing, 
they were so hungry.   See, we worked with the cl
othes, assorting.  And we assorted the clothes and 
what we could steal from them, for, what the Ge
rmans wouldn't get, we stole also food, and we had 
a little bunch of girls that we lived together wit
h.  It was one girl what
 was my buddy, Oola, Oola 
Stan, she also survived after the, the camp, and I ----- 
had a cousin there, what I met, and we shared 
always the food, and I was very, I 
was never afraid, and I remember, it was really heavy.  I put all 
between my bra and in my uh, underpants food and, a
nd took it with me to where we slept, and we 

shared it them with these girls.  So, we were not
 that hungry when there came a transport.  When 
there didn't come a transport we were very hungr
y.  Sometimes we hided under our pillow, and the 
mou-mouse and the rats eat it up many times a
nd found some  whole nest under my pillow from 
these little mouse.  But, uh, we, we were not that
 hungry as the people that worked in the woods, 
and then we had to eat sometimes and they just
 didn't let us eat, and sometimes we were hungry, 
Chaim always say, "You have to finish the soup," wh
ich was just water, we give it away to them 

because they were much more hungry than we, but th
ey got, the people what didn't work in the, in 
the, uh, assorting clothes, they died very quickl
y, especially the Dutch people, and, the intellec-the 
bo-boys that came straight from the university, when they came to the camp, somehow they get 

sick and died in a very short time.  I remember
 one boy, he came from a very rich family from 
Rotterdam, the, ah had a very big uh, business in 
spices, they did business with Indonesia, and his 
wife went to the gas chamber, and this boy, I reme
mber, died in, in, in, in a week, just that he 
couldn't, that, all what he saw what was going on. 
 Also once, and I got also later on typhus, and 
when you have typhus, uh, you don't reme mber mu
ch, you know, like you have very high fever, 

 
 
and, and you don't reme mber much what is goi
ng around you.  In that time, Chaim and my 
girlfriend was -------, they, they took care of it, ev
en, you couldn't be sick in Sobibór.  When you 
were sick, you got shot.  When I reme mber, when
 I had typhus, one day, I was home, and, one of 
the SSs came, and he say to all the men, "Out! Raus
! Raus!" and hit them with a whip, and all those 
sick people they were standing outside, and had 
to go out, and they were standing outside, and I 
remember boys from the Zionist Organization I 
belonged to whatever, camping with when I was 
young, I was young at that time too, it was 80,90, and I wa
s sort of standing there, and, and all in 
the underpants, and they looked so terrible, and 
I came out, and he say to me , "You go to work!" 
And I went to work, and they took 
them away and they all shot them, all these boys they shot, and I 
was just lucky, it was just like a lucky star a
bove me.  Every time uh, something really, I thought 
'now I'm going,' and...I, they didn't shoot me , I went 
back to work.  Chaim took care of me  when I 
was had typhus.  I remember I couldn't eat a
nd he brought me  food, and, and um, I couldn't go 
walk, and he brought down into the bathroom, there was a bathroom, it was a little hole in the 
ground, and, so, it, it, but, see because we were toge
ther, Chaim and I, we, we held, we were not 

insane, and, and, I, I think that saved us a lot that
 we could, could just uh, be more than people what 

were alone.  And it was, it was just, all these wh
at going on, it was just, it was just a dream, it was 
like, like you live in a dream.  I remember a Dutch man came where we slept. 

 

We have to reload. 

 

How do you know?  

 

Beep. 

 

Correction, this is SR-2, but CR-3 is up, Sync take 3 is up. 

 

Beep. 

 

First I want you to, whatever you were going to tell me, it started "A Dutch man--." 

 

We ll, I reme mber, one day, in uh, uh, a Dutch ma n came  to, the camp, uh 2, where we slept, no 

Camp 3 where we slept, and 

 

Start again, Camp 1 where you slept. 

 

One, one. Uh, a Dutchman, see we'r e out of the, a Dutch ma n came, and he walked in, and uh, Fre-

 
 
Wa gner was standing there in the camp, and he wa
s one of the worst SS's what you can have, and 
he say, "What you doing here?   And he took an an
 shovel, and, and, he hit him on his head, and 
just, his head fell in 2 pieces.  It was just unbelieva
ble.  The, the crime!  What was going on!  It's 
just, I can't , I can't  believe...I, I don't, I remem- , I don't remember everything because we, we didn't 

want to remember everything.  But many times the 
Germans, they hit, we, the, the Dutch people, 
the Dutch people, they had for the punishment, th
ey had to run around, to-the whole day, and they 

were never allowed to stay quiet.  So, so long 
they had to run for punishment, and work, till they 
dropped dead.  And that was some thing what they 
invented.  All the time they invented something 
new--the German, and most they had it against 
the Dutch, what I remember, and...to, against the 
Dutch me n.  Uh, some how, uh, a woma n, they didn't 
punish so much, some how, they had a softer 
heart for--once I got hit with an, uh, with a whi
p.  I remember one, one 
in uh, uh, uh, a Jew did it, 
and a Kapo.  A Jewish Kapo hit me . I, I say, uh, wa
s in the camp where we slept, in Camp 1, we 
slept, and he say, uh, I say, "Oh, the, the Kapos, 
they show off, and go to the guy--" so I was 
screaming, and he heard it, and he came out and he 
hit me with a whip over my shoulders.   I think 

it still hurts me know.  So painful was that it, it can
--and once after that I had, a, uh, but most of the 
time they didn't do anything to woman.  But the 
men were all the time they uh got punished, the 
Dutch people, they got more punished, and, uh, it was unbelievable to see how the uh, uh, uh, 

really suffered. 

 

Why did he punish you?   What had you done?  

 

I was saying some thing um, uh, bad words what is a 
international, an international, and I didn't 
know that he is a, a Pole, a Jewish Pole, our Ka
po, that he understood it, and so I say a very bad 
word, and, and he came and he hit me.  I say it about
 it, and then, he hit me with the whip.  Also 
once, I, I, some body, and we had to work always 
in the woods, and once a k-an uh, SS, hit me , and 
we, we didn't wear much clothes, uh, regular clothe
s, because the clothes from the people that went 
to the gas chamber, we, every day we, we took some
thing else out and we wore.  We  didn't, wear 
uh, uh, uh clothes from people that we
re in like, in, in Auschwitz.  We wore regular clothes.  So, 
very, we wore very thin clothes, and when th
ey hit you, you have nothing under it, it's very, very 
painful, --------the whip.  And, I, I, I was planni
ng to run away, and then I remember, there's 

nowhere to run.  And, uh, w-we had to walk uh 
when didn't came a transport, we were, uh, -------, 

we were also very happy many times when ther
e came a transport because we know when there 
wouldn't come transport that we go to, we, we will 
be dead, they will shoot 
us  when there wouldn't 
transports come  to Sobibór anymore.  And we 
know that that transport is going to, to the gas 

chambers, to, to, concentration camps, so every w
eek when there didn't came transports, we were 

worried.  And they let us do work, like cleani
ng a woods, the woods, big woods, where there are 

 
 
from ---------------, and we had  to clean that.  And they
 looked for work for us, or we had to uh, cut 
down trees, and uh, and we had to bring them uh, uh he
avy tree from one place to
 the other.  Or we 
have to fill up these trolleys with sand, and 
we had to uh, push away a bunch of ----------- when we 
had to work, that very, that, that kind of a wor
k, in the woods, we had to work.  So, when there 
came a transport we know we had food, and we had, and we had clothes, 
and we know we stay 
alive  because we had work.  When there came 
no transport on the end, when there didn't came any 
transports anymore, we know that's the end of our
 um, of our, that will be the end, we didn't know 
what was going on, we thought there wou-wou-won'
t be any work camp, but we, that was very 
scary, so, so, when, we were always, it is unbelieva
ble to think this way, but we were happy when 
there came a transport and, b-because the trans
port came anyway, and the Polish transport was 
much harder to handle than the Dutch transports when they ------------. 
 

Tell me  about your work and also how you could sa botage in your work, what acts of sabotage...?  

 

Yeah, well, we had to assort the clothes, and right away when I came, some how Chaim worked on 

the same table, and we had to assort the clothes of first quality, second quality and I know 

everything went to Germany, and I tr
y, every piece that I saw, I tried t-to tear it apart, the clothes, 

and I thought that was the only thing that I coul
d do of sabotage.  And also when I found money 

and jewelry, I didn't give it to the Germans, I give 
to Chaim.  I laid it on the table in a corner, and 
Chaim took it most of the time--well Chaim had a 
friend that worked where the fire m- me n, and 
they, they burned all the papers, so the man knows 
that we have to look always on the bottom of 
there was some money there, and he put it in 
the ground, for, and, and hide it in the ground.  So, 
when, when the, the, I didn't even think for what th
ey did it. I did, I didn't ev
en think that we ever 
use it for ourselves.  I was just thinking, only 
thinking what I thought, how can we do eh, on the 
sabotage against the Germans.  And it was very da
ngerous when the Germans would see it that we 
do that, uh, you get shot because when you, the same  
thing, I, I took always 
food with me  to the 

camp where we slept.  And when the Germans, uh, s
ee, saw that I would do that, they just shot you 
because once a boy opened a can sardines, and I rememb
er so well, we had all to stand all out of, 
everybody has to come  to a big whole-uh, area, and we
 had to stay there, and the, and the boy lay 
on the piece of wood, and 2 me n had 
to carry him and he was half dead.  Uh, just was full with 
blood, and his arm, it was just unbelievable, and 
he say, "When everybody ever open a sardine or 
anything again for food, that will ha
ppen to you," and later he, he shoot him, shot him.  And, so, it 
was very, very dangerous.  I remember once, 
uh, there were a bunch, there were uh, people what 
worked in the woods with the Germans, and some
 killed some  Germans in the woods, and they run 
away.  When the, when the Dutch people, they di
dn't know where to run to, and they were standing 
there, and they brought the Dutch me n, they brought 
to us also, we had to
 stand on a big tre-uh, uh 

 
 
place, and, I had a lot of food with me , in, in, in a 
coat, I remember, in a coat, and one of the girls 
was crying, and her husband was wit
h, with one that was standing there, and I know the German 
wouldn't ask her, and I say, "Will you hold my co
at because I know when they, uh, uh looking over 
what I have with me, they will shoot me right 
away, and I know they will not shoot her because uh, 
they will not look at her because they know she 
was crying, and they have sometimes a little bit 
feelings with, for some thing like that, and uh, it, 
it, it's very, it was very, very dangerous to do 
anything what, what was not allowed.  Uh, the, what
 I had, when these men came  back, and we all, 
the whole camp had to also stay together, th
e whole camp, and there were um, 10 or 12 uh me n, 
they put them also there together, and they, uh, th
ey shot them each separate, uh, because, uh, that 
they were, that they run away from uh, uh, from 
Sobibor, and killed some  from the uh, Ukrainians. 
These people, people, they run away, they made it,
 they made after the war, they died already.  I 
think they died, one died for sure, and uh, they ma
de it out of the camp.  Uh, it, it was the o-the, 
very dangerous to do anything at all what the Germans uh, uh wouldn't allow, of course. (Sigh) 

 

Of those people, how ma ny escaped and then how ma ny died from the escape?  

 

Uh, two uh, uh run away, ---------.  Two, I thi-two uh, uh 
were escaped.  When, after the war, when 
we had to go uh, when we were in Lublin, one of
 the me n say to us "You 
can come and live with 
us."  And, we stayed with him.  And the other, I, I don't know where he 
is, I never heard about, I 
think he went to Israel.  But two, and uh, it was 
um, eleven people were shot, and, and we had to 
see that, that they were shot.  But, you know, I had 
a system, Chaim and I, we always ma de that we 
stayed next to each other, and I never looked.  
I saw them falling, but I didn't look on the moment 
that they were shooting, and I did it with all th
e things when shooting was very, many times they 
showed that they shot people, or, I, I try not to
 look all the time, because
, I don't know, that was my 
s-system o-o-of surviving, of surviving, uh, not to see when, when some body was completely 

almost half dead, and, and, and like the, the Dutch 
people that were almost half dead, and full with 
blood, that, that they hit them, the way you see them
 in the eyes, you, you, you want to help them. 
So, when you don't look at them... 

 

We've got to reload. 

 

Change film, Came ra roll 4 is up, sync take 4 is up. 

 

I'll remi nd you. 

 

M mmm.  

 
 
 
Beep. 

 

Why did you use your system of not looking into their eyes?  

 

Because when I would look in their eyes, and I 
would their eyes, I would go to them, and help 
them.  And would, I, you know, I would start crying over it, so when I don't look in their eyes, 

don't, don't I, don't feel, I could, you could not 
do anything anyway.  You couldn't do anything 
anyway.  So when I don't look in thei
r eyes, I, I, I don't feel that I,
 I don't have to do anything, that I 
think it was just a shield for myself, to save myself, you know, excuses, or, uh, it was a sh-I just, 

that, that, I, I remember, I always, I, I always, I ne
ver looked at anything real, that, that's my system 
of, now too, I uh, we never look uh 
bad movies, we never see terrible things, we always, you know, 
that's our system, I think, we just survi--it's 
our way of surviving, uh, a
nd not, not, the, also I 

remember that, that man what they cut his head in 
half, I, I saw it, and then I didn't look anymore, I 
just look at the world, I don't look anymore, becau
se uh, we had to stay once on a roll call a whole 
night, and uh, and, everything what 
happened around me, I just stayed next to Chaim, and we just 

both, just, don't try to see everything what is going on, and... 

 

Tell me about Frenzel.   

 

Frenzel took me out of the transport.  And I don't 
know what it was, he was also the one that told 
me  when I was so sick, and had typhus, and he kille
d all the other uh, people, say "Back to work." 
Frenzel...I don't know, he saved me, my life some tim
es.  And he was a terrible ma n.  And, he was 
the one that we had to dance the evening, and, he
 was, he was, uh, uh, he, he, would, he'd give 

Chaim those 45, with the, with th
e whip.  But when I did heavy work once, he took me  out, and let 
me  do a whole day, we had to, uh, with soap that 
people brought, we had to make it in little pieces, 
and we had to, had to do uh, work with soap, and, a
nd um, but also I, it, I, I was afraid for him, 

scared to death for him, of course because the 
ma n, they can change like that, uh, with, with, with 
the idea, what you have, and I was afraid that 
uh, that Frenzel, uh, that 
people would, would see 
that, that they, that he was to me.  But, I reme
mber once uh, we were standing altogether in Camp 

One, and one of the woma n say, "Selma  is a spy," 
because Fre-what Frenzel did to me .  And Oola, 
my buddy, say, "Are you crazy?   She cannot help that 
Frenzel helps her with things like that." 
And, uh, so it's it was very dangerous that an, an,  SS what kills any people some times took me out 

for, for work to do, but...that was, I don't know why, 
it was just my luck perhaps.  When Chaim and 
I w-worked together always, also the SSs, they 
laughed about Chaim and me .  And they say, "The 
Braut and Brautko? ? "   Chai-Chaim and I always
 worked together, and, and we were always 

 
 
together, and, and they always laughed about us.  So
 it was really more a joke perhaps from the SSs 
when they know that we will die anyway.  They
 didn't think that we will make it uh, uh once to 
freedom.   
 

Tell me about the uprising. 

 

I had, on the end, uh, of camp, the, I had the uh, t
yphus.  And, I was very sick.  I don't reme mber 
much about it.  So, that was time also that we we
nt out of uh, of where we slept, we went, they 

ma de, the camp got very big.  Some how, the last 
month of the camp, we go a lot of people from 
Minsk, from the, from the ghetto from Minsk, cam
e to Sobibór.  And the camp, amount of people 
grow, I think that 400 to 600 people, one, uh, ther
e were only 125 people in the camp all those 
months, 4 or 5 months that, that before the camp 
was so big.  So there came the transports from 
Minsk, a transport.  Also, once I walked, and there 
was a girl that was in Svole, my hometown, in 
Holland, and she went back to Germany also, but sh
e came also from the Minsk transport also to uh 

Sobibór, back, it was very unusual to see some
body that you me t in your hometown once.  And, I 
had, uh, and on the end, I had typhus, and the camp got 
very big, and we came  to an, we went to a 

new barrack, new place where the, we all slept, 
and it was bigger, and, uh, I was a little, a little bit 
better, and one day, Chaim say to me , "Go, we, go, 
and..." uh, and, that was a day, two days before 
the uprising.   He say, "Go and try 
to get a pair of boots, and get some warm clothes,  ---------, and I 
will tell you later.  So I say, "No, I don't want to 
go," he say, "Go."  So, I went, and I went to uh, 
by, a place where there was an German SS, and he was pretty good for the Jews.  He got also not 

punished after the war.  And he got me  a pair of 
boots.  And I got a leather jacket, and I got some 
warm clothes, and the next day, Chaim told me to 
come to a place where all the clothes was for, all 
the medicine and everything was in that big house.
  He said, "Come there on 4 o clock."  Chaim 
was the only man that told his girlfriends to go with
 him.  He's the only ma
n that took his girlfriend 
with him.  All the other Polish people, Jewish pe
ople, that were already had, all girlfriends, and 
they all, all left them there.  And, uh, they, 
they, some  were sick, but nobody took his girlfriend. 
Chaim was the only one that took his girlfriend, a
nd he say, "Come down 4 o 
clock."  So, I walked 
to that place at 4 o clock, and I 
remember vividly, very well, that one of the uh, Visupski was his 
name, I think his name was Visupsky, he killed just
 a f--when I came in he killed just a few SSs 

already.  And it was very tense, and he said, "Her
e's a pill for your nerves," and he put it in his 
mouth, and he spit it out, said, "I don't need that."  S
o, we were in there in that, in that house, it was 
a big, big, house what I remember, looks, I don't reme
mber, it was very big, perhaps it was not that 
big, and there were all the medicine, and, if the hous
e ware was there from the transport, the people 
put, the German put it there, and Chaim and I, 
we were standing there talking with a young man 
outside, and it came so far that the one young ma n had to go and kill Neumann, no, not Neumann, 

 
 
uh, another name, forgot his name, had to kill him, 
and, he say, "I'm afraid."  I said, "Chaim, are 
you crazy, there  the, already eleven, ten or eight ar
e dead!"  Said, "You have 
to go!"  Said he, "I'm 
afraid."  And to Chaim, went inside, and 
took a knife, of --------------, and took a knife, quickly a 
knife, put it in his pants, in his shoes because 
he had boots on, and went away.  I didn't even see 
him going.  And, I, I remember, I didn't see Chaim, and I didn't see Chaim, and I went looking for 
him, and I hear fr om, fr om a room where he wa
s killing them, a noise, like he was killing a, a pig, 

when I heard, I heard, I heard sometimes a pig-killing, when we lived in Holland not far from 

farmers, and screaming, and I went quickly back, a
nd we went back to the place where, where we 
had, where Chaim told me  to be, and we had to 
go on roll call, and I went on roll call, and I think, 
"Oh God, what will I do without Chaim? "  And then 
we walked, and then Chaim came  out of this 
house, full with blood, and I thought, "We, we going 
into the world, I had no idea, I know that we 
would run away, but I no I-, I thought we were going 
wherever a lot of people, so I cleaned quickly 
all the blood from his face, and he had a big 
wound on his arm, and I took some thing, I don't know 
what, and I put it around his arm, and then we walk
ed, and then came  a truck, a big truck, but an SS 
came on, and, the same Visupsky jumped on this tr
uck, because when he would have gone to his 

office, and see that they killed already there an
 SS, where Chaim went, 
so he trav-uh, the, uh, 
Visupsky jumped, jumped on this truck, and they k
illed him.  He never, he got, he didn't got out 
alive.  And we went to the camp, to the fi rst ca
mp, Camp One, and there were all the Jews, say 
already, "Hurrah!" and there came a Ukraine and th
ey killed him another one on the bicycle, and 
we went, "Hurrah!" and they start shooting, they 
start shooting from all sides, and Chaim took my 

hand, and all the people were already there, Ch
aim took my hand, and there was a little house, and 
then we saw Frenzel had a pill or something in 
front of him, and start also shooting, so everybody 
stopped at the little house because that house was there,
 and then we had to 
go farther.  Chaim took 
my hand, and he say, "Come!" and we run, and a
ll the people start on running, also again, and we 

start run, and we run, I think to the exit, and 
we heard people screami
ng, and we heard people 
falling on ma nhole against us, and we were luc
ky, we just run and run and I remember, uh, I 
thought, oh I had a necklace around my neck, with a
ll Jewish emblems on it, from all the people 
who, that went to the gas chamber, and, some how 
I found it, and I think, I better take it off, and I 
reme mber taking it off, and throwing it away, a
nd we run, and I took my 
coat off, and I took 
everything off all the warm clothe
s that I, that I had on, I took everything off, and we run and we 

run and we run and we run, till we
 were mi ddle in the woods, and we saw Kurt Thomas, and Kurt 
Thomas say to me, "Where's Milly, his girlfrie
nd?"  You better not put it in, -----.  Anyway we 

run...(laughs). 

 

(laughing) We've got to reload. 

 

 
 
You better not put it in (laughing), you better not put it, no, no you better not put it in (laughing). 
 

Kurtomas say, "Where's Milly, ---------'s girlfriend?  He left her there." 

 

Beep. 

 

What was I saying?   Oh, were running.  

 

You had just found Kurt Thomas in the woods... 

 

Yeah, I me t, yeah, and, and, I saw Kurt Thomas, and we saw, we came  some where, and it was... 

 

Let's stop.  Let's just cut right away because there's ------. 

 

Beep. 

 

We  run and run and, we came to a spot and then
 we saw a whole bunch of
 people from Sobibór, 
and we were happy to see some  more people, and, but
 they were afraid for me, because they didn't 

that a Dutch woma n, you know, that, I will be trad
ed, or, you know, and how 
can I will make it. 
So, they want to shoot Chaim.  Some body was cr
azy, I don't know who it was, he was just crazy 

and want to shoot Chaim, and I jumped in front 
of Chaim, and they didn't shoot me , and so Chaim 
and I, we went alone, and we went away, and we  went, Chaim, we had so
me  money because, from 
the money where were hidden in the ground, and he 
had some  money with him, a lot of money I 
think, I don't know how much.  In that time we thought
 it was  a lot of money.  And he went to a 
farmer, and the farmer say, "Yes, you can stay overni
ght here."  And there was, we stayed in the 
attic, in the farmer's house, and there was a little
 town, and some how, people, the Germans went 
from house to house, from farm to farm, and they
 skipped where we were.  And all the people in 
most houses, dragged them out, and they shot them
.  Because they run away
 a lot of people from 
camp, but most people got caught, 
so I think that not more than 40 or 50 or 30, we don't know 
exactly the amount, that were alive after the war.  So, uh, we, we stayed there overnight, and that 

was the first night that I was together with my
 husband alone, was still my boyfriend, and there was 
no bathroom and it was horrible, and I had diarrh
ea because we have typhus, you get diarrhea, and 

when you're nervous you get diarrhea, and I some how never forgot I had to go to the bathroom 

there, and, and years and years and years later, year
s and years later, I still felt awful that I had to 
go to the bathroom the upstairs and just left it such a mess, in these people's house there, that was 

just for me , one of the things, crazy, but that wa
s...From there, we walked, and we walked, at, at 

 
 
night.  In daytime, we hide in the woods.  A
nd many times, uh, we walked at night, and there came 
a dog after us, got barking, and we didn't, we walk
ed on the stars.  Chaim wanted to go to his 
farmer, and we walked on the star
s.  And, we couldn't, we, we went the wrong side, I me an, who 
car-who cares, we went, and, we came in the woods, and, some times we saw an animal, and saw 
his legs, we thought it was a ----------- that was looking 
for us, and we slept the whole night there, 
and, and, uh, once we went in a very big woods, a
nd, and before we went in the woods we saw a 
body laying there, and we were scared to death to
 go in there, but, we didn't know where we were 
going really.  We  just walk on the stars.  And, uh, we walked two weeks.  We  didn't have to eat, 

and I remember, I jumped once in water, and I 
took my boots off at night, and daytime when we 
hid, hid somewhere, and I couldn't get my boots on 
anymore, so I had to walk, I have, Chaim had 
to cut it open, and I had to walk on the side of 
my, of my shoe, the whole, whole time, and, and, 
when the shoe got small, I couldn't, the boots got
 smaller, I couldn't get it on anymore, and, so it 

was, and, and, and, we, we couldn't wash, we di
dn't have to eat, we, uh, we were hungry, we had 

little bit food what we could find in the fields, wewere eating.  And, we tried to find the Partisans, 

and we couldn't find them, and we hide daytime, so
metimes we tried to get to a farmer, but never 
could f-find a farmer uh, where we 
could stay.  Chaim, my husband, remembers that we could stay 
with farmers, but I don't remember that we ever st
ayed with any farmer at
 night.  And, we hide uh, 
once in an hay...stack, and w-we had kids comi ng to it, and they say to each other in Polish, well, I 

didn't understand them, my husband told me, that 
we go jump on this haystack, and we lay under 
the hay, and uh, they came on top of us, and they 
ran off and say, "Jews! Jews!"  How they know 
that so quick, I don't know, but they say, "Jews!  
Jews!" And they ran away, and we quickly went 
off, and there came 2 farmers with a car where we
 were walking in a fiel
d, and they took us, and 
they ask us if we want to take, go with them
, and one took Chaim, and the other took uh, I with 
them.  And when we drove away, Chaim, they
 didn't unders-know that Chaim spoke Polish, and 
they say to Cha--to each other, "Somehow, we w
ill take the money from them," or something like 
that, and Chaim say to me, "Selma, jump!"  and I 
jumped and he jumped and then we run, and we 
run, and we, I remember also vivi
dly we went once, and we were so thirsty, and we went to a 
farmer, and we asked if we can have a little bit of 
water, and he say, "No."  It was a very beautiful, 
uh, farm.  Could see the sitting bay  and the firepl
ace, and he said, "No!" and closed the door in 
front of us, so, uh, we hadn't, we had no -------, we
 didn't see Partisans, we didn't know, we, that 
we'r e hungry, we didn't have anything to eat, and 
we didn't know what to do, and once we came  to 
a farm, and he took us in, and Chai
m ask him if he can hide us.  Slept in the barn, we always slept 

in, always when we slept in the haystack, and 
he say, "No."  I cannot, I didn't understand all these 
things, of course, with the, with the polish, I 
didn't understand a word, Polish.  And, he says, "You 
know, by my brother."  So, he dressed me  up like 
an old woma n, and I was 20, (ha ha), and, with a 
old woma n, and, uh, he brought us, uh, Chaim was uh, in a wagon, and on the, on the, and branches 

 
 
over him, and we were lucky, well, it was very, 
very dangerous what the ma n did.  One went, a 
German would ask him, "What, what are you havi
ng there? " he would shoot him and he would go 
his farm and shoot his whole family, and burn dow
n everything.  So, he br
ought to a farmer, his 
name  was Adam, and when we came there, we, he le
t us in a room.  We had very bad scabies, and 
this is sickness on the skin, from dirt.  Ver--I had 
it very bad, Chaim not so bad.  And we had lice, 
of course, Sobibór, and, very, 
very bad, I had it over my whole body.  And, uh, uh, when we, he, 
we could wash us, he let us wash, and he saw 
that Chaim had a lot of money, he had it under the 
bandage on his leg, and he saw Chaim had a lot of 
money, and I think, he didn'
t think that he wants 
to help Jews, he's thinking that it's for the mone
y.  Perhaps he did it also
 for, it's not, no, I think 
perhaps he did it also to help these people.  Chaim say he, because he saw me , I was young, and, 
and he, and he, he always thought some body fr
om, from Holland or from New Yo--from our, 
America, he always wanted to go to America, th
e farmer.  So, because of me , what Chaim thinks, 

he took us in.  And also of th
e money.  We  give him all the money what we had, and, uh, so, we 
cou-we were, we stayed above the cows, in, in th
e barn with the cows, and above they had beams, 
and on the beams was hay stacks, and above was, a
nd, a hay roof, with holes in it.  Thank God we 
could look through the holes, we 
didn't have anything to do the whole day, and we were not 
allowed to move.  Once we moved, and he came 
down the farmer on the bottom, and he moved, 
and the farmer said, "What is that? "   Say, "Oh," he said, "We have some rats, uh, rats, upstairs," 

which was true.  There were rats all over.  So, 
we were not allowed, we were there 9 months, and 
we were not allowed to move, we were not allowe
d to talk, and we had a little pail in the fr ont of 
us, our toilet, and we were under the, what I said
 before, the lice, and he tried sometimes to burn 
our clothes in, in, when in the hot stove, to kill the lice, but it didn't work, and uh, we did, is a 

medication in Poland, and of course here too, th
at when you can put it on the Scabie, and it dies 
right away.  So, we were very sick from it b
ecause I had it on my back and on my body, and it, it 
was, it itched, it was very, very painful, and I was, 
I was very sick.  I was, I could almost not walk, 
and, and so we asked him, we have one watch, and 
when we give him the watch, if they want to go 
for us, and pay that in Helm, there was a little town not far fr om we lived, and want to pay us the 

medication.  And finally once they did it  where the,
 the, it was so in our skin, that uh, it, it, the 
ointment didn't help anymore, and we were very 
upset of course, we, we blamed this ma n.  We  
didn't get much to eat.  And we didn't wash ourselves, I think, just once, in all the nine months, we 

never washed ourselves.  We ll we didn't, ah we
 didn't care.  We were
 not hungry, real hungry, but 
we got once a day we got food, a
nd, we, we saved always the bread, and we put it between our 
heads, the rats came at night, and they took it awa
y, so we didn't do that anymore, and, and we, we 
felt very uh, uh, mi serable there because we thought 
that they were not good for u-us.  Now, after 
all these years, and af-right afte
r the war we know that they were very good for us because they 
really saved our lives, but it was very danger
ous because when the neighbors were all big 

 
 
antisemites, and I knitted sometimes for her, wh
en she was spinning, she ma de, uh, weaving her 
own, uh, yarn from linen, and I knitted clothes for th
is little boy that was 2 years old or 3 years old, 
and the neighbors ask her how you got these nice cl
othes, so, that was already dangerous, when 
she, they know they couldn't afford to buy it.  So, we, we didn't do anything 
the whole, there, from 
the beginning, we were allowed to knit.  Chai
m was knitting, and I was knitting, but later on we 
were not allowed to do anything uh, for them, so th
ey, they were very, very poor, and it was a very 
uh, I go too much into that?  
 

(Sandy says something--can't  hear). 

 

I go too much into that?  

 

No, we have to reload. 

 

Beep. 

 

Okay, you were just concluding with the family, 
who, in a sense, rescued you and Chaim by hiding 

you. You were telling me  they were poor, and... 

 

Yeah, yeah, yes, we were uh, they were very poor, a
nd they did the best that they could really, and 
we want, perhaps, we felt so sorry for ourselv
es laying there, and, uh, on the end, I remember, uh, 
there, there was a little boy that was running after 
the birds, and it was already, we heard already 
the Germans comi ng up a,  uh, we hear already n
earer comi ng the, uh, war comi ng, the front.  We  
hear already bombs near, comi ng to us, and a little boy went after these, and uh, at once he sees us. 

And thank God a day later, were, were the Ge
rmans run a-we saw the Germans running away, and 
uh, we got freed.  Uh, it was a very difficult time. 
 Uh, uh we were, we didn't have anything to do. 
Also once we were watching always the storks,the storks on the chimney, and we were watching 

the storks when we didn't have anything else to
 do.  And, the storks went away. And, the uh, the 
farmers, uh, they think that it brings some-somethi
ng to them, or a fire or something is comi ng to 
them when the storks going away.  So one day he say to me, "What are you doing the whole day?  

Are you perhaps watching the storks? "
  And we say, "Yes."  So, so, he, when the, when the storks 
going away, you have to go.  We  cannot have you a
nymore because then is uh, something bad will 
happen to us.  So, we stopped wa
tching the storks, and thank God, the storks came back.  And, I 
was very weak.  I didn't know that I was pregnant.  I didn't have, I didn't have my period all these 

years that I was in concentration camp, and I was very weak, I couldn't walk anymore, and I didn't 

get heavier, and, I, I couldn't s-s-sit up almost
 anymore, and we didn't know anything that was 

 
 
going on, and the, the woma n uh, where we were hi
dden say, say that I was 
pregnant, I said, "No, 
that's not true.  I have, I don't grow, and well, 
I didn't walk, and I was just laying.  And she say, 
"You have to go.  We  don't want you anymore.  And 
later we talked that it is not so, and now, and 
then, in July the, July, we went down, and then 
I found out I was six months
 pregnant.  And that 
was, we never told this in 40 years, and that wa
s very bad of course, well, we thought, what will we 
do?   We  had nothing.  We  went, it was free, we
 were free.  We  had no money, we had nothing, 

absolutely nothing. No, no clothes, only what we ha
d on, and that was it.  So, we went to Helm, 

and then we found, we thought we were the onl
y Jews alive, of course, we thought every 
concentration camp was really like Sobibór, but, a
nd then we found more people alive in Helm. 

We came in a home in Helm, and then Chaim had to
 go in the army.  And I was there in Poland, all 
alone, I didn't speak Polish, we had no money.  So 
Chaim started working in a hospital.  We  saw 
that helps.  And, I also never forget, once...they all 
went back to Sobibór. All the Jews went back to 
Sobibór because all the Jews, we put so much
 money in the ground, and everybody went back to 
Sobibór to get, take the money out of the ground, 
and they starting fighting there and killing each 

other.  So I said to Chaim, "That's not worth it. 
 You don't go."  So, we didn't go back to Sobibór to 
get the money uh, out of the ground.  But all, most 
Jews did it.  And one Jew did, and one of the 
Jews, Chaim knows already a little bit around, he was al
ways in business, and so we walked a little 
bit around, and one gave him a hundred dollar bill,
 and Chaim say, "I know a place where I can 
change it for you."  So, perhaps I can change 
it for you, but of course, the number was gone, and 
that was not valuable.  So, we put it that ni
ght under our pillow.  And mi ddle in the night, 
somebody stole it under our pillow out. 
 So, the next day, Chaim told him, and he didn't believe it, 
of course.  So, the first morning that Chaim made
 with, I don't know with wh
at, with working in the 
hospital, not to go in the army when we saw that we get fr ee in the army, and later this was not. 

Then he start selling, I think, gasoline, what he
 brou--I don't know what he did really exactly, I 
don't reme mber, and we paid this ma n off.  So, so th
at was a ver-a very bad situation.  I have to tell 
something that, 20 years, 15 years later we were in 
Israel, and we came together with all the Jews 
from Sobibór, and I say to the ma n, "Do you reme
mber the hundred dollars that they stole under 
our pil-pillow? "  He said, "Yeah, you still owe me 
the hundred dollars."  And the next day, he came 
with some body, and we paid him the hundred dollars because he say he nee--my husband say, 

"When he needs the hundred dollars so badly that he 
has to come to Israel, if, to our house, then he 
needs it very bad."  So, when we went, went away 
from Sobibór, from this farmer, we stayed with 
uh, in Helm a very short time.  We ll, you don't want to know that. 

 

I want to ask you a couple things.  I want you to
 talk about how you lived for one mi nute to the 
next when you were in the camp.  I want you to go back, and tell me  how you feel you survived.   

 

 
 
Okay, I don't reme mber.  Uh, I, I, how, we surviv
ed in Sobibór was most because we had each 
other.  I don't think that, I would have been like 
all the Dutch people who died very quickly after 
that, that, I think that we had 
each other, and also we were very close, and uh, I found a cousin 
there, a first cousin.  And, and, 
and a girl where they came from Holland, Oola.  Oola was there. 
We stick together, and we helped each other very
 much because, uh, I got typhus, and she took care 
of me , and I took care of her when she was sick, and 
we took care of each other.  And the, the, the 
tense atmosphere in Sobibór was so bad that I, I,
 I don't want even to think back on that, how, how 
bad it was.  Because every mi nute 
of the day, we were called to do some thing else.  Like, when, 
even when we walked from Camp 2 to Camp 1, we
 had to, we never could walk regular, we had to 
sl, uh, uh, --------------------, throw ourselves
 on the floor, and we had to go up, and the ma n with 
the whip on the back of us that we had to do that
 till we almost not could walk anymore.  Uh, when 
we came on, we had to stand in line for food.  So
me times there was no food.  And sometimes, the, 
the, the once I remember the coo-the cook, they, th
ey killed him almost when he was sitting mi ddle 
of, of the place in the mi ddle from where we, 
were sleeping, and, uh, we, we, uh, we couldn't get 
food on that day, and I reme mber once, an, a young ma n, he was 16 years old, and he was the 

favorite of one of the SSs reall
y, and he was sleeping, and one of Wa gner came  into his room, and 
he said, "Go,---------------, " and he hit a little bit some 
with his whip when he had this whip laying 
next to him.  And the, the SS t
ook him out and shot him.  And, that, that was, every mi nute of the 

day was a,  was, a such a, in, in danger, in danger 
about your own life that, I, I, that we tried not to 
think about it at all because I remember that we
 had to go in the woods once, and, and pick uh, 
blueberries.  And on the end of the day they had to 
show our tongue of we, ha
d a, if we eat one of 
the blueberries.  And we would have eaten all of 
the blueberries, they would have punished us with 
40 whips or 80 whips, but they didn't shoot so much woma n, the more the me n.  Uh, and it it, 

everything that you did was, what was, was scary, 
and was dangerous.  Also
 we had uh, uh, to pick, 
uh mushrooms in the woods, I reme mber.  And, I put 
it in my underpants all over.  And they ask us, 
"Did you hide some thing? "  I was very heavy fr
om the water, --------------, in camp, so they didn't 
see it that I had it, was full with mushrooms, but 
when they would have looked at it, they would 
have should, they would have done some th
ing to punish me. Uh, but--------------, every time you 
saw some body else got punished and 
got hit, and we have to look all the time when they give 45 
whips or uh, the, all the time we had to look that th
ey did things like that, and I think that we didn't 

get insane, it was because we had each other, Chaim 
and I.  We  were always together, we try, not 
when we work most of the time, in daytime when
 we had to go in the woods, but then I was worry 
if I was here.  Once we were, uh, on a roll call, and, uh, there was and, uh some body ran away, so, 

they took ten, every ten people they took out, out
 of the roll call, and Chaim was #9, and I was 
standing there, you know, it was, you were always, always uh, uh in danger.  Many times we had to 

stay the whole night on roll call uh, because there 
was an a dog or a cat or some one of the ----------

 
 
, and they thought that we run aw
ay.  And, and, Chaim and I, we al-always stayed together, and, 
and I think that that made me uh, that made us that
 we are we stayed uh, I think, I really think that 
saved our lives.   

 

Before the war, tell me  about... 

 

Beep. 

 

I want you to tell me about the choices that you think the Germans and Ukrainians had as guards. 

 

How you mean?  

 

Did they do things of their own fr ee will, or was 
it all ordered, and then what choices did the Jews 
have?  

 

The, the Germans could do with us what they want
.  They had no orders whatsoever.  They could 
kill us, they could harm us, they could punish us, they could do anything they want.  The 

Ukrainians, I don't know much about because they, I, I don't know much about because they, I 

didn't speak Polish, and I couldn't talk with them at
 all, and they were always more on the outside--

I really don't remember much about it.  But, uh, th
ey were such, also such antisemites, they, they 
were there of fr ee will, and the Germans were in, 
in Sobibór for, because of the fr ee will, they 
didn't have to come.  They didn't have to go in the, in the war, fighting on th
e front when they went 
to a concentration camp, so they went by themselves to the SS.  Uh, the Germans, they had fr ee 

will and they could do anything, and they did.  They
 had, that was there biggest pleasure, to tell 
each other, uh, that we killed, uh, one of the SSs called, uh, told once that he could kill, he had a 

very big whip made, that he could kill a Jew in
 10 whips, instead of 40 for some body else, or 50. 

Uh, once he had uh, Frenzel telling that he uh, that he
 throws babies in the fire, uh, what, from the 
transports, what he came on, what was too much work
 to put them perhaps uh, in the gas chamber. 
Uh, they could do anything they wa
nt.  There was not such a thing--humanity--what were in these 
Germans, uh, at all.  Perhaps one, one, what was,
 what give me the boots, but uh, like Frenzel and, 
and Wa gner, and Wolf was, what, what was some
times nice to us, my, also he was eating bread, 

and he said, "Here, would you like to have a piece? " 
 and we said, "No," most of the time, and they 
let us singing and dancing all the time when the fi
re was there, we had to do, no, I don't think there 
was one decency in these people's bloods whatso
ever, uh what I don't uh, uh, in the Ukraine, uh, 
they, they, I don't know much about it. The Polish Jews, they know more about that because they 

could talk their language, but, uh... 

 
 
 
What about the Jews, did they have choices?   Talk about the choice to leave or not to leave. 

 

No, it was no choice.  We  had no choice for anyt
hing.  We had no choice.  I remember, once, I 
walked, I don't know how come , I walked by myself
, and I saw people from my home town sitting 
there on the side, the, the cantor from our temple
, and then I saw ----------, and I said, "Hi" to them, 
and then I remember I better don't say anything when 
I, when he say Hi to me , then he, then they 
will say uh, "Oh, you want to sit there too? " and that
's the end o-of me .  We  didn't have, we didn't 

have anything.  We  just were like a, a herd of, he
rd of sheep, and we had to everything what they 
say, and God forbid we, we did.  We  tried to ev
erything what the Germans say, I remember, once, 
uh, out of the window that I saw a whole family
 from my hometown, uh, walking, whole family, 
father, mother and children, and I, I just, I, uh, 
uh, was ma ybe sure that they wouldn't see me, but 
when they would have seen me , wh-what would 
I have said?   Uh, and, 
and I know that uh, I see 
them still walking, and, and, after the years I forgot
 the names, but many times I saw people that I 
know from, well, from face, uh, walking to the death, to the death.  But we didn't have anything to 

say in camp.  Nothing.  We just made sure that
 we were always in th
e background, and that we 
didn't, uh, especially Chaim always told me, "B
e in the background.  Don't let them know who you 
are," and we tried that so much as possible, and I 
think that was of the things that uh, (clears throat) 
that saved, that we were saved, that we were 
not muscled? ?  to death, because, uh, a lot of them 
were muscled to death, uh, especially Dutch people. 
 But some how the, the, 
they saved a lot, the, 
the Dutch uh, woma n, the woma n, I saw how uh, the 
me n was more, more uh, in danger of it, and 
Chaim always tried to push me, when I am alrea
dy quickly go in the front and do things, and come  
up for people.  No, he always told me , "Stay out 
of it, stay out of it.  Leave it alone."  And you 
couldn't do anything anyway.  There was nothi
ng that you could do.  Uh, you could nothing do. 
Was nothing, nothing.  You had to just take care 
of yourself.  And, to sabotage to, against the 
Germans, both of us do sabotage.  Where we once, 
where, in the camp where we slept, that that 
was the only thing we could do, stay in the b
ackground, and, and don't show yourself so much in 
the front.  That's all. 

 

Before the war, can you tell me about the J on 
passports, and how the underground removed yours, 
and then -----------------------. 

 

I don't remember much what they did.  When I was home, and, and there came a Catholic priest 

what lived on our street, and he came to me
 and he say, um, "What do you, how do you think you 

can save your life? "  And I say to him, "The only way is that I uh, wo-be, be as a non-Jew, and that 

somebody picks me up."  And he, and somebody else cam
e to pick me up early in the morning, that 

 
 
was coincident, my English teacher, and he pick me
 up early in the morning at 5 o clock and went 
with the bicycle, and that was the last time that
 I saw my mother and my, and my brothers, my 
family, I never saw them again.  And, I think I cam
e to a nurse from my hometown.  Darot was the 
name .  And she, through her, they, they, she 
knows what, she was in the underground, and through 
her, they took the J from my passport because that's
 the only way that I, that I was, by a woma n that 
was, say, where I was, she was good.  Because she, 
I went after 3 months, waiting, hiding with her, 
she took a whole family in, and I had to go to anot
her family, and the other family were traitors, 
what I found out after the war, I didn't know.  A
nd I was hidden there 3 m
onths, and, and they, uh, 
had 28 Jews hidden there, and they all got caught, 
and they didn't do anything to them, and  so and, 
and, uh, you want me  to tell you about how I was 
caught?   Caught. Uh, I, 
uh, when I was hidden 
there, I was all alone always in the house, and I was, uh, 19 years old, and I was very depressed, 

and very, I had to clean the house, I was the maid there, and I was a spoiled brat from home, I 

never had to do anything, and I had to do everything 
there, and they went away the whole day, and 
we didn't, I didn't get anything to eat.  Well, ther
e was not much food in Holland.  There was, it was 
very, it was a ver-a really starting to get ve
-uh, no food, and uh, where the people were very 
hungry, and I uh was alone, and there was in the str
eet where a lawyer, there were Jewish people 
hidden.  And after that, it was a few months, they 
say I could go there, and visit them.  And when 
the mi nute I come in, the Germans come, so ther
e was it, some body told the Germans.  And, the 
Germans, and the police, the Ho--the Dutch Police 
came, and they, and when I was there, I say to 
them, the, the, they ask me the passport, and I 
show my port, uh, passport, and I say, "Oh, but I'm a 
nurse, and I come here to help these people, and 
they loo-hold my passport to the light, and they 
right away saw there was a, there was the J, from 
Jew, was in there, and so there was nothing what 
they could do.  So, so uh, they right away took me , 
and also the family that was there, there was a 
father and mother and 2 children, and they all ha
d asthma, I remember they were so sick from--
asthma  come s up when they, when you're nervous, 
and they were so sick, and the woma n where 
they were hidden, uh, was an olde
r lady from 80 years old, so the Germans asked me  where I was 
hidden, and I didn't want to tell them.  Because th
e, uh, the day bef-uh, before I was, came  another 
Jewish family living upstairs, and I thought when th
ey find out that I was caught, that perhaps they 
have a chance to get away, and that was happe
ned, and, uh, they uh, some how got the note that I 
was, that the German took us, of, of the police,
 and, uh, see they had time to get run away.  But 
they, after the war, they sent me a letter that, of
, of thanks,  And, but the woma n where, what they, 
were, or the lady where they were caught, she told
 the Germans where I was hidden, and they went 
later over there, and they took uh, what it was, I don't know exactly, but I went down to Utza in the 

police station, and I stayed there 8 days, and I had 
a chance to get away, but somehow, I didn't.  I 

didn't want to go away.  First of all, I had 
no money.  And I thought, I didn't know the underground 
was already that strong, and I uh, di
dn't want to go in, in or out if the Ger-the police give me little 

 
 
notice here.  We probably like to take you out, we
 probably like to take 
you out.  And, I didn't get 
along with my sister-in-law, she's still alive, I di
dn't get along with my sister-in-law, and I visit 
once my brother, and they were locked up in the 
little room with the 2 kids, and it was dirty, and it 
was mi serable, and I say, I rather go to my mother 
in Poland than go to my brother when I get out, I 
have to go to my brother, and be hidden there,
 and, and help him with the little kids--I didn't know 
that there was a gas chamber or something like this, 
so I go rather to my mother in Poland, than I be 
locked up in there, with my brother there, so I di
dn't get out of the, uh, out 
of the, uh, police station. 
After that, they sent me , we were 
in, in an um, in, in Amsterdam in jail.  In 3 months I was in jail. 
And (clears throat), the, we were 10 woman in a little room, and it was very interesting because 

everybody tells the life story, and they were all, we
ll, there was a professor's wife, one was a girl 
from the street, and one was d
eaf? ?   And, uh, and, we, it wasn™t, we didn't feel any danger, and, 
and, and anyway, I didn't, I thought 
we go to, I had, I didn't think anything.  And we got, my family 
from Amsterdam where we were sent me  some times
 packages, and one of the g-guards that opened 
the door recognized somehow that I wa-that my brother was in hotel school, and that uh, she knows 

him, and from that time out we get double food, all 
of us in the cell got extra food.  So, we didn't 
have it that bad in, in the, in the jail, jail.  U
h, it was uh, we had to walk every morning so like a, 
like you see in the Sing-Sing, where there always some-sometimes movies from, and we stayed 

there, or, I stayed there 3 months.  And then I we
nt out of there, and we went to a concentration 
camp, and in the office, I me t a whole bunch of Dutc
h girls.  I met these Dutch girls, we stayed 
together till Sobibór.  We , and, we from there, wewent to uh, Furcht, we were in a concentration 

camp in Holland 3 months, and uh, I was also very
 lucky, there come s a man to me , and he say, 
"Are you not the daughter from the ho-from the Wei
nberg-from the hotel in Zuola, and I say, "yes." 
Said he, "I have a job for you." 
 And he was the big shot already.  It was, the camp was just 
opened, and he uh, give me a job assorting clothes 
in the, in the laundromat, and I worked in the 

laundromat, and it was very good because I was that
, uh, uh, big, I had that uh, to tell people what 
they had to do.  And, I could get away from ther
e too.  I could have gone in the laundry, in the 
basket sit in, very easy, but, I didn't know that
 there was an underground in Holland, and I didn't 
have money.  When I would have had some  money 
in my pocket, I would have done it.  But, I 
thought, when I come  out of here, where do I go?  
 They can right away see I'm Jewish, and, and, 
and, and, I don't know why I thought this way that th
ey right away could have seen that I was 

Jewish, that's what I thought because in my hometown, was a not so big town, they would have 

right away seen, had, uh, recognized me , and, so, I we
nt, from there, I went to uh, after 3 months, I 
went to We sterbork, and in We sterbork...
