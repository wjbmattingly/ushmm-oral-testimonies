A:  Yes.  I have a brother, George Anth ony Dankner.

A:  Yes.  
 
Q:  Yes.  And what -- when  
did your family move to Buda
pest?  Wh en did your father 
move?  
 
A:  When  he was a baby.
 

Q:  Okay .
 
A:  I don't know, at age one, 
I think, or one and a half.  
 
Q:  Okay, so the family was firmly based in Budapest? 
 
A:  Yes, yes, yes.  He served in the Aust
ro-Hungarian Army duri
ng the first world war.  
 
Q:  Okay , and what language or la
nguages were spoken in your home?  
 
A:  Hungarian.  
 
Q:  Just Hungarian?
 
A:  Yes.  
 
Q:  And did all of your immediate fami ly
, meaning your brother and your parents and 
yourself, survive the Holocaust?
 
A:  Yes.  
 
Q:  And did your extended family, grandparents, 
aunts, uncles, cousins, did they also live 
in Budapest?
 
A:  Yes.  
 
Q:  And were they -- 
 
A:  Well, there were some in the United States.  
 
Q:  Okay .  
 
A:  There were some in, we found out, in 
Sw itzerland.  There was somebody in  Ro mania.  
There were others.  A couple 
of them were in England.  
 
Q:  Okay .  
 
A:  As a matter of fact, my grandfather's 
-- there were seven brothers, and two of the 
brothers went to Pale
stine in the 1800's.  
 
Q:  And did, so did grandparen
ts and uncles, were they involv
ed  in your life in Budapest?  
 
A:  Well, only up to  a point because they pa
ssed away wh en both my  brother and I were 
quite young.  
 
Q:  Okay, okay.  
 
A:  As a matter of fact, I was name
d after one of my  grandfathers.  
 
Q:  Okay .  And wh at did your parents do fo r a living?  
 

A:  My father was the foremost jeweler in 
Budapest, was decorated at an international 
exhibition by Prince Joseph from 
the Habsburg Court, and he 
was given the equivalent at 
that time M aster of the Gold, of
 the Golden  Wreath.  That would have been an equivalent 
to being knighted in  Engla
nd and being called "sir".  
 
Q:  Okay .  And what kind 
of jewelry did he make?
 
A:  He was making -- of course, in those days
 it was all fine handmade jewelry, and he 
designed them all, and 
he had all the, the nobility and 
the, and the stars from movie and 
theater as his customers.  
 
Q:  Okay , and so  would you have consid
ered your family pretty well off?  
 
A:  At the time we did not know.  My parents 
did, never divulged  wh at they were worth, 
for the right reasons, because later on it wa
s proven that the Hungarian police and the 
Nazis were picking up children 
and giving them candy and chocolate and asking them a 
lot of questions about the parents.  
 
Q:  Okay .  To try and find out where the money was?  
 
A:  Right, exactly.  
 
Q:  Right.  And did you have, did yo
u have household maids or servants?  
 
A:  Yes, we did; we did, yes.
 
Q:  And was your fami ly religious?
 
A:  Conservative.
 
Q:  Okay.  And did you r
eceive religious instruction?
 
A:  Yes.  We went to a Jewish elementary school 
and a Jewish gymnasium.                 
               
              
Q:  Okay.  And what do you 
recall about your relations w
ith non-Jews?  Obviously your 
father had cu stomers who weren't Jewish. A: 
 Yes, of course; but my  relation was, and 
my  brother's, only that when  we were beaten
 up by other kids on the street because we 
were so identifiable because of the emblem o f 
our school, gymnasium on our caps.         
                         
Q:  Okay, so that Œ- 
 
A:  Yeah.  
 
Q:  -- you definitely experienced.  
 
A:  It was never, it was not a amicable encounter.  
 
Q:  Okay , and was the neighborho
od that you lived in, was it -- 
 
A:  It was the central --
 

Q:  -- a Jew ish neighborhood?  
 
A:  No, it was the central part of Budapest.  
 
Q:  What street was it?  
 
A:  It was the H-A-J-O Street.  
 
Q:  Okay .  And wh at synagogue did you go to?  
 
A:  We went to the -- well, it
's w h at's called the Rumbach.  
 
Q:  Sure.
 
A:  If you've heard about it.
 
Q:  Um-hm.
 
A:  Yes.  And so metimes to the D
ohany, the largest one in Budapest.  
 
Q:  Okay .
 
A:  But mostly to the Rumbach, and that
's where both my  brother and I were bar 
mitzvahhed.  
 
Q:  Okay , and did you, di
d you -- did your family attend services regularly?  
 
A:  Yes.  
 
Q:  Okay.  So, so obviously
 your, you know, you suffered 
at the hands of anti-Semitic 
school children?  
 
A:  Well, yes, I mean.  
 
Q:  And what about on a po
litical level, were you old 
enough to be aware of Œ-
 
A:  No.  
 
Q:  Okay .  
 
A:  No.  The only thing that I -- I mean, 
I knew that they were
 electing people to 
parliament, but I mean from what party or
 who they were, I re
ally did not, no.
 
Q:  And did you feel anything from your pare
nts that they were worried as things got 
worse or -- 
 
A:  Yes, yes, yes, yes.  My father was quite
 -- well, he, he was cognizant of the fact what 
was going on starting in 1938, and later on th
ere were refugees coming from Poland, and 
he was one of the places they 
came for funds to he
lp them go to, to Italy or, you know, 
leave the country.
 

Q:  Okay, so he helped.
 
A:  Yeah.
 
Q:  He helped, yeah.
 
A:  Yes, yes.
 
Q:  But he -- did you feel like your family 
felt that there was any imminent threat in 
Hungary?
 
A:  When ?  
 
Q:  Well, from -- you know, as Germany sort of expanded  and started taking over other 
countries?  
 
A:  Well, only inasmuch that the Hungaria
n government, an ally of the Nazis, was 

bringing in laws that would curtail Je
wish activities like attending college Œ-
 
Q:  Right.  
 
A:  -- becoming a docto r or engineer.  They ha
d a very , very small percentage that they 
accepted, only the top, top students, and 
later on that too was done away with.  
 
Q:  Right, right.  And were yo
u aware of the Arrow Cross?  
 
A:  Oh, yes.  
 
Q:  Yeah.  And, and -- 
 
A:  As a matter of fact, they were 
marching many times under our windows.  
 
Q:  Okay , and so  I assume you feared them and, and -- 
 
A:  Well, I mean, you know, at 
that time that was the, way be
fore the war, we didn't  fear 
them because they were not, they
 did not have any real power Œ 
 
Q:  Right.  
 
A:  -- because just the demonstrations that they -- the same thing 
like the Ku Klux Klan 

has done here.  
 
Q:  Um-hm.
 
A:  You know.  
 
Q:  Okay .
 
A:  You didn't want to get in their way and y
ou didn't w ant to face them; but, no, we were 

not particularly scared Œ 
 

Q:  Right.  
 
A:  -- at that time. 
 
Q:  And so how mu ch did yo
u know, how many details did 
you or your family know 
about the treatment that Jews were receiving 
-A:  Oh, that we knew, that we knew.  
 
Q:  -- in Germany?  
 
A:  Yes.  
 
Q:  You knew about Kristallnacht?  
 
A:  Well, at that time we did not know about
 Kristallnacht, but we 
knew about what was 
going on in Germany because, 
you know, at the dinner table these things were discussedŒ 
 
Q:  Um-hm.  
 
A:  -- and mentioned, and so 
we were -- I mean, we didn't really -- my brother was 13, I 
was 14 at the time, so, you know, we did no
t, we were busy with our own activities -- 
 
Q:  Concerns.  
 
A:  -- more or less; and, but, yes, we were 
aware because we belonged to the Boy Scouts, 
but we could not be called Boy Scouts.
 
Q:  Okay.  Okay, because -- 
 
A:  Because there was no such thing as a Jewi
sh Boy Scout Q:  Okay
, okay, and, but at 
that point your family didn't  consider trying to immigrate or -- 
 
A:  Yes, my father did.  Oh, it was in 19 -- 
in 1934, I think if I'm correct, he did get an 
American visa, and he was one of
 -- let's see, my uncle and my
 aunt, one of five children, 
and one of the girls came to the United States
, and the other, the rest of them were over 
there.  One, one passed away, and my  grandmot
her said to my dad, he was the supporter 
of the family, more or less, his parents, I meant Œ 
 
Q:  Um-hm.  
 
A:  -- and she said, If you're leaving, 
who will be left to be with me?  
 
Q:  Okay .  
 
A:  And he didn't  leave.  
 
Q:  And did he feel like he 
wanted to try to leave becaus
e of the political situation?  
 
A:  Yes.  He wanted my brothe
r and I to have a better life.  
 

Q:  But it wasn 't necessarily related to 
anti-Semitism or to wh
at was happening in 
Germany?  
 
A:  Well, to be honest with you, that I do not know.  
 
Q:  Okay .
 
A:  I do not -- I know he also tried to leave in
 1938.  Again, it was an American visa, and 
the unfortunate thing was that he had a ch
oice of leaving from Genoa or Bremen -- 
 
Q:  Okay
 
A:  -- and he picked Bremen, and the Germ
ans wouldn't give us transit visas.  
 
Q:  I see.
 
A:  So he couldn't leave.
 
Q:  Okay, okay, and so at, at what point 
-- I guess you were conscripted into a forced 
labor battalion?  
 
A:  Well, it was at that time 
not a forced labor battalion, it was a -- well, in Hungary they 
had the equivalent of the Hitler ?Ugan?.  
 
Q:  Right.  
 
A:  But Jews could not be, belong there and get 
their military training, et cetera, et cetera.  
What we had to do is wore a yellow arm 
band, and we were take
n out to th e shooting 
ranges and had to pick up th e l
eads from the bullets th
at they were firing.  Of course, not 
while they were firing, but clean up the place.  
 
Q:  Um-hm. 
 
A:  That was our job.  And we had to have, 
I think if I recall properly, twice a week for 
two hours each day.  
 
Q:  And how old were you at that point?  
 
A:  At that point I was four -- 
in 1938 I was 10
 years, 10 years 
 
old.                              
                                
 
Q:  Okay.  And so -- but later on you were injured, 
I guess?                       
 
A:  No.  I mean, not injured, bu
t, you know, just beaten up on 
 
the streets.  
 
Q:  But I have -- I'm just looking at my  notes here Œ 
 

A:  Yes.  
 
Q:  -- and it says that you broke your 
co llar bone or something or that was -- 
 
A:  No, no, no.  
 
Q:  That was later?  
 
A:  No, that's the whole -- 
that's th e miracle story of 
our being still alive today.  
 
Q:  Okay , okay.
 
A:  That was my  dad, and it was -- all 
right, you want me to
 tell my  story now?
 
Q:  Yes.
 
A:  Okay .  We have escaped death by being able
 to get into the Kasztner Group.  I don't, I 
don't know if I have to elaborate wh at the Kasztner Group was. 
 
Q:  No -- if you want.  I know what it is Œ- 
 
A:  Yes.  
 
Q:  -- and I'll be asking you mo
re questions about that later.
 
A:  Okay.  In 1938, I men
tioned my  father had customer
s from Germany, from Italy, 
from Hungary, Austria, who have heard of th
e quality and the, the design styling that he 
was known for; and this woman came up fro
m Berlin, and she cam
e to my father's 
jewelry salon to  buy some jewelry, and she 
bought nice amount, and she came back every 
year to buy more jewelry.  And 
in 1940 -- I'm not sure if it wa
s '40 or '41, he brought up a 
little charm bracelet that she owned, and she 
asked my father to clean it up and bring it 
back into ?varible? sh
ape.  And my father, 
when  wo rking on th e bracelet, he noticed that 
there was a tiny Star of David hidden amo
ng the, close to a hundred different tiny 
charms; and when she came back
, my father put the bracelet 
down on the counter, and in 
a way that the Star of David was showing, telli
ng her that he noticed that she had the Star 
of David; and sh e bought mo re jewelry, and she 
told my father that if
 things in the future 
will get really, really rough, and 
you would like to take your fa
mily to Palestine, I'll give 
you a name and a phone number whom to call, and you can tell him,  if you co me to that, 
who sent you.  My  father thanked her, put th
e paper away in his safe and mo re or less 
forgot about it.  
 
Q:  Do you remember 
what her name was?  
 
A:  No, I do not.  I know one thing that -- 
well, I'm giving away th e punch line, but her 
husband was also executed in Nuremb erg.  
 
Q:  Ah, okay.  
 

A:  He was the, he wasn't, obviously a Jewish person from Romania who was the 
appraiser for the Nazis for all the stolen 
goods and valuables that they stole.  
 
Q:  Okay .  
 
A:  So then I think that progressed, and 
the 1944 march, the Germans entered Hungary 
and occupied it, and life has changed totally. 
 And my father was also conscripted for 
forced labor, and he was -- I mean, they su rmised
 that he'd , they'd  be
 taken to the Russian 
front; and, of course, my  mo ther and him had 
acquired warm winter 
clothing, and he had 
a pair of waterproof boots made for himself 
to go; and he told the shoemaker because in 
those days everything 
was custom made, there was no of
f-the-rack stuff, and that he 
doesn 't want any hobna
ils on those boots.  
 
Q:  Um-hm.  
 
A:  I don't know if you know what a hobnail is.  
 
Q:  Vaguely, yes
 
A:  It's a metal iron, like a cleat.  
 
Q:  Okay .
 
A:  What you do, you hammer it 
into the sole and the heel of 
the boots so when you are in 
grass or in terrain, you will not slip.  
 
Q:  Um-hm.
 
A:  And he had to go in on
 a Saturday, Frid ay even ing everything was delivered; and to  
his greatest anger, the shoemake
r forgot about it and studded 
the bottom of the boots with 
hobnails.  There was nothing he
 could do any mo re to it beca
use it was much too late; so 
he put the boots on, and carryin
g a heavy backpack , he went to
 the railroad station.  And 
over there the platform is not in level with 
the steps, but he had to climb up on th e three 
or four steps to the train; and as he was cl
imbing up, he slipped 
on those iron steps and 
twisted out because of the weight of the ba
ckpack, and he was hanging on his one arm, 
and that's where he br
oke his collar bone.  
 
Q:  Oh, okay, okay.  
 
A:  But he went in about an hour's train ride
 away, and he went to the sergeant there and 
said to him what, told him what happened; a
nd th e sergeant asked him, You want to come 
in here to the military hospita
l or you want to go back to 
Budapest and have your own 
docto r treat you?  And he said, Of course.  I 
want to go back to Budapest and have my  
docto r treat me.  And he came back, and to 
my mother's greatest 
amazement -- I mean, 
the poor thing was heartbroken wh en he left
 and couldn't stop sobbing and crying; and he 
came back, and, of co urse, he was put into  
a cast, and he got six week of furlough.  
 

Q:  Okay .  
 
A:  And when the cast was taken off after 
five weeks and he was flexing his arm and 
moving it and maybe two or three days befo re 
he had to  go back, my  mo ther told him, Do 
you remember that woman who gave you th at 
phone numb er and that name?  I mean, let's 
see what could happen, I mean, let's try it.  
Maybe the guy won't even
 be there.  So my 
father -- they were looking in the safe, a
nd my father found it; and he made the phone 
call, and he got an appointment 
for the following day.  The only
 thing he was told that to 
cover up the star when you come to the building.  
 
Q:  Because he was already forced 
to wear a star at that point?  
 
A:  Oh, yes.  What was it, maybe a month af
ter the Germans came in we had, everybody 
had to wear stars,  yellow stars.  
 
Q:  Right.  
 
A:  And he went there, and as he tu rned
 the co rner, he stopped cold because it was 
Gestapo Headquarters.  And he
 said, Well, for a minute, I was thinking, it's a trap.  
Finally he said, You know, what's the differenc
e?  If I'm going in  here, I'm going back  to 
the army , you know, the forced 
labor unit.  So  he went in
, and they waited, ma de him 
wait an hour, and then  he saw the man; and he
 told them he has a family and he has 11 
people that he would like to bring into his 
group; and the guy gave
 him a name from the 
Jewish Committee to see and tell the person th
at he sent my  father over and he should 
take care of him.  
 
Q:  What, what was the name?  
 
A:  I'll be honest with you, I don'
t know because there were several -- 
 
Q:  Right.  
 
A:  -- that later came out.  There were five 
or seven different people handling th e group.  
 
Q:  Um-hm.
 
A:  It was a woman, that's about the only 
thing I can recall.   Q:  Hansi Brand?  
 
A:  I don't know wh ether it was her or her assi
stant.  I'll be honest with you, I don't know 
because my father wa
s not giving out names.
 
Q:  Right.
 
A:  He was not speaking of names.  He just
 mentioned that it was a woman or whatever.  
 
Q:  And do you know wh
o at Gestapo Head quarters your father spoke to?  
 

A:  No, that's  the same thing, I don't know. 
 If you have a list of all those that were 
executed and convicted in Munich, his name w
ill be there.  It's not a German -- I mean, 
it's a German-Jewish sounding name.  
 
Q:  Okay, okay.  
 
A:  We used to have -- actually my father 
after the war got a manuscript from one of the 
memb ers of the group of seve
n who were handling it, his 
name was Engineer Biss or 
Bliss (ph).  
 
Q:  Okay, okay.  
 
A:  He gave my  father a typed copy of that
, and they  became very friendly in  Sw itzerland 
and Œ 
 
Q:  Do you still have that?  
 
A:  No, I don't, I don't.  I don't know what ha
ppened to  it.  We were moving around, and I 
don't really knowwh
at happened to it -- 
 
Q:  Sure.  
 
A:  -- unfortunately.  
 
Q:  Sure.  
 
A:  It was actually, it was the 
history of the entire Kasztner 
 
Group.  
 
Q:  Oh, that would be
 so interesting.  
 
A:  I know, I know. It was written in German 
and -- but I think part of it, part of it was 
also included in the book Jews for Sale.
 
Q:  Okay .
 
A:  Yeah.
 
Q:  Okay. Okay. So, 
anyway, your father got the na
me of someone to go see.  
 
A:  Yes.  And he went there, and there 
was a, thousands of pe
ople waiting outside the 
build ing; and when  my  father told him who se
nt him there, he went right in; and th en 
when he talked to the people,
 they said, Well, whom do y
ou have, you, y
our wife, your 
children?  And he said, No , I have 11 people.
 They said, You're o u t of your mind, there's 
no su ch thing.  And he said, Well, such and su
ch told me that it's 
okay.  So what they 
said, well, okay, you said th
e magic word, used the right name, and they did accept 11 
people.  And, of course, they 
told my  father that he would have to pay, and it has to be 

either in Persian rugs, known artists' paintings, 
jewelry, diamonds.  No money, they didn't 
accept any money.
 
Q.  Right.  
 
A:  So my father paid 
what they  asked, and Œ 
 
Q:  In jewelry, I take it?  
 
A:  In diamonds, yes.  And we
 were told four, three days la
ter, I think, three days later, 
that everybody should pack a 
suitcase; and they didn't want 
to let us out, and in those 
days every build ing, Jewish building had -- we
ll, what would you call it, like a ?kapo? -- 
 
Q:  Um-hm
 
A:  -- that he was, he was a Gentile man who 
was responsible for every pair of shorts or 
socks or handkerchiefs that the Jews owned, 
he had to make a inventory and turn  in the 
entire list; and he didn't want to
 let us out from the building. 
 So my father went to see 
him, and he said, Look, I have these papers he
re that we are ordered to  be deported; and 
if you don't want to let us out, we'l l thank 
you because we won't ha
ve to go and then the 
Germans will come.  S o  that scared him, and 
he said, Go, go, go.  so we went, and we 
were collected in a yard of 
a synagogue on the outer borough
s; and we stayed there for a 
day and a half, and then we we
re put on, on the cattle wagons
; and we were traveling for, 
for I think it was six or seven days.  The train was -- and the train actually stopped on the 
border of Au stria for two days because th
e negotiations between,
 the group who was 
negotiating with the Nazis broke down , and 
they -- the leadersh
ip wanted to get 
assurances where we were going 
because at the border they di
dn't  have a destination, and 
maybe two or three months befo re us there wa
s another group also did the same thing.  
And at the border they stopped, and in stead of 
Osterreich that is in Austria, they were 
shipped by mistake to Auschwitz, 
and they were all killed.  So
 our leader, he knew about 
it, and they were -- he wanted to get a de
finite answer before he was willing to, you 
know, give any mo re of the loot, so to speak, 
to the Nazis.  And then, then after two days, 
it was cleared, and we head
ed for Bergen-Belsen.  
 
Q:  So when  you, wh
en  you left Budapest on the train Œ 
 
A:  Yeah.  
 
Q:  -- what month was that?  
 
A:  That was in June.
 
Q:  In June, okay.  And, and what were th
e conditions like on the train, was it crowded?  
 
A:  Yes, it was the same.  Yes, o f course it was crowded, yes.  I think there were, if I 
remember, now this I cannot vou
ch for, we were either 80 or
 90 people to the wagon.  
 

Q:  Okay .  
 
A:  And we had a bucket a
nd, and, and that was it.  
 
Q:  And did you have ad
equate food or drin k?  
 
A:  Well, e v erybody was bringing 
food with themselves, so, you know -- 
 
Q:  Right.  
 
A:  -- you ate your own.  Yo
u were not getting any from whoever was in charge of the 
train.  
 
Q:  And did you know the name Kasztner at th
at point?  Did you know that he was one of 
the organizers of this?  
 
A:  I think, I think -- my parents definitely did -- 
 
Q:  Okay .  
 
A:  -- but I don't know it for, my  brot
her and I knew who Kasztner was.  
 
Q:  And when you left Budapest on the tr
ain, did you know wh
ere you were going?  
 
A:  No -- 
 
Q:  Okay .  
 
A:  -- we did not.  Oh, we thought we were
 going through Romania to, to Palestine.  
 
Q:  Okay .  
 
A:  That's  what we were told.  
 
Q:  Okay.  Okay.  
 
A:  We were not -- they did not talk about any concentration camp. 
 
Q:  Okay, and just to go ba
ck for a minute, so in genera
l before March 1944 was life 
relatively normal?  
 
A:  Relatively, relatively.  I mean, you kno
w, as far as us child
ren were concerned, 
besides beaten up once and a wh ile on the street
, we led a normal, we led a normal life.  
We went hiking with Jewish Boy Scou
ts and, and -- yes, more or less -- 
 
Q:  Were you -- 
 
A:  You know, go to  the movies and --  
 
Q:  -- still able to go to school?  
 

A:  Well, the thing was that there was a curfew.  
 
Q:  Okay .  
 
A:  So, you know, we could go out I thi
nk from, if I recall, from 11:00 to 1:00.  
 
Q:  Okay .
 
A:  Because there were no more
 schools left 
open any time.  
 
Q:  Okay, so you weren't in school any more at that point?  
 
A:  No, no.  
 
Q:  And so things chan
ged pretty abruptly afte
r the Germans came in ?  
 
A:  Oh, very abruptly, very
 abruptly.  I mean, you know, you had -- many times, not 
many times, a lot of times they
 closed down a street, and ev
erybody on that street was 
taken under doorways and ch ecked that they 
were Jewish or not.  
They were looking if 
they were circumcised or not.  
 
Q:  And did you have to m
ove like to a new house?  
 
A:  No, we did not, that came later.  
 
Q:  Okay, that came later.  
 
A:  That came later.
 
Q:  That came after you had already left Œ 
 
A:  Yes, right.
 
Q:  -- and they started concen trating people?  
 
A:  Yes, yes.
 
Q:  So -- and how were you, ho
w was your father able to ma
ke a living at this point?  
 
A:  He was not.  I mean, he couldn't -- he ha
d to turn  in mo st of his inventory to the 
Hungarian government.  
 
Q:  But he managed to save some things?  
 
A:  Well, they, they -- we fo
und out that they were, they
'd hidden some of the stuff. 
 
Q:  Right, which he then later used Œ
 
A:  Yes.  
 
Q:  -- to pay for passage?  
 

A:  Yes, yes, right.  
 
Q:  Right, right.  So  did you know anything ab
out the other people who were on the train?  
 
A:  No, we didn't  know anybody.  
 
Q:  Okay, okay.  
 
A:  On the entire train there was one other gu
y that I later on found 
out once we were in 
Switzerland that he went to the same gymnasium a grade higher than  I did.  
 
Q:  Okay .  
 
A:  That was the only thing that I --  
 
Q:  And after March 1944, were you aware of
 the stuff that was happening outside of 
Budapest, the concentration and deportation?
 
A:  Yes, because, as I said, because of th
e people who were coming to my father for 
helpŒ 
 
Q:  Okay .  
 
A:  -- to further enable them 
to, to, you know, travel out of 
-- they were all going to ItalyŒ 
 
Q:  Right.
 
A:  -- because things in Italy were not quite as bad.  
 
Q:  And did you know, do you rememb er at wh
at point you realized what Auschwitz was 
and what it meant?
 
A:  Well, no, not by name.  
 
Q:  Okay .  
 
A:  But my father to
ld the story that those people who came from Poland, a couple of 
them who had escaped from Au
schwitz, or an yhow some concentration camp, and they  
mentioned, they mentioned th
at they are killing the Jews 
and gassing them
 and, and -- 
 
Q:  And so your father
 had heard of that?  
 
A:  We had heard of that, but somehow it wa
s not given the full credit that, you know, it 
deserved because they said, Th
at's impossible.  I mean, how 
can people do this thing to 
children; and, and, and, you know, the storie
s were so horrific that
 some people doubted 
it that they were true, and th en some of th
em said that, you know, 
these people are also 
embellishing on things so
 you give them more money to es
cape and all this and all that; 
but as it turned out later on, they did not embellish on it.  
 

Q:  That's  right, yes.  So  did you or any of 
your family members at 
any point in time ever 
meet Kasztner or --                
                          
 
A:  No.  
 
Q:  -- Joel or Hansi Brand 
or any of these people?  
 
A:  No.  My father only met, I don't know w
ho th e people were at the Jewish Committee.  
 
Q:  Okay.  Okay.  Let me see here.  
 
A:  We have a -- he did meet, I mean we, Eichmann once.  
 
Q:  Oh, did you?  
 
A:  I mean, we didn't  know who he was, but 
at the Bergen-Belsen. Because what they had 
done in Berg en-B elsen, when all, the first 
group of 370 people left, 
they kept back one 
member fro m each family to have as a hosta
ge until the negotiations were complete.  
 
Q:  Okay .  
 
A:  And one of my  aunts was held back , and 
the other aunt who was her sister said that 
she is staying with her, she woul
d not leave her alone there.  And, of course, when we got 
to the embarkation point, the trai
n spur, the count did not jive -- 
 
Q:  Right
 
A:  -- because they were having -- they 
had a roll call, an d her name came up, and 
nobody answ ered.  
So my  father stepped out, and he to
ld him that -- I don't know if it was 
Eichmann or not.  In my mi
nd's memo ry it couldn't have been
, but it was of an equal rank 
-- that she stayed with 
her sister; and th is guy pulled out 
his gun, poin ted it at my father 
and started screaming at him 
that, you know, What do you 
think you're doing?  Who do 
you think you are?  You can't -- anyhow, afte
r he berated him and screamed, I mean, we 
were afraid they were going to 
shoot him.  At that time we di
dn't k n ow that the Germans, 
there was no such thing, they 
had to account for everybody, so
 he wouldn't have shot; but 
they sent an SS guar
d back to th e barracks, and he br
ought back my  aunt pulling her by 
her hair, and then we lo
aded onto the trains.  
 
Q:  So were all of the 11 
people family members?  
 
A:  Yes.  
 
Q:  Okay .  
 
A:  They  were my  father's brother and his 
wife and two daughters and my  mo ther's two 
sister s.  
 

Q:  Okay .  Okay .  And do you, do you rememb
er there was a point where they traveled, 
the train traveled through Linz? 
 
A:  Yes, we did, and we got disinfected th
ere.  And the wo rd spread  around th at, you 
know, they were going to kill 
us because that's how they 
do it with the showers.  
 
Q:  Right.  And, and that really, people were fearful.  
 
A:  Yeah, right, right.  Some of them were
 really panicking; but
, you know, they just 
made everybody take all their 
clothes off, and they went to 
inspection, and, and the long 
hairs were all sheared, and you were sprayed 
in the, wherever hair, under the arms and 
the pubic area with whatever kind of a Œ- 
 
Q:  DDT?  
 
A:  Whatever it was, y es.  
 
Q:  Okay , and what did you think wh
en you arrived in Bergen-Belsen?  
 
A:  Well, there was nothing much
 to think, but we knew that 
this was a camp.  I mean, we 
saw the barbed wires, the wa
tch towers and the other inma
tes, and -- but we were, we 
didn't  have to do any work.  As a matter of 
fact, we were, to one side of us they were 
Belgian Jews and th e other side there were Fr
ench Jews, and, and they were, they were 
not allowed to talk, of course, because th
e guards were walking the perimeter.  
 
Q:  So you were kind of set aside?  
 
A:  What?  
 
Q:  You were kind of isolated or set aside?  
 
A:  Yeah.  I mean, we were in
 an enclosure with two barracks,
 and they tried to motion to 
us with their hands that, you know,
 this is the end; but we didn't
 have to wear a star there.  
 
Q:  Okay.  And -- 
 
A:  So we were not, we were not there like Jews.  
 
Q:  Could you wear 
your own clothes?  
 
A:  Yes, yes, we did.  Yes, we did.  As a 
matter of fact, we had th
e, we had Teitelbaum in 
our group, and he had, of cour
se, a long beard and a peyos; 
and the group leader said, you 
know, do something with your 
beard.  He would not cut it off, but he wore a scarf, you 
know, like when  you have tooth ache, and he
 tied up his beard that way so it was not 
overly obvious.  
 
Q:  Okay, and did you feel lik
e, I mean, because or
iginally you had so
rt of thought you 
were going to Palestine Œ 
 

A:  Yeah, well.  
 
Q:  -- did you feel like you 
were betrayed in any way? 
 
A:  Well, we didn't know wh at to think, we di
dn't know what to think.  I'll be honest with 
you, there were all kinds of rumo rs.  As usua
l, in all these places there is rumors and 
rumors and rumors and -- 
 
Q:  What kind of rumors?  
 
A:  I mean, you know, all kinds, that this is
 it, we're not going to go anywhere and th e 
negotiations mu st have broken
 down and we're going to be
 just, we're handed over to 
them on a platter, and this kind of stuff
 
Q:  But were you aware of sort of the ove
rarching deal making that was going on?  
 
A:  No.  
 
Q:  No.  
 
A:  No, that was in secret.  
 
Q:  That's  something you learned later?  
 
A:  Yes.  Once, you know, th
e whole thing came to light.  
 
Q:  But you were certai n ly aware that the wa
r, that the Germans were  losing the war?  
 
A:  Well, yes, because we saw the bombers 
flying over during the day; and every time 
that happened, we were told we had to
 move, get back into the barracks.  
 
Q:  Okay .  
 
A:  The same thing happened when a new tr
ansport came.  I mean
, you know, you saw 
looking out the window because 
you would not be able to st
and outside, but diagonally 
looking to the main road, we 
saw these thousands of women, 
some, some of them in rags 
and dragging, and, you 
know, and I would not call it walking any more.  
 
Q:  Like a death march?  
 
A:  No, not death march but someone -- the 
people who were, who were extremely tired 
and exhausted, so they could have been in
 a transport that was on the way maybe for a 
week or 10 days or whateve
r.  I mean, that's -- we onl
y surmised, we didn't know.  
 
Q:  Right.  
 
A:  But from the shape that they
 were in, we saw that they didn't co me from an y party.  
 
Q:  Right, right.  Bergen-Belsen ended up
 receiving thousands and thousands of --  
 

A:  Yes, yes.  
 
Q:  -- people from other -- 
 
A:  Every three, four days 
there was a group walking by.  
 
Q:  And so what did you do, 
you weren 't forced to work?  
 
A:  Well, most of the time, well, most of th
e time we were standing in line for roll call Œ- 
 
Q:  Oh, okay.
 
A:  -- sometimes for two, three, three and a 
half, four hours before they came, rain or 
shine, you know.  
 
Q:  And did your parents try to sort of comf
ort you or give you a
ny schooling or did you-
- 
 
A:  No, no, no, they  did not.
  I me an, there was, you know, 
no need for that, no time for 
that really.
 
Q:  They  were just trying to  be kept alive.  
 
A:  Just about, just about, yes.  I mean, yo
u know, in the mo rning you stood in  line for 
that black coffee that you got. 
 Once a week they gave you a 
loaf of bread.  At lunchtime 
you got some -- well, I would call it slop be
cause potato peelings and, and th e carrot 
peelings and actually, what you call it, pois
on ivy, that was cooked into the soup. 
 
Q:  Oh!   
 
A:  Well, I mean, you know; and but there wa
s still, for the first tw o or three months 
everybody still had a little bit of their food left.  
 
Q:  Okay .  
 
A:  A little bit, I mean a little, 
you know, some extra crackers
 or something like that.  
 
Q:  And did you have any pe
rsonal possessions with  you, y
ou know, photographs or Œ- 
 
A:  Yes, sure.
 
Q:  Okay .  
 
A:  Sure, sure.
 
Q:  And do you still have those?  
 
A:  Yes, I do.  That was another thing that 
I was able to save because when we left the 
camp to go to -- before they pu
t us across the Swiss border, we
 were searched for all the 
papers.  As a matter of fact, Dessi Dorant (ph) from the 
Metropolitan Opera was in our 

group also, he was a bass baritone; and he 
had all of his photographs with him from the 
operas that he was in, I mean, it was his portfo
lio; and they wanted to take that, and he 
begged th em and he begged them; and an o
fficer came over, he says, All right, let him 
keep it.  So he did. Bu t what you had to 
do, you had to empty th
e wagons one by one.  
When we got to the Swiss border, there was 
maybe a table, I would say, I don't really 
know, maybe, maybe, maybe a hundred  or 200 fe
et long tables one next to th e other, and 
behind it soldiers; and you had 
to unload th e wagon with all 
your belongings and put it in 
a row and then put it up on a 
table one by one, and they , they 
took whatever paper, prayer 
books, ?truins?, if somebody ha
d a small Torah, they just took all that.  And I said to my  
mo m that put all the photographs in one bag. 
 It was a, those were
 like, you know, like 
travel bags Œ- 
 
Q:  Um-hm.  
 
A:  -- and she did; and I was putting up the st
uff in two rows, they were in two rows, one 
checked, one to be check
ed; and I put up the bags in orde
r to have it examined, and while 
I was doing that, I kicked the ba
g with the photographs over to
 the already checked bag.  
 
Q:  Oh, okay, okay.  
 
A:  And then  I told my  brother, You put up th
e stuff; and I started taking the stuff back 
into the wagon from the check
 poin t.  That's  how we saved the photographs.  
 
Q:  That's  how you saved the photographs.  
 
A:  But I interestingly, I had a diary from ou
r Stay in Bergen-Belsen written, I would say, 
microscopic size on a, I would say, four by th
ree piece of papers; and in my attempt to 
save the pictures and being so busy, I put th
em in -- I had knee socks on, and I put them 
inside my socks; and I forgot about it, and 
one of the soldiers noticed it; and I remember 
he said, Wh at does this young guy have here
 in his socks.  And so they took it.  
 
Q:  So they took it.  Oh, that's unfortunate.  
 
A:  Yeah.  Oh, I felt heartbroken Œ- 
 
Q:  I imagine, I imagine.  
 
A:  -- because it was a daily diary.  So, 
anyhow, that's  how we got to Switzerland.
 
Q:  And so how long were 
you in  Bergen-B elsen then?  
 
A:  If I recall, we were, we move
d to Switzerland end of September.  
 
Q:  And did you know that's  where you were going?  
 
A:  No, no, we did not.  
 

Q:  They  just put you on a train and said -- 
 
A:  Right.  I mean, don't forgot the allies we
re advancing already, so they went in a little 
bit circumvent, circum -- circuitous way to
 reach Basel; but, you know, it was whenever, 
some time we were stalle
d on an  open track.  
 
Q:  And how long did it take 
you to get to Sw itzerland?  
 
A:  I don't know, two days maybe.  
 
Q:  Okay .  
 
A:  Two and a half days.  
 
Q:  And it mu st have been a big relief.  
 
A:  Well, I can tell you this, wh
en we pulled into Basel, and I 
 
was standing in the doorway of the trai
n, and there was a Red Cross woman on th e 
platform, I remember many of them, but this one 
said to me, Please be careful, please be 

careful, because the train was still moving; and 
that struck me, the first person, stranger 
who really showed some concern.  So -- but
 it was certainly a happ
y day, and then we 
were treated to a great meal.  I mean, great m
eal, it was pasta and cheese, but to us it was, 
you know _____.  
 
Q:  Sounds good after 
carrot shavings and --  
 
A:  Yeah, yeah
 
Q:  So, so where did you liv
e, was it like a D P  camp?  
 
A:  No, it was a refugee camp.  We were take
n to Montreaux to the hotel.  Hmm, what's  
the name of the hotel?  Sorry, escapes my  mind.  But it was a fantastic view from, on the 
Lake of Geneva, and that, that, that -- Bellev u
e, Bellevue, that was the name of the hotel. 
 
Q:  And how long did 
you stay there?  
 
A:  We were in quarantine for 30 days.  
 
Q:  And given medical care and -- 
 
A:  Yeah, they had a doctor there; but, I me
an, we had a doctor amongst our people also.  
So they, they opened
 a little office, and then if you 
had something was hurting you or 
something, you went to see them.  
 
Q:  Okay .  
 
A:  And in the door there was a S w iss sold
ier with a rifle guarding us; and it's a known 
fact that the Swiss rifles are very long.  
When, when -- I would say, well, five feet, 

maybe.  And my father, we went to one of the 
soldiers and said, Is this a good rifle?  And 
he said, This is the best, 
it hasn 't killed anybody, so.  
 
Q:  And so how long did 
you stay in Switzerland?  
 
A:  We stayed in Switzerland until 1948.  
 
Q:  And you were in a refug
ee camp that whole time or Œ- 
 
A:  Not the whole time.  My brother and I we
re in a school learni
ng English and French  
for about a year and a half; and my  parents we
re, were first sent to Randa, that's right 
under the Matterhorn in a tiny Alpine village; a
nd that was a real miserable spot.  It was 
cold, and, and th ere was no heating at night in
 those old hotels.  What they did in the 
winter, they took these warm water 
bottles, and they slept with it.  
 
Q:  And did you, did your family want to 
immigrate to the U.S. from the beginning Œ- 
 
A:  Sure.  
 
Q:  -- did they ever think of Palestine or --  
 
A:  Sure, sure, he was able to use his old visa number.  
 
Q:  Oh, okay.
 
A:  That _____+ I don't know how many thousands.  
 
Q:  And he never thought about Palestine or -- 
 
A:  No, he did not
 
Q:  -- or going back to Hungary?
 
A:  No, no.  Well, he went b
ack to Hungary in 1946
 to see what was left, and he was able 
to bring out his tools and, and other things
, and, and so he was able to work  in 
Switzerland in a jewelry shop.  
 
Q:  And where has -- where had his tools been stored?  
 
A:  In his, in his shop.  
 
Q:  They were never looted  or anything like that?  
 
A:  No, that was sealed  and left intact.
 
Q:  Oh, okay.  
 
A:  The only thing that later on by 1967 -- I'
m sorry, 1947 they cut 
the apartment and the 
business in two, and they put in so
me other people in half of it.  
 

Q:  And did he ever try to get reparations for anything?  
 
A:  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  We 
did, and we got $200 worth.  
 
Q:  You got how much?  
 
A:  $200.  
 
Q:  Oh, geez.  Well.
 
A:  But he was, as I said, he was able to br
ing out his tool set, and he came with another 
lucky thing, he came and got out 
the last day of his permit.  
 
Q:  Oh, wow.
 
A:  He was able to find a transpor
t to, to go back to Switzerland.  
 
Q:  Okay .  
 
A:  And he brought his 
tools, he brought some winter clothing and 
 
stuff, whatever he thought.  So, as I said, he 
had his tools, and he was able to work, and 
they were happy to have him.  One of the 
comp anies that hired him he did wo rk before 
the war, and, you know, they to
ok him on as a jeweler, and he was able to -- but he didn't 
like it because he had to liv
e off alone by himself.  
 
Q:  And so he didn't --
 so youdidn't think ab out 
staying in Switzerland?  
 
A:  No, I don't think we could ha ve.  They  wouldn't let you.  
 
Q:  Okay .  
 
A:  As a matter of fact, by 1
947 they were, they 
were pushing you to, you know, get out, 
get out.  
 
Q:  And what -- so you took a ship?  
 
A:  Yes.  
 
Q:  What was the name of the ship?  
 
A:  The ship was Queen Elizab
eth the -- Queen Elizabeth.  
 
Q:  Okay , and when  did you, when  did you take, make the journey to the U.S.?  
 
A:  We arrived in New York  in the 1948 bliz
zard.  Yes.  I mean, 
it, it -- all we had was 
just summer clothing because 
in Montreaux it was a very ba
lmy climate, so we had to 
wait till our stuff arrived.  And, interestingly, when we arrived, we did not know that 

under those snow mounds on th e streets th
ere were cars, and they  were burning th e 
garbag e on the streets and ev erything.  
 

Q:  Okay.   
 
A:  My father wanted to go -- if he could 
have gone back  the next
 day, he would have 
gone back .  
 
Q:  Right.  Was it a hard adjustment?  
 
A:  For them it was because th
ey didn't  speak English.  
 
Q:  But you had been learning Eng
lish, you and y
our brother?  
 
A:  Yes, yes, my brother and I were pre
tty fluent, and it was the King's English.  
 
Q:  Right, right.  And where did the rest
 of the family go to, all to the U.S.?  
 
A:  They went back
 to Budapest, no.  
 
Q:  Oh, they went back to Budapest.
 
A:  One daughter of one of my  cousin 's got 
married in Switzerland, an
d she stayed there.  
 
Q:  Okay .  
 
A:  The other one, the rest of 
them went back to Budapest.  
 
Q:  And stayed there?  
 
A:  Yes.  
 
Q:  It's always interesting to th ink why pe
ople would go back.  A: 
 Well, look, my  uncle, 
he was a furrier, he did not have anything 
that he was out talking without knowing the 
language, he felt that he could su rvive. My  tw
o aunts, they said, What
 do we want to do 
there?  I mean, you know, we 
don't have children, so why 
not go back, you know, where 
we are familiar with the place 
and the -- even after what ha
s happened, we don't really 
have a choice.  
 
Q:  And do you know if they
 felt any resentment or reperc
ussions because a lot of Jews 
that went back to -- well, especially to
, you know, Po land and places like that Œ- 
 
A:  Yeah.  
 
Q:  -- they weren't treated very well.  
 
A:  Well, that I do not know, I'll be honest w
ith you.  I know they, 
they, they had a lot of 
fighting with  the people who were put in to  th
e other half of the ap
artment at that time; 
but, finally, they, they moved 
out of there, and they got 
another apartment somewhere 
else.  But other than that, no, I do not know.  
 
Q:  And have you ev er be
en back  to Budapest?  
 

A:  Yes, I have because, as I said, I visited 
my aunt a number of times because she was, 
you know, she was in her early 
90's already, and she kept -- I talked to her more, maybe, 
of course, you know, we sent money every m
onth for them to survive; and wh en  her 
sister passed away, she sort of gave up, and 
she said, What the heck
 am I living for?  I 
mean, what's the life?  It
's meaningless, et cetera, et cetera; and I said, Well, listen, you 
just hold it together, and next summer I'll come
 and visit you; but y
ou have to , you know, 
make do.  So  she did, and ev ery other year I 
talked to her, and I said
, I 'm co min g , so  ho ld  
it together, and, you know, just -- so I was 
hoping that I kept her alive for a while.  
 
Q:  That's  great.
 
A:  But after she passed away, I went onl
y back once, and I took my children and 
grandchildren with me to show them the house 
I was born and, and to take -- we went to 
the cemetery, and, you know.  
 
Q:  Right, right.  
 
A:  And that was it, and I don't feel like going back  any mo re.  
 
Q:  Again.  
 
A:  Unfo rtunately, I always told  them that
, you know, the place hasn 't -- is beautiful and 
all that, but the faces haven't changed.  
 
Q:  Well, the political situation there is -- 
 
A:  Right.  I mean, this was also
 during the communist, and, you know -- 
 
Q:  Yeah.  So your fam
ily stayed in New York?  
 
A:  Yes.  
 
Q:  Okay , and never went to any place else?  
 
A:  No.  
 
Q:  Okay .  And your father reestablished his busin ess?  
 
A:  Yes, yes.  Eventually, yes, right.  
 
Q:  And you became an artist?  
 
A:  No, I was, I was -- I only started 
-- well, I mean, I was designing jewelry.  
 
Q:  Oh, okay.
 
A:  But my brother retired five
 years ago, he, he had it; and 
   I -- you know, we closed 
the shop, and I just have now a small studio,
 and that's  where I do my  thing and, and 
enjoy wh at I'm doing.  
 

Q:  Good.  And so I'm sure yo
u know that the Kasztner rescue 
mission even to this day is 
somewhat controversial.  
 
A:  Yes, I understand.  
 
Q:  And what do you, what do 
you think of that, what do you
 think about it in retrospect? 
 
A:  Well, look, when  the group was formed, we
 did not know the background of it.  After 
the war, it came out that he actually picked
 a select few from th
at is today Cluj, 
Transylvania, and told th
e rest of the people in the ghetto
 that, you know, they 'd  be safe 
and they 'd  be just taken to wo
rk and all that and so  that th
ey should rema
in ?restive?.  
Now, having spoken to the you
nger guys who were from Cluj 
and in the group, they said 
that, you know, what they tried to do is save
 the cream of the crop, all the rabbis, the 
scientists, the, the writers and musicians, what
ever, that that was the 
idea.  And they were 
not -- if they would have picked  mo re people, 
this thing would have never come to a, to 
be.  So that's what we
 were told from them.  
 
Q:  Right.  
 
A:  You know, it's, it's, it's difficult to make
, to find out what exac
tly, what is the true 
story.  
 
Q:  Right.
 
A:  And, I mean, unfortunately, he had to pay for his life.  
 
Q:  Do you remember that?  
Do you rememb er when th at ha
ppened --A:  Oh, sure.  Oh, 
absolutely.  
 
Q:  -- and made the connec
tion with your experience?  
 
A:  Yes.  One of the, one of the offspr
ings from the people from 
that ghetto who killed 
him in Israel. 
 
Q:  Right, right.  
 
A:  Safe revenge.  I mean, did that br
ing his parents back ?  I don't think so.  
 
Q:  No.
 
A:  But, look, there were, there were a number of people, there was someone like this in 
Holland also, who, who everybo
dy thought that he was a Jewish renegade, and he saved 
children, hundreds of them
, from the Nazis by smuggling 
them into Christian homes 
through an orphanag e, so I'm su
re you know ab out it also.  It's
 -- I have the, I have a, a 
DVD on him.  
 
Q:  Oh, okay.
 

A:  So.  
 
Q:  And did you, speaking of movies, have 
you seen there's a movie that came out a 
couple of years ago called "Killing Kasztner"?  
 
A:  No.  
 
Q:  A documentary?  
 
A:  No, I did not see that.  
 
Q:  It's very, very interesting and 
well done, I think, and I would be -- 
 
A:  Where can you get that?  
 
Q:  I'm sure it's availab le on DVD, maybe 
even at a library or something.  You can 
certainly order it.  You have an e-mail; right?  
 
A:  No, I don't.  
 
Q:  Oh, you don't.  
 
A:  I mean I have, but I don't use it.  
 
Q:  Yeah.  I'll send you the information Œ
 
A:  Okay .  
 
Q:  -- through the mail or something, and -- 
 
A:  Because I have the 11 DVD's from the, th
e, the Simon Wiesenthal Center where they 
give the entire history of the Ho locaust.  
 
Q:  Oh, okay.  
 
A:  Starting with Churchill.  
 
Q:  Oh, okay.  Well, this --   
 
A:  But it has no mention of that.  
 
Q:  Yeah.  No.  This film is very inte
resting and well done, so I would recomme nd -- 
 
A:  Yes, I would definitely like to see it.  
 
Q:  And I will send it to you.  
 
A:  Thank you.  
 
Q:  But the -- let's see, my ot
her question was -- okay, just to
 go back  to one question that 
I thought was a little confusing.  
 

A:  Yes.  
 
Q:  The woman who came in
to your father' shop Œ-
 
A:  Yes.  
 
Q:  -- with the Star of David bracelet.
 
A:  Right.
 
Q:  Now, you said her husband
 was executed at Nuremberg?
 
A:  Right.  He was the appraiser for, for th
e SS Order of the Gestapo for all the artwork 
that they have stolen.  
 
Q:  So he was not a Jew?  
 
A:  He was a Jew, that's what we
 were told, his name was Jewish.  
 
Q:  But he was executed after the war?  
 
A:  Yes, yes, in Nuremberg.  
 
Q:  Okay, I'll have to look th
at up.  That's interesting A:  Yeah, yeah, he was a Romanian 
Jew.  
 
Q:  Romanian Jew, okay.  And, let's see, 
and have you ever been -- you know, they do 
have these Kasztner train reunions of these surv
ivors, have you ever been to anything like 
that?  
 
A:  No, I have not, no.  
 
Q:  No.  And then th e final question I have is Œ 
 
A:  Yes.  
 
Q:  -- do you, the photographs that you ha
ve that you -- do you still have them?  
 
A:  Yes.  
 
Q:  Would you be willing to 
loan them to 
the museum?  
 
A:  Sure.  I mean, you know, they're 
photographs, old family photographs.  
 
Q:  That's  okay.  
 
A:  My uncle in his uniform
 in the first world war, you know, that kind of stuff, and 
mostly family shots.  
 
Q:  Okay .  So I might have someone 
get in touch with  you ab out that -- 
 

A:  Okay .  
 
Q:  -- from a different department.  And then
 the note -- I don't suppose you still have the 
note from the safe that 
had the phone number?  
 
A:  No, no.  
 
Q:  That would be a very interesting artifact.  
 
A:  Wouldn't that be, yes, yes.  I would bring th at.  
 
Q:  And how about photographs or artif
acts from your time in Switzerland?  
 
A:  Well, we didn't really have a camera.  
I have maybe one photograph of my self and -- 
well, I have, wait a second, I might have a fe
w with my  cousin and my  brother and then  
another one with a friend.  
 
Q:  Okay .  
 
A:  I might have those.  
 
Q:  Okay , so I'll have someone get in touch 
with you about perhap s loaning th at to us 
because we do collect that type of material.  
 
A:  Yeah, all right.  
 
Q:  So, I guess that's 
about it.  I think Œ- 
 
A:  Yes.  
 
Q:  -- we'v e covered everything.  Than
k you.  You have a fantastic memo ry.  
 
A:  Thank you.  Thank you.  Well, I have to 
repeat a couple of times to my  grandchildren 
because they made it a proj
ect in school to, to Œ-
 
Q:  Oh, okay.
 
A:  It was a home movie that they did.  
 
Q:  Oh, that's great.  
 
A:  Right, right.  
 
Q:  Oh, that's great.  And do 
you have any questions for me?  
 
A:  Not really.  
 
Q:  Okay .  
 
A:  The only question, you 
know, I still don't understand 
what, why th is whole thing 
started out that, oh, ab out three or four years 
ago, even maybe more than that, I went to 

the Holo caust Museum, and I had a piece of 
soap from Bergen-Belsen, and I gave it to 
them, and it was never displayed;
 and when  we went back a y
ear and a half ago, I asked 
them, why, you know, you're 
not displaying it; and they sa
id, Well, you know, there are 
some things that it mi
ght not be what it's cracked up 
to be, that it might not be pure 
Jewish fat like it's stamped.  And I'm also, 
that you have to look, that you have to realize 
that the mu seum has more non-Jewish visitors  than Jewish visitors, and they -- it would 
be too gruesome.  I said, Ho
w can it be mo re gruesome?
 
Q:  Well, you know, the thing is too th at we
 have, we have so ma
ny artifacts and very 
few of them actually e
nd up being on disp lay.
 
A:  I understand that.  Like I questioned 
th em, why, why didn't you display any of the 
lamp shades that use a 
corpse, made out of the tattoos from the prisoners.      
                
                
Q:  Yeah, yeah.  I think it's 
also partly a consideration of
 human remains, like actually 
showing human remai n s.  
 
A:  But they  are showing th em in Europe.  
 
Q:  Yeah.  No, I know.  I wasn 't
 here when the mu seum opened.  
 
A:  Yeah.  
 
Q:  But it was a big, it was a big question whether to Œ 
 
A:  Obviously.  
 
Q:  You know, that they , and they
 decided against it in the end -- 
 
A:  Well -- 
 
Q:  -- because they didn't want to offend, I 
think especially the Or
thodox people.  So, I 
don't know.  I mean, I can't answer 
that.  I don't make the decisions Œ 
 
A:  Yeah.  
 
Q:  -- but those are just a couple of the things I heard.  
 
A:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well -- 
 
Q:  But it's here, it's 
in the collection; right?
 
A:  Pardon me?
 
Q:  The bar of soap is in the collection?
 
A:  No, it's not.  
 
Q:  I mean, it's in our --  
 

A:  Possession, yes.
 
Q:  Yeah.
 
A:  In your possession, yes, because at the 
time they said they 
had one from Au schwitz, 
they had one from Birken
au, but they didn't have one fro
m Bergen-Belsen.  I think they 
did have one from Dachau. 
 
Q:  Well, okay, okay.
 
A:  Anyhow.
 
Q:  Thank you very mu ch fo r taking th e time.  
 
A:  Well, my pleasure.  
 
Q:  And I guess they will -- this 
is the first actually one of th
ese interviews I've ever done, 
but I assume they will send you, you kn
ow, a copy of it at some point.  
 
A:  I would appreciate that.  
 
Q:  Okay .
 
A:  I would appreciate that.  
 
Q:  Okay.  Well, it was 
great to talk to you.  
 
A:  Thank you very mu ch.  
 
Q:  Okay.  Bye-bye.  
 
A:  Bye.
