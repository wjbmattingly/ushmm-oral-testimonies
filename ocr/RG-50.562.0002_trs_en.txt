A: It was the only a-au thority th at I would 
-- th-the Hungarians would listen. A rabbi 
wouldn™t -- I mean, we -- first of all, we didn™t have a rabbi. 
Q: That™s right, yeah. 

A: And the 
shochet 
had -- was useless really, becaus
e he -- aya -- he had no a -- no 
authority as such, I mean, a nd even a rabbi, those days an
ti-Semitism was really starting 
to get, you know, noticed. I al
so remember after the Hungar ians came in, this colonel 

wanted all the Jews -- males 13 and up to co
me over for a meeting. And he started to 
lambaste everybody. The Jews are the onl
y ones who are non-pr
oductive, non -- no -- 
nothing. The -- everybody wo rk s on Saturd ay 
except the Jews, and the Jews better start 

working on Saturday. So all of 
a sudden, I was selec ted t o  go
 and get the horses, and go 
haul some lumb er, and stu -- o-on 
Shabbos
, you know, and a couple of stores had to be 
opened up, because most of the 
Jews were what do you call, ha
ve stores, or some kind of 
a -- we -- w e -- we were very -- I think about 
two or three families h a
d land. So that was -
- and after that, you know, it kind of dwindled
 down a little bit, but 
the next Saturday -- it 
was Friday afternoon. So this guy was a re
al firebrand, and as far as Jews were 
concerned. 

Q: But people didn™t work  on Sunday.
 Ch ristians didn™t 
work on Sunday. 
A: I we -- we -- Sunday, by law, you cou -- yo
u™re not allowed to wo
rk, okay? So mash --  
Q: So whether you were Je
wish, or not Jewish, you weren™t allowed to wo rk ? 

 
Interview with AlanKalish  
 
October 24, 2003 
 

 
31
A: Correct. But we -- we would go work in th
e fields on Sunday, and we a -- they always 
used to light us up, you know, th e police, 
but no-nothing ever happen ed. No th ing ever 
happened .  
Q: And why do you think -- I know this ma
y seem like a funny de
tail, but why do you 
think the priest listened to
 your mo ther? Did -- did he kn
ow her? Was it the to wn™s 
[indecipherable]
 
A: Well, it was a small town, every
body knew everybody
 and they all 
[indecipherable].
 
It was a Catholic priest, and he had a gi
rlfriend there, that -- somebody™s wife, so 

everybody knew about that, you know 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: I see. 

A: She was a ni -- a beautiful woman, yo
u know, and -- but he used to court her. 
Q: I see. So was your mother surprised when
 you came home, when 
you walked in on the 
Shabbos 
dinner? 
A: Yes. 
Q: She was? 
A: Oh yes.

really happy to finally see you.

™re scared, but you know, you figure it™s not 
going to last forever.  

Q: That™s what you thought? 

A: Yeah. Eventu ally they have to let you 
go. Because I was the only Jewish kid over 
there 
[indecipherable]
 

Q: So you didn™t see it as
 anything in particular 
[indecipherable]

Q: Not easy. How were the guards with you in  
Ja wischowit z
, were they very brutal, the 
ka po s
 and the guards? 
A: The 
ka po s
 were sometimes w o rse th
an the gar -- than the 
SS. 
The
 SS
 didn™t get 
involved  too mu ch, only if somebody stepped 
out of line, then they
 came in and they 
really beat you to a pulp. But the 
ka po s
 wasn ™t too gentle either. The 
ka po s
 are mostly 
German Jews, prisoners. And th
ey -- they had certain privile
ges over there, and if a 
young boy came in, they would 
have him their house boy. I 
guess they used them for sex 
and ev erything else, so -- 
Q: Ho -- did -- did you know th ese we
re German Jews, not just German? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: The 
ka po s,
 they were German Jews?

they were brutal, most of them. 
Q: And did you sm-- you assumed that thes
e young boys were being used sexually? 

A: Well, we knew. 
Q: You knew? 
A: We knew. But if the 
ka po
 stepped out of line, th
e Germans took care of. 
Q: And what would it mean to step out of line for those people, do you think? 
A: I -- if he -- I -- I don™t know how to  te
ll you, but if he didn™t fo llow th eir rules, you 
know, gave s -- gave somebody leniency or 
so -- we -- you know, lenient with so mething 
or somebody, then it -- becaus
e he was walking -- always wa
lking around w

hose about 
yay
 long, and if you stepped out of line, or
 he didn™t like you, or whatever, he 
give you a whack over the shoulders,
 or over the head, that -- no mercy. 
Q: So th -- in order 
for them to survive -- 
A: They had to -- 
Q: -- they had to be brutal. 
A: -- brutal. 

Q: Did you understand that then? 
A: No. 
Q: Do you understand it now? 

A: Yes, I understand it now. 

Q: You do? Would you have become a 
ka po
 do you th ink 
A: No. 

Q: Did you have a chan  -- yo
u wouldn™t have done it? 

A: No. 
Q: So in a certain way yo
u don™t understand this. 
A: You try to surviv e, you try to -- not 
-- try not to cross the line because you saw 
somebody who crossed the line of any way possi
ble. And was no mercy. And if they had 
appel -- appel
 was, you know, a roll call, and so
mebody was missing, you stood there 
until that person showed up, and freeze your bu
tt off. And then whoeve
r showed up late, 
God help  you.

uld take the roll call. They would go, you 
know, call out your name, and -- 

Q: Do you recall about 
how long you woul
d have to stand in  roll call? 
A: Most of the time it 
was about a half hour. 
Q: So it wasn™t that -- 

A: Wasn™t that bad. 
Q: -- but it™s pretty cold. 
A: But you -- you wo rked all night long. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: You worked all night long, 
so, you know, you were kind of
 tired, and at eight o™clock 
was 
appel
, you know? And you came in, the first th
ing you had to  do was take a shower, 
because you were all full of coal dust. And 
you went to sleep, 
where it was on a bunk, 
and -- and that was it. 
Q: So you were able to 
take a shower every day? 
A: Ye -- after you come back from the coal mines. 
Q: With soap? 
A: Yes. 
Q: Really, but -- and how did you dry yo
urself? Was there actually a towel?

Q: Did you have dreams, bad dreams? 
A: I don™t remember.

[indecipherable]
 
A: Oh no, no, no, no, 
no, no. It was a section would sayabout six feet or so, and four 
people in a section. 
Q: So were you friends with these people? 
A: No. 
Q: No. Did you ha

of help?ﬂ And we were talki
ng in Yiddish. And I told  him, I says, ﬁWe are over there 
doing nothing, wasting our time. We are a
ll survivors, and we would like to go to 
school.ﬂ So, you know, we were talking back 
and fo rth, he said, ﬁI™ll tell you what. Here 
is the money, buy yourself a 
ticket, go back on the train, 
and I™ll see what I can do.ﬂ Two 
weeks later, we go into 
Geneva
, about a dozen of us or so
. And we ge -- and we went, 
came down to 
Geneva
, and there was a -- a h ouse there, not far from the airport, and I 
don™t rememb er the name, but there was ot
her refugees, but these -- these were not 
survivors, these are people who during the wa
r they ran away and this and that. And we 
were with them, and they were -- some of thos
e went to work, and we went to work also, 
and we were introduced to a scu -- what do you
 call it, to the teachers over there, one of 
them was a  Polish Jew, was a -- h e was a ma t h
 professor, he was really good. And then 
the shop f -- foreman, and we -- we went down
 th ere and started to learn. And a couple 
weeks later, they separated us from that group,
 and just the survivors got a place there, it 
was called 
Hôme de Pregni
, right back of th e United Nati
ons building. And there they 
also had a psychologist, and they had a house 
mo ther, and we went to school, and started 
to learn. And I -- I requested to get a Fren
ch tutor for me because  I wanted to learn 
French in  a hurry . And once I had a knowledg
e of conversational French, I decided to 
register -- it was for the fall seme
ster, in the community college. 
Q: Why did you want to learn Fren ch? 
A: Because that was the language down there. 

 
Interview with AlanKalish  
 
October 24, 2003 
 

 
110
Q: Uh-huh, okay, right. 
A: And I think when  you go 
to school down there, you ha
ve to learn how to  speak 
French. And -- which I did. It was a little ha
rd in the beginning, 
but I mastered the 

language pretty quick . I would s -- I was really
 -- a language I™m really fast to learn. And 
I went to school, and I still went -- and the tutor still was, you know,
 teaching me French, 
and in 
ORT
 I was doing very well. And I™ll tell you,
 they  really taught us basics, and 
precision, how to operate each shop piece of 
equipment, and that™s
 what we did. You 
learn how to do it, and after awhile, they 
separated the top stude
nts, and gave them 
advanced 
[indeciphera ble]
 and I was one of them, was a few of us. And after about a 
year, I was offered to go to 
Vav e y
, they are gonna have a co
llege over there, and oh -- 
teach 
ORT --
 how to teach 
ORT 
students. 
Q: To learn to be an instructor. 

A: I would be an instru -- or 
an instructor. And I said okay,
 but then I got
 worried that 
there is a transport of 50 people, 
United States
 will let them in as lo
ng as their relatives 
are sponsors in the States, they can go.
 And that™s how I got to th e States. 

Q: Let me ask you something. Wh at -- wh

October 24, 2003 
 

 
118
A: Well, yes, but that wasn™t my favorite place to be. 
Q: It wasn™t? 

A: No. Because, first o f all, I was a li -- stay
ing in the living room, and sleeping on the 
couch. That wasn™t the best situation. I had 
no priv acy, and mo st of
 my friends were in 
Manhattan
. So after I don™t know how many weeks, or maybe a month or six weeks, I 
got a hotel room with a friend of mine in 
Manhattan
, on 
Hundred Street
 and 
Broadway
, and we got a room, a beautiful ro
om, and somebody was cleaning it every 
day, and you know, you use the restaurants

to see you go? Did they  --

October 24, 2003 
 

 
119
A: Yes, my  -- really were kind of disappointed
 that I left, but you know, wasn ™t -- wasn™t 
-- wasn™t my way of living. I was up to knowi
ng there™s a little better th
ings in life than 
sleeping on the couch without priv acy. 
Q: Right. And what did your fa
ther™s brothers do? What was -- 
A: Well, one of them owned a bun -- a -- a -- 
a Laundromat, or a cleaning store, stuff like 
that, and they were pretty well off. And they
™re the ones who sent -- it was 350 dollars for 
the trip. And they are the ones who sponsored
 the 350 thousand -- 
350 dollars. The other 
one was -- he was -- you know, those days y
ou didn™t have washing machines, so you 
picked up laundry, an d bring it to the laundry,
 and bah, bah, bah. So
 they weren™t too well 
off, and that™s where I was stay
ing, basically. And wasn™t my 
ideal place, for a real life to 
live. And moving to 
Manhattan
, there was a lot of other friends that I knew, and was 
more accessible to places, and doing things, a
nd I ju -- I -- I really did enjoy it much 
better. Excuse me. 

Q: Did you go to night school ri
ght away to learn English? 
A: First thing, yes. 

Q: First thing. 

A: First thing I did is register to school, an

I used to go to work, and -- fro
m eight to 4:30, and I -- it

really sometimes were 
mo re anti-Semitic than 
anybody else, the blacks. A-And

because of that. I said here

being persecuted, an-and now 
they ™re hating Jews and, you 
know, it does not -- it doesn ™t ma ke any sense. So I lost symp athy.

he was always funny. He was a lousy worker, 
but he was -- I couldn™t get -- ever get mad

Q: Yeah, yeah.

looking fo rward to better yourself. 

Q: Right. 
A: And 
A&P
 that time, well th ey were in 
Brooklyn
, and we were in 
Brooklyn
 also, the 
plant. We installed a lot of equipment over 
there, and they couldn™t make it go, they 
actually got calls all th e tim
e, this is no good, this 
[indecipherable]
 guys didn™t do right, 
and so I would go down there 
and find out what their problem
 is. And little silly things 
that just -- so one day I sa
id, ﬁYou guys are the biggest du
mmies in the world,ﬂ I said. 
ﬁYou can™t figure out what™s wrong over here?ﬂ I says, 
ﬁWhy don™t you get somebody 
over here who -- who will show you how to 
do this?ﬂ He says, ﬁYeah,ﬂ he said, ﬁwhy 
don™t you come to work for us?ﬂ I said, ﬁI will
 not.ﬂ So I said, ﬁI don™t want to work for 
you guys.ﬂ Well, 
[indecipherable]
 they kept calling my wife, they called my mother-in-
law, they found out where 
my mother-in-law lives, and 
bubba
, and ev erybody, they  
bugging me, you know, to -- I 
said, ﬁOkay, I™ll co -- I™ll co
me to work there.ﬂ Meantime 
where I was working, ﬁOh, we™ll make you a 
foreman over here,ﬂ and you -- ﬁdon-don™t 
leave us because you are good wh-what -- what 
you are doing, and blah, blah, blah.ﬂ So I 

said, ﬁWell you guys aren™t paying enough, 
so I™ll go over there.ﬂ And so  I went to 
A&P
 
and I worked over there for ab
out two, or two and a half years. And I read in the paper 
there™s a job really paying well, it was in 19 
-- I think it was in ™52.
 And I took that job,

and it was designing and setting up
 prin ting presses for newspa
pers and magazines. So I 
went for an interview and I got the job, and 
I worked there for -- we
ll, I think it was about 
11 months. In 11 months I made over 9,000 dolla
rs. That time was a lot of money, in ™52. 
So -- but they then decided 
-- the union decided -- and I wasn
™t part of it -- to go on 
strike. And the boss tells me , 
ﬁAl,ﬂ 
he says, ﬁafter the strike, we going to  have to lay off 
almost everybody because we lo
st a lot of business.ﬂ So th
en I went out to -- Monday 
morning I went out for inte
rviews. So I saw there was 
AT & T, Crucible
 
Steel,
 and 
Colgate Palmolive 
had ads. So first I went to 
Co lga t e
, with a line up of about 50 people. 
So I finally got to the line there, and, ﬁO
kay,ﬂ he says, ﬁcome 
on in the engineering 
office.ﬂ I says -- ﬁand I want you to read th
is, showing how you would go about it.ﬂ So I 
said okay. So I went over, and th en they br
ought me in the plant, and in the machine 
shop, and how would you handle
 this, and -- in the plant 
how would you handle this 
[indecipherable]
. I said, ﬁOkay, thank 
you.ﬂ Then I went to 
Crucible Steel, 
and they did 
a -- test me also, and I says
, okay. And then  I went to 
AT & T
, and 
AT & T
 was a lab ,  
and they  said they would hire me, but that
 was about two o™clock in the afternoon, I 
wasn™t too far from the 
A&P
 plant, so I went down there, 
and I went to personnel, I said, 
ﬁI want to talk to my -- 
Olie Turgison
,ﬂ who was my boss with -- before I left. He says -- 
so the guy down  there says, ﬁHe doesn™t want to
 talk to you, you left over here.ﬂ I said, 
ﬁJust call him up and tell him I want to talk 
to him.ﬂ So he came down here, ﬁOh come 
on, I™ll buy you a cup of coff
ee.ﬂ And he asked me, ﬁWhat are you doing?ﬂ I said, ﬁWell I

think I -- I think I got a job at 
Co lgate Palmolive
, th-they pay the most, and they are -- 
and I feel that™s a good compa
ny to work for.ﬂ So he says, 
ﬁWell, how would you like to 
come to work for us?ﬂ I 
said -- I to ld him what 
Colgate
 is paying, and, ﬁIf you guys can 
meet 
Colgate™s 
salary, I™ll come to  work

 he told me he has to talk to the big boss. 
He says, ﬁWhere the heck are you,ﬂ he said
, ﬁyou™re supposed to be working over here 
since eight o™clock in  the mo rning,ﬂ he says, 
ﬁit™s nine o™clock, you should have been

couple of times with 
A&P

house, and my wife says y -- I™m at work. 
Can they  call me at work? And she says, 
ﬁNo.ﬂ she says, ﬁyou give me your phone

ne by then. But I fooled them all. 
Q: Why was it so difficult? 
A: Because was a tough job, it was -- and it wa
s really p -- really poorly  organized, and 
everything else, and the equipment wasn™t ma in
tained properly, so wh
en I got in there I 
started to redesign th e equipment, and build
 my  own equipment, you know, to improve 
everything else. And things star
ted to hum. Pro-Productivity -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- was starting to go up. And the first fe
w months, my wife used to tell me, ﬁWhy 
don™t you take a cot and sleep over there,ﬂ 
she said, ﬁy-you™re always on call. You come 
home, you don™t even  sit down 
to eat, the phone is ringing.ﬂ
 So it took ab out six months, 
and -- and then things started to calm down a
nd straighten out and I got a nice raise after 
six months, and --
 Tropicana 
treated me well. I got promoted -- from there I got 
promoted  to manager of proj
ect engineering. And I was on -- that was job -- best job I 
ever had because I had no responsibility. A
ll I did was critique everybody else™s 
engineering work . I was the manager, and going 
over all the prints and designs, and -- but 
all of a sudden, I was on a golf course, I got a 
call, my  boss wants to see me immediately. 
So my  wife called the golf course up and got 
a message to me I™d better get home. And I 
got home, I said, ﬁWhat™s the ma tter?ﬂ She says, ﬁ
Brent
 wants to t -- see you right away .
