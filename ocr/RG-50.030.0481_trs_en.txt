BERENDINA DIET EMAN 
 November 6, 2003 
 
Q: Goodmorning,Diet. 
 

A: Goodmorning. 

 

Q: It™s nice to see you finally. 

 

A: I™m happy to be here. 

 

Q: Thank you. Wh- What is your name? 

 

A: Well, if you want to know how they bap
tized me , it was Berendina Roelofina Hendrika 
Eman. And I was only five pounds, I 
think that™s a crime to a baby. 
 

Q: Fivepounds? 

 

A: Yeah. I think that™s a crime to a baby. But 
my mom lost her mother when she was 11, and 
then she got a stepmother who brought them 
up, they had five kids, and they got still 
from the second ma rriage. So
 she thought when I was bor
n, and she didn™t think she 
would get -- I was seven years after the other ki
ds. Sh -- I thought I would be the last one, 
so she name d me after her stepmother, Bere
ndina. And then she thought, ﬁI should honor 
my real mother, too, Roelofina.ﬂ And out of
 that second ma rriage she had a baby sister 
that she adored, Hendrika, so I™m 
stuck with thro -- three name s. 
 

Q: So how did Diet come? 

 

A: Now, then -- in the Netherlands, little kids
 always the name  ends in an E, that me ans 
you™re little, that -- they chop that off i 
-- if you™re big. But they called me  Dinie, 
Berendina, Dinie, chopped off. And then, to th
eir big surprise, 13 months later there came  
a little brother, and we were always togeth
er, and one day an aunt
 picked me  up, and I  
was away the whole day, and he was crying 
the whole day, and he just started talking, 
Dietdee, Dietdee, Dietdee, and they didn™t 
know what -- what he wanted. But when I was 
brought back, Dietdee, and then they knew he 
called me  Dietdee, so then I was Dietdee, 
and then it was they co -- chopped off -- you know, so -- 
 

Q: They chopped off the E. 

 

A: -- and -- Diet, and when you 
write it our way, here they call 
me  Diet, so -- because that™s 
how you write it. 
 

Q: But it™s real ly Diet, is it --  
 
A: Now -- in the -- in the Netherlands --

Q: In the Nether lands. 
 

A: -- it™s an E, that™s how you say the E, Diet. 

 

Q: Now you™ve had a number, although I don™t wa
nt the stories associated with it, but 
you™ve had a number of -- of false name s. 
 

A: Oh yeah, a whole bunch. 

 

Q: Yes, ho-how ma ny did you have, three, four? 

 

A: Yeah, I think -- it depends with which group, 
if I thought that my na me  wa s getting -- but 
all of us in the Resistance had false name s. 
 

Q: Falsename s. 

 

A: And with some  I was Toos, and with some
 I was Dinako, that is another abbreviation. 
And then I left there, and I was -- I was nearly
 arrested on the name  
of ar  -- I had to find 
another name again, that they knew my false name . 
 

Q: That™s when you became  -- 

 

A: And then I thought -- the guy who ma de the 
false papers, he said, ﬁWhat do you want to 
be your name?ﬂ I said, ﬁWell, I™ll take the name
 of the queen, Wilhemina .ﬂ And that™s the 
name  I was arrested on, so -- 
 
Q: Right, right. I want to kn
ow some thing about your fa mil
y. You had three siblings, yes? 
 
A: Yes. Two much older, 
that were the big ones, an
d we were the little ones. 
 

Q: AndAlbert? 

 

A: Albert is the youngest. 

 

Q: Is the youngest. So he was the one who was calling you Dietdee, right? 

 

A: Dietdee,yeah. 

 

Q: AndStephana? 

 

A: He is 13 mo nths younger. 

 

Q: He was how much, thir -- thir -- 

 

A: He was 13 months younger. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481

Q: 13months. 
 

A: We are very close, st ill. 

 

Q:  Real l y cl ose. 

 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: And Stephana, Fanny? 

 

A: Stephanie, yeah, Fanny, they say Stephanie.
 No, in the Netherlands you say Stephana, but 
here it would be Stephanie, and then I hada brother after that, and he had an old Dutch 

name , Arjen, A-r-j-e-n, Arjen, it™s a beautiful
 ol d Dutch name . So they had both of one 
name , and then Albert came , and he only ha
s one, and I am stuck with those three.  
 

Q: And what was the difference in
 age between you and Fanny, and -- 
 

A: My oldest sister was eight y
ears older, and then -- so seven 
years with my other brother.  
 

Q: Right. And what was your father™s name ?  

 

A: Gerrit, G-e-r-r-i-t, Gerrit. 

 

Q: Herrit with a G. 

 

A: That™s di fficult to say here, because I th
ink it™s the translation of Gerald, you know. 
 

Q: And your mother™s name? 

 

A: JohannaMaria. 

 

Q: Johanna Maria, that™s beautiful. 

 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: And what did you father do? 

 

A: He had an interior decora
ting business, he was wallpaper
ing, and floor covering, and he 
had a ma n who did all the upholstery, and he di
d everything in interior decorating, and he 
had people working for him, and he loved it, be
cause I reme mber in -- when he was in his 
80™s -- you know, loads of people say that you di
e -- if I would come  back, I would be 
some thing different. And I said -- Father was 
in his 80™s, I said, ﬁD
ad, if you would come  
back? ﬂ  He said, ﬁI would go exactly the same .ﬂ 
 

Q: Really? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481

A: He loved his work. And he was recommende
d by a very well known architect, and that 
architect worked for the lower nobility, 
you know, we still ha d dukes, and earls, and 
whatever. And he always recommended my dad,
 so he had [indecipherable] royal library, 
my father always had. In the summer  they cl
osed it, they had to check the curtains and 
everything, so -- he had a good business. 
 

Q: So he o -- he owned the business? 

 

A: Y -- he started it as a young guy, and just -- 

 

Q: Right. 

 

A: -- because he loved his wo
rk, so he gave quality -- 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: -- work, and they recommended. 

 

Q: And did your mother work as well? 

 

A: Mom took the phone calls, but Mom -- she had 
four kids, and at the time you ha -- didn™t 
have laundry machines, or you didn™t have all th
e stuff we have, so it was a full time  job. 
 

Q: Were you comfortable fina
ncially during this time? 
 

A: We had -- we were not wealthy, but we were
 comfortable, we never had -- except for the 
war, hunger, or whatever. N
o, it was -- we had a good life. 
 

Q: Did you want -- 

 

A: They sent us -- we had music lessons, and you know, that -- 

 

Q: You played piano, didn™t you? 

 

A: Yeah, I -- I was not very ta
lented, but Mom insisted all four of us had to take -- my 
brother is really good, he can play any instru
me nt he sees. He  could be a professional 

cellist. 
 

Q: Really? 

 

A: He plays beautiful, oh. And that was hi
s life, but you know, then he wanted to go 
professional, but people said to him -- now, he
 studied for fun six hours a day, forget it. I 
mean, I thought an hour study every day at pi
ano was already long enough, after all the 
schoolwork. But he just loved it. And -- but they
 said, ﬁNow it is your love, and then it 
become s your work.ﬂ So then he went for awh
ile in Father™s busine
ss, but he didn™t like 
it. And he is now -- he studied psychology, and 
then he ma rried a girl that got a job in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
5 
 
 
Sweden, in a -- in -- she was dietician, a
nd Anthroposophy, that is the study of Rudol ph 
Steiner, they believe in reincarnation, and that 
is what they are. And then he went to work 
there, and it™s all what he knew. He ma
de -- now he -- he got higher up, and higher up, 
and then a fa ther of a kid -- they -- they ha
d lots of kids from other countries, in 
Scandinavia Anthroposophy is very big, and th
ere was a Danish girl there, and at one 
point there was trouble in Sweden, he was 
in Sweden, and they -- th -- they were 
[indecipherable] to him, and he said, you know
, you start something like this in Denmark, 
and he did. And he started with
 six kids, and now it™s one of
 the biggest things, and the 
governme nt asks, take our kids, take our kids
, and it has grown. But he has only the very 

severest me ntally handicapped children, who 
mi ss a part of their brain. And they have 
taught them everything. I mean, it™s as in the 
Bible, everybody has a gift, and those kids 

just as well. And one is musical, and anot
her one can paint, and another one have[ 
indecipherable] things, silversmithing, they do 
everything. And they have an artist staff, 
and my brother directs, and I 
couldn™t believe it. There™s -- the -- the televi sion theme, 
and the radio themes [indecipherable] were pl
aying for us. They do not Mary had a little 
lamb, but they do the children™s symphony of Ha ydn, and none of those kids can read a 

note of musi c, I said, ﬁHow do you do it? ﬂ  
He says, ﬁCome along.ﬂ And then he has a 
teacher who plays flute, and the 
kids who want to play flute,
 look, and they play and they 
ma ke a fe w mi stakes when the teacher is pl aying, and the second time they do much 

better, and the fourth time  they playing without any mi stake, and so all the instrume nts, 

and then they do it together. N
o, it™s terrific, what he does. 
 

Q: Te -- tell me  about your parents, what were
 they like as people, and being your mother 
and father? 
 

A: My father had a terrific sense of humor. 
And he was such an honest businessman. I only 
had very good examples, because you know, 
when the war br oke out, the Germans took 

everything to Germany, but my father had a bi
g supply of drapes, and whatever, he had a 
big supply. And then all the others, you know, th
ey raised their pric
es, they could just 
double it, or what. My father said, ﬁI™ve work
ed 30 years for those people,ﬂ and he just 

put his norma l thing. So I saw that he was 
not outfor money, he 
was for honesty, and he 
loved his customers. And Mom,
 Mom was his sweetheart, and 
the -- I mean, it was a real 
-- they were 64 years ma rried wh
en they finally died, and -- 
 

Q: 64years? 

 

A: Yeah, 64 years. And I can only say she wa
s always, you know, benda -- baker came  at the 
door, and the milkma n c a me  at the door, and 
the ma n for the benzena -- you had those 
little things, or whatever, it™s not gasoline, 
kerosene, came at the door, and then in the 
war, there were no cars, I mean it was with 
a horse  and a -- and a cart, and when it was 
ice cold, Mom always said, do you want a c
up of hot coffee, or hot chocolate, or 
some thing. So I had good examples. 
 

Q: So did you spend a lot of time with your parents, were they with you a lot?

A: Father was very busy, because in the 
spring especially, everybody wanted Eman, 
some ti me s that he left the house at six, and 
came home  at 10. So we always had our hot 
meal in the evening, if Fa ther would be hom
e. But he tried every time  -- it™s his own 
business, it™s difficult to break out, but I reme mb ered it for a long time when we were 
early teeners, that he tried al
ways to be home Friday or Saturday night, and then we did 

game s and things, and we could invite our friends. 
 

Q: Uh-huh. 

 

A: And the other -- our house was always th
e center of young people, and we had an organ, 
and the piano, and the cello, so ther
e was a lot of classi cal mu sic. 
 

Q: You had an organ and a piano? 

 

A: Piano, and -- 

 

Q: An upright piano, or a -- 

 

A: An upright piano, it was 
a very [indecipherable] Steinb
ach. And the organ, that were 
those Dutch, little -- th
at you still had to -- 
 

Q: That worked with the foot, yes. 

 

A: So -- but we had that, and we
 all had to learn mus i c, oh. 

 

Q: So you -- you would say your childhood was a very joyous one? 
 
A: Yeah. 

 

Q: And you we re close with your -- 

 

A: Parents. Now, when you are earl
y teen, you know, you get rebellious -- 

 

Q: Yes. 

 

A: -- and you -- you -- and I reme mber that if
 we had a mood, you know, if you came down, 
and you are in a bad mo od, and Mom would just
 kindly say, ﬁOh, we don™t loo -- want to 
look at that face. Go back to your room, and come  back when you can ha ve a 

[indecipherable] face.ﬂ And then you got
 back and you say, ﬁ What am I doing 
[indecipherable] thing?  It 
was very -- you know, but when you a teenager, you some times 
become  difficult. 
 

Q: Yes. And school, did you like school? 

 

A: Yeah. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
7 
 
 
Q: Youdid? 
 

A: I was a straight A student , it came all easy, yeah. 

 

Q: Really?  It came  easy to you? 

 

A: And mostly this in languages or what we 
call [indecipherable], what is it?  Sciences. But I 
could -- I -- I think that God 
gave me a good speller. Brains
 [i ndecipherable] brains, it 
was all very easy.  
 

Q: Did you have favorite subject
s?  Wa s language it -- were -- 
 

A: The languages were my favorite, yeah. 

 

Q: Was your favorite. 

 

A: And we had -- it was like I told you, ev
ery day an hour in each language, Fr ench, 
German, English and Dutch, and for the finals
 you had to -- to read 10 books in each 
original language, so 10 in French, and -- 
and you had to me morize three poems, and not 
Mary had a little lamb, but of Longfe
llow, or something, in each language. 
[indecipherable] from the Germans. And our 
exams were not [indecipherable] the school, 
they had -- you had the parochial schools, 
the Christian schools, a
nd the public schools. 
And I lived in The Hague, and when it was exam time, it was June, then -- or July, then, 

this section of The Hague, 
whatever school you were, had to
 come  to a big gimnasium, 
and there were all tabl es, and the paperswere face down, and governme nt guys from the 

Departme nt of Education, they were walk
ing -- you were not to talk, you were not 
allowed to go to the bathroom. The bell ra
ng, and then you could turn your paper, and 
then you had so much time for that subject. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: And you enter the ne xt subject. And you have 
two days in writing, and then one day or al, 
and the oral was three weeks later, mostly, af
ter the [indecipherable]. And it was also for 
governme nt guys, [indecipherable] and then you cam
e in the gym, and there were all little 
round tables, three guys sitting, French, E
nglish, German, ma th, geometry, geography, 
and history, and then each half an hour. And 
you came to the French table, and then they 
said, ﬁWhich books have you read?ﬂ So you have 
to sh -- in French, and then you have to 

show it. And they said in French, tell thatand that episode out of
 that and that book. And 
you had to do it in French, which is very ha
rd, you know?  And so we™re -- and then this 
poem, and t hen you have to recite the poem. So [indecipherable] 
 

Q: I realize I forgot to as
k you two questions. One, what
™s the date of your birth? 
 

A: April30
th
, 1920. 
 

Q: 1920. And you were born in The Hague? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
8 
 
 
 
A: In The Hague. And that was also the birthd
ay of our crown princess, Juliana. So -- and 
then all the fl ags were out,
 and the schools were closed, and every morning there were 
parades, and my Mom always told me, 
ﬁThat™s for you.ﬂ You know, it was the big 
disappointment when I found out it was for Ju
liana. But I was still happy that I was born 
on her birthday, so -- 
 

Q: That™s funny. Tell me  fr om -- I read your au
tobiography, and the place of religion in your 
life is really extremely signi
ficant, or ma ybe it™s just G
od, I don -- I don™t quite know 
how to -- 
 

A: No. 

 

Q: So if you can tell me  about your - the way 
in which you were raised in terms of religion. 
 

A: Now, we we nt to church
, and our denomi nati
on, Christian Refor med has two services, 
but my parents said one time we want you 
to go, the second time, you ma y. So there was 

no to force like some  parents do. And they
 always, you know, you went to catechism, and 
you learned the Bible, and it 
was really a life thing, you know, and you had to -- and I 
still think, I mean words are cheap, but then 
you have to do, and that™s why I went -- we 
all went in Rothenberg, and I™m really proud be
cause after the war, years later, I had to 
go -- in the Netherlands after the war, the 
queen ma de a new departme nt, like you have 
here, agriculture, and to -- now whatever, 
all the departme nts. And our queen said we 

have a departme nt of war  documentation. A
nd usually th-they still were looking for 
witnesses, and by chance they found me  in Ameri
ca, and I could help a 
little bit, so I was 
asked to come  to the Netherlands, and I 
spoke to the big shot from this war 
documentation, and he told me  that our denomination, Christian Reforme d, and it™s really 

small, were the highest in resistance, and al
so had given mos t  of 
their lives. And I think 
we are very principled. And sometimes it goe
s to the -- too stiff, you know, that -- but 
that you have to want. But it 
was really [indecipherable] 
 

Q: Is -- is Christian Reformed a part of
 a -- the Protestant religion, or is it -- 
 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: Itis? 

 

A: The Refor med -- the state church in the Ne
therlands is Reformed, and then automatically, 
like in England, the queen and the king are th
e head of the church. And at one point, I 
think in the 1800™s, there were people who sa
id yeah, but if you are born a king or a 
queen, doesn™t ma ke you a Christian. So they sa
id, well, that™s not right. And then there 
were other things, a few more, I don™t know exactly what, so they separated from -- but 

it™s very close, it™s only that -- you know, th
e [indecipherable] and we have been very 

lucky, because our fe -- our royal family are 
Christians and they are always me mbers of 
the Reforme d church. But it™s very close to
 the Re for med church, but it™s smaller.  
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
9 
 
 
Q: But Christian Refor m is not the 
Reformed church, it™s a different -- 
 
A: It is a branch -- 

 

Q: A branch -- 

 

A: -- that broke off from the Refor med church. 

 

Q: And how would you characterize Christian 
Reform, and ho-how does one differentiate 
that from -- 
 

A: Now, they are very biblical. See, becaus
e I know here in Ameri
ca the Baptists honor the 
New Testament, because they say that™s the 
time  that Jesus was born. But the Christian 
Reformed see it, it was a fulfillment of the Old Testament, or the Torah, as the Jewish 

people say. So we had really to study the w
hole Bible, and at our meals, I mean every 
day, and Father always started each meal w
ith prayer, because if you read the Bible, 
when Jesus ate, it always said, ﬁAnd Jesu
s, looking up, thanked God for the meal,ﬂ and 
then he st arted eating. So, I mean, it™s practically putting up, and I reme mber that our 

breakfast could be that we had to go out in 
-- in -- you know, my brother, ma ybe to leave 
earlier for school, and Father some time s left
 at six, but the [indecipherable] meal was 
always that we sat at the ta
ble. And then my brother, w
ho is the cellist, is studying, and 
we -- we had a l-large house, and he was on 
the third floor, in the music room. And then 
we all sat at table and Father 
wanted to say a prayer, and Albe
rt wasn™t there. So they go 
out, ﬁAlbert, you have to come , Father is si
tting.ﬂ You know, I felt 
like [indecipherable]. 
And then he did the few, and he forgot it, a
nd we had to call him again, so -- but then, we 
had had our hot meal, and then Father always
 pulled the Bible out and read a small part 
of the Bible. He skipped what I call the 
dull part, you know, this one begat that, begat 
that, begat that -- 
 

Q: Right,right. 

 

A: But -- so we knew the Bible, and every [ind
ecipherable] it was a sacrifice that they sent  
us to the Christian school, they said, ﬁI
f we don™t support it, they don™t.ﬂ So every 
Monday mo rning, had to learn the psalm 
that you had Sunday. The parents were 

[indecipherable] if the kids [indecipherable
] for Monday mo rning, you had to say your -- 
what you had to me mori ze. And looking back, you know, then you hated it, but in the 

camp, and in the prison -- 
 

Q: Ithelped. 

 

A: You -- it -- I knew so ma ny things by heart, 
and it came, and it was such a strength, and a 
hope for me . I™m really grateful for that. 
 

Q: But when you were growing up, you were not always so -- 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
10 
 
 
A: No, some times you thought, oh, you know -- but
 -- and -- and you had pastors who could 
keep your attention, and some  your -- I reme mb
er that I -- we had a church that had a 
roof, an all wooden, beautiful wood, and then th
ey [indecipherable] just to decorate it, 
and I was counting. 
 
Q: You were counting. 

 

A: Yeah, that wa s -- if it wa
s not an interesting sermon, but
 I think orchids do that. 
 

Q: You me ntioned that you had a big house. 
How -- how big, because the -- the houses that I 
saw, at least in Amsterdam -- 
 

A: No, no, th-they -- it was when we lived in The Hague, my M o m -- my M o m™ s father was 
a pilot in -- a pilot at sea, you know, to bring 
the ships in. And he was always at sea, and 
a lot of our family were seafarers. So I th
ink Mom brought a bit, and she always wanted 

to meet, but that™s not good for a business. So then I think we moved west from a house 

to a bigger house, and that was very interes
ting, it was all -- it had steps, and then a 
platform, and then there were two doors, a
nd the right one was ours. But on the other 
side, where the street was, it 
had steps down, and there was so
uterrain, and -- it™s called. 
And then you had -- came in the -- the lower floo
r, and there was Father™s work store, and 
there was a big family kitchen like the farm
ers have, and the -- behind it was a -- a yard. 
And we had -- they ma de a little pond in it, 
and we had little goldfishes. And then the 
first floor had in front, the room wher e the or
gan and the piano were, 
and in the back, the 
living room. The second floor was Father™s a
nd Mother™s bedroom, and the room wher e 
my Father received his customers, and thenthe floor up there, there were the girl™s 

bedroom, and the boy™s bedroom, and there was 
an attic. So it was more height, you 
know?  
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: And then, at the end of the yard, there was a 
ya -- what do you call it? It was not a river, it 
was much smaller, but it was a little str
eam, and behind that there was a big -- how you 

call it here, now?  [indecipherable]
, a big -- I think this is called a kaserne. All -- the 
cavalry, the horses were there, and that was a -- 
 

Q: Abarracks? 

 

A: Ar mory,armory. 

 

Q: Oh,ah. 

 

A: And that was where we loved it, becauseit was, you know, open, and space, and trees. 
But in the morning, he [indecipherable] fr
om the [indecipherable] and then -- and 
some ti me s you heard the hor
ses, I loved it, oh. 
 

Q: Did you have pets? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
11 
 
 
 
A: Yeah. 

 

Q: Youdid? 

 

A: We had two -- we had two cats, and a dog. A
nd later I got two turtles, one was called Ole 
Tuft, that™s a Norwegian name , and the ot
her one, was [indecipherable] the time of 
Ethiopia was Haile Salas.  
 

Q: And so you called it Haile Salas?  Yes? 

 

A: And I think I was nine, and I was alwa ys 
brushing the dog, and also push -- polishing his 
teeth, and anyway -- and I felt so neglectful that
 I never did anything fo
r those turtles, and 
when I called them, they stuck their neck out
, and they had -- so I took furniture polish, 

and I polished them, and they were so beauti
ful shiny, and three days later they were 
dead, and my father said that I had clogge
d up all their pores. But I think they were 

beautiful in their deaths.  
 

Q: Better in death, that™s -- were most of your
 friends of the same religious denomination 
that you -- 
 

A: We lived in that street, and we were all 
teeners, and we had such a fun [indecipherable]. 
A little bit further lived a fa mily with three 
boys, and we were all -- so you had -- yeah, in 

Germany, the stuff was getting -- is Hitler, so
 one of the boys then turned out to be a 
Nazi, and the oldest was a Communi st, and the in-between was in-between. And so they 

were different, and of course, was another c
ouple, a young girl, and her brother, her older 
brother, Paul and Jopie and they -- they
 were nothing, and now they were just -- 
 

Q: In -- in The Hague, were there -- were
 there many Jews living in The Hague? 

 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: There were. Jewish population. 

 

A: We had a large Jewish quarter, with s
ynagogues, and very beautif
ul old synagogue there 
was, there we re a lot of Jewish people. Bu
t you know, that is the b
eautiful thing of the 
Netherlands. In [indecipherable] they were 
persecuted in Portugal and Spain, and they 
were killed and burned by th
e Inquisition. And in England 
you can read the books, that 
they look down upon the Jews. Germany definitel
y, Austria definitely, France also a little 
bit. And [indecipherable]. So they came, and in
 those years, loads of them came  to the 
Netherlands, and they said -- you know. And so
 we had loads of Ger man J e ws, and -- no, 
of Dutch Jews who had been there for centuries. 
 

Q: Mm-hm. So they were -- they 
were very integrated in the -- 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
12 
 
 
A: Very integr ated -- because  I was working at a bank later, when I had my first job ne xt to 
Herman and [indecipherable] -- he was Jewish, 
but later he told me  he didn™t even know 
it, his parents didn™t do anything on their reli
gion. But we had so ma ny Je wish people, 
and y -- that didn™t ma ke any difference.  
 
Q: And did you grow up, and have friend
s who were -- who were Jewish kids? 
 

A: Who were not Christians, yeah. 

 

Q: And there was not -- there was not a problem between -- 

 

A: You didn™t even think about it. 

 

Q: Right,uh-huh. 

 

A: They were your friends, or 
they were not your friends -- 

 

Q: Right, that™s -- 

 

A: -- you liked them, or you did not like th
em, but it was the only [indecipherable], you 
know, it was no difference, that was -- 
 

Q: So, when you were 13 years old, and Hitler 
come s to power in Germany, are you -- are 
you very conscious politically 
at that age, or is -- 
 

A: No, at 13, not really. 
 
Q: No. So -- 

 

A: And then Hitler was in the beginning, you know
, he started in Bavaria, and so on, and we 
heard about it, and we really thought well, a 
big screamer. We  already knew he had a big 
mouth, and he was always screaming. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: But then h-he grew in power, and then when Hindenburg gave over, I mean then he wa s 
the boss, and then we realized. But I -- then we 
st arted to realize, but 
still not to the extent 
that it really -- 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: -- we really were made aware by the danger --  we heard that the Hitler youth was, and I 
was [indecipherable] vacation, I think was 15 or 
16, at the eastern part
 of the Netherlands, 
we were some where at the farm, and that we 
learned -- we had lots of friend -- with my 

two girlfriends, and we were biking, and the 
border was not controlled, it was close to the 
border, and we me t a couple of German kids, 
germ -- and they were in the Hitler youth, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
13 
 
 
and they were fanatic, and fanatic. And 
I was surprised, I thought aw, you know. But my 
girlfriends were open for it, th
ey listened, and they were very impressed. And then later, 
in ™38, so it was ma ybe two years later, you kno
w it, that Kristallnach
t, that those -- and 
in the he -- at  that  time, I reme mber in the papers, they pret ended that it was a 
spontaneous uprising of the young people agai
nst those Jews who are doing all this 
criminal whatever. 
 

Q: Right,right. 

 

A: But it wasn™t, it was very organized, but [ind
ecipherable] later -- that turned out later that 
they found that. So, and then yeah, they ki
lled so ma ny Jews, a
nd they took prisoners, 
and they burned the synagogues, and that is wh
en really we were aware of the danger of 
the Nazi [indecipherable] 
 

Q: So it was 1938 when you became -- 

 

A: ™38. November nine 
was the Kristall -- 

 

Q: Right, right, but a year 
before that, some body come s and 
lives with your parents --  
 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: -- a person who become s 
very significant to you. 
Can you tell us about it? 
 

A: That was funny, because my parents always tried to help everybody, and what do you call 
it in the church, the guy that takes care that th
e ha -- is clean, and wh
atever, the 
janitor -- 
 

Q: Janitor? 

 

A: -- or whatever. He didn™t clean hims e l f, but
 that wa s a couple without kids, and they once 
in awhile came  to visit us. They had no ch
ildren, and my parents 
invited them now and 
then. So one day they ask if he wanted to co
me , and he talks to my parents, and he said, 
ﬁI have a friend, a Friesian,ﬂ they were of
ten [indecipherable] and they™re very proud, and 
he says, ﬁAnd he lost his wife, and he has 
10 kids, and now the olde
st has gotten a job in 
The Hague,ﬂ with -- they start 
with paying so little. See, now
 the kids go either in the 
dorms, or in an apartment or something. But th
ere was no way at that time. So he asked if 
that guy could come  in our house, and my moth
er said, ﬁI can™t have a boarder.ﬂ She had 
[indecipherable], the phone was 
always ringing, and people came  that they wanted to talk 
to my dad, a nd she was very busy, and you had no laundry machines, no nothing. So she 

said, ﬁNo, I can™t.ﬂ And then he said oh, but
 -- well, you know. So in the end, my father 
says, ﬁI need to talk to Wi l mer, that™s her 
decision. She has a,ﬂ -- a
nd then in the end my 
mom said, ﬁI can™t have a board
er, but I can have another child.ﬂ So he ca -- and I was so 
furious because The Hague is very old city,and you know, the -- the 
houses at that time  
didn™t have a shower and a bathroom. I m
ean, you had a toilet, but that -- you had 
everywhere those -- what do you call it, thos
e basins when -- where you washed yourself, 

and Saturday night you could either go to a 
public bathhouse, that you had to pay, or you 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
14 
 
 
could wash yourself from top to toe, but th
at was -- at that time , it was 1938 and so. And 
then, with my brothers, my -- at that time, in
 ™38, my oldest brothe
r had already left for 
Indonesia, he -- he was in the Air For
ce. Anyway, you ran in your house in your 
underwear, and in your slip, and 
whatever, and that were your
 brothers, but if you have a 
strange guy, you have to put your gown on, and it™
s totally different. So I just hated it, to 
have -- and he had a nice -- I didn™t want an
 intruder in the house. And then I was so 
angry, I think, that I di
dn™t speak to my mo m for  days. A
nd then she said I am so angry 
about it [indecipherable], I hate it. And I 
thought, well, I™m going to dislike this guy, I 
mean, he™s an intruder in our house, and I thought -- his name  was Hein, now that is a 
far mer™s name , I hated it. And I thought in -- 
in the Netherlands -- in here it is beautiful, 

but in the Netherlands it wa
s horrible if you had red hair.Then they calle
d you carrot top, 
or all the lighthouses had re
d -- or a lighthouse. So the kids really unmercifully 
[indecipherable], and mo stly they had freckle
s, of course. And th
en you™ll see he has a 
red hair, and freckles, and boo -- and I was 
so -- I thought, well, I don™t like him. And 

then, he would -- 
 

Q: Wait a mi nute, I™m -- I™m afraid we™re going to
 have to continue this after we stop the 
tape. 
 

A: Okay. That he broke your heart? 

 

Q: Yes. 

 
End of Tape #1 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
15 
 
 
Tape #2 
 
Q: So we were talking about Hein comi ng to your house. 

 

A: Ohyeah. 

 

Q: What -- what -- his name  is Hein, and his last name? 

 

A: H-e-i-n, Hein. And -- 

 

Q: It™sHein. 

 

A: -- in -- in Dutch we say Hein. And I think 
like in German, you ha
ve Heinrich, you know? 
 

Q: Right,right. 

 

A: That™s a German na me , s o this is -- and it™
s a name  in Friesland, 
that™s in the northern 
part, and he was from there. 
 

Q: And his last name ?  

 

A: Sietsma, S-i-e-t-s-m- a, Sietsma.  

 

Q: Sietsma. 

 

A: All the Friesian names end of ma or sta.
 That™s so funny -- in 
that province there. 
 

Q: Really?  Huh. So, did you adjust after a few da
ys to his being there,
 or did it take you a 
while to? 
 

A: I reme mber that I said I™d -- he would co
me  on a Saturday afternoon, I said, ﬁI won™t be 
home .ﬂ And Mom said, ﬁI have to do a fe
w -- a little bit of shopping, but I™ll see he 
would come  late in the afternoon.ﬂ And I™m 
home alone, and the door
bell rings, and there 
stands this handsome guy. But then it was He
in, I had to open him, and I was alone home , 
and I hated him. And I™d made up my he -- my  
mi nd that I would hate him. So, eve n if he 
looked very nice, I hated him, because that is
 what I had decide d. And I wasn™t ni ce to 
him at all, and he fell in love with me , a
nd he told my mo m. And then later he ma de 
friends at the office, and he went to a 
study group from my church, young men, so then 
three of them rented an apartment, so he
 was -- I don™t know, ma ybe half a year in our 
house. But my parents got to love  hi m like a son, and I tolerated him, because I™d ma de 

up my mi nd. You know 
how stubborn you can be. 
 

Q: Yeah. 

 

A: And then when the war -- when he -- they were all mobilized, you know, when the threat 
in ™39 came, and the end of ™38, so -- and he ha
d to be at the river, the IJssel, that goes 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
16 
 
 
parallel with the German border. And ther
e were bunkers near the water, so -- oh, and 
[indecipherable] and they were often there.
 And because he ha d been so long in our 
house, our family wrote him that was the only 
thing they had. See, now they have those 
nice military homes where they can go for reading a paper, and play piano, and do card 
games, there was nothing. They slept in 
[indecipherable] and everybody was mobilized, 

people with businesses, and there was nothing. So
 I reme mbe r  that in the pulpit, and in 
the papers, it said open your house for the m
ilitary, and invite them. 
So with that -- that 
armory right behind our house, Momma wrote 
a note, Christian fa mily with organ and 
piano, some body wants to come  is welcome, fo
r in the evening, read
ing the papers, or -- 
and then the two Friesians came, and they late
r told that they quick had taken the paper 

off. So they became like brothers, and Hein wa
s there alone on that -- so we wrote him all 
the time. And then I had also to write my little
 note. Father  wrote, Mother wrote, Albert  
wrote, my sister wrot e. So I -- and then 
you have here only one word, dear. I-If you write 
a business letter you start dear, but also if
 you love some body, but we have different 
words. So the first letters th
at I wrote was Beste, that is
 distance, you know, Beste. And 
then I reme mber when it really got dangerous
, I all of a sudden 
thought, ﬁOh my God, if 
he gets hurt or killed,ﬂ and then I realized
 I loved him, but it -- it was really -- and I 

thought -- but in the Netherlands, you know, I 
think the girls right 
now, they go after the 
boys, but you didn™t do that back then. And I l
oved this -- stupid, idiot, I was -- and all 
my girlfriends were in love with him, and I 
thought oh, this is terrib
le, I -- and I told my 
mom, she said, ﬁWell, he was in love with 
you, he told me .ﬂ But then she had told him, 

she™s not ye t ready for it, because -- this is craz
y, I -- I really don™t dare to tell this, but I 
must have been 17, and he came in our house,
 and I had those two girlfriends, and my 
brother and his friends, and I 
was a tomboy. And then Saturday afternoons when we had 
off from school, we often had school Saturd
ay mornings still, we went on our bikes 
outside The Hague, and we have so ma ny canal
s, and ditches, and trees everywhere, and 
we had the greatest fun that we took a run, and 
then tried to jump a 
ditch. And every time  
a rider went in the [indecipherable] al
ways one of us would fall in. You -- 
 
Q: You mean, with the bicycle?  
You would try to run a ditch? 
 

A: No,no 

 

Q: Oh, you would run -- 

 

A: We put the bicycles on the m
eadow, and then we took a run -- 
 

Q: And then you -- I see. 

 

A: -- and jump. And we climbed trees, and we 
had so much fun, we play -- I don™t know, I 
think I was very late that  I was mature. But anyway, then Hein ask me all the time, Hein 

[indecipherable] let™s go for a bike ride, let™
s go for -- to the dunes, or something. And, 
no I -- I didn™t like him, you know, that was 
my -- so one Saturday
 afternoon, my friends 
all had to go to their grandm
other in the city, that they
 could go on a bike, but it was 
ma ybe two hours. So they weren™t there, a
nd Hein asked again, and oh well -- well, I™ve 
nothing better to do. So I went, and I told th
e girls, he asked me  again to bike -- go 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
17 
 
 
[indecipherable]. So then they asked me  
when I came back, how was it. I said, ﬁSo 
boring, we never climbed a tree.ﬂ But he wa
s I think 18, close to 19 and was much mo re 
ma ture. So that was the only thing, and then wh
en I realized this, then he -- he wrote us 
back, and then one day I got a letter, and it wa
s directed to me , and then he wrote, ﬁMy 
next leave, I want come  to The Hague.ﬂ A
nd he had been before, but it was always for 
the family, you know. He said, ﬁAnd this time
 it™s not for the fa mily, it™s just for you.ﬂ 
And I was happy as possible. So then he came, and then it clicked. 
 
Q: Right. 

 

A: With [indecipherable]. He was a wonderful 
person, always living for others, and thinking 
that he was so selfish.  
 

Q: Were you working in -- in th
e bank in 1937?  [indecipherable] 
 

A: It was a big, beautiful old 
bank in the center of the city, a
nd I was -- I had th
ere, with the 
informational section. 
 

Q: And was that the same  time that you me t Hein? 
 
A: That I met -- 

 

Q: Or was that afterwards? 

 

A: No, I was -- I stayed there shur -- they paid
 very little. And then 
I got an offer to work 
some where else, and they paid better, so -- 
and I took those Spanish lessons, because see, 
that degree was four years, and I can -- la
nguages come  fast, and you just sit in your 
class, and you have a couple [indecipherable]
 you back. So I found a profess -- professor 
who said, ﬁI™ll prepare you for that exam,ﬂ -- 
I asked him. I said, ﬁThen load me  up with 
home work, and I come  once a week, an hour that you can check, and whatever.ﬂ And I 
had to pay him, I think three quarter of my 
salary, but I did it with
 -- just within two 
years. So -- and that was worth it. And then 
I still took another exam, but I needed -- with 
money for my -- because I had hardly any le
ft for myself with pocket money, so when 
they offered this -- it was -- with the ot
her one, wa s a governme nt job, and it was for the 
father of a youth friend of mi ne
, who lived three years across from me . So she said, ﬁMy 
father needs a secretary,ﬂ so then I went, and 
they paid better. But the war days, I was in 
the bank.  
 

Q: Duringthewar? 

 

A: Right, days of the war.  

 

Q: During the first five days of the war? 

 

A: We had -- well, see we fought. Denmark di
dn™t get one bullet. And Sweden let them go 
through and attack Norway. Norway fought
. And Belgium didn™t have an army. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
18 
 
 
 
Q: Right. 

 

A: And I -- we later learned th
at Hitler had like all travel 
agents [indecipherable] you know, 
[indecipherable], from us go 10 days to Eur
ope, Wednesday morning for the Netherlands, 
Wednesday afternoon for France, Tuesday fo
r Switzerland, and so. 
And Hitler made a 
schedule for the war, and he had given Monday 
for the Netherlands, but he forgot that we 
are very stubborn, and 
we fought fi ve days. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: In the afternoon of the fife -- fir -- fift h 
day, they bombarded the open city of Rotterdam 
in the center, where there was nothing military. Hospitals, museums, churches, 

cathedrals. And thousands died 
, and it was -- and then their 
general said to our general, 
ﬁIf you don™t surrender [i ndecipherable] to 
The Hague, I™m [indecipherable].ﬂ And he 

surrendered after five days.  
 

Q: So -- right. 

 

A: But those five days of the war, I was in that bank. 

 

Q: In the bank. So you™ve known Hein now for th
ree years, when the war come s in 1940 to 
the Netherlands [indecipherable] 
 

A: Two and a half years, it came at
 the end of the [indecipherable] 
 
Q: So -- right. So you essentiall
y, within six or eight months, you 
realize you™re in love with 
this guy. And this is the first time  
you™ve had a boyfriend, am I right? 
 
A: Now, you had -- you know, when we went 
-- playing robbery so-called, you had friends, 
but that was nothing, you know, you 
didn™t kiss or anything, but -- 
 

Q: This was serious. 

 

A: -- but that wa s just specia
l friend. I reme mber that there 
was a guy that I was at that 
Christian high school that was quite far awa
y, and it was 45 mi nutes on the bike to go 

home , and then all of us [indecipherable] a
nd I saw Tim from our st
reet, and biking next 
to me . ﬁOh, how nice to see you here. I had to 
go here,ﬂ and so -- like it was casual, but 

he came then, ma ybe they are 15 or 16, th
at was -- you know, the -- Ti m was my friend, 
but nothing else. But if he -- you know, we ha
d -- we did funny -- fun games, and if there 
was a fair, like a country fair, or so, y
ou went with the whole group, and then -- 
 

Q: Right. But this was quite different? 

 

A: Yeah, that wa s different. This
 was [indecipherable] just -- 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
19 
 
 
Q: Were the girlfriend jealous because it wa
s clear that he was in love with you? 
 
A: Yeah. 

 

Q: Ibet. 

 

A: Uh-huh, yeah. But then they found their own 
boyfriends, so -- but I know that a lot had a 
crush on him.  
 

Q: So he was whe -- he was in your house for 
about six months, and then he was in an 
apartment in The Hague? 
 

A: An apartment with his two friends.  

 

Q: And did you end up seeing each other a great deal at that point? 
 
A: It was so funny, because one was from anot
her city, Zwollen, and if
 his girlfriend came  
over, and he was engaged, but it was no proper 
-- so they always -- the girlfriend from -- 

they [indecipherable] slept in
 our house, my mom was alwa
ys -- it was really like the 
holiday, and we never knew. And the other on
e had a girlfriend who lived in The Hague. 
And we three girls are dear, dear friends. We  h
it it off so right. So we were mostly with 
the whole group, and I™m still now -- the two othe
r guys died, later, from old age. But for 
all those years I was their friend. 
 

Q: You™restillfr iends? 

 
A: Yeah. 
 

Q: Yeah. 

 

A: With all of them. 

 

Q: Mm-h m.  

 

A: And they all loved Hein. And I reme mber when I just came  out of the concentration 
camp, the first couple was going to get ma rried. So
 I stepped in in the church, and I -- but 
then I di sappeared again, because they we
re still looking for me . Yeah, it was -- you 
know, I had wonderful friends from that time
, be cause it™s a friendship that goes real 
deep. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: I can honestly say I loved my s -- underground 
friends more than my own sister, who was 
not really -- 
 

Q: More than Fa nny? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
20 
 
 
 
A: Yeah. 

 

Q: Uh-huh. 

 

A: She was not [indecipherable], not that it ma tte
rs, but she was a total different -- she even 
scolded, and her husband, too, you stupid, why do you 
do that, it™ll cost y
our life, and this 
and that. So -- 
 

Q: She said that to you? 

 

A: They both -- 

 

Q: They both said that? 

 

A: -- her and her husband, who she ma rried late
r, and they said, ﬁYou are stupid,ﬂ and 
whatever. But she lived in another part of th
e country, and there was 
curfew, and if any of 
our group was in that area close to 11, that you 
had to be off the street, they could always 
sleep on their couch, but they ca
lled you stupid [indecipherable] 
 

Q: Now was she very different wh
en you were growing up, as well? 
 

A: Yeah. She -- see, I was this tomboy -- 

 

Q: Right. 

 
A: -- and she wa s 15 - 16, and she liked high heel
s, and underwear with 
lots of lace, and -- 
and then she -- they said to Mom, ﬁForbid he
r to climb those trees, she is,ﬂ -- this and 
that. So -- and then, when Mother we nt a weekend to go to her mother, then she was the 
boss because she was eight years older, and I wa s ma ybe 14 or 15, and she was 22 or 23, 

and I had to obey her. And I always said, 
ﬁYou -- you are a much worse mother,ﬂ you 
know, from you I may not do [indecipherabl
e], you know, and she thought that I was 
wild, and well, in my --  
 

Q: Youwere. 

 

A: -- my tomboy -- yeah. You know, so we di -- were totally different. 

 

Q: But her fiancé was -- was 
killed in the beginning -- 
 

A: She was engaged. 

 

Q: --right? 

 

A: And -- and she would have gotten ma rried the ye
ar of the war, in September. And they all 
were drafted, and her fiancé had -- had signed a 
contract that if he 
went so ma ny years in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
21 
 
 
the -- like here they do sometimes, and then
 you get free university study, so he had 
signed up. And he was just ready to get out, 
and then the war broke out, a-and -- so he 
was -- had to stay in that service, and he 
was assigned to a small 
airport, Ypenburg, just 
outside The Hague. And then the morning of th
e war, Hitler ha d the evening before given 
a big speech, and I had heard it as ma  -- a
nd I knew Ger man. And he said -- because by 
that time, they had taken -- France was alrea
dy occupied, because they had been able to 
hold it in ™39. And then he had taken Au
stria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, that was 
beginning of the second World Wa r, they 
had ma rched through Sweden, Norway. So 
only that sliver of the Netherlands, and Be
lgium were not occupied by [indecipherable] 
Franco was Nazi, whole Europe was Nazi. So
 we were very, very nervous, and -- and 
Hitler said, ﬁI know that the Dutch are scar
ed, they don™t have  to be. They are very 
unimportant, and I don™t need that piece of land.ﬂ And then he said, ﬁAnd they were not 

in the first World Wa r, and I will respect thei
r neutrality.ﬂ That were his literal words. 

And while he was saying that, at nine PM
, his troops were already ma rching to our 
borders, and to our bridges, so he was a big, 
fat liar. And I think that that ma de me  so 
furious that I thought, ﬁHow did 
he have the guts to say th
is on the radio while he knew 
this,ﬂ -- from -- that ma de me  so ma d. And the
n, five days later, when they came in, with 
their goosestep, and their helmets, and thei
r tanks, and their proud 
faces -- I reme mber 
that they ma rched in [indecipherable] out st
anding the bank, and the tears were streaming 
down our cheeks. And that™s when I ma de my 
vow, I™ll never, never speak one word of 
German. We  have not invited them. And then 
-- and we saw what they were doing to our 

Jewish people. I got really to
 -- to hate the Nazi system. 
 

Q: Did you not expect the Germans to come  into
 the Netherlands, in spite of the fact that 
they had attacked Poland, and they 
had gone into the other European -- 
 
A: I think that our government -- I, as a girl 
of 19 didn™t think so, because we hadn™t been in 
the fi rst World War. But I later had, and it was 
nearly hilarious, that
 our governme nt was 
bringing itself in [indecipherable] to stay 
neut ral. So they had built bunkers towards 
Germany. So they built a few bunkers along 
the coast against [i
ndecipherable]. You 
know, it™s really laughable when 
you think about it, that they 
were trying to be -- to be 
neutral, but -- 
 

Q: Neutral. So it must have been a big s
hock to you after you heard Hitler™s speech, when 
you saw the troops come  in. 
 

A: Yeah, I remember that night. See, in the 
Netherlands at that time it was so funny, because 
you know, the -- the one -- like I say, it wa
s really, the housewife was mi ssing, because 
everything was ma de from scratch, now we go to
 the store. You had a store to go for your 
meat, a store for your veggies, a store for th
is, for your tha -- dairy. So it took you time, 
an household was a whole day of work. And Monday was always laundry day, and all the 

wome n in the Netherlands, and Tuesday,I think they do -- did the ironing, and 

Wednesday, in most houses, they did the living room, and on Thursday -- but Thursday 

was always the day that -- 
well, there were no vacuum cl
eaners, but everybody had rug 
beaters, and everywhere you heard bing, ba
ng, bung. They hung it over things in the yard, 
and then they beat the rugs. 
And I reme mber that I woke up 
that night, and it was pitch 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
22 
 
 
dark, and I heard a noise like 
beating, but very fast. And 
half asleep, I thought, which 
idiot is beating the rugs in the mi ddle of th
e night?  And [indecipherable] it™s much fas t  -- 
and then I heard my parents stir in their be
droom, they mus t  have heard it, too. And we 
got up, and we went outside, and over our 
head was a battle between planes, and 

shooting. So then we went back in the house,
 and turned the radio on, and we heard that 
they had invaded our country. And then the next morning, yeah, we are so faithful in all 

we do, and I reme mber, here we were at wa
r, and then Adriaan was killed -- I mean, 
Adriaan was the fiancé of my sister, because
 [indecipherable], and we didn™t know that, 
so he was one of the first ones who was s
hot, and killed, the ear
ly morning of May 10
th
. 
And I step on my bike and I went to my offi
ce. And I™m in a big street, what then was a 

big street, I was now in The Hague, and that wa
sn™t so big, but it was still a light street. 
And I was stopped by Dutch police. And I t
hought, ﬁWhat™s this?ﬂ And they said, ﬁSay 
Scheveningen.ﬂ And I said it, that was the ci
ty where --  where Milosevi c is now in the 
prison. And then I had to say Schapensch
eerder. I don™t know if you can say that. 
 

Q: I don™t think so. 

 

A: But that is the guy who shears the sheep. 
And the Germans couldn™t say those words. 
And then I could say it, and then they let me
 go, and they said, ﬁThey are everywhere as 
spies among us.ﬂ Because about a year and a 
half before the war, two years, you coul d 
get -- the families could get a German maid so
 cheap, and they lived in your house. But 
all those German maids, a lot of them were
 spies. And for a long time, every time from 
an air base, or an army base, or whatever
, uniforms had disappeared. And they -- it was 
still -- now you don™t see it any more. I mea
n, in Vietnam, and in Korea, you don™t see 
the enemy, they just measure, and I -- shoot a 
bit farther, or lower,
 they [indecipherable], 

but at that time  they still saw each other, 
and our guys didn™t shoot at the whole groups if 
they came in our country our own unifor ms, so it was, oh, I reme mber, I was so ma d, a nd 

I still -- I think I have 
that, that if I see inju
stice, my hair goes up. 
 

Q: Did you have a fi -- a -- a fairly 
large army, or a very small army? 
 

A: No,s mall. 

 

Q: Verysmall. 

 

A: Small, was small. 

 

Q: And when was Hein drafted into the 
army, in ™39, or f -- or -- or ™40? 
 

A: I think the very end of ™38, or the begi
nning of ™39, I™m not sure, but it wa s around that 
time. 
 

Q: Uh-huh. So he was in the army about a year before the -- 

 

A: Yeah. And then he was pulled back, and he 
was in place called Ede, and I reme mber that 
Ascension day, that™s the day [indecipherable]
 really was at that church, you know, it™s 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
23 
 
 
[indecipherable] any mor e , but he said come  he
re, and that was in the mi ddle, and there is 
a little -- we are so flat, we have only -- but 
there is what we call 
the grebbeberg, that™s 
another word you can™t say, but that was a little hill, and that was in the mi ddle. And I 
was so happy that he wasn™t at the border a
ny more, I thought that™s
 the first thing. And 
so that day we spent, and he got from a frie
nd a motorbike, and I was scared stiff, and he 
had a good day, and then I went back to The Hague. And then a few days later, the war 

was -- 
 

Q: War™son. 

 

A: So then I found -- and I was worried stiff b
ecause the most were killed at the grebbeberg, 
and I didn™t know what had happened to him.
 And I have it with me, then I got a 
smudged card, a post card, I think dated May 13
th
, or was in the mi ddle of the war days, 
and it came from Rotterdam. And he had m
oved [indecipherable], I didn™t know that, 
from Ede to Rotterdam, and he was in that bombardme nt. 
 

Q: Hewas? 

 

A: He was. He was in that bombardm
ent  [indecipherable]. I didn™t know it.  
 

Q: So I guess it was a good thing that you didn™t know it.  

 

A: No, oh -- 

 

Q: You were worried enough as it was. 

 
A: Oh, it was horrible.  
 

Q: Okay. I™ve just been touched, so
 we™re going to change the tape.

Tape #3 
 
Q: Diet, your brother Arjan, your
 older brother had joined th
e army and was in Indonesia? 
 

A: He was a rese rve officer in the Netherlands, 
where they all, after th
eir training they wer -- 
had jobs. And he had -- it was a time of une mp
loyment -- that was also to promote -- that 
Hitler had so much success, ther e was such an unemployme nt everywhere, and he had a 

job, but very dull, and then at 
one point he got a letter that 
reserve officers were asked, 
volunteers if they wanted to go to Indonesia.
 And he had such a bor
ing job, so he went, 
and he was in the air force. And he was shot down when the Japs came in, and he had a 

big piece of shell in his hip, and they took it 
out, and stitch it up, and they thought he 
never walks again. So they put him in the hos
pital, and they rea
lly didn™t watch him, 
because he couldn™t walk, he was heavily wounde
d. But then it healed, and he had his -- I 
don™t know, I guess his [indecipherable] or what
ever, and he practiced
 at night, because 
he wasn™t wa tched. And then at one time  he 
escaped. And later I heard he had told other 

people, ﬁI know that my  little 
sister in the Netherlands [inde
cipherabl e] in the resi st ance.ﬂ 
He knew me , and he was a lot like I was. A
nd I always thought, if he can do anything, 
he™ll do it. And it™s true, he found a lot of 
his guys again, and then around the city of 
Brondong, they did whatever they could, resist
ance. But then he was hiding in Kamp ong, 
that™s where the Indonesians live, their vi
llages, and the settlement. But some body kne w 
that, and they betrayed him, and he was arrest
ed again, and then he was tortured to death, 
we later heard. But he was really tortured to
 death by -- in a terrible, terrible prison, the 
Suka mi skin. And nobody who went in there ever came out alive. 
 

Q: So he was captured twice, he escaped the first time? 

 
A: He was shot down first. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: And then he was captured after he -- 

 

Q: So do you know about when that happened [indecipherable] 

 

A: No. 

 

Q: Youdon™t. 

 

A: I don™t know really the date
. We  don™t know the date -- 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: -- but we heard it from t he Red Cross. And 
we had an uncle there, with his whole fa mily, 
he was a professor at the museum in Br
ondong. And that was his home. And this uncle 
had a daughter who was studying in the Netherla
nds for teacher, and at that time  the 
[indecipherable] was six years,
 because you had to go by boat,
 there were no planes, you 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
25 
 
 
had to go by boat through the 
Suez Ca nal, that took six week
s. So that daughter in the 
Netherlands didn™t have a home, so e very 
vacation, Easter, Christma s, New Year, she 
was in our house, she was like another sister
. But when my brother went there, he had 
reversed it, it was his home  there, his -- and 
they -- ther e were two 
other girls, and they 
were there. They went later 
in those horrible camps, but they told us what happened. 
 
Q: And when did you find out 
about this, after the war? 
 

A: After the war. [indecipherable] 

 

Q: After the war, so you di -- you had no id
ea whether he was okay, or he wasn™t okay -- 
 

A: We didn™t know [indecipherable]  

 

Q: -- the whole time. 

 

A: The only thing that you could once in awhile
 do was via the Red Cross, send a letter to 
non-occupied, or allied countries
, but it was heavily censored. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: We™d never got to Indonesia, no it wa s no way. 

 

Q: So that was very tough on 
your fa mily, I would imagine. 
 

A: Yeah, first my older sister, then my 
brother,then me . [indecipherable] mother. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: Having the [indecipherable] couldn™t help. 

 

Q: Right. What  did you think when the queen and the governme nt left the country, and we nt 
to England, at first? 
 

A: We were so disappointed, and so sad, and so
 furious. I have He in™s diary, he was furious. 
And we all felt -- you say the father of th
e fatherland we call the kings. She was the 
mother of -- and we said, which mother le
aves her children alone when they™re in 
trouble?  That™s when you have to be there. 
And we loved th-the Be
lgian king, he stayed, 
and he stayed with his people. And you know
 what?  The queen left with the whole 
governme nt, and they left us, and they fle
d, and they were [indecipherable] no, because 
those mi nisters left their wives, and childre
n in the Netherlands. It was really our 
governme nt that went to Engla
nd. So that was our official governme nt. And then the very 
serious Christians, you have obey what God says 
in the Bible. And in the time  of Jesus , 
they were occupied by the Roma ns.  
 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
26 
 
 
 
Q: And it™s -- so a lot of denomi nations decided 
this is what God gives us, we  have to obey 
Hitler. But we thought further, and we t
hought, well, our official governme nt, and our 
queen -- all the hoyal -- royal families always
 crowned by the grace of God. It™s a very 
serious ceremony when they are crowned. A
nd our governme nt was in England, so we 
felt that we had total freedom, and yet obey what
 they told us. And later they told several 
underground to blow up that munition, blow up that bridge, and [indecipherable] 
 

Q: So did you wait?  I mean, how long did it 
take you to decide that when the -- 
 

A: Maybe a few months. 

 

Q: Afewmonths. 

 

A: Because see, we also heard that we were
 a very wealthy country. They paid very low 
taxes because we had Indonesia, with rich, 
rich, it™s got everythi
ng, copper, tin, pewter, 
you call that. And rubber, and oil. So that we
 had -- the royal family of the Netherlands 
was considered one of the w
ealthiest in the Netherlands, 
too. They had [indecipherable] 
that they could take our nati
onal treasury, but they took all 
the gold bars to England, so 
[indecipherable] found nothing, and then -- no, 
we  -- and then the Belgian king, he had 
several palaces, they always had several,
 and then, okay, you stayed here, you go to 
Larpen, I think it was called, and it was a 
big, big garden, giant garden, with a wall 
around it, and you could never speak to these pe
ople. So did he serve them?  No. I mean, 
our queen did really the wisest what she c
ould do. So then that took some  all months 
before they realized it. 
 
Q: And how we re they comm
unicating back?  Did they -- 
 
A: Thegovernme nt?  

 

Q: Yes, well from England. 

 

A: There were secret sendlers
 with the Netherlands, and so 
on. And our mi nisters were all 
there. But then later -- see, in the be
ginning, the resistance, you don™t know where to 
start.  
 

Q: Yeah. 

 

A: I mean, you don™t know. And that were all rea
lly little groups deci
ded some thing has to 
be done, and when they did, some times they [indecipherable] and very much later, years 

later, they got together, and they formed
 the L.O., the Landelijke Organi satie, the 

[indecipherable] and they asked us also to
 be a member, but we
 thought was danger in 
being in a large group, and we had -- we were se
lf-sufficient, we had stolen all the stuff. 
So we said no. We  knew all the people we wo
rked with, and we trusted them, and we 
didn™t take part. But that™s -- 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
27 
 
 
Q: So tell me how -- 
 

A: -- that secret sendler. 

 

Q: Did -- when -- when you saw the Germans co
me  i n, did you very quickly think in your 
head, we have to do some thing, or did it 
take -- did it take 
time  for you to -- 
 

A: No, I reme mber when they ma rched in, I t
hought we have to do anyt
hing to get them out. 
But you didn™t know what yet. But you hated them. 
 

Q: Right. And did you talk with
 friends imme diately, or -- 
 

A: Now, then it happened that they started slow
ly, and I later read that Hitler had told Zize 
Ingort, who we got as governor
, and that was his reward, that
 he had betrayed Austria, 
and that Hitler had told him, the Dutch are 
Aryers, blue-eyes, blonde
 hair, that was his 
ideal, and treat them wit h gloves, because th
ey mi ght want to be a province of Germany. 
Now, when I read that, I la
ughed so hard, I thought he ha
s forgotten one national trait 
here, very stubborn. And that was -- in a ma
rriage it can be a problem, but here it was 
good, so what Hitler told us to do, we didn™t want to do, simply. So now -- and then s -- 

be -- as punishment, because we didn™t obey, we got curfew. Now, we don™t like to be 

told to be home  from 11 to six, so that was 
the fi rst thing that  [i
ndecipherable] us all. 
Then all the transp -- nobody 
had a car, and that was not poverty, only businesses like 
Sears, or whatever, had cu -- big trucks, but
 for the rest, nobody had a car. So we had 
trams, terrific connections in -- in the c
ity, and in all those buses. And it was a few 
pennies, they went every three, four mi
nutes, or you hopped on the tram, stepped over on 
the bus, and there you we re. That was the w
hole -- and then the [indecipherable], of 
course [indecipherable]. But all of a sudden 
the Jewish people weren™t allowed to use 
those any more. And then they started -- theJewish people we ren™t 
allowed to visit the 
non-Jews, so Herman c ouldn™t come any more. 
And we couldn™t visit 
Jewish people. And 
they were telling us then -- because they were
 telling all lies over the papers, and over the 
radio, we di-didn™t even bothe
r any more, we turned BBC, that was the only -- that wa s 
forbidden. And if you still lis
tened, you won™t be -- I alwa
ys tell the kids here, you 
[indecipherable] half the year to jail if
 you caught you listening to the BBC. Now, it™s 
ridiculous to go half a year -- 
and then we still listened, so we had to hand the radios in, 
and it went. So I mean, we got more  and more 
irritated in the [i ndeci
pherable] so and so, 
so have to get out of this country. But th
en, you™d still didn™t
 know what to do, till 
Herman called me  one day, and he said, ﬁDiet,
 I want to see you.ﬂ I said, ﬁTo heck with 
Hitler, you come  to our house.ﬂ He said, ﬁI 
don™t dare.ﬂ Anyway [indecipherable] to my 
house, either. And then we me t somewhere, a
nd that was when the Jewish people started 
to get those papers, you have to leave your
 house, leave everything behind, and it was 
always in the curfew, hours that we Du
tch couldn™t do a thing. And then -- 
 

Q: So the Jews would have to be out during 
curfew to go to We sterbork?  They would be 
sent to We sterbork? 
 

A: Dee -- that was always during the curfew. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
28 
 
 
 
Q: So that no one else would be around? 

 

A: We couldn™t be in the street -- 

 

Q: Isee. 

 

A: -- and we couldn™t ma ke a big riot. And th
ey were allowed -- and you know that from all 
your interviews, they were only allowed to ta
ke a little suitcase fo
r each me mber, with a 
change of clothing, a fork, knife, spoon, cup, and a blanket. 
 

Q: Mm-h m.  

 

A: Now, I me a n, if you think -- and that 
still ma kes me  now furi ous, you know, but you 
think, they have a right to be there. So
me  of the m were there since 1500. They had 
worked, they had done, they had earned thei
r house, they have worked hard, and you 
have not only in money value, but you have
 things that are handed down from fa mily 

tradition, and kids who have pe
ts. I mean, they had to leav
e everything behind, and I was 
saying, what was their crime?  Their crime was 
that they were born Je
wish. And is that a 
crime?  I mean, I would say, that™s what God d
ecides, the color of your
 skin. I could have 
been born in Nigeria and be pitch black. I m
ean, you have nothing to say in that. So it 
was such a terrible injustice, we had never 
seen anything like that
. And I think now the 
people was really -- are getting kind of -- you know, 
it™s just the fact that
 I™ve seen -- it™s 
so horrible. And that night I saw Hein, and 
I told him, and He in had read the book that 
Hitler wrote, Mein Kamp f. And then he said, oh he [indecipherable] because reme mber -- 

and I forgot to tell him that you know that, the 
night that they invade
d our country, that -- 
there was no place in Europe any mor e , there was no place. Ma ny of those German Jews 

committed suicide. And the next da y, I wished I had kept those papers, your heart broke, 

obituaries of father, mother, children, allthe ages, they had all the German Jewish 

[i ndecipherable] and they committed suicide. A
nd that was so horribl e. And then -- then 
Hein and I talked, we said, oh, and [indeciphe
rabl e] Hitler hates them, he™s going to do 
some thing terrible, but we still didn
™t know that they would be killed. 
 

Q: So you™re not hearing anything from Europe, 
because by then they™d attacked Russia, and 
they start killing Jews. Bu
t you haven™t heard anything. 
 

A:  Wa s  t h a t  i n  ™ 4 0?  ™ 4 1?  

 

Q: No. No, no, ™42.  

 

A: No, this is later. But this 
was -- I think that the Jewish pe
ople got their notice the very end 
of ™41, beginning of ™42. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
29 
 
 
A: And we had not heard anything 
about that, that came later, that ™s I think June. The -- this 
was that Herman had to leave, and then we
 said that can™t happen, but what could you 
do?  I mean, I was twen -- 
 
Q: So let -- let me go back for a mo ment. Ther
e™s a big strike in 1941, th
e worker™s strike in 
February.  
 

A: InAmsterdam. 

 

Q: In Amsterdam. Did -- di
 -- you had heard about this? 

 

A: We heard that later, but it was, of course
 not in the papers, alt
hough they shot a lot of 
people, because like here you have now Rums feld, and Cheney, and so -- that when they 

ma rch in our country and they weren™t obeying 
the right way to do things, and we heard -
- I later heard we were the only country wh
ere they did it -- all our own ma yors and 
governme nt people are kicked out and all repl
aced by Nazis. And so [indecipherable] by 

Germans. So that was already unusual. And al
so they took right away, 70 of our top guys, 
and they were put in a prison, but it was a 
big monastery in Bravong. 
And that™s -- it had 
-- it was from the mi ddl e age, had meter th
ick wa lls. And that™s -- and they were 
hostages, and they told us, if you do anythi
ng, those guys will be shot. And they were. 

Some  of them -- so they did, becau
se several of them were shot. 
 

Q: I see. So you -- you have this -- the German
s come  in, so talk between 1940 and ™42. So 
on the one hand, you™re saying that the -- the Dutc
h hate the fact that 
they™re there, want 
them out, and at the same time, it™s very
 difficult to know what you do when you have 
such a force as the Germans were. 
So you™re caught in this dilemma. 
 

A: You -- we didn™t know first what to do. 

 

Q: Uh-huh. 

 

A: But, you know, when this happen, that Herman 
told me  he had to leave, and that™s where 
my religion and Hein™s religion came out in 
the first pl ace. They were the con -- the 
people that God had chosen to bring forth Je
sus, the Messiah, it was for us. In the second 
place, it says in the Bible, who touches them, 
and even if they believe  that Jesus is the 

Messiah [indecipherable] they are the apple of
 God™s eye, and who touches them, touch -- 
touches God™s eye. And then also, we thought it
 was such an injustice, and Jesus said, do 

unto others what you want othe
rs to do unto you. So we felt we had to help, but we didn™t 

know what to. And Hein had read that book, an
d then we got talking, he said, ﬁOh, it™s 
terrible,ﬂ he said, ﬁhe™ll go and do some thi
ng terrible.ﬂ And then all of a sudden Hein 
says, ﬁI have an idea.ﬂ His father was pr
incipal, out in the 
country, in farming 
community, and they were all Christians, and 
all Christian area there. And all those ki ds 
had -- from the farms, ca me  to his school
, and Hein was the oldest of 10 kids 

[indecipherable] I don™t know, [i
ndecipherable] that he was born, probably. He was born 

in the ot her place, but he lived
 there his whole life. And thos
e far mers gave  him all those 
years, the eggs, and they bought the eggs, 
butter, everything. So Hein knew all those 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
30 
 
 
far mers, and also from the kids who came  to school. And Hein says to me , ﬁYou know 
what? If I hop on the trai n, and ask any of those farmers if they will take Herman till the 

war is over, I™m sure they do it.ﬂ And we t
hought, at that time, that
 was [indecipherable] 
times, the war would last a year, ma ybe a year 
and a half. So -- and then I called Herman, 
and I said, ﬁHerma n, we have an idea.ﬂ And 
I met him again. And he said, ﬁYes, please.ﬂ 
He said, ﬁAnd can you do my sister, too, Rosa, sh
e is so scared.ﬂ And I said, ﬁWhat about 
your parents? ﬂ Because I knew -- he
 said no, my parents say -- 
and this is really ironic, 
ﬁGerma ny is an -- an civilized country, and it 
won™t be so bad, we probably have to work 
hard, and how long will the war will last,ﬂ -- 
we all thought it would be short -- and then 
come  back. And they did not want to go in 
hiding, and not be a bother to others. But 
Herman said he was dating a Jewish girl, and 
the father had already died, thanks to the 
Germans, and the mo -- she was an only child, and he says, ﬁAda is scared, and her 

mother is scared.ﬂ So that was four. And then
 all of a sudden, they spread the news, and I 
think within two or th
ree weeks we have a list of ove
r 60. And we -- Hein went to the 
far ms, and they didn™t know me  then, but he 
went, and they all said, ﬁSure, sure, send 
them, send them.ﬂ And that™s how it started.  
 

Q: So how come people were so willing, di 
-- were the -- the Nazis 
not in the north?  We re 
they not occupying Friesland? 
 

A: Theywere. 

 

Q: They were there. And then but -- 

 

A: But that was in hiding. And we didn™t bri
ng them to Friesland, we bought them to the 
mi ddle of the country Nijkerk, that is
 -- I don™t know if you have a ma p -- 
 

Q: Yeah,yeah. 

 

A: -- but I have a ma p of the Netherlands. 

 

Q: Right. 

 

A: It™s a bit east of Amersfoort. 

 

Q: Yes. 

 

A: And there, see our country, the south [indeciphe
rable] is mostly Catholics, and they did it, 
too, and north of [indecipherable] are mostly 
the Pr otestant. And -- so -- and Hein knew 
all those people, and they were all from -- I 
didn™t know they sent 
their children to the 
Christian schools, and so -- and they were -- 
 

Q: And they didn™t hesitate? 

 

A: No. They thought it was just norma l, nobody -- 
I really -- I can s
till not understand why 
here in America, I feel so metimes very unc
omfortable because  I tell here my story, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
31 
 
 
you all think it™s terrific. A
nd I™ll tell you, I wouldn™t dare
 to tell my story in the 
Netherlands, they would shrug their s
houlders and say so what, you did it 
[indecipherable]. No, honest, I t
hought everybody I me t at that time  was in the resistance, 
so I thought the whole Netherlands wa s 
in the resistance. [indecipherable] 
 
Q: But that™s not true. 

 

A: No, because this high governme nt guy later told
 me, he says that in
 the first place, that 
our denomination was the most. And then he
 asked me , ﬁ Who do you think is the second 

group? ﬂ  And I thought, well we have the sa
me  [indecipherable] ma ybe you know the 
Communists. And that™s true, you have to
 be on fire for what you believe -- 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: -- and they were. So that is really in
teresting. You know, we didn™t think it was so 
special, you know?  It was just what you had to do.  
 

Q: But you knew it was dangerous. And certainly
 the farmers had to 
know it was dangerous, 
be -- 
 

A: Now, they -- you know, in the beginning,we didn™t know how far -- who the Gestapo 
was. 
 

Q: Youdidn™t? 

 

A: No, you did not realize how -- but then you f
ound out also, that they had officially black 
uniforms, and they were me n and wome n, and a
ll ages, and most of them didn™t wear the 
black uniform, they were dressed like you and 
I. So you had to really watch out what you 
say, to whom, because I could say to -- well, fo
r instance, the -- for th
e first time executed 
18 guys. Now we were shocked, shocked. I don™t know if you™ve read that poem of -- oh, 

that is so beautiful, the 18 -- that was a -- a 
-- a poet who was shot the next morning. I can 
never read it without starting to cry. But 
when that happened, you know, we were so 
shocked, and then we realized you had to watch 
out if you said to anot
her girl, isn™t that 
horrible from the 18 guys, and sh
e was a Nazi [indecipherable] 
 

Q: Wow.  

 

A: -- you didn™t know the person real good [ind
ecipherable] terrible 
things like that. 
 

Q: Did you have to worry about some  of your friends? 

 

A: Well,me? 

 

Q: Or people you thought you were f -- who 
-- who you thought were friends?  That must 
have -- 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481

A: I found that out because this -- there were 
two girls that we always
 went jumping over the 
ditches, they were from my church, and th
ey were -- one was my age, one was a year 
younger, and their brother was a year younger ag
ain, Daniel, and we were all -- and then 
my brother was friends with 
Daniel, and we were as a 
whole group together. And we 
went together to catechism, went to churc
h, and to everything. A
nd it was the habit after 
church that the parents -- my parents had frie
nds, and they came  one Sunday to our house 
for coffee, and then the other Sunday there. 
But those friends and 
I we s -- we played 
piano quartre ma in, four hands, and so one 
Sunday it was in their house, and we had fun, 
and until dinnertime , and the next Sunday in 
our house. And when I 
-- I think I told you 
that there -- there was nothing for the soldiers
, that they had invite
d the pulpits and so 
come  to our house, so we had Dutch soldiers. 
And they were like brot
her and sister, and I 
said, ﬁAre you going to do it? ﬂ  
And they said no, we havefive kids, it™s too busy, we 
don™t do it. And the first Sunday after the war 
it was in our house, 
and the second Sunday 
I went to their house, and I couldn™t believe it.
 You had to go up the stairs, and then over 
the piano was a big portrait of Hitler. And 
you had those doors that were gliders, that 
opened -- they had double doors, 
and I heard in the other room Ger man s peaking, and I 
look, and I see German soldiers. So then I knew that they were all Nazi. And I had right 
away, after the war, I™m always a fanatic, 
I bought a little flag, and like now you see over 
[indecipherable] after 11/7, that I put it on 
my [indecipherable]. And I was  so shattered 
when I saw that, and I said to them, ﬁAs long as
 this hangs in this house, I can™t set a foot 
here.ﬂ And I turned around and I went downsta
irs to get my bag. And I think Daniel had 

told me , the flag of my r e ich, so he didn™t 
even feel Dutch any more. And I heard later 
that Daniel fought at the [ind
ecipherable], so he was not just in name , and both the girls 
went to Germany and se rved there with [indecipherable]  
 

Q: Really? 
 
A: [indecipherable] m- mi ce, very [indecipherable] 

 

Q: Now, were they in the Malakka Club? 

 

A: They were also in that group, yeah. 

 

Q: In -- in that club, at
 first [indecipherable] 
 

A: We had such a fun -- I couldn™t be -- I wrot
e a letter to them, I™ve never mailed it, I wrote 
it in my diary, but I was shatte
red, absolutely shattered. I coul
dn™t believe it. But see, then 
later I realized when we me
t those Nazis [indecipherable] at the border, they were 
[indecipherable]. And my brother 
later said, ﬁDiet, you guys neve
r s -- talked politics, but 
I was in dan -- Daniel™s room, and he had a 
lot of stuff from Germany [indecipherable]ﬂ. 
So my brother was not surprised. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: But I never knew, never talked about it. 
And we had [indecipherab
le], and ma ny pastors 
who spoke out on the pulpit, and priests, too, were arrested. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
33 
 
 
 
Q: Right. Now, the Dutch governme nt opened 
Westerbork as a refugee camp because there 
were so ma ny refugees comi ng in. 
 

A: The Nazi Dutch. 

 

Q: The Nazi Dutch. 

 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: Yes. And this was when? In 1939, in 1940? 

 

A: No, it was after the war. 

 

Q: It was after the war. 

 

A: Because before it was really a camp for 
-- see, there was such an unemployment, and 
people got their money, but they wanted them to do some thing. And so they had several 

work camps, that the guy who got mo neyfrom the governme nt could do some thing 

useful, let™s say in a very watery
 place, they were r
eally filling with earth that it could be 
used for growing stuff or some thing, you 
have so many more -- more s -- more 

[indecipherable] or some thing. And so the -- 
it was originally a wo
rk camp for the -- for 
the -- 
 

Q: Forrefugees? 

 
A: -- people who were getting welfare. 
 

Q: But-- 

 

A: And then they had leave, and they 
could go home . Then they are rebuilding 
[indecipherable], and only that
 [indecipherable] or ma ny more  of those worked, and 
[indecipherable] and whatever.  
 

Q: And so when does it be come  a place 
where they se nd Jews, after the war? 
 

A: Where they sent the Jews? 
 
Q: Yes. 

 

A: I think that mi ght have been the end of ™40, 
when then they started telling them to go to 
Germany, a nd they didn™t go. And that was al
so th -- because the Jews from The Hague 

had to report to a big station in The Ha gue, 
and they went in [indecipherable] but then, 
like me with Herman, and so there were a 
bunch who didn™t go, and others in the area 
where that  camp was, I think they were told to go there. And then twice a week 

[indecipherable] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
34 
 
 
 
Q: And what -- did Herman say what he was 
afraid of?  Why wouldn™t he go to We sterbork?  
Did he have a sense that some th
ing terrible was going to happen? 
 

A: Yeah, th-that the German Jews committed suicide [i ndecipherable] that told us a lot. And 
we had over the years heard about the Krista
llnacht, so we knew that Hitler -- it was not 
just any more words, before we thought it™s
 a big mouth, and words, but now they were 

doing. 
 

Q: But you still don™t know th
at they™re killing Jews? 
 

A: No. 

 

Q: Noidea? 

 

A: I really think I found 
that out after the war. 
 

Q: Uh-huh. So no rumors even comi ng through? 

 

A: We heard that there were -- no, that it was 
very bad, and that ma ny 
people died, but we 
thought of hunger, and of dysentery, and of sic
knesses. But that they 
were systematically 
killed -- 
 

Q: You had no idea. 

 

A: But I read a lot of books, and I think this is
 [indecipherable] Mila 18, 
that they think that 
people escaped [indecipherable], and I just go
t a few weeks ago, and I was shattered, and 
that was from a ma n, a real ma n, ma ybe you 
-- oh, what was his name , Kurt some thing, 
and he was [indecipherable] Christian in German
y, and he hated it, and he had to be a mi  
-- of the party, a me mber of th
e party to get a job, and he s
poke out, and he was kicked of 
the party. And he got more and more [indeciphe
rable] of the evil of 
the Nazi system. And 
yet, how can I actually do some thing?  And he
 signed up with the SS, but every job that 
he had done -- I [indecipherable] to 
give you the name , because it™s -- 
 

Q: It™sGerstein. 

 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: Yeah, Kurt Gerstein. 

 

A: Oh. 

 

Q: Yeah, it™s quite a story. 

 

A: Oh. And you ne -- he even got to th
e Pope, and the Pope didn™t do a thing. 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
35 
 
 
Q: Mm-h m.  
 

A: And I think they got me ssages to England, 
to America, and nobody believed them. I can™t 
be -- oh.  
 

Q: Do you remember befor e  Herman ge ts his le
tter that Jews had to
 wear a star. Do you 
reme mber seeing -- 
 

A: Yeah, that™s what -- at the same time that 
they weren™t allowed to use the -- the trams, 
and the trains and everything any mo re. 
 

Q: Right. So it™s -- I think it™s difficult for 
people to understand how re
stricted life not only 
became for you, but even more so for the Jews, 
they couldn™t go to parks, they couldn™t 
go to -- be on the tram, e xcept -- they c
ouldn™t even go on the tram at all, right? 
 

A: No. 

 

Q: No. 

 

A: N-No. And they weren™t allowed to go in
 parks, to concerts, they weren™t allowed 
anywhere, except they weren™t allowed t-to s
hop in the big stores, 
only their own Jewish 
stores, which of course got hardly any in supply. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: No, it was really -- it was terrible. But la
ter [indecipherable] I c 
-- I coul d identify with 
when they were looking for me , you know, th
at you couldn™t go here and there, and 
whatever, so -- I don™t know. 
Oh, it was a terrible thing, a
nd that really happened.  
 

Q: What are you seeing in your eyes, right now? 

 

A: Well, I can™t understand really, that one hum
an be ing can do [indecipherable] to another 
huma n being I mean, how hard would you have
 gotten inside?  And then I heard that 
those [indecipherable] Germans who -- because 
here you are in a country where there is 
justice, it mi ghtn™t always be
 carried out like we want to, and we™ve ma de  mi stakes, but 
the idea is a judge has to give a sentence th
at™s according to [indeci
pherable], and here -- 
and we can™t understand it, you were totally
 dependent on the guy who did your hearing, 
on his mood. If he had -- that morning had 
burned toast, he might sentence everybody to 
death that day. I mean, you were totally in 
their hands, and you had no -- there were no 
right, there was no right. It™s so
 terrible. And that you always
 have to watch out what you 
say, to whom you say it. It™s against a
nything that™s freedom
. It™s terrible.  
 

Q: We have to change the tape. 

 

A: Okay, you got a [indecipherable] again.

Tape #4 
 
Q: When Her man came to you, and you and Hein talked about what to do, you had already 
started a group of 
some kind, right? 
 

A: We were -- 

 

Q: Or the -- actually the HEIN group -- 

 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: -- although it™s not have
 anything to do with -- 
 

A: No, we were the -- I -- in the office wh
ere I worked, there was ma  -- one man who was 
really fanatic patriot, and you know, I know wh
at he did is -- we
 listened to the BBC 
news, and we took shorthand, and we typed it 
out and spread it, that™s what we felt we  

could do for the people who were scared and 
handed in their radios. And also, I know 
that this guy always took part
 of the Bible, and say, read th
at, and it was always from the 
Old Testament, you know, punishme nt, people who 
attacked Israel. So it was kind of a -- 
a stimulants, you know, y -- we do God™s will,
 because in the Old Testament was -- 
anyway it was the -- we were with a gr
oup, and there was an other ma n, and he was 
ma rried to a Jewish lady, and 
he never -- that was the uncle 
of Herman, and he was also 
starting to be interest ed 
in helping those people. 
 

Q: Is that Ben? 

 
A: His name  was Uncle Frits. 
 

Q: UncleFrits. 

 

A: He™s probably -- Ohm Fr its, he™s -- 

 

Q: Uh-huh. That™s F-r-i-t-s, yes? 

 

A: Yeah, and he was -- we -- we were discussi
ng what can we do, but 
till that  time, really, 
the only thing we felt is spread
 the ne -- noi -- news of th
e BBC. But then, when they 
started on our Jews, n -- we knew was more i m
portant stuff to do. We
 still did that, but 
when we hid the Jews -- but then, it becam
e difficult because an -- at the same ti me, 
because the Germans were occupying all Euro
pe, and they had also drafted the wome n, 
they mi ght be the first. But in Germany its
elf were only very old 
people, and very young 
people. And the war industry was going full blast, and the fields need to be worked, and 

there were no of that age group. So then, in
 all the occupied count
ries, you mi ght have 
heard that in Norway, and in France pr
obably too, but was always a handsome young 
ma n, with beautiful white teeth, blonde hair
, big, blue eyes, come
 to Germany, terrific 
pay. And that was on the walls, and in the pa
pers everywhere. And 
there was a lot of 
unemployment, but we didn™t want to go to 
Germany. And then, at the same  ti me , that 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
38 
 
 
was when they started on the Jewish pe
ople, and because the people didn™t go to 
Germany, because we didn™t want to go to th
e country where -- a few will always go, for 
money, you know, but that™s a small percentage
. And then they got ma d, and they said 
okay, you didn™t come  when we invited you, now it™s forced labor. And every ma le 

between 16 and 45 had to go, except from the 
Catholic church, a priest, and from the 
Protestant church, the pa stor
s, and some teachers didn™t ha
ve  to go, but a bunch had to 
go, because what they did, the people didn™tgo, and then they surrounded, for instance, a 

high school. Now, there are always boys of 16 
- 17. So they went in the morning happily 
to school and never came home, they were sent
 to Germany. And the universities were all 
in that age group, so they were surrounded, 
and we had ma ny Jewish professors, they 
have brains, and they were very beloved, and 
they were kicked out of their jobs, they 
weren™t allowed to have their 
jobs any more, so their student
s went on strike, and all -- 
they were -- so all the students, if they 
were -- they surrounded the university, and they 
were -- so then everything closed. And so 
only girls went to school, and the university 
were closed, also out of protest, strike . So 
some  of the teachers had to go to -- and then 
they still didn™t want to go, 
so a lot -- just think that in America, every male between 16 
and 45 has to go in hiding, and that™s what
 happened. And they went in hiding, but a 
small group didn™t know where to go, mostly so
mewhere in your circle of fa mily or 
friends, there is some body where you can go and hide. But those guys couldn™t come  in 

the street any more, because you didn™t 
know if you saw a young ma n or a woma n that 
they were Ge stapo, so they we
re -- they really had to go 
in hiding. But the thing was, 
because nobody went to Germany to work ther
e, in the fields -- there was hunger in 
Germany, a nd they loaded in all the countries
 the trains full, and the food went all to 
Germany, a nd we had very little. So they 
started a ration system with coupons, I have 
some  in my -- you probably have seen them. 
But anyway -- but the only way you got the 
coupons, and they lasted a month -- it was about 
a card this size, and it was so little, a 
German guy with an appetite wouldn™t even 
have anything to eat. 
And it was very little, 
but you only got it when you went
 to those offices. And ther
e were Dutch people working 
but the supervision all was kicked out, a
nd all repl aced by Germans. And you only got 
your new card -- your new sou -- coupons if
 you showed your I.D. So those young me n 
between 16 and 45 never could get coupons ag
ain. And the farmers, because you know in 
[indecipherable] they helped their own group, 
they did not help others, really, only the 
dental family -- the dentist family. But 
ma ny, Corrie ten Boom, were hiding Jewish 
people, and ma ny groups were hiding, ma
ny. Catholics, and Protestants, and 
Communists, everybody. So, but those guys --the far mers had already -- who dared to, 

had taken Jews, but then we had to go to 
villages and cities and say, will you take a 
Dutch guy. And that was considered less danger
ous than taking a Jewish person. But they 
told us we can™t, because we know they don™
t get ration cards, and 
my own kid is asking 
for another slice of bread we can™t give him,
 and a potato. We  can™t feed an extra mouth. 
If you don™t have ration cards, th
en they don™t get it. And then from some  other group, 
you know, at that time -- now people travel, but at  that time, if a far mer and his wife lived 

here, and they had two sons, 
then they got farms close by. 
They all stayed close by. And 
nobody traveled, and all the ma il they got mi ghthave been a bank statement, and a per -- 

some thing of their church, but they didn™t ge
t any other ma il. And here we also ma de a 
big mi stake, we put a father and mother here
, and a son there, and 
a daughter there, and 
they started writing each other. And that wa
s for the ma il ma n who delivered it, and the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
39 
 
 
second letter, or the third letter, you have 
some body here?  And that was suspicious. And 
then, this was big news, there was no television 
at that time, the radio was va -- so Farmer 
so and so gets all the time mail, so th
en they ma ybe think, do you have some body, you 
get all the time mail, I hear fr om the ma
ilman. So they got scared, and some  were 
arrested, farmers, and they have -- 
 
Q: Some  of the far mers were arrested? 

 

A: Yeah, because they had also a side -- see 
they -- we had such a well registered country, 
every family in every village, in wherever you lived, had a card system in every town 

hall. And if a baby was born, the father had to 
go to the town hall, and say there™s a new 
baby, this name  and that and that, and that 
went in a card system. And if s o me body died, 

you had to go, a card was taken ou
t. If a whole family moved to another city, that -- you 
had to report it, and the whole 
-- but that card system, at th
at time -- now they can™t do it 
any more, but everything was on it. Your 
faith, your religion, your
 job, your whatever 
you were, your age. So they had all the Jewish
 fing -- on their fingertip
s, that they knew 
exactly how ma ny Jews we had. And of course, 
then they saw that they were not showing 
up in the amount they had to show up, so th
ey got ma d. And everyw
here, like -- with -- 
for the labor, there were signs, if you help 
a Jew, you -- you will be tr
eated as a Jew. So 
then the farmers -- and some were betrayed 
because of the mail, 
and they got scared, 
because the I.D.s, the identific
ation cards that we all had to have the end of ™44, the 
beginning of ™41, that had a big, fat, black J 
printed on it, too. And they had gone to the 
far ms with this thing, and then the farmers came 
to us, and they said, Diet -- or, I had fal -

- the false name  then, ﬁDiet, can you get us I.D.s without a J, be -- if 
there ever is a raid 
on our farm, that we can say, we didn™t know
 they were Jewish, we thought they were 
city people who were hungry, came here fo
r being -- for better food.ﬂ And then the 
people in the city said, ﬁWe will take the Du
tch guys if you had ration cards.ﬂ And then 
we were in a bind, because you know, by that
 time, I think we had hidden about 80 
Jewish people all over. And th
is -- the farmers were scared. We  got together, we were a 

real small group, and we knew all each othe
r from long ago, and we were a Christian 
group, and we went on our knees, and we prayed to God, and we had -- Lord, we can™t 

just now say good luck and find your own 
way. We have to go on, but now we don™t 
know what to do any mo re. And I reme mber I always was jealous of Moses, he got a 

manna from he -- and he got water from the 
rock, but the heavens did not open, and we 
did not get a whole bunch of cards. And thenthe only way to get it was to take it, 

because, you know, there was no othe r way out, 
and it was really life and death for those 
people. So then, after praying, it became  clear to us, we had to do a robbery on the 

German offi ces. Until that time , if you treated 
-- helped a Jew, you we
re treated as a Jew, 
but if you did a robbery on the German office,
 that was the death penalty. And when I 
speak for high schools, or universities, I always
 say when I say this, ﬁThis is not advice 
kids,ﬂ I said, ﬁbut if you do an
 ar -- a robbery, you better ha
ve arms , and revolvers.ﬂ And 

th-the British had, over our lakes, dumped at
 night, you know, big containers full of -- we 
had weapons, the resistance, but having a weapon
 was the death penalt
y. So then it really 
became dangerous, and there were a few brav
e guys that were called the knockploegs, k-
n-o-c-k ploeg. And they volunteered to do th
at, every month again. And we found always 
a village, or a some wher e, where we knew 
some body was working, sa -- a Dutch person 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481

was good, and that we can ma ke a dra -- a dr
awing, where are the gua
rds [indecipherable] 
a guard, how ma ny, is -- how is it locked, youknow, that they had to
 shoot it open. But 
that -- before they went in, 
that they knew the whole situation. And then before -- 
 
Q: This wa --was this your group, or this
 is another group that
™s stealing for you? 
 

A: That -- were three guys
 who did it for all groups. 
 

Q: For all groups?  Only three guys? 

 

A: Well, later --  I knew three -- 

 

Q: Uh-huh. 

 

A: But I -- there were more, and one later was 
arrested, and he was te
rrible tortured. And I 
think then some body else, you know -- 
 

Q: Tookover. 

 

A: -- there were ma ny guys who were willing to do that. 

 

Q: Well, let me  go back for a mo ment. When Hein says I can go -- where are you -- you 
know, and find far mers, did he go to people he knew? 
 

A: Hein? 

 
Q: Yes. 
 

A: For the farmers, yeah, all people -- 

 

Q: In that area. So everyone at -- so
 he would just knock on the door -- 
 

A: He went to those farmers, and then he had 
his best friend Ab, they were our two leaders, 
and Ab was eight years older. And he had 
a job, he was a representative for a grain 
company, and Ab knew a whole other bunch of pe ople. See, Hein knew the parents of the 

children, but Ab knew all his customers, and he had a big territory. 
 

Q: Isee. 

 

A: So he knew ma ny places, and -- 

 

Q: And Ab™s name , his full name  is Ab -- 

 

A: AlbertvanMeerveld. 

 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
41 
 
 
 
A: And was a street in hi s village in Barnevel
d name d after him, he was also killed. And -- 
 

Q: So these two, Hein and Ab were the two leaders of the group? 

 

A: Ab -- were the two leaders of our group. 

 

Q: And how many of you were in the group, do you think? 

 

A: Now later, see, they were -- some  were arrest ed -- 

 

Q: Yeah. 

 

A: -- and later we were around 15. 

 

Q: 15. 

 

A: And we had two places, Nijkerk and Barnevel
d, it was the ones that -- was Zwijndrecht, 
near Dorduf that was the other group. And 
we me t each ot her, and then we kind of 
me rged. The y were decima ted, we were decima
ted, and then together, but we always kept 
contact, but -- from the Zwijndrecht group, they
 did a lot in spying, and they got really 
order from England to blow
 up munitions stuff and so. 
 

Q: Right. Now, when you brought people to th
e farms, did you expect some how everything 
would be okay?   
 
A: No. 
 

Q: You didn™t? Because you had an enormous
 amount of work to do in terms of -- 
 

A: Oh, I reme mber I had once to bring a very
 Orthodox Jews from The Hague to Duchorn, 
that is a village outside Apeldoorn. I ha
d -- the man could have been, you know, in 
children™s Bi bles, you see Father Abraham, 
real Jewish looking, oh he looked like that. 
Was written all over him Jew. And of -- in the fi
rst place, the stem had to -- star had to go 
out. And this ma n was Orthodox, and later I 
learned he had his Tallit, you know, his 
prayer thing in his pocket and he
 lost it, and he wanted to go 
back for it, oh. I had to twice 
change trains. Miracles happened, because I ha
d to bring him, his wife, and his 16 ye ar 

old son first to Utrecht, there we had to switc
h to a train to Amersfoort. In Amersfoort we 
had to switch to a train to Apeldoorn, and 
then we had to walk I don™t know how ma ny 
miles to a -- a hotel that was in the w
oods, and the people had -- nobody had money any 

more, so they were totally broke, they had not
hing. So Hein and Ab went there, and they 

said -- they fi rst sends them out if th
ey were good, and they were good, you know, that 
they were por the Netherlands, and not N
azi. And they said, well we can give you 
customers, and we will pa y for that, and they have the ration cards and everything. And it 

was so isolated, so we could 
bring a whole lot of Jewish pe
ople there, but on a Sunday. I 
was still working in my office, I had to br
ing this guy. And he had a suitcase so heavy, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
42 
 
 
that I don™t know -- have you ever read that an 
accident happens, and that it was in the -- 
in the paper some  ti me  ago, and it has happe
ned several times, and that one woma n is 
under the car, and the other woma n passed, and it 
was life or death and she lifted the car, 
have you ever heard of such thing? 
 
Q: Yeah. 

 

A: Now, I said a prayer. I couldn™t get that suitcas
e, I said, ﬁGod, this is 
all they have in this 
right world,ﬂ and I could lift that suitcase, 
I don™t know how. And then in -- then we si -- 
went from one train to the other, the guy loses 
his Tallit, and he wanted to go back, I said 
-- I told him beforehand, I said, ﬁListen, you sit he
re.ﬂ Martin, his son had to sit there, and 
his wife there, and I am there. I said, and 
if you are -- I gave him a newspaper, I said, 
ﬁThe whole trip, keep that in front of your f
ace, because that is,ﬂ 
-- and I said, ﬁif you are 
arrested there is no point that [indecipherabl
e] and I go on with your wife and son.ﬂ But 
these were horrible things. And we got there, 
oh, and then I we nt to my sister, and we had 
to walk, and we walked into the woods, oh, no, and another night they had told that if I 

came at 11 PM at the certain station, again 
Amersfoort, there would be a cab, or a car, 
and two elderly people, and there was nobody. 
Oh, no, no, it was -- it was more a mi racle 

if it went all right. 
It was a mi racle. 
 

Q: I would imagine it was, because you have 
people™s lives in your hands all the time. How 
did you bring -- let™s just talk 
about Herman for a mo ment. Herm
an gets a card to go to 
Westerbork. How ma ny days 
does he have?  A few days? 
 

A: He had quite awhile. 

 
Q: He did have? 
 

A: Because then he was really not ready, and he
 told Rosa, and I still see Rosa all the time, 
she is a sweetheart, she™s now -- she™s a few y
ears older than I am. And s he says I -- just 
when I heard it I said, I will 
go. And so she was really the first one, although we had 
offered it to Herman, and she went alone to 
Ame r sfoort, and there they picked her up and 
brought her to the farm. And she was there a l
ong time, but then became  the -- she sor -- 
she was wandering a lot, and then here, and th
en there, and she was really half dating a 
non-Jewish guy, and later she was in the part
 in Zwijndrecht. But she said, ﬁ When I 
closed the door behind me , I really had no 
idea that I never s -- would see my parents 
again, and how dangerous it would be.ﬂ You know
 we -- we -- we all underestimated the 
danger, I think, and mayb
e it was a good thing. 
 

Q: Maybe, because ma ybe you wouldn™t have
 done it if you really knew the danger. 
 

A: That™s what I don™t know. I think later we we
re willing to [indeciphera
bl e] so that we will 
be [indecipherable] they were 
looking for me  under two name
s. And then I was arrested 
on my third name , and I knew if they found 
out who I really wa s, was the end. And you 
know, I can honestly say, and this sound crazy, 
I have three times I -- that I thought it™s 
the end of my life, and I was so young, and 
at home  my wedding dress wa s hanging. And 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
43 
 
 
I think you get a special grace from God, you can
 say it™s okay. And that™s a way when 
it™s over, because sometimes I thing now I™m 
not  as close to God as I was then, but I 
think when it™s my time, I™ll get it again. 
You know, it™s -- but I think when you really 
feel you have to, you want to live like God 
wants you to live, that™s
 -- and you just do it 
and trust. Well, it™s not always easy to do 
the right things, that™s what I tell the young 
kids when I go to schools and universities, th
at whole life™s making choices. You every 
day will do a fork in the road, and I say pick the ri ght road. And that mi ght ask sacr ifices. 
And I had to speak for the Air Force Academ
y in Colorado Springs, 
about two and a half 
years ago, or three years ago, and I said to 
those guys, I said, ﬁIn the profession you have 
chosen, it might easily be that you have to 
ma ke the highest sacrif
ice, your life.ﬂ And I 
think, who knows now [i ndeciphera
ble] how ma ny of those guys
 have already given that 
sacrifice. 
 

Q: But your belief in God during that wa rtime period when you started -- 

 

A: Ohyeah. 

 

Q: -- was absolutely essential to you.  

 

A: I can tell you, if I had [indecipherable] Ps
alms , oh, David went thr
ough everything in this 
life. And when I read those Psalms  
you know, I thought oh, I don™t know, there is a 
Psalm 27, the lord is my light and my  salv ation, whom shall I fear, and I thought, yeah, 

that™s scary. I was fee -- and then it said, 
when an army comes against me -- because 
David was fleeing for Saul, and then he wrot
e it, and he said, when an army come s up 
against me, he will put me on a rock, and he will hide me [i ndecipherabl e] and I also, I 

always knew that™s what God is doing with me
, I mean really I shouldn™t be sitting here, 
so ma ny of my friends were killed, so I feel 
that I was spared for a purpose, and you have 
to find a purpose, and have the 
time  all to see the purpose. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: I have to try. 

 

Q: Did you read the Bible during th
is period, or did you know so much? 
 

A: No, you did -- not allowed to have anything, 
so it™s good that in our church we had -- we 
went to the Christian school, and every Monday 
morning we had to learn a little part of 
the Psalms , so Monday -- Su-Sunday night, I 
could easily learn, so my par e nts didn™t 
have to bother, but later I was -- you know, we
 hated all that we had to do that. And 
[indecipherable], oh, what a lucky thing because it came all back to me . 
 

Q: It came back. 

 

A: You know, I -- I -- I would have gone absolu
tely -- I think I would have been in 
[i ndecipherable] in an institution if I [i ndecipherable]  
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
44 
 
 
Q: If you didn™t have the -- 
 

A: Because later, in that concentrati
on camp [indecipherable] it was impossible. 
 

Q: So Diet, tell me  -- I don™t know, th-there wa
sn™t a norma l day, but once the people, th -- 
these Jewish fa milies are put, either si ngly 
or together, on a farm, then what is your 
responsibility, and the responsibility of
 your group?  What did you have to do? 
 

A: Now, we br ought the ma il along, because th
at wa s what they were living on, the ma il 
from their children, we -- so, because  the po -- 
 

Q: So they didn™t go through the normal 
mail system because it was too dangerous? 
 

A: No, because that was so suspicious for th
e ma ilman, and then also, the Gestapo opened if 
they thought that some body is suspicious, they
 opened the ma il, so that was double. And 
I had to see that every month, even if it was at the far m, the food was scarce, and bad, so 

they still wanted raf -- the ration cards, so 
after the robberies, we had to see every month, 
with every Jewish, and if it was very poor peopl
e, we gave them two cards or so. And we 
had to, if an address became  unsa fe, you had to find another place and transport them. 

And that one Jewish guy, who was our falsifie
r, in norma l life he had been a draftsma n, 
and he was terrific, he falsified everythi
ng, so he had a room with his wife -- 
 

Q: Is this Ben? 

 

A: [indecipherable] where I later was a lot. 

 
Q: Wha -- what was his name ?  Wa s it -- 
 

A: His name  was Uncle Ben. 

 

Q: Ben,uh-huh. 

 

A: Uncle Ben, yeah. Kanis was their last 
name . And he was very good, and I was often 
there, because this one ha d to have a new pa
per, and that one had to new paper, so we 
were constantly busy. And at the farms, you kno
w, that was very smart because they had 
little kids. And the neighbors, the doors were
 always open, you walk in and out. So the 
little kids we re told to say, neighbor, we 
have buurma n, that™s the ma n, and buurvrouw, 
that™s the wo ma n, you say here neighbor. But it wa
s just so if the little
 kids talked about 
the neighbors, the -- the real neighbors didn™t really -- were
 not surprised because they 
thought, oh, they™re talking about that -- you kno
w, you had to think of everything when 
you had little kids. 
 

Q: How often would you go to these farms?  

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
45 
 
 
A: At least once a month, but mostly more. 
And because you know, for the cards, but at 
some  -- and also, I was allowed to sleep there, 
so even if I had nothing to do there, but I 
was in that area, then I could always sl
eep in, on the bed some where [indecipherable] 
 
Q: Was it easier for a woman to 
be traveling around doing this? 
 

A: Yeah, the men could always be stopped fo
r the forced labor. And so after the first 
robbery, because all our me n we
re in that age group -- 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: -- Hein was, I think, 22 probably, his brothe
r was a year younger, 23, and Ab was in his 
30™s. So they would right away have been -- 
so, but after the first robbery, we could give 
-- all the Jews went without a J, and Uncl
e Ben was working like crazy. And all our guys 
took also new, and they were all pastors, so we -- 
 

Q: They were all pastors. 

 

A: Because they didn™t ha ve  to go to Ge rmany. So then, when they were stopped in the train, 
and it happened regularly, they were 
pastors, so then they could go on. 
 

Q: So if there were 15 people in your gr
oup, did all 15 go around gi
ving out these -- the 
ration cards, and the I.D. papers? 
 

A: Well, I worked ma inly in -- in Felmal
oond, around Amersfoort and 
Utrecht. But in the 
south they had other things too, because they 
were really -- yeah, I know that there they 
got orders from England, that was a secret 
sender that they had 
to blow up a munition 
depot, or a bridge, or some thing. So they did 
also Jewish people, but
 they -- they spread 
it. Some  they [indecipherable] and that was -- 
 

Q: But that -- this was a totally di
fferent group, that 
wasn™t your group? 
 

A: No, we me r ged -- 

 

Q: Your group was -- 

 

A: Weme rged. 

 

Q: That was the group you me rged with? 

 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: But you didn™t want to 
do anything that was -- 
 

A: I didn™t want to do any killing. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
46 
 
 
Q: Anykilling. 
 

A: No. 

 

Q: Orsabotage. 

 

A: And when we were in the beginning, they as
ked us -- they asked us tha -- Hein had to go 
right away in hiding in 1940 
already. And he was put in a house, and the girl was 
engaged, they said, to an Italian. And then al
l of a sudden another guy 
said that Italian is 
pro-Nazi, that™s dangerous. So then they 
brought Hein to another house, and that guy -- 
anyway, they said that Italian was dangerous
, and they asked us -- that was a Communist 
group, and they asked us to stab him on a dark 
night in the back, and kill him, and throw 
him in a canal. And we were not convinced th
at you have to be -- I could do -- I couldn™t 
do it, but I could let a guy from
 the -- who had the guns, I could ask him, and then they 
will do it. But I wasn™t convinced that he was 
such a traitor. But later they asked me in 
the German interview, if you absolutely had kno
wn that™s a traitor, and he asked, ﬁCould 
you then have?ﬂ I said, not myself, but then I 
-- if I [indecipherable] you, he would betray 
a lot of people, and had betrayed, th
en I could say yes [indecipherable] 
 

Q: So you could get some one else to kill him?  

 

A: Because ho-how ma ny lives would be saved then, you know? 

 

Q: Right,right. 

 

A: So. No, I -- I just wanted to -- but it ha
d to be done now and then. It™s terrible.  
 

Q: Were you working at the same  ti me  you were in the resistance? 

 

A: No, in ™43, H-Hein asked me , I think the end of
 ™42, he says -- in The Hague, he says, ﬁI 
have me t a guy, and he is also with a group.ﬂ He 
said, ﬁand he has an address ra -- that is 
desperate,ﬂ and he says to me , ﬁdon™t you go ther
e.ﬂ He says, ﬁbut it™s very dangerous,ﬂ it 

was in the heart of The Hague, he says, ﬁa
nd they won™t even le
t you in that house, you 
have to have a password.ﬂ So 
he give me  the password. So
 I went there with it -- the 
password, and if you think that we had two you 
-- Jews on this farm, and one there, and 
one there, all spread out, and I reme mber Ihad to go up the stairs, and I say the password, 

and they let me  in, and that was a house, 
a little apartment in the mi ddle of a big 
apartment house, and it was built for one person, one living room, one bedroom, a shower 

and a bath, a kitchen -- small kitchen, and a hall
, that is all. And this woman, that was in 
her 40™s -- in her 50™s, Mies, Mi
es was her name. And she had 27 Jews in that apartment. 
 

Q: This is on Re inkenstraat -- 

 

A: On the Reinkenstraat 19. 

 

Q: Yes?  Ri -- rik -- Reinkenstraat. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
47 
 
 
 
A: Oh, and I couldn™t believe it. And I sai
d, ﬁYou will be  arreste
d.ﬂ I said, ﬁDo you know 
your neighbors, are they Nazis?
ﬂ She said, ﬁI don™t know.ﬂ And 
then when I talked to her, 
I saw she had a warm he art, she had to help, 
but she did not use her gray ma tter. And she 
didn™t see the danger, and sh
e -- her father was a Dutch guy, and her mother was from 
Indonesia. And I don™t know if you spoke w
ith the people that -- Indonesians speak 
staccato, and she™s, ﬁI feel so sorry for thos
e people, and on Saturday night I put records 
on, and then they ma y dance.ﬂ Oh dear lor
d, I said, ﬁAnd you lived here all those years 
alone? ﬂ  ﬁYeah.ﬂ ﬁHow long? ﬂ ﬁEight years.
ﬂ I said, ﬁDid you dance when you were 
alone on Saturday night?ﬂ Because I could hear in the apartment next door, it was not 

insulated very well, and at one 
I heard that they flushed the 
toilet, so I heard the water go 
through the pipes, I said, ﬁDo you hear that? ﬂ  Sh
e said, ﬁYeah.ﬂ She didn™t think -- I said, 
ﬁNow, when you lived alone, how many times di
d you flush the toilet, that the neighbors 
can hear it?ﬂ I said, ﬁNow 
you™re 28 people, that thing mu
st be going the whole day.ﬂ I 
said, ﬁYou have to,ﬂ -- and she didn™t 
see at all. And I promi s ed her -- 
 

Q: I -- we have to stop the tape. 

 

A: Oh. 

 

Q: So, we™re going to go -- 

 

A: Mies,oh. 

 

Q: -- right back to this the next tape. 

 
End of Tape #4 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481

Tape #5 
 
Q: Diet, I™m sorry for the interruption. So you™re
 -- you™re at Mies™s apartment, and you™re 
noticing that she™s taking no precautions. 
So the toilet can flus h, God only knows how 
ma ny ti me s during the day. 
 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: She™s playing music, and people are dancing. Now how did -- how -- why were you sent 
to her house? 
 

A: Because Hein asked me , and Hein had me
t the guy who brought all the Jews there. 
 

Q: Oh. 

 

A: His name  was Bram, I think an a -- abbrev
iation for Abraham. And later that -- that guy -- 
but he did not have the help we had, the ka 
-- the ration cards, and he didn™t know what to 
do, he brought them there, but there they were stuck. So Ab promised Mies to find places, 

and I said, ﬁListen, I™ll bring you in the first 
place 27 cards without a 
J, and I™ll bring you 
ration cards, and then I™ll find places, and k
eep two, at the most three, and that™s how 
ma ybe you will see it.ﬂ Because she di
dn™t see the danger. And -- and -- 
 

Q: Was she just naïve, or stupid? 

 

A: Yeah -- she couldn™t say no. She -- 

 
Q: She just couldn™t say no. 
 

A: She couldn™t say no, and she had a golden 
heart, but she did not see the danger.  
 

Q: How did she feed 27 people? 

 

A: Well, that wa s -- that we brought the cards, 
and this Bram brought there bags of potatoes, 
and brought stuff what he c
ould get on the black ma rket. 
 

Q: But -- but the ration cards for th
e food, she can™t go out with 27 cards. 
 

A: No, but she had a ma id, a young girl from 
Strafenhaagen -- Strafenhaagen, that™s a 
difficult word. 
 

Q: Yes. 

 

A: And before that was her cleaning lady, but 
now her whole thing was 
that four cards she 
could take, and buy there, and she was in 
on it, and four there,
 and five there. 
 

Q: Isee. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
49 
 
 
 
A: So that girl was daily
 doing the shopping, and -- 
 

Q: And going to different pl aces, I see. 

 

A: -- I think that the Jewish people cleaned a 
bit. But this girl was only sent out to do 
shopping in all di fferent places, for 
four, five or six, or some thing. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: And that was her -- and she only worked th
ere till one o™clock, and I alwa ys came after 
five, and her name  was Jaantje. And I have ne
ver me t Jaantje, and I heard so much about 
her, and Jaantje heard so much about me . A
nd now for the German fer -- film, we met. 
 

Q: For the fi rst time? 
 
A: Imagi -- yeah [indecipherable] was funny. 

 

Q: Huh. So, did you find places for these people? 

 

A: Yeah, I found -- that was that guy that lost
 hi s Tallit, and loads 
of them, and I brought 
them away, and I had her down to seven, and 
I started a big sigh, I thought, now we get 
some where. 
 

Q: Right. 

 
A: And I got back the next time , and she ha
d eight new ones, 15. And a few weeks later she 
had again in the 20™s. And I thought, this is desp
erate, and I said to her, ﬁMies, I™m scared 
to come here, because if there,ﬂ -- I said, 
ﬁyou will be arrested, there™s no doubt in my  
mi nd.ﬂ I said, ﬁAnd you know,ﬂ -- when you were 
arrested, what the Gestapo did is they 
didn™t just take you away. They 
let you sit there, a
nd of course you were part of a group, 
and with a revolver near your head, if the phone
 rang you had to take it, and just pretend 
that there wa s nothing, and the 
next one would come , and th
e next one. So I knew about 
it. I said, ﬁListen, I™ll give you one word, 
potato,ﬂ or some thing, or sugar, some thing 
easy, I said, ﬁand I call you a few mi nutes before
 I come here, every time. I™m scared.ﬂ I 
said, ﬁOne day the Gestapo sits here, and I wa
lk in their open arms.ﬂ
 I said, ﬁAnd I won™t 
-- that if you answer me  that you use this word,ﬂ -- I can™t reme mber what I gave her, but 
some thing very simple. I says, ﬁAnd if you 
don™t say that word, I™m not comi ng. That 
means for me the Gestapo is here.ﬂ  But I wasn
™t there, but Bram was there, and Bram was 
that guy who had brought all the Jews there,
 and he was just bringing a big bag with 
potatoes and food, and he had asked Hein, he sai
d, ﬁI know that Diet do
esn™t want to give 
her name  to,ﬂ -- Mies didn™t know anything. I 
said, ﬁMies, I don™t tell you what,ﬂ -- she 
wanted to know who I was, said call me  T
oos. Where do you live?  I said, ﬁI™m not telling 
you.ﬂ I said but -- she said, ﬁB
ut if I need you, what can -- 
how can,ﬂ -- I sa
id, ﬁI™ll call 
you the mo me nt I get up in the morning. I™ll call you an hour before my lunch break, and 

I could come  here on my bike in my lunch 
break,ﬂ I said. ﬁAnd I™ll 
call you two or three 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481

hours before curfew, and if you need me , I™ll be here.ﬂ I was there for weeks on end, I 
don™t know, months ma ybe, four or five times a 
week. The old Jew of -- in her eight -- in 
-- in his 80™s, died. Can you imagine, how 
you have to bury that 
guy, I think it™s in the 
book. But I tol -- Hein wa s fortunately in The Hague, because he was often not there. He 

said, ﬁOh, I™ll take care of it.ﬂ So they
 wrapped him in a rug, and everybody was 
changing, your beautiful crystal -- what do you do
 with crystal, you need to eat, so they 
went to the fa rmers and exchanged it for gr
ain, or whatever, and so when Hein and his 
friend carried that rug out, th
e neighbors must have thought, 
oh he™s exchan -- getting a 
rug for potatoes, or so. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: And they had a hand car, and they pushed 
it. And I didn™t want to
 know anything that I 
didn™t ha ve to know, because I was so afraid th
at one day I would be arrested, that they 
will do -- one of their tortures was pulling you
r nails one by one, and then your feet, and 
anything, I thought I -- only what I have 
to know, I don™t want to know anything else. 
And I said to Hein -- Hein said we should bur
y him in a big [indecipherable] close to the 
[indecipherable]. That man was good and he ha
d a big -- a walled garden, and we were -- 
they were allowed to bury him in the back of
 that garden [indeciphe
rable] and after the 
war you can bury him in a Jewish ceme tery, because the Jewish people like that. And I 

never asked him, and I had such a conscien
ce trouble when Hein never came  back, I 
thought, oh, I should have asked him. And wh
en I spoke to that Dutch guy from the 

resistance, he says, ﬁDo you ha
ve questions,ﬂ because he ha
d questions about a traitor, 
and I knew some thing about it. And I said, ﬁY
eah,ﬂ I said, ﬁthat Jewish guy,ﬂ -- and he 

said, ﬁDon™t worry, he was burie
d in the Jewish ceme tery,ﬂ 
so that was good that I know 
that. But then -- then she had so ma ny, and 
one day Bram was there, and they were all 
arrest ed. 
 

Q: They were all arrest ed? 

 

A: They were all arrested, and I ma de my phone
 call, and I had told 
Mies, she had -- she let 
them use the phone, I said, ﬁNo, you shouldn™t.
 You -- you™re living as a lady alone in 
your 50™s, and you answer the phone.ﬂ I said, 
ﬁYou can™t -- you™re t
oo -- too dangerous.ﬂ 
So she had obeyed that, and I dialed and a 
ma n answered, and it wa
s 11, so I thought an 
hour before my lunch time , I thought there 
she goes again. So I hung up, I didn™t say a 
word. And then around two o™clock I phoned, a
nd a ma n ans wered. At three o™clock I 
phoned, a man answered. I thought, this is not 
good. So I took one 
of my coupons, and I 
went to a store across, a food store, and I 
thought, if that has happened, I knew how they 
did it, big trucks with guys with mach
ine guns, and helmets, and the house surrounded, 
and so on. And I thought that will be the topic 
of conversation there. So I took my bread 
coupon, and I went there with money, and sure
 enough they were all talking about that 
there are -- they were all arrest ed, and Bram, 
too. And then Hein a
nd I -- I didn™t dare to 
sleep at home, because I had never given Mies
 where I was, but I did not know that Bram 
had been there, see? I™d never me t Bram. I didn™t know  
 

Q: But he knew you? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
51 
 
 
 
A: He never me t me , but he had my father™s phone number. 

 

Q: Isee. 

 

A: Because Hein had asked, if there is an
 emergency, how can I reach you [indecipherabl e] 

 

Q: Right,right. 

 

A: And Hein had given Bram
 only my phone numbe r -- 

 

Q: Isee. 

 

A: -- but he had never me t, and he didn™
t know where I lived, he only had my  phone 
number. But he was the only one, so it must 
have been him. But anyway, that night I 
thought well, I don™t know where I slipped up 
with Mi-Mies that she still found out 
where I was, so I didn™t sleep home, and I 
let Hein know, and he slept somewhere else. 
And this went on for ma ybe 10 days, and not
hing happened, so I moved back home. And 
then co -- 
 

Q: Was that the first time  that you left the house -- 

 

A: That I sl ept -- 

 

Q: Elsewhere. 

 
A: -- I went regularly to the o
ffice, but I didn™t 
sl eep at home. 
 
Q: Uh-huh. 

 

A: And -- because I thought, you know, I can™t ta
ke the risk. And when weeks later, Hein 
and I had decided we would get ma rried, a
nd we took out our wedding license, and then 
you have to go again to the town hall, so
 on my c a rd was written took out a wedding 
license with Hein Sietsma, on his card, Diet
 Ema n. And also, it was very strange, that 
was May ™43, May fourth, and I had a real f
eeling -- our love had grown so much, but 
some thing in my heart said, ﬁAnd you™ll neve
r ma rry hi m.ﬂ Strange, huh?  Very strange. 
And I thought -- I can™t see that 
we ever would break off, but 
-- and I didn™t dare to tell 
him. And then, a few we eks later, we had ju
st taken out our we dding 
license, and that -- 
the town hall in The Hague was a big, very [indecipherable] with ma rble steps, and I 

think that by that time, I had told hi m. I sa
id, ﬁWell, it must be true, but,ﬂ I said, ﬁI 

always had the feeling we  would never get 
ma rried.ﬂ And [indecipherable] there is only 
one thing, either you die, or I die. He said, 
ﬁDo you have that fee
ling?ﬂ I said, ﬁNo.ﬂ I 
didn™t dare to say -- I didn™t know what
, but it was some where -- subconscious. And 

when we wa lked down those ma rble step, and 
he had bought me  a big 
bunch of red roses, 
and I had them in this arm, and he had my arm,
 a nd in his left hand he had the papers that 
we will get married in September, because 
then you got coupons for [indecipherable] and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
52 
 
 
for some  [indecipherable]. And I re member that
 he take my [i ndecipherable] and he said, 
ﬁDon™t you still now believe it? ﬂ And I said, ﬁN
ow I believe it.ﬂ And inside a voice wa s 
screaming no, no [indecipherable] it was so 
strange, it -- it™s scary. Anyway -- 
 
Q: Was this before or after the bicy
cle trip where you 
heard this voice? 
 

A: It was before. 

 

Q: It was before the bicycle trip. So this happened -- 

 

A: In™43. 

 

Q: Uh-huh. 

 

A: It started slowly to
 -- inside. Strange, huh? 
 

Q: That -- that it woul
dn™t -- it wouldn™t happen.  
 

A: I -- I -- I™m really scared 
when I have those feelings. So
me  time  ago, I had a terrible 
feeling -- that same  feeling, so had me like 
a stone, and it concerned my kids. And then -- 
my daughter doesn™t ever want to upset me , 
and a week later I found out that she had to 
have a biopsy, she had done a pap test, a
nd it was not good, and she had to biopsy. And 
that was -- that I -- it turned out that th
ey don™t really know, so she has to have another 
test, and these doctors [indecipherable] she goes 
to another one. But it™s very strange, and 
you know fr om the book that the night that Hein died -- 
 
Q: Right. 
 

A: It™shorrible. 

 

Q: It™s horrible. [indecipherable] 

 

A: And only with big things in my life, I have that. 

 

Q: Notsmall? 

 

A: No, not little things. 

 

Q: And then on a bicycle trip you hear
d a voice, and what did the voice say? 
 

A: Twice. The voice said, Kijk nog ma r goed naar
 hem. Have a -- have a good look at him. 
Strange, huh? 
 

Q: Verystrange. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
53 
 
 
A: It™s scary. It™s scary. On the other ha
nd, I think that God ma y be preparing me  
[indecipherable]  
 
Q: It was what? 

 

A: That God maybe prepares me  for some thing that™s comi ng, I don™t know. But anyway, 
then we went home, and then a few weeks later,
 that™s when Mies was arrested, and that I 
didn™t sleep home . But then, after that, when th
ey -- my father wrote 
of my brother -- he 
had false papers that he was in the food 
supply. He opened the door, and there were two 

Gestapo guys, but he didn™t know it. First 
they pretended that they needed me  for 

some body who needed to go in hiding, but my 
brother di dn™t fall for that, because they 
didn™t come  to your door and ask for a place. 
So then -- and one didn™t even speak good 
Dutch, he was German. And then, in the end 
they said, ﬁWell, where does she work, we 
need to speak to her, and it™s very urgent.ﬂ And he had to [indecipherable] where I 

worked. So the mo ment they had left, they called me  and they said that two guys, they 

can™t speak good Dutch, and they were needing 
to speak to me , and it must be Gestapo. 
So I picked up my purse, and you know, I alwa
ys think before you ask your boss, ma y I 
go to the dentist, I™ll be back
 in an hour. And I worked fo
r the father of my pi -- young 
girlfriend, who -- when we were young, and I knoc
ked at his door, and I 
said, ﬁI have to 
leave, and I™ll see you 
after the war.ﬂ So I picked up, a
nd I never went home  again. And 
that was May, ™43. So for two years, till the 
end of the war, because the Gestapo came all 
the time  to my parent™s house, I couldn™t go home  any more.  
 

Q: So then what do you do? You leave your
 -- you -- you leave your office, where do you 
go? 
 
A: I went straight to Hein™s office, because 
then they knew about him, too, we had taken out 
a wedding license. So then he went, and he -- 
 
Q: He™s working at Shell, still? 

 

A: He was working at Shell. And he went to 
Ab, the other leader, and I went first to some  
friends, and then later -- my si
ster had just had a baby, she 
was married, and they never -- 
they were so busy, so she says to -- I -- I 
went there on my bike, and she says, ﬁOh, can™t 

you stay here four or five days, and take 
care of the kids? ﬂ  The 
young kids. And then my 
husband and I can go out and have some  ti me  
for ourselves. So I stayed there I think a 

week. And then the guy where we always had 
the meetings, the patriot from our country -
- from our office. I was in The Hague with 
another address and I saw him, and his wife 
said, ﬁMy sister in Eindhoven needs a ma i
d, and she™s very difficult, and she goes 
through ma ids like nothing. I can ask her if you ca
n be there.ﬂ And I™d never been in that 
setting, so I thought, hey that™s totally no conn
ection. They might still connect my sister. 
So anyway, then she said oh yeah, she needed a ma id. And s he had three kids, and the 

youngest had a -- I™ve forgotten the name , here, 
or tosis or some thing. He  had that he had 
to measure od -- my friend [indecipherable] fr
om t he office had a son who was me ntally 

retarded. And they found out as 
a little kid he should have ha
d loads and loads of fat, and 
butter. But it was a d -- a disease that  they ha
d just discovered, and th
e kid of this sister 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
54 
 
 
had that same disease. So every day on how 
you weigh the mail, the -- the envelopes, so 
much grams  of grease and fat and butter he had to eat. And very litt
le other things, so 
much bread. But it was all measured. So she had her hands full, and she was -- she had a 
good sense of humor, but she was a difficult wo
ma n, and that™s why she went through so 
ma ny maid. But that little boy™s name was R
udy, and he was three years old, and he was 
a sweetheart. And I had to take care of 
hi m, and it was terrible because it was so 
important that he got all that 
fat, and he never got me ntally 
retarded if he had -- if he 
vomited, I had to scoop it up and feed it again 
to him. And his mother
 couldn™t get it in, 
but I did all crazy things with 
him, and then he started laughi
ng, and he ate it. So -- but I 
was there a long time, and she was very di
fficult. And I was not a ma id, you know, I had 
never -- when I left my home I didn™t ev
en know how to boil a potato. So the -- 
 

Q: So were you -- were you required to cook, as well? 

 

A: Well, she did the cooking, but I had to clean
 and do the whole thing, 
so -- but I learned 
there a lot, and later on the fa
rms I learned so mu ch, oh -- 
 

Q: But just [indecipherable] 

 

A: I star ted out there -- 

 

Q: You didn™t have your real name  then? 

 

A: No, then I was Dineke de Jong, that was 
-- but I didn™t go because I knew one fa mily 
there whose son was also in the 
resistance, but I di dn™t -- for th
em, that they were in risk 
that they had some body in hiding, so I never 
went to that church or anything. But I 
reme mber it was a very close by, it was on the [indecipherable] in Eindhoven, and there 

was -- at the other end of that pl ane is a 
plaza, and a park with trees, and there was a 
Catholic church. And some ti me s I was so deep
 down in the dumps that I just -- and the 

Catholic church are always open. Oh [ind
ecipherable]. But anyway, I was there a long 

time, and -- 
 

Q: Were you also working as -- in the re
sistance, or were you 
just being a maid? 

 

A: No, this was just --  I was there 
several months. No, I was just a ma id. 
 

Q: But here you -- you don™t know anyone. 

 

A: No, I was totally alone. 

 

Q: Right. You can™t communicate with your pa
rents. Are you able to communicate with 
Hein or not? 
 

A: Hein and I -- 

 

Q: Hein. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
55 
 
 
 
A: -- wrote each other on false name s. 

 

Q: Youdid? 

 

A: Yeah. So I got mail from him. And I also 
send him ma il that he gave to other guys from 
our group, and some  of them were in The Hague
, and not being looked for, so my parents 
got always, every 10 or 12 days, a note in my 
handwriting, that they kn
ew I was alive, but 
I did not let them know where I was. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: It was much better. And I did also not wr
ite neither father and mother, of course you 
didn™t. 
 

Q: Yes,right. 

 

A: Just -- but they saw in my -- and one of 
the guys always dropped that off [indecipherable] 
 

Q: And none of this is done th
rough the regular mail system -- 
 

A: No. 

 

Q: -- you™re doing this always through -- 

 

A: [indecipherable] handling, yeah.  
 
Q: Yeah. 

 

A: But the letters to Hein I sent
 to an address and ma iled by --  
 

Q: Regularpost? 

 

A: -- you know, my friends, where I knew that he 
was often in that area.
 And he send me  at 
this addr ess, because I was there, the maid under the name Dineke de Jong.  
 

Q: But -- but he -- neither -- you™re not sendi
ng anything through the regular post, either? 
 

A: The dangerous stuff, never. 

 

Q: But the norma l letter you could send? 

 

A: Well, we did at this time, you know. 

 

Q: Uh-huh. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
56 
 
 
A: But we did not do it at -- if
 I was at an address where ther
e are Jews hidden, I wouldn™t 
do it. 
 
Q: Right. 

 

A: But here there was no really danger, he was 
very high in the council,
 city council, he was 
right under the ma yor. He was a very 
nice ma n. And I loved the Rudy, and -- 
 

Q: Rudy? 

 

A: It was Eindhoven, yeah, and that was so of
ten bombarded because th
at™s where Phillips 
is, you know, and that was 
the war industry then -- 
 

Q: Uh-huh,right. 

 

A: -- so and I had my order, I slept on the sa
me  floor as Rudy, so if Rudy -- if there was a 
bombardme nt, we all had to go down, then 
I took care of Rudy, and they had the two 
other kids. But then one time I got a letter fr
om Hein, and it said, ﬁD
iet, we haven™t seen 
each other in such a long time, let™s go to Amsterdam, to friends of ours, and let™s meet.ﬂ 

And it was a city just outside Duga, so he 
would come from Friesland, I would -- and the 
trai n would be four or fi ve mi nutes that we
 will change trains and go to Amsterdam.  And 
it was a s -- it was -- I had to meet hi
m on Saturday, and on Sunday we would be 
together. And that lady, I was really the ma id
 to her, and she says, ﬁYou can™t go, because 
Sunday after church I™ve invi
ted this lady, and you have to serve coffee.ﬂ So I couldn™t go 
for serving coffee, that stupid hour that I co
uldn™t see Hein. So I said, ﬁHe won™t take 
that,ﬂ because I know -- I knew him, I says, 
ﬁHe will be furious.ﬂ 
ﬁOh, how childish.ﬂ I 
said, ﬁNo, he  counts on me , and there™s no ti
me to reach hi m. ﬂ I couldn™t reach hi m 
anyway, he™s traveling. She said, ﬁWell, then
 you can go to the city,ﬂ it was called 
Sonnhooven, ﬁand you can tell him that you can™t
 come  in, you have to come  back.ﬂ 
[indecipherable]. And I was so grateful that
 those people were hiding me  while I was 
being searched for, because my parent
s had all the time the Gestapo over the 
[indecipherable], so it wa s dangerous, but I was so
 grateful that I felt I had to do what she 
said. So I take the train -- I never forget
 it, I came in Sonnhooven, and Hein came out of 
his train, and there was the train to Amsterdam,
 and he had three or four mi nutes, and he 
grabs my ha nd, he says dos -- I said, ﬁNo I 
can™t go.ﬂ He said, ﬁC
ome on, you can tell me 
later.ﬂ I said, ﬁNo, I can™t go.ﬂ
 And I pulled back, and oh, he was furious, furious. And he 
said, ﬁFor that stupid coffee,
ﬂ he said, ﬁyou™re going away
 there,ﬂ he said, ﬁI™ll find 
another address, you™re going away.ﬂ And I fe
lt so bad because after all, they had taken 

me  when I was in big trouble, and I had gotte
n to love Rudy, and then Hein says to me , 
ﬁDiet, we need you really full time, it™s getti
ng more and more busy.ﬂ So I went back to 
Eindhoven, and she said, ﬁAnd what? ﬂ  I said, ﬁWe
ll, like I told you, he was furious, and I 
have to leave here.ﬂ ﬁWhat? ﬂ 
And they couldn™t believe it, a
nd then they were trying to -- 
I said, ﬁNo, they say that they need me .ﬂ 
And that was very hard, and I left, and I™ve 
never seen Rudy again, none 
of them. And that -- 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
57 
 
 
Q: What was their name, what was the family name ? 
 
A: Wait a mo ment, what was it again?  [inaudible] 
 

Q: Was it Bakker, Backer? 

 

A: Baker, yeah, Baker. 

 

Q: B-a-k-k-e-r? 

 

A: Yeah, yeah, Bakker, Bakker.  

 

Q: So you never saw any of them again? 

 

A: No. 

 

Q: And you we re there for a few months, you think? 

 

A: I was there I think a month, two or three months. 

 

Q: So in the summertime? 

 

A: I was in -- made attempt to find me , a nd th
en I was first of all [i
ndecipherable] and I was 
at my sister. I think I went ther
e in June or July, at that ti
me . And I left in the beginning 
of Dece mbe r , so I was there several months. 
And it™s almost nice because they -- it was 
in an outsi de area, and there were appl e 
trees, and there was nothing any more, so 
some ti me s I had a job that I had to on my bi
ke go to an apple thing and buy apples. It was 
nice, and beautiful country, and outside on your
 bike and alone, th
at you could think, and 
-- but then I went for a time  in the underground, 
and there was a fa mily with five kids -- 
seven kids, and that guy was al
so deep in the underground. 
 

Q: And this was Klooster? 

 

A: That was Klooster. 

 

Q: Dries? 

 

A: DriesKlooster. 

 

Q: It™sKlooster? 

 

A: Klooster. 

 

Q: Klooster. 

 

A: K-l-o-o-s-t-e-r,Dries. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
58 
 
 
 
Q: Right. 

 

A: And he worked in the post office, and 
he was a great guy, but h -- the youngest was two, 
then they had one of five, seven, nine and then
 two kids from her first marriage that were 
my age, and a bit younger. So there we re a lo
t of kids, and then I 
could, during the day do 
my underground work, but I slept there. 
 

Q: And they knew that you were working for the underground -- 

 

A: They knew, because he was also -- 

 

Q: Yes,yes. 

 

A: He was also -- and they took pilots in, a
nd shot down allies. And that was the most 
dangerous because you know, for arme d robbery 
you got still prison and a trial, but you 
were shot. But if they were found -- if they found you with allies, you -- 
 

Q: You were -- 

 

A: On the spot, you were killed 

 

Q: On the spot, uh-huh. 

 

A: I know from several cases that it happened. Sometimes they still arrested you, but they 
had a right to shoot you at the 
spot. But we had pilots, and 
it was a terrible danger, and 
there was your word, but now everybody knows that we had never heard it okay, okay. 

And those pilots, three or four from a shot 
down plane, they were talking to each other, 
and okay, and I knew English, so I could speak wi
th them, but those kids we nt outside in 
the street at five, seven and nine, and they
 said okay, okay, okay. That was a give-away 
that there we re allies, so I 
thought, I can™t stay here, and 
I told them. And t hen Hein 
found another place on this farm, with co 
-- with Lozeman. And that was where the 
Jewish couple, the falsifier was hiding. So 
that became really my base, but wherever I 
was, I had friends by that time I could use everywhere, but that was -- became  my base.  
 

Q: Lozeman, which is L- o-z-e-m- a-n? 

 

A: Lozeman,L-o-z-e-m- a-n. 

 

Q: Uh-huh. 

 

A: And his name was Aalt, A-a-l-t. 

 

Q: Right. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
59 
 
 
A: And her name  was Alie, A-l-i-e. And they 
became  like a brother and sister to me . Oh, 
they were wonderful people. And that™s wh
ere the Jewish couple was hiding, and they 
had always -- whoever passed by and was 
in the underground could sleep there. 
 
Q: And this was Uncle Ben and Tante Marie? 

 

A: And Tante Marie, yeah, they were there. 

 

Q: Uh-huh. 

 

A: And he was a dairy farmer, and they work
 hard. And it was, for a city girl, very 
interesting, too. And Alie sa
id, ﬁYou are for the world my maid,ﬂ because she was 

pregnant again, and she had tw
o little kids. So I se -- but 
I could go for my work, but I 
said, ﬁYou tell me , I can arrange it myself, wh
ich date you really need me .ﬂ And you got 
so little soap, so every three weeks you did 
a laundry, and at that time the people changed 

only once a week their underwear
. Their socks were [indeciph
erable], you could put them 
on the floor, and they would stand. But th
ere was -- you got -- a
nd the soap was like 
putty, brown and stone hard, so you first had to 
grate it. And there was 
so little that it was 
better to do the [indecipherable] three weeks.
 So then I always was there on Monday. 
And then the farmer woke me  up at quarter  to five. And they had a well and a pump on 

that deel. The deel is the connection to the fa
rm where in winter all the stables are and the 
cows are, and the horse has a stable. But it™
s connected to the far m, and that was also 
where the bathroom was, you know. What the co
ws dropped, that went in a pit, and what 
we dropped, it™s [indecipherable] 
 

Q: Sa me thing. 
 
A: And -- and there was the water pump. So then
 I reme mber that I had to pump two pails, 
and then I had a yoke on, and I had to carry 
that outside, because th
at was ice cold. And 
then the farmer had gotten up a bit earlier, 
and there was a big cement thing with a deep 
hole, and then you had to put the water in it,
 underneath, they had [indecipherable] all the 
little twigs, and that was warm. So then we 
had to warm, and nearly
 boil that water, and 
then get it back, and then I had to carry it b
ack to the deel, and fill it in bi g wooden tubs, 
and then stamp 200 time s . And then it had to 
go in the rinse, and then in the Chlorox, 
later you do it [indecipherable]. And then in th
e [indecipherable] it™s 
blue, that the white 
stuff was nice and -- and then rinse again. And 
afterward you did all the white stuff, then 
the colored stuff, and at last the dark stu
ff. And by that time it was mud. But I learned 
how to do a laundry there.  
 

Q: And I can see -- 

 

A: And in Mar -- March and Apr
il, then I had to spread all 
the white stuff on the meadows, 
because then there was ozone in the sky, and it ma ked it even whiter. And you had to get 

-- keep it wet, so I started in those months, I 
started always quarter to five, and then when 

they had breakfast at 7:30, 
they called me  for breakfast, and they called me at 10, or 
quarter after for a cup of coffee, and they ca
lled me for lunch. And then in the evening I

was ma ybe -- especially in the months that I 
had to keep that stuff white, ma ybe at 5:30. 
It was all by hand, you know.  
 
Q: Wow 

 

A: So I learned it, and that saved my life  later 
in the camp, that I -- all my false paper was in 
there, and that they let me  do the laundry.  
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: If that happened right after 
that they came [indecipherabl e]  
 

Q: Right. We ™re gonna stop the 
tape now, and take a break. 
 

A: Good. That i --

Tape #6 
 
Q: Okay Diet, I wanted to stop the flow of the interview for a mo me nt because you brought 
some  artifacts. Can you hold this and explain wh
at this is and show
 us what this is? 
 

A: Now, there was curfew, and every city 
in the Netherlands was what they called 
verduisderd, everywhere curtains. And every st
reet had a su -- superv
isor who lived there, 
and by the Germans he was told, every nigh
t you have to walk around -- they were 
allowed even after curfew, to see if any li
ght would shine out. So everybody had dark 
curtains. But if you had to go some where in winter, and on nights that was no moon or 

snow, you would bump i n people, you didn™
t see them, you didn™t hear them. So 
everybody had this, and it was a dynamo, and that
 they called it knijpka
t. Your -- ca -- 
this is knijp, you press. And then you saw everyw
here a little -- this was very little, so 
then you had light where you stepped, if you wo
uld step in a hole, you could break your 
ankle. But it was funny when you walked, or 
funny -- it was not so
 funny, but your -- you 
didn™t see people, but you heard everywhere 
in the dark the -- th
is noise, and then you 
know it. So I always kept it, it was kind of funny. 
 

Q: So almost everyone -- 

 

A: Everybody had -- 

 

Q: -- in the nether -- had on
e, because you couldn™t go -- 
 

A: -- one, yeah, because if you went out -- in wint er
 it was dark at five, so even at seven or 
eight if you went out. 11 
o™clo -- 11 was curfew.  
 

Q: Right,right. 

 

A: But you had to have this, because that was the only way -- you know, and now the streets 
are so even, but then you 
could easily fall, and there 
were holes, and nothing was 
repaired, so you could easily break an a
nkle, or fall terri
bly. [indecipherable] 
 

Q: How does that work? 

 

A: What? 

 

Q: How does that work?  Is it -- 

 

A: Well, it is a dynamo, bec a use the bikes had th
at, too. They had that on their front thing, 
and the line -- so you produce your own, it 
-- it™s a dynamo, I don™t know. Dyna mo you 
say, I think. 
 

Q: Dyna mo. It™s fabulous. 

 

A: Yeah. But the bulb mi ght be gone
, or that there™s still some  -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
62 
 
 
 
Q: No, it come s out just a tiny bit. 

 

A: Some  light come s out?   

 

Q: If you do it -- if you do it
 hard enough, you can see it. 
 

A: Well, the bulb mi ght be out.  

 

Q: And then there™s some thing else that 
you stole. Explain -- ex
plain [indecipherable] 
 

A: And I feel good about it. 

 

Q: Yeah,absolutely. 

 

A: They entered, in the beginning of the war, our
 houses. They just -- the doorbell ring, they 
pushed you to the side, marched i
n, took everything of copper, brass, me tal, and they just 
melt it for their bullets. So in our house [i
ndecipherable] we were warned, so we had 

everything -- we had beautiful 
brass stuff from Indonesia, en
graved, so you put it -- there 
was no plastic yet, that you put it in now. No
w, rubber sheeting, what 
the hospitals had to 
cover the bed, and that went all in the garden
s under the ground. So there it was, so they 
didn™t catch much. But I was in the train, and 
I wa s seeing this were the ashtrays that 
were welded in the trains, here you see that. 
So I figured that are 
about six bullets, and 
they™ll probably one of these days take that 
off, so I thought I™ll be ahead of you. I had to 
ma ke a very long train trip, and they cram
me d us in a few wagons, and then they had 

loads of wagons where one German soldier was sitting and a bi g sign, forbidden for 
others, only for the German ar my. But when 
I was standing there so long, and I got more 
and more mad. So I was standing pushed ag
ainst one of those, and I don™t know how I 
did that, probably my fury, but
 in the end I pulled it off. 
 
Q: So you pulled this off? 

 

A: I pulled it off, I wrung it off, 
I don™t -- so I saved six bullets.  
 

Q: And where did you keep this, so that you c
ould get it after the war?  Do you reme mb  -- 
you -- do you -- 
 

A: No. I mean, this was -- they wouldn™t sear
ch your house for this, even if they had come 
and they found [indecipherable] 
 

Q: So do you think you brought it back to your parents house? 

 

A: If it happened when I was still home,
 yes, and otherwise where I was hiding. 
 

Q: Otherwise it was some pl ace else. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
63 
 
 
A: But this was not dangerous stuff, if you ha
d stolen documents or so
me, but this -- I think 
that they never have put two and two togeth
er, that some body in their fury had bothered 
six bullets. 
 
Q: But you mus t  have felt good just to do that, yeah? 

 

A: Oh, very good. 

 

Q: Very good. Do you know other people who we
re doing similar kinds of things?  These 
little -- 
 

A: No, I know that if a Gestapo guy, or a Ge
rman soldier came, you watched in the s -- 
walked in the street, and he was comi ng that, 
then you crossed the street, like that they 
were poison or some thing. And I know people 
who spit on this -- on the thing. They -- 
 

Q: Spit on the ground? 

 

A: When they saw a Germa n soldier. And I know
 that one time  a soldier came  and asked me 
to go to Scheveningen, and there was a big batt
alion, and I knew it was 
there, but I didn™t 
want to help them, so I said, oh yeah, ther
e, and I sent him 90 to 180 degrees the other 
way. [indecipherable]. Anything that you could 
do against them, we did. Terrible, hey? 
 

Q: No, it™s great. It™s a great story. Now, thi
ngs start to get very 
rough, personally, in 1944. 
You™re in a bike trip with Hein with -- wh en you hear this voice, 
after you™ve had this 
premonition that™s he™s going to be arrested. 
And it™s o- only a few days later, after the 
bike trip, that he does get -- 
 

Q: It was April 23, ™44. And they were a whol
e year looking for us. And Hein wrote me  a 
letter, and he said, be Saturday
 night at that and that farm, 
and I then I think I told you 
this morning that went to church together, 
and then we had dinner 
at that leader -- the 
other leader, there were two, and he was a farme r , so they got up in the morning and they 

wanted to take a nap. And then Hein sai
d, We  -- we going on a bike ride, and it was 
beautiful spring weather, and 
all the fr uit trees had their 
pink blossoms. And we were 
alone on that, and Hein pulled his Bible out, a
nd he read from John 14, 
and that is in my 
Father™s house, I have ma ny ma nsions, and I don™t know, I still reme mber that. And then 

he told me everythi ng about the work, becau
se I knew only my little pa rt, and I didn™t 
want to know more, because I thought, if you 
are arrested, and they start torturing you, 
you can™t say I™ll keep my mouth shut, you can™t 
say that. And I -- but he said -- I said, 
ﬁHein, don™t tell me , I don™t want to know wh
at the others do.ﬂ He said, ﬁSomebody has 
to know the whole thing,ﬂ he sai
d, ﬁfor in case that Ab or I,
ﬂ -- and I listened to him, and 
then he brought me  that evening to the farm of  
Alie, and we were alone on that country road, 
and there was nothing, only those beautiful trees 
that are in the distance. And I 
heard clearly a voice, and I s 
-- can™t explain it. And that 
voice said in Dutch to me, Kijk nog ma r goed n
aar hem. That™s in English, have a good 
look at him. And I thought this is ridiculous, 
that is a thought that 
come s in my head, but 
I heard it again, twice. 
And then I started looking at him, 
and he was far over six feet, so I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
64 
 
 
[indecipherable] and I looked up, and he star
ted laughing. He  said, ﬁWhat are you staring 
at me ? ﬂ  And I didn™t dare to tell him,  and 
I said, ﬁNothing.ﬂ And he brought me  to the 
far m, and that was the last time I saw him. A
nd three days later he was in Friesland, and 
he was inspected in the train like ma ny peopl
e, but me n especially. And they saw that he 
was a pastor, so he was safe. But then they searched him, and they found a lot of stuff 
what he had there. So he was put in 
a prison. But we felt -- and I -- you saw those 
coupons, and those I.D.s, those identification car
ds. And when we stole them, if that was 
found in a large quantity, you got shot. I mean, th
at was the end of your life. So we fel t , 
all the farme r s, and the people who gave us a 
bed, were already ru-r
unning a risk. It could 
be that three in the night ther
e™s the doorbell, and they look 
for us. So we always had to 
find a way out, in the back door or thr
ough a window, but you know where we would go. 
But we did not want to bring all this danger stuff in those home s, because it coul d be that 

I could get out, but that the papers stayed th
ere, and that the pe ople 
would be shot. So we 
had rented a P.O. box some where, and Hein 
smuggled a note out, because we wrote each 
other, and then we gave the letters to others
, and keep them till after the war. But the last 
letter we always kept, it was ki
nd of, you know, close to our heart. 
 

Q: You mean, you -- you -- you kept the la
st one before you got the next one? 
 

A: Yeah, before the next. And so he had my fath
 -- last letter, with my false name . And they 
found that, and they started looking for me . 
 

Q: And which false name  was that? 

 

A: That was Dineke de Jong. 

 
Q: Uh-huh. 
 

A: And they were looking for me , so he  sm
uggled a note out, and it reached us, also by a 
mi racle of God, because that was so much wo
rk, he couldn™t send it straight, and he had 
to trust a guard, it was a Dutch guy. A
nd the underground hated the Dutch people, 
especially the police who stay
ed and worked for the Germans. And sometimes by the -- 
by the Communists they were killed. Those a
dulterators, they help
ed the Germans. But 
this guy had stayed to help. And for some  reas
on or another, that He
in smuggled that note 
out via this guy, and i -- it came via, via, 
via, through lots of 
searching, and underground 
did that -- ma n delivered it 
to the underground, and they f
ound Ab, the other leader. And 
then it said, ﬁEmpty the P.O. box, and don™t us
e it any more,ﬂ because he had a key, and 
he would be afraid that  he will be tortured, 
and if the other ke pt  on sending, that would be 
heavy for him, with his hearing. And he sai
d, ﬁAnd let Diet take another name , they know 
now her false name .ﬂ So then they were looking twice for me , my real name , and this 

name . So it was getting -- the net was getting 
closer. And then he said, And let her warn 
all the guys, and then bring the documents fr
om t he -- from the thing to The Hague, and 
he me ntioned a nickname  that we called this guy. And so I knew what he meant. So I got 

my other pe -- identification 
card again, and then the ma n 
asked me what name do you 

want to have now, because he had made so ma ny. So I says, ﬁWell, the name  of our 

queen, Wilhemina,ﬂ and then I just heard th
e name Laar man -- Laarman. And then he 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
65 
 
 
said, ﬁWhere do you want to be born? ﬂ  And th
ere was no time to put one in that town hall 
anywhere, and then you had to smudge it. I sa
ys well, ma ke it Surinam, Parami bo is the 
capital, and that™s Dutch territory, and they can
™t check that, there was no ma il there, they 
were free. So -- and then he said, ﬁWha
t job?ﬂ And that was a problem, because I 
couldn™t say secretary, because if they 
said where do you work, there was no Willie 
Laarma n, I couldn™t say nurse, I couldn™t say t
eacher. So I said ma id. And there was an 
elderly couple in there, had said, ﬁWe would 
love to help, but we don™t know how, we are 
so old.ﬂ So I went to them, I said, ﬁNow 
you can help. If I am arrested, you vouch that I 
am your ma i d.ﬂ And they said okay. So I wa
s the ma id Willie Laarma n. And then I had 
all that st uff fr om the -- fr om the thing on my
 -- in an envelope in my blouse, and I had 
warned all the guys, and I had lunch with one 
of them, in Zwi j ndrecht,
 and then I had to 
go to The Hague, and that was a short trip, on
ly one stop in Rotterdam, and they -- this 
was in May ™44, they had -- were a whole y
ear looking for me  already, and the Gestapo 
still comi ng to our house, so they had never given up. And then it turned out -- and that 
was so terrible, because normally if they t
hought you help Jews they came four or five 

times, and then they thought -- there were 
so ma ny, then they gave up, but they never 
gave up. And we had a spy in the headquarters of the Gestapo that was -- and he worked 

for us, and he looked in our files, and he f
ound out that Mies had ke
pt a diary, and they 
had found that diary, and in it said Toos br
ought 27 ration cards. Toos brought 27 I.D.s. 
Toos -- and Hein had been there also, but not 
so often because  he wa
s in other parts. And 
he had given the name  Dick. Dick did this, 
Dick -- so they were looking for Toos and 
Dick that they knew were doing the robberies, 
or part of the robberi
es. And that Jewish 
deal wasn™t even important for them, they want
ed that, that™s why they never gave up for 

two years. So we knew that they knew ever
ything about us. But they didn™t know who 

Toos was. And then I found out that that Br
am had been there, and Bram had been, not 
too long before that ma rried, and his bride wa
s crying his ide -- her 
eyes out. And later I 
heard that she paid the Gestapo 5000 guilder
s. And they told him, you go t o Germany, 
and your bride is crying at home. And then, 
I have no proof, but he was the only one who 
knew who the phone number was, so he gave
 the phone number to the Gestapo, and he 
was freed soon after that. But I™ve never seen
 him, and I -- I don™t know, the guy started 
out good, that he wanted to help Jews, so I didn
™t want to ma ke a big fuss out of that. And 
I don™t know if it™s in the book, he™s now -- I hear
d that he died. I checked later out, and I 
didn™t want  to go there, because I thought if
 he knows what that me ntioning of that 
phone, for -- had for results, he would live th
is terrible remor se or some thing, so I™ve 
never ma de any. But he was the 
only one who knew my phone number. 
 

Q: Diet, let me  ask you a question. If the Gesta
po went to your parent™s house, did they say, 
give us pi -- a photograph? 
 

A: No. 

 

Q: They didn™t. They never asked for it. So
 they had no idea what you actually looked like? 
 

A: I don™t think so, unless that 
there was anything in the town hall. But they had no idea, so 
that is a lucky. But I had ch
anged my hairdo, and I did diffe
rent color glasses, you know, 
fra mes, so when they were after me , I always, for the new I.D. -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
66 
 
 
 
Q: Lookeddifferent. 

 

A: I looked a bit different.  

 

Q: Cause that just struck me, 
that if they came to your house -- 
 

A: No, no, I was thinking, now, in this time , 
from DNA, and from ev
ery -- I wouldn™t have a 
chance. 
 

Q: Yeah,yeah. 

 

A: I wouldn™t have a chance, not a chance. 

 

Q: Well, only if they found you, and could check. 

 

A: No, but I think they would much easier find me . 

 

Q: Find you. Maybe so. 

 

A: And with the TV, and with 
all the -- you know, that
 they ask for in this guy, and the 10 
most wanted, and whatever. No, 
I think it™s -- it™s a mi racle. 
 

Q: Right. So, you™re unde
r the name Wi llie. 
 

A: Willie Laarman. And then I said in the trai n 
--  and there was so little fuel, before they 
went every how -- hour, and now they went a 
few times a day. And the train was nearly 
empty, so I knew I would have to wait a l
ong time, so I had a book, and I had a window 
seat, and I start reading. And 
I still reme mber the title of
 the book, Toen De Herten 
Riepen, ﬁWhen the deer called out.ﬂ And anyway -- 
 

Q: When the deer called?  

 

A: When -- yeah, th-that -- in the woods, 
you know. Anyway, I was reading that, and then 
slowly the train fille
d, and after ma ybe an hour and a qua
rter, it start slowly going, and I 
look out of the window, and I felt my heart stop.
 Six gest -- the trains had those steps 
then, you know, and six guys stepped on that
, opened the doors, Gestapo. Four in 
uniform, and two in civil, but they had the 
insignia that  I knew that was German Nazi. 
And then -- several of my group had been ar
rested, and one got out
 by pretending he was 
a black ma rketeer. Then they gave you a 
sentence, but everybody wants to ma ke a buck, 
and that was not so serious resistance, and he
 had gotten out. And he
 had told us, if you 
ever are arrested, don™t show how scared you ar
e, don™t show it, they get their kicks out 
of the [indecipherable]. So how -- don™t -- he ga
ve us that advice. So I thought, I™ll stay 
quiet, stay quiet, and then I thought the hea
dquarters of the Ge stapo is in The Hague, and 
this train is going there, ma ybe they just ha
ve to report, I don™t 
get nervous. And then 
they split out, six wagons, six guys, and th
ey started inspecting 
everybody™s I.D. And I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
67 
 
 
had a real one from the last robbery, but sti
ll, you know, and all this
 stuff here, and they 
were a year long comi ng to my parent™s house.
 I was scared stiff. Oh, I was so scared. 
And -- but I wasn™t allowed to show it. So -- 
but the interesting thi
ng was he started, and 
he takes an I.D., and he looks and gives it b
ack. And it went so fast, and then he came to 
me . And my  heart was pounding. 
 
Q: Yeah, I was wondering, is that -- 

 

A: Oh, it was -- I thought he must hear it. It
 was pounding, and I didn™t 
dare to look at him, 
because you know, I didn™t know if I was blushin
g, or that I was very pale. I -- it was so 
terrible, so I looked like in my book that it 
was very interesting, but
 I couldn™t see a word, 
everything was dancing. And I gave him my 
I.D., and everybody got it back right away, 
and I didn™t got it back. And 
then he said in German to me , ﬁ Wann haben sie das 
bekommen?ﬂ When did you get it?  And I wasn™t
 going to speak German, but I knew what 
he said. I said -- and I said, ﬁI don™t know wh
at you™re saying,ﬂ I sa
id, ﬁI don™t speak der -
- ger -- German, can you speak Dutch?ﬂ And he went on and on, and he was screaming, 

and I heard what he was saying, 
and he want to know when I had gotten this. And then an 
other traveler [indecipherable]
 speak, he says, ﬁHe wants to
 know the date
 you got it.ﬂ I 
said, ﬁOh, that™s on it.ﬂ And 
-- but you know, and the other 
five hadn™t found anything, 
and they all came in this compart ment, and they
 gave one look at my I.D., and they burst 
out laughing. And after the war -- I never kne
w till after I got out what had gone. They 
had printed -- and you saw the copy, in deep
 purple, and it had all the data, and a 
background like money that you can™t falsify, but 
one of the little th
ings was nationality 
Dutch. And that was printed in deep purple.
 But everybody 14 and over had to go and get 
that I.D., so in the begi nning we had I thi
nk about nine million inhabitants, and a lot --  

millions over 14, so they had handed out millions
. And after that -- that was in the end 
™40 -- beginning of ™41, they handed out to
 everybody who turned 14, then you had to go. 
And in ™43, they ran -- ran out, they had no more. And they printed exactly the same , 

everything, except those to -- tw
o little words nationality Dutch, instead of deep purple, 
in black. And if you don™t know it, you could ba
rely see it. And I had one of the last 
robbery, and it was a black one, so that wa
s printed in ™43, but the guy who ma de the 
false papers, wrote automa tically I think ™42 or some thing. If he had done a duplicate that 

I™d lost it ™43, I would have been okay. But on 
that I was arrested, and later that man from 
the governme nt, he said, ﬁOh, you had a black -- 
you had a black nationality.ﬂ He said so 
ma ny were arrested. So then the underground 
started to check and 
found that. So after 
that they did those all duplicate, and la
ter date, but I was one of the victims.  
 

Q: Did -- did the undergroundfigure it out, what happened? 

 

A: Yeah, after -- 

 

Q: Yeah, they figured it out. 

 

A: The -- there were so ma ny arrested, re
latively, you know. So they knew there was 
some thing, and then they went over that. It wa
s really -- I always th
ink it was nearly like 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
68 
 
 
a chess game . You do this, we do that, you do this. And here they had a smart 
[indecipherable]. So -- 
 

Q: So they look at this, they™re laughing, and now what 
do they do, do they search you? 

 

A: And then the trai n stops in Rotterdam. 

 

Q: Uh-huh. 

 

A: And it™s a big station, one of 
the biggest in the Netherlands, 
and they said out, and they 
had a little office there, and they looked
 through my little [indecipherable] and I had 
some data, but I had made my own shortha
nd that nobody else could 
read, and this -- oh, 
this is spy material. I said no, and then they
 wanted to know -- they said, ﬁWell, if you 
don™t talk,ﬂ and I s -- I sai
d, ﬁI don™t know what you™re sa
ying, I d -- I don™t understand 
German.ﬂ They said, ﬁOkay, you go to the headqu
arters.ﬂ And that is where they did this 

stuff, so I was really sc ared. Back to 
the station, and it was a chilly da y, it was May 
eighth, ™44, and it was drizzle --
 like now, drizzle and rain. And we have ma ny benc hes 
on this -- on the station and everywhere, but
 nobody was sitting, because it was so chilly, 
so they were all walking. And it was crow
ded, because there were so ma ny -- so few 
trains, and ma ny peopl e. And they said to me , ﬁSit here.ﬂ And then the leader of the 

group, he had a higher rank, he was standing he
re, kind of facing the other five, and the 
other five we re in a horseshoe, five facing me
. And I thought this is the end of my life, 
because now I go to prison, and I knew you had to undress, and then when my blous e, I 

had buttons, you know, I thought, when 
they find that [indecipherable] 
 

Q: You had all the papers -- 
 
A: I had all the papers 
from the robbery there. 
 

Q: In your bra. 

 

A: I had it in my bra, and it 
was stolen I.D.s, and there were 
two pilots who wanted to get to 
England, and they were in that age group, so 
we had to give them also the papers. And 
there was a way to get back 
to England via Belgium, France, over the Pyrenees to 

Portugal, and then a submarine would pick th
em up. And we have helped sa -- several, 
and when they were in England they gave secr
et code that we knew th
ey were there. But -
- and for those guys, if they were stopped,they couldn™t speak Dutch. And so they had 

the Dutch papers, and if you had like the -- wher
e the Jew was the J, if you had a big scar, 
or at that time you still had pe
ople with what they call that 
-- those red -- now they can 
with ice get that off when you™re a new baby, but
 at that time it was called a veinflak. It™s 
a big thing that -- a scar of 
thing, and everything special. So 
on that -- for those guys we 
always wrote deaf and dumb. And we sai
d, ﬁIf you are arrested, don™t say a word, and 

you don™t hear.ﬂ  
 

Q: Right,right.

A: So -- but we got ma ny back to Engla
nd. And then -- but you know, I was brought in, I 
was sitting there, and I was praying there wa
s [indecipherable] for those, and there were 
500 guilders because by -- it was towa rds the 
end, and ma ny J e wish people didn™t have  
money any more. And in the cities we had to
 pay the people some thing that they could 
buy the food, you know, and the Jewish people 
we re so eager also, collecting money 
fr om people who didn™t dare to do dangerous th
ings, but were willing to contribute, so it 
was a busy time . And then they --I -- I was 
praying to God, I thought, oh, this is the end 
of my life, when I go 
to prison I have to undress, and th
ey find that, and I™ll be shot 
[indecipherable]. And I thought of my wedding 
dress hanging at home, and the -- all the 
expectations we had. And I was praying to
 God, and pleading. I sa
id, ﬁWe are helping 
your people, and then,ﬂ -- a
nd I says, ﬁYou are Almi ghty,ﬂ a
nd I was really pleading with 
God, I said, ﬁYou are Almi ghty, can you give a mo
me nt that all people
 don™t look at me , 
and that I can get rid of that envelope.ﬂ 
Then I™m still in a 
bind, they are looking 
[indecipherable] then I had a chance, but here
 I ha ve no chance. A
nd then I always say, 
huma nly speaking, when five pe
ople are watching you, what are 
your chance that all five 
don™t look? You can say zero. If it was one he 
could be looking anot
her way, if there are 
two, they could be looking. But five?  And I alwa
ys say it says in the Bible with God, and 
with God all things are possible. And the guy 
who was standing here, he
 had a raincoat of 
stuff we had never seen. And at that time  the 
fashion was that  all the raincoats were made 
of gabardine, and only pockets here in th
e side. Nobody ever had 
-- and inside pockets 
had never -- in no coat, you had not have it 
happen. And he had a shiny coat, it was a 
military coat, battleship gray. And one of the Germans, I heard him say, ﬁIs that  that new 
ma terial?  Is it really waterproof? ﬂ  It was the 
first plastic, plastic 
had just been found out. 
And then another, I heard a
ll what they said, said, oh, 
and how nice, it had two big 
stitched on pockets. Those pockets, that is 
handy, that had never -- and this tall guy said, 
he said, ﬁYou think that is handy? ﬂ  He sai
d, ﬁThis coat has pockets on the inside.ﬂ Now, 
they had never -- and they all said, ﬁOn the in
side?ﬂ He said yeah, and he opens his coat, 
right, and he was over six feet, 
and all the five heads went 
in the raincoat to admi re. 
 
Q: So how did you get out the -- 

 

A: I had opened my blouse -- 

 

Q: Already? 

 

A: I -- I needed -- yeah, when I st
arted praying, I™d opened the blouse. 
 

Q: So you were ready. 

 

A: And I had only to grab it and throw it. 

 

Q: And where did you throw it? 

 

A: Well, there were loads of people walk
ing, hundreds were walking up and down, this 
could be anybody™s. So then they would ha
ve had to arrest the whole station. And 

whoever found this was lucky, he had the ration cards, he had 500 guilders -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
70 
 
 
 
Q: Right. 

 

A: -- and the rest he can have thrown away, but -- 

 

Q: But these guys didn™t fi
nd this?  They didn™t -- 
 

A: No, because they didn™t know I had it on 
me , of c ourse, so they didn™t even look. And 
then I wanted to get away from it, so I sa
id -- and one guy could speak a bit Dutch, I said, 
ﬁI am so chilly.ﬂ And I was. I said, ﬁCan we
 stand in that tunnel?
ﬂ Because there were 
tunnels that go to the next plat
form, and I heard him say to th
e other, ﬁLet me  alone with 
her, I™ll get it out.ﬂ I thought, ﬁYeah, that™s 
what you think.ﬂ But I 
didn™t know any of 
what he said. So we stand in the tunnel, 
and you -- when you are so long in that work, 
you get really a look at people, that you -- and 
I saw he was very vain, and so I started the 
conversation, and he could speak some Du
tch. I said, ﬁNow, when you go through those 

trains, what are you looking fo
r?ﬂ Like I was [indecipherable]. He said, ﬁOh, for spies.ﬂ I 
said, ﬁFor spies? ﬂ I said, ﬁA
nd -- and who -- how do you find them? ﬂ  And he start -- he 
said, ﬁYeah, two days ago we had a guy, and he
 had all secret films, and,ﬂ -- I said, 
ﬁ What did you do?  Shoot him? ﬂ He said, ﬁNo.ﬂ 
He said, ﬁHe tried to run away.ﬂ I said, 
ﬁAnd what did you [indecipherable]
 shoot him? ﬂ He said, ﬁNo.ﬂ
 I said, ﬁI can run hard. 
May I run away? ﬂ  I said to hi
m, ﬁDo I get a head start? ﬂ 
So I was joking, like I wasn™t 
nervous at all. And I talked 
the whole time, and then the train pulled up, and he had this 
big head, and he had [indecipherable] didn™t 
have a word [indecipherable]. And then I 
heard him again say to the others, ﬁLeave me  al
one with her in the apartment, I -- in the 
compart ment, I get it out.ﬂ And I went on in 
the train. But then -- oh, I ran from one fe ar 
and another, I -- later whenI looked back, I thought, oh G
od, I should have cracked up. 
Because the train ended, and there -- then we
 had to take a tram to Scheveningen, and 
that was line eight, and it was 
around five o™clock, and that 
tram went exactly past the 
bank where I had worked, and the people left
 at five. And I thought, oh God, if any of 
them -- and it™s raining, hops
 on, say hi Diet, I™m sunk. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: I -- from one fear and another. And I want
ed also to know the people, and because they 
had -- the uniforme d people left
, and the two in civil, with
 the insignias on -- and I was 
such [indecipherable], and they left me . So we
 sit in the tram, and 
then you had a conduct 
-- conductor who collected the money. So he cam
e to me , a nd I said, ﬁI™m not paying.ﬂ 
He said, ﬁYou have to.ﬂ I said, ﬁNo.ﬂ He sa id, ﬁThen I throw you off the tram.ﬂ I said, 

ﬁPlease,ﬂ because I sit he -- I said, ﬁI™m sitti
ng here very much against my  will.ﬂ And he 

said, ﬁWhat? ﬂ I said, ﬁYeah, those two guys,ﬂ 
ﬁthey have put me  here.ﬂ And he said, 
ﬁ What?ﬂ I said, ﬁYeah, those two guys,ﬂ and th
ey had -- said, ﬁthey have put me  here.ﬂ 
He said, ﬁOh, la -- you™re fur 
[indecipherable] you got -- you™re 
arrested? ﬂ I said yes. So 
the whole tram kne w that they were two Ger man
s, and that they were arresting me , and I 
thought, if the tram gets in a jam, they pr
obably help me  that I can shoot out of it 

[indecipherable] to -- to the prison -- off to 
the headquarters of the Gestapo. And there I 
had to sit for hours, because you had those spec
ial cars that they arrest people, and they 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
71 
 
 
have a special name , betsies, or something, 
I don™t know what. But anyway, there was not 
one, they were out to collect Jews, and wh
atever, they had to 
sit there for hours. 
 
Q: We™re gonna -- we™re gonna 
have to change the tape. 
 

A: Okay. 

 

Q: Okay. 

 

End of Tape #6

Tape #7 
 
Q: Okay. Diet, so you™re wa iting in the pr ison, and how come  they™re ma king you wait, do 
you think?  Do you know? 
 

A: In that -- they -- in that building of the 
Gestapo, the headquarters, I had to wait because 
they were -- they had big, black yar -- cars 
that they brought you to
 prison and arrested 
you apart from if they had the whole group, th
ey did it on trucks with machine guns. But 

they were wa l -- waiting for [indecipherable] because they we re doing raids in The 

Hague, and arresting people, probably Jewish 
people. So I had to 
wait a couple of hours, 
and then they brought me to the prison. And it 
was the same  arrogant guy who was in the 
train. And he could speak Dutch, and I reme mbe r
 that in that car he says to me , ﬁYeah, 
now I can™t help you, you™re a young girl, and I feel so sorry
 that you go to prison now, 
but you didn™t tell any, now you have to go to 
prison,ﬂ he said. ﬁBut if you still tell me  
how you got this paper,ﬂ he says, ﬁthen you get 
very special pr -- tr
eatment in -- in the 
prison. You get -- ma y choose every day what
 you want to eat, and you get every time 
with your meal a glass of wine.ﬂ And I t
hought, how stupid does he 
think I am?  I -- I 
knew definitely that wasn™t true. I mean, how 
stupid?  So I just played along, and I said, 
ﬁYeah, real -- really? ﬂ  And you 
know, in Dutch?  And he says 
yes. I said, ﬁMay I even 
choose appelmoes? ﬂ Wa s applesauce, and that™s
 -- it™s such a stupid word, appelmoes, 
and I thought that he would then realize. 
He said, ﬁOh yeah, you ma y choose appelmoes.ﬂ 
Well, I said, ﬁI -- I can™t -- I 
don™t -- I have this paper, and I don™t know.ﬂ So anyway, 
then we came to the -- the 
prison, where Milosevic is now, that™s a big prison for 
criminals. But it had a big, high wall, and it ha
d a small side door, 
and it™s round, and it™s 
still there. And -- and there wa
s a bell that you can press, a
nd they stood there, and they 
had told me , don™t show that you™re ascare
d, you know, and we were standing there, and 
he said, ﬁYou can still tell me, I haven™t ye
t presse d, you can still tell me .ﬂ And then I 
took his thumb, and I pressed it. And he gave
 me a whack. But then I wa s brought in, and 
he disappeared, and I had to stand for a longtime in a corridor, and on one side are all 

cells. And I had to face the wall, and stood th
ere for a long time , and out of the cells I 
heard all voices, and they said, ﬁWhat is the 
news from the outside world, what is the 
news from the outside world? ﬂ But I didn™t know
 if these were Gestapo guys who wanted 
to check, so I -- I feel always guilty, because
 if they were real 
prisoners, I thought I 
should have told, but I didn™t wa
nt to take the chance. And 
then they brought me , it had 
ma ny corridors, A, B, C, D, and I was in corridor A, in cell six, some  that -- the 

handkerchief, I think it was six 
or eight. And they put me  in, and it was three me ter, now 
that™s a little bit longer than three yards, 
and two me ter, right?  And it had -- I didn™t know 
that -- a drum in the corner, and only one co
t, and it was meant for one person, so small. 
And very high window with bars. And I was 
number five, there were four others. And 
there was an old Jewish lady, Mrs. Spire, a
nd she had the cot, and 
we slept on stone, on 
the floor. It -- it was a prison for criminals,
 so I didn™t know what are the other wome n, 
you know, they could be criminals, they c
ould be [indecipherable] they could be 
anything, but the Jewish lady I knew was okay. 
And I had been the whole day in the he 
train, telling all the guys, and I had been si
tting at that st ation, and then in the 
headquarters of the Gestapo, and then I had to 
go so urgent bathroom, so I said to those 
ladies, how -- ﬁWhat do you do?  I have to go 
bathroom? ﬂ  And I thought that they say, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
73 
 
 
well you have to go -- knock at the door and th
en they bring you to 
a toilet. And they 
turned around, and they pointed 
at this little drum. And I -- 
you know -- that this was the 
time now you go camping, and women shower to
gether, and there is no -- but this was 
1944, and everything was so proper. And I t
hought, I™m not going on a thing with those 
wome n that I™ve neve r seen. But you know, I coul
dn™t hold it until after the war, so at one 
point my pride went out of the window, and I 
had to go on the tippultum, a nd that™s what 
it was called. Oh goody. 
 
Q: So, had they questioned you at 
the Ge stapo headquarters or not? 
 

A: They asked me  all questions, but
 I couldn™t speak 
German, so -- 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: They didn™t ge -- 

 

Q: So are -- are you beginning to
 play some one very dumb? 

 

A: I started then, because first you know, I was 
kind of that I didn™t answer, I was -- and that 
I pushed, I thought it was kind of -- when you
™re going to -- but then I thought, hey, I 
have to do dumb. And then I never spoke Germ
a n already, but then I really pretended, 
and when they ask me  I shrug my shoulders. An
d I think later that saved me. I think that 
they let me out that they had -- they didn™t 
ha ve trains any more because the queen has 
spoken from England, and said that all the pe
ople who worked for the railroad had to go 
in hiding, too. So all the Jews were in hi
ding orwa y, all the men between 16 and 45, and 

now all the railroad, and the queen said, a
nd their fa milies have  to go in hiding, too, 
because in ™44, the end -- they were so mean, 
if t hey came to arrest a ma n and he wasn™t 

home , they took his wife, the children, the 
baby. If you were pregnant they took you. And 
then the man came back and was shot, so it 
was a crazy world, and there were not enough 

trains any more. So -- but we were brought there. 
 

Q: So you™re in a cell with four other wome n?  

 

A: I™m in a cell with those ot her four women. 
And then I was so lucky, because the Jewish 
lady was brought out, and every Tuesday, a
nd every Thursday night my heart broke 
because then they had rounded up the Jews, put them in the prison, and then they 

separated the me n and the wome n, and the 
children. Oh. And then you heard them, 
[indecipherable] ma ma -- ma ma . It wa
s terr ible, terribl e. And then -- 
 

Q: What were they doing every Tuesday and T
hursday, were -- they were sending the Jews 
out to We sterbork? 
 

A: Then they -- all the people that they
 had arrested were 
brought to We sterbork. 
 

Q: And then they were deported from West
erbork, right? So who were these other three 
wome n with you, do you know? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
74 
 
 
 
A: Now, the Jewish lady was taken out 

 

Q: Right. 

 

A: And then an other young woma n ca me in. Bu
t see, this was in the dunes, in The Hague. 
That prison is right on the edge of the dunes,
 and in the dunes, that was sperrgebiet, it 
was forbidden territory. And they have ma
de ma ny bunkers [indecipherable] to England, 
and there was also the place of execution, a
nd that was known Waalsdorp. And I™ll spell 
that later with Elizabeth. But that was th
e place of execution, a
nd they had already 
executed so ma ny peopl e, but you c
ouldn™t get there. And then -- 
 

Q: Did you hear it? 

 

A: No, it was farther in the dunes, no -- 

 

Q: You couldn™t hear it, so -- I see. 

 

A: -- it was farther in the dunes, but we kne
w it, that was the place of execution. But it wa s 
right on the border of the koshda 
dunes, and then the osh -- the North Sea. And at the -- in 
the morning we got that rusty cup, we had to st
ick that out, and they
 poured in a -- in the 
door was a little thing that 
they could open, and then you had to come , and the -- often it 
was bohoi -- boiling hot brown water, it wasn™t
 coffee, they poured over your hands, that 
you burned, but it was all you get, and at lunc
htime -- anyway, there was nothing except 
that -- but that young girl came 
in, she was I think 22 or 23, about my age . And when the 
allies flew over, because they dropped bombs 
some ti me s, if they knew that they were 
building some thing [indecipherable] and that has to be, I mean, but it is scary if you™re 

sitting in the cell and you hear bombs falli
ng close by. But we knew that we would never 
get in -- gotten free without sacr
ifices, and if it wa s us, so be it. But we always, when we 
heard our friends in the sky, that were
 our hope, you know, and then everybody went, 

because there was a cell left, and right, and 
in the back. And then you went to the hole, 
and you started knocking, and knocking, and knoc
king. And they did it, and with a whole 

bunch, but the whole prison was nearly trembli
ng like it was our friends are in the sky, 
one day we will all be free. And this happened 
when she was there, but this girl comes in, 
I can™t remember her name. 
 

Q: Is it Soni a? 

 

A: No, that was not Sonia, no that was anothe
r one. She wanted to, with
 her beauty to -- to 
[indecipherable] she was Jewish. [inaudible]
. Anyway, this girl come s in, and -- 
 

Q: Barzilai is her last name? 

 

A: Barzilai, yeah, Sonia Barzilai, I felt so sorry for her. 

 

Q: Uh-huh. But -- so this is another woma n?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
75 
 
 
 
A: Yeah, this wa s a young girl, and she come s i
n, and here we are -- she was the fifth one, 
and she comes up to me  when we had introduced ourself, and she says to me , ﬁ You 

know, I know that I™ll be out very soon. Do you have a me ssage for the outside world? ﬂ 

And I thought, ﬁThat is crazy, why doe
sn™t she ask the others also? ﬂ 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: And so that was already fishy. And all 
the time she came to me, and I thought -- and I 
said, ﬁListen,ﬂ I said, ﬁyou both -- you a
ll know, when you are here, you never know that 
you™re out in a few days, it™s impossible. Y
ou don™t know how long.ﬂ And then in the end 
she said, ﬁWell, I™m engaged to a German, 
but he is a good German.ﬂ I thought that for 
me  there are no good Germans at the mo me nt. 
I thought -- and she said, ﬁNo, but he -- I 
know he gets me  out.ﬂ And I said, ﬁNo, I have
 no fa mily here, and I™m just a ma id and 

the people where I am, they don™
t really care for me , they onl
y care now that the laundry 
isn™t being done.ﬂ I said, ﬁA
nd I -- now I have no -- nobody who is interested in me .ﬂ So I 
didn™t bite. But then the next night, the alli
es flew over and dropped a bomb real close by, 
so we run to our walls. And she ran to th
e front door where the guards we re, and she 
[indecipherable], ﬁlet me  out, let me  out [ind
ecipherable] allies, and let me out, you know 
I don™t belong here.ﬂ So she was planted. And 
I see everywhere God™s hand, because this 
was at the very beginning of
 my -- of my prison time , so I kne w don™t trust anybody. It™s 
the lesson I got. 
 

Q: But you don™t remember  her name? 

 

A: No. 
 
Q: No. 

 

A: Don™t reme mber her name . A
nd then I -- she was there so sh
ort, just two or three days. 
And then we were brought -- the invasion came,
 and then they got very nervous, and we 
were all loaded in -- in trains, and in -- in 
-- really in trucks. And see, Corrie and Betsie 
ten Boom, you™ve heard that name , of course
, too. But they came from another city, 
Haarlem, and I never heard of them, we didn™
t know what they were doing. But we were 
from The Hague, a lot of us -- 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: -- and we were driven in the dunes. A
nd when you came out of the prison, you came on 
the long lane that was called 
the van Alke ma delaan, and 
the city, and the railroad 
stations were to the right. And to the le
ft was only the dunes and 
the place of execution. 
And they drove us to the left, so the Dutc
h -- the Hague people thought we  are going to 
be executed, and I thought so, too. So you ha
d to prepare yourself for being shot. And I 
know that several -- there were
 so many, there were 1800 I heard later. So we were in 
loads of trucks. And some of The Hague pe
ople were so scared they jumped out, and 
there were soldiers sitting 
with machine gun -- with mi  -- mitarios machine guns, I think 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
76 
 
 
you called it. There was no point, a-and I don™
t know, we have dune
s in Michigan the 
Great Bear dunes, you can™t r
un in dunes, it™s sand, and 
it goes up, there wa s no way, it 
wasn™t practical, so we went there. But then
 later my father told me  -- he was born in 
1883, that when there were no cars yet, and th
ere were a couple of ve
ry expensive hotels, 
one was the Oranje Hotel, the Orange  Hote
l, and development people came to the big 
station, and for those people, there were no car
s yet, and they -- they didn™t have any 
suitcases, especially not this [indecipherable
], they had big trunks for [indecipherable]. 
So they had ma de a side branch with a little 
train that came  to flu -- near the hotels. But 
over the decades, that was totally covered w
ith sand, and some  of the Nazi Dutch people 
must have known that, so ha -- they had unear
thed that station, and they were afraid to 
ship us from in The Hague itself, they t
hought -- and -- they did it in Amst erdam, and 
there was a big riot, and a fi
ght, that the underground wanted to liberate the people from 
there. So they avoided that, a
nd they brought us there in the 
dunes, so we were not shot, 
we were loaded in trains. Crammed in trai ns, and I was in the same comp artment with 
Corrie and Betsie ten Boom, so that was 
the first time, and you know that story, of 
course, ma ybe you™ve read, ﬁThe Hiding Place,ﬂ and some  other -- 
 

Q: I did, but summarize it 
a little bit. They -- 
 

A: -- of the [indecipherable]. And they were in 
their 50™s, so I thought at
 that time they were 
old ladi es. And they were each in a cell be
cause they thought that Corrie had tee -- 
tuberculosis. And their old fath
er, he was a very wonderful 
Christian, and he was a very 
distinguished gentlema n, very well known in H
aarlem, they had an exclusive watch story 
-- s-s-store, and when all the Jews had to wear
 a star, he went too. 
He said, ﬁThey are my 
people, and I am a Christian,ﬂ and he wo
re the star . But they were arre sted 
[indecipherable]. So -- and their old father had 
just died in that pr
ison, so they me t each 
other, and Corrie and Betsie met each other then, on that trip. They 
were sitting hand in 

hand and crying, and then I heard their story fr
om the other prisoners. And then the train 
was also black, when -- you know, curtains, th
at not a light shown, 
and we didn™t know 
where we were going. But the noise changed, we 
went -- so I knew, I thought if we got in 
Germany, the chances for survival would pfft. 
And if we stay in the Netherlands, and in 
the south you had a -- a Vught, and in the 
mi ddle you had Amersfoort, Camp Amersfoort. 
So we didn™t know where we were going, it wa
s dark and all the curtains were down, it 
was night. And then all of a sudden, the whole 
noise changed, and it was so -- and then I 
knew we we re going sout h, that we were going -- because -- you saw on the ma p the 

cities of Zwijndrecht and Door
drect, but there is a big, big 
river, and that™s called at 
Hollands Diep, and that is so big, and there 
is a large bridge over 
it, and we were going 
over that bridge, and I had done that ma ny tim
es  on my bike. And then I knew that we 
were going to Vught. And at one point there 
was a toilet, and everybody stood in line to 
go to the toilet. And when it was quiet, that
 there was nobody, I see a 
girl go in, and I see 
that she -- there was 
a window, and that was also -- but 
I saw that she took the black 
curtain up, and there was glass, and you c
ould open that, and I 
thought that she had 
opened it, but there were soldiers with m
achine guns on the roof of the train, and I 
thought she knows this area, and I thought sh
e™s trying to escape. But if some body goe s 
in -- so I stood at the door 
like I would be the next one. I 
thought I™ll give her a chance. 
And then at one point, we  went through a woode
d area, very curvy so the train had to go 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
77 
 
 
slow. And I saw her jump. So then she jumped out of that window, and she rolled -- I 
don™t know, we went further, but the train went
 slow, so I said a prayer that she would 
ma ke it safe. And then I went to the bathroom
, I didn™t have to go, but I had given her the 
chance. So I went back, and we came in th
e camp, and then they counted, all -- eight 

prisoners had escaped on that trip, so -- 
 

Q: Eight? 

 

A: Eight. So I knew one of them, I hope that sh
e survived. But I felt r
eally great. And then 
we were brought in that -- wa
s in the night, I think we a
rrived at two o™clock in the 
woods. We  had to get out. There were all 
soldiers with helmets, and bayonets and 
screaming -- 
 

Q: Did they do some thing because they knew th
at there were eight escapees? Were they -- 
 

A: Well, this wa s when we -- they count us
 inside, we  weren™t yet in the camp. But you 
know, the train with prisoners came, so th
en there are soldiers, and we were 80 
[indecipherable] prisoners, so they we re [i
ndecipherable] warned that we would be 
punished. They didn™t have [indecipherable] fo
r us. What was unexpected was the day of 
the invasion. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: And then -- 

 

Q: Did they care that there were ei
ght people who escaped?  They didn™t care? 
 

A: I don™t know, they were furious, they -- all 
the time  we had role call, or some thing, and 
counting -- 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: And I don™t know if they ever found out who, 
because it was a chaos with the invasion, 
you know, the -- and then we were -- and there were big Dobermans, and we were pushed 

into the camp, and then we were in di -- 
 

Q: There were Dobermans? Dogs? 
 
A: Doberman dogs, and soldiers, so they -- I 
mean, you didn™t get a chance to escape, they 
were [indecipherable] 
 

Q: Right,right. 

 

A: -- and guys had bayonets and 
guns, and whatever. And later we
 went in a barrack number 
four, and that was really a camp within a cam
p, because see now, if you had three or four 
of one case, they kept you in different cells 
that you couldn™t agree you
™ll say this or  that. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
78 
 
 
But now we were just ma shed together, and 
they [indecipherable] guards, and we weren™t 
allowed to say one word to each ot her. A
nd then we were all brought to a separate 
barrack, the wome n number 75, and the me n we
re brought some where else. And for days 
we couldn™t speak to each other.
 Day and night that we were 
not allowed to say a word to 
each other, till they had quick interrogated th
e keepall -- the people from the same cases. 
And then after a couple of w
eeks, I think, then they stayed
 the whole day with us, the 
fe ma le guards, and on the four corners were f
our S.S.™s, and the S.S.™s were the volunteer 
Hitler elitengrup, and they -- they had thei
r awesome -- you know, the swastika is from 
the Nazis, but the S.S. had the wolfs angel, 
they had that sign lik
e that. And they -- on 
each corner were always S.S.™s in every 
barrack, four. And this was May, June, July, 
August. And I reme mber it was very hot, and 
we have nothing there. We  got cots, and 
very thin ma ttresses, and three high in long ro
ws, of course, like in all the barracks. And 

then the only thing we had -- there wa s a wa
shroom -- washroom, and that had drofs and 
a pipe, and fa ucets. But that was all, 
we had no soap, no shampoo, no towels, no toilet 
paper, no nothing. And I was arrested in my cl
othes, so if I wanted
 to wash any of my 
underwear, then I must [indecipherable] 
it out till it had dried [indecipherable] 
 

Q: So there was -- there was no unifo
rm, you could just wear clothes? 
 

A: Not yet, later -- 

 

Q: Later there was. 

 

A: -- later I got a pr
ison dress, but -- 
 

Q: Isee. 
 
A: -- I had no clean underwear, or
 anything, I was arrested with
 what I had worn. So that 
was very hard. And then, because they checked us, and the other girl had to ma ke the 

twine, and I was picked out there, ﬁOh, you
™re a ma id, you have to do the laundry,ﬂ of 

those guards, and from a whole bunch of guards,
 and I got two other girls to help me , but 
I was the ma id, so I have to be the leader. A
nd on the -- on their shirts
 they had that wolfs 
angel embroidered, and I hated that more 
than the swastika. And this women -- the 
guards, they had to take turns, and there we
 stood, three, and it 
was all [indecipherable] 
stuff, because there were no laundry machines
. So then -- some ti me s they got so bored, 
you know, to sit there and see those three girl s the whole day, and they locked us up and 

they went away for a beer, or a coffee, or
 whatever. And when they were gone -- and 
don™t forget, I was in my  early 20™s then, a
nd then we took that sh-shirt and undershirt, 
with that hated swastika on -- no, the -- the 
wolfs angel, and we  got a nice big gob of 
saliva, bull™s-eye. And this -- 
but every day when we were alone, and every day we went 
a little bit back, and we got so good in aimi ng.It was really -- and later, you know, Corrie 

ten Boom as ked me  later to be with her, a
nd help her to arrange a home for  the Jewish 
people who now had nobody, she had a home for.
 Cases that didn™t go to sanitorium 
[indecipherable]. So she had that, and I helped
 her those six weeks. And she had a friend 
who was a psychiatrist, and he wanted to talk
 to her. At that time, if you went to a 
psychiatrist, they thought you were nuts, you kno
w, that was -- so no, we didn™t want it, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
79 
 
 
didn™t need it. But he was so interested, so in
 the end we said okay, 
and then I asked him, 
I said, ﬁYou must think that we 
were crazy, that we got such 
a kick out of spitting on that 
-- on that horrible thing that we hated while our
 lives were at stake.
ﬂ And he said, ﬁNo,ﬂ 
he said, ﬁthey tried to break your spirit, a
nd they couldn™t, so that was a good thing.ﬂ 
Because if we had been naughty, we had to stand 
there, appe l had -- now that is horrible -
- it -- it doesn™t sound horrible, but you had 
to stand, ma rble, youknow, with your thing 
here at the side, and you weren™t allowed 
to move. And you know, after seven mi nutes 
you start swaying, and they fainted left and 
the right, and then all those guards were 
sitting there and laughing. And we put a smile
 on our face when they ma de us do that. 
Like we got those delicious c ookies, like they had given us 
some thing nice and we stood 
there, and we fainted left and right, and th
ey got ma d at us. And I reme mb er that they 
said, ﬁDie Hollandische weiber sind schlimme
r wie die Polakken.ﬂ The Dutch -- and then 
weiber is a degrading word, here weif is a 
norma l word, but it™s a degrading word, you ha 
-- the Dutch wo me n wer e  worse than th
e Polakken, than the Polish. That was 
[indecipherable] and then they yelled at [i
ndecipherable] like they had given us a great 
compli me nt, you know, like [indecipherable] you 
are perfect, and we stood there, and 
they were furious, but that we
re all our little fun thing. 
 

Q: Why -- why was that insi
gnia of the S.S. wor -- 
 

A: The wolfs angel? 

 

Q: The wolfs ang -- wolfs angel, why was that worse to you than the swastika, do you think? 

 

A: Because the swastika was the 
general Nazi thing, but this 
was volunteers, and they were 
trained in cruelty. They could blindly obey, and th
ey were trained -- I read that when they 
started -- they are volunteers,
 so they signed up for this, th
en they got an -- a new puppy, 
a -- a German Shepherd puppy, and I don™t know if
 the training was two or three years, 
but at the fina l exam, now dog is your friend, 
and they had just [indecipherable] to kill 
their dog. That -- they could do anything. A
nd I heard [indecipherable] from another 
friend of mi ne, who went through so ma ny ca mp
s , and he was later the head editor of a 
very high standing Dutch ma gazine that
 came, The Alsafeer, that™s one of 
[indecipherable] and he went th
rough so ma ny c a mps, and if he saw a scrap of paper, he 
wrote some thing down, and he put it in cracks 
fro m in the wall, or  whatever, and after the 

war, he picked it all up, and he wrote 
a book, ﬁNacht und Nebel,ﬂ [indecipherable]. I 
don™t know if you™ve heard about it. And they
 volunteered. I mean, what they did fi -- 
they said, kill this pr
isoner, and they were free to do it.
 They hung them, a nd then they 
were nearly dead, they got them down that
 they could breathe again, they did that 
someti mes three times with the same -- now is
 that cruelty?  I mean 
-- no, I hated that sign 
more because  that was volunteers who did that. 
 

Q: Now, when you™re in Vught, you can™t tell 
any of these wome n who you really are, so 
you not only have to be hiding from the 
Germans who are going to question you, but you 
have no -- you™re totally alone. 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
80 
 
 
A: I was totally alone, and you know, I scraped 
in the wall of the prison, because they took 
everything away, but that was the time  of
 the bobby pins, and they had not taken my 
bobby pin, and all the other wome n did -- to ke
ep the date [indecipherable] so all the 
others did one, two, three, four, five, that -- 
from the days that they
 were -- so I didn™t 
have to do that. But the very last word our Jesu
s said before he went back to heaven was, 
lo, I am with you always. And I scared that 
in the wall, and I thought I™m never alone. So 
-- and that™s what I had to cling to. And I ne
ver felt alone, I knew He was always there. I 
trusted. Yeah, that was -- but it was a very 
rough time and in the end, I™ve got two people 
that I™ve trusted. And that was -- one was a 
Catholic girl, she was in about the same  
situation, I don™t know how I got
 to trust her. And the othe
r was a lady, and her name  was 
Mrs. Verschoor. And she was in her 40™s, and 
the suffering was engraved on her face. It™s 
so intense sad, and it really st
ruck me . And I asked others, ﬁW
hat is the matter?  What is 
this hurt? ﬂ And they told me  she had onl
y one daughter, Yoka, and the girl was 18, 
studying at the university, and she had helped
 pilots all the time escape, and she was 
arrested, you heard her name  [indecipherable]
 Yoka Verschoor. And she was arrested, 
and she was nacht und nebel and it was th
at you disappear, nobody knew any more. So 
Mrs. Verschoor did not. And then some body sa id yeah, and they lived in Pa rami bo, and 
that struck a chord because on my false pa
pers I was born in Parami bo. And one day -- 
we were 175 wome n in the camp, and there wa
s a very famo us film star. Like here, 
everybody knew Judy Garland, some thing similar, Ennie Meunier. And she was -- and 

Ennie was there, now, why the heck is Ennie 
Meunier in this camp?  And I asked others, 
and they said she is engaged to a Germa
n. So right away [indecipherable] I don™t know 
what™s the ma tter. So one day Ennie Meunier
 hears that I was born in Pa rami bo, and I 
didn™t know a thing about Parami bo. I knew muc h
 about Indonesia because so much of 

my fa mily and my brother, so ma ny had b
een there. But I didn™t know a thing about 
Parami bo. And she come , ﬁHi Willie, I hear you were born in Parami bo.ﬂ And I said yes. 
And she said, ﬁ Where did you live?ﬂ A street --
 I had no idea about a street name , but we 
all had diarrhea, and then you could run away. 
I said, ﬁOh, I™ll talk 
to you later.ﬂ And I 
ran away to the bathroom, and then afterwar
d I avoided her like 
the plague, because I 
knew -- oh no, she says to me , ﬁ We were on [i
ndecipherable], I mean, we  were there, did 
you see me ,ﬂ in a big play. I said, ﬁNo, my father
 was just on leave, he hated it so much 
to mi ss that.ﬂ  Because in a small Dutch community, that™s a bi g thing. And she said, 
ﬁOh.ﬂ And then she asked me  where I liv
ed, and I thought oh no, so I ran away and 
pretended I had diarrhea. And then oh, she co
me s back, and what do I say, and if she™s 
engaged to a German -- who is engaged to a 
German during this time? So I was really 
scared. And then I had heard th
at Mrs. Verschoor had lived th
ere, and we all had diarrhea 
bouts, and then you were allowed -- they were 
allowed to leave their paper stuff, and I 
had to go. So I saw that Mrs. Verschoor ran 
to the bathroom, and there were 10 on a row, 
and we had to go in groups, and were 
watched by a fe ma le guard. Anyway, Mrs. 
Verschoor runs, so I run, and I sat next to her, and -- 
 

Q: Hold that. We™re going to st
op the tape, and we™ll start -- 
 

A: [indecipherable]back? 

 

Q: Yes, we™re going to stop, 
and start at the next tape.

Tape #8 
 
Q: Diet, we left off when you 
went into the latrine to -- 
 

A: Oh yeah, and then I asked this lady, I said, ﬁDon™t ask me  any questions, but tell me  
anything about Parami bo.ﬂ And I said, ﬁA stre
et, where do people live
, regular people.ﬂ 
She says, ﬁHeerenstraat,ﬂ and she told me  all 
about it. So that was 
-- and then after the 
war I went to her house. She got out and he
r daughter got out. And, well -- so I know 
that. But that helped me , and when Enni
e Meunier then came , I knew something. 
 

Q: So you weren™t afraid when she came any more? 

 

A: Well, I didn™t like it, but at least I 
had answers, you know. Bu
t I -- anybody who had 
anything to do with Germans, I stayed rea
lly away, and the -- like you say, I was very 
lonely there, because I couldn™t trust a
nybody I di dn™t know. But there was one girl, and 
she was go -- when we were called out for h
earings, we were scared
 stiff because that 
was life or death again, you know. And it 
all depended on the mood of the guy who 
interrogated you. And we knew it wa
s in a little building, and 
there was one girl, and she 
was called out twice a week at least, and 
mostly around two o™clock in the afternoon, and 
I told you -- this May, June, 
July, August, beautiful day, summer, and she was never 
nervous when she went. And she stayed aw
ake for hours, she came most ly back around 
five. And she had a couple of tan shades da
rker. So I thought, you are not in that little 
building of the hearings. I thought, you are 
a spy, you are planted here. Because I knew 
they had done that in prison, but from her 
I knew it. So I was afraid for the spies, 

[indecipherable] but her, I had already pi
nned down. And another thing happened, and 
that was kind of funny. One time a big filli
ng fell out of my tooth. And you stick all your 
tongue in that when there is
 a hole. And what do you do?  So
 one night one of the girls 
wakes up screaming, screaming. And so we went
 to the guys at the corners, because we 

didn™t know they had -- by that time we were 
there so long they locked us in, and there 
was four guys, and the windows were all ope
n because we -- I think we stunk, because 
we had -- never had soap or shampoo. But anyw
ay, those guys, we were warned, and then 
they [indecipherable] there came an ambulan
ce, and they took her away. And I thought, 
ﬁWhat happens now to her when she is,ﬂ --  I thought [i ndecipherable] kill her, or what 

And they said, ﬁNo, there is a hospital here.ﬂ
 And that™s all prisoners, the doctors, the 
nurses, [indecipherable] everybody is a prison
er except the leaders 
are Germans. And I 
said, ﬁIs there also a de ntist?ﬂ They sa id, ﬁY
eah, there™s also a dentist.ﬂ And by that time 
we had all had our prison dresses, and if 
you had had a hearing it was navy blue, gray, 

navy blue, gray, and it had pockets. And 
if you had had your hearing, then you were 
classified, and you got a triangle, and you pr
obably know about that, but when you were 
a political prisoner you got a red triangle
. If you were a murderer you had a green 
triangle, if you were gay you had a pink tria
ngle, and I think the Jehovah Witnesses had 
silver, gray, or some thing. But that was af
ter your hearing. And Corrie and Betsie had 
already been called out. And so I heard that 
there was a dentist, and I asked permission -- 
a boring life, you know, every day the same , a
nd we were hardly ever ma rching, because 
we weren™t allowed to go outside. And so th
en I said, ﬁCould I go to the dentist? ﬂ And 
with eight other prisoners, we were brought
 by a soldier with a machine gun to the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
83 
 
 
dentist. So we walked through that camp, and it 
was in a little building that was -- I think 
next to the hospital, but I didn™t know, we 
came through a door. And we had eight of us 
to sit on a bench, and I saw that the dentist 
had a green triangle, and he was a Greek, but 
he spoke fluent English. And he -- and he had 
a green triangle, so he was a murderer, but 
I thought, well, maybe he has killed a Germa
n, a nd then you know, for me he is a good 
mur-murderer, yeah. It™s terrible that I 
say that, but you know, you didn™t know what -- so 
anyway, it was my turn, and I -- but this city 
where this Camp Vught was so close to the 
Philips factor ies, and all the young men had b
een sent to Germany, and t he top guys, who 
were necessa ry, they had been exemptioned 
to go to Germany. But they said to the 
Germans, we need Dutch people -- we need pe
ople to work here, we need laborers to do 
the work, why don™t you send some  busloads of 
those prisoners every day?  And then they 
were fed terrific by those Dutch guys, and Philip
s ma kes radios, there was no TV yet, so 
the Germans couldn™t constantly watch, so thos
e prisoners who worked
 there, they loved 
it, they got food fro m the Dutch, and if any of the German was gone, they put the BBC 

on, so they heard all the latest news. And they
 told it in the camps, so that dentist knew 
all the latest news. So it was my turn, and 
he starts drilling, and he said, ﬁWould you like 
to know the latest news?ﬂ I sai
d, ﬁYes, please.ﬂ So he told me  they were ma rching up at 
Italy, and it was going so good for us, so th
ere was hope, you know. And then when my 
turn was over -- he di d the temporarily filling in
 it, so I had to sit back on that bench, and 
the next one -- but that German had to watch us
, but also the dentist and the patient, so he 
was slowly walking up and down, and up and dow
n. And I was sitting at the corner, and 
here was a door. And the door started slammi ng. 
And that™s such an irritating noise, so I 
closed it [indecipherable] and a mo ment la
ter it wa s slammi ng again, and I thought, that 
is not coincident, so I kept my eye on it,
 and when the German had gone this, and was 
with his back to door -- the door opens a little slight, and a ha
nd came up, so high piled 
with bread, much nicer bread th
an we had outside. And was ma rgarine on it. So I grabbed 
it, but the Ge rman could come  back, so what
 do you do?  I gave all the girls one, and was 
no time to eat, so it goes here, that™s wher
e you stuff everything. And then the German 
walked again, and the hand came again, and we
 went in [indecipherable] and we went 
back to the barrack [indecipherable] dow
n, and it was really funny. And we knew the 
news. So the next time  -- the temporary, he did 
that three or four times, and then he said, 
ﬁNow I have to put a real one in.ﬂ And 
I was so sorry, I thought no news, no bread, 
because we shared it with those eight girls,
 especially w-we thought were going to die. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: And I was so sad, and he says to me , ﬁBut
 I can drill a hole in a good one,ﬂ and he said, 
ﬁI won™t touch a nerve.ﬂ I said, ﬁYes, please.
ﬂ And he did several of my good ones, and I 
was there for weeks. And you won™t believe this 
-- so then in the end, I think that he wa s 
-- and we heard heavy artillery in the distan
ce, and that was your general -- we didn™t 
know it was, but we knew they were our friends
 the liberators. And 
the Nazis got terrible 
nervous, and these were our fr
iends, and they didn™t want anybody of this camp ever to 
be liberated. And then they started, every suns
et my barrack was right
 on the edge of the 
camp, and there was water, and they said th
ere wa s electricity so you can™t escape, and 
they said there is a mi ne field. And then you 
had that fence with the towers and ma chine 
guns, and then there were the woods. And the 
ma chine guns were every time  at sunset, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
84 
 
 
and it was in the woods clos
e by that we could hear it. And one day I™m doing the 
laundry, and there were two clothes -- and all 
clothes, and it was 
covered with blood. And 
one woman from the guards -- I remember it, 
you were never alone, a
nd you longed to be 
alone for a mome nt, and think 
and pray. And I had to clean 
the little room where the 
guards were always sitting, 
and there was a [indecipherable] and I was very softly 
humming a -- a hymn that was really consoli
ng to me , and this woma n ca me in. And she 
could have ye lled at me , because you weren™
t allowed to sing. And she said to me, and 
that™s German again, I ha ve to
 spell it, ﬁSie singen wie ei
n Heidelarche.ﬂ You sing like a 
heather lark. And I was really sad, and I didn™t have a beautiful voice, but I knew that she 
was not the cruelest, you know, she had some  
soft . And she was just on duty, so -- and 
she could speak a little bit Dutch, they all coul
d. So I said to her, ﬁWhat is this, all this 
blood? ﬂ  And you know, I had to soak it, and bl
ood has to go in cold water, in troughs 
where we had to wash ourself. And it was ho
rrible. And she said, ﬁ[indecipherable] two 
guys who have been on a motorbike, they had 
an accident , in the hospital, and they come 
out and need their clothes,ﬂ so I washed th
em. Two days later, I got 12 sets of bloody 
underwear and clothes. And that whole 12 wa
s filled with blood, and all the 12, and I 
thought this is not just something. So I went to
 that spy, and they all di d kind of pitiful to 
me , they thought you™re a border case, you™re no
t all [indecipherable], and they said -- 
Hanny Janssen was her name . I said, ﬁHanny, I ha
ve to wash all clothes, you know, that -
- that™s hard to do every day, but now it™s a
ll bloody. What would that be?ﬂ I did real 
stupid. She said, ﬁOh, that are guys who are,
 every sunset when you hear the ma chine 
guys, are executed. They are traitors.ﬂ And it were our Dutch guys. And you know, they 

dragged you from one camp to another. 
And the next day I got 36 of those bloody 
clothes, and that trough was 
filled with Dutch blood. It was so horribl e. And I didn™t 
know if Hein had been brought [indecipherable]
 Ab and I started to
 look always when I 
had to wash those clothes, for name s. 
And I was shattered, an
d I don™t know, I -- I 
cracked up, because also we had buried weapons
 in my parents house, under the roses, 
under the bushes, and I didn™t know anything. I 
thought, if they all the time come  and 
search, and they dig up the yard, and they fi
nd the weapons, they™ve shot my parents. I 
really -- I thought my -- I thought I was abso
lutely going crazy, I didn™t know any more. 

And if I didn™t have my faith, I would have
 -- I was -- I cracked up. I was -- the next 
morning I couldn™t get up, I was paralyzed for 
three days. And they sent the camp doc tor, 
and he kicked the bed, he said, ﬁThere™s not
hing wrong with you.ﬂ But I was so weak that 

then they don™t me  -- me  -- they didn™t ma ke
 me  do the laundry any more, they gave me  a 
broomstick, and I had to sweep. And then I 
started hating them so much, you know. We 
say I hate this, or I thi -- 
old President Bush hated bro
ccoli. And I think you don™t know 
what hated is. With every molecule in my
 body, hated those Nazis for what they were 
doing. And I was so angry with God. I thought, 
you are there in h
eaven, these are your 
people that they™re killing. 
They™re killing my pe ople, 
and you can stop this, and you 
don™t do a thing. And I was praying God™s 
damnation on the whole bunch. I was still 
praying, but I was praying horrible prayers,
 only God™s damn ation. God [indecipherable] 
this or that. And just then, th
ere was one girl that I -- I said
 I trusted too, apart from M r s. 
Verschoor, and her name  was Freddy, and Freddy
 was a Catholic. And just in all this 
stuff that you heard, that was your GeneralPatton, who was getting 
closer, and closer by 
-- and just in [indecipherable] 
of my hearing, and I had -- al
l those months  I had trouble 
with you ma y not give false witness, it was one
 of the things what 
was in the Bible, a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481

story of a spy, Rayhab, and she lied, andshe was not punished by God, but she was 
blessed [indecipherable] Jesus. So when I t
hought of that, because I knew the Bible from 
that -- I thought, oh that™s God permi ssion, so 
I said, oh let -- okay lor
d, I consider that I 
have your permission to lie, and now give me
 a good story. And for mo nths I was praying 
if they had interrogated me  then, I wouldn™t know what to say. But every day I™d work on 

that story when I went to bed. And I was 
born -- I thought, as little ballast as you can 
have. So you have a father, no he has died. Yo
u have a mother?  She has died. No brothers 
and sisters. Because if you -- three months later, I didn™t kn
ow how long I would have to 
say it, you have to tell the story exactly the sa
me , the same  dates. So it was really a ma tter 
of life and death. And just when this all 
happened, I had my story ready, but I was 
repeating it every night, you know, because 
some times they shook you up at two in the 
night, and you had the hearing 
that -- in your sleep, or half asleep you ma y say the wr ong 
thing. And Freddy saw that I was called out fo
r my hearing, and she knew that was life or 
death for everybody, except for this Hanny Jans
sen, and the officer from the Gestapo 
came for the hearing, had to sign me  out. And 
she pretended that sh
e had diarrhea, and 
she stormed from her twine making, past 
me , and while he was signing me  out she 
whispered in my ear. I™m going to storm th
e gates of heaven for you. And you know, me  
-- I say to friends, I™ll pray for you, but this
 was so much stronger, I don™t know if you 
know that story -- the gay gua
rd at -- that comi c, you know, you see him with a ram 
going. And you know some thing, another second 
mi racle happened apart from the rain 
coat. I walked out with that ma n, and we ha
d to walk maybe eight mi nutes, or 10 mi nutes 
to the ma in building of the hearings. And b
ecause I knew the Bible, and I was bombarded 
with God™s promises. And one of them is, not
 a har -- ha ir of your head will be harmed 
without the will of your heavenly father. So th
ey couldn™t even touch a hair of my head 
without Him. And the second one is some thi
ng that you don™t need every time, but it said 
also, do not fear be -- if you have to appear 
before authorities and kings, I will give  you 
the words. God promised me . And I said, okay 
Lord -- like Tevye on this ﬁFiddler on the 
Roof,ﬂ you know, he was always talking to 
God, I said, ﬁI have broken many promises, 
but this is a promise, and I hold you to your
 word. But you just have to give me  the 
words.ﬂ And I walked in that building, and in
 that room, and there 
were a whole bunch of 
Nazi -- very high Nazis sitting 
behind the table, S.S.™s. I kne
w their ranks, and I saw their 
me dals. I think about seven at a green table. And I told you about the bad food we had, 

one slice of bread in the morning, one in th
e evening, and that was 
[indecipherable], then 
the line leaves. But once a month we  got a package from the Red Cross, and that has a 

sandwich, and that had a little bi
t of toilet paper, and it had 
a square inch of pure lard. 
And they had put some  soy sauce in, so we sc
rape every day a bit of that. But because of 
that bad food, we had all gotten phlegm
ones, I don™t know if you know what that -- 
people in the fi rst World War in the ditches in
 Be lgium and France had it. It started as an 
itch, and then you got hives, and then they became  so big like strawberries, and you 

always had them in your face. And your whole face was out of shape, and in the end your 

skin couldn™t hold it any more, and it bur
st open, and green pus was dripping down. And 
we all had that on our faces, most of us, a
nd it was terr ible. And then it was the fi ft h 
month, I™ve never had shampoo, so c a n you imagin
e your hair greasy, ju
st cold water, no 
towels. And we looked a me ss, and we have no 
mirrors, but you saw how the others -- so 

there I was sitting with thos
e seven well fed guys across from me , and 15 mi nutes before, 
I™d wished them all death. And I looked at 
them, and I thought, there you sit, you seven, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
86 
 
 
and you think that you can decide about my life.
 You can™t even touch a hair of my head 
if God doesn™t let you. And I thought you totall
y on the wrong side, the -- and actually, 
the most strange thing, I could 
feel pity for them. They though
t they had it all, and they 
had nothing. And then they ask -- started aski
ng me  questions, but stup
id really had done 
so stupid in those months, and I™d never said 
one gerd of German, one word. So I said, ﬁI 
don™t know what you™re saying.ﬂ So they called 
the translator, and he had to sit there, 
then they asked him the questions, but I knew it  already, and then me , so it gave me  twice 
the time  to think. And then in the end, the lead
er -- he had the highest rank, and he was in 
his 50™s, and he said, ﬁI have done nothing in
 my life but hearings, and I have developed 

a sixth sense,ﬂ he says, ﬁand I can™t,ﬂ -- a
nd I was so afraid that I had slipped up 
some where, you know, because it was very importa
nt. But he said, ﬁI can™t put a pi n in 
your story, [i ndecipherable],ﬂ -- 
he said, ﬁbut my sixth sens
e tells me it™s all baloney.ﬂ 
And I told hi m, because they said I was early 20
, so my father must have been in his 40™s. 
And they said, ﬁ What did your father there?
ﬂ I thought everywhere before I thought a -- 
taxes. I said, ﬁHe worked for the taxes,ﬂ b
ecause that™s everywhere, in every country, you 
know. And then he said, ﬁ Where is he?ﬂ I said 
he died, but of course he must have been 
young. He said, ﬁWhat did he die of?ﬂ I said he
 was bitten by a snake. [indecipherable]. 
And then they asked me  the date, and they have the big Sint er Klass on December five, 

so my father had died on December five. A
nd then, and your mother?  She has died, too. I 
-- I felt like I was killing my own parents. 
And they said, ﬁWhat di
d she di e of?ﬂ I said, 
ﬁShe had a very weak heart, and when Fa
ther was brought home  there, she died.ﬂ 

ﬁ When? ﬂ ﬁ10 days later, 15
th
,ﬂ so I thought I could reme mb
er that. So they asked all 
questions, but then in the end they starte
d -- and I heard every 
word, they started 
discussing my case in front of them. And they
 said, ﬁBut she doesn™t look like a ma id, she 
looks more like a secretary, or a teacher.ﬂ And then I heard another one say, ﬁWell, we 

can check that.ﬂ And I thought, 
how can you ever check -- I -- I had no idea what it was. 
And then they brought me  -- see, that was th
e good thing, that I --
 that they thought I 
didn™t know German. And then 
they brought me  a ma gazine 
and a pad, and a pencil, and 
said, ﬁCopy that.ﬂ And I thought 
-- I think your brains work 200 percent when you™re -- it 
was life or death again. And I thought, why are 
they with this?  And then it dawned on 
me , when you were a maid, by law you had to 
go through sixth grade, and then you could 
go, and mostly you were from poor families, a
nd you were farmed out to a wealthy lady 
where -- or couple, that you had to have the 
etic -- but you don™t writ
e, you write -- and 
we had one hour, and some  schools two hour
s of penmanship. And if you see those 

classr ooms, the capital A, the small a, the 
ca -- so that is what your handwriting was 
when you leave. But if you™re a secretary, 
and you take dictation, you start -- so I 
thought, that is the trap they put up for me . 
So I s a t there, and I hold [indecipherable] 
with my tongue sticking out like it was rea
lly unusual work. And then they brought me  
back to the barrack. And then 
the noise of the a-allies came sh
 -- all the time  closer, and 
they got more and more nervous. And then I remembered one of the wome n one ti me 

says to me  -- I was called Willie. ﬁWillie, if you can choose what day you go out of 

prison, what would you choose? ﬂ And I says, ﬁ
If I would choose, I want to go in the 
radiant sunshine, when the world looks so 
happy.ﬂ I said, ﬁOn a Sa
turday morning, and 
take a soak bath, and shampoo, and take ca
re of all that stuff on my face, clean 
underwear, clean clothes, and Sunday go to c
hurch and thank God for fre e dom,ﬂ I said, 

ﬁwith capital letters. We always take it for grante
d, but it™s a gift.ﬂ I sa
id, ﬁBut if it pours, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
87 
 
 
and it™s Monday morning, I™ll go too.ﬂ And 
you know, this is so mi raculous, two weeks 
later, on a radiant Saturday morning, I wa
s called out by the Ha uptmacht meisterin, she 
was the highest, and she was a real m
ean woma n. And she™s, ﬁWillie, you™ll go to 
Germany.ﬂ And the little voice here said, ﬁY
ou™re going home.ﬂ And that™s when I put 
the belt on, and I left sweaters I had with th
e eight girls, and I knew in my heart I was 
going out. And I was let out with another girl, 
Ansje. And Ansje didn
™t know it, but her 
husband had been executed. And Ansje, when
 we had to stand at attention, you know, 
had always fainted the first. And she was ma rried
 for eight or nine years, and they wanted 
so much to have a baby, and in the camp sh
e found out she was pregnant, so she fainted 
all the time . And her husband didn™t know it, 
but he had been executed. But when she 
was let out she didn™t know she was a widow. A
nd they let us out at the total di fferent 
gate than where they had brought us in. And 
there we stood. And they had been so cruel 
with ma ny things. They once said to me  that
 I could take a shower in Scheveningen, and 
then I was there, and I hadn™t had any water -- 
I mean, that little pail 
with cold water, and 
when I stood there, and I™d 
undressed, and I wanted to [indecipherable] ready, I™d never 
[indecipherable]. So they did all cruel th
ings to ma ke you happy for some thing, and 
they™d --  so we were afraid that  the ga
tes would open again and say, ﬁOkay, all a big 
mi stake, back in.ﬂ And we wanted to get aw
ay, but we were so [i
ndecipherable] nervous. 
And there was nothing. It was a lot of sand, it 
was very arid, and in the distance were 
trees but you saw two wheels from a cart, a
nd you saw some  horse ma nure. And this was 
the end of ™44, and [indecipherable] our 
whole country does nothing any more. If you 
saw a store, there wouldn™t 
be a rubber band, there woul
dn™t be a paper clip, there 
wouldn™t be anything. And the farme r s didn™t get 
fertilizer, and this is an arid part, so 
they collected all the ma nure from their pigs
, their chickens, their cows, from everything, 
and it went in a pit, and then they pumped
 it up, and they put it in the mo ving cart, and 
spread it over the field, and they did that regula
rly. So they never scrubbed that cart wi  -- 
for a few da ys later they filled it again. But this wa s the end of ™44, so you can -- and we 
saw -- where we were standing there, and we said, shall we go left or right, we want to 

get away from here, but we didn™t wa nt 
to walk miles for nothing, you know, so we -- 
and then we saw a little dot. We  said, ﬁLet™s 
see what that is.ﬂ So we started walking, and 
it was a farmer who was going to spread all th
at manure, and that cart was filled to the 
brim with you know what, and stinking, and he 
was walking next to it because there was 
a shelf or some thing, that -- where you coul
d sit on behind the horse
, but it was caked on 
everywhere. And he was walking next to his ho
rse. And he™s, ﬁHi girls, you just came  out 
of the camp? ﬂ And we said yes. And he didn™t know if he should offer us a ride because 

then we had to sit on that dried stuff.
 And he said, would you -- would you -- but 
[indecipherable] it was a Cadillac, and we sa
id, ﬁYes, please.ﬂ He said, ﬁHop on.ﬂ And I 
think that wa s such a glorious exit out of 
that prison, and the concentration camp, on t he 
top of a ma nure cart. And I 
think like [indecipherable] God 
in heaven was having a little 
fun, that he had [indecipherable] 
 

Q: Now, now, l e t me  go back a little bit. What
 was it about this Cat
holic woman saying that 
she would storm the gates of heaven for 
you that brought you out of your anger against 
God?  What do you think -- 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
88 
 
 
A: I -- I really don™t know
 it, but I think she ma de me thi
nk that she was praying for me , and 
that I then thought hatred is 
not really good. It -- you know, 
I -- to be honest, I hated now 
the German again, and I had the same problem
, it took me  mo nths and mo nths. But if you 
start hating some body, it eats you. Then you have 
to, but you need very much strength 
and prayer to overcome that because you know, and I think that she really shocked me in 
that I thought she is praying for me , and that 
I then thought of all God™s promises. I mean 
-- and He keeps His promises, I break them often, by not even th -- 
 

Q: But you were sure, in spite of the fact th
at you were accusing God of not doing anythi ng, 
because all these horrible things were happeni
ng, and that was true, and on the other ha nd 
you believed God would protect 
you. Did you -- do you think -- 
 

A: Well, protect -- I -- I knew -- s
ee, after the war, there were th
ings that -- I had a long time  
a lot of trouble, because more 
than ha lf of our friends were killed. And then I heard that 
there was a session of grief, you know? 
 

Q: Yes. 

 

A: And that were so ma ny steps, and that ma n 
who l e d it, he was a psychologist or whatever, 
and he said, if you mi ss one of those steps, 
you cannot be whole. And as a ma tter of fact, 

then I he -- what he said, I mi ssed the ange
r against God for -- for my life, because I 
thought, God didn™t force us, we did it out of our
 own free will. So that part I can™ t be 
angry with God, because, you know, if we ha
dn™t done it, this mi ghtn™t have happened. 
 

Q: Right. 

 
A: But I don™t know. I mean, I think God works in y
our heart, and that he showed that to me , 
I don™t know. 
 
Q: Were you ever beaten at Vught? 

 

A: Everwhat? 

 

Q: Beaten. 

 

A: No, not beaten. 

 

Q: Uh-huh, you were not. Do any of the wome n that you were with -- 

 

A: There were a couple of Jewish
 sisters, they were taken out 
and they were beaten, and one 
they told me  was put in a very hot bath, and 
then a very cold bath, and the other one came  
back totally deaf, they ha d beaten her with 
the leg of a table, and her drums were broken, 
and so -- but then, the Jewish people went ri
ght away to We sterbork, and then no one saw 

-- but -- 
 

Q: So these Jewish wome n were with you, or
 they were in another part of the -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
89 
 
 
 
A: No, they were in my barrack for a few days. 

 

Q: In your barrack, I see. And was the ma jority 
of people in Vught Jewish, and then the rest 
of you were political prisoners? 
 

A: No. 

 

Q: No. 

 

A: We were nearly all po -- political. 

 

Q: Isee. 

 

A: The Jewish people were right 
away sent to -- the majority in
 our -- were resistance, really. 
 

Q: So that -- you™re talking about the ma jor
ity who stayed there for 
longer periods of time. 
But the Jews who ca me  in when they [indecipherable] 
 

A: They were regularly -- 

 

Q: Isee. 

 

A: -- shippe d -- 

 

Q: Right. 
 
A: -- to We sterbork. 

 

Q: I want -- 

 

A: They didn™t stay there long. 

 

Q: Oh, okay, we™ll change the tape right
 now, because I have another question. 
 

End of Tape #8

Tape #9 
 
Q: Diet, y-you and the -- some  of the othe
r wome n embroidered handkerchiefs. Could you 
show this and explain what it is? 
 

A: Now, when your -- when you left your house in
 the time, there were no tissues. The last 
thing your Mom always yelled when 
you were at the door, do you have your 
handkerchi ef, because it™s terribl e. And when 
I was arrested I had my handkerchief. And 
then when I was in Vught, some body had the ne
edle, and they got the idea, and I did it 

too then, and we could borrow and from each ot
her clot hes we took threads, so we -- you 
just pulled it out. And so here I embr oidere
d -- and every night you could have the needle 
for about seven mi nutes, and then [indeciphera
ble] your blanket, so that you did. And 
here I did the date that I wa
s arrested, and then here it 
must have been from some body 
stuck in Scheveningen, that was the prison. 
And then this was -- 
if you looked up -- high 

up, there was this window, and I was there 
in the A corridor, cell 
306. And this was the 
cribbiltong, where you had to go in your bath
room. And this was quarter to six every 
morning. And then they wanted to call Du
tch, but they said, allemaal upschtaan, 
everybody gets up. And then I was brought -- the 
night of the invasion, June six, we were 
brought to that concentration camp fer. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: And there was -- I was in barrack four, 
and that was here, where you walked, you saw 
this big wall, and here the four
. And there we were in rows of cots, me tal cots, with, you -
- long rows, three high, and I was in ba -- cot 
thr -- 125 in the mi ddle. And then here, we 
got once a month the package of
 the Red Cross, so I did long live the Red Cross. And 
here we ma de our own camp song, Wijlaten demoedniet zakken. And at this -- we don™t 

let our courage go, we keep our heads up, even if they have us now, keep courage, Dutch 

wome n, keep courage, Dutch 
women. And we ma de our own 
me lody, so we sang that all 
the time .  
 

Q: Can you sing that song? 

 

A: I have a terrible 
voice [indecipherable] 
 

Q: It doesn™t ma tter [indecipherable]. Do 
you have any recol -- you have a rec -- you 
r e me mb e r  w h a t  it  w a s?  
 

A: Yeah, I remember the melody, I still -- when
 I saw Corrie ten Boom, or if I see anybody 
who has been, we some time s sing it. [Ms. Eman s i ngs some  lines in Dutch]. Keep 

courage, even if you feel [indecipherable] a
nd here™s [speaks Dutch] that™s to God, and 
here I have a big question mark, will I get ou
t, and if so when. And here I embroidered 
the two initials of my false name
, Wi llie Laarma n. And that™s it. 
 

Q: Well, would you just hold it up for a mome
nt like that?  Yes. It™s wonderful. And you 
took that with you when you left Vught? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
91 
 
 
 
A: Yeah, I me a n, it was to blow your nose in -- 

 

Q: Right. 

 

A: -- so they wouldn™t have taken it, I mi ght 
have [indecipherable] a big blow. No, they -- 
they didn™t take that. 
 

Q: Did you wash this after the war? 

 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: Yes. 

 

A: And then I didn™t use it any more. 

 

Q: Right. 

 

A: But it™s now -- see, here was the needle, and it was there for months, because it took 
every day a few letters, so -- and I think that
 rusted, it mi ght have been a rusty needle. 

And here it™s going a little bit [indecipherable] 
 

Q: Interesting. And then I have some thi
ng else that you shoul
d explain to everybody, 
because before you left -- explain what this is, please. 
 

A: Now, I had to do the laundry, because  that
™s in -- but all the other women had to do 
some thing, and like I say, there was nothing 
any more in the Netherlands, so all those 
other wome n had to sit on long tables, that was 
also the tables where we had to eat, and 
on benches, and they had a rusty cup for them
self, and it was water in it, and they got 
long strips of brown paper, and you 
know, when you go shopping, for food shopping, 
then you get those big brown bags, that type of
 paper. And they got long strips, and they 
have to dump that in the water in strips, a
nd then wind it. And they had every day to do 

60 meters [indecipherabl e] little bit, I think 
70 yards or so. And that was then dried, and 
when it was dry it was rolled in rolls, and they 
sold it as twine. And then I was arrest ed in 

the train, and I had only the one panty on, I had 
no other clothes, so one time the elastic 
off my panty broke, and at th
at time it was -- the elas
tic was like through a loop, you 
know -- now they stitch it on, but 
that wasn™t then. So there I 
was, and I had no panty. So 
I said to the girls who were making that twin
e, ﬁCan you bring me  some  of that? ﬂ  And I 
wind it, and that™s stiff and hard and I can ge
t it through and tie it. So they did, but they 
brought me  so much. But -- and there was nothin
g, so that was very precious, and then I 
had done that with my panty, and I thought wh
at can I do with the rest?  And there were 

eight girls that I thought they 
won™t get out, they won™t surviv
e. They were so sick, and 
TB, and everything. That were also the eight 
that we gave that bread to. And I thought, 
you know what, I™m going to their parents. I had deep down the feeling one day I will -- I 

have those crazy fore-feelings, you know?  And 
I had the feeling, you will get out, you 

will get out. So I asked them where do you liv
e? And I wrote all the eight addresses 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
92 
 
 
down, and their name s. And then I ma de it s
lightly wet, and I w
ound it, but I had so 
much, so I didn™t want to have it just as one
 -- so then, I think w
ithout knowing it, I mi ght 
have done the first macramé. And I made this
 belt, it was in August ™44, I would say. But 
how do you close it?  So then I did those loops, 
and one a bit smaller 
than the other one. 
And out of some body™s socks, we -- I pulled w
ool, and then -- so when I was let out, I 
had this around my waist, and I 
was planning to go to all those 
eight parents, they lived in 
different cities. But I had all the addresses in my
 head, so I never had to open it. So this is 
the real thing. But you know, it™s 
paper, and now it™s getting 
too dry. The other day I wet 
it just  a little bit, but 
it™s breaking here, and I feel so ba
d. But really, I think 60 years later, 
it must have bleached up, but the name s should 
still be in here. But I still know several. 
Randy Polner was one of them. 
 
Q: Did you -- 

 

A: Nora Doma rt, ™32 Amsterdam, and I went th
ere. And a few years a
go, I went back to see 
if her family still lived ther
e, but they didn™t. But there 
was another guy who did TV like 
you do, and they were kind of interested. 
 

Q: So did you go to all of these eight? 

 

A: I went to all those parents,
 and I told where they were, a
nd that we hoped that they ma ke 
it out. But at least you kn
ow some thing then -- 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: -- because see, Corrie ten Boom, Corrie and 
Betsie were -- had th
e hearing, and then you 
went to the other camp, and that was much  easier. We  were not allowed anything. And 

there Corrie and Betsie [indecipherable] so
me  months you were allowed to write, it was 
censored, and then some  mon- months you were allowed to receive ma il. You could 

receive one package a month. And you had a working day, but when it wa s over, you 

were allowed outside in the camps, free to visi
t others, in other barr
acks. Now, we we re 
never -- we were now and then ma rched 
through a little street
, up down, up down, that 
was all -- and then back, because we were 
really the ones who ha
dn™t had a hearing. And 
I did another terrible thing, that Hanny Ja
nssen, the traitor, I 
heard from some body -- 
yeah, I have to tell this too, because it™s re
ally hilarious. I heard that she was really a 
prostitute, and she had started an affair 
with one of those SS™s on the corner, a young, 
handsome guy, Hans. And some body told me , ﬁH
anny climbs out of the barrack late, out 
of window, and then she™s the whole night w
ith this Hans, [indecipherable] and then 

towards the morning she climbs back.ﬂ And then -- and she wa s a prisoner, and we had to 

stand appel. And then they came back, and th
e man in charge of the appel -- you had the 
week that you were the stubealteste, that™s 
the outchder from the -- in time then. So one 
time it was my turn to be stubealteste, and [i
ndecipherable] I have a real mean streak in 
me , and I™ m not sorry for it. And anyway, when 
I heard that, I said to the gi rl who told 

me , I said, I know some thing. So then when it was my turn in the morning to tell the 

guards who locked us up and went away then
 by that time, they weren™t day and night 
with us any more, but the guards were ther
e. And I locked all the windows from the

barrack. And Hanny wanted to climb in in th
e morning, and she couldn™t, there was no 
window open. And then she had to disappear in the woods, because, you know, she 
[indecipherable] mi ssing, but she was a prisoner
. So then -- and they all thought that I 
was so stupid, so then the guards came in and they had to say hundred sev -- 185 

prisoners, eight in bed, and so ma ny. And then 
you had to say who were sick or new sick 

ones. And I said -- and I did real stupid, I 
said, ﬁI know there shoul
d be 175 wome n, but I 
can only count 174, but I™m probably wrong.ﬂ 
But they started counting, and she was 
mi ssing. And then it was daylight, so she c
ouldn™t come  back. And then oh, there was -- 
and she was mi ssing. And then later, the rumo
r went Hanny Janssen had tried to escape, 
but that wasn™t true, and she had to go 
a month to the bunker, so we were a month 
without her, and she never knew who -- but then
 after the war, two guys from the -- from 
the ger -- from our police came when I wa
s studying nursing, and they came  to the 
hospital where I worked, and they were from
 the -- the political police, you know, who 
were checking on all traitors. 
And they said, ﬁYou were in Vught, did you know a girl by 
the name  of Hanny Janssen?ﬂ I said yes. ﬁWha
t did you think of her?ﬂ I said, ﬁI think she 
was a spy.ﬂ ﬁ Why do you think that?ﬂ I said, ﬁB
ecause with -- she 
was called out all the 
time, she was never nervous, she had a tan wh
en she came back. She was very talkative, 
so she had had wine or beer.ﬂ And I said,ﬁI had just drawn my own conclusion.ﬂ And I 

told what I had done. And then they told me  it 
was true. But they told me  that she was in 
Rotterdam a prostitute for the very high Ge
rmans, and they had uniforms, and the top 
officers went to her. And England found that ou
t, and then they asked -- and there were a 
lot of volunteers, and like a s
on of a consul, or an ambassador who grew up in Germany, 
was fluent in German, a nd went to school, 
they probably spoke the dialect. And they 
found one guy who was willing to take a very
 high imitated German uniform, and they 
dropped him off over the Netherlands in the night
, out of the plane, he had to jump. And 
he had to worm his way into her circle of 
friends, and he did. And in the end he became 
engaged to her. But he was very broadminde
d, she could see her other friends, and in bed 
she got so many secrets fr om -- and he asked questions, general, you know. And she 

found it out, and that went all back to Engla
nd, till one day -- it was such a secret that 
they had to narrow it down and 
it pointed to her. But England had more on this guy, so he 
disappeared, her fiancé disappeared. But then 
the Germans were with a terribl e problem, 
was she really pro-German and a victim, what
 she was, or was she planted by England? 
So they didn™t know what to do with her, so
 they put -- I don™t know if they asked me  to, 
so I think that she -- 
 

Q: They imprisoned her? 

 

A: Pardonme ?  

 

Q: Did they put her in prison? 

 

A: They arrested her -- 

 

Q: They did arrest her. 

 

A: -- and I think that sh
e had a long prison term.

Q: Where did you -- when you left -- 

 

A: Thecamp? 

 

Q: Yes, in this ma nure truck, where did you go? 

 

A: I went -- first of all to Th
e Hague, and I went to close frie
nds of my parents, we played 
bridge or some thing once a week. And I wanted 
to know if they were still alive. But they 

lived far away from whe r e my parents, qu
ite a distance. And I thought, you know, that 
my parents -- they were so wise, beca
use so ma ny people in the underground were 
arrested, that a friend saw them and said I™ve
 seen so and so, and that week -- and then 
the person wa s arrested. Because friends who 
thought it was interesting to say when they 

were looking for you, I™ve seen them. And I 
rang the bell there, and I thought they say, 
ﬁHi Diet, there you are, and your parents don™
t know.ﬂ Because I had disappeared, they 
never got those notes any more. And they s --
 ﬁHi, I am here.ﬂ And nothing exciting. And 
I said, ﬁHow are father and mother? ﬂ They 
said fine. And then I said, ﬁ come  out of 
Vught.ﬂ My parents had given 
the story that I was -- I had my wedding license, and my -- 
and I didn™t know how to boil a 
potato, and Hein had 10 kids 
there in that fa mily. My 
parents had all the time said when there is 
-- where is Diet, where is Diet, she -- ﬁOh, she 
doesn™t know anything about the household and 
she™s learning it at Hein™s parents that 
she knows the household. So they did not know it. And then I told them, a nd they went to 

my parent™s house. And then I did the danger
ous thing. We  lived very close to a corner, 
but in our street were a few Nazis. And I sa
id, ﬁOh, I want to see my parents.ﬂ You know, 

I really thought they mi ght have been shot
, so I wa nted to see them. [indec i pherable], 
ﬁCan you go to our parent™s house, and tell th
em to leave the door open, and then I go on 
the corner, and I look. If nobody is
 there, and I shoot in th
e house.ﬂ And that™s what 
happened. And then Mom was so happy, because they had really thought I was dead, they 
hadn™t heard. And when -- she was helping, 
I told you, the baker and the milkma n ca me  
to the house always, and she was just helpi
ng the milkman, and then my fa ther came  
home , but she didn™t want to say Diet is home, you know, because that wa s dangerous. So 

my father walks in, and I had -- we had kind of
 a long house at that time, so I had -- when 
the doorbell rang, I had gone to 
the back, because then if there was danger, I would climb 
over the wall from the rosebushes, and in an
 alley disappear. So I was in the back. And 
then my father came to the back, and he sees me , and he turns around, and walks in a side 

room. And oh, he is furious at me  that I cau
sed him so much trouble. So I followed him, 

and that was the first time in my life I saw him crying. And he was so happy. So then I 

stayed only till it was dark, and then I le
ft, and found the underground. And then I went 
to all the guys, to Aalt and Alie, and Ab had b
een arrested. No, Ab at that time  hadn™t yet 
been arrested, the other leader. And I went also
 to my sister and her 
husband. So I went to 
all, and then they said we need you, so ma ny 
have been a -- arrested. And then a guy, this 
[indecipherable] troop was also helping, because
 so many were arrested. And that -- tho -
- they were more in, really, you know, muniti
on things and so. And one of them, a spy 
had to go all the time  on dangerous mi ssions. A
nd it was -- we had -- he has false papers. 
But it was safer if he had a woma n with him, 
so we had false papers that I was his wife, 
and then he prin -- it tell you 
that we were daily laborers, 
and helping with far ms. So I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
95 
 
 
went ma ny t i me s with him over the rivers, a
nd through territory wher
e you really weren™t 
allowed, but that we say we have to work fo
r that farmer, and showed our false papers, 
and so -- and then he was real
ly in spying, so he asked. ﬁCan you work for us while you 
walk from The Hague to Amster-Amsterdam
? ﬂ  I saw troop moveme nts and everything, 
and where they are building fort and quarters, a
nd so then that™s that 
stuff that they gave 
me for instructions, and I did 
that till the end of the war. 
 

Q: And who wa s taking care of all th
e Jews who were still in hiding? 

 

A: I did too, in between. 

 

Q: You did that also? 

 

A: Because he had often to go to other pa rts 
of the Ne therlands, but if he needed some body, 
I went with him, but I went full time , like [indecipherable] 
 

Q: And it was December of ™44 that Ab was arrested? 

 

A: Ab was in December because -- 

 

Q: Yes. 

 

A: -- that  family where they had the pilots, th
at had leaked out, and 
he got a me ssage from 
the good police -- there were -- there were 
bad police and good poli
ce, you -- your house 
will be raided, they suspect you. So he disappe
ared -- he di sappeared and went in hiding. 
And Ab was  arrested, that Ab also had hear
d the other leader that
 they were going to 
arrest him, because you™ve got mostly warn
ed by the good police, and he went to warn 
him. But the guy, Dries Klooster had already 
disappeared and gone in hiding. And just 
when Ab wa s there to warn Dries, 
the police came, and he was arrest ed. 
 

Q: He was arrested, so bot
h of them were arrested. 
 

A: And he never came back. 

 

Q: Uh-huh. 

 

A: And the sad case was with Klooster, and th
at was another question ma rk to God. I me an, 
he was hiding at the farm, in the little vill
age, it™s really a -- 
a settlement, was called 
[indecipherable] one, two, three. And when the a
llies came, and that were in this case the 
Canadians, they came fr om the east, after the 
battle of Ironham, and the whole thing, and 

then they were ma rching up. And they wanted to cut off the Germans, and they ma rched 

up, and then they were really sh
elling. When they want to advan
ce, they shell, so we said 
three days and was shell fire in the -- I was 
with Aalt and Alie at that farm, and Dries was 
not too far, ma ybe a fe w kilome ters, but th
e shells were falling everywhere. And one 
shell hit that farm. 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
96 
 
 
Q: Right. 
 

A: And he was killed. And I was liberated on H
itler™s birthday by the Canadians, so I got the 
biggest present. 
 

Q: April20
th
, 1945. 
 

A: April 20. And the rest of the country was la
ter, but we were really by fighting. When I 
came out after three day, you -- you thought day 
and night you heard the shells fall, and 
that was so horrible, boom, boom, boom
, and you didn™t know if it would be on your 
roof, and that it would hit you. And we don™t have big baseme nts because we are such a 

water country, if you go a bit deep
er, you™re in the water. So we
 sat there, and then after 
three days and three nights it was quiet, and 
that was even spookier than when it got all 
absolute quiet. And you know, like Noah, that 
we let a dove out to see, and some body 
had to go out, what happened. And the Jewish
 people couldn™t go, and the far mer and his 
wife and two little babies, and she was pregna
nt, she couldn™t go, and the -- so I felt I was 
the one who had to go, and I came out, and on th
e road in the distance, I saw all tanks, 
and that were the allies, the Canadians. O
h, and it -- and I ran towards them, but then I 
thought, no, that is selfish, I have
 to go back to the farm, the Jews had been all the time, 
years in that little room that they can -- and 
I turn around, and we have so much water, so 
there was kind of a small river, and it had al
l those weeping willows. And I had heard that 
in Italy more allies di ed by snipers than really
 in battle. And when I ran back to the farm, 
I see three Germans in camouflage in the wate
r, and there™s no -- their daggers between 
their teeth, and their guns up, and they were
 walking away from the allies, under the 
weeping willows. And they saw that I had seen them, and I thought, oh my goodness, 

they are not planning to surre
nder, otherwise they would ha
ve gone the other way. So I 
went -- I went back, I thought, now I have to go 
to the allies, but I was afraid that they 
would shoot me  in my back. I zigzagged to 
tho -- to those Canadian tanks and I said, 
ﬁThere are snipers.ﬂ And they turned around, a
nd then they went there, three tanks, and 
each took one of the Germans like -- really li
ke [indecipherabl e], and then I said there 

they are. And I said that™s when
 I won the war, I was triumphant. 
 

Q: Now tell me  some thing, did any of the Je
ws that you -- your group 
was hiding, did any of 
them get caught?  Nobody got caught? 
 

A: From our original group, never. The gr
oup from Mies that we  helped, yes.  
 

Q: Yes. 

 

A: The whole group. And -- 

 

Q: But not the original group of 60? 

 

A: No, they all got through. Miracle. 

 

Q: Really a mi racle. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
97 
 
 
 
A: But if we knew that a thing was getting 
unsafe, we had -- you know, there was one -- you 
know, Esso, that is that very wealthy oil -- 
a son of them, Hans von Esso, and his sister 
Alie, and I was some where, and this Hans from
 Esso came  to us for an address. And I 
never forget, I was at Yen, that was anothe
r one of our group in The Hague, and he saw 

me , and Yen said she brings all the Jewish 
people to the -- to [ind
ecipherable] to that 
area. And he stuck his hands in his pockets, and he held it out, and it was full with 

diamond and emeralds, and he, ﬁPlease, find me
 a place.ﬂ I said, ﬁYou can put that away, 

that doesn™t do anything. I help 
-- the forest and whatever, if
 we find a place.ﬂ And then -
- but this was so far in the war, I think th
ey had been some where else, where it wasn™t 
safe, and he had real troubl
e finding a place. And then he found some thing, but he asked 
for his sister Alie, she wa s beautiful, a
nd younger than he was. And we found a place at 
this very poor farm, so poor, it was really 
the ma rried daughter of the farmer where we 
had Herman. And she was a sloppy household, 
where they had a bunch of babies. And 
you know she was -- so that was the only place,
 and it was so poor, and she had to sleep 
in the hay. And Rosa was at that time  at an
 address [indecipherable] safe, so Rosa was 
there, too, and Rosa got scabies, you know, th
at™s really from dirt. And Alie got it too. 
And Rosa went to -- back to Arlington wh
en it was safe, and there she was, you know, 
bath and what -- boil the clothes, and so -- 
but Alie couldn™t take it any more because 
Rosa told me later, she said, ﬁThat wi fe of that farmer was so filthy,ﬂ they had on the 

table a piece of oilcloth or some thing, and then
 she said, ﬁthat™s where we had to eat, they 
didn™t have any tablecloth,ﬂ or
 whatever. So -- but she change d the dirty diaper of the 
baby there too, on that table, and some ti me s 
didn™t clean, so it was a filthy house. And 
then Alie, who came from such a wealthy family, and probably had lots of servants, she 

couldn™t hack it any more, and she went back 
into her other [indecipherable] and she was 
arrested, and she was killed. And I think oh, that
 poor Alie, if she 
had only had held out, 
you know. 
 
Q: Right. 

 

A: Because the camps mi ght have been just
 as dirty. Hans came through [indecipherable]. 
No, we were very fortunate. 
 

Q: But you™re not so fortunate personally, because -- 

 

A: I have to look at it this way. We  were four
, really five years in th
is war, and if you think 
that more then two and a half year, every month we had to do those robberies. And they 

were only once [indecipherable] and you always
 prayed beforehand if God would protect 
everybody, also the enemy, where the Dutch pe
ople were [indecipherable] and I think 
God is almi ghty, and Hein was killed in the 
end of January ™45, the war was over. I was 
free in April [indecipherable] I just know
 that God [indecipherable] have protect 
[indecipherable]. So I figured -- and so ma ny 
didn™t come back, and I was spared three 
times that I thought this is the end, when I 
were driven in the dunes, when I had my 
hearing, when I was arrested with all that st
uff. So then, I think God still has some thing 
for me  to do, and I have to find it. And now th
at I look back I see it
, because it™s telling 
the young people in the universities, and you don™
t know a thing here in America. I had 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
98 
 
 
to speak for Yad-Vashem, I got [indecipherable] 
later from - -  and I me t that rabbi, what™s 
his name ?  Mordechai Paldiel,
 have you heard his name ?   
 
Q: Mm-h m.  

 

A: And I mean, he is -- really became a friend 
of mi ne. And then they asked me  to speak for 
Yad-Vashem as a fundraiser, they wa nt to bu
ild the school next to the mu seum, and they 
invited in, I™d learned, a very wealthy [indeci
pherable] a very wealt
hy Jewish people, and 
I had to speak, and then they all got a book, a
nd need to write a fat check, and so on. But 
I mean, I me t them, and I think well, I have a purpose, you know?  And they say, go along 

with -- tell, tell, tell, and that
™s what I do. And they do that now with teachers, that they 
over the whole world ma ke [indecipherable], 
and there was in Canton, in Ohio, there is 
Malone College, that™s a liber
al arts, Malone College, and there™s a large Jewish group, 
and they ask me  -- they started -- I think th
at™s now about eight years ago, in the summe r 
when the college is closed, they have a w
eek long that it™s a whol
e Holocaust week. And 
the rabbis, and the people [indecipherable] they had then one
 survivor of Auschwitz, an 
old ma n, and they had a Jewish lady who was 
hiding, a Polish Jewish lady. They had the 
Polish lady who had taken Jews in, and they wanted me  then to come , and I 

[indecipherable] the whole week, and you know, 
I was really surprised. The first year 
they told me  they had 12 people, and now th
ere were 45, so this was the third year, and 
now I hope it grows. But those teachers, that is good, they go back to their schools and 

talk. Because I -- one lady there, they asked 
-- I mean, she says, ﬁWhen I was in college, 
my prof told me  the Holocaust never happened, 
and it™s a sob story that
 the Jewish people 
do just to get pity.ﬂ So can you imagine that you 
say that to a class of 
students?  So I feel I 
have to go. I have to go and then like I wa
s those 10 years in Venezuela, that was a 
healing time away from everything, no talk
ing about it, nothing. Because when my 
friends from Venezuela, we only 18 Dutch fa
milies, and I knew them all because those 
wome n ma rried mostly, they ha -- they were 
engaged, and then they got this great job 

after the war from Shell, so they quick got ma
rried and they had their first baby their, and 
the doctors only spoke Spanish, and they were 
scared stiff, because [indecipherable] they 
were expecting their first baby, so I was 
called out for every delivery, and they all 
became my friends, and they were like brothers
 and sisters. And I s
till have contact with 
them. But you know, that was such a healing ti
me , and I never talked about the war. And 
then when the book came out later, they sai
d, ﬁWe were 10 years with you, and you never 

said it.ﬂ But I think that was the good thing 
that I was away from all me mories there. 
 

Q: We have to stop the tape. 

 

End of Tape #9 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
99 
 
 
Tape #10 
 
Q: How did you find out about Hein?  I mean -- 

 

A: Well, his father -- of course we weren™t ma
rried, he got a notice from the Red Cross, and 
that notice said that he had died in Dachau
 on March nine. So he let me  know, and I right 
away said, ﬁIf he has died, it was January 20.ﬂ  And the father really got angry with me, 

but that was the night I couldn™t sleep, and that
 I was pacing that big 
room at that farm. 
And I had to sleep in a double bed with a girl 
in her -- a few years older than I was, if I 

slept there. And it was so cold, and there 
was no heating, and she said, ﬁWillie, come in 
in bed, it™s so cold.ﬂ And I said to her, 
ﬁThere is something with Hein,ﬂ it was that 
horribl e feeling again that I go
t. I said, ﬁWhat is today the 
date?ﬂ She said, ﬁJanuary 20.ﬂ 
I said, ﬁWhen he comes back, I™m sure he™s very
, very sick, and that 
I have to ask him if 
he was sick.ﬂ And that was the night he die
d, and I heard that late
r. And the Red Cross 
say nine, but when other people 
were let out, some survivor s and they -- I -- I me -- I met 
them, and they said Hein was taken out of 
the barrack on January 20 in the evening, and 
never came back. But he was very weak, a
nd he had [indecipherable] where you couldn™t 
work any more, so -- 
 

Q: This was your biggest tragedy. Th
is was your biggest tragedy, yeah? 

 

A: It was terrible, and I know that I ma de it 
so di ffi cult for the guy who came to tell me. 
That was the father of one of those guys that
 Henk had me ntioned to me  [indecipherable] 
was arrested, Dekker was his last name , and he
 was in the town hall, or town city, or 
some thing in -- in Ei ndhorf also, and he had to go to The Hague, and Hein™s father wrote 

me  the letter that Hein had died. And I was so 
happy that we were free, and this terrible -- 
and the Jewish people could come  back, but there was also a fear, there we re too ma ny in 

Germany, who come s ba ck, who co -- doesn™t
 come  back. So you were mixed, you didn™t 
dare to be  really happy because you didn™t know
 anything. And then this man ca me back 
and rang the bell, and I opened the door, a
nd I said, ﬁOh, Mr. Dekker,ﬂ and his son had 
come  back, and I said, ﬁHow nice to see you.ﬂ 
I said, ﬁOh how wonderful
 that we are free 
and now waiting for our guys to come back.ﬂ 
And I was so bubbly. And then he said to 
me , ﬁ Yeah, but some  won™t come  back.ﬂ And so he wanted to push me  a bit down, you 

know, and I -- yeah but -- and I was just bubbl
ing, and then I got that letter. It was 
terrible, I don™t know if I --  
 

Q: On the other -- 

 

A: But then -- ve ry -- reme mber very little, I was in a daze. 

 

Q: Yes. On the other hand, you thought 
that that mi ght have happened. 
 

A: I expected -- 

 

Q: A -- on bo -- you expected [indecipherable] some  way. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
100 
 
 
A: [indecipherable] and I nearly -- I don
™t know how well you know the Torah and the 
Bible, but you know, Abraham was asked to s
acrifice Isaac, and I thought maybe this is 
the sacrifice that God asks me , but I know I 
didn™t want to live any more, because then, 
from our group of 15, eight were killed, so more 
than half I thought I di
dn™t want to live 
any more. I said, ﬁLord, why didn™t you take me
 too, I don™t want to live any more.ﬂ But 
then slowly but surely, you -- 
it -- that you have always a ta
sk for you. Oh, it was terrible. 
And then Ab was killed -- 
 
Q: Right. 

 

A: And Hergen Feesler was killed, the ma n 
who took the picture when we are hugging, that 
he wanted to. But Herg was very brave, he -- now allies were comi ng, and the Germans 

had mi ned a bridge, and thought if they come  ove
r, we let it go in the air. And Herg knew 
that, and then the allies were real close, he
 ran through that bridge
, and he cut all the 
wires on the explosion, and he was shot, and 
he also gave his life, he was brave. 
 

Q: Why did you write in your book -- 

 

A: Wr iteit? 

 

Q: -- why did you write in your book that in 
some  way you thought it w -- if one of you had 
to live that -- not that it was better 
that you were the one
 who lived, but -- 
 

A: I would -- 

 

Q: -- you could do it, that 
some how you could do it? 
 

A: I think it was harder to st ay alive. 
I think it would be th
e easier to di e. 
 

Q: Uh-huh. 

 

A: I went through such terrible things, because when I was let out of the camp, I didn™t want 
in any way that they knew I had been in 
prison. And I had smuggled a note out with this 
girl whose husband had been shot, tortured, 
and I had said don™t ask me  any questions, 
but I knew her husband had been executed, so
 she was okay, she was not [indecipherable] 
and she lived in a suburb of The Ha gue. So I 
said, please go to [indecipherable] this note, 
ask anything. If you see that there is Gest
apo around, pretend that you are collecting for 

the winter help, that was from the Germans. I 
said, ﬁBut if you get to see, tell that Willie 
is in Vught, and that they ma y not do anyt
hing to try to get me  out,ﬂ because I was 
creating this image fr om the stupid gi rl -- 
 

Q: Right,right. 

 

A: And I -- and too, the guys, the underground wa
s trying like to [indecipherable] to bribe a 
big -- they were saving thousands of guilders 
to get me  out, right?  
But that would have 
ruined my whole stor y, because --

Q: Right. 

 

A: -- then I was important if they give so 
much mone y. So she did that. Then my parents 
knew where I was. But I -- I told also in th
at me ssage, and let the guys never do -- and let 
Hein not know that I am also in pr ison, b
ecause it was such a torture when some body you 

love dearly -- I think with children, too, 
if your children suffer, you want to suffer 
yourself, but not them. And that™s how I felt 
with Hein, and I thought
, oh, that was one of 
the cruel things that guy did, 
the -- the German. I had told 
him, I™ll bring you everywhere, 
drive me , but there are two places in this worl
d where I never want to go, and that is the 
concentration camp Ame r sfoort, because Hein wa
s terr ible tort ured there. And it™s ri ght 
in the mi ddle where we hid all -- I™ve thousa
nd time s passed it, but I don™t want to go 
there, what for?  To cry?  Then to think of 
all the suffering, and the horror, he was killed. 
And I™ve three times passed the 
road that it says kil --  three kilometers [i ndecipherable] 
and I never go in, I don™t want to. And this guy dr
ove me  the last day he went off th -- he 
went ma ny t i me s off the track, and I 
said you™re going wrong, you™re going wrong. 
[indecipherable] and the last day I couldn™
t -- I was so happy it was over, he was a 
mi serable guy. And then he turns off the roa
d, and he come  in the woods, and I had no 
idea. I said Martin [indeciphera
ble] straight ahead today. A
nd he come  in the woods, and 
he stops at the building, says here we are. I 
had no idea where we were, and the -- then is 
the sound guy and the came rama n were there, and they 
[indecipherable] me  up. And 
Martin starts on the new path, slightly up, a
nd I follow, and I see the sign, the place of 
execution of that horrible camp. Now, is that cruelty? 
 

Q: Soundscruel. 

 
A: Where I told him -- 
 

Q: Not to do it, right. 

 

A: And I was so furious, I said, ﬁWhat a creep you 
are.ﬂ I said, ﬁI told 
you this is the place,ﬂ 
I said, ﬁI™m 82, I can decide.ﬂ And I did not 
-- I said, ﬁI have no words for you.ﬂ And I 
turned around and I walked away. And then
 the sound guy, who had always disconnected 
[indecipherable] an-and the camera man, they said 
that they have left  this on, that the TV 
station knows what he did. 
 

Q: Right. You -- you have Hein™s di
ary. You have loads of letter
s, and there™s one final letter 
that he threw out of the tra -- train, that he threw on th
e ground, and somehow it reached 
you. Can -- can you read that, part of it?  Or
 do you want me  t o read the English? 
 

A: No, I --  

 

Q: You can™t?  Can you read that? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0481  
102 
 
 
A: I can, yeah.ﬂ It is still very unexpected,ﬂ -- 
it™s so small -- ﬁr-reall
y, they didn™t count on 
this any more. I am happy that they have le
ft the camp Amersfoort,ﬂ -- so he must have 
suffered there -- ﬁand yesterdayﬂ -- you see,
 it™s so small and my eyes are -- 
 
Q: Here -- here™s -- here™s from your book, you can read this. 

 

A: Oh that™s better, yeah. 

 

Q: You can read it from the book. 

 

A: ﬁYesterday, about nine in th
e evening we left, and now it™s 
seven in the morning. We  just 
passed Rijssen,ﬂ and that is the last  city in th
e Netherlands. ﬁI think that trip will be quite 

long. Darling, don™t count on seeing each other ag
ain soon. I have the feeling that it will 
take at least a year. But we are with friends
 here altogether, and 
you will soon be in free 
country, so we have ma ny reasons to be optim
istic. And here we see again that we do not 
decide our lives. Dieneke,ﬂ -- that was his ni
ckname for me -- ﬁeven 
if we won™t see each 
other on earth again, we will never be  sorry fo
r what we did, and that we took this stand. 
And know, Diet, that of every last huma n bei
ng in this world, I loved you the most. And 
it™s still my great desire that
 we be -- will become  a happy family some day.ﬂ And then he 

ends with the words, ﬁOmnia vincit amor.ﬂ 
That is Latin for love conquers all. And you 
know, when we got engaged, it was on the tram
 in Amsterdam. We had our rings, and -- 
because we had ordered our rings, and what
 we wanted engr aved. And then he came 
home , there was a ma nila envelope and he 
was on list to go to England, and then he 
found that manila envelope, and he said, ﬁD
iet, these are my in
structions to go to 
England,ﬂ he said, ﬁand I have
 to leave right away,ﬂ and 
it was a Saturday afternoon, we 
had just ordered our rings and 
what we wanted inscribed, an
d he said, ﬁAnd I ma y not tell 
you where I go and what I do, but I go tonight 
to England.ﬂ He said, ﬁDo you reme mb er,ﬂ 
-- I didn™t know Amsterdam [indecipherable]
 he said, ﬁDo you reme mbe r  where we 
ordered the rings? ﬂ  I said [ind
ecipherable]. He said, ﬁGo there, pick them up,ﬂ -- he had 
paid for it and for the engraving, he says -- 
and there was a tramway that go to the ma in 
station, the central station, and 
it was line two. He says -- and the tram mo stly had three 
or two or three carriages, a
nd there was a balcony that wa
s open where you step on, and 
then you went inside. And he said, ﬁHop on the la
st balcony of the last 
car, and then after 
two stops, I™ll hop on too. I have to ta -- get a fe
w things.ﬂ So I ran to 
that store, and I got 
our rings and the guy said, ﬁI haven™t engrav
ed,ﬂ I said, ﬁDoesn™t ma tter.ﬂ So I hopped on 
the tram, on the last cart, and 
two stops later he came, and he gave me  his ring, and I gave 
him my ring, and that was our engageme nt, on th
e back balcony of the -- and then we had 
it engr aved later, it -- he was in
 very big danger, it was a da
ngerous trip, and he never got 
to England. But at that time, in the beginning 
we thought that™s where you can be useful -
- 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: -- but later those people were
 bored stiff, we could do much more. But then we have 
engaged on the [indecipherable] and his name  and the morning, it was another 

premonition, the morning -- the day that I was ar
rested -- I had always that ring on, and I

took it off, and I said to Alie from the farm
, I said, ﬁToday I™m going to be arrested.ﬂ She 
said, ﬁWillie, you are nervous, and,ﬂ -- Hein had 
just been arrested then, maybe. I said, ﬁI 
know I™m ne rvous,ﬂ I said, ﬁbut I have such a 
strong feeling that I™ll 
be arrested today.ﬂ 
And I said, ﬁWill you take this 
ring till after I come back,ﬂ 
because his name  was in the 
ring, and so then they could say it was Hei
n. So I gave her the ring, and it was really 
funny, because I had all white underwear, but 
I had se -- one set black, and I thought 
when you are in prison, and you can™t wash it, and 
it gets dirtier and dirt
ier, it -- I thought 
I™ll put my black one on, it get also dirty, 
but you don™t see it. I put my black underwear 
on, and I knitted [indecipherable] with the cab
le stitch, and I thought that is nice and 
solid, and that™s how I we nt on that trip, and 
on that trip I was arrested. Strange, huh?  I™m 
always scared when I get that feeling. 
 
Q: Uh-huh. Do you ever regret having b
een in that group 
with you all --  
 

A: Oh,no. 

 

Q: -- being in resistance, even
 though you lost Hein?  Never. 
 

A: I tell you, I saw -- I never go to
 war movies, but I saw ﬁSchin
dler™s Listﬂ because I heard 
he changed later. But he started with wanti
ng cheap labor. And I satthere, and I cried the 
whole film, and long times I closed my ey
e [indecipherable] hated Hitler, and the 
swastika, and that wolfs ange
l and those hated uniforms, a
nd all. And I had a horrible 
time, but I wanted to see it, and in the end 
Schindler™s changed because he -- later he™s 
very sorry that he didn™t save more. And when 
I walked out of that theater, the only thing 
I said, ﬁThank you God, I did some thing.ﬂ Beca
use I thought, if now I would have seen 
that movie, I thought you were there. You 
were young, but you were an adult, 20 year a -- 
an adult. And I thought, you were there, a
nd this happened all ar
ound you, and you didn™t 
do anything. I don™t know if I -- 
and that™s what I tell the 
young people, I said, ﬁMake the 
right choices,ﬂ I said, because 
-- and I tell them this, I sai
d, ﬁIf I now -- you can™t go back 
and do it over.ﬂ 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: ﬁYou have at that mo me nt,ﬂ and I said,and that ma  -- ma y [i ndecipherable] during the 
[indecipherable] and I says, ﬁWhatever your
 religion have -- you have, you have 
guidelines.ﬂ I say, ﬁAnd if you don™t have a relig
ion, you have a little voice in your heart, 
and you listen to that.ﬂ It™s the only way 
that you can in the morning when you brush 
your teeth look in the mi rror and not despise 
yourself. No, I never [indecipherable]. And 
to be honest, spiritually it was the closest time  to God, because He was all I had. 
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: Yeah. I think I™ve had a very
 wonderful, rich, life, and not always the things that you 
choose, but I asked for it, I really did. Not a dull life, so -- 
 

Q: Right. We ll, I thank you more than y
ou know for  comi ng and talking with us.

A: It™s good to be here, because you keep 
this for hundred and 200 years later -- 
 

Q: Yes. 

 

A: -- so then people will know
, and it™s good that you have eyewitnesses, because hearsay is 
never the same. 
 

Q: That™s true. Thank you very much. 

 

A: No, I am gla d that I came. Thank you.
