This  photograph of Martin Weis s was  taken in 1946, the year after  his liber ation.
 
 
Marty was  born in the c ountry of Czec hos lovakia in a town called Polana in 1929.  
Czec hosl
ovakia is  highlighted on this m ap of Europe.
 
 
In 1939, Germany oc c upied one half of Czec hos lovakia and Hungary the other half.  After  the 
Germ an invas ion of the Soviet Union in 1941, c onditions  in Polana wors ened.  By Apr il
 
1944, Martin's  
fam ily was  tr ansported to the Munkac s  ghetto.  The arrow on this  map of Czec hos lovakia points to 

Munkac s .

family m em ber s were c hos en for s lave labor.  The arrow points  to the location of Aus c hwitz.
 
Later Mar ty and his  father  wer e s ent to the Mauthaus en c onc entr ation c am p in Austria.  The s ec ond

After the war  Mar ty m oved to the United States.  He s erved in the U.S. Army dur ing the 
Korean War followed by a s ucc es sful c ar eer in the gr oc er y bus ines s .  He retir ed 18 year s  ago.  Marty's  
wife J oan pass ed away in 2013.  Marty and J oan have two c

their gr andc hildr en just com pleted law s c hool.
 
 
Marty has  been a volunteer  here in the Mus eum  for the past 16 years .  In addition to leading

In the past two years  Marty has  traveled at the invitation of the Austr ian government to the

memory."
 

 
With that I would like you to join m e in welc om ing our Fir st Per s on, Marty Weis s.
 
 
[Applaus e]
 
 
Marty, thank you s o m uch for joining us  today and for  being willing to be our
 
First Per s on
.
  
You have s o muc h to s hare with us  today s o we're going to go ahead and get started.
  
You've told m e 
in the past, Marty, about your life in Czec hos lovakia as  a c hild befor e the war.  So why don't we s tart 

fir s t with you telling us a little bit about your  family, your  c omm unity, and your  life befor e the war  began.
 
> > MartinWeis s :  Ok .  I c ame fr om a sm all town.  Ac tually, it was  a village mor e than a small town.  Let 
m e explain bec aus e s ome of you may not r ealize Czec hos lovakia exis ted when I was  a kid, ok ?  From  

World War I
 
--
 s
inc e World War I
, t
hen today, the Czec h Republic , Slovakia, and our part was  the m or e 
e
as twar d.  The reas on I'm  explaining is  bec aus e today that part is Ukraine.
 
 
When I was  growing up, we c ons ider ed ours elves  ver y, ver y fortunate. Why?  Bec aus e 
Czec hos lovakia was  a dem oc r ac y.  I had older brothers and s ister s.  by the way, I c am e from  a fa
m ily 
of nine c hildren.  So I had older  brothers and s ister s .  I was  number s even, s o I had s om ething to look 

up to.  
 
 
They were all very, ver y happy to be living, very c ons c ious  of the democ r ac y.  
 
I remember 
when I was  in thir d gr ade, I alr eady had the g r as p of it.  We had Czec h s c hools , s o we wer e going to 

Czec h s c hools .  However , the population in our  area was  m os tly Rus s .  Didn't c all them Rus s ian, 
nec es s arily but called them  Rus s.  They wer e a European Rus s ian.  They wer e a little different than the 
R
us s ians  from Rus s ian, let's s ay.  However , the language is  still Rus s ian but a differ ent level.
 
 
Cons equently, when I was  very young, I lear ned to s peak  Rus s ian im mediately bec aus e all 
the kids in the neighbor hood were Rus s ian.  Like I s ay, I went to Czec h
 
s chool.  I r em ember our  life 
was  pr etty good.  Don't get me wr ong. We worked har d.  
 
 
By the way, my father had a bus ines s and he als o had our  own farm.  So we grew our own 
food, liter ally.  We wer e s elf
-
s ustaining.
 
 
So this  is basic ally what my back gr ound is .  Things were improving.  We were looking forwar d 
like
 
--
 
we tr ied to be more m odern.  So already we got
 
--
 
one of my older sis ter s
 
--
 
m os t people didn't go 

3 
 
to high sc hool.  We didn't have a high s c hool in town.  But there was a big town 10
 
kilom eter
s  away .  
So my older  s is ters  wer e alr eady going to high s chool over ther e.
 
 
And by the way, you hav e to live with s om ebody or take a bus ever y day and s o on.  So it 
was n't that eas y.  But the point is we were improving fr om wher e we were.  Ok?  Things were
 
just 
European, old
-
fas hioned. 
 
 
I had older  br other s.  When they got older, they didn't want to s tay home anym or e and work 
for m y father for fr ee s o they went to the c ity to look  for a job.  So they left.  In the meantime, one of my 
older  s is ters  went to c ollege already in the c ity
, i
n Munkac , ac tually.  And that was  a big deal.  Even if I 
have to s ay s o, s he was  the only one from  the whole town.  But bec aus e she was  older , s he was  my 

sister 
--
 
s he had for m e as  I was  gr owing up.  The reas on being, I r ealized how im portant educ ation is .
 
 
I c ould go on and on but I'll s hift to s om ething els e.  So this  is  bas ic ally
 
--
 
like I s ay, our  life 
was  good. We lived well.  We didn't go to c ountry c lubs  or  anything like this  but we lived well.  We had 

ever ything we needed and s o on.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  I was  struc k  when you wer e saying that you knew what democ rac y was .  You told m e 

not only did you know what democ rac y was  but you had even in grade s chool a s ens e of r ights .  You 
had r ights.
 
> > MartinWeis s :  Right.
 
> > Bill
 
Bens on:  The other  thing I was going to ask  you about is  your father  had a bus ines s, as  you 
s aid.  He had been a veter an of the Fir st Wor ld War.  Is n't that r ight?
 
> > MartinWeis s :  Right.  Ser ved in the Hungar ian Em pir e, in that Arm y.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And your  fam ily lived in this  ar ea for a ver y, very long time.
 
> > MartinWeis s :  A long tim e.  I don't know how long but a long tim e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  I think at leas t s ever al hundr ed year s .
 
> > MartinWeis s :  Pr obably.  I have no way of k nowing.  In thos e days  you didn't 
look for
 
--
 
so far back.  
A ll 
I knew is  m y grandfather was  ther e, then his  childr en wer e ther e.  My grandfather died before I was  
bor n actually s o I didn't k now him.  But we belonged ther e.  This was  our home.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Your hom e.  And, of c our s e, Mar ty, all of that c hanged dram atic ally for you and your  
family onc e the Hungarians oc c upied your  part of Czec hos lovakia in 1939.  Tell us  what happened 

when the Hungar ians  took  over your  par t of Czec hos lovakia.
 
> > MartinWeis s : Well, when the Hungar ians  occ upied our  area, like I mentioned befor e
 
--
 
like you 
m entioned befor e, Germany took  the Czec h part and the Hungarians  took  our part.  That was  their 
paym ent bec aus e they joined the Nazis .
  
As  s oon as  they c am e in, we wer e c onc erned bec aus e h
er e 
we knew what we had.  And we already knew that they are not like that.  Hungar y was  next door, 
however  they didn't have the dem ocr ac y.  They still had the anc ient
 
--
 
I m ean, the old s ys tem of 
ar is toc r ac y and so on.
 
 
You have to r em em ber , I was  10 year s
 
old.  And I r emember  hearing that.  I immediately didn't 
like them.  Ok ?  By us , nobody r uled over  you.  And I heard that the over lor ds , or the landlor ds  were big 

land owner s  and village people would wor k for them at their  m erc y and they paid them whatever  they 

wanted to.  And they decided if their  kids s hould go to s c hool or  not. When I hear d that, I s aid: Who in 
the heck  are they?  You know?  I r em ember really feeling that.  So imm ediately I found r eas ons  not to 
like them.
 
 
Like I s ay, when they c ame in the beginning, my father s aid, well, I guess  they're not so bad.  I 
know the Hungar ians .  They're ok.  But then as  tim e went on, like a year  or  s o until they s tar ted 
s howing their true c olor s and all of a s udden we found out that ever ything was c hanging.
  
Changed 
entirely, our whole life c hanged.
 
 
Firs t they c losed our s c hools . Whic h, by the way, we had to go to Rus s ian s chools .  Again, 
I'm rambling too m uc h, but they c los ed our s c hools .  We have to go to Russ ian s c hools , whic h was  fine 
but
 
--
 
if they s p
oke Russ ian but we c an't know the alphabet.  So her e I was  going into four th gr ade and 
I didn't even know the alphabet.
  
Unlike the Czec h s c hools , they were s ort of moder n alr eady.  They 
were liberated, if you will.  They had a sys tem wher e the teac hers wer e nasty, old
-
fashioned.  They 
c ons tantly went ar ound hitting everybody.  Really.  It was  like an awakening.  They wouldn't even give 

4 
 
us  a c hanc e to lear n the alphabet.  They expec ted us  to lear n how to write in Rus s ian. We didn't know 
how to write in Russ ian.  We k new how to s peak  it but that was  it.
  
So this is  at 10, 11 year s old.  That's 
a big thing in your life.  But this  was  just the beginning.
 
 
So fr om there on things jus t got wor s e.  The Hungarians  wer e ther e for lik e a year  or  s o.  Then 
the fir s t 
thing they did, they took  away the J ewis h bus ines s es  and gave it to s omebody that was  a Nazi 
c or r obor ator
 
or a Nazi him s elf.  So all the bus iness es  were taken away.
  
They jus t kept on 
m oving
 
--
 
ever y tim e you tur ned ar ound, they came up with a new edic t.
 
 
In the m eantim e, by 1941 or s o, they dr afted all the J ewis h men of m ilitary age into the 
s er vic e.  But not into the Ar my.  You have to rem em ber, the J ews  wer e undes irable.  We were 
politic ally undes irable.  We were like jus t
 
--
 
like the Nazis, we wer e not people, we wer e jus t J ews .  Not 
only that, but they had a s logan.  They never c alled you the J ew
.  T
hey c alled you a "Stinkin' J ew."  
That was  like bac on and eggs.  I r em ember
.  Yo
u were resentful, of c our s e.  So that was  to start with. 
 
In the m eantim e, w
e were pr oud people.  My father  was  a pr oud m an.  He didn't take it too well.  But 
you lear ned to live with whatever  you have.
 
 
In the m eantim e, like I s aid, they induc ted all the men, inc luding my two older br other s .  
Somehow m y one older br other , he was  ac tually of age but s om ehow they mis s ed him s o he stays  

hom e.
  
They put them into what you c all
 
--
 
now they c oined a word for it, labor  battalions . What it was , 
it was  s lave labor  on the Arm y juris dic tion but they wor e c ivilian c lothes .  They weren't allowed to touc h 
a weapon or anything lik e this .  They us ed them for like on the Rus s ian fr ont.  My two older  br others  
ended up
 
--
 
they us ed them  for burying the dead, digging m inefields , thos e kinds  of work.
 
 
Another  thing they did, they us ed them  fr om  our  area all the way to Rus s ia.  The Uk r aine and 
Poland.  If you look  on the map, Uk r aine and Poland, all of thos e areas  is all m ountains  and for ests .  
They had them c ut the fores t down all the way to Poland and to the Ukr aine.  Ukraine is a vas t c ountr y.  

So th
ey us ed thous ands of thes e men thr ough this .
 
 
Now, why did they want to c ut out the tr ees ?  Becaus e the partis ans  c ould hide in the fores t.  
The tr ees  not exis ting, they c ouldn't hide so well.  So that's why.  So they had this  progr am.  That's  
what they us
ed them for .
 
 
Cons equently, they wer e abus ed.  They wer e not tr eated very well.  But they ended up on the 
eas ter n fr ont, on the fr ontlines .  So this  jus t gives  you an exam ple.
 
 
I'm going to s top ther e with that line
.  
I'll get back to it later.  But I told
 
you that for a r eas on s o 
you under s tand a little bit.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Marty, you told m e when I firs t met you
 
--
 
I was  str uck  by your phr as e that you did 
ever ything you c ould to survive but m os t of it was  at night.  That things took  plac e in the dark .
 
>>
 
MartinWeis s :  Oh, yeah.  At hom e yet.  Yeah.  My father was  in busines s , in the meat bus ines s .  
Ok?  They took  all the lic ens es  from  all the J ewis h people and gave it to somebody els e.  Ours they 

didn't.  They left my father with his  lic ens e.  It s ounds  funny.  He was  the only one.  But what happened, 
they had a quota how m any s teers or c alfs you wer e allowed to s laughter.  But they wouldn't give us  
any allotm ent bec aus e we were J ewis h.  Ok ?
 
 
However , it s ounds funny, but we s tayed in bus ines s .  We were doing busines s .  And even the 
polic e
 
--
 
by the way, they didn't have a polic em an like her e.  The polic e there were gendarmes and they 
were not allowed to be marr ied.  So they had a c ook  and a kitc hen
 
--
 
you know, like in their  quarter s.  
They were als o ver y
 
nas ty.  They were like
 
--
 
a little like s tate tr ooper s but they were Hungar ian.
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
> > MartinWeis s :  I didn't m ean
 
--
 
>> 
[Laughter]
 
> > MartinWeis s :  I take it back .  I didn't m ean to com pare the s tate tr oopers .  God for bid.
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
>> 
MartinWeis s :  No.  Some m aybe but most were jus t norm al people.
 
 
The reas on I used s tate tr ooper s as  an exam ple is  bec aus e they were ver y, ver y s tr uc tured.  
You know, under s tric t, str ic t r ules.  By the way, they wer e not allowed to be mar ried, either .  S
o frankly, 
they wer e nas ty.  And they were all Nazis  or  Nazi s ym path
izers
.  But s ome were not.
  
The reas on I'm 

5 
 
telling that
 
--
 
I find it very  c omic al. We were s elling them  m eat for their kitchen.  And we were not 
allowed to do it. 
 
 
Sinc e we didn't have any phones  in thos e days , they would s end detectives  to s noop on us.  
They wanted to c atc h us at s omething.  So they us ed to c ome ar ound, c om e in disguis e or whatever .
 
So this  c ook , even though it was  quite a dis tanc e fr om  us, s he would liter ally r un to our
 
hous e, war n us  
to be c ar eful.  She was  sym pathetic  to us.  So just a little nons ens e, but, you know. 
 
 
Any way, the r eason Bill m entioned it, s o we had to s laughter our animals the night. When I 
s ay at night
 
--
 
we didn't have elec tr ic ity, rem em ber .  So we
 
had to us e c andles , m os t of the tim e we did.  
But we had keros ene lam ps , like lanter ns.  I was  like 11, 12.  My older brother was  a ver y s tr ong, 
c apable guy.  And he was  able to take liter ally throw down the s teer and tie him up.  
 
 
By 
the way, we wer e ko
sher.  In 
c as e you don't k now what kos her means, that m eans
 
--
 
it's  a 
r itual killing.  That means we have a tr ained pers on, trained m an, that knows  how to do it.  And the 

whole idea of kos her killing or s laughtering is  that the anim al is  not s upposed to fe
el the pain.  Ok ?  
Now, how could you kill s om ething without pain?  It does n't wor k .  But never theles s, the knife, they had 
a s pec ial, s pec ial knife.  When I tell you s pec ial, it was  s o s har p
 
--
 
it was  long
 
--
 
that if you c ut yourself, 
you wouldn't even feel it.  That's how s har p it was . 
 
 
So I had to hold the c andles .  And this is  by c andle light or lanter n.  He would have to m ake 
the inc is ion in a c ertain spot.  God forbid he made a mis take and it was n't k os her  anymor e.  This  is 
what the r ules ar e, J ewish
 
r ules  ar e. 
 
 
Any ways  s o after we did all of that, then we have to s ell the stuff.  Able to sell it in the s tore, 
one anim al or  som ething.  So if you killed two or thr ee, it was  ok.  Som ehow they didn't c atc h us.
 
 
The point of this  was
 
--
 
after we did the killing, we have to get rid of all the evidenc e.  Oh, 
yeah.  So you have to get r id of all the evidenc e that we slaughtered anything.  So between
 
--
 
by the 
way, ever ything had to be done 1:00, 2:00
 
in the m or ning.  That was  the only tim e our neighbors wer e
 
as leep.  You didn't know whom  you c ould trust.  People, even though they were good neighbors , but in 
a s ituation like this , you really don't know who for a c ouple of dollar s  will go to the polic e and report you 
or  s omething.  So we really didn't know how 
to trus t people.
  
If you lived am ong
 
--
 
if you lived together , 
we got along.  But in the war time, believe it or not, you c an't tr ust anybody.  It's jus t the way it wor ks .
 
So we had to do this.  And by 6:00
 
or 7:00
 
in the m or ning, ther e was  no trac e left.  
We made s ure 
ever ything was  gone and hidden.  
 
 
This  is the kind of life we lived.  But we wer e very 
indus tr ious
.  My father wouldn't just give up 
s o he did this  thr oughout.
  
So this  is  how hard life was, ac tually.  
 
 
Then they c am e out with an edic t, all the J ews  have to wear the yellow s tar .  Ok?  By that tim e 
ever ybody got c ocky and nas tier bec aus e they already had a lic ens e
 
--
 
they didn't have to treat you 
nic e anym or e.
 
 
This  went on and on.  As things  went on, it was  wors e.  But in the meantime, by now
, by 
`
42, 
`
41, 
`
42, late 
`
41, 
`
42, they kept on hear ing atr oc ities  in the eastern part of Europe.  Like in the Uk raine, 
Poland.  Then we hear d of the Polis h ghetto.
 
 
By the way we lived not far from  Poland.  So we heard ever ything
 
--
 
ther e wer e no 
news pape
r s  or  r adios .  This  is  by gr apevine.  Jus t c ame thr ough from people es c aping or whatever.  So 

that's  when we fir s t heard of the atr oc ities , s omething like this . 
 
We kept hear ing about atr oc ities.  Mor e 
and m ore, and mor e vivid.  
 
 
In fac t, one I r em ember l
ike in the Wars aw Ghetto
 
--
 
theWar s aw Ghetto was  big.  They had a 
lot of people ther e.  Poland had like 3.5
 
m illion J ews  s o they had a lot of people to put in the ghetto.  
Then they would put people on a truck  and pipe in exhaus t to the back  of the tr uck  
and 
r
ide around until 
they died. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Marty, you and your fam ily r em ained in thes e c irc umstances  you've des c r ibed and 

m uc h els e that you have not been able to des cr ibe until 1944.  You told me that by 1944 that you k new 
that, quote, s ooner or later you would be ar rested.
 
> > MartinWeis s :  Oh, yeah.
 

6 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Your mother wanted to be prepared for  that.  Tell us  what you did or  what your  mother  
did to try to pr epar e for  that pos s ibility.
 
> > MartinWeis s :  Actually as  early as  1943 already.
  
They ac tually took some people fr om our area 
and they did pick  them up and s hipped them out to the Ukr aine r ather earlier , about the beginning of 
`
43, I believe.  So we figured our  num ber is  going to c om e up s ooner or later .  But for the time being we 
we
r e left alone.  But there were always  rumors they wer e going to arr est us . 
 
 
So one time, the r umor s  were very, ver y s tr ong r umors.  So we wer e prepar ing.  We had a big 
family.  I had two younger  s ister s.  I had two older s is ter s .  So we prepared food that
 
would withs tand, 
have s om ething to take with us . 
 

 
One of the things  I rem em ber s he m ade is  honey cookies .  They wer e like oatmeal c ookies 
but m ade with honey.  You ask yours elf why honey.  Well, the reas on s he us ed honey ins tead of sugar  
is  if you us e honey in the c ookies , they c ould last for a long tim e.  They don't s poil.  So we had a lot of 
c ookies.  A lot of c ookies!  [Laughter]
 
 
It tur ned out it was  a hoax.  We wer e not arr es ted.  So we had to laugh about it.  Her e we 
were s ur e they wer e going pick us up.  And here it was  s or t of like, gee, we did this for nothing.  But 
nevertheles s
 
--
 
it's funny.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Marty, did your  family c ons ider  at any point trying to go into hiding? 
 
> > MartinWeis s :  Yes.  We did a lot bec aus e my father was n't the kind jus t to give up.  But there was  

no plac e to hide. We wer e not on a pos ition
 
--
 
nobody had enough money to do anything, God knows  
what.  Plus  we lived in a polic e s tate.  
 
 
So in a polic e state, you may not r ealize
 
--
 
we s hould today, about the gover nment lis tening to 
the phones and all of that stuff. Well
, 
in a polic e state you c an't go from her e to ther e without getting 
s topped for papers  or whatever.  Everything you do s om ebody's watc hing you.  You didn't even have to 

be guilty.  They would jus t tak
ing now ques tioning and beat the daylight, give you the third degr ee.  This  
was  the norm .  Ok? 
 
 
So it was
 
--
 
thought about going into hiding.  For a while m y father would s ay m y brother and I 
and he s hould go into hiding.  But then we r ealized to leave m y
 
m other with my younger s is ters  and s o 
on, s o we decided not to.  But we wer e tempted to do it.  But it was  not lik e in the states  wher e you 

c ould go from  one s tate to another. We didn't live in that kind.
  
First of all, we didn't have mobility.  We 
didn'
t have enough m oney and s o on.  So who do you separ ate?  Whom  do you s ac r ific e? 
 
So we decided not to go.  
 
 
Although
 
--
 
actually, we wer e r eally s erious  about going into the for es t.  Again, even the for es t 
we wouldn't be s afe because the peas ant
s 
would see us.  By the way, the peas ant
s 
were Rus s ian.  
They didn't like the Hungar ians  any more than we did bec aus e the Hungar ians  looked down at them as  
inferior.  They didn't like us  bec aus e we wer e Jews  but they didn't like them bec aus e they thought th
ey 
were s tupid, actually.  J us t like the Germ ans.  They felt they wer e upper  c las s , upper people, upper 
hum an beings and the others  were jus t plain inferior people.  They had no problem doing anything they 
wanted to them.  So they were not tr eated ver y well either  but they were not dis cr iminated agains t them  

bec aus e there were too m any.  Ther e was  a whole ar ea. 
 
 
So but in the s ame tim e, in s pite of that, we c ould never know whom we c ould tr ust.  You jus t 
c ouldn't trus t them.  It's jus t that s imple.  
Bec ause like I s ay, for a dollar they would give away their  
m other  probably or s om ething.  So we r eally didn't know.  So we s tayed at home.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You stayed together.
 
> > MartinWeis s :  Together , r ight.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  In 1944, Mar ty, your  family was  then for c ed into a ghetto.  You wer en't there very long.  

Tell us what happened from  ther e.
 
> > MartinWeis s : Well, we wer e forc ed into a ghetto.  Ac tually, it was  a bric k factor y.  They had two, 
three of them in the c ity.  Eac h one of them  was  filled up imm ediately.
  
They took  us to the ghetto, in 
the brick fac t
or
y, like I s ay.  They put us  like a barn, wher e they kept the bric ks.  You could s ee daylight 
through the boar ds.  The ground was  dir t.
  
So it was  r aining, s pr ing of the year.  So we laid in 
the m ud.  

7 
 
We got up in the morning, in the wet. We had no plac e to c hange.  We took  along c lothes, dis hes , 
family needs  and s o on.
 
 
But you know, when you see your par ents, your mother in partic ular
 
--
 
exc us e me.  It's  hurtful.  
But m or e than that, over there, in the ghetto, I don't even rem ember how we s urvived there.  I don't 
r em em ber getting food or anything like this.  Somehow we did.  We were only there a s hort time.  I think 
if I r emem ber about five weeks , whic h is
 
--
 
all ghettos exis ted for a long t
ime, like in Poland and 
Lithuania.
 
 
After about five weeks, they brought in boxc ars , railroad tracks , and they put us on a train.  At 
that tim e
 
--
 
like in our c ar ther e was  125 people in the boxc ar.  You have to r em ember  ther e wer e a lot 
of old people, a lot of young people in our s oc iety.  In our s oc iety
 
--
 
like I told you, I c ame fr om a family 
of nine.  Som e people had 12 c hildren.  Some had s ix or thr ee.  But everybody had s m all c hildren.  

Ever ybody had.  They pac ked us into the boxc ar.  That was  our trip to Aus chwitz.
 
 
Now, until then it was  all done by the Hungar ians .  Now the Hungarians , when they put us in 
the boxc ar, they turned us  over  to the SS.
  
Now, to s how you
 
--
 
what I'm going to tr y to im pr es s upon 
you one thing that alway s  impr es s
ed m e t
hen and s till does .  People wer e mean.  You c ould never 
believe that hum an beings c ould be s o m ean and nas ty to other hum an beings .
 
 
I'll give one dem ons tr ation.  There was  one SS man, an offic er, walking through a ghetto.  For 
s om ething to do, there was this young fellow there.  He mus t have been 19, 20 year s  old.  He was  s or t 

of like r etar ded.  He was  als o s pec t
i
c ally blind.  He had glas s es with grooves  in it.  He was  s low 
m entally.  He s aw him .  He just took out his  pis tol and started s hooting ar ound, wanting
 
him  to dance. 
 
I r em ember, I s aw that and it m ade suc h an impres s ion on m e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And you're like 14, 15 year s  of age.
 
> > MartinWeis s :  Yeah, by that tim e 14, 15.  yeah.  I don't know how human beings s hould do this.  He 

was  doing his  job.  He
 
was  an offic er .  He was  Ges tapo, whatever .  But why would you do that?  This  is  
the kind of hum ility you were up against.
 
 
So they put us  in a boxcar .  And the way, the Hungarians , not the Germ ans , picked up 
450,000 people at that par tic ular  tim e.  Ther e 
were mor e before and m or e after  but not in a mas s lik e 
this .  Two months , they shipped out 450,000 people to Aus c hwitz.  The Hungar ians  did that.  The 

r eas on I give them  a lot of credit what they did is  bec aus e you look  at the his tor y books today, there's  
not one mention, not one mention in there, a his tor y in Hungar y or  histor y of the world that the 
Hungar ians ever  did anything.  They were vic tim s .  They wer e vic tim s  of Nazis , vic tims  of Rus s ia.  If 
you r ead the Hungar ian his tory, that's  how their his tor y 
r eads. 
 
 
In fac t, I'll give you another little thing that nobody talks about.  I told you we c am e from  
Czec hos lovakia.  Slovakia was  jus t another s tate.  We wer e a fir s t s tate.  Right?  Slovakia had 73,000 

J ewis h population, 73,000.  The Slovaks, instead of being occ upied by the Nazis  like the Czec h was , 
the Slovaks dec lared their  own independenc e and they joined the Nazis .  Ok? 
 
 
By this  tim e the Germans  wer e alr eady into Uk r aine and Rus s ia, whic h is  next door .  They 
as ked
 
--
 
I found out just rec ently, by the way.  I didn't know that before.  They as ked the Germ ans  to 
take the J ews .  And they wer e the first ones  out of our ar ea that wer e ac tually ar rested and s hipped out.  
73,000 people, I found out jus t lately, actually, the num ber s
, 
3,000 people s ur vived.
  
Ok ? 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So, Mar ty, you wer e telling us  that you wer e put in a boxc ar and you went with your 

family to Aus c hwitz.
 
> > MartinWeis s :  Right.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Can you tell us a little about what that was  like when you got ther e? 
 
> > Martin Weis
s :  Firs t of all, in the boxc ar its elf
 
--
 
you have to remem ber, 125 people in the boxc ar  with 
bundles , old people.  No food.  No water.  The only thing
 
--
 
we wer e tr aveling to Poland.  We didn't 
know, by the way, wher e we wer e going.  We k new we wer e in big trouble. We heard of the atroc ities  
in Poland and Ukr aine by now.  We hear d all kinds  of s tor ies .
 
 
So we c am e to Poland.  The tr ain s topped at the s tations bec aus e the tr ains  in thos e days  
needed to get water  for the loc omotives  or  s omething, for  the s team .  Anyway, s o we s aw we wer e in 

Poland bec aus e we s aw through the opening of the door the s igns.  I remem ber I s aw a Polis h c ity and 

8 
 
s o on. We wanted water.  We were s c r eaming for water .  Nobody would give you a drop of water.  We 
hear d people go by and talk but nobody would ev en m ake an attempt. 
 
 
Finally, we c am e to Aus chwitz.  It just happened in our c as e
 
we c am e during the night.  You 
have to r emem ber, we never  hear d of Ausc hwitz, we never hear d of gas k illings . We hear d of mass  
killings  and s hootings  and s tuff whic h was  bad enough.  But we c ame to Aus c hwitz. We c ame dur ing 
the night.  I think  it was  ar ound m idnight.  The tr ain s topped.  As  s oon as they opened up the doors, 

they s tarted s c r eaming.  Ther e were thes e people in uniforms
 
--
 
str iped uniform s , whic h wer e pris oner s  
whic h we didn't know bec aus e they acted nas ty.  And the r eas on they acted nas ty, that was  their job.  If 

they didn't do it, they would s hoot them  or  whatever.  But they would hav e to ac t like that.  But we didn't 
know that.
 
 
The
 
boxc ars  ar e pr etty high for  a c ivilian or for c hildr en, old people, to jum p down.  They're 
r eally high even for a gr own
-
up.  They s c r eam ed get out, fast, fas t.  And finally we wer e off the tr ain.  
The fir st thing
 
--
 
the per im eter was  s urr ound with flood lights bec aus e it was  during the night.  And not 
only were we s urr ounded by flood lights but all of a s udden ther e wer e guards .  Every four, five feet 

ther e wer e guar ds with a r ifle and their  finger  literally on the tr igger .  For the life of me I didn't k no
w why 
they needed it.  I found out later  we wer e in the c amp, ins ide 
Birkenau
, actually, whic h was  part of 
Aus c hwitz.  The fenc es were elec trified.  But the fac t that we wer e fac ed with that would give you even 
m or e fear.  Plus  ever ybody was  s c r eaming.
 
 
In
 
the m eantime, ever ybody was holding their  c hildren, to eac h other, not to be s epar ated.  On 
top of it, they have dogs , nas ty, nas ty, killer dogs .  They wer e
 
--
 
you jus t look  at their teeth gr owling.  
They were ready to tear  anybody apar t.  Ther e wer e s ever al dogs ar ound the perim eter .  That was  our  
welc ome to Aus c hwitz. 
 
 
Let m e put it this  way.  Es s entially 
if there is  
hell or bedlam, I don't think  you c ould ever
 
--
 
I 
don't think you could ever  pic tur e a s c ene that I'm talking about.
 
 
Now, no s ooner we were down on the gr ound they s eparated the men from  the women.  
Th
ere was  an offic er standing in polis hed boots, ver y s harp.  A real s harp
-
looking uniform, tailor
-
made 
and s o on.  You would have to go through the line.
 
 
Now, what do
 
you
 
c all it, the m en, lik
e I s ay, were s eparated fr om the women.  The wom en 
and the c hildren and all wer e to a different line.  The older  people als o, all of them went to one s ide.
 
Now, we knew
 
--
 
on the tr ain we were talking that they expec t ever ybody to wor k .  However, women 
and
 
c hildren c an't wor k  or the old people c an't work .  So we r ealized
 
--
 
the rumor
 
--
 
again, ther e was  
r um or .  Nobody told us.  The people that work, labor, would be able to feed their families  that would be 

a tradeoff.
  
So we were a little c omforted by the rumor.  And it was just a rum or by the way.  
 
 
Befor e we got off the train
 
--
 
I was  not a big kid.  I was  about 14, 15, ac tually.  14, 15.  I put on 
a couple of extr a jackets befor e I got off the tr ain.  So my father  went thr ough, m y brother.  And I 

pas s ed.
  
I didn't know I was  s o lucky until a c ouple of days
 
--
 
actually, until the following morning I 
found out that alm ost all the kids I went to s c hool wer e did not.
  
Actually, in terms of my date of birth, I 

was  the only one bor n on m y year  fr om  the boys  that c ame back
f
rom my town. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You had put on the extr a c lothes  to look bigger and older.
 
> > MartinWeis s :  To look  bigger .  And it worked.  That's the only r eas on.  I c ould never understand.  

Some of the other kids  wer e as big as I was .  Ok? 
 
But evidently they didn't do that.  So I attr ibute it to 
that.
 
 
Any way, we went through the s elec tion.  They did the s am e thing with the wom en.  Like I s ay, 
the women, the c hildren and s o on, they wer e to the other  s ide.
 
 
In the m eantim e, we went thr ough 
s howers , real showers .  We had to s hed our c lothes, leave 
them behind.  We c ame out on the other s ide and they gave us  thos e s tr iped uniform s that you s ee in 
the pic tur es.  They gave us  a s hirt, a pair  of s horts , and thos e c lothes .  The problem with that was  in 
Eas ter n Europe, even though it was  the s pr ing, they marc hed us  off to the bar racks and we had 
wooden s hoes .  They took  away our  s hoes , too.  
 
 
They c ame up to the barrack and by this  tim e it was  dawn.  Mus t have been like 4:00
 
in the 
m or ning or s o.  We c ame up to the barr ack s , which was  a few hundred yar ds  away
 
--
 
yeah, s omeplac e 

9 
 
in the ar ea not too far.  Again, they wouldn't let us into the barr ack  r ight away.  It looked like we 
wer e
 
--
 
a dr ear y, drear y s cene.  It was  mis ty, r ainy
 
--
 
not quite r ain b
ut s ort of like a mis t with a fine rain.
 
Mos t of all, we s aw the big c himneys from the c r emator ium s.  Befor e that we never heard of 

c r em ator ium s  where we c am e from.  We just didn't know it exis ted.  And here ar e thes e big c himneys  
all the way into the sky with black sm oke c om ing out.  But more than that, you s melled fles h bur ning, 
liter ally like a bar bec ue.  We c ouldn't m ake out what was  going on.
 
 
So in the meantim e, it was  ver y c old, r eally freezingly c old.  It was  the s pring.  The reas on I'm 
telling you this bec aus e later I'll c ome back  to it.  And you could s ee like ins tead of s now you had s oot 

fr om  the c him neys , like blac k  flakes c om ing down.  This  was  our exper ienc e the fir st mor ning ther e in 
Aus c hwitz.
 
 
Meanwhile, not far  fr om us , a few hundred yar ds  
away from us , we s aw this  huge fire.  It was  
like the length of a football field.  It was  under  the pine tr ees .  The flam es was  going high, almos t to the 

top to the trees.  That's how high the flam es  wer e.  One of the k apos
 
c am e ar ound and he told us
 
--
 we 
as ked him what this  fire was .  He s ays :  
See this  fir e?  Thos e ar e your fam ilies  alr eady being bur ned.
  
Now, why did they do it?  The crematoriums , they had about five or s ix c r eam  forums.  I don't 
r em em ber if it was  final or  s ix but definitely five.  They were s o overtaxed they c ouldn't handle the 
volum e that they us ed the fir es to get r id of the r es t of the people.
  
Again, I didn't know that then.  
 
 
So in the meantim e, once we found that out, you c an jus t im agine how we felt.  I don't 
r em em ber
 
--
 
I w
as  young.  I don't r em em ber  even c rying.  It was  jus t stunned.
  
We realized we wer e in 
a different wor ld.  You know, like all of a s udden you just s ens e it.  Again, I didn't know that befor e but I 
know it now bec aus e the Mus eum does  res earc h.  But we c am e to Aus c hwitz bec aus e they had so 
m any people c oming, s o m any tr ains c oming ever y day, they c ouldn't handle volumes .  But the killing 
r ate was  10,000 to 12,000 people a day.  This  was  r ound
-
the
-
c lock, 10,000 to 12,000 people.  Ok? 
 
 
To s how you the ghoulis h
nes s
 
--
 
again, I knew this from the Mus eum.  I didn't know that 
before
.
  
They burned the people in this ditc h.  They figured out m athem atically
 
--
 
they wer e Germ an.  
They were ver y c iv ilized, ver y lear ned.  Ok ?  They figured out that by us ing a c er tain am o
unt of 
flamm able fluids
 
--
 
like I s ay, I k now that now bec aus e
 
--
 
I hope you don't think I was  that s m ar t to 
figure it out.  They figur ed out by us ing a c ertain am ount of flam m able fluids  and the body fat fr om the 
people, they c ould literally elim inate s o m any people a day.  When I hear d that, I don't k now what to 
s ay after that.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Marty, when did 
you 
r ealize that you had los t your  m other  and your  s is ter s ?
 
> > MartinWeis s :  The next m or ning.  Yeah.  My two younger sis ter s  and my mother, immediately.  Like 
I s ay
 
--
 
m y father
 
--
 
m y brother  and m e s ur vived.  We wer e in this  group.  He was  im mediately 
s epar ated.  He was  taken s om eplace els e.  So we never s aw him  again. 
 
 
He, by the way, never  s howed up after the war .  I unders tand
 
--
 
he was  a ver y
 
s tr ong guy, 
very c apable.  He lived right to the ver y end.  He was  liber ated.  He dis appear ed.  J ust s omething 
happened to him.
 
 
In the m eantim e
 
--
 
what was  I going to s ay?  I just los t my train of thought. 
 
 
We wer e put into the barr acks.  Again, we had to s tand outs ide in the c old.  It was  s o c old and 
m is erable. We wer e s hivering.  So 15, 20 of us would have to get together jus t to keep our bodies  
warm .  They wouldn't let us  s tay in the bar racks  at all.  It had to be em pty in the m orning.  Go in at 
nigh
t.
  
 
 
They had all kinds of things to do, anything to m ake you m is er able.  This  is  s om ething I will 
never get over it.  People c ould do their job or whatever but
 
--
 
that's another thing that bothers  m e all 
the tim e.  It still does .  They enjoyed it.  Ok?  
This  is  s om ething as a human being, I'm s orry, I still c an't 
help it. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Marty, you, your  father , two of your s ister s and your br other wer e s elec ted for  s lav e 

labor .  You wer en't in Aus c hwitz for long.  You wer e
 
--
 
> > MartinWeis s :  No.  I was  in Aus c hwitz a very s hor t tim e. 
 
> > Bill B ens on:  Tell us a little bit.
 

10
 
 
> > MartinWeis s :  I was  in Aus c hwitz a ver y s hor t tim e.  They s hipped us  out right away.  They put us  
on a train.  To s how you the differ enc e, this  time they put 50 people in a boxcar not 125. We didn't 
have bundles . We had nothing.  We had to s it c ros s
-
legged. We were not allowed to move. We were 
not allowed to whis per  to eac h other.  There wer e two guar ds in eac h boxc ar .  Again, I don't k now why 

bec aus e the boxc ar s wer e locked.
  
All they left was  a little bit for the air. 
 
 
By the way, onc e we went through this exper ienc e, ever y plac e we went, we moved, we were 
told the next place they were going to killing us .  We wer e jus t r es igned that they wer e going to kill us .
 
Then we s tarted to r eas on, well, if they wanted to kill us , they c ould have gone her e.  Why would they 
take us ther e
?
  
It's  funny how your brain works .  At the tim e it's ver y s er ious .  Let's put it this  way.  Now 
it s ounds almost funny but it was n't.
 
 
So we c am e
 
--
 
we
 
were going wes tward this  time.  The r eas on we knew we wer e going 
wes twar d is  bec aus e we c am e to Austr ia.  And the tr ain s topped right on the Danube.  Then we s aid to 
eac h other :  A
-
ha, they are going to thr ow us  into the Danube.  Why?  Becaus e in H
ungary,
 
believe it or 
not, the Hungarian polic e were thr owing women and c hildren into the river .  And we als o heard they 

were doing it in the Ukr aine.  Ok?  It was n't the Germ ans doing it in Hungary.  The Hungarian police 
and the Arm y were thr owing in wom en and c hildren on a daily bas is , in 
`
44 and 
`
45, the beginning of 
`
45, until the Rus s ians came.
 
 
You look , again, nobody ever blam ed the Hungarians  for  anything.  And I'll even go s omething 
outs ide a little bit.  All the c ountries  that wer e c orroborators  with the
 
Nazis , in Eur ope, today gues s  what 
par ty is  getting stronger and s tr onger.  All of those c ountries , not one of them  adm itted they ever did 

anything.  And the s o
-
c alled Nazi Par ty
 
--
 
they c all them  som ething else now
 
--
 
ar e gaining m or e 
ground now than they ever did before.  Hatr ed of differ ent people.  It doesn't have to be J ews .  Ther e 

ar e not too many J ews  left ther e.  It's  r ight back  wher e it s tar ted.  Ok?  Today.  They belong to NATO.  

The E.U., all of that stuff. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You wer e sent to Mauthaus en firs t. What was  it like in Mauthaus en?
 
> > MartinWeis s :  By the way, ter rified as  we c ame to Mauthaus en.  Again, we c ame alongs ide
 
--
 
the 
tr ain stopped alongs ide this  huge m ountain.  It turned out later we found out it was  a stone quarr y.  

They mar c hed us  up to the top of the m ountain.  Her e is  this  big, big gate, like a fortres s.  They had 

r ocks.  They mined the roc k s .  So the whole c amp was  built from that.  So the front of Mauthaus en, 
walls  literally fr om like the anc ient
 
--
 
like in Englis h lite
r ature, you know, the c as tles, s om e of the big 
gates.  Jus t liter ally made the s ame, like anc ient.
 
 
We walked in
 
--
 
we wer e m ar c hed into Mauthausen.  By the way, ins tead of being c old and 
m is erable, it was  very s unny and hot on top of the mountain.  Again,
 
we have to s tand outs ide all day.
 
 
Her e we finally r ealized where the c onc entration cam p was .  We were proc es s ed.  Again, we 
didn't stay in Mauthaus en too long.  They proc ess ed us  and s hipped out very s hor tly to another c am p 
c alled Melk.
 
 
Now, Mauthaus en 
was  a very huge c am p.  By the way, it's  still there.  Now it's a memorial.  
Mauthausen had lots  of s ubc amps.  They all had a different am ount of people. Wher e I was , it was  

about 13,000 population.  Some plac es wer e m aybe 300.  Some
 
plac es wer e 4,000
 d
epe
nding on what 
kind of work you were doing, what you wer e as s igned to.  That's why they had s o m any.
 
 
Now, I was  told after  the war  there was  like 40 of the s ubc amps .  Again, they do r es earc h.  
The Museum is  up to about 90 that they had. We didn't know about it.  Some of them pr obably were 

s m all.
 
 
Mauthausen, the people that were s tationed in Mauthaus en, the death rate was  c ons tant.  
Why?  They work them  in what do
 
you
 
c all it, c utting out the rock .  But not with mac hines or equipment.  
They had liter ally manual labor , picks  and s hovels .
 
 
Mauthausen was  als o
 
--
 
s o far  talking about the Jews .  People who wer e gas s ed were J ews .  
Nobody els e.  Although wait a minute.  I'll c lar ify that.  Roma gyps ies  als o.  But not all of them.  The 
s ic k  ones , s o on, the ones  that looked already like they were going to die.  They would tak e them in.  
But prim ar ily they wer e als o s tarved to death most of the time.
 

11
 
 
 
The people that wer e in Mauthaus en, Mauthaus en was  a c amp of equal oppor tunity, if you 
will.  They had lots  of Pols ,
 
Uk r ainians , Rus s ians, Rus s ian POWs.  They had Greeks, Italians .  You 
nam e it.  They were repres ented.  Anyplac e the Germ ans had oc c upation they wer e there. We all were 
tr eated the s am e.  Ever y body was  jus t another pr is oner .  Ok?  There was no dis tinc tion
. 
 
So this
 
was  like a new awakening.  Now, when we wer e shipped out to Melk and Melk was  a 
c am p
 
--
 
our job was  to dig under the big mountain.  That was  har d labor.
  
But the people in 
Mauthaus en
 
--
 
by the way, politic al pris oners.  Ac tually, we wer e all c ons ider ed politic als . We all had 
m arkings why you wer e there.  However, in Mauthaus en and in Melk, a lot of people wer e
 
--
 
yeah, they 
were Germ ans , too.  Som e were politic al.  But ther e was  a lot of Germans  that wer e not politic al but 

were in for c ivil c r im
es  lik e mur der, rape, r obber y, embezzlem ent, whatever .  So they were there for 
differ ent r eas ons. 
 
And us ually the Germans, becaus e they s poke the language, they bec ame the 
kapos.  So s ome of them obvious ly were very nasty, ver y bad.  But we had one guy, he was  in this  for  

m ur der, and he tur ned out, in hinds ight, I don't think  he was  that bad. 
 
 
As  s oon as I c ame, I learned the m ec hanis m
 
--
 
how can I put it?  How to
 
--
 
I dec ided off 
hand
 
--
 
he introduced hims elf to us .  I'm never going to be standing at the
 
end of the line or the front of 
the line.  I'll be s omeplace in the back .  Nobody s hould notic e m e. 
 
Then I went into the line, I m ade 

s ur e I was  always  s om eplac e wher e I was  not very expos ed.  Becaus e then they would s ingle you out 
for s omething.
 
> > B ill
 
Bens on:  Our  time is  growing s hort now.  Tell us
 
--
 
you m entioned that you were forc ed to 
tunnel
 
--
 
build tunnels  at Melk.  Ther e was  extremely har d, dangerous  wor k .  Say a little bit about what 
you wer e forc ed to do. 
 
> > MartinWeis s :  Needles s  to s ay, again, it was all manual labor . We wer e digging tunnels.  Working 

har d would be putting it m ildly.  We had to do everything m anually.  That m eans  we had to dig with 

pic ks and s hovels  into the m ountain, into the limes tone, whatever  it was .  We did have, tho
ugh, air 
ham mers  that were able to dig deeper.  So we us ed air  hamm er s.  And then we als o us ed dynamite, 
like a long drill.  You had to pus h in the dynamite.  Som e blown up.  I didn't do that but I was  ther e.  
This  is the kind of work you did.
 
 
Then to m ix
 
the c em ent, literally we had to c ar ry the c ement bags , whic h, by the way, wer e 
heav y
, e
s pec ially at m y age.  I was  not that big.  Plus
 
--
 
oh one thing I will s ay.  The food. We were 
always  s tarving, always  hungr y.  Ver y har d work when you'r e always  s tarving and hungr y.  I'm not 
talking hungr y.  I'm talking s tarving.
 
 
But to m ix the c ement we had to, what do
 
you
 
c all it, us e actually underground, take a s hovel 
with gravel and s and and m ix it.  Then s om ebody would pic k up the pale of
 
--
 
you s ee the dumbbell
s  in 
the gym
; 
you think  they're heavy.  Forget it.  That's  heavy.  They had like little boar ds  s et up like 
platform s.  You had to hand it to the next guy up, on top, until s omebody pour s  it into the wall. 
 

 
Believe it or not, in a year , les s  than a year , ac tually, we built s even tunnels , 13,000 
population.  So the wor k  was  very har d.  Like I s ay, we were s tarving all the time.
  
Cons equently, we 
had a death rate, es pec ially in the quota, r ather
 
--
 
the 13,000, every s ingle month bec aus e s o many 
Hungar ian new arr ivals, they wer e able to ask
 
--
 
they had to k eep the work for c e up to a c er tain level.  
So they brought in 3,000 people to replac e the people that peris hed.  Not bec aus e s om ebody gas sed 

them or
 
--
 
they just
 
--
 
if they were s ick, they went to a 
infirm ar y
 
and never  c ame out.  No matter what it 
was , onc e you went into the infirm ar y, you wer e finis hed.  So nobody wanted to go to the infir mar y, 

obvious ly. 
 
> > Bill
 
Bens on:  Mar ty, you would c ontinue there until almos t the end of the war when I think  then you 
w
er e sent to yet another c amp, Gunskir c hen.
 
> > MartinWeis s :  Right.  Back to Mauthaus en.  Bec aus e the Rus s ians were c om ing in from the eas t 
and s o on.  We c ame bac k  to Mauthaus en.  The fir s t thing they did is  they s epar ated out the J ewis h 
population fr om t
he r est.  Then I s aid to m ys elf
:  A
h!, 
O
k , now they'r e going to kill us .  Why would they 
s epar ate us ?  
 

 
Befor e they were tr eating us  alike.
  
So they took us  out of the main c amp and put us  alongs ide 
of the m ountain.  This  mountain had all thorn bushes , ve
r y neglec ted area.  It was  like s om ething for 

12
 
 
goats but not for people.  You c ouldn't even lay down.
  
And by now we were not getting any food.  But 
what we did get
 
--
 
if you wer e s tr ong enough to stand in line.  That time people looked m or e like 
zombies  than people. 
 
 
By the way, the br ead was  m ade m os tly from s awdus t.  Then they tr ied to c ut it.  The whole 
thing literally c rum bled like br ead c r um bs, like you buy a box of bread c r umbs  in the s upermark et.  You 
had to hold out your  palm  of your hand.  The guy
 
would take a ladle and put som e of the s tuff in your 
hand.
  
I s till r em ember you looked at it, it had piec e of mildew like the s ize of a green pea, gr een, blue, 
white, liter ally piec e of mildew.  And guess what.  You ate it.
 
 
Lo and behold, we figured the
y ar en't going to s hoot us now. Why?  Again.  Back to the s am e 
thing.  Why would they have s epar ated us ?  One day, lo and behold, they tell us  we ar e going on a 

m ar c h.  Again, rum or.  That they'r e going to take us  to the Swis s  border, and the allies  are g
oing to give 
them tr ucks in exc hange for us .  Now, that s tupid I was  not.  I s aid:  Uh
-
huh,
 
s omebody will ask  for  a 
bas ket c as e. Who in the heck is going to give a truc k  for
 
us , es
pec ially for your  enem y?
 
 
So we wer e on a mar c h.  Somehow or other I felt a
 
little better  that we were on a mar c h.  I 
don't know why.  I had a c ertain lift.  By that tim e I was  s epar ated.  Before I was  with a c ous in.  By the 

way, my father died in M
elk f
r om exhaus tion, pneumonia, I think.  So I was  alone.  We marc hed.
 
 
The pr oblem with the m ar c h was  ever ybody was  in ver y poor s hape.  So when we c ame, what 
do you 
c all it
 
--
 
a pers on fell down.  The guard would just s hoot them  r ight ther e on the s pot.
 
 
Now, jus t incident about the inhumanity of man.  We were on a c ountry road.  There was  a 
potato on the ground
, o
ne s ingle potato.  One of the 
fellows
 
s aw it s o he jumped for it.  Another fellow 
s aw the s am e potato and jum ped as  well.  So they s tar ted fighting over the potato.  And do you k now 
s om ething?  As we s aw the fighting, the guar d just picked up his  r ifle and shot one right in the fac e.  
J us t like that.  Over  the potato.  It's som ething that you c an't imagine that other people c ould do this . 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Marty, 70 year s  ago, jus t a few weeks ago, you were liber ated in May
 
19
45.  Tell us  
about your  liberation.
 
> > MartinWeis s :  Ok , liber ation.  Liber ation in Guns kirc hen
 
--
 
again, we expec ted to be killed.  We 
knew the war was  over  for all purpos es .  Again, the rum or that they were going to exc hange us.
 

 
Any way, Gunskirc hen turned out to be wor s t than we ever  had before.  I don't know how but 
that's  what happened.  It was  like people wer e just walking out like liter ally the walking dead.  But ther e 
were als o a lot of people ther e fr om the Hungar ian labor  battalions .  Now, how did they get ther e?  
Well, the Hungar ians wer e retreating.  Instead of leaving you in Hungary, figur ed the war  is  over , let 
them go hom e or you go hom e, the Hungarians brought them into Gunskirchen.
 
 
So when I c am e there, ther e were a lot of people from Hungary.  Some of them  fr om our  area.  
Mos t of them ac tually were fr om  our  ar ea.  And gues s  who I r an into as s oon as  I got ther e?  Talk  about 

God guiding you.  My c ous in.  I was  with his  br other in Melk. We got s epar ated when we wer e 
evac uated.  Her e I run i
nto his  brother .  He c am e from  Hungary.  He had a c ouple of buddies .  They 
were in pretty good s hape c ompared to us .  But they only had a few barr ac ks there.  At night
 
--
 
all day 
we s tand outs ide.  At night we go in.  5,000 m en in a bar rack .  Now, think , 
5
,000
 m
en in a barr ack .  
When you walked in, they loc ked the door .  You could not move.  You were s tanding.  That's  just how 
you s pent your  night.  
 
 
In the m or ning you had to go outs ide.
  
Her e things ar e s o bad alr eady that people were 
literally falling do
wn.  I c ould give you m or e and more but it would jus t be one quick inc ident.  Ther e 
was  puddles .  It was s pring of the year .  There were s ome inadvertently walked into a puddle of water .  

It was n't deep by any means  but they would fall down in the m iddle of the puddle. We would walk by 
and they would go like this , reac h out.  By the way, their eyes  wer e not even open anym or e bec aus e 

they wer e in s uc h bad s hape.  They would r eac h for  help.  Gues s what.  Didn't help them.  
 
 
Why do you think we did that?  Bec aus e at that s tage we figur ed it was  better off to leave 
them a little while, 10, 20 minutes , and he'll be finis hed.  He wouldn't have to go on. We knew he was  
not going to m ake it anyway.  So we figured we would s horten
 
--
 
do them a favor to leave them 
alone. 
 
 
Fr om ther e, one day we find out there were guar ds  taking off.  Somebody s aid the Am eric ans 
were there but we didn't s ee any Am er ic ans.  So we were c ar eful.  We didn't want to walk 
out.  We 

13
 
 
thought it was a tr ick ;
 
we would go out the gate and m ac hi
ne guns  waiting for  us.  We were s o res igned 
that they would kill us .  Ok? 
 S
o we stayed an extra night believe it or not.  I'm  with m y c ous ins and 
fr iends .  I'm looking for  food.  
 
 
I'll jump bec aus e of the tim e.
  
We c am e into this  field. We s aw this Army truc k  in a ditc h.  
We 
inves tigated. We s aw this  tub of lard on the front s tr eet of the truck. We got very exc ited.  It had 

s om ething to do with food
.  W
hat ar e we going to do with lar d I don't k now.  But one of the guys , they 
were in fairly good s hape 
yet.  The one from  Hungary
, h
e took  his fist and right through
. T
he glas s  fell 
into the lard. 
 
 
So meantim e, we took  the lar d on the gras s , s c ooped out the
 
--
 
you know, c leaned it up and 
s aved the lar d.  Then we looked in the back  of the truck and found leather 
hide
.  They wer e refined 
alr eady, ready for us e.  We got r eally exc ited why?  Didn't have shoes, nothing.  We k new there 

wouldn't be any s hoes  because after the war there wouldn't be anything.  So we wer e exc ited.  Going to 
go to a s
hoemaker and he'll m ake us  s hoes . 
 
 
Now, in Eur ope, the s hoe
m aker s know how to make s hoes fr om s cr atc h.  When I was  a kid, 
we us ed to have our boots  m ade like that.  So we got
 
exc ited.  We have r olled up whatever we c ould 
c ar r y, which was n't that m any.  I was  very weak.
 
 
We s aw a farmhous e not far away.  We m arc hed up to the far mhous e.  Before we get to the 
farm hous e
 
--
 
I'll tell you this .  I'll s peak  for m ys elf.  I was  s o hateful, angr y, full of vengeance.  I r eally if 
s om ebody gave m e a pistol to s ee if the guy was  Germ an, I don't c are who he was , I would s hoot him  
or  I think  I c ould.
  
 
 
However, we got to the
 
farm hous e.  This  still bother s  m e in a way.  We c am e to the 
farm hou
s e.  Mind you, we had every right to be angr y.  They were not quite as  angr y as  I was  bec aus e 
their exper ienc e was  not quite the s am e as m ine was .  They s till didn't know what we went through.  

They didn't experienc e that. 
  
We k nocked on the door . We did
n't barge in.  And the lady c am e to the 
door .  She was  home alone.  She c am e to the door.  And she just opened the door  a little bit.  And all I 

c ould s ee
 
--
 
I was  s hor t so I c ould s ee jus t her face.  She asked the fellows what did we want.  So he 
as ked fo
r  s om e legs , flour  and water.  She went to the back  of the kitc hen, c am e back to the door  and 
gave it to us .  She had a barn in the backyar d.  Went to the backyard.  There was  one of thos e iron 

kettles that they us ed to heat water for the c ows .  Made a fir
e under it. We heated up the water.  One 
of the guys  m ixed up the m ixture.  And we us ed the lar d for that, too. We had dum plings .  That was  our 

fir s t meal.  
 
 
Let m e tell you s omething, luckily I ate only a c er tain am ount.  You have to r emember, when 
you're hungry, you don't as k .  If there's a hor s e in front of you, you eat the whole hor s e not half.  That's 
how you feel at the time.  But I had a c ertain s or t of s ens e or s om ething that told me n
ot to over
do it.  I 
was  fine.  One of the guys  met an unc le
 
of his and he was  older , about 50.  He was  c ons ider ed old.  He 
ate too muc h
 
and
 
a day or two later  
h
e died.  Then I found out thous ands  of people died when the 
Am eric ans  and Br itis h star ted feeding the people befor e they found out what killed them , they found out 

bec aus e they wer e s uffer ing from malnutr ition and they c ouldn't hold the food. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Marty, I was  glad that you m entioned the r age that you had bec aus e you didn't act on 
it.  And that was  s omething you s hared with m e.  Onc e you were li
ber ated
 
--
 
> > MartinWeis s :  The one thing I want to point out.  The r age, the r eas on I m entioned rage.  After  we 

finis hed eating, you know what happened?  One of the fellows  s ugges ted eac h one take s ome of the 
hide
s  and give it to the lady.  Not one of us
 
objec ted.  We just did exac tly that. We went back  to the 
door , gave it to the lady and thanked her.  Never enter ed the hous e.  
 

 
You know som ething?  I was  s peaking for the Mus eum for s ever al years  befor e I rem em ber ed 
this .  Now I always  like to inc lude it.  And I'll tell you s omething.  To this day I c annot under s tand that 
we ac ted the way we did.  Really, the r eas on I explain to you how full of r age I was  that in s pite of that, 
our  upbr inging c lic ked in.  And the only r eas on I'm proud we
 
ac ted that way
;  
I didn't feel human but I 
s till ac ted like a human being.  Stuff like that.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Marty, I think  our audienc e
 
--
 
you know we jus t got fr om Marty jus t a glim ps e, just a 
glim ps e.  He c overed year s  and things unimaginable in a s hor t tim e.  So I wis h we had m ore tim e to 

14
 
 
hear  m or e fr om Marty.  And als o about what happened next.  Cam e to the United States  in 1946 and 
built a new life, a family.  I wis h we c ould spend tim e with you today on that and we c an't.
 
 
I want to thank all of you for being her e.
  
I'm  going to do a couple o

One is
 
I'll thank  all of you and remind you that we have
 
Firs t Pers on

Marty, as  I mentioned ear lier , c ontr ibutes  to the mus eum 's  wr iting project for s ur vivors .  So he 
will leave the s tage when we're done and he will go
 
--
 
I'd like to get him up the ais le her e.  He'll be 
available to s ign copies of "Ec hoes  of m emory."  We didn't have a c hanc e for  questions  and ans wers  of 

Marty, s o that's an opportunity als o to chat with Marty onc e he's up there, if you wouldn't m ind that.
 
 
It's  our  tr adition at
 
First Per s on
 
that our firs t per s on gets the las t wor d.  So I'm  going to turn

when Mar ty's  done, he's  going to c ome up on the s tage.  I'm  going to ask  you all to s tand bec aus e 
he's  going to take a photogr aph of Marty with you as  the back gr ound.  It's  jus t a ter r ific photogr aph of 

Marty and you.  So we'll as k  him to do that onc e Mar ty's  done. 
 
 
I thank you all for  being her e.  
 
 
Marty? 
 
> > MartinWeis s :  Thank  you.  Thank  you, Bill. 
 
 
I have the last word.  I would like to s ay jus t a c ouple of things

a couple of lines . 
 
 
In c los ing, I would like to c all attention to the m as sac re of thos e nine people in South Car olina.  
The killer  of thos e nine innoc ent people, jus t bec aus e of hate.  He had to learn that s om ewher e, either  

fr om his fam ily or  his  c ultu
