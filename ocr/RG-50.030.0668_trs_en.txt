N:
No,
no,
no,
no,
this
is
very.
This
is
very
inter esting.
And
I™ m
asking
th ese
questions
because
I,
I
think
that
having
this
informati o n
is
descri ptive
of
a
family.
You
know,
you
can
bette r
und erstand
the
si tuation
of
a
family.
S:
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
N:
So,
they
spoke
Yiddish
a
mongst
the
m selves.
So,
would
you
say
that
your
mo ther™s
first
la nguage
was
Yiddish
or
something
else ?
S:
Well,
Polis h.
N:
It
was
Polish?
S:
Yeah,
bu t
after
she
married,
she
forgo t
it,
she
didn™ t
want
to
speak
it
anymore.
N:
But
does
that
mean
the y
were
speaking
Polish
at
home,
with,
in
Holland?
S:
First
at
ho
me
and
when
she
came
to
Holland
she
started
speaking
Dutch.
N:
Okay,
so
basically,
after
the
age
of
fo ur,
she
was
speaking–
S:
At
four
yea r s
old
she
ca me
to
Holland.
N:
Dutch.
Uh

So,
in

home,
wer e
they
speaking
Polish,
Dutch,
or
Yid
d
ish,
or
everything?
S:
Mmmmm–
I
would
say
Dutch.
Mayb e
my,
maybe
my
Oma
Ros a
and
Opa
Moshe
in
betw een
themselves
certainly
were
only
speaking
Yid dish.
But
I
think
with
the
childre n
they
were
only
speaking
Dutch.
N:
So,
does
that?
S:
None
of
my
un cles
on
my
father™s
side
or
my
mother™s
side,
non
e
of
th em
kn ew
Yid dish.
N:
I

Oka y .
So
then,
your

Mo she
and
Rosa,
they
would
not
have
known
Dutch
before
they
went
to
Holland?
Ri g h t?
S:
No.
No.
N:
Okay.
So
they
learned
Dutch
and
th ey
spoke
Dutch
with
th eir
own
chil dren.
Is
that
right?
S:
Yes.
Because
they
had
to
speak
Dutch
for
busin
ess
also.
So,

S:
Yes.
Did
yo ur
grandparents
also,
your
mater nal
gra ndparen ts
were
already
in
Holland,
the y
had
not
moved.
Did
your
paternal
grandparen ts,
well
your
mother,
your
g r andmother
I
suppose
ha d
passed
away
by
then
from
diab ete s ,
did
your
gr andfather
mo ve
with
you
to
Holland?
You
r
paternal
grandfather
.
S:
No.
No.
He
left
Ger many ,
I
think
only
in
39.
He
went
to
Bel gium
together
with
the
you nger
brother
of
my
father.
He
went
only
at
the
last
mi nu te,
I
must
say.
N:
Now,
you™ ve
already
tal ked
a
bit
abo ut
this,
bu t
I
want
to
get
bac
k
to
your
fa
mily
leaving
in
33.
Can
you
tell
me
more
about
how
they
felt
about
why
th ey
were
leaving?
Anything
co ncret e
that
they
said,
you
know?
There
was
a–
Maybe
ther e
was
an
event
that
they
de cided,
okay,
th is
is
it,
we™re
leaving.
Or,
how
did
th ey
come
to
that
decision?
S:
My
father
was
a
guy
who
always
saw,
looked
very
much
in
the
fu
t
ure.
My
father
in
1938,
39
uh,
when
there
was
stil l
no
war
in
H o lland.
He
wa nted
to
go
to
the
States.
He
had
thre e
sisters
in
the
states.
Um.
And
my
mo th er
did
n™t
want
to
go
be
cau s e
her
parents
were
living
in
Amsterdam.
In
1940,
my
father
was
very
good
fri ends
with
the
English
Cons ul,
and
uh,
th e
Germans
invaded
Holland
in
1940.
N:
Mhm .
S:
In
May.
N:
Yes.
S:
And
so
th e
consul
contac t
my
father
and
says,
ﬁBruno,
I™ve
bee n
your
guest
man
y
tim
es
no w.
You
are
my
gu est.
I
have
a
ship
leaving
Ams terdam
about
in
an
hour
from
now,
only
English
ci tiz ens.
You
will
be
the
only
peo ple
on
board
who
are
not
English
ci tize ns.ﬂ
That
boa t,
when
it
lef t
coast
in
Holl and,
it
struck
two
magn eti c
mines.
N:
Oh
my
goodness.
S:
Terrible.
Ev
erythin
g,
eve r ything
busts
and
breaks,
glass,
windows,
wash
basins.
Everything .
So,
we
went
back
to
the
port
in
H o lland.
N:
Are
you
saying
your
fa mily
was
on
that
ship?
S:
Yes,
we
were.
The
four
of
us.
We
went
in
th e
life boats.
Luckily
e nough
it
was
n™t
very
far
aw
ay
from
the
coast.
It
was
about
an
hour
rowing.
And
we
arriv ed
in
the
port
of
Em erd
[ph ],
that™s
the
port
of
Amsterdam,
and
uh,
stayed
about
two
hours,
and
my
father
is
very
impatient,
and
he
says,
ﬁLet™s
go
back
to
Ams t erdam.ﬂ
If
we
would
have
st
ayed
another
two
hours,
the
English
sent
another
ship
and
took
everybo dy
to
Engla nd .
My
life
story
would
have
been
totally
different.
N:
So,
he
di d n™t
wait
for
the
second
bo at,
you™re
saying?
S:
No,
my
father
was
not.
No,
my
father
was
not
the
kind
of
guy
to
wait
for
thi
ngs.
Because
1942,
when
the
Ger mans
started
depor ting
Jews
in
H o lland,
he
wa s
the
first
one
to
leave
Hol land.
My
story™s
long.

N:
I
know
you™re
story™s
long.
I
want
to
bring
you
back
beca use
I
thi nk
we™re
jumping
ahead
so
much.
But
before
I
take
you
back,
do
you
know
what
th e
na me
was
of
the
Bri tish
consu l
that
said,
ﬁYou
are
now
my
guests.ﬂ?
S:
No.
No.
N:
You
don™t
know
the
name.
Do
you
kn
ow
the
nam
e
of
th e
boat
that
struck
the
min es?
S:
Re nselaer.
N:
Can
you
spell
that?
S:

N:
Mhm .
Wo uld
you
know
what
the
second
boat
was ,
that
he
didn™t
wait
for?
S:
No.
N:
Ok
ay.
S:
Because
we
took
off,
so
we
wouldn™
t
know.
N:
So,
le t™s
ge t
ba ck
from
1 940
because
we
have
to
ta lk
about
the
time
between
33
and
40.
So ,
getting
back
to
my
question,
you
said
that
your
father
alwa ys
looked
ahead.
So,
but
was
there
something
that
pushed
him
to
leave,
or
ha
d
he
bee
n
thi nking
about
it
duri ng
the
year?
I
realize
you
were
only
four
years
old.
S:
He
was
afraid
of
Hitl er
and
he
wanted
to
get
away
as
far
as
possible
from
hi m.
W hich
wa sn™t,
which,
which
in
Holl and
was
not
the
case
be ca use
Holland
is
a
neig
hbor
of
Germany
.
N:
Yes,
do
you
know
why
they
chose
Ho lland?
S:
Because
my
mother,
be cause
my
mo ther™s
paren t s
lived
there.
N:
Do
you
kn ow
whether
they,
th ey
too k
their
valuables,
the
worth
of
their
property,
their
business,
were
they
able
to
li quida te
the
factory?
S:
No,
I
know
my
father
to
ok
some
of
the
money
of
the
factory
and
of
my
gran dfather
took
away
to
Holland.
And
the
German™s
discovered
it
and
la ter
he
had
to
send
it
back
to
Ger many.
N:
So,
he
too k
some
of
the
value
of
the
factory
and
then
he
had
to
send
it
ba
ck?
S:
Sen
d
it
back.
N:
Wh–?
S:
Look,
th ey
worked
hard
for
a
couple
of
years
to
start
a,
to
build
up
the i r
business.
It
was
li fe
at
the
time.

N:
Do
you
kn ow,
do
you
know
when
he
had
to
send
back
the
mon ey?
S:
No.
I
think
it
was
two
or
three
years
later.
N:
So,
mayb e
35,
36?
S:
Yeah,
something
li ke
th at.
N:
And,
you
said
tha t
your
father
ha d
a
brother
and
he
was
a
junior
partner.
W
h
ere,
di d
he
stay
in
Germany
or
did
he
leave?
S:
No,
no,
my
grandfather
and
his
younger
son
Josef
went
to
Belgi um
in
1933.
About
a
year
before
th e
Germans
inv a ded
Belgium.
N:
39.
S:
And
they
went
in
39.
And
in
1940,
th e
Germans
invaded
Belgium,
Holland
and
Fran
ce.
N:
Mhm .
Mh m.
So,
betwe en
33
and
39,
is
your
father
comm uni cating
with
his
father
and
his
brother?
Are
th ey
e xch anging
letters?
S:
Probably,
probably.
But
I
wouldn™t
kn ow
the
detail s.
N:
Was
your
father
keepi n g
up
with
what
was
happ e ning
in
Ger m any?
Did
he
ever
talk
about
it?
S:
Yes,
yes.
Yes,
of
course.
I
mean,
it
wa
s
in
all
the
pa pers
all
over
Europe.
You
had
it
in
Belgium.
You
had
it
in
Fran ce.
Everybody
kn e w
the
proble ms
with
Ger many.
N:
Sur e,
bu t
what
I™m
inte rested
in
is
how
this
played
out
in
your
family.
So,
was
it
a
topic
of
conversation?
S:
No.
No.
Not
with
us
chil
dren.
N:
I
see.
S:
Th ere
migh t
have
bee n
conversation
betwee n
my
parents
the m selves
and
maybe
with
their
friends,
but
not
with
us.
N:
And
when
you
were
growing
up
before
th e
war
in
Holland,
um,
did
you.
Okay.
Here™s
the
quest
ion.
What
identi ty
did
you
hav e?
How
di d
you
feel
about
yourself?
Were
you
a
Ger man
Jewish
boy
in
Holland?
Wer e
you
a
Dutch
boy?
S:
I
f elt,
no,
I
felt
li ke
a
Jew ish
boy
with
no
nationality.
At
tha t
time
we
didn™ t
have
passports
beca use
we
were
stateless.
N:
Mhm
.
S:
We
were
stateless
for
a
lon
g
ti me.
But
that™s
another
story?
You
know
what
stateless
is?

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0668 
21
 
21
N:
Absolutely .
Um,
so,
did
your
parents
have
any
kind
of
ide nti ty
papers
duri n g
th e
30s?
S:
Oh,
yes,
th ey
were
residents
in
Holland.
And
they
had
a
factory
and
they
paid
taxes.
The
factory
made
profit
and
th ey
paid
taxes.
And
th ey
pai d
tax es
on
th eir
private
income
from
th
e
factory–
N:
Mhm .
S:
and
th ey
were,
they
wer e,
with
th e
e x ception
of
the
nationali ty,
they
were
li ke
Dutch
cit i ze ns.
N:
What
lang uage
di d
your
parents
speak
at
home
with
you?
S:
On ly
Dutch.
After
th ey
le ft
Germany,
they
nev er
again
spoke
Ger many.
They
only
started
speaking
Germany
aga in
when
we
i
mmigrated
in
1947
to
uh,
to
New
York.
Because
uh,
my
three
aunts
ther e,
they
spoke
half
th e
ti me
Engl ish
with
us,
half
the
ti me,
Ge rman.
N:
And
why
is
it
that
th ey
s topped
speaking
German
in
Holland?
S:
Because
my
father
terrible
ha te
of
Hi tler
and
Ger many.
I
never
,
after
the
Se cond
World
War
ends,
finish
about
1 944,
I
went,
I
been
going
all
over
Europ e
beca use,
uh,
I
live
in
Brazil
since
51,
all
over
Europe,
espe cially
for
business,
becaus e
we
were
in
the
che mical
import
busin ess.
I
went
to
Russia,
I
went
to
Denmark,
went
to
Poland,
to
Hungary,
uh
,
but
I
never
went
back
to
Germany.
N:
So,
your
parents
imparted
this
feeli n g
about
Germany
onto
you?
S:
Yes.
Th ey
d idn™t
want
to
speak
German.
Only
when
they
arrived
in
the
States
did
they
start
to
speak
a
little
bit
Ger man.
Then
la ter
on,
they
went
to
live
in
Swi
tzerlan
d .
Because
my
father
was
di abetic
also.
Because
I
tol d
you
it
come s
through
the
moth er™s
side.
My
youn ge r
brother
was
also
diabeti c.
Uh,
Yi ch,
when
we
came
to
Brazil
in
1951,
my
parents
arrived
in
54,
thre e
years
later.
We
worked
together
in
business,
my
father,
also.
And,
the
diabetes
of
my
fa
ther
was
getting
worse
because
he
ma de
a
very
big
mistake
of
no t
taki ng
insuli n
inje ctions.
He
only
wa nted
to
take
pill s.
In
1969,
th e
house
doctor,
my
father
tol d
hi m,
ﬁListen,
Br uno,
you
in
the
wrong
bus iness
be cause
of
your
business
we
alwa yshave
all
these
proble
ms,
and
probl
ems
are
bad
for
diabeti c
people.
You
go
to
live
in
Swi tzerland .ﬂ
And
in
69,
they
went
to
live
in
Switze rland.
And
th ere
again,
of
course,
they
start
speaking
German
again.
N:
Mhm
S:
Tha t™s
where
I
lear ned
my
five
la ngu ages,
in
that
way.
Because
in
Holland,
I
le
arned
Dutch,
then
we
were
hi
dden
in
Belgium,
during
the
war,
and
at
th e
Be lgian
ly ceum,
you
know
what
lyce um
is,
middle
school,
high
school,
I
mean ,
we
had
to
ta ke
four,
five
l a nguages.
So,
Dutch
and
Fr ench
were
th e
main
languages
of
Belgium
at
th e
ti me.
So,
at
school,
I
lear ned
Engl
ish
and
especially,
Ger man
grammar.
One
of
the
worst
grammars
in
the
world
is
German .
N:
It™s
true.
S:
Fren ch
is
difficult.
The
German
is
mu ch
worse.
Irregular
verbs
in
Fren ch
are
n o thing.
But
th e
Germans,
there
(tape

has
three
conjugations.

So,

in
Holland,

S:
On ly

N:
No

S:
No
Yiddish .
And
all
the
fr iends
of
my

in
be

Some
of
my

thi nk
two

were

in

And

my.
Th e

of
my

Holland,
uh,
and
she
also

N:
And
you
only

Or

S:
You

Sibling
in
which

N:

S:
I

of,
of
rubber
or
wha tever.
The
ela s tic.
And
my
father
sewed
them.
N:
Uh
huh.
Uh
hu h.
S:
And
later
on
th ey
go t
more
employe es.
But,
the
first
two
or
three
years,
th e y
worked
long,
they
worked
long,
from
8
in
th
e
morning
un til
6
or
7
at
ni g ht.
N:
Wow.
And
what
kin d
of
traditions
did
they
ke ep?
S:
Orthodox.
N:
So,
it
was
Orthodox
at
home.
S:
Kosher,
we
made
abdall a
Saturday
ni ght.
You
kno w
what
abdal la
is?
N:
Yes.
S:
We
had
Ki ddush
on
Frid ay
evening,
challah
and
ev
erything.
N:
Um.
Did
you
go
to
a
religious
school?
S:
No,
a
publi c
school.
Two
very
pu blic
s chools.
On e
was
called
Da lton™s.
Dalton™s
School,
which
was
a
system,
you
know,
I
don™t
if
you
ever
he ard
of
Montessori?
N:
Yes,
I
di d.
S:
It
was
not
a
school
of
di
stance.
And
I
went
to
Dalto
n™s
School
and
I
write
in
bl ocks.
I
don™t
write
in
flowing
le tter s .
N:
So,
why,
what
is
the
adv a ntage
of
wri ting
in
blocks ?
Or
why
di d
they?
S:
I
had,
this
is
what
I
was
taught
in
school.
I
don™ t
know
Mr.
Dalton
at
all.
He
invented
tha
t.
The
problem
is,
that
if
you
write
in
blo
ck s
like
this,
as
you
do
in
th e
Dalton
School,
my
school
friend,
he
coul d
imi tate
my
signature
as
well
as
I
co uld
i mitate
hi s.
N:
So,
why
di d
your
pare nts
choose
to
put
you
in
something
that
s
o
unds
like
maybe
some,
not
very
conservative
type
of
s chool
for
the
ti me ?
Certainly
alternative.
Or
new.
Or
diff e r ent.
S:
Because
it
was
in
that
n eighborhood.
There
were
two
schools.
Dalton™s
Schoo l
and
Montessori
school.
You
had
to
choose
betwee n
one
of
the
two.
Why
the y
chose
Dalto n™s
School,
I
don
™t
reme
mb er.
N:
But
why
di d
th ey?
S:
I
don™t
remember
of
hav ing
any
pu bli c
schools.
N:
I
see.
So
th ere
was
no
accessible
publi c
school.
S:
No,
not
in
our
neig hborhood.
May be
in
other
parts
of
town,
yes,
I
wouldn™t
know.

N:
And
can
you
tell
me
a
li ttle
more
abo ut
this
Dalton
School,
what
other
special ties
di d
it
hav e,
aside
from
block
le tter
writing?
S:
Uh.
No,
no,
it™s
not
a
blo ck
letter.
Thei r
teaching
system
modern,
they
taug ht
a
littl e
bit
of
e v erything .
It
was
the
same,
at
the
Montessori,
it
would
be
the
same.
I
thi
nk
that
the
tea
c hing
system
wouldn™t
be
very
mu ch
dif f erent
from
any
other
tea c hing
system
at
that
time
in
Holland.
N:
Um,
so
yo u
said,
you
would
go
to
school
by
yours elf.
You
were
able
to
walk
by
yourself?
S:
Yes.
N:
Okay.
Did
your,
uh,
bro
t
her,
who
was
already
bor n
there,
was
he
going
to
school
th ere
a
few
years
later?
Was
there
a
ki nder g arten?
S:
Mmmm–
One
min ute,
one
min ute .
We
left.
He
migh t
have
gone,
but
I
can not
remember.
I
don™t
think,
no,
there
was
no
ki ndergarten.
N:
Now,
aside
from
Marg
o t,
I
hope
I™m
pronouncing
her
name
co
rrectly,
did
you
have
any
other
people
helping
around
the
house ?
Was
ther e
a
cook?
Or?
S:
No,
no,
Because
Margo t
used
to
cook,
used
to
cl ean,
used
to
go
shopping,
I
used
to
go
to
the
mark et
with
her
to
go
shopping,
an
d
she
was
the
only
one.
N:
Now
you,
of
course,
said
a
couple
of
times
that
your
mother
wa s
working.
Do
you
know
whether
she
had
to
work?
Or
she
chose
to
work?
S:
She
proba bly
choose
to
work,
bu t
uh,
again,
in
Bernarach
[ ph]
she
had
no
other
choice.
I
mean,
she
had
to
help.
It
was
the
beg
i
nning
of
their
life.
N:Mh m.
Mhm.
Mh m.
S:
Of
the i r
business
life,
let™s
say.
N:
Did
she
at
one
point
sto p
working,
when
they
wer e
be tter
off?
S:
Yes,
yes,
yes.
I
thi nk
she
worked
about,
I
woul dn™t
know,
four
to
five
years,
th
ree
to
four
years.
You
don™t
work
all,
at
the
time
when
the
factory
beca me
big
and
more
people
cam e
to
work,
she
stopped
working.
N:
So,
how
many
people
were
working
at
that
fa ctory ?
At
the
Beutel
[p h]
fa ctor y?
S:
I
think
between
20
and
30.
N:
And
this
was
around
what
year,
they
had
that
man
y
people?
S:
Uh.
I
think
after
four
or
five
years,
and
the n
til
1942
when
we
left.
N:
Okay.
So,
it
would
have
been
that
ma ny
peopl e
already
in
38,
39?

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0668 
26
 
26
S:
Yes.
N:
Okay.
And
um,
ca n
you
tell
me
a
li ttle
about
your
parent™s
friends?
Did
th ey
s o cialize?
Did
people
come
over
fo r
dinn er?
Or
card
games
or
tea?
S:
Oh,
yes.
No,
it
was
mor e
th ey
went
out
toge ther
at
nig ht.
Went
to
have
coff ee,
or
to
a
vegico
[
ph],
to
a
conc
ert
or
a
theat er
pla y .
And
it
took,
I.
House
visits
maybe
two ,
three
ti mes
a
year.
But,
not,
not,
not
on
a
weekly
basis,
I™d
say.
N:
And
when
they
went
to
a
conc ert,
what
kin d
of
mu sic
was
it?
S:
I
don™t
kno w .
N:
You
don™t
know.
Um,
do
you
know
whether
their
friends
came
from
a
cert
ain
cir cle?
How,
you
know,
where
wer e
they
socializi n g?
What
typ e
of
friends
di d
th ey
have?
S:
Well,
um,
mostly
Jew ish
friends.
My
father
had
about
one
or
two
Dutch
business
friends
that
they
see,
but
ah,
I
thi
n k
that
the
socializing
was
only
be
twee n
themselves
and
between
Jews.
I
would
say
that
their,
their
Je wish
friend
ci rcle
must
have
bee n
between
8
and
10
different
peopl e.
N:
And
so,
no t
really
many
gentil e
friends?
S:
No,
none
whatsoever.
N:
Oh,
none
whatsoever.
Okay.
Um,
I
don™t
know
if
I
asked
this
be
fore,
but
Mar go t
was
not
Jewish,
right?
S:
Excuse
me.
Who
was
no t
Jewish?
N:
Margo t?
S:
No,
Margo t
was
not,
no.
N:
Mhm .
Mh m.
A nd,
um,
so,
when
you
went
to
the
Dalton
School,
I
suppose
there
wer e
Jewish
boys
and
non
r
Jewish
boys?
S:
Yes,
of
cou
rse.
N:
And–
S:
You
know
who
was
my
old
mate
in
Dalton
School?
N:
Who?
S:
I™m
so
sure
you
know
he r
name.
N:
I
don™t

N:
Really?
S:
Yes.
N:
Yes,
I
certainly

S:
She

about
three

behin d

N:
Really?
W ell,
what
do
you
reme mbe r
about
her?
S:
She
had
da rk
hair.
She
had
dark
eyes.
What
can
I
re memb er
at
that
age
of
a
girl?
N:
I
don™t

Was
she
quiet?
Was
she
misbehaving?
S:
I
woul dn™t

There
wer e
about
20
r
25
people
in
my

N:
Ah

Ah

So,
I
kn ow
this
is
a
strange
question,
bu t,
how
do
you

S:
Ah,
becaus e
I

When

N:

As

in
a

46.
No t
in

be cau s e

Se pte mber
1944.
The
small
detail,
that™s
not
important
but
it™s
interesti ng.
My

Brussels
at
that

safer.
Uh–
N:
I™m

apartments.
N:
Se parate

So,
at
th e
ho use
my

was
living,
there
was
a,
to
go
out,
you
had
to
go
do
wn
about
3
or
4
steps.
So
when
the
English
mar che d
in
in
Sep te mber,
he
was
so
happy,
he
forgot
the

steps.
He
fell,

N:

and
next

of
our

was
a
canal
which
in
winter
froze
completely .
So,
all
winter

I
used
to

But
in
Belgium,
in
H

fa mily.
S:
He
took
in
my
paren ts
one
or
two
nig hts
to
sleep
bec
ause
they
had
no
place
to
go.
N:
And
so
why
was
this,
were
they
already
on
root
to
Belgium?
Or?
S:
No,
we
fled
in
1942,
uh,
uh
to
Brussels
because
th e r e
was
some body
th ere
who
was
to
ta k e
us
ba ck
out
to
Switze rland.
And
th en
we
were
betrayed
by
a
Jew
in
Belgi
u
m
who
knew
many
people.
N:
Okay,
so
what,
first,
my
first
question
is,
what
mad e
your
father
decid e
to
flee
exactly
in
42 ?
S:
Well,
beca use
Belgium
was
occupi ed
also.
N:
No,
but
what
di d,
flee
from
Holland.
S:
Because
he
knew
that
th e
de portation s
were
going
to
start
in
Jul
y
,
so
we
left
in
June.
N:
And
how
did
he
know
th at?
S:
I
don™t
kno w .
N:
Mhm .
Did
he,
did
he
tal k
about
this,
did
he
say,
ﬁThis
is
why
we
are
leaving?ﬂ
Or
did
he
just?
S:
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
No.
No.
We
wer
e
children
at
tha
t
ti me
you
know.
And
th ey
were
people.
And
my
parents
sort
of
said
as
less
as
possible
because
you
never
know
if
the
Germans
would
arrest
or
something,
arresting
you,
the
better
it
was.
We
were
in
42,
we
were
arrested
by
the
Devisensc hutzkomman do
(Foreign
Currency
Control
Administra
tion).
Which
wa
s
a
branch
of
the
Ger man
government
to
protect
for eign
exchange.
And,
I,
I
was
examine d
by
two
Ger mans
when
they
arrested
us
for
about
three,
four
ho urs
and
I
always
denied
everything.
Then
la ter
on,
my
father
ca me
in
and
tol d
me,
ﬁYou
can
answer
no
w.ﬂ
I
d
 idn™t
know
everything.
Then
my
father
made
an
agreement
with
the m
that
he
would
give
them
the
mon ey
he
had
in
Swi tzerlan d
if
they
would
let
us
go
to
Switzerla nd.
Instead
of
tha t,
th ey
sent
us
back
on
the
train
to
Holland
with
two
Ger man
air
force
officers.
And
when
we
arrived
in
Amsterdam,
excuse
me,
the
Hague,
the
capi
tol,
my
father
asked
them
coul
d
leave
the
tr ain
and
we
children
had
to
go
to
the
to ilet.
And
so
they
said
we
could
leave
the
trai n.
The
train
was
sto pped
in
the
station.
They
probably
knew
we
wer e
going
to
run
away.
So,
we
ran
away
and
we
went
to
that
uh
,
that
hou
s e.
My
par ents
stayed
there.
A nd,
I
don™t
know
how
they
arranged
it,
my
brother
and
I,
we
were
in
Haarlem,
which
is
a
small
to wn
near
Amsterdam.
We
stayed
th ere
six
month s .
We
wer e
in
a
small
mate
rnity
of
about
12
or
14
bedrooms.
And
we
stayed
six
months,
we
stayed
in
Holland.
And
we
never
went
in
the
street.
We
always
stayed
inside
the
ho use.

In

And

It

a

If

You

Actually,

No,
but
he

4.5
years

8
years

What

and
I

I

In

During

a

N:
How

you

about
that?
S:
I
had
to

I
ha d
no
way .
Th ere
was
nothing
to

about.
N:
Nothing
to
feel,
you

had
to
go.
But
it

I
s
u
ppose
it
was
unfamiliar
and
you

the

I
mea n,
how–
how ?
S:
Well,
we

N:
Mhm
S:
Th ere
we

to
confession.
N:
How

you
di
dn™t
go
to
confession
at
the
orphanage?
S:
May

Abbe
Andre
had
arranged
it
in
tha t
way.
But
at
Malo nn e,
only
two
people
in
the
whole
colle ge
who
knew
we
were
Jews.
It
was
the
ge neral
dire ctor
and
the
guy
to
whom
you
went
to
ma k e
confession
because
we
d idn™t
make
co
nfession.
We
spoke
about,
about
school
things
and
thi
ngs
like
that.
Let
me
go
back
to
Malonne
because
Malonne
is
much
more
i nteresting
than
the
orphana ge.
N:
But
we
will
talk
about
both.
Yes,
okay,
go
ahead.
S:
Malonne
was
a
school
of

At

N:

S:
When
we,
in

when
we
went
across

N:
So,
after

s
of

when

I
don™t

N:
And
he
said,
it
doesn™t

tha t
it™s
not

S:
No,

it

N:
Okay.
He
just
said
ea t

And

that
that

A nd,

Okay,
well
let™s
go
ba ck
a
little
bit
to
Malonne .
What
were
your
activities
in
Malonne,
besides
your
studies
w hich
really
impres sed
you,
and
the
level
of

S:
I
think
we
had
gy mnasti c
lessons.
N:
What
ki nd
of
gymnasti cs?
S:
General
gy mnastics.
Yo u
know,
bars
and
stuff
like

May

I
don™t

N:
Were
you
good
at
that?
S:
I
don™t

N:
Mhm .
S:
I
don™t

I
don™ t

I
even
don™t
remember
mu ch,
probably
had
gy mnasti cs,
but
I
have
no,
I
ha ve
no
re colle ction
of
it.
Th e
rest
of
the
time,
we
had
to
study
a
lot.
Because
they,
they
were
very
hard
on
the
studies.
Th
ey
would
gi
ve
you
lessons
in
the
morning
and
then
you
had
to
study
all
afternoon.
There
wasn™t
much
ti me
lef t
over.
N:
Did
you
ha ve
any
frien d s hips
with
anyone?
S:
No.
N:
Was
it
all
boys?
S:
Yes.
N:
And
in
the
orphanage
did
you
have
any
friendships
with
an
yone?
S:
No,
not
either.
N:
And
that
was
all
boys
too?
S:
On ly
boys.
N:
And
wha t
were?
S:
Because
th e
Catholics
don™t
mi x
sexes.
N:
Ri ght,
right,
right.
And
what
were
yo
ur,
was
there
any
reason
why
you
wer en™t
having
fr iendships?
S:
No,
I
did n™t
look
for
friendship
becaus e
it
was
a
wa y
of
prote ct
y o urself.
N:
Okay.
So
this
was
a
way
of,
a
very,
you
were
aware
of
it
and
you
were
not
ma king
fri ends
for
this
reason.
S:
Oh,
yes,
of
course
I
was
aware.
I
was,
you
had
to
act
accordingly
and
friendships,
uh.
To
be
by
yourself.
And
no
friends.
It™s
safer.

me
th e
address
where
to
bring
it.
And
more
than
once,
I
was
stopped
by
German
soldiers.
N:
Mhm .
S:
Pushed
you
against
th e
wall,
you
hav e
about
thre e
soldiers
behi nd
you
with
ar
ms,
but
th
ey
never
looked
inside
my
shoes.
N:
And
they
never
made
you
un dress?
S:
No.
They
touched
the
body,
but
uh,
the
arms,
and
the
sto mach
and
the
legs,
but
they
nev er
looked
in
the
shoes.
N:
Mhm .
So
your
father
as ked
you
to
do
this,
did
he
say
where
you
were
takin
g
these
things?
S:
Well,
he
gave
me
th e
address
where
to
deliver
the m
of
course .
N:
And
he
di d n™t
give
you
any
con tex t?
Did
he
give
you
a
name
that
you
were
s upposed
to
gi ve
these
things
to?
S:
I
don™t
remember.
He
to ld
me
to
go
there,
del
iver
to,
this
I
don™
t
remember.
Probably
at
the
addr ess
where
you
ring
the
bell,
the
guy
who
opens
the
door
is
probably
the
guy
who
wants
to
have
th e
docume nts.
N:
So,
when
you
would
deli ver
one
of
th ese
thi ngs.
He
opens
the
door.
What
do
you
say?
I
suppose
you
have
to
go
inside
to
take
your
shoes
off,
right?
S:
Uh,
good
qu
est
ion,
but
no
me mory.
N:
No.
Um.

S:
No,
probab ly
guy,
when
he
saw
a
young
boy
ther e,
he
probably.
Maybe
some body
told
hi m
a
young
boy
going
to
come,
so
he
probably
already
knew
bef o rehand.
N:
So,
when
your,
do
you
know
why
your
father
was
asking
you
to
make
these
deliveries?
S:
Yes,
to
hel p
peopl
e
who
nee
d
false
i d entiti es.
N:
And
how
come
as
a
person
who
him s elf
is
obviously
in
dan ger
and
is
hidde n,
how
is
he
actually
active
in
this?
How
does
he
beco me
active
in
this?
S:
Because
he
had
conta ct
apparently
with
A bbe
Andr e.
But
I
don™t
know
the
rea s on
or
the
de
tails.
N:
Mhm .
So,
so
basically
he
just
came
to
you
and
said
I
need
you
to
make
this
delivery.
S:
Yeah,
he
says
go
and
bri ng
this
there
and
there
and
he
told
me
where
to
pu t
it.
N:
And
how
big
was
it?
Did
it
fit
in
your
sh
oe?
S:
Yes.
Yeah,
it
just
wasn™t
comfortable,
but
the
dista nce
was
not
very
far.
But
it
was
no
probl em.
N:
And
how
many
ti mes
did
you
have
to
make
these
deliveries?
S:
Oh,
I
don™t
remember.
Half
a
dozen
ti mes,
maybe
less.
N:
Mhm .
Mh m.
And
how
many
ti
mes
were
you
sto
pped?
S:
About
once
or
twi ce.
N:
And
they
d idn™t
find
a ny thing .
And
th ey
let
you
go.
S:
Yeah .
N:
What
was
it
like–?
S:
I
wasn™t
the
only
one
who
was
stopped.
There
wa s
a,
there
wa s
a
line.
About
three,
four
people
standing
on
li ne
so
they
took
one
and
the
nex
t
guy
an
d
the
next
guy,
etc.
N:
What
wer e
you
thinking
when
you
got
stopped?
How?
What,
what
was
crossing
your
mi nd?
S:
Mmmm–
You
ge t
worried
that
uh,
you
get
worried,
bu t
you
try
to
cal m
your self.
N:
How?
S:
By
ke eping,
by
ke
eping
calm.
N:
Okay.
S:
There,
ah,
there
is
no
other
way.
N:
So,
so
wha t™s
curious
to
me
is
that
th i s
is
after
your
father
got
ca ught
and
went
to
the
Gestapo,
right?

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0668

S:
Which
I
didn™t
know
at
that
ti me.
N:
Which
you
didn™ t
eve n
know.
But.
S:
I
only
knew
that
after
we
were
liber ated
by
the
English.
N:
And
you
had
said
that
after
that
he
gets
worried
and
he
lives
separately
from
your
mother
as
a
precau tion.
He
doesn™t
go
outside
as
a
precau
tion.
So,
after
all
of
these
things,
how
come
he
asks
his
own
son
to
go
out
and
ma ke
a
dangero us
delivery?
S:
Story
of
Abraham
and
Is aac,
I
would
say.
N:
Yes?
Why?
S:
Look,
it
ha d
to
be
done.
Somebody
had
to
do
it.
N:
And
why
was
it
you
and
not
him?
S:
I,
bec
au
se
he
di dn™t
go
out
in
th e
str eet.
N:
But
for
th e
same
reason,
I
mea n
you
could
have
gotten–
S:
No,
no,
but
when
we
ca me
ba ck
from
Malonne
we
went
out
on
the
streets
in
Brussels.
Us
two
childre
n.
Because
about
three
or
four
blocks
away
from
the
apartment
where
we
lived
to
go
to
my
mother
or
to
my
father,
mostly
to
my
mother™s
house .
N:
So
you
were
already
in
the
practi ce
of
going
out
on
the
street?
S:
Yes,
yes.
N:
And
you
were
not
unde r
suspicion.
How
often
wo
uld
you
visit
your
mother?
S:
May be
once
a
week,
but
I
really
don™t
know.
N:
And
di d
yo u
visit
your
father
at
all?
S:
Much
less,
but
I
don™ t
re memb er

I

we
used
to
eat
at
the
house
where
we
were

N:
Mhm .
Was
ther

S:
Yes.
N:
Mhm .
Did
Abbe
A ndre
ever
wear
civili an

Li ke
you
know,
not
priestly
clothes?
S:
Not
to
my
knowledge .
N:
Did
your,
do
you
think
at
th e
time,
did
your
pare n ts
or
your
father,
did
he
have
certai n
political
inclina tions
or
not?

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0668

S:
No.
N:
Political
beliefs?
S:
No.
I
don™ t
think
he
ever
belonged
to
a
political
par ty.
No t

when

not
even
when

I

I

tha t
my

You

N:
Yea h,

S:
My

My

when

th ey
didn™t

And
in

they
didn™t

either.
N:
Were

the
orpha nage
or
in
Malonne,
were
they,
were
any
of

S:
So,
the

they
were
all
Belgian.
N:
Th ey

all
Belgian,
as

He

You

There

in
this

after
Malonne
where
at
that

you

How
many

I

abo ut
three,
four
months.
N:
Thr ee,
four
months
and
then

S:
Th
e
British
arrived
in

of

N:
So,
that

four

befo re

It
must
hav e
bee n
Marc h,
April
that

I
would
say
he

Maybe
he
was
with
my

I
cannot
r eme mber.
N:
And
the

I

N:
So
your

Fur

N:
So,

bought
a

already
in
19 46?
S:
I
think
in

already.
N:
So
how,
I™m
just
really
curious,
how
is
it
that
he
still

S:

N:
In

Holland
as

He
got

Only

By

It

First,
throu

my

In

But

S:
I
went
to

but
later

I
went
to
the

I
worked,
bu t
I
went

We
lived
in
Forest
Hills.
Nea r ,
you

the
tennis
s tadium
in
Forest
Hills?
N:
No.
S:
No.
I
think
now,
it
is
not
a

stadium
anymore.
I
think
now
the

one
is
in,
near
La
Guardia
airport.
Uh,
I
forgot
the
na

Very
bi g.
N:
So,

were,
you
were
selling
furs
on
your
summer
vacation
starting
when
you
were
15?
S:
Yeah,
for
about
one
or
two
years.
Th en
my

saw
it

not

You

N:
No,

N:
Ah.

S:

The
fur
busin ess
was
not
a
good
business,
no.
So
he
went
in
t
o
the
nylon
stocking
business.
And
later
on,
we
cam e
to
Ne w
York,
he
went
into
nylon
stocking
and
nylon
yarn.
Because
nylon
was
a
very
hot
object
in
Europe
at
that

N:
Nylon

In

N:

S:
It

and
I,
we
had
.
You
know
the
entry
admissions
were
made
by
co
untry
of
birth
not
by

N:
Uh

S:
So,
my
father
from
Germ any,
and
I
and
Ja ck,
Holland,
we
had
no
problem
getti ng
an
immigr ation
quota.
My
mother
was
fro m
Poland,
there
were
ma ny
peopl e
in

N:
Uh
huh.
S:
So,
we
had
to
wait
thr
e
e
years
un til
she
got
her

So,
in
1947
we
went
to
New

N:
So,
this
means
your
father
already
wanted
to
go
to
America
immediate ly
after
th e
war
in
45.
S:
Yes,
but
he
could n™t
because
of
my
mother.
N:
Now,
why

why
did
he
want
to

Belgium?
S:
Well,
wh

would
he
stay
after
the
war?
N:
I–
S:
Ma ny
people

N:
But
some
people
stayed.
So
what
was
his
idea,
why
did
he
wa nt
to
leave?
S:
He
did n™t
want
to
stay
in
Europe.
N:
Why?
S:
Why?
I
don

t
know.
He
never
said.
N:
And
you

S:
Ma ny
people
left
Europe,
Noemi.
N:
Sur e,

S:
Sure,
peopl e
did n™t

People
who

were
ma ybe
youn ger
people
or
people
who
came,
people
who
went
to
Portugal,
went
to
Jamai ca ,
went
to
Cuba.
My,
my
uh,
my
sister,
the
brother
of
my
mother,
he
went
to
Ar
genti

I
hav e
cousins
all
over
the

N:
Mhm .

I

In

In

the

N:
Well,

so
some.
S:
South
Africa,
my
oldest
brother
of
my
father
went
to
Sou
t
h
Africa
in
194–
N:
Well,
so,
this
is
interesting
because
you
have
a
cousin
who
nev er
wanted
to
leave
Ger ma ny,
so,
but
your
father
wanted
to
leav e.
Did
he,
did
he
express
some
kind
of?
S:
He
did n™t
want
to
be
in
Ger many
after
th e

We
were
libera
t
ed,
my

wanted
to
send
the

to

Leipzig,
w hich
was
at
that

Russ ian
territory.
N:
Yes.
S:
And
he
di d n™t
want
to
go.
Go
explain
why.
I
don™t
know.
N:
And
why
did
your
father
want
to
com e
to
A merica
and
not
all
th
ese
other
des
tinations?
Li ke
maybe
Argenti na
or
Cuba
or?
S:
Because
A merica
at
that
ti me
was
a
free
cou ntry.
Look,
Argenti na
and
Brazil
only
came
away,
their
own.
In
1950
when
the
wa r
with
Korea
started
beco ming
worse,
you
know
at
that
ti me,
the r e
was
no
free
conscri p tion
army.
N:
Mhm .
S:
I
mean
you
went,
you
wan
t
ed
to
go
to
the
army,
you
went
ther e.
But
at
my
time,
you
were

if
you
were
not

If
you
lived
there,
uh,
you
pay
ta xes
ther e,
you
had
to
go.
N:
Mhm .
Mh m.
S:
So,
I
went
twice,
and
I
go
t
twi
ce
I
go t
a
4F.
4F
is
a
medical
defer ment.
I
did n™t
want
to

My

he
was

I

I

So
your

But
she

She

She

N:
Oh,

No,

They

his
parents?
S:
Like
my
father.
My
fa ther
was
tremendous
extrove r t.
N:
So
how
co me
you
were
not
like
your
parents?
S:
Because
I
was
like
my
mother.
I
was
like
my
gran dfather,
the
one
who
ha d
depression,
a
littl e
bit
of
depression.
Bu
t
he
was
in
trovert
also.
And
Rosa

my
grand,
the
mother
of
my
moth er,
she
was
extr overt.
N:
Mhm .
S:
She
was
a
s a leswoman.
N:
Mhm .
S:
You
have
these
things.
These
things
stay
with
you.
N:
So,
so–
S:
I
probably,
through
my
marriage,
I™m
probably
less
an
introvert
now
be
cause
my
wife.
N:
I
wanted
to
say
something
li ke
this.
I
don™t
think
you
sound
very
introverte d
at
all
at
th is
point.
S:
It
de pends
what
the
matter
is.
This
m a tter
interests
me
very
mu ch.
So,
in
this
matter,
I,
I
am
N:
You
are
e x troverted.
S:
I
clean
out,
all
my
whole
knowled

N:
So,
um,
di d,
did,
we
talk
about
why
you
had
chos en
Brazil
to
go
to?
S:
Yes,
because
my
father
didn™t
want
to
go
to
Argentina.
So,
we
went
to–
N:
But
th ere

other
cou ntries.
Why
B r azil?

S:
Very
small.
They™re
very
small.
Brazil
is
very
big.
It™s
an
enormous
country .
N:
Was
there
any
other
reason
why
you
chose
Brazil?
Was
there
any
conta ct?
S:
Well,
beca use
my
father
met
the
S tei nberg™s,
Jewi sh
people .
He
didn™ t
li ke
Ar genti na.
He
never
though t
of
going
to
Chile
or
Venezuela
or
to
Colombia
,
so
he
choose
a
bi g
countr y .
N:
Okay.
S:
It™s
a
practi cal
way
of
loo king
at
things.
N:
How
hard
was
it
to
learn
Portugu ese ?
S:
Hooo–.
N:
I
mean,
by
the n
you™re
an
adul t
so
it™ s
not
as
easy.
S:
I
know.
To
learn
it
well,
probably
a
year.
But
after
three
months
I
was
speaking
Portugu
ese
.
Probably
was
making
mistakes,
but
when
I
wa nted
a
loaf
of
bread,
they
ga ve
me
a
loaf
of
bread.
When
I
wanted
a
pineappl e,
they
gave
me
a
pineappl e.
So,
N:
Mhm .
MH m.
S:
So,
the
more,
more,
co mplica ted
thi
ngs,
it
takes
ab
out
a
year
or
two,
bu t
yo u
learn
it.
