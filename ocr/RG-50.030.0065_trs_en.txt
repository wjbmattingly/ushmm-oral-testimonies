H ERBERT PUNDIK 
November 11, 1995 
 
Answer: Anyhow, uh, fr om that period I only reme mb
er one anticipated incident and it's quite 
remarkable.  I have got back me mories of I was 
locked, this was in the thirties when Hitler had 
taken over Germany and well he had to kind of, 
well you know, he stimulated a Nazi move me nt 
in Denmark. Of course, Nazi move me nts ____
________, against the Jews.  But what I meant by 
this, some instant in the school yard, and I must
 have been very unhappy because our headma ster 
who had finished ___________, he was a priest by ______________, by background, but 
running this prep school.  _______________ 
[headma ster's name ] called me  up to his office and 
tried to console me  and you know it's funny, it'
s uh, it's uh, it's uh, almost sixty years ago.  
_____________, [headmaster's  name ] took off this typi
ng and put it on my label and said that 
this is for you.  It's fantastic, that this small 
incident I rememb er so vivi dly because it was a 
gentle way of declaring sympathy.  
But, at any rate, at that time 
I must have been about ten years 
old or so, my grandmother had died, so it must ha
ve been in the mi d, in the mi d thirties, ma ybe 
thirty-six.  My father was th
e _____________, religious Jews who had the means.  They went, he 
went to Czechoslovakia and he found a 
scribe who could write a _____________, you know.  
This usually took about one year's
 time  and around thirty-seven my
 father went down to pick it 
up in Czechoslovakia and of course then it shou
ld be installed in the synagogue and this of 
course required a whole ceremony and 
I still reme mber at that time  they had move d to more, my 

grandparents had moved to more comfortabl
e quarters in the center of ___________, not far 
away from the synagogue by the way.  And um, I 
still reme mb er the procession leaving the flat 
of my grandparents, my grandfather, had take
n the route towards the 
synagogue it must have 
been about one kilome ter and in front of this 
procession were two poli
cemen riding on horseback 
___________, to keep order and then came the w
hole, you know, Orthodox Jewish community 
with the hasaan(ph), you know, the 
church singer in front singing 
all kind of very sad Jewish, 
Hebrew songs, I'm sure prayers.  And after this
 came , my grandfather holding the Torah(ph), he 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0065

was not a very tall fellow, must ha
ve been about sixty or so.  The 
Torah was almost as tall as he 
was.  It was a beautiful decorated ____________, 
of the fa mily had ma de with the cover 
decoration with, you know, the name
 of my grandmother and so on and so forth and the whole 
Jewish community followed my grandfather then hi
s sons and the rest of the community and the 
Rabi and what not, you know.  And when we pa
ssed, the windows of the other private school in 
this district we had always 
been in competition, sports competition and academic, you know, 
competition who brought out the best, the best , you know the best exams and so on.  I reme mber 
the pupil, this strange, no exo
tic sons, all three they rushed 
out and looked out from the  window, 
hey __________, you know, it was me , they knew me  from
 the football field, ah this is Pundik, 
you know.  They didn't say first name s at that time  usually for mal.  Pundik _______,      

yes, DKs laid up[ph], one of the school ma tes 
reme mbered this incident and it ma de a deep 
impression on him of course because it was so 
we ird, it was so odd, but it ma de a very strong 

impression on me , which I reme mbe r  to this day.
  It gave me  some  kind of, you know, spiritual 
base, not in a religious term, I respect very much 
my grandfather and my uncle's and my father to 
stand by their traditions and 
not to succumb, you know, to fear and what not and simply go 
through with this procession as it should be done.  
And I mu st say that very often I have been in 

all kinds of strange situations, I've been remi
nded of this because these people, they, you know, 
you couldn't, they were not, they were not, doubtful
 about, they ma y have  lo
st, slowly lost their 
religious feeling, but as Jews to remit very pr
oud, very full of self assurance; which ma de it 
easier for them to become _________, because 
if you stand by your culture the __________, will 
respect you for what you are.  Bu
t if you start, you know, being 
wishy-washy and you lose your 
culture background it become s mo
re difficult for you to be accepted and integrated in 
__________, culture.  Jewish culture and other nationa
l cultures go very well together because 
the Jewish culture of Tereshney[ph] was spiritual 
culture, not nationally, not 
nationally, rooted in 
a special territory.  That what is said about
 Jewish living, you know, the new Jews almost 
thought(ph), that this was some thing in the he
aven, I mean, it was not through(ph) the Turkish 
Jews living in Palestine.  So this
 is, I want to relate one more in
cident which is, which is, told to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0065  
3 
 
me  a couple of years ago, I had a schoolma te who 
is also of Jewish origin in this elementary 
school, this schoolma te, uh, came from an assimilated family, _________, I mean they came  
probably two or three generations before us.  
They came from a place in Germany called Desow 
(ph) and the name  of the fa mily to this day re
ma ins Desow (ph) and he told me  when we me t by 
chance a couple of years ago, that, uh, I was al
wa ys dressed in brown, for some  reason my 
mother always thought that brown suited me  
well, uh, and of course a very unharmonious 
relationship between me  and 
the color brown ________________, I can't  stand it, but that is how 
it was imposed on you, so I even dressed up in 
brown, what do you call it, special weaving, uh... 
Q: Herringbone 

A: I don't know, it's some kind of brown, uh, we ll most 
of us either wore bl
ue or gray, or what 
not, but I wore brown.  This guy from Desow(
ph) he once came home and asked his mother, 

Tammy(ph), what is being Jew and then the moth
er said, well Jew, she didn't  say Jewish like 
you, no, no, she said well the Jew, this is _______
_ like Putnik.  So, now I understand he said, 
the Jews are those who walk around with thie
r brown outfits.  Anyhow, fr om that school I 
graduated into the Jewish school of the fine ar
ts, by the way, also been
 a pupil, uh, and later I 
went to, we ought to now reach 1940, uh, 1940.  
I finished the other school which was a 
rema rkable free school and then I joined the Seng
re(ph), the Sengre School
, one of the best in 
Coopenhagen, by the way, where the ma ster, the chie
f, rector, whatever 
they are called was 
ma rried to a Jewish woman who had been my fa
ther's  teacher in the Jewish school.  You know 
it's a very, very small community, both the Jewi
sh and the non-Jewish community are very 
interwoven.  At any rate, so I, this was 1943 I joined this school, 

Q: This is when you(ph) joined the occupation. 

A: This was after the Germans in 1940 had occupied Denmark. 

Q: How did that effect your fa mily? 

A: We ll, you know, interesting that they Germans ma
de a deal with the Danish Governme nt.  So, 
when the German occupation was rather non-violent a few Danish soliders put up resistance 

because they didn't want to listen to the orders 
from the superiors to lay down their arms.  But in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0065

Janisport(ph) when the Germans just ma rched 
into neutral Denmark and Denmark had to know 
that of course they could provide heroes, get hero
es had they fought.  But they had no political or 
military power to assi st the Danish, the German occupation forces.  Demark succumbed, ma de a 
deal with the Germans, a deal by the way whic
h is of great significance to our life as Jews 
because that set us apart from 
the rest of the Jewish community in Europe, occupied Europe, 
because the ___________ ma de a deal with the Germans 
ba sed on a kind of mutual respect, so to 
say, sharing of, sharing of authority.  The Danes(ph) got permi
ssion from the Germans to go on 
with thei r normal lives.  Political parties were
 non-functioning, the par
liame nt went on giving 
laws, the governme nt was inside,  the King was 
riding through the town followed by a crowd of 
school children on his horseback and so
 to say for most days in these years, the first years of the 
occupation, life was relatively norma l, of course 
we were effected by the war and by the supply 
situation, but basically 
the Germans let the Danes(ph), you know, keep to themselves and run 
their own lives.  We  had two, we had two 
free parliame ntary elections Denmark ____________ 
during the German occupation and the last one, 
the Nazi party, was simpl y trashed and the 
Germans di dn't, didn't interfere.  The Germans on 
their side of course wa
nted the Danes(ph) to 
let the Germans go on, so to say, building fortress
es along the west coast 
to protect against a 
possible allied invasion and Denmark was suppos
ed to be kind of supplying people for the 
Germans so the last part of the agricultural produ
ction(ph) went to the German ar my a nd the last 
part of the industrial pr oduction went  to, so
 Denmark as a matter of fact became kind of 
unwilling, but still partner to the German war effort
, one has to admit that, but this, sorry yes... 
Q: Let me  a s k you about the Jewish community a
nd your family in particular.  Did they feel 
threatened, vulnerable, did they feel... 

A: no, no, no... 

Q: They felt protected by the Danes? 

A: We ll the Danish governme nt, this of course
 we did not know, but we know today.  The 
Danish governme nt told the Germans that there 
we re a number of red lines which the Germans 

were supposed to respect in order 
to protect Danish sovreignty.  
One of the red lines wa s that no 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0065  
5 
 
distinction between Danish citizens.  Meani
ng that no special anti-J
ewish legislation, no 
interference with Jewish
 life at the synagogue, the synagogues 
were operating the schools, were 
operating the old age home s, whatever you had 
so the structure of the Jewish community 
remained untouched by the German occupation until 
a certain mo me nt of course, which was the 
fa mous day of 29th of August 1943.  I want to ju
st relate one thing, of
 course the Jews knew 
about what was on in Europe, but vaguel
y, you know we didn't even know in 1942, in 
September, October the Germans ha d arrested th
e ma jority of the Norwegian Jews, although we 
were related to the community, intermarriage 
between the communities a
nd youthful activities, 
we didn't know because we kind of lived in empt
y space, we didn't have infor mation.  We  could 
hear pbc of course, but pbc didn't know much 
a bout the holocaust either until 1943, we didn't 
know about the Wa rsaw Ghetto for instance, and th
e allies did not consider 
this a very important 
item in the news broadcasting, so we lived as 
a matter of fact in a 
fools paradise.  Being 
persuaded to believe that the norma l life we liv
ed could continue without end.  In the Da nish 
community, by the way, was influenced by the Dani
sh patricians, the Danish officials went on 
telling us, don't be afraid, we'll protect you because we have told the Germans if they touch the 
Jews this is what you call _________________, this woul
d be cause for war and then we would 
resign and the Germans would have to run the 
country.  The Germans at that time  did not 
necessarily have the desire to 
turn this country which was se
rving their ends into a hostile 
country which they would have to occupy with tens
 of thousands of soldiers which they needed 
some where else.  So there was kind of a balan
ce based on communal intere
st, the Danish wanted 
to run the country safely out of the war the Germ
ans wanted to have as much peace as possible to 
concentrate their efforts in another front. 

Q: We re there Jews who went 
into the resistance, the... 
A: I wanted to come  to this because  one of 
the things that was posted on us was not to get 

involved with the emerging resistance, don't ge
t the __________ resistance star
ted, acting to be a 
popular moveme nt only after the mi d or end 1943.  Until then resist ance was some  groups 

committing small sabotage acts, publishing newspa
pers, but it was not some thing which the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0065  
6 
 
Germans at all felt threatened by, not at all.  
Maybe it consisted of a few hundred Danish people, 
but ____________didn't want to enjoy the benefits of this Danish-Germa n agreement.  People 
bother, but they have no effect on the German wa
r effort.  So, we were told don't join them.  
Now I was at that time at the age of 15 and of cour
se I joined them.  I f people told me  not to do it 
________ and it happened so that the fa mous communist ___________, it was a schoolma te of 

mi ne.  We  st arted selling illegal newspapers 
and books published by the emerging resistance in 
order to finance their activities, they sold th
ese books to underground of course, it was banned by 
the Germans, banned by the authorities, by the censor, the Danes had a post on Denma r k.  The 

Danes in order to prevent annoying the Germans 
too much, so one of the books I reme mber was 
by John Steinbeck.  He was a part of the Germa n o
ccupation of Norway with me .  He write, not a 
very sophisticated book, what 
it was, it served the purpose of
 these times.  So, we were 
___________ and of course the first thing you did was to
 settle to your family, but at any rate 
this was discolored by my father who was a me mb
er of the Jewish, one of the Jewish community 
agencies, member of the  board or some thing.  So 
of course he was more exposed(ph) than others 

because the Germans, as  you know, that there had 
been always before going for the Jews in the 
community to take all the me mbers of the leader sh
ip of the community simply to deprive the rest  
of the Jews from any leadership.  This is the way 
they used to handle it.  So my father was very 
unnerved, you've got to do this because that mi ght put me , the fa mily, the community in a very 

sensitive dangerous position.  And I didn't want to 
listen to my father and he of course, what do 
you do, you call the chief Rabbi.  At that time 
chief Rabbis were not admi nistrators of 
community affairs.  They were people, impos
ing people with beards, you know and supposed to 
harbor a certain amount of wisdom.  So
 I was told to go to the chief Rabbi. 
Q: This is Fleetiger(ph)? 

A: His name  was Max Fleetiger(ph). He was origin
ally from Hungary.  He spoke in the Danish 
language, but of course speaking with a heavy 
Hungarian accent.  Later he was taken by the 
Germans and brought to a concentration camp and survived and came back  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0065  
7 
 
into the community again.  But,
 I still reme mber, there are so
me  parts in history which you 
reme mber vividly where you are st
anding or sitting with the othe
r guy, like the story with the 
typing, I reme mber that I was asked to sit down.
  I was standing up and he was sitting behind a 
huge desk with his ________, his ________ a
nd had a beard like ________ or ________ square, 
long beard, very well groome d, but you know.  They to
ld me that they, he 
ordered me  to give up 
all this playing around and he said, I reme mber 
this today, if you don't give it up, you and others 
of your sort, you know, will risk the welfare of 
the Jewish community because if the Germans 
catch you or the Danes catch you revenge mi ght betaken and that mi ght put the whole safety of 

our community in danger.  So, give it up.  The mo me
nt that you have been told that you have the 

responsibility for a whole community and you're 
only fifteen years old, of course you'll give it 
up.  So I went home and I burnt, and burnt all that
 was left of the illegal books and newspapers 
and so on.  That must have been imme diat
ely before the trip to ____________ or immediately 
after.  But you know that in 1943, August there 
was a clash between the Danes and the German 
interest and to put it shortly 
the Danes resigned and the Danish Governme nt retired and the 
Parliame nt went home t he King went into exil
e in his castle and the Shee(ph) which has 
protected us from Ger ma n encroachme nt was 
removed overnight.  Suddenly there we re only 

Germans and us.  The Germans didn't have to anym
ore consider this deal about you stick to your 
things and we 'll stick to our things and the Jewi
sh we are leaving behind.  So at that time , 1943 
August, about half of the Jewish
 community of Europe had been 
destroyed by the holocaust.  We  
didn't know a thing, we didn't prepare a thing, th
e community did not try to build up kind of 
___________ work preparing us.  We were ______, we
 were ____, I reme mber my father went 
to the Director of the Foreign Ministry, during these days, of course we had a feeling that the 

situation had changed dramatically and that of 
course would change our 
situation, but we just 
didn't know how and he went to the Director 
of Foreign Ministry, who wa s living in the 
neighboring house and he asked me  what's  new s o 
he said, don't worry, I have contact with the 

Germans all of the time and if anything is cr
opping up, we will warn you, don't worry.  We ll, of 
course some thing cropped up, ma inly the German 
Nazi against the Jews on the 2nd of October 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0065  
8 
 
and he never warned us.  I just want to tell in
 brackets a little huma n 
angle.  We escaped of 
course and came  back a couple of
 years(ph) later from
 Swede n and right after our return my 
parents sent this, ___________ by then
 had retired, a big bunch of
 flowers saying, don't worry, 
you didn't warn us but we  got away and safely we came back.  Now, whet her they heard 
anything from me  or not, I don't know, it was a ve
ry, very difficult situation of course, being 
faced with this old preach of pr
omise.  But many, many years late
r when I was serving as chief 
editor of the Danish daily newspaper called, Put  
    ,(ph) ma ybe 50 years later–and one of our 
staff me mbers aboard the 22 union(ph) it was not very
 easy because he sort of wanted to stay out 
of the limelight.  I called him and asked him to
 make an exception and ________ our reporter.  
He said, well I'll tell you one thing, there's one bunc
h of flowers I received 
one night which I will 
never forget.  These were the flowers which your
 parents sent me  in 1945 after you came  back 
from refuge in Sweden.  It meant a lot to him 
that some  people were trying to forgive him for 
having broken his promise.  Which of course could 
have cost us our lives, of
 course.  At any rate, 
so the Danish underground move me nt started be
comi ng mor e  and more of a nuisance to the 
Germans.  At one point the Germans wanted the 
Danish Governme nt, the Danish authorities had 
control over the Danish army, the Da nish police, 
everything was in place.  The Germans wanted 
the Danes to take steps in order to crush the underground mo veme nt and to ________ the Jews 

they sentenced for sabotage of court(ph) and so 
on and so forth.  We ll it's a long story, but the 
Danes refused the whole set up, so to say once ab
olished(ph) and the Germans were sitting with 
the ma rk in their hands and ___________.  Then come  September, September month and 

some body else was figuring on what happened polit
ically, especially on 
the German scene(ph) 
with regard to our situation as Jews in Denmark.  But suffice here to say that the Germans 

decided to extend the Jewish repression to 
Danish Jews, about 6,000 ma ybe 7,000 we were at 
that time and they ordered three ships to co
me  fr om Ger many and anchor in Copenhagen 
preparing to take us and a 
group of communists who had been imprisoned by the Danish 
authorities who had not yet been 
released, not succeeded in being 
released when the authorities 
went home.  So the Germans si mply arrest
ed them as one of the most, most ______________ 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0065  
9 
 
dishonorable, dishonorable events 
in modern day history, by the 
way.  Of course they were 
arrest ed and kept against the constitution.  Anyhow
, the ships were prepared to take  7,000 Jews 
and a few hundred communists to Ge rmany or to Po
land, whatever they planned to do.  But then 
some thing happened which enabled us to be warn
ed beforehand and just shortly a warning came 
from the German who was the head of 
the German _________ occupation authorities in 
Denmark.  His name  was We rn Bes t (ph), We rn with a "W", Best, B-E-S-T and he instigated the 
entire Jewish activities by advising Hitler th
at now was the time after the Danish-German 
cooperation had collapsed, now was 
the time to go for the Jews.  But for his own reasons, which 
is a very complicated ma tter, I don't want to 
go into too ma ny details because people are much 
more versed into the details than
 I am.  For his own reasons, he le
t the secret slip out and told 
one of his collaborators in the German, 
in the German e mbas s y _____________.  A fellow who 
was a Nazi too, his name  was Tuckawitz, T-U-C-K-A-W-I-T-Z, Tuckawitz, told about the 

approaching, German, German, action, I guess th
e Jews...Now this Tuckawitz, by the way, was a 
me mber of the German Nazi party, an early me mb
er of the Nazi party.  Best was mu ch earlier, 
Best was one of the evil spirits of the police depa
rtme nt of the emerging Nazi party even before 
the two powers divides(ph) into 
three.  Really, really a war 
criminal.  He was not ever 
condemned to death, he should have been, for the r
eason that he let the secr
et slip and this was 
used by his defense to protect him 
against a life sentence after, deat
h sent ence after the war.  But 
Tuckawitz was kind of a reformed Nazi a
nd he became close, he was a neighbor, __________ 
commercial, __________ commercial.  He had been 
with Cama ris the head of the German 
__________ intelligence.  Ca ma ris, C-A-M-A-R
-I-S who is by the way _________ execute(ph) 

by the Nazis.  He had been with him at this j
ob at the German embassy and was to prepare the 
German occ upation of Denmark in 1940.  But he rema ined here and established very close 

contact with the leaderships of th
e socialcratic party and became  
e mbarked with them and started 
to distancing hims elf fr om the Nazi ideology.  Of 
course especially the an
ti-Jewish part of it and 
that when Be st tipped him off saying that th
is day the __________ of the Jews will take place 
and Best is quoted by Tuckawitz by the way, after 
the war.  In racial talk or what German 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0065  
10 
 
___________ to the station.  Tuckawitz quoted Best as 
saying, "I wish we 
could build a bridge 
across the south between Denmark and Sweden to ai
d these poor people to get safely away."  We  
never, we never know if Tuckawitz invented this, there's no motiv
e for his having to invent it, 
but there's no third witness.  You only have his wo
rd for it that Best didn't say it(ph), not because 
he loved(ph) Jews, he had been spending half his 
year fighting Jews, killing Jews.  But his didn't 
find that it was in his best inte
rests that particular mo ment of
 history where everything was going 
against the German, the German arms, after the 
invasion of Italy.  Afte
r the collapse of the 
German, the German mi l itary that fought in 
the Stantengard(ph) in Eastern Russia, in 
____________ Russia.  It was not for his, in his  

interests that this anti-Jewis
h action should secede, that's w
hy he told it to Tuckawitz who 
immediately informed th e German, the Danish 
social-democratic(ph) leaders, who immediately 
went to the head of the Jewish community, a very
 respectable and respective lawyer of the high 
court called C.B. Pedricus(ph), a famous 
Jewish ____________ name .  And they went to him 
and told hi m, okay, now you better prepare for some thing because there are only a couple of 

days left.  And it's very interesting, it has to 
be reme mbered because part of the Disney Land 
atmosphere which we lived, they were killing Jews
 all over, all around us.  From Norway and all 
through the continent and 
we thought that we would go Scot-free 
and didn't  prepare for anything.  
The Jewish community and leadership didn't even
 destroy the index of name s and addresses of 
the Jewish community.  The Germans came one day 
and confiscated it.  Still this was not enough 
for us, so start moving, you know.  A
nd this guy in ________ and ____________ the Danish 
political(ph) leaders, _______ to want him( ph), 
they said, Mr. Hedtoft,
 H-E-D-T-O-F-T, Mr. 
Hedtoft, later became the prime mi nister of Denm
ark after the war.  He said, you are lying, he 
said well Hedtoft told him that he had a good s
ource and that the game  wa s up.  You are lying.  
And Hedtoft almost broke out in tears because 
he was facing the war(ph) and the war(ph) didn't 

respond.  But they succeeded afte
r a while at making them unders
tand that this was a serious 
ma tter and then out went the warning, the telephone chain as they called it, from one Jewish 

fa mily to another that tomorrow, the day af
ter tomorrow, don't stay at home because the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0065  
11 
 
Germans wi ll come after us.  Where you go, ev
erybody was on his own.  The community had not 
prepare any escape route or any 
escape organization, nope, nothing. 
Q: How did your father hear?   Do you reme mbe r? 
A: My father, yes, my fa ther heard this fr
om somebody who had called him, who had been to 
morning prayers in the synagogue on September 
13th I think.  And he came home, I was in 
school, you know, we went on acting 
as if life was norma l, you know, and as if we were as 

Danish as the Danes; which to some  extent we we re
, at least in the eyes of the Danes, but not in 
the eyes of the Germans of course.  By the 
way there was no yellow star, you know, there were 
no, there were no special legislation introduced by 
the Germans as regards to the Jewish part of 
the Danish community, Danish population.  I went 
to school early in the morning, ma ybe at ten 
o'clock or so, the headma ster came  in and he 
said, "I'm sorry but you and you," he said, "you 

better come  out, I have some thing to tell you in th
e corridor."  And I reme mber that suddenly we 
got up from our desks and were following him.  S
uddenly he turned around again and he said to 
the teacher, "you better come w
ith me too."  The teacher was 
also a part Jewish __________ and 
then the ___________ fade away(ph).  But you know, at
 that time, I was fifteen, I was fifteen 
years old I must have been, you know, retarded
 because I didn't understand anything at all, 
because we didn't speak about these things at home. 

Q: So you weren't afraid? 

A: I was not afraid.  You know I remember I t
ook the tram(ph) and I went to Keyosk(ph) to buy 
the weekly ma gazines as I have done every week 
and I still re me mber I 
came with the weekly 
ma gazine sitting under my arms.  My parent
s, the door was wide __________, my parents were 
waiting all dressed up, you know, over coat, why it wa
s winter(ph), October, and said, "hurry up, 
we have to get away."  And that's  what we got because we...

Q: Herbert, I would like to begin by asking 
you about your family background and when your 
parents or grandparents came  to Denmark. 
A:  Well, as a matter of fact I am the first ge
neration born in Denmark.  M y father's side the 
fa mily came just after the turn of the century 
from Ukraine, a town called Romney.  Which is 
quite a famo us town in Jewish history because
 a guy named Toebetor, who became a hero in the 

Palestine fighting(ph) with the Arab's (ph) back 
in the 20's came from there.  Another guy called 
Rotenbeck(ph) who ma de the first project for el
ectrification(ph) of Pa
lestine _________ there.  
My, _______, the first group of __________chim( ph) agricultural pioneers came  from the same  

small town called Romney and they settled at
 the canya(ph)  and they formed the first 

_____________.  Now my grandfather was what they
 call a kabaducma ha(ph).  That means 
a...do you know what that is?  We ll, he ma de hats, caps.  And he told me  when I was a young 

ma n and I asked him why did you leave Romney
, why did you run away from Russia, the 

Ukraine.  He said that there was a _________ 
in Romney around 1903 or 4, there was a whole 
empeta my(ph) of good programs at that time 
___________ the collection(ph) 
with the defeat of 
Russians to the Russian-Japanese war.  And this 
Romney was a little infl uential town where half 
of the population was Jewish, ma ny 
of them were artisans, as 
my grandfather and he and a 
number of fr iends lived in a square, fa rm-like bui
lding on the outskirts of 
the town.  And he told 
me  that just before the pulcrum( ph) erupted a 
Russian officer came to him and he was from the 
Cossack brigade and told him that you come  with 
him and take his family.  And you know at that 
time you didn't ask why when an offi cer told you, so he took the fa mily and they walked to the 

house of the officer and he said you stay here.  
And just right after the pulcrum( ph) erupted ma ny 

Jews were killed some  of the work staff(ph) in
 this farm-like building where my grandfather had 
his works were burned and after the pulcrum the 
officer took my grandfat
her back to the place 
and on the way he asked him, "why did you save me
 and my fa mily?"  and the officer said, "well 
Jew, that's because you ma ke such wonderful hats
 for my s oldiers."  And my grandfather who 
hadn't finished any ma in(ph) university or any highe
r education he just knew that to survive that 
if the future of his fa mily was dependent on his ha
ts fit square with the soldiers heads then he

better get out as quick as possible.  So the p
ack(ph) ________ that was left
 and of course they 
were on their way to America, like most Jews, millions of Jews during these years went to 
America.  Being poor people the money quickly was spent when the __________ in Germany 

they had no more money to pay for their passag
e across the Atlantic.  
So they ma de up their 
mi nd to go to some place called Denmark.  Why Denmark, because my grandmother had a 

brother who had immi grated earlie
r to Denmark and he had sent 
some  postcards saying that it 
was not a bad country.  So the thoughts in their heads were let's go where the money reached, the 

money took them to Goma in(ph), that was, as 
I said around 1905 or 6 or
 some thing.  And they 
settled down in one of the poores
t quarters of Copenhagen, which today of course is Bohem( ph) 
quarter and were renovated(ph) slum
 houses.  It was, but they we
nt there because it was Jewish 
district and they could meet people which s
poke their language, which 
was not Russian it was 
Yettish, they were not Russian spea ke rs.  And th
ey could somehow repeat and rebuild to some  
extent the medium(ph) in which they had lived. 

Q: A religious _________? 

A: We ll, that's what I want to add.  Another r
eason why they went their was that it was not far 
away, within walking distance from the synagogue
.  For them the synagogue was the center in 
their lives, both the religious life a
nd the sacred(ph) 
life they lived. 
Q: Which synagogue? 

A: Well it was, it was the synagogue which belo
nged to the Uta(ph) or
thodox and the community 
which was built around that time .  ______________, it 
was not at that time as far as my  
grandfather goes, the big syna
gogue which had the kind of mode
rnistic service, although it's 
conservative.  He looked for his people a
nd they were at this small ______________ synagogue.  
Of course, the ______________, my father's  generation 
they left the synagogue and joined the 
large, more modern synagogue.  But this was kind of an intima te _______ relationship with 

religion.  By the way this relationship with religio
n didn't last for long because my grandfather of 
course was very religious, he wa
s also a small bearded fellow, my
 father didn't of course, he 
shaved and he was observant but not ________ or
thodox and the third generation intermarried 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0065  
14 
 
and in a few cases were not Jews or became non
-observant .  But still of course were so me  
hang(ph) for tradition, you know, they speak about  two kinds of Jews:  they speak about 
Balkhudan(ph); means Jews whose __________ 
sits in the stomach, gives ______________ 
Jews and the other group is called; alkhudan, which 
means that they are also Jews.  But at any 
rate, so they settled there, and of
 course at that time  they were 
three children, one of them that 
immi grated was my father.  He 
was at that time  he was ma ybe 5, 6, 7 years old.  They were 

immediately sent to school.  And here starts
 the immediate integration into Danish society 
because of this school wa s a Jewish school was fo
rmed by a Jew of Danish origin who saw that 

these immi grants who came from 
Pol a nd, from Russia at the turn 
of the century.  They had to 
become  Danes quickly, he didn't mi nd if they woul
d stay Jewish as far as religious observances, 

but he wanted them integrate us as quickly as pos
si ble into the Danish so
cial life.  Simply in 
order to protect the community that was 
there from rotten shoulders ________ cold(ph) 
religionist who sort of say would be looked 
at with hostility from the Danish environment 
because they were unobservant.  So this was a gr
eat lack of the Danish-Jewish community that 
they would provide services th
at would imme diately channel th
em into the Danish society.  
Learning language, getting r
eady for Danish career.   
Q: Did your grandfather c
ontinue as a hat ma ker? 
A: He continued, sure he continued as a hat ma ke
r and my fa ther when he was at the age of 9, 10 
years old when he came back from s c hool, everyday he would have to take a case with hats, 6 

penses, you know, and go in the harb
or of Copenhagen.  At that ti
me  Copenhagen was very, very 
dynami c harbor town, which it is not today, and to 
sell six penses to the sa
ilors and to the harbor, 
port workers and so on.  From that time  my fathe r
 had a deep feeling of 
gratitude to the Danish 
working class.  Which ___________ put a little atti
tude so that he, although it became  what you 
would call industrially started 
capitalism, he went on continued voting for social democrats 
because as he  always told me , these people, 
you can ma tch a little Yettish speaking boy looking 
strange with this Danish _________ were __________ Dani
sh of course, but two or three years 
in the country, walking around the harbor with a 
box of 6 penses trying to peddle them to the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0065  
15 
 
Danish workers.  He could feel 
rejected by them and the country, so
 he had a very, since then, he 
so to say P___________[person's name ] admi red the Je
ws to politics and he became very, very 
generous as a donor for all kinds of Jewish and 
non-Jewish causes because he felt that he owed 
these people some thing.  By the way, jumping out abit, but when they late
r built a very large and 
modern textile factory in Copenhage
n he was one of the first Danish 
industrialists to attend to the 
needs of the workers.  Providing for instan
ce, kindergarten for the __________ workers who 
couldn't leave home or fi nd a place in the public se
rvice and a building one 
of the best, beautiful 
canteens facing a garden so that
 they could relax.  He was,
 he didn't know that he was 
progressive, but he acted in a ve
ry progressive way out of purel
y sentimental reasons.  At any 
rate, so they settled here, and 
of course I'm not telling you anything that you don't know, because 
it's sort of kind of a replica of what happened to ma ny Jews who ca me  to the east coast of 
A merica as immigrants from the sa me areas.  
That they put learning very high because they 
knew, for two reasons.  Learning was part of th
e Jewish tradition, of course.  The religious 
tradition, where all, all 
________ children quickly at
 the age of 3 or 4 years went to Torah(ph) 
school and learned to read.  Read 
Hebrew letters, so of course this was pretty converted also so 
the desire to learn other things
, other written languages but He
brew.  That was one thing, the 
respect for the book and the respectfor the language.  And secondly of
 course we learned that if 
you want to kind of upward mobility in society, you 
had to study.  So my father couldn't  afford it 
because he was the eldest so he had to go out an
d help the parents make a living, so the others 
could afford to study.  But the second boy in 
the fa mily became  an engineer and living  
great _________ desires.  And he became one ofthe very first immi grant boys who graduated 

from the university.  So very quickly they starte
d moving into society.  Then of course came  the 
first World War, 1914.  Denmark was, as you know, a neutral country and there was kind of an 

economic boom, prosperity in Denmark because 
it was neut ral.  Of course it expl oited the 
possibilities it had by suppl
ying the warring(ph) states
 with what they needed.  There was Danish 
military mo bilization to protect the neutrality of
 Denmark and of course these soldiers they 
needed hats and they needed uniforms and so 
on.  And the Jewish didn't know anything about a 7 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0065  
16 
 
or 8 day work week, you know, a 7 or 8 hour work week.  They worked as much, as long as they 
needed to provide, to supply those that gave th
em to consignments.  They started establishing 

themselves and moving from this very poor street
 to this street in the same  neighborhood which 

was a little bit less poorer, and I 
have a list at home  which one 
of my uncles made where he 
noted all of the addresses within the first coupleof years.  It wa s tremendous, this was kind of 

mi grant population.  _________ they ha
d more money, they got anothe
r child, they moved into a 
flat with a half room more, bedroom more, that
's  how they slowly, slowly progressed and moved 
into more boudoir quarters and became, as a ma t t er 
of fact part of the Danish mi ddle class.  
Within probably the early 30's they had become  mi ddle class. 

Q: Living separately in a Jewish comm
unity within the Danish mi ddle class? 
A: No, no, when the mome nt they moved out of th
e poor quarter, of course they moved into the 
mi ddle, they used the Danish community.  I wouldn't 
say that they had lots 
of social contact with 
them of cour se, because still their religion and the 
synagogue was, so to say, the axis of their life.  
But of course, there were 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, there were
 8 children and of cour
se the children reached 
out towards Danish society.  You probably ha
d the same  effect that you have today, ma ny 
Danish girls attempted to strike
 up relationships with types from the Mediterranean and these 
were not Mediterranean's , but they we re exotic at
 least.  And Denmark at that time was a very, 
very homogenous society and when these young Je
ws came to Copenhagen, they were attractive 
and exotic.  By the way ma ny of them ma rried n
on-Jewish, already(ph) in
 the first generation. 
Q: And how did your gra
ndfather react to that? 
A: You know, you know what happens, I don't know if this is pattern, but anyhow in my 

experience is that there are several phases.  On
e of the phases, one is a phase of shock.  The 
second is the phase of slowly ad
apting but not reestablishing cont
acts. The third phase is when 
the first child is born and then the whole 
bloody thing breaks down, you know you can't, then 
relations are reestablished and 
everybody's __________ is happy.  But at
 any rate, I just want to 
go back for one mo ment to this Romney, I trie
d to visit it during the communist times before 
Gorbachev and before the break down of the sovi
et system.  I went with a friend, a Russian 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0065  
17 
 
speaking friend, and we went to Kiev(ph) and we
 asked if anybody would take us to this place 
which is about 150 kilome ters from Romney a
nd everybody shied away and said, no you need a 
special permit, this is a closed country.  So
 we found a very unhappy driver, unhappy because he 
was deeply indebt for playing some  kind of, I don't know, has a rd(ph) or whatever it wa s. One of 

his other friends, and couldn't pay 
his debt to the people who he 
owed money, they were people, 
very strong arme d people.  One of his friends ha
d to explain to us, we should jump out of the 

window because ___________ was jumping himself or 
being thrown out of the window, so he 
wanted to make money.  You know, at any costs, so
 he decided that it was worth to run the risk 
and take us without permission to
 Romney and during the trip he 
turned to us and said, this 
friend of yours who speaks perfect Russian, they'r
e Danish Jew, by the way, but born in Russia, 
he was a corespondent of the Danish state journalis
t in Moscow.  He said that this guy is from 
the KGB, so we said why should he be from th
e KGB?   We ll, he speaks such perfect Russian, 

he's  just posing as a Danish journalist.  But 
after just a few miles, the guy turns around and he 
said to us, "gee" he said, "I'm sorry, I ma de a 
mi stake he's not from the KGB."  And we  said, 
"how do you know by now" and he said, "look out 
through the back window" and we looked out 
and there was a car following us, he
 said, "these are the KGB's ."  A
nd they really followed us all 
the way from Kiev(ph) about 150 kilome ters to 
the outskirts of the town Baneso(ph) the sign 
board spelling Romney, then they jumped at us
, they stopped our progress and we had to go out, 

we had to sign documents and ther
e was investigation and what not. 
 Later we complained to the 
Russian foreign mi nister, of course, didn't help. 
 I asked one of the Russians to take me , how 
long __________ _________ ________ to keep this place closed.  He said, "well as long as you 

want to visi t it, it remains closed."   There must have been some military reasons, reasons for it.  

Anyhow, now of course, the town, I wanted to see.
  Maybe because of family, ma ybe  because of 

cemetery, maybe because of the synagogue.  I just 
wanted, for several reasons, to see the place 
where my father had been born.  But now, of 
course, everybody can go there, but now I'm not 
very attracted by it anymore.  It was the prohib
ition that was attractive 
apparently.  But anyhow, 
from this town, originally the first group that fo
rmed the first collective settleme nt keboots(ph) in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0065  
18 
 
Palestine at that time , later Israel.  That was around 1908, or some thing of that close, ma ybe 
1909.  But I asked my gr andfather, why didn't you join them, you were the same  age group and 

you had to leave your town anyhow?  Why did 
you have to take this long route around 
Copenhagen and what not, just for me  50 odd years afte
rwards to have to rise and go to Zion(ph), 
you know, all the troubles.  
We  could have landed there earlier, be
 part of the aristocracy.  So he 
said, "are you crazy," I would ne
ver have guessed this, he said, "do you think that I would have 
joined a ga ng where the Tracy Malicker(ph),"  
it's a Yettish, it's a Yettish derivation of 

Melcher(ph) which is a fema le na me  in Hebrew
, "the Tracy Malicker, should I join these 
barefoot people, you know, they walk around bare
foot."  It's true, that the first _________ you 
know, that they called them the "b
all fees(ph)," the barefeet, be
cause they were poor and they 
ma de an issue about being puretanic(ph) and s
o.  We ll anyhow I decided 
that, well, they were 
crazy we all could see that they
 were crazy, we all could see th
at they were crazy, you know.  I 
decided that I wanted to fi nd out what this cr
azy Malicker(ph) had been doing and I called the 
keeboots(ph) and they found out that this crazy Ma
licker(ph) who my grandf
ather didn't  want to 
join, she became  one of t he most prominent edu
cators in the Palestine 
Zionist(ph) Keeboots(ph) 
move me nt.  But anyhow, to jump ahead, we, my 
grandfather, became retired and my father 
started working at the Petlier(ph), the fa
mous 7 ___________, you know.  They only went to 
school for 7 years at that time and he became astatesma n(ph)[possibly "salesma n" and he passed 

the career which, you know, the ma rriage of Jewishimmi grants, he started as an employee, as a 

statesman, he became independent(ph) statesman a
nd by the year, he was traveling very much in 
Scandinavia, some  place else that the I have b
een living commuting betw
een Denmark and Israel 
for thirty years is part of the 
inheritance from my father.  Ever
y Sunday I me t my dad, we wished 
him well, and he went to the railw
ay station and either went to Da
ys(ph) Provinces, or he went to 
Sweden, or Finland to ma ke a living.  He cam
e back Friday went to the Synagogue in the 
evening, had to, __________ back at home  and on S unday off they went again.  In the mean 

time, he got married.  My mother's family ca
me  originally from Poland, when she was a couple 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0065  
19 
 
of years old they settled in Litic(ph).  I'm sure 
I inherited some of the adve nturous spirit of that  
part of the family because my grandfather, my great-grandfather... 

Q: On your mother's side. 

A: In the late ages they immigrated fr
om Poland to America and __________ came b ack and 
settled in Li tic(ph).  He called his family from
 Poland to Litic(ph), Litic
(ph) is in Germany.  
They became American citizens because he was natu
ralized as an American. 
 I still ha ve at home 
a fantastic picture where you see the old ma
n all dressed up, you know, on the day that he 
became an American citizen.  That must have been
 a glor ious day in his life.  Anyhow, from that 
mome nt the fa mily was American.  They were 
American citizens, but residing in Germany.  
Now when t he war started, the first World Wa r, th
ey of course, as American citizens, had to 
leave Germany, go to a neutral country.  So they
 went to Denmark.  And t hey stayed throughout 
the war years in Denmar k.  And they had a coupl
e of beautiful daughters and they were very 
respected in the community. 
 And after the war they  
returned to Litic(ph), but they left  the kind of
 impression on the Danish co mmunity here.  So 
when my fat her came of age and was supposed to 
find a wife to settle down, some  people in the 
community, "well, ______ ______ a very nice family 
from Litic(ph) and they had two beautiful 
daughters, go and take a look."  So my father we
nt, went to Litic(ph), and that must have been 
1925 or 6 and they ma rried and my 
mother joined, of course, my fa
ther in Copenhagen.  And that 
is how, how a nuclear family so to say, came to
 Denmark.  One from Russia, one from Poland, 
by America and Litic(ph) and they
 settled down in Copenhagen.  I was born in 1927.  This is 
more or less the origin of the fa mily.  In 1933 th
ey left the rest of the fami ly, my grandparents 
and left Litic(ph) and __________ they immi grated 
to America where some  of their boys already 
had gotten, became very American patriotic, 
you know they served, the boys, in the second 
World Wa r, the army, the navy and so on.  Very Americanized. 

Q: What was your mother's fa mily's name?  

A: Original ly it was Takl etau
b(ph).  It's  not an unusual 
Jewish name , Takletaub(ph).  
Takletaub(ph) is the name  of a certain kind of 
a dove, pigeon.  But they
 abbreviated "tove" to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0065  
20 
 
"taub," t-a-u-b.  This was more, I just want to
 say one funny thing about my grandfather on my 
mother's  side.  He was very, very strict and stubb
orn.  He's reme mbered as a disciplinary in the 
fa mily.  One of these autocratic, patriotic types,
 who could never do wrong, and if he ever did do 
wrong, he could never admit it.  My
 mother told me  one particul
ar case, he was supposed to go 
some place in Europe from Litic (ph)  the family
 took him to the train and they waved at him 
good-bye and he sat down and they were very _
______, they were very unemotional.  So they 

never stood in the window of the train waving 
good-bye, they simply, when they put out the 
window and took out the newspaper they c
ould __________ on the platform, you know, looking 
at the family patriarch leaving.  But what happe
ned that day was, he 
went onto the wrong train 
and instead of going to Paris, he ended up in Pr
ague and he could never admit it because had he 
changed in the meanti me, you know, half way, then 
of course it would be ridiculous.  So from 
that mo me nt he pretended that as a matter of 
fact he was supposed to go to Prague while the 
people were waiting for him in Paris.  So, a
nyhow, so they settled _________ and they got, my 
parents, got three childre
n.  Besides me , my brother and my si
ster.  My brother was killed by an 
accident  in 1946.  My sister immi grated, 7 year
s we immi grated in 1954.  To Israel(ph)  where 
she ma rried and lives today, has three children.  Th
at is more or less as far as I reme mber the 
relative background... 

Q: Were you the oldest, mi ddle? 

A: I was the oldest, yes. 

Q: And did you go to Jewish day school? 

A: Well I, I did go to Jewish day, th
e first five, the first day school...  
Q: ...day school... 

A: ...this I don't re me mb er. 

Q: You had me ntioned that... 

A: But I had went to the first elementary class, is
 the first 5 elementary school years.  I went to a 
private school in the area where we lived.  On
e of the snobbish schools in Copenhagen.  But this 
was part of the, not because my parents were
 snobs, but they wanted me  to have a good 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0065  
21 
 
education and succeed.  They wanted you quickly to jo
in, to join the rush.  So they put you in the 
best school available. 
Q: And Jews were allowed in any of those schools? 

A: Of course, Denmark was, since the Jews got ci
tizenship, they were totally equa l there.  Of 

course there were Danes who didn't like Jews but
 there was not anti-Semitism in Denmark.  I 
always distinguish between societies where you 
have anti-Semites and societies where you have 
anti-Semitism.  In Denmark you have  anti-Semites, 
the indivi duals but you never had a trend or  a 

move me nt of this kind.  Even the Nazis when th
ey for med a political party were very weak on 

the anti-Semitic stuff because they knew that this 
would reject some  of th
eir potential followers.  
You know, J e wish-Denmark for the last 150 year
s had been, there's been a kind of, you know, 
what do you call, these tries(ph) children pa
y(ph) within circuses, you know up and down, up 
and down mountain rides, you know, you had... 

Q: You me an a roller coaster? 

A: A roller coaster, that's  right, sorry, a roller
 coaster.  You had immi
gration, then the people 
who were after acclimatized(ph), they assimila
ted within a couple of generations.  The Jews 
almost were extinguished as communi ty, then a 
new wave of i mmigrants came ; so ca me up and 
down, up and down.  Today we hadn't had an im
mi gration in 1969 of Polish-Jews, a couple 
thousand Pol-Jews, the Danish 
community, the Jewish community would be very, very weak 
because si milar to what happened in
 some  of the states 
of America.  You have
 a integr ation rate 
or assimilation rate or intermarri
age rate, call it what you want fo
r more than 50, 60 percent.  So 
if no more Jews will arrive in Denmark or the 
ne xt  generation than the two Jew races, the two 
other year, two other century ol
d history of Danish Jews woul
d more or less be concluded. 
Q: Herbert, when you were younger, were there, 
did you participate in any religious ceremonies? 
A: We  were of course, we were observant at home.   

Q: Was a kosher home... 

A: I beg your pardon... 

Q: You had a kosher home .

A: Of course, yes.  I walked to Synagogue every Sa
turday an hour walk with
 my father.  Later of 
course, the chief Rabbi realized that he had to 
choose either between letting the Jews take the 
tram or the subway to Synagogue, or they wouldn
't  go to synagogue.  So they released the Jews, 
from the Jews to walk, and he permitted them
 under the condition that they had bought tickets 
the day before, he permitted them to drive to 
Synagogue.  By this, so to say, he saved the 
community from extinction.  At any rate, I reme
mber I was not supposed to go to school on the 
holidays or on the ________.  I was in the beginning when I was not supposed to wear anything, 
my pockets, you know.  I reme mber that I wore, wh
at they call abachafaut(ph), which is kind of 

cloth which you wear under your, on your skin with
 four tetsiut(ph) applied, you know.  This 
was a religious garment and I wore this as a child.  You can imagine that when we had physical 

training lessons in school and they discovered that
 this guy wore some  very strange things under 
his underwear.  But it gave me  a feel ing of identi
ty and I survived whatever it mi ght have been 
on funny rema rks.  And this ties up with a story 
that I want to tell you which happened to me  
during the same  period when I went to this el
ementary, non-Jewish school.  We ll one thing I 
reme mber very, very st rongly that was one anti-Se mitic incident in sc hool. 
End of Tape 2. 
Tape 3 
 
A: Anyhow, I reme mber when we took a taxi out to
 hide with a friend of my father's , a business 
friend, of course, non-Jewish couple.  And I was 
later told by my mother
, years after that the 
driver of the taxi refused to take
 money for the trip.  At that time
 this was the first sign of some  
kind of, say, popular resistance comi ng to the aid 
of the Danes.  You know, people were warned 
by neighbors, by Jewish fa milies to just leave th
eir homes.  But there were moving de tails, you 
know, some  Jews who took hiding into the woods 
because they had no where to go.  There was a 
botanical garden in the center of Copenhagen just
 across from one of the large municipal hospital 
and the doctors and nurses during the day went out 
and searched for Jews hiding in the botanical 
garden.  People who didn't  have business friends 
who they could turn to.  I reme mber, one of my, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0065  
23 
 
a friend of mi ne later at the university who b
ecame  a me mber of parliament for the social 
democratic party, his father was head of the soci
al democratic party orga
nization in the center of 
Copenhagen and he simply recruited his son and 
a few other youngsters and he told them to go 
through each and every house, look at the name  cards
 and when they see some thing that could be 
Jewish, warn them and tell them to get away.  At 
that time, already, lots of
 individual initiatives 
were taken.  There was no coordinating rule fo
r organization.  But the mo me nt the people, non-
Jews realized that the Jews were in danger, than
 all ki nds of initiatives 
were taken by individuals, 
by groups of people, by priests, by hospitals and so
 on.  So, this particular case, whenever they 
met a Jewish fa mily, ther e were many Jewish families in this area here, especially poorer Jewish 

fa milies because it was at that time before the 
war rest rictive, not so, 
no quality housing, I would 
say to put it mildly.  So they had been told, if 
you find a Jewish couple, tell them i mme diately to 
take a taxi and go to Bespepyau(ph), Bespe
pyau Hospital, where they would be offered 
hospitality and put into hi ding.  One place he fo
und another fr iend student  of his a student, a 

fellow of his and they said, well it can't be, you 
know, that's how the Jewish reaction was to the 
unintelligible.  Of course, ______________ it mu st be ________ against na ture.  And again he 

told me  years later that it broke him to weepi
ng, simply because...so then the father, the father 

said, you're my friends, you're my s ons friends and if you say, we believe it and then to the 

car(ph) and went out to the hospi
tal.  In one case he told me  
that he found an old, old lady and 
took her to the hospital and suddenl
y she got a fit of hysterics... 
Q: ...anxiety? 

A: ...anxiety, that's right.  She had forgotten th
e garments which she had prepared for her burial. 
Q: The shroud(ph)? 

A: The shroud, yes.  She had forgotten this in her 
home  and she insisted to 
go back to  pick it up 
and there was a big commotion and the head of 
the rescue operation there(ph), who later became 
ma yor, lord ma yor of Copenhagen, he told 
my friend _______, I prohibit you to go back, it's 

dangerous, you must leave without
 the shroud, you know.  Our friend 
still went back to pick up 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0065  
24 
 
the shroud and delivered it to her.  There wherelots of small incidents where people really 
showed some kind of... 

Q: ...sensitivity 

A: sensitivity or empathy with the people who...anyw
ay that's  the story.  Th
e story is that night 
we stayed with our friends, we couldn't  stay mor e  than one ni ght at one pl ace because, you 

know.  Now we know in retrospect that the German
s acted totally different than they acted in 
other occupied countries.  But we had to prepare 
for the worst, so we had to ma ke all kinds of 
decisions because we believed that this was 
a serious ma tter for the Germans.  Now we know 
that they were all common interest in the Germ
an camp which enabled us to escape to Sweden, 
but it's quite obvious that half the Germans acted 
with the sa me will power.  The same , the same  
organizational talent which they used in prosecu
ting, persecuting Jews in 
other countries.  Of 
course they would have caught us, but we didn't 
know so we had to act as if...by the way this is 
also true for the Danes.  Afte
r the war there was the inclinatio
n to say, well anyhow the Danes 
are not such great heroes, but the _________ of 
the Danes were caught, 
those few that were 
caught got two or three weeks of prison by the 
Danish authorities.  You know, we still had 
Danish courts, we didn't have Germa n courts
.  Looking at most of the Jews, only 500 were 
arrested, the rest were _________.  It's true th
at the conditions were _________ in our favor and 
in the favor of the Danes who helped us to re
scue.  But one has to go back and look at the 
situation as it were in as fa
r as we could know and all the Danes who came to our help.  They 
had no reason to believe that th
ey did not risk their lives.  A
nd in other countries like Poland, 
France, Germany and anybody hiding a Jew was stood 
up against the wall and shot.  So I really 
think that this was a very he
roic chapter in Danish hist
ory.  But we ________ thousands of 
things, well, could believe that th
ey were ready to risk their live
s and save  the Jews.  The fact 
that they didn't (ph) do it come s, th
at we learn after the war.  But this doesn't  change the fact that 

they were justified believing that  they acted as heroes. 

Q: But the Germans di d capture some , didn't  they? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0065  
25 
 
A: They captured about 5 hundred 
and about 6,500 came ove r.  Now in our case, we shifted from 
the first hiding place to another.  We  went down 
the coast.  This was like animals do looking for 
escape routes.  You go by the smell, you know, 
and you go by instinct you went down to the 
coast because the only place that you could hide, alongthe coast and hope to be able to get to the 

only place that mi ght receive you and protect 
you was Sweden.  And the sound(ph) between 
Denmark and Sweden is not very wide, but it r
ecovered by the distance from
 the Danish coast to 
Sweden territory water could be covered by a qui
ck boat in less than half an hour.  But it was 
beyond our imagination.  There lies Denmark which 
is hidden in the darkne
ss and just across this 
narrow sound was neutral Sweden with lights and 
with chocolate and bananas and what not.  But 
_________ began to realize that there 
were people who were able to 
live another kind of life that 
we were.  But we went down to the coast hoping 
that we could escape this way of course and 
hapbeny(ph), the Swedish governme nt who had, by the way, not been welcoming to Romney 

refugees in 42's and early 43 issued a decl
aration during these H________ days welcoming all 
Jews saying that they could come  to Swedish pr
otection.  The fact is that the Swedish not only 
ma de statements to that effect, but they also
 acted accordingly because
 Swedish patrol boats 
from the navy went out took the Swedish to the 
borderline and the mo me nt that Danish boats 
crossed this borderline the Swedish boats imme diatel
y came to protect them.  
So that in case that 
Germans, I mean, you had to account for all ___________.  In case a German patrol boat would 

try to encroach on Swedish wate
rs to catch a fleeing refugee 
boat the Swedes would simply 
intervene.  But anyhow we went to the coast... 

Q: Wa it, where on the coast? 

A: It was a pl ace called Sletten, S-L-E-double T-E-N,
 which is not far away.  I mean very close, 
it's fishing, to the museum of Ca
tipriod(ph) called Louisiana.  Th
en we went to the fisherma n 
with whom we had stayed for years during our 
summer vacation, plus it 
was a rule that they 
sublet the houses to people from town, then 
they move into a house in
 the back yard, during 
these two months of summer vacat
ion.  And of course he knew us well and he offered us 
hospitality that we could have wanted because he
 didn't use a telephone.  We believed that this 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0065  
26 
 
was real, this was for real, you didn't use a tele
phone, you didn't  speak to any strangers, you're 
afraid of mo ving on the roads because you were 
afraid of ending up in the arms of German 
patrol , there were Germa ns all over the place, sold
iers ma inly.  Only later we know that the army 
decided not to interfere, not to ta
ke part in the acts against the Jews.  So the German army for its 
own reasons of interest did not allow for the Jews
, wanted to protect the Jews, but simp ly for its 
own interests the German army only had one case th
at's  known to have participated in this anti-
Jewish action.  This was left to
 the police and the, what do you ca
ll it, the visheyesteins(ph), the 
what the German counter intelligence, whatever it 
is the, Estit(ph), it's cal
led Estit(ph).  So the 
very fact that the army was all around didn't interfere.  This we  couldn't have known either.  So 
we took hiding at this place and one night he had 
negotiated with another fisherma n to take us 
across to Sweden.  We were told that  late at 
night to move across the coastal road and go down 
to the beach and wait under a sma
ll bridge to be picked up.  We 
were standing there freezing, my 
parents, my father, my mother and my three 
sisters and brother and 
we heard the doc(ph), 
doc(ph), doc, doc [sound of approaching boat], of
 the fishing boat approaching the docks of 
course the lights are on us.  I mean today we'r e s
itting in a warm room, t his thing 50 years behind 
us, it's diffi cult to imagine a family all on its
 own alone, without any protection standing on a 
small wooden bridge looking into
 the water waiting for the doc, doc, doc, doc to come to pick 
them up.  But anyhow, the boat appears from the da
rkness and we are all al
ready to jump at the 
boat and it simply passed by and it went to a br
idge where another Jewish fa mily was waiting 
and picked them up and off it went to Sweden.  Of
 course we never learned what the reason was, 
ma ybe these people could have paid them more
 money, maybe it was a mi stake.  I don't know, 
but we were standing out there in the darkness wit
hout any alternative.  So we returned to the 

fisherma n and we really did not, my father was 
responsible for the family.  These were time s 
when the fathers felt responsible, he didn't know
 what to do, we all relied on the fisherma n 
getting some kind of connection which we could use 
in order to get out.  Another night we spent 
at  a large white house with lots 
of other refugees sitt
ing in the dark sittin
g room, living room and 
the specification, the student organization, wh
ile rowing us over, rowing, can you imagine, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0065  
27 
 
ma ybe room for 2 or 3 people in these heavy 
wooden boats which they were taking from the 
fisherma n, loaned from t he fisherme n rather.  And I reme mbe r  that when our turn came, the guy 
who was supposed to row us over, this would 
take hours, I mean you could go by quick boat for 
30 mi nutes, but to be rowed over by one ma n th
at was very heavy(ph) going, two hours, and 
going for more than one trip was very difficult, bu
t these were in the days that when the crisis 

was really on these were the nice ones that 
knew that the Jewish were looking for us... 
Q: ...the Germans. 

A: The Germans, sorry, the Germans were looking 
for us.  People got scared, the Germans were 
looking for us.  And suddenly the door opened, I 
reme mber this vividly because you are on the 
edge, you're on the way of getting out of this horri
ble thing.  Then the guy, the student, who was 
supposed to take us came in a
nd we saw that blood was running 
down his palms and he said to 
my parents so we had to go back to _________.  Then
 the next day, suddenly the door bell rings, 
we of course are like mi ce sc
urrying around hiding.  I reme mb er
 one of my  brother hide a 
___________ my father had hidden under the bed.  A ve
ry undignified situation today, it's very 
hard to reme mber.  You know, that parents at that
 time were, had different 
stature(ph) then they 
do today.  For instance, in our dining room 
there was a father's chair and nobody would ever 
dream of sitting in father 's chair even if he was 
away.  Another thing that I reme mber so vividly 
is some  very painful me mory is that when we 
finally got on our way and found a reliable escape 
route it was the day after.  We r
un through a forest at night, single 
file of course, the father in 
front.  Suddenly my father slipped 
on a route or a branch and fell.  This wa s the fall of, this was 

the fall, suddenly seeing your father in this, he wa
s always in control, the 
provider, the protector, 
suddenly seeing him in a situation with this fa
lling you know at the time 
when the whole family 
was relying on him, you know, this is some thing whic
h still today can give me  the creeps.  But at 

any rate, the door bell rang and the fisherma n we nt
 out to answer the door, 
because in those days 
if you didn't open the door, they would break in. 
 At any rate, if you didn't open the door, as I 

said, they would break them in.  So he went 
out and opening the door and a voice asked, as we 

heard from inside, "is the fa mily Pundik here?" 
 Of course the fisherma n says, "no, no, no, I don't 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0065  
28 
 
know anything about Pundik, I haven't seen them 
since summer."  My father recognized the 
voice and he took a chance and said, "yes we are.
"  He took a chance because we were without 
___________ and turned to chances.  The guy come s in, another business friend of my fathers, 
who by the way his son was collabo
rated with the German Nazis, 
a very strange situation.  And 
this guy, by the way, he way limping, walking with 
a stick.  He  had walked from Elsenor(ph) 
along the coast knocking a
ll doors available asking the same
 question, "have you seen the Pundik 
fa mily?"  He couldn't know if we had escaped 
already, but he simply, you know, that is the way 

that people had to act it was a moral imperative fo
r them to act, so he did this impossible thing 
and found a needle in the haystack.  He went
 along the coast asking, he knocked on the door 
where we were and happily my father recognized 
the voice and said that I'll come  get you tonight 
when it is dark in a doctor's car, in a physician's car was permitted by the Germans to move 

around freely came and picked us up and took us 
to his home.  A place called Ultzgolden(ph) 
which is about 15 kilome ter north of Elsenor(ph)
.  He lived in a house facing the coastal road 
which was facing the sea.  And at night, the nextday he negotiated a deal 
with the fisherman, at 
the night we were told to rush across the coasta
l road and go down to the 
sea.  And there was a 
small rowboat waiting there for us, we jumped in
to the boat, there was a larger motor fi shing 
boat waiting just a few hundred me ters from the co
ast and we were rowed out to the fishing boat 

and I reme mber two things.  I reme mber that I 
turned around and had a last look at Denmark and 
on the beach were kneeling with thei r hands raised in a kind of praying position were the 

fisherma n's wife and the follow who had saved us, 
my father's  business friend and his wife, they 
were believing(ph) people, prayi
ng.  Another thing that I reme mb
er was maybe only that time  I 
showed a knack for journalism, I looked at my
 watch the mo ment the mo tor started operating 

and we were heading for Swedish territory wate
rs and I reme mber that it took us exactly 37 
mi nutes to go from Denmark into safety to Swedis
h territory water.  But some  people, I want to 
conclude with a little anecdote, some  people 
were not so lucky of course.  One of my 
predecessors, is a chief of Puting(ph), was June
(ph) Koppel, now I'll spell Koppel, K-0-double P-
E-L and he was caught by the Germans while crossi
ng the same  coastal road.  His wife who was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0065  
29 
 
not Jewish got across and was dow
n in the boat waiting for them, his two sons also, and he was 
caught by a Gestapo car headlights.
  Caught the mome nt that he 
tried to escape and they took 
him into the car and wrestled him and he was a fellow who wa s a _________ off the Copenhagen 
__________.  Even in difficult times, that while they 
were driving him off to Exenal(ph) to the 
prison, to the arrest house in Exenal(ph) one Ge
rman Gestapo ma n turned around and says, vense 
huden(ph), "are you Jewish?" and Mr. Koppe
l said, "yes, and you?"  That's it. 

Q: All right, go, I'll 
see you down there.
