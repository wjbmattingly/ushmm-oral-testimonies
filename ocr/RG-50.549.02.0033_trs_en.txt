Question: United States Holocaust Memori

This is an interview with 
Hetty DeLeeuwe, co ndu
cted by Gary Covi
no, on January 13
th
, 
1999, in Highland Park, Illinoi
s. This is a follow up in
terview to a United States 
Holo caust Memo rial Museum videotaped  in
terview conducted with Hetty DeLeeuwe. 
The United States Holocaust Me
mo rial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby 
Herr for making this interview 
possible. This is tape number one, side A. Okay , maybe 
we could just start by having 
you say your name and where we
 are, maybe what the date 
is, what the weather™s like outside.  
Answer: Well, today is the 13
th
 of January, in 1999, and we ar
e here sitting in my kitchen, 
in Highland Park, Illinois and the weather is 
awful. It™s snowing, and snow is piled up 
very, very high, and it™s wonderfu
l to be inside and not have to su ffer outside in the cold . 
And we are sitting here talking about what ha
ppened to my life afte
r we were liberated, 
and I™m ready to  ask -- answer questions, I think. 

Q: Okay . Let me -- Let me ask you to go ba
ck. You did a video in
terview about your 
experiences during the war -- 

A: Mm-hm. 

Q: -- with the museum in Wa
shington. But let™s go back a 
bit and you™ve 
talked about 
this somewhat in that intervie
w. Let™s take it back maybe to
 a couple months before the

end of the war. If you could just
 briefly describe what -- what your circumstances were, 
where you were, who you were with, a
nd what was happening at that time. 
A: Well, we were liberated in, I think the 
third of December, of 1944, by the Scottish 
army and they were followe
d by I guess British and the Am
ericans. But I don™t know 
much about that any more. Th
e -- Couple of months before that, we suffered immensely 
under real war conditions. In September they 
started dropping the troops in Arnum, and 
since I lived in Fenlow at that time, which is
n™t so far, we saw, actually it -- all the troops 
coming over in big airplanes, 
and it was on a Sunday, it was 
brilliant, sunny day, and I™ll 
never forget it, because it was just immense. 
It -- It was never ending, big airplanes and 
little airplanes, which we later on found out we
re gliders, and that™s really when our 
liberation sort of started, from that mo ment on,
 we were practically constantly under fire. 
And we -- we couldn™t go outside any mo re a
nd we didn™t have ga
s and electricity and 
things like that. And life became 
very, very difficult. I was stil
l in hiding of course, and a 
few very dangerous things happ
ened to my personally. We ha
d no food so  my  stepmo ther 
and her daughter went out
 to get food in the 
field, like cauliflowers
 an-and potatoes and 
things like that, cause the farm
ers couldn™t get it, because the 
man didn™t go outside, they 

-- the Germans were very much aware of the 
man and they wanted  them to go to  help 
them in Germany, I guess. So, and then, it 
was a couple of -- maybe -- it was in October, 
maybe then already, that some Germans ca me to the house. I was th ere with my 

stepfather, who was in bed, because he was 
on strike. The Dutch government had told all 
the people who worked for the ra
ilroad that they had to  go on 
strike, so he did. And there

was a son in the house, who was supposed tobe working for the Ge
rmans. So, he was 
also somewhere hiding in the house, so I 
had to open th e door. And th e Germans said 
they wanted to look in the 
house, and they  looked in the 
house, and they decided the 
house was good. And they told  
me they were going to  come ba
ck in the evening to live in 
our house for awhile. So, for 
about two weeks, I 
think, they lived 
with us. And they 
sometimes asked for me, but I was every night ve
ry, very tired, so when
 they came in, my 
stepmother told them that we
ll, I was so tired, I wasn™t used to doing th e housework and 
all that sort of stuff, so I always went to 
bed early. So they neve
r saw me. Course, they 
were scared that if they found out I was Je
wish, that the whole fa
mily would be killed. 
So, when the war came closer and closer, the 
Germans left, because 
they -- they stayed 
away from the real fighting appa
rently. And then in
 December, we were finally liberated, 
but that was sort of difficult too, because th
e -- the Germans had recreated all th e people 
who lived in our little town, an
d they had to all go across th
e River Maus, into Germany, 
and then  up north , into the north ern part of
 Holland. And they wa
nted all the regular 
people out of town, and they
 wanted to go -- go [indeciph
erable] us for the Americans 
and the British who were coming. So, my step
parents decided that I, who had no papers 
at all, was too mu ch  of a danger to take along 
on th at kind of a trip, and so we all went 
into hiding. The man stayed so
mewhere, I don™t know where,
 but we, the women, stayed 
in a bombed-out house, and there we stayed fo
r a couple of days. There was some food, 
there was water and that™s where we were liber
ated. And it was, of course, still very, very 
dangerous, because the troops  didn™t cross the river, and 
it was constant bombarding and

grenade fire. So, we somehow crawled to ou
r house, and then the British decided that 
they didn™t want us there, so we were evacu
ated to another town, an
d there we stayed til I 
think the middle of April. In the meantime, 
H o lland wasn™t even liberated altogether, so 
while I was in the other town
 with my step-parents, and 
the son and the daughter, we 
were free. My step-parents ke
pt on asking me, very unnotic
ed for me, rea
lly , my  n ame 
and my -- my father™s name. An
d then the next day th ey ask me my  mo ther™s name, and 
so they came -- in a 
couple of weeks they came to know who I really was, cause you 
never talked  about it and you ne
ver wrote that down. And th ey ap parently gave that to a 
Jewish organization who was 
trying to find all the childre
n. And then they -- that 
organization decided that maybe it was a good th
ing for me to go to Israel, but  -- then 
Palestine, but I didn™t want to
 hear about that, cause I wanted  to know if I still somehow, 
would find my  parents back. I had no id ea where 
they were. So, they 
-- they decided they  
were going to keep me in the house for -- I 
don™t know how lo ng, maybe they  would have 
taken me forever. And then my father, who 
was hidden in Amsterdam first, but later on 
left for northern Ho lland, somehow got hims
elf involved in underground wo rk. He was 
an artist an d he was good in doing precise pict
ures, so he put part of the province where 
he was in, an-and mapped it fo
r the underground and that was 
sent to England, so that 
when  the troops were coming, 
that they knew exactly wher
e every house was, and where 
every little obstacle would be. And then so me
how he was caught by the Germans. They  
came in the house to check something. He and 
the owner of the house were sent to prison 
because they were listening to
 the English radio when the 
Germans walked in. And thank

God my father didn™t reveal that he was Je
wish, and they never f
ound out that he was 
Jewish, so he spent a couple of months in 
jail. And had they know
n he was Jewish, they 
would, of course, have killed him instantly. Bu
t he was liberated there. And as it was, the 
troops apparently traveled with lists of ch
ildren who were liberated
. So, when my father 
came out of prison, they  somehow presented 
him with a list. And my maiden name is 
D™Ancona, D™A, and when -- in Holland, it™s 
-- the A counts as the main letter, so my 
name was on top, and my  father found out th
at I was okay. But then  the problem was he 
was up north  and I was down south and there 
was no transportation in Holland, especially 
in the part where I was, everything was da
maged and bomb ed, and there were no road s, 
there was no public transportation, no trains, 
no buses, nothing. So , since my  father had 
w o rk ed  fo r th e u n d e rg ro
und, he got some letters from impor
tant people, I would say, who 
gave him permission to travel. So he somehow 
talked himself into be
ing allowed to cross 
the rivers, and you know, on 
a bicycle without tires. And he
 came one day to -- to the 
house wh ere I was hidden, and I then lived
 in freedom. And well, he knocked on th e 
door, and we didn™t get many visitors there,
 and so when  I heard a man speak, I knew 
right away  it was my  dad. And at that time I 
found out that my  mo ther was caught by the 
Germans and th at she had gone aw ay, that sh
e was in the holding camp, Westerbork, and 
after that was sent to wherever, and that we
 had no way of knowing if my mother had 
survived. 

Q: Let me just go back for a second -- 

A: Mm-hm. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0033

Q: The place where you were at in the country -- 
A: Yeah? 
Q: -- who were these people you were with, if 
your parents were still in Amsterdam, were 
-- who were you with?  
A: When  I was in hiding? 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Well, my par -- we were -- we were -- we a
ll went in hide -- in hiding at same time. I 
was taken by an organization to
 the southern  part of Ho lland,
 and to a family that I had 
never met in my  life, didn™t know the people, and -- 

Q: You say an organization, do you know th
e name of it, or who those people were? 
A: Ah, well they called them Emfay, which is 
in Dutch, the same as
 LTD. And the -- the 
organization was started by a man, Mr. Debr
own, wh ich was not hi
s real name, and he 
had helpers, young man and young wo men, wh
o took the kids from the Germans. When -
- When you were picked
 up from your home in Amsterdam,
 small children were put in a -
- sort of what -- what used to be a school, 
and the parents were acro
ss the stree t in what 
used to be a theater. And then
, before they went on trans
port to Westerbork, and those 
children, those  young children 
were taken care of by Jewish people, mo st likely, I think, 
nurses, and people who took care of kids. 
And they went out for walks sometimes. And 
the organization had made it their busin ess to 
steal some of those ch
ildren. So , every day 
when  some of those kids were walked outside 
to get a little fresh air, -- and I™m sure that 
it was prearranged with  help in side, that cert
ain children were going to
 be taken away. So  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0033

they had as many clothes on as possible. And 
then they walked at 
the end of the line, 
cause there were like maybe 10 
or 15 kids, and then at the 
end, and then those young 
people came and just stole them away. And ho
w th ey organized getting 
rid of their papers 
and -- I have no idea. I guess that™s known in -- in Holland how it went, but those 
children were just rescued. And I was still at 
home. I was one of the very, very last in 
Amsterdam, who lived in their own house a
nd that was because we are Sephardic. My 
father and my  mo ther both are from Sephardic 
descent, and the Germans, with all their 

crazy rules and regulations had, at some poi
nt said that most of
 the Sephardine were 
going to  be descendants from Aranos, wh ich mo st
 likely was true, and we were not really 
Jews, we were Christians. So, my parents tried 
everything in the world to get us declared 
non-Jews, not because they didn™
t want to be Jews, but you 
know, it was important not to 
have to go to the other side of the world.
 I don™t know what -- what my parents knew 
about wh at was waiting on the other side of the 
fence. I didn™t know an awful lot, because 
as much as possible was kept away from me
. But I knew, and everybody knew that, that 
it wasn™t very good. So, we were in Holla
nd; in Amsterdam still quote quote free, in 
October of 1990 -- in 1943 were -- and was 
practically no Jew left 
in Amsterdam walking 
the streets. There was no school any more, a
nd th ere was no organiz -- organized life for 
Jews any mo re. So, on the 16
th
 of October, my father decided that since we weren™t 
declared non-Jews, we had to go
. So, my  father found this organization and th ey said they 
would have a place for me. So
, on mon -- and one morning 
they came -- and the lady 
came to pick me up and she took me along to 
the station and there sh e handed me to a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0033
 
 
9
 
 
 
young man, and he took me on the train with 
another child that I never saw again, and we 
traveled a long distance. We ha
d to  change the pla -- the train in the station and we took 
another train. Then we finally came at the de
stined place and this 
young man said to me, 
ﬁWell, you just wait here.ﬂ And he took th
e young man with him and came back maybe 
three quarters of an hour later, half an hour later, without the young man, but that a -- that 
time that I had to wait at that
 station was like -- like a year. 
It was never ending, and here 
I was, I was in -- I mean, I was 13 years old.
 I was -- I was child, but I was -- I was aware 
of the dangers. I had no name, I didn™t know 
where I lived, I -- I -- I -- I was n o body, and 
if they -- somebody had come up to me a nd said, ﬁWhere are you going, wh at are you 

doing, are you waiting for some
body?ﬂ I couldn™t say anything. So, I was very, very 
scared. And then when he came 
back, he came on back with a -- with a bicycle, so I went 
with him on the bicy cle and he dropped me o
ff at this family. And 
there I stayed for the 

rest of the year and -- and another year. 
And I was very, very different from my own 

home. I came from a middle class family, nothi
ng very fancy, but these people, the man 
was working for the railroad, he repaired railr
oad cars. And they were fine people, there™s 

nothing to s -- be said about 
them, they were risking their 
life for me, they knew what 
they were doing. And they were
 terrific. But it was an altogether different life th an what I 
was used to. They  were going to church  all 
the time, they read th
e Bible, they prayed 
every day and I wasn ™t used to that at all, 
cause my  parents were atheist, and -- not that 
they wanted to deny 
they were Jewish, but there was ab
solutely no religion in my house, 
and so -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0033
 
 
10
 
 
 
Q: And these people were not Jewish, 
that you™re with, or they are? 
A: No, no, no, they were Christians. 
Q: Yeah, right. 

A: They were Christians wher
e I lived now. So , everything wa
s different, and of course I 
-- I had just said goodbye to my parents, my
 father and my  mo ther, and I knew very well 
that that wasn™t all that sure
 that I would ev er going to  see 
them again. So, at -- it was 
very traumatic, and -- but I had to adjust, I had no choice. 

Q: When  you -- Wh en you were in this hous
e, with these people that you™d never met 
before and they™re not from your backgroun
d, and they ™re not from your religion or 
whatever, but they -- did you rea
lize at the time how much of a 
risk they were taking to -- 
A: Oh, I knew that, yeah, hundred percent, ye
ah, I knew that if so
me body was going to 
come, that th-the man would most likely be kille
d, and the son, who was 16 or so at that 
time, would have had a hard time, too, 
and maybe the whole fa
mi ly. You never knew 
what the Germans were going to
 d o .  B u t, no , th ey  kn ew  v e
ry well what they did, and 
after the war, I asked them why did you do th
is? And then my stepmo
ther told me that 
somebody who was sent by one of the clergy in
 that town , came to their house and asked 
if they would take a child, a 
Jewish child. And she was willi
ng to say yes right away, but 
she thought it was prudent to ask her husband 
if he was thinking th e same way. So, she 
said, ﬁWell, you have to wait til my husb
and comes home from work and I can tell you 
tonight.ﬂ So , as it happened, their oldest dau
ghter was going to leave home, and that is 

very important because in t
hose days, you couldn™t buy beds, you couldn™t buy linens, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0033
 
 
11
 
 
 
you couldn™t buy blankets, yo
u couldn™t buy anything, even if you had the money, it 
wasn™t available, and so they could only take
 me if they had a spare bed. So  when the 
daughter left, I could take her place, so  they told the man who came from the 
underground, they could only have a girl, b
ecause I could stay with their other daughter 
in the same room. So that™s how come I found 
this place, or they found the place for me. 
Q: And in this place, where these people w
ho were, at first anyway, are strangers, and 
they™re [indecipherable] 
A: It was very strange. 
Q: I was going to ask you, wh
at was it like to be there? Ho w did you act, how did you 
feel? Did you feel quickly like part of the fa
mily, did you kind of 
keep to yourself, how 
did they react? You know, what was that lik e? That™s a strange situation to be in. 

A: It™s -- It™s -- It™s -- It™s an awful situ
ation to be in cause, number one, I was very 
nervous that I had left my  pare
nts, and that this -- this -- this whole town was -- was -- 
you know, it was so different 
from a big city, and everything 
in  tha-that household was 
different than -- than in my house, and I -- I wa
s -- I™m an only child, 
so I wasn™t used to 
brothers and sisters, and once I was settled a 
little bit, you know, they  started to tease me 
and I wasn™t used to that at all. And I don™
t think I™ve cried a lot, because ed -- I knew -- I 
was old enough to realize that cry ing wasn™t 
going to  help. And I knew also that I had to 
behave myself and that I couldn™t be this spoi
led brat and that I had to adjust, because if I 
didn™t do that, maybe the people wouldn™t wa
nt to keep me, and where was I going to go 
then? I had nowh ere to go. And that is the -- 
an -- an awful feeling. If -- If they had put 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0033
 
 
12
 
 
 
me out on th e street, I wouldn™t have had an
y place to go. I was far, far, far away from 
even non-Jewish friends that I knew, but I ha
d no money, I had no papers, I had -- I had 
nothing. And I think th at was the scariest part, 
that I had to really be as perfect as could 
be, because I couldn™t risk any 
problems in that house, so wh
en they teased me I had to 
take it and they didn™t do th at 
to be mean to me, but they were just used to it and I was 
not. I couldn™t go to school. The daughter we
nt to a parochial school, but that was a long 
walk and there was no transportation at that 
time any more either. So
, they didn™t want 
me to risk that big long walk
 to  school. So  I had to stay 
home and in the beginning I tried 
to do a little bit of my schoolwork, but my head wasn™t there. So, 
my stepmother said, 
ﬁWell, I didn™t get you in here to be my  maid
, but maybe it would be a good idea to help 
me once in awhile.ﬂ So I -- I helped my st
epmo ther with making the beds, and in those 
days, everything was breaking, so we had 
to sew a lot and mend a lot and I™m pretty 
handy when it comes to that, so
 I helped and I liked that. And I loved to scrub, so I -- I 
learned a lot. I learned a lot of things that
 my  mo ther never would have taught me, and 
that came in handy later, I think. So, I -- I ha
d to do things during the day, cause I was 

bored  stiff otherwise. And so my  stepmo ther
 and I got along very well. When she went 

shopping, she sho -- mo st of the time took me along, cause she wouldn™t let me home 

alone, and so we went shopping and -- but ther
e wasn™t much to sh
op, so we didn™t do 
that too much. And so that was 
the -- my  daily job, to help and do as mu ch as I could to  -- 
to not be a nuisance. 

Q: What were the names of these people? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0033
 
 
13
 
 
 
A: They are the Shumachers. No, they are not alive any more. My stepfather died years 
and years ago. My stepmother died a few ye
ars ago. And she had willed that -- she had 
asked her ch ildren th at when  she was going to  be
 gone -- in Holland it™
s usually that they 
send out cards that somebody has passed away 
and an ad  goes in the newspaper and she 
had asked the children if they wo uld resent it th
at sh -- they also pu
t my   n ame i n  as a 
daughter. So they didn™t mind, and so wh en sh
e died, we flew over for her funeral. And I 
had to sit right in front in the church, and 
th e pastor knew  about it, he -- he mentioned 
what they had done for me, and that I was there,
 and that they really 
looked at me as their 
daughter, even though I wasn™t th
eir -- their real daughter. But,
 they were very, very kind 
to me, and up to  now, we are still friends w
ith the children, and th
e daughter who is the 
youngest, was my best friend, really, because
 we -- we were together all the time. I™m 
going to  see her next week. And the daughter 
who left home and made room fo r me, is 
very, very ill and I™m going to meet her next 
week, too. She™s in a nursing home and I™m 

going to  say hello to  her, too, of course. 
Q: This is over there, or -- 
A: That™s in The Netherlands
, that™s in Holland, yeah. 
Q: What were their first names, this family? 

A: He was Johann an d she was Aleida and then
 they had three children, Cynthia, Bowk er 
and Yozeem. And the parents are honored 
in the Holocaust mu
seum and they are 
mentioned on the wall upstairs as Righteous 
Gentiles, and they are mentioned in Yad 
Vashem. I never get -- they got there, a big 
medal at one time, presented by Yad Vashem, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0033
 
 
14
 
 
 
as being Righteous
 Gentiles, and having saved my life.
 So, after the war, when we were 
liberated, and my father had come to my ho
use where I was hidden, he -- he took me 
along up north, where he had been  living all 
that time, b ecause we really didn™t know 
what we were going to do. And there was a lo
t of food in the north, and where we were, 
there was not so mu ch. So my  father took me  along and after maybe 
two or three weeks, 
we got a telephone call from Amsterdam, th
at somehow, miraculously, my  mo ther had 
appeared. She had traveled for weeks, coming 
back  from Austria, but she had arrived in 
Amsterdam and was looking fo r us. So, then my
 father and I went back to Amsterdam on 
a milk truck. And my  mo ther 
was like unreal. She was skinny and she used to  be pretty 
well rounded and she looked scary, and like a 
witch, sort of. And I was -- I was really 
scared of her. But, a-after a couple of days that
 -- I got used to it. Now, we didn™t have a 
house at that time. She came to her brother™shouse, and so we were there, too, and --  
Q: You say your mo ther arrived -- 

A: Yeah. 
Q: -- suddenly -- 
A: Yeah.

A: Scary and like a witch, sort of, and I wa

couple of days that -- I got used to it. Now,
 we didn™t have a house at that time, she came 
to her brother™s house, and so 
we were there too, and --

happened? Di-Did you ha
ve any knowledge that
 she was still alive? 
A: No. 

Q: Did you think th at 
she did not surviv ed? 
A: No, no, we didn™t 
think she had surviv ed. 
Q: So you th ought she was dead? 
A: Yeah, yeah. 
Q: And then she appears? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Well, that™s an asto unding expe
rience. What -- What was that like? 

A: Unreal, unreal. We -- We -- We didn™t kn
ow where my  mo ther had gone. We knew 
my mother was caught at the 
place where she was in hiding,
 and after jail and I don™t 
know what else, she en ded up in
 -- in Westerbork, in that 
camp before you go to -- to 
Germany or Poland. And since we had had this
 stamp in our papers, that we were most

likely not Jewish, and merranos and all that so
rt of stuff, which was like an exemption, 
my  mo ther had had th at in her papers and th
e Germans didn™t first want to recognize that, 
but when she was in that camp,
 with the help of friends wh
o lived there for quite awhile, 
they recognized that. So, my mo
ther was sent to Theresiensta
dt, and that was sort of the 
show camp for the Germans. A
nd that -- My father knew that she had been  sent to 
Theresienstadt. But we also knew, after 
the war, that not ev erybody stayed in 
Theresienstadt, and so for th
e rest, we had no knowledge of
 wh at had happened  to my  
mother. My -- My mother came 
back, though, she told us wh
at had happened , and she did 
the rounds. She stayed 
in -- She was caught in July of ™4
4, wh ich mo st likely is why she 
was still alive, because it was sort of at
 the end of the war. She -- She went from 
Theresienstadt to Auschwitz, and there she st
ayed for about two we
eks. And she didn™t 
talk much about that, 
but when she did talk about it, sh
e said it was hell, and it was worse 
than hell. They sort of stay
ed together, 10 Dutch women, a
nd wh at was the best thing in  
Auschwitz was that if there was a transport 
to go somewh ere else, cause nothing could be 
worse than Auschwitz. 
So, one evening, all the people wh
o knew about that there was a 
transport going, were lining up outside 
somewhere. And another story goes that 
everybody who is up front ends 
up going on transport, and th
e ones who are left over are 
going to be killed, that they knew. Howeve
r, the Germans liked doing nasty things, so 
when  all those women are fighting and -- 
and -- and -- and bein
g excited about going 
away from Auschwitz, were standing in line, th
ey let them turn around, so the ones who 
were standing in  front were standing in  the 
back and the ones who standing in  back were 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0033
 
 
17
 
 
 
standing up front. That saved my mother™s lif
e, because my  mo ther otherwise would have 
been in the back, inst
ead of in the front. Then she was 
transported to Lanzing, which was 
-- I guess nobody knows about that
 concentration camp . It was part of Mauthausen, in 
Austria. And there she had to 
work in a factory where they
 made rayon for parachutes. 
Very poisonous. People who work in that kind of an industry
 have to get extra food, have 
to drink a lot of milk, can™t do it more than 
so many months, I guess, in a year, and there 
are strict rules, but for Jewish women that 
wasn™t important, so they didn™t get fed, and 
they had to work  very  hard. They  burned th
eir skin and they were nauseous and sick 
sometimes, because all the pois
onous gases and whatever. They
 -- My mother was fluent 
in German, and that sort of helped them, too,
 I think. My mo ther was -- I don™t know ab -
- if she was -- ca -- you can say she was a 
boss, but she was a teacher and so she knew 
how to be ahead of the group, 
and so she told th
e Germans off whenever she could. And 
they sabotaged a lot, too, cause if you put 
your finger on those instruments, then the 
whole thing messed up, and they ruined  I don™
t know how much. And 
so they were good 
at that. And somehow my
 mother survived, even
 though she got very, 
very ill there. They 
operated on her without any an
esthesia, any -- any medicine, nothing. And ev en though 

the German doctor who di
d it wanted to kill her, I™m sure, he
 saved her life, because if he 
hadn™t done that, I™m sure she would have
 died. So, by th e time 
she was liberated, she 
was very, very ill, but the Americans took enor mous good care of them. They sent them 

to hospitals, they had them x
-rayed. Everybody who had TB wa
s sent to a sanitorium, and 
the -- the medical staff of, I guess the military, to
ok care of the prisoners. They stumbled

on th is group of wo men. Now, my  mo ther 
was with those 10 -- of which one had passed 
away, but there were also lo
ts of Hungarian women in  that group, and I don™t know 
where those americ -- the -- where those Ameri
cans really took them
. My mother talked 
about flying to, I think southern Germany, 
and from there they were transported through 
Switzerland, to France, and ther
e they stayed for awhile, and 
then they came
 to Holland. 
But you have a -- imagine that there was ab
solutely no normal transportation. Railroads 
were bombed, and so  it was very hard to get 
a train together and th-there wa -- there was 
no infrastructure whatsoever, so there was no 
mail. My mother wrote every day and we 
never got those letters, until m onths and months later, after 
she had arrived. And then 
when we all three were back 
in Amsterdam, we didn™t r
eally know what to do. Our 
busin ess was dismantled, all our belongings 
were taken away. And somehow my  father 
started again. He -- He got some help, I 
think, from the Marshall fund. That -- That 
wasn™t something th at they gave you, ee 
-- it was like loans. And in the same h ouse 
where we used to live, we ca
me back. But we had no fu rnitu
re, we had no beds, we had 
no clothes, and -- 
Q: Your house was still there? Other people hadn™t -- 

A: Well, it was -- but -- 

Q: -- taken it, or -- 
A: -- n-no, other people had lived in our 
house, but the Germans had taken everything 
away. Practically everything was gone and s -- a few -- very, very fe
w things were hidden 
with friends, and we got that back, but some
times you didn™t get that back either, cause 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0033
 
 
19
 
 
 
people were used to having it and they didn™t 
want to give it back. But we basically were 
homeless and -- and penniless. And my  father was 
in his 40™s, in his late 40™s, and he had 
to start all over again, which he did, but 
it was so difficult, because your support was 
gone. Everything th at -- that used to be n-nor
mal ju -- before the wa
r, and during the vi -- 
first year, maybe, of the war, was gone. My 
grandparents were gone. All my  uncles and 
aunts were gone, all my cousins were gone, al l my  friends were gone. My parents friends 
were gone. You -- You had nowh
ere to go. That what -- was 
very lonely existence. And 
now, after 50-plus years, you -- 
you wonder how we did it. We 
didn™t talk about what we 
had lost, we didn™t talk about how terrible it 
was. It was something that wasn™t talked 
about and you ju st sort of try to make the be
st of everything. And my  mo ther was sort of 
not normal when  she first ca
me back. She -- And she never was going to  get to dress 
decent any more, who need
ed it, and who wanted to wear 
stockings, hose. or things like 
that, th-that wasn™t necessary
. But after maybe half a year, she was sort of the old 
mo mmy  ag ain ,  an d  -- 
Q: What do -- What do you 
think was going on? Do you thi
nk maybe she was depressed? 
A: No, I don™t know, my mother
 wasn™t depressed. No, she -- 
she was stronger than that. 
No, she had had typhus in -- in the camps, an
d I guess she was just so undernourished and 
so -- had been so sick that it took a long tim
e to recover from that. And they  had suffered 
so mu ch, of course, and she never talked 
about much, cause I™ve a-asked my children 
about wh at did Omar ever tell you, and she 
never talked about cam
ps with them. She 
never talked  about the war, but we never talked
 about we missed this
 person, or how sad 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0033

the way our family came to thei
r end. It -- It was just a subj
ect that wasn™t touched. And I 
guess that it took many, many, many, many year
s before anybody could talk about it, and 
realized that we all buried that inside us.  
Q: Why -- Why do you think y
ou all did that? Why did you not
 talk about it, why did you 
keep it inside? What
 do you think? 
A: It was -- It wa -- wa -- It was to o awes
ome, it was too -- too big a problem. I don™t 
think anybody could understand
 it, how it could have happened , wh y it happened. It wit -
- It was so unreal, it was somethi ng that nobo
dy wanted to -- to understand, and I think 
that basically -- I™m not a psychologist, but I think that basically, ev erybody felt guilty 

that the -- the few that -- of us who did surviv
e, did su rvive. And I still have that myself, 
too. I so many times ask my self, why did I surv
ive and not my  very best friend, or m-my  
very dear cousin ? It -- It -- It™s such a terri
ble thing that happened, that it™s -- it™s -- you -- 
you can™t explain it. And so  I think it was so 
painful, and it hurted so much, that we just 

figured, don™t talk about it, and maybe it goes aw
ay. The truth ath -- is that with the years, 
I think th e -- the pain never goes aw ay and yo
u keep on missing those people. I -- I -- I™m 
fixated with my  gran dmother, and I was a ki
d when she died, and I -- I have -- I™ve -- I 
talk to her in my mind, and I -- I can see her 
still in her house, in my mind. And I -- I -- I 
just have problems sometimes wi
th why, why did all those peop
le have to be killed? They 
were all honest, hard working, were not in
 anybody™s way and they were just regular 
citizens lik e the rest, and it™s -- it™
s some th -- very, very  troublesome part of a life, and it 
-- I don™t think it will ever go away . I mean, I 
live a very comfortable life now, and I have 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0033
 
 
21
 
 
 
-- thank God I have -- I have a family, but 
that pain will never go away, that always 
comes back somehow. And, if 
you live in a -- in a society 
like we are living here, you 
realize what you™re mi ssing, too, because pe
ople have like school gatherings, you know, 
they have reunions of their school. And -- An
d they have family affairs and you see 40 - 
50 - 60 people coming, maybe even  mo re, and I 
have nobody. I have a cousin in Toronto, 
and that™s my closest relative. And all my un
cles, all my  aunts, my cousins, they™re all 
gone. And maybe they were not 
my best friends, but that -- that part of your life is so 
empty. And you don™t realize it every second 
of the day, but you kn
ow it™s there. And if 
there are happy occasions in 
your family, you can™t share it with relatives. Now, thank 
God, we have good friends
 here, but it™s still differe
nt than your own family. 
Q: Mm-hm. How do you feel a
bout what -- it™s sort of two 
questions in one, how do you 
feel about Germany and Germ
ans? And how do you feel about -- I mean, you had one 
particular experience, how do
 you feel about the people 
from your own co untry, from -- 
people from The Netherlands, not the Jews, but
 the other people, and how they  behaved? 
A: Well, that™s a tough one. I prefer not to 
go to s -- Germany. I -- I can™t hold it against 
young people, or people my  own age for that
 matter, so mo st of the Germans who did 
what they did, are not around any more. Ho
wever, when I see or meet a German, I can 
think in the back of my  mind, maybe your
 grandfather or your father did to my  
grandparents or my  uncles and aunts, which 
is the unthinkable, bu
t they did it. And I 
can™t hold it against anybody, but
 I™m not very comfortable w
ith Germans, I have to be 
really honest. I wouldn™t drive in a -- in 
a Mercedes. I -- I would think of a staff car, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0033
 
 
22
 
 
 
especially when it™s black, I would think, ﬁO
h, that™s the SS.ﬂ Or the [indecipherable] 
polici. A crazy thing, I cannot have a Krupp 
coffee maker or a Krupp any machine in my  
house. I have a Brown coffeemaker, also co
mes from Germany, but it doesn™t have the 
same connotation as Krupp. Kr
upp is a bad word  in my imagination, so I don™t want to 
see it in my house, I can™t stand that. 
Q: Because of all the war industries? 

A: Of all the war, and -- and -- and -- and what
 they did to us. Ab out the Dutch, I don™t 

think I feel as strongly a-about the Dutch, as
 about the Germans, but I know now that the 
Dutch, as a whole, could have done a lo
t mo re, including our queen . Queen Wilh emina 
never talked  about an ything, no
t on the -- on the English radi
o, about stand up ag ainst the 
Germans, try to help  your Jewish neighbors.
 Never, ever that that came about, and th ey 
turned to her, then th
ey thought, ﬁWell, it™s too danger
ous to help the Jews.ﬂ I mean, I 
was too young to realize all t
hose things maybe then, but when  you th ink about it, when 
you™re a grown-up and an adult, you wonder 
why not mo re people had tried to help. On 
the other hand, I know that it was extremel
y dangerous, because Jewish doctors only 
could t-take care of Jewish patients and non 
-Jewish docto rs couldn™
t take care of non-
Jewish -- of Jewish patients. Everything wa
s segregated and we had never had th at in 

Holland. Ho lland was a very liberal country . As 
a matter of fact, my  ancestors came to 
Holland after the Inquisition, a
nd Holland welcomed them. It™s
 -- It™s -- It -- It™s very 
hard to -- to really judge and to say, well 
they could have saved mo re, because everybody 
knew that if they did help Jews, they would 
be punished like Jews. On th e other hand, if 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0033
 
 
23
 
 
 
lots of people would have stuck togethe
r, maybe they would ha
ve been able to 
accomplish more. In Belgiu
m they did a lot more for the Je
ws than they did in Holland. 
And it™s -- it -- it -- it sh -- true it wasn™t publicized, I mean, so
 most of the Jews lived in 
the big cities, Amsterd am, Rotterdam, maybe 
The Hague, and in so me s -- all over the 
country. And th e -- the population in -- in 
the smaller to wns, mi
ght not have known 
exactly what happened to the Je
ws, but the masses in -- in th
e big cities, did know. They 
saw it. I mean, part of Amsterdam was cord
oned off and n
obody could move, and th ey 
went house to house and house, an-and pick
ed up the Jews. And i-it was -- it was a very 
difficult thing. I can™t blame 
them hundred percent becaus
e I know how dangerous it was 
to help Jews. On the other ha
nd, you would have liked to 
had a little more help from the 
masses. And they did it once wh en  they ha
d the strike, when the first Jewish young 
people were picked up, they had a strike
 in Amsterdam, all the municipal workers 
stopped working and it was a ma ss demonstrati
on that day, and th ere was is a monument, 
[indecipherable] dock work
er in Amsterdam, to remind us of
 that. And that was fantastic, 
but it was one day, and then they  went back  
to work, and the German
s went back to pick  
up Jews. So, it™s -- I can™t say that I -- I -- I h ate
d the Dutch people for it, but in hindsight, 
you could say they could have
 done a little more for us. 
Q: But I take it, for instance
, if you bought a Philip™s VCR or so mething, th at you don™t 
ban Dutch products from the house, the 
way you might so me German products? 
A: No, no, no.  

Q: You were, you know, a -- a younger wo man 
during the war wh en all this happened. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0033
 
 
24
 
 
 
A: Mm. 
Q: What -- When  did you first  hear about 
and wh at was your reaction when  say, Anne 
Frank™s diary was published? 
A: I don™t think I read it for many, many years,
 and I ha -- I don™t think I have read it all 
together. I -- I -- I™ve seen it and I™ve 
taken a few pages he
re and there.  
Q: Did you know ab out it when it 
was first published, or later? 
A: Yeah, I guess so, yeah, I guess so. And th
ere™s a lot of controversy about it now, 
unbelievable. I think it was a beautiful thing,
 because it gave the wo rld insight of what 
happened to us, and how -- ho
w people who absolu
tely had nothing wrong done, were 
convicted and -- and -- and -- and -- and -- and 
persecuted . And it give the -- the world an  
insight of what -- what it was all about. But,
 still I don™t think th e -- the -- the pain that 
came afterwards comes out of that, because th
at™s not what she ex perienced. She was one 
or two years older than I was, and I knew her, because she 
lived in a neighborhood where 
I used to live, and I had a friend th ere, so 
I -- I knew her so ve-v
e-very -- very casual. 
[indecipherable] 

Q: Oh, so you actually
 knew her personally? 
A: Yeah, well -- well very casual, I mean, if
 y -- if you would -- I -- I -- I know she lived 
there and we played outside once, or twic e maybe, you know. You know, all those little 
kids there in the neig hborhood. Bu t, you 
know, she was a very nice kid, but very  
intelligent that she could write about it the way sh e did. I was not able to do that in those 
years, I wasn™t that -- that verbal and 
I wasn ™t good at writing, or anything.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0033

Q: Had you known at all, at the time or late
r, right after the war, what had happened with  
her family, how they  had hid, and how mo st of 
them had not surv ived  or wh atever, or di -
- di -- they -- or they weren™t familiar eno
ugh to you th at you wo
uld even have known 
about it? 
A: The Franks, you mean? 
Q: Yeah. 

A: No. No, no, I don™t know. 
You know, you were all too mu
ch involved with  your own 
problems, that I-I didn™t know the family or
 anything like that. Y
ou know, you were so 
involved with -- and the very 
few people who were there, 
and who needed support, and 
who were your support, people that -- that you
 didn™t know about, or were -- that -- that 
didn™t come up in our lives, 
you know. Ou r lives were tough 
because we had -- we had to  
work  so hard  to get b
ack to -- to where we were before
. And I think about it, I have the 
greatest admiration for my father, who someho
w managed to get a factory back to work , 
and make some money. And, I me an, we had 
a house again and later on, we had -- with 
everything we needed again. 
It™s amazing how it -- it all came back. And what was very 
painful after the war was that
 some people left money an
d -- and belongings and there 
were big fights in families on who got what
, and nobody had a will, cause you didn™t 
think of things like that. So you inherited fro
m the strangest people and from your closest 
relatives, you so metimes didn™t inherit. And 
then the -- th e government took enormous 
amounts of money as taxes of those inheritan
ce. We had people wh o had valuables were -
- and who came back after the war, tried to ge
t their valuables back
 from friends, or from 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0033
 
 
26
 
 
 
a-acquaintances, and people just didn™t want to
 give it back, they sa
id, ﬁOh no, that was 
mine.ﬂ And they were so used to having those 
things that they didn™t want to give it back. 
Th-The -- The strangest situations arose, that 
made it hard to get frie
ndly with people that 
you used to be friendly with. What was it -- it
 was a stran g e, empty life, right after the 
war, and it took years to sort of come back to
 a normal life. For instance, I had gone to -- 
I™ve -- I™ve had -- finished elementary school, a
nd I -- I was supposed to
 go to some sort 
of a high school, but I did that
 for one year, but that year 
was so strange, because people 
were not showing up the next day, teachers 
weren™t showing up the next day. You know, 
there was always somebody who was taken aw
ay by the Germans, so
 the school was not 
a normal school year. And so when I went ba
ck after the war, I went for three years to 
high school, and then  I just quit, because I 
just couldn™t stand it, I was in the meantime 

this grown-up -- I had gone thro ugh so  mu ch 
that I wasn™t this 15 year old kid when  I 
came out of the war. I -- I -- I just didn™t have
 the patience to sit in class an-and study. So, 
after three years I quit and I 
went to work. And I helped 
my father i n  his business.  
Q: What was his business?  
A: He produced corsets and we -- we manufac
tured like sportswear, things like that. And 
I-I worked in the --

Beginning Tape Two, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of a United States
 Holocaust Memorial Mu
seum interview with 
Hetty DeLeeuwe. This is tape number two, side A.  
A: -- patience to sit in class an-and study. So
, after three years I quit and I went to work. 
And I helped  my  father in his busin ess. 

Q: What was his business?  

A: He produced corsets and we -- we manufac
tured like sportswear, things like that. And 
I-I worked in the office and I wo
rked in the factory, too. Th
at was better for me, I think. 
School was just not challenging 
enough at that time, I -- I didn™
t have the -- the brains to -
- to put myself to work, and my mother woul
d have loved to see me
 go to college, but -- 
was big disappointment, but I 
couldn™t help it. I was better 
off doing something with my  
hands and keeping my mind occupied that wa
y. And so I worked  for many, ma ny years, 
and for -- later on my father sold the busine
ss, cause he was sick, a nd so then I had a 
regular job. And I lived in Holland til I wa
s 31, and then I marri
ed and came to the 
United States. 

Q: How did you meet him?  

A: How I met my  husband? My  husband is orig
inally also from Holla
nd, and that family 
was very lucky, they made it just in time out
 of Holland before the war. I guess they were 
on th e boat when  the war broke out, or some
thing that close. And so my  husband, as a 
small child, was growing up in 
the United States. After the wa
r, the family went back to 
Holland, because they us
ed to have businesses there, and 
my father-in-law wanted to see 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0033
 
 
28
 
 
 
what he could salvage. So th
ey stayed in Holla
nd. Bu t having grown up in the United 
States and then coming back to Holland in a small town, being my  husband was very st -- 
rather observant, it was sort of an impossible 
task. So, he came back to the United States 
when  he was 18, and then he ended up in th
e service, during Ko rea.
 He ended up serving 
in Moro cco and wh en  he was discharged , they
 asked him to stay on, and he wo rked  in 
Weisbaden, Germany. And that way he came
 home once in awhile
. So that™s how we 
met, because they lived sort 
of around the corner. And then 
we married, and he lived in 
the United States, but we married in Ho
lland and then I came with him here.  
Q: Where did you come to? What -- What -- 

A: We started out in New York  City, and 
we lived on Long Island and th en he was 
transferred to Washington area, and we liv
ed between Washingt
on and Baltimore. And 
then we got transferred to Chica
go, and that™s where we are now. 
Q: How did you feel about coming to the Un
ited States and leaving Holland? Were y -- 
Were you happy about it? Did you want to ge
t out of there, or were -- were you sad -- 
A: No. No, no, no, no, no, no. 
I -- I felt bad that I left my parents and I never realized 
how hard it was for them that their  only child 
was leaving. I really never thought of that. 
But I was happy, I was marrying a very nice 
guy, and I had never wanted to go to  the 
United States, it never was any attraction to
 me. But I had no choice, it was either 
marrying my -- my lover and go with him to
 the United States, or not marry. And so I 
chose the Un ited States and my  husband. And 
I™m not sorry. I love it here. I don™t think I 

would s -- go back to  Europe. I love Europe, I l
ove to travel there, love the culture and I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0033
 
 
29
 
 
 
think you miss that in the Unite
d States. But -- The old build ings 
and all that sort of stuff. 
But, I don™t think I could 
settle in Holland any more. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: It™s -- It™s painful. I ha -- My parents pa
ssed away in  the meantime, too. So , I have my  
mother-in-law, my sister-in-law and her fami
ly, and that™s all very well, but it™s -- it™s 
empty for me there. A nd here I 
have good friends, and my  kids. 

Q: When  you came over, you didn™t 
have any children at that point? 
A: No, no, no, I was just married. 
Q: Yeah. Ho w many children do you 
have? When  did you have th em? 
A: I have tw o sons, I have tw
o sons and one lives, 
thank God, in Chicag
o. The other one, 
for the time being, lives in Sao Paolo, Brazil.
 So, that™s far. But we -- we have travel 
privileges at United Airlines, because my  husband 
used to be pilot. So
 we travel easy and 
he can come home once in awhile. 
It™s -- It™s far, but it™s not 
that far that it™s unreachable. 
Q: Mm-hm. What are your son™s names? How old are they? 

A: One, the youngest is David, he™s 34. A
nd Isaac, he™s 35, the 
oldest. And sadly enough, 
they™re both  single, but that™s something I can™t do anything ab out any mo re. 
Q: Any eligible -- 

A: They know I would love -- I would love th
em -- to seem -- see th
em married, but there 
comes a time that 
a mother has to keep her mouth shut. 

Q: If any eligible women are listening, do you
 want to drop th eir phone numbers onto th e 
tape at this point?

A: No, no, no, no, no. No, no,
 no, it™s their business, you 
know, I can™t mingle in any 
more. 
Q: Did you, when you came to
 the United States, did -- did 
you work , did you stay at 
home? 
A: No, I stayed home. I was 31 when I married
, I was 32 when I had my first ca -- child 
and we decided that it was better for me to 
stay home and raise the kids. And in those 
years, it might have been nice 
if we had had a little extra, but
 over the years, being an 
airline pilot, we -- we had a decent income, a
nd it wasn™t necessary fo
r me to -- to go to 

work, so I was a stay home mo
m. But I did always do some
thing, volunteer work, so -- 
and I™m still involved in  that. 
Q: What about your children 
and you, and your experiences during the war? Did you -- 
When they were younger, did 
you talk about it much with
 them? How did you handle 
that? You know, you said your -- your family
 back in Holland, basically, you didn™t talk 
about it. 
A: No, my mother didn™t talk
 about it. No, the kids know that I was hidden, and th ey 
know about th-the family that
 I was with, and they know so
me of them. And they  have 
visited, too, there. When  they were in Holla
nd, I took them along there, and they visited. 
Not too many times, but we did go there. And -- 

Q: You went where? 
A: To Holland to vis
it my step-parents. 
Q: Oh. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0033
 
 
31
 
 
 
A: They -- They knew about it, and somehow th
ey, over the years have told me that I am 
o -- too overprotective, because -- and they -- 
they blame that on th e sort of holding onto 
them, and it™s a result of the war 
that I am th e way I am. I don™t know if that™s true. They 
always say, well Jewish mo thers are always ove
rprotective. I don™t think that is true, I 
think that all mothers are protective of their 
 children if they™re nor
mal mothers. But, I™m 
always happy when  I know they™re coming, th
at they™re home and worried that -- I think 
I wor -- I worry -- I -- I worry th
at th-they got an accident, or
 that something happens to 
them, and I™m always happy wh
en they™re home and then th
ey™re safe around. But they 
know my  story and -- and th ey know how diffi
cult it was. And they missed too, the par -- 
th-the -- the family. They -- 
They  have no ex tended fami ly, 
as such. So, they -- they -- 
they know what -- what the wa
r did to them, too. It™s -- 
They  have three cousins in 
Holland, my  sister-in-law has three daughters, but
 that™s all they have. And they have this 
one uncle and th is one aunt, an
d there is nothing else, you know, that comes after that. So 
they too, feel the -- the  pain of not having
 a big family, li ke ot
her people around here.  
Q: Did they get to know th
eir grandparents very well? 
A: Well, they -- my -- my fa
ther and my father-in-law -- my father-in-law passed away 

before we were married, my fa
ther-in-law -- my father died right after we were married, 
so they never knew th eir grandfathers, but 
my  mo th er came reg u l arl y  and  my  mo th er-in -
law, too, so they know their -- they kne
w my mother very well, they had a good 
relationship with her, and th ey have a very 
good relationship with my mother-in-law. My 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0033

son from Brazil calls h er like every other week
, and -- and they -- they value that very 
much, yeah. 
Q: Your mo ther had a -- a horrible experience during the war. 

A: Yeah. 
Q: Did they talk much with her about that? 
A: No, no, she didn™t 
talk about that, no. 
Q: Did they ever ask and sh e refuse
, or what? It just didn™t come up? 
A: I n -- I don™t think th ey ev er asked and sh
e never talked about it. She never talked 
about it. The only thing [indecip
herable] that she was in Au
schwitz in October, and when 
my father had passed away, she came regularly
 here in the winter, because those long 
nights and those lonely days, especially in 
October, she didn™t want to be alone because 
apparently  she always re-lived the horro r of 
those days in Au schwitz, and -- and she liked 
to be here with us. She didn™t talk about it, 
but I know that™s why sh
e wanted to be away. 
No, she never -- she never mentioned it, she -- 
she was very close, though, with  all those 
women who were with her in the concentrati
on camps, and all of them, exe -- except one, 
I think, have passed away. But they were all 
like sister s,  like good su
pport for each other. 
They -- They understood each other, and they 
-- without talking abou
t it, they -- they 
knew wh at was going on in  their minds, I think.
 T h ey  -- T h ey  n e ed ed
 each other very 
badly. And they were very, very close bunch,
 all those years. But no, my  mo ther didn™t 
say mu ch about it and I guess the kids never th
ought of asking. Maybe 
they didn™t dare, I 
don™t know. Never came up.

Q: What about when  things happen, wh ich th
ey do occasionally, thi
ngs come up in the 
press, things come up in the media, thi
ngs come up in the movies. There™s a new 
documentary, a movie like ﬁSchindler™s Listﬂ is made, things like that happen. 

A: I™ve seen that. I basically don™t go to war 
movies, I don™t go to -- I don™t read books on 
the Holocaust. I hate real war movies, like 
shooting and things like that. My kids never 
had guns. I™m very mu ch against war, because 
I lived through it and it™
s -- it™s so scary, 
it™s so horrendous. I™ve -- I™ve se
en the last movie, ﬁLife is
 Beautiful,ﬂ which has mixed 
reactions from some people, and I know th e 
Holocaust is not to make fun of, but I 
thought the movie was very se nsitive about what happened, it 
-- I feel it™s like -- like a 
little -- not a fairy tale, what™s the right word
? A fable, you know. How it starts early in 
that life of the man and the woma n, that they -- they fall in lo
ve and they have a good life, 
good family life. They have a cute little kid,
 and already the anti-Semitism co mes in with 

the mother, and then in the war -- of course, 
in the concentration camp it wasn™t that way 
it is depicted in -- in this movie, but the love of
 the father to protect his child, is -- is -- is 
so beautiful. I think that the film
 is really very, very special.
 And I went there by mistake, 
because if I had known it was all about the 
Holocaust, I wouldn™t have gone. But I -- I 
wasn™t sorry I saw it. And I saw ﬁSchindler™s
 List.ﬂ And the -- I never saw ﬁShoah.ﬂ An d 
I don™t want to see mo vies on -- on -- on the 
Holo caust, on th -the -- the camps and things 
like that. I™ve been to
 the Holocaust Museum, few times. 
But I find that difficult. I find it 
very difficult. It™s when you 
see all those ma ss of shoes, I think, ﬁOh maybe the -- my  -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0033
 
 
34
 
 
 
my -- my uncle™s shoes are in there,ﬂ or my 
whatever. All those pictures. It™s so mething 
that will never leave us.  
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: And I know most of those people that I 
mourn all the time, wouldn™t have been here 
any mo re, you know. By this 
time, mo st of them would ha
ve been gone. My  p -- My 
grandparents for sure. But it -- it was -- you can™t 
realize that -- that all those people were 
murdered, for what? Just  because you™re Jewish? And as I say, my parents were atheists. 

They  didn™t do anything about 
being Jewish, religiously, th
at is, for sure. And -- But 
Hitler didn™t care. Hitler didn™t care. 

Q: How about you and your husb
and, are you religious at all?
 Are you like your parents, 
or -- 
A: Well, my husband came from an o-observant 
home, and I learned, in my  hiding days, 
about religion. And so, after the war, I guess 
I made up my mind that I -- I wanted to 
marry Jewish, because I 
thought -- I don™t know if it™s true, 
but that was in my mind, that 
somebody who was Jewish, could 
understand better what went thro ugh in  my  head once 
in awhile. And so that was a ha
rd thing, because mo st of the 
people in my  age group, in 
Holland, were gone. Were very few eligible me
n. So, it took me awhile to -- to find the 
right one, or the right one to find me. And so
, since his mo ther is observant, I decided th at 
it was prudent to start out with a kosher ho
me. And th en we, somehow, wh en  the kids 
grew up, we got mo re observant, and my  husba
nd is very observan
t, I am a little less 
observant. But we keep a kosher
 home, and we keep all the holid ays. And th e kids are not 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0033
 
 
35
 
 
 
that observant. We tried to teach them, and 
it™s up to them now. They
 went to parochial 
school, here in Chicago. At least they had a 
good Jewish education,
 and they  know what 
they don™t want to k
now when they know what it™s all ab
out. And we -- we tried to be an  
example. But it™s hard, it™s hard to be ve
ry religious when I know some people all 
together forgot about religion after the war, othe
rs went just to religion to  get strength in 
life. There are always so many questions that it™
s -- it™s -- it™s hard, it™s hard to believe 
that everything just was for so
me reason. I can™t de -- I can™t deal with that. I th -- I can™t 
believe that was God™s plan. Bu t who am I to know? 
Q: Do you feel like you have
 found any answer, or it™
s just one big question? 
A: No, no, I didn™t find an an
sw er. No, how can you find an 
answ er to this? I mean, it™s 
terrible when -- when -- when some person sh
oots one person fo r one reason or another, 
for hatred, for -- for jealousy,
 for whatever. And -- But -- 
But how can you murder so 
many people? I me an, it™s not just the 6,000,000 Jews, there were 6,000,000 other people 
also killed, homosexuals and Gypsies, and whatever. 
People that were not hundred 
percent the way Hitler wanted th em to look. 
When  you were born with some defect, you 
were destined to go. That™s not life, that™s
 not right. No , I haven™t found an an swer to 
that. I never will find an answer.  

Q: How often these days do you th ink you th
ink about it, does anything pop into your 
head or you have thou
ghts about it? Is it 
often, hardly ev er? 
A: Oh, no, not hardly ever. Th
ere is always a day, you know, it™s like, it™s now January, 
so on the seventh of January, 
my very best friend had her 
birthday. She was just a f-few 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0033
 
 
36
 
 
 
months older than I am. And now of course
, I write down seventh of dec -- of January, 
and I say, ﬁOh my  God, it™s Yute™s birthday,ﬂ and the mil -- 
Q: You talked about her in
 your video interv iew. 
A: Yeah, yeah. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: And there are things that just happen, y
ou know, that you think 
of somebody. No, it -- 
it -- it™s not daily, but it™s always there, in 
the back of your mind.
 But it™s a lso because 
here people have so much family, especially in Chicago. When we 
lived in Baltimore, in 
-- in -- in Columbia, Maryla
nd we lived, everybody was im
ported from somewhere. It 
was a new city and everybody was from somewh
ere. So  nobody had the whole extended 
family around th em. Here in Chicago, they  a
ll are from the south side or the west side 
and they  -- they have hundreds
 of relatives around
 them, and I™m jealous of that. People 
don™t realize how lucky they are that they 
have them, and I mean, they can fu ss about a 
relative this or a relativ e that, then I tell 
them, ﬁYou have -- Y
ou have no idea how I -- 
how -- how -- how I would love to have a co
usin that I could fight with, you know, 

because it™s better than having
 nobody around.ﬂ Bu
t, it™s with everything else, if you 
don™t know it, you don™t mi ss it, 
and people don™t realize it, 
when they have all this 
extended family, and so -- even if you bury so
mebody, even if you bury that™s a pr -- 
that™s a privilege compared to what we went
 through, cause nobody has a grave. Can™t go 
anywhere. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0033
 
 
37
 
 
 
Q: Do you think so -- think a lo
t of people take family for gr
anted, do you 
think there are 
other thin gs that people take for granted 
that you might not, because of what you 
experienced? 
A: Oh yeah, I guess always having food on th
e table, cause at the end of the war, we 
didn™t always have what we wanted. We 
went to bed and we said, ﬁMom, we are 
hungry.ﬂ Oh, when I thin
k about it, what we did to this po
or woman, to tell her that we™d 
like to have another slice of bread and she co
uldn™t give it to us, because if she gave us 
another slice of bread, we wo
uldn™t have bread in the 
morning, and everything was 
rationed, and I, for instance, didn™t always 
get a ration books. So, then I ate from their 
food, and the son to ld me so, not because he wa
nted to  be mean, but he thought that was -

- was cute, you know, to say,
 ﬁYou know, you ate my bread.ﬂ Well, then I couldn™t eat. 
So, no, I am very ra -- very mu
ch  aware of, that I never go h
ungry and that everything is 
available and th at I have a -- a good life. Oh yeah, I™m aware of that.  

Q: I™m just old enough so that
 when -- when I was very yo ung, I don™t know when this 
stopped, but it was pretty early in my  life,
 that occasionally, you know, we™d  be eating 
and I didn™t want to finish everything -- 

A: Uh-huh. 

Q: -- that I™d been given to eat, and I can 
still remo -- remember my
 mother occasionally 
saying to  me, ﬁYou know, you sh
ould finish that, there are ch
ildren starving in Europe.ﬂ 
And you know, it became like this
 cliché in a way, and I th
ink wh en my  brothers and I 
got a little older, we™d still occasiona
lly hear that, and you know -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0033
 
 
38
 
 
 
A: Now you make fun of it. 
Q: -- we™d want to be -- well, we™d want to
 be smart, so we™d say to her, ﬁWell, you 
know, so fine, so send it to th
em.ﬂ You know, ﬁI don™t want it,ﬂ or ﬁHow is me eating it 
going to  help them?ﬂ 

A: That™s true, that™s true. 
Q: But I guess she was referring to people lik
e yourself were in the circumstances you 
were in after the war, and during the war. 

A: Yeah, after the war, it was still very tight. 
But, well you realize, you know, when you -
- once when you™ve been
 hungry , it™s a different story, of course. But there™s so many 
unjust things in this wo rld. I wish I could sa
ve the world, but it -- I try my best, just a 
little bit, you know. 
Q: How so? What do you do? 
A: I volunteer for Soviet Jews
. Not the ones who are here, but the ones who are still 

there. So, try to pay a little bit back 
to the world. But it™s -- it™s tough. 
Q: I think -- I™ve done several of these inte
rviews, and one of the things that always 
comes up, one of the strongest things that people 
say, and that they refer to very often, is 
the same thing you™ve been brin
ging up here, is all those miss
ing people, and sort of this 
kind of huge hole wh ich is create
d at the center of your life. 
A: Mm-hm. 

Q: That can never comp letely be filled again. 

A: No, it won™t. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0033
 
 
39
 
 
 
Q: Every-Everybody 
talks about that. 
A: Yeah. Ca-Ca-Cause that is -- that is wh
at bothers us the most, I think, you know? 
Whatever you do, you know, 
you can make a million dollars
, you can make 10,000,0 00 
dollars, i-it -- that will never be 
able to come back 
in your life. You k
now, in my house I 
am surrounded with things from my  parents a
nd the clock is my  mother™s wedding gift 
from one of their friends. And 
you know, I -- I have peace with my  mo ther having passed 
away at the age she did. I have
 less peace with my father havi
ng died as young as he did, 
because that must have b
een a result of the war. The 
sorrow and the anguish and 
everything else, he just didn™t want to live 
any mo re. And -- And that™s also indirect, you 
know, a result of the war. So, there are things 
in my  house that remi nd me of my  parents, 
that™s fine, that doesn™t seem 
to hurt. But there are also thin
gs in my house that remind of 
people wh o have been  mu rdered. 
And that -- that -- that always
 hurts, that always hurts, 
and it remi nds me of them not being around, yo
u know. It™s something 
that will never be 
-- be fixed.  
Q: Tho -- Those type of things that you were 
just referrin g  to, are there any of them right 
nearby here, that we can see 
from where we™re sitting, or -- 
A: No, this was fro
m my  -- my  a u n t . 
Q: That is -- Tell us what
 you™re pointing to there. 
A: This is a -- This is a -- a silver tr
ay that was in my  aunt™s house, and -- 
Q: Which is filled with
 cookies right now. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0033
 
 
40
 
 
 
A: -- is filled with cookies, yeah. And it neve
r should have been in
 my house. You know, 
that™s what it is, too, because she had a 
daughter. So, if she had passed on in the 
meantime, it would have been in my  cousin™s  house and not in my  house. And th at™s -- 
that™s how it -- how all those things speak 
to you. So, you don™t 
alway think about the 
person directly, but then you 
see something in  your house and you say, ﬁOh yeah, this 

was from this [indecipherable]. Or when I 
say -- when  I say a da
te you write down, you 
just -- you th ink of somebody™s bi
rthday or whatever sp ecial da
y. It™s -- It™s a big hole 
that can never be fixed, can™t me nd it.  
Q: There are some people, I would imagine,
 who would -- feeling 
that way, who would 
take those reminders out of their life, who 
would not have things, you know, like this 
silver tray, or like the clock 
around. Maybe they wouldn™t ge
t rid of them totally, but 
they, you know
, you know -- 
A: Put them away. 
Q: I mean often -- I mean, people have differe
nt responses to experiences, and sometime s 
when  people go through very  painful things, thei
r way of coping with 
it is to take away 
the reminders, to kind of put a barrier ar
ound and make a space where those thoughts 
come up less. There™s -- There™s -- There are le
ss physical things even around to prompt 

any thoughts like that.  
A: Well, we did that in the beginning. 
Q: You did? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0033
 
 
41
 
 
 
A: After the war. I guess we -- we just sort 
of had blinders, and 
just tried to do our 
everyday chores and tried to make life bearab
le again. But I don™t think it -- it -- it serves 
a purpose to -- to bend those thoughts out of 
your life, cause they -- there was -- they 
were all people, they  were all bright mi
nds and -- and -- and wonderful persons. And I 
think it™s good to remember them, and to remi
nd yourself that they 
were around one day. 
It would -- i -- i -- I think it -- it -- it™s good 
to remind them, in your mind, of things -- 
End of Tape Two, Side A 
Beginning Tape Two, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of a United States
 Holocaust Memorial Mu
seum interview with 
Hetty DeLeeuwe. This is tape number two, side B.  
A: -- bend those thoughts out of your life, ca
use they -- there was -- 
they were all people, 
they were all bright minds and -- and -- and 
wonderful persons. And 
I think it™s good to 
reme mb er them, and to remind yourself that they
 were around one day. It would -- i -- i -- 
I think it -- it -- it™s good to  remind them, in your
 mind, of things that were also good in  
our lives, before the war. We think about the 
good old days. They  were not everybody™s 
happiest days, but they, you know, they were 
part of our life, so I think it™s good to 
remind yourself that they were one day ar
ound and sadly enough, no mo re. I don™t want 
to push it away. 
Q: When you first came to the U.S. -- well, 
first of all, I don™t know if we™ve ever 
actually said your husband™s name. 
A: Abraham DeLeeuwe. Al, we call him.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0033
 
 
42
 
 
 
Q: When you came over here at first, wa
s it hard to adjust
 to this country? 
A: Oh, awful. I didn™t know anybody. I spoke
 a little English, but 
not American English, 
and I was different. It -- It -- It™s a altogether
 different life. So I gu
ess I was luc ky that we 
had ch ildren right away, and -- and that bringsyou in contact with your surroundings, and 
then somehow you make frie
nds, and you get acquaintances
, and when my  kids were 
little, I met somebody in the sy
nagogue, who said, ﬁOh, yo
u can™t stay home all day 
long,ﬂ So  she dragged me to -- to one of the 
meetings of -- one of organizations and that™s 
how I started, you know, getti
ng part of the community. But 
it™s hard to, especially in 
New Yo rk, to get started if you don™t know 
anybody. Here, it was different, here in the 
Midwest, people are warmer, and so they -- 
they come to you, and welcome you. It™s 
different, altogether different approach
 here. But in New 
York it was hard. 
Q: Did you live actua
lly in the city? 
A: I lived in Queens, yeah, in
 the beginning, and then  late
r on we lived on Long Island. 
And that™s still New York. 

Q: Little different than 
Amsterdam, though, huh? 
A: A lot different, yeah, a lot dif -- well, 
I didn™t live -- after the war we didn™t live in 
Amsterdam any more, we lived like in the su
burbs. And that was better, that was better, 
cause you didn™t want to walk those street
s every day, where you had so many sad remi-
reminders. It was a good th ing that
 we moved away . . . yeah.  
Q: What were you th inking about just now? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0033
 
 
43
 
 
 
A: How th -- How hard it is. It™s 
-- It™s -- It™s difficult someti
mes to talk about it, too, you 
know, and it™s hard to express yourself. 
Q: Doing fine. 

A: Yeah, well, that™s w h at they always te
ll me, but it doesn™t always come easy, you 
know. I never say no if they ask me, because I 
feel that I owe it to wh
atever, to talk about 

it. I -- Normally, I don™t talk ab
out it, it -- you know, 
it™s something that is inside me. And 
my  husband was here during th e war, so he -- he 
also lost a lot of relatives, but he didn™t 
feel that -- the -- the anguish , you know, a
nd th e -- the Germans came to the house, and 
rang the bell, or they picked 
you up, or things like that, th
e -- the -- you know, always the 
nervousness that was around your life. So he di
dn™t grow up, thank God, that way. But he 
suffered enough from the war, of course.  
Q: When you think back on the time where th
at family had taken you in , and -- before 
liberation, or wh atever, you did a video in
terview for the museum, now we™ve -- we™ve 
talked for awhile. Is there any little story, 
or anecdote, or memory you have from that 
time, that you haven™t mentioned,
 that -- I mean, it could be an
ything, or just a little thing 
that sometimes you remember th at happened, or
 a conversation or some little incident, or 
-- 
A: Not really. You know, it w -- it w -- it was 
-- it was very serious 
household. They ™re 
very orthodox Christians, I guess 
that™s why they took me in
, cause my step
mother told 
me, when I asked her why did you do this, she 
said, ﬁWell, when they
 came to ask me, I 
figured God sent those people 
to me, and I have no choice.ﬂ That was -- There was never

anything fun, you know, that happened . 
Wa -- Ev-Everything 
was serious, it was a 
serious time, we -- we -- nearly every night, 
even before the start 
of the liberation,we 
ended up in bomb sh elters, because we we
re bombed. So, you know, it -- it w asn™t a 
pleasant life there either. It --
 My father was up north, and 
nothing happened  th ere, you 
know, he had all good food, and he was with 
sweet people, and he wa
lked outside all the 
time. And, of course, he wasn™t in his own 
surroundings, but he -- he didn™t live under 
that pressure, like we had every day, that 
they bombed the surroundings, and once he was 
in jail, he -- he wasn™t so happy either, 
I™m su re. But [indecipherable] really nothing 
extraordinary that I can thin
k of, I mean, when I was ther
e, it was most difficult.  
Q: You say nothing fun happened, it was very
 serious, was that because, you know, it 
was a serio u s and difficult time, o r were th
ese people also just very serious and -- 
A: No, I -- I don™t think that that™s the case, 
cause I reme mb er not too long ago, couple of 
years ago, when we were visiting, that we
 were having dinner and we had a bottle of 
wine on the table, and my  st epmo ther said, ﬁWell, you see me, we can have a pleasant 

dinners, too.ﬂ Everything was just tight in 
those days. I don™t know
 how mu ch money th e 
man made, but they  had to feed another m
outh. I mean, there was -- they all had to 
sacrifice for me. And, you know, there 
was just always nerve wracking -- the 
circumstan ces were just that way, they w -- a
nd th ey were serious people, but the war just 

made it that way, I think. And maybe me being 
there, too, you know. I -- I was a threat to 
their family  life, there™s no question about it. 
And they were s -- th ey
 were involved in 
underground wo rk th emselves, too. I never kn
ew that then, during the war, I found that

out after the war, cause what you didn™t 
know, you couldn™t talk about. The least you 
know, the better it was. But, 
no, it was just a very serious time. You know, you couldn™t 
go out, there was no radio, you couldn™t
 -- th-there -- there was -- people don™t 
understand it, how --how you gr
ew up in those years, without
 having any fun, you know? 
And then, after the war, I was so serious and ol
d, comp ared to 15 year old kids, because I 
had -- it -- it -- it takes it™s to -- it t-took 
it™s toll, you know, being aw ay from my  parents 
and it™s tension. And -- And the years before
 I was in hiding, you know, cause we -- we 
lived through all these -- these crazy times
 at home, but it was nerve wracking. I 
remember when my -- my
 youngest aunt was picked up w
ith her husband, 
my  mo th er ju st 
went to bed. She couldn™t deal with it. And 
the life was awful, life wa
s just awf u l. Yeah.  
Q: But you™ve had a 
decent 50 years since. 
A: Oh yeah. Oh -- Oh 
yeah, oh yeah. I -- I 
-- I™m not comp laining, you know. Sometimes 
I think, ﬁWell, what was the purpose that I 
-- I did survive?ﬂ You 
know, why me? That -- 
That comes up many times in your mind. But 
I have a good life, I™m -- I mean I -- I -- I 
won™t say I™m -- I™m every day in tears, far fr
om. No, I have a good life, and I enjoy my -
- my  fami ly and my  husband, and even retiremen
t isn™t so bad. You know, we travel a lot, 
and we enjoy th at, and we have -- we have 
fun with our kids. No body™s life is perfect.  
Q: No.  
A: But -- And I think th ere are lots of people 
who have tragedies in their life, so  I™m not 
the only one who had it difficult,
 you know? But this tragedy 
was so different from every

other, normal tragedy i-in life. Can get sick 
and die young, it™s sad, 
but the whole thing is 
just unreal, but it happened, that™s for sure
. It™s not something we -- we imagine.  
Q: That™s about it for my questions, is there 
anything that you want to say a little more 
about, or that didn™t come up, that you want 
to talk about before 
we end the interview? 
A: I™ve no idea, I don™t know. 
I don™t know. I don™t think so. 
Q: Well, listen, thanks for taking the time. 

A: Thank you, thank you. 

Q: And -- And talking with us, 
and it™s very nice and warm 
and comfortable in here, and 
there™s what, seven or eight feet of snow? 

A: No, no, no. 

Q: That™s piled up outside
 there in the last -- 
A: Yeah -- th -- th -- 

Q: -- year? I mean, in the last week. I mean, I™
ve never seen -- I lived here for years and I 
never saw snow like you have now. 
A: No, but you -- no, no, but we haven™t had 
it for -- the last one was about 11 - 12 years 
ago, maybe. I don™t know ex actly. ™70, we ca
me here ™76, in ™77 - ™78, it was awful. 
That™s 20 years ago. I don™t know what -- ho
w long ago it is that we have that. For the 
last couple of years, I can™t reme mber ha
ving shoveled snow, 
but this is awful. 
Q: Now there are mountains of it out there. 
A: Yeah. And th en the hard pa
rt is to get out of drivew ay s and to  -- to see your way out 

of those -- those mountains. You 
don™t know if somebody™s coming, yes or no. It™s tough.

Oh, I live for that, too. You learn, you learn. 
I -- When I first lived here, I couldn™t drive 
in snow. In my life, I h adn™t 
done that. But you have no choice here. If you don™t want to 
drive in the snow, you -- you™re
 stuck here, sometimes for m
onths. So, we deal with it, 
drive careful. 
Q: Okay, well thanks again. 
A: Thank you. 

Q: Okay. This concludes the United States
