February 28, 2014
 
 
Question: All right. Today is Friday, 28th Febr
uary 2014. I'm Steven
 Myes at the United 
States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Wash
ington DC interviewing Frank Towers, who 
is in Florida. We are interviewing him by
 telephone. Mr. Towers, can you tell me when 
you were born and where? a
 
Answer: Yeah. I was born in Boston,
 Massachusetts, June 13, 1917. 
 
Q: Did you grow up in Boston? 
 
A: Well, I grew up there until I was 10 years old. 
 
Q: Okay . 
 
A: And at that time my father's business move
d to Vermont, and of co
urse I finished my 
education there in St. Johnsbury, Vermont, 
and th en in 1940, I graduated from high 
school in 1935 and went to 
the University of Florida--I 'm
 sorry--Vermont. And in 1940 I 
got into the military servic
e and stayed for ten years.
 
Q: Okay. Let's back up a wee bit. What sort of business was your father in?  
 
A: He was a machinist, and his compa
ny moved to Vermont for, I guess, for tax 
purposes. 
 
Q: I see. And did you en
joy it there in Vermont? 
 
A: Yeah. Growing up th ere, I enjoye
d it better than I did in Boston. 
 
Q: I see. W h at was the name of 
the high school that you went to? 
 
A: It was St. Johnsbury Academy. 
 
 
Q: Okay . Was that an all
boys school or was it coed? 
 
A: It was coed. It was sort of a semipriv
ate school. It was a school founded by the 
Fairbanks Family. It was the only high school 
in town, and ev ery student in town was 
entitled to go to that school
 and get a good education. 
 
Q: And did you enjoy it there? 
 Did you participate in a
ny sort of extracurricular 
activities?  
 

A: No. This was during the Depression years in
 the 30s 35, and I had 
to work to actually 
pay my  way, buy my  books, a
nd pay my  way thro ugh high schoo
l. So I didn't have mu ch  
time to be involved in
 the outside activities.
 
Q: And how did you do th at? 
 How--what sort of work did you do while in school? 
 
A: Well, I was a stock boy in a store for 
awhile, and worked for a company Standard 
Brands as a stock clerk there, and that's 
about all that I did in the way of wo rk . 
 
Q: Right. And did you ha
ve any friends there?  Did you m
eet your wife in high school for 
instance? 
 
A: No. I had a lot of friends that--when I 
left Vermont in 1940, I came down here to 
Florida, to Camp  Blanding, Florida. And sp en
t--been a year training 
here, and during th at 
time I met this young lady that, eventually, 
three years later, we married and we have 
been hanging around togeth er ever since. 
 
Q: I see. And what made you 
decide to go to th
e Univ ersity of Vermont?  Had you set 
your sights on th at from the go--
 
A: Well, I was in the business administratio n. 
 
Q: Okay . 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: You graduated in  1940? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Did--tell us about your decision to go 
into the military. Were you drafted, or did 
you volunteer?  
 
A: I volunteered at that time. I was out of 
work, looking for a job,
 and employers were 
very hesitant about hiring you
ng men who had not had their m
ilitary service, but the draft 
system had just kicked in a short time before
 that, and they  did not want to train new 
employees for two, three, six months 
and then lose them to the military. 
 
Q: Right. 
 
A: So they declined employi
ng young men who had not had th
eir military training; so I 
decided to  get my  year's  training over with an
d come back  and then  be able to get a job. 
 
Q: And exactly what were the 
circumstances of that?  And wh
ere I'm going with this is 
did you seek a commission or
 did you enlist, and how 
did you come about your 
co mmiss io n ?  
 
A: To  g et my  co mmis sio n ?  
 

Q: Yes. 
 
A: Okay. I got into the local
 Company K of the National Gu
ard in  Bu rlington, and we 
came down here to Camp Blandi
ng and trained here for a year. And we're gettin g ready 
to go home back to Vermont
, and the Japanese dropped 
the bomb at Pearl Harbor 
already; so we're in (?full duration? 05:29) 
and there's no going back to Vermont at that 
time. So the unit that I was w
ith, the 43rd Division, was then
 prioritized to go to the 
Pacific and start fighting the war down there. An
d at that time, I was c
hosen to go to Fort 
Benning to go to  an offshore 
candidate school, and I spent three months there training 
and became a second lieuten
ant my commission th ere. 
 
Q: What rank had you atta
ined in enlisted ranks? 
 
A: A second lieutenant. 
 
Q: Yes. Just before became a second lieuten an
t, what rank has you attained in the rank? 
 
A: I had risen up thro ugh co rporal and serg
eant. I was a sergeant wh
en I went to Fort 
Benning. 
 
Q: You said you went in 19
40. Wh at--were you conscious of the fact of what was going 
on in  Europe, and did you see a likelihood 
of the United States entering the war? 
 
A: No. At that time, I did not. I could see th
e clouds of war in Europe, but it was still far 
away and really didn't see the United States 
getting involved in th e wa
r at that time. It 
was not until later on '42'43 that I began to see 
that they we're going 
to get involved in 
this thing. 
 
Q: And tell us about your experien ce in o
fficer candidate school. What was that like?  
 
A: Well, it was rather difficult because I had 
been working with the--a supply officer in 
the 43rd Division, and I did not get the full 
extent of the basic training of the ____ 
[(07:32)] that all the rest of the guys got. 
And so when I went to Benning, I was at a 
disadvantage because I had not had the basic 
training. And I was co
mpeting with other 
sergeants who had had the basic 
training; so I really had to do my military basic training 
at Fort Benning during the officer candidate course. 
 
Q: And how did you fair there? 
 How did you do in the end? 
 
A: In the end, I did well. And mo re than likely I got my  commission. 
 
Q: Very good. 
 
A: If I hadn't got my  commi ssion, I'd have gone back in rank to  my  original unit. 
 
Q: So you said, you know, wh en
 the Japanese did attack Pe
arl Harbor, that's when you 
realized--America--that we were in it? 
 

A: That's correct. 
 
Q: Tell us your outages about that. What was 
that experience like? 
 When did you hear 
about the attack on Pearl Harbor?  How did 
it effect you?  What was your feelings?  
 
A: Well, I felt that this was 
going to  get us into  the war because the Japanese had bomb ed 
Pearl Harbor, but the Japanese were tied in 
with the Germans as the Axis powers and 
that, in turn, was going to
 draw us into the war. 
 
Q: I see. 
 
A: And, you know, I felt confident at that time
 that, hey, we'r e going to  go over to Euro pe 
or to the Pacific and fight these guys, and we
'r e going to get this thing over with maybe 
two or three months. That was a little optimistic. 
 
Q: Indeed . So when  were you--when was th
e decision a made to send you to  Europe? 
 
A: I'm sorry. Give me that again. 
 
Q: When  did you go to Europe?  
 
A: Okay. When I left Fort 
Benning, I went to Camp  Wh eeler, Georgia, and remained 
there as a training in structor for 14 months. 
At that time we had in vaded No rth Africa; so 
we became involved in 
the European scene at that time. 
At the end of that 14 months, I 
got transferred then into 
the 30th Infantry Division 
which was at Camp Forrest, 
Tennessee finishing up their summer maneuvers 
there, and they went to Camp Atterbury 
in Indiana. And I joined th
em there the first o f Novemb
er of '43. And they were 
prioritized to go to Europe, 
but we didn't know that at the mo ment. We didn't know 
where we were going to go, but we were do
ing our immunizations, and the final firing 
and familiarization with weapons and ge
tting prepared for 
combat somewhere.
 
And we left Camp Atterbury the first of Febr
uary of '44, and not 
knowing where we were 
going, we got on the train, and we ended up
 at Boston. And it was 
only then that we 
realized that we would be go
ing to the European theater. 
 
Q: And how were you sent there?  Did you
 go by--I assume you were shipped out by 
ship? 
 
A: Yeah. We shipped out from Bo
ston on th e 12th of February
 on the SS Argentina, and 
we joined a convoy just outsi
de of Boston. There was a lot 
of ships that came from New 
York  and Newport News, Virginia. And it was 
the largest convoy th
at ever crossed the 
ocean together. And we went to--our ship la
nded in Glasgow, Sc
otland, and from there 
we entrained down  thro ugh London and to  th
e south coast of Engl
and to a town of 
Bognor Regis. And that's where we stayed
 for the next six months training for the 
invasion if and when  it came. 
 

Q: Okay. How was your crossing? 
 Did you have a good crossing? 
 
A: It was a relatively good crossing. We di
dn't encounter any en emy ships. We had all 
kinds of battleships with us, and periodically 
we could see them darting out on so me sort 
of a mission. We just assumed they were 
out chasing a sub so me
where, but we had no 
problem in going across. The weather was fairly
 good but in the No
rth Atlantic in the 
winter it's  never very good, but we didn't en
counter any storms or 
anything; so we had a 
fair crossin g . 
 
Q: Was that your first time out of United States? 
 
A: Yes. I had been to  Canada if you call th
at out of the United Nations, but first time 
overseas, yes. 
 
Q: What did you--you were in Britain fo
r how many months again?  I'm sorry. 
 
A: Until June, about five months. 
 
Q: Did you interact with the British? 
 
A: I'm sorry?  
 
Q: Did you interact with the British? 
 
A: We did somewhat, but not 
a great deal with the--I thi
nk you're p robabl
y referring to 
the British Military, but the British civilia
ns, we had more contact with them. 
 
Q: What did you think?  What did you 
think of them?  How did they treat you? 
 
A: They treated us very well. They were 
very happy to  see us 
come andhelp them 
because they had been in the wa
r for four years already. Germ
an bombing and that sort of 
thing. 
 
Q: Sure. 
 
A: So that were very happy to 
see us come and help them out. 
 
Q: Okay . 
 
A: But we had a very good rela
tionship with the British civilians. 
 
Q: Very good. And I just want
 to back up a little bit so we
 don't get too far ahead of 
ourselves. By this time--I'm re
ferring to you being 
in Britain before being deployed to the 
continen t to comb at that is--were 
you--by this time you were married? 
 
A: No--yes, I was. I married in March of '43. 
 
Q: And you had met you wife at university? 
 

A: No, here at Camp Blanding. She was teac
hing at Jacksonville at that time, an d I met 
her there in Jacksonville. 
 
Q: Tell us about how you met. 
 
A: How we met?  
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: That's kind of a long stor
y. The people in Jacksonville 
were very hospitable and we, 
being Yankee boys at Camp  Blanding away  fro
m home, they thought it would be nice to 
invite the soldier boys fro
m Camp  Blanding to  their 
various church and civic 
organizations where they put on dances and 
get togetherers with the young people of the 
local area, Jacksonville, and of course we we
re macho guys, and we wanted to have our 
beer on Saturday  night. And wh en we'd  go to
 those dances or wh
atever function they 
were having, all they had was soft drin
ks, and we didn't  tend to go for that. 
 
So we declined a lot 
of these invitations and it got to
 the point wh ere nobody was going 
on a voluntary basis; so the army
 decided we can't disappoint
 these people. You're going 
to have to  go wh ether you like it or not. 
 
Q: Right. 
 
A: They volunteered. You, you
, you, you, you get Class A 
uniform on, and you go. So  I 
was one of those that got tiered to go, and I 
went to this dance one evening and met my  
wife and we were attracted to each other; 
so we started up a letter communication. There 
was no email back in those days; so the only 
way we could get together was to write, and 
so we just work ed up a nice relationship. 
 
Q: And you recall the first time you saw he
r, the first time you laid eyes on her? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: And what was that like? 
 
A: I'm sorry. I didn't  get that question. 
 
Q: What did you think wh
en you first saw her? 
 
A: Well, I just thought she was 
nice looking girl that I'd be interested coming back to see 
her again. 
 
Q: Sure. 
 
A: So we started writing back and forth, and 
we'd  go back to Jackso
nville and visit with 
her and met her family, and that was when 
I--I left Camp  Blanding 
and went to Fort 
Benning and went to Camp Wheeler and sort of picked up the writing communication 

again with her. And I decided 
it was time that we got more serious. We did, and in--I 
think it was January 1st of '42,
 I invited her to come up to Camp  Wheeler, and I give her 
an engagement ring, and in th e following
 March we were married there at Camp 
Wheeler. 
 
Q: That was a lovely way to start the new year. 
 
A: Yeah. In a way. 
 
Q: Indeed . So let's go back to
 Britain then. You're in th
e South of England. You're 
writing to your wife at
 that time as well? 
 
A: Oh yes. 
 
Q: What was it like being away  from her? 
 
A: Well, of course I missed her, but we were so
 busy working, training, that I didn't have 
much time to dwell on the f
act that I'm away from home 
and I'm lonesome. I w as--of 
course I missed her, but we just had so many 
activities g o ing on that we didn't have time 
to get homesick. 
 
Q: Sure. Had you had child
ren by that time or not? 
 
A: I'm sorry?  
 
Q: Did you have any ch ildren at that time? 
 
A: No. No we did not. 
 
Q: So when did--when was it made clear to 
you th at you were going to be sent into 
comb at that you were going into  contin ent, and wh ere did you go?  
 
A: Well, we were on th e south coast of Engla
nd, and we could hear the planes of the Air 
Force going over every night. Bomb ing somewh
ere over on the continent and, of course, 
everything was top secret until th
e--well, actually it was the 5th of June. At the night of 
the 5th of June, we heard this 
tremendous roar of planes goi
ng, and that just continued on 
and on and on. And we'r
e not hearing any planes coming 
back; so they were making a 
wide circle, bombing and th en coming back. 
And it was continuing on all night, and this 
was unusual because normally 
they would--the planes woul
d go out and we'd  hear them 
coming back, and that was it. 
 
Q: Right. 
 
A: So we knew that that was 
probably the beginning of th e 
invasion, and of co urse then 
the next day, we read in the newspapers that 
the invasion had started and right at that time 
we were moved to the marshalling area ne
ar South Hampton in preparation for the 
crossing. 
 

Now on D Day, the 1st and the 29th Division
 were the assault troops to go acro ss the 
channel and land on Omaha Beach and our 30th 
Division went in behind the 29th five 
days later. 
 
Q: So you entered the Euro
pean theater, combat theat
er, at D Day plus five? 
 
A: Yeah. That's right, yeah. 
 
Q: What was your position at
 the time of deployment? 
 
A: I was the platoon leader in the heav
y weap on comp any, border platoon leader. 
 
Q: What was your first experience of comb at, sir?  
 
A: I'm sorry?  
 
Q: What was your first experience of comb at?  
 
A: Well, it was different than what we expect
ed. When we were in England, we were all 
gung ho to go th ere and tear those guys up 
and make short of the situation, drive the 
Germans back and into their 
own country. Bu t we had done some training with live 
ammunition, but it was all very closely guarde
d so that we would not have any casualties 
or accidents. Once we got over to Europe, th
ere was no safety regul
ations, and bullets 
were flying around fast and furious, and we
 never knew when  the silver bullet was going 
to hit it us. It was an entirely different situation. 
 
Q: Do you remember the first ti
me, the very, very first time that eith er you received fire 
or you returned fire?  
 
A: Yeah. It was on th e 15th of June. 
 
Q: Okay . Where were you?  Tell me about it. 
 
A: We landed on Omaha Beach, and I can 
recall it very well because this was on my 
birthday, the 13th of June. I'm 
just talking with my wife he
re. We landed on my birthday 
on th e 13th of June and moved into wh at we
 call a bivouac area because this area had 
been cleared out by the 29th Division about two 
to three miles inland an
d so we stayed in 
the bivouac area over night, and the next daywe marched into this little village of 

Montmarte Grenyas which the 
29th Division th e day before 
had taken but were driven  
back out of it. And so it was our job to th
en get back in
to this town, clear it out, and 
continue on from there. And that was our first 
day of comb at, and we 
were green. We just 
didn't  realize the seriousness of what this w
hole thing was all about until the silver bullet 
hit some of our friends, and they encountere
d mines. They were hit by artillery shrapnel. 

And this was--these guys were being hit, be
came casualties, and the medics had to take 
care of them the best they could, and then  th
e next--through the night and th e next day we 
had to get replacements in for those me
n that were casualties of that day. 
 

Q: As a platoon leader, how did th
at effect you were you--tell me 
 
A: I was responsible for 50 men in my platoon,
 and ev erything I did, I had to  consider the 
safety of those men to do the actions that we
 did in firing our mortars, locating positions 
that were best suited for us, and to 
have protection as best we could. 
 
Q: And did you lose 
any men on that day or
 on subsequent days? 
 
A: That first day, no. I didn't  lose any men,
 but in subsequent following men, I did lose 
so me men .  
 
Q: That mu st have been  
extraordinarily difficult. 
 
A: It was because they were men that I had 
trained with some back
 in the states, and 
some in through my  period in England, and du
ring this period of time, you become close 
to your men and almo st like fami ly. And, 
you know, it hurts wh en you see a man get 
wounded or killed, and you feel a partially re
sponsible for it--although it's not your fault--
you feel that you lost one of your boys, and it hurt. 
 
Q: You described just now as rather like bei
ng a family. As a platoon leader, did you look 
at the men under your command, 
were they more like sons to
 you or mo re like brothers?
 
A: more like sons because, as 
I mentioned, when I landed ther
e, I was 27 years old on my 
birthday, and mo st of my  men were 18,
 19, 20 years old, what I call kids. 
 
Q: Right. 
 
A: So there was a little bit of 
a gap there, and I felt more or 
less they were my sons that I 
had to take care of them. 
 
Q: Sure. What did you think o
f--you said before going into 
comb at you had that attitude 
that. You were going to go 
in and show these guys the wh at for. Once you had that 
experience of close combat, wh
at did you think ab out the Germans?  Were they good 
soldiers? 
 
A: We found that--we really learned that they
 were well trained, well disciplined soldiers, 

and they  had weapons that were as good as or
 better than wh at we had. And the only way 

we gained  the upper hand was the fact that
 we just had mo re men. We had mo re 
weapons, mo re tanks and we just overp ower
ed them by sheer numbers rather than 
technical better weapons. They ha
d better weapons than we had. 
 
Q: Sure. But let's talk about 
that a little more. How 
did you view them, 
the Germans, that 
is to say the German soldie
rs. How did you view them?  
 
A: Well, they were good. The most of them
, the Wehrmachts, were very good soldiers, 
well disciplined. One of the big di
fferences that we found is that
 they went strictly by the 

book. Whatever was in the training manuals, what
ever their leaders told
 them to do, that's  
what they  did, nothing mo re. 
 
Q: Okay . 
 
A: But with the American
 soldiers, we adapted. We were 
told what to do and how to do 
it, but if that didn't work, then we had the 
liberty of doing someth
ing else that would 
work, and we had that flexibility 
which the German
s did not have. 
 
Q: Okay. Now, as you're moving inland, movi
ng deeper and deeper in
to France, at some 
point you came into contact with Jews. Can 
you tell us about that first experience with 
Jews? 
 
A: Jews?  
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: Okay. We did not have any 
contact with Jews. Now, let 
me go back a little bit. Back 
in the early training days. Occasionally, we w
ould hear or read in the newspapers about 
some Jews being tortured in 
Europe, slave lab o rers, and this
 periodically would appear, 
but we never pay mu ch  attenti
on to it because what we were
 hearing was that some Jew 
would escape from some camp--w
e didn't k n ow about Auschw
itz and Dachau  back  in 
those days. We heard there were these camp
s where they were concentrating Jews and 
torturing them and using th em as slave labor, 
but the story that we would get was that a 
Jew escaped from a camp, went back to his 
hometown, and told th
e people about what 
was going on in  this camp--that the Jews were
 being tortured and used as slave labor. 
They  wouldn't--they did not believe him. Th
e Jewish congreg ation 
in his town  did not 
believe him because, like us, we thought of 
the German people as being civilized human 
beings, inelegant people, and they  would not 
do th at to another segment of human beings. 
 
So this went on, periodically, we would read 
articles like this while we were in England, 

but when  we got into  France, we saw none of
 that. In fact, Jews didn't even cross our 
mind. That was not why we were there. We we
ren 't there to liberate to Jews. We didn't 
know about that whole situation. We were 
there to drive the Germans out of the land 
which they had occupi
ed illegally. So we were not conc
erned with Jews, and we never 
really saw any Jews because the Germans ha
d taken them all out of France back to 
Germany to use them as slave lab o rers. So
 as we proceeded through No rmandy and 

Northern France and in to Belg ium, we did ne
ver saw or had any contact with any Jews. 
 
Q: Okay . 
 
A: They were all gone. 
 
Q: Right. 
 

A: So we continued on thro
ugh Belgium and into Holland 
in the Battle of the Bulge 
during th e winter of '4 4 '45, and then we capt
ured the City of Aachen, which was the first 
city to fall in Germany. And 
up to that time, we had seen
 nor heard nothing about any 
Jews. Now, we contin ued up onto north wa
rd  through Monchenglad bach and Hameln, 
Detmold, and we crossed the Rh ine River on the 
24th of March. Now, up to that time, we 
had seen nor heard noth ing about Jews. That
 was not in our  anything th at we cared 
about. 
 
Q: Sure. As you're fighting along and as 
you'r e moving through 
Belgium and in the 
Netherlands and Germany, wh at have you, is the German resistance getting stiffer or can-
-do you sense has being an officer that it 
 
A: Oh it was getting much less. From the time
--we had our last major battle in France at 
the City of Mortain, and that 
was the beginning of wh at we 
called the rat race, that they 
were moving back to  Germany almo
st as fast as they could. 
 
Q: So as an officer, you could sense them in retreat? 
 
A: I'm sorry?  
 
Q: You could sense them in retreat?  
 
A: Well, yes. Yeah. 
 
Q: So you crossed the Rhin e. Let's go to that
 period of time, and you're pressing on. 
 
A: Right. So we were just chasing them. Th
ey were doing what we call--I forgot what it 
is now--sort of defensive action as they were 
retreating, and the major part of the German 
army was moving back eastward toward Germ
any, and they would leave a small segment 
of men behind to delay us, to create delaying
 actions. And that's al
l we did all the way 
across northern France and up
 into Belgium and Holland 
and not until we got into 
Holland and the German border
 where they had the Siegfried
 Line. That's where we had 
to stop and of course they stopped as well, but the reason th
at we stopped there was that 
we had run across France and Belgium and Ho
lland so fast, we had outrun our supply 
lines. Now, all of our supplies had to come
 across England, across the channel in to 
Omaha Beach, and by truck, move them up da
ily to supply us wi
th food, ammunition, 
clothing, replacements. So it was kind of a slow
 process, and we were moving faster than 
the supply lines could keep 
up with us. So by the time 
we got to Holland and th e 
Siegfried Line, we had left t
housands of vehicles 
behind because we ran out of gasoline. 
We just dropped the vehicles off at the side 
of the road and abandoned
 them more or less. 
So by the time we got to Holland, we were ou
t of food, we were out of ammunition, we 
were out of gasoline. So we had to stop ther
e nearly a month waiting 
for supplies to reach 
us and become resupplied with
 ammunition, with food, repl
acement men before we could 

make a successful attack on th
e Siegfried Line, and once we got the mo mentum going, to 
keep on going. 
 
Q: When  did that happen?  
 
A: That was in about February of '44 or '
45. I'm sorry. February  
'45 that we crashed 
through the Siegfried Line and we had enou
gh mo mentum going th at we just kept on 
going, and got up to  Monche
ngladbach and Wessel and acr
oss the Rhin e River, which 
was the biggest major obstacle that we had 
at that time. So we continued on from 
crossing the Rhine River 24th of March and 
headed to Brunswick,
 which is in the 
north ern part of Germany. Now, up to this
 time, we had not seen nor heard anything 
about Jews or concentr
ation camps. Nothing. 
 
Q: Now, this should have been around Ap ril, was it not?  
 
A: This was the 10th of April that we
 captured  Brunswick . No w, there was a 
concen tration camp BergenBelsen  wh ich was a 
little bit north  of Brunswick, because that 
was in the British zone. So we had nothing to
 do with it, but it was there nevertheless. 
But we didn't even hear about it. We capt
ured  Brunswick , and then
 our next objective 
was Magdeburg. It was probabl
y 75 or 100 miles further ea
st, and we started moving 
from Brunswick on toward Magd
eburg, and we came to this
 town of Hillersleb en where 
there was a large German air base. We captu
red that, and th en there was a number of 
large barracks and a hospital, and we thought not
hing of it. We just captured that town 
and went onto the next town 
of Farsleben. As we were a
pproaching this little village of 
Farsleben--this village is proba
bly a thousand people at the 
most. We met so
me soldiers 
who were walking along th e side of the ro
ad westward, and they
 said that up in 
Farsleben, the Germans are preparing an a ttack, an ambush, for you. And they are 

protecting a trainload of peopl
e. We didn't understand ex
actly what they meant by "a 
trainload of people."  So  we had our re
connaissance unit, which was a few tanks and 
infantry men on the tanks to 
move forward to  this town  of Farsleben. They  found no 
resistance in the town. 
They cleared it out, and on the east
 side of the town, there was a 
little hill, and the tanks were 
still moving forward, and as
 they mounted the hill, and 
looked down into
 the little valley on the other side, th
ey saw a train sitting there with a 
bunch of people milling around doing whatever they
 wanted to do really. 
 
Q: Okay . This should ha
ve been--just to clarify where we 
are in time, that should of been 
probably  the 12th or 13th of Ap
ril. Somewhere around there?  
 
A: This was the 13th of April.
 
Q: Okay . 
 
A: That was when we liberated Brunswick
 on the 10th, and I 
think we liberated 
Hillersleben on the 11th or 12th
, and this was the next day, 
the 13th of April, 1945. We 

saw this train, and not knowing exactly what it was, very cautiously we approach ed it. 
They  in turn --they saw the tanks and recogni
zed them as American
 tanks. And th ey came 
rushing forw ard to meet and greet us. Then
, we found--through a few of these people 
who could speak a little bit of English, and 
one of our guys was 
a Jew, and he could 
speak a little bit of Hebrew. Well, they bega n to communicate, and what they found was 

this train had about 2,
500 people on it. And it had co me
 from BergenBelsen. Well, what 
is BergenBelsen?  We never heard of it.
 Okay. They told 
BergenBelsen was a 
concentration camp where they 
had about 50,000 Jews. This 
was the first time, the very 
first time, that we had ever h
eard of a concentration camp of
 Jews. This was the first time 
we had met any Jews. 
 
Q: How close did you physically
--how close did you personally 
get to that train?  Were 
you right on top of it?  
 
A: Well, I was not there the first day. 
 
Q: Okay . 
 
A: See, I was with the other unit, and this 
was the 743rd tank battali
on, which was part of 
our unit. They were the lead reconnaissance gr
oup that were up in  the very front. So th ey 

were the first ones to meet this group of pe
ople, and I didn't see th em actually  until the 
next day. 
 
Q: And when you did see them 
 
A: It was a horrible scene beca
use they had just been liberat
ed--I need to go
 back just a 
minute now. On th e 6th of Ap ril, the camp commander of Bergen Belsen was aware that 

the British troops were approaching his camp, 
and he wanted to ge
t the inmates of the 
camp out of there as quickly as he could so
 that they would not 
see the condition that 
these people were in. So on the 4th, 5th, and 
6th of April, they load
ed up three different 
trains loaded with ab out 2,500 Jews and 
sent them eastward 
towards a town of 
Theresienstadt, which was another concentra
tion camp. And that was going to be the 
final solution for these peop
le. So one was a train that
 actually did arrive at 
Theresienstadt, and the second train was captur
ed by the Russian Ar
my , and this was the 
third train that had come from B ergenBelsen. No
w, it took six days fo
r that train to come 
from BergenBelsen to Farslebe
n. That train was made up of what they call cattle cars--
cattle wagons. They 're like our sm
all freight trains. They're a smaller than our normal 

freight trains. We had used this type of freig
ht train in World War I, and we called them 
40 and 8s. Noting th
at each car was capable of handling 
40 men or 8 horses, and that was 
the general mode of transportation back in 
Wo rld War I, to move troops around by train. 
 
Q: Okay . 
 

A: So these are these cattle cars th ey call 
them, 40 and 8s, which we had put 40 men in. 
They  had 75 or 80 people in these cars. And th
ey were locked 
in there. In the corner of 
the car, they had what we woul
d normally term it like a five
gallon bucket that was their 
sanitary facility. And if you can imagine 75
 or 80 people crammed into one of those 
small freight cars, and the guy over here in th
e corner needs to reli
eve himself, there's no 
way that he can get over to that bucket and re
lieve hims elf. So the only alternative he had 
was just let it run down his legs. So this is
 the condition that we found th ese people in. 
After six days of standing--there was no way 
that they could sit or lay down --the only 
way they  could get on the floor was by exhaus
tion that they would just crumple and fall 

down to to floor, and th
ey just had to stay there. And th
at's the condition when  we open ed 
these cars u p  that we found these people, sti
nking from their feces and urine of six days, 
dirty, lice infested. It was a horrible sight. So
mething that we could not believe that was 
happening. 
 
Q: How did you react when you saw them, and 
how did they react wh
en they saw you as 
Americans? 
 
A: Well, we were reacted, yo
u know, we didn't believe what
 we were seeing. You know, 
we could co mmunicate very vaguely because th
e language barrier with these people, but 
to see and understand where they had come fro
m, the conditions that they had for those 
six days on the train, it was just nauseating to
 smell these people. We didn't dare to touch 
them because we were afra
id of getting lice on us, flea
s, Typhus--which was very 
ramp ant disease in those days. We didn't  want 
to actually touch these 
people at all. They 
wanted to  greet us and hug us 
and kiss us; so we just had to kind of rebel against them 
and not have any person
al contact with them as much as
 we could.Now,
 we understood 
where they  were coming from and the condition 
th at they had. They
 were hungry, they 
had only gotten one meal a day 
which consisted of a big buck
et of soup as they called it 
which was nothing more but a pail of water with
 some potato peelings 
or turnip  peelings 
in it. And they were very luck
y if they got a few of the turn
ip  peelings in th eir cup of 
soup that they got every day. 
 
Q: How were they clot
hed when  you saw th em? 
 
A: Well, some of them were fairly well clot
hed. The Du tch people and a few of the others 
were being held more as hostage for excha
nge purposes with the Americans fo r some of 
the German prisoners that we were holding. 
So they were in fair
ly good condition and 
clothing was fairly good, but for the mo st pa
rt, their clothes was very ragged. They were 
not in th e stripped prison uniforms that you ofte
n see in pictures. They were in their own 
civilian clothing, but they ha
d worn these clothes for mont
hs and months and months 
without any possibility of repair. 
If they got a tear in the clothi
ng, that was it. It's too bad. 
And the shoes, they were just worn out. Basi
cally there was nothing left of their shoes, 

just the tops. They were in
 horrible condition as far as
 clothing was concerned and 
hungry. 
 
Q: As best you could tell from the languages th
at they were speaking, and you when  you 
were speaking and interacting with them, wh
ere were these people coming from?  Were 
they primarily Germans?  Du
tch?  French?  Italians--
 
A: Oh no. These prisoners were from easte
rn  country:  Hungry, Poland, Romania, 
Ukraine, a number of them we
re from Holland, a few from Fr
ance. They were a varied 
nationalities, and this made the communicati
on with them more di
fficult because they 
spoke so many different foreign languages th at
 we understood nothing at all accept a few 
that--there was one girl in particular who 
was quite intelligent, and she was fluent in 
about six languages. So she was the main in
terpreter for this group. And a few of the 
others, they had a little bit of what we call Pi
geon English. They had 
a word here or there 
that they could fling out, and we could underst
and what they were trying to say. It was 
mo stly sign language, but we felt sorry for th
em because they were 
so hungry and th ey 
saw us in nice, clean uniforms, smoking cigare
ttes, and eating candy bars. They just went 
wild wh en we handed  them a candy bar or a pa
ck of cigarettes, and they were just be 
fighting over them. But the problem that we 
did not understand was that these people had 
not had an y kind of food for months. They 
were on a very , very limited ration, and we 
were eating high protein food, an d as we
 gave them a candy bar or chocolate or 
something th at we had in our po
cket, it was so--their bodies just could not assimilate this 
high protein food th at we had.
 And they would just gobbled 
it down, and as soon as they 
did, they  would thro w it up. And, of course
, by this time the medics--we had gotten the 
medics in there because there was just so
 many of these people were sick, and had 
medical problems that we had to  have the me
dical battalion come in and administer care 
to them. They said, "Hey, don't give these gu
ys any more food."  
And they took over 
from that point on to care for their feeding,  and they to ok our ratio
ns and diluted them 
down with water. 
 
Q: And what were the--you're talk ing about the rations that presumably the medical ward 
took over. Were those--what were 
those?  Were they Krations or 
 
A: Yeah, they would take our Krations and Cr
ations and water them 
down so that they 
were more easily assimilated by these people. 
 
Q: How long did it take to get those--the co
rpsmen and the medical personnel--their--how 
long of a delay was it before the time that you saw them?  
 
A: It was a matter of hours. 
 
Q: I see. 
 

A: Just a matter of hours, because they were 
lo cated with our division head quarters, and 
that's where I was at the time. 
 
Q: Right. 
 
A: That they were brought in
 there and administered help 
to them, and this was where I 
got assigned a job of moving 
these people aw ay from this point in Farsleben because 
actually this was still a battle zone, and we ha
d American artillery falling in the area. We 
had German artillery falling in the area. So we 
didn't w ant to have anymore casualties. So 
I was delegated then to round up
 transportation and take these people out of there to this 
town of Hillersleben that we had liberated 
a couple of days before where there was a 
barracks and a hospital. So I rounded up about
 60 or 70 vehicles a
nd got them loaded up 
and got them out of the area back to Hillersle
ben. And of course, the medical corps went 
with them, and they put the si
ck people in the hospital, and th e others went into the 
barracks, but first of all, as soon as we brou ght them back to Hillers
leben, they were so 

dirty and stinking and filthy that
 there was nothing th at we could do to give them clean 
clothing, so we had to have them strip thei
r clothing off, and the engineer battalion set up 
some shower points, and we 
started moving them through th
e showers--the first shower 
that they had had in months and years. And 
as soon as they got through the shower, of 
course, they  were given towels and soap, an d 
they were so happy to
 get cleaned up to 
little bit, but even through the s
hower, they could not get rid of
 the lice that were infested 
in their hair and in th eir pubic hairs. And so
 after they finished 
the shower, we dusted 
them with DDT. No w, DDT is today a proh
ibited item because it's  a carcinoginious[sic] 
item and is, by law, is prohibited fo r use. Bu
t at that time that was the best technology 
that we had to fight lice and fleas any 
kind of insect that they might have. 
 
Q: Did it work? 
 
A: It worked. So then we ha
d th e German people were ordere
d to bring clothing to this 
point and of course they were reclothed, an
d then the single people were put in the 
barracks. The married people were put in 
to so me of the private homes that w ere 
available. And at this point, I 
left them. They went back to
 my  unit and continued on my  
job, and we fought or way 
onto Magdeburg and we attacked
, captured Magdeburg on the 
18th of April, and as far as we
 were concerned, that was th
e end of the war. Because the 
Elm River which ran through Magdeburg was 
the demarcation line between us and the 
Russians. We could not go beyond that line. So
 we stopped fighting on the 18th of Ap ril, 

and just sat there and wait fo
r the Russians to come in fr
ont of us and move on into 
Berlin. But basically that was 
the end of the war, and that wa
s the first and only contact 
that we had ever had with any Jews, th
is group of the 2,500 on the train. 
 

And of course, in talking with some of th
em, we found out where 
they came from, and 
that they had been incarcerated
 at BergenBelsen, and they to
ld us a story about their life 
in Bergen Belsen and them being put on th
e train, and then we captured them. 
 
Q: Did th ey tell you about mass killings?  Did they tell you ab out-- 
 
A: Well, no because BergenBelsen was not a 
killing camp you might say. It was a camp  
where they worked 1215 hour
s a day, and the working conditions were not good. The 
food was not good. Their living 
conditions not good. Th
ey told us about 
their life there in 
BergenBelsen. I was going to sa
y they didn't have a large crematorium or gas chambers 
or anything like that in BergenBelsen. It was ju
st a slave labor camp, and part of it was an 
exchange camp , as I mentione
d before, to exchange the people for German prisoners, but 
they told us about the 
hardships they had, the life that 
they had, the living conditions in 
the barracks there at B ergenBels
en  was very bad. They  had b
unks, I think four high, and 
three or four people had to 
sleep in one bunk. The living co
nditions were very, very bad 
there at BergenBelsen. So this is basically th
e first time that we ever
 heard of Jews, slave 
labor, crematoriums, gas chambers. We never 
heard anything like that before. We could 
hardly  believe what they were telling us. 
And they got a lot of 
this information from 
some of the inmates who had co me Auschw
itz and Dachau were being overcrowded 
there, and they moved them in
to BergenBelsen, an
d then those prisoners in turn were 
telling the others about what was going on in 
these other camp s. That's how they knew 
what was going on there. And so, you know, 
we were not trained as humanitarians. We 
were trained as soldiers. And basically wh
en we saw this train and these Jews, the 
condition that they were 
in, we really didn't  know what 
to do. We did the best we could 
with wh at we had. Mo st of it was wrong,
 by feeding them the food the way we did. 
 
Q: Did your understanding 
of what you were fighting fo
r and why we you fighting 
change with that encounter? 
 
A: Well, we weren 't--as we were fighting acr
oss Europe, we weren't 
fighting to save any 
Jews. We didn't know about them. We were fi
ghting to  drive the Germans back out of 
these occupied countries, to give these people in Fran
ce, Belgium, and Holland--to give 
their freedom and liberty back th
at they had had back in  1940
 wh en they were invaded by 
the Germans. The Jewish situatio
n was just sort of a sidel ine 
that happened that we didn't 
know anything about. We didn't k n ow wh
at was going on until we 
saw, and then we 
believed. 
 
Q: And did that change your 
attitudes towards the Germans? 
 
A: Well, basically at th at point in time, it wa
s too late because here 
we are at the end of 
the war now. So from that point
 on, we didn't have mu ch contact with the Germans. The 
war was over. I think it was the 8th of May;
 so it was only about three weeks after we 
found this train that the war ended. Of course
, we didn 't  have any good feelings toward 

the Germans because th
ey were denying everything, and we
 knew that they were lying, 
that they were involved in it. They  kn
ew ab out it. They knew wh at was going on. 
 
Q: When  did you hear that the war had 
ended, and how did you hear about it? 
 
A: I'm sorry?  
 
Q: When did you hear that the war wa
s over, and how did you hear about it? 
 
A: Well, he were in Magdebur
g until--basically just sitting 
there waiting for the Russians 
to come up in front of us, and I think we
 got word through ou
r higher channels came 
down  to us that the war had o
fficially ended on the 8th of May. Like I say, we were in 
Magdeburg, liberated that on 
the 18th of April, and we 
could not cross the river to 
liberate anything more. We just had to sit there and wait for the Russians because that 
was declared to be their terr
itory. So we had to sit there 
from the 18th of Ap ril I think 
until about the 25th or 26t
h of April before the Russians ac
tually moved up in front of us, 
and we met with them. So of course we 
knew then the Russians were allocated that 
territory, which included the city
 of Berlin, and as soon as th
ey moved in front of us and 
on up to Berlin, they
 captured it, that the war was going to  be over very, very soon. 
 
Q: And did you meet with or inte
ract with any of the Russians?  
 
A: Yeah, we did. 
 
Q: What did you think of them? 
 
A: They were stinking, dirty bast
ards. They were very arrogant. 
 
Q: Did you write any letters home to your 
wife about what you experienced with that 
train?  
 
A: That I really don't remember. I did write to 
her basically every day. I'm sure that I did, 
but very unfortunately after I came home, she 
had piles of these letters that I w ritten to 
her. She had saved all my  letters, and she retu rn
ed letters wrote to me every day, which I 
saved and I would send them back to her, bu
ndles of them, back to her and sh e saved 
them. So when I came home, we had boxes and 
boxes of these letters, and what we were 
going to do with this stuff?  
We dumped it, and it was the worst thing I ever did because 
in those liters I wrote to her in sort of a 
coded way where I was what I was doing because 
all of our mail was censored because we were 
not allowed to tell where we were or what 
we were doing. 
 
Q: Sure. 
 
A: But in a coded way I could relate to he
r wh ere I was and what I was doing. So all 
those things were in there, and the men that 
I had contact with from day to day, the things 
that I did from day to day. That
 was a historical document, and we just threw all of that 

away because I know all that 
stuff. I can remember all th
ose people. But now today, I 
can 't remember those things. 
 
Q: Sure. Wh en did you get word  that you we
re going to be sent back  to the States? 
 
A: I'm sorry again?  
 
Q: When  did you get wo rd th at you were 
going to be sent back to the States? 
 
A: Oh, when  we ended the war, basically th
e 8th of May, we m
oved southward about 
50 miles into an area of occupation, and it was 
at that time we were notified that the 30th 
Division was prioritized to co me back to the States and have a 15day leave and do some 
30day training and go to the Paci
fic and help finish the war in
 the Pacific. So we were 
geared for that, and that was 
in probably in July
. So in midearly August, we started 
moving back  thro ugh France and to  England in
 preparation to return to the States, and 

while we were in England, they  dropped th
e bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. And that, 
in fact, ended the war, and we felt right then
 and th ere that we would not--have--we may 
have to go to the Pacific, but
 there would not be any war to 
be fought as we had planned. 
We came home, and we were given a 30day l
eave and during that time, the Great White 
Fathers of Washington were mu lling over wh at are we going to  do with all these guys 

now. We don't need them anymore. The war in
 the Pacific is over. So they sent telegrams 
to everybody telling them to report to their near
est military installati
on for further orders, 
which they did. And the most 
of them got their discharge, 
and that ended their military 
service. 
 
Q: But you stayed on? 
 
A: I stayed on. We had the oppo
rtunity  to volunteer to stay in service or take a discharge, 
and I volunteered to stay in 
service, and so I reported back
 to the 30th Division, which 
was then we head quartered at Fort Jackson 
in South Carolina; so 
I remained there for 
about six months. I was comp any commander of
 the 5th Corp s Headquarters Comp any, 
and at the end of that six months, we were 
given the opportunity to
 go to  another station 
in occupation duty, and we we
re given the opportunity to
 like the Caribbean, Panama 
area, Hawaii, and a few other places plus Ja
pan and Europe. Well, 
of course Japan and 
Europe were at the bottom of my  list and actua
lly the Hawaii or the Caribbean were at the 
top of the list, and that's what I chose, but 
what did I get?  I got orders to go back to 
Europe. So I went back to Europe and was 
stationed in  Frankfurt Germany and remained 
there for three years. Now, 
during that time, after I wa
s over there fo r about four 
five months, dependants were allowed to co
me over and join us. So
 my  wife came to  
Frankfurt, and we lived there, and that
's where we had our family--I'm sorry. 
 
Q: Lets back up ju
st for a little bit. 
 
A: Yeah. 
 

Q: In terms of returnin
g to the United States. 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Do you recall the first time 
that you saw your wife again? 
 
A: Oh yeah. Going back to 
the time we left England th at we came home on the Queen 
Marry, commuted to New York, a
nd went to Camp  Kilmer, Ne
w Jersey, and that's where 
we were given our leave. So I took the tr
ain and went to Boston
. No w, during the time 
that I was in Europe, my wife
 stayed with my 
mother in Boston--a
lthough her home was 
in Florid a--she chose to say with my  mo ther
 during that time. So when I got home, of 
course I got to the train, took me into Bo ston
, and I got in a cab to take me to my  home, 
and it was a pretty emotional reunion. Of co
urse I had sent telegrams to them and 
telephoned called tellin g them that I was coming.
 So they were aware that I was going to 
be there. 
 
Q: And what was that day like?  Do 
you remember it?  Tell me about it. 
 
A: Well, I can 't really remember that very 
well, but I know it was very emotional. I had 

not seen my  wife in 11 months, and to  be 
alive and back  with her again, it was a very, 
very pleasant reunion. And of co urse, my  mo th
er was there too, and to be alive was the 
main thing. We never knew all 
through the war when
 the silver bullet was going to hit us, 
and that would be the end,
 but I was very fortunate 
that I dodged the bullet. 
 
Q: So let's go back to  Frankfurt. Your wife 
has joined you. You're now starting a family. 
What was that experience like?  Were yo
ur children born there in Germany?  
 
A: Yes. She came over in the--let me see
--in the fall of '46, 
and we were given a 
preference of having a house in Frankfurt. A
nd eight months later, sh
e delivered twins in 
the 97th General Hospital. That was the beginning of our fami ly. 
 
Q: Okay . 
 
A: And then exactly one year later, we had a 
son born. Also in the 
97th General Hospital. 
Now, although they were born in Frankfurt,
 Germany, I, being an American citizen and 
she also--they were registered with the United 
States emb assy there, 
and they are actually 
American citizens, alth ough 
they  were born in Germany. 
 
Q: And did they--did  you stay long 
enough for them to go school there? 
 
A: Oh, no. No. No. The girls we
re two years old, and my  son was 1 year old, and it was 
then that we made a decision to terminate-
-my contact was coming to an end, and we 
decided to terminate th e contact and come back 
to the states. So in 
'49 we came back to 
the states. 
 
Q: And where did you settle, and what did you do?  
 

A: Well, we came back to Boston and lived 
there for a few months, and then  we went 
down the Florida to live with her parents fo
r a few months. And we decided that Florida 
was a better location because we had just lived
 there in Boston through a winter, and it 
was very cold, and I got tired of shoveling 
snow. So we decided to settle in Florida. 
 
Q: So what did you do in Florida?  
 
A: I went back to school for a while and studi
ed computer work and got a job there at the 
University of Florida as an office manager in
 the computing center that they had at the 
university at the time. 
 
Q: And you've been employed ever since? 
 
A: I've been here ever since. We built our 
house here in 1950 and 
been right here ever 
since. 
 
Q: Now, that experience with those people on that
 train, that really wa
sn't the end of it for 
you, was it? 
 
A: No. I never gave it much thought until--I 
guess in the 80s, we were cleaning out some 
junk in somewhere, holdings, 
and I came across a little notebook
s that I had kept sort of a 
diary in. And I had a lot of info rmation about th
is train--the encounter with that train, and 
I just stopped to think about those days and t
hose people, and I thought that that would be 
a good historical document. And so I took all 
the notes that I had in those notebooks and 
kind of put them together 
in a handwritten document this was before the days of 
computers really, and--but a little later, wh
en computers--when 
the university got 
involved with computer
s, I started transferring all that 
stuff into my computer. Well, I 
had this document there and still 
did nothing with it, just a doc
ument for future historical 
purposes, but it was not until 2005 that I had 
the opportunity to go 
back the Magdeburg, 
Germany. Now, this was a little story in 
itself. A few years before this, I had had 
communication with  a young girl in Magdeb ur
g who was work ing at the Univ ersity of 
Magdeburg on her Ph.D  thesis 
which was on the liberation of
 Magdeburg. No w, when we 
left Magdeburg in May of 1945, this became
 a part of the Russian zone. The Russians 
moved in to Magdeburg and they  purged ev erythi
ng that was in the libraries an d schools, 
archives, any documents that were in Eng
lish and anything that was related to the 
liberation of Magdeburg. They instilled in the 
people of Magdeburg 
that they were the 
liberators of Magdeburg. And fo r the next 40 ye
ars, that was the belief that the people of 
Magdeburg were brought up in. So the young girl
 work ing on her thesis of the liberation 
of Magdeburg writing to me indicated that th
e Russians claimed that they had liberated 

Magdeburg, but friend of hers
 had a book which said someth
ing ab out the Americans had 
liberated Magdeburg. What is the truth? Now,
 she had found my na
me in the computer. 
I'm not sure just how she fo
und it, but she found my  na
me connected with the 30th 
Division, and so  she was asking this Q: 
 How did the Ameri
cans really liberate 

Magdeburg?  Well, of course I sent her back
 copies of pages from some of our history 
books and from my  own personal knowledg
e about the liberation of Magdeburg on the 
16th of the April, 1945. She put this all toge
ther and wrote up her th
esis, and she did get 
her Ph.D. but she took
 that document to the mayor of 
Magdeburg, and he was rather 
surprised to know that the 
Americans actually had liberated
 Magdeburg. He was always 
of the impression that the Russians had liber
ated Magdeburg. No w, we're coming up on 
April of 2005, which then was 
going to be the--I think the 40
th or 50th anni
versary of the 
liberation--this just happened to  coincide with
 the 1200th anniversary 
of the founding of 
the City of Magdeburg. So th
ey  were planing to have a bi
g celebration on the anniversary 
of the founding of Magdeburg as well as the 
liberation of Magdeburg. So  in doing so , and 
unknown to me at the time, th
ey invited a man who had been 
in a slave labor camp there 
in Magdeburg. Now, in Magdeburg, ther
e was a pulte ammunition work s which was 
making ammunition for the German war ma
chine, and this was operated by slave 
laborers, Je wish slave laborers, which ha
d come from Buchen wald . And we, the 30th 
Division, had actually liberated this slave lab o
r camp,  and that was in a matter of a few 
days after we had liberated the Farsleben 
group. Anyway , the mayor, through another 
person, invited this ma n who--this Jew who ha
d been a slave laborer in Magdeburg in  the 
pulte ammunition works to co
me back to Magdeburg to
 tell the people about his 
incarceration. At the same time he invited me
 to come to Magdebur
g to tell the people 
about the actual liberation by 
the Americans. So 
for the first time
, when I got to 
Magdeburg, I met this man, the man who--the
 Jew that I had liberated in 1945. So we 
work ed up a nice relationship, and I found that
 he lived in Boca Ra
ton, Florida, about 
three hours away from where I 
lived. So this was a fascina
ting thing that I, a liberator, 
and he, a Jewish slave laborer, 
should end up living so  close 
together here in Florida. 
 
Q: And have you been in co
mmunication with him since?  
 
A: I was. I'm sorry. He just died about a 
month ago. Anyway , after we came back from 
Magdeburg, he sent me an email saying, "Frank, 
look at this web site. 
It is tremendous."  
And I opened up the web site, and it was a web 
site created by a history teacher up in  the 
Hudson Falls, New York, and it was a
bout a tank co mma nder of the 743rd Tank 
Battalion having liberated a train in Magdebur
g. Well, I read the whole story through, 
and it was exactly the story that I related to you.
 And how did this guy 
get this story?  So 
I got in contact with this teach
er to find out what his relati
onship was to this web site and 
story. And it seems that he 
was a World War II history buff, but he was at the time 
concentrating on the Holocaust.
 And he gave his cl
ass a project to go 
out in the village 
and see if you can contact a ve
teran who had anything to do 
with his connection with the 
Holocaust. The students 
brought their stories in, and read
 them. They discussed them, but 
there was one boy who had a very  unique 
story--that his grandfather was a tank 
commander in the 743rd Tank Battalion, and they 
had captured  this train with 2,500 Jews 
on it. Well, that's  exactly my st
ory. So I got together with 
this teacher and we discussed 

his side of it, and I told him my  connec
tion with it. And so  we'v e been sort of 
collaborating together ever since. Now, at the 
time, he put his web site out he got in--his 
story went out on th e Internet, and the firs
t hit that he had on it was from a lady in 
Australia. Now, she was a young girl on that 
train, and her family moved to Australia at 
that time, and of course she's 
been there ever since, and she 
saw that web site, and she got 
back in contact with the teac
her, and th rough that--and then he
 had tw o or three other hits 
up in  New York . So when I was discussing this
 ma tter with him, he had probably about 
10 or 12 Jews that he had ha
d contact with who were on that train. Well, I said, you 
know, I've got this story about 
the train, and want to get invo
lved in it. So I went on the 
Internet and put my  story out, and I started ge
tting hits on it. And it just snowballed, and 
eventually I got in contact w
ith a person in  Israel who ha
d been  a young boy. He had 
been orphaned, and went
 to Israel--or went to Palestine 
and was adopted by a family, was 
educated there in Tel Aviv, and he became
 a docto r, a medical docto r and had practiced 

and just retired when I first got in contact
 with him. He could not speak very good 
English, and it was very difficult for me to 
understand him, but hi
s daughter was quite 
interested, and she co uld speak mu ch better En
glish than  he could; although it was kind 
of broken up. So she became very
 interested in his story beca
use, as with many of these 
Jews, as th ey grew up, they wa
nted to forget the past. They  wanted to forget about the 
Holocaust and not even talk about
 it to their families. So she 
was interested in it, and she 
wanted to  hear mo re about it, wanted to learn 
what her father had been through. So I gave 
her the whole story as I could recall, and sh
e became very much involved in it. And her 
father originally was from Budapest, he was 
Hungarian, and he rememb ered the names of 
some of the people, and she started researchi
ng there in Israel for some of those people, 
and she fo und a number of them. So this 
increased our numb ers of people who had 
survived this train. Now, go
ing back just a bit on this--onthe train originally, there was 
about 2,500 people, and of them, there were
 about 600 children. Now, I say children. 
These are people 21 years of age and less. 
 
Q: Okay . 
 
A: Now, the Germans were quite meticulous ab
out keeping records. When that train left 
BergenBelsen, and we captured it there at Fars
leben, the train comm ander had a list of all 
the people that were on that train. That 
list contained th eir name, their birth date, and 
their birthplace, and of course other data t
oo that was not really relevant. That document 
was taken and retained by what
 is now the BergenBelsen Me
morial, and I got a copy of 
that list and went through it and since it had 
the birth date of everybody that was on the 
train, I could determine who the children were. 
So I sorted out all th
e children in the 600 
names, and of those--I just assumed half of 
them were deceased because of malnutrition, 
age, and other causes. So 
we're down to about the possi
bility of 300plus surviving 
children out there somewhere. So
 with this young la
dy in Israel doing some research and 
finding some of these people and some of my
 research through the Internet, I have found 

235 of these people, and I've been in contact with each one either by mail physical (phone 
interference) 
 
Q: Can you say that last part again?  We had 
a trifle bit of audio difficulty, I lost you at 

you were contacting them by email. 
 
A: Either by email or snail mail. 
 
Q: Okay . And how many 
did you contact?  
 
A: I've contacted 235. 
 
Q: And they--did most of
 them respond to you? 
 
A: I'm sorry?  
 
Q: Did mo st of them respond to  you? 
 
A: Oh yes, yes. In fact, I'm in contact with
 them right now trying
 to get any kind of 
documents, copies of documents, that they might
 have. Now, I need to 
go back here just a 
little bit. At the time of the lib
eration, these people I'm talkin
g about today, they were all 
young kids. 
 
Q: Sure. 
 
A: 21 years and less. Those who were ten ye
ars and younger, they  really don't reme mb er 
mu ch . 
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: It's the group that's 10 to 
21 they have a little memory of
 what was happening. Prior to 
the war, their parents could see the handwriti
ng on the wall, what was happening to  the 
Jews. And th ey were starting to make arrangeme
nts to get out of Europe to get away from 
Hitler and the program that he had to eliminat
e the Jews. So many of
 them had obtained 
passports from various countries wherever they
 would be accepted. No w, in those years, 
there was a great deal of antiSemitism that Un
ited States did not want these Jews. They 
had a very , very limited quota, and that's all th
ey would take in here. So these people got 
passports to South American countries, Aust
ralia, African countrie s, Canada. Some got 
passports to the United States. So whatever
 place these p eople had passports for, that's 
where they went. They went--they scattered a
ll over the world becaus
e they were citizens 
of that country. 
 
Q: Sure. 
 
A: And we at the time of the liberation furn
ished transp ortation to them to whatever 
country they  had a passport for. No w, just la
st night, I was talking with a girl--lady in 

Australia, by Skype, and she said she had just 
found two more girls or
 ladies in Australia. 
So that is the way this thing sn owballed.
 
Q: Yes.
 
A: So I got two mo re people that I've got to
 start researching in Australia. But we had a 
lot of them come here to the United States 
too, but must of them are settled up in around 
the New York area. 
 
Q: Okay . 
 
A: There's very few here in Florida, and th
ere's a group up in Carolina and a few out in 
California, and they're just scattered all over. 
So two years ago, this  young lady in Israel 
thought it would be a nice idea to have a reun
ion of some of these people. So we--she 
sent word  out to them, and I sent word  out to
 the people in the States about a reunion th at 
they wanted  to have in April--two and a half
 years ago. So we have
 this reunion in her 
town in Rehovot, which is 
between Tel Aviv and Jerusale
m. And we had 60 of the 
survivors plus their children and grandch
ildren--total about 500 people. And we 
assembled at the Weizmann Ins
titute there in Rehovot. They
 had a large auditorium in 
which we met. 
 
Q: What was that like seeing them again 
now as grown people who had made lives 
 
A: It was very emotional to meet these peop
le that I had had a little hand in liberating 
6569 years ago. And they were very  receptive 
and very thankful to me to be one of their 
liberators, and in  fact I have 
been the only liberat
or that they had ever met. And it was a 
very emotional meeting to be with these peop
le, to physically see some of those people, 
and the th ing is the mo st of them had never 
met each other before because they  came to 
Israel, staggered, at different times by differe
nt routes, and ended up in different places. 
Some went to Jerusalem, some w h et the 
Tel Aviv, and all the 
little kibbutz's all over 
Israel--Palestine at that time. 
 
Q: Sure. 
 
A: And so th ey were really never had any co
ntact with each other, and this was the first 
time that th ey had contact with each other as 
well as me, as a liberator. Now, the most of 
these survivors had never talked
 about the Holocaust 
to their families. As they grew up, 
they just wanted to fo
rget the bad memories there--that th
ey just wanted to forget it. The 
day of their liberation, that was the day of 
a new life for them. Anything before that, they 
just wanted to forget ab out it and not ta
lk about it. The children would ask them, you 
know, what happened ?  I don't want to talk 
about it. Forg et it. 
And we'll talk about 
something else. And this was 
going on for years until this re
union time--that I told the 
story--the one that I more or less had relate
d to you now to these 
children, and they are 
learning for the first time what happened to
 their parents, a 
little bit about the 

BergenBelsen era, but mostly 
from the actual liberation period, which they 
knew nothing 
about. All they knew wa
s what their parents had told  them from th e time they grew up in 
Israel or wherever they we
re up until the present time. 
 
Q: Sure. 
 
A: So th is was a whole new story for thes
e children and grandchildren to learn about 
something about the liberation of
 their people. Now, what one person in particular, girl 
named lily, she was from Warsaw, and sh e had lo
st both of her parents to Auschwitz, and 
as an orphan, she was being taken care of by 
various other women. And she lived through 
BergenBelsen with them. And on 
the day of their liberation, th
e 13th of April, she said, 
"That is my  birthday."  She did not now ex
actly wh ere she was born. She did not know 
exactly when she was born, so she took th at day 
of liberation, the 13th of Ap ril, 1945, as 
her birth date, and she has considered that her 
birth date ever since. This is one example 
of their feeling toward their 
liberation--that they feel that
 day of liberation was a very 
prominen t and famous day as far as they were
 concerned--the beginni
ng of their life. And 
so many of them have told me  that their life began on th e 13t
h of April, 1945. Anything 
before that never happened. They
 just wanted to forget it. 
 
Q: There are those who would say and thos
e who do say that the Ho locaust never 
happened . What would you say to them? 
 
A: You should have been ther
e. If you'd have seen it and sm
elled it, you'd believe. That's 
all I can tell them. 
 
Q: Well, sir, it was an outstanding interview. 
Thank you for your time
 and for your story.
 
A: Okay . 
 
Q: But mo st of all, I thank you 
for your service to our nation. 
 
A: Thank you very much. It has been a pleasu
re for me to do this and to contact these 
people and get their information and be able to
 relate that with others. Now, I must add 
on here that our 30th infantry 
division has annual reunions, 
and I think it was about five 
years ago we had a re
union at Fayetteville, a
nd we invited as many 
as would come of 
these survivors, and we had I think it was ei
ght came to our reunion in Fayetteville. So 
we--we're work ing up a close relationship with
 these people. In fact, we just had a 
reunion in Savannah two weeks a
go, and we had four of them
 come. Unfortunately, this 
was during the storm period up in the north
, and several had plan
ned to come were 
unable to join with us, but we did have one co me from Jerusa
lem--him and his wife flew 
over, got here just before the storm hit, and 
was able to get into 
Savannah. And I think it 
was last year or the year before, we had tw o 
people from Jerusalem co
me an d join just for 
this purpose, to join with their liberators a
nd some others of their surviving peers. So 
we're working up a close relationshi
p with these people today. Yup. 
 

Q: Very good. 
 
A: Yeah. So I'm working on this project no
w and trying to get in contact with the two 
new people down in Australia. 
 
Q: Excellent. Thank you, sir. 
 
A: Okay . Fine and nice ta
lking with you, Steve. 
 
Q: Nice talking to you, sir. 
Thank you very  mu ch indeed. 
 
A: If I can help any further, give me a call back. 
 
Q: We will indeed. 
Thank you so much. 
 
A: Thank you. 
 
Q: Be well. 
 
Conclusion of Interview
