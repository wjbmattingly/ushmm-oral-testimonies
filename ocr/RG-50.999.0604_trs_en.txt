In thisphoto we see Marcelle and hism other, Laura, in 
1934.
 
  
 
Germ any andtheSoviet Union attacked Poland inSeptem ber
 
1939, beginning World 
W a r I I .
 
T his is an historical photographof  Germ an troops parading throughW arsaw after the 
surrender of  Poland.
 
  
On June
 
22, 1941, Germ any violated the German
-
S o vi e
t pact and attacked Soviet 
t e rri t o ry.
 
W ithin afew weeks Drohobycz was occupied by Germanforces.
 
In 1942, members of  
Marcel's fam ily, including his grandf ather, whom  we see here, were deported toexterm ination 
cam ps where they were murdered.
 
 
In  the  fa ll 
of 1942, Marcel and hisfam ily were  forced intothe Drohobyc z ghetto.
 
T h is  is  
an historical photograph of  Jews beingf orced into the Drohobycz gh etto.
B
efore the liquidation 
of  the ghetto,thef am ily escapedtoa small vi llage.

In August
 
1943, Marcel went
 
into hiding with a Polish
-
Uk ra in ia n f amily.
 
Here we see 
photos of Jan Sawinski and Zof iaSawinski, thef am ily who hid Marcel andhisf am ily.
 
  
Marcel's fam ily is seen in thisphoto taken in1947 or 1948.
 
From  left to right we see 
Marcel's uncle,Abraham  D
rim er, his parents, Laura and Jacob, and Marcel's uncle, Abraham  
Gruber.
 
  
 
In 1957, Marcel earned adegree inm echanical engineering. He imm igrated to the 
United States in1961where his wif e Ania joinedhim  in 1963. Soon af terarrival in the U.S. he 
wa s
 
hired by the U.S.Post Office Departm ent to work on thedesign of m ail sorters and 
conveyors.
 
Af ter a very successful period with thePost Off ice Departm ent, Marcel transferred 
to the U.S. Arm y asacivi lian in 1972. He then worked as a mechanical enginee
rf o r t he  A rm y 

Corps of  Engineers.
 
Although Marceloff icially retiredf rom  theArm y in 1994, he remained a 
consultant with the Arm y until 2010. He is now trul y retired.
 
   
 
Ania trainedas a pharm acist in Polandand continuedherprof ession af ter herarri
va l  
in the U.S.and is now also retired.
 
Marcel and Ania have a son Adam  who lives in Richm ond. 
T hey have two grandchildren, Mary, age 15,and Jack, who is 17.They are both in the 

International Baccalaureate program .
 
  
 
Althoughoff icially Marcel and Ania are retired, they both do considerable work as 
volunteers with them useum.
 
Marcel andAnia translate docum entswritten in Polish.T hey 
translated portions of  Em anuel Ringelblum 's Notes f rom  theW arsaw Ghetto, a 25,000
-
p age  
collectionof  diaries and other
 
docum ents detailing the eventsand lives of those who lived in 
thedoom edW arsaw Ghetto. T hey also recently translated personalm em oirs by two Jewis h 

young wom en who suffered terribly during the war. In appreciationf or the translations, the 

f a m ilie s  of  t
hese wom en donated generously to thism useum .
 
  
Marcel andAnia also worked on the currentm useum  exhibit titled," SomeWere 
Neighbors: Collaboration and Complicity in the Holocaust,"  which opened in 2013.
 
T o help with 
theexhibit, they reviewed andtransc
ribed several f ilm ed testimonies and m ade 
recomm endationsabout their potential signif icanceto theexhibit.They are quite a team .
 
  
 
Marcel speakspublicly abouthis Holocaust experience in various settings. He was a 
speaker with Mia Farrow at an event in Gettysburg, Pennsyl vania, and spoke to cadetsf rom 

ourf our m ilitary academ ies who were on their wa y to visit Auschwit z. Marcel also speaks to 

studentsandf aculty at universities andf ederal agencies including the FBI just a coupleof  

weeks ago.
 
  
 
Ma
rcel recently donated photographs of great signif icance to him  aswell as a ring 
which played a role in his survi val, which we wi ll hear m ore about later. And we hope to hear 

about a trip Marcel and Ania tooktohis hom etown of  Drohobycz last  year.

[Applause]
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Thankyou all for being here.
 
And 
Marcel, thank youfor being with us today 
andfor your will ingness to be our First Person today.
 
W ehave such a short period and yo
u 
have som uch to 
share 
with us.
 
W e will cover what we can and get started.
 
 
W orldW ar II began inSeptember
 
1939, when Germ any attacked Polandf rom  the 
west f ollowed quickly by the Soviet Union attacking f rom  theeast.
 
Earl y in the war you and 
yo u r f am ily
 
li ved under Russianoccupation.
 
But bef ore we turn to that time,before we turnto 
the war and the Holocaust, tell us just a littlebit about your fam ily and your com munity before 

the war began.

>> Ma rc e l D ri m e r:
 
My f am ily consisted of  m y father,m
o the r, 
and younger sister, Irine
. 
A n d  m y 
father was the oldestof f ive siblings.
 
My m other was the oldestof four siblings.
 
My f ather was 
an accountant, as yousaid earlier, at the lumberf actory.
 
And we lived above the offices.
 
W e 
usedthe lumberfactory as our playground,my sister and I.
 
 
Drohobycz was basically known f or oil
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Big ref ineries.
 
>> Ma rc e l D ri m e r:
 
Rig h t .
 
As am atter off act,one of m y grandf athers worked in the ref inery.
 
Drohobycz was the biggest producer of gasoline inthe beginning of the 20th Century.
 
So this 
was the industry.
 
 
About the people, Drohobycz was a town of  three nationalities living in peace:
 
Ukrainians, Pols, and Jews, about 16,000, 17,000each of these groups.
 
People had their own 
sports clubs.
 
I had an uncle who 
was a goodsoccer player.
 
I rem ember watching him and 
scream ing, 
U
n c l e,  
U
ncle.
 
T his was m y m other's youngest brother.
 
He was a wonderf ulperson.
 
 
And the Jews had their buildings there, theaters, clubs.
 
And so did the Ukrainians in 
their own language and sodid the Pols.
 
T heJews had even a high school that was a Jewi sh 
high school.
 
Lif e was good.
 
W e didn't know really what we m issed because Ionly realized that 
when I cam e to Am erica.
 
But we were happy at that tim e.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
That, of  course, was ab
out to change.
 
On September
 
17, 1939, Russia 
attacked Poland.
 
As aresult, you would live under Russian occupation until June of 1941.
 
W hat was that time like when you were under the Russians until June of 1941?
 
>> Ma rc e l D ri m e r:
 
About one
-
third of  Poland 
was occupiedby the Russians.
 
They tried to 
m a ke 
--
 
at thattime they tried tom ake thatpart of Poland likeone of the republics of the Soviet 
Union.
 
T hey nationalized factories, big buildings.
 
T hey kickedout people that they considered 
enem ies of  their 
state.
 
T hey sent them  to Siberia.
 
Am ong these people were theparents of m y 
wi f e .
 
They were not
 
--
 
well, thef ather was a doctor andm other wasa lawyer.
 
T he Soviets 
didn't trust people that were very sm art.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
They considered them bourgeois.
 
>> Ma rc e l D ri m e r:
 
Ye s .
 
They didn't want toaccept Soviet passportso they were sent toSiberia 
where m y wif e was born.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And Ania is right in the front row.
 
>> Ma rc e l D ri m e r:
 
Her father delivered her and they survi ved there.
 
W ei n D r o h ob yc z k
n e w 
what was going on in the western part of Poland.
 
So when the Germ ans attacked Poland 
later
 
--
 
I'm  getting a little ahead.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Just a couple more questions.
 
Since you were under the Russians, som eof 
your uncles even joined the Russian Arm y.
 
Is th a t righ t?
 
>> Ma rc e l D ri m e r:
 
W ell, they didn't join.
 
T hey were draf ted.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
D r af t ed .
 O k. 
>> Ma rc e l D ri m e r:
 
Yeah.
 
W ell, mostof m y uncles were drafted tothe Russian Arm y.
 
T hey 
foughtagainst the Germ ans.
 
T wo of  them  were killed but the oth
ers survi ved.
 
T hose that were 
deportedor ran with the Russian Arm y whether theGermansattacked,about 80%
 
--
 
ab o ut 
90% survived.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Thosewho went with the Russians.
 
>> Ma rc e l D ri m e r:
 
It wasn't a picnicbut it was
 
--
 
it was a ver y hard lif e but they survi ved.
 
B u t 
those that stayed under the Germ an occupation,about95%perished.

>> Bill Benson:
 
One more question about that period.
 
Your birth d
ate, May
 
1, I'd like to ask you 
--
 
it's a signif icant date in the Comm unist world.
 
T ell us about the signif icance of  that date for 
you because of your birthday.
 
>> Ma rc e l D ri m e r:
 
W ell, I justturned 83 on May
 
1, so it's an important date.
 
My father had two 
sisters who were m embers of the Com munist Party of  Poland.
 
My f ather was sort of leaning in 
that dir
ection.
 
Ma y
 
1 was a holiday, a Labor Day.
 
So I was born inm y grandparents' house.
 
A 
doctor came thereand delivered me and went away.
 
And m yf athera couple of days laterhad 
to go to the authoritiesand reportm y birth.
 
So hedecided to
 
--
 
I was actually
 
born April
 
30 but 
m y f atherdecided thatm aybe it's going tobenice if  he would be born May
 
1, holidays andso 
fo rth .
 
S o  I am  bo r n
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Of f ic ia lly Ma y
 
1.
 
>> Ma rc e l D ri m e r:
 
Don't tell anybody.
 
>>
 
[Laughter] 
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Marcel, soon after Germ any turnedonthe Soviet Union in Juneof 1941, then, 
of  course, Germ an troops occupied Drohobycz and lifefor you andyour f amily and theother 
Jews in Drohobycz ch anged dramatically and tragically.
 
T ell us what the Nazis did after they 
took control
 
of  Drohobyc z and what thism eantf or youand yourf am ily.
 
>> Ma rc e l D ri m e r:
 
Ye s .
 
They started their hellish action July
 
1 and 2.
 
Even before they came, 
they contacted the Ukrainiannationalists,anti
-
Sem ites, and they told them  thef irstfew days 
you wi ll
 
have the right to go to the Jewish hom esand do whatever you want to.
 
 
So when they came, when the Germ ans came, bands of  Ukrainiannationalists would 
run throughf rom  house
-
to
-
house.
 
They would beatpeople and grab what they wanted.
 
Am ong 
o th e rs, m y m ate
rnal grandfather was beatenup.
 
W e couldn't takehim  to a hospital because 
there was no hospitalsfor the Jews, so he died in 10 days.
 
 
I had an aunt who was in the biggest university town, near Drohobycz.
 
She was also 
killed by the Germ ans.
 
In that town about5,000 Jews were killed thef irstfew days.
 
In  
Drohobycz, about80people were killed, am ong them m y grandfather and about 600 were 

wounded.
 
Soonthef irst day,f irst day of Germ an occupation,I lostm y grandfather and an 
aunt.
 
 
But what they did, what the Germ ans did, they had abig list of  things what the Jews 
cannot do.
 
W hat can do wasn't much but what they cannot do.
 
Children were notallowed to go 
to school, Jewish children were not.
 
Christian children were allowedto go through thefourth 
gr a d
e because they were supposed to be the slave laborf orGermans and they would need to 
know som eelem entary, I think, and reading.
 
But the Jews were to be killed so they didn't need 
any education.
 
 
T hey ordered Jews towear an arm band with theStarof  David on it.
 
They established 
a ration system  that people couldbuy only or get food about up to300
-
calories, which you 
couldn't live on.
 
And they also started aktion.
 
Af ter thef irstone it was just many, many like 
th a t.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Anaktion is action.
 
>> Ma rc e l D ri m e r:
 
In Germ an.
 
I 'm  s o rry.
 
Butthere were aktions.
 
T his is when they would go to 
Jewish hom es and take whatever they wanted away.
 
And the killing aktion, they would kill or 
sendpeople to the concentration
 
--
 
e xt e r m i nat i o n  c am p.
 
 
I'll go back 
a  lit t le .
 
W hen the robbers robbed m y grandfather and alm ost killed him , 
they tookout photo album s, several photoalbum s,and shookoutthe photos into mudand 

took the album s.
 
Af ter the war m y father went thereto look at what's lef t of the grandparent's 

5 
 
house that was gonebut aneighbor came and gave father a stack of photos which he picked 
up f rom  m ud.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Som eof  the photos that we saw?
 
>> Ma rc e l D ri m e r:
 
Som e of  the photos you have seen here and Bill m entioned about the 
donation.
 
I donated all of  these photos to the Holocaust Museum.
 
They m ade m e beautif ul 
copies.
 
Butall of these photosare in the Holocaust Museum .
 
And ifyou Google m y nam e, you 
can see all of thesephotos.
 
 O k.  

>> Bill Benson:
 
One of thethings I know during thatperiod that youwant to tellus about, and 
that isthe early stages of  theoccupation before you were f orced to go tothe ghetto, you had 

hada nanny beforethe war.
 
T ell us aboutthe signif icanceof  the visit you m ade to your nanny.
 
>> Ma rc e l D ri m e r:
 
Ye s .
 
I n  m y 
house, inm y apartment, there were m y two grandparentsand 
oneaunt with two children whose husband was taken to the Russian Arm y.
 
T he grandparents 
couldnot work, so they would stay with us.
 
My f ather was theonly one that was working.
 
B u t 
hem anaged to barter things forf ood.
 
He would,f orexam ple, exchange a ring for two loaf sof  
bread.
 
So these people stayed with us andthey
 
--
 
you know, it was quite crowded.
 
 
I had ananny, her nam e was Jancia.
 
Idon'trem em ber her last nam e.
 
She loved m e 
ver y m uch and
 
I lovedher, too.
 
She would com eto visit us.
 
She brought som e food, m ilk, and 
played with m e.
 
And one day she offered m y m other
 
--
 
I had some sickness.
 
I wasn't feeling 
good.
 
So  she  sa ys,  
I'lltake Marceltom y house and I'll give him  abath
 a
n d I  will 
f e ed
 
him  and I 
wi ll bring him  back.
 
 
And m y sister
 
--
 
af tera day or two m y sister started complaining thatshe would like to 
get m e back to play wit h her.
 
I was two years older.
 
Iam  two years older than she is.
 
She is 
still alive, thanks God.
 
And she ba
rtered andbartered som y m other said,ok, we'll go andget 
Marcel back.
 
So she took off herarm  band then.
 
 
By the way, if  you wer e Jewish and you would take out your arm band,and they would 
discover that you were Jewish, this was death.
 
T hey could kill you on the spot.
 
My m other was 
blond and blue
-
eye sod she looked not very Jewish.
 
 
So she went to Jancia's house.
 
She came with Irene.
 
AndI was sitting in the corner 
and crying.
 
And Jancia was gi vin g birth to a baby.
 
She was in theninthm onth and there w
a s 
nobody.
 
I was theonly onethere.
 
T here was no telephone.
 
Herhusband was workin g.
 
S o  m y 
m other cam e and didwhat she could.
 
She boiled som e water and, you know, delivered the 
baby.
 
But the baby wa s stillborn.
 
 
So, but it got dark.
 
It got evening.
 
So  J a
nciasaid why don't you stay here because it's 
dangerous to walk and then we'll see what we will do.
 
So we stayed thereovernight.
 
In  th e 
m orning, this was August
 
4, 1942.
 
Thenextm orning her husband com esf rom  his work.
 
He  
was on the night shif t workin g.
 
And he says,Oh,m y gosh what areyou doing here
; d
on't you 
know what's going on in Drohobycz?
 
Of  course we didn't know anything.
 
T here was no 
telephones.
 
T here was no radio.
 
There was nothing.
 
T he Germ ans conf iscatedthe radios, 
telephones, and all of  th
at thing.
 
He says if  they would com ehereand see you here, they 
would kill you and they would kill us, all of us.
 
So he says you bettergo andhide som ewhere 
outside.
 
 
So he gave
 
--
 
he or Jancia gave m y m other a pieceof bread and told us that behind 
the 
road there is a wheatfield.
 
And behind that there was some trees gro wing.
 
So  
they said go 
thereand try to hide there.
 
So we lef t thehouse, crossed the street,went through the wheat 
f ield.
 
My m other hadaraincoat, the colorof  wheat.
 
She found an 
indentation in the ground.
 
So  

6 
 
she says we'll lie down  thereand cover with the coatand see whathappens, try to survi ve.
 
So  
we did so. 
 
 
And t
h en
 
soonaf terthat we started hearing dogs barking, Germansscream ing, 
" Raus, raus."
 
"S c h ne ll!. "
 
W hen I hear the
se words, you know, it's terrible.
 
And then it was 
shooting
 a
ndpeople scream ing of pain.
 
It lasted m aybe 15 m inutes.
 
Then it got quietfor 
another 10 or15m inutes and startedall over again.
 
And it lasted like until about5:00
 
o r 
6:00
 
in the evening.
 
>> 
Bill Benson:
 
And this is when the Germ an aktion
 
--
 
>> Ma rc e l D ri m e r:
 
One of  theaktions by theGerm ans.
 
T h i s  wa s  one  of t h e bigge s t .
 
So at 
about 5:00
 
or 6:00
 
in the evening it quieted m uch, likefor good sowe got up and we started 
walkin g towards Jancia's
 
house.
 
As we came tothe road, there was a Germ an soldier.
 
I do n 't 
know if  he was SS.
 
Anywa y, he was a uniform ed soldier
 w
ith adog, standing on the street on 
the right side.
 
He looked atus.
 
W e lo o k ed  at  hi m .
 
It seem ed like it was forever buthe just 
tu r
ned aroundand walked away.
 
 
W e wonderedm any tim es why he did it.
 
T he Germans, when theywent huntingfor 
Jews, they would alwa ys go in pairs or m ore thantwo because theirphilosophy was that if  
som ebody sees som ething and it's not hisbusiness, he could
 
turn aroundand walk awa y.
 
B u t 
if  there was two
 
--
 
so there was no chance for the soldier orfor theSS mento let the person 
live .
 
But he was alone, lucky m e,for whatever reason.
 
 S
o we walked over the street and cam eto Jancia and stayed overnight the
re again.
 
T he next day
 
--
 
excuse m e.
 
My f a th e r c ame
 
--
 
m y father stayed in adorm itory at the lumber 
factory where he worked.
 
T here was a dorm itory where Jewish m enlived who didn't have 
f a m ilie s .
 
Those that have f am ilies would go hom e but during aktionthey would stay there.
 
So f ather came and took us hom e.
 
W e walked tothe hom e and came toour apartm ent and 
opened the door
 
--
 
actually, the door was open.
 
T here weref eathers f lying all over the place.
 
Furniture were dam aged.
 
T he apartm ent was empty.
 
They were all taken.
 
All m y aunt and 
cousins and m y grandparents.
 
T hey were keptf ortwo or threedays in um shatz platz wher e 
they keptpeopleuntil they got enough of them , withoutfood, without sanitary f acilities.
 
A n d 
then they were taken to 
Belzec
 
a nd  k ille d
 
there.
 
 
Belzec was one of theworst one of the cam ps.
 
I t  wa s  a  k illin g c a mp.
 
There were 
concentration cam psand killing camps.
 
Auschwit z was concentration cam p.
 
They would use 
people to work, as long as they could work
,  
on m inim al rations.
 
And then they 
would bring 
otherpeopleand kill those people.
 
T he  on e
s 
that went to Belzec, they were killed im mediately.
 
Som y grandparents, aunt,and cousin were killed.
 
 
Af ter the war, we f ound out that whenthe Germ ans were passing
 
--
 
well, the Germans 
usually had h
elpf rom the Ukrainian police orPolish police.
 
So som ebody toldus that when 
they passed, when the Germans came through, they passed ourapartm ent.
 
It was hiddenf rom  
the road.
 
There was a10 or12
-
year
-
old boy that ran after them  andsaid there are Jews 
liv i n g 
over there, youm issed that house.
 
Sothe Germ ans came back andtookeverybody.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Marcel, soon after you lost your grandparentsand otherf am ily m embers, like 
you described, soonafter that, in thef all of 1942, that's when the Germ ans
 
created a ghetto in 
Drohobycz and you were forced into the ghetto.
 
T ell us whatthatm eant to go into the ghetto 
and what conditions were likef or youthen.
 
>> Ma rc e l D ri m e r:
 
If you think that
 
--
 
if  it's bad and you think it can't be any worse, that's not
 
true.
 
In our case any stepforward was worse than the previous step.
 
The ghetto, four of  us 
lived in one room in the ghetto.
 
T here was no furniture.
 
T here was only a m attress that we 

7 
 
used.
 
Bread,food was im possible to get.
 
T hesanitary conditions were te
rri b l e .
 
A n d t he y 
continued their aktions.
 
There wouldbeanaktion and we would hide.
 
W eh ad  s om e p r i m i tive 
hide willing places 
--
 
hiding places we would hideandthen come out.
 
 
So it couldn't last very l ong becausethe Germans took
 
--
 
they had certain quotas of  
people thatthey had to deport to concentration cam ps.
 
Som y father decided that the time is 
right to get out of the ghetto.
 
He bribed
 
--
 
well , when the Jewish wor kers f rom the ghetto went 
to the places where they worked
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
So your
 
father still had his job in the lum berfactory.
 
>> Ma rc e l D ri m e r:
 
He was slave labor.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Right, slave labor in the lum ber buthe was still ableto do that.
 
>> Ma rc e l D ri m e r:
 
Rig h t .
 
T hey wouldn't let him  work in anoff ice.
 
He had tobuilda li
ttle , like , 
dog house or something where he workedbut hehad the job.
 
 
So apolicem an wouldcom e tothe ghetto ina certainplace.
 
T he Jews would getting 
to the andthe policemen would guidethem to the places where they work.
 
So m y father bribed 
the poli
c em a n.
 
My m other put som e men's clothing.
 
She tookm y sister under her arm and m y 
father took me underhis arm.
 
W e were not obese.
 
Obviously we we re thin like sticks.
 
S o  m y 
father took me andm y m other
 
--
 
and we went m arching with the group.
 
And then when 
we  
were near the lum berfactory, we got out of the group andfather putus behind afew bushes.
  
 
He prepared
 
--
 
in defense, he prepared, loosened part of the fence so that we could 
get throughand saidto m e, " I can't take you all together.
 
I will t a k e  mo
therand Irene and then 
I will com e and take you." W ell,I was 8 years old.
 
He says " You're am an so you have to stay."
 
So he tookm y m otherand m y sister.
 
I got scared.
 
I heard in the ghettothat people would 
abandon children and try to save their lives.
 
I just didn't
 
--
 
I was scared.
 
I was a child.
 
So I ran 
out 
and started screaming, " Daddy, D
addy!"
 
And, of  course, another policeman showed up.
 
So  
m y f atherhad to bribe that other policem an.
 
He would takethings out of his body and give  to 
these policem en.
 
 
Butm y father prepared that place to hide us in thatfactory.
 
There was abig building 
that was drying woodfor furniture and whatever was necessary.
 
So there was anattic there.
 
W ehad to wait in theplace wheref ather worked,until night.
 
A nd  t hen  a t n
ight we went there.
 
In the attic of that building f atherprepareda placef orus.
 
T here was no stairs or nothing.
 
W e 
would get there, a ladder, and stay.
 
But every day father
 
--
 
at m idnight, father would come and 
bring som e food.
 
W e wouldputthe string down and pull it up and put down the waste.
 
A nd  
father would come at night.
 
W e woulddo itfor, I don't know, a weekor something.
 
 
T hen there was af riend of m yf ather, a lady, told m yf ather that there is another 
wom an
, h
er name was Theresca
, t
hat she suspected thatm y fatherhad somebody in the 
cam p and she will m ake sure that she's right and she will do the right thing.T he right thing in 
her opinion was to report us to the SS and she would get a kilosof f lour or a kilos sugarf or 

eachperson that they report to SS.
 
So theother wom an told my father.
 
 
My f ather said, you know
 
--
 
he got ver y panicky, what todo, whattodo. 
 
He had a 
f riend who was a doctor.
 
T here was a little clinic in that place.
 
So hegot together with the 
doctor who was educated in Vienna,a perf ect German
 
--
 b
ecause Drohobycz, bef ore World 
W a r I I
 
--
 
W orl d W ar I, wa s  A u s t ra
-
Hungary.
 
W henm y parents wer e born
,  
i t  wa s 
A u s t ra
-
Hungary
. W
hen I was born it was Poland
. A
ndnow it's Ukraine.
 
 
So he was educated in Germany and he got an idea.
 
He  sa id , I  will writ e  a n  
anonym ous letter to the SSand tell them  that I had a sexual encounter with that woman and 

she gave m e syphilis.
 
And Germans were very touchy aboutthat thing.
 
Because their soldiers 

8 
 
had to be clean.
 
Anyway so next day, two SS m en cam e and picked up thisT heresca and 
brought her to the clinic where this doctor was.
 
So, of  course, he conf irmed that she had 
s yp h ilis .
 
So shedisappeareduntil theend of the war.
 
Then she came out andm y father told 
her what made her go.
 
Maybe it was th
e best thing f or her. 
 
>>
 
[Laughter]
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
From there, clearly, Marcel, you can't continue staying there.
 
So your father's 
got to now go f ind another placef or you.
 
I know our tim e is getting short but we want
 
--
 
>> Ma rc e l D ri m e r:
 
I have to.
 
I  ha
ve to.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Absolutely.
 
>> Ma rc e l D ri m e r:
 
Som y f ather wentto the villages nearby, especially the vil lage where my 
m other was born, nearby, near Drohobycz, and contacted several people.
 
T hey didn't want to 
help.
 
Som eof  them  threatened him  that
 
they'll report him  and ask togi ve the ring or 
som ething.
 
 
W ell, anywa y, onef amily, Sa winski f am ily, decided to
 
--
 
m yf ather prom ised them a lot 
of  things, but they wer e very decent people.
 
S o  Mrs .
 
Sawinski decided
 
--
 
told m y f ather that 
she would takem y m other andm y sister.
 
Thereasonfor that is that in Poland, only Jewish 
m en were circum cised.
 
So when theGermans would find under the circum stances 
--
 
would 
f indm eat thathouseand they would realize that I am  Jewish, everybody would be killed.
 
 
So  m
y f ather'sphilosophy was save anybody that you can save.
 
So a f ew days later, 
we cam e down and we stayed in thedining room , where the workers  ate.
 
A nd  Mrs .
 
S a win s k i 
cam e there to take us.
 
Of course, I was crying and m y mother was cr ying.
 
A n d  Mrs .
 
Sawinsk
i 
started to cry.
 A
nd then atone point she says,W
ell,  wh a te ve r will b e ,  will b e
; 
I  will t a k e  t h e 
boy, too. 
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
So you said to me this is your
 
m other's version of " Sophie's C
hoice."
 
Save her 
daughterbut not you.
 
>> Ma rc e l D ri m e r:
 
I don't know if she would go by herself and I don't want to know.
 
B u t  lu c kily 
Mrs .
 S a win ski 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
I'll ta ke Ma rce l, too .
 
>> Ma rc e l D ri m e r:
 
Sowe went to the 
v
illage where they worked.
 
T h i s  wa s
 
--
 
we stayed with the 
f a m ily,  wit h  t h e  Sa win s k i f a m ily.
 
The rationing was still in power.
 
And thefarmers could not 
slaughter any pigs or chickensor any anim als without notif ying the Germans.
 
So if  they would 
go andbuy m ore
f
ood on the black m arket, it would be suspicious.
 
 
Oh, by the way.
 
I have to hurry up.
 
She allowed us 
to  
com e and thenm y f ather came 
andthenm y uncle, if  was working at the
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
The refinery, right?
 
>> Ma rc e l D ri m e r:
 
Rig h t
, as abutcher
.  
So there was 13 of us.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
To m ake sure people understand
, t
h is  wa s  a  lit t le  
tiny f armhouse.
 
>> Ma rc e l D ri m e r:
 
Very poor.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Very poor, dirtf loors, very sm all.
 
And over tim e 13 people were hidden in 
there.
 
Did the Sawinski s have children, too?
 
>> Ma rc e l D ri m e r:
 
T hey hadf our children.
 
>> 
B ill B e n s o n
: 
So as m any as 19 
people.
 
W here were you hidden?
 
Obviously you had tobe 
hidden away.
 
>> Ma rc e l D ri m e r:
 
In  the  a ttic.
 
T here was a thatch roof , without a chim ney
. T h
e smoke would 
com e there.
 

9 
 
 
But bef ore m y uncle cam ethere, thefood
 
--
 
the youngest boy of the Sawinskis would
 
takea cart with a container and go to the ref inery where m y uncle was working as a butcher, 
andm y uncle would give som em eator bread or som ethingf or which he would be killed 

im mediately.
 
Andalsothe scrapsf rom  the table, the people ate.
 
W hen we
 
--
 w
hen he came 
back, we, the hiding Jews, had thef irst choice before they would get their part.
 
It wa s no t 
eating.
 
It was just survi ving.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And you had
 
--
 
there was a hole in the ground where som e were hidden, as 
you said.
 
Some were in the that
 
happenedattic where sm oke cam eup through.
 
And there was 
a little shedm aybe.
 
And you had to rotate som ehow, right?
 
>> Ma rc e l D ri m e r:
 
E xa c t l y.
 
Ye s .
 
Ye s .
W
e didnothave a chance to go out andplay.
 
My s i s t e r 
saw a chicken oncef rom  hiding f rom the roof and she says, "W hy can't Ibe the chicken?"
 
The 
chicken just runsaround andnobody bothers him and I have to stay here. W ebathed once a 

m onth.
 
There was lice, bed bugs.
 
It was just absolutely terrible conditions.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And you were therefor alm ost a year.
 
Righ t ?
 
>> Ma rc e l D ri m e r:
 
Rig h t .
 
T he Russian Arm y l iberated usonthe 5thof  August
 
1944.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Soalmost a year.
 
So you went throughthe winter.
 
>> Ma rc e l D ri m e r:
 
T hrough the winter and thef all.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And the winters are extrem ely tough.
 
Sohow did you survi ve the winter in 
there? 
 
>> Ma rc e l D ri m e r:
 
W e were close.
 
[Laughter] Physicall y close.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Righ t .
 
Righ t
.  
>> Ma rc e l D ri m e r:
 
I couldn't
 
--
 
m ostof  thetime I could not stand up.
 
I had to lie down.
 
I could 
not 
talk loud because som ebody could hear.
 
That's the way we lived and that's the way we 
survi ved.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
You shared with m e
 
--
 
I mean, of  course you couldnot do anything to bring 
attention to you, thef act that any of you were there.
 
And you couldn't get medical care.
 
Yo u  
hada very scar y tim ewith your sister, right? 
 
>> Ma rc e l D ri m e r:
 
S h e wa s so  sick.
 
She was bleeding.
 
W e worriedwhere would we bury h er 
so as not to m ake
 
--
 
get somebody to realize that we were there.
 
I did not see adentist for 
th r
ee years.
 
I didnot see a doctor.
 
It was a very, very tough, tough tim e.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Af ter a year.
 
And you can only gi ve us a glim pse of that here.
 
T ell us about 
your liberation.
 
How did that com e about? 
 
>> Ma rc e l D ri m e r:
 
W ell, the Soviet Arm y liberat
ed us, as I said, the 5th of  August.
 
W e heard
 
we were liberated.
 
W e were ecstatic.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
But before that,there were
 
bom bardments going on all around you.
 
>> Ma rc e l D ri m e r:
 
Rig h t .
 
T he allies camef rom  the
 
territories that they also had in Europe 
and 
they would bom b thefactories, the lumber
 
--
 
no,not lumber,butthe oil so thatthe Germ ans 
would not have oil.
 
Sothis was theonly tim e that we would com eout f rom hiding and stay 
therebecauseeverybody else was hiding.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
So everybody
 
else goes in their shelters and you could com eout while 
bombing was going on.
 
>> Ma rc e l D ri m e r:
 
Rig h t .
 
Righ t .
 
T he only tim e.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W hat di d  t h e R u s s ian
s d o
 
when they liberated you? 
 
>> Ma rc e l D ri m e r:
 
W ell, th e y w
e re
 
--
 
they m ade m yf ather the director of  thefactory where m y 
father worked, luckily.
 
A Russianoff icer comes once to m yf ather to order som e lumberfor the 
f r on t
 a
nd m y f ather was barefoot.
 
So the Russian off icer says, " Youare adirector of thefactory 

10
 
 
and youare baref oot.
 
How could
 
t h i s  be ?"
 
He says,"  Idon't have any m oney.
 
T here is nothing 
available."
 
 
He toldthem  what thesituation was.
 
W hen we got outf rom  the Sawinski's, it was in 
the same shirtsandpants that we cam e in.
 
So the Russian off icer gave m y f ather some 
m ilit a ry b
oots.
 
And then m yf ather asked how about
 
--
 
at that tim e Iwas 10 years old.
 
I have a 
10
-
year
-
old boy and he alsodoesn't have any shoes.
 
So I gotm ilitary shoes.
 
I ruinedm y feet 
with  th a t.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Marcel, that was August of 1944.
 
Of course, the war continued in Europe until 
April of  1945
 a
nd thearm ies were m oving onas they m oved westwa rd.
 
W ere you able 
to
 
--
 
you started to go to school.
 
T ell us what that was like for you.
 
>> Ma rc e l D ri m e r:
 
Rig h t .
 
T he children
 
--
 
I would be very quiet.
 
I would just sit quiet and not 
play with other children, talk very lo w, ver y qui etly.
 
So the teacher askedm y m other to come 
and she said,W hat'swrong with your son?
 
W hydoesn't he play wi th other children?
 
W h y 
doesn't he talk
, s c
ream , like children?
 
So my m otherexplained that this is what the reality was.
 
I couldn't walk.
 
My m uscles atrophied.
 
So I couldn't play with otherchildren.
 
 
So after the war, I tried to catchup.
 
I lostthree years of  schooling because I should 
have started at 7 and I started at 8.
 
I c a u
gh t  up  s om e .
 
But it was tough.
 
 
Andaf terthe Russians came, all the Jews got outof  thehiding and cam e tothe 
m iddle of  town.
 
T herewas about400 Jews left.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Out of about 17,000.
 
>> Ma rc e l D ri m e r:
 
Out of  17,000.
 
There weresom e more that c
am e f r o m  R u s s i a a nd s om e 
that were partisans, som e were in Polish Army and RussianArm y.
 
So all together about 700 
Jews sur vi ved outof 17,000 Jews.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Marcel, of  course, you lived under Comm unist rule until 1961, when youf inally 
m ade your way here.
  
 
I want to leave a little bit of  tim efor a couple of  questionsf rom  ouraudience, but 
bef ore we do that, youjust recently, this last year, you andAnia went back to Drohobycz, f irst 

t im e
 
--
 
you hadbeen to Polandbut you hadnever been to Drohobycz since 1945.
 
B rief ly
 
--
 
>> Ma rc e l D ri m e r:
 
1946.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Brief ly, what was that like to go back?
 
>> Ma rc e l D ri m e r:
 
It was absolutely am azing.
 
It was absolutely amazing.
 
W hat happened is 
the 
Sawinskis had
 
--
 
in addition to thesefourchildren that were there when we were, two 
daughtersthat were one was m arriedand one was sent to Germ anyfor slave labor.
 
I d idn 't 
realize.
 
I didn't know about it.
 
But a young lady, Maria, studied history in Dro
hobycz.
 
And she 
wanted to write a story of  herf am ily.
 
Somehow som ebody rem em bered that there was a young 
boy, Marcel
 
--
 
m y name was spelleddifferent.
 
So she started Googli ng and researching and 
found outoneof m y stories that I talked to inthe University of W estVirginia, the Holocaust 

Museum
,  
so she wrote a letter saying
 
--
 
telling us that she was the grand, grand, 
granddaughter of the Sawinskis and she was the onethat has the photos that we have here.
 
And I havem any m ore photos.
 
And she
 
invited us.
 
 
W e went with a groupof survivors f rom  Israel.
 
Only four were survi vors, m y sister and 
I and twof rom Israel.
 
And theothers were second generation, third generation.
 
But it wasan 
am azing trip.
 
Ihadthechance to put som ef lowers on Mrs.
 
S a win ski' s gra v
e.
 
She died in1957.
 
And I was with the whole f am ily.
 
Maria's grandf ather was one of thegrandchildrenof  the 
Sawinski's, the only one that rem em bered.
 
So we talked about it.
 
W e exchanged photos.
 
W e 

11
 
 
went to the places where thetrain tookpeople to theexterm ination cam p, to the places where 
people were killed inforests.
 
 
Oneplace wherem y uncle's wif e anddaughter were killed was in thef orest
, 
6, 0 00  
people in thatf orest were killed.
 
W e would gof rom  place to place and prayf or thedead.
 
And 
tell our 
sto rie s.  
T hose that rem em bered stories, we tell for the others.
 
They spoke Hebrew, 
m o s t  of  t h em .
 
But m y sister translated.
 
 
Oh, and I
 
--
 
Maria asked me to talk to her class to her student class.
 
I talked to her 
cla ss.  
I gave them
 
--
 
offer I can speakEnglish or Polish.
 
So in western Ukraine,Polish is quite 
popular.
 
T hey speak alot of Polish.
 
SoI talked Polishabout whatI am  telling to you except 
that it wasn't there, it was here.
 
T he ghetto was about two blocksf rom  where I was talking to 
t h em .
 
T he fore
st was about threem iles where people were killed.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
The Sawinski's hom e.
 
>> Ma rc e l D ri m e r:
 
T he hom e, was already in ruins
, a
 
new home.
 
W e tried to bring herhere for 
vacation and stay with her but visa did not work.
 
She spent
 
$150 f or the 
applicationof  the visa.
 
And they, in the Ukraine, they earn
 
--
 
she graduatedhistory the departm entand she was a 
teacher.
 
And she earns
 
$50 a m onth.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And the applicationf ee was threem onths' wages.
 
>> Ma rc e l D ri m e r:
 
T hree m onths' wages.
 T
hey didn't accept it.
 
Im ean, this was our people.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Marcel, I think we are at 12:00
 
so I think we're not going to have tim ef or 
questions f rom  the audience.
 
But, when Marcelf inishes, because we've not quiteheard the 
last f rom  Marcel, he's 
going to rem ain here on the stage.
 
So we invite you, any of  you, allof  
you, believe it or not,to com eupon stage and meet Marcel, shakehis hand, get your picture 

taken with him , whatever you want to do,or ask him a question.
 
Pleasefeelf ree to do tha
t.
 
 
I want to thank all of you for being with us.
 
I rem ind you we'll have a
 
F i rs t  P e rs on
 
program  eachW ednesday andThursday until them iddle of August.
 
So Ihope you can come 
b a c k  s om et i m e t hi s  yea r .
 
But if  not,next year.
 
You canf ind inf orm ation andtra
n scrip t s fro m 
our program sand podcasts on our website.
 
So you can see otherprogram s as well as this 
one.
 
 
It's our tradition at
 
F i rs t P e rs o n
 
that our First Person gets the last word.
 
So I'm  going to 
turn now to Marcel to close usout.
 
>> Ma rc e l D ri m e r:
 L
ast word.
 
I am talking to you and others who want to listentom ebecause 
thereare people andorganizations who claim  that the Holocaust isa hoax, that itnever 

happened,that the Jews m ade itup to getmoneyf rom the Germ ans.
 
I am a witness that it did 
happen.
 
By listening to the stories ofm y childhood, you becom e witnessesalso.
 
 
Our goodf riend, the
 
--
 
said that we all have to f ightthef our evil 
Is
:  i
ntolerance, 
injustice, ignorance, and indifference.
 
T heseare the rootsof  m en's moral corruptions th
a t 
allowed Hitler andhis helpers to com e topower and torture andmurder m illions of people he 

considered underpeople, not worth living, not only Jews but peoplewith disabilities, gypsie s, 

homosexuals,and many other groups.
 
Changing these behaviors is thepath to preventing 
Holocausts and genocides.
 
Andthis is what this Holocaust Museum is all about.
 
 
About indifference, I would liketo read this short statement here.
 
T h is  wa s  
Pastor 
Martin Niem oller when he was liberatedf rom Dachau.
 
 ﬁ
Fi
rst they cam e
 
for the socialist
 
andI did not speak out because I was not a socialist.
 
T hen they cam efor the trade unionistand Idid not speak out because I was not a trade 

unionist.
 
T hen they cam efor the Jews and Idid not speakoutbecause I was not a Jew.
 
Then 
th
ey camef orm e and there was noone lef t to speakf orm e.

So there is something to think about.
