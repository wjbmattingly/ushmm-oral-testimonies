Abstract
Theodore

His

but,
before

that
he
wanted

to
see
if
he
could

after
the

He

[UNRRA]
and
was

Why

tel l
me
a
li ttle
bit
about
your
family
and
personal
background;
reconstruct
it?
Theodore
:
 
Let
me
start
in
th e
place
called
Stolbtsy
[Stowb tsy],
S
r
t
r
o
r
l
r
b
r
t
r
s
r
y,
formerly
White
Russia,
now
Be
l
arus,
where
a
family
was
growing
up.
The
fa mily
ha d
a
hotel,
which
was

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0335  
2 
 
  
 
 
used
as
a
wa y
station
for
Jews
going
to
Palestine.
Th is
was
a
tens e
ce ntury .
My
two
sisters,
not
my
mother,
she
was
a
very
strong
r
willed
person,
were
influenced
by
a
man
called
Zalman
Sha zar,
who
later
was
pr esident
of
Isr a el.
With
th e
pogroms
in
that
area,
they
moved
to
Milwaukee,
Wisconsin,
an
d
there
th
e
family
had
a
delicatessen,
a
grocery.
Th e
two
daug hter s
went
to
gra mmar
school
and
hi gh
s chool.
And
in
college,
one
of
my
sisters,
Sara,
Sara
Feder,
beca me
frie ndly
with
a
woman
by
th e
na me
of
Golda
Meyerso n
 
I
have
a
pictur e
to
prove
it
who
later
bec
ame
Golda
Meir.
And
th ere
are
pictures
somewhere
in
my
archives
abo ut
Golda
taki ng
me
to
kindergarten.
Now,
it
isn't
that
I
was
infl uenced
by
Golda
at
that
age,
but
I
was
in
a
grou ping
where,
as
a
youngster,
I
was
sort
of
pulled
in.
And
that
was
in
Milwaukee.
Th
ere
was
a
Polish
Zionist
group,
heade
d,
of
course,
by
Go l d a
and
my
sis ter.
And
so
I
can' t
say
that
in
my
mother's
mil k
I
was
given
Zionism,
but
I
cer tainly
gr e w
up
with
it
and
I
had
a
gre a t
love
for
my
sister
Sara.
I
followed
her
around
like
a
li
ttle
dog.
And
slowly,
all
of
th is
began
to
come
to
a
poi nt.
Now
Go l da,
after
Wor ld
War
I,
de ci ded
to
go
to
Palestine.
Sh e
told
her
husband,
"I' m
goin g.
Do
you
want
to
come?
Do.
If
not,
stay
her e."
He
went.
When
it
came
to
my
sister,
she
said
the
same
thi
ng
to
her
hus
band,
and
then
stopped.
And
so
my
sister
did n™t
go
to
Pale stine,
but
wa s
one
of
the
f o unders
of
the
Pioneer
Wo men
Organization
in
the
Uni ted
States,
where
for
close
to
25
years
she
was
one
of
th e
leaders.
Thro ughout
all
thi s
period
and
also
during
th
e
war,
when
I
was
in
Fort
Knox,
anyone
who
r eally
wanted
to
know
kne w
what
was
h a ppenin g
in
Europe.
The
Jewish
Telegraphic
Agency
had
all
kinds
of
information,
speakers
comi ng
to
the
Louisville
YMHA
because
I
wa s
at
Fort
Knox,
which
was
near
Louisville,
and
as
a
warrant
officer
adjutant
I
also
read
documen
t
s
that
had
informati o n,
not
too
much,
about
th e
struggles
that
were
going
on
in
Europe,
mainl y
from
a
military
point
of
view.
All
of
thi s
deci ded
me
that
what
I
really
wanted
to
do
for
my
lif e
was
to
go
overseas,
when
it
was
over,
and
see
if
I
could
be
helpful.
Interviewer
:
What
year
are
you
tal
king
about
when
you
got
 
started
ge tti ng
i nf o rmation
abo ut
the
Jewish
situation?
Theodore
:
 
This
was
after
the
war
started,
1941.
I
was
at
Fort
Knox
from
194 1,
and
I
ende d
my
stay
there
on
a
day
that
a
do
cu ment
ca
me
through
from
General
Mars hall,
and
I
ev en
have
a
copy
of
it,
in
which
th e
Un ited
Nations
Relief
and
Re habilitation
Administration
[UNRRA]
was
asking
fo r
staff
to
be
a llowed
to
leave
the
army
and
come
overseas
and
work
for
th e
Unit ed
Natio ns.
I
immedi ately
put
in.
Maybe
one
of
the
reasons
that
I
was
able
to
get
in
was
that
I
had
had
a
small
association
with
the
Un
ited
Nations
at
Fort
Knox
when
one
day
we
were
asked
to
pick
30
drivers
about
the
same
age,
same
he ight,
and
I
di d
it.
And
there
were
commenda tions
from
the
commandin
g
gen
eral
about
how
well
we
did
it.
And
when
I
put
in
my
appli cation
to
the
UN RRA,
I
put
that
in
as
well.
And
I
think
that
may
have
tip ped
it,
when
I
came
overseas
with
the
U NRRA,
and
th at
was
a
saga
too,
because
it
was
on
a
ship
with
400
peopl
e
tha t
ha d
lef t
the
army
to
go
into
Europ e
with
the
UN RR A,
and
we
left
on
the
day
that
the
atom
bo mb
was
dropped.
So
ever ybody
on
that
ship
was
unha ppy
because
they
wo uld
have
bee n
discharged
if
they
stayed,
but
they
went
along.
We
lande d
in
En
gland,
and
something
ha
ppen ed
there
that
wa s
important,
as
far
as
my
kn owledge
of
what
was
hap p ening
in
Euro pe.
At
th e
headquarters
of
the
UN,
the
UNRRA
in
Washington,
they
were
very
adamant
that
we,
as
memb ers
of
the
Armed
Forces,
and
the
UN,
should
not
get
involve d
in
th e
bla
ck
marke
t.

Don't
take
hard
currency,
take
traveler's
che cks.
You
can' t
ge t
into
the
black
mar ket.
I
though t
it
str a nge
that
tha t
was
something
that
was
being
talk ed
about.
When
in
London,
I
nee ded
some
po unds.
Th e
only
place
I
coul d
go
to
was
the
US
Ar my
F inance
Office.
When
I
got
there,
I
saw
a
long
li
ne
of
300
or
40
0
men,
officers,
G.I™s.
I
got
in
line.
We
I
was
dressed
in
an
officer's
uniform,
with
a
tab
on
my
sho ulder
saying
UN RRA.
None
of
them
had
ever
s een
anything
like
that,
so
I
was
a
curiosit y.
And
after
I
answered
their
questions,
I
asked
the
m
questions.
I
said,
"Wha t
are
you
doing
waiting
in
line?"
At
which
poin t,
a
fellow
pu t
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
pulled
out
a
stack
of,
I
don't
know
how
many
ten s
of
thousand s
of
French
fr ancs.
He
says,
"I'm
going
to
chang e
these
Fren ch
francs
into
dollars,
and
I
will
have
ma
de
$25,000."
I
was
startled.
And
sure
enough,
all
th ese
me n
wer e
brin ging
money
in.
W hatever
they
sold,
I
didn 't
ask,
whether
it
was
Army
stuff
or
whatever,
cigare ttes
in
the
PX.
But
when
I
got
to
the
front
of
the
line,
I
threw
my
$10
0
in
traveler's
che cks,
the
f ellow
ther e
says,
"What
do
you
want
to
com e
to
me
for?
You're
going
to
get
legal
ri ght.
You
go
a r ound
the
corner
and
you'll
get
30
perce nt
more ."
Now,
I
tell
the
story
be cause
this
ele ment
was
very
important
in
war
r
torn
Eur o pe.
Wh
en
I
finally
got
to
Germany
and
I
was
in
the
headquarters
of
the
Unit
e d
Nations
Re habilitation
Relief
Adminis tration,
and
I
was
involved
in
documentation
and
statistics
and
so
on,
I
felt
very
uneasy.
I
felt
very
uneasy
because
I
saw
many
thi ng s
that
were
h a ppenin g
tha t
were
cer tai nly
not
some thing
I
wanted
to
be
associated
wi
t
h.
Na mely,
the
UN RR A
took
on
as
ref ugees,
ex
r
Wehrmacht,
even
some
of
the
soldiers
who
had
bee n
SS,
and
it
was
a
very
curi ous
mix.
And
in
addition,
the y
were
re patr iating.
The
Russians
came
in
and
took
their
Russians.
The
Poles
came
in
and
took
their
Poles.
Th
e
only
group
not
touched
was
the
Jews.
And
that
was
of
great
interest
to
me .
And
I
 
on
the
side,
I
kept
statistics
separately
to
see
just
what
it
was.
And
I
was
always
talking
to
Herb
Katzki,
whom
you
have
bee n
talking
with.
And
i ncidentally,
I
got
my
job
Her
b
doesn
't
agree
 
bu t
there
were
two
of
th em,
Harry
Beal
and
Herb
Katzki
I
had
a
hot
water
heater
in
my
buil ding
in
Elsen
[villa ge
in
the
city
of
Paderborn],
Ger many
where
the
hea dquarters
of
the
UN RR A
was,
and
th ey
didn't.
So
they
took
baths
in
my
place
and
tha
t's
how
I
got
in
th e
JDC.
Within
six
months
I
de cide d
I
wanted
to
get
out.
And
I
came
to
the
JDC,
and
th ey
said,
yes,
the y 'll
ta ke
you.
We
need
people
in
Muni ch
[Münch en] .
And
I
left
and
ca me
on
staff
with
the
JDC
in
Muni ch
[Mü
nch
en].
Interviewer
:
 
Let™s
backtra ck
a
bit,
now
that
you
talk ed
about
the
JDC.
Did
you,
with
th e
UN RRA,
did
you
have
a
specific
role
or
responsibility ,
and
was
that
based
on
training
you
ha d
had
before,
education
tha t
yo u
had
had
be fore?
Theodore
:
 
What
was
important
for
th e
UNRR
A
at
that
ti
me
was
to
have
a
cad r e
of
people
who
knew
the
Ar my,
be cause
the
UN RR A
was
under
the
aegis
of
th e
Army,
and
you
had
to
talk
militarize ,
old
bu ddy
sort
of
thi ng,
and
that's
why
I
was
in
the
U.S.
zone .
Also,
the
fact
that
I
ha d
a
major
in
p
s
ychology
and
pu blic
administration
gav e
me
a
ba ckg r ound,
certainly
not
my
Jewish
ba ckgroun d,
for
the
work
tha t
they
did
and
th e
fact
tha t
they
put
me
in
the
headquarters
of
the
entir e
UNRRA,
who
at
that
poi n t
had
close
to
seven
million
ref ugees.
However,
there
were
only
about
4
0,000
to
60,000
Jews,
only
40,000
to
60,000
Je ws
in
West
Germany,
Italy,
and
Austria,
very
few.

At
that
time .

Theodore
:
 
At
that
ti me.
 
Interviewer
:
 
What
was
the
nature
of
your
work
there?
Theodore
:
 
Actually,
it
was
called
reports
and
statistics
for
the
CEO,
which
me ant
that
we
had
to
keep
our
pulse
on
the
vast
movemen t
of
people
in
Eu rope
at
that
time.
Who
were
all
these
people
that
we
r
e
moving?
Trains
were
com ing
daily
into
West
Ger many
fr om
Romania,
Poland,
and
Czechoslovakia,
dumpi ng
the
"Volksdeu tsch".
Those
were
ci tize ns
who
had
a
German
ba ckgr ound
and
who
certainly
during
the
war
didn't
give
much
hel p
to
the
govern ment
that
wa s
supposedly
theirs,
and
th ey
were
all
thrown
out.
And,
of
course,
as
it
turned
out,
th
at
was
a
very
plus
for
West
Ger
many
be cause
the
pe ople
th ey
were
sendi ng
were
highly
skilled
farmers,
people
that
later
hel ped
Germany
in
their
rise
to
power
e co nomically.
But
we
were
in
constan t
con s ultation
with
many
areas
apprehen din g
peopl e.
Th e
tru th
of
the
matter
is
the
data
that
we
got
was
way
off,
way
off,
because
there
wer
e
more
people
get
ting
on
th e s e
trains
than
were
on
th e
books,
so
to
speak.
And
I
recall
now,
my
interest
in
JDC
and
the
fact
tha t
there
were
involved
in
all
of
this,
Jew ish
Army
cha pl a ins,
G.I™s.
As
a
matter
of
fac
t
,
when
I
ca me
to
Germany,
I
was
housed
in
a
town
near
Fra nkfurt
calle d
Hochst
[Hoch s t
am
Main],
which
you've
heard
of
Bayer's
Aspirin.
Well,
it
wa s
a
trem endo us
compl ex
for
manufactu ring,
at
that
ti me,
of
medi cation
for
venereal
disease.
And
when
 
there
was
one
eve
ning,
a
G.
I.
ca me
up
to
me
and
he
says,
"I
know
you're
Jewish."
I
said,
"Tha nk
you."
He
said,
"Would
you
help
us?"
I
said,
"What
is
it
I'm
supposed
to
do?"
He
said,
"Well,
we're
trying
to
hel p
Jews.
We're
trying
to
help
Jewish
refugees
come
in
from
th
e
East.
 "
So
I
said,
"Well,
how
are
they
comin g? "
And
he
told
a
story
of
all
this
grea t
mo vement
of
pe ople,
hun dre ds
of
thousands,
th at
th ere
was
an
un dergrou nd,
moving
people
out
of
Eastern
Euro pe,
staffed
by
what
was
calle d
the
Brikha,
w hich
were
Palestinian
Jews ,
it
was
a
brigade
stationed
in
It
aly.
And
what
Palestine
did
what
th e
Jewish
agency
did
was
to
draw
out
of
the
ranks
from
the
briga de
and
establ ish
this
organ ization
and
br ing
from
Palestine
others
to
replace
them
in
the
bri gade,
so
that
the
Bri tish
Army
di d n 't
know
that
ther e
had
be en
a
movement.
So
there
were
doz
e
ns
and
do zens
of
these
Palestinian
Jews,
all
picke d
for
what
it
was
th ey
had
to
do.
And
with
all
the
trains
comi ng
in,
th ere
would
be
additional
box
cars
added
at
th e
end
with
Jews
in
it,
Jews
who
wanted
to
flee
Ea stern
Europe.
And
it
was
espe
ci ally
in
rows
after
the
Kielce
pogrom,
do zens
of
Jews
in
Poland
were
shot,
th e
exodus
started.
And
so
this
young
ma n
said,
"Look,
we're
going
to
have
to
pick
up
so me
people
who
are
com in g
in
and
they 're
at
a
rail
center
outside
of
Frankfurt.
We're
going
to
have
a
tru
ck
and
we're
goi
ng
to
go
get
them."
I
said,
"I
can
go
along."
And
that
eve ning
we
got
in
the
truck ;
there
were
three
tr ucks.
And
we
drove
to
this
area,
and
we
stopped
in
front
of
a
b unker.
It
loo ked
li ke
a
bu nker.
He
says–
actually
the
top
was
all
bo
mbed
be
caus e
it
was
a
railroad
station.
He
says,
"I n
this
bunk er
we're
going
to
find
Jews.
On
th e
other
hand,
there
are
going
to
be
many
non
r
Jews
there."
I
said,
"W ell,
how
do
I
tell
the
difference?"
"O h,"
he
says,
"you
say
two
words.
You
say
'Join
t'
and
you
say
'Am
k hah'
w hich
is
Hebrew
for
fr iend. "
And
we
walked
down
about
twen t y
stairs
into
this
bun ker
and
it
was
a
tre mendous
area
filled
with
people.
It
was
di mly
lit
and
you
cou ld
hardly
tell,
childre n
wer e
cryin g.
You
could
hardly
move
through
th e
people,
and
both
of
us
started
from
both
sides
and
sa
y
ing
"Amk hah,
Joi nt."
And
it
was
as
if
the
words
were
ma gnets
and
the
people
were
made

out
of
steel.
Slowly
they
got
up,
didn 't
ask
a
ques tion,
and
follow ed
us
out.
I
was
so
overwhelme d
by
those
tw o
words
and
the
experience;
I
wa nted
more
than
ever
to
ge t
into
JDC.
And
eventually,
I
did .
Interviewer
:
 
That's
qui te
a
story.
You
started
to
talk
about
this
mass
movement
of
people
across
Europe,
and
you
m
e
ntioned,
at
least
some
of
them
were.
Can
yo u
expand
on
that
a
little
bit?
Theodore
:
 
When
our
pe ople
were
freed
from
the
camp,
th eir
fir s t
impulse
wa s
return
hom e.
And
it
wasn't
difficult
be cause
trains
were
moving.
Th e y
got
a
ride,
ju
st
like
my
wife,
and
she
was
in
a
grou p
who
were
walking
towards
Dresden,
and
when
th e
war
was
over
she
also
decid ed
to
go
home.
So
you
had
te ns
of
thousands
of
Jews
moving
back
home.
But
when
they
go t
there,
there
wasn't
mu ch .
The
homes
were
bom be d.
None
of
th
eir
friends
were
back.
Interviewer
:
 
You're
talking
about
th e
movemen t
of
people
across
Europe
in
1 945.
And
I'm
trying
to
get
a
sense
of
who
those
people
were.

Theodore
:
First
of
all,
yo u
must
re me mber
that
th e
Germans
had
take n
hundreds
of
thou sands
of
people
as
slave
laborers.
They
we
r
en't
Jews.
They
were
just
crim i nal
no,
I
sh ouldn't
say.
Th ere
were
a
few
cri minals.
They
just
took
anybody.
Or
the y
took
certain
skills,
and
pi cke d
th em
up
and
put
the m
to
work,
Hungaria n
farmers,
Ro manian
tailors.
They
had
the
best
system
of
be i ng
able
to
move
people
about
for
their
purposes.
An
d
they
moved
them.
And
they
used
them.
Sch indler's,
after
all,
those
pe ople
in
there.
So
you
had
those
th at
were
movi ng
westwar d
to
the i r
hom es,
and,
from
among
those
in
Germany,
the y
were
going
eastward
back
to
their
cou ntries.
But
le t
me
ge t
to
our
people.
Because
of
this,
bec
au
se
there
was
no
contr o l,
because
the
poli ce
and
the
military
could n't
care
less
if
another
trai n
Jews
were
able
to
com e
out
easily
into
Western
Ger many.
Why
Western
Ger many?
Because
th ere
were
th e
ca mps.
There
were
a
lot
of
camps
that
had
bee n
set
up
and,
i nde ed ,
were
beg
i
nning
to
close
down
because
of
th e
moveme nt,
the
repatria tion
of
hu ndre ds
of
thousan ds
of
people .
Interviewer
:
 
You're
talking
about
a
displ a ced
person's
cam p?
Theodore
:
 
Yeah.
We
ha d,
even
in
the
early
days
of
my
UN RRA
experien ce,
pe ople
responsible
didn't
und erstand
what
wa s
happen ing.
They
did n't
u nderstand
th at
th
ere
was
a
movemen
t
ta king
place
that
th ey
had
no
control
over,
because
and,
also,
because
of
the
fri endly
officers
of
the
UN RRA
who
wanted
to
be
helpf ul,
espe cially
becaus e
th e
comman ding
general
was
Eisenhower,
and
he
ha d
seen
how
unha ppy
Preside n t
Tru man
was
when
we
complai ned
about
the
bad
accommod
a tions
that
Je
ws
had
in
Ger many
as
compared
to
what
the
Ger mans
had.
And
there
was
a
group
head ed
by
a
fello w
of
th e
name
of
Harrison
who
ca me
and
said
it's
tr ue.
The
gentil es
were
living
mu ch
better
than
the
Jew s
who
had
co me
out
of
the
concentra tion
ca mp.
So
we
were
able
to
bri
n
g
all
these
peo ple
in
them.
I'm
talking
about
the
Brikha.
So
that
th e
30,000,
slowly,
in
the
period
of
194 6,
and
1947,
and
1948,
rose
to
about
a
quarter
of
a
million.
Now ,
the
general
opinion
is
tha t
those
that
we
were
serving
had
all
been
in
cam
p
s,
had
come
without
anything,
and
wer e
sick.
They
neede d
nouri s hment,
it
was
true.
Those
who

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0335  
6 
 
  
 
 
had
be en
in
camp
neede d
that.
But
what
this
move ment
was
bri nging
was
altogether
different.
Yo u
were
ge ttin g
Jews
who
had
lived
in
th e
un dergroun d.
They
calle d
it
uboat
[?] .
Th ere
were
Jew s
who
were
in
th e
par tisan,
hun dreds
of
Jews.
Th ere
were
Jews
who
were
fleeing
fro m
Poland
and
Bucharest
an
d
H
 ungary.
And
then
the
last
group
and
the
most
important
group
were
Je ws
from
the
Soviet
Union.
Jews
who
deserted
th e
Russian
Army .
Jews
who
had
an
opportunity
of
leaving
and
they
took
it.
And
so,
there fore,
the
group
we
were
working
with
were
not
tho s e
who
coul d n't
take
care
of
thems
e
lves.
On
the
contrary,
tho s e
who
ca me
brought
strength
to
the
those
who
had
bee n
in
cam p.
For
exampl e,
we
de cide d
very
soon
it
could
very
well
have
been
that
they
decided
it
for
us
to
set
up
a
self
r
gov ernmen t.
Ma ny
of
the
Jew ish
army
chaplains
were
very
mu
ch
involved
in
th
at.
Now,
th e
chaplains
were
into
Ger m any
earlier
tha n
we
were.
We
did n't
come
in
until
the
middle
of
June.
They
were
ther e
before
th e
war
ende d.
And
some
of
th em
wer e
very
aggressive
and
saw
i mme diately
the
need
for
self
r
governm ent
and
a
self
r
governmen t
was
set
up
.
Th
 e
chairman
at
tha t
time
was
a
man
by
the
na me
of
Blumowitz
who
late r
beca me
the
Surgeon
Gen eral
of
the
Israeli
Ar my.
We're
ta lking
about
people
with
ca pacity.
There
was
a
man
by
the
name
of
Retter
who
later
becam e
an
aide
to
Golda
Meir.
A
Mr .
Piegoch
[?
]
bec
 ame
a
numb e r
two
person
in
the
Mapai
party.
So
we
were
dealing
with
people
who
were
responsible,
who
were
able
to
act,
who
did
what
we
couldn 't
do.
We
coul d
come
into
a
camp
and
we
had
our
peo ple
in
ca mps.
But
when
it
came
to
r unni ng
the
cam p,
they
were
running
it.
Th
ey
we
mus
t
forget
about
it
being
a
camp.
We
thou ght
of
it
as
a
village.
Ther e
was
a
mayo r.
There
was
a
police
force.
There
was
a
fire
force.
There
were
ki tchens.
There
was
garbage
colle ction.
They
were
all
Jews .
So
what
we
were
dealing
with,
really,
were
peop
le
who
we
re
responsible.
And
as
we
brough t
in
our
supplies
in
those
early
day s ,
the
division
was
made
di rectly
to
the
camp.
They
made
the
distribu tion.
They
were
our
armed
kni g hts.
Interviewer
:
Question,
jus t
for
the
reco rd,
who
are
we
talki ng
about
now
when
you
say
we?
Theodore
:
Talking
about
Joint
.

Interviewer
:
 
Okay.

Theodore
:
 
That
Joint .
And
so
there
is
another
ele ment.
For
example,
I
noti ced
in
the
documen t
the
Muse um
put
out
recently
about
the
history
after
the
war.
I
noticed
tha t
it
said
that
on
Ju ne
 
or
in
June,
the
JDC
was
admitted
in
order
to
set
up
a
we
lfare
program.
That
was
true,
but
it
didn 't
go
far
enough,
because
the
hi story
of
the
DP
camps
has
never
really
bee n
told.
How
to
come
to
grips
with
a
grou p
who
have
be en
through
the
Holocaust,
lost
the i r
famili es,
were
living
in,
the
best
I
coul
d
say,
in
substandard
housing
in
the
camps,
even
thoug h
some
of
the m
were
villages,
how
coul d
th ey
come
out
of
that
trauma?
What
how
coul d
th ey
get
up
every
day,
having
lost
their
families,
livi ng
in
these
wretched
conditions ?
Okay.
The y
were
given
food,
clothin g,
and
so
on.
It
was
mind
boggli
n
g
tha t
they
di d
so
well.
Fo r
example,
we
brough t
in
three
psy chiatrists
and
sent
them
to
the
largest
ca mp,
which
was
in
Pocking,
where
th ere
were
14,000
Jews
in
one
cam p.
And
we
broug ht
the m
over
for
a
purpose .
We
weren't
sure
wha t
di d
we
need
for
Palestine.
Wha
t
did
they
nee
d
in
order
to
care
for
the
possibility
of
large
r
scale
mental
break downs?
Because
after
all,
ther e
was
a
lot
we
knew
were
going
to

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0335  
7 
 
  
 
 
Palestine,
th e n
Israel.
Wha t
would
th ey
need?
Wha t
would
we
ne ed?
We
 
and
I'l l
get
to
our
progra m
in
a
mo me nt
 
and
after
a
month
the r e,
they
cam e
up
with
the
following.
Th ey
exa mined
about
400
pe ople.
And
th ey
cam e
to
th e
following
conclusion,
that
the
perce ntage
of
peo ple
who
would
break
down
or
who
would
ne
ed
hospitalizatio n
would
be
no
different
than
in
a
norm al
society.
That
was
it.
And
tha t
was
true.
We
had
a
few,
a
few
dozen
out
of
a
quarter
of
a
millio n
having
to
be
hospitalized,
but
the
majo rity
wouldn't.
Whether
it
was
because
of
the
st
rength
of
anyone
who
had
survived,
but
it
was
also
a
point
tha
t
we
came
to
the
con clusion
that
something
was
happeni ng .
It
wasn't
th at
we
were
talking
to
all
th e
people
or
it
wasn't
that
the
central
commi tte e,
which
was
our
group,
and
incide ntally ,
the
army
ga ve
the m
a
liaison
officer.
They
had
a
full
colonel
as
a
liaison
officer
from
Fra
n
kfurt
who
d i dn't
speak
a
word,
other
than
English,
and
so
we
wer e
very
good
friends.
Wha t
was
the
name?
Colonel
Sivers,
from
the
South .
And
sudde nl y
it
was
sudden
 
one
da y
we
said,
you
kno w ,
there 's
something
chan ging
compl
e
tely.
The
social
workers
be gan
to
talk
to
us
abo ut
the
paring
r
offs
that
wer e
taki ng
place
in
cam p,
lo oking
for
new
life.
The
result
was
something
that
we
will
never
forget.
At
one
point
 
w ell,
first
of
all,
we
brought
in
w eddin g
rings,
sent
a
jeep
down
to
Milan.
They
bough
t
wedding
rings.
Everybody
go t
a
free
wedding
ring.
Number
two
and
most
impor tant
was
that
we
said,
look,
we
be tter
get
as
man y
diapers
as
we
can
be cau s e
we're
going
to
be
full
and
ne ed
it.
And
I
recall
in
early
194 8,
we
had
a
 
someone
made
some
statistics.
They
said
that
every
woman
betw
een
th
e
ages
of
ei ghteen
and
thirty
was
either
pregnan t
or
had
had
a
child
in
th e
previous
six
m o nths.
This
r ebirth,
this
the
rose
growing
in
a
garbage
can,
people
who
looked
so
unfi t
were
changi ng.
And
so
th ere
was
a
miracle.
Th ere
were
the
childre
n.
And
with
childre n,
you
had
to
change
a
lot
of
programs.
We
had
do ctors,
and
never
mi nd
the
question
of
diapers,
spe cial
foods,
and
th e
whole
gamut.
And
th e
cam ps
change d
completely,
be cause
with
the
childre n,
wha t
else
did
th e y
need?
The
people
in
the
camps
to
have
a
village
.
Papers,
there
were
at
le ast
a
doze n
Jewish
papers
that
were
pu blish ed.
And
also,
the
 
ther e
was
no
Yiddish
typ e,
so
th e y
were
phone tically
English
words.
In
the
book
I
gave
you,
you'll
see.
Ki ndergarte ns,
new
thing.
They
opened
up
ki ndergarte ns.
We
wer e
inv o lved
in
a
very
famous
Jew ish
actor
by
the
na
me
of
Yabakoff
[?].
I
noti ced
it
in
th e
pa per
the
other
da y.
The
come dian,
we
brought
hi m
in.
We
broug ht
in
Yi ddish
 
th ere
was
one
pla ce
that
had
a
lot
of
Yi ddish
movies.
We
brought
tha t
in.
We
broug ht
in
all
kinds
of
athletic
stuff
for
th e
pe
ople.
Mo
st
important,
one
I
can 't
forget,
that
it
was
difficult
fo r
the
Army
to
und erstand
the
Jews.
After
all,
in
dealing
with
th e
mili tary
gov ernmen t,
dealing
with
the
Germans
who
were
clean,
pr ecise ,
and
work
on
tim e,
who
would
say,
"Ya h,"
every
tim e
th e
question
was
asked.
Our
people
never
sa
id
yah.
They
were
i nde p enden t.
And
it
was
hard
for
the
Army
to
und e r stand,
th ey
had
to
be
responsible,
but
they
could n't .
And
so
ther e
were
all
kinds
of
rumors
that
th e
Jews
were
la zy.
They
di dn 't
want
to
wo rk.
That
th ey
were
just
eati ng
 
doing
no thin g,
forgetti ng
forgetting
that
not
one
of
our
peopl
e
wanted
to
stay
there .
This
was
the
bloody
earth
of
Ger many.
And
they
were
ther e
by
suff erings.
And
the
minute
they
had
an
opportu nity
of
getting
out,
ille gally
or
legally,
they
went.
But
the
com mandin g
general
said,
look,
these
peop le
are
doi ng
n o thing.
So
we
set
up
a
work.
It
was
called
produk
tiveassersia
[?].
A
word
fo r
us.
We
brought
in
mater ial.
We
had
so
many
tailors.
Th e
ORT
expande d.
I
must
say
that
with
th e
tailors,
we
ha d
a
funny
experi ence
with
one
group
be cause
we
had
some
very
bri ght
people;
after
all
there
were
Je
ws
from
ód
Í
,
an
area
where
clot
hes
were
made .
And
so
we
found

you
figure
out
on
a
pie ce
of
material
you
can
mak e
so
many
suits,
different
sizes.
And
we
found,
much
to
our
dis may,
that
this
one
pla ce
was
making
only
small
sizes
and
keeping
the
rest
of
it,
maki ng
bi g
sizes
and
selli ng
it
for
the
com mi ttee
to
be
used
in
the
religious
activities.
But
we
thou
ght
that
was
fine.
So
we
pu
t
peo ple
to
work.
And
all
during
this
ti me
there
was
the
un dergro und
going
to
Palestine.
We
were
involved.
We
were
involve d.
The
nu mb er
of
gallons
of
gasoline
th at
somehow
or
other
went
out
of
certain
tru cks
to
other
tr ucks,
made
it
av
ailable
for
them
to
move
down
to
Italy
and
to
France.
And
there
was,
th e
UNRRA
kne w
about
it.
The
British
wanted
to
stop
it,
bu t
it
contin ued.
It
was
the
only
thing
that
ke pt
the
spirits
of
the
people ,
knowing
tha t
they
could
leave.
And
it
was
our
responsibility
to
carry
on
this
vast
prog
ram,
not
just
welfare,
but
from
the
cradle
to
dea th.
And
the
committee
ra n
everything.
Interviewer
:
 
The
cen tral
committee.
Theodore
:
 
The
cen tral
committee,
w hich
incide ntally
was
esta blished
based
on
the
politi cal
schlüssel
,
political
key,
as
there
was
in
Palestine.
And
you
had
the
Agudath.
You
had
the
Mapai.
You
had
the
Mapam.
You
had
th
e
poli
tical
methodology,
which
permeated
all
the
way
into
Eastern
Europe,
becaus e
those
that
went
were
out
of
certain
political
parties,
and
they
found
that
th ey
could
organize
grou ps
comin g
out
by
having
th is
additional
tie .
We ll,
we
ce
rtainly
tri
ed
to
do
what
we
could
in
order
to
hel p
the m.
Besides
the
food,
we
were
also
a
good
tie
to
the
mili tary.
For
example,
when
the
state
of
Israel
was
founded,
the n
th ere
was
normal
immi gr ation
to
Israe l,
except
for
one
thing .
The
Br itish
Army
ins isted
that
the r e
should
be
no
one
of
mil
itary
age
sent.
Cruel.
Terrible.
I
do n't
want
to
Œ

Interviewer
:
 
In
1948?
Theodore
:
 
Yeah,
sure.
The
British
ha d
th eir
ha nd
in
everything.
After
all,
th e
heads
of
the
UN RRA
and
the
IRO
were
all
Britis h
ge nerals,
and
who
were
they
talking
to?
They
wer
e
talki
 ng
to
the i r
hom e
office
who,
of
course,
did n't
want
immigration
to
Palestine
and
even
to
Israel.
And
there
was
one
tim e,
I
don't
want
to
me ntion
who
was
i nvolved,
but
I
talke d
to
some
of
the
people,
others
did
as
well,
that
how
cr uel
it
was
to
separate
families
at
this
stage
and
th
is
period
after
th e
war.
And
the
result
was
very
interesting.
The
person
who
said
he
was
going
to
examine
the
train,
said,
I
will
only
e xa mine
the
lef t
side
of
the
train.
I
wa nt
all
the
women
and
childre n
there.
Wha t
you
put
on
the
right
side
I
don't
care.
I'm
no
t
going
to
look
at
it.
Becaus e
I
have
to
ce rtify
tha t
I
ha ve
seen
this
train
and
only
women
and
childre n
have
gone.
And
so
there
you
were.
The
person
examined
the
left
side.
And
on
the
ri ght
side,
of
cours e,
were
the
h usbands
and
the
wi
ve
s
the
husbands
and
th e
kids
of
military
age.
And
it
went.
And
then
fina lly
when
IRO
closed
out,
th ey
de ci ded
that
ever yone
coul d
go.
Th e
 
le t
me
talk
about
the
ship
Exo dus
.
You
remember,
the
ship
that
was
sent
ba ck
to
France,
came
to
France,
and
the
pe
ople
did
n't
want
to
get
o ff.
They
were
on
a
h ung er
strike.
It
really
wasn't,
because
at
nigh t,
Herb
would
know,
boats
were
sent
to
put
fo od
on,
and
th e
people
ate.
The
ship
was
sent
back
to
Ham burg.
And
all
the
peopl e
were
offloaded
and
sent
to
a
cam p
called
Bergen
r
Belsen.
Within
one
month
,
every
perso
n
who
had
been
on
the
Exo dus
was
on
hi s
way
back
to
Palestine
in
the
un derground .
B r itish,
no
British,
the
valor
of
the
people
who
were
handling
th is
was
tre mendous.
But
le t
me
try
to
give
you
a
picture
of
what
it
was

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0335

like,
what
it
was
like
sitting
in
th e
office
in
Mu nic h
[München],
a
of
three,
across
the
str eet
wa s
the
ce ntral
commi ttee
and
they
had
a
very
fine
vill a
which
the
Army
had
given
the m.
And
next
there
was
a
long
street
nearby
called
Mohlstrasse.
The
area
was
a
very
fine
area
of
homes
which
had
be
en
ta ken
over
by
the
Army
and
so
on.
There
wasn't
a
day
that
there
wa sn't
an
in cide nt,
ei ther
with
German
pol ice,
our
peopl e
were
in
bla ck
mark et.
We
could n't
blame
them.
After
all,
they
had
be en
victi mize d.
If
they
had
a
possibil ity
of
ma king
a
few
dollars,
let
th
em
ma ke
it.
We,
als o ,
were
in
th e
black
market.
It
co st
two
cigaret tes
for
a
box
seat
in
the
W a gner
Opera
House
around
th e
corner.
Th e
director
was
a
man
by
the
name
of
Solti ,
the
present
Sir
(Georg)
So lti.
So
this
 
this
is
how
thi ngs
wor
ked.
The
committees
had
th
eir
purpose.
It
di dn't
always
parallel
ours.
For
exa mple,
they
were
so
strong,
they
felt
that
the
tremendous
warehouse
we
had
with
mi llions
of
poun ds
of
food
and
clothing
and
ci garett es
ought
to
be
u nder
the i r
control.
Yo u
know,
if
you're
a
politi ca l
group,
you
don't
stand
still.
You
try
to
go
forward
by
seei
ng
what
you
ca
n
gain,
like
politicians
any place.
And
th e
former
director,
a
fellow
by
na me
of
Leo
Schwartz,
who
is
an
author,
he
was
willing
to
turn
it
over
to
th em.
And
we
tho ught
that
wo uld
be
u npala table,
then
we
would
have
no
control.
And
so
the
contra
ct
was
signed
by
the
m,
and
th en
sent
to
Germany .
I
took
one
look
and
I
pu t
it
in
a
safe,
locked
it
up,
and
I
calle d
Herb,
and
I
said,
"Her b,
we
ca n't
sign
that,
because
that
would
be
givin g
over
to
the
co mmi ttee
thi ngs
th
at
our
board
certainly
wouldn't
want."
And
sure
enough,
that 's
what
ha ppe ned.
We
nev er
gave
it
to
them.
Interviewer
:
 
I
need
to
ask
you
a
few
qu estions.

Theodore
:
 
Sure.

Interviewer
:
 
To
clarify
this
for
people
who
don't
know
exactly
what
your
role
is
and
there
are
cer tain
terms,
like
the
ce
ntral
committee
that
you
sort
of
explained,
but
I
think
that
we
nee
d
to
be
a
li ttle
mo re
specific
so rt
of
for
those
who
migh t
watch
this.
When
you
went
to
work
for
the
Joint
 
th e
America n
Joint
Distribution
Committee,
what
was
your
role
and
wha t
was
your
function?
You
keep,
also,
referring
to
Her
b
,
so
I
ne ed
to
some
of
us
nee d
to
understan d
this.
Theodore
:
 
Yeah.
I
was
b r ought
on
as
the
dep uty
di rector
for
our
program
in
the
USO
in
Ge rmany,
which
mea ns
I
was
th e
number
two
ma n
in
this
prog ram.
I
had
specific
tasks.
From
an
administrativ
e
point
of
view,
with
personnel,
with
adm
inistration,
I
had
a
respo nsibility
for
liaison
with
th e
UN RRA
and
the
leader
of
the
IRO,
and
for
liaison
with
par t
of
the
military.
I
also
visited
the
camps
to
observe
and
to
report
where
we
mi ght
find
th ings
easier
to
do,
and
to
determine
that
our
food
and
clo
t
hing
was
pro perly
distri bu ted.
We
had
a
probl e m
at
the
outs et
because
it
wasn't
 
we
came
in,
in
1 945,
but
by
the
ti me
our
supply
lines
yes,
we
sent
tr ucks
up
to
Swede n
and
broug ht
back
food,
bu t
that
was
a
fly
in
the
buc
ket.
You
ne
eded
large
 
in
order
to
ta ke
care
of
a
group
of
a
quarter
of
a
million,
you
needed
a
large
warehouse.
You
ne eded
a
lot
of
trucks.
You
needed
a
lot
of
staff.
You
ne eded
security.
We
had
 
the
Army
gave
us
two
doze n
rifles
and
told
us
to
train
our
own
group
for
gu
arding
our
supplies.
Also,
not
only
security,
bu t
there
was
a
great
deal
of
thievery
 
couldn't
blame
them .
After
all,
if
you
put
one
carton
of
cigaret tes
and
try
to
hi de
it,
you
were
ahead
$50.
So
this
was
a
co nstant
proble m
we
had
of
security.
Also,
in
setting
up
th
e
pr
ogram
we
had
a
lot
of
new
people
comi ng
in,

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0335  
10 
 
  
 
 
and
I
was
responsible
for
placement
and
for
all
of
th e
factors
that
go
in
to
have
a
runnin g
orga nization.
It
was
Leo
S ch w artz,
he 's
w r itten
a
numb er
of
books,
was
busy.
The
director
is
busy.
As
dir ector,
you
had
to
be
constantly
p erdue
[?]
with
the
commi ttee
and
with
the
Arm
y
and
with
the
UNRR
A,
and
he
took
over
that
role .
We
were
consta n tly
thinking
of
new
programs
to
be
helpful
to
our
peo ple
within
th e
nee ds
that
were
de monstrated.
We
also
were
doing
our
be st
to
save
money.
We
did.
The
archives
will
show
that
one
of
th e
most
important
fo
ods
that
we
had
was
cigare
ttes.
We
were
able
not
we,
but
there
were
some
over
at
the
central
committee,
they
coul d
tell
you
th e
number
of
cal o ries
a
pack
of
cigare ttes
would
buy .
Th e
Army
in
its
infinite
wisdom
allowed
the
G. I™s
APO
privilege s.
They
didn 't
te ll
them
they
coul
dn't
bring
in
cigaret
tes.
So
millions
of
cigaret tes
were
comi ng
in
through
th e
Army.
The
Ar my
knew
about
it.
And
finally,
eventually,
only
in
1948
did
all
this
end,
so
th at
was
thr e e
years,
when
they
ha d
what
was
called
a
currency
reform.
They
took
the
Reic hsmarks,
which
were
about
500
to
a
dollar
,
and
convert
ed
it
to
De uts che
Marks.
At
that
point,
Germany
opened
up.
Instead
of
kee ping
hidd en
what
had
been
man ufactur ed
and
not
sell
it
for
the
chea p
Marks,
they
were
willing
to
sell
it
for
th e
Deutsche
Mark s.
And
it
was
true;
the
Deutsche
Mark
did
ge t
strong.
It
wa
s
as
if
from
one
day
ther e
were
no
flow ers,
and
the
next
day
there
were
peonies
all
over
Ger many.
And
we
had
to
be
very
se nsitive
to
all
of
this
in
what
we
wer e
distrib uti ng
durin g
that
period.
And
we
were
able
to
I'm
sort
of
walking
throu gh
one
area
that
I
was
involved
with.
We
co
nvince
d
the
Army
that
we
ough t
to
have
a
distri b ution
of
cigar ettes
to
the
workers,
because
the i r
salaries
were
small,
and
th ey
cer tainly
were
smoking.
We
always
talke d
about
smoking.
And
I'm
sorry
I
didn 't
take
a
copy
of
it,
but
the
Arm
y
pu
 t
out
a
directive
in
which
we
were
mentioned
about
the
distr ibution
of
ci g a rettes
to
working
mother s,
to
workers.
And
what
developed
was
that
instead
of
sp e nding
th e
b u dget,
we
didn 't.
And
the
money
that
was
saved,
and
it
was
into
the
milli ons
of
dollars,
were
use d
to
help
buy
th
e
ships
that
took
peo
ple
to
Palesti ne
and
Israel.
And
so
we
were
a
very
integral
part
of
that
whole
pi ctur e.
I
must
als o
say
a
personal
thi ng.
When
I
told
my
sister
that
I
was
my
sister,
Sara,
who
was
the
head
of
the
Pioneer
Women,
that
I
was
going
to
go
to
work
for
the
Joint,
her
immediate
re
ac
tion
was,
"Ted,
how
could
you
go
to
work
for
a
no n
r
Zionist
organization? "
I
said,
"Sara,
they've
ch anged. "
She
says,
"If
you
tell
me
so,
tha t's
fine."
And
we
di d
change.
We
were
more
inv o lved
in
thes e
areas.
As
a
matter
of
fact,
in
1948
we
opened
up
an
organi
za
tion
in
Israel
that
took
over
the
respons ibility
from
the
governmen t
of
Israel
of
all
the
han dicap ped,
the
elde rly,
and
sick
children
tha t
were
immigrating
to
Israel.
Just
think
of
it.
We
hade
a
caseload.
We've
built
hospitals.
If
we
hadn't,
peopl
e
wouldn
't
ha ve
moved
out
of
Germany .
So
it
was
important
for
us
to
establish
these
insti tutions
and
run
them,
run
the m.
We
took
it
off
the
back
of
Israel.
Eventually,
in
1955,
they
took
it
over.
And
so,
ge tti ng
ba ck
to
what
I
was
doi ng.
I
rambled
a
little
bi t
there.
We
were
always
on
the
alert
for
two
th
ings,
prote
cti ng
our
people
from
the
Army .
It
sounds
strange,
but,
you
know,
if
you
ha ve
a
mili tary
governmen t
and
you
have
mili tary
police,
and
you're
responsible
for
security
in
an
area,
and
you
have
these
lovely
Germans
who
don't
fight,
who
don't
mak
e
any
trou ble
for
you,
who
say
yes,
and
who
go
about
thei r
business,
and
you
have
these
hu ndreds
of
thousands
of
DPs
who
want
no
part
of
the
Army,
who
don't
think
that
they
should
have
to
be
disci pli ned
by
the
Army,
bu t
the
Army
said
if
there's
bla
ck
mark
et,
we're
responsible.
And
there
are
always
a
lot
of
people
who
felt,
well,
if
something
go es
wrong,
it's
pr obably
th e
DPs
down
th e
road.
It
wasn't
true.
And
to
our
people
who

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0335  
11 
 
  
 
 
were
there
in
such
an
important
role,
to
explain
exa ctly
what
was
happe ning .
And
I
think
we
wer e
successful
to
that
end.
But
if
it
hadn 't
been
for
President
Tru man
with
his
directives,
we
would
have
had
a
mu ch
more
difficult
tim e.
And
this
was
consta ntly
one
of
the
thi ngs
that
conc
ern ed
us
all
the
time,
be
cause
people
comin g
into
th e
camps,
they
were
coming
in
i llega lly,
and
the
Army
doesn't
li ke
ille gal
things.
They
don't
like
that
the
border
be twee n
Czechoslovakia
and
Bavaria
is
porous,
as
far
as
the
Je ws
were
concerned.
So
this
was
always
a
problem.
And
incidentally,
because
of
th
e
realization
th at
it
was
a
pr oblem,
the
h eadquarters
of
the
Army
in
Frankf urt,
u nder
urging
by
ma ny
agencies
in
th e
States,
had
an
advisor
in
Jewish
a ffairs,
the
co mmandi ng
general.
Some
very
important
people
were
there,
Ju dge
L eventhal
of
Philadelphia,
Rabbi
Bernstein,
and
th ey
were
a
buffer
betw een
th
e
Army
at
the
top
level
where
th
ere
was
probably
more
interest
and
more
w illingness
to
be
reasonable
than
down
at
the
lower
level
of
the
GI
who
has
a
fraulein
who
kee ps
ta lking
about
how
the
Jews
are
getti ng
so
mu ch
more
than
we
poor
Ger mans
and
he 's
in
the
milita
r y
governme
nt,
and
he
has
no
love
for
th e
displaced
person s.
Interviewer
:
Explai n
to
me
something
about
this
hi er archy
that
th e
U.S.
Army
was
basically
in
charge
of
the
zone.

Theodore
:
 
Yes.
There
were
four
zone s.
There
was
a
French,
British,
Russian,
and
America n.
There
were
no
DPs
in
th
e
Russian
zone.
Interviewer
:
 
Then
how
did
the
UNRRA,
the
Join t,
all
of
these
other
organizations
fit
into
the
structure
in
ter ms
of
the
possibility
in
working
with
th e
camp?
Theodore
:
 
The
Army
well,
not
really
the
Army,
the
Unit ed
Sta tes
authorized
th e
UN RRA
to
work
in
Germany.
That's
why
th
ey
sent
out
that
original
doc
ument
to
look
for
staff,
because
they
knew
th at
th e
Army
could
never,
could
never
be
responsible
for
takin g
care
of
civilians,
espe cially
this
difficult
group .
And
they
nee d ed
help.
And
they
wanted
the
UN RRA.
And
they
were
very
pleased
when
the
UNRRA
went
ahead
and
buil
t
their
agency
qui ckl y
and
took
over
be cause
th e
Army
was
not
able
to.
The
Army,
from
a
medi cal
point
of
view,
was
magnificent.
You
know,
everybody
 
th ey
would
ma ke
sure
that
typhoid
and
so
on
and
so
forth,
ev erybody
was
powdered.
They
cou ld
set
up
medi cal
things.
But
when
it
ca
me
to
looking
after
the
people,
carin g
for
th em,
the
needs
that
were
de monstr ated,
they
kn ew
th ey
coul dn't.
And,
therefore,
the
UN RRA
came
in.
The
UN RR A
was
given
a
mand ate.
Ther e
had
never
bee n
an
UN RRA
before.
The
Ar my
ha d
never
had
to
work
with
a
civilian
organization.
And
a
lot
of
the
m
didn
't
like
it,
which
was
probably
one
of
the
reasons
that
the
pi cture
I
showed
you
with
th e
six
generals,
all
of
the
UN RR A,
that 's
the
brass
that
wa s
there
in
order
to
inter cede.
And
so
the
UN RR A
was
given
responsibility
of
looking
after
the
ca mps,
maintaining
the
cam
p
s,
getti ng
the
food
couldn 't
swim.
You
think
of
tryin g
to
feed
Ar my ,
the
te n
and
one
ration
to
chil dren
and
to
women.
It
was
too
much,
really.
But
th at's
what
they
had
at
the
very
outs et
and
that's
one
of
th e
reasons
we
brought
in
as
mu ch
food
as
we
did
.
Then
th
e
mili tary
was
also
responsible
for
security.
Now,
security,
anything.
They
raided
camps
and
were
very
mu ch
upset
that
the
people
were
smarter
than
the y .
They
didn't
know
one
DP
from
another.
The
Army,
for
exa mple,
rations ,
that 's
a
goo d
Army
way.
There's
a
camp,
let's
say
Wolfitzha
u
sen
[Wolfratshausen?]
had
2,000,
me n,

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0335  
12 
 
  
 
 
women,
children.
They
ne ed
rations
for
a
whole
mon th.
They
nee d
so
many
gal lons
of
this
and
so
many
tons
of
this.
And
that
was
it.
But
when
it
came
to
the
utili za tion
of
the
food,
the
Ar my
di dn't
have
any
kind
of
know
r
how.
They
cou l dn 't
send
in
their
own
side.
So
this
was
U
N
RRA 's
respo nsibility
and
UN RRA
had
to
know
every thing.

Interviewer
:
 
We
were
talking
about
the
structure
in
post
r
war
Eur o pe
and
you
were
explaini ng
about
the
U. S.
Mili tary
and
the
U.S.
Zone
and
the
UNR RA.
Then,
now
tha t
we've
established
that
the
UNRR
A
neede
d
to
carry
out
a
lo t
of
wha t
the
military
could
not,
how
do es
the
Joint
fit
into
the
pi cture?
Theodore
:
 
Well
Œ
Interviewer
:
 
We
should
say
the
American
Joint
Distribution
Comm ittee .
Theodore
:
 
American
Je wish
Distribution
Commi ttee.
Let
me
ta lk
a
li ttle
bi t
about
voluntary
agencies
and
the
dile
mma
they
have
in
carrying
on
prog
rams
in
disaster
areas.
It's
always
a
mess.
When
you
have
a
disaster,
no
matter
how
well
trai ned
the
peop le
are,
somehow
or
another
ther e
are
so
man y
different
groupings,
the
governmen t,
the
Red
Cross.
It's
a
caritas.
Coordination
is
so
e ssential.
In
Germany
there
was
the
army,
sacrosanct.
Th
ey
had
a
res
ponsibility
be cause
they
were
carrying
out
 
they
were
runnin g
the
Germans,
the
mili tary
gove rnmen t.
Th ei r
responsibility
was
to
ge t
them
on
their
f eet.
Th ey
calle d
in
the
UNR RA
be cause
they
r e alized
very
quickly
back
in
early
1945
that
something
had
to
be
done
an
d
they
could
n't
do
it,
or
they
di dn't
wa nt
to
do
it.
That
wasn't
their
job.
That
wasn't
why
you
beca me
a
general,
to
look
after
some
people.
And
so
the
UN RR A
cam e
in
and
was
given
r esponsibility
for
runnin g
the
ca mps
with
the
backing
of
the
army
who
brou
ght
in
medi ca l
suppli es,
who
brought
in
food
and
so
on,
and
they
set
up
a
system
of
distri bution,
and
then,
of
course,
hun g
around
the
camps.
Ev ery
cam p
had
a
committee.
Ours
were
Jewi sh
com mitt e e.
We
foster ed
the
central
committee.
We
were
allowed
to
co me
in
Œ
Interviewer
:
Now
using
th e
ter m
"we"
again,
and
I
know
you
wer e
with
the
U N RRA
and
you
were
with
the
Join t ,
so
we
nee d
to
be
clear
he re.
Theodore
:
 
I'm
sorry.
I
don't
want
to
say
we
with
the
UNR RA.
I'll
say
we
with
the
Join t.
The
voluntary
the
JDC
is
a
voluntary
agency.
We
were
working
in
man
y
areas
in
Europe
before
th e
end
of
the
war.
We
wer e
into
Italy.
We
were
into
Fran ce
and
Belgium,
Holland.
Ho wever,
there
was
some
co ncern
for
whatever
reason
for
brin ging
the
JDC
and
other
voluntary
agenci es
into
Ger m any.
The
U N RRA
had
to
ask
permission
from
the
military
and
it
wasn't
un
t
il
June
tha t
we
came
in,
for
whatever
the i r
reason.
Th ey
had
many
reasons,
commu nication.
They
were
afraid,
s till,
that
ther e
may
have
been
an
undergrou nd .
We
were
to ld
when
we
were
ridi ng
in
th e
jeep,
never
ride
with
your
front
glass
down,
keep
it
up
,
be
cause
the
Ger mans
had
pu t
wires
across
and
so
on.
So
there
was
the
dang er
aspect,
overexagerate d ,
but
mili tary
has
to,
you
know,
security
is
security.
And
finally
the
U N RRA
had
to
put
into
moti on
a
portion
of
their
organ ization

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0335  
13 
 
  
 
 
to
look
after
us.
Not
that
we
were
so
terrible,
but
we
nee ded
ho using.
We
ne eded
uniforms.
We
wanted
to
be
part
of
the
PX
and,
of
co urse,
that 's
where
the
army,
rankled
with
civilians,
was
going
to
th e
PX.
Wha t
I'm
saying
is
that
at
the
outset
all
voluntary
agencies
had
a
difficult
ti
me
get
ting
in.
On ce
we
ca me
in,
we
wer e
there
as
agents,
as
pa rt
of
the
UN R RA.
Th ere
was
a
departm ent.
We
repo rted.
We
got
everything
th rough
them.
They
looked
after
all
of
gasoline,
for
example,
permission
to
bring
in
truck s
and
so
on.
So,
this
is
where
we
stood.
Th
ey
knew
our
people.
They
worked
with
us
in
our
plan ning.
They
were
prote ctiv e
of
us
becau s e
they
weren't
having
an
easy
tim e.
And
the
fact
I
ke ep
comin g
back
to
the
ge nera ls.
The
gener a ls
did
a
lot
of
scotch
drin king
with
th e
generals
on
th e
other
side
to
hel
p
smooth
th
e
way
for
us
to
come
in
and
work.
Once
we
wer e
in
there,
they
left
us
alone.
We
got
our
PX
card.
We
got
gasoline
for
our
tru cks.
We
bou ght
j eeps
and
tru cks
from
the
army
for
 
they
were
givin g
it
away,
after
a ll.
And
so
thi s
was
how
we
were
ther
e.
Interviewer
:
 
What
di d
you
what
is
the
work
that
yo u
that
the
Joint
di d,
how
was
it
differe ntiate d
from
what
th e
UNRRA
did ?
Theodore
:
 
UN RR A
had
basic
respons ibility
for
f ee ding,
for
clothing,
medi cal ,
but
th ere
was
low
standard.
Th e
average
cal o ric
me nu
wa s
about
1,200
calories
a
da
y.
That
is
not
mu ch.
And
they
wer e
bad
calorie s ,
as
I
told
yo u.
They
were
giving
us
the
ten
and
one
ration
that
the
army
put
out,
which
are
numbered
ten
cans
of
Hungarian
goulash
or
w hatever,
the
cigare tte s,
in
th ese
bo xes.
And
so
the
level
of
food
was
very
low.
And,
the
refore,
we
mad
e
pro v isions
for
bringing
food
in.
They
probab ly
used
the i r
cigaret tes
for
purchasin g,
which
is
all
ri ght.
The
army
didn 't
mi nd
that,
because
whenever
our
people
were
doing
were
pean uts
compared
to
what
the
army
was
doing.
So,
you
know ,
they
didn't
make
too
much
nois
e
about
it.
But
we
went
cl oser
to
the
people.
We
went
closer
to
the
people .
Our
re prese ntatives
in
the
big
ca mps
sat
in
with
the
cen tral
committee
every
day
in
the
proble ms
of
runnin g
a
camp
and
how
we
could
hel p
th em,
what
were
those
th ings
that
they
didn
't
have
that
we
had
or
coul
d
ge t.
So
we
enhan ced
the
diet.
We
had
a
lar ge
numb er
of
TB's.
We
were
th e
first
to
bring
peni cilli n
into
Vienna
and
into
Germany .
We
were
su pplem enti ng
because
the
UN RRA
was
unable
 
they
didn't
speak
the
lan guage,
le t's
put
it
bl un tly
as
that
wh
e
re
our
people
would
speak
to
us.
We
coul d
get
to
know
mor e
about
what
was
happe ni ng
than
any
UN RRA
person.
And
so
we
were
sort
of
the
cushion
be twee n
th e
people
and
what
they
were
suppo sed
to
get
from
the
UN RRA.
Interviewer
:
 
What
other
ways
were
you
able
to
suppleme
nt,
other
than
givin
g
the m
food?

Theodore
:
 
Well,
food,
m e dici ne,
cloth ing,
a
gr eat
deal
of
clot hin g,
cigare ttes.

Interviewer
:
 
Did
you
get
involved
in
education
or
vocational
train ing
or
Œ
Theodore
:
 
Oh,
yeah.
Interviewer
:
 
with
this
activity?

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0335

Theodore
:
 
We
even
printed
a
Talmud.
Yes.
Yes.
We
had
Rabbi
on
our
staff,
two
rabbis,
as
a
matter
of
fact.
We
had
an
educator
on
our
staff.
We
brough t
teachers
from
Pal estine
to
the
schools.
Now
the
question
is
where
in
1947
were
you
with
childre n
that
neede d
educa tion?
Well,
tha
t
wa
s
a
miracle .
These
were
children
who
ca me
from
the
East,
who
had
lived
un dergroun d
with
their
f a milies,
or
were
Russian
and
came
in.
So
we
 
as
a
matter
of
fact,
I
think
we
had
twe n ty
tea chers
b r ought
from
Israel.
One
thing
they
had
to
have,
Yiddish.
If
they
did
n't
hav
 e
th e
Yi ddish,
they
weren't
good
tea che rs.
Every
part
of
their
daily
living
we,
in
one
way
or
another,
touched .
And,
of
course,
when
we
set
up
our
i m migration
in
1948,
we
hel ped
tens
of
thousands
of
people
to
immigrate.
They
used
to
have
a
ter m;
the
Joint
is
"unser
Vater."
The
Joint
is
ou
r
rescuer.
But
that
didn't
mean
that
they
looked
at
us
and
we
were
living
fairly
comfortably.
We
weren™t
paid
bi g
salaries.
I
remember
my
salary
was
$7,000
a
year.
It
was
a
good
salary
at
that
time.
But
the y
weren't
jealous
because
they
knew
tha t
when
they
neede
d
help,
we
were
there.
We
would
pr otect
th em
from
th e
mi lita r y
governme nt.
We
had
lawyers
on
our
staff.
We
brough t
in
surgeons
for
the
TB
hospita l
for
operatio ns.
We
fille d
the
camps
that
the
UNR RA
co uldn't
do.
On
the
other
ha nd,
we
were
always
aware
of
the
fact
that
a
nu
mber
of
workers,
that
ever
ything
was
fu nctioni ng,
and
tha t
the
pe ople
deserved
better
pay,
or
cig a rettes,
and
we
ke pt
their
spirits
hi gh.
We
were
th e r e.
And
that
they
kn e w
that
the
Joint
could
deliv er.
Many
of
them
knew
Joi nt
before
the
war,
where
we
ha d
operated
in
Eastern
Europe
for
so
ma
ny
years,
immediate
ly
after
World
War
I.
So
it
wasn't
li ke
we
were
new.
We
were
Jew s ,
Jews.
And
they
 
and
I
think
we
were
pre tty
good
Jews,
be cause
we
understood
what
it
was
that
was
moving
them
and
what
it
was
that
they
wa nted
and
what
they
wanted
to
do.
And
we
,
in
our
own
way,
helped.
We
were
a
dir ect
line
of
the
co mmittee
who
were
f unctio ning.
If
th e
Joint
had
had
to
run
our
program
with
our
own
sta ff,
we
coul dn't
have.
Where
would
you
get
the
thousands
of
workers
in
these
cam ps
who
were
paid,
who
were
fu
nctioni
ng,
who
were
delivering
ser v ices?
If
we
had
set
tha t
up,
first
of
all,
we
wouldn't
have
had
en ough
money.
And
many
other
v o luntary
agencies
were
never
able
to
f igure
out
ho w
we
wer e
able
to
work
so
well,
beca use
th ey
cam e
as
stranger s
to
whomev er
th ey
were
helping.
But
when
it
came
to
our
people,
th
e
wo
rd
Joint
was
s o mething
sy mbolic
with
their
people
being
rescued
and
helping
towa rds
their
future
of
moving
out
of
there.
And
when
we
tol d
the m
about
i mmigration,
they
saw
our
i nvolvement
with
the
underground
to
Israel,
I
don't
want
to
say
they
be
haved
themself,
but
they
understood
what
was
happeni ng.
Not
that
they
weren't
criti c al
of
us,
bu t
never
min d.
That's
a
love
r
hate
affair.

th
ere

I

you

with.

Theodore
:
 
Personnel,
in
January
of
19 46,
we
had
44
employe es.
In
Jan uary
of
1947,
we
ha d
294.
And
in
Ja nuar y
of
1948,
we
had
560
employees.
But
that
does
not
in
c
lude
all
th e
workers
in
the
cam p.
These
were
peopl e
who
wer e
responsible
to
us,
who
wer e
our

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0335

chann el
to
th e
people .
We
had
let's
see,
in
1946
we
had
38
e mployees
who
were
from
the
United
States.
In
1947,
we
had
86.
And
in
1 948,
we
had
110.
That
wa s
our
staff.
Interviewer
:
 
Where
wer e
the
rest
of
th em
from?

Theodore
:
 
Pardon?
Interviewer
:
 
Where
the
you
mean
th
e
rest
of
the
m
were
th e
people
from
th e
cam p?
Theodore
:
 
Yeah.

Interviewer
:
 
I
can' t
imagine
you
going
in
with
44
employees
in
19 45.
That's
not
many .

Theodore
:
 
Well,
tha t
 
we
had
de cid e d
soon
on
that
re cruiti ng
in
the
United
States
was
very
difficult.
And
we
made
a
plea
to
many
peop
le
about
se
rvicemen
who
wanted
to
work
overseas.
And
we
got
quite
a
few
tha t
way,
like
myself.
And
any
 
you
know,
in
th e
begin ning
th ere
were
only
about
30,00 0
or
40,000.
Our
supplies
hadn't
started
comi ng
in.
The
bes t
that
we
coul d
do
is
work
with
the
com
mi
ttee
who
wer e
there.
We
f o und
 
we
did n't
found
the
committee,
we
found
them.
And
th ey
wer e
there.
And
they
were
important.
Without
th e m ,
we
couldn't
have
carried
on
our
prog ram,
could n't
have.
Interviewer
:
 
Were
you
able
to
work
with
most
of
the
cam ps,
or
just
the
larger
ones?
Theodore
:
Every
ca
mp.
Every
ca mp.

Interviewer
:
 
Every
Jewish
DP
camp?

Theodore
:
 
Yeah.
Wher e v er
yes.

Interviewer
:
 
And
there
were
many.
Theodore
:
 
Yes.
 
Interviewer
:
 
Just
for
th e
record,
when
you
talk
about
the
cen tral
commi ttee,
you've
referred
to
it
in
many
terms.
Theodore
:
 
Yes.
Interviewer
:
 
There
were
al
so
committe
es
at
ea ch
ca mp;
is
that
co rrect?

Theodore
:
 
Yeah.
Let
me
talk
about
how
they
functioned.
As
I
say,
we
found
them
there.
They
had
been
help ed
to
organize
by
a
nu mber
of
Jewish
r
American
Ar my
C haplains.
And
th ey
accep ted
th ei r
role.
They
were
serious.
As
a
matter
of
fact,
in
194
6
Ben
r
Gurion
visited,
and
he
was
their
guest.
And
it's
i nteres ting
that
someone
was
will ing
to
pu t
for ward
to
Mr.
Ben
r
Gurion
that
the
ci ty
of
S tut tgar t,
if
he
felt
th at
he
wanted
all
the
Jews
to
inhabit
that
one
city,
they
though t
they
coul d
work
it
throug
h
with
the
mi
litary
govern ment
and

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0335  
16 
 
  
 
 
the
army
and
the
Germans.
He
got
so
excited
and
so
mad.
How
dare
you
bring
up
such
a
thin g?
No
Jew
will
remain
here
that
should
be
in
P a lestine.
But
this
is
the
co mmittee.
They
were
thi nking
how
ca n
we?
After
all,
there
wer e
buil dings,
there
wer e
fa ctories.
This
would
be
a
good
place
and
so
on.
The
commi
ttee
saw
their
role
as
a
part
of
us,
and
as
a
part
of
us.
We
me t
ev ery
day.
We
I
shouldn't
have
said
that.
We
met
 
generally
the
committe e
like d
to
me et
at
nig ht,
because
durin g
th e
day
th e y
were
busy.
And
they
also
knew
that
when
it
go
t
to
be
about
12:00
or
1:00,
we
got
tire d .
And
it
was
at
tha t
point
that
th ey
would
bring
up
some
of
the
r equests
that
they
felt
they
could n't
pass
early
in
the
day.
But
by
th e
ti me
we
got
tired,
we'd
say
okay,
another
thing,
anot
h
er
thing .
Ther e
was
a
mutual
respect
on
their
part,
real izing,
even
th ough
most
of
us
had
never
be en
in
the
Holocaus t
or
the
Shoah,
yet
they
u nderstood
ho w
we
wer e
w o rking,
how
we
needed
to
functio n
in
order
to
be
able
to
ha ve
our
com mi ttee
in
the
United
States
a
cce
pt
what
we
wer e
doing .
And
when
they
be gan
leaving,
things
began
getting
more
difficult.
We
had
to
take
more
responsibility.
Interviewer
:
 
Were
they
responsible
to
committees
within
each
ca mp?
Were
th ere
also
committees
within
each
camp,
self
r
gov ernmen t?

Theodore
:
 
They
weren't
responsible.
The
commi ttees
in
the
ca
mp
wer
e
res ponsible
to
them.
That
was
the
chan nel.

Interviewer
:
 
But
each
cam p
had
a
self
r
governing
committee.

Theodore
:
 
That's
ri ght.
All
of
th em
ti ed
into
the
central
commi ttee .
They
di dn't
always
a gree.
There
were
a r gume nts
and
so
on,
bu t
it
was
a
norm al
kind
of
rea ction
that
they
had
to
each
other.
But
when
thi
ngs
got
toug
h
and
when
pe ople
be gan
being
moved
a r ound,
the
committe e
was
very
important.
Because
at
one
point,
th e
army
or
Ger man
governmen t
said
we
would
like
to
cons olidate
the
ca mps,
be cause
after
all,
ther e
was
a
lot
of
all
these
people
co m i ng
from
the
east
tha
t
wer e
living
pre tty
badly
and
th ey
wanted
to
ha ve
these .
And
tha t
was
als o
a
point
where
Jews
were
moving
out.
By
1948
and
1949,
American
immigration
had
set
up
 
or
it
began,
base d
on
what
was
called
the
Truman
Directive,
tha t
anybody
who
had
be en
in
camp
would
ha
ve
a
priority
in
immigrating
to
the
Un
ited
States.
So,
that
was
th e
atmosphere
at
that
point.
The
commi ttee,
of
course,
would
like
 
would
have
liked
them
all
to
go
to
Israel,
bu t
not
all
the
people
wanted
that .
They
had
 
ma ny
had
relativ es
in
the
United
States.
They
had
friends
who
were
not
Zionists.
But
whe
n
it
ca
me
to
commi ttees
that
visited
the
cam ps,
they
were
all
unite d.
Th ey
all
wanted
to
go
to
Israel.

Interviewer
:
 
So
was
the
pr imary
goal
of
the
cen tral
committee
to
work
with
you
and
other
aid
organizations
to
ge t
what
they
ne
ede d
for
the
displaced
people?

Theodore
:
 
Yes.

Interviewer
:
 
I'm
just
trying
to
u nderstan d.

Theodore
:
 
Yes.
We
felt
that
not
that
we
didn 't
have
our
own
experts
about
what
it
is
that
we
neede d
sent
to
the m
 
but
we
relied
on
th eir
da ta
and
on
the i r
fo rthrigh tness
as
to

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0335  
17 
 
  
 
 
what
were
the
priorities.
We
liste ned
to
the m.
And
when
we
made
a
distribu tion,
we
worked
with
them .
So
it
was
well
financed
by
us.
We
felt
it
was
important.
We
gave
them
status.
After
all,
they
had
status
with
a
colonel
from
the
U.S.
Army
who
ca me
over
every
day,
co
uldn't
talk
to
them,
although
few
spoke
English.
He
would
co me
over
and
schmooze
with
us
as
to
what
was
going
on.
And
when
there
was
something
re ally
desperate,
we
did
call
th e
colonel.
Th er e
were
inci de nts
once
where
some
fello w
decid ed
that
the
black
mar ket
on
Mohlstrasse
ought
to
be
done
aw
ay
with.
And
instea d
of
coming
with
th e
military
police,
they
came
with
German
poli ce,
armed,
armed.
It
came
to
us
about
five
min utes
after
it
b egan.
One
person
had
already
be en
shot.
And
instead
of
th e
mili tary
gov ernmen t
pulli ng
these
police
out,
someone
says
clea r
the
street.
It
was
two
very
long
blocks.
And
they
were
ri
ght
around
th
e
corner
from
our
office.
And
meanwhil e,
a
crowd
of
probably
500
ha d
gathered
at
the
other
end
of
Mohlstrasse,
at
which
point
my
colleague,
Dr.
Kahan e ,
who
die d
the
other
day,
and
I
ran
out.
And
not
knowing
wha t
to
do,
t
hough
we
cer
tainl y
didn 't
want
to
go
to
wher e
th e
police
were,
and
when
we
realized
that
the
group
wa s
slowly
walking
up
the
streets,
500.
Nothing
in
their
hand s,
no
stones,
no
sticks.
And
th e
people
looked
at
me.
I
looked
at
the m,
and
said,
"Let's
go."
So
down
we
ran
to
the
group
and
we
walked
with
them
.
By
tha
t
ti me
somebody
with
a
li ttle
more
sens e
had
de cide d
tha t
they
weren't
going
to
start
a
third
world
war,
and
wi thdrew
the
German
poli ce.
And
it
never
happen ed
again.
And
that
didn 't
mak e
us
exactly
he roes,
because
we
wer
e
stupid,
bu
t
it
happen ed
jus t
that
way.
And
so
the
army
knew
what
was
happ e ning.
All
the
black
market
we
kn ew,
we
wer e n't
involved.
It
wasn't
our
responsibility ,
and
the
ce n tral
commi ttee
status
was
raised
by
th e
fact
that
they
had
broug ht
about
this
reaction
to
the
use
of
Germans,
because
this
was
1947,
late
1947,
ea
rly
1948.
And
it
made
hea dlines
in
the
Uni ted
States.
The
mili tary
governm ent
was
told
in
no
uncertai n
ter ms
that
they
had
done
wrong.
So
this
was
the
co mmi tte e.
Interviewer
:
 
When
you
started
working
with
the
Joi nt
in
1946,
what
was
the
si tuation
in
the
cam
p
?
Were
they
pretty
well
orga nized
at
that
point?
Theodore
:
 
Yes.
They
ce rtainly
were
organized.
We
had
not
yet
come
to
our
full
capa cit y
of
bringin g
in
supplies.
Now,
it
was
very
difficult.
You
can
only
land
in
Fran ce
or
in
Hamburg .
And
for
th e
army,
for
some
re
ason,
only
landed
in
Ham burg.
So
we
had
to
set
up
warehouses,
and
there's
pi ctures
in
this
thin g,
because
wha t
we
had
we
couldn 't
make
a
full
di stribution
to
everybody.
So
we
had
to
make
decisio ns
as
to
who
got
what
when,
and
that
wasn't
very
easy.
It
wa s
very
crue
l.
But
it
was
the
best
tha t
we
coul d
do,
except
th at
we
did
have
ci garett es.

Interviewer
:
 
How
di d
you
make
those
decisions?

Theodore
:
 
With
the
committee.
With
the
committee.
We
tried
to
assess,
because
not
every
cam p
was
the
same
as
far
as
the
UN RRA
suppl ies
they
were
getting
.
And
so
we
kn
ew
that
there
was
some
no t
 
just
better
su ppl y
officers
in
one
ca mp
than
in
the
other.
And
we
knew
just
what
was
happ e ning,
and
we
made
the
de cision
on
tha t.

Interviewer
:
 
Where
did
yo u
ge t
your
supplies
from?

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0335

Theodore
:
 
We
bough t
cigarettes
in
S w itzerlan d,
some
food,
bu t
it
was
all
 
there
wasn't
e nough.
So
we
ha d
to
bring
it
in
fro m
the
Uni ted
States.
So
th at
ti me
in
19 47,
we
really
started
to
get
our
supplies,
and
by
1948
ther e
was
a
consta nt
movemen t
of
suppli es.
Interviewer
:
 
And
was
this
mostly
privately
funded?

Theodore
:
All,
all.
Anything
we
broug ht
in
was
funded
by
the
JD C
through
the
United
Jewi sh
Appeal.
As
a
matter
of
fact,
yes,
we
got
some
mon ey
from
Sou th
Africa,
bu t
this
was
all
JDC
money.

Interviewer
:
 
Did
you
have
specialists
on
your
staff
wh
o
knew
how
to
procure
s
upplies
and
do
all
of
this
ki nd
of
stuff?
I
mean,
it's
a
big
job.
Theodore
:
 
Oh,
yeah.
W ell,
that 's
where
the
local
people
were
so
good,
because
they
 
as
I
mentioned
before,
the
Ge rmans
weren't
sitting
by
idly.
The
Ger m ans
were
pro duci ng,
but
they
di
dn 't
want
to
sell
.
As
I
say,
th e
Rei chsmark
had
no
value.
You
would
li ght
kids
lit
ci gare ttes
with
100
Marks,
and
so
on.
We
ha d
some
very
fine
people
on
our
staff
and
who
kne w
where
some
of
th e
stuff
was
and
ne g o tiations
would
tak e
pla ce,
and
we
would
ge
t
it
if
it
was
and
they
also
kn ew
tha t
we
were
willing
to
pay
in
dollars
in
the
States
or
w he rever.
And
in
every
area
there
wer e
eggs
and
butter
and
chi cke ns.
And
so
each
camp
had
its
own
ch annel
of
where
to
buy
things.
There
was
one
story
of
the
first
Unit
ed
Jewis
h
Appeal
mission
to
Germany,
and
it
came
in
Fe brua ry
of
1947.
It
was
the
first
airliner
to
fly
into
Munich
[München].
There
were
no
steps
so
they
came
down
a
ladder.
Th er e
were
40
me n
and
women,
all
dressed
as
if
th ey
were
going
on
a
hi
ke
into
the
moun
tain s,
you
know.
Winter clothe s
and
so
on,
and
they
came
to
see
the
programs.
And
the
leader ship
looked
aside
and
said,
look,
we
know
what
we're
doing,
but
the
peopl e
ough t
to
see
what
th e
U N RRA
is
giving.
So,
we
aga in
used
a
cam p
calle d
Feldafing,
and
we
talke
d
to
the
dire
ctor s
and
said,
we
want
th e
people
to
see
the
menu
for
that
day
as
publishe d
by
the
UNRRA,
and
we
want
the m
to
eat
dinner
and
br eakfast
based
on
the
UN
nutri tiona l
men u,
and
don't
deviate
one
iota.
Give
it
to
the m.
Now,
we
kn ew
that
generally
for
dinn
er
they
would
ge t
tw o
or
three
slices
of
bread.
They
migh t
ge t
small
butter.
They
mig ht
hav e
one
slice
of
cold
cut .
And
they
would
have
tea.
That
was
din ner.
For
brea kfast
it
was
bl ack
br ead
and
bu tter
and
a
littl e
jam.
That
was
it.
And
he
also
said,
we
wa
nt
to
live
li
ke
some
of
the m
live.
W ell,
show
us
where
th ey're
living
and
set
up
a
place
and
te n
of
us
will
stay
overni ght.
Fi ne.
And
it's
tru e
tha t
there
was
barracks
[for]
living
there.
So
we
to ok
one
second
floor
barracks,
which
was
a
military
barrack,
and
the
bathrooms
were
a
doze
n
sinks
and
so
on.
And
we
set
up
their
beds
with
ma ttress
filled
with
straw,
which
the
people
but
we
did
give
the m
a
lot
of
blankets.
And,
of
course,
the
w indows
we
covered
over
and
so
on.
They
und er stood.
The
morning
that
they
wer
e
to
go
out
there,
I
sent
th e
fellow
who
wrote
th e
do cume nt.
I
said,
"Go
out
there
and
see
if
everythi ng
is
set."
Th ey
don't
want
what
we're
giving
them .
They
don't
want
any
trace
of
it.
Just
what
the
UN RRA
is
givi ng
them
toda y.
Half
r
hour
later
he
said,
"Mr
.
Fe
der,
I'm
here,
but
a
terrible
thi ng
has
ha ppene d,
also
a
nice
thing."
The
committee
felt
that
if
th ey
were
going
to
greet
and
entertain
the
people
who
were
hel ping
the m,
they
ough t
to
gi ve

a

What's
there?
He
says,
"Well,
I
tel l
you,
it's
a
nice
meal.
There's
chi
c
ken
and
ther e's
eve n
a
piece
of
por k."
I
said,
"Ge t
it
out.
Bring
it
over
to
the
hospital
and
pu t
it
in
their
kitchen ."
"But
they're

going
to
argue
with
me."
I
said,
"Don' t
argue.
Tell
them
we
won't
give
them
th eir
ne xt
month 's
ratio n
if
they
don't."
I
said,
"L e t
these
people
see
what
th e
UNRRA's
gi ving
them ."
Well,
it
was
the
most
successful
mission
in
th e
history
of
the
UJA,
beca use
what
they
saw
was
honest.
The
y
saw
what
the
peop
le
had
be en
livi ng.
And
then
th ey
also
saw
a
differe nce
betw een
what
they
ha d
and
what
the
people
were
eating,
bas ed
on
what
we
had
done
for
them.
As
they
came
to
the
ca mp,
peop le
were
sitti ng
outside.
The
bus
pulle d
up
and
th ese
te n
peop
le
walked
out.
Our
people
had
never
seen
peopl e
dressed
that
way.
They
th ought
they
lo oked
like
bums.
And
when
th ey
wer e
introduced,
these
are
the
people
from
the
Unit ed
Sta tes,
they
looked
at
th em,
and
they
kissed
them,
and
they
said
we
would
never
have
re cognize d
you.
There's
also
a
story
about
Yah
udi
Me
nuhi n
and
Leonard
Bernstein.
Ya hu da
Menuh in,
very
littl e
guy,
made
a
terrible
mista ke;
although,
in
his
way
of
think i ng,
he
was
right.
He
came
to
Ger many
too
early.
He
came
in
early
1 947
and
gave
a
con cert
in
Germany .
Our
people
were
roused.
They
were
angry;
and
th
e
Jews
should
come
and
play
for
the
Nazis .
He
asked
 
let's
see,
there 's
a
mi litary
governm ent,
if
he
coul d
visit
a
Jewis h
DP
cam p.
And
I
said
yes .
And
they
called
and
our
peopl e
were
ther e,
and
as
they
came
up,
th ey
were
booing
him.
They
were
shaking
their
fists
at
him.
No
one
di
d
any
t hing
to
hi m.
No
one
touch ed
hi m,
but
he
had
a
great
fear.
He
saw
it.
When
he
ca me
to
Frankfurt,
he
told
th e
sto r y
to
the
then
advisor
on
Jewish
affairs,
Judge
Le venthal
of
Ph iladelphia,
told
a
story,
and
says,
"Why
are
th e y
like
this?
"
He
said,
"Look,
I'm
not
goi ng
to
answer
you.
I'm
going
to
show
you
somethi ng. "
He
took
him
over
to
the
Fed eral
Depository,
and
took
him
in
the
basement
in
a
where
it
was
locked.
He
says,
"Come
look."
And
what
was
there
wer e
gold
fillings
that
were
Je w i sh.
He
did
say
a
word
ex
c
ept,
"Mr.
Yahudi
Menu hin,
that's
why
they
did
what
they
di d."
Leonard
Bernstein
wa s
another
thi ng.
On e
day,
it
must
have
bee n
in
1948,
the
ph one
rings
and
a
man
says,
"My
na me
is
Leonard
Berns tein.
Is
this
the
Jewis h
Joint?"
I
said,
"Y es."
He
said,
"I
need
help.
"
"Wha t
is
it? "
"Well,
I'm
here
to
cond uct
th e
Mun i ch
Phil harmo nic
and
there 's
a
strike
and
the
orches tra
can' t
come
to
rehe arsals.
Is
the r e
any
way
you
could
hel p
us?"
So,
Sa m
Haber,
th e
director,
said,
"Sure .
How
many
people
are
the r e?
Let
us
speak
to
persons
arranging.
"
So
it
wound
up
th
at
we
sent
te n
tru cks
to
ten
differe nt
pl aces,
brough t
the
musicians
in,
and
they
re hearsed.
Interviewer
:
 
When
he
wa nted
to
cond uct
th e
Mun i ch
Œ
Theodore
:
 
Yeah.

Interviewer
:
 
Philharmonic.

Theodore
:
He
could n't
get
the
orches tra,
beca use
there
was
a
strike.
So
we
made
available
tru
c
ks
to
pick
the m
up
at
various
points
and
br ing
the m
to
rehearsal.

Interviewer
:
 
These
wer e
German
musicians?

Theodore
:
German
musicians.
We
de cided,
you
know,
by
now
he
I
can
eve n
remember
one
of
the
pie ces
wa s
a
Ravel
pian o
concer to
for
left
hand,
and
he
condu cted
it.
Condu
cted
it.
And
after
it
was
over,
I
said,
"You
know,
we've
been
very
helpf ul
to
you.
We
wa nt
you
to
be
helpf ul
to
us."
He
said,
"Wha t
can
I
do?"
We
said,
"We
have
a
small
DP
orchestra

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0335

in
Wolford's
house,
and
would
you
con duct
them?"
"How
many? "
"El even. "
He
said,
"Sure. "
We
b r ought
him
out.
He
was
in
his
tux.
The
hall
was
full,
and
thousands
of
people
gathe r ed
outside,
the
grea t
Leonard
Bernstein.
I
think
it
was
ﬁPoet
and
P easant"
that
he
cond ucte d.
And
I
was
sitting
inside
watching
him,
an
d
his
hands
got
so
wet
from
the
tears,
tha
t
he
barely
stood
up
he
wa s
so
emotional.
And
ﬁPoet
and
Peasant"
never
sounded
li ke
ﬁPoet
and
Peasant"
ever
was
played.
And
it
was
over,
and
they
a pplaude d.
He
ca me
back.
He
pulle d
himself
toget her.
And
we
said,
"You
kn
ow,
a
lot
of
peop
le
didn't
hear
you.
Would
you
do
it
again?"
He
said,
"Sure."
And
everybody
mo ved
out.
Some
more
moved
in.
And
there
he
was,
still
cryi ng.
It
was
be autiful.
So,
when
it
was
over
the
peo ple
ga there d
around
and
kissing
this
ma n,
hug ging
hi m.
He
did
n't
want
to
leave.
And
he
stayed
ther e
for
another
hour,
walki n g
about,
talki ng
Yi ddish.
And
that
night
we
took
hi m
to
dinner
at
the
officer's
cl ub,
which
was
in
the
Haus
Der
Kunst,
which
was
a
large
museum
Hitler
had
built
for
the
new
Germ an
art.
And
the
army
always
takes
the
pre
s
ent.
So,
there
we
were,
and
it
was
rather
obvious,
an
American
Army
mess
with
an
orchestra
of
ten
people,
a
meal
cost
25
cents.
The
di rector
recognized
him
and
ca me
over
and
said,
"Am
I
bei ng
too
forward?
Could
you
play
us
a
piece?"
"Oh,"
he
said,
"sure.
"
He
said,
"Any
Jews
here?"
[laughs]
The
director
did
n't
know.
He
s a id,
"Yes. "
It
was
10:00
PM.
At
2:15
in
the
morning
he
finished.
He
was
getti ng
out
of
himself
all
th e
buil t
r
up
frustration
tha t
that
day
had
brought
hi m.
I'm
not
talki ng
about
how
good
a
Jew
he
was,
bu
t
he
certainl
y
wasn't
invol v ed
in
Jewish
affairs,
and
yet
that
was
Leonard
Bernstein.
That
was
beautiful.
 
Interviewer
:
 
I
nee d
to
ask
you
some
mo re
ques tions,
which
may
be
a
little
bit
more
mu nda ne,
bu t
I
think
they're
important
for
information
purposes.
You
me ntione d
the
prevalence
of
th e
black
marke
t
in
postwar
Eu rope.
Were
you
at
the
Joint
able
to
mak e
tha t
work
for
you?
Theodore
:
Whatever
we
did
was
something
that
th e
army
allow ed
us
to
do.
We
would
ha ve
never
set
up
the
program
of
distribution
base d
on
working
and
so
on
with
a
minimum
to
every
family,
if
the
army
and
the
UN
RR
A
had
not
allowed
us
to
do
it.
Th ey
kn ew
we
were
doing
it.
So,
in
effect,
it
wa sn't
black
ma rket.
I
mean,
we
just
di dn't
tak e
a
boxcar
and
say,
here.
A
boxcar
would
have
been
a
quarter
r
of
r
a
r
million
dollar s
profit.
We
had
a
case
like
that
by
someone,
too.
No,
we
didn't
condo
ne
or
allow
or
be
part
of
it.
What
they
wa nted
to
do
was
their
business.
We
weren't
there
to
police
th em
for
th e
Germans
or
the
mi litary
go vernmen t.
If
the
military
government
wanted
to
arrest
the m,
fine.
But
tha
t
was
a
gi
mmi ck,
not
of
our
makin g.
The
goal
of
all
th e
people
wer e
to
leave.
The
number
who
were
left
be h i nd
finally
in
1955,
1957,
were
small.
They
had
problems
tha t
they
couldn 't
immigrate.
Maybe
they
had
a
li ttle
business
or
whatever,
and
that
was
our
goal.
The
mili
tary
gove
rnmen t
knew
that
if
they
were
arresting
people,
putting
it
on
the
record,
they
could
never
i mmigrate.
And
bla ck
mar ket
didn 't
seem
li ke
a
major
crime
in
the
world
about
us.
So,
th ey
were
very
lenient
on
it.
Occasionally,
they
would
have
some,
bu t
nobody
was
kep t
from
immigration
be
cause
he
did
a
l
i ttl e
bla ck
marketing.

Interviewer
:
 
I'm
just
looking
at
perha ps,
if
you
were
 
nee ded
mor e
suppli es
or
different
supplies,
there
had
to
be
ways
to
ge t
those,
other
than
waiting
for
them
to
come
from
th e
United
States.
I
don't
know
if
you
were
able
to
you,
as
the
system,
for
you
r
own
pur
p o ses
and
your
own
goals.

Theodore
:
Well,
we
didn 't
deliberatel y,
but
cer tain ly
it
took
pla c e.
If
a
camp
that
got
their
supplies
decid ed
that
they
would
e nhance
the
menu
by
fr esh
fruit
and
it
cost
th em
a
carton
of
cigaret tes,
th ey
used
it.
We
did n't
stop
them .
But
th ey
were
doing
it.
And
that 's
how
the
system
so
r
t
of
worked.
But,
look,
the
mi litary
were
wonderf u l.
At
one
ti m e
in
Frankfurt,
in
the
mai n
cen t er
of
th e
city,
the
army
set
up
a
great
big
store,
with
two
entrances.
One
entrance
was
for
the
GI™s
and
officer s
who
coul d
come
in
and
be
given
points
for
chocolate,
cigar
ettes,
soap,
whatever.
They
got
points.
The
other
door
now
this
is
the
American
Ar my
 
th e
other
door
was
for
the
Germans
who
could
co me
through
with
whatever
it
is
they
wanted
to
sell,
Meissen
[porcelain],
chi na,
cam eras.
They
brough t
it
in.
They
got
the i r
points.
The
Germ ans
took
their
points
for
their
cutl
ery
or
whatever,
walked
over
to
the
other
side
and
used
those
points
to
get
what
the
GIs
had
b
r ought
in,
the
chocolate
and
so
on.
Th e
GI
took
his
little
poi nts
and
went
around
the
other
side
and
bought
his
Meissen.
That
was
army
sponsored.
So
the
army
knew,
bu
t
did n't
know
how
to
con trol
that
issue.
But
it
wasn't
considered
such
a
terrible
thi ng.
Interviewer
:
 
Now
when
you
talke d
abo ut
your
involvement
with
the
Brikha
and
tha t
you
were
able
to
help
the m
get
soap,
or
able
to
help,
I
guess,
get
some
money
to
them
to
do
what
th
ey
neede
d
to
do ,
was
that
official
poli cy
or
unofficial
policy?
Theodore
:
 
It
had
to
be
o fficial.
We
di dn't
do
it
on
our
own.
Ou r
people,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
our
director
at
th at
ti me
 
I
showed
you
the
picture
wa s
Doctor
Jose ph
Schwartz.
He
was
a
great
man.
And
the
policy
he
had
agreed
with
by
our
lay
leadership
in
New
Yor
k
certainly
was
from
that
end.
We
worked
very
closely
toget her.
I
wouldn't
hav e
bee n
able
to
get
te ns
of
thousan ds
of
gallons
of
gas
if
I
had n't
bee n
told
go
ahead
and
do
it.
I
didn't
steal
it.
We
just
we
re
n't
using
all
our
tru cks,
and
they
gave
us
so
mu ch
per
tru ck.
The
Ar my,
de ep
down
on
a
high
level,
u nderstood,
u nderstood
what
our
motiv es
were.
They
knew
exactly
what
we
were
doing.
They
knew
every
aspect
of
it.
And
they
were
sympathetic
to
it,
be
cause
like
that,
the y
could
have
stopped
us.
And
so
we
di dn't
set
it
up.
We
did n't
always
condone
it,
but
it
was
there.
 
And
in
the
final
analysis,
it
was
of
great
help
to
the
people.

Interviewer
:
 
Was
it
important
to
be
res o urceful
in
maybe
not
bre
a
king
the
rules,
but
bending
th e
rules
to
a cco mplish
what
you
needed
to
accompl ish ?

Theodore
:
It's
a
very
nice
statement.
I
agree
one
h undred
per ce nt.
I
have
a
story.
One
da y
I
received
a
cal l
from
the
col o nel.
And
he
said,
"I
have
a
question
to
ask,
and
I'd
li
ke
your
opinion."
This
was
around
Passover.
But,
you
know,
the
Or thodo x
on
Passover
must
cleanse
the
house
of
the
 
not
of
the
kh ometz
be cau s e
you
can 't
have
it
around.
And
at
some
point
if
you
have
a
store,
your
rabbi
agrees
with
you
to
sell
it
te mporarily
to
a
gentil
e.
And
so
he
said,
"We
raided
the
cam p
and
we
found
thr e e
floors
of
ration
food.
And
the
committee
states
the
following:
That
a ccord ing
to
Jewish
law,
no
Jew
must
have
khom etz
in
his
home
during
Passover
and,
ther efore,
they
br ought
all
of
their
khometz
to
this
warehous e
and
ch eck e d
it
in,
in
order
to
come
wit
h
in
th e
ruli ng.
My
question
to
you
is,
is
it
tru e
tha t
for
Passover,
an
Orthodox
Jew
must
rid
his
ho me
of
khometz?"
And
I
said,
"A b s olutely.
I
do
it,
too."
Dead
silence.
"T hank
you
very
mu ch. "

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0335

Now,
just
think
of
what
I
did.
I
didn 't
say
anythi ng
bu t
give
hi m
a
direct
answer
to
a
question
he
asked
me
beca use
he
wanted
no
part
of
it,
either .
I
cou ld
have
said
it
seems
im possible
that
a
th ousand
peopl e
would
give
their
food
into
one
warehouse.
And
obviously
this
is
a
war
e
house
for
 
I
kn ew
it
was
a
warehouse
for
the
camp
where
they
had
foo d
in
it.
But
I
didn't
say
an ything
bu t
what
he
asked
me.
So
that 's
when
you
talk
about
be ing
resourcef ul.
The n
ther e's
a
fu nnier
one
even.
It
had
to
do
with
a
cow
in
a
warehouse.
And
the
military
had
been
told
tha
t
somebody
b r ought
a
cow
into
the
camp.
And
so
they
were,
after
all
this
is
rationed
fo od.
They
ca me
in
and
were
looking
for
it.
And
they
cam e
to
th e
warehouse.
They
went
through
the
first
floor.
Not
ther e.
The
cow
was
on
an
el
evator.
It
was
on
the
third
floor.
So
when
they
went
to
th e
second
floor,
the
co w
went
to
th e
first
floor.
And
when
th ey
cam e
dow n,
the
cow
was
brought
up
to
th e
thir d
floor.
And
that's
how
they
had
ch eat ed
the
militar y
governme n t
of
a
cow,
mobile
cow.
So
resourcefulness
was
very
important.
Interviewer
:
I
assume
it
also
was
with
the
ille
gal
i m migration
to
Palestine.

Theodore
:
Oh,
yeah.
Th at
was
an
experience
which
had
so
man y
edges
to
it.
From
Austria,
the
quickest
way,
and
there
was
any
nu mb er
of

institutione d,
they
had
to
walk
through
th
e
mountain
about
a
mile,
and
th
ey
did
it,
childre n,
wo men,
men.
And
on
the
other
side,
th ere
was
a
tr u ck
that
took
them.
But
mo st
of
th e
mov emen t
was
h a ndled
through
bord er
ch eck point s,
through
fri endly
border
che ckpoin ts.
Also,
the
Brikha
coming
eastward
or
westward
went
through
Russian
ch
eck poin ts.
And
they
weren't
stopped.
But
somebody
had
bee n
there
before
and
had
mad e
a
d istribution
of
vodka.
You
can
just
i magine
th e
ki nd
of
planning
you
ha d
to
do
and
the
re sourcefulness
of
the
people
who
were
involve d
to
know
th at
a
train
carr ying
a
few
thousand
peopl e
comi ng
through
.
And
th ey
made
che ck
 
spot
che cks.
When
ours
ca me
in,
they
di dn't.
So
there
are
all
kinds
of
stories
of
the
resourcefulness
of
the
Palestini a ns,
now
Israelis.
And
it
was
 
th e
head
of
it
was
a
man
by
the
name
of
Chaim
Hoffman,
his
Hebrew
name
was
Yakhiel
[?].
He
die
d.
And
I
remember
a
month
befor
e
he
die d,
I
had
me t
hi m
in
Israel.
And
he
said,
"You
know,
Ted,
no
one
kn ows
what
ha ppene d
there
more
than
I.
No
one
knows
what
you
guys
did. "
Because
one
of
the
jokes
about
the
Brikha
is
that
ev erybody
was
in
it.
And
it's
tru
e.
A
lot
of
people
were
in
it.
But
basi cally
they
were
able
to
function
with
the
funds
that
th ey
receiv ed
from
us.

How
did
yo u
Œ
Theodore
:
Well,
not
r eal ly,
because
what
we
trie d
to
do
is
to
not
and
th
ey
felt
the
same
way
become
too
in
volved
with
the
people
who
were
f unctioning
out
in
the
field.
So
our

office
was
in
direct
con tac t
with
the
top
person,
who
was
this
ma n
Chaim
Hoffman.
And
whatever
it
was
that
he
ne eded
or
wanted,
he
would
come
to
us;
we
to
him.
I
don't
want
to
say
it
was
like
an
army,
be cause
the
peopl e
were
functioning
on
the i r
own
out
in
the
field.
And
they
all
came
to
this
poin
t
.
It
was
about
a
half
r
bl ock
away
fro m
us,
he,
who
held
all
the
wires
in
hi s
hand.
And
we
moved
dir ectly
with
hi m,
for
good
reasons.
We
were
American.
We
shouldn't
be
involved
in
thi s .
After
all,
we
were
in
the
r e
for
an
altogether
dif
f erent
reason,
to
bring
help
to
the
peop le
in
th e
ca m ps.
We
weren't
th ere
to
send
peopl e
un dergroun d
to
Palestine.
So
we
alwa ys
our
na m e
never
appe ared
on
anything.
But
their
needs
were
covered
directly
betw een
our
office
and
his
office,
whether
it
was
money,
whether
it
was
gasoline,
whether
it
was
tr
ucks.
Although
tech nically,
he
was
in
offici ally,
because
the
Jewish
Agency
re me mber
I
told
you
about
bringin g
teachers
in
the y
came
in
un der
the
aegis
of
the
Jewish
Agency .
So
the
IRO,
at
that
tim e,
ha d
hi m
as
part
of
a
voluntary
agency,
with
th e
Jewish
Agency,
for
Palestine
wives
[lives?].
An
d
so
he
was
there
legally,
and
functioned
from
there
with
all
the
commu
nica ti on
that
was
a vailable.
But,
you
know,
we
kn ew
wher e
th ey
were.
We
knew
what
camps
th ey
were
in.
We
made
an
effort
to
be
a
little
more
ge nerous
to
them .
And
th
ey
were
gen
e rous
to
us.
They
liked
to
try
to
pull
wo ol
over
our
eyes,
as
any
co mmittee
has
a
ri ght
to.
If
they
don't,
I
would
throw
them
out.
If
they
don't
want
to
argue
with
us
and
if
the y
don't
want
to
bring
up
pl ans
that
we
migh t
bu
y,
ge
e,
what
kind
of
committee
are
they ?
But
th ere
was
one
tha t
we
wouldn 't
take.
We
ha d
a
childre n's
home
right
dow n
on
border
near
Birches
Gaden.
And
one
day
ther e
was
a
request
that
came
up
from
childre n.
The
request
was
to
buil d
a
ritual
ba th.
I
took
that
into
Mr.
Haber.
I
said,
"Sa
m
,"
 
he
was
as
religious
as
I
am
"do
you
thi nk
that
childre n
need
a
ritual
bath?"
So
we
said,
well,
you
know,
they're
asking
about
that,
abo ut
$4,000
for
it.
So
we
went
over
to
Chief
Rab bi
and
said,
"We
had
a
re quest
for
mikve
h
at
this
home.
Do
you
see
any
rea
s on
why,
or
are
th ere
people
living
near by
who
need
a
ritual
bath?"
And
he
looked
up
at
me,
and
he
smiled.
He
s a id,
"I
can 't
tell
you
that
there
isn't
a
woman
do wn
there
who
may
ne ed
a
ritual
bath .
But
I
want
to
tell
you,
if
there
is
one,
I'll
do
everything
I
can
to
br
ing
the
m
up
to
the
next
ca mp
where
th ere
is
a
ritual
bath. "
So
it
was
not
all
fun
and
games,
be cause
sometimes
there
was
da n ger
in
moving
these
convoys
through,
because
at
one
point
there
wer
e
some
sca ttere d
shots
going
through
the
Fren ch
Zone
of
Austria.
That
was
cleared
up.
But
the
majority,
th ere
was
never
any
real
danger
with
all
th e
mo vement
of
these
te ns
of
th ousands
of
people.
Interviewer
:
 
Did
you
have
good
working
relationships
with
other
organizations,
other
aid
organizations
that
were
involved?
Theodore
:
Yes.
Well,
with
ORT
and
HI
AS
and
the
Jewish
Agency
,
there
were
no
problems.
We
cooperated.
We
saw
eye
to
eye.
We
ha d
th e
same
goals.
There
was
never
any
compe tition.
And
no
one
else
was
doing
what
we
were
doing .
However,
we
had
a
very
fine
contac
t
with
the
non
r
Jewish
agenci
es,
and
there
were
many .
The
Catholic
Relief
Services,
the
World
Counci l
of
Churches,
the
Quakers,
International
Social
Service.
There
must
have
been
fifteen
or
twen t y .
 
Interviewer
:
 
They
were
in
the
Jewish
DP
camps?

Theodore
:
No.
They
were
in
Ger man y.
They
were
working
in
Germany.
They
were
working
in
other
ca mps.
And
we
kne w
each
other,
after
all.
And
one
day,
and
I
don't
know
whose
idea
it
was
I
know
it
was
the
guy
from
the
World
Council
of
Chur ches
he
call ed
up
one
day
and
he
said,
"Ted,
we
are
going
up
to
Fran
kf
urt
to
talk
to
the
military
about
an
issue
dealing
with
something
with
the
camps."
And
he
said,
"I' d
li ke
to
take
a
lot
of
us
along."
I
said,
"I' d
be
ha pp y
to."
He
says,
"I'm
even
going
to
put
on
my
big
cros
s,
which
I
usually
don't.
"
And
we
went
up
and
we
saw
Lucius
Clay,
General
Lucius
Clay.
And
they
presente d
their
proble m.
And
he
was
sympathetic.
And
the
issue
was
settle d.
And
as
we
went
ba ck
on
the
train ,
we
were
tal king.
And
su ddenly
he
said,
"Why
don ' t
we
have
a
voluntary
ag
e
ncy
set
up,
an
agency
of
all
three
agencies,
and
mee t
once
a
mon th?
They
have
si milar
proble ms.
A nd,
if
we
want
to
go
togeth er,
do
it."
And
thus
was
born
a
coun cil
of
v o luntary
agencies
that
ha d
a
lot
of
clou t.
You
know,
it's
easier
if
you
go
in
with
a
lot
of
agencies
with
different
re
lig
ions,
rather
than
going
alone.
And
so
we
set
it
up
and
we
were
very
care ful
to
keep
it
on
the
right
level,
that
we
would
all
see
eye
to
eye.
And
I
r e memb er
when
I
moved
to
Austria,
we
se
t
up
a
volunt
eer
agency
there.
Whereas
in
the
Unit ed
Sta tes,
the
ki nd
of
kindre dshi p
and
cooperation
be twee n
th ese
agencies
mostly
was
nil .
But
over
there ,
suddenly,
th e
importa nce
of
religion
di dn't
come
into
it.
We
wer e
fighting
a
cause .
And
as
volunteer
agencies,
we
said
it.
We
set
it
to
a
com
m
an ding
general
or
to
an
ambassador,
that
we
are
a
voluntary
agency.
We
obey
th e
law s ,
but
we're
carrying
out
th e
policy
tha t
those
who
ha ve
contri bute d
to
us
want
us
to
do .
We
will
not
be
in
confli ct
with
the
gove rnmen t
or
th e
mili tary.
But
if
we
have
a
poli
cy
to
carry
out
within
th
e
rules,
we'll
do
it,
whether
the y
like
it
or
no t.
And
so,
you
know,
they
did n't
mind
tha t
because
they
were
also
a
littl e
con cerne d
about
how
thi ngs
were
going
in
these
ca mps.

Interviewer
:
 
You
wer e
tal king
earlier
about
almost
a
resurrectio n
of
these
people
in
th e
ca mp,
and
how
the i r
live s
began
again.
Theodore
:
Sure.

Interviewer
:
 
Can
you
talk
a
littl e
bi t
more
about
how
that
ca me
about
and
how
long
it
took?
There's
a
whole
sort
of
besides
the
physi
cal
rebirth,
almost,
of
a
lot
of
these
people
weren't
well.
Had
th ere
be en
a
spiritual
rebirth?

Theodore
:
Sure.
Well,
let
me
start
with
ri ght
after
the
war.
Everybody,
I
told
you,
th ere
was
so
much
move m ent,
so
every body
was
mo ving,
looking
for
their
relatives.
We,
on
our
part,
in
all
our
offices
painted
th
e
walls
white
for
people
to
put
the i r
nam es
up.
And
so
we
had
steady
streams
of
peo ple
coming,
looking.
Wha t
I'm
trying
to
get
at
is
tha t
there
was
something
in
them
th at
th ey
had
to
look,
that
they
mi ght
find,
and
there
were
few
who
did
find.
And
when
they
did,
you
wou
l
d
know
it
because
it
ended
always
in
screaming
and
shouti ng.
That
was
a
per iod,
a
period
of
unrest.
They
did n't
know
where
to
go.
Th ey
 
th e
organiza tion
wasn't
ready
for
the m.
They
a cce pt ed
to
be
pu t
into
facilities
by
the
UNR
RA,
th
e
un dergroun d
was
go
to
L a ndsberg,
wherever,
you'll
get
in.
And
that
was
a
period
of
bewilderment
for
most
peo ple.
Wher e
am
I
going?
What
am
I
going
to
do?
Despite
the
fact
that
he
was
living
on
the
bloody
soil
of
Ger many,
he
was
very
fortunate.
He
had
a
chavura.
He
had
friends.
He
had
fellow
Jews.
He
had
JDC

trying
to
he lp
him,
and
he
was
helped.
He
was
able
to
eat.
He
was
clothe d.
He
was
even
give n
a
job.
But
it
wa s
all
te mporary.
They
didn 't
want
to
co ntinue.
Th ey
didn't
want
to
stay
in
Germany.
I
hate
to
tell
this
story
be ca use
it's
a
li ttl e
off
beat,
bu
t
I
must
say
it.
Ther
e
was
a
comma nding
ge neral
in
Heidel ber g,
who
had
been
approached
by
an
UN RRA
social
worker,
talki ng
about
the
trauma
of
th e
DP™s,
all
DP™s
in
camps.
And
wha t
could
the
Ar my
do
from
a
recreational
point
of
view?
Bring
a
ban d
in
once
a
w eek
to
give
a
concer
t,
and
this
wa
s
an
old
gene ral.
And
he
says,
"Tell
me.
You
got
me n
in
those
camps?"
"Ye s ."
"You
got
women
in
those
camps?"
"Yes. "
He
says,
"So
what
do
you
want?
What
more
do
they
want?"
And
he
continued,
which
I'm
not
going
to
say.
Which
is
was
his
opinion
that
somewhere,
someho w,
the
norma l
reaction
of
people
being
thrown
toget her
mig ht
end
in
something
positiv e.
That's
one
opinion.
And
he
was
absolutely
right.
He
was
a
dirty
no
r
good
so
r
and
r
so,
but
he
wa s
right,
beca u s e
the
camps
 
wha tever
we
did .
We
brought
in
movies.
We
brough
t
in
players.
We
organized
every
part
of
th eir
life,
education.
And
also
there
were
people
with
children
that
had
com e
from
Russia;
that
had
co me
from
various
areas.
And
we
were
to
set
up
schools
and
so
on.
And
th e
chemistry
began
to
take
place.
There
was
no
matchmaker.
And
as
I
say,
it
suddenly
we
were
blind
to
it
,
fort
unately
not
too
late
 
when
the
commi ttees
began
to
tal k
about
the
fa ct
that
there
were
pairings
off.
And
the
Rabbi
was
telling
us
about
the
nu mber
of
marriages.
And
he
said,
"There's
no
rings."
And
that's
when
we
sent
som
e
body
to
Mil a n
to
buy
gol d
r
plate d
bras s
rings.
Interviewer
:

At
wha t
ti me
did
this
renewal
begi n?

Theodore
:
1947.

Interviewer
:
1947?
Theodore
:
1947,
becaus e
by
1948
we
had
these
th ousands
of
babies
all
over
the
place .
And
you'd
come
into
a
camp
 
where
they
got
bab
y
carriages,
I
don't
know,
because
we
never
bought
bu t
somehow
they
got
baby
carriages.
And
they 'd
come
in
the
camp
and
you'd
see
a
dozen
women
pushing .
And
finally
we
said
we
better
find
out
just
what
is
this
all
about.
And
we
didn't
get
very
far .
The
committees
were
no
ncommi ttal.
And
said,
look,
th ey
haven't
a n ything
to
do.
They
see
so
much
about
them
that 's
beautiful
because
that
part
of
Germ any
was
absolutely
magnifi cent.
I
hated
it.
I
went
over
the
border
to
Swi tzerland,
th e
same
thi ng
on
tha t
side.
It
looked
good.
None
of
our
social
workers
it
was
after
bab
ies
were
born
that
they
had
proble
ms.
Our
social
wo rkers
never
reported
about
what
was
per me a ting
in
the
g r oup,
or
who
were
ge tti ng
married.
We
never
were
able
to
figure
out
those
who
had
been
in
cam p
and
those
that
hadn't
been
in
camp .
But
my
own
feeling
was
that
a
great
nu
m
ber
who
had
bee n
in
ca mp
also
married.
Interviewer

I'm
wonderin g;
a

of
th e
young

who

f eel
they
lost
their
adolescence
in

years,
all
of
a
sudden
th ey
were

and
I

also
having
bab
ies?

Yeah.

Interviewer
:
 
I
wonder
if
this
was
a
difficulty
that
your
social
workers
and
psychologists
had
to
help
them,
and
I
don't
think
the s e
people
were
necessarily
prepared
for
adulthood
in
that
way.
Theodore
:
No,
now
if
we
thi nk
about
it,
it
could
very
well
have
been
a
defian ce.
The
Ger man
down
the
str
eet
tw
o
years
would
kill
me .
I'm
having
a
bab y.
I'm
comi n g
back.
It's
fu nny,
I
never
though t
of
analyzing
it
or
why.
Se e,
I've
me t
people
who
wer e
born
in
cam p,
and
I
asked
them
what
 
what
did
your
fa mily
tell
you
about
their
lif e?
They
say
very
littl
e,
very
littl
e.
Th ey
don't
want
to
talk
about
it.
As
a
ma tter
of
fact,
yo u
know,
ther e's
a
whole
organi zation
of
chil dren
of
surviv ors
who
have
problems
not
proble ms ,
but
if
they
woul dn 't
have
had
a
problem
on
this
issue,
th e y
mig ht
have
had
another
problem,
a
normal
family
proble
m,
that
mig
h t
be .
Of
course,
my
wife
is
victim,
and
my
daughter
and
her
thesis
at
NY U
wrote,
as
a
child
of
a
survivor,
in
which
she
disagrees
with
th e
premise
of
so
many
of
the m
who
had
w r itten
about
the
proble m
of
dealing
with
parents
who
had

in

We
also
had
Merita 's
[Merica™s?]
moth er
living
with
us,
and
they
were
freer
to
talk
abo ut
what
expe riences
they
had,
which
was
quite
uni q ue.

you

Theodore
:
Well,
we
have
only
the
Joi nt
to
tha nk.
In
1948
and
1
949,
the
JDC
in
its
in
fini te
wisdom
found
in
Hungary
a
group
of
Jewish
me dical
stude nts,
about
a
h u ndred
and
so me
odd,
all
of
whom
had
a
year
to
finish,
to
get
their
de gree.
The
policy
of
the
JDC
had
always
been
immigr ate,
ge t
out
of
here,
don't
go
to
school,
don't
hang
ar
ound
Germa ny,
Austria,
Italy.
It's
no
good.
But
for
some
reason,
this
was
such
an
unusual
grou p,
they
decid ed
to
gi ve
the m
assistance
while
they
finished
their
year
for
their
medi cal
degree.
In
the
case
of
my
wif e
and
a
friend
of
he rs,
they
lear ned
that
the
Muni
ch
University
Medi
cal
Scho ol
would
give
the m
more
credit
for
their
for
wha t
they
had
had
in
Budapest.
And
so
my
boss,
Mr.
Ha ber,
was
persuad ed
to
take
th ese
two
girls
to
Munich
[Mü n ch en]
where
they
would
finish
their
medi cal
school
in
Muni ch
Me dical
College.
And
I
ther e
was
only
two ,
so
I
was
ma
de
the
social
worker.
And
I
reme mber
exactly
what
we
gav e
my
wife.
We
gave
her
a
carton
of
ci garettes,
ten
bo xes
of
skinless
sardines,
a
kil o
of
che ddar
cheese
from
Missouri,
and
a
hu ndred
fr ancs.
That
was
it.
And
so
something
unfortu nate
happe n ed;
that
her
mother
wh
o
had
tri
 ed
to
come
through
th e
minefiel d
ha d
be en
arrested
and
was
in
jail.

Interviewer
:
 
Throug h
wha t
mi nefiel d?
Theodore
:
Pardon?
Interviewer
:
 
When
you
say
throug h
the
minef ield –

Theodore
:
Oh,
I'm
sorry,
betwe en
Hu ngary
and
Austria.
This
wa s
my
wife
ca me
through
that
minefiel d.
And
she
was
in
jail,
and
she
had
no
news.
Sh
e
di
dn 't
know
what
was
happeni ng.
She
ca me
to
me.
And
I,
through
a
nu mbe r
of
people
in
the
Joint
and
the
Israeli
Embassy,
was
able
to
get
to
her
mother,
and
to
help
her
in
food,
reading
materials,
and
so
on.
So
we
be came
frie
ndly.
And
before
her
mother
ca
me
out,
we
were
married
in
Mu nic h
[München],
Army
chaplain.
Sh e
always
says
that
the
best
thing

the
Joint
did
was
give
her
a
husband .
And
I,
vice
r
versa.
We
have
three
chil dre n,
a
son
in
Englan d
with
two
boys,
tw o
daugh ters
here
in
Ne w
York.
Both
have
two
children,
and
that's
oh,
yeah.
I
made
sure
she
finished
medi cal
s chool
and
got
her
degre e.
And
she
is
doing
resea
r ch
at
New
York
hospital
in
White
Plains
in
geria trics .
She
also
wo rked
in
Switzerla nd
in
a
geriatric
hospital.
Interviewer
:
 
The
 
share
the
aftermath
for
the
DP.
Theodore
:
Okay.
During
this
entir e
period,
starting
at
the
end
of
1947,
1948,
there
was
the
le gal
movemen t
to
Israel.
The
United
Sta
tes
came
through
with
a
new
i mmigration
act
specifically
to
help
displa ce d
persons
fro m
Germany,
Austria,
and
Italy.
If
you
were
a
DP,
you
could
get
a
visa
very
easily.
So
 
and
also
people
were
mov ing
to
other
countries
like
Canada,
Australia,
and
in
this
period,
we
were
also
involved
in
immigration,
the
moveme
nt
was
taking
place
.
Camps
were
closing
out.
We
come
into
the
early
195 0s,
where
I
think
there
ma y
have
been
three
or
four
camps.
And
then
you
come
into
th e
1955s,
and
during
tha t
period,
1952
r
1955,
the
Ger mans,
the
Ge rmans
wanted
to
be
as
helpf ul
as
possible.
I
mu
st
also
me
ntion
it
was
the
period
where
th ere
were
ne gotia tions
be twee n
th e
Jewish
organizations
and
the
gove rnmen t
of
Ge rmany
on
restitution.
So
ther e
wa s
a
lot
of
invo lvement
of
Jewish
causes.
Interviewer
:
 
Were
you
involved
with
that?
Theodore
:
We
are
par t
of
it,
yes.
Interviewer
:
Did
Ben
r
Guri
o n
call
you?
Theodore
:
No.
Mo e
L evitt,
our
director
in
New
Yor k,
was
the
secretary
of
it.
Wherever
th e
group
came
and
I
was,
I
was
involved.
Like
we
were
on
our
weddin g
 
fir s t,
in
1952,
and
they
got
to
Swede n
when
I
was
called
to
com e
back
bec
ause
restitution
was
starting
up
in
Austria.
And
so
the
government
was
interested,
really
inter ested,
because
they
had
been
ther e
so
long,
by
ma king
fa ciliti es
they
could
ge t
them
out.
And
the
gove rnmen t
was
very
cooperative.
And
th ey
ha d
 
there
was
a
lot
of
buil ding
all
over
Ger many.
So
the
fe
w,
by
that
ti
me
th ere
was
500
or
600.
So
we
began
to
move
up.
They
were
given
apartments.
They
were
gi ven
pe nsions.
And
by
the
end
of
1950,
they
were
all
out.
So
that's
how
it
ended .

Interviewer
:
 
What
 
how
important
wa s
the
DP
expe rience
in
Eur o pe
and
your
efforts
to
hel
p
th
em
in
ter ms
of
es tablishing
fou ndation
in
Isr a el?

Theodore
:
Well,
curious
that
the
JDC's
first
program
in
its
history
was
in
1914,
when,
le t's
see,
there
was
A mbassador
Morgenthau,
fa ther
of
Roosevelt's
Morganthau,
who
ha d
cabl ed
that
beca use
of
a
conflict
that
was
ta kin g
place,
or
skirmish,
or
war,
that
Turks
we
r
e
making
it
very
difficult
for
the
Jews.
And
th e
first
$50,000
that
we
raised
went
to
Jerusalem,
and
we'v e
be en
ther e
ever
since.
A
progr a m
tha t
was
set
up
eventually,
Malben,
was
set
up
 
I
ca me
to
tha t
pr ogram
in
196 3.
I
hel ped
cl ose
it
down
.
But
the
JDC
was
responsible
for
se tting
up
and
s taffing
and
fi nancin g
the
programs
for
all
of
th e
elderly,
in dig ent,
and
children.

Interviewer
:
 
So
the
ca mp
experie nce
in
helpi ng
peop le
rebuild
the i r
lives
and
th e
developme nt
of
commu nity
again,
how
did
that
play
into
your
futur e ?

Theodore
:
Well,
I
think
that
the
experience
in
th e
camps
of
these
people
was
a
good
fundamental
groundin g
in
what
eve ntually
they
found
in
Israel,
be
cause
the
imp
ortance
of
the
political
parti es,
the
impor tance
of
free
elections,
the
importance
of
a
cen tral
b eing,
state
of
Israel ,
never
been
the
state
of
Israel.
That
the
experience,
whatever
it
was,
it
had
its
effect
on
the
peopl e.
And
the
fa ct
that
many
of
them,
th e
minu te
they
came
there,
we
n
t
ri ght
into
the
Army.
It
was
coming
from
li ving
in
limbo,
which
it
was,
living
in
an
area
tha t
they
wanted
no
part
of,
where
they
couldn't
put
their
roots
do wn,
and
coming
to
Isr a el
was
a
blo o ming
for
the i r
lifeti me.
As
far
as
my
experien ce
is
co ncern e d,
I
cer
t
ainly
learned
a
great
deal
about
mess
and
housi ng
and
koshe r
food.
And
the
first
thing
that
hit
me
when
I
was
sent
to
Vie nna,
was
right
after
th e
H u ngarian
Revolution,
about
25,000
Jews
came
across
the
border
and
ca me
directly
to
our
office,
waited
in
line.
There
were
a
few
women
wh
o
had
dead
chi
l dre n
th ey
wer e
carrying,
and
within
a
very
short
ti me
that
probl em
was
well
handled
by
us
with
the
kn ow
r
how
that
we
had
had.
And,
of
course,
ther e
was
also
another
thing
th ere
that
chan ged
history.
I
haven't
mentioned
th at
immigratio n
was
not
an
easy
thin
g.
Medi cal,
you
couldn 't
have
TB
or
other
debilita ting
diseases.
You
had
to
take
a
security
examination
by
CIC.
Did
you
ever
watch
a
Communist
Parade?
Why?
And
it
was
not
easy.
It
was
easy
to
go
to
Israel,
but
to
go
to
the
Unit ed
States
was
a
terrible
ti me.
And
s
o mething
happene
d
in
that
th ey
didn't
chan ge
at
all.
In
195 7,
a
guy
by
th e
name
of
Ni xon
was
sent
by
Eise nhow er
to
look
at
it.
And
he
saw
ato mic
s cientists ,
and
he
saw
highly
professional
people
who
any
governmen t
would
tak e
quickly.
Look
at
what
you
s ave
in
having
well
r
traine
d
professional
people.
And
so
Nixon
suggested
and
fo und
a
loophole
in
th e
immi gration
law
where
pe ople,
without
going
throug h
th e
security
although
they
had
a
slight
medi cal
 
co uld
be
giv en
a
tem porary
entry
visa
immediately.
And
then
the
security
che ck
will
come
later.
People
would
go
to
th e
Am
erican
Embass
y
and
in
a
week
were
in
the
Uni ted
States.
Wai ting
for
visa
unde r
the
old
rule s
took
months
or
years.
This
was
an
exclusion.
Other
countr ies
in
Europe
were
also
qui ck
on
th e
dra w ,
would
bri n g
in
buses
down
to
the
border
and
tak e
ever ybody
tha t
came
from
Switzerland
or
Holland.
And
Nix
on
br
oke
th e
i mmi gration
standards
and
allo wed
i mmigra nts
to
come
in
easier.
That
was
at
that
poin t.

Interviewer
:
 
That
was
very
late,
thoug h.
Theodore
:
No,
no.
That
wasn't
in
195 7.
So
he
has
one
plus
somewhere.
Interviewer
:
 
I
un derstand
that
you
 
when
you
were
with
th
e
JDC
and
you
had
had
con
tac t
with
Oskar
Schindl er.
Theodore
:
Oh,
yes.
Well,
you
mus t
u nderstand
at
that
point
in
the
la te
1940 s
there
were
many
Germans
who
said
they
helped
Jews.
There
may
ha ve
bee n.
And
ther e
were
a
few.
But
there
were
a
few
students
in
the
W
hite
Rose
uprising
in
Mu nic h
[München]
who
were
standing
up
and
helping.
And
so
we
just
didn't
live
with
th em.
We
just
had
as
little
contac t
as
po ssible.
And
one
day
at
our
office
in
Mu nich
[München]
in
Se bra
Strasse
3

[?],
th e
receptionist
came
in
to
our
dire ctor,
Mr.
Habe r,
and
said
th ere
is
a
Germ an
who
wants
to
see
you.
Tell
him
to
see
Fed er.
This
German
walks
in
the
door,
tall,
rather
good
looking,
and
was
w earing
the
usual
Bavarian
lederhosen.
He
had
pan ts,
ha t,
feather,
a
ves t
with
li
ttle
flowers
on
it.
And
when
I
get
up,
put
out
my
hand,
Fe der
and
Joint,
S chi ndl er.
And
I
said,
"What
can
I
do
for
you?"
As
I
u ttere d
the
word
"you "
the
door
to
my
office
opens,
one
of
my
coll eagues
come s
in,
a
displa ced
person,
ta kes
one
look
at
Mr.
S
c hindler,
sc
reams,
drops
to
his
kne es,
kis s es
his
pants,
and
begi ns
to
cry.
And
he
was
incoherent.
Now,
I
want
to
tell
you,
I
had
never
seen
anything
li ke
that
before,
never
saw
it
since,
and
I
knew
something
was
up.
After
he
began
stopped
gasping,
I
said,
"Wha t's
th
e
matter?"
He
said,
"This
is
Mr.
Schindl er.
He
saved
my
life
and
140
other
people. "
He
smiled.
He
says,
"Well,
what
he
said
is
true.
And
I
come
to
you
beca use
I
nee d
some
help."
I
was
still
speechless.
I
went
in
to
Mr.
Haber,
and
I
said,
"Sam,
here's
one
German
you're
going
to
see."
An
d
I
qui
ckly
told
him
what
happene d.
He
said,
"For
Go d's
sake,
bring
hi m
in."
And
he
sat
down.
And
it
appears
we
had
received
info rmation
about
hi m,
that
our
committee
in
New
York
was
discussing
what
they
wa nted
to
do
for
hi m.
So
we
kn
ew
we
were
speaking
with
a
man
that
was
going
to
be
helped.
What
could
we
do
for
him?
A nd,
we ll ,
he
neede d
help
right
awa y,
because
it
wasn't
that
he
was
starving,
bu t
he
was
in
pretty
bad
shape.
Well,
we
sent
him
he
came
from
u pper
Bavaria,
Reg ensbur g,
I
thi
nk
no.
We
sent
hi
m
home
with
a
good
care
pa ckage,
and
told
him
to
be
in
tou c h
with
us
be cause
something
was
going
to
be
coming
in
on
him.
And
it
did.
And
it
wa s
very
simple .
It
says
th e
JDC
has
made
a
grant
of
$15,000
to
Mr.
Sc
hindler.
Now,
$15, 000
in
those
days
and
tod a y,
would
be
tenfold.
And
he
wants
$5,000
in
Ge rmany,
and
he
wants
his
$ 10,000
when
he
goes
to
Ar genti na
where
he
and
his
wif e,
who
was
an
agronomist,
are
going
to
set
up
 
not
a
mi nk
farm,
but
a
nu tria
farm,
going
into
business.
And
he
said,
"I'd
like
to
ge
t
the
$5,000
to
pay
off
my
de bts
and
maybe
buy
tools.
And
I'd
like
to
com e
in
periodi cally ."
Because
I
was
ready
to
give
it
to
him
at
th at
ti me,
he
said,
"No,
don't
give
it
to
me . "
W ell,
I
didn't
want
to
argue
with
him
.
Had
I
gi ven
it
to
him,
he
would
have
bee n
so
much
ahead
be cause
the
value
of
the
Deutsch
Mark
the n
was
pretty
low,
at
about
twenty,
and
when
th ere
are
twen ty
Deutsch
Marks
to
a
dollar,
and
when
he
finished
up
about
six
months
later,
it
was
down
to
ten.
Ok
ay.
So,
he
ke pt
in
touch
and
ca me
in,
discussed
nothi ng
ever
personal
about
his
wife,
his
son,
his
pla ns.
He
was
always
plannin g.
And
finally
he
got
all
the
money .
And
after
about
four
mo nths,
de cid e d
to
go.
Then
he
said
he's
taking
his
wife
and
he
has
a
family
he'
d
li
ke
to
tak e
with
hi m.
It
was
a
couple
and
two
women.
Okay.
I
went
to
the
ge nera l,
and
there
weren't
that
many
ships
going
to
South
America.
And
he
finally
got
down
there,
got
his
money,
started
a
factory.
Nothing
went
r i ght,
nothing .
Any
t
hing
he
tou c hed.
Two
years
later
Mr .
Levitt
was
there.
He
cam e
and
asked
if
he
could
get
another
$5,000,
and
if
he
did
he
could
get
th is
and
that .
Mr .
Levitt
said
yes.
One
of
the
oddes t
cases
we've
ever
had.
Anyways,
by
tha t
ti me
the
res titution
was
taking
pl
ace
in
Germany.
He
made
a
choic
e.
He
said,
"Look,
I
was
also
hurt
by
the
Nazis.
They
took
my
factory
eventually
away.
I
had
invested
a
gre a t
deal
in
it."
And
so
we
did n't
 
h a dn't
an
ans w er
for
him .
We
gave
it
to
the
resti tutio n
peopl e.
And
th ey
were
fascinated
by
it.
You
know,
one
ca
se
of
a
righteous
Germa
n,
and
they
 
I
later
said
you
guys
 
this
went
on
a
caprice
you
wanted
to
see
all
of
his
do cume nts,
which
he
drew
the
buil dings
and
one
thi ng
and
another.
And
the
result
of
all
this
was,
all
kin ds
of
important
Germans,
but
more
important
all
kinds
of
Germans,
tha
t
di dn't
li ke
hi m.
He
got
ne xt
to
n o thing.
And
he
asked
if
he
coul d
come
back
to
Ger many
to
fight
his
case.

And
we
said
we'd
pay
for
his
ti cket .
When
he
got
there,
he
said,
"I
have
a
possibility
of
really
getting
into
something
in
building.
I
can
ge t
a
concrete
man ufacturi ng
machine,"
or
some
bloody
th ing.
And
at
that
point
we
gave
him
some
more
money,
tha t,
too
And
his
lawy er
help
ed
hi
 m.
That,
too,
went
down .
The
only
joy
he
had,
and
he
went
on
a
num ber
of
times,
was
to
go
to
Israel.
There,
those
whom
he
had
help ed
treat ed
hi m
royally
with
hotel,
food,
liquor.
He
was
with
the m.
And
they
adored
hi m,
after
all.
But
there
wasn't
anything
for
him
to
do.
He
cam
e
ba
ck
to
Ger many.
And
then
he
got
into
real
heavy
bo uts
of
dri nkin g.
And
tha t's
the
end
of
th e
story.
When
he
was
buri ed,
he
asked
to
be
sent
back
 
not
back,
sent
to
Israel
for
burial.
Interviewer
:
 
In
your
deali ngs
with
hi m,
what
kin
d
of
man
was
he?
What
kin
d
of
personality?

Theodore
:
He
li ked
to
talk.
He
li ked
to
talk.
And
he
had
so
ma ny
ideas
in
th e
busin ess
field.
It
was
fascinating
to
listen
to
him.
In
some
way s ,
I
did n't
wa nt
to
say
it,
I
had
a
fe eling
he
was
a
first
r
rate
con
m
an.
And
pe rhaps
that 's
what
was
necessary
to
save
those
Jews.
Or
maybe
the
Lord
pu t
him
on
the
earth
for
one
reason,
to
save
160
Je ws,
and
then
the
Lord
left
him
alone.
That,
i ncide ntally,
is n't
my
idea,
but
it
was
told
to
me
by
the
fellow
who
played
not
told
to
me.
There
was
an
interview
with
him,
who
played
in
S c hindler
in
the
picture ,
the
what's
his
na me
 
Scandinavian.

Interviewer
:
 
Liam
Neeson.
[?]
Theodore
:
Yeah.
And
anyways,
that
was
his
story.
And
I
felt
co mfortable
tal king
to
hi m,
but
I
just
couldn 't
see
him,
bec
ause
when
you
thi
nk
of
what
he
did
in
pulli ng
the
German
Nazis
by
their
nose
and
ke eping
those
people,
no
one
 
no
one
coul d
ever
understan d
what
was
the
che mistr y
that
drove
him,
or
was
able
to
kee p
him
alive
with
all
these
mur ders
tha t
he
was
dealing
with.
It
be
g gars
descrip
ti o n.
Interviewer
:
 
Let
me
ask
you
a
qu estion .
Your
experi ence
with
the
DP
camps
in
Europe,
did
this
have
an
impa ct
on
you
after
tha t
period
that
remained
with
you?
Did
it
change
you
in
any
way?
Theodore
:
The
experience
with
JDC
changed
me .
When
the
DP
period
was
ov
e
r,
and
I
wa s
sent
to
Vienna,
at
th at
point
it
wa sn't
certai n
that
the
JDC
as
such
was
going
to
either
contin ue
or
expand,
and
th e
possibil ity
of
disba nd ing.
And
so
I
tried
makin g
contac t
with
other
organizations,
working
in
the
social
serv ice
relief
field.
And
the n,
of
course,
fate
had
it
that
there
were
plen
ty
of
e
mergencies
that
JDC
had.
And
I
was
able
to
build
a
fa mily,
and
wher eve r
we
went,
th e
family
was
with
me.
Wo rking
in
Tehra n,
my
back gr ound
was
very
important,
be cau s e
we
were
dealing
with
a
poor
group
of
Jews
livi ng
in
th
e
ghettos,
without
running
water,
witho ut
toilets.
And
we
had
to
set
up
a
progr a m
for
them .
My
experience
in
Germany
was
positive,
very
important.
I
could
look
at
the
34
kitchens
in
th e
schools
and
determine
whether
they
were
functio ning
or
not
functioning .
We
broug ht
in
staff
to
establish
a
substantial
med
i
cal
program;
experience
there.
Dealing
with
the
pe ople,
which
was
the
most
inter esting,
because
they
were
the
most
stub born
peopl e
in
the
world,
stil l
are,
taki ng
after
their
brethern,
doing
my
bes t
to
organize
the
co mmi tte e
in
Tehran,
all
of
my
finesse
in
Ger many
was
called
into
play.
I
didn't
win
all
of
them
.
But
it
was
very
satisfying
to
be
able
to
do
as
much
as
the
JDC
did

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0335  
31 
 
  
 
 
in
a
comm uni ty
wher e
ei ght
years
befor e
th ere
be
a
line
on
Friday
in
front
of
the
hospital
of
a
dozen
or
more
mothers
with
born
dea d
[stillborn]
chi ldren
who
ha d
to
be
buried.
That
ended .
We
cl eaned
up
ce meteries
where
Jews
who
were
Jews
us ed
to
live.
So
th e
experien ce
was
very
positiv
e
and
the n
ev entually
I
was
transferred
to
Israel
where
all
our
programs
were
going,
and
it
was
e xhilar a ting.
And
th en
finally
back
to
Geneva,
where
th e
hea dq uarters.
I
wa s
a
dep uty
to
Charlie
Jorda n
for
all
of
Eu rope
and
North
Africa
and
Israel.
And
25
or
so
years
ago,
he
was
murdere
d
in
Prague.
And
by
whom,
we
don't
know.
Th ey
were
tryin g
to
get
docu menta tion.
They
knew
what
happen ed
to
him.
They
cla i med
that
he
had
drowne d
himself.
He
was
there
with
his
wife
and
nep hew.
Charlie
Jordan,
drow n
hi mself?
It
was
more
of
being
drown ed
in
a
bathtub,
which
is
one
of
the
favorites
of
certai
n
grou
ps,
and
then
thrown
into
the
river.
And
when
we
asked
to
be
present
at
th e
autopsy,
they
said
sure.
The
autopsy
was
done
at
7:00,
and
the
chief
doctor
of
the
Zurich
comm unity
and
our
doctor
arrived
at
11:00.
They
did
not
see
th
e
autopsy.
We
di d
ask
for
some
of
the
inter n al
pieces
and
brought
them
back,
but
never
coul d
he
was
obviously
mur dered.
There
was
a
book
written
by
an
escape d
security
officer,
Czechoslovak,
in
London,
who
said
that
th e
Czech
police
had
watched
through
nigh t
of
glasses,
how
he
was
carried
out
of
a
ho
me
and
thrown
into
a
river.
But
it
has
a
peculiar
endin g.
This
doctor
whom
we
brou ght
in,
the
chief
pathologist,
this
was
August,
was
found
frozen
to
de ath
in
a
park
in
Zurich.
No w,
that 's
enough
to
push
me mories.
Never
found
out.
They
insisted
it
was
suicide.
He
was
drunk.
Interviewer
:
What
do
you
think
the
gre
a test
success
of
the
Joint
was,
in
your
stay
at
the
cam p,
not
in
all
your
exper ience?
Theodore
:
I'd
hate
to
pull
one
out.
But
I
would
say
that
our
work
in
Israel,
as
probably
the
jewel
in
the
crown,
bec
au
se
we
in
our
way
have
done
so
mu ch.
We
built
the
school
of
social
working.
We
establishe d
all
of
th e
buildings,
and
we
had
built
half
r
a
r
dozen
buil dings
in
this
program
of
Malbe n,
were
all
turne d
over
in
working
order
and
was
part
of
the
wholed
medi
cal
programs
of
the
st
ate
of
Israel,
all
of
these
hospitals.
Yea h,
I
thi nk
Œ

Interviewer
:
 
I'm
tryi ng
what
do
you
think
your
greatest
a chiev ement
was
in
the
DP
ca mp s
in
Europe
prior
to
that?

Theodore
:
That
we
were
ther e.
Eve n
if
we
ha dn't
done
as
mu ch
as
we
did,
th
e
fact
that
we
were
there,
that
we
represente
d
something
that
they
had n't
had
for
years,
that
we
showed
them
that
Je ws
in
the
wor ld
had n't
forg otten
the m,
wanted
to
help
them,
and
that
their
lives
in
the
future
would
be
more
or
less
what
it
was
before
th
e
war
 .
And,
you
know,
how
often
in
that
period,
walking
into
a
camp,
not
that,
you
know,
people
were
runn ing
up
and
kissing
th eir
ha nds,
on
the
contr a ry.
I
use
hu mor
with
our
people.
And
I
represente d
something
so
solid.
And
I
was
a
big
guy ,
too.
And
th at
we
li
stened
to
the
m.
We
did n't
tell
the m.
We
lis tened
to
the m,
and
were
part
of
them.
And
I
suppo se
that
giving
courag e
to
so
ma ny
people
migh t
have
been
th e
greatest
thing
the
JDC
di d.
There's,
in
th at
respect,
th ere
was
the
leader
of
the
Jewish
ca mp
in
th e
British
zone
of
Germany,
it
was
Bergen
r
B
e
lsen,
and
th e
leader
was
a
fellow
by
th e
name
of
Rosenzaft,
was
his
name .
And
they
spoke
a
little
English.
How
he
learne d
English,
I
don 't
know.
And
so
they
b r ought
him
in
1945
after
all,
here
is
a
man
that
ca me
through
and
he

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0335  
32 
 
  
 
 
was
present
 
DPs
and
everybody's
inte rested
in
hi m .
And
they
br ought
him .
And
Steph en
Wise
had
him
speak
to
a
large
group.
So
in
the
midst
of
the
group
he
said
some
unkin d
words
about
the
Joi nt.
When
he
was
over,
Rabbi
Weis
jumped
up
I
th i n k
it
was
Wese
and
sa
ys,
"This
is
terrible.
We'r
e
going
to
have
to
ge t
the
Joint
out
of
there.
We're
going
to
have
to
get
another
orga nization. "
Ro senzaft
is
listening,
jumps
up,
"Why
do
you
want
to
do
that?"
So
he
said,
"Bu t
you
just
told
us
about
how
inept
(they
are)
with
the
the
problems
."
And
he
says,
"Rabbi,
you
didn
't
un der s tand
me.
I
was
talking
as
if
they
were
par t
of
the
fa mily,
and
you
ha ve
a
right
to
be
cri tical
of
your
family.
But
if
you
do
one
thing
against
the
Join t,
you're
going
to
have
trouble
with
me. "
Now,
what
di d
tha
t
mean?
That's
it.
He
knew
that
we
were
ther e.
He
like d
arguing
with
us.
I
re memb er
once
me eting
in
an
airport,
and
he
always
smoked
cigars .
And
he
had
this
ci gar,
and
he
says,
"I
sent
one
ci gar
to
your
boss,
Mr.
Haber.
If
he
would
have
been
a
good
guy,
I
would
have
sent
hi
m
a
whole
bo x."
So,
there
it
is.
Interviewer
:
 
We
have
a
few
min utes
left
on
this
tape ,
and
then
I'll
put
in
a
new
tape
for
the
pictures.
Is
there
anything
else
you
want
to
say
here
that
sort
of
conclu des
this
part?
Theodore
:
Well,
I
think
that
the
epi
c
period
of
the
displaced
per
s ons
in
Europe
has
never
been
adequately
reported,
and
put
on
pap er.
It
was
a
glorious
page
in
history.
If
there
had
been
no
Israe l,
which
focus ed
the
eyes
of
the
Jew ish
world,
what
took
place
in
Germany
would
have
been
known
by
everybody.
And
it
was;
it
was
a
real
va
liant
pa
ge
of
history
of
Jewish
lif e.
No
one
expected
that
it
would
end
as
well
as
it
did .
Mayb e
that's
another
thing .
We
w o rried
with
them.
We
cri ed
with
the m .
We
wanted
desperately
to
get
them
out,
and
th
ey
felt
th
at.
They
had
never
had
an ything
like
that
before.
And
sometimes
we
were
stuffy,
but
at
all
ti m e s
we
were
there
to
hel p.
And
th ey
rea lized
that.
And
unl ike
most
peo ple
who
are
getting
help,
they're
asham ed,
and
th ey
weren't.
They
said,
yes,
we
have
a
r i ght
to
it
.
We
were
set
up
on
and
we'r e
very
gratefu l.
So
and
I
me t
ma ny
peopl e
since
who
had
been
in
the
ca mp,
and
man y
who
had n't,
whose
life
was
tou c hed
by
the
Jo int.
And
it's
a mazing
how
they
remember,
how
Eli e
Wiesel
remembers
the
bla nket
that
th e
Joint
I
mean,
that
is
true.
An
oth
er
woman,
the
other
evening
I
spo ke
to
a
group
of
women
who
had
been
helped
by
th e
JDC.
And
four
of
them
got
up
and
said,
"If
it
had n't
be en
for
the
Join t,
I
woul dn't
be
here.
I
woul dn't
have
gotten
my
medical
degre e ."
So
I
said,
you
know,
"It'
s
bee
n
a
long
time
ago."
Sh e
says,
"Yes.
I
did n't
really
know
where
to
go
to
say
thank
you."
Interviewer
:
That
must
be
very
rewarding
to
you.
Theodore
:
Pardon?
Interviewer
:
It
must
be
very
rewarding
for
you.

Theodore
:
Yes.
Or
we
have
a
tre men dous
program
today
in
Russia,
and
some
of
our
pe
ople
ge
t
overwhelme d
by
being
told
by
elderly
people
that
th eir
first
meal
after
World
War
I
was
through
from
the
JDC.
Or
someone
had
bee n
a
farmer
in
the
Ukraine
who
fled.
The
farm
had
bee n
paid
for
by
Agro

Joint.
Everybody
re

Fine
.
Although
we
must
have
made
ple nty
of
mistakes.

Theodore
:
This
is
a

that
appeared
in
the

Jew ish

in
1916.
It
is
a

of
young
Pole
Zionists
and
there
are
two

in
it
that
are
my

The

who
later
was
part

parce

of
establishi

the

Wo men.
There
were

And
the

is
a

Actually ,
that 's

And
she
was

Pardon?

You

Theodore

Okay.
This

the
"War

in

of
the
Unit ed

And
it's
an

of
Germany,
showing
the
hundre

and
hu
ndreds
of
camps
wher e
DP™s
and
re fugees
wer e

At
that

th ere
must
hav e
bee n
about
seven
millio n
refugees
and
DP™s,
who
were
eventually
re patriated
or

out

Germa n y.
The

is
a

the

of

Mr.

And
the

is
British,
and
her

is
Miss

And
every

this

was
visited
by

of

to

Golda
was
on

from

and
came
to
visit
her
dear
fr iend,
Sara
Fe der,
who
was
a
doctor
of

at
the
Univ ersity
of
Missouri.

Interviewer
:
 
The
year?

Theodore
:
This
is
1933.
This
pi cture
is
uniqu e
in
the
sense
that
it
con
t
ains
at
least
six
or
seven
British
gen er a ls
who
were
the
head
of
the
Unit ed
Na tions
operations
in
Germa ny
and
Austria
and
Italy.
The
Briti sh
that
took
over
leadership
role
for
many
reasons,
maybe
to
give
them
jobs
or
because
they
were
fearful
of
th e
possible
trend
of
Jews
going
to
Palestine.
Th
e
person
at
the
head
of
th
e
table
is
Gen eral
Frederi ck
P.
Mo rgan,
who
was
one
of
th e
`pl a nners
of
the
invasion
and
was
at
th e
final
cere mony
for
surrender.
He
turned
out
to
be
somewhat
of
a
probl e m,
be cause
in
a
news
inte rview
that
he
gave
a
few
mon
t
hs
later,
he
claim ed
that
the
Je ws
were
fleeing
Poland,
coming
with
gol d
and
platinu m
and
money
and
rich.
He
was
thrown
out
after
a
couple
of
weeks
by
our
own
Fiorella
LaGuardia.

Interviewer
:
 
Why
are
ther e
so
many
ge nerals?

Theodore
:
Yeah,
they
were
ge nerals.
This
is
a
very
uniq
ue
pictu
r e,
taken
in
Muni ch
[München]
in
1947.
And
it
contains
the
leadership
of
the
JDC
in
Eu rope
and
in
Germany.
Fro m
lef t
to
right
is
Herb
Katzki,
who
is
still
with
the
JDC.
Next
to
Herb
is
Doctor

And
Leo
Schwartz,
on
the
end,
was
our
director.
He
had
be en
there
for
a
year.
When
he
left,
he
wrote
three
books.
And
I'm
next
to
Mr .
Schwartz,
Leo.

Theodore

There
I

and
my
favorite

He

And
th is
was
taken
in
Norman dy.
And
I'm
sorry
I
couldn 't
show
you
who 's
in
the
open
tr uck,
because
it
wo uld
be
of
inte rest
to
the
fact
that
one
of
the
women
was
from
Norway
and
later
be came
minister
of
social
welfare.
Any
of
us
who
could
drive,
were
told
to
drive,
because
they
had
to
ge
t
all
these
tru
cks
out
of
Norma ndy
into
Ger many.
It
was
a
great
ride.
I
was

Interviewer
:
 
What
year
was
that?
Theodore
:
1945.
[Transi tion
to
next
picture]
Theodore
:
This
pi cture
was
taken
in
1946.
Th
e
person
on
the
ri
ght
it
was
in
a
displaced
person's
camp.
I'm
no t
sure
if
it
wa s
Feldafing
or
Wolfitzha usen
[Wolfratshausen?].
The
man
on
the
ri ght
with
the
glasses,
I
thi nk
was
Fr ank
London
or
Louder,
who
was
a
columnist
with
the
New
York
Post.
He
wa s
visiting
the
camp.
An
d
we
walked
th ere
were
mor e
kids
in
this
one,
but
he
was
ta king
beca use
he
had
th e
longest
payot
(P h. )
of
any
of
th e
other
childre n.
And
his
teacher,
the
man
on
the
lef t
with
the
payot,
wa s
asking
him
to
recite
from
the
Tal mud,
and
he
was
doing
it
.
Now,
th e
question
is:
How
fast
di d
the
payot
grow?
Because
here
it
wa s
1946,
weren't
even
born .
I
must
admit
at
that
ti me ,
I
di dn't
ask
him.
But
we
assumed
that
he
was
in
hid i ng
in
H ungary.
And
that
camp
als o
had
over
250
chil dren
going
to
school.

Interviewer
:
It's
amazing
that
he
was
able
to
be
in
hi ding
and
yet
maintain
Œ

Theodore
:
Sure.
This
is
a
visit
by
Ge n eral
Frederi ck
P.
Mo rgan.
He's
in
the
ce nter
there
with
a
white
bel t.
And
he's
in
one
of
th e
feeding
assemblies.
And
you
can
see
how
everybody
is
feeling
very
happy,
primarily
because
the
man
he
is
talking
to
spoke
English.
He
had
come
down
bec
au
se
of
"w e,"
the
JDC,
had
proteste d
about
the
bad
housing
in
this
camp.
And
he
was
th e
ge ntlema n
who
later
was
ousted
from
his
post
as
dire ctor
general
beca use
of
his
commen ts
abo
u
t
Jews
comi ng
out
of
Eas tern
Europe
with
gold
and
dia mond s ,
platinu m
and
money.
This
is
a
memo
to
the
leader ship
of
the
JD C,
Mr.
Beckelman
in
Paris,
and
Mr.
Haber
in
Munich
[München],
signed
by
Oskar
Schi ndler,
that
he
had
received
from
the
JDC
$5,000
for
needs
in
Ger many.
Bu
t
in
addition,
there
was
a
sum
of
$10,000
that
the
JDC
would
give
him
wh
en
he
went
to
South
Ame rica
to
establish
a
pr oject
there.
[Transition

next
pi ctur e]

Theodore
:
This
was
the
receipt
that
Mr.
Sch i ndler
signed
each
time
he
pick ed
up
money .
You
notice,
the
name
on
the
top
is
th
e
na
m e
of
th e
director
of
the
Joi nt,
Mr.
Beckalman.
And
then
all
of
the
si gnatures
on
the
ri ght
are
his.
We
trie d
to
gi ve
him
th e
money
all
at
one
ti me,
but
he
said,
"No,
I
want
to
tak e
it
out
in
sev en
install ments."
And
these
are
his
receipts.

Interviewer
:
 
Okay.
