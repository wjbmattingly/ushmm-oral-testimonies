  He worked in a bakery for six months. 
And the Germans ca me  out with a law, let™s sa
y when you were born this and this way, when 
you are twenty years old, you have to go to war. 
And they put him out 
and he was afraid, and 
this was like a--they got two doctors, German do
ctors.  It was a tremendous location.  Snow, it 
was the winter, it was no heat at all over there.  
I went over there one day, 
I want to see how this 
goes on.  Like in the army, they undressed and 
they went like a commis
sion, from one doctor to 
another. You na me  this and that where you work. And I told to him, listen, you can go free. 

Don™t worry about anything.  Everything was shrive
led.  He stayed for half an hour over there, 
naked to wait for the doctors.  Don™t think they 
will recognize who you are.  
This is what it was.  
He went one day to this commission, or to this
 recruiting thing, and they
 took him and they let  
him go home. After a couple of days, come  the 
papers and they assembled a couple of hundre d  
and they sent them to the coal mi ne in Czechoslovakia.
