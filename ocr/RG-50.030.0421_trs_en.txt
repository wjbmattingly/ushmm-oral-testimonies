HANNA BIBERSTEIN 
 October 10, 1995 
 
Q: I'm here with Hanna Biberstein in Davis, 
California and Mrs. Biberstein if you would tell 
me your full name and your date of
 birth and your place of birth? 
 
A: Hanna Biberstein. I was born Se
ptember 14, 1928 in Essen, Germany. 
 

Q: Tell me  something about your fa mily
 background, what your parents did? 
 

A: My father was the last rabbi in Esson. My
 mother was a native of Esson actually and my 
father ma rried her. Her mother -- we ll her fa
ther died. My grandfat
her died very early. 
Her mother had a store in Esson and my fa
ther when he was a young new rabbi came  to 

Esson and fell in love with her and they ma rried. 
 

Q: Where did he  come  from? 

 

A: He came from Wa ldorf, southern Germany a
nd he went to the university in Heidelberg. 
His parents, his father wa s a teacher in a l
ittle town, cantor, teach
er, rabbi everyt hing in 
that little town and there was quite a differe
nce between him and his parents because he 
moved to the big city and was 
sort of a modern person in ma ny ways. In his outlook he 
stayed modern even his ideas are mo dern t
oday, very open minded individual. Of course 
his parents were from a little 
town, very, very old fashione
d and we visited them from 
time to time but it was really a di fferent worl
d, a different culture all together from the 
way we lived and the way they lived in this little town. 
 

Q: Yoursiblings? 

 

A: I have a sister. She died two years ago and 
she was two and a half years older than I wa s 
and two and half years actually ma de quite
 a difference at that time in Germany. I 

continued going to a Jewish school, the localschool, and she went to a Jewish school in 

Kolon, a high school, and so our lives were quite
 a bit apart and quite 
a bit different later 
on in life. We were quite differe
nt I think in personality, too. 
 

Q: When did she leave for school? 

 

A: There were three of them 
that went together, three frie
nds from Esson, people her age, 
children her age. And they left at about eigh
t in the morning and came back by train again 
five o'clock in the afternoon. She commuted by train every day. Our lives were quite 

different because I went to the loca
l Jewish school still at that time. 
 

Q: Did you have a lot of religious ritual in your own home? 

 

A: We had quite a bit but there again I must sa
y my  father was a very modern kind of person 
and he really didn't force us to go when wedidn't want to go. I mean certain things we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0421  
2 
 
 
had to go like the high holidays but on the w
hole if we really didn't want to go to 
some thing or do some thing he let it be and di
dn't really insist on it. On the other hand, 
being children of rabbis or be
ing the wife of a rabbi is not
 an easy job because you're 
always scrutinized. I think the 
expectations of a rabbi aren't
 real and the rabbi's fa mily 
equally -- you're supposed to be a role model 
and be perfect and so if we did go to the 
synagogue and so forth it was expected that we behave especially well and be a mode l. 
Looking back I think being associated -- being pa
rt of a rabbi's fa mily is quite a strain on 
the whole family. 
 

Q: Was that imposed by your own fa mi ly or more by society? 

 

A: I think that's how it is because much, much la
ter in life in this country my sister ma rried a 
rabbi also who took over my father's congreg
ation actually and it wa
s the same . And I see 
it here even now with rabbis. 
I think the expectations are ve
ry great and you expect sort 
of perfection from everything 
they touch including the wife
 and the fami ly. Although I 
think with the wife it's getting 
a little bit better with the wi
ves now can have more of a 
life of their own and not insisti
ng that it's not a package deal 
entirely that they have to go 
on leading their own lives a little bit. 
 

Q: Tell me a little bit abou
t what you mean about your 
father being very modern? 
 

A: Very -- he wa s not a black and white kind of
 person. This is the way it's written, this is 
the way it had to be. He could see differe
nt interpretations an
d people varying the 
script ures or the commandments to go with 
the modern times and what they had to do. 
Another thing that just came to my attenti
on recently, when he was a young rabbi and just 
started apparently there was 
a discussion in the congregati
on between the senior rabbi -- 
he was the junior rabbi then -- the senior ra
bbi and the congregation 
about the role of the 
Polish Jews in Esson in that time and the 
senior rabbi was saying that the Polish Jews 
should assimilate and learn to speak proper Ge
rman and should dress the way the rest of 
the population did and that the way they we
re acting was bringing on anti-semitism and 

my father -- this is a newspaper article that I 
just got -- my father disagreed and said no it 

was all ri ght for them to keep thei r own cu
lture and that was not the thing that was 
bringing on anti-semitism and that it's okay to  maintain your own culture and your own 

environment. I think that's a more mo de
rn approach, more open mi nded. Open to 
different ideas, open to the world around 
you and seeing how Judaism fits into that. 
 

Q: How was he received by the community
 and his modernize, was that unusual? 
 

A: Well, apparently very well and  of course 
as a child what I reme mber is that he was 
adored by everybody because everybody respected him, but even looking back now in the 

articles that I read about it, that I have co
me across recently, it seems to have gone over 
okay with most of them. Now what he was able
 to do, the Polish Jews had their own little 

congregation because they worshipped a little 
differently than the other German Jews and 
he was sort of able to build 
to a bridge between the two cultu
res and I think that's a very 
worthwhile enterprise and was very well re
ceived and certainly served  everybody well in 
those time s. He was also very instru
me ntal in building what was a ___________ time 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0421

place for the young people, a big, bi g building that was establ ished oh about '33 or '34 for 
the Jewish youth in Esson. It had a big kitche
n, cafeteria, lots of room for me eting, big 
huge gymna sium and this was to serve the youth of Esson, the Jewish youth, but actually 

the whole community as other things becam
e mor e and more restrictive the whole 
community used that building extensively andhe was very instrume ntal in getting that 

done. 
 

Q: What about your mother? 

 

A: My mother was wonderful. My mother 
was what a __________ was supposed to be in 
those days, a rabbi's wife. She was a sort of
 a shield around my father, she protected him 
from any criticism or any adverse happenings
 and was always there to support him and 
her whole life was also the congregation and 
she grew up with ideas 
of the society around 
her. For instance, when we were small sh
e didn't spend much time with us. We had 
nursema ids and this and that and that wa
s what was expected 
of somebody in her 
position. It wasn't  really until we came to this 
country that we lived together much, much 
-- because we had to -- much, much closer a
nd we became a really close family. We  were 
not a close family, what I consider a close family in Germany because my father was 

busy all the time and my  mother was busy with ot
her things and we were
 sort of left most 
of the time to governesses and nursema ids, what have you. 
 

Q: Was your mother a strongly religious person as we ll? 

 

A: I don't think so. I think she di
d what was expected of her. I think that's -- and my father 
was very religious but he also had ma nydoubts about religion and that's  another way 

where I think he's very modern. He was not
 able to and not willing to just accept 
everything. He had his doubts. Later on in 
life when difficult things occurred, like my 
mother was killed in a plane crash and 
so forth and he had his doubts along with 
everybody else, like bad things happen
ing to good people kind of doubts. 
 
Q: Describe your home a little bit to me , the 
environment that you lived in. Any me mories or 
images that you have of your early childhood? 
 

A: My earliest childhood wa s we lived in a very 
affluent part of Esson and what I reme mber 
there is just a big back yard and it was a b
eautiful home and as I sa
id my mother was not 
in contact with us very much so it was more
 governesses and so forth. I think I was a very 

insecure child. When I started school it was ve
ry difficult for me  and I had a hard time 
adjusting to school. It was cel
ebrations -- the holidays were 
a very wonderful and a very 
beautiful thing especially I reme mbe r  the 
Passover, the _________ the seder nights. We 'd 

have a great ma ny peopl e in. They were mostly
 scholars and it was sort of a discussion 
kind of thing. Although I was only allowed to stay 
for the first part of it, that was alwa ys 
some thing I really, really looked forward to 
it. The Jewish holidays all together were a 
ma jor part of our life. A ma jor stress too, I 
must say. For instance, the high holidays of 
course my father, that wa s his work time . He delivered a great ma ny ser mons, especially 

on the high holidays in a very short time. 
So, it's not supposed to be but it is a 
performa nce. You have to deliver the goods 
so holiday time was not only a joyous time, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0421  
4 
 
 
it was also a stressful time  because that's 
actually when my father ha d to work the 
hardest. 
 
Q: Did you always go to his sermons?  
 Was the fa mily always present? 
 

A: No, actually we were not always present, 
and that was an okay thing. My mother was. 
My mother felt that she had to, but we  weren'
t always there, no. He gave us actually the 
freedom to c o me  and go as we chose within
 reason. Holidays or anything big we would 
be there but otherwise we  had sort of a choice. 
 

Q: Did you take on any of the reli
gious feeling or the sense of re
ligion that your father had? 
 

A: I think I did, I think I 
also took on his doubting at the same  time that I took on the 
religion. Unfortunately part of 
being the daughter of a rabbi is that you see too much of 
the congregation and I got really turned off by 
i nstitutional religion. I just  too much of it, 
but that's more in this count
ry than actually in Germany. In
 this country -- in Germany 
the rabbi didn't  have to worry about getting pa
id or anything like that because part of it 
came out of the tax money which was then give
n back to each religion so it was a muc h 
stabler kind of job. But in this country, ofcourse, he built up a congregation and he had 

to see that the money comes and all these th
ings that a rabbi shouldn't have to worry 
about, but in this country they do.So, I associat
e congregations sort of with a lot of stress 

a lot of in-fighting and not too 
positive actually I'm sorry to say. 
 

Q: Was he rabbi at the synagogue fr
om the time that you were born? 
 

A: Yes, before I was born ac tually and until we left . 
 
Q: What do you reme mber about the 
synagogue?   Were you impressed by it? 
 

A: Oh, it was a beautiful, beau
tiful place and on the high holid
ays the women sat upstairs. I 
would be with my mother and downstairs the 
me n were and they had high hats and they 
had their own places where they coul d put them t hen and so forth. It was a very, very 

beautiful building and very impressive and ve
ry awe inspiring really. I reme mber I guess 
it was one Yo m Kippur and you talk about who sh
all die in the next year and who shall 
live and so forth and so forth. I reme mber si
tting upstairs with my mother and getting 
very concerned and very worried and worryi
ng that she mi ght die soon and I kept saying 
that I hope that she would live until I was at 
least 16 or 17 which at the time seemed like 

an ancient age to me . And she assured me  that yes she thought she would. Yes, it was a 

very impressive kind of thing. It cert
ainly carried me  al
ong during that time. 
 

Q: What about your home life?   Did you
 play at home a lot with friends? 
 

A: We played at home a great deal. We
 had when we moved to the ____________ to the 
synagogue later on we had the -- the sexton 
downstairs had two child
ren that I played 
with a great deal. I think my
 sister actually had more friends. She had a great ma ny 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0421  
5 
 
 
friends and they visited back and forth qu
ite a bit and I think 
I was slow in ma king 
friends and had few friends but 
they were good friends probably. 
 
Q: Do you remember realizing at a particular
 point that your being Jewish separated you 
some how fr om ma ny other people in the town where you lived? 
 

A: Well, the first time that happened is when 
I was pretty young, four or five years old or 
some thing and when we lived in this nice part
 of Esson, the very a
ffluent part with big 
back yards and we liked to pl
ay in the back yards and my 
sister and I and someti mes one 
of her friends also and we  were playing 
there and the house next door was owned by a 
fa mily who had one son and he was usually pl
aying there by hims elf. So, after a while, 
after watching him a fe w days and so forth we
 started a conversation and he seemed very 
receptive and we got to be very good friends actu
ally. Then he got the clever idea that we 
should carve a hole in the fence so that we 
could go back and forth 
between the yards and 
we had a big sandbox in our yard which he liked
 and he could get at
 readily and he had 
sort of berries and things in his yard which 
we didn't have and -- also for hide and go seek 
you had double the area to play in. 
That was a great thing to do. 
 Then it went along very, very well and then
 one day we came down and the thing was 
boarded up and we couldn't understand so we ke
pt shouting Harmine, that was the boy's 

name , to come  to the window and he wouldn't come  and we didn't see anything. Actually 

we thought it was all a mistake that somebody probably the gardener or some thing had 

seen the hole and didn't know that we had permission from both parents to have that and 

that's it. It shouldn't be this way, I better 
do some thing about it. So, we thought it would 
be taken care of shortly. 

 Then a week or two passed by and we kept
 shouting for Harmine from t he yard and we 
even had the audacity to go out on the stre
et and yell for him. Nothing happened. He 
never came to the big window. 

 Finally we approached my mother and as
ked her to find out what was going on and she 
really didn't want to do that too much. She di
dn't like to interfere in relationships between 
children but she said a
ll ri ght if I see the la
dy I'll speak to her. 
 So, another week passed by and she said yes,
 I saw Mrs. Schmidt but she was just too 
busy. I didn't have a chance to talk to her. Fi
nally one day she came a
nd she said I did see 
Mrs. Schmidt and she wa s crying and she wa
s really sorry but 
she said what had 
happened is that Harmine had joined the Hitler
 Youth and at fi rst they thought that was 
fine and everything was all ri
ght and then one day he came 
home a fter a meeting and he 
said he just didn't want to 
have anything more to do with Jews and he wouldn't have 
anything more to do with us. They should righ
t away board up that hole in the fence. 
 Not only that, that his parents should have 
no contact with my parents and shouldn't say 
hello to them, shouldn't  do anything with them. 
Shouldn't talk to us certainly and if they 
continued doing that that he would report the parents to the authority. Mrs. Schmidt was 

in tears when she said that to my mot her 
because they had been -- not close friends, but 
you know, cordial, and said hello and chatted for a bit you know on and off and she said 

she's sorry. She was afraid of her son and of 
what he would do. So, she really had to say 
this is it. There was to 
be no further contact.  
 And of course I was aghast. Here I was still 
the same  person. My sister wa s still the same  
person. We had a wonderful time. We actually sh
ared very intima te fa mily secrets and all 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0421  
6 
 
 
sorts of things and all of a sudden from one da
y to the next there was this barrier and he 
couldn't speak to us anymore. It was beyond 
comprehension and I was really upset and 
it's some thing that you just -- I couldn't  figur
e out what was going on and why that should 
happen. 

So, that was the first time that some thing happened. 

 
Q: Had you ever when you were playing with hi
m had he ever said a
nything about you being 
Jewish?  
 

A: Never. It never came up. Religion had neve
r come  up. We never discussed it. We  we re 
busy -- he had a pretty good imagination. We  we re ma king up game s and different things 

and so forth. We  were busy with different game
s. Then he told us things about his family, 
what they were doing. You know how kids ar
e, complaining about the parents and so 
forth. We  would do the same , but there was neve
r any talk of any religion or anything. It 
didn't seem t o matter. 
 

Q: Were you aware that there was a difference between your family and Harmine fa mi ly? 

 

A: Not at that time, no. I think actually at that
 time my parents still 
had a lot of non-Jewish 
friends too. So, we were in contact with non-
Jewish people at that time . Our governess, 
the people who took care of us were not Jewi
sh. SO, so no I didn't consider the problem 
at that time. 
 

Q: Do you have further instances, further me mories? 

 

A: Well, the only other thing that
 happened while we were living in that house is my sister 
and I took piano lessons from a Jewish pia
no teacher who was supposed to be very good 
or so they said at the time and we had just 
started ma ybe three or f
our mo nths. Then all of 
a sudden he couldn't come  anymore and we as
ked what had happened and first it was oh 
well, he's not well this week and then it turn
ed out though that he had been arrested and 
so I asked my mother why would they arre
st somebody like that. What did he do, and my 
mother said from what she could gather he
 didn't do anything it was just that he was 
Jewish and that Jews were suspect and that 
they had arrested him because they suspected 
him of doing some thing subversive and so I di
dn't  -- I asked whether that happens quite 
often and my mother at that time  said wh
ile it does happen apparently my father was 
arrested when I was just a baby and apparent
ly there had been a le
tter that had been 
forged but had his signature denouncing the gove
rnme nt so they had arrested him for a 
day and then released him, but then again 
brought home the idea that being Jewish was 
some thing different. You were more suspect
 certainly and authorities looked on you 
differently than they would on some body else. 
 

Q: Did you have any understanding of why 
that was or any rationale for that? 
 

A: No, and I don't think I questione
d it except that that is the way 
it is. It think that's the one 
thing how easily -- of course I didn't know
 anything differently. I grew up in that 
atmosphere and how easily you accept it. This 
is the way it is. That's  all you know and so 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0421  
7 
 
 
you know you expected that to be the way th
e world runs. So, no I didn't question it. I 
just took it for granted that 
that's  the way things are. 
 So, then  well my parents also became  ve
ry uncomfortable in that neighborhood and we 
moved in the __________, the parish house which was adjoining the synagogue. It wa s 
really part of it. It was a bi
g building. It was a tr
iplex. three stories ac
tually. Then I heard 
more and more stories of my friends and frie
nds of theirs being b
eaten up on the street 
because they were Jewish and yelled at because
 they were Je ws or ridi culed because they 
were Jewish and so I began to realize that th
at kind of thing did happen and was afraid of 
going outside. Not that it happened to me personally although they
 did yell Jew or 
some thing and point across the street but I was certainly never beaten
 up or anything but 
just hearing that constantly ma de you very, 
very aware that the streets were not a safe 

place to be. 

 And our own life became more and more restri
ctive although I didn't realize this at the 
time, but my  parents had the good sense to see to 
it that we were more or less in a Jewish 
environment all of the time so we didn't 
come in contact with these dangers.  
 I went to a Jewish school. My friends were al
l Jewish. By that time  their friends were all 
Jewish only and they didn't  have any contac
t with anybody else. One of the nicer things 
that happened through this is
 that the people who helped 
us, our household help and the 
people who helped to take care of us had 
not been Jewish up to now and now we had 
Jewish help and most of them were young gi
rls who were preparing to go to Israel, 

Palestine at the time. This was part of their 
training to learn to take care of a household 
and children and all that kind of things. Actu
ally for us it was much nicer because they 
were a lot more fun than the people we had b
een with before so that was a very positive 
thing for us. 

 We went to the ____________, the pl ace for the youth and joined youth gr oups and there 

was a zionist group then that we belonged 
to and we had a gym and actually we had 
everything -- all the activities that other childr
en had we had parallel 
in the Jewish sphere 
so that I really didn't feel 
that I was lacking anything. I di
dn't feel deprived at all. 
 It was just di fferent and I must say I 
accepted it as most people and I don't think I 
questioned it. I didn't think it was that terrible. 
The frightening things were the streets. On 
the streets there were children who whenever
 I saw a crowd of child
ren I'd avoid it and 
go another way. Other children my age don't re
me mber that or other people who were 
children at that time don't  reme mber it as muc
h. I was very frightened of the parade. They 
were always having parades with different banne
rs and I've been told that as a Jew even 

when the flag, the German flag came  by you we
re supposed to stand still and salute and 
then I was told afterwards that as a Jew 
everybody else was supposed to salute but you 
were never allowed to salute. So, I was just
 petrified because the 
rules and regulations 
kept changing. That's some thing that stands 
out in my mi nd that I never knew what was 
right and what was wrong and 
that I was going to be caught
 doing the wrong thing and 
hauled off to jail and never heard of again. 
 

Q: So you would try to find 
your way around the parades? 
 

A: Yes, and not be caught in a 
position where I'd have to either
 salute or not salute, not be 
around so I wouldn't be caught
 doing the wrong thing.

 There were lots of stories that went ar
ound, more  and more stories of people being 
deprived of their profession or their stores
 being closed or sign
s outside that people 
shouldn't be there, Germans shouldn't buy there from Jewish stores, and this kind of 
thing. But they were removed from me personall
y. They were things that I heard and that 
I took in but in my own little envi ronment it felt relatively safe and okay at that time. 
 

Q: So were you able to forget then that this 
was going on for greater parts of your daily life? 
 

A: Yes, for mo st of the time, except when I 
hit the st reet s then I was more careful and I 
would keep in mi nd all the things that I'd b
een told. For most of the time it was what I 
considered a norma l life or that's the only th
ing I knew and it seemed
 fairly rich life. 
 

Q: Why did your fa mily make the decision to move to the ____________ house? 

 

A: Well, because also my father felt that he 
was being ostracized by the people and it wasn't  
safe. They didn't feel that in the long run 
that would be a safe place for them to live 
because we were the only Jews in that section. So, he thought that it would be a good 

thing to get out of there 
and more comfortable also. 
 

Q: How did you feel about moving? 

 

A: We all felt ba dly about it because the place we
 left was a very, very beautiful place. The 
place we mo ved to was in the center of town 
with a very small back yard. On the other 
hand it had compensations. It had a lot of room
s. It had a great big 
veranda that ran the 
outside of the building where we could ro
ller skate on top so it did have some  
compensations for the other th
ings. And my friends stayed the same  because they we re 
only Jewish by that time anyway so they we
re not neighborhood pe
ople anymore. So, it 
was an adjustme nt to ma ke but 
it had some  good points with it. 
 I must say through all the changes that we ha
d to ma ke in our life time our parents were 
very good. They sort of had the attitude well, th
is is just the way it is. They never looked 
back and said oh, how much better it was 
here and so forth and there was never any 
regret. Whatever came that was it and that's
 the way it was. I think we kids began to 

accept that as sort of 
our standard attitude. 
 

Q: So, you don't think that they were 
heavily depressed by what was going on? 
 

A: I think they were very heavily depresse
d by what was going on but 
they were able to 
ma intain a semblance of norma lcy in very abnorma l ti me s and did it very well and 

certainly kept fear away from us as much 
as they could. As far as giving up oh property 
or things like that well for a rabbi, that isn't an important  thing  anyway so that was an 

easier transition perhaps for us than it was fo
r others because we were really brought up 
to think that money and these things isn't th
e main thing in life. So, they made that  
adjustment. I'm sure they mi ssed it but not 
so that we children would notice it overly 
much. They were very good about it. 
 

Q: Did they talk to you about the laws? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0421  
9 
 
 
 
A: Not very mu ch and as I say that's  part of 
the thing that the fami ly wasn't  as close as it 
could have been over there. They were 
busy with their things and we were doing 
whatever we were supposed to be doing but not
 as much as later on when we came to this 
country for instance. 
 

Q: What about in school, we re you taught a
bout the laws after Nuremberg were created? 
 

A: No, of course I was in a very low grade and I 
think what they tried to do is keep things as 
norma l as possible. They sort of tried to 
hide the abnorma lities th
at were going on around 
us and to ma intain the normalcy as much as
 possible. So, actually what I heard was mo re 
from other children than any teacher saying anyt hi ng ever. 
 

Q: They would tell you what sorts of things? 

 

A: Thechildren? 

 

Q: Yes. 

 

A: Well, they would tell me mostly what 
I reme mb er was about some body being beaten up. 
Meeting some body and being beaten up by other 
children. Usually at that time that was 
the main complaint or ridiculed or  pants 
ripped down, things like that. But the teachers 

tried to sort of ma intain a 
semblance of nor ma lcy through it all. That's the amazing thing 
and I guess that's a survivor mechanism, you know, you don't  accentuate the abnorma l 

but sort of try to keep it as norma l or s
tick to the normal part as much as you can. And 
they did in school. They stayed away from
 most otherthings 
except the subjects. 
 

Q: Did you like school? 

 

A: Well, at fi rst I hated it. It 
was very hard for me  to adjust 
to school, to being away from 
home  and to adjust to school. Then I rather 
liked it. I wouldn't say I was crazy about it, 
but I rather liked it. 
 

Q: What sorts of -- what were your favorite things to do? 

 

A: Well, I liked reading. I was a good reader so 
I could read to the others. They called on 
people to read to the rest of the class 
and I was good at that. I was never good in 
arithmetic and that stayed with me . But r
eading and Jewish histor
y and those kinds of 
things I liked. I had a very good teacher most 
of the time. There were some teachers that 
had the reputation of being atrocious and used
 corporal punishment and all that in the 
classroom. This is an earlier time but I ha
d a ve ry good teacher who was very nice and 
very understanding really.  

 I rather enjoyed it. Recess wa
s the best of course as it always is. We  had a big school 

yard and we played. 
 

Q: Did you have any special friends? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0421  
10 
 
 
 
A: I had one special friend. As I said my  sister
 had lots of friends a
nd I was very slow in 
ma king friends. I had a very, very good friend 
in first grade and unf
ortunately she then 
emigrated to America so I lost her. That wa
s really a blow. That really ma de a great 
impression on me . People were constantly at 
that time leaving. Whoe
ver could leave was 
leaving. There was a leader of our youth gr
oup who was about ma ybe in his twenties, 
early twenties and I really thought he was the 
cat's me ow. I thought he 
was just it. I really 
had a crush on him and he left for Sweden 
and people were -- this community, this 
Jewish community was dimi nishing slowly as
 people were leaving all the time. Anybody 

who was s mart enough to read the signs corre
ctly and had the means of getting out, 
would. Many had the means of getting out but didn't read the signs correctly, and actually 

my father had the chance to leave, to go to 
Switzerland in about '34 and '3 5 and at that 
time he felt that his place was with the congr
egation and that he would stay. I think he 
must have also thought that he would outlive th
e whole thing. I mean I'm just guessing. It 
was hard to read the signs correctly because everything happened very gradually, bit by 

bit it became worse and you adjusted 
to each little thing very rapidl y. 
 Then of course the Jews have a history of
 being oppressed but surviving and so I think a 
lot of people and I think actually
 that my father was one of
 them didn't read the signs 
correctly. I think. Now, he says his rational was 
that he should have stayed, he wanted to 
stay with his congregation. That was his place an
d I'm sure that was part of it, but I also 
think that I never got the f
eeling that he expected to 
happen what did happen. I don't 
think anybody could. I think almost if you 
thought something like that was going to 
happen, your view of human nature would be su
ch that you'd commit suicide. I mean it is 

such a horrible thing to have happened that 
I don't  think the average person can imagine 

it. If you did, if you had that view of hu
ma n nature, I think it 
would be practically 
impossible for you to go on living. 
 

Q: I think there has to be a limit. 

 

A: Yes, it's just some thing that the human mi nd can't fathom. It's  beyond what we can 
understand and take in. So, I don't think he r
ead the signs correctly, and I don't really 
blame hi m for it. 
 

Q: Did you feel yourself that you wish you could 
emigrate after your cl
osest friend had left? 
 

A: I think at that time everybody did feel that
 they would like to. That was pretty late 
already. Everybody felt that this was becomi
ng more and more oppressive and it would 
be a good thing if you could go. And of course
 America was already built up as the place, 
paradise on earth. Although Israel
 was too, it was Palestine at that time, so either one of 
those was the dream worlds, but we weren't livin
g in the dream world, but it wasn't  at that 
point it wasn't  a horrible world. It was a 
world that was imperfect and there were 

depravation and you had to live 
with a certain amount of ha rdship, but it was not an 
impossible world to live in at that time . 
 

Q: What was the next ma jor thing that happens? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0421  
11 
 
 
A: The next ma jor thing that happened was the 
deportation of the Polish Jews, of Jews that 
were born in Poland and that was a shattering 
mome nt in my l i fe and certainly took away 
any kind of security that I had up to then. That
 -- I reme mber that 
day vividly. It started 
early in the morning and I woke up and instea
d of the usual breakfast being prepared and 
so forth I heard all sorts of phone calls. Peopl
e comi ng in and out and so forth. Then my 
parents said that as far as they
 could gather at that point, th
at they were collecting all the 
Jews of Polish decent and didn't know what th
ey were going to do with them but they 
were gather ing them and they were all in th
e school yard and they were herding them 
together there and nobody knew what was going 
on. The telephone was ringing as more 
people reported some body else being rounded up.  

 So my mot her informed us that there was 
not going to be any school. Actually there was 
school for my sister who was in Kolone and 
she had left for school already but that I 
wasn't  going to have any school that day whic
h was great. That my fa
ther and my mother 
and the sexton and his wife and everybody woul
d be busy that day and that I should go 

downstairs and play with the 
sexton's children. They had an old grandfather who usually 

stayed in his room but that was enough supe
rvision if anything terrible happened, he 
could take care of us, and th
at they would be gone trying to
 help the Polish Jews in 
whatever way they could. 

 So, I went downstairs to my playma t e s 
and they had heard of some body being rounded 
up and we'd throw out name s and we had 
no idea really what was going on or how 
serious it was. The grownups seeme d excited 
and seemed worried so we thought it must 
be serious but we had no idea actually wh
at was going on. We were by ourselves down 
there and lunchtime came and nobody showed
 up and nobody told us anything and we 
were wondering so we prepared lunch and fixe
d lunch and then things got to be very, 
very boring and so we decided to play hide 
and go seek which was our favorite game  at 
that time.  
 Since everybody was gone we could use the 
baseme nt of the parish house which also 
connected with the baseme nt of the synagogue
 so it was a huge, huge thing with tunnels 
going all ways and very, very little ligh
ting. It was really a spooky kind of place and 
perfect for hide and go seek. We  wer e n't really
 supposed to play there. That was sort of 
forbidden territory but we'd been there 
before and we thought everybody's gone, this 
would be a good day to explore 
all the tunnels that we hadn'
t explored in the past.  
 So, we went down there and played and I must
 say we forgot -- or at least I forgot all 
about what was going on with the Polish Jews
 or anything else that was going on. We 
were wrappe d up in our game s. Then we suddenly became aware that there was another 
person. There was some body else down there.
 First the boy, my friend, saw him first and 
then the rest of us saw it and we stealthily 
crept up there to see who it was and what was 
going on, who'd be down there. As we came clos
e this person turned around and he was 
frightened, absolutely frightened, petrifie
d and garbled some thing which we couldn't 
understood. We on the other hand recognized th
at it was one of our Jewish teachers, 
teacher from our Jewish school
 and we couldn't figure out 
what he was doing. He was 
just shoving and pointing the other way for us
 so we decided we better leave him alone, 
he's  not quite right in the mi nd. He was sort
 of strange anyway we thought, but stranger 
than usual. 

 So, we decided he wants to be left alone. He
 obviously doesn't  want us here so we better 
go and we thought it's probably time for us to ch
eck upstairs because we didn't want to be 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0421  
12 
 
 
mi ssed by anybody who came home  and so we we
nt back and couldn't figure out what 
this teacher was doing there and why he was 
acting so strangely and so frightened. We  
couldn't understand even what he was saying. 
 We  got upstairs and then the 
parentsof my friends, the se
xton and his wife came back 
and they were sitting there and they were ve ry depressed. They were tired too. They were 

tired and very depressed and 
telling all the things that 
they had done. Apparently the 

Polish Jews had been rounded up and they couldn't
 gather any of their 
things together so 
anything they could throw into a suitcase if
 a suitcase was handy th
ey could take, but 
they were only given five or ten mi nutes. On
ce they got to the school
 yard, they found all 
sorts of things that they were mi ssing, so th
e rest of the Jewish population was busy that 
whole day scrounging around trying to
 give them the necessities at least that they would 
need for a trip, which obviously they were goi
ng to take. Also, to get some  food to them, 
lunch and so forth. 

 Then, just before the sexton and his wife 
came back, it had been 
announced that all the 
Polish Jews were to go to the train station, 
to the platform, and they were all marched 
down there and it's then that 
everybody found out that they we
re supposed to be shipped 
back to Poland. Everybody was just devastated 
by the event. These were some  of our 
close friends. 

 Now, the teacher that we  had -- well, some  
of our close friends were caught in that and 
then the parents asked what we'd been doing 
and my friend said that we had been down 

there in the basement and that we came acr
oss the teacher, the Jewish teacher and what 

was he doing down there. The parent s became very upset that we had been down there 

and what we had seen and they rushed to
 the phone and called 
my parents and after 
talking to them my friends parents came  b
ack and said that my parents wanted me  
upstairs to talk to me . I thought it was some th
ing to do with being in a place where we 
weren't supposed to play and I went up ther
e and I already knew what I was going to tell 
them and the reasons why this had to be and 
when I got up there, both my father and my 
mother were there to talk to me and that was 
very rare that my father would bother to get 
involved in this kind of thing. 

 They had asked what had happened and I told 
them that we had seen this teache r acting 
very peculiar, very strange and they got ver
y, very serious and they said what we had 
seen was very dangerous if we
 would divulge it. It would be
 very dangerous, not only to 
the teacher but to our family and to everybody 
else and that what 
had happened was early 
in the morning when all these people were 
calling in saying that 
the Polish Jews were 
being rounded up and this family wa s rounded 
and this family was rounded up, my father 
some how thought of this teacher and was able 
to contact him before they arrived at his 
house and had said that he c
ould hide in the baseme nt. So, it was obviously imperative 
that nobody knew that he was there and that 
it would be very dangerous if anybody found 
out for instance that my father had contacted 
this ma n and sort of given him a sanctuary 
there for a little bit. 

 So, it was ma de very, very clear that under 
no circumstances should 
I divulge what I had 
seen and where he was and so forth. 

 I was just frightened to death, frightened to 
death of the whole thing realizing for the first 

time I think, I was realizing what had really happened to the Polish Jews because up until 

then I really hadn't fathomed it. It was sort of 
fi rst they were herded together in the school 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0421  
13 
 
 
yard and so forth and it was only after this 
all happened and they re
ally we re put on the 
train that I realized the tragedy of
 it all. So, I was overcome by that. 
 I was also fr ightened that some how in my sl
eep or some  way I would give way to what I 
had seen and that he was there and I just wi
sh I'd never been ther
e and the responsibility 
of keeping the secret just became a great burd
en to me . I was just hoping I wouldn't tell 
anybody without meaning to.  
 So, then it was then really after listening to
 the other parents and 
to my parents that I 
realized the full impact of what had happene
d to the Polish Jews. It was already late 
afternoon, it was Friday night, so
 we got ready for the syna
gogue and we dressed up as 
we usually did and I think everybody who is
 Jewish was gathered there and everybody 
was crying and trying to console 
each other. Now, this I don't
 know. It has been told to 
me  that my father gave a very stirring sermon 
sort of saying that the Polish Jews that this 
is just  the first chapter, that similar things 
would be awaiting us. I was really too tired. I 

think I fell asleep actually in the evening 
and afterwards when they told me  about the 
sermon I really didn't believe it. I mean the Polish Jews was one thing but to us, to my 

fa mily that that would happen I really didn't 
believe it or  coul dn't believe it. I think there 
were quite a few Ger ma n Jews w
ho at that  time still didn't believe it. It's just hard to 
picture that this kind of thing happens to you. 

 So after that day, there was no sense of s
ecurity that anybody had after that anymore 
because if you can take such a ma ss of pe
ople and uproot them within a few hours and 
shove them of to another unknown part after 
that we thought that 
things could happen. 
 

Q: Let's just go back a little bit to when you 
were at your friend's house, the children of the 
sexton and you had come  out of the baseme nt
 and you were hearing about all of things 

that were happening, were there a lot of pe
ople in the house and some body comi ng in and 
ma king reports and then leav
ing or how were you learning 
about what was happening? 
 

A: Early in the morning you mean? 

 

Q: Just after you had co
me  out of the baseme nt? 
 

A: No, it was just what the sexton and his wife 
was telling us and then what my parents had 
said what had happened, but apparently ever
y able person who had time was there at the 
school yard doing the same  thing that they 
were doing, gathering things for the Polish 
Jews that they needed, providing food for them. 
So, my father tells this story that one of 
the Polish Jews that he wa s helping, handi
ng him some  food s a id but doctor who's going 
to do that for you when your time come s?   I think my father at that time  realized that this 

was the beginning of the end. 
 

Q: So your parents actually
 spent a good part of the 
day at the school yard? 
 

A: The whole day. From morning until five or 
six o'clock until the pe
ople boarded the train. 
And so did the sexton and his wife and soI understand did most of the Jewish population 

that was able to take the time and help 
out. There were a great ma ny people and they 

were all with them until they were fina
lly boarding the train and then leaving.

Q: What happened next in between that time in
 October of '38 a nd then between that time  
and crystal night?   What do you reme mber? 
 
A: Just that there was great f
ear and I guess I was more leery of anybody that wasn't  Jewish 
when I went out. There was just a greater f
eeling that things mi ght go wr ong and I don't 
think there was a radical ch
ange except a change in how you personally felt, you know 
how each person felt. They had seen just great
 savagery done to gr
eat fellow Jews and 
after that they were not certain of their 
position, a great uncertain
ty and a great fear. 
 

Q: Did the teacher stay in the baseme nt? 

 

A: The teacher actually in so me  way and I didn'
t learn this until much later, the teacher 
escaped. The teacher is now living in New York 
City. He was in love at the time. One of 
the reasons I said that he was sort of weird, he
 was in love at the time  with another Jewish 
teacher at the school also. He was sort of 
a dreame r and we always saw him -- we thought 
he was composing love poems  
or some thing. We always ridi
culed him. The two of them 
are ma rried now and live in New York City.

Q: Crystal night I suppose would be the ne
xt very significant memory that you have? 
 

A: Yes. In fact, when I was writing the me moir
s I realized how close 
the deportation of the 
Polish Jews is in time to the crystal ni ght. 
T o  me  i n  my  mi n d  i n  my  me mo r y  i t  se e ms  l i k e  
half a year or  a year whereas it's a little 
less than a month actually between them. But, 
that's not the way I remember it. As a child I 
reme mber it just being a long span of time  

between the deportation of the Polish Jews 
and crystal night. That was the next big 
chapter and after that there was no doubt as 
to what you had to do. You had to escape. I 
mean there wasn't  any -- after the Polish Jews
 I still as a child thought well it's them but 
not me , they wouldn't do that to German Jews
. That was my as a child that's how I fe lt. 
But obviously after crystal night it became obvious
 that all Jews were
 the victims. We 
were at st ake.  

 So, that was  -- well apparently my s i ster
 reme mbers and I'm quoting partly from my 
sister's  me mories now and not only my own. My
 sister reme mbers that the evening before 
in the evening the my father got a phone cal
l and he tells the same  thing and it was an 
anonymous caller who some how wa rned him 
that during the night there would be 
parades. There would be a procession and 
there would be ma rches and that some how 
they were going to be against the Jews and 
that the building, the synagogue mi ght be in 
danger. That's all that they said.  
 

Q: Did you know anything a
bout Hershel Greenspan? 

 

A: I did not, no, I did not at th
e time . So, as I say in a way my
 parents protected me  and the 
environment. Everybody else protected me  ma yb
e too much but we were quite protected 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0421  
15 
 
 
and things that would upset us greatly or ma ke 
us very fearful were re
ally talked about as 
little as possible. So, I did not know. 
 Apparently my father got this phone ca
ll during our meal time  and came back very 
agitated and the meal continued and then my 
mother told us that a good friend of hers 

who was also a -- who took a very special in
terest in me  or a nurse by the name  of 
_______________, was going to spend the night with 
us. We  went to bed as usual and 
nothing much really occurred. My father tell
s later on that after the phone call he didn't 
know quite whether to be lieve  it or  not because there had been so ma ny false warnings. 

People were always imagining things some ti me s there were real dangers involved but 

there were a lot of warnings and a lot of them tur ned out to be false. So, he obviously 

didn't believe that the things
 would go the way they did. 
 On the other hand, he took some  pre cautions. He asked this friend of ours to come  and 

stay with us and there was a beggar who 
lived all the way up in the dome of the 
synagogue and he went up there about three or 
four times a week and slept up there. The 
stories that I was told as a child was that 
he was really a very rich ma n that he was 
hoarding all those things up th
ere. I was never up there and 
I don't even know how he got 
up there but apparently he came that evening 
and they told him not to go up there. So I 

think they half believed it and 
half didn't believe it. If he 
would have believed it all the 
way he obviously wouldn't  have kept his family
 in the house. So, it was sort of a mi xture 
between taking some  pre cautions 
but not going over
board with it. 
 Then during the night there was a lot of noise
 and when I woke up the lights were on and 
my mother came in and said that the gesta
po went in the house andwe had to leave the 
house and that my sister and I should get dres
sed right away and ge
t ready to leave and 
that she would be downstairs. We  wereon the third floor. The bedrooms were on the 

third floor. My father's  study was on the s
econd floor and the sexton lived on the first 
floor. 
 And she would be on the second floor with my
 father and I think I was in a state of 
shock when the whole thing happened because 
I just followed orders. I was supposed to 
get dressed and we were s
upposed to leave the house. 
 Now, my understanding at the time was th
at we would leave the house and we would 
come  back. I had no idea -- crazy orders like 
that were the norm so I didn't question it. 
Okay, so they wanted us to leave, okay, a
nd then obviously we  would come  back. So, we 
got dressed and we were in no special hurry ac
tually. My sister and I in fact this was 
Nove mber and some  of our Hanukkah pres
ents had already arrived from my 
grandmother's store and my sister knew that
 her very nice shirts were up on the top 
shelves where we weren't supposed to get at
 them. When she was getting dressed since 
we were going to leave she got a chair, pulled down the package, put on that nice shirt 

and everything else. People would come  in and 
say we have to leave and we said yes, yes 
we'll have to leave. That's  fine. We 'r e  getting ready.  

 I personally was sort of waiting for my parents to
 come  and to take us or tell us what to 

do and they weren't coming and there was a lot 
of noise downstairs. My father apparently 

was with my  mother and the gestapo and fi
nally the sexton ran up and said okay you've 

got to go, the place is burning, get out. And 
so I don't even reme mber it. I reme mber 
being shoved. I did not want to leave because
 I thought my parents were still someplace 
in the building and I wasn't  going to go without
 them. They finally kept pushing me  and 

pushing me  to the steps and then when we got
 to the second story, second floor there was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0421  
16 
 
 
an SS person and he was just smashing everyt
hing in sight. We ha
d glass doors and glass 
windows and a lot of figurines and he was ju
st smashing things and kicking things and 
our orders though they kept pushing no no you've 
got to go, you've got to get out of here. 
So, we ran down -- as we were going down to the bottom floor, we saw the flames fr om 
the synagogue comi ng over to our staircase a
nd they were already on the staircase as we 
were going down. And down on the first floor 
also was the sexton's father, the old 
gentlema n who always lived with them and 
he was in his long white nightgown just 
standing there petrified. They did the same  th
ing with him that they did with me , they 
were just pushing him out the door. 

 Then one of the most frightening things 
was as we came out side, they were paving the 

streets with these cobblestones and they we
re throwing these stone
s through the windows 
and the sexton and fa mily apparently when th
ey first heard the ge
stapo comi ng and were 
told that they had to leave had ordered some
 taxis for us and the taxis were across the 
street. Some how we had to get across th
at st reet where they were throwing the 
cobblestones and not get hit by them. I was ju
st frightened to deat
h and there was no way 
that I could see or that we
 could see doing that and they
 kept throwing and suddenly 
some body s a id they'r e just children, let them
 go. And they did stop and we crossed the 
street and they resume d right away to throw the 
things so we were able
 to cross the street 
which when we were standing there with al
l those stones comi ng right where we had to 
walk across seemed like an impossible thing. 

 Then I was still unwilling to 
really let go because 
I really thought that my  parents were 
in that building still but when we got to the 
taxi there they were. They had come  out by 
another exit and so we all went to the Jewish
 nurse's home  where there were three Jewish 
nurses living together, and the sexton's  fa
mily a nd us we went there and we were 
absolutely -- as I say, I still think I had not
 taken in, even though I lived through it, I 
didn't really live through it until 
about a day afterwards until 
it sank in what had really 
happened. I was sort of pushed this way and 
pushed that way and I reme mber -- the only 
thing I really reme mber, there were two things
 I reme mber as being terribly frightening. 
The one thing was that I thought that my pare
nts were still in the house, and the second 
thing was the cobblestones and how to get to th
e other side of the st
reet and not get hit 
and those are the two things that vividly stand ou
t but the rest of it I think I was just like a 
sort of robot, was doing what I was told to do 
but not really taking in
 too much of what 
was going on. 

 Then the taxis took us to the nurse's home . Th
en in the course of the day we heard that 
the synagogue was just the first Jewish hous
e to be destroyed but they were going to 

every Jewish home  in Esson and taking the ma les and taking them off to concentration 

camps. Often destroying the whole house, of
ten injuring the people and so when these 
reports came in my father realized that wh
at he should do -- since they didn't know where 

he was because he had escaped, we had left 
the building before the or der to arrest all 
Jewish me n had come  through, so they didn't know where he was and he took off and for 

the next two weeks he was gone. He was actually 
in different consulates
 in different cities 
and would call in from time to ti me that he wa
s okay but he was stil
l not arrested. So, he 
was gone and we were sitting there and as more
 and more reports came in we felt that -- 
and I especially got very fr
ightened then and thought oka
y, they did our house but they 
haven't been to the nurse's home yet. They ha
ven't been here, so when are they going to 
come , and what are they going to do this time 
when they come  because one of the stories 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0421

that st ill sticks out in my mi nd is that 
one some body in Esson whose home  they had 
visited and the husband when he came  out a
nd said what are you doing here or some thing 
like that they took a pencil and 
stuck it through his eyeball and th
at me mo ry still is in my 
mi nd somet hing vivid like that
. We  heard other stories and so it was very, very difficult 
for me  when night time  came to go to bed a
nd I had nightma res and it was really got to 
the point  that  I was thinki ng in the evenings 
okay let them come, let's get it over with. It's 
done. They'll only visit this place once and wh
en it's done, it's done and it was very hard 
for anybody to reassure me  that
 we would not be visited.  
 My mother and the sexton's fa mily and I guess 
a lot of other Jewish families tried to call 
the police from time to time, very naive but
 you try anything you can and the police we re 
considered the good guys as compared to the 
SS and to see what houses were on the list 
for that night. Of course they could get 
no answers and could get no protection but they 
tried. I reme mber every evening them dialing 
the police and trying to 
find out. This went 
on for about a week or more and as I say I wa
s just petrified -- it seemed having that in 
front of you seemed muc h worse to me , much
 more fearful than having gone through it 
when I was sort of in neutral and really 
didn't take it in, what was happening. But once I 
realized what had happened and then having to 
face that again some  of the things that I 
had heard just seemed unbearable. So, all of us
 were living there together . There were ten 
of us by then living together 
in a place meant for three so
 we were all doubling up in 
beds, doubling up everywhere and everybody on edge. It was a very, very difficult time. 
 

Q: Were you reflecting on what had happened th
at night and learning 
from your parents, 
from your sister the different experiences 
that each of you had had, or were you quiet? 
 

A: Actually, I think that I got some  of t hese 
stories about what had ha
ppened with my father 
and my mother when they were downstairs w
ith the SI, my mother told us how they 
goaded my father and said well what do you th
ink about this?   Your
 beautiful synagogue 
going up in flames and they were half drunk and to my mother they seeme d very 

dangerous which is the reason that she stayed with him.  

 I guess one asked him for a book, would he cons
ider to give him a book that my fathe r  
would think worthwhile for this SI man to ha
ve and they could never figure out whether 
the SI ma n was serious in that or whether he
 was being sarcastic a
nd I think my mother 
could never figure out.  

 So, we shared some  of these 
--I told my mother 
of course what had gone on with us so 
all that was shared at that time. In the l
ong run, people reme mbered the story differently. 

There were four of us in the family and 
each one ha s four different reme mb rances of 
what happened, but that's not unusual. The ma in facts rema in the same , but they'r e 

slightly different. 
 

Q: What did you think of these people who we
re destroying your home?   Were you able to 
think of them as being huma n? 
 

A: Not huma n, no. I did not think of them as 
huma n. No, I did not think of them as being 
huma n not at all. Some  kind of anima l . That
 was just beyond everything. In fact, I didn't  

think of the Nazis afterwards as human. I rea
lly didn't. No huma n being that I had ever 
me t could do things like that or would do things
 like that . A different species all together.

Q: For the next several weeks then 
you lived in this very small space? 
 

A: From Nove mber until March and that was 
a very tryi ng time for everybody. My father 
returned after they were not arresting people 
anymore. It was a very trying time because 
there were ten of us living there in a place 
that wa s meant for three. Everybody was very 
tense. Everybody was terribly worried. I reme
mb er vaguely that there were squabbles 
about who could use the tele
phone because everybody needed 
the telephone. We  were all 
trying to get out of the country. The need to 
rescue ourselves, our fa milies, and there was 
tension about who could us
e the phone when, and who was using the phone too much, 
and who was going to cook and even adjusting 
to all these things 
in very unfavorable 
conditions. I mean everybody was not at their 
best. Everybody was ver
y, very uptight and 
tense. 

 It was a very difficult time. Also school
 went on but it was only a few hours a day 
because some  of the teachers had gone, a lo
t of the children ha d gone, so there was a lot 
of free time for us kids, free time  and not much to do and the adults were busy. They 

were trying to ma ke arrangeme nts to get out 
of this country. My father was busy ma king 
arrangements for other people also to get out
 of the country and so
 they were taken up 
with other things. We  couldn't go out on the st
reet and play on the street. There was no 
backyard. The streets we ren't safe for us obvi
ously and the pl ace inside was very small, 
so there really wasn't  mu ch to do so there 
were a lot of squabbles among us kids too and 
we devised a way sort of me diation, if you get 
into a fight with this one, you go to this 
one first, and this one first and the parents were
 then the last resort. To keep us occupied 
since we didn't  have school, what we want
ed was some thing to do, some  job where we 
could earn some  money too. My
 job was to polish the shoe
s for everybody in the house 
every day and then I got some  allowances so
me thing at the end, but 
at least it took time 
and kept us busy and I think the adults we
re hard put to keeping everybody busy and 
occupied at a time like that. 

 My parents were busy with the trying to get 
out of the country. I re
me mb er also that the 
people who were arrested crystal night were th
en, most of them were
 released within a 
few weeks, but they came back in terrible 
condition. Their headshad been shaven and 
stubble and you know wounds, they
 looked really as if they had been mi shandled. 
 I reme mber one of them that was a relati
ve of the sexton comi ng to the house. He had 

just gotten out of the concentration camp 
and he was going to come , and I know how I 
felt before I saw him, I thought oh I'm going to
 just go up there and give him a great big 
hug and kiss. Then I saw him with shaven head
 and so I was just a
ppalled. I was really 
taken aback. I did not go up and kiss him. I just couldn't. I was just shocked at the way he 

looked. 
 

Q: Do you remember ga me s that you played? 

 

A: During that time , I really don't. No, I don't 
know i f it was anything different than we had 
done before. It was a very restrictive time a
nd I think we did a lot of reading and quiet 
things were looked upon very 
favorably in that surrounding. 
 The thing that kept me  going was that 
everybody shared a bed with somebody else 
because there obviously weren't enough beds to
 go around and this head nurse who had 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0421  
19 
 
 
been my fr iend fr om the time I was very small 
little girl, I used to spend weekends with 
her and so forth, and I shared her big feather 
bed with her and that 
always ma de me  feel 
more secure than I did at any other time  that
 I was there with her. We played game s -- she 
played games with me. She in her feather 
bed she would build caves and have people 
comi ng through very imaginative kinds of things
 that she would do to keep me  occupied. 
We were on the same  wave length sort of. 
 

Q: Did that give you a
ny hope, that security? 
 

A: Not hope, but it helped me  to go to slee
p. It ma de me  feel more comfortable. 
 

Q: Did you have hope?   We re you focused on ge
tting out of the count
ry at that time ?  
 

A: Yes, comple tely. We ll, I think everybody real
ized at that time  that the only hope was to 
get out. We weren't going to make it. Ther
e was no way you could survive. I don't think 
there was any doubt then in anybody's mi nd, ev
en the ones who had denied ma ny things 
before, didn't read the tea leaves very well, we
re sure that that was the time  that you had 
to get out. There was no other way. And so 
I reme mber having to go -- there were two 

ways you could get out, by quota 
or like my fa mi l y did, if you had a special visa because 
you had a special profession and had a job wa
iting for me . We had both. We had a quota 
which was comi ng up fairly soon and then we we
re able to get the other thing also, but 
the quota would have been earlier. I reme mber 
having to go to Studtgard to the American 
consult as a fa mily to see if the quota,
 the number would work. I remember the 
responsibility I felt of myself
 that some how I wa s supposed 
to behave, give the right 
answers, do the right thing and that was up to 
me to carry this thing off and I reme mb er 
when it didn't  work, the number didn't  wor
k. We  came the other way, that when the quota 
thing ended they said no this is not going 
to work, I thought that this personally was 

some how my fault, that i had probabl
y done some thing wrong. Not ma de a good 
impression or not smiled the right wa y or 
whatever it was that this didn't work. 
 So there was a -- I think everybody felt a great d
eal of responsibility for trying to get out 
and also we felt very much that we shoul
dn't bother our parents with anything, or any 
adult for that  matter because they were all --  fi rst of all they didn't have time for it, really 

they didn't at that point and they were so pr
eoccupied with just th
e ba sic necessities of 
making things go from day to day and tr
ying to ma ke plans for getting out. 
 

Q: You me ntioned that you would ha
ve lessons for several hours a day? 
 

A: In school, yes. 

 

Q: So you would actually go to school? 

 

A: Yes, we would go to school for a few 
hours a day, but it was very short, a very 
abbreviated day. 
 

Q: How would you get there? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0421  
20 
 
 
A: We walked. We always walked to school. Wa lking was the norm. 
 

Q: Did you feel was it scary to walk? 

 

A: Yes, well it was even more so -- of cour
se I wasn't  the only one. The sexton's children, 
the four of us, or the three of us rather, we
'd walk together. But walking was the way we 
always went to school, and it was on
ly a few hours a day at that point. 
 

Q: Were you ever threatened wh
ile walking during that period? 

 

A: I really must say I personally, fortunatel
y never wa s, no. I was one of the lucky ones. 
 

Q: During that time , did you begin to questi
on more your identity and whether you had any 
responsibility for what was happening on a gran
der scale or we re you able to say this is 
because these animals  have -- 
 

A: I think that was completely my attitude that
 these animals have -- no I never felt that the 
Jews had done some thing wrong because I knew that
 -- first of all I thought of my parents 
as being near perfect at that stage and 
I knew that they hadn't done anything wrong and 
looked what had happened to us. No, I didn't 
feel that the Jews  
had done anything wrong. 
No, I felt it was just part of a 
repetition of past history kind of thing. I didn't  feel that the 
Jews were at fault at all. 
 

Q: Did you believe that there was a place that
 you could go where Jews were not treated in 
that way? 
 
A: Well, I thought there would be a place in th
e world where the Jews could live and I knew 
they couldn't live in Germany. Now there mi ght 
be restrictions ther
e too and I sort of 
assume d at that point that all Jews lived undersome  restrictions but at
 least they lived and 
they weren't going to live in Germany 
and I think that wa
s pretty obvious. 
 
Q: How did you eventually find a way to emigrate? 

 

A: That's a long story. Actually everybody looked for relatives in other countries and 
some how there was an article about my father
 in a newspaper in New York and it so 
happened that we discovered a very rich a
unt on Park Avenue in New York and she wa s 
able to underwrite this special visa for prof
essionals if they had a job. The way she got 

my father a job is that she went to ra
bbi ___________ who was a rabbi in New York City 
and she said I will gi ve you a monthly payment of so much and you pay it to Rabbi Hahn 

and we'll call it a job for him. That 's how we 
were actually able to go this special visa 
who was for  professionals who had a job in an
other country. It was sheer luck and I think 
that's  one of the things that when I read a
bout the Holocaust and when I see pictures of 
the Holocaust it always comes to me  how eas
ily it could have been me . How easily, it's 
just sheer chance. It's just an amazing thing th
at that happened and as I say there's always 
a little bit of I can't  get over 
how lucky I am to be alive, b
ecause it's sheer chance that we 
happened to be able to get out.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0421

 The people from Esson that were killed 
is just tremendous. There were very few 
survivors, actually. 
 
Q: What was the date?   Do you reme mb er 
when you found out that you were going to be 
able to emigrate? 
 

A: We ca me  over in March of '39, so it was ma
ybe February, when it was finalized that they 
were going to accept this. There was also 
a quest ion whether they would accept this 

doctored up job. Once we found out that it woul
d be okay, it was just a few weeks before 

we left. 
 

Q: Do you remember the mood during that time ?  

 

A: Once we found of course well, when we
 found out that this was going to happen, we 
were of course very, very happy and of course, 
very, very scared. America is just such a -

- in a way you're happy because you're going to live. On the other hand you're afraid of 

what the new place will hold for you and compl e te
 readjustme nt and having to start from 
scratch in an unknown place, not knowing the language very well, although we had been 

studying English but it didn't amount  to much. 

 So, I mean we were very happy on the ot
her hand you feel terri
ble about the people 
you're leaving behind and you don't  know whether 
they will now get out or how they'll 
get out and one of the ones was my gra
ndmother who later died in ____________ and my 
aunt. They lived together. 

 Then the person who was very important in my
 life this head nurse who I was very, very 
close to and we were leaving her. Fortunately
 though I learned much, 
mu ch later that she 
did escape to Sweden after we left, so she was able to survive. 
 It was a big relief. I me a n there's no doubt th
at there was a big relief when we found out 
that we could leave the countr
y. The first feeling is one of 
being relieved and the second 
feeling is oh my but how is this really 
going to work out. How a m I going to ma ke a 
living. How are we going to survive under th
ese conditions. And then
 leaving a lot of 
friends, a lot of people we were very fond of
. My sister especially
 had a boyfriend she 
was very close to who she left behind. 
 
Q: Were there still ten people 
in the house at that point? 
 

A: There were still, yes, and 
the others then, the sexton and hi
s family later I guess were able 
to go to Columbia, South America, so they di
d escape also, but we left before they did. 
 

Q: So you left from this little home in Esson? 

 

A: We went by train to Hamberg and then t
ook a boat from Ha mberg and I reme mber on the 
train trip to Ha mberg of c
ourse everybody was in tears 
and Ireme mber my mother 
crying. My mother hadn't  cried very much 
during this whole time  and my mother was 
crying and I was very upset th
at my mother was crying and 
I asked my father what she 
was crying about and he said well, she's 
crying because she's worried about all the 
suitcases that we are taking. What's s he goi
ng to do with them in America because the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0421  
22 
 
 
apartments are very small. Then I came  fo
rth with oh well we can store them in the 
baseme nt or this or that and he said we ll I'
ll tell her and that will do it. I reme mber being 
terrible concerned about the 
suitcases and how we were 
going to store them properly 
once we got there. 
 Then we got to Hamberg and got on the 
boat and because we couldn't take any money 

out we went first class because we spent it 
all on that, and almost everybody was seasick 
the whole trip. Except one day there was big me
als and I think I was the only one in the 
family who was able to eat. I went  by myself
 into this place where they were serving tea 
and I had tea by myself because everybody else in the family was sick. 
 

Q: How long did the trip take? 

 

A: Close to a week. Maybe five or six days. 

 

Q: Did you meet people on th
e boat who were escaping? 
 

A: Similar -- no not really. They were mostly 
tourists actually.. I me
t some American boys 
who I thought were my age and I tried to st
udy what they were saying, trying to prepare 
for what was ahead. 
 

Q: Were you feeling hopeful? 

 

A: Yes, actually I was, but I didn't know all th
e change that was ahead. It was much more 
difficult for my parents obviously. 
When we landed here this rela
tive of ours, the one that 
rescued us actually, was there to meet us. 
My parents had actually been studying English 
for a year, year and a half, found out they re
ally couldn't understand a word. They didn't  
speak very much and this relative of our
s was a very well to do lady. She had a black 
ma id and wa s very fancy and she took us to her apartment and we had lunch there and it 

was really very uncomfortable I think fo
r everybody even though we were very, very 
grateful to her but the comm
unication and the lifestyle and I guess we didn't know what 
was expected, what was good ma nners, what wa
s the right thing to do and what was the 
wrong thing to do and all those things. 

 Then there was another very wealthy person 
who lived in Esson who had left before us 

and they had a big house in Scarsdale and they 
said that after we a
rrived we could stay 
with them for a while until we decided what
 we were going to do. So, we moved out to 
their house. These were people who lived in 
Esson. They had sort of a big, big villa, 
almost a palace and I was always in awe of th
em. The way my fa mily talked about them I 
always felt it was like the king 
or some thing like that, some  exalted person and we were 
going to live in their house. I was also c
oncerned was I doing the right thing, was I doing 
the wrong thing and so I had a meal ther
e and I reme mber them saying well, we 
suggested that we help with washing up and so
 my sister and I went into the kitchen and 
started to help wash up and I saw for the firs
t time they used soap to wash the dishes. I 
wasn't  used to that and so afterwards I sa
id you know what they do, they use soap on the 
dishes. We hadn't done that at home . I don't th
ink it was a very comf
ortable time  for my 
parents either even though it was a very ge
nerous thing and obvi
ously we needed it. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0421  
23 
 
 
 Then we stayed there for about three or four
 weeks and then my father decided what he 
was going to do was build up a German Jewish
 congregation in New York even though 
everybody had told him i t  had been attempted ma ny times and they have fa iled. But he 
was going to do it. Of course he had the s
ynagogue of this rabbi who he was supposedly 
working for and so he started building acongregation. Actually he was very, very 

successful. The congregation is 
in existence today and my brother-in-law was the second 
rabbi and they have an Ameri
can rabbi now. He did do well. 
 We  then moved to, first we moved to H
ugh Gardens into a little apartment and our 
furnishings and furniture hadn't come yet so we were borrowi ng things from people 

around and it was one bedroom. Now we had come
 from a -- well of course after crystal 
night we lived in very cramped quarters but 
before that we lived in a 14 room house and 
we were used to upscale living certainly w
ith people to help around the house, two or 
three of them anyway. So, we were in this li
ttle apartment with my parents sleeping in the 
living room on the studio couch which could be
 converted into a be
d and the other room 
and havingno money, and my mo
ther was not used to housework or anything. She had 
never done that in her life. That's what I wa
s saying before, the wonde
rful thing about my 
parents is they took thin
gs as they are. They never complained or they never said oh but 
in Germany I had it so differently and poor 
me , what I have to do now. They never ma de 
us feel that. They never ma de us feel deprived
 or  that this was a terr ible hardship and I 
really admi re them for that because it was su
ch a change, especially for my mother. She 
never complained about it though, just took 
it that that's  the way things are. 
 I reme mber there was no money. I reme mber 
that since they were borrowed things we 
were supposed to be very careful about them,but there was no desk either so I was doing 

-- we were in school by that time, and I wa
s doing home work and some how I was writing 
in ink and I put an ink spot 
on the cover of this down cover 
and we tried to get it out and 
we couldn't get it out. My mother was just be
side herself and I felt terrible and when our 
own stuff ca me  then we finally returned it 
and my mother apologi
zed and she could not 
get over how that could happen that there was th
is big spot on this blanket. Things were 
very hard financially. There was no money. 
I reme mber we never had icecream because 
that was too expensive. I reme mber going to 
school and they used to have cookies at 
recess a penny or so a piece. I was allowe
d to have that once every second week, 
something like that. We just lived
 -- we had the bare mi nimu m. 
 But as I say, the good thing was that my pare
nts really didn't complain about it and didn't 
say well in Germany we had 
this and this and this. 
 

Q: You me ntioned that you even grew closer as a family? 

 

A: Much closer, because there was nobody between us. My mot her took over motherly 
things that she hadn't done before because 
some how she grew up with the idea that she 
had to live a certain way and she accepted th
at and one of them was that you had other 
people take care of your children. I don't thi
nk she ever questioned it. She became a real 
mother, got very involved in our lives and 
we became a very close knit family. That was 
the very, ve ry positive part. And she enjoyed it
 and I think afterwards she realized how 
much she had mi ssed by not having it or doing 
it before. She took to it naturally and it 
was very mu ch a part of her. As a family we lived in this very, very tiny apartment 

together and so we became  much more involv
ed and I think we shar
ed a lot of things 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0421  
24 
 
 
whereas they didn't share that much with us in Ge rmany, partly because they didn't think 
it was proper and partly to prot
ect us, but here in America we
 were really involved in the 
ups and downs  of the congregation. This is 
where I get my ideas of congregational life 

because we were very involved in what ever
ybody said, what every me mber said or  any 
criticism that went on. 
 

Q: Were you going to a Jewi
sh school at this time ?  
 

A: Inthiscountry? 

 

Q: No, it was just a regular school
. At that time  their theory wa
s just plunk the kids into the 
classroom a nd eventually they'll catch on and I 
think actually that's  the best way to learn. 
It ma y be very, very hard but at least you do 
learn it and you learn it in
 a very short time. 
I think within three or  four weeks I was participating fi rst in math and then in the ot her 

things and there was only one other German Je
wish boy in my class. I think ma ybe even 
in the school, but anyway there was one in my class and he would refuse to speak 

German. He was an American by then and he re
fused to own up to the fa ct that he could 
speak German and understand German. So, I wasn't  able to communicate with him and 

he was no help to me  because he was an Am
erican by then and wouldn't have anything to 
do with refugees. 
 

Q: Did you reflect during that time  a lot upon your
 life in Germa ny and the events that had 
led up to your leaving? 
 

A: Yes, very very much and especially as we 
heard -- well we were very worried about what 
was happening to the people we had left behind 
and reflected it on very, very much of my 
life and always because I reflec
ted on it really felt sepa rate from the other kids for a long 
long time. I reme mber still when I was in colla
ge I'd think to myself when I'm going to 
ma rry it's only going to be to some body who has had the same  experience I have. I don't 

think anybody could understand me  who hasn't  
gone through that. Actually, that's what I 
did. It was a very strong feeling 
of feeling very separate from
 people. I felt that I'd seen 
much more, knew much more. I 
was different. I was apart. 
 

Q: Did people ask you where you came from?  

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: What did you tell them? 

 

A: I said Germany. We ll, they knew it by 
my accent and everything else and actually 
German refugees was very common a t  that time. 
 

Q: Did they know you were Jewish? 

 

A: Oh yes, in New York City that was fine. That never posed a problem all the time I was in 
school in New York.

Q: They weren't curious atall about your background? 

 

A: No, they didn't  ask much and I must say 
I didn't volunteer mu ch and I was sort of also 
trying to get accepted as being one of them. S
o, di fferences that I had I wasn't  willing to 
accentuate at that point. I was sort of on th
e same  wave length as this ot her boy. I was 
trying to become Americanized to be accepte
d to be part of the group, rather than 
pointing up differences of what I had known, 
what I had seen, what I had gone through. 
 

Q: How did those early years in Germany infl
uence you in the few years that were following 
as you were a teenager and grow
ing up and being an American? 
 

A: Well, I think that it made me realize --  it 
ma de me  more pessimi stic of human nature of 
people and of what can happen in the world and 
I think also I realized
 how important it is 
to stand up for what you think and what you belie
ve and I think the fe
eling to do the right 
thing, social justice and so forth became  very
 i mportant in my life. It has been very 
important in my life, along with the feeli
ng that anything can happe
n anywhere, any time . 
It can happen here. I think it's with you, not c
onsciously, but I think 
it's with you all your 
life that you just have this certain knowledge 
of things that other people don't have. You 
don't even think they can understand. 

 In my case I didn't really want to bring it up 
too much. It's  mine, it
's part of me . I know 
it's there and because I felt that others mi ght not
 understand or reject I sort of kept it to 
myself rather  than shar e it. 
 

Q: Do you believe that people here were different? 

 
A: No, because the people I had known before
 were very nice. Some  of the m like 
__________. I didn't feel they were different. I felt
 they were very kind but I didn't feel 
that you couldn't change. I guess that's what 
I mean by my basic feeling of pessimi sm 
because I didn't think that could ever happen. 
My father was one of the most respected 
people in Esson, very well known, at one point 
had a lot of non-Jewish friends and so 
forth, and it happened to him so I guess I sort 
of had the feeling that anything is possible 
given certain circumstances. 
 

Q: Has your father rema ined in New York? 

 

A: Yes, he was a rabbi in New York, well he re
tired and then he died 
a little later and my 
brother-in-law took over the congr
egation before my father re
tired and my  brother-in-law 
has now passed away too and so has my sister
. But it's a thriving congregation still. When 
I go back there some  of the people, people 
who knew me  from the time I was ten years 
old, they'r e now in their 
eighties, high eighties. 
 

Q: Could you just tell me  a little bit when you were in New York for how long before you 
me t your husband?

A: I came over when I was ten and I me t Ernie wh
en I was 17, so seven years. He was in the 
army and actually it's one of those things th
at he was on furlough a
nd his parents invited 
my fa mily and children to come  over. Actua
lly, the way it worked is they invited my  
sister who is two and a half years older, but
 they felt that I was too young. So, I didn't go. 
I wasn't  invited, I wasn't  included in the invi
tation. Then my parents invited his parents 
back and that's when we met for the first 
time and the thing with my sister and Ernie 
didn't work out but he decided that he was inte
rested in me  but my sister who was a very 
domi neering kind of person didn't 
take kindly to that so he di
dn't  know how to get out of 
it so what he did is arrange for a double da
te and asked us and 
I thought it was fine. I 
thought I was going to go with a friend and Er
nie was going to go with my sister because 
that's how it had been. I thought they liked e
achother and that's  how 
it had been arranged 
originally and we were going 
to a concert in Lewis Stadium and we were going to go on 
the bus and as we were board
ing the bus I was going with 
this other guy and he said no, 
no, you go with me  and they go together. So, then
 we got to the concert and my sister was 
just furious. She wouldn't talk to him. This
 poor guy who happened to be a very nice guy 
just wouldn't talk to him the whole time and th
en we got back and then we started dating. 
 

Q: When did you ma rry? 

 

A: I was twenty. I got ma rried, I finished college
 in three years and duri
ng that time  first he 
was at Columbia and then he was up at Co
rnell and he came home  and would come  and 
visit, take the bus down actually which was 
quite a trip. There was a certain amount of 
friction, we had German fa milies that we ha
d dealings with and his family was much 

more old fashioned than my fa mily. They ha
d the idea that when he came home -- they 
lived in Brooklyn, that he should first come  
to see them and he shouldn't see me and our 
idea was that we should meet first in the ci
ty and then he could go home . There were 
arguments all the time about his role toward
s his parents and towards me . Eventually, 
after we got ma rried we spent a summe r in Ne
w York and then we moved to Cornell and 

that solved all problems fo
r everybody. When we came we just shuffled back and forth 
between the fa milies. 
 

Q: How long were you in Cornell? 

 

A: Well we were fi rst in Cornell for three year
s and then Ernie graduated and was in practice 
for a year. Then he came back and he got hi
s Phd which was another three years and two 

of our children were born during that time in Co
rnell. Then after that we came out here 
and the other two were born out here. Actua
lly the life at Cornell was one of the best 

parts we both think of our lives. We  were gra
duate students and we 
lived in this housing 
project and everybody there had no fa mily but lo
ts of them had little kids and it was a 
nice community. We  helped each othe r out. There was always some body there for you. It 

was very congenial living ev
en though you had no money but 
it wasn't  hopeless because 
everybody knew eventually once they finished 
their studies they'd be okay. So, that was 
one of the nice parts actu
ally looking back on that. 
 

Q: What were you studying?

A: I wasn't . He was studying ve
terinarian medicine. Cornell is
 a me d school and I had a job 
for a while in a flower store, not much of a job and then we were in practice. When he  
was in practice I had another 
secretarial job. Then when we came back I was pregnant 
and had children at that ti
me . You were home with kids
, there was no child care or 
anything. 
 

Q: And you've lived in Davis for 40 years? 

 

A: Right. It's been a good place, a good place toraise children. A bad pl
ace for teenagers. I 
think they get sort  of bored with it. 
 

Q: Now that you've had the span of our lifetim
e and you've had years to reflect on your early 
childhood and you me ntioned your feeling of 
pessimis m after you arrived, has that 

remained? 
 

A: Yes, it has, it really has. I don't see how 
it could ever leave you 
after you've seen first 
hand what you have seen. You can't  erase that
. It was so ma ny people I reme mber when 
the synagogue was burning when we were 
comi ng out, there was a whole crowd there 
standing there and cheering and they were 
throwing things. It wasn't  one or two 

individuals doing this. It was a whole bi
g population. So, yes, I don't see how you can 
wash that away or come to any ot
her conclusion that it's possible. 
 

Q: What's  given you hope and kept you going all these years? 

 

A: Well I think the hope is that you have to s
how people and alert peopl
e to the dangers and 
ma ke the m a ware that when they see an inju
stice you have to stand up right away because 
if you don't do it right away, later on you can't
. That was certainly with the Germans. 
When some of them finally 
realized, it was too late for them to even do something 
without endangering themselves.
