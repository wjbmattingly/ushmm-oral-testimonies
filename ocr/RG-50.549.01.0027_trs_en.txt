 [Date not Labeled on audio tape]
 
 
 
Ans w er:  M y nam e is Maddie( ph)  Deuts c h, I 
was born on April 29
th, 1930, in a city 
called Bett er hov o(ph),  in, in a Cz ec
h name.  The Hung
arian name was 
Bettexas(ph) and presently 
it's occupied by the Uk ra
ine and so now it  is  
Beregoval( ph).  This city 
belonged, prior to Wo
rld War 1, to the 
Austrio-Hungarian 
empire and it  was a time 
when the Jews ____________ a beau
tiful life.  Then after 
World War 1,  when th
ey cut up Europe, th
is  part  of  the c o
untr y was given t o  
Cz echoslo vakia and in
 1938 back to Hungar
y.   In 1945, after World War 2,  it 
bec am e part of  t h e Soviet  
Un ion and as we know, 1991, 
the Sov iet  Union br ok e u p  
and now it  is  part of the 
Ukr a ine.  So, in one litt le
 city, one live
d many, many 
different, many cultur
es and many diff
erent  lifest y les.   I  went
 t o Hungar ian sc hools  
bec aus e m y par e nts prim ar ily  wer e educat
ed in the Hungarian language, so were 
their par e nt s, who als o  were 
bor n in t hat s ame
 general area.  194
4, March t h e 19th, 
Hitler invaded Hungary and within days we
 were ordered 
to we ar a yellow star on 
our out er garment s s o t hat 
when we we re on 
the streets, we were recognized 
imm ediat ely as J e ws and t h er
ef ore s ec ondary c it iz e ns.  They also or der ed v ar i ou s  
degr ees t h at J e ws were allowe
d or not allowed to do.  And 
within weeks, 
within just 
a matter of couple of weeks,
 we landed in t
he ghetto in our home
town and we did 
not st ay t h er e v ery long bec a us e by this
 time the G er m ans, t he Hungar i ans  were 
really, the Hungarian Jews were the last 
ones to be taken away
 and alt h ough we 
didn't know anything about 
what was happening anywhere 
in the easter
n European 
countr ies, we wer e pack ed up in a m att er 
of a f e w day s and,  int o t h e ghett o and w e  
stay ed t h er e just m ay be t w o weeks and fr om
 there unt o the bo
xc ars and t a k en t o  
A us ch w it z.  De scr ib ing  this tr ip t o A us ch w it z 
is one of the most di
fficult things that I 
will ever do.  There were 
80 to 100 people packed in
to these boxcars that had 
nothing but a couple of little
 windows for air and when 
we got onto the train we 
were giv en a buc k et of wat er f or dr in
king and an empty buc
ket f or persona l  
elim in ation whic h neither one of them last
ed even a half  a da
y.  Old people, young 
people, babies, men, women together and 
the trip lasted about three days and 
three nights.  During
 the day it  was hot and becaus
e t he air that we receiv e wa s  
only through these couple of 
little windows.  At nighttime
 we were tr
aveling through 
the Alp mountains and it  was quit e, quite cold
.  We had no blanke
ts or pillows, food, 
no water and so it  was just a,
 one of the most ho
rr ible tr ips that one could ev er t ak e.   
And so aft er we hav e  arr iv e d in the dest
ination, whic h we had
 of course no idea 
wher e it was, was nightt im e and we s a w 
in
 the distance flames and some noises 
and dogs barking and 
we had to wait unti
l daylight when they
 opened up the doors 

to the, the boxc ar s and we wer e separ a
ted immediat ely ,  men fr om the wom en and 
we wer e being m arc hed t o one, men one 
dir ect ion, the wom e n t he ot her and i n  
each area they had the young
 c h ildren and older people still
 int o anot her dir ect ion .  
And of c ourse we found out 
later that they were taken 
straight t o the cremat or ium  
where they were burned
.  Those of us that
 looked younger
 and stronger were take n 
in the dir e ction of t h e barr ac ks  wher e, 
this was in Birkenau,
 Auschwit z and we 
stay ed t her e f or  appr o ximat e ly  one week,  
we were lucky that 
we only stayed for 
one week and we had t o be
 lined up ever y mor n ing and ev ery ev ening, any w her e 
from three to five hours w
here they were counting us to
 make sure th
at nobody ran 
away.  But the ir ony is that how could pe
ople run away when t h ere were t h es e wir e  
fences that were about
 10, 12 feet tall, wi
th electricity running 
through them
 so that 
any body touc hed it, t h ey wer e
 dead.  But nevertheless, th
is was their polic y.  As I 
said, after about a week or
 two we were lined up agai
n and loaded onto trucks with 
canvas cover and we 
were, didn't know again wher
e we were going.  Dr iv en at 
night and so that we woul
dn't see wh ere we were being
 t a ken.   And we hav e  
arr iv e d a, at a sm all plac e 
where there were only about 
500 other inma
tes.  They 
were from, originally 
fr om Poland and t hey
 had been dis p lac e 
already, close to a 
year.  And they were wo rk
ing in an amm unit ion m anuf act ur ing plant and were  
about 500 of us that 
were taken in this tr
ansport, from Auschwitz to this small camp, 
joined t h es e ot her women and 
where we  worked in the fact
ory also, almost a year. 
The situat ion t h er e was bas i ca
lly the s am e , we had t o  stand in line f r om t hr ee t o  
five hours each morning an
d evening to be counted that 
we were not 
going to run 
away.  We worked 12 hours in
 t h is am munit i on fact ory,  
walk ing to and f r om  for an 
hour.  The food we re
ceived was very, very
 minimal.  Many p
eople died.  And of 
course we never knew
 when anybody was goi
ng to be killed fo
r any reason or no 
reason at all.   And we tried our best to do 
the work or at least do
 as much of it as 
we were able to, to 
try to somehow hope that we will 
survive if  we 
do the work. 
Basically, if I go back
 to t he day s  of when we wer e 
liberat ed, whic h is r eally May 
8t h, 1945, while we 
were working in this camp, as 
I mentioned, there was a la dy  
who was in c har ge, s h e was  a c a ppo( ph), 
she was a Jewish lady
 who was selected 
by the German SS and her jo
b was t o m ake sur e t h at we
 line up for t hes e, what  
they call ____________, wh ere 
we were being 
counted and then
 after she has 
counted us and found everybod
y there, then she would ca
ll t
h e SS and they  would 
recount us to make su
re that in fact n
obody ran away.  
The days were
 very long, 
very, in the winter very
 cold and s u mmert im e t err ibly hot
, we had no pr oper clot h in g  
and t he, t h e y ear seemed like f or ev er that we
 were in this camp.  My luck was that 
my m other pr otect ed me in what ev er wa
y she could and the wa
y s he c ould pr ot ec t  
me was trying to talk 
t o  me ever y s i ngle day bec a us e I wa
s a very slim li
ttle girl, just 
turned 14 and I found
 the work very, very
 hard and also ever
ything scared me 
because I was just a child 
and I came from a very we
ll pr otect ed,  warm hom e and 
when I was in this camp 
ther e was no protect i on from
 anything.  An d so I wa s 

alwa ys scared and jumpy and fearful.  If 
I saw the SS, I was 
tr em bling, s o m y  
mot her used t o talk t o me and 
try to say to try to 
hold off and tr y t o 
pret end, ev en if I  
couldn't do the act ual work, 
but that I'm trying to do it 
and j ust s o  that she woul d 
pr otect m e from t he SS.  Th
e ot her way s h e helped me wa
s, whic h I did not find out 
until after the war was over
.  We were give
n some warm, luke
warm water,  they 
called it c of f ee, in t h e mor n ing wit h a pi
ec e of br ead and in 
the evening after we 
came back from work, we 
would get some warm s
oup, which was nothing but 
gr een leav es f l oat ing in s om e
 warm wat er.  But 
t his piece of br e
ad was really what  
had to la st for the day 
to help us surviv
e, s o  what  my  m ot her  di
d,  in or der t o pr ot ect  
that br ead that no one would dare to t ak e
 it away from a 14 y e ar old c h ild, she 
would hold it c l os e t o her bos om t he whol
e day and ev er y so of
t en s he would br eak 
off a piece of bread and she w
ould give it to me to sort 
of t i e me over  and s h e did 
the same for herself, she woul
d take a piece of 
bread during the day.
  But I did not 
find out unt il t he war was ov er
 t hat when she br ok e of f a 
piec e of br ead and ga ve it  
to me, that she not only gav e 
m e my port ion of the br ead, but s h e gav e m e s o me of  
hers, t o help me s ur v iv e.  And t h is  too, he
lp ed  an a wf u l lo t in m y s urv iv a l.  We wer e  
here approximately, doing pr
etty much the same kind of 
work in the factory, and  
marching to and from and th
en one day in the spr i ng,  of
 course we didn't know 
what  day it  was  bec a us e we had no c a l
endar or radio or an
ything, one mornin g 
when this lady, the cappo(ph
) woke us up and lined us 
up and count ed u s an d s h e 
went t o report to t he SS, s h e went to 
the barr ac ks, bec a us e s h e was allo wed to go 
there, she was the only one 
that was allo wed to go th
er e and s h e was  going t o  
report  that  we are all t here 
and she couldn't find a single 
SS in t h e barrack s.   So 
she went f r om one t o
 the next, ther e wer e s ev er a l of
 them wher e t he ,  all t h e SS 
were.  And she f ound no one.
  So she assumed 
that the war was ov
er and that the 
SS ran away.  An d in fact 
she must have gone to the radi
o wh ere the SS kept their  
radios and she must have li
stened and she came out sayi
ng, "Yes, we are free, the 
war is ov er and we are free 
to go any w her e t hat we want 
to."  And that point, all of 
us wer e cr ying and laughi
ng and hugging
 and k i ss ing and ever y em ot ion t h at we 
can go through because we we
re free and we somehow ma
de it before
 they had a 
chance to kill us
.  And we were liberat
ed by the Russian sold
iers and when they 
found all of us being 
s o  sick and weak and emac iat e d, 
they took the very, very sick 
ones int o the local hos p ital 
and t o ok t he ot her ones that
 were not quite
 as sick and 
placed them into 
hom e
s  wher e t he G erm an Nazis 
ran away from when they saw 
that the war was ov er and 
they were afraid that th
ey going to be caught an d 
punished.  So so
me of the people were 
placed in ther
e and the sold iers brought in 
doctors and medicine and tri
ed t o help us and m y m ot h
er and I was among those 
that was placed in one of t
hese homes.  And we st ay ed t h
ere f or about thr e e or  fou r  
weeks trying to gain our st
r e ngt h back bec ause t her e was 
only one thought in the 
minds of all of us and that
 was to try to get home 
and search for our families 

because we didn't know what
 happened to anyone and so
 we were hoping that 
when we go home, we
'll find each other
 and start a new family, a family  again.
 
Q: I want to ask about the fa
mily  that you stayed wi
th, what, what
 was their 
nationality and do you reme
mber anything about them and your attitude towar d  
them.
 
A: I did not stay with
 families, these are the people t
hat ran away.  These were th e 
Nazi homes.
 
Q: You wer e in a v ac a nt hom e?
 
A: Mm-hm.
 
Q: And who, was t h er e food?
 
A: As I said, the Russian so
ldier s,  the oc cupiers  br ought  
us food and medicine and 
that' s how we wer e being helped t o
, y o u k now, t o get
 stronger again.
 
Q: I'm trying to get 
a pict ur e when you s ay we, was  
ther e a group of peop le wh o 
you wer e c l os e, c loser to t han t h e ot her s ?
 
A: No, not basically, just 
people who survived and if  
had t w o sist ers s ur viv e ,  
natur a lly they would st ay t
ogether  or lik e m y  mot her  
and I surviv ed 
so we stayed 
together and we  were 
just  trying to get some food and medicine to try to ge t 
stronger so that somehow we
 could get, head ba
ck home to look for our families.
 
Q: But y o u and your m ot her wer e in t h
is place with lo ts of other people?
 
A: Mm-hm, there we re, as 
I mentioned originally , t
here were about 500 women 
there from the Poland and t
hen the next 500 were us, who were taken later, from 
A us ch w it z to t h is c a mp.  
I might j ust see wh
at I'm touching 
and what I'm not 
touc hing ther e.  And t h is  is  t h
e part that's very im portant, 
there.  As I mentioned, the 
Russian soldiers 
were helping us with bringing 
food and medicine to this homes, 
wher e the em pty hom es that 
we, they have places us 
after the Germ an SS ran 
away.  And took us several 
weeks, I'd say about three,
 four week s unt i l we had 
enough ener gy t o s ort  of walk ar ound and 
just even think abou
t going home.  An d 
that we did because the 
only thought that we had in
 mind was to
 get home, 
bec aus e we wer e hoping that  if any  of  
members of our family
, would do the same 
and that we would m eet t her e and be a fa
mily  again.  When
 my mother  and I 
arr iv e d, we went str a ight to our home 
and when we appr oac hed it t here were 
people livin g in there and they
 were looking out the wi nd
ow whic h faced the street 
and of course when th
ey recognized us, they got scar
ed.  They said, "What?  You 
return, you surviv ed? 
 We were told  that you we
re all killed and now that you 
survived and now y
ou are back home, you 
will want your home
 back and you will 

want your businesses 
back.  This is  terrib le, we t
hought that you were
 all killed." 
My mot h er and I looked at 
one anot her and my 
mot h er said, " N o, 
we don't want our 
home back, we do not want our business
 back and we don'
t want to live among 
you.  Any o ne who was our nei
ghbor and business partne
rs or business associat e 
and this is the kind of gree
tings that we get wh en you 
see that we  had surviv ed, we 
don't want to or we are 
unable to live among you again.
"  And my mother and I 
turned on our h
eels and wa lked away.  We walk ed to
 t he c ent er of the c it y, wher e 
there were alr e ady  s om e of the s urv ivor
s  who also went  hom e, t ry i ng t o  f in d  
families and I don'
t remember now whether we 
were put into a big home, 
somebody's home or rather
 a s m a l l h ot e l, bu t we we
r e placed s om ewher e ag ain 
while we were waitin
g to see if my father or my 
brother will come
 home. Becaus e 
most of our  fam ilies, y ou k
now, lik e mot h er 's parent s and
 sisters and brothers, live d 
in different cities.  So basi
c a lly  h er e we wer e wa it in g f o
r my f ather and m y brother ,  
hopef u lly  that t h ey  would co
me back.  And so, several 
weeks passed by and ever y 
day a train arr iv e d and we we
nt to the tr ain stat ion to 
see if by some miracle my 
fat her  or m y br other  would 
be on it.  And t h en week s went
 by and they
 were not on 
there and s o one of t h e men,
 who was a for m er 
c it i zen of our t own, he appar e nt ly  
had pity  on us, bec a us e we 
been doing this now for weeks 
aft er week s, going t o t he 
railr oad st at ion ever y day and m y f at her 
and my brother didn't 
show up so he called 
my mother on the side and m
yself  and he said that we 
should not wait, we should 
get away from here 
as far as we can, 
exc us e me.   Bec a us e m y f at her  and m y  
brother are not coming
 back.  So my mother aske
d how does he know?  And he 
said that he was in the sa
m e camp wit h t h em and he sa
w them die, so he knows 
that t hey ar e not c om i
ng back.  So wi
th that, my mother  turned to me and she said, 
"You know, we fought all this
 time so that we
 have our family ho
pefully together 
again and we suffered all of 
this and then, now that t
he war is over
, we found out 
there was no reason to fight 
and to suffer, because ther
e is no family left.  We 
should take our lives now, because it's worthl
ess, it's useless." 
 And I said to her 
that I had j ust t ur n ed 15, ni
ne days bef or e t he war was  ov er
 and I said all I k new in 
my whole young lif e is suf f er ing.   I woul
d like t o go on liv ing t o see if ther e is  
anything better in this worl
d, if there are better peopl
e, if there are kinder people 
and if ther e is a bett er lif e. 
 So s h e s a id t h at if that ' s 
what I want, t h en her job as a 
mot her  was  to go on with m e
, to help me surviv
e and go on and tr
y to make a new 
life for myself.  So at this point we pack ed
 up the couple of th
ings that w
e  had an d 
we were leaving our 
hom etown and went ov er t o Rom
ania but at this point it was 
hard t o get  ov er t h ere alr
eady because the Soviet Union 
occupied this area.  The 
one t h ing I for got  to m entio
n t h at my f ather had hidden 
some dollar b
ills and som e  
je we lr y b ef or e we wer e ta ke
n away and he showed it t o al
l t hree of us 
th at if  we  
didn't know what was to happen
 to us, that is anybody ca
me back, to see wh ere it 
was so maybe it will help us go
 on when
 the war is over.
 

Q: Could you describe, did yo
u have to sneak in to the yard to find that money?
 
A: Yes, what happened was, 
the money and the jewe lr y, 
my father hi
d in one of 
thes e sm all mas o n jar s, s ealed
 and he buried it in one 
of our wareh
ouses in the 
ground.  And because 
we knew that we ha
ve these neighbors th
at used to be our 
good neighbors and friends a
nd t h ey greet e d us in the ma
nner that I just described, 
we certainly didn't want to dig for it 
during the day where 
they would see us and 
poss ibly hurt us.  So at 
night  we took  s om e  s hov els 
and the two of 
us and went  
there and we dug up the mone
y  in t he one j ar and t h e j e
welr y in t h e other j ar and 
we took that money and so
me of it  we paid border 
guards between Hungary and 
Romania s o that we c ould ge
t out already and the Ru ssian 
s o ldier s wer e t her e, s o  
in order to be able t o get ou
t of t h er e and go ov er t o 
Romania wher e m y m other's,  a 
lot of my mother 's family lives.   And so 
we gave them quite a 
bit of this money so 
that they would get us out of
 t h ere and t h at' s how we we
re able to get away already 
at t hat  point .  And then we 
live in, in Romania, this is
 again Transylvania, Romania, 
Hungary, where they 
changed again in 1940,
 it became Hungar
y again and then 
after the World War 2, 1945,
 it  became part
 of Romania.  
And my mother had 
sist ers t h er e and other  fam i ly
 and so we th
ought we'll s t ay t h er e and s ee if any o f  
thos e m em bers of t h e fam ilies m i
ght have s u rv iv ed 
and come back.
 
Q: Wher e were y o u at  this point?
 
A: This was, it wa s ca
lled Transylvania, 
Romania, Hungary, wh ich is the 
sout heaster n part of Hungar y.
 
Q: What was the r o of over y our  head?
 
A: At that  point, we had a s m all ap
art m ent, a one bedr oom apartm ent that  
som ehow, my mot h er ' s br ot
her lived there prio
r t o the war and 
so somehow they 
kept that apartment for him 
so when we  came ba
ck and my uncle 
surviv ed and h e  
came back, we 
moved in together and 
we lived there 
and we stayed there for close 
to a year, again, wait ing for 
hopefully family, to trickle back.
 
Q: In a little 
town called?
 
A: It's not a little to
wn, it wa s a f a ir ly  de ce
nt  s i zed t o wn, it 's  c a
lled Satoumary(ph) in 
Romanian and the Hungar ian 
name was  Satmar namat y(ph)  
and so we stayed here 
close to a year again, hopi
ng for somebody from the 
family to come back and 
actually one more sister 
came back, out of eight.
 
Q: Your mother's sister?
 
A: Yes.  Mm-hm.  And then.. .
 
Q: Could y ou des cr i be that?  
Do you remember her  return?
 

A: I don't quite reme
mber, well I remember
 the ret ur n bec aus e we were all jus t  
hugging and kissing and you know, we somehow
 were all lived in
 this one bedroom 
apartm ent  bec aus e it  was  v er y difficult  t o
 get anything else.  
And it  was j ust ,  you 
know, hope and despai
r because despair was that, yo
u know, my mother had eight 
siblings and only two of them came back. 
 Her parents were k
illed.  All the nephews 
and nieces and cousins,
 all of them were 
dead, all of them we
re killed, there was 
just this few of us, handful 
of us that surviv ed.  And agai
n, we didn't 
want to stay 
there either, because there ar
e a lot of the peopl
e were anti-Semitic
 aga i n t h er e as 
well.  And so we didn'
t want to st ay t h er e, we were
 hoping that we could possibly  
em igrat e.  And t h e r e as on we wanted t o 
c o me t o t he United St at es, bec a us e m y  
mot her ' s only  s i ster, who got  away just, 
c ouple of m o nths bef or e t h e war br ok e ou t  
in 1939, t h at s he had left and s o we wr ot e,
 well, her, fortunat
ely I remembered her 
addr ess in United St at es,  I was all of, 
what, 13 and I wr ote 
to them, you know, 
there' s a c ouple of us  surv ived
 and we  would like to come
 t o t h e United St at es s o  
that we can be together.  
And so one day she 
found out about this
, you know, then 
of course they arranged fo
r all the necessary
 papers, which wa
s quite difficult 
bec aus e at  that t im e t he Un
it ed St ates did not 
want to le t in much, many people of 
the eastern Euro
pean cont inent.  
 
Q: Could I as k y ou s o met h ing?  Do y ou, did 
she s av e that lett er that y ou wr ot e t o  
her, y o ur aunt?
 
A: I don't think so.
 
Q: No?
 
A: I don't think so.
 
Q: So y o u don't hav e an
y lett ers like t h at ?
 
A: No, that one I don't hav
e,  what  I do hav e letter s
 fr om m y  fat h er and m y 
gr andf at her  and from my unc l
e, who wr ot e to their s i ster
 here or their daughter, yo u 
know.
 
Q: T h is same woman we'r e t a lk ing about?
 
A: Ye s.  That basically, I ha
ve ot her lett er s that my f at h
er wr ote m y gr andf at her , the 
fat her of t h e girl that was he
re and her br ot hers and s i ster
s, wr it in g t o th em, t h is is  
going back to 1937, '38 and 
even the very beginning of
 '39, begging them to do 
what ever arrangem ent s they c a n for us to
 come to the St ates
, you know, because 
the, it looked like the war 
was im minent and if  they cannot
 help all of us, at least 
they should try to get my
 brother out, who 
wa s a teenager and 
my father, my 
parents were afraid that th
ey will take him in
to the army and G
od knows where he 
will wind up, if he'll wind up aliv
e at all.  So thes
e are letters 
that I have 
here, in the 

original handwriting of my 
father and my grand
father and uncles 
and aunts, who are 
begging them to try to do
 somethin g, but it  was 
too late at that point.
 
Q: Wer e you able t o r e ceive a r eply fr
om her or did y ou 
just never hear?
 
A:  No I, we did not.  The only 
t h ing t hat I  do hav e a c opy 
of is, where this daughter, 
this  s i ster who liv e d her e, wr ot e t o  the Am
er ic an Red Cr oss,  look ing for her par e nts  
and this wa s already the begi
nning, of 1944, in Apr i l ' 4 4,
 may b e a week or t w o aft er  
we wer e t a ken away.  And s o 
she did not get a reply, but 
she does hav e a c o py that 
the American Re d Cr oss did rece
ive this inquiry.  So I have
 a copy of that, my aunt 
has t h e or iginal.   So this  
is something that, you know
, is very, very precious 
bec aus e, y ou know, s he was l
ooking for t hem and we were
 already in 
Auschwitz, or 
when day, you know, days after 
they were kill
ed in Auschwitz.
 
Q: You mentioned, we're back
 now in Transylvania in a 
small apartment with your 
surviving family members,  you mentioned 
anti-Semitism.  What
 was it about the 
environment that, that 
happened that ma
de you know or feel or?
 
A: Well basically you know, we had this  pr
act i ce alr e ady, we had pr actic e f or m a ny ,  
many y ear s, y o u know, what it was lik e an
d with ant i-Semitism.  First very subtle 
and then if,  aft er a while it was n 't subt le
 any mor e, t h ey would j us t  say what ev er  
they felt  or if people came
 back and they o
pened up their own busi
nesses that they 
had before, they were, you k
now, really angry at
 them and they le
t the people know 
that y o u don't belong here 
any m or e and y o u s h ouldn' t 
have the businesses here, 
nor should you live here.  So
 when we  saw all of this
, this  was when we decided 
that it was time to move 
on fr om here, t o o, bec a us e th
is is not a home for us any 
mor e eit h er .  Nobody want s 
t h e Jews.  And so t h is is 
when we decid
ed to try to 
come to the United St
ates, you know, differen
t people were trying 
to go to different 
places.  So me to Israel, so
m e to Canada, s om e wher ev
er t h ey would ac cept us  
because you've probably re
ad about it, that most c
ountries did not want us,  
inc l uding the Unit ed St at es.  You know if 
you hear d about the s h
ip, the Saint Louis, 
where 1000 people were
 turned away, first from Cu
ba and then from
 the Unite d  
St ates and no ot her country want ed t h em
 so m ost of them wound up in a 
conc entr at ion c amp and k illed
.  So no country really w
ant ed t he Jews whet her it  
was during the war or
 even after the war.
 
Q: So when you went from
 Transy l vania, y o u were ther e for how long?
 
A: As I said, a litt
le less  than a year.
 
Q: And aft e r that?
 
A: That's when we we nt ba
c k t o Germ any bec a us e t hey
, you know you could not 
em igrat e  fr om Rom ania or f r om  t hes e coun
tries.   Only from Germ any or  Austria 

and t h os e ar e the places 
wher e the displaced, wher
e the concentratio n camps 
were.  So there were, you know, thou
sands and thousands 
and thousands of 
people who surviv ed the conc
entratio n camps bu
t they had nowhere to go, so they 
were all just hanging
 around in some of
 t h es e cam p s.  Now s om e of t h es e c a mps  
were actually concentra
t ion camps, pr ior.  And then 
of course, the SS we nt away, 
ran away.  Some of t h em wer e, t hes e wer e
 most ly ar m y barr ac ks and s o when we 
were in, in the camp, 
this  particular camp 
was near Munich.  It's
 called Poking(ph) 
and it was  a r ather lar ge c am p
.  A nd s o we wa ite d h ere .
 
Q: When you say we, 
who do you mean?
 
A: M y m other and m ys e lf.
 
Q: So you said good- bye to your relatives?
 
A: Yes,  st ay, one of t h em stay t h er e, s h
e got marr ied and st ay ed t here,  her s i ster  
and t h e br other st ayed ther e f o
r awhile but then he also 
cam e t o t h e United St at es,  
also about 1949.
 
Q: And the distance from wh
er e you wer e  to wher e yo
u went, to the camp in 
Germ any, how did you get?
 
A: Again, you know by this  
time they had some railroad, 
you know, trains travelin g. 
Not t he boxcar s, but m or e or 
less regular railroads
 s o we would hitc h r i des on t hem  
or we would hitch rides with
 farmers and pay them some
thing, you know.  Because 
there was no ot her tr ans portat i on and we 
want ed to go bac k to Germany wher e ,  
that was the only place we 
could emigrate to, 
either United States or anywhere 
else.  Q: This is the 
end of Tape 1, Side A.
 
A: Okay, so in or der to seriously thin
k i ng about m o ve,  you k
now, coming to the 
United St at es  wher e my m ot her ' s only sur v
iving sister came, we
 had to go back t o  
Germ any and st ay in one of
 these displa ced person's 
camps, where most of the 
sur v iv or s of  Wor l d War  2 and pr im ar ily of 
c o ur se t h e Holocaus t s urv ivor s, s i nc e we 
had no other home, t h at we
 made this, these camps our 
homes and trying to mak e  
what ever arrangem ent s hav e 
t o  be in or der  to be able
 to emigrate, whatever we 
could.  T h e r eas on we want ed to c om e 
t o t he Unit ed St at es was bec ause m y  
mot her ' s sister  was here and s h e' s t he only
 one that was able to
 get away before, 
just before the wa r broke ou
t.  And so I  remembered he
r address and wrote to her 
that a f e w of us sur v iv ed and
 that  we would lik e t o c o
m e t o the Unit ed St at es an d 
could they mak e t he arrangem
ent s?   And so we got a le
tter back, oh by all means, 
you know and they would have 
to do, they would do whatev
er they have to do.  In 
other wo rds they had to guar
antee that we
 would not be a burden on the United 
St ates government, that we would have a jo
b wait ing f o r us and a home waiting f or 
us and that we will no
t be any kind of bu
rden of the governmen
t or of the United 

St ates c it iz en, that we would not tak e aw
ay their jobs, their ho
mes, et cetera.  So 
they filled out all these fo
rms and whatev
er else they needed, but being that we 
were born in Czechoslovakia
 and that quota syst
em is very, very small,  you see. 
Ev en the United St ates allowed only a 
very small number of
 people annually  to 
enter the United States
 and there were cert
ain countr ies  that ha
d even less, I mean 
a minute amount of peopl
e that they would let in
 annually.  And we were 
unfort unately am ong t h os e.  So we had t o 
s it here, in t h is  dis p lac ed pers on' s c a mp ,  
in Pok i ng( ph) unt il t h
e beginning of 1949.
 
Q: Okay, now I k now and you hear d me m e nt io
n t h at when I, it 's v ery fr esh on m y  
mind, your video interview, it was these, yo
u were t h er e for f our years in t h is camp .  
It was t hes e f o ur year s t hat  I hear d t he l
east about.  Could you 
recollect as a 15 
year old, t h rough her ey es
, who you were t hen, what 
you s a w, where you s l ept,  
how y ou at e and ho
w you socialized?
 
A: Ok ay, I had j ust t ur ned 16 by t he t im e 
we got back to Germ
any in the displace d 
person's camp a
nd this  wa s another experience. 
 We were again 
in  this  army 
barrack s that did not hav e part it ions or ro
om s, indiv i dual room s.  T he only pr ivac y  
that we had, we wer e giv e n a blanket  
and a pillow there 
already and the only 
pr iv ac y  we wer e  able to m ust er  for  our s e
lves was to 
find a rope 
and tie it on 
between two nails and may b e f i
nd a few s af et y pins and wi
th these safety pins, put 
thes e blank ets  on t h es e r o pes t o s epar at e 
one family  from anoth
er.  If a person was 
snor ing r i ght next door
, you know, to you, well you just 
have to put up 
with it.  I was 
just a 15 year old little  girl
, or just turn
ed 16 and if 
I heard a couple 
who wa s next to 
us and have marital re
lationship, well that's what I had
 to listen to. 
 If there was a n  
old couple right next to us, 
they came from 
Uhzbakistan(ph), 
the backwoods of 
Russia, who knew very little 
of progress and life of today, 
having lived th
ere.  Their 
bodily noises were 
t heir lifest yle.   I mean it  was j ust
 a wf u l.  No m a
tter, I mean you 
were surrounded by people wh o lived so many differ
ent ways and you just had to 
be ar  with  it.   No w th e b ed  t
hat we slept on, it was a cot 
and army cot, this partic ular 
camp, displaced person
, displaced person's camp was 
built in  a forest because this 
too was a c onc ent rat i on c am p.
 
Q: It had been.
 
A: It had been during the 
was and s o when the war 
was ov er, t he people who 
sur v iv ed t h e c o nc entr at ion c amps liv e d 
in  these places bec
ause there we re no 
other place to go to. 
 So being in middle of a f or est,  
a lot of m i c e a
nd a lot of rats 
came into these 
barracks and so middle of the ni
ght you had a visitor.  When you 
were s l eeping on t h is  cot,  y o u j u st nev er 
knew what bit your 
hand, it  could have 
been a mous e, a field mous e or it c
ould have been a larg
e r at.  Ther e was  no 
individual toilets, there was 
I think one on each 
end of the barrac
ks and you know 
how large one of the ba
rr acks are.  And so t h is is wh
ere we would t ak e a s hower or  

stand in  line for a bathroom or for a shower. 
 And, and the food th
at we wer e given, 
excuse me, was again,
 you know, like army portions 
and that kind of stuff, but of 
cour se much m or e t h an what
 we have gotten when we 
were in the concentration 
camp.  It was alread
y a liv i ng port ion.
 
Q: Do you know who did the cooking?
 
A: At th is p o int , it was mo
r e under  the Unit ed St ates go
v er nment and s o ther e was  
a group called Unrra, 
U-n-r-r-a and t h e Join
t, J-o-i-n-t distribu
t ing committ e e an d 
they are the ones that suppl
ied the food and did some 
of the cooking for us and 
such.
 
Q: But it was no
t much better?
 
A: Well, not an awful lot better but it wa s 
at least more than 
what we hav e got t en  
before and the fact that we knew that we
 were free, that we 
could move, we could 
go, bas ic a lly dur ing the day  wher ev er  we wa
nt ed,  t hat  was  ev eryt hing bec aus e tha t  
was fr eedom.  And ther e is no
thing mor e im portant in a pe
rson's lif e, is
 just bein g 
free.
 
Q: So  when you la y there, Madd
ie( ph)  on c e rtain night s,  we
r e ther e fear s  that  you,  
your freedom might end?
 
A: W e ll t h er e were all k i nds of f ear s, th
ere were many fears 
because when you are, 
you basically just turned 16
 and already three 
years you have gone
 through all the 
hell a human being is capable of
, one is scared of everythi
ng, whether it
's the rats 
or the mice or what will be tomorrow or will
 I have anything to
 eat in these three 
days from now or am 
I going to survive a
nd get out of this ca
mp and will I have 
anot her, a normal lif e again? 
 Thes e ar e all f ears and s om e
.  Ther e are things  that I  
can't ev en think of r i ght now but  thes e wer e
 all fears.  So in 
or der t o c
ounteract 
some of these fears and 
not thin k of them and to
 occupy people, these 
or ganiz at i ons I m e nt ioned had off er ed s ome
t h ing f or people t o do 
during the day. 
One of them was s e wing, y ou know, clot
he, making clothes.
  Another one was 
dental technique to become 
a dental technician and there 
wer e t a ilors and var i ous 
ot her oc c u pations t hat they
 brought in also from th
e gr oup c a lled O RT, O- R- T, 
whic h exists even today and
 these are people who help ot
her s t h at n
eed help, to 
learn a profession and ge
t started in life again.  So t
hese are the things that have 
been off ered, t hey ar e to 
do during the day 
c aus e other w is e f or years y ou ' d go ou t  
of y o ur m i nd.
 
Q: For teenagers?
 

A: F or, f or ev er yone t hat want ed to tak e, 
you know, to try to ma
ke, start a new life  
so that whenever they will 
be allowe d anywhere in any 
country, that they can be 
good citizens, that they can do
 somet h ing or mak e som e thing.
 
Q: Did you and your mother 
spend time together during
 the day or did you go 
separate ways?
 
A: Okay, my mother  had volu
nteered and she work
ed in t h e, t h er e was  an,  lik e  a 
little hospit al and my mother
 volunteered, she al
ways  lov e d t o t a k e car e  of  people, 
so s he was  there in t h e hosp
it al during the da
y and she worked th
er e.  And I went  
to all these classes.  I lear
ned, tried to learn ho
w to sew.  I went
 to these classes 
wher e they offered dental te
chnique and I also went to
 c lass  wher e t h ey  wer e 
offering how to speak Englis h.
  So when I came to the St ates, I was able to make 
myself understood.  Of course 
not fluently, but I was at th
e point that I was able to 
communicate somewhat. 
 
Q: Did you translate for your
 m ot h er or did she als o?
 
A: Oh no, I had to translat
e for her and so it
 was def init ely helpf u l bec aus e I was  
occupied doing somethin g, 
ot her wis e, you know t he, 
all the young p e ople w ho 
surviv ed, we would hav
e gone crazy completely, there 
was  not h ing t o do, y o u k now 
and so...
 
Q: Wer e t h es e pr im ar ily Amer ic ans who wer e  teac hing?
 
A: Yes, y es ,  thes e wer e pr imar ily Am er ic ans,  right.
 
Q: Do you remember some of 
the friends t
hat  you m a de?
 
A: Yes,  I remember  some, very well, some
 of the friends that
 I made, there were 
about six of  us about
 t h e s am e age and...
 
Q: All girls?
 
A: Yeah bec a us e men and women wer e ne
ver together.  So these were girls 
about...
 
Q: Now you say they were ne
ver together , but 
if they were ma
rried, they were  
toget her ?
 
A: Never.  Men and 
wom en were separ at ed at Ausc hwit
z and t hat was t he las t  tim e  
I s a w my  f at her  and my brot
her.   I hav e never  s e en 
them.  Men and women wer e  
not t oget h er in any cam p s exc ept in Po
land or Russia, that
 was in the very 
beginning, like in 19
40 and 1941 that when they took 
the whole families together. 
And so they were taken to 
one area where 
the families were able 
together, but after 
that, especially 1944 when
 t h e Hungar i an Jews wer e  
taken away, there was n o  

such thin g.  We had neve
r seen a man from the wome
n after we separated in 
Auschwit z.
 
Q: So your memory 
of the c o uple hav i
ng marital relations?
 
A: This  wa s already in the displaced camp
s, aft er, aft er t h e war,  the displace d 
conc entr at ion c am p. 
 But not in 
the concent ration camp. 
 
Q: Right.  I'm talking 
about the displa ced.
 
A: I n t he displac e d per son'
s camp, yes, one could live.
 
Q: But you still 
had mainly girlfriends there?
 
A: W ell t here I found one of 
the girlfriends, I'
m sorry, t w o girlfriends, my t w o best 
friends from the concen
trat ion c am p I r a n int o in this
 same camp, in the displaced 
pers on' s camp.  One of t h em
 surviv ed with her mother
 and this  is the one, yo u 
mentioned my birthday book, ok
ay  s h e is  t he one t h at  gav e
 me this  little birthday 
book that we were chatting
 about here that wa
s given for my
 15th birthday, whic h 
was as I m entioned,  nine 
days  befor e t he war was ov er
.  I don't know where she 
worked in that fact
or y,  at  t h is  point, wher e s he 
was able to get 
paper and some 
fabric and a needle and 
a thread to make this little bi
rthday book for 
me, but she did 
and...
 
Q: What was her name?
 
A: Vera Goodman was 
her nam e and she...
 
Q: Was she Hungarian also?
 
A: No, s h e was fr om G erm any, Poland, t h at
 area and s h e als o had her m other an d 
I'm sure she helped he
r s urv ive as  well.   And t h e ot
her girlfriend that I had was 
called Udit(ph) or Ditka(ph) 
Kauf m an.  And s h e was  ther e 
also with her mother and 
I'm sure she helped her da
ught er survive.   
And I found them 
in the displace d 
persons camp, you know, in  
Poking(ph) and we became ag
ain, very close friends.
 
Q: Do you remember your r
eunion, where you, you have 
a big smile on your face.
 
A: Oh yes, it was a very pl
eas a nt t h ing bec ause y ou k now, 
the nicest thing that has, 
anybody has done for me th
rough the war and you know 
at the end of the war wa s  
this little birthday book.  
And the only way that I was abl
e to save tha
t, because you 
know, we were st ark nak ed all t h e t im e s o
 we couldn't save an
ything, but this was 
just nine days bef or e t he war 
and I must hav e lear ned fr om
 my mother 
to hide my 
br ead, she hid the br ead near 
the bosom and for th
ose nine days I 
kept t h at t her e 
and somehow it wasn't found.
  S o r i g ht no w it  is  in  
the, in a museum, Holocaust 
mus e um in Houst on,  on dis p lay.
 

Q: Ar e y o u in t ouch wit h
 these two women now?
 
A: No, one of them I under s
t and had died.  By t h e tim e
 I realiz ed wher e s h e liv e d 
and t h at s h e was her e  in Ho
ust o n on a v i s it ,  I found out and t hen by t he t i me I  
tracked her down from, you kn
ow,  thr o ugh New York, I f o
und out she had
 died and 
so did her husband.  So ther
e was no way that I 
could find her.  And the other one, I 
know that she marrie
d a first cousin, also
 named Kaufman and th
ey  were j u
st about 
the tim e we cam e to the Unit ed St at es, 
s h e went to Canada and s he start ed a new 
lif e t her e, but I lost
 track of her and so
 I have no idea wh
er e s h e is r i ght now.
 
Q: In t h e displac e d per son's camp wit h y o ur 
girlfriends, did you 
hav e any fr ee t im e  
toget her and if s o what ...
 
A: Oh, in the displace
d person's camp I had 
free time, the choice...
 
Q: What would y ou do, would you sing, or ?
 
A: W e ll we would get  toget h er, yes s i ng
 and talk about ti
mes when we were  
children and the hopes that we 
had that when we get out of 
this situation, that we'll 
have a home again and that we
 what will be, wh at we are 
looking forward to doing . 
And t h at was v er y im port ant bec a us e in 
a c o nc entr at ion cam p ther e wer e only  two 
things, basically one thing that kept us aliv
e.  The m a in thing t o
 get together again,  
to reunite with our fa milies.  That was the,
 my one and only im
portant thing.  And 
the ot her t h ing of cour s e, on
ce we are together
, to make a new li
fe again and have 
a new, normal lifestyle like hu
man beings would normally li
ve again.  so basically 
th is is all t h at we wer e lo
ok ing f or w ard t o.  So when we 
got toget her we were t a lk ing 
about schools in her, you kn
ow, their, one wa s, both 
of them were the, were 
orig inally from this ar
ea, that's called _________
______near where so
me of the 
camps were.  Right, 
not f ar fr om wher e t h e c onc ent rat i on c am ps wer e.  And s o...
 
Q: So t hey were v ery c l os e t o hom e?  
 
A: Yes.
 
Q: And you were how?
 
A: W e wer e quit e a dist anc e
, we were li
k e t hr ee day s and t hr e e night s on t hes e 
trains when we were taken 
ther e, you k now.  But  basic a
lly t h is is  wh at  we  wer e  
talk ing about, wh at we used
 to do when we 
were younger, schools and what, you 
know, sports and friends
hips and normal lifes.
 
Q: And what language would 
you be c omm unic at ing in?
 
A: We were speaking 
in German, believe it
 or not, because t
hes e t w o gir ls  as  I 
mentioned, wh ere they were 
born, they spoke bo
th Polis h and G e
rman.  But I, in 

school, learned how to spea
k G erm an s o all thr e e of  us
 were able 
to speak in 
German.  So that
's how we commun
ic at ed, you know.
 
Q: Did you have any religious experiences,
 was t her e any of the religion c e lebrat ed 
in these camps, or?
 
A: Yeah ther e' s, the r e li
gions were being c e lebr at ed bu
t not in the way that we 
would have liked, because ther
e were no facilities for th
at.  And t here wer e belief s 
different of different peopl
e.  Some people who surviv
ed the concentratio n camp, 
who's fam ily was ver y  obser v ant ,  ver y relig
ion, a lot of  those 
people turned away 
from God and they didn't w
ant to know anything about 
religion.  Then there were 
thos e who were not r e ligious 
at all, but after this expe
r i enc e, they  became v ery ,  
very religious and then ther
e t hose in between, who belie
v e d in G o d and pr act ic e d ,  
but within, you know, not as fanatic ally as
 perhaps the 
Orthodox Jews  or, so one 
believed in God and continued
 believed in God and observi
ng the holidays but with 
a certain fervency, you know, 
not necessarily going from one
 extreme to the other. 
And I think my mother  and I st ay ed somewh
er e in t h e middle of  t he r oad.   We, I  
guess, believed that there 
is a God, even though 
many, many people questioned 
and we also questioned when 
we found out.  But 
we , and I'm going to
 speak just for 
mys e lf bec aus e my m ot her is 
gone.  I feel that to go on
 living, I had to believe i n  
som et h ing.   Bec a us e if I be
lieve only what I 
hav e gone thr o ugh, t h rough t h is  t im e  
and if I have only belief in  
this people, that people ar
e the wa y these murderers 
were, then life is not wo
rth anything.  Then 
there is no sens
e going on, going o n  
liv i ng, t h en my m ot her  was r i
ght.  So in or der  to
, to survive and to
 go on and start a 
new life, or try to start a new
 lif e, one had to be
lieve in something 
and I guess I just 
believed t h at G od was st ill t h er e,  ev en t h ou
gh all of t h is horr or t o ok plac e a nd a l l 
these things that happened to good people, 
just because they we
re Jews.  For no 
ot her reas on.
 
Q: Wer e t h er e c ert ain pr ay ers or  songs or
 som et h ing that y o u held ont o as a n  
anchor, that your mother woul
d s a y to y ou or sing t o y o u 
or t hat  y ou s
ang with other 
people?
 
A: No, there wasn't anything 
specif ic, nothing.  The only 
thing t h at was in our mind s  
a l wa ys,  t o mak e  it 
through another day, 
make it through anot
her hour.  Just to 
mak e it thr ough s o that we c an be r e unit
ed with our families
.  That's all that 
matt er ed.   And t her e was n 't j ust  one s o ng,  
we were just holdin
g on to one another 
and tr y i ng our v er y best  to m ak e it t hr ough. 
 
Q: So there was no
, was t h er e, wer e ther e m ov i es ?
 
A: Oh no.
 
Q: In the displaced camp?
 

A: No, t her e were...
 
Q: Was t here any f orm  of ent ert a inm ent ?
 
A: T h ere wer e, som e  of t h e people who wer e 
older  t han I  of cour s e, t h at t h ey  k new 
mor e Yiddish c u lt ur e and t h ings lik e that, 
they would put on, like 
a little plays, so 
things from home, what it 
used to be like and so that 
people would try 
to remember 
what  it us ed t o be lik e wh
en life was normal and good 
and dec e nt  and wort hwhile 
and t h es e were just lit t le 
plays t h at were pu
t on, on a Saturday
 night and people,  
you know, we would go to.
 
Q: Would that be wh
er e y o u ate, t hat?
 
A:  Yeah, in like a big hall wh ere we would 
eat .  Then in t he ev
ening they would put 
the chairs in there and, in
 fact, you know, since I wa s 
so young, I k
new so little 
about t he Yiddish c ultur e, that t hr ough 
these plays I hav e lear ned a lot abo u t  
Jewishnes s  and Yiddis h cult ur e fr om way  be
fore because 
I had no oppo
rtunity to 
learn this because I went to
 school during the day and th
en I learn, ha
d the He brew 
lessons in the afte
rnoons and such or Hebrew 
reading, but not, 
t h er e was n ' t  
enough time to 
learn about the cult
ure, that would have come
 later, but I never had 
the opportunity so 
this is how I lear
ned some of it.
 
Q: Now,  how long were you at
 this camp and I k
now it was a very involved proces s 
back  and f o rth.
 
A: Well basic ally from 19, ea
rly 1946 until 1949
, so it 's almost 
four years and that 
was f o ur y e ars of m y lif e on t o p of the 
c onc ent rat i on  cam p, what ev er , it was gon e .  
I mean this is  my, all my t
een years were gone
.  When most young 
girls at the age 
of 13 are at puberty and th
ey're learning about friends
hips and doing things and 
rela tionships with other people their age 
and doing things t oget h er and lear nin g  
about lif e and I had none of t h
at.  So when I came to th
e Unit ed St at es, when I ha d 
already turned 18
, I was really not 
18, I was still a 13 year ol
d girl in th
e body of an 
18 year old.
 
Q: Befor e y ou arr i ve over here
, I know that t he pr oc ess of
 the letters ba
ck and fort h 
must have been 
fraught with responsibilities. 
 
A: It was terrible bec a us e f or alm ost f o ur y e
ars this has been goi ng on.  Either my 
mother would go to 
Munich, to the office, you know, 
of the governmen
tal off ic e and 
trying to find out ha
v e they hear d anyt hing.  Then 
she would come back, the next 
week I would make t h e s am e trip and try i ng
 to find out and this
 has been going o n  
for y e ars and y ear s unt i l we wer e alr eady 
going out of our minds
 because we didn't 
know if or when we'll ev er be able to get 
out of there.  And to
 live in this barracks 
that I described to yo
u, with the mice an
d with the rats and 
no privacy, I mean 

anim als should not live the wa
y we had to liv
e for almost four year s.  It was horr ible. 
But the only good thin g was that we were
 free, you know.  Bu
t anything else you 
know, it was just horrible, horrible experi
ence.  And for a you
ng girl especially .
 
Q: How did you receive your mail?
 
A: The only mail that we re
ceiv ed was, went 
into the main offi
ce, the headquarters 
of t he c am p and t h en onc e a 
day  we would go ther e and 
if anybody got mail, they 
would r e ad it out, y o u k now.
 
Q: How oft en did y o u r ec e iv e m a il?
 
A: Somet im es it came once a day, som e
t im e s y ou got onc e a 
week, sometimes it  
took from the United St ates
 to get, a month, you know
, mail wa s not very good in 
the 1940's.
 
Q: But you got mail 
on a regular basis?
 
A: Well, if you can call it regular, you know.
 
Q: Fr om whom ?
 
A: The only person, that
 was  my  mot her ' s s i ster,  her e. 
 And she's the 
on ly one that  
she, t h ey would let us know t hat  t hey went
 to, let's say to Pitts
burgh, because they 
lived in Pennsylvania an
d trying to find ou
t what's happening with
 our papers and all 
of t hat .  But  that' s t he only m a il we 
got, there was nobody el
se in this world.
 
Q: Was she also receiving mail from you?
 
A: She got  the m a il fr om us
, right.  And all we could wr
it e is please try to go to 
Pitts bur gh and what ev er off ic e s y ou have to,  
to see if  y o u c ould put  a litt le pus h on 
it, bec a us e we are 
going crazy here.
 
Q: So when it finally hap
pened, how did you feel?
 
A: We couldn't, really couldn
't ev en believ e it any m or e,  
aft er four y ears, you k now,  
living like this.  You couldn't 
believe it, we didn't know w
hat to even expect, so that 
when we finally
 came on that ship, 
the SS Marine F l as her.
 
Q: The what?
 
A: That 's was t h e nam e of it, t he SS M ar i
ne Flasher.  And when
 we arr iv e d in N e w 
York harbor and saw 
the St atue of Liberty and we go
t off the boat, we  kissed the 
good old Americ an soil, beca
us e now we k new t h at we we
re finally free.  And that 
was a very special experience, 
a very special,
 special day.
 
Q: I want to hear about  that day, but the day
 that you or the last
 week that y ou wer e  
preparing, were 
there people that 
you cared enough to
 say good-bye to?
 

A: Well of  course when you're
 together with them for al
most four  years, you know,  
you m ak e f r iends and you, y o u ar e a hum
an being s o y ou int e
rrelate with people 
who live r i ght next to y ou or, 
you know, make spec ial rela
tionship with others.  And 
of c o urs e we part ed
 company and wished each other 
well.  We had no idea what 
was wait ing f or us  or what  
wa s wa it in g f or  th em.  S o we
 were look ing f or ward t o  
starting a new life, but we
 wer e also scar ed silly.
 
Q: How did you get from 
the camp to the boat?
 
A: Well, from the camp to 
the boat, we were in Br emerha
v e n( ph),  whic h 
is  the port ,  
that's the German port, so 
we  were taken there, oh 
I think about a week or so 
befor e t h at  and we wer e in 
big, big barracks and that's
 wher e we were
 kept until 
this ship was 
ready for us.
 
Q: And did you, was it unc o
mfortable on the ship or?
 
A: O h, who car e d at t h at poin
t ?  At that point we k new 
that we wer e com i ng alread y  
to the United Stat es and y o u k now, we ar e 
looking f or war d to it, 
we didn't know, we 
were v ery  anxious and v er y ant icipat ory,  
but also with hope. 
 You have to hav e  
hope in order to go
 on.  So  we  we re hoping
 for to be able to st
art a new,  decent lif e  
again.  
 
Q: Did y o u br ing anyt hing wit h you, any it em
s that were very special to your family ? 
 
A: Well I had nothing t hat 
surviv ed, becaus e when we were taken to Auschwit z, we 
were stripped naked and ever
ything was taken away from
 us.  So I had nothing 
from bef or e .  The only  thing that I  had and 
that I held onto and 
I just gave to the  
Holocaust museum here
 in Houston, was my
 little birthday boo
k that was given t o  
me j ust nine days bef o re t he war was 
ov er.  And t h at 's 
all I kept and...
 
Q: I just wonder ed if t he hom e t hat y ou 
ret ur ned t o, where t h er e were neighbors  
who had taken ov er s o r udel
y ,  ther e was nothing t h er e 
from t h at land ar ound th e 
warehouses or anything, 
other than the money?
 
A: No, becaus e.
 
Q: No j e welry?
 
A: No,  ther e was  s om e
 jewelry and some
 m oney t h at my f at her  hid and t hat ' s wha t  
we did f i nd and t h at 's what  helped 
us get out  of t here at the t ime.
 
Q: You had to sell the jewe lr y?
 
A: The jewelry we had to sell
, but  not at this point y et, t h
is we sold at a later date, 
but the money, the cash money that my fath
er hid, is what we
 had used to pay off, 
you know, these guards, the border gu
ar ds s o we c ould get out of t here.
 

Q: So arr iv i ng, or ?
 
A: Arriving in New York wa
s fantabulous.  Our aunt a
nd uncle showed us around 
Times Square, a million li ghts 
and everything else and it wa
s very, very 
im pressive.  
We st ayed her e ov er night in one of t h e, 
t h e T aft Hot e l, in Ne w Y ork, o n T i mes  
Square.  And so 
it was v er y exc it i ng and v er y ni
ce, but we were 
so worn and so 
worn and tired from all the excitement that 
we co u l d h ar d ly  wa it  
to be taken to their 
home and so we  could get 
some rest and decent, a 
good night's sl
eep and being 
somewhere.  A new
 home.  A hom e.
 
Q: What was the name of 
y o ur aunt who met  y ou?
 
A: Magda.   Her f irst  name is Magda 
and s h e mar r ied a 
young man, Ado l ph 
Bergstein(ph), just 
bef o re t h ey came.  You know my
 uncle, her husb
and, came wit h  
his family in the 1920's, thro
ugh Ellis Island and he went 
back to visit his hometown 
in 1937 and that 's wher e he m et my mot h er
' s s ist er, who was a v er y, v ery beaut if ul 
21 year old gir l.  And they f e
ll in love with each other and they got married and then, 
just in beginning of ' 3 9, 
bef ore t he war br oke out, t
hey, you know, came to the 
United St ates.  I mean he
 was here, but al
r eady, beginning of ' 39 t her e wer e  
problems, they didn't want 
people to come out and
 so on.  So he 
had to actually 
ret urn t o Eur ope and t ak e c ar e of  her paper
s so that they would 
let her go.  So that 
they cam e out just bef
or e the war  br ok e out .
 
Q: Was there anyt hing about arr iv i ng in Am er
ica t h at y o u r ec a ll, ev en a ver y little 
thin g, that was differ
ent from how you thought it  might
 be?  You'd had 
so much time 
to dream.
 
A: Yeah, I think the expect at
ions perhaps were a little  
bit bigger.  You know, when 
we arr iv e d we t h ought  that the hom es wer e
, all of the buildings
 would be like the 
skyscrapers, everything would 
be huge, like descri
bed in Am er ic a, 
everything would 
be very, v e ry big.  So this 
was s o mewhat of a, not s o 
much a disappoi
ntm e nt, j ust  
mor e of a diff er enc e 
than what we thought.
 
Q: What about the food?
 
A: W e ll t he food t o ok som e gett ing used t o
, but for awhile we 
stayed in my aunt, 
you k now,  my m ot her ' s s i st er
 and she did do a lot of Hung
arian cooking ye
t, so that 
was okay.  One thing that I w
ould lik e to m e nt ion at this 
point , whic h carr
ies on into 
later life is this, w
hen we arrived in  this  small town
 and this was a small mining town 
called Manas sen( p h) Pennsy l vania, not far fr om Pitt s bur gh.  And t h ey, m y aunt  an d 
unc l e had a sm all house t h er
e, they had a gr oc er y st or
e and he ma de a nic e living 
and t h ey  lived a comf ort able lif e and t h ey
 had made a lot of 
good friends.  And 
about t w o weeks aft er  we arr i v
ed there, m y aunt want ed us 
t o m eet her fr iends.   So  
she made a little party, sh
e gathered, you know, invited 
all her friends and we were 

just  talk ing bec aus e as  I me
ntioned, my English was such
 that I could carry on a 
conv er s at ion.  So when s h e had inv it e d 
t hes e fr iends, s ev er a l of t h em as ke d m e  
certain questions pertaining 
to the Holocaust a
nd I, you know, I ex
plained to them 
in simple, short way and it
 seem ed t o m e like human 
beings, being int er est ed in 
ot her hum an beings.   And I f e lt that was 
natural and felt it was warm and felt 
welc om e.  Unt i l one of  her fr iends  said 
t h at, " Y ou k now, that' s enough co nv er s at ion 
about that Holo caust al
ready, let's just forget about it
. "  And t h at was  lik e a knif e 
being stabbed, you know, in  
my heart.  This is, we ar
e j ust aft er  the Holoc aus t  
being over.  11 million people 
were killed. 
 Innocent peopl
e were killed and this is 
just 1949, four years later 
and people are first co
ming to the, from these camps and 
a few here, a few there.  So many million 
peoples were killed fo
r nothing and the n  
she says let's not t a lk about it an
y more.  It was de
v as t at ing to m e.
 
Q: This is the end of
 T ape 1, Side B.
 
End of Tape 1.
 

 Tape2
 
Q: Now y o u' v e just ar rived in
, outside of Pittsburgh with
 your aunt, you and your 
mother and you've met a few of
 her friends and your rela
tionship with your mother 
in this case must have been very clos
e becaus e y o u were t h e two, the only tw o 
who k new, out of all t h os e ot her pe
ople.  Could y o u t alk about t h at?
 
A: Ye s, o ur  re lat i o ns h ip, I m
ean we were so, we 
couldn't be closer if
 we tr ie d.  We  
could just look at 
one another and 
understand the ot
her person, what goes on in 
the ot her one' s mind.  We wer e in this 
sm a l l t o wn, M a na ss en (p
h) with my m other 's  
sist er, f or a short  t ime,  a ver y short dur a
t ion, from t h e M arc h,
 beginning of Mar c h 
when we  arrived until the four
th of July when we went 
up to New York to visit a 
couple of my mother's cousin
s and an aunt wh o came al
so in the 1920's and my 
mot her  of c ours e, didn' t  s e e t h em so we de
cided that we would go
 to visit them in 
New York  for a few days.  And when 
we were talking 
about, you know, 
Manassen(ph), this small town
 wher e m y aunt lived and 
m y age being just 18 and 
that ther e was r eally ver y li
ttle for me to do 
in this small town. 
 So we had many 
conf er enc e s wit h t he c ous ins 
and the aunt that we
 had t here and t h
ey adv is e d that 
instead of stayin g in Pennsyl
vania t hat we stay in Ne
w York ins t ead, wher e we 
have a better chance of st
arting a new life, whether it
's going back to school or 
work ing or t he c om b ination or what ev er.  
You see, I had a probl
em, a v er y, v er y  big 
pr oblem when I c ame t o the 
United States, cause as I 
m entioned befor e, alt h ough I  
already wa s 18 years old, I 
was really just 13
.  Because I haven'
t learned anythin g  
between the age of 13 and 18. 
 Plus t h e fact I  was st ill 
sc ar ed of ev erything.  Liv i ng 
in these camps, whethe
r it 's a c oncentr at ion c am p or 
later in the disp
laced person's 
camp, and I ne
ver had a normal relation
ship with people.  Th
is was not a normal 
lifestyle that I had all 
t hese year s,  so I  was scar ed sill
y of ev er yt hing.  I als o did not  
have a good working relation
ship with people 
my age, because we  had nothing in 
common.  Those girls that 
I met through the family, 
at age 18 were dating an d 
going to t h e mov ies and t h eat er s  and all of
 that, all those thin
gs we re unknown to 
me.  T h ey were t a lk ing about
 boys and all, you know, th
e dat ing and all that .  It 
meant nothing to me.  
Even when I got my first j ob, 
through the family, my stomac h 
was so nervous just 
getting on the subway
 in New York and goi
ng to work and not 
to know wh at to expect ther
e,  all t he unk nowns,  ev eryt
hing that was unknown was 
so scary t h at the f ir st seve
ral years and I'm not talkin g 
about m ont hs, f ir st s ev er a l  
year s, I was having a real 
hard time.  I couldn't go 
out  on a date,  th
at, that was 
foreign to me, it was 
ver y scar y.   As I  
said, when going to 
a job was ve
ry, very 
sc ary.   M e et ing people, in gener a l, was sc
ary.  And in
 Pennsylv
ania, in this small 
town, one of the t h ings that 
k ept m e from st ay ing t h er e wa
s t h at the childr en, or the 
young people that were my ag
e were not Jewish and so 
I had, again, 
nothing in  
comm on with t hem becaus e and es pec i ally no
t just that they we
re not Jewish but 
they wer e not in a c o nc entr at
ion camp, they were 
not living in DP 
cam ps, t heir lif e  

was completely differ
ent.  Or they were 
very young children, 
s o t h er e was nobod y  
for me to have 
relationships with.  Or 
understanding 
one another.
 
Q: Except your mother?
 
A: Except my mot h er.   But 
no, no people my age, so I 
had r eally noth
ing to do in 
th at sm a l l t o wn.  S o whe n 
we went to New York and we
 were t a lk ing about thes e 
things, the, you know the good
 sense was that ye
s, we should stay in New York. 
So which we did, we stayed 
with this  aunt at 
first, for a short wh
ile, then we rented 
a, a furnished room, 
where we stayed for 
awhile.  Then we go
t our first apartment, 
whic h at that time wa s like im
possible to get, 
but wh at we had g
one through in lac k  
of pr iv ac y that I des cr i bed t o y ou, that
 was the only thing, 
now that we had our  
freedom, that wa s the only
 t hing my mot h er and I wa
nted and I'm sure all the 
Holocaust survivor
s, some pr ivacy.
 
Q: What did s h e do t o earn t h is?
 
A: So my mother, her
 cousins found her a 
job, again taking ca
re of people because 
that' s what she was alway s
 best at.  So sh
e was work ing in an old age hom e, a  
nursing home and so she wa s making money th
ere.  And I we nt to
, to work in one 
of t he fact or ies, again a 
c o us in, where they t aught 
me how t o  work a sewin g  
machine and so I was maki
ng some money there and th
en I finally met a youn g 
man, an Amer ic an born c o llege gr aduat e
 and he somehow talk
ed me into goin g 
back to school, because
 my family wanted me to and 
I still saw school anti-Semit ic 
in everything the way it was 
back  in Eur o pe,  so I didn't 
want t o go back .  So t h is  
friend, this young man that I 
met, said, "I tell you what, 
you sign up an
d I will come 
with you."
 
Q: Can I ask you how, under what ci
rcumstances you met this friend?
 
A: Yes.  After, as I said, 
for several years I wa s not very
 good socially
 with anybody 
here, but one of t h e c ous ins in t he f am ily
 used to go away 
on weekends or on 
vacations to the mountain
s wh ere they had single grou
ps, you know, where they 
would m eet .  And in one week en
d, she talked me in
t o it and I went 
with her.  And I 
met this young man there 
and somehow it seemed li
ke he had empathy an d 
understanding of what I 
have gone through and he
 knew a lot about the 
conc entr at ion c am ps and all t h at
, so we sort of hit it off.
  And so I st
arted to go out 
with him, you know, with 
other people, with
 other young peopl
e because alone I 
was st ill scar edy- baby.  But  
anyway, so he talk
ed me into going 
back to 
school and 
he s a id, well of c o ur se only
 in the evening becau
se during th
e day I worked.  So he 
would sit with me in
 the evening, in the school for I 
t h ink maybe s i x m o nt hs or s o  
until I got used to i
t, then I saw that school
 her e was not the s am e as ant i- S emit ic  
schools that I had to
 go through be
fore we were
 taken away.
 

Q: What did you fear in
 this school might happen?
 
A: Ba sically the hatred of the Jews  and 
you know, what happe
ned was in Europe, 
then when I went t o s c hool, if 
I deser v ed an A or a B, I 
would get may b e a D,  jus t  
pass ing gr ades, y o u know.  And s o it 's, it
 was very scary.  
Again, among those 
things that were very, very
 scary.  But finally I stayed
 in school and while I was 
there is wher e I met m y hus ba
nd to be.  This other fellow
 took me ther
e, but I met 
my hus b and to be t here, wh
o wa s also a Holo caust surv
ivor and who lost all his 
family there.  
 
Q: Could you tell me what
, what sc hool and wher e?
 
A: Yes, that was Theodore 
Roosevelt evening high school
 in the Br onx, New York, 
acr o ss t h e street fr om For dham Univ ers it y.
 
Q: So was he in a cl
ass together, ____________?
 
A: We were not in 
the same class, but he heard 
me speak Hungar
ian to someone 
there and s o t hat ' s how he 
asked me if he could drive 
m e hom e and he s eemed lik e  
a nice enough young man and ma
ybe by that time I was gett
in g, warming up a little 
bit that I wasn't quite as 
sc ar ed as I was t he f irst 
few years because this was 
already 1955, you know, so 
this is  six years la ter.
 
Q: And you were then how old?
 
A: At this point I was 25, 
I had j ust turn
ed 25, yeah.
 
Q: It must have been 
such a thrill to meet som
eone who you had 
so much in 
common with.
 
A: Yes, definitely.  This was something, that we had a lot in comm on with and...
 
Q: Wer e you act u ally able to appr oa
c h t he s u bject of t he Holoc aust ?
 
A: Oh yes, oh yes.  
 
Q: Could you tell me a 
little bit about that?
 
A: T hat  was one of  the f ir s
t things that  we talk ed a
bout, because when you meet 
som eone, y ou tr y to f ind things that y ou 
hav e in c omm on.  And of  cours e what di d 
we have in comm on more th
an having been in the concentr
at ion c a mps,  hav ing los t  
all our families, trying to ma
ke a new life for 
ourselves and how we
 are going abou t  
trying to do that.  
And then my hus b and was also in 
Korea.  No sooner that h e  
arr iv e d t o t he Unit ed St ates
, he was, he was taken, yo
u know, to the Korean war, 
front lines.  And so things of
 this sort, that we were, 
had a lot in c omm on wit h an d 
talk ed about.  An d, now of 
cour s e  we spoke about what  
we would like 
in our lives, 
now that we are here
 and we would li ke, we should tr
y to put the past behind us 

and tr y to st art a new lif e and per h aps hav
e c h ildr en and you k now, to live a nor m a l  
life again.  Try to forget all those years,
 what we hav e gone t h
r ough and ev eryt hing 
and ever y o ne that we hav e lo
st.  And so all of 
these things were things that we had 
in common.  An d we both
 wanted to, you know, s
peak Englis h better and you 
know, try to do the very be
st we can with what we ha
d.  I mean 
we were young 
kids.
 
Q: You said you were from diffe
rent parts of 
Hungary, but...
 
A: Yeah, but not terribly 
far away, because wh ere I 
was bor n is,  was Hungary ,  
Cz echoslo vakia, the northeaste
r n  part of Hungar y, while 
my husband is what they 
call the Transylvania area, wh
ich is Hungary, Romania.  
But those were
 like 50, 60 
miles away from one another.
 
Q: And he lost both
 of  his par ent s ?
 
A: O h, he lost his par ents, his br ot her s, his 
sist ers, his aunt s, un
cles cousin s.  We 
both as well as all the other
 people, lost at least 90 percen
t of our families.  So he 
was all alone.
 
Q: Your heart must have 
really gone out to him.
 
A: Yeah, because he 
had no one, yeah.
 
Q: And so that wa s touc
hing you a great deal.
 
A: Yeah, yes.
 
Q: And he and your m ot her, 
did they also
 meet and?
 
A: And he and m y m o ther hit  
it off beautifully,  even after we were marr ied for years,  
they got along so well.  
My husband had a tr
emendous amount of
 respect for my 
mother and my mother had ve
ry much respect 
for him because, 
not only because 
he tr ied to work so hard and
 to establis h a life and hav
e c h ildr en and a y o u know,  
fam i ly lif e and t a k ing car e 
of me, but just the fact that
 he was tr ying t o har d in  
everything and to pleas
e her and to please me
 and to just try to 
make a good 
life f or 
all of us, yeah.
 
Q: I'll say now t her e j u st se
ems to be, we're approaching 
your m arr iage I  k n ow and 
the story of t
hat and you've alre
ady talk ed to me a little
 bit about, but there was so 
muc h  joy on t he one ha
nd and then on the other 
t h er e were  f l as hback s  
____________ how you bala
nced the two of those things
, the past, the present and 
the hopes of the future?
 
A: Okay.  Oh, is it  
going?  Well, basically 
at this point, now th
is is, we're talkin g 
about end of 1955, we
 were planning ou
r wedding, which was 
February 4th, 1956 

and we had a sm all apartm ent bec aus e it 
was still very diffic
ult to get anything 
bigger or better in the Br onx
.  And we both were going 
to work.  My 
m ot her  liv ed 
just a couple of blocks away 
from us and so we saw eachother almost, qui
te often. 
She would invited us for di
nner, you know, a
fter work and on 
Sundays we spent 
time together and some of 
course with just friends. 
 But we, our relationshi p  
remained very, 
v ery clos e wit h m y mot h er.  Then t w
o y ears later, I  ha
d a litt le boy,  
Mark and at the same
 time, when my oldest son was bor
n, my mother remarried. 
And t hat  is  an inter e st ing st
ory because, of cour
se, she wasn't look
ing at this  point 
to get  married, we we
re still in a lot of 
pain and we were not th
inking and she surely  
wasn't thin king about, yo
u know, gettin g married again.
  The pain was still quit e 
deep and strong there.  Bu
t this same sister in Penns
ylvania had good
 friends a nd 
one of t hem knew about this
 gentleman who had lo st hi
s wif e just sever a l year s 
prior.  And he wa
s born in the village ri
ght next to where we 
lived back home.  An d 
so she thought that maybe the 
two of them could hit it o
ff.  And so they invited my 
mot her , y o u know,  down t o 
Pennsylvania and th
ey met and it se
emed to have 
worked very nicely , he wa s 
a v er y , ver y nic e man and 
he was lonesom e, you know, 
he had lost his wife and my 
mother wa s alone, basically. 
 I mean, she lived near us, 
but still she was alone.  An
d they got married, that sa
me time when my first son 
was bor n.  And t h ey  m ov e d, y o u 
know, she moved to
, wh ere he lived.
 
Q: So she moved to Pennsylvania?
 
A: She moved to Pennsyl
vania this point and they had a 
very nice life 
for five years 
and t h en they went t o  Miam i, t o one of his  niec e's 
weddings and while t h ey wer e  
there in a hotel that they we
re staying in , he had a heart
 attack and died in front of 
her.  So the poor woman, no
t enough that she 
had to surviv e all she had to surviv e 
and lose everybody, it
, like five, six years later, sh
e, same thing 
have to happen 
again.  So  that was 
a dev as t at ing t im e.  And we m a de
 her move in  with us because 
we didn't want her to be alon
e.  And at t his  point, y o u 
know, we had a little baby 
and s o we were t ak i ng care
 of  a child and my m other  
was living with us and we 
liv e d a v ery  good, nor mal life
.  And you know, you're busy
 with a child, 
you tend t o 
not focus s o muc h of t he pas
t, you tend to live one day  at
 a t im e in tak i ng care of  
the child, enjoying it and have
 a good married li
f e an d  it  wa s j u st
, the first time I 
think that some of this stuff was not tho
ught of every single day. 
 The only time that 
it did happen, that we  would 
think about it of course is  
both of us and most of the 
sur v ivor s, I 'm sur e, have 
gone through tha
t, is wher e we w
ould have s o me 
nightm ar es  that t h ings  would come bac k 
from the past.  The slightest little thin g 
could s et off nightm ar e, y o u k now.  You w
ould s ee a pers on in a unif orm.  Didn' t  
hav e t o be a polic e, 
it  didn't have to be anything li
ke that, but it 
would trigger off 
som et h ing.   And t hen of c our s e at nigh
t you would have these 
horrible nightmares 
and y o u' d be s cr eam ing on top of your  
lungs and jump
 up and the perspiration  
pouring off your body becaus
e you're actually reliving th
is.  And this has been gone 

for many, many years.  In the first years,
 much more often than 
in lat er y e ars ,  but  
even now, occasionally it will
 happen.  My husban
d, many times that he feels that 
he' s f i ght ing bac k, y ou k now,  
when he would wake
 up all in a c old s w eat .  But as  I  
said, this is now on 
a rare occasion, but for several 
y e ar s this was a pat ter n and we 
ac cept ed that this is how it is .
 
Q: When you had these night
mares and you would wake
 up in the morning and 
rem ember, did y ou repeat
 what you had dr eamed?
 
A: Yeah, we repeated it basically to on
e another and then tr
ied to go on and you 
know, try not to thin
k about it much and 
this is the good part, 
you know, that we 
tried our best to start anew. 
 Tried our best not 
to think much of 
what took place, 
what happened.  But of course 
you can't just get ri
d of years, years 
of pain, years of 
suffering.  It jus
t, you know, we tried.
 
Q: Were you living
 ar ound a lot of ot her s urv iv ors ?
 
A: Not really.  Ther
e were a couple of good friends 
that we had an
d we  are still 
friends with them although
 they are in  Ne w York, one 
in New York and one in 
Color ado.  We ar e, you know
, still constantly 
in touc h with them.  They were the 
only ones that were really, 
we did any talk ing about. Wh
en, again, when we would 
see som et h ing,  that would tr i
gger things off.  We 
were not trying to
 talk about these 
things, we would try to 
get it out of our  syst em s 
and you know, you t r y to 
concentrate, they had little
 children, we had little ch
ildren.  You know two years 
after my first one was born, I 
had another little boy.  And 
we tr ied t o  liv e as nor m a l 
life as possible, but occasional
ly things, we would see, an
d it happens today.  I'll 
see something and it will tr
igger off something that I 
have seen 50 some odd, you 
know, years ago.
 
Q: Did I ask about your feelin g 
about how to talk to your 
children, whether or not to 
tell y o ur c h ildr en or when
 to tell yo
ur children?
 
A: Well this is a very difficu
lt  and individual thin
gs t o do.  Most of us  surv ivor s were 
not able to talk  to our 
children about our ex
periences, about wh
at happened, for a 
number of year s.  I 
don't know what the reason was,
 I guess basically most of us 
believe t h at  we didn't want , wa
nt  to hurt our  ch
ildren, we didn't wa
nt them to live 
through the things that
 we have lived 
t hr o ugh.  I n ot her  wor ds we were try i ng to 
protect them.  Not like a, 
a, a lion cub but 10
 times more.  Because that was the 
thing and I think ou
r pr oblem st ill is, thos e of us t hat
 surviv ed and we
 have children, 
we bec am e ov er pr ot ect i ve.  Sometimes  
to the point  wher e it 's  har m ful.  
Nevertheless, that's 
how it is, you know. 
 
Q: And this was one of the number one wa
ys you would overly
 protect, by not 
telling them anything?
 

A: That was...
 
Q: Did they ever ask you or
 hear about it
 in school?
 
A: Well later on, when
 they wer e a litt le bigger and t h
ey  started t o as k if t hey saw 
cert ain things t h at we would r ead or if t h
ey  ov er hear d us t a lk t o thes e c o uple o f  
friends, you know, about certain things, th
ey would ask questions
, but that's about 
all and we would giv e them a v er y s imp
le answer and not going int o too muc h  unt il 
muc h lat er.   No w, wh e t h er th is wa s th e rig h
t thing or wrong thing, I don't know.  In 
our c a se,  of c our s e t h ey  have lear ned m u c h
 more later, becaus
e I did not, we did  
not talk much about it until,
 let's see, 1978.  This was 
when we already
 lived in a 
different home in New City, 
New York, which is upstate, in Rockland County.  At 
this point we had a very beauti
ful one family home and we li
ved a, the nicest time of 
our lives s i nc e the c oncentr at ion c am p took 
plac e ther e, in the s e
v en  year s that we 
liv e d t h er e.   W e had t he boys,  t h ey  had fr
iends, we had friend
s, we had a lovely  
home and so it was j ust  a ver y
, very nice lifestyle.
  But we still, th
e friends knew that 
we went  t h rough t h e c onc ent rat i on cam p 
and occasionally so
mething would come 
up, we would talk about it 
a little bit.  Some
t im es our childr en hear d about it  and 
we' l l ans w er them but not goi
ng into detail.  
My children learned 
much more starting 
in 1978 when we were
 living here in New City, the ra
bbi from the temple wher e we 
belonged to, is a conservati
ve rabbi, asked 
anot her  lady  and my s elf if  we would pu t  
together a Holo caust re
membrance progra
m  in  Apr i l,  wh ic h  wa s, y o u kn o w,  th e  Da y  
of Remem br anc e, c a lled Yom Has hewah( p h)
 and I was t a ken ba
ck a little bit 
because as I said, we really 
didn't talk about it 
as s u ch, but this ot her lady that  he 
as ked and I sat down and we
 did put t oget h er a r em e mbr anc e pr ogram and that  
was pr es ented on t h e Day of Remem br
ance, Yo m Ha shewah(
ph), 1978.  And...
 
Q: And how old would yo
ur sons have been?
 
A: Well one was born 
in '60, 1960, the ot
her one was born
 in 1958.  So this  was 
already about 20, 18 
and 20.  
So they...
 
Q: Then they 
were there?
 
A: And t hey wer e ther e, as 
wer e most of the, a lot of 
the Jewish people from th e 
town , you know.  And they ha
ve heard a lot there and then
 that October,  that  same 
year is when we m o ved t o 
Houston, wher e immediat ely 
I got involved with the 
Holo caust surviv ors group wh
ich was forming at that pa
rtic ular time here in 
Houst on.  So we m ov ed dow
n in 79 and a c ouple of m ont
hs lat er I was very muc h  
involv ed already in the Holo
c aust  sur v iv or s gr oup t h at 
we put together and from 
then on, bec a us e of t he t hings  t hat I ha
ve been doing since 1
980 is  wh ere they 
really have learned everyt
hing about the Holo
caust and they have
 learned quite a 
bit, about our physical expe
riences, about our emot
ional experiences, our 

relationship with other su
r v iv ors and t hey t hems e lv es
 understand much more,  
people who have been in the 
concentration camps and lo
st everything, so they 
hav e gained a tr em endous am
ount of knowledge of what 
took place and what we 
ar e liv i ng with, all as s u rv iv ors.
 
Q: So we're going back
 a little bit to?
 
A: Well basically when we started out 
in the Br onx and wh
ere we had a on e 
bedroom apartment and my firs
t son was about a y ear and 
a half old, we moved to 
Queens, we bought a two fami
ly home and we 
hoped that we 'll 
be able to support 
it, both of us
 working and...
 
Q: You didn't  ment ion your work ?
 
A: That t i me I was only 
working, you know in a fa
ctory because I didn't know 
anything else, but after I we
nt back to school in the ev
ening, I changed my job and I 
worked in an office 
and I was working in offi
ce until I got, until 
my first son was born, 
so I was work ing t h ere.
 
Q: And your husband's job?
 
A: An d my hu s ba n d was in th
e frozen food distributing 
line f or many, m a ny y ears .  
In f act f or, he worked for 
one c o mpany f or 22 y e ars.   So
 we lived in Laurelt on(ph),  
whic h was  a nice family -or i ent e d t o wn.  
The street we live
d on, there were 21 
families with 
children more or less 
the sam e  age, s o our 
children had good friends 
and t h ey didn't know mu
ch about our 
past at this age, yo
u know, young age.
 
Q: Was this a Jewish communit y, or ?
 
A: It was quite a, t h er e were 
quite a bit of Jews, in fact
 I think most of the people 
who lived on our block, the 
21 families, I think most of
 them were Jewish, so the 
children had a lot in 
c omm on,  when they  st art ed Hebr
ew s c hool and things of t h a t  
sort.
 
Q: Bar Mitzvahs?
 
A: And the Bar Mitzvahs, yo
u know, they went to each 
ot hers Bar Mi
tzvahs, Bat 
Mitzvahs, they had all their birthdays together and it
 was a very 
quiet, beautiful 
lif est y le, we liv e d ther e for 
13 year s and it was s omething 
that, it was go
od f or all o f  
us, because we didn't thin k much or talk  
much about 
our past, but liv
ed our present 
and tr y ing t o raise our  child
ren and so it was good f or 
us, f or t he childr en it was 
good because they had 
all their friends and they were 
doing t hings t oget her, s o tha t  
was a good lifesty l e f or t hem
.  And then the neighborho
od started to change an d 
people were moving in  and ou
t and was getting very unsta
ble and the ch
ildren were 
hav i ng s om e problems  in t he s chools.  T h
eir  lunc h m oney was 
taken away and all 

of these things, so the area
 started to change and we  de
cided it was ti
me to mov e  
on and at that point we had 
s om e fr iends who moved, who 
lived in a very beautiful 
ar ea up in Roc k land Coun
ty, New City, to be 
spec if ic and they t a
lk ed us into goin g 
up there to look around and 
we fell in love 
wit h the ar ea and we
 found a beautiful 
one f am i ly home t h ere and 
s o we made t he mov e and 
again we wer e v ery happ y  
there.  The boys wer e  in sc
hool, in high school and 
they were, had good friends 
and we made some very 
good friends through the si
sterhood and the Jewish 
cent er.  And we lived ver y nic e ly,  ver y c o
mfortably and talk ing ve
ry little 
about our 
past.  Trying to just 
liv e  in t he pr es ent.  
 
Q: I jus t  want ed t o as k 
that, was this also a large Jewish communit y?
 
A: No, t h is was a f a ir ly  ne w c om m u nity 
per se and s o t here 
were Jews and non-
Jews as well, but we 
f e lt t hat the boys  wer e at an 
age wher e t h ey  would be going,  
you know to Hebrew school and
 such that it  would be good
 for them to be involv ed 
and f or us  t o be inv o lv ed s o t hat we
 can do things t
ogether and so on.
 
Q: To be involved in?
 
A: In a, a nice lifestyl
e where they can learn about
 more Judaism and being 
educat ed in the J e wis h  religion and lear n 
more about their past, 
per se, I mean not 
so much what happened to as as to, more to k
now about Judaism. 
 You know, like 
religious celebrations and r
eading, how to read 
He brew and things 
of that nature.
 
Q: Ar e t h er e t im es when y ou lear ned als o ?
 
A: Well in a way I learne
d, I  did not t ak e  any  for m
al Hebrew education there 
bec aus e, well I  don' t  k now,  bec a us e.  
But I had some Hebr
ew education when I 
was going in in school
 in Europe, you know
, before we were ta
ken away and so I  
was not in volv ed per se in 
theirs, except supervisin g t
hem that they are doing their 
work and like a mot her, a good
 mother's supposed to do.  
B ut th is is whe n we  wer e  
there, wher e we liv e d in New 
City and t h en in 1978 is wh
en t h e r abbi as ked us if we 
would, you know, make th
is program f or Yom Hashew
ah( ph) and t h at' s wher e I  
start e d a new c areer f or my se
lf  so to speak, because  
f e w mont hs later we m ov ed 
from t here t o T e xas, where I got v ery m u ch
 involved in the Ho
loc a us t sur v iv or s an d 
then I can t e ll y ou a litt le bi
t m or e of what I hav e done 
s i nc e 1980, since I live her e  
in Texas.  
 
Q: Yeah.  I'm  r eally  look ing f o rwar d t o 
it, I think befor e that, maybe to your 
relationship with your mother , also your moth
er's health took a turn during this time.  
 
A: Yes, yes.
 
Q: I may have to stop us because we'll 
have to go to anothe
r side, but you ca n 
begin now.
 

A: Okay, okay.  When
 my m other  was m arr ied, as 
I said that her husband had died 
in front of her, she 
was devastated and we ma
de her  m ov e in t o, in
 with us.  And at  
that time we had the two fami
ly home in Queens and we 
had t enant s in t h e ups t airs  
apartm ent, a y oung couple with 
a little girl and we had as
ked them if they would find 
other place to live be
cause we wanted my 
mot her  t o hav e m or e comf ort  than we 
could pr ov ide in that, you k
now, in our apartment.  And pr
ivacy as well.  So after 
this couple moved, she had
 moved upstairs into t
he other apartment and our 
youngest s on m ov e d up wit h he
r to keep her co
mpany.  So he had
 a bedroom righ t  
next t o my mot her ' s and s o
 they kept each other com
pany and that wa s absolutely 
gr eat  f or bot h of t hem.  
They were sitting playing 
cards in the evenings and 
watching television together 
and it  was really  just a, a 
gr eat thing f o r bot h of them  
but especia lly for my mot
her who needed, who needed 
warmth, who needed some 
comfort because to have gone
 through what she has gone
 through and 
now losin g 
her sec ond hus band was  anot her horr ible ex
perience.  So it  wa
s great because you 
know, we had our m eals t oget h er and we 
were all c l os e t oget h er, but c a me t he 
ev ening, t h e t wo of t hem ret ir e d upstair
s  and t h ey,  you k now, it was r eally  
marvelous for both of them
.  But then when 
we moved to Rockland County, my 
mot her had gott e n s ic k.  She had c anc er 
of   the c o lon and s he s uff ered f or tw o 
year s.  I t o ok her t o t h e doct ors  t here and 
then they discovered 
that was cancer.  I 
did not  hes it at e f or a second, we went st
r a ight t o Sloan- Kette
ring, which is, you 
know, s p ec if ic ally for, t he best canc er 
c e nt er , you k now.   She had s ur ger y and sh e 
had suffered for tw
o years and she 
needed chemotherapy ever
y week, so I would 
tak e her t o  get t h e chem othe
rapy.  Then she w
ould have to go to
 t h e onc o logist  
every couple of weeks,
 or wh atever and th
en her surgeon, so it  
wa s a, one of those 
painf u l exper iences t h at last ed f o r two y e ars ,
 but I did everything
 that I had to and 
everything that they were ca
pable of doing for  her , I made s ur e that they t ak e c ar e  
of her and then two y ears lat er, in 1978, 
she pass ed away.  And t hat s am e wee k  
that s h e had pass ed away, bot h my s o ns  we
nt away to college. 
 So there were the 

two of us, t hr ee of t hem go
ne that same week
.  So it was a, 
little difficult.
 
Q: You were ____?
 
A: No, I was still in, in  New Ci
ty.  This was in '78 in June.
 
Q: All right, I thin k this is a good
 time to turn over the tape, 
this is the end of Tape 2, 
side A.
 
A: Well, this all took plac
e in June of 1978, my moth
er  pass ed on and while w e  
were sitting Shiva, which is
 a Jewish wa y of mourning 
when a person, close family  
member dies, that we observe seven da
ys of mourning ____________ the perso n  
and s o r ight after t h e s ev e n day s pass ed, bo
t h our s o ns went aw
ay to college.  So 

there we wer e, the t w o of us in 
a big house, rattlin
g.  But our...
 

Q: Rattling?
 
A: Ratt ling, in a big hous e, j ust t h e t wo 
of us, you know.  So 
then, my husband has 
a cousin here in Houston, 
wh o has been trying to get 
us to move down here for 
quit e a while but t her e was no 
r eason, but at this point at
 the sam e, ju
st about the 
same time, the company that my husband 
had worked for 22 years was sold.  And 
so a change had to be made 
and there were too many 
changes during that period 
of time.  So we deci
ded that we'll come down to look
 around in  Houston and see if 
there's anything really worthw hile to even talk  about i
t.  And we did c om e down an d 
within 48 hours decide
d to move down here.
 
Q: Did you come 
in the winter by
 any chance?
 
A: No, we came dow
n, I came, you know
 we came down in 
May and the weather 
was m a gnific ent and so we 
dec ided t h at s i nc e t he boys were in two diff er en t  
colleges, we had no idea aft e
r f our y e ars,  wher e t h ey  wi
ll wind up and 
we were in 
this big house in New York 
and my husband, you know, ju
st more or less lost his 
job after 22 years, so that wa
s a big, time for a big change.
 
Q: And your mother?
 
A: And my mother had just passed aw
ay so it was wee
ks, within weeks, 
tremendous, tremendous c
hange, so we made a decision 
that the boys should to to 
the colleges of their c hoic es 
at wher e they s i gn up and, 
but we put up 
the house for 
sale in Ne w City and then 
I came down to look
 around to find th
e house here and 
then my husband joined me to see if he 
agr e es and we mov e d down by Oct ober,  
end of  Oct o ber we we
re down here, this  wa
s from June to Oct
ober and it was a big 
change but we 
both started to work
 right away, and...
 
Q: What sorts of things...
 
A: Oh, what I left ou
t was that while we we
r e liv i ng in Queens  wher e t he b o y s, y ou 
know, in, they were in elem
entary school, I al
s o r et urned to sc hool dur in g the da y  
while they were in 
school.  I completely forgot about
 that.  While they were in 
school, I went to school an
d I bec am e an interior dec o
rator.  And so when we 
mov e d down t o Houst o n and I,  I was look in
g through the 
news paper to s e e if t here 
was any job opportuniti
es and I saw one, the first coupl
e weeks that I wa s here and 
applied for the job and I go
t it immediately and I stay
ed t h er e for six and a half  
year s.
 
Q: It's almost like it
 was meant to be.
 
A: Yeah I guess, I 
gues s.  So t h at' s  wher e I st ay ed
 for all that  time.  And then 
bus i ness st art ed t o, this is 
alr e ady  now in t he 80's and 
business was gettin g worse 
and you know, in Texa
s business was going down and 
so I decided to
 leav e t h er e 

and we opened up a second s t or e and so 
I was r unning one of t h e st or es and m y  
husband was running
 the second store.
 
Q: I don't think we heard wha
t, what kind of a store it...
 
A:  It's a liquor and wine s
hop and very nicely built 
with the wooden shelves and 
carpeted and you know, it 's...
 
Q: Did he have any special 
interest or any of his fa
mily ever have done anything 
like this before?
 
A: No, no, it's, I mean
, his f at her was a rat h er poor 
m a n, he had a large fam ily an d  
he did what ev er he had t o, t o
 make a,  y o u k now,  a liv i ng 
for the family .  So he did 
not have any kind of formal
 training and neither did hi
s children.  So when my 
husband survived, 
again he had to start from sc
rat c h and wor k  his way up t o  
what ever and t h ank G od I m ean, wit h all 
the work and wit hout t he f o rmal educ at i on,  
he still made a good living fo
r all of us and he was a
lways a tremendous father an d 
hus band and so we ar e marr ied now alm o st
 41 year s so I can j ust look back at  
thos e year s  as wonder ful and 
those few years that I had 
wit h m y mot her  as  be ing 
marvelous and I 'm very thankf
ul to her, helping me surviv
e t hos e horr ible, horr ible 
year s.  I c a n never be
 thankf ul enough t o her .  And I h
ope one day we'll 
meet again.  
And we ar e a ver y, v er y c losely k n it fam ily, 
the four of us , alt hou
gh one s o n liv es in 
New York and the ot her one 
liv es  down in Alabam a.  We
 c e lebr at e all our goo d  
days, birthdays, anniversaries. 
 In fact, for our 30th birthda
y, our boys 
made a very, 
very...
 
Q: Your 30th?
 
A: 30t h wedding anniv ers ar y, our son's m a de
 us a v er y, ver y big surpr is e birt hda y  
party wher e c l os e fr iends fr om
 y ears and y ears ago, t hey
 have come in from all 
over, to New York to cele brat
e our anniversary.   And if ei
ther one of us is  sick, th e 
boys ar e her e imm ediat ely and if
 it 's a birthday or a big bi
rthday or anything special 
or holiday s,  we tr y to be t oget h er as m u ch
 as we possibly can.  We are very, very 
close and I'm very thankful for that.
 
Q: Sinc e y ou under st and so what
 it's like to lose 
family,  I think it
 also gives you an 
understanding of what it's
 like to, to 
have family.
 
A: This is all that's im port ant in life now.
 
Q: Although you did mentio n one thing about
 sometimes being a 
little bit overly 
pr otect iv e.
 
A: True, that is true, I'm 
sur e we all ar e som e what ov
er pr otect iv e.  And s omet i mes  
they'll say so, Hey Ma, you kn
ow,  go easy  and don't  forget
 I 'm  now 30 or what ev er .  

But they don't really get upset
 about it, they just try to 
s ay  ease up a litt le bit Mom ,  
you know,  you're going a litt
le bit too far, you know, 
t o o worry ing,  y ou k n ow and 
then I lay off.
 
Q: For the 30th annive
rsar y, as f a r as all the friend s that  cam e, wer e, was t her e a 
cert ain num ber of them  who had 
also exper i enced t h e Holoc a ust ?
 
A: O h y e s, oh y es, a lot of t h es e...
 
Q: Could you talk about them?
 
A: A lot of these friends, yo
u know, who I mentioned, ther
e's one of them
 that lives 
in New York that we are st
ill very much in 
close touch with. 
 The other one in 
Colorado.  And there ar
e several of them th
at we have bee
n very close with and still 
are.  An d we talk to one 
another and if  one celebrates 
an anniversary we just call 
up and, or send t hem car d s or what ev er.  
That we do r e mem ber
 each other and the 
good times and t
he bad times, you know. 
 So t h es e ar e fr iends h ips  that ar e not just  
superfic ial, but very deep und
erstanding of one another 
and what our needs ar e of  
eac h ot her  and of life in 
gener a l.   And so, all thes e 
years we remember and we 
thin k about think you know about
 the life that we have 
gone through and trying to 
celebrate t h e good t hings.
 
Q: You mentioned so many g
ood things, family seems fo
remost and also making a 
good living, making
 a good home.  Ha
ving security.  As  
time passe
d and the 
awar enes s of t h e horr or of  t he Holoc a ust  bec a
me more real to the rest  of the world, 
did t hat  af fect  y o u and had y o u been 
aware that you were
 being a little bit 
secr et ive?
 
A: Well I didn't  feel that I was secr et ive,  be
c a us e I nev er kept  it a s e cret.   If any  tim e  
I spoke to anyone, not
 necessarily Jewish, not necessar ily people who have been 
in a c o nc entr at ion c a mp, but if we just 
had general talk s or 
discussions about all 
kinds of things and it  would come up 
through history, thro
ugh the t im e, what  
happened in this year or w
hat happened when that took 
place in the world and then 
I would say, "Well, I see it 
from it a different point of 
view because and these are the 
things how it  used to come 
up.  Not necessarily hiding it
 nor putting it
 on public 
view, per se.  
But if  the opportunity 
was such that it co
ntributed somethin g 
worthwhile that I felt, then I 
would mention it or talk about 
it or a phas e of it or yo u 
know, somethin
g lik e t hat.
 
Q: So y o u ment ioned when you 
first go to Americ a and yo
u were so horrified whe n  
the girl said , "That's enough of that Ho loca
ust," I guess I'm trying
 to say, it  sounds 
lik e, c orr ec t  me if I 'm wrong, t h at when y o
u, when y o u were in c o nv er sat i on wit h the 
way t h e world s a w t h e Holoc a
ust ver s us your  own exper i
enc e, and mov i es  too an d 

just news clips and t he way 
you s a w it  betr ay ed, ev en 
if it contr adict ed your  
experience, it didn't 
ev er m ak e you angr y?
 
A: Yes and many times I thin k about wh at it  
is really, why I did no
t talk about all of 
these things from the time 
that, you know, it was over? 
 Was it because of this one 
terr ible st at em ent  fr om  this lady,  I  was 
wondering many times. 
 T h at t h at was  s o  
painful that it  could have caus
ed me t o s i lence.   But t h en
 I listen  to ot her  people 
and, thousands of other people 
also did not talk ab
out it, because whether if it's wit h  
their c h ildren, t h ey tr y t o pr ev ent t he pain.
  Whether it 's with 
other people, because 
we felt that they really  
can't understand and 
not necessarily bec
ause they did not 
want to understand bu
t because I feel that 
to understand, to real
ly, fully understan d  
and empathiz e with what h
appened to us, throug
h us and through 
this  period, one 
had to really be in 
it, to fully understand it and whil
e we might have,  you k now,  just  
a conver s at i on and s o met im es  m ay b e ev en a 
little bit more serious conversation, a 
little bit deeper and going 
more into what happened.  Th
e understanding of anyone, 
Jew, non-Jew alike, could not 
be there unless you 
wer e t here.  T h er e is j us t  no way  
anybody can under
stand it.  Some people will try,
 some people will empathiz e, 
some people will read a trem
endous amount about wh at 
happened.  Some people 
will try to talk to as many
 survivors as to what happe
ned to you, to learn from 
different phases from differ
ent people because each of 
us, y o u k now, ther e mus t  
hav e been 12 diff er ent  countr ie
s or more t hat were invo
lved.  One may be Polan d  
and life was completely
 different there than 
it  was  in  Hu ng ar y.  Fr o m  Fr a nc e it  wa s  
not the s a me as in Denm ar
k and so t h e back gr ound of
 all these people are so 
entirely different.  The people from Poland
 or Russia might hav
e been, or certain 
parts, I'm not talk ing about 
t h e lar ger c it i es where t h er e was, you k now, trem endous  
education.  But you know, li
ke I described this
 older couple from the back woods of 
Russia, without any
 educatio n, so if yo
u put people together wi
th highly educatio n, 
educated people, let's say 
from Germany, thes
e are two complete
ly opposite ends 
of t h e, t h e wor ld.   And s o when y ou t a lk 
to one group of people 
fr om ther e, I  mean 
they lived in a little
 village without even 
a wood stove or
 whatever.  They did not 
learn, they did not know abo
ut what was going on this 
wor ld as did t he G erm an Jew 
or the Aust rian Jew 
or  the F r enc h J e w or t he Hu
ngarian Jew,  where there was 
much more educati
on.  So t hese ar e c o mpletely 
differ ent wor l ds ap art and so 
ev er ybody ' s going t o look at t h ings differ e nt ly
.  So  if you're going
 to talk  to a perso n 
from  this end of t h e s pectr
um and then you'll
 s peak t o  the ot her  one at t h e other 
end,  y o u' re going t o hear  
two completely different st
ories and life
s and so t o 
understand all of this, you hav
e to understand history and
 people who want to know 
about i
t, would want to
 read about it and would want to
 talk to a surviv or about it  
because that's where they'll 
get the, the actual facts, 
the truth, wh at had happened.
 

Q: In lieu of that, t her e wer e s o me pr et
t y fam ous doc um ent ar ies  done about th e 
Holocaust, I think in the 70's
.  Did y ou s e e t h os e, did yo
u remember the first time 
you ev er saw any doc u
mentar ies or footage fr om t hat  t im e?
 
A: Yes.  I remember  seeing
 the Holocaust, that was show
n on television, the film 
ser i es.
 
Q: T hat was in t h e 70' s?
 
A: Yes.  And that one was a 
disaster because it was prim
arily a show rather than 
the truth.  
 
Q: In a, wait a, by a s
how, tell me what you...
 
A: Just to, to basically almost like make
-believe.  You know like puttin g it  in the 
historic al background, but it 
is more like, like Dr. Zhivago,
 that kind of feeling, you 
know, t o show a lovely stor y.
  A litt le bit  mor e dr amat ic
 perhaps but t hat was not  th e 
way t o port ray  the Holoc a ust.   T h e one t o
 portr ay the Holoc aust ar e bas ic a lly t wo  
films,  as far as I'm co
ncer ned.  One is Shoa,   wh
ic h is a v ery long movie,
 
S- h- o-a
, 
which in the Hebrew means Holoca
ust and the other  one is St ev e n  
Spielber g' s,  the Sc hindler' s 
List.  And ev en and thos e ar
e not 100% near ly as quit e  
as bad as it really was, 
but they will give yo
u more of the true 
facts as to what 
happened. 
 
Q: Can I as k y o u how did y ou feel 
when you saw Schindler's List?
 
A: I was crying throughout and then a couple of
 week's later, or a few weeks la ter, it 
was available, you know, on 
rental.  I rented it  out again 
and I sat down
 by myself  
and watc hed it again and cr
ied thr oughout again.  And 
if I see it 10 t im es ,  the 
reaction will be the same.  
And I felt very much the sa
me way about the film Sho a  
and I highly recom m end people t o
 s ee t h at as well.  But 
above all I feel that the 
best way to tell people 
wh at happened, to 
teach people about th
e hatred, about 
what this whole thin g was 
about, wh at the Holo caust 
was all about is
 by teaching 
people.  And those of us w
ho survived, luckily well enou
gh so that we 
can teach or 
share our experiences 
and try to teach espe
cially the younger people what it was, 
what this whole thin g was really all about
 and what we  have 
to be wa rned against 
and what we can teach the 
young people, that 
they should never 
let this  happe n 
again.  And f or  that  r eas on,  s i nc e I  st art e
d to giv e  t hat  pr esent at i on f or t h e Yom  
Hashewah(ph) in 1979...
 
Q: T hat was in Houst o n?
 
A: No, that was still, 
that firs t one was st ill
 in New City in my...
 
Q: Just shortly be
fore you left?
 

A: J u st f ew months befor e I 
left and that star ted me on, 
on this tr ip on this jour ne y  
that I have been on and am
 I, I am on and hope God will
 help me to continue on, 
teaching students going to 
schools, from middle school
, high school, college, to 
libraries, t o  c iv i c or ganiz at i ons, t o chur c
hes, where I've been 
doing this now for, 
since 1980.  So it 's 16 year
s, non-stop, where I share my
 experiences, wh at I have 
gone through, what li
f e was lik e, what a beaut if ul li
fe we had 
before and how that 
came to a sudden
 halt by Hitler marc
hing into Hungary.  An
d what living in a 
conc entr at ion c am p wa
s like, what it  wa s 
like to live in a disp
laced person's camp 
for almost four years, not having freedom.  
T hen c om ing to t h e Unit ed Stat es, ho w 
diff ic ult it  was  t o get st art ed bec a us e I was  
still a scared child and 
then little by little 
to work all my problems out 
and find somebody 
that I had a lot in comm on with, to 
marry and have childre
n and start a new life
 and though I could ne
ver forget  what I 
have gone through, 
I still have to, and I had
 to and I still have to
 make a new life for 
ours elv es ,  for our sons and if when t h ey 
get  married, f or thei
r children.  And the 
only good thing that I feel 
I am doing is  trying to te
ach people about what happened 
and how we can and 
how we have to, lettin g some
thing like this 
happen to any 
human being any wher e  on 
the f ac e  of t he eart h.
 
Q:  Sounds like, you 
know we were talk
ing about, you showed
 me some of the 
things that you're going to
 show me a li
ttle later...
 
A: O ka y.
 
Q: ...about the copi
ng mechanism...
 
A: O ka y.
 
Q: ...the thesis and the book t
hat the woman 
is writing...
 
A: O k ay,  ther e is  one y oung lady  who got  in 
touch with me that she is wr it ing a book 
about how women coped in 
t h e c o nc entr at ion cam p s. 
 
Q: S p ec if ic a l ly _ __ ?
 
A: Specif ically women, how 
they were able and coping 
mec hanism s and what kept 
them alive and my experienc
e and I'm sure most of the 
other people will agree with 
me, that there was 
no one coping mechanism.  Th
ere was no way th
at you could 
decide that if you go 
in this row, rather th
an in that row, that
 you will be safer. 
Bec a us e the Naz i may  hav e de
c i ded t h at, at t he s pur of 
the moment, that that row 
is  going t o t he cr em at orium t o day and that 
row might go tomorrow 
or the day after. 
So ther e was no s uc h  a thing as  try ing, 
you know, making it 
or able to make the 
right dec is ion, ther e was no s u ch t h ing. 
 Survival in my op
inion was a chance.  
Chance of surviv al.  I mean how could I 
have said, told that when I was digging 
ditches, after, when the raw 
mat e rial in t h e f act or y ran ou
t and they took
 us out to 

dig ditches, foxholes
 f or t he G er m an arm y.   How would I have k nown t h at I  was  
barely able to pic k 
up t hat s h ov el, that t hat SS wa
s not going t o ge
t mad as all hell  
and blow my head open, you 
know.  So you coul
d never tell what
 will happen to 
you fr om one m om e nt  to the nex
t.   Ther ef ore it is str ict ly
 a chance survival.  Now as  
far as m y mot her helpi
ng m e and my ot her two gir lf r i
ends, I 'm sur e  th
ey had s i milar 
experiences, where my mother 
would try to tell me, when
 they come around, whe n  
the SS comes by, try to make sure you show
 that you are working 
and you're trying.  
That, yes, that helped me.  Her giving 
me the part of her bread without my 
knowledge, without a do
ubt that helped me 
bec a us e I  was  just a 14 y ear  old s k i nny 
little kid who was not 
used to this  kind of
 abuse and work and al
l of that.  So these 
things yes, these things helped.  But 
t her e was no c oping 
mechanism, maybe my 
friends hip wit h t hes e ot her  gi
rls was a little helpful, that  I had somebody to talk  to 
who was my age.  Perhaps all 
these little things
 added up, but I can't say that there 
was one thing, any time, an
ywhere during this whole 
period, t h at  there was  one 
thin g that helped me ot
her than t h es e t w o t h ings about my mother.
 
Q: I know, Maddie, it's 
a ver y diff icult s ubj ect ,  but and 
you've told me that to some 
extent, you religion has been
 therapeutic and I 
know that your fa
mily has been a 
ver y str o ng forc e in y o ur c ontinuing fait h.
  But ther e's been a lo
t of t a lk and t hing s  
wr itten about self-hatred over hav
ing survived at all.  Were
 you affected 
in this way?
 
A: T o s om e degree I was, be
cause if I think of my moth
er's, my father's birthday 
com i ng up,  if I t h ink of  my brot her 's, t h er e 
is n 't a t ime , in a l l t
hese years that I don't 
think of them on their birthday
s and I say, "Why ?"  My fa
ther  was a very, very good, 
charit able, kind person.
  My brot her was only  19, j ust t ur ned 20.  W hat k ind of ba d 
thing could he have done?  So
 I say, "Why was I better?
  Ho w was I better than 
either one of them?  So how
 come I'm entitled to live 
and t h ey wer e not ?"  And 
there is no answer, the same
 way there is no ans w er 
when y o u as k 
wher e was God 
all this t im e ?  And we all as k ed t h at, ever
y s i ngle one of  us.  And that' s the s a m e  
way, how c om e he let me s urv iv e and he di
dn't let my br ot her sur v iv e?  How was I  
any better than he was?  
So these are all question
s, good questi
ons, bad 
questions, these are just questions
.  There is no such thing again.
 
Q: How have you coped with these things, 
I mean have you, I'
ve even understood 
that ther e ar e ther apists t h at c a n't ,  c an'
t be helpf ul bec a us e as  you s a y, they 
haven't had the expe
r i enc e.  Hav e you ev er tr
ied to c omm unic ate wit h...
 
A: No, I have not 
tried for many, 
many years.  I don't know, 
it  wa sn't fashionable at 
that tim e.  See t o day, that' s
 much more, you know, going 
to see a shr i nk , that ' s the 

second best than going
 food shopping, you k
now.  So that wa s no
t  the c a se at  that  
tim e, it was n't  t he pr act ic e
, number one.  Number two, 
we would not ha
ve that kind 
of money to, you know
, to pay for it.  Number three, I'm not 
even sure...[pause]
 

Q: All right, we 're resuming 
here after a short telephone 
break and a co
ffee break. 
Very good coffee an
d very good fruit and 
what we began to 
talk about was the 
value of t h e Holoc a us t sur v iv
ors gr oup and your t eac hing. 
 And it seem s, it almos t  
seem s that  it 's a v a lue not j u st for  other s
, but  als o f or each ot her.  Could y o u t a lk  
about?
 
A: Well, let's see, when 
we st ar ted with t h is  gr oup
, you know, th
e Holocaust 
sur v iv or s, we got  toget her  for  t w o r e as on
s.  Number one wa s 
f or eac h other  and 
that we c an s h are som e of it  wit h ea
c h  ot her, t hose who surv iv ed it, who 
understand it, who, we can 
just look at one another and we know what the other 
one m eans , because t here is s u
ch communication that it 
does n't have t o be v e rbal 
and in t h is case, the 
Holoc aust s u rv iv ors pr ac tic a lly don
' t  hav e t o talk about  thing s  
to understand o
ne another.  So this  is
 a communication that 
is  definitely between 
just sur v iv ors.  And the ot her r eason t hat
 came up a little bi
t lat er,  because w e  
remembered when some of 
the people wh o were killed and
 they said, their last 
br eat h, r em em ber us, don't, no
t let us, do not le
t them forget us. 
 And bas ic a lly, I  
mean t h at' s  not, you k now, wor d for wor d, t h
at was basically what they kept asking 
before they went to their deat
hs.  Do not  let us,  do not  le
t them forget 
us.   So this  
was a promise that probably all 
of us t hat s urv ived m a de t o
 ourselves, that we will 
not let t he wor ld f or get them , bec aus e 
these we re all decent human beings an d 
they were just killed becaus
e they were Jews, or the ot
her six million who were not 
Jews, but for various not impo
rtant reasons, that 
t h ey wer e being killed as well.   So 
this was one of the ot
her things that we ha
ve promised, that we 
will not let 
the world 
forget wh at happened 
and what they did to them.  
And so, as the 
war ended, the 
other thing that besides tryi
ng to find our families and tr
ying to make a 
new life for 
ourselves, we also wa
nted to talk about the people th
at were killed and so when we 
start e d this  group, the Holocaus t  sur viv or
s, one of our  major 
reasons to getting 
toget her was to try to creat e some kind of
 a memorial to remember all these six 
million Jews that were murd
ered for no other reason th
at they, than they were 
Jews.  And in order to crea
te some sort of a memorial
, we had to gather on a 
regular basis and plan 
what ever we could aff o rd, what ev
er we  could do.  And that' s  
what happened here in Housto
n, when I, we moved down 
here the end of 1979 and 
we st art ed t h is gr oup in the 
beginning of 1980, in 
fact we were pla
nning on going to 
Israel for the world re
union of Holocaust su
rv iv or s and a gr oup of us  went and whe n  
we were all together
, you know, many thousands of 
people who were 
together in 
the c o nc ent r at ion c am ps  and we realiz ed 
that we can no longe
r postpone this an d 
we can not dilly dally with 
it, we have to sp
eak about what happen
ed and we hav e  
to educate people what
 happened, whether it's
 verbally or they can possibly do a 
building or a memorial or wh
atever, that will speak for a
ll these innocent people that 
were m u
r d er ed and one of th
e most important things t
hat we have decided on 
when we c am e back f r om I sr ael, from t h is  tr
ip, that we  are really
 going to put a very 

strong emphasis  in  buildin g 
s omet h ing her e in Houst on.
  And so I was among th e 
fir st ones, a sm all gr oup of us
 t h at st art ed r eally wor k i
ng o n it a n d wor k in g on it  
hard.  It t o ok us a long t im e
 becaus e it was, we ar e 
talk ing about very serious 
money.  But aft er all thes e y ear s ,  sinc e 
1980, ' 8 1, we f i nally
 opened this year on 
March the third, 1996.  And I 
have put in an awfu
l lot of t i me, eff ort,  ener gy, help in g 
build this.  Many, many h
undreds of hours in the mu
seum and taking wo rk home 
and I t h ink we hav e done j u
st ic e and I f eel t hat we ha
ve done a good
 job and we 
are telling the story the 
way it took place.  
In a simple way, but 
very straightforward 
and we are talkin g about 
everything that took pl
ace, people wh
o were the 
mur der er s,  we t a lk ed about t h e by st anders,  
who didn't lift a fing
er to help.  And 
we'r e als o talk ing about, in t h ere, about 
the people who helped, 
although very small 
in num b er, but ther e wer e those who helped 
and we have to defini
t e ly, I f e lt it wa s  
ver y im port ant that we
 ment ion t h at.  I n f act  right 
now we have an 
exhibit, about 
four people who were diplom at
s and t hey s av e d, I believ e it was ,  15, 000 liv es .  
Well, there's Wallenberg in 
Hungary and there wa s Sugiha
ra(ph) in from Japan an d 
there ar e f our of t hem that 
ar e being dis p lay e d r ight now,
 describing of wh at they 
did and how they did it and it
's fantastic.  So we just 
started that exhibit two weeks 
ago and t h is is  v ery  im port
ant because there we
re some kind peopl
e.  T h ere wer e 
some fantastic people 
in France, in the v
illage of Ch ambourd(
ph).  There were  
some magnif ic ent people wh o 
took Jews from 
Denmark and shuttl
ed it to Sweden.
 
Q: And this is the end of
 T ape 2, Side B.   
W e'r e going to Tape 3.
 
End of Tape 2.
 

 Tape3
 
Q:  No w we're talk ing about people who, who 
have helped, in al
l this horror and I 
want  to ask  Maddie( ph) if t h er e' s any o ne 
in your exper ience ever, who has helped?
 
A: Well, the only thing that 
I c an r e mem ber  t h at any b ody  
that ever did for me, as a 
kind ges t ur e from one huma
n being t o another, was when we
 were in the camp in 
_____________, this is 
a camp where we were workin
g in the manufacturing of 
ammunition and we woul
d mar c h c l os e t o an hour  t o t he f act or y from t h e, y ou 
know, where we were stayi
ng,  t hes e barracks  and the 
sam e  of  cour se,  coming  
back.  And one evening as we were walk in
g home from the f act
ory ,  it was already 
dark and I was walkin
g on t h e outside, bec a us e we we
re marching in rows of fives 
and I happen to 
be, at  this point  on t h e side of  
the sidewalk on the 
outside and as  
we wer e m arc hing, s o rt of dark, I  saw t h
is man passing by but
 I didn't pay much 
att ent ion, I was m uc h t oo hungr y and m uc h
 t oo t ir e d, I was j ust dr agging s om ehow 
to get back to the camp.  Bu
t I felt this man touching 
my hand, but my
 hands were 
so cold t hat  they wer e fr
ozen, I couldn't tell and then
 he, in German he says, "Take 
it already, take it."  An d so
 I took it, which tu
rn out to be a litt
le brown paper bag and 
I didn't dare to open it  up
 as were marching
, bec aus e if t he SS
 would see me open 
it, I would get kill
ed.  So when we went bac k to the,
 the camp, I told my mother that 
this  man that walk ed passed 
us handed me this  
little package so sh
e said that let's 
wait unt il we go back wher e 
we  go back wher e we c an 
be alone and 
so we would 
open it.  And that 's what we
 did and inside t h e pack a ge t her
e were two thin slices of 
br ead with j ust a lit t le mar
gar ine holding them toget h er an
d t hat was lik e a piec e o f  
gold, it was like 
a lif eline.  And s o  of c o urs e we s p
lit it and we at e 
it.  But that was 
the only kindness that I have
 seen throughout the Holo ca
ust.  And I'm sure ther e 
were other people who expe
rienced something good here 
or there but it was not 
the norm at  all.  
 
Q: Maybe lat er in t h e ca
m p, the displac e d per s
on's camp, there were?
 
A: Well, that was already different ball
game, once we were
 in the displaced 
pers on' s c a mp, y o u, t hat is not part of
 the Ho locaust any more, that is past the 
Holocaust and life was a comp
letely different ro
ut ine and diff erent lifest y le and as  I  
said we were free 
at t hat point t o  mor e or  less 
come and go as
 we wanted and 
although we were living in th
is awful barracks, you know
, wit hout any pr iv ac y ,  bu t  
that was, you know, that ha
d not hing t o do with t h e c o
nc entrat ion c am ps  any  mor e  
and the Ho locaust.  The Holoca
ust was during the time that
 some of us 
were in th e 
conc entr at ion c am ps ,  ot her ' s wer e m ur d er
ed in Auschwitz or 
other camps, those 
that were hiding out in, possib
ly in the forests 
and they were poss
ibly partisans and 
tried to s urv iv e t h at way, 
so this is the Holocaust.
 

Q: One of t he t h ings t hat I 
know you have talk ed about 
and I want  to hear y o u talk  
on tape, is your experi
ence at the national muse
um, the Holo caust and...
 
A: Well, the national, the mu
seum in Washington, I had 
been in vited to give oral 
testim ony back in
 1990 and I found that 
very rewa rding becaus
e when the opening 
took place and I went there 
and I've seen people'
s interest in there, it wa s very 
rewarding.  I also have a 
st at em ent in t h e v o ic es of 
Auschwitz in the museum in 
Washington and I didn't
 k now t h at was  ut il
ized in there until 
I went there to the 
opening and when I sat 
down to listen to the voic es
 of Auschwit z I heard my own 
and t h at was s ort of s h oc k i
ng as well.  An d that gave 
m e ev en mor e inc ent iv e to be 
involved in trying to build something here in Houston.  And so we did put in an awful 
lot of effort and I wa
s one of the people of 
a handful of us
 that worked on the core 
exhibit of this museum.  We
 have a marvelous gentleman
 by t he name of Prof ess o r  
John Rot h, who wr ot e the t e xt 
and there were four of us w
ho went ov er it wit h a f i ne 
tooth comb and added and subt
racted and did whatever we
 felt was necessary t o  
mak e it as authent ic, whic
h was the maj or word for us, 
as possible and I thin k we 
have done a pretty good jo
b.  We have thousands of peo
ple, adults as well as 
students from the surroundi
ng schools who are coming on 
very, very regular basis 
and t h ey ar e pr aising it  ver y 
highly, that it 's very inform
at ive and ver y  down t o eart h 
and it is , they think very hi
ghly of it  and I must say that
 I feel very good about the 
job we have done.  An
d to m e, what this repr es ents is  s om ething that we ar e givin g  
back , in ot her words we are k eeping those 
pr om is es  that  we ha
v e made r i ght aft er  
the war, when t hos e people wh
o were m ur d er ed and y e lled 
out in their last breath, 
"Don't let the world forget us."
  T h is is h ow I  fee l, t h at 
I hav e given ba
ck a litt le bit ,  
that I have kept my word to a
ll those people, 
that to teach the worl
d, to tell the world 
what happened and hoping that
 everyone who sees this 
museum and spends time 
there, will learn quite a bit about what 
happened and how they
 can think about it, 
that when som et h ing t err ible 
happens, how they could poss
ibly alter the course of 
that horrible thin
g that is happening and
 maybe to learn how they can stand up 
while so many others did no
t and those few who did, to
 lear n fr om t h em and if  
anything bad does hap
pen, that they will no
t let it happen, that they will speak up 
early, that it  cannot become 
so as bad as it was during
 the Ho locaust and the more 
we teac h t h em, the bet ter I feel about i
t.  And whenever we 
hear people who come 
and visit and they say that it  was very info
r m at iv e and very very 
good, it is like, I  
mean I just feel marvelous t
hat I was a small part of te
aching people about wh at did 
happen and how we can av
oid somethin g like this
 from happening again.
 
Q: Can you think of an instan
ce with a child, a moment when you were telling him a 
stor y or a r es p ons e that a 
person or a child ha
s had from your sp
eaking to them?
 
A: Yes.  There wer e seve
ral young childr e n who wer e 
about my  age, bec a us e I  
always make sure I tell them
 my age, how old I was when
 all this star
ted happenin g  

to m e and I  reac hed them v er y m u ch bec a
us e we ar e on t he s am e age lev e l and s o  
many, m any childr en c om e ov er and "May I 
hug you, m a y I touc h you?  I jus t  want 
to tell you how wonderful you'
re explaining all 
these things."  So
 all these things 
make you feel that perhaps I'm doing 
something or have done somethin g 
wort hwhile and at  t he end of  our,  the, t h e 
m u seum,  ther e is, lik e
 in the W as h ingt on 
museum, voic es of survivors 
and they have deci
ded to use a couple of things that I 
have said during my tape, vi
deot aping and so they 're us ing 
it her e and s o that is th e 
last part what, that one sees 
in the museum and expressing 
all of us, the surviv ors, 
who by the way are all 
people who live here in Houston.
  All, this whole museum is 
basically telling the story th
rough the surviv ors of the Ho
lo caust surviv
ors here in 
Houst on.   So ev eryt hing th
at y ou see t h er e,  you k now,  
you're going to see your 
friends, excuse me, 
telling about what happened
 here or there. 
 And some of the 
people that were the, you know
, in this  voic es is my voic
e and how I tell a couple of 
different things that happene
d to me, as did the other 
people and it 
seems to be 
quit e im pressive, people like it 
very much, so I feel
 this is a very 
good museum that 
we're able to build and
 I'm v ery pr oud of it and I f e
el sat i sf ied t h at I have don e  
som et h ing.
 
Q: You m ust hav e est ablis
hed lasting friendships wi
t h s om e  of these ot her  
sur v ivor s.
 
A: O h, y es,  most of us  are v ery, v ery c los
e.  In fact we hav e t wo f u nct i ons a y ear ,  
one of them is  a Hanukkah 
dinner dance, whic h took plac
e just two weeks ago and 
the ot her  one is  a spring lunc heon wher
e t h e childr e n of t h e s urv ivor s honor  th e 
parent s.  So we get t o gether
 on a very regular
 basis, formally  and
 informally and we 
have formed some very good relationships.
 
Q: Children of survivors is
 another subj ect, so I...
 
A: O h y e s.
 
Q: ...we will not get into
 that today, but...
 
A: Yeah, we have a group he
re also that had formed, ch
ildren of surviv ors who are 
second generation
 and they are quite active
 here in Houston also.
 
Q: Well t h at 's wonderf u l.
 
A: Yes, yes.
 
Q: I'm very interested.
 
A: Now, only, I'
m sorry, go ahead.
 

Q: W e ll I  j ust  want ed, at  s om e  point,  y o u'
ve told me off tape
, your feelings and 
response when yo
u f ir st went  into t h e m us eum in
 Washington and I just thought 
that was...
 
A: Ye s, I went to the openi
ng and I we nt with my older 
son and as we started to 
walk t hr o ugh and I was  mak i ng
, as I saw things and I wa
s making my comments to 
me son, it was j ust very, ve
ry painf ul and r e liv i ng s om e  
of that t hat I hav e s e en  
there wa s very, very painful. 
 When we  have reached the bo
xcar and it was time t o  
walk through it to get to th
e other s i de of  the m us e um, I 
couldn't make that first step  
to walk thr o ugh t he m u seum. 
 My son s u gges ted that we 
wa lk around it but I said, 
"No, ev ery body was able t o 
go get through the Holo caus
t and I have, I'm going to 
walk through that boxcar and 
remember all those people th
at we re carried in them 
to their deaths."  It was a very
, very painful journey
, but one that I felt that I had to 
make.  There wa s no way I 
couldn't, not have made it. 
 And I went back again an d 
spent about nine days there 
and her e, now that we hav e t he m us e um her e, o f  
cour se I s p end a lot of  time 
here bec aus e I put a lot of  
the work int o the, building 
the core exhibit and pl
anning it.  But of co
ur se, t a lking t o st udent s and v is it ors  alik e 
about all the things that we
 have in the museum and I 
hope that I'll be able to 
continue doing this and the 
r e as on I'm s ay i ng bec aus e at
 the moment, 
actually for 
awhile now,  I have not been 
well.  In Dec em b er of ' 9 1, 
I had cancer of a kidney and 
that was rem ov e d and f ort unat ely I 
didn't need chemot
herapy and I was 
recuperating well, so 
that's while I wa s able to put al
l t h es e y e ars int o this m u seum  
that we hav e built her e , but last June, in 
J u ne of 96, I c a me down wit h a c a nc er of  
the colo n and I wa s operated 
on that.  T h is t im e t he doc
tors decided 
to use some 
minor chemot her apy just t o play  it saf e
 and while I was on t h is chem ot her apy I  
developed a very bad pain in
 my back and the 
doctor told  me to
 go into the 
emergency room, where they di
scovered pneumonia in  that
 lung and a growth in 
the other.  Appears, af
ter several ser i ous check- ups and 
tests, they discovered that 
the colon, the r e nal c anc er
 or  the k idney  c anc er of  
1991 metastasized into th e 
lungs and so I'm not 
feeling so well right now bec
ause I am going th
rough a lot of  
chemotherapy, but 
if God is good an willin
g to keep me alive, 
I have promised t o  
continue my job of telling 
people about the Holo caust an
d I hope I'll be able to do 
that for whatev er t im e
 I ' m allowed. [pause]
 
Q: Now we ar e res um i ng.
 
A: Basically, right now, while 
I'm taking chemotherapy and
 doing a lot  of  rest s at  
home, I am trying to put t
ogether a family tr
ee, but basically st
arting with member s 
of my family that were murder
ed in the Holocaust.
  I n ot her wor ds,  start i ng wit h m y  
grandparents, who were the ol
dest members of my family 
t hat  was,  we
re killed in 
Auschwit z, their children, their grandchildre
n and all t h e way down 
to today, so that 
my children and perhap
s when they'll have 
children, will learn about
 the family that 

they had,  t hat ther e was a be
autiful life pr ior to the Holo
caust and to show them I'm 
try ing t o do it wit h pict ur es, whatever I 
c an,  wherev er I c an ge
t them.  From my on e 
and only aunt that came to 
the United States just before
 the war and pictures from 
her and making copies whatever I can 
get, anything and as
 many piec es of  
information I'm able to collect from the co
uple of s urv iving m em b er s of t h e family  
and it 's basic ally genealogy but I am not 
going  back very far be
cause right now I'm 
not well, but I want to
 do this for those of
 my, members of my fa
mily who were killed 
and even those few who 
survived and I would like this, to give this for my children,  
who did not know their aunts,
 uncles, grandparents or co
usins, so that they will 
know their family, at least 
through these pictures and 
whatever informatio n I can 
gather and wr it e down for them.  So  that
 is my preoccupati
on now,  since the 
museum is finished.  I feel 
th is is  ver y im p or t
ant to give to my 
children, to leave 
some sort of a legacy of 
their family. [pause] __________
__, okay.  Wait  a second, 
it had to happen 
before that because I'm trying 
to do them chr
onologically but I 
thin k this has been ch
anged ____, this is my
 father and this is 
my family.  See this 
is that Re d Cr oss letter that 
I said that, the inqui
ry.  So that's the 
copy and those are 
the original letters.
 
Q: This letter from your father, 
would it  be in 
another language?
 
A: Th at 's wr itt e n in Hu n ga r ia n, ye s.  
 
Q: Would it be difficul
t to read some part?
 
A: Well they could be enlarg
ed and it will be much easier 
because his writ
ing is like 
little pearls, you know, so itshouldn't be so diffic ult.  Th
is  is  m y br ot h er.  O kay and 
this was our rabbi,  this wa
s our synagogue be
fore the war.
 
Q: In the village?
 
A: In our city, not the village
, but a city and this
 is what they ma
de out of it, you 
know, when the Rus s i an occ u pat ion was t h er e,
 they changed the whole thin g, they 
made it look like nothing.  So
 t h is  is b as i c a lly  my h om e, 
but it was ruined.  This had 
a beautiful balcony and it had 
a center entrance 
and it just, I don'
t know, they just 
ruined it.  And thes
e are some of the sc
hools that I we nt to.
 
Q: So y o u went  bac k ?
 
A: We went back.  I didn't 
ever even mention that.  You 
see in 1990 the four of us 
went  bac k, bec aus e...
 
Q: Who was that?
 
A: My hus b and,  our  t w
o sons and I.  We went
 back for the first 
time and the reason 
we did was,  I really didn'
t want to because I knew that
 it was going to be very 

painful but when I 
spoke to the students and I stand 
in front of them and tell them 
about all these things, they 
alwa ys say, you know, it 's 
marvelous that we do this , 
you k now,  thos e f e w of us  wh
o can bec a us e it 's  that,  t hey
 say that it 's one thin g 
when you learn about it in a book and it 's  
somethin g else when 
somebody stands in 
front of you who was ther
e and lived through
 this.  And so 
with that in mind I felt  that 
when t hey opened up the Rus s i an sect ion,  
you k now,  and they finally let s om e  
outs iders go int o t h e Sov i et Un
ion in that area.   So I dec
ided that it  would be time 
to go back there and 
see t h ings and for t h
e boys to, ou
r sons t o see wher e w e  
come from and see 
whatever they could.  So 
we went back to my husband's 
homet o wn and t here was n 't one Jew t hat 
s urv ived.  And t h er e was not hing ther e 
that belonged to the Jews.  
Then we we nt back to my 
hometown and we found m y  
house as you s a w, but in 
horrible shape.  An d then
 from there we went to 
A us ch w it z.  A nd th is is  in 
Au schwitz, these pictures are 
all in Auschwitz and these, 
this  is  the urn, when you wa
lk into the, into the Ausc
hwitz museum, this holds the 
ashes of millions, of thousands
 of people here.  
This is one a pedestal and that's a 
big ur n and that has som e as hes from t h
os e that wer e  bur ned to deat h t here in 
Auschwit z.  An d so we went back to 
Auschwitz, which was 
a horrib le, horrible 
experience.  Ne vertheless that
 too had to be d
one.  Perhaps if no
thing else, just 
healing for my husband 
and myself, you know.  And thes
e are some of 
the pictures 
that my friends gave me also
 for my 15th birt
hday, just before 
the war was over. 
Wher e they  got t h es e penc ils and papers 
I don't know, because 
where, t h e s ect io n 
of the factory where I worked
, I couldn't get any of thes
e things, but apparently  a 
couple of them did.  And they are showin g 
here the pictures, lined
 up, of five rows 
of fives marching to the factory and back. 
 And t h en her e ar e pict ur es of aft e r the 
war of my mother and myself. 
 And some of them
 are terrible.  An
d then of course 
the displaces person's camp 
where, this is the hospit al
 where m y mot her wor ked 
and t h is  is.. .
 
Q: Is she in this picture?
 
A: Ye s, s he  is in t h e p i ctur
e right here.  I'm sorry, here 
she is, oh, okay.  And the n  
this is t h e sc hool where I was lear ning
 how to sew and thes
e ar e s ome of the 
dresses that we have 
made and this is taking a test  
and I was congratu
lation that I 
passed the test
 on that one.
 
Q: Who was tak i ng t hese pic t ur es ?
 
A: Again by that time ther
e were some people wh o were
 able, you know, had some 
money and were able to buy a 
camera.  So this must ha
ve been mayb
e the brother 
of my girlfriend, yo
u know, taking those pictures.  
And thes e ar e pict ur es where I  
was learning how to 
become a dental
 technician and this 
was the teacher right  
here.   And then t h es e we
re s om e  of t h e fr iends t h at I '
v e  made ther e.  And one o f  
thes e, the one in the middle here is one of
 the girls that I wa s together in the 

conc entr at ion c am p with or igi
nally  and then we 
m et again in t he di
splaced person's 
cam p.   And this is, let 's s e e, s um m ert im e and wint ert im e, y ou k now, the s e as ons,  
when you are there four years, you know, yo u go through all the 
different seasons. 
And ther e's  my m other  wit h a 
fr iend at t he hospit a l and t h is
 is a girlfrie
nd that I was 
so c los e wit h, t his is, s he got m arr ied in 
t he displaces per son's ca
m p  and t h is is her  
wedding.  And I guess that was 
a m a id of honor t h at I was in
 t her e.  And t h is  is th e 
Br em erhav en c am p where we wer e held for 
a week or so before
 putting on the, 
being put on the s h ip t o c ome t o t he United
 St ates.  And then th
is is a v ery s ho r t  
period after  we hav e arr iv e d to t he Un
it ed St ates, my  mother and my self.  A nd 
here's my mother and my
self and two little cousins and 
this is some of
 their family.
 
Q: Is that you?
 
A: That's me, yeah.
 
Q: You lo oked very happy.
 
A: Oh of course, of
 course.  It was just
 a couple of weeks after we have arrive d 
here.  And this is a c o py 
of m y bec om i ng a cit i z en.  
 Of course, you know, you ha d 
to...
 
Q: Your maiden name is?
 
A: Fisher.  Mm-hm.  An
d then t h is is 
already lat er on 
when I  was a li
tt le bit more 
rela xed and have gone through
 the worst of you know, so
cializin g and work and all 
of t hat , s o t h is was alr eady
 in the 50' s, ear l y 50' s.
 
Q: Who is t hat gor g eous gir l ?
 
A: That was me.  O n ce up
on a time I had a 
good shape.  But ev en that  has  
changed.  And this is here
 with  my 
husband-to-be.
 
Q: On the beach.
 
A: Yes.  And this is our 
engagement party and then our 
wedding.  This  is on our 
honeymoon in Florid a.  An d 
then this is  one of the 
ceremonies, you know the 
Jewish ceremonies when 
a boy is  a week old 
and they trim the 
penis, then as a 
celebration it 's called a 
br is.  So this is that par t ic ular
 part y , whic h is 
one of t he m ost  
im portant  c e lebr at ions in a Jewis
h boys life.  And this is a ce
rt if icate of that that took 
place.
 
Q: Okay, we're going to go
 to another subj
ect and something we spoke about on 
our break was your husb
and's feeling about speaki
ng about his experience.
 
A: Well he has much more diff
iculty with speaking
, as a matt er of f a ct whenever I'v e  
tried t o go ov er it  a litt le 
bit, you know, just se
e if he could brin g it  out, but we hav e  

tried many times, but 
apparently  he's 
hav i ng a ver y t o ugh t im e shar ing or gett i ng i n  
touc h wit h  thes e f eelings.  M a ybe m y 
healing mechanism is  talk ing about it 
although it is very, ve
ry painful every time I talk about 
it because I relive this every 
single time.  But perhaps this 
is my way of coping.  He ha
s a diffic ulty talk ing about 
it.  He is able to, if we ha
ve a conver sation wi
th friends and we re
ac h a point in the 
conv er s at ion where it, we ar e t a lk ing abou
t, pertaining somethin g to the Holo caust, 
he is able to do that.  But so far he
 wa s unable to sit 
down and s h ar e his  
experiences.  But 
hopefully, if I get we ll
 soon enough, we're go
ing to try it again,  
bec aus e I t h ink it is ver y, v er y im port ant  th
at we s h ar e our exper i
ences, f or one thin,  
to discredit the people who ar
e claiming that there wa s 
no Ho locaust and also for 
thos e people who c om e aft er us  
and I'm  afr a id t her e is  too 
little written about it in 
sc hool books where t h e c h ildren c an lear n abo
ut it and s o what ev er  way t h at t he y  
can learn about this most ho
rrible  happening of the 20th ce
ntury, I think it  is ver y  
im portant that they learn.
 
Q: And is n't it also 
for your own healing?
 
A: W e ll t h is  is wh at I s a id, f or m e pe rh a p
s it is a f orm of  hea
ling and m ay be that' s  
one of the reasons why I am 
and have been doing it  all th
es e year s,  but  I' d  lik e  to 
think m or e that I 'm contr i but in
g even in a little way.  A 
litt le shar e in t e ac hing th e 
people what happened and making 
sure that it is not forgot
ten.  And this  is the way 
I pr efer looking at it.
 
Q: Is t h ere anyt hing,  out of  all the t h ings 
t h at we' v e c o ver e d, t h
at you want t o go 
ov er again, or t hat  y o
u would lik e t o add t o ?
 
A: Well, I don't know, I haven'
t thought about all these thin
gs for quite so
me t ime s o  
it 's difficult to pinpoint just
 exactly one thin g or another 
that I, I see I would like t o  
repeat but I think the most 
im portant thing that I see fo
r m ys e lf  is to co nt inu e 
educating people because the 
sign that I had suggeste
d for our museum at the 
entrance and it was ac cept ed
 by the people that I wa
s working with, was from 
Pr im o Levee(ph), wh ere he says, "It hap
pened, ther ef ore it c a n happ e n again. "  
And I feel that this is so ve
ry true and I feel that we ha
ve to repeat it
 and repeat it  
countless times, to teach 
people what happened and tryi
ng to teach them to stand 
up and speak up when t h ey 
hear or see som et h ing te
rrible happening to any 
human being at all.  An
d s i nc e t h at  s ign is in f r ont of  
my eyes all the ti
me, that it can 
happen again, then my personal 
wish is, that as 
long as I can speak and as long as 
I'm we ll enough to do
 it, I would like to contin ue te
aching people and telling people 
what happened and I'm hopi
ng that they ar
e learning from it  so 
that if  they do se e 
something said or done to 
a hum an being t h at s h ould no
t be done, that this time 
there will not be so 
many bystanders, but 
instead, rescuers.  An
d I hope I will help 
or I am helping t o ac c om plis h t his.
 

Q: Thank you so much.
 
A: You'r e v ery welc om e.
 
Q: God bless.
 
A: It's not a very good job 
but, you know, can't alwa ys be ve
ry good right?  Some of  
our days ar e bett er t han other s.
