We begin with this photograph of
 
Leon Merr ic k  who was  born Leon Kus mirek on J anuary
 
8, 
1926, in Zgier z, Poland.
 
 
After the Nazis  attacked Poland in Septem ber
 
1939, Zgier z J ews  wer e m oved to Lodz, 
Poland.  The arrow on this  map of Poland points to Lodz.
 
 
The Lodz ghetto was  form ed in Febr
uar y
 
1940.  Over 100,000 J ews  wer e forc ed into les s  than 
two s quar e m iles  of neglec ted neighborhoods  in the norther n end of the c ity.  In the ghetto, Leon 
worked for the pos tal s ervic e delivering letter s, milk, and ration c ards.  This  photo s hows  m ember s o
f 
the ghetto Pos tal Ser vic e.  Leon is in the thir d row, s ec ond from the left.
 
 
One of Lodz' main s treets  pas s ed through the ghetto and was  kept open for non
-
J ewis h 
c om m er c e s o the J ews who lived in the ghetto had to c ross  that s tr eet on br idges  like this  o

In 1944, Leon was  taken to a forc ed labor c am p in Kielc e, Poland.  Fr om there he was  
evac uated to the Buc henwald c onc entration c amp.  The ar row on this  m ap of major  Nazi c amps  in 
Europe points to Buc henwald.
 
 
Three m onths later, Leon was  s ent to the Flos s enburg conc entration c amp.  This  arr ow on the 
m ap points  to Floss enburg.  Fr om there he was  sent on a Death Mar c h.  Leon was  liber ated by the U.S. 
forc es in Apr il
 
1945.
 
 
We c los e our s lide pr es entation with this photo of Leon pos ing with fr iends s oon a
fter 
liberation.  Leon is  on the far right.
 
 
After the war , Leon wor k ed for  the U.S. Ar my in Germany befor e c om ing to the United States  
in 1949.With the $23 that he rec eived upon ar rival, he m ade a new life here in Was hington, D.C.  He 

was  dr afted into the U.S. Ar m y dur ing the Korean War. Eventually, Leon opened his  own res taur ant 

that he ran for a quar ter  century. Given its  c los enes s  to theWhite Hous e, it was  a popular plac e 
es pec ially with the Sec r et Ser vic e, who gave him  a party when he r etir ed.
 
 
S inc e
 
his  r etirement in 1993, Leon and his wife, Nina, have remained in the Was hington ar ea.  
Leon is  a volunteer with the Mus eum 's  Vis itor Servic es .  You will find him her e ever y other Satur day.  

He is  als o active with the J ewis h War  Veterans.  In 2011, Leon was  one of five s ur vivors  liber ated by 
the U.S. Ar m y asked to lay a m em or ial wreath at theWor ldWar II Mem or ial on the D.C. Mall.
 
 
Nina, who fought with the partis ans  inWorldWar II, c ontinues to wor k  as a Hebr ew teac her.
 
 
Leon and Nina los t one of their two daughters, Mira, at age 27, due to a rare liver  dis order  
twenty
-
s even years  ago.  Mir a was  an artis t. Their daughter  Mars ha is  an MSW s oc ial wor ker  and the 
m other  of Leon and Nina's  two grandc hildr en. Their  gr anddaughter Mellis a is  a graduate of Dr exel
 
University in Philadelphia with a degree in c omputer s c ienc e and engineering.  While in c ollege she 
taught Englis h in India. Their  gr ands on J os h lives  in Is rael but is  working in Rus s ia at the moment.
 

With that I would like you to join me in welc om ing our
 
First Per s on, Leon Merr ick.

>> 
Bill Bens on:  Leon, thank  you ver y m uc h for your willingnes s  to be our firs t pers on today.  It's a 
tr em endous  pleas ur e to have you here with us .  Thank  you.
 
>> 
Leon Merr ick:  Nic e to be her e.  Thank  you.
 
>> 
B ill 
Bens on:  Leon, you have s o m uc h to s hare with us .  We'll get s tarted r ight away.
 
>> 
Leon Merr ick:  Ok .
 
>> 
Bill Bens on:  You wer e not quite 14 years  old when the Ger mans invaded Poland in 
September
 
1939 and c am e into your  town.  Let's begin with you telling
 
us  about your  c omm unity, your 
family, and about your s elf in the time leading up to the s tar t of the war  and the Germ an invas ion of 

Poland and your town.
 
>> 
Leon Merr ick:  It was  a Fr iday, 1939.  My mother  jus t cam e back  from  the market.  We s aw Germ an 
planes  going back and forth.  At that time we thought, you know
 
--
 
I was  s uppos ed to go to s c hool.  The 
Germ ans c ame in.  After  eight days  they c am e in to our hometown and we c ouldn't go back  to s c hool.  

My father lost his job.  He c ouldn't go back to work.  Everything was  getting s c arc e, food, this and this .  

The Germ ans  were going fr om
 
hous es to houses.  People had to go into the hous es , the s ilver  c andle 
s ticks  and all of this s tuff.  It was  very bad. 
 
>> 
Bill Bens on:  Before we c ontinue about what happened when the Germ ans  c am e, take us  back  a 
little bit and tell us a little bit about your  family. What was
 
--
 
you s aid your  father  los t his  job.  What was 
his  oc c upation?  What did your  mother do? 
 
>> 
Leon Mer rick: Well, I was  born 11
 
kilometers fr om the 
c ity of Lodz.  My  town was  a factor y.  We 
pr oduc ed c loth and all of this  s tuff.  My father  was  employed in a textile m ill.  He was  getting orders  

fr om  differ ent bus ines s  people.  And they finis hed the cloth and dis tributed to different s hops.
 
 
When the Ger
m ans c ame in, m y father was  only one of two J ews  wor king with his  c om pany.  
He los t his job.  He c ouldn't go back.  A lot of German, folks Germ an.  You know what I'm  talking 
about?
 
>> 
Bill Bens on:  I do, but you might want to explain that to the audienc e.
 

3 
 
>> 
Leon Mer rick:  He was  bor n in Poland, like I was  born in Poland.  He was  a Polish c itizen but his  
bac k gr ound was fr om  Ger many.  His  anc estors  cam e from  Ger many.  So when the Germ ans c ame in, 
all of a s udden I s ee people who work with m y father and all of a s udden they had the Nazi s was tik as .  
 
At that tim e they had long lines  for br ead.  A guy took  me in the fr ont of the line at that tim e.  Didn't 

m ake a differenc e fr om the very beginning.  Later he pr obably c ouldn't do that.  This  was  a Polis h 
Germ an.  And the
 
Bu
rg
omei
s ter
, the mayor, becam e
 
--
 
als o a Germ an, Ger man folks, Germ an.  They 
r un the c ity. 
 
>> 
Bill Benson:  Do you rem em ber  the Ger man Army marc hing into Zgierz?
 
>> 
Leon Merr ick:  Yeah.  I was  outs ide.  I was  watc hing them going towards  Wars aw.  I was  14 year s  
old.  They didn't bother m e yet. Wars aw, you know. 
 
 
Ok.  So when the war  started and they s tarted bombing the c ity, people from the c ity, they 
went to the c ountr ys ide.  We went to the c ountrys ide.  My mother  and my br other, my s is ter , we went to 
the c ountrys ide.  We s lept on the ground.  We were afraid for the bum s  to be in the hous e.  But at night, 
you know, the Pols  let out the people fr om the prison.  They cam e at night.  They were bothering us .  
You c ould s ee 
fr om 
the shaved heads  they had gone to pr is on.
 
 
And then it was  going around, all able
-
bodied men who wer e in the Polis h Arm y had to go 
bac k  towar ds Wars aw.  Som e wer e ther e.  My father left, too.  I, my m other, my younger brother  
dec ided to go back  home.  
 
 
So we c am e back  home.  Our neighbors wer e glad to s ee us .  All of a s udden we hear d 
s hooting.  One of the neighbor s  s aid the Ger mans  ar e c oming into the c ity.  So we went to the bunker , 

the c ellar.  
When it was  all over , we c am e out and s ee Germans outs ide, differ ent uniforms  and all of 
this stuff.
 

>> 
Bill Benson:  If you'll bear with m e for  a m inute, I'm  going to fix your m ic rophone.  It's r ubbing. 
 
>> 
Leon Merr ick:  Ok .
 
>> 
Bill Bens on:  I'm going to
 
just move it over  here.  Bear with m e for a m inute.  I think that will do the 
tr ick.  Ther e we go. 
 
 
You m entioned the folks Germans.  All of a s udden they appear ed wear ing the s was tikas. 
 
>> 
Leon Merr ick:  Yeah.
 
>> 
Bill Bens on:  After a tim e they began pointing out who were J ews  in the town.  Right?  Bec aus e they 
knew, they had lived there with you.
 
>> 
Leon Merr ick:  They k new it.  They went to the differ ent bus ines s es .  They op
en
ed bus ines s es  and 
they took  whatever  they want to, c lothes, textiles , all kinds  of stuff.  So my father  c ouldn't go back  to 
wor k.
  
And then no s chool for J ewis h c hildr en.  I c ouldn't go back  to s c hool over ther e.  I stayed home. 
 
 
Then a r um or  was  going on, all J ews  have to as semble to the main m arket square.  So we 
were debating with m y fam ily, going to the market square, ar e we going to take c lothes  with us, ar e 

they going to let us c om e back or  not, or  s hould we just go, thr ee of us, my br other, mother , and my 
father, and leave m y younger brother  with m y neighbor s . We dec ided t
o go as  a fam ily.  We didn't take 
anything with us. We went to the m ark et squar e
. T
he c obble stones  were warm .  It was  the beginning 
of 
Septem ber.  After s itting ther e 
--
 
we wer e s urrounded by Germ an guards .  And after  s itting maybe an 
hour  or s o, a German c ame out, s tood in the pedes tal and s aid this plac e is  to be fr ee of J ews  in three 
days .  He would give us  three days .
 
>> 
Bill Bens on:  Meaning the whole town.
 
>> 
Leon Mer rick:  The whole town.  And the whole town was  28,000 people, 4,500 J ews .  Ok?  So 
we 
went hom e.  My m other pac ked up s om e c lothes. We c ouldn't take any utens ils  or furniture or things 

like this .  We c alled in our  Polis h neighbors.  And we s aid
 
--
 
this  was  in early Septem ber .  England and 
Fr ance dec lar ed war, Germ any.  You think of two 
big power s
; t
he war 's  not going to las t long.  So my 
m other  pack ed up s om e clothes . We hir ed our neighbor
™s  
hor s e and wagon, put all the c lothes  on the 
w
agon. We went to the
 
c ity of Lodz, 11
 
kilometers  away.  J us t put s om e bedding, c lothes and things  
lik
e this .  We c ame to Lodz.  We m oved in with my aunt, with m y m other's  s is ter.  They had a fam ily  of 
four.  We s lept on the floor.
 

4 
 
>> 
Bill Bens on:  So when you went to Lodz, you gave your fur nis hings  to a Polis h neighbor  bec aus e 
you thought this would be te
mporary.
 
>> 
Leon Merr ick:  Temporarily.  Like 
I 
m entioned, England and Fr anc e dec lar ed war , Germany, two big 
powers . With all of that s tuff, not going to last long.  Never  went back. We had br and new fur niture.  
My unc le des igned furniture. We never  saw
 
the furnitur e again.
 
 
Any way
 
--
 
>> 
Bill Benson:  Did you go to Lodz bec aus e you had family ther e?
 
>> 
Leon Merr ick:  Yeah.  My m other 's s is ter
 
--
 
at one tim e we wer e debating, s hould we go to the city of 
Wars aw or to the c ity of Lodz.  We went to the c ity of Lodz, m oved in with my aunt.  From  the beginning 

we s lept on the floor .
  
Then they organized.  They es tablis hed c omm unity kitchens .  So we went to eat 
in the c omm unity kitc hens, es pec ially Pas s over, a day like that.
 
 
And then we hear d they would form a ghetto in the c ity of Lodz, a ghetto.
 
>> 
Bill Benson:  This was  probably the s pr ing of
 
--
 
>> 
Leon Merr ick:  Ear ly s pring.  One of the leaders  fr om the ghetto
 
--
 
I don't know, you probably hear d 
the nam e befor e.  My father  us ed to work  with his br other
 i
n 
the s am e fac tor y
 i
n Zgierz before the war .
 
So he went to him looking for help.  He s aid, well 
--
 
he bec ame the 
d
ir ec tor of one of the hos pitals.  
They had s even hos pitals  in the c ity of Lodz, in the ghetto.
 
>> 
Bill Benson:  In the ghetto?
 
>> 
Leon Merr ick: 
 
In the ghetto its elf.  So he gave him  a job as an order ly.  This  was  very good becaus e 
food was  getting scar c e.  So if you have a job, you got an extr a bowl of up s o in the kitc hen.
  
Then m y 
Mom 
Œ 
m y 
father talked to the head nur s e and s he gave her  a job 
in the orphanage
 i
n the ghetto.
 
>> 
Bill Benson:  In the ghetto.
 
>> 
Leon Merr ick:  So that's how it is .  So we wer e in the ghetto until 1944.
 
>> 
Bill Benson:  Tell us about the ghetto.  How big was  the ghetto?
 
>> 
Leon Merr ick:  It was  two s quar e m iles .  Two
 
s quare miles .  People had no jobs .  They were milling 
ar ound on the s treet.  They had c ommunity kitc hens .  You had to go with the coupons .  You would get 

your  ration of br ead for the week.  Som e lady with a bowl of s oup from the c omm unity kitc hen, tak e to
 
her  fam ily after  s he us ed up her  tickets.  All of a sudden a boy jumped her, knocked her down, s pilled 
the s oup.  Nothing to tak e hom e to the family.  At the s ame tim e, he s preads  out and licks up the soup 
fr om  the s idewalk.  Hungr y.
 
>> 
Bill Bens on:  At fir st there were over 100,000 J ews in the ghetto at first.  Right?
 
>> 
Leon Merr ick: Well, over  100,000.  Ok?  Then it built up to 150,000.  Then the Germ ans  started 
br inging the J ews  all over  Eur ope fr om  Fr anc e, from  Germany, and packed them into the Lodz 
ghetto.  
So ac c ommodations  had becom e ver y s c ar c e, food had bec om e ver y s c arc e.  Like I s aid, they would 

dis tr ibute a loaf of bread for your  ration.  Som ebody knock  you in the head, took the br ead away.  He 
was  eating while he was  r unning.  What are you go
ing to do? 
 
>> 
Bill Bens on:  That was  danger ous but you also told m e that the hous es on the outer edge of the 
ghetto, that were next to the fenc e, that was  also danger ous .  Say a little about that. 
 
>> 
Leon Merr ick:  Ver y dangerous  bec aus e
 
it had the bar be
d-
wir e around.  They would s hoot to kill with 
r ifles .  
A 
lot of smuggling was  going on.  I didn't, but we knew they us ed to
 
--
 
s om e people were 
s m uggling between news paper s  acr os s the wall.  Somebody grabbed.  If it was  a Germ an news paper , 

at leas t you knew what was  going on.
 
 
Sometimes a guard was trigger happy.  He c alled a guy or  a boy or a m an to c om e out to the 
fenc e. 
 
He c am e here.  He picked his  hat, blew it.  The boy went r unning.  He s hot him in the back . 
 
>> 
Bill Bens on:  You told me they would take potshots  into the hous es. 
 
>> 
Leon Mer rick:  Yeah.  People
 
--
 
you would hav e the lights  on at night.  But es pec ially near  the fenc e 
over  there, you put the light on and the guard was  tr igger happy, s hot. 
 
>> 
Bill Bens on:  As a result, people began to s eal off the back  of their  hous es .
 
>> 
Leon Mer rick:  Yes.  They s ealed the front door s .
 
>> 
Bill Bens on:  Bec ause that was  facing the fenc e.
 
>> 
Leon Mer rick:  Fac ing the fenc e.  Som ehow they would go thr ough the bac k .
 

5 
 
>> 
Bill Bens on:  J obs  were really impor tant, as  you s aid.  Your father wor k ed in the hos pital.  Your  
worked in the or phanage.  You landed a job in the pos t
 
offic e.  Tell us two things :  one, how you got 
that job but I was  am azed when you told m e there was  a functioni
ng pos t offic e s
o tell us  abou
t that.
 
>> 
Leon Merr ick:  It was  a functioning pos t offic e bec aus e when the Germans  invaded Poland
. 
Poland 
was  divided at that time.  Half of the Germans
 
--
 
later the Ger m ans  invited
 
--
 
a lot went to the Soviet 
s ide.  I s ay Soviet.  The Soviet side.  In the m eantim e, they 
s ent packages to the fam ily, s ent m oney 
and things  like
 
this .  So it was  a pos t offic e, a
 
r unning post offic e.
  
 
 
I™d
 
s een young boys  m y age, 14, 15, going with s atc hels , a c ap on.  I asked m y father, 
ﬁW
hy 
c an't I have a job like this?
ﬂ
  
H
e says , 
ﬁW
ell, let's  see what I c an do.
ﬂ
  
So he talked to the head nurs e.  
And the head nur se took  c ar e of the m en, the pres ident of the ghetto.  He was  a bac helor at the time.  
The Germ ans  m ade s ur e he had c lean clothes  and ever ything.  She talked to him .
  
All of a s udden I 
was  c alled to the s ec retar y, to the pers onnel office.  And I c ould s ee a big R, initial.  I know I'm  going to 
get the job.  She asked
, ﬁH
ow old ar e you?
ﬂ
  
I s aid 
ﬁ
14,
ﬂ 
14
 
1/2 at that tim e.  She s ays , "How ar e you
r 
legs?," I s ays , "Ok."  "Can you run?"  "Ok ."  They gave me a job in the post offic e.  So I got an extra 

bowl of s oup.  Ver y im por tant.  An extr a bowl of soup.  And I met boys  m y age.  Ver y im portant.
 
>> 
Bill Benson: What about your s iblings ?  Did they find work?
 
>> 
Leon Merr ick:  I had one brother.  He was  too young to have a job.
 
>> 
Bill Benson:  So he r elied on you.
 
>> 
Leon Merr ick:  The rations .  And we had extra s oup s o we c ould s har e with him, t
oo.
 
>> 
Bill Benson:  As you m entioned, after a while the
 
Germ ans began br inging in J ews  from  els ewhere.  
You told me they at one point brought in gyps ies .
 
>> 
Leon Merr ick:  Yeah.  Well, gyps ies , yeah
 
--
 
Aus tr ian gyps ies .  One day they dec r eased the ghetto 
with a few s tr eets .  They put the gypsies  s eparately.  I
 
was  told they would pack  in the gyps ies  with the
 
Jews b
ut the head of the J ews , I don't k now, he talked to the Germ ans  and s ays, well, you know, the 
gyps ies
 
--
 
s o they had s eparated them .  They didn't las t long.  We hear d s hots  ever y day, every day.  
One 
day the big truck s  pulled up and took them all to the c onc entr ation c amp, the extermination c am p, 
to the fir s t exterm ination c am p outs ide the c ity of Lodz.
 
>> 
Bill Bens on:  For the J ews , when did depor tations  begin?
 
>> 
Leon Merr ick:  The deportations  started beginning of
 
--
 
the end of 1941.  And in 1942, the Germ ans  
m ade a c urfew.  Nobody could go in, out fr om the hous e.  And they would go from s tr eet to str eet, br ing 
the J ews  down the street.  And the look on their  fac es .  The s elec tion.  Ok?  The s elec tion.  This was  
1942.  At that time they took  out 16,000 people and c hildren, put them  on truck s , s ent them to the 
exter mination c am p outs ide Lodz, the first exterm ination c am p.
 
 
Rum or s wer e going around older people they would take to the crematorium and you
nger to 
the s c hools.  They took  them  all to the exterm ination c amp, gas s ed them all.
 
>> 
Bill Bens on:
  
Your father worked at the
 
hos pital.
 
>> 
Leon Merr ick:  Yeah.
 
>> 
Bill Bens on:  At one point the Germ ans  c ame into the hos pital.  Tell us  about that.
 
>> 
Leon
 
Merr ick:  One mor ning m y
 
--
 
m y father worked the night s hift.  He c ame hom e and s aid the 
Germ ans c ame throughout the hos pital and took  out all the patients .  There wer e five hos pitals  in the 

ghetto its elf.  Surr ounded all the hos pitals , took  all the patients  out. We knew they s ent them to the 
exter mination c am p outs ide Lodz.  Forgot the name of it. 
 
>> 
Bill Bens on:  Chelm
n
o? 
 
>> 
Leon Mer rick:  Yeah.
 
>> 
Bill Bens on:  Did your father los e his  job in the hos pital after that?
 
>> 
Leon Mer rick:  Yeah.  They took  the patients , and that's it.  So the J ews  made a s maller hos pital.  
He got a job over  ther e but not on the s ame s ize.  It was n't the s ame.  They took  the patients  away.
 
>> 
Bill Bens on:  One of the things  you told m e, Leon, with food being s o shor t s o dif
ficult to get, that in 
the ghetto ther e were fr iendly doctor s  who would give a pr es c ription for potato peels .
 
>> 
Leon Mer rick:  That's right.  People were hungry.  If you know a friendly
 
--
 
they had c omm unity 
kitchens .  Ok?  So they had people peeling pota
toes .  The m ain meal, potatoes .  Soup was  the m ain 

6 
 
m eal.  J ust bread.  You got a loaf of br ead for the beginning for  one week .  
I
t had to las t for  10 days .  
The main diet was  s oup, potato s oup.  So if s omebody gets s ick , you
 
ha
d a friendly doc tor , you went
 
to 
him , he would give you pr es c ription for potato peels .  So people knew already whic h s oup, where to 
peel the potatoes  thick.  So they went over there.  Got a pound of potatoes.  Was h them up, the peels , 
ther e's  nothing left.  It was  the best you c ould d
o.
 
>> 
Bill Benson:  As you explained to us a few minutes  ago, Leon, you wer e at the post offic e and 
deliver ing mail.  At s om e point your  r ole at the pos t offic e c hanged after the deportations began.  Tell us  

how your r ole at the pos t offic e c hanged.  You started deliver ing things other  than packages  and 
par c els .
 
>> 
Leon Merr ick:  Yeah, from  the beginning, that's  right.  Deliver ed notic es  to a c er tain s pot to an 
as s embly point.  They were s uppos ed to go to work in Germ any and s aid
 
--
 
s o I had to deliver  this
.  It 
was  wintertim e, es pec ially.
  
I had a notic e for a guy
 
--
 
they c all up c er tain nam es  and you c ome to the 
building.  I call up.  I hear a faint voic e from  behind the c urtain.  You k now?  I make my way thr ough it.  

Cur tain was a blanket.  The wooden door was  already c hopped up for wood a long tim e ago.  Now they 
had a blanket hanging ther e.  The blank et was  full of ic ic les .  I would make my way in there.  I hear d his  
voic e.  I c ould s ee the ice c r acking over there.  I go inside.  What do you think it is ?
  
They're all laying in 
the bed.  They have no jobs , no food.  They'r e jus t laying in the bed all day long.  And I had no good 
news .  No.  Not good news .
 
>> 
Bill Benson:  Their  mail is  a notic e to r epor t.
 
>> 
Leon Merr ick:  Finally  m y
 
c urtain c am e, too.
 
>> 
Bill Benson:  Four  year s  in the Lodz ghetto before you were taken.  Your time c am e, as you s aid.  
Tell us about the c ir c umstanc e that led you being taken out of the ghetto and where you were taken 

from there.
 

>> 
Leon Merr ick:  So c ons tantly they wer e taking people.  Like I s aid, we didn't know where they were 
taking them, m aybe for  work, Ger mans.  I got a notic e.  1944, Marc h 10, I get a notic e to r epor t to a 

c er tain plac e, an as s em bly point, to work  in Germany.  Ok ?  So 1944.  At that tim e the Soviets  m ade
 
the offens ive from Stalingrad and all of thos e things.  We thought maybe we wer e going to be liberated 
by the Rus s ians . 
 
So I was  hiding for a few days .  I didn't want to report.  People must have talked to 
m y family.  They s aid:  L
is ten, the boy's  only 17.  At the tim e I was  17 years  old.  Maybe they will take 
him  for work to Germ any.
 
 
So my mother packed up a s weater.  We had no food but we had c lothes.  Pac ked up a 
s weater, extr a pants , under wear, war m s ocks.  Marc hed through cold in Poland and Germ any.
  
I went 
with 
m y father to an as s embly point in the ghetto its elf.  At that point they s tart to fatten us  up
, g
hetto 
people.  Gave us extra bowl of s oup.  You're going to wor k  for Germ any.  You got to be healthy.
 
 
Finally Marc h 10, they mar c hed us out of the ghetto.  The first tim e I was  free outs ide the 
ghetto.  I wasn't free. 
 

>> 
Bill Bens on:  The r es t of your  family
 
--
 
>> 
Leon Merr ick:  My fam ily was  ther e
:  
father, mother, younger br other
.  
I was  the only one.  I
 
was  17.  
I was  able
-
bodied to work  for  Germ any, for the Germ an war effort.  Ok? 
 
 
So we boar ded the c attle c ar s.  After r iding for two or three hours , c attle c ar s tuffed, the 
Germ ans were alr eady waiting and they took us  a plac e in Poland.  I don't know if you hear d, Kielc e, it's 

c alled.  This  place was  k nown
 
--
 
they had a Pogrom after  the war.  Pols  made a Pogrom this time.  
They took  us over  ther e.
 
 
So they had alr eady establis hed a J ewis h war  cam p. We got off the tr ains .  Says  what about 
m y c lothes ?  It's  go to follow later .  I never s een anything.  I was  lined up.  Whatever  I had on m y bac k.  
They took  us to the c amp.  It was  a Jewis h wor k  c amp.
 
>> 
Bill Bens on:  The few belongings  you had
 
--
 
>> 
Leon Mer rick:  I never s een it.  The next day they m ar c hed
 
us  
to the fa
ctory.  I 
c ame in c ontact with 
non
-
J ews .  I had a s weater.  Took  off the s weater .  I gave him the s weater .  He gave me a loaf of 
br ead.  I had nothing to tr ade.

The s am e guy
 
--
 
at this  point I don't know who took  the c lothes, either the Germans took  it or 
the J ews  who r un the c amp.  I don't know.  But when we c ame to Buc henwald this  partic ular J ewish 
guy who was  the head of the c amp, he cam e to us , people fr om Lodz, from the ghetto.  He s ays , "If 
they ask about m e, I was  good to you guys ."  And I was thinking about my c lothes .  But I didn't dar e.  
They would kill
 
--
 
I didn't s ee him later anyway.  Maybe s om ebody was n't this  nic e.  So m aybe he 
didn't
 
--
 
m aybe the Germans  took  it.  I don't k now.  Or maybe they took  it to their wives , they c ould 
b
ar ter for whis key, for  butter , for who knows  for what.  I never s een it anyway.
 
>> 
Bill Benson: When you wer e in Kielc e, what wer e you doing there
, w
hat kind of work?
 
>> 
Leon Merr ick:  I was  making bullets.  So every mor ning they m arc hed us  under guard to
 
the factory.  
There we c am e together with non
-
J ews .  We work ed alongs ide.  So we know what was  going on on the 
outs ide.  If I had s omething to trade, like I jus t mentioned, a watc h or s omething, a s weater, the guy 
would bring m e a loaf of br ead.  The non
-
J ews  went to their  hom es.
 
>> 
Bill Benson:  This was  r egular wor k  for  them.
 
>> 
Leon Merr ick:  Regular  wor k  for them . We had to go back  to the barr ac ks.  In the morning, the 
guar ds  ar e waiting for us.  We c am e out.  They c ounted how m any people.  They m arc h
ed us  to the 

c am p.
 
>> 
Bill Benson:  So you would s tay there for I think  s everal months.
 
>> 
Leon Merr ick:  As a matter of fac t, when I was  in the Kielc e, in fir st c am p, I hear d about the 
Nor mandy invas ion.
 
>> 
Bill Benson:  You did?
 
>> 
Leon Merr ick:  Yeah, yeah.  We heard it r ight ther e, the Norm andy invas ion.
 
>> 
Bill Benson:  And by that tim e did know
 
--
 
did you know what was  happening to J ews  els ewher e, 
that they wer e being exter minated?
 
>> 
Leon Merr ick: We knew.  By that tim e we knew it alr eady.  We worked with non
-
J ews .  They know it 
bec aus e the c onductors  who run the train, the m ac hines , they knew exac tly where they were taking the 

people.  They wer e taking the people into Treblinka.  Nobody ever c om es  out fr om  ther e.  We k new 
what was  going on. 
 
>> 
B il
l Bens on:  In the s um m er  of
 
--
 
you went to Kielc e Mar c h 1944.  In the s umm er of 1944, you wer e 
taken to s everal other s lave labor c am ps befor e you ended up at Buc henwald.
 
>> 
Leon Merr ick:  Sum mer  1944, after  the Norm andy invasion arr ived.  Guards  c ame, pac
k  up, 
whatever  you had.  Whatever  you had left.  Maybe I acquir ed another pair of pants , I don't know.  They 

took us to the tr ain, put us  on the tr ain.  Open c attle c ar s.  Ok?  You're riding m aybe four, five hours .  
Train stops. We get off the car.  In th
e open fields .  
 
 
The next day it was  a Germ an labor organization.  They m ade us  dig ditc hes  for the 
advanc ing Soviet arm ies.  How long you c an dig ditc hes ?  You asked the guards  what's going to 

happen when this  job is  finis hed.  They shrugged
 
their should
er s.  Ask  the guy 
why c an't you take bac k  
to the Lodz ghetto, jus t a few hour s by train
.
  
J us t c ame fr om there, s till Poland.  They told us the ghetto 
was  being liquidated now.  
 

 
That was  the end of fall, late s umm er of 1944.  And my parents were s till ther e, my br other 
was  there.  I never  heard fr om them.  I'm the only s urvivor  from my family.  Not only this , I don't even 

have a pic tur e of m y family.  I would give anything just to have a pic ture.  You know?  I'm m arr ied now.  
My wife, s he never  m et
 
--
 
s he
 
does n't know what the in
-
laws  looked like.  I never  had have a pic ture, 
s ingle pic tur e. 
 
>> 
Bill Bens on:  After you wer e forc ed to do
 
--
 
dig the antitank  ditc hes , then where did you go fr om 
ther e? 
 
>> 
Leon Mer rick:  They took  us  back to a plac e in Poland.
  
They had the sam e fac tor ies  that they had in 
the previous  c amp.  While we wer e digging the ditc hes  for antitank  ditc hes, they transfer red the 
m ac hiner y from the fir s t fac tory to the next.  So we did the sam e kind
 
--
 
>> 
Bill Bens on:  They just m oved the f
actor ies.
 
>> 
Leon Mer rick:  Yeah.  And we had the s lave labor er s.  This  didn't last long.  One date guards  c ame, 
pac k  ever ything up.  Going on the double, on the double.  They m ar c hed us  to the tr ain station.  I don't 

8 
 
know if I mentioned the name.  Anyway.
  
So on the double.  We went in the tr ain.  This  tim e it was  
c attle c ars, locked c attle c ar s . We didn't know wher e they were taking us.  Bar bed
-
wir e.  We c ould 
r ead German nam es but we didn't know wher e we were going.
 
>> 
Bill Benson:  But you knew you were in Germ any now.
 
>> 
Leon Merr ick:  Yeah.  But in the meantim e you c ould hear c hildr en going fr om s c hool, giggling 
outs ide.  We c ould hear whis tles  blowing, people with the breadbask et for lunc h her e and ther e.  We 
were loc ked in c attle c ars  for  the only reas on becaus e I'm a J ew, just lock ed up.  
 
 
And after riding for  s even, eight days , ok?  The train s topped.  The tr ain stopped.  Opened the 
door s .  Oh, the s un hit us  in the eyes .  It was  pitch black ins ide.  It took  a
 
s ign that s ays  "Conc entration 
C
am p Buc henwald."  We wer e in Ger m any.  I c ould s ee the Nazi flags , the s was tika, the flag flying 
ar ound.  Maybe two, three m inutes  the guards  c ame up.  Line up a c olumn of five.  Ok?  So we lined up 

a c olum n of five.  At that tim e I had pic tures of m y family in my pockets.  I had letter s , addr es s es from  
r elatives . We didn't k now the extent, what happened to the J ews  in o
ther  c ountries.  Thought m aybe 
we had r elatives  in Holland, Belgium.  But the Ger m ans went over  ther e, too.  From  Paris .  We didn't 
know.  We 
thought m aybe we would m eet after the war.
 
>> 
Bill Benson:  You still had the address es  of relatives .
 
>> 
Leon Merr ick:  Everything.  A big hallway, m aybe twic e as  long as this one.  Had a long table.  
Ever ybody undres s .  I undr es s ed, put it on the table.  I stood all naked.  All of a s udden a big German 
guy, a black uniform
 
--
 
this  is  an SS guar d
 
--
 
stands  in front of m e and points  to my legs.  I m entioned 
before they took  my c lothes  away
 t
hey m ade us  work in the fac tor ies .  They didn't give us  any aprons . 
 
The oil s pilled on m y pants  and everything.  They were blis ter ed.  Es pec ially in J anuar y, c old over  
ther e. 
 
>> 
Bill Benson:  That was  fr om the oil that s eeped thr ough your pants.
 
>> 
Leon Merr ick:  From the oil,
 
yeah.  He points to m y legs .  I don't know, in the best Germ an, I don't 
know if he under stood me or not.  I told him  the stor y that I worked in the fac tory, they didn't give us  any 
apr ons .  Sunday I was  able to was h my pants  with c old water  but it didn't do any good.  I had the 
blis ters .  I explained to him .  He just s tood ther e for  a s ec ond.  Shook his  head.  And walked away.  
Ok?  Walked away.
 
>> 
Bill Bens on:  He otherwis e c ould have s ent you
 
--
 
>> 
Leon Merr ick:  Yeah, well, he c ould s ay anyway
 
--
 
if he would have a s elec tion, he would put m e 
with 
the people he s elec ted.  Ther e was  no s elec tion day.  I just had the blis ters.  Guy probably didn't 
know what to do.  I was s till young in the fac e.  I jus t had the blis ters .  At that tim e I was  going on 18 

year s  old.  So he just s hook  his  head and walked 
away.
 
 
Fr om ther e they mar c hed us  in to the next r oom.  Ther e wer e pris oners jus t like I was  but they 
ar r ived befor e.  They c ut our  hair, underneath, under the arm s, ever ywhere.  After the hair c utting was  

over , they led us into another room.  We had to submerge in water , green water.  Look ed like infec tion 
water .  It was  bur ning my blis ter s.  But it only took  s ec onds . When I stood up, I notic ed the next door , 
the door was  ajar.  I notic ed the s hower heads.  And at that tim e we heard the s tory about the sho
wer  
heads .  They tell you to take a s hower but instead of water , gas  is c oming out.  They c ouldn't prove it 
but the stor y was  going ar ound.  I'm  nak ed.  There was  no us e.  So I go fr om this  to the next room.  
Water not r unning yet.  The whole r oom , a big hallway jus t like this  one.  All s hower heads . Water 
does n't run yet.  I'm  standing under neath the s hower
, s
hower head.  Then another  guy c omes  in.  And 
a thir d guy, under the s am e s hower  head.  Everyone wants  a good s pot when the water  starts  r unning 

bec a
us e everyone is  burning.
 
>> 
Bill Bens on:  Fr om  the dis infec tant.
 
>> 
Leon Mer rick:  From the dis infec tant.  Maybe other guys  had blis ters, too.  Who knows ?  Maybe they 
had s omething els e.  Any way, finally water star ts  r unning.  Ahh
, 
s o we're happy.  We are 
alive for the 
tim e being.  Water is  r unning.
 
 
After this job was  finis hed
 
--
 
after this  was  finis hed, I go to the next guy.  He had a pad and 
pencil, asked m e m y nam e and where I c am e fr om , what tr ansport.  He writes  it all down.  Let me go 

into the next room.  He gives  m e a jacket.  Not one of the pajam a jack ets like her e.  J ust a plain jacket.  

9 
 
Maybe s om ebody from  before who died.  J acket
, pants , n
o underpants , no s hir t, nothing.  I go to the 
thir d guy.  He has  s ome c logs underneath his arm.  I c ould s ee fr om far  away they'r e not the s am e s ize.  
One is longer , s horter.  I s aid
, ﬁT
hey'r e not going to fit.
ﬂ
  
He s aid "I s ay they fit.  Next!"  
 
 
So I just go over  ther e.  Jus t take the c logs .  Put them under neath 
my arm.  At that time they 
let us  outs ide.  They
 
let us outside.  It started s nowing already.  We wer e jus t under  the s ho
wer s , 
s hiver ing over ther e.  Next, a guy c omes in
, ﬁF
orwar d m ar c h
.  F
ollow me.
ﬂ
  
So m ar c hed over there.  
They let us  in in a bar rack
, th
is  one naked light bulk.  You c ould s ee the bunk  beds .  You s it down.  At 
that point he s ays
:  
I need three guys  to go to the m ain kitc hen and bring soup for your people, you 
tr ans ports who just c om e in.  You had nothing to eat for s even days .  A c ouple of guys  volunteered.  

They went.  They c om e bac k .
  
They gave m e a bowl of s oup.  Gave me a new bowl, s poon.  
 
 
This  was  the lifeline.  You had no bowl, you had no s poon, you die.  Ok?  They gave m e this.  
They gave me a bowl of s oup.  They gave m e a piec e of br ead.  I eat the soup up.  I keep the br ead f
or 
the evening.  I put in m y poc ket.  In the evening, I put m y hands down, the bread is  gone.  Somebody 
s wiped it.  [Laughter ] 
 
So s omebody s wiped it.  Ok? 
 
 
So I was  in this  bunk  over  there.  Only took  m e one time out for work, to c ar ry wood.  The 
followi
ng day I s tayed in the bar rack s .  You c ouldn't s leep.  Whistleblows.  You could not lay.  You had 
to get out of there.  I stayed ther e.  A guy c om es to m e.  He said
 
--
 
ok , ever y barr ack  had a r oom and 
had barr ack or der lies  living in the room .  They c ame before us .  They m ade s ur e the barrack  was  c lean, 
no fights.  He c om es to m e and s ays , "You want to c lean our  r oom ?  I'll give you a piec e of bread."  
ﬁ
Yeah.
ﬂ
  
Tickled pink.  So I c leaned the room.  After I'm finis hed, he gives  m e a piec e of bread
.  B
efo
r e I
 
walk out 
I ask ed him, "Can I c om e back  tomor row?"  My m ind is  wor king.  He s ays  yes .  So the next 
day when I got up, I s tayed near the door.  I figured if the guy c om es in, blows  the whis tle, everybody 
out, you c ouldn't be in the barr acks.  Ever ybody out.
  
As sem ble outs ide.  I s aid
, ﬁ
I cam e to work .
ﬂ
  
That's what I did. 
  
So I would go in.  Gave me a piec e of bread. 
 
 
One day when the guy com es , s am e guy
 
--
 
m aybe after a week  or two weeks he s ays , 
ﬁY
ou 
know, ther e's  a c ottage.  Ther e's a c ottage behind the
 
barracks.  Maybe they need s om eone to c lean 
the r oom.  Why don't you go over there.  Maybe they can us e you.
ﬂ  
So I go over ther e, outs ide the 
bar racks.  All Germ ans .  They wer e Germ an pris oners .
 
>> 
Bill Bens on:  Ger man pr is oners?
 
>> 
Leon Merr ick:  Germ an
 
pr is oners .  But onc e a dis c us s ion who was  better, Ger m an pr is oner  better  
than a J ewis h pris oner?  Of c ours e, Ger m an pris oner .  Maybe one of the guar ds
 
--
 
who knows ?  Ok .
 
 
So I go in over  there.  I explained to him the bar r ac ks, need s om e help, need s omebo
dy to 
c lean.  He s aid, "Do you have lic e?"  Pr obably.  I s hrugged my s houlders.  I wouldn't s ay.  He s aid
, 

ﬁC
lean yours elf up and com e back .
ﬂ  
So I go into the m ain barr acks .  I go, c lean m ys elf up.  I was  
working ther e, cleaning the r oom.  It was  not c old
 
over  ther e.  It was  warm  ins ide.  
 
 
At this point I under stood Germ an already.  I don't know if they were Communis t, 
c ons c ientious  
objec tives , J ehovah's Witnes s es, but one of them had a red triangle on the pants .  They 
were dr es s ed to kill.  Tr iangle righ
t her e.  They r eceived pac kages  from hom e.  He s ays , 
ﬁ
Leon,
ﬂ  
he 
says, ﬁ
you have good
 
[indis c er nible]
 
--
 
give me s om e cr acker s .  Yeah.
 
 
Then, ok .  
This  lasted maybe a m onth or s o.
  
I was  going ever y day.  I hear d them talking.  
They wanted to join the German Ar my.  Said this  late they'r e going to s end to the Rus s ian front.
 
>> 
Bill Bens on:  He was  a Germ an pris oner.
 
>> 
Leon Mer rick:  But he had a c hoic e.  Maybe he was  a J ehovah™s  Witness.  They don't believe in 
s hooting or bear ing arm s.  If he agr ees to this  they c ould let him go and he joined the Arm y, goes  to the 

Rus s ian fr ont, gets  killed.  They know what's  going on.  He didn't want to do that. 
 
 
So, ok .  Then one day they announc ed ever ybody, all the J ews , ass em ble in the m ain plac e.  
There was  a s election.  I didn't want to ass emble.  If they tr ansfer, they kill you.  So the next day they 

s aid ever ybody as s em ble, going to evac uate the c amp.  Ok? 
 
 
So they kept us in a bombed out factory a day or  s o.  It was  the evening till they let us out.  
They had guar d
s with whips .  They were beating us.  As s em bled in a c olum n of five.  Marc hed to the 

c ity nearby, nearby Buc henwald.  It's  a major  c ity.  Anyway

Bill Bens on:  A c ouple of ques tions befor e you go on.  You had m entioned ear lier  when you were 
forc ed to 
strip off all your c lothes, you had had the addr ess es , the envelopes  and pictures, and you had 
to put them on the table.  That was  the last you s aw of thos e.  Right? 
 
>> 
Leon Mer rick:  Yeah.  I put the whole jacket.  Put everything on the table.  I didn't 
s ee anything.  
That's the last I s een it.
 
 
But I r emem ber

m y mother's s ister.  She was  liv ing in Paris .  I r em embered Paris

I 
r em em bered 10 and then the one I r em em ber ed.  I know they had a beauty s hop bec aus e they used to 

s end perfumes  from Paris , 1936.  So I knew they were in the beauty s hop bus ines s .  They s ent a 
pic ture outs ide, the white c lothes.  I know
 
they were in bus ines s.  So I didn™t
 
know the extent of what 
the Germans did.
 
 
Als o, after liberation I found a J ewis h Nazi hunter.  She was  a Ge

a Nazi hunter .  Ok?  
Found s om e m inis ter, Frenc h minis ter, s he found a lis t of the tr ansfers of people fr om  Par is  or other

I didn't find her hus band.  But I found her name bec aus e s he was  bor n in 
Poland and things like this  s o I k new it was  her. 
 
 
After the war  I went back  to Par is .  Ther e was  a Jewis h
 
--
 
his  name
 
--
 
at that time I m ade a 
c opy of the lis t of m y aunts .  I
 
go in.  I s ays
, ﬁYou 
s peak Englis h
?ﬂ
  
He s ays , 
ﬁN
o.
ﬂ
  
ﬁ
Speak  Yiddis h?
ﬂ
  
Points  out to a 
propr ietor
.  I tell him the story.  I had an aunt.  I k now s he went to Aus c hwitz.  But what 
happened to the r est of her  fam ily?  He s ays
, ﬁ S
it down
.  
I'm going to find
 
out.
ﬂ 
 
So he m ade a c ouple of phone c alls .  He cam e bac k  and s ays
, ﬁT
om orr ow's  going to be a lady 
with pic tur es .  Come over  her e tomor row.
ﬂ
  
I s aid, "Who is  the lady?"  Why 
c an™t
 
s he c ome today?
ﬂ
  
Cannot c ome today, c ome tom orrow.  So I have no c hoic e.
 

 
So the next day, after finis hing the after noon, 3:00, I went back  to the plac e.  The J ewis h 
neighbor hood in Par is.  I s ee a lady.  At the s am e time s he c ome towar ds  me.  I go towar ds  her .  We 
intr oduc e.  I s aid
, ﬁW
ho ar e you?
ﬂ
  
She s ays  that her  brother  was  m arr ied to my aunt.  So s he tells  m e 
her  br other was  mar ried to m y aunt.  I s aid
, ﬁ H
ow did you s ur vive?
ﬂ
  
She said the Germ ans were in 
Paris , too.  But at that tim e s he s ays  I was  19, 20 year s  old and Frenc h gendarm es r ounded up the 
Jews.  
And one s aid t
o the other one, ﬁYo
u're not going to tak e her  to the c am p.  Get lost.
ﬂ
  
So s he got 
lost.  
 
 
So s he tells  me they took  m y aunt, m y unc le, took  them  to the c onc entration c am p.  My 
c ous in, too.  But s ur vived the war.  He c am e back  after the war.  She s aid he
 
was  skin and bones , 
nur s ed him  back  to health.  He's mar ried.  He left a daughter but he died of c anc er about 10 years  ago.  
I was  too late.  She s ays
, ﬁI
'm going to give you the addr es s and you c an call his  daughter up.
ﬂ
  
I did the 
s am e thing.  I c alled 
the daughter up.  She c om e to s ee us.  She had an album of pictur es.  Ok?  She 
br ought the album.  I found m y gr andm other's  picture ther e, my uncle's , my aunts .  But I c ouldn't find 
m y parents . 
 
 
Europe, you had to go to a photogr apher .  You had to have m oney.  It was n't eas y like today 
with pic tur es .  Maybe they c ouldn't affor d to have a photograph. 
 
When I was  s till at hom e, I heard them  
talking m y aunt was  s uppos ed to c om e from  Par is  for  a vis it.  Then the war broke out and they never 
did it.  So I figur
ed you had to go to a photogr apher .  My father worked in a factory at that tim e, my 
m other  didn't work.  May be they c ouldn't affor d their pic tur e.

Bill Bens on:  So
 
to this  day
 
--
 
>> 
Leon Merr ick:  To this day I don't have a picture.  Whatever  is  in m y memory, that's what I have.
 
>> 
Bill Bens on:  So you wer e for c ed out of Buc henwald on a
 
for c ed marc h to We
i
m ar .  Tell us about the 
death m ar c h you were on.
 
>> 
Leon Merr ick: We wer e back  fr om  the c am p.  I think it was  a Sunday.  I don't know.  People were 
go
ing to c hur c h.  They put us in an open cattle c ar.
 
>> 
B ill B ens on:  This is  wintertim e.  Right?
 
>> 
Leon Merr ick:  Yeah.  Spring alr eady.  In c attle c ar s.  I befr iended s omebody, a guy from Poland.  
He was  m y age.  I didn't know him  befor e.  We mor e or les s
 
s tuck  together.  So her e we s tay in the 
c attle c ar.  Ok ?  Fr om Flos s enburg, Buc henwald to Flos s enburg.  Fr om Flos s enburg, we s tay over  

11
 
 
ther e.  And all of a s udden, jus t c am e over head.  Swooped down.  Shot up the whole train.  Everybody.  
Something hit me
 
in my fac e.  I turned to him , "Am I bleeding?"  He s ays , "No, you're not bleeding."  But 
ther e's  a wooden s ign, made a s plinter, hit my face but not enough to c ause bleeding. 
 
 
After it got all quiet, the train s tarted moving again.  At that point allied planes  were always  
over head, s wooping down.  The guards  enc ouraged us  to wave to the planes .  They s till didn't want to 

die.
 
>> 
Bill Bens on: Wave to them  s o they won't attack .
 
>> 
Leon Mer rick:  Yes.  So we s till didn't want to
 
--
 
we wer e m is erable.  We still didn't want to die.  So
 
we waved to them.  Some attacked, s om e didn't.
 
 
Then we went the train started m oving again.  The tr ain s topped at the train s tation.  All of a 
s udden the jets c am e, swooped down.  Before I know, I heard s hooting, shooting.  I jumped up.  It was  

open c attle c ar  this  time.  I jum ped.  I hid under neath the c attle c ar.  I c ould s ee on the s ide the gr avel 
u
p and up.  This  was  going on for s everal days . 
 
 
Another  tim e the tr ain stopped.  The guards  procured a wagon with r aw potatoes.  Everybody 
got one raw potato.  It was  r aining outs ide.  We were shivering c old.
 
 
The las t night, my feet are bubbling.  I c ouldn't walk anym ore.  This guy,
 
walking with m y 
fr iend, I s aid
 
I s een people going to the side and got s hot here, s hot ther e, they're getting killed.  I said 
m aybe s hould r est a little bit.  I k now I'm going to get killed but at leas t I'm getting out of this
 
m is er y.  He 
tells  m e, he s ays , "You stay in the middle.  Lean on m e":  So I leaned on him.  We walked, walked.
 
I heard a dis tant shooting, from  the distanc e I heard som e s hooting.  I thought it was  thunder bec aus e it 
was  raining the day befor e.  All of a s udden, c ame in the m orning, the guar ds  led us  into a big barn.  
Opened up the bar n.  I sat on the s tr aw over there.  My fr iend s at next to me.  All of a s udden an egg 
r olls .  I 
hadn't s een a c hic ken egg in year s .  I br oke it in half.  I gave him half.  I took  the other.  I ate it 
up.
 
 
Then we notic ed the guar ds  ins ide, the guards  were ins ide in the barn.  They tried to pry the 
door  open.  They tried to take the r ifle out.  Looking for white handkerc hiefs .  This c los e, we didn't know 
it. 
 
Maybe another  few 
minutes , the door opens  up.  I s ee white flags hanging all over  the village, white 
flags, s ign to give up.  They give up.  White flags.
  
The guar ds  all of a s udden dis appear ed.  
 
 
I s ee next a Ger m an m ilitary truck .  They have s hoes  over ther e.  Pants.  Whatever , c lothes, 
jackets .  People take jackets  and pants .  I went over  there and dis c arded m y c logs and took  s ome 
s hoes .  I put them on without s ock s , without anything.  I couldn't take them off for  s ever al days .  I had to 
cut them off.
 
 
B ut I'm  fr ee.  I d
idn't r ealize.  I s ee white flags.  This  was  a village.  We go ac ros s the main 
r oad.  I s ee trucks pas s ing by, Am er ic an tr uck s , cars , jeeps .  Thr owing out c  rations.  The militar y, a 
pac kage for  break fas t.  I open m y c
-
r ation.  I tak e out the cracker
, a
 ca
n of c hees e.  It was  s o good.  
[Laughter ] 
 
So we all fr ee.
 
 
So we keep on going further . We pas s ed by a c hurc h.  I r em em ber  the s ame guys  who 
guar ded us, the Germ ans , they were behind the churc h, behind the fenc e.  Som e guy jumping over  the 
fenc e.  They started beating on them.  The Americ an guards, you c an't do that
; i
t's not Ger m any.  
Chas ed them  away.
 
 
We go a bit fur ther  down.  I'm eating c rack ers and c hees e.  I s ee outs ide a Germ an, has one 
of thos e 
Bavarian 
hats , feather s ticking out.  I ask ed him , 
ﬁS
oup, bread?
ﬂ
  
He s ays , 
ﬁY
a, ya, ya.
ﬂ
  
So we 
go ins ide.  The plac e is  full of our people, liberated.  They'r e eating s oup.  I c ould s mell the c hicken 
c ooking.  I s at down.  They gave m e a bowl of s oup.  They gave me eggs. 
 
The next m orning, raw 
eggs. 
 
 
So 
now I am fr ee.  I'm liberated.  I am free.  I didn't know the extent, the Ger mans killed all of 
thos e people.  Didn't know it.  I figur ed now I'm going to go home.  People s aid they wer e going to go 
hom e.  So I wanted to go hom e, too.
 
 
One tim e I went to go home.
 
>> 
Bill Bens on:  To Zgierz?
 

12
 
 
>> 
Leon Merr ick:  To Zgierz.  I s poke to people.  Says , "You're going home?," "You k now they're killi
ng 
J ews  over there?"  I s aid no.
  
They had a Pogr om.  You know what the Pogrom is?  The Pogrom in 
1946, Kielc e, after the war was  over , ok, s om e J ews  c am e back  fr om c oncentr ation c am ps , from hiding.  
They wanted to go back  to their  own hom es.  Maybe they owned a home.  Maybe they jus t lived there.  
The loc als  didn't want them  ther e.  So they killed them.  They had a Pogrom.  If you kill them, you didn't 
have to let them  into the hous e.  Kielc e Pogrom , very well
-
known Pogrom.  
 
 
So I never went back.
  
I went bac k  after wards .  Not at that time.  I went bac k  when I was  a 
fr ee man, living in the United States .  Then I went bac k
. 
>> 
Bill Bens on:  Onc e you were liber ated, you wer e liber ated by the Am er ic ans .
 
>> 
Leon Mer rick:  Yeah.
 
>> 
Bill Bens on:  You would end up going to wor k .
 
>> 
Leon Mer rick:  Yeah!  I was  liberated by the Americ ans.  They had a lot of Polis h J ews
, a
 
c ertain 
h
om e.  They as s em bled there.  I was liv ing am ong Germ ans .  So I went over there.  I c ould s ee they 
had been going out in the daytime proc ur ing c hic ken and food.  The women were c ooking.
 
 
One day I was s tanding near the door , nothing to do.  All of a s udden 
a G.I. c omes  in, first 
tim e, cracking gum, making big bubbles .  He s ays , "We ar e outside in the field. We are in tents . We 
need three guys  to work.  Any of you guys  want to c om e along?"  
ﬁ
Yeah.
ﬂ
  
ﬁ
You s ur e?
ﬂ
  
I have nobody 
her e, nothing.  [Laughter] So I
 says, 
ﬁ Y eah, I'll go.ﬂ
  
 
 
So they took  us out in the field.  The G.I.s, they wer e living in tents.  Ok ?  They had the field 
kitchens .  They m ade us c lean pots and pans.  At the s ame tim e, spagettis , m eatballs .  Oh, didn't s ee 
s paghetti in year s  alr eady. With s auc e.  So I was  working with them  maybe for  two, three week s.  One 
of the s ergeants  c om es to me, he s ays , you know, we are being demobiliz ed now
, g
oing back  to the 
s tates.  We're going now to Franc e.  Dr iving to Franc e.  We c an take you to Franc e and
 
let you off on 
the str eet.  I k now you don't want to be in Germany.  We let you off.  You will be on your own.  Or, he 

pointed at a building
, a
 
hos pital ther e
, o

m ilitar y hos pital.
 
>> 
B ill Bens on:  A U.S. m ilitar y hos pital.
 
>> 
Leon Merr ick:  Yes!  I had a plac e to s leep.  I got my meals .  I was  there.  I wor ked there for three, 
four year s . 
 
>> 
Bill Benson:  Before you wer e able to get to the United States.
 
>> 
Leon Merr ick:  Yeah.  Then I hear d you c an r egis ter .  You'r e a s urvivor.  At that time Pr es ident 
Truman pas s ed a law to admit 205,000
 
--
 
or 500,000 dis plac ed per s ons  or  r efugees, things like this .  
So I c ame.  I went back .
 
>> 
Bill Benson:  I k now we'r e about out of time.  We want to s ee if our  audienc e has  a couple of 
questions . When you c am e to the United States, if I rem ember, you had
 
$3 and then s om ebody gave 
you
 
$20.  Right? 
 
>> 
Leon Merr ick: When I c ame to the United States , I c am e penniles s .  I had nothing.  So I c am e 
thr ough the A m eri

, a

So we got off the boat.  Soc ial worker s  were waiting for us .  They had bands , 
ﬁF

That day the Am er ic an Red Cros s, they gave us  donuts  and c offee.  One lady s ays

opens , you go down and take a seat.  Here's
 
$3.  Buy yours elf lunc h on the train.  [Laughter] 
 
So I t

$3.  I get on the train.  But I didn't buy any lunch becaus e I was  four year s  in Ger m any.  I find s ome 
fr iends , write a pos tc ar d to tell them .  I have to buy pos tage stam p.
 
 
Any way.  She s ays

Leon Mer rick:  That's right.

Bill Bens on:  Leon, I think we've got to c los e our  progr am .

Leon Mer rick:  I guess  so.

Bill Bens on: We didn't have a c hanc e for you to ask ques tions.  But if you have ques tions , when w

would be on liberation day
 y
et this  day finally arr iv ed after s o many years of s uffering, I felt alone.  
I 
did 
not know if my fam
