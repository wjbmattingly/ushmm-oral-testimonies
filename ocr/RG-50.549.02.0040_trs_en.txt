A: I cannot say that -- how it would be wit
hout her, because I™ve always known one life, 
and that was with my  grandmother, and in a 
big family with -- with
 four cousin, which 
was mo re like brothers and si
sters, and I had a very wonde
rful childhood. We
 lived in a 
big house, three stores high. 
My  grandfather, he had passed aw
ay at that time, b u t he had 
-- had had a hotel in Elsinore, our neighbo
r town , and my  grandmother was reasonable 
well off, and we had a wonderful life, and with
 much love. Of course  that was -- might 
be a little b it more old fashioned. There were
 some thing which I saw later on, that our 
maids could do, that we were not allowed to 
do, but really we don™t miss it. W e had a 
very nice, very beautiful
 childhood together.  
Q: What were some of the things that 
you weren™t allowed to do? How was your 
grandmother old fashioned? 
A: Five o™clock, was five o™
clock, and when  she had said something, she was a female 

dictator, so she was ra-rather strict, but I-I do
n™t rememb er any time she hit any of us. It 
wasn™t necessary, yeah. A bli
nk with eyes, a finger lifted. 
Q: [inaudible] 

A:  That™s okay. So -- But w-we
 were not a-afraid of someth
ing, no, no, no, no, but that 
was the way -- that was the rule of the house 
and they  -- the rules we had might be -- was 
a little different from -- from others. There wa
s also a generation, and different from the 
way our maids were brought 
up and the way we were. 
Q: Well, your sister wa s there, so your 
gran dmother was bringing up six children? 
A: Yes.

Q: Okay. So she -- Tell me a little b
it more about her. Wh
at was she like? 
A: She was a very heartful lady. Sh e did new 
-- what she could do for helping people. Bu t 
still she had -- she was Swedish,
 so there a difference betw
een Swedish and Danish. The 
Swedes are lay -- almo st stiff, and -- in their 
way of life, and she ca
me to Denmark, very 
youn -- young and married my  grandfather and 
they made together th
is wonderful hotel, 
and -- and she has always been in a commandi
ng position, and she was that to her last 
day. So -- But our home was full of love and 
we had all the things we wanted  to have to  
play. We had the big garden. We lived in Sn
agerstein, that is three miles south of 
Elsinore. We had -- From our 
windows we could see over th
e sounds of Sweden. We -- 
Every summer, we -- we wot out swimming and sa
iling. We had the boat very  near to us, 
so we had it, really, a wonde
rful life. So -- A-And she was, of course, the manager of all 
the things, who make it possible. 

Q: You said that she was -- that she gave th
ings, that she reached out to people. Can -- 
Can you talk a little bit about that, what you 
remember of her as you were growing up? 
A: No, really, I dow -- just know that peop le came and -- and what -- what they got, I 

don™t know. But I know during the war, she 
was very helpful in many ways to people 
who had no clothes, because she gave, of cour
se, what we ha-have left over -- be -- so, 
she -- she was very h-heartly in 
-- in her way of living. But th
e small details is difficult to 
remember. 

Q: What do you recall about re
ligion, growing up, or faith? Di
d you go to  church, or were 
there any habits or rituals at home, that you recall?

A: My home was a typical Danish four wh eel 
Christian life. You know
, you go to church  
when you on f-four wheels, 
for baptism, for wedding, confirmation, funeral and 
Christmas eve. We were not -- Of course, we
 believed, but we were not church -goer, not 
church-goer. We -- No, I -- I really think that
 the only religious influence in the house 
was that grandma, every mo rning, 8:30, listened to the radio from the dume in 
Copenhag en, there was every day, a -- a 10 minute sermon. And th at -- that was -- But, 
we were not church-goer. First of all, there w a
s quite a long distance to church . And, by 
the way, my  grandmother was not very fond 
of the minister. He was from what we -- I 
would call a very Orthodox, and very narrow 
minded part of the Danish church, called 
Internal Mission. That, you know, everything 
was prohibited, but you were allowed to 
put cream and sh oke in the coffee, but not ter. 
Q: Not to stir it? 

A: Thas -- Hey wa -- Tha -- That™s the right, that
™s right, that -- that part of -- of course it 
not -- not true with the coffee, 
but in that way, that everythi
ng was s-sinful. And that was 
too Orthodox fo r my  grandma. 
And th-the sermons from the radio, that was something 

else, that w as a more Reformed
, and open form of religion. Bu
t, of course, the religions, 
the bages should be the same , bus all 
the outfits, which make the difference. 
Q: What -- You™ve talked a little
 bit about the love in your 
household, and the -- the s -- 
the structure, the discipline. What else do 
you rememb er about values your grandmother 
taught you, or perhap s a sort of 
a philosophy, as you 
were growing up? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0040

Q: There was no [indecipherable] kind of -- I r
eally think that she thought that if we did 
what she did, it was okay [indecipherable] exam
ple. I -- I just think that™s -- that was her 
idea. She was not a -- a big thinker. We had 
too mu ch to do, but sh
e was a good pe -- a 
good -- a good wo man, and we loved her, and 
so I have had a childhood wh ich was quite 
out of this world. When  I hear about what™s
 going on [indecipherable] well, that™s a -- I 
enjoy to think back
 a-at that time. 
Q: What did your grandmother do all day? Y
ou said there was some  financial resources, 
was she working at all, fro
 -- a garden, or anything? 
A: I understand you are a young American. If 
you have tol -- as-ask
ed this to -- to a 
Danish girl in that age, ﬁI have six childre
n, I have a big house,
 and you say wh -- ask 
what I do?ﬂ I really think that 
-- We had, of course -- There was an aunt living with us, a-
and she was so wonderful, and wa -- that was 
my grandfather™s sister, never married, and 
was -- was the lady who took care of the kitc
hen and all this. And then we h -- always 
had a girl, a maid. But those ga -- a -- a big 
garden, you know. That
 was the only thing I 
hated, it was to pick up the le
aves from the -- the -- 
the leaves of roses. That was a big, 
and a boring job. But th ere was a big ga
rden, and my -- my grandmother was very 
interested in -- in gardens. So, sh
e got plen ty to do, plenty  to do. 
Q: I want to talk a little b
it about politics. I mean, did 
-- did you ever hear politics 
discussed at the dinner table? What -- What were y -- her ideals, or perhaps even yours? 
At this point, you™re 13 -14 - 
15. How were you getting some 
of your political ideas?  A-

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0040
 
 
8
 
 
 
 
A-And it doesn™t have to be specifically with 
a specific party, but just ideas about how 
things should be. 
A: You see that, in Denmark, we ha -- fo
r all the years when  I was young, mixed 
government between the social democrats and a radical party. And, you mu st recall that, 
in the 30™s, after the Black We
dnesday in ™29, Denmark had 
had very -- indeed, very bad 
economical conditions. A big part of our -- ou
r export was agriculture, and the first -- 
everybody stopped in Britain, was our biggest 
market, that was agriculture products. So 

there was a really big unemployment in Denmar
k in the beginning of the 30™s, and there 
was, even then, not any tension t -- revolutio
n or to Communism, all this, because there 
was a social welfare in Denmark. A social 
welfare, which was backed up even by the 
mo re conservative parties, so there was uni 
-- unity ab out -- to give the people who was 
not so good off as we, a helping hand. And afte
r ™36, it turns a little b
it, and in ™38, just 
before the war, we had a reasonable good situa
tion, and of course the social demo crat got 
the credit for that, and that is okay. And, at
 the same time, a certain Mr. Hitler, made his 
number in -- in Germany. We
 thought that Hitler was a cl
own. We und-un
derestimated 
that guy. His screamin g, his completely dire
cted reviews. He -- When we saw him in the 
picture -- the pictures of him, when we -- wh
en we heard him in -- in the radio, on -- on 
film, or this newsreels, it was -- w-we couldn
™t understa -- we really thought the man 
mu st be crazy. And that gave Denmark an in
jection against narcissism, because that was 
also completely foolish for us 
to believe that anybody are s
upermen. I never forget, we as 
Danes, was so -- the best of all the Aryans, w
ith our blue eyes, our blonde hair, and -- and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0040
 
 
9
 
 
 
 
all this. And we couldn™t u-understand anything 
out of -- and therefore, in Denmark, there 
was a feeling of certainness, that that guy co
uld never be a threat. That was ™36 - ™37. 
There was a -- that w -- I say, here was not
 something I knew that time, because as 10 
years old, you are not that interest. But, th
e [indecipherable] was th
at when he had passed 
the bridge over Rhine, the river Rhine, an
d taking over the old German socketbeat 
without, and he was shooting at him. Maybe 
the whole wo rld could have -- be something 
else today, this day in April, in ™99, wh er
e we talk about Kosovo. If somebody had shot at 
the German army crossing the bridges over Rh ine in 1936, maybe millions of people had 
been alive today. I don™t know, but I say it be
cause that gis -- my impression what™s right 
or wrong in Kosovo. 

Q: Do you remember wh
en you first began to form your
 own idea about Hitler? Do you 
reme mb er listening to th e radio, perhaps with
 your gran dmother, or 
aunt, or perhaps other 
people, neighbors, or -- 
A: I can say the day ex actly, the ninth of Apr
il, 1940, I woke up and -- because there was 
airplanes in the air. We had -- To
 see an airplane in that -- the -- in those days, that was 
something special, but here was lots of them
, coming up from south, over the river Sund, 
and they were -- the destination were Norway
, because that was the day Hitler occupied 
Denmark and Norw ay. And then  they came b
ack and they -- then 
went over Copenhagen , 
and we have heard about the bomb ardment of 
Wachau, in the year be
fore, when the start 
of the war started, and afterwards, we got th
e -- the message that Hitler has threatened to 
bomb Copenhagen if we did not 
-- gave up and sign th e treaty th
at let -- he should take 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0040
 
 
10
 
 
 
 
over the power and -- and all this
. And we had that time, 13,000 sold ier, that was all, and 
somebody was killed at the -- at the border 
between Ge-Germany and 
Denmark. That day 
I got my  impression wh at -- a ma n who have ma
de a non-aggressive treaty with us, and 
broke it, that man was no good, and he was ce
rtainly not a clown, but he was a threat. 
And from the -- that day, I -- I despised the ma
n, and the regime. But I think that goes for 
many, many, many. I was 13 years, that ni-nin
th of April, and it was strange because I 
had to go to the station. I went to school in
 Copenhag en, that was a dri -- a drive of about 
an hour or so, and non -- in th
e train, I™ve heard about it. We have to -- seen the planes 
and all this, but wh en  we came to the -- to Copenhagen , we had to  stop one station befo re 
Norb el, and w-w-w -- had to go
 out of the train and up in
 the streets, we heard the 
German soldiers. And that was a shock. I wa
s really in shock. And -- But we could do 
nothing. [indecipherable] dreams that you can 
have a gun and shoot, all that. Well, wund 
-- it became a normal day later. Where we lived,
 we saw no German soldiers. I saw them 
when  I was a-at school in Copenhagen, and I 
really think Denmark is a sha -- I reme mb er 
that™s the first time in all our history, we
 have lost all freedom. And I know it s-seems 
maybe a little pathetic, but freedom is some
thing you don™t talk about, and don™t know 
exists until you lose it. Then you™ll find out wh
at it mean s. This -- To live, one day in a 
country with law and order, the 
next in a country where you do
 not know what is law and 
order, because the other set up what you have to
 be and say, that is difficult. All this -- 
For instance, with the news. From one day to 
another, we just had one side of the news. 
And that was the main  reason that we young 
people, of course, guided by grown-ups, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0040
 
 
11
 
 
 
 
came in -- very young in
 the illegal press work. As paper 
boys, we distributed -- and to 
me it was very clear. I went to school in Co
penhagen, I lived on th e country side in -- in 
Willet, so it was naturally I had some pape
rs with me, and gave them to people who I 
knew would en -- wo uld use them right, beca
use that was all informations. W-W-We 
tried to listen to BBC, but the Germans ma
ke some disturbings jop, so it was very 
difficult. You sh ould have seen all the ante
nnas you tried to make, in order to get the 
news from BBC, th ree times a day. And, again,  BBC was the truthful news media. But, 

maybe they™ll be just as muss -- misunder
standings from their si
de. Beeb -- The -- The 
German™s news from the different fronts, was 
always taken as 100 percent lies. But on 
the other side, in the fort -- in ™40, what
 happened? Ho lland, Belg ium, France fell. 
Dunkirk. It was a very, very sad time. It was ve
ry difficult to keep up 
this stee. That was -
- And our govern ment, we had a govern ment 
at that time, the-they make collaboration 
with the Germans, which we di
dn™t like. We --  We thought 
they were cowards. That™s 
easy to say when you are not sitting at the fir-- in the first row, but that was a very 

shameful feeling, that we have failed, that 
we now saw that England was very, very hard  
pressed, and there was none in Europe, who c
ould help . Never forget that on -- in the ™40, 
they had still the pact between 
Stalin and Hitler. It was just 
-- there was no way out of it. 
Q: C-Can -- Can you talk a little bit more a
bout people felt about 
how your government 
reacted, and what they would 
have liked to have seen? 
A: I think th at mo st people, they
 thought, oh hey, comme ci, comme 
a, it™s going. We 
have still our steak every Sunday, and we have st
 -- still that and that. That™s -- It™s not 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0040
 
 
12
 
 
 
 
that bad, and that™s -- But, the young pe
ople, who had -- out from the -- the point of 
shame, some other interest. We wanted someth
ing should  happen. Of course, mo st of the 
people of that part, were quite young.
 They  had no responsib ilities. I cannot today 
understand that maybe I 
would had another meani
ng, another opinion of things, if I™ve -- 
had been married, and two or th
ree kids. But, we thought th
at we did too little to show 
that Denmark should  again be a free country . And that was -- But on the other side, every 
b -- I think that some Danes believed that H
itler will win the war. But there were never a 
great Nazi party in Denmark. The two -- two a
nd a half percent, that was -- may b e three, 
was -- and many of them came because -- and th
at -- that™s completely crazy --because of 
the pact between Germany and Soviet Union.
 And Soviet Union™s attack on Finland. 
There was a fro -- Finnish feelings in Denmar
k, and we really found
 that Soviet Union 
and Germany were the same ba
d taste. And some people, they went to fight against 
Russia in Finland and some of 
these people later on, when H
itler attacked Russia in 1941, 
joined Hitler, in order to -- it 
should benefit Finland. Finla
nd joined Hitler in that war. 
But there was this northern feelings for a -- a 
brother land, and -- but that -- that was only 
a few people in Denmark, most --

A: The most people, they were completely 
indifferent. But then, time went on and we, 
from the [inaudible] started w
ith distributing illegal papers, now started to print them 
themself. We got a -- a dummy 
from -- from one place in Cope
nhagen, had, by different 
person, got paper. That was a ve
ry big proten, to get paper for it, and then we made a 
copy, wh ich we otherw ise would have brought 
hundreds copies, then we made more self, 
and that™s -- that was our very, very
 brav e assistance, [indecipherable] 
Q: I want to go through this step by step
. Can you first remember w h -when this idea 
arose? A-And you talk about we, wh-w ho is
 we? If you could tell me who these people 
were, and -- and if you can think back, were 
you sitting around and yo
u decided that, let™s 
do th is, or did someone approach  you? 

A: No, be -- Yes, i-it was -- the first thing was,
 that at my  school in Copenhagen, that was 
the oldest school in de -- in Denmark, me
 -- the Metropolitan school. We had very good 
teachers. It was very national school, a very  An
glo-Saxon kind of scho
ol, and there was -- 
there they started with connec
tion to the university. And s -- one of my  schoolmates had 

some of these papers, it -- brought to the 
school sometimes, and I said, ﬁCan I have 
some?ﬂ Yes, and then it start in
 that way, and we were influenced by our teachers, very 
much indeed. And they -- to 
them, it was very important, because they  were academic. 
They  were Latin, Greek people. They could do 
that, they were experts -- they we -- were 
-- because of their background, very demo
cratic. And that -- say, ab out the whole 
background in the school, and th en, from [inde
cipherable] I started with two or three 
papers, and later on, we made them ourselves. 
And we, that is my ma
tes i-in Snagerstein, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0040
 
 
14
 
 
 
 
playmates, were people who, we had grow
n up togeth er, same  ag
e, 16 - 17 years old, 
when we -- we got the -- it™s a po
ssibility to make our own paper. 
Q: So at first -- I want to just go through 
th is, a friend came with some papers and you 
asked for a few, and then you to ok them
 and distributed them, is that it? 
A: Yes. 
Q: Okay . 
A: We gave them to people we knew would be
 interested in them. And then, later on, it™s 
most -- quite natural that we made this 50 - 
60 copy a month and brought them to people, 
and sometimes, if something sp ecial happene
d, we had one page, wh ich they  -- we 
brought out for -- I remember one of the main
 thing was when Stalingrad fell, it was a 
very, very  hot number. And also, when  there 
happened something in
 Denmark, the first 
murder. B-Because everything escalated. And -- 

Q: The first murder? 
A: That was -- That was -- We called it a cleary murder. Where the 
Germans shot a Dane 
who have done not
hing. Just killed him on -- If, fo
r instance, w -- the -- the -- an 
informant for -- a Nazi informan
t was a danger for the resistance movement, he, after the 
case was seen really through, th at there will be no mistake, 
then he was liquidated. And 
then, always, when one of this 
hi -- Nazi serv ants, they wereshot, that was cleary murder. 
And then , that was comp letely innocen t peop
le. And normally, was mo re than one, this 
would be doubled up, or something like th at
. And also, when  there was a big sabotage. 
And sabotage was -- I never was involved in
 that, but sabotage was also a reaso n able 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0040
 
 
15
 
 
 
 
selfish thing that we did. Because when  we
 -- not we, but when 
the saboteurs got the 
order from England, this factory is dangerou
s because they  are making that. It is mu ch 
better that we, in Denmarks, had people wh o 
set the -- the -- the bomb inside and blew it 
up. You see what happen when  
you have air attacks? We saved quite a lot of civil lives 
by sabotage, and it™s mu ch mo re precise. 
And th e people who was work ing in the 
factories who were blown up, 
they were warned, and they came out. That means it was a 
human, much better way to be self-destructiv
e, than to have the British and American 
aircrafts coming over and bombing. So, therefor
e, i -- sabotage was a very serious attack 
on the German war machine, and that was, th
erefore, that the Germans, in ™43, the 29
th
 of 
August, where there have been quite a lot of
 sabotage before, that 
was railway, it means 
that the transportation between Germany andNorway, which normally went through the 

Danish headlines, they were disturbed, and 
then the -- the Germans demanded that there 
should be again, a general punishment for 
sabotag e and for carrying weapon. Then  the 
Danish government said no, we can™
t do that. And the Danish government 
[indecipherable] Danish government resigned,
 but there was not appointed a ne -- new 
government, and the -- it m -- had the effect th
at the Danish administration continued, but 
the leader was not a political secretary, but 
the man who was chief of the office. And not 
elected, it was an administration, and that
 administratio n continued until the day of 
liberation, the fifth of May, 1945.

Q: A few mo re details about the period wh en
 you™re distributing papers. When  this young 
man who initially gave you the paper, did -- I me
an, did you have to 
be interviewed, or 
checked out in some 
way to become a part of this network? 
A: Only  people they  knew got it. It was not 
necessary, and af -- and whe-where I live, the 
school -- okay [indecipherable] sc
hoolmate and the people I ha
d contact with in my home 
Willet, I knew very well. So, it was not necessa
ry to -- to have this check out. We -- We 
knew it was people who stand for. 
Q: And yet, there could have 
been  people wh o were collabora
ting secretly. Was there that 
fear at all? Did you ha
ve any misgivings, and 
how were you careful? 
A: We knew who were Nazi in our little to
wn. That was no prob -- we had one or two 
who had these crazy ideas, a -- but they were 
not memb er of society any mo re. They  were 
ap -- only to they -- a -- a kind of outcast, 
we -- because their mentality was that long 
from ours. So, no, that was no -- there was n-no 
danger there. Peoples who came out of -- 
from some wheres, it could be difficult, but then 
-- then we could make an re -- in-inquiry 
somewhere, but it was never necessary, but 
we had people enough
, the young people in 
Snagerstein was almost h
undred percent involved. 
Q: Ho-H ow many young people we
re involv ed, would you say? 
A: I think we were n -- 15 in the little village. 

Q: Okay. Now, is this something that
 your grandmother knew you were doing? 

A: No.  
Q: Why not? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0040

A: Oh, well, later on she says 
she wo-w ould have been very, 
very  sorry if we didn™t had. 
But I think that was her fear for the conseq
uences, and well, I don™t know, I think th at 
mo st fathers and mo thers, or grandmothers, don™
t want to let something be a risk for their 
children. I -- What we did wa
s okay, that was right, but wh
y just you? I think -- I think 
that was that. But she would,
 without doubt, have denied
 me to do it, I suppose, I 
suppose.  
Q: S-So you did have to be secretive. I m
ean, how did you -- tell me
 a little bit about that. 
How were you careful? Ho -- Where did you 
carry the papers? If you were dropping it off 
at someone™s house, who you sa
id would be interested, how 
did you do that? Give me a 
sense of how you did th at. 
A: Just like a normal delivery boy deliver thi
ngs. You go to the door, knock at the door, 
give it to the right person. That™s all [i
ndecipherable]. Only once I was -- another man 
saw it, and that was a policeman who stopped me. But he was a policeman, and he™d  
come t -- later on, it meant something, becau
se he stopped me b -- th -- I don™t know 
whether it™s the l-lights on my bike that wa
s not okay, but he saw what I had in my  
briefcase, and uh-huh, good. B
ecause that is the most importa
nt thing, that the Danish 
police, most of all, really was loyal to the Da
nes, not to the Germans.  I must admit that in 
Copenhagen, there was a -- a group of police -- 
of people who was really Nazi infiltrated. 
[indecipherable] And -- But not in our area. 
Th -- know that the policemen there have 
known us for  [indecipherable
] children. So -- But that was the only time -- bu-but he 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0040

didn™t take any of the papers. That was befo
re we -- we ever printed it ourself, that was 
something I brought from the school. 
Q: Tell me -- What -- Did -- Did th e newspape
r that you had brought 
from the school, did 
it have a name? 
A: That was Studentinus Iftatin, the Student™s News. 

Q: Okay . And when  they actua
lly got news, were they -- ho
w did they get news and th en 
put it in the newspaper? 

A: Well, they had from BBC, and the nati
onal news, the -- okay, you know, that 

everything goes faster than -- than the lightning.
 So they -- First of all, what ha -- the 
criticism of the government, and we had very
 good writers. Later on, we saw -- saw one 
of the best journalists was in there, and auth
ors and all this, who was forbidden to -- they 
couldn™t get their stuff in the papers, and ther
efore, they came fra -- came through the i-
illegal papers. Tha-That™s the way you can 
communicate, and that was the only way. 
There were hundreds of different small -- sm
all, illegal p apers. There were some special 
from Elsinore, from the more -- there was a paper named ﬁInformation.ﬂ After the war, it 

became a daily papers. And there was the 
Communist illegal paper, ﬁCountry and 
People.ﬂ And there was -- fr-fro
m the more li-left side, from
 the more right side, there 
was really quite a lot for -- for different -- Th
ere was a man, Nils Swanson, he made his 

own paper, called Ils [indecipherab le] 
Jutland. H-H-H-He was from Jutland. 
[indecipherable] letters. And th
ey were -- found through the 
nation distribution. They  -- 
They were overall, because some got it, and 
copy it, and send it. That™s the way it was.

Q: Gi -- You said that somebody be -- was a -- a -- a very good writer, and became a well 
known journalist. What -- Who is the name of that person? 
A: Outsede, O-u-t-sed-e. He was famous. An
d many of the -- the -- the authors ra -- made 
articles in the -- in this illegal papers under 
nom de guerre. And th at was -- the only way 
to -- to have your talk -- the normal papers ha
d censorship. That was very difficult to -- to 
write anything against Hitler, against Germany. That was not a llowed. And in the -- in the 
radio, the same thing. There was a -- a censo
rship there. There was a man with a finger 
on th e button, that if something not special 
good for [indecipherable] you cut off. So th at 
was -- And the papers had to fo llow the instru
ction, otherwise we wo
uld ge-get no paper. 
So it was rather - a little bit necessary, with the illegal papers, and all that. A little part of 
the -- of the truth. But the ne-n
ewsreels, theywere 
just about all the German riksers, all 
what they  could do. But also they™re -- Ne
ver forget, we came through it because of 

humor, too. Humor was -- was reas
onable. In that time it was 
so that the cinema played 
twice a day, seven and nine in th e evening. 
And always there was th
is German newsreel, 
and the -- one day there was, on the first perf
ormance, seven o™clock, the newsreel said, 
ﬁAnd we had an attack on England, and we
 shot 110 enemy aircrafts down. On e of our 
own are missing.ﬂ There was a man sit -- fro m 
the halls who said, ﬁDon™t worry, guys, 

it™ll be back at the nine performance.ﬂ But, 
humor, I really think we -- humor has also 
something to do with su
rviving, and might be there, Jews and Danes are -- have a little b it 
in commo n. We don™t like, for instance, a Je
w -- Jewi -- stories about Jews. Well, we 
don™t tell them ourself. We have -- There was 
also, in ™43, Fieldmarshall Goering visited 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0040

Denmark, and he wanted to see a Viking ship
. And then he went out where there was an 
old Viking ship, the [indecipherab le] and wh
en Marshall Goering came and saw it, he -- 
and he said, ﬁHm, is that all?ﬂ And the little
 man who was in care of the -- that museum 
said, ﬁYes, that is all, Fieldm
arshall. But with this
 ships, we conquered
 England.ﬂ See, th 
-- such story, told in a depressed situation, 
give a little light, a little 
smile, and is also why 
you surv ive, reasons of survival, that, oh well,
 it bad, but it c-could 
be better, it would be 
better. 
Q: Now, at this point, you™re very invo
lved  in these newspapers. H-H-Ho w are you 
thinking? How do you -- What are you thinki
ng about what you™re 
doing? Do you think 
to yourself, I™m a member of 
this informal resistance? Ho w do you make -- yeah, make 
sense of what you™re doing? 

A: Yes, but what else could 
we do? You see, that™s so st
range that you all will -- shall 
have a reason. That is the only right to 
do. It has nothing to d -- with deep phil-
philo sophy, it was a must. Somebody had to
 do th ese things. And well, why shouldn™t it 
be me? All my -- my nearest fr
iends do the same thing. We™re
 together in it, and okay, 
it™s also funny to  cheat the Ge
rmans a little bit. I cannot -- I 
cannot go from that s-side of 
the story to that. It was irritating for the Germ
ans to know that all th eir lies is not at all 
believed. And th erefore, I always take what is
 coming from every general, in east or west, 
was some -- a little bit of okay, 
maybe, maybe. I hope it™s right, but -- 
Q: Did you -- Were -- Did you ev
er have an opportunity to 
choose to do something like 
sabotage, and what were your thoughts about it? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0040
 
 
21
 
 
 
 
A: I was never -- never -- remember I was that
 young. Sabotag e, that was for grown-ups. 
It means that should at 
least been 18. So -- 
Q: You were about 14? 
A: N -- Yes, in -- in ™40 - ™41, f -- but when I 
started, i-it was in ™42 really, I was 16. So -- 
But no, I was never -- not any possibility. An
d that was also mostly a big town -- 
Q: Okay . 
A: -- affair. Even if one of the most important
 groups -- no, that wasn™t sabotage, that was 
people received weapon from -- from air. 
The w-weapon which wa
s sent down from 
American and British aircraft. Well, that 
was guns, that was ammu nition, that was 
detonators and all these explosives. A
nd that was mostly fr-from people from the 
countryside. They kn-knew -- kn ew the area, they wa
s much better in pos
ition to  hide this 
-- the different materials they got down . And 
-- But I™m -- I was never involved in that, 
too. And the reason why I was involved in  -- in
 the October actions, was because of that 
policeman, wh-w ho -- he came one day and 
s -- that was beginning [indecipherable] and 
said go an d pick some people
 out from the station and bring them, and he s -- gave me 
some addresses. And -- 

Q: Who was that policeman? 
A: He was the man [indeciphe
rable]. You got that book? 

Q: We™re looking through a book that Mr. Munc
h Nielsen brought and 
will be part of his 
file, and part of the -- the Holocaust archives.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0040
 
 
22
 
 
 
 
A: Mr. Chumla Larsen. The guy here, and he 
had the -- the big influence, because he was 
a police officer and had wi -- he was in the fo
reign police, and he ha
d the connection with 
the Swedish Mr. Palmroot, you will see too 
him, in the book, because they worked 
together from the -- one from Danish and one
 -- one from Swedish side. And therefore, 
he was able to have more news, more inform
ations. And he came a
nd he was the founder 
of the group called Elsinore So
okgloop. Elsinore Sewing Cl
ub, it means nothing, but the 
child should have a name, and that was the na
me. And they were the 
owner of the book -- 
of the boat you see on this mu seum -- in th
e Holocaust museum. Th
e fish -- the -- the 21 
feet motorboat. 
Q: Who was [indecipherable] 
A: This si -- The Elsinore Sewing Club. 

Q: Okay . 

A: And that was used there in October, for tr
ansporting quite a lot of people. In October, 
Jews most, but later on, it was used as care
er boat, as gun running
 with -- from Sweden 
with weapons for the 
Danish resistant movement. And Da
nish resistant movement people 
had to go to Sweden, it was al
so -- some allied soldiers 
shot down  over Denmark, who 
had the lu ck to go to th e coast on Canova, a
nd they -- they were -- we had more boats, but 

this boat was the only -- was -- still wa
s there when  the mu seum required it. 
Q: Before we -- we move on to that whole 
chapter, I™m -- I™m just
 ask you a few mo re 
questions about the period in your -- in your
 life when you were wo rking with your s-
student friends and distribu
ting newspapers. I wonder ifyou could -- In your initial

interview, you mentioned a teacher that ha
d made an impression on you and guided you, 
and I wonder if you could tell us the teacher™s
 name, and -- and more -- a little bit more 
about him. He -- He became a -- an impor
tant person in the 
whole situation. 
A: Froida Yacobsen was the name. He was a so
cial democrat. He was 
very, very soon in 
the action against the Nazis. He was a career 
between th e Danish  social demo crat party, 
and the -- the German social democrats. He 
was in Germany very  often, on bicycle and 
[inaudible] he was in the organization Matc
ha Otchie. And they 
helped many Germans 
when the party was forbidden 
by Hitler. And he was so anti-
Nazi, and anti-Fascism. And 
of course, he was not a -- a real te
acher, he was, what do you call it? 
Q: An apprentice. 
A: He was an apprent-apprenter -- 

Q: An apprentice. 

A: Apprentice, okay. As -- A -- He should le
arn to teach and the-there were always a 
normal teacher togeth er with him, but he has --

Q: This is a continuation of a United States
 Holocaust Memorial Mu
seum interview with 
Preben Munch Nielsen. This is
 tape number two, side A. 
Okay, you were tellin g us about 
Froida Yacobsen . 
A: Oh yeah. He was one of the me n who st
arted the Danish resistant movement, and 
when  there was Council of Freedom, he was one of the first mem- memb ers, and he made 
a tremendous job fo r the rest of the wa
r, and had, together with people like 
[indecipherable] he wa-was later the -- the he
ad of the Copenhagen
 University, a doctor, 
and many other people, they really administ
rated the resistant movement™s actions. There 
was no power for them, it was just done. In ™44,
 some of them were arrested, but they  -- 
some of them wa-was freed 
again because of a -- a bombard
ment of the jail where they 
were. And that was -- Again that -- It™s very
 difficult when s -- things comes by an air 
attack, because one of the bo
mbs fell in a sch ool, that Fr
ench school in Copenhagen, 
where 150 kids were killed. It was -- Therefor
e, we were thankful for what the saboteurs 
did.  
Q: Who was bombing? 
A: That was the British. And the -- It was a 
mistake on the -- but, we see the -- the risk 
when  -- when you have the -- the bombard ments. 
Q: If you could just help me understand a little
 bit. Did you understa
nd that he was such 
an important figure wh en he was in your school
 as an apprentice, or was it later that you 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0040
 
 
25
 
 
 
 
understood what he had done, or
 -- and -- and -- and, if so, what -- what were you aware 
of him? I mean, what was he like? 
A: He was a little man . He was very strong in
 gestures, and talking 
very loud, and he did 
not make silence about his hates to ger -- to  -- not Germans, he loved Germany, but he 
hated the Nazis. He was a Socialist, and our 
school was very conservative, but he was a 
premed -- very fine teacher, and his idea abou
t freedom was not to ove
rlook. And first -- 
later, I understood -- I was not -- I -- I agree co
mp letely, because he was that kind of man 
who could do so mething -- aga-ag ain these peop
le were [indecipherable] or were -- were 
heart and people -- maybe a little bit of a dema
gogue, but well, he needed to be that on 
that time. It was a stran g e time, an d la
ter I met him many, many times. We had one 
meeting a year, that was the opening of a artis
t -- a gallery, where s -- thus -- a union of -- 
of -- not union, a company of artists, they show
 what they have done for the last year, and 
he was from Impa just like we, my wife an
d me, and we met there every year. And -- 
Until last year, he died a little -- y ear ago.
 He was 89, or something like. He was a 
marvelous pers-personality, and he really made 
us forget a little bit of
 the shame we had. 
We also had another teacher, he was the fi
rst man who really, in Denmark, wrote a -- 
against Fascist man, and th e nasic idea. He
 wrote a book, ﬁPlagu
e over Europe,ﬂ where 
he defined what Fascism was. He was late
r on Secretary of Education in  a social 
demo crat govern ment. So -- Bu t he -- he had 
it -- he was mo re on the philoso phic part of 
a ger, where he really f -- make us even
 more to dislike th
e Nazi philosophy.

Q: What would you say your teacher -- appr
entice teacher, Froida Yacobsen, what -- 
what did you take away from him? What 
did you do, do you thi
nk you learned? You 
know, you -- you mentioned that you felt less sh
ame, you were very proud of him, but di 
-- did you take away any other things from him?  
A: Yes, but his idea that you have to stand up 
when  thing is not right. You cannot just, as 
a good Christian, turn the left
 chin, when you are beaten on 
th e right. You have to -- and 
under these circumstances, during the war, du
ring occupation, you 
had to stand up and 
show that you -- [indecipherable] things, th
at we™ll not -- we™ll be bound of -- and 
especially because the id
eas they wanted us to believe in 
was all against our ideas, against 
our belief. It was opposites all what we have learned to love and -- and believe in. So , he 

gave us this -- the matu ration, what to do. If 
you want to be a full 
man, you will have to 
do so mething maybe you don™t dare to do. Bu
t you do it. That™s the only way we -- we 
can survive. It was, in
 1941, ™42, ™43, up to  ™45, a matte
r of survival. It 
wa-was about the 
future of our country. If Hitler had won the 
war, okay we as Danes, maybe would be -- ha 
-- been the next ins -- command af
ter the wonderful SS. To me it™s -- the greatest fun is to 
see these w o nderful Aryans, Hitler and Goebbels, 
in the -- in the front
. But that should be 
the types and samp les of the Aryan fu
tu re [indecipherable]. I don™t buy it.  
Q: At this point, what did -- At this point, 
what is going on with the 
king of your country ? 
D-Do you ever see him, a
nd wh at do you th ink about ho
w he™s conducting himself? 
A: The king of Denmark was, as typical Danish kings, not 
true intelligent. But he was a 
very stubborn man, and he was stubborn at 
the right time. He was an -- no would ever 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0040
 
 
27
 
 
 
 
deny that, the gallant pawn for Denmark. He 
made a fantastish way out
 of delod. He -- in 
the start, when he rode through Copenhagen
 every day, and the Ge
rmans soldiers, they 
saluted him, he looked to the other side. 
And he -- Once, a German ask people, ﬁHow c-
come that your king is riding here? Where™
s his guard s?ﬂ And the underlings answered, 
ﬁWe are the g-guard.ﬂ He could do that, he wa
s respected. He -- He did it wonderful his -
- he stood up. I know that™s a story about him 
that -- th at he would wear the yellow star, if 
-- if -- but that™s not true. There was never a yellow star in Denmark, but the story is 
good, and if the situation had 
been  so, he would have done 
it, no doubt, no doubt. But the 
-- that™s one of the stories who are not true, but
 in a way, bear a bit 
of truth in -- in the 
self , because he would have done it, no doubt.
 He never talked about Jews or Italians, he 
talked about Danes. My citizens are Danes, 
and -- and that™s all. He was the first king 
ever to visit a synagogue. And that was before
 the war, but you see, i-it™s -- that™s a game 
that, it™s to show that the Jews we
re a part of the Danish society. 
Q: He used to ride his horse -- when you™re
 talking ab out riding, 
he was riding his horse. 
Did you ever see him?  

A: Yes, many times.  
Q: Describe it. 
A: Yes, but you see, he came from the castle, 
through one of the streets there, and ladies, 
they went out and [indecipherable] out, you 
know, turn, turn
. That was Denmark coming, 
and nothing else, and he did it 
in a marvelous, good way. Bu t 
then, one day he s -- fell off 
the horse, there was something happening, an
d that was the last 
time. And then, from 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0040

August -- August 29
th
, he had to  give up his guard , an
d police troops came in, Danish, in 
order to -- to protect him, but from that ti -- we
 didn™t see him. And that was again that he 
was -- yeah, his leg was hurt, I don™t know wh
ether it -- it was amp u tated, I -- I just know 
that he couldn™t -- couldn™t walk  and -- but 
he was a marvelous king, from ™40 to ™45 -- 
™47, he died , in ™47. And he
 was very beloved, and he wa
s mar ried t o  a German princess 
who se -- from the ninth of Ap ril, never woul
d receive any relatives on the castle -- of the 
German relatives. That was -- But our -- We ha
ve very good fa -- good royal family. Oh 
well, we have had it since year 900. King Gom 
the Old, so we have grown accustomed to 
their ways. 
Q: His -- His name was King Christian? 
A: The 10
th
. 
Q: The 10
th
? 
A: Yes.  
Q: I-I -- I w ant to see if you recall, when you
 first began getting some inkling that things 
were shifting in the country, sp ecifically with -- that -- th at Jews might be rounded up by 
the -- the Nazis? Do you remember how 
you heard about it or
 who told you? 
A: That policeman who came and said to me
, I have heard rumors about -- that somebody 
has been arrested, and -- but at that time, 
it often happened that Germany stopped some 

people and -- and then they were arrestedand sent to -- to Germany. But now it was a 

whole group. The Jews, the -- and well, I wa
s first aware of it the day wh en I was not 
asked, but told to go pi
ck these people up, and bring them there. And -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0040
 
 
29
 
 
 
 
Q: And you -- where were you? We
re you at home at that time? 
A: I was -- I was at home, a night, making my
 loy for next day™s school, and then he 
came and said, do that and that, an
d I did, an d that was a start. 
Q: Do you reme mb er approxi
mately when that was?  
A: It was in -- in be -- the beginning of 
October, second, third of October, and it was 
strange to see these people come there, with 
their trunks and co mp letely out of their -- 
know, they were, in a way, ra
ther quiet, but you -- you could 
see they were afraid, and -- 
that was -- that was really the first day I re
ally fully understood wh
at we were fighting 
for. What the -- What™s it all a
bout. And well -- But then, when 
they came to the different 
houses, with people I knew, of course. Okay, 
 come in, see so and so, and so on. No 
Christian asked them -- later on, when I as
k why we should do that. Because we knew 
everybody, we knew where there was a dog,
 we knew how -- yes, because who maybe 
would bark. We knew exactly how to find ev
ery path in the wood. We knew also, how 
you can go from one garden to another, without
 going on the street. 
So, that was -- that 
was the first assignment we got, and w-we we
re, let™s see now, fif -- well, 10, anyhow, 
who did that first. And then, the day after, I 
re memb er we  sh ou ld  g o  
there and there. We 
had 11 places from where there was -- people wa
s -- boats was sailing from, and we went 
down with it, with th
e people on it. Everything was -- 
the only thing, one of our docto r, 
Doctor Gasfeld, he had sometimes to give an 
injection to children, in
 order to keep them 
quiet, and that was -- 
Q: To make them sleep, or -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0040
 
 
30
 
 
 
 
A: And that was, he said, [indecipherable] th
ing th at he ever have done, because it was 
not his patient, he didn™t know the condition 
and yes -- but he did it, and -- and never 
forget that, there was no losses. All the passe
nger we had, came out. And that, luck -- we 
had the ch urch letters, we had th e hospitals
. When  the day came, you know that i-it was 
leaked by a German, the s -- the Jewish
 society would not believe it. And -- 
Q: You™re talking about at the higher level, th
at a -- a German told a Dane that -- that -- 
that Nazis were going to round up 
all the Jew s in early October. 
A: That was Mr. Dukfitz, he was a member 
of the German litigation. He was a Merchant 
Marine diplomat, and he had -- was told ther
e would be two boats co
ming in  to pick up 
the Jews. Maybe he was okay, infilled by the Dani
sh  civilization, so he told it to -- to two 
Danish politicians and they went to the Jewi
sh societies, to the 
mosiac society to the 
synagogue, they wouldn™t believe it. But when  
they related this news to the fact there had 
been burglaries in the different organi
zation, and th e only thing missing was -- 
Q: Burglaries, in the -- 
A: Burglaries, yeah. And -- And the only th
ing missing was the register of memb ers of 
the synagogue, they  saw it. And th en we have
 the story about Rabbi Milcher going in and 
said, ﬁThey™ll be no service today.ﬂ It was 
ju-just before the new year, the jo -- ho-

hoshonah? 

Q: Rosh anna -- Rosh
a -- Rosh Hashanah. 
A: Rosh  Hashanah. The -- Just
 be -- before that, and -- and there was quite a lot of 
people. So, when the N
azi came, there was no people left. Of course there was -- the -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0040
 
 
31
 
 
 
 
there -- it w as not possible to -- to evacuate th
e Jewish old age home, because it was just 
behind th e synagogue, and the synagogue was 
always guarded  by -- by Gestapo. So  they 
couldn™t bring th ese people out, and it meant th
at when they came, th at morning, and on 
that night, quite a lot of the people fro
m -- from the old age home, were taken and 
brought to -- to Germany. 
Q: I want to ask a few mo re details about 
what you™re assignment was. So, you were at 
home, and this policeman that we™ve me
ntioned, comes and tell -- gives you an 
assignment. Where were you supposed to pick
 up the group of pe
ople? What -- How did 
you pick them up, in a car or walking? And 
did you do it right away? Was this something 
you went and did right aw
ay, or how did it wo rk? 
A: [indecipherable] within one 
hour, they should come, and I we
nt to the station, and they 
came there, and -- 

Q: The train station? 
A: The train station, yes, and I, of course
 asked, ﬁHow shall I know them?ﬂ ﬁYou will 
know them,ﬂ he said. And th
ey came there, and okay, you
 know, very confused. They 
have got the message that -- and then the -- 
th e only guy -- man they saw was a guy 17 
years old, come along. And we went to these 
families and stayed there, because I -- I was 
also -- I would get new orders later. And brou
ght them to the -- to the people there and 
from other stations, Elsinore, Esbeger, Snag er stein, people came, they have got ex -- 

explanatio ns, you go there and there. And th
en the Mr. Chumsen, who [indecipherable] 
see there, he was the man who combined -- in
 two or three days, he combined all the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0040
 
 
32
 
 
 
 
different groups, because many -- 
there was a private fisher, we
 belonged to the resistant 
movement, and so, out of nothi
ng, came a fleet. Really, ther
e were quite a lot of boats 
going o -- further up at the coast, the big fish
er boats, they could take 50 at every trip 
over, and th at was -- but our boat had b
een there before, because that -- that 
[indecipherable] used to -- since the 29
th
 of August, where we shipped sold iers, Danish 
officers, because that™s -- they
 started -- Danish military battalion -- no, that™s regiment, I 
joined that, later on, after co
ming to Sweden. So, it was -- the 
-- we had our boat, and that 
boat was in use all the time, and then a couple
 times, I w as asked to go with a -- if there 
was something very important, and later on, I 
too -- because I was a culear, I had letters 
from -- I don™t know who, but I knew who was the 
receiver in -- in Sw
eden . But, i-in the 
first time, it was so, that the people came up, 
and th ey have been hi
dden, the -- the Jewish 
refugees come up, they have been  hidden
, for instant, in th
e hospital, becau -- 
Q: This was the first time
 you were asked to do it? 
A: No, the first time, no, no. But people 
came from hospitals, they came from ev -- 
anywhere. In hospital, there ar
e always places or rooms where 
they connect the different -
- different parts of the hospital. That was warm
, there w ere -- and they
 had plenty of food, 
and they stayed there fo
r a couple of days, three, four da
ys, and then, for instance, if there 
was a funeral from the hospital, first was the wa
gon with the body -- a
nd there was lots of 
taxis, and they go from the hos
pital to the cemetery, but a car, one on one, ma ke another 
direction, and th at way, they came out of 
the hospital, without being -- it was natural 
there was many cars. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0040
 
 
33
 
 
 
 
Q: Oh, you™re describing how you s
nuck people out of the hospital? 
A: N-Not me. Resistance -- 
Q: Not you, but the resistance mo vement? 
A: Yes. 

Q: Okay . 

A: And that gave the possibility to get up to th
e coast, and that is one of the ways. Other 
ways was by ambulances, they were going up 
there. But, the most came by -- by train. 
And that™s, see, especial in Denmark, we sh
ould not have passport for driving train -- to 
go by train. We had some different -- There 
was a quite different situation in  Denmark. 

We were -- We had mo re freedom, in a way, if you can call that freedom, that you can 
drive a -- a train without a special passport. 
But we co uld do that, and -- and people came 
by th emself, and every time -- Goldberg er -- Professor Goldberg er, he ha -- has been very  

involved in this -- th
is museum, he told that his fath
er was cantor in the -- at th e 
synagogue, had taken out 
his beard, that is -- 
Q: Shaved his beard. 

A: Yeah, shaved his beard -- beard, and that 
is, for him, very, very, very important, but 
when  he was sitting in a train,
 he had tried to find a way to 
get out, and was in the train 
back to -- to Copenhag en, then the -- [indecipherable] ca
me and they said, ﬁOh, hello 
Cantor Ricoff.ﬂ So, but that was -- at the tr
ains, there were no spec
ial guard. And by the 
way, I don™t think th at the mo st of these cr
azy SS men, Gestapo, knew wh at a Jew looked 
like. One thing they wouldn™t understand, th
at anybody would help  a Jew. That was a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0040
 
 
34
 
 
 
 
very big surprise, they though
t, it™s very easy, let them hi
de, w-when -- in no time they 
will come up and we take them
 as sitting ducks. But they didn™t come, and it gave us, 
really, at least one week wh ere 
they just hesitated, and -- and that -- that was a mood in  
the people, they re -- that was 
the first time we -- a li -- for
got a little bit of the shame and 
-- and really thought, okay. That
 -- That was the result of it. 
Q: You were sitting up straighter -- 
A: I™m a little bit proud -- 
Q: -- just now, wh en  you did th at. 

A: -- a little bit proud of it. And -- But, on th
e other side, we had a
ll the luck. In 1943 -- 
no, in 1942, the Norweg ian Jews was taken. 
Swed en did not help , would not help. But in 
1943, after we had el Alemaigne, where Ro
mmel was thrown out of Africa, we had 
Stalingrad. Rome had su rrendered and the ma
ster of the sky was the allied aircrafts. 

There will be no, no risk for Sweden for a German attack. Ge
rmany, or ra -- ja -- Sweden 
accepted to take all Danish refugees in. Rememb er one thing, all Danish refugees. I -- Is 
very important, because we had some not Da
nish Jews, who™d been
 in Denmark, coming 
up from Poland. No t many, but they were ha -- 
ha -- was in the country  the ninth of Ap ril, 
when we were occupied and pa -- they stayed
 there. But that was the cr -- we™ll always 

see that in the -- in the book --

Q: This is a continuation of a United States
 Holocaust Memorial Mu
seum interview with 
Preben Munch Nielsen. This is
 tape numb er two, side B. 
A: And -- Where did we come to? 
Q: You -- You were just talking, I think, 
about the circumstances which had changed, 
which perhaps made this possible. 

A: Yeah, because what happening was that now
 w -- the Swedes gave all Danes free pass 
to Sweden. But we™d ha
d these Jewish -- non-Danish Jews
, but together with quite a lot 
of refugees, came also Danish
 police people. You mu st re
member t h at in 1943, and 
before the war, it was very seldom a Dane ha
d a passport. We could go with out passports 
as -- into Sweden, Norway and Finland, and 
that was normally what was done, that was 
before the ch arter explosion and -- and people
 did not -- I remember 
when my uncle, wh-
who lived in Paris in the 30™s
, came back to Denmark by air, it was in the local papers, 

that -- th-that -- so it w a -- so seld om was it.
 But the Danish police,
 they issue a passport 
to most all the refugees, and when a girl, 
Jewish, from Poland, non-Danish resident, she 
got a Danish passport. That way, she was un
der the promise from si
 -- from Sweden, that 
all Danes were able to come in, and she tells
 it -- about it in -- in my  book. So  -- But, 
again, the whole situation 
in Ochabol was very uncerta
in, a -- but also, there was 

something, I don™t know, who saved -- there 
was -- as a Christian, I can say a guardian 

angel. We had the time, we had th e warning,
 we had th e church, and out of nowhere, 
there was a fleet of boats, and that is, to 
me a sign of something, I don™t know, but the 
meaning was that there should be no Holo caust in there. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0040
 
 
36
 
 
 
 
Q: I wonder if you co uld tell -- tell me a few mo re
 details. I want to fi-finish the story that 
you -- you were told by the policeman, one 
ev ening without warn ing. You went to the 
train station, you recognized th e group of pe
ople, the group of Jews coming. What did -- 
Tell me where you to ok them. And presumably
, you hadn™t had a chance to call your 
neighbors and say you we
re coming by, so tell me how that worked. 
A: They have already been 
in contact with the policemen
, and that was no -- that was 
later on, when more came -- more refugees cam
e than expected, that we just went to the 
next door, and it was never denied . Co me in and 
let™s -- We never took 
more than three in 
-- we have seen in at -- a 
little town, north of Elsinore, 
Gilleleje, where 80 people was 
taken on the church loft, and that was because of a girl who was dating a German soldier, 
talked, because of ignorance. 
And then Gestapo came and to ok these 80 people. And th at 
was the most that were taken, and just lik
e the -- together with the people from the old 
age home, the greatest number. So far, I rememb
er about 600 were sent to Germany, and 
60 died. None of them came -- of the [indeci
pherable] came to Au
schwitz. And I really 
think that -- that™s also very important, th
at we had no governme
nt, but we had that 
administration. And then, they got to go to 
Red Cross -- Danish Red 
Cross, the possibility 
to visit Auschwit -- no, Theresienstadt.They knew it will be used -- misused in 

propaganda. The Danish part of Theresiensta
dt was painted, they got dressed up with 

plants outside, but of course, the prisoner wa
s not allowed to speak 
alone with -- with the 
delegation coming down from Denmark, but they
 should speak togeth
er with a German 
officer, and the only language, of course, Ge
rman, was allowed. Bu t this delegation had 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0040
 
 
37
 
 
 
 
two very important -- very important results. 
The first, that it was allowed to send gift 
parcels to t h e prisoners. That was some va
 -- why someone send clot
hes, some food, not 
much, but just that was give th e different for starving to deat
h and just starve. They sent 
school books to the children, so they could 
have some formal education down there. The 
next, and the mo st important then, was that none
 of the Danish prisone
r should be sent to 
Auschwitz, or the other extermination camps. 
And the German kept it. And just before 
the war was over, I think it was March or Ap
ril, ™45, the white buses came and took -- 
that was the Danish resistant movement, wh
o demanded that it was not only the Danish 
resistant movement people who should be br
ought back from Buchen
wald, or what -- the 
other name, but also the Jews in Theresiensta
dt, so they came home be
fore the war, not to 
Denmark, they had -- they was not allowed to
 be there, to Sweden. And from Sweden 
they returned, in ™45, in Ju
ly, I suppose. A-A-A month or two after the war, and they 
come back to thei
r homes, and -- 
Q: Th-Th-This week that all of the activity
™s going on and -- and yo
u™re very busy, did 
you stop going to school that week, and tell --
 and were you wo rk ing pretty much all the 
time? H-H-How many people did 
you pick up, would you estim
ate, in -- or maybe how 
many trips did you make? 
A: I -- I -- I can™t recall. I -- That was a 24 
hours job. Of course, picking up from the 
station, that was only until 11 - 12
 o™clock. There were no trains
 pa -- in the night, but to 
bring them round, to -- and then maybe sup -- 
go down  to the beach 
and wi -- cause now, 
there™ll be -- there™ll be a transport possibility
. That was -- And that™s
 the first time my 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0040
 
 
38
 
 
 
 
grandma smelled there was something. But at th
at time, one of my  cu -- my  oldest cousin, 
he went to  America already, in ™39, and he 
was in the American Air Force. And my -- He 
was also [indecipherable
] my cousin. He flew -- He was re
fugee in, oh that was in ™43, in 
beginning of ™43. And then, in end of ™43, 
I had to go to Sw eden , because of the -- 
something happened  in  Denmark, some were a
rrested, and then I had 
to stay. But, that 
was, of course, pretty much the job, and -- 
but the worse thing was,
 when s -- when the 
refugees had tried to hide themselves in th
e wood. And then we we
re young people, who 
knew every path. We knew exactly  wh ere wo
uld you hide if you 
-- and -- and -- but it 
took longer time to get them. And th-they 
were afraid un -- beca --   in that 
[indecipherable] in that way that we were 
speaking Danish to each other. So -- And the 
refugees could not understand wh
at we would, that no Germ
an soldier dared to go into 
wood. They walked together two or three, bu
t through a wood? No, no,
 no, no. It was too 
dangerous, no lights, no nothing. No. Wh en  
they have seen, often 
before, that was the 
way the Danish resistant movement had so me of their weapons, by knocking two sold iers 
down and taking their rifles. So -- But, in
 a way it was -- when a 
-- I look back, it was 
without any excitement. That was -- I unders
tand the refugees, how it mu st be awful, 
awful, awful. But I -- All the things we ha
ve, and now the view of life and death in -- 
during a war. We accustomed to death. When  
you hear about Stalin
grad, 400,000 killed, 
the millions, they [indecipherable] after the 
war, we really understood that six million 
Jews, so and so many Gypsies, and 10 million Russians was killed by Stalin, and -- but 
that was, in a way -- let me say I -- I though
t we did a good job. I was satisfied that we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0040
 
 
39
 
 
 
 
have done it, and when we 
waved goodbye to -- i-in a wa
y, have we fulfilled what 
Eichmann would have? To remo ve the Jews fr
om the Danish bot? Isn™t that completely 
ironic? That, in a way, Hitler had a result. 
But, there was one thing that is more 
important. They came back, an
d th ey were welcome back. 
Q: In your years, did you ever come across 
someone who recognized  you and said, ﬁYou 
took me over on a boat.ﬂ 
A: The only [indecipherable] 
is my wife™s maid. They gr
aduate together, no. We -- 
Q: Tell that story, tell that story. 
A: Yes, that™s -- We w ere here in New York
 some years ago, and -- here at the mu seum, 
and then  we were asked if we knew any Da
nish Jews living in  America, and Sonia had 
the girlfriend, th -- they graduate together, 
and she came -- ask her to gi -- if they had 
some material, artifacts, to the museum, and 
they did. And then we
 came in and talked 
about it and she have been over 
in our boat, in the boat. So, 
at the meeting here, after the 
mu seum was opened, about Denmark and the 
rescue, she could tell about th e boat up 

here. She came over, and I could tell how it wa
s to have that boat, and -- but that was 

only a-an -- she was, of course, a little girl 
at that time, an d -- 10 years old, maybe -- may 
-- no younger, eight years. And I-I-I can™t recall a
ll that, and she couldn™t, of course not. 
But, it was a job who was  done secretly
. You did notice [indecipherable]. The less 
people knew, the better. And qu
ite a lot of the thing was in
 darkness. Remember, it was 
ju -- we have black -- what you call black-o
ut, we -- it was not allowed to show lights 
from the houses, and wh en we 
went from the houses, down to  the beach, it was through 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0040
 
 
40
 
 
 
 
these passe s. We knew, so we can go on scen
e from there, where th
ey have stayed, the 
shelter, and down to -- to the beach. So -- An
d the mo st of the people were thinking of 
anything else. Why, that was the last part, which they thought was the most dangerous 
part. What I think was, I couldn™t ag-agree 
that wa -- w-we never discuss it, but unsure -- 
we were never hundred percent su re, out ther
e, we could see the enemy. So -- But -- But 
mo st of -- of the people never m-met again. 
It was -- You must reca
ll that from Denmark 
to Sweden came totall
y, over 20,000 refugees, from re
sistant movement, the searchers 
from Germa -- German army. Only one-third of 
all the -- the refugees w-was Jewish. Yes. 
Q: Essentially, at some  mo ment
, you were a refugee, correct? 
A: Yes, it happened so that later th is year, 
when the refugees -- not more were Jewish, I 
continued to -- to work in th
is way, that I was a career. 
I got from -- still from my school 
-- 

Q: A courier. 
A: Yeah, courier. I -- From -- Came, got some 
letters to deliver in Sweden, because we 
have the route, I was in charge to  do th at, 
and one day, I was told wh en they  come over 
from our liaison officer, Mr. Pallum, the -- th e 
Ger -- Swedish policeman, that I couldn™t 
go back because some thing had -- some had be
en arrested and -- and well, I was 17 years 
old, so I maybe thought that it was too da
ngerous, so I went to school in Sweden, 
graduated. I have a Swedish family. 
Q: Where did you live? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0040
 
 
41
 
 
 
 
A: In Lindsherding. That™s in wi -- it™s, oh 
well, if -- 300 kilometers north  of -- of the -- 
where we -- we have our -- at Helsinbor, th
 -- 300 kilo meters. And I graduated and from 
there I went directly into the Da
nish brigad e, and was a soldier. 
Q: Tell us a little bit about the Danish brigad e.
 You™ve mentioned that, but I wasn™t as -- 
sure what that was, because -- ar
e you saying it existed in Sweden? 
A: It was so that after the 29
th
 of August, in ™43, the Danish
 gen -- staff -- general staff, 
sent some Danish officer to 
Sweden, in order to, if it was possible, to make a regiment 
over there, because most part of the ref
ugees was from resistant movement, and they 
wanted to do something, and there were 
military force built up 
with the Sweden™s 
acknowledgement, and paid by the Danes, 
of course, and under command of General 
Jewingeres, and British general, we were s-st
r [indecipherable] to se
rve to the six army. 
No, the eight army , under ja -- Montgomery. And we were supposed to be -- to land in 
Denmark, if there was -- and wh en  -- an invasion on the Danish. 
Q: So you were training to  
be a real ground troop? 
A: [indecipherable]. Yes, we ha -- we ha d really commander training, it was very hard, 
but still we have that -- we had a purpose. We 
had really that idea to 
come back and fight. 
To have the sin from the ninth of April away
. But -- And in that, of course, there were 
many Jews. Young Jews. 

Q: [indecipherable] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0040
 
 
42
 
 
 
 
A: Yes, of course. They were Danish citizens.
 So that was the same
 -- you si -- you see, 
that™s also maybe the difference. No -- No, th
at™s not difference, because quite a lot of 
Jews were really wonderful German 
soldiers in the first World War. 
Q: And the Polish. 
A: The Polish, too, yes. So, th
eir loss. So we -- I started ther
e, just after I graduated, and 
was -- I think it was end of March from ™44, a
nd we returned back in the fifth of May, 
1945.  

Q: Were you hoping that 
you would be able to go wh
ile the war was still on? 
A: Hope to do what?  
Q: To fight. 
A: Well, that was the purpose. Later on, that
 was strange enough, because we only had 
very small fights with the Germans, and I su
ppose we lost 10 or 15 men, or something 
like that. But we were a little bit disappointed. 
We -- It w a -- Again, luck. I -- I -- I don™t 
know how we shall d-describe, 
not only the Jews situation,
 but oth -- the other Danish 
situation. That was something that kept em
 from the disaster.  When
 you came  back to 
Denmark, it has not towns ruined
 by bombs. We -- We had the 
possibility to -- to live, we 
-- so it -- i-it was something very strange. Not a 
rich country, but not a poor country, not a 
destroyed country. And it™s a 
country wh ich not had an  inte
rnal fight between left and 
right. And we were so lucky that the Russian
 invasion stopped before our border. Only 

one place, on one of the isle
s, Bornholm, it was bombed, 
because a German commandant 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0040
 
 
43
 
 
 
 
would not surrender, then 
they were bombed by Ru ssi
ans. And the Russian took 
Bornholm, and stayed there 
for so and so long time. 
Q: Describe how you 
got back to Denmark. When  
were you told  that you sh ould 
mobilize? How did you get over
 with your brigade? And -- An
d perhaps even when you 
actually got off the boat, how did yo
ur -- your fellow citizens react? 
A: Well, we were mobilized long time, beca
use from [indecipherable] after the Odenna 
offensive of -- in -- of pard -- Ch ristma s, ™44,
 we were in red ale-alert, always should be 
no distance from -- fro m our weapons. Then we 
were brought down, transported to our 
camp in south of Swed en. And then, in the ni
ght and I can tell you that Denmark was an 
ixtas, the fourth of May, that it was sa
id on BBC. The German troops in Ho lland, 
north west Germany and Denmark, has surrende
red. And we stood there, of course, 
happy. But then, during 
the night, we went to Helsinbor, we
nt into -- to a fisher boat com 
-- [indecipherable] over, a small -- Maritimco ta
 from the fleet, and later on, the ferries 
was used, and we came into Elsi
n-Elsinore and families standing
 there, and crying. It was 
wonderful.  
Q: Did you know an yone in the crowd? 
A: Oh, th at was my hometown, yes. After 10 
minutes, I was in my own hou -- home, just 
for five minutes, to say hello. 
Q: What did your grandmother say to you? 

A: Welcome home. Oh, wa -- It w as -- It was a day.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0040
 
 
44
 
 
 
 
Q: And then , you said you just
 had five minutes. Wha-What was your assignment, where 
did you have to go off to? 
A: Oh well, we should -- we ha
d two assignments. First of all, our -- we were an infantry 
battalion, we went down to the boat line betw
een Germany and Denmark. We have to see 
that the Germans came out of Denmark in or
der, and not stealing too mu ch. And we did 
that for -- until July month. We had anot
her -- We have some pioneers -- engineer 
soldiers, and they sh ould be in command of ge
tting th e mine fields clean. And that was, 
of course, the German soldiers who -- wh
o did the Du tch job, but our men was so 
[indecipherable] 

Q: You kept the German soldiers so that 
they could help you 
sweep for the mines? 
A: Yeah. I know that is not quite doing the Ge
neva co-committee, but well, they have put 
it down, let them take it up. So -- But w-we -- That was a really smooth affair down in -- 
in -- in -- in their borderline. There was only 
few accidents. Some German soldiers tried -
- that was SS soldiers, tried to go behind the 
lines, because they knew 
that they will be in 
special camps, and we caught so
me of them, but the most th
ey -- old men, to me. They 
came there, going with their bask
ets and there no fu ture, they couldn™t see anything. That 
was not the -- the very strong army we have se
en Hitler, that -- what he did to  his own, 
that is remarkable. But 
they followed him.

Q: This is a continuation of a United States
 Holocaust Memorial Mu
seum interview with 
Preben Munch Nielsen. This is 
tape number three, side A. 
Before we move on too much 
into the post war era, I wanted
 to  ask this question, and y
ou™ve certainly touched on it 
many times, but why do you think the rescue of 
Jews, fellow citizens, but they were Jews, 
was so successful in -- in your coun
try? Why do you th ink that was so? 
A: It was obviously  the only wa
y we can do it, the only way 
we could live. That™s, as I 
said before, 20,000 refugees, Da
nish refugees was in -- in 
Sweden, one-third was Jewish. 
Whether you™re -- Whether Dane, Jewish or n
on-Jewish, thas would 
be the same . We had 
to do everything we could to save Danes fro
m the fate, to  go to a concentration camp. We 
knew about the concentration camps
 in 1943, not the -- the whol
e truth, but we knew that 
these people will live in agony, I -- we nee -- 
they had to live in hu
miliation, they were 
starve -- you couldn™t do th at. And especially 
not the Jews, because th
ey were absolutely 
innocent. There was very few Jews in the Da nish resistant movement, because that was 
an agreement, that we wouldn™t have -- we 
wouldn™t know, the people who decide that -- 
that because of a Jew was caugh
t, we should see a Crystal ni
ght in Denmark. We couldn™t 
have that. One of my good fri
ends, [indecipherable] Israel, he
 lives in Israel now, he was 
one of the guys who to ok -- broke in -- in
 the synagogue, and took all the silver. The 
Torah scrolls, they were all hidden in a Dani sh church, rememb er that, all hidden there. 

But -- There was quite a lot, a
nd they were afraid. And he was one of the few members of 
the -- the resistant movement, and together with
 other Danes, he took the silver, send it to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0040
 
 
46
 
 
 
 
the comma nding ch ief of the German troops in 
-- up in  Narveek. It came, because then 
would it go to Elsinore. And in Elsinore, it 
was taken by the resistant movement, and -- 
and -- and -- and hidden ti -- until the war. The 
synagogue was not touch by the Germans. 
This -- The Jewish prisoners interationta wa
s not sent to Auschwitz. Why? Because SS, 
Gestapo, the Germans, have seen how we r
eacted. And we were -- Denmark were rather 
important as distributor of food to Germany.  And it mean, if they did something, it will 
be closed. The Danish railway sabotag e was qua
 -- rather good. At 
the same time, they 
were building up the west la -- la -- the la
nsing line, or wh at, west wall what do you call 
it? And it was so much sabotaged in Denmar
k, by putting sugar in the concrete, and it 

wouldn™t harden. You know that? And they  have
 seen -- they have se
en the result that -- 
but they  never would have belie
ved, helps the Jews. They mu st  have been comp letely out 
of their mind. 
Q: Do you ever think, or have 
you thought, or discussed this 
with anyone, that if -- if in 
other situations, in other countries, if there 
had been  a similar kind of organized -- well, a 
similar kind of resistance, let™s say, and an a
ttemp t to save Jews, that things could have 
been different in other countries?  
A: First of all, that was -- that is not right
, with organization. The success was b ecause it 
was not organized. It was private -- I mean, 
here and there, but of course, later, and 
during th e time, it was organized. What I re
ally mean is that if the Pope had done 
something in the 30™s, maybe th
e situa-situation have been di
fferent. To me, a situation -- 
I -- I am proud that the only church who rea
lly condemned, was the Danish church. That -

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0040
 
 
47
 
 
 
 
- And it was not just wo rds, because many re
fugee found a shelter in the vicary, and 
many Danish priests were in connection with 
the resistant movement, and that way, were 
helping the refugees to Sweden
, send them ta -- send them to 
-- to other people who was -
- but natu rally, if there have been con -- pe
ople have condemned this, but who want to 
help a Jew? 

Q: You™ve talked a lot in this  interview, mentioned that -- 
the feeling of shame, of not 
doing enough, and th en a -- and th en how that
 -- that feeling shifted, wh en people -- 
Danish people began to do so
 much. In the -- In the era after the war, I -- I wonder if you 
could talk about that, the Danish  people came
 out of the war feeling that really, you had 
behaved, you had done the ri
ght thing. Many people have come out of the war feeling 
maybe that they didn™t make good choices, an
d as -- I -- I read a quote that the Danes did 
not lose their souls during the time of Hitler. 
And I just wonder if you have any thoughts 
on that, I mean, whether -- whether you disagree 
with it, or -- or if it sparks any other 
thoughts? 

A: I never gave it a -- a thought, because we
 come -- we came back and we have been 
involved all the time, a
nd I know that it was, as I said, 
with my  grandmother™s blessing. I 
think the main thought in Denmark, oh, God be
 praised. We had a very cheap travel. And 
-- But we learned from it. Denmark went into
 NATO. Today we are in Kosovo. We -- I 
learned --  to me for -- for 
instance, that the eur -- eur 
-- European union is very 
important, I z -- have worked for -- and th
e  European movement for 35 years or 
something. That was -- NATO 
and that Euro pean movement was in order to avoid war. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0040
 
 
48
 
 
 
 
We have seen the war, and in the -- the years 
after the war, we saw the casualties, we saw 
the million, we saw the result, we saw the 
con -- the concentration camps and -- and if 
continued in -- in the Soviet Union, wher
e a gulag -- where Sta
lin killed even more 
people than Hitler. But, I thought, naïve as I 
was, that unity in Eu
rope could 
make us a 
better continent. And I really think we have achi
eved quite a lot 
in that way. I really think 
that for the first time in history, there™s 
not being a war in  50 years between central 
European states. We h ave, of course, now down 
at the Balkan, but we have not have this 
war between England, France and Germany. 
England an-and -- and France, to be the 
master of Europe. We have ha
d this union which -- and my  idea of a -- a union is what 
Charles DeGaulle said, a Europe of the Fath
erlands. We are Danes, we are French, but 
we are European s, but we are not going to  be
 directed from Brussels. We have our own 
parliament, but we have so many common inte
rests. We have the 
now -- which Denmark, 
not are in yet, the eril -- the economy, but we
 will have it [indecipherable] in some years, 
we will also be member of the European -- ha
ve the Euro as our cu
rrency. And I really 
look forward to that. 
But the question that we
 should have been pr
oud of ourself now, I 
really think there was, in Denm
ark, very much self criticis
m of the way we behaved, the 
government, the -- the wo
rk . Th ey w o rk ed  too  mu
ch together with th
e -- with the German 
authorities, but on the other side
, we did not lose ourself, that™s right. The -- I was not less 
Danes when I returned than 
before, I really think that. 
W-We had a much easier time 
during th e war than mo st part
. Only Sweden had it better. Y
eah, they -- that -- so -- and 
after the war, I really think that we have ma
de very, very  big prog
resses. We -- And the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0040
 
 
49
 
 
 
 
situation between the nations in Europe is mu
ch better than it was before, and so we have 
learned by the war, f-for Denmark 
to go into NATO, that™s okay.
 That™s just like to make 
a garden on the inlands eyes of -- yes, becau
se we -- It™s so long
 time we were a wild 
Viking nation, we still remembered. 
Q: You™ve mentioned Koso vo once or twice, a
nd I just ge -- like to get you to so rt of 

elaborate a little bit on that, and I must remi
nd people listening to this, that it™s April 16
th
, 
1999. It™s about two weeks into
 a very -- a very fierce bo
mb ing of Ko sovo and of -- of 
Serb -- Serbian forces, by NATO
. So, I would just like you 
to tell us a little bit more 
about wh at you think ab out the decision to do that, and -- and why y-you think it™s 
important or not important. 
A: I said before what would happen if, in 
1936, we had seen the French attack the 
German -- the Nazi German troops. Maybe million of people™s life 
have been spared. 
Every time we stand against a 
dictator, you will see that he
 do whatever he want, and 
blame always his enemy for what is done. No
w, that was the only way out. We had, in 
order to still live up to what we are taught, th
at we are our brother™s keeper, we must 
attack people who deny other peoples thei
r freedom. And I can™t see it co-could have 
been done another way. Maybe 
I -- I -- I will not talk about sending in today, ground 
troops. What happenedtoday is that a fanatic man d
ec-decide hundred of thousand 
people™s fate. It™s -- It -- He
 is really a dictator, he™s re
ally danger -- dangerous ag ainst 
the -- the world society, and to me it™s qu
ite clear when you see the only people who 
support him, is the former --
 people from the former Soviet Union, and Ch ina, and both 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0040

of these countries have severe problems 
when it comes to human rights. And human 
rights is one of the thing we mu t -- we ca
nnot adjust them. We cannot say that human 
rights is for Christian, not for Muslims. So I 
really think that™s it. G o  without saying, we 
have to fight against 
what I call the evil. 
Q: The what? 
A: The evil. 
Q: I™m going to sort of go 
back a little bit. I w o nder if
 you can tell us
 anything you 
remember right after the war, about trials of
 collaborators. And I know th at there were 
some i-in -- in your country.  

A: Well, I was against these trials, because 
the collaborators who was taken, was a small 
fish. And because of the -- the punishment they 
got, the lowest punishment for four years, 
all the small, easy cases, they 
got four years. But, wh en th
e big cases, where the real 
criminals came up, oh well, then the softhear
ted Dane has said, that was too much. The 
people who got the four years, they served
 their time. The others, they got maybe two 
years, three years, and nothing hap -- and we
 had, of course, the sev ere examples, the 
killers, the informers, and -- an
d some of them were shot. 
They deserved that, but the 
whole s-system of laws we had, first of all,
 it was against Danish morality to have a law 
which punished things what has happene
d already. You cannot have a law going 
backwards.  

Q: They had to enact ne
w legislature for this? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0040
 
 
51
 
 
 
 
A: [indecipherable] l-l-l-legislatio n, but th-t
heir excuse was that the Council of Freedom, 
in ™43, had said, if that and that are done, it™
s an offense, and it will be punished after the 
war. But, it was not a government, it was -- that
 had no power but okay, the main ideas in 
-- in the law was exactly what the Council 
of Freedom has said, but the Council of 
Freedom had not included this small, unimpor
tant guys, they would have the criminals, 
they would have really crimi -- the people wh
o broke our law, who was traitors, but that 
was a small, comp letely inno -- not innocen t,  but ignorant people 
who was punish ed out, 
and that was -- and then, if you were lucky a
nd first were taken prisoner three years after 
the war, and have done serious crimes, we w
ould not have the death penalty. Children, be 
at five, six, seven years, and well, that wa
s wrong done. The idea wa
s right, of course you 
sc -- you have to be punished fo r thing you 
do, but it was done in the wrong way. They 

hit the wrong people. 

Q: What -- What about in your town, or Elsi
nore, wh at happened  to
 the -- there weren™t 
as many, but wh at happened  to the handful of collaborators there? 

A: Oh, they were arrested, but 
wha -- I must say, I™m ash amed 
of one thing. Quite a lot of 
the girls who dating German soldiers, ti -- th
ey were captured and they cut  all then 
painted swastika on the ma -- I -- I was very ups
et when I saw that, and that -- that was, 
to me that™s -- that™s a shame 
on -- on th e people who did it, I 
--   was very brave to cut -- 
take the hair off a girl, that™s -- no, but 
it normally was people who never had done a 
single thing during the war. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0040
 
 
52
 
 
 
 
Q: The people who were -- who were looking 
for revenge, had ne -- I™m not sure what 
you said. 
A: I said that the pe -- the people who -- 
who did that, never did 
a single thing until the 
war, they were -- they just find out how -- th
at was funny, that was -- okay, that was 
people of the street, and I™m very much asha
med of that. But it happ
ened in all towns all 
over Denmark that wrong people was taken pr
isoner, and wrong th ing was done to -- to -- 
to women. 
Q: So what do you think was going on
 there? Wh-Why did that happen? 
A: Because of the ligisation. First of all, b ecause the Council of Freedom wanted to avoid 
the Night of the Long Knife, as 
we had in other countries, where -- 
Q: The night? 
A: Of the long knives. Wher
e, in France, for instance, 
where many was killed when the 
liberation came. Also private 
problems was taken [indeciphe
rable], then telling this is 
because of -- of the war, he is 
killed or she is killed, he ha
d done so and so. That was -- 
Therefore, the Council of Freedom wanted to 
have law, so the people who did something 
wrong, should be punished, bu
t not private, this would be 
by the official authorities. And 
we did th at -- we did that. The only thing was 
when the judges of the street, and that went 

the wrong way for quite a lot of -- of -- of the 
girls. S -- I don™t like what they  did, I think 
that was completely wrong, they
 -- but punishment, not that way,
 not that way. That is the 
-- the jury of the streets, we
 -- we can™t have that, not in a society wh-wh-who wants to 
have law and order.

Q: How long were you active in th
e brigade, after the war was over? 
A: Oh, fo r two months, about two 
months. We were dismissed the 10
th
 of July. 
Q: Okay , and what did you do then ? 
A: Well, when I -- Just enjoyed life. For more
 than a month, I just went around looking 
good friends up and meeting girlfriends, and 
living a life, and -- and then, in end of 
August, the hard wo rk started, I started 
studying, I went through -- I went to the 
mercantile, and -- 

Q: The Mercantile? 

A: Yes, I ha -- me rchant high school. Then , 
it took th ree, four years, and in the meantime 
I got married, and -- 

Q: Tell us -- Tell us a little bit about your wife. 

A: My first wife. 

Q: Your first wife. 
A: Nice girl, and we met, by the way, in
 the summer of love, summer of freedom, 
summer of everything. The summer the 
sun was up 24 hours 
a day. So we 
[indecipherable] you know. It was out of th is 
world. That was -- And well, many of these 
[indecipherable] coming 
the first years was maybe a little 
bit too early for us. And then 
my -- the last year at school, at university th
ere, I started in my father-in-law™s company 
and stayed there until ™81, long time after we 
have been divorced, and that -- that made a 
rather quick way out of the ri -- w as many direction, by now I was 28, and -- 
Q: What kind of company was it? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0040
 
 
54
 
 
 
 
A: We are selling chemicals, we are selling pr
oducts for paint and varnish, plastic and all 
this industrious, and medical. And in -- in 
1960, I ki -- had my  divorce. We had three -- 
three children, a boy and tw o girls, and he is 
now a -- well, is -- is an
 old guy now, and he 
is, of all places, in the re -- what do you call 
it, taxation? He™s a lawyer, and they sit there 
and -- but ki -- he is a very, ve
ry  k een  civ il se
rvant. So -- B-But that™s
 not my  way of life. 
But w-we -- w-we -- I see him tw o or three or 
four times a month, he lives not -- not so 
far away. And th en two daughters, one is a te
acher, and the other is studying, now it™s art 
[indecipherable] studying all their life, and ha
d a wonderful time. And th ey live both in 
Copenhagen, in the same -- s-sa
me apartment house as my form
er wife. They bought that 
-- They bought that some years ago, and th
ey -- they are living,
 and they are both 
divorced, my  daughters, I hope, 
soon, because I want to have
 mo re ch -- grandchildren 
then. And then in ™60, I suppose, ™61, I marri
ed Sonia and we have three sons. The oldest 
is now main director in our company. [indeci
pherable] son is director and been work ing 
since ™81. And then  a son who™s a journalist,
 he has been  here, and who™ll -- who™ll be 
back in May, to New York . A
nd then the youngest who has ju
st been in onwha -- enwise 
-- enwi --  
Q: NYU? 
A: NYU. Started on a film course, he wants to
 be a film maker. And we live in Esbagere, 
very near to wh ere I was born, and we 
have the -- the -- a good reason to go to  
Washington once a year, and we -- I™m making qu
ite a lot of speeches now, in America, 
and that™s very good.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0040
 
 
55
 
 
 
 
Q: I want to ask about the speeches and why 
you come here, but be
fore, do your children 
know a lot of your history 
and wha -- and what 
you did during th e war, and if so, when  
did you tell them about it? 
A: As I told you, this is not a issue in 
Denmark. When  we are talking about what 
happened during the wa r, the -- we will always have this -- our debt, was it the first or the 

second World War? That is not an issue, be
cause how could we beha
ve in an other way? 
That™s -- Th -- My children, wh
en they see -- for instance wh
en  the groups of Jews are 
coming to Denmark, are telling that and that, 
they -- they can™t understand it. Why? Wh-
What could you have done else? So that™s -- that
™s not an issue in -- in
 -- in our speech, in 
our home.  
End of Tape Three, Side A 
Beginning Tape Three, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of a United States
 Holo caust Memorial Mu
seum interview with 
Preben Munch Nielsen. This is 
tape number three, side B. 
Can you talk a 
little bit about 
when  you first began maki
ng speeches about this? 
A: Oh that™s -- I really think 
that™s about the time with the -- 
with the boat, when -- ™89, I 
suppose it was, that Professor Leo Goldberg er
 asked me to find a boat. We have been 
together somewhere and -- and then he -- he 
asked me to find, and then I make -- and 
there was an interview in one 
of our papers, and th e day afte
r, the boat is here. And that™s 
the boat, you know, and that was fantastic. 
A nd then -- And then, 
the boat it built oak on 
oak, and it was from pre-war, and you don™t find 
them very often, be
cause they were -- it 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0040
 
 
56
 
 
 
 
took quite a lot to make it clear every yea
r, for the season, so -- but the -- the guy who 
had it now was the third owner of the boat in
 this -- almost 50 years. So it was -- And 
then -- 
Q: Let me just clarify something. You™ve 
mentioned Professor Goldberger before, he™s 
Danish? 

A: He™s a Danish. His father was cantor of the synagogue in -- 
Q: Okay, that™s right. 
A: -- in -- in Copenhagen. 

Q: So, he is involved
 with the mu seum, and -- and he 
contacted you and said, ﬁI -- We 
would like to find th is boa
t,ﬂ and he sort of gave it to you as a job? 
A: Yes. Not the boat, but a boat. 

Q: A boat. 

A: A boat, and we found th e -- this boat and my
 surprise that it was our boat, was minst -- 
that has been placed for 50 years,
 for all the years, in Elsinor
e, and I have boats in that 
same harbor for many, many years. 

Q: And you didn™t know that -- 
A: No, no, no, no. Because it 
was changed a little bit. The 
-- And the -- th-the name was 
quite different, and that is, you see, el -- in 
-- in Elsinore port there, the marina, that™s 
1200 boats, so you can™t -- can ™t see the -- know them all. 
Q: How -- How did you search for 
the boat? Tell me what you did. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0040
 
 
57
 
 
 
 
A: Oh, well I just was interviewed and as
ked if anybody knew about a -- a b -- a boat 
from -- from the October ™43, and then he came
 with it and said, ﬁI bought that from 
Tormul Larsen,ﬂ so it was so 
-- so easy to -- to go back 
and find the real thing, and 
[inaudible].  We had some wonderful pictures
 the day it was taken up from the harbor and 

put on the truck for -- dispatch
ed thing to -- to Baltimore,
 I suppose it was, yes.  
Q: Okay. Do you rememb
er when you found th is particular
 boat and you actually went to 
see it? Can -- Can you reme mb er back wh
at it was like to walk back on it? 

A: It was wonderful, because when I saw it fi
rst, oh it was ugly, it™s ugly. And -- But then 
I saw the captain, and there was one thing di
fferent, because there was another engine, 
and that engine was bigger than  the engine that
 was in the boat befo
re. And, but also the 
same thing. You could -- Y
ou couldn™t remember. And Tormul Larsen, who was the -- 
the man who owned it after the war, said 
he had many good hour
s in that boat. 
Q: Did he -- Did you get a 
chance to go out on it? 
A: Yes, [indecipherable]. But only on the last
 -- the last trip from 
-- from -- down to the 
harbor wh ere it was put on the truck, and sent
 to -- to America. And then I saw it in 
Baltimore, because we had very
, very keen discussions abou
t the color, because the paint 
that was used on the boat in 
that time, was made of fish oil. We hadn™t -- We had no 
mineral oil to do it, so it was 
fish oil who was -- that was th
e -- the main part of it. And 
that was fine to -- to find th
e -- it was gray, in order -- and 
non-reflecting, you know, not -
- no gl -- [indecipherab le] shoul
d be non-reflecting the light, 
in order to have it mo re 
hidden, when they were sailing, as
 they go, one wi-with the water.

Q: And so it -- Was it brought 
here on a ship, in a container? 
A: In a container, on a ship. 
Q: Okay . 
A: Yeah. Bu t that was not our business, beca
use we di -- it was delivered on the pier.  
Q: Can you tell us a little bit about -- about
 wh en you speak. You said you do it quite 
often now. What do you find people are inte
rested in when they
 hear you speak?  
A: First of all, si -- I must say that what
 I™m speaking of, is 
why Ho lo caust failed in 
Denmark. We are try to give th e historical pe
rspective, to give a
ll the good thing which 
happen, with -- with the dates,
 the time. It was in ™43. W
ith the help from the German, 
with the -- the position in De
nmark that everybody would help a Jew, that it was not 

something uniqued. I want to give that forwar
d, and th en, the question is, of course, how 

did you do it, and all th
is and -- and I try to  te -- also, in humor that there™s been very  
funny times. For instance, some
 of the -- the refugees, they
 had to  stay, because they 
couldn™t move the pe -- move the hospitals
. And then a nurse asked the -- the -- the 
doctor, ﬁWhat disease shall we write on the ch
art here?ﬂ ﬁOh, call it German measles.ﬂ 

You see, that™s -- that™s typical Danish, typica
l Danish, that if we can have a little bit of 
joke, a little bit fun, and also to take the -- th
e atmosphere. These people lay in their beds, 
had maybe a depression, they were afraid 
and all. And then, call it G erman measles. 
They-- It gives a better atmosphere. So -- And 
then th ey asked the story ab out the king 
and the -- the -- the yellow sta
r. And then, the -- always says
, why was they not arrested? 
Well, because, as I say, nobody of these guys
, knew a Jew. They had to ca -- th -- from

the gossip papers and all this. And also try to 
tell that -- that w-we -- we had food enough 
in Denmark, we -- it was not under same cont
ro l and th at it was not an organization. It 
was many, many different people who tried to
 help and okay, there mu st have been a 
guard ian angel in one way or another, wh
ether you believe in angels or not.  
Q: I wonder if you co uld talk a little bit about
, because I think this is in your first 
interview, and i-i-it™s just in speaking to y
ou again, you™re clearlyasked over and over, 
why did you do this, why did th e Danish peop
le help the Jews? And you -- you, over and 
over, try to convey why you did 
it, but you™re also trying to convey  a kind of disbelief, 
almost, that you get asked this all the 
time. A lmost like a frustration, and -- 
A: No. 

Q: No, not -- But I thi -- But 
I think it™s very telling, ab 
-- it i -- it™s telling of who you 
are.  

A: Well, I really think that what we did was 
a matter of decency. Could I have been able 
to look and see myself in th
e mirror if I had turned my 
back? It was in ™43, we knew 
about the concentration camps, we knew that 
we had the possibility. We knew that these 
people were innocen t people. I think that™s -- 
that™s mo tivation, mu st be valued, also for 
the people who ask. It™s enough for me. 
I don™t think we made something unique. I will 
never be able to live a -- a country where you
™re a hero because you give a helping hand 
to a fellow citizen. Or unique be-b
ecause you act in a decent wa
y. You see, that™s -- that™s 
the whole thing that my belief -- that™s wh
y I™m not for democrac -- lif -- I™m not for 
dictatorship. I want to be demo cratic, but I 
cannot eat oysters and drink champagne if my

next door neighbor starve. I cannot enjoy my  
freedom when  my  next door neighbor, an  -- 
because of nothing, because of 
innocent work, are punished, beca
use he -- he is a Jew. It 
shouldn™t be a crime. And we 
-- And we cannot accept that. And therefore, I -- I really 
find that it was just a matter of decency. And th
at is why we don™t talk about, that™s not 
issue. That my children, 
they would have hated me, 
if I had done nothing. 
Q: H-Ho w do you make sense of the fact, t
hough, that so many other people do? That 
they want to applaud you fo r wh at you do, th
at they do single you 
out, that they do talk 
about it? I mean, how do you make sense of that? 
A: I™ll have to answer with a joke. Once 
there was a man who came to me and said, 
ﬁWhy are you always so happy?ﬂ And [indeciphe
rable] say, ﬁOkay, in the mo rning, I s-
stand up, go out, shave me, a
nd see me in the -- in the mirro
r.ﬂ ﬁI do the same,ﬂ he said. 
And then  I ask, ﬁYes, but you 
don™t see me in the mirror.ﬂ  
Q: Let me see, h-how did your initial interv
iew with th e mu seum come about in 1989? D-
Do you know who recommended, or di
d you offer to do an interview? 
A: No, no, no, no, I was asked to
 -- to do it, and because we ha
ve been on L Street there, 
several times, and because I was involved  in
 the boat. And -- And maybe Leo Goldberg er 
have said I should -- could give some -- so
me views on this. And to
day, because I™m the 
only surv ivor of the -- of the rescuer, not only, but you know. 

Q: Almo st only. 

A: Uh-huh. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0040

Q: Y-You co me frequently, and you™ve particip
ated in a celebration 
at a s -- a synagogue 
nearby. I wonder if you can te
ll us a little bit about that. 
A: They have a -- They call it 
a Garden of Righteous, and ev
ery year they honor a person 
who have helped the Jews. And I was honore
d some years ago, and I can mention th at 
Professor Kaska is one and Frau  Welnber anot
her, so I™m in a very wonderful company. 
So -- Bu t I find that a very beautiful day an d 
we meet quite a lot of the good friends we 
have here in Washington area, 
and we love to be here. And one thing mo re, it™s at the 
right time. You see, time means something.
 We come here and have spring two weeks 
before we have it in Denmark, and we long fo r spring, after gray, very dull winter, to land 
in the airport here, 20 degrees Celsius, go 
down and see green trees, lots of flowers 
blooming [indecipherab le]. That™s wonderful. 
Q: What do you think of the current -- the 
last few years there™s bis -- perhaps an 
intensified interest in -- in the Holocaust. 
There have been  documentaries, and of course, 
the movie ﬁSchindler™s List,ﬂ which won many
 awards. A-A-Ha -- Wh
at do you think of 
all of that? D-Do  you th ink there is a genuine
 interest, or is it perhaps maybe just a kind 
of a fad, or how do you make sense of it? 
A: It™s very difficult, because we have se
en, after the war, many th
ing which goes near 
Holo caust. We see it today in Kosovo, we saw 
it at Rwanda some years ago. We see it in 
Sudan, Muslims again Christian, we see that in
 India. We see that in the former Soviet 

Union. I think th at it™s also
 the interest in -- in avoi
ding -- avoiding a new Ho locaust. 
Therefore, I -- when I participate, many times, it 
i -- a part of an Ho locaust education, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0040
 
 
62
 
 
 
 
I really think that the Holocaust education ma
ybe can give us some answers how to avoid 
it. I mean, education is one of the things, 
when you see round the 
world, people living 
next to each other in different countries, th
ey believe the other country will do that and 
that and vice-a - versa. And they  fear it, 
they don™t know. The mo re
 we™re able to know 
about our neighbor countries -- neighbor countri
es, it will help. I don™t believe that we are 
able to make countries love each other, but co
uld we, through education, make them hate 
a little less, we would had achieved quite a lo
t. But, I think it™s so important, with the 
Holo caust education, and a part of the Holo ca
ust education is also ﬁSchindler™s List.ﬂ 
Last year here, we watch a preview of a picture about the Danish  rescue of the Jews, and 
it was not so special, truthful, but it was a good story, and -- but it gives the impression 
all the time, that we can do so
mething. Not to avoid it, but 
to dimin-diminish the results 
of it. We -- We must do something, we must 
learn people to do what we, as Christian or 

Jews, are taught. That we are our
 brothers and sisters keeper. 
If we live up to that, I really  
think that it will be a much easier wa
y to live, and a more lucky world.  
Q: How -- What is the situation in your country
 now, with Jews? Is -- Is it similar, has it 
shifted in any way? Have you ever seen 
a period where there was some anti-Semitism? 
A: Never. I can tell you, last time there was 
anti-Semitism in Denmark, was in i -- 1813. 

And there was something unique, 
because th -- that -- this year, 1813, the Jews got full 
Danish citizenships and were allowed to trad
e on the exchange. And some of the Dane -- 
other Danish -- non-Jewish merchants there,
 were very annoyed 
about that. And they 
hired some people to beat the Jews. And some
 of the Jews were beaten badly. But, the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0040
 
 
63
 
 
 
 
king made an action. The pe
ople who was hired was jailed
, and th e merchant who paid 
them was fined very hard. Si
nce that day there have been  no anti-Semitism in Denmark. 
And I -- There won™t be ba -- for instance, we
 have lots of literature in Denmark written 
by Jews, but all in Danish. In other country, y-
you will see, in Yiddish or in -- in Hebrew, 
but the Danish -- by accident Jewish, authors, 
write in Danish. They™re a -- an important 
part of our literature. And therefore, the Je
ws are not something different. They are not 
living in ghettos, they can be your next doo
r neighbor. They are -- During the war, during 
the occupation, one of the chefs of the depart
ment of Social Affai
r, was a Jew. Today, y-
y-you don™t -- y-y-y-y -- that is -- that is 
not a question to put because why should there 
be? 

Q: Well, in preparing for this interview, I did 
read one thing that right after that war, that 
there was a -- a few situations of anti-Semitism 
and that people attributed it to the Nazis 
had sown  some seeds, and -- and then it -- it 
kind of was pushed away  again, but that -- 
that it was hard right after the war, and so
me people were grumbling and saying, oh, 
everything™s the Jews fault. This I read, but 
I think that it, the source of it was Rabbi 
Melchior. And he said that it was very short-
lived, but that it -- it --
 there was just that 
moment, and I -- so I was curious about that. 

A: Well, normal -- normally I quite agree 
wi -- I don™t know th e -- we have several 
Melchior. The -- The rabbi who 
said in the synagogue in ™4 3, was the other -- that was 
Marcus Melchior, and his -- hi -- that he wr
ote, ﬁThat was a Golden Heart,ﬂ when he 
returned. And th e other, Ben Melchior, he just 
retired last year, and I haven™t seen that, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0040

about that, but maybe something 
I have overlooked, but today,
 th at™s nothing, nothing. I -
- Because everything we were against, as 
a n ation, was nascism, an d I will be very 
unhappy to believe that
 one of the mo st nasty things 
with nascism, should have been 
survived id -- in Denm
ark. I think that™s -- No, well I 
-- I can™t -- I can™t understand it. 
Q: H-How -- How is what you did and many
, many others of Danes, how is that 
commemor ated in your country? 

A: Not at all. 
Q: Not at all. 

A: Why should it? Why should it?
 We have our Friends of the So und. We meet once or 
tw-twice a year, and we have our tradition. 

Q: Oh, Friends of the Sound is
 your -- re-really, your -- the group that did all this work 
with the rescues and the boats, or -- 

A: No, no, no, that -- that is -- that 
is a -- a union of all this who did. 
Q: Okay . 

A: Because ha -- Elsinore™s Sewing Club is 
one, and -- but the Frie
nds of the Sound was 
founded by t -- Mr. Thompson, 
he was an innkeeper and he died in  concen tration camp . 
Q: And what do you do when you 
meet? The Friends of the So und. 
A: What I do? 

Q: What -- Wh-What -- What do
es the group do when  it meets? 
A: Having a yearly what do you call it, yearly
 meeting. We are a society and we have 
election about who shall be the chairman, and on
 the very, very high 
level. And then we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0040
 
 
65
 
 
 
 
have a good dinner, and we
 have some songs and -- and we are stil l , the few of us, still 
able to drink a beer or two. We -- But we ha
ve a -- that™s a reunion every year and that™s 
in -- that™s really nice, but 
it is hard to be the presiden
t, with less and less members. 
Q: And just one last question. A-A-As peop
le who really remember the experience pass 
on, do you have any --
 how do you think your -- what
 you did will be remembered? I 
mean, how will it be rememb
ered correctly, as you w
ould have liked it to be? 
A: That -- That was a bunch of people, beca
use there was many women in it, who act in 
the only way you can act, if you want to be a 
decent person, and nothing mo re. Because it 
mu st not, if we want to avoid Ho locaust, be he
roes or unique who do 
that. No, that should 
be the normal man, because he can avoid -- th
e hero cannot but maybe save a couple o-or 
two, but that mu st be the normal man who 
understand it™s possible to avoid, without 
being a hero, because we are not Rambos or 
Schwartzenegger, or VanDamme or what. It 
-- To avoid Holo caust is, you will have to us
e the normal person. And I -- If I sh all be 
remembered, it™s that I did a reas -- a decent
 thing and that was not mo re what you can 
demand of everybody. Still reme
mbering you are your brother™s
 keep er. There we are. 
Q: Thank you very much. 
A: You™re welcome.
