Interview with Edith Palkowitz

A: I Œ I have to tell you the whole story, because m y story doesn™t make sense, with 
m y answers. So, I have to tell you how I don™t know things, and why I don™t know 

things.  

Q: Oka y. 

A: All right? 
Q: Oka y. 
A: So, the first thing I remember, I was four years old, and I found myself in a 

place, the snow was higher than I was. A lot of people cryi ng, cryi ng, tearing of the 

clothes, and a big commotion. And nobody pays attention to me. When we left, I 

said to somebody, where are we? What is this place? And the y sai d, this is a 

cemetery, and we just buried your mother. I was four years old. I was told she died 

from a brain tumor, on the operating table. So m y f Œ we get home, when I stay with 
m y grandmother, and my father moved in, and we were t he three of us, because 
Grandpa died just before. And was a very difficult life, because m y mother was so 

young, and m y grandmother couldn™t take t he pain, and the sorrow, to lose 
a young 

daughter like that. So, we covered by rel Œ Jewish religi on, we cover the mirrors 

when someone dies, and we did cover it, and after 30 days you™re supposed to take 

it off, but she never took it off. As m y Œ as long as I remember, the mirrors were 

covered. So, being that I had no one to take care of me, m y Aunt 
Ella
 hired a 

 
Interview with Edith Palkowitz  
 
August 26, 2016

governess, whose namewas 
Mimi
.  So
 Mi mi
 took care of me since I was four years 
old, til right after the war. And we did everyt hing together, schoolwork, fun work. 
She taught me lots of etiquette; she felt it was very important. She taught me how to 

boil eggs warm water, i n case. 
[indeciphera bl e]
 in case of what? Everything is 
good to know. Everythi ng is good to know. I was ironing, I was washing, cause she 
did tell me all these things. And I was very content, she was very, very good to me. 
And couldn™t be happier, except the house where I lived with Grandma, it was 
a 

very sad house. And I Œ the children didn™t want to play with me, because I was 

always sad. And Œ and this is how the years went by. And I went to school, and 

when in 1944, 
Mimi
 wanted to leave. And we didn™t understand why 
Mimi
 want s 
to leave. And she said t hat in her home, there is a catastrophe, and she has to leave. 

Doesn™t matter how much she loves me, she has to leave. So that was an indicati on 
that some political change is going through. But of course the news was handled 
through the government, and fa Œ also the radio. There wasn™t any tel evision or 

anyt hing, l ike toda y. So, in a quiet, buzzing way, we heard that the German army 

took over 
Czechosl ovakia
, 
Romania
, ot her parts of 
Hungary
, 
Poland
,
 France
, all 
the eastern European countries. And we heard this stuff, and it was very surprising, 

because we don™t know this stuff, we don™t know these things. Could I have a drink 

of water, please?

Q: So you said you were Œ over the radio, and newspaper, you were hearing little 
bits and pieces about what was happening outside Œ 

A: Right.  

Q: Œ the Germans, you know, their activity. And s
o you 
Œ and then you were about 
to tell us about your governess, 
Mimi
, leaving. 
A: 
Mimi
 left, went back to
 Switzerland
, and so it was m y grandmot her, and my 
aunt didn™t live wit h us, but m y father remarried, three years before. 
Q: So, in 1941. 

A: Right. The y married a very nice person, and the y had the child together. Her 

name was 
Susa n
, 
Susan
. The y wanted me to l ive with them, and I wanted to live 
with them, because I was tired of the old at mosphere, and the sadness, and the 

covered mirrors, and all that. But my grandmother wouldn™t allow it. She sa ys, 
you™re m y only contact  to m y daughter, and I™m not letting you go. 
Q:Sobecause you were your mother™sonly chil
d, she wanted to keep you there. 

A: And she stated it wi th so much common sense, that nobody was arguing about it. 

So I stayed with my grandmother, and contact ed m y stepsister once in a while. Very 

Œ you know, it Œ and then in three years the y were together only Œ 
onl y three years, 
and then became 1944. And so that day, t hat big da y came, when t anks, and military 

machines, and guns, and unbelievable attack on every house. The y just shoot. They

were shooting without aiming. They just were shooting. And then 
a young man, a 
German fellow, soldier, came in yelling and yelling and pushing. Broke down the 

front door, and he said, 
schnell
, 
schnell
, that means hurry, hurry. And I had what I 
had on, not  special clothes or anyt hing. I just grab my pocketbook, and Œ 
an
d for Œ 
for i-identification, and Œ and Œ and a little jacket, that™s all.  
Q: And up until t his point, had your life in 
Budapest
 been pretty normal? 

A: Yes.  

Q: Nothing had changed, there weren™t any restrictions? 

A: No, no. Some t hing Œ restrictions were in the schools. The y di dn™t have religious 

classes, so the y combined the Christian classes with the Jewish cl asses. However, 

they didn™t make us to kne Œ 
knee down 
Œ kneel down, or any other t hings. So we 
sat in the back, and we just sat there. 
And our bui
lding had three flights. One Œ two 
staircases. One was for the residents, and one was for the delivery and maintenance. 
And he keeps on pushi ng me, the soldier, and I™m going t o where I al ways go, t o the 

resident s-staircase. And he starts to hit me with the Œ wit h the rifle back, and you 

lousy ge Œ Jew, you don™t deserve to be on the Œ on that staircase. You go where the 

delivery is, where Œ where the maintenance m en are. And he was very upset. And I 

turned around, went  over there, and he started to hit me. I lost three or four teeth Œ 

moving teeth, was loose. And he kicked me down from the third floor, spiral Œ 

 
Interview with Edith Palkowitz  
 
August 26, 2016

spiral staircase, to t he bottom. So I had lot of bleeding. I cut m y head. And he Œ 
th
-
the order was to meet downstairs. When someone was inj ured, you stay here, one Œ 
were you able to walk, you stay here. So my aunt was very worried that I Œ I have 
too much blood on me. So where Œ 
why 
Œ where they gonna put me? So she licked 

off the blood, and she swallowed it . I really don™t know if you could comprehend 
what that means, to lick off my ni ece™s bl ood, and swallow it. And she cleaned me 
out, so I was return on the cl Œ on the oka y people. The not well people were shot 

right away, right front of me. Neighbors, students, friends, teachers, t hey were shot 

right there, front of me.  

Q: All people you knew. 

A: Who were Œ lived in the house, and people I know. St orekeepers I sold Œ I went 

to. And I j ust looked, I looked. And then 
Ella
 says, what you looking? Stay with me 
now. I said, why? Because. And t hen on the loudspeaker came, everybody goes to a 

stadium, and there™s someone gonna lead you, and stay in the line, and go to the 

stadium. Stadium was six miles awa y. You could just physically i magine me, whose 

mouth was cut, or head was cut, walking with m y grandmother, six miles away. It 

sounds not so specificall y bad, but in actuality, to put yourself physicall y in this 

situation is Œ is Œ is unreal that Œ that someone ask you to do thi s, but don™t forget, 

we were the healthy ones. 

 
Interview with Edith Palkowitz

Q: And it™s mar Œ March, right? 
A: March. March. 

Q: So there is Œ is there still snow out, and it™s Œ 

A: It™s March, cold, snow, and wet. And we went 
[indeciphera ble]
 in the morning, 
10 o™clock, and finally, finally we got to the st adium. 
Q: And had Œ 
had other 
Œ did Œ ha Œ did you have to march through the city of 
Buda pest 
Œ 
A: Yes.  

Q: Œ to get there? So what Œ did you notice the reactions of people in town, as the y 

saw all these people being marched? 

A: It was a wide lane, you know, it™s not  just two or three. So, I really couldn™t se
e 

on th Œ where Œ what they do 
there, where 
Œ 
I heard, 
there Œ good for them, that™s 
what the y deserve, t hat ™s what they deserve, good for them. 

Q: This is what people are yelling at? 

A: Yelling at. And it was just Œ after shooting all these people, it was just such a 

bad, bad feeling I had. I really didn™t care what did they say to me at t his point. So, 

getting to t he stadium was a miracl e, a miracl e by itself. Was about one or two 

o™clock, I don™t know how long. And there were benches, and we sat in the 10
th
 
row, 12 row, I don™t know, and they said t he first row, second row, 
threed
 row Œ 

 
Interview with Edith Palkowitz  
 
August 26, 2016 
 
 
 
14
 
third row, fourth row, go down to the bus, and the y take you to your destination. No 
one would ask where is our destination, where are we going. No one. I was hungry 

already, and I was tired, but nothi ng. After, we found out that those buses took you 

to Œ to 
Auschwitz
, and to all the camp, but we didn™t know it then. So my 
Ella
 
sa ys 
to me, you know, it™s already four o™clock, can™t go on forever. Let™s go all the wa y 
up, because the lower l anes moving. Let™s go all the wa y up. So we went all the wa y 
up, and Œ and she was right. And t hen there was a young Hungarian soldier, a young 

boy, who used to be her newspaper boy. And she was very good to him all the ti me. 

And she called over the boy. Now, how did she trust that boy, I have no clue. 

You™re doing things which Œ which you don™t  know the risk you™re t aking. You 

don™t need t he risk you™re taking. She called him over, she sa ys, woul d you walk us 

out of the stadium? We will come back tomorrow. And t he boy did. So, he took us 
out, an Œ to the Œ outside the we Œ stadium. And you know, it™s about evening, it 
gets dark early, and now what? But God gave us good C hristian people. That 

Christian people, Mrs. 
Mo na
(ph),  
was my aunt™s 
cl
ient. She had t he store like bed 
and bath, bedding and the t-towels, and this ki nd of a stores. 

Q: Oh, like ho Œ 
Home Goods
.  
A: 
Home Goods
. And she did very elegant work, wa Œ which included 

monogramming. And she had the very fancy clients, the y had the crowns, and t wo Œ 

 
Interview with Edith Palkowitz  
 
August 26, 2016 
 
 
 
15
 
two legs on the crown t old you who you are, three legs on the crown told you who 
yo
u are. So this Mrs. 
Mo na
(ph), we Œ a year before this all started, came into t he 
store, and she said Œ very religious woman, very religious Christ ian woman. She 

says, I love you both, but 
Edith
, I want to give you a cross, and it™s bl essed by the 

Holy Mot her, and 
Ella
, I want to give you a cross. You know, not thi Œ I™m not 
disrespectful, but I didn™t know what holy water is, holy cross, I don™t know, I 

didn™t know, I was 13 years old then, when she gave it to me. 

Q: She gave you each a crucifix? 

A: Yes, no. 

Q: Oh, just a cross necklace?  

A: Yes.  

Q: Little like medal lion, or Œ 
A: And the Œ 
yeah, yes, yes, yes. Andthat 
Œ no, a cr Œ a cross. 
Q: A cross. 
A: Yeah. I still have it. So I forgot about i t, took a pocketbook before I left to that 

stadium. And so we went to Mrs. 
Mo na
(ph), and she cleaned us up. I™ve a Œ and 
then, in bi g signs, if you help any Jew, wit hout any trial, you™ll be shot. No excuses, 

no discussions. So we didn™t want to sta y wit h her, because we were afraid of Œ for 

 
Interview with Edith Palkowitz  
 
August 26, 2016

her life. And then t he news came out that t he y™re selling t ickets to a safe house, 
which is managed by the Vatican, and a Vatican flag flies over it. 

Q: In 
Budapest
? 

A: In 
Budapest
. Y
ou know, that™s all we knew. I mean, how you Œ how you fi Œ 

figured it out, is it true, is it not, what did it mean. So m y 
Ella
, she could afford it, 
she had mone y wit h her, so she bought for the three of us, two tick Œ three tickets, 

and we went there. It™s a two bedroom apartment, about 40 peopl e. Every night I 

felt urine in m y mouth, because there was only t wo bathroom for 40 people. But  

looking outside the window, we were still happier to be there, than outside. And 

then came the big surprise, that the ticket was only good for 14 da ys. And now, 

what do we then do now? So as we went downstairs, at the door, the Germans were 

waiting for us, and put us in the ghetto. And then in the ghetto, we were put in the 
worst apart ment, and every day we were marching outside. I had the hole in m y 
shoes, put in newspaper, and by one o™clock 
[i ndeciphera ble]
 got wet, and melted 
from the snow. And very, very degrading person I became. Degradi ng person who 

everybody loved, and 
Mimi
 loved, and had everything i n the world, and now I™m 
walking on the street, and some idiot throwing a Œ a pox on me, and cursing and 

whatnot. Who are these people? I don™t know. I mean, it™s a different neighborhood, 

a different zip code, I™d never been there before. And then, I felt that I don™t want  to 

 
Interview with Edith Palkowitz  
 
August 26, 2016 
 
 
 
17
 
do this any more. So I said to her Œ oh, Grandma went to Mrs. 
Mo na
(ph), and she Œ 
she was hi ding there. She had the basement , and she wouldn™t let her go. My 
grandmother. 

Q: So your grandmother was still at Miss 
Mona
™
s
? 

A: Yes.  
Q: But you and your aunt go to the safe house? 
A: Yes.  

Q:You™re separated at this point.
 
A: Right. And then 
Ella
 and I was in the ghetto. And I said to 
Ella
, I said, look, 

let™s get out of the Œ the Œ the lane. I mean, they™re not going to kill us. Oh 
E dith
, 

please hone y, of course, the y™re gonna kill us. She called me 
Chirpy
, that was m y 
nickname, 
Chirpy
.  
Q: 
Chirpy
?  
A: Yes. And it™s a very warm name, you know, it™s a very loving name. And she 

says, 
Chirpy
, this is crazy what you™re thinki ng. 
Ella
, I™m not going to stay here, 
and be here six, seven, eight mont hs. I mean, I Œ I Œ I Œ 
I wenton to
 nothing. And 

we didn™t eat, and we didn™t trust anyone to Œ t o talk to, because if people told about 

other people, hoping to get extra food. 

Q: So you Œ you didn™t know who to trust . 

 
Interview with Edith Palkowitz  
 
August 26, 2016 
 
 
 
18
 
A: No ca Œ no one to trust. So I walked like on the side of the line, already get back 
in the line, get back in the line. So, in the 10
th
, 11
th
 month, one da y I walk with 
Ella
, 
and I™m talking to her. I said, listen 
Ella
, I™ll go out there, you don™t have to. But 

this is terri ble, this is reall y not something that I Œ we don™t know how long it™s 

gonna be. In the meanti me we had t he Œ heard about the Polish reso Œ revolution, 
that they killed the underground people, and Œ and Œ and i t was terribl e. 
Q: Oh, the Œ the 
Warsaw 
uprising. 
A: Right.  

Q: So you were hearing bits and pieces from 
[indeciphera ble]
 
A: Right, right. She sa ys Œ and then I said, why don™t you answer me, why don™t 

you answer me? And she is nowhere. Somebody pulled her out of the lane, and I 

can
™t find her. So, I was all by m yself, and I think that was my worst day, when I 
lost everything; all the confident, all the hope, all the Œ all the attention, everything. 

I lost everyt hing. So I went back t o Œ upstairs to live, and in a couple of days, I 

walked out of the line. And the soldier comes to me, what  the hell  are you doing? 

Wit h the big rifle. I didn™t say anyt hing. He said, let me see your papers. 

Q: Was thi s a German, or a Hungarian soldier? 

A: A German. 

Q: A German soldi er. 

 
Interview with Edith Palkowitz  
 
August 26, 2016 
 
 
 
19
 
A: German. And I spoke fluentl y German, remember? But I couldn™t say a word, 
the words didn™t come out. What shall I sa y? He holds t he rifle, and he sa ys, give 

me your identification paper. And I actually, effectivel y started to shake, and I 

dropped my bag, and t he cross fell out, what Mrs.
 Marti n
 gave me. And he sai d, 

just go. And I feel this is a miracle. I feel that it™s a miracle that the cross fell out. It 
was about six, seven o™clock already. So I wanted to go t o Mrs. 
Mo na
(ph), I didn™t 
know exactly where she lived, and Œ and Œ  and I didn™t had money. So I remember 
taking buses, and trains, and whatnot. And I told the bus driver I™m a student, and I 

lost all m y money. He says, that™s all right. He didn™t know I was Jewish. And then 

there was a fruit store, and I said to the owner, do you have any fruit which you 

can™t sell, which is damaged, because I™m very hungry. So he went i n the back, and 

he brought me out some fruit, and it was wonderful, because I was very hungry. So 
finall y I found Mrs.

Mona

person, how could I do that to her? So, a friend of a friend of a friend recommended 
me to be a mother™s helper. So I left Mrs. 
Mona
(ph) after three da ys, and then Œ this 
was end of already finish Œ al most finished, everything. I went t o this lady, she had 

four children, and she was thrilled to have me. Which mother is not happy to have a 

mother™s helper, you know? And she lived on a 10 flight house. And she said, oh, 
I™m so happy with you. Everything was fine. However, as it was the tail end of it 
already, the l ast months, in April 1945, that™s when the liberation was. And the 

Germans, and the R ussians and the Hungarians fought a staircase, the f Œ the Œ the 

elevation, t he f  Œ third floor, fourth floor, fifth floor, all different soldiers. I didn™t  

know which is which because the y all wore the boots, and the y al l had rifles. I 

didn™t know which sol dier was 
[indecipherable]
 but they didn™t bother us, the y 
were just fighting. For one floor the y fought like two da ys.  
Q: And so this was Œ 
A: To take over the floor. 

Q: So it™s during the Œ t he Siege of 
Budapest 
Œ 
A: Right.  

Q: Œ that t his is happening.  

A: Right, right. 

Q: So it™s right in your building. 

 
Interview with Edith Palkowitz

A: Right.  
Q: Wow.
 
A: Yes. And we went on to the downstairs, to t he basement , and that was equipped 

with the ki tchen appliances, refrigerator and food. And t he y call it bunker, bunker. 

And we sometimes slept there, too. But t here wasn™t much of a ti me, there was Œ in 
the meanti me, was no food at all. So the Œ they took horses, whi ch one was shot 
before Œ there was no man, every man was in the army Œ women took the horse, 

sliced it up and made the stew out of  it, or a soup out of it. And when I heard it, I 

went like this, you know? And th-the woman says, a rough woman, she says, if you 

hungry enough, you gonna eat it. And I was hungry enough to eat it. 

Q: These were horses that had been shot that Œ 

A: Right.  
Q: Œ somebody found, and Œ 
A: Was si-sitting on the street, lyi ng on the street. 

Q: Right i n front of the building? 

A: Right in front of the building. And I asked Mrs. 
Mona
(ph) when I got there, 

where™s 
Ell a
? And she said, she™s trying t o hide, by friends. She had a lot of friends, 

because she had the store, you know? She knew a lot of people. Well, I was there 

two months, at the Œ at this person, and then the Russians came in and shot all the

Germans, and told them to go to ru Œ you comi ng with us to 
Russia
. But there were 
no Germans any more, they were the Russi ans now. And the Hungarians were 
arrested, too. So the Russians said, we help you Jews. Somehow, nobody believed 

them. The y didn™t do anything for us
. We werefreezing.
 The y had Œ didn™t give us 

any food. So, they said, now you are free to go wherever you want to. But the 
problem was, we di dn™t  have the strength t o go anywhere. We had no place to go. 
Every house looks like a Œ a toy house, full of holes, full of holes, just  like the 

people were damaged, shot, to the 
[indeciphera ble]
. And then, about three da ys 
later, the English soldiers came to liberate. And then, we felt free. Every soldier 

took two, t hree people, and only took care of those two or three peopl e. And 

blanket, and food, and t ea, and Œ and Œ and for the head. April is a rough month, it™s 

very windy, and cold, and the Œ that™s when we were free, that™s when we were 
liberated, in April 1945. Can we pause now? 
Q: Sure, let™s take a Œ a quick break. 
[break]
 
A: After the English people came in, and the soldiers, we were really free to go, and 

Œ and before we™re able to leave, the y had to st raighten us up a litt le bit, out. I mean, 

the strength, the Œ the blankets, the food, and t he kind words, and where you want 

us to take you. The house, I will tell you about that that after this, because it has i ts 

own story.

Q: Please.  
A: So, we come in back to a apart ment, not to the same apart ment, with Grandma, 

and 
Ella
.  

Q: So the y both came out of hiding? 

A: Yes.  
Q: And you were able t o reunite wi th them? 
A: Right, all two of them. 
Ella
™
s 
husband was taken to hard labor camp. 
Q: So he Œ  he was called up for forced labor. 

A: Yes, for forced labor, yeah. 

Q: Do you remember what year? 

A: About Œ let me see t hat, 1945, 1944. 1944. A year before. So, we started to be Œ 
was Œ was nothing open, there wasn™t a store open. Peddlers sol d fruit and 
vegetables and oil, and eggs, whatever is absol utely necessary, but  wasn™t enough. 
So  
Ella
 and I went out to the railroad, and said, let™s go to the Œ 
because her 
Œ she 

embroidered all her stuff. So that Œ embroidery comes from smal l town, far away, 

small, little bit back, left town, you know. A li ttle education, and whatever. So, she 

felt that if we go to those ladies who work for her, the y have some supply. So we go 

out one da y, is no room on the train. We go out the second day, is no room on the 

train. And t hat kept  on going, and then see, there™s somebody sitt ing on the top of 

 
Interview with Edith Palkowitz  
 
August 26, 2016 
 
 
 
24
 
the train. So what do you do? You go on the top of the train. How do you go on top 
of the train? You take a rope, and you tie yourself on top of the train. About two 

hours of ride. And you don™t move, you don™t breathe, you don™t anything, just hold 

onto the rope. 

Q: So in order to get to the small t own where your aunt had busi ness contacts Œ 
A: Right.  
Q: Œ you had to go up to the top of the cars. 
A: Because there™s no room in the train. Everybody had t he same idea. So we went 

there, to these people, and the y were very graci ous, and Œ I mean, t he y were 

working with 
Ella
 20, 25, 
30 years
, it™s not a Œ a s Œ a short relationship. Ant the y 

packed us up flour, eggs, oil, I don™t know what else, in big bag. Not bags, in sacks. 

So you think that was hard to go out to Œ on the train going there, but to bring this 
stuff with us Œ so we put everything on top of the train, tied it down, and bring it 
with us. And it Œ it worked, it worked. You know, like I was with the horse food, I 

would never think I eat it, never, ever. And I ate it, and you know what, I enjoyed it. 

When you were
 hungry enough, you eat it. Anyway, so we were trying to 

recuperate our lives, schools were closed, and people came back, and Œ from the 

concentration camps, and it was a situation which coming back from hell, because it 

was hell. The y were like 60 pounds, 70 pounds, and he kept us in. I onl y came back

people came, and wi th their hands, the y dug up the rocks and everyt hing, in the 
hope that they feel some of their relatives. So t he Jewish people build a tree there, 
and I™d like you to take a picture of it late-later. And every leaf represents a person. 

Hundreds and thousands of leaves. It was terrible, and the magnit ude of people 

came back, t he y didn™t Œ 
nobody handled us.I mean,the 
Œ the English people help 
us with food, whatever, but what can the y do? And the months went by, t he years 

went by, and about three years later, I decided to leave 
H ung a ry

Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And going back now to the li beration, after three years Œ and everyt hing was 

twice as hard for me to take because my Œ m y childhood. Who le Œ lost Œ losing a 
mo

I ask Grandma, how come Mother left Œ Momm y left, and she sa ys Œ and I said t o 
her, didn™t she like me, did I do something bad? And she sa ys, oh no, she loved you, 

but she had to go. Not t hat she wanted to go, but she had to go. Of course, later Œ 

later years I understood what she said, but it was very hard to comprehend at the 

time. And going back now, after three years of liberation, I wanted to leave. But 

you can™t leave

a time to have an abscessed tooth, how can you figure that? How Œ what are the 

chances? But you had no money, of course, and he sa ys, I take care of you. And he 

took care of me wit hout mone y. So I go t o the immigration, face to face to the 
person who handled my case, and he said, you™re all right. And t hen said, wait a

they put us in a Œ i n a broken down ship. Took three weeks to get there, and I was 

right away i n the Œ in t he hospital. Nobody came in. There was a Russian lady 

brought me food, out of her Œ good of her heart. Cause she couldn™t talk, she felt 

sorry for me. So she came with food. I asked t he doctor, what shall I do? There™s no 

doctor there

me up and t ook me upstairs. He sa ys, look, that™s the Lady of Liberty. Holding me 
like this. Very happy, you know. Very few ti mes I cried of happiness in m y life, but 

that was the ti me when I cried of happiness. So we went t o 
Ellis Island
. And t he 

reason we went to 
Ellis Island
, becausethat™s a 
Œ a spy ship I came with, some 
Russian spy ship. And the y took it apart completely. I was three mont hs in 
Ellis 
Island
, so was everybody else. And the y ask question. But you know, 
Ellis Island
 
looked like the 
Ritz Carlton
, you know, t o me, because nobody bothered me, 

everybody was nice to me, and the only thing I didn™t like when t he y closed the 

sliding doors, you know, the prison doors. But everything else was fine. 

Q: So what Œ what was it like sta yi ng Œ 
you j
ust Œ 
A: The y had questi ons, and they said, were you aware of that Œ that it ™s a sky Œ 
spy 
ship? I said, I wasn™t ever aware of anything, I was in the hospit al the whole time. 
Could you 
Œ could you verify this? I said, how can I verify i t? If you have that the 
ger Œ Russian lady, says 90 percent the y were Russians. So, do you know the lady™s 
name? You know how she looks? I says, I know how she looks, but I don™t know 

her name. Anywa y, so they let us go after three we Œ months. It™s a long ti me, three 

months, but it was okay. Very tiresome for me to talk about this, but I really want to 

do it. Then I came t o the 
Bronx
, in 
New York
, to a Œ 
a 
Œ a far relation, a cousin 
removed couple of ti mes. So she took me in her wings Œ under her wings. And she

had one bedroom, and t he living room was a pull out couch, and that™s where I 
slept. And she sa ys, you know how to sew, you have to go to a factory, where you 

make mone y. So I went to a dress shop, I made fairl y enough, I paid m y rent there, 

was five dollars. And she cooked for me. And the boss of the store di dn™t pa y, he 

went bankrupt. It was not a union place. You know, it™s amazing where I took the 
strength, where I took t he hope, after all thi s sl apping in the Œ on the face, you 
know? I mean, how much Œ how much can you take? I was 19 years old. How much 

can you take? So I went to another shop, which was very successful. I was there for 

10 years. On a Hungari an New Year celebration, I met the young man. His name 

was 
Sam Palkowitz
, and he was a refugee too, but he was in this country already 

couple years. He went to school to get his accountant 
CPA

worked in a delicatessen, and so he finance his Œ 
hi mselfwiththe money he made 
in the delicatessen. And after two years, we got married. He alwa ys said I married 
hi m because he was legal here, that he had t he green card. It™s not true. Is not true. 

But I told 
[indeciphera ble]
 oh m y God, you know? It wasn™t oh m y God, but I 
didn™t have better offers. And so we were married, everything was fine, we had t wo 

children, and then

very nicely. And we were fine. My son

and m y daughter has her own real estate business. The y al l very successful, because 

I pushed them to no end. And I al wa ys sai d Œ and I™m saying on a public speaking, 

that knowledge is power. That™s what it says on 
42
nd
 Street, in the l ibrary, and it ™s 
true. That™s the only thi ng no one can take i t away from you. Everyt hing else goes. 
And the y listened t o me. And then the kids grew up, the y went to college, and 
whatever. And I thi nk getting from m y bi rth, t o getting t o 
America
, t hat™s my st ory. 
Lot of obstacles, lot of painful episodes, but that was the cards dealt to me. So, we 

could go on to 
America
 now, but  I said most of it, anyway. I don™t want to go i nto
 

America
, because I just said it, but I want  to speak about my father. 

Q: Yes, I wanted to ask what was happening with hi m, and your ste Œ  

A: There was an announcement, that who is between 25 and 45 years of age, go to 
somewhere, a

shot. So, we didn™t know what, m y father was 37, 38, and he went  there, and the y 
took hi m to 
Kiev
. On t he Œ on the 30 degree cold Œ minus 30 degree, the y made all 

of them, not only my father, work. Their work was to build a bridge, and the next 

day the y 
Œ t he y blew up the bridge Œ the bridge. The y used them as mined Œ you

months, and my father stepped on one of the mines, and took off one half of his leg. 

So he was taken to the hospital. And then, that happened again, at t he tail end. And 

then the Ger mans pushed back the Œ the Russians pushed back the Germans, and the 
Germans had to leave, and before they left, they poured gasoline on t he hospital, 
and burned it down. And this is not the hearsay, because the Red Cross had notified 

us.

A: Yes. Now, my Œ m y Aunt

the house, t o that house where I showed you, and he said, 
Emo ry
(ph) has to go to 
[indecipherable]
 m y uncle has to go, but the father could be saved, if you write 

over the deed to me, the house deed. It was as quiet as now here. What do you do? 

So my uncle said, listen, alive is more than a house, and he wrote over the deed to 

the soldier. About a hal f a mile awa y, before the ink dried, they shot my grandpa 

and threw hi m out of the car. I went back, to try t o get back, 
cause it™s

two million dol-dollars now, and i t™s a legiti mate transfer of deed ownership. He 
sold that 10 ti mes already, you know? Because he wouldn™t connected with it Œ the 

soldier. But I have no right to have that house. 

Q: So the house you Œ this was the house you had been living in Œ  

A: Right.  
Q: Œ with your grandmother and aunt. 
A: Œ 
right, yeah.
 
Q: So as soon as t he y say, you know, sign over, he™ll be safe, the y turn around and Œ 

A: Yes. And this i s just  about the highlights. I could sit here and talk to you for 

days, because I only put everything in a nutshell. But since that Œ when I was four 

years old, and came out to 
America
, it was nothing good, only bad. B ut not just  a 
little bad, a drama. A t hing where people don™t get through easy. I went in 
America 
to Œ for 20 years, for cl inical psychiatry st udies. I had so much hatred in me. I had 
so Œ never wanted to forgive, never. But by psychiatrists I™m told, if you forgive, 

you release y
ourself, you are the winner. You don™t hold the Œ the bitt erness against 
people. They Œ if you really Œ if you forgive them, you are the winner, not the ot her 

people. And I felt that t hese people are educated, and smart, and Œ and Œ and for 20 

years, I went to these meetings. Did I forgive? I don™t know. Did I forget? No. But 

I™m going on with m y l ife. I™m not a religious Jew, I™m not. Never been. I do

believe in miracles, because the cross was a mi racle. But, I cannot express what I 
feel, because what I would say is not legiti mat e. But I thank whoever took care of 

me, and made that cross fell out from my purse. And whoever watched over me, 

and God di d that, and I™m very grat eful for it. And if you have some question, 

please answer me. Ans Œ 
ask me.
 
Q: So, what was happening with your stepmother and half -sister during the war? 

A: Yeah.  

Q: Your father is sent t o forced labor, but what about Œ 

A: What 
Œ before? For three years they were married. 
Q: Yes.  

A: And m y father worked, and my stepmother, right awa y, she was very business-

like. She worked. She had made a little business for herself. The Œ the boots, what 
the government didn™t use, which was Œ had a cut at the leg for some reason, she 
bought up those boots, and she opened a lit tle Œ not even a store, l ike a peddler, you 

know? And she sold that, and she made so much money. She liked me. She 

preferred I don™t live there, because I was sti ll a package from the previous 

marriage. But if Œ I can™t sa y that she was mean to me or anything. The sister was a 

different story. The sist er said that the father Œ m y father loved me much more than 

loved her. And my stepmother used to say, no, it™s not true. So, she had the Œ she

has problems. She went back to 
Hung a ry
 to live, and my stepmother lived here in 
America
, marri
ed three times. If I want to be ugly, I would sa y, buri ed three 
husband. But I have nothing to complain about her, nothi ng. So, past 20 years, I 

went back to visit t hem. And she said, Daddy i s looking down, and he™s very happy 

that you come and visit  us. And so, whatever t ruth in it i s, I did. 
Q: And did your Œ your aunt and your grandmother were hiding separately Œ 
A: Yes.  
Q: Œ during the 
[indeci phera ble]
 
A: The y survived t he war. 

Q: Did they ever talk about what i t was like in hiding? 

A: No. Wasn™t much to talk. That Mrs. 
Mo na
(ph) was a saint. You know, she took 
care of Grandma, and t h-the people who 
E lla
 went to, the y Œ they Œ 
t h ey 
Œ they Œ 
the y Œ the y think she was an angel, you know? I mean, she did so many favor. That 

time, peopl e didn™t make donations, you know? Or have people li ke the newspaper 

boy. When he needed some books or something, came to 
Ella
 and sa ys, could you 
help me out? I give you back the mone y. So she gave hi m the money, and always 

helped hi m. And Œ  and I guess that ™s why he did what he did. I don™t know. That ™s 

what he did. And a good deed comes back. Good deed comes back to you. And you 

must believe that. Ma ybe not that same day, or week, or month, or year, but in a

lifetime, what you do good, it wil l come back to you. And I™m very fortunate, I have 
wonderful children. Wonderful children. Ambitious, and good, and Œ 
m y son is 60 
years old, was last week, and every mother says that, I think what I have the best 

children in the worl d. I™m probably a little prejudiced, but that™s oka y. That™s oka y. 

And so are m y grandchildren. I™m very close to them. My husband died 15 years 
ago. He had the aneurysm, and in two weeks, he died. He didn™t suffer with cancer 
or anything, which I was very grateful for. 

Q: And he was a survivor as well? 

A: Yes, he was. He was from 
Czechoslovakia
. He was on a Œ 
on a 
Œ on a bus, 
transport bus there. I mean, I didn™t  know hi m then. And he jumped off the bus, and 

he broke his knee. And the bus st opped, and they, with their rifle, the y hit his knee, 

the one that  was broken, til he passed out . And they left hi m there. He said, this is 
your punishment, to try to escape. His father was a very rich man. His father comes 
from north 
Hunga ry
, northern 
Hungary
, 
Ungvár
, it™s Œ he had t he winery, huge 
winery. Was very rich, and very powerful man. And he went to 
Auschwitz
, and 

they couldn™t kill hi m. The y did Œ he was such a strong, big man, whatever job the y 

gave hi m, he did it. And the last da y, the y shot  him. He di dn™t come with me for the 

therapy, he couldn™t . He sa ys, I can™t 
pour out m y heartto astranger. Henever 

came with me. And that wasn™t the best for the marriage, because he had that 

 
Interview with Edith Palkowitz

bitterness, that memory, losing his mother, and get a stepmother. But, that™s was Œ 
in 
Euro pe
 they did that , you know 
[indeciphera ble]
 in bi rth, she died. Birth for 
hi m, in his birth, she died. And then the father remarried, and he was oka y with the 

stepmother. 

Q: And so he Œ he was on a transport to go to a camp, and that™s when he Œ he 
jumped off? 
A: He was taken for transport, to go to another camp Œ
 
Sam
, m y husband 
Œ  
Q: Yes.  

A: Œ and he wanted to escape. In the narrow street with a lot of trees, he wanted t o Œ 

he jumped out, he did. And somehow the driver saw it in the mirror, whatever he Œ I 

don™t know. 

Q: And the y Œ then they, after beati ng hi m, left hi m. 
A: Yes.  
Q: And then he was abl e Œ 

A: The y thought t hat he was dead, and somebody found hi m. Some people, I don™t 

know. I don™t even know what country was it, 
Hungary
 or Œ or 
Poland
, I don™t 
know what  country was it. And they brought him back t o health. So, we could not 

survive without those Christian people, t he ones helped us, not regarding the

consequences, what comes helping a Jew. And those are the people we are very 
grateful to. 

Q: So you Œ you mentioned that you visited Œ you visited 
Hungary 
several ti mes. 

A: Yes.  

Q: Œ since moving to 
America
. Was it strange being back? 
A: I didn™t look at the houses, I di dn™t look at anything. I sta yed i n a hotel. 

Someti mes I went with friends, with American friends. And Œ but I don™t like to go 

to a hotel by m yself. It™s not for a special reason. And then we Œ with my friend 

being 
[indecipherable]
 trip to 
Italy
, or whatever, some other places, and then we 
visited 
Irene
, m y stepmother,and
 m y stepsister. And we st-
stayed with them two, 
three, four da ys, five days, according to 
a 
plan. 
Q: I guess, was it Œ was it Œ 
A: Was hard.  
Q: Yeah.  

A: Was hard. And then late Œ later, I visit Œ visited or so frequently, because it got  

more painful. And as you get older, it™s harder to deal with it. But I di d visit, I really 

did. But then m y stepsister died, m y stepmother died. She was 92, my stepmother. 

And that was the end of that story. 

Q: So you Œ you speak to school groups now? 

 
Interview with Edith Palkowitz  
 
August 26, 2016 
 
 
 
42
 
A: Pardon?  
Q: Y-You speak to all kinds of groups now, about your experiences. What 
made 
you decide to do that? 

A: Which part of it? 

Q: I guess, what Œ what  made you decide to start speaking to groups, and telling 
them about your experi ences? 
A: Oh. I was invited first, in a jail. And then I was invited Œ it™s a name
, a leave 
Œ 

life Œ or 
a leave 
Œ a life. It™s a group which is built by the government, and 

teenagers, 12, 13, 14, 15 Œ and I go there every year Œ 
are pregnant. Sothis 

organization take them to high school, and teach them high school, and the y 

arranging a nursery for the children. And t he y were very down. I didn™t say half of 

m y story. Less than hal f. But I encourage them t hat there is no choice not to do 
anyt hing, because if you don™t do anything, you™re going backwards. And who 
wants to go backwards? Your child doesn™t deserve for you to give up. So I gave a 

pep talk, versus my talk. And it worked, i t worked, the Œ some of them started to 

cry. The y invited me every year, and Œ and that was the beginning. And then 

schools asked me t o make speeches. And depends on the audience, depends on t he 

people how much do I say of the bitter life I had. Depends on that . I do not sa y 

everything. I say some. For instance, in 
B udapest
, the soldiers t ook the women up 

 
Interview with Edith Palkowitz

to the ho Œ office, to do office work, but that wasn™t office work. When they were 
finding the second floor, third floor, five Œ fifth floor, it was two, three men raped 

the women. Some didn™t come back at all, and the ones came back, I wish I couldn™t 

come back. Bleeding, beaten up, black and blue. And that™s how t he y co Œ 
came 

back. So this is Œ this is Œ this is a country occupation. It happens in every country. 
But I wore the Œ I mean, I was so young, I wore a kerchief around m y head, a black 
kerchief, so I look ugly Œ not that I™m so beautiful, but I look ugly, and Œ and older, 

and didn™t look anywhere like a Œ 
a retarded
 person I looked. I wanted to be Œ I 

didn™t want  to take Œ I mean, with due respect , I didn™t want to be taken. 

Q: And thi s was all soldiers that were doing it? 

A: Yes, Hungarians, and German. 

Q: What about the Sovi et soldiers, when t he y came? Did this conti nue? 
A: We didn™t see sov Œ Soviet in the beginning. On the tai l end, we di d. We did. 
Q: Were there also rapes? 

A: I don™t know, really. But we were very cl ose to the German and the Hungarian 

soldiers. And tha
t was 
Œ that was somethi ng which happened Œ I mean, watching the 

countries, what happens in the country, and transporting human being, and selling 

human beings, it happens all the time. But to me, that was the first one. That was 

the first experience, when the y Œ 
the y 
Œ the y Œ they transporting Œ they using human

beings. And to me that was a terribl e thing. A t errible thing, which is 
unexcusable
. 
Here you make mone y onit. There wasn™t even mo
ne y on it. It was coming to them. 
And we were very l ucky, because t he was started four years ago. We were the last  

country to be occupied. So we had only 11 months of the occupation, where four Œ 

and then the other countries had three, four years. 
Q: And something else I wanted to ask you about the war years, and the years 
leading up, did you ever s Œ what was the ar Œ the 
Arrow
 
Cross
 doing in 
Hungary
? 
The fa Œ the Hungarian Fascist party, I thi nk it ™s 
Nyilas
? 

A: 
Nyilas
, yes, 
Nyilas
. 
Q: What were Œ what were they doing? Do you remember any specific incidents, or 

Œ 

A: Yes, I remember. First of all, the y wear Œ t hey wore a feather in t heir hats. Why 
is it important to me, because I Œ I Œ I was t ransferred to a Œ a big factory, at one 
time, for a month or so, with 
Ella
. And we were hiding in the gutter, and we saw the 
feather, and then we just pla yed dead. But  that ™s m y af Œ incident. But  the y were a 

little bit more educated than the average sol dier. The y were like teaching the 

average soldier how to kill the Jews. And the y were firm believer of t he Germans 

[indecipherable]
. 
Firm believer, 
Nyilas
. You Œ you™re free to mention that. It™s a 

word you don™t want to be any connection wit h.

Q: So the y Œ 
they were morefeared 
Œ  
A: Yes, yes. As I said, the y were more educat ed than the average people. Educated 
by the government, and then the Germans took over their education. And that 

wasn™t an education like the five subjects. It was one subject; how to kill the Jews. 

That™s what he want ed, a pure country. There is only whi te peopl e, and Christian 
people, and he Œ that™s what he wanted. 
Hi tler
. 
Q: Did you hear any Œ any rumors about t he 
Da nube 
shootings, by the 
Arrow
 
Cross
?  
A: Yes. I don™t Œ I didn™t see it, but I was t old t hat the y tied their hands together i n 

the back, the y tied t heir feet together, they Œ 
they 
Œ they pushed t hem into the water, 
and then the y shot them. And there are shoes on the 
[indecipherable]
 of Œ 

children™s shoes, grown-up shoes, all shoes, because there were lot of, lot of 
children there. How did they got awa y wi th it ? In Œ in school, I used to sit at the 
desk of  the teacher Œ not sit on t he desk, near the desk, and I saw the globe. And I 

was pla ying with i t, and then it occurred to me, nobody hears us, nobody sees us, 

what™s goi ng on. Not one person in the world would help us. Why? And the world 

is big. And why we didn™t get any help? But of course, I never got the answer. 

Q: And the shoes, you™re talking about the memorial? 

A: Yes. Yeah.

A: The what? 
Q: Did you hear anythi ng else specific about t he

? 
A: No. No. 

Q: It was j ust they were don Œ you were almost afraid to sa y the word 
Nyilas
, or Œ 
A: I don™t hear you wel l. 
Q: I guess you were Œ it was more of a general  Œ you Œ you don™t  even sa y the word 

Nyilas
. That™s how much it was Œ 

A: No, no. No wa y, no way, no way. Unless you sa y, I love the 
Nyilas
. That™s all  

you were all owed to say. I mean, wouldn™t  thi nk about it. Wouldn™t t hink about it. I 

mean, it was fire, you know? It was fire. Every house was injured, e
very person was 

injured, an-and that™s why I left. I didn™t want to live there. And you hear, and heard 
now, that I had a very difficult journe y. Yet, I was told, go back, go back, aren™t you 
homesick? No way. No wa y. The only thi ng I had there is m y mother™s grave, 

nothing else. I think we should end this com Œ this intervi ew. Unl ess you have other 

questions.  

Q: I had one more, if that™s oka y. 

A: Oka y, sure. Speak up.

Q: You mentioned that you and your aunt were in a brick fac Œ held in a brick 
factory Œ 

A: Yeah.  

Q: Œ for a short ti me. Was this Œ was this after the stadium, and after the safe house? 

A: Yes. After the safe house, after the stadium. Was before the marching, before th-
the ghetto.  
Q: Before the ghetto. 

A: Wasbetweenthe same hou 
Œ safe house and the ghetto. We were there a few 
weeks.  

Q: And what Œ what were the condi tions li ke in the brick factory?  

A: I don™t remember, but I don™t even know what we did t here. I don™t remember. I 

mean, 70 years ago, you know. But I do remember that we have t o find our own Œ 
own transportation, and we were l ooking to st op a car or a bus or somet hing. And 
then I saw 
th
-the feather, and then we pla yed dead. Everybody knew about it, very 
few people didn™t. You couldn™t ignore it. 

Q: So 
[indecipherable]
 
my 
Œ m y last question is, is there anything we haven™t 
talked about already, that you would like to add to the int erview? 

A: Nothing more what would help to understand m y life. Little t hings, which 

doesn™t mean anything. For instance, I went to that fruit stand, and while the guy 

 
Interview with Edith Palkowitz

was back getting me fruit, I stole an egg, t o take it to Grandma, a nd I put it in m y 
blouse. I went to Grandma, and she ran, 
Chirpy
,
 
Chirpy
, and she hugged me, and 
she broke the egg. But this is not a story, not part of a story which has any Œ 
any 

factor in it, you know? And little t hings l ike that. 

Q: So Œ 
and  y 
Œ you think we covered everyt hi ng that you would like to Œ 
A: Yes, I do. 

Q: Œ to add. 

A: I really do. Thank you so much for y Œ for your patience, and your questions and 

the wa y you conducted yourself up Œ you know, up to now, to meet, and I do 

appreciate it.  

Q: Oh, I Œ I thank you. 

A: You™re welcome. 
Q: So this Œ this concludes the 
United States
 
Holocaust Memorial Museum

, on August 26
th
, 2106.  
A: Those are m y parent s; my mother and m y father, from when Œ when the y got 
married, in 1926. The y both of Œ both of them were taken away from me during t he 

war, and at t he very earl y age, I became an orphan. 

Q: Did you want us to get your phone, or are you oka y? 

A: No, no.

Q: Oka y, let me get  one more shot  of this.  
A: This picture is from my beloved grandmother, who raised me after my mother 

died, and I™m holdi ng t here m y litt le doll. As you can see my face, I was very sad 

because my mother wastakenawa yfrom me.
 
Q: And how old do you think you wer
e?
 
A: I think I was seven, eight years old. I was four when m y mother died – I was 

eight or nine years old here, wearing the Hungarian national dress out fit. That was a 

celebration, some sort of, and it™s a great honor to be in it. I know I was sa ying a 

poem, and i t was a great honor for me. Everyone was very proud. This picture was 

taken wa y after the war, behind the 
Dohan
 Temple, which is the largest temple i n 

the eastern 
Euro pe
. Every leaf is dedicated to someone who died there. When 
people came back, before this was put up, they dug with your Œ t heir hands to find 
relatives, si blings, chil dren, but very few was Œ even pieces of the bodies. So the y 
put up this beautiful tree. The leaves are silver, and every leaf has a monogram.
