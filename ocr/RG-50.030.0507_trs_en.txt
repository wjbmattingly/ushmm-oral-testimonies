Question: Good morning, Betsy. 
Answer: Good morning, Joan. 

Q: It™s -- it™s -- it™s very ni
ce to see you here. Tell me  -- 
A: Thank you. It™s good to be here. 

Q: Good, I™m glad. Tell me  what was your name  when you were born. 

A: Was the same as it is now, because my husband had the same last name. 

Q: Uh-huh. So tell me  what --

A: In Amsterdam, the Netherlands. 

Q: Right. Now, what I™d like us to do is talk a 
little bit about what your
 life was like before the 
Nazis came. So I™d like to know about your f -- your fa mily and your house and all of that. So let 

me  first ask you about your fath
er, I know you were very close to
 your father. What -- what did 
he do? 

A: We ll, my  father was a pastry baker, and 
he had a coffee house, I think you™d call it a coffee 
house here, in the heart of Amsterdam. And then
 the depression came, and he couldn™t keep it

up. But my mother was an accountant, so then my mother took over and became the 
breadwinner. 

Q: Uh-huh. But your -- your father also wa
s a pastry chef on a ship, right -- 
A: Yes, he worked -- 

Q: -- on the -- was it the Dutch Holland line? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: And that was before you were born? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Yes. So do you reme mber him ba king in the house? 

A: Oh yes. He baked every Sunday, some thing -- 

Q: Yes? 

A: -- very good. 

Q: Yep. So he was a good chef, he was a good pastry chef? 
A: I think so -- 
Q: You think so. 

A: -- they -- they wanted him to go a bit after the 
first World War, and at 
that time he said, I™ve 
had enough, I want to settle down. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And they really put the pre
ssure on him to go, and he didn™t 
want to go. And as it happened, 
that ship was torpedoed. 

Q: Really?  So that was fortunate 
that he said no, wasn™t it, yes. 
A: That he said no.

Q: So what kind -- how do you reme mber him duri
ng those early years as a father?  What was -- 
what was he like? 
A: He was a kind, patient, tolerant, wonderful person. 

Q: Yes?  Did he have a good sense of humor? 

A: Oh yes -- 

Q: Yeah? 

A: -- that too, yes. 

Q: And did you do things with him alone?  Did he take you for walks? 

A: Yes. 

Q: He did. And so did you have conversations with
 him about what you were doing, or -- or did 
you -- 

A: Do you mean just before the war? 

Q: Before the war, -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- yes. When -- when you had these walks. 

A: We -- 

Q: We re you -- 

A: We ll, he walked me  to school, he walk ed me  to grade school that first year. 

Q: Really? 

A: Mm-hm. That™s a 10 mi nutes walk. 

Q: So that™s nice.

Q: Did he pick you up as well, or did you walk home by yours  -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507

A: Yes. 
Q: He picked you up also? 

A: Mm-hm. For a little while. 

Q: Uh-huh. So was he working at all, or at 
a certain point he wasn
™t working, he was -- 
A: No, he wasn™t working. 

Q: He wasn™t working. So who cooked meals in the house? 

A: We ll, supposedly Mother hired a young lady 
to -- to help her in 
-- with the laundry. 
Q: Right. 

A: And with cooking. And we didn™t always have the same  young lady. 

Q: Right. 

A: But one time  we had one who came from 
Sta r ving, Germany, who was happy to be in the 
Netherlands. 

Q: Really. 
A: And she was very young, and we became the 
closest of friends. And she lived in -- 
Q: Uh-huh, right. 
A: -- with us. And she took me  to the movies, an
d walks, and -- and she was Catholic, and she 
showed me  all these beautiful images of Jesus 
Christ, and -- and Mother 
Maria, and I was just 
fascinated by that. 

Q: Really?  Did she take you to church? 

A: No. 

Q: She didn™t? 

A: No. 

Q: But she showed you these pictures, and all -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507

A: The pictur es. 
Q: I see. Did she live insi -- in the apart --

A: Yeah, we had s -- we had the spare room.

A: I would say probably three years. 

Q: That™s a long time. 

A: Yes. 

Q: And at what -- do you reme mber approxima te
ly what age you were when she was there? 
A: Yes, mm-hm, four and a half, th
ree and a half, five and a half. I 
think she left when I went to 
grade school. 

Q: So you were a really young kid. 
A: Yes. 
Q: And was -- this was before your sister was born? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Uh-huh. So was it odd for you to have your
 father at home  and your mother be the 
breadwinner, was that an odd circumstance? 

A: Not for me .  

Q: Not for you, but for -- wi -- in term
s of what you saw around you, is it -- 
A: I didn't compare. 

Q: You didn™t compare, uh-huh. 

A: I didn't compare.

Q: We ll, that™s good. 
A: I -- I didn™t reali
ze it, I didn™t know.  
Q: Right, right. 

A: You know, the working, so forth, fa mily -- 

Q: Sure. 

A: -- and what -- who should have what role. 

Q: Right. 

A: To me, this is what was happening, and so I accepted it. 

Q: Right. 

A: I wasn™t thinking about that. 

Q: What was your mother like? 

A: She came from Vienna, Austria, and she came to the Netherlands, because after World War 
1
, 
that was the land of milk and honey. And she 
found a job at the bank, and through mu tual 
friends, my mother and father me t. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And there were 10 years 
between them, and that -- 
Q: And your father was 10 years older? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Yes. Mother was -- came  from a fa mily that 
-- from Vienna fo -- cu
lture, and everything, and 
my dad, he was the fifth boy in the fa mily, the fi
fth and the last boy. And he has three or four, 

five lu -- five name . And my father -- when 
my fa ther came  along, there wa s just enough money 
for prep -- vocation such
 as pastry baker. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507

Q: I see. So he come s fr -- he came  from a different economical -- 
A: Different environment -- 

Q: -- di-different environment. 

A: -- altogether. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And Mother came fr -- from -- well, her dad was from Galicia, and her mo m was  from 

Hungary. And her mo m™s dad was a rabbi, and so 
my -- my grandma wa s very fine, very soft 
spoken, intelligent woma n. My grandfather was from
 Galicia, and he had a 
toy store in Vienna. 
That™s how they ma ke a living. 

Q: That mus t  have been nice for you as a kid to 
go to Vienna and visit 
them, with a toy store. 
A: Yes. 

Q: Did you get lots of toys from it? 

A: No. 
Q: You didn™t? 
A: No. We  went a lot of -- through a lot of pa
rks, walking, and sightse
eing, and looked at the 
opera house from the outside, we didn't  go in. 

Q: You didn't go in. We re you -- did you find your 
grandmother easier to 
be with than your 
grandfather? 

A: Definitely. 

Q: Yes. 

A: Yeah. Yeah, and I think my 
-- my  mother got a lot of pers
onality traits from her dad. 
Q: I see. So she was mor e  difficult to be with. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
8 
 
 
A: Mm-hm. She was a -- he was a perfectioni st
, and so was she. And if I came home  with a 
report card that had two B™s a
nd all A™s, she would say, that™s not good, why don™t you have all 
A -- B -- A™s on there. And my dad would say, th
at™s a pretty good report card. And that was the 
difference be tween those t -- 

Q: Yes, so was that -- that must have been
 difficult for you as a child growing up, having these 
expectations. Or -- or wa
s it good for you?  Do you know? 
A: At that time  it was good for me . 

Q: It was?  

A: Mm-hm. It became  more diffi
cult as I -- after. When I had 
to live with my uncle, who was 
Mother™s brother, who was -- he wa
s some wher e in the genius range. 
Q: Really? 

A: And he couldn™t understand why I couldn™t unde
rstand some  things, or get some  things as 
quickly as he did. 
Q: As he did. And of course you were much younger also, so -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- the expectation was -- so it became diffic
ult. You know, I forgot to ask you, what was your 
father™s na me? 

A: Jacques -- that™s -- Jack is name d 
after him. This is the French Jacques. 
Q: Jacques, yes. 

A: Theobold Alfred Karl Frederick. 

Q: So it™s ma ny name s, and Cohen is the last name . 

A: Yes.  

Q: How come  he had s o ma ny na mes, do you know? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
9 
 
 
A: Because he had -- he  was the last one in a 
row of five boys. There were five boys in that 
fa mily. 
Q: But you -- you did say earlier that -- that each
 child, depending upon where they were in the 
birth sequence, they would get more name s?  So 
your father had five name s  because he was the 
fi ft h?  

A: Yes, but I don™t believe they did 
that with the children before that. 
Q: With -- but just with him.  

A: With him. Because he was also the last  one. 

Q: I see. So he got all the name s -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- that they didn™t give to ot
her -- was he known as Jacques? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Or was he -- that™s -- that™s how he was known? 
A: Yes. 
Q: Did you notice when -- when you were growing 
up that your parents got along well, or -- 
because they seem so differe
nt. From your description -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- they seem so very different. It seems as
 if it mi ght be difficult in the house. Wa s it? 
A: Yes [indecipherable] 

Q: It was?  

A: Mm-hm, someti mes. 

Q: Did you all eat together as a family?  Did you eat -- 

A: Yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507

Q: -- dinner together at n -- 
A: Yes, we did. 

Q: -- noontime or some t hing. You did. 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: Wa s there a lot of discussi
on then, did they ask you and when Hedy was old enough to speak, 
did they ask her questions, or was ita very quiet meal, do you reme mber ? 

A: They mo stly talked to each other,
 they didn™t ask too ma ny things -- 
Q: No, huh. 

A: -- from us. That came later -- I mean later in the day, because we would always have tea about 

an hour after dinner. 

Q: I see. 

A: And the tea we would have in our living room
 upstairs, whereas we had dinner in the kitchen, 
downstairs. 
Q: Uh-huh. And would your mother and father be ups
tairs at tea, or just 
your father with you? 
A: Everybody -- 
Q: Everybody was -- 

A: -- wa -- was there, yeah, and that™s
 when we got to talk some  more. 
Q: I see, so that was a more informal -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- situation. So was dinner a 
very, sort of formal meal? 
A: No. 

Q: No. 

A: That was really not formal -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
11 
 
 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: -- except -- well, Mother was working and th
en she was telling some  events of the day -- 
Q: I see. 

A: -- to -- to my husband. 

Q: Right. You mean to her husband.  

A: To her husband. 

Q: To her -- her husband. 

A: Yes. 

Q: Right, you said my, right. We re you surprise
d when Hedy was born?  We
re you told that your 
mother was pregnant? 

A: Yes. 

Q: You were told. 

A: I was told, but I was told I would have a sister
, or a little brother. N
o, not little, I™d have a 
sister or a brother. 

Q: Right. 

A: And I was eight years old at th
e time, and I thought I would have a 
sister just like me , just as 
old as I was and everything. And so when I saw he
r in the crib in the hos
pital, and she was the 
sister, well oh, I can™t play with her. I was very surprised. 

Q: And you -- were you disappointed? 

A: Yes, yes I was. 

Q: Cause you expected to have
 some one who was your equal. 
A: Yes. I -- I expected to have a playma te. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
12 
 
 
A: Instead I had to have 
-- I was -- became a babysitter. 
Q: Right. So your parents didn™t 
really explain to you that it 
wa s a baby that was going to 
happen. 
A: No, not at that time. 

Q: Not at that time .  

A: No. 

Q: And so when you said to them, I can™t play with 
this, this is a 
-- this is a baby, did -- did they 
think you didn™t -- that you should have understood?
 I mean, what did they do?  Did they try to 
explain it to you then, or not? 

A: No. 

Q: No. 

A: No. 

Q: So were you annoyed at this
 baby who can™t do anything? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Yeah. And did you became a 
babysitter pretty quickly? 
A: Yes. 

Q: So at age eight you™re taking ca re of a little teeny baby? 

A: Yeah. And I had to take 
her to the park for walks. 
Q: Uh-huh, right. 

A: Spent the whole -- at that time  we
 had no school on We dne sday afternoon. 
Q: Really? 

A: And no school on Saturday afternoon, and those afte
rnoons I better take out
 my sister or else. 
Q: Really?  And what wa
s your sister™s name? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
13 
 
 
A: Hedwig. She -- she wa s here. 
Q: Yes, that™s right, she -- we had -- 

A: Hedwig Hella. 

Q: Right. Now was -- was hel -- Hella 
the mi ddle name , or was that a -- 
A: No, th -- it was just na -- another first name . 

Q: Another first -- oh, so she had two 
o -- two first name s?  Hedwig Hella. 
A: Hedwig Hella. 

Q: And she™s now known as Hedy. 

A: Yes. 

Q: Hedy [indecipherable] 

A: But she was known as Hedy. 

Q: Hedy. 

A: Yes, we all called her Hedy, but then when she came to the States -- 
Q: Yes. 
A: -- everybody called he r Hedy. So we called her Hedy at home  still. 

Q: Right. 

A: But everybody else called her Hedy. 

Q: But would you have spelled it the same  way?  

A: No. 

Q: No, you wouldn™t, right?  Would you 
have spelled it H-a-i-d-y, Haidy? 
A: Haidy?  H- e-d-y. 

Q: You would have spelled it that way -- 

A: Mm-h m.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
14 
 
 
Q: -- the same  way as she spells it 
now. But you don™t pronounce it the same  way. 
A: Yeah, Hedy. 
Q: Hedy. Hm. So was there a point as -- as Haid
 -- I™m going to call her Hedy, when -- as she™s 
growing up that you find that she can become  a play
ma te, or is the age difference so big -- cause 
you™re eight years older. 

A: Yes. 

Q: That™s a big -- it™s a big -- 

A: It was a big difference. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Yes. 

Q: So she was always a kid. 

A: Yes.

A: I liked -- I was an only child, and I was lonely
. And I enjoyed being w
ith all the children, and

Q: So before you went to school, 
did you not have a lot of friends? 
A: No. 

Q: You didn™t. 

A: Not of my own age, no. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: I never went to a -- the school before -- 

Q: A nursery school or some thing.

five years old or si

A: Yes, I d -- 

Q: What -- what -- which is sort of unusual I wo
uld guess, in some  respects, so what did you -- 
what did you do when you were by yourself
?  What kinds of things did you do? 
A: Well, at the time Queen Wilhemi na had reache
d a 40 year reign, and they made tiles for that, 
and distributed them to the children in school, and 
all kinds of other little things to m- me morize 
this. 

Q: Right.

so I had a lot of them on my nightstand. 

Q: Little toys you mean, or --

 wooden statue, or a very beau
tiful what do you call these round

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And introduced me  to everything in the 
library, and I fell in 
love with reading. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: In fact, I fell so much in love with reading 
that after I was supposed to go to bed and sleep, I 
had myself a  little flashlight a
nd crawled over the cover and read. 
Q: Right. 
A: For awhile. 
Q: Yes. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Was it hard to re
ad under the covers? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Yes, it™s pretty diffi cult, isn™
t it? But it™s wonderful that  you were reading so much. What was 
-- what kinds of things were
 you reading, do you reme mber ? 
A: Yes, Jules Verne. My dad liked Jules Verne. 

Q: Really? 

A: So I started reading Jules Verne. I got se
veral of his books and was fascinated by that.

Q: Right. 
A: Then I discovered my mo m had a n anatomy book 
in her closet, and when I could get at it, I 
took it and -- and studied 
it, and read about that. 

Q: Really?  In her closet? How 
did you know it was in her closet? 
A: We ll, she had like upstairs

Q: Right. 

A: And our little quarter s upstairs, except for the kitchen. 

Q: Uh-huh.  

A: And -- 

Q: And whe r e was the kitchen? 

A: The kitchen was sort of in the back part -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- sort of sticki ng out. And my room was above 
that kitchen, and that was very nice because I 
was partly already in our own backyard. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And with a view on the coal shed. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And the coal shed wa s a gathering place for cats, and they came there and they -- they sang 

their horrible song. And I would get up, take
 a big glass of water and throw it. 
Q: Really?  So -- I see, would they wa ke you up? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: They did, cause they were talking to each ot
her, right. But you also got the smells from the 
kitchen, so that must have been 
very nice. Or did you?  You didn™t. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
19 
 
 
A: No, I didn't get any smells. 
Q: Uh-huh, I see.

you would sit and listen to the piano? 

A: Oh yeah.

Q: You like piano in particular. 

A: Yes. 

Q: Did you want to take lessons? 

A: No. 

Q: No?  How come ?  
A: No, it was like -- well, I felt I didn™t have the 
patience. I didn™t want to
 spend time practicing. 
Q: I see. 
A: I wasn™t that crazy about it that
 I wanted to do it myself. I just 
felt I -- I wasn™t -- I -- I wasn™t 
cut out for that. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: And -- and Hedy, she had to take it. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: When we came to uncle and aunt  in the States --

bang, bang. I-I st ill di dn™t want to take them when I had another chance, but -- 

Q: But you didn™t want to do it.

Q: And would you sit on the window
sill in your -- in your room?  
A: Yes, I would. 

Q: And listen t -- 

A: Yes, I would. 

Q: And was this person good?

Q: That you were sti -- 

A: -- that I was listening. 

Q: Uh-huh. And did you know hi m?  

A: Just enough to say hello. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: He was a young ma n in his 20™s and that™s all I knew. 

Q: Right. But you didn't say to him, you know, I listen to you and it™s wonderful. 

A: No. 

Q: No.

Beginning Ta pe Two 
Q: Betsy, the neighborhood that you
 lived in, I know that in 
Amsterdam there was a kind of 
Jewish neighborhood, but you didn™t liv
e in that neighborhood, right? 
You lived in a -- a mi xed 
neighborhood? 
A: Yes. 

Q: We re there ma ny Jews who lived there, or not? 

A: No. 

Q: No, there weren™t.  

A: It was -- was a little -- no, 
it was sort of a ritzy street -- 
Q: It was. 

A: -- on which we lived. And the whole neighbor
hood, from our house to the 
school was sort of -
- not rich, but upper mi ddle class. 

Q: And would you reme mber the name  of the street? 
A: Oh yes. 
Q: What was it? 

A: Pieter de 
Hooch Street. 
Q: Pieter de Hooch Street
. Wa s your fa mily religious? 
A: No, my father was actually an
 atheist, and he taught me  that
 so far as he was concerned, I 
didn't have to do anything until I was 18, and the
n, he said then I could make up my mi nd, did I 
want to be Jewish, did I want to
 be religious too. But Mother ca
me  from a more religious fa mily. 
But so that I didn™t go to school on the high 
holidays and I didn™t go to school on Passover. 
Q: So -- go ahead. You were going to say some thing. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
23 
 
 
A: We  didn™t -- we didn™t celebrate Chanukah be
cause in Holland they celebrate Saint Nicholas, 
and that is December the fifth. And he is not th
e Christma s man who come
s here at Christmas, 
no. He was a -- a saint from Turkey, and he he
lped poor children. He would -- as the legend 
goes, he would throw food into the orphanage 
backyard, and he was supposed to come  every 
year from Spain, with his ship, and a black 
assi stant, Schwartze Piet, and a white horse . 
Q: Really? 

A: That way he woul
d come, every year. 
Q: Uh-huh. So everybody celebrated -- 

A: Yes, ev-everybody. 

Q: So was that a religious holiday in some  way or
 not?  It wasn™t terribly 
religious, was it -- is -- 
A: No, it was not at all re
ligious. It was a fun day. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Everybody had parties, and it was a little bitof a tradition to writea little poem, when you 
gave some body a gift, and you could -- you could be
 very -- you could be 
criticizing the person 
to whom you gave it, but ma ke fun, i n a fun way. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: So it was a really wonderful celebration. I ne
ver heard the word Chanukah until I came to the 
States. 

Q: Really?  But you knew of 
other Jewish holidays -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- because you did -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: So were you very conscious of being Jewi
sh, or some wha t  conscious, what do you think? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
24 
 
 
A: We ll, it was my mot her who ma de me  conscious. 
Q: Not your father. 

A: And well, in retrospect, I can see what happe 
-- my mothe r  kept saying to me  I wa s Jewish 
and I had to be careful because there we
re so ma ny anti-Semites in the world. 
Q: And she said that to you when you were quite young? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: What did you think about that? 

A: I didn™t agree with her because I hadn™t -- I-I ha
dn™t felt any until the very last  year, I used to 
pick up two friends along the way to school. 
And the first ones were quite -- you know, did you 

ever hear the word [indecipherable]? They were 
very conservative and the father came  from a 
fa mily that had a plantation in the East Indies. 
So they were very well-to-do, but they were not 
very friendly, they were cold. And so even was the 
girl whom I picked up, but
 I didn™t want to go 
to school all by myself. 
Q: Right. So at what point would -- we were 
talking about whether you ever experienced anti-
Semitism. Was she antis -- was that fa mily anti-Semitic? 
A: No, just cold. 

Q: Just cold. So when your mother is warning 
you that there are a lot 
of people who are anti-
Se mitic in the world, you just don™t find this to
 be the case, you™re 
not -- that™s not your 
experience. It was -- 

A: No, that was not my experience -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- until Hitler came. 

Q: Until Hitler came. And did your father hear 
that your mother was saying this to you? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
25 
 
 
A: Yes. 
Q: And did he say to you, don™
t pay attention, this is no -- 
A: No. 

Q: He didn't say that. 

A: He didn™t say that. 

Q: Uh-huh. So did you say to him wh-why is 
she saying this, I don™t 
-- you know, where -- 
where are the anti-Semites? 

A: No. 

Q: Cause you™re not -- you don™t -- no. 

A: No. 

Q: You didn't question that. So un -- when you™re a very young child, cause you™re born in 1928, 

in 1933 the Nazis take over in Germany. So wh
en you are six or seven years old, do you hear 
about things that are happening in Ge rmany? 
A: We  heard that the Jews were in plight 
ther e, and that they fled to Holland -- 
Q: Uh-huh, Holland, yes, right. 

A: -- a lot. And -- 

Q: And so you heard that? 

A: I-I heard that and I had a friend who was one of them. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: She became  my bosom friend all the wa
y through, as long as we knew each other. 
Q: And did she tell you what was going on in Germany?  

A: No, no. 

Q: Did we -- and you didn™t ask her? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
26 
 
 
A: No. There wasn™t that much talk -- 
Q: I see. 

A: -- at that  time. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: And the father was a lawyer and he r mother
 was a -- a music teacher. And my friend herself 
was very ta-talented. And I -- I 
always came, and he had to pr
actice, but for me  this was a 
pleasure to listen to. And then afterwards sh
e practiced, then we™d do our own thing, but -- 
Q: Right. So did you sit in the room when she was practicing? 

A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: You did? That™s very nice. 

A: Oh yeah.  

Q: So you really loved music, didn'
t you?  Do you still love mu sic? 
A: Yes. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Yes, oh yes.  

Q: Now, let me  ask you some thing. Bef -- before 
you were born, so you can only talk about what 
you™ve heard, I think. Your parents didn™t 
live a-at Pieter H
ooch Strasser, right? 
A: No. 

Q: They lived some where else. 

A: Yes. 

Q: And this has some  significance be
cause of a bakery that™s there. 
A: Yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
27 
 
 
Q: That your mother goes to. So can you talk ab
out -- where did -- where did she go?  She went 
every day to buy some  bread -- 

A: Yes, yes. 

Q: -- from a woma n who came to be known as Tante Toos to you, yes? 

A: Yes. 

Q: So how long did they live in this
 other place?  Do you 
know?  A few years? 
A: Maybe four. That was a differe
nt neighborhood they were -- it 
was called the -- the old new 
south. 

Q: The old new south? 

A: South, yeah. And somehow ma ny of the 
German Jews settled around there, that 
neighborhood. 

Q: I see. But your mother had lots of conversations with this woma n. Every time she went in she 

would talk with her, is that correct? 
A: Yes. 
Q: Yes. So I-I™m just me ntioning this because later on this woman is going to become extremely 

important, in fact ends up saving your lives. 

A: Yes. 

Q: Yes. Do you hear about the anschl
uss in Vienna, in -- in Austria? 
A: Yes. 

Q: Because your grandparents were th
ere, is this very -- di -did they stay in Austria, or did they 
leave and come  to Holland? 

A: They came  with us for a couple of years. 

Q: They did? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
28 
 
 
A: And then they got an apartment of thei
r own, and that™s the last I know of them. 
Q: And you don™t know what else happened, right. Bu
t did your mother™s brother Sam, who ends 
up taking care of you when you come  to the United St
ates, he and his wife, does he come  to stay 
in your apartment?  

A: Yes. 

Q: He does.  

A: Yes, he did stay with us for a year because 
I think he had to wait for a -- his quota number to 
come  up. 

Q: I see. So when does he come ?  In 1940, 1939, do you reme mber? 

A: Well, I was 10 -- 11. 

Q: So it™s ™38 - ™39. 

A: 20 -- ™38 - ™39, yeah. 

Q: So he come s a fter the anschluss -- 
A: Yes. 
Q: -- with the 
grandparents. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: So for awhile it™s your uncle and 
your grandparents that
 are in the house? 
A: Well, my  grandparents didn™t 
stay in the house very long -- 
Q: I see, so he stayed longer. 

A: -- a year, and then they got their own apartment. 

Q: So he stayed for longer than that? 

A: Yeah, he stayed at our house. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
29 
 
 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Now, wa s he trying to convi
nce your parents to leave? 
A: Oh yes. 

Q: But they wouldn't do it? 

A: We ll, my  father would have, but my moth
er thought she has a good job, and she expected a 
big pension and why should she go and forsake 
all that?  And so she 
was not ready to go. 
Q: To do that. Did you know that at the 
time?  Did you hear these conversations? 
A: Yes. 

Q: You did? 

A: Some . 

Q: Some  of them. So were they arguing, was 
your -- was your uncle saying you must go because 
Hitler™s going to do terrible things
, or  -- do you reme mber any of it? 
A: No, I don™t think 
they were arguing. 
Q: Uh-huh, you don™t. 

A: No. 

Q: So how did you know that your uncle was going
 to leave and he was asking your parents to 

take you, the kids, and themselves out
?  Did you overhear these conversations? 
A: No. Hitler came into Holland in May, ™42. When 
he occupied Holland, my father said to me, 
if ever anything happens to us, get in t
ouch with your Uncle Alfred in Ame r ica. 
Q: Do you think he told his -- hi --
 his brother-in-law the same  thing? 
A: Oh yeah, oh yeah. 

Q: He did before. 

A: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
30 
 
 
Q: So the Nazis take over in 
1940 I believe, May of 1940, right?  So 
your father -- but your father 
tells you directly -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- this, right. Did you want to leave?  Did you -- 

A: No. 

Q: You didn™t? 

A: No. 

Q: So you didn™t feel danger
 until the Nazi
s actual -- 
A: We ll, until the last  few months, because the -- 
the We hr macht, they had their offices, and they 
took over the house right next to 
us. And when they were right next to us, and I saw them 
wherever I walked, then I did get scared. 

Q: Then you were sca -- 

A: And that was also the time that they
 told us to wear
 a star on our -- 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- on our garments. 

Q: Right. But that™s a little 
bit later. When -- when you star
t -- you finish gramma r school -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- in 1939, is that right?  And go to gymnasium?  

A: Yeah, I guess so. 

Q: Is it 1939 or 1940? 

A: See, I had the year on a quarter of 
gymnasium, and that 
quarter was in ™42. 
Q: Uh-huh. So ma ybe it™s ™40 -- 
you start in ™41 or late -- 
A: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
31 
 
 
Q: Uh-huh. Right, 1939. So at a certain point 
you can™t go to school, as a young Jewish girl, 
right? You have to go to a Jewish school. The Nazis come  in in 1940. 
A: Yeah, they came and then after awhile they chased out all the Jewish -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- professors, and all the Jewish students, and th
ey mi  -- they took a building that used to be a 
really Jewish school, but they took over that 
building, and people -- Jewish people from all over 
Amsterdam were congregated there, a
nd -- and classes were held there. 
Q: Right. D-Do you remember when
 the Nazis came  in to the Netherlands?  When they ma rched 
in?  Do you have an -- 

A: No. 

Q: -- do you have any recollection? 

A: Ah, no, except that I did 
hear a lot of shooting. 
Q: You did. 
A: And because we had -- Amsterdam was at the 
time, a port at the [indecipherabl e] that little 
inland sea that -- that  the Netherlands has. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And it was a pretty big port, and well, if 
anything was happening ther
e, we could hear it. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: So we could hear very much shooting. And then
 that died down, and at first they we re very 
friendly, and then came one bulletin
 after another banning the Jews. 
Q: Had your uncle left by this time ?  Did he l
eave before the Germans came?  Your Uncle Sam?  
He had left. 

A: He had left. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
32 
 
 
Q: So he was lucky. 
A: Yes, he was. 

Q: Was he married at the time? 

A: Yes. 

Q: To your Aunt Anne, was that right?  So they 
were -- were -- were they both in the house with 

you? 

A: No. 

Q: They weren™t. 

A: He went first. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And she went later, and she has an adventure. You want to know? 

Q: She has a what?  An adventure? 

A: Wa s something happened. 
Q: Really? 
A: They were the last train out of Austria, th
ey we re the last people allowed to go out of the 
country. 

Q: Really? 

A: And they came to the Dutch quarter and they took them all out, and they were going to shoot 

them. Now, the border was ma rked off by -- what you have around the chicken coops, you 

know?  

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And my aunt saw a pl ace where she could pos
sibly go on the knees, but not very quickly, and 
the Dutch people pulled her over. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
33 
 
 
Q: Really? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: And did they shoot these other people? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Really?  Oh my. So did she come  alone? 

A: Yeah, she came alone. 

Q: I see, so she came separately from. Wo w.And when did you hear this story, when you came 

to the United States, or did you hear it -- 

A: Oh, we had been here some ti
me already when I heard that. 
Q: When you heard that, so 
you didn™t hear it when you we
re in the Netherlands -- 
A: Not then, no. 

Q: Not then, right. Okay. When the Nazis took over
 bef -- before you father unfortunately he was 
taken some how in 1942, but was -- wa s he arrested 
and then came  back and arrested a couple of 
times before this fi nal time? 

A: Well, they cloaked it all on th
e taxes, and my father got a no
tice that he owed some taxes. 
Q: He owed taxes. 

A: But -- well, among the taxes were also our radi
os. We  had to hand in th
e radios, and he went 
there, they talked to him and they let him go ba
c k. And they wanted him back the next day. And 
he told us, you better go under, because I 
don™t know if I™m comi ng back. He went. 

Q: He went back by himself. 

A: He went back by himself. 

Q: So nobody came to your house to take him away. 

A: No, he -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
34 
 
 
Q: He just went back. 
A: Yeah.  

Q: Why do you think -- who was he going to 
talk with?  With the Germans or Dutch? 
A: Yeah, Germans.  

Q: With Germans. And they were
 saying he hadn™t paid taxes? 
A: Yeah, or some thing. 

Q: Sounds odd, doesn™t it? 

A: Some -- some odd thing. 

Q: So did -- did the f -- his -- your mother, Ro
se, say to him, don™t go back?  Why are you going 
back?  Did some body say, don™t do it? 

A: I don™t know. 

Q: You don™t know. Did he say good-bye to
 you?  Do you remember that day? 
A: Yeah, but not -- not
 -- not an unusual -- 
Q: Did you know where he was going? 

A: Yes. 

Q: You did know. We re you scared? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Yeah. Cause by then you knew these guys were not good guys. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: So once he goes, you never see him again? 

A: No. And I never knew whether he was aliv
e or dead after the wa
r, until the Red Cross 
released some  report, and it turned out that he then died. 

Q: And whe r e -- where was he taken, do you -- did it say? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
35 
 
 
A: A part of Auschwitz. 
Q: Birkenau? Was it Birkenau? Was he in Wester
bork first?  Di d they bring him to We s t erbork 
and then he was deported from We st erbork. Bu
t you did not know that and your mot her didn't 
know it. Or do you not know whether your mother knew it? 

A: We  knew that he would go to We sterbork. 

Q: You did know that, because that™s where they were sending the Jews. 

A: That we knew. 

Q: Yes.  

A: And the brother of Ta nte Toos was in the 
underground and he had heard that they had took -- 
where they took my father. 

Q: Uh-huh. So did you -- your mother knew that 
before you did. Your mother must have known 
that when you were in hiding. You think? 

A: I-I was there when he told. 
Q: When he s -- so you knew too. 
A: Uh-huh. 

Q: When your father said I™m going to go and yo
u should get out, he was 
saying to his wife, your 
mother, take the kids -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- and leave.  

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: Go into hiding, yes? But you had no idea 
that there was a pr
eparation being -- 
A: No. 

Q: -- had -- preparations had been made for hiding. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
36 
 
 
A: No idea. 
Q: No idea at all. So is it very soon after your fa
ther goes and leaves and he
™s not there, that your 
mother says we™re going?  Does she do it right away? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Right away? 

A: Yes. 

Q: So what does she say to you?  I mean, what is it li
ke, is this in the e -- at night, is it in the 
morning, when -- when is it? 

A: Well, we went at dusk. We 
took our stars off because we were
n™t supposed to be on the street 
after dusk -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- at that time. I don™t reme mber even whethe
r we took the tram or walked all the way. She 
said we are going to Tante Toos
, we are going to stay there. 
Q: She did say that? 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: Did you know who Tante Toos was? 

A: Oh yeah. 

Q: Cause -- and you had -- you had met her? 

A: Yes, because I always went th -- bread with 
m -- with my mother, I went to the bakery that 
Tante Toos was ma naging at the 
time across, and ju -- it was right
 across the street from us. 
Q: I see. So you lived in that older apartment?  Ye
s, not -- not the one at Pi
eter Hooch?  Or did she 
-- di -- was her bakery near -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
37 
 
 
A: We ll, when we moved from the street wher
e we lived, where she had the bakery, we moved 
to a different  street. 
Q: Right. 

A: And so far as I know, they had no
 contact any more, but they did. 
Q: But they did. So they were cl
early very close in some  way in
 order to ma ke these kinds of 
plans. 

A: We ll, she was very grateful to my father, because she had worked for my father for ma ny, 

ma ny years. 

Q: I see. In his café? Is that where she worked? 

A: Yeah, like a li
ttle coffeehouse. 
Q: Uh-huh, right. 

A: You could get coffee and tea and pastry. 

Q: Right. 
A: And she had ma rried a ma n who was 25 years ol
der than she. He was in the militar y but he 
had done some thing bad, and he was out of it, and 
he was old, so she -- she was the breadwinner. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And whe n we went to the Piet
er de Hooch Strat, she became  
the ma na ger of a liquor store in 
an entirely different neighborhood. 

Q: Hm. But obviously they -- your mother and sh
e obviously had some thing in common in that 
they were both the breadwinners in their house. 

A: Yes. 

Q: Which in some  ways was unusual. 

A: Yes, they -- they were really pretty good friends, and -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
38 
 
 
Q: Really, yes. 
A: -- but there was a bond with my father 
because Tante Toos ha
d eight mi scarriages. 
Q: Eight?  

A: Yes. 

Q: Wo w. 

A: And each time she had to stay out of work. 

Q: Right. 

A: And m- my dad kept the job open for her each time. 

Q: Each time. 

A: And she was very grateful to him. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: That™s what did it. 

Q: So there were a lot of conn
ections with the family, yes.  
A: Yeah. 

Q: Huh. So you -- you reme mber that -- your mo
ther saying we™re going to Tante Toos. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: And did she have a bag that she took? 

A: Yes, we had a little bag, not -- nothing big. 

Q: Nothing big. We re you able to take some thing 
for yourself, or did she just grab the two kid -- 
the two of you, put on your coats, 
take off the Jewish stars -- 
A: I -- I could take a couple of things, a
nd I think that™s when I took my diaries. 
Q: Uh-huh. Cause by then you had been writing in them for a few years. 

A: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
39 
 
 
Q: Right, for three years or four years. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Yes. 

A: And wa -- then I was supposed to go to Tant
e Toos™s sister and brother-in-law who lives 
nearby. 

Q: Right. 

A: But they lived on the third fl oor in a small ap
artment and I was to stay with them. But after a 
few weeks they -- they got cold feet and they 
said, ﬁ We don™t -- we can™t keep you here because 
there is no pl ace to hide you anywhere.ﬂ So in th
e dark one ni ght, Oome  Cor, we called him, he 
took me  to Tante Toos. 

Q: We  have to change the tape.

Beginning Ta pe Three 
Q: Let™s see, I think I™ve been c
onfusing some  things. I think that
 I said that it was Uncle Sam 
who ca me  to stay with you, but it™s not Uncle Sam,
 it™s Uncle Alfred, is that right?  So it™s Alfred 
Schwartz, who is the brother of your mother, w
ho came to stay with you, and then with whom 
you stayed when you came to the United States, is that correct? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Okay. So when you go with your mother 
and Hedy, your sister, you -- you don™t reme mber 
whether you walked or whether 
you took a tram to Tante Toos? 
A: Oh, they lived close by, we walked. 

Q: You walked. It was close by, I see. 

A: I mean, when I went from Oome  Cor 
to Tante Toos, we definitely walked. 
Q: Yes, but now I™m talking about wh
en you first went to Ta nte Toos -- 
A: Toos -- 
Q: -- from your house, do you re -- do you have
 a recollection whether you were walking, or 
whether you -- 

A: I have a -- a hunch that we 
were walking because then, if we
 would have taken the tram, we 
would have been more visible. 

Q: Uh-huh, right, right.  

A: It was far, but I think we -- we walked. 

Q: You think you walked. 

A: Because we didn™t wa nt 
to attract any attention. 

Q: Attention. Now let me ask you some thing, when
 you -- you had to wear a star on your outer 
clothing and on your clothing, it™s -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
41 
 
 
A: No.  
Q: -- just on your coats? 

A: On -- on -- 

Q: On the arm?  

A: Yeah, arm. 

Q: What was that like for you when -- when 
that fi rst started, when you were walking? 
A: Awful. 

Q: It was awful. 

A: And that™s when I got in touch with anti-Semitism, because I had the other chum in school 

who was not Jewish. Her father also took her to
 school, and her father 
and my father became  
friends, and we became friends, too. And after the 
star, she came to tell me that she couldn™t 
walk with me any more, that her parents didn™t wa
nt her to walk with me  any more because of 
that st ar. 
Q: What did you think? 
A: Terribl e. 

Q: It was awful, huh? 

A: That was hard.  

Q: Did she feel bad, too, or did sh
e just stat e, well this is what my
 parents say, this is what I have 
to -- you don™t know, or y -- 

A: I couldn™t tell. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: I couldn™t tell.  

Q: And you were 14 at the time. Wa s 1942, with the star -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
42 
 
 
A: When I went into hiding. 
Q: No, but when you -- when the s -- wh
en you first have to wear the star. 

A: Oh, I don™t remember . 

Q: Re me mb er. I think it was ™42. 
So you™re -- you™re not a kid. Y
ou are -- I mean, you™re a kid in 
a certain way. 

A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: But you™re not a child child -- 

A: No. 

Q: -- you™re -- you™re -- if it was 1942, so you™re 
14 years old. So that was really hard on you, 
cause you™re very conscious of
 who you are as a young person. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Did anybody else do that to you? 

A: No. 
Q: And whe n you were walking on the street, 
and you had the Jewish star, people stare? 
A: No. 
Q: No, they didn™t. So did the Dutch 
treat you in a o-okay way as far as -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: They did. Except for that one incident. 

A: Yeah. There were a couple of h-home s that th
e Germans had occupied and the so -- some  of 
the Soviets were sitting outside 
in the front yard and I would pa
ss with my star, and they would 
whistle at me. 

Q: They would whistle. What™d you ma ke
 of that?  It™s a little stran -- 
A: They were very young ones, 
very young soldiers, all of them. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
43 
 
 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: [indecipherable] 

Q: So did you think they were whistling at
 you because you were a young, attractive girl? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Not because you were wearing the star. 

A: No, no, I don™t even think they saw the star. 

Q: I see. So they were on your street? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Yuck, that must have been horrible. 

A: Oh, it was. 

Q: Yeah. So were you nervous when your mother
 took off the star that night when you were 
going to walk to Tante Toos? 

A: Mm-h m.  
Q: And -- and think that 
you were very vulnerable? 
A: Mm-h m. Yes.  
Q: Did you have baptisma l papers, I mean did your mother have some  false papers for you? 

A: No. 

Q: So if she was stopped, they would have known you were Jewish. 

A: Yes. 

Q: Did you have an identity card -- 

A: No. 

Q: -- that had a J in it?  No.  

A: No. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
44 
 
 
Q: So there was nothing -- 
A: No. 

Q: -- in Holland. 

A: No identity card. 

Q: Nothing. So when -- when you got to Tante T
oos and you walked in, did you feel, i-if you can 
reme mber, did you feel more secure, not secure
, because you knew who this person wa s, and you 
felt safer, or did -- 

A: And the set up was better, too. 

Q: Excuse me, the -- 

A: The set up. 

Q: The set up? 

A: Yes. Because we coul d know beforehand when
 somebody was home to come. She -- the front 
of the house was the store, the back of the hous
e was a little bedroom and living room, kitchen. 
Q: Right, right. 

A: And the front of the store starts here, and ju
st there was the door to the baseme nt. So when 
some body c a me , we quietly went through that door. 

Q: To the baseme nt, uh-huh. 

A: And whe n the store was closed, 
we could come  in the living room. 
Q: You could? 

A: Yes, we could, unless a neighbor upstairs 
was always going to shave Uncle John. Did Hedy 
tell you exactly who Uncle John was? 

Q: No, tel -- you tell me . He was -- he was Tante Toos™s husband. 

A: He was her husband, he was the 25 year over husband -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
45 
 
 
Q: Right. 
A: -- who had done some thing. But he  was from 
-- somehow from the nobility, and his first wife 
came to visit him every week. 

Q: Really? 

A: And of c ourse his first wife, she was also 
from the [indecipherable] and she was not supposed 
to know, so Jewish -- 

Q: Wa s not supposed to know that you were there? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Yes. 

A: So that was a whole day for us in the baseme nt for sure.  

Q: Wa s there a toilet in the baseme nt
, or nothing? No. So you had to just -- 
A: Cha mber pot. 

Q: Cha mber pot. So you™re 14, and Hedy is -- 
A: Six. 
Q: Six. So she™s -- how does sh -- how is she in
 this circumstance? I m
ean, she™s a -- a kid who 
must be noisy, or you know, wants to play. 

A: She was very good. 

Q: She was. 

A: It was unbelieva ble because before, she was a brat. 

Q: She was? 

A: And after fi -- after things so
rt of norma lized in this States, she came a brat for a little while 
longer. 

Q: But she was not a brat when you were in hiding? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
46 
 
 
A: No. 
Q: So she must have understood how -- 

A: She must have. 

Q: -- how -- how dangerous it was. So talk aboutsome thing of what it was like to be -- could you 

go outside? 

A: No. 

Q: No, you had to stay inside. 

A: Yes. 

Q: So nobody around could know that you were there. 

A: No. 

Q: That mus t  have been very 
hard. Was like being in prison. 
A: Yeah. [indecipherable] 

Q: But -- but nicer, cause people -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- were nice to you. Ta nte Toos was taking a big risk, wasn™t she? 

A: Yes, she was.  

Q: Why do you think she did it? 

A: Out of loyalty to my father. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: She was very grateful that 
he kept the job open for her -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- through eight mi scarriages. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
47 
 
 
Q: Right. But still, this is a time when you know 
that the Nazis are ther
e, this is extremely 
dangerous. Now when - -  wh-when you left her -- it™
s her sister and brother-i
n-law, or her brother 
and sister -- 
A: Her sister and brother-in-law. 

Q: And brother-in-law. When they brought you back, 
was she aggravated with them, or did sh -- 
and -- or did she just welcome you and say okay, 
so it™s three people in
stead of two people? 
A: We ll, she welcomed me  but reluctantly, becau
se that was not the way it was supposed to be. 
Q: Right, right. So she was better
 than the sister, wasn™t she? 
A: Yes. 

Q: But of course her circumstances were such that there was 
a place for you to hide, whereas 
there wasn™t a place -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: Yes. 
A: Mm-h m.  
Q: But you spoke fluent Dutch. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Did you look Jewish? 

A: We ll, when I was in grade school, some
 people thought I looked 
Indian or Spanish. 
Q: Spanish. 

A: But I don™t think I looked outspoken -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- dut -- Jewish. 

Q: Or different th
an the other kids. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
48 
 
 
A: Yeah. No, not -- 
Q: And wha t  -- who were you supposed to be when
 you went to her sister™s, were you supposed 
to be -- I mean, if somebody came and visited 
and they saw you, were you supposed to be a 

relative? I mean, who were you 
supposed to be?  Did you know? 
A: No. 

Q: No, you don™t know. Did you have the same  name
, or were you given another name when you 
were in hiding? 

A: No. 

Q: You weren™t given another name? 

A: No. 

Q: So you didn™t have
 any other papers. 

A: No 

Q: So you were there without papers, you were
 just there?  Okay. So what was it like? 
A: [indecipherable] 

Q: No, what was it like, what was it like
 to be in hiding th
ere. Was -- was -- 
A: Not good. 

Q: Was it -- 

A: I -- I -- I felt like -- 
you know, I was 14, I was going to go to
 the second grade in gymnasium,  
and we were all getting friendl
y, the whole class was Jewish a
nd Christian and -- and I had my 
Jewish chum still, and -- no, I didn™t have her th
en, she was already gone. One time I went to see 
her. 

Q: This was a friend? 

A: She was really my bosom friend. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
49 
 
 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: We  were always together. I went up there to
 see her, she lived on th
e third floor, across from 
the grade school. And the neighbors 
across the hall came  out and told me  that she was picked up 
by the Germans. 

Q: So she was taken to Westerbor
k probably, and then deported. So 
that must have been really 
awful for you. 

A: I had [indecipherable] a cousin for awhile
, who was in the underground. She was walking 
around with false papers and blonde colored ha
ir. She some how knew a person who was related 
to the math professor in gymnasium.  And this
 relative wrote a book on the students who all had 
to go to that quickly established Jewish school. A
nd he did a lot of research and -- with another 
author. I should have brought the book. And he 
found out that she was ki
lled in Auschwitz. Me -
- I still didn™t know until I got that book -- 

Q: Right. Is this Presser? 
A: -- from him.  
Q: Is this Jacques Presser,
 is that the professor? 
A: Jacques Presser, no that -- J
acques was the history professor. 
Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh. But you had him as a professor, yes? 

A: Oh yeah. Oh, did I adore him. 

Q: Yes. 

A: How do you know his name ?  

Q: Because he wrote a book about Dutch Jews and the war. 

A: Oh. 

Q: So you had him as a professor? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
50 
 
 
A: He was fantastic. 
Q: Really? 

A: Because history is di fficult 
to teach, and he ma de it come  alive for us, he  brought -- he 
brought pictures. He was talking at the time about
 Greek and Roma n architecture, which can be 

boring. 

Q: Right. 

A: Ah, no, we got the pictures and he showed us
 the difference in -- little differences in 
architecture. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: And then we had our workbook, and 
then we pasted in this thing -- 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- and you had to write some thing next to it. 

Q: Right. 
A: And it was fun. 
Q: Right. 

A: And he was nice. He was very nice. 

Q: Uh-huh. So this -- this happens, 
of course, before you go into hiding. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: So you go into hidi ng and stop school because
 you go into hiding. Or -- or di d school stop 
before you went into hiding? 

A: No, the school -- and that™s ex
actly what this relative of th
e other [indecipherable] rema ined, 
only the classes became smaller and smaller and smaller. 

Q: I see. And is it -- does -- 
is this the Jewish school? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
51 
 
 
A: Yes. 
Q: Yes. 

A: This is where the Jewi sh -- 

Q: Jews. 

A: -- children from all of Amsterdam were put together. 

Q: Right, and it become s smaller and smaller because they deport more and more -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- kids, right. Did you know Tante 
Toos™s son before you went -- 

A: No. 

Q: You didn™t. So you didn't know she had a son? 

A: No. 

Q: So he is what, 19 and you™re 14 
when you first come  there, right? 

A: Yes. 
Q: Is he in the underground? 
A: No. 

Q: He™s not. But he has a radio. 
Is there a radio in the house? 
A: Yes, there was. 

Q: There was. So that was not c
onfiscated. They kept their radio. 
A: Yeah, but they 
we re  Chr i s t ia ns . 
Q: So they never confiscated radios fr om Christians? 

A: No. 

Q: So did you listen to that radio? 

A: Yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
52 
 
 
Q: And did you hear war news? 
A: Yes, I heard Churchill. 

Q: You heard Churchill from the BBC. Did you understand English? 

A: No, I don™t think so. 

Q: You don™t think so. 

A: Just a little. 

Q: So did Hans understand English? 

A: Yes. 

Q: So he would tell you what Churchill was sa ying? 

A: Yes. 

Q: And did you follow the war by putting -- 

A: Yes. Hans did. 

Q: -- pins on a ma p?  
A: Hans did that. 
Q: Hans did.  

A: He put the ma p on the wall and -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- we put the pins th
en as the war went on. 
Q: Did you think the war was going to last as 
long as it did?  Or did you think it would be 
shorter?  

A: For a long time I thought it would be 
shorter. But when it dragged on -- 
Q: Yeah. 

A: -- up until the time of the 
invasion, I thought I don™t know how long this is going to -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
53 
 
 
Q: Right, right.  
A: But when they invaded France, that was when
 my mother died. When they invaded France, 
Mother died right on that day, 
that night, but at the same  tim
e everybody began to get a little 
more hope that that war -- 

Q: Would be over, right. 

A: -- would end soon. 

Q: Right. Did you hear rumors about what the Nazi
s were doing, that they
 were killing people? 
A: Yes, yes. 

Q: You did? 

A: Yes.  

Q: And wha t  sort of rumors did you hear? 

A: Well, Uncle Cor brought most of t he rum -- th
e news and Uncle Cor also brought us our false 
food stamps. We  -- we would -- everybody get a 
food stamp card each week, and these -- so 
ma ny sta mps for milk and so ma ny for meat, 
etcetera. He would get a set for us -- 
Q: That -- that were 
false [indecipherable] 

A: But I -- di -- I don™t know how he  got it or
 -- but it was through the underground. And Tante 
Toos could take them and buy food for us. 

Q: And did anybody question that th
ere must be more people in th
e house, or they just didn™t? 
A: The neighbor, I found out later, the 
neighbor upstairs who came to shave. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: He did.  

Q: He questioned it. 

A: I think he had seen us s
lip, or somebody™s back, or -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
54 
 
 
Q: But he didn™t say anything to the Germans?  
A: No, no. 

Q: No. 

A: No. A -- Tante Toos had anot
her brother-in-law, who did see 
us, and that was about in the 
March before they invaded. He -- he had a long talk
 with Tante Toos, telling her to get rid of us 
and why, and how, and how the consequences, 
and -- he was trying to get rid of us. 
Q: But she wouldn™t do it. 

A: No.  

Q: So what was she like? 

A: I hardly knew him.  

Q: No, her. Tante Toos. 

A: Tante Toos? 

Q: Yes, what was she like? 
A: She was unique. She was -- how can I say that?  
In London there is a --
 a neighborhood that™s 
called Cockney or some thing? 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: We ll, so in Amsterdam there is a neighborhood 
that™s called the Jordaan, 
and they have also a 
slightly different -- which she 
was originally from the Jordaan, and because she had all this 
business experience she -- she didn™t ha
ve that language with her any more. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: But we -- the swearing words -- 

Q: She did. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
55 
 
 
A: -- she kept. And she [indecipherable] was very
 loyal to my dad and she was a happy person, 
an optimistic person, and some body who liked to
 ma ke a joke, even a off color joke. 
Q: Right. 
A: And so she -- she was an 
up person, most of the time. 
Q: And as you reme mbe r  it, how did she get alon
g with your mother?  Your mother seems as if 
she™s a very different kind of person than Ta
nte Toos. And the friendship seems al-almost odd. 
A: We ll, it wasn™t really odd. 

Q: No?  

A: They only put -- because they didn™t live together -- 

Q: Yes 

A: -- they we re -- they we re really good friends
. But on living together, th
is thing deteriorated. 

Q: It did. 

A: My mother was the -- the head of the household. 
Q: Right. 
A: She was the hausfrau. Then she had to go in a 
little place and do what this lady sa id, eat what 
this lady brought. 

Q: So she didn't like it. So they didn™t get along very well. 

A: No. 

Q: Did they fight? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Did they argue? 

A: Yeah. They would get very bad. 

Q: Really?  And they never were able 
to work it out?  It was always -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
56 
 
 
A: No, that -- it came worse.  
Q: It -- in what way does it -- it -- it -- you mean
 the -- there -- they became  less and less friends 
as the time went on, not more and more. So that
 must have made it very difficult for you and 
your sister living in that sort 
of circumstance. Did -- did you ta ke sides, do you think, in your 
head?  And you were on the side of Tante Toos? Yes. And you feel a litt
le guilty about that? 
A: Yes. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Yes. 

Q: But do you now, as you look back as an a
dult person, do you think she was right, or your 

mother was right, or ther
e™s no right and wrong here? 

A: Well, it™s diffi cult to say exactly who was right
. It was understandable 
that my mot her would 
not feel so happy. 

Q: Right. 
A: Because she wa -- used to be the boss -- 
Q: Yes. 

A: -- and she wasn't  any more. 

Q: Right. 

A: And she™d lost her husband, of course. 

Q: So it was all very difficult for her. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Yes. And she wasn™t working, of c
ourse, so that ma de it even worse. 
A: Yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
57 
 
 
Q: But what was -- did she bring money into 
the house?  She must have brought mo -- some  
money that she had so she could help out -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- with Ta nte Toos, yes?  But you also said
 that you didn't bring things with you, but she 
hoarded food. So was there food in Tante Toos™s
 house, that™s -- so the food had been brought 
there, it was ready. And what
 kind of food could you -- 
A: Rice. 

Q: Ah, staples that didn™t need refrigeration. 

A: Jam. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Tea. 

Q: What? 

A: Tea. 
Q: Tea. Ah. 
A: Coffee, flour. 

Q: Intere sting. 

A: That™s about all. 

Q: Right. 

A: But there was a lot of it. 

Q: There was. So it lasted a long time? 

A: Yes.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
58 
 
 
Q: You -- you started a kind of a relationshi p that became very serious with Hans at a certain 
point, is that right? 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: Wh- Whe n did that start?  After you were th
ere six months, a year?  Cause you were there for 
three years. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: At least during the war, and then -- then fo
r another year, or almost a year, yes? When you 
were 15, when you were 16, what do you think? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Yeah? 

A: Yeah, and we both realized that
 Hedy was not getting any schooling. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And we tried, between him and me
, to get Hedy ready for school -- 
Q: Huh. 

A: -- so that she, when she came out woul
dn™t have to start at class number one -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- but she could put right aw
ay, and -- and she was ready. 
Q: Really? 

A: So she didn™t lose  time because we  had tutored her. 

Q: That™s fabulous. Did you have books?  Did you ha
ve some  books, or did you just ma ke it up as 
you went along? 

A: I had some  French textbooks
, but I think Hans had a fe
w grade school textbooks left. 
Q: Did you like doing that?  Wa  -- di -- 
I mean, it gave you some thing to do. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
59 
 
 
A: Mm-h m.  
Q: And you enjoyed that and -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Did that bring you and 
Hans closer together? 
A: No. 

Q: No. 

A: No. The fact is that Tante Toos did like to ma
ke a white lie. Nothing serious, but if -- if my 
mother asked her, could you get fi
sh today, and she had just a lit
tle bit, she would say no, I don™t 
have any fish for today.  

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Little things like that. And Ha
ns began to notice it. That™s wh
at brought him closer. He didn™t 
like that. 

Q: I see. So you became closer together. 
A: Mm-h m.  
Q: We  need to stop the tape. 
End of Tape Three 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
60 
 
 
Beginning Ta pe Four 
Q: Okay, Betsy, when -- when we left the last 
tape, you were talking abou
t Hans realizing that 
his mother told white lies. 
A: Yes. 

Q: And that this bothered him, and that this
 brought you closer toge
ther. Can you explain why 
that brought you closer together? 

A: We ll, we also had in common that we were te
aching my sister. That was all at the same  ti me , 

and it was shortly after my moth
er died. You know, my mother 
died while we were hidden. 
Q: Yes, I was going to ask you about -- right. So this
 -- this happened afterwar
ds. So let™s -- let™s 
go back then, and talk first about your mother. 
Was your mother ill when you went into hiding? 
A: No, but she -- she wasn't  ill, but di d th --  before  she died, she had these terrible headaches, 

and they became  worse and worse and worse and 
worse. And Tante Toos knew a doctor from the 
underground, but we were all hoping, well, let™
s see how it goes thr
ough the night. And then, 
during the night, she expired. And th
is particular doctor, he saw to
 it that she got a grave at the 
Jewish cemetery near Amsterdam.  

Q: Really? 

A: We ll he must have, because there she is. 
And not only is she, but my grandmother and 
grandfather, they™re there too. And I have no id
ea who -- there must have
 been several people 
involved, to get her there. 

Q: We re your grandparents then 
-- they died in Amsterda m? 
A: Yes. 

Q: They were not deported? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
61 
 
 
A: The -- a -- in -- in Amsterdam and there -- 
it --  it™s not certai n whet
her they got sick or 
whether the Germans hit them, or -- nobody knows ex
actly what happened. But they are now in 
the [indecipherable] cemetery by Amst erda m, right next
 to my mo m.  
Q: And your -- your mother died in 1944, 
right? Is that right?  You were bef -- 
A: Yeah. My mother died on the ni
ght that the allies invaded Nor mandy. 
Q: Really? 
A: That night. 

Q: This mus t  have been a big shock to you to
 lose your mother. Now -- now you -- you lost both 

parents.  

A: Yeah, I woke up, my sister and I, we sleepin
g in one bed. I woke up and felt my mother was 
too quiet and I felt her hand and it wa s ice cold, 
of course. So I started screaming, oh Hedy, now 
we are whatyoumacalls, pe
ople without parents. 

Q: An orphan. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: So you discovered that your mother was dead? 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: She was sleeping in the same  room with the two of you?  

A: Right next to us, actually. 

Q: Right next to you. Hm. Now, you didn't have a 
funeral, you were not -- they did -- they take 
the body away, right? 

A: No. No. And that same  doctor, he arranged th
at her body was carried out
 and he really did a 
great deal. 

Q: He did.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
62 
 
 
A: Because he knew pretty soon -- pr etty early 
that we were there. Yeah. I don™t know who knew 
him, but evidently Tante Toos trusted him.  
Q: So this was very -- very 
quick, di z -- whatever this was -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- in your mother, it wa s -- it went very fast. 

A: He si -- he thinks it wa s a -- a tumor in the brain. 

Q: Mm-hm. Had she had headaches for a long time that you reme mber? 

A: She always had some  headache. 

Q: She always had it, uh-huh. 

A: But nothing unusual. 

Q: But this --  these were really extreme, painful? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Now, in relationship to when she died, prio
r to her dying, there was 
a secondary hiding place 
inside the apartment, right? There was a -- 
some sort of a false wall that was built. 
A: Yes. 

Q: How long before your mother died?  Because she 
was there and hiding in that place with you. 

A: Yes. 

Q: Right?  Was that a year before?  Do you 
reme mb -- do you have any recollection?   
A: I™d say half a year before, but I don™t know exactly. 

Q: Right. 

A: Like I -- I don™t know, Hedy said there 
was a hiding place underneath the -- the window 
where they displayed the bottles of gin, and whatev
er. Tho -- she said that was at first designated 
as our hidi ng place, but I don™t recognize th
is at all, I don™t reme mber seeing -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
63 
 
 
Q: Right. Well, do you reme mber this otherhi ding place where this false wall was -- 
A: Oh yes. 

Q: You do? 

A: Oh -- oh yes, we were all in there, Hans too. 

Q: And why  was Hans there? 

A: Hans was in there because the Germans wanted
 to have boys come  to Germany and work in 
the factories. And Hans went to some kind of
 -- because he wanted to become a telegraph 
operator at sea, so he went to
 school for that, and that was 
one reason why he was still around, 
but when they did go around, they would pick up 
these boys and send them to the factories in 
Germany. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: So there were -- there was mother and my si ster and Hans and I in a very small place. 

Q: You would ha -- you would -- where was this in
side the a -- the apartment?  You™ve described 
that behi nd the store was the living space. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: So what -- was it on that floor, that 
same floor as the -- as the stor e was? 
A: Yes. Actually, there was a kitchen, and theceiling was that high. Right
 next to the kitchen 
was the bathroom, and the ceiling was much, much higher. And so they built a fa lse wall. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: From the  ceiling of ba
throom, which was higher. 

Q: So how much space is there? 

A: Maybe two and a half feet by four feet. I can™
t think of it now, I™m ge tting mi xed up with the -
- I -- I forgot how to copulate cu -- how ma ny cubi
c feet those are. It™s small, extremely small. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
64 
 
 
Q: Could you sit, or di
d you have to stand? 
A: We  could sit, but we have
 to pull up our legs and -- 
Q: And how ma ny hours would you stay there, usually? 
A: It differed. Some time s  only half an hour
, and some ti me s two and a half hours.  

Q: And this was when -- when you would be 
warned that -- that Germans were comi ng? 
A: Yes, mm-hm.  

Q: And once the Germans were gone, then you could come  out? 

A: Yeah.  

Q: And do you know who would warn Tante Toos
 that some body was comi ng?  Do you have any 
idea? 

A: It mi ght be Uncle Cor, I mean, that was he
r closest link to the unde
rground. But it mi ght also 
have been word of mouth. I -- I couldn™t tell you. 

Q: Right. Was Hans connected with th
e underground at all as time went on? 
A: No. 
Q: He wasn™t? 

A: No. 

Q: Not at all. 

A: He was not. 

Q: Did you fall in love with him? 

A: Yeah, I did. 

Q: You did. 

A: I thought I did. 

Q: And now you think it wasn™t that? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
65 
 
 
A: Mm-h m.  
Q: Why?  

A: We ll, we were pretty close 
together and at that age, what do they call it?  Puppy love.  
Q: Mm. And so that™s what you think it was? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: But this must have been good for you in some way?  No? 

A: No, it wasn™t. 

Q: Oh, it wasn™t. 

A: Because a-at that time, he
 didn™t fall in love with me. 
Q: Uh-huh.  

A: We were close fr iends, but he didn't  fall in love with me until after the war. He had the close 

friend who came, and he paid attention to me , an
d Hans became  jealous. And then Hans decided 
he was in love with me , and 
we were going to get ma rried. 
Q: You were? 

A: Yeah. Hans was going to get the job at sea, 
and then he™d pick me  up, and then get ma rried, 
and I™d be in Amsterdam. But just the fact that 
he was at sea, he wrote 
me  pretty soon that he 
saw a girl in Ha mburg, and they were 
going to get ma rried. And that was that. 
Q: And that was the end. So he wrote -- this is
 after the war, he  wrot
e to you and said this? 
A: Yeah. For a long time he wrote almost like 
we are going to get ma rried. I me an, that was 
really the real thing, 
but then suddenly came th
at letter that --  
Q: I see.  

A: And he saw this girl in Ha mburg. 

Q: But you rema ined in love with him for -- you were pretty constant? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
66 
 
 
A: Yeah, I was pretty constant. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: I was pretty constant, but I wa
s -- but his friend wa
s really the better on
e, only at the time I 
didn™t realize it. 

Q: His friend was better for you? 

A: His friend was better for me  than Hans. 

Q: Than Hans, uh-huh. 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: Wa s he your first boyfriend? 

A: You could say that. When I was still in schoo
l, there was a mi nister living upstairs with his 
fa mily and he took in borders, me dical student
s a lot. And he had a nephew comi ng in who was 
my age. And nephew and I talked a 
little bit about things. That  -- th
at was the closest I came to a 
boyfriend -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- at that  time. 

Q: Right. Now that your mother is no longer aliv
e, is -- does Tante Toos become  a -- a mother 
figure for the two of you, or do you become  the mo
ther of Hedy at this point?  I me an, what -- 
what -- what happens now that
 your mother is not there? 
A: My father had always said, if something ha
ppens to everybody, that I 
should take care of my 
little sister. Tante Toos felt th
at she was the mother, and it 
made her feel good. And -- and Hedy 
responded very -- very well to her,
 but it was I who had to take 
her to the doctor, it was I who 
had to go downtown with her, get her new clothe
s, and she get her shoes repolished. I was really 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
67 
 
 
closer so far as care giving is concerned. And Tant
e Toos was -- she gave us a roof over our head 
and food to eat. 
Q: But now you™re talking about the time when
 the war is over, when you can leave. I™m 
wondering before the war is over -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: And you™re still in the house -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- and you can™t go out. 

A: No, not yet, and half an -- about 
four months later, Uncle John died. 
Q: Uh-huh, after your mother. 

A: Yeah, after my mothe r .  

Q: I see. 

A: Wa s very short, yeah. We  lost
 two people. But Uncle John was old. 
Q: Wa s old. How old do you think he was? 

A: I think he was 82, and was very much paralyzed -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- by strokes. 

Q: Right. 

A: And he couldn™t speak very well, and he ha
d to be helped to bed, and to the bathroom. 
Q: I see. 

A: And f -- we fed [indecipherable] 

Q: Did -- did you spend time with him as well, or not? 

A: We ll, he was always 
sitting in hi s chair. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
68 
 
 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: So when we came to the living room to eat, he was there. 

Q: I see. 

A: He was always there when we we re in th
e living room, although on a one to one relationship 
with him, I think none of us had. 

Q: Uh-huh. And was he the -- the only husband of Ta
nte Toos?  This is -- this is the father of 
Hans?  So it™s not -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And Hans has -- had two half brothers from th
at first wife. Two half brothers and one half 
sister, and the half sister -- the 
brothers were caught in the Dutch East Indies. They were caught 
by the Japanese. And the [indeciphera
ble] sist er, she lived in the ci
ty not too far, and she also 
came to visit Tante Toos. 
Q: Hm. Oka y. So when -- when you were in th
e house, a-again, now that the -- Ta nte Toos™s 
husband is dead, and your mother is dead, does sh
e become  more of a mo
t her figure inside the 
house, or she rema ins the same  for you? 
A: She rema ins the same . 

Q: She rema ins the same . And do you begin to ta
ke even more care of Hedy even though you™re 
-- you™re in the house?  Is that difficult for you?  
I mean, you™re now -- how 
old are you?  You™re 
16 in 1944, and she™s eight. That™s a big res
ponsibility as a 16 year old, isn™t it?   
A: Yeah. 

Q: Did you resent it? 

A: No. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
69 
 
 
Q: No. 
A: No. Because she -- she was not a brat at th
e time , and she realized what was going on. And on 
top of that, after the war, when she went to
 school, she became very ill with whooping cough and 
pneumonia, and she had to spend several months 
in the hospital, several months before it all 
cleared up, because we were all undernourished. 

Q: Yes. That -- was that last 
year a very difficult year because it was such a bad winter in 1944 
and ™45 -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- in -- in -- in the Netherlands? 

A: Yes, it was a very bad year because the German
s, as they withdrew, to
ok all the food from the 
far mers, everything they could. And all -- all th
e art that they could find, and some ti mes they 
burned houses behind them as they withdrew. A
nd we were isolated. Wh atever food there was 

went to the German ar my. 
Q: So how did you get food?  What did you eat? 
A: We  got one little loaf of 
bread, from whatever that was 
ma de we don™t know. And ma ybe two 
potatoes. 

Q: This is a week? 

A: And that -- but Tante Toos 
had connections, you see, and she had connections with people 
who sold eel, smoked eel, which is a delicacy 
in Holland, and with pe
ople who ha -- had the 
pastry shop. And ma ybe a baker. Couple of people th
at she changed then her 
little bit of gin or 
whatever it was, because she got less, 
too, she exchanged it then for food.  
Q: Was she still getting these ration --  with this fa
ke ration books, so she could use it, or was that 
not even done any more? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
70 
 
 
A: After the war I don™t think we had them any more. 
Q: But it still went throughout
 -- until the war was over? 
A: Oh yes. 

Q: Yes. 

A: Yes. 

Q: But it became harder and harder -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- to [indecipherable] food. Do you 
-- do you reme mber being very hungry? 
A: No. 

Q: No. 

A: No. Actually, when I came in there, and I had 
to stay in the house, like [indecipherable] I got 
very heavy, and when there was not so much fo
od, my weight dropped, and I was not sorry. But 

I didn™t realize that I was undernourished. 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: It came out later on in different ways, but no I 
didn™t really feel -- that the worst feeling was 
of being isolated, knowing that the other kids 
were growing up and goi
ng through the classes, 
and seeing the wa -- the profe
ssors, and social life, and it was out. I didn™t have it. 
Q: So you fe lt deprived? 

A: I felt very much deprived that way. Of course
 I mi ssed my father, too. We  were very close. 
Yeah, I felt out of
 it, you know?   
Q: You felt out of it?  But around you, you were 
seeing a s -- a -- a kind 
of norma lcy of the non-
Jews -- 

A: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
71 
 
 
Q: -- of those wh-who were not being oppressed. Do
 you think it was so easy for them?  Or that it 
was more n -- it was norma l, what -- in other 
words, the people who weren™t hiding like you, 
were they living a more norma l life as fa
r as you were you concerned?  Do you think? 
A: We ll, not a hundred percent. Socially they were. 
Q: Mm. 

A: That™s what I was thi -- I felt 
isolated from the other kids -- 
Q: Kids. 

A: -- who were growing up, 
who were going classes. 

Q: Right. 

A: Going out together, had picnics together, 
and got to know people, and here I was.  
Q: Alone. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Did you -- in ™44, given what you were hearin
g on the radio, did you think the war would be 
over soon?  

A: Yes. 

Q: And then it wo -- then it seemed
 sure that it would be over? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Yeah, people have great hopes. That™s why it
 was so difficult in the wintertime when there 
was no food, and people had hope. Some how the Re
d Cross in Sweden could get airplanes over 

Holland and throw down white bread, a couple of
 times, during that bad time . How they got 
there, I don™t know. Wa s dangerous. But -- and even af
ter the war, they helped us out with white, 
good bread. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
72 
 
 
Q: Do you reme mber the Nazis leaving the Netherlands? 
A: No. 

Q: You don™t. 

A: No, all I knew was that we didn™t hear any 
more stories about them. And toward the end 
there, there was -- well, Tante Toos says come
 out on the street, that is very quiet, is nobody 
here. A-And that must have been May the fourth
, or some thing like that. So we went out on the 
street, it was quiet, no tanks, no 
heavy footsteps, those German 
ma rching footsteps. And it was 
just uncanny. So that™s when we knew there are some thing going on. 

Q: And it -- obviously they seemed not 
to be there, so some thing was up. 
A: They seemed not to be there any more. 

Q: Yeah, yeah. We  have to change the tape. 

A: Yeah. 
End of Tape Four 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
73 
 
 
Beginning Ta pe Five 
Q: Betsy, could you re-describe th
e scene when Tante to -- Toos 
says it™s clear, there™s n -- 
there™s nobody here, come  out. What 
-- what did -- what is it that
 you see?  Do other people start 
comi ng out? 
A: Mm-h m.  

Q: So describe the scene that you -- that you reme mber. 

A: Well, it™s tra --  it™s a very
 wide street in a newer -- ne 
-- at that time , newer part of 
Amsterdam.  And there are s-stores all on the firs
t floor, and apartments on 
top of the store. And 
people came out of the doors [indecipherable] talk
ing to each other, ex
changing news. There™s 
one thing that happened during the 
war that I think that it ma de me  a whol e different person. The 

Germans we re going through that to
wn again, looking for Jews, and th
ey were in our street th -- 
for the first time . And we were about two houses 
-- two stores away from the end of the block. 
So they came from the other side and searched all the houses, and when they reached the end of 
the block before ours, they stopped, they
 were finished. They went home.  
Q: They just left? 
A: We ll, that was not yet when they withdrew, I mean -- 

Q: Right, right. 

A: -- they we re still doing their jobs. 

Q: Right. But they didn™t come  to your street. 

A: They didn't  come  to that bl
ock. Now, I think that™s a wonder. 
Q: And wha t  was the street name d that you were
 hiding on. What were --
 were -- were Tante 
Toos living? 

A: Jan Svertsenstraat. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
74 
 
 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: Mm-h m.  

Q: And that was in this --  in the -- the new -- 

A: Newer. 

Q: Newer part of Amsterdam.  

A: Of Amsterdam.  

Q: Is that in the south of Amsterdam?  

A: Southwest. 

Q: Southwest. So when are you sure that the Germans are gone? 

A: I think the ships in the harbor, they starte
d blowing the horns. And at
 -- that -- that was 
announced over the radio.  

Q: So do you reme mber feeling relieved? 

A: Yes, sure. But you know, I thought how wonderful, 
the war is over. It was a terrible war, now 
we are always going to have peace. 
That™s what I really thought.  
Q: It™s understandable. You™ve 
been disappointed, I would gather
, yes. Wh at did you thi -- what 
was one of the first things that you did?  Did Ta
nte Toos want to adopt you when the war was 
over?  Did you s -- did you speak about 
staying with her, or -- or what? 
A: This is a long story. Again, we 
hadn™t talked about it. It was -- 
we were going to stay with her 
until we went to Uncle Alfr ed. But during this time, I went to see -- me  and my fr iend who 

wasn™t supposed to walk with me  in the star, wher
e she was. Well, her parents had this sort of a -
- a sewing hand embroidery store. And she was 
not in the country, she wa s studying to be a 

pharmacist so mewhere else. So I talked to the pare
nts. And they asked how we were, and they -- 

they wanted to know how things were set up, an
d how we slept, and wh-where the -- see where 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
75 
 
 
the coal was, you see, because a baseme nt was us
ually for coal, anthracite. And they were just 
wondering were we right next to the coal, or  
what. Okay, fine, I-I di dn™t see them any more, I 
didn™t hear fr om the m any more. One day a soci
al worker comes in. Are Be tsy and Hedy Cohen 
living here?  Yeah, why?  Can I s
ee them?  Sure. So she came to us in the back and she said, you 
cannot stay here. This is no way 
of living for you, in the baseme nt
. Hans slept in the basement, 
too. There wa s a partition, curtains. And with 
a young ma n sleeping there, we find that™s not 
right. And we all put up a big stink.  
Q: And wha t  did y -- this was 
a she, this social worker?  
A: The social worker was a she. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: She came  that once and told us
, and I think there was a phone 
call that we should go and then 
there was a letter and how did they know where we
 were? Because of the parent s of that -- that 
friend. 
Q: Wa s Tante Toos there also when she said these things? 
A: Yes. Now she -- she had an answer, she -- she 
was right up there, and then Hans was there, 
we all di -- and even Uncle Schaap, and he said 
no, th-they should stay an
d -- but that was really 
something. I go to these parents in good will, an
d they send a social worker out after us.  
Q: Now wha t  -- was your intention that -- from th
e very beginning, was Tante Toos told that if 
some thing happened to your parents that you w
ould be contacting your Uncle Alfred and -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- and Aunt Anne is -- Anne is her name , yes? 

A: Yeah, uncle and aunt, yeah.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
76 
 
 
Q: What™s her name, the aunt™s name? 
A: The aunt?   

Q: Yeah. 

A: Annie. 

Q: Annie. So Tante Toos knew this? 

A: Yes.  

Q: But here she is being with you folks 
for three years, living every day -- 
A: Mm-h m.  

Q: -- with you two kids. Does she want you 
to stay?  Does she not
 want you to go? 
A: I think in a way, she wanted us to stay, 
because she always kept saying, well, I™m your 
mother, you know. On the other hand, I think that 
she didn't want that Hans and I would become  
too close. And it turned out that
 she didn™t want that Hans and 
any girl became too close. So 
Hans fell in love with a girl 
who came from the -- a social 
worker, who came from the East 
Indies. Her family ca me over -- she -- her family
 was invited over, the governme nt invited them 
over to come . And Tante Toos was prejudiced against 
this girl. But this was the real girl, so they 
waited until she died, and then they got ma rried. 

Q: And then got ma rried? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Huh. Now you -- you write 
to your Uncle Alfred? 
A: Yes. 

Q: In Roche -- they™re in Rochester -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- did you know that -- you knew th
at they were in Rochester? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
77 
 
 
A: No. I wrote to New York City, and some how -- 
Q: It got to them. 

A: -- it got there, and it™s this
 American Distribution Commit tee.
 They we re closely connected 
with them. It came out after they died, and my 
si ster con -- correspondent that show that they 
have helped ma ny Jews t o -- to get out some how. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And we didn™t know a thing about that.  

Q: Now, we re you expecting when you wrote to 
your aunt and uncle, that
 they would some how 
arrange for you to come  to the United States? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: You s -- you did. And did you want to come? 

A: No.  

Q: So then why did you write? 
A: Because my father told me  to. 
Q: And is -- is Hedy too young to know what she wa
nts, did she care that she go to the United 
States, or  she stayed? Did it matter to 
her, do you think?  Or she didn™t care? 
A: I don™t think she wanted to 
go either. She had ma de some  very good friends. And I was very 
much against it because, well I -- I-I could go back
 to school. I -- I had all my friends, except for 
[indecipherable] and -- and -- another thing, when -- 
when my uncle stayed with us, he was -- he 
was already ma rried, but he was alone, so he wa
s -- he didn™t have too 
ma ny worries on his mi nd 
at that time , except for wa iting for his visa. 
And I was crazy about him, because he was a 
photographer, an amateur photographer, and he di
d beautiful work. And he did all his work 
himself, in our house, and he showed me  what
 he was doing. And I was fascinated, I followed 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
78 
 
 
him like a little doggie. And I was looking forward 
to seeing him again. It
 wasn™t the same  ma n 
any more. 
Q: But you, of course, didn™t know this -- 

A: Didn™t know that -- 

Q: -- un-until you -- until -- 

A: -- I didn™t know, and I didn™t und
erstand it either, and I was -- 
now I realize he was ma rried, 
he had to keep a job. He came home  very irrita
ted often from her -- his job. He worked for an 
optical lens company as an engineer, and he
 was complaining that they would put the young 
whippersnappers in there who di
dn™t know anything and didn™t want 
to listen to what he had to 
say. He was very uptight. He was completely di
fferent from - -  from what he was before.  
Q: So when you heard -- did you ge
t a letter that you were going to
 go to the United States?  Did 
you know that they were
 trying to get -- 
A: Yes. 
Q: You -- you did. 
A: Yes. 

Q: So when you got the letter saying here are all th
e papers, you can come  to the United States -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- did you want to just write and say, ah, we
-we™re not going to come ?  Or not?  You -- you -- 
you were just going to do whatever -- 

A: Yes, because my father had sa
id -- told me  [indecipherable] 
Q: And that was enough for you? 

A: Mm, Father and I was very -- we were very close how I felt I had to, if --  

Q: Yeah. That™s a s -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
79 
 
 
A: -- that™s what he said, 
that that™s what I should do. 
Q: Wa s Tante Toos upset and surprised when you 
came to her and said we™re actually going? 
A: She was upset when the social worker came . We
 all were, but she was terribly upset. She was 
some what upset. She didn™t take
 us to the train station. 
Q: She didn™t? 

A: No, she didn™t want to come  along, she said 
she was too nervous. So Hans and Uncle Schaap 
took us to the train station ear
ly in the morning, one morning. 
Q: And did you each have a suitcase? 

A: Yes. We also hadthetrunk. 

Q: A trunk? 

A: Yeah. Now, I don™t know where the pieces of
 this trunk [indecipherable] any more , but -- 
Q: Did you take anything that your mother ha
d brought?  Did she bring 
anything from the house 
into Tante Toos™s house?  Nothing. 
A: No chance. They -- evidently they -- they 
did the basic, most im
portant things. Linen, 
blankets, the beds. 
Q: Your actual beds were in Tante Toos™s house? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Do you reme mber them leaving your apartment and getting -- 

A: No. 

Q: No. 

A: I don™t know how they got there. 

Q: It™s so odd, because you were living in the apartment -- 

A: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
80 
 
 
Q: -- yes, right? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: So there was a certain fa miliarity in Tant
e Toos™s house because you actually had so me  of 

your own things. 

A: Yes.  

Q: So in the trunk are clothes? 

A: And some linen. 

Q: And some linen. 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: And did Tante Toos give
 you some thing when you left? 
A: Yes. 

Q: What did she give you?   

A: She had a little lamp standing on a sewing ma chin
e. It was a little Arab sitting on the leaves -- 
some  leaves which are gone by now, and some  kind of shelter over his head. And he was 

smoking a very long pipe. I fell in love with -- I li
 -- I still do, I 
like little lamps like that. And 
she knew that, and she gave me  the lamp. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And she also gave me  yi -- what  Jack me n
tioned, that little windmill. Was a little windmill 
about this big, ma de out of litt
le sticks of wood. But it di dn™t 
withstand the times. The boys put 
the fingers in the window, and pushed it a li
ttle bit, and it started falling apart. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: It was old. 

Q: We ll, by now, yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
81 
 
 
A: But that was already then. 
Q: Even then it was old? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Mm-hm. So who took you to the train station 
if Tante Toos didn™t? 
Did Hans take you? 
A: Hans and Uncle Schaap. 

Q: Uh-huh. And did your uncle want to leave as
 well, or did he not
?  Your Uncle Schaap. 
A: Did -- did he want to do what? 

Q: Leave. 

A: Yeah, he thought it was 
better for us to leave. 

Q: And did he want to leave as well, or he didn™t want to? 

A: No. No, he was an older ma n. 

Q: I see. 

A: But -- 
Q: And was he in hiding in -- 
A: Yes, he was in hiding -- 

Q: -- in the Netherlands also? 

A: -- some where in the country. 

Q: And he™s your father™s brother. 
His eldest brother, is that right? 
A: He is my father™s cousin™s -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- husband. 

Q: Father™s cousin™s husband, oka
y, so he™s not a blood relative. 
A: Not really -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
82 
 
 
Q: Yeah. 
A: -- but he behaved like one, that™s for sure. 

Q: Right. 

A: And -- and -- and the wife wa
s the blood relative, and she did 
not. But she is a very, very 
warm [indecipherable] 

Q: Uh-huh. But they both survived? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Was this one of the few people in the family that survived? 

A: Yeah. Uncle Schaap, and Tante Sc haap and Be tsy. 

Q: And that was it. 

A: You know, my cousin Betsy. 

Q: Yes, and that was it. And this is
 a pretty big family that you had. 
A: It was actually, you call fi -- 
four brothers and their families. 
Q: Right. 

A: And they all had something in Amsterda m. One 
brother was a tailor, and he made  my father™s 
suits, because my father had the hunchback.  

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: So that he was actually the only one w
ho could really ma ke a suit for my father. 
Q: Wa s it a very severe hunchback? 

A: Yes. 

Q: It was?  

A: Mm-hm. Yeah, the story goes that his mother
 dropped him when he was still very small. 
That™s the story, but there is
 no -- that™s all we know. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
83 
 
 
Q: That™s it. And how did affe -- how did it a
ffect him, do you know?  Or was it not a very big 
deal for him? 
A: We ll, he took it pretty well, he wasn™t comp
laining. No, he was -- I knew [indecipherable]  
Q: Right. Did you get sick after the wa r, or only He dy got sick? 

A: Hedy got si -- 

Q: Hedy, Hedy. 

A: Hedy got sick. 

Q: Sick. You didn™t? 

A: Well, I got something else. I walked in the rain
 to school, and the top 
of my shoes were wet, 
and they were rubbing against th
e skin of my foot, and they were rubbing it open. And it just 
didn™t heal. And I had to stay home, I had to 
keep my feet up. The doctor tried everything under 
the sun. 

Q: And it didn't heal? 
A: It didn™t heal for five months or some thing like that. And the last treatme nt I reme mber is that 
he put silver on it. 

Q: Silver? 

A: Mm-hm. I read that so metimes
 it™s used, silver for healing. 
Q: Right. And did that work? 

A: Yeah. Now, I don™t know it -- if that worked, 
or ba -- but that seemed
 to ma -- close it up. 
Q: Did you have to stop going to school? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: [indecipherable] so th -- 

A: There I was again. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
84 
 
 
Q: Right. So you take a trai
n to Marseille, is that 
where you take the train to? 
A: Yes. Wh ere we took the trains
 through Brussels and went to 
Paris, where we stayed a few 
days. 
Q: Alone? 

A: No, we had a -- a -- a -- we call 
it a -- some body who oversees a couple. 
Q: A chaperone? 

A: Chap.  

Q: Yeah. 

A: We had the chaperone from the American Distribution Committee. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And we were about seven of us fr
om Holland and she in charge of us. 

Q: I see. So you stay in par -- did yo
u see Paris at all, at that time ?  

A: Paris? 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Yes. 

Q: You did. Was that nice? 

A: Yes. It was nice because there were from 
all the fellows who c -- who took us out, and we 
went to this part of Paris wh
ere they have -- I don™t know what
 you call that again. It™s a wheel 
that goes up and you go in there 
and sit and you go up and around. 
Q: A Ferris wheel? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Uh-huh. And you we re taken to that? 

A: Yeah, I was -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
85 
 
 
Q: That was nice. And then from Pa ris you went where? 
A:  Mar s ei ll e. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And whe n we came t o Marseille, we slept 
in a wheelhouse. Our orphans, the whole group of 
infan -- orphans, with the different chaperones. 
This was a great big warehouse, and we all slept 
on the floor that night befo
re we went on the ship. 
Q: And then you get on the ship the next day? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: You didn™t get sick on the ship, did you? 

A: And how. 

Q: Oh, you did? 

A: I got seasick, but Hedy got sick. 
Yeah, she got bronchitis and pneumonia. 
Q: Really?  And you just got seas
ick, which is pretty awful. 
A: Yeah, yeah, I was just seasick, but -- I 
mean, she had to go to the infirmary. 
Q: Really?  And what was wrong with her? 
A: She had pneumonia and -- 

Q: And bronchitis. 

A: -- and bronchitis, and they put cups on her 
back [indecipherable] cups of kind of thing.  
Q: Did you see this? 

A: Yes. And at -- that was still -- is still don
e in so me  places, I think. But [indecipherable] she 
got better.  

Q: Uh-huh. So she was 10 and you were 18 when you left? 

A: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
86 
 
 
Q: Right?  
A: Mm-h m.  

Q: So you™re already a young woma n at 18? 

A: Yeah. We -- 

Q: Yeah. And she™
s still a kid. 

A: She™s still a kid. That™s why it was so easy fo
r her to call Uncle and Aunt Mom and Dad right 
away. 

Q: But you couldn™t? 

A: No. 

Q: Yeah. Cause you already had a mother and father. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Yeah. Oh, we have to change the tape. 

A: Mm-h m.  
End of Tape Five 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507

Beginning Ta pe Six 
Q: What kind of a ship 
was it that you were on? 
A: A French -- a converted French freighter. A
nd the conversion was done in the place where all 
the luggage goes. What they did wa
s they put beds in there. And i-
in the mi ddle was a -- a sort of 
-- it™s almost look like a little podium. And on the one
 side we had the girls, on the other side we 
had the boys, and there were no curtains or anyt
hing, so that -- and the beds were two ba -- on 
top of each other. And -- and it was not -- we had 
no hot water, we had to wash with s-sea water. 
Well, you can™t wash with sea water.
 It doesn™t -- 
it just doesn™t -- 
Q: It doesn™t work? 
A: -- work. And it was crowded, and we were not 
the only people. We  -- we orphans were not 
the only refugees, there were more adult ref
ugees from Poland, and even a professor from 
Holland who was not a refugee. He was going to
 teach at -- at Boston. And we had long 
discussions because downstairs it wa s no -- there wa
s no ventilation. And so we stayed on that as 
long as we could, and -- that freighter, when they
 came to Ne w York there was a big scandal and 
got into the papers that this 
ship was converted, but it certainly
 didn™t have the standards that 
they were supposed to have. And the food was te
rrible, besides I was seasick, yeah, I didn™t eat 
much. And -- and he was jail
ed, the captain was jailed. 
Q: Really? 
A: That was in the New York papers, I understand. 

Q: And why was he jailed, do you know? 

A: Because he -- he ha d this ship, and he took a
ll these people, and he knew -- he was paid for, 
but he knew that he was way below 
the standard of a passenger ship. 
Q: How long were you on the ship? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
88 
 
 
A: Three weeks. After one week, one engine died. After two weeks, the second engine died. And 
we went on one engine this last 
part, and that™s 
why it took so long. 
Q: So this wasn™t a great introduction for you, was it? 

A: No. 

Q: Did you s -- did you see the St atue of Liberty when you came in?  

A: Yes. 

Q: Wa s that nice to see?  Was 
that important  in some -- 
A: Yeah, that is exciting. 

Q: It is? 

A: Because that is -- that seemed to
 us a symbol of the United States. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: The United States, the freedom, j ustice.
 Now, we were standing there, crying. 
Q: Crying, yes?  And was Hedy okay? Wa s 
she well by then, by the time  you -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: She was okay. And did she see 
the Statue of Liberty, too? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: But I don™t think she was impressed by it. 

Q: But you were? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Yeah. And were a lot of
 people standing outside -- 
A: Oh yes, almost everyone. That was the end of the trip. 

Q: Right. And who was there to greet you? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
89 
 
 
A: My aunt. My uncle wa s there, but he couldn™t 
wait for three weeks. He -- they couldn™t take 
three weeks off from work, so he had to go back to work. 
Q: So she waited for three weeks?  

A: Yeah. 

Q: Really? 

A: Because that ship was supposed to come  at 
a certain date, and it di dn™t, and she stayed.  
Q: Hm.  

A: We  stayed in a hotel after that, but she ha
d friends in -- in New York, and I suppose she 
stayed with them before we came. 

Q: But when you came s he went to a hotel with you? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Did you then take a bath? 

A: Yes, and we learned a lot 
of things that are different. 
Q: Like what? 

A: Like in -- i-i-in the Netherlands, in the wi
ntertime  it gets m -- humid and cold, and people 

wear woolen underwear and longjohns. And [indeci
pherable] will wear woolen panties. And she 

told us to forget about all that, because we were
 going to be living in cen
trally heated houses or 
buildings, and we would be -- we would not be
 needing that kind of 
underwear any more. And 
she told us about deodorant. We  didn™t 
have any. I guess it wasn™t necessary. 
Q: But now you were supposed to use it? 

A: Yeah. And she told us about putting hand loti on on after you -- after you wash your hands, so 

your skin doesn™t get rough. And 
I think she told us, never go barefoot on the floor, because you 
get athlete™s foot. We  
never heard of that.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
90 
 
 
Q: So is this all before you get to Rochester? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: She™s giving you all these little lessons. But 
you reme mbe r  her from when she was at your 
apartment. 

A: She was just -- yeah, she was just one night. 

Q: Just one night in your apartment? 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: I see. But did you recognize her when you saw her? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: You did. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: She looked the same? 

A: Pretty much. 
Q: Did you like her, were you comfortable with her? 
A: N-N-No, not at the beginning. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Because -- it™s a story again. 

Q: That™s fine. 

A: Tante Annie had sent me  from
 Vienna, a scarf and a very nice 
little automa tic pencil. Little, 
dainty, very nice. And she came whe n she saw 
me, and she said, you never wrote me  a thank you 
letter. I felt so bad. This was the greeting. 

Q: That was the fi rst thing she said? 

A: And I thought she was awful. Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
91 
 
 
Q: And that™s what you reme mbered about her. 
A: That™s what -- that ™s the only thing I reme
mbe r ed from [indecipherable]. And then -- yeah, 
that™s all I reme mbered, and I di
dn™t really know her at all. A
nd she didn™t know us, and she had 
a difficult job. And, you know, in retros
pect, they never had any kids. 
Q: So here come s a 10 year
 old and an 18 year old. 

A: And an 18 year old Dutch. And I was always
 called the stubborn Dutch 
girl, always. Hedy is 
stubborn. 

Q: But you were called stubborn? 

A: But I -- I was called 
the stubborn Dutch girl. 
Q: We re you stubborn? 

A: A little bit, but not to -- not 
of -- much more than anybody else.  
Q: Mm-hm. How -- how old -- do you know how 
old they were when you came?  We r e  they 
much older? We re they in their 50™s or 60™s? 
A: No. 
Q: No. 

A: No. I think they were -- ther
e was six years between them. She must have been ma ybe 39, and 
he was in his mi ddle 40™s -- 

Q: I see. 

A: -- I would guess. 

Q: Was she warm to you at all? 

A: Very mu ch so. 

Q: She was? 

A: Yes. And she had written le
tters to us in Holland -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
92 
 
 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: -- before we came. And in the letters she 
was very, very wa rm, yeah. And she -- she -- she 
was warm.  

Q: Mm-hm. So did you come to like he
r very much?  Or was that difficult? 

A: That was difficult. One thing is that I al
ready had most of my manners, and some -- my 
personality was pretty we ll formed. I mean, it wa
s not that you couldn™t change anything, but it 
was mo -- more difficult to work w
ith an 18 year old than with a 10. 
Q: Right. 

A: And I -- they always had some thing to say, 
everything was wrong. They wanted me to be a 
perfect American gi rl, the all American girl, 
one, two, three. Hair di
fferent, dress different, 
everything. 

Q: So this was difficult for you? 

A: Mm. It was not difficult for Hedy. She fit right 
in. I didn't want to have them harp on me all 
the time , and they were. They wanted to turn me
 into a very attractive American girl , which I 
wasn™t.  

Q: Did you say anything to them? 

A: No, I did not. And that I had left over from 
the war. I felt if I would start saying some thing, 
they would throw us out. And they wouldn™t have
, but that was in my mi nd. One time, when I 
said -- contradicted Tante Anne, Uncle Alfred 
came  flying down the stairs. How did you dare to 
contradict your Aunt Annie?  That wa s the firs
t time that I had said some thing, I forgot what. 
Yeah, they became quite desperate with me , and I was put in the senior year of the high school, 

so I could have the Ame r ican diploma, things woul
d be easier for me . And they wanted me  to tell 

them what I wanted to become , what life work 
I had chosen. I had no idea. And they had me  go 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
93 
 
 
to different technical schools, and 
they told them they -- they told
 the school principal they didn™t 
know what to do with me any more, and the coun
selor. And there was a school psychologist who 
gave me  a couple of tests. And they told me  -- they told them to send me  to college. 
Q: Wait a minute, say this agai n, they what? The -- they -- the -- 

A: This -- they told me  to send them -- to send -- 

Q: Send you to college? 

A: -- me  to college. The college was right behind 
the high school that I went to. There was -- and 
-- and not to worry, and 
send her to college.  
Q: Did that ma ke you feel good? 

A: Oh yeah. 

Q: Mm.  

A: Yeah. Of course, I didn™t know exactly wh
at college  would be like, because in the 
Netherlands, when you graduate from the seco
ndary school, you go to the university. You are a 
student already, you are almost a 
grown up. And a college here is not yet for grown ups. But I 
liked it.  

Q: What sort of culture shock was ther
e for you in comi ng to the United St ates? 
A: All the food you could eat, all the bananas ever
ywhere. All these pastries all over the place. 
The automa tic [indecipherable] we had a little bit of that in Amsterda m, one little spot which 

[indecipherable] was a great big automa tic thing, 
and oh, I had never seen 
that before. You™ve 
got -- you know. And so ma ny people in the streets,
 and so -- s-so humid and so hot. That was 
terrible, I ca -- I™ m still not used to it. It was --  that  was New York in September, and it was hot. 

And di -- the departme nt stores, th
e size of the departme nt stores, 
there ha -- there are departme nt 
stores in Holland, but the gigantic
 sizes here of everything. And I 
still think so when I come  in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
94 
 
 
from winter, the dist ances are bigger, everythi ng 
is so big and wide. And the other culture shock 
part of it was that I was -- I c
ouldn™t speak too we ll yet, but I h
eard what all the other girls were 
saying [indecipherable]. They were 
saying, oh I™m so tired, oh I™m so 
tired. I got to say that later 
too, but at that time  -- and then they were talk
ing about, did you see him?  He asked me out for 
Saturday, and did you see her clothes?  They didn™t 
fit at all. Well, I -- 
I couldn™t understand how 
16 - 17 year old girls could talk like that. They 
are more ma ture in Holland. They were. Things 
have changed. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: But at that time , whe n you were 16 - 17, you we
re pretty serious stud
ent, no ma tter where you 
were. And you -- and you don™t talk about some body el
se™s clothes, or -- 
or guys, or -- yeah, 
guys of course, once in awhile, but not all the tim
e. And they never talked about a book they had 
read, or more serious things. And I c
ould not -- I could not understand it. 
Q: Do you understand it now? 
A: Yeah. Well, I see where they™re comi ng from. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And I think some  of them have be come  more 
serious, some  of the teenagers, because of the 
conditions we find ourselves in now. 
They realize it. But, of course
, that was a pretty golden time  
for the States, 1950 -- 1946 - 1947. They
 had everything they wanted. 
Q: We re you very unhappy when you came here, and st
ayed in wa -- Rochester?  Did that ma ke 
you unhappy? 

A: I had no say over it. It was the only thing we
 could do. No, it didn™t ma ke me  happy, but I -- 
but what were we going to do?  We  had to
 do what Uncle and Aunt told us to. 
Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
95 
 
 
A: I know they had a difficult job, but they really
 left me  with the feeling that I am not smart 
enough, I don™t work fast enough, I -- if I don™t have 
a date calling back it™s 
my fault. And after I 
left the house and went to private school, what
 did they say to my 
sister? Why don™t you study?  
Betsy always studied. Why don™t you do this
 well?  Betsy always did that well. 
Q: That™s what they said -- 

A: To Hedy. 

Q: -- to Hedy. 

A: After I left the house, a
nd I was in Cleveland then. 
Q: And did Hedy tell you that -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- this was what they were sa
ying?  You must have been shocked. 
A: Yeah, I was. It -- it even worked in -- in co
llege. It just so happened the French professor 
liked me, and -- and Hedy didn™t s -- ma -- she 
didn™t work as seriously, ma ybe. I don™t know 
how she worked, I wasn™t there. But Hedy told me 
that my French professor told her, what™s the 
ma tter of you?  You™re Betsy™s sister, why -- 
why can™t you learn that
?  All that happened 
afterward, but it™s already done dama ge.  

Q: Did -- did you ever tell them, later on, when you 
were no longer in the house, what it felt like? 
Or you never did? 

A: I never did. 

Q: They also told you not to speak 
about your experiences, am I correct? 
A: True. 

Q: What did they tell you? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
96 
 
 
A: Oh, don™t tell anybody, because nobody will understand. Nobody who didn™t go through these 
things personally, they don™t ha
ve any idea what you™re talking 
about. They won™t understand it. 
You ma y as well not talk about it. 

Q: Did they ask you?  So you told them what happe
ned?  Di -- I mean, did they ask you to explain 
what had happened to you during the war?  To them. 

A: Uncle and Aunt? 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Yes, yes. 

Q: So they knew. 

A: Not an awful lot. 

Q: Uh-huh.  

A: They wanted me  to forget about it. 

Q: Yeah. It was said to a lot of people 
who came , wasn™t it?  
Don™t talk about it. 
A: I don™t know. 

Q: I think so. 

A: I don™t know anybody else to whom it was said. 

Q: Uh-huh. Did that ma ke you feel bad? 

A: Yes. We ll, I wasn't  going to shout it around. I 
wasn™t going to ma ke that a subject of a 
discussion. Didn™t have to tell me
 that, but the fact that I r
eally wasn™t supposed to -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- yeah, it bothered me . 

Q: Did -- did people at school as you what happe
ned during the war, or was it as if -- I don™t 
know, the war happened to other people, it wa
s never the people that you were me  -- do you

know what I mean?  It wa s if it was a blank time . 
So did any of the students say to you, you were 
in the Netherlands, what happened?  No. Not the teachers?  Nobody? 
A: Nobody. 

Q: So di -- did you keep thinking ab out it, or did you also try to ge
t rid of it in some -- in some 
way?  

A: No, I didn't try to get rid of it,
 but I didn™t wa -- I wasn't  preocc
upied with it any mo re at all. I 
was -- I became  preoccupied with the school work. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And no, I wasn™t. My father --
 I missed my father all along.  
Q: More than your mother, it was your 
father that you kept
 thinking about? 
A: Mm-hm. I mi ssed him awfully much. It wasn™t
 until I got married that
 -- that that stopped. 
Q: It stopped. And you me t your husband in 
Cleveland when you were going to school? 
A: Mm-h m.  
Q: And did he ask you about it? 
A: Mm-h m.  

Q: He did. 

A: But that was not so good, because now I don™
t like going over the border, being asked where 
I™m going. 

Q: You don™t like to a -- you don™t like to 
be to -- asked where you™re going. 
A: Where I™m going, wh-where -- 
who am I visiting. That™s what 
we are asked at the border. 
And on the way back, what did you bring, who ga
ve you something, what was it, what was the 
value?  I don™t like that. A
nd that is fr om the war. 
Q: It remi nds you.

Q: Betsy, when -- when did you actually start ta
lking about your experi
ences during the war?  
Only in the f- fa mily, or did you talk in di -- in other places? 
A: I did a little bit in college, because peopl
e would ask, where were you during the war -- the 
Jewish people. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: So I told them I was hidden during the war. 
Just Jewish people. And my doctor in Wi ndsor 

some how knew about it through Roseanne 
because he™s ro -- my daughter --  

Q: Right. 

A: -- he™s her doctor, too, and he -- he we
nt down and sat with me  and wanted to know 

everythi ng, before, you know, he became [indec i phe
rabl e] and wanted to know how it was and 
how I felt. Yes, in college I didn™t do much about. I told you I 
spoke at the PTA meeting once, 
but I -- yes, I was asked to speak at the PTA 
me e ting when I was in hi
gh school, but I was asked 
to speak about Holland. So I had to do research because things had change d already.  

Q: Right. 

A: So I spoke about Holland, but
 not about my experiences.  
Q: Did you -- when you -- when your kids were 
born -- you have three children, did you -- when 
they reached a certain age, di
d you tell them about your experien
ces?  Or only when they were 
older? 

A: We ll, they all knew about it, 
but gee, I don™t reme mb
er if I told them, or my husband. They 
all had different reactions, though. No, I don™t think 
I went down and sa -- and told them, like 
you know, like we are talking. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
100 
 
 
A: No. No. But then the boys got 
older and they starte
d asking more questions and then I gave 
them more answers. 
Q: Right. But you say that they a
ll have different reactions. What 
are the -- what are the different 
reactions that they have? 

A: Jack is very interested in the experiences. He
 also wants to see where I went to grade school. 
He wants to see the house we were in, and th
e Germans next door. And by the way, in that 

house, in the front room under the floor are still seve
ral jars of jam that my
 mother put there, but 
she never had the chance to get them out. And if
 nobody changed that floor, they are still there. 
Q: They are still there. This is the or
iginal, the -- the hous
e that you grew up in? 
A: No, that was the house wher
e we lived before the hiding. 
Q: Uh-huh, right. 

A: Yeah. The offices were downstairs, and -- 

Q: Right. 
A: -- I don™t -- I don™t think she 
had any help, I think she did that
 all by herself. Cut -- cut the 
piece out of the floor and put the -- 
Q: Put the jam in. Why did she put it there? 

A: We ll, you were not supposed to horde any mo re
, so that was one reason. And she wanted to 
have it, though. She thought it 
was important to have.  
Q: Mm-hm. Hm. And Rosea
nne, what™s her response? 
A: I don™t wa nt to be Jewish any mo re, because
 I don™t want to go to a concentration camp. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Now that was all the way through, all the wa
y through until ma ybe just a year ago. She has a 
10 year old daughter who sings in
 a choir, and the choir is th
e Wi ndsor [indecipherable] opera 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
101 
 
 
choir, so everybody™s in there. And Roseanne
 thought around Christma stime there were too 
ma ny songs about Jesus. And she told them so. Sh
e said, I don™t do Christma s, I a m Je wish. You 
shouldn™t just think -- but Roseanne has a way of
 saying things [indecipherable] ma ke angry. So 
now she™s got to come to a meeting, there are go
ing to be board me mber s there of that opera 
situation. Now, that™s the first 
time that she has come forward to
 say that she™s Jewish. Before 
that, she didn™t want to have a
nything to do with it. She didn™t 
even look for Jewish guys ever, 
ever. She had two bad marriages
. Mark, that™s the mi ddle one. 
Q: That™s your son, yes. 
A: He was very interested. He wa
s very interested. He went to Israel when he graduated from 

college and he stopped in Amsterdam. My cousin
 was still alive, my cousin Betsy. And he 
wanted her to take him to the old [indecipherabl
e] synagogue there that I-I even haven™t seen. 
And he wanted to know a lot about the time.  

Q: Mm-h m.  
A: But he has become  ultra-Orthodox, and so now
 he™s more interested
 in ma king me  Orthodox. 
But he has the empathy. He definitely has the empathy. 
Q: Mm-hm, for your experience, uh-huh, yeah. 

A: Yes. He is a very sensitive person, he ought to
 be a social worker or
 a psychologist, but he 

cleans the shule.  

Q: Mm-hm. And he lives in 
Israel? He lives in Israel? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Yes. 

A: With eight children. 

Q: Eight?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
102 
 
 
A: Mm-hm. He lives in -- on the We st Bank, th
e disputed territory. And I™m the mothe r , so 
excuse me , but I think Mark is very smart. 

Q: He™s very smart? 

A: So is Jack. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: But Mark is in a different way. He seems to 
pick it up out of the air. He was good student, and 
he™s just that smart.  

Q: So let me  ask you, you -- you were not feeling 
very much Jewish iden
tity during the war. 
A: No. No. 

Q: What about after the war? 

A: Passover? 

Q: No, after the war. 

A: After the war? 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: We ll, e-everything changed. All I knew was 
matzoh at Passover, no bread. And not going to 
school during the high holidays, Rosh Hashanah 
and Yom Ki ppur. And that™s all I knew. Oh, I 
also knew that Jews sometimes ate different 
foods, but I didn™t know how different until we 
came to the States and Uncle and Aunt -- Uncl
e being Mother™s brother, being family of 
Schwartz™s [i ndecipherable] was pretty relig
ious. And they belonged to the Conservative 
synagogue. And we had to stay home from school and go to all the services.  

Q: So was this part of your culture shock? 

A: No. Wha t  disappointed me  was that the wome
n had to sit on the balcony, and there was no air 
conditioning, and it was September in Rochester a
nd it was hot. I thought I™d die. And so there 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
103 
 
 
was so muc h Hebrew. I hadn™t learned any Hebr
ew. Now I™m beginning to feel I should know 
more, but at that time, they talk
 Hebrew, well, I was daydreami ng. 
Q: Did they send you to Hebrew school? 
A: No. 

Q: They didn™t. 

A: You me a n in Holland? 

Q: No. 

A: Oh. 

Q: In Rochester, when you moved there. 

A: No. 

Q: No. Did they send ha -- 

A: No. 

Q: No. 
A: No. 
Q: Neither of you.  

A: But Hedy became a Sunday school teacher in the Refor m s ynagogue because she got to know 

some  guy. And so he got -- she became a Sunday sc
hool teacher, so she learned very mu ch more 
about Judaism quickly, where she start keeping to
 everything. And like I said, with Uncle and 
Aunt, I learned -- bagels were new, bagels I 
had never heard of. And -- and -- and smoked he -- 

smoked salmon, I didn™t know anything about. And 
such thing as [indecipherable], which my 
husband™s sister ma ke very good [indecipherable]
 and I -- I had never, never seen that. 
Q: Did you like it? 

A: Yes. And the only way you could eat ma tzohs 
in Holland was with butter and sugar over it.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
104 
 
 
Q: Butter and sugar? 
A: Yeah. Very fine sugar. Not powdered suga
r, a sugar in between. 
And that does taste good. 
Q: Really? I™ll try it. 

A: Yeah.  

Q: So do you think that in s -- that because of
 being in this household where it was mo re 
religious than you grew up, that you became mor e  identi
fied with je -- with Judaism, or it™s just 

that you were -- it was clear you were Jewish an
d that was it?  Were -- did you -- did you go to 
synagogue more once you were -- 

A: Yes, I did. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And the reason why I did, and 
especially [indecipherable] they
 had Rabbi Phil Bernstein, and 
Philip Bernst ein wrot e a book which is called, ﬁWhat
 do Jews Believe?ﬂ It wa -- it was a long 
time ago, but it was a bestseller. And his sermons we
re just out of this world. So I went out of 
my own will, I went every Friday in my last
 year of college, cause he was inspiring.  
Q: Well, that ™s interesting. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: And whe n you got married, did you go to
 synagogue?  Or did you send your kids to 
synagogue? 

A: We  always landed in a nei
ghborhood that was far from the Jewish community, because we 

moved around a lot. And even in Windsor, I lived 
in Wi ndsor east, the Jews lived in Wi ndsor 
south, but we  couldn™t afford the homes there. So
 the children were really not exposed much, 
except that we sent Jack and Mark to Sunday sc
hool in Mansfield at the time, which was about 
12 miles away from us, Mansfield, Ohio. And Jack 
was ready to be Bar-Mi
tzvahed, but he didn™t 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
105 
 
 
want to be Ba r-Mitzva hed. And when Mark was 
in college, he became almost a born again 
Christian. He happened to have a friend who wa
s, and his friend™s mother and I me t through 
unusual circumstances and became close friends. Bu
t she got Mark. She got them to go with her 
to Wa shington to the Peace March 
and all the things that they
 do. And my  husband said, I don™t 
like that. And then my husband read in the Jewish
 news that there was going to be some  kind of 
Jewish meeting in New York City, but you didn™t 
know how Jewish. So he went there, and he 
me t Rabbi Hecht. Rabbi Hecht was very ultra-Or
thodox, and he was -- his work was to reach out 
to the students. And he got Mark. And now Mark is Orthodox. 
Q: Right.  

A: And it™s really unusual because  we -- we di
dn™t have mu- much contact with Jewish people 

when we -- in Cleveland, yeah. But then, when
 we had to move to those small communities, 
there were hardly any Jews. And it was a hardsh
ip to take him every Sunday to Sunday school, 
especially if one of them didn't want to. So Ro
seanne was not very much -- we couldn™t show her 
very mu -- didn™t show her very much. But she had her own reasons for not wanting to be 

Jewish, you know. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: So that™s how it worked with 
the kids. I think Jack 
identifies with us as being Jewish, but he 
wanted to show his daughter wh
at the high holidays were like, 
and he brought her to a synagogue 
in L.A., and they told him you can™t come
 in unless you pay 500 dollars. That was -- 
Q: And that was the end. Have you ever talked
 about your experiences 
to schoolchildren, have 
you ever been invited to do that, or wanted to do it? 

A: No. But the Jewish center got to know about
 me  through Mark, who was a -- a me mber there, 
active me mber. A-An -- and -- and -- and about 
my -- he talked about my background, and they 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
106 
 
 
have a Yom HaShoah -- they have a few days 
ago in the Conservative synagogue, the Refor m, 
and there™s little one, ultra-Or
thodox. And some  [indecipherable] 
in town, and they have some  
kind of ceremony where we have to
 -- the -- the survivors have to
 go up on the stage, and they 
have to turn on a candle. And they
 don™t say who they are -- we are,
 but we are the survivors, and 
so I was called by the Jewish
 Center to take part. 
Q: Are you pleased that there is so much publicit
y about the Holocaust now that -- that there are 
more programs on television, that there™s more
 written about it than when you first came ?  
A: Yes. 

Q: You are.  

A: What upsets me now is that th
ere are people who still don™t believe. 
Q: Mm. How do you think this experience has affected you? 

A: It™s going to affect me ? 

Q: No. How has it?  
A: That I was very angry, cause it was the -- 
the mi nister of one of the western provinces who 
said --  he was Dutch -- it never ha ppened. An
-And -- and he s -- he was --  made anti-Semitic 
speeches, but when he said it ne ver ha ppened, I wa
s thinking, what can I do about that?  Yeah, I 
didn't like that. 
Q: When -- when you think about your life now, 
and you think about what it was like for you in 
the Netherlands because of the war, and because
 you were in hiding, do you think that changed 
you very mu ch? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Do you think it affected you a great deal? 

A: Yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
107 
 
 
Q: And -- and how -- how would you explain 
what it did to you?  Do -- do you know? 
A: We ll, I knew that Tante Toos™s
 brother-in-law said, get rid of 
them. And I just figured if -- if 
we would make trouble, and -- and ma ke things 
difficult for Tante Toos in some  way, like my 
mom did at times, we would be
 thrown out on the street.  
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: And that feeling has been w
ith me  all the time . I don™t want to antagonize people because I™m 
afraid they™ll throw me
 out on the street.  

Q: So you don™t want to fi
ght, you don™t want to argue. 
A: No. And -- and -- and my kids
 are the opposite, all three. They
 say what -- what they think. I 
don™t.  

Q: Still you -- you 
still don™t.  
A: Actu -- I say what I think, but if
 it™s going to ma ke friction, I don™t. 
Q: You don™t.  
A: No. And like I said, I don™
t like border inspection. 
Q: Right. 
A: Stuff like that. And I also horde. Once in aw
hile Wi ndsor cannot sell a product and slowly it 
will go off the shelves. And when I notice that
, and it is something that I™m using, I horde. 
Q: So what are you hoarding now? 

A: I -- I have a couple of pieces of Caress soa
p. They took that off the Wi ndsor ma rket, but I 
understand it™s still [indecipherable] 

Q: Right, it™s here. Shall we send you some ?  

A: Oh no. 

Q: No.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
108 
 
 
A: I still have about
 five big pieces. 
Q: Uh-huh. Okay. 
A: That should go me  a while.  

Q: Do you think that the -- do you think that the war harmed you? 

A: Yes. 

Q: How?  

A: You know how isolated I felt, and now, af
terward, I™m -- I™m just very shy. I™m not 
aggressi ve, I™m not self assertive at all because
 for one, I -- I don™t bump and rock the boat. And 
for another, I want the other person to show me  
first, how -- what they
 mean, are they really 
friendly, or are they just putting it on? 

Q: And for you that -- you 
think that come s from th
e war, not from before? 
A: Yeah, I think so. 

Q: Mm-h m.  
A: I think so because Hitler ma de it so obvious
 that there are Jews who did everythi ng wrong. 
And before the war, to me, the Jews 
weren™t any different
 from anybody else. 
Q: Right. 
A: I had Jewi sh friends and I had Christian frie
nds, and there were -- well, first my mo m of 
course, would -- I di dn™t accept it from her really
, but then when Hitler came , you couldn™t he lp 
it any more. 

Q: You had to believe her then, yeah. 

A: And the name  was Cohen, too.  

Q: Who was  Cohen? 

A: I was Cohen. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0507  
109 
 
 
Q: Right.  
A: Yeah. 

Q: So you couldn™t avoid it. 

A: No. 

Q: No. This is -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Is there anything that you would like 
to say that we haven™t talked about? 
A: Yeah, I -- I should say that you should not ju
dge a person too quickly. 
That -- yeah. Wa it and 
see more of his personality aspect before you ma
ke a judgment. That™s what I want to say.  
Q: Okay. Well, Betsy, thank you so much. We  s p
ent a number of times on the telephone and I™m 
so glad that you were able to come  to Wa shington and -- 

A: Oh, thank you. 

Q: -- and be with us. Thank you very much. 
A: We ll, thank you for asking. 
Q: You™re welcome. 

A: And thank Jack for comi ng with me  because alone I wouldn™t have done it.  

Q: Right, I know.  

A: Yeah.
