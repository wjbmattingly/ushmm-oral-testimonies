CONRAD MEHLER 
December 13, 1993 
 
Beginning Ta pe One 
 
Question: Would you tell us please, your name ? 
Answer: My name  is Conrad Mehler. 

Q: Would you tell us wher
e -- where you were born? 
A: I was born in Vienna, March 27, 1915. 

Q: Would you be so kind to tell us a few 
words about your childhood, where you lived, and how 
was your day to day life duri
ng your childhood?  Also, a few word
s about the background of your 
fa mily. 

A: My father was a physician. He was, during Worl
d Wa r I, in the Austrian army as a physician 
and therefore then, wh-when the war started, the 
fa mily went to Vienna from Chernowitz. I was 
born in Vienna during the war, and stayed in Vi
enna til 1919. After the war 
we returned to -- to 
Bukavina. My father was a physician in a small v
illage, which -- the name  
of is [indecipherable]. 
This was a community of 5,000 people, and he wa
s serving the area of 15 such villages, so a 
population over 50,000, it was in the area of 
Suceava, which was the topic of this 
[indecipherable] in that time . I went to school in 
Roma nia, first in [indeci
pherable] at the primary 
school, at the elementary school, the four grad
es and then I we nt to the gymnasium in 

Chernowitz where I stayed with
 [indecipherable]. I finished 
high school in Chernowitz in 1932, 
made the baccalaureat e, and during the -- my stay in Chernowitz ther e was some anti-Semitism 

in the schools, but some  of it being [indecipherabl
e] with a mi nority Jews, so it wasn™t felt too 
badly. There were some  fights be
tween students. It was -- one 
element which I reme mber was 
with one of the -- during the bacc
alaureate, one of the st -- Je
wi sh student s was killed by a 
Roma nian student dur -- while we
 were waiting for the results of the baccalaureate, which was --

at that time  was [indecipherable]. It was 
a very famous, very well known, anti-Semitic group, 
[indecipherable] and there was a big funeral for 
[indecipherabl e] [indecipherable]. I -- after I 
finished my schooling in Chernowitz in 1933, Hi
tler came  to power in Germany. But being 
raised in a village which had 
-- half of the population was Ge rm
an [inde cipherable] population, I 
had German friends from school, which we were t
ogether [indecipherable] 
and as soon as Hitler 
came to power in Germany they stopped talking 
to me  and they stopped chasing me  and they 
stopped knowing me . So it was the fi
rst encounter where the influence of the Nazi regime  had an 
effect even before Romania --
 while Roma nia was still under 
the governme nt, the democratic 
governme nt that had nothing to do with Hitler, but the Germans beca -- stopped talking to me  
and ignoring me  [indecipherable]. 
I went to study to Italy where 
the situation, even though it was 
a [indecipherable] regime, for the Jews ther
e was no discrimination and I had very good 
experience in Ital y. During all my studies, even 
when the -- when the H
itler-Mussolini pact came 
into effect and they wanted the Jew -- th-the Je
wish professors were eliminated from the -- from 
teaching and from [indecipherabl e]. And we were supposed to go at the end to the exams 

separated from the Gentiles, but the Italians refu
sed to do it and so we went together, because 

there was always a very good, spirit of ca mit -- ca
ma raderie. It happened 
at one time , they had 
[indecipherable] students in Bol
ogna and they want -- they made
 a big fuss and so on, so the 
Italian students went with us agai
n th-there. So they we
re really very ni ce, all the time. I was 
lucky enough to live in the house of a -- of a [indecipherable] and with his fa mily that I was 

really like a -- like a son in their house, so th
ere was no problem during my stay in Italy. In 1940, 
Ch-Chernowitz was occupied by the Russians. I th
ink it was 28 of June, 1940, and we were left 
in Italy without [indecipherable] with -- with our 
home town. There were, at that time  in Bologna 

there were several hundred Jewish students [inde
cipherable] school, from all over Europe, from 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0282

Poland, from Lithuania, from [indecipherable], 
from Hungary and so on. We were studying in 
Italy -- in -- in a foreign c
ountry was because under Roma nian
 universities there was no more 
scholarships and you couldn™t be accepted [indeci
pherable] when you were accepted, you were 
beaten up and so on. There was a 
lot of -- unpleasant to be stu
dying there, so therefore ma ny 
studied in Prague, in Italy, or in France, some  
in Switzerland [indecipherable]. So, we are talking 
still about 1940, Chernowitz was occupied un -- 
came under the Russian [indecipherable] and we 
were blocked in Bologna, we didn™t know what 
to do. We  had to go -- to go back to Chernowitz, 
to stay in Italy. Italy was alre
ady the pact with Mussolini - Hitler and it was already war agai nst 

[indecipherable] together with Germa ny agai
nst France and England. So we decided, two 
colleagues who were in Bologna at that time, 
to go back to Chernowitz. Everybody consulted us, 
and said it would be better to go back to Cherno
witz inst ead of staying here where there is 
[i ndecipherable] anti-Semitism and danger. So, I went with another colleague to the main 

embassy in Rome , to take care of my Roma nian 
passport, which expired during my stay in Italy, 
and got a new passport, in end of July of 1940. 
And came back to Bologna and a group of other 

colleagues decided that we are leaving and we
 are going back to th
e -- to Chernowitz, to 
Roma nia. We -- I went with another colleague, an
d a group left  a week before us, to Bucharest. 
We stayed in ca -- another couple of days in Bo
logna. We  arranged in Italy that time they should 
expulse us, expulsion from Italy to
 the Yugoslavian border so we 
didn™t have to [indecipherable] 
and so on. They were very nice, the Italians, they
 were very forthcoming, 
and we s-started -- and 
we started our [indecipherable] back to Roma nia.
 Everything went [indeci
pherable] went -- went 
okay til we came to some -- I don™t reme mber exac
tly the place where the tra --  i-i-in the trai n 
there came the Iron Guard, me mbers of the Iron 
Guard who were out of Roma nia in Germany, 
and came back [indecipherable] the regime  in Ro
ma nia changed, so they came  back to Roma nia 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0282

in the train. They started going w
ith their [indecipherable] comi ng back fr om Italy, they started 
to ma ke re marks with, we  are going to take ca
re of you when you come  ba ck to Roma nia. We  
didn't mi nd, we didn™t pay much attention to it. 
Anyway, we didn™t have a -- much choice, we 
went -- we were supposed to go to Bucharest, 
and to Bucharest we had relatives, and so we 
fi gured we [i ndecipherable] to Bucharest and fr
om there we will see what -- what will happen 
further, if we should go to Chernowitz or not. We
 came to the border, to Jimbolia which was the 
border and fr om there we were supposed to go to
 [indecipherable] which was the first big city, 
but [indecipherable] in Jimbolia, while we were 
waiting for the train to proceed, was who -- the -
- they came  back, they took our passport and sa
id we have to come  
down, we cannot enter 
Romania. 

Q: Who took your passport? 

A: The border police. 

Q: Roma nian, or Yugoslav? 
A: Roma nian, Roma nian. We  wa
s in the Roma nia [indecipherabl
e] border it was the Romanian, 
[indecipherable] was the Yugoslavian
 part of the border. So we -- they took away our passports 
and they said you cannot proceed because you 
are communists and we cannot let you in, and 
they took away our passports and arrested us an
d kept us in the -- in
 the police 
station in 
Jimbolia, and they -- it was 24 hours, after 24 hours 
they decided that we  have to leave Roma nia. 
They took away our documents, our passports, 
our luggage, everything, 
and at mi dnight some  
[indecipherable] which is the borde
r patrols of the Roma nian, took us
 with the order that™s if we 
try to return to Romania, we w
ill be killed. They have orders 
to shoot us. So we started, my 
friend and I and the third person who was with us
, started to walk through the fields in the 
direction Yugoslavia. And we were sure that they
 are going to shoot us as soon as we got in the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0282  
5 
 
fields, because they said they have orders to shoo
t us if we tried to return to Roma nia. So we 
wandered through the fields for a couple of hours, til we heard barking of dogs, and we knew 
that we are in the vicinity of a village . So we 
continued to walk into this village, and we found 
there this -- there were in the 
village, letters on the stores and so on, so we knew we  are in 
Yugoslavia. Start wandering at ni
ght and were around four or five
 o™clock in the morning, and 
without documents, without anything, without m
oney, without any means. Started walking and 
we are looking for some  name s whic h would s
ound Jewish, ma ybe a stor
e or [indecipherable] 
that we could get some  [indecipherable] and ma ybe 
get in touch with our relatives in Bucharest, 
which were at that time  still in Bucharest. Wh
ile we were walking, wandering through the village 
in the early morning hours, there came  a border 
patrol who spoke only Se
rbian, and we couldn™t 
communicate with [indecipherable] with him 
and he took us to the ma in station in 
[indecipherable] these border vi
llages, and there a blonde, tall Se
rbian guy from the border police 
came and greeted us, and took us to his home and le
t us wash up. We  we re dirty from the walk in 
the field. And told the wife to prepare a breakfa
st for us, and kept us there til noon because the 
next day to the main -- main town with this to
 -- the border there, was Be lica Chachinda. And he 
kept us there til noon time and then he  took us
 to Belica Chachinda where the -- where the 
station chief was already notified that [indeciphe
rable] Jews are on the way to Belica Chachinda. 
He came, he  treated us ve ry friendly, he sai
d, you -- we will take you, there is a Jew, a Mr. 
Frankel, who was in the import export business fo
r cattle, and he will take care of you for the 

mome nt, til we find out what to 
do with you. And really we came to
 this Mr. -- Mr. Frankel, and 
found that our colleagues who left a week before, 
they were all there at his house. And so we 
stayed in the house of Mr. Frankel, and we st
arted [indecipherable] what to do next. In the 
meanti me  we telephoned to Bucharest and we got in
 touch with relatives of ours, and one of the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0282

relatives was in the -- in fact in the reserves 
and the officer in the Roma ni an army in the -- 
Roma nia, still stationed some wher
e in -- in the vicinity of -- ca
me  through the border to start to 
negotiate what to do with us. So it lasted anothe
r week or so. In the m
eantime the brother of Mr. 
Frankel went  to Belgrade to talk to the Russian
 embassy. Yeah, I want to m- me ntion that when I 
was in Rome on the Roma nian passport, I went 
also to the Russian embassy -- to the Soviet 
embassy in Rome . The police knew, the Italian 
police were notified that I am going because I 
wanted a visa to Roma ni a, to Chernowitz. This 
he didn™t give me , but he said he notified the 
[indecipherable] in Bucharest, was that we come  
to Roma nia, they would take care of us. They 
never did, it was just a story, 
nobody did anything. But our relativ
es arranged our return to 
Bucharest. So part of us went back to Buchares
t. Another part, four of
 our colleagues were not 
allowed, were not permitted again, ha d to go back the same  -- same  through the fields to 

Yugoslavia. Even though they had the same  pass
ports like we  did [indecipherable] all valid 
passports, Roma nian passports, Romanian citizens.
 So [indecipherable] of
 these friends, all of 
them perished during the war, in Yugoslavia.
 We don™t know exactly what happened to them, 
ma ybe it was the partisans or whatever where 
they ended up on their own, were killed in 
Yugoslavia during the war by the Germans. We  c a me
 back to Bucharest, we were supposed to go 
to our families when we came to Bucharest, but 
we were arrested immediatel y at the -- at the 
station in Bucharest, and taken to the police statio
n sec -- security and stayed there for a week or 
10 days. Our relatives tried to get in touch, we c
ouldn™t get in touch with our relatives, and the 
didn™t know what to do with us. They kept us th
ere for a week or 10 days. They wanted to send 
us -- in that  time there was a camp of the Iron Guar
d, it was still -- there were some in the -- in --  
in a camp. They wanted to send us for political pr
isoners, but finally they 
decided to send us to 
the border, to Bukavina, which was -- in that 
time people could walk over from [indecipherable] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0282

Roma nia to Russia. There was an agreement between Russia and Roma nia and so ma ny were 
sent over the border to -- to Russia. And so I came 
to Russia, and I stayed there from ™40 to ™41, 
worked in the hospital, the central hospital in Chernowitz. 

Q: Let me  a sk you one question relating to the 
year during which Bukavina was under Russian 
occupation. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Did you ever witness deportati
on of Jews from Bukavina -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- to Siberia, or -- 

A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: -- wherever -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- by the Russian authorities -- 
A: Yeah, often. 
Q: [indecipherable] 

A: Around -- see, I worked in the hospital, a
nd they had three rooms wher e people, they 
[indecipherable] capitalist Jews from -- from Ch
e r nowitz were imprisoned and were deported to 
Siberia. There were ma ny deported to Siberia. 
Started in May 1941, ma ny Je
ws were deported to 
Siberia, I would say probably 5,000. It was ju 
-- even during -- when the war started already, 
when the Germans already started the war, they 
were still transporting pe
ople from the railroad 
station to -- to Siberia. 

Q: Can you tell me  please what happened to 
you and -- and your fa mily once [indecipherable] 
operations starting in June -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0282  
8 
 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- on June 22
nd
, 1941. 
A: Yeah. I was on my duty in th
e hospital when it started, and 
the hospital had a lot of wounded 
Russian troops and so on. We  started imme di
ately evacuating the Russian troops, the Russian 
wounded patients, and I was supposed to go with 
the Russians, the medical corps to -- they 
vacated to Sebastopol. I decided to stay becau
se my mother was living in Chernowitz, my 

grandparents. I, being the only chil
d and so on, I decided to stay in
 Chernowitz. As I said, I take 
a chance if the war [indecipherable]
 with the army only to stay [i
ndecipherable]. I never expected 
the Germans to annihilate whole populations, and 
I stayed in Chernowitz. I s -- I went to the 
hospital, but after -- and imme di
ately with the entrance of the 
German and the -- the Ro manian 
occupation force, they started at random to shoot 
Jews in the periphery of
 Chernowitz, that is, in 
the outposts of Chernowitz, and it 
star ted the regime of terror imme
diately. I went still a day or 
two to the hospital, but then I found it too danger
ous even to walk the streets and I stayed home 
and police came  in the morning to take me  to work, to clean streets or whatever, and it started 

imme diately [indecipherable] the grand Rabbi 
of Chernowitz, Dr. [indecipherable] very well 
known to me, and his children, with his [indeciph
erable] the son was a friend of mi ne, was a 
rabbi from [i ndecipherable] in Bucharest in [i
ndecipherable]. And his fa
ther, and other hundred 
Jews were taken to the temple in Chernowitz, and 
they set fire to the te
mple, and they took the 
rabbi with the hundred people who were distingu
ished Jews for Chernowitz to the river Prut 
where they were killed, where th
ey were shot, all. This was in
 the beginning also, the beginning 
of July. I -- 

Q: This was -- this was -- I™m sorry -- this was 
an execution done by Germans, or by Roma nians?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0282  
9 
 
A: I suspect it was by Germans. Because this was 
-- I was told in that time, and was told by my 
friends after the war, which was [indecipherable] 
to me in Tel Aviv after the war, one of the 
sons. So the rabbi and the disti
nguished Jews were killed at 
the river Prut, by the Germans. 
Walking through the streets in -- was a -- we st
arted -- I don™t reme mber exactly the day when 
we started wearing the Jewish st
ar, and then we were only from 
10 to one, we were allowed to 
walk the streets. Being a physicia
n, I could walk to the hospital, 
to the Jewish hospital, it was 
still functioning at that time , and could walk to
 the hospital and back, but
 i-in the afternoon we 
didn™t go out because  it was very dangerous, too. Pe
ople were killed or ta
ken away to different 
labor camps [indecipherable]. So, this probabl
y wa s between June and [indecipherable] and 
around October I would say, I came in the morni
ng, it was a Saturday morning, I came to the 
hospital, to the Jewish hospital, so the direct
or of the hospital which was Dr. Neuebenham got 
the order from the authorities that the Jews have
 to be by five o™clock in the ghetto. There was no 
other order, only a spoken order. There were no 
notices. And so we were told approximately 
where the ghetto is, and we had to take whatever
 we could with us, belongings, and we went to 
the ghetto in Chernowitz. The ghetto was imme
di ately surrounded by Roma nian troops and you 

couldn™t go out or in from the ghetto, you were 
not allowed to move, only in the ghetto. And 
after a couple of days they started deporting, they 
started to take streets, 
took the sa -- the people 
from the houses, from t he apartments and direct
ly to the train stati
ons. They took 5,000 a day. 
And this went on for weeks or months [indeciph
erable]. After a week, the ma yor of -- of Tel 
Aviv -- of Tel Aviv -- of Chernowitz, Dr. Popowich, [indecipherable] Popowich said he needs 

Jews bec-because the-there is
 nobody to [indecipherable] to keep the industry working 
[indecipherable], so he needs Jews who are valuab
le for the industry to stay in Chernowitz. We  
started to apply for auth
orizations to stay in the -- in 
the city. This was up from already 35,000 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0282  
10 
 
from a population of 70,000 who wa s deported to Tr
ansnistria. I was one 
of the lucky ones who 
got the authorization to 
stay from the [indecipherable] author
izations I got from the governor of 
the -- Chernowitz who was [indecipherable]. I got 
author ization to stay in Chernowitz with my 
fa mily and so after three, four weeks, we retu
rn to our apartment, wh
ich was -- was vandalized 
and so on, with -- d-during our stay in the ghetto, 
and we started to live in the ghetto, in the -- in 
the town. We made the distinctions with the Jewish
 star, with the distinctions, the only five days 
a week to go out from 10 to one, and Saturda
y, Sunday, no Jew were -- was allowed to be on the 

street.  

Q: So should I understand that once the 
first wave of depor
tations ended -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- the ghetto wasn™t sealed any more? 

A: No, it was not, no mo re ghetto. 

Q: I understand. 
A: It was -- it was not any more the ghetto, I me a
n, Jews were living there, but ya -- others could 
go back to their homes. Some  were -- couldn™t go
 back to their apartment because it was taken 
away, but whoever was lucky got their apartment 
back. In this way we started [indecipherable] 
this winter in Chernowitz by -- th
is was ™41, and then they starte
d to send people between 19 and 
50 or whatever years to labor 
camps in Roma nia. They were 
mostly in Ro mania, the labor 
camps, in the Moldavia area, and young people we
re -- up to 50 were taken to different labor 
camps, every time a different group of people. In
 June or July 1942, one Sunday morning they 
started again to deport people from the houses 
and they deported the 5,000 people, 5,000 Jews. 
[indecipherable] them was my mother, she was deported. 

Q: Where -- where were they deported? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0282  
11 
 
A: My mother and most of these people were 
deported to Lvov. [indecipherable] Lvov, and there 
were horrible situations there. She was in a -- 
a stone group or whatever 
they call it. There were 
two locations there [indecipherable]
 but there was also surrounding th
ere, yeah they have terrible 
situations, there was no food, nothi
ng [indecipherable] and she pe
rished there [indecipherable] 
Q: Can I ask you to elaborate? Describe to us
 what did you witness during these days of 
deportations from June 1942. What happened to y
our mother, and what did you see during those 
days? 
A: I didn™t see much, they -- there was not much
 to see. They were taken to the Maccabee 
[indecipherable] and they were sele
cted, brought to the train station 
and sent to Transnistria. Sure 
there were a lot of brutalities and so on. My
 personal experience was in seeing my mother 
[indecipherable] one of [indecipherable] to stay 
in Chernowitz. So, there was a student who was 
in charge of, which was going with the group. He 
didn™t want to listen at all, and there was 
nothing you could do. I couldn™t cont
act anybody, I had some acquain
tances, lawyers, Roma nian 
lawyers which I wanted to a -- I-I went out with
out the star on this Sunday to try to reach 
some body, I  couldn™t reach anybody. So it was just 
a situation which we couldn™t -- I couldn™t 
see any brutality [indecipherable] because whatev
er happened at the -- at
 the sports arena, I 
didn™t witness. 

Q: Let me  a nnou -- a-ask you another thing about 
the same  [indecipherable]. I reme mber seeing 
the documents about the deportation of the me nta
lly insane people from Chernowitz and since -- 
Jewish people from the -- me ntally insane Jewi
sh people from Chernowitz
 and since you are an 
M.D., ma ybe you reme mber some
t hing about this incident. 
A: Yeah, they imme diately -- it was in the 
beginning they evacuated the whole me ntal 
institution, and all the patients 
and sent them away. They were deported or killed some where 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0282  
12 
 
near the river Prut, or ma ybe over the Dniest
er. I couldn™t say exactly where. I really 
[indecipherable]. 
Q: We re you able to keep in touch with your 
mother?  We re you able to communicate with her? 
A: No, no, I was not able to. I couldn™t get a
ny communication with her.
 And I [indecipherable] 
there were Roma nians who went through [indecipher
able], but I couldn™t get in touch with her. 
They were ve ry much isolated because there were other Je ws from the south of Bukavina and 

from Chernowitz who were deported the year be
fore [indecipherable] a
nd other towns, which 
were already organized and had some communica
tion with Bucharest and with Chernowitz. I 
couldn™t [indecipherable] nobody, or not to my k
nowledge could communi
cate with these people 
who were at [indecipherable]. There is 
one [indecipherable] some  Ger mans would 
[indecipherable] there over Lvov. 
They were killed over Lvov. 
Q: Can you describe to us how was your life in Ch
ernowitz during the years ™42 - ™43, the day to 
day life of the Jews. 
A: Day to day life was very difficult. Nobody [ind
ecipherable] and I have 
here to add some thing. 
We were a year under Russia, and so when the Ru
ssian came there were -- all the stores were -- 
were taken away from the population, so ther
e was no private ownership. So the people were 
already deprived a year before of all their prope
rty. When -- I™ll give you an example. If you had 
10,000 lei in 1940, you have to change it for ruble. And then when the Roma nian ca me back you 
changed the 10,000 -- the lei for one 
-- for one ruble. One ruble then became  one lei, so you lost 
all your money. So people were deprived of -- lo
st  all the -- the [indeci
pherable]. People who are 
living [indecipherable] lost, se
lling jewelry, clothing and what
ever. So it was -- nobody earned 
money and it was the population [indecipherable] whic
h at that time  I figured out even if nothing 
happens, if [indecipherable] there we re 400 or 5
00 deaths just from hung
er and from -- from 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0282

disappear. 
Q: When you are saying four -- 500 -- 

A: Jews. 

Q: Yeah. But every year, or -- 

A: Every year, yeah. No, no, I™m not talking about killings. 

Q: I understand. 

A: Killings were extra [indecipherabl e] 

Q: This was mortality.  

A: Yeah, this was mortality rate because of bad conditions. 

Q: So what happened next to you? 

A: To me , I rema ined in Chernowitz for awhile, then I was sent to one of these labor camps. It 

was Hellestend. And then later on, in 1944 -- 40 --

which was a railroad station. The daily transpor

came through this station to Bucharest or to ot her places.

. We were supposed to reinforce the bunker. 

There were, oh, I don™t know, 500 [i

out in the mornings to the evenings to work at 
the bunker. We were expose
d to the depravities of 
the -- of the guards, which was 
basically what happened. Nobody was killed, but we were beaten

up and different punishments, but nobody was really 
killed, as far as I reme mber, but there was 
very severe punishme nts. For ever
y little thing you w
ould get 25 beatings and some  were very 
severely injured. 
Q: What happened after you were in this
 forced labor detachme nt?  Did you -- 

A: I came home, I came  to Chernowitz.  

Q: You were liberated? 

A: No, not liberated. [indecipherable] 

Q: They sent you back. 

A: They sent me back after a year or  so, a
nd then, as I said, in January 1944, I got another 
assignment to -- to the station [indecipherable] it 
was a big station in the time  where ma ny na me s  
came from the [indecipherable] in the defeat of the Germans. 

Q: And there, what kind of
 for-forced labor did you -- 
A: No, there was no forced labor, I was forced 
to be the physician at 
the railroad station. 
Q: I understand.

wish. The rest didn™t know. There was a small 
village and there was the headquarters of 
the Germans there, and all kind of troops 
[indecipherable] troops and all kinds of -- 

Q: What had -- 

A: And -- 

Q: Yeah, I™m s -- I™m sorry, go ahead. 

A: Yeah, and I told -- Chernowitz wa s already 
liberated by the Russians again while I was in 
[indecipherable] and I told the commandant that
 I have no mo ney and I cannot support myself 
and he should give me permission -- and he didn™t 
know what to do with me  because he did not -

- he didn™t [indecipherabl e] to be there [indeciphe
rable] because there were [indecipherable] the 
Romanian officers and German o
ffi cers and I was called to [i ndecipherable] so it was a very -- 
how should I say it?  The situation was very unpleasa
nt. And so he gave me permission -- he gave 
me  -- to go to Bucharest to arrange my situation. 
And after a week in Buch
arest I decided not to 
go back and was able, like ma ny others in that 
time [indecipherable] I st ayed in Bucharest and 
there were small boats going from 
[indecipherable] to Palestine. 
Q: This was when, do you reme mber ? 

A: ™44. 

Q: Which months?

Q: How -- how -- I™m sorry to go back for one second, but -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- how did you arrange to leav
e?  Which organization did you -- 
A: Zionist organization. 

Q: Do you reme mber the name ?  

A: Yeah. I was -- I was me mber of a academic
 society in Chernowitz. It was a student  
organization, which was connected to the -- to 
the [indecipherable] Zionist move me nt. When I 
came to Bucharest, I was on the list from Cher
nowitz [indecipherable] Zionist [indecipherable] 
me mber of this organization, so I was one of the 
lucky one who got the -- 
the place on one of the 
boats. There were only a few boats going. I came

[indecipherable]. I reme mber exactly the date wh

in the army for 18 months. I served with th

Q: Is there anything else that you would lik
e to add concerning your wartime experience? 
A: We ll, the ma in thing is, we were living day 
by day not knowing what the war is going to bring 
you. There were -- we were always in
 danger to be beaten up or ki
lled by walking in the street. 
[indecipherable] every -- every ni
ght as a citizen. We were a 
nobody, a no person, this was really 
-- and when -- whoever survived, it was sheer lu
ck, it was no -- no special skill or  what ever. It 
was just sheer luck. You could have been ki
lled every day, everybody could have arrested you, 
everybody who ever wanted could point the fingers that you are a communist or whatever 

[indecipherable] you didn™t have
 any rights, put it this way. 
There was no rights. We were 
deprived of basic rights.  

Q: I want to thank you very much. 

A: Thank you.
