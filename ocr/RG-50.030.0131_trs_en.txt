MIRIAM LEWENT 
 October 20, 1989
 
 
 

 
Q: Would you tell me your name please?  
 

A: My name  is Miriam Lewent. 

 

Q: Where were you born?  

 

A: I was born in Poland--Zamo__--1926. June the 26th, and the year is 1926. 

 

Q: Tell me about your family, the time in Zamo__. 

 

A: Well, we have... we are three sisters, two brothers, mother and father. And we...when the war 
started, we went away from our town, Zamo__, 
to a small town. And that's where we got 
caught by the Russians...Russian Army. And we we
nt there...from there we went to another 
town, and we went to... 
 

Q: Back up. Hold it. Back up. Hold on. Back 
up. You said you went from Zamo__ to another 
town, and that's where you were caught. 
What do you mean you were caught?  What 
happened?   
 

A: We ll, we...you see Poland was divided...half Po
land and half Germany. We  were...I me an 
half Russia, half Germany. We ...I was born 
on the German side; but we wound up on the 
Russian side. And we had it very bad, becau
se we were a big family. We  had no food, 
nothing. So we tried to get back home, which 
what belonged to the German side. At that 
time, the Russians took us. There was a lot of
 people like me. They took us all; and they 
packed us in trains, you know--not passenger trai
ns--and they took us to Siberia. Thousands 
of people, you know. 
 

Q: Tell me about the trip. Describe the train and the trip.  

 

A: Well, we...we were particularly living at th
at time, waiting until we get home in a temple... A 
lot of families--about 20 families--living in 
one little temple waiting for a passport to go 
home back. But one evening--night rather, mi
ddle of night, the Russian Army came in. And 

they just start to wake everybody; and said, "Get
 up! Get up! Get up!"  And they just took us 

in trucks. And they took us to the trains, and 
we were closed in. And that's it, until in the 
morning when the trains started to roll. So we rolled for six weeks. And we passed into each 

step of the Russian country, which was... It 
was cold. And all of 
a sudden, we wound up in 
Siberia-- where there was no... I mean, the train e
nded.  This is it. Because in the meantime, 
we were so many people; and the sanitary thi
ngs were so unsanitary. There was no place to 
go to the bathroom or anything. And we had th
ree children got sick... My niece--my sister's 
daughter--at that time she was about 3 years old. She got also sick. She was among the three 

children. And by the time we stopped at the e
nd, two children died in the train. And my

sister's daughter, my niece, they took her off 
to a hospital. We couldn't go no place, because 
we were waiting for the child. So we were le
ft near Tomsk, which was Siberia. And we 
worked there; and we got the rations, bread. And...  
 
Q: What kind of work did you do?  

 

A: I worked...I was cutting trees. In order... A
nybody that didn't work, didn't get a ration of 400 
gram of bread. So, of course, every...even though I was young; but I had to go to work in 

order to get my ration. Ration. How do you say it?  
Ration, ration of bread. So I went to work 
in the taiga--you know, in the woods. A
nd we were cutting trees, you know, by hand. 
Cutting trees, putting trees together. And that's how we earned our bread and water.  
 

Q: How did you live?  

 

A: We ll, we lived... You see, they had those w
ooden houses that their prisoners lived. So they 
took them someplace else, and they gave those hous
es to us. And, of course, we used to cut 
our own wood for heating the house--which wa
s one house...was one big room, and like two 
families would live. So we would build, like 
against the wall, benches; you know, from wall 

to wall. And we slept one next to another. First of all, it kept warm; and it saved room, 

because there was no room. And there we 
would go...like we would me lt the snow for 
cooking. Cooking consisted of... I mean, if you gota pound of uh corn kernel
s, so we used to 
grind it and it became flour. And you boiled the 
water. So...in order it should be a lot. I 
mean, it was like 20 people; and everybody shoul
d get a spoonful. So it got thick. And you 
know, you would just look at; and it should get thicker and thicker, you hoped. If you didn't 

add water, so it got thicker. And everybody 
would, you know, just get a spoonful and eat. 
And that's what kept us going...kept us going, 
with the hope that some  day, you know, that 
the war will finish and we'll go back to Pola
nd. Hoping!  But when we got back to Poland, 
forget it! We  didn't even go even to our town. We  didn't go. 
 

Q: Let's hold Poland and stay in Siberia. We have time. 

 

A: Yah. We ll, Siberia, we worked. A lot of pe
ople...we didn't have any meat. So a lot of...when 
the sun went down, the light disappeared, they 
got blind. I mean, from lack of vitami ns, I 
suppose. If you don't eat meat, you don't have some  kind of vitami n and you get blind. So as 

soon the sun would set, they would get lik
e...and they would walk around like mummi es. 
And they would say, you know, "Please take me
 here..."  And young people. But they didn't 
have the meat. They didn't have all those vitami ns that one needs. And my brother was like 

this, you know; so we had to take him. But dur
ing the day, he was all right. The mi nute it got 
a little darker, forget it! They went blind. 
I don't know what it was...what would you call it. 
But that's  what happened. And, of course, wh
at, uh... You know, it was very cold there. And 

in the summer and the spring, like we would go in
 the woods, there was a lot of... We  had to 
wear veils over our faces, because there were 
big mosquitos. And if you got bitten by those 
mosquitos, a lot of people went crazy. Crazy, 
simply crazy; because I don't know what they 
had in them. So they gave us ma sks, and that's how we used to go to work.

Q: How were you treated by the population?  

 

A: We ll, uh we were not harassed, because... We ll, 
first of all, we were like in a camp. It was 
only people that were taken, like myself, 
from...you know, from Poland or whatever. And 
they put there. And we didn't see too ma ny people 
that lived there, because all we saw is the 
one that          . How do you say it?  I forgot. My husband tells me . (Laughter).  
 

Q: Prisoners?  

 

A: The prisoners. Prisoners, that's right. So we 
would see the prisoners when they came from a 
different prison. And my father used to cook the water for them, you know. It was a job. The 

cook had water. So he used to cook the hot water, and he used to put them with a cup; and he 

used to give each one a cupful
 of water. I mean, that was the disgusting thing. Just that, 

water--to share water. And you would get a pi
ece of bread, and you would soak it; and they 
would eat it. So these are the people actually 
we saw during the day. A
nd at night, we used 
to be among ourselves. Family would always s
it and dream and hope and pray that some day 
this will end, and some day we'll go home someplace. 
 

Q: Were you all together?  

 

A: Yes. Yes. We were all together; and with 
barbed wires, of course
, you could not say, "Oh, I 
don't like it here and I am going to go to a bigger town."  Of course, you couldn't do that. We 

didn't run off. As a ma tter of fact, my br
other did. My brother 
was very strong, young. And 
he did try to go away to a bigger town. They
 did catch him. They 
did bring him back. I 
mean, they didn't do anything to him. They just committed him to a crazy hospital. They told 

him that he is crazy, because he decided to run away. And that's it. 
 

Q: What happened to him in the hospital?  Do you know?  

 

A: Well, they kept him and they gave him 
some  me dication. And he did play along. He was 
very smart. He said, "Listen, if they think I 
am crazy. First of all, it keeps me out, you know, 
from the taiga, from the cutting the wood. So le
t me  be crazy."  And then if... Later on, he 
went back to the... I mean, they let him out.  
I mean, they didn't harm him or anything. They 
didn't physically abuse him. No way. But it was 
not a place for us to be. In a...in a way, it 
was good for us. We  didn't know at that time; but, you know, fate works in different ways. 
 

Q: Did you have much contact with Russian guards?  How were you guarded?  

 

A: We ll, uh there were not too ma ny guards. Th
ere were just only by the main gate. Because 
behind you were the taiga, were Siberia. Y
ou couldn't run there in the woods. Where you 

gonna go?  You gonna die there with the wolves. 
So the only thing, you had the front; and the 
front was the Russian guard. And that's a
bout it. And you had no money. You couldn't go no 
place. So you just had to stick to one place with everybody else.

Q: How long were you there?  

 

A: We were there for about a year and a half
. And then when the war started between Russia 
and...and Germany, that's when they liberated us. 
And they told us we could go wherever we 
want to go; but they told all the young men--the 
Polish, we were Polish citizens. So they told 
them they could register and go with the Russi
an Army--as a Polish citizen with the Russian 
Army--to fight against the Germans. Which 
my two brothers did. And we went to 
Kazakhstan, which is a warm climate. Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan is near Iran. 
 

Q: How did you get there?  

 

A: We ll, we... At that time, we had some ...the
y did... The Red Cross said...being we were Polish 
citizens, they did send us some sugar, tea, flour
. So, of course, we didn't need it. My mother 
sold it. And for this, we got money to get tickets to get out of there from Siberia. You know, 

just to get away. Food was... You know, food was... You know, you could get a little hungry; 

once you get out of the place that you don't 
want to be, you could always pick up 
some thing...did some thing different. So we got th
ere in Tashkent, and we worked very hard. 
Which we didn't need any clothes. We didn't 
need any shoes. We  didn't need anything. And 

we waited there for the war to be over and to go home again. 
 

Q: What did you do?  You didn't just... 

 

A: Well, there was also a big community. Because a lot of people... My family, we always stuck 
together--my sisters and brothers. But my brothe
rs were not with us, because they were in 
the Army. So it was easier, because we didn't 
need so much room, so ma ny shoes. Because 
my brother once worked in a bakery; so he used 
to work at night. So we had only one pair of 
shoes. Being he is a small guy, I was always hi
s size, even though he was older. So he used 
to sleep during the day; and I would work, use hi
s shoes. Then at night, I used to sleep and 
he would take his shoes. So...but I used to work. We  used to cut saxaul (ph) all day. Grows a 

certain branch over there, it's called saxhaul 
(ph). And this is like corn, you know. So we 
used to cut it for a price, you know, for the gove
rnme nt. And they used to give us--not pay, 
you know--the bread...300 bread...300 gram of
 bread  200...400... And that's  how you 
survive. And then when my brother went in...like when he was in the army... So he went in 

like to Germany, he would send a package to us. 
It was already after the war. So we should 
survive. So he would send shoes; so we woul
d sell it and just wait for that moment to go 
home. And we always sell the things in order 
to get the money, to always have money to go 
home. 
 

Q: You could save money?  

 

A: Well, we could...just for the train ride; because
 they wouldn't give it to you. So instead to buy 
a pair of shoes or a coat, or even some thing eat good, we had to have the money to get home.

Q: What were living conditions like in Tashkent?  Where did you live?  
 

A: We ll, we had a...those house... We  built our 
own house, so to speak. You know, we would 
dig earth with straw and--yah, cow ma nure. 
I mean, ma nure from a cow. And you step on 
it...you know, with water. And then you ma ke form
s, and you ma ke brick from it. And this 
would lay like ma ybe 4 weeks in the sun...in 
the sun... Being as tropical...you know, tropical 
climate, it dries. And this was...we made bric
ks, and we would build a house. And then we 
would ma ke a room...a house...a room. That's about
 it. And then we would ma ke a roof from 
the straw. And that's it. So if it got cooler, 
we would sleep inside; but during the summer, we 
would sleep outside on ma ts, straw ma ts. Because 
natives even there, that's how they live. 
The Uzbeks, that's how they live. They sleep outside. They eat on the ground. So we tried to 

imitate them. 
 

Q: Speaking of the Uzbecks, what were your re
lationships like with them?  The Russians?  What 
was the relationship with the Uzbeks?  
 

A: Well, we didn't see too many. Not in the beginni
ng.  Well, the Uzbeks are... Well, first of all, 
we did not understand them; because they did not speak Russian. We spoke Russian. They 

don't. And they are very family-oriented. So they
 were together, and they were farmers. And 
they grow over there me lons, all kind of me lons. And we lived on the me lons. We  did get a 

little piece of garden, and we used to grow 
me lons. And uh that's how we lived. They 
showed us. They were very nice to us, the 
Uzbeks. And they showed us how to grow, 
because we didn't know about it. And here again, we waited to go home. (laughter)  It was 

one line, but then they started... A lot of Russi
ans came when Germany started to come into 
Russia, you know. They started to occupy Russi
a. They had a lot of Russia people comi ng 

from Kiev, [from] Moscow. They
 used to bring the women, the children; and the men used 
to go to the front. So that's when we saw 
a lot of Russian people there. But everybody was 
hungry there. Even they were hungry. Becaus
e there was not too much. There was... 
Everybody had to stay with that 400 gram of br
ead, even the people that were born there. 
And that's sad. So that's what it is. But, 
of course, what my husband went through... It's... 
You cannot... But we had, because every time 
like... You know, every time my sister, she 
would have a dress. And then she would see--b
ecause she was the oldest--she would see that 
us kids that we were hungry or some thing. So
 she would take off that dress and go on the 

market. And sell it, and get--sell it for brea
d, not money. And bring home a little bread. So 
then, after a year and a half, there was not
hing to sell no more. And she got... (Laughing) 
You know, she was left with her petticoat, so 
to speak. But, Thank God, we all survived. 
I...my sisters and brothers live in Brooklyn, and 
we are happy to be in America. What can I 
tell you?  
 

Q: Tell me  about the end of the war. Your parents were with you this whole time?   

 

A: Yes, we were all the time together. All the time. 

 

Q: How did they fare with all this travelling? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0131

A: We ll, of course, it was my parents were not  old. They were older; but those years... You 
know, European people, they were not as old in 
years, but they looked older. It was...it was 
very hard, because they had to constantly 
take care of children. We were young children. But 
we tried to uh help them out as much as
 we could. Because uh, you know, they couldn't 

work. So we did work. We ...my sisters ...my...wha
tever we could. Even to go out to dig a 
ditch or pick cotton. We used to pick cott
on. Or do some thing. Just to earn some  money. 
And like the mother:  you do have respect for 
your mother and father, you know. They were 
home. Even though my father, when we lived in a place where there was a lot of Jewish 

people, he would teach them Hebrew. He w
ould teach them Jewish. He spoke very good 
Russian, very good Polish. So he would [teach
] the younger people... You see, we always 

some how wanted to learn, no ma tter how. Not myse
lf just. I think all the Jewish people are 
like this. No ma tter where they are, and what kind of thing, they always... some thing, you 

know. But among other things, you have to l
earn something, too--about the world, about 
books, about this. So my father had a job. A little 
job. Let's say, if I had a child and I wanted 
him to learn Jewish--because there was no facility otherwise--so I would give him a piece of 

bread, a pot of pickles, or whatever. And he w
ould teach the children. So he got himself... He 
loved it. And he was very proud of it; because 
when he used to come  home, he said, "You 
know, this child, he is so smart. He will so
me day be a good Jew."  You know, he predicted 

it. And uh that's how we survived, and again hoping to go home. (Laughing) 
 

Q: One more question. Wa s there in Tashkent... You're a small group of Jews. Did you form a 
sort of a mi ni-Jewish community?  
 

A: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. We  did. There were
n't too ma ny. Must have been around ma ybe 30 
families. You know, but each family had 3 or 4 
children. I mean, my father and my mother 
was a family; and they had 5 children. Or, like 
my brothers weren't with us because they 
were in the Army, you know--with the Russian
s in the Polish Army, fighting with the 
Russians against the Germans. But, of course, we formed       . I was only 15.  We  
formed...we were singing, we were
 dancing. I used to... I me an, I would have a pair of 
slippers made. Over there, you don't go in 
the store and buy. Some body ma de a pair of 
slippers. Which is... I mean, like ballet slippe
rs--no bottom or anything. But this is gold. I 

mean, this was some thing to have! And I was 
young, and I used to love to dance. So during 
the day, I would walk around barefooted. I would not
 use my slippers. But that's the slippers 
I would save for my...at night, to go dancing w
ith my friends. We  would sing Jewish, Polish-
-because this was my language at that... I was educated in Polish. And uh we would try to 

stick together. You know, you just wait a
nd ma ybe... You know, and people would have 
some  news what's going on. Of course, basica
lly, you would talk about the war, what's 

happening. And then, later on, you got to know and to learn that people are being killed. 
 

Q: How did you hear it?  

 

A: Pardonme ?  

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0131

Q: How did you hear it?  
 

A: We ll, uh I don't know. People used to come , 
like the Russians with their... Now I know. The 
people that came from Odessa, 
[from] Kiev--the Russians. Because they were evacuated to 
us, to Tashkent. They brought them over. So 
they would tell us what's happening. A lot of 
the Jews was among them, and they would tell us what was happening there. What...no 

paper or anything. The only thing is we kne
w that uh if you read... I mean, there was no 
radio. There was a radio like the main radio 
on the street; and if you walked, you listened. I 
didn't know anybody that had a radio. No way. 
 

Q: Tell me  about the end of the war. What happened to you?  

 

A: We ll, the end of the war... As 
I said, my brother was in the army. And at that time, when the 
end of the war, he just hit Breslau, which is
 Wr oc_aw. Just Germany occupied by Poland, a 
piece of Germany that Poland took. And he was 
there. And he send us tickets to go home 
from Kazakhstan. Go home to Poland. Uh we s
hould come  home. And, of course, we did go 
home. I mean, you know, it took us a long time. 
Months and months, by the time we get a 
visa. But being my brother was in the army, so 
they kind of had a little of respect for it. And 
when we got there, my brother was... Uh, we 
wanted to go to Poland where we were born; 
but along the way, you found out there is nobody ther
e. My brother wrote us a letter that 
there is nobody there. "Don't even go there. You 
will just get sick. Don't go there."  And he 
[was] stationed in Breslau. So he got us an apartment, and he... That's where we came, to 

his...to his apartment. From Russia to ther
e. But along the way... I mean, we stopped comi ng 

from Russia to Kiev because we had...because th
is was Ukraine. Then we went...from Kiev 
we went to Lemberg [
NB:
 Lwów]. And uh we waited on the trains, you know; because you 
had to have clearance to go through. So you have 
to get some water. And the trains... I mean, 
it was not the trains...trains... It was a very unc
omfortable trains. So if I would go down for 
water, to get from the pump some  water... Fi
rst my father would go down. And my father 

wore a beard--Jewish--so he encountered some  unpleasant, you know, talk about him. So 

they decided, being I looked more like a Chris
tian, not a Jewish... So 
I was sent out, and I 

would hear... They would say, "Well, Russia is gi
ving us Jews and we are giving them coal." 

You know Russia took out all the coals from 
Poland, and they send in the Jews to Poland. 
So we decided this is it. We are going to go to America. And my mother had a brother...a 

sister here. And we started to
 find out where she was. And finally, we did. And with God's 
help, we came here. And I love every mi nute of it. God bless America! 
 

Q: Tell me  about how you me t your husband. 

 

A: Oh, when I got here in July... Of course, he 
had to go to work right away to get something. I 
went to work, and then... I  don't know. Must have
 been fate or something. I decided to go to 

a school, where he lived near the school. I 
didn't know about it. On
 90th Street [and] 
Broadway. And I lived in the Bronx, and I worked
 in Manhattan; but I went to school to 90th 
Street. Why?  I don't know what ma de me  do it. So
 I went there. And, of course, he was in a 
different class and I was in a different cl
ass. We  were young, and we got to know one

another. And that's how love started. (Laughter)  Some thing, I don't know. 
 
Q: Okay. Thank you. 

 

A: You're quite welcome. Thank you. Nice meeting you.
