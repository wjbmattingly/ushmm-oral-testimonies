[Applause]
 
>> Agi Geva:  Goodmorning. 
 
>> Bill Benson: T hank you so muchfor yourwi llingness to join us today andbeour
 
F i rs
t 
Person
.  You have som uch to tell us in abrief  one
-
hour period sowe'll get right into it.
 
 
W orldW ar II began, of course, with Germ any' s invasion of Polandon Septem ber
 
1 , 
1939.  Butbefore we turn to the war
 
and
 
theHolocaust, let's start wi th you sha
rin g a  lit t le  b it  
about yourf am ily, your  community, and yourself in those years before the war began.
 
>> Agi Geva:  In 1936, three yearsbefore the war reall y began,m y 
father
 
wasf ired.  Jews 
couldn't be in key positions anym ore. It was still f araway f rom  the real anti
-
Sem itism  and 
problem s thathappened later. So he took it very, very badly.  He had aheartattack.  He 
hardly recoveredf rom it.  He couldn't work anym ore.  So m y motherhadto take over the 

responsibility of  the fam ily.  So we had tom ove f rom  our hom e where we gre w up. W e went to 

Miskolc.  She openeda small hotel there. Itwas ver y successf ul. W ehad a very good nam e.  

T he hotel was im portant.  Many people cam e to visit.  She really m anaged. My f ather justhad 

t o  he lp  a lit t le  b it,
 
not toom uch. T he one year the doctors said he would stay alive, he stayed 
another nine years after all of  hisproblem s.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You told m e that inthose early pre
-
war days that you were very full of 
patriotism f or Hungary.  Can you say m ore about that?
 
>> Agi Geva: W e liked the country until then. They sentus away.  Really didn't see any
 
m or e  
Hungarians.  I was at every school celebration, actually talking aboutthe Hungarians andthe 

Hungarian way.  I love the language.  It was really good at thatpoint. Then the Hungarians 

were the last to be deported.W e thought it wouldnever get tous. W ealways said, no, this 

wi ll never happen in Hungary what is happening.
 
>> Bill Benson:  As we noted earlier, the war began when Germany and Russia in
vaded 

Poland in Septem ber
 
1939.  Butf or your comm unity andfor Jews in Hungary, thef ull effect of 
the war didn't really happen until the spring of 1944. Tell us about that period between the

4
 
start of the war in Septem b
er
 
1939and bef ore the 
Na zis  c a m e t
o Hungary.  A lengthy period.  
W hat was that likef or you and yourfam ily? W hat took place then? 
 
>> Agi Geva: W e didn't see anti
-
Sem itism , actually, ver y m uch. I think it was apparent
 
--
 
we  
hadnoaccessto thenewspaper. W e really didn't know it. W e
 
hada very happy childhood.  It 
was ver y peaceful, actually. W e were sent to the 
P
rotestant school. There was no Jewish 
school in Miskolc. T he Jewish attendance was ver y lo w
, o
nly two Jewish girls.  W e didn'tf eel 
actually all of  the
 
--
 
how shall I tell you? T heothers, Romania, Austria, it still didn't get to us.  
T hat's why m y parents also thought that Hungar y would never notice what happened.
 
>> Bill Benson:  During that time didn't someof  yourf am ily m embers leave Hungary and 
em igrate elsewhere du
ring that tim e? 
 
>> Agi Geva:  T hey were pessim istic. T hey just tried to leave Hungary.  They lef tfor Palestine.  

My aunt andm y uncleand fam ily.  Only oneswho lef t. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  During that period, again, where the war really hadn't come to Hunga
r y fu l l y,  

you rem em ber during that time
 
--
 
let me rephrase that.  Did you know what 
wa s
 
happening to 
Jews elsewhere in Europe?  Do youthink your fam ily was a ware of  that?
 
>> Agi Geva:  Not exactly.  Even, let's say, wouldn't have known.  My sister was 13,
 
I was 14 
at the tim e, wouldn't have known
 
about the 
m eaning
,  
the deportation m eant, the word 
concentration meant.  So we heard about it. Alwa ys the slogan was the Hungarians will 

never
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  It won't happen here. And, of course,all of that changed in Marchof 1944.  

March 19 isa very, ver y signif icant datefor you.
 
>> Agi Geva:  On the 19thof March in them orning m y dad died. He died in the morning. My 

m other called the relatives in Budapest.  Everybody f rom thef am ily.  She calledthem  to com e 

to thefuneral.  My uncle arrived.  He has a Hungarian name likeany other name.  It wasn't 

connected with the Nazis but m y m other understood.  She got the second of the day and didn't 

know how to tell it to us, that som ething dramatic happened. 
 
W e went to thef uneral,only m y 
m other andm y sister. Nobody could com e. And then we came back f rom thefuneral. On 

ever y corner was already a German soldier would come. So it wasa shock and a dramatic 

change.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Ithappened alm ost instantly, didn't it?
 
>> Agi Geva:  T he day before we didn'teventhink.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Do you think your m otherand otherf am ily m em bers had any idea atthatpoint 

what would happennext? 
 

>> Agi Geva:  I don't think anybody could even im agine what was happening next.  It was very 

gradual. W e gradually felt the im pact what itm eans to be an occupied country. T hat week m y 

m other sentus to a small village, to af riend'shouse,for protection.  She thought. But we 

didn't feel protected.
 
 
T he lady of the housewas desperate, hiding Jews.  T hat's how shelooked at it.  She 
wouldn't let us out of the house
, e
ven to look in the window.  She was sof rightenedand we 
were so sad. W e were grie ving at m y father. W ecouldn't observe. Ever ything changed.She 

told 
everyone to com ehome. W ecan't stay awa y. W e want to be wi th her.  And that was a 
real problem becauseJews couldn't leave the house without the yellow star on the jacket or 

clothesor whatever yo u were wearing.  And it was a problem  to leave the house without and to 

leave thehouse with. 
 
 
She stayed with us after my dad died.  She wanted
 
to com eto the village and builda 
home. W e were worri ed. W hen she came,we had to decide with the yellow star on our 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
5
 
clothesor without. W e decided without.
 
 
W e  we
re sitting in the train.  The Hungarian gendarm e, the Germ ansoldiers, they 
cam e and they lookedat every person who was sitting in thosetrains. T hey let people show 
their papers. They let people get off thetrains whosef ace they didn't like.  It was a
 
traum a 
until we arrived.  T hey looked atus but somehow didn't askf or papers and didn't get 

su sp icio u s.  

 
If we had
 
been caughtwithin Siberia
 o
r ourpapers they didn't like, wouldhave been 
the same. That's why we decided to risk it without.
  
So we got
 
toour house safely.  At least 
thatperiod was over.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Ism y m em ory correct that that happened on your birthday?  Ok. In the m iddle 

of  June,tell usabout whathappenedon yourbirthday and then, of  course, whathappened 

once you were back
 
in  Mis k o lc .
 
>> Agi Geva:  Actually, after we got back to Miskolc, there were notes of  what we are 

supposed to do.  O
neof  them was we had to give our [Indiscernible] to themunicipality and 
our bicycles, which is som ehow unheardof . Jewish teenagers have
 
bicycles. W hen we gi ve 
them  to them unicipality, there was a notealso that those who were 
l
oyalty to Hungary wou ld 
not have to be
 
--
 
will not be deportedand will  work in thef ields.  Sowe thought anything wi ll do 
not to be deported.  By that time we knew wh at the word meant. 
 
 
Som y m otherf ound som e 30, 35 very goodfriends who were ready to go to the 
m unicipality who were 
l
oyalty to Hungary.  T hey were taken tothef ields to thef arm s, village.  
W e worked there f rom  5:00
 
in them orning until late at night.  My feet were hurting.  I never 
knew bef ore what it meant. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  And you're 14 years old.
 
>> Agi Geva:  14.  My sister was 15.  And we thought it was a hard lif e but better than to be 

taken, to be deported. Butone day the rule changed,
 
the law changed. They changed their 
m inds, the Hungarians, and they sent the gendarmes and the German soldiers tobring us 

back to the town.
 
 T
hey told usonthe way
 
there was an air raid.  You were supposed to lief lat and
 
--
 
they couldf ind you in the fields.  The air raiddidn't touch usthis time, actually.
  
W e stopped at 
a small village. W e were all taken to the police station. The womenwere lef toutside. The 

m en got taken inf or interrogation. W e just heard their scream s. T hey were badly, badl
y 
beaten.  T hey
 
wantedtof ind outf rom  them  where were the jewels, m oney, bank accounts, 
and so on. They were supposedtotell it all. 
 
 
T hen we were taken not back to ourhouses in Miskolc, we were taken to the ghetto. 
W hat means ghetto isnot well
-kn o
wn, I suppose.  Not all of you can even know the word.  It 
was a ver y, very popular placeduring the war.
  
Inthe ghetto with the Polish people. Only a 
fe w we e ks. T h atm e an t ou t of the  city.  P
artof  the town was f enced off .W e couldn't go over 
the fenc
e. W e couldn't leave.  We couldn't go out walking.  You were supposed to stay in the 
houses.
 
 
Now, the housesm eant sm all,two
-
room  apartm ent, a couple, m aybe one child. 
T hey brought us inf ive, six f am ilies into this sm all apartm ent with one bathroom , o
ne  k i t c hen ,  

onebedroom . W e were very uncomf ortable,ver y stressed, very wo rried, very hungry, ver y 

thirsty, ver y e ver ything.  W e thoughtthat theworst part couldhavehappened to us and we 

hoped it wouldbeover soon. 
 
 
It wasn't the worst. We were taken out of the ghetto. They cam etothebrick factory.  
T he brickfactory, it was on the railroad station.  It had a roof.  It had no sides. People could 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

escape, actually.  There were m any guardsbut still.  Andm y m other was encouraged todo so, 
to takem y sister andm eand just walk out. She was af raid.  She was af raid that she would be 

discovered.  She wasaf raid. So she stayed. She regretted it all her life.
 
 
My goodf riend escaped and we m et her af ter the war.  So it was possible to survi ve.  
 
 
W e 
were waiting f or trains. We thought, ok, trains. T rains will be lik e the trains we 
knew
: s
i
tting, looking out the window, having a sandwich.  But when thetrains came, it was a 
far cry f rom what we saw.  They were cattle cars.  And we thought they just c
am e by
 a
nd 
would
 
go.  Butthey did not. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Letme ask youone question.  Did youhave any senseof  where those trains, 

those cattle wagons, where they were to takeyou?  Did you have any sense of that at that 

t i m e ? 
 
>> Agi Geva:  No idea.  No idea. W ethoughtit would takeus out of the country.  It was scary.  

W edidn't wantto geton those cars but they pushed uson. T he Germ ans and the Hungarian 

gendarmes, they helped usup the very high steps. And even the ghettos we had af loorat 

le a
st. There was nothing on thef loor. They put in asm any peopleas they could and closed 
the doors on us. 
 

 
Happy to be back in the ghetto, of course. W e thought worse
; t
here was nothing 
worse.  T here were ver y old people in that certain wagon, boxcar.  There were very young 

people. There were babies.  There were pregnant wom en. T
here were teenagers.  Anybody
 
who was in that groupandeverybody reacted diff erently.  There were people who started to 

scream , couldn't stop scream ing. They were hysterical.
  
Kids just didn't know what was 
happening.  How could this be possible?T his is nothum an even.There were babies who 

couldn't stop crying, of  course. There were wom en whof ainted. T here was nowhere tofaint 

to. W e couldn't even sit down.  And the trainstartedtom ove. And there was a very sm all 

windo w, ver y sm all one under the roof . Thatgave us a little bitof  indication when it is night 

and when it is day. W e didn't know how m any days we were in thishorrible conditions, onthis 

wa go n .  It too k
 
three days
.  T
hey told us later.
 
 
W hen thedoorsopened and we had to get off the wagon, they im mediately 
separatedthe menf rom  the wom en. It was oneof  the worst things I can really im agine.  

Brothers,mothers, it was impossibletodescribe what itm ea
nt to be separated f rom one 

another. But there was nothing todo about it. W e were at gunpoint all the time.
 
 
And then the wom en started tom ove to a certain space to a certainpoint.  And this 
tim em y m other really got worried.  She regretted shedidn't
 
escape.  She regretted that she 
got up to this point. She told us to walk slowl y, to stay with the crowd.  We weref ive in a row.  

And she would go through thef ront and seewhat's happening inthef ront
 t
o decide what to do. 
 
 
She gotto thef ront and saw what was happening and slowly, slowl y she came back.  
She could get back tous and tell us thefollowin g.  
ﬁ
Don't ever call m em om  or sister sister.  
Fam ilies shouldn't be together.
ﬂ
  
T hat's whatshe saw there.  Someone said, 
ﬁP
lease let me 
s t a y wit h  m y
 
mom,
ﬂ 
with m y daughter, they were imm ediately separated.  One went to theleft 
side. T he other was sent to the right side.  My m otherdidn't know at that time what theother 

side meant. W efound out m uch later.  
 
 
But she saw that we are not supposed to
 
be young, not supposed to be 13 and14 
because 13 and14 years old were sent immediately to the lef t side.
  
So she told us to put on 
our scarves
 
--
 w
e bothhad scarves
 
--
 a
nd bind it ina certain way that it would makeus older.  
W eshould say that we are
 
18 and19. And under no conditions say
 
--
 
she saw the way we 
were binding our scarves would makeus look older. Itm akes me look older even now.

>> 
[Laughter] 
 
>> Agi Geva:  T hen she bound her scarf  inadifferent way that made her look younger. And 
th
at was that way.  It might have helped. Something helped.
 
>> Bill Benson:  One ofthe things that we're learn
in g
 
f rom  you today but you can'teven begin 
to tellus adequately is how extraordinarily
 
--
 
j ust how extraordinary your m other was.  And to 
be able to size that upandadjust like that was rem arkable. And there are other incidents like 

th a t. 
 
You told m e about a f riend of  yo
urs, your best f riend, Edith.  Can you say a littlebit about 
that?
 

>> Agi Geva:  Yes. W e were two Jewish girl s in the classroom .  Edith was m y bestf riendand 

other Jewish gir l.  And her mother was sent to the lef t im mediately at this point than whenm y 

m otherfound out inorder to stay together.  And this time she didn'teven think what side it 

should bebut we should stay together.  And she would accompany us all the way.
 
 
T he next day, Auschwitz, com eback to the selection.  But thenext day that came, 
trucks with loud speakers telling every girl un der 16 should come tothe trucks tobe in better 

treatm ent, better sleeping quarters, betterfood.  Anda lotof  girls started to runto thetrucks, 

also me andm y sister.  My m other caughtusandtoldno way.  It doesn'tm atter that you will 

have better treatment, betterf ood,better whatever, you stay with m e.  You stay with m e.  
And 

Edith, youdon't go anywhere.  You stay with thefam ily andI will look after youas I look after 

m y own daughters. But Edith didn't want
 
to listen to her.  She said, " I
f  I go , I m igh t m ee t m y 
mom.
  
M
aybethis is wherem y m om  is staying.
ﬂ
  
She didn't 
lis t en  
to  
us.  Idon't have to tell you 
that we never saw her anym ore.W ef ound out later what happened to her. 
 
 
I always told you therewas nothing worse, the worst was to com e. W e were ledtoa 
big hole. W e were supposed to put down ourbags.  Now, what were  in the bags? We hada 

sm all bag. W e were told when we went to the farm that we couldput in it whatever we can 

carry.  So it shouldn't be too heavy, too weak.  SoI put in
 
--
 
[feedback]
  
I pu t te en a ge  stuff .I 
don't know what m y sister had. So
 
when wehadto give our bags, it was not sotragic.  
Howe ver, it m eanta lot to us because it was our only connection with hom e yet.  So we put it 

in the corner. 
 
But thegro wnups, they had inthese bags jewels,f amily pictures, docum ents, 
ver y im portant stuff and they got really hyster ical.  They were beggi ng the guards. T hey were 

crying.  T hey were doing whatever they could. T hey had to leave it.  Gunpoint.  You haveto 

put itdown.  So it was ver y hard
 t
hat act.
 
 
T he next one was worse.  W e had toundress. W e had to undressand leave 
ever ything you hadonto put inanother corner, shoes, everything.  And this time it turned out 

thatall the grownups thoughtof  thebags that were takenaway f rom them  butthey 

rem em bered that there is another way.  So they sewed in their clothes
 
--
 
to show how and 
where

in the pockets, in the lining, inthedresses, them oney, pictures, documents, things to 
buy f reedom  with,f ood with. W ehad totakeoff  these dresses.  Everything we had to takeoff .  

Som y m other and herf riends had really nothing left. Their lasthope was done, to 
be able to 
buy som e life work, 
f r ee d om .
 
 
W e were standing there without clothes. As if this wasn't enough,they came to 
sh a v
e usf rom all hairon our bodies. It was them osthum iliating
 
thing I have ever had.  Later 
cam e other onesbutthat was this time. Andwe were led tothe showers.
 
 
Af ter thattim e we couldn'tf ind out what itmeant to be inthe showers.  W e were so 
lucky that water cam efrom  the showers.  Becauseonthe other side, on the lef t side where 

people were sent, gascam e from  the showers.  And this we didn't know.  Luckily.
  
T hen my 
m otherfound out. She was ver y caref ul thatm y sister and I shouldn't know aboutthis, we

should neverf ind out about this. She didn't want
 
to spoil our security in a way and to make 
us
 
--
 
we never f ound out.  In the liberation we really didn't know.  She knew everything.  And by 
knowing it, she could shield usf rom all of this
, a
ll of  this tragedy.
 
 
So that was actually the f irst day.  Andthen we were sent to the barracks where we 
got two blankets.  I rem em berf ood.  My sister says, no, we had no food. Everybody 
rem em bers other stuff.  But everything was gr ay, the blankets, thebarracks, the place, theair, 

the sm oke that we didn't know where it cam e f rom and we didn't know why it was gray and 

what it m eant. 
 
 
In the barracks we had these bunks. My m other told us,ok, that's what we have. I 
sleepon them iddle. My sister on topand Iwas on the lower one.W ethought that'show it will 

be
. But, no. T hey put another six, seven people on the sam e bunk. And if som ebody stirred,
 
all the six peoplehad to turnand soon.  I'm  not going to get intom ore details of this tim e. 
 
>> Bill Benson: T here's so muchmore you could say but I know yo u want totell us what 

happenedaf terthat.  You were sent toPlaszow f rom  there, to very hard labor. T ell us about 

th a t.
 
>> Agi Geva:  T here were afew days in Auschwit z, m ight befew we eks, two weeks, I think.  

T hen we were sentback to the railroad station, back into the wagons.  And the wagons took us 

for a one
-
day trip. W ewere sent to Plaszow.  Now, Plaszo w is the place where S
c h ind le r' s lis t  
was taken. And Plaszow was the place where the inm ates were
 
c rim in a ls ;  
not like us who 
c a m ef r om  t he  c i
t ie s  a
nd other countries. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Murderers and 
--
 
>> Agi Geva:  Murderers.  W e were so scared
.  F
rom the morning totheevening we were just 
looking
 
behindus, who is behind us. We were very, ver y scared.  And the work was not only 
hard, it was absolutely excruciating.  Big rocks, a quarry, Plaszow.  W ehad totake the big 

rocks up thehill.  And the next day we had tobring it back down. 
 

 
Now, if  som ebody didn't choose rocksbig enough
 
--
 
like  m y sist e r wa s 1 3
. R
e a lly 
how big a rock could she carry?
  
So she chose a sm aller one.  Shewas ver y, very badly 

beaten.  And,of  course, we couldn't help her because we were notallowed to say mother, 

sister. W e never spoke about the relationship.  Nobody knew thatwe are family.
 
 
So thistook quite a while.  W e were ver y beaten. Very desperate. W hen we heard 
shelling, we thoughtmaybe the Russiansarenearing and liberating us.  But theGermans 

heardthis, too, of  course.  Andthey knew wh at's happening. T hey liquidated the cam p.
 
 
So they tookus back to the station.  Again inthe wagons, traveling som ewhere. W e 
hadno idea whereto.My sister and I were crying the whole tim e.W ecouldn't stop anym ore.  

Som y m other kept telling if you were in the worst place, you were in Auschwitz, and the worst 

place, we were in Plaszo w, there is no worse
 
place than these two places so don't worry.
 
W etried not to worr y.  When thedoorsopened and we saw where we were taken, it was the 

end.  It was Auschwitz.
 
>> Bill Benson: T hey took you back to Auschwit z. 
 
>> A gi  G e va
:  T ook usback to Auschwitz.  And thenm y m other
 
--
 
there was nothing m oreshe 
could say.  T here would be selections. There was one officer selecting.  And the oneoff icer 

who was selecting was 
Mengele
.  I can't even say the doctor. He was the worst, th
e  c r ue l es t  
personever.  He was called the angel of death. 
 
My m other really got scared.  She toldus, 
look, two things, eitheryou follow m e wherever he sendsm e or you say you want to work, you 

want to be in the working cam p.  Germ ans need workers.  Sothism ight save you. 
 

 
So she said she's going first andm y sister af ter her andI shouldbethe last because 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD

I really looked very weak.  So she was sentto the right side im mediately.  My sister behind her.  
Also tothe right.  And I came inf rontof him . 
 
He toldm e lef t side. I told him , 
ﬁN
o,no.  I would 
like to go there.
ﬂ 
>> Bill Benson: T his is to Mang
e le
? 
>> Agi Geva:  And hewas alone but there were lotsof  soldiers with guns aroundhim ,
 
surrounding him . It was there
 
I told him  the working camp.  
H e sa ys ,  
ﬁY
ou don't look to m e that 
you can still work.
ﬂ
  
And thenhe realized that we were talking Germ an.  Andthis is the point I 
want to tell you that m y father knew that som ething was going to happen.  He knew som ething 

ver y bad would com e. He told m y sister and I one day and told usthat you have to know 

som ething that can'tbe takenaway from you and this will be languages.  And this will give you 

power.  And the knowledge will gi ve you power.  And he thought if we knew f luent Germ an and 

English by the ageof 14.  So hadn't I known Germ an thatday, I really wouldn't be sitting here 

today. 
 
 
So Mangel
e  
askedm e, " how do you know Germ anthat well?"   Itdidn't matter 
anym ore.  He told m e, 
ﬁO
k, go where you wa nt to go.
ﬂ
  
It was unbelievable.  My m otherf
ainted 
when she saw the conversation.  She was sure she wouldnever, ever seem e again. She 

didn'teven know that I was sent toher, to that side,because she was fainting when I got there. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  You told m e that when you sharedthis with audiences in thepast, peoplewi ll 

of ten ask you weren't you scared of Mangele,to talkthat way to him .
  
Tell theaudience what 
you told m e.
 
>> Agi Geva:  I don't know.  I was af raid ofmy m other.
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
>> Agi Geva:  She told m e to dothis. W e realized we do whatever she say.
 
 
But then another hum iliation,of  course.W hynot? W e were tattooed like cattle, just 
like that. T hey put the numberon our arm s.  It was hurting.  It was more hurting the knowledge 

thatthey kept on telling us, "Y
ou have no nam es f rom  today.  You are just num bers."   It was 
hum iliating.  It was very hurtful. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  You would continueat Auschwit z f or a while longeruntil late 1944.  And then 

you were sentf or the last timef rom Auschwitz to dom ore slave labor. T ell us where youwere 

taken.  And you were still together at thistim e. W heredid you gof rom  Auschwitz?  T ell us 

about that. 
 
>> Agi Geva:  T here were selectionsevery d ay.  Germ any neededworkers in f actories.  So 

som etimes they looked at strongf eet, strong hands.  But sometimes they looked at eyes. And 

I wore glasses f rom  the age of 5.  So m y mom  putm y glasses sidewa ys in her shoe, thatI 

shouldn't look different.  And som ehow during the selections we stayed togetheragain.  And 

we were sent to the railwa y station. W e were sent out of Auschwitz.   This time we hoped we 

would never com e back to Germ any. 
 

>> Bill Benson:  And that's where you went toRochlitz.
 
>> Agi Geva:  T o Rochlitz, a sm all town. W ewere studying there how to m akeairplane spare 

part
s, sm all screws.  And then they ga ve m ea pencil and apaper and a table anda chair. I 
couldn't believe. It was thef irst time I saw a tableandthef irst time I sat on a chair since we 

were deported. They gi ve m e thepencil. They handedm ea pieceof
 
bread.  It m ade m e feel 
in spiteof m y num ber that I'm  just anum ber, it mademef eel humanand responsible again.  It 

wasn't over.
 
>> Bill Benson:  But that didn't last long either.
 
>> Agi Geva:  No.

>> Bill Benson: W here were you then taken?
 
>> A gi  G e v
a: W e were taken to Calw, to a big f actory where the real
 
--
 
if  I told you it was the 
worst, the worst, the worst, I can't im agine som ehow could be som ething worse.  To stand 
hours on your f eet, at night, listening to the m onotone noise of  the m achines an
d stay awa
ke
.  
How could we stay awake at nightm aking these sm all screws? W e couldn't.  Until one girl  fell 

asleep really andfell into them achine. She was badly hurt.  It was a wake
-
up call f or all of  us.  
So we stayed awake. But it was a struggle that I can'tdescribe. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  And while you were at Calw, your rem arkable mother, if  I understand correctly, 

began engaging in little actsof  sabotage.
 
>> Agi Geva:  Yes.  Ithappenedby chance thef irst part of it. I was m aking the screwsf rom  a
 
plan they drew f orm e, f rom  a small piece of alum inum  colum n. My s ister was in at the 

controls. They were controlling if they are too big, too small, or just right.  And m y mother was 

at the bigf iling stone,filing down the screws in case they were a little bitbigger than 

acceptable.  Andone som ehow the stone exploded.  She got so scared that shefainted.  And 

they called her to the headquarters, the Comm andant, who explained to her that these stones 

are very, ver y delicate and you can'tpress the screws harder because then they explodeand 

that isa big problem.  You can'tf inda new one.  You have to orderoneand orders arenot so 

easily com ing by.  Until the stone com es, all the screws were in thecrates waiting to be sent 

out.
  
Oh, she thought thatm ight be a good idea. She can maybe help a little bit toendthe war.  
So she kept doing this ever y now and then.  She would push the screw harder to the stone, 

stone exploded,m other fainted.
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
>> Agi Geva:  T hey never f oundout.
 
>> B ill B
enson:  I wasgoing to say.  Did 
you 
know she was doing this?
 
>> Agi Geva:  No.  We never foundout.  Shewas af raid.  She didn'ttrust anybody.  She did it 

butdidn'ttrustanybody. Wefound out only m uch later, af ter the liberation. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  And Agi, in February, f inally in February 1945, you're takenout
 
of  Calw but 
this time you're sent on a forcedmarch which really was a Death March. T ell us about that 

and what youthoughtwas going to happenand where you went. 
 
>> Agi Geva:  Can you im agine something worse than traveling in these wagons?  It was the 

worst of  the worst totravel in this
,  
these wagons with noplace, no space.  I can'teven tellyou 
with no what.  But thiswas worse. 
 

 
T hey told usto get ready, we are going. W eunderstood our lifem ight be nearing 
but we couldn'thave im agined where we wo uld be going and how we were going.  So we were 

standing at the door innight
 
--
 
all thetim e. T hey kept on counting. In Auschwit z it was the 
m ostoccupational, let's say
,  
fo r th em .
 
>> B i l
l Benson:  Line upf or hoursand hours. 
 
>> Agi Geva:  And here they lined usup.W e were waiting f or a carriage,for a car,for a 

coach,f or something.  T hey said go.  Go where? T here was nothing. W hat do youm ean 

nothing?  You walk.  You go. 
 
 
W e wan t
ed back the wagon.  Im agine we wis hedbackfor the wagon. W e just had 
to leave inthis cold night in Germany, windy, cold. W ehad nothing
 
--
 
I didn'tm ention that the 
f irst day when we had to undress and shower and we were shaved, I didn'tmention two th
i ngs .   

On e
,  
that we were sprayed also. More hum ility.  And after the spraying we had to walk to 
another corner and choose clothes. W hat isclothes?  Onedress and one shoe, no stockings, 

no underwear.  So that's what we had on. 
 
So I ran back and took my
 
blanket.

>> Bill Benson: T his is the deadof  winter.
 
>> Agi Geva:  In the m iddleof  winter.
 
>> Bill Benson:  An especially brutal winter as it turned out.
 
>> Agi Geva:  And we walked. W e walked step
-
by
-
step in very bad shoes that didn't f it and 
were 
wo
rn
 
out already. W e were so cold. T he wind was so strong. W esaid, 
ﬁW
al k ?
ﬂ
  
W e 
wish the wagons back.  
 
 
So we walked for 400
 
kilom eters every night.  And thenm orning cam e, they were 
af raid the villagers would seeus so they f ound usbarns.W e were supposedto sit in the 

barns. W ho could sleep would sleep. W ehad nof oodor water.  So we were lookingf or 

som ething.  I remem ber we foundpotatopeels.  Hardly any water.  W e were weak, even. Not 

only cold, we were ver y weak.  And, of course, we couldn't sleep so we were sleepy.  Andyou 

were walking when the evening came and we were sent out of these barns.We were sleep 

wa lk in g.  
 
 
T hen they kept telling us
 w
alk quicker.  If you want to go by train,ok, walk quicker.  
W eare going toa railway station. W e will get the wagons.
 
 
T here were another two girls who understood German.T henews cam e back to 
ever ybody gir l by girl that we arenot going to walk by wa gons. T hewagons, the trains 

bringing the guns to execute usand ordered to do so.
 
 
I couldn't walk anym ore quicker than I was walking.  I couldn't walkeven anym ore.  It 
cam e apoint when I just sat down and thought no, no,no,I can't
;  
I just can't. And then I 
rem em beredhearing that there were DeathMarches. W hy were they called Death Marches?  

B
ecausem any people, m any prisoners, whocouldn't walk anym ore, really couldn't walk 
anym ore, satdown at the side orfell down tothe side of the road and they were shot. 
 
 
W e were 199 wom en. One wom an diedf rom T yphus in Calw.  Nobody else got it, at 
le a
st. So we were still 
1
99. W e just kept onwalkin g.  And when we heard what was going to 
happen, part of us believed it, som edidn't believe it.  I didn't care.  Ireally didn't care whether I 

was shot or would die just like that
.  
I just couldn't walk an
ym ore.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Atthat point was your m other still able to encourage you to keep going? 
 
>> A gi  G
eva:  Yes.  She kept telling us 
--
 
also when we were leaving thefactory, she kept us
 
--
 
notbeing happy, being normal by telling us stories all the time. Stories about what was and 

stories what she thinks will be.  Shealways to ld us what we ate when we were still at home, 

what m eans home. And she told us when wecom e back, we wil l have all of thisback. 
 
 
I never believed we would be liberated.  Ipersonally really didn't believe it. T hen she 
keptus going.  She told us so many encouraging ideas shehad while we were walking until 

she heard where we were walking, that we m ight beexecuted.  So she just couldn'tencourage 

us to go anym ore but we had
 
to. W e were at gunpoint.  Rem em ber, all this tim e we had 
guards aroundus with guns.  And then we arrived to the railway stati on, itturned out
 
--
 
t he  
order was to execute us butthey had no guns. W ef ound outm uch later. 
 
 
An off icer with an envelopefrom the stationmaster. W e foundout later we were to 
go over to Switzer land.  And the soldiers who were just guarding us,they sentus back to the 

forest. They told
 
--
 
they didn't tell usthat there areno guns toexecute you, of course. But 
they toldus you m issed the train, you have to keep on walking.  I think that was the most 

desperateday during the whole year of m y life. T hat was the worst of  the worst to go back into 

theforest, in the cold.  There were creeks we hadto cross. T he shoes were not shoes 

anym ore. My f oot was bleeding. T his was the worst day.  I just satdown andtoldnomore, 

never m ore.  But,of  course, we had to.  Andm y m other kept going. I don't know what else she

12
 
could tell us to keepme going butI did. 
 
 
W hen we  go t  b a c k
 
to the forest, af ter a while, somehow af ter som e walkin g, one of  
theelders said the kapo, the leader
 
--
 
there were plenty people, Hungarians, and the Polish 
people were the onesbetween theGermansandus, they got the clothes. T hey got thefood.  
T h e y 
divided us.  Andoneof  them , theolderone, she told,

ﬂ
  
And 
then she told me these words.  
ﬁ
From  now on, 28of  April
 
1945 you are
ﬂ 
--
 
and she hadno 
heart to tell the words
 Œ  ﬁ
f ree.
ﬂ
  
Until we realized what she told, we looked
 
around, there were 
no guardsaroundus. There was noone guarding us. 
 
>> Bill Benson: T heyhad just disappeared. 
 
>> Agi Geva:  And she toldus we aref ree.  So the desperate worst day of  my life becam ethe 

best. I was so happy.  I didn't actually know what to do.  My sister didn't care.  She just sat 

down, opened her bag, tookout all thefood there was in it becausewe hadf oraf ew days but 

we were not allowed to touch it. She satdown and startedtoeat.  She didn't care.  Until 

som ebody warned m y
 
m other. She remem bered that afterhunger and starving, it's the wor st 
thing you can do, t
o start eating.  People d
ied
f
rom  this.  So they stopped her.  
 
 
And then what? W earef ree.  So what? W hat todo? 
 
W e are in Germ any.  It's 
win te r.  It's co ld .W
e have nothing.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And the war is not over.
 
>> Agi Geva:  And thewar is not over.  Exactly.  And we were 179 Hungarians with 179 

opinions. 
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
>> Agi Geva:  Ever ybody has adiff erent idea.  One told stay put, the other west, one 
east, one 

told waitf or the daylight.  Everybody had some other idea. 
 
 
My m other gathered som e 30 people around her. They discussedwhat to do.  And 
these 30 people, 30
-
som ething people, agreed what todo.  And we startedout in a certain 
direction.  W e 
didn't wait.
 
>> Bill Benson: W e'reclose to the end of ourtim e. I know you're getting there. T ell us about 

theencountering the U.S. soldiers.
 
>> Agi Geva:  Yes.  So we were walking.  And then we were scaredby hearing voices. W e 

thought, oh m y God, we are getting back into German hands.  If not the Russians,m ight be 

anyone else,m ight beany soldiers.  And then we were supposed tobe a little bit brave and 

startedto walk.  But everybody heard the voices.  Andthen we heard English
-
spea
kin g vo i ce s.   
So the group said
 
youknow English, you should talkto them .
 
 
Ok.  I wa s 1 4
 
--
 
no I was 15 already.  So we found 
a  st ick,  
som e underwear
 
--
 
I don't 
know where but we found it.  It was supposedto be white but it wasn't.  And the soldier. I told 

them  who we are, where we com ef rom.  T hey told us never in our life, never seena bunch of  

wom en sodirty, so desperate, soeverything.  W here were you? W hat to do with you? 
 

So they told,ok, we are taking you to ourheadquarter. T he headquarters was in a hotel.
  
T h e y 
were very, ver y nice to us.  They found doctors and nurses. T hey lookedaf ter us. They were 

just looking after us.  It was actually the liberation.  
 
 
And I never, ever could find these soldiers.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And you tried.
 
>> A gi Ge va :  I to l

would love to hear you talk about and I wish we had timefor ouraudience toask som e 
questions. One of the comm ents that you said tom e is that you just can'tbring yourself  to 

describe itas badas itreally was; that, in a way, you're not telling how horrible it really was by 

what you've told us.  Can you say a littlebit about that? 
 
>> Agi Geva:  It's hard for me to talkabout itall.  I made itm y m ission to anybody interested 

andeverybody shouldknow what happenedandhow it happened. But it wouldn't be possible 

for me to continue this m ission if I would tellexactl y how it was.  It was much,much worse.  

W hen Itold you it was the worst, it was the worstf or thatm inute.  But it was much,m uch 

worse.  T he many, many things thatI couldn't even mention, the electric f ences, and a lotof  

things I couldn'tm ention.  I can sleep and I can be calm as long as Idon'thave to talkabout 

the worst stuff, what really, reall y happened. As muchas m y mother, what shedid,taking care 

o f  u s , t h
at we shouldn't know exactly e ver ything
. 
 
I can talkabout what I spoke today thatwa y.  
At least that way ever ybody wil l know and imagine what there was.  But it was much, much 

worse. 
 
>> Bill Benson: W e're going to close theprogram  inam om ent. I wil l
 
turn back to Agi to close 
our program .  Am ong them any things,of  course, that Agi doesn'thave tim e to share with us, 

notonly details andmuch m oref rom what happenedtothis pointbut then what happened 

going f orward
.  
Agi would live for a while under the Comm unists inHungary.  Andm any,m any 

traumas associated with that. And then youand your sister wouldmake it to Israel but your 

m other was not able to.  And that way you told me that was yourf irst real separationf rom  your 

m other.  
 
 
I wish we could keep you all af ternoon. W e can't. But we want to thank youfor 
being with us. W e remind you we'll have a

te r] 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Ialso
 
--
 
it's our tradition at
 
F i rs t  P e rs on
 
that ourf irst person gets the last word.  
So I'm  going to turnback to Agi to close theprogram . W hen she's done, Agi is going to get up 

im mediately and go up the stairs here.  So if  you'll make sure she can do that.  Go to theback
 
door. She's going to sign copies of "Echoes of  Memory"  for anybody who would like one.
 
 
Bef ore Agi does that, she would like to sharewith you, when she's back there, if  you 
want to, as you go by
,  
her tattoo.
  
You can't really see it from the stage here.  Agi will be at the 
door when shef inishes. 
 

 
Again, thank youfor being with us.  Onthat note, letm e turnback to Agi to closeour
