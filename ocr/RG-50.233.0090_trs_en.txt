 I was study in Sa rna and I was living by my aunt, 
that™s my mother ™s sister ™s family and one time we went to the uncle want to come  to us in the 

village to Ko ma rova, and he said we will come  in a place where my grandfather lives. And I 

saw him, that™s one time I saw him, in a villag
e,We  stayed. When I was a child and I thought 
he was an old, old ma n a nd he was sick in this time. We  stayed ma ybe one night and then we 

came to Komarova to my home with my uncle 
from Sarna. That™s what I reme mber my 
grandfather.  My grandmother,
 I don™t reme mber at all.

Q: Did you mother, did she go to school when 
she was younger, do you reme mber?   Did she tell 
you? 
 

A: You know, this time in Poland, we lived, not a lot 
of people got to have an education.  Most of 
the people didn™t get an education.  Most of them
 got 3 grade, 4 grade,
 that was the highest 
because begi n to work and for me , my parents trie
d to give me  more education. They sent me  
to___________ to study.  Most of them a couple of 
grades and that™s  it.  People go to work, 
some  cook,  Many different business. That™s wh
at I think she didn™t ge
t a high education. The 
father got more education than the mother.  
The father, he began to teach me  the Russ ian 
language when the Russians came.  I didn™t know
 too, Russian.  I studied Jewish,Yi ddish, 
Hebrew and Polish. And Russian I didn™t know.

year, I don™t reme mber exactly.  She wa

Q: When you were growing up, what did your father
 do for a living and your mother, what was she 
doing? 
 

A: The father, he was -- we got land, not a lot bu
t a little and we got a cow and we had a horse.  
Most of them the father was working and mother 
in own fi eld.  Then he ma naged a little, what 
is it called?  A ma n, he was living in Barshra and 
he got a lot of forest and field in Koma rova 
and he ma na ged this place, how is it called? 
 

Q: Alandowner? 

 

A: A landowner! And his name  was Shelkovs
ki.  I reme mber his name .  She l kovski. 
 

Q: He was fromWa rsaw?

 Koma rova and see how 
things were going and he left.  He got a lot of 
land.  It was not only in Ko ma rova.  It was in 
Kovakolitch across the river St eir.  He got land 
in one place and in Koma rova.  My father and 
mother got a living from that. 
 

Q: You said your parents sent you away to school in 
Sarna. Wh en did you first go to school there? 
 

A: They sent me to school in Sarna in 1934. And 
I began in first grade and I finished in Sarna in 
eighth grade, that™s 1938.  I came back from Sarna. 
 

Q: When you went to school there, did you stay 
the whole year?   Or di
d you go for the week and 
come  back for the weekends? 
 

A: No, only the winter vacations and summer vacati
ons, I came home. And that™s always I stayed 
because it is not very, very clos
e.  It was from our village to
 Sarna it was 100-110 kilome ters 
and my parents were not rich people to pay to
 come  from Sar na and go back. And it™s not a 
train, we got a train only just to
 Shartansy-Shartrisk and then 
with horses, we went to our 
village and it takes a long time. 
 

Q: Did your sister also go away to school? 

 

A: No, she was studying the village, in Koma rova. 

 

Q: And then you said you came  back to Koma rova in 1938? 

 

A: Ye s. 

 

Q: How ma ny grades did you finish by then? 

 

A: Eight. 
 

Q: You were in the eighth grade? 

 

A: Ye s. That was a school, eight grades. And 
I came  home , ma ybe the parents were not to warn 
me  but the parents were thinking 
to send me  some more to study.  It happened in 1939, it come s 

the war between Poland and Germany.  It star
t and came the Russian and begin the war and 
stopped my education. 
 

Q: So you started working after you came  home? 

 

A: Yes. When I came home from 1938, I was work
ing at home, helped the parents and then when 
it™s 1939, came  the Russ ians.  I begin to work fo
r the Russians. We  got all government jobs.  
We  didn™t have own jobs because the fields, they 
take away everythi ng.  I begin to work and my 
father begin to work. And in a couple of 
years, begin the other war. That™s  1941. 
 

Q: Can you tell me  a little bit a
bout, did the Germans ever come  to Koma rova, in 1939, did they 
ever ma ke it that far? 
 

A: Ye s  In approxima tely 10 days, you mean in 1939? 

 

Q: Ye s, in 1939.  Did they ever reach Koma rova? 

 

A: No, in 1939 it come s not the Germans.  Our place, take Russia in 1939. 

 

Q: So you were in the eastern part of Poland? 
 
A: Ye s, and that™s  decide after the book.  
You know, the border -- the Germans stopped on the 
border on book and the Russians came and take our pl
ace and then we begin to live in Russia in 
1939. And we live until 1941 until be gin the war be
tween Russia and Germany. That was the 
war between Poland and Germany.  
 

Q: That was in 1939? 

 

A: 1939. And it™s our pl ace, take Russia and it
™s become  Russia in 1939 and didn™t leave until 
1941. Again the war. 
 

Q: In the days after September 1
st
, 1939, when the Germans invaded 
Poland, what did your parents 
do, what were they thinking?  We re they frighten
ed of the Germans?  We re they apprehensive 
about what was going on?   How did they 
feel at that time, do you reme mber? ` 
 

A: Do you know, what I reme mber what my father 
explained to me , we hear Germany ki lled a lot 
of people and people run away from Germany, so
me ti me s the father, the father was talking, he 
was saying ﬁI can™t  believe what can happenﬂ.  
He was a war prisoner in a time in German and 
he was saying how the Germans was very good to
 Jewish people. There were prisoners and 
they were good.  He say he cannot be lieve  Hitler can
 change the situation.  Because, in this time  

I think Wilhelm  was the president of Germany 
and this become when Hitler came to the power 

and he changed.  I reme mber when the war withRussia he told me  he say I cannot believe he 

will kill us for what. The people we live in vill
age, we Jewish people we live good with all the 

people because in the village was not a lot of Jewish people.  Maybe 5 families, not more, and 
we didn™t know the diffe r ence between us and 
the Ukraine people.  Everything was together, 
most Ukraine people. And we didn™t know. Th
e Germans came and maki
ng all the bad start. 
 

Q: Did your parents think about tryi ng to get away or
 move to the east, I guess because your father 
wasn™t  that frightened? 
 

A: Ye s, we was talking, in this time, I didn™t have
 a nice life experience in 
this time and the father 
say, ‚no, why we™ll go, where we™ll go, who knows how
 we need to leave the home, we need to 
leave everything, where we will live and it was a 
big mi stake, a big mi stake when the father 
said we will go to Russiaﬂ.A lot of people th
ey escaped from Germany.  I  don™t know how it 
will be when we left; no the father didn™t want to 
leave.  He say we stay in our village.  He say 
the Germans say we will work, we work and we
 will cooperate, for working.  No, it was a big 
difference.  Not only to work. They began to kill us. That begins the trouble. A couple, the 

Germans be gin to come  to us in 10 days. 
 

Q: That was in 1941? 

 

A: 1941.  In ten days the Germans were in our -- I reme mber, I see them the Germans how they 
came like it was, the soldiers, a ko
rot --like a rest place, they came.
 They drink, eat chocolate.  
No fighting. We  feel this time we would have 
trouble.  My father, he speak very well German 

and he was talking with one older, the young 
people was very bad. The older Germans was 
much, much better.   One Ger man, I reme mb er the father explained to me , one German told 

him, you are Jewish, you™ll have a lot of trouble, 
he told him.  It was late. The Germans are 
here, you cannot go anywhere and he  told us, the fa
ther. Yes, a German soldier told hi m we will 
have a lot of trouble and in 10 days after they cam
e, we feel what it was begin to done to us.  
The helpers was the Russian_________ (can™t  understa
nd). The people live
 another nationality 
in the villages and be
gins trouble and trouble. 
 

Q: Can I go back just a little bit to when the Russi
ans came in to the town.  Can you tell me a little 
bit about what happened then?   I mean, how 
they came in, did they seize property and 
businesses and things like that? 
 

A: When Russia came to us, we didn™t got no troubles.
 They came, they begin to work, they didn™t 
say nothing,__________, it was everybody was feeling lik
e the Ukraine people and it was not 
bad. We  begin to work for the governme nt.  I wa
s beginning to work.  I got no more education 

than other people. The Ukraine people they 
want to ma ke me the head of the governme nt 
business. And they want for me to make me
, and I was ma ybe at this time 16, and I  was the 
head of the stores what wa s around the villagesof Koma rova which was 12 or 15 villages and I 

was the head of stores. 
 

Q: You were the Commissar. 

 

A: No, Commis sar is political.  No, I didn™t
 know nothing about politics.  I know only________.  I 
didn™t know how to begin to work. And one Russian guy, he came always from Polkenu, he 

was beginning to ma ke Russian government, we 
lived in Poland and we didn™t know a lot of 
stuff what was going on. And I reme mber he begi
n to teach me.  I told him, ﬁPeople, I don™t 
know from what to begin? ﬂ And he begin to t
each me  how to work and I begin to work and it 
was not bad and the head from the Polke, the high
er grade offi ce there, how it™s called, and he 

tells me  ﬁoh you work very well and goodﬂ and when I came to a meeting, I was the youngest 
person, most of them were 50 and 40 and I came, 17 years, and he was looking to me  what is a 

child come  to us. And I was not this time very 
tall.  I was beginning to work and I was working 
until be gin the war, 1941. And it was a big mi stake why the parents di dn™t  left this place and go 

to Russia. When I take the money from the stor
es, they bring all the mo ney to me  and I put 
them in the bank to Menibish. When it begins
 the war, I got money,
 I got the governme nt™s 
money. Then they come to me at nighttime, 
the Ukrainian people to take the money. When 
overnight left, it was possible to have money, 
it was governme nt™s money. We  didn™t left, we 
stayed.  Maybe in a couple of days, they come to me at nighttime, the Ukraine people and say 

give the money and you have gun.  I didn™t need a gun, I never got a gun. And they begin to do 

a lot, a lot of bad things, it™s 
terrible today if to remi nd us. 
 

Q: You said you worked for the Russians.  Did your parents also work? 

 

A: Ye s. 

 

Q: What did your mother and fa
ther, what were they doing? 
 

A: The mother was working -- when the Russians ca
me  we got a cow, not later we cannot have, but 
in the beginning we got a cow and she ma de food
 and in the house and the father was working.  

He teach young people, the pres
ignico how it™s called, Russian. 
 

Q: He taught Russian to the Polish children? 

 

A: No, no, not Polish children. They speak no Ru
ssian. And the father, he wa s in the Russian 
army and he was an offi cer, I don™t reme mber, from the Czar ™s army, he got crosses. 
 

Q: Like a me dal or some thing? 

 

A: Ye s, me dals. When the Russians came , no one
 t o teach the records and pe ople see what, we 
know hi m and he was a good soldier and he knows Russian language good and he begin to 

teach the governme nt and he take money for this. That was his living and I was working. We  

was not rich.  Not rich, poor. We  didn™t 
got a life like we live
 now inAmerica. 
 

.Q: So your mot her, she didn™t  work outside the 
house.  She worked in the house and that was 
 

A: Ye s, in the house. 

 

Q: You started to tell me  and 
I stopped you.  Can you tell me  a little bit more about the wa r starting 
when the Germans ca me  in 1941?  You said wh
en they came into the 
town, can you tell me  a 
little more about that? 
 

A: When they came in the town I told you, the fi
rst day after 10 days when
 they first came , the 
father told we will go in the forest for a while, maybe the fi rst soldiers will go and then maybe 

later will be better to be not
 in the wrong time in the house. 
 

Q: So he wanted to leave for a little bit,
 let the soldiers leave and then come back? 
 

A: For a little bit. We went to the forest  in Ko
ma rova village in the forest. We  got a horse. Ye s, 

we went to the forest. 
 
Q: The whole family went to the forest? 

 

A: Ye s, the whole family. And we ca me back in 
a couple days. They take out everything from our 
home and we came, the home it was empty.  Ev
erything. We cannot live
 in our home and we 
live in the ho me of my mother ™s sist er in th
e same  village and we stay together with my 
mother ™s sister ™s family and they begin to use 
us in village. The worst work. You can think 
they tell us to do this. We  begin, they send us to
 clean offices, to clean 
toilets. We don™t got 
toilets, everything is outside and 
they keep us to clean. You cannot
 tell, the worst jobs they give 
to us. 
 

Q: To the Jewish people? 

 

A: To the Jewish people, Then in a couple months
, they take us to the ghetto. They take us to 
Kolke ghetto. And the rest of people, we got re
latives in Shatrisk, th
ey took them to other 
ghettos and they was in Shatriska ghetto and our 
fa mily, in Fire ma n™s fa mi ly we was in Kolke 
ghetto and in ghetto, you want
 me  t o explain in ghetto? 
 

Q: We ll, let me  ask you a question and then I™l
l ask you about the ghetto.  How ma ny Jewish 
people were in your town, do you re
member, about approximately? 
 

A: What town do you mean? 

 

Q: InKoma rova. 

 
A: In Koma rova it was 5 families. Approxima tely in
 each family, it was 6 persons in the family.  It 
was 30, 35 people were in the village of Koma rova
.  In Kolke, it was mostly Jewish people.  
Kolke I think was 7,000. 
 
Q: How far away was Kolke fro m Ko marova? 

 

A: That was 12 kilome ters from Koma r ova to Kolke.
 They didn™t give us nothing to take with us 
only what you can get in 
a wagon with one horse. 
 

Q: Whatever you can put on a wagon? 

 

A: Ye s, for all of us. We  go by foot, we walk to 
Kolke. They take everything we got in Koma rova.  
Some  things we take to Kolke. We  take some  clothes. 
 

Q: Do you remember what you took other than cl
othes and things?  Wa s there much to take? 
 

A: No, we didn™t got because they take everything 
from the house and it is only what we got on us 
and that™s  it.  Some  a little food we got, we ta
ke this to the ghetto 
because to the ghetto in 
Kolke, they give in one hour and mu st take 
everything you want in one hour and come to 
ghetto. 
 

Q: Oh, they gave you an hour to collect things. 

 

A: Ye s, to come to ghetto, it was no two blocks in
 the city and if you late 
to come  in the ghetto, 
they will kill you after the time they give one hour to come  in this place.  Everybody was trying 
to come faster in the ghetto. 
 

Q: They gave you an hour from Koma r ova to Kolke? 

 

A: No, from Komarova we got more.  I say it is 
one hour in city Kolke the time to come  to the 
ghetto.  No, when we come  to Kolke  in ghetto, 
one room it was ma ybe ten people in one room.  
It was very, very -- no children but you cannot live 
in a situation like that.  It was very hard. 
 

Q: When did you arrive in Kolk
e?   Do you reme mb er the date? 
 

A: That™s approximately inAugust, I don™t reme
mbe r  the date, when we came in ghetto, when we 
came from Komazaras they gave us yellow patch,one in front and one in back. We  got only 

yellow, yellow patches, one in 
front and if Germans want to 
try how he killed in ghetto, how 
ma ny they killed in, nobody cared about 
this they have the power in ghetto. 
 

Q: So your fa mily, you found a room together? 

 

A: They stayed together.  I reme mber, only, my moth
er and my father they we re crying all the time.  
They looked at me  and my sister, how we will be. A lot of time  they say, we older people, you 

young people you cannot live more, what can happen at every hour. We  went to work, 

someplace.  I work at one place, the father work
ed at anothe r place. They took us to terribl e 
jobs, terrible jobs.  No food. You don™t know if 
you™ll come  back. They take us to job and you 
don™t know if you™ll come back or not. 
 
Q: Do you remember how big the ghetto was? 
 

A: The ghetto was approx 3-4 bl
ocks around, was the ghetto. That was a lot of people because 
they put in one room. They didn™t wa tch bedrooms
. They put in each ro
om ten, eight, twelve 
people in one room, whi c h was a lot of pe
ople.  I think it wa
s 7,000 Jewish people. 
 

Q: Do you remember what your mother was doi
ng?   Did they take 
her to work also? 
 

A: They take her to work.  She was working in 
a, it was a German farm. 
They took her to work 
every day to work in the far m.  Different jobs.  
In the field, to clean, di
fferent jobs.  Every day 
was another job, every day. And nobody paid
 and nobody give food.  Hungry.  In mo st 
situations, the morality was very, very bad.  
You know now you work and in one hour you don™t 
know if he will kill you or he will kill some body in
 the family. And it was every day, thy killed, 
killed. Te rrible, terrib
le situation, terrible. 
 

Q: How did your fa mily get food in the 
ghetto, did the Germans provide any food? 
 

A: Any food. What is left 
from______________ comes from the villag
es, people, for a piece of 
bread we give a suit for a piece of bread. Who 
got the clothes, sold the clothes for food, we 
didn™t got.  Some  people, friendly 
people brought to us a little f
ood. Wh at we got, we changed.  
Then the Germans when we was working, they be
gan to give us 100 grams for a person, bread.  
100 grams, that™s a quarter pound. Two s mall slices
. They begin to give us the bread. And 
that™s  what we lived.  Hungry and no clothes. 
We  were staying in ghetto over wintertime.  

Wi ntertime they take us to hard jobs. That™s to 
woods in forest, in bridges to repair. Any jobs 
they need, they don™t need. They keep us till we 
die. We  were working.  It was very hard that 
time. 
 
Q: Was the ghetto heavily guarded?  Wa s it walled in? 

 

A: No, it was not wall. They got police al
ways, day and time and they were going around 
watching and nobody can come  in ghetto and 
nobody can come  out in ghetto.  People 
smuggling.  People came in and out. Were not a
llowed. And if they catch some body, J e wish 

people they will kill. And if it™
s Ukraine, they will ma ke the m trouble and if he brought some  
food in, they will kill him too. 
 

Q: Did you know people who were 
smuggling things in and out? 
 

A: From the Jewish people? 

 

Q: Oranybody? 

 

A: No, that™s we  live together, we know what 
there smuggling, they went to brought some thing, 
they brought some  food.  Everybody brought for him.
  If he didn™t brought some thing, a lot of 
food, a little, a little, to keep fo
r one day, two days.  Ukraine pe ople, reme mber smuggling from 
our village br inging some  people to us food.  For 
one day a piece of bread or little potatoes or 
some thing more.  No, good.  It was good people a
nd bad people.  Some  people were happy, uh 
huh, Jewish people in ghettos will kill you. 
 

Q: How long did you and your fa mily stay in the ghetto? 
 
A: A year, about a year. 

 

Q: Now, the next summer, did they liquidate
 the ghetto or did they
 take people away? 
 

A: They ma ke t wo pogroms. The first pogrom they ma ke it was approxima tely inAugust they 
ma ke the first pogrom, they take us, me  and my
 father and they took ma ybe 40 people, ma ybe 
50, I don™t reme mber how much and they called us
 one night.They took us in evening and put 
us in warehouse in Lactop. We  didn™t know what
. We were thinking that they would kill us.  
We  stay all the night in the warehouse.   In th
e morning they open up us and take us (they open 

us ma ybe 12:00 daytime) to the ghetto. When we  came to the ghetto we see nobody™s in the 

ghetto, no people. They kill all of the people and th
ey put them in trucks and they take  them out 
from the city. When I and father came to the 
house where we were liv
ing, it was a big building, 
we came in the apartment in the room.  Nobody 
begin to cry.  I can™t  express to you the 
situation.  I will never fo
rget, I came  in the basement. You don™t know what it is.  If you don™t 
talk about it.  If you don™t talk, a person deal
s with life what come s on every day and if you 
begin to remind the time, it is ever forgotten, 
never. There are mome nts for any person, it™s a 
hard time . You can when___________.  I came home  w
ith father, father would begin to cry and 
I would begin to cry and call mother, mother
 and nobody answered.  Now we understand what 
they brought us and they told us 
to take all the stuff what™s  in 
the apartments and in the houses 
and we begin to do this. A lot of people we saw 
what was killed in the apartments and outside.  
And they tell us to take the people they s

                                    (END OF SIDEA,TAPE 1) 

 We  stay ma ybe after that™s enough from the fi

in the forest  it was very hard because the Ukraine 
was killing in the pl aces. They come  back in 
the ghetto and come  aga i n a couple hundred people. 
One day, I with the father, we work in the 
far m and we didn™t go to sleep in the ghetto afte
r that what the guy say what the German take 
from hi m all the gold stuff what he need to wo

One night we stayed with the father in the farm

 we sleep in this pl ace.  I get up and I see the 
father get up and we come.  It was in the barn 
a loft high in the top and we begin to come  out.  

We  seen nobody -- is quiet. We  come only to see down some body. The Germans wi th the 

police, they come  very quiet. They were

around the ghetto, they took us in the ghetto and 
we stay in the house.  How ma ny pe ople they 
can put in one room or two rooms in the buildings, they put us. Then ma ybe by one o™clock or 

two o™clock daytime, comes the first truck to th
e door where they can take people. They ma ke 
like a corridor, they st ay the Ge
rmans, the police with like ---. 
 

Q: Clubs or truncheons?   

 

A: Like the police carry.  Uh-huh. They begin to b
eat us, they take from the house into the corridor 
and we had to run to the truck because the truc
k is open, you need to run.  In house, I told you 
what it was, was there™s a guy what told us he
 was a couple more. They say we have a gun.  
We ™ll go, the young people, we™ll go for m in the truck.  Maybe we can save our life.  He said I 

will begi n to shoot and everybody will help me  or --.  I come  to my father and tell him, you 

know let me , we™ll go together. That™s  when we
 were inside the house, maybe we™ll have a 
chance to run away.  He told me , no, son, I don™t 
want to go.  I don™t want to see your death and 
you will not see mi ne.  I went and a couple people more, we come ourselves to the door. They 

hit us and we  come  on the truck. They put us on 
the truck.  If you sit, you straight up your feet 
straight and on your feet sit anothe
r person.  I got the chance to sit, it was my back -- in the back 
truck in the corner.____________  they put us and we
 see, I see what they said ma ybe five 
policemens inside and a couple Germans in the insi
de in the truck. They take us outside the 
city.  Outside the city the guy wh
at he said he has the gun, he begin -- he take two shot, he 
didn™t work the gun and they killed him straight. When
 they killed him, I was sitting in left side 

and I jumped from the truck on the floor.  I know I hit my face, it was blood and I begin to run, 

run from the  truck. You know what was diff
erence people, it was people what they got a 
sympathy to the Jewish people. They didn™t want to do for them like that.  No, it was a 

difference people too, was a difference with th
is one and they begin to say one Zhid_________. 
That means a Jewish guy, he™s running. The policeman run away, I was jumped to two fences.  

Now when some body tells me  to jump this fence, 
tell me  you can kill me , I will not jump. This 

time it was so, was so to life to be like that.  Hr 
begin to shot after me .  He shot me  two, three 
times.  He didn™t shot me and I come in a bar
n.  It was a pig and I jumped where the pig -- I 
know what some body™s running after me .  I see what
 to do.  In Poland or in Russia, it was a 

small barn. Then you can go up, it stays straw or some thing more_____and I jumped.  It™s only 

when you™re young, when you™re physically fast what
 you can do then. That™s  seconds, seconds 
because when I jumped in the barn and I come , itwas straw.  I come in the corner and I put on 

me, straw.  It takes maybe not more, maybe two 
mi nutes, three mi nutes ma ybe, not more.  I hear 
what it™s  open, the barn is open and the po
liceme n, how ma ny it was, I don™t know. The 

policemen and the German. They said here jumped, a Jewish guy jumped inside. Whe n I hear 

this, I think that™s it. Wh en I jumped from th

cannot do to help them, nothing to do to help 
them.  I was  staying in this bar
