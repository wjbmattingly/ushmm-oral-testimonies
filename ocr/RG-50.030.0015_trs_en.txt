Q: Please tell us your name , where you were born, and when you were born?  

 

A: My name  is Helene Baraf, name d Zupnik. I 
am born in Antwerp, Belgium, the 24th of July 
1927. 
 

Q: Tell us about your family and your childhood before the war. 

 

A: Uh...I will start to tell you a little bit about
 my...uh... ancestors. Uh...I come  from two very 
famous branches... uh...of...uh...the Jewish relig
ion. My great grand uncle was...uh...Rabbi 
Meisels (ph) who has a synagogue name d ... uh...after
 him in Prague and on my father's side 
I have Rabbi Dovelando (ph), who was very
 famous too, who has another synagogue 
name d...uh...after him. Uh...my mother came from 
a very religious family. She had four 
brothers and four sisters.  And...uh...she was th
e only who survived the Holocaust, and they 
all had many, many children because that was th
e way of life in that time. And...uh...she was 

already...uh...an older person when she me t my....m
y father who came from Czechoslovakia 
and she accepted to...to ma rry him after refu
sing ma ny, ma ny suitors. And...uh...they lived in 

Krakow for one year...uh...where my brother 
was born in 1924, in July 26, 1924. And after 
the...they stayed  uncast. That means that....uh...her brother was...uh... keeping them for a 
year where my father...when my father was studying. And then after the time was gone, they 

came to Belgium where I was born the 24th of
 July 1927. Uh...I grew up there, and we 
lived...uh...nicely. My father and my mother...i
n the beginning were working in the 
diamonds business. She was a Schleifer which 
means she was, I don't know how to say that 
in English...she...they were...he...she was not a cu
tter. A Schleifer is what a polisher...a 
diamond polisher and...uh...little by little my father 
became...uh...courtier. Is that an English 
word?   Courtier?    Uh...He was selling fo
r other diamonds and...uh...uh...life became easier 
and...uh...I was going as a child in...uh...in the...and my
 first language was French so I went 
to grammar school in Belgium and on Wednesd
ay afternoon and Sunday morning I went to 

Jewish school. My brother went to a Jewish 
school for...uh...the whole day where he learned 
Hebrew and Jewish and...uh...French 
and Flemish. Uh...in...in 1940 when I 
finished...uh...no...let's go back to 1937...uh...when I cam
e to American. To tell you the story 
why we came to America is because...uh...by great grandfather died here in America in 

1936. They came, I think, after the First Worl
d War here with all the children but my 
grandmother was already married in...uh...in C
zechoslovakia so she was...uh...I think she 
was the oldest daughter. So she remained 
with her husband and her children there in 
Czechoslovakia. This is why I have...uh...in reality
 I am a third generation already American 
because... uh...my family is here. So my father came here to America to...for the question of 

the inheritance. And he liked it so much because
 he found all the family here that he didn't 
know. His cousins, his uncles...uh...it was...uh...very happy situation for him. So he wanted 

to immi grate. And we immi grated really to Am
erica in September of 37. For me as a child it 
was a shock because it was in the depressi
on era and...uh...we lived in the low east side.

We ...compared to what...how we lived in New Yo
rk or...in Antwerp, was a big difference. It 
was a mi sery compared to that. And...uh...although I...I
 loved to be with all these cousins that 
I didn't know but...uh...unfortunately they send me
 to school...uh...as a....with the beginners. I 
was already 10 at the time and it was very hard
 for me because I didn't spoke the language. 
My brother, who was three years older, and 
finished already grammar school, immediately 
entered to high school and instead to be in th
e sixth...I don't know...in the first year, they sent 
him immediately in the third grade. I don't know 
to compare that with the American. So he 
was very happy. I was very unhappy here, and I 
cried a lot and...uh...it...because it was a very 
difficult time at that time with the depression 
and my...my mother and father had a lot of 
difficulties ma king out. So we came to the c
onclusion that...uh...maybe it would be easier for 
my father if we send...we went back...uh...to An
twerp and...uh...this is what they decided to 

do. We  went...me and my brother and my mother, 
we went back to Antwerp and my father 
stayed here in America. My mother wa
s from...uh...the...from Galicia, and she spoke a 
beautiful Polish and beautiful German and sh
e was great admi r... admi rer of...uh...of German 
poetry from Heine and...uh...and she sang German 
Lieders to me, so I...I never studied 
German, but I do speak and I do understand it. And...uh... she never believed that...uh.... 

German with their culture could do anything to
 the Jews she said. Although we saw all the 
people comi ng from Germany in 1939, she said...but...
it's not so terrible. My father was very 
scared because he heard all the rumors and he came to bring us back to America in 

September of 39. And my mother refused to go 
back to America. She said, "Not back and 
forth. You come  back to...to Europe."  My father
 said, "No," so he stayed in America. So 
unfortunately because of this...uh...dispute between
 them we stayed in Belgium. Uh...The 
German invaded Belgium in the beginning 
of May. I think...uh...around the 10th of May...I 
cannot know exactly...uh...and 10 days later we...my 
mother decided we cannot stay.  Uh...It 
was the war. So we took some  of our possessions
 and we took the train direction of France. 
The train was stopped at the...uh...I don't know how you say that. At the frontier?  
 

Q: At the border?  

 

A: At the border. And...uh...we couldn't take...uh...a
lthough we had little...few suitcases and we 
started to go across the border and walk in...b
ecause we didn't know where we wanted to go, 
but as far as possible. And we started to 
walk through Moucron. I remember the border was 
Moucron, and we walked with the suitcases a
nd with a lot of other people who were stopped 
there too who...and we went to Amiens, to
 Cambrai and...uh...it took us about two weeks 

under the bombing...the uh...the German with...uh... Ho
w do you say that their...their planes 
they were...uh...shooting at us and we were...had 
to run in the...uh...in the ditches for...for 
protection and a lot of people were
 killed in front of us.  But...uh...finally we arrived in Lille 
where they put us in a school. No, it was more a college, a college where they had dormitory 

and where we slept and we stayed there for a month. And...uh...then the German occupied all 

France, so we had to go to...towards...uh... norma l life. So we...my mother rented an 

apartment in Lille. I remember it was rue 
Solferino 142. It's  funny how my me mory can 
remember certain things and      others. Ru
e Solferino 142, and not far from there, I had my 
high school. And my husband went to hi
s high school. And...uh...my mother had a little

money so for a time things were alright
. We  lived...uh...and...uh...and days went by and the 
years went by because it was from May 40 til
...I cannot say exactly when the Germans 
started to do all the mi series. I think it was from...uh...the beginning of 42. Uh...they asked us 

to register as Jew. We were forced to
 wear the...the Jewish...uh...star and...uh...we obeyed 
what we were...uh...uh...we're supposed to do 
and...uh...life went on. Unfortunately, my...my 
brother had a birthday in July 42 and fo
r his birthday my mother bought...brought... bought 

him...uh...a trench coat. And...uh...this trench 
coat, unfortunately, cost him his life 
because...uh....the Jews were forced to...couldn't go 
where they wanted in a cafe. There was 
one cafe where the Jews could go and wh
ere they gathered. And...uh...my...uh....my brother 
was a very quiet boy and very shy a
nd very straightforward, very honest...uh...no 
haughtiness. Uh...he played there...him with his 
friend, he played chess there. And one day 
when he was playing there...uh...the guy of 
the Gestapo came and asked...uh...to whom does 

belong that trenchcoat. And my father...my 
brother stupidly answered, "It's mi ne." 
And...uh...there was no Jewish...uh...cross...uh...Star of Da
vid on it, so they took him to jail. 
My mother immediately went to the Gesta
po. She saw the guy of the Gestapo, and begged 
him to release him and say...telling him it was hi
s birthday. It's a mi stake. He had it on his 

suit, the Star of David, but not on the co
at so. But nothing doing. They...they wouldn't 
release him. Uh...he stayed in jail 
in Loos. It's a section of Lille, and from there they sent him 
to...through Belgium, to Auschwitz. There were a 
few of them that were taken at the same 
day. And I know well that he was in Auschw
itz because one of the guys who was taken 
together with him came back, and he told me that he was well liked with the German...they 

liked him because he...he has such a serious...uh...he 
was a serious nature, so he did whatever 
he had to do. And he was alive til July 1944 
because...uh...he saw him at that time and then 
he...they were separated, and he doesn't  know wh
at happened to him. He was in Auschwitz-
Birkenau, and he gave me  his number, but 
I cannot remember it. He...uh...I know that for a 
fact that he was waiting because he was born in Poland, but he was very little...a baby when 

he came to Belgium so he didn't know the 
family. So he was waiting... uh...all the family 
there, and he introduced himself to the fam
ily so he...he learned to know his family...and 
between them was a cousin who...who...to whom
 he told that he came from Lille 
and...uh...and that we...me and my mother, we were 
there. So after the war, this cousin by 
accident me t...uh...a girl from Antwerp a
nd...uh...uh...he hims elf was the son of a very 
extremely rich ma n who had buildings and...a
nd...uh...uh...petroleum           pit.... I don't 
know how you call that...uh...so he sold someth
ing and...uh...because he...he couldn't take the 
money so he bought some  gold and put it in hi
s shoe and because he didn't want to go 
directly to Antwerp, he came through France and was looking a way to go through 

the...uh...frontier. And when he passed Lille, he 
remembered...he remembered that he had an 
aunt there, so he went to the Jewish commun
ity and asked if there was a Mrs. Zupnik here. 
And he found us. And he told us that he saw 
my brother there in the concentration, but he 

lost him also in 44, and he doesn't  know what 
happened to him. Uh...and he went to live in 
Antwerp.  
 

Q: Tell us what happened to you and your mother after your brother was taken.

A: Yes. Because...uh...my mother went to the Ge
rman Gestapo, she was scared to do anything 
because she thought if she would escape...she 
would run away, there would be retaliation 
against him. So we stayed. We  continued fo
r one month our life and on the evening of Yom 
Kippur in...uh....in very early in the morning, tw
o me n of the Gestapo came  into our house 
and...uh...took us.  My mother put some  stuff, so
me  money away, and gave it to the...the 
lady...uh...where we lived to put it way in
 case...uh... uh...we escaped...uh...we wouldn't be 
without anything. So, but the st
ory that happened is really like a mi racle. We went to 

the...uh...railroad. The German took us to 
the railroad where there were about 3,000 
families...Jewish family were there and...uh...from the early morning. It was a very hot day. 

We  stayed...uh...there at the railroad waiting what the German would do with us. And I saw a 

lot of people because it was the eve of the ho
lidays, they went to their homes and brought 
back chicken and food and it was like an entert
ainment party, and suddenly I see my mother 
and she said, "Come. Come. We have to go so
me where."  And she says...and I said, "No, I...I 
have my friends here. I want to stay here."  
Said, "Come. Come . Come . You have to come ." 
So I followed my mother and we were take
n to a room...uh...a very tiny room. We  were 
about 13 persons there. And the door they 
put wood on the door so the Germans wouldn't 
know that room existed. After awhile, we
 heard...uh...the train...uh...leaving and the whole 
place was very quiet because...uh...3,000 people do a lo
t of noise. And we stayed there and it 
was a very scary night because we had a few
...a few me n who were ve
ry nervous. There was 
a window and we heard the Gestapo walking back and forth. And...uh...I was...uh, I was 

already 14 at the time. 
 

Q: Who...who came to your mother?    

 

A: A ma n...a ma n of the underground. And he asked 
her, "Do you want to be saved? "  And my 
mother said, "Yes."  And as a matter of fact 
I asked my mother later, "How come that you 
decide to...to be saved because you were 
scared...uh...that some thing would happen." 
Well...then she answered me, "I realized at th
at time there was nothing any more to be lost 
because they were taking us so I wanted to
 save you and myself."  And so we were...uh...put 
in that room and me n are me n...very selfish...s
ome people start to...want to smoke cigarettes 
and they put the lights and the matches a
nd we were scared...uh...terribly because...uh...they 
could see the lights. So we stayed...uh...in..uh...all 
night there. I think around 1 o'clock men 
came through the window. They put a ladder at 
the window and they took us out. And since 
that time we were taken over by the underg
round. They took us...which is...uh..very curious 
story. And it is an explanation. They took us
 to a whore house because this where people 
who were...the whores. I didn't know, but they ha
ve very big hearts. They (pause)...they are 

known for that...that...that they will do lot of thi
ngs for...to save people. And we stayed in a 
whore house for a few days, and we saw th
e underground comi ng back with guns and all 
things and it was a very scary story. And then
 they came back with ...uh...false identification 
for me and my mother and for the other peoples
 and we were separated. And I, as a girl, 
young girl, I could go to a convent. My mother c
ould not, unfortunate, for her. So she had to 
go on her own and...uh...it was very painful. She told me that many times she slept in the 

streets. She had no where to go. She was in th
e hiding and for her, the situation was worse 

 
5
USHMM Archives RG-50.030*15 5
 
 
because she went to the Gestapo and th
ey knew her face. And she had the false 
identification. Uh...they gave me  the na
me ...I kept my...uh...my...uh...real date of birth 
because I was scared to...uh...to be mi xed up, 
and I became Helene Delcombre. And...uh...I 
went to the convent and...uh...they were very
 nice to us and I...uh...my mother was...uh... 
worried because I was going to high school and 
for her the studies was a very important 
thing so she ma de me ...uh... subscribe at a school where you could send..uh... 
correspondence school. But it wasn't  working. 
And I stayed there from...from September 
til...I think a little bit after the Easter holid
ays. Then from...and...uh...I heard a lot of times 
that the German were comi ng in...uh...the convent
 looking for Jewish children. There I met a 
lot of other Jewish children and I met a girl 
that I knew and I know a lot of babies were 
taken. A lot of people of saved that we don't know about it but...uh...uh....one person were 

telling the other. Just by ear we found 
out that...uh...that the French people were 
extraordinary. And...uh...to them when they...whe
n the people say that they were anti-
Semites, they didn't even know what 
it was to be Jewish. They thought we 
were....uh...like...uh...des Auvergnats.
1
 They were cheap with the m
oney. It's a part of section 
of France where people are very...I don't know
 the right expression...one penny is a penny. 
They don't want to spend it. So they thought Jews
 are like these people. So to say that they 
were anti-Semite, it's the wrong thing because they didn't even know that...uh...what exactly 

is a Jew and physically the Jews looked like I 
and my mother who come s from an extremely 
religious fam...family. She looks like a Polish 
girl, like a Polish peasant with...uh...the cheeks 
and the nose. Uh...it's amazing. 
 

Q: What was life like daily in the convent?  

 

A: In the convent?   I was supposed to have
 the normal life from the children. I was not 
supposed...I didn't tell no one that...uh...only one 
girl that I knew from the outside. I 
recognized her. The other children didn't know that
 I had to conform to 
the rules. I had to go 
everyday to Mass with the...I...I was doing  except I didn't take...uh...I don't know...the...uh...I 

didn't take the whole          because I di
dn't go to confession. But except of this, I was doing 
exactly like the...uh...the other girls because
....uh...I didn't want to attract attention...uh...to 
whom I was. I was normal to do exactly like the other children. 
 

Q: And what did you do during the day?    

 

A: Well, early morning we went to Ma
ss. Uh...They were children that...uh...uh...uh...our Lady 
of the Good Shepherd...that was the convent that I went...and there were children 

that...uh...had thing...they were children how...I don't 
know how to say that. That did things 

that were not right. They were...or vagrant or 
children that did things that were not...uh...right 
for children to do. The rebellious children...uh...were...but they were very young. 

Some ...uh...some were from...uh...the ag
e of six til...uh... til...uh...16 because...uh...16 you 
are...in France you could work. So....

Q: How did you get along with the other children?  

 

A: Very well because...uh...why not?   (Chuckle)  I am 
a French girl like every French girl and I 
don't look Jewish at all. Nobody coul
d...uh...guess...uh...anything and I...and I was smart 
enough...uh...not to talk about this things. U
h...I went to Mass. I ate. I...uh...I...uh...we 
had...uh... religious... uh...blessings...uh...I did 
whatever the other children...we 
did...uh...some work...uh...some hand knitting, some ...uh... 
embroideries. Whatever the other 
children did, I did. And...uh...a little bit I did some school by correspondence, but it wasn't  

good. So my mother decided that I had to go b
ack to high school. So then we were taken 

over by the Protestant community. Uh...I remember the name was Mr. Pausch, and this was 
in...I was staying in Lille, and this was in 
Roubaix which was... uh...there were three cities 
around Lille, Roubaix, Tourcoing, which were 
about...uh...half an hour distant one of the 
other. 
 

Q: Did you see your mother often?   How did 
you get from the convent to the Protestant 
community. 
 

A: I never went out from the convent...uh...unless 
I had an operation from the amigdales. How 
do you say that?   How do you say that. I had to have the...uh... 
 

Q: Tonsils?  

 

A: The tonsils removed. That's the only time I we
nt out. My mother came to see me and brought 
me  food. I don't know how she did it, but...uh...she
 still found the time to and the money to 
give me ...uh...because it was...uh...very very 
hard time. We were eating bread 
with...uh...sawdust in the bread. It was...uh...very 
bad bread. The food was terrible. It was 
war, and ma ny times we had...uh...we heard English plane comi ng and bombing. It was war. 

It wasn't ... uh..easy time for no one and... So she decided I should go to school. So she...I 

don't know how she found out the Protestant co
mmunity, and they gave us some  lodging 
some where outside of Roubaix and I was enro
lled in the Roubaix High School. It was very 
difficult thing because in that school I met a gi
rl that I was in school in Lille and she knew 
my real name . And suddenly from Helene Z
upnik, I became Helene Delcombre. And I didn't 
know how to do it. I was young. I was 15 years old and I was very childish at the time. But 

then I had an idea. I knew she was...uh...a scout. 
So I took her on the side, and I told her, 
"You know I want to tell you a story, but you have to tell...to swear me on your scout's honor 

that you will not tell nobody...uh ...what's the true stor
y. I am a Jewish girl, and I have false 
identification paper and nobody's supposed to know
 it."  She said, "Don't worry. I will not 
tell anyone."  And the irony is that
 I didn't know that at the time, but that girl herself was half 
Jewish. And so...uh... uh...I stayed in that sc
hool...uh...til the end of the war. But I didn't 
stay...you see the thing is that every day lif
e to be in...uh...people get tired to be...uh...helpful 
to others. You know it's not easy to take th
e...uh...uh...the mother and the daughter. They live 
and after awhile, the cohabitation with that pe
rson was difficult so we had to move and my

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*15 7
 
 
mother found a place in Tourcoing. She found a lo
t...a very mi serable place, but we didn't 
have where to go so we were happy to go 
there. And I continued to go to Roubaix. 
And...uh...I spoke to that girl because...uh... sh
e...she...she was the only knew...one who 
knew her...my identify and I told her, "You know, 
we are living in Tourcoing in a mi serable 
place and with the bombing all the time and the col
d. We  didn't have what to heat."  So she 
came her...her parents were very rich, extremely rich. Uh...uh...Her father was a kind 
of...uh...nobility and she said...she spoke to her 
parents and she said, "You know what?   I 
have an idea. I will take you in my...uh...we ha
ve the gardener's house there. And she 
presented me to her mother and her father w
ho were very nice and sh
e took me out...in their 
house where we stayed til the liberation. And they 
never told us what they really were. After 
the war in December of 44, I had the surprise 
of a cousin who came and found me  there. His 
name  was Jerry Balomi ch from...uh...he lives in
 (pause)...at the time he lived in Brooklyn. 
And he found me . By mi racle. How he found me , 
he first looked at the first high school, and 
he me t some body that I me t a few days before who I told I was going to the LycÃ©e of 

Roubaix and it's unbelievable, but he found me . 
Then...uh...he could report to my father that 
we were alive.  
 

Q: Had you had no contact with your father at this point?  

 

A: I received...uh...a letter of the Red Cross in...in 
1941 from my father. That's the only contact I 
had. So he knew we were alive in 41, but afterwards he didn't know. 
 

Q: What happened after the liberation?  

 

A: ...happy time and we were waiting that...uh...my br
other would come  back and my father 
was writing. He said we should come  to America.
 And my mother said, "Yes, but I have to 

wait first that my...uh...son come s back."  A
nd we went to Paris to the different 

organization...organization to find out if...if he 
was still alive and he was comi ng back, but 
we never...uh...we never got any news about
 him and we never knew except by...by these 
two witness who came back who 
told me  that they...he was in Auschwitz-Birkenau, where 
he was alive til July 44. Then I have no...no other news and...uh...he never came back. 
 

Q: You said your husband was in high school with you. 

 

A: My husband. No. My husband came from Ruma nia. How could he come  here?  

 

Q: No. That's what I wondered. 

 

A: No, no, no. No, no, no. Uh...no no. 

 

Q: Okay. 

 

A: Do you want to know more about my life afterwards?

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*15 8
 
 
 
Q: Yes. Tell me about the...the early years after the war. 

 

A: After the war I continued to go to high 
school. And...uh... my father was much younger than 
my mother. And he was a very religious Jew 
and...uh...because he lost his son he wanted to 
have another son. So it was very important fo
r him so and because she couldn't bear any 
children, he divorced my mother and...uh...I re
ma ined...uh...in France and he rema ined in...in 
America. And it was a terrible shock to me. I we
nt into a deep depression because of that 

and...uh...I couldn't study anymore. And...uh...I got 
married very early. In 19...in December 
1948 and I had a daughter and in 51...uh...when my 
father died, I couldn't stand my husband 
anymore. And I divorced him. And in 56, I me t my second husband who came  from Israel 

and...uh...we moved to Paris and we start a ne
w life. Unfortunately, in ...uh...June 18, 1959, a 

car struck my daughter and she died th
e same  day. And life goes on. And...uh...my husband 
always dreamed of America. Uh...As soon as he became French in...uh...in 66, the first thing 

he did, he came to visit America. He had...he...he 
also was a third generation of America. His 
grandfather came here from Rumania to...to Israel
 where he wasn't  successful and then he 
came to America and Canada because it was diffi
cult at that time to come to America from 
Canada. They went to Philadelphia. And...uh...he 
loved America too when he came to visit 
in 66. And...uh...in 69 we came. In June, as a ma tte
r of fact, the same  day as my daughter 
died. June 18, 1969 we came to America, and 
we became American citizens. My husband 
died in...uh...May 29, 1980, and...uh...I rema ined alone. 
 

Q: Have you...uh...made contact with your family. 

 

A: Oh sure. Oh sure. I was...uh...accept[ed] with open arms. I'm  the...prodigal...prodigal 
child...uh...because...uh...coming back to the...they knew me  as a child.  
 

Q: Do you have family here?  

 

A: Unfortunately, most of them died now and...uh...now I am alone...uh...and it's very hard. 

 

Q: All right. Thank you. Wa s it so hard as you thought?  

 

A: When you start you...it goes, it flows. (laughter) 

 It is...uh...something very funny that...uh...it's trag
ic comedy at the same time. Uh...the lady 
who accepted her... us to stay in her gardener's house was very nice to us and said goodbye 

to us when we moved away and we lived in another section of Lille. And...uh...over the years 

we lost contact with her. But when I got ma
rried, my mother got very ill, and she couldn't 
stay by herself and in Paris we lived in a ve
ry small apartment and we couldn't...uh...keep her 
with us. So she went to the Rothschild Ins
titution and she was accepted there. There she met 
a gentleman that she liked very much because 
he was a German Jew and she spoke a perfect 
German, so she found her alter ego. And...uh...it was a little love affair. He was (laughter) 

already 84 and she was in her...in her early 
60s, so she was a beauty for him. And...uh...it

was by an irony...by a twist of fate, this gentlema
n was the uncle of the mother of my friend 
in school. So then I found out...uh...10 years later 
that the mother who received me in her 
house herself was a Jewish lady.  
 
Q: And that was the first you knew that?  

 

A: That's the first time I found out. They never told me. Montaigne was the name of her 
husband. I can't  remember the name of the 
gentlema n who was very good to my mother 
because...uh...she had Parkinson Disease. 
And...uh...she broke her ankle, and she 
was...uh...taken to the hospital and he sustained her very much. But the irony is that he was 

the uncle of the lady who saved her...us in her garden.  
 

Q: Do you have any other me mories of the war years?  

 

A: Like what?   What kind of me mories?   Wh
at we did through...during the war or...it was war 
time. Uh...but life goes on. Uh...I am a 
young...uh...girl...uh... I went to school. I...uh...I...I 
lived a normal life, but with false identification papers.  
 

Q: What was...what were the nuns like in the convent?  

 

A: Very nice. They...uh...they behaved with 
me ...they knew who I was, but...uh...they behaved 
very nicely. They saved my life. 
 

Q: Were there a lot of Jewish children? 

 

A: Yes. A lot. But...uh...there were so 
ma ny different places...uh...but I suppose from...uh...most 
of the Jewish community was wiped out...uh... 
 

Q: Did...did you ever see the nuns again?  

 

A: After the war, I went to...to find them. Yes. I went to see all these people who thanked me 
naturally, but...uh... LIfe goes on...uh...and you are taken by ma ny occupations and 

preoccupation and...uh...you forget and...uh...I thought that it was important to tell these 

things because many people say it never happened so
 before I die I want to bear witness to 
these things because I...I suffered them
 and...uh...unfortunately I lost so ma ny people 
because of it, and people say it never happened. 
 

Q: And that's important for us. Thank you. 

 

A: You'rewelcome.
