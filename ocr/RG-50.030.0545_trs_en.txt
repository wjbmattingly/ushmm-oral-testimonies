Question: This is the 
United States 
Holocaust Memorial Mu
seum interview with 
Ellen Zw eig
, conducted by 
Judith  Cohen
 on March second in 
Leisure World
 in 
Silver Sprin g
. Let™s start by telling me your 
name at birth, as it was in 
Germany
, 
the names of your parents. 
Answer: Okay. The 
Œ my  name was 
Ellen Seligman
, it™s spelled with one 
n, s-e-l-i-
g-m-a-n.
 My mother™s name was 
Rose Hirschfeld
 was her maiden name, and my 
father was 
Julius Seligman. 
Q: And did you have any siblings? 

A: I had one sister, younger than  me. Her name was 
Margit.
 
Q: And where were you born, 
an d your date of birth. 
A: I was born in 
Regensburg , Germany
, which is right on th e 
Da nube, 
in May 
18
th
, 1929. 
Q: And how long had yo
ur family lived in
 Regensburg
? 
A: My mother™s family go 
back  to the 1800s, I believe. 
I know like 1890 or earlier. 
My father™s family I th ink came to 
Reg ensburg
 wh en he was a young boy. They 
came from a town called 
La mbsheim
, which is near the 
Rhine
. And they opened 
the store there in germ Œ in 
Regensburg
. 
Q: Tell me something about the first 
couple years of your life, you rememb er, 
before the Nazi takeover. We™ll start with 
what sort of store your father owned Œ

A: Mm-hm. 
Q: Œ and what sort of cultural activities, religious activities
 
that your parents were 
involved with. 
A: Okay , yeah 
[indecipherable]
 yeah. Well, they were pre
tty assimilated. M y  Œ my 
maternal grandparents had a department store called 
Teats, 
which was sort of a 
chain store. They  Œ they  had combined 
buying powers, I believe, and it was a very 
nice store, I reme mb er that, it had several 
floors. And after my  parents got married 
in 1928, my father opened another store 
in the suburb. And th
ey were well off, I 
have to say, I mean, I would say middle 
upper class, you know. And we had a good 
life, that™s all I can say. 
Q: What was your hou Œ wh at 
did your house look like? 
A: Well, we Œ we had a flat, we di Œ neve
r lived in a house. Ev
en my grandparents 
did not have a house. It was 
a big flat. My father had a car. We had a ri Œ th-the Œ 
the house we lived in had th
ree stories I Œ I rememb er, and it had a big garden . And 
it was a Œ a very nice place. And you know, we
 Œ we went on trips, wa Œ like I said, 
my father had a car, we could go in the 
summertime. This was before 1935, I would 
say. We would go sk iing in 
the winter, we g Œ we wo
uld go sw-swimming. Mostly 
in the rivers, but they had special places
 where you could go swimming. My parents

belonged to a tennis club Œ befo
re all this happened, you 
know, when th
ey were still 
able to do that. S Œ s Œ  
Q: And Œ 
A: Œ and it Œ so wh en I Œ or wh en I entered 
school in 1936, I guess,
 I had to go to a 
Jewish school, I could not go to a public school. 
Q: Okay. Let™s go back a little bit. What was 
your parents™ social circle like before 
the Nazis? Did they have German fri
ends in addition to Jewish friends? 
A: I™m su Œ I™m sure th ey did, because wh
en  they played  tennis,
 you know, at this 
particular place, it was like 
a little country club, I guess, 
and I™m sure they did. I 
was too young to rememb er all that. The 
only thing I can tell you, my  mo ther™s 
sister,  who was younger than she was 
by th ree years, me t her husband th rough 
tennis, and he was not Jewish. And even
 though my  grandparents weren™t happy, 
she married  him in 1934, I think. 

Q: Oh, after the Nazis had taken over. 
A: Yes, yes, uh-huh, yeah. And he was a ve
ry nice man, he was a lovely per Œ man 
and he was from a good family, they were Ca
tholic. And he helped  my  grandparents 
in a way, because they moved in with my
 grandparents, and in a way, because of 
him, you know, things didn™t Œ weren't bad for them.  
Q: Did he face any, you know, problems Œ

A: Yes, he did. 
Q: Œ from 
rossenshonda
(ph) and Œ 
A: Yeah, yeah, well, he did. Well, this Œ 
Q: 
[indecipherable]
 
A: Œ this happened after we 
left, my parents and I left 
Germany
. They eventually 
took him to camp, or to a Œ a wo rkplace, 
because he wouldn™t divorce her. And my  
aunt at that time had two little boys. I Œ my Œ my older cousin  I remember. One was 

maybe five, and the other one had Œ was born
 after we left. She 
moved in with her 
in-laws, they took her in 
with the two children. And 
she Œ they were living in 
Munich
, and th en she went back  to
 Regensburg 
where her in-laws were living, 
after everybody had left, 1941, I guess, ™
40 - ™41. And because my  family was so 
well known in 
Regensburg
, and dote Œ we had a lo
t of farming communities 
around th ere, they brought her food. 
Q: And let me ask you a little bit more ab
out this German uncle. What was his 
name? 

A: 
Fritz Brem, b-r-e-m.
 
Q: And did he surviv e the war? 
A: Yes, he did. They
 all survived the war.

Q: Did his family support him after the marr
iage to your aunt, or was he disowned, 
or Œ 
A: Well, he Œ he had Œ he ha
d a profession. He was a director of a Œ a mine that Œ I 
Œ I™m not quite sure, 
kalkswag
(ph) it was called. And he was a director of it before, 

and after the war the Americans put him back
 in a director. So, 
you know. Although 
he did e-encounter still anti-
Semitism, even after the war. 
Q: Let™s move back to yo
ur own immediate family. 
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: You were still fairly  young, but what
™s your first memory
 of life under the 
Nazis? 
A: Well, you know, like I said, I was rather young. I Œ I just do rememb er though, 
my  father had a Catholic secretary. And sinc
e my  parents couldn™t take us to things 
like movies, you know, and Œ she would ta
ke Œ take me. And the sti Œ I faintly 
reme mb er that she once took me to a prog
ram, you know, in Decemb er, before the 
Christmas, they have this Saint
 Nicholas
 in 
Germa ny
, and it was very Catholic 
party, and where, you know
, they c Œ would come around and Œ an d ask all the 
children, you know, have you 
been good, and so forth. 
And later, I understand Œ I 
was told this story, that somebody came
 up to this woman who had Œ who was not

married, and said, who is that nice little gi
rl w ith you Œ that nice little Aryan girl 
with you? And it was me, because I had blo
nde hair and blue eyes. So, you know Œ 
Q: Any idea what she responded? 
A: I don™t know. I don™t know whether sh
e di Œ she said her niece probably , you 
know, something like that, so, you know. 
But she was a Œ a wonderful person and 
even after the war she kept in touch with
 my family. Her fa Œ her brother was a 
priest and she eventu ally went to work  fo
 Œ with him, or was his housek eeper. So Œ 
and after the war, we Œ my parents got together with her again. In fact, she came 
over here once with her br
other on a pilgrima ge. 

Q: And do you have a
ny other memo ries of your chil
dhood under the Nazis before 
you emigrated? 

A: Well, I think my family kind of shield
ed me from this. I do 
reme mb er th at t h e Œ  
the Jewish community in
 Regensburg
 found a place Œ it wasn™t a ga Œ actually a g Œ 
a sports place where we could all go and cong
regate on the weekend, or on Sunday. 
And you know, th-the Œ we could play an
d you know, i-it wa Œ it wasn™t exactly a 

country club, but it was a place where the Je
wish families coul
d go and have an 
outing, and things like that. I remember th
at. It was far out into the suburbs. But, 
you know, it gave us a place 
to go when we weren™t allo
wed to Œ to commingle with 
the other population. So, you know, and we 
would play sports th
ere, and so forth,

you know. So Œ but that Œ 
other than that, I mean I Œ I never really Œ until 
Kristallnacht. 
That Œ that Œ then Œ then of cour
se, things cha Œ really changed.  
Q: Yeah. Tell me  your memo ries of 
Kristallnacht. 
 
A: Well, I do remember that there was a kno
ck on our ap-apartment at six in the 
morning. But of course my sister and I were
 in  our Œ were in our bed, and we didn™t 
get out of bed. But there was a knock on ou
r door, and they came to get my father. I 
mean, that™s all I know. I mean, you know, at
 that Œ that time. And we Œ I really 
wasn™t privy to anything, and my  mo ther
 probably  spoke with my  grandmother. 
And even tually we moved, we went to 
my  grandmother™s house and stayed with 
them Œ 
Q: And why did Œ 
A: Œ wh ile he was Œ actually my  father
 was not taken to concen tration camp, 

because he had had a broken 
leg the summer before. So he
 took his two canes with 
him, and because of that they kept him in 
the town jail with all 
the older people, for 
a week. And after that they Œ my grandm
other was very active in the community 
and she got him out. Also her Œ my  gra
ndfather, and their son, were sent to 
Dach au
. 
But my grandmother, as I said, was very 
active in the community, and sh e actually 
wa Œ this I Œ this I was told, went to th e Nazis, to the Œ to the police, and said, 

several of our men died, we need  10 min Œ 
10 people to have a minyan. So  this Œ

and my  grandfather, I think was, came back, 
and my father was let out, and so forth. 
They  were Œ they did let 
people out. I don™t think 
Regensburg
 was Œ there were N-
Nazis, but I don™t think it was like in some 
of the other towns, that they were so 
awful. No w, I do have a picture here that shows my  father in a cart, being marched 
through the town . You know, 
they took all the men th
at day and marched them 
through the main street. It was called
 Maximilianstrasse
, I remember that, before 
they took Œ sent th
em off to either 
Dachau
 or the Œ or the prison. I have a picture of 
that. 

Q: And did your father ever desc
ribe his emotions after the war Œ 
A: No, not really Œ 
Q: Œ or discuss this photograph with you? 
A: Not really. Not really, no, no, he never 
did, uh-uh. On ly th
ing I remember, when 
he was let go, an-and we were co Œ we came home Œ when we knew he was home, 

and I remember him sitting at the Œ at the 
table in our family 
room, shaving off his 
beard. Course, he had a growth of beard 
for the Œ from the whole week, I guess. So 
I remember him sitting there shaving hi
s beard, that™s what I remember. 

Q: And what happened to the store? 
A: Well, my father was able to sell his 
store. Now th Œ I think he sold  it already 
before that. My grandfather still w as really
 plundered. That wa
s plundered and all

the windows were smashed, and I think I onc
e saw a little bit of 
it. But like I said, 
my family, I think they shie
lded us, you know, from this. 
They  didn™t Œ they didn™t 
want me to see it or whatever, you know. 
And of course, our synagogue was burned 
down . The schoolhouse that we Œ I attended, 
that™s next to the synagogue, that was 
not burned, only the synagogue.  
Q: And did you witn ess the fire? 

A: No, no, we lived too far away. 
No, we lived too far away, yeah. 
Q: And right after 
Kristallnacht
, when you tried to go to
 school Œ why don™t you 
tell me a little bit about schooling, when
 you had to move to a Jewish school, 
whether it was close Œ 
A: Well, I started right from a Jewish scho
ol, I never went to any other school. It 
was na Œ ah Œ ah Œ it was intermittent, beca
use I think our teacher left ha Œ wh ere is 
Œ it was a one room schoolhouse, basically, 
all the grades toge
ther, you know? And 
a Œ th-they were Œ there was intermittent 
because the teacher that finally came to 
our school came from the neighboring town called 
Straubing
, and he had to come 
on th e train. And if the train was late, 
he was late, so, you know, schooling was 
intermittent. So, actually I Œ I don™t rememb
er too much about 
that. I mean, it was 
basically I guess from Œ we were
 suppose Œ well, we were s
upposed to leave in Œ in 
August of ™39, or September of ™39, 
and just when the war Œ we had packed

everything up, after my  parents had made 
special furniture, small for here, because 
they knew the apartments 
here were much smaller, a
nd we moved in with my  
grandparents and then the war broke out. 
And it was Œ we were supposed  to go by 
way of
 England.
 
Q: Okay, before Œ I want to talk about em
igration, but let me 
ask one other question 
with this school; did they 
shut the school down  after 
Kristallnacht
? 
A: No, not really, 
that I remember. 
Q: So you were able the next da
y to just come back to school? 
A: No, I don™t rememb er it was Œ it was the next day or it was a few  weeks later. I 
really don™t have any recollection of that. 
Q: Uh-huh. Okay, let™s talk 
about emigration. Do you re
memb er listening to  your 
parent talk about wanting to leave 
Germany
, and what those discussions entailed? 
A: Oh yeah, I mean Œ 
Q: When they first wanted to leave 
[indecipherable]
 
A: Œ oh, well, I mean, we knew we were 
getting ready to leave, and that Œ like I 
said, my  parents, you know, had special fu
rniture made that wo
uld be smaller. Beds 
that would go up into th e wall, you know, 
things like that, because they knew here it 
would be a smaller place where we would be able to live. 

 
Interview with Ellen Zw eig   
 
March 2, 2010 
 

 
 
13
Q: And do they have any trou
ble getting emigration visas? 
A: No, my  father had a brother here, who 
had been here since 1926, I think, and 
through him we had the affi
davits. And we had numbers 
to go to th e consulate in 
Stuttgart
. And we did go there, you know, we
 had to have clearance as far as 
health was concerned and all that. So I rememb er going to 
Stuttgart
 where the Œ 
where the American consulate was, and 
you know, being chec
ked out and we Œ 
everything was okay, and we 
had the visas. Before nine
 Œ befo re September ™39. 
Q: And then  Œ describe what
 Œ you were saying th at y
ou were supposed to go to  
England
 and the war broke out, so Œ 
A: Well, yeah, I mean, that 
Œ that Œ then th e whole thing got scrapped because we 
couldn™t leave, we a-are Œ we had already 
packed all our things, so we moved in 
with my grandparents. And 
the Œ th e correspondence that I found after Œ actually 
my father™s death many, many years later, 
was regarding Œ the 
Americans evidently 
gave us a hard time because there were f
our of us, and my  father™s brother here 
wasn™t making enough money, although he 
worked for relatives 
here, and the Œ the 
ones Œ was very reluctant to put his name dow
n th at he would su pport us in case he 
di Œ we needed to. So
, I think th ey finally persuaded 
him, si Œ but we never took a 
penny from him, but just to put his 
name on the Œ on Œ you know, this Œ 
America
 
was in a depression at that time, so my  
uncle had a hard  time convincing them that 

 
Interview with Ellen Zw eig

14
even if we came here, he Œ 
we would not be a burden to  
them. So, you know, that Œ 
that I remember. You know, 
tha-that correspondence I read mon Œ many years later. 
My father didn™t die until 1984. But I found
 all that in correspondence. And it was 
even discussion about sending me to 
Switzerland
 because my father had relatives 
there, you know, so
 I found all that. 
Q: Let™s come back, so September ™39, you
™re packed and it falls through. Describe 
those even ts, so Œ 
A: Well, you know, I was Œ how old 
Œ was ™38, I was nine years old. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And I don™t think it™s Œ it really sunk in
. I just knew we couldn™t go. In fact, I 
remember a couple times ther
e was alarms if we were 
gonna get bombed, then we 
had to go down  to th
e cellar. But other than that, I do
n™t have mu ch  memo ry of that. 
I know my  family kept us busy doing arts 
and crafts at home. They always found 

things for Œ for me and my sister to 
do, to keep us busy
, I guess, you know. 
Q: And then  how did 
you finally get out? 
A: Well, we finally got left Œ in fact, 
it was my sister™s birthday, February 18
th
, 
1940, we took a train to 
Mu n i ch
 and we stayed in a hote
l I rememb er, and people 
came to see my father, to gi
ve him messages to take us
 to people that lived in 
America
, asking them to help. I think that™s wh at it was all about. And th e next day 

 
Interview with Ellen Zw eig

we took a train over the 
Brenner Pass
 to 
Italy
, to
 Genoa. 
And I remember I was 
very nervous crossing the
 Brenner Pass
, because you know, I did hear that they 
had taken people off the trains if they 
fo und smuggling anything, you know. If they 
put thing Œ people used  to hide things in 
the lining of their coats and all kinds of 
things. So we were worried about that. 
Q: And were you searched when  you crossed into
 Italy
? 
A: No, we were not searched, but just the 
thought of it made me sick  in my stomach 
after we left. But we Œ we got through. 
My  grandmother made sure we had nothing 
contra, because she didn™t want 
anything to happen to  us. 
Q: And then  after you arrived in 
Genoa
 Œ 
A: Well, we Œ we had to spend a few days
 there, and you know
, we walked around 
a little bit, we didn™t have much money, 
I guess, I don™t remember exactly. But, you 
know, my  parents Œ and th e place we were
 staying was pretty bad. I mean, I know 

that. And we finally boarded the pip Œ th-the
 Œ the ship and I have a picture of the 
ship, you know, and Œ 

Q: And this Œ 

A: Œ it was a terrible voyage for me, I got 
sick as a dog because of the weather. I 
mean, in Œ 

Q: Which month is 
this? This is Œ

A: Si Œ February Œ 
Q: Of ™40? 

A: Yeah, by way of the
 Mediterranean
, and the cross from 
Gibralta r
 and over to 
Œ to the 
States
 and we landed in
 New Yo rk. 
Q: Is the fact that the war was on, we Œ wa s there any fear of torpedoes or bomb ing, 

or you ju st se Œ 

A: If there was I didn™t know, but I barely 
got out of bed. And my  sister, she was 
fine, she went up to  eat dinner, she did ev
erything. Sh e was fine, but I was a sick 
one, yeah. The only thing I re
member, when we got near 
New York
, that my father 
actually carried me up to sh Œ see the Stat
ue of Liberty. That Œ that I remember. 
Q: What was your reaction? 

A: I don™t remember, really, 
I just remember that Œ that
 part of it, yeah, yeah. 
Q: So, let™s talk a little bit ab
out what happened
 once you got to
 New Yo rk. 
Did 
you start school imme diately, or 
did you wait for the next year? 
A: Well, no, we Œ we actually did not stay in 
New York.
 We stayed a few days with 
friends of ours as Œ from Œ from
 Regensburg
, had come earlier, 
and my siste r a nd I 
stayed with them, and my parents were i
nvited to stay with some other relatives 
who are already very well-to
-do, had been here, I guess
, for many, many years. And 
we, immediately after that, took a train to 
Wash ington,
 because my  uncle lived 

 
Interview with Ellen Zw eig

17
here in 
Washington
, and th e other relatives that Œ that
 they had, that had been here 
many years always lived in
 Wa shington
. So we came right to 
Wash ington, 
we 
never stayed  in
 New Yo rk
. 
Q: And what was your life like as a new i
mmi grant? Did you feel a lot of culture 
shock? Were you able to mix in with the American kids? 
A: Well, you know, it was a little bit diffi
cult. I had taken English lessons in 
Germany
 already, cause you know, my  parent
s knew that was gonna happen. So I 
had taken English lessons. We went to live 
with my  uncle the first four months or 
so. I mean, he ha Œ he
 had bought a little house, it wasn™t
 a very big house. It was in 
a good neighborhood called 
Glover
 
Park
, I don™t know if you™re familiar, off 
Wisconsin
 Avenue? And he had a wife and one 
son, an d also my  grandmother on Œ 
father™s mo ther had come right after 
Kristallnacht
, they brought her out Œ he 
brought her over here. So they  
were for Œ four, and we were 
four, eight of us in that 
little house. We, my parents and my sister 
and I all slept down in th e basement. It 
was a built out basement, but we stayed Œ 
you know, we lived there. And we were 
taken to the elementary school in th e ne
ighborhood, which Œ and they gave me 
some tutoring in math, I was Œ think I was 
be Œ I was like in th
e fifth grade then, 
because you know, I Œ I had a little Œ little Œ 
didn™t have that much schooling over 
there, so they gave me tu
toring, and they were very 
nice to us. And th en, I do

remember some kids calling us Nazis and 
stuff, you know, but y
ou know, we had to 
let go, wh at could we do, you know? We we
re here, we were safe, let™s put it that 
way. And the summer, during the summer, 
through the Jewish 
Community Center, 
we were sent to Camp
 Louise
, I don™t know if you Œ you may Œ so my  sister and I 
both were sent there for three weeks, whic
h was really nice of them to do that, you 
know, they did a lot, the Je
wish community and also the 
Washin gton
 Hebrew  
congregation, wh ere we finally ended up,
 which was mo stly juv Œ German Jews. 
Took us in, you know, so Œ 
Q: When you say took us in, what sort of Œ 

A: Well, let us go to Œ 
Q: Œ hospitality Œ 
A: Œ Sunday school, Su nday  school. And th
ey  had a newcomers club too, at that 
time that my parents, I think, you know, 
went to. So, yeah. An
-And eventually we 
were able to get an apartment 
Œ you want me to talk about it? 
Q: Sure, absolutely. 

A: I think th at following September, my  pare
nts were able to afford a one bedroom 
apartment for the four of us, you know. My
 father had gotten some work  th-through

Americans. And his first job was selling 
[indecipherable]
 door to door Œ not door 
to door, by recommendati
on, a comp any called 
Real Silk
. They sold socks, men™s 
socks and ties and I don™t know wh at else, you know, and he was able to make 
money, little bit of money, yo
u know, he wa Œ he was in 
Œ you know, so Œ and then 
Giant Food
, Mr.
 Cohen
 was very good to the Jewish
 immigrants here, and gave 
everybody a job. So he work
ed for them on the weekends. 
They Œ they only had, I 
think at that time, two stores in this area
, but he went to  work  on the weekends, you 
know, working there. 
Q: And how many immigrants were working th
ere? I™m actually ve
ry interested in 
this, to find out more about how the 
Jewish community he
re was helping the 
immigr Œ 

A: I Œ I really Œ I-I know Œ I mean, I really don™t know too many, I-I know a couple 

people that worked 
with him at that time, but I do
n™t really rememb er how many, 
but you know, he work ed ther
e, and th en Œ so I Œ all I know is one time one of them 
said to him, if you crack a few eggs, he™ll let you take th em home for free. So, you 

know, he was able to bring home some Œ so me eggs for us to have, you know. And 

you know, we managed. My si
ster and I went to school th en. My  mo ther also got a 
job working as a housekeeper for a fam
ily. You know, and th
en she eventually 
found a job work ing for a fam
ily where she basically took care of th e Œ the ch ildren

while the parents were working. So, you 
know, she Œ she had to work too, you 
know, they both wo rked , and we were kind 
of left to our own. At home we were 
supposed to clean the apartm
ent and stuff, you know? And my sister was a rebel. So 
Œ but, you know, we managed it, but th Œ 
after that Œ and then wh at happened , my  
grandparents, my mother™s parents were still in 
Germany
, and they  had a lot of 
trouble, they had to pay tax 
upon tax, and they  had to repa
ir the Œ the store front and 
everything, you know. They  taxed them be
cause they did have money. And th ey 
finally got out in May of 1940, wh ich was la
te. And th ey Œ they  used to have these, 
I don™t know if you™re familiar with the cl
osed trains? They were trains that were 
closed from
 Berlin
 to I think
 Lisb on, Portugal.
 Well, by the time they were ready 
to leave, there were no more closed trai
ns, it had stopped already. And this is all 
secondhand, because I heard the story th
rough my aunt who stayed behind, you 
know, who was married, my mo
ther™s sister was married 
to the Gentile. They went 
Œ they were in
 Munich
, and they went to the airline 
and she gave them one ticket. 
And they  just said no, we™re not go Œ one 
Œ either we both go or we don™t go. And 
so my  aunt said, you gotta 
shmear
 them, you know, give them a little money under 
the table. Maybe tomorrow you™ll Œ so sh
e did, next day she had two tickets. I 
mean, there Œ there were people that were 
not bad, they  helped. And so they got on

a plane and they were
 able to go to 
Lisbon, Portugal
, and from there they took a 
ship, one of those last few out of 
Lisbo n  
to 
New York 
City. 
Q: And came to
 Washington
? 
A: Yeah, well, they were
 supposed to stay in 
New York
 with my Œ with their son, 
who had come earlier, and he was drafted by then. So th
ey all came to 
Wa sh ingto n
, 
in the one bedroom apartmen
t, in May of 1940. And yo
u know, we managed a hot 
summer, no air conditioning. And I think in 
September finally, my family was able 
to get a two bedroom apartment. So my  gran dparents had a room, my sister and I 
had a room and my  parents 
were sleeping in the living room. That™s how it was, you 
know. But we were there from 1941 until 1948.  And I went to high school there, 
you know, out of that milie
u, I mean, we managed. 
Q: And during the rest of the war years, 
from ™40 to ™45, how mu ch correspondence 
and communication was there with your aunt who was still in 
Germany
? 
A: Well, there were relatives of
 my father™s who had lived in 
Switzerland
 for many 
years already, had come back long before
. And thro ugh them we were able to 
communicate. I mean, like we sh 
Œ we would send a letter to 
Switzerland
, and I 
guess there was Œ maybe send her a postc
ard saying, heard from, you know, 
everything is okay, and she would write a 
postcard back, without a return sender,

I™m sure, ju st to say I™m okay, or something.
 So that way, they 
knew that they were 
okay, you know. That™s th Œ th
ey were the intermediaries. 
Q: And what was your Œ do you have any 
memo ry of news sources during th e war? 
How you were foll Œ how much  news was reaching th e 
United States
, how you 
followed it? 
A: Well, like I say, that Œ you know, I rememb er 
Pearl Harbor
, that I remember, 
and you know, during the war, 
I mean, I don™t think there was Œ we didn™t know 
that much. I mean, nobody 
really knew it, although I un
derstand, there was corres Œ 
that people knew Œ well, my  aunt 
in ger Œ who stayed behind in 
Germ any
 to ld  me 
after the war that when the soldiers came
 back from the eastern front, the German 
soldiers, they told 
her what was going on over there,
 they knew about it. But of 
course, they were afraid to talk, I guess, 
because they would have been shot too, 
you know. But she knew wh at was going on. 

Q: Even throughout the war?
 During the war, this ha Œ 
A: Well, probably a little bit later. Well, there were my cousins, my father™s sister, 

one sister, one sister got out with her husb
and. The other ones didn™t. They stayed Œ 
they se Œ actually sent their children to 
Eng land
 on the
 Kindertransport
. And by 
the time they wanted to leave,
 they just couldn™t get out any mo re. And my  aunt told 
me Œ this was after the war Œ that they 
came to say goodbye to her, and she knew 

 
Interview with Ellen Zw eig   
 
March 2, 2010 
 

 
 
23
what was gonna happen. She 
knew about it. Course, she didn™t tell them, you know, 
they Œ in  fact, my  cousin who now lives he
re said to me, she 
also, through Œ they 
had a very  good housekeeper wh o helped
 th em have Œ through, you know, you Œ 
she said, her mo ther went out and had wa
rm clothes made, because she knew they 
were going east. They were 
one of the last deported. 
Q: And do you know where 
they were deported to? 
A: Yeah, I ha Œ I think it was 
Auschwitz
, and actually, she just found out not long 
ago that her mo ther was not gassed immediat
ely. Her father was, and he was one of 
seven brothers, and I think five of them, 
they were gassed imme Œ they were older, 
they were gassed imme diately, but her 
mo ther was working, sewing or doing 
something, and she co ntracted typhoid feve
r, and then that™s what did her in. So, 
you know, but that was my  fa
ther™s second sister. The first one was able to get out 
and lived in
 New York City.
 So, you know. So they™re
 Œ they™re the only close 
relatives th at we really  lost. And they we
re very Orthodox, you 
know, they were the 
kind that thought God will help, and you 
know. It was a big family. The name was 
Einstein
, and they were from
 Augsburg.
 And they were a Œ cattle dealers and they 
were well-to-do, I mean, they just di Œ 
n-never thought anything like this would 
happen. By the time th ey really wanted
 to get out, they  wanted to go to 
Rhodesia, 
and they  wouldn™t take children. So, you 
know, they just didn™t believe it would 

 
Interview with Ellen Zw eig

24
ever happen, because 
with their money, they were 
better off Œ well a Œ better off 
than I think my family was.
 But they just didn™t belie
ve, you know, they were Œ 
Q: And when Œ when your father found ou
t about his sister Œ how much after the 
war he learned? 
A: Well, I don™t know, I don™t remember th
at, when it was. I-I™m not sure exactly 
how long it was. 

Q: So Œ so, before we conc
lude, I guess, the last questi
ons, did your parents Œ did 
you notice any change after 
they learned about the war, 
difficulties adjusting to the 
United States
, to what extent they discussed th
is? How much talk was there in your 
house wh en you were in Œ already older, in
 high school, or like college, about what 
had happened? 

A: Well, I don™t think there was too much 
talk about it. The one thing I should tell 
you is my  mo ther, unfortunately, when  we fi
nally Œ th ey got on th
eir feet, they were 
able to buy a house in 1949, I guess. 
My mo ther had gotten sick, and she had 
cancer. So, I mean, that was a real proble
m, you know. My grandparents were still 
living with us, her parents, and she passe
d away in 1950. I m
ean, I w as able to 
finish high school, but college, I had to
 pay my  own way and I never finished 
because, you know, I had to help my fath er actually, after my mother passed away. 

So that kind of put a dent in it. And th e 
fact that they were 
fairly young, we spoke 

 
Interview with Ellen Zw eig

mo stly English in our house. And of cour
se my  grandparents weren™t happy with 
what happened in 
Euro pe
 and everything, and my  gran
dfather took it very hard 
when  my  mo ther passed away, so you know
. And then I do remember after the war 
was over that they sent packages over ther
e for my  aunt and he
r family every week. 
And they  also had another Œ a group calle
d self help, and they
 were mostly the 
German Jewish refugees here, that sent 
packages over to Œ to people. Food, you 
know, to help whoever was left, or whoeve
r survived. I do reme
mber that. So, you 
know, d-discussion, I really don™t reme mb er 
that mu ch, that they ever talked about 
it too much. So, you know, luck
ily that they Œ my
 mother™s sister
 survived.That 
was a big thing already, you know. And act
ually, her brother who ended up in the 
army, went to see her. I think that was Œ 
happened, you know, after liberation, and 
did find that she was in Œ 
you know, they were okay, yo
u know, that they survived, 
let™s put it that way. So, you know, so Œ 

Q: And they remained in 
Germany
 throughout the rest of th
eir lives, or did they  Œ 
A: Yeah, they remained in 
Germany
. They did come over 
here. My grandparents 
were able to celebrate their 50
th
 wedding anniv Œ well, she came  over first, I think in  
Œ after my mother had passed away alrea
dy, and then  they came over for my  
grandparents 50
th
 wedding anniversary. So that wa
s, you know. But my  aunt Œ and 
she came back a few more times after her 
husband passed away, and to ld me that

after everybody had left, she had never c
onverted to Catholicis
m when she married 
him, but she said, after everybody left, she 
felt like she needed 
to belong someplace. 
She felt alone, you know, and Œ not that sh
e was strong in Judaism, but she became 
Catholic.  
Q: Did she ever feel any unease living in 
Germ any
, or Œ 
A: Yeah, she did, sh e did. Sh e said even  after Œ she had moved to  
Munich
, and sh e 
had an apartment there, and she said wh
enever she came over here to visit, she 
would never say she™s coming to see her 
fami ly, cause she didn™t want everybody Œ 
anyone to know that she wa
s Jewish originally, and said she was coming to see 
friends. So she did have a certain amount
 of unease about letting people know that 
she was Jewish. Bu t we have kept in touch 
with the cousins. In fact, the children of 
one of the cousin s just came Œ was here vi
siting with me, and he
r husband. And you 
know, my  children have gone over and stay
ed with them. So we have a good rela Œ 
I mean, they were never Nazi, none of th
em Nazis, you know. Of course, they were 
children too, but Œ and we Œ my  husband an
d I had visited over there, you know, so 
we have kept up the relati
onship, you know. So they  
know who we are, and we 
know who they are, and then
, you know, they™re not Œ th
ey™re not strong Catholics 
either, you know. But yeah, 
we do have the relations
hip with them, yeah.

Q: So, is there anything else that you™
d like to say, that you feel we haven™t 
covered? 
A: No, I Œ I think Œ no, you definitely 
Œ mother™s mother, my grandmother, was 
very Œ very active in the 
community, in our town, as 
Œ has rubbed double off on me, 
because I have gotten involv
ed here in a lot of comm
unity things. I mean, I was 
very active in 
BBG
, and you know, president of my
 BBG
 group, and active in adult 
things, you know. And I™m active here in
 the Jewish residence, and now I™m 
president of a group of widows and widowers, whic
h meets at the 
JCC
, so I think it 
somehow rubbed off on me to be
 active and give Œ give back. 
Q: Mm-hm. And if ste Œ 
A: And also volunteer at the Holocaust Museum. 
Q: And is the fact that you came to the 
United Sta tes
 as an immigrant affected your 
attitudes about anything, do you think? 

A: Well, I™m Œ I™m Œ I™m a liberal, let™s put
 it that way. You know, I™m kind of hope 
things, and always wish that things w
ould get better here, an
-and hope, you know. 
So, you know, tell my  children about Œ th
ey know about my 
background, they 
know, and you know, that it 
was hard, I Œ you know, I had to pull my self up by my  
bootstraps, and had to  pay fo
r everything myself, it wasn™t given to me on a silver 
platter, so Œ although, my  parents did get 
some resti tution even
tually, but it wasn™t

mu ch, and you know, basically
 I had to fend for myself
. And luckily, when I met 
my  husband Œ he was also from 
Germany
, he was from
 Hamburg
, but he had 
established himself over here by that Œ 
he came a little earlier, 1937, and had 
become a photographer and Œ and had opene
d a studio, and I felt it was my  duty to 
help him, so I became like the manager of 
the place. So, you know,
 we both worked 
hard, and you know, we made a fairly good
 living, you know. And started all over.  
Q: Well, thank you so mu
ch. This concludes the 
United States 
Holocaust Memorial 
Museum interview with
