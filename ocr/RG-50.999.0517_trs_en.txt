Sylv ia Rozines  was  born Cy wia Per elmuter to J ewis h parents Ic ek and Chaja on Januar y
 
20, 
1935 in Lodz, Poland.  Her  father  worked in a wholes ale flour and s ugar cooper ative and her mother  

c ar ed for Sylv ia and her  older  s is ter Dwora, who was  s even year s  older .  This  photogr aph of Sylvia was  

taken ar ound 1938.
 
 
On this  map of Poland the arr ow points  to Lodz.
 
 
Her e we s ee Sylv ia on the left, her father  in the m iddle, and her older s ister, Dwor a, on the 
r ight.  Sylvia was  about 3 years  old when this  photo was  taken.
 
 
In September
 
1939, when Sylvia was  4 year s  old,
 
Germ any invaded Poland offic ially 
beginning WorldWar II.  Within s even days  German tr oops  enter ed and occ upied the c ity of Lodz.  This  
his toric  photogr aph s hows  Germ an tr oops enter ing Lodz.
 
 
In Februar y
 
1940, German author ities  establis hed a ghetto in Lodz.  J ews  lived is olated fr om 
the r es t of the c ity in an area enc los ed by barbed
-
wir e fenc ing.  The s ign in this  Germ an postcard of 

2 
 
Lodz reads , "J ewis h r es idential area
 
--
 
entr y for bidden."  German author ities  began depor tations  in 
1942 fr om the ghetto to 
the Chelm no killing c enter .  The deportations targeted c hildr en but Sylv ia's  
father managed to find differ ent hiding plac es  for her.  Then in 1944 m ost of the r em aining J ews  in Lodz 
were deported to Aus c hwitz
-
Bir kenau.  Sylvia's  parents and s ister avoided 
deportation bec aus e they 
were c hos en to c lean the ghetto.  They hid Sylvia in a c ellar  along with 11 other J ewis h c hildren whos e 

par ents r em ained working in Lodz.  In J anuar y of 1945, the Soviet Arm y liber ated the 800 r em aining 

J ews  from the Lodz ghetto.
 
 
Sylv ia's  fam ily reloc ated to a dis plac ed per sons  cam p in Germ any.  In this  photograph we see 
Sylv ia at the dis plac ed per s ons c am ps in 1947.  Sylv ia eventually lived in Par is  until imm igr ating to the 
United States  in 1957.
 
 
After living 10 years  in Franc e, Sylvia and her  father imm igr ated to the United States  in 1957 
joining Dwora and her hus band J ack  who had moved ear lier  to Albany, New Yor k.  Sylvia got a job in a 

dr es s s hop.  She m arr ied David Roz ines , who was  als o a Holoc aus t s ur vivor, in 1959.  David work ed in 
s ales . They had a s on Greg, who gr aduated with a degree in engineering from the State Univer s ity of 
New York at Binghamton.  Sylvia went to night school and then went to work for the New York  Public  
Sc hools , where s he work ed for  24 year s .
 
 
Sylv ia's
 
hus band David pas s ed away in 1999 at age 69.  Sylvia moved to the Was hington, 
DC, ar ea to be c lose to her  s on.  Sylv ia has  two grandc hildren, J effery and Alys s a.
 
 
Sylv ia began volunteering with this  Mus eum's Vis itor Servic es  in 2014.  You will find her at
 
the 
Infor mation Desk  on Mondays .  Sylv ia only r ec ently began s peaking about what s he went thr ough in 

the Lodz ghetto and is  now s peaking in loc al s c hools .  In c ollabor ation with her niec e
, 
J ennifer Roy, 
Sylv ia's  s tor y was publis hed with the title "Yellow Star ."  Her book
, 
whic h has  now s old 150,000 c opies , 
is  us ed widely in s c hools  and has been publis hed in a number of c ountries inc luding Br azil, Belgium , 

the Netherlands , Germany and Spain.
  
Following today's  progr am, Sylvia will be available to s ign 
c opie
s  of "Yellow Star ."
  
 
With that, I would like you to join m e in welc oming our Firs t Pers on, Sylvia Rozines .     
 
 
Sylv ia, pleas e join us . 
 
 
[Applaus e]
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Sylvia, thank  you s o m uc h for joining us, for your  willingnes s  to be our
 
Firs t Pers on

This  is your fir s t time with us .  So this is  ver y exc iting for  all of us to have you her e.  You have jus t so 

m uc h to tell us in a s hor t tim e
; 
s o we'll star t.
 
 
You wer e not yet 5 when Ger m any invaded Poland September
 
1, 1939, star tingWor ldWar II.  
Befor e 
we turn to the war and the Holoc aus t and what happened to your  family, tell us  what you c an a 
little bit about your fam ily and c ommunity in the year s  before the war  began.
 
> > Sylvia Rozines :  I c ould s ay we had a ver y nic e life.  Fam ily was  ver y c los e.  We
 
c elebr ated holidays  
together.  Always  in our hous e bec aus e my m om was  the best c ook.  My father had two brother s .  We 
all got together .  I c an s ee m y par ents loved to get dres s ed up
.  
I had beautiful c lothes.  I had my doll 
and a c arr iage.  We lived a norm al life.  Never  expec ting this is  going to happen.
 
 
My m other loved to go to the movies, Am er ic an movies , bec aus e they were s till not talking.  
She us ed to 
go 
off and see them .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  She liked the s ilent films ?
 
> > Sylvia Rozines :  Silent movies
, yes .  They loved to go danc ing.  We had a pr etty good life until the 
Germ an oc c upied.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Your father worked in the flour bus ines s .  Sales , is that what he did?
 
> > Sylvia Rozines :  Yes .  The flour but als o ther e wer e fr uit, c om ing fr om differ ent c ountr ies.  Every 

week he brought two bananas  and two or anges .  Th
is
 
was  a luxur y at that time for my s is ter  and me.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And you r em em ber  that as a little girl?
 

> > Sylvia Rozines :  Oh, yes .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  How large was  your extended fam
ily? 
 
> > Sylvia Rozines :  Quite large.  My m other's  s ide, m y grandma had s even or eight c hildren.  My father 

had only
 
--
 
ther e wer e two br others and two s is ters .

> > Bill Bens on:  So it s ounds  like a lot of c ous ins.
 
> > S ylvia Rozines :  Yes . 
 
> > Bill Bens on:
  
Within seven days  of Nazi Germany's  invas ion of Poland, within s even days  they 
oc c upied your c ity of Lodz, unleas hing the war s  of the Holoc aus t for  your  family and the nearly almos t a 
quar ter million J ews  who lived in Lodz.  Tell us  what you c an about what happened to you and your  
family onc e the Germans wer e in Lodz but in that tim e before you wer e forc ed into the ghetto, in the 

or iginal part of their oc c upation, when they fir s t c am e in.
 
> > Sylvia Rozines :  I r emem ber ver y little from that tim e.  I know we lived in one large r oom and a 

kitchenette.  Later on there wer e s o m any people we had to take in another  fam ily with one c hild
, w
hic h 
div ided the r oom with c urtains  and they lived on the other s ide.  And that little girl bec ame m y best 

fr iend.
 
 
In the b
eginning we wer e getting rations , a little bit m ore food to eat.  But food was  the main 
thing, how to c r eate r ec ipes  to m ak e whatever they gave us . We had to wait in line.  Som etimes you 

waited and it was  gone.  So that was  the main thing, how to get food.  When you'r e hungry, it's  terr ible. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Sylvia, befor e you went into the ghetto, if I unders tand c orrec tly, the fam ily went to 

Wars aw.
 
> > Sylvia Rozines :  Yes .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Tell us a little bit about that.
 
> > Sylvia Rozines :  When the Germ an invaded, they dec ided Lodz is  going to bec ome Germany.  Lodz 
had factories and was n't bombed. War s aw was des troyed.  And they s aid when the J ewis h people 
c annot stay ther e and we had to leave forWars aw in a hor s e and buggy, at night.  And it was  wi
nter.  It 
was  s o c old.  We arr ived in Wars aw.  There was  no hous es .
 

> > Bill Bens on:  Bec ause ever ything had been bom bed?
 
> > Sylvia Rozines :  Bombed.  The whole s treets bom bed.  So m y father  dec ided to go back .  And that 
was  a good dec is ion
 w
hat he did.  He
 
m ade m any good dec is ions during the war.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  He s ur e did.
 
> > Sylvia Rozines :  And we went back to the apartm ent.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You told m e that he had 
--
 
bes ides  m aking good dec is ions, he had s ever al 
pr emonitions.
 
> > Sylvia Rozines :  Yes .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And this was  one of his  premonitions ? 
 
> > Sylvia Rozines :  He only tells  us  about the one when he and his  br other dec ided to leave Poland 

before the Ger mans  ar rived to find a plac e in Russ ia and jus t them c ome bac k  and get the wives  and 

ch
ildr en.  At the las t m inute my father dec ided, lik e a premonition, he didn't want to go.  His  brother 
dec ided to go.  And dur ing this  he los t a wife and one c hild.  Bec aus e the fir s t thing the Germans took , 

the women who didn't have hus bands .
 
> > Bill B ens o
n:  So his  br other by going
 
--
 
> > Sylvia Rozines :  He sur vived but the wife and c hild didn't s ur vive.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  If I unders tand, als o, s oon after the oc c upation as  the Nazis  began making m or e 

r es tr ic tions , one of the firs t things  you had to do was  wear  the yellow s tar .
 
> > Sylvia Rozines :  Yes .  We had to wear  it on the fr ont and in the back.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  On the fr ont of your  c lothes ?
 
> > Sylvia Rozines :  Front and back .  And the s ame on the back . We only had s o m any s tars.  So when 

you c hanged c lothes, you had to change the star.  Sometimes  we were wearing it with pins
 a
nd 
s om etimes  sewn up.  But even after the war when we took off the star, the c lothes wer e old.  You c ould 
s till s ee the s hadow of the s tar .  And I wouldn't wear  the jewelr y, the yellow s tar, bec aus e of this.  I 
would wear  any other but not the star. 
 
> > Bill Bens on: Within a few m onths  after  the occ upation in ear ly 1940, soon after you tur ned 5, you 

and your fam ily were am ong the 160,000 J ews  that wer e for c ed out of your hom es  into
 
the Lodz ghetto.  
Tell us about the ghetto and what the c onditions  wer e like there in the ghetto for  you as you s tar ted to 
des c r ibe you wer e for c ed into a very tiny s pac e.
 

4 
 
> > Sylvia Rozines :  Yes .  It was  ver y c r owded.  One little boy asked m e one tim e what was  the c olors  of 
your  ghetto.  It was  gray and black.  Bec aus e we didn't even s ee dir t.  There was  no food for them  to 
find.  No animals.  It was  no s chools.  So I c ouldn't go to s c hool.  
 
 
My par ents  went to wor k  and the other  parents on the s ame floor s , ther e wer e two families .  In 
or der to have c om pany ins tead to s tay by m ys elf in the hous e, the fir st year my s is ter s
tayed
 
with me.  
Then s he had to go to work.  So s he was  s afe.  She was  pr oduc tive.  She went with m y mother to a 
fac tor y that wer e making women undergarm ents .  I was  left alone.  I always went to this other  little girl 
who had a little brother in the c r ib who was n't well. We stayed together
 s
o not to be by ours elves .  Two 
of the par ents c ame home and m ade som e food to eat.
 

> > B ill Bens on
: When you s ay they went to wor k , that was , of c ours e, that was  forc ed labor.
 
> > Sylvia Rozines :  Of cours e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  They were m ade to do that. 
 
> > Sylvia Rozines :  Nobody was  getting paid what we did.  It was  for c ed labor.  They ask  eac h pers on 
what was  his  profes s ion before the war .  So if he was  a tailor , he went to a factor y m aking unifor ms for  
the German and s uits .  And m y father, it was  luck y that he was  in the food bus ines s ; s o he would bring 
flour to the bak er ies .  They were baking black, round br ead for  us.  You rec eived that br ead.  I don't 
r em em ber how long it had to las t you. 
 
 
So my father s om etim es  c ould get a little flour.  The bags  were made out of c loth.  So 
s om etimes  you c ould make a little hole and get a little flour .  And then they div ided with the group. 
 
They worked by gr oup.  If one p
er s on c ouldn't tak e the flour
 
--
 
th
ey had large packets , and the flour was  
going behind the packets.  And then they went to one hous e, s c ale, weigh it, and every m an had to go 

hom e with a little bit for the family.  I thought that was  wonder ful what they did.  One time one person 
c ould take
 
it and the other  c ouldn't.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And when they would take a little bit of extr a flour, that was  a great risk  to them.  
Wasn't it?
 
> > Sylvia Rozines :  Of cours e.  Of c our s e.  Becaus e the baker weighed this  after .  So all they c ould 

take was  like
 
a handful from eac h.  The bag had 100
 
kilos .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So jus t let a little bit out.
 
> > Sylvia Rozines :  Like a handful, yeah.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Enough of them were able to get a handful eac h
; 
ther e might be a little bit.
 
> > Sylvia Rozines :  So m y m
other c ould m ake some noodles out of it, with water, of c our s e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And 
as
 
you s aid, trying to c ome up with rec ipes  to make that little bit of flour into 
s om ething differ ent was  a huge c hallenge.
 
> > Sylvia Rozines :  And to find food.  But in the summ er it was  a little bit eas ier .  In the c ourtyar d was  

c em ent.  The m e
n digged out the c ement
 
and everybody r ec eived a piec e of land to plant potatoes.  I 
only r em em ber  beets  and potatoes . 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So you had a little bit
 
--
 
> > Sylvia Rozines
:  In the s ummer, yeah.  So we had a little bit of vegetables .
 
> > Bill B ens on:  So a little
 
vegetables, flour and bread was  bas ic ally what you had to eat.
 
> > Sylvia Rozines :  Yes .
 
> > Bill Bens on: What you wer e ther e during that tim e
 
--
 
you made friends wi
th a c ouple of little girls, if I 
r em em ber.
 
> > Sylvia Rozines :  Yes .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Tell us a little bit about them.
 
> > Sylvia Rozines :  One little girl lived r ight across
 
--
 
it was  an apartment hous e.  She had a little 
br other.  He was  always  s ic k .  I realize now that he pas s ed away before the ghetto was  liquidated.  I 

jus t im agined he had leukemia, like.  Bec aus e he pas s ed away.
 
 
We wer e very c los e.  Even m y par ents and her  parents.  When there was the liberation, they 
got s ick , the m other and the daugh
ter.  And my father helped them to go to the train.  He c am e home.  
He was  s o upset.  He s aid, "I don't think they're going to make it."  And the father never c am e back .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Thes e two fr iends, Hava
 
--
 

5 
 
> > Sylvia Rozines :  Hava, I know her sec ond name, Kaufm an.  Itk a I don't remem ber.  Itka lived with 
us .  And the three of us tr ied to find s om e toys .  One day, m us t have been a neighbor, we had 
s heets
 
--
 
the Germ an didn't take away our c lothes and s heets.  So s he held up s heets and m ade little 
dol
ls, stuffed it
;  
with a penc il s he made the eyes
,  
and c lothes.  So we play ed with thos e. We dres sed 
them.  We undr es sed them . We had s om ething to play. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  At one point you des c ribed in your  book  when you found your doll had dis appeared.  
Yo
ur  doll had dis appear ed.
 
> > Sylvia Rozines :  Yes .  With the c arr iage.
 
> > Bill Bens on: With the c arr iage.  What do you think happened to it?
 
> > Sylvia Rozines :  I think  that m y father us ed to trade ever ything
 
for food under  the bar bed
-
wir e
.  
Polis h people lived ther e.  They didn't have m uc h. We had lots of c lothes.  So he gave s ome c lothes  

and they gave us  s ome food. 
 
In the beginning, the Ger man didn't stay and guard the fenc e.  But later  
on we c ouldn't bec aus e ther e was  a Germ an s tanding and he c ould s ee.  And onc e you do this , they 

would s hoot you.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So your  ability to tr y to get food and tr ading was  gone.
 
> > Sylvia Rozines :  Food was  bec oming the most im portant thing.  How to s urvive.
  
When you went to 
war, in the factor ies they gave you 
s ome s oup.  Ther e was  a kitc hen.  I r emember ever ybody put the 

s poon to s ee how m any piec es  of potato.  If you had three piec es, you were lucky.  It was  m os tly water.
 

> > Bill Bens on:  As terr ible as  the c onditions were in the ghetto, as you've des c ribed, t
her e bec am e far  
wors e when the Nazis  began deporting J ews  fr om  the ghetto to the Chelm no killing c enter  in J anuary of 

1942, as you were tur ning 7.  In 1943
 
--
 
the deportations began in 1942.  In 1943 they bec am e ver y 
intent on taking all the c hildr en.  Once deportations  began, what was  your  life like after that?  What did 

you are your  parents
 
--
 
did your  parents  do to pr otec t you?  As  you des cribed to us , Dwor a and your 
par ents, they had jobs  so they wer e s afe for  the mom
ent
. 
> > Sylvia Rozines :  Exac tly.
 
>>
 
Bill Bens on:  But you wer e ver y vulner able.
 
> > Sylvia Rozines :  At that tim e I r eally lived in fear .  Fr om 1943 to 1945 I lived in fear they ar e going to 

take m e away.
  
In the beginning, they us ed to c om e dur ing the day with paper s .  They knew this  fam ily
 
had s o m any c hildren.  The first tim e they c ame
 
--
 
you hear nois e in the street.  People start s c reaming.  
So he gr abbed me and we hid in a plac e.  And the s ec ond tim e we hid in the s ame plac e.  But then the 

Germ an found out wher e the par ents  were hiding the c hildren.
 
 
My wors t nightmare is  when my father
 
--
 
ther e was  a cem eter y ac r os s  our  c ourtyar d.  Ther e 
was  a bric k  wall.  I don't know how he c limbed
 
--
 
m y father was  very s trong.  He c limbed the brick wall.  
I r em ember he grabbed m e and pus hed me over  and he digged a hole and he bur ied me ther e and put 
the gras s  and the str aw.  The good thing was  he didn't leave m e there.  I saw other  c hildren being left 
alone just s itting between stones but he made believe he's  c leaning, like a c leaning per s on.  The 
gro
und.  And we s tayed 48 hours until m y s is ter came.  She was  a teenager .  She s ays , "I don't know 
how I c lim bed that wall
,
" but s he did to tell us  we c ould go hom e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  For 48 hour s  you were hidden in the c emetery.
 
> > Sylvia Rozines :  Yes .  This  kind of left m e ver y bad m emories bec aus e after the war  I had
 
--
 
for 10 
year s  I had that dream.  It was  c oming like maybe onc e a m onth or m aybe twic e a month.  But the 

s am e dr eam
.  
I'm buried and the Ger man is  ups tair s  with a gun and my father  
stays  next
 
to him.  And I 
s ay, "H
e's going to kill me" and I wake up
 i
n the same dr eam.  I c am e to Am er ic a, the dream s topped.  I 
never had it.
  
I s tar ted to talk  to c hildr en
 
and I was  afraid this was  going to c ome back but it never  did.  
So that's why I was  able to do it.
 
 
But I was  a ver y vengeful lady, even in m y 50s .  I lived in Roc hes ter, New York.  I was  asked 
to s peak  to s c hools.  I did it one time.  I had a fr iend who did it every day.  I jus t c ouldn't do it.  I jus t 
didn't
 
--
 
I was  ups et.  So I stopped.
 
 
When I moved to Mar y land, m y niec e s tarted to talk about the book, ever ything started c oming 
bac k  and I'm able now.  I have no dr eams, nothing.  And I'm glad I c an do it now.
 
> > Bill Bens on: We ar e, too, Sylvia.

As  you des c ribed, you hid a number of tim es  in the c emetery.
 
> > Sylvia Rozines :  The c emeter y was  the one tim e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And then the Germ ans  r ealized that people wer e hiding in the c em eter y.
 
> > Sylvia
 
Rozines :  Yes .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So what did you do then? 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Then the Ger man notic ed they're not going
 
to
 
win.  Mor e than half of the c hildr en out.  
So they dec ided that one fam ily c an keep one c hild.  So I was  the c hild.  I rec eived a paper.  And ever y 
tim e the Germ an c ame and we had to go out in the c ourtyar d, we s howed them the paper.  I was  s afe.  
But m any people had two c hildr en and they had to make decis ions .  It was  horrible.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  That happened to I think  one of your  own r e
latives .  Didn't it?
 
> > Sylvia Rozines :  Yes
, 
to a friend. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Sylvia, y ou des c r ibed in your  book  the tim es  when you wer e alone at hom e, in the 
apar tm ent, and you had nothing to play with,
 
your  dolls  wer e gone; you made up gam es .  Can you tel
l 
us  about that?

I c annot, to tell you the tr uth, we wer e s
o young.  We didn't 
have any s c hooling.  We didn't even s tar t kindergar ten.  So what we did, we s tayed together.  I don't 

know if we talked what we talked.  For s ome r eason this  part I don't r em ember well.  But I do r emem ber 
it was  s o c old in the winter .  My father took  som e fur niture to m ake a fire in the oven s o we c an be 

warm .  But after a while ther e was  very few fur niture, like a table and c hair, a bed he 
left.  We had night 
tables  and a nic e little lamp.  So when I was  c old, and by m ys elf, I us ed to put a lamp and a c loth, and 

imagine the s un is s hining.  That's  what I remem ber.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  One of the things  you wrote about in the book  was  looking at 
things from differ ent 
angles  just to k eep your self oc c upied
, l
ike laying on the floor and look
ing
 
up.  The desc r iption of that is  
s o powerful in your book  of pas s ing the time.
 
> > Sylvia Rozines :  The tim e.  When we wer e buy  our s elves .  I was  s o happy when m y par ents  c ame 

hom e.  Then m y m other s tart
ed
 
to make s om e dinner.  I had s om eone to talk.  But having the two little 
fr iends , we were always  the thr ee together.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And then you los t one of the friends .  Right?
 
> > Sylvia Rozines :  Both of them .  They didn't c ome back . 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Although your  parents  were able to keep you hidden, for  the fam ily to remain together  

under thes e conditions  that becam e even m or e improbable in the s umm er  of 1944 when the Nazis  
dec ided it was  tim e they were going to liquidate the ghetto.  There were 75,000 Jews  s till in the ghetto 
and they wer e going to send them  all to Aus c hwitz
-
Bir kenau.  How was  it that your fam ily
 
--
 
des cr ibe to 
us  what happened that made it pos s ible for you all to not be s ent on the trains
 
to Auschwitz. 
 
> > Sylvia Rozines :  They needed s ome people to c lean up the belongings .  Ever ybody left their  

belongings , fur nitur e, beautiful things from befor e the war.  They needed str ong people to be able to go 
fr om  hous e
-
to
-
hous e becaus e the ghetto bec am e a ghos t town.  So they decided to leave 800 people.  
 
 
We wer e going thr ough a s elec tion.  If you were young, you went left.  That m eans  to 
Germ any.  When our family s tood before the Ger man who made the dec is ion, the leader from the 

ghetto, he s aid 
to
 
m y father , you s tr ong, m y m other is  good, my s ister  but bec aus e of m e we have to go 
left. We were going to go.  We had one box pack ed and a bottle of water.  And this is  the s ec ond time 

m y father ha
d the pr em onition.  He s ays , "I™m  not going."  And ever ybody looked at him.  And he's  
c r azy.  They s aid, "Y
ou're going to die here."  He s ays
 
--
 
I went
 
--
 
they put us  in 
two big fac tor ies .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  J us t explain a bit m ore.  So you did not know, of c our s e, where the tr ains  were going to 
take you.  So that's when people thought your father  was  c r azy to say I'm  not going on that tr ain.
 
> > Sylvia Rozines :  We didn't know what was  happening. We didn't have any r adios . We didn't know 
what was  happening.  But for s om e reas on many people thought onc e you leave
 
this , then you're going 
to die.  You us ed to s ay, oh
 
--
 
I us ed to hear people
 
--
 
people tried to occ upy their  time.  They us ed to 
s ay:  Let's live a little becaus e later we're going to fr y.  I am tr ans lating it.  So we had s om ething like 
they thought it's
 
wors e.  And s om e people thought, oh, we go there.  The Germ an us ed to tell us  the 
pr opaganda on the loud s peaker s
: G
ive you
r  
c hildren away
. T
hey're going to have food
. T
hey're going 

7 
 
to have m ilk.  I didn't r emember what m ilk tas ted and what was  an egg.  So s om e parents dec ided to 
give away their  c hildr en
a
nd s ome people wanted to go. 
 
 
So it was  the 800 people when they left to c lean up.  My father s aw the factories  had a 
bas ement.  He dec id
ed
 
--
 
he s aid to his  friends, "I
'm going to put 
m y little girl in 
the bas em ent.
  
My 
nam e is on the lis t.  And I'm going to s tay.
ﬂ 
 
Some of his  friends and one br other lis tened to him .  Som e people were afraid to lis ten to him .  
He s ays , "I m ade the decis ion for m e.  Now you have to m ak e your  own dec is ion bec aus e I don't 
k now 
what's  going to happen."  And s om e did.  And that's why it was  childr en, thos e 12 c hildr en in the book
,  
s ur vived.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Before you tell us mor e about what happened when your par ents and Dwora were part 

of the c leanup, 800 people during c leanup, bec aus e your father was  s o dec is ive, tell us  about what he 

did about
 
your c ous in Nina, I believe.  Can you tell us  that? 
 
> > Sylvia Rozines :  My cous in Nina is  alive.  She lives  in New Yor k.  We're the s am e age.  One time 

her  mother
 
--
 
they wer e taking the c hildren.  We never knew whic h s tr eets  they were going to bar ricade.  
So it happens they barr icade her s treet.  And they took  by force m y c ous in.  And the mother c am e to 

our  hous e s cr eaming:  They took  Nina.  Pleas e help me, help me.
 
 
So my father and her  father  and s om ebody els e, they us ed to put you in the hos pital and in 
the hos pital trucks c ame and took  you away to Germ any.  They got out.  They made believe they wer e 

c him ney s weeper s .  She was  ver y
 
--
 
I was  a tall girl for my age.  She was  tiny.  And they got her  out to 
the c himney.  They brought her back.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  They took  a wheel barr el in, c over ed with bags .
 
> > Sylvia Rozines :  Like they're c leaning.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  They hid her in the wheel barr el and then pulled her out.
 
> > Sylvia Ro
zines :  But in 
`
44, her par ents, they had enough.  They thought it was  better .  They left in 
`
44.  The reas on s he s urvived
 
--
 
s he was  luc ky
.  S
he never went to Aus c hwitz.  They put her with 
gyps ies .  And gyps ies  wer e allowed to keep one c hild.  So her  m other c ould take her .  And the father 
went s omeplace els e.  And after the war , the father  c ame
, 
the firs t one bac k
,  
and stayed with us .  We 
were in the c ity, at that time had a large apartm ent.  And then he hear d the wife is  alive.  So they got 
r eunited. 
 
>> 
Bill Bens on:  So when you were going to be sent on the trains  to Aus chwitz not knowing where you 
were going, your father m ade that dec is ion I'm  not going and in the c haos  he s ort of s lipped you all in to 
be part of the c leanup c rew.  And then you went to t
he
 
--
 
> > Sylvia Rozines :  The Germ ans, we had a J ewis h leader.  They told us, you go to this  fac tory.  I don't 
know how he hid m e and we got into the bas em ent and the other c hildr en.  Mus t be at
 
--
 
at night and 
took thos e c hildren.  And the next morning they went to work with hors e and buggies .  And ther e was  

an elec tric c ar.  They loaded up their  belongings  and went to the train station and everything went to 
Germ any.  
 
 
But s ometim es  in the hous es  they found s ome food.  It was  sum mer  tim e, I r emember .  
Bec aus e the windows  wer e open.  And when you walked through the s tr eet, you c ould s ee paper s 
flying, like a ghos t town.  They wer e going hous e
-
to
-
hous e and c leaning up.  And s ometimes  we found 
the 
yards  with still the vegetables .  So the last year we were not as hungry bec aus e we were 800 
people.  And ever ything was  left over , the flour.  So we c ould br ing it to the c amp.  Ther e was  a c amp.  
There was  a kitc hen.  The wom en c ooked.  So that was  not as  bad with the hunger but we wer e s till 
afraid what the Germ an are going to do with us . 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  As you say, a ghost town.  This  is a plac e where at fir st 160,000 people wer e there and 

now ther e's 800
 a
dults  and 11, 12 c hildr en hidden in the bas ement of the one of the buildings  where 
thos e 800 people wer e
.  What c an you tell 
us  about 
what it was  like for you for  m onths to be down in 
the bas ement of this  building with 11 other c hildr en? 
 
> > Sylvia Rozines :  I don't r em em ber  how long I was  there but it was n't a long tim e.  The Ger man c am e 

and found us .  They
 
went down and took all the childr en. We mar c hed to the hous e with the Ger mans  

8 
 
wher e the Germ ans  s tayed in a s pec ial hous e.  It was  c alled the r ed hous e.  The par ents were 
devas tated. What ar e they going to do with thos e 12 childr en? 
 
 
I c ouldn't underst and Germ an at that tim e.  I heard them talking and talking.  I had my little 
c ous in Is aac who lives  now in Canada and his  mom  s aid he s hould lis ten to m e.  He was  r eally
 
a good 
boy and s tayed.  He would
 
hold m y hand.  And finally they allow us  
to 
go bac k . 
 
 
My father k new the c ity so well.  So he us ed to go thr ough the backyards bec aus e it was  
winter and lots  of s now
, g
o through the backyar d to s ee what the Germ ans  ar e going do with us .  When 
he s aw us  c om ing out fr om  that hous e, he knew we ar e c om ing back 
to the c amp.
 
 
The reas on we found out why the Germ an did this, ther e wer e not too m any German in that 
house.  But many people ask m e:  Why didn't you go?  Young men, kill thos e Germ an?  They had a 

telephone.  And ever y day they were getting
 
--
 
or maybe twi
c e a day
 
--
 
c alls  from Germ any if ever ything 
is  ok.  If we would kill them , hundr eds and hundreds  of Germ an would arr ive killing us.  
 
 
But that's  what they had the s ame plan.
  
They made the m en dig three large holes  in the 
c em eter y.  The men c ame hom e.  T
hey knew it was  for  us.  You c ould hear  already bom bs  falling far 
away.  I c ould s ee little tiny planes .  They wer e ver y high.  
They 
knew the war  was  almos t over .  So 
they dec ided to kill ever y body.  That's why they didn't kill the 12 c hildr en.  They knew in a few m onths  
they wer e going to kill ever yone. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  I want to take you back just a little bit. When the Ger mans  found you in the c ellar after  
you had been hiding there, that mus t have been terr ifying for you.
 
> > Sylvia Rozines :  It was .
 
>>
 
Bill Benson:  They pulled you
 
--
 
you wr ote about they pulled you by your hair and pulled you up.  If I 
r em em ber right, the 800 adults  stepped up and sur rounded thes e few Germ ans .  You des cr ibed that in 

your  book .  They m ade it c lear  that they c ould not take the kids .  And bec ause ther e wer e s o few 

Germ an s oldier s , they left at that point.
 
> > Sylvia Rozines :  Yes .  Ther e was  ver y few s oldiers  there.  They had guns , of c ours e.  When they 

dec ided to kill the 800 people, m any, many German arr ived, hundreds.  Bec aus e it was  the hous e and 
the hous e had
 
--
 
all of those c ars  ar rived. We k new to kill 800 people, you needed m any s oldier s . 
 
 
I'm c ontinuing.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Ok .
 
> > Sylvia Rozines :  The leader who was  J ewis h from  our  c amp, he opened the door.  He s ays ,
 
"T
omor row we'r e all going to get killed."  Just go wher ever you wanted to hide your s elf.
  
It was  J anuar y, 
very c old.  Gr oups for med.  Some per s ons  in a big bas em ent in this building.  Some groups formed on 
the left.  My father for  s ome r eas on was  the las t
 
one to leave.  He c ouldn't believe this  is  going to 
happen.  He made this  m an who wor ked the trolley go to the plac e where the Ger man is  to make 
believe he's  trying out, som ething m ec hanic al
 i
f they as k  him .  They didn't ask him .  But he s aw all the 
Germa
ns in the c ars .  That's the tim e he dec ided to go.
 
 
So all thos e people
 
--
 
he was  like a leader.  They s aid whatever you do, bec aus e they had 
their childr en, they follow.  And he dec ided to go to the hous e ac r os s where the Germ ans  were staying.  
He figur ed
 
by the tim e they go hous e
-
to
-
hous e, this  is  the las t hous e they will look.  And he could see 
what was  happening in that c our tyard wher e the Germ ans ar e
. W
e had the s hade.  He made a little 
hole and he watc hed. 
 
We s tayed there m aybe three nights.  We only
 
had bread. We c ouldn't mak e a 
fir e bec aus e they would s ee the sm oke.  But the bom bs  were falling now ver y c los e.  We were not 

afraid of the bombs.  We wanted it to bec aus e with knew then we would get liberated.
 
 
So the next day was  quiet.  No bom bs.  We s ee this  lady walking on the str eet.  Mos t of the 
people now in the apartment s aid let's  go out, we were liberated.  My father  was  s till s c ared.  He s aid 

m aybe they put it as  a dec oy.  Then we s aw other  people c om ing
. t
he Polis h people wer e br ought to 
the 
wir es .  They c ould c ut them.  The Germ an were gone.  They wanted the fur nitur e and the c lothes .  
We didn't have tim e to c lean up all of that. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So the Polis h c itizens , they wer e coming to get what was left in the ghetto now that the 
Germ ans
 
were gone.
 

9 
 
> > Sylvia Rozines :  And we c ame up fr om  the two camp buildings and just stood on the str eet to be 
happy that we are fr ee.  We saw the Polis h people c arr ying ever ything.  It never  oc c urr ed to us to go 
bac k  and get s ome.  I don't know, s om e m aybe
 
young m en went to the fac tor ies and br ought out coats  
bec aus e my mother wind up with a c oat to be warm .  And the r est, we were like in s hock .  But m any of 

the Rus s ia
 
--
 
they wer e colonels  and c aptains, c am e and told us  that we are the firs t J ewis h people 
being liber ated.  So everyone s tar ted to cr y. We thought we wer e the only ones .  We didn't know other  
c am ps in Germany.  They gave us  c hocolate, whatever they had for  the childr en.  He s ays
 
--
 
they wer e 
r eally, really nic e us .  They s aid you c an go and do
 
whatever  you want, on the other s ide.  But we wer e 
s till s c ar ed.
 
 
Should I s aid
 
--
 
at that tim e I only s poke Polis h.  I bec ame 10 year s old the day after  the 
liberation.  And when I was  s tanding ther e, I heard a voic e, a lady's  voic e, s aying aloud, "
L
ook 
how 
m any ar e s till left over ."  And that was  a s hock  to m e.  I thought they would be nic e.  Yeah.
 
I never forget bec aus e I can s till s ay it in Polis h. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Sylvia, as  you told us, you went bac k
 
--
 
when you did go bac k  to your  apartm ent, you 
fo
und that ever ything was  gone.
 
> > Sylvia Rozines :  Gone.
 
> > Bill Bens on: What was  left?
 
> > Sylvia Rozines :  Pic tures .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Tell us about the pictures.
 
> > Sylvia Rozines :  The pic tur es were laying on the floor.  We had large pic tur es with fr am es
 
but they 
took
 
--
 
bec aus e of the fr ames , they took the frame.  Ther e was  nothing left in that apartm ent.  But we 
did find the pic tur es.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Som e of them had footpr ints  on them?
 
> > Sylvia Rozines :  Yes .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And thos e inc lude the photogr aphs we s aw.  Right?
 
> > Sylvia Rozines :  Yes .  The ones when I'm young.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  That was  fr om then.
 
> > Sylvia Rozines :  I gave all my
 
--
 
Holoc aust mus eum would only ac c ept or iginal.  So I have a s on 
who is  very angry at me.  But I gave away t he or iginal.  They made m e beautiful c opies .
 
 
Bec aus e later on I was  thinking for the future.  My grandc hildren won't know s om e of the 
pic tures, the people.  They only would r ec ognize m aybe m y par ents .  They have nice c opies .  So I 

figured I wanted to do t
his .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Your parents  made the dec is ion to not s tay in Poland very long after the war .  Tell us  
how they got out of Poland.
 
> > Sylvia Rozines :  Then we got out of the c amp and we looked for an apar tm ent.  Fir st we went to an 

apar tm ent in the ghetto.  And then the Polis h people s tarted to s et fire.  When I s ay the Polis h people, 
that does n't m ean all the Polis h people.  There was  a c lan who formed and they did it.  So we dec ided 
to move out to the other  s ide of town. We found a nic e apartm ent wher e German us ed to live that was  

em pty.  You didn't need
 
--
 
they just told us
 
--
 
you know, there was  no law at that time m ade.  If you find 
an em pty apartment, you have the r ight to go in.  We wer e ther e.  My father started again his  bus ines s .  

And one Polish m an who he did bus ines s before the war  lent him s ome money to start.  And he did 
very well.  We had a r eally nic e life
, b
eautiful apartm ent
, f
urnitur e
, fo
od.
 
 
In the beginning, the money, ther e was  no money.  So we exc hanged
 
--
 
we went to the open 
m ar
ket. We gave s ome c lothes  and the Polis h people gave us food.  So food we had.  But it 
happened
 
--
 
I had a big pr oblem .  I c ouldn't eat that food.  I was n't us ed to it.  So m y m other did 
ever ything
 
--
 
whatever  I liked s he fixed
 
for m e but I c ouldn't eat. 
I
t took up m any year s .  Even in Fr anc e.  
I jus t c ouldn't eat c ertain foods .  It jus t didn't appeal to m e. 
 
 
Then we were doing well and it s tarted.  This  c lan went at night to the people and s tarted to 
take a little of their m oney, beat them  up.  Our  neighbor did it.  Then ther e was  a ver y famous  c ity.  

They went and killed all the s ur vivor s who lived there. 
 
So m y father dec ided it's tim e for us to leav e.  
We s urvived the war and now we get killed after the war?  
 

10
 
 
 
So we left at night.  We left all of our 
belongings which the German didn't take away.  There 
was  a beautiful table c loth s omeone did by hand.  I begged my m other.  I will hide it under my c oat.  We 
had to leave like going for  a walk.  Of c ours e no telev is ion.  So in the evening the people us ed t
o take 
walks .  It was  normal.  My m other put like two blous es .  Nobody c ould s ee.  We all went for a walk .  

And when it got dark , we went to the train s tation and left to near the border  of Germ any.  
 
 
And then I don't know how my father found s om eone.  He
 
was  trans porting gas oline.  He hid 
us  behind the gas oline.  We went to Germany, to Berlin.  That was  the fir s t dis plac ed c am p.  They gave 

us  the s hots  not to get s ic k .  That was  Americ an s ide.  The best c am ps wer e on the Am eric an s ide.  
They were ver y nic
e.
  
So we were as s igned a c am p and we s tayed ther e.  And food was  not a problem .  
There was  a kitc hen. Women wer e c ooking.  We had an elec tric little oven you c ould do in your room. 
 
We waited.  Whic h c ountr ies  would allow us
 
to
 
c ome?
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Your  father wanted to go to Pales tine.  Right?
 
> > Sylvia Rozines :  In the beginning, no c ountr y allow us  yet.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Right.
 
> > S ylvia Rozines :  So 
`
46, it was  Pales tine.  We c ouldn't go ther e.  My father got tir ed of waiting.  We 
found out my m other
 
had a brother  who lived there m any years  befor e the war in Paris , Fr anc e. We 
r ec eived a letter  for him to c om e.
  
Then we went als o thr ough the border.  Not legally.  There was  no 
pas s port at that time.  We arrived in Paris , France.  I finally was  able to
 
go to a regular  sc hool, at 12 
year s  old, and s tar t s c hooling.  And my mother language is  r eally Frenc h.  But Polis h, I kind of wanted 
to forget it, whic h I'm s orry now bec aus e I get people and I can only unders tand

> > Bill Bens on: Was that a har d tim e
? 

> > Sylvia Rozines :  The kids wer e s o good.  I was  the only c hild in that whole s c hool who was  not 
Fr ench.  They helped m e.  The teac hers  helped me.  It was  wonderful.  That tim e we wer e s tar ting to 

live a norm al life until 1951.  My mother  at 45 got c ancer .  I lost her.  I was  16. 
 
 
So my s is ter, who was  alr eady married.  She was  in Americ a.  She loved this  c ountr y.  She 
c am e to take c ar e of m e.  She took  me
:  C
om e to Amer ic a
; 
it's  s o muc h nicer.  My father decided we 
s hould be together.
  
Then in 1957, I 
em igr ate to Americ a.
 
> > Bill Bens on: With your father.
 
> > Sylvia Rozines :  With m y father .

> > Sylvia Rozines :  We're very c los e.  My father bec am e my m other and father.  So we did a lot in 
Fr anc e.  He loved to go to operas.  He did it in Poland, too.  So the two of us  us ed to go often.

all the memor ies  asking m e questions .  Later I dec ided I want
ed to do this  book  for m y grandc hildren.  I 
wouldn't be here but for  m y gr eat grandc hildren so they have the s tor y.
 
 
I have a gr anddaughter.  She didn't like me to talk  about it.  And s he c ouldn't r ead the book.  
She was  r ead
ing
 
it, she was 16.  I'm after 
her  now to read it again.  She's now gr own up in c ollege.
 
 
This  book  started the whole thing why I s tarted to s peak  to c hildren.  I thought I had nothing to 
s ay bec aus e s ome of m y fr iends  had hor rible stories .  They wer e in c onc entr ation c amps . When they 

told m e my s tor ies
 
--
 
I had Am eric an fr iends , c ouples , and Holoc aust sur viv or s
 a
nd two of them  told m e 
they wer e in c onc entration c am ps .  I didn't talk about m e bec aus e what they went through, c ompared, I 

had m y par ents to take car e of me.  That's  why I was  able to s urvive.  Wouldn't be my father , of c our s e 

I wouldn't be here.  They never s eparated the mother  fr om the child.  You go right or left.  So m y s ister 
m aybe.  But s he was  young.  But this  is our destiny, I gues s .  It happened, a m irac le, he dec ided
 
to put 
thos e childr en in the basement.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Should we turn to our audienc e and s ee if they have a few ques tions  for you? We'll do 
that a little bit later.

We have micr ophones  on both s ides  of the ais le.  We ask that if you have a ques tion, 
wait 
until you get the mic .  Try to mak e your ques tion as  br ief as you c an.  I'll repeat it s o ever ybody in the 
r oom hears it, inc luding Sylv ia.  And then s he'll res pond to your question. 
 
 
Who has a ques tion they would like to ask Sylvia?  Do we have any brave s ouls  to s tart us off 
her e? 
 
 
A hand up back there, I believe.  I think  the m ic  is  c oming your way.
 
>> 
Yes.  Thank  you s o muc h for  s har ing your story with us  today.  I have a ques tion about just after 
Lodz was  liber ated in 1945, and als o in Germ any at the dis plac ed pers ons c am ps, what was  it like 
m eeting mor e c hildren, som e of whom had differ ent kinds of experienc es , s peaking Rus s ian, Polish, 
Yiddis h?  How did
 
you
 
interact with thes e other childr en and tell the s tor ies ? What was  that like?
 
> > Bill B e
ns on:  After  the liberation.
 
> > Sylvia Rozines :  In DP c amp.  After DP c am p, s ome c hildren c am e from  Rus s ia.  The parents wer e 

s ent ther e.  They als o s poke Rus s ian.  But m os tly I tr ied to have
 
--
 
talk  to the ones  who s poke Polis h.  
And like Hungar ian, we couldn't c omm unic ate.  So gr oups form ed, you know, who
 
c ould s peak  the 
s am e language.
 
 
In DP c amp, we were not afraid at all. We felt fr ee.  We wer e not afraid the Ger man ar e going 
to c om e and hur t us .  No.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Thank  you, Sylvia.  Thank s  for the ques tion.  I think ther e's  another  hand back  there 
and one over  here, too. 
 
>> 
I just wanted to ask you your  mos t fearful m oment dur ing your c hildhood. 
 
> > Bill Bens on: What was  your  m os t beautiful mom ent
 
--
 
> > Sylvia Rozines :  No, fearful.
 
> > B ill Ben
s on:  Fearful.  I'm s orry. 
 
> > Sylvia Rozines :  The fearful moment was  being bur ied in the c em eter y.  And s inc e then, after the 
c em eter y, I was  always
 a 
s c ar ed c hild.  I was  s car ed even when I was  growing up
, y
ou know, like being 
by mys elf in the hous e.
  
W
hen I los t my hus band, I didn't r ealize that I was  s till this sc ar ed little girl.  I 
had to have a night light.  I lived in a hous e and I was  not c omfortable.  And I s aid
:  W
hat c an happen?  
The Germ ans  ar e not here.
 
 
But after the war , when we lived in an
 
apar tm ent, I was  always  s c ar ed at night they ar e going 
to c om e.  Ther e was  no German there.  But at night there were s hadows  from  the street lights , went 
thr ough the c urtain.  I imagined a German is  s tanding.  I had a tough time with this .  I was  very bas
hful.  
I c ouldn't talk to s tr angers .  Now I'm  jus t the oppos ite.

When you were liber ated and you wer e in these c amps , when you heard about Aus c hwitz for the 
fir s t tim e and the c onc entration c amps

you had no idea.
 
> > Sylvia Rozines :  No.

I remember it was 
a Sunday.  He arr ived.  He s till wor e the s tr iped
 
s uit.  And another, and they s tar ted to tell us  the s tory.  
So our s tory, we didn't say anything c om par ed how they s uffer ed.  It was  ter rible.  It was  in s hock , we 

were. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Sylvia, y ou told us that your  c ous in Nina s urvived.

How was  it when you went to Ber lin?  How did the Germans tr eat you? 
 
> > Bill Bens on: When you went to Berlin, what was  it like?  How did the Germ ans tr eat you in Berlin?
 
> > Sylvia Rozines :  When we went to Berlin, right away we went to the c am p whic h was  Americ an.  Oh, 
the German wer e afr aid.  They wer e afra
id to do anything.  They didn't have the food.  So the German 
had nothing to do with us.  There was  Am er ic an soldier s .  If anything happened, ther e wer e MP ar ound.  
No, they were too afraid.  Plus  they were mostly wom en and c hildren.  Their s oldiers  got ki
lled, too.  
They were afr aid.  Bec aus e they knew what was  happening.  Bec aus e s ome of the c onc entr ation 
c am ps were ver y near.  They jus t ignored it.  So they knew they were guilty. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And a ques tion
 
--
 
> > Sylvia Rozines :  They wanted just if
 
they c ould get s ome food.  Ther e was  a dr es s maker .  My

no m oney.  
And we bought the m ater ial and s he made dr esses .  No, we wer e not afr aid they will hurt us.  Am er ic an 

s
oldier s  were all ar ound.  I never heard anyone being hurt, you know.

 i
n Albany, New York .  And then he lived by 
him s elf.  And m y s is ter  was  there. We wer e vis iting very often.  He pas s ed away at 77.  It's too bad he

> > Sylvia Rozines :  He was  a terr ific  pers on to help.  He had lots  of c our age.  He was  very s trong.  He 
was  lifting up.  That's  why he was  c hos en to do this  job, 100
 
kilos  of flour  on his  s houlder.  That's why 
he delivered. 
 
It was  hor se and c arr iage.  He went from the bakery to the baker y.  But having this job 
helped us  not to be as  hungry as  the other people. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  I'm going to turn back  to Sylvia to c los e our pr ogram  in jus t a moment.  I want to thank
