[DL] Okay. So Ron, when were you born?

th
  1917 
[DL] And whereabouts  were you born? 

[RJ] Here in Bassaleg. 

[DL] Okay. And what was 
your family background?

[RJ] My father was a blacksmith. An i
ndustrial blacksmith. My mother, mother, 
was a tailor. 
[DL] And in terms of your
 schooling and your background? 
 

[RJ] I went to the local school, then I w
on a scholarship  and went to the grammar 
school.  

[DL] And from ther
e, what did you do? 

[RJ] When I was fourteen, 
my father was trades, all he believed in was trades 

and he wouldn™t let me stop there so they
 got me out at 14 and they appren ticed 
me to the local firm Geskin 
and Nettleford as a wire draw
er. I learnt my trade as 
wire drawer. 

[DL] And when the outbreak
 of war actually  happe
ned when you were twenty 
two, whereabouts were you and what happened to you from there?  

[RJ] I worked in Cardiff, Eastmoor , Card
iff, GKN, Geskin and Nettlefold and, er, I 
got called up in Sept
ember 1940, which was rather
 a mistake because I had a 
reserved occupation Œ er, cut a  long stor
y shot, it was, I had my call up papers 
but erm when I went down to wor k to see about it they discovered that my form 

that I had filled in to sa y that I had a rese
rved occupation  was some typist put it in 
the incoming mail ins t ead of the outgoing ma
il, no record of me at the labour 
exchange - so I got called up. So I went
 to the Brecon to the South Wales  
borders and I was  there for about two months 
and I got called in t o the CO as my 

firm had err tried to get me back  naturally. 
Oh he said, you™ll hav e to serve t hree 
months proficiency pay first. I said, yes,
 okay. So anot her couple of months went  

by and I got another call to go in t
here and his argument then was oh it™s 
changed he said you™ll have to s erve six 
m onths proficiency and then we™ll see 
about it. It was pretty obvious to me that 
he wasn™t going to let m e go so, so, in 
the meantime, they offered 
me to let me go to a CADRE course and I thought it 
was a bit more money and s o I t ook it. I had another r equest from the firm to get  

me back. And he s aid,  ﬁOh my God,ﬂ he said
, ﬁNCOs I couldn™t 
let you go. On no 
account.ﬂ And within six 
months I was out abroad. 
[DL] So, where did they send you first?

[RJ] They sent me out to Cairo. To the 
Citadel in Cairo. To make up a battalio n of 
the First battalion Welsh Regiment t
hat got knocked ab
out in Crete. 
[DL] And briefly describe your time inNorth Africa leading up to your capture? 
[RJ] I was in Cairo for about
 four or five weeks  
[00:05:00] 
[RJ] and then they s ent us what they
 called ﬁthe blueﬂ up the desert and we 
fought our way up to Bengh
azi and we got up to Beng
hazi by  Chr istmas, had my 
Christmas dinner there and 
t hen in January, forty five
1
, the Russians, the 
Germans came out there and Rommel circ
led our camp at Be
ngha zi and caught  
the lot of us, the whole end block .  
[DL] And how where you captured? 

[RJ] Er, Sgt Major Convill 
said to me Corporal Jones Go up the road and take a 
section up the road and see 
what is going on.
 (Laughs). I hadn™t gone 100 y ards 
up the road and there was  a dirty great 
tiger tank coming do
wn the road with a 
big swastik a on the side, a big black cr
oss and there was err a fellow, I presume 
a German officer, sticked up in t he turret 
there and in perfect E
nglish he said to 
me, ﬁCome on boys drop your weapons, for 
you the war is over.ﬂ So I wa s a 
prisoner of war. 
[DL] So when you were captured where wer e you sent? 
[RJ] We taken up to T r ipoli 
and we were put in empty little cargo boats that were 
going out to Naples with equipm ent for the 
Germans so I arrived in, I forget what 
the date was, it was  about t
he end of F ebruary when I got
 out to Naples and the 
Italians took us down to Camp 065 in the 
heel of Italy in Brindis i  err and I was 
there for about, oh, going on for nine 
months and then one day they got us  

together and put us on a train and took us
 up to a place I think it was called 
Tarona just outside Rome 

[DL] And when was this? 

[RJ] This was something like July , August 43. And then one day, the interpreter 

came round and he asked for anybody with
 engineering experience and , of  
course, a couple of hundred of us stuck 
our hands up. We wanted to know what

for. He said, ﬁOh,ﬂ he said, ﬁwe are short 
of labour in the car factories in Milan,ﬂ 
and we thought, ﬁOh that™s a good thing 
t o get out anywayﬂ - cause nobody 
worked in Italy mind, so, anyway we go
t on this train now and we trav elled 
overnight and we pulled up in this station 
in the morning thinking it was Milan and 
we heard ﬁ
Rous! Rous
!ﬂ outside and one of the boys said, ﬁHey, that™s German!ﬂ 
It was the Brenner Pass and they were h
anding us over to the Germans. The 
Germans then stuck us in cattle trucks, fort
y in a truck, and took me then I was in 
the truck for two days, no food, and we
 all had the runs, just imagine how 
humiliating it is in those trucks with no 
toilets nothing and we used one of the 
corners as a toilet. We go to, I think Stal
ag IVB at Moosburg, I think it was,  and 
there they got us out they gave us some  food and by this time, don™t forget, we 
are covered in lice. So they took  all of ou
r uniforms and put it in
 whatever it did, 
cleaned them up and gave it to us back 
whilst we were naked they took us 
through a place where they ha
d like sheep shear
ers and they took all our hair  off, 
everywher e, up, down below, up on the t
op, everywhere,  and t hen they dabbed 

us with what I called was a buck et of creosote, and disinfectant anyway they put 

us back on the train now and we were 
on t he train again for about another two 
days and eventually pulled up in
 a station called Lansdorf, Poland. Err, it was  
Stalag V111B 
[DL] And when, when did you arrive at Stalag VIIIB? 

[RJ] Stalag VIIIB? It was 
in err, I think it was 
around about the beginning of 
September 43. 

[DL] So when were you captured in North Africa? 

[RJ] I was captured in 
North Africa on the second week in January 45 
[00:10:00] 
[DL] Sorry, forty? When youwere captured, was it 1943? 
[RJ] No, fort y two. 

[DL] Forty two. So, you were captur
ed in 1942 and then ended you up at Stalag 
VIIIB. 

[RJ] I ended up in Italy first and then Stalag
 VIIIB was close on I think it was, 
about, the end of, round about the 
beginning of September 43.

[DL] Fine. So at this point you had s
pent close on 18 months in captivity. 
[RJ] In Italy, in Italy, it
 was a problem. If it hadn™t 
been f or the Red Cross parcels  
then I don™t think we would hav e survived.  A
ll they  gave us was a little loaf of 
bread. We used to call it a Piccolo Parnie
. A bit of cheese and stuff like that. And 
then every day we us ed to get what we ca
lled potato s oup, a la
dle of soup, that 
was all we had. If it hadn™t have been for 
the Red Cross  parcels then I don™t think  
we wou ld h ave survived.  

[DL] In terms of what cond
itions were like at Stalag
 VIIIB, how did the Germans 
treat you and how long were you there for? 

[RJ] Well, the Germans didn™t bother us but
 the British had a bit of a err a centre, 
like a medical centre, they took all of our
 clothes and of  course
 by then there was  
a blue diamond on the back of y our coat an
d your trousers to say that you was a 
prisoner of war. Err, they
 sorted us out. By this time I had a beard and they 
sorted us out but, in Germany, everybody
 below the rank of
 Sergeant worked. 
There was about, as far as I know, 130,000 
Prisoners of War, of all n ationalities 
in Poland. They work ed on farms, err, one ma
te of mine, Trevor Manly, lived up 
the road here, he worked in a coal mine, 
err, railways , err, then eventually, they 
picked out  280 of us and sent us out to 
work at IG Farben chemical industry. 
That™s all we knew. 

[DL] And, the British were effectively organizing themselves at Stalag VIIIB? 

[RJ] Yeah, yeah, yeah.  

[DL] So– 

[RJ] The guards didn™t interfer
e with us they effectively just patrolled the grounds.  
[DL] So how did you go from Stalag VIIIB to– 

[RJ] They took us on an ordi
nary  civilian train, err, and 
(phone rings)
 we were  on  
the train for several hours and then we pul led up in the station and we marched 

down to our camp. On the way down, we 
s aw all this high b arbe d wire a nd men  
in pyjamas digging trenches. Now, don™t forget
 this is October and it™s pretty cold 
in Poland in October so I said to one of  the guards, ﬁWho are 
they?ﬂ And he said,  

ﬁJuden!ﬂ I said, ﬁPardon?ﬂ And he said, just 
how I™ll say  it, ﬁJew
s!ﬂ Like as though 
we should have known. It took us a c ouple of days to rea
lize that it was

Auschwitz. We didn™t k now what Auschwitz 
was in thos e days but it didn™t take us 
long to find out what wa
s going on. We went down 
to the works and found out. 
The first thing we notic ed was a terrible smell and the Jews in the works told us it  
was the crematorium. We didn™t know what
 they were talking about to start with 
but after a while we realized what  was going on. 

[DL] When you got to Auschwitz, y
our first POW camp there:E711. 
[RJ] Yes, yes, they took us into a camp
 called E711. It was pretty primitive. The 
toilets, for instance, were just a hole in
 the floor over a cesspool and we were 
there for two to three wee
ks and then they s ent us ov
er to E715 which I presume 
was a, a c amp built f or the Hitler Youth.
 There, of course, the facilities were 
totally different, we even had showers and flushed toilets and a place where you 

could do a bit of cooking.  

[DL] And the actual location of your fi
rst camp, E711, compared to Monowitz.  

Whereabouts would you say? 

[RJ] I think. We didn™t march there. We ju
st sort of strolled ov
er to the new place 
so I should imagine that it was attached to 
it but I am not quite certain of that. 
[00:15:00] 
[DL] But within the co
mpound of  Auschwitz  itself 
(Ron: yeah)
, within the actua l  
wired facility 
(Ron: yeah)
 that was Auschwitz 
(Ron: yeah)
? 
[RJ] I would think  we were about two to
 two and a half  kilometers from Birkenau 
which was the death camp.  
[DL] And whereabouts  was E715 Auschwitz? 

[RJ] It used to take us about 10 minutes, quarter of an hour to march there so it 

must have been quite close to IG Farben. 

[DL] And, what was t
he average day like for yourselves? In terms of– 
[RJ] We got up at half past five with a cup 
of Ersatz coffee, bur
nt acorns as they 
called it. (Laughs) Er, that™s all we had then,
 then we, oh, they used to give us a 
piece of br ead, with, we us ed to have cut 
up a loaf of bread whic h we  would cut  
up between eighteen of us, just one thick 
slice. And t hen we us ed to get, what  
they called a piece of chees
e, it was lik e a round, err,
 how could you call a round 
pasty of cheese? You could s ee fish scales 
in it an d it stunk 
like all the heaven.

But when you™re hungry then, believ e me, 
you™ll eat anything. Er r, and then we 
had sometimes a bit of, sometimes, a bit of
 jam to go on your bread. That was  
the rations you had then you marched to 
work, you got into, marched about six 
o™clock, then you got into works about t
en to quarter past six and then they used 
to hand us  over to the civilians. There we
r e nine of us in
 a little gang and they  
they, they handed us  over to a fellow 
called Master Beaver. He was a a a 
German civilian. In fairness, he was pretty fa
ir to us.  He™d say like, I want this, 
we were, we were constructing, err, 
I worked on a place, there was synthetic 
petrol, when I got there it was only just 
being built. They had, what they called,  
the Germans called ﬁkramersﬂ
2
 Œ it was like, erm, an 
ir on pipe about sixty feet 
high. Ther e were three of them there and 
they were full of clay filters and the 
petrol used to go in through 
the top and down th
rough the filters but we used t o  
move err machinery and rails a
nd, fair play for Beav er, he used to say ﬁGet this 

done, get t hat done and you can go back to
 the camp.ﬂ So, occas i onally, inst ead 
of going back to the camp at six o™c lock,
 we went back at th
ree o™clock in the 
afternoon. When we had completed what he wanted us to do. 

[DL] And what did you actually witness 
when you were at IG Farben when y ou 

were working in there with the slave l
aborers  around you? How we
re they treated 
and what did you witness when you were there? 

[RJ] Well, we sa w, all these Je ws wo
rking there and they used to be d i gging 
trenches and laying cables and all what we
 would used to call the menial tasks. 
You know. Err, to give you an idea, one 
of them, I had some, we had some food 

parcels in, so we didn™t eat the German ra
tions so I had a piece of sausage and I 
took it down to the works one day and I gav
e it to one of thes
e Jews and he said 
his name was Josef, a couple of days after he gave me that ring
3
, he said he 
made it out of a steel pipe. I stuck it on 
my finger and t here it™s been ever since. 
About a week after that, he disappeared, so I said to one of his mates, ﬁWhere™s  

Josef this morning?ﬂ and he said ﬁOh, gas chamber. Kaput.ﬂ That™s just what he 

said. The life of the Jews in the camp, 
they were in such a state, they were

shambling about, bent  up, couldn
™t stand up straight and 
there lives at the works 
was about  a month and when they couldn™t 
work they stuck them in a trolley  
(interrupts himself to correct)
 in a lorry and took them to the death camp to the 
gas chamber. So the fellow 
who made that ring for me went to the gas chamber. 
[DL] Did you see any high ranking SS officials? 
[RJ] Er, yes, we used to watch Kramer
, I presume it was Kramer, someone said 
his name was Kramer. He™d been walk
ing around the works with  a gang ar ound 
him. Fortunately, unfortunat
ely, if a Jew got in his way then he™s just kick them  
out of his way and twice I™d saw him act
ually take his Luger out and shoot two of 
them. Different times. I™d actually
 seen him shoot a couple of Jews. 
[00:20:00] 
[DL] When you saw that, w
hat was your reaction? 
[RJ] Oh, crikey. Disgusted. 
It, it, it, if it had been in 
civilian life we
 would have 
mobbed him but what can you do against Germans that were armed? We, we, 
cat called, we shouted but he didn™t take any notice of us. 

[DL] How were you treated? How 
were the British POWs treated? 
[RJ] In fairness, the Jews 
(corrects himself )  
the Germans treated us alright. We 
never had really any problem s. Ther
e was only one inc ident. These iron 
cylinders, the Germans used to c all them ﬁkramers.ﬂ

 One day me a nd Rey nolds,  
err, Corporal Reynolds, was err, ask
ed to go up and change over  the pipes at the 
top because they occasionally flushed t hem, clean them out but Reynolds not  

able to speak enough German tried to exp lain that he did not have enough 

clothes or the right clothes. He said he was a bit hairy of heigh
ts, that he™d fall off, 
he kept on arguing and old Beever then s ent
 for a guard. Unfo
rtunately, it was, 
err, I don™t know his name 
but he was an Under Officer,
5
 like a Sergeant t o us,  
three stripes. An argument, and he ast
onis hed me, he pulled his Luger out and 
he threatened Reynolds and Reynolds says I 
can™t go up there 
and he shoot him. 
You should have seen me go up there.
 I went up t here lik e a monkey. 
(Slig ht  
quiet laugh)

[DL] What was your reac
tion when, when you saw? 
[RJ] Oh, terrible. We all got together
. A crowd of us got together and 
remonstrated but when we got  to ca
mp that night that Under  Officer
6
 had 
disappeared. When we enquir
ed what had happene
d to him because we want ed 
the Red Cross to come there they said
 they™d sent him to the Russian Front. 
[DL] So you said that y
ou wanted the Red Cross to 
investigate the shooting? 
[RJ] We wanted the Red Cross to inv e
stigate it because,  let™s be f air, the 
Germans weren™t like that, they didn™t, they didn™t treat us bad at all.  
[DL] Because they treated the Jews badly.
  
[RJ] (
Jones does not hear and c
ontinues interview and ends  re ference to the 
Reynolds shooting by saying: 
That was just a one off).  
[DL] In terms of an actual
 war crime against the Britis
h POWs, as far as you™re 

aware, that was the only war crime which took place? 

[RJ] That was the only war cr
ime which I spied myself.  
[DL] Okay. What was your 
initial impress i ons during your first few week s at 
Auschwitz? 

[RJ] We couldn™t get over
 this smell and,  and, and th
ey were burning fellows, 
they were burning the Jews. It was astonish
ing. We just couldn
™t believe it but, 
eventually, we k new it was right.  That™s 
what was h appening. It shook us  rigid. 
We just didn™t know. We just couldn™t understand it. 

[DL] In terms of the cremat
oria, how did you know, what? 
[RJ] Occasionally, we would s ee smoke 
coming up a nd we™d say to ourselves  
that™s some more poor bugger
s burnt to death again.  

[DL] Were you scared 
of the crematoria? 
[RJ] Of course we were. We thought if ever
 they got desperate 
then they™d put us  
in there.  

[DL] So that was a very genuine c oncern? 

[RJ] That was a genuine scare. Yeah. 

[DL] Even though the Genev
a Convention supposedly–  

[RJ] Even though, there 
was always that danger.

[DL] Okay. How did t he British POWs c
ope, how did you cope,
 knowing that the 
gas chambers were, were on site 
and what was happening to the Jews. 
[RJ] Well, well, we just carried on worki
ng and I, I just can™t remember. We wer e  
alright. Prisoner of war life wasn™t all that
 bad. Err, we suffer
ed malnutrition. To 
give you an idea we suffered with our 
teeth. Used to chip and enamel would 
come off with malnutrition. Err, and e
rr, once every week on a Wednesday, a 
guard was allowed to take three or 
four of us err up into Caravichi
7
 to a Po lish  
dentist. (
Laughs
) Laughable as I was on this and 
W ally Martin and two fellows  
went up to this Polish dentist one day
, and the guard knocked on the door and 
the dentist  came to the door but ther
e was two Ge rman soldiers sat ins ide 
waiting their turn and, of 
course, immediately  they ju
mped up, clicked their heels 
and ﬁ
Heil Hitler!
ﬂ  
[00:25:00] 
[RJ] and Wally Martin, as quick as a flash, said ﬁ
Larry Adler!
ﬂ so that became our 
signature tune. Ask John Bishop 
(corrects himself)
 or Brian Bishop, I™d expect 
he™ll remember.  
[DL] Did you take part on any acts 
of sabotage that t
he British undertook? 
[RJ] The only acts of sabotage t hat I 
did, when we us e to go up to on the top 
(of 
the chimneys)
 to change these,  we us e to take a handful of s and and put a 
handful of sand, that was t
he only sabotage that I could 
get too. But I heard some 
of the boys when they  were 
building things they used t o
 disturb it and create all 
sorts but that™s the only kind of
 sabotage that I was involved in. 
[DL] So, how did that work? 

[RJ] We used to put a handful of sand when we were changing the pipes over. 

We™d stick a handful of sand in there. 

[DL] So, the pipes would becom e blocked? 

[RJ] Well, I presume that t
he synthetic petrol wo
uld wash it down 
into the others, 
so– 

[DL] And did you find that your fellow POWs
 didn™t want you to become involv ed 
in acts of sabotage?

[RJ] No, because, we were all of us of 
the same opinion, I think. There was all 
sorts of sabotage that went on bec
ause they were still building it.  
[DL] And did you find that being 
married made a difference at all? 
[RJ] Yes, because I was married they didn
™t allow me to be a member of the 
escape committee. They wouldn™t allow 
it because I was a married man.  
[DL] We™v e already touched on Master 
Beaver who was  in
 charge of your 
working group you were in. How large wa
s the wor king group that you were 
actually in – 

[RJ] There were nine of us 
who worked for Master Beaver. 
[DL] And in terms of the actual work
 which you undertook apart from cleansing 
out the towers, what other types of work did you undertake? 

[RJ] Oh, we used to move machinery arou
nd. As a matter of fact, the nail on my  
left foot is like a great big claw bec
ause I dr opped a rail on it
 one day. We were 
moving rails for runners and things lik
e that, all sorts of machinery. 
[DL] And in terms of the British and their 
attitudes towards you for medical help in 
that sort of situation. What sort of 
medic al help was ther
e for you at E715 
Auschwitz? 

[RJ] All we had was a er, as far as I 
know, he was a South 
Afric an doctor and 
that™s all we had. I think he
 had a fellow that used to 
assist him but I™m not quite 
sure. 

[DL] And what were conditio ns like in your medical facility there? 

[RJ] Erm, well, to get a day off as, one th
ing, we were covered in boils, I us ed to 
get boils and carbunc les and ev en when
 I came home I had them. And when I 
say I had a boil every where, I mean every wher e. I us ed to get terrible carbuncles  

and boils, I presume it was ma
lnutrition. I don™t know.  

[DL] And the actual medical 
facilities on site at E715? 

[RJ] Oh, poor. Poor. They never had the 
equipment, they never
 had the drugs as 
far as I know. Don™t forget, we were a
ll reas onably fit men so I don™t suppose we 
needed that kind of thing. 

[DL] And in terms of your relationships 
with t he Jews, how did that  work? Did you 
build any type of relationship with them? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0709 
 
 
 
14
[RJ] No, you weren™t allowed. They had 
Capos with them so you had to wat ch if 
he turned his head and y
ou wanted to talk to a Jew, 
if a Capo saw it he™d go 
straight to the Jew and belt him with like a truncheon he used to carry. The 
Capos were as far as I know, they were
 Polish politic al prisoner s and they used 
to wear an arm band with Capo on it, always in char ge of the Jews. Why they 

treated the Jews like that, I don™t know
, but they were sods, the Capos. 
[DL] In terms of what the Br itish actually did to try to 
allev iate the suffering of the 
Jews, in terms of providing food or– 

[RJ] If we had any food cause when we h
ad Red Cr oss parcels in we wouldn™t 
eat the rubbish that the Germans gave us  s o
 we alway s  took it
 to work and gave 
it to the Jews when the Capo 
wasn™t looking of course.  
[DL] So, how would you give you™r e
 your food, this is the soup. 
[RJ] Yeah, yeah, just give it to a Jew. 
[00:30:00] 
[DL] And what difference di
d that make do you think? 
[RJ] Made us feel clever, made us f
eel good that we were doing something. 
[DL] And how did the Jews respond to it? 
[RJ] Of course, they used to be overwhel
med when you used to give them s ome 
food. Poor buggers were 
starving, of course. 
[DL] So, their condition. How would 
you des cribe their condition today? 
[RJ] Terrible. Terrible. One day, er, they
 didn™t bring the soup for us so someone 

gave us what the Jews ate and
 it was just plan c abbage wa
ter. That™s all it  was. 
Oh crikey, it was terrible. I™d take a mouthf
ul and spit it out. Terri
ble. So that™s  all 
the Jews lived on. 

[DL] And were the British able to 
pass cigarettes as well to the Jews? 
[RJ] Yes, if  it was  pos sible then we woul
d. I wrote ho me and told my wife once 
that, err, cigarettes was currency so I thin
k  she used to go to Sm iths in Newport  
and they had some s cheme where you paid 
your money and they sent us parcels  
of cigarettes so I had quite a few parcels 
of cigarettes. One day, of course we 
used to tak e cigarettes down to the works a
nd we used to barter for a bit of white 

bread and eggs and I  had half a dozen eggs
 one day, coming back to the camp 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0709 
 
 
 
15
and we us ed to walk into the camp like this, you know, and the guard™s run his  
hands down to see if there™s anything and,
 this one day, I™d done it before but the 
guard went right down and found the eggs  
and he said, ﬁOh, I am, mein libre
8
ﬂ 
and squas hed the eggs around t
he leg and then took me 
into the guard room and 
then shoved me into a, in a civilia n prison for three days. 

[DL] And was this prison on site in Auschwit z? 

[RJ] No, up in Auschwitz. 

[DL] No, sorry, up in Auschwitz? 

[RJ] No in  the civ ilia n part of it. Up in
 the  town of A uschwitz, it  wasn ™t ca lled  

Auschwitz, we called it Au
schwitz but I think was– 
[DL] Oswiecim? 

[RJ]. Oswiecim. Somethi
ng like that it was. 
[DL] So it was actually in Oswiecim . 

[RJ] In the village, yeah. It wa
s just a police place, you know. 
[DL] And what were facilities like in the cell there? 

[RJ] Bread and water, 
(laughs)
 that™s all I had for three days.  
[DL] When you were back at E715 Ausch
witz, did you witness atrocities 
happening around your 
POW huts there? 
[RJ] There were no atrocities
 in our camp there, no. 
[DL] But, in terms of the Germans, bri
nging people,  you talk
 about, the Britis h 
cesspool being pumped out on one occasion and then the following day– 
[RJ] Oh that, yes, yes, they brought, they
 used to bring a a  a h orse and c art in 
those days  of course and then
 they™d br ing in tanks and pump out the sewers t o  
empty them and one day, they went out in
 the fields  opposite 
with these c arts, 
knock the bung out t he back and walk  bac k 
and forth dropping all our muck in a 
field. And a couple of days 
after, a lorry pulled up, wit
h, I presume, Jewesses  on,  
and they lik e had a bag around
 their waist full of pot
atoes and a little mattock and 
bear feet and they walked through dropping
 a potato in it and of course, they 
were women, and we were all eyes naturally 
(laughs).
 What a disgusting thing,  
couldn™t believe it.

[DL] And how did the POWs, how did yourself react? 
[RJ] Well, we were c r owding round and s houting and cat calling and booing.  

(laughs)
 I think the woman in charge of them
 was Irma Grese but I™m not quite 
sure. Someone said, ﬁThat™s Irma Greseﬂ but
 I don™t know. I think after the war, I 
think they recogniz ed her from Nurem
berg and someone said when we had our 
reunion, ﬁHey, that was Irma Grese with those women.ﬂ I don™t know. 

[DL] And how did she treat
 the women who would–? 
[RJ] Well, whipping t hem, what do they ca
ll it? A leat her thing and she used to 

shout at them. Treat t
hem terrible. Terrible. 
[DL] What were the guards lik e? Both 
in terms of what you have just described 
there and also in terms of– 

[RJ] I would say that 90 per cent of the 
guards were all men with patches on their  
eyes and wounds on their arms– 

[DL] I™m sorry, these 
are the guards who were? 
[RJ] These were our guards– 

[DL] At E715? 

[RJ] I think 90 per cent of the guards t
hat we had had either 
been injured on the 
front or were too old 
to go to the front.  
[00:35:00] 
[DL] So these were t he guards  that were
 therefore in char
ge of yourselv es, 
were–. 
[RJ] In charge of us, yes.  

[DL] Were members (Ron: yeah) of t
he German Army effectively (Ron: yeah)  
who were too poorly to fight– 

[RJ] The verntabel
9
 who was in charge of course wa s a normal verntabel
10
 he 
wasn™t injured but occ asionally we used to
 get the Gestapo who would c ome into 
the camp and search because to start wit
h they knew we had a wireless and to 
search for the wireless  and if they  knew 
we had cigarettes then they™d pinch them

but we used to shove them in all sorts of
 places we used to hide everything more 
often than not we knew they were there 
[DL] Were they Gestapo or SS? 

[RJ] I wouldn™t know, we used to call t
hem Gestapo but I they did have SS on 

their collars . I presumed they were all one in the same. 

[DL] How did you know when the SS came into your camp? 

[RJ] Oh, there was, a car, posh car pull 
up with four or five men, so you knew:  
Watch out! Gestapo about! 

[DL] And how did the guards change in their  behaviour ? 

[RJ] Oh, crikey. They  were frightened to 
death of them (laughs) so they were a 
bit keen at that particular time and once 
the Gestapo, of course, had gone they™d 

relaxed again. 

[DL] And these were y our guards, member
s of the German army who were too ill 
to fight? 

[RJ] In fairness, in fairness, we got fr
iendly  with a couple of guards. They they 
they didn™t they didn™t want war no more than we did.  

[DL] And in terms of what you wit ness
ed wit h the SS guards
, erm, at IG Farben 
and in Aus chwitz itself. What were they like? 
[RJ] Oh, the SS. Terribl
e. Strict. Military.  
[DL] And what did you see them do? 
[RJ] Er, they used to walk  around t
he works and er, used to push the Jews out  
the way but apart from when Kr amer came
 round with half a doz en fellows with 
him there wasn™t that kind of problem as 
they were just build
ing anyway, a lot of  
the works had just bee
n reconstructed.  
[DL] You t alked about the wir
eless, how did that act
ually work? Where did you 
find a radio from? How did you get it into your camp? 

[RJ] I wasn™t involved but, er, evidently 
they  got a wireless down in the work s and 
they broke it up into lit tle 
parts and some fellows brought
 it back in. Don™t forget 
there were all sorts of technicians in t
he prisoner of war camp and they put it 
together. I believe that Coward, Charlie 
Coward, CMS Coward, used to hav e it 
inside a Red Cross parcel in the Red Cr
oss stores and he used to go in there 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0709

every night and get the latest news and th
en come round the camp and tell us 
what was going on so we knew 
exactly what was going on– 
[DL] And are– 

[RJ] We knew about the second front,we knew about the Russians coming in. 

[DL] And are you aware of
 any of the British POWs
 trying to then disseminate 
that information to the Jews? 

[RJ] Not as I know of. They might of but 
I I I the nine that I was involved in,  we 
didn™t see much of the Jews  
at all. T here was o
ne incident that I™d 
like to tell you 
about. Master Beaver came to me one day and he s ays er he used to call me 

Jonas, not Jones, Jonas you get er tins of 
meat he said  in your parcel don™t you? 
Bring one to work one day so I  took th
is tin of bully beef to the works and he 
borrowed s ome bikes and three of us and 
Beaver went done to his cottage and 
he made us a big stew.    

[DL] And the cottage was wit
hin the perimeter of–  
[RJ] It was within in 
the perimeter of the er
m–they encircled a villa ge 
[DL] So it was within the per
imeter of the Auschwitz camp 
[RJ] It was inside the perim
eter of the electric fence 

[DL] And how did Master Beaver who was 
a civilian engineer, 
from what you™re 
saying there he seems to have treated you quite reasonably  

[RJ] Yes he treated us very fair 

[DL] And how did he treat–. 

[RJ] We had no problem with him at all. 
The only inc ident we had and he wa s as 
shocked as  we were was when Reynolds got  shot.  

[DL] And how did Master 
Beaver treat the Jews? 
[RJ] I wouldn™t know, as far as I know I 
don™t think I see him in contact with any of 
the Jews.  

[DL] Did the Germans ever plant anyone in 
y our camp to effectively spy on you? 
[00:40:00] 
[RJ] Well there was a rumour which w
ent round the camp one 
day A fellow came 
in he said he had come from  Stalag VIIIB 
and, er, well there was a bit of a doubt, 
I don™t know why, but there was  a bit of 
a doubt about him. A
nd after a couple of  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0709

weeks, I heard that they killed himand dumped him in the cesspool whether 
that™s true or not I don™t know I wa
sn™t involv ed myself, I only heard it. 
[DL] The facilities at E715 Ausch witz, 
what were the facilities like there?  
[RJ] They were alright. We had proper to
ilets, we even had a proper shower. We 
used to walk across  and hav e a proper s
hower oc casionally.  We were pretty 
good there, it was alright. All the huts 
had, er, hot water pi
pes around them , it 
was a bit  cold at times but, er, don™t fo
rget that in wint
er out there the 
temperature used to drop down to sometimes around 15 below–  

[DL] There was also a library? 

[RJ] Yes, we also had a library there.
 Some of the boys 
built up a library. 
[DL] And you also ha d a mendin g facility for clothing?  

[RJ] Yeah, yeah. Another thing we di
d was on a Sunday afternoon, we™d play 

football and when the Red Cross used to co
me there occasionally  and inspect us 
all and found out that we used to play
 foot ball there on a S
unday afternoon. I  
don™t know where they got the ball from, I™
m not sure and we us ed to p lay on a 
Sunday  afternoon and there was  crowds Œ s o
me of the, er, slave labourers from 

the different camps used to come and watch us and gu ards used to watch us, er,  

but once the Red Cross found out we play
ed the next  thing was they brought us 
four lots of shirts Œ Englis h, Welsh, 
Scots and Irish and so we s orted ourselves  
out. There were elev en of us but we were
n™t all, er, er, Welsh. Do you want  to 
see a photograph? 

[DL] We™ll have a loo k  at t
he photograph at the end. So it
 wasn™t just guards, and  
other POWs and local townsfolk, ther
e were also concentration camp? 
[RJ] Well, of course, ot
her than our camp, there 
wasn™t guards  around other 
camps. 

[DL] No, but in terms of those who actually watched and spectators. 

[RJ] Yes, it was slave labour but some
 of them were Poles, Ukranians, there 
were all sor t s of different people. 

[DL] So, the Jews weren™t allowed to watch? 

[RJ] No, no. The Jews weren™t .  The Jews
 weren™t allowed to go outside their 
camp Œ only to go to work.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0709 
 
 
 
20
[DL] But some of the other slave labour
ers who were in a different category? 
[RJ] Yes, yes, sometimes on a lovely  
afternoon, they™d be
 a crowd around, 
cheering and shouting. 
[DL] So other slave labourers w
ho were in a different category– 
[RJ] And in different camps 

[DL] And in different camps were– 

[RJ] But they were free, you know, they
 used to walk up and down the road, you 
used to see gangs of  women, all sorts 
walking up the road, between us a nd IG 
Farben, the camp. 

[DL] And these football matches: how often did you play? 

[RJ] Sunday afternoons. That was the only ti
me we wer e allowed. I n the summer. 
We couldn™t play in the winter because it was too cold then. 

[DL] And how long would these matches actually last for? 

[RJ] Oh, we were out ther
e for a couple of hours.  
[DL] And how important were th
ese matches for British POWs? 
[RJ] Oh, terrific in import
ance (laughs) you used to get rivalry but it was all for 
basic fun. 

[DL] In terms of the 
(pause)
 atrocities that  were happening against the J ews, 
we™ve already touched on the food which yo u tried to supply to them. Were there 

any other ways in which the Br itish tri
ed to elevate t he suffering of the Jewis h 
people? 

[RJ] Not as I know of. We used to pass 
them food but there 
was nothing els e we 
could do.  

[DL] And, in terms of your own treatm
ent, you talked earlier of the Italian camps 
and h ow difficult facilit ies were fo r you ther
e  and  that at E715  
Aus chwitz: did you 
feel that facilities were 
better at E715 than in Italy? 
[RJ] Oh, definitely. Yes. Yes,  we were
 alright there just because we were 
prisoners of war, it didn™t make everyt
hing bad. We used to make the most of  
everything.  
[00:45:00] 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0709 
 
 
 
21
[RJ] We didn™t hav e t he food we wanted 
naturally but, er, other than that, we 
used to make packs  of cards out of cigarette packets Œ there was alway s  
something going on and then 
we had, we also had with
 us, Wally Martin, who 
was a small time producer 
with the BBC and he used to  put
 plays on at night time 

and the Germans always kept t
he front row for the Germans. 

[DL] You were in one of Wally Martin™s play s called Sweeney Todd. 

[RJ] Yes, yes, he put a play on called 
Sweeney Todd. I was the Police Sergeant. 
[DL] And you acted alongside Arthur Giffo
rd England who was in the same play.  
[RJ] Yes, yes. 

[DL] How long did the play last for,not just in terms of it s duration. 

[RJ] We used to put it on for about two to three nights.  

[DL] And how popular were these plays? 

[RJ] Oh, everybody used to go to watch the plays. I can™t– We had one hut 

which had a stage and the hut was full. Always. 

[DL] So, how many people would you say? 

[RJ] A hundred or more I™d 
expect. Sure to be.  
[DL] And what difference did t
hese plays make for yourselves? 
[RJ] Oh, it used to c r eate all s orts of 
exc itement. First of all t here were the 
rehearsals and then there was th
e wigs. We used to make wigs, erm, we took the 
string from the Red Cross par
cels and us ed to take us hours to thread it and 
make a wig, to make a brunette, we used t o
 dip the wig in inde
lible pencil in the 
bucket to make a black one (laughs).  

[DL] And when the Nazis came to wa
tch these plays in the front row– 
[RJ] It wasn™t Nazis that came in to wa
tch the plays, this wa
s the German guards.  
[DL] The German guards. 

[RJ] I wouldn™t call them Nazis.  

[DL] Why wouldn™t you call them Nazis? 

[RJ] I don™t think they, the only people we
 called Nazis  were the Gestapo and the 
officials. 

[DL] So, in other words,
 members of the SS.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0709 
 
 
 
22
[RJ] The guards weren™t like that. For inst
ance, if you get a guard on his own then 
he used to call Hitler a nd all thes e, ﬁsilly bug
gersﬂ and all. They did n™t believe in it 
no more than we did. They could se
e what was happening but they were 
controlled by the Nazis, weren™t t
hey? So they didn™t have a chance. 
[DL] And do you remember, a censor watc
hing the play s at the same time as you 
were on the stage? 
[RJ] Might have been,  I™m not sure.  

[DL] So in terms of where you would 
have pr eferred to have been between E715 
Auschwitz where the conditions were bette
r for yourselves in terms of shower 
facilities a n d toilet facilities (Ron: yeah) but
 where you were cons
tantly afraid  that 
you might end up in the gas chambers, as
 you mentioned earlier
, or the Italian 
camps wh ere the facilities were n™t so good . Where would you h ave preferred to 

have been? 

[RJ] Oh, the German camp, definitely. 

[DL] At E715? 

[RJ] Oh, yes, at E715? 

[DL] Even though–  

[RJ] Stalag VIIIB was another place wher e 
the facilities were first class, no 
problem.  

[DL] So even though  the facilities were 
there how did the Br
itish POWs feel 
knowing that the crematoria and t he gas 
chambers were there and that there was 
all that suffering? 

[RJ] Well t here was  a lways t
hat fear, you didn™t want to
 believe it  but there was  
always that fear in the back 
of your mind that it coul
d happen to you, I suppose.  
[DL] And, how, in terms of the Jews and 
that suffering being so close to you and 
the facilities which y o u had at y our ca
mp which were arguab
ly better than they  
were at Italy and obviously certainly a 
lot better than anything that the Jewish 
victims were suffering Œ what sort of 
feeling did that leave in your camp? 
[RJ] Hard t o describ e really. 
I mean, it nev er used to bo
ther us all t hat much but 
there was always that  fear that we used 
to talk about s ometimes, ﬁAye, I suppose 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0709 
 
 
 
23
we™d be next.ﬂ That type of thing. You made a joke of it. You know. You never 
took it serious. 

[DL] And apart from the plays, the card
 games and the football, were there any  

other recreational activiti
es that was going on? 
[RJ] Yes. There were all 
sorts going on. They used to
 have people who play in 
chess club,  they™d hav e whist driv es a
lways something going on in the recreation 

hut as we™d  call it. 

[DL] And when did you take 
part in these activities? 
[RJ] After we™d co
me back and had our food at night time. 
[DL] In the evening? 

[RJ] You were nev er idle. Ther e was  a
lways something to do in the evenings.  
Always.  

[DL] And was this  because you wer e pre-occupying y o urselves to take 

yourselves  away from the horror of 
what you were witnessing during the day? 
[RJ] Naturally, yep. 

[DL] So, this was almost unique in te
rms of your experience as  a POW (Ron:  
yes, yes) in Italy (Ron: yes) 
where you didn™t seem to do,  
[00:50:00] 
[DL] is there a difference in the recreational
 t ime in Italy compared to your time at 
E715.  

[RJ] In Italy, it was shocking.  

[DL] I think what I™m trying to driv e at is
 that were you deliber
ately trying to create 
different games, different activities, – 

[RJ] Occupy your mind, more than anything. 

[DL] Why did you think  you had to do that? 

[RJ] Because if you didn™t then you woul
d be lying on your bed dreaming about  
home Œ we used to talk and if we were 
chatting then it  was alway s about what  
food you™d have when you get
 home, what restaurants you™d go to when you got  
home all those kinds of things so it wa
s better that you had
 something to do  
[DL] And did people c hat about what was happening to the Jews? 

[RJ] Yes, we were absolutely appalled. We just couldn™t  believe it.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0709 
 
 
 
24
[DL] So what did people talk 
about when you did talk about it? 
[RJ] How d isgusting  it was. 
Terrible. Sometime you just 
couldn ™t b eliev e it. It just 
didn™t make sense.  
[DL] How common was the knowledge of
 mass murder and the gas chambers? 
[RJ] Everyone knew about it because we 
used to talk about it and another thing 
we used to see because the Jews in Mo
nowitz who used to wo rk in the works 
were on the other side of 
the football field when their lif
e in the f actory was  over, 
we used to see a lorry go up the road with 
them all standing up in there and we 
used to say, ﬁOh there™s another l
oad going up to the gas chamber.ﬂ 
[DL] And how often would you see that? 

[RJ] Once a week. I forget know. 

[DL] And how many people would you say in that lorry? 

[RJ] Oh, I don™t know. 40? Ma
ybe 50? Something like that? 
[DL] And were these all men? 

[RJ] All men. It was menthat worked in the works. 

[DL] Did you see any women in the works? 

[RJ] No, no. 

[DL] So it was just men? 
[RJ] We never saw any women working in
 the works. The only women we s a w 
working in the works was 
Ukraines and Poles. People
 like that. There was  no 
Jewish women. I never saw a Je
wish woma n in the works.  
[DL] How were the J ewish  wo men, so
rry, the Ukranian women treated in the 
works compared to the Jews? 

[RJ] Well, we used to try to get in touc
h wit h them naturally (laughs). I have heard 
of one fellow, I don™t 
k now who it  was, made a big 
friend of one of the Ukrainian 
women and actually went 
and v isited her after the 
war and they got married. I 
don™t know how true that is but I did her
e about it that they
 had got married.  
[DL] How far away from the crematoria would you say you were? 

[RJ] I would say about two and a half k
ilometers, two to three kilometers. 
[DL] And, upon occasion you could see the smoke? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0709 
 
 
 
25
[RJ] We could see the smoke. Another th
ing we could do. I remember being up 
on top of one of those kr
amers one day  and you could 
look down into the wor ks  
in the crematorium area. 
[DL] Could you see transports arrive? 

[RJ] I thought I saw a tr
ain but I™m not sure.  
[DL] In terms of, just going 
back  to the football matches 
briefly. You were the goal 
keeper in the Welsh team. What was t
he actual atmosphere like during those 
games? 

[RJ] Great. You used to forget ev
erything and just play football.  
[DL] In terms of the act
ual duration, and I know we 
touched upon this earlier, how 
long do you think the games lasted for? 

[RJ] Oh, about, I can™t reme
mber, you used t o get tired 
quick. I should think about 
half an hour each way.  

[DL] And the reason for you getting so tired so quickly? 

[RJ] Malnutrition,
 wasn™t it.  
[DL] You wore a Wels h playing badge and 
obvious ly the kit came from the Red 
Cross but where did y our Welsh pl
aying badge actually come from? 

[RJ] I had a fellow, draw. If our socks wore 
out they™d give us
 s quares of cloth 
around 12 inches square  

[DL] This is the Germ ans? 
[00:55:00] 
[RJ] I took a piece off one day and I c
an™t remember his name, Aiden John I think 
it was from Pontypridd and he drew t
he Prince of Wales f
eathers on there and I  
embroided it with som e of 
the old socks that we threw away. I made elev en of  
them whether the other fellows brought
 them home or not I don™t know.  
[DL] And you still hav e that today? 
[RJ] I still have it, yeah.  

[DL] There were photographs that were actu
ally taken of the team Œ of the W elsh 
team. How were those photogr aphs do
ne? The photographs, who took  the 
photographs? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0709 
 
 
 
26
[RJ] The Poles used to come int o our ca mp, repairing and all so
rts of things so 
we used t o give them a packet of cigarettes, all sorts of things, a bar of  
chocolate. And they used to take photographs. 

[DL] Did it ever surprise 
you that  the Naz is and their 
plans for mass murder were 
obvious ly authorized in secrecy and yet y o
u were so aware of
 what was  going on 
around you and certainly allo
wing Poles into the camp to take photographs of 
yourself and from what you were sayi
ng about ordinary me
mbers of the German 
Army being your guards. Does t hat surpri
se you in terms of the lack of security 
around you, the openness with which murder was happening? 

[RJ] If the Poles cam e into the camp
 to do anything then a guard always cam e  

with him. He was never away from him so
 he couldn™t talk. But if he brought a 
camera in, I think it was done 
once and then it just caught on. 
[DL] But does the openness of the nature 
of the abuses that were happening 
around you, does that surprise you when 
you look at how sec r etive the Nazis  
were?  

[RJ] Yeah, but the guards weren™t like t
hat . They used to help y ou more than 
hinder you.  

[DL] These were the German Army? 
[RJ] The German guards were alright 
Œ no problem. We never had any pr oblem 
with the German guards.  
[DL] But it would only be the SS 
if you were to have a problem? 
[RJ] Oh, the SS, that™s a 
different kettle of fish.  
[DL] And did you ever 
have problems with the SS? 
[RJ] No, I didn™t but I 
know several who did.  
[RJ] In what way? 

[DL] Well, they used to search and if t
hey found anything then they just accepted 
it, took it - which annoyed 
some fellows of course.  
[DL] So, were there any punishm ents given by the SS to the British? 

[RJ] No, I know a couple of chaps whogot caught with stuff, like I did with my 

eggs, and they stuck them in a civilian priso n
 for a couple of days. I™ll tell you one  

thing that happened. Don™t fo
rget the perim eter of the works enc losed the village 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0709 
 
 
 
27
so evidently one of the boys found like a bit of a small duck, or whatever it was, 
so he killed  it as it was around Christma
s time and he brought it back in. He tied  

the legs ar ound his waist and he had the 
neck down where his  old boy  was and 
the guard f ound it, touched it, 
he thought he was 
looking for women. Anyway,  he 
found it and he took him into the guard r
oom and he come back laughing as  even 
the Verlthere was laughing 
about it and let me keep it
 so he brought it home.  
[DL] Just going back to the way in which 
the Jews wer e actually t r eated, did you 
ever discus s their conditions onc e you pl
ay ed your football, ha
d cards, or during 
rehearsals in the play, did you discuss at t
hat point how you felt t hey were being 
mistreated. What sort 
of discussions did you ever have on the subject? 
[RJ] I don™t remember. 
I just don™t remember. 
[DL] How many men were 
there at E
715 Auschwitz? 
[01:00:00] 
[RJ] I always understood that there were 2
80 of us who went out to Auschwitz.  
But of course when they bombed t
he factory one day, a bomb dropped in our  
camp and killed about  30 or 40 of our men.  

[DL] The bombing raid at E715 
Auschwitz, when did that happen? 
[RJ] One Sunday morning.  
[DL] Do you remember
 the year? The date? 
[RJ] It must have been during forty four. 
I can™t remember dates. It must hav e  
been around forty four. 

[DL] And what actually  happened? 

[RJ] Well, we used to hear the sirens
 going off. Oh, one day, it happened when 
we were down in the works and a 
few of us jumped into a trench. 
[DL] And the actual bombing raid? 

[RJ] Now, if I remember ri
ghtly, we were inj ured when we
 were in that trench and 
we had blood coming from our mouths 
and our bottoms and I was taken into 
hospital for  three or four days, civ vy hos
pital. Who was with me I can™t remember. 
When you talk about these things memo
ries come back don™t they? I can™t 
remember any more than that? 

[DL] And the bombing ra
id of fort y four? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0709 
 
 
 
28
[RJ] During forty four, yes.  
[DL] What happened and 
where were you? 
[RJ] It™s only once I remember when I was 
put in hospital. But basically it  was  

always on a Sunday morning when there 
was no on e working there and then 
they used to get us in on Monday  
to get everything right again.  
[DL] You t alked about, earlier,
 before we s t arted the in
terview about the c arpet  
bombing Œ could you talk 
us through that again? 

[RJ] When the sirens went off we used to
 watch the planes Œ they weren™t very 
high they used to come in from four quar
ters and we us ed to say, Hello, Number 
one shovel ready and they used to come dow n all at once. They called it carpet 

bombing, I think. But the sky wa
s full of these little bombs. 
[DL] And on the Sunday when the air raid shelter was hit Œ what actually  

happened? 

[RJ] Well they used t o drop into the wo
rks and on one occasion,
 I  think there was  
a bombing raid about three or
 four times whilst I was there. They used to get us  
to work the following morning to rect
ify all the problem
s which had happened. 
[DL] You were in a depression, a small grove? 

[RJ] Yes, yes, when the bomb dropped on ou
r camp. The Germans allowed us to 
dig a trenc h and put some tin sheets over
 the top and then 
the earth would be 
put over it. Now I™m a bit cl
austrophobic, luc kily, and I didn
™t go in there. I wasn™t  
the only one mind, there was quite a few of 
us who didn™t go into the shelter. We 
just lay on the ground outside an
d, of course, a bomb went right into the entrance 
of the shelter, chaos, chaos. I think there 
was about thirty or fo
rty killed there and 
they were buried in the cemetery up in 
the village but when I went back there to 
look they™d been taken from there and put  
into a proper cemetery for British 
soldiers.  
[DL] What was the f
eeling amongst British soldiers afterwards? 
[RJ] Oh, terrible. Terrible. 
Hard to describe. We were all upset ,  of course we 

were.  

[DL] What about the experiences the Jews
 would tell you about? Did the J ews  
talk about their experiences with you? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0709 
 
 
 
29
[RJ] No. No. You wouldn™t
 get near enough to a Jew to talk about. At least I 
didn™t. I have heard that others di
d but I didn™t get near enough.  
[DL] Why was that? 
[RJ] There wasn™t any Jews working in my area. 

[DL] So your working 
party at IG Farben? 
[RJ] Was in a little section. There were 
Jews out in t he front lik e where we saw 
them digging trenches and a
ll they were but–.  
[01:05:00] 
[RJ] –we were in an area with machinery you know. 
[DL] Were any of the British POWs 
subjected to cruel, 
harsh or degrading 
treatment? 

[RJ] Appar ently so, apparently  so, I do
n™t know. I have heard of meeting 
somebody after the war and all this 
busines s but I don™t know about that. 
[DL] And in terms of conditions for people 
like yourself  who worked at IG Farben,  
what were conditions  like for yourself 
there? Also, there was the story of the 
Rolex watch and you swapping of ci
garettes for the Rolex watch.  
[RJ] How I come to ha ve the Ro le x watc
h, the Poles us ed to 
come bartering with 
us, of course, they wanted cigar ettes. O
ne day a Pole came with a little box and 
he opened it up and t here was 
a Rolex oys t er watch in 
there. He wanted s ome 
cigarettes. So, the following day,  I took down, I think, something like a couple of 

hundred cigarettes, a parcel for 
the Rolex oyster watch. 
[DL] And what happened to the watch? 

[RJ] Well, you know we left Auschwit
z in January 1945 and we were on that 
march and I had it on my wrist ,  of 
course, but you have 
your hands on your 
haversack and a German officer spotted this
 Rolex Oy ster wa
tch and he kept on 
pestering me and I thought he w
ould take it but in fa irness he didn™t but he did 
say to me, one day, he says ﬁyou may as well gi
v e this to me as your going to die 
one day anyway. You™re not going to comple
te this march.ﬂ That kind of thing but 
I don™t think they knew where we were
 going or what wa
s happening. Any way ,  
after a couple of days  he came with a s ack
 of bread. I don™t know
 where he got it  
from, Well, I couldn™t get the watch 
off quick enough, could I? There was a gang 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0709 
 
 
 
30
of us there and we had a good feast for 
a few days. It was plain bread but it was  
food.  
[DL] And do you know where the watch came
 from, the Pole who gave it to you? 
[RJ] I haven™t a clue. 

[DL] There were various stories afte
r the war from men who had been at E715 
Auschwitz who c laimed to
 hav e swapped places with 
(interruption from camer a  
operator and clap for sync at 01:07:41)–
 so the stories that came out after the 
war from individuals at E715 Auschwitz 
who claimed to have swapped places  
with–.  

[RJ] Denis Avey  

[DL] Denis Avey and Charlie Coward being
 two among them. Firstly, what™s your 
views on Charlie Coward™s story? 

[RJ] Oh, absolutely  a lot of
 lies. Definitely. What he 
s ays he done in the works is  
just plain stupid. In one instance, he sa
ys he had a ha rd cart and he went do wn 
into the works with a handcart. He never c o
me out of  E175, I never see him in 
the works and where did he get the handcar
t from? I never saw any hard cart. 
And he used to go around the works and 
get the dead Jews out Œ what for?  
[DL] So Charlie Cowar d who was the POW 
liaison officer for the Red Cross, what  
you™re saying is whilst he claime
d to get radio parts as well–  
[RJ] Whether he got the parts. I don™t th
ink so. Someone else got  the parts and 
then he looked after the wirele
ss, he knew where it was. 
[DL] Fine. So he was the one 

[RJ] As far as I know 

[DL] But as far as him being down in the 
wor ks, you nev er saw him  there– so his  
story of the handcart– 

[RJ] It™s all poppycock.  

[DL] So, his story about finding–  

[RJ] And I™ve talked to Dougie Bond and 
he says the s ame thing. He says  it was  
all lies. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0709 
 
 
 
31
[DL] So Charlie Coward whose affidavit
 was presented to Nuremberg after the 
war and in his book
 where he talks about how he
 swapped places with s omeone 
in the Jewish concentration camp ther
e. In your mind that isn™t possible? 
[RJ] From my point of view, yes,
 I couldn™t see it happening, no.  
[DL] More recently, Denis Avey (
Jones: He said the same thing
) has gone on to 
write alongside a Brit
ish journalis t–  
[01:10:00] 
[DL] –a book called 
The Man Who Broke into Ausc hwitz
, what ™s your vie w on 
Denis Avey ™s story? 
[RJ] A lot of his book is authentic but 
as  far as he said that he would change 

places wit h this Jew. I just can™t believe
 it. I just can™t. If
 you could see the 
situation you™d say the same thing. 

[DL] What makes you believe that he 
couldn™t  do what he claimed to have done? 

[RJ] Well. For instance, when we walked
 into our camp in the evenings,  we 
always walked in with our hands up stretc
hed. If a Jew had done that, he just  
couldn™t. You should have s
een the state of them. They
 used to shamble about. 
They didn™t  walk, they just shambled about with their heads bent, shoulders bent, 

they just couldn™t straight
en up, they just couldn™t 
h ave held t heir hands  up. 
Impossible.  

[DL] What changes ac tually occurred in 
the camp towards the end of the war? 
[RJ] Not a lot really. W e noticed that the 
guards weren™t  as keen as they used to 
be. They were more friendl
y, put it that way.  
[DL] When you say they weren™t as keen as they used to be? 

[RJ] Well, they™d ta lk to you. The y wo
uldn™t have talked to 
you before. On that 
march, for instance, alright they contro
lled you but not in the same sense as  
guards would normally do. They
 used to stic k us in barn
s and leave us overnight.  
I think they would go to the farmhouse for a meal where as we were s hut in 

barns. 

[DL] In terms of changes towards atti
tudes towards the Jews. W hat changes did 
you notice in their treatment? Did you notice any different changes? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0709 
 
 
 
32
[RJ] No, no. The only t hing that I saw at t
he end of the war is that
 they let a lot of 
the Jews out when they could hear t
he Russians fig hting and when we wer e  
marching through the Carpathian mountains
 we saw Jews dead on the side of 
the road. Loads of them. 
[DL] So, how did the march actually start? 

[RJ] About the second week of Januar
y 45 and we were hoping that the 
Russians would release us because we c
ould hear  them fighting up the road, 
several miles away of course, Jerry walk
ed into the camp and told us to pick up 
what gear we could c arry as ﬁwe are ma
rching you out.ﬂ They stuck us on the 
road and, apparently,  it was one of the worst 
winters they had had for fifty years. 
The temperature was around 15 to 20 degr
ees below,  they marched us through 
the Carpat hian mountains and down th
rough Cz ec hoslovak ia.  We were 17 
weeks. I wrote it all down on the back 
of one of Gladys™ photogr aphs. We were 
17 weeks on the road and we marched something lik e 9000 miles.  

[DL] 900 miles? 

[RJ] About 900 miles. We had no food 
and even the guards themselves didn™t  
have any rations to give us. All we ate, they used to put us in barns at night time, 

all we ate was what the animals  ate or 
what was in the barns: carrots, Swedes ,  
mangoes. I remember kicking a pig out 
of the way once and pinching the 
potatoes he was eating.  

[DL] In terms of the route 
(interruption by c a mera ope
rator and additional c l ap for 
sync at 01:14:03).
 When you started the march, w
hat evidence was there for the 
Jews taking the same rout
e as you were now taking? 
[RJ] We saw them died on the side of the r
oad, they just couldn™
t take it. I didn™t  
count them but I saw dozens and I m
ean dozens of dead bodies  on the side of 
the road in the snow. 

[DL] In terms of yourselves, how
 bad were conditions on that route? 
[RJ] Terrible, absolutely appal
ling. Don™t forget there we
re thousands on the r oad 
getting away from the Russ ians  but the 
guards took us ar
ound country lanes Œ 
that™s how we come into the barns. 

[DL] Were there abuses?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0709 
 
 
 
33
[01:15:00] 
[DL] Did prisoners of war die on this march? 
[RJ] Yes. We tried to couple of them. I 
tried to help a couple of them. There was  
one fellow from Jersey, I remember he lost 
part of his  nose from frostbite. I tried 
to pick him  up. I just couldn™
t. I was in a st ate myself. I ju
st left him there. I just 
presume he died, I just don™t know. As far as I know when we got to Regensburg 

in Austria, there was about 150 of us so 
there was clos e to 80 or 90 that had died 
on the side of the road. 

[DL] How did you fair during the course of this march? 

[RJ] Shattered, knackered. I shambled. I 
was in a terrible state and I think what  
kept me alive was my 
Role x Oyster watch.  
[DL] Because you swapped it for food? 

[RJ] I swapped it for food. But don™t forget
 that I was a n extremely fit young man 
when I joined the army. I was thirteen stone 
two and as fit as a fiddle. I belo nged 
to the Oxford boys, I was weight
 lifting. I was extremely fit. 
[DL] When you finished the wa
lk, what weight were you? 
[RJ] When I finished t he march, I ended up
 in Regens burg. I didn™t know it was  
Regens burg. They put us in a bar n and the 
f ollowing m orning they  didn™t open up 
and someone said, ﬁHey, the guards ar
e gone.ﬂ So we got out. We heard 
rumours that the Americans were clos
e, mind. To give you an idea what 
happened, some of the boys fo
und a cellar in the barn and 
he found some joints  
of pork and all whic h the farmer had hung up 
and naturally it dis appeared didn™t 
it? And then the guards said that they were going to line us up and shoot us all 

as the farmer had created a fuss over t
he missing meat  but t
he next morning and 
the guards were gone.  

[DL] So, what month was this? 

[RJ] This was April forty five. The end of April. 

[DL] And how were you actually freed? 

[RJ] We got out of the bar n and loads of us and don™
t forget that we wer e  
covered in lice, I lost my
 boots and we walk ed 
down in to the town and found the 
town was Regens burg and we f ound a hot el called the 
Gruener Kranz
 and we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0709 
 
 
 
34
realized that the Americans
 had been billeted there. The Americans in those 
days were issued with what was called Co
mpo parcels so, of course we found a 
lot of them with food in, so
me had cigarettes in, some 
had gum in. We made pigs  
of ourselves and then the Yanks came out and I don™t know how m any of us but I 
know the Yanks cam e and took  us up to 
a place  called a delousing centre and 
they took us in there and they deloused 
us and then they took 
a crowd of us to 
what I would call a rest centre. It was 
just, I can™t remember really, but I would 

describe it as a rest c entre
 and t here, they took all of our clothes and burnt them.  
I came home, dressed as a Yankee soldier,
 they kitted us out as a raw recruit. I 
still have the two bla nkets upstairs and I hav
e the knife and fork in the draw. I 
came home dressed as a Yankee soldier. I 
was in this rest centre for close on a 
fortnight. By this time I wa
s getting better, of course, but
 by this time I was only 
just over seven stone when the Yanks 
pick ed me up. Then they  put us on t he 
Red Cross train and took us to Le Harve an
d there there was a fleet of Dakot as. I 
landed at Aylesbury  in Buckinghamshir
e. They had long tables there with 
telegrams all written out and we  just 
filled our name and ad dr
ess and what wa s  
on the telegram was ﬁArrived 
in England. See you soon.ﬂ  
[01:20:00] 
[RJ] Then we had a medica
l and a shower  and the fo
llowing morning we got on 
trains. 
[DL] And– 

[RJ] When we got home, I think it was the 
first week of May. The first week in 
May– 

[DL] When you arrived back home. 

[RJ] When I arrived back home.  

[DL] When you returned back to South 
Wales, what was people™s attitudes 
towards you? 

[RJ] Well, of course, I got invited to all sorts. I used to be called down and I never 

told anybody about Auschwitz though. I told my family but I never told anyone 

else. They just thought I was a German pris
oner of war for three and a half years 
and that was it. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0709 
 
 
 
35
[DL] Why didn™t you tell anyone? 
[RJ] It just didn™t dawn on me totell anyone about Auschwit z. It was just a 

wartime experience best forgotten and sinc
e then, you ask Bishop and all, and I 
bet you they™ll tell you the same thing: they never told anybody.  

[DL] Why was that? 

[RJ] I just  don™t know. To me, it was ju
st a wartime experience and that was it.  
[DL] What was your state of
 health like when you got back? 
[RJ] By the time I got home I was still 
unde r eight stone. I remember Gladys, my 
wife, put m e in the bath on the first night
 and she started crying. I said ﬁLove, 
don™t cry. I™m here in one piec e. I left m
en out there who will never  come home.ﬂ 
That sober ed her up a bit but she was 
upset, of course, the state I was in. 
Another thing was that I was covered in 
boils  for 18 months to two years. For  
eighteen months I had them
 everywhere and when I sa
y ever ywhere, I mean 
everywher e, and then one day,  a local 
doctor, Dr Desmond Hull s aid, ﬁCome 
over to the surgery, Ron.ﬂ I knew him from school, of course. He gave me a little 

tiny bottle of tablets. There 
was no labe l on  it, just a littl
e bottle of little tiny tablets 
and he astonished me. He said, ﬁTake 14 
on the first day then 12 then 10 until 

you™ve taken the whole bottle and I took 
them and I™ve never had a boil since .  Not 
even a pimple.  
[DL] And, your ment
al state of health? 
[RJ] I was in a shocking state. If a 
plane went overhead 
then I was under the 
bed, straightaway. No problem
. Gladys used to coax me
 out but she wouldn™t get 
me out until that plane had gone.  

[DL] In terms of nightmares? 

[RJ] I used to get terrible nightm ares. Fo
r instance, when I went back to work I 
occasionally worked night and she was in 
bed, naturally. I used to walk upst airs 
backwards, I used to look behind me all t
he time. Nerves, I was a bag of nerves. I 
used to los e my temper, I was in a terrible st
ate. I should say that 
it took me all of 
about five years at least to get back to w
hat I would call a normal man. I™ve never 
ever weighed 13 stone again Œ I™ve got to
 twelve but I™ve never been bigger.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0709 
 
 
 
36
[DL] When you realized the extent of T
he Holocaust and the numbers involved at 
Auschwitz. 
[RJ] Terrible, terrible, yeah. 

[DL] Did you ever realize that
 it was that bad at Auschwitz? 

[RJ] Yeah, well, we learnt 
then that different people wo uld 
talk to us. I learnt then 
that it wasn™t only Jews who were put
 to death there. I 
think there was about 
30,000 Jehovah™s Wit nesses, there were
 29000 gyps ies, there were Russians, 
there were all sorts 
apart from the Jews.  
[DL] But being so close to what was 
happening, what psychological effect did 
that have on you after the war w
hen you realized what was happe ning? 

[RJ] Oh, I don™t know, I forget now. I never
 told anybody. I never spoke about it. It 
wasn™t until Sch ind ler ™s L ist wh en it 
first came on t he te
levision. But nobody 
talked about Auschwitz in those days. It just
 wasn™t discussed, I never talked to 
anybody about it. 

[DL] Why, why not? 

[RJ] I don™t know. And I™ve spoken to 
s everal. Dougie Bond.  He nev er told 
anybody. Denis Av ey Œ he never told anybody until r ecently. I just don™t know. It 

was just one of those things which happened during the war and you just forgot 
about it  
[01:25:00]
 
[RJ] and then you just start
ed to put it on the televisi
on and then, of course, all 
your memories come back.  
[DL] Did you go back to Auschwit z? 

[RJ] Yes, in 1999, my  nephew s aid to me 
one day, ﬁLike to go back to Ausc hwitz, 
uncle Ron?ﬂ I said, ﬁYeah, I wouldn™t mind, why?ﬂ ﬁI™d like to go,ﬂ he said. So he 

booked the plane to go and on the Wednes day, he rang me up and said, ﬁCome 

into the office,ﬂ he was an estate agent, y
ou know. So I went to the office and put 
a tie on and when I  went t
her e, the loc a l paper, the 
Argus  was there, with a 
photographer and took my story.
 That was the first time 
I™d told anybody about it. 
Then on the Thursday, I had a telephone ca
ll from HTV, they
 understood I was  
going back  to Auschwitz on Friday and coul
d I have t he number  of your flight. I

think they were willing 
to send a photographer with 
me. Anyway, there was no 
room on the plane apparently and so w
hen I came back I came home on the 
Monday. On the Tues day, I had another phone call from HTV and they said ,  
ﬁCan we c ome and see you?ﬂ So they came here and, of course, I was on the 

television a couple of days after. 

[DL] In terms of your experience at
 Aus chwitz when you went back, what  
memories did that create? 

[RJ] Oh, terrible. I couldn™t
 sleep. I could see them Jews walking about a gain .  

Proper nostalgic.  

[DL] When you talked about t
he J ews walk in g about, obviously  this  is s omething 
which has stayed with you. Why has that
 been such an overwhelmingly powerful 
memory for you? 

[RJ] Well, when I came home and HTV found 
out about it, a local Argus came to 
see me and I had a big write up in the lo
cal press and the local he admasters saw 
it and could I come along and have a c
hat  with the c hildren. I™v e been down t o  

three or four schools  and 
then groups of people asked 
me to come and so I 
calle d it ﬁThe So ldier™s Story.ﬂ Then wh
en they found out about me, the ASA film  
company, Steven Saunders, phoned me and said 
could he hav e an interview. So 
he did and they came here and, I don™t know
 if you™ve seen it, they made a  film  
calle d ﬁ
The Long March to Freedom
.ﬂ It was on the 
Yesterday
 programme and I 
still have a DVD of it if 
you™d like to borrow it. 
[DL] You were talking about your memory– 

[RJ] And t hen my m emory started to co
me back but I could n™t remember then 
and how but the more I talk about it 
then little things come back to me. 
[DL] Were you interviewed after the war 
at all for your  experienc e at Auschwitz ?  
Did any war crimes investigators interview you? 

[RJ] I don™t think so. No, it was mostly new
s papers, magazines, that kind of thing.  
[DL] That would have happened in the latter 
part of your life as opposed to after 

the war? 

[RJ] Yes, since ﬁ
The Long March to Freedom
ﬂ was on the television and people 
saw that and people wanted to know about it. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0709

[DL] But, in terms of actual war inve
stigators or war crime investigat ors? 
[RJ] No, no. 
[DL] Because Reynolds, Corporal Re
ynolds ™ shooting was investigated  
[RJ] I never heard anything about 
it at all. Nobody asked me.  
[DL] Did you stay in the army? 

[RJ] No. When I came home, 
of course, as I told you,
 I had a reserve occupation 
and my father was a blacksmith in t
he s ame firm as me and the personnel 
manager said ﬁI hear Ron is  
home, I expect he™d like to
 come out, wouldn™t he?ﬂ  
My father said, ﬁI should think so.ﬂ So
 while I  was home, they gave me ten weeks 

leave. While I was home on that ten 
weeks, Birchall, the personnel manager  

came to see me and s aid, ﬁAre y ou ready 
to come out?ﬂ And I said, ﬁOf course I 
would.ﬂ He took all my parti
culars and while I was home  
[01:30:00]
 
[RJ] I had to go to the pensions  place in Ca
rdiff and I think, if I wanted, that I  
would hav e got a pension but I  didn™t wa
nt a pens ion becaus e y ou had to lose 
time at work if you™d keep y our  pens i
on. I heard rumours about this but  they 
regarded me from B1 to B4
 and then they  said whe n  you go back, I had a War 
Office letter, when you go back you™ll go 
back to the engin
eers at Pangbourne, 
near Reading. So, I was there for about thre
e to four weeks and I came hom e for 
a weekend™s leave we were allowed to 
go back on the midn
ight train and we 
were allowed to go onto the parade ground t
he following morning.
 So, I got there 
and went onto the parade ground and the Se
rgeant Major said to me: ﬁCorporal 
Jones, what are you doing here?ﬂ  I said I 
had just come off fr
om weekend leave, 
I thought I was in trouble. ﬁThere™s a letter 
in the office for you.ﬂ I went in there 
and there were my release papers. My 
personnel manager had got me out so I 
was only in the army for ten weeks and four days. I got out. 
[DL] What did you go on to do and how l
ong did you stay in that job for? 
[RJ] I came home then and my father took
 me down to see Mr Birchall and he 
said, ﬁyou can start work whenever you lik e, 
Ron. I™ll give you 
a light job to start 
with.ﬂ So I did a light job 
for approximately a month and then went back to my old 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0709 
 
 
 
39
job so I didn™t have any trouble, like a 
lot of these people 
who write book s who 
have problems, I didn™
t have any problems. 
[DL] But did you have any nightmares? 
[RJ] I had nightmares for years. Ages. 

[DL] And what did those nightmares consist of? 

[RJ] Things like I was running away, I was climbing a fence. I was slipping back 

or climbing a path and t
hen, all of a sudden, som
eone would put a hand on my 
shoulder and I would st
art to scream.  
[DL] Did you have nightmares about
 the Jews and the gas chambers? 
[RJ] No, no. Not the Jews.  

[DL] Looking back now, what key memo
ry determines your time at E715 
Auschwitz? 

[RJ] I™ve forgotten it, really
. Until people started to talk to me about  it about it I just 
don™t bother about it. 

[DL] Why do you think you have forgotten about it? 

[RJ] Well, I suppose it  was just a war ti
me experience that was best forgotten.  
Loads of people hav e wartime experiences.  

[DL] How did it your experience at  E715 a
ffect you during the course of your life? 
It has definitely, I am not t
he man that I was. As a matter of fact, before the war I 
was a shy, quiet, timid man and, of cour
se, I met Gladys when I was 15 and I had 

a lovely lif e, no problems, but since then
 I used to lose my temper quick. I™d 
argue now and I wouldn™t acce
pt things that I would of before the war. I™m a 
different man now, definitely different. 

[DL] Would you say that that was bec
ause of your experi
ence at Auschwitz? 
[RJ] At Auschwitz. 

[DL] So what caused that change at Auschwitz? 

[RJ] Being pushed around, being 
told what to do. I™ve never been in my life been 
told what t o do before. I had my own job my own life, I™ve been m y own boss  and 

nobody ™s told me what to do.

[DL] And, did witnes sing abuse at Auschwit
z, or being aware 
of abuse, as I  
appreciate your workplace was away from
 the main factory,
 but hearing of the 
abuses there, the knowledge of the gas
 chambers, did that also change you? 
[RJ] It must have. It must
 have. I must have taken not
ice of it, more than what 
you realize.  
[DL] You mentioned about the 
memory of how the J ews walked. Why is that an 
important memory for you? 

[RJ] They were dying on their f eet fr
om lack of food. They™d walk about  like 
people dying. Shambles. Shambles.  
[01:35:00]
 
[DL] Is there anything else you want to 
add, is there anything els e that you feel 
we haven™t touched upon. 
[RJ] No.
