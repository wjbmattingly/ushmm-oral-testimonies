Question: Today is the 16
th
 of August, 2010, and I™m 
J a c ek No wako wski
, 
conducting interview with Mr. 
Edwa rd Klein
, who is a survivor of the 
Lódz 
ghetto. 
And Mr. 
Klein ,  
if you could state your vital statis
tical information, when  you were 
born Œ you Œ you just menti
oned different names that you were known, etcetera, so 
if you could just repeat that, that 
will make it easier to Œ to place. 
Answer: Ah , yes. I was born as
 Isaac Klein
. I™m still planning Œ 
trying to get the 
exact date. Was in contact with the relevant offices in
 Poland
, and so mebody who is 
doing research for it. Either in ™26, 1926 or 1927, May the 30
th
. About May the 30
th
, 
I am sure. 
Q: And you were born in 
Sieradz
? 
A: 
Sieradz
, yes. 
Q: Right. So, if you could tell us in a Œ little
 bit about your Œ what
 your recollections 
from the pre-war time you Œ you lived in
 Sieradz
, or you lived in 
Lódz
? 
A: No, I have lived in 
Sieradz
. Two older brothers. That I 
Œ I may be Œ and the out Œ 
onset, I am the only one of the 
family left, there was a larg
e family. But at the end of 
the war, there was no one left but I. I kno
w that because we have decided that 
whoever survives wh erever, our contact 
is people we know, distant relatives in
 
Palestine Œ
 at that time
 Palestine, Erat Israel
, and there was Œ no one appeared 

RG-50.030*0580

except my self. I learned about wit Œ wh at ha
ppened  to the others here and there, 
through other people at one time witnessing. 
Q: Could you describe little b
it more th Œ you said that 
it was a larg e family, so Œ 
A: Yes. 
Q: Œ could you descri
be th Œ your family? 
A: My grandmother, grandfat
her, it looked to me like my  f-family have lived many 
generations in the city, but this probably 
is a child™s perception. Maybe it was the 
first generation; to me it was people w
ho were settled there 
from who knows when, 
en
 antiquity. Wh ere my grandfather, my  grandmother had 
Alimarat
(ph) and 
Hannah. Hannah
 who had seven sons. My 
father was the oldest, 
Shmuel
(ph), and 
Œ and then there were still two daughters. So
, nine children all together, then older, 
extended family, the spouses and my  cousin
s. And I am aware of many other names, 
from letters, photographs, occasi
onal visits from out of town . 
Q: Well, d-do Œ do letters that you still have
 today, or those are 
the letters that you 
remember from the pre-war time? 
A: No, I think too many times I w as, 
like I had to undress and throw all my Œ 
whatever I had and start from the beginning 
with Œ with nothing from before. I have 
a picture of my family, it survived 
Œ it survived in someone™s hands in 
Palestine
, 
and I think that I have it on me.  
Q: Oh, oh, that™s great. 

RG-50.030*0580

A: Myself, there were two brothers, much older, and I. They perished as partisans, 
and a book depicts what they were doi
ng, a book wh ich was published in 
New 
York
, that was ﬁ
From the Forest.ﬂ 
Q: So where Œ where were they, 
as partisans? Wh-What region? 
A: Originally Œ well, I just know that it wa
s Œ they were in an area which was a Œ a 
part of 
Poland
 once, taken over by the Œ by the 
Russians. The Russians put them on 
a train, that™s what I learned from others, 
because they register to come back, the 
Russians considered this a risky element of 
people, because they want to go back to 
Germany
. They wanted to
 go back to 
Germany
 to fetch my parents and I. But all 
that train was sent to 
Siberia
. Would they  have stayed, 
they would maybe survived. 
As it is they ran away from the train, in
to the forest, hiding from the Russians, 
starting to fight the Germans, even before 
the Œ officially the partisan organization 
was Œ was known, or whatever
 Œ ever ge Œ organized.  
Q: So so meone surv ived , who co  Œ 
A: One person su-survived, consider that, a
nd he was later able to write about that, 
and that™s Œ that™s how I learned that my 
brothers didn™t die in Œ in the conditions I 
experienced, that they were fighti
ng til the end. And this is the one 
[indecipherable]
 
that I can accept. 
Q: So what Œ wh at is your recollection of
 Œ what was Œ what was your father and 
your mo ther doing, what were they doing before the war? 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
6
A: My Œ my  father was a Œ a merchant, an
d my  mo ther was home. We Œ I think my  
parents had to be careful with money, th
ose were the times, and it was very often 
coming up when  I heard that they were 
worrying about tuition to Œ for me to 
continue education. 
Q: Well, he was Œ your father was a merchant? 
A: Yes. 

Q: D-Do  you recall wh at was he dealing in ? 

A: Oh, he dealt for the 
area, I think, the soap 
maida,
(ph) cosmetics of 
ma ida
(ph). 
At another Œ at another time, my  grandpar
ents had the wholesale grocery store, and 
for awhile my parents were
 running also a similar st
ore on th e same street. My 
brothers were Œ my  oldest brother was in a 
hafshara
(ph) in 
Ro vno
. And he was 
slated to go to Œ to 
Israel
. Shell sided, lost his gla sses in one of the battles and 
couldn™t see any mo re, was one of the first killed as a result. 

Q: Oh. So, he was alr
eady in that area, in 
Volhynia,
 in
 Ro vno
 before the war, so this 
was Œ 
A: He Œ he Œ he Œ he 
Œ yes, he was. But in 
the meantime h e came to
 Sieradz
 during 
the time they Œ th-the picture which I ha
d was taken, this was the occasion. And 
when  the war broke out, th
e family was together in
 Sieradz.
  
Q: Mm-hm, so your brothers as well? 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
7
A: My brothers as well. 
This is Œ we were living 
Sieradz, 
as close to the German 
border. We were advised to
 go to a forest in 
Zd u

ska Wola,
 six kilometers away to 
avoid gas attacks, that™s how World War I 
finished, and this was the big fear. But 
the Germans have advanced Œ this was sup
posed to be an  outing of a few hours, 
daylight only, and at night we™ll return
. The Germans mo ved so quickly that we 
couldn't go back, only  we had to  continue and march to
 Zd u

ska Wola
. We™re there 
when  Œ when 
Zd u

ska Wola
 was attacked by bombing a
nd two of my  grandparents 
died. We were just where 
they were shelterin g  in 
Zd u

ska Wola. 
My mo ther and I 
visited them, and we left, there was an 
alarm when  we Œ noise, when  we looked 
back, the house in wh
ich they were was demo lished. Th
ey were in the basement, and 
it went all three floors, so they we
re the first dead
 in the family. 
Q: And it Œ that happened in th e very first days of September of 1939? 
A: And Œ in days. I believe it was a Sunday
 and ah  Œ I know that because some body 
speculated that they probably 
wanted to catch as many ci
vilians as possible in one 
place, and initially went after the churches
 or whatever. The 
roads were machine-
gunned an d bombed, and it was Œ they were
 Œ they were making the road impass Œ 
im Œ impassable. After one of those a
ttacks, we couldn™t find my  brothers. 
Nevertheless, they Œ they surviv
ed that first period, came to 
Sieradz,
 left for
 Russia
 
to Œ to create a way for us to follow.  

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
8
Q: And do you recall it was, 
you know, they were going to 
Œ to th e Russian zone? It 
was planned with your parent
s when they still were in 
Sieradz
? 
A: Yes, we came to
 Sieradz
, but the Germans were living in Œ in  our house. A Œ a 
relative left
 Lódz 
to go to 
Warsaw
, family 
Eckstein
(ph), I believe, from 
Poganica
. 
And they  have Œ we lived Œ we lived in 
th eir house. This was Œ the house was on 
Piotrkowska 
82, which was the first street called 
Adolf Hitler Strasse
, and the 
main street in 
Lódz.
 And the first street to be cleane
d of Jews. So we were put into 
the ghetto at the very beginning, as it st
arted, I don™t remember the date, was it 
September, or whatever.  
Q: I Œ I just have few more que
stions that want to fill up Œ 
A: Specific, yes. 
Q: Œ with  Œ with the Œ with your pre-war 
time, and then  please don™t Œ because w-we 
Œ the point that we are at, 
it™ s very good. Your
 family was Œ what Œ what language 
was spoken in your family, if you remember? 
A: It Œ it was Yiddish and Po
lish. I was the Œ the excepti
on. I was spok
en only in 
Polish. I had a teacher, I had Mrs. 
Viner
(ph) 
Tova
(ph) whose husband was a 
historian, and sh e was a known Polish poet.
 And sh e thought that I have potential 
with rhymes and Œ or whateve
r, I think. And she actually 
talked to my parents to Œ 
not to in volv e me in another language, 
chayder
 or otherw ise, in order to keep my  
Polish intact.  

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
9
Q: Do Œ do you still 
speak Polish, right? 
A: Pardon? 
Q: Do you s Œ you still speak Polish? 

A: Yeah, I Œ I still s-speak Polish, yes. 
I don™t have much of an opportunity.  
Q: So, going back  to Œ to the 
be Œ th e beginning of the war Œ 
A: Yes. 

Q: Œ if Œ if I recall what you said, and 
i Œ ju st to summarize, you Œ in the beginning 
you were told Œ th-the family was to
ld to go into th
e wo ods outside of 
Sieradz
 Œ 
A: Yes. 

Q: Œ because of the fear of the Œ the gas attack  Œ  

A: Yes. 
Q: Œ and you landed close to 
Zd u

ska Wola
. 
A: Yes. 
Q: And from there Œ 

A: Six kilometers. 
Q: And from Œ and then  
Zd u

ska  Wola
 was bombed, your grandparents were 
killed, and then you went back to 
Sieradz
. 
A: Not my  grandparents. I believe to Œ th
is was the sister of my  grandmother. 
Q: Uh-huh, the sister of your grandmother. 
A: Yeah, I think so. 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
10
Q: Mm-hm. Who was in that house that was bombed? 
A: Only them. That™s Œ the people 
Zd u

ska Wola
 extended their 
hospitality to the 
people who came from 
Sieradz
. So the family that came was in different places, 
depends who seen you, or 
who volunteered and so on. 
Q: And from there you went back  to
 Sieradz
? 
A: Oh no, not yet. 
Q: No, okay. 

A: From Œ from there we started to take 
ahead of the Germans.
 Terrible exposure, 
right away people killed, maimed, horses a
nd the deaths Œ those are circumstan ce on 
which my  brother and us separated and co
uldn™t find each  other. And we continued 
that way just ahead of the Germans, til 
Warsaw
. And we went through the 
bombard ment of
 Wa rsa w
, at which point th Œ a Germ
an unit rounded up the men 
and Œ young men and men in general, and wa
s starting to marching them back in the 
direction of
 Lódz. 
Who Œ already in that early date, 
wh o cannot Œ who couldn™t keep 
up, was shot and left on the side of the road in a rainy ditch. My mother and I 
separated. She was on the left ditch, I was 
on the right ditch, in order to facilitate 
faster kind of search, if between the kille
d there is our father, you know, we Œ we 
met the father when  we caught up with Œ w
ith the main group of men. So Œ so, you 
know, it Œ it didn™t finish w
ith that first trek, to 
[indecipherable]
 if anything it was 
an Œ the beginning of a Œ a 
harrowing experience. The pe
ople in one of the places 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
11
were Jews who got the Germans somehow 
to agree to feed the people. I don™t 
reme mb er what Œ what town it was. A co
w was slaughtered and Œ and ev eryone was 
fed, including us, children, fa
mily and so on. And we co
ntinued Œ and I don™t know 
where we continued because I begged a Germ
an soldier to allow my father not to 
continue, with my few words of
 German. I went in the house 
[indecipherable]
 and 
Œ and he allowed my father to stay in one 
of those places as we move on, so I don™t 
know what happened to the main group. Bu
t my father remained
, and that™s when 
we returned to 
Sieradz 
to find the Germans in our h
ouse. That™s when we came to
 
Lódz
 and found ourselves in Œ 
in a get Œ a ghetto life. 
Q: In 
Piotrkowska 
Street. 
A: Yeah. As a ma tter of fact, wh-what™s ha
ppening now, I don™t think th at I Œ that I 
ever put it together in sequence, there 
Œ there are always scraps of memories. 
Q: Well, you just put in sequence, so that™s Œ 
A: And Œ and Œ and here 
you Œ here you Œ you Œ 
Q: Œ this Œ this is perfect. 
A: Œ asked me in sequence, yeah. 
Q: So that™s Œ I Œ I-I think that this is very
 clear now that we have that in sequence Œ 
A: Yes, okay. 
Q: Œ cause this is important. So, probably 
at the end of September, you landed  in the 
Œ 
Ló dz
 in Œ in 
Piotrkowska,
 would you agree with that? 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
12
A: I didn™t read, or I didn™t read much at a
ll, and th ey just gave me Œ so, I wouldn™t 
know. I know that when the gh
etto Œ when the people with 
the ghetto things started, 
and the Germans came, and to
 Œ and to speed up th e proc
ess shot a number of people 
on 
Piotrkowska
, where we were, we didn™t stay around. 
Q: Mm-hm. You were already in
 the ghetto, so that means Œ 
A: No, no, we were
 Œ we were Œ  
Q: Still on the Œ 
A: Œ we moved to th e ghetto, bu
t we were between the first. 
Q: Mm-hm. Because the Œ the creation of th
e ghetto was in Œ arou
nd March of 1940, 
so Œ 

A: Ah, I Œ I thought in Œ I 
thought that maybe we were 
Œ we were there a little bit 
before, I don™t know. 

Q: Mm-hm, okay. And you do reme
mber th e moving to the ghetto? 
A: I remember the moving of
 the ghetto, and things whic
h emanated from Œ my very 
life was sav ed at one point 
because of us staying on
 Piotrkowska
 82. But this is Œ 
this is further in this story. 

Q: Mm-hm. So it™s Œ so, around March of 
1940, you are already 
in the ghetto, right? 
A: Yes. 
Q: Do you recall where yo
u lived in 
the ghetto? 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
13
A: Yes. We first got the house on 
Gniezn nienska
. It will be a handful for you, 
Gniezn nienska
, yeah. 
Gniezn nienska
 Œ wh at language is my  answer? 
Gnieznni Œ 
Gnieznnienska
 29. This was near the wires. We
 were assigned Œ we were assigned 
a room, a one room not heated. Two beds, 
iron beds. And while 
the ghetto was being 
organized, and the houses were
 Œ were given Œ were kind 
of being distributed, wh ich 
again played a role in my Œ another surv ival. Yeah, I was hesitant what I thor Œ 
whatever I would have, because it™s Œ it™
s Œ it™s like cinema
, you know, like Œ like 
something is going to happen, and Œ and Œ 
and in the last minut
e something tu rns Œ 
turns it around. So only when I look at 
it I say, I would hardly  believe so many 
things happening to so many peopl
e. Nevertheless, when I came to
 Israel 
on a Œ on 
a ship, we were maybe a thous
and of boys, we were mo re 
or less, all of us had the 
similar story. Many instances of surviv al against odds. 

Q: So, when you landed at 
Gnieznnienska
, that was your father, your mother and 
you, right? 

A: Yes. 
Q: In this, and you were in 
that room. Do you recall whet
her you went to school at 
all when you lived on 
Piotrkowska
? 
A: I was vaguely  a-aware that there was school
, but I haven™t been  in Œ in th e school 
i-in the ghetto. It™s Œ 
Q: Also, before the ghetto, you were not in school? 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
14
A: N-No, no, definitely not. There 
was only a very short time before Œ 
Q: Right 
A: Œ befo re the ghetto between.  

Q: So, do you recall anything from the earl
y days o-of your life in the ghetto on 
Gnieznnienska
? 
A: Oh yes. Yes, I do remember. T h is was 
not the only address. We had to move and 
move again. We were on
 Zg ierska
, right Œ right near 
the bridge. That™s 
Koscielny
. 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: But we were fortunate because on
 Gn iezn nienska
 there was just a sidewalk and 
the wires 
[indeciphera ble]
 of the ghetto. And we had to 
be careful on th is side of 
the sidewalk. Nobody was walking th
ere, incidentally. Our window was 
[indecipherable]
 out, and also there was Œ there was ice on the walls, and I got 
something which they 
thought is Œ is tuberculosis. 
They checked me out, I didn™t 
have tuberculosis, but we Œ 
we Œ we were transferred in
 some way to that other 
housing on Œ on, I believe numb er Œ 
Zg ierska
 number maybe 40, I™m not sure. A 
small time, for a short period. My 
Œ my  next address after this was 
Rumkowski™s 
house. It was on 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: It was on 
Lagiewnicka. 
A: 
Lagiewnicka [indecipherable]
 
Q: Right, yeah. 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
15
A: Yeah.  
Q: So, what Œ what were Œ were Œ were
 your parents employed, or were you 
employed in the ghetto? 
A: My Œ my f-father was employed,
 but he was getting weaker, and 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: Do you recall where was he employed? 

A: He Œ he Œ he was that la
bor which they had, let™s say 
at one time say they Œ they 
had to oblige people to dig in for potatoes 
for the winter and things like that, as it 
was arriving. This Œ this was a very di
fficult experience for him, for all of us, 
because he felt this was k
illing him, because he knew 
the swelling wa
s going up and 
up, which is very characteristic of the 
way people died  in th
e ghetto, as you know. 
And I Œ I got a job on a 
ko sa
(ph), which means sewing leather things, or wh atever, 
rucksacks and so  on, on 
[indecipherable]
. And Œ and th is Œ this provided en ough 
funds to buy Œ to Œ to
 Œ to pay for our rations or wh
atev er, which was Œ didn™t play 
around, but work ing Œ work in
g I was Œ wh ere I received the soup, which I was able 
to share with my mother. 
Q: And your mo ther Œ your mo ther stayed home? 

A: I Œ I cannot remember my  mo ther being employed outside of home, I didn™t even 
think about that. But was she ever doing so mething? 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
16
Q: So, do you rememb er any Œ 
any contacts with your peers there, other people your 
age in the ghetto, or Œ or you were sp
ending most of the time with the family? 
A: Yesterday I came here to show my family
 they Œ I have grandchildren. They are 
triplets, they are 14 years old now. And Œ 
and Œ and I was trying to get to Œ that™s 
what it is, I am Œ I am being Œ my head is 
being kidnap ped to Œ to  memo ries as I talk 
to you, and all at once, where was I? 
Q: We were Œ 

A: I would Œ I am tal Œ  talking aboutŒ about friends, and because I was here 
yesterday, and Œ and the 
magic happened all at once. I have a number from 
Auschwitz
. It™s the smallest number anyone ev er
 seen, and there is a circumstance 
why the numb er is so miniature it™s hard 
to read. And I say, is this the number, 
B11104
. And it™s one Œ because I couldn™t fi
nd it anywhere when 
I looked for my 
presence in 
Auschwitz
, and Œ and then Œ and the pers
on who was Œ who was helping 
me just did her little magic, a
nd my number ju
mped out from 
Auschwitz 
so 
[indecipherable].
 And Œ and th en I ask, my  very ne
xt thing, to answ er your question 
in a roundabout way, was that 
I was looking for a boy named 
[indecipherable]
 who 
was where I was working on a
 ko sa ,
 the son of Œ of a well-to-do family before the 
war. A small, a 
haseek
(ph), small but fierce, with a 
Œ with a sense of fairness, 
watching 
[indeciphera ble]. 
If he can help it, unfair things will not be happening. He 
came with me when my
 father was Œ when my f Œ moth
er sent some one to say that 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
17
my father is dying, he came with me, he 
stuck with me, I love him. I don™t know 
what happened to him. He wa
s smaller than I, that means I can™t be sure that he was 
killed. I Œ I™ve had Œ I had more Œ more people
, needless to say. In addition to that, I 
got very close to a group of
 pe Œ of youngsters. Thos
e who were in a Œ in an 
orphanag e in the ghetto, a small orphanage. 
[indeciphera ble]
 well, it was on 
[indecipherable]
. It was somewhere in the 
Mary sin,
 and those became my  friends, 
those became the people I have spend my  time on wh ile I was with 
Do ra , Dora  
Fuchs
, as kind of protégée or wh atever you ca
ll it. And have seen her Œ have seen 
them day by day, that they are Œ I reme
mber them all, so me of them I like.  
Q: So this is the Œ so
 going back to the Œ 
A: Yes. 
Q: Œ sol Œ so rt of a recap, your day in 
the ghetto in the beginning was yours and your 
father™s, you would go to your respective wo rks. You would Œ 
A: Yes. 

Q: Œ go to working on 
your sewing machine Œ 
A: Yes. 

Q: Œ in the Œ 

A: Oh, it™s not a machine, it™s two Œ two needles. 
Q: Two needles? 
A: Yes. 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
18
Q: Oh, okay, cause you Œ oh, you said the 
ko sa ,
 I thought of the 
kosa
 was the Œ 
A: 
Kosa  [speaks Polish] 
Q: So you™re a man Œ you have
 quite a good recollections fro
m that time, I can see.  
A: I didn™t know that, but yo
u know, now there is 
nothing else but this team, so yes.  
Q: So Œ and your father st
arted Œ do you recall when Œ 
wh en that was happening, 
when you™re start Œ your father 
started being very weak , and Œ 
A: I Œ til today I don™t have a Œ a good se
nse of days, dates, and things like that. 
Q: Mm-hm. But was it in the summe
r, in the fall, in the winter? 
A: Oh, wh-when my father died? 

Q: Yes. 

A: It was not winter. 
Q: It wasn™t winter.  
A: I remember the clothing in Œ 

Q: That™s what Œ 

A: Œ I didn™t have to wear something, I just went off to 
ko sa
 and Œ and hung with 
him, talked him 
[inaudible] 
Q: So, wh-w hen your Œ wh en
 your father passed away
, was he buried at the 
cemetery? 
A: He was buried at the cemetery. Even tually my  daughter 
Vivian
 here, she Œ she is 
practicing law in
 Israel
 because that™s what she 
wants Œ so, where was I? 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
19
Q: That Œ about the cemetery, the cemeter
y, and you said that
 your daughter is 
practice Œ 
A: Yeah, tha-that Œ that cemeter Œ the ce
meter y , my  d au gh ter came with  me to  
Poden
(ph), and there was, I think, a Professor
 Hirsch
, and he was supported by 
some outfit in Œ from 
Jerusalem
, and the Œ the man in charge was 
Noah Fluke
(ph), 
I don™t know if Œ 

Q: Oh, I know
 N o a h . 
A: Oh, you Œ you know, you know Œ 
Q: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, I know him. 
A: So Œ 

Q: He is Œ he is in charge of the survivors Œ 
A: Yes, yeah. 
Q: Œ organization in 
Israel. 
A: Yes. Anyhow, so Œ so he
 was involved  and my  daughter and I visited for three 

days in 
Poland
, just to look for my  father™s bone
s. At that time, although th e Œ the 
Poles had an organization whic
h they would find the bones 
and send, but mo st of the 
time those were just bones. And Œ but rese
arch was going on, and it was possible 
because when Œ when people were buried, 
th-there was Œ there was a little piece of 
wood put in. Right after the war, while th
e wood was still there undisturbed, some 
people came and put a standardized stone
 on this place with a name, which was a 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
20
stone or Œ or Œ or cement, or wh atever. 
And now it was possible to extrapolate from 
this na Œ the Œ a me Œ by measurement, w
ho was buried, the rest. What Œ wh at was 
the Œ very, very, very sad t-
to Œ to me, because
 when we were looking at those 
books, the people who were entering the books, their handwriting was getting 
slighter and slighter. Not enough strength to 
Œ to Œ to write with 
the Œ with the right 
pressure. So, that™s the time, yeah. 
Q: So the Œ were you able to Œ 

A: No. 
Q: No. So you Œ you haven™
t found this? There is a foundation in the city of 
Ló dz
 Œ 
A: Yes. 
Q: Œ that is Œ that put together
 the new graves in the cemetery. 
A: I Œ I-I Œ I heard about that, yes, and I was in touch for awhile. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: And I took my  daughter so he can co
ntinue the task, if I am not around. 

Q: What Œ what Œ what 
was your father™s name? 
A: 
Shmuel
(ph)
 Klein
. 
Q: 
Shmuel
(ph) 
Klein.
 And your mother™s? 
A: 
Hiya
(ph). 
Q: 
Hiya
(ph). Do you remember h er maiden name? 
A: No. 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
21
Q: Oh, okay. Okay, so that let™s Œ  
A: And my mother™s, I think so mething like 
Feinstein, Eckstein 
or Œ or
 Epstein
. 
And Œ but she lived in
 anoth-nother city. 
Q: Was she Œ was she also from 
Sieradz
, or not? 
A: She had a background in  
Ko nin. 
Q: 
Konin. 
A: But I don™t know if she was born in 
Ko nin.
 I Œ I tried to find her name, and so far 
did not. May I ask you a questi
on which may not relate to the Œ th e particular thing 
that we Œ I am Œ I am looking, an-and in touch with so meone in 
Poland
. In order to 
get the Œ the birthdays, the birthdays of Œ 
of the members of my family, I can™t Œ I 
don™t know when  they died, bu
t they perished in the Holocaust. And I Œ and I want 
to Œ to engrave the na
mes, since I am the only survivor
 and I will be the last th ere, 
but just what I would have done with 
my time during Œ and it™s difficult to get it 
from
 Poland
, talking in 
Zd u

ska  Wola
 when I was looking at the 
Yizkor
 thing 
lately, then 
[indecipherable]
 said the
 Zd u

ska Wola
 people have an 
Yizkor
. But 
there is also a mention th
at they had to go to 
Sieradz,
 which was the capital city, or 
whatever, district city, 
in order to get it, and 
Sieradz
 told him, okay, you Œ you can 
do it for your Jewish community, wh
ich was, if you also do it for the 
Sieradz
 
community. So Œ so  a 
Zd u

ska Wola
 book may now be at a 
[indecipherable]
 but 
it™s slow digging, and I wonder Œ 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
22
Q: We Œ we Œ you know, all the 
Yizkor
 books are available onlin e through th e 
New 
York 
Public Library. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: We also have in our library here, our 
Yizkor
 books, and I know that there is a Œ 
if I recall, it™s Œ there is a separate 
Yizkor
 book for Œ fo r 
Zd u

ska Wola,
 if I recall 
it well. 

A: Y-Y-Yes. 

Q: So, we can Œ we can revisit that, you 
know, aft Œ after our conversation here.  
A: This Œ this is Œ this is my  hope, and 
Œ and a big part of my  mo tivation in coming 
here, that in one of your departments this 
will be possible. I went to the consul and Œ 
and Œ twice in Œ in
 Mon t rea l
, and they tell me that I have
 to fill it o u t in triplicate 
and it will take at least one ye
ar, a-and what is the exact 
spelling, cause they will not 
be able to find. All Œ all those things I didn
™t have available. And I met a consul in a 
social setting later on, I wrote it up, and he sa
ys, yeah, this is Œ this is like a big, big, 

big task. At the same time
, Enjay
(ph), a Œ a new Polish writer, got in touch with me 
about something, he wrote a book. 
Enjay
(ph)
 Vart
(ph), a new promising Po lish 
writer and he said he Œ he loves 
Sieradz
, and if I need something for Œ for him or 
whatever, he will Œ he will go, but I didn™
t want to impose on him, because there 
may be a Œ really a bit of 
work to sort it out. He™s 
[indecipherable]
 book, I believe 
[indecipherable]
  

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
23
Q: Mm-hm, yes, yeah, he is Œ 
A: It™s on the way to 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: He is a Œ quite a well known author these days. 
A: Yeah, I don™t know if Œ he is so modest, like. 
Q: Yeah. But I-I think that this is Œ it™s qu
ite possible to Œ to ge
t that information  
A: Yeah, that will Œ I will be grateful Œ 
Q: And I would suggest Œ I would suggest that
 we deal with this 
when we finish our 
conversation Œ 
A: Great. 
Q: Œ here, and th e Œ the Œ I™m pretty su
re that we can help
 somehow, through 
whatever resources we have here in the mu
seum, but also with Œ with Œ we have a 
very good contact with 
Œ with our colleagues in 
Lódz 
and the surrounding area, 
including 
Konin, 
etcetera. 
A: I Œ I hope for it, to Œ to give you a 
picture of me now, I am a heart patient. I 
cannot get health insuranc
e. But being a heart patient doesn™t stop me from 
windsurfing Œ 

Q: Oh. 

A: Œ together with the youngsters, and so 
on. But at the same time, once you have a 
look at the number of operations or medicati
ons that I am taking that Œ that keeps me 
active, I™d say you don™t want to insure. 
The only exception in 
11 years, was to  

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
24
come here. And that™s Œ I did it when all 
my  family was around me with definite 
instruction that no resuscita
tion, no de Œ no Œ bu-but I am here, and Œ and I cannot 
count on Œ on endless 
[indecipherable]
 endless unreliability of me, yeah. So, if I Œ 
anything I can get, I will be grat
eful. It™s a sp ecial circumstance. 
Q: Definitely we Œ we can revisit that
 when  Œ when  we Œ when  Œ after our 
conversation here. 
A: Sure. 

Q: So the Œ this is the Œ but it Œ this is qu
ite, I must say, uplifting, what you just said, 
that, with your windsurfing and all that thi
ng. I wish that we all did such an active 

life Œ lead active life. Going b
ack to the Œ to the ghetto. 
A: Yes. 
Q: So, when your fa
ther passed away Œ 
A: Yes. 
Q: Œ you still continued working in
 the Œ in that leather shop? 
A: Sure. 
Q: And you Œ you became the only 
provider at that time, right? 
A: Yes.  

Q: And your mo ther, how did she take? 
A: My mother was like Œ there was unlimite
d good will, but Œ on her part, but Œ but 
she was frail. And Œ and wh en
 Œ when even
tually the 
aktion
 of 1942 took place in 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
25
the ghetto, at that time we had to  go to  the 
Œ to the yard, and they  were checking the 
apartments to make sure th
at they are empty. And Œ a
nd once they  Œ once they  do Œ 
do th at, and after separating children from 
grownups, taking aw ay a number of the 
grownups, my mother wasn™t to
 be found any more. So, but Œ 
Q: So, she was taken during the 
[indecipherable]
 
A: She was taken, but we kn
ew where she was taken and 
[indecipherable]
 to 
Argenietska
(ph) 34 - 36, I decided to join her. 
Took our bread rations
 that we had, I 
ca Œ teared off a bread for th
e two of us, and ha Œ whic
h was the possession you take 
with you, or Œ or to give it 
to her, or whatever. She was in
 the window on the second 
floor, I saw her. And a feat I couldn™t 
duplicate ever since, whenever I see 
something that will be thrown 
directly on Œ in this directi
on, can I do it? I threw the 
bread and it came straight into  her, and Œ and I 
[indecipherable]
 and she was 
worrying what will happen, 
talking to another woman, 
I heard every word. What 
will happen to 
Adusha
(ph)? I was 
Adusha
(ph), a diminutive. Bu t what Œ what Œ 
Q: At that time you were 16 years old, 16 or 15, right? 
A: Yeah. I Œ I was Œ 
Q: So you were not take
n to Œ with Œ with  the other children, right? 

A: My Œ the Œ th-the wife of my uncle from 
Poganica 
was in the ghetto in Œ in the Œ 
in those listings of pop Œ and mo vement
s of population and so  on. And I had a 
cousin my  age, approximately, and I Œ we
 were Œ we were Œ we were changing 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
26
dates. He was changing our dates all over 
the place, til I Œ til I got complicated with 
those dates, and Œ and used
 the date which is convenient. And it bothered me, 
because you know, like some
times you have to say 
[indecipherable]
 and I wish that 
I rather wouldn™t be asked, and only after 
searching til I myself wa
s this Œ searching, 
I Œ I Œ I knew that I can extrapolate, ho Œ 
wh -when did I go to  school, and wh en did 
I this Œ so I narrow it down to
 20 Œ 26 or 27, those Œ thos
e two years, and Œ and then, 
because I Œ I also had the Œ a larger differe
nce at the time which 
I was using, have Œ 
have documents, have life insu
rance on that and 
so on. And people
 told me just 
nobody is interested in your
 exact age, but Œ but I felt unc
omfortable. So I am started 
thinking about now finally. 
Q: Mm-hm. So, have you ev er tried 
to find your birth certificate in 
Sieradz
? 
A: No. 

Q: Or in the Œ I Œ I don™t know for a 
fact whether any records of the Jewish 
community Œ 

A: And it Œ it will Œ it will be Œ 
Q: Œ exist there. 
A: Œ I Œ I do Œ I don™t even know if May the 30
th
 is an invented date or a real date. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: It didn™t help that at home somehow we
 didn™t celebrate birthdays or wh atever. 
Q: Wa-Was your family religi
ous at all, or completely Œ 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
27
A: In 
Mizrachi,
 a couple of times a year. 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: My grandfather had a white beard. He 
was in the city, I be
lieve, like for a time, 
counselor or whatever. Spoke
 Polish. It was quite a circus, because this is the 
obviously Jewish man with a 
kippa h
 around head, open ing up in the middle of 
Yiddish, and Œ and so on. An
d Polish to his different customers, and Œ and turning to  
me and Œ and talking in
 literary Polish, yeah. 
Q: And you reme Œ tha-that™s your 
recollection from the pre-war time from
 
Sieradz? 
A: Yeah.  
Q: That™s quite a Œ so, back in the ghetto
, so do you recall 
how far before the 
gaspara
(ph), the Œ the September ™42, be
fore your father passed away? 
A: Yes. Do I remember? 

Q: Yeah, how far before that? 

A: Oh, all Œ all the time, but at Œ at the ve
ry beginning of Œ of the Œ of the ghetto, 
there was optimism. We surv
ived the shootings and the 
ho using s
 and so on. There 
was enough food. Dark br
ead, very heavy, oil, e
nough oil. Some kind of a 
kashatsing
(ph), and Œ and a biting optimism that th
e war is Œ is just about to finish. 
And ther Œ there were no work, no factories 
organize yet, nothing.
 There was leisure. 
But there were cultural evenings, a
nd Œ and the cultural evenings, every 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
28
neighborhood Œ every neighb
orhood had th e Œ had, you 
know, displaying whoever 
they can, so meone on an instrument, or 
someone this. I was pushed to read my 
poetry, so I did. It™s Œ later on, it saved my  life. 
Q: Do you Œ do you rememb e
r, or do you Œ were you ab le 
to recreate any of your 
poetry? 

A: I Œ I Œ I was asked so many Œ there was 
be-bef-before Œ before the war there was 

[indecipherable]
 or something, a newspaper, which also has a section fo r the 
young, and for teenagers, or whatever. 
So I was a couple of time published there. 
And Œ and I reme mb er this be
tter, but in Œ in the ghetto, 
I didn™t know what I was 
writing, but the adults made the 
[indeciphera ble]
 to what I was writing, and they 
made Œ th-they made like that they were th
inking about that, as simple as there is, 
there is a peasant and Œ and he Œ he seed 
Œ seeds of all kind of things. When  those 
seeds grow up 
[indecipherable]
 this particular evil, a gardener and Œ and that Œ 
well, you know, it™s Œ it™s things like that. 

Q: Do you recall any of your po
ems from that time? Can you say Œ 
A: Oh, I™m Œ I™m Œ 

Q: Œ I Œ you can say it in Polish. 

A: Œ I am glad to forget them, because Œ 
because this was my ticket, that™s what Œ 
what kind of separated me from Œ from what
ever, you know, like in
 school still, just 
Œ that™s what it was. A t Œ but I Œ I wrote 
spontaneously, I read and wrote before th e 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
29
age of five, the age of five, just not 
learning formally, only readin g Œ reading 
whatever I could on the street, or wherev
er. So, there will be expectation. It was 
getting quiet in the house when I was writing. 
Skindis
(ph) 
schiven
(ph), you know, 
I-I am going to this. And Œ and I Œ I Œ I wrot
e for to make an impression. And Œ and 
Œ and I thought the time just I d on™t feel 
much, and that it™s phony and Œ and later 
when  Œ when a language had to be changed, 
I once, twice, three times, I Œ I seized Œ 
I seized wri ting. But I have a Œ like ev
erybody, sometimes ev
erybody who is not 
educated, I have a creative streak, and th
at™s how I made a li-living. And Œ and 
design of automation sy stems, things wh ich do
n™t exist yet. So Œ so I say yes, we Œ 
maybe every child is creative til public
 schooling knocks it out of him. 
Q: But you Œ do you think that any of 
your writings surviv ed
 in the Œ in the 
published fo rm in the pre-wa
r time you said about this 
Ze v
(ph) 
Nuardik
(ph) Œ 
A: Yeah, yeah Œ 
Q: It™s the Œ 

A: I Œ I Œ I don™t know if he Œ I am co
ming from a town where people were born, 
they had s Œ they grew up, they  had child
ren, they had grandchildren, with an 
unfulfilled ambition, life
time amb ition to visit 
Lódz
 60 kilometers away. You know, 
so some Œ some of that thinking, can 
something be taking out from a stack of 
newspapers which were Œ wh
ich Œ which was done Œ it w
ould be nice. I Œ I wonder 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
30
how I would feel about Œ no, at that time, I was Œ I was writing because I felt like it, 
and the resu lts were there. But later on I Œ I Œ 
Q: In the ghetto you were writing just to please Œ 

A: Y-Yes. In Œ in the ghetto that™s how I 
survived, because of th
at. I will be able to 
relate to you Œ 

Q: Can you be mo re specific a
bout this, cause i Œ you referred 
[indecipherable]
 
A: Y-Yeah, and it will also Œ i-it will also
 maybe fit the narration of Œ of what 
happened . On 
Piotrkowska
 82, there was a Œ there was a family, their name was 
Krikos
(ph), and she was a fashion designer, a 
known one, with in
ternational ties, 
travels to 
[indeciphera ble]
 and so on. Her husband was 
taken away and killed in a 
prison. She remained alone and my  father 
and I, my mother, were there helping her 
with anything we could. I was Œ I was maki
ng sure that she has enough wood fo r the 
fireplace and things like that. Although it Œ 
it was just the beginning of the need of 
the wood. In the Œ in the gh
etto, we met at the beginnin
g and Œ an d then all at once 
everything got to be a problem, distance 
was a problem, time, 
energy mostly was a 
problem, and so  on. Bu t she 
maintained Œ maintained cont
act with us, and aware to 
what™s going on in our lives
. She herself worked as one of the fashion designers or 
manager in a 
Beschen
(ph) Œ 
Beschen
(ph) 
Kleider
 factory, one of six 
Beschen
(ph) 
and 
Kleider
 factories. Now, when Œ when I br
ought the bread to 
my  mo th er an d  I 
gave it to her, a Jewish policeman grabbed 
me, took me into Œ into an  entrance of 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
31
the house across 
Lagiewnicka
 and he beat me up. I was 
not supposed to be outside 
on th e street. And now I think maybe he sa
ved my life at that time, because if I 
would join them, I would be 
gone. But anyhow, it™s Œ I wa
s very humiliated. I think 
this what hurt the most. And in the middl
e of the night, I went to Œ to M-Mrs. 
Krikosava
(ph) where she lived in 
Mary sin
. A-And I told  her wh at happened , and 
can she either li Œ arrange for me to join 
my  mo ther, or Œ or get my  mo ther out of 
that transport. I didn™t hear mu ch Œ mu
ch about that, but wh
en  my  mo th er was 
taking away, this was Œ this was my Œ oh, I t 
Œ I didn™t feel that Œ that I want to go 
on, especially. I wouldn™t spend energy, I di
dn™t have ener Œ I didn™t go for my  bread 
ration, wh ich is once in 10 days or someth
ing, wh ich means death, dying, not Œ no Œ 
and di Œ she appeared. And she took me to he
r office as a runner, in order to have a 
soup a day, and to su rvive Œ 
to survive on that
 soup or whatever til Œ til the Œ til the 
time comes for the regular allocation of
 food. And now Œ no
w my  story gets 
interesting, because as I was there, there 
was an inspection by th
e chief engi Œ by the 
chief of the 
Bescher
(ph) and 
Kleider
. To tell you also thatwhen we came to the 
ghetto, th ere was some body who was distri
buting the apartments. T h e one who was 
the manager of our area was a name by the name of 
Bolek
(ph) 
Yako bovitch
(ph). 
Bolek
(ph) 
Ya kobo v i tch
(ph) was now Œ was now in ch ar
ge of those factories, and Œ 
and 
Bolek
(ph) 
Ya kobo v itch
(ph) is the one who entered, and he stopped near me, 
and kind of, I thought accusingl
y, he is ask me how do 
I Œ what do I know you f-

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
32
from? And I say, from the cu ltural evenings, because he 
was attending. So he Œ he 
went ahead and I thought he is going to
 throw me out, he knows that this is 
fictitious, me being there, and eating the soup. But 
Krikosava
(ph) followed, and 
together with other people, the manager, and 
she smiled to me, th
at me said nothing 
bad happened. And this continued for, I don™
t know, two or three days. After Œ after 
which, the 
droshka
(ph) firm with 
Rumko wski
 with the white horse, stopped in the 
front of th e building, they calle
d me out and they took me to 
Balucki Rynek
. And 
Balucki Rynek
 was sitting 
Rumkowski
, and on both  side female secretaries and 
people, and so on, and Œ an
d a Œ and th ey kind of Œ 
Rumkowski
 a-asked me a few 
word s, and the other people, and I z Œ I saw 
Anodinka
(ph), the head, and I am being 
taken to the house of
 Rumko wski
, which was divided into  four apartments. And in 
apartment number one, 
was the apartment for 
Dora Fuchs
. That™s the first time I 
learned about anybody like 
D o ra  F u ch s
. 
Rumkowski
, everybody sign Œ sings Œ 
Dora  Fuchs
 was very often doing the things that  they complained 
about, and that 
Rumkowski
 fought against, but th is wasn™t k
nown publicly, this I learned later. And 
Bernard Fuchs
, her brother, wh o died in 
Connecticut 
just a few years ago, his wife 
is still alive, 
Irena
.  
Q: We Œ we do have an  interview with Œ 
with him. You know, 
we conducted Œ he Œ 
he went by the name
 Bert Fleming. 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
33
A: 
Bert Œ Bert Œ Bert Fleming,
 yes, he found me. He 
found me when I was in 
Florida
 at one time, an-and – 
Q: Okay, I™m sorry. 
A: He Œ he married
 Ire n a 
at that time, and a place became available for me. And 
this was in 
Dora ™s
 Œ in Œ in Œ in  
Do ra ™s 
apartment. So, althou
gh the house was Œ it 
was a sma ll  house, 
Rumkowski
, 
Jusef
(ph) 
Rumkowski
, 
Eric Yakobovitch
 
down stairs, 
Dora
 downstairs.
 Eric Yakobovitch 
had another house in 
Mary sin
, so 
did 
Rumkowski
, or whatever. So, I was given the place, my clothes were thrown 
away for a good reason. And 
people came to  take measu rements for my shoes, for 
my  pajama s, for my  this, and so on. And all at once there was a Œ a Œ there was a Œ 

food, and Œ and Œ and Œ and books. A
nd th at™s how I came, because of 
Bolek
(ph) 
being this Œ 
Rumkowski
 has given out a di-directive, I think, to the ones who are 
well-off in the ghetto should
 Œ should adopt one of th
e Œ one of the children, 
orphans, who remained orphans at that time.
 Dora
 was very much Œ very much 
aware of wh at™s the tone to give to hersel
f and to her persona, and I was part of it, 
except I was in the house. In r
eality, I was mostly upstairs with 
Rumkowski,
 
because there was a boy there, 
Stanislaw Stein
(ph), not many people know ab out 
him, and wh en I heard the story wh at happened to 
Rumko wski
 when he went to the 
camp. They say that he Œ a brunette wo
man, younger woman, and a teenage boy, 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
34
black hair, was on th at open wagon, so I kn
ow yes, this mu st be the right version 
because this was 
Stanislaw,
 who wanted to  come with 
Rumko wski. 
Q: Who was Œ who was 
Stanislaw,
 who was he? 
A: 
Stanislaw? 
He™s a Œ he™s a Œ his parents were 
dead, he Œ he was Œ he was a very 
quiet guy Œ 
Q: Was he your age? 

A: Œ I was his only friend, I think. Pardon? 

Q: He was your age? 
A: He was younger. 
Q: Younger. 

A: And Œ and he had the Bar 
Mitzvah, as a matter of fact
, at the beginning of 1944. 
Q: ™44. 

A: But things happen ed Œ happened in th
e meantime, and I Œ I did Œ that™s not the 
first time that I did a self destructive thing, 
but I also did it at that time. It™s Œ it™s Œ 
it™s a small item, but it™s important becaus
e it took my train sideways towards not 
surviving. And this was when 
I Œ the first time when Œ when 
Do ra
 came home from 
work , the same day, she passed without 
looking, she passed into her room. The 
housekeeper brought a box of bonbons, and 
she said that I am a very nice boy, but 
she wants Œ she wants to note that she™s 
a very busy person, 
and she doesn™t have 
any time away from her work. So it was Œ 
that means this Œ I didn™t understand 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
35
exactly what it was, but there was food, a
nd there was Œ and later Œ but Œ but I had 
my idea with her moral Œ 
Q: So Œ 

A: Œ mo re Œ mo re because she was 
such a good pretender. I™m sorry? 
Q: So you Œ she Œ officially she wa
s the one who adopted you, right? 
Dora  Fuchs. 
A: It Œ it was never clear. It was floating in the air.  

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: It was not Œ officially, I was sleeping in
 her place. Our Œ our lessons, the teacher, 
lunches and so on, were 
Œ were in upstairs in 
Rumko wski™s
 study. When  years, 
years later I was in 
Tel Aviv
, and there was an exhibition of things from the ghetto, 
and Œ and I recognized some of the things
, and I said, I have never been to the 
Tel 
Aviv
 Un iversity Museum of Œ of whatever, so
 how can it be that I say I have been 
here? No, I haven™t been  there. So Œ but then I reme mb er. Every time 
Stanislaw
 and 
I, we had to have our lessons
, he would Œ he would Œ we 
would have to take off the 
table all kind of gift that 
Rumkowski
 was getting all the time. Ta Œ they sang 
[indecipherable]
 to him, he Œ he Œ he was the gr
eatest man in history. I Œ I think 
that there are very few peop
le in the world who can with
stand endlessly that kind of 
flattery. With engravings, with here and ther
e. We had to  take off that things almo st 
en masse, and put it Œ put it on the side to 
have place to do our le
ssons in his study. 
And we don™t know if somebody put it back 
for his attention or not. No, it was Œ it 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
36
was a job by itself just to follow Œ a Œ a por
trait of his would hang on the wall, and Œ 
and a little item would be there, and the Œ th
e rest was a big accumulation. So our Œ 
our teachers were Dr. 
Rabiner
(ph) 
Berliner
(ph) from Œ from Œ from doctor Œ Dr.
 
Rabiner
(ph) 
Berliner
(ph) from Œ a Œ a place in germa Œ 
Hannover
, maybe. I™m Œ 
I™m not sure. Dr. 
Rabiner
(ph)
 Berliner
(ph), he said that his wife has her dates til 
this from the Spanish Inquisition still, his wi
fe has a Œ this is Œ there was somebody 
from the Œ 

Q: So what Œ what was he
 teaching you, the Œ the Dr. 
Berliner
(ph)? 
A: Logic, math, German, things like that. 
They were Œ they were a Œ a calibr Œ a 
caliber which is th Œ which is that they 
should have the graduate students there. 
What we are studying was very Œ he was a
pplying himself like to everything. He 
was applying himself, he was solid. 

Q: So 
Stasiu k
(ph) was Œ was he Œ he was adopted by 
Rumkowski
? 
A: He was eventually adopte
d, because in my case, my  mo ther was taken away , but 
couldn™t say that my mother is dead. This 
Œ in the ghetto we 
didn™t know, and the 
people who knew, knew. This is number one.
 Number two, I will 
get it off my Œ my 
mind, but there was when 
Œ wh en Mrs. Œ when the 
Fuchses
 Œ the father 
Fuchs 
was a 
tailor, when Œ when the 
Fuchses
 came Œ came to Œ to 
Lódz, 
to the ghetto, a family 
took care of them. And th
-the family, this was 
Fryman
(ph), and th ey provided 
work , lodgings and so on fo r them. Wh
en th ey  moved to the ghetto, Mrs. 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
37
Fryman
(ph), Mr. 
Fryman
(ph) and 
Dora  Fuchs
 and her father were there, and Œ and 
those were the people who came with them
, and were part of the people. And to Œ 
just to be converted very, 
very quickly and forcefully 
into being the housekeeper, 
into being like the maid and so on. She of
ten cried, and I often talked to her. I was 
still not to familiarize with 
the help, but Mrs. Œ Mrs. 
Fryman
(ph) went to a doctor, 
and she had to go to a doctor maybe
 because she didn™t want that 
Do ra
 should know 
that she went to a doctor at all, you know.
 And there was a louse, and she was bitten, 
and she had Œ and she had 
Fleck Œ 
Q: Typhus. 
A: Œ 
Fleck
 typhus, yes. 
Q: Right. 
A: Now, what happened at that time, sa
id Œ this had t-to be announced to the 
Germans, and it was Œ 
when it was told to 
Beebow
(ph), 
Krieger
 was their mark, 
Krieger 
was there, and Œ and he tried to re
model it and says, oh, this is Mrs.
 
Fryman
(ph) from 
[indecipherable]
 or something. He says, she™s 
[indecipherable]
 
for Frau 
Fryman
(ph). And now many people were
 work ing Germans on the boats 
here 
[indecipherable]
 and they  were Œ and they were 
Baltic
 Germans, they were not 
very clean very often. And 
Do ra
 was afraid if anybody 
[indeciphera ble]
 sick, that 
will get back to her. And sh e started an or
gy of dressmaking. 
All kinds of dress Œ 
ever Œ everything had to be cr
isp, crisp, white colors and 
so on, in order to project 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
38
that meticu lous, meticulous, meticulous
 freshness and Œ and cleanliness. People 
didn™t understand wh at was the whole thi
ng, but I knew because I from inside the 
house. Not the end of 
the story because Mrs.
 Fryman
(ph) was getting worse and 
worse, and Œ and even tually was dying. And 
Dora
 says that God had her 
[indecipherable]
. God Œ God Œ God punish her for th
e problems she Œ she did Œ she 
Œ she did to me. And I Œ I couldn™t look
 at her after that. This was Œ I was 
pretending, but Œ but I was defensive. 

Q: So Mrs.
 Fryman
(ph) and Œ and her husband, they  were in 
Lódz
. 
A: They were in 
Lódz. 
Mr. 
Fryman
(ph), I once saw him in a bus passing by in 
Tel 
Aviv . 
He wouldn™t be alive now. He
 married the housekeeper of
 Eric Ya ko bov itch. 
Eric Yakobovitch 
was in charge of all the Œ a ll the industry in the ghetto. 
Q: So Mr. 
Fryman
(ph) survived. 
A: Mist Œ Mr. 
Fryman
(ph) survived, yes. Nice, quiet man. 
Q: We will stop for a second Œ 

A: Sure 
Q: Œ to ch ange. 
[break] 
Q: It™s quite a story. I-It Œ we are Œ we
 are okay now? Oh ok
ay, we can contin ue. 
A: Well Œ 

Q: So what Œ if Œ wh at was your, if you 
can recall to put it in some kind of a frame 
after Œ this is after the 
gaspara
(ph), right? 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
39
A: Yes. 
Q: So it would be probably in th e what? 
October 1942 or some Œ somehow like this, 
right? 
A: Yes, ™42 was Œ 
Q: That you started living in Œ in 
Rumkowski™s
 apartment. 
A: Yes, in Œ in his house.  
Q: And were you Œ at that time you were not work ing any mo re in the Œ in th e 

leather factory, are you Œ 
A: Not in the leather factory, bu t this was ac-across from Œ from dev Œ
 
Dewczewska
(ph) was 
Lagiewnicka
 
[indecipherable] 
the Œ that™s where Œ where 
you will Œ as yesterday I got my 
Lagiewnicka
 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: Yeah. 
A: And with  
Vivian Œ 
Q: We Œ we Œ you Œ you noticed probably  
that we have a door, original door from 
that building in the exhibition. 
A: No-no Œ no, no, no, I didn't notice. I Œ I 
haven™t explored yet, and I Œ I doubt that 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: Oh, so we™ll have to Œ after the inte
rview we™ll go downstairs and I™ll sh-show 
you. 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
40
A: And the Œ the Œ th e next Œ th e Œ the ne
xt thing is the Œ the television is quite 
successful with the lives of the rich and th
e famous and things like that. Well, there 
were the rich and the famous in the ghetto, 
but they were not exac
tly the people that 
one expected they 
were. Even it was 
Stasiuk
(ph) and I, and 
Ma rish a
(ph)
 
Mazur
(ph), a daughter of Œ of a doctor, woul
d be Œ would be coached by Mrs. Dr. 
Eliasburg
(ph), in th ings like rhythmic. Like
, she would play the piano and we 
would go with sticks, and th in
gs like that. This was Œ this 
was in the ghetto as part of 
Œ of they  consid ered the Œ the Œ the right 
thing to  do and so on, and it was Œ it was 
kind of mindless, but what 
may be a surprise is that 
Rumkowski™s
 house was 
modest. His Œ his wife was Œ was nice, 
intelligent. Well, no matter how she was 
coming thro ugh, I only saw with Œ not from 
Helena Rumkowski
, who was a 
battleaxe, but she was a Œ a Œ she was Œ I th
 Œ I think that they were going to  the 
dentist, Dr.
 Smolowicz
(ph), or 
Stolowicz
(ph), who was a man who had a Œ a radio 
in the ghetto, which I didn™t find out til 
Bernard Fuchs
 have Œ have to located me, 
and said Œ said an interview here, a kind 
of, you know, people didn™t understand. I Œ 
I told him, what do you expect? You kick  pe ople. So  he went ahead, run ahead of his 
wife and I, you know, to live w
ith that, that I came. He want
ed me to say that he was 
a nice person. He had nice Œ some of th
e nice qualities, some of them not, and I 
wasn™t shy in telling him, he
 shouldn™t be surprised why 
people saw what they  saw 
and reacted to what he saw. And he
 better lives with that, he did. 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
41
Q: Going back to 
Ma rish a
(ph)
 Ma zu r
(ph) Œ 
A: Yes. 
Q: Œ the third person, she was Œ how did 
she get into that 
apartment? She was 
adopted by someone as well th
ere, or she was just Œ 
A: Oh, th at Œ that 
Ma rish a
(ph) 
Ma zu r
(ph)? No, she was Œ she 
were Œ only came for 
the Œ 

Q: For the tutoring. 

A: For th e tutoring, yeah. And of Œ of Œ of 
this Œ of this thing. N-Not tutoring in 
anything else. Her father was a known spec
ialist which was brou Œ brought into  the 
ghetto from
 Warsaw
 in order to take care of 
Rumkowski™s 
conditions. So mething 
lara Œ laran 
[indecipherable]
. There Œ there was Œ 
Dora Fuchs
 was doing like big 
dinners where I had to read my poetry, that 
I didn™t feel like writing, and I didn't feel 

anything; but this was it, now it was me, I 
was sitting next to her, and th e time was 
coming traditionally to me. And of course, I di
dn™t matter at all. At one time Œ at one 
time, and Œ and I say it because
 m Œ because it Œ it Œ it will be so uncharacteristic of 
what people think. In th e evening, one even ing, 
Gertler
 is coming. Strutting 
Gertler
 
was the head of the police. And he is st
rutting in and the two people Œ the three 
people outside, because there was already 
Gingka
(ph), who was also coming to  help 
out in th e household. There were only th
ree people in th e household. There were Œ 
there were only at Œ mo st of the time, two people, 
Do ra
 and I. And he comes in and 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
42
Œ and he Œ they started to bring in c
hocolate, and or-or-o
ranges, newspapers, 
cognacs, and all kind of drinks like that. 
Dora 
is going,
 Eric Yakobovitch 
and the Œ 
the brother
, Bolek
(ph) 
Ya kobo v i tch
 wouldn™t fit, he wasn™t on the right level. So
 
Beebow
(ph) comes in, and mean
time, while waiting for
 Beebow
(ph), 
Dora
 is 
asking Œ asking 
Gertler
, 
Dawid
, how did you manage it? And he opens this, and he 
says, inspector for the Gestapo. This was Œ this was 
Dawid Gertler
, he was going 
around giving people somethin
g to eat, or whatever, and 
he was considered like an 
extraordinary fine person. Bu
t I know that people were killed all the time becau se of 
him, and he knows what™s going on he
re. I know about what was written on his 
papers, because he 
[indecipherable]
 a very valuable, or extraordinary valuab le Jew, 
something like that. He had a nice wife, he
 adopted  two small children, and he tried 
to be a 
rubaszny,
 that will 
[indecipherable]
 of 
Euro pe
. 
Q: The 
rubaszny [indecipherable] 
A: Y-Yeah, ki-kind of. A-And Œ 
and so he Œ it Œ h-he said 
[indecipherable]
 it was a 
Œ the din of out Œ and he said that he has a 
balia,
 a container for water, for a tub, a 
tub fo r th Œ with swimming fish
 outside, okay, but this he
 didn™t bring in to the living 
room. And 
Beebow
(ph) was feeding me pieces of orange and Œ a-and so  on. So , this 
was Œ this was the Œ all those things were
 heard upstairs, because there were only a 
few stairs. Windows were open, a truck pulls up, 
Rumko wski
 is in the house, and 
all this was done under his nose. Having nose to Œ to 
Rumkowski
. And 
Do ra
 raised  

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
43
her voice and said 
wir werden Œ wir werden dem alten gar nicht geben. 
We will 
not give anything to  the old on
e. Anyhow, he says that all 
this is mine, all this is 
mine, everything is mi ne, and so  on. 
Q: So Œ 
A: This was for me an illustration about a Œ a Œ 
Rumko wski 
part of the time was 
helpless, and the things were done by a 
clique. And they allo
wed him to go around 
and Œ and get the darts thrown at the pe
ople who make hunger and everything. But 
he, on the contrary, I Œ I Œ I know from he
aring, because even if there was Œ there 
was a 
[indecipherable]
 
Rumkowski™s
 courage, y-you know, in situation which 
were dangerous to him, very dangerous to 
him, and Œ and nevertheless, he followed  
through, he put his life on Œ on line. 

Q: So, cou Œ could you 
explain little bit more about that 
truck that came, so that was 
a Œ a Œ wh ile the Œ the party was going on in th e 
Rumkowski™s
 apartment, the truck 
pulled to  take the patients out of 
the hospital, or Œ what was the Œ 
A: No, no. Oh, you Œ y
ou Œ with  the truck? 
Q: Right. 
A: No, th e truck was brought by 
Gertler
 from
 Warsaw
 Œ 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: Œ with things which were not 
available even for the Germans. 
Q: Uh-huh, oh, okay, mm-hm. 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
44
A: This was probably his bonus because he
 brought many rich Jews probably to 
their deaths, you know, and 
[indecipherable]
. So Œ so, 
Rumko wski
 was excluded. 
To me, I didn™t have to Œ at Œ at one time, 
an d this I will not forget either, there was 
Œ there was Œ people were saying at the tabl
e, said, the Germans have left a ghetto, 
maybe 
Kovno
, maybe 
Rovno
, I don™t remember exactly, and they left the Jews 
intact. Now, we kind of had a feeling, I had a feeling that I™m not going to live, 
around the corner there is death. I couldn™t
 get rid of that feeling, that death is 
waiting around the Œ but Œ but 
probably the Œ that
 means, like they
 killed the Jews 
before they leave the ghetto? One way or 
another, it Œ it Œ it was Œ this what came 
around. And people were talking about that
, and continue with their dinner, with 
their 
galareta,
 with all those things that
 Dora
 was preparing; preparing Œ th at she 
made to be prepared. 

Q: So Œ but
 Rumkowski
 was not part of that feast? 
A: He was Œ he was Œ he was not a part of 
it, but in this case, in the afternoon, I 
waited outside my house because 
Gertler
 said that he is going to  buy me a bike. 
According to the historical 
book nobody had a bike. I had a bike. It Œ it™s Œ so Œ so 
the room Œ yeah, 
Rumko wski
 comes in and gets out of his 
doro
*
ka
 and he grabs 
me by Œ by the 
[indecipherable]
 and he swirls me  around him. He Œ he is radiant 
with happiness. He Œ he Œ he walks strai
ght. He Œ he shed 20 years off, when I saw 
him at that time. Later in 
the evening I heard about Œ 
about the Jews remaining Œ 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
45
remaining alive, following which days late
r, we knew that it was Œ it wasn™t true, 
that the Germans didn™t leave Jews
 alive, but at that time Œ but 
Rumkowski
 was del-
de-delirious with happiness that Œ that the 
chances that the Jews were Œ and th e other 
people in the ghetto Œ 
Q: Tho-Those were the Jews 
who were departed during th e 
gaspara
(ph), right? 
A: Pardon? 
Q: Those were the Jew Œ he was happy 
because he learned that the Jews Œ 

A: No, it said Œ said Œ said 
the Germans are likely to leave 
Lódz
 ghetto alone, okay, 
and not kill the people, okay. That was th
e big thing. But the people who were 
sitting at 
Dora™s
 dinner, with me in attendance as 
well w ith, th-they Œ they Œ they Œ 
they didn™t Œ they were not Œ y-you know, 
th-they were not moved. No Œ no one was 
happy that they were talkin
g about the ranks within th e ghetto, th e Œ the different 
levels of career, res-res-resonsi Œ responsi
bilities and Œ and this, 
they Œ they did not 
care.
 Rumkowski
 cared. Okay, there was 
no doubt in my  mind that he cared. There 
is no doubt in my  mind that he Œ he was 
a demigod. There was no one that Œ that he 
was Œ that he was on a extraordinary e
go trip. Most of the time he pretended. 

[indecipherable]
 because you know, you 
Œ you had to  throw the 
fear in th Œ into 
them. What Œ but actually he was Œ after the Œ the Œ the 
[indecipherable]
 there was 
a situation that people had to say to Œ 
who worked there, had to say send less food 
because there are le
ss people in the ghetto, becaus
e they were already Œ well, 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
46
Rumkows Œ and no one wanted to sign, or
 whatever, which had to be signed. And 
Rumkowski
 volunteered, and he signed, an d he
 was beaten up fo r that, but he 
survived just the same. 
Q: So do Œ do you rememb er instances when
 Rumkowski
 would come from the 
meetings with the Germans and be beaten up? 

A: No.  

Q: No. 

A: Re Œ because in the ev
ening, I wasn™t any more 
[indecipherable]
 ask me about 
what they ate on Friday, 
I forgot about that – 

Q: Wh-W h-What did someone ask you wh at Œ wh at they were eating on Frid ay? 

A: The 
Rumkowski Œ 
on Friday, I said usual, only to
 remember later, to remember 
that actually I wasn™t ther
e on Friday night. This is
 Œ the distance is kind of 
telescoping and Œ and 
[indecipherable]
 so actually, I wasn™t th
ere at night, at night I 
was ac Œ ac Œ exhibited at 
Dora™s
, so Œ now Œ but Œ 
Q: Oh, so tho-tho-those were the evenin
gs wh ere you had to recite her poetry. 
A: Ye-Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

Q: On Friday evenings. 

A: Poe Œ po Œ poetry, yes. I wa Œ I 
was Œ how mu ch time has passed? Pardon? 
Q: One hour and a half. 

A: Oh. 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
47
Q: But it is quite interesting what yo
u are saying, so if you don™t mind? 
A: Yes. 
Q: It™s Œ 

A: Yeah, sure, sure.  
Q: Let™s continue. 
A: I will Œ ye-yeah. It™s Œ it Œ we are Œ 

Q: Would you Œ would you like to take a 
break, because if Œ if you would like to 
take a break, we could Œ 
A: No, I Œ I am fine. If you Œ if you see me
 kind of losing my  think, it is because Œ 
Q: We don™t. 
A: I Œ I want Œ I want to tell you th at, I Œ I don™t have an  opportunity to talk about it, 
I don™t. 
Q: I will definitely ex
tract every opportunity. 
A: It™s Œ it-it Œ yeah, th-the i Œ the idea is th
at I Œ I Œ I don™t even Œ I don™t even try. I 
belong to  a Œ to a book club wh ich exists
 50 years already, and wh atev er in 
Israel
, 
and Œ and Œ and I Œ I thought that they ar
e Ho locaust deniers. They were Holocaust 
deniers. I-I changed that one perception ther
e, because they read some books and so  
on. But Œ but gosh, you know,
 it™s Œ they say there was nothing special about the 
Holocaust and this. Those were leaders of the communists at one time, and they 

were Œ they were kind of thinking in a gl
obal terms to include everybody, and the Œ 

RG-50.030*0580

so Œ so Œ actually, and I don™t have frie
nds who were Œ with who I can kind of 
rehash it. I-I know that in 
Israel 
people meet, and Œ if they were in the camp . I Œ I 
think that I would like to Œ to
 Œ to save an insider™s vi
ew, because I am actually Œ I 
have to be grateful to 
Krikosava
(ph), who died in the ghetto
 on tuberculosis, despite 
everything. I have to be grateful to 
Bo lek
(ph)
 Yakobovitch, 
who was the fiancé for 
Dora,
 h-he Œ he saved my life by pulling me
 out from there, you know, and putting 
my  ca-candidacy as Œ as the one. It™s a Œ it Œ it Œ it is Œ I Œ I would like Œ I would like 
as Œ personally that Œ that
 Rumkowski
 should be seen Œ should
 be seen no-not only 
in terms of Œ of being Œ wh at Œ wh at is th-t
he word , like that he Œ he Œ he tried, he 
tried. H-He Œ he tried. He was misguided lo
ts of times. H e tried his best, also most 
of the times. The Œ 
Gertler
 was bringing death to many Je
ws, he wound up as a hero 
after the people were writing letters that he
 saved their life and things like that. The 
Œ the people who died, almo st at his 
hands, wh ich may count to hundreds and 
thousands, they cannot write le
tters that he saved them Œ th
eir life. I think that there 
was Œ there is an injustice 
in this one. There was a Œ
 Dora Œ D-Dora  Fuchs
, they 
were locating me after the war, I Œ I wanted 
to go to the camp 
with my friends. We 
were very Œ we were very, kind of connected. The 
[speaks fo reig n la ng ua g e here]
 
those 12 Œ 12 or fi Œ 15 
[indecipherable] 
12. Wa Œ wa Œ wa Œ over Œ over 10 
children who were there, 
some of them alive,

from 
Wilna 
who Œ who died and so on. I Œ I was 
with them, so I wasn™t any more 
participating on the daily things that 
Dora
 is doing or not doing. Neither did I know 
Œ 
Q: But they were Œ they  were Œ all those people whom you just mentioned, they  
were part of the orphanage? 
A: Yeah, but 
Do ra
 and 500 other people, less than 5
00, I think, left later on, this Œ 
this I alread y heard from Œ from 
Bernard
, okay? And the fact is that they were left, 
they were left under the tutelage of Œ of the 
Beebo w
(ph). And Œ and they were Œ and 
they were Œ they had good condition. 
Eric Ya ko bov itch 
had a son, 
Mula
. 
Mula
 
was five years old, and there were some Œ 
a few hours, they were not Œ they were 
not delivering fo od, or whatever, so 
Mu la
 says that he want chocolate, and 
Eric 
Ya kobo v itch 
was raging. This was in the camp, 
in a concentration camp, for the 
privilege, raging, my  son is hungry, wh ere 
is the chocolate? Where is the chocolate? 
My son is hungry. The Œ the ch
ances for survival 
in that group, I think that very few 
have died. The father of Œ of 
Ita
 
Salo mon
(ph), which is the wife of Œ of 
Bernard
, 
and she is still alive, b u
t with the Œ with the 
Alzh eimer™s, 
which I seem to be 
getting, maybe. 

Q: Not Œ not a chance.  
A: Yeah. So, an-and say the 
survival Œ the survival was 
almost, almost complete, of 
those people. Where I went, what I went 
through had Œ had very little chance for 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
50
survival. I came together very
 romantically wi-with the bo
ys and the girls, and Œ and 
we thought that we will live together, all 
of us, like a group of youngsters, but not 
men or women yet. That we will share ever
ything, that once we come to the labor 
thing and so on, we will support each othe
r, and we will be stro
ng and Œ and so on, 
so Œ w-we came to be 
[indecipherable]
. So, you know, in 
Birkenau
 right away, 
right away  part of us didn™t make it. I ma 
Œ I made it, I was smal
l Œ I am small. And 
I don™t know how I went through Œ through 
the initial selection. I think that I went 
through the initial selection because I coul
dn™t believe I saw Œ we
 already knew, as 
we were undressing, they already told us
. When we went one way, already people 
told us, you go to life. And Œ and I believer 
there were only maybe a hundred or 200 
from the whole train, and the rest Œ the re
st went right away to Œ the train which 
came a day before us, everybody went, the 
day after us, everybody else. Us, had a 
small Œ a small contingent of su rvivors. Bu
t then there was the 
selection, and this 
time the selection was undressed. So, I ha
ve a white jacket, because see, it was 
custom made still. I had from that time, 
so maybe I looked a little bit stronger. But 
then we were Œ we were undress, and ther
e was that figure in black going back  and 
forth, and it really fascinated  me, like that Œ that Œ that
 situation of a man deciding 
that or Œ or Œ and I was Œ and I was looking at
 Œ at that Œ at that assessment, a-and I 
was Œ I was staring. When I came there, there was kind of a movement of 
resignation that he Œ he put me there to Œ li-
like he kind of o-okay, put me to, and I 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
51
think was it, did my  staring 
do it? My physic simp ly wasn™t Œ I wasn™t like a person 
for work  yet, never Œ never did I see 
[indecipherable]
. I will never know, nobody 
would never know, but I had 
other occasions that I remained alive because of 
something unexplainable, some Œ somebo
dy did something, somebody had Œ had a 
mo ment of comp assion, or Œ or Œ or Œ 
or wh atever, again and ag ain and ag ain, 
because I came to 
Mauthausen
 later on. And Œ and 
Mauthausen
 was Œ and later 
that it was 
[indeciphera ble]
. And Œ and then  there was Œ 
then there was the hospital, 
I went on the hospital. And Œ and the war fi
nished for me, not on the fifth, the war 
finished for me, I Œ I k n ow wh
en. On Œ I Œ I must have, in
 my  d eliriu m, I mu st h av e 
in the hospital in Œ in
 Austria
, in the baseme nt of the hospital, I mu st have, being 
delirious, and I remember talking del Œ 
del Œ delirious. As a matter o f fact, I 
remember that I was doing some Œ that I was e-engage and ar-articulate whatever 

speeches. That™s what I reme mber from my Œ from my be-b eing in a high delirium. 

But I mu st have mentioned that Œ the 30
th
 of May. That™s what I was so Œ so the 30
th
 
of May must be my  date, and Œ because in
 delirium wa Œ it came through. And Œ and 
a nurse brought me Œ there were two nurse
s, one Ukrainian, 
one Œ one Œ one was 
Austrian. They brought me a Œ a Œ a card w
ith birthday. That™s the first time during 
the war that I cried. I never cried during
 the war, not once. And Œ and Œ and the war 
finished, and the things started from that point on. 

Q: So, going back to Œ 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
52
A: Yes. 
Q: Œ to we Œ we were still Œ 
we Œ you gave us very nice,
 very educating run-through 
what happened. But I just wa
nt to go into little details. 
A: Sure. S-Sorry, I think that I was Œ 
Q: No, no, no, it was ve
ry good, but th-th Œ 
A: I-It Œ 
Q: Œ I just wanted to Œ 

A: Yeah. 
Q: Œ if you reme mb er any de
tails from the time, cause we 
Œ we are getting into 1944 
and your deportation. 
A: Yes. 
Q: Right? Do you rememb er any circumst
ances which were around it, cause you 
were in this privileged part of 
the ghetto, and how did that work?  
A: Oh, it Œ in the ghetto? 

Q: In the ghetto, when Œ wh
en you were deported to 
Auschwitz
. 
A: I Œ I was Œ I was not any mo re Œ I pla
ce myself outside the magic circle, okay? I 
was Œ I wanted to go with my  
Œ with my  friends and Œ and I 
didn™t want to say that I 
don™t want to be with 
Dora
, I Œ this would be crass, 
or whatever. And even more 
under Œ I just said that I want to be with this Œ 
Gertler
, just knowing that I have 
friends, 
Gertler
 gave me Œ gave me a bike. Oh, 
incidentally, someone called me a 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
53
couple of months ago, and his name is 
Walter Kelly
(ph). He was one of the three 
men who was sent from the 
United States
 by this organi Œ by 
your organization to Œ 
to review, receive the Œ the Œ the rec
-records, 18 kilometers of records. 
Q: Ideas? 
A: Whi-Wh ich were Œ n-n-no Œ re-recor Œ rec Œ 
Q: Record s were in 
[indecipherable]
 
A: Œ German er Œ the records in 
Germany
 Œ 
Q: Yes, yes, yes. 
A: Œ wh ich Œ wh ich was open, 
Walter
 was one of them. So, here a Œ here is some Œ 
somebody from there. And I say, 
Walter
, do you rememb er something about a bike? 
And he says, sure, you were coming on a 
bike, and every time you were giving me a 
chance to Œ to drive aro
und. So Œ so here is 
Walter
 the first person who says never 
mind wh at the historians write, there was at
 least one bike in the Œ in the ghetto. 
Q: Mm-hm. So you Œ you got 
Œ you got that bike, and we
re you riding your bike in 
the ghetto? 

A: Sure, sure. Yeah, that™s the idea. To 
Ma rysin
, because this was the other end, 
going 
Lagiewnicka
 63 was 
Ra digosz
(ph). Goes to 
Ra digosz
 and I would Œ 
Q: So you were constantly, de-desp
ite the fact that
 you lived in the 
Rumkowski™s
 
apartment, you were constantly
 in touch with your collea
gues, with your friends, in 
Œ in 
Ma ry sin ,  
in the orphanage. 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
54
A: Ti-Til I created the situation that ki
nd of things were dissipating and I was 
spending more and more time with my fri
ends, and it was kind of accepted. And Œ 
and 
Rumkowski
 from time to time, he would call 
me to see how I am making out, 
how I am doing. So Œ 
Q: D-Do you remember ever, the 
Rumkowski™s 
visits to the Œ to 
Mary sin
, to the Œ 
to the orphanage there? 
A: To Œ to th e orphana Œ every day s Œ ever
y second day to that orphanage, to the 
small t Œ orphanage. An  interesting thing,
 that somebody lookin
g for an orphan age 
like that, there was a twin 
orphanage with some 12 Œ 
12 youngsters, which were 
chosen by Œ by 
Rumko wski
, and she was looking for people from her group. Her 
name is 
Lucia Ailmer
(ph), I think. And Œ and instea
d of finding her people, she 
found the people in Œ in my  gr
oup. So, we are Œ we are in contact act-actually now. 
So somewhere there was that secret, second 
Œ like, there were two. I thought til now 
that there was only Œ 
only Œ only one.  

Q: And there 
Rumkowski
 was taking care of Œ of 
the Œ o-of Œ of Œ of those 
youngsters who were in thos
e orphanag es, right? He was Œ 
A: Oh, th e orphanag es? Yes. And he was 
pushing for schools, and he was pushing 
for Œ for young people who have
 a chance to surviv
e, to Œ to have a Œ a better chance 
to surviv e through fo od or g
ood work, or something. He wa
s not God, he didn™t have 
a right to decide who is, who isn™t. But he 
probably  thought that he is doing exactly 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
55
the right thing. Oh yes, when  Œ when he
 was twirling me around ab out wh at Œ wh at 
he thought history will say about him, he w
ill Œ he will say Œ he Œ he s Œ he will say 
that after th e war, you Œ no, I and you will go in 
America
, and I will give a 
referaten
 Œ just the f-first time th
at I head the Œ the word 
referaten
, which means 
lectures or something. So Œ so his Œ th
ere Œ there was no question in my  mind after 
that little thing, that he was not
 afraid of Œ of Œ of history,
 but that he Œ he has done Œ 
that he has done his best. 

Q: And your Œ your feeling is
 among th e Œ the people that 
Rumkowski
, w-was he 
aware of the fate that is awaiting everyb
ody, including himself, or Œ or he was in 

denial of that, or what Œ wh at would you th
ink? Ho w Œ how did he 
treat the Œ the tr Œ 
the truth, that he mu
st haveknown, right? 
A: If Œ he Œ he Œ he mu Œ he mu st have 
known, even because Œ 
even Œ he™s twirling 

me around, and being happy. Was Œ I lear
ned the same evening, was because the 
Germans have left the ghetto intact. This 
means that if he say intact, not killing 
everybody, this means 
that he must have known the alter n ative to leaving intact.  
Q: Mm-hm. And how Œ how 
were the others, th-the 
Fuchses,
 the Œ the 
Gertler
, they 
were als Œ also aware? 

A: The 
Ge-Gertler
 was not only aware, he was a perpetrator. This is 
[indecipherable]
 was a smart man, nice man, gentle ma n, but he was the second kid 
to Œ to get Œ at one time in the ghetto, 
Krieger Œ 
after they took away 
Gertler
, 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
56
Krieger
 and 
Dora Fuchs
 and 
Eric Yakobovitch
 were deciding ev erything about 
the ghetto. No matter who was being blamed, 
they were deciding. I saw it, I saw the 
process, I saw the meeting, I saw them Œ 
I saw them say so that I am a fly on the 
wall. I didn™t think that my memories will 
be historical in some
 way, but Œ but you 
know, I also, you know, so
metimes Œ sometimes they would Œ th ey would hush a 
little, and the child is there or something,
 you know. And Œ and we go back and Œ 
and there was no way, the apartment wasn™t very great. There was Œ 
Dora  Œ Dora 
Fuchs
 had her Œ her room with Œ with blocks
 of ice like bricks from ice, so you 
couldn™t see the counters. There was 
my room with Œ with a bed where 
Bernard 
Fuchs
 was using, and that™s what became 
available for me. I-Incidentally, an-
another thing which bothered 
me; there was Œ the-there we
re two Œ two machines in 
the ghetto. They were called the 
diathermia
. This is a word from that time.
 Dora
 
had some occasionally stomach cramps. A
nd this was Œ this was prescribed for 
people with 
diathermia
. It was Œ it was said to me, I didn™t count, that there were 
two 
diathermias
 in the ghetto. 
Do ra
, for herself and the re
st of the 160,000 or 
100,000 people who had only the use of one 
diatherm ia 
machine, because 
diatherm ia 
machine was in her room, just in case 
she feels like it o n  this is the date 
that she wants to apply the 
diathermia, 
and so Œ 
Q: What Œ what was that machine? Wh
at Œ what was Œ can you describe Œ 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
57
A: Th-They™re doing somethi
ng good for her Œ fo-for her 
intestines or whatever, I 
didn™t go deeply into it. There was a cow in the ghetto
, you were probably not Œ you 
didn™t hear about that, about 
the cow, possibly Œ I don™t k
now if there are two people 
in the wo rld who know about the cow. Th
ere was a cow in the ghetto. There was Œ 
there was an orchard in the ghetto. And 
everything very hush-hush, , but it was 
there. But it was every morning, almost
 every morning, the chief of police, 
Rozenblat
 or something, would brin
g eggs. At one time he forgot to bring eg gs, and 
Bolek
(ph) 
Ya kobo v i tch
 was slee ping over, he was slee
ping over, af-after all, she Œ 
she was his fiancé, 
Bolek
(ph) Œ 
Bo lek
(ph)
 Ya ko bov i tch
 was eating breakfast, my  
father died of hunger, this
 was early in the game. And I was eating breakfast, I Œ I 
finished my breakfast, 
Dora ™s
 father, Papa was invited for breakfast. So he was 
eating breakfast and Œ and he
 was Œ he packed  lunch, a beautiful sandwich or 
something with an egg and sp
 Œ it was with, not egg, sp
routs and things like that. 
And he unpacked it after I finished brea
kfast and says, would you like to eat my 
lunch? I didn™t give it a second thought, I 
ate his lunch. But he was sending me Œ I 
also got the message, you know? We Œ we 
Œ we Œ we measure Œ we Œ we measure, 
somehow, you know, what 
we Œ or whatever. At Œ
 Bolek
(ph) 
Ya ko bov i tch
 said, 
because the eggs were not de
livered for Œ for breakfast, he says, you see? You can Œ 
you can live a day with out eggs for breakfast, he says to
 Dora
, or something like 
that. You see, you can eat Œ the chil Œ children were born and died  in the ghetto 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
58
without ever seeing an egg, with out knowi
ng what it is, or what it tastes. And he 
says that it™ s possible to survive. 
Ya kobo v itch 
wife, 
Regina
, dropped in just to have 
a talk with me. Dropped in and she had a sa
ndwich  and she started over with  her s Œ 
she started to Œ to eat the sandwich an
d Œ an d wrapped it up and put it back. She 
says, the doctors say Œ said the best Œ the 
best way Œ said, th-the Œ the best way to 
eat, is to stop eating while you are still hungry.
 This was in the ghetto where Œ which 
hunger was Œ was giving ev erybody an  unen
durable pain, just the Œ the feeling of 
hunger. The doctor told her that it™s the he
althiest to stop while she is still hungry, 
and ex ercise and a diet, or something like 
that. And I Œ I Œ I couldn™t Œ I couldn™t 
stop, my father just died of
 hunger. My mo ther was Œ mu st have been  very  afraid of 
being Œ being taken aw ay, as
 a person who cannot wo rk 
any more, or whatever. And 
then, okay, but then I Œ I pr
efer to be Œ to eat Œ wh ich means, like I have my  
principles that I have to compromise with
, but Œ an-and ne-nev
ertheless, it was Œ it 
was good to Œ to eat that. At the same ti
me when I went over to th e other children, 
there was less food and less 
[indecipherable]
 but, at that time it wasn™t a question of 
hunger or no hunger, and it didn™t make a difference.  
Q: So, it Œ and that was the ba
sically everyday
 life after the 
gaspara
(ph) Œ 
A: Yes. 
Q: Œ and d-during 1943, up until the Œ 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
59
A: Concerts, reviews, theaters, th-t
here was e-entertainment, dinners. 
Dora Fuchs
 
was a big Œ was a big th Œ kind of dinner 
arran Œ arranger. She was very inventive. 
She wasn ™t doing it by herself, but 
she was very, very inventive. 
Q: So who would be coming to  th
ose dinners? The Œ the Germans? 
A: No, th  Œ but, they  would Œ th e people
 were coming who were always head s of 
departments in the ghetto. It Œ it was a Œ 
Dora
 was able to pull out Œ in Œ in a setting 
of home, she was able to pull out anythi
ng, anything she wanted
, without the people 
Œ without th-the people wanting or not wan
ting to  say. Sh e Œ she was a genius. She Œ 
she could draw out, people couldn™t stop th
emselves, only blurted out, an-and she 
was Œ she was the puppet master  
[indecipherable]
. She Œ she was a much more, 
let™s say a Œ say, her job descripti
on. As a matter of fact, I-I saw it, 
Eric 
Ya kobo v itch 
was sitting on a chair. I 
remember lying on the 
corner, and Œ and she 
was standing over him, and she was shak
ing a finger at him, and Œ and she would 
say, remember with some things, one Germ
an closed all the Œ all the food in the 
ghetto, th is, and no one is Œ was allowed to
 touch the food. This means punishing 
the whole ghetto because he got angry a
bout something. And it was a question of 
hunger and people dying and wh atever, a
nd things getting rotten at the same time. 
Well, 
Dora Œ Dora
 spend the night, and Œ in 
Lódz
. She came back and Œ and she 
was proud th at she got the Œ she go
t that this was an example of 
Dora
 being able to 
do so me things, wh ich amb Œ anyh
ow, she was shaking her finger at
 Eric 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
60
Ya kobo v i tch
, who promised her that he will neve
r do anything with out first running 
it by her.  
Q: Do you have any recollecti
ons from that time of any of
 the Germans? You said th 
Œ at one point, that 
Genovine
(ph) Œ not
 Genovine
(ph), th-the 
Beebow
(ph) came. 
A: Yes. 

Q: What are your recollections of 
Beebow
(ph)? How did he behave there, how was 
Œ 

A: 
Be-Beebow
(ph)? 
Beebow
(ph), I think that 
Dora
 Œ
 Dora
 admired
 Beebow
(ph), 
because number one, she was ch
anging his shirt every day. 
Q: Oh, okay. 

A: Numb er two, she saw what™s written a
bout him, that he is an extraordin ary 
organizer. This was his freedom from 
the eastern front, needless to say. 
Q: Right. 

A: So, he had like a Œ a very high
 thing. I think Œ I think that 
Beebow
(ph), a Œ a 
drunken, who probab ly attack anyone if he 
drinks, and he was very  careful wh at he 
does publicly. That means that he wasn™t Œ 
wouldn™t engage in an
y Œ in any beatings 

or this or being angry. He wouldn't 
Œ he Œ he was spending mo re time with 
Ya kobo v itch, Eric Ya ko bov itch.
 A friend who was in 
Lódz
 after the war was 
telling me that he attended the 
Œ Beebow
™
s
(ph) trial, and 
Beebow
(ph) all the time 
said that they should ask 
Erici Yakobovitch, Eric Yakobovitch, 
like what 
Eric 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
61
Ya kobo v itch 
will say, would Œ would 
Œ would have much importance after the war. 
Which we said
 Beebow
(ph) was naïve in some Œ in some respect. I know that 
Beebow
(ph) had lots of money, siphoned o
ff from the ghetto, because I heard and I 
heard again, and it was obvious, and it wa
s always kind of that
 we understood. I 
think that 
Gertler
, who all at once after the war was Œ he was the head of the 
underworld before the war. So
 Œ at Œ it Œ I think th at 
Gertler
 all at once, gets to be a 
big manufacturer in 
Mu n i ch , 
and I think th at he knew wh ere 
Beebow™s
(ph) Œ where
 
Beebow™s
(ph) stash of monies and 
[indecipherable]
 away, this is my wa Œ thi-this 
is nothing, this is just a feeling I Œ I 
have. Bu t there were pilgrima ges going to 
Gertler,
 the murderer. This was un Œ unjust 
Œ he didn't deserve an-any of it. 
Rumkowski
 didn™t deserve all the contempt that he Œ that he encounters by 
subsequent historians.  
Q: Mm-hm. So, do you remember any ot
her Germans coming th ere for Œ o-only 
Beebow
(ph)? 
A: No, I remember Œ oh, I re Œ I re Œ I reme
mber that tough talkin
g, that they were 
talking with Germans, but th-the names di
dn™t Œ didn™t dis Œ there was Œ somebody 

was protecting Œ was protecting
 Ru mkowski. Beebow
(ph) Œ 
Beeb ow
(ph) had to be 
careful with 
Rumko wski. 
Any other Jew he could kill,
 he probably 
couldn™t kill
 
Rumkowski
, he would Œ he would Œ he would have to an swer to Œ to  some. I

Q: And you don™t know 
who th at person was? 
A: Who that pers Œ after the war, it
 came to me Œ aft-after the war 
Dora Œ Dora
 was 
working in 
UNRRA
 in Œ in Œ in 
Brooklyn
. The 
Ya ko bov i tches
 were there, 
Erik
 
and this Œ 
Mula
, meantime, got to be super-duper si Œ rich in Œ in 
Kissimmee, 
near 
Kissimmee
 in 
Florida
 with horses and vintage cars 
and all kind of 
things. And he 
did it at Œ at the record Œ the record sp
eed, and guess where the money came from? 
A 
Krieger
 son, 
Ma la ch i
(ph) was in the Œ he was in 
South Africa
, I think. 
Eventually Œ even
tually in Œ in 
Mia m i
 as well. We are talking about riches. Those 
are Œ those are old things of monies which 
accumulated in the hands of a few. There 
is no doubt in my mind that this Œ this 
was on Œ on different scales. Those monies 
didn™t just happen. 
Q: So when the time of Œ th-the final de
portations in 1944 came, when  did you learn 
about that? Do you re Œ do
 you recall anything? Wh at was the sequence of Œ you 
know, of Œ of th Œ of the ev
ents in Œ at the Œ at the 
end of the liquidation of the 
ghetto? 

A: I would say the liquidation of the ghetto 
at that time was not that the Œ that the 
second sh oe has fallen, only th at the second 
shoe is falling. So, it was something that 

everyone wanted to avoid. People compla
ined about the ghetto, but were doing their 
utmo st to avoid deportation from the ghetto
. The Œ the worst date
s that they ghetto 
had, probably wh en 
Rumko wski
 was missing for two days. There was despair 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
63
throughout the ghetto, everyone™s nerv
es were this, because with all the 
complaining, they felt that at
 least there is some kind of 
a hand at work on behalf of 
survival. Must have felt it, because otherwise, why curse 
Rumkowski
 and be so 
terribly concerned wh en  he is missing fo
r two days? So , e-e-everybody knew, and Œ 
and the rush was to resource which are lik
ely to be need ed by Œ by the Germans. 
Resource means the factories.  
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: So, let™s say 
Himowicz
(ph) fac-factory, which is metal 
[indecipherable]
. Th-
then 
Za tlersort
(ph), where I was working, this 
had a chance because it was for 
military rucksacks, it had a ch
ance to continue as a group work ing together. And this 
is the transport that we have chosen to 
go with. We probably 
got advice also, which 
to get of Œ of course, all this
 was nothing, the only group was 
Beebow™s
(ph) group 
that he brought to 
Flossenbürg 
and Œ and wh atever, divided. So  this Œ this was the 
only Œ th e rest, the rest, the mo me nt Œ the moment people came into the camp, th-

they were Œ they were just meat fo r gri
nding. So this was the atmo sphere of the 
ghetto, that people hoped to be lucky and 
be at a place where their work will be 
needed.  

Q: So y-you were deported 
how Œ when the deportations 
started, how many days, if 
you remember at all, y ou were still 
there before y-your own deportation? 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
64
A: How Œ how Œ how lo ng? I Œ I know that 
Rumko wski
, 
Rumkowski
 came a week 
after we arrived, our group. Wh en did I 
learn about that, I don™t read many books 
about that or anything, but some Œ some
times, here or there I notice a Œ a note, 
which rings a bell. So he Œ he came a 
week later. The story was that Œ that 
Beebow
(ph) didn™t want to release his brot
her to go with that select group. So
 
Rumkowski
 decided to Œ to Œ to be Œ it™s the 
Œ the Œ the other part of the story. 
Q: To go with his brother? 

A: Mm, yeah, it™s Œ he didn™t Œ and Œ and Œ and 
Rumkowski
 put many Œ just means 
Beebow
(ph) put, after giving 
Rumkowski 
and his fami ly, his very small family Œ 
incidentally, 
Stanislaw
 looked like the brother of Œ of th e Œ of
 Rumko wski™s
 wife, 
Mrs. 
Rumkowski. 
They say that she married  
Rumkowski
 in order to save her 
brother, tuberculosis. And she co
uldn™t save her brother, but 
Stasiuk
, 
Stasiuk
 was Œ 
looked and was like her brothe
r. It looked to me that 
Rumkowski
 kind of talks to 
me more th an he talks to 
Stasiuk,
 maybe because 
Sta siuk 
was Œ 
Stasiuk
 was so 
very serious and measured, I don™t know. 
Nice, nice guy. You could build  a house 
on whatev er he said. 

Q: And 
Stasiuk
 went togeth er with 
Rumko wski
, as far as you know? 
A: With 
Rumko wski
, yes. 
Q: And so he didn™t survive? 

A: He Œ he Œ he did no
t survive the first day. 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
65
Q: So, when  Œ when  you were going to  Œ to 
Birkena u  Œ 
A: Yes. 
Q: Œ to this, did you have any clue wh
ere you were going? Did you know anything 
about it, did you Œ 
A: Abso  Œ 
Q: Œ did you know what to expect? 

A: Abso lutely nothing. Abso Œ the Œ the ghe
tto lived for Œ for four or five years on a 

what we called 
kaczki
(ph).
 Ka czki
(ph) means just something wh ich flies by Œ 
Q: The rumors. 

A: Yeah, and builds up a rumo
r into, like, something that 
they know. From my Œ my 
personal story, the ghetto may be of intere
st, my real war, and you can say luck in 
survival, started actually at Œ at that
 time. Coming Œ coming into Œ into the 
concen tration camp, and Œ 
and winding up in Œ in 
Ma uthausen
,
 Braunskirsche
(ph) 
and so on. If Œ if Œ if I would, and the war 
would be finished, at Œ at Œ at the times 
that we talked about, I think that I would 
have suffered a quarter or less of a Œ of a 
risk of death and an ugly 
story of cannibalism, ways to escape Œ to escape sexual 
advances, and remaining alive. Luck co nnecte
d with it. And I don™t know if we have 
a Œ and I could Œ I could proba
bly condense it in Œ in a 
number of sentences, but I 
don™t know if we still have Œ have place for 
that story. But this was Œ this was the 
real war, and this was Œ I Œ my life was save
d, because of different good people. At 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
66
least on three occasions, my life was saved by German
 SS.
 On one of the occasions, 
by a Œ by a Œ a enthusia
stic killer, a young 
SS
 man, who turned out to be a killer 
once we were on a forced march. I shared 
his bread with me. Hard to understand. 
Q: So when Œ wh en you 
Œ when  you got to Œ to 
Auschwitz
 Œ 
A: Yes. 
Q: Œ in Œ in Œ in ™44, this
 is the Œ you Œ you never Œ you
 never heard of Œ of that 
name before, or you never Œ 

A: 
Auschwitz
 
Birken au
? 
Q: Yeah. 

A: N Œ ab -absolutely not. 

Q: No. 
A: I Œ I Œ I 
Œ 
i-if there would be two people 
who knew about that, it would be
 Œ
 it 
would be 
Gertler
, 
Krieger 
and Œ I think, and Œ and 
Do ra  
knew Œ 
Do ra
 knew Œ 
probably  she knew ev erything, who knows? Bu t no. 
Q: Cause you mentioned also that someone ha
d a radio, and Œ but not even from that 
source Œ 
A: Do Œ Dr. 
Szwa lo wi cz
(ph) had Œ had a radio.
 Of course, he will be killed if Œ if it 
would co me out. 
Q: Right. 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
67
A: 
Bernard Fuchs
 was saying that 
Szwa lo wic z
(ph) was giving him the news. There 
were only a few people who were doing it. 
Szwa lo wicz
(p h) was the Œ the dentist of 
Rumkowski 
and 
[indecipherable]
 and 
Beebow
(ph). 
Szwa lo wicz
(ph) was the 
dentist of 
Beebow
(ph). He had to  get a special pe
rmission from the Gestapo to go to  
a dentist, to a Jewish
 dentist in the ghetto. 
Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. So, you arrived in Œ in 
Auschwitz
 and you said that you didn™t 
go through initial selection. 
A: I didn™t. 
Q: Your sel Œ selection happened  wh
en  you were already naked, and Œ 
A: Oh, no, I Œ I Œ there was Œ th
ere was a selection right away. 
Q: Mm-hm, on the ramp? 

A: On the ramp. There was another selecti
on in the shower, and 
the hiring Œ hiring. 
And Œ and Œ and Œ and then Œ do 
you have some time? B ecause Œ 
Q: I™m sorry? 
A: I was just wondering if you have some
 time, because I am Œ I am cruising around 
what happened at that point, and Œ and Œ an d it™s not clear. 

Q: We do ha Œ we do have all the t ime that
 is required for that. It
 Œ it™s Œ th-this is 
quite important, if you recall Œ if y ou coul
d recall what happene
d when you arrived 
to 
Auschwitz
 in a-as detailed as possible, you know. 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
68
A: Well, I Œ I arrived at 
Auschwitz
 at Œ a few of us, the ones who were not taken to 
this, we came to block 14, and block 14 
they  would ch ase us from place to place 
with sticks, and just to ha
ve an occasion. A Œ a man ca
me up on th e chimney, saying 
that there is only one way out, through Œ th
rough th e chimney, you know, so th at we 
would be Œ the Œ the old 
stories, horror story. 
Walter
, of 
Russia
, I have the name 
here, I go Œ I have a calendar here Œ 
Wa lter 
himself was Œ was hit here with a stick, 
and he started to cry, not because of the s
tick, only because he didn™t give us food 
the whole day. And even at that point I 
found it like a Œ you kn
ow Œ you know, like 
a little bit, you know, funny. He
 doesn ™t remember it. So th
e Œ at that certain point, 
the Œ and a large man comes in the middle 
of tha-that speech, and so on, give up 
money and so on. A l Œ a 
[indecipherable]
 came over, and he was a butch er, I 
learned from 
Pionki
(ph), a nice person, from what I have seen. And Œ and he says, 
can somebody peel po
tatoes? And everyone started to peel potatoes. I knew I have 
no ch ance, I Œ I was squashed by the people.
 I remained where I was, near the wall, 
and he pointed at me. And Œ 
and people started to pass me
 o-overhead to Œ to him, 
like Œ and Œ and they say, oh you will surv
ive, you will survive, like this would be, 
you know, like peeling potatoes would mean 
survival. And I peeled potatoes, they 
cooked. What ha
ppened that Œ that night, the 
blockalteste
, the 
blockalteste
, which 
means the leader of the block, at the entran ce to the main block, th-there was a little 

Œ a little place which Œ which wa
s the kitchen and also the 
blockalteste
. In this 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
69
particular place it was not only the 
blockalteste, 
but also the 
lagerfuehrer
 Œ the 
lagerfuehrer
, this means the main Œ the main 
blocka lteste, 
whose name was 
Willie
. 
Willie,
 nobody had an
ything ag ainst 
Willie
. He Œ he was going to 
Familienlager
 
very often. He was released early for Œ an
-and sometimes people on a transport saw
 
Willie
, and Œ and it was like a friendly thing. He
 was a captain of a ship wh ich sold 
the load because of 
some romantic entanglement, they
 said. And Œ and Œ and he was 
well known by Œ by the people. And the 
Familienlager
 who came from 
Theresienstadt
, who were in the 
Potenkins
(ph) village, feel it wasn™t necessary any 
more to Œ to present that theater to  the 
cro Œ Red Cross, Sw edish Red Cross. And th-
that 
Willie 
on one side. And now I Œ I was worki
ng in  the kitchen, doing wh atever 
they were telling me. It was getting late, but
 nobody told me what
 Œ what to do with 
my self. At one point, a Œ a German Œ th-there was an 
SS 
invited that Œ into to those 
festivities. Somebody there was a 
ka po
 who played on Œ on an
 accordion, or the Œ 
and that officer comes, an officer, it looke
d to me like an important officer. But he 
came over to the kitchen, and he is drunk, an d he is asking for water, and I gave him 
water, and I answer him in Œ in Œ in Ge
rman. So he says, oh, I know German, how 
come that I know German? I must be a 
Mischling
 or something, and I said n-no, but 
at home, this means at home, this means 
Dora Fuchs
 and so on, we spoke only 
German. My first book, 
[indecipherable]
 in
 British Columbia
, I Œ I read there, you 
know, the first German book. And Œ and I 
did the mo st stupid th ing that anybody 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
70
can do in one™s life, because I was emb
ittered  by Œ I saw the 
smoke coming out from 
Œ from the chimneys, and because he aske
d me, do you also sp
eak English? And I 
say, what for, so I burn better? A-And I sh
owing this a Œ I thought, i-in a moment I 
will Œ my head will be under his boot
, or he will shoot me, or he will 
[indecipherable]
 I Œ I 
[indecipherable]
 already on Œ already this
 second day, I have 
seen people killed all over the place. So he
 says Œ he kind of sobered up, and he 
says, oh no, not boys like you. We will Œ we
 will teach you a trade, and after the war 

you will be working for the 
Reich. 
And Œ and that™s how it fi
nished. The next Œ the 
next day, didn™t finish Œ it didn™t finish, 
I didn™t tell to anyone that. And this is Œ 
then I don™t know what to do. 
Willie, 
who Œ who occupied  a c
ubicle, says Œ says 
[indecipherable] 
there is a bed. A bed? People were
 lying on the floor all over. But 
I went bed, and he sidles up in the bed, an
d I am petrified, completely. I don™t move, 

I am frozen. He talks to me and so on, and Œ 
and I am Œ I am petrified. So he started 
to talk to his little dog, and he 
says that he is not a good 
burscha k
(ph), he is not this, 
and so on. He Œ he kind of turn ed around and I s Œ I Œ I 
left the bed, and I didn™t 
have where to sleep. I didn™t 
know if to go into the bl
ock if somebody will beat me 
up. So I remained in this s
ection in the kitchen, a-and I 
slept there. In the morning I 
was woken by th e din of givi
ng Œ giving th e Œ giving bread Œ bread and something 
[indecipherable]
 or wh atever, to the passing people
. So I helped. It was Œ this time 
it was some cheese, and the one from 
Pionki
(ph), the Œ the butcher from
 Pionki
(ph), 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
71
who was also the cook, was very nice to me
 and so on, so he also gave me some 
potato from the day before, which made a 
big difference. And later on, the boxes, 
the crates remained with Œ with the Œ for 
Œ with some cheese gl-glued to it. Can I 
take it and Œ and Œ to  find my  friends and 
give it to them? Well, my friends was Œ 
Walter
 I didn™t know so  Œ so
 well yet, but other, 
Benek
(ph) and 
Chaim
 and Œ and 
so on. 
Benek
(ph) in
 Mary land
, here, nearby, he lives nearby. It started to Œ I went 
out with the box, and people abso lutely a
ttacked me, to Œ broke the box into little 
pieces. I never found him, and there was lik
e between the blocks
, you Œ you had like 
a promenade. There was a time that you we
re in between things
, and you could walk 
back and forth. And I don™t know if it wa
s the same day, or the second day or the 
third day or the fourth  day. After a very 
short time, all at onc
e, everybody on one 
section of the Œ of the Œ of the promenade 
is being like taken Œ 
taking in  a gauntlet, 
and put into  a block, and so me Œ some 
people, like stronger pe
ople would be put 
aside, but small people, and old people,who Œ who somehow Œ so me of them were 
[indecipherable]
 for some time Œ  I was new Œ were 
pu sh ed  in to  Œ  in
to that block, 
op-opposite the 14 block. No w, thi-this Œ 
this was Œ it Œ it was so tight that it was 
like Œ it was difficult to breathe, because
 everything was sque
ezed. No sitting, no 
this, you know, just trying to sit in each 
other™s lap, fighting fo r breath. I remember 
my  chest hurting th e way it hurt now, with a 
Œ with heart disease, like empty, empty 
hurting. And Œ and it was in the mi ddle of th e 
night, middle of the night or wh atever, 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
72
there are cries, the lights go on, flashlight
s coming to Œ to  my  row, showing no this, 
this, people started to try and make space. 
I was taken out from th
at bunch of people, 
brought to th e door. At the 
door was the German officer,
 Willie,
 the guy who 
wanted me to Œ to Œ to do 
sexual things to him, and 
Karl
, which was the Œ the main 
ka po
, or Œ aft-after 
Willie
, a man Œ a man Œ a lame Œ a lame person with a stick. 
And they pulled me out and they put me in
to block numb er two. In block numb er 
two there was a bunk to sleep, and Œ and th is was the first block near the 
SS stuba 

entrance. And the 
Ca na da
 commando were there. 
Canada
 commando were actually 
the people who were Œ not where they do th
e Œ I Œ I read something, clothing and so 
on. Some of the things with the 
Ca na da
 commando, yes, those were clothing, things 
to sort out. But the people  who were working at the 
receival Œ 
at th-the Œ re-
receiving the people on the trai
n and emptying this and so on
, this was the Œ the real 
Canada 
commando. Most of them at that time were from
 Holland
, where Œ where I 
was. They  had fo od and all kind of th
ings. I was brought there, and they pass 
without any resolution where I belong and 
what™s my  name, or whatever. And Œ and 
then I am told that I will be
 Œ I will be the runner for th e
 SS
 
stuba
, which was the 
next, and the 
SS stuba,
 th Œ it means, like if there was a 
raport
(ph)
,
 an 
appell
, and 
everyone had to be in front 
of th e block, and later they would make a tally of Œ of 
the people, and Œ and I would 
Œ I would have to run along 
it, and bring th e pieces of 
paper. The 
raport
(ph)
 pier
(ph) is standing in the middle,
 would correlate if th Œ all 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
73
the people are there. If not, 
the thing has repeated itself.
 Sometimes it repeated just 
in order to show peopl
e, you know, to be punitive, or Œ or whatever. And that what I 
was doing, and jobs were bei
ng piled up on me. One of the 
SS 
men had the rabbits, 
and he wanted me to bring 
greens. The greens were Œ were growing near the electric 
wire, where nobody would go. Bu t I got a nu
mber, for the first time, I got a number, 
which yesterday here I was in the file with
 my number, which is 
already not visible, 
almo st not visible. It Œ it was a small Œ 
a small portion of that. You Œ you probably 
haven™t seen a numb er that Œ and 
Œ I™m sorry, yo-you said something? 
Q: W-We have to change fo
r a second, just a moment. 
[break] 
Q: Yes, are we? Yeah, okay, it™s done. 
A: This was Œ this was my life fro m that
 point on. I was vac
illating between being 
on th e edge of Œ of death, to Œ to all at
 once being Œ being either better off than 
everybody else, or being worse than
 everybody else. And I was positioned 
[indecipherable]
. So, that™s what I 
was doing. I met there
 D i n a  G o ttlieb o va , 
she 
fought about Œ about her paintings. So
 she was coming Œ she was coming with
 
Mengele
 in order to kind of pain t characteristics
 of Œ of Œ of the twin s in Œ in the 
ghetto. When Œ wh en  
Mengele
 came to mak e a Œ a 
raport Œ 
a Œ that means ju st a 
selection, she would remain where I was, at 
th e entrance to the bl
ock two, near th e Œ 
near the
 stuba
, and Œ and we talked. And we were
 in contact later Œ later on. I Œ 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
74
what coincidence, many, many years later. I 
think she is not well now, she wa Œ she 
is in 
California
, and Œ 
Q: She passed away. 
A: She passed away, yeah. 
Q: So when the Œ the block 14, 
both 14 and the block number two Œ 
A: Yes. 

Q: Œ were in 
Birkenau
, and those were the brick barracks, right? 
A: No. 
Q: No. They were on the other side. 
A: No Œ they  Œ they  Œ the 
Œ the brick barracks were in 
Auschwitz
 proper, and those 
were Œ and those were the Œ th-the barracks built for horses. 
Q: For horses. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: So how far Œ you mentioned be
fore th-the fa
mily camp, the 
Terezin
 family 
camp? 
A: Yes. 
Q: Were you in touch with that, or di Œ 
were you observing it, 
were you Œ wh at Œ  
A: I Œ I Œ this Œ 
Q: Do you have any reco
llections of that, other than the Œ what that 
Willie 
would be 
going to ? 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
75
A: Ah Œ at that time, yeah. I Œ I Œ I heard talking, 
Ka rl
 and so on talking that the Œ 
also something else happened that Œ that 
I know. Once somebody came to me, that™s 
means Œ those people were in Œ in  
Theresienstadt
. Somebody came to me and says, 
I heard that you were in 
Birkenau
 at that Œ that time, an d 
she said that they saw my 
brother, from Œ from 
Theresienstadt, 
from
 Familienlager
, there. Is it possible that 
Œ that he Œ th at he was there? And Œ an
d I told her, yes, it™s possible. Somebody 
passed on the same circumstances saying y
ou shouldn™t give people false hope. I Œ I 
felt insulted. I didn™t, but it was possible, 
why was it possible? On the last night, 
when  Œ when they were ta
king out all the people from 
Theresienstadt, 
it was 
Willie
, and his friend 
Karl
, and probably contacts that he
 had, which allowed him to 
bring approximately a hundred Œ hundre
d people Œ hundred young men from Œ from 
the 
Theresienstadt
 out into our end. And so th ey avoided being th-th-they  Œ th-they 
remained alive. So 
yeah, her brother could have been
 Œ her brother surviv ed this 
particular person. Bu t so Œ an-and then th
ere was a dispute with those people. What 
hundred people, wh at are you sa Œ talkin
g about? On ly  22, we were the only ones 
who remained, 22. My friend, 
he™s a psychiatrist, and he 
was in this. And I said, no, 
there were a hundred, I was there. 
Gilbert
 wer Œ wote Œ wrote a book, the Œ the boys 
of 
Birkenau
, or something like that. A-And he writes about those Œ those children, 
and Œ and he Œ and he
 writes about those hundred and 
Œ there is a page for Œ for 
every one of those hundre
d, and they are still in
 England
, the ones who are alive, 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
76
most of them are alive,
 and they are still in
 England
. So this was Œ this was what I 
knew, that little, in the Œ in 
the camp, and Œ and the later,
 because I just met people 
from there and we were comparing notes on 
some occasion. Just how I learned, I 
thought that 
Dina Go ttliebova
 is a Œ a Œ a Œ I said that the-there was a Œ once, I said 
[indecipherable]
 I said Œ somebody sa Œ oh,
 I see you have a number from
 
Birkenau
. I said yes. So I say, I see you ha
ve a number, too. So , yes, yes, I was 
there, in the
 Familienlager
. And I said, there is someone
 on my mind that said, I 
will probably never find out 
what happened to her. She wa
s sent, so I thought she is 
going with Œ she is going with 
Mengele
, she probably knows 
much more than the 
rest of us do. And probably  Œ an d Œ and sh
e was sad. This also Œ this also doesn™t 
allow me much hope. Sh e Œ she 
[indecipherable]
 to Œ had a husband, 
Rudy ,
 and Œ 
and she says he is talking ab out
 Dina Gottliebova
. 
Bobbit.
 I was in contact with her 
later on, and 
Bobbit Œ Bobbit
 is a Œ is Œ is her husband™s Œ her husband™s name. And 
she was fighting to get the Œ to get so
me Œ she was also somebody who not Œ 
admired her boss. And this is Œ she admired things about
 Mengele
. Things were 
coming all the time. W h en 
she talked ab
ou Œ about 
Mengele
, some kind of pride 
came into her voice, you know? Like she wo uld make an example. She says, I made 
his portrait, she says. She was doing many portraits for his friends as gifts. And Œ 
and then  six or seven of th
ose Gypsy paintings, and th e 
wall, which is probably in 
Israel
, in 
Yad Vashem
, the Œ the wall Œ the wall the se
ven dwarfs, that™s what the 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
77
children wanted Œ wanted once
 they were there, in the
 Familienlager
. They were in 
a room, and she pain ted it. And Œ and, so the seven dwarfs. And actually, she 
married the man who was the author of
 one of the seven dwarfs, which is 
Bobbitt. 
So, we are now with the Œ so I thought that
 there is no survival. 
There is absolutely, 
there is absolutely
 no su rviv al. And Œ 
Q: Were you Œ were you the w
itness of the liquidation of the 
Terezi n 
family camp? 
A: I-I Œ I was there when Œ when
 they took them, but this is the Œ this is the night 
that they brought the almo
st hundred boys into  Œ 
into the camp
, into the 
Zigeunerlager
, the Gypsy camp. But my friends were
 there, and as a matter of fact, 
they are in 
Montreal
 and now he re-retired as a Œ an
 Œ and he is writing his third 
book in Czech, about those tim
es, about a re Œ reminiscence
s. He is Œ their children 
are Œ were from childhood, wi
th what happened, involved
 writing poetry on those sa 
Œ things. My  children, I protected them as mu
ch as I could, especially since I lost her 
Œ their mother at the age of nine and 12. Th
is is my  daughter, she was nine when  my  
Œ wh en my  wife has died. So, th e number Œ 
I said this is a telephone number, and so  
on. Til today they don™t know. Part of the 
fact that the family is meeting together 
here and I am giving the testimony and w
ill try also to leave the testimony fo r my 
family out there. This is the 
same, this Œ thi-this is part 
w hy we are here. But just an 
aside, that it™s good for the children to kno
w rather to not know, 
because they Œ they 
know anyhow, but in so me dark and un
touchable way. What
 Œ what happened Œ 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
78
what happened later on, I was lucky again. 
There was a Œ they we
re supposed to Œ to 
e-empty the 
Zigeunerlager
, and I don™t know Œ I don™t 
know the Œ how Œ how those 
minds work ed, but 
Willie
 was int erested 
in my survival. 
Karl 
was nice to me. I-It™s 
Œ n-nobody bother me. I Œ I could help othe
rs. I knew two boys, and their father was 
put in Œ into  a Œ into  that Œ the same bloc
k wh ere I was, and they  wanted to get the 
father out, and they  gave me a Œ a diamon
d, I didn™t want the diamond. And I went 
to Œ to one of the Du tch people that I kne
w, and I ask him for a couple of sardine 
boxes, so they can brib e the Œ the
 blockalteste
. They went, they br
ibed, they got the 
father out. Later they were Œ they were
 all going from some Œ on some assignment 
to work, hopefully. I gave 
him back the diamond and he accepted it. And Œ so th e 
idea is, if I could, 
somebody was in the 
kra nkenbau,
 in the hospital, I will bring in 
a metal container, food. But at one time th
e guard shot down the line. I Œ I was 
startled, and I got electrified, and Œ and fe
ll out while Œ while this happened. I also 
was 
[indecipherable]
 flowing back, and disconnected
, but it Œ it was a fe Œ quite a 
feeling to Œ to be the Œ I wa
s going to Œ to look for Mrs. 
Feldman
, who was the head 
of the orphanage before, that Œ the same
 orphanage. An d she was not Œ she is an 
artist, a known person in  
my life, felt fine. Mrs.
 Feldstein
. And I Œ I found other 
people. They  asked me for warm underw ear, 
and Œ and I would be
 bringing to th e 
people warm underw ear. One of them had the relative in 
Montreal
, who said that 
her underwear that I brought saved her life. Whatever. It Œ it™s Œ it™s probably 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
79
misconception with some people that it wa
s dog eat dog and only dog eat dog. It 
wasn™t. People were doing things whenthey  could. I did too. It was almo st 
something pushing me do something good, si
nce, you know, like Œ so Œ so th is was 
the time, and Œ but I 
don™t understand why
 Willie
 was so nice to me, after Œ after 
trying to  Œ to  Œ to get me to be his playth
ing or wh atever. He Œ 
he wasn™t rough, or 
he wasn™t this. Talked to hi
s dog th at I am not a good bo
y. And Œ and later he is Œ 
and I am Œ as the camp was going to be 
emptied, I am getting a letter from an 
SS, 
probably the same officer, w
ho I never, ever saw again. An
d that letter Œ with that 
letter, I was sent to 
Sosn owice. 
And in
 Sosnowice Œ
 in
 Sosnowice
, I arrived and I 
gave the letter to the commandant of the cam
p. And he says, if 
you were look Œ you 
were good enough to  be a runner in  Œ in
 Birkenau
, you are good enough to be a 
runner for me. One of the 
strangest things happened; if somebody would make a 
film, I would be the first one to say this 
is impossible: I was Œ I was running, stoking 
the fires in all the 
SS
 have their barracks, I was stoki
ng the Œ stoking the fire and Œ 
and all that; ea-eating sometimes from the Œ from the 
SS 
kitchen. Everybody knew 
me, it was a small camp. I sa
id that I was interested to
 see the machinery, always 
interested me, machinery 
[indecipherable]
. So I went for one shift, commandant 
praising me that I am interested. So I Œ I went
 to Œ to the factory.
 I liked what I saw. 
Poles were working together with the Jews 
from the camp, the relations were this. I 
didn™t see a Pole for years, five years, well,
 at that time. And it was very nice, I ti Œ I 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
80
fell a little bit in love with
 one Polish woman who was in 
the center of the factory, 
writing things down, reading poetry, so we
 have something Œ something in common. 
She was talking something, so the youngsters
 that I said are running away they  say, 
to Œ to the 
[indeciphera ble]
 to 
Wa rsa w
, actually go into the 
forest, talking that 
maybe I can go into the forest, but I will ha
ve to avoid the Œ th
e Polish partisans and 
go 30 kilometers. It™s Œ I made a little readi
ng lamp in the works
hop of the camp, for 
the commandant, an 
SS
 man, a young
 SS
 man sees me and he
 says, oh, did you do 
it? And I said yes. So Œ so I say, take it. 
So he says, no, I will Œ di Œ you made it for 
the Œ for the commandant, no I will not take it. So I say okay, so I will make you 
another one. I Œ I make him Œ I ma de him 
another one later on. This is the young 
one, who was later killing people
 on that Œ on that road 
and sharing the bread with 
me, and other things, wh ich Œ wh ich help
 me to survive. There was another 
SS 
man  
there from 
Austria
, who was crying his head off be
cause he didn™t hear from his 
wife, and he thought maybe they were bom
bed, a-and Œ and I 
Œ I put my  arm on 
him, saying that the Œ maybe the post does
n™t work or things. 
He shared with me 
some sugar cubes, also on the trip, on that
 long trip where so many people were Œ 

were Œ were killed, 
per
 we Œ 
Q: The trip west from 
Sosnowice
? 
A: From 
Sosno wice
 to
 Mauthausen
, yeah. Part of it was by train. 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
81
Q: Do you Œ do you recall any Œ anything 
in th e Œ in th e Œ wh ere did you walk  on 
that Œ 
A: No, to
 Gliwice,
 because Œ 
Q: To 
Gliwice
 now. 
A: Œ because the comm andant, a porky man, 
good-natured, but I never forgot that he 

reached his 
[indecipherable]
 in 
Da cha u . 
Ok ay , he got to be a comm andant in 
Dach au
, so he is not a gent-g entle Œ as a ma tt er of fact, so gentle, his family, like, 
they adopted me. I was running around
 the camp , I had the movement. The 
telephone was ringing in the Œ 
in the office, I would pick 
it up and say, this is Camp 
Sosnowice
, so and so, and take a message. And 
Œ and now it looked to me Œ show it 
to me in a film and I don™t believe it, you 
know? That Œ so this
 was the true. But Œ 
but that™s how it was, that was the thi
ng. I Œ I was a Œ a Œ decorating the Œ the 
Christmas tree. I took every candy out, as 
a joke, and Œ and have
 only empty candies 
there, I didn™t need the candies. But it wa
s a joke, and it was accepted as a joke, but 
where did I come to do this 
[indecipherable] 
but I did survive. The Œ the gift that I 
brought to th e commandant that I made, wa
s packed as a gift
 from Œ from me. The 
family had gifts Œ gifts for me for Passove
r. It™s a Œ it was a crazy time out, a-at 
crazy times, crazy places. 
Sosnowice
 was different, separate from Œ from anything 
else you Œ you Œ you can 
say. Nobody was Œ  
Q: What Œ what kind of a factory was that Œ 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
82
A: They were Œ they were in Œ in 
Sosnowice, 
they had to march a certain dis-
distance, and oh Œ oh Œ oh yes,
 I Œ when they started to 
tear
 with running away to Œ 
to the partisans, I Œ I asked the Œ the comma
ndant to be Œ to  Œ to Œ to free me from 
my duties, because I want to learn a trade,
 to be useful. And 
he stopped the whole 
column and praised me, because Œ and I actually
 wanted to see Œ to give a chance to 
run away , and Œ and to see he
r mo re often. She was mu ch older, with knowing eyes, 
she knew exactly wh at it™s doing to  me. I was 
the hungry. I was rest
ed. It™s Œ so, that 
was Œ that was Œ so one mo rning Œ one mo rn
ing, everything is packed. I didn™t have 
to wo rry any mo re what choice I am making, it was a difficult choice to be 

courageous, to run away. I didn™t know if 
I had the courag e. And we started to Œ to 
[indecipherable]
 at 
Gliwice, 
the commandant unloaded hi
s stuff, his furniture, and 
Œ and it occurred to me that I will ask him th
at Œ maybe to hide in the furniture and I 
will help the family later on. But I chickene
d out on that as well. After Œ after that, 
that young 
SS 
man was crazy, the Œ going around 
and shooting people; he had so 
much energy. He brought me Œ at the e
nd of the day he brought me his coat, 
spattered with blood, to wa
sh out the blood. And I was 
washing out the blood, and 
felt sick over it, brought it to a 
place where Œ where they Œ where the 
SS
 were 
sleeping on the floor with 
Œ with Œ and there was a 
panzerfaust
 or something, you 
know, a grenade, and I though
t Œ I thought if I will grab
 the grenade and throw it, 
maybe we™ll change our Œ b
ecause we could hear the Russians in the back. And Œ 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
83
anyhow, I didn't  know how to actuate it. 
It™s Œ I s Œ I saw a movie only recently 
where Œ about a school for 
SS
, and said that you unscrew 
the bottom. So for half a 
century I didn™t know how I 
could have done it, but I saw the movie, right, yeah, 
now, now. So, and Œ and 
th at way we came to 
Ma uthausen
.
 Mauthausen
 was Œ 
was Œ I had, from sleeping on the 
ground, I had four large furuncles.
 
I couldn™t bring 
it down. I went thro ugh th e selection, beca
use it was in Œ in two days it swelled up 
more and more. We had the Œ the Œ that 
thing written, that™s me Œ somebody was 
going around writing down  the names of the 
ones who have to go
 to the hospital. 
The hospital actually was the Russian lager, 
and actually it was a place where they 
kill people. Put people in, 
and bottles of chlorinated wa
ter, phenol injections, al-all 
kind of things. So, on th e way Œ and th is mi
ght be of interest, on Œ on th e way there, 
there is the 
lageralteste 
from Œ from 
Sosnowice, 
and the
 lagera lteste
 was Œ was a Œ 
a delegate to the Œ to the 
Reichsdeutsche™s
 
Reichstag
,
 
wha-whatever the na Œ the 
name was. And Œ and he was held
 in very high esteem b y  the 
raportfuehrer
. I heard 
what™s going on, the bombing, because the tw
o of them talked, and Œ and later I saw 
this 
lageralteste
, but he was hiding his Œ his red 
Œ red triangle, because the Œ the 
ka po s
 in 
Ma uthausen
 were criminals, and no
t political. And Œ and this 
ka po  
criminal w as actually in charge of the Jehov
ah Witnesses. They have some tailoring 
blocks, or whatever. So  he talk
ed Œ he talked 
to Œ to that 
ka po
 as we pass. My group 
was halted, and Œ and they™d  say talk to th
e Yugoslav, and I was br
ought to that Œ to 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
84
that hospital, which I didn™t know, only that 
it™s not a good place. I didn™t know th at 
I will go to death. And some
 SS
 put me on a table from Œ from stone, and he started 
to cut and I started to faint. He spraye
d something and I fainted again. And I was 
brought to th e block. I was brought to Œ 
I don™t know when  and how I was brought 
to the block. 
Q: But it was in 
Mauthausen
? 
A: It was in 
Mauthausen
, and Œ 
Q: Not gunski Œ
 Gunskirchen
? 
A: No, it Œ it was 
Mauthausen
, it was Œ it was the Œ the 
quarantine, two Œ two Œ 
Q: Uh-huh, the quarantine. 

A: Œ two Œ two blocks were quarantined. 
Q: Right, yeah. 
A: So Œ so I was Œ I was lying there, I didn™
t have to stand up for a Œ to be co unted. 

Before that, she helped me to stan d and I 
was collapsing the mome
nt. But that Œ they 

let me  recover, I wrote poetry ag ain. There were some Poles there again. And again I 
was helped, and Œ and I wasn™t Œ I Œ I didn™t
 take myself the lu
xury that actually 
what I write is empty phrases, you know. 
It™s a Œ it™s Œ was good to have their 
support. And Œ and th en Œ then , one Œ one Œ one evening, I™m sleeping in side there, 

an-and somebody gets to me and si
gnals to me to go. This is the 
blockalteste
 o f this 
block, the quarantine, an Austrian. And I 
heard that two days before, he killed a 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
85
Hungarian boy in th e washing Œ washing 
Œ where y Œ where you wash hands of Œ 
you kno Œ you know th
at? And he Œ and he tells me 
to go to his cubicle, also a 
cubicle with Œ with clothes. And I made Œ 
I made noise to wake up people and he 
retreated. And th e next mo rning everyone goes to the 
appell
 to Œ to that 
count, to the 
Œ we knew that we are going to the count 
to the big square, not the Œ for counting 
everyone. And as I am passi
ng by, he is waiting with a 
milkmaid™s stool, and he 
throws it straight on my head. A-And I ma
naged to sn eak out from under it, and run 
out, but Œ but this was Œ this was my last 
Œ last day of life. I was standing th ere for 
hours, and Œ and I knew it™s the last day 
of Œ of my  Œ my life, and I was making 
peace with it; everybody died, everybody died
, and Œ and now I™m 
going to die, and 
Œ and that™s it. We were standing, and la
ter separated Jews from non-Jews. We were 
some 300 Jews. They  brought us down  to 
lager number Œ number three, which is a 
[indecipherable]
 lager. We were there maybe a c
ouple of days, I don™t know, it was 
very, very cold, freezing at that time. And 
later they brought us
 over to a Œ to a 
[indecipherable]
 lager. This means there were so many people coming from the 
front, Hungarians mostly, and many 
Mischlings, 
with families, w-women and 

children, that they brought those o Œ those 
[indeciphera ble]
 in those tents Œ tents, 
circus tents, and tha Œ they 
were overflowing. There were 
[indecipherable]
 and Œ 
Q: But it was still in Œ in 
Mauthausen
? 
A: It was still in
 Mauthausen
, but just the temporary 
[indeciphera ble]
 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
86
Q: Right, right. 
A: Œ all around. And then a small plane 
comes. And Œ and th e plane Œ those people 
were work ing at the front, and Œ and th is
 hit them, the hunger and everything, and 
with the families they were, th
e families were lying in front 
of their families Œ of the 
other member. And a small plane comes and it shoots up the towers in 
Mauthausen.
 
Some wer Œ somebody must have 
written about that, I don™t know. 
Q: It was a Soviet plane, or Œ 
A: A Soviet plane, they think. They think 
that one Soviet was there, and he says, I 
will be here later. This mean
s like he™s going to run away. 
It was a Soviet Œ a Soviet 
plane, shot on th e towers. And later, 
through two rooms 
on the Œ on the 
SS
 barracks. 
What he didn™t know, he coul
dn™t have known , that near the barracks now are those 
tents, and the bombs fell into the tents. 
So, there was that all over, and pieces of 
flesh. There was no place for everybody inthe tent. Flesh on the wires around that. 

The next day there was Œ there were cooking
 fires, that the people still had utensils 
from their trip. 
Kaduk
(ph), a 
raportfuehrer 
from 
Auschwitz
 was going around. 
Wherever he saw something 
in a pot wh ich was suspicious, he would kick it over 
and shoot a few people. Other fires were
 going, people were not exactly running 

away. It was extraordinary, it was not
 like from living people running away, 
scurrying away, and him going and sh-sh
ooting people. Later on, there was no Œ 
there were no bombs, and you could see mi
ssing buttocks on peopl
e still alive, still 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
87
the Œ the mouth is still movi
ng. I didn™t tell it to anyone.
 And when I wrote I only 
wrote that those were Œ well, from Œ from Œ from 
Mauthausen
, from this place, we 
were sent Œ and we Œ we 
were Œ we Œ we had lice ri
ght away. The ones from the 
camp didn™t have lice, but the ones from the 
trip never had a chance to Œ to wash 
them Œ wash themselves. And 
we were taken over to Œ to 
Gunskirchen
. 
Gun-
Gunskirchen
 not Œ not far from 
Linz
 and so on. Th-The weather was better, we Œ 
we Œ we ate grass. We ate some 
escargots from the grass. Came to
 Gunskirchen, 
Gunskirchen
 was Œ was the place to die. I wa
s dying. There was no place to lie 
down  inside, outside it was rain. So people 
went on and use Œ use the belt to remain 
on th e rafters. I did, too, but you couldn™t 
go out, if you go out, 
they would not allow 
you to co me back. Some people didn™t care. I crawled down , I couldn™t come back. 
Remained there near the Œ near the dig-
out, which was from before, with feces and 
so on, and Œ and in the rain. And Œ and 
the Americans came. He
sitated a little bit, 
what they will do, whateve
r. And that™s how I wound up 
in the hospital. And th-
that™s Œ that™s Œ I Œ I Œ I have never Œ neve
r had a chance to Œ to
 say all the things 
that I am saying now. It is Œ like, peopl
e don™t know Œ don™t know, and it Œ and Œ 
and it™s Œ and it™s probably hard  on everybody. I am glad I had a chance to Œ to say 
what I did. I Œ I have mo re, but th
is would take up too mu ch time. 
Q: No, no, no, no, it™s Œ do you
 want to take a break now? 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
88
A: Well, it™s not a question of 
Œ of a break. I could be mo
re concise, but it was in Œ 
in a way I don™t know how noticeable it wa
s, but it was like a Œ a stream of Œ of 
consciousness. I never thou
ght about Œ about the Œ the 
willu Œ 
the 
Willie
, the one 
who probably saved my  life, o-or wanted me
 to Œ to be a s-sex Œ must have been 
drunk, because he had a woma
n, and Œ and this. Maybe he
 felt bad because he even 
Œ he even  created that little situation to
 an innocen t, obviously. You really don™t 
know where Œ where you get the Œ wh
o you™d get your bikes from, like 
Gertler
 
gave me a bike. 
Q: That Œ I Œ I Œ I think that we should st
op fo r the moment, and we will most likely 
have some questions or so, but that can 
come later. But I Œ I think that you said 
enough during this time on this Œ 

A: Is it possible to find out who wa
s Œ who was the delegate to the 
Reich? 
Who was 
the 
blockalteste
 on
 Sosnowice
 at that period of 1945? 
Q: To do the

Q: He was 
lagerfuehrer

 Sosnowice. 
A: Later in 
Mauthausen. 
Q: Later in 
Mauthausen. 

A: Yeah, because I saw him in 
Mauthausen.

was a Œ he was a prisoner, right? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: So he Œ he mu st have been th e memb er of

-w hat Œ what party was he?

cal, he had the red Œ the red thing. 
Q: Right. So he probably was from Œ 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Œ social demo crats or Œ or something like that. 
A: I Œ I Œ I have Œ I have no 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: And you Œ you have no idea
, no hint on what Œ what 
even his first name was? 
A: Yeah. I knew, but Œ 

Q: You don™t remember. 
A: Yeah, well Œ well, I don™t remember.

Q: Fair enough. But maybe we™ll be able to
. We have to talk to Œ to Œ to someone 
who was doing research in that 
camp. And that would be the Œ 
A: Oh, in what camp? In Œ 
Q: The 
Sosn owice. 
A: 
Sosn owice
, yeah. 
Q: Right. 

A: The good camp. 

Q: The good camp. And that was Œ 
you think that when you get to 
Sosnowice, 
that 
was already in 1945, or Œ or Œ or yo
u were in still Œ was it winter, or Œ 
A: 1945.  

Q: 1945. 
A: It was winter, we slept in
 the snow most of the time. 
Q: So that™s the Œ and then 
it is really difficult to Œ for 
you to remember anything for 
Œ wh at was happening after th
e quarantine in Œ in Œ in 
Ma uthausen
, cause it seemed 
to me that you were half time unconscious. 

A: Ah, that Œ that mean s like a-after the war? 
Q: Af-After the Œ you were liberated, that™s Œ 

A: Yeah Œ yes. 
Q: And so Œ so wh en th e Œ you spent, just 
to finish up that portion, you spent time in 
the Œ in the American hospital in 
Gunskirchen, 
right? 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
91
A: It Œ it was an Austrian hospital, as fa
r as I know. The upper Œ th e uppist Œ the 
third floor was for wounded German soldiers or 
SS. 
The second Œ the Œ the Œ th e 
second Œ the lower floor from that 
was for the Œ for the citizens of 
Linz. 
The ones 
from the concentration camp 
and the hospital, around by 
an American captain or 
something, but with the old crew of doct
ors and nurses, or whatever, the wa Œ the 
ones in the Œ in the lowest 
thing, this was the basement
, this was us. The Ukrainian 
nurse and the Œ was going around to gi
ve injections, she had a bask et with 
injections. There was no time to go around 
the bed, there was no place to go around 
the bed. She was Œ she was giving injections
 the same thing. I had a black spot on Œ 

on my Œ this, for years in
 Israel
, I had the black spot from 
the injections deadening 
the Œ that Œ the flesh at that area, for year
s, til Œ til one day I Œ I look and I see she is 
all gone, you know. So Œ so that was Œ that Œ that was Œ I don™t know who it Œ if 

people were informed to Œ 
to th e highest degree. Maybe the captain wanted to  be 
nice, a nice occupier and we were an un
known species, whateve
r, we had the worst 
treatment. The least treatment, I™d Œ I won™
t say the worst treatment, only the least 
treatment. 

Q: And from that Œ from the camp , you Œ 
from Œ from the hospita
l, when  you were 
released from the hospital, where did you go? 
A: There was either 
Lin-Linz 
or where else I don™t know
, although I remember the 
name of the place, 
Alpenjäger
 
Caserne. 
And I don™t rememb er how long I was 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
92
there to Œ to continue a story just a little 
bit beyond, is when I could, I got a paper 
from the Œ from the city hall, 
by an American, and who wa Œ who was there in city 
hall, to Œ to afford me a assistance as I look for my mother, because there was still 
time for illusion about her right away 
then. So, I-I Œ I-I was Œ I was going around 
with that paper, and th en I see a group of people 
[indecipherable]
 you have to sleep 
over, eat something. They were going to 
Switze rland
, and they told me to Œ to Œ to 
lower my age, because they
 were supposed to take 
youngsters to Œ to Œ to 
Switzerland
, about the school Œ school level, a 
certain school level. They  didn™t 
know much either about what was happening.
 School level. So she told me, just put 
Œ put less 
[indeciphera ble]
. And I was later on those Œ 
I was stumbling over those 
dates. Once you have a piece of paper, ever
ything starts to emanate from the piece 
of paper, and Œ and then you 
leave it alone, and then you 
find su Œ as I, that I w as 
going around with a Œ a incorrect date
, which, it shouldn™t matter much. 
Q: So, did you go to  
Swit zerla n d
? 
A: So I Œ I registered to go to 
Switze rland
, but a little bit further, there was another 
legation, English. Okay , and 
Œ and they were Œ and Œ an
d some of the English are 
the ones that jer Œ
 Gilbert
 is writing about from the boys of 
Birkenau. 
Now, th-the 
next legation was American. As Œ so I ha
d to sleep over, and so on. They  were 
encourage Œ they didn™t have 
enough Œ enough youngsters. 
They all came out with a 
goodwill gesture, but they didn
™t have enough, at this area
, there, th ey didn™t have 

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
93
enough young people survivor 
that they can Œ that™s why 
th ey say Œ say Œ say that 
you are less in age. And then I saw 
a soldier, a soldier surrounded by people, 
speaking Yiddish. A pole 
that here was written 
Palestine.
 And then I rem Œ then I 
reme mb er how I talked to him at length,
 or where Œ when th
ere was a chance I 
waited out a Œ the crowd and so 
on. He told me the best way 
to find relatives is to go 
to 
Israel, 
once they have a speci
alized Œ a specialized
 facility, they call it 
mabrodliki
(ph) 
puskravym
(ph), the Institute for Fi
nding Relatives. And Œ and 
then, you know, you don™t have a telephone , you don™t have this, you don™t have 
communication. You Œ it Œ it really, it has to
 be a chance once to  a thousands that 
you touch base with someone wh o knows so
mething. As Œ an-and then, I remember 
that during the war we also said that if we
 sep arate, then Œ then those people will be 
our contact. So I went to 
Israel
, and that™s where I was fo r 11 years. I was there a 
student, I was a volunteer in the 
pel-mah
(ph). I was later a Œ a teacher, for some 
three years. My wife was from 
Canada
, we Œ we were not sure where we will be, 
but decided to give one year to 
Canada
, which with th e birth of my son and so on, 
turned into a perm
anent thing. So Œ so that Œ that™s
 what happened after the Œ the Œ 
that means the fact that 
Œ that I found myself in 
Ca na da
. 
Q: And in 
Canada
 you always lived in 
Mo ntrea l ? 
A: Yes.  

RG-50.030*0580
 
 
 

 
94
Q: Okay. So I guess that we 
can cut. Thank you very much
. It was quite informative. 
We probably will have tons 
of Œ of questions still.
