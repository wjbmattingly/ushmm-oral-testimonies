 POTOMAC,MARYLAND
 
 
The date is July 27
, 1992 and we  are speaking 
wit h Mr . Harry Tabrys  in 
Potomac, Maryland.  Mr. 
Tabrys , coul d you plea se  tell  me  your na me , your
 na me  dur i ng the  war , you
r date  of birt h, your  
place  of birt h a nd then a nyt hing you possi bly ca
n about your chil
dhood and growi
ng up in your 
town;  and where  you we nt t o s chool  
and a bout your fa mily, a n d--, okay?
 
 
My na me  is Harry Tabrys.  I was 
born in Vilna, Poland 
in 1924.  The 
exact day wo uld be March 4. 
We  were a family of six 
children and my  parents, of
 course, were a family; I mean a larger  family of 
aunt s and uncles a nd gra ndpare nts . 
 I  mysel f was the se cond one a ft er 
my older br othe r .  I went to 
school in Vilna.  Actually
 I  went  t o t hr ee school s.  I  star ted out
 wit h a He bre w  sc hool, t h en I went  to  
a Je wi sh sc hool  and t he n sw
it che d t o a  public  sc hool.
 
 
Co uld you tell me the differ
enc e  bet we e n a He bre w  sc ho
ol a nd a  Je wis h sc hool?
 
 
Hebrew was a cheder-- was stri ctly 
a cheder.  Jewish school  was mo
stly Je wis h la ngua ge plus  the  
Poli sh language .  The public scho
ol wa s str i ctly, ever ythi ng wa s ta
ught i n Poli sh.  The r eas on wa s  
fi nanciall y because publi c
 school  was supported by
 the gover n ment  and didn
't cost you as muc h  
wh ereas the others you had 
to pay fo r it.  In other 
words ,  like you go t o pr iv
ate schools here in the 
Uni t ed States.  
 
 
Wa s the Je wis h sc hool  run by a pa
rticul ar or ganizati on or  wa s it pri v ate Tarbut ( 24) s chool s or  
somet hing li ke t hat  or--? 
 
 
I actually don't reme mber.  As  far 
as I know, you used 
to pay mo nthly.  You 
used to have pay 
mont hly be c ause  it was  privatel y.  By what kind 
of an or ga nizat i on it wa
s r u n, I don't  re me mber .
 
 
Als o, were  you calle d Ha rry i n Poland?
 
 
In Poland my 
name  was Aaron.
 
 

Aar on.  The n you wer e c alled Aaron by your  fa mi ly?
 
 
Aar on.  I n fact, t he t o wn where 
I come from, you know.  Th ey didn'
t call me Aaron.  My name as it 
is written in Polish is
 written Aron but they
 called me Arke (30).
 
 
Ar ke?
 
 
Yea h.
 
 
 
How would you s pell  
tha t in Engli sh?
 
 
In English, A-r-k-e.  Be
cause in the town, everybody by what ev
er na me  you had, had t he e nd of t he  
na me was al wa ys k-e , al wa ys k-e .
  My c hil dhood, of course , I mea n
 in a family where there's six 
kids  and t he sole pr ovi de r was my 
fat her, was not easy.  As t he ti me
 progre ssed and it  c a me cl oser  
and closer towards 1939, the anti-
 se miti s m was  gro wi ng an d  the Je wis h wo rker  was  losin g mo re  
and more as far  as his 
source of support.  Th e 
situation, the econo mic situ
ation got worse and worse 
and wor se.
 
 
Wh at was your fa ther's  occupation?
 
 
My fa ther 's  occ upati on wa s, actua
lly he was a  chi mney s wee p.  Besi de
s t hat he use d t o do all  ki nds  
of ma sonry.  He ma de a l i ving I 
mean as far as I can re
me mb e r .  Whe n  my  old e
r brot he r got  of a ge, 
for i nsta nce , I woul d say about t he age of 14, he wa s alr eady helpi ng 
out with my father.  I was still 

goi ng t o s chool .  Li fe, I me an, as fa
r  as s ocial  li fe was very, very 
interesting.  V
ilna wa s know as 
town most  progre ssi ve  i n  Je wish and He bre w  e du
cation.  It was renowned 
for the Yi vo (53), t hey 

call it.  Also that--one of the bi
gge st rabbis come s to 
Vilna, they call it Vi
l na Goan (55) .  We 
enjoye d ours elves  a mongst, the  Je
wish population I'm talking about,
 enjoyed ourselves spiritually  
and intellectually ve
ry, very mu ch.  
 
 
Wa s your fa mil y observa nt?
 
 
No, the fa ct of the matter is that 
my grandfather, t he one t hat I do 
re me mb e r , my mo th er 's fat her an d  
mother, they were ve
ry obser vant.  They forced
 us, i n  ot her  words  t he b
oys, my br othe r and mys el f, 

they forced us to go to 
temple with them until about 
the age about 12 or 13, if
 I reme mber correctly.  
But my father and mother , they were  not too observant.
 
 
Yo u didn't keep Shabbos?
 
 
Ye s.  There's no question abou
t it .  Wa s a  kosher home .  
 
 
Oh , i t  wa s?
 
 
But they we re not too observant.  By
 that I me an they di dn't go to temple as a lot of them di d in--
especiall y when it  ca
me Friday and Saturday
.  But  our parents, they forced
 us to go with
 them.  Till 
it came t o t h e age when we
 seen a lot of ot her s st
arted to belong to organi
zations which were more  
or l ess  fr eet hinkers .   We st oppe d to go, re bell ed 
and started to go
 a round i n  gr oups  and j oin for  
instance, some of them jo
ined Hahomer Hatzai
r;  some  of them joined Be tar, some  of them joined  
the Bund.
 
 
We re you i n vol ved in a n y one  of --?
 
 
Ye s, I  bel onged t o t he  organi zati on, the  under gro
und organization supposedly
 that  a lot of them 
thought because of 
the Polish anti- sem
iti s m and Russia  ri ght  there  ne
xt  t o , bor deri ng Pol and--they 
thought it was best to be
long to the commun
ist  or gani zation.  What  di d 
I know much i n--as far as 
life in Russia, at age 12 
or 13.  So you used to get togeth
er, illegally suppos
edly because the 
communist organization was in Pola
nd, they were undergr o und.  I n
 other words, 
they were not 
allowe d to be open.
 
 
What  was  this or ga nizati on calle d?  
 
 
I don't remember the name
 of it but there was alwa
ys around a little older, 
an instructor we used 
together for a couple of
 years befo re the war st
arted.  We didn't do an
y special activities, just 
indoctri nate d us .  The n agai n as  the  ti me we nt
 further and much clos
er , it wa s 1939, thi ngs  
happe ned i n  our house h old.  Rather  it was alr e
ady i n 1939 when t he war starte d and Ger many 
occ upie d hal f of Pola nd a nd Russ ia oc cupi ed the  pa
rt where I  was bor n.  The 
ti me  of t h e oc cupati on 
occ urred, I 've heard my older br other ,  beca use  of t h
e economic situation, my 
older  brot her st arted t o 
go and orga nize some  food. 
 Went  to the  Rus sian side  and one  
da y wa s ca ught crossi ng the bor der .  
He  wa s  arre sted  a nd  he  wa s se nt  
away.  Be cause of it, me , being 
t he  s ec ond one  in t he  househol d, 

the oldest  one, at t hat  ti me, my fa
ther had an accident, you know.   
He l ost  t he sight al most, i n bot h 
eyes .  Beca use he  wa s  unable  t o pr ovi de  for  t he  fa mi
ly, I was the one to take over it.  I was the sole 
provider.  You can im
a gi ne  the  ne xt t wo year s, me a  fourt een
 year  old boy pr ovi di ng for t he  fa mily  
with the rest  of the fami ly.  It  happened that  
my fat her , t ha n k God, he  
had an oper at ion.  Both 
retinas were detached--he 
had an operation and someho
w he regained most of 
his sight.  But still he 
wa sn't able to do much because he can't; in an ope
ration like that you're not
 supposed to lift , or 
strain yourse lf or  anything l ike  it
.  It  was very, very roug
h.  Then it  came t he 
time , all of a sudden in 
1941 whe n Ger ma n y s t a r ted a war  a g ainst  Rus sia
 and the whole thing tu
rned upside down.  
 
 
Ho w was it though during 
the occupation, the early occupation? 
 You were allowe
d to work?  It 
wa s, I me an, the  Russia n
s  di dn't pers ec ute you?
 
 
The fact  of the matter is that  whil
e the Russians we re there, they form
ed what t hey call--li ke unions .  
Each trade--they formed a uni on  of each trade 
a n d eac h trade --and I  me a n
 t her e was foremen and 
stuff li ke  t ha t.  Me , bei n g alrea d
y the age of 15, almo st
 16, I started to belo
ng t o  the 
sa me  tr ade  
orga niza tion, all t he se t ha t  are  chi mne y s w eeps for  in
st anc e, Poles or Je ws, a
ll belonged to this trad e 
orga niza tion.  The y  took a way pri v ate  ent erpri s e
.  For  i nst ance, 
people that had stores, they 
confi scat ed i t.  Any trade,
 you ha d to belong t o on
e group, like you call a un
ion here .  Bei ng t hat  I  
started to belong to these organi
zation, our situation a 
little bit improved 
because of the fact that 
they didn't discriminate.  Someho
w, we managed a little bi
t better because we di
dn't have this anti-
semitism that used to
 be before the Russian ca
me in.  Then, in between 
the government changed. 
Russians ga ve the town to the Lithuanians; Lithua
ni ans  wer e the r e nine mont hs.  Aft er that wer e  
kicked out and Russi
ans took it back until the mo ment when
 the war between 
Germany and Russia 
broke out .  Everyt hing we nt haywir e, e veryt hing.  
 
 
Ca n I  as k you, ca n I  ba
ck up for a mi nute?
 
 
Go a hea d.
 
 
Wh at language did you speak at home?
 
 
Mostl y Je wi sh, Yiddish.  
 
 
When the Russians came , di
d you know Russian or--?
 
 

I st arted to l earn by 
myself.  As a matter of fa ct
 is I have learne
d to a point.  Di
dn't go to school, 
didn't  have  t he ti me  be c ause  I  had t o support, ha
d to work.  But they br
ought  in Russian fil ms,  
Russian literature and everything. 
 By myself, I learned the languag
e, learned to speak because the  
Slavic language, Polish and Russia
n are little bit, yo
u might say, 
more or less, re
lated.  I even 
learned how to write by myself in 
those two years.  But 
I've since forgotten. 
 I still hear when 
some body s pea ks t o me  
Russi an, I  underst and what 
t hey're  saying.  Lit hua nia n la nguage, I neve r 
learned.  There wasn
't  mu ch  ti me  for it .   Th
ey were only there about 
nine  mont hs .  The  mai n  
langua ge t ha t  we s poke  i n our fa mily was Yi ddi s h
 which was the main langu
age of al l the Jewi sh  
populati on i n Wi lna .   Then, li ke  
I said, again wh en the 
war  br oke  out  at  that ti me , I ha ppe ne d t o be - -
there was an epidemic, typhoi d epidemic in town.  
I got  s i ck a  fe w wee ks  be fo
re.  I was laid up in 
hospital and when the war br
oke out, I was in the hosp
ital.  But still and all a
nd as much as I could, I 
got  toget her  the  fe w frie nds  be cause  we  kne w al r ead
y what  was going on i n Ger many a ll t hese  year s  
be for e the Ger ma ns oc cupi ed hal f of Pola nd, e sp
ecially after they occupi
ed, we knew what wa s  
goi ng on, we hear d a  lot.  I f yo
ur  fr iends  start ed to r un a wa y as
 mu ch as you could toward t h e 
Russian side.  Prob
lem was because
 of my previous illn
ess and without any pr
oper transportation,  
we  c oul dn't go too fa
r.  The Germans in the blitzkrieg, went  
s o fa r a hea d, wa y ah
ead of us.  We ha d 
no choice but to r etur n ho
me .  Wh en we  
came back at ho me al l  the de
crees started, ever y si ngl e day 
a new decree star
ted.  Little by little, 
first it started out 
by grabbing th
e young or th
e middle-aged 
ma n, they st arted to grab for wo
rk.  So me  of them never came  ba
ck.  Then, all of
 a sudden, they 
changed their policy and we
 thought that  they're going to gr ab
 the men and the 
young boys  s o we  
starte d t o hi de out .  One  of t he s
e days, they reversed 
the  poli cy.  I nste ad of ta king t he  young me n  
and the grown-ups, 
they took all the wome n, the 
elderly and the children.  The first time  they di d 
that, I  remember  there's mo
re intent housing or some
t hing li ke  that.  The y gat here d t he m toget he r  
and a bout  si x kil o meter s  out  of town wa s a  pla ce  ca
lled Ponari (189).  That 's
 where they ki lled them 
all.  We  di dn't know at  the ti
me but t h at 's  what  it  happened.
 
 
This wa s the Issacs gr oup then?
 
 
The r e was  the Issa cson gr oup (194) 
together with the Lith
uani a .  That ti me  already t hey force d, not  
they forc ed, they vol unt e ered.  The y, Lithua nian a  
lot of them, vol unteered in the SS and they did it 
toget her wit h them.  There was 
a pl ace that had some du
g, some big tr enches 
for oil  storage, the  
Russian did that.  That's where the 
fi rst killing started.  As a ma tte
r of fact, over the years, they 
killed half, at least half of the popul
ation, the Jewish population were 
killed down there.
  This how it 
happened that my mother and the youngest four  child
ren, they took them; it was six weeks after the 
occ upati on.  I re mai ne d wit h my 
fat h er.  My ol de r br othe r wa s in 
Rus sia a nd about  a wee k or t w o 
later, they formed the gh
etto.  At first they for med two ghetto
s.  We were lucky in a sense in the 
begi nni ng that one  of the  ghettos 
t hat  they for med, we 
li ve d ri ght on the  pr e mis es .  We  didn't  ha ve 
to move .  The re st of th
e fa mily, for instance, my
 fat her 's br other  and hi s fa mil y, my uncle; my  
father's sister, my aunt; the grandp
arents were alr
eady--they were killed also 
in the fi rst massacre. 
They were forced and could take
 whate ver  belongi ngs  t he y  coul d 
and they were  brought into the 
ghetto.  After a couple of weeks, 
they decide to liquidate one of th
e ghettos in which I was and they 

transported, some of them tran
s porte d, t he more able , the younger
 one s, trans port e d t o the  bi gge r  
ghett o whi ch was  onl y, you mi ght  s ay, j ust  a cross  th
e street.  The first one , 
the smaller ghetto, they 
liqui date d i t.  Whoever was a gai n acc ordi ng to the m
, too young, too ol
d, mothers with children, they  
sent  to Pona ri.  In the  beginnin
g, nobody kne w exactl y 
whe re they went  but  it di dn't  take l ong. 
Later on we  found that ou
t.  This is how life st
arte d i n t he  ghett o a nd t he  ghetto the re wa s onl y about  
six str eets.  The six st reets and t he si x str eets t hey
 squeezed together  i n the 
beginning, t hey squeezed  
together about 50 or 60
 thousand people.  Little
 by little, the ghetto took 
about two year
s.  Every  
now and then they came and they cleaned out  as 
the y  sa y, t hey pulle d out a  c ertai n a mount  of 
people .  The y re queste d, let 's  sa y t he  J e
wish police, they sh
oul d help the m out.
 
 
Wh at did you do, did you work 
while you wer e i n t he ghetto?
 
 
I di d t he sa me thi ng.
 
 
Oh you di d.
 
 
I did t he s a me t hing.  I wa s fort un
at e while I was in ghett o, I  was fo
rt una te enough t o  be a ble to go 
out on the outside by 
mysel f because accor di ng t o
 my oc cupa tion, I wa s-- .  
 The y divi ded the  t o wn 
into ni ne zones a nd I wa s give n one 
of the zones .  I wa s give n with 
t hree  Poli sh workers i n the sa me  
occ upati on.  I ha d to joi n the m 
e ver y morni ng and go to work wit h 
th e m.  Thi s  way , I  wa s for t u nat e 
that I could go by my self
 without  a  guard and come 
back by myself without a 
guard.  Of course, you 
weren't allowed to walk on the side
walk.  You ha d t o wear  the  yel l ow 
star  on both si de s but  most of  
the people  t hat we nt out  to work on the out side  of
 t he  ghetto, they ha d t o 
go with a guard to work 
and back home to the ghetto, My
 father remained working in 
the ghet to and I  
was  goi ng on the  
outside.  On the outside 
you had opportunities; you 
meet people,  I mean th
e Polish population, of 
course.  You had op
portunities to somehow orga
nize as far as food was 
concerned.  You bartere d  
clothi ng for  food whate v er you co
uld and you smuggled food
 into the ghetto.  Of
 course, it was life-
threat eni ng.  If you got c aught, yo
u c oul d be  shot.  In fac t , t he sa
me group t hat was  wor king on th e  
outsi de  t he  s a me  trade, we for me d  
a  group, we  organize d it  s o  we  
c oul d s muggle  in as  much food a s  
we  could.  We  c oul dn't say that  
we s t arve d for hunger  as  far  a s food
 is concerne d.  
But we lived in 
always  you lived in ghet
to without knowing what 
the ne xt da y is goi ng t o bri ng.  Be caus e e ver y 
couple  of da ys, e ver y couple  of w
eeks we had di f fer ent  r ules and di ff
erent--how should I say? they 
came out with--in Yiddish th
ey call  it  gzetzi n (284)--
 
 
Or dina nce s ?   
 
 

Or dina nce s.  Ever y da y and e ver ythi ng was  desi gne
d so t o ma ke  you fe el 
more secure.  It  was  
always the opposite what 
you thought is going 
to be.  Little by little as th
e time  went on, they were  
taking out more and more pe
ople and the ghetto is ge
tting less and less and less.
  Still in the ghetto , 
whi l e  we we re t here , sur prisi ngl y enough, t he  ghetto
 was  or ganize d with a l o
t of self-help.  We  had 
should I sa y, clinic s, for i nsta nce
.  There was a hospital t her e i n th
e ghetto.  Eve r yt hing wa s manne d 
by the  Je wi s h.  Ther e  was  kitc he ns , people  c oul dn'
t  affor d  meals.  There 
wa s eve n  the organiz ed 
concerts, within ourselves. 
 Of course, it was 
illegal.  Was a little library th
at you could go in and t o  
read so methi ng.  
 
 
Where  di d you live  
in the ghetto?
 
 
In t he ghett o , wherever  t here's left
, I  mean, fr om t he six st reets.  Fi
ve  s t or y houses  mostl y.  All  fi ve  
story house s  and the y  s que eze d us  in, you might 
say, in a  room, you c oul d have t hree  or  four  
fami lies.  It  was--the sanitary
 conditi ons  wa s hor rible  be ca us e yo
u didn't  ha ve  no runni ng water .  
Electri city, t hey had.  So
me of t he m ha d, for  i nsta nce , a  toile
t but it was a gene
ral toilet for the 
whole-- coul d have  be en in t his  h
ous e, it 's a big house , c oul d ha ve 
bee n fift y or si xty apart me nts . 
I magine each apar t ment  was about  
God knows how ma ny families.  
There was one  toi let  in t h e  
whole  hous e , all the  way do
wn.  Sanitary conditions is much to 
be desire d.  Was  going on li ke that , 
you know, for al most t w o ye ars unt
il it ca me , I suppose , the or der t o 
liquidate the ghetto.  When the  
order  ca me  t o liqui date t he ghett o, by that  ti me alr
eady we kne w where  the  rest of t he fa mili es we nt. 
Before that  already our  resistance
 formed in the ghett
o.  Res ista nce  c onsi ste d of people  that 
belonged to orga niza tions be for e 
t he  one s I  me nti one d pre viously.  Th
ey tried to organize, to some  
arma me nts, like guns, ammu nition. 
 I n fact  ma n y ti mes ,  me  bein g  
a ble  t o go out  by mysel f, they  
requi red my  help by bri ngi
ng in guns  that were  bo
ught  on the outside.  I helped them with that . 
Most of the people that
 belonge d to the or gani z ations  were  
in their twenties and they some how 
cont acted Warsaw and t h ey hear d wh
at was going on in Wa rsaw, ho
w they orga nized themse lves. 
They wanted to do the sa me thing there but it didn
't work out that way.  
Not too long before the  
liqui dati on of t he ghetto, the Ger m
ans knew exactly what was goi ng
 on.  I  suppos
e because there  
was a l ot of people, especially i n 
t he Jewish police, t hey
 hope d that they're  goi
ng t o sur vive  and t he y  
squealed.   They knew wh
ere t hey were and one da
y t hey came in in the gh
etto---.  One day they 
came  in the Germans, th
e SS and they knew exactly where th
e  under gr o und pe ople  wer e hiding. 
They put dynamite in one of the bui
l dings and t h ey ble w  
it up.  With that , th
e r esist ance collapsed 
and whoever  coul d, run out of the 
ghetto through the unde
rgr o und tunne ls, the wa
ter, the sewers and 
they disappeared.  Most 
of them we nt to the fore
st wher e the y or ga nize d the mse lve s a s part isa ns. 
The rest of us remained un
til the last minute until the 
liquidation of the ghetto.
 
 
So  you rema ined 
in the ghetto?
 
 

I remained in the ghetto until ab
out two weeks before the comple
te liquidation I 
was caught and I 
wa s s hi ppe d a wa y t o Es tonia .  I n Estoni a I  wa s  
there for abou t a year.  
In Estonia they call it 
wo rki ng  ca mp s,  it 's no
t liquidation camps, I me
an.  The r e were  numer ous wor king c a mps  in  
Est onia .   I  happene d  to be i n  se
ven of them.  I wa
s shi pped a r ound fr om one  
t o  the  ot her.  Then I  
me an the situation in the ca mps was not the sa me  like in the ghetto.
 
 
Wa s t his  bet wee n 1942 or
 '43? .  Is  tha t  right?
 
 
That was between 1943 
a nd '44.  The  liqui dati on of t he  ghett o  
wa s in '43.  The year I was there was 
fr om 1943 to '4 4.  Like I me n
tione d be for e, I  wa s i n  se ven di ffe r
ent  camps.  What I went  thr ough  
there and everybody wit h me
, it 's undescr ibable becaus
e- -jus t  to gi ve you a fo
r instance--.  Wh en it 
came first to one of the 
camps, was a transition  camp
.  There a couple of w
eeks  and the y se nd us out 
anot her  c a m p.  It  start ed out  to be
 col der  at  that  ti me, winter was 
approa c hing.  We  were gi ven, for 
the first time we were
 gi ven t he st ripe s, ja cket  
and the st ripe d pants .  The 
s h oes were woode n s hoes. 
The  wi nter  s t arted out  wi th snow 
and the snow 
ac c u mulat ed on the  s hoe s, you couldn't  walk.  It  was  
fr om one  ca mp t o t he ot her and 
one  ca mp be ca me--we we nt out  in 
the morning, we 
came back at  
night, the ca mp bur ne d do
wn co mplet ely.  Ther e was nowher es t o
 go.  No w this camp s, I contacted 
typhoi d agai n.  How I survi ved al most t hree hu
ndred--I t hi n k a t ent h, ten percent survived.  I 
reme mb er like today, it wa s on Ne
w Year 's Even, took the ten percent of us and they transported us 
fr om this camp to anothe
r.  One of t he cam
p s  we ca me , we  we
r e there t he l ongest;  we were about 
six mont hs t hat was bett er
 alr eady because each day 
when t h ey t ook us t o 
wor k, I used t o escape 
and ri fl e i n for mati on and went  to 
work and scrounged what
ever  I could i n order 
to survive.  Then 
be fore they came in, I me an came ba ck to the ghetto
, to the camp, I used to 
smuggle in and went t o  
the ghetto with them.  In
 the e nd , we  wer e  as  fa
r away as Narva (423) whic
h is a town not t oo far  
fr om Finla n d.  The n t he Russia ns star
ted to come closer an
d cl oser .  As t he y ca me close r , the y t ook 
a lot  of us  and tra nspor ted us ba
c k  to Ger many.  In f
act , they took a trans
port, if I remember  
corre ctly, for  about four  or five 
thous and and put us on a  shi p and 
t r anspor ted us all  the  wa y t o the  
Balti c Sea t o St uthof ( 4 32) which was conce ntra ti
on camp.  There were Germans, if I reme mber 
correctly, there were Ger mans stan
di ng there  ri ght on t he  dock.  
They were  be ggi
ng ar my they  
should take  them becaus e they felt that the Ru ssian
s were right there behind
 them.  They let them 
stay and the y took us  ins t
ead.  Why, I  never c oul d fi gur e out.  Th
e y brought us bac k t o Stut hof.  We  
wer e there i n Stut hof, 
it wa s a big c o nce ntrati on ca mp; we were
 there for  about six weeks.  They  
had us for m ed agai n br ooks and s e
nd us  into Ger ma n y,
 somewheres i n Ba va
ria, a place called 
Da umer _____-(44).  A t h ous
and pe ople.  Thi s  wa s t he  wors t of 
them all.  How I survived, I can't 
imagine to this da y.  There wasn't
 a  thing I  didn't  do i n  or der  to ge
t something extra to eat.  There 
you couldn't  go out, you coul dn't
 scrounge, you couldn't beg, you ha
d t o work.  Sa nitar y conditi on s  
were unbearable.  The place
 was just full of mud.  
If anybody wa s, le
t's say, a little bi
t weak and had 
to walk through the mud 
especially now when it 
got a little bit colder an
d the mud fr oze a little bit 
on t op.  I f anybody ha d t o 
walk there, to the latrine what they call it, a toilet, outside toilet and they 
sunk int o
 t h e mud, they coul dn't get  out .  The y 
died t her e on the spot.  
There were deat hs ever y 
singl e  da y a nd e very single  ni ght .  They had t he  la
trine in a barrack.  The 
barrack consisted, they 

use d to bri n g you l ater on more
 and more people, th
e  bar r ack c onsist e d of
 a thousand people 
approximately.  
There were a lot of nationalities brought 
in, Poles, Russians, 
people were dying 
there  li ke  fli es.  So i n  or der  to
 sur vive, there was a l atrine, it was like a wheel
barr ow e xce pt  withou t  
wheels ,  just  wit h ha ndl es .  The  fron
t handles in the back.  
People with all  kinds 
of diseases used to 
go t o t he l atr ine a nd they had to ha ve a coupl e of vo
lunteers to get it out this
 here  on t he outsi de  an d 
dump it.  I volunteer ed fo
r an extr a piece of bread.   This i s
 somehow how I sur v ived.  To t ell you  
about the sanitary conditions, ther
e were oper ations being per for me d 
and I  mean by Je
wis h doctor s , 
people had gangrene and all 
t hat  st uff, with r eal  butcher  kni ves.
  Didn't have no instrume nts, didn't 
have anesthesia.  The lice are cr
awling all around us. 
 They had one stove, a 
bi g st ove, a  pot- bell y 
stove in the middle of th
e barra ck.  Talking about  a  barrac k, it  
looked li ke  a hanger  a nd fro m bot h 
sides , it was  a-- sle epe d three r o ws , we slee pe d on s t
ra w, bunks .  I use d to go
 at night, used t o go 
down there t o t he stove, t he pot- bel
l y stove beca us e they ha d t o  us e 
a  lot  of coal .  The  st ove  was  re d 
hot , take  off my clot hes  a nd by the  st
ove, try to kill the lic
e.  I'm shivering while
 I'm talking about it 
beca use  i f I r e mi nd mysel f, it 's  no wonder.  
 
 
We 'll  st op and t urn
 the  ta pe over.
 
 
Okay.     ( E nd of Side A, Tape 
I) In t his camp I was ta
lking about, last poin
t out when I was there 
for about  nine mont hs .  On
e  da y, a  fe w months be fore  we  were  s h
ipped out  of t her e,
 all  of a sudden  
the conditions started to 
improve.  We  couldn't fi gure out why.
  We  found it out
 after we were 
liberat ed;  we found it  out what
 wa s happening. 
 Turns out Hi mm
ler was negotiati
ng with some 
Je wish or ga nizati on or wit h the 
Re d Cros s a bout a c ertai n a mount, 
to spare a cert ai n amount of 
Je wish, most ly ki ds for  
a  certai n a mo unt of mone y.  Beca use  th
ey already knew, t hey fi gur ed t hat 
the Third Reich is not going to la
st too long.  They 
were willing to show
 the Red Cross the 
conditions in certain camps 
how they are, not as bad 
as the whole world was ta
lking about.  So they  
started to improve the conditi
ons.  First of all, what they did is, 
t hey cleaned it  up. 
 For  insta nce ,  i n  
our camp like I told you, th
ere was mud mostly so th
ey ma de sidewalks out of
 planks  t h at you could 
wal k on.  They changed 
ever ybody's  _____(18); th
ey changed the cl othes 
and they se nd us , they 
bathed us a n d unl oused us, what  they
 call it.  In other wo
r ds, got ri d of the l ice; i mpr ove d t he  rati ons  
a little bit.  That it
self was a little bit help.  
Nobody came, nobody 
looked into it, until it came the  
ti me  they shi ppe d us out 
from t here and the main r eason t hey sh
ipped us out is bec aus e t he war  was  
closing in.  They tried to save  themselves; they tr
i ed to-- hope d to t ake  a  cer
tain amount of
 the, what 
they call  the hefli nger, wh
ich were us, the prisoners,
 together with them.  
They were talking about  
that in the Alps they had some 
tunnels in the mountain
s there and t hey would sur vive t here. They 
needed some  ______(29) to
 work for them.  They transported us--
first they brought 
us into Dachau. 
In Dachau, I  was t here for about  th
ree weeks.  As the Americans wa
s  c o mi ng cl oser  fr om the west  
and the south and th
e Russians from the east, litt
le by little, it got more 
and more dangerous for 
them and they transported us from 
Dachau.  In Dachau we were ther
e we weren't doing a thing.  We 
wer en't give n a nyt hing t o e at practi c ally and we
 wer en't doi ng-- we were una ble  be ca use  we didn't  
have no str e ngt h.  They t r ans port ed us by cattl e c ars
 of course, along towa rds 
the Al ps.  In May, it 
wa s April 30, 1945, May 1st,
 I remember like the day--.
  It  wa s a  ver y, ver y co
ld and snowy day.  It 

wa s coming down , snow wa s coming
 down, wet s now was  comi ng dow
n from April 30th at night to  
May 1st.  Ameri ca n pla n es  was  c o mi ng over hea d.  
We  woke  up on May 1s t, 
we  di dn't  find no more  
SS guards, they disappeared.  We  
were left  in our own. 
 It was a little town 
and the-- nearby was 
where  the  tra i n st oppe d.  
We were all started to walk towards it
 and tried to get so
me  clothing, some 
food, whate ver we  c oul d fr om t he Ger ma n popula
tion t her e.  The t own wa
s calle d Stat hga  (49) . 
Eve rybody more  or  les s  in gr oups
, I  was  in a  gr oup wi
t h another  four  guys
.  We  found a  place  
where t o sleep and we or gani zed so
me food and didn't ta ke t oo long
, the Ameri cans, the ar my, t hey 
ca me--t he  ki tche ns  with food.  Wit h speci al, i n ot
her  wor ds , t o del ous e  us  a gain, to cl ean us wi t h , 
like showers and st uff li ke 
that; with powders to clean
 us up a nd stuff like that
.  So me  of the people 
dispersed t h emselves in privat e 
hous es a nd took over  whe r e t he Ge
r mans lived.  Th
ey were more 
able t o do, s t ronger .  Some of t h
e m, like me , I didn't ha ve t h e stre
ngt h to stand on my feet .  I f I  
weighed 90 pounds, it was 
a l ot.  They gi ve us  food a nd t he  
food wa s very, very
 greasy, a lot of 
por k and stuff li ke  that .  People  be
ing hungry at e a nyt hing i n  si ght .  
They got diarr hea
 a lot of them,  
died fr om it.  How I surv
ived, I got diarrhea too, 
how I survived, I 
still don't know.  
I remember one 
thing--a bout  t wo nights  be for e  we  were  libe r ate d
, the  Re d Cr oss  dis perse d for  all  the se-- for  eac h 
one of us, a care package. 
 The care package if I reme mber corr
ectly--there was a ca
n of ham,  pie c e 
of chocolate and a pack of
 ci gar e ttes , Ca me ls.  I us
ed to smoke befor e.  I sa
w the Camel cigarettes; I 
starte d t o s moke .  I  t hought I '
m goi ng to di e.  I  mea n  ther
e was--too strong for me , too 
overpowering.  Anyhow, af
ter this, after the food 
and everything else, we 
were t here for about  six  
wee ks .   The y gat here d  us and the y  br ought  us, al
l of us, to a DP camp  
call e d Wel ___________( 78) . 
It 's not far fr om Munich and it used to be; there it
 used t o  be a Hitl er  Yout
h.  The y  ha d t heir ,  n o t  
hea dquarter s , I  woul d sa y, t heir  ba
rracks and st uff like that.  It  was 
nice ly built  and the y  br ought  us 
bac k t here  a nd from ot he r pa rts, t h
ey brought us  t oget her .  Quite a  fe
w thousa nd pe opl e.  I n t his  DP 
camp we started to get together ba
ck our lives, little by little.  I was 
there for fo ur years, fr om 1945, 
I woul d sa y, J une 1945 un
til about April 1949. 
 In this camp, peop
le st arted to court, a lot of them 
starte d to get  marrie d.  We di d get mar r ied i n 1946 a
nd start ed t o live mor e or 
less a nor mal  li fe.  By  
nor mal , I mean t hey us e d to give us  rations there . 
 The rations weren't suffic
ient so we tried to do 
some bl ack- mar ket eering, as
 they call it, in order to
 ha ve  s o met hing mor e to
 eat.  But 
we enj oye d  
ourselves t h ere, the coup
le of year s we were t h
ere.  We decided, my 
wi fe  and I  deci ded, we 
shouldn't  ha ve any c hildren on the 
Ge
rman soil and I we nt to a sc
hool  t here  and t rie d t o le arn a  
trade.  She wa s working there in 
a, what you cal l it, a 
se wi ng pla ce  wher e  the y  made various t hi ngs  
for--I don't  know what for,
 honestly, but she was occupied.  It  
was a carefree l i fe yo
u mi ght  say, for 
three  or  four years .  But  we  trie d,
 fro m t h e  fi rst  m o ment  o n
, we trie d t o get  out of
 there.  We  tried to 
emigrate.  At that time
, it started out with th
e illegal immigration to Is
rael and a lot of people  
deci ded t o  go to Israel .  In fact
, we  had fr iends that we
 li ved t oget her  a n d the y  decided to go t o  
Israel in 1947 that 
the y went.  They went wit h  the  Exodus  an
d t hey were  s ent ba ck to Cyprus  a nd al l  
that stuff.   Being that my  wi fe
 ha d here  fa mil y , and fa mily fro m
 before the war.
  She had a fe w 
uncl es, he r mother 's  br others  and 
s h e als o had fa mi l y i n Ar genti n
a.  We tried to get from them 
papers  se nt  t o us  s o we can i m mi gra t e t here .   
I n  Ar genti na , Ar genti na  di dn't allow a nyt hing, a ny  
i mmi grati on, so t hey got  us  papers  t o i m mi grat e  
to Para gua y.  We were n'
t  too anxious about  it . 
The n her uncles tri ed t o get us paper s to i m mi gra t
e to the United States. 
 Finally it came Truma n  
and pas se d a  law and Congre ss where  
ever yone fr om the survi vors , fr om
 the DP camps, as long as i t  
wa sn't a  underworld pers on or  s o

 anything like it,

Members of my family, while we were ther e, in
 W_______ DP camp, there 
was always  lists right 
fr om the first mo me nt on.
  There wer e lists circul ating among 
all the DP camps b
ecause there was a 
lot of DP camps allover  Ger many.  People th
at  wer e liberat ed i n Pola nd or a ny ot he r part s of--
Romani a, Czechosl ova
ki a or  any ot her parts--t hese li sts ci
rculated.  When t he circulated people 
were l ooking for t he rel a tives who 
have survived--stuff lik
e t h at.  I n my ca se, for  i nsta n ce, I ha d my  
brother was in Russia;
 he was sent away in Russi
a, in Siberia.  Because 
he was a Polish citizen, you 
might say, in Poland 
became a communist country so they allo
wed all the Polish c
itizen to go back 
to Po land.  Of course, he regist
ered hi msel f ri ght  away and he 
ca me back.  Wher
e  di d he  come  
back? to Wilna, not 
knowing what happened.  Wh
en he came back 
in Wilna, he found my father 's 
brot her , my uncl e , he  wa s 
there.  Onc e he  found hi
m, he alr ea d y st uc k with 
hi m t oget her .  Then the y 
closed t he border  and th
ey ma de  Wi lna part of Lithua nia, a  
republi c wi th Lithuania  but  als o a  
repu blic o f Ru ssia .  Be f ore t hey
 closed t he bor der, t hey let hi m 
go bac k  to Pol and.  Wher e they  
came, t hey came t o  the t o wn 
of Lodz .  Ther e my uncle , he  lost  hi
s famil y before, he 
lost in the sa me 
ti me  t hat  my mot her  and all  the 
ot her chil dre n peris he d, he  lost  
hi s  whole  fa mil y  t oo, he  found 
so me one  in Wil na , h e  re mar r ied . 
 The thre e of the m looke d a nd t hey
 found the  na me s 
of me , that I 
wa s in a camp in Germany, a DP camp.  My father
, again, he was also li
ber ated i n one  of t he 
concentr ation camps, 
I  think it  was  M authaus en.  He  we nt bac k
 t o  Pola nd.  Ove r  
t here  he  found out  
that I was liberated in 
Germany.  A group, a 
couple of the wome
n or me n, I don't 
know exactly how 
ma ny, t he y t ried to go, a t  tha t  
ti me already, the border s were fo
rmed, they tried 
t o go fr om one  
bor der  to the other .   Fr om Pola nd 
t o  Aust ria, from Austria. I thi n
k, to Italy, fr
o m It al y some how 
they got her e to Ger ma n y.  Bec aus
e they knew I  was t her
e.  He  came  and then
 my brothe r c a me. 
My uncle  de cide d t o  sta y  in Lodz. 
 He was there, in fact he was 
up to 1960 until  he, le gally, my 
fat her  br ought hi m i n, br ought  hi m 
back.  This  is  how we got  toget h
er-- my father, my older br other  
and me -- we got t ogether  in a DP 
ca mp in Ger many.  Then
 i n 1949, I was t h e fi
rst one , my wi fe a nd 
I, were the first ones to emigrate to the United St
ates.  Then t hey came af
terwards i n 1950.  M y  
wi fe , agai n, she  was  wit h her younger si ster .  Th
ey we re t he  onl y t w o s ur v

was with her in all 
the  c a mps t ogether, never se
parated.  The y got li berat ed t oget her .  They ca me  
together  in the sa me  ca mp that  I 
was, they brought them there.  Th
at 's  how we  got  a cquainte d.  We  
got  marrie d i n 1946 and we  
came  back here in 1949.
 
 
You ca me  to Ne w York?
 
 
At fir s t,  we ca me t o Bo s t on an

We  couldn't stay too long,

Little by little, I

What  di d you do?
 
 
I worked in a supermar ket.
  I worked nearby and alwa

We  were there for a

 We  went to a better neighborhood,

one  of us.  Each one  has  a partic ular  s tory t o  tell .  
This is the main incident 
t hat  I  can never  er ase it  
fr om my mind, knowing es
pecially where they are 
buried.  Imagine till abou
t a year or two ago,  
there was no mention especially 
fr om the  Russi ans, t hat  so ma ny
 Je wi s h wer e buri ed t here  a nd 
especiall y fr om the Lit huanians. 
 A c o uple of year s  ago, a yea r  or

on the site.  For th
e first time , they recognized 
t hat so ma ny, I  th

eventuall y  it  came t o  the poi nt 
where the Russians we re closing i n 
so t hey got Jewi sh prison
ers who dug the m out , al l 
these bones and t hey buried the m i n pil es t hat  
not hing should re ma in t here .   I n  ot her  wor ds , t h
ere shouldn't be anything
 to accuse t hem of or 
somet hing li ke t hat .  It 's more or  
les s the sa me  st or y li ke Babi  Yar .
