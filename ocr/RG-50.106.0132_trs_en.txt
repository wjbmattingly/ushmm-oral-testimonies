A: Yes. I think both my mother™s and my fath
er™s family, I can trace them back to the 
grandparents and maybe even th e great gran
dparents. I™m not sure about the great 
grandparents. 
Q: Do you know wh ere those prev io
us generations then came from? 
A: No.

rk did your father do? 
A: My father was the head of a factory. 
He was awa -- th int -- th
e -- the actual title 
was

factory. It was a factory of enamel, but it was a conglomerate and there were 

factories all over 
Europe
 by the same conglom -- owned by the same conglomerate.

ed. She -- we had a lot of

belonged to several societie

Q: What kind of educati
on did your father have?

kind of schooling.

Q: Did you have many extended family 
in the area? Aunts, uncles, cousins? 
A: Okay . My mo ther had two sisters and a br
other. One of the sisters at the time lived 
in 
Czechoslovakia
, and the other sister did live in 
Vienna
. In fact, we were very 
close with that sister -- with that sister™s
 children. She had two daughters and my  two 
cousins were -- one was three years older 
than my  sister and the other one was 
another three years older. And one of 
the sisters always -- the younger one, 
Susie
, 
who now lives in
 Israel
, went every year with us to a vacation. 
Q: So you had close relations
hips with your cousins. 
A: Yes, with that -- with only that cous
in. My mo ther™s brother had no ch ildren, my  
mother™s other sister h ad no children, so 
these were our only cousins. From what I 
recollect, I had two grandmot
hers, both grandfathers had 
been dead, and I think one 
of them died wh en I was probably about 
four years old. My
 other grandmother, 
which was my  maternal grandmother was ve
ry -- she was with us a lot. She went 
away with  us every single summer, and I saw quite a bit of her. 
Q: Tell me about the neighbor
hood that you lived in in  
Vienna. 
A: I lived in a -- it was called the fourth district. We -- we had -- we rented -- I don™t 
think we owned it. We rented an apartmen
t which was huge. It -- it went the whole 
length of the building. I was lu
cky enough to get a picture of
 the building, I forgot to 
bring it. And -- 

Q: Remember what street it was o n ? 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg 
July 29, 2000

A: Yes, the name of the street was 
Winnersal
 
strasse.
 I forgot the number now, but I 
was able to relocate the number through some
 of the documents that I found in my  
mother™s portfolio, where my 
mu  -- wh ere my  mo th er kep t 
all her documents. It -- it 
looked out on a little plaza. So
 when I went back to 
Vienna
, I -- I tried to find it and I 
-- actually I couldn™t recognize the house 
because the bottom of the house had been 
changed. It -- it became more commercial 
now, they have like shops and shops™ 
windows on the bottom, but the top floor seem
s to be the same th
at we lived on. And 
we probab ly had approximately, I don™t kno
w, about 15 - 20 rooms. It was a very 
extens -- because our -- some of our staff lived
 with us and the rest of the staff u sed 
to come in, like the laundress and the seamstre
ss and the tutors, they just came  in and 
left. 
Q: And what other kind of staff did your parents have? 

A: Okay , we had a cook and we had a maid
 and we had a governess and they  lived 
with us. The chauffeur did not. 
Q: So you also had a car. 
A: Yes, we had a car. 

Q: Sounds like it was an upper cl
ass family that you were born into. 
A: I guess so. I would say so, yeah. Actua
lly, the real upper class was my -- my 
grandmother™s brother, who had -- who was th
e president of the southern railroad at 
the time, an d he was really what we call,
 almo st like an aris
tocrat. He had an

incredible apartment that he
 used to have guided tour
s in because it was full of 
beautiful, very precious painti
ngs and fu rniture and so on. 
Q: What was his name ? 
A: His name was 
Gustav Fall
, and he had a monument erect
ed in his honor in front 
of a hotel that the railroad owned, wh
ich was on the bu -- 
mountain outside of 
Vienna
, it was called 
Zemmerin g
. I don™t think the monument exists any mo re, I 
know the hotel does not and I know th at they have some kind of vaca -- rec -- 

recreational facilities th ere now. 
Q: How religious was your family? 

A: Not very religious. We did -- we -- we 
-- we were part of the Jewish community 
and we did go to  temp le, but 
only on high holidays. On  th
e other hand, we did have a 
Christmas tree, supposedly for the staff, to
 honor them. I remember going to temple. I 
tried to find the te
mple when  I was in 
Vienna
, but the only temple that we located 
was one that was closed. And later on wh en  I 
talked to one of my distant relativ es, I 
was told that there were several temples 
and that probab ly wa
s not the one that I 
attended as a child.  

Q: Mm-hm. Did you celebrate any Jewish holidays at home? 
A: No, we did not have Frid
ay night candle lights or a
nything like that. The only -- 
we did in  a sense, Yom Kippur, because 
he -- my father always fasted on Yom 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg 
July 29, 2000

Kippur, this was one thing that he did. An
d so did my  mo ther and I guess so did we 
as children. Later on, of course, that was no longer done. 
Q: Did th ey come from religious families, your parents? 
A: I don™t think so -- I think the Au strian
 -- I -- I don™t know. I -- I don™t think so. I 
don™t rememb er my  grandmother being -- br
inging up religion in  any way. We did 
have religious training though, but th
e religious training came because in 
Vienna
 at 
the time religion was part of
 the curriculum, and since we
 were Jewish, that was not 
given in the schools. So  I rememb er we had a Hebrew teacher coming to  the house, 
teaching us Hebrew and religion. 

Q: Did you exchange Christma
s presents amongyourselves? 
A: I don™t think so. I think the presents we
re mostly for the staff. B u t I also don™t 
reme mb er an y  
Hanukah
 big gifts. Frankly, 
I don™t remember presents as such as part 
of a traditional festivity. I know I got my
 first gold ring because I ate some meat, 
which I refused to eat previ
ously. And I remember that wh
en ever my  parents went to 
Paris
, because my mother bought 
most of her wardrobe ther
e, they would bring us 
back -- and clothes were always uppermind -- 
in my mind, even as a little girl, and I 
reme mb er that. But I -- I -- I don™t reme mb
er any presents as such that were 
particularly meaningful to me
. I remember as a little girl 
I had little dolls that I liked. 
And I think when  
Hitler
 came I could take a few with me, I don™t rememb er. But 
somehow they disappeared. But I don™t reme
mb er like having had a specific toy that

I was attached to, like my little gr
anddaughter now is with -- with 
Minnie Mo use.
 I -
- I don™t rememb er that. Maybe I blacked it out. I -- I can™t reme mber. 
Q: Did you have a Passover 
Seder
? 
A: No. And if we did, I don™t remember it. 

Q: Let™s talk about your schooling. 
What kind of school did you go to? 
A: Okay , we went -- we did not attend priv
ate school, we attended the public school, 
and I remember the greatest embarrassment 
was that we were brought there with the 
car and the chauffeur and I 
was very embarrassed about not
 being able to walk to 
school like the other children. I was never a
llowed to even cross the street by myself 
or walk any place by myself. My biggest plea
sure was that my mother once took me 
on th e bus. That was a big excitement for me
 because the car I -- I kind of disliked 

riding in  the car, because I used to get carsick a lot.  

Q: Would you say th at your parents were 
overly protective, or was this the usual 
way? 
A: That -- that was the usual way that the g
overnesses an d in the circle of friends that 
we grew up with. But y -- then
 most of the -- I -- I can™t 
rememb er why we did not go 
to private school, but most of the children 
of my fr -- of my fa
ther™s and mother™s 
friends did attend private school
. We did go to a private 
dancing school, and we did 
have piano lessons in the house with a pi
ano teacher. But I -- and I also remember 
coming to th e house, we had th e governesses 
that were supposed 
to instruct us in

French and English, but we also had some 
kind of a tutor come to the house for the 
languages. But noth ing mu ch came of it. 
Q: What kind of relationship di
d you have with your sister? 
A: My sister was very domineering, very bo
ssy, and my  father clearly always favored  
my  sister, which was a big problem for me 
as a child because I felt he was very 

unjust. And in 
Vienna
 the oldest child had a lot of 
privileges that the younger child 
didn™t have. So I was very 
annoyed at that. She was allo
wed to go at night to  the 
opera, I was not. She was allowed to go to 
bed later, I was not. She was allowed a lot 
of fe -- also , I had a lot of hand-me-down 
dresses from her, which I terribly resented. 
And I always wanted  to have the same cl
othes as she did, I was dreaming of her 
being left back in school so we could 
be in the same grade. Things like that. 
Q: What -- how would you desc
ribe yourself? What kind of
 a child were you? Were 
you quiet, or mo re outgoing? 

A: I was a very, very  noisy  child. The way 
we were brought up, 
we were not allowed 
to speak at the dinner table. I was not allo
wed to come to the big dinner table ovi -- 
until I knew how to cut my 
own meat, or -- an-and use 
the fork prop
erly. I -- my 
father even got a record on
ce because we were not allowe
d to talk unless talked to, 
and he once made a record
 on the phonograph saying
, Dorrit
 eat, 
Dorrit
 eat, 
Dorrit
 
don™t talk, 
Dorrit
 don™t talk. And that™s how it wa
s. And I had endless hours as a 
child that I remember of eating in my room
. I hated to eat and I 
would push the food

from one ch eek to th e other. And I had an un
cle who always touched me at the cheek 
and said for me to eat. And I would fore
ver sit and eat, from morning to night, 
because I was underw eight, I had asthma 
-- I was an asthmatic child, and the 
governesses were told that we had to eat, that
 I particularly had to eat. So they  kept 
me at the table s -- what seem
s to me still hours and hours.
 Like breakfast went into 
the snack, the snack went into
 the -- the midday meal, and the midday meal went into 
the afternoon meal and so on.  
Q: What -- be-because of your asthma
 were you on medication or anything? 
A: Yes, I was on medication. I had wh at they
 call an inhaler and I wasn™t allowed to 
run, and I wasn™t allowed to exercise t
oo much. As a privilege therefore, in the 
summers my mo ther just took me to the bath
s, the spas and I had all kinds of -- of 
these mineral water baths and mud bath
s that were suppos
ed to help me. 
Q: Who were your friends? Did you 
have friends in the neighborhood? 
A: No, there was no such things as friends
. We had friends that were my mother™s 
and father™s friends who had ch ildren. We
 had -- the only set of friends that I 
remember were two boys, and I absolutely 
detested the younger one, because he was 
my age, and adored the older one, who wa
s supposedly my sister™ s friend. But the 
only friends we really had was my sister ha
d my  cousin as a friend. But I was always 
relegated to my  grandmother and to the 
governess and I don™t rememb er any play 
dates or playing with any friends.

Q: Did you know you were 
Jewish, and if so, what did that mean to you? 
A: I definitely knew I was Jewish. It meant 
to me that I went to
 the temple, it meant 
to me that I had to have the 
private instruction. It meant 
to be -- to be excluded while 
the -- while the other children in
 the elementary school had their Catholic instruction. 
And I knew I was Jewish. It didn™t mean a gr
eat deal, I th ink, as far as tradition. And 
as a child, until the 
Hitler
 came to 
Vienna
, I was totally unaware of the antis -- anti-
Semitism that must have exis
ted at that time already. 
Q: What did you do in school when the 
other children went to their Christian 
education?  
A: I don™t remember w h at they made us do
. I don™t remember. All I know is that we 
did not participate, and therefore we
 had to  study Hebrew at home.  
Q: Did you sense anything among the teache
rs or the other students about your being 

different? 

A: No, No. I -- I reme
mber -- a-as I said, I w as not -- I was a very vivacious child, I 
was a very talkative child, and I rememb er being reprimanded for that. And I 

remember that I -- I had friends in the cla
ss. I don™t reme mb er 
them as such, but I 
remember sitting with them a
nd wanting to be with them. 
Q: Were your parents Zionists? 

A: No, neither my father nor
 my s -- my -- my 
mother were Zionists. The closest I 
came to the Zionist exposure was that I kne
w that my  older cousin , not my  younger

cousin, started being in that 
group just before we left 
Vienna
. I™m not totally sure 
that I knew of it while I was in 
Vienna
, or whether it was told to me later. 
Q: Were your parents a-active politically? 
A: No, no, not at all. Not at 
all. Not that I know of, anyway. 
Q: Had you heard ab -- preceding 1
938, had you heard 
of a man named
 Hitler
? 
A: Before that? 
Q: Right. 
A: I don™t remember. I must have, but I don™t
 remember. I know we
 -- in the group of 
friends that my father had, we identified ou
rselves as Austrians. My father was very 
proud to have fought in the 
first World War as an Austrian
 -- I think he was a captain 
or a lieutenant or something like that, and 
he had many decorations. And he was very 
proud of being Austrian, mu ch mo re
 so, I think, than  being Jewish. 
Q: And that infiltrated to you? You felt more Austrian than Jewish, a-as a young 

child?  
A: I think as a young child I didn™t feel eith
er way. I really didn™t. I was much more 
preoccupied  of wh at was happening at home 
with my sister, with
 my cousin, with -- 
with the governesses, who really f -- always favored my sister because she was quiet 

and I was very noisy. I still 
remember my father saying, 
we can only hear one child 
in this whole house and that™s me. An
d I -- I remember I was very grega -- 
gregarious. I know we were re -- presen
ted when -- whenever 
my  fath er an d  my  

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg

mo ther had big social affairs in the house 
in the evening, we were all dressed up and 
presented, and I loved that, because ever
ybody made a fuss over me. And th en of 
course, my  sister hated to go and she was fo
rced to go. And I also remember th at my 
sister was allowed to have long curls a
nd I was not because my mother felt all th e 
attention went to me a
nd not to my sister.  
Q: What was your relationship with your mo th er? 
A: Very close. I™m -- since my
 father favored so much my
 sister, my mother favored 
me. But truthfully, while we were in 
Vienna
, we were very little involved with either 
parent. We were strictly with the govern
ess and th ere were maybe not -- just maybe 
at the mealtime, the main mealtime at noo
n, that we sometimes ate with them, not 
always. And on Saturday and Sunday, I reme
mber a little bit of my father playing 

with us, maybe. A very little, very little inte
rplay. And then the summer we hardly 
ever saw them because they went on trips 
from the place where we always went to 
for the summer, which was a small es
tate where we rented a villa. 
Q: Where was that? 

A: That was near
 Salzburg
. It was in 
Unter achem arta za y
. It was a lake. And it 
was a beautiful, what I recollect as big estate
. My sister later -- la
ter told me it was a 
small one. And we had a boat 
house and my father had a 
cousin that owned a house 
further down the lake, whom we saw also, socially. But my parents were there not

13
that much. They usually took 
off on their own vacation, a
nd we were left with my 
grandmother, my  cousin and th e govern ess. 
Q: Did you have any favorite songs as a young ch ild? 
A: As a young child, I don™t reme mb er. I 
don™t -- oh yes, I -- I remember my uncle 
singing to me, but it wasn't n
ecessarily my favorite song. He 
used to sing to us one of 
-- of the -- of the 
Schiller
 poems, the -- it™s called the 
earl
 -- the 
Earl Kernik
, it™s -- 
it™s about a man that rides on a horse with a 
small child who™s -- who is dying, but he 
always changed the ending an
d we always knew this wasn
™t the ending, because the 
ending goes that he has his s
on, he holds his son, who is
 dead in his arms, and my  
uncle used to sing and they ate together a 
bread of -- of butter and bread. And I hated 
that, because I knew it was fake. 
Q: Can you sing a few lines? 

A: I know the poem, I can™t sing 
[recites poem in German]
 Something like that. 
Q: What language did yo
u di -- speak at home? 
A: We spoke exclusively German, and the on
ly other language my  -- the govern esses 
were supposed to teach us 
French and English and we kn
ew -- we learned abso lutely 
nothing. I don™t remember anything. Oh , in 
English I knew there wa
s a little girl that 
had curl right in her fi -- forehead, and if 
she was bad, she was very, very bad. That™s 
about it. 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg

Q: All right. Now, you said you don™t know
 if you remembered hearing ab out a man 
named
 Hitler
 before he came into 
Austria
. Let™s move up to that time. What is the 
first memory you have of that? 
A: My first recollection is of terror, actually
. We all went with that family that -- 
where I hated the two boys. We went in a 
-- on an afternoon -- actually no, the very 
first recollection 
is a radio when  
Hitler
 first entered
 Vien na
, and the -- the reception 
that he got and the -- th e ovation th at he got entering 
Vienna
. 
Q: Did your fami ly go to see him?  
A: No, no. 

Q: Did you know an ybody who 
went to see him come in ? 
A: No, no. The second recollec
tion was that we went to the 
pratta , 
which is the big 
amusement park and it™s also a park where y
ou can walk , and so on and so forth. And 

it was that the f -- the four of us, our fa
mily and the other family, we were just 
walking. And th en we were suddenly brought 
into a -- into a line, we were lined up. I 
don™t remember how they identified us as 
Jews, we -- it could be that we already 
wore the yellow sign naming us
 as Jews, but I™m not sure. But somehow we were put 
in that line, and my father somehow had 
his decorations from first w o rld -- from the 
first world one with him, and I don™t know 
by what miracle he 
convinced one of the 
men to let us go, our family and the other fa
mily. And we then hear
d that that -- that

that whole procession had to go to a mo
nument and clean the mo nument on their 
knees and then they  were just deported.
 So  it was a very frightening experience. 
Q: How did your parents explain it to
 you, you were eight years old. 
A: I don™t think they  explaine
d anything. They  explain -- my
 father then disappeared, 
he went we -- he -- he had to leave immedi
ately, it™s actually th
e chauffeur that was 
hiding him because they were 
looking for him, since he was a -- an important figure 
in the factory, and he went to 
Paris
. And then my  next recolle
ction is that we were 
packing and we had these big trunks and my  
sister and I were pl
aying hide and seek, 
and my  uncle drew me out, 
stood me up and he said, yo
u children, can™t you help 
your mo ther, instead you™re play ing th ese st
upid games, and she™s -- there™s a lot of 
trouble, and you really have to behave 
now. So that™s what I remember, and the 

excitement of leaving, yet I was 
totally aware that
 when  we left 
Vienna
, which was 
maybe a month or two later, we got an exit visa to go to 
Paris -- 
Q: This was a month or two after 
Hitler
 came in? 
A: I guess maybe if -- I™m not s -- exactly
 sure of the time, maybe two months, I 
don™t know, as a child you -- 

Q: But -- but co -- soon after? 
A: Soon after. I remember on the train -- 
Q: Okay, le-let™s back
 up for a little bit -- 
A: Okay .

Q: -- before -- before you leave 
Vienna
. You said you had to wear something, a sign, 
a yellow sign saying that you were Jewish. 
Do you have any recollection what it felt 
like to wear that and what your first reaction was? 
A: No, must be blocked out. I remember it 
-- again having to w
ear it, I think, in 
Yugoslavia
 when  
Hitler
 came to
 Zagreb
 where we were. So I think we had to wear 
it twice. I rememb er then being shocked 
that I saw it on baby carriages. I don™t 
remember any reaction, we just wore it. 

Q: Did you talk things over with  your sist
er -- no, I™m talking about early on, when 
you™re still in 
Vienna
 and 
Hitler
 had co me in. 
A: No, not really. I remember
 as a chil -- the only real re
collection I had was that I 
really didn™t want to be different, that
 I know. And I was -- I was very unhappy 
having to  be different. I was very unhappy 
to leave my room. I 
reme mb er leav in g  th e 
room, I went out on the balcony and I told  
my self, reme mb er ex act
ly what this place 
looks like because you may not remember it
. And for years afterwards I would recall 
that picture in my  mind, that™s why I was 
so sure I would recollect my house, but I 
didn't . And I would recollect the exact positio
n my bed was in -- in the room that my 
sister and I shared, and that was somehow comforting to me. 

Q: Were there any other changes in
 your life while you were still in
 Vienna
, after 
Hitler
 came in? 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg 
July 29, 2000 

 

 
 
17
A: Yes, we no lo nger went to
 school, we had to be -- be to -- we were taken out from 
school. We were taking of -- taken out of 
all the tutoring and all those schools, and I 
guess we just prepared 
[indecipherable]
 departure. 
Q: What were your thoughts when  they to ld
 you you couldn™t go to school an y mo re? 
A: I ge -- probably I was pleased. 
Hitler™s 
a b ig holiday. And then
 when we went to 
Paris
 we didn™t go to school at all. We agai
n had some French lessons, but it -- it was 
just a total holiday. And we loved 
France
 because that was the first time my mother 
was in charge of us and we drove her nuts, my sister and I. 

Q: Were there any other restrictio ns in 
Vienna
 besides no schooling? 
A: I™m sure there were and I™m sure that 
we were very careful where we went and 
what we -- what streets we went to or if we went out at all.

Q: This is a continuation of the 
United Sta tes 
Holocaust Memorial Museum 
volunteer collection interview with 
Dorrit Ostberg
. This is tape numb er one, side
 B
. 
And you were talking about your re
collections of restrictions in 
Vienna.
 
A: Unfo rtunately I don™t rememb er too many 
restrictio ns, but there are certain events 
that I recollect vividly. One of them was 
that we could use my  
great-uncle™s box at 
the opera, he had his own box, and we went
 out to an afternoon performance, while 
my sister  was allowed to go
 to the evening pe
rformance. And I -- I remember ce-cer -

- certain music li -- I remember a party that
 was given for my sister with -- where a 
whole slew of people came in with mari
onettes and they  gave a wh ole -- a marionette 
performance, was a big party for her birthday.
 We mu st have had at least 50 children 
or so. 

Q: Was this after 
Hitler
 came in? 
A: No, all before, all before 
Hitler. 
But I -- I don™t remember any specific 
restrictions. Maybe I blocked that kind of thing out. 
Q: Then you said, soon after 
Hitler
 came in your father made arrangements to leave. 
What did he say to you that he would have
 to leave, why he would have to leav e? 
A: He never spoke to  us about it, never e
xplained anything to us. I don™t re -- the -- 
there were never such  discussions, neither 
with my mother, nor 
with my father. We 
were just told we had to leave, we had 
to behave because they were very difficu lt 
times and that was it. 
Q: Were you upset when your father left? 
A: No, didn™t bother me at 
all because he was very often gone. We were really not 
taken care of by either my father, nor my
 mother. They were 
like visitors, I would 
say. 

Q: Mm-hm. Yo-You described before that 
very moving scene of going -- of trying to 
reme mb er your room. That was a very matu
re response for a young child, to realize 
that she ma y never see her room again. 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg 
July 29, 2000 

 

 
 
19
A: I guess so, but I was a very dramatic ch
ild. I -- I reme mb er we were exposed  to 
theater and many of the plays when  we we
re up in the country, and I -- I remember 
the excitement of these -- in
 -- in the performances in 
Vienna
, at any of the theater 
performances or operas, they had several curt
ains before they went up. And I vividly 
remember the excitement betw
een the curtains and I couldn
™t wait for them to go up 
and -- and I even, as a child, had dreamsof performances. Dreams of -- of theater 

performances, mu sic performances. Of course, I was exposed  mainly to classical 
mu sic, but I loved, actually, the mu sic th
at -- that -- Viennese music -- now I 
recollect, because you asked me before. An-And
 we used to go on 
-- in the afternoon 
we used to go on many of the walk s where 
there was mu sic played
 in the background 
and I guess little coffee shops or things lik
e that. And I loved that, I -- I was very 
impressed with that, mu
ch more so than with
 the classical music. 
Q: You said you were a dramatic child, 
wh at did the German uniforms look like to 
you wh en  you were in 
Austria
? 
A: Not frightening, they were 
just unifo rms, and I had seen pictures of my  father in 
the unifo rm for the World War One, a
nd th-the -- and I was exposed to many 
uniforms that -- that people wore, I gue
ss. Passing by, or things like that. 
Q: When it was time to leave and you were 
packing th e trunks an
d so forth, did you 
take anything sp ecial with you? 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg 
July 29, 2000 

 

 
 
20
A: I just remember th ose little dolls. That™s about all that I rememb
er, if I took them. 
As I said, we had no, that I recollect, I wa
s n o t attached to a specific blanket, to a 
specific toy. It™s unusual because I see my  son 
carried his blanket for years. It™s -- it™s 
strange.  
Q: And when it was time to go, what ki
nd of arrangements were made? This was 
you, your mo ther and your sister? 

A: Yes. The three of us went on a train,
 and I remember I -- at the time I already 
wrote a diary. And I wrote -- I -- I was look
ing -- I -- I stayed up as long -- we had 
sleeping cars, and I rememb er going through 
Switzerland
, wh ich I had never been, 
and I was very interested in how 
Switzerland
 looked through the train windows and 
I wrote in my  diary that I was going th rou
gh that. But I was terri
fied of being taken 
off the train, and somebody coming and not 
letting us leave. I knew that we had to 

leave, and I knew it was dangero us if we couldn™t st -- to stay. 

Q: How did you know it was dangerous? 
A: I don™t know. Probably through listening to
 the reports, hearing the adults speak, 
hearing -- probably, I would assume now that
 most of our staff was let go before we 
left. I don™t reme mb er. 

Q: Now, what about your ex te
nded family? Th
ey stayed in 
Vienna
 when you three 
left? 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg 
July 29, 2000 

 

 
 
21
A: My grandmother stayed, and my  cous
ins were sent on a child transport to
 
England
. My two cousins. And my mother™s 
sister, with her husband went to 
America
. My uncle had a brother in 
America
 who sponsored hi
m and gave him a 
visa and they went th ere. And 
th at was my  i mmed i ate f a mily .  
Q: So your immediate family seemed
 to get aw -- have gotten out of 
Vienna
 early. 
A: Yes, yes, except for my grandmother. 
Q: She stayed. 
A: She stayed. She had to stay. 
Q: Why did she have to  stay? 

A: Well, she couldn™t come with us, and -- 
Q: Why not? 
A: I guess my  father couldn™t get a visa fo
r her. And I -- I know later on, when we 
were in 
Yugoslavia
 and my  father had an
 opportunity
 to go to  
America
, my  mo th er 
refused, because she said she wouldn™t leave 
Europe
, because of her mother was still 
in 
Euro pe
. And I do remember th at I 
always wanted to  go to 
America
 as a kind of 
savior. So I -- I was very 
much aware of the danger. 
Q: Did -- did -- did it manifest itse
lf, your aw areness, in any way? 
A: I guess so. I mean, when we went to 
Yugoslavia
, first we went to 
Slavonski 
Brod
, where my father took over another fact
ory, and there we lived again in  -- in 
great luxury, and --

Q: Well, okay, let™s talk a little ab out -- you 
were on the train, and you were going to 
Paris
? 
A: Correct. I™m skipping. And then in 
Paris
 -- my father was no longer in 
Paris
, my 
father already had left for 
Yugoslavia
 to take over the factory, and they left my 
mother and my sister and I 
in an apartment and later 
on a distant cousin of my  
father™s, who was much young
er, she was at the time a y o
ung woman, lived with us 
for a little while. 
Q: And what did you do a
nd how long were you in 
Paris
? 
A: I think we were about 
six or seven months in 
Paris, 
and we did a lot. We went to 
the opera in 
Paris
, we went to the museums, we went
 to the stamp ma
rket. My sister 
had an extensive, beautiful stamp collec
tion, and -- which later was sold, and we 
lived off that stamp collection for a little wh
ile, it -- it -- but we
 also didn™t go to 
school, we had private instruc
tion in French . And we had a 
holiday, we didn™t have to 
go to  school, we didn™t have to be tutored 
all day long, we had a very  structured  life 
in 
Vienna
. 
Q: In -- in
 Paris. 
A: No, in  
Vienna
, which was totally free, in a sense in 
Paris. 
Q: Oh, I see, mm-hm. And your mother 
obviously had enough money to live in 
Paris
. 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg 
July 29, 2000 

 

 
 
23
A: Oh yeah, because my
 father took over the factory in -- in 
Yugoslavia
 and we must 
have had plenty of money. 
Q: Did your relationship with
 your mother change once yo
u didn™t have a governess?  
A: Yes, as I said, we drove my mother cr
azy. We invented all kinds of languages she 

wouldn™t understand, we were fighting who 
would have the last word in bed. We -- 
we -- we were just children, trying to -- fee
lin g our oats the first time really that we 
didn™t have the strict contro l, and the 
strict schedule that we were used to. 
Q: Had you heard any mo re about 
Hitler
 while you were in
 Paris
? 
A: Definitely, yes. There were neighbors of
 ours that I remember, th e neighbors were 
also Jewish and I -- from
 Austria
 and I remember the man saying, the only way I 
ever return to
 Vienna
 is with a big knife. And we 
certainly knew about all the 
advances of
 Hitler,
 but we left
 Paris
 before
 Hitler 
conquered 
France
. We then went 
to stay in th -- w
ith my father in 
Yugoslavia
. 
Q: So you said you were in 
Paris
 for approximately six months, which means when  
you left it was early winter ™39. 

A: That™s -- 

Q: Is that correct? 
A: That™s about correct. Eith
er early winter or spring. We -- we could have stayed 
about four months maybe, in 
Paris
 because we were waiting to get the entrance visa 
to 
Yugoslavia.

Q: What kind of contact di
d you have with  your fa
ther while you were in 
Paris
? 
A: None that I remember. None whatsoever. 
Q: What did you think of 
Paris
? 
A: Oh, I loved 
Paris,
 I loved 
Paris.
 The first thing, of course
, I got the beautiful hat, 
that outfit in 
Paris
 that -- I loved going to the 
Louvre
, I loved going to the opera, I 
loved going to the markets,
 the -- when we left 
Paris
, we both -- we came to 
Yugoslavia
 with two birds, with a bi
g birdcage that we had.  
Q: So birds that you had 
had in your apartment? 

A: No, we bought them, I think,
 just shortly before we left. 
Q: So now you are going 
to join your father? 
A: Correct. 

Q: How did you feel about leaving 
F-France
? You had already left
 Vienna
, this is 
the second leave-taking. Did that bother you? 

A: I don™t think so. I was just read y for 
a new adventure, a new scene. I -- I don™t 
even remember being very excited about s eeing my father. All I remember vividly is 
when  the ch auffeur picked us up in 
Yugoslavia
 in this little village, my mother said 
that she wasn™t going straight to wh ere we 
were living, but she wa
nted to see all the 
sights. And that poor man didn't know wh ere 
to took u -- take us, so he took us to 
some little forest that was nothi
ng, just a couple of trees, and those were the sights of 
the little village. But we then, before we 
had a house, we lived in the vineyards. 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg 
July 29, 2000 

 

 
 
25
Q: But what -- what was 
the train ride like from 
Paris
 to
 Yugoslavia
, was there any 
difficulty? 
A: None whatsoever, because I don™t re
member it, and I don™t reme mb er being 
frightened at all. All I 
remember is taking care of those silly birds.  
Q: So th en you arrived in
 Yugoslavia
. 
A: Correct. We lived for a short time in the 
vineyards, and it was great because in the 
winter -- so it probably was early fall when we
 got there -- in the winter it snowed so 
hard that we couldn™t go to  school, and th 
-- my sister and I used  to ski on the slopes, 
and have a good time. And then  after that 
my  father either bought or rented a huge 
house in the village itself, where we lived. 
Q: What was the name of the village? 
A: 
Slavonski Brod.
 
Q: And what did you do? 

A: I went to school there and I went to  Jewish religion there also. And we -- my 
father had several friends -- a lot of White 
Russians were  there, ar
istocracy that lived 
there. I don™t know why, maybe they were 
connected with my  father™s factory or not, 
I don™t recollect that. 

Q: Now this factory was this enamel factory? 
A: No, no. In 
Yugoslavia
 it was a factory that manufactured railroads. And my father 
was successful in selling it 
to the government of 
Yugoslavia
 and for that we all 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg 
July 29, 2000 

 

 
 
26
received Yugoslav citizenship. And I lear
ned Serbo-Croatian ve
ry quickly and my 
sister and I made it a p o int to only speak th at, because my mother and my father were 
quite slower.  
Q: At -- at what point had your father
 sold the company to the government? 
A: Okay, he sold it -- he was 
a very clever man in retros
pect, even though I hated him 
as a child. He sold it shortly before 
Hitler
 occupied
 Yugoslavia
. So it was to great 
advantage of the conglomerate. And th e cong
lomerate really had in mind to bring my  
father to the 
United States
 and have him take over a hu
ge factory here, which never 
materialized because 
my mother didn™t want to leav
e, which was pointless, because 
my  poor grandmother died anyway after be
ing taken fo r interrogations and all kinds 
of things. And she died at home,
 but she died very  unhappily . 
Q: You are in this village, and you said yo
u learned the language
. Did you have a lot 
of freedom? Were you out on th
e street with other children? 
A: No, we were never out on the street w
ith other children, but I had more freedom. 
It was a little bit less st
ructured than my life in 
Vienna
. And since the teacher that I 
had in 
Yugoslavia
, her husband wo rked  in the factory of my  father™s, I got a glowing 
report how good I was, which 
my father knew wasn™t so 
because I -- I always acted 
up in  school. 

Q: What -- were the non-Jewi
sh children friendly to you? 
A: They mu st have been, yes, yes. We ha
d -- we had a good time, we used to go 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg

swimming in the river that separated the tw
o villages. There was an identical village 
which was called 
Bostian Brod
, and it was like entering anot
her world. And that was 
like the 
minarets, 
and the woman in 
Wales
, and it was just the bridge that separated 
it, but it was like two totally separate worlds. 
Q: It was a mu -- Muslim city? 

A: Yes, it was mostly Muslim. Flies, 
men sitting and drinking co ffee, women 
working in the fiel
d. Very Muslim. 
Minarets
. 
Q: Were you still celeb rating Christmas? 

A: I don™t remember. I don™t remember. 

Q: So you lived as Jews? 
A: We lived as -- as Jews
, yes, definitely. Before
 Hitler
 came we -- we went to the 
capital of 
Croatia
, which was 
Zagreb. 
My father and mother to ok an apartment, and 
my sister and I were pu
t into a boarding school. 
Q: This was your parents™ decision? 

A: Was my parents foresight, because
 Hitler
 was already close to the border of
 
Yugoslavia
 and my  father was the only one who knew that 
Yugoslavia
 would very 
quickly fall into the ha
nds of the Germans. 
Q: N-Now that things were changing, were
 your parents -- and you were a little bit 
older, were your parents just telling you mo re about the situation? 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg 
July 29, 2000 

 

 
 
28
A: Never. My parents never discussed the s
ituation, this was what -- what was done. 
But we knew. I mean, I used to -- 
Q: How did you know? 
A: Because I still remember a conversation. See, my fath er™s friends, these -- th is one 
couple who was ar-aristocratic, because I 
remember the woman had a maid wash her 
feet, which impressed me very much at th
e time. And she never in her life had even 
washed her own feet. And they were all s
ittin g around and they 
were saying oh, the 
Yugoslav army  is going to defeat the Ge
rman army , and we are very strong and we 
are very powerful and nothing is ever going to happen to 
Yugoslavia
. I remember 
my father saying this is ridiculous and 
they ™re going to invade, and they™ll conquer 
Yugoslavia
 like every other country in a few days. So I -- I remember that, and I 
reme mb er listening to th at, and being fri
ghtening and really 
wanting to go to 
America
. I -- i-it -- in my mind at
 that time that was the only salvation fo r us, and the 
only salvation to  remain alive was 
America
.  
Q: Ho-H ow did you know that 
America
 was the salvation? Wh at did you know 
about 
America
 at that young age? 
A: Not mu ch , obviously, but 
that -- that -- that was alwa
y s in  my  mi n d .  I rememb er 
being devastated in a sense that my father 
didn™t take that position. So I mu st have 

been frightened. 

Q: And again, did you s -- talk
 it over with your sister? 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg 
July 29, 2000 

 

 
 
29
A: No, no. 
Q: What was the board ing school lik
e? What kind of school was it? 
A: I hated it, absolutely hate. I hated the di
scipline. We had to mar -- of -- we has to 
wash with cold water, which 
to me was a nightmare. My si
ster bribed the maid, but 
then I didn't wash ma -- to give me and he
r so me -- my sister was very inventive -- to 
give us hot water, which we 
had for a little while until I di
dn't wash my neck properly 
and the people in charge saw that the wate
r was hot, and we were both punished. And 
we had to  go on endless walks in the wint
er, and we had to wear brown stockings, 
which I hated and refused to
 wear, and I got million of
 demerits. If we had 15 
demerits we couldn™t go to  visit the pa
rents on th e week ends. Every week I had 
maybe 40 or 50 demerits. Also, I hated the 
food. We were supposed to eat all the 
food that was presented to us, and they ha
d blood sausage and polenta, and those two 
things I hated with a passion and I wouldn't
 eat them, and I got demerits. My sister 
never got a demerit. I don™t 
know whether she ate it or 
spit it out or -- or what she 
did, but she was the good one, so sh
e always could visit my  parents.  
Q: So there were times when sh
e would visit a
nd you could not? 
A: That™s correct, I had to stay there. Bu
t I still -- I was very, very stubborn child. I 
would not wear those brown stockings. I pretended to  be sick not to go on the walks. 

I -- I really did not like being in  
that -- in that board ing school. 
Q: Was it a re -- was it a religiously oriented school? 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg 
July 29, 2000 

 

 
 
30
A: Not at all, no. Just a board ing school. 
Q: So you lived as j -- they knew you were Jews -- 

A: Yes. 
Q: -- and you lived  as Jews? 
A: Yes, that was my father™s purpose
. They  were hiding us because when 
Germany
 
invaded 
Za greb
 they had the -- I think they had to 
give over some of the quarters to 
German officers, and they were hiding us, 
they were hiding the fact that we were 
Jewish children. 

Q: Did you sense any anti-Semitism on the pa
rt of any of the teachers or students? 
A: No, not that I recollect at
 all, no. Actually I liked we
aring the uniforms. I lik ed the 
uniforms, they were pretty. At least, I t
hought they were pretty. And what I really 
liked is that my sister had to wear the sa
me thing th at I had to wear. That was a big 
plus in my life at the time. 

Q: And how long were
 you at the school? 
A: I guess several months. My father was a
rrested during that time. He was arrested 
by th e uth -- by the Croatians, which were th
en in control, and they were like the 
Nazis, they -- the concentration camps in 
Yugoslavia
 were much more horrible, even 
than the ones in 
Germany
. And he -- he then pretended 
not to be Yu goslav. He was 
very, very  smart man -- and that he was a Ge
rman and that they ha
d not right to arrest 
him, and somehow he got out. 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg 
July 29, 2000 

 

 
 
31
Q: Did he have false papers? 
A: Well, he -- he never lost his Austrian 
citizenship, we were just given a second 
citizenship as -- as a big honor. And I -- I th
ink th at was the story, I™m not a hundred  
percent sure, but he got out of it. And then  
he got us out of the boarding school and 
the four of us went to th e coast of 
Yugoslavia
, which was occupied  by 
Italy
, and we 
lived there what they called 
in liberal confino
, wh ich means you are free, but you 
are not allowed to leave the pr
emise -- the -- the -- the locality. 
Q: Were -- I take it you were not upset ab
out leaving the school, obviously. Were you 
upset about leaving the area? 

A: No, not at all. I loved 
it where we went, because we lived in a villa, and it -- I 
think that™s where my father
 sold my  sister™s stamp collection and we had some 
money because of that. 

Q: This is a villa on the coast? 

A: Yes, we were on th e coast of 
Yugoslavia
, we were quite high 
up. It was called 
Sekwenitsa
. It was near the -- near 
Fiume,
 what used  to be 
Fiume
, and we went 
swimming the whole time and I remember my
 father gave me lesso ns in German 
composition and I had to write
 compositions for him, whic
h I hated, but I had to do 
it. And I -- the first time that I had a frie
ndship with a boy, who was my  age that time 
and I guess I had maybe a crush on him, only 
I didn™t know it. And we used to play 

endlessly in the water, go swimming. And my
 great uncle lived also there, he came 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg 
July 29, 2000 

 

 
 
32
down  there with his daughter-in-law, wh
o was a physician, who supposed ly later 
poisoned him, which I don™t know. And -- 
Q: This is
 Gustav Fall
? 
A: This is 
Gustav Fall.
 And I rememb er visiting him and en joying him. He told me 
that -- I never forgot, he to -- I used to 
tell him that I was bored and he told me, 
intelligent people never get bored. And I liked 
him a lot, we used to go visit him, my 
friend and I. The -- th-the -- the young boy. 
Q: What else did you do,
 did you go to school? 
A: No, we didn™t go to school, but I was elect
ed, I had to go with my
 father up to the 
mountains or something th at we could wa
lk up and trade -- I don™t know wh at he 
traded to get some eggs and get food su pp
lies for us. Food was scarce, but we had 
potatoes, we had enough fo od, but let™s sa
y an egg was a luxury. And -- but -- and I 
hated going with him, but I was elected to do that. 
Q: Did you feel that your life was in danger in any way there? 
A: Not at all. Not at all there. I felt very s
ecure there. I didn™t think we were in danger 
there at the time. 
Q: And you -- what did you hear ab out a man named
 Tito
? 
A: Noth ing at that time, nothing. We heard 
later, when we were in the concentration 

camp, we -- when we were liberated, that 
was the first time that we heard about 
Tito
 
and the partisans.

Q: And so th en how long we
re you staying in this house in the mountains? 
A: Not in the mountains,
 we were on the coast. 
Q: Oh, on the coast. 
A: How long did we stay there? Several 
months. It was summertime, because we all 
went swimming a lot. And then
 sudden ly one -- one day, we
 were just picked up, put 
in a truck and deported . 
Q: And where were you taken? 
A: Then we were taken to the concentration camp. 
Q: And where was this? 

A: That was on an island in the -- 
Q: In the
 Adria tic
? 
A: In the 
Adria tic
. 
Q: Which island was it? 

A: 
Rab. 
Q: And what was your reaction when 
you had to just leave sudden ly? 
A: Was a mixture. I -- I don™t think I was to
o frighten ed . I tol -- I always told my self, 
this is an adventure. And I ha
d no clue where we were goin
g, so I played a game that 
this was an adventure and I 
had no idea where I was going
 and I was interested where 
I was going to end up. Of course where I ende
d up I wasn™t too, too thrilled, because 
my father was separated from my mother at  the time, an d he was in a barracks with

men and we were in a barracks with my
 mother and all the women and all the 
children. Bu t later on, we had our own unit. 
Q: Later on your father
 moved back with you? 
A: I think so , yes, yes. 

Q: Did you go -- you said you were fright
ened , did you question your mo ther, then? 
A: About what? 

Q: Well, about what 
was happening and why. 
A: I knew what was happening. 

Q: And why? 

A: And I knew why it was happening. I kno
w I was I Jewish and I knew that -- that 
that was the fright -- that we were depo
rted. I knew about the fascists, and I knew 
about the camps.  

Q: Were you angry th at you were Jewish? 

A: Yes, for a -- I wasn™t angry. I wished th
at -- well, I was blonde and blue eyed, so I 
couldn™t wish for that. But I did 
wish that I could -- even in 
Vienna
 I remember I 
wanted to be part of the Nazi children, or
 something like that, just in order to blend 
in. But it -- it wasn™t really a 
-- a si -- a thing that I desired tremendously. It was more 
like thinking it wouldn™t be bad if I could be that. 

Q: Wha -- what was the livin
g conditions when you got to
 Ra b
? 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg 
July 29, 2000 

 

 
 
35
A: They were pretty bad, I remember. 
The food was very scarce. When we moved 
into -- at first we were separated, whic
h was, I guess, frighten ing. I do rememb er 
sneaking to visit my  father and him being 
extremely angry that I did that, because it 
seems to me -- later on I understood th at 
some of the me n were sneaking wo men in 
there, their own wives, just to be close to
 them, and my father was very strict and 
didn™t want me exposed to any of that, so -- 
Q: Why -- why did you -- if you weren't cl
ose to your father, 
why did you go visit 
him? 

A: I don™t know. I don™t know, maybe partia
lly curiosity to see 
what he was li -- 
where he was staying and what his barra
ck was like, and it -- whether it was any 
different from mine. But that was one episod
e that I recollect. I 
also then recollect 
going in to an own -- little house or barrack or
 something, where th
efamily as a unit 
stayed. I remember both my mother and fath
er had to work. They had to do manual 
labor. And I recollect that the -- the peop
le in the camp organized some kind of a 
school where my  sister and I attended.

Beginning Tape Two, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of the 
United Sta tes 
Holocaust Memorial Museum 
volunteer collection interview with
 Dorrit Ostberg
. This is tape numb er two, side
 A,
 
and we were talking ab
out your experience on 
Rab 
Island. And you sa
id your parents 
went to work? 
A: Yeah, definitely my parents -- 

Q: What kind of wo rk did they  do? 
A: Manual work . Probably my  mo ther had to wo rk in  a kitchen. I don™t -- I don™t 
recollect what my fa
ther had to do.  

Q: Was that difficult for your mother, wh
o had led a comp letely different life? 
A: My mother was a very, very unusual, 
remarkable woman. She made the best of 
every situation where she was. And 
even later on, when we were in 
Fort Ontario
, 
she -- she loved to work, sh
e volunteered to work , an
d sh-she -- she was very 
remarkable that way. 
Q: What kind of wo rk 
did your father do? 
A: I don™t know. Don™t recollect. I™m sure 
he hated it and found it very demeaning. 
That was very much 
in his character. 
Q: And what did you 
do during the day? 
A: We went to school, we were s -- and th
en  I f -- I met my  friend, a girl, and I -- I 
formed my first really close 
friendship wi-with another girl. 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg 
July 29, 2000 

 

 
 
37
Q: What was her name? 
A: 
Leah. 
Q: And what did 
you do with her? 
A: Well, we -- she probably attended the school
, but where I really got close to her is 
because we both were put in an army hos
pital, because we were both -- she had a 
heart condition and I must have had hepatitis
. And we were put in an army hospital 
together where we -- where they kept
 us for a very long ha -- time. 
Q: How was your asthma
 during all of this? 
A: Strangely enough, better. And strangely 
enough, probably because of the terrain, 
which was mostly like a desert, the 
island was not full of vegetation. 
Q: And how long did 
you stay there? 
A: As I recollect, at least four months. A
nd we got better food th ere. And we -- there 
was a little Italian orderly who called us sister
s, and told us Italia
n and was very, very 
nice to us and ev en th e doctors were very nice. 
Q: And what was the living arrangement? Y
ou said your father 
joined -- came back 
and joined you. Were there ot
her families in the barracks? 

A: You mean in the -- in the camp itself? 
Q: Yeah, mm-hm. 
A: Yeah, I think the families 
then had like little units within
 barracks, or little huts or 
something like that. 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg 
July 29, 2000 

 

 
 
38
Q: Did you have any privacy? 
A: As a family, I guess. I guess. I don™t 
know because I was hardly there because 

very shortly wh en we got ther
e, I was put in the hospital. 
Q: So were you in the hospita
l for most of the time there? 
A: Most of the time. 

Q: And what was your state of mi nd? 

A: I was very happy in the hospital. I kno
w, sounds weird. I don™t ever remember 
missing my sister or my mother. Well, at 
the time I was angry at my sister anyway, 
because the last couple of weeks that we were in -- before we were put in a 
concen tration camp, she kind of stole my  
friend, and he was very, very impressed 
that an older girl was interested in him a
nd he totally started ignoring me and I was 
not only jealous, but angry, hur
t, and really wanted to ha
ve nothing to 
do with my 
sister.  

Q: Did your parents talk ab
out the future with you? 
A: Never. Never discussed the future, neve
r discussed the present. I don™t recall a 
single conversation. 

Q: Did you talk about yo
ur gran dmother at all? 
A: Yes. My mother was very sad. I re
member that we were notified that my 
grandmother died and I reme mb er my  mo ther
 being ex tremely s -- she was very close 
to her mother. 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg 
July 29, 2000 

 

 
 
39
Q: And -- and how did you feel when
 you heard your 
grandmother died? 
A: Very sad, because I lo -- 
I liked her a lot. She taught 
me how to play cards, she 
told me -- she told me storie
s, she read to me a lot. Sh
e -- I -- I liked her a lot. And 
then the summers I was mainly 
in her care, plus the governess, because my  sister and 
my cousin took off, never want
ed any part of me, except to
 -- to tease me and torture 
me. And my  grandmother used to walk -- wa
lk with me. We had a dog at the time, I 
reme mb er having to  count all the dogs with her and th ings like that. 
Q: What kind of clothes 
were you wearing now? 
A: Strangely, I don™t remember. In  th
e camp, you mean? I don™t remember. I 
reme mb er being very  well dressed, or I th
ought I was well dressed when  we were be 

-- before we got to camp. Camp i -- well, 
m-mainly I don™t recollect I think because 
in the hospital I had hospital clothes on. That™s all I wore. 
Q: Were you bedridden in the hospital? 

A: A -- a length -- a great length of time becau
se as I said, I proba -- I -- I know I had 
yellow jaundice, I probably 
had hepatitis, I may also have
 had bronchitis and asthma, 
I don™t know. But I -- I was quite sick, ot
herw ise they would have never had the 
permission to put me there. 
Q: And had your eating habits
 changed as you got older? 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg 
July 29, 2000 

 

 
 
40
A: Not really. Not really, I -- I don™t rememb er
 having bad food in  the hospital at all. 
I -- I don™t reme mb er being hungry at all in th
e hospital, that came
 mu ch later, I was 
very hungry.  
Q: And then -- so you were -- you 
were in this camp for how long? 
A: I don™t recollect how long. I think 
it was over a year. It was up to when 
Italy
 
capitulated. 
Q: Were there many other children your age there? 
A: There must have been, be
cause they organized a school, so there mu st have been. 
That was really the only real education that I got after
 Yugoslavia
, after the public 
school in 
Yugoslavia. 
So I really, as far as schooling 
is concerned have -- had a very 
sketchy schooling background. 
And later on actually, the -- the lesso ns that my father 
gave me in composition, in writing Germ
an, in reading Germ
an was probably a 
blessing, even though I ha
ted every minute of it.  
Q: What did -- what k -- how was 
the school set up in this camp? 
A: Well, just probably another hut where -- 
where we all sat together and got some -- 
mu st have gotten so me kind of instructions
 from some -- some of the Jewish people 
that -- that were very well versed in hist
ory and languag es and -- and mathematics or 
whatever. 
Q: Were -- were the people in the camp all Jewish? 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg 
July 29, 2000 

 

 
 
41
A: No, but a great number of them were 
Jewish, and a great number of them were 
politically against the Yugoslav regime. 
Q: So the -- 
A: But I think we were separated. I -- I s
ee -- at least I seem to
 recollect that the 
people we were with were all Jewish. 
Q: Did they celebrate any holidays? Di
d you do anything in a Jewish sense? 
A: I was sitting in the hospital. We were 
not doing anything in th -- in a sense of 
holid ays. 

Q: So were you in the hospital 
for a good part of that year? 
A: Yes, for a good part of that year, 
at least four or five or six months. 
Q: And did your folk s co
me to visit you often? 
A: Never. They couldn™t visit. They couldn™t get out of the concentration camp . 

Q: Oh, th e hospital was not
 in the camp, it was -- 
A: Not at all, it was like miles away. Th
e -- the -- the camp only had infir-infirmary, 
where my father was for some length of tim
e. He was also ill. He had eczema and all 

kinds of complications. But the hospital its
elf was a veterans kind of hospital, a 

military hospital on the island, away from the camp. 
Q: I see. So you did not see your family for months. 
A: For months. 

Q: What -- what is 
that like for a child? 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg 
July 29, 2000 

 

 
 
42
A: I don™t know. Never missed it,
 not that I recollect. Maybe -- 
Q: Could they -- could they write to you? 
A: Maybe. Maybe there was correspondence. 
I don™t recollect it. Probably not, it was 
a concentration camp. 

Q: And do you remember ge
tting out of the hospital? 
A: Yes, I remember returning,
 but very shortly after that
 the armi -- 
the armistice 
came. 
Q: And what happened? 
A: Suddenly all of the Italian army disa
ppeared and we were free. And I remember 

not having shoes and ru
nning out of the camp  just for 
the drama of being outside and 
no lo nger inside. And then we had two choice
s. The first choice was to return to the 
coast of 
Yugoslavia
, whi -- which was still pa
rtially occupied by 
Germany
. And 
many of the young men, including the boy
friend that my sister had at the time 

returned to fight, to join 
the -- the partisan and to fi
ght against the Germans and 
against the 
[indecipherable]
. Many of the people chose to 
return anyway, even those 
that couldn™t fight and my  father organize
d a very, very  small 
group of people and we 
hopped from island to island renting small fi
sher boats, and -- with very little money 
and no fo od at all. 

Q: Did you know why he 
decided to do this rath
er than st-staying in 
Yugoslavia
? 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg 
July 29, 2000 

 

 
 
43
A: Yes, yes, I did know. I know th at he 
wanted to reach the island that was sco -- 
occupied by the allies, 
which we finally did. 
Q: So you went, you said, 
from -- you -- you were in 
these little fishing boats? 
A: Little fishing boats. 
Q: What was that like? 

A: Oh, I loved that. I loved it. It™s very 
adventurous. It™s very rough. I remember 
everybody getting seasick but me, because I 
stood outside. I -- I c
ould never be down  
in the cabin because I would ge
t very seasick. But outside in
 the -- I love the ocean, I 
always liked the ocean. And I remember cl
imbing with my frie
nd all the mountains 
[indecipherable]
 that were there. I remember there were no -- no -- no facilities to go 
to the toilet. 

Q: On these different islands? 

A: On the different islands, we made in th
e fields with the goats around. I remember 
being starved to death and swearing to  God th
at never in my  life will I be picky again 
about eating, wh ich I mu st say I did not 
adhere to. Being so hungry that I never 
thought of anything else but
 food. Being hungry to  that degree. Eating the fruit of 
some trees which looked like a banana but
 it™s dried. It™s very sweet, but it™s 
extremely constipating, I don™t know, 
and having problems with that. And -- 
Q: But your health rema
ined okay on these different -- on th is boat trip? 
A: I guess so. I guess so. 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg 
July 29, 2000 

 

 
 
44
Q: What about your parents,
 how are they ma naging?  
A: They were managing. My mother was wo
nderful, my father -- we had to sleep 
sometimes in -- in a room 
and we would relieve ours
elves in a bucket, and I 
remember once my father 
spilling the bucket because the men had to bring the 
buckets down. And I remember that that 
was the funniest thing I ever saw, and 
laughing and my  father giving me a good 
slap and he was furious with me, but I™m 

still laughing ab out it, which is not 
[indecipherable]
. Bu t they always managed, we -
- it was very -- actually it was an extr
emely dangerous expedition. The -- 
Q: Did you know how dangerous 
it was while you were doing it? 
A: Yes, definitely yes. We knew that af
ter we left the island,
 one hour later the 
Germans were there. We -- 

Q: So you hopped from one island to -- 

A: -- we hopped -- that™s the right expressi
on, we hopped from one island to the next. 
Q: And who took you? Who was 
the captain of these boats? 
A: Fishermen. Small fishermen that somehow
 my  father had -- I don™t know what he 

bribed  them with, I don™t know where th
e money came from, whether it was a ring 
that he was hiding and he had, I don™t kn
ow how they  did it, but the -- it was more 
than just us. It was probably a group of 
20 or 30, maybe even 40, I™m not sure. 
Q: Now it -- but you said your father was th
e organizer and th e leader of this group? 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg 
July 29, 2000 

 

 
 
45
A: Part of the -- part of the organizer, th
e me n were. The men got togeth er and did it, 
and we just followed, th
e wo men and the ch ildren. 
Q: And by that time what possessi
ons were you bringing with you? 
A: Hardly  any. Hardly any.  
Q: And then you e-ended up where? 

A: We ended up on an island that finally br
ought us to -- to the 
i -- to the main island 
that was occupied by the allies.
 From that island they th -- 
Q: What was the name of 
that island, do you know? 
A: Yes, I did know. I think I -- I -- 

Q: Okay. And then from there -- 
A: It was way down, almost near 
Greece
. I did know it, but I can™t -- I can™t think of 
it right now. 

Q: And then from there? 

A: From there we were transported to the coast of 
Italy, 
and from there we were 
supposed to go to a camp in
 Africa
, a holding camp. And the -- it was called
 
Brindisi, 
the port. And again my father, I don™t 
know how, but he convinced some -- 
an Italian guy to  vouch for us and we got out of there. 
Q: How long were you in 
Brindisi
? 
A: Probably not ev
en  a day or so. 
Q: And where did you go? 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg 
July 29, 2000 

 

 
 
46
A: From there we went to 
Bari
 and I don™t even recollect how we got there. Probably 
by bus or by train or by so
mething like that. And I don™t have no -- I have no clue 
how my  father managed to get there. But we got to
 Bari,
 and I know that we were 
walking in the streets and we were picked
 up by tw o Italian wo men who brought us 
to their home, saw th at we got food rations
, organized us, got us
 in a -- put us up til 
we got an apartmen
t, and then -- 
Q: Wer -- were these women that 
your father had known about? 
A: No. We never knew them, 
the-they just literally saw us marching in the streets and 
picked us up. 
Q: The four of you? 
A: The four of us. And my mother for y
ears afterwards was sending th em packag es 
and gifts and -- until they died. They were
 older women, they were quite old. 
Q: So you -- you moved in with  them? 
A: We move -- first moved in with them, 
and then they got us
 some kind of an  
apartment. My father -- my 
mother went to work. She -- 
she and my sister , I thi nk, 
worked in a canteen, n 
-- in a ma -- in an allied cantee
n. And th-that™s when I told my 
mo ther, how could you ever ge
t a job? You don™t know wh
at to do and she to ld me, 
she -- you will see what I can do, and she slapped me. 

Q: And what did you 
and your sister do? 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg 
July 29, 2000 

 

 
 
47
A: My sister I think worked there too. I th
in k  sh e -- my  mo th er an d my  siste r  wo rk ed  
there to get a little bit of money. 
Q: And you? 
A: And I was just home, I guess, and my father. 
Q: Why is it your father didn™t work? 

A: I don™t think he co uld get a job. You know, they wanted wo men in the -- in there. 

I mean, we had no permit or anything like th
at. We -- we must have got -- my father 
mu st have gotten us probably a -- a provisio
nal visa or something. And very  shortly 

we a -- oh no, I went to school
, that™s where I went. And my 
sister , t oo. No, my sister  
didn™t wo rk. My sister and I went to a 
school, a convent scho
ol. This is where I 
learned all my  Italian. That™s wh ere we we
nt, we went to school. We went to co nven t 
school, we learned it -- Italian, we lear
ned Latin. That was the first four month 
schooling th at I got again. 

Q: And you went to school open ly, as Jews? 
A: Yes, definitely.  
Q: And you were still going by your name, 
Dorrit
? 
A: Yes, yes, we went openly . But th ey di
d -- I reme mb er they did, we did have to 
attend mass and we did because it was a c
onvent school. And -- and they did si -- I 

think they hoped to convert us. Actually, we
 had changed religion twice, just to get 
out, but we never -- to us it 
was just a piece of paper. 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg 
July 29, 2000 

 

 
 
48
Q: So you had papers? 
A: We had kind of papers that my  sist
er, much later in life retri-trieved from 
Yugoslavia
. I think we -- we changed religion 
twice, to -- to some kind of a 
Protestant religion, then  some kind of a Ca
tholic religion, just in order to get out. 
Q: But did you keep 
your same names? 
A: Yes, yes, yes. Nothing else. I do -- we -- we -- I -- I don™t even think th at we 

ourselves went to be converted. I thi
nk it was all done with falsified papers. 
Q: How was it sitting during a mass for you? 

A: Oh, I didn™t -- I didn™t mind at all. I -- it w as just learning it the lat -- and learning. 

I love the singing, th e singing is always beau
tiful. I love the church singing actually. I 
do. Just like I love the -- the -- to me the -- th e best thing about a 
Jewish ceremony is 
the cantor, and I -- I just -- I adore the singing.  

Q: And there was a camp on
 Bari
. Did you ever go over there, did you ever meet 
anybody at the camp, the refugee camp? 
A: I didn™t even know it ex
isted. We -- we had no -- 
Q: There are other refugees. 
A: We had no recollection of a camp  in 
Bari
. I don™t -- I™m not sure that my father 
even knew it existed. 

Q: And what were your living conditions wh en  you moved out of the women™s 

apartment? 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg 
July 29, 2000 

 

 
 
49
A: Pretty good. I mean, not bad, but we 
had enough fo od, we had pasta, we had -- I 
g u e ss my  mo th er co
oked. I don™t -- 
Q: Was this a bo -- was this a boarding school or a day school? 
A: That we went? Day school. Day school. 
Day school. And my  sister even had a 
very close friend that was Yugoslav that
 also -- I guess maybe he was on -- on a 
transport with us, or just arrived in 
Ba ri
, I don™t know. But I remember we had a 
pretty nice life for the few months, and th
en  we applied -- then we heard that 
President 
Roosev elt
 was taking 1,000 refugees to 
America
, and we applied for it, as 
a family. 
Q: How did your family hear about this? 
A: My father heard about it. I don™t know ho
w, but all I remember is praying that we 
would be accepted and being terri
fied because we had to have a physical exam, that 
something would be wrong in -- in -- in es
pecially me, y ou know, having been ill, 
that they wouldn™t accept us. But -- 

Q: Now we™re talking June ™44. 
A: Right. So -- and we were accepted, and 
I was as happy as -- as can  be, finally to 

come to 
America
. Was a big thing fo r me. 
Q: It sounds like your father was very tu
ned in to wh at was going on all the time. 
A: My father was a very, very astute bus in essman, and he was a very clever man, 

because he really saved us in all these positi
ons. But he -- he was -- he was very, very 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg

50
strict, very Germanic, not at all interest
ed in the things my mother and I were 
interested in. He had had very little training 
in -- even though he had a good voice as 
-- he used to sing, he used to
 like classical music. But litera
ture didn™t really interest 
him and many of the things that were very 
essential to my mother and I. I and all -- 
all throughout this I was reading, constan
tly reading. I don™t know how my  mo ther 
got me books, but I was reading in -- in
 -- in Serbo-Croatian, I was reading in 
German, I was later reading in Italian. I 
was an avid reader, I loved reading.  
Q: So you appli -- did you yo
urself as a child have to 
fill out any forms for this 
United States
 journey? 
A: I don™t -- 
Q: Or was it just your parents? 
A: I think just my parents. I -- I d
on™t think I had to fill out anything.  
Q: And did you go thro ugh a medical check-up? 

A: Yes, I did. 
Q: So you™re in 
Bari
 and then you get accepted. 
A: Right. 
Q: And how mu ch longer did you stay in 
Bari
 after that? 
A: Several months, not much longer. 
Q: For several months, yeah. You left 
Bari
 to go to where? 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg 
July 29, 2000 

 

 
 
51
A: I think we were transpond -- transported in
 -- in -- in trucks to a holding camp in 
Aversa
, 
Italy.
 I still recollect lice going over us in
 that camp. We stayed, I think, 
only overnight 
Q: Did you know anybody el
se at that point who was 
accepted for th is journey? 
A: No. 
Q: You were -- so as far as you knew from 
Bari
, you were the only people you knew 
in 
Bari
 who were accepted? 
A: No, we didn™t know anyone 
[indeciphera ble]
 
Q: You were the only. 

A: The only ones that we know -- knew of. 
Q: Knew  of. 
A: Right. No , none of our friends
 or anybody that we knew of. 
Q: Were people jealous back in 
Ba ri
? 
A: We didn't have that many 
friends for people to be j
ealous. I think that one friend 
of my  sisters had plan ned to go back to 
Yugoslavia
 anyway. He was older, he 
wanted to  fight or do so mething. And I 
don™t -- and I had lost my -- my friend 
Leah
 
that had went to 
Africa
, which I never heard from her agai
n. So I had just -- I didn™t 
form any friendships with any of the child
ren in the convent school. So we had no 

friends there that we would say goodbye, ex
cept for the two women that were so kind 

to us. But they were older 
women there, they were not 
really part of my life.

Q: Just as a side, when you were in th
e convent school, were there other Jewish 
children, or were you the only two? 
A: I don™t know. I don™t know. 
Probably not, at that time. 
Q: Yeah. Okay, back 
to where you were, a little farthe
r forward. And so you stayed 
overn ight, and then ? 

A: Then I think we were -- we were trans
ported by train to -- to where the boat left. 

Q: And was it confusion, con -- or cont
rolled, or -- what was it like for you? 
A: Very controlled, very controlled, 
but they -- we already started -- in 
Aversa
 
already I -- I met several people my age, an
d several boys my  age. One of them I 
loathed of course. And -- and I met 
Corky
 who was -- seemed very impressive to me. 
That is the -- the man that married  my 
best friend. And he talked, of course, 
exclusively with my sister, but I remember
 being -- not going to  sleep on purpose all 
during th at -- that long trip to where the boa
t was, just in order to impress him how I 
could stay up. But th
at was about all. 
Q: Now you are almost 15 years old? 

A: Not quite. I would say about 14. 

Q: Yeah, it was the summer before you were 15. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: And you were very excited 
obviously, about 
going to the 
United States
. 
A: Extremely excited, extremel
y excited and happy about going.

Q: How did you all feel and you
r family feel about President
 Roosevelt? 
A: I guess very positively. Very positive. He 
-- because he was our savior at the time. 
Q: And then you get to the boat. 
A: We got to the boat, we go
t on the boat and of course
 the food was fabulous there, 
for the first night. 
Q: What -- what did the boat look like to you, the 
Henry Gibbons 
boat? 

A: No sp ecific impressions. I -- I wasn™t even
 aware at the time that it was part of a 
convoy. I was not aware, unlike my  friend 
[indeciphera ble]
 my friend 
Elfie 
says she 
was very much aware when 
the Germans attacked it or -- or -- or so -- I was not 
aware of that. I don™t recollect it at all. I 
was just concen trating on making friends 
with -- with -- with my  age group, not my  
sister™s age group. And my  sister then 
found friends in her age group. And I just 
liked being on the boa
t. It was exciting. 
Q: Were you aware that some of the other people from 
Euro pe 
were in very poor 
condition, malnourished and not enough clothes. 

A: I guess we were all in the same condition.
 We all didn™t look terrific. I don™t think 
I was aware that I looked particularly ba
d or particularly good. And strangely 

enough, I don™t remember -- I guess we ha
d almo st nothing to  wear, so I wasn™t 
really conscious of -- of wh at I was wearing,
 because I recollect the things I wore in 

Paris
 and things that I wore in
 Vienna
 and then a lot of my  clothes at that time, and 
definitely the brown stockings and the -- an
d the -- and the other -- in the school, but 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg 
July 29, 2000 

 

 
 
54
I don™t recollect my attire at all at that
 time. I guess I looked like everybody else, 
pretty -- pretty bad. 
Q: Did you know th at there were wou
nded American soldiers on board also? 
A: N -- I wasn™t aware of it. I also never saw 
Ruth Gruber
 on th e boat. Never did. 
At least, I wasn™t aware of seeing her. 

Q: What were th-the sleeping c
onditions for you and your family? 
A: Probably just bunks. Probably nothing ex
ceptional except that there were no lice 
to -- to -- to -- to crawl on us. 
I™m sure they weren 't really 
plush, but I wasn™t used to 
that anyway, so I don™t re
me mb er being pleased or displeased about it. The only 
thing I do rememb er is being as mu ch on th
e deck as possible, because I did -- the 
roll of the boat makes me seasick. 
Q: What kind of activities did y
ou take part in on the boat? 
A: They had very few activities, n o t that I 
recollect at all. Just
 really talking to 
people, sitting on the d
eck and that™s all I remember. And eating well. 
Q: We -- did you speak with the othe
r young people your age about your 

experiences? 

A: Never about the experiences. 
Q: Why not? 
A: I don™t know. Maybe -- not experiences.
 Geographically we did speak wh ere we 
came from, which other camps. Some
 of my friends -- my friend
 Jeanette
 for 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg

55
instance, was sitting in a convent, and a lo
t of the others came from another camp  on 
another island, 
Verramonte
, I think it was called. And we
 did sp eak about where we 
came from, just in order to 
kind of identify ourselves. Never about the past, and at 
that time we spoke, I s -- I was exclus
ively with the Yugoslav group and I 
exclusively spoke Serbo-Croatian
 
rather than the German
. And our international 
language in the camp was really Italian, because my  friend 
Jeanette 
was fr-fro m 
Paris
 and French and she -- I did -- I spoke ve
ry little French, even  th ough I had been  
-- lived in 
Paris
. So  we spoke Italian. So that was kind of our common language, 
either Italian or Serbo-Croatian.

Q: This is a continuation of the 
United Sta tes 
Holocaust Memorial Museum 
volunteer collection interview with 
Dorrit Ostberg.
 This is tape numb er two, side
 B.
 
Were there other -- did you notice any of
 the other young people had been  from 
Vienna
? Did you find anybody on -- 
A: The only other person that was from 
Vienna
 was 
Elfie
, sh -- that I knew, that was 
in our in -- intermediate ci
rcle. She came from a very, very
 different background th an 
I did, in the sense that her parents were
 quite religious and 
sh e came fro m a mu c h  
lower middle class background than I did.
 And at the time, of course, I wanted 
nothing to do with her. We became friends 
much, much later at one of the reunions. 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg 
July 29, 2000 

 

 
 
56
She was -- to me she was th
e most beautiful little thing 
ever. She was much younger, 
so I figured she was very stupid. And the 
boy that I liked, liked
 her a lot and that 
made her of course, not very friendly, you 
know, very happy. So I had very little to 
do with her. But my main friend was 
Jeanette
 and then  I had my  o-other main friend 
was
 Paul
. We were -- we -- we saw each other da
ily and we -- we went as groups and 
we did ev erything in  groups. 
Q: Did you have contact with any 
of the staff peop
le on the ship? 
A: No. 

Q: American sailor, you know -- 

A: None. 
Q: -- navy personnel. 
A: None whatsoeve
r. None whatsoever. 
Q: What was the lack of pr
ivacy in living quar -- in liv
ing quarters like for you? 
A: I guess none, because I -- I guess this is 
what I was used to, so I don™t remember 
being pro -- that it was a problem 
to me, let™s put it that way. 
Q: It was such a tremendous chan ge in your life, after leaving
 Vienna
 where you had 
so much space, then to be in
 such small quarters with your
 family. Was that hard for 
you to ad just to? For the first eight and 
a half years of your life it was a different 
situation, of course. 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg 
July 29, 2000 

 

 
 
57
A: Yes and no. You have to understand that
 as children, even though we had maybe 
14 rooms, they were not our rooms. 
You know, like when 
I observe my little 
granddaughter, she runs through the hous
e, it™s her house, it™s her car, it™s her 
everything. She™s only three.
 It™s definitely her car, he
r house, her everything. We 
never had th at sense. We -- our life was our room, my  sister™s and my  room wh ere 
the governess stayed with us. We were th en escorted to the 
-- to the music room 
where we played the piano. We then went 
to the dining room to eat. We n -- we 
hardly ever entered my moth
er™s and father™s 
bedroom. And the -- the big salon, we 
were only there to be presented to the -- to
 -- to -- to people when they came. The 
servants™ quarters we were never allowed to
. The kitchen certainly
 we were never in. 
The bathrooms we were in, but we-we -- in 
that sense, we didn™t lose the space. 
Q: Mm. When you were on the
 Henry Gibbons
, on the trip to the 
United States
, 
were there any times when you remember 
where there were alarm bells, or you had 
to put on lifejackets? 
A: Yes, I think so. I think we had alarm 
bells and we had life jackets, but I don™t 
remember them as being frightened or that 
I -- that -- that it bothered me or anything 
like that. I™m sure th
ey -- they had that. 
Q: Is there anything else you wanted 
to talk about the 
-- the boat ride? 
[tape break] 
On th e ship there was -- there were some rabbis. Were you aw are of that? Were there 
any religious services? 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg 
July 29, 2000 

 

 
 
58
A: There probably were, they probably  br
ought us -- I don™t kn
ow, don™t rememb er. 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: If there were, they weren™t that significant to me. 
Q: Uh-huh. And then  you arrive in the 
United States
. What was your first view of 
the 
United States
? 
A: I guess the Statue of Liberty and ge-g etting into 
New York
 harbor was very, very 
exciting, and seeing my  cousin who -- 
who c -- who came on the -- board. And -- 
Q: Did -- did people cheer as the boat wa
s coming in, do you rememb er? Were you 
all lining the railings? 
A: Yes, I do remember that. We were all on 
deck and we were all very, very excited. 
And he really was my cousin. He was -- he 
was the son of my father™s s -- first or 
second co usin that had the same house wh er
e we used to spend our summers, and he 
used to come and visit. And my  cousin  
Susie
 had a tremendous crush on him. At the 
time I met him, he was married to the daug
hter of a very, very close friend of my  
mo ther™s. And I reme mb er her vividly becau
se she was a beautiful, beautiful woman 
and I remember her in the evening gown th
at was totally fru -- 
her back was totally 
exposed, and she was so elegant. I reme mb
er her at functions from my  house and I 
was very impressed with the mother. The 
daughter I had very little contact with at 
that time. S h e later became a very close fri
end of mine, because she was much older. 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg 
July 29, 2000 

 

 
 
59
She was like, at least three years older than
 my cousin even. So 
that was f -- three, 
five -- about eight or 10 years older than me. 
Q: When you got off the boat
 and you put your foot on American land, is -- was that 
a mo mentous thing for you, or di
d you just went off the boat? 
A: We just went off the boat. I think 
the -- the -- just the 
idea that I was in
 America
 
was fabulous, but I don™t rememb er, you know
, I™m touching American soil as being 
something significant to
 me at the time. 
Q: And your parents reaction, do
 you -- did they do anything?  
A: No, I think they were ve
ry pleased to have arrived. I think that probably my  
mother shared the 
same idea about 
America
. I think my father, well, he was really 
never happy here. He wasn't happy in the 
camp  and he wasn™t 
happy later on when  
we lived in 
New York
, simp ly because he never regain
ed what he was, and he had 
very difficult time adjusting to 
being ju st an ordinary man. 
Q: Did you feel bad ab
out leaving the boat? 
A: No. No, not at all. 

Q: And then , wh en you got off the 
boat, wh ere did they take you? 

A: I guess we went on a train again to go up to  
Oswego,
 or I think we went straight 
up to 
Oswego
, we didn™t stay anyplace in between. 

Q: Had th ey prep ared you on th e boat for wh
ere they were going to be taking you? 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg 
July 29, 2000 

 

 
 
60
A: No. Not -- not that I knew,
 probably  my  parents knew,
 but I didn™t know. They 
probably  didn™t, because I know a lot of peopl
e were very, very disappointed  with the 
-- with the fence, and not bein
g able to -- to -- to leave
 Oswego
 itself, the -- I-I mean, 
Fort Ontario
 itself. N o t me. I was happy in that camp. So I -- and then we as 
children went to school, 
so we -- we did go to 
Oswego
. 
Q: Now, when you first got up there, ther
e was a quarantine, caus
e they didn™t know 
what kind of condition people were in and 
-- and you couldn™t le
ave. Was that hard 
for you? 
A: We couldn™t leave where? 

Q: Th-The confin es in the beginning. Ther
e was a quarantine. I guess they wanted to 
check peoples™ health -- 
A: First. 

Q: -- first, yeah. 

A: No, didn™t bother me one bit. 
Q: And you lived with yo
ur parents in the camp? 
A: Yes. We had two rooms. We had a barra
ck, in the barrack we
 had two rooms. One 
that -- room for me and my sister and one 
for my parents. They were connected. And 
then we had common mess halls, or eati
ng places and we had common recreational 
pro -- facilities and that was it. 
Q: And were -- were you near your friends from 
Yugoslavia,
 and -- living? 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg 
July 29, 2000 

 

 
 
61
A: Yes, we were all very near there, ye
 -- you know. Later on th
e boys devised some 
intercom systems or some kind -- that we could call each other. I don™t know what 
they -- they were also -- were very invent
iv e and th ey did these things and we could 
call each other on some kind of -- I do
n™t know, telephone thing that they 
constructed, or something like that. 

Q: And then you se -- yeah? 

A: But mostly we just ran from one barr
ack to the other if we wanted to see 
somebody th at we wanted to see, and th
en we all always met in that common 
recreational hall. 

Q: And what about school? 
A: We -- we were then assigned to school. 
My  sister went to -- to high school and I 
went -- was delegated to junior high school. 
Q: Now this is a 
school in the town? 
A: In the town of 
Oswego. 
And of course, I hated we -- go -- having to go to junior 
high school because 
Paul™s
 sister, who was my  age was telling if she could go to the 
high school, but I think they didn™t do it ag
e-wise, they just did it knowledge-wise, 
and obviously I didn™t know anything. Bu t 
of course, I didn™t know th at I didn™t 
know anything. Bu t anyway , 
Jeanette
 came with me to junior high school, even 
though she was older, so I th
ink the choice was mainly a choice of knowledge, rather 
than exactly age. 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg 
July 29, 2000 

 

 
 
62
Q: What was your impression of the American teenagers in your class? 
A: We had almo st nothing to do with them
. We despised the girls because our boys 
later on fabricated all k inds of -- of storie
s about what the American girls would do 
that we didn™t do, and we -- we were to
tally not knowledgeable about lipstick and -- 
and nail polish or any of the 
-- or any kind of cosmetics 
at all, or any kind of 
grooming, so we thought they were over
done and overdressed and over-silly, and we 
had ab solutely no contact whatsoever. We
 really disliked them intensely.  
Q: And the teachers? 

A: I personally had no -- no 
recollection or no impression of any teacher that was 
especially nice to me or especially interested
 in me, so -- but there were very variant 
experiences throughout the camp, because ma
ny of the people in high school adored 
their teachers. I know my friend 
Paul
 loved his -- his shop teach
er and he -- he used 
to make me  all kinds of wooden animals af
ter -- because of the shop teachers, and he 
-- he loved that one. And I know th at my  -- 
Elfie™s 
sister, who went to elementary 
school -- in fact, we saw a letter that sh
e wrote to her and she loved her. So it -- it 
was variant experience. But I think mainly I was so embittered of having to sit in 

junior high school, that was so mu ch belo
w my  dignity  that I really didn™t take to 
anybody there. 

Q: Did you notice a change in 
th e appearance of the other people that came  with you? 
In other words you all were -- had been 
under such difficult conditions before you 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg 
July 29, 2000 

 

 
 
63
got on th e boat, and I think y
ou had said that you didn™t 
realize it, it was because you 
yourself were not in good condition. 
Did you notice a -- a 
gradual physical 
improvement in the people? 
Q: Abso lutely yes, because I was always 
very conscious of cl
othes and appearances 
and so on. The first thing 
I knew is that my friend 
Jeanette 
got a whole ward robe 
shipped to her by some rela
tives or some distant friends or something th at was 
absolutely, to me the 
mo st beautiful, mo st fabulous clothes ever, and I was jealous as 
ca -- not really jealous, I just was very much 
taken by that. But we also had, I think, 
we got some money from some -- from my 
-- and my  cou -- my  distant cousin th at 
then pick ed us up when  we we
re released, and then we al
so had some visitors and I 
think some -- somehow my father got m
oney, so wh en it was permissible, I 
reme mb er going to  
Oswego
 and my mother and -- with my
 mo ther and sister and we 
bought dresses and we bought
 clothes and we bought some
 stuff. I mean, as far as 
I™m concerned now, they -- I™m su re 
Oswego
 was not a high fashion place for me. 
But to -- at me -- to me at 
that time, I™m sure it was fi
ne, because as I see from the 
pictures now, we had nice shorts, we ha
d nice blouses and stu
ff and we certainly 
didn™t look like bad -- lik
e -- like we u -- disheveled
 like when we arrived. 
Q: Were there many visitors? I know 
Eleanor Roosevelt
 came. Did you see her? 
A: Yes, I did, and she made a great impressi
on on me. We also had this lovely , lovely  
young women from 
Israel
, who organized us as the Zi
onist group, and who -- she 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg 
July 29, 2000 

 

 
 
64
was very -- I loved her a lot and she was ve
ry impressed with me and sh e liked me a 
lot, and -- 
Q: So you became a memb
er of this group? 
A: Oh definitely I was. Not my sister, sh
e didn't want to have anything to do with 
that.  

Q: And what did the Zionist group do? 

A: Oh we -- we danced, we -- we learned 
all the dances, which I loved. We sang 
songs, we -- I guess what a yo
uth group like that does, I -- 
Q: So th is woman came and stayed with you? 

A: Yes, she stayed in the camp for many,
 ma ny months and she -- she -- she did all 
these things with us. 

Q: Why do you think your si
ster was not interested? 
A: Oh, because she refused be
ing a Jew. She refu
sed being a Jew later on in life. She 
only accepted that she was Catholic, and she pr
etended to be the ca -- a Catholic the 
rest of her life and died as a Catholic. 

Q: Was that because you ha
d been in that school? 
A: No, no. I think it had to do with her othe
r lessons, that she was older when all this 
happened  to  her and I think 
she turned the other way. Ju
st as like my cousin, who 
was two years older than she was turned
 an extreme Zionist, went back to 
Israel 
and 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg 
July 29, 2000 

 

 
 
65
lived in the -- in -- on a kibbutz and raised
 her children there a
nd became an adamant 
supporter of 
Israel.
 My sister just went the other way. 
Q: Mm-hm. Because these things happ
ened to her becaus
e she was Jewish? 
A: Abso lutely. But she -- she -- 
she spend the rest of her life hiding the fact that she 
was Jewish. And she and I had 
numerous fights about that. 
Q: And she married? 

A: Yeah, she married my brother-in-law. 
Q: And he was on th e boat with  her? 
A: He was on the boat with her, right. 

Q: And he was Jewish? 
A: Well, he also had co nverted. He 
never recognized the Jewish faith. 
Q: So th ey both offi
cially converted? 
A: Well, no, because they both
 had ba -- they -- see, so ma
ny of us Jews converted in 
Euro pe
, as a matter of total -- of -- of -- of paperwork. So me people recognized it. 
The majority, I would say, in -- 99 
percent threw it in the garbage. 
Q: But your sister and brother-in-la
w just continued to live that way? 
A: Right. 
Q: Describe 
Eleanor Roosevelt™s
 visit, what you remember about that. 
A: Oh, I remember her as a marvelous la
dy, I loved her. I also saw her later at 
Queens College
 once. I -- I -- I was just crazy ab
out that woman, I think she was the 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg 
July 29, 2000 

 

 
 
66
na -- one of the few people in politics that
 I loved, adored an
d liked everything she 
ever did. And th e amazing thing to  me
 was, because I™m -- always was very 
conscious of physical appearances, and sh
e was not an attractive woman, but she was 
beautiful to me. In my eyes
, she was a beautiful wo man. 
Q: Did she speak to you direc
tly when you -- 
she came up? 
A: No, I think sh e -- she addressed the whol
e group or something like that. She didn™t 
speak to me directly on 
Queens College 
either. 
Q: Now, did the group in 
Oswego
 get together as -- the 
thousand of you as one 
frequently , or was that unusual? 

A: That was never. We stayed in groups.
 There was the Yugoslav group, there was 
the -- the other groups and -- and mo
st of us were Jewish anyway. 
Q: Then di -- what wa
s it like the day that 
F.D.R.
 died, April 12
th
, 1945? Do you 
have any memo ry of that? 

A: Not much, not much. Did he appr -- di
d he approve th at we could enter? No. 
Q: Did he approve th
at you could stay -- 
A: Yeah, th -- 

Q: -- after the war? No, he did not. 
A: No, never. 
Q: He wanted you to  go back . 

A: He wanted us to go back, yeah . 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg 
July 29, 2000 

 

 
 
67
Q: Okay , now, wh at were your thoughts? 
Did you think you™d be going back  to 
Euro pe
 when the war was over? 
A: I think I blanked it out. I totally blanked 
it out. I think I had this faith that once I 
was on American soil I was going to stay here
. I just never, ever -- as much as I was 
frightened in
 Europe
 of -- of what was happening an
d that I could be captured and 
that I could be killed and that I wouldn™
t be living, I think the moment I got on 
American -- the moment we were accepted to go to 
America
, to me this was an act 
of faith and I never, ever belie
ved that we were going back. 
Q: Apparently that first wint
er was a very hard winter. 
A: Very hard. 

Q: And some of the adults stopped wo rkin
g, you know, kind of revolted. Any -- any 
remembrance of that time -- of that winter? 
A: Well, I know that my father certainly 
didn™t work , and he wa
s very unhappy, but 
my mother wasn™t, she was 
-- she worked -- oh, 
she had like 10 jobs there, I don™t 
remember. She worked 
in the hospital, she 
worked in the kitche
n, she worked -- she 
was a member of every committee, she -- 
sh e loved it there. And -- I™m sorry f -- 
Gail. 
And no I don™t rememb er par
ticularly. We were so hap
py with each other, we -- 
we did so  many things. We had theater pe
rformances, we had 
relay races, we had 
sports, we had -- we -- we really had amus
ement from -- all the time, and we went to 
school, and we had a wonderful time.

Q: Now, did you take part in these 
-- any of these specific performances? 
A: Every single one of them, you c
ould be sure I was in that.  
Q: What were some of them? Were they
 origin al performances, or did you do 
performances of well known  plays and so fo rth? 
A: They were all original performances. 

Q: Who wrote them? 

A: I have no idea, no clue, but they 
were written by them, the music was written by 
them. I -- I was in -- in -- we -- we were singi
ng, I was a part of a choral society too, 

that 
Leon Leevich 
organized and directed and co nducted. And we -- we -- we -- we 
had rehearsals, we -- we made our own cost
umes, we -- we did everything, and I -- 
and I really didn™t care whether I had a majo
r part or a minor part or whether I was -- 
I was clumsy or not. We danced , we did a lot of things. 

Q: So for you morale was not a problem. 

A: None whatsoever. None whatsoever. Bu
t not everybody was like that. I remember 
my friend 
Jeanette
, who was much more reserved, 
and by the ti -- she was the most 
beautiful girl there. She was abso -- oh, ev
ery boy there was j -- was just crazy  about 
her. And I remember g o ing to her ho -- to 
her va -- barrack an-and she was ironing 
her dress she wa -- she was going to  wear th
at evening. And I said, how can you just 
stand there an iron? Why aren™t you ex c
ited? You™re going to  dance every single 
dance. And -- and she said, well it™s -- it™s
 just a dance. And I was hopping around, 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg 
July 29, 2000 

 

 
 
69
and I-I don™t know why because nobody ever
 asked me to dance. The only time I 
danced was because they 
wanted to dance with 
Jeanette, 
so they took me, you know 
what, to get a dance with he
r. But I was so excited about 
the dances, I was just -- I 
guess I was very optimistic, I don™t know. 
Q: Now, considering all the difficult physic
al things you went 
thro ugh as a young 
child, did you physically mature on 
time? Did you menstruate on time? 
A: Not at all. Not at all. I had great ri -- 
I -- my menstruation didn™t start til I was 18, 
even past 18. When I got marri
ed at 19, I didn™t menstruate
 for six months after that, 
and my  mother-in-law was -- was dancing ar
ound that I was pregnant, but I was not. 
And th -- it -- it was never okay, it -- the only 
time it got regulated is after I had my  

son. After that I had no more problem.  
Q: So do you credit that to your difficult 
situation that you went
 through as a young 
teenager? 

A: Definitely. Malnourishment and all thatstuff, definitely. My salvation, I always 
called it, w as 
America
, because I finally here got th
e correct food, and thank God, 
you know, I didn™t 
remain short and 
disformed
 and all that stuff. 
Q: Did you feel mu ch older as a 15 - 16 
year old at the time because you had been 
through such difficult conditions
 previously, or did you feel very f -- teenage-y, tee -- 
you know, 15 - 16 year old? 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg 
July 29, 2000 

 

 
 
70
A: I didn™t feel older, but I remember when I first got to 
New York
, I remember 
distinctly thinking, I stood still while the re
st of the world went on, and I have to 
catch up to it. 
Q: Now, this is when you got to 
New York
 after
 Oswego
 or befo re 
Oswego? 
A: After
 Oswego
, after
 Oswego
. I have to make up for all 
this tremendous time that I 
lost. And I did. I finished high school in 
tw o years and went to 
co llege and so  on and 
so forth. 

Q: When you were in 
Oswego
, were you lo oking forw ard to leaving, or were you ju st 
happy staying there? 
A: Very happy staying, but 
I was not very disturbed leav
ing, because we all left. 
Now, I lost -- a little bit I lost my friend 
Paul
 because he went to 
Philadelph ia
, but at 
the time he wrote me every single day a letter. 

Q: Well now -- was this a boy
friend or just a friend? 
A: Just a friend, I was ver -- we -- we -- I didn™t date anyone.  
Q: So you were in the camp 
for about a year and a half? 
A: Yes. Yeah.  
Q: And so you were ab out 16
 and a half when you left?  
A: Yes, right. 

Q: And everybody left at the same time? 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg 
July 29, 2000 

 

 
 
71
A: Yes, everybody left at the same
 time. A lot of people stayed in 
New York
 area, 
like my friend
 Jeanette, 
and 
Elfie 
stayed and 
David
 stayed, and a lot of people. And 
we used to meet as ga -- as 
-- as a group that stayed here
, and we used to do things 
together, for a long time. 
Q: Were there any farewell ceremonies wh
en people -- when it was time to leave
 
Oswego
? 

A: I don™t rememb er them. I don™t reme mb er
 them, if there were, I don™t know, I 
don™t remember. I don™t think so. 

Q: And you came to 
New Yo rk
 
City
 -- 
A: We came t -- 
Q: -- and wh at di -- where did you go? 
A: Okay , my  -- my  father™s second cousin pick
ed us up, took us to
 th eir apartment in 
the 
Bronx
. We stayed with her. I onl
y stayed with her a we -- 
a week or so and then 
my  cousin picked me up 
and brought me to the 
Hashara
 where she was preparing to 
go to 
Israel
, and I stayed with her 
about two or three weeks.
 And by the time I was -- 
I returned, my father alrea
dy had found an apartment on th
e east side and we had two 

rooms, I think, and a kitchen, someth
ing like that. A furnished apartment. 
Q: Had you thought about going to  
Israel
? 
A: Well, I was too young, I mean I -- I coul
 -- not in those terms. I didn™t do so  well 
on th e 
Hashara
. They put me in charge of eggs
, I broke all the eggs, they pr -- 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg 
July 29, 2000 

 

 
 
72
polishing eggs. They  put me in charge of 
polishing the horses, the horse kicked me. 
They finally told my cous
in , we love your cousin, but let her be a visitor. 
Q: What -- where was this located? 
A: In
 Jersey. 
Was a farm on 
Jersey. 
My cousin was terrific. She was -- she w as 
plowing the field, she was doing everything, 
and I -- I -- I lov -- I mean, I loved it. I 
danced all night with them, I -- w e sang a
ll the songs, that I was good at, but not -- 
not the cleaning of the eggs.  

Q: And you came back to yo
ur parents™ apartment. 
A: Yes, yes, and then  I went to 
Julia Richmond
 high school. 
Q: And you said that you ne
eded  to make up time. 
A: Abso lutely. I felt that, you kn
ow, the rest of the wo rld went on and I lost a lot of 
knowledge, and I was an avid reader. 
Q: I assume your Englis
h was quite good by then? 

A: No, it wasn™t terrific, because you kn
ow, we spoke exclus
ively Serbo-Croatian 
and Italian and at home I spoke German. So
 I -- my  English was rather poor, I would 
say, and I learned not very mu ch  in -- in
 the junior high school, because I really 
didn™t want to learn. I mean, I -- I helped
 my friend -- some of my friends pass some 
of the tests, but I don™t know -- but I mu
st have not learned too mu ch. My English 
was rather poor.  

Q: Were the teachers at 
Julia Richmond
 a help to you, being a refugee child? 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg 
July 29, 2000 

 

 
 
73
A: I think they were wonderfu
l. First of all th ey had cla
sses for s -- for people that 
didn™t know English, special 
classes, that™s where I met a
nother one of my  very close 
friends. And in fact, as an educator la
ter on, I reme mb er going to  the guidance 
department and saying that they should ma
ke such classe s, but they just refused. 
They weren™t interested, whic
h I thought was terrible. B u t it was a great help to me, 
and I had special speech cla
sses and they made it possibl
e for me to  finish high 
school in two years. I doub
led up in English and history 
and I got all my credits in 
languages. I had three years of German, thre
e years of Italian, three years of French, 
three years of Latin. 

Q: Did you become friendly with 
many of the American students? 
A: One or two, not many, one
 or two. No t many. My  -- 
Q: What did you -- what di
d you do in  your spare time? 
A: Well, I didn™t have that much. Oh, didn
™t have that man -- much spare time, and 
then one year later, I was already 16, I guess,
 or seven -- and my father insisted that I 
had to get a job. So  I wo rked  at
 Woolwo rth™s
, which I didn™t like, but I had to. I 
mean, he made me work. Not that he to
ok the money, I spent all the money on 
foolishness, but I -- I had to work, that was 
part of his requi -- requirement. E -- and 
my sister  was mar ried already, she was living in 
Bo ston
 with 
Alex
 and I used  to very  
often go up weekends and vis
it with him. But my  close friend was a French wa -- girl 
that had lost both her par -- parents in th
e Holocaust and her uncle, who was Russian, 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg 
July 29, 2000 

 

 
 
74
and a multi-millionaire searched all over 
Europe 
for her and her sister and brought 
them over. And she was a very close friend of 
mine and I saw a lot -- and of course I 
had 
Jeanette
 and I saw all my friends from
 Fort Ontario
, and that -- that was my 
life. 
Q: Did you tell people at 
Julia Richmond
 about your previous experiences? 
A: I never mentioned my  past to anyone. I 
never talked to it -- to my son about it, 
never to my first husband, never to my se
cond husband. The onl
y time that I admitted 
my  past was the first reunion th at I attended in -- in 
New York
, and through my 
friend
 Elfie
, who believed that the Holocaust should
 be heard, and I reconnected with 
her there and she™s -- she™s ve
ry -- she was interviewed by 
Spielberg
 and she™s -- she 
is very much a believer of -- of admitting 
the past, talking about the past and so on 

and so fo rth.

Beginning Tape Three, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of the 
United Sta tes 
Holocaust Memorial Museum 
volunteer collection interview with 
Dorrit Ostberg
. This is tape number three, side
 
A.
 And you were saying 
how you hadn™t talk
ed about your --  
A: Not at all. 
Q: -- experiences before. And so  when you 
were in high school you -- obviously you 
-- wha-wh at did people -- what did yo
u say to -- to the other students? 
A: Simply that I came from 
Europe
 and I was born in  
Vienna
 and that I was Je wish, 
but that™s it.  

Q: And did you experience any anti-Semitism at 
Julia Richmond? 
A: Yes, I did. 

Q: Such as? 

A: The only time that 
I even came close to it was that
 I made friends with this one 
little Italian  girl, and my father had informed
 me that I w as much too stupid to go to 
college. So I applied for the job at a bank, an
d I went with her for the interview, and I 
-- I was very enthusiastic at that time 
and I told them all 
about my  language 
experiences and so on, and I thought I was a 
fantastic candidate for them, and I didn™t 
get the job, and she did. And I thought I 
was -- there was no question she -- she -- sh 
-- that, you know, I was brighter and had mo
re -- mu ch mo re experience and so  on 
for the job. And the guidance counselor at
 the time told me, we
ll you simply didn™t 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg 
July 29, 2000 

 

 
 
76
get the job because they proba
bly realized you were Jewi
sh, and there™s -- the banks 
are very anti-Semitic. 
Q: And what was your reaction, especia
lly after what you had gone through? 
A: Frankly, I was happy about it, because I r
eally didn™t want the job. I wasn™t happy 
about the anti-Semitism, but I kind of ru -- 
shugged
 it off, because 
New York
 is not 
the place where you feel too much of the anti-
Semitism. And I just 
didn™t really want 
to face it at all, so I was ve
ry happy to go to college. 
Q: And where did you go to co llege? 
A: 
Queens College
. 
Q: And what did you study? 
A: Well, my father insisted that 
[tape break]
 my father insisted that I know what I 
was going to  study, well I had no clue what 
I was going to  study. So  I ran in, and my  
-- my  brother-in-law was there visiting and he
 was always my best friend and I said, 
Alex
, you got to help  me, you got 
to convince Father what I™m -- I -- you have to tell 
me what to study. He said, a wonderfu
l thing for you study is biochemistry. I 
marched into my father™s room and I said, 
I™m going to study biochemistry. He said, 
okay, you are allowed to go. I flunked my  
ch emistry, because I never learned how to  
-- how to  light the lighter. I didn™t do so well 
in my  biology either, but I was put in an 
advanced literature course in German and 
I then majored in co
mparative literature, 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg 
July 29, 2000 

 

 
 
77
changed my  major, my father didn™t know
 about it and that™s what I studied and 
majored in. 
Q: And for how long did you go? 
A: Four years. 
Q: And what happened after -- soon after y --
 you got married though, didn™t you, in 
between? 

A: Very quickly. I got married th -- wh
en I was 19 because my sister was 19 when 
she got married and I had to get married at 19, so I did that. 

Q: How did you meet your husband? 

A: I met him because I was tutoring him in
 the German, he was flunking German and 
he was very  bad at it. So I -- and he wa
s much older than I was and I was very 
impressed. I had never been on dates, I ha
d never gone out. And 
we had a couple of 
dates, and then he had to leave and 
so we got engaged in a month or so. 
Q: And ha -- what did your
 parents think of that? 
A: They were v -- th-they weren™t there f -- 
at -- at that time I was alone in -- in 
New 
York
 at the time. My father pr
ovided me with a -- with a 
-- an old -- not old, I guess 
it was a young wo man of 30 years old, who was desperate to get ma rried, who was 
supposed  to cook fo r me, she 
never cooked for me. But she 
told me that the first man 
that asked me to marry, I had to  get marri ed because, I don™t know, I shouldn™t miss 
out the opportunity. 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg

78
Q: Where were your parents living? 
A: They were living with 
me, but they had gone to 
Europe
. My father went back to 
Euro pe
 to reinstate his pension a
nd to  do some business in 
Europe
 with his firm. 
They went for a month 
or so in the summer. 
Q: Oh, I see, and then you -- 

A: And that™s when I got engaged to my  husband. 

Q: And was your husband Jewish? 
A: Yes.  
Q: And w-what was his name? 

A: 
Haro ld --
 at this time, 
Wochstoch
, that we changed to 
Wesley. 
Q: And why did you change it? 

A: I hated the name. 

Q: And he was amenable to this? 

A: He was amenable.  
Q: And so th en did you come
 back to -- did you live in 
New York 
the whole time 
after you got married? 
A: After we got married, I lived in 
Oklahoma City 
for about four months or so 
because he -- 

Q: Why? 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg 
July 29, 2000 

 

 
 
79
A: My husband went to school there beca
use he couldn™t fill the req u irements at
 
Queens
, so he transferred to 
Oklahoma City College
 or something, 
a small college. 
The only one in th -- I think in all of 
United States
 that didn™t need a da -- a language 
requirement. And we got married in 
New York
 when my father came back in 
October, and they all rushed me to get married
 because he wasn™t going to be here in 
the summer. And I got married. I -- I loved 
having a big wedding 
ring, I loved telling 
everybody I was married, that 
they had to address me as 
-- as Mrs. and not as Miss. 
And then I came back to wi -- to 
New York 
and I went back to 
Queens College. 
Q: And you got your degree? 
A: And I got my  degree. 
Q :  A n d  th en  wh at h a pp en ed ? 
A: I started  -- well, I w as accepted at
 Columbia
, because they were one of the -- 
Colu mbia
 graduate school, that they were one of
 the few schools that had a course in 
comparative literature at the 
time. But we had no money wh
atsoever and I ug -- so I 
didn™t go, and I went to work as a weight
s engineer, where my 
-- my husband worked 
as a technical writer at 
Republic Avia tion
 in 
Farm ingdale. 
Q: And then ? 
A: And then  I had my  son an
d I stopped wo rking for awhile. And then afterwards I 
started working for an opti
cal company because I met one of the wives that the 
[indecipherable]
 husband worked there as a partner, at an 
ORT 
meeting that I was 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg 
July 29, 2000 

 

 
 
80
very into , I was on th e board  of the
 ORT. 
And I took a part time job and I got my 
divorce, and I went back to
 school to become a -- a schoolteacher and I was -- I 
taught mathematics fo r about 20 years. A
nd I chose mathematics b ecause at th e time 
languages they weren™t interest
ed in, but they were very in
terested in math. They had 
a -- they didn™t have en ough math teachers. An
d I used to be good at math in college 
when  I first started, but I had a lot of study 
to do fo r that, and that
™s -- that -- that was 
it.  
Q: And where did you teach? 
A: I taught at 
North Sh ore High School
, which was right near my home for the first 
year -- two years, and then I transferred to 
Kennedy High School 
in 
Bellmore.  
Q: And did you ever remarry? 

A: I remarried twice since then. 

Q: An-And to whom did you marry -- remarry? 

A: I married an 11 year -- 11 year younge
r man for the second time, who was not 
Jewish and I divorced him 11 
years later. And then I was 
alone for about nine years 
or so, and then I married my  present husband, who is Jewish. 

Q: And your parents? What -- what happene
d with them? They -- they came -- they 
stayed in the 
New York
 area? 
A: My parents stayed in the 
New York
 ar-area. My father died when my son was 
about eight or nine years old, 
and my  mo ther lived to be 92. 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg 
July 29, 2000 

 

 
 
81
Q: What about the other extended fam
ily that you haven™t mentioned, in 
Vienna
, 
much more extended than just 
the cousins. Did you ev er h
ear what happen
ed to them, 
or -- you -- you talked about some of them 
[indecipherable]
 some going to  
Israel
 
and so fo rth. 
A: Oh, you -- 

Q: Did you get any -- after the war, did you
 hear any more a
bout what happened? 
A: Well, my mother™s brother. My mother™s
 brother was put in a concentration camp  
in 
France
. He was able to escape. He -- he had an -- a non-Jewish w-wife who was 
partially aristocratic I think, w
ho went into  exil -- she went to 
Belgiu m
 and she hid 
him during the war, the whole during th e war. 
Q: What -- what was his name? 
A: His name was -- 

Q: That™s all right. 

A: This is terrible that I can™t reme
m -- can™t thi -- his wife™s name was 
Marianne 
Hugo -- Hugo -- Hugostern.
 His name was 
Hugostern
. And he went back to 
Vienna
 with his wife after the war. They neve
r had any ch ildren, and they -- he died 
there and sh e lived long afterw
ards and she also died in 
Vienna
. 
Q: Can we talk now a little bit about some of
 your thoughts about the experience that 
you went through? Do you fe
el, because of what -- what you went through as a 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg 
July 29, 2000 

 

 
 
82
young ch ild that you would ha
ve been a different person 
if you hadn™t gone through 
these -- did this affect you 
in th e way you are today? 
A: Abso lutely. There™s no question about it. 
Q: In what way? 
A: In many, many ways. I mean, I -- I don™
t think that psychologically I™m totally 
there where I should be. I definitely thin
k all my  divorces stemmed from that. I™m 
sure I have a lot of insecurities. I -- I -- 
Q: Wh-W h-Why do you th ink your divorces 
stemmed from what you went through? 
A: Simp ly from the experience of
 my other friends from col -- from 
Fort On tario
. 
My friend 
David
 is on his fourth wife, my friend 
Elfie
 is divorced, my  friend 
Jeanette 
is divorced, my fr -- her ex
-husband had two or three wives. Very few of us 
were able to really -- one of the exception is my friend 
Paul.
 He -- he married and 
stayed married for -- for 50 ye
ars or 40 years or whatever. 
He is an exce -- there™s 
some exceptions, but many, many of us have had -- 

Q: But why is that? 
A: I would -- I would think be
cause of the -- of the insecu
rities, expectations, really 
interrupted lives, really  -- I mean
, a million -- millions of reasons. 
Q: Is there anything today th
at, anything th at you see sometimes, or you hear or you 
smell that remind you of the difficult tim
es during the war, that bring it back? 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg 
July 29, 2000 

 

 
 
83
A: Yes, ma ny times. Movies bring it back . 
I -- I reme mb er vividly one movie with 
J ane Fo nda
 and the ride on the train, wher
e she was smuggling some anti-Na zi 
material or something, and all of a sudden
 I felt what I felt on the train when I was 
seven years old. And there are other movies
. I -- I -- I saw a movie with my friend 
Jeanette
 there th -- see, we -- there are cert
ain va -- basic things. You asked me 
previously, did we ever talk
 about our past experience. 
And we rarely did. It was 
much more of that we knew and we felt the sa
me thing. It™s very hard to explain. I 
saw the movie east w -- 
East West
 with her. And frankly it™s 
not really related to the 
Holocaust, but all because
 it™s -- it™s -- it™s 
Russia
 and it™s 
France
, but the oppression 
and the fear and all that, and -- and we both sa
id we were so happy that we didn™t see 
it with anybody else but each other, becaus
e we both knew exactly how we felt and 
what disturbed us and what 
-- you can never get rid of that fear. Even today I am 
petrified when I see a policeman in a car wh
en  I am driving. I totally always do a big 
sigh of relief when he passes me  and does
n™t stop me. Even though I know I™m not 
speeding, I™m not doing anything, I™m just plain riding a car. It™s unbelievable. Never 
ceases. And that™s probably partially the r
eason that I hate, detest guns, detest any 
sort of violence, cannot stand violence 
in any form and really do not read a 
newspaper. And even when I lis
ten to the news, I automatica
lly shut them off. I listen 
to the weather, I know what the weather 
is, I know -- and half the news, unless I 
make a conscious effort to lis
ten, I do not hear. And I™m -- I™m
 sure this is all related. 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg 
July 29, 2000 

 

 
 
84
There™s no question it™s all related . I have 
been  in therapy, many of my  friends have 
been in therapy, 
I mean it™s --  
Q: Has it been of help? 
A: I guess so, because I mean, I -- I -- I -- 
I don™t think I™m a very disturbed or very 
horrible person, but I -- you know, especi 
-- this is also, you know, one of those 
questions, how do you know 
th erapy helps? You don™t k
now because you don™t know 
how you would have done without it. So it™
s -- it™s not really an easy question to 
answer and -- and wh en we have absolute
ly no proof unless you™
ve had -- you were 
committed and had a mental 
breakdown, then  you know
 if you got better. But -- I 
mean, my friend 
Mimi
 has been in  therapy fo r many 
years, and is no lo nger, but 
that™s the one who lo st her two friends in 
the Holocaust. We all -- we -- I feel we are 
all marked. There is no ques
tion on th at. I even sometimes
 feel my son is marked, 
because I raised him, and some of my reac
tions to raising him. Either that or it™s 
inherited, I don™t know. He is -- he -- he ha
s a lot of sense of insecurity, which I don™t 
like to see, and which I -- I don™t rememb er 
him having as a child. So, us old Jewish 
mothers, I™m sure 
it™s my fault.  
Q: What -- wh-w hen your son was the -- the 
eight -- and speaking of your son, when  
he was, let™s say, eight and a half, when
 things started to get difficult for you. 
A: I was six wh en I divorced my  son -- my  husband. 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg

Q: No, no, no, no, th at™s not wh at I mean
t, I meant when your 
son was the age that 
you were -- you were when  
Hitler
 came  in and th ings started to get bad. 
A: Yes. 
Q: When he turned that age, did 
that mean anything special to you? 
A: No. Abso lutely -- 
Q: Do you know wh at I™m saying? 
When he became the age you were. 
A: Yes, no, absolutely not. No , no, never 
even thought of it in those terms, no. 
Q: When he was the age of you at
 different times of your childhood? 
A: No. I mean, he was -- it was still a di
fficult age for him because I was divorced 
when  he was six years old. So , it took hi
m -- and then my husb
and remarried when 
he was about eight and a half, I think. 
So he did go throu
gh difficult times -- 
Q: Yeah. 

A: -- but I don™t think that was related to my experience when I was in 
Euro pe
. 
Q: Are you angry that you had to go th r
ough such a terrible time in your life and 
others didn™t? 

A: Not at all. No. No. A -- s-sa -- I-I was 
very lucky. For -- people that really went 
through bad times, the people th
at were killed, that saw thei
r family killed, that were 
in horrible concen tration camp s, that we
re tortured. I had none of that. No.  
Q: But there were also people your age 
who were living here 
and didn™t go through 
any of wh at you went through. 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg 
July 29, 2000 

 

 
 
86
A: Well, they were living in a different coun
try. No, I never felt that way. I felt, in 
the way I always felt, that I wished that 
my father had accepted
 the position when he 
was offered it, e -- and -- and left
 Euro pe
 when he wa -- when -- when his first 
opportunity came to go to
 America
, because I think we woul
d have -- I would have 
had a different lifestyle. Now, whether th
at would have made me happier, I don™t 
know. I think yes, in a sense, 
because I -- a-another thing th at
 I feel is a total sense of 
displacement. I never really feel as an 
American, and I never feel as a European. 
When I™m in 
Europe
 I feel American, when I™m in 
America,
 I feel European. And I 
-- there is n o  way that I really belong. 
And -- and there are many, many signs. For 
instance, my house, I -- I never, ever rearra
nge anything in my  house. It™s -- it™s very 
weird. I furnish it, and if I just put an asht
ray in another place, it bothers me. I mean 
sometimes things have to be
 thrown out or replaced, not
 talking about that. But I 
know that many of my  friends
, the husbands used to say,
 I -- I alw ays come home to 
a different home, every day there is a 
different way of -- of arranging and 
rearranging. I have never rearranged a room. 
Q: Why? 

A: I don™t know. Must be that I want thin
gs as it is, and there™s a certain security. 
And I hang onto things that I don™t -- I haven™t 
sold my  house that I used to live in. I -

- there™s no question I don™t wi 
-- you know, I -- I have a lot 
of my mother™s stuff that 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg

is sitting in the basement. 
I haven™t gone through it, I 
haven™t touched it and I will 
not. 
Q: Are your friends mostly people from 
Europe
? 
A: No. My friends are American.
 Judy 
is American, 
Laurel
 is American, I have 
many American friends, and I have merry 
-- ma -- I have a few European friends. 
Q: When  you get togeth er with these Euro
pean friends now, do 
you talk about the 
past? 
A: We never talked about the past. I don™t -- 
Q: I mean -- I mean now. 

A: A little bit with 
Jeanette
. Only in relationship to that 
I -- she did come with me to 
the n -- to the second reuni
on. She was like me, we never talked -- she and I never 
talked about anything. And she 
just now also is ready to 
talk a little bit about it. And 
in fact, we™ve -- we™ve -- just 
talking about this movie that they™re doing and I have -- 
I -- half of me says yes I™m going, the othe
r half says no I™m not going. I know -- I 
refused sp -- 
Spielberg
, I refused an interview with 
Spielb erg
.  
Q: Why? 

A: I just didn™t want to. I -- I felt my 
story wasn™t important enough, interesting 
enough. I -- I -- I hate to dramatize what has happened to  me, because I think it™s 

nothing in relationship to wh at 
has happened  to other people. 

Q: But your life was d e
finitely in danger. 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg 
July 29, 2000 

 

 
 
88
A: Was very much in danger. 
But I survived. I was lucky en
ough to survive. I wasn™t 
tortured. I was hungry, so wh
at. They have millions of Am
erican children that don™t 
have enough to eat, 
and they™re hungry.  
Q: Did it affect how you -- your thoughts 
about your students, your teaching, your 
attitude towards your students? 
A: I don™t know. Wh ich way do you -- 

Q: Well, a simp -- a connectio
n with them, a symp athy with them, because you™re a 
child -- your -- that time in
 your life was so difficult. 
A: Maybe yes, maybe ye -- yes and no. I -- pa
rt of me is still very Austrian and I 
guess Germanic, and I -- now I™m laughing 
about it because I am retired and 
everything. I was absolutely mu
ch too strict about a certain
 concept. I still remember 
being with my  brother-in-la
w and one of the anecdote
s were that they had a 
radiologist who was teaching the internist 
and he would say -- he would show them 
slides, and he would say, what is this 
on the slide? And the man would say, it™s a 
kidney. And he would say it™s excellent, 
excellent answer. Wo
nderful answer. It 
would be better if you had said it was the live
r. So, I never forgot that because I used 
to get sick when they didn™t
 reme mb er a formula. And I used to be angry and they 
had to memorize the formula. It w as stupid. I mean, what does a formula do? 
Abso lutely nothing. A kidney a
nd a liver, if h e takes it o u t,
 that means a lot. So I -- 
that was the bad part. The good part wa
s that I had -- since I went back to 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg 
July 29, 2000 

 

 
 
89
mathematics at such a late age and I ha
d such a gap to do,
 I -- I-I prepared 
wonderfully. I never assigned a problem I didn™t wo rk  through first, and I knew  
exactly where they were going
 to be hung up. And I unde
rstood of them blacking out 
and being afraid and -- and 
not being ab le to achieve. That I was good at. I was also 
very gullible. I had a kid th
at told me his fath er -- he couldn™t do his homework 
because his father was dying of cancer, I was 
in tears, I -- I told him how my sister 
died and everything. I ran down  to -- oh, he 
got in trouble with me
, he almost hit me. 
So he was -- he was -- w-w-we -- I was in fr
ont of the assistant principal and he said, 
you know, this kid, he lies 
a lot. You see what position you
 put me? I have to call the 
father now and see whether the mother or
 whatever -- th-the mother now and see 
whether the father is really dying. You know 
something? He made it all up, this kid. 
Made the whole story up. So there are thi
ngs that were good and th ings that were 
bad. 

Q: How often do you think about your past now? 
A: Now? 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: I guess it comes in spurts. Right now I 
think a lot because 
of the interview, 
because of -- of having to 
relive it, which is not so eas y for me. Most of the time I 
don™t like to think about it. 
I™m still the same way. Bu t 
I™m convinced now th at it has 
to be addressed, that it has to be done
 and I™m so grateful to you for doing this 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg 
July 29, 2000 

 

 
 
90
because now it™s for my re -- granddaughte
r, because she™s only three and by the time 
she™s grown up, I™m going to be real old. 
And she has a place that if she wants to 
know wh at her grandmother™s life was lik
e, she can listen  to it. And that I™m 
internally grateful to you, because of course, I™m nuts about my  granddau ghter. 
Q: What are your thoughts about being Jewish now? 

A: I™ve always liked being Jewish, but I wa
s never a religious Jew. I did go and I 
always go -- I used to go every year -- it™
s very funny, I -- I do observe Yom Kippur. 
I used to fast, I no longer fast because of 
age, difficulty with medication and so on. I -
- I used to go and -- and -- and 
pr -- to the Prayer for the 
Dead for my father. I never 
joined a temp le, my  son never had a 
Bar Mitzvah
, simply because my first husband 
didn™t want to pay fo r it, I couldn™t pay fo
r it, and I was very angry because I wanted 
to just send him to religious school just
 for the training and they  wouldn™t do th at. I 
would have had to jo in the congregation, a
nd I couldn™t afford it.
 I f -- simply could 
not afford it. And I wo
uld have given him the 
Bar Mitzvah
 on those terms. And 
then, I™m very rebellious, I -- I -- I don™t 
-- I didn™t want to be forced in doing 
something I don™t want to do, and I really di
dn™t want to join a co
ngregation. I don™t -
- as I said, I love -- I love being in a temp le fo r the singing, and I like the ceremony, I 
like the feeling, I like feeling I™m
 Jewish, but I™m not religious. 
Q: Even though negative things happe
ned to  you because 
you were Jewish? 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg 
July 29, 2000 

 

 
 
91
A: Yes, definitely. I -- I -- I don™t think that
™s the fault of being Jewish. I think that 
happens all over the wo rld to a lot of peop
le. A lot of people are persecuted because 
of their race, religion and -- and beliefs, and -- 
Q: Why did you go back 
to the first reunion, the 
Oswego
 reunion? 
A: I didn™t go to the first first 
Oswego
 reunion. I went to the first meeting in 
New 
York
, because -- why did I go? I don™t know. I 
just decided that 
I would like to go. 
Maybe to see some old friends, to make conn
ection. Almost walked out of there, but 
I -- 

Q: Why? 

A: Because at first I didn™t recognize anyo
ne. And I did go alone. I don™t remember 
whether my  son went with me or not. I 
don™t remember. Anyw
ay, but then I met 
Elfie
 and we became fast friends. I was divor
ced at the time, she was divorced and 
we liked each other. And -- and then of cour
se I was very much into it. I -- I liked 
going back to the reunions
 and I met my frien d
 Irene
 from -- from 
California
 and 
many friends. And my friend from 
Chicago
. 
Q: What was it like to go up to
 Oswego
? 
A: Strange. Very strange. 
Q: Why? 
A: Well, because things have just change
d so much, you know, 
the whole fort has 
changed. People have changed. I didn™t re
cognize many of the people. You know, we 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg 
July 29, 2000 

 

 
 
92
are all old, and -- and what -- 
what bothers me now is that there™s so few of us that 
are still alive. So many of us have died. 
Q: Even the people that were your age? 
A: Even my contempora
ries, yeah. My friend
 Evol 
just died. I -- many, many from 
my  immediate group. Forg et my  sister™s group 
and fo rget the real old ones. In fact, at 
the last reu n ion, which was just the 55
th
 reunion, I was amazed , ther e was some body 
there that was a baby in the camp, that wa
s two or three months old when -- when -- 

when he was in camp. So ther
e are very few of us left. Especially the last one, there 
was maybe 20 su rvivors that came to the ca
mp or something, or 30. It™s amazing. 
Q: Did you walk around your 
old barrack and walk around? 
A: Yeah, we went to 
[indecipherable]
 th-those are the pictures
 I showed you of -- of 
the old -- old fort and stuff like that, yeah. 
Q: When you do that are yo
u transported back in time? 
A: Yes, we are, because to me it w a
s a good experience, yeah, definitely.

 What 
are your thoughts on th e state of 
Israel 
now? 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg 
July 29, 2000 

 

 
 
93
A: I f -- well, I have my cousin there, I™
m very, very fond of. In fact, her -- her 
granddaughter is here n o w that I am just nuts about it, 
Racheli
, she™s 21 years old. 
She™s here on a visitor™s visa. But I -- I™
m a little confused. I™m -- I™m disappointed 
that the peace treaty has not been ratified.
 On the other hand, I was walking with 
Rach eli
 on the street, and -- and a strange ma
n, he mu st have -- she™s gorgeous -- 
stopped us and said, don™t le
t your government give aw ay any mo re land. Don™t let 
that happen. So I™m torn betw
een that they worked
 so hard to attain
 what they have, 
and now they have to give up some. On th
e other hand, I really abhor fighting and I 
abhor the terror that they liv
e through, so I would like to
 see peace come. So I -- I 
don™t know, you know, I™m not very political. 
But I am -- I am extremely happy that 
Israel 
exists. I™m extremely supportive of 
Isr ael
, and I -- I -- I -- in the politics, I 
don™t know where the comp romise should 
lie. Neither do many others, I think. 
Q: What are your thoughts about 
Germany
? 
A: Well, I -- I don™t hate 
Germany
. I -- I don™t like 
Germany
, but I -- when I went 
back to
 Vienna
 it was very anti-Semitic. Now 
-- now my fren -- my cousin 
Susie
 will 
not step into  
Austria
, will not step into 
Germany
, you know, doesn™t want to have 
anything to do with it, and 
doesn ™t -- never wants to go b
ack. I was glad to go back. I 
still have a sentim
entality towards 
Vienna
 that has nothing to do
 with really -- it has 
more to do with the opera, with
 the music, with the life, w
ith the -- with the arts and 
all that. Has nothing to do with
 the anti-Semitism that is re
ally ramp ant there, there™s 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg 
July 29, 2000 

 

 
 
94
no question about it. It™s a mixed feeling. On  one had I want all the re -- I applied for 
that -- for this new thing abou
t the settlement of bi -- as far as I™m concerned, I can™t 
get enough money out of 
Austria
 for me, personally, if I c
ould. I do get a pension 
and I just now applied for th
is thing with the bank settle
ments, but it seems that my 
father only had a box there and not a bankbo ok and I guess nothing will come of that 

claim.  But that way I f -- I don™t -- you know, I feel v-venge -- 
veng enful 
of -- a 
vengeance kind of thing,
 but not really. But 
I -- I will listen to 
Wa gn er,
 I will listen 
to -- to German music, that doesn™t bothe
r me. I -- I like the music per se, I think it 

transgresses what people ar
e and what their political be
liefs are. I don™t think it 
translate -- I will -- I w ould drive -- well,
 may b e I wouldn™t drive a German car, 
because of the economy, ba 
-- I -- I -- I don™t really know. I -- I have very mixed 
emotions about that. 
I would go back to 
Vienna
 again, even though there is such 
anti-Semitism, simply for seei
ng some more, because I only
 was one or two days in 
Vienna
. I really didn™t see enough of what 
was. Maybe it™s not even there any mo re, 
but -- 

Q: Did you have any partic
ular thoughts during th e 
Eichmann 
trial? 
A: I -- no. I -- my thought was killing him 
doesn™t do any good at all, doesn™t bring 
back the thousands and thousands of Jews. 
I think killing anybody 
-- I -- I am against 
capital punishment, I am. Very strongly. I -- I -- I don™t -- I don™t see -- killing makes 

killing, I believe. Not that I wanted even 
[indecipherable]
 I™m not going that far. But

in prison and for life would be good eno
ugh for me. I don™t know, I -- I guess I -- I™m 
not too v -- vengeance means nothing to me. 
Doesn™t bring back anyone, doesn™t do 
any good. 
Q: When things were 
going on in the former
 Yugoslavia
, did you feel any kind of 
connection? 
A: A great connection, because I understo
od what was going on, and I -- I fai -- I 
mean, these atrocities ar-are 
-- are just horrendous. I can™
t fathom -- I always say we 
made such advances in technology, in -- 
in science and everything. We -- we -- we 
have made no advances 
in humanity. That today, in this  age, this killing, this raping, 
these atrocities can happen, simply means th
at we -- we™ve concentrated in the wrong 
interests. We™ve -- we vai -- we should -- 
we should make advances in humanity, not 

in -- not in science any mo re, and technology. 

Q: The fact that you had lived there, 
did you feel any kind of connection? 
A: Big connection, because I 
know of the hatred, I know 
of the differences. And in  
one way it was only a strong man like 
Tito
 that could bri -- that could hold it 
together.  

Q: Since your family and you and many othe
rs were deprived of their civil rights 
when 
Hitler
 came into power, did the Civil Rights movement here in the 
United 
States
 reverberate with you in any way? 

 
Interview with Dorrit L. Ostberg 
July 29, 2000 

 

 
 
96
A: Why sure, I was, you know, I™m quite liberal
 in -- in -- in my  beliefs and certainly 
believe that everybody has a right t -- to be 
ai -- but they -- you know, there -- there™s 
so many different issues and so many different
 things and as mu ch as I believe that 
the gays have every right, that this one ha
s every right to be human, I -- I have mixed 
emotions. For instance, I-I™m not 
so sure that I totally approv
e of this thing that went 
on in 
Italy
 right now, during th ey -- their centenni
al, their big -- their big thing with 
the gay parade, or whatever that they 
[indecipherable]
 I -- I -- I think it was 
inappropriate in -- in the timing, I don™t know. All this -- I don™t like any extreme 
groups anyway, and I don™t like any ex tremists
 in their movements and wh at they do. 
Q: Do you feel that you, as
 some people have said, that you are two people, one 
person on the outside and 
one person on th e inside, be
cause of wh at you went 
through? 
A: No. I think I™m two people in
side and two people outside.  
Q: What do you mean by th at? 
A: I have very mixed emotion internally. I -- 
I don™t think that I™m 
-- I™m -- I™m -- I -- 
I™m not as -- as -- even thou
gh I refused to talk about my
 past, it -- it wasn't because I 
wasn™t open, or communicative, or that I coul
dn™t relate to other people, or that I had 
a secret life inside of me. I -- I -- I don™
t believe that. I don™t believe that I put on a 
different front outside. I am what I am. I 
may look different on th e outside because 
I™m very conditioned by fashion, by trad
ition, by -- by so -- by money that can buy

97
things and so on and so fort
h. But I -- I don™t think that I™m
 so mu ch di -- I think I™m 
very conflicted inside too, of -- of -- of
 how -- how things should be, or I -- e-e -- 
about strong beliefs, about -- about a lot of things. Abou
t wh ere I belong and what I 
am and what -- what contributions we 
have made and so on and so forth. 
Q: Do you feel you tru -- you 
belong here? You did say when
 you were here you feel 
European and wh
en you™re in 
Euro pe
 you feel American, but do you feel that you 
belong here? 
A: I don™t f -- no, I don™t feel I belong anyplace. I don™t. I mean, you try to feel that 
this is your home, I™m alwayshappy to  go back to the hom
e, or the house that I live 

in when I go away on
 vacation. But I, truthfully, no. I -- I -- I don™t feel the stability, I 
don™t feel these are my roots, okay?
 I don™t feel roots with anything. 
Q: When you became an American c
itizen, what thoughts did you have? 
A: Oh, I was thrilled. I -- I -- I™m extremely grateful to
 America
. I was thrilled to 
become an American citizen
. The nicest experience I had, when my  granddaughter 
became an American citizen. She had to 
after she was adopted . She was two years 

old when  she -- when  they went through 
th e ceremony, I mean, what ceremo ny, she -
- she -- she -- she had a flag in
 her hand. I mean, wh at can she do at two, she couldn't  
talk. But I -- you know, I was extremely happy about that. 

Q: Did you feel a connection with her then? 

A: I guess so. I guess so. I guess so.

Q: You said that you th ink about your chil
dhood mo re as you™ve gotten older, and -- 
and obviously with your grandd
au ghter. Any other reason?  
A: Well, I guess mu st -- mu st be grow old 
-- you know, I deplore the fact that I™m 
very mu ch  alone, that I don™t have any fa
mily left, that my 
sister died, that -- 
Q: Did she have children? 
A: No. She had no ch ildren. I 
-- I mean, you know, the closes
t to my age in family is 
my  cousin in  
Israel
, and -- and I have an older cousin in 
Detroit
, but I don™t feel that 
close to her. And I really, you know, it™s -- 
it™s -- I love -- you know, I love what 

she™s done with her life. She has -- she ha
s three children and 10
 grandchildren sitting 
on th e kibbutz. Almo st everywhere -- eight of them live on th e kibbutz, I mean, it™s 
wonderful. And I miss that and I™m very co
ncerned about even having this one, only 
one grandchild that is all alone and my  son 
being all alone, having 
no brothers or si-si 
-- has a half sister, but -- my first husband remarried. 
Q: Have you been  to 
Israel
 frequently? 
A: Oh yeah, about five, six 
times, yeah. In fact
, I stayed for about two weeks or 10 
days I think, on the kibbutz with  my  cousin. 

Q: What does it feel lik e for you to be there? 
A: I like it a lot. I like bein
g with her. A wa -- it™s hard 
though, because I don™t speak 
any Hebrew, but I liked it. I like being with
 her, I love her, I™m 
very fond of her, I

think she™s terrific. She came here a couple
 of times and stayed when we -- it™s v ery 
nice. It™s a good connection. 
Q: Well, is there anything 
you -- anything you wanted to add, or an ything, any 
message you wanted to give your little grandd
aughter? Anything you wanted to say? 
A: Well, I guess the only thing is I hope 
she once listens to it. That™s about it. 

Q: Well, you gave her a wo
nderful gift, you truly did.  
A: I think, 
Gail,
 you gave her a wo nderful gift
, not me. I think th e credit goes 
entirely to you. 

Q: Well, thank you very, ve
ry much for doing this -- 
A: Thank you fo r doing this, really.
