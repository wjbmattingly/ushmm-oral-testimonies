reviews. In today™s conversation, we want to address the experiences of Dr. 
Weinberg
 and his famil y i n Nazi 
Germany
, but above all , we want t o trace the 
making of a Holocaust scholar. Dr. 
Weinberg
, welcome, and thank you for taking 
the ti me to record this i nterview. I t hought  we™d start with some conversations about 

your family. If you could sa y something about  your father, your father™s occupati on, 
your mother™s background. How would you describe the social positi on of your 
family back in 
Hanno ver
? 
Answer: My father had gone to the university to train in law. Was a judge briefl y, 

before the first World War, and served in the German army. Wounded, and 

promoted, and so on. After the war, he was dissatisfied with the at mosphere in the 

judiciary, and transferred to the new Mini stry of Finance. He was, to begin with, 

assigned to 
Turnowiec
(ph) in 
Upper Silesia
, and after the plebisci te, when that 
area voted for 
Poland
, he was, in fact, the l ast German official to turn the town over 

to the Poles. He was then reassigned to 
Hannover
. And t hat™s how the family came 

to be in 
H annover
. He then Œ 
he married a woman, m y mother, who camefromt he 

Rhineland
, and whose father was also a judge, actually. And t
he y lived 
Œ we lived 
in a house in 
Hannover
, which was one of these typical, I think, four or five story 

attached houses. And we lived on what they call the first floor, but Americans 

would call the second floor. 

 
Interview with Gerhard Weinberg  
 
March 13, 2012

Q: Yeah. 
A: And the other floors were either rented as a whole, or i n a couple i nstances, I 

think divided into two apartments. My father owned the building, and we had a 

teeny garden in the front, and a sli ghtly larger one in the back. And m y Œ I had an 

old Œ still have an older sister, an older brother, and I™m the baby in the family. I 
would sa y that my parents belonged to what one would call a middle class. And as I 
said, the whole ti me that I lived in 
Hannover
 was in this apart ment.  

Q: And when you said that your father served in World War I, could you sa y a bit 

more about his experiences during the war? 

A: My father went in i n 1914, was assigned as a replacement on t he western front, 

and for a ti me was i n the trenches, with a pair of field glasses, to locate where thei r 

shells were fa Œ were landing, from their artillery, to correct  that. He was promoted 
to noncommissioned officer. And when the bat talion commander put hi m in for a 
field commission, the regimental commander t urned it down. As he explained, t hat 

is the regi mental comm ander, this is a Prussian guard reserve regiment, and we 

cannot have a Jewish officer. Subsequently, I believe in 1916, the uni t was 

transferred to the eastern front. And in the fighting before 
Riga
, and what is today 

Latvia
, my father was badly wounded in the arm. And since it was his right arm, he 

could no longer fire a weapon. So that after he recovered, t he y recal led that he had

legal training, and made him the legal officer, the chief legal officer of one of these 
scratch divisions put together for occupation duty in the east. And he spent Œ but he 

was, by this time, promoted, and was what the Germans call a 
Rittmeister
, and that 

would be the equivalent of a captain in the American army. And he served that wa y 

until demobilization in 1918. And then, as I said, instead of going back into the 
judiciary, transferred to the new German nat ional ministry of finance, something 
that 
Germany
 had not had between 1871 and 1919. 
Q: Right. If you t hink of your extended family, were there notewort hy 

personalities? 

A: I suppose the
re weretwo.My grandfather on mother™s
 side was a judge in the 

Rhineland
, and came to be what t he Germans called an 
O berlandesgerichtshof
, 

which would be the equivalent of a associate j udge in the state supreme court in this 
country. And he was not promoted to chief judge, because he would have had to 
convert, and he was not about to do that, when it was offered to him. A slightly 

more distant relative lived not in 
Prussi a
, as my grandfather did, but  in the Grand 
Duchy 
Ol denburg
, which is in northwest  
Germ
any
. And before the first World 
War, he was on the t op court of 
Oldenburg
. And when the chief justice of 
Oldenburg
 died, they discovered t o their horror Œ that is, the grand duke, and the 
minister of justice, that  the next senior judge was a Roman Catholic. And in that 

 
Interview with Gerhard Weinberg  
 
March 13, 2012

part of 
Germany
, which is traditi onally overwhel mingly Protestant, they did not  
think that t hat would work very well. The next  senior judge was a Protestant. But by 
the ti me we™re talking about, 1912, or thereabouts, 
Oldenburg
, because of port and 
industrial development had a subst antial Catholic minority. I don™t know what the 

percentage would be, but I wouldn™t be surprised if it was 10 - 15 percent. And t he 
grand duke, and the mi nister of ju Œ prime mi nister and minister of justice were 
concerned that if the y obviously passed over a Catholic, to appoint a Protestant, this 

Catholic minority woul d be very unhappy. So the y decided to pass over both of 

them. And the last chief justice of the Grand Duchy of 
Oldenburg
 was Jewish. I™ve 
always thought as a historian, that this is an example how people can trap 

themselves into absolute stupidity, because of course, this had nothing to do wit h 

qualifications, poli tics, or anything of that sort. It was just that they couldn™t have a 
Catholic chief justi
ce
, and they couldn™t annoy the Cathol ic minority, by putting in 
the next, so I guess they annoyed t hem all, by arranging to have a Jewish chief 

justice as the last chief justice of the Grand Duchy. 
[technical interruption] 

Q: Can I Œ can I ask you about experiences wi th anti-Semitism? With social anti-

Semitism, and you know, like I mean, pre ™33? Because you™re already touching on 

it, like you know, the very fact that somebody would have to convert to become Œ 

 
Interview with Gerhard Weinberg  
 
March 13, 2012

you know, to take on a position is a Œ of course, you know, point ing to ingrained 
anti-Semiti sm. I mean, the camera is off right now, I would Œ 

A: Oh, I see, oka y. Yeah, well we can talk about Œ I™ll tal k about t hat briefl y. 

Q: Oka y, all right. And was your family observing? Did your family have stron
g 

ties into the Jewish community in 
Hannover
? 
A: My family belonged to the Œ what in 
Germany
 would be called the Reform 
Jewish congregation in 
Hannover
, though by American st andards, I believe these 

would be considered a Conservati ve congregation. And we went on the high 

holidays, occasionally on other ti mes. We cel ebrated Frida y evenings regularly at 

h ome
; 
you know,
 Passover, Chanukah, and other such events, so that  Œ and in ti me 
each of us went to a religious school for some training. So, there was no doubt 

about the affiliation of the family. 
Q: How many Jews lived in 
Hannover 
at  the time, do you know? 
A: 
Hannover
 at the time Œ 
excuse me 
Œ was a city of about half a million, and there 
about 5,500 roughly, just over one percent Jewish community there. 

Q: And did your family have any experience with anti-Semitism before 1933? 

A: Well, what one has t o keep in mind is t hat 
Germany
 from 1871, until 1919, was 
a federal state. On the national level, there were not legal regulations specificall y 

affecting Jews. Bu
t the states that madeup 
Germany
, had regu Œ their own 

 
Interview with Gerhard Weinberg  
 
March 13, 2012

regulations. So that in 
Prussia
, which is where the majori ty of Jews l ived, and 
where m y parents li ved, no Jew could be an officer in the arm y. The y all did their 
mil itary duty, but the y knew ahead of 
time they could 
Œ t here were no such things 
as commissioned Jews. Whereas in 
Bavari a
, the did it differently. There were Jews 
among the Bavarian officer corps. There was also a rule i n 
Prussia
, and I™m talking 
not about discri mi nation now, I™m talking abo ut legally established regulations. 
Jews could not hol d admi nistrative positions. So that when my father grew up, he 

knew he could never be post master of the town where he lived. In the case of m y 

grandfather, in other words, if he was going to be the chief justice, as the king of 

Prussia
 also, and pro Œ 
Germany
 had agreed, being the chief jus Œ of the justices 
meant admi nistrati ve responsibilities, and he declined to convert to C hristianity in 

order to accept that position. We tend to forget  in this countr y that legal disabiliti es 
in 
Euro pe
 lasted very l ong. In 
E ngland
, the last major legal disabiliti es on 
Catholics and Jews don™t disappear until the 1880s. In 
Germa ny
 the last legal 
disabilities end in 1919, because they were on the state level, not t he national level. 
When my father was in the military, it was very clear as Œ as I said, you could not 

be an officer in this one unit, and then later became an officer in a different unit. 

There was also, of course, some discrimination. But since I was not alive and adult 

at the time, I did not reall y run int o those sorts of things until after I became five,

six, seven years old, and was going to school, and noticed what was being done t o 
Jews, and what was discussed at home about t hese things. After the Œ 
Hitler 

became chancellor in 1933, there was, as I said, on the one hand, unti l 1919, legal 

disabilities, I guess you would call them, and t hen, at the same ti me, some 

discri mination.  
Q: What is your Œ what  is your Œ what are your fondest memories of your childh ood 
in 
Germany
?  
A: The fondest memori es, I guess, are associat ed in part with a pet  white mouse t hat 

I greatly enj oyed, and that became t otally tam e. And th-t h Œ what  was also 

important for me was t hat while Jews coul d not go to the swimming pool, I couldn™t 

learn how to swi m. And there were other such restrictions, for reasons that I™ve 

never figured out. There were, at least in those days, no prohibitions on Jews goi ng 
to the zoo. And 
Ha nnov er
 had Œ and still has, to the best of m y knowledge, a very 
large, very nice zoo. And I enjoyed going there and watchi ng the animals, and I 
particularly enjoyed the arrangement the y had, where for a very smal l fee, the kids 

up to a certai n weight Œ weight, could ride on a turtle. And I thought t hat riding on a 

Galapagos 
turtle was really very much a Œ a wonderful thing. Another thing that I 

enjoyed as a kid, was t hat great aunt and uncl e, who lived in the 
Rhi nela nd
, outside 
Essen
, had on their property Œ small estate, I guess you would cal l it, two royal

cranes that walked around. And I suspect  today, because I was their height, the y 
liked to walk around with me. And the idea of walking around wi th t wo cranes that 

wandered around wi th me, I thought was reall y very speci al and very nice. And 

since the y had also a tennis court where the y and guests pla yed tennis, the three of 

us would sometimes walk over there and watch people pla y tenni s. Unfortunately, 
nobody had sense enough to take a picture, but I Œ I just t hought that walking 
around wit h two tall cranes, exactly my height , and not on a leash or anyt hing, but 

that just decided that they would walk around with me, was really very, very 

special. I also very much enjoyed t his grandfather, who by this ti me had retired 

from being a judge. We would go to a woods near 
Dusseldorf
 where the y lived, and 

feed what were essenti ally tame deer. And I t hought that that was very nice. The 

other thing he would do, which was probably not nice for hi m, but for me, was t here 
was a switching yard, where there were those small steam engines that put freight 
trains together. And we™d go puff puff. Well, we were under the bridge that we 

walked on, and we would disappear in the smoke, and then reappear. And that t oo, I 

thought was really great, good fun.  

Q: Wonderful. Well , youtouched already, ab
out the changes that  came with 1933. I 
mean, how did you, as a child, experience the onset of national social ism in 

 
Interview with Gerhard Weinberg  
 
March 13, 2012 
 
 
 
12
 
Germany
? I mean, how and when did Nazi rule begin to i mpact your everyday 
life? 
A: Well, it began to i mpact my everyda y life i n two wa ys when I started school in 

™34. In the school i tself, there were nasty com ments from other kids. In the 

Germany
 
of the ti me, all kids went to gender segregated public schools for four 
years. And while in the first part of that, that is, ™34, ™35, ™36, the t eacher I have 

[indecipherable]
 kind of restrained, I think it would be best to sa y, other kids. It 

was rather unpleasant, and in the l ater years in the grade school, t he kids would beat 

up on me, and I would have to try t o make m y way home by devious ways, bec
ause 

I didn™t want to get beaten up so badly. And I carried with me for the next 10 - 20 

years, a tendency to get  very bad nosebleeds. In 1934, when my father was tossed 

out of his job Œ he had been allowed to keep it, in the local office of the ministry o
f 
finance, because he was front veteran at the first World War. But when President 
Hindenburg
 
died in, I believe it™s August  of ™34, then those people were also 
tossed out. So he normal Œ no longer went  to work, off every morning, and instead 

d-decided to earn hi s li ving by what the Germans 
call a 
dev isen berauter
, a foreign 
exchange advisor, and i n practice what it meant was that because of hi s background, 

he understood the constantly changing regulat ions on what people leaving 

Germany
 could take with them. And so, our living room was converted into his 

 
Interview with Gerhard Weinberg  
 
March 13, 2012 
 
 
 
13
 
office, where he met cl ients. And the front hal l, where you came i nto the apartment, 
became a wai ting room. In other words, peopl e would wait there, and then see m y 

father. So the apart ment changed in a wa y, and Dad did this Œ that is t o sa y, did this 

kind of work from 1934 until m y parents left 
Germany
 in the spring of ™39. And 
the fact that we didn™t have a living room any more, and t he front hal l wasn™t 
available, in a sense, certainly made a change in life. But the main change wa Œ I 
would sa y, a sense of Œ that the country di dn™t want you there, and that other kids 

were very unfriendly Œ with a few exceptions, not all. And m y brother, a year and a 
half older, found this an impossi ble situation. My parents took him out of school, 

sent hi m t o live with a family in 
Berlin
, and he went to school there. So that during 
the school year, m y brother was not at home. He was, as I said, li ving in 
Berli n
. 

Evidently, from what I gathered from m y sister, she did not hav
e 
Œ I mean, not that 
everybody was friendly with her, but she didn™t have that kind of situation. It got  

substantial ly worse after a couple of years, because we were told that the teacher 

that Œ whom I mentioned, was ill, and retired. My parents told me many years later 

that he had been a Quaker, and had been fired. And so, we got another teacher, who 

did not restrain the kids. So that was Œ  

Q: Which 
Œ  which grade was this? Were you third grade, fourth grade? 

 
Interview with Gerhard Weinberg  
 
March 13, 2012 
 
 
 
14
 
A: This was the third and fourth grade. And then, m y parents were tal king about 
leaving the country. And first thought that  the y would li Œ stay out thei r lives in 

Germany
, but th Œ there was no future for the three of us. We had relatives in this 
country, and the y appli ed for quota numbers t o come to this country, and in fact 

sent us to start learning English. There were t wo elderly ladies, sisters, who lived in 
Hannover
, who were from 
Engl and
, and we went Œ start ed to learn English from 
them. Though I have to admit that I was probably more intrigued by t heir parrot 
than th Œ by their English lessons. And then in the Œ after the four years, in the 

Germany
 of the ti me, you went t o Œ either you sta yed, or you went t o what was 
essentially a university preparatory system, a gymnasium, and I moved to that. And 

there we started English. And so I learned a lit tle English there. B ut of course, then 

in November ™38, I was kicked out. But I start ed learning English more 
systematically in school in 1938. 
Q: Yeah. And did t he behavior of your neighbors change in any wa y? People who 

also lived i n your house? Anything you remember there? 

A: 
[coughing]
 Excuse me. Well, if it did, I was not aware of it. The Œ for reasons 

that I honestly don™t know, the people who lived in the house above us and below 

us, si mply had very litt le contact with each ot her in those years. They al l Œ 

everybody lived their own lives, in a sense. And so if they behaved differentl y 

 
Interview with Gerhard Weinberg

towards my parents,or us
 afterwards, I didn™t notice it. And we had had, of course, 
some friends and acquaintances, m y parents did in town, but if that changed, I 

frankl y don™t know. 

Q: The synagogue i n 
Hannover
 was attacked very early on, already in March 1933 

was the first attack on t he synagogue. Was 
Hannover 
a particularly anti-Semitic 
town?  

A: I™m incl ined, frankl y, t o doubt that, because whatever happened in this inci dent 

in 1933, when I was knowingly going there wi th some regularity with m y parents, 

there were no incidents until 1938. So that in the period in between, t here weren™t, 

to my knowledge, problems and I think it unli kely that 
Ha nno ver
 was in any way, 
substantial ly different from other cities of some size in the 
Germany
 of the time. 
Q: And what happened to your father during 
Kristallnacht
, 1938? 
A: In November ™38, as soon as things started going wil d, the folks i n 
Berlin
 put 
m y brother on a train and sent hi m back t o 
Hannover
. I continued to go to school. 

On the 10
th
 or 11
th
 of November, I was stil l during the da y in school at this point, 
m y brother was at home, and my sister was also still in school, t he p
olice came. So 

when I came home from school, Dad was gone. The police had come to the 

apartment, whereas I said, my father worked at  home, so he would be home during 

the da y, and took hi m t o the local police lockup. The y clearly were operating from a 

 
Interview with Gerhard Weinberg  
 
March 13, 2012 
 
 
 
16
 
list that had been prepared long before, because the man who opened the door for 
them, who together with his wife and boy, lived with us, was Jewish and was not 

picked up. And the y asked, as I was told when I got home, for a man who lived i n 

the upstairs apart ment, who had di ed months before, but who was still  on their list. 

The y took hi m to the local police lockup. And the one thing I recall, and the other I 
learned later Œ the thi ng I recall was that Mother called the three of us together, and 
asked us if we had any cash, and if we had any unused postage stamps, because the 

government  had frozen all accounts, and she might have to buy some groceries, or 

some stamps to write letters. The ot her thing I only learned later. Dad came home 

after something like three days, and I learned t hat what had happened was, that 

Mother had gone to his former boss, the finance president Œ that i s, the head of the 

finance office, who had originally, back in the 20s, been very upset when a Jewish 
official was assigned to his office, who would have nothing to do wit h m y parents 
socially, until Dad was kicked out. Then he cal led on m y parents. One didn™t treat 

people that wa y. So in ™38, four years la Œ 
four yearsand some mont hslater, my 

mother went to see him. And he called the head of the police and t old hi m to let the 

Œ Dr. 
Wei nberg 
out. And when the finance president calls the pol i Œ 

[indecipherable]
 presi dent, something happens. And so Dad got home. We learned, 

however, that his t win brother Œ he had one t win brother and no other siblings Œ was 

 
Interview with Gerhard Weinberg  
 
March 13, 2012

arrested and sent to a concentration camp. A couple of other, more di stant relatives 
also were arrested and put in concentration camps. But as I said, Dad was let out  of 

the local police lockup, before those people were sent from there t o a nearby 

concentrationcamp. And many, many, many years later, whenIwas workinginthe 

captured German records in 
Alexandria
, one of the soldiers there came by to see 
me one day and said, 
G erhard
, di dn™t you live in 
Hannover
? And I said yes, I di d. 
He said, well here are t he November ™38 records on 
Hannover
. A
nd there was the 

arrest list, with my father™s name on it. But, as I said, he was very fortunate in thi s 

regard, that a man who didn™t like hi m, and didn™t want him in hi s office, still would 

get him sprung from this. And that meant that he di Œ was not sent to a 

concentration camp. 

Q: Do you know which camp your uncle was t aken to?  
A: H-He was taken to 
Buchenwa ld
. 
Q: Did he ever talk about that time? 
A: He was there for several months, and then, under circumstances simil ar to ours, 

went to 
England
 with his wife and kids. And when I si Œ  was back in 
Euro pe 
for Œ 

for the first time again in ™62, I asked hi m not about there, but I Œ he was in the 

arm y, of course, in the first World War, and he was at the Battle of 
Verdun
, in 
1916 on the western front. And I asked him Œ by this time I™m an associate 

 
Interview with Gerhard Weinberg  
 
March 13, 2012

professor of history Œ if he would t alk to me about 
Verdun
. And he said no, 
Gerhard
, I won™t talk about that. And the next ti me I™m in 
London
, he has died in 
the meanti me. He never really recovered fully from his months in 
the concentration 

camp, and I asked my aunt, his wi dow, an d I Œ had he ever talked about 
Verdun
? 
And she said no. And I asked her, well, did you ever ask hi m? And she said yes, but 
there were two parts of his life he would never talk to me about; his ti me at 
Verdun
, and his months in 
Buchenwald
. So he would never Œ I Œ I never had the 

nerve to ask hi m about that, but I t hought ma ybe by 1962, he would t alk about 

1916. But that was something he would never t alk about, and he was never quite the 

same after he was released around March, or t hereabouts
, o
-of 1939. 

Q: You mentioned already a little bit, the preparations for emigration. How did the 

decision to emigrate take shape in your family? When did your farent s Œ parents 
first consider it? Who first had the idea, or saw most clearly what had to be done? 
A: Well, I t hink it came in a Œ if you will, in t wo stages. I cannot give you the exact 

dates, but they start ed talking about this. And i n 19- fi Œ ™35 - ™36, and they were 

talking pri marily about  the three of us, that is m y sister, brother and m yself, on the 

assumption that there was no future for us in the country. And then, not much l ater, 

they began to realize that ma ybe the y should go. And by that time, some other 

members of th Œ our family, were Œ either had left, or were in the process of getting

ready to leave. And a critical element in thi s were two individuals; a great-uncle of 
m y mother™s, who had come to the 
United States
 around the turn of the century, 

had married and lived in Œ in this coun Œ in the 
United States
, was a brilliant 

met allurgical engineer, made a fortune on his patents. And used Œ saved it 

apparently, during t he great depression, and used a lot of this mone y to help 
members of his family;  brothers, sisters, cousi ns, all come a Œ 
[indeci pherable]
.  In 
the 1920s, the older brother of my mother all decided to l eave 
Germany
, and also 
came to thi s coun Œ  the 
United States
, married here, and also then would play a part 
in helping people t o get  out. So, what it meant really, was that we had Œ 
I mean, 

their families and so on and so forth, that we had family in this country, family is 

also whom family members in 
G erma ny
 had occasionally visited, as people once in 
a while did, not as often as the y do now flying, but in those days by boat, and once 
in a while visited, so that the idea of another country where there was family, 
seemed a lit tle bit more plausible, I think it would be fair to say. And so when m y 

parents applied for what in those days were quota numbers, to come t o this country, 

and as I said, started us on English lessons, on the assumption that this is the 

country we would Œ the three of us would eventually grow up in, and this all then 

obviously changed in t he more dramatic and urgent wa y, after November 1938.

Q: How™s Œ how Œ can you sa y something about the process of a Œ obtaining these Œ 
these numbers, and of obtaining a visa? How strenuous was that process? 

A: It was extremely strenuous, because you had to have someone who would 

promise to support you for the rest of your life, after the German government had 

taken just about everyt hing you had, so you would expect to arrive, essentially, 
financiall y as a pauper in another country, during the Great  Depression, when the 
welfare syst ems of all countries were about as strained as they could be. But 

somebody had to promise and show that t he y could honor the promise, that the y 

would support you for the rest of your life. We were very fortunate t hat Œ that we 

had this great-uncle Œ or ma Œ m y mother™s uncle. And if you didn™t have that, there 

were a few instances, but not in my family, where an organi zation, a char Œ Jewish 

charitable organization might find a wa y of providing what was called an affidavit. 
That is to sa y a commi
t ment. W
e would sa y today, a commit ment is necessary for 
lifetime support, because of course, the people who were coming out, and were 
trying to come to t he 
United States
, like m y parents, and m y aunt and uncle, and so 

on, didn™t know German, and had, in many instances, no training for a readily 

transferrable kind of job into a country where there were millions of jobless 

anyway. And of course m y father™s legal traini ng was irrel evant to the 
United 

States
, because it was, like most euro Œ 
G ermany
 Œ 
like mos
t European continents

had Roman law, not common law basis, so that his doctorate was nice for a title in 
Germany
, but hopelessly useless in the Œ in t he 
United States
. So what it was 
really that you had t o get these affidavits, go through endless amount s o
f 

paperwork, which needless to say, either m y uncle, or m y great-uncle and m y 

parents did, not us kids. And then you had to apply, and eventually you would get a 
number. And a certain proportion of these numbers would be cal led up each year, 
and then you could, in fact, go through the emigration procedure at  the German end, 

and that™s Œ  is how this worked, but it was a very complicated, ti me consuming, 

expensive and chanc y matter. 

Q: When you first went to 
Britain
, when did you depart? 
A: Whathappened was,
 that after the November pogrom, the Brit ish government  

was the only one on earth that changed its i mmi gration rules. It decided that people 
who were waiting to go somewheres else, whet her that was the 
United States
, or 
some other country, could do their waiting in 
England
, if they could be supported 
there without trying to work. In 
England
 then, a batch of Œ a number of people in 

the Œ what t he y call the Friends, we woul d call  the Quakers, went around to what 

the English call public schools and we would call private boarding schools, and 

asked them if they would take Jewish refugee children at reduced rates. And there 

was a school on the south coast in a little town called 
Swanage
, whi ch said, we™ll 

 
Interview with Gerhard Weinberg

take two boys . And there was a school in 
Bournemouth
, which is also on the south 
coast, not so far from t here, which said, we™ll take a girl. So parents t ook the three 
of us, at the end of December 1938, and took us by train to 
Hamburg
, and put us 
on a boat, on an American ship, and that went Œ that stopped at th
e 
Le Havre
 in 
France
, and then 
So uthampto n 
in
 England
, before crossing the 
Atl antic
 to the 
United States
. And needless to sa y, the three of us got off in 
Southampton
. And so 

that™s how we got out. My parents, at that poi nt did not yet have thei r exit permits 

from 
Germany
, but they got them a few months later, and then also came to 
England
, to wait for the ti me when our numbers would come up. But of course, this 
was all in the background of the November pogrom. And the part of that which 

really upset me the most was the burning of the synagogue. I knew that people 

someti mes don™t like other people, and beat up on them, t hrow rocks at them. I 
knew, bec Œ  we tend to forget how much t he first World War dominated thinking in 
the1930s, still.I knew thatpeople k
illed each other in enormous numbers. And 

then somebody had shot and wounded m y father. That people were angry at each 

other and di d terribl e things to each other. But to know Œ and that ™s not nice, but 

that was a part of life. But why would people, mad at God? A synagogue or church 

in 
Germany
 would be called a 
Gottes Haus
, the house of God. And that people 
were so mad at God that they would burn down God™s house. That t o me, as a 10 

 
Interview with Gerhard Weinberg  
 
March 13, 2012 
 
 
 
23
 
year old, that just seemed more puzzling and awful than anything else. How Œ how 
Œ what did they thi nk God had done to them, that the y would burn down the house? 

And I suppose that  was reinforced by the fact t hat, after I was kicked out of school, 

I attended for a few weeks in November, early December of ™38, a Jewish school in 

Hannover
, which was the old Jewish bui lding across the street from where the 
synagogue was. So that each da y, when I went into school, the ruins Œ I passed the 

ruins, let me phrase it that wa y. B ut that was certainly the part of this all that 

seemed even m
ore awful than what they did t o people. How could people get mad 
enough at God to go about deliberately dest roying God™s house? That Œ that just did 

not seem to fit with anyt hing that  I had ever heard, experienced, or thought about. 

Q: When di d you first go back to 
Hannover
, after the war? 
A: I was back there very briefl y, only for a few hours in ™62.  
Q: What di d you do, during those few hours? 
A: Oh, I just kind of looked around, and went back to the street where we had lived, 

and burst out laughing. And I burst out laughi ng because i n these row houses on 

both sides of the street in that block, every bui lding was obviously a postwar 

reconstruction, except t he one we™d lived in. And I™ve often kidded, you see, that 

the British area bombing was much more careful than people have ever been willing 

to believe. The one bui lding they didn™t hit, was the one that we had l ived in. I

didn™t go i n, I wasn™t gonna bother anybody, but I just Œ I just could not help 
cracking up, and standing across t he street, laughing. 

Q: What happened t o your family™s assets; 
[indecipherable]
 furniture, household 
items? Could you bring anything, could the Œ your parents bring anyt hing, or was 

everything confiscated? 
A: No. The rules on this changed steadily during the 
30s andearly 40s.
 
That meant 
that when my parents were leaving in early ™39, it was whatever rules applied then. 

You could take furniture, and m y parents were able to do that. You had them 

packed in what was called a lift, a huge crate that would t hen be shipped. Some of 

our pictures the y could take, but the most valuable one, an 
Ostade
, was confiscated. 
You could take a certain amount of clothing. And other parts of clothing, do not ask 

me why, they coul d not take. Many years later, about a little over a decade ago, I 
was in 
Hannover
 to get a Œ they wanted to give me an honorary degree, and there, 
one of the faculty member that had graduate students studying t he records of the 

local finance office on the persecuti on of Jewish families there. And they 
Xeroxed 
for me the file on m y fami ly, including the records of the number of pieces of 

underwear m y mother had been all owed to take, and not take. Obviously, in 

November, in late ™38 - ™39, folks in 
Germany 
had nothing else t o do but to type up 

lists of clothing items, and pots and pans and whatnot. And as I said, these very 

 
Interview with Gerhard Weinberg  
 
March 13, 2012 
 
 
 
25
 
kind people in 
Hanno ver
 gave me copies of these documents. As to what, under the 
then existing rules, my parents had been all owed to take with them, and things they 
had not. And the part that was in a Œ in it s own weird way, particularly conspicuous 

in this regard was t hat families of the kind of social status that m y parents were in, 

who would have a silver service of knives, forks, spoons and whatnot. And the rule 
at the time was that you could take with you out of what was usually a dozen fish 
forks, and a dozen teaspoons and whatnot , you could take one for each member of 

the family and two for guests. So, since we were five, my parents and the three of 

us, that meant, higher arithmetic, seven. So out of each dozen pieces of silverware, 

quite literally, they took five and kept them, and m y parents were all owed to pack 

up seven. And all of those things were put  int o this huge crate, lit erall y, a Œ a lift. 

That was then shipped, at their expense, from 
Hamburg 
to 
New York
, and m y Œ 
this uncle whom I ment ioned before, my mother™s older brother, paid for storage 

here, until eventually we came to this count ry, and then that was unpacked, and was 

our furniture. 

Q: How long did you st ay in 
Britain
?  

A: We 
Œ we sta yed in 
Britain
 all  of 1939, and until September of 1940. So I was in 
this Œ m y brother and I were in this boardi ng school all of ™39, and then in the 

summer of 1940, our quota numbers came up. So in July, we went to 
London
.  

 
Interview with Gerhard Weinberg

Q: And how was your l ife at the boarding school? 
A: That was a Œ that was a wa Œ literally wonderful experience. It™s t here that, 

obviously m y English i mproved i mmensely quickly, since nobody there spoke a 

word of German. We not only learned English, but we had to start learning French 

and Latin. And to t he amusement of fellow students at lunch or di nnertime, I would 
occasionally ask for the Œ somethi ng in t he wrong language. But the kids were 
friendl y and nice. The headmaster was great , who taught  some classes. The two 

teachers Œ ot her teachers were very good. And that™s when, at the ripe age of 11, I 

decided that that™s what I™m gonna do. I decided I was going to be a teacher, and 

never changed m y mind. It was a very, very good experience, and m y brother and I, 

although t he only Jewi sh kids in the school, were not as extraordinary as might have 

seemed, because what we forget is that in those days, when there was still a British 
empire, families around the empire would send their kids to 
England
, to one of 
these boarding schools. So in the scho
ol where 
Bert
 and I were, there was a Œ 
a 
youngster whose parents were in 
Singapore
. There were two boys whose father 
was, you know, a high government  official in 
Kenya
. There was one boy Œ 
and of 
course, this is all boys, this is all gender segregated Œ one boy whose family was in 
Tangier
. And one boy who was very important in this regard, whose fami ly was in 

India
. And his talk about tigers and elephants and whatnot, was consi derably more 

 
Interview with Gerhard Weinberg  
 
March 13, 2012 
 
 
 
27
 
exotic than anything that had happened to my brother and me. So, the notion of 
someone from elsewhere, let me phrase it that way, was much more a normal part 

of life in a school like this, and I suspect other schools, than one might, at first sight, 

expect. And so, that worked out well. Then, of course, came the defeat  of 
France
. 

And we got to watch some of the Battle of 
Britain
 overhead. And a huge sense, 
obviously these 
Œ there were several  Œ 
Swanage 
had two industries. One was 
summer resort on t he coast, lovely beach. But that was all covered wi th barbed wire 
against a German invasion at that point. And t he other was, there was a ver Œ 

considerable number of these publi c schools, private boarding schools in the area. 

And that obviously, the German air force thought it was an i mportant target, and 

they dropped a huge one into the yard of our school, but fortunately, i t didn™t go off, 

or I wouldn™t be here. So we spent a lot of time in the ai r raid shelter there. And 
then, when in July, it Œ we moved t o 
London
. I lived with an aunt and uncle there, 
and m y brother lived with his grandparent s. That, of course, was t he beginning of 
the blitz. So we got to spend ti me i n an air raid shelter in 
Lo ndon
. 
Q: What was your Œ 
theexperience of your parentsin 
England
?  
A: My parents decided that while t he y were waiting for the quota numbers to come 

up, they would live in 
Bournemouth
, i n an apart ment, so that 
La ura
, m y sister, 
who was by herself obviously, could be with t hem. In May - June of 1940, the 

 
Interview with Gerhard Weinberg  
 
March 13, 2012 
 
 
 
28
 
British government got hysterical about a possible fifth column, and proceeded to 
an internment and dispersal polic y. What t he y did was, i ntern the men over a certain 

age, I believe it was 15 or 16. So my father was interned. My brot her and I were 

not, because we were under the age li mit. And the women about t hat age could not 

live within 50 mil es of the coast. Which meant  that m y mother and sister had to 
leave 
Bournemo uth
, and the y were presumabl y l ess dangerous i n 
Londo n
 than in 
Bournemouth
. Donot ask metoexplain why orhow
. But in any case, they then 
went to live in 
Londo n
, and m y sister, in fact, went to school there for a short ti me. 
And Dad was, as I said, first interned in 
L itchfield
, and t hen sent  to t he 
Isle of 
Man
. And Mother lived in
 London
, and m y sister lived in 
London
, until, in the 
summer of 1940, our quota numbers came up. And then, first the four of us, that is 
the Œ the mother and us three kids, were processed. And then what the British did 
was bring a batch of men, whose families and whose numbers were all lined up, 
brought them to 
L o ndon
 to go through t he procedures. And so, in 
Gl asgow
, from 
which we Œ  where we were to get our ship to the 
United States
, the families were 

reunited, so to speak, when the y got out of the train, and got onto the boat. 

Q: So for how long did your mother not see her husband? 

A: Well, she got to wave to hi m when he was processed in 
London
, cause we went 

to 
Grosveno
r Square
 t o see Œ and that would have been about three, four months. 

 
Interview with Gerhard Weinberg

Q: So you arrived in 
New York
, September 1940, correct? 
A: Yes. 
Q: Yeah. And where di d you first stay? 

A: We first sta yed with this uncle and his wife, m y aunt, and their three children in 

a suburb of 
New York City
. And m y parents had to decide where to live in this 
country. Because the dad had been shot through the arm, he coul d not drive, and 

originally i n 
Hannover
, we had had a car for a while, before Jews were prohibited 
from driving cars, and Mother drove. Which i n those da ys, for the woman to dri ve 

the car was very unusual in 
Germany
. But Dad, because of his bad right arm, 
couldn™t. The y then borrowed Œ the family then lent them a car, and Mother drove a 

little bit around 
New York
 state and nearby areas. And they decided t o settle in 

Albany
,
 New York
, which is about 150 miles north of 
New York City
, so they 
weren™t that far awa y from others i n the family, but the y didn™t want t o live in the 

city, and 
Al ba ny
 had the reputation as having good public schools, which with 
three kids headed for schools, it was, of course, a concern of some importance. So, 

in December of 1940, we moved i nto a rented house in 
Albany
. The lift with the 
furniture, etcetera, was unpacked, and we then lived there, and continued to live 

there and go to school t here. And after some years, my parents moved to another 

house. But  Dad li ved out his life there, and Mother, well she had to be in a special  

 
Interview with Gerhard Weinberg  
 
March 13, 2012

home for a while, li ved out Œ the y lived out their lives in 
Albany
. And my brother 
lives in a suburb of 
Al ba ny
 with his wife today. And it was there that I went to 
school, and then to coll ege. 
Q: Was it an issue among your school mat es that you were a Jewish refugee from 

Germany
, was that  an issue at all, in any wa y? 
A: Not really. The only thing that was Œ t hat my school mates found strange, was 

first in 
Scarsdale
, when I first came to thi s country, and t hen the first  few months in 

Albany
 
was my Englishacc
ent. Because of course, I spoke English with an English 
accent. And that was, i n a way, for m y fellow students, more peculiar, if you will, 

than anything else. And over a peri od of not t hat long ti me, my Engl ish accent 

evaporated, and got replaced by what I guess you would call a standard 
New York
 
t ype of speech. 
Q: Right. Did you see yourself as part of a net work of German-Jewish i mmigrants 
in the 
United States
? 

A: In a small wa y, yes. There were several ot her Jewish refugee families, as the y 

call themsel ves, in the 
Albany 
area, and my parents and we associ ated, or would 
see them. And one of them, in fact, benefited in an ironic way, from what I™ve 

alwa ys thought was the only good thing t hat happened in November ™38. And that 

is, my family had i nsist ed that I take violin lessons. And those ended in November 

 
Interview with Gerhard Weinberg  
 
March 13, 2012 
 
 
 
31
 
™38, and that™s just as well, because as you must know, in this country there is a 
constitutional bar on cruel and unusual punishment. And I would not want anybody 

to have to listen to me playing a violin. When the lift was packed i n 
Hannover 
in 
™39, m y parents, for reasons I don™t understand, packed the violin. And it turned out 

that one of the refugee families in the 
Albany 
area had a daughter who wanted to 
play the violin, but they couldn™t afford one. And with considerable pleasure on my 
part, my parents gave them the violin. But that was, if you will, in the Œ in the 

family area. And what also happened was after the war, when the German 

government  began to Œ west German government began to pass restitution laws, m y 

father, who had, at one time helped people find out what the y could take out of the 

country, now provi ded free advice for Œ to people on 
a 
Œ what the y were entitled to 

under these very compl icated rules, that the ordinary refugee family in upstate 
New 
York
 didn™t understand. But given his background and training, this was something 
that Dad understood very well, so he woul d help, without  charging them Œ people in 

the 
Albany 
area and some other nearby towns, on what they were entitled to under 

the restituti on laws, and th Œ especially in the 1950s, early 60s, as refugees. 

Q: Do you remember any other i mmigrant  chi ldren who were Œ 
who were 

classmates or pla ymates? Any names coming up? 

 
Interview with Gerhard Weinberg  
 
March 13, 2012 
 
 
 
32
 
A: N-No. There is the sad part, you see, that my best friend in 
Hannov er
 was the 
son of this couple who lived with us, and he was killed, al ong wit h his parents. 
Horst
. And the only ot her Jewish boy in my class, who was kicked out with me at 

the same ti me, on t he same morning, in November ™38, that was a family that we 

were not in touch with, so I have no idea, frankl y, what happened to hi m, and 
whether he got out, or not. The only person that we sort of kept i n a certain amount 
of contact with was, that the school in 
England
 that I mentioned, they t ook anot her 

Jewish refugee boy, who is now retired as a surgeon, living in 
Santa Monica
, 

California
. And we have sort of kept a litt le bit, and Œ especially my brother, in 
touch with this man, as he left je Œ 
England
 for the 
United States
, grew up, 
married, raised a famil y here, as I said, on the west coast. Now Œ 
but o
-otherwise 

that just simply did not  occur. 
Q: And was there anyt hing that you found curious about life in the 
United States
? 
Anything t hat you felt you had to adjust t o? 

A: Well, obviously, at first I thought the peopl e in this country spoke a very unusual 

form of English, for which I had t o adjust and adapt over a while. I had never eaten 

corn on the cob. In those days, corn in Œ or maize, as they call it in 
Germany
, is 
only used as animal feed. And what we call sweet corn, was in those days, 

completely unknown. And so, when I first was presented with this contraption, of 

 
Interview with Gerhard Weinberg  
 
March 13, 2012 
 
 
 
33
 
which to eat, I must say I was slightly puzzled, until I watched other people in the 
family, who knew how to cope wit h this particular vegetable. And there were a 

couple of other vegetables that were simply knew to us, broccoli for one. But that 

was a little easier to get used to than corn on the cob. It so happened t hat when I 

came to thi s country in September, as I mentioned, in October, of course, came 
Halloween. And we went with the kids of my aunt and uncle, and the idea of going 
around collecting candy was, I thought, a rather unusual habit, but one that I easily 

approved of. The one other thing t hat at first, again, was odd, was that  a couple of 

times, my aunt would come to wake me up in the morning, and di scover, to her 

horror that was lying under the bed. And of course what had happened was that 

during the night, a police car or ambulance had been in the area. I had heard a siren, 

and when you hear a si ren, that means an ai r raid. And I had automat ically gotten 
under the bed. But I got over that, just as I learned to eat corn on t he cob, and qui te 
like it now, I got over being accustomed to hearing a siren not meaning an air raid, 

but mea
ning that there is an ambulance goi ng by, or the police is chasing 
a 
Œ 
a 

traffic violation, o-or whatever. Those things did, I must admit, seem at first a little 

different to me, but they™re not the sort of things that, as a youngster, take very long 

to get used to. 

Q: Were you ever hom esick? Did you have a feeling of Œ of loss? 

 
Interview with Gerhard Weinberg  
 
March 13, 2012 
 
 
 
34
 
A: No. 
Q: 
[indeci pherable]
 had to leave? 
A: No, I really did not. My pet white mouse died just before we left 
Hannover
, and 
the last experiences and the events there were so unpleasant. The way I was kicked 

out of school, you see, was particularly unpleasant. The headmaster came into the 
classroom, read the announcement, and one other boy and I got up, pi cked up our 
things and left. I repressed that memory until I was reminded of it at this ceremony 

when I got my honorary degree, and the two of m y former school mates were there, 

and told me about i t. B ut that Œ that Œ no, I wa Œ there was a certain curiosity, which 

is why, as I told you, in ™62, I Œ I went back, just to see what the place was like. And 

then I was there agai n i n ™83, when I was i n 
Germany
 for quite a whi le, and I have 
since been back there t o lecture and received an honorary degree. But there was 
never any sense that this was a place that I had lost. After all, the y had 
kicked me 
out, rather emphatically. And so there was never a Œ 
a 
Œ a-any sense of an Œ at home 

was 
Albany
, and remained that. 
Q: Well, and Œ do you remember where you were on December 7
th
, 1941?
 
A: Yes. I had made very good friends wit h a l ocal boy who was i n school with me 

in junior high school in the ninth grade, and Œ and was in the same hi gh school, 

Ji mmy Lawson

Metropolit an opera whi le pla ying chess. And on December 7
th
 Œ we took turns 
at his 
house and our house. We were at his house playi ng chess, listening t o the 
Metropolit an Opera, when that was interrupted with the announcement that the 

country was at war. So that was a Œ a somewhat dramatic event that I remember 

rather clearly. The ot her side of this was, you see, that when we came to this 
country in September 1940, the striking thing was coming from a country all 
blacked out, to one where the Œ 
the y were 
Œ everything was lit up. C ause the shi p 
stayed in the outsi de part of 
New York 
harbor overnight, before pulli ng in to the 

pier. And we hadn't seen a city wit h lights for quite a whi le. A year and nine 

months. 

Q: Yeah. Do you need a break?  

A: No, I™m oka y. 
Q: Oka y, great. Well, let™s Œ let™s move onto warti me then. You were too young to 
serve at the t i me, but you nonethel ess served after the war. You were drafted into 

the 
U
.
S
. Arm y. Do you want to tal k about your experiences, what you did? 

A: Yes, the Œ the rule at the ti me t hat we™re tal king about was that you registered for 

the draft, and were pull ed in when you were 18. Well, which went that m y older 

brother, of course, was already in, a year and a half older. When I got to be 18, and 

was drafted, and took m y basic training i n what was then called Camp 
Polk
, and

now Fort 
Polk 
in
 Louisiana
. Then, after that, when was Œ had a few days at home 
before going to Camp 
Sto neman
 which is in 
California
, near 
Oa kla nd
 
Army base. 
I was then shipped to 
Japan
. In 
Japan
 I first spent some months assigned to depot 
supply of the fourth replacement depot. And by being one of two people in 
emergenc y supply, things that they needed, or had to get rid of, it meant being the 
G
.
I
. on truck convoys, otherwise driven and manned by veterans of the Imperial 
Japanese Arm y working for the Americans, ei ther picking up or delivering things, 

and that got me a Œ a good look at the cent ral part of 
Honshu
, t he largest of the 

Japanese home islands. And I was very int erested in that. I™d taken a course in 

Japanese hi story in coll ege before I was drafted. And in the process of doing this, 

discovered that in 
Yokohama
, where headquarters Eighth Army was, the 
occupation arm y, there was a school for the soldiers. And I, one day, had the truck 
convoy stop outside the school, and went in and talked t o the admini strator, and this 
[i
ndecipherable]
 lady. I had worked it out  so that by the time I was drafted, I had 
three years of teachers™ college behind me. And I asked, did the y need any teachers? 

And she said, oh yeah, we certainly do, because the y™re being rotated home. I™ll 

take you
 to see the head of the school, Major 
Dwight
. Major 
Dwight
 was very 
interested i n ha Œ getting me, but explained that he could not order a transfer, that I 

would have to ask the maj or in charge of suppl y at the fourth replacement depot if

he would let me go. And I asked, and the major said yes. So the rest of the time that 
I was in 
Japan
, i n the arm y of occupation, I was in information and education 

section of headquart ers Eighth Army;  teaching

 in the

Corps, teaching Ameri can government, teachi ng American history, and then after a 

couple months, I™m also teaching some literacy cl asses for

I
.
s
 who needed to 
learn how to read and write. And then in ™47, when the American army decided to 
get rid of its draftees, t hat is, unti l the Korean war. Nobody knew the Korean war 

was coming, but what I meant is t hat in that period of time, they had enough regular 

arm y people, so I was discharged honorably, having in the meant ime acquired two 

stripes in t he army, and went back to college. 

Q: Where
 di d you go t o college? 

A: Since, as I ment ioned before, I wanted to be a teacher, I was very fortunate that 
m y parents picked 
Albany
, in which there was what was then cal led 
New York 
State College for Teachers, 
Albany
, now the State University of 
New York
 at 
Albany
. And I enrolled there, on the assumpti on that I was going to t each high 
school social studi es and Latin. And I took classes there, and because Œ this is, the 
war is on, I started there in January of ™44. And just as the y had had i n the high 

school, a program where you could do your senior year in half a year, which I had 

done, accelerated, so that young men could get  as much in before the y had to go i n

the arm y, as possible. They also had an acceleration program in t he college, where 
you could take 10 hours in the summer, and 18 each semester, credit hours. And 

that™s what I did. So I had, with this combination, living at home, goi ng to college 

there, and various part time jobs, to help the family and m yself. So that when I was 

drafted, I had, as I said, three years of college. When I Œ 
during my ti me inthe 
school in 
Yokohama
, the army had a program  where you could take certain classes. 
And I did that, and I got six hours credit when I came out of the arm y, and went 
back in ™47, in the summer, and in the fall. So that although my diploma didn™t 

come til June of ™48, in fact, I finished my four years in January, t ook a semester 

and a summer sessi on in 
Albany
, and then went to the University of 
Chicago
 for 
graduate work, because by this ti me, the 
G
.
I
. bill led me t o think of the possibili ty, 
not of teaching secondary school, as I had ori ginally planned, and I had done m y 
practice teaching in t he ninth grade, but the possibility of getting a 
PhD
 and going 
into college teaching. And for that, I went  to 
Chicago
.  
Q: Right, and you earned your 
PhD
 in 1951, your doctoral advisor was 
Hans 

Rothfels
. Can you tell us a bit more about  your work with 
Rothfels
? Did it matt er 

that you were both immi grants from 
Germany
? 
A: Well, actually, what  happened was, when I went to 
Chicago
, my plan had been 

to work on the diplomatic history of the late 19
th
 century. I was interested in how

the Europeans got t hemselves into the horrors of the first World War, not so much 
the final crisis, but the 1860s, 70s, 80s, 90s, how they got organized i n a way that 

led them to disaster. And so I wrote m y first semi nar paper on the cri sis of a Œ 

eastern crisi s of 1876. But I discovered very quickly in working with ro Œ listeni ng 

to 
Rothfel s 
in the classroom, and working wit h hi m, that  his views of this 
[indecipherable]
 were the opposit e of mi ne. Since I could not afford to change 
universities, I changed centuries, and worked with hi m on 20
th
 
century diplomac y, 
rather than 19
th
 century. And out of that came not only m y shift to 20
th
 century, but 
a very important development that would affect m y life thereafter, into today, in a 

rather unexpected way. When I wrote a seminar paper for 
Rothfel s
, i t was not on 

1876, it was on the May C risis in German and Czech relati ons of 1938. And at t he 

time that we™re talking about, 1949 - 50, the first volumes of the documents on 
German foreign pol icy were coming out. These were edited volumes of captured 
German diplomatic documents. And in the volume that dealt with the Ma y Crisis of 

1938, they had inserted not only German foreign ministry documents, but a number 

of military documents, concerning i nvasion pl ans and so on, so forth. And, because 

I was working on my Master™s thesis already, and had decided to do them on 

German
-Soviet relations in the nonaggression pact, ™39 to ™41, I was unpacking t he 
huge collection of 
Nuremberg 
documents that the law li brary at 
Chi cago 
had 

 
Interview with Gerhard Weinberg  
 
March 13, 2012

acquired, and which is now the big collection of the center for research libraries in 
Chicago
. I discovered very quickly, that at least in m y opinion, the people in one 

hall in 
England
, who were putting these volumes together were making mistakes 

with the military documents. And in the footnotes to my seminar paper, at the 

appropriate points, mentionedthese. 
Rothfels
, after returning the semi nar paper to 
me, called me into his office, and said that I should pull these all  together and look 

for any others, and prepare a critical note on these volumes for the ﬁ
Journal of 
Modern History
,ﬂ one of the professional journals in the field, that is edited in and 
produced by the history department at 
Chicago
. Needless to sa y, I did what 

Rothfels
 had told me t o do, and wrote, and then the ﬁ
Journal of Modern History
ﬂ 
published i n March of ™51, a critical  note on the documents on German foreign 

policy. At the ti me, as I was going towards the finishing of m y 
PhD
 
dissertation on 
the subject of German-Soviet relations, academic jobs in this country were 

practically nonexistent, because faculties everywhere were shrinki ng. This was the 

only ti me i n modern American history when enroll ments were dropping and 

dropping quite drasticall y in higher educati on, as the 
G
.
I
.
s 
were finishing their 
education. But I got a call Œ and so the universit y had no leads, or I had no leads 

whatsoever for any job, until I got  a letter from a Dr. 
Fritz Epstei n
, who was 
recruiting for a documents project in the German archives, and who had seen this

critical note. I did not know at the ti me, that he was, in fact, one of the people that I 
was criticizing. But he read that, and he wrote to me and explained that he was 

recruiting st aff for a documents program. He was fl ying to the west coast. Woul d I 

meet h i m at  
Midway
 airport, between planes, and we™d talk? Needless to sa y, I was 
very interested in meeting hi m at 
Midway 
airport, which under the circumstances 
seemed appropriate, si nce it™s named for one of the critical battles of the second 

World War. Andhe andI 
started talking. And he was so interested, and I was so 
fascinated, that he decided to take a later plane than the one he was booked for. We 

spent hour Œ literally several hours just sit ting, talking about document s and about  

the new edition which had just come out, by the do Œ of the 
Hitler 
table talk, and on 

all kinds of things. And we got through lat er, I got an offer of a job on the war 

documentat ion project. Needless to sa y, I accepted, and after defendi ng the 
dissertation in August of ™51, moved to 
Alexandria
, where the records were. But it 
was essenti ally the suggestion that 
Rothfels
 had made, for me to do t his, that got 

me into
 the Œ that j ob i n the first place. The onl y other interesting contact that I had 

was, that he was the only faculty member in my t hree years at 
Chicago
, who at one 

point had a group of us, m yself included, graduate student s, at his house, at his 

place. And all Œ at t hat Œ on that occasion, his wife told me what had happened to 

hi m in November of 1938. He was Œ he Œ t he Œ  both 
Rothfels
 and his wife were

very devout Lutherans, but the family background was Jewish. The y came to collect 
hi m in November ™38, and his wife explai ned that he was in bed. He™d lost a leg in 

November in 1914 on the western front, and his prosthesis was being repaired. And 

the me
n who came to pick hi m up said, well, we™ll be back in half an hour Œ thi s is 

what she Œ what she tol d me, with a stretcher, and the y di d come back half an hour 
later with a stretcher, and took hi m to the local police lock up. And the sergeant i
n 
charge had been in 
Rothfels 
company in November 1914, and told the two men t o 

take hi m out the back and take hi m home. Soon thereafter he moved to 
England
, 
and ended up in the same internment camp as m y father. Came from there then to 

Brown
 University for a short ti me, and from t here to 
Chi cago
. So, that was the one 
time I was at their apartment in 
Chicago
, and his wife told me this st ory about his 

rather unusual deliverance in November of 1938. I was his research assistant for a 
quarter. Uni versity of 
Chicago
, at least t hen, was on a quarter system, not a 
semester system. And he was then beginning to go back to 
Germany
 semesters at a 
time, to 
Tübing en
. So actually when I finished the 
PhD
, he was not t here, but I 
was, in effect, his last American 
PhD
. And hi s classroom presence was in certain 
ways v ery 
Œ I think very influential for me, because he analyzed the students, and 
got student s to look at ways which were unconventional in a wa y, compared to most 

of the textbooks, and the Œ I found that very challenging, and very interesting. And

perhaps that helped me a little bit later on when I was doing the teaching. And we 
stayed in touch, and I did go see hi m once in 
Germany
 before he di ed, in the 70s. 
Q: Was he ever happy at 
Chicago
? Was he ever happy in the 
U
.
S
.? I mean, he did 
go back to a regular position. 
[indecipherable]
 

A: It Œ it™s very hard for me to say, because he was not the kind of person to share 
his views and attit udes. I have no doubt that he was very pleased to have a decent 
job, in a first rate university. I did not have the impression that he and the other 

members of the history depart ment were on very close terms. But , he continued t o 

have at least a mini mal  tie to 
Chi cago
 afterwards, and so Œ and he certainly had a 

succession of graduate students there, of whom I was chronologically t he last, but 

certainly not the only one. And at l east m y predecessor in this situation 
Phil
 

Wolfson
, also pla yed a larger role, and I a very minor rol e in the research that he 
did on the German opposition to 
Hitler
, on which he produced the first i mportant 
book. 
Q: Well,let™s moveont o your early career.You mentionedalready the 
war 
documentat ion project that 
Epstei n
 recruited you for. Could you explain what that 

was, and what that work entailed? 

A: The American air force, and offi Œ 
Human Resources Research Instituteat 

Maxwell 
Air Force Base in 
Alabama
, have made a contract  with t he Bureau for 

 
Interview with Gerhard Weinberg  
 
March 13, 2012

Applied Social Research of 
Columbia 
University, to do some explori ng in the 
captured German records that had been brought to this country. My work on this 

was physically located, if you will, in the old t orpedo factory in 
Al exandria
. This is 

a set of buildings 
crea 
Œ built in t he first World War, for the maki ng of mines and 
torpedoes t hat coul d be loaded directly ont o ships on the 
Potomac 
Ri ver. In the 
second World War, it was the place where t he American arm y deposited its World 

War II records, temporarily at least . And a portion of this was cal led t he German 

Military Document Section, 
GMDS
, where the captured German records were. To 

begin with, I was asked to do something slightly different, actually, than research in 

those records. At the ti me we™re talking about now, ™51 - ™52 and thereafter, the 

captured records in American government custody, were al l secured and classified. 

And we had to have a clearance to work there, in the buil ding. But there were 
already substantial numbers of German captured records t hat one way or another, 
had ended up in all kinds of places in the 
United States
. And in order to have some 
sense of what was going on, it seemed i mportant to get some idea of what was 

where. And so, m y first  job really, was prepari ng what came to be my first book, the 

ﬁ
Guide to Capture
d Germa n D
ocuments
.ﬂ Which was partly inventory, partly 
book listing of captured German records that had ended up in the Li brary of 

Congress, in the National Archives, in the Insti tute for Jewish Affairs in 
New York

City
, in depositori es el sewheres in the 
United States
. And in fact that also meant 
that in the Library of Congress, where there was lots in the manuscript division, I 
was the one who got to organize these, and set  them up, and try to organize th
em.  

Thereafter, like the others, for the most part on the War Documentation Project, 

were on what was called, Project 
Alexander
. And Project 
Alexander 
was the very 
secret cover name for our research into Soviet partisans in World War II. There was 

an advisory committee on this, for this project, headed by 
Phil Mosel ey
, Professor 
Phil Moseley
 of 
Harvard
 University. And what we were asked to do by the air 
force for them, obvi ousl y, the y were paying for this, through 
Columbia
,if you will, 

on a contract  basis, was the Œ what Œ what  was actually going on in t he German 

occupied portions of the 
Soviet Union
 where t here were all these guerillas? And the 

general Œ the decision as we worked on this was, using the German records that 
were in 
Alexandri a
, we decided to have two kinds of studies; topical and regional. I 
got to do the topical study, on the role of air power in partisan warfare. Needless to 

say, our air force was very interested in that st udy on how the Soviets used air 

power in support of partisan warfare, and how the Germans used air power in 

fighting partisan warfare. And I found that very interesting in studying the relevant 

records, insofar as the y were available. And many, many, many, many we Œ decades 

later, in 2005, noticed when I was in 
Minsk
, t he capital of 
Belarus
, and their

outdoor museum, Worl d War II museum, t he y had what t he y call a decoder. A 
DC3
, one of the many t hat we had provi Œ the 
United States
 provided to the 
Russians under
 
[indeci phera ble]
 and whi ch was the key airplane in Soviet support 
of partisan warfare, for fl ying in supplies, fl yi ng out wounded, bringi ng in officers 

and so on, so forth. But  they had one of these American planes that I had written 
about, on displa y for me to look at  in the origi nal. The regi onal study that I was to 
make, was of the 
Yelnya-Dorogobuzh
 area in the 
Smol ensk Oblast
. And that 
proved very interest ing, because it™s really about the only anti-part isan campaign 

the Germans ever had in World War II that was, from thei r point of view, 

successful, as opposed to all the ot her anti-part isan campaigns that  m y colleagues 

worked on, 
Bryansk
, o -on other parts of 
Belarus
, on the 
Ukrai ne
, on the 
Caucasus
, and so on. And then we had specialized on psychological warfare, and 
partisan warfare and so on. And t hen these studies were published in classified form 
originally, by the ai r force, after they published m y guide to captured German 

documents. And t hen t hey were declassified. And then one of the scholars who 

worked there, on the war document ation project, the Œ 
John Armstrong
, who made 

his career in the Uni versity of 
Wisconsi n
 in 
Madison
, sort of edited t hem into one 
big book. And the other project that I then did, was to publish in English, captured 

partisan documents that the Germans had either seized from groups, or picked up 

 
Interview with Gerhard Weinberg

from dead partisans. And I published th Œ I mean, the air force published a big book 
of mine, ﬁ
Selected Soviet Documents on the Partisan Movement
.ﬂ I also did a 

collection of Soviet  partisan diaries that the Germans had seized. But for reasons 

which I don™t understand, the air force never published t hat. So that exists, this 

collection of diaries exists, if it does anywhere, only in unpublished form. When 
Professor 
Armstrong
 published t his big book that 
Wisconsin
 published, ﬁ
Soviet
 
Partisans in World War II
,ﬂ he added a number of these specialized studies, hi s 
own surve y of the whol e partisan movement and very substantial  port ions of m y 

book of selected Soviet  sources, but no part is m y ri Œ remember, of the unpublished 

collection of partisan diaries. Before I left the project in ™54, there were also Œ they 

were beginning to assi gn us some other speci alized studies in thi s field. While I was 

working on the Soviet sources on the partisan movement, one of my colleagues, 
Eric Waldman
, was doing one on th
e 
Germany
 Œ German locally recruited poli ce, 
the 
Ordnungspolizei
, and another member, 
Alexander 
Dallin
, was doing a study 
which was published, on the Romanian occupi ed portion of the 
Soviet
 
Union
. That 
is to sa y, after the Germans and Romanians i nvaded 
Russia 
in ™41, t he Germans 
turned over to the Romanian government, a substantial portion of the 
Ukraine
 t o 
administer. 
Transnistria
, it was called. And 
Dallin
 was assigned to do a study of

what happened in t his. And there were probabl y others, but by t hat ti me, I had left 
the project. 

Q: Which other historians, or later historians did you meet at the war documentation 

project? You menti oned already 
Dallin
, you mentioned 
Armstrong
. 

A: Oka y, I mentioned 
Eric Œ Eric Waldman
, whose later career was in 
Ca nada
. 
Willie Mol l
, whose lat er career was in this country. Very i mport ant was 
Raul 

Hilberg
, who at that point in time, unlike the rest of us, had not yet finished his 

PhD
 dissertation, but did so, in effect, at 
Columbia
, while worki ng i n part Œ full 
time with us in the war documentation proj ect, and who subsequently went on to a 

career most of his life at verm Œ 
University of 
Vermont
. Another personwas 
Earl 
Ziemke
, who went  from t he war documentation project, a year or two after I did, to 

the office of the chief of military history, and published a number of very i mport ant 
books while there. And then moved to the Uni versity of 
Georgia
, in 
Athens
,
 
Georgia
, and published some more i mportant books from there. There were a 
couple others who did not Œ I mean, who went  on with their lives and careers, but 

did not pla y that import ant and professional role, as 
Ziemke
 and 
Armstrong
 and 
Hilberg
 di d.

Q: And Œ and when you describe about the atmosphere t here, in t he t orpedo factory, 
I mean how was it l ike to be the first to see these documents? I mean, how did you 

feel about that? 

A: Well, it was very interesting. You got a sense of discovery that you couldn™t get 

elsewhere, because while obviously some intelligence specialists and other had 
pawed through some of this stuff, mo-
mo
st of it you were l ooking at for the first 
time, and Œ  and that  could really be quite excit ing and interesting. I never forget we 
sta Œ for reasons I cannot now tell  you, we Œ 
we 
Œ one of the collect ions that I was 

set on early, was the 
[speaks German]
, t h
e 
Reichs
 commissioner for strengthening 
Germandom
(ph). And there the y were the files on the individual German military 
leaders, who expected to acquire huge estates in eastern 
Euro p
e
. And I never forget 

the 
[indeci pherable]
 who spent, after he was canned, 
temp 
Œ on Œ in t he winter of 
™41 - ™42, and spent his ti me riding around 
Pol and
, looking for an estate that the 
government  would steal for him before he returned to active duty in t he spring of 

™43. And t he y eventuall y gave hi m one, that is, that the y stole from the Poles, that 

was worth, he thought an inadequate one and a quarter million marks. And he was 

very unhappy that t he y didn™t steal  a bigger one for him. It gave me a kind of 

insight int o the German military of World War II, that I had, I must admit, not had 

up to that point. And the whole business Œ I mean, I discovered later, and Œ when I 

 
Interview with Gerhard Weinberg  
 
March 13, 2012

was working in the federal archiving 
[indecipherable]
 the files on the bribery of all 
of these top officials. But I must sa y, I was somewhat surprised, shall we sa y? And 

it was also interesting t o Œ just to see the differences in local handli ng of things. 

That is to sa y that i t Œ one German division would operate one wa y, and another 

division 20 miles away would operate somewhat differently. That is to sa y the 
extent to which local initiatives and different approaches t o issues, in what people 
refer to as a totalitarian society, but in which t here was more differentiation, if you 

will, at the local level than one might originall y have anticipated. The other thing 

that really hit me was that Œ how the horror invaded everyt hing. The welfare 

organizations end up with corpses that the y don™t know what to do wi th, you know. 

And the party organizations and welfare organizations are deciding whom to let 

starve. The Œ it™s n ot somehow a segregated, carefully compart mental ized portion, 
the evil part , but rat her, it™s sort of pervasi ve. And that, I have to admit, came as 
something of a surprise. The other part of this that was interesting was that one 

could periodically help people, ei-ei ther who were there and who needed help, or 

who came there. I was able to help the ger Œ indirectly, the German scholar with 

whom I was worki ng on a biography of one of the ke y figures of the German 

resistance to

German resi stance cam e to visit t here. A man by the name of 
Gisevius
, whose 
book, ﬁ
To the Bitter End
ﬂ is rather well known. I got t o meet him. And then he 

asked me for help. He wanted to have 
Xerox
 copies o-of those parts of the police 
reports that mentioned hi m. And t he y had expl ained to hi m that t h Œ he couldn™t 

have them. And I went to ask, well what Œ why can™t he have them? And it turned 
out to be very simple. The y could lend and make photocopies for government 
agencies, but they had no wa y of taking money from anybody to buy anyt hing. So 

we arranged for them t o lend them to the photo duplicati on section of the Library of 

Congress, which t hey could do, and the people there could, of course, sell 
Gisevius
 

photocopies of the documents he was interest ed in. And there were other such 

things where one could occasionally assist  somebody o-out of si mply no Œ working 

in this wa Œ what we refer to, since it was not air conditioned in the summer, the 
black hole of 
Calcutta
. Because you™re there on the 
Potomac
, humidi ty i s very 

high, and no air conditi oning. It Œ it was not physically very pleasant, but the arm y 

people were very hel pful, and so it was an intriguing wa y to begi n working in the 

profession. 

Q: Yeah. And after two one year teaching posi tions, you were hired again, to work 

with the captured German records. This was in 1956, and the assignment was t o 

microfilm all Œ captured German records before the y were returned t o 
Germany
.

And this project was under the auspices of the American Historical Association, 
went on for several years. Could you talk about this project, and what your role 

was?  

A: What happened was this: when the Œ t he gove
rnments of 
Œ of the 
United States
 
and 
Great Britain
, and the y each Œ they joi ntl y controlled, and there was a Briti sh 
representative in 
Alexandria
, as t here was an American one in 
Eng land
, decided to 
start sending the records home, under an arrangement of their being American 
records. And if you want, I™ll expl ain how that came to be. But people then became 

scholars in this country, became very alarmed that Œ how could we assure access to 

these records, after they were back in 
Germany
? And a group of scholars operati ng 
privately and independently in 
New York
, got  together and set up a committee for 

the study of war documents. The y got money from the 
Ford 
Foundation. The y had 
a meeting with government officials, in the Li brary of Congress, with 
Verner
 
Clapp
, who was then the deputy librarian of Congress. And I was invited to thi s 
meeting, from 
Kentucky
, where I was then teaching
 [coughs]
 Excuse me. I suspect 
on 
Fritz Epstein™s 
recommendati on. And it was agreed that we would try to film, 
with the army™s agreement, cooperation, as the records were declassified, so that 

there would be this sequence, declassification, microfilming, return to the federal 

republic. The Ameri can Historical Associ ation, and the 
Fo rd 
Foundation agreed 

 
Interview with Gerhard Weinberg  
 
March 13, 2012

that the hand Œ the financial handli ng would be through t he 
AHA
. And then 
subsequent ly, after the 
Ford 
Foundation money ranout 
Œ 
excuse me 
[coug hing]
 
da 
Œ 
Lillian Dowman
(ph) put up mone y for a while. And then, the Old Dominion 
Foundation paid for many years of it. But the money went through the American 

Historical Associat ion, and this independent committee became the committee on 
war documents of the 
AHA
. I was ha Œ 
hired by the 
AHA
 in the technical sense 
then, to be the first director, and had the money to hire one professional, and one 
secretarial assistant. And to pay for one person who was a micro-photographer, but 

who was, i n effect, provided by the National Archives. So, in May of ™56, I moved 

to 
Washington
, and set up this program, and t he policies for it. And han Œ at the 
beginning, very i mportant decisions and influences to consider. I had managed to 

persuade the committee to put the microfilms that we were going to make, into the 
National Archives, not the Library of Congress. And I was persuaded by Œ or 
indoctrinated perhaps i s the best term, by the head of exhibits and publications of 

the National Archives, a man by the name of 
Lysinger
(ph), that it was a mistake to 

film selectively. And I fell in with this very, very quickly, because I had been using, 

in the National Archives, for m y own research, some of the microfilm the State 

Department had deposited there from the forei gn office microfilm. And whatever 

they thought the y were doing in 
[i ndecipherable]
 hall, it  was edi ting, and it alwa ys 

 
Interview with Gerhard Weinberg

meant that the same German file either didn™t get filmed at all, or got filmed in bits 
and pieces on different rolls of microfilm, sometimes as many as six. And then 

eventually, if you want ed to make sure you had everything, you™d have to go to 

Germany
 and look at t he original file, whi ch i n fact I ended up doing. Furthermore, 
as
 
Lysinger
(ph) explained to me that there were two other reasons to film, 
occasionally selectively, but generally throughout, was t hat you spend your money 

on filming, not on selecting, which meant that  you could produce much more. And 

there™s no question that  this helped us sustain t he program, because as Professor
 

Hale
(ph), who was the third head of the comm ittee, but headed it l onger than 

anybody el se, told me t hat if you go to a foundation for microfilm, they™re not much 

interested. But 
if you can tell them that for 30 or 35,000 dollars a year, you can t urn 
a million frames int o the National Archives, they are somewhat more interested. 
The other thing that 
Lysinger
(ph) explained to me, that I was barely conscious of 
from m y earlier work with the 
Nuremberg
 mat erial, was that of course, all 
government s in World War II, used the poorest paper possible, because they wanted 

to use their resources for things which were a lot more important than requisitions 

for paper clips. And therefore, we needed to film, in part  for access, t o be sure, 

which was the origi nal concept of the committee; that American, German, British, 

any other scholars could have acc Œ could be guaranteed access. But t hat we were 

 
Interview with Gerhard Weinberg  
 
March 13, 2012

also filming for preservation. And having seen some of the 
Nuremberg 
mimeographed stuff starting to crumble, I did not take much indoctri nation. But, as 

I said, 
Lysinger
(ph) reall y put these things to me in a way so that  I Œ when I set this 

whole thing up, we did a teeny bit of selective, but mostly fil ming throughout, and 

that then continued thereafter, long after I was out of it on the Œ t eaching in 
Kentucky
 or in 
Michi gan
. But that meant in that Œ that it was afterwards possi ble 
for the army and the project to cooperate. When the arm y 
started putt ing mone y in, 
especially for the filmi ng of the military records, the y would contract with a micor Œ 
with a Œ for the microfilming, and the committ ee™s professional peopl e would do the 

descriptions. So t hat when it was all over, of the material that was at one time in 

Alexandria
, let me put it this way. Somewheres between 90 and 95 percent was 

film. The material t hat was in 
England
, at least 85 percent, and probably 90 percent 
went back to 
Germany
 un-filmed. And I remain convinced of the importance of 
this, and I have to sa y I have become more convinced in recent years, of the 
importance of filming t hroughout, because while lots of people are increasingly 

thinking about what to do about the fact that t he Holocaust survivors are either dead 

or not going to be with us very much longer, the papers, the records of the 

Holocaust era, are di sappearing too. Either physi cally, for the paper, or 

electronically if they™re electronic records. So that in 50 years or a hundred years 

 
Interview with Gerhard Weinberg  
 
March 13, 2012 
 
 
 
56
 
from now, not only will there be no human wi tnesses of those terrible events, any 
paper, or any electronic records wil l be either gone, or inaccessibl e. So on this 

particular side of the issue, I have become, if you will, more convinced of the 

necessity of total reproduction, eit her in microfilm, or in high density engraving on 

plates, than I was when we started. And the ot her policy t hat I insisted on at the 
beginning, and that to the best of m y knowledge was followed for Œ t hrough the rest 
of the project, was t hat where the western allies had not acquired what I would call 

the Œ the top level records Œ and the two examples that I recall very distinctly were 

the German labor front, and the German welfare Œ the Nazi welfare organization. 

As a general polic y, whatever was there shoul d be filmed, so that  people would 

have at least something from lower levels, that  would give them some idea of what 

the Œ the policies and issues were. And later on, when the arm y was beginning to 
run out of money for filming, I urged them, and I believe they followed, on a 
somewhat si milar basis. That is to sa y, all the t op level military records were 

filmed. But when t he y had to choose among t he division records, after a while, I 

told them all the air force field divisions, what ever there is, all the securi
ty 

divisions, whatever there is. Whatever the fiel d training divisions, whatever there is, 

because there you Œ you were again dealing with an i mportant subject, but only 

fragmentary surviving records.

Q: Yet, if you were to summarize, what did the mi crofilmi ng project achieve? What  
does it mean for scholarship, just to get t hat idea across? 

A: Well, it means t hat t here is access, now and into the future, of an enormous 

quantity of German records from t he 1930s and 40s, on essential ly all  aspects of 

events, 
and thatcan be accessedin 
Washi ngton
, that can be accessed elsewheres by 
either purchase or borrowing. And that for one of the most dramatic areas of world 

history, and the largest war ever fought that we know about, and t he horrendous 

catastrophe of the Holocaust, there are records that people who are int erested can 

have access to, essentiall
y toda y, without restrictions,and t
hat the y can make the 
most of. And that there was no opportunity, as there was after the first World War, 

for the postwar German government to restrict access, even if it want ed to. I™m not 

suggesting that wi th certain excepti ons, the German postwar government has 
wanted to, but needless to sa y, in t he 1950s, nobody knew this, and we were 
looking at the past experience, which peopl e had, as opposed to the future 

experience, which for very good reasons, people hadn't  had yet. And t here was one 

other aspect to this that I think is i mportant, and that is, it  created, if you will, a kind 

of precedent. Why keep the records of country 
X
 
cl
osed, if those of country 
Y
 are 
open and accessible? Why not open American records for the period on which t he 

German records are open? So that there is, if you will, a Œ 
a 
Œ a certain impetus, if 

 
Interview with Gerhard Weinberg  
 
March 13, 2012 
 
 
 
58
 
you will, t hat the declassification, and then microfilming of German records has had 
for the opening of other records. There is one final point that™s cl osely related to 

this, I would argue, and that is that those who might have preferred closure of 

German records in post war 
Germany
, realistically didn™t have a ch
ance.
 And the 
dramatic example of this that I would site, is the German scholar 
Derscha
(ph), who 
wanted access to some personnel records of the German foreign mini stry, which 

were denied to hi m. And who then discovered that they were on microfilm in 

Washington
. The Œ the possibilit ies, in other words, and the temptati ons simply 
haven™t been there. And while I don™t want thi s to be read as a general attack, cause 

as I said, the Œ the German government of federal republic was on the whole, very 

cooperative. T
here was never much of a tempt ation to go in anot her direction. 

Q: Yeah. One of your maj or publ ications after the dissertation is related to your 
work with the captured records, you publi shed 
Hitler™s 
second book. Republished it 
in German, with a German publisher in 1961. What is this second book? What is the 

story behind this peculi ar document? 

A: In the 19 later 50s and 60s, I was working on the origi ns of the second World 

War and German foreign polic y. In the process I saw a couple of references to 

Hitler
 havi ng dictat ed another book. I was back teaching, first at 
Kentucky
, then at 
Michigan
. But in the summer of ™58, I went back to assist m y successor as direct or

of the project, Dr. 
Dagmar Perman
, and was going through piles of stuff to 
describe and set up for microfilming and came across this one sheaf, it™s around 300 
pages of t ypescript, which was labeled as a draft, or partial draft of ﬁ
Mein Kampf
.ﬂ 

And when I started reading it, it was perfectly obvious this is no draft of ﬁ
Mein 

Kampf
,ﬂ it™s clear from the opening lines, lit erally, that t his was a second book. Not 
long after, two things happened, which made t he publicati on possible. One was, that 

it turned out that back i n ™45, after this document was confiscated at the Nazi public 

party™s publishing house in 
Munich
 by the Americans, the y had made a microfil m 

of it back in ™45, and provided it to the Bri tish. And under those circumstances, t he 

British representati ve i n 
Alexandria
 allowed me to have a copy made from their 

microfilm, so I could st art working on prepari ng a text for publication. I got subseq 

Œ abou Œ a few months later, a letter from 
Rothfels
, who by this time was associated 
with the Institute for Contemporary History in 
Munich
, that they had heard about 
this book, and he sent me the correspondence, and I wrot e back and told him yes, I 

just found it. And so, it seemed best to publish it in 
Germany
, in the Institute™s 
publication series. And i-it took a while, and t here were problems wit h the Bavarian 

government , which was very hesitant and put a publication run li mit on the print of 

the book. And the, excuse me, Institute had to deal with the 
Hitler
 heirs, to make 
sure there weren™t going to be problems about the rights, which they bought for a

few hundred marks from t hem. And so t hen I put it out in 1961 in German, and it  
took me til  2003 t o get a publisher to put i t out  in English. 

Q: During the 70s and 80s, you were very much known as the specialist on Nazi  

foreign polic y. You published two volumes, ﬁ
The Foreign Policy of Hitler™s 
Germany
,ﬂ and they™re still among the standard works on Œ on t he topic. Why did 
you choose the topic of Nazi foreign polic y at the ti me? 

A: I chose the topic because then, as I might add, still today, there is a new book on 

the origins of Worl d War I every six weeks. B ut there didn™t seem to Œ there doesn™t 

seem to be similar interest in the origins of World War II. And while I have nothing 

against people studying the origins of World War I, having at one time m yself 

thought of doing somet hing on the diplomac y of the late 19
th
 century, that set the 
stage for the first Worl d War, it seemed to me preposterous that nobody had done 
anyt hing si milar, seriously looking at the origins of World War II. I was convinced, 
and I™m must Œ then, when I started on thi s, and remain 
convinced today, thatafter 

the experience of Worl d War I, which was most unpleasant for all concerned, 

winners and losers, there was no one else on t he face of the globe who was going to 

start another World War, than the Germans. It was true, and it happened, that local 

wars would be started by others. A civil war in 
Spa in
. But that was a civil war. The 
Italians were going to revenge their earlier defeat by the people of 
Abyssinia
, and 

 
Interview with Gerhard Weinberg  
 
March 13, 2012

what you really had was the last of the great colonial wars. The Japanese had fought 
one war with 
Chi na
 and one with 
Russi a
, and now would fight another one with 
China
. There was always the possibility of another war in 
South America
 between 
countries that had been at war repeat edly in the 19
th
 century. There was alwa ys the 
possibility of some war between who knows, t he Hungarians and t he Romanians, 
who were always itchi ng to do that, but fortunately didn™t. But starti ng another 
World War, nobody after 1918, ot her than possibly the Germans, were going to do 

that. And so, I figured t hat since nobody el se was doing anything seriously on the 

origins of World War II, the best wa y to do thi s was to organize it  around the place 

where the initiative came from. And while there were people in 
Germany
 in the per 

Œ in the 1920s, who were thinking seriously of the possibility of ma ybe trying to 

take back some of the land the y™d been forced to return to 
Poland
, or Œ o-or who 
knows what else, no one other than 
Hitler
 was thinking of anythi ng bi gger. And so, 
I decided that the way t o organize an origins of World War II book, was around 

German foreign pol icy after 1933. And aster Œ after I had gotten int o i t for a while, 

it became clear to me, and by discussion with a man who was doi ng this from the 

institutional side, whom I got to know, Professor 
[indeci pherable]
 
Jacobson
(ph), 
that I™d best  do thi s in two books, rather than one. Now, t he y are now available in 

 
Interview with Gerhard Weinberg

62
 
one book, but I™m talki ng about when I was doing them, at the time, so out of this 
came the two books on 
Hitler™s 
foreign polic y. 

Q: From our perspective, 2012, do you think that Nazi foreign polic y and 

international diplomacy during the 1930s are topics still  worth exploring, or have 

they run their course? 
A: Well, there is now, i ronically it appeared last year, what literally one other book 
in the field, and thi s was the British historian 
Zara Stei ner
, who had written the 
book, ﬁ
The Triumph of the Dark
,ﬂ which is an European internat ional hist
ory of 
the 30 Œ of the ™33 - ™39 period. And I have a very high opinion of her, and of her 

work, which follows a book she did on t he 1920s. Big book, very big book. But  I 

think that t here ma y well be issues in there that  are still worth looking at. But other 

than her, and as I said, the book just came out last year. People just don™t 
seem 
much interested. They™re interested in the war itself, and the y cont inue, as I s Œ t old 
y 
Œ  mentioned, to t urn out books on the origins of the first World War, another one 
comes out every year. But I do not feel, frankly, t hat I have a copyright on either the 

1930s or the war, and t hat if someone else would like to do this, they are welcome. 

The one caut ion that I would put in there is that the amount of records that is 

available, is very bi g, and you bett er be prepared to spend a lot of ti me. 

 
Interview with Gerhard Weinberg

Q: Yeah. The Œ 
the German 
foreign office itself, as an institution, has recently 
attracted renewed attention. There was a Œ a German historical commission looking 
in to the hi story of the German foreign office during the 1930s, and during the war 

and the Hol ocaust. And the book was publ ished in 2010, called ﬁ
The German 
das 
a mt
(ph).ﬂ Made a bi t of splash in the German press. What do you thi nk of that 
study? 

A: Well, I wa 
Œ I have t he book and I™ve read i t, but it™s a very int eresting and I 
know at least a few of the people who™ve been involved i n prepari ng it. I think it ™s 

quite thoughtful, but it does not, i n m y judgment dig sufficientl y carefully into some 

of the people invol ved, and their act ions. 
Let me 
Œ the best wa y t o put this clear is 

an example. One of the central figures in the German foreign mi nistry i n the 30s 

and 40s, was 
Ribbentrop™s
 
Secretary of State, 
Ernst von Weizsäcker
, who was 
tried after the war, sent  to jail for a few years. At one ti me during the war, when the 
Germans were rounding up Jews to be killed, the y also tried to get them from the 

occupied countries. And when the y started after the Jews of 
Norway
, the Finnish Œ 
excuse me, the Swedish government, informally sounded in 
Berlin
, whether it 

would sati sfy the Germans if they t ook these Jews into 
Sweden
. That  so
unding was 
made to 
Weizsäcker
, and he waved it off. The document was published, in fact, by 

the Germans, in the series a Œ the German edit ed series of the warti m e foreign office 

 
Interview with Gerhard Weinberg

documents from December ™41 to Ma y of ™45. This, of course, is why t he next year, 
when the Germans went after the Danish Jews, the Swedi sh government, instead of 

quietly asking, is i t okay if we take them, announced on the radio, we will take 

them, and the Danes put the Jews on boats and sent them to 
Sweden
. Now, that 
complex is completely mi ssing from this. 
Wei zsäcker
™s 
role, in t he negative sense, 
which ironi cally would have a posi tive i mpact for the Danish Jews, but negative for 

many fro m 
Norway
. And yet, it seems to me that that™s an area where the people 
who put together 
Das Amt
(ph) certainly di d not dig carefully enough into, in this 

instance, the published record. We™re not tal king about some great secret here. The 

document Œ the relevant key document was published many years ago, and is in 
libraries, and not just i n mine. And I think that there are other areas where a more 

careful look Œ now what, of course, I don™t know, is what, if anything, was edited 
out by the official authors of the book, who had people working for them, who ma y 
very well Œ I have no way Œ no inside knowl
edge here 
Œ turn up things that for one 
reason or another they didn™t incl ude, or get around to. But it is, at least, I would 

argue, a respectable start into a set  of issues about continuity and change, that is 

helpful.

 history of

World War II, ﬁ
A World At Arms
,ﬂ which appeared in 1994. What moved you to 
take on such a vast project? 

A: In 1978, I sent off to the University of 
Chi cago 
press, the text  of the second 

volume of the study of 
Hitler™s 
foreign pol icy. And I had to decide what to do next. 

And I will tell you why, of the various possibilities, which I won™t go into, I decided 
to do a World War II hi story. I™m t alking about  ™78. I was very dissatisfied with the 
existing literature on the war, for the following reasons, most of whi ch, I™m afraid, 

still hold. One was that most of those who™ve written on t he war, make the same 

mistake the Germans and Japanese made during the war, it never occurred to them 

that the eart h is round. You would get long discussions of the war in 
Euro pe
, quite 
separate from long discussions of the war in the 
Pacific
. B ut the leaders had to 

make decisions about both, as they were 
both goingon. The mostrecentedition of 
one of the major, well-known books on t he war, I won™t mention the authors here, 
in fact comes out in two volumes. The European war, the 
Pacific
 war. But the y did 
not take place on different planets, in different centuries. The y took place on the 

same cent Œ in the same century, on the same planet, and choices, all ocation of 

resources, decisions about where to launch offensives or defensive 

[indecipherable]
 process, all had to be made by the folks at the t op, about both 

si multaneously. From Œ a second aspect of the literature t hat I was very disturbed 

 
Interview with Gerhard Weinberg

about was Œ especially in this country and 
England
, was a reliance on German 
mil itary memoirs, especially those translated i nto English. And since this is, to a 
very co
nsiderable extent, a collecti on of garbage, the Œ people had been, and 
allowed themselves to be misled. I see recently Œ  I won™t  mention the author, a big 

book on World War II, where the person sti ll believes the fairy tale that Field 
Marshall 
Manstei n
 put into his personal memoirs, that he had ordered 
[indecipherable]
 isolat ed in 
Stali ngrad
 to break out. The reality i s he ma de Œ 
gave 
no such order, but fabri cated it in his memoirs. The oten Œ third factor that I found 

very troubli ng, was the absence of purpose from most of the literature. The 

Germans did not start the war because the French would not allow 
H itler
 to see the 

Eiffel Tower
. There was a purpose to the war, and it was not that  they had an army 

the y didn™t know what to do with one weekend. The war was to start a demographic 
revolution on the globe, of which killing all Jews was to be a central part. Now I™ve 
alwa ys argued it is not a coincidence that when 
Hitler
 ordered in wri ting, the killing 

of the handicapped, in l ate October ™39, he dat ed it for September ™39. And nobody 

can persuade me that that™s because they di dn™t have a calendar. He al so, in his 

speeches, published by the Nazi regi me, in Œ during the war, woul d repeatedly refer 

to his promise to kill all Jews in 
Euro pe
, on 30 Œ 
January ™39
, al wa ys said he di d it 
on Œ for September ™39. Now these two quite deliberate mis-
datings, are,in m y

personal opinion, an int eresting wa y of providing insight into the wa y 
Hitler
 and 
his associat es were t hinking. That is to say, the demographic revol ution was what 
the globe Œ what the war was about. It was not that he al wa ys wanted to see 

Warsaw
, okay? When a killing squad is assigned to 
Rommel
 in the summer of ™42, 
it was not because 
Rommel
 was sent into 
Egypt
 so that they could dismantle the 
pyramids, and re-erect them outside 
Berli n
. It was so that the y Œ he could supervise 
the killing of all Jews in 
Egypt
 and 
Palestine
, before the area was turned over to 

Italy
, as
 Hitler 
planned to do, and he didn™t trust the Italians to do a t horough job. 
And he had very good reasons for Œ for this. The war wasn™t started, as I said, 

without some purpose. And much of the literat ure on the war, completel y disregards 

what was about. And I™ve always thought it was very interesting, that  in the winter 

of ™41 - ™42, in the German records, the diary of 
Fremborg
(ph), 
t he correspondence 
of 
Stief
(ph), they comment on the fact, there are no trains to send wi nter uniforms 
to our soldiers who are freezing to death. Whil e on the same tracks there are plenty 

of trains to take Jews from central
 
Euro pe
 to eastern Œ to be killed. The priorities of 
the regi me, from ti me to ti me, were very clear, but that was missing from the 

literature. A fourth part  of the literature that alarmed me back in ™78, was that there 

had been, in the earli er 70s, and mid-70s, very large scale declassificat ion of 

documents. And most people writi ng on t he wall, found it most expedient not to

look at them. And I knew from m y work on foreign polic y, that t hat™s a very time 
consuming business, and you have to get some grant money to spend time in 

archives, but wasn™t  it about time that these things were utilized? So I decided Œ and 

by thisti me, you understand,I™m ho 
Œ I™m hol ding an endowed chair professorship 
at the university. With it comes a research and travel allocation that Œ that™s what  
I™m gonna do. Although it takes a whil Œ it™s gonna take quite a while, but since 
nobody else has done it, which is part of why I did my book on t he origins of World 

War II, I figured I™d gi ve it a try.  

Q: And it t ook you 16 ye ars? Did I calculate i t correctly? 
A: Not qui te, it took 14. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: Because it took two years for them to get out the book. 
Q: I see. 
A: But the Œ but t he text went off to the publisher in ™92. 

Q: Right. Was it easy t o find a publisher for such an ambi tious project? 

A: Well, the first publi sher, after the y saw being part of it, decided that the y coul d 

not publish a thousand page book on Worl d War II, and so I said okay, though they 

subsequent ly publ ished a thousand page book on the British navy in World War II. 

And I kid them periodi cally as to t he number of copies of that that they ma y have

sold. The next publisher was a university publisher in this country, who got 
confused as to what to do, and so on, so forth, so I shifted. The
 
Cambridge 

University Press editor came to thi s country to see me. And the y decided they 

would do i t, and a Œ since the y had j ust published a book on an import ant figure, for 

which the y were chargi ng either 80 or 90 dollars, I insisted I would not sign with 
them, unless the y woul d promise to keep the cost of the hard bound book under 40 
dollars, which the y proceeded to do. And it was kind of interesti ng that when the y 

sent Œ I suggested that they keep the margins smaller, and that would keep down the 

number of pages. And they assured to Œ I was i nformed, politely, that the y had been 

publishing books in a certain way for several  hundred years, and the y were not 

going to change, even i f it would save a hundred pages. So, it came out, and Œ in 

™94, and they had a marvelous copy editor, whom I got to know, who was in the 
Wrens
, the women™s navy, British navy i n World War II, and who was very good, 
and did a fabulous job of copy edit ing. And they printed i t, and at least to begin 
with, the hardbound was, I think, 35.95, or 36.95, and the softbound was well under 

20 dollars. 

Q: So be yond the competitive prici ng of the book, how do you explain the success 

of this book? Which nerve did you hit wit h it? 

 
Interview with Gerhard Weinberg  
 
March 13, 2012 
 
 
 
70
 
A: Well, I t hink that there are a number of people who have told me the y like the 
comprehensive coverage. They like the fact that if they want to, they can dip into it, 

read a chapter on the home front, read a chapt er on weapons syst ems. Read 

something about t he 
Pacific
 war, if the y™re interested, read somet hing about the war 

in 
Euro pe
. The y Œ the st yl e appears to appeal to people. Scholars like it because i n 
the back notes, I refer t o the archives, and t o issues that still need to be investigat ed. 

And although I repeatedly am tol d that the Œ when faculty assign it as a text in 

World War II courses, at first the students are aghast, because the y see the size of 

the book. The y then like it. It reads well, they tell me, and in one school, where it 

was dropped for another, the students rebel led and said, we want t hat one back. The 

price has Œ has unquestionably hel ped, and of course, by t he time tens, and by now 

hundred thousands are in print, that means that the students who use their 
computers, or their bookstores, can find used copies at very reasonabl e prices, 
at a 
time when other textbooks, including ones in t his field, are getting more and more 

and more expensive, a-and this one is accessible financially. And of course, I 

alwa ys remind people who talk about the size, I tell them it was a big war, and 

that™s not m y fault. And that the y are Œ that is is a multiuse book. That in the 

summer the y can use it  as a doorst op, and that  in the winter the y can keep it in t he 

trunk of their car, and t hen the y wi ll not skid on ice, and if they run into a snowdrift,

they have something to read. So there are all  kinds of advantages, in addition to the 
actual contents o-of it. And th-there™s been translated into German, Spanish, Polish, 

I thi Œ 
I™m not 
Œ Italian. And it™s supposed to be translated into one or two other 
languages, but I have no idea whether it will or not. The only one that I checked 

against the original was the German edition. 
Q: Oka y. 
[break]
 Whi ch are the major 
scholarl y debates
 you found yourself 
involved i n, over t he course of your career? 
A: Well, the first one came when I was asked by the quarterly for contemporary 

history in 
Munich
, in view of m y prior wri tings and work, to writ e a article on the 
German decision to invade the 
Soviet Uni on
. And since I had worked on this a 
good deal, I wrote an article for them in German, had the German corr
ected by m y 

father, and sent it off, and the y published it. We™re talking about around ™54 or five. 
And then, two German scholars responded wit h an article arguing qui te differently, 
and I was given the opportunity to respond to them. Ironically, the key fi gure who 

wrote disputing what I had written was 
Andreas Hillgruber
, a German scholar 

who ironically then eventually came around to m y view, and in hi s bi Œ big book on 

the subject of 
Hitler™s 
strategy, took m y positi on rather than the one, that along 
with 
Seraphim
, who had been his dissertation director, had taken in t heir response 
to me. Thereafter, I was not really so much in direct disputes, as t aking positions

that others very often did not agree with. And that continues to be the case. And t hat 
is true, parti cularly I would argue, i-in relat ion to Holocaust studies, where the 

tendency in the last 30 years or so, has been to do 
Hamlet
 without the Prince of 
Denmark
. Everybody wants to look and does look at this district  commi ssioner, 

that military figure, that local governor, that Gauleiter, or whatnot, but nobody 
wants to look at 
H itler 
any more. And that ™s one area there, where I rather disagree. 
That is to sa y, in a soci et y, not just in a dictatorial society, but also in a democratic 
society, the tone is set at the top. And then people try to accommodate themselves. 

The y have lots of discretion and accommodate themselves in different wa ys, and do 

it differently. But unless one looks at where and what the i mpetus is, people miss 

what™s goi ng on. And I think it is interest ing, t o take just the one rather dramatic 

example, but there has just appeared a big book on the Holocaust  in 
Romania
 
by 
Jean Ancel
. And he makes it very clear that  there™s lots of persecuti on of Jews in 

Romania
 and by Romanians; the Iron Guard, the government and so on. And there 

are some pogroms. But it™s when t he dictator of 
Romania
, 
Antonescu
 meets wi th 
Hitler
 personally on the 12
th
 of June, 1941, and 
Hitler
 tells hi m that after Œ that 
when the newly occupied territories fall under German and Romanian control, all  

the Jews there are to be killed. And it is t hen that the Romanians change. And 

having kill ed and persecuted lots of Jews before, and having killed maybe a couple

thousand, in the following two years the y kill over 400,000. I would suggest that 
there is a difference when a degree becomes a differ Œ difference in kind. That 

aspect, you see, I Œ I see differentl y from most. The other aspect which I see 

differentl y from most is that peopl e keep yakking about killing t he Jews in 
Euro pe
, 
and being unwilling to face up to 
Hitler™s 
view that all on earth needed to be killed. 
When the Germans kill ed the Jews in the 
Dodecanese
 islands in the 
Aegean
, the y 
are living i n what by German definition is a part of 
Asia
. When the y attach a killi ng 
squad to 
Rommel™s 
headquarters in north 
Africa
, at least on m y atlas, neither 
Egypt
 nor 
Palesti ne
 is a part of 
Europe
. And what people si mply don™t want to 
face up to is that 
Hi tler
 personally at great l ength explained to the grand ra Œ mufti 
of 
Jerusalem
, that Jews on the whole eart h have to be kil led. But people find that 
too frightening, I guess, to think about. And s-so therefore, the y keep talking about 
Euro pe
,
 
Euro pe
,
 
Europe
,
 
Europe
, and ignore the fact that it was the military 
operations of the 
Soviet Union
, 
Great Britai n
 and the 
United States
 that 
essentially confineda worldwide scheme, to 
Euro pe
. So there are some issues 
there, which I conti nue to see differently from most. The other Œ another area, I 
guess where Œ although it™s only been expl icit once, I see it  differently from many, 

not all, is on the German military leadership of the second World War, which I 

would suggest that the top and strategy was generally incompetent, when others 

 
Interview with Gerhard Weinberg  
 
March 13, 2012 
 
 
 
74
 
think was competent. And that it  has become a kind of cliché, that they always 
disagreed with 
Hitl er
, and they were right and he was wrong. And usually the y 

agreed with hi m, and very often when they disagreed, he was as often right as the y 

were. In the 
Pacific
 war, I have, for many years been intrigued by the total neglect 
and the discussion of the Japanese plans of whi ch we knew, to kill  all allied 
prisoners of war. And of the Japanese agreem ent at the top, that when the allies 
invaded the home i slands, Japanese casualt ies would be 20 milli on. It ma y well be, I 

have often thought, that the Japanese award in the 60s, of the highest decoration to a 

foreigner, to General 
L
eMay
, who commanded the assault on Œ air assault on the 
home islands, incl uding the great fire raid on 
Tokyo
, and the at omic bombs. 
Perhaps the y realized t hat 150,000 is considerably smaller number than 20 milli on, 

but many of m y colleagues in American history cannot get that arithmet ic as 
straight as evidently the Japanese have.  
Q: You have taught  at four universities; 
Kentucky
, 
Michigan
, 
Chicago
,
 North 
Carolina
. You had a long, fruitful career as a t eacher. When, and under what 

circumstances did you begin to teach the Holocaust? 

A: There are two quite separate answers to t hat. I have taught the Hol ocaust as a 

part of modern 
Europe
, modern German, and World War II history as long as I™ve 
taught, starting, ironically, back in 1954. The first ti me I have taught a course 

 
Interview with Gerhard Weinberg  
 
March 13, 2012 
 
 
 
75
 
entitled Holocaust was here at 
Chapel Hil l
, and that would have been, I would say 
a little Œ 20, or a lit tle over 20 years ago. The Œ the history depart ment  at this 

university has a program of undergraduate seminars called, Hist ory 90s, because 

that™s their number in the catalog. These are li mited to 15. I introduced a History 90 

on the Holocaust, which was the first Hol ocaust taught Œ 
ev
er taught here, around 
20 years ago, or a li ttle more. And it alwa ys filled. But, at the same ti me, I had lots 

of other teaching responsibilities, and the survey courses
; Western Ci v, the World 

since 1945, a big course I introduced. German history, Europea
n 20
th
 century. So I 
would teach this, if you will, one Holocaust seminar for undergraduates, over and o 

Œ a number of times over the years.  

Q: And what were t he reactions to this new course? I mean, what Œ how did the 

students react to it, how did other facult y react to it? 
A: Well, ot her faculty reacted to it in a normal way that a committee has to approve 
courses, and they did. Wit h more or less enthusiasm, I frankly don™t know, because 

that is essentially a rout ine operation. The students filled it up every ti me, and then 

when it got to 15, it was closed, because that was the way that type of course is set 

up in the depart ment. And while once or t wice, under very special conditions, with 

appropriate paperwork, we got a 16
th
 student in. But these were ne ver big lecture 
classes of any sort. 

 
Interview with Gerhard Weinberg

Q: And do you thi nk that Holocaust educati on is now well establi shed in American 
high schools and colleges, or do you think that  interest mi ght wane at some point? 

Or, put differentl y, what challenges do you see for Holocaust educati on in the 

future? 

A: Well, i-it seems to me, I don™t really know enough about secondary education, 
and I know that it i s taught in many insto Œ inst itu Œ high schools in the country. 
And that in many states there are requirement s in this field, and in many states 

efforts are made to prepare teachers, that is public school teachers, properly, so they 

can do this. I do know a little bit ki Œ more about the coll ege and university system, 

and there it is reasonabl y well established, I would argue, for a coupl e of reasons. 

One of them is that there are many scholars who have worked in t he field, who 

accept positions in modern European or modern German history, and who are 
interested i n offering a course on the Holocaust. And the other side of this, 
very 
closely related to thi s, i s that departments who need large numbers of enroll ment s, 

to offset courses the y need to offer, in things li ke medieval  history, where the y™re 

not going t o get large numbers of students, but  need to offer them, are interested in 

the fact that Holocaust courses are always filled. And I know, both from m y own 

PhDs
 around the country, and others, that when there is a course offered, the chairs 

are filled. And if you ask, well, why are the chairs filled, it is not because th
ese 

 
Interview with Gerhard Weinberg  
 
March 13, 2012 
 
 
 
77
 
co
urses are required. It is Œ they are filled because there is a general  public interest, 
and student s are int erested. Whether it satisfies a particular degree requirement or 
not, or can be used as one of a vast number of courses that would fulfill a particul ar 

requirement, th-the real ity is that t he students go to the courses on the Holocaust 

because the y have an interest. They™ve heard about this, the y want to know 
something about it. And if it™s offered, that™s i t. And the other side of this is that 
depart ment chairs know that if one of their faculty members is going to offer a 

course, it™s going to be full. And so, because of the interest out there, not because of 

a requirement that students take it. Under those circumstances, I woul d argue that 

the field is reasonably well establi shed. That doesn™t mean that t here are no issues 

or problems, and I would suggest that the future here depends heavi ly on facult y 

members being honest and forthright about a differentiation between t he Holocaust 
and other genocides. That doesn™t mean that one is a hierarchy of bett er or worse, 
but what I would argue is a sense of differentia Œ differentiation. And it is in thi s 

regard that t he issue I just alluded to, that is to say where I differ with many in t his, 

the concept of a worldwide killing program. All other genocides of which we know, 

are geographically defi ned. The Turks wanted to kill Armenians in 
Armenia
. They 
had not the slightest int erest in Armenians who had emigrated to 
France 
or 
Argentina
 or the 
United States
. Th
e 
Ustaıe
 
in World WarII 
Croati a
 wanted to 

 
Interview with Gerhard Weinberg  
 
March 13, 2012 
 
 
 
78
 
kill Serbs who lived in 
Croatia
. The fact that t here are lots of Serbs living Œ or 
people of Serb descent living in 
Chicago
, they assumed they wouldn™t like when 
they hear about this, but there was no particular interest in going t o 
Chicago
 
to kill 
people of Serb background. One of the major differentiations I would argue, 

between the Holocaust and all other known forms of genocide, was the concept of a 
worldwide program. And I think t hat in t he future, as the t i me in whi ch the 
Holocaust occurred, recedes further and further into the past, and other genocides, 

like the one in 
Rwa nda
, are chronologically seen 50 or a hundred years from now, 
as being about the same time. I think that unless those who do work on the 

Holocaust, both in their research and in their teaching, are ho-honest about 

differentiations, not  that one is worse than another; people are dead whether the y 

are killed in one or the other, but t hat the conceptualization of this was different, 
and novel i n its own way, as well as the implementation on an indust rial scale. I 
think that i s an issue that the teachi ng of the Holocaust, at the college and university 

level in the future, has t o Œ what to engage, the reality as a future generation of 

students looks back on a variety of mass killings, none of which was better or worse 

than the other mass kill ings, but out of which group, the Holocaust st ands apart. Not 

above, not below, but apart, in a cat egory by itself.

Q: Dr. 
Wei nberg
, as you look back on your successful and eventful life, what do 
you remember as the most exciting moments of your scholarly career? Like a 
discovery, recognition and insight, which moment do you remember as particularly 

exciting?  

A: Well, I™m not sure t hat I remember one more than another. I was very excited 
when I got my first  opportunity to teach at the University of 
Chicago
, because I had 
not had that opport unity before, at a college university level. I was quite excited 

when I, in t he summer of ™58, I looked at what turned out to be not a draft of ﬁ
Mein 

Kampf
,ﬂ but this other book of 
Hitler™s
 which, since I was working on German 
foreign polic y, here was 
Adolf
 himself writing on foreign polic y. I thought that that 

wasavery goodcoi nci dence.And Iguess the other momentwas when m y
 wife 
Janet
 took a picture of me at the post office, when I was sending to 
Chicago
, in a 
huge crate, t wo copi es of the Worl d War II book manuscript. 
Q: And what did you find most rewarding, most gratifying in bei ng a scholar and a 

teacher?
 
A: The response of students. I like m y st udent s, even the ones that di dn™t do so well. 

But I like getting a sense of looking at st udent s while I was speaking, when their 

faces sort of lit up a little bit. Oh, I get that . And I was very pleased t o have a 

succession of grad
uate students
 who moved forward in their graduate work, and

none of whom is unemployed toda y. And a Œ a majority of whom went into 
academic careers, but a substantial number into other careers in the government, 

and in archives. And that is always very interesting, because of course, the y learn 

more about the subject the y™re working on than I ever had learned. And it was very 

interesting to have this combination of individuals, and their Œ their relationship 
with me, both then and after they had finished, a-and to see other people make new 
discoveries, this Œ find new connections, and then go forth into t he world Œ the 

academic or the government world, and make successful careers for themselves. 

Q: Is there anything you wish to add to this interview? 

A: Well
, perhaps I should mention the two monuments t hat aren™t up, that I thi nk 

should be up. One monument should be up 
in ger
 Œ or at least plaque should be up 

in 
Germany
, the other in 
England
. Eng Œ 1955, the Aust rian stat e treat y provided 
for an independent 
Austria
, and the allied occupation troops to l eave. When the 
American occupation troops left their zone 
[indecipherable]
 
area around 
Linz
. And 
in one of the barracks t hat the y had ta Œ the Americans had taken over from the 

Germans, t he y found a bunch of records. And those records, it turned out, were the 

records of the area, military area district horse draft board. We forget toda y that i n 

Euro pe
, until World War, and into World War II, governments drafted not just 
people, but also horses. The questi on then arose, what™s to be done with these 

 
Interview with Gerhard Weinberg  
 
March 13, 2012 
 
 
 
81
 
records? The Austrians said, well, these were Austrian horses, and the records were 
in 
Austria
, and the records should go to 
Vienna
, and if the Germans want to look at 
them, they™re welcome. And the Germans said, oh, but these are German records, 

they were created by our agency, t he horses are all dead. The records should go to 

the military archive in 
Freiburg
, and if the Austrians want to use them, the y™re 
welcome. When there are legal questions i n the American military, they go to the 

Judge Advocate General™s office in the Pentagon. And t he lawyers there decided 

uh-uh, these are American records, the y go to 
Alexandria
. Whichis what 
happened. But because the y were American records, the y naturally fall under 

American archive law. And that meant, among other th Œ two thi ngs. Number one, 

that American privacy rules woul d apply to them, and we applied them in our 

microfilmi ng. But it also means that there would be the system of records disposal. 
The the National Archi ves would present t o a joint committee of House and Senate, 
disposal schedules from ti me to ti me. These records go to the National Archives, 

these records go to the regional archive in 
Atl anta
, or wherever. These records get 
destroyed, nobody needs them. These records are sent to 
Germany
, the federal 
republic. And if the congressional joint committee agreed, as I™m informed it 

generally did, that™s how the y got there. And I have therefore been l ong of the 

opinion, both orally and in print, that the Germans should put up at least a plaque in

honor of the Austri an horses who got them their records back. Seems to me only 
reasonable. The Brit s need to put up a plaque, or a monument of some sort, to the 

Duchess of 
Windsor
, because if she had not, as 
Wallace Simpson
, put her sites on 

the man, the Prince of 
Wales
 who became 
Edward 
the eighth, and who abdicated 
in order to marry her, t he British would have been stuck with hi m, whether he 
married someone el se, or remained unmarri ed, for the rest of his life. And sparing 
the British from having hi m as king during World War II, is somethi ng that I™ve 

long argued that people in 
Great Britain
 ought to acknowledge by some kind of 
plaque, or other dedicat ed thing. In m y own work in the British records, it is very 

clear that in 1940, t hi Œ 
by thisti me,the Duke of 
Windsor
, because 
of course, he 
had abdicated before, and 
George 
t he sixth was king, and his wife, the Duchess of 

Windsor
 were, if not very strongly pro-German, inclined in that direction. The y 
had no sense of what reall y was going on in the world. And at a time when
 Britain
 
was being assaulted from t he air, their main concern was t he fate of their furniture 
in the 
Paris 
apart ment, and whether one of his junior aids could get an exemption 

from the British draft. They shipped hi m off to the 
Bahamas
, but this was not t he 

kind of person that  the country needed in it s great hour of need, and people tend to 

forget that 
George
 t he sixth, who became king and was king through the whole war, 

into the beginning of the 50s, when he died, was a man who had t hen, on a British

warship, in 1916, at the Battle of 
Jutland
, the great naval engagement of that war. 
This was somebody who had a connection t o the country, it was t hought that 

Edwa rd 
the eighth never did have. And so, si nce she was the one who took the 

initiative to arrange Œ or have it arranged, let me put it t hat wa y, that  
George 
the 

sixth became king, I think the Brit s owe hi m one Œ owe her one. 
Q: Dr.
