in the recognition of fadeddocumentsthat was startedfour years ago in cooperation with a 
Germ an team f rom  the Universit y of Bremen. Their recent work in the Germ an laboratory had 
led to abreakthrough in the processing of  faded docum ents which is now the subject of three 
U.S. patents andone international patent. They hope to usethis technology to improve the 
usability of f aded docum ents in thism useum.
 
 
W ith that I'd liketoask you to join me in welcom ing our
 
F i rs t  P e rs on
, Gideon 
Frieder.
 
 
[Applause]
 
 
Gideon, thank you som uch for joining us andf or your willin gness to be our
 
F i rs t  
Person
 
today. W ehave justanhourand youhave som uch to share with us so we'll jum p right 
in .
 
Although Germany ove
rran Poland in September
 
1939and soon dom inated 
Europe, your hom e country of Slovakia was allied with the Germans and, theref ore, it was not 
occupied by them untilm uch later.
  
Before we talk about the start of the war andthe events 
that ledup to andfollowin g the Germ an occupation of Slovakia
 
s t a rt, f irs t ,  b y t e llin g u s  a  lit tle  
bit about your fam ily and your com munity and your lif e in thepre
-
war years.
 
>> Gideon Frieder: T here was notm uch in the pre
-
war.  The war started in 1939.  I was 2 
years old.
  
So Idon't recall very m uch.
  
T he pre
-
war years thatI recall were in Nove 
M
esto 
where m y f ather was a rabbi.  He servedf or a while as a chief rabbi of part of the com munities 

in Slovakia.
 
 
I leda regular life. The only thing which was different is thefact that I knew that 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
6
 
certain streets I could not walk throughbecause the children wouldthrow rocks at me andcall 
m e nam es
, 
which I didn't understand really at thetim e.  I do understandthem  today.  Justa 
regular childhood.
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us 
--
 
your f ather was a rem arkablem an. T ell us m ore about him.
 
>> Gideon Frieder:  I'm  a bit biased about my f ather.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Just alittle bit but well
-
f ou n ded .
 
>> Gideon Frieder:  I'll try to stick to things wh ich canbedocumented. 
 
 
My f ather was a very unusual man in the sense that prior to hiseducation in what 
we  c a ll 
Yeshi va
, college, hef inisheda secular degree in a secular universit y.  So he got a 

degree in German literatureand philosophy parallel tobeing ordained asa rabbi.  He spoke 
m
ultiple languages.
  
He wrote a diary
,  
which was the reason I started to work onthe 
docum ents.  He wrote a diary.  Thediary is written in six diff erent languages.  Hedied when he 

was 36 years old.  Sohe was really quite accom plished.
 
 
During the war, theSlovak Jewr y did something which was not typical. T hey get 
various f actionstogether and they createdaworkin g group
; 
which was headed by a woman, 
by the way
.  A
nd thatworkin g group was the underground governmentof  the Slovak
 
J e wr y .   
And he's credite
d i n
 
saving thousandsof  life.  
 
 
In  m
y home, you would see one of the docum ents which was created by donations 
when m y father's remains were m ovedf rom  Slovakia to Israel.  1,010 trees were planted by 
those survi vors which he saved.
 
>> Bill Benson: T hat he had saved.
 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
7
 
>> Gideon Frieder: T he secondtim e it has happened. About1,000 trees were planted by the 
survi vors when hedied in 1946. 
 
 
So he was a rem arkable man. His diary was usedas a major docum entary 
evidence in thetrials of Eichmann, who was the Germ an responsible f or m urdering thousands 
if nottens of thousands of  Jews.  It's still a unique historical docum ent. Among other things, 
oneof  thef irsttestim onies of what happen
ed 
in Auschwit z.  It's docum ented inthose diaries.  
Some people f led 
andhe hadthe opportunity to talkto them .
 
>> Bill Benson:  Gideon, you were, of  course, ver y young when your m other was murdered.  
W e'll hear more aboutthat in a little bit.  Do you know m uchabout your mother that you can 
share with us about her? 
 
>> G
ideon Frieder:  Not really ver y m uch.  I was 7 years old when she died.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n :  Righ t .
 
>> Gideon Frieder:  Many of the things I know cam e tom y attention by reading the diaries.  I'm 
comfortable infour of the languages of the diaries.
 
>> B ill B e n
son:  Fourof the six.
 
>> Gideon Frieder:  Yes.  So I hadnodiff iculty reading the diary.  So partof the inf orm ation is 
f rom  there.  Part of the information is storiesthat I heardf rom others.
 
 
One story
 
--
 
let m e tellyou som ething aboutm yself . I'm  the only scientist inthe 
world which has an article in a cookbook.
 
[Laughter]
 
Really.  T rue story.  There's a cookbook. I think you may even get it in the bookstore. The 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
8
 
cookbook called
 
" Holocaust 
S
u r vi vo r  
C
ookbook
."  Many Holocaust survivor contributed 
recipes.  I love to cook.  I think it's very creative.  So I contributed the recipe. And when you 
contributed a recipe
,  
astory had to be added.  Andone of the stories, the story onm y page
, 
is  
aboutm y f ather, m y mother, which was offered by her Christian neighbors
, t
o get the chicken 
for her children. During the war it was an unusual thing.  She refused as 
t
he chicken was not 
kosher. So if I
 
go theoretically by Jewish la w she could have done it
.  S
he didn'tbecause she 
was that religious. 
 
 
So I have 
another story like that, butfor everything else she was just m y m other.  
T here's a story about her.  W ell, I can tell stories all the tim e.W hy don't you ask questions. 
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us, of  course,the war really did not com eto Slovakia until 1
944 and it 
began elsewhere in Europe inSeptem ber
 
1939.  During that lengthy periodof  alm ostf ive 
years, tell us what youcan about what lif e was likef or yourf ather and your comm unity during 

thatperiod when thefull brunt of the war is happening elsewh
ere. 
 
>> Gideon Frieder:  It's true that the war proper didn't com e to Slovakia until1944 triggered by 

theuprising against the f ascist governmentof Slovakia.  But itdoesn't mean that the Jews 
were not discrim inated.  As a matter of fact, in 1942there was a huge wa ve of deportation of  
Slovak Jews.  T hey were one of thef irst to be deported toAuschwitz.  And Auschwitz was one 
of  thef irst death camps.  It was botha laborcam p and a death camp. T he 
Slovakian
-
Hungarian Jewr y were the first to be deported there
a
f ter the enactm ent of  
anti
-
Jewish legislation by the Slovaks. 
 
 
W e 
associate the Holocaust with the Germ ans. T he Slovak anti
-
Jewish legislation 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
9
 
was harsher than theGerm an Nurem berg Laws.  And that was enacted before1942. In1942 
there was a 
ce
nsus of the Jews specif ically created to get enough inform ation to be able to 
deport the Jews. 
  
 
 
T hat story is really so m ething that is not very well
-
kno wn and should betold. T he 
Slovak governm entpaid, the Slovak governmentpaid, tothe Germ ansf or every Jew they took 

and killed.  So the Slovak governm ent paidf or another country to kill its own citizens just 
because they were Jewish.
 
>> Bill Benson:  If I rem em ber correctly f rom what you toldm e, them oney that they paid 

Germ any hadbeen taken from  Je
ws.
 
>> Gideon Frieder:  Right.  There was som ething called Aryanization. That was the 

conf iscation of the Jewish property.  
 
 
T he reasonI know about it,by the way
 
--
 
it's a n interesting story.  I didn't know 
about it. Soone day a Germaneconom ist com es to them useum  here, a young man who was 

interested in 
t h e 
econom y of thef unding of the SecondW orldW ar by Germ any.  He was 
interested
 h
ow com ea relatively sm all country couldf ight the wholeworld andf und it
.
  
And he 
was interested in the econom ics of it. And he came to the archivesand said
:  T
here is 
knowledge thatthe Slovaks paid the Germ ans;
 
that was part of thefunding to kill the Jews 
a
nd 
I want tof ind thedocument
 a
nd youhave the docum ent
 s
omewhere because the Museum  got 
f rom  theSlovak gover nm ent,f rom the Czech
-
Slovak go vernm ent, copiesof  all thearchives of  
thefascist governm ent, archives relating to the Jewish question, quote/unquote.
 
 
Let
™
s notbeover whelm ed by the generosity.  The Museum  paid
 
$1for every page 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
10
 
they provided so it'snot donef rom pure Christian love.  Or Jewish love
, 
f or that matter.
 
 
[Laughter]
 
 
I'm  part of the Georgetown Universit y now.  T he credo that we subscribed to the 
Judeo
-
Christian values.  So Im ixed the two. 
 
 
So he toldm e therehas to be a document som ewhere thatI can use inm y 
research to substantiate it.  Now, the docum ents which we have areoneafter another. T hey 
are not organized. They were gi ven to us out of boxes. T hey're not organized by subject. 
A
n d 
th e
y™ re  m i c ro
f ilm ed
;  
so I painf ully went over the m icrof ilm s.  He had an idea what period itmay 
be. And I actually found the docum ent. And the docum ent is very, very f ormal that according 
to the governm ent,the agreementbetweenGerm any and Slovakia,paragraph so
-
and
-
so, we 
ask you transfer som uch moneyf unded by this particular budgetary item . So we followed the 

budgetary item tof indwhat it is.  And it's theconf iscation of the Jewish property. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Youmentioned, Gideon, thecensusthat was taken.  Tell us what was 
s ign if ic a n t 
aboutthat censusof  Jews that was taken.
 
>> Gideon Frieder:  In 1942, the Slovak gover nm ent did a census ofthe Jews, divided into 

groups by age, by profession,by gender.  And it was a very, ver y detaileddescription of the 
Jewr y. W hen we got these documents, I was asked by the Museum tof ind the census, togo 
over it.
 
 
You see,I hada unique position inthe volunteer group of them useum .  I was 
absolutely the bestSlovak speaker inthe museumf or the sim ple reasonI was theonly one.
 
[Laughter]
 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
11
 
S o  I  we
ntover it.  Ifound am ong other thingsthat
 
--
 
thepage describing m yself, describing m y 
fam ily.  And in the collection
, 
it was done by cities, by sm all cities.  In som e cases there were 
no Jews in the sm all city.  And in som e cases there was adocument. 
 ﬁ
In some cases
ﬂ
?  Many 
cases. There was adocument saying, "
W
eare proud to tell you that there are no Jews in this 
m unicipality and we intend to keep it that way."   
 
 
So it was a sobering experience to goover the census. It was ver y well done.  It 
wa s
 
used to identif y the Jews for the deportation.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Before we turn to theuprising and thenall theterrorthathappened af ter that 
for you, yourf ather, as you said, was very engaged in rescue efforts. Working under a very 
anti
-
S em it ic
 
gover
nm ent with those very harsh laws, as you mentioned, you toldm ethat you 
were som ewhat protectedfrom thef ull bruntof  thatby your f ather.
 
>> Gideon Frieder: W e were essentially ver y protected.  He was aprotectedperson.  Hewas 
kind of the Secretary of  Stateof  that group. He spokef luently Germ an, Slovak,and 
Hungarian, so he could deal with theGermans, deal with the Slovaks.  He spokeLatin.  He 
coulddeal with the upper clergy.  Slovakia is m ostly Catholic country
.  E
ven today 85% are 
Ca t h o lic .   H
e had a very good relationship wit h the Catholic clergy, which was kind of  

interesting because the priests
 
--
 
t he  
p
resident of the country who enacted all of these laws 
was a Catholic priest.  
 
 
By the way, af terthe SecondW orldW ar, hewas tried andexecuted asa war 
crim inal, oneof  the very f ew m enof  cloth which was prosecutedandf ound guilty.
 
 
So we were ver y m uch protectedf rom it. And that protection prevailed essentially 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
12
 
until 1944.  It didnot prevent, by the way, the Germ ans to deporthisparen
ts, m y f ath e r's 
parents,m y grandparents. They were taken to Auschwit z and killedim mediately because they 
were old. T hey were ofnousefor them  as workers.  Did notprotect thefamily at all.
 
>> Bill Benson:  I wasgoing to ask you next that very question.  Didyou losef am ily m em
b er s  
during that period? And obviously you did.
 
>> Gideon Frieder:  I lost alm ostall m yf am ily during that period.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You had toldm eananecdote or a story thattherewas one prominentoff icial 
in the Slovak government that really was in yourf ather's debt which m ay have helped to 
protecthim a little bit.
 
>> Gideon Frieder:  Right.  So, part of the protection of m y father
 
--
 
part of the reasonhe was 
so protected, notonly because he was afunctionary representing the Jewr y and could talkto 
them , butthere was a particularm em berof  the Slovak governm entwhich wanted to be known 
for his 
s
cholarly achievem ents.
  
So m y f ather wrote f or him  a D
octoral dissertation.  And the 
guy got a D
octorate
o
n m y f a t he r's d isse
rtation.  Andthere'sa certain psychological tie 
between your advisor and yourself .  Itdoesn't matterhow you m ay hate him or not.
 
 
So each tim e there was a needf or som e consultation on, quote, academ ic affairs, 
m y f ather was summ oned.  And it'sof ten this guy who was responsible f or the Jews was 
summ onedf rom his room  while m yf ather was thereand used thetim eto kind of rummage 
through thedocum ents and find out what is really happening.  So that helpeda lot.
 
 
T he details, you see,I didn't know f rom
 
m y own knowledge.  It's all part of the 
diaries. T hey are well docum ented. The diaries
 
--
 
there was abookwritten by m y unclebased 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
13
 
on thediaries.  It was written in Hebrew, eventually translated to English.  It was available.  It's 
now out of print. 
 
But if any of  you want a copy of  it, just sendm e ane
-
m ail. I'll send you an 
electronic copy. T hat's wr itten inEnglish.  Half of  it isbasedon thediaries, very abbreviated, 

obviously, and half  of it is based on whatm y uncle did af ter m yf ather died.  He tookhis 
position as thehead of Jewr y and was in theposition untilheem igrated toIsrael.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You are going to get an e
-
m ail f rom  m e about that. 
 
>> Gideon Frieder:  Ihave to tell you,I checkm y e
-
m ail oncea year.
 
 
[Laughter]
 
>> B i
ll Benson: W hich begins tom orrow, I hope. TheSlovak National Uprising occurred in 
August
 
1944, and ithad an imm ediateeffecton you and yourfam ily.
 
>> Gideon Frieder:  Yes.
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us what theuprising was andthen what its effect was on
 
you in thedays 
and weeks thatf ollowed.
 
>> Gideon Frieder: W ell, you know, when there is a war, the bad thing is to be on the side of  

the losers. T he Slovaks decided to be on theside of the non
-
losers. There was an opposition 
to thefascist government,a unique onebecause it was one of the unique times inhistory that 

W
estern support partisans by the 
W
estern ally and Comm unist support partisans by the Soviet 
Union cooperated, essentially cooperated and createdanuprising against thef ascist 

governm e
n t.
  
 
 
As you lookat them ap of Slovakia, if Slovakia is takenaway f rom  the German 
s e lf
-
inf luence, it shuts the capability f rom thesouth to get into Germany.  Soanybody who 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
14
 
looks at the mapand has any m ilitary understanding
 
would understand the German
s 
ha d  t o 
cross that uprising.  And they invaded. T hey invaded
.  T
heforce was m ainlyW affen SS, which 
was thef ighting unitof the SS. And they hadboth Germ an and Ukrainian part of the Germ an 
Arm y, of  theW affen SS.  Ukrainian SS members.  Andthey inva
ded.
  
O b vi o u s l y i t wa s  ve r y 
clear that this isthe end of any protection, end of everything.  T he Germans arehere.  Andthe 

Ukrainians arehere, which were far more cruel than the Germ an
s 
ever were, at least f rom  m y 
perspective as a child.  I'm  not a hist
orian.T hese are m y perspectives. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  So the Germans invade.
 
>> Gideon Frieder: T he Germans invaded.  It was ver y clear that we are done.
 
 
My f ather was very wel l
-

what the Miranda rights are. They would see him, shoot him ,and that's it. Sohedecided that 

he cannot stay with usbecause if he isfound

by association he will be killed.  So he sent us, 
us meaning m y m other, m y sister andm e,f rom  the city.  But 
t he  
city was already under siege.  
Nove Mesto was the city.  So he puts us in an ambulanceand sent the am bulance toward the 
Germ an lines.  Nobody would suspect an am bulance towards the Germ an lines would have 
any Jews in it.  Once the am bulance was out of  the city, obviously we
 
turned around. W e f led.  
T he am bulance brokedown.  A long story.  Eventually we had tom ove onf oot.  Wemove on

>> Gideon Frieder:  Bystrica. 
 
>> Bill Benson: W hywas that your destination?
 
>> Gideon Frieder: T hat was the center of the uprising. T he wholearea was under total 

control of the partisans
, t
he Russian supporters.
 
>>
 
Bill Benson: W orking together.
 
>> Gideon Frieder: W orking together as a group. T here was a large contingency of  Jewish 
partisans. T hat was the place to go. T hat was a safe haven.  And we congregated there
; 
lo t s  
of  people congregated, Jews and non

T he southern part of Slovakia is a plain.  Andthat's wherem ost of the agriculture

the

So we went there.  My m other was identif iedas the wif eof  Rabbi Frieder. She was ver y well

som e sense. It was af ter the invasion of Norm andy.  It was under the big offensive of the 
Soviet Union.  T he Soviets were n
ow in Poland, on the northern border of  Slovakia. T hey were 
behind them ountains.  They couldhave gotten in and supported thepartisans
 w
ithin a couple 
of  da ys .
  
T he Soviets,for their own reason, let theSlovaks bleed to death.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So they could have com e in.
 
>> Gideon Frieder: T hey could have savedSlovakia.  They did not. They were sitting behind 

them ountains waiting for theSlovaks totake the brunt. It'sa very di sputed pointof  history.  As 
I told you, I'm not ahistorian
 b
ut these arethef acts.  Thefact is they could have com e. They 
didn't. 
 
And the Slovak partisans, especially the Russian
-
supportedones,100% sure, I assum e 
that here they are behind the m ountains
; w
hat's the big deal?
 
>> Bill Benson:  Ourben

there was thishuge defeat of the Germ an 
arm ies of  the 
E

So everybody f eltthat's it.  Anyway, they would not com e to them ountains. T hey 
now
 
have their safe passage to Germany, through the Slovakiaplains and through 
Mora
vi a
.  
But itdidn't happen. They wanted to crush the rebellion.  Andthey startedto come
 
--
 
there 
was a big panic
, a
 
big panic to thepoint that I as a child seenthat everybody was running 
around.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Youfelt thepanic yourself.
 
>> Gideon Frieder:  Everybody.  It was vis ible.  People were running.  People were shouting.

that point?
 
>> Gideon Frieder:  No.  No.  No.
 
>> Bill Benson:  He put you in the am bulance.  Asfar as you knew, he was gone.
 
>> Gideon Frieder:  He was gone.  Nobody knew.  Nobody knew wh ere he is.  You know, it 
was a war.  So when we were there, m y mother bef riended this guy, 
H
enry Her zog.  His 
Hebrew nam e was Adam .  
 
 
My grandson is calledAdam  after Henry who passed away several years ago, well 
bef ore Adam was born. 
  
 
 
So she bef riendedhim.  T hen there was in this panic.  Everybody wanted to leave. 
 
Adam  is a partisan,his unit together were to leave and go tothe mountains to keep onf ighting.  

Sheasked him totakeus with him , which he ref used.  He was part of the f ighting unit.  But 
eventually she prevailed.  Hedid takeus with them . W e wenton
 
foot to thenorth through this 
m ountain passagef rom  Banska Bystrica to them ountains.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So inBanska Bystrica, you have a com bination of f ighters, the
 
partisans but 
also civilians, wom en and children.
 
>> Gideon Frieder:  Many civi lians, wom en and children
; m
ost of  them  non
-
Jewish, obviously.  
T he Slovaks, which were not associated with thefascist,f led. Ina war situation, if  youare 

Jewish or not, if  youare caught, you are killed.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So the partisans, of course, as f ightin
g units for the m ost part aren't taking the 

wom en and children with them but your mother
 
--
 
>> Gideon Frieder: T hey were not taking wom en and children. The wom en and children were

-
dr
awn carriages.  Cars 
were breaking down and running out off uel. And we were attackedin Stare Hory with a 
clearly highl y trained Arm y, the Germ ans. And they did what every highly trained Arm y wo uld 
do. They bom bed theexit.  They bombed the entrance. 
T hey 
c a u ght  
us inthe m iddle.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Am ountain pass.
 
>> Gideon Frieder:  It's a 
g
orge m ore thana valley.  I would say about 200
 
m eters wide there.  
T here was a road. That was it. T here was m ountains on one side. T here was a dirt road. 
 
>> B i

>> Gideon Frieder: W e were caught with allof  these slow
-
m oving p eople in them ountain 
passage.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You were attacked by planes?
 

>> Gideon Frieder: W e were attackedby planes. There was an actual massacre.  
T here was 
no place tof lee. W efled running up the mountains.  And on theedge of  theforest we wer e hit. 

My m other and sister were killed im m ediately.  I was wounded by two bullets inm y leg.  
 
 
I  wa s  ve r y l uc k y.
  
In Europe,at the tim e, children,boys,
 
didn't wear long pants.  
T hat was a sign of maturity.  You got long pants when you were imm ature.  When you were 

young, you wear shorts.  But it was ver y cold.  So children in Europe at the tim e, boys and 
girls, wore thick woolen stockings
 
he
ld by garters.  Boys and girls.  Doesn'tm atter. And Iwore 
these thick woolen stockings.  And when I was hit exactly here, when I was hit, I was lucky
:  n
o 
m ajor artery was 
s

;  
no bone shattered
; 
nom ajornerve severed.  But theblood gushed 
and it saturated the
 
woolen stockings.  It was ver y cold.  And the blood coagulated and created

So, you know, a couple of  centim eters lower, m y 
knee wouldbe shattered and I would be dead, disabled, lef t todie. 
 
 
Henry was f leeing aswell.  His stor y is am azing in itself .  His story i s chronicled in a 
book which Ihave topublish about his lif e. The name of the book,which I selected, was 
" Heaven Did N

>> Bill Benson:  " Heaven Did N

I workedwith him  onhis mem oirs.  I acceptedthe part 
where he metm y wif e

his book was
 
published, it took the "
H

D
idn't 
C

f rom  thebook.  He was f leeing together with another partisan.  Andtheother partisan was hit 
by several bullets and fell onhim . He tumbled into the groundunder thebody 
of th i s  pa r t i s an  
who was riddled with bullets
 b
ut he was nottouched because the other guy saved his lif e.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And then he saved your lif e.
 
>> Gideon Frieder:  And thenhefoundm e standing next to m y m other.  I was crying.  I 
couldn't get her
 
to get up. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Do you remember that specifically? 
 
>> Gideon Frieder:  Boy, do I rem em ber it.  She was lying on her back with her eyes open. I 
did not understand why she was not getting up.  My sister was on her stomach. I didn't see 
her f

>> Gideon Frieder:  3years old.  She was 3years old. 
 
>> Bill Benson: W hatdid Henry
 
--
 
>> Gideon Frieder:  Henry took me and said,"I'll bring your m other later."  And here was an 
am azing thing happened in substance.  His book chronicledthe time I was with them with the 
partisans in them ountains.  In hisbook it is very clear that I was in the m ountain with them for 
seven days.  And so he carriedm eonhis back.  I don't remember that tim e.  It didn't exist. 
 
In  
m y m indI was takenf rom  the massacreandput in this village of 
B
ully.  I have no recollection 
whatsoever of those seven days. Theonly reasonI know is the book. 
 
Im et him af ter the war.  
He toldm e about it.  It just doesn'texist. 
 

 
So he tookm e
 
--
 
thepartisans decided that the 7

old boy
 
--
 
they didn't know 
thatI am  wounded, by the way.  Ever ybody was covered with blood. The showers were not 

existing, obviousl y, not in the mountains.  Everybody was covered in blood.  T hisbandage
 
--
 
>> B i l

>> Gideon Frieder:  Had really sealedthe wound. There was nof urther bleeding.  I was 
carried on the back not becauseof  the wound butbecause
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  Keepup with the partisans.
 
>> Gideon Frieder:  Keep up. I'm not sure that he was the only onewho carried m e.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So hecan't continue

would not even say it was a vil lage.  It was a sm all

no t  af t e r  
the war.  I was there the first time in1990
-
som ething.  I couldn't gobef ore.  Hebroughtme 
there. And here a story di vulges as well. 
 
 
Learning f rom  his book, what
 
he writes in thebook, thesepartisanswere not clean 
shaven. T hey lived in the m ountains. T hey had these Germ an
-
acquired weaponry, hand 
grenadeshanging over them . They had to be a very f earsom e looking set of individuals. They 
com e tothe building. 
 
T hey tell thepeople
 
--
 
th is is He n ry's st o ry.
 
>> Bill Benson: T he one he tells in his book.
 
>> Gideon Frieder: T he one he tells in his book, notm y recollection.  He tells thepeople that 
I'm  a Jewish boy, that I'm  a sonof a very prom inent person, and
 
that they put me intheir care 
and if they don't want to take me in their care
 
they wil l kill them.  Notver y m uch choice
, i
s 
there? T hat's his story.  Makes sense. 
 
 
From  m y point of  view
 
--
 
I was outside when they talked.  From m y point of view, 
they broughtm e in. And all I recollect istotal love
, w
arm  care.  Incredible
, t
he difference 
betweenm y recollection and what he said.  Maybe they were threatened, but they didn'tdoit 

because they were threatened.
  
I have proof to these things. T his is not 
th e time  to d iscu ss it, 
but I have proof  that they really did it f rom  what they considered Christian love.  Very, ver y,  

ver y devout Catholics.

the stove another room .  The stove protruding into both room sf orheat. 
 
Myself and the brother 
of  the wom an lived in one room . T he husband and wif e lived in theother. And all I remember 

is care. T hey shavedfood f rom their own m outh tofeed me. I was alwa ys hungry.  Because 
ever ybody was.  But Iwas 
never
 
starved.  And there's a diff erence. Because they fedm e.  
T hey didn't have an abundan

wounded.  T hey f ound

th a t little

of 40, 50 houses saved 10 Jews.  Oneof  them  was 
an ophthalm ologist.  And he was summ onedby them to carefor m y wounds.  You know, close

obviously to the community
 
thefact that youwere there or others couldn't have been a secret.
 
>> Gideon Frieder:  Couldn'thave beena secret.  Som y cover story was that I was the son of  

thebrother of the wom an.  And the brotherof the wom an was killedby the partisans.W hy?  
Because it would give m e a certain credentials.  If m y father was kill ed by the partisans, 
obviously I am  noton the partisan side
 a
nd
 
clearly I cannot be Jewish.  Andthey gave m ea 
Slovak name. I was not called Gideon Frieder. T hey gave m e the name Ja

dangerous.  In the hut next to thehutI lived the Germ ans once came andfound apartisanin

the hut
 
with the people, with the partisan,next tom y 
house.

by the way, thatbuilding is still

>> Gideon Frieder:  Incredible danger.  It was a danger of  life.  It was not som ething that they 

would be slapped on the hand. 
 
T hey would be executed.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You said to me once that the Germans ruled by day, the partisans by night.

large Germ an presence.  After theSS conquered allof  it,theW affen SS, they were not 
replaced but they were  supplementedby a Germ an garrison of oldm en because all the young 
were killed.  Andthat 
ham let
 
was notbig enough or not strategically im portant enough to have 
a garrison there.  It was in the m iddleof  the way f rom  nowhere
 
to nowhere
.  So they would 
patrol during theday just to see that everything's available.  And during thenight, its partisans 
would com e downf rom  them ountains to bein a warm  hut. They would go and sleep in the

T he poor villagers by the day were dom inated by theGermans,by

they survi ved som ehow.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And that continuedfor you u

1945 when thewar ended.
 
>> Gideon Frieder:  Continued until April
 
1945 because the
 
--
 
a Romanian contingent fighting 
as partof theSoviet Red Arm y liberatedthatpart.  For many Slovak
s 
the word " liberated"  is 
ver y m uch indispute.  For m any Slovaks they replaced the Germ anoccupation with a Russian 
occupation.  But it's som ething todiscuss ina ver y diff erent context.  But for everybody, the 
Germ ans were
 
gone.T he western part of Czechoslovakia was liberated by American Army 
led by General Patton. The eastern part was liberated by the Soviet

they came inApril.

him  andheused themwith great naturalness, bitter experience hardened him.

Synagogues were burned.  Jews were beaten
 o
n t he  s t r e et
, t
heir businesses 
burned. And, no, I'm  not talking about the Holocaust.  I
 
am talking about som ething which 
happened two years
 
--
 
two days ago in Paris.  If you ask if there will be another Holocaust,you 
don't have to go f arther
 e
xcept the Holocaustof the 21st Century, which already started, wi ll 
m ake the Holocaust of  the prev
ious century as a littleflame relative to abom bf ire. T hink 
about it when you leave here.  It may notaff ect m e.  I will be dead.  It may not affect you.  But 
it wil l affect your children
 a
nd grandchildren. W eare today in the sam eplacethat the world
 
was in 1932. W hen businessesare burned and people are beaten,the world is silent.T he 

world doesn't do anything.  Oh,m aybethey say som ething, but they don't do anything. Exactly 
what happened in the30s of the previous century which brought inthe Holocaust of the 20th 
Century.
 
 
W hen 
on e  of  
our mostbeloved presidents, President Kennedy, was quotedto say 
thehottestplaces in hell are reservedfor those which in time of need kept their quiet, don't you 
reserve your places there.  Act
, b

o that thefate

so that thefatethat befelled m e 
wi ll not happen to your children.
 
 
T hank you.
