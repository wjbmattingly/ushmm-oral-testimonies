school resumed after a

by artillery emplacements on the street  
corners and ar med troops at i nte

political ins and outs of

that my father took long summ
er vacations, during wh
ich he established a new identity as a n  
itinerant farm laborer on
 farms along the Austrian-Czechoslo
vak border.  The growth of the  
Austria n Na zi part y was palpable , 
alt hough again as a c hild I did not
, that did not r egis t er wi th me  
partic ularl y.  Whe n t he  Naz i s, or  when Ansc hlus
s came , in March of 1938,
 and the German ar my 
mar che d i n unoppose d, ei ther by Au
st ria or any ot her i nter nati onal  
commu nity, a nd apparentl y wit h  
the tacit backing of Mussolini in Italy, the recepti
on that I sa w of t he Ger m an troops , you know the 
Naz is, by t he Austri an popula
tion wa s over w hel mi ng.  And for 
example, many of the active  
social ists, even those in t he underg
r o und, s wit che d par ties 
and joined t he Nazi pa
rty.  Some of them 
war ned my fat her  that because
 t hey knew, now the Nazis woul
d know about  his under groun d 
activities and that he and his associate, Ernst Pollit(
ph) would be very wise to
 cut it out immediately.  
My father, Fritz Treuer, 
was under no illusions what
 the advent of the Nazi
s meant, he knew about 
the Nure mb erg la ws , about the pers ecuti on of t h
e Je ws , about c onfi sca tion of property, a nd he  

i mme diat ely starte d ma king e f for t s t o get us out  of 
t he c ount r y.  Some  of the  rest  of our relati ves  
wer e not as alar med as he was,
 my mother 's t w o sist ers and th
eir husba nds , profe ssi onal pe opl e, 
thought that well, they were engi
neers, they had particular skills
 that were in demand and they  
didn't , while  things mi ght be unplea s ant, t here wa
s no great danger.  My father tried to tell the m 
other wi se and was  not be lieve d.  He a l so tri ed to ge
t thr ee or four J ewish boys t oge ther  a nd give us 
the beginnings of rudime
ntary military traini
ng in somebody's ga
rden behind a house, a high hedge 
or a  wall around it , 
it lasted exactly two time
s, two afternoons after sc
hool.  Some body sa w us , it  
was reported and one the erstwhile socialists got 
a hol d of Da d and said t hi s had bet t er stop ri ght  
now or you'r e going to get nailed.  That was the 
end of that.  My accor di

our house in a streetcar, 
wa s stoppe d in the stre et.  He was a

ha ve bee n bi g e nough to t ake  
care of any two or three of them.  
It wa s impossible, they we re ar me

lesson.  Ha mli sh incide nta

I 'm not sure exact ly how they came  
to Ne w York, the y subse q uentl y ha d c hildre n born in
 this country, one of wh

a musical  arr anger. 
Q: I wa nte d  to as k, be fore the Ansc hlus s, a nd 
you me ntione d speci fic all y 
that when you were i n  
school and you wer e sit

aske d you t o  stop, was  th

 was be fore Ma rch 1938?  
A:  No, t he  only inci de nt of a n
ti- Se mit i s m t hat I  e x perie nce d?  
Q: No,  th ere  wer e  ma ny , t hat
 was j ust  a representat ive? 

A: That was a represent a tive, t here were many, an
d on t he str e et there wa s the usual bul lying.  M y 
parents took the attitude that
 whether it was racial or 
not, I had to fi ght my ow
n fights, which I did. 
The a nti- Se miti s m was generic a nd general a nd you pi
c ked up on it i n ma ny s ubtl e  wa ys.  It was not 
usually viol e nt, e xce pt as  when
 kids fought on t h e street s, al
t hough I do re me mber one incide nt  
whi c h ma y give you t he  fl av
or of it, is before the Anschluss, so
me of us kids  were pl aying i n the  
street and I was, chasing

ran into a bicyclist hard 
enough, I be nt the  front wh

it.  I got some good cuts
 and br uise s out of that  
one, but he i m me diate l y fo

wh o my fat her was an d  he was a 
l ocal Nazi, r e member 
this wa s before the An schluss, and he 
mar c he d me  and his da ma ge d bi ke to Dad's stor e 
and swung enough weight 
by virtue  of hi s part y

t o me a nd ta ke me to t he e mer ge ncy room, which  
wa s done lat er, he ha d to pay t he

the Anschluss, and very 
quickly saw, there was su
ch an explosion 
of uniforms, Hitle
r youth and so  
on, a ma zingl y fa st.  Ther e 
were round-ups of Je
ws in the streets, made to
 sc rub t he streets.  Thi s  
happened to a distant relative of 
ours, and elderly wo ma n, not in go
od healt h and when some of t h e 
people sta nding ar ound ma de re mar ks about tha t  
to the stor m troopers who were c onducti ng t h e 
street scrubbing, one of them wa
l ked over t o the woman and sa id, 
well I t hi nk ma ybe you can get up  
and lea ve , it  see ms you'r e not Je wis h , and s he sa
id, ye s I a m, I 'm 400% Je
wish, all four of my 
grandparents are Jews.  A si mila
r t hing ha ppene d t o my
 mother  who wa s r o und
ed up bet wee n piano 
lessons, on the streets of Vienna, 
and she was bl
onde, blue-eyed, petite
.  If you wanted
 a poster girl 
for your Ar yan woma n, she would have bee n it
, and a gai n when s he wa
s down the r e scrubbi ng 
streets, people started to mutt
er that  these st upi d SS me n, SA 
men didn't know wh at they were  
doi ng, look at thi s, 
and one  of t he m  told mom 
to get up and get out of 
t here and s he  said, no I 'm 
Je wish, I  bel ong here t he sa me as 
the rest of these people,
 I'll go when they go. 
 And I t hi nk t hat  was  
a very short- lived, street  s crubbing.
  It wa sn't always that kind. 
Q: So i m me diatel y a f ter  Ansc hlus
s, you i mmediat ely felt an i mp
act  on your pers onal li ves?  
A: It was i m me diate a nd it was ma ssi ve.  In the p
opular support, and you heard nothi ng against it, 
no one spoke against it, a
nd my parents got bu
sy, my father particularly. 
  Reme mber 
him telling my 
mother that it was only a matter 
of days be fore the Nure mb erg la ws we re appli ed, as indee d the y  
wer e, and t h at they ha d t o do ev
er yt hing possi ble to get out  of the 
countr y.  Now I l a

in my pare nt s personal  papers , and t h en t he y 'r e  
both dea d now, corr es ponde
nce to Boli vi a, Mexi co, 
Chi li, anywhere  possi bl e to ge
t  out.  What  eventually happen
ed w a s that my  mo ther fou nd  
e mployme nt  as a house mai d in a r u ral Englis h hous

Thr ough a r efugee agency, 
a pla ce wa s found for me 
in an English boarding
 sc hool, an Orthodox

 my mot her 's  e mployers would not al low a c hild, 
however t he place i n t he boar ding sch

We wer e taken t o the rail way station, t he  
_______, t h e west  rail way i n Vie nna
 by my  father and a few family
 fri ends, I had no brother s or  
sisters and took the train thro
ugh Austria, Germany,
 exiting Germany at ___
___ through Belgium 
and t he n to t ake t he boat , the c hannel boat t o Engl and, e xce pt t hat at ______, t he trai n wa s stopped, 
all Je ws wer e taken off, r ounde d 
up a nd surr ounde d by hea vily ar me
d police , SS and others, and t he  
train pulled out and le ft.  The reas on for that, I 
don't know, it could have been that one person on 
boar d the tra i n ha d trie d t o s muggl e c ontra ba nd out, at
 least that's wh
at was said.  We we re sta ndi ng  
in a cl ust er a ppr oxi ma tel y, I woul d guess  about 40 or
 50 r e fugees wi th our lu
gga ge, such as it was ,  
and ti ghtl y he mme d in by ar med gua rds.  M y mother
, Mia Tr euer and I , wer e
 in the middle of thi s  
cluster and she took a qui
ck l ook around, cla mpe d 
my  hand in hers and we
 each had a suitcase i n  
the other ha nds a nd whi spere d to me, she s aid, 
don't look, don't sa y an
ythi ng, come.  And she  
marched through the 
middle of this packed littl
e crowd, between two guard
s looking neither left nor 
right and they looked a little surprised and she kept right on going, I with her, into the restaurant, 

station re sta urant , where  I ha
d the first cup of coffee in my life, 
a nd we  sat  very quietl y, she a nd I at  
that r esta ura nt ta ble, nurs ing a c o
ffee.  I don't know what happened to
 the rest of the refugees taken 

off the train.  We sat in that ca
fe for hours until the next train ca
me , at which time
 I was ready to  
leap up and run for the tr ain, a nd 
wit h  one look at my mo
m and I sat right where I was.  People got  
off that tr ain, other pe opl e got on a nd she di dn't 
make a move .  I was j ust bursti ng with i mpatie nce  
because I knew I was waiti ng t her e.  And at t he 
last mo ment she sai d, ve
ry a brupt , come .  We  
grabbe d our suitca ses , out the door, up the ste ps of
 the train and it started 
to mo ve , it wa s movi ng a s  
we found seats in t he trai

owe her my li fe .  No
t only in the sense

that s he gave me birt h.  The tr ip t hr ough Bel g

vent ful a nd the c hannel  
crossing eventful only by my gettin
g sick to my stomach.
  Took the ____ train 
to London where my  
fat her 's br ot her wa s wai ting for us .  I don't know
 how he got out, I s us p
ect he was  in London 
illegall y, but  I don't  know the cir cumst anc es.  He 
met us at the train, t ook us to a hotel .  As we 
rounded t he corner t o ent er the hote
l , roof to floor, Nazi ba nner s 
are  flyi ng t here  
and I  panic ked, I  
wa s terri fi ed, I di dn't know what 
had happe ned, were we back in 
Ger ma ny or what?  
 But it turned 
out s o me s p orting event  and t he Na
zi team was being hosted in 
London.  The ne
xt morni ng my  
mother took the train fo r her employm
ent out in the country 
si de.  My uncl e took me t o  the sc hool 
where I was to attend.  
Turned out to be an 
Orthodox Jewi sh school.  Th e headmaster, my  
recollection is a black coat, white 
shi r t, black ti e, a bl
ack hat, full beard.  
Looke d me  over  as  I wa s  
brought into his office and said this
 boy is not a Je w.  My hair wa s 
____.  My uncle as sure d hi m t h at 
I was.  I was quizzed on my k
nowl edge of Hebrew which wa s none
xistent, al though in a cram 
cour se, a n e ffort was ma de to teac h me s o met hing be
fore I left .  It hadn't 
take n.  And although my 
knowl edge of Englis h wa s ver y limite d, I onl y had 
a fe w wor ds at that ti me , I underst ood ver y  
clearl y that he wouldn't take me.  
Because t his was a strict  reli gi ous
 sc hool a nd he 
could not viol ate  
the inte grit y of the sc hool .  My unc le plea ded wit h  
hi m, first ti me I ever he
ard my uncl e plead wit h  
anyone.  He  wa s a  mount ain cli mber, kayaker , ski er,
 and boyhood i dol
 of mi ne.  But he pleaded, he 
said t here was a real risk and a danger t hat i f 
I wer e n ot wh ere I was  su
ppose d to be  I woul d b e  
deporte d a n d no que stions a ske d, it would be  i m
me diat e, a nd his plea di

effect beca us e the he admaster of t he s chool di d 
consider it and he as ked 
one  mor e questi on, I didn't  
underst and t he Engl ish, i t  had t o be tr anslat ed 
for me , a nd t he que stion wa

the answer  was no, and he 
s aid, no we can't t ake  hi m.  Not  e ven
 for one day, not for t wo da ys .  We  
left.  Just how my uncl e found another boardi ng

secular.  I don't know
, but before the end of th
e day he had found another 
school that would take me  
in free, there was no 
money.  Wh at little our fa
mily had had been sequ
estered and we had no  
mone y.  This sc hool turned
 out to be a s na ke pit.  M y fir s
t night t her e, sle epi ng i n the l arge  
dor mit ory with many other boys my a ge, one start e
d scre a ming in great pa in, and I trie d to fi nd out  
fr om the boy in the be d next to mi ne what was 
going on and I didn't unders tand t he English, a nd he  
pointed at his appendix 
and I knew what that wa
s, the boy had appendicitis
 and he screamed for a 
long time before finally some of 
the staff showed up and the gist of
 what they had told hi m was to 
turn over a n d pr ay.  We l l
 I under stood that cle arl y enough, I  
found myself in a 
place where i f you 
had appendicitis, you prayed.  The ne
xt day the other kids went to va
rious classes, I 
had no English, 
they t old me  to ha ng around in t he ki tche n and I 
did.  I wa s ra ped be fore t he day wa s out , by a st a f f 
me mb er .  I t old no  o ne . 
 I felt r es pons i ble for what  ha d happe n
ed, it was my fa ult.
  I  di dn't ____find 
out until long afterwards that this is a common reaction of
 vi c t i ms, of c hil d vi
ctims of sexual abuse 
that t he c hil d ta kes on the ba d fe
elings a bout what ha ppene d.  It 's
 a s i mpl e phenome n on, I know i t  
no w.   Duri n g th e ma gic 
years  of chil dhood, t he a dult can do
 no wr ong a n d i f s o met hi ng happe ns  
bet wee n a c hild a nd a n adult t hat is wr ong, it ca nno
t be t he fa ult of t he adult .  And I was a ver y  
s mall, pi nt-si zed 12. 

Q: So your mother  wa s l i ving s epa rat ely 
from you obvi ousl y, s he wa
s working away fr om?  
A: Yes, she lived with the people 
t hat  she wor ked for out in the countr y.  I 'm not clear j ust exactl y  
where in England, she worked fo
r a Major Woodiwiss, who was a 
widower with I believe some  
childr en and she was expected 
to keep the house cl ean and 
t ake care of the children. 
Q: So you r e ally ha d no one clos e t o 
you that  you c oul d tal k to a bout t his?  
A: M y uncle  did come t o visit me . 
 He  had ma de it plain t o me t hat I could not stay wher ever he was  
stayi ng and I had the i m pression that
 he shi fted places to st ay every coupl e of days.  Thi s is what

ma kes me  think t hat he wa s ther e 
ill egall y.  Ther e was a small handful
 of Austrian socialists there  
who trie d to help e ach other a nd a pparentl y he 
woul d slee p with one fa mi
l y one ni ght or two a nd  
then move on and I di dn't
 tell him what happened to me.  
He could t ell quic kly enough that  
somet hing was out of whack but he di dn't know what, nor coul d he do much about it except that he

 for a man by the name
 of Leon Schalit, who

Ernst Pollit(ph) who helped 
my Dad, had to make al

to pass a medical ex

and _____ a nd doi ng a l ot of
 traveli ng on my own an
d c opi ng wit h a l o t of di ffere nt  situat ions, I  
have a clear recollection of arri
ving in Waterford, Ireland, late l
eaving, it was very dark, little misty, 
da mp, s oot y at the rail roa d stati on, the r e we re four 
or five tr ains  and hardl y a nybody got off the tr ain  
and this huge man stood there waitin
g for me,  a very ruddy face, fair
ly tight curled white hair, and 
he sai d, are you Bobby Tre uer, and 
I  said, ye s I a m, he s aid, I a m 
Mr. M ar sh, I ' m the headma ster of 
Ne wt own school, and he wrapped my  
hand i n his  big pa w a nd he le d me
 off, and I knew I was safe . 
I was s a fe not only i n that  place , I wa s sa fe with 
t ha t  ma n.  And Ne wt own sc
hool, whi ch had bee n i n  
existence, well now it's al
most 200 ye ars, t hey had al most gone
 out of busi ness by the 1920's , earl y 
'30's, so many schools of
 that ki nd did and M arsh, I later foun
d out had c o me along a nd said, i f you  
give me a fr ee hand, 
I will run the school and not 
take any salary until such

sense of commu nity, a

allowed to develop their own bents 
and abilities to the max.  A lot 
was expected, but it was within 
your own terms, it was the fi

time in my life 
that I had a taste of freedom, where I

was accepted and val ued as an i ndi vidual, encourag

fy mysel f .  And quit e  
literally, Newtown school and the Quak

 only saved my life  in
 that they saved me 
fr om deport ation, t he y s ave d my li fe  spiri t uall y. 
 Sta rted me  out on a  long
 journey of finding my  
own wort h.  Let 's t ake  a  break. 
Q: Okay. [pa use ] I j ust wante d to
 a sk about the inc ident at the s c
hool, when you were ra ped, did you 
know the per son well?   It wa s j ust
 the  second day you were  ther e. 
A: It was the second day I was th
ere, he was working in the kitc
hen and before I knew it, I don't  
know, I ca n't recall just how he got
 me into the me n's la
trine, I recall the latr
ine, smelly, narrow. 
After w ards I  felt t hat I ha d lure d hi m t here , and tha t
 coul dn't ha ve be en.  Th
at could not have be en. 
That  was my  recollecti on, that  
was my feeli ng at  the ti me. 

Q: Were  you abl e t o ma ke a ny frie nds  ther e, or  wa s it?  

A: No. 

Q: And you don't  really . . . 
A: I was a solitary, and agai
n I don't remember exactly 
how long I was there, it
 was, it had to have 
been a coupl e of weeks at least. 
 I remember Uncle Rich
ar d coming to get me 
on a Sunday to take 
me on an outing, he t o ok me  to H
yde Park, he tried to explain to
 me  people speaking on their 
soa pboxe s, I  wa s total l y _____ by th
en and he was reall y leaning on
 me hard t o lea rn Englis h, a nd 
constant ly l o oki ng over his shoulder
.  That  was a bad one , t hat wa s 
a ba d ti me .  And t he  da mn thi n g  
is that when you've bee n vi cti m
ize d , a nd es peci ally a s a  c hi l d a
nd you t ake it  on yoursel f , wha t  
happe ns i s you wi nd up l i ke as t h
ough you're wearing a 
ne on s ign on your fo
rehead, you assume  the 
victim personality and that makes you vulnerab
le and you get hit on ti
me and again, and it did  
happen time  and again. 
Q: So that  wasn't the only
 ti me, and was t hat repeat edly there or  was it j ust?

A: No , that wa s a on e ti me
 i nci dent t here, but t here are many fo
r ms of vict i miz ation.  I wa s sexuall y  
abused or assaulted or whatever 
you wa nt to call it on at least tw
o other  occ asions .  Not  in that  
school , but over s ubs eque nt yea rs.  And I think it ha
d less to do with my be
i ng physicall y small t han 
with my body langua
ge a nd how I fel t  about myse
lf.  I think that's commonp
lace for victi ms.  I 've 
had to do a  lot of wor k  on t hat , 
but it helps to talk about it, a
nd it my talking about it helps 
some body el se, I 'm gl ad t o 
do it.  I  ha ve t ake n four of my se ve n 
children back to Aust

the i nstr ucti ons  sai d, up to t he ei ght h month, a b or

month, kill the child.  
That  was  done t hrough s u ffoc ation,

Go d da mn i t .  Hell,  I wa nted my  
children to know

that  ther e was a ti me 
when i n fants wer e kill ed and t he chil dren were k

be safe.  And the rest of 
us ar e going to ha ve t o go ba ck, and we 'll all be
