ness

You have som uch to tell us ina short periodof  time.W e'll start.  You were just 
turning 11 when the Nazis overran Poland inSeptember
 
1939. T hewar cam e to you and your 
fam ily in Belgium  less than a year later in thespring of 1940.  Before you tell usabout your 
journey outof Europeand to the UnitedStates for safety, please tellusf irst abit about your 
fam ily, your comm unity, and
 
yourself  in the years before the war began.
 
>> Michel Margosis:  I don't know exactly wh ere to start. My f atherwas exiled to Siberia and 

he escaped. Hef ound his way to Palestine, butm y sister contracted 
P o lio
 
andthey could not 
take care of herthere. So tof ind a cure, whatever, Berlin, then Belgium , and thenaf ter that he 

tried to get back toPalestineand they would not let him  in. 
 
 
He tried andtried.  Finally
 
we settled inBelgium .  Ha
d  
we not 
s
et t
led there, I would 
notbea survivor today.  I figured at that time the Britishm andate in Palestine did not allow m e 
to use that system, I guess. And the Jewish agency wanted people to
 
--
 
rather than 
intellectuals.  My father becam e anewspaperm an atthe time. The last time he tried to 

comm unicate with them , the refugees from Germany andAustria tried to go to Palestine, too.  
So he was competing there.
 
 
So we stayed in Belgium .  That's where I hadm y education.  Even though m yfirst 
language was Russian
 
--
 
well, as you know, we had a very diverse fam ily with m y parents 
being born in the Ukraine andm y siblings in Persia and I was born in Belgium.  My parents 

spoke Yiddish toeachother.T hey spoke Russian to us. And we kids spoke French. Sowe 
had what's calleddiver sity today.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And today you co
-
lead theSpanish group and you're in the Italian group.

when I was here.
 
>> Michel Margosis:  You m entioned Persia. T hat's going to come up a little bit later. Explain 

the Persian connection in your fam ily.
 
>> Michel Margosis:  W ell,m y f ather was active.  He was in thepolicef orce.  But he was an 

active Zionist.  Hehad a well
-
known teacherwho indoctrinatedhim , I guess.  He escapedfrom  
the concentration camp in Siberia. I think itwas Kazakhstan.  Hem ade his way back allthe 

wa y to Palestine.
  
On the way, he went toPersia.
 
>> Bill Benson: W hatwe call Iran today.  Right?
 
>> Michel Margosis:  Yes.  Many people don't know that.
 
>> Bill Benson:  
Righ t .
 
>> Michel Margosis:  H e had a colleague
, a
 
Persian colleague
,  
whohelped him  to becom ea 
c it ize n .
 
>> Bill Benson:  Of Persia.
 
>> Michel Margosis:  Of Persia.  So now we have Persianpassports
,  
and he was able toget 
back and forth and able to travel
. W henI cam ehere, I was a Persian citizen.  I do not know a 
single word of  Persian.  I've never been there.  I never want to go there. 
 
 
[Laughter]
 
>> Bill Benson:  Ok. Tell us about your m other.
 
>> Michel Margosis:  She was a heroine.

grandparents, uncles,aunts, no cousins, until f inally about three years ago, one or two of them  
were able to come here.

September
 
1, of co u rse , Ge rm
any attacks Poland. You rem em ber your birthday quite vi vidl y 
f rom  that year.
 
>> Michel Margosis:  Septem ber
 
1, 1939,Germ any attacked Poland.  Septem ber
 
2 was m y 
birthday. T hat was the day that England andFrance gave anultimatum to Germ any which 

G e r m an
y ignored.  And on Septem ber
 
3,England and France declared war on Germ any.  That 
was a funny birthday present. About six m onths later Germany attacked Belgium  and Holland 

and Luxembourg
.  
Ithink 18 days later Belgium  surrendered. 
 
 
W et r i ed  t o t a ke
 
--
 w
e tried to go to the coast to get to England. W em issedthe train, 
luckily f or us. The ship that we wanted to take was sunk bef ore it even left. 
 
 
T he next available train
 
--
 
the railroad station was packed.  Outsidewere hundreds 
of  pe o p l e.  T he  ne xt tr

>> Michel Margosis:  W e walked;p
a cked  w
hatever we could within a f ew days af terBrussels 
was bom bed.
 
>> Bill Benson: W ereyou surroundedby thousands of othersf leeing Brussels? 
 
>> Michel Margosis:  W ell, by
 
the  time  we  go t to the  statio n
 
the station wasf ull.  I slept on m y 
su it ca se u
n t il th
enext m orning when we wer e f inally able to getaboard a train. 
 
 
T he train
 
--
 
stopped. The train, decided to goonfor seven days andseven nights to 
S
outhern France. It was bom bedonoccasion, strafedonoccasion.  And mostpeople that I 
speak to don't
 
know what straf ing means.  Airplanes,m achine guns. T he train stopped a 
couple of tim es.  Af ew people gotdown.  My father didnot let us offthe train.  He hidus under 
the seats
 w
here thebullets m ight ricochet. Som e people didnot make it back on th
e train, but 
the train kept going.  Andfinally we got down to Southern France.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So stop and starting seven days it took to makethat trip.
 
>> Michel Margosis:  W e weref ed through the window, people throwing f oodat us
, t

whatever. 
 
And that was pretty good.  Frenchbread is good. 
 
 
[Laughter]
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us
 
--
 
I think it was during this time when you were aware of  two Germ an 
spies being caught,I think. T ellus about that.
 
>> Michel Margosis:  T he f irst stop,a half
-
h our  
f rom  Brussels, the train was delayed because 
they stopped two nuns.  And the nuns, it was revealed
,  
were German spies.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Dressed as nuns.

it  
a 
little  b it. I d on 't kno w.  It wa s 
funny at
 
the time, but Ididn't know thatthe church was
 
--
 
I don't know m uch about it.  It was an 
interesting incident.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And there you areas an 11
-
year
-
old, you saw som e of  this.
 
>> Michel Margosis:  Oh, yeah.  And I remem ber it.
 
>> Bill Benson: 
 
So af ter the seven
-
day journey, you endup in a small town.
 
>> Michel Margosis:  A sm all town on the Garonne River, a big river.  W estayed therefor a 
while.  It was early spring.  I rem em berthef ields looking out once we stepped out of the town 
which w
as only about 10 m inutes f rom  the house
 i
nany direction, practically.  You saw nothing 
but grape, grape vines.  I learnedhow to appreciate grapes
 b
ecause I was thereday in and 
day outeating grapes.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Because I think already foodwas beginning to get scarce otherwise.
 
>> Michel Margosis:  It started to get scarce,yeah. W e still hadfood. 
 
 
Af ew days later, about two weeks later, France gave up and theVichy go vernment 
tookover.  [Inaudible]was a big hero inW orldW arI. The rations started to come in. My 
parents decided that we should getaway f rom  there. I hadaf riend who hadafarm  nottoof ar 
f rom  there.  So we wer e invited to join them  at thef arm  and stayed therefor a while.  My f ather 
received his visa to Portugal.  He hadhis papers.  He hada valid passport.  My m other's 
passport had expired, so we couldn't leave.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So just your father gets the visa.
 
>> Michel Margosis:  H e went toVichy, tried to get ticketsf or us and couldn'tm ake it.  He 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

decided that beca
useof  his writings against fascism  and Hitler
 
--
 
he kept warning the people 
about Hitler.
 
>> Bill Benson:  He was a journalist.
 
>> Michel Margosis:  Since 1933he kept upwith it.  Hef elthehada price on hishead,and he 
went to Portugal.
 
>> B ill B e n s o
n: W hy Portugal?
 
>> Michel Margosis:  It was the only country open.  Switzerland was notallowing anybody 
anym ore.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And Portugal was neutralat the tim e?
 
>> Michel Margosis:  Portugal was sort of  neutral.  
L
ike Franco.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Franco neutral.
 
>> Michel Margosis:  Franco becam e Francothehead of Spainbecausethe Germanand 
Italianshelpedhim . They provided weapons.  Basically Franco was af ascist.
 
 
Until we got there, they were sending ref ugees back to France. By the time we go
t 
there,they relented.  W ell, that came later, but the ally troops invaded North Af rica.  I think 
Franco saw the writing on the wall and started allowing refugees.  
And Balthazar
 
in Portugal 
was another fascist.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So yourfather lef t.
 
>> M i
chel Margosis:  H e stayed there.  He was stranded there because he couldn't go 
anyplace.  Finally placed him  ina sm all townin Portugal where refugees were placed.

:   W e we r e o n t he f a rm
f
or a while.  I learned things thatfarmers do

drive a team  of horses.  It wasf un.  I learnedhow to m ilk a cow

[Laughter]
 
But I was young.
 
>> Bill Benson:  12 years old at thistime roughly.
 
>> Michel Margosis:  It was an adventure. Itwas great. 
 
 
T hen m y m other decided there's no point to staying there
.  Shethought perhaps the 
Persians in Marseille m ight help.
 
>> Bill Benson: T he Persian ligationbecause you have Persian citizenship.
 
>> Michel Margosis:  R ight.  So we decided to go to Marseille. To go to Marseille we had to 

stop in Toulouse f irst to 
make thetrain connection. And we were told there was a reception 
centerfor ref ugees, so we signed in. W e were given f ood. W e were gi ven a bunk.
 
 
In them iddle of the nightm y m other didn'tfeel right about it. She decided to leave. 
T he barracks were
 
basically scrap tents, bottom  wood andthen tarps around it.W e lif ted the 
tarp and just sneakedout. 
 
 
T hrough the Museumm any years later Ifound out that that reception cam p was 
operatedby them ilitia, Frenchm ilitia, andthe people were arrestedand
 
shipped to Auschwit z.

is:   A s we  
go t
 
to Marseille, the bestplace we could f ind was justdown f rom

the cops would notfeel safe

>> Bill Benson:  It wasso rough.
 
>> Michel Margosis:  It was rough.  The Corsicans, Italians, Arabs, open, smoking Chinese 
next door. And I could comm unicate.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And this is a port city.  Right? 
 

>> Michel Margosis:  Marseille is the second largest city in France,the largest comm ercial 
ports. It's about asdiverse as it canbe.  I learned to do a lot of things there.

His father was f rom

you're in Vichy, France.  So ostensibly
 
it's f ree France but 
they're ver y m uch in collaboration with the Germ ans. W asthere aGerm an Army presence at

>> Michel Margosis:  W e didn't seethe Germ ans there.  My f riend, Raf ael, hisfather was 

black,f rom  Cam eroon.  Cameroon was German
 be
f oreW orldW ar I.  And we suspect

tha t 
he worked with them . He spoke English at hom e.  Hisf ather spoke German.  And he was 

French. 
 
W e did a little looking around, e
specially since I had the little kayak.  I could go 
around watching the coast, which Idon't talkm uch about.  But we did swim  there. T he other 

activities I don't talkabout.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And why don't you talk about them ? 
 
>> Michel Margosis:  It's personal.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Ok.
 
>> Michel Margosis:  T oo personal.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And as you said inthe past, nefarious activities.
 
>> Michel Margosis:  N ef ariousactivities.
 
>> Bill Benson:  As you said, the slum s were relativel y safe because they were so dangerous 

for the French
 
gendarm eries
 
andthe m ilitiato com e in there.  Youwere telling m e aboutwhat I 
think you call raff les.  Tell us about the raff les.
 
>> Michel Margosis:  One of the techniquesfor the people, well, on m y birthday af ter I left 
Belgium , theneighborhood was swept of  theJews.  And then on m y birthday af ter I left

Ma r
seille, the same thing happened. My neighborhood was cleaned.  But one way of  cleaning 
is to get the troopsononeend of the street and see them  at the other end of the street and 
picking up everybody that's inbetween.  Andif  youdon't have any documents to justif y your 
existence, you're out of luck. That's what's called a raff le.  It'sbasically a roundup.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Apeople trap, Ithink you referred to it.
 
>> Michel Margosis:  People trap.  And I was able to escape a couple of them .
 
>> B ill B
enson:  How did you dothat? 
 
>> Michel Margosis:  Som ehow houses are connected.  AndI was able to transferf rom  one 
house connecting to the outsideto theother. Leon is abetter city for that than Marseille. 
Marseille, theneighborhood that was particularly trapped,I knew pretty well.  M y f riend, 
Rafael,he lived ina section called the basket.  It was blown upabout threemonths after we 
left. The whole neighborhood was just blownup
, p
icked up everybody.  I 
don™t 
have a number 
of  how m any Jews wer e
 
picked up in there.  And the French were relocated.
 
>> Bill Benson: W asn't
 
--
 
was your brotherW ill y picked up in oneof the raff les? 
 
>> Michel Margosis:  My brotherW illy was picked up early on. That was pretty early af ter we 

got to Marseille. He was
 
picked up.  He wasparading with the people supporting G
eneral 
Degrelle.  He was picked up and released the next day.  Apparently the look on him , they 

would have noticed that he was Jewish.  I won't discusshow.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So hewas able to get away because of that.
 
>> Michel Margosis:  H e was able to get away.  And Ihardly ever saw m y sister or brother 
there.

years older.  My sister was f our years older. So we are different crowds.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Do you know if there were other Jews f rom Brussels that were also in 

Marseille at the same tim e who hadescapedthere like youhad?
 
>> Michel Margosis:  N o.  I don't know anybody f rom  Brussels, butm y m other hadaf riend.  

W ehad goodf riends who hada candy shop. W e weref riends with them.  My brother was in

>> Bill Benson:  So, Michel, at som epoint, though, your mother decides it's tim eto getoutof  

Marseille and she wants to go to Spain.

up in 
No rt h  Af ri c a
. T he Germ an troops cam e down.

T he Germ ans were m arching on the sam e street,the main street. And the sound of those

Same f or m y sister because of  her

T oulouse and theborder, we had German troops inour cabins. And m y m other couldn't speak 

French. She spoke Yiddishand Russian.  So she started signing.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Pretending.
 
>> Michel Margosis:  Pretending to sign. T heGerm ans never caught on. We caught on.  And 
we spoke French with a Southern French accent, very easily.  And then we responded. T hat

Eventually we relented because we didn'thaveany

Ibelieve today is about
 
$5 00, 0 0 0.

carried a French dictionary.  I don't know wh y. W hen I was in Marseille, I used to go to theold 
port where m yf riend was.  He lived there.T here was a book shop. I used to go there all the
