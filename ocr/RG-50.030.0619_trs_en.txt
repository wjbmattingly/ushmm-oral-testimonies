Question:  This is a United States Holocaust
 Memorial Museum in
terview with Cantor 
David Wisnia, conducted by Jo seph Toltz on Ap
ril the 7th, 2011, in Princeton Junction, 
New Jersey. It's a very great pleasure for me 
to be here to talk to you today, Cantor 
Wisnia, and I'd like you to  start by talking to  me
 about your back ground of training, your 
mu sical life and your fa
mily life leading up to 
the invasion in  '39.   
Answer:  Okay.  I think I might have an easie
r time if you would be 
asking questions,     
Q:  Okay.  Good.  Okay.    
A:     okay, because I don't know what I'm le
aving out, what specifically you would like.  
For instance, I was born    I have a problem there    1924, 1926. 

Q:  Yes.  

A:  I got my self so oriented to say 1926    or 
'24, I'm sorry, that that
's what I used when I 
came to Auschwitz. 

Q:  Right. 

A:  During the selectio n, I wa
nted to move over with the 
guys who were at least 18. 
Q:  Yes, of course, yes, so you were safe.  

A:  So... now, I'm still not sure.  I went back 
to Poland to find out my birth certificate in 
Sochaczew.  Forget it, can 't get it. 

Q:  Yeah.  
A:  We even  had a deal with a dedication of a 
cemetery in Sochaczew th
at I went back to.  
And we knew the mayor.  It didn't 
do any good.  There's no record s. 

Interv iew with Da v id Wisnia

Q:  Right, right.  
A:  So when my first    I   
 I was a member    of course, my
 father's name is Elijah.  My 
mother's name was Machla (
ph).  Lived with my family
 until I finished the Yavneh 
school system in Sochaczew. 

Q:  That was only primary school? 

A:  Yes.  Yavneh. 
Q:  Yes.  Yavneh was    was Hebrew and Polish? 
A:  Hebrew Polish.  No Yiddish was allowed.   

Q:  Right. 
A:  As a matter of fact, I distinctly remember 
having    I did something in Yiddish, I said 
a couple of word s, I had to 
write it down 500 times.  So it 
was a whole    the idea was 
design a school     
Q:  Uh huh.  
A:     you were going to learn modern Hebrew, period.   
Q:  Yes.  

A:  That's  it.   
Q:  Yeah. 
A:  So ev erything was in Hebrew
.  Every subject was in Hebrew. 
Q:  It was a private school.  
A:  As a result    private, oh, God, God.  
Q:  And exclusive? 

Interv iew with Da v id Wisnia 
 
5 
A:  And the reason    quite exclusive, for one 
reason, because you had to be ab le to afford 
it. 
Q:  Right. 
A:  Because people    as a matter of fact, I re
member we paid for    for other people too.  
We were sort of considered    you see, Pola
nd doesn't have a middle class, or never did.  
You were either wealthy or you were poor. 
 And, you'll pardon th e expression, piss poor. 
Q:  Yeah.  
A:  Most Jews were quite poor. 

Q:  Yeah.  
A:  Could not eek    barely eeked out a livi
ng.  My father was a businessman.  He had a 
place in Warsaw where he employed some peopl
e doing furniture.  I explained that to 
you, you know, like     
Q:  Yes, the upholstery.  
A:     upholstered, right,     
Q:  Yes.  

A:     for businesses.  He employed other 
people.  And my grandfather had a business in 
Sochaczew itself.  He was making these fancy 
caskets, you see, like you see this here. 
Q:  And these were    these were ca
skets not for Jewish 
funerals though.  
A:  These were    no, that's correct. 
Q:  Right. 

Interv iew with Da v id Wisnia 
 
6 
A:  And as it turned out, God must have l
ooked down upon
 the whole situation.  And 
because of one of these guys 
who worked for my grandfather, 
I was able to survive when 
I escaped from Warsaw.  He's the one who saved my life. 
Q:  Yeah.  So getting back     

A:  Yeah. 

Q:     to your family.  So 
you were    are you the youngest? 
A:  I was a member   
 no, I was a middle child. 
Q:  Okay .  So your other siblings? 

A:  There    one    my older brother    
there were three boys.  My elder brother was two 
and a half years older than I.  My younger 
brother was two and a half years younger than  
I. 

Q:  And you had sisters? 

A:  No. 
Q:  So it was just the three of you.  
A:  No.  Three.  Three  

Q:  And their names w ere? 
A:  The older one was Moshe.  Th
e younger one was Dov Berela (ph). 
Q:  Dov Berela.  It's
 always Dov Berela.  
A:  So...  well, it's  redundant, but what are you going to do. 

Q:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
A:  That's  if you want
ed to use Yiddish , so... 

Q:  Yeah, sure.  Now, tell me, then, how     

Interv iew with Da v id Wisnia

A:  We all went to that school. 
Q:  Right.  Is that where you found your love of mu sic, or was it earlier? 
A:  Well, no, the love of music came from my
 father.  My father was a big opera buff. 
Q:  Ah, right.  
A:  So I learned, believe it or not, E lucevan  
le stelle when I was nine years old.  I don't 
remember it anymore, but it's alw ays in my mind, so... 
Q:  Yeah, yeah.  
A:  Tosca.   

Q:  Yeah.  
A:  And    and when I came to Warsaw, you 
know, and I started with David Eisenstadt in 
the big choir, he's the one     he was 
so impressed with it, that was     
Q:  Yes.  
A:     you know, for a kid nine, ten years old. 
Q:  Yeah.  
A:  And I used to go into Warsaw quite ofte
n because my  father took me.  And I mu st say 
that I was probably favored among 
the three brothers because I was an ex     I was a good 
student, I was a top student in th e school in Hebrew.  I took th e Hebrew.  I had a very 

good ear for   
 for music.

food, they have

of it. 

Q:  Yeah.  
A:  He's going to let his kids...

Q:  But your brothers escaped? 
A:  My brothers, no, no, no, no, no. 
Q:  Okay .  
A:  My brothers were still w

Q:  Right. 

A:  As soon as we began he
aring and things got mu ch  wo rs
e, you know, as far as food 
was concerned, as far as money was concerne
d, my  father could not conduct any busin ess 
slowly, that    in November of 1940, we w
ill have a ghetto formed in Warsaw.  And we 
were lucky to have the    what do you call it,
 our building in the ghe
tto, right inside in the 
corner of the ghetto, wh ich was right next 
to the gate where the bridge was from one 
small ghetto to the large ghetto. 

Q:  Yes.  

A:  We were in the small one.  So my brother 
went to Otvosk.  That's
 where my family is 
from, my father's  side of the 
family.  Otvosk was down in, 
I'd say about 30 kilometers, 40 
kilometers.  That was the area where people us
ed to go for the summe
r, I mean, the ones 
who could afford it. 
Q:  Yes, like a __.  
A:  Like a line.  Right, right.  The whole Wisnia
 clan lived in that ar
ea.  So my father's 
brother.  And th at's where my  brother went to because it made it easier, because in the 
suburbs it was much 
easier to get food. 
Q:  Yes.  

Interview with David Wisnia 
 
22 
A:  In our    Warsaw, you had to  live by the ra
tions they gave you.  So  wh en th ey closed 
the ghetto, it was first staffed by gendarmerie, 
German gendarmes, not SS.  You see, they 
had     
Q:  Locals. 

A:  They  were planned.  It was planned. 
 Gendarmes, German gendarmerie.  German 
army.   
Q:  Uh huh.  
A:  No SS.  Everything was fine.  I was s
till going to school 
on occasion.  I don't 
remember if it was every day.  To Dluga we c
ould walk .  Trolley cars with stars of David 
on it.  So everything was still fi
ne until they attacked Russia. 
Q:  Yes. 

A:  '41. 

Q:  Yes. 
A:  June or July 22nd or 
something like that     
Q:  Yes.  
A:     1941. 
Q:  Yeah.  
A:  All hell broke loose after that.  We kn
ow    we saw there was something wrong 
because the army that was 
guarding the ghetto changed 
completely.  SS took over. 
Q:  Yeah.  Because the rest of the army, th
e normal army w
ould have been sent to the 
front.  

A:  That's  right. 

Interview with David Wisnia 
 
23 
Q:  Tell me, before we get into the     
A:  Yeah. 
Q:     the details of that particular period
, do you remember any cultural activity that you 
experienced in the ghetto     
A:  In the ghetto itself, yes.  

Q:     between '39 and '41? 
A:  Yes, yes.  As a matter of fact, I sang on
 the radio.  I sang on Po
lish radio.  I don't 
remember anymore what. 
Q:  Was that during the occupation? 
A:  Actually, it was    I must have my dates     
Q:  That must ha

A:  Yeah, must before, before. 

Q:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
A:  Before. 
Q:  But tell me, did you go to any theater?  
Because there was a thriving Yiddish  theater. 
A:  There was a Yiddish theater. 
Q:  And there was a Polish theater.  
A:  There was a    yes, we    we did un
    infrequently.  You see, they squeezed it. 
Q:  Yeah.  
A:  So it was a question of there were many 
people who had enough
 food, and majority 
of people did not. 
Q:  That's  right.  

Interview with David Wisnia 
 
24 
A:  So it started    I don't remember rea
lly details, but all I know, it was not a good 
situation. 
Q:  No.  
A:  We saw it was wrong. [cough] 

Q:  Gesundheit.  

A:  But the whole situation changed     
Q:  Yeah.  
A:     as soon as they attacked     

Q:  Yeah.  
A:     Russia. 
Q:  Yeah.  

A:  My father used to go out, as a matter of 
fact used to go out to the airport.  He knew 
carpentry because that was part of his     
Q:  His trade.  
A:  What do you call it?  Trade. 

Q:  Yes.  
A:  So he went to the airport and he befrie
nded one of the    the airport that was bombed 
the first day.  And there was the Luftwaffe se
rgeant over there who befriended him.  And 
he used to  bring home all kinds of goodies be
cause he used to do 
some work for him over 
there. 
Q:  Right. 

A:  Okay.  So everything was still fine.  

Interview with David Wisnia 
 
25 
Q:  Yes. 
A:  And each I think day or two days or three 
days a week, they used
 to have like a truck 
that used to come to th
e komena, komenda,     
Q:  Yeah.  

A:     okay, on Grzybowska, 
which was only about three bloc
ks away from us.  And they 
used to go by bus    by bus   
 by truck over to the airport.  
They  used to bring him back.  
Okay .  One beautiful day, I don't rememb er exactly wh en , I guess it mu st have been 

August or September of 1941.  My father di
d not feel exactly the greatest one mo rning, 
and he said why don't I go to th e airport.  Sa
me Wisnia.  By the way, because of that, I 
get paid from     

Q:  From the Germans     

A:     the German government,     

Q:     for being     
A:     would you believe it?   
Q:  Yeah. 

A:  They had the record
.  They have names. 
Q:  Yeah.  

A:  It's absolute
ly unbelievable. 
Q:  Yeah, yeah.  So you 
went to the airport.  
A:  I went to the airport to work. 

Q:  Yeah.  

A:  When I came back     

Interview with David Wisnia 
 
26 
Q:  Everyone was gone.  
A:  Let alone was everyone, I couldn't get in
to the house, the whole block.  There's no 
record of this anywhere.  They tried    
from what I found out fro
m the people when I 
finally got the word to our 
section, it's called (falitsuv?
) Krochmalma.  Okay.  Our 
build ing, 43, I couldn't get over to the building.
 Why?  Because I heard there was    was 

all blocked off by, what do you call it, Polish po
lice, Yiddi     Jewish police, SS on the 
outsk irt, because they tried what they call rese
ttlement.  So used to dr
ive in with a truck, 
give a square block or a 
building or two buildings 
   do you follow me?  
Q:  Yeah.  

A:     a certain number of minut
es to pick up their belongings. 
Q:  And get out.  
A:  And get out.  They were going to 
take them    this was the     
Q:  Like a (schpira?)  
A:     talk    this was the talk of resettlement. 
Q:  Yes, yes.  And I assume that your family a
ll went to Treblinka.  Or was it Treblinka     
A:  They weren 't going.  Th
ey weren 't going anywhere. 
Q:  Yeah, no.  

A:  They just tried to find 
out how long it was going to  take.  Because they didn't take 
anybody.  That must 
have been a trial. 
Q:  Oh.  

A:  But my father, if I remember    if I kno
w    if I rememb er my father, he was a wise 
guy.  He probably wouldn't listen to them. 

Interview with David Wisnia 
 
27 
Q:  Yes.  
A:  You follow?  
Q:  Yeah.  
A:  I found my father, 
my mother    this is
 tough.  Oh , dammit. 
Q:  Do you want to 
stop?  We can stop.  
A:  [sobbing]  I'm sorry. 
Q:  It's okay.  That's o k ay. 
A:  Ahhh.  I finally made it 
into the building.  And on th
e outside, there was a group of 
corpses.  I found my  
 my  mo ther __.  I didn't know what to do.   
I'll be all right. 

Q:  Yeah, yeah. 

A:  I didn 't think it would still do it to me. 

Q:  Yeah. 
A:  And I ran.  I didn 't  know what to do, 
I didn't know wh ere to 
go. I remembered across 
the street from our house, ther
e used to live on 44 Krochmalna
 two Polish girls.  It wasn 't 
a Jewish area. 

Q:  Yeah.  What were their names?  
A:  Only I know the first.  I 
wish I knew their last name.  I'
ve been searching for them for 
60 years and was never able to find th
em.  Vonda (ph) and Yadja (ph).   
There were two young girls on the first floor.  We
 were very friendly.  Used to play, used 
to     anyway, I tried desperately to rememb
er where I knew that Vo
nda    they had to 
move out, you know, when
 the ghetto was formed. 

Interview with David Wisnia 
 
28 
Q:  Yes, of course, because.    
A:  I knew they moved to Praga     
Q:  Yeah.  
A:     which was a suburb of Warsaw. 

Q:  Yeah.  Non Jewish. 

A:  And the other side not    of course.  Of
 course.  Non Jewish.  And I made it.  I took a 
trolley car.  Nothing.  I didn't know 
really what the hell I was doing, so... 
Q:  Sure. 

A:  So I got out of here.  I had to get away
 from here.  So I figured maybe they want to 
kill the whole area or whatever was going to 
happen, I didn't know.  So I made it to the 

place, to Praga where she was.  I knew that 
Vonda, the older one  
  she was about two 
years older I guess than I    was working as 
a waitress in a restaurant in Praga.  I knew 
that from before; how, I don 't remember. I we
nt there, she was working.  She saw me 
through the window.  She motione
d to me to wait in the little 
garden there.  She finally 

came out. What are you doing?  What are you 
doing here?  I told her my family is no 
longer.  I says, I have to get out of here.  
She says, Where do you want to go?  I says, I 
want to go to Sochaczew.  I di
dn't even think fast.  There 
were no Jews in Sochaczew.  
Why the hell was I going to go to
 Sochaczew?  I figured I had to get away from here.  So 
she at the end of it took 
me to the train statio n. 
Q:  Uhhuh.  

A:  Bought my  ticket to So chaczew.  Put me on th e train.  And I went to So chaczew.   

Interview with David Wisnia 
 
29 
Okay.  I came to Sochaczew.  We had a big thr
ee story    actually threeandahalf story 
apartment house in Sochaczew that my grandfat
her and father together as partners built. 
Q:  Yes. 

A:  I didn't know there was cu
rfew.  Was in the middle of the night.   It was about 11 
o'clock at night that I got to the station 
in Sochaczew.  I walked 
from the station to 
Staszica, w h ich was the street where our build
ing was.  And as I approach ed, somewhere 
I guess    how could I think straight, anyway
, at that point.  I see th e facade of the 
building is still there at 17 Staszica Street. 
 B u t the whole inside 
is burned out.  The 
Germans burned out all the Jewish buildings. 
 Only the skeleton re
mained.  You know 
what I'm talking about? 

Q:  Yes, yes, yes.  

A:  I reached closer, there's no    nobody ther
e.  I started knocking
 on doors.  I knew all 
the Christians there.  Remember, I grew up there. 
Q:  Yeah, yeah.  You    you    you were     
A:  And we were very, very friendly an
d everybody knew my  grandfather    

Q:  Sure.  
A:     and father. 
Q:  And you were a personality    

A:  Well     
Q:     musically. 
A:     but the Christians even knew that. 

Q:  Yeah, yeah. 

Interview with David Wisnia

A:  So I started with the    you know wh at a mangel (ph) is? 
Q:  Yes, yes. 
A:  I knocked on the door of Schmiguelska 
(ph).  I'll never forget.  She says, Davidek, 
she says.  Little David.  She says, Get out of 
there.  There are some Germans over here.  I 
can't do anything fo r you.   
I sat there, I want to stay overnight.  Anyw
ay , I started moving ar
ound to some people 
until finally somebody took me in. 

Q:  And this     

A:  A person by the name of Prusky. 
Q:  Right. 
A:  P R U S K Y or I.   I used
 to play football with the kids
.  She took me in, the mother, 
and gave me some food.  And 
what happened, I told her the story.  She says, David, you 
can 't stay here because in this building 
there are some Germans and they're going to 
denounce you, they 're going to  ki
ll you and kill me too.  So    but, she says, you know 
who lives around the corner fro
m here, she says, and she told
 me how to go.  There's a 
fellow by the name of Milesky, Vladik (ph). 
 He knows you since you were a kid.  He 
used to work for your grandfathe
r.  I found Vladik.  And I'll 
never forget that man.  If you 
talk about a righteous gentile.  
When he found    he cried hi
s heart out when he found, he 
says    he says    he walked out of his wood
en bed that he had.  He says, You sleep here.  
I'll sleep on the floor.  I'll never forget that
.  In the morning, he 
says, I'm gonna take you 
across the bridge.  The Bzura River is there, ri
ght there in Sochaczew .  B Z U R A.  Take 
you across the bridge.  It's guarded  by gendar
mes, Ger m ans.  He sa

you call it ?  The poy     the poylish, you 
know.  He says nobody    and besides, 
I was blond anyway, so...H

across the border.  He says, It's about five m
iles from here.  I'll take you    you have a 
cousin living in the ghetto in Czerwins
k.  That 's how I got to Czerwinsk. 
Q:  Right. 
A:  He led me across the border. 
Q:  Uh huh.  
A:  I'll never forget when I saw the first  
  I'm  trying to remember, w as Friday night.  I 
saw candles in the window and I walked ove
r, knocked on th e first door wh en I got into  
Wyszogrod, which is the town 
before     right after the border.  He went back to 
Sochaczew, and I     he told me to go to Czerwi
nsk.  He said it's onl
y about a kilometer or 
two from here.  And you have a cousin  over ther
e.  You'll be able to stay in the ghetto.  
It's okay.  Because I didn't know.  It was.   
I came to the first house and I knocked on th
e door.  And when I op
ened up the door, I 
saw the picture of Jesus in the __ and I said, Oh
, my God. I didn't  know what to say.  You 
know, you're supposed to say certain things
 when you walk into 
somebody's house in 
Poland, particularly (fabrenta?)
 Catholics, really.  And I  
  I don't know how I excused 
myself.  I says, I need to go   
 my  Polish is fluent, of course. 
 Big deal .  It's my language. 
Q:  Sure. 

A:  So I go to, what do you call 
it?  I want to go to  Czerwi
nsk.  Sh e mu st have realized 
that I was Jewish.  So she told
 me how to go and I went to C
zerwinsk.  The only problem    

Interview with David Wisnia 
 
32 
to cut this story short, the problem when  I got
 to Czerwinsk, I didn
't have any papers.  
And in a ghetto particularly, this was

A: And Nowy Dwor was strictly a resettlement
 operation where each 
week we didn't stay 
very long in Nowy Dwor.  Afte

ansports that they gathered 
from the whole area, and that was Germany, 
remember.  That was Œ that was Germany

Q:  Yes, yes. 

A:  They  started sending th e people, you know, on trains. 

Interview with David Wisnia

Q:  That's  elderly --  

A:  -- or 16.  
Q:  Yeah. 
A:  -- that's elderly.  Then 
Figulea (ph) went.  She wanted me, I was almo st tempted to go 
with her, because she needed 
somebody to take her.  Her hus
band had died quite awhile 
back.  So I was sort of lik
e the protector, and I don't know, for wh atever reason, my  
friend, who lives in Israel now in Haifa, w
ho was with me, whose numb er is two numb ers 
higher than mine -- mi ne is 83526; his is
 83528 -- came on th e same transport.  I knew 
him from Warsaw, Zlotnick, Zol

ng now in Haifa, still living 
in Haifa, and he said, don't -- don't go.  You stay
 for the last transport.  You'll go with us.   
That was my  buddy.  So  I let her go by hersel

found out later, they 
went to Heiligenbeil.  They
 never even had a chance -- 
Q:  No, no, no.

Q:  Yep, yep. 

A:  Okay.  Look, when you 'r

 rights, of your life -- 
Q:  You forget, yeah. 

A:  -- you forget.  You don't think in those term

educated, most erudite 
people you can think of in Europe. 
Q:  Yeah.  Why would they be doing th is. 
A:  They'r e going to kill little childr

 to kill women? 
Q:  Yeah, yeah.

Q:  Yeah, yes, 
yeah, packed in. 
A:  All right.  We finally -- we tried to 
get up there and see, l
ook where we were.  We 
knew we were going on the side lines of 
Warsaw.  We knew we were going somewhere 
to the east from Nowy Dwor, but we certai
nly didn't know th at we were going south. 
Q:  Yeah, yeah. 

A:  Okay.   

Q:  Yeah. 
A:  When we were -- I think so mebody yelle
d out he saw some kind of an erad am  
(?indecipherable?) I think they saw. 
Q:  Yes. 
A:  Which meant going south, but wh
o the heck knew.  We didn't know. 
Q:  Yeah. 

Interview with David Wisnia 
 
39 
A:  We arrive in Auschwitz-Birkenau.  On th
e siding of the train there when we arrive, 
you know, the old ru sh job, you 
know, where the SS, you know -- 
Q:  The dogs -- 
A:  -- beating you, get over here
 with the dogs with the guy 
with -- where I thought it was  
Mengele.  It wasn 't Mengele yet.  Mengele ha
dn't been there yet.  I found that out after. 
Q:  Yeah. 
A:  But it was a guy who lo oked  like, you know
 -- I says I will never forget the boots for 
heaven 's sake.  I heard somebody say in Germ
an -- and I understand German.  I learned  
German, (?a lieb en achsen sin lager.?)  I didn'
t understand wh at the hell that me ant.  And 
they start separating the men.  There were still 
lots of women and lots
 of children.  There 
mu st have been about 1,500 people.  That 
was the last transport 
from Nowy Dwor.  Men 
get over to the right.  Yeah
, the women over to the left
 going on trucks.  Women, 
children, young kids.  I almost
 went over to them.  You k
now, I figured well, what the 
hell. 

Q:  Yeah. 

A:  All right. 
Q:  Yeah. 
A:  But I learned my  lesson in don't expect 
any good th ings from the 
Germans.  So if you 
can walk, fine, and particularly, I moved my self
 over to the side of the men, lined up in 
fives, and this guy, about three rows of five
s, an SS man leads us
 in.  They go away 
immediately, the men -- not the fu ll, whatever
 went in.  I found out of course from my  

Interview with David Wisnia 
 
40 
book, out of the 1,500 who came in, 570, wh
ich was a high numb er, because there were 
mostly men, you follow me, younger -- 
Q:  Younger feet. 
A:  That was the last transport, on their feet, right.  

Q:  Yeah. 

A:  -- went into the camp -- 
Q:  And that was -- 
A:  -- selected there and the 
rest of them went on trucks. 
Q:  Trucks. 
A:  Now, we don't know from nothing.  As a 
matter of fact, what's h is name, Zlotnick  
(ph), my  buddy, his sister was about two ye
ars older than him, a gorgeous tall girl, 
although, they didn't  take any 
women from that transport.   
Q:  Yeah. 
A:  Okay .  They  ride off into a little forest
 over there.  That was a little white house.   
Some of the guys who came in 
with their wives, with their 
families, you know, wanted to 
find out after we got in , wh ere are the women? 
 Where are the children?
  So the prisoners 
started to laugh at them.  So you see that big 
fire out there, outside of the perimeter of the 
camp?  They're dead.  There's th
e machine gun them to the best
 of my knowledge, first.   
Q:  Yes. 

A:  And then  burn th em in pyres of wo od wi
th wh atever they did, and I think after about 
two or three months, the crematoriums were
 finished.  We were building -- we were 
helping to build  
the crematoriums. 

Interview with David Wisnia 
 
41 
Q:  Yep.  So  were you processed in Œ in -- 
A:  I was processed in Birkenau. 
Q:  Yep 
A:  Immediately. 

Q:  Yep. 

A:  We went into a -- we were tattooed. 
Q:  Tattooed, head sh aved? 
A:  That's  right. 

Q:  Yep. 
A:  Tattooed, everything --  
Q:  And all the hair shaved? 

A:  All the hair shaved -- 

Q:  Yep. 
A:  And we went into th e sauna. 
Q:  Deloused -- 

A:  For regular Œ regular -- we didn't know. 
Q:  Yeah, yeah.   No.  Ther
e was no gas at that stage? 
A:  No, we received Œ no, there was no gas yet. 
Q:  Yeah. 
A:  We received the -- what do
 you call it, clo thing, whatever. 
Q:  Whatever you could get. 

Interview with David Wisnia 
 
42 
A:  You were a big guy, you ge
t short clothes.  You're a short guy, you get big -- like in 
the Army. 
Q:  Big shoes, small shoes. 
A:  Okay.   

Q:  Yep. 

A:  So with wooden clogs.  That was the wo
rst, those heavy wooden -- I don't know if 
you've ever seen them -- 
Q:  Yeah, I have. 

A:  They call them
 the Holland -- 
Q:  Yeah. 
A:  No sock s.  

Q:  In winter. 

A:  Oh, used to rub on here, 
terrible, terrible.  You coul
d hear Œ you could hear you 
co min g  from ten  mil e s  away . 

Q:  Yeah. 

A:  You know, clank.  So an yway, we're assig n
ed to cell block 15, mu st have been about  
450.  The rest of them I think went to a 
different -- I don't know where -- or ma ybe the 
whole 570, I don't know, went in
to that particular -- in cell block the altestewayouzef (ph)   
This was the Polish -- 
Q:  The Polish -- 

Interview with David Wisnia 
 
43 
A:  He gave us a talk when  
we got in there and each one 
got -- we got four men sleeping 
in one of those, either four or five.  I do
n 't know, some of them were five.  I always 
managed to get one on top -- 
Q:  Good idea. 

A:  -- immediately.  Sure.  I wanted to be 
on top.  So  and I was only, I would say about 
two or three days, I was like every other pr
isoner, because I was assigned to the job of 
cleaning, you know, picking up
 the bodies from the ditch. 
Q:  Yes.  These are people who had committed suicide? 

A:  Committed suicide, right. 
Q:  By electrocuting themselves? 
A:  Yes --well, what they did know -- let's 
say this is the perimeter of the camp, right? 
Q:  Yep, yep. 

A:  A trip wire, okay, with just a little trip
 wire, a ditch, electri
fied by a wired fence, 
sentry box.  So not that they
 n e ed ed  an  ex cu se.  A n ybo dy  w a
nted to commit 
suicide, very 
easy.  You put your foot over 
that trip wire, which means y
ou're trying to escape.  The 
guy would shoot you from the sentry box. 
 Many of them, that's
 w h at the German 
transport did, about two months later, when
 they found out what
 was going on there. 
Q:  Yes. 
A:  So th at was my  job for the first couple of
 years [sic],  to put th
e bodies together on 
two, three guys, you know, heap  on a wago
n, a wooden wagon, bring it over to a 
particular cell block, line up and then it we
nt to the crematorium where, crematorium Œ 
not the crematorium, the pyre 
of woods where they did them. 

Interview with David Wisnia 
 
44 
Q:  The pyre, yep. 
A:  I only did this for about I think eight or nine days. 
Q:  Okay . 
A:  Maybe two week s. 

Q:  Yep. 

A:  Not even that.  One nigh
t after coming from work in the 
afternoon, the blockalteste:   
Is there anyone here who sings?    

(?Indeciperhable?) 

Sing.  You sing. Everybody, hey, Wisnia, ge
t down.  Sing.  I get down from my booksa 
(ph).  There was a place about the size of this, 
the middle of the regular tiers of beds, of 
those wo oden booksas (ph), and that was right 
there.  There was a door to a special room 
for the blockalteste,  who was -- he 
was the boss of life and death really. 
Q:  Yep. 
A:  And I sang.  From that mo me nt on, my  life changed. 
Q:  What did you sing? 

A:  Buy me a (?undeciperhable?).  Joseph,
 Joseph, won't you ma
ke your mind up.  
Q:  Uh-h uh. 

A:  Hebrew, what did I do?  He 
couldn't  care less, as long -- 
Q:  Didn't matter what it was? 
A:  Didn't matter what it was. 
Q:  As long as -- 

A:  I sang. 

Interview with David Wisnia 
 
45 
Q:  -- you entertained him? 
A:  I sang. 
Q:  Anything in  Po lish? 
A:  Yeah, sure. (?undeipherable?)  Oh , he 
loved that.  That was very popular.  I knew 
every song.  This was my life. 

Q:  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
A:  So from that mo ment on, he says, okay,
 tomo rrow you're not going to  that job.   
You're going to stay right here 
in the -- it was like a revelation. 
Q:  And you were the stubendienst? 
A:  I became a stubendienst.  Actually, I 
couldn't become a stubendienst because the  
stubendienst had some pull from somebody. 
 So I became the assistant to the 
stubendienst.   
You talk about -- wh at do you ca
ll it, protect ya.  Oh, God. 
Q:  Yeah, yeah. 

A:  Then  they came to select peopl
e for the various commandos, you follow? 
Q:  Yep. 
A:  I don't rememb er how often I went out to
 work .  I didn't go out to wo rk very often, 
but the greatest privilege was when it came 
to  the roll calls, b
ecause remember, it was 
cold as hell all the time. 
Q:  And that went for hours? 
A:  Hours.  People used to die standing th ere. 

Q:  Yep. 

Interview with David Wisnia 
 
46 
A:  So.  And they count -- they
 didn't now how to count.  They  didn't have a system.  If 
you read -- what's a her name, Tippy's book, you'
ll see.  She's got it tagged right.  They 
had no sy stem. 
Q:  Yeah. 

A:  They needed the prisoners 
to help them with the system. 
Q:  Uh-h uh. 
A:  That's  why they  have a stubendien st, a 
kapo, a blockalteste, you follow, and if were 
you in with these -- 

Q:  You were in? 
A:  You were in. 
Q:  Right. 

A:  And my job, and I really -- believe me, if 
I ever prayed always one more day, let me,  
I've got to -- but I'll tell you something.  Y
ou know, somebody just 
asked is me , to what 
do I attribute my  survival at one of my  spee
ches.  It took me a long time to figure it out, 
but I knew the first day wh en I got undressed in
 front of the sauna before we went in for 
the shower, I was standing
 in front of an SS man who was a
bout 6'6.  My ey es fixed in to 
his belt buckle.  You can imagine how tall he was.
  To me it looked that tall, right?  This 
is in front of the sauna.  I'll never forget this 
as long as I live, and I look in, and what does 
it say on the belt buckle -- you won't believe this
 -- I don't know if you ev er heard that,  
Gott mit uns.  Okay.  God is with us. 

Q:  Is with us, yes. 

A: Swastika here -- 

Interview with David Wisnia 
 
47 
Q: Yeah. 
A:  -- in the middle and then SS insignia on th
e side.  I swear I looked in there, and for a 
second I had to hold  my self back from laughing. 
 I says you son of a bitch -- I didn't  say 

that.  I said not the God I learned about.  
I'm going to do everythi
ng in my life to outlive 
you. 

Q:  Yep, yep. 
A:  I already saw what was going on there,
 and from that moment on, you will not 
believe, I said to my self, 
750 Grand Concourse, Br
onx, New Yo rk; 723 Gates Avenue,  
Brooklyn, New York.  Right.  I di
dn't have any pencil.  I didn't  have anything.  I used to 
be the fancy writer in the house -- in my  hous
e.  So every time we had -- my mother had 
two sisters here in the States.  One of them 
who came in the first wo
rld war, elder sister, 
who lived  on the concourse in New Yo rk, an
d the other one who le
ft about six months 
before the war broke out.  Her 
younger sister came to her.  
She took her down  befo re the 
war.  Her name was H elen Borenstein (ph).  
That play ed  quite a trick on me because I 
screwed up the addresses.  
Wait till you hear this one. 
Q:  Wait for the purse war thing, but yeah. 
A:  Yeah. 
Q:  So that was -- so that was the preservation -- 

A:  The preservation Œ 
Q:  In your Œ in your -- 
A:  What gave me -- 

Q:  In your mind. 

Interview with David Wisnia 
 
48 
A:  And I'll tell you something, wh at gave me
, at that moment, I says, it's not what I 
learned.  No, God isn't with them, not the 
God that I know.  I'm 
going to try to outlive 
you.  I did. 
Q:  Abso lutely. 

A:  I did.  And you know, I used -- somebody 
asked me why do I come in with it now.  I 
had -- I told that story before but I deliver
ed a speech about three months ago, four 
months ago over here at -- where my  granddau
ghter lives.  The teachers wanted me to 
come and tell them ab out World War II.  Okay.  
I came in and one of 
the kids -- you want 
to hear?  This is incredible. 
 All assemb ly of the high school, one of the kids gets up Œ 
and I'm pretty good at geogra
phy.  So I walked over.  I wa
nted -- I like to show them, 
how did so many Jews get there, to Poland, 
and I'm a history buff.  
So I know the history 
of the Jewish people. 

Q:  Yeah. 
A:  Okay.  And I like a -- what do you call --
 a blackboard, and I draw Poland, show th em 
how the Jews got from the -- after the Spanish Inquisition.  It's incredible, and I'll tell 
you, that's  better than any 
history book, and I show th em 
exactly where Auschwitz was, 
where Warsaw was, where I lived, right, and I 
tell them after I finish -- I wasn 't even 
finished.  On e of the kids gets up, I as
k -- I lo ve to ask, "Any questions?"  
One kid, sitting there, gets up and says, "S
ir, if there was something what made you 
really survive all this?"  I sa
ys, well, it's not easy to give you an answer, I says, but I 
prefaced it by telling, "Look, this is a public sc
hool.  I'm not going to  tell you, but I had a 

very good religious backgro
und."  I said, "By religious 
I don't mean Orthodox, but I 

Interview with David Wisnia 
 
49 
know Œ I know my  history," I says. And all I learned is something that made me -- the 
first moment I got in there I to
ld them this story of being 
Œ of looking in to this SS man's 
middle, right, and seeing Gott mit uns.  Listen
 to this, the kid gets up and says, "You 
know my  grandfather" -- this could have been
 -- I tell you, I couldn't have planned it any 
better.  "My grandfather came here from the Ukra
ine and he had one of
 those, and it says 
Gott mit uns" -- listen to this -- "one of th
ose belt buckles.  We erased the swastika and 
the SS, but Gott mit uns is still on 
there."  I almost flipped out. 
Q:  What did you say? 

A:  I didn't know.  I didn't know -- I didn't sa
y a word  because I was afraid.  I was really 
hesitant.  I says -- 

Q:  Yeah. 

A:  -- what happens if his grandfather was an SS man? 

Q:  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
A:  How did he get Œ how did 
he get this belt buckle?  Did 
he get it from -- I'll tell you, 
the people there, I couldn't have said anythi
ng better in my whole speech, because it lent 
credence to what I told. 

Q:  Yeah.   
A:  It was unbelievable.  That's why I'm tellin g you this. 

Q:  That's  amazing.  Actua
lly, that's an amazing -- 
A:  This just happened about two months ago.  

Q:  Wow. 

Interview with David Wisnia 
 
50 
A:  Over at the -- what do you call it?  
Pennington High School. 
 Unbelievable.  So 
anyway, it did the trick. 
Q:  Yeah, yeah. 
A:  Yes. 

Q:  So now back to after you were doing th is
 job for -- after -- I mean after you became 

the assistant to the stubendeinst. 
A:  Yeah. 
Q:  And -- 

A:  I got the job in the sauna. 
Q:  Yeah. 
A:  The(?undecipherable?). 

Q:  That was the next job? 

A:  Yeah. 
Q:  What were you -- 
A:  They selected me. 

Q:  Yes. 
A:  I was -- we used to use the Zy
klon B gas to gas the clothing.   
Q:  Uh-h uh. 
A:  You follow me? 
Q:  Yeah.  
A:  In the sauna. 

Q:  To disinfect. 

Interview with David Wisnia 
 
51 
A:  In the old sauna, disinfections, right. 
Q:  Yes. 
A:  So we used to put on a 
gas mask.  We had an an SS  man by the way who was a very 
decent guy.  He brought us into -- I looked fo
r him at the end of the war.  I couldn't find 
him. 
Q:  What was his name , did you know? 
A:  George, his firs
t name, that's all. 
Q:  That's  all, yeah. 
A:  He became friends with the kapo of the -- 
Q:  Of your -- of your -- 
A:  Of the sauna. 

Q:  Yeah 

A:  And I have pictures of the kapo of the 
sauna with other people,  but I don't have a 
picture of him.  I looked for him, because 
we knew wh en Debruekfeld (ph), he used to 
come and give us all the political -- 

Q:  All the news? 
A:  Oh, yeah.  
Q:  Yeah. 

A:  And he knew.  He knew.   
Q:  Yeah. 
A:  He came back one day and told
 us that his job was to pour  
in the gas -- 

Interview with David Wisnia 
 
52 
Q:  Into the top. 
A:  -- in crematorium num
ber two from the outside. 
Q:  Yeah. 

A:  And he said, "I'm  not goin g to do it anymore."  He starte
d to throw up, and he said,  
"I'm going to probably not be he
re.  They're g o ing to send me
 to the Russian front."  He 
was scared to death.  They never did.  He 
never did it after that.  Okay.  So there were 
decent, of course -- 

Q:  Of course.   

A:  -- there were decent.  
Q:  Otherwise, you wouldn't  have survived . 
A:  Never, never. 

Q:  No one could have survived  -- 

A:  No, no -- 
Q:  -- by themselves? 
A:  -- not with that a system, correct, correct. 

Q:  It's not possible, no. 
A:  Abso lutely, absolutely. 
Q:  So -- so now, there was -- I want to 
move on to  the time -- I don't know how mu ch 
further this was when you fell asleep 
and didn™t Œ and weren't up for apel. 
A:  This was -- I was alrea
dy wo rking in th e sauna.   
Q:  Uh-h uh. 

Interview with David Wisnia 
 
53 
A:  I don't know how lo ng, months.  I   can
't  tell you th e exact dates, but anyway, you're 
only dealing with ab out two and 
a half years, anyway, period. 
Q:  Sure, sure. 
A:  So I know when  this happened.  There 
was one chamber that was a dry chamber in 
that sauna, okay, in the old sauna build ing.  
Okay.  There was a place where we used to 
gas the clothes, a place for showers, because 
the prisoners used to come in about once a 
month or wh atever, you know, for lousing. 
Q:  Yes, delousing.  

A:  You know. 
Q:  Yeah. 
A:  Delousing or wh atever. 

Q:  Yeah. 

A:  Right.  Delousing, right.  I should get 
it right, because lousing is different.  Okay .  
Sundays -- it was a Sunday.  It was very warm
 in that chamber, and the guys who wo rked  
there, there were about three or four other fell
as, okay, went in after the morning roll call.  
We had a morning roll call, the apel, which 
was less than a few mi nutes, and the 1:00 
o'clock was the big apel.  Wisnia goes to sleep 
there, and I wake up.  It got so quiet.  It 

mu st have been about 10 after 1:00 and there's 
nobody in there.  I 
look out the window of 
the sauna and I can see (?indecipherable?) the 
general, with his desk, in the middle of the 
road of Birkenau. 
 The whole camp is standing at atte
ntion so to speak.
  They're looking 
for Wisnia.  You can imagine. 
 They didn't  know yet who it wa
s, but they knew there was 
one -- 

Interview with David Wisnia 
 
54 
Q:  Missing. 
A:  -- person missing.  When I woke up -- 
Q:  Well, the number actually.   
A:  Hmm? 

Q:  It would have been  the number. 

A:  One number, yeah, yeah. 
Q:  The number. 
A:  They  had to get the number.  They  knew 
what cell block, because we stayed all on the 

outside lined up.  There was so
me body missing from that cell block.  I woke my self up, 
and I see everybody, and I started to run fr
om the sauna, from here
 all the way through 
the barracks, the side of the barracks down 
to cell block 15, wh ich is on th e left, and I 
tried to hide in between the people, but they
 wouldn't let me, because they already fo und 
out there was somebody missing there.  You can imagine. 
Q:  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
A:  You talk about luck. 

Q:  Yeah. 
A:  The SS man who is doing th e count comes 
over to cell block, blockalteste tells him 
that, you know, this 
is the fella's here. 
Q:  He's arrived? 
A:  Brings me up to the center road.  There'
s the desk with the ge
neral taking the count, 
right, from all the cell blocks.  You realize,
 there mu st have be
en 50,000
, 40,000 
prisoners.  I'm talking about men, just men.
  The women's camp  is on th e other side. 

Interview with David Wisnia 
 
55 
Q:  Yeah. 
A:  Okay.  He takes me, and guess who is 
the SS man reporting to the -- what do you call 
it? 

Q:   The one who drops the canisters in? 

A:  No.  George. 

Q:  George, that's  what I mean, yeah. 
A:  George. 
Q:  The one who was -- who was your -- 

A:  George is the SS man who is taking me over there. 
Q:  The sauna. 
A:  And he winks to me.  I'm standing next to
 the ditch, it was sort 
of like water, with his 
gun in one hand and with his 
hook, like a me a t hook, and he 
goes over to me, an d says,  
"You make one move and you're 
dead," and there's the general 
standing right there.  He's  
saying it for his benefit.  He's winking to me
.  Okay.  I didn't move.  All right.  I knew I 
was  in trouble.  I immediate -- I knew that was the end.  I got sick after that, right, a 

couple of -- I had a regular trial in the 
schreibsteube, you know
, where they do the 
records and I was sent in 
for three -- to three months in th e strafkommando. 
Q:  Which is hard labor? 

A:  Which is -- it's  like -- I'll tell you, it's a --
 they would have kille
d -- if it was anybody 
else, they would have killed them
 immediately.  They just woul
d have shot them.  Okay.   
I could see it.  He's like punching me or 
-- I'm standing up, figu
red oh-oh, Wisnia you 
really did it now.  About -- I got -- I don't kno
w if you call it typhoid.  They put me in cell 

Interview with David Wisnia 
 
56 
block numb er seven.  I guess a comb ination of
 everything, that did it, and the boys from 
the sauna used to send in all kinds, to make 
sure that I was okay.  Remember, I wasn't a 
regular prisoner anymore. 
Q:  No, no, no.  Yeah . 

A:  I was working in the sauna, that was a quite a -- 

Q:  A privilege. 
A:  Quite a privilege. 
Q:  Yes. 

A:  Sure.  And I didn't live by the rations.  We could -- 
Q:  No. 
A:  We could organize.  We 
could steal anything we could -- 
Q:  Yeah.  Yeah. 

A:  -- from the clothing that came.  
You have no idea what people brought. 
Q:  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

A:  Okay.  So after I got a little b etter, I come out
 and go back to the -- to my sauna job.  I 
don't think I stayed there for three months.  
I think I stayed for on
ly about six weeks or 
seven weeks.  I had to go out to wo rk and 
th at wasn't fun, you know, being in  the  
strafkommando.  They  gave me a mo ck hangin
g wh en I walked in, put me on kleea (ph), 

you know what I mean -- 
Q:  On a noose? 
A:  -- on a hole regular, and then  did the trap do
or.  I fell straight through.  That was the 
initiation into the -- but the ka
po from the sauna must have
 said something to the

blockalteste from the strafkommando, take care of
 this kid, I mean I don't want him to die 
here because I was his boy. 
Q:  Yes, yes. 
A:  So the wind up, I come 
back to the sauna and I only 
-- it only got better as I went 
along.  One of these days, one
 of those days, Tippy co mes 
on an excursion to  the sauna, 
you know, to check on 
the system there, what
ever, with her SS peop
le, and she sees me 
on th e side, and I was in very  good shape, an
d we start exchanging glances and we start 
saying a few wo rds, and a romance develops.  
Okay.  I didn't  know how old she was.   
Look, to me, it's a wo
man.  She was a girl. 
Q:  Yeah. 
A:  So she came quite -- I think we must
 have -- that was '43, throughout '44. 
Q:  Yeah.  You met regularly? 

A:  Yeah.  Whenever she coul
d get away or come to the ne
w sauna.  We moved, by the 
way.  That old sauna was moved to a new lo
cation between crematorium four and five.   
They built a new sauna. 

Q:  Right. 
A:  Must have made a whole big 
deal.  It's th ere, still there. 
Q:  Right. 
A:  So. 
Q:  Yeah. 
A:  But we met, yes. 

Q:  Something about singing saving you
r life in that strafkommando?  No? 

Interview with David Wisnia 
 
58 
A:  Where?  I did in strafkommando too. 
Q:  You sang th ere? 
A:  Yeah. 
Q:  That -- that helped? 

A:  Of course.  Of course. 

Q:  And who did you sing fo r? 
A:  The blockalteste, the same.  R emember
 the man in charge of the cell block. 
Q:  The kapo or the blockalteste? 
A:  No, no.  The blockalte
ste.  He was the --   
Q:  Life or death? 

A:  Life or death. 

Q:  Yep, yep.  And so th is strafkommando liked mu sic well? 

A:  Strafkommando, of course. 
Q:  And he -- and he -- and he
 wo uld request mu sic as well? 
A:  Sure, would request -- 
Q:  Was he -- was he a Pole? 
A:  He was a Pole -- no, no, he was a German . 
Q:  He was an German.  A politico? 

A:  He was -- no.  
Q:  He was a green? 
A:  He was a green.  

Q:  He was a green badge? 

Interview with David Wisnia 
 
59 
A:  Right. 
Q:  Right. 
A:  He had a black uniform. 
Q:  Yeah.  Yeah.  So he was a criminal? 

A:  Sure.  He was a criminal. 

Q:  What was he like? 
A:  To me, there weren't -- 
Q:  He wasn't so bad? 

A:  No, no. 
Q:  Yeah, well, I mean he -- like he -- he -- 
A:  I'm sure he mu st have beat everybody. 

Q:  Yeah, sure. 

A:  It was -- this wasn 't a -- 
Q:  It's not a holiday.  
It's not a holiday camp. 
A:  Abso lutely
.  Absolutely. 
Q:  Okay.  What did you -- so 
back to the sauna, and then -- 
A:  Fast forward to 1944. 
Q:  Yeah.  So fast 
forward to 1944.   
A:  Okay . 
Q:  You're having -- you're me
eting Tippy regularly.  You're
 working back in  the sauna? 
A:  That's  right. 
Q:  Yeah. 

Interview with David Wisnia 
 
60 
A:  Working in -- we
 moved over from -- 
Q:  You moved to the new one. 
A:  -- the regular camp to the new sauna. 
 I have my own office in the sauna. 
Q:  Wow. 
A:  I have quite -- I was an old prisoner -- 

Q:  Yeah, sure. 
A:  -- who knew everybody. 
Q:  Yeah. 

A:  Even the Germans.  You follow me?   
Q:  Yeah. 
A:  Even the SS men,   when 
they looked at my 
number, I'm here.  Th
ey said he must 
know someb
ody.  Okay. 
Q:  Yeah, that's how
 the system worked? 
A:  There was a kapo, the kapo of the 
Bekleidungskammer, Klauser, who was an  
Austrian, never knew he was Jewish.  As a ma
tter of fact, my frien d Shia Kaulfus (ph) 
went to his funeral in Austria.  He was Cat
holic but he had a Jewish ancestry so he was a 
taken in there.   

Q:  Yep. 

A:  Sure. 
Q:  Yeah. 
A:  I used to sing for him. 

Q:  German songs? 

Interview with David Wisnia 
 
61 
A:  I was -- German songs.  
Q:  For him.  He liked German songs? (?indecipherable?)   
A:  He liked German -- 
Q:  Sort of the like 
the popular stuff or -- 
A:  I'm trying to remember. 

Q:  That's  okay. 
A:  It's little difficult. 
Q:  No. 

A:  But you know, it was mostly popular stuff. 
Q:  Sure, sure. 
A:  So. 

Q:  Sure. 

A:  But it is singing that saved, there's no ques
tion about it.  It was -- it singled me out as 
different from anybody else, and I was.  Conse
quently, of course, I got more food.  I got 
different food.  I got access to everything I wanted. 

Q:  Yep. 
A:  As a matter of fact, when I used to meet
 Tippy in  one of the blocks that was lined up 
with clothing and th ere was a special place, a 
hiding place about a story high where there 
was clothing.  We used to get 
in there through the side so. 
Q:  Tell me, when the crematorium, was it four or five -- 
A:  Yeah. 

Q:  I can't rememb er which one was blown up. 

Interview with David Wisnia 
 
62 
A:   Four. 
Q:  Four.  That's  when, I'm guessing was -- 
A:  That was '44. 
Q:  That was the end of '44? 

A:  Yeah. 

Q:  And transports had already stopped by -- 
A:  Hold it, no.  Transports 
stopped in Novemb er of '44. 
Q:  November, so yeah. 
A:  Well, let me tell you, when I -- fast forwar
d to '44.  We'r e beginning to  hear artillery, 
you know, at night.  We learne
d to distinguish, ba-boom, ba
-boom.  We knew it wasn't  
German.   

Q:  Yeah. 

A:  It would have had to be -- we were
 closer to the Russian side of course. 
Q:  Sure. 
A:  You know where Auschwitz is? 

Q:  Yes, yes. 
A:  Krakow. 
Q:  Yeah, yeah. 

A:  Czechoslovakia. 
Q:  Yeah. 
A:  Near the Ukraine. 

Q:  Yeah. 

Interview with David Wisnia 
 
63 
A:  Going in  that direction.  We'r e beginn
ing to hear, and we figured survive another 
week, another month.  You know, that was th
e whole point, try to survive.  Eventually, 
we knew, and George told us they're goi
ng to lose the war.  He knew it.   
Q:  Uh-h uh. 
A:  He knew it.  As a matter of fact, he used
 to tell us, the Russian front is -- it's about 50 
or 60 miles away, and they were scared to de
ath of the Ru ssians.  Well, because of what 
they did to the Russians, you can imagine. 

Q:  Yeah, yeah, 
yeah, absolutely. 
A:  It's no surprise.  So that was the greatest
 fear among the SS is that they were going to  
be sent to the Ru ssian front. 

Q:  Yes. 

A:  Because they knew that ha
d they done that, anything out of
 the __, that was the end.   
So are you all right? 
Q:  Yeah.  I'm just checking. 
A:  So at one of the liaisons with Tippy, 
she -- we agreed and we made up our mind if 
we're going to survive, at the end of the 
war, let us meet in front of the Jewish  
Community Center in Warsaw, (?undecipher
able?) and I figured -- I don't know why I 
figured it was going to be there.  I figured
 let's meet over there.  Okay.  I go on the 
transport, on the death march. 
Q:  To Gleiwitz? 
A:  To Gleiwitz, on --  

Q:  This is what --  

Interview with David Wisnia 
 
64 
A:  On one of -- this is
 in December of 1944. 
Q:  1944.   Yep. 
A:  They  stopped gassing -- I rememb er the 
uprising, because the 
sauna was right next 
door to the crematorium.  I reme mb er th
e boys running around and the machine guns 
were set up, and they  locked  
up our areas so that
 they shouldn't come into our -- we knew 
what was going on.  

Q:  Uh-h uh. 
A:  So th e windup was that after they fi
nished  that, they actua
lly stopped the gassings. 
Q:  Yes. 
A:  What do you call it, this was after 
the larg e transports, after the Hungarian -- 
Q:  After the (?indeciperhable?) transports. 
A:  The whole -- I remember (?indeciperhabl
e?) bit when they to
ok them -- they were 
supposed to go to the train 
statio n but they went to crem
atorium five.  Oh, it was -- I 
knew the whole story of what was going 
because I was privy.  I wasn't a  
(?indeciperhable?) you know. 

Q:  Yeah, yeah, yes, yes. 
A:  So I knew what was going on. 
Q:  Yep. 

A:  The windup was that we 
-- on the march, the march was not good.  I escaped from the 
march.  That was my first attempt to escape, 
but they  rounded us up and again they didn't 
shoot us, because we are strafed, you know
, and then  when we
 tried to walk -- 
Q:  By Russian bombers? 

Interview with David Wisnia 
 
65 
A:  By the Russian plan es, and wait, you're
 talking about something playing a trick on 
me, the Russian planes we saw st ars, red sta r
s, right?  Who cared, red stars, green stars, 
as long as it wasn't the swastika, right?  They
 attached themselves, 
and believe me, there 
was something for us to see, some  of the 
Germans, wounded, no arms, no legs.  They 
used to attach themselves with trucks, 
tanks, follow the column.  Remember, y ou're 
talking ab out thousands of people marching.  No
t too far, that wasn 't  near Gleiwitz.  That 
was in a different place.  Yeah, we stay over in 
Gleiwitz in the train de
pot.  Then
 they put 
us on a train -- open train to Dachau.  
Q:  Yes.  
A:  Okay . 
Q:  Yep. 

A:  Okay.  From the open train, I escaped w
ith about 12 other guys. 
 We made our way, I 
don't even know where, but we saw there was 
chaos.  There was a, what do you call it, a 
strafing or bombing.  We didn't know wh
o, by whom.  Anyway, an SS men starts 

searching and he winds -- winds us
 -- rounds us all up, brings 
us back to the train and we 
get back on the train.  Why he
 didn't kill us, I don't know.  
Okay.  We go to Dachau.  We 
arrive in Dachau.  No point 
in going in to details.  Open cars, freezing.  God almighty.  
January.  February, probably.  You can imag
ine in Germany.  Okay.  We wind up -- I 
come into Dachau.  If you ever
 saw when I came into Ausc
hwitz, no comparison.  This 
was ten times worse.   

Q:  Yes. 

A:  Why?  No place to sit.  No place to sta
nd.  No place to sleep.  No place to eat.   

Interview with David Wisnia 
 
66 
Typhoid ramp ant.  From all over, you know -- 
Q:  Yeah. 
A:  -- they got the people. 
Q:  Yeah. 

A:  And I knew already then
, if you could only again surv
ive a little bit, you know, you 
might make it. 
Q:  Yeah. 
A:  I talked to myself. 

Q:  Yeah, yeah. 
A:  So the windup, I hang around the schrei
bestube of, what do 
you call it, Dachau, 
around th ere, the closest barracks on th e side.  
I don't know how long we were in Dachau .   
But in Dachau itself, I saw -- 
this was worse than
 Auschwitz, for me it was worse.  I 
couldn't.  One day I see a sign up there, mu st
 have been ab out a couple of days or 
something like.  Anybody who can carry a -- is
 it 50 or 75-pound -- 
not pound, kilo of 
something, of cement, report.  
We need to work -- 
they were Œ they wa
n t ed  to  w o rk  on  
the underground hangars for 
the airplanes. It is now 
-- must be February. Okay. 
Everybody's strong enough.  I'm strong enough. 
 I want to get out of here, because I'm not 
going to  be able to survive here.  I don't 
know anybody.  No long
er privileged prisoner. 
You can imagine. 

Q:  Yeah. 
A:  Okay . 

Q:  I mean you're in better condition th an most. 

Interview with David Wisnia 
 
67 
A:  Yes. 
Q:  Having already been  -- 
A:  Well, many.  There were Œ there were some.  This was a group from all over the 
place, remember. 

Q:  Exactly.  So there might have been -- 

A:  So they get together, I think -- I don't 
rememb er exactly how many, and we're put on 
a train and they're going to take us to 
Muhldorf.  Do you know where Muhldorf is? 
Q:  Muhldorf was -- 

A:  Going a little fu
rther south, but -- 
Q:  Yeah, into Austria. 

A:  Into Austria. 

Q:  On th e way to Mauthausen. 

A:  I don't know.  I was -- 
Q:  I think so. 
A:  -- never in Mauthausen.   

Q:  Yeah. 
A:  So anyway Œ a
nyway, that's what 
they told us.   
Q:  Yeah. 
A:  Wisnia had enough of that crap.  So I fi
gured I am strong enough, and if I can hear Œ 
and there are -- as we get on the train, abou
t two or three times, I don't rememb er exactly, 
we have air raids. 

Q:  Uh-h uh. 

Interview with David Wisnia 
 
68 
A:  You know, strafing of the train. 
Q:  Yes. 
A:  Now, who looks at planes, what strafing, 
right.  We knew they ge
t us out of the train 
into the ditches, also
 supported with clothes, but every day as I looked, the guards 
became older. 
Q:  Yeah. 
A:  You know, I had a pretty good eye for that point. 
Q:  Yeah. 

A:  You know, to see what's going on.  Ho
w do you survive another day?  So  one of 
these, we made an attempt, a whole group, to
 run away, but they  rounded us up.  On th e 
next time, I figured I ain't going with a gro
up, I'm going by my self.  Okay .  No point in 
going in to th e details.  I had a shovel over ther
e on the side.  It was one of the guys that 
was guard ing us.  I smacked him right in th e he
ad.  As he was trying to gath er us, there 
was nobody else and I took off. 

Q:  Uh-h uh. 

A: Where do I go?  It's just
 beginning, so it's now th e beginning, I say, of March -- I 
would say th e end of February, 
beginning of March, one day 
it's nice, one day it's -- 
Q:  Horrible. 

A:  Horrible. 
Q:  Yep. 

Interview with David Wisnia 
 
69 
A:  So I'm going towards the fi
re.  I figured the only way -- no co mp ass.  Don't know my  
way.  I know I'm in Germany.  I'm outsi
de of Munich, Dachau
, but away from there 
because we -- we'r e closer to Muhldorf.  Now,
 from what I understand, we didn't go to  
Muhldrof.  We went up north 
to Merching.  I found that out
 from the historian of the  
101st.  
Q:  Right. 
A:  I wanted to find out where did I the 
meet you guys?  Where was this?  Anyway, I 
walk only at night, hide in the day.  It mu
st have been about two or three days in  the 
barns, food, plentiful.  Whatever the chickens at
e, I had more food than
 I wanted.  Okay.   
I get up one mo rning to  find a place to hide 
and th e whole war stopped.  I didn't  realize 
how important I was.  There was no fire.  Iwalked towards the artillery fire.  There was 
no fire.  I figured well, the war is over.  Well, 
let me pull up.  I get up on a little hill.  I 
look down.  There's the mo st gorgeous highway,
 but I'm trying to  find a place for the, you 
know, for the day to hide -- 

Q:  Yeah, yeah. 

A:  -- because I wouldn't walk anywhere.  I look
 down and I begi
n to hear a roar of tanks.   
If I ever prayed in my life, I 
sure prayed that time and said 
oh, God, don't let there be a 
swastika or don't let th ere be a black cro
ss that they used to
 have on the tank. 
Q:  Uh-h uh. 
A:  The column comes closer and closer and 
closer, and I see the first tank.  There's a 
column of about 15
, 16 tanks with trucks with a lineup,
 really, and I see the white star.   
Okay. 

Interview with David Wisnia 
 
70 
Q:  Yep. 
A:  Now, to me, I thought
 it was Russian, because --  
Q:  It's a star 

A:  -- I was used to seeing the star. 

Q:  Yeah, the red star, yeah, white star. 

A:  Never dreaming that it could be American , really, couldn't  have -- somehow it went 
comp letely out of my  mind.   
Q:  Yeah. 

A:  So I start to run down fro
m that incline.  I have a note here from Sergeant -- Staff  
Sergeant Ballou.  He says, "I still remember 
you coming down the h
ill."  I start running 

down.  The only thing that gave a me away, 
I didn't  have much hair, but I had civilian 
clothes. 

Q:  So you didn't  have stripes? 
A:  Oh, no.  I had gotten rid of that --  
Q:  Right, right. 

A:  -- a long time ago --  
Q:  Right. 
A:  -- before we went to Gleiwitz, I had already gotten rid of that.   

Q:  Right. 
A:  Sure.  I had civilian clothes.  I come do
wn and didn't have enou
gh strength to get in 
front of th e tank.  Right at the ditch alongs
ide -- I didn't know how important I was.  The 

Interview with David Wisnia 
 
71 
whole column  stopped.  The war, it  stopped fo
r Wisnia.  You think Wisnia is important, 
right?  Out of the hatch crawls out a -- first 
tank stops, crawls out a Captain James L.  
Walker from South Carolina.  I mean I kne
w word s in English be
cause I had learned 
words.  You know, you don 't lea r n sentences. 
Q:  Yeah. 

A:  You learn words, right?  He crawls
 out.  He immediately knew I escaped from 
somewhere.  I go over to him.  I says, "You, 
Russian?"  He says, "No,
 no, no.  merican." I 
said, oh-oh, they'r e trying to  trick me.  I says, 
"You, Ru ssian?"  He says, "No, American.   
Where ya come from" -- you know, with 
that southern  -- I never heard such  
English in my life.  I never h
eard English in my  life, but not 
like this.   He says, "Where 
you escape?  Train?  SS?"  Something -- I got wo
rds.  I says, "Yes, SS, train."  He knew I 
escaped from a train.  I should 
take him.  You follow?  I shou
ld lead the column where.   
Can't speak to her.  I have a brain, I'm in 
the ditch and there's th
e tank, right, and th e 
whole column  is stopped.  They  all stopped.  So
 he says -- I said to him, "Any Polish?"   
He got the message.  I'm looking fo r somebody I 
can talk to, Polish.  He said, "Yeah, we 

got one.  Fred Wiltsack (ph), Fr
ed Wiltsack."  Yells down, an d the road.  You had to see 
the tanks.  There was enough ro
om for a jeep to drive by, takes a few minutes.  A jeep 
drives up with Fred Wiltsack 
from Pawtucket, Rhode Island.  
By  the way, he came to his 
bar mitzvah.  I got him coming.  Fred Wilts
ack comes up and he goes over to me and he 
says -- starts talking Polish.  His Polish was wo
rse than my English. 
 I couldn't talk to 
him.  Couldn't talk to him.  They want me ta
ke them where the SS is.  I can 't tell them.   

Interview with David Wisnia 
 
72 
Okay.  Wait.  I'm not finished.  I had a brai
nstorm.  I figured, you see, I heard the story 
that there were Germans disguised 
as Americans, you follow me?  
Q:  Yeah. 
A:  And I figured , you know, after all, you know,
 that I saw, I figured that can't  be true. 
Q:  Yeah, yeah.  You were very suspicious. 

A:  Can't b e true.  Can't be true.  So I sa
id, "Any Yiddish ?"  You see, you don't say  
Jewish, because in Europe, it's
 not Jewish, it's Yiddish. 
Q:  It's Yiddish, yeah, sure. 

A:  Okay.  So I said to th
is captain, I says, "Anybody Yiddi
sh?"  He says, "Yeah, we got 
one."   He yells down again, "Harry Wein
er.  Harry Weiner."  Harry Weiner from  
Tarzana, California drives up on a jeep.  The 
next jeep comes up, you know, like I have 
to explain to me -- you know 
what?  He brought him up.  It alleviated a little bit of my 

suspicion.  And he started ta
lking Yiddish.  The other guy'
s Polish was bad, his Yiddish 
was worse. 

Q:  Was worse. 

A:  He came from Tarzana, California.  It wa
s a like a comedy of erro
rs.  Then they did 
something worse.  He took me 
back in the jeep.  They want
ed to continue.  The war was 
on. 

Q:  Yeah, yeah. 
A:  So he took me back.  
He wanted to put me in to 
check me out, in one of those 
weapons carriers that had the Red Cross on it.
  I don't know if you saw, the American  

Interview with David Wisnia 
 
73 
Army, they had normally following
 them.  I refused to go in
 there.  I was scared.  I 
figured, you know, I heard that that's
 where they asphyxiate the people. 
Q:  Yeah, yeah. 
A:  And I still didn't believe it.  I n ever left 
them until I came to the States.  That was a 

slow process -- 

Q:  Of building up trust? 
A:  -- with them, building -- not only building 
up trust.  What they did is I became the 
eater of all their Spam.  I loved their Spam 
rations, their chocolate.  They all threw it 
away; they gave it to me
.  Then I got sick eating.  They 
put me in uniform.  They taught 
me how to use the Thomson, and let me tell 
you, that became my  family, and really, did 
they become my family.  I'll show you, 
__+ you know and by 
the way this is my 
grandson's --  

Q:  All right.  
A:  -- piece of music that he wrote.  All ri
ght.  Here's a p icture of the ___ Synagogue. 
Q:  This is you? 
A:  That's  me.  That's 
my little baby machine gun. 
Q:  And who is standing next to you? 
A:  That's  another -- I've been searching for hi
m.  He doesn 't come.  He doesn't show up.   
That's  me and th at's me too.  That's  in Zell 
Am See before we went to -- what do you call 
it? Burcheskan (ph). 

Q:  Right. 

A:  You know who that is, don't you? 

Interview with David Wisnia 
 
74 
Q:  Who is that? 
A:  Who is the good looking fella? 
Q:  That's  you? 
A:  Right.  That's  my wife. 

Q:  Yeah, who is the -- 

A:  Menachem Begin. 
Q:  Oh.  I thought so.  I shoul
d have recognized the glasses. 
A:  Yeah, yeah.  You want to s
ee a good lo oking kid, that's me. 
Q:  Is that the origin al photo? 
A:  Yeah. 
Q:  Wow. 

A:  March '45. 

Q:  Yeah, amazing. 
A:  And here this is my frie
nd, Fred Ballou.  By the way, 
this is the group that came to
