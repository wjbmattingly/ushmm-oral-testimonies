isa series of  weekly conversations with survi vors of  the Holocaust who sharewith 
us their f irsthand accountsof  their experience during thisera. Each guest serves as a volunteer here 
a t  t he  m u s eum
.  Our program  is going to continue,as itdoes every year, until about the middle of 
August. Them useum 's website, at www.ushm m.org, provides inf orm ation about each of  the

gu e st s.   
 
 
Gerry is goin g to share with us his 
F i rs t  P e rs on
 
account asa Holocaust survivor f or about40 
m inutes, if time allows towards theend of theprogram  we'll have anopportunityf or you to ask him a 
few questions.  
 
 
T he lif e stories of the Holocaust survi vors transcend the decades. W hat you areabouttoh
ear 
f rom  Gerry is just one individual's accountof  the Holocaust. W hat I'd like to dof or you asan 
introduction is to show you a brief  slide presentation to give you theoutlines of Gerry's car eer and lif e.  
 
 
Gerry was born in a sm all town outside of  Freiburg, Germany, andhisfather, David Schwab,

owned an international plumbing supplies business. T here's the location. T he arrow points a littlebit 
further to the center of Germ any than it should.  Heactually gre w up in a town ver y close to the Rhine 
River and the Frenchborder.  
 
 
In thisphotograph is a picture of the school that Gerry attended,and this was a public school, 
andGerry was the only Jewish child in that school. This photograph was taken in 1932, one year 
bef ore the Nazis cam e to power, andGerry is  sitting in the m iddle row at thefar right, next to the 
teacher.  
 
 
T hisnext slide shows Gerry's f am ily, somewhat later, after the Nazi s came to power.  Gerry's 
parents arehere, andhis sister Margot, whohadthe goodfortune to get to the
 
United States already 
in the 1930s.  
 
 
T his isa very im portant document, to which Gerry is determ ined to return,and he'll have my 
head if  we don't returnto it. This docum ent was issued to Gerry's father, andas you can see on the 

lower ri ght, though you m ay not be able to read the signature, it's signedby Adolph Hitler him self . 
Gerry's f ather was a war veteran,and as lateas 1935, the datehere is May 3, 1935, Hitlerpersonally 
signed certif icates honoring, gi ving the Cross of  Honor toW orldW arI v
eterans in Germany, 
regardless of  whether they were Jewish.  I'll let Gerry explain its significance later on.  
 
 
On the nightof  November 9
-
10, 1938, justif ying their actions with the death of a Germ an 
consularoff icial, who had been assassinateda couple
 
of days earlier, the Nazi leadershipordered out 
the rank andf ile of theparty, theSS andtheStorm T roopers, to make an open season against the 
Jewish population. Som e91persons were killed; at least, that's what the records say.  267 
synagogues were
 
burned down, and over 15,000 Jewish homes and businesses were destroyed

within the space of about 36 hours.  
 
 
Gerald'sfather was one ofupto30,000 Jews arrested in theday af ter the violence, and sent to 
oneof  Germany's three concentration camps at the tim e.  He went to Dachau, outside ofMunich.  
 
 
He was released shortly after, on the expectation thathe would leave Germany as soon as 
possible.  Gerry's dad and his mom, seeing that Germany was no longer a place where Gerry could 
be safe, were prescient enough to send him  to Switzerland.  He was one of a groupof 280children 
sent to Switzerland in late 1938,early 1939, and Gerry wil l tell you in more detail about that 
experience.  He also cam e back toGermany brief ly topick up his visa and emigrate
 
to the United 
States in 1940.  
 
 
Bef ore hef inished high school, there's aphotograph of Jews arrested in southern Germ any, 
bef ore deportationto Dachau.  Gerry traveled with a pass.  Hisnam e was Gerd.  Gerald is an 

anglici zation of the Germ an name Gerd.
  
Hetraveled with a pass, and he sportedone of the new 
passes, passports,that were demandedby the Swiss authorities. The initiative cam ef rom 

Swit zerland. T hey wanted to know who com ing f rom  Germany or Austria, which was incorporated by 
Germ any in March of 1938, was Jewish.  T heGerm ans were only too will ing to accommodate,and 
this is the meaning of  this big red J on thepassport, which standsfor Juda,the Germ an wordf or Jew.  
 
 
Now, Gerr y cam e to the United Statesand, bef orehe couldf inishhigh school, volunteered to 
serve in the US Armed Forces, and wentover and saw com bat,pretty severe com bat in Italy.  
 
 
Af ter the war, af ter leaving m ilitar y ser vice, he was assigned asa civil ian to the Nuremberg war 
crim es detachment, and there participated
 
inseveral of the interrogations of top Germ an generals.

cam era, and with his back tothe cam era isthe inf am ous Germ an general Gerd von
 
Runstedt, who 
had led thef inal German offensive in the west in the Arden Forest,which led to theBattleof  the 
Bulge in late 1944.  
 
 
W ith that, I would liketo introduceto you Gerry Schwab, andalso note that his wif e Joan 
Schwab, who is alsoasurvivor of  the Holocaust, cam eover to England ina Kindertransport, or 
transport of  children, in 1939, isalso here towatch theprogram .  
 
 
T hank you very m uch. Gerry?  
 
[Applause]
 
T o behonest with you, not even 2%of  the whole story.  2%.  
 
 
Gerry, tell us a little bitabout your childhood. How big was the town you gre w up in? W hat 
were your relations with
 
--
 
you were the only Jewish kid in town. W hat were your relations with other 
folks in town, kids and adults, and tell us a little bitabout your parents, your father's profession, and 
their connections withGerm any as their chosen country.  
 
>> Gerald Schwab:W ell, I was born likeeverybody else, and went to school in Germ any, in a town 

called Freiburg, which is notall that sm all, about 100,000.  It'sonthe edge of the Bl
a ck Fo rest .   I  
guess we were sort of a m iddle class.  My f ather had a business, which was based partially in 

Germ any, partially in Switzerland, and alsoabranch in France. T his sounds a lotm ore im pressive, 
but considerthat these three countries were all about am ileapart.  It's on theedge near where the 
Rhine River m akesthat bend. If  you'reacross the river, you're in France.  If  you gothe other 
direction, you go into Switzerland.  
 
 
T he Nazis cam e to power in 1933.T hat's when life changed.

>> 
Peter Black: How old were you then?  
 
>> Gerald Schwab: In1933 I was the ripeold age of 8 years. W e went to Switzerland. T he business, 
the warehouse that we had was in the city ofBasel. Anybody hasbeen in Switzerland m ight have 
been there.  The Swis
s  were willin g, we were able to get there, but they weren't willing to give you 
residency, so we m oved a m ile across into France.  Ihad the pleasure then to switch, at age 8or 9,to 

a French school.  
 
 
W estayed there a couple of years, didn't seem  to work too well, and for reasons which are 
really due 
--
 
how should I say? T oo difficult to explain. Let me put it this way:  My fatherused to, 
later on, say "W e gettoo soonold andtoo late smart." W em oved back toGermany.  And that 

docum ent that Peter 
pointed out had some effect on that.  
 
 
W ethen moved to another Germ an town, smaller town, calledLurag, separatedf rom  
Swit zerland by a streetcar. T hat gives you an ideahow far it was.  And lived there.  Now, what 
happened,of  course, is things imm ediately gotm orediff icultfor Jewish inhabitants.  
 
 
Lastnight I hadthef ortuneof digging through m y f iles. I came up with the list of anti
-Je wish  
laws in Germ any, and the f irst one which Ihave listedhere was on April 11, 1933, that'sbasically 
im me d ia
tely af ter the election, and over a period of years, there were 150, at least 150 laws designed 
to m ake life m ore diff icult f or Jewish inhabitants.  
 

 
If you wonder how they could passthat many laws, ver y sim ple, there's one guy at the topwho 
signed it, andthat was it.  Infact, by thetimewe lef t Germany in 1940, 166 laws.  T heseare some of 

them  rather sm all ones.  Germ ans were ver y good. T hey had laws, andthey amended them ,and 
am ended them ,and am ended them.  Someof  them were serious. I mean,f or instance, who could be 

 
ROUGH DRAFT  T RANSCRIPT

a veterinarian. Others, on theother hand, were a lotmore serious unless you were, of  course, if you 
were a veterinarian that one was ver y serious.  
 
>> Peter Black: Can you say, Gerry, can you tell the audience about how some of
 
this legislation 
aff ected youaf ter you returned to Germ any, but bef ore you lef tfor Switzerland?  
 
>> Gerald Schwab:W ell, it affectedm y parents more than, obviously, m e.  I wenttoa Germ an 
school. The laws were increasingly diff icultfor Jewish inhab
ita nts.  
 
 
In 1935 you had thefam ous Nurem berg Laws, which m ade it illegal to have any close 
relationship between Germ an Aryans and Jews.  
 
 
At age 10, that really didn't affect me terribly m uch.  Butover tim e things becam e increasingly 
d if f icu lt .   
 
 
T he
n came the Olym pics, 1936, when thingseased off, although som eof  these signs " Jews 
aren't wished here" orpark benches that said " Onlyf or Jews"  or " Jews are prohibitedf rom using"  
were rem oved. T hey cam e back af ter the Olym pics were over.  Andm y f athe
r's business became 
increasingly lim ited, certainly the Germ an part of  it,but he was still able to drive to Switzerl andand 
sell his products. 
 
 
In 1938 there cam ean event which Peter ref erred to,the assassination of a Germanthird 
secretary of  the
 
--
 
theGerm an em bassy in Paris, by a Jewish kid whoseparents had lived in 
Germ any since, Ibelieve, 1911. T hey cam efrom  Poland initially and escaped to Germany at that 

tim e,because thef ather wasn't anxious tobe draf ted into thearm y.  
 
 
His parents, in 1938, were sent to
 
--
 
well, they were pushed acrossthe border into Poland, 

 
ROUGH DRAFT  T RANSCRIPT

saying " You're not Germ ans."  Infact, nobody who cam e into Germ any af ter early 1900s was 
considered a Germ an. So they were either statelessor retainedtheir Polish citizenship. 
  
T hey were pushedacross the border. They wrote apostcard to their son, who was living 
illegall y with an uncle in Paris,and went intothe Germ an em bassy, saw the third secretary, the low 
m an on the totem  pole, and killed him .  He did nottry to escape.
  
Hewas French.  And in Germ any 
this was theexcuse that they really needed.  
 
 
T hey f orced
 
--
 
well, they basically, how should I say? T hey made the m ost of it.  Jewish 
property was conf iscated.  Fam ilieshad topay
 
--
 
Je ws in Germ any, large fines. The 
fa ct tha t 
hundredsand hundreds of stores, Jewish
-
owned stores,the windows had beendestroyed. They had 
to have repairedat their own expense.  Of course, in themeantim e,they'd alsobeen kicked out of the 

Germ an insurancef irms.  It was really bad. 
 
>
> Peter Black:Gerry, do you rem em ber thenight your dad was arrested?  
 
>> Gerald Schwab:W ell, that was one of the f irstthings that happened.  My parents wentf rom Lurag, 
where we li ved at that point, to Freiberg.  Obviously, som ebody recognized him  on the street, andhe 
was arrested there and sent off to Dachau concentration camp.  
 
 
My m other, who was not a bad driver, drove the carback to our home.  Obviously, a com plete 
nervous wreck.  I can't blame her.  Youdidn'tknow where the people were sent, 
but as Peter 
m entioned,about30,000 of them, 10,000each tothree concentration camps,Buchenwald, Dachau 

and Sachsnaw.  
 
>>
 
Gerald Schwab:T hank you.  Them ost direct effect in ourf am ily was this one Jewish kid in this 
one school was told he shouldn't show up any m ore.  I was kicked out.  Now, letm e pointout that this 

 
ROUGH DRAFT  T RANSCRIPT

was not a tragicm atter, asfar as I'm  concerned.  
 
[Laughter]
 
Especially since I wasabout tof lunk Latin. My m otherdidn't see it quite that way.  My f ather was in 
concentration cam pabouteight weeks.  He cam e out. Keep inm ind, this was Novem ber,December, 
Dachau was a concentration cam p near Munich, city
 
of  Munich, andhe was in really bad shape.  
Frostbite,hehad all sorts of  serious medicalproblem s.  
 
 
My m other wrote to
 
--
 
in the meantime, afterKristallnacht, thisby the way is called Kristallnacht 
because,obviously, a lot of glass or crystal was broken. Som eof  the stores
 
--
 
they didn't lim it them , 
people didn't lim it themselves to breaking glass. T hey decidedto clean out theexhibits, too.  So she 
wrote toanorganization and asked, Can't you takem y kid?  Interestingly enough, about10years a
go  
som ebody wrote the Swiss authorities, and within three days we had a copy of  my m other's letter. 
T hat's why I rem em ber what she said.  
 
 
T he reason shedid is that shortly after the
 
--
 
shortly af ter the Crystal Night, the British 
governm ent said, W e wi
ll take 10,000 Jewish kids.  As aform er USbureaucrat,I must say it was 
am azing how fast they did it. They had som ething called the children's transports. T hey m oved kids 

out,as Peterm entioned.  This ishow m y wif e, who was born in Berlin, got out of
 
Germ any.  AndI 
was one of about280people who ended up in
 
--
 
they said right to the Swiss authorities.W ell, m y 
m other did, andI ended up beingm oved to Swit zerland.  
 
>> Peter Black:W hatdid you do there?W hat did you do once you got toSwitzerland?
  
 
>> Gerald Schwab:W ell, the big thing is Ifound out very quickl y I am  not somehow bornto be a 

f a rm e r.   
 

 
ROUGH DRAFT  T RANSCRIPT

[Laughter]
 
I ended up in thisSwiss villa ge of , Ibelieve, about 350 inhabitants, and there was afarm . T hey had 
nine cows
 
--
 
eight cows, some landaround it.  The village is in the center,then you have property in 
theoutside,andthef arm er, I must say, I appreciate it now m ore than then,they wantedtohelpm e.  

But theyf igured that I would be happiest if  Iworked.  They had lost a child abouttwo year s earlier.  I 
was expected to take their place.  
 
 
As I say, it was not a very happy m arriage.  I learned how to m ilk cows.  T his was bef ore the 
m ilking m achine,by the way.  T hat's quite an experience. I went into the barn, andthe horse kicked 
m
e across the barn on the f irst tim e I went in.  It didn't help m atters.  
 
 
Anyhow, I stayed there, and stayeduntil about October, November of 1939. Inthe meantime, 
of  course, the war had brokenout.  At thatpoint, I was transferred. Somebody hadpity onm e, and I 
ended up with afundamentalist Christianf amily, and I must say they were absolutely wonderful.  
T hey did not try to proselyti ze, they tried to help me inany wa y they could. Of  course,the vil lage, 
which is outsideof  Zurich, was also very sm all, butI stayed with them until May of  1940.  
 
 
In them eantim e,during this periodaf ter Kristallnacht, Jews were no longer perm itted to have 
autom obiles ordrivers' licenses. And asa result
 
--
 
or Jewish m alescouldn't.  My father could no 
longer conductbusiness in Switzerland.  And by that tim e, everybody reali zed it's tim e to get the 

hell
 
--
 
the heck out of  there.  
 
 
T he Germ ans were reluctant to let you goat thatpoint, if  they thought you hadforeign 
currency or property overseas, outside of Germ any.  Inf act, there was a law, there was a law that it 
was punishable if  youdid not
 
--
 
anything against Jews at thatperiod of  tim e, we're talking about som e 

 
ROUGH DRAFT  T RANSCRIPT

11
 
pretty heavy punishment, concentration cam ps, etc. 
 
 
W e were not allowed to have property orfunds outsidethe country, and in order to get the 
heck outof  Germ any you hadtohave perm ission. W ell,until the Germ ans were convinced that you 
no longer had any access to foreign currency, they wouldn't give yo u the perm ission.  
 
 
Now, peoplem ay wonder over this whole period of time why Je ws didn't just get out of 
Germ any. W ell,the young peopleat thatpoint, who had not establisheda businessor something, 
som ething equivalent,they lef t in1933. And if  you lookat the statistics, it started there,
 
and the 
numberof  Jews leaving Germ any decreasedyear af ter year af ter year, until November1938, at 

which point it shoots up. That's wheneveryb ody really got the idea.  
 
 
T he reason Jews did not leave Germ any in as large numberas onem ight wish or wonder was 
the very f actthat, A., som e peoplef igured this thing is going to pass, this is a tem porary thing, Hitler 

is going to go like so many form er governments in Germ any.  Andthen,of course, there was a big to 
do about Germ an ex
-
soldiers who had been 
--
 
not only were soldiers, but hadfoughton thef ront.  My 
father, duringW orldWar I, was wounded three times, andas we saw in this document, in1935, two 

years af ter Hitler cam e to power, he still got an award.  Obviously, many felt nothing wouldhappe
n to 
th em .  
 
 
And then there was the third group thatfelt that they just couldn't leave.  They hadf oughtfor 
the Kaiser,and som eof the older people especially f elt this was theonly country they'd known, and 
they wanted to stay this wa y.  
 
>> P e t e r  B l a
ck:Gerry, when the visas cam ethrough,for your folks andfor you, tell folks abouthow 
you went back to Germ any and then how you got out of Germ any.

>> Gerald Schwab:W ell, m y parents called. T he Germ ans hadf inally decided thatthey could leave, 
and 
we had gota visa, or had registeredfor a visa, to com e to theAm erican consulate in Stuttgart.  
Some of the ex
-
GIs here, they remem ber that town. W e went there. I was called back. I got a 
special visa to getback into Germany.  
 
 
W esat there in the waiting room of  the consulate,and Ipointedoutto m y mother, "Look."  In 
the Germannewspaper, it said silly propaganda, theGermantroops are am assing on theborders, 
and it's just propaganda, it's not true.  
 
 
W ell, thedate that we got our visa was May
 
1 0, 1940.  On May 10,German invaded Holland, 
Belgium  and France,or attacked France.  Upto then, they had something called theSitzkri egW ar, 
andthat's when the war in
 
--
 
European war really started.  
 
>> Peter Black: You physicall y got out through Ita
ly,  righ t ?   
 
>> Gerald Schwab: Yes. W e got our visa on the 10th.  Ithink we went back to our town onthe11th, 
andI think we probably lef t on the12th. W ent to Italy, cam eto theStates from  Genoa, and 
fortunately theItalians declared war on the French, and the Brits, while we were at sea.  Because, 
otherwise, that way of  getting outof  Germ any would have
 
--
 
well, at thatpoint, it becam e impossible 
to get outof  Germ any.  So anyhow, we got to the States.  
 
>> Peter Black: You were a teenager by thetim e you got to theStates, right?  
 
>> Gerald Schwab: Oh, yes.  I certainly was a teenager.  I was
 
--
 
I went to school, went to junior high, 
andend up with
 
--
 
I lost some tim e in between.  Now we're beyond the Holocaustperiod as far as 
we're concerned.  My parents,f atherhad previousl y, as I said, been a businessm an.  He opened up a 

poultry farm  in central New
 
Jersey.  Any Ne w
 
Jerseyites here?  Here?  AndI grew upf or a couple of

years in Hightstown, and at thatpoint m yf ather told thedraf t board that I was an essentialworker and 
askedfor def erm ent.  I called thedraf tboardand said," Don't you dare do thisagain."  I was af raid I 
was going to m iss this whole thing.  
 
T hen,atthat point then, I got intothe arm y, spent a gloriousperiodof time in C
amp 
Blanding, Florida.  I can use som e cynicism ,can't I?  
 
[Laughter]
 
And went to Italy, and becam eam em ber of  the 10th Mountain Division. T o answer anybody who 
wants to know whether I did any skiing there,no. W ehad ski unif orm s, but we
 
--
 
I never skied there.  
 
>> Peter Black: You saw some pretty severe com bat. 
 
>> Gerald Schwab:W e saw som e com bat, yeah. T hat onepicture, by the way, ofm e with Field 
Marshal von
 
Runstedt, therehe is, it was an interesting experience. I had been
 
--
 
a ctua lly, a t t
ha t  
pointI was a civilian wearing an Eisenhower jacket. I did wear m y com bathat. T hat's theonething 

we were proudof  inaddition to that.  It was worth $10am onth, if you had oneof  those.  
 
 
Af ter theend of the war I was transf erredtoan intellig
ence operation in Austria, and when time 
cam e to leave the army I was notan ideal soldier.  In other words, Icouldn't be a soldier nor af arm er. 
I ended up, asa civilia n, at Nurem berg.  
 
 
Now, m ay I ask one question?  How m any ofyou know of the Nurem b
erg T rials?  Quite a few.  
 
 
In thisday and age, cable TV, we have trials of  the century all the tim e, nowadays. W ell, the 
Nurem berg T rial was the trial of the century,because just about every survi ving m ajor Germ anf igure, 

exceptf or Hitler and Goebbels, who comm itted suicide, were on trialthere. Gerring, Hess. I was the 
interpreter, translator.  Somebody is bound tosay, T his kid?  20,21 years of age?  How could he?

W ell, as we say, In the land of  theblind,the one
-
eyed is king.  If you speak English and you 
speakGerman, this is it.  So I spent, well, about six m onths at thef irst trial of themajor Germ an war 
crim inals, had some interesting experiencesthere. I worked primarily with the Germ an general staff.  
 
 
Here I was a corporaldealing with f ield marshals.  One particular tim eI lookedover, I was in 
what we'd call here the greenroom , I was waiting to go on, and thenext witness was standing there, it 
was Field Marshal Kesselring, who had beenthehead of the Germ an Air Forceand alsoon 
t he  
Italianf ront.  So this corporal spoke with thatfield marshal about the Italian war.  Heaskedm e where 
I learnedm y Germ an. I f igured he hadenough problem s.  Hedidn'tneed to know where Iwould tell 
him . But in hisparticular case,I did.  He was
 
personally a nice individual. SoI told him .  
 
 
His response was, "T hey m ust be really satisfactiontobe working here." T heonly thing I 
could say " You're right, fieldm arshal."  W hatelse could you say?  
 
>> Peter Black:Gerry, bef ore we open it up to
 
questions, there's one m ore anecdotef rom this period 
that youhave to talkabout, and that was about thatSR leaderf rom your hometown.  
 
>> Gerald Schwab:W ell, actually, he was the SA leaderf or
 
--
 
the SA was a major Storm Troopers, 
wa s  a  Na zi p o lit ic a
l organization which endangered Hitler's wanting to work with thearm y, and in 
1934 you had thefam ous massacreof  the leadershipof  theSA. And af ter that,the SAnever again 

was anything of  consequence. 
 
 
T hey never hada position that thehead was chi
ef  of  s t af f .  W el l , t he c h i ef of  s taf f h a d t he  
m isf ortuneof having an autom obile accident in 1943.  I thinkhis carwas shot up by f ighterplanes, 
and so thedeputy, hewas at the Nuremberg T rials asa witness.  He wasn't tried there.  
 
 
He wanted to know

to collect inf orm ation for themain trial,and you hadone interpreterdoing both Germ an and English.  
T hem aintrial, of  course, was held inf our different languages: Germ an, Fr
ench, Russian and 
English.  But in this particular section it was only Germ anand English, and instead of having a whole 

bankof  interpreters, they had oneperson who didboth, Germ an

Germ an.  W hich, 
by the way, resulted ina num ber of problem s. W henGermanf ieldm arshals started talking about 

som e of theirexperience and so on, I

whatdid I know?  I didn't know the Germ an.  Ididn't know the 
E n glish .  B ut I go tth rou gh .  
 
 
T hisparticular individual, headof  theSA, which had been instrum ental in destroying Jewis h 
synagogues, stores,during Cr ystal Night, wa s trying to convince the hearing, orthe people in charge 

of  the hearing, thatall they did was try to protect property.  Didn't spell out which property, but it was 
b a s ic a lly a ll p r
operty. Andhe wanted to know where I learnedm y Germ an. I decided, No way.  And I 
refused.  
 
 
Finally, the guy got on m y nerves, af terhehad beentalking aboutthe work ofthe SAduring 
Cr ystal Night, andI told him.  I learnedm y Germ an in Germ any and
 
I was thereduring Crystal Night.  
And,asm y wif e used that English saying, the penny f inally dropped.  Hef inally f igured it out, and I 
was no longer bothered by him . 
 
>> Peter Black:Gerry, I'd like to throw this open to questions, with the mention thataf ter the war you 

worked f orthe US State Departm ent, had a whole career with them . I wanted them  to know that.  I 
would like to open the floorf or questions thatyou m ight have of Gerry.  
 
 
I thinkthere arefolks with m icrophones on either side, sothose of you who have questions, 
wait f or them icrophones so that everybody c an hear the question. T hank you.

>> T hank you, Gerry.  You're delightf ul. I have a questionabout your father. W hy was hetakento 
concentration cam p, and why was he released?
  
W asthat unusual to be releasedonce som eone was 
im prisoned ina concentration cam p?  
 
>> Peter Black:Gerry, didn'tpick up the question.  I'm  going to repeat it. W hy was yourf ather sentto 
a concentration camp?  More importantly, wh y was he released 
shortly af ter?  
 
>> Gerald Schwab: He was sent to a concentration cam p because he was Jewish.  Sim ple.  Very 
sim ple.T hey got everybody they could get their handson,m en between the ages of 16, 17 up to 
about 60.  
 
 
He was released, most of these people were released within about8to 10 weeks.  Places like 
Dachau were notexterm ination camps.  Dachau was a concentration cam p that the initial inhabitants 
were workers, leaders, comm unists,etc.,butby 1938they were Jews had entry as well.  
 
 
T he f act tha
the was af ront camp, thathe was af rontline soldier, got him out somewhat 
earlier.  But I would say
 
--
 
a num ber of people, obviously, died, some of them by suicide, running into 
theelectricf ences,but at thatpoint it was not anexterm ination camp, it
 
was a placefor, as the 
Germ ans called it,preventive
 
--
  
>> Peter Black:Protective custody.  
 
>> Gerald Schwab: Protective custody.  Don't askm e who they protected.  
 
>> Peter Black:Thebasic purposef orthe release, thepurposefor the round
-
up was to provide som e 
" incentive" f or Jews toleave the country, leavi ng their assets behind, and people were released on 
theprom ise that they would get outas soonas possible, andthat they would identif y their assets, so 
thatthe Germ ans could seize them .

Any m ore questions? Yes, sir?  
 
>> T hanksf or sucha rich story, history.  I was wondering if  you could commenton thedocum ent that 
you're showing up on the screen bef ore, andthe im plications andmotivations behind it, hash out this 
docum ent.  The award
 
to yourf atherfor his serving.  
 
>> Peter Black: He's interested inhearing you talkf urther about thedocument that we putup,and 

what its signif icance was for yourf ather'sdecisionm aking process in the 1930sabout getting out of 
Ge rm an y.  
 
>> Gerald Schwab:W ell, it was actually theaward cam enotf rom  personally f rom  Hitler,althoughhe 
signed off on it, but the president, who at thatpoint was Hindenberg, who was a Germ anf ield 
m arshal duringW orldWar I, who was a rather revered individual.  Itwas
 
a wa y of  showing the 
country's appreciationfor people whohadf ought for the war for Germ any.  I would say it was a
 
--
 
well, a PR routine.  
 
>> Peter Black:W hat influence 
--
 
I think thiswas the coreof  the question: W hat inf luence did getting 
that certif icate have on your f ather'sdecisionm aking?  
 
>> Gerald Schwab: I think that particular docum ent eventually resulted inthe murder of a lot of 

people. People who wouldotherwise have left earlier stayed longer. This thing is going topass; it's 
not going to beall thatdangerous; we canafford to wait.  In oneof  the publications of theHolocaust 
Museum  they have a copy of that. Itnaturally caused people, certainly, tof eelthat there was a 
special privilege in having beenaf rontline soldier during
 
the war of  1914.  
 
>> Peter Black:Any other questions?  Yes, sir?  
 
>>W ith the movie "T he Nuremberg T rial"  was that quite accurate, or did they leave things out?

>> Gerald Schwab:W ell, it was af ictionalized one,but yeah.  It was an interesting, very i nteresting 
experience. Becauseyou saw a great deal
 
--
 
f irstof all, you saw a great deal of the Germ an 
leadership, the toppeople, andI would say it's af ictionalized story.  
 

>> Peter Black: For the audience, thef ilm  that the guest ref erred to was the 1962f ilm " Justice at 
Nurem berg."  T he trial of the top justicem inistry off icials didhappen.  The nam es were historical 
names. Of  course,Burt Lancaster was not one of the Nurem berg prosecutors. This was Hollywood, 
and it was spedupforthe Hollywood purposes, but the generalhistory is pretty accurate.  
 
>> Gerald Schwab: Since you referred to the Justice Departm ent, Iwas
 
--
 
af ter the Nuremberg, the 
f irst trial, subsequently there were about 9,10
 
--
  
>> Peter Black:12?  
 
>> Gerald Schwab: 12
 
other trials, and oneof them  that was scheduled was the justice trial, and the 
m aindefendant of thatwas to bea manby the nam e of T irac, and Itransf erredf or6, 8 months to 

Berlin where all of the docum ents were located to prepared documentation for the subsequent trial.  
 
 
W e worked very hard at it,except that wef oundout two m onthsaf ter thefact that Mr.
 
T i ra c  
had comm itted suicide.  It was a com plete waste.  
 
>> Peter Black:T im efor one more question. I think this youngm an down here had hishand up.  
 
>> So your exact job when you were an interpreter, were you
 
--
 
was i t written Germ an or spoken 
Germ an? And during the trial were you interpreting the lawyers to the court, or what was your exact 

job?  
 
>> Peter Black:The question was, when you were an interpreter, were you actually interpreting 

during thetrial, or where were you interpreting?

>> Gerald Schwab:T he trial took place inthe large courtroom . Inaddition, which is m ainly forgotten, 
in addition to the22,23 defendants, there were
 
also sevenorganizations which were on trial.  Now, 
seven organizations, all with a large number of members. Everybody wanted to be heard.T he idea 

was that if  you were am em ber of  theSSor a m em ber of the Reich's cabinet, two of the 
organizations, that being convicted or if  there were f ound tobe crim inal organizations,they should
 
--
 
that wouldm ake lif ea lot easierf or theauthorities, the postwar authorities.  And since there was so 

m uch inf orm ation com ing in, it was decided to have a separatehearing, or separate hearing f or these 
organizations.  For these organizations, they either subm itted aff idavits by the thousands,or had 
wit n e sse s.   
 
 
For instance, general's staff  was oneof  theorganizations, and justabout every m em ber of the 
Germ an general staffwas a witness, eitherfor or againstthe organization being declaredguilty of  one 
of  thefour indictm ents.  
 
>> Peter Black: You interpretedf or those
 
--
  
>> Gerald Schwab: And I interpretedfor those organizations,for those hearings. W e hadfou
r 

comm issioners, usually one sitting. T he chief  comm issioner was am an by thenam eof

what was 
his nam e?  It was a Brit, British colonel, 31 years of  age.  
 
>> Peter Black: Harry Nee.  
 
>> Gerald Schwab: Harr y Nee, who subsequently went back to England
, became f irst secretary or 
whatever it is on the
 
--
 
for the northern island.  One day leaving parliam ent,his carblew up. That was 
theend of  Harry Nee.  Wonderf ul guy.
