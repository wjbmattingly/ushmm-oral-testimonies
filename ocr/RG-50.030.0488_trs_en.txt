Q: Good. Tell me your name. 

A: I™m Ursu la Pawel. P-a-w-e-l. 

Q: And that was not your 
name  at birth, was it? 
A: No, my ma iden na me was 
Lenneberg, L-e-n-n-e-b-e-r-g. 
Q: And whe n -- when were you born?  Your birth -- 

A: Four 24 - 26. 

Q: Four 20 -- 

A: April 24
th
, 1926. 
Q: Uh-huh, okay. And where were you born? 

A: In Dortmund, in Germany. 

Q: And let™s talk a -- a li
ttle bit about your fa mily. 
A: Mm-h m.  

Q: Do you have any recollections of your fa mily 
before 1933 when the Nazis take over, or was it 
-- 

A: Oh yes, I do. 
Q: You do? 
A: Yes.

Q: What do you reme mb er? 
A: We ll, I reme mber the place we live d in, wh
ich was a suburb of Dort mu nd, called Aplerbeck. 
And my father was the manager of a department 
store, a chain of depart
ment stores owned by a 
Jewish concern called Ka rstadt. And I reme mber 
that department store, and I reme mber the -- 

some  of the outbuildings that hous
ed all kinds of boxes that we w
ould play in, and play house in. 
And I also reme mber learning how to ride a bi
ke. I was about seven years old, and one of the 
janitors taught me  how t o ride
 a bike. And I also reme mber wh
en my father lost his job, and 
there was a change. We  had to move  out of our 
apartment, which was above the departme nt store 
in a -- it was a huge building, because in 1933, that
 concern was, in quote, Aryanized. So my 
father really lost his job in 1933. And instead of
 leaving Germany, he bought
 a store just a few -- 
ma ybe a block up the road, and the owners of that 
store were a bit smarter. They went to South 
Africa. And I don™t reme mber this, 
but it was repeated in my fa mily
 ca -- so ma ny ti mes, that Mr. 
Rosenstein told my father that  they™re going to 
have signs on buses that Jews can™t ride a bus. 
And everybody who wa s Jewish in that town thought 
this was hilarious. This wasn™t going to -- I 
mean, what is he talking about, this guy is crazy. 

Q: Not so crazy. 

A: Not so crazy. 

Q: What was your father™s name? 

A: Otto. 

Q: And your father -- am I correct
 to say that he had one leg, th
at he had a leg amputated when 
he was a -- 

A: No, no. 

Q: It™s not true? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488

A: It was my grandfather. 
Q: Oh it was your grandfather, I see. 

A: Right. 

Q: I see. 

A: Yeah, was my grandfather, he had a leg 
amputated, and why, nobody really knows. They said 
-- there was some rumor s that he had diabetes 
and they apparently weren™t substantiated, and 

there were al so rumors in the family that the 
wrong leg was amputated. So I really have no clue, 
all I know, that my grandparents who lived in Düsse
ldorf, there was -- there were no closets in 

home s in Germany. There was a corner that had 
a curtain, and it was used
 like a -- like a closet, 
and there was a wooden leg in that corner. A
nd I was very nosey as a young child, I opened 
every drawer and every -- every, you know, I looke
d into every crevice. And I saw that wooden 

leg for the first time and it was kind of upsetting to me. 

Q: Yeah, I would imagine.  
A: Yeah. 
Q: Did you -- did you ask people about it? 

A: I™m not sure, I don™t recall. 

Q: Excuse me .  

A: Yeah. I know I wasn™t supposed to look in there. 

Q: Right. 

A: So whether I had the guts to ask -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- I ma -- I really don™t remember. 

Q: And your mother™s name ?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488

A: My mother™s name was Schneider. My mother was -- came from a Christian family. Her 
name  was Lina Caroline, after she came to th
is country, but Lina 
Schneider. And it was a 
Protestant family, supposedly, but
 later on we found out that my 
grandfather was really from a 
Catholic ba ckground, which he never admitted while
 he was alive. And my mother had been a 
buyer for a department store where she met my father
, who was also a buyer. It was not a s -- it 
was not Karstadt, it was another 
departme nt store. She had been in training as a fairly young 

woma n. In those days people didn™t go to colleg
e. In Nassau™s departme nt
 store in Dortmund, my 
grandmother went to Mr. Nassau and said that he
r -- he -- her daughter was very interested in 

clothing and in -- in -- in mode. And Mr. Nassa
u -- my -- my grandmother was a good customer, 

said, ﬁWell, why don™t you bring her along? ﬂ  And -- 
and this is where she started, and she was a 
very, very gifted woma n, it turned out later on, and this is how she ma de 
her career, as a -- first 
as a salesperson, and then she became a buyer, an
d then she became buyer like -- Karstadt is like 
Macy™s. She became a buyer at Karstadt. 
Q: And -- but your parents me t before she st
arted working at Kars
tadt, is that right? 
A: Yes, yes. 
Q: They had me t before. 

A: Yeah, they -- they me t, I don™t know exactly when. They ma rried in 1925, and my  mother 

converted to Judaism. And I was raised as a Je
w, and then my  brother was born in 1930, and he 

was -- we were both raised as Jews. 

Q: I didn™t realize that your mother ha
d converted. Wa s that unusual at the time? 
A: Wa  -- ma ybe it was for some  people, but not for my mother. Don™t forget, she really was in a 

Jewish environment fr-from -- as a fairly young 
wo ma n. She was more Jewish than my father 
was, I mean as far as Jewi sh expressions, and as 
far as the Jewish food. My father was really an 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
5 
 
 
agnostic, and my mother -- peopl
e actually, during th
e persecution, always thought my mother 
was Jewish, and not my father. 
Q: And not your father. 

A: Yeah. And -- yeah, she wa
s -- sh-she -- and actually he
r family was wonderful. My 
grandparents loved my father, and this -- especially
 her two sisters, to th
e point during the Nazi 
time where my mother™s youngest sister, as they 
always accused her that she couldn™t keep her 
mouth shut, she ended up in a work camp. So, it ju
st gives you just an 
-- and actually, my -- my 
mother™s parents were much more tolerant of that  ma rriage than my father™s parents. My Jewish 

grandmother did not like the idea of a goyt
e comi ng into her house, and even though she 
converted. 

Q: She still wasn™t Jewish to her. 

A: She wa -- she still wasn™t Je
wish, and -- and -- and the ridicul
ous part is that my grandmother 
Lenneberg, she was a total agnostic
, she didn™t keep any of the Je
wish holidays, and they were 
totally assimilated. But the idea 
that her son, her favorite son w
ould ma rry a goyte, didn™t quite 
go down we ll. Then her oldest son, Erich, who was 
really like a black sheep in the family, not a 

very good person, and who she didn™t like, but hema rried later. He me t a Catholic woma n who 

was a very good person, Erich was not. And she 
was a very strict Catholic, and she became  
pregnant before they got ma rried. And don™t 
you know that my mother -- my grandmother 
Lenneberg opened her arms  to this Catholic wo
man, even though she got pregnant before they 
got ma rried. And totally ignored all what she 
believed before, when her younger son ma rried 
Lina Schneider. 

Q: So how do you explain it? 

A: I have no explanation for this. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
6 
 
 
Q: No explanation. 
A: Neither did my aunts, my Jewish aunt
s, who loved my moth
er. Maybe there was a 
competition. 

Q: [indecipherable] 

A: I -- I have no idea, 
I really don™t know. 
Q: Tell me  about the personality of your pa
rents as you -- as you reme mb er them. We re you 
close to both of them, we re you more close -- 

A: Yes, very close to both of them. My father wa
s a very intelligent ma n, and he was a very calm 
person, he wa s loved by everybody. My mother was mu
ch aggressive than my father. They had 
two different personalities. My mother alwaysaccused my father of being too decent, too good, 

whether it was to employees, or it™s to who -- 
whoever, and I think she 
was right. And she -- she 
always felt that people were taking advantag
e ofhim. And my mother was much more 
aggressive.  
Q: But he didn™t agree with this, I gather? 
A: I don™t really know, he loved her, she could do
 anything. My father was 
totally in love with 
my mother, as long as I can reme mb er, and nobo
dy could say anything bad about my mother, so 
-- 

Q: And you were close to your mother as well? 

A: I was very close. I was -- actually, when I wa
s younger, I wa s closer to my father than to my 
mother. That doesn™t take anything away 
fr om the relationship to my mother -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- but I was, you know, I was really close to my
 father. And some  of it stemme d fr om the fact 
that my father was quite athl
etic, and my mother was not, an
d Jupp Geschind, who was kind of a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
7 
 
 
janitor at Karstadt, he taught me  how to ride a bi
ke. It was an adult bike, and my par e nts didn™t 
know about that, and I put my leg kind of th
rough -- you know, how I ma
naged it, I don™t know. 
And then I eventually got a wonderful bike, and 
we went on bike trips, but always with my 
father, and actually my c ousin, my father™s si
ster™s daughter, who spent a lot of time in our 
house. My father tried to teach my mother how 
to bike, but it was alwa
ys a disaster. And she 
screamed once he was trying to kill her, so she al
ways -- as long as she knew that he was holding 
onto the back of the bike it was fine. 
As soon as he let go, she would fall. 
Q: So you did ma ny more things with your father? 
A: Many mo re things as far as hiking
 and bicycle riding with my father. 
Q: Did you eat lunch together, 
and dinner?  What was -- what 
was the process in the house? 
A: Yes, we -- we did, because lunch at that ti
me  in Germany was the ma in meal, and when we 

lived in Aplerbeck, children used to go home  to
 eat, and my parents lived above the departme nt 
store, they had a ma id, and they would go up and ha
ve their -- their lunch, their dinner, at lunch 
time. 

Q: Right. 

A: And I would join them, both of us
, my brother and I would join them. 
Q: We re you glad when your
 brother arrived in 1930? 
A: I think so. I don™t remember. 
I loved him dearly afterwards. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: I don™t really reme mb er how 
I felt, you know. I know that I was 
crazy about him when he was 
a little bit bigger, and not quite
 a tiny baby, but was toddling ar
ound, and I was very protective of 
him. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
8 
 
 
A: Yeah. 
Q: And wha t  was his name ?  

A: Walter. 

Q: Walter. 

A: And I™ve always vowed I would never name  a 
child after a relative who was killed or  died, 
because my brother was named after the oldest so
n of my grandmother, who was killed in World 
War  
1
. 
Q: So you -- you™re a bit superstitious. 

A: I really am not, there is
 just some thing about -- 
Q: About that? 

A: -- you know, I would not consider nami ng -- ya
 -- but Hans feels the same  way, when I got 
pregnant, that we would name  e
ither David or Bruce after his fa
ther, or -- or my father. Plus 
there was something -- I didn™t like German very 
much after I came  out of the camps. Everything 
German was an antithesis to me . And so any 
-- I mean, na me s like Adolf, for goodness sakes, no 
-- which my  grandfather was Adolf Lenneberg. 

Q: Right. 

A: And Otto was my fat her™s name . 

Q: So how -- how was the house religious
ly, since your mother converted -- 
A: Mm-h m 

Q: -- because your father was agnostic and very assimilated -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- did you celebrate holidays? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
9 
 
 
A: We  did. At -- at times we celebrated both Ch
ristma s -- we always celebrated Hanukah, and 
my father used to call the Christma s tree the 
Hanukah bush. And that was really more done for 
our Christian relatives, who always came. Seder we
 went to Jewish friends. And I couldn™t go to 
a Seder after I came out of the camps  for years an
d years and years, because this was a couple, 
they had no children, and we always had Seder 
with them, and my brother used to ask the 
questions. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: So I just couldn™t -- 

Q: You couldn™t do it. 

A: -- couldn™t -- Seder -- Passover was a terrible time for me. 

Q: Right. 

A: All the ho -- Jewish holidays were. 

Q: Because of the me mo
ries associated, okay. 
A: The me mories, and I was much more -- I went 
through phases of being quite religious, and in 
1934, I went to a Jewish school in Dortmund becau
se I could not attend public school in -- in 
Aplerbeck any more. It was not a good school, and 
I wasn™t -- didn™t become  a Zionist then, but 
then eventually my parents de
cided to move to Düsseldorf, 
where my father was born. Also, 
Aplerbeck was a small town, and very anti-Semitic. Many Nazis ther e. Boycotts in fr ont of the 

store, don™t buy from the Jew, et
cetera. And then my father did 
sell that store, but I can™t 
reme mber exactly, I think it was about 1936, and Dü
sseldorf had a private Jewish school, a very 
good school, and that was one of the reasons my father wanted to go to Düsseldorf, he was 

brought up there, it was a much larger, more co
smopolitan city, and it had a good school system. 

And that™s when I became  an ardent Zionist, and 
very religious, to the ch
agrin of my parents. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
10 
 
 
Very upset when my fri e nds in Jewish school pr
etended to be fasting 
for Yom Kippur  and were 
really cheating. I -- and I -- I 
went through that stage. I ra
n around Jewish ho -- houses and 
apartments, and collected for KKL for money for 
Israel to plant trees, etcetera. So you kind of 
get the pi ctur e.  
Q: What is KKL, can you explain? 

A: KKL?  I don™t reme mber what it stood for, but 
we call it KKL. There were blue boxes that had 
a Magen da -- David -- David on it,
 and they would put coins in it,
 and that would be eventually 
sent what was then Palestin
e to make the desert bloom. 
Q: Right. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Right. Now, explain some thing to
 me . You were born in Dortmund?  
A: Yes. 

Q: Yes. And you lived there. Do yo -- you -- 
A: No, I li -- I never lived in Dortmu nd. I lived
 in Aplerbeck, which was a suburban town, but 
Dortmund had much better hospitals, so the -- 
Q: I see. 

A: -- obstetrician my mo ther went to was going --
 was in Dortmund, there 
were better physicians 
in Dortmund, and I w -- the delivery took place in
 a hospital in Dortmund. 
So my birth certificate 
says Dortmu nd, but I never really lived in Dortmu nd.  

Q: Right. 

A: And I did go to school -- to Jewish school 
in Dortmund, because I coul dn™t go to public 

school in -- to any public school any more. 

Q: After ™33. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
11 
 
 
A: After -- yeah, I think it was about ™34. 
Q: Uh-huh. But your first school was in Aplerbeck -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: Right?  

A: That was a grade school, and -- and talki
ng about reme mbering, some how I do reme mber I 
had two very good friends. Now, I was about seven years old, and one was the daughter of the 

principal of a school, and one was a daughter of 
a local physician. And after the Nazis took over, 
and I don™t recall exactly how soon, but
 within a relatively shor t time period -- we used to run to 

each other™s houses and play, and I came  to thei
r house one day and they informed me, these two 

girls, that they couldn™t play with me  any mo
re because I was a Jew. Now that I remember, 
because it made such an impression on me, and I 
didn™t make -- I -- I di dn™t understand it. And I 
think I asked my parents, and I do not reme mber 
what their answer was, but some how it was an 
experience that I still reme mber, that all of a s
udden I lost my friends. I couldn™t play with these 
two girls. I still have pictures 
of these two girls with me , and I wouldn™t have had those pictures, 
but the non-Jewish relatives -- whatever I have, 
after I came back, was on account of my aunts, 
or I wouldn™t have a thing. 

Q: Do you reme mber if these kids were angry, did 
they yell at you, or did 
they say it quietly -- 
A: That I don™t reme mbe r . 

Q: -- you don™t reme mbe r .  

A: I think they just said you can™t
 come  here any more, we -- yeah, they said you -- we  can™t play 
with you any more because you are a Jew. 

Q: And the friends that you had were a mi xture of
 friends, Jewish and Christian friend, I gather? 
A: In -- in do -- in Aplerbeck? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
12 
 
 
Q: A -- yes. 
A: I think there were a k -- ther
e were a couple of Jewish kids, 
I don™t remember the m too well, 
but a lot of the fa milies I reme mber either  had children who were older, or -- or the Kahns, like, 

had no children, and they treated 
me like their own child. So I 
really don™t have any deep 
impression of friendship with a Jewi sh child in Aplerbeck. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Now, that changed in Düsseldorf. 

Q: In Düsseldorf, yes. 

A: But even the children at th
e Jewish school in Dortmund, t hey 
were -- they didn™t make very 
deep impressions on me. 

Q: Mm-hm. Were your 
parents good humored? 
A: Yes, yes. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: Yes, yes, they were, they were. I think -- 
I think what helped me  
survive was the childhood I 
had. I think if there is an id
eal childhood, I had it. And my pa
rents were very loving, and the 
ma in thing is they were totally in love  with 
each other, which I did not appreciate when I was a 
child, but as time went on, and I remember their -- 
the way they acted with each other, and the 
way my father suffered when he was separated 
fr o m my  mo t h e r ,  a n d  t h e s a me  fo r  my  mo t h e r . 
Q: Then what do you think that gave you? 
A: First of all, my father was an extremely 
honest person. Morally caring, whether it was for his 
fa mily, for the people who worked for him. And 
I think that ma de an i mpression on me , the way 
he interact ed with his not -- non-Jewish relatives
, and his Jewish relatives. And his helpfulness. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
13 
 
 
A: One doesn™t appreciate it when one is eight, nine or 10 years old. And -- and the way he cared 
for us in Terezín. There was only one theme, when
 this murderer is gone, and we get back with 
your mo mmy, you know. And there was th -- he talk
ed about my mother every day. So even 

though we were separated, that was the f -- th
e foremost thing on his mi nd, was my mother. 
When we were in Terezín, and my --  my brot
her was Bar-mitzvah™d in Terezín, and my father 
was an agnostic. But there is some thing about 
agnostic Jews, and I don™t know what it is. There 
is a Jewishness that -- that you -- you mi ght be an 
agnostic, but there is some thing mo re than the 
religion. And ma ybe it was also because we were in
 Terezín that the Bar-
mitzvah of my brother 
meant so mu ch to us. It mi ght -- mi ght not have 
meant as mu ch to us if we would have not had 
the -- Hitler™s ca -- catastrophe. 

Q: Was it unusual for a woman who was a mother
 -- excuse me  -- to be working the way your 
mother was? Wa s that unusual? 

A: Yeah, my mother was unusual in every way. 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: You know, she was unusual in every way. Yes, wh
en -- when my father accepted the job that 
was offered to him by Karstadt to be in charge 
of this whole department store, and my mother 
was ma de the chief buyer for wome n™s and childr
en™s clothing, there was no question that she 
would continue doing that. My father just accepted 
that, or  encouraged he r. She had a ma id, and 
her youngest sister came  quite often to help out
, and was the recipient of a lot of good deeds 
from my father. I think she was really in love 
with my father, too. So that™s more or less the 
atmosphere -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- I grew up in. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
14 
 
 
Q: So you did have a ma id, it was this -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- gre -- this was Grete? 

A: Grete, yeah. 

Q: Grete?  

A: Grete yeah, she -- she was -- she worked for 
us until it became impossible, when the fi rst 
Nuremberg laws came out that Jewish men were
 accused after that of having affairs with non-
Jewish women, and ended up incarcerated. We  didn™
t talk about concentration camps in those 

days, but that was a great fear ma ny Jewish me
n had, that they were accused of having sexual 

relations with non-Jewish wome n, a nd especially
 a maid who was a live-in maid. So -- and I 
know Grete, when she left, she cr
ied like a child. But it was just t
oo dangerous to have her there. 
Q: Right. 

A: I mean s he -- she did join us in -- a few bu
ildings down when my -- my father and my mother 
unfortunately bought that store, a
nd -- Steinweg, but they v -- th
ey had to let her go, they just 
couldn™t keep her. 

Q: Did you mi ss her? 

A: Yes. I mi ssed her. She was -- she was part of the fa mily. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: I mean, I grew up with her. 

Q: Right. 

A: Yeah.  

Q: So would you have considered your fa mily 
fairly wealthy, or well-
to-do, how would you have 
described it? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
15 
 
 
A: I think they were well-to-do. They were not w
ealthy that they had enormous wealth inherited 
from their parents. I think they lived pretty 
high. They went on vacations, they had beautiful 
furniture. Th -- I™m sure they ma de enormous 
a mounts of money, both of them together. They 
had wonderful paintings, and especially at Karsta
dt, I mean, they had an enormous flat up there 
with uncountable rooms, and Pers
ian rugs, and it was very luxu
rious, which I didn™t -- I mean, it 
didn™t strike me  as luxurious
, I was used to it, you know. 
Q: Right, right. 

A: Whereasmy grandmotherin Dortmund, my mother
™s mother and father, lived in a very nice 
house, in an apartment, a house that had ma ybe 
three stories. And it wa
s comfortable, and was 
nice, but it wasn™t nowhere as l
uxurious as my parents. I -- my
 father had a study with bookcases 
full of books, and it was -- you know, it was a different world, yeah. 

Q: Right, right. We  have to change the tape now. 

A: Okay.

Beginning Ta pe Two 
Q: Ursula, I want to go back to th
e f -- your first y
ear of school -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- or your second year of school, you -- you got so
me  sort of tuberculosis of the lymph node?  
Of the lymp h glands, yes? 

A: Yeah, which was actually almost like kinderg
ar ten, and I don™t recall exactly when it was. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: My grandmother, my  non -- my Christian 
grandmother came from
 Hessen, which is an 
agricultural area 
not too far from Kas sel. And it was t
hought at the time  that during vacation, 
summer vacation, that was the healthiest pl ace to 
send your children. So this was actua lly before 
the Nazis came  into power, I was sent  to Gr
abenst ein, which is a small village where my 
grandmother was born, on summer vacation. And they
 had wonderful milk, raw milk, came  right 
from the cows. Unpasteurized milk, they didn™t us
e pasteurization there. A
nd what is interesting 
is that my mother also spent her vacation in 
Grabenstein as a young girl, and she had a -- a 
condition in her groin where her lymp h gland had 
to be lanced, and then she had a condition in 
her -- on her neck, too. But it was never connected 
that this came from tuberculous cows. It™s 
called scrofula, and I had a neck out like this, and 
it -- it was here, where I have a scar and it was 
in the front of my neck that 
-- these lymph glands were all pu
s-y, and I we nt through this for 
more than a year. And my -- my mot her was treat
ed by a country physician who just lanced this 
with a knife, and she had a beautiful, straight scar. And my parents took me  to Berlin to a 

specialist, who extracted the pus with a syringe
, and consequently I am left  with all this 
calcifications in there. But I lost a year of school, at least. 

Q: Do you reme mber being in bed a great deal? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
17 
 
 
A: No, what I reme mber -- no, I wasn™t in bed, what I reme mber is some  horrible stuff, which I 
still reme mb er the name , believe it or not, antifl
ogestine, which was like a gook in a -- a little 
can, that had to be heated very t -- very hot. It 
was -- and then it had to be applied to my  glands. 
It was like putting hot compresses on some thing. I 
hated that stuff. I mean, it burned, and it was -
- and I screamed even be fore they could put it 
on my glands. So that™s what I reme mb er, but I 
don™t reme mber too mu ch, and then one day it just
 seemed to -- to clear up, and it wa -- the 
glands were still draining a bit,
 and there was like a -- a band-aid 
on it, and then I went to school 
with it. 

Q: But you were out of school for almost a year? 

A: Yes.  

Q: Did that -- 

A: And I was tutored. I was -- 

Q: Oh, you were tutored at home? 
A: -- tutored at home. 
Q: So you didn™t lose the -- the year of sc
hool, you were able to stay at your -- 
A: No, I was tutored, I was tutored from -- in Je
wi sh school, Fr au Buchheim, who was the wife 
of the principal of the school, 
and she would tutor me  at my 
grandparents home in Dortmund. 
See, I had to commute to Dortmund t o the Jewi
sh school. We  lived in Aplerbeck, but I couldn™t 
go to public school any more. 

Q: But in ™36, you moved to Düsseldorf. 

A: No -- in ™36 we move d to Düsseldorf. 

Q: Yes. Now, do you reme mber as a little kid 
in 1933, when the Nazis came  in, did you see -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
18 
 
 
A: Yes, I do. I do reme mber it, because they were -- had this -- the bl ack uniforms, and also gr -- 
brown uniforms, the either SS or the SR. And I 
reme mber them standing in front of our -- our 
door to -- to the -- the door to 
the -- the entrance to the store, a
nd threatening people. And I also 
reme mber the atmosphere. My parents were very
 upset, so was Grete, 
our ma id, and who saids 
all kinds of dirty words about them. And I picked 
all that up. It didn™t ma ke sense to me , but 
some thing changed, something happened. And I re
me mber my parents talking about that no -- 
customers weren™t comi ng into the store because th
ey were being threatened. They stood right in 
front of -- of the entrance to the store, a
nd any person who wanted to enter the store was 
intimidated by them. And then they used to -- 
they defaced the store windows with Jude, Jew. 

Don™t buy from the Jew. So I reme mber that.  

Q: You do? 

A: And I reme mber them s mashing windows, that I 
reme mb er. In fact, I think I was in the store 
one day when these thugs smashed one of the bi
g st -- windows, and it c -- it just came crashing 
down. And they did that to all the Jewish stores. 

Q: And this was during the boycott of 19 thir -- 
not that you would have known at the time that 
there was a boycott in 1933. 

A: No, I didn™t know, I didn™t -- 
you know, this -- all of a s
udden -- there was a wonderful, 
tranquil life, which was changed some what because
 we mo ved from Karstadt  to the Steinweg 
place, but that didn™t regi ster to me  why we di d, or what, but then, this did regist er. And also 

those two girls, I coul
dn™t play with -- 
Q: Right, right. 

A: -- the two girls any more. And they were 
at our house a lot. I mean, I have a lot of 
photographs with them. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
19 
 
 
Q: So, did life become  l onely, or did 
you have a big enough family so that -- 
A: I don™t think I -- I really felt 
very deprived. My -- my mot her™s
 sisters were all so wonderful, 
and my grandmother. I mean, there™s nobody like 
my mother™s mother. And I just felt very 
sheltered with them. And then when I had to go 
to school in Dortmund, a nd I spent an awful lot 
of time with my mother™s pare
nts, because Frau Buchheim would come  to my grandmother™s 
house, and would tutor me at my gr andmother™s 
house, because it was in 
the same  town. And I 
would eat with them, and I would 
-- she would take me to the mark
ets, and I -- I j -- I just don™t 
reme mber fe eling deprived at all. 

Q: And whe n you moved to Düsseldorf, what di -- 

A: That changed my life  completely. 

Q: How so? 

A: Because I went to a school, a Jewi sh school, 
and somehow I made an awful lot of friends. I 
had never been in a -- in a school that I felt so 
good about. I -- I ma de a lo
t of -- a lot of friends, 
and I went to their houses, they went to mi ne, and I was good in athletics, and they had a big 

athletic program, and I was good in jumping and 
si -- all kinds of thi
ngs. And they had arts 
programs, they did a lot of things. And even 
though the Nazis were pe
rsecuting the Jews, but 
some how there was still that feeli
ng, well this guy isn™t going to stay
 in power, and at -- and I felt 
sheltered. I was among people who were teachi
ng me , and who were very -- were very 
wonderful. And we had one professo
r who later on I me t in Los Angeles, Dr. Bergel, and he was 
a professor of history, and they really had attr
acted terrific people in 
that school. And he had 
traveled extensively in Africa, in Asia, and he 
told us all these wonderf
ul stories, I reme mber 
that. Yeah, that was a -- it was a good 
time until 1938, when our school was destroyed 
completely. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
20 
 
 
Q: Oh, it was destroyed? 
A: Kristallnacht. Compl e tely burned to the gr
ound, our school, our synagogue, everything, yeah. 
Q: But when you moved to Düsseldorf, your father, 
he has a business in Düsseldorf, or he works 
-- 

A: No, see, my father used the money which he received from the people who bought that 

Steinwegs -- that second -- that
 store he bought. They were very decent family, a Catholic 
fa mily, and they really paid him the ma rket price. 

Q: Really? 

A: They did. And I would never -- my mother 
would never do anything to get any more money 
out of them, because she felt they were decent, which was very hard to find. Most of the 

Germans who bought Jewish stores
 were cheated, but my pa rents were not. And then he -- 
ma ybe he -- I would have been better off if -- they would have been better off if they had been 

cheated, because he took the -- the money from 
that stor e, when he came to Düsseldor f, he 
started a wholesale store not too far from the ra
ilroad station. Not in the 
best area of town, but 
that™s where the wholestale businesse s were
. And that flourished, everything he touched 

flourished. 

Q: Even in spite of the fact that  th
e Nazis are in power for three years -- 

A: Oh yes, he -- he had a -- and a lot of these pe
ople were not really N
azis. And some  of them 

turned Nazis, but they we re -- you know, he ha
d a -- also, he has a -- had a good rapport. Lot of 

them were people who sold door to door, and some
 of the m were Gypsies, who bought from hi m.  
And I wish he hadn™t bought that store, but that™s
 what he did. In the meantime they tried to 
emigrate. You know, they tried to leave Germany, 
but they had to ma ke a living. I don™t think 
my parents had, you know, tremendous money r e serv
es. They had lived pretty high, and all this 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
21 
 
 
moving, and losing his job, and losing his -- his hea
lth insurance and stuff, and having to buy all 
this on his own -- 
Q: Cost [indecipherable] 

A: -- I™m sure that there was a cost. 

Q: Right. But your mother went -- after you mo ved 
to Düsseldorf, she goes to Berlin and gets a 
job?  

A: She tries to. She goes to Berlin
 to visit her old colleagues, w
ho used to be -- who were buyers 
for other departme nt stores. And some  of the m 
had been working for ma nufacturers. But by that 

time, everything was, in quote, Aryanized, and th
ey weren™t working for Jewish concerns any 
more. And they treated her horribly. They didn™t 
want to have anything to do with her. Whether 
they were just horrible pe ople, or whether 
they -- it was self-protection, because having 
connections with Jews -- and my mother gene
rally wasn™t even known that she came from a -- 
from a -- a non-Jewish family. Fr -- my mother was a Jew. 
Q: To everybody. 
A: To her colleagues. 

Q: I see. 

A: To everybody. And so, my mother comi ng back 
and trying to get -- make some  connections 
to earn a living, di -- it wa s a fa
ilure. And she was very dishearte
ned. And then she -- and I don™t 
know how s he got to the Schreyecks, that 
I don™t know. She mi ght have told me, I don™t 
reme mber that. She became a forelady in a 
leather belt factory which was owned by the 
Schreyeck fa mily. And they were the most d
ecent, wonderful people on this earth. And they 
protected her, and I -- they s -- I-I don™t want to
 jump ahead, I think I™ll let you ask the questions, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
22 
 
 
but they were very vital later 
on in -- in protecting my mother
 when we we re deported, and the 
secret police, Herr Puetz, would not let my 
mothe r  to go with us. So, they™re wonder -- 
Q: And you think that had some thing to do with th
ese people?  The fact that she was not allowed 
to go? 

A: I don™t think so. I thin
k -- what had to do with him not wan
ting my mot her to go with us was 
strictly he hated her because he -- she got notif
ication a few time s, that I reme mber, to present 
herself at the office of Herr Puetz, he was the he
ad of the Gestapo. And he belabored her to leave 
my father. And she ma de  it very clear she would 
never leave my father, she rather die. And he 
then would not allow her to go with us -- we -- 
to the, in quote, labor camp. And she  worked for 
the Schreyecks. So as soon as we were gone, this
 guy Puetz came , I think on a weekly basis, to 
interview her, and to interview the Schreyecks, an
d to ma ke it very, very difficult, to make her 
feel very threatened, to the poi
nt where Mr. Schreyeck one day said to my mother, ﬁCaroline, 
this guy is after you. He will get to you whether it™s next  week or the week after. You have to 
leave. I have a brother, as you know, in Vienna, 
and he has a leather fact
ory. I™m going to get in 
touch with my brother and I think he will agr
ee to shield you, and you work for my brother.ﬂ 
That wasn™t easy, because when you lee -- left a 
town, and I think it™s probably still so in 
Germany, you had to go to the police, you had to fill out papers that you were leaving such and 

such a residence, and you were going to such and such a town, where you were going to live in 

such and such a place. Then when you got, let™s 
say, to Vienna , you were supposed to go to the 

Viennese police and start pape
rs that you were a new reside
nt. Now, what  they took upon 
themselves --  this is why I said to you before, 
these people did things that I am not sure I would 
have the guts to do for anybody. They provided 
food for my mother, so she wouldn™t have -- 
because she was not registered, 
she wouldn™t get food stamps . They
 provided a place for her to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
23 
 
 
live with a family where she had a room. And sh
e  was not registered with the police, and the 
Germans ha d no idea where she went. And Puetzcame, she found out later, to Schreyeck in 
Düsseldorf, and said where -- they wa nt to talk
 to her. And Mr. Schrey
eck said, ﬁI have no idea 
where she went. I hope she isn™t going to take he r life, because she was talking about killing 

herself,ﬂ and stuff like that. And she stayed with 
the Schreyecks in Vienna for quite a long time, 
and -- you know, there™s so ma ny ba d things happened
 to my  mother, but this is almost unreal. I 
think she had the flu, or some thing, but sh -- anywa
y, my mo ther wasn™t one to stay home  if she 

just had a little cold, but she wa
s sick. And she stayed home, and that da y when she stayed home, 
the Gestapo came to the Schreyeck factory in Vi
enna and asked for Karolina Lenneberg. So, Mr. 
Schreyeck number two, the one in Vienna send 
some body he t r usted, I don™t
 know who it was, to 
her -- to her room, and told her to
 imme diately leave, take the next
 train to Kleve, which is close 
to the Dutch border, where a third Schreyeck
 brother had a tannery. So -- and then -- 
Q: This is like the underground railroad. 
A: Exactly. And then the -- and th
e -- he -- she worked for the Schreyecks I -- only for several 
months I think. And the bombing attacks were gett
ing horrendously bad in Kleve. I me an, this is 
historical, what was -- th -- it was almost flatte
ne d, because there was also
 -- lot of industry in 
Kleve, and al so it was a very short trip for the British fliers, cause it was cl ose to the Dutch 
border. And one day the house next to the Schrey
eck™s was bombed. It was one of those bombs 
that went into the baseme nt and then expl
oded. And Mr. Schreyeck said to my mother, 
ﬁCaroline, you have a sister in
 Lippborg. Why -- I think you should 
leave. I don™t th
ink any of us 
are going to survive.ﬂ And my mother left, and th
e day my mother left, all the Schreyecks were 
killed in their cellar. One of th
e bombs went into their baseme nt. 
Q: Oh my. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
24 
 
 
A: And this is why -- you know, you 
talk about justice, and -- a
nd belief in God, and all this, 
which my mother had lost completely -- the Sc
hreyecks in Düsseldorf had a wonderful son, and 
they were such anti-Nazis. Th
eir son was killed. He was draf
ted, and he was killed. And, you 
know, these -- the good people -- 
Q: Often get hurt, yes. 

A: Right. 

Q: We ll, that™s quite a story of your mother™s, now let™s get back t-to you. So until -- until 

Kristallnacht  -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- you seemed to feel pretty good. You™re 
not feeling -- although you must an -- you must 
know that your parents are in some  wa
ys nervous about what™s happening -- 
A: Oh, I was -- 

Q: -- and they tried to leave. You™re very conscious of this. 
A: -- I was very conscious of it and also, my pare nts prepared both my br other and me  to -- for 
immi gration. Our suitcases were practically pack
ed. We  got English lessons, I got fr -- English 
and Spanish lessons from an uncle of mi ne who 
al so perished, who was a philologist, he s -- he 
spoke ma ny languages. And my brother also got a
dditional e -- when e -- we had English in s -- 

in school, but he got additiona l lessons. My parents had what was called an affidavit, which is a 

pledge from an American citizen to bring ove
r a person from another country, and that they 
would take care of that person if that person woul
d not be able to be financially self-sufficient. 
The idea is that this person will not become a -- will not use the soci al services of the United 

States. So we  had this affidavit of a very dist
ant relative in Chicago, Beifuss. And my  parents 
had a numbe r. To -- to get an in
terview with the Amer
ican consul in Düsseldorf you had to have 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
25 
 
 
a number. And the waiting time before you could s
ee a consul was between a year and a year and 
a half. So they had obtained that affidavit a l
ong time before they saw the consul. They saw the 
consul in 1938. I don™t recall when it was, whet
her it was the beginning or the mi ddle of ™38. 
And the consul, who was known not to be too favor
ably inclined towards the Jews, like s -- it 
turned out later some people in 
the state departme nt were, he d
ecided that the affidavit that 
Morris Beifuss gave my  mother and my father wa
s okay, but they -- he considered it insufficient 
because Mr . Beifuss had given X number of affi da
vits to othe r people. And they wanted an 
additional affidavit from somebody other than Mr. 
de -- Mr. Beifuss. Now, Mr. Beifuss was an 
extremely wealthy ma n, who lived on one of the ma
in, glorious streets near the lake, and that 
broke our neck. So my fa ther wrote to a very 
distant relative nobody liked, who lived in Texas, 
and who had come  to Ge rmany on oc casion. And 
he was an alcoholic, and he hated everybody 
who didn™t drink with him. And my 
father was sure he was --  gotten into bad situation with this 
ma n because he would not drink with him. We ll, he
 declined to give us an affidavit. And -- so 
you get the picture. My parents th
en tried to go to Uruguay. And it wa
sn™t just my parents, it was 
a cousin of theirs and anothe
r couple. And they fell into th
e hands of a smuggler, a very good 
looking young ma n who -- who was such a con artis
t, he persuaded everybody. Plus, they didn™t 
have too ma ny options. They gave him a lot of m
oney, and then he disapp
eared. So that -- that 
was -- what they should have done, I think, they 
should have just taken what they had on their 
backs and just tried to go eith
er through France -- or France wa s already occupied, ma ybe, when 
was France -- I -- no, they could have gone throug
h France, maybe to -- to Spain, etcetera. Some  
people ma naged to do that, but they didn™t do that
, all right?  So they still hoped for writing and 

getting on the additional affidav
it and nothing panned out, and then it was ™38, and then was 
Kristallnacht , and -- and after that  it only went downhill. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
26 
 
 
Q: Did you know people who had l-left in that 
wa y?  Just taken what was on their backs and 
crossed -- tried to cross the border? 
A: After the war. 

Q: After the war, you had, but you -- 

A: I didn™t know anybody who did 
it during the war, I mean not 
among our friends. But after the 
war, actually there was a -- a c
ousin of my husband, she was ma rri
ed to a Polish Jew, who was a 
watchmaker, and he couldn™t ma ke a go of a
nything, it was a wonderful guy. And they came to 
this country like that. And then 
he, first time in his life he had 
a wonderful job with Longine, and 
then he died of a bleeding 
ulcer. So you know, life is -- yeah, some ti me s you can™t win. 
Q: Did -- do you reme mber having 
conversations with your parent
s, were your parents telling 
you we™re trying to go to -- 

A: Oh yes. 

Q: -- United States, to Uruguay? 
A: Oh yes, I -- by that time I was ol d enough -- 
Q: Yes, you -- 

A: -- not only old enough, my mother was work
ing, my father was working by that time  in 
Tiefbau, which means very hard labor, for wh
ich he probably didn™t get paid, you know, digging 
ditches, and construction, which was compulsory work because  he had to gi ve up his store in 

Düsseldorf, his wholesale store, because then 
an edict came out that Jews couldn™t have -- 
couldn™t own businesses any more. And then he was 
drafted to -- to work in -- in Tiefbau, which 
was digging basements and etcetera, and I don™t 
know exactly for what. And I don™t think he -- 
he got paid at all for that. 

Q: So do you feel your circumstances getting worse and worse -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
27 
 
 
A: Oh yes. 
Q: -- physically, because of the experiences? 

A: Oh yes, and -- and I was -- and then my -- 
our school was burned, and -- and there was -- we 
had very limited education. And there was only on
e teacher and his wife left, and there was a 
laundry, the Elsberg laundry in --
 outside of Düsseldorf, and th
ese people allowed us to have 
school there. There were only, you know, relative
ly few people. There was not an accredited 
school any more, because some  people sent  their ch
ildren to Duisberg, which was -- still ha d an 
accredited Jewish school, and my brother went
 to Duisberg on the train, and got special 
permission to take the train because Jews weren™
t allowed to go in the train any more. And so 
this is -- you know, I wi -- I -- th
en I had no more  education, and I kept house for my parents, 
who were working very hard from morning to night. 

Q: Cause there™s no ma id any mo
re, there™s no [indecipherable] 
A: There™s nothing, you know, there was no ma id afte
r -- after we went to Düsseldorf. Things 
went downhill ve ry, very fa st, yeah. 

Q: Are you frightened at this 
point?  Do you th -- do you have 
any recollection whether you™re 
frightened, or -- 

A: I was never frightened. I always had thatfeeling that my parent
s go -- they were trying 

everything. They were going to get us out of 
this. And I was also very busy, I was learning 
English, I wa s learning Spanish, I wa s keeping hous
e, I was taking care of my brother, who was 
four years younger than I was. A
nd there was still that hope that 
this criminal is
 going to -- 
Q: To stop. 

A: -- to stop, is going to be ki
lled or some thing. And I reme mber
 in the last apartment we had, 
we -- my father -- this -- there 
were all non-Jews in that apartment, it was a most primi tive 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
28 
 
 
apartment, but on the top floor was a couple, a
nd he was a communist. And he was very anti-
Nazi. And when we went into the baseme nts whe n th
ere was an alarm, an ai
r -- ai r st rike alar m, 
my father and this ma n would be listening to th
e foreign senders. And 
it didn™t look good at that 
time. Yeah, yeah. 
Q: Okay, we have to stop 
and tape -- change the tape. 
A: Yeah, I thought so. 
End of Tape Two

Beginning Ta pe Three 
Q: Ursula, by 1938, have you, as a young person, been hearing about 
concentration camps?  
A: No. 
Q: Nothing? 

A: Nothing, nothing. 

Q: And you didn™t hear about
 people being taken away? 
A: Yes, people were taking aw -- being taken 
away, but nobody ever me ntioned concentration 
camps. You know, the -- the Gesta
po did incarcerate people, but 
some how it did not sink through 
where these people were going. It 
was taken for granted they were
 going to some  prisons, people 
were imprisoned. And not only Jews, but political pr
isoners. I reme mber distinctly I was in my 

grandmother Schenider™s house, who would go 
to church every Sunday morning, to a big 
Christian church, Evangelische Kirche in Do
rtmund. And my grandfather was suffering from 
cancer. And they were very fond of a mi nister 
who would visit my grandfa t her. And one day I 
was there on a Sunday, my grandmother come s ho
me , her red -- her eyes are red, she is beyond 

herself because the -- the mi nister was taken 
off by black shirts when he was giving a sermon. 

And what he was telling his congr
egation is that they should be 
more tolerant, and what™s going 
on with the Jews was incomprehensible to him.
 And two black shirts 
came  up, took him off the 
podium -- I mean, off the whatever
 you call it in a -- in
 a Protestant church, and he was never 
heard from a gain. And my -- my aunts told me  
that they heard that he was killed in a 
concentration camp. So t hat has ma de a tremend
ous impression on me at that time, I reme mber 
that. And that was, you know, ma ny
, ma ny years before people were
 routinely put into custody.  
Q: Right. 

A: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
30 
 
 
Q: But did they say the word concentration camp? 
A: No. 

Q: They didn™t -- 

A: No. 

Q: -- they just said -- 

A: It wasn™t part 
of our vocabulary. 
Q: I see, right. 

A: No. 

Q: Were you worried about Walter traveling 
by hims elf on the train to go to the school? 
A: I wasn™t, maybe my pa
rents were, but I wasn™t. 
Q: And he came back and forth every day? 

A: Right, yeah, he came back and forth every day. 

Q: And wha t  was it like for -- 
A: But he -- but -- but don™t fo
rget, we  didn™t wear this Jewi
sh star yet at that time . 
Q: Right, right. 
A: So, you know, it™s not too clear that anybody w
ould have known that he was a Jewish child. 
Q: Did -- but there was an a -- an I.D. card? 

A: Yes -- 

Q: Was it -- 

A: -- we had I.D. cards. 

Q: And didn™t that say Jewish, or not? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
31 
 
 
A: And that said Jewish, I mean, if some body 
would stop you, but how 
many people would have 
stopped a young boy and asked for the I.D. card?  Bu
t that stop in -- that
 school in Duisberg 
closed, probably not too long, ma ybe  six m
onths or some thing after Kristallnacht. 
Q: I see. 
A: I don™t know exactly, I don™
t remember that too well. 

Q: Do you reme mber Kristallnacht? 

A: Oh yes, oh yes, I reme mber it very well. I remember it because some body, and I don™t 

reme mber who it was, I think it probably was this
 neighbor of my parents, came down and told 
my mother to hide my fa ther. And he was in a 
closet, and they never came into our house, as it 
turned out. And they -- a lot of
 me n were being taken away, my 
-- my stepfather was taken away 
in Düsseldorf, my father was not. I™m not sure
 that he hid in our 
house, or some body else™s 
house, that I don™t reme mber. All I reme mber distinc
tly is there was a raid before Kristallnacht, I 
think just a short time  before Kristallnacht, 
where they went through Jewish homes and looked 
for, in quote, forbidden books. Now, forbi
dden books weren™t necessarily books by Jewish 

authors. Anyone who was who in literature wa
s a forbidden book, whether it was Bernard Shaw, 
or what. And I will never forget this, my father was -- downstairs in the basement there was a 

wash cellar, and a big stove where people would 
boil their wash in those days. And my  father 
was burning books, and he was practically cryi ng. And h -- he said to me , ﬁI am getting rid of my 

old friends.ﬂ And these were his books, because 
they were going through Jewish homes, and if 
you had a book that was on the forbidden list, fo
rget it, they would arrest you. Now that I 
r e me mb e r .  

Q: So you watched him do that? 

A: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
32 
 
 
Q: Wa s this very sad for you too, or was 
it sad because you saw how unhappy he was? 
A: He was very unhappy, and whenever he was unhappy it wa s very, very sad for me . 
Q: Right. 

A: You know, it -- it -- I mean, you sense when your 
parents are upset. I also sensed that my 
parents were trying so hard to get us out of
 Ger many. And I reme mber maps on the floor, and 
studying South America, and ur -- Ur uguay, and pl
aces like that, that they were hope there -- 
hope they were going to go, with their cousins. So -- 

Q: Okay, we have to stop the 
tap -- is -- okay. [interruption] 
Oh, I™m sorry, I was confused.  
A: Mm-h m.  

Q: What did you see on Kristallnacht?  Did you see 
anything that night, or 
did you go out the next 
day and see the destruction? 

A: We nt out the next day and sa
w the destruction. My parents woul
dn™t let us go out of -- get out 
of our apartment. I me a n, my mother, I think. 
I don™t know, I think my fa ther was -- some body, 
probably that couple upstairs
, the communists probably had 
him in their apartment. 
Q: Now let me  ask you some thing. Your fr -- peopl
e are wanting to protect your father because 
he™s known as Jewish. 

A: Yes. 

Q: But your mother™s also known as Jewish -- 

A: Yeah, but they knew -- these people knew -- th
e Gestapo knew she was not from th -- racially 
Jewish. 

Q: I see, so that she could be protected. 

A: And -- and -- yeah, and these 
people upstairs -- he was only a worker, but he was a very 
intelligent ma n, he was a communist and he -- 
he  knew what was going on. He was constantly 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
33 
 
 
listening to what they call the 
Fremdhörer, which was the fore
ign sender, which was England, 
you know. So they were very well informed. I we nt
 out the next day, and there was nothing left 
of my school, it was all burned down. And my 
parents told me that the Düsseldorf fi re 
departme nt was there in full force, and they 
were putting hoses on the adjacent buildings, to 
make sure that the adjacent buildings weren™t 
burning down, and they let the Jewish buildings 
burn to the ground. And these were enormous 
bui ldings, I mean, stone buildings, it was 
beautiful. 
Q: Did you now get frightened? 

A: No. 

Q: No. 

A: No. I re -- when I think of 
it, it™s just incr -- incredible. 
Q: It™s incredible, no? 

A: Yeah, it™s incre -- I just can™t believ
e that this ever happened some ti me s. 
Q: We re you known as a Misch
ling or not?  You were -- 
A: Not among -- not in school, and not -- no. I 
was a Mischling -- there were two kinds of 

Mischlingen. There were prefer -- pr eferential 
Mischlingen, those who were born to a Jewish 
parent, one Jewish parent, but raised either as a Pr
otestant or a Catholic. Th
ey were the privil -- 
preferred -- preferential. And then
 there were the Judischer Mischl
ingen, that™s was me . I mean, 
was far as the racial politics go, I was still a 
Mischling. But I was a Jew, and I was registered 
with my brother in the Jewish community, and I wa
s given the ri -- Jewish
 religion at birth, and 
so was my brother, so there was no ques
tion, and the Gestapo had all the papers.  
Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
34 
 
 
A: And the Previligierter  Mischlingen, they had 
a much easier life than the Jewish Mischlingen. 
They were able to go to -- to public school. I we --
 we weren™t. And they were not really terribly 

persecuted until -- and I don™t know this distinctly, 
but some where at the very beginning of ™45, 
when they rounded up Christian Mischlingen, you know
, the pref -- prefer -- pre -- preferential 
Mischlingen, and sent them to 
Terezín. Now wha t  I only learned not terribly long ago, which I 
didn™t know, because we were deported from Terezí
n at the end of ™44 -- I me an, October of ™44, 
is that they were building gas chambers and 
ovens in Terezín, that
 I didn™t know. And that 
supposedly, I mean this is what -- 
and I really want to research th
is, that the ovens were already 
finished, the only thing that was mi ssing were th
e doors. Now, whether they were going to shoot 
people, or put them -- o-or how they were going 
to kill them, but they had ovens. So, all these 
people, who felt relatively secure until 
™45, wouldn™t have been very secure.  
Q: When does Wa lter have to stop going to Du
isberg t -- for school?  Do you think it™s after 
Kristallnacht? 
A: I think so. 
Q: So it™s the -- 

A: I think it was after Kristallnacht, but 
I don™t reme mber how -- how long afterwards. 
Q: Right. 

A: I have a pretty darn good me mory, and asfar as my experiences go -- you know, I have a 

diary f -- which I should have brought, and I 
forgot that, from 1945. So I should have, you know 
-- 

Q: You wrote the diary in 1945? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Ah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
35 
 
 
A: Yeah. I wrote it on the road back, on paper. A
nd then I got to Lippborg and my a unt gave me  
the diary, and Buschi helped me  be -- re -- I put
 it in my diary. Yeah, 
but that I didn™t think 
about, yeah. 
Q: So, at some  point after Krista
llnacht, Wa lter is home with you? 
A: Right, and he has no schooling whatsoever -- 

Q: So do you -- 

A: -- except Uncle Karl, he got private less
ons, and the Schnooks, and 
I don™t know if they 

perished, I probably should look it up. They proba
bly perished. They were 
the last teachers, and 
they also gave private lessons
 to my brother, and to me. 
Q: And were they paid? 

A: My parents paid them, yes. 

Q: So your parents were st -- 

A: I mean, they didn™t pay my -- my  -- my uncle, but they -- 
Q: Right, right. 
A: -- they paid -- yeah. 

Q: So they™re working enough where there™s 
-- some how there™s enough to pay people, a 
mi ni ma l a mount, I suppose. 

A: Yeah, and also they ha d -- you know, they were constantly selling things. They still ha d a few 

paintings that they were selling, 
and my mother got rid of all he
r jewelry, she was selling things, 
you know, little by little. So th
at helped to a degree. 
Q: Right. Did you notice depression in
 your parents, or did they -- 
A: They didn™t try to show it ever. 

Q: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
36 
 
 
A: When we  were with them, and that lasted, 
believe it or not, all the way to Auschwitz. 
Q: Really? 
A: My father tried to -- to put 
-- to hide from us as much as 
he could. I didn™t realize it, I only 
realized it later, because my fath
er was transported out of Terezí
n about a year before we were 
all transported to Auschwitz. And he was worki
ng on the bunker that Hitler was -- they were 
building for Hitler in Berlin. And when he came 
back, he seemed to me  like a different  person. 
He wouldn™t talk about anything 
that happened to him working on 
this construction of the bunker 
in Berlin, but he -- he did tell me  he was wo
rking with other people fr
om concentration camps. 
And I think even though in Terezín most of 
us -- nobody knew that there was an Auschwitz, or 
there were extermination camps. I really -- later 
on am convinced that he got a full dose of what 
was going on from some  of the people who are work
ing with him in Berlin, and he never -- he 
never talked about his expe
rience in Berlin, never. 
Q: But you saw a change. 
A: I saw a change in him.  
Q: Right. 

A: Yeah.  

Q: So essentially the -- the good spirits, however
 you wish to describe it was a question of 
ignorance of -- in some  way, or ignoring evidence -- 

A: No, he was -- he was trying to -- to be so s
upportive and to give us so much hope. He wanted 
us to live, and he wanted to see my mother agai
n. And he did this even after he came  back from 
Berlin, but some how -- he was always a very 
open person, but whenever I asked about what 
happened, what was he doing in Berlin, he was 
like a closed book, he w
ould -- just would not 
open up. But no, he never -- I mean he -- 
he was encouraging us all the way. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
37 
 
 
Q: So that must have been important for you. 
A: It was very important for us, very important. A
nd that he also was able to give us a lot of 
food. You know, he -- he  -- he was a ma n who had 
held an enormous position at Karstadt™s. He 
was a terrific ma the matician. But he could do an
ything. He could work in construction. And in 
Terezín what he did when they as
ked him what his profession was, 
he didn™t say me rchant or -- 
or whatever, he said he was a 
carpenter. And he ended up with a 
carpentry job in Terezín in the 
bauhof, which gave him the chance to steal as mu
ch wood as he could, to give it to the cooks, 
and to get extra food for us. So you -- do you get a picture? 

Q: Yes, of what kind of a person -- 

A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: Do you reme mber the start of the war in 1939? 

A: Oh yes. 

Q: Is that big news, and -- 
A: Well, it was big news. I think my parents exp
ected it because Hitler was going into adjacent -- 
you know, he was taking over at first Austria and et
cetera. But we -- our last apartment was right 
by the railroad tracks, which used to be an
 -- was a house -- an apartment house owned by a 
Jewish family, and this wa s the last place we were 
allowed to live in, and it was not in the best 
area. Excuse me. And we could see the railroad
 tracks from our  apartment, and we saw the 
freight trains passing for hours and hours and ho
urs, loaded with equipment. Guns, and you 
know, war equipment. And my father and my mother
 were talking about it, 
and it was clear to us 
that Hitler was preparing for some thing, and thathe was going to take over another country. So 
my parents, yes, I mean, they tried to keep 
it from us, but I was too old by that time, and I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
38 
 
 
realized that war seemed immi nent. War seemed
 immi nent and still there was hope, but war and 
extermination of the Jews just -- that™s someth
ing that they never put two and two together.  
Q: So even all of these restrictions on the 
Jews, and the taking away of apartments -- 
A: Right. 

Q: -- and good jobs, etcetera -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- did not mean to you that so
me thing dire was going to happen. 

A: No, this guy eventually was goi
ng to -- I -- I thought we were 
going to be restricted in our 
apartment, which from where we came from 
was, you know, pretty going downhill. My parents 
had to work very hard. I was prep
ared that ma ybe they would put me  into a -- into labor for some  
war effort or some thing. But it never occurred 
to me  -- I mean, da -- can a healthy huma n mi nd 
picture what eventually happened?  You know -- 

Q: No, no and you -- 
A: No. 
Q: -- at -- in 1939 you™re
 only 13, you ma y be -- 
A: Right, right. 

Q: -- more adult than you were -- 

A: I was mu ch more concerned reading books by 
Karl May, which was an author who was very 

popular, who had never been to Ame r ica, and w
ho wrote all these stories about the fights 
between Indians and cowboys. A
nd I was reading these books, I 
mean, I didn™t read the books 
that little girls should read, I 
wrote these books, I -- it was -- I 
was insatiable. No -- and, you 
know, I™m -- I™m not sure whether -- what my par ent
s, if they really thought that things were 
going to -- to get so bad that our life were 
threatened, they certainly didn™t show it. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
39 
 
 
Q: They didn™t say. Now, do 
you start dating at this age? 
A: Yes. I™m trying to think. There were only a re
latively small number of people my age left in 
Düsseldorf. A lot of people had been able to get 
out of the country, and a lot of my friends had 
left, some  of them legally and some  illegally. Bu
t there were a bunch of people, some  of them I 
wasn™t clo -- close with, but at 
least a half a dozen or so that I became very close to. They were 
older than I was by a few years. They were deport
ed in 1941. I™m trying to
 think -- so I think I 
probably me t Kurt in 1939, or ™40. 
Q: This is Kurt Eckstein? 

A: Right. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: And he was learni ng to be an auto mechanic, b
ecause he fe lt, and hi s father felt -- his mother 
had died, that that would give him a better opport
unity to emigrate into 
another country. And we 
-- we had -- we danced, we had 
a Victrola, and i -- I didn™t know 
how to dance, they taught me  
how to dance. There were a couple of people, th
ey were half Jewish. Their father had been 
Christian and he had died, so they were left with
 their Jewish mother, a
nd a gra -- and a Jewish 
grandmother. And they were the most good l
ooking guys you had ever
 seen. Tall and blonde, 
and just terrific guys. And then there was a girl , and she was part of the group, and I didn™t care 

for her that much, I felt she was a loose girl. 
She let them touch her up and down and this is 
some thing that I just, you know, thought was really
 not right. And we ha
d a very good time. And 
then in ™41, when the first trans
ports were leaving Düsseldorf, they
 all we nt into that transport. 
Q: The two boys and the girl? 

A: And the girl. 

Q: But not you. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
40 
 
 
A: No, and Kurt. 
Q: And Kurt. 

A: And Kurt. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And I gave a pledge to them that I would vi
sit their grandmother. Their mother was deported 
too, but their grandmother wasn™t. So their gran
dmother was the only one left, and she was very 
old lady, she was kind of bent, and 
-- and inconsolable that -- a
nd I went there a lot, and I don™t 
know what -- where she ended up, I can™t reme mber
. She probably was deported to Te rezín, and 

then, you know, Terezín was a transit camp. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: And they went to Minsk, that I know, that they went to Minsk. And in Minsk we now -- I just 

read an article about it not t
oo long ago, they were all shot. 
So that was Kurt Eckstein. 
Q: But Kurt was 18 [indecipherable] 
A: Yeah, he was -- he -- 
Q: -- and you were 13. 

A: No, I was a bit older than that, I was bor
n in ™26, and Kurt -- how old was I in -- 
Q: We ll, ™39 you™re 13. So when do you m
eet him?  Somewhere 
™39 - ™40, right? 
A: Yeah, I think -- 

Q: So you™re 13 - 14? 

A: -- ™40 -- probably ™40, yeah. 

Q: ™40, okay, so you™re 14. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Still not a grown woma n. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
41 
 
 
A: But I was very ma ture for my age -- 
Q: Yeah, I was going to ask -- 

A: -- and I tell you where I met him. I met hi m at
 my Uncle Karl™s house, who was my  Spanish 
and English teacher, because Kurt wa s taki ng less
ons from Uncle Karl, too. And Uncle Karl was 

vouching for Kurt, and rightly so, and he -- I re
member, I me an my parents must -- now in 
retrospect that you ask me  that, 
they must have had some  que sti
ons about it. I reme mb er Uncle 
Karl told my  parents that he was the most w
onderful kid, and he trusted him i mplicitly. And he 
had good reason to, yes. 

Q: So your parents were worried that he mi ght 
try to take advantage of you in some  way? 
A: Yeah, because my parents knew from me , wh
at was going on with Ruth and the other -- you 
know, the other two guys.  

Q: Right, right. 

A: But Ruth was older, and -- and I™m sure they 
-- they were sexually active. We ll, I™m glad they 
were, you know, because they -- 

Q: Considering what happened, yeah. 

A: -- had -- they had, you know, they had a very short life left. 

Q: Right. 

A: And they seemed to -- you know, it™s very easy
 to stereotype some body, she was a loose girl 
and all this kind of stuff. She was -- 

Q: Well, especially when you™re th
at age, it™s very easy, right? 
A: Right. And she was a very beautiful girl -- 

Q: Yes. 

A: -- I reme mber, I was very jealous, she was very sexy looking. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
42 
 
 
Q: Yes? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Did you get your period? 

A: Yeah, I -- I™m sure, yeah, I think I got
 it probably by the time I was 13, yeah. Yeah, I 

reme mber, yeah I did, yeah. But I was very, you know, 
I was very innocent. I didn™t -- I wasn™t -- 

you know, my mo -- my parents told
 me -- I knew where babies came from and all this, but I 
don™t think I thought about it very much. It neve
r -- there were certain things you did and you 
didn™t do. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: And -- and I think th -- I think my parents we
re pretty open, but not like they are today, you 
know, I™m -- 

Q: Wa s it important for you to me nstruate?  Wa s 
th -- was that a big deal [indecipherable] 
A: I think I was frightened to
 death. I thought I was getting 
-- you know, I think I menstruated 
pretty early, but I don™t reme mber
 exactly, but I -- I know I went
 to my mother and there was 
some thing terribly wrong with me . So then I 
got a talk what this was all about, you know. 

Q: Because you hadn™t know this before. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Right. Well. 

Q: Now, we re you Bat-mitzvah™d? 

A: No, that was not -- 

Q: That was never done. 

A: -- that was never heard of in -- in Europe. 
That is a -- that™s an
 American invention. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
43 
 
 
Q: Okay. 
A: It is. 

Q: Right, right. So do things get even
 worse, ™39 and ™40, as the war -- 
A: They -- they™re ge tting worse beca use we -- we  
can™t sit on benches any more because it says 
Jews can™t sit here. We can™t swim in the Rhine 
river any more because it says Jews can™t swim 

here any more. And -- and we can™t go to the m
ovies. I reme mber when I was in school, and we 
used to walk -- from school we used to walk
 home, and we passed by a movie house, and there 
was a picture of a mouse playing the piano. We  c a
lled it the American mouse, and we wanted so 
badly to see that picture, that 
Mickey Mouse picture, but there 
-- you couldn™t get in. There was a 
sign, Jews cannot enter. And Konigs Allee in Dü
sseldorf was like Fifth Avenue. And pretty soon 
there were signs all over, Jews can™t in -- enter, 
Jews can™t be serviced he -- served here any 
more, etcetera. Those were the stores that used 
to have, we speak English, parler Francais and all 
this as a -- for an international city. But on t
op of that we speak English and -- and parler 
Francais, no was, Jews can™t enter. 

Q: So these kinds of 
signs proliferate -- 

A: All over. 

Q: -- all over th -- the -- is 
it after the wa -- after 1939, between
 ™39 and ™41, it -- it gets 
considerably worse -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- or it™s progressive
 from ™33, do you think? 
A: No, no, no. 

Q: No. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
44 
 
 
A: Not from ™33, but it was -- it
 was gradual even from ™33, you c
ouldn™t go to school, to a -- you 
couldn™t -- you -- do ma ny things, 
but the -- these drastic st eps 
were coming in very short 
intervals, starting really, 
I would say, from ™38 on. 
Q: Mm-hm. Right. 
A: And then progressively worse and worse. 

Q: And in ™41 you have to wear the star? 

A: Yeah, and then we had to also have
 a new mi ddle initial. Sa rah and Israel. 
Q: Israel for boys, and -- 

A: Right. 

Q: -- or men. 

A: And then our stamps, our food stamps had J
ude, Jew, stamped all through the food stamps, 
and if I went to a butcher s
hop with my food stamps -- I did 
all the shopping for the family 
because my mother worked. And if the butcher di dn™t want  to wait on us, he had a perfect right 
to do so, because we had Jewish food stamps. Or he
 -- they could turn us 
back not to come  into 
their establishment when we -- when we had to w
ear the Jewish star. And 
then they -- the Nazi 
youth would beat us up. 

Q: We re you beaten? 

A: Oh yes. I was scared to go out. And then th
ey took my bicycle away, which was my for m of 
transportation. You know, it was all 
gradually. Then they took all the jewe lry away. And the only 
reason why I have things is because of my aunts.
 Because, don™t forget, I wouldn™t have a si -- I 
wouldn™t have the -- a -- anythi
ng, I wouldn™t even have some 
of the documents I™m going to 
give to you if it weren™t for my aunts, becau
se my mother couldn™t keep them either. 
Q: Right, right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488

A: Even the police -- the police Aufenthaltsbes
cheingung, where you have to
 -- to inform the m 
that you™re leaving, I ha
ve that, I™m going to -- 
End of Tape Three 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
46 
 
 
Beginning Ta pe Four 
Q: Ursula, we™re in sort of ™39 - ™40 
- ™41, we™re in that period of time -- 
A: Okay, mm-hm. 
Q: -- when things are progressively getting muc h worse -- 

A: Right. 

Q: -- for you. 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: And I think when we ended the last tape
, you were talking about 
even your bicycle was 
confiscated -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- so your mode of transportation is lost. 

A: Exactly. 

Q: I wanted to know if you had bad dreams that you reme mb er? 
A: I don™t recall that. 
Q: You don™t recall any bad dreams? 

A: No, no. 

Q: Cause I was just wondering if your
 anxiety was comi ng out some where. 
A: I think -- it depends on the 
person, I think I™m -- it™s very
 di fficult to analyze yourself. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: But I think when there is tremendous pressure
, I get -- become  very strong. And I think that 
was actually true when I was a young teenager, and 
I think that I would never be -- have the 
tendency to kind of self-indulge 
and feel sorry for myself. It 
was always the idea of keep on 
going and survive. And I think 
that -- I™m -- don™t know where 
it came from, it comes from my 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
47 
 
 
parents too, and I think it helped 
me  a lot. It helped me  in Au
schwitz. I mean, if you ask me  the 
same  question about Auschwitz, I can only tell y
ou that I wrapped myself
 into a cocoon and I 
was living inwards. And some how, it sounds strangeor unbelievable to a lot of people, but it™s 
the truth. What happened outside of me , even wh
en that woman was shot in front of me, it 
some how didn™t totally touch me  inside. You 
know, I was able to do that, and I didn™t do it 

consciously, it came just naturally. 
The defenses kind of helped me . 
Q: Right. But up until the deportation, you had your
 entire fa mily, who was al -- who couldn™t 
protect you from everything. 

A: Right. 

Q: But there was a kind of -- 

A: Right, right. 

Q: -- buffer for you, right? 

A: There was, and -- certainly, and I think what
 helps people young and old is when they are 
very, very busy and focused. And I was very bus
y. I was studying English and Spanish, I was 
getting some education by hook or by crook, which th
e Nazis didn™t want us to have, and I was 
keeping house, and I was cooking. And my father
 worked from dawn till dusk in construction, 
and my mother worked very hard in the factory, 
in the belt factory. So I didn™t have that much 
time, and somehow I was able, the little time wh
e n I had some was at night, and I wasn™t 
supposed to read in be d until 12, one or two o™cloc
k at night, but I did that, and I always had a 
flashlight, I actually, you know, 
read by flashlight. So -- 
Q: Did you read under th
e covers, or over? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
48 
 
 
A: Yes, when they -- well, I listened if so
me body was comi ng, because they knew that I was 
reading, and I was reprim -- reprima nded ma ny, ma ny 
ti mes, but those were the only times that I 

really could read. I was ve
ry busy, you know, taking -- 
Q: What were you reading? 

A: Oh, junk. 

Q: Was that the only thing that was availabl e? 

A: No, but it appealed to me , th
ese -- these western stories. I must
 have read every one of these 
Karl May books, which -- 

Q: They were really popular, weren™t they? 

A: They were really popular, and they were 
really boys™ books. And there were some  girls™ 

books that we re very popular, but I didn™t go fo
r those. I went for the Karl May books, and I 
didn™t go for the nice girl books, and the roma nce 
stuff, but for the Indians and the wars, and I 
don™t know. A psychologist has to decide what™s in it. 
Q: And whe r e did you get the books from?  
A: I got them in school when I 
was still going to my school, and th
en my  father got some  for me  
because I was so interested in -- in them. 
And I don™t really reme mb
er, maybe my aunts. 
Q: Tell me , did your father burn all 
of his books, or a selected group? 
A: No, just the books that he 
knew were on the forbidden list. 
Q: I see. 

A: But don™t forget, my father had a tremendous libra
ry when we were in -- in Aplerbeck, in that 
suburb there of Dort mund. And then, by the time  th
ey moved to Düsseldorf, they had to get into 
a much smal ler apartment, and they had lost a lot,
 and he had sold a lot of things. What he did 
with some  of the books that he did not take to 
Düsseldorf, whether he gave them awa y, or sold 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
49 
 
 
them -- I know they tried to sell
 a lot of things, I really don™t 
know. But certainly that whole set 
of furniture, that was sold, I 
know that, in -- in his study. It was beautiful furniture with a 
bookcase that covered almost the 
whole wall, and leather chair a
nd -- and a -- and a big desk, 
because I know that so well, I™m not -- wasn™t su
pposed to go into my father™s study, but I often 
did, when I know nobody was around, and I was ru
mmaging around, and I did read some  books 
that were kind of forbidden books for me , whic h were in his library and had a lot of sex in it. I 

don™t think I understood a lot of it, but I read 
it. My parents didn™t 
know that I read it. 
Q: Tell me  about your brother during this pe
riod. Now, he™s not goi
ng to school, but he™s 
significantly younger. 

A: We ll, he went to school longer than I 
did, because when our school was burned down, d -- 
Duisberg was the only -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- Jewish school that was stil
l in existence, and so he trav
eled by train with a permit to 
Duisberg, and that was before we had to wearthe star. And he -- wa 
-- he -- he got some  
additional tutoring from my Uncle Karl, and my fa
ther di d a lot of tutori ng in math, which was 
his strength, I mean, he was a ma n who -- who coul
d give you fractions a
nd anything by ha -- in 
his head. He didn™t even have to use a pen a
nd a -- a pencil and pape
r. So he did get s -- 
instruction. He also had a very 
beautiful voice, and he -- and he 
loved to sing. So wi -- you know, 
we made the most of
 what we could.  
Q: Did he help you with the housework, was he in the house a lot? 

A: No, not particular. I mean, I think he was wi
lling probably, if I aske
d him something, but in 
Germany that was really a girl™s work and a wo
man™s work. Not -- my father would do anything, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
50 
 
 
but I™m -- I don™t particularly recall that I asked 
him to do much in the house. I probably asked 
him to go and -- and buy certain thin
gs, or go to the store, but -- 
Q: But was that also difficult because there we
re certain hours only when you could go to the 
store, or you could be refused easily? 
A: We ll, we could be refused, but 
it was worse after we wore the star. See, before we wore the 
star, people didn™t yi -- know 
you we re Jewish. In Düsseldorf so
me  of the people did know, who 
know the Lennebergs, which was a family who ha
d lived in Düsseldorf for a long, long time. I 
mean, they™re a very established family. But I 
recall mostly being beaten up and being refused 
when we first had these food stamps which hadprinted Jude all through 
them. And when we -- 
certainly after we had to wear the st ar . 

Q: And who beat you up? 

A: We ll, bunch of kids who ca me  out of school, 
and ma ny of them in un
iform. The Hitler youth 
and the BDM, I mean they were uniforme
d, and you know some people have made the 
connection, oh they are like -- they
 we re like the boy scouts, and th
e girl scouts, well they were 
not. They were indoctrinated. They had leader
s who actually told their -- the young people under 

them that it was their duty as good Germans -- 
and I™m talking now about Germans, not about 
Jews, to listen to thei r fathers,
 and -- to their father and mother
 and grandparents and family, and 
if they heard anything in the hous
e, that anybody in their fami l y said some thing derogatory about 
the Führer, it was their duty to tell him. This
 was the -- the leader, th
e boy scout le -- the youth 
leader. And there were ma ny peopl e who found them
selves in trouble because their own children 
denounced them. And these were the kids who were ma
de to feel like heroes if they di -- did that. 
And their leaders were usually young guys in th
eir late teens, who were good scouts, very good 
hikers, you know, like -- like the boy scouts. 
And -- some body they could look up to. They 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
51 
 
 
wanted to be as good as climbing mo untains and 
-- and swimmi ng and all this kind of thing. And 
they were much more i mpressionable when th
ese young people talked to them, and told them 
was to do, than their parents, which is a norma l 
thing even in a norma l society. And that™s what 
happened. And then if -- especially
 after we wore the star, ther
e were bunch of kids, they had 
these meetings almost on a nightly basis, wher
e they were indoctri nated, they sang the Hitler 
songs. And they came out of these meetings, and if
 they saw a Jew, they would beat him up. And 
it™s mu -- it™s much easier for 10 kids to do it th
an for one. One would start, oh, there™s a Jew, 
come  on. And then they would st
art saying, Jude ist signate spit
ze augen ecke, arschloch dreckig, 
which is -- it™s very vulgar, you know, I translated
 it in my book, but the Jew with the -- with the 
pointy nose, and a dirty asshole, and you know, th
ings like that. And that™s what we were 
subjected to every day when we we
re out. I hated to go out any more. 
Q: Did you fight back when they beat you? 

A: Oh, no, I mean -- 
Q: No. 
A: -- if you fought back -- 

Q: It was worse. 

A: -- and I was -- that™s one thing my parents told
 me , never to fight with BDM, which were the 
girls, or  the Hitler youth, because if you 
were one person they would gang up on you, and 
certainly the police would come , and y -- I would 
have put my  parents into harm™s way, too. 
Who told you to do that? Did your pa
rents indoctrinate you to do that? 
Q: So were you hurt? 

A: No, I was never hurt. I was pushed against th
e wall a coup -- people were
 hurt, I knew people 
who were hurt, but I was never hurt. And my 
parents asked me couldn™t I do my shopping and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
52 
 
 
stuff at a certain time, and don™t go out in the la
te afternoon, and then pret
ty soon it was resolved, 
we weren™t allowed to go out at dusk any more anyway. So -- 
Q: So in July of 1942, you get a notice to go to Te rezín. 

A: Yeah, I was the f -- 

Q: And on -- and only you. 

A: Only I, I was the first one to get that noti
ce. And my parents -- which again, you know, I was 
a young girl, I didn™t quite a -- quite appreciate wh
at my parents must have gone through. And I 
reme mber their discussions, what are they going 
to do. They would refer to me  as a child, even 
though, you know, by -- by that time, in f -- in ™42 -- 

Q: You™re 16. 

A: I was 16. They can™t let their child go alone. A
nd then they also, rightly so felt, well now, 
she™s going to go now to a labor camp. Nobody kne
w about concentration camps. Ext e rmination 
camps, nobody had -- could even imagine. Excuse 
me . Now t hen, she™s going to go to one labor 
camp, and then maybe next month Bübchen, my br
other would be sent to
 another labor camp, 
and my father -- we would all be separated. So 
I know they went through a terrible time , trying 
to figure out what to do. The conclusion they made was wrong, they should have let me  go alone, 

but they didn™t, and they a
ll volunteered to go with me . 
Q: Including your mother? 

A: Including my mother. And I had -- believe I 
had me ntioned before that Puetz, who was the 
head of the Gestapo, hated my mother. And I™m su
re it was just to hurt her, certainly no -- he 
knew where we were going, but certainly not out of
 compassion that he wa sn™t going to let her 
go with us. And he probably felt because I say this
 since he pursued my mother at the factory 
where she was working, at the Schreyeck™s, almo st on 
a weekly basis, he proba
bly felt that if he 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
53 
 
 
couldn™t have her, if -- he was going to trap he
r, and she was going to -- to get to what the 
Germans used to call numero sicher, number 
secure, which was a camouflage word for sending 
people to prison. So then he said she couldn™t 
go with us, and she appealed, and no way was he 
going to allow her to go with us. So my brother a
nd my father and I, we were deported. And in 
Düsseldorf they had a wonderful place to 
deport Jews from, which was a Düsseldorf 

slaughterhouse, the Schlachthof. The reason wa
s probably partially vi
cious and partially 
convenience, because the Schlachthof had a lot of tr
ain rails, so they coul d divert trains to the 
Schlachthof without having a sp
ectacle at the ma in train 
station deporting the Jews.  
Q: Do you think this guy Puetz wanted to
 have a relationship with your mother? 
A: Oh, I™m s ure of it. 

Q: You™re sure of that. 

A: I™m sure of it not just from 
my mother, but I™m sure of it from 
things my father said, and what 
the Schreyecks have said. Because even under th
e circumstances my mother was racially not a 
Jew. And this was a racial thing, and after he had ma de sure she couldn™t go with us to the camp, 

he still pursued her, you know
, which was some what unusual. 
Q: Right. At the time  -- w-were you included in 
the conversation about what to do, whether they 
all should go, or you should go alone? 

A: Not directly. 

Q: Not directly. 

A: No. I was included, of course, when we ha
d to ma ke a si milar decision in Terezín. 
Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
54 
 
 
A: But at that time  it was mostly my  parents. An
d I know that they didn™t get any sleep, that they 
were constantly throwing it back and forth. And 
I would have to ma ke it up, and I don™t do that. I 
try to be as truthful to my me mory as I can. 
Q: Right. 

A: Whether I said some thing, I can go alone, which 
is probably -- it™s mo st 
likely I said
 it, but I 
can™t reme mber that. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: So I don™t want to say that. 

Q: Do you have any recollection 
of feeling relieved that you we
ren™t going alone?  Do you have 
any recollection of what it felt 
like once the decision was ma de? 
A: I don™t think -- 

Q: Cause you ma y not. 

A: -- I don™t think I remember 
having that kind of reaction. 
Q: Uh-huh, right. 

A: I think it was a terrible trauma  for me , formy father, which I sensed. I mean, even though he 

tried to have a stiff upper lip, but 
that he wasn™t able to do any 
more. I was getting older, and I 
knew my fat her. And this separati
on from my mother was very, ve
ry difficult for him. And times 
were so uncertain. But y
eah, I can™t really -- 
Q: So are you folks hearing any rumo rs in 1942 about what happened when the Nazis go into 

R u s s i a?  Wh e n  Wo r l d  Wa r  
11
 fully starts in 1941?  
You don™t hear anything? 
A: No, we only hear what the Nazis told us in
 their propaganda. We  h
eard through my father™s 
communist friend in the same  building, and when 
my father listened to also, which was British 
news, what was happening in the world, in the wa r. And it didn™t sound very good at that time , as 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
55 
 
 
you know. But nobody that I know of ever ma de any 
-- gave any explanation to what happened 
in the camps . And as you know, that even when 
people ma naged to escape some  of the camps, 
and try to bring it to the atte
ntion of the American governme nt, which I didn™t know, we -- we 
only learned that, you know, after the war, 
nobody wanted to listen, nobody wanted to -- to 
believe it. And what I have to say to you is 
had I not been in Auschwitz, had I not been a 
witness, had not -- had I not seen what I have se
en, I™m not sure I could believe it. A teacher at 
one of the high schools was very 
upset with two students. It™s 
a very large high school in a 
working class area in -- in New Jersey, and in 
New Jersey it™s compulsory to teach about the 
Holocaust. And these kids, at least one of them c l aime d, and ma ybe the other one agreed then, 

that this was all ma de up, this never happened, a
nd when she said, ﬁWell, we™re going to have a 
speaker who was there,ﬂ they ma de fun of that. 
So when I came  to this high school with ha -- 
which has two and a half thousand students, I was to
ld that these two guys will be put right in the 
front in the auditorium. And their attitude was 
such I knew this meant trouble. So I made eye 
contact with them, and I said, ﬁI
 understand that there ar e some 
people here who believe and are 
convinced that this never happened.ﬂ And they 
were, you know, they were perking up. And then 

I said, ﬁWell, I can understand it. If I hadn™t been
 there, I wouldn™t believe
 it either.ﬂ And from 
then on, I had no more problem with them. 

Q: Intere sting. 

A: You know, it disarmed them. But I didn™t say th
is t -- just to calm th
em down, I really me an 
that. This is totally, to
tally incomprehensible to any norma l human being, what I saw. Totally. 
And so I -- I -- I really 
think it™s beyond a civili
zed person™s comprehension. 
Q: Well let me ask you, you must have met people 
-- this is going beyond where we are in the 
time, but you must have me t people who went
 through some thing of what you went through. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
56 
 
 
A: Mm-h m.  
Q: Perhaps were even in the camps longer than you were. 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: Who did realize what was happening befo
re they saw it. Do you -- do you have an 
understanding of how s o me  people 
can imagine this happening?  There we re people who left 
Germany. 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: This -- this guy who said, you know, I forget 
who it was, who left and said the -- you know, 
soon you™re not going to be able to ri
de the buses, and everybody was laughing. 
A: Yes. 

Q: So he seemed to be able to
 imagine at least so me stuff. 
A: Yeah, but he was one in a million. 

Q: Uh-huh. 
A: I mean, don™t get my statistics -- 
Q: Yeah, yeah, right. 

A: -- I didn™t mean this -- 

Q: It doesn™t ma -- 

A: -- you know. I think ho -- Mr. Rosenstein was very
 different from the ma jority of Jews. I can™t 
talk about the eastern Jews. They -- except I have
 friends, and I ma de friends in the displaced 
person camp, and I made fr iends in the camps, who came fr om cultured eastern Jewish families. 

I™m not talking about that. I mean the shtetl Jews. 
They were different from a lot of us, and they 
were much more in their own circle, and I don™
t know how they reacted. 
I -- I have -- I have no 
clue. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
57 
 
 
Q: Right, right. 
A: Some  of them had been subjected to persecution 
in Poland and in Russia in the --  in the shtetl, 
but I just could never have imagined what ha
ppened. And I think these unconscious decisions, 
believe  me , there were ma ny peopl e who fell to pieces. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: People who ran to the wire 
to electrocut e themselves. The 
only time Buschi and I and Zdena 
were thinking about that, when we were going to
 be transported back to Auschwitz, because we 
knew what was awaiting us. But the instincts to 
live are very, very strong, and are st ronger in 
some  people than in others. The strength physical
ly of some  people, can not be measured in 
height or weight. It is some th
ing else. I think that supports m
eans a great deal. Now ma ybe if I 
would have been all alone some place in an extermination camp, without anybody to support me , 

but I with all the mi zaira, I had the luck to be with these five
 wome n, and the way we supported 
each other really he lped us, and helped us to, as
 I like to put it, put our
selves into a cocoon and 
not to even be aware of what was happening outside
 of us. So we all need some  support, and it 
can™t --it cannot all come  from the insi de, 
but a lot of it does come  from the inside. 
Q: But tell me , do you r e me mber what it was 
like in the slaughterhouse as you were waiting?  
Had you -- 

A: It wasn™t -- it was confusi
on, and we didn™t know -- we knew we
 were going to a -- in cold -- 
in quote, labor camp called Theresienstadt. We ll, 
I had no clue what Theresienstadt wa s, we 
knew -- we knew that. We were told that the tr
ansport would go to Theresienstadt, and we knew 
it was in what was then Czechos
lovakia, and we had our -- 

Q: Is that what the notice said to you, or
 did the notice just 
order a deportation? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
58 
 
 
A: The notice just ordered us whether the -- 
the Jewish Judische Ge me inde is a Jewish 
organization in Düsseldorf, whether they were to
ld that it woul d go to 
Theresienstadt, but I, 
myself didn™t reme mber that particularly, how 
we found out, but the -- th
e piece of paper I™m 
going to give to you, in my fathe
r™s handwriting, at th
e police station in Düsseldorf, where he 
had to notify them that he was leaving Düsse
ldorf, in that it says Theresienstadt. 
Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh. 
A: So -- you see?  So I know that somehow 
we knew we were -- I knew we were -- knew we 
were going to Theresienstadt, but how we were infor med of t hat, I cannot rec -- recall. 

Q: So even though he was being deported, he ha
s to go to the police station and tell them?  
A: Yeah, I gave it -- I have that 
piece of paper for you. I have that. 
Q: Quite amazing, isn™t it? 

A: It™s an apme ldunk for  my brother, and with 
our name s, Ursula Sarah, 
Otto Israel, and Wa lter 
Israel. So that -- that piece of paper is in ther
e. I don™t think I™ve give
n you these papers yet. 
Yeah. 

Q: Quite amazing. Okay, we™re going to ha
ve to stop the tape now and change. 
A: Okay. 
End of Tape Four 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
59 
 
 
Beginning Ta pe Five 
Q: What was it like in that 
slaughterhouse?  We re there just 
hundreds of thousands of people -- 
A: We ll, is -- that was like bedlam, and don™t forget, by that time , in ™42, a number of transports 
had already left Düsseldorf at th
e end of ™41, and at the very be
ginning of ™42, and -- which were 
not going to Terezín, but ma ny of
 them had gone to Poland. And 
a lot of the people in our 
transport were quite old, and not in good physical
 condition. And I reme mber there were tables 
which were ma nned by Gestapo se
cret police, and there was one table which was ma nned by a 
representative of -- from the Jewish community, wh
ich had the list of name s of all the Jews in 
Düsseldorf, who belonged -- who -- o-of Jewish fa
ith, and the Jewish community had this list. 
And they were checked off, you know the Germans 
were very good at ch -- at anything that was 
lists or bureaucracy. And so we were checked of
f by the Jewish -- a repr esentative of the Jewish 
community, and we were checked off by the SS, to be sure that everybody who had gotten -- 

gotten the notification to present themselves ha
d appeared. And then we had to go to another 
person, a -- a Nazi at a -- at 
a table where the name , like Ursula
 Pawel was twice now -- Jewish 
community the -- the SS, and then the secret poli
ce, a third one, were given a sign, which were 
put on around our neck, which I don™t recall whether 
it had a number, that I can™t recall, but it 
had my na me on it. 
Q: On the front? 

A: Yes. Everybody on -- in the transport was 
given a sign. It wasn™t huge, you know, it was a 
sign that -- with a string around the neck. 

Q: And was this -- do you re
me mber if it was handwritten? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
60 
 
 
A: I think it was. It mi ght not have been al
l of it, but certainly 
the number, I think, was 
handwritten, and if I recall it correctly, it was wr
itten with pretty heavy black ink, or you know, 
pen or whatever. 
Q: And you were supposed to wear this on 
the train -- wear this [indecipherable] 
A: Oh yes, we had to wear this on the train, an
d then we were told to put our suitcases at a 
certain place and not to touch them, they were goi
ng to take care of the suitcases. Of course, we 
never saw the suitcases again. These were the su
itcases that had been packed for -- from 1938 
on, to go to this country. And if it hadn™t been fo
r the American consul, we would have been in 
this country. And those suitcases, we neve
r saw again. N-Nobody on the transport. The only 
thing that we  were allowed to keep wa s some  ha
nd luggage, which was made out of like -- like a 
small rucksack material, which I remember I 
had, it was one of those, like when you go on a 
hiking trip, and it was a bag like 
that. Now, that™s all I had. 
Q: And wha t  -- do you reme mber what was in it? 
A: I can™t recall exactly. Proba
bly some  food or some thing, bu
t n-nothing that I reme m -- no 
clothing, nothing.  
Q: And this was the summer. So 
what were you we -- were you -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- you had nothing for cold weather, obviously. 

A: No. 

Q: And was it very hot? 

A: It was extremely hot, and we -- we -- when 
we arrived by train in Baushowiczy, which was 
Bauschowitz, because there was no trai n station, 
no rails to Terezí n, they were only built later for 
the sole purpose of transporting Jews from Terezí
n to the east. But we arrived in Bauschowitz, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
61 
 
 
and there were trucks there with Czechs who had 
been in Terezín since ™41, and some  of them 
had striped uniforms on, which al
so was not continued, you know, after more and more transport 
arrived, they did not give uniforms to inma tes a
ny more. And they had to -- they worked for the 
Nazis to -- to take all the lugga
ge out of the luggagecars, and put them on trucks. And of course, 
they were then transported back to Ge rmany. We
 were given some  clothing later on in Terezín, 
which -- what transport they came fr om I don™t k
now, but they were pretty bad clothing. But as 
far -- y -- one thing I do reme mber, that my mother
 insi sted that we wear our coats. Now why she 
insisted that, I don™t know, but it was some thing we 
did not put in our luggage. We  either had it 
on our arm, and so we did have our coats.  
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And these coats, I reme mber these coats, 
and my mother remi nded me many ti me s, because 
she had a German tailor who was an
 anti-Nazi and was very good to 
-- to her, and he -- she got 
some material and he made these coats for us. So 
they were supposed to also take us to America. 
So my brother -- and I reme mber the coat too, because I blame d the coat very much on the fact 

that my -- my brother was select
ed immediately to be -- to be 
killed. You know, he was 13 years 
old, and he was of average height for his age. 
He had a very young face, and he had this coat, 

which he had outgrown. And a boy with a coat, with
 a gray coat -- and 
you know with a -- half 
the arms are -- are showing, it ma kes a young 
child even look younger. So, you know, you can 
argue. I went  through this in my mi nd, you know, how
 big was he, because there were some  kids 
they were 14, by some  - -  some how t hey ma nage d 
to survive, but my brother didn™t. He looked 
like a -- a young kid.  

Q: When you got on the train to go to Terezín, wh
at sort of a train was it? Wa s it a passenger 
trai n, was it a -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
62 
 
 
A: They had some  passenger cars, and they had 
some  cattle cars, and we were in the passenger 
car. And I am not sure that it -- there was any si
gnificance to that, whether this was calculated or  
not. And I reme mber the two people who were on 
the train with us, and in the same -- on the 
same  bench, or whatever you want to call it, a
nd one was a nurse, Bella,
 and one was a woma n 
my father knew, he -- she was a radiologist in 
Boston. And they were in the same  compartment. 
There were other people in -- 
Q: A radiologist in Bost on? You just  said -- 

A: In -- in Düsseldorf. 

Q: Ah, sorry. 

A: Yeah, I™m sorry. 

Q: It™s okay. 

A: I didn™t mean that. Sorry about that. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: I think my association with saying Boston is because as you know, I went into x-ray, and I 
was in touch with a lot of radiologists in Bo
ston. No, she was from Düsseldorf, and she was on 
the transport, and I don™t know what happened to 
them. I me a n, I know they got to Terezín, but I 
don™t know what happened to them, and I couldn™t-- I couldn™t reme mber  the physician™s last 

name, I only reme mber Bella. I was very impre
ssed with them, because there was a lot of 
me dical language going back and forth between 
Bella, who was a nurse, and this physician. And 
I thought that would be really
 neat for me  to be in me dicine. That I reme mber. 

Q: Was that a terr ible trip? 

A: I don™t recall that it was terrib
le for me . I think it was terrible
 for older people, and some  of 
them were in cattle cars. We  were in a passenge
r car. I think that we 
had some  food that my 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
63 
 
 
mother had prepared for us in our sidebags, 
and some how between the conversation we had, and 
my father had a -- some -- there was so me me
n he was friendly with, and they had lively 
conversations. We  weren™t depressed. I think he  was more than we were because of the 
separation from my mother, but I™
m not sure that I understood, 
or that anybody understood what 
we were facing, because we were going to go to
 this wonderful labor camp, and then some body 
spread the word this was a privileged camp for 
German Jews. And when we came to Terezín, the 
first thing that was very diffi
cult for me  was the language. The 
Czech prisoners descended on the 
train, and this was a language I™d never heard in 
my life, and I couldn™t make out what they were 
saying. And most Czechs speak German, especially
 educated Czechs. Of 
course, we all hated 
anything German. And e ven though we were Jews
 in Terezín, do you think the Czechs would 

have spoken one word -- the ch -- Czech Jews w
ould have spoken one word of Ger man with us?  
I mean, I was completely lost. And I tried to -- to
 get some help from some  Czech inma tes. As 
soon as they heard German, that
 was like raising the red flag, 
you know. So we had to -- we had 
to really battle on more than one front. And the 
Czechs had come  to Terezín, they were the first 
people to come  to Terezín. So a
ll the good quarters were occupied by Czechs. The jobs that were 
really good, like in the kitchen were by the ch --
 the Czechs already held those. And I was just 
very lucky. A lot of people weren™t as lucky as
 I was. I immediately 
volunteered to work. And 
they asked me  if I had a ny expe
rience working with children. Th
ey first send me  to the bauhof, 
which was my father worked, to carry wood and st
uff. But then I had told them that I was good 
with children, and what ma de me  do that, I ha
ve no clue. And then I got in t -- was told to 
present myself, that they were going to send me
 to work in the youth 
home -- the youth barrack, 
L410 it was first, and then it was 414. And it was -- 
the youth barrack was ju
st starting, it was at 
the very beginning. We  -- we didn™t really have -- 
there were some pr -- rooms didn™t even have 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
64 
 
 
beds, so we got thre -- three tier bunkbeds, and 
my father did a lot of work to ma ke it more 
livable for us.  
Q: So, are you taking care o -- didn™t at some  point
 you also take care of teenage kids, or did you 
go imme diately to the orphans? 

A: Yeah, my first job in the yout
h home  was really -- not to ha
ve my -- the sole responsibility, 
but I was working with Hilde Dublon, who was at
 least four years older than I was, she came 
from Ha mburg. And she was what was called the 
head betreuer, you know, the chief betreuer, 
chief caretaker of the 30 children in our room. 
They were -- some  were between 14 and 16 years 
old in the first room. 

Q: So they™re not much younger than you? 

A: No, no, but somehow I -- I got th
at. I was quite ma ture in my ways. And Hilde and I hit it off 
beautifully. There was never any 
tension, or any rivalry, and I l
oved her. She was a beautiful 
woman, very intelligent woman. And then we ha
d a fe w terrible situations health-wise in 
Terezín. We  had a lot of lice, and particularly
 Kleider Lause, which are the lice that cause 

typhoid -- typhus. The bad stuff, not the paratyphoid, 
but the bad stuff. And th
ey lay their eggs in 
the seams of clothing, and they transmit that dise
ase. And there was an epidemic that broke out, 
which nobody realized was typhus, and some  of the 
kids in our room got 
sick. And then there 
were kids in other rooms that got sick, and th
ey had -- we didn™t know what the symp toms were, 
and we had some  very good Czech doctors, but they had no me dicines, and they had no way of 

combating these illnesses. And then we lost a 
couple of kids, and then Hilde got sick. And we 

didn™t associate it w-with the ot
her deaths, we didn™t know what it was. And she told me  she 
couldn™t eat. Now for anybody not to be hungry in Ter
ezín, you really had to 
be sick. So, she had 
her rations on the plate, and she couldn™t finish
 it. And I shared the same  bunkbed with her, there 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
65 
 
 
were three -- they were three story high -- st
ories high, and we had 
the top bunkbed. And Hilde 
said, ﬁYou know, I can™t eat my food, do you want 
to finish it?ﬂ So I finished her food. And you 
know, typhus is very contagious, and I™m not 
even sure whether I used another spoon, we 
weren™t very careful. And one day Hilde died. A
nd we lost a few more 
kids. It was a terrible 
epidemic. And then we were told by Dr. Fre
und who also perished -- he was a gorgeous guy, a 
Czech guy, and the most bud -- bud -- body, I tell you, everybody was in love with this guy, but 

unfortunately he was ma rried. And he -- what 
this ma n did, he did -- he was a fairly young 
doctor, he wa s ma ybe in his mi d to late 30™s, andhe -- these doctors di -- 
did heroic things, they 
had no me di cines, they tried everything they coul
d. And he said to me , ﬁThe first thing you have 

to do is clean this place.ﬂ And we did get some  
Lysol, and we had a cleaning procedure that we 
cleaned every bunkbed. And we had the floors, a
nd the walls, and everybody helped, and the 
place stank from Lysol. And then the ghetto elders 
sh -- told everybody they had to -- they had to 
clean their pl aces, that was the only way to stop 
the epidemi c, and eventually the -- we managed 
to stop it. And my father and my 
brother got typhus too, 
but he did not get the real typhus, he got 
the paratyphus, which gives people a fever, but 
doesn™t affect their body the way the real typhus 
does, and he recovered from that. 

Q: And did you get typhus? 

A: No, I didn™t get a thing. 

Q: Even though you had eaten -- 

A: I had eaten, I was next to her, I ha -- I go
t nothing. I -- I -- how can you explain it? Nothing. 
Then we had another epidemic after -- well, le
t me  go on first. These were older ch -- young 
people, and they needed a -- what they called a 
betreuer, a person in charge of the young people, 
which was really 24 hour job. And they needed
 some body for younger children in another room. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
66 
 
 
And the head of our youth home, Sigi Kwasniewski
, who also perished, told me  that he was 
going to give me  a room by myself, and as there we
re at least 30 children in there, but that they 
were younger children, and a lot of them were or
phans, and a lot of them had come  fr om Poland. 
And they didn™t know what happened to their parents. And some  of the m were quite trauma tized, 

but wouldn™t talk about it. Th -- 
I got that room, but then Sigi
 Kwasniewski decided it was too 
much for one person. There was another woma n 
from Vienna, Trude Blau, who was made the 
head betreuer in that room, she was quite a bit olde
r than I was. She also had an affair with Sigi 
Kwasniewski, and that wasn™t a happy time for me. 
She was not an easy person to -- to deal with, 
and she was very ambitious, and eventually I --  she ma rried Sigi Kwasniewski, and she got a job 

in the -- what do they call it, the office of kanzle
i, and I had the sole resp
onsibility for my room. 
Q: Was thatbetter? 

A: Much better. Oh, I was all ready to quit. I wa
s ready -- I wa s going to go -- I hated to do that 
to -- to -- it™s -- it™s the st
range thing. You know, my mother
 and my aunts sent uncountable 
packages to the Red Cross, with fictitious se
nders, but I knew where they came from, because it 
came from -- anything close to my aunts. And ther
e were a few packages that came  fr om Vienna, 
and my father recognized my mo
ther™s handwriting, and he was sure my mother was alive in 
Vienna. But she made up all these -- these 
people, you know. Marie Unterbottom, and you -- you 
name  it, I mean, and she ma de up addresses. And my 
aunt told me  -- my a unts, after the war, that 
they constantly sent  packages. And my aunt 
did a lot of bartering 
because her husband made 

furniture, and it was in an area that was totally un
affected by the war, and she would barter with 
the -- with the farmers, and then she could use some  of the stuff to get vitami ns and things, and 

also sausage that was highly smoked so it woul
dn™t spoil. And even if we only got 10 or 20 
percent of the packages -- it di
dn™t go on all the time we were in Terezín, but for a period of time 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
67 
 
 
we got packages. And Trude™s brother, came dow
n with TB, and there wasn™t a package that  
came from my mother and my a
unts who I didn™t share the vitami
ns and the food with Herbert 
Blau. And hi -- and her parents never forgot th
at. So in other words, you know, we separated 
ways, but she al -- but she -- I 
don™t think she had bad feelings 
towards me  because I was very 
generous to Herbert. 
Q: Did you notice a lot of sexual act
ivity in Terezín?  That there 
were a lot of people coupling? 
A: We ll, there was a woma n, a Czec h woma n who was as sexy as anybody can imagine. And she 

was supposed to help me  in the room. She was 
mu ch older than I was, and I was horrified 

because we had ladders to go up to th -- to 
the third bunkbed, and she doesn™t -- didn™t wear 
underwear, and she was, you know, she was very se
xy, very flirty, and I™m sure she had her 
experiences. My kids were too small. There 
was no sexual activity. I had none. I™m sure that 
some  people did. I could have had 
it with Louis Lowy, but I -- it™s
 not that I was prude, I mean 
he just -- I -- I loved him as a 
friend, but he just didn™t turn me  
on. I™m sure there was a lot going 
on, especially among the  Czechs. Some  of the Germ
ans were quite ol d, but that™s all I witnessed. 
And the kids were really too 
small in my room. And then I™m
 thinking about the -- the people 
who had the same job that I had -- excuse me. 

Q: Sure. 

A: Louis was a good friend of mi ne. The idea to 
have any sexual contact with him, I couldn™t 
even have fathomed. The r e were Kurt Kohorn, 
who didn™t do anything for me  either, and he 
probably wasn™t interested in me  either. Whethe
r they had any sexual ac
tivities, I don™t know. I 
was younger than they we re. I mean, they were my friends, but -- because in ma ny wa ys I was 

ma ture, but sexually I™m not sure I was that ma ture, you know. 

Q: Right, right. Did you go to semi
nars and lectures and concerts? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
68 
 
 
A: Oh yes, oh yes, and don™t forget, in -- when
 we came to Terezín, we were not supposed to 
teach or  learn. That was strictly verboten. So 
all the teaching of our ch
ildren, all the lectures, 
were all done clandestinely. And 
I reme mber distinctly that we were taking turns watching 
whether the SS was descending into the camp, 
and giving, you know, sounding the alarm when 
they did, not knowing what they were up to. So -- 
Q: Do you reme mber hearing opera, or hearing -- 

A: Oh yes. 

Q: Yes? 

A: My brother sang in the 
children™s choir of Carme
n, he had a very good voice. 
Q: Really? 

A: Yeah, we saw Brundibar, and Carmen, and -- and I -- 

Q: And did he sing in Br undibar as well? 

A: Yes. 
Q: He did. 
A: Yeah, and the Angabilda ti conquer, and 
you -- you name  it. Natung avisor, you know, I 
mean, the things we did, and the talent we ha
d. I was nothing. I was a 
young girl who -- who had 
very limited experience, but I really ma tured ve
ry much a mong these people. We  had professors 
from Vienna and from -- from Ger ma ny, and th
ey would give lic -- 
lectures, and we had 
musicologists and I tried to -- to 
learn how to read music, and I™m 
not sure that I applied myself, 
or ma ybe I™m too stupid for it, but
 that I didn™t ma nage too we ll. We  had classes in algebra and 
arithmetic, particularly Louis, who was a lifelong
 friend of mi ne, was very bright. He eventually 
became a professor at BU, was a very close friend 
of my husband™s. He -- he tau -- he gave so 
ma ny lectures. And there was a biologist from Vie
nna, and -- and these peopl
e were so eager to -

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
69 
 
 
- to teach us, because we er -- weren™t suppos
ed to learn. If you are not supposed to do 
some thing, there is a tremendous incentive to do it. So
 yes, we  tried our best to educate our kids, 
but then there were transports going all the 
time . We had no clue where they were going. 
Q: You still had no clue. 
A: We  had no clue, especially the orphans. I mea
n, I still see them toda
y, some  of them. There 
were a couple of girls, one was very tall Mira Ha
nkriff, and one was very short. They had been 
orphaned. Their whole fa milies had been killed. A
nd they never talk muc h about it, and I think 
now if they had I™m not sure we could have even believed them. But they had for med such a 

bond with each other. I have ne
ver seen anything like that in
 young people, wa -- the bond they 
had. And it only remi nded me  of the bond Hannah a
nd Zdena and Buschi and I forme d later on. 

But, you know, this was -- there were -- kids were comi ng and going. And then you heard these 

rumors that there were s -- one transport came in 
with kids, they were all full of lice and they 
were so undernourished, and they were in such 
bad shape, and this and that was supposed to 
happen to them, and then there was a name , I don™t know where it come s from, ma ybe  there™s a 

Yiddish in it, bonkes, which means rumors. A
nything that anybody said that couldn™t be 
quantified, or really you didn™t 
know where it came from was cal
led bonkes. So they said, oh, 
these are just bonkes, you know, you can™t believe ev
erything you hear, they just ma ke all -- and 
these are kids, you know, they ma ke these things
 up. And then the Nazis 
send transports with 
orphans and young people and I reme mber this horribl
e thing where they said they were going to 
Switzerland, there was a transp
ort. And then later on we found out, you know, Switzerland was 
going into the gas. I don™t reme mber whether they
 went to -- which extermina-ination camp they 
went to. So, it was difficult to get news when 
you were in Terezín, and I™m afraid that we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
70 
 
 
weren™t any better than the outsi
de world. Even when we heard some  rumors, we didn™t believe 
them, you know. 
Q: We  need to stop the tape now -- 

A: Okay. 

Q: -- change the tape. 
End of Tape Five 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
71 
 
 
Beginning Ta pe Six 
Q: Do you reme mber the ﬁVerdi™s Requiemﬂ being sung? 
A: Yeah, but I don™t have very, very, you know, dis
tinct me mories of it, yeah. But I reme mber it 
was sung. 

Q: Right. 

A: Yeah, I don™t reme mber whether I saw it or  no
t, that -- you know, I -- I -- when I™m positive, 
I™m positive, you know? 

Q: Right. 

A: There -- there were lots of
 things going on, but I also had my
 job, and I couldn™t always attend 
everything that was going on. 

Q: Right.  

A: Yeah. 

Q: Do you reme mber some body by t he name  of Freddi Hirsch? 
A: Oh yes, definitely. 
Q: What do you know -- what do you know about Fred? 

A: We ll, Freddi -- I think Freddi perished in
 -- in the -- in Auschwitz. I get the goose bumps 
when I think of it. Freddi and a lot of fa milies 
were sent to Auschwitz to the Familienlager. And 

I don™t reme mber the -- the -- the mo nth when 
it was. I think it was in ™44, but I™m not, you 
know, I™m -- that was very unusual that they allo
wed whole families to go, but we didn™t know it 
was going to Auschwitz, but we -- only after the wa
r did I lear n that  they had this Familienlager 
in Auschwitz where they had set aside a whole 
area where families could live together , because 
in Auschwitz, as soon as you got there, th
e children and the wo me n and -- and me n were 
separated. And they were in Auschwitz for quite 
a long time . And Freddi had -- did a lot with the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
72 
 
 
children, and he was highly respected. But he had 
also some  contacts with people in Auschwitz, 
who had contacts knowing what was happening. And if
 I recall that -- my 
recollection after the 
war, when I came to Deggendorf, which was most ly
 occupied by survivors of Terezín, I think the 
Blaus told me , because you know, I -- we were not in -- in Terezín the whole time  any more, that 
Freddi and I forget who else, some body else who was very prominent, knew when the 

Fa milienlager was going to be eliminated. And they went through this terrible agony, whether 

they should inform everybody and fight back
 in some  way, and you know, and cause a 
tremendous disruption. All you could do is cause
 a disruption, because you had machine guns 

from all corners, I mean nobody could have any illu
si on that they could survive. And from what 
I understand, Freddi and some of the other people
 came to the conclusi on that if they will do so, 
they would cause such bedlam and such fear
, and nobody was going to be saved anyway, and the 
children, instead of going into the gas not knowing where they were going, they were going to 

be, you know, like hunted animals. And they all we
nt into the gas. Now, I don™t know if my 
recollection is correct. I™m sure you know Freddi 
Hirsch™s story. I was not in the family camp, so 

-- so I can only tell you what some  
of my friends told me happened. 
Q: Do you reme mber Freddi from Terezín? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Did you -- did you know hi m at all? 

A: Yes. 

Q: You did? 

A: Yes. 

Q: And wha t  was he like? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
73 
 
 
A: I we -- I mean, I reme -- I -- I wasn™t a cl ose fr
iend of his, but I reme mber him as th -- he was 
very sporty, he did a lot of s
ports with the kids, he was very
 encouraging. He -- he was, you 
know, the -- some  people you can™t analyze what ma
kes this guy be appreciated and respected by 
everybody?  What makes him a leader
?  And that was 
Freddi Hirsch. 
Q: Wa s he much older than you, a few y
ears older, do you have any recollection? 
A: I thought he was quite a few years older, bu
t I -- you see, when I came  to Auschwitz, in 1944 
-- I was born in ™26, so what -- I was 18 years ol
d. Freddi mi ght have been in his early 20™s, you 
know, but I can™t be -- in other words, you know, he 
-- I was this -- this 18 year old girl, not -- 
you know, ma ture as far as m -- my  ability to ta
ke care of young people, but sexually and every 
other way, I was not a very ma ture person. 
And young me n that age don™t bother with younger 
girls like Ursula, you know. 
Q: Right. 

A: They called him Uschi, by the way -- 
Q: Uschi?  
A: -- nobody knew me  as Ursula, yeah. Yeah. 

Q: But your fa mily didn™t call you Uschi? 

A: No, that came about -- well, so
me people did, but -- ma ybe alluded to, but in -- in Terezín 
everybody called me  Uschi. 

Q: Do you reme mber food in Terezín? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Was it horribl e? 

A: Well, it was horrible, but my father did so
 ma ny good deeds for the cooks, that we got much 
better food. I mean, was the same  type of food, 
but we got more of it, we got puddings, which 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
74 
 
 
nobody could even dream about. We got knoedle, 
you know, the dumplings. Yeah, he -- he -- he 
built -- you know, he could do anythi ng, and he built 
cabinets for the cooks and chairs for the 
cooks, and benches and all this for their qua
rters, and he was re
warded with food. 
Q: Right. 
A: We  got chocolate pudding, and we got -- we
 got all kinds of st
uff that he brought. 
Q: Chocolate pudding? 

A: Oh yes, chocolate pudding. Don™t forget, some of them al so cooked for the SS, you know. 

Q: Some  of these cooks. 

A: Yeah. Oh yeah, the cooks were -- th
ey were as fat as -- we hated them. 

Q: Yes? 

A: Yeah, we hated them. We had -- th-the Czechs 
ma ke a dish called knodlicki , which is -- it™s a 
flour dish like a dumpling with some sors -- sort of a buttery, sweet sauce on it. We  had some  of 

that, and -- and of course coffee, which was not 
coffee, which was like bl ack -- some  black sauce 
of some -- some sort. And spread
s which were undefinable what th
ey were, were supposed to be 

ma r malade, and wasn™t a real ma rmal ade, lot of
 artificial junk in it. On
e thing that mi ght be 
interesting to you is that I think they put so
me thing in our food, or ma ybe it was just the 
nourishment itself, but the -- most wome n didn™t me nistrate any more. 

Q: I was going to ask you. 

A: Yeah. I lost my -- I lost that , completely, 
until I came out of the camps, and then I think it 
took probably a year or more before it came bac
k. So -- and there were rumors that they put 
certain things in the food, I really don™t know, I have no clue what they did. 

Q: But in some  sense wa s that a relief or was 
that -- did that frighten 
women that they stopped 
their periods? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
75 
 
 
A: I don™t know that I thought much about it. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: It™s not some thing a young girl 
is too eager about anyway. They
 said they -- they put some  
additive, and I can™t reme mber 
what it -- some soda -- sor -- some -- something which is 
supposed to prevent me nistration, but I don™t 
know if that™s tr 
-- was true or not. 
Q: Yeah, I don™t think so. 

A: And they had black bread, you know, ho
rrible looking bread. But -- and potatoes -- 
Q: A lot of potatoes. 

A: -- in the skin, and a lot of them we re half 
rotten potatoes, but again, 
we had much be tter food 
than most, and so did my room, bec a use my fa
ther never just brought 
thefood for me  or my 
brother. Wa s our room, and Louis™ room. And L
ouis never forgot that either, and he smuggled 
things into there. 

Q: So you ate in your room with the kids? 
A: Oh yes. And also what my father did, when 
we -- when I took the room over, they kept their 
bread rations, all that stuff, in th
eir beds. And then my father felt 
that that was also breeding a lot 
of disease, and -- and el -- you know, fl -- we had a lo
t of fleas and all kinds 
of stuff. So he ma de 
a cupboard which had 30 compart ments in it, an
d each child had their own compart ments, and 
then in my room nobody was allowed to have any food in the compart me nts. These we re kids 

who were starved, and I can tell 
you, there was so much discip
line in my room. I was very 
young, but Papa Lenneberg, Papi they called him,
 because I called hi m Papi, he was only known 
as Papi. He told them, and -- and em -- 
emphasized that you don™t touch anybody else™s 
compart ment. And you know, in all that time , 
I don™t reme mber once a kid stealing out of 
another compartment. You know? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
76 
 
 
Q: And how old are these kids? 
A: Well, they were between -- 
they were about t -- 10 - 12 - 13. 
Q: Needing a lot of food, I would suspect. 

A: Yes. 

Q: Yes. 

A: But you know, like I said before, I didn™t sit th
ere and eat the stuff my father brought. We  
shared everything. And all the pack
ages that I got, they were opened on the table. There was a 
table with a long bench on each side, and -- and 
I would -- we  would cut everythi ng. We would 
cut th-the chocolate, and what
ever was in it, and everybody got some thing. And we shared. And 
I don™t recall that any other children got packag
es, because how ma ny children in -- in Terezín 
had aunts in Germany who c
ould do that kind of thing? 
Q: Right. 

A: You know, so with all my ve
nom against the Red Cross, you know
, we did th -- we -- because 
my venom, you know what they st
ems from, from -- from the Re
d Cross visit to Terezín. But 
then I sometimes think you™re not just -- the Red 
Cross did get a lot of packages in. Probably of 

the -- of a hundred packages, even
 if you -- if only 15 ma de it -- 
Q: That was some thing. 

A: -- and they were sent to my father, my brot
her, and to me . And then also, to Herbert Blau, 
because some how my -- my father was able to thank you for the package, and Herbert Blau 

really enjoyed it too. So then my aunt
s send another package to Herbert Blau. 
Q: And were you teaching these ki ds?  What did you do all da y? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
77 
 
 
A: I was learning, and I was teaching. I was read
ing with them, and I was lacking a lot of 
education, but I was also learning a lot and taking
 semi nars, etcetera. I did speak English quite 
well. 
Q: Really? 

A: Oh yeah, because my parents -- I mean, I had 
a lot of education, even 
when -- after our school 
was burned down, because I learned English and 
Spanish and some  French, which eventually 
was too much, because I was speaking French wi
th a Spanish -- I mean, was just ge tting too 
much. But whatever I learned, I taught my kids
. Then there were some  people who were very 

artistic, and they learned to draw, etcetera, a
nd make poems , they were encouraged to write 
stories. And then some  of these professors ga
ve lectures, and gave them home work, and they 
learned, and then if the SS came, eve r ything wa
s shoved aside, and we had certain places, you 
know, under the boards, and we would hide things
. And then later on, I 
think a lot of those 
restrictions were not enforced as much any more, yeah. 
Q: What was the mood of 
these kids?  Do you know? 
A: It depended. There we re some  who seemed so
me what depressed, especially the ones who had 
no fa mily. Were some  who very busy reading. 
Do you -- have you heard about Ruth Klueger? 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: She was in my room. 

Q: Really? 

A: She was one of my kids. And she is in a categ
ory all by herself. She wasn™t the eady -- easi est 
person. She wrote a book, as you know. 

Q: Yeah, I interviewed her. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
78 
 
 
A: She had a very bad relationship with her 
mother. And she upsets me  because her mother 
saved her life. I talked to he
r after she wrote the 
book. And she -- in her book she™s -- only has 
bad things to say about her mother. And I can™t 
help myself, I™m thinking about my family, my 
aunts, what I would give if they had survive
d. And she™s spewing all this venom, who actually, 
her mother saved her. Without her mother, she w
ould not have survived. But she is -- she was 
way beyond anybody else in intelligence, reading,
 she was devouring everything. And she had a 
friend, Hannah Ungar, who is now in Australia, 
which I didn™t know, Ruth Klueger told me . And 
these two, they were like this. And Ruth, she ha
ted every -- she hated he
r father, she hated her 
mother, she hated her relatives. 
Q: And was that clear th
en, that she was so -- 
A: No, she was -- it was -- was sh -- it was clear 
that she had a bad relationship with her mother, 
that was cl ear. But except for ha -- ha -- for Hann
ah Ungar, they -- they were very close. But the 
rest of the girls completely left  her al
one. She was in a category all by herself. 
Q: Was she difficult for you? 

A: She didn™t give me  too much trouble, and she -- 
it™s interesting how she -- she refers to me in 
her book without name , but as some body who is not much older than she was -- I mean, she™s a 

few years older than I am, and who was in charge of the room. But it wasn™t anything 

derogatory, or anything compli me ntary. 

Q: You™re just there. 

A: I was just there, I was just there. 

Q: Well, that ™s interesting. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Did you learn Czech? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
79 
 
 
A: A little bit, but not much, you know how you learn a language just  to ge t by a few things. I™d 
hardly know anything any more, but I 
-- I never really tried very hard. 
Q: So then who did you talk with? 

A: We ll, they all spoke some  English. On
ce you became friends -- English, some German. 
Q: German. Once you became friends. 

A: Once you became friends, they accepted you, they spoke German to you. 

Q: I see. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: But it couldn™t have been so easy to become  
friends if there was no language, or am I wrong? 
A: Well, they all speak -- I mean, the educated Czechs all speak German. 

Q: German.  

A: And -- but they hate German, like I hated German. 

Q: But that™s all you had. 
A: Yes, but I can understand them better, becausewhen I came  out of the camps, I spoke English 
very well, and I had to speak Germa n to my mo
ther, and to my fa mily. 
And my mother learned 
English very fast here. But if I could avoid Germ
an -- th-the language itse
lf just grated me , you 
know, it brought back so much, and I hated ever
ything German. And I think Hans helped me  a 
lot. I mean, I wouldn™t go as far as the Israelis 
who were trying to shake, you know, to -- to be 
aggressive to a pianist who is playing German
 music, but I couldn™t 
stand anything German, 
either . 

Q: Mm-hm. Do you remember 
your brother™s Bar-mitzvah -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- and what that was like? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
80 
 
 
A: Oh yeah. 
Q: Can you describe it? 

A: We ll, he was very good at it. I don™t reme mbe r that he ma de any mi stakes. And he was very 

bright. It was not a very festive 
thing for me, and I™m sure it was a terr ible thing for my father, 
because it brings -- br ought it ve ry much back th
at where™s a -- where™s my
 mother, and etcetera. 
But it was just some thing that he wanted to do, an
d my father -- I don™t recall whether my father 
ever said to him, you know, why do you have to 
do it. My father was such an agnostic, it didn™t 
matter to him. 

Q: But your brother wanted to do this? 

A: He wanted to do it, yeah, he wanted to do it. 

Q: And was it done in a synagogue, or a synagogue setting? 

A: No, there was no synagogue, but there wa
s a room that was used for services. 
Q: Right. 
A: And there were some  rabbis, and there was, y
ou know, I forget what that was Kline, or who -- 
who coached him, I don™t reme mber . I have -- 
would have to ma ke it up, I don™t reme mber. The 
reason, excuse me , I think I don™t re
me mber is, don™t forget, this was very close to the time when 
we were deported to Auschwitz. And some how th
ere, lots of things became a blur, you know. 
Q: Yeah, cause this is Se ptember ™43, 
and you™re deported in October, you know. 
A: Not ™43. We were deported i-in ™44. 

Q: ™44. 

A: Yeah, yeah.  

Q: So it™s a year later. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
81 
 
 
A: Yeah, but still, you know, there -- so ma ny 
things happened, it -- it seemed a short time. 
Maybe it was a year, but I don™t reme mber exactl
y. Maybe I wasn™t totally with it. And I don™t 
reme mber who the instigator was. I can™t believe
 it was Louis, who was in charge of his room, 
because Loui s was an agnostic too. But some body 
must have persuaded him he should ma ke his 
Bar-mitzvah. And my father was in a room on a -- in 
a different street, in a 
different house, with 
a couple of guys who were quite Orthodox [indeciphe
rable]. So whether they had an influence, 
they probably had an influence. 
But I can™t recall that. I don™t want
 to claim anything I can™t be -- 
yeah. 
Q: Right, right. Maybe ritual counts in thos
e time s, even if you don™t have a belief. Maybe. 

A: I think that it -- th-t hat™s what it was to
 a large degree. I me an, I started to learn 
[indecipherable] in Israel. I mean
 the -- in -- in Terezín. I really
 wanted to go, if we would get 
out of this mess, I wanted to eventually 
go to Palestine. There was no Israel then. 
Q: Right. 
A: And I really wonder if I would 
have ended up in -- in Palestine 
if my mother hadn™tsurvived. 
But I found -- I felt that it was just too much to
 ask my mother to go to th -- what was then 
Palestine, the conditions, and for her to learn Ivri
th would have been a lot harder than to -- you 
know, she knew a little English. I 
think the idea probably wo -- came to me because when you 
have been persecuted, you just wonder whet
her you can exist among non
-Jews. You feel so 
vulnerable, the idea that ther
e could be a country where pe
ople are of your ma ke-up, and 
wouldn™t persecute you because you are a Jew.
 There is some thing attractive to that. 
Q: Right. 

A: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
82 
 
 
Q: In -- a couple of mont hs after your brother™
s Ba r-mitzvah, there™s a huge, sort of -- everybody 
is taken out of the barracks. 

A: Oh, ma ybe that™s why I don™t reme mber
 the Bar-mitzvah too well. Yeah, sure. 
Q: Cause this is Novemb er ™43, right? 

A: Mm-hm, yeah, that was the worst day I ever experienced in Terezín. One day we were all 

herded into the Bauschowitz basin. And the reas
on for that was given by the commandant of the 
SS, that th-the elder had not give
n the right numbers of inma tes. 
Q: This is Edelstein?  

A: Yeah. And then I think he just had some  
venom against Edelstein, who was a wonderful ma n, 

and he also, if I reme mb er it correctly, I think 
accused Edelstein of usi
ng his bicycle and riding 
beyond the borders of was permitted in the ghetto. 
And they herded us into the Bauschowitz 
basin. And it was a very drizzl
y day. Young and old, and some  of 
these old people were in such 
decrepit condition, and we were supposed to be c
ounted, because the count didn™t jive, as far as 
the SS was concerned. And we had to stand ther
e at attention for hours 
and hours and hours with 
the rain coming down. And SS were stationed -- 
the basin was like a flat area, and it was 
surrounded by a dirt wall, and they
 were positioned on the dirt wa
ll with machine 
guns, etcetera. 
And we were sure we™re all going to be murder
ed right there on that 
-- in that basin. And you 
know, they -- they were beating people up, and 
they were screaming and they had their guns 
drawn, they were very intimida
ting, and it was just horrible. And everybody thought this is it, 
we™re going to be executed. And then eventu
ally, was already beyond 
dusk, I don™t reme mber, 
was very, very late, we were all herded back
 into the ghetto. And I don™t reme mber how ma ny 

people were in Terezín at the time , but the ghetto
 was very full of people. What -- I™ve to -- 
forget what the height of the population was, 
40,000 or some thing like that. And that was about 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
83 
 
 
it, because after we came back, shortly after, th
ere were lots of tran
sports going east out of 
Terezín. And while we were in 
the Bauschowitz basin, the SS s
earched the -- the houses, the 
youth home s. They ripped out ma ttresses and I d
on™t know what all, they were looking for 
valuables. Then they had the excuse that some body had hidden valuables and money, because 
you were not supposed to keep any of that. And 
actually, I understood -- I was not a witness to 
that, that in fact in one place in our building, 
that they found some money some where, and that 
that person was taken into the Kleine Festung, 
which was a notorious prison. But I -- I was not 

an -- an eyewitness to that, I wa
s an eyewitness to when we came back and everythi ng was torn 
apart. Yeah, that was a ve ry scary time. It was -- it was awful. 

Q: Now, you me ntioned that Ed
elstein was a wonderful ma n. 
A: Yes. 

Q: Ho -- do -- is this by re
putation that 
you say this? 
A: Yes, and I me t hi m a few times, not that he had any interest in Uschi Pa wel -- Uschi 
Lenneberg, but there were occasions
 that he came to the youth home  and stuff, and I thought he 
was a very nice, mild ma nnered ma n. Not everyb
ody in the Judenrat had the same  reputation. 
Murmelstein had a terrible reputation. And you s
ee, that is the just
ice of the world. Wh o 
survived?  Ra bbi Murmelstein. 
Q: Right. 

A: And he had the reputation among us that he 
was hand in glove with the SS. And Edelstein 
was deported to Auschwitz, and so were ma ny of
 the others. And one 
of the people on the 
Judenrat, Zucker, was on our transport, 
and also sent right into the gas.  
Q: Okay, we have to stop
 and change the tape.  
End of Tape Six

Q: Uschi. 
A: Uschi, yeah. We ll -- 

Q: Do you reme mber your birthday party? 

A: Yes. 

Q: When you were 18? 

A: Yes. I still have -- I still have that™s -- 
I should -- why didn™t I bri
ng that?  Buschi -- well, 
when -- you mean in Terezín the birthday party? 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Yes, I reme mber that, but I was th
inking about another birthday party -- 
Q: Oh yes? 

A: -- in Merzdorf, yeah. 

Q: Oh, well, we™ll talk about that later.  
A: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Q: Wa s it nice in Terezín? 

A: Yes, the kids ma de all kinds of l
ittle presents for me , you know, handmade. 

Q: The little -- oh, the kids
 you were taking care of? 
A: Yes. And they -- they put on a play for me , 
and it was a complete surprise, and my brother -- 
and he -- ya -- ma  -- wrapped up li
ttle tiny things, things that proba
bly my father got for him, and 
-- and he put on it, Für me ine liebe schwester. 

Q: Aw. 

A: Yeah.  

Q: So this was not an adult party, th
is was a party for these kids, yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
85 
 
 
A: No, this was my chil -- my kids
, and my father and my brother. 
Q: And your brother. 
A: And ma ybe Louis and a few of the be
treuer, but I don™t reme mber exactly -- 

Q: Right, right. 

A: -- but it™s the kids that 
ma de the big impression -- 
Q: Yeah. 

A: -- because they had -- you know, had this pl
ay that they made up, somebody had written it, 
and I don™t even reme mb er the -- to be truthful, 
the contents of the pla
y, I was so overwhelmed 
by the whole thing. 

Q: And since you were with them so much, when 
could they have rehearsed, and done all this? 
A: Yeah, I -- they could have because I had a lo
t of friends there, and they could have done it 
with the -- all kinds of excuse
s, you know. Appa rently there we
re a few people helping them, 
yeah. 
Q: I see. That™s very sweet. 
A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: And I™m sure you reme mber the pending Re
d Cross visit. Do you remember all the 
preparation for this? 

A: I reme mb er everything because my kids were part of some  of this. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Not that they volunteered, I mean, they were 
just told. The Red Cross 
was going to visit, and 
we had what was called verschöne
rung, beautification. And first of 
all, they had a huge transport 
leaving Terezín, to ma ke the town look less 
crowded, that was the first thing. Then the 
commandant felt he didn™t want any 
ugly and old Jews in the streets.
 So when he saw like an old 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
86 
 
 
person, or -- some  of his deputies went in a
nd rounded up old people, and they came into the 
next transports. And transports 
were going constantly, to the east
. Of course we know now they 
went to Auschwitz. And then people were given 
the job to clean the st reets, they actually 
scrubbed the streets, the sidewalks,
 with soap and water. They got
 paint, they painted the houses. 
They started to build a -- an 
area and decorated it with flower
s and green to ma ke way for the 
orchestra. And another one for the band shell. Th
en they -- they establishe d a café. And they 
would just go and say you -- I mean, some  good l ooking young wome n, you, you, you, you™re 
going to be the waitresses. And these waitresse s were strutting around with little white doily 

aprons, and you know, those curlicues, stupid stuff 
in their hair, and they were going to wait on 

customers in the café house. They
 -- some  of our kids were rounde d up, and they had to approach 
the SS Kommandant, who was an awful guy, and ca
ll him uncle. I wasn™t involved directly 
myself, I just  visited all this, I just saw all that . 
One thing I did see, that 
the elder, our elder, was 
decorated with a gold chain a
nd a new suit and Nazi limousines were chauffeuring him around 
with the people from the Red Cross. 

Q: This is Ma rmelstein -- Murmelstein. 

A: Yeah. And so it was -- it was a stage and we 
were the actors. And they
 were planting flowers 
all over, and the band was playing. And then they 
started -- they established a bank -- I™m trying 

to reme mber, a store. And -- and 
they made this fake Theresie
nstadt money, which on one side 
had Moses with the 10 commandment
s, on the other side it had 
the -- you know, the ghetto in 
kröne, I think it was, 20 - 50 or 
what kröne. And then the trans
ports, which were always comi ng 
and going in Terezín. You know that
 they confiscated all the su
itcases. We ll, they took some  
stuff out of these suitcases and they
 put this -- this stuff in the st
ores to be sold, supposedly. So 
the Red Cross got the impression th
ey have a this store and a that
 store, and they have a bank, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
87 
 
 
and they have the -- they have a barber and they  have a beauty parlor and so on, and so on. I™m -- 
it was unreal. Houses were scrubbed and painte
d. And then these idiots fro m the Red Cross, 
that™s why e -- e -- ev -- ever
 since I came out of Terezín, I ha
ve no good word for the Red Cross. 
They would -- they were dined -- wined a
nd dined by the SS, and riding around in the SS 
limousine through Terezín. Do you think they got out
 once to ask anybody a 
question?  Or to try 
to go into one of the houses?  I mean, they didn
™t even go into the barrack, nevermind these 
individual houses, where old people were put in 
the attic, like my grandmot
her. And they had not 

any more space than that rug in the foyer there, 
to just spread their blanket, and -- during the 

heat, or the cold, or whatever. A
nd so these -- so ma ny peopl e died 
in Terezín in -- in those days, 
it -- before -- even before -- died before th
ey had a chance to transp
or t them to Auschwitz. 
Q: So the Red Cross, th -- they didn™t walk around 
at all, they just -- in the car, the whole time? 

A: N-N-No, they -- they were in  the car, and if they walked 
around -- they mi ght have walked 
around and strutted around where the band was, a
nd where everything -- the SS wanted them to 
see. They -- I didn™t see it myself, but they mi ght
 have walked into the bank or stuff and -- and 
convinced themselves that this was a wonderf
ul Jewish town where, you know, Hitler schenkt 
den Juden eine stadt. Wh ere Hitler wa s giving th
e Jews a present of a -- 
of a -- of a town. And 
they swallowed it all, 
lock, stock and barrel. 
Q: Do you reme mber a film being made, you -- 

A: Oh yes, and I rem -- I knew Kurt Gerron very well. 

Q: You did? Uh-huh. 

A: Kurt Gerron was a filmmaker from Holland, a
nd he was rounded up by the Nazis, and he was 
brought to Te rezín. And Kurt, I don™t know whether he originally came  fr om Holland, but I am 

quite sure I reme mber that he was 
-- he was arrested in Holland. At
 least that™s what I was told. I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
88 
 
 
see him with -- this remi nds me -- of course, 
this was 1944, of all his equipment, ma ki ng this 
film. And, you know, as I said before, we were a st
age, we were the actors. My kids were -- were 
in the films. And as soon as Kurt Gerron had finished the film, he was put into a transport to 
Auschwitz, and perished. So yes, I will never forget that . 

Q: And how did you come  to know him?  

A: I think he came to the youth home. I also ca
me  to know him -- not -- you know, we were not 
friends, but I spoke to him because he  wanted s -- he
 needed some  of the kids to be part of what 

he was filmi ng. And some  of the kids had been 
selected, I don™t reme mber it was the SS or who, 
they needed so and so many kids. And some  of my
 kids were in that. A
nd I didn™t even see the -- 
the elder, that he had this gold 
chain on. My kids told me  that. Y
ou should have seen him, he had 
-- he had a new suit, and a gold chain, and he 
was being driven around, you know, as a ma yor of 

the city, with the Red Cross. 

Q: So it ma de you live him even more? 
A: Oh God. No, I -- and we all feel that way, I 
mean he came from -- from Vienna, and Dita and 
Louis, and Dita still is my very good friend, she 
still lives in Boston, a
nd Louis we lost ma ny -- 
before Hans died, ma ny years ago. And di -- Dita
 came from Vienna. She hated this guy. I mean, 
nobody liked him. But he survived. And he co
llaborated very much
 with the Nazis. 
Q: Mm-hm. So the Red Cross is there in May of 1944, right? 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: A few months later your father gets a deporta
tion. It -- it seems, a -- at
 least according to your 
book, that there™s a notice th
at come s  to your father
 about being deported. 
A: Yeah, I happened to be in his room -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
89 
 
 
Q: When he got it? 
A: Yeah, and he got it, it wasn™t
 sent by ma il. These notices were 
given to the elders, they were 
either the room elders or the house elders. My 
father was in Q 600 dreizehn, I think it was, 613 
in a -- it was like a pr ivate home originally. And th
e elder -- I was visiting my
 father in his room, 
and the elder come s in and hands him the summons 
from the SS that he has to present himself on 
such and such a date, and he changed color. A
nd I never forget that. And then we had a big 
struggle, and -- and it was my fault, and -- and 
it haunted me  for years and years. And I pressed 
him that we should join him. And I should have 
never done that, and he f
ought me  tooth and nail. 
And I said to him, ﬁ Wel l, what was the purpose of you and Bübchen going with me ?  And then 

now we™re going to be separated again. I mea
n, the idea was that we were going to stay 
together.ﬂ So I decided that Papi
 is going next week, and I am 
going the week after, and Bübchen 
is going to be all by himself. So we went with
 him, supposedly to a labor camp near Dresden. 
See, that was the terrible thing, and they say 
that Murmelstein knew wh
ere we were going, and -- 
and he helped the Nazis by fac
ilitating, you know, their mi rage, we
 were going to a labor camp. 
Q: Now, but you think at this point  that 
your father knows what™s going on, because -- 
A: I don™t know, he -- all I can te
ll you is that when he came back from Zossen, which is near 
Berlin -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- where he worked in Tiefbau supposedly, what was it, for the bunker -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- that Hitler™s bunker, and he came in touch with
 a lot of other workers from different camps, 
he seemed like a changed person. But he also kne
w that transports were leaving Terezín on a 
daily -- on a daily is too much, but 
at -- on a weekly, or some times da
ily basis, to in quote, other 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
90 
 
 
labor camps. So ma ybe he also felt
 that we are all going to be gett
ing out of here sooner or later, 
and now we at least know where we are going, and 
I can™t recall at all, 
I mi ght have it in my 
book, what the name  of t he labor camp was that we
 were supposed to go to. It was near Dresden, 
and my father was familiar with the name , a
nd that sounded pretty good. And this -- we were 
told that by the -- by the elder, by Murmelstein, th
at our transport was going to that place. And I 
reme mber when we were on the train, which ev
entually ended up in Auschwitz, my fat her and 
some  of his friends were looking through, you know
, it™s trying to see where they were, which 
wasn™t always possible, and they f -- one of them
 said, ﬁOtto,ﬂ to my fath
er, ﬁwe™re not going,ﬂ -- 
it™ll come to me, the name of th
at place, ﬁwhere we can™t possibly go there, we™re alya  -- already 
east of Dresden.ﬂ And that™s when he changed 
color, and when it probably sank in, we™re not 
going to a labor camp, we™re going east of Dresde n, we™re going to go to one of the camps in 

Poland, and I think that -- this is
 conjecture, I have no proof of th
at -- I think that ma ybe he did 
meet up with people. He told me  that there we
re people from different 
-- different ghettos, or 
whatever he said, who were working with him 
on the bunker. And so I think that he got a good 
idea what wa s going on in some  of t he eastern camps.
 But I really feel that
 he believed that our 
transport was going to a labor camp near Dresden. 

Q: But nevertheless, you had to
 fight with him about going? 
A: Yes, I did, and he didn™t want me  to go. 

Q: Right. And you won. 

A: But -- I won, unfortunately, and 
believe me , it™s laid on me  --  
Q: Yeah. 

A: -- for -- it still does to this 
day. Because then I figured if we 
hadn™t gone, because there were -
- we were not the last trans
port to leave Terezín, as you know, but ma ybe we would have had 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
91 
 
 
enough of a respite that we would have stayed. 
And my father was such a strong, healthy ma n, 
that ma ybe he would have had a chance to surviv
e. What I really think happened -- and this 
again, is conjecture -- when we got to Ausc
hwitz, of course you know wome n and me n had -- 
were separated, and my father was with my brother,
 and my br other was in his winter coat, it was 
Poland, and it was October, and you know, that he
 had outgrown, and he didn™t look like a -- you 
know, very big teenager, and I 
think Mengele, who happened to 
select us, probably put my 
brother on one side, and my father on the other, 
but my father, I™m sure, would not have let his 
son go alone, and ma ybe said can
™t I go with my son, not knowi
ng where he was going. Maybe 
even if he had known where he was going, he
 wouldn™t have let my brother go alone. 
Q: Wa s this at the begin -- do you reme mber
 if it was the beginning of October?   
A: Yes, at the very beginning oc -- 

Q: At the very beginning. 

A: -- of October. 
Q: So it -- it™s before the uprising? 
A: Yes. It was at the be
ginning of October, yeah. 
Q: We ll, you know, you couldn™t have
 known either. You didn™t know. 
A: No, I -- believe me , it™s been on -- it™s been 
-- and you know, I want to
 tell you something, I 
never discussed this too much with my mother. 
She asked me questions a
nd I told her the truth. 
And I don™t know, ma ybe I camouflaged 
it a little bit, but 
I couldn™t even talk about it, because I 
really felt that burden for such 
-- for the rest of my life. 
Q: And you still feel it. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
92 
 
 
A: I have my brother and my fath
er [indecipherable] deaths, and I 
feel I™m responsible that they 
aren™t here any more.  
Q: You didn™t kill them. 

A: But it was the wrong thing to do. Was absolutely 
the wrong thing to do, cause he really didn™t 
want us to go with him. Of course, we didn™t kn
ow that we were fairly close towards the end of 
the war. We  didn™t get -- you know, that™s been 
-- so ma ny times there were hopeful news, that 
oh, the allies are here, and ther
e, and the Russians are very
 close, and -- and it never 
ma terialized. So we really didn™t know. But it™
s -- it™s done, you know, it™s a long time. Ma -- ma  
-- as you get older and you have so
ns like I do, who are now -- my olde
st son is the same  age that 
my father was when he was killed. You know, 
I mean, you -- you get from his history, he was a 
strapping man, he was -- he could do anything, wh
ether it was carpentry or -- or digging ditches, 
or what. Physical work -- not everybody was ab
le to do that. People collapsed, people gave up 
because they couldn™t do it. We ll, he could. But we
 came to the point, and I think I had a part in 
it where you couldn™t -- th
ere™s nothing you could do. 
Q: But you -- you probably need to reme mber that the family ma de a decision early on to join 

you. 

A: I know, I know, I know, this -- 

Q: So everybody™s ma king decisions base
d on what they think is the best. 

A: I know, my husband talked to me .  

Q: But rationality doesn™t count when
 you have certain kinds of feelings. 
A: No, no, no. 

Q: So you are separated fr om your brother and your father, and -- 

A: Right, right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
93 
 
 
Q: -- do you know that they were killed imme di
ately?  Is that what 
you think, or you don™t know? 
A: We ll, I™ll tell you how I found 
out that they were killed. Y
ou know, we got off t he train, and 
we had to form in fives, and I reme mber trying 
to look back to see my father and my brother. 
This was a huge, huge transport, enormous. All I 
could see is a sea of people. And then looking 
down towards the camps, all I could see is high te
nsion wires, and barrack after barrack after 
barrack. And then we were pushed again to walk pa
st this el egant looking SS offi cer with shiny 
boots and leather gloves, either poi
nting to the left, or to -- poi
nting to the right. I didn™t -- I 
didn™t know what that meant. I followed where he 
pointed to. And then we had to form in fives 
again, and there was an SS ma n to the left of me
, and he pushed us into this muddy r oad, which 
was snaking between camps. And whenever 
a transport arrived in Auschwitz, nobody was 
allowed to get out of the barrack. But some how 
a woma n was outside of 
the barrack, very close 
to the electric wire, and rec
ognized some body in our transport, 
and screamed out a name , and 
cried. And this SS ma n, who was next to me , 
fairly young, ma ybe 18, s o me thing like that, with 
his rifle drawn, screamed at her, 
ﬁGet in or I™ll shoot you.ﬂ And w
ith that he shot her. And she 
screamed, and she was lying there, literally 
in the mud, pooled in her own blood, and I was 
convinced then I would neve
r get out of there alive. 
Q: And that™s the first time you thought that? 
A: I have ne -- had never seen a person being shot
. There were people being killed in Terezín in 
the Kleine Festung, but I was not wi
tness to it. And apparently there were some  people shot in 
the basin when we had the counting, but I didn™t 
-- nobody close to me . That was the first time  I 
ever saw a pe rson being shot point blank. And th
at is something I willnever erase out of my 
mi nd. And I think this is when I decided, not cons
ciously, to just not ev
en see what was going on 
around me . And then we were, as you know, we™re
 put into a s -- brought into a sauna and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
94 
 
 
stripped of everything. Our hair 
was shorn, our body hair was shor
n and w-we were screamed at. 
I never forget that sauna for therest of my life. It was a very large room, it was a brick building, 
and there were SS lined -- ma le SS lined on bot
h sides of the walls, ma
king dirty jokes. You 
know, we were all naked while we were being sh
aved. And that is too much for anybody to even 
think reasonably. I mean -- 

Q: Prisoners shaved you, yes? 

A: Prisoners shaved us. 

Q: Did they talk to you at all? 

A: No, they were too busy. And -- and they coul
dn™t even tattoo us any more because by that 
time they -- they couldn™t  -- they
 had so ma ny transports comi ng 
in, they weren™t tattooing any 
more. They did these idiotic things. They gave
 us dirty dresses, no underwear, no socks, just 
wooden clogs and a dirty dress, and this is the -- 
Poland, the winter, in October. And then we had 
to get past another prisoner who 
had a -- a can of red paint, and put
 a stripe of glossy red paint on 
this black, lousy rags that I had on. I mean, really
 idiotic things. And then they pushed that into 
the muddy road again, it was still raining, and that™s
 when we  ended up in Birkenau in one of the 
-- the barracks. And they couldn™t cope with al
l the people they had. Buschi claims we were 
eight on a cot, Zdena says we were seven on a 
cot. It doesn™t ma tter. We  could -- nobody could 
turn without everybody else turn
ing. And we never saw utens
ils. We -- there was one dirty 
blanket to cover all of us, and it was so filthy it
 was horrible. And then the next morning, people 
came in to -- or the next day some  time, they brought in some  soup, some -- you know, in -- in a 

big canister, and they dished it out into metal dishes, and each plank bed got one metal dish, and 

we had to use our hands to eat, and it was quite
 liquid, that stuff. And 
whoever could shovel it 
the faster -- in the fastest got the most. But I don™
t reme mber whether it was the same day, I think 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
95 
 
 
it was the following day, that there were a few people who threw themselves against the electric 
wire. And men came in to pick up the dead, and-- with pushcarts. And one of the me n was a 

friend of mi ne, and he knew my fa
ther, too, he wa s in our transpor
t. And he -- his wife was also 
in my ca mp, and he whispered to his wife, ﬁTe
ll Uschi that  Walter and O
tto didn™t ma ke it.ﬂ And 
she told me that. And from that day on, I never 
had any hope that my father or my brother had 
survived. And then, year s later, the Holocaust 
museum, my brother and my father™s name s are 
right there. The wonderf
ul Nazi records -- 
Q: Of who t h ey killed. 

A: Of -- they were killed that same  day. 

Q: That same day? 

A: That same day. 

Q: Okay, let™s stop the tape 
and we™ll change the tape. 
End of Tape Seven

Beginning Ta pe Eight 
Q: Do you have any recollection of th
e uprising at the end of October? 
A: Mm- mm.  
Q: No. You didn™t 
hear anything? 
A: You me a n in Auschwitz? 

Q: In ow -- I™m sorry, in Auschwitz. 

A: No, I don™t. I think I was too 
occupied with myself. I was too 
new in -- in Auschwitz. I didn™t 
know people well enough. The only thing that is rea
lly imprinted on my memory is this incident, 
I don™t know if -- if you read it in my book, when 
we had selection and the Hungarian girl fled 
into our barrack. I don™t -- and I al
so learned from other prisoners, 
and I really didn™t believe it, 
that they were doing experime nts on people, and I 
didn™t believe that either
. I just -- I mean, I 
just could not comprehend some  of the things that I heard. 

Q: So, did you not believe they were gassing people?   
A: No, that I believed. 
Q: You believed it. 

A: I believed that, and I -- and I know that my 
fr iends from Terezín, the Hirschfeld™s wouldn™t 
have told me that my father and my brother didn
™t make it into the camp, that was ri ght after I 
arrived. And I learned from others in the camp that 
people were being gassed, and that -- that this 
-- ther e was a horribl e smell in Auschwitz, too. 

Q: I was going to ask you. 

A: But I think I experienced that mor e  when I wa
s selected for work. We ll, before I was selected 
for work, we had this horrendous experience with
 the Hungarians girls. They were fairly young 
girls, and there was as -- some
 of these people who had been in Auschwitz for any length of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
97 
 
 
time, they didn™t look like human beings any mo
r e. They™re called the mu sselmen, a -- I don™t 
know where the heck that came from, but they were
 really walking skeletons. And their skin, and 
the expressions on their faces, and 
their eyes, th -- cannot be described. And next to our barrack 
was a barrack that housed Hungarian wome n. 
A l ot of young wome n, who had been there a 
relatively long time for Auschwitz
, you know, a number of months, 
and they have been through I 
think what -- two selections before, so there were
 no older people left in 
that barrack, they were 
all younger pl -- people. But they we
re comi ng closer di -- to the 
description of these musselmen. 
They were in terrible shape. And they had a selektion, and of course, I did -- never heard of a 
selektion, we  had only been in th
ese barracks for a relatively short time , and they were shooting, 
and we thought this is it, they™re going to just
 shoot everybody around. And 
then one of the girls 
ma naged to get into our barrack. 
And apparently another girl was 
killed, was shot by the SS, but 
our elder, our block elder knew th
is girl, and they had been in
 Auschwitz for a long time , and 
apparently she has -- had escaped selektions a number of times. And here we were fairly new, 
and all this was -- we were being told all these 
horrors that I couldn™t di
gest. And here, I will 
never forget this girl, she™s st
anding there at the end of the ba
rrack, and the block elder, who 
seemed like a pretty brutal woman herself, was sh
ielding her. And she told
 us that she™d been 
there for such and such a time, she™d been selected a few time s , and that people were being 
selected after they were not physically strong 
any more, and they were being gassed. And she 
gave such a vivid description and she told us
 about how ma ny of her friends had been -- had 
been gassed, that it finally dawned on me , ma  -- ma
ybe this is true. Maybe this is so. It wasn™t 
just when you come  there that they select you 
like Mengele, but they select you afterwards. Now 
that was -- that wa -- ma de a terrible impressi
on on me . And then shortly after that, we had a 
selektion for work. And it was a fairly large tabl
e outside, and it was pretty
 cold, and we had to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
98 
 
 
all strip naked again, and walk in front of this 
table. And there was a ma n, a representative from 
industry at one end, and two SS offi
cers at that table. And he sele
cted very few people. And we 
were kind of standing in line, na
ked. And when I got to this man from industry, he asked me  to 
show him my hands, which I did. I -- I don™t have
 a very small, fancy hand. And then h-he 
motioned obviously that he was going to take me  
for work at the factory he represented. And the 
people selected for work, as I said before, were
 a relatively small number. And we we re then 
pushed into the road again, and you know, we ha
d -- we could put a -- we only had a dress 
anyway, put our dress on, was pushed into the road. 
And we were put into a s -- we were in front 
of another sauna, a bath house, and by that time,
 I believe that people were being gassed, because 
we could smell the burning flesh, really. And when
 the SS guard told us that we had to strip 
naked before we even got into the shower house, 
the sauna, I really thought that was it, because I 
also had learned that people were gassed in a sa
una, that the gas came  through the shower heads. 
So it was welcome when we fe lt the ice cold wate
r dripping on our skin. A
nd we again just got a 
shift, and no underwear, no socks. And we were
 pushed into the road and we ended up in a 
wome n™s camp, which had mostly non-Jews in it. Ibelieve they were all 
Polish, at least the ones 
I saw. The elder was a Pole. And they had differe
nt insignias, which I 
learned there designated 
whether they were political prisoners or murder
ers. And I understood from
 people there that the 
block elder was a murde r er, that 
this particular triangle or what
ever she wore, repr esented the 
identification of a murderess. And she was very 
brutal, and horrible, and she beat people very 
readily. And she s -- put -- she gave
 us different chores to do, a
nd one of the chores that she 
dished out for me, was t o carry the feces to th
e latrines during the night, with another woma n, 
and accomp anied by a Nazi guard. You know, the wome
n we re not SS, they were Nazi guards in 
uniform. And I shall never forget 
that night. It was a very dark
 night, and there was a horrible 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
99 
 
 
smell, and the whole sky was bright red. And thes
e very tall chimneys were spewing particles 
into the air. And the woma n who 
carried the buckets with me , w
ho had been in Auschwitz a lot 
longer than I had, she said, ﬁAnother transport 
must have arrived. These are our people going 
through the chimney.ﬂ You know, a norma l person w
ould have collapsed right there and there, 
and I don™t think things really penetrated. We  
had much better bedding and plank beds. They 
were the same  size, but instead of, you know, eight 
people, or whatever, or 
seven or whatever we 
were on one, there were three of us. One was 
Zdena from Prague, and one was Buschi from 
Amsterdam.  And we became friends for life. And 
one day we were told to get ready for work 
and we were ma rched to the railroad trestle, and 
we  were put into a transport. And I cannot recall 
how long we were on transport, but then the trai
ns stopped eventually -- because we were in 
cattle cars, and there was really no way -- you know, 
some  cattle cars were ol
der, and they were -
- you -- you had an idea, looking through some of 
the little spaces, but there weren™t too ma ny 
spaces to be  found. And we ended up in a place ca
lled Kudowa-Sackisch. In other words, we had 
been going west, not east. This was an airpla
ne factory, and the ma n who had selected me 
worked -- wa s a repr esentative of that airplane  f
actory. And I never forget th
at night. We  were so 
happy. The beds were better, the blankets were 
wonderful, the food was better. And, for the first 
time, we had shower, a hot shower, and we got 
a piece of soap. And then the next morning we 
had to form a circle in the fact
ory yard, and the German fore ma n stepped into the mi ddle of that 
circle, and he looked around, and he decided 
he didn™t like anybody to work for him in the 
factory who wore eyeglasses. I wore glasses and 
Zdena wore glasses, Buschi did not. And he -- 
we stepped forward. At first I didn
™t want to step forward. And Bu
schi said to me , ﬁHa ven™t we 
played enough fate? ﬂ  You know, and she was referri
ng to my  volunteering to go with my father, 
and my father and my brother going with me , an
d I put my glasses back on. And of c ourse he 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
100 
 
 
selected me  to step forward, and Zdena step fo
rward. And then for some  reason, he told Buschi 
to step forward. And you know, either Zdena or I sa
id to her, ﬁBut you don™t wear glasses.ﬂ So, I 
never forget Buschi™s words. She said, ﬁThat™s fa
te. It™s supposed to be that way.ﬂ ﬁDas ist das 
Schicksal. Es soll so sein.ﬂ And there were six of
 us, and he called us garbage, rejects, who were 
not going to work in his factory, 
and we were going to be sent back to Auschwitz. And we were 
rounded up by a woma n, a Nazi guard, but she was di
fferent from any of the guards that we had 
encountered. She didn™t scream at us, she was kindof nice, she ki -- she some how be haved as if 
she didn™t belong there. Now, I don™t know what he
r history was, whether she wad -- was drafted 
into that, who knows?  But she -- sh
e took us to the railroad trestle, 
and then I did some thing I felt 
terrible about for a long, long time. And Buschi 
and Hannah and Zdena were very upset with me , 
because they felt very strongly that I had saved th
eir lives. It wasn™t just
 -- there was one other 
woma n. The r e were two other wome n who felt the sa
me  way, but we kind of lost contact after 

liberation. And I pleaded with this guard, and I 
told you she seemed more accessible, be cause I 
would have never dreamt to do this
 in Auschwitz with any guard. 
And I pleaded for my life, and 
I told her that I shouldn™t be ther e. I was really
 not Jewish. My mother was a Christian and I -- I 
shouldn™t be here. And she answered in a way 
like some body would who really felt badly about 
it. And she said, ﬁBut there™s 
nothing I can do about it.ﬂ ﬁKann 
nicht sta fur mat -- kann nicht 
daran tun.ﬂ And then she left us, asked us to -- fi
rst she asked us to stay 
together, there were six, 
we didn™t know the others. And she was flir
ting with two German soldiers who were 
accompanying the train. In the meantime we reali
zed that there was one other German woma n, 
she had lived in Prague. We never got too close w
ith her, she was much older than most of us. 
And there was another Czech woma n, Hanka, she was a communist, through and through. And I 

can say that I never felt a relati
onship with Hanka. I mean, we  all helped each other, but it wasn™t 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
101 
 
 
the same  relationship I fe lt with Buschi and 
Hannah and Zdena. And there was one woma n, 
Hannah, and we three became very close friends. And 
then one of the soldiers came  to us. In the 
meanti me  -- I must say this first, there were 
hundreds of inma tes on the railroad trestle. They 
were Hungarian workers who had worked in th
e factory, and who -- they had worked these 
wome n practically to death. They
 could hardly stand, they had 
open sores, impetigo, whatever it 
was, they were in horrible shape. And they 
had been pushed by the SS into cattle cars until the 
cattle cars were full to the brim, and then they 
locked the cattle cars. 
And our guard had stayed 
with us in the meanti me , and then had gone over 
to the soldiers, and the SS had left. Because I 
think that we  were the responsibility of that N
azi guard. And then one of the soldiers came  over 
and told us to follow him and he put us into the 
last cattle car. And we we
re the only six in this 
huge cattle car, and then he lock
ed the cattle car. And I have no 
idea any more, and I™m not sure 
even would have had an idea when we came -- wh
en we finally ended up in Merzdorf, how long 
we had been in the cattle car. Bu
t the soldiers finally opened the 
door and joined us in the cattle 
car. One was relatively young, and you know, the -- Ha
nnah thinks this guy was this old, I don™t 
reme mber. And the younger of the soldiers cried, a
nd he told his buddy that 
if his people did that 
to human be ings, he didn™t want to live any more
. And they gave us bread, they gave us cheese, 
they gave us privacy. I mean, we hadn™t seen wh
ite bread for years, and cheese. And they gave 
us privacy to use a bucket. And we sat in this hu
ge cattle car in one corner, and deciding what are 
we going to do when we return to Auschwitz. 
And the only language that Hannah, Zdena, and 
the -- and the other Czech girl, a
nd I and the -- the -- the German girl we didn™t have too much 
close relationship with, spoke, was German, because 
they were all educated people, and this -- 

most of the Czechs spoke German, and of course the Dutch do. And Buschi™s family originally 

came from Germany anyway, so I don™t remember
 whether she had some German grandparents 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
102 
 
 
or what. And Buschi and I decide d that we were going to throw each -- ourselves against the 
electric wire instead of being gassed. And th
e German soldiers heard that, you know, we spoke 
their language. And the train came to
 a standstill. I have no idea what they did while we were in 
the cattle car before the train left  Auschwitz --  le
ft  the labor camp that we had been in before. 
They must have spoken to the engineer of the tr
ain. They mus t  have coordinated it some how. But  

on the other hand, you have to r
ealize that this wa s the very
 beginning of 1945, and things 
weren™t looking too great for the Germans. So th
ey told us to jump out
 of the cattle car and 
follow them. And when we got onto the platform, 
we realized it said Me
rzdorf, it did not say 
Auschwitz. And we followed them t hrough the 
small village of Merzdorf. It™s a very 
mountainous region. It™s a beautifu
l region. It was very cold. It 
was probably the very beginning 
of January, with snow and ice on the road. A
nd here are these decrep
it looking wome n, with a 
thin shift, and wooden clogs, no hair, following 
uniformed German soldiers through the village 
of Merzdorf. And the villagers 
were comi ng out of their doors l ook -- staring after us. And we 
went through a big gate, into a work camp. It 
said, ﬁKa msta, Mettner 
and Frahne,ﬂ it was a 
factory. They ma de linens there, which we later f
ound out, from the original raw ma terial of flax. 
And they told us to wait, and then they we
nt to see the commander 
of thecamp, who was a 
woma n. The  most vulgar looking woma n I™ve ever s
een in my life, Anna Rinke. She mi ght only 
have weighed 300 pounds, I reme mb er her weighing 400 pounds. She was tall and big. She was 

bursting out of her Nazi uniform. 
And she stood in front of these soldiers, quite a ways from us. 
We were on one side of this very big area, with
in the factory buildings 
-- yard, and -- and they 
had to get into her pl ace on the other side. And 
all I reme mber her comi ng out and screaming at 
them, ﬁI don™t want them here, ge
t them out of he re, send them 
back to Auschwitz. That™s it.ﬂ 
And they stood in front of her, they gave the Nazi
 salute, they clicke d thei r heels, they left  us

there, they never looked back. So, with all my 
hatred for Germans, we owe our lives to these 
soldiers. And not a letter or a 
telephone call for many years, whether it was from Hanna h, or 
Zdena, or Buschi, without questioning if we 
only would know the name s  or where these people 
are, they saved our lives, I™m sure at a consider
able ri sk to themselves
. But again, they probably 
couldn™t have taken that risk if we would 
have come there mu ch
 earlier than we did. 
Q: So she let you in? 

A: She had no choice. 

Q: She had no choice because you were standing there. 

A: The train was gone, we had no choice, I guess. 

Q: I want to ask you two sort 
of si -- simple questions. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Ho -- how did you know it was Mengele in Auschwitz? 

A: I was told that in the camp by some  of the 
people who had been in the camp longer than we 
were, and especially by the Hungarian girl. And th
ey described him to me, and I remember him. 
I certainly wouldn™t have recognized
 his features. I don™t think I w
ould have had the guts to look 
in his face. 

Q: Right. 

A: And I only later learned that there were othe
r physicians or SS who we re selecting. But I was 
told, and I took this, that they 
knew what they were talking about
, that these transports were 
selected by Mengele. And I was told then, for the 
first time, that -- by is
 -- people, you know, in 
the camp, who had been in Auschwitz much longer
, that they were doing 
experime nts on people, 
which also didn™t penetrate my he -- my brain. I 
mean, I -- I didn™t know what they were talking 
about. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488

Q: The other question is, how in heaven™s 
name  were you able to keep your glasses? 
A: Well, that I don™t know. You tell me. 
Q: We ll, I don™t know. 

A: I don™t know. I had a pair of gl
asses, they had a pearl ma tte frame, and I had them when I left 
Düsseldorf. I was very careful with my glasses 
because my vision was very poor since my birth. 
And I can™t comprehend it, because here I™m in
 this country with wonderful technology, and it 
wasn™t too long ago, with a different pair of gl
asses than these that 
I was accompanying a friend 
to the hospital and the lens fell out on the floor
. And these glasses lasted. I think they were 
thicker glasses in those days, the frames were th
icker, I don™t know. I was very careful with them 
because they were part of my 
life. I can™t see without glasses. When I was in Terezín, I had a 
special place for them on my bunkbed, and the 
girls would never go into my bunkbed, that was 
my bunkbed. When I was in Auschwitz, I didn™t take 
them off at all, ever. When I came into the 
next camp, where I™ve me t Buschi and Zdena, I al
so kept them on the bunkbed, or on my nose. 
And the same in Merzdorf. And believe me , I was  
really frightened that some thing could happen 
to them. But I wasn™t beaten up ever, which woul
d have caused them to be thrown on the floor, 
so they somehow survived. 

Q: I was actually more curious in Auschw
itz, even though you weren™t tattooed, you were 
shaved, and you went through the sauna. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: So did you hold them in your hand?  Did you hide them from people? 

A: That I don™t reme mbe r . 

Q: Because they took things away from everybody. 

A: Yeah, but they -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
105 
 
 
Q: They didn™t touch you? 
A: I -- I kept my glasses. 

Q: It™s interesting. 

A: They mu st have been on my nose, because if 
I had them -- I don™t recall putting them in my -- 
but the sa me  thing with Zdena. Zdena came from the 
sa -- it was a ta -- sa
me  transport as I, and 
Zdena wore glasses, and they didn
™t take her glasses either. They took the glasses, of course, of 
people who were gassed. So, whether they took gl
asses routinely of peopl
e they were sending to 
work, would it ma ke sense to take glasses away
 from people you want to work -- for -- who -- 
who have to work for you?  I don™t know. But of
 our six, Zdena and I were the only ones who 
wore glasses, I think. Hannah doesn™t wear glasse
s. So while the others were -- he probably 
didn™t like them. One of them was pretty short.
 I don™t know. It™s -- it™s 
-- it™s, you know -- I 
have -- 

Q: It™s a my stery. 
A: It™s a my stery. It™s -- it™s 
-- it™s an absolute my stery. 
Q: Right, right. 
A: No, I have no clue. And I was very -- I was ve
ry much aware of the necessity of guarding my 
glasses, yeah. 

Q: Okay, we have to change the tape.

Q: Ursula, I™ll go back to Ursula. 
A: Yeah? 

Q: Your friends, Hannah, Buschi, Hanka, Zdena -- 

A: Zdena. 

Q: Zdena. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Sorry. And Hilde. 

A: We ll, Hilde is Buschi. 

Q: Hilde is Buschi. Oh, okay. 

A: Right, that was her nickname . 

Q: Okay. Did you meet in Auschwitz? 

A: Yes, we me t in that wo me n™s camp, which was 
mostly all -- not all of 
them, onl y Buschi and -
- and Zdena and I, and then we me t the other 
ones when we were round -- when we were 
rounded up in Kudowa, and we were rejects. 

Q: Uh-huh. Yes. 

A: But only -- only Zdena and -- 
and Buschi and I me t in Auschwitz. And Hannah and -- and the 
others two, we me t when
 we are all rejected. 
Q: Right. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: And wha t  was it about all of
 you that you think brought you toge
ther and allowed you to be so 
good for each other?  Do you have any idea?   

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
107 
 
 
A: We ll, I think that Hanka, who -- just to diffe
rentiate her from Hannah, she was Czech, and sh 
-- I™m sure she was a communist. I mean, we all 
knew she was a communist. I -- I had nothing to 
do with her -- with her communis m
, but her whole manner and all th
is, I™m not sure that if it 
would just -- just been Hanka, that we would ha
ve become  very good friends, okay?  But we were 
the six who were selected to be sent back to 
Auschwitz. And so we really stuck together. My 
closest friends were Buschi and Zdena and Hannah.  
Q: So ha -- 

A: And the other two, Hanka and I forget the 
other name, the -- the other German woman, she 
had lived in Prague for awhile, she wa s consider
ably older, and I was the youngest of the whole 
group. They called me  das Kind. And Hannah, when they used to call home , and Hans would 

talk to -- they would never talk to each other th
at how is Uschi, [indecipherable] macht das Kind, 

you know. The Czechs speak some  German too, but the -- my husband very seldom spoke 

German, but  it was always when they re
ferred to me  as th -- some  Kind, you know? 
Q: Right. 

A: And -- and Hannah is stil
l kidding about it, yeah. 
Q: So this was -- this became  another fa mily for you. 

A: It became a family. Zdena and Buschi and I wo
rked outdoors in transpor
t, and the other girls 
worked in the factory an
d I don™t think that we three could have
 survived without 
the girls in the 
factory, because they stole flax and -- and yarn, and we ma de warmers to put in our wooden 

clogs, on our head, and chest warmers, and I think 
that was a horrible wint
er in those mountains, 
and I don™t think we could have survived. We  su
pported each other constantly. We  more often 
found some thing in the ga rbage at the railroad st
ation because we had to unload coal cars, and 
flax cars, than they did. They had no way to
 get anything. And anything we found we would 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
108 
 
 
carry back to the camp and divide it between th
e six of us, we would 
never eat it alone. If 
some body was sick, we supported them. We  -- it was taking your life into
 your own hands if you 
-- if you even went to the so-called doctor, w
ho happened to be a -- a dentist. There were no 
me dicines anyway, and I never was sick except 
for one day when I™m sure I had a fever and I 
was ready to topple over, and Sunday were wonde
rful days in Merzdorf for Anna Rinke, she 
would torture us standing for hours and hours. It 
was very cold, and I was ready to pass out. And 
both Zdena and Buschi were much taller than I wa
s, especially Zdena wa s very tall. And sh -- 
Zdena stood in front, and Buschi in back and they
 literally supported me . Because to -- to -- in 
those -- at that time  still, if you told them you 
we re sick, I mean, there was always a da nger they 
could transport you back to an extermination camp. 
Q: Did -- could you notice, or did you notice 
that other wome n in the camp were doing 
something similar, or was -- were -- 
the working of your group was unusual? 
A: No, it was unique. 
Q: It was unique. 
A: I think we  were unique, and then we were the 
last ones to arrive in Merzdorf, and there was a 
large cons -- contingent of H
ungarian wome n there, who were 
constantly fighting which is -- 
which -- with each other, or cooking together, 
you know, i maginary cooking. And they were -- 
there was -- there were a few Ger ma ns -- German 
Jews, but the rest of them were all Poles, 
Polish Jews. And they didn™t want
 to have anything to do with 
us, especially the Polish Jews, 
who had been there much longer than any one of
 us, so any new person who arrived was just -- 
they probably felt depriving them
 of food and so -- you know, it™s -- 
it™s very hard to understand, 
we were all Jews, but we -- we were not supportive 
of each other. I hate to say this, but that™s -- 
that™s the way it was. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
109 
 
 
Q: So you saw a lot of conflict? 
A: I saw conflict, and I didn™t 
-- I did not see a group that stuck together the way we did. And 
some  of the Polish Jews who had been there fo
r a much longer time, some of them had better 
positions, some of them worked in th -- in the 
kitchens, and they knew each other, and they 
would give food to -- to othe
rs, you know, who came from similar background. But relatively 
speaking, we  were not in aush -- i-in Merzdorf 
that long. From January to liberation, which 
seemed like a lifetime, but wit
hout that friendship, you know -- a
nd I was very lucky that I was 
asked to spread salt, rock salt on the scales. Th
e s -- some  of t he stuff coming in had to be 
weighed, and the scales were all frozen, they
 weren™t working, so I was given the job of 

spreading rock salt. So I reasoned, if cattle can 
eat rock salt, why can™
t we?  And the camp had 
run out of salt for months. And that is very 
weakening whe -- when you have to work. So I 
stuffed my pockets full of rock salt, and the six of
 us lived off that rock salt until liberation. And 
we -- we dug up horse -- we f -- I found -- I don™tknow if I found, or Buschi, or one of us found 
a horseradish patch, which we dug up. And I think 
the Nazi guard probably realized we  were 
doing it. And it was comi ng towards the end of th
e war, and one of the worst guards ever, we 
called her Pigface -- and I knew there was hope one day when I was comi ng up the stairs onto 
our dormitory and the SS were a fl -- a flight
 above, and she was comi ng down the stairs, 
Pigface. She looked like a pig. She was very brutal
 and horribl e, and she ha d this porcelain di sh, 
which had sauerkraut and ma shed potatoes, th
at™s all I reme mber, there mi ght have been 
some thing else on it. She shoved that onto me , and sh
e said, ﬁFriss.ﬂ Now friss is -- is a word that 
is not used for human be ings, that shows you what
 she thought of us. You 
only talk frisson about 
pigs, about animals. There is a big distinction 
in the German language. So I was on the level of 
an animal, but at least something was in the wi
nd. Pigface was giving me  her dish with food, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
110 
 
 
I was delighted, and I carried it up 
to the dorm, and of course we all shared it. And we thought 
this was a good omen. 
Q: What was your physical condition?  Had 
you deteriorated a great deal, or -- 
A: I was very, very thin, but I 
think I was relatively healthy. I --
 I th -- I think -- I know that 
Buschi and Zdena and I were healthier than the ot
her three girls, and -- and I believe that it was 
the fresh air, and the physical work, even though we
 got very little to eat, I mean, watery soup. 
But we did find some  discarded carrots in th
e garbage, and we found some turnips in the 
garbage, and we ate grass. So that some how -- 
actually, I was stronger, and Buschi too, even 
though she was quite a bit olde r than I was, even 
than Zdena. Because after liberation, they all -- 
w-we got these six bikes from the Russian officer, 
and we were all going to bike to Prague, and 
the girls couldn™t do it. Only Buschi and I. Even 
Zdena got weak, but Buschi and I were able to 

do it. 

Q: Really? 
A: Yeah. 
Q: And that™s pretty far. 

A: Well, we separated in -- at the border, becau
se Hannah suffered a heart attack, and we had to 
leave her at the hospital. So that
 we decided, Buschi and I, that 
our plan was to go with a -- our 
Czech girls to Prague, and then take  t -- public tr
ansportation. But a Russian officer told us there 
was no transportation, nothing, a
nd his advice is everybody should go back to the country that 
they came from, to their home. Well we had no ho
me, we told him. Well, he said, ﬁWell, you 
have to go back to the country you 
came from and then try to get out
 of Europe.ﬂ And si -- that™s 
what we -- we did. We  separd -- 
sepa rated at the Czech borde r, wh
en the girls ha d to go south to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
111 
 
 
Prague and we went on, destin
ation Lippborg, which was the desi
gnation of a little village my 
aunt lived in, and my par e nts had said, ﬁIf you ge
t separated, we meet at
 Aunt Minchen™s house.ﬂ 
Q: Now, let me  just go back a little bit. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Do you reme mber the day when you™re free? 

A: Yes. 

Q: What was that like? 

A: We  were fr -- we -- we  heard a lot of commot
i on the night before of 
valises being dragged a-
around and -- and there were tr
ucks outside on the -- on the gr
ound -- the factory grounds. And 
we were, you know, we were not allowed to ope
n windows, everything was closed, the windows 
were locked, and some  of the Hungarians were 
imagining we were all going to be gassed in 
there. This is why they locked all the doors and everything. They were came  -- became very 

hysterical. And then it was the next morning, 
after our -- the SS and the guards, everybody had 
fled, that the door was opened by a German sol die
r, who appeared all alone, and said, ﬁMeine 
Da me n, sie sind frei.ﬂ ﬁMy ladies, you are free.ﬂ 
We  looked at each ot her, we™re looking for the 
ladies. And we couldn™t believe it. And we -- of
 course, we didn™t believe him. And he was a 
German, how could we believe hi
m?  And it was Maurice and his 
-- his Belgian friend, and also 
prisoner, who we had befriended, especially I 
had befriended Maurice very much, and he had 
promised me he would take me  through the meadow
s, who literally had to drag us out of there. 
And to -- 
Q: Maurice was another prisoner? 

A: He was a French prisoner, a prisoner of war.
 These were two prisoners of war. There were 
more than two, but these were the two that we ha
 -- occasionally came  in 
contact with, who kept 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
112 
 
 
our spirits up, and -- and that wonderful advice. 
If -- everybody was afraid they were going to put 
us on a forced ma rch, and don™t go on a forced ma rc
h. I never even thought of a forced ma rch till 
Maurice kept saying this. And I said, ﬁ Well, how 
can we refuse it if it™s going to be enforced 

with machine guns? ﬂ  We ll try everything, you know. But 
he said that™s going to be the death of 
you because it was, you know, pretty horribl e weather. So -- 

Q: Fortunately you didn™t go. 

A: Yeah, we didn™t. Fortunately 
they decided to -- to flee. 
Q: Right. 

A: I think the Russians were comi ng in too fast
, because the -- the German soldier opened the 

door, and the -- I think the Russians were comi ng 
in the afternoon. And the 
first Russian soldier 
was on a bicycle, believe it or not. And he -- 
you know, he was just tryi
ng to find out what was 
going on, and -- and he later identifi
ed hims elf as Jewish. But a lot of these Russian Jews, they 
weren™t very Jewish, you know, they -- but 
he said he was really born a Jew, too. 
Q: So you went back to Li
ppborg to find your mother, and 
the other relatives, yes? 
A: Right. Yes, Buschi and I -- th
e bicycle that -- bicycles that 
were given to us, we -- by the 
Russian officer, we -- we  avoided the ma in road
s, and we found a Germa n s -- a dead German 
soldier. Buschi found him. We  usually picnic 
at the side of the ro
ad, secondary roads only, 
because we were warned not to take the ma in ro
ads. And he had a ma p in his -- in his pocket, 
and that ma p got us all the way to -- I mean, got Buschi to Holland. 

Q: Really? 

A: Yeah, yeah, we followed that ma p. Had swastikas 
on it, but it follow --  it -- it really helped. It  
really helped. It was a very, ve
ry good ma p. And we -- we sh -- 
sought shelter, and we stayed 
with people, and I must say, in the Russian -- wh
at is now the Russian -- what used to be the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
113 
 
 
Russian zone, East Germany, peopl e were much nicer
 to us. I think they were scared to death. 
Most of them had fled, and they were scared to
 death of the Russians. But there was one place 
over the Mulde River where we had to cross, that was a separation line, 
the dema rcation line of 
the Russian and the American forces, and the Ru
ssians let us go over. 
Half the bridge was 
Russian, half American, the we -- Americans w
ouldn™t let us cross. A
nd we pleaded, and we 
came back, and came back, and I think it was two or three days later, Buschi finally persuaded 
them -- we -- we both spoke English, but Buschi™s 
English was better than 
mi ne at that time. And 
they told us to come  back the next morning, 
and if they are busy on 
the field telephone, we™d 
better follow their instructions. We ll,
 we got to them exactly when they said we should be there, 
and they were busy on the field telephone, and they 
said, ﬁGet the hell out of here.ﬂ And we sure 
did get the hell out of there. We  -- we bicycled 
like the devil was after us, and we were in the 
American zone. And then we -- I™ll never forget 
Dresden, never. I mean, the lamp posts were like 
straws, and the -- everything was in -- in horribl
e condition. I mean, the pi
ctures that my husband 
took of Kassel -- and of Kassel too, we came thr
ough Kassel, is exactly what we saw. And we 
just had one goal, I mean, to get to Lippborg, a
nd for Buschi to get to Holland. And I won™t go 
into any detail, you don™t have the time , but you 
know, in my  book I go into 
all these details, and 
if you want any other details, you can ask me . 

Q: Right. 

A: And I reme mber going over the 
river in Kassel, the Mulde, a
nd I really thought we wouldn™t 
ma ke it. I mean, the bridge was so bad, it wa
s so bombed out it was just horrendous, but we 
made it. And eventually, I mean after bicycli
ng for almost a month, and one incident was we 
were almost overtaken by Russian soldiers who -- who thought girls were 
a nice catch at that 
time, and the Russian officer saved us there. Bu
t when we came close to -- to Li ppborg, which is 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
114 
 
 
from where we started out from, about 500 miles by 
bicycle, in our conditi
on. We -- there is only 
one street in that village, called Dorfstrasse. A
nd it™s -- it™s pretty hill
y, and we were pushing our 
bikes up Dorfstrasse, cobblestone s Dorfstrasse. A
nd it has a very narrow sidewalk, and I saw a 
woma n who was carrying a big load of wash. Sh
e had gray hair and I recognized that woma n, 
even though I™d reme mb ered her with jet black 
hair, it was my mother. And she recognized me  
too. But she came over, and she just barely embr
aced me , she just her hand on me , but she was 
looking back. She was expecting some  others to
 follow me . She was looking for my father and 
my brother. And before she said
 anything else, she said, ﬁPapi,ﬂ 
which we called my father, ﬁand 
Bübchen are not comi ng back? ﬂ  And then she sc
reamed. ﬁMy child is back.ﬂ ﬁMein Ki nd is 
zurück!ﬂ And the villagers came out of thei
r houses, and everybody asked, because we had 
visited my a unt so many times as childre
n, you know, where™s your father and where™s your 
brother. And we stayed in lip -- I mean, Buschi
 stayed in Li ppborg for I don™t reme mber exactly, 
maybe a couple of weeks, and my gra ndmother 
and my aunts, you know, th
ey bro -- they -- first 
they got everything going, hot wa
ter, and they didn™t have, you 
know, automa tic hot water, they 
had big stoves and they were heating up the 
kettles, and -- and the big bathtub on the huge 
kitchen tile floor, and then Buschi and I were ge
tting baths with -- they were scrubbing us, and 
my grandmother was saying, ﬁWell you know, you still have to go over the neck, and they are 

still filthy over here and there.ﬂ And they discar
ded our clothes, they gave us new clothes, and 

they nursed us back to health. And they persuade
d Buschi to stay longer than he -- she had 
wanted to, and then Buschi had to go back to Amst
erda m, she had to tell her in-laws that she, the 
Jew survived, and that her husband, their only so
n, was killed by the Nazis. And Buschi and 
Hannah stayed friends for -- and I, we stayed frie
nds for life. And finally my mother and I were 
able to come  to this country 
in 1947, and I shall never forget th
at -- the er -- S.S. Ernie Pyle 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488  
115 
 
 
taking us into New York harbor, 
and that Statue of Liberty, and 
I think that most i mmi grants 
never forget that picture, you 
know. They all think like I did, sh
e™s giving a special welcome to 
us. So, it would have been nice if we could have
 come  here in ™48. We
 would have had -- our 
fa mily would have been togeth
er, but that was not to be. 
Q: You me a n ™38. 
A: In ™38, yes. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: I™m sorry. But that was not to be. And I love 
this country, it™s -- it™s 
a wonderful country, and 
I me t my husband here. 

Q: And you had two boys. 

A: And two boys. 

Q: And your mother rema rried? 

A: Yeah, a wonderful stepfather, who I must sa
y I liked, but I don™t thi
nk I appreciated him as 
much as I should have. I think I mi ssed my father 
so much that there was such a rese ntme nt that 
he didn™t survive. I mean, don™t get me wrong, we
 had a very good relationship, but some ti me s I 
feel ma ybe I could have been more loving to him. 

Q: Oh. 

A: The boys only knew one grandfather -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- that was Siegmund, who could not have be
en more wonderful if they had been his own 
grandchildren. And they loved their grandmother. So that™s my story. 

Q: We ll, there™s obviously mo
re to tell, but -- thank you 
so very much for comi ng. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0488

A: Oh, you™re welcome, it™s -- I 
think it™s -- it™s
 a -- it™s a wonderful 
thing you are doing, and -- 
and I™m very appreciative. 
Q: We ll, I know this was not easy 
to -- to do. The loss is very great. 
A: We ll, yeah, I -- some how, some times it™s harder than others. 

Q: Right. 

A: You know, I talk about it. I™m not talking abou
t it as muc h any more as I did. I can™t write 
Hans™ story and keep going out and -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- and it™s -- I do it at [indeci
pherable] Valley college. I think it
™s so important. We are busing 
in 3000 kids every year, and we can™t -- we don™
t -- ma ny, ma ny more want to come , and it™s a 
wonderful program. And we have speakers, and we
 have a discussion group with survivors, and 
righteous and liberators. And I th
ink it™s -- it™s a wonderful progr
am, but I™m not sure how much 
more I will do going to individua
l schools. It -- it does take
 a lot out of me, mm-hm.

ch, I™m very grateful that you came. 
A: You™re welcome. You™re -- you™ve been
 great, you™re a wonde
rful interviewer.

you know, television stations, etcetera, but you areunique, you™re very, ve
ry wonderful. And the 
atmosphere is just -- how can you top this? 

Q: Yes, can™t top it
. You can™t top it. 
A: You can™t top this, this is wonderful. 

Q: So thank you again.

country. Approxima tely 1925.  

Q: And this picture? 

A: (2) My mother and I. I was a very young 
child, and I don™t know exactly how old I was. 
Ursula. 

Q: And who is this good-looking gentlema n? 

A: My father, (3) Otto Lenneberg. 

Q: And wha t  year? It s 
-- it says 1935 or ™36. 
A: Yeah, it™s either 1935 or ™
36. There is no date on the picture, so this is my guess. 
Q: And this picture here. 

A: My father -- my -- excuse me, my  mother™s 
brother Konrad, my (4) 
Uncle Konrad Schneider. 
And I was a small child, and I loved him very mu ch. 

Q: And this shot, three of them?  

A: (5) My parents, and I was a baby, and that 
was taken in Dortmund, so it must have been 1926. 
Q: And this shot? 

A: This shot was taken on the roof garden of 
Karstadt. And this my (6) baby brother, who was 
born in 1930, and myself, Ursula. 

Q: And wha t  year do you think that is? 

A: ™31. 

Q: And this shot here?

A: This is (7) myself, and probably 1931, also on 
the roof garden of the Karstadt building in 
Aplerbeck. 
Q: And this shot? 

A: This is approxima tely 1936, it my -- my (8) brot
her and I and this is already in Düsseldorf. I 
think it™s the outskirts of Düsseldorf. 

Q: And you™re wearing glasses. 

A: Yes. I wore glasses since I was in kindergarten.  

Q: Okay, this shot? 

A: This is my brother, (9) Wa lter, and 
this is probably 1939 or 1940, in Düsseldorf. 
Q: And who ™ s this? 

A: This is my (10) grandmother Lenneberg, my
 father™s mother. She perished in Terezín. 
Q: And wha t  is this document?  

A: This is a (11) card written by my brother Wa
lter from Ther esienstadt. These were cards which 
prisoners were encouraged to write to give th
e impression that we were 
in a wonderful place. 
And it was supposed to go to either relatives, or
 Ge rmans, to give the impression that we were 
really living in a wonderful Jewi
sh town. So what he wrote is 
really what he was allowed to 
write. 

Q: He had a very straight penmanship as a young boy. 

A: Yeah. See, at that point, it 
was already Hauptstrasse. They ha
d changed the Q™s and -- so this 
is -- this is what, instead of
 1114  now I ha -- I reme mber, now
 it™s Hauptstrasse, it was -- 14.  
Q: And wha t  is this? 

A: This is the (12) fake mone
y that was issued in Terezín fo
r the benefit of the Red Cross 
inspection of Theresienstadt in 1944.

Q: And this picture? 
A: This mys e lf, (13) Ursula Pa
wel -- Ursula Lenneberg, sorry.
 Pr-Probably 1940, in Düsseldorf. 
Q: And this? 

A: This was a (14) blanket issued to me  in Me
rzdorf, and it had my numbe r  on it. I never had a 
tattoo, and the number was -- was embroidered on theblanket. I carried that blanket all the way 

from Merzdorf home. I still have that blanket, 
and I have cut the number out, because I used it 
for some  demonstration.  

Q: And this? 

A: This is (15) Orange, Blanche, Bleu, which is 
a Dutch flag. The roads were very insecure after 

liberation. There was still fighting going on by 
partisans, and anybody who spoke German was 
taken into custody. And my life was threatened 
after liberation. 
So my Dutch friend Buschi 
suggested that I do not speak at a
ll, that I was in shock and I lost
 my ability to speak. And -- and 
I was -- we were both Dutch, and we ma de these -- 
these flags, and put them in our clothing and 
e -- we ma de a little bigger ones and put them on our bicycles. The old ma nuscript pa -- 

Q: And this shot? 

A: That was taken in Deggendorf, in the displ
aced person camp after liberation, and as you can 

see (16) I gained quite a big of weight. I was ve
ry thin when I came out of the camps, and it took 
me , I think, a couple of years before I went back to norma l. I really blew up like a balloon after 

getting proper food. 

Q: Are those the same  glasses that ma de 
through the whole ordeal?  Your eyeglasses? 

A: Yes, those are the same glasses. I don™t thin
k I got new glasses until I eventually came  to 
Düsseldorf, and I think they were terrible. 
Yeah, they ma de it through the whole ordeal. 
Q: And this shot?

A: I believe that was taken (17) 
in either Düsseldorf or Munich, 
and it was after the war. I think 
it was 1946. I still had a pretty 
full face, but I think I was getting down to more norma l 
proportions. 
Q: And who  is this? 

A: This is my husband (18) Hans Pawel, and 
this is in 1948, when I me t him. I only knew him 
six weeks and we got ma rried. 

Q: Oh, you got ma rried after six weeks -- 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: -- not just engaged, oh. 

A: No, no engageme nt. We got ma rried after si
x weeks. And we were ma rried for almost 51 
years when he died. 

Q: And the gentlema n on the right? 

A: His father, (19) Dr. Emil Pawel. He was a phys
ician and he attended soldiers in the trenches 
of Verdun in World War 
1
, and his country gave him the Medal of Honor for that, des Eiserne 
Kreuz 1
st
 Klasse. And to top it off they then ki
lled him in Izbica, or one of the other 
extermination camps. 

Q: And this on the left? 

A: Hans™ father, my hus band™s father, (20) Dr. Emil Pawel. It™s pronounced in German Powell. 

And I believe it was 1942. 

Q: It says ™38 to [indecipherable] 

A: Oh, ™38, sorry. And what was 
the ™42, then? Oh, when he was 
killed, yeah. So, I don™t know, 
I™m guessing. I think it was -- I -- don™
t I have a question ma rk there? 
Q: Yes, you do.

A: I guess it™s ™38. 
Q: And on the right? 

A: His moth er, (21) Olga Pawel -- Pawel. Her maiden name  was Ne ma n. And she and her 

husband, they were deported together to Izbica.
