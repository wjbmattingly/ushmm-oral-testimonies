Abstract
 
Selma Engel is interviewed regarding her fam
ily and her early fa mily life in Holland.  Her 
mother, Alidy Nathans Wijnberg was born on Ap
ril 10, 1887 in Vries, Holland.  She was the 
eldest of eight children.  As a 
teenager, her mother sold textiles 
fr om the family textile store to 
far mers.  She ma rried in 1909 (? ) and became President of her Hadassah gr oup in Zwolle, 
Holland. Selma was born in Zwolle where her parent
s ran a kosher hotel af
ter their brush factory 
went bankrupt.  Selma, who enjoyed swimming, was 
the only girl, the youngest
 of four children.  
They all attended Dutch public school and Hebr
ew afternoon school.  The eldest was Braham, 
born on May 14, 1916.  Although he had a scholarship
 to go to college, he could not attend 
because he ha d to help in the hotel when it was 
just getting st arted.  Later, he went to hotel 
school and also became a dance ma ster.  He wa
s hidden during the war along with his wife and 
children.  After the war he took over the hotel, bu
t ran into problems  with the police when he 
refused to do business with any Germans.  He a
nd his family then emigrated to Toronto, Canada.  
The other brothers were Marthyn and Maur
its.  Marthyn was born on December 23, 1920, and 
played the vi olin, pi ano, saxophone, and accordi
on. He became  a fine baker after attending 
culinary school, and at 18, worked as a headma ster
 at a fine pa stry pl ace in Rotterdam.  He was a 
sergeant in the military and ten days after the war 
began, he returned to Zwolle and hid.  He and 

Selma helped the mother in the hotel.  Maur
its was born in De Leek on January 10, 1918, four 

years before Selma.  He was very sick with 
me ningitis when he was 12.  After high sc hool, he 
attended textile school to lear
n the business.  He enjoyed i
ce skating, and took Selma to the 
movies and dancing.   Around age 21 or 22, he 
ma rried a Jewish woma n, Bep Jakobs, during the 
war, and first they were hidden and then later se
nt to Poland.  Their fath
er died in 1941, and a 
ma id cared for Selma because her mother was busy with the hotel.  The fa mily was kosher and 

observant, although very assimilate
d.  The brothers played cards on the Sabbath when the parents 
were out.   In 1942, the Germans threw the fami l y 
out of their hotel and pl aced them in a small 
house with no electricity or bathroom.  Selma hi
d; she said goodbye to her mother and brothers 
in July 1942, and never saw them aga i n. She was sent to Sobibor the following year when her 
mother was sent to Poland.  Selma s a id that he
r brothers, Maurits and 
Marthyn, were sent to a 
work camp, like ﬁall the Jews in Holland.ﬂ She said 
that almost all of the Jews who had lived in 
northern Holland, were killed. Most 
of the survivors went to Israel
, and a few went to America. 
Selma mentioned that all small towns in Holland 
have me mor i als to the Jews who were killed 
during the war.
 
Selma also tells how at the beginning of the wa
r and in 1945 their hotel was used as a place to 
hide German Jews who were smuggled to Belgium.

SIDE A
 

It™s Friday, February 28
th
 and we  are speaking wi th Selma Engel in Branford, Connecticut 
about her mother, Alidy Nathans Wijnberg.  Mrs. 
Engel, could you tell us a little bit about 
your mother, her date of birth, wh ere she was born?
 
Her date of birth was 1887, April 10 and she was 
born in Holland; in a very small town.  Not 
many Jews lived, and I reme mber that my mother told me ther e was a lot of anti-Semitism.  It 
was in Vries in Drenthe in Holland.  My mother 
come  from a  fa mily from eight children.  She 
was the oldest; and they had a st
ore, a textile store.  I reme mb
er we were once in Holland, and 
some body s howed us this store.  My mother went
 to the farmers on a bicycle; and she had the 
suitcases in the front of the bicycle; and she went 
selling textiles, as she ha
d to do a lot of helping 
for the whole fa mily.
 
This was when she was  a teenager?
 
Yeah.
 
Or younger?
 
No, it was a teenager, I think; th
at I don™t know exactly, I think lik
e a teenager.  My mother got 
ma rried very late in life.  I think they got shad
chaned (ph?  c. 14).  In that time they put people 
together, ma n and wife.  I think my mother
 was not young, and my father was also not young 
when they got ma rried.  So –
 
Do you know much about her education?
 
No, I don™t.  She was a very intelligent woma n.  
She read a lot, and she was president in my 
home  Š in Zwolle, in Holland.  My parents ha
d their own hotel and she wa s president from 
Hadassah.
 
Okay, could you tell me once again th
e name of that organi zation?
 
It was Practice (ph?  c. 20) Pale
stine Work.  It was some thing from Jews in Holland; had worked 
for Israel.  It was not Israel in that time, it wa
s Palestine.  My mother was president fr om the 
group,  and I reme mber she had to make a speech 
and worked together with my brother on it.  
They were very active in a Jewish Š a Jewish temple in my hometown, in Zwolle.
 
Do you know of anythi ng else about her childhood, or her youth, or the year that she got 

married?
 
No, I don™t know much about it.  
Some how, I put that really out
 of my mind.  No, I don™t know.
 
Maybe we  should move up to Zwolle.  
This is where she and your father settled?
 
No.  My father and mother had a brush factor
y in Groningen; that™s not far from where my 
mother lived.  In 1929, the difficult time, they we nt
 bankrupt.  So they had to do some thing else; 
and they bought a hotel, a kosher hotel, in Zwolle, 
that™s another state, Overijssel.  That was the 
only kosher hotel.  My fa ther and mother worked th
at ‚til they went Š my father died in 1941Š 
until they went to the concentra
tion camp.  My mother was very active in Drenthe (? c. 34) when 
she lived there.
 

Why don™t you tell us a little about your fa
mily?  When did your mother start having 
children, and how many children di d she have?
 
We Š I don™t remember  when my mother had 
children.  I was the youngest from the four 
children and the only girl.  I had two, three older 
brothers; one was two years older, one was four 
years older, and one was six years older.  The 
one what was six years older was Braham, and he 
was hidden in the war; and he got out of it.  He 
had hims elf four children
, and he came alive out 
of the war with his wife and th
e four children.  I had two othe
r brothers, one was name d Marthyn 
(Marthijn), we have a picture of him;  and 
one was name d Ma urits.  What you want to know 
more?   We  had a very nice family.  We went bicy
cle riding a lot, and we fought a lot.  We  lived 
Š my parents had a hotel on a ca
ttle market, and it came a lot of Jewish salesmen; they slept 
overnight in our hotel.  It was very Jewish orie
nted; still, we didn™t wear payos (peyes, peyess, 
peyos, payas) or stuff like that.  We  were religio
us, but very assimilated;
 and religious.  My 
mother, when my brothers were young, they had to 
lay tefillin and all these things.  Still, it was 
very different than in Poland; and much more assi
milated.  I had a lot of 
not Jewish girlfriends; I 
stayed overnight there.  I reme mber I had to take
 my own sandwich with me  when I went there, 
but we had a lot of non-Jewish people.  And also
 when we we re always
 Š prayers on Shabbat, 
after dinner, that we always did 
that.  Not the outside world; it 
was always private, things like 
that.  My brothers Š one brothe
r went to college.  We  had a Š.
 
If you don™t mind, I™d just like 
to go back a little.  Maybe you 
could tell us a little bit about 
your mother as a person, what was  she like?
 
My mother was a very nice person; she was alwa
ys very happy, and she was singing a lot.  I 
don™t reme mber everything exactly; some how, 
I don™t remember much when I was young.  I 
very completely Š I don™t know
; I try to block it out perh
aps, I don™t know, but I don™t 
r e me mb e r .   I  r e me mb e r  t h a t  my  mo t h e r  w a s  v e r y  
religious, and she prayed in the morning and in 
the afternoon; especially when difficult time s.
  We had to go every Friday evening, every 
Shabbos mo rning we had to go the temple.  The n we came home, and we had, you know, nice 
things, lunch together, very fres
h (?) cholent (c. 65) together.  
Also Friday evening there was a 
very big thing always with Kabbalat Shabbat.  
Also in the evening the ma king the end of the 
Shabbat; it was very religious.  And also with Pa
ssover, everything is changed.  We  had a hotel, 

so there was a lot of work; all the gl asswork ha
d to be kosher-ma de.  My mother was a very 
religious person; my father was not, but my mother
 was very religious.  And the hotel was also a 
kosher hotel, strict kosher.  Many times there was 
the old rabbi standing in
 the hotel when there 
was dinners, from the kosher thing.          (c
. 71).  My mother was a very nice person, and very 
pleasant.  What it was, they were alwa ys very busy in the business, in th
e hotel.  Because in the 
evening there were so many salesmen stayed overn
ight; so I was never allowed to come  in the 
room, the hall where they was sitting, most of the time.  So the ma id brought me  to bed; I™m 

really brought up by the maid, I think, because I 
don™t remember much t hat my mother went to 

me  and kissed me  good- night or some thing like 
that.  I don™t know; in Holland, they are much 
colder, I think, the people.  They didn™t kiss so 
much, and they didn™t show so much the affection 
to each ot her.  I reme mb er when I once lay on my
 mother™s shoulder that my brother said, don™t 
do so childish or so.  You know, the people in Holla
nd were not too affectiona
te.  That is really 

what she was Š a very strong, capable person.  Of 
course, it was the religi
on, I think, that helped 
her a lot; because my fat her 
died in 1941, and she had the 
whole load on her shoulders by 
herself.  In the beginning of 1942, she had to go
 out of the hotel, and she was a very strong 
person; much stronger than I am, I think, very 
strong, very business-lik
e, very intelligent.
 
Do you remember any particular  
times that you spent together?  Any particular trip that 
you took or anything like that?
 
My father and mother never took vacations.  They
 went Š they only worked.  I reme mber they 
went when there was some thing from the Queen, in 
The Hague (?  c. 88).  Then they took a taxi, 
and they went to The Hague and saw the Queen 
and the King; not the king, the prince.  The 
Queen, they saw her, and that was for her the bigg
est thing.  I don™t remember that my father and 
mother ever went on vacation, never.  They 
always worked; that was the system.  I don™t 
reme mber that they took vacations, no.  I don™
t reme mber Š we went on ShabbatŠon Shabbos 
we went, walked.  For hours, we walked; my moth
er and my fa ther and I.  My brothers never 
went; my brothers stayed always home  with frie
nds and played cards.  But my mother, when my 
mother came in, there wa s not allowe d on Shabbat.  I reme mber that I had to walk with them.  
They came together a lot with fr iends; was very 
nice Jewish kehillah, community, very nice.  A 
lot of things going on always in 
the hotel, Je wish.  There was a Je
wish organizati
on and kept the 
clubs in our hotel, and we  had some thing to do. 
 And then we went to Sunday school, and there 
was parties always from Sunday school.  Therewas a very large community, Jewish community, 
and very active.
 
That™s nice.
 
Yeah, it was really very nice.  I had a very ni
ce youth, very nice.  I went to camp when I was 
young, Zionist camp, and there was la
nds en trein veer (ph? c.102)
 came together with all the 
youth from Holland.  I know a lot of 
people; I had a lot of Jewish fr
iends also in other towns.  I 
went to visit other people in other towns.  It wa
s very nice.  When my father and mother worked 

very hard, yeah; we had it perhaps, easier.
 
Is there any way that we can get a little bit 
closer type to the period between 1940 and 1944 
that you know what happened to your mother
?  Is there anything that you might know, 
maybe you could tell me?
 
What it has to do with the war?
 
Yes.
 
My motherŠin 1942 the Germans came and told my mo
ther that she has to go out of the hotel.  
They put her in a very small house; very poor neighborhood.
 
This was in Zwolle?
 
Everything was Zwolle.  Z-o-w-l-l-e.
 
Z- w- o .
 

Oh, yeah, yeah.  I told you that we were on
ce picked up and sentŠ.  She was a very strong 
person.  Also, I don™t know, she neve
r showed really her fear for a
nything.  I reme mbe r  that she 
was always knitting; she knitted everything for 
me.  She was always knitting; she knit whole 
suits and socks and stockings and sweaters.  Sh
e was always knitting in
 that poor house, that 
little house where we lived.  There was no el
ectricity; there was no bathroom; there was Š 
barrel, came once a week to empty it; was no shower
 there.  I thought it 
was horrible.  I didn™t 
want to stay there; I di dn™t stay there much.
 
How long were you there?
 
That was in 1942.  So I went in 1943; I went aw
ay from home and was hidden in another pl ace.  
My mother stayed there ‚til 1943
; in 1943, they sent her away.
 
You don™t kno w what month that was?
 
I don™t know; I never wa nted to know.
 
We have a correction.  We were going
 to go back, and it was still in 1942Š.
 
1942.  Because in 1943, I went already to Sobibor.
  In 1942, I was hidden.  And my mother in 
the time  that I was hidden, some body told me , th
at on the way out, that she was planning to go 
and hide some where.  The police came , and I think 
that perhaps the Gestapo; and they picked her 
up and sent her to Poland.  So th
at™s all that I know about my moth
er.  My brothers are living; I 
never exactly found out.  I really never wanted to
 know.  Lately, now we talk more about it, I 
think I should find out; I really don™t want to 
know.  Because I don™t want to know if they 
suffered a lot, and when I know what camp they
 went, it suffered more; and I hope that they 
went to a camp like Sobibor that they went righ
t away to the ga s chamber.  So I really never 
wanted to know exactly because it doesn™t make 
me  happier; doesn™t fulfill my life when I know.
 
Well, thank you very much.  Maybe we  should 
move on now to talk about your brothers.  
I™m sorry this is a difficult topic but thank 
you.  Okay, we ™re now talking wi th Mrs. Engel 
about her brother, ..
 
Marthyn.
 
Marthyn Wijnberg.  Mrs. Engel what can you 
tell us about your brother?  When was he 
born?
 
He was born in Decembe r 23, 1920.  He was two years olde r than I am.  I reme mber that we 
went every Sunday bicycle riding; 
before breakfa st we went to 
a little town.  We  drove 20, 30 
miles every Sunday morning, and then we came back
 for breakfast.  We  were always singing, the 
bathroom was downstairs and his was upstairs, andwe were always singing.  He could sing very 

beautiful; he was very musical in
clined.  We  got along very well.  We  ha d a veryŠ.  I reme mber 
when we we re young.  We wereŠwe had a very nice 
time  together.  We  were already teenagers; 
that™s the time  I can reme mber the most.
 
What type of schools di d he attend?
 

He went high school; he went to a culinary schoo
l too.  He was a very good, exceptional fine 
bakery, but the same  bakery what they do in Holla
nd.  In Holland they have very fine pastry, and 
he was very, very good in it.  He could ma ke a 
Š I reme mb er he ma de once a very large bridge 
from sugar, you know.  Yeah, very large; and it wa
s in our hotel in one of the cabinets; and it 
was dancing evening, and the thing broke.  Very fine
 ma ke; he really could paint from ma rzipan.  
In Holland this is very big, the pastry business; 
and he was very good at it.  Also he could play 
music; any instrume nt.  He could play the pi
ano and saxophone and accordion.  We  ha d always a 
lot of fun with him.  Tha t  he didŠ.  You know, 
one brother played the 
piano, and he played on 
the accordion or the vi olin.  It was ve ry nice. 
 We had a very niceŠ.  We  wentŠI wentŠhe was 

very young already and went out of the house.
 
About what  age?
 
I think he was 17, 18.  So I don™t reme mber so much
 what we did together.  He went also to 
school away from home, so I don™t reme mber
 so much that I went out with him.
 
Can we  just back up for a minute?  Can you 
tell me what type of schoolsŠwere these 
Dutch public schools?
 
Oh, yeah, Dutch public schools.  After school, every day, we went to a Hebrew school; I hated it.  

When we wentŠwe had to go every day af
ter school; we went to Hebrew school.
 
Oh, every day?
 
Every day; not a Friday, but every other day we
 had to go.  I don™t reme mber Sunday, but I know 
after school we had to go there.
 
Did you learn Hebrew there?
 
Yeah, we learned Hebrew there, an
d we learned history.  We  got Je
wish education in this school, 
oh yeah.
 
These were Zi onistly inclined schools?
 
No, that was not Zionistly inclined.  Was a 
Zionist organization in my home  town, a youth 
organization; and I was really the only one of a
ll the kids, from the four kids, that was very 

active in it.  Went to a Zionist camp i n the 
summe r , and we went bicycle riding and me t other 

groups to other little towns.  There was all litt
le towns; all over lived Jews. A lot of Jewish 
people lived in the whole area outsideŠvery small 
towns.   In every small town was a synagogue 
in Holland.  Then we came together always, ever
y other Sunday, and it was very active always 
with the–
 
But Marthyn was not as involved asŠ  
 
No, he was not so much involve
d in that some how.  The other brothers we re not so much 
involved.  Maurits was more i nvolved, but Marthyn was not involve
d, and my oldest brother was 

not so much involved.
 
Did he go outŠwas he in any bands or anything if he was so musical?
 

No, there was no such a – I don™t reme mber that 
really.  He was away; he went to school, and 
he had to make a living.  I don™t remember that.  
I really don™t reme mber 
that; that he was in a 
band.
 
When he left the house, you said as a late 
teenager, is that when he we nt to go to the 
culinary school?
 
Yes, he went to the culinary school.  Then 
he went, when he was 18, he went working in 
Rotterdam; he was in a very fine place.  He 
was the headma ster already from that place for 
pastry.   Big business was that.  He wa s a very charmi ng guy.
 
He had a lot of friends growing up?
 
I don™t know.  Yeah, he had friends; he lived still
.  Friends what he had, I know.  He had very 
close friends, and he lived still in Holland.  Wh
en we were at Maten (? c. 195) Holland, I me t 
this friend, and he told me  about him.  They were
 very close friends.  Th
is friend is very, very 
religious, now in Holland.  He doesn™t take th
e telephone; he  teaches Sunday school; he has the 
synagogue; he™s the president from the synagogu
e.  So we come  fr
om a very religious 
background, very religious.  I ne
ver had anything that was not kosher, you know.  First thing I 
had not kosher was in concentration camp.  Perhaps in jail or some what– 
 
So do you kno w what happened to Marthyn afterŠ? 
 
Not exactly, I don™t exactlyŠwhat wa s going on.  
I really don™tŠI never want to find out 
exactlyŠthat was my whole system r
eally.  That I never want to go –
 
All right.  So basically after he had left home 
and gone to the culinary institute, did he come 
back to Zw olle?
 
Yeah, he came  back in the war; he came  back to Zwolle.
 
About what  year was that?
 
He was in the military.
 
He was?
 
He was in the military, and he was a sergeant in 
the military.  He was in the war too.  He fought 
in the war.
 
In World War II?
 
Yeah, in Wo rld Wa r II.  Well, only ten days; the 
war was only ten days.  But he was in the war, 
and he was in the military fr om the beginning of the warŠalready before the war, he was a 

military.
 
He had been conscripted?  There was a draft?
 
Yeah, there was a draft, yeah.  He was in the–
 
Then he came back to the family (? c. 214).
 

Yeah, he came  back to the family after the war. 
 He came ba ck to his family, and then we had to 
go out of the hotel.  Then he stayed also in theŠhe
 slept in the hotelŠin that
 little house.   But I 
don™t reme mber so mu ch in daytime.  He was alwa
ys out with friends; that™s what I reme mber.  
At  that time, we didn™t have so much contact 
with him.  Whe n I went away from home , in 1942 
already, I wa s away.  It was already in July, 194
2, I say goodbye to my brothers and my mother; 
I never saw them again.  That was the last time I saw.  After the war, I was so occupied with my 

own life, I think, that I didn™t want to know exactly what.
 
When you say that he was out wi t h friends, was 
it dangerous for people, for Jews to be out 
or Š?
 
No, not in daytime.  It was dangerous ever, a
nd I think, perhaps, he stayed overnight.  I don™t 
reme mber much, I really don™t remember.
 
For example, could you go in the street and buy 
groceries and things like that?  Or I mean 
there probably weren™t too many groceri
es at a certai n point, butŠ?    
 
I don™t remember.
 
You don™t remember.
 
I thinkŠof course we had groceries in the hous
e.  In daytime we were allowed to go out.
 
But you had to we ar the star?
 
I had to wear a star, yeah.  I had to wear a star.
 
So basically once you had gone to go into 
hiding, you didn™t see your brother again.
 
No, I never saw him aga i n.
 
You™re not sure of his fate?  You kno w he was  somehow heŠ?
 
What it was–  I think he  was hidden, I reme mb er.  He was not home; because in 1941, there 

came in man to our hotel.  He say when you give 
me money, I will help that your brothers will 
get them to Switzerland.  So I give him all th
e money; he was a traito
r, that guy, and I didn™t 
know.  He was a very charmi ng ma n.  He came to  our hotel and give lo
ts of money, lots of 
money.  And he didn™t do anything.  So they we
re hidden; he was hidden.  He was not home ; 
anyway, he was not home.  I don™t know much; he
 was not home .  He wa s hidden perhaps in the 
war; he was not home.  I don™t reme mber much, 
it™s strange.  I just pu
t it klun (ph?  c.243) 
completely out of my mind, all these 
things.  I should go and be hypnotized.
 
Maybe youŠ.
 
Who cares?   He™s gone.  They™re dead.
 
Well, I thinkŠ.
 

They™re dead, and my ki ds never ask about it; 
and then they never want to know about it.  
Nobody wa nts to know about it.  I know that he 
was sent to Poland; but
 what it was; now I 
reme mber.  This brother had to go to a work camp.
 
What was his name?
 
Maurits; he had to go to a work camp, work cam
p.  All the Jews in Holland Š had to go, were 
ma de Šthey had to go to a work camp; weekends, some ti mes home.  And he say when he goes 

to a work camp, I go too; when I can help hi
m.  So he went free over to the work camp. 
 
Marthyn joined your other brother?
 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, to the work camp.
 
But they we re not incarcerated there? 
 They didn™t have to sleep there?
 
Oh, yeah, they had to sleep there.  They went away for the whole week, and on weekends 

someti mes they came home from the beginning.  
Weekends they came home .  So the Germans 
did as soon as the people went home –
 
Okay, we  had a brief interruption, but we  
we re just finishing up about what you were 
telling me about Marthyn.
 
Marthyn.  Just  Marthyn.
 
Yes.
 
It™s not written here.
 
Well, it must be someŠwe™re looking at the pi
cture.  And there, a picture of Marthyn and 
his friend with–
 
Yeah, but you don™t want to ma ke a picture from th
is star, with a Jewish
 star.  It was very 
important to them that they have a picture.  Th
ey went to a real photog
rapher and had a picture 
made fr om Jewish star ; so idiot.  Ye
ah, joke.  You see how they can joke–
 
Yes, yes.  OK.  Well, thank you very much forthis information, and we  can move on now to 

talk about one of your other brothers.
 
Yeah.
 
Okay, we ™re talking wi th Selma Engel about 
her brother Maurits, Maurits Wijnberg.
 
He was a very nice guy, a very soft-spoken nice b
oy.  He went always skating, and he was once 
very sick.  When he was twel
ve years old, he had me ningitis.
 
Meningitis, oh my.
 
Yeah.  He was very , very sick.  I reme mber that
 my father and mother pu
t hay on the street that 
the cars didn™t ma ke too much noise in the hotel, 
in another hotel.  When my father and mother 
build it later, this new hotel in Zwolle, not new 
any more, of course.  He was very, very sick.  I 

think he came out very well because he went to
 high school.  He had studied very hard, much 
harder after the sickness, I think. 
 He went to high school, and he 
helped a lot in the hotel.  He 
went to a textile school and learne
d for business; he was in business.
 
Can we  bac k  up for one second?
 
Yeah.
 
Can you tell me his date of birth and where he was born?
 
He was born in De Leek next to Groningen.  
He was born in January 10, I think, 1918.  He was 
four years older than I am.  He was very active 
also in the Zionist orga
nization.  He was the only 
one from the boys that was active, active in the Zi
onist organization together
 with me .  We  went 
always there together.  He went out a lot with 
not Jewish girls, I reme mber.  My father and 
mother were very upset about it Š when he was young.  
 
Even though he was in the Zi onistŠ?
 
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He had a lot of not Jewish girl
s.  He went skating with them, and he took me  
out always to the movies.  When we were danc
ing, organizations, he took me  out dancing.  No, 
he was a veryŠhe was very young alreadyŠhad later 
on not Jewish, Jewish 
girlfriend.  That™s 
the girl that he ma rried to.  He got married in
 the war, so he was very young.  He got married 
when he was 21; 21, 22.  He got also ma rried to a 
not Jewish Š to a Jewish 
girl, a Jewish girl.  I 
have a picture from her, too.  He was hidden.  
I don™t reme mber much what we did when we 
were children.  I don™t reme mber mu ch.  I reme mber
 that he had a lot ofŠwe had a lot of Jewish 
friends; and Shabbos when my father and mother 
were not home , they played cards.  When my 
father and mother was there, they were not allo
we d to play cards on Shabbat.   When they came 
home , they put the cards quickly under the table so
 my mother wouldn™t see 
it; that  I reme mber.  
But I don™t reme mber much about him at all. 
 I don™t reme mber much, I don™tŠit some how–
 
You were telling me that  he hadn™t studied
 tech, he we nt to a business school?
 
Yeah, he went to a specialŠHa
ndelsschool (ph, c. 303), that was 
in Holland.  He went to that 
school.
 
Where was it located?
 
In Zwolle, in my home town.  Later he went to 
a business school, that I reme mber; he went to a 
business school.  I reme mber that he was very yo
ung already.  He was 17, 18; he went with this 
Jewish girl later on ŠBep Davidson, Beppie (Betje
) Davidson, Davidson.   [Note: last name  was 
more likely Jakobs; her sister
 ma rried Dolf Davidson].
 
Do you know how to spell that?
 
Davidson.
 
Oh, no, no.  The first name?
 
Bep.  B-e-p.   SheŠthey went very young alread
y together.  Then they broke up; they went 
together again; finally they got ma rried Šin th
e war they got ma rried.  I reme mber he wasŠyou 

were not allowed from t he Germans to exchange 
your address, so he went
 at 11 o™clock, dark on 
the side of the houses, he went to her house.  He
 was sure that in the mor ning beforeŠvery early 
in the morningŠit was very dangerous what he 
didŠhe came back to the house again.  So, but 
he was a lot with my mother and also his wife.  
They were a lot in my 
mot her™s littleŠthat house 
after the war.  He helped a lot my mot her also
 when my father died in 1940; he helped my 
mother a lot in the hotel.  My 
oldest brother was ma rried already, 
and he was not home anymore.   
So he helped my mother a lot.  He and I, I don™
t reme mber, he and I went very early over in the 
morning and ma de coffee for the people that came to
 the hotel.  We made 
breakfast together for 
the people in the hotel.  Yeah, th
at I forgot.  ButŠhe was a very
 big help for my mo ther, much 
more than I am; I reme mber.  But he was a big he
lp, and he helped my mot her a lot.  He was 
hidden.
 
When did he leave the little house to go into hiding?
 
He wasŠwhen we lived in the lit
tle house, he was hidden.  Then th
ey told my sister-in-law, he 
was ma rried already then; that when some body i n th
e family was hiding, that her father had to go 
to Poland right away or had to go to camp.  So 
he came out of the hiding place because his wife, 
that was his wife already, told him to get out of 
this hiding place.  Then 
I went already very early 
out of the house, it was in July, 1942; I went away so I don™t know exactly what was going on 
then.  I didn™t have any contac
t with them; only that I know that
 they were all sent to Poland.
 
Who told his wi fe this, that they wo uld beŠ?
 
I don™t know; it was just a rumor, what goes aro
und.  The Jewish (Joodse, Joodsche) Raad; there 
was a Jewish group of Jewish people what helped
 the Germans really to organize everything.  

That was very active in Holla
nd, I think.  So anyway, some how
 there was Š and he was Š 
that™s the way he went out of the hiding place, and he went together with
 her.  I think Š I don™t 
know together with her; I don™t 
know how they went over to Po
land; I don™t know.   I never 
found out anything.
 
That was in ™42?
 
That was in ™42, yeah, 1942.  Very surely in 
the area where we lived; much more than in 
Amsterdam.   In Amsterdam, was the underground
 much quicker and was already going on in 
there.  The Jews wereŠour life much more from
 Amsterdam area.  But the Jews lived northern 
Holland where I come  from, they all got killed; 
almost nobody left.  The few what are left, they 
live in Israel.   There™s a lot of
 Dutch, not a lot; there ar e Dutch Jews what are alive, they all 
went away to Israel.  The most other to Ameri
ca, but not ma ny to America; the most went to 
Israel.  TheyŠbut I know that all little 
towns where you go now in Holland, you see all 
me morials in every little town.  
In every little town there was a Jewish community; they all had 
synagogues there.  In all these little towns wh
ere I come from, from northern Holland Š from 
Overijssel, Drenthe, Groningen Š all province 
like Connecticut; there™s nothing left.  In 
Friesland there™s nothing left. They all got killed in ear
ly ™42; a lot got caught too.
 

Can we  try to shift back a little?  You sa
id your brother was veryŠdo you know of his 
other interests?  You said he was very soft-s
poken and nice.  Did he have any hobbies like 
your other brother, orŠ?
 
He wasŠno, I don™t remember.  I reme mber he was 
active in the Jewish organization, also in the 
Zionist organization.  I reme mber that the war br
oke out in 1940; that 
he was there, and he 
helped my mother a lot in the ho
tel in that time.  He was alrea
dy very young with this Bep; was 
very young, they went together.  So
 they went ice-skating together
, and that™s what I reme mber.  
I don™t reme mber much t hat he had hobbi
es and things like 
that, no; I don™t, no.
 
Okay, that™s fine.  So is there anything else
 you™d like to tell me about your brother 
Maurits?
 
No, that™s what I reme mber.  He went to Hande
lsschool.  He did the high 
school and went to the 
college there.
 
Handel as in the composer?  H-a-n-d-e-l.
 
Handelsschool, yes.  There was like a MULO, like 
in high school, like in high school; especially 
for business.  Yeah.  He studied always, he studi
ed always; that I reme mb er.  Then he me t this 
girl, and he was a lot over her house.  So that
™s the – And I was a lot out of the house; then 
when the war broke out, and I was not much ho
me.  When we were younger, I really don™t 
reme mber much.  I some how put th
ings out of my  me mory (?  c. 
388).  We  had a very nice life, 
like the kids here.  We went out, 
lots ski; he went always ice ska
ting.  I went swimmi ng a lot, so 
we didn™t have the same  interests.  I went ev
ery day swimmi ng, and he went more with the boys 
out.  He studied a lot; he went to
 school and studied a lot.  I 
went ice skate – , swimmi ng a lot 
and every day, so we didn™t have much –
 
If he was going ice sk ating, where were you
Šyou were swimming in the wi nter or Š?
 
In the winter, yes.  We  went the whole wi
nter through.  There wa
s a house where you could 
swim.
 
Oh an indoor, an indoorŠ?
 
An indoor swi mmi ng pool, oh yeah, an 
indoor swi mmi ng pool; not outdoors.
 
You were that Š?
 
No, no, no.  In the indoor swimmi ng 
pool in Holland; I forgot the name .  There was an outdoor 
swimming pool also in my home to
wn.  In summer I went on the bicycle; and I reme mber I had 
the bicycle; I had to bring food to the Jewish patie
nts in the hospital on the bicycle.  He went too 
a lot; he did.  We  helped my mo
ther a lot after my  father died. 
 He was a very big help in the 
hotel.  My other brother was ma rried, so
 he helped my mother in the hotel.
 
Okay, we ll that™s great.  Th
ank you very, very much.
 
 
SIDE B
 

February 6.
 
OK.  Do you know anything about his childhood 
Š what type of an education he had, what 
kind of a family?
 
No.  His father and mother had a factory in Š n
o, his father went, made brushes and made from 
rotan. (ph? c. 03) or Š see like that.
 
Oh, a rug.
 
Yeah; a rug cleaner. Yeah, he and my grandfathe
r went to the farmers 
to sell it from door by 
door.  They were very, very poor.  And later on th
ey started a little factory, and my fa ther had, 
together with his brother, a factory Š ma de brushes.  And my father traveled always to Germa ny 

on the motorcycle, and he sold the busi
ness in Germany.  Tha t ™s what I know.
 
Were they religious Jews?
 
No, they™re not religious.  No, my
 father was not comnatra (ph?  
c. 10).  Very Jewish, I think, 
when they came from a small tow
n, De Leek; very small town.  Bu
t they were not very religious; 
no, no, no.
 
Did he have brothers and sisters?
 
Yeah, he had six brothers and sisters;
 six or seven brothers and sisters.
 
Wow.  OK, so do you know anything about cl
oser to his adulthood, like how he met your 
mother?
 
I think they were brought togeth
er; marriage Š how you call that?
 
Arranged marriage.
 
Arranged marriage, yes; an arranged ma rriage.  
My mother was very orthodox and come from a 
very orthodox fa mily; and my father was not 
orthodox.  Very orthodox was my mot her Š from 
Agudah      (ph?  c. 16).
 
Really?
 
Yes, very orthodox; and my father was not ortho
dox.  I reme mber as a child, and Friday evening 
we were not allowed to put electr
icity out; and the maid was not th
ere, so my father™s hands put 
the lights out.  My father was very charmi ng ma n, he was very good-looking, he could sing very 

nice; and my mother was really the businesswoma
n.  And my father helped, cooked in the –.   
My father was also baker a short time, because in
 the hotel  he  ma de cake; he ma de special Dutch 
cake, boterkoek he ma de ; and he baked raisin brea
d, and he cooked a lot.  My father cooked a lot 
in the kitchen.  And my 
mother did was always in the front, in
 the business; and that™s really–.  
And he was very –.  I reme mber when the waite
rs in the hotel didn™t have a good day, that he 
put always some  money on the floor
; so when they clean the floor
, that they found some money.  
And he was a very generous ma n, ve ry gener
ous.  He Š I me an on Friday evening he bought 
always so much fruit Š all diffe
rent kind of things that we ha
d on Friday evening for Kabbalat 

Shabbat; we ma de very big.  What I reme mber mo
re from my father?   He was very generous 
guy; everybody liked him.
 
You said in 1929 is whe n they bought the hotel?
 
Yeah.  My father and mother lost de daad (p
h?  c.29).  In 1929 they lost everything, in the 
factory; in the brush factory wh
en everything got electric, get mechanical done, so they –.  The 
business di dn™t do well, and they sold it; and then
 the family helped of course.  And they bought 
a hotel, a kosher hotel, in Zwolle, in Holland;
 that was 1931.  And that
 hotel was on a cattle 
ma rket; but they moved t hat cattle ma rket two ye
ars later.  But they didn™t know when they 

bought the hotel, and they had to build a new hotel
 on the new cattle market; and that was also in 
Zwolle.  And Š Daddy (ph?  c.36) did very well; 
it was very hard, when they didn™t have so 
much mone y when they lost the mo ney in 1929. 
 And they had to build up the hotel; and got 
loans from the beer factories and from the banks and –.  Later on, I reme mber when I was a 

teenager, they did already very well.  
It was already out of the difficult times.
 
OK.  And you said that your father died in 1940?
 
No, my father died 
in 19 Š 41 or ™40?
 
5701
 
Yeah.  My father died when he was 55 years old.
 
So that would be Š yeah; I think it wo uld be 1940.
 
1940; OK.
 
All right; of what causes?
 
Heart attack.
 
Oh, he had a heart attack?
 
Yeah; he was very nervous with that both brothe
rs were in the army, and they were looking for 
them; and very short after that, he died in a he
art attack.  And it was good; then he™s buried in 
Holland.
 
So he hadn™t really experienced too much of the –
 
No, nothing at all; no, no, almost not
hing at all.  I don™t think so; no.
 
OK, but do you think it was part of the pre
ssure of what was going on wi th the Nazi s 
invading?
 
Possible, possible; that had some th
ing to do with the hear t at tack.
 
Was there talk of  that in your family when –?
 
Of course; when the war broke out, we did; we
 right away saw –.  We  never saw there was a 

concentration camp, gas chambers, but –.  I was a tomboy, a nd I was very young.  I was Š not 

so young Š I was 18.  I never Š talked seriously; 
they never talked with
 me when I was there 
around, like money worries, not.  And, so Š of c
ourse,  we talked about it.  When all the 
German Jews came to our hotel, and they stayed 
overnight ma ny times in the hotel; and then they 
were smuggled to Belgium.  And then when boats
 went away from there; so we had a lot of 
people always overnight when we had, were still in 
the hotel.  We get also after the war, we did a 
lot of people came over to the hotel, and they
 were smuggled out, and slept in the attic.
 
Oh really?
 
Yeah.  A lot of from the camps slept in the at
tic with us and were sm
uggled to Belgium and Š
 
Was your father involved in helping any of these, or was this afterwards?
 
I don™t reme mber, I don™t reme mber.  But that™s what
 I tell –   What™s also in the war we had a 
lot of Germa ns came to our hotel, German Jews, 
a nd stayed in the hotel overnight and when 
smuggled someplace else; in the begi nning, yeah.  
But also in 1945, that was already after the 

war, we had a lot of Jewish pe
ople that stayed in the attic th
e whole night, and we give them 
food; 50, 60 stayed in the attic, slept Š we had th
e beds on the floor. And then they were picked 
up and cycled (ph?  c. 62) in the evening, and th
ey were sent to Belg
ium;  I think like that.
 
When would that begin Š the smuggling?  
Do you know what year, approximately?
 
That was in 1945 already.
 
Oh, after –
 
Also, in the war, that was in the very beginni
ng, very beginning; yea
h, very beginning Š in 
1940.
 
1940?
 
Yeah, yeah, 1940; that we had the Jews in the hotel.
 
And you knew that this was going on?
 
Of course you knew.  The help (? c. 67) was 
not allowed to talk a
bout it with anybody; and 
nobody came to the hotel and things 
like that.  But it was very short time  that could have done.
 
Right. OK.  Well, is there 
anything else you™d like to
 tell me about wh at you can 
remember?  About your father?
 
No.
 
No?  That should do it.
 
Yeah, that should do it.
 
OK; all right.  Thank you very much.
 
You™re welcome.
 
 

OK.  We™re speaking wi th Selma Engel about 
her late sister-in-law, Bep Jakobs.  Mrs. 
Engel, what can you tell us about Bep?  What do you know anything about her birthday or 
when she was born?
 
She was born in Emmen in, also in
 Drenthe; in Overijssel is a li
ttle town and she come s –  Her 
father and mother had a very
 beautiful store in Zwolle.
 
What type of store?
 
A big sports store;  very, very, they did very, very
 well.  And she had another sist er, ﬁvoti ellipseﬂ 
(ph?  c. 75), in Holland, in Zwolle.  And they 
went toget – my brother and her they we nt 
together when they was 16.  And my  father and 
mother were a little bit 
against it; I don™t know 
why, since we were not so rich 
– (?  c.78); they were very we
ll to do already.  And they –, I 
know she was a very nice person; and they went 
ice skating together.  An
d she was very musical; 
she played beautiful piano.  And she went to college.
 
Oh.  Do you know what she studied?
 
I don™t know; no, no.  I think she just went to high – like gymnasiums .
 
Right, right.
 
But it™s like a college here Š gym
nas i um.  She was very intellig
ent; she wa s very business-like; 
and I know that she was very nice.  And she came 
always; in the war she stayed with my mother 
when I wasn™t there, and also Maur its was with 
the mother.  And they were very much in love 
and was a very nice couple together.  And she 
played tennis; I know reme mber she plays tennis.
 
Was she involved in any of the Jewi sh groups, do you know?
 
No, no.  She was not so much involved in Jewish 
groups.  No; her sister was involved in Jewish 
groups.  She was not so much involved in the Je
wish groups.  She went to school; and she was 
not so much in Zwolle that I reme mber.  She was, perhaps, not in the town so – I, I was not 

friendly with her; she wa s two years older, ther
e was a big difference in the age group.  I was 
friendly with her sister.  And I 
don™t think she wa s from –; I didn™t see her so much.  And, she 
was a very nice person, she was very close with my
 mother; there was rea
lly very happy with.  
And she could knit, and her knitted 
together also with my mother
.  They talk about books; she 
read a lot.
 
And so she married your brother in 1940?
 
In 1940; and she stayed in the parents™ house.
 
Was that before your father di
ed that they got married?
 
After my father died; after my father died.
 
And she stayed in her parents™ house separately?
 
Yeah, because she was not allowed from the German
s to change the address.  So mi ddle in the 
night, 11 o™clock it was dark, 10 o™
clock it was dark; my brother we
nt dark places and went to 

her house.  In the morning, early, he came back to our house.  When daytime, they were together.  
But nights, she was not allowed changes from ad
dress.  And officially, perhaps, the Ge rmans 
were not allowed them t o get ma rried.  So that was –
 
Anything else?  So she was wi th you –
 
She was a big help for my mother to, to – you know.  I was not much home , see, so I don™t 
know exactly what was going –. I c
ouldn™t sit in a 
little house; I hated it. 
 So I went away on 
Sunday, and I came back Friday evening; some thing like that. 
 
So, the last time you saw her 
then, wo uld have been in 1942?
 
Yeah.  The last time  that I saw her wa s beginning 1942.
 
You believe that she probably –
 
She, I think she went, perhaps, together with my
 brother.  Her father and mother would have 
been out to, I think, to Auschw
itz; they went out to Auschwit
z.  Anybody would want to know it 
exactly, they could find it out in We sterbork, in 
the archives in We sterbork.  When you want to 
write that, they will tell you ex
actly; the We sterbork of the Red Cross.  In Holland, they have it 
exactly written down, and they will tell you exactly. 
 When you want to know, write me  a letter.  
Exactly, also my brothers and 
everything, you can find it out exactly
 in Holland.  – (?  c.110).  I 
never want to –.  I was always 
afraid that I would know that th
ey were ma rtyred (?  c.110) and 
things like that, and hoped that 
they went to a camp like Sobibor
 always; but they didn™t go to 
Sobibor.  Oh well, I saw ma ny, ma ny people from
 my home town walk to the gas chamber.
 
So you said, I™m sorry, just to reiterate; sh
e had one brother and one sister; or one sister?
 
No; she had one sister; one sister, yeah.  And her sister lives in Zwolle.
 
What is her name?
 
Saartje.
 
How do you spell that?
 
S-A-A-R-T-J-E
 
S-A-A-R-T-J-E
 
It™s my ma iden name  too. (?  c.115)
 
OK; all right.  Well, thank you very much. 
 Is there anythi ng else that you can remember 
that you™d like to tell us?
 
What I could tell you about Š my brother, 
my brother Braham, didn™t tell you anything.
 
Right, right.  We™ll move on to him.
 
No, I don™t know.
 
OK; thank you.
 

 
OK.  We™re talking wi th Selma Engel about h
er brother, Braham Wijnberg.  Mrs. Engel, 
when was Braham born and where?
 
Braham was six years older that I am, so he™s born in 1916 in De Leek, May the 14
th
.
 
And what do you remember about him as a youth?
  He was a bit older, so he would have 
been a little bit ahead of you.
 
Yeah, he was six years older than I am, and he 
was like my father.  He was very wise, and I 
could always ask him all the questions what I di
dn™t get from anybody else.  And I never went to 
my father; I went always to him whe n I want to 
know things.  And he wa
s very intelligent, and 
he was very nice; and he helped
 in the hotel.  Because he had 
a scholarship, in Groningen, to go 
to college, but he had to go and help in the ho
tel because they just st
arted the hotel; and my 
parents couldn™t afford it.  So he 
didn™t go to college.  Later, he 
went to the hotel
 school; culinar y 
school.  Hotel school is that Š in
 Holland.  And he graduated from
 that, and he helped in the 
hotel ma ny years.  And he was also a dance, da
nc ing teacher; because in Holland, when there is a 

party, there has to be a dance ma ster.  For th
e Holland governme nt you™re not allowed to dance 
when there™s no –.  So he was very popular in 
Holland for the not Jewish places.  And he was 
very popular, and he worked very hard, and give 
also dancing lessons in 
the hotel; also before 
the war.  And I helped him dancing always.
 
Do you remember which dances you would do ?
 
Any dance; any kind of foxtrot and rumba; a
nd we danced for public.  Reme mber once for 1,000 
people were watching; we  were da
ncing.  And we  went to Amsterdam;  we learned to dance.  
And I danced, I was alwa ys dancing with him.  
She has this picture with my dancing clothes 
together with my brother; from
 this woma n.  Ye ah, he was ver
y, very good brother; we getting 
along very well.  And he took me  out a lot, 
and we had a very nice understanding together.
 
So basically, was he wi t h you in 
the hotel when the war broke out?
 
No;  he got ma rried.  He got ma rried in 1940 Š May 8, 1940.  He moved out, and he lived in 

Utrecht together with her fa mily.  And he was not 
in the hotel, and he was not in the war time  too 
connected with us at all.
 
Do you know what happened to him during the war?
 
He was hidden in the war.
 
By a gentile family?
 
By a gentile fa mily, with his wife; and he got 
four children in the war.  And the one, the 
youngest, was born after the war.  And they all were hidden in the war.  And very coincident, 
even the doctor what brought one of the children 
in the world got in contact with them not long 
ago; with one of the girls Š she™s now 46 year
s old.  And the doctor what brought her in the 
world wanted to now what came out of her.
 

So during the duration of the war, they weren™t deported?
 
No.  They were not deported; they we re all hidd
en in Holland.  In Holland, by not Jewish people 
Š different people.
 
Did they remain in Holland after the war?
 
And they rema ined in Holland after the war when 
they went to Canada in 1956.  They went to 
Canada; they emigrated with the whole family to Toronto, in Canada.
 
OK.  And the children still live there?
 
And the children stil
l live there, yeah.
 
OK.  Well, is there anything else 
you™d like to tell me about him?
 
No.  He died very young; he was very upset wh
at was happened in the war.  And he had a 
tremendous guilt feeling, I think, that
 he didn™t tell my parents, my
 mother, and my brothers that 
they should hide some where.  And he was very, ve
ry bitter.  And when he was in Holland later, 
he took the hotel over.  We went
 out of the hotel, and he took the hotel over.  And when there 
came Ger ma ns in the hotel, he didn™t want have
 any Germans in the hotel; and throw them out, 
out of the hotel.  So he get a lot of problems w
ith the police; when officially it™s a public pl ace 
and you™re not allowed to discrimi nate people.  A
nd so he had a lot of problems  that, so he, he 
was very unhappy to be in the hote
l.  And he sold the hotel and 
went to Canada.  That was, I 
think, was one of the reasons he went to Ca
nada.  He was very unhappy person; very unhappy 

ma n; and, I think, because  of the war.  He felt very guilt feeling.  And he died when he was 62 

years in a heart attack, 
and he didn™t want to live; he didn™t 
took care of his health.  He smoked a 
lot Š three packs of cigarettes a 
day; and drank coffee a lot.  I th
ink he didn™t want to live; he 
died really young.
 
That™s a shame.
 
Yeah; it was a shame.  He was very nice guy; I liked him very much.
 
Well, thank you very much.
 
He had four wonderful children; they grow up w
onderful.  So he did a very good job in bringing 
up the kids.
 
Very nice.  Thank you.
 
You™re welcome.
