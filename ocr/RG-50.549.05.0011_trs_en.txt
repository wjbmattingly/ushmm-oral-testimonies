Q: Okay, it™s May 17
th
, 2000 and we™re conducting an interview 
with Mr. Oscar Haber here in his 
home  in Lexington, Kentucky and this is an inte
rview for the Holocaust Survivors in Kentucky 
Interview Project, which is being sponsored by 
the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, 
as well as the Kentucky Oral Hi
story Commission.  We
 are doing an interview that will focus 
mostly on Mr. Haber™s experiences after the Holo
caust because he has been interviewed before 
by the Survivors of the Shoah Foundation.  And ther
e is a videotape that 
is available through the 
Shoah Foundation.  My name  is Arwen Donahue a
nd this is tape number one, side A.  Mr. 
Haber, let™s start with 
your date of birth. 
 

A: March8
th
, 1910. 
 

Q: And you talked about, in your other interview a
nd by the way if we ever repeat anything, we™ll 
try to just cover thi
ngs that we haven™t talked about before.  But I™m sure that you don™t 
reme mber everything that you said and didn™tsay, so I mi ght remi nd you some ti me s if we™ve 

already talked about some thing.  But in your ot
her interview you did men
tion that you went, you 
had an unusual opportunity, you were growing up in
 a small town, in a shtetl and you were one 
of nine children, and you had 
an unusual opportunity to atte
nd a high school, a public high 
school and eventually became a dentist.  And 
I™m wondering how it happened that you had this 
opportunity to study in a public high sc
hool and where the high school was? 
 

A: The high school was in Debica, 
which is in the district of Kr
akow and that was about nine 
kilometers of my village where I was born.  And 
we had, from the age of three, in our house, 
always a teacher, special for religious purposes
.  But by this same  occasion we were studying 
norma l classes.  So in the age of four I could al
ready go in the village to the first class of public 
school and I still was a good pupil, because no one of them was on the level I was.  But I finished 

there the fourth year and my father decided I 
have to go into the small city, which was Debica 
there.  In the same  ti me , he put us in a quarter, 
that means to live in the house of a Rabbi, which 
was teaching us the Hebr ew and the religious teac
hings.  In the same  time I went to the Polish 
public sc hool.  And that was a very di fficult e
xperience because we have to get up in the 
morning at six o™clock, some times earlier, and 
before we went to the public school in the 
morning for eight o™clock it starte
d, we had already to pray and 
to learn Hebrew and to learn 
everything about religious life.  
And more and more.  So, I was th
ere about six years living with 
this Rabbi.  At the same  time after I graduated fr
om the normal school, from the seven classes, I 
applied to the high school, but I was too young.  
Because it was already that you can go to 

school, start school only by the age of seven, a
nd I was four years old.  But I was some how 
fortunate, my father knew the director of this 
high school.  And he spoke with him and he said, 
ﬁ Well I cannot do it.  He has to go normal now to the 
sixt h class at least, at 
least and to repeat.ﬂ  
And my father said,ﬁYou know, ma ke
 him a test.ﬂ  And I got a test
 and I passed the test, but still

he couldn™t take me.  I had to repeat the sevent
h grade anot he r year.  And then I was accepted to 
the high school.  And there I ma triculated
 there and so I continued my studies. 
 
Q: So, what language did you speak at home? 

 

A: Well, the first language we spoke, that was Yiddi
sh.  My father was very religious and he want 
us to know the Yiddish, we are spoken.  But we 
had Polish Gentile servants, too, so we have to 

speak Polish too.  And surrounded by peasants 
who are speaking Polish and you have to knew 
the language.  In the school was Polish of course
.  When I went to school 
in Debica there was in 
the fourth class was already German, too.  So 
I had German, Polish and Yiddish, and of course, 
Hebrew, which was, it was the liturgical language, to
 pray.  At the age of three we started already 
to learn Hebrew and we knew the Hebrew alpha
bet and we knew to pray and most of the 

prayings until today, I know by hear
t.  Most of the thick books, we learn, we have to do it.  And 
the first when you opened eyes at the religious hous e, the first is to wash your hands, that™s the 

first things.  And to ma ke a bl
essing about the washing the hands and you ma ke a blessing for the 
food and you have to thank God that you got up in
 the morning.  That was the first Hebrew 

praying and that was at the age of three.  At the 
age of four we started al
ready to learn the Torah, 
which is the Bible, the Ol d Testament.  Andso we continued to, so therefore I am quite 

acquainted about religious Jewish 
life.  And then later on, of course, in high school we learned 
about, in the public school we le
arned about history and that was 
very interesting, world history, 
too.  And German literature.  And therefore I, 
until today, I am quite acquainted with the world 
literature and especially the German literature an
d the Hebrew, of course.  And the Yiddish.  So, 
this is the way like it was.  It was a very hard
 thing, because the distance to the town was like I 
said about nine kilome ters, eight or nine k
ilome ters.  I don™t reme mber exactly.  And for 
Saturday we used to go home , I mean to the vill
age.  And when we came t o the village Saturday, 
there was the traditiona
l Friday evening meal with the pr
aying, with everything.  In our house 
was there a mi nyan, whi c h is the 
quorum of ten people which is praying, Jews, by Jewish law.  
And my late father, by hims elf w
ith his own funds, he founded a Torah.  He let scribe it, and we 
had a new Torah in our house and there was a pray ing in our house and my father was the ma ster 

of the ceremony.  And the people from the vill
ages around, which were few, not always was 
there the quorum of ten people. 
 But Saturday morning was always a praying in quorum.  If it 
wasn™t quorum, so how ma ny it was, but it was th
e norma l pray.  And we had to know it and to 
participate.  And that was in afternoon, my fath
er take a sleep one hour 
and he took us in the 
room, me  and my brother, because 
my older brother was with me in the school at this Rabbi.  He 
was sitting down and we had to repeat what we 
learned all the week.  My father wanted to know 
what we learned and how far we are continuing to
 progress.  And that was the way like it was in 
our house.  Of course, Saturday was like in the To
rah is resting day.  And 
that was the religious 
way of life.  Nothing was working, nobody was work
ing, even the servants.  Only to feed the 
animals, to milk the cows and that what was doi
ng.  But not working in the field, not other work 
was performed.  Only the most necessary for surviving, which was necessary. 
 

Q: You me ntioned that one of the towns nearby, 
Ropczyce, had a strong Hasi dic tradition.  Did your 
fa mily have any Hasidic 
ties or traditions?    
 

A: My father by himself was a Hasid.  But he
 didn™t go to Ropczyce because  the old Ropczyce 
Rabbi wasn™t more.  The founder of the Hasidi
c move me nt which was Reb Nafthali, which you

know.  And he was no more alive.  There was alr
eady third or fourth generation there and there 
was no potential Rabbi which c
ould, which could affinate 
(ph )
 my father there.  My father used 
to go to Sans 
(ph )
 , whic h was quite a distance, about fifty 
mi les.  To go for holidays there to the 
Rabbi of Sans 
(ph )
.  Als o some ti me s OfBobof 
(ph)
, which is also a little shtetl ther e in the 
surroundings of Sans 
(ph)
.  They we re the very famous Rabbis, which is the continuation of this 
Rabbis is now here in the United States.  They 
are siblings and fa mily offsprings, which are 
continue this Hasidic moveme nt of Bobof 
(ph )
 a nd of Sans 
(ph)
.  And that was, my father was a 
Hasid of them.  He wasn™t, by hims elf, he wasn™t a blind Hasidic.  He wasn™t overdoing.  But the 
basic religious things were holy for him.  And th
at was my father.  Of course my mother did 
everythi ng what my father said to
 do.  The thing was, my fat her, 
his first wife passed away.  And 
from his first wife, gave birt
h a daughter and by the birth 
she passed away.  He was a young 
widower.  He was already thirty-f
ive or thirty-six years old and 
a matchma ker found him a girl of 
sixteen years some wher e in anothe r village there.
  And she came to live with him, and she was 
my mother.  She gave birth to the nine children. 
 And we were in touch with our sister, because 
Jewish law recognize it, one child, 
when it is from the same  father, is a sibling, more even than 
one mother.  That is the religious way and trad
ition.  Interesting enough, our
 sister, she ma rried a 
very interesting ma n, who was, in the beginning he
 was a teacher in our house, teaching us the 
religious ways.  He was very educated in Jewi
sh Talmudic teachings.  And he ma rried her, and 
he succeeded, he became quite a rich ma n.  And sh
e gave birth to eight children.  And there are 
only two children survived and th
ey are still living.  One is ni
nety-two years old, lives in the 
United States.  And the other oneis eighty-five years, that™s 
the youngest one, eighty-four years 
old, lives in Israel. 
 

Q: These would be your nieces and nephews actually. 
 Right?   Officially.  Y
our sister™s children? 
 

A: Are? 
 
Q: They would be your 
nieces and your nephews? 

 

A: Yeah, they are my nieces and we are in touch w
ith them and we are very much in good relations.  
And very interesting story about these two nieces.
  Both of them survived the Holocaust.  The 
one ma rried in the war and had a daughter in
 the war.  And she escaped, run away, being 
pregnant from Debica, I mean this village there,
 to Lvov, which was in the Ukraine.  Then it was 

belonged to Poland, but the Russian invaded this pa
rt of the country, of Polish country.  And she, 
when she saw the disaster in the ghetto, she put her child under a convent™s door.  And was 

looking from far away what happened to this ch
ild.  And she saw that a nun came out and she 
took in the child in the house.  And then she ra
n away and she became a se
rvant, as a Polish girl, 
as a Gentile at the head of the Gestapo in L
vov.  That was the older one.  The younger one had a 
friend in Lvov.  She was in Lvov studying sewi
ng, to be a seamstering.  Mother, very good 
seamster, which she was.  And she met there a bo
y, before the war he was leader already of the 
trade unions.  And when the Russian came in– in
 the beginning he was a very big shot.  But 
when the Russians, when the German invaded, he
 went with the Russian back to Russia and 
there he joined the Polish Ar my, whi c h was orga
nized there by the Poles after their agreement, 
the Polish agreement in exile with the Russians, which allowed them to organize thei r Army, 

which was affiliated to the Russian Ar my.  And 
they were fighting.  And he was fighting the 
Germans until Berlin.  And he put her on a Polish fa
mily.  She was a seamster and she gave bir
t h

to a daughter, but that wa s already in 1945 when 
the war is going to end.  When he came from 
Russia to Poland with the invasion, I mean to fight
 with the Russian Arm
y.  And then she gave 
birth to this daughter.  And when the war was co
mi ng to an end, he became  a governor of a part 
which was annected from Poland from the Germanterritory there.  And he took her there, and 
they had another two sons, but they not living as 
Jews.  And they very talented boys.  And when 
it came in Poland the time where Jews moved fr om
 Poland to Israel in 1965 I guess, was it?   
Something like this.  They came, fi rst time she told
 the sons that they are Jewish and they were 
already both ma triculated afte
r high school diploma.  And on
e of them was already studying 
engineering.  And they came to Israel.  But thei
r father, himself, he in the meantime, being a 
governor he studied at the univers
ity at the same time to become
 an agronom– agronomy.  And 
he came to Israel as an agronom.  But because
 Israel didn™t have 
confidence to all these 
apparatchiks from Poland.  I mean all this comm
unist active parties, he 
couldn™t find a job.  It 
was very difficult to find.  And we were already 
at  this time in Israel  
and I had some connection 
with people and to a me mber of the Israel Par
liame nt.  And I  wrote to them and I warranted 
about him, that he™s not one of the Russian serv
ices and he got a job in agronomy.  But he passed 
away about six or seven years a
go.  In the meantime, the older son is working in a very high, 
secret Israel Ar my factory.  And the other son was 
also an engineer, but in the same  time  he was 

teaching in a school, in a vocationa l school.  And ma
rried a girl from Venezuela.  And one year 
ago they decided that they leave Israel and they 
came  to the United States.  And he got a job here 
in California.  He must be very, very important 
engineer, because he got 
the, he ma de the green 
card and he can work and they bought a house.  
But they have one son, who is at the Israel 
Ar my.  And just now I heard, two w
eeks ago, he went to Israel and 
asked to give hi
m some  off in 
the Army.  And he came to visit him here to the Un
ited Stat es.  He will not stay.  He will go back 
to Israel.  But he decided, his wife and with th
e other two children to st
ay in the United States . 
 

Q: Sounds as if you™ve kept in pretty close t
ouch with whatever me mbers of your fa mily have 
survived. 
 

A: Oh yeah, whatever I have.  I 
have two brothers.  I have a seco
nd cousin, who was– they were all 
in camps.  And they are living here in the United 
States.  My brothers and my second cousins.  
Are we are trying to keep
 all together here.   
 

Q: Let™s go back to the time that we were talk
ing about before the war.  Did you end up going to 
high school then because your father wanted
 you to have oppor– special opportunities? 
 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: That norma lly your other siblings wouldn™t have had? 

 

A: High school, further studies wasn™t the ma in purpos
e of my fa ther.  My father would have very 
much liked me  to go on and study Jewish, ma ybe  
Rabbinical even studies.  But I was very 
stubborn and I was in very difficult conditions, ma
king my study very difficult.  Often in hunger, 
often have to work and to gain my life.
  But I did it.  And I™m happy I did it. 
 

Q: So it was really your, becomi ng a dentist 
was some thing that you r
eally wanted to do. 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0011

A: I, that was my idea.  That was my idea and th
ere was also an idea which 
I got from a c ousin of 
mi ne who was a dentist in the ot
her pl ace there.  And I liked th
e way like he was living.  I was 
enjoying more the free life.  This religious life didn™t ma tch my character.  I wasn™t never, 
never– even being young, following all the instru
ctions and prescriptions, but I was never 
strictly convinced that 
that was what I want to do.  I was 
always looking on the broad world, and 
life was for me , more interesti
ng outside the religious life. 
 

Q: You me ntioned in your first interv
iew that you were 
a Polish patriot. 
 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: Were you politically interest
ed or involved in Polish– well, 
were you interested in Polish 
politics? 
 

A: No, no, no, no.  I was, deep in my soul I was Je
wi sh, but I found that we are living in a Polish 
country, this is Poland and this is our homeland a
nd we owe to be loyal to our country.  That™s 
wherever I am, I found my obliga
tion to be honest and I could a
void serving in the Polish Army 
which wasn™t  easy.  It wasn™t easy.  It was 
very difficult.  But it wasn™t voluntary, because 
Poland was an Army which was called to the Arm
y.  That was not a voluntary army.  You have 
to go, by twenty-one everyone has to go to the ar
my except that some body is unable to fulfill the 
dema nd, sick and so forth.  And a lot of my coll
eagues and a lot of Jewi
sh people usually they 
started to do everything to avoid to go into the 
Polish Army.  I didn™t try it even.  And I did it full 
hearted and I think it was my obligation to do it
, because I owe it.  I understand that it is a 
common responsibility when you are a citizen of 
a country, you live there, you have to do what 
belongs.  But politically I was never involve
d in any move ment, never any move me nt.   
 
Q: Not– 
 

A: I loved Poland.  I loved the countr
y.  It gave us opportunity and then
 that™s it.  I did what I had to 
do.

Tape 1, Side B 
 
Q: Tape one, side B.  We re you i
nvolved in any Zionist organizations? 
 

A: It was a time I was involved in Zionist organi
zation.  It was a time I thought ma ybe one has to go 
to Palestine those times.  I will not deny there 
was not in Poland anti-Semitism.  But you know 
anti-Semitism until today has ma ny faces.  There 
is an economic anti-Semitism, there is a 
political  anti-Semitism and there is a racist  anti-
Semitism.  And for me and my observance, my 
conviction, I think if I analy
ze the Jewish situation in Po
land, it was more economic anti-
Se mitism, with some  reasons, objective reasons. 
 They were nobody™s fault, but the situation 

became so that this anti-Se mitism has his logi ca
l reasons, logical reasons, maybe it shouldn™t be, 
ma ybe it is nobody™s fault, but it was.  I cannot sa y 
there was a racial anti-Semitism.  Well, there 
is in every nation, there are some extreme people,
 which they can get– and they are more doing 
it for personal reasons and for gaining some thing 
of it.  And this is also the political anti-
Se mitism, which is to gain some thing to rule
 over people.  You know?   And Jews were more 
educated, absolutely more educated than the 
common people in Poland.  Because as I told you 
before, I started to study when I was three. 
 You know, and this gives, whatever you study, it 
gives you more advance about people which are ju
st starting to study some thing at the age of 
eight or nine or ten even.  So
me of them didn™t go to school, 
the Polish people didn™t go to 
school ever.  There was illiteracy, too.  So, when
 it came to elections, the Jews, they knew what 
they wanted.  And the masses didn™t know.  Ma
ybe it is until today a 
lot of ma sses don™t know 
when they are going to vote, what they need and wh
at they want.  It is until today everywhere.  
But especially in a country like Poland, which wa
s, which wasn™t so educated.  There was a lot 
of people who didn™t have, it was only by propa
ganda, which was from mouth to mouth, from 
promises and so forth, you know.  And then Pola
nd, I would need to go into the situation of 
Poland, how Poland became  free after be
ing occupied by three countries.   
 

Q: Well let™s not get into overall hist orical– 

 

A: Yeah, I understand.  I understand, but the Jews 
even, in each occupied party, had different 
opportunities.  In the Russian occupied part they 
couldn™t progress like this
 we could ma ke in the 
Austro-Hungarian or in the German occupied 
territory.  So here come s the difference.  
Education, knowledge and education,
 that was, is and that would 
always be the point.  And this 
gave also the impulse fo r political views and fo
r a kind of organized anti-Semitism, which for the 
Jews, for the victims, it is not important what kind of anti-Semitism it is.  He is anti-Semite, why 

and what, we didn™t analyze and that wasn™t importa
nt.  We  had to feel it
 and that what  it is. 
 

Q: When you were in the Army then, in 1935 a
nd ‚36, did you, were you primarily with non-Jewish 
Poles?  
 

A: Ohyeah. 

 

Q: And how wa s that? 

 

A: Ten percent was Jews.  It was the same , a
pproximately the same relative like it was, the 
population was about ten percen
t and there was about ten 
percent was in the Army. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0011

Q: Were you discrimi nated against at al
l for being Jewish during your service? 

 

A: It™s di fficult to say that you were discrimi na
ting because Army is not the thing which gives you 
the time .  You have so ma ny things to do that you 
don™t have the time  to play these game s.  But, 
but, the officers, the Polish offi
cers generally, generally, were anti
-Semites.  What kind?   They 
were so educated, they were so prepared.  That
 was the elite.  That they, but of course, they 
didn™t, they didn™t want to show up as anti-Semite
s.  But you could feel it, you could feel it.  Not 
everybody felt it.  And then like I sa
id, the poorer Jews went to th
e Army because they were not 
able to pay to get free from the Army, not to serv
e.  The rich Jews who didn™t want to go to the 
Ar my, there was always finding a 
way of bribery.  To whom?   To the Polish officers, to the 
Polish doctors, to the Polish secretaries, so that
 they ma de themselves sick and they write and 
they are sick and they cannot serv
e.  And so the poor and little Je
ws were serving in the Ar my.  
There were no too many of the intelligentsia wh
ich was serving in the Army.  And then there 
was another thing.  After ma tricul ation you are going to the officer™s
 school. And in the officer™s 
school, they didn™t want the Jews 
to become  officers.  They were
 there because they we re, after 
matriculation that was the law.  So usually th
ey find always a way to send them back to the 
norma l Ar my, not to live in the school to beco
me  an officer.  There were officers, Jewish 
officers, but very few, very few. 
 It was difficult to advance, to 
be a Jew and to be an officer, a 
high officer in the Polish Ar my.  The r e were high
er officers only me dical officers, because they 
needed them.  They have to take
 them and that™s what it was. 
 

Q: So, by the time  you were in the Service, you 
were a dentist, were 
you a dentist already? 
 

A: Yes. 

 
Q: Yeah, so you were, your goal was just to do the 
service and then get out.  Is that right?    
 
A: Yeah.  When the time  c a me  to go out, I got a phone from Kr akow that one doctor who was by 
himself a Colonel in the Polish Army , doctor, dentis
t.  He had private office.  He was ready to 
retire and he had a private office.  But he got a 
heart attack and they t
ook him to hospital.  And 
they phone to me , they knew that I would go liberate
d, if I will be able to replace hi m, to fill out 
that position.  So the last day in the Polish Army
– and even the greatest  anti-Semite in my unit, 
came to me, they make me a party, my departure, 
that was ad hoc ma ke a party for me .  He ca me 
to me , he said, ﬁYou know I am twenty years in 
the Polish Army.  I am pr ofessional officer, high 
officer.  I™m a ma jor there.ﬂ  He said, ﬁYou are 
the first Jew I know had such a good time  in the 
Ar my like you have.  Like you had.ﬂ  And I said
 to them good bye, and I left.  And imme diately 
the next day I came to Krakow and I start to work
 because I had to fulfill this, this– later on he 
was released fr om the hospital.  He survived a
nd he came to the office, but I still was working 
with him.  He couldn™t work anymore.  So I 
was working with him about a year and a half, 
some thing like this.  And then I opened my own office. 
 

Q: But you said you didn™t have such a good time in 
the– did you have a go
od time socially?   Is 
that what he meant?   That 
you got along with other officers?

A: Oh yeah.  I had a good time , well I got along.  Th
ey were all, needed me because I was there 
practicing dentistry.  After the first, fi rst recr ui
ting, six months, then late
r on I organize a clinic 
and I receive patients.  So they had their families and they were comi ng to me and I had really a 
good time.  I came from the Army with some save
d money, which the families of these officers 

paid to me  for services.  That was very, very, ve
ry little payments, but still I came with quite nice 

saved mone y.   
 

Q: You me ntioned in your other 
interview that you were involved 
with the underground army.  The 
Ar mi a Krajowa.  How di d you get involved with the army and when? 
 

A: In 1942, when we fled, went with the, on the 
Aryan papers, so-called.  We ca me  to a strange 
village there.  And there the lady, which was the owner of the far m which we were given the 

address from the priest to go.  Th
at was his sister-in-law.  Wher
e I was there on this far m, there 
the Armi a Krajowa started to organize herself.  A
nd we ca me there, and I went there as a refuge, 
refugee from the occupi ed territory, German-o
ccupied territory which occupied Poland from 
Poznan.  I said I am from Poznan, and I am hi
ding away because I was a Polish officer and I am 
hiding from the German Ar my.  So when they be
came  knowledge, they turned to me  and ma ybe 

I will join them.  And I said, ﬁWe
ll I cannot be a fighter to go a
nd, with your fighting.ﬂ  I went 
with them sometimes.  But I orga
nized a sanitary station, when some  of them were wounded they 
brought them to me  and I gave th
em some  banda ges or some  treatments, which I had a sanitary 
station.  And I also took care on 
the weapons which they had, and the ma gazine.  They had some  
ma gazine in hiding in the shelter.  And they
 had some  weapons there, which they organize 
some how.  And I was taking, cleaning and taking 
care of it.  And that was my function, I was 
going there and there, I was going close to every 
night I am going there and taking care of it.  
There were some  actions which I am participating, 
but I was never going in the first line to go to 
fight with the Germans.  Never, ever. 
 

Q: Were you afraid at all or nervous that they
 would find, that they would check up on your story 
about having been an officer in Poznan and find out about your identity? 
 

A: First of all, there was a case when some body, th
e  German has , in every village, in every town 
they had– will you lay down?  Lay down– 
 

Q:  I have to– 

 

A: I will approach to you a little 
bit.  They had their spies whic
h are spying what happens to the 
Polish people there.  Wh at they are talking abou
t and what they are doin
g.  And some  of them 
denounced that there is some  activity, that they
 have some  activity.  And they choose Easter, 
1943, yeah?   1943 they choose to go to ma ke an acti
on and to arrest these 
Polish people who are 
in the underground.  They knew from th
is people which they send in this 
Volksdeutsche
 and they 
took there ten people.  Be tween them was the co
mmandant of this base.  His name  was Bilig 
(ph )
, Bi
ig 
(ph )
.  He was  a student of law, of the thir
d year, second or third year.  He was the 
commandant of this unit there in 
this region.  And there was other,
 there wa s a teacher and there 
was several people.  And one was liberated by th
e Germans.  That was suspected that he was 
collaborating with the Germans.  They released 
him.  The ot her nine were taken to Auschwitz.  
This commandant was so beaten 
up that he couldn™t survive.  
Because one of these people who

9
was release, he saw him.  That 
they took him from one room to 
other after hearings.  They took 
him.  He wa s all blooding.  He didn™t  survive.  
No one of them survived.  So the commandant of 
this part was the brother of this woman where 
we were working on this farm.  His name  was 
Kostetski 
(ph )
.  Max Kostetski 
(ph)
.  And this lady, which we were there on this farm, she was a 
very fine, noble person.  She knew that we are Je
wish.  She knew because when we arrived there, 
the brot her of the priest  was there, just ther e. 
 And he was very angry.  He said to the priest, 
ﬁ What did you bring these Jews here?   Why did 
you do it? ﬂ   And he run away very angry.  And 
she knew, but she was a very, very [phone rings] 
fine, noble person.  And she tried to influence 
her brother.  I am an officer and so forth.  A
nd she was helping us a lot with bread, with food, 
everywhere.  Even when we later on, after the 
denunciation, we had to live in other pl ace.  She 
used to come  to bring us bread and all kinds of
 things.  She did help us.  I think ma ybe fifty 
percent of surviving we had to thank 
her. She was very, very, very kind. 
 

Q: What was her name? 

 

A: Pardon? 

 

Q: What was her name? 

 

A: Oscietska 
(ph )
, Stanislawa Oscietska 
(ph )
.  Her father was anti-Semite.  Her husband was a 
terrible anti-Semite.  And the priest was also an
 anti-Semite and still th
at was the priest who 
helped us and gave us the paper. 
 

Q: What was anti-Semitic about
 him?   Why do you say that? 

 

A: He was anti-Se mite, but he was, in my opi
nion he was economic anti-Semite.  Howe ver, he 
didn™t have a business.  But in the church he 
was preaching the Polish people to support Polish 
people, to buy at Polish people,
 but most of the businesses were
 Jewish.  And therefore Jews 
were calling all of this kind of expression, they 
we re calling anti-Semite.  That was economi cal 
anti-Semitism.  They wa nt to support their own people.  I don™t find it wrong.  I don™t fi nd it 

wrong.  I think he as a priest has an obligation to
 his people.  How we di
dn™t like it, how we 
didn™t want it, but still it did hur
t us economically.  But he, as a 
human being and as a priest, he 
told us, ﬁI want to help you because it come s a ba
d time to you.ﬂ  So I cannot say he is a racist or  

he is a political anti-Semite.  He was economical 
anti-Semite.  He was anti-Semite.  We are very 

sensitive.  We Jews are very sensitive, but 
we have the reason why 
to be sensitive after 
thousands of years of discrimi nation.  But still,
 if you have a little bit brain and you want to 
understand huma n nature, you can find some  obj ective reasons why some people are behaving 

so, and not like you would like they will behave.  
We  would like to be taken care on us as the 
Chosen People.  But we are not the chosen, to ta
ke care on us.  We are chosen because we have 
obligations.  We  choose to have
 the obligations.  This is 
the chosen.  We  t ook the Ten 
Commandments, we took the Torah, we took everythi
ng, but we have to perform it.  And if there 
is, you have to love your neighbor as
 yourself.  You can never love like
 yourself, it is allegoric.  
But you don™t have to harm your neighbor.  You have
 to behave.  And that, which in ma ny cases 

we are mi ssing.  Even in the holy books we some t i me s me ntion, ﬁ We are the Chosen People.  

You can do to other people this 
and this and this.  You can take
 interest by non-Jews.  You can 
do this, you can do this, but not to your brothers.ﬂ
  And that was a segregation which was in the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0011
  
 
10
 
 
10
Torah.  There is segregation which we choose to
 ma ke the segregation.  This is the Chosen 
People, not only in the positive sense, a lot of th
ings is negative.  And therefore a lot of people 
who are open-mi nded, they are taking
 the teachings of our fathers,
 not strictly verbally.  You 
make some selection.  You have some humanitari
an obligations as a hum
an being, not blind to 
follow scriptures, but you have to find a way 
how to live with people, how to respect other 
people.  Wh ich is very, very important.  How do 
you respect others, so ot
hers will respect you?   
And this is my conviction which I came  after 
so many years of life a
nd so ma ny readings and 
studying of all, all this which is
 written in the Jewish and in 
the non-Jewi sh books and teachings.  
Well it™s not a– if you know __________, introducti
on, but I mean you ha ve to know to whom 
you are speaking.  I think ma ybe some ti me s I am 
going out of the frame work which this has in 
mi nd, but I still am open-mi nded of
 e verything what happens around. 
 

Q: Yeah, I think it™s valuable fo
r the listeners to know who, who you 
are, what your beliefs are and 
where you™re comi ng from and how you developed thos
e beliefs.  So, but also I wanted to find 
out, just ma ke little bit clear
er the chronology and the geogra
phy of what happened from the 
years 1940 through 1944 or so.  You were, you were, 
you told the story in 
the first interview 
about how you went away to the Russian front. 
 You tried to join th
e Army, you kind of got 
caught underneath the Russian occupation and 
then you ma de your way back to your home 
village of Brzeznica?   Is that 
right?  And then I™m a little bit 
confused.  You me ntioned that you 
were working in an S, were you working in an SS camp?   Was it a concentration camp for Jews 

that you were working in?   Okay, what was the name  of the camp?  
 

A: Pustkow. 

 

Q: Pustkow.  And you were interned there as a prisoner? 

 
A: No, never.  That was one of the mi racles of
 this war ma ybe.  There 
were no ma ny Jews who are 
allowed to go in the camp and to leave the camp.  And that was, by some  mi racle, ma ybe the 
reason was the German discipline, which they foll
owed the orders of the Commandants, of the 
Führers.  When I came to this camp, I volunteer
ed.  That was a working camp and therefore I 
was put into this camp a s  a dentist.  There wa
s no big dentistry and there was no big me dicine, 
but still there was three medical
 doctors and there was rooms  with beds, which in the beginning, 
which people when they got sick, even beaten when
 they were, they could come  to the doctor.  
And they get care, they get care. 
 In the beginning, even some times
 they were released fr om this 
to go to the town, to the little shtetl close to 
Debica there.  There was other assignment to other 
works.  But that was already not in their compet
ence.  In the beginning, how strange it would be, 

there was a Colonel, SS, who was the head of th
is health services there, Oberstur mbanführer 
(ph )
 
Schumacher was his name .  And then, but he was 
ma ybe for two or three weeks and started only, 
that was only in ‚40.  That was not yet nothing. 
 That was the first beginning.  And therefore the 
Jews were slowly getting in circulating.  They 
took him so easy, they took him so by easy.  They 
were voluntary, then later by force and later on by 
annihilation.  They were going by themselves.  
That was the system.  And then afte
r two or three weeks, he left.  
But that was an order officer.  
A lieutenant officer.   
 
End of Tape 1, Side B

Tape 2, Side A 
 
Q: Tape two, side A.  I™m s orry, wi
ll you repeat what you just said? 
 
A: The Jewish doctors, they were the first.  Bu
t if there were some  people unable to work, they 
couldn™t release them.  It has to
 sign, the SS doctor has to sign.  And that what he was doing 
another four weeks.  But later on, 
they left it to the Jews, but the 
situation became  wor se.  There 
was no releasing.  Treating and to work, treating a
nd to work, no release anymore.  In this time  I 
came to– when I organized this little dental 
clinic ther e, so called clinic, everythi ng was 
provisional. 
 

Q: When was it that you organized that clinic? 

 

A: In 1940 already.  The end of 1940 I organized it 
there.  And what could I do?   If somebody has 
toothache, I could help, or to ma
ke an extraction, to pull out a t
ooth.  And that was the things.  
There was no other things, no fillings.  I had to 
ma ke fillings only when an SS ma n didn™t want 
to go to the SS.  They were not 
allowed to go to a Jewish dentist,
 not to a Polish even, nor to a 

German.  They had to go to an SS.  But they kne
w that they will have a special  treatment at the 
Jewish dentist, so some  of them came.  And th
at was a very di fficult ta
sk, because I didn™t have, 
I didn™t have this equipment, which the German 
have.  The German has the most mo dern and the 
most ___________ equipment.  The SS had the most modern.  And there was a lot of cases, 

which I couldn™t treat them at all, and I send them 
to go there.  But they were insisting, they were 
insisting.  And so in beginning, th
at was about a year.  I had an 
ID, SS ID, that I could come  to 
the camp and I left.  The bus was standing, I show 
only the ID and I left.  In the beginning the 
doctors were also leaving, living in Debi
ca.  And comi ng only to work there. 
 
Q: TheJewishdoctors? 
 

A: The Jewish doctors, yeah.  And even some  of
 the workers were allowed to go Saturday and 
Sunday for a day home, but they have to come  back.  If they didn™t come  back, they brought 

them by force and that  was a terrible thing the
n.  So, after a year appr oxima tely, there was an 
order to take the ID™s, SS ID™s from a ll the Jews
.  But I think, I am not sure, because I was there 
a volunteer, there was an orde
r of the Commanda nt of this  camp, of the head, Gillar 
(ph )
 SS 
Oberführer, who gave, day order, wh
ich he gives to the soldiers ev
ery day orders.  He said, ﬁThe 
Jewish dentist can come  to the camp whenever he
 wants.  And every time  when he come s to the 
post they will give him a post who bring him in th
e camp and when he is fi nished, he will come 
to pick him up and take him out from the 
camp.ﬂ  That was unbelievable.  That was 
unbelievable. 
 

Q: Did  that happen because he had a special fondness for you? 

 

A: Because it was in the orde r.  I don™t know. 
 I don™t know.  I cannot comprehend it until today.  I 
cannot understand it why.   
 

Q: Did you know hi m personally? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0011
  
 
12
 
 
12
A: No.  No.  I knew the Commandant, the head of the– I™ll tell you, I me ntioned before, the 
Germans were strict  in their orders.  I was a vol
unteer, and I wa s assigned
 by the working office, 
the special working office, which gave the conti
ngent for the camp, for the people.  Bring them 
and give them to different works.  And because of
 they gave me  this job, I didn™t belong to the 
SS, I belong all the time to th
e working office.  And the head of this working office was a 
German, he became German.  He was a German fr
om origin.  But he was Polish all the time.  
Only when the Germans came in, he became a German.  And he was an officer in the Polish 
Ar my with a German na me .  Eil miss 
(ph )
 was his name, Jule Eilmiss 
(ph )
.  And he was very 
good to me.  I was very good to him.   I gave him from time to time, I gave him all kind of bribes.  

And maybe they respectbecauseI 
was affiliated to this, maybe this was the reason that I di dn™t 
belong to the SS, I belong to the working.  And 
that was the reason.  And when I came  to this 
post and I said, ﬁI am the Jewish dentist.  I need to go to the camp, please give me  company.ﬂ  

And they give me  an SS ma n, who brought me  to 
the camp.  By the entrance to the camp there 
was another SS ma n, but he respected this SS ma n, 
he gave me  over to him.   He opened the gate 
and let me  in.  And whe n I was ready, I went to 
the office and I said, ﬁI want to go out.ﬂ  They 
call to the camp, to the post, a
nd the postman came and take me  out from there.  So, this is, 
everything is mi raculous.  We ll, it 
is mi racle that I am alive and 
that I am here.  But that was 
something which was really extraordinary.  I didn™t hear  for a similar case in all my experience 

of ca mps and Jewish labor.   
 

Q: Were you treating Jewish patie
nts only or were there other 
prisoners there, who were non-
Jewish?   I mean political prisoners 
or some thing, who you we re treating? 
 

A: My treating was only Jews.  There was close to it a Polish camp for political  Polish prisoners, but 
I didn™t go in there and they couldn™t come  he
re.  They brought in, once they brought in two 
Polish prisoners, too, which I had to give th
em some treatment.  But the SS Commandant sit 
down and took my treatme nt and the second 
Schaffner
 
(ph)
 of the camp took my treatment.  And 
other SS people came in my private pr actice home.  Because I ma ke in the house where I live 

like this Polish peasants, I ma ke 
also a little clinic that what 
giv e s  me  my  i n c o me .   A  b a r t er  
business, people brought me  food and I treated th
em.  And so some of these SS people came in 
and they brought me  also some  tea, some  coff
ee, because it wa s not on the ma rket, even black 
ma rket was not to get it.  But the SS had everythi
ng.  And they came in there, most of these SS 
people which were, plus they knew me , because I 
was going into the camp, out and in, and out 
and in, so I was really tolerated in
 this place like persona grata.   
 

Q: Okay, so you were doing that until 1942, when
 the area was evacuated and the Jews were 
ordered to the ghetto?   
 

A: The Jews were evacuated earlier.  The only Je
wish fa mily was my fa mily which allowed, which 
the Kreishofma n 
(ph )
 allowed them t o stay there.  They allowe d only me , but because the Polish 
officer didn™t understand German, so 
I take this opportunity and I left
 all my fa mily there in this 
village.  But there came the Final Solution a
nd they want, nobody could, no 
Jew could be free.  
So I would have to go to the camp.  My wife, Fryda
, had to go with all the fa mily together to the 
ghetto.  From there they went to annihilation, as
 you know.  Some  of them went to the camp, to 
other camps, the brothers, my brothers.  My
 three brothers came  to other camps.   
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0011
  
 
13
 
 
13
Q: So your, at that point your fa mily, di
d they all go to th
e ghetto in Ropczyce? 
 
A: Ropczyce and from Ropczyce they send them i mmediately to Senczyczow 
(ph )
, which was the 
next little town.  And 
from there, about two weeks, they 
send them all to annihilation.  I don™t 
know exactly until now.  I think to
 Treblinka.  I guess they went
 to Treblinka, all of them.  
Except my brothers which went to the other camp, 
to Rzeszow, from Rzeszow to Mielec.  From 
Mielec there was the factory of airplanes, Herman
n Göring Werke.  And they were there.  And 
there my oldest brother was killed there by the Ge
rmans.  And these two brothers survived.  And 
they were taken from there to Germany and they
 ma ke all the ma rches and all the way through.  

And they survived in Germany. 
 

Q: And your Polish, was your Polish good enough th
at you could pass well without worrying about 
language problems as a Pole? 
 

A: My Polish wa s better than all the Polish 
Polish.  Our Polish was exceptional, very good.  
Otherwise the priests wouldn™t give us papers
.  That was the basic things, appearance and 
language, that was the things wh
ich was the mos t  important.  And there was no, any blemish in 
my language and so till today the Polish people who come  here and we are friends, Polish 

people.  They say our Polish is imma culate.   
 

Q: Did you have any, Fryda was talking in the inte
rview that we did with her a little earlier today, 
she was talking about some  of th
e challenges of being in chur
ch and having to adopt this 
persona, where you had to, everything
 had to be just right.  Do you reme mber any trouble that 
you had with that? 
 

A: Not at all.  Fi rst of all, I adopted it very eas
y because living in a villag
e, you are involved in the 
peasant™s life.  You want, you don™t want, you don™t ha
ve the time even, but still.  And so I knew 
about the habits and about everything how the 
Poles live.  And we were living, even being 
Orthodox, my father was a very, very, very 
accepted in the commun
ity, in the peasant 
community.  They respected him very well and 
they came and they lived together.  And my 
father being an Orthodox Jew with ____________ you 
have seen.  And he spoke imma culate 
Polish very well and so did all my family. 
 And i nteresting enough, the children all were 
speaking Polish home, only when father wasn™t ther
e.  When father was in field, because we had 
a farm, so my father was usually, in the summer
 t i me  always in the field.  As you know in a 
village there is always work, never endless, en
dless work.  When my father came , a pproaching 
the house, Yi ddish, immediately Yiddish we
 have to speak at home , only Yiddish. 
 

Q: But your family was unusual then.  I mean, I think it was common for Polish Jewish fa milies to 
be pretty segregated and to ju
st associate with other Jews.  
But your family was much more 
integrated it sounds like. 
 

A: Well the question of integration was more comm
on in the shtetl, where th
ere were around Jews.  
We didn™t have, our closest Jew 
was living a mile from us.  A 
mile in Poland is like hundred 
miles here.  Distances are differe
nt.  And the other Jews were 
comi ng to us to study religious 
things by the teacher which we have in our house. 
 And they were really poor Jews, poor Jews.  
It is di ffi cult to descri be.  Well, in the last 
years, the situation improve
.  But I rememb er as a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0011

child I came in the house of one of the oldest ci
tizens in this village th
at has Haskila Ascheim 
(ph )
.  And he had two sons– three 
sons, one went to the Austri
an Army and later on to the 
Polish Army , because it was just a change from Po
lish liberalization.  It 
was a widow with five 
children.  Of course, the sons cam
e to learn in our house.  Not too much, not too much, but the 
basic prayers, the basi c prayers they learne d.  Th
e other son had also five
 children and they were 
very, very talented children, very
 talented children, but they didn™t have the opportunity to go to 
school, only to the community school, I mean 
to the elementary school.  But they were 
___________, they studied by themselves.  And this two sons became even writers and the 
lawyer in the village there.  And one of the s
ons became a dentist.  And the daughter ma rried.  
Not that this is the point.  The point is that th
is three sons with their 
fami l i es, in the beginning 
there was here two children, here one child, the ot
her one also two children.  They were living in 

one house, where there was only three rooms.  Of
 course no bathroom, nothing like this.  In 
addition, in the big hall, this old Jew had a pub.  
He was selling alcohol to 
the Polish people were 
comi ng, drinking there.  Everythi
ng in this one house.  Later 
on they move on, they some how 
organize them, their living.  And they have thei
r own houses.  No one survived, as far as I know, 
of all these fa milies.  No one.  Of all these villagers, no one survived.  Only one son and a son-

in-law went to America.  But I™m sure he™s not 
more alive and I don™t know if he had fa mily.  I 
don™t know.  One grandson came also to America w
ith a very tricky way.  His father, who was 
already in America, sent him a girl from the Unit
ed States, which he ma rried there, so he could 
travel to America.  But he™s not alive.
  He died.  He was a sick boy.  Lyman 
(ph )
 was his name .  
No one of all this family is around that I know, who survived. 
 

Q: You went from, okay, so in 1942 you went to the Pr
iest™s si ster.  I™m forgetting the name  of the 
town. 
 

A: Jurkow 
(ph )
.  Jurkow, by Szczow 
(ph )
.   
 

Q: And that was near the time wh
en you got involved with the AK?  
 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: Did you, we didn™t get to just talk a little b
it more about your experiences in the AK.  Did you 
have any, do you want to tell us a little bit about that? 
 

A: Well, I™ll tell you.  Thanks to this, my involveme
nt in the AK, I could find a place after I had to 
escape because of the Gestapo which cam
e.  And thanks–.the right place– 
 

Q: Yeah, it™s going to, so I™ll–
 you don™t have to hold it. 
 

A: Oh, and your hand.  I have to support your hand. 

 

Q: I guess– some ti me s I have to lift up my hand.  

 

A: Therefore I wanted to take from 
you.  I understand it.  I give you support. 
 

Q: Tell me  whe n you get tired. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0011
  
 
15
 
 
15
 
A: Yeah, you™ll feel it.  [Laughing.]   

 

Q: Goahead. 

 

A: Thanks to my involveme nt in the AK, I coul
d find a place when I had to escape when the 
Gestapo came  to pick us up.  That was the posi
tive thing what I have of it.  Well, I didn™t 
experience too ma ny fights except one when it wa
s already 1944, when our unit was affiliated to 
a other unit and together we ma ke
 an attack on a poli
ce station, German-Polis
h police station and 
the dam of Roznow 
(ph )
.  Roznow 
(ph)
, that was a big dam which they built on the Danube 
River, not Da nube, but Dunajec rive
r.  That was a big dam.  There was a little one later of in 
Szczow where in the begi nning the Jews built it. 
 But that was only in 1941, ‚42.  But later on 
they took away all the Jews in other camps.  I 
don™t know what they did to them.  I don™t know.  
And there was then a fight, which was quite a real
 fight with this police, but the Polish police 
hand over herself and the Germans, some  escaped, 
some  were killed.  And that was the source 
where the AK gets more  weapons there, from there.
  No, I am not.  You can hold it.  I have here 
support.  That was really when I, by my walki
ng in the nights to the base where we have the 
weapons there, I me t some  of the AK me n, whi c h 
usually no AK me n knew more than other two.  
That was a conspiracy.  And interesting enough, 
the ma in active AK ma n in our unit, which was 
really an active guy, he was doing by hims elf a lot 
of things, he was a released criminal prisoner 
from Polish prison.  And from hi m I got also fo
r myself a gun, which I had one, but I didn™t have 

enough ammunition for it.  And he was the one who 
give me another gun and then I have some  
more ammunition, some  more for security.  [Phone ri
ngs.] I di dn™t use it because I didn™t need it, 
but I was ready in case I will need it.  I had a grenade and I had a weapon, I wouldn™t go into 

prison voluntarily.  I will kill some  Germans and myself, that was my preparation to do.  

Otherwise I didn™t have 
anything special.   
 

Q: Did you have any, I know that it was a challe
nge, the AK has a reputation for being very anti-
Se mitic.  Did you have any trouble or  close calls
 with that?   With a
nybody finding out you were 
Jewish?  
 

A: The only thing which I know, which came thr
ough me in the place where I was living, in the 
neighboring village was another un
it of AK and t here was a comma
ndant, and all the orders who 
came from the ma in office were passing from on
e unit to the other.  And through me  was passing 

from this unit, through me to my unit.  A
nd that was already in 1944, by the end of 1944.  I 
usually tried to know what happens because I di
dn™t have a radio.  I was relying on the news 
which I got from the acquaintance, what they ge
t to me .  But from this, from this orders who 
came, I found some  orde rs what happens at the 
front.  There was always 
me ssages what is to do 
and so forth.  And the last me ssage which I go
t, I opened it too.  Then
 I close it and I send it 
farther.  There was a me ssage, the Russians are a
pproaching, not to hand ove
r, not to give them 
over our units.  And before they come  in to clean
 up all the rest of the units of the people which 

are, which you will find in the forests, whether it is Russian pa rtisans or ot her ki nd.  It didn™t 

me ntion exactly Jews, but who was there in the 
forest?   That was the only thing which I have 
personally me t.  From person to person, I didn™t
 me t, only I say the other two AK men and they 
didn™t know that I am Jewish.  They didn™t 
know.  And they, we never spoke about it.

Q: Were you afraid at all during that time? 
 

A: Well that is difficult to say, 
afraid.  But you are always watchi
ng what you are saying, what you 
are doing, not to be different.  You have to dr
ink alcohol, the moonshine 
like they are and to do 
everything like they are doing when they come  
together.  Even if you don™t know them, but you 
have to go on the way like this.  And if they 
are cursing, you have to cu
rse, if it is damn, or 
another.  You have to be always, 
not try to be different, not try 
to be different, that™s the ma in 
point what you have to do.  S
cared?   Of course, you are always scared.  You know, when I was 
watching and going walking in the night from one vi
llage to the other, if 
I heard a frog jumping, 
my ears were so sensitive, I heared it.  Becau
se I want to know what happens around me , to be 
always prepared and always the hand on the 
gun.  And I didn™t continue
 to go until I found out 
what is this noise, if it is not
 people.  I find the frog and then
 I continue to go.  That™s it. 
 

Q: How did you meet Frantiszek Muschau, who 
you talked about in your other interview? 
 

A: He was working on this far m–

Q: So you were working together, and you 
got him involved eventually in the AK? 
 

A: I recommended to my commandant, I recomm
ended my commandant to accept hi m.  I also 
accepted the other one, who became the priest, the 
anti-Semite, which was.  And this Muschau 
was a very nice ma n, very nice ma n.  And he was not like the common pe asant.  He was already 

more civilized because he  was working in France
 as a mi ner, several years.  And he came  up 
from France.  He brought some  furniture from Fr
a nce.  And he was already more progressive.  

And we exchanged different opinions about the 
situation, the political 
situation.  About the 
Germans, about the Russians, so forth.  We  were 
politicizing.  He was inviting me  in his home.  
We are drinking and eating there.  And he invite
 the neighbor.  He has a neighbor there, one 
Kilbasa 
(ph)
, who ca me  also and they want to hear wh
at happens in the world.  And I have also 
some  news from my fellow ma n.  So they accepted 
all the news from me as
 an intelligent Polish 
officer and Polish patriot, of course.  And that wa
s always, with the alcohol, with moonshine.  I 
drank moonshine in my life, maybe I 
could make a bath in it and swim. 
 

Q: Was that hard to get used to?   Drinking th
at much without slipping 
when you were drunk?   I 
mean, letting something slip? 
 

A: I never allowed to be drunk.  I always want to
 have my clear mi nd, because that was the most 
dangerous thing, to lose your mi nd.  To be drunk.  So
 when I felt, I run it out somewhere, I make 
like I am drinking another one, another one, but I di
dn™t drink it.  But still it was quite a bit .  I 
am happy that I could tolerate it as much as I could. 
 

Q: What happened towards the end of the war?  
 Did you have, you had information about what was 
happening through your involveme nt with the AK 
that you knew where the Russian front was 
and whether they were adva
ncing and so forth?    
 

A: Well you could hear.  First of all, there was 
a situation about four m
onths, more than four 
months.  The Russians stopped on the river, they di
dn™t cross the river Vist
ula to help the Polish 
resistance, the Uprising in Poland for political reas
ons.  They want the Poles to be annihilated by 
the Germans and then will go and kill the Germans.
  That was a very courageous thing to ma ke 
from the Russian side.  But that was a very, very 
bad thing instead to help 
to fight the Germans.  
The Germans killed a lot of Polish people.  And 
of course, a lot between them the Jewish, which 
were fi ghting with the Poles, fr om the rest wh
ich rema ined there between the Poles.  And we 
have all the news about the uprisings.  There 
was, in the bunker where the commandant, ours, 

was sitting, they had a radio, which they are 
listening to Radio London, fro m London,  BBC, they 
have all the news and the move me nt s of the Ru
ssian Army.  And I knew in one day they brought 
to me , two English pilots, who escaped from 
the camp, from the German camp, and I had to 

transpor t them to the Russians, because the United
 States had air bases in
 Russia.  Because the 
United States were already allies with the Russi
ans.  And I was already, I said already good bye 

to Fryda and I was already on the way to go.  But in the meantime when they came  to the next 

base they told me not to go farther because the fi
el d are mi ned everywhere.  I will not be able to 
cross.  So I left them at this Polish unit there 
AK where I brought them there and I came  back to 

Fryda there.  And we are waiti
ng the other four months and th
en you didn™t need the knowledge, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0011

18
you heared the bombardme nt with the Russians st
arted on the river there, from a distance to 
bombard artillery.  And then they st arted to move.  And that was it.  And so we became so-called 
liberated.   
 

Q: One second before we go on, I just want to
 ma ke sure I understand your–  So, you were 
involved with the AK, but you were also working 
on a farm?   Is that right?   So how did you?   
When did you? 
 

A: In the night. 

 

Q: Oh, at night time you 
worked with the AK? 
 

A: The AK didn™t work in the day.  They
 were always working in the nights. 
 

Q: Were you, you weren™t, we
re you getting any sleep? 
 

A: Oh well I came , it wasn™t until late at night.  It
 was till twelve, one o™clock.  And then in the day 
I was sleeping there.  Where we had a shelter with
 Fryda there, over the pigs there.  We had a 
shelter there and there we were sleeping.  
We  had enough sleeping there.  Enough sleeping. 
 

Q: Did the people who were shelte
ring you know that you were working–? 
 

A: Oh no.  They knew that I am AK, and that I am 
officer, but no, they are not suspicious that I am 
Jewish.  No, no, no.  Because the son, which is studyi
ng for priest.  He was by himself, he said, if 
I will catch a Jew, I will 
cut in pi eces and they should salt on it.  As I said, he was a very, very 
bad anti-Semite.  His parents were not anti-Semites.  They were very simple peasants.  They 
didn™t understand and think about it
.  Well, they boarded Jews and 
they went to the shtetl, they 
had their acquaintance with Jews. 
 But of course they preferred, 
they love d the Polish and the 
Catholic.  It is norma l, it is norma l.  But they di
dn™t hate especially theJews.  But the son, which 
was already studying priesthood and th
ey knew already, they told him already, at this time  they 
were still teaching that the Jews killed Jesus 
and so forth.  So, this young priest, no wonder that 
he hated Jews.  That was indoctrinated.   
 
Q: So you me ntioned the ﬁso-calle
dﬂ liberation.  Did you feel in 
any way as if you were free? 
 

A: It was a very, very, very mi xed feeling.  On
 one side you felt the Russians are comi ng, you will 
not be more in danger as a Pole, but as a Jew, 
you continue to be in danger.  And then came the 
reality.  You find out what happened.  Because 
until now, you heared only, they killed here, they 

killed here, they killed here.  But the disast
er so big, you realized onl
y slowly when you were 
liberated.  When you came to the big city, Krakow,which has before the war, in the war even, in 

the beginning, ninety thousand Jews
 and you barely find five or six 
people which are Jews.  That 
was a trauma  which you couldn™t, you couldn™t 
hand it.  You were, and you were asking by 
yourself, why me ?   Why didn™t Anna do what I did?
  You start to analyze and to understand and 
those are things that you cannot
 understand until today. 
 Because there were wiser people than 
me , speaking Polish better than me  or the same  like me , having connection with people.  Why 

didn™t they survive?   Why didn™t they choose our 
way?   Wa s it right we did?   And what is the

19
role we have to play by being alive?   Try to orga
nize a Jewish life, or forg
et about it?   No Jews, 
no Jewish life.  You are Polish.  Go on, be a Pole.  And that™s what ma ny Jews do it, did it.  And 
there are until today Jews which are living as Po
les.  They said, ﬁForget about it.ﬂ  But we 
couldn™t do it.  Our roots are too strong.  I don™
t know.  We  di dn™t know what to do.  We didn™t 
know what to do.  We  were poor like mi ces.  We  
had to look, to find some thing to eat, not to 
speak about finding a way to organi
ze your life, to start to be a human being.  You are out of it, 
you are no huma n anymore.  You start to re
alize you live surrounded in
 animosity.  And you 
look for some Jews.  And I found some.  I reme mb er
 the first night we didn™t have where to go.  
No home .  But some how we me t somebody.  I don™
t reme mbe r .  I think I knew these people or 
recognize them as Jews.  And I did ask him, ﬁ Who
 else is here?ﬂ  He said, ﬁCome with me.ﬂ  
And I went with him, or with her better.  Andwe came in a dark room and there were already 

several Jewish people, survivors fr
om all kinds of surviving.  And 
we sit there in this room, in 
this dark room and started to sing Jewish songs,Yiddish songs, very nostalgical Jewish songs.  

All the Yiddish songs were sad, all we re sad.  But 
in this mo ment, they were healing.  They were 
like Balsam on a wound.  Re me mbrance for a mo me nt
, your heritage.  And we passed this night, 
I don™t reme mber, on songs and somehow sleeping s
itting on a broken couch. 
 All together there 
were ma ybe six, seven pe ople.  And each one with 
his song, not with story.  We didn™t talk yet 

about story.  We, somehow, I don™t 
know how to explain it.  Is it 
shame or is it– I don™t know.  
But we are here.  We  left everything behind and 
we are sitting here.  Nostalgia, reme mbering 
Yiddish songs.  Don™t think even what to do, where to go farther.  But we  woke up in the 

morning, woke up.  We  didn™t take our work clot
hes.  We  were in the clothes which we had, 
these poor clothes.  We  fi nd out from one of them 
that one of my friends survived.  Where is he?   
Who is it?   He was before the war, he was a lady
 beautician parlor.  Father was a barber, and he 
had a nice sister.  And I used to come  to their ho
use before the war.  And he survived on papers.  
But he was already in the Russian intelligence. 
 Polish uniform, the Russian intelligence.  And 
some how I me t hi m.  I don™t reme mber exactly how. 
 And I asked him, ﬁ What is to do.  Where to 
go?   I don™t have a house.  I don™t 
know where to go.ﬂ  He said, 
ﬁI got back my apartment.ﬂ  
There are two bedrooms, a kitchen on the 
third floor in the __
_____________ Jewish section.  
But he says, ﬁYou can go there.  And some how we 
will fi nd there some  way to sleep.ﬂ  But there 
were already some  people in, which survived 
Auschwitz.  That was a girl, a boy, and another 

girl.  And then came other people.
  I don™t know who this were.  We  all were there, but we didn™t 
have a bed to sleep.  We  slept on the floor.  
And I decided, we decided to look around, and we 

went to my village.  To this older woma n, who t
ook us on.  And she fed us, she gave us to eat.  
And we left in their house some  of our clothes, so
me  of our furnishes.  And she was already, she, 
not her son, who lived nearby– because my mot her, 
my grandmother, my  brother™s sister lived 
in her house and I lived in the son™s house.  There I ma ke a little clinic there in his house.  And 

we went there to sleep in the night in his 
house.  In the night, some body was knocking at the 
door and the window.  And there™s, in Russian, ﬁ
Kroy
 
(ph )
! Open!  You have here Jews!ﬂ  He 
said, ﬁI don™t have Jews.  They
 are Polish people like you, like we.ﬂ  They came in.  He  opened, 
because this was soldiers which were in the 
camp , where there was once a camp.  Ther e was a 

field hospital for wounded Russian 
soldiers.  And this were wounde
d soldiers which were there 
in this, but they were strong enough to go in be
tween the Poles and to make connections with 
them.  And I  understand, I am not sure, I am nine
ty-nine percent sure.  They went to the rich 
Poles where we left  a lot of things and he told th
em to go there, the Jews came  here.  You have to 
kill them, very simple.  And for them to kill a 
Jew is like kill a German.  They like a soldier, 
especially a wounded soldier, a fr
ont soldier.  And they came in
 and said, ﬁAre you Jewish?ﬂ  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0011

20
And I understand Ukrainian, too, because in the Po
lish Army  where I served there were mostly 
Ukrainians there.  I said, ﬁThere™s no Jews he
re.ﬂ  ﬁ Who are you? ﬂ  We  had the papers.  Said, 
ﬁ We are here, only sleeping here.  We  are Polish.ﬂ We ll, okay, they left.  They went to the house 

of the mothe r , the mother™s house 
and they the same .  ﬁ Where are 
the Jews here?ﬂ  ﬁThere are no 
Jews.ﬂ  They gave some  shots in the air and they 
left.  In the morning we 
said to the son of our, 
we told him to help us to move.  We  want
 to move back to Krakow.  But there was no 
communication, there was no train.  And I want to ta
ke some  of this furniture to have some thing 
to sleep.  So, he took the horse of his mother
 and the other horse from a ne ighbor and a wagon 
and we started to move to Krakow.  That is 
about sixty miles from, hundred kilome ters, hundred 
ten kilometers, something like this. 
 

Q: What had happened to your house in Brzeznica? 

 

A: Our house was burned. 

 

Q: When did that happen? 

 

A: It was burned.  It happens when we were there 
still.  After we left, close to the house there was a 
railway and a spark of this coal fire fell on th
e house there and it burne
d.  So, there were not 
house.  And these Polish people, who used to 
live in the house, took over our house.  He was 
living in the barn which was close to it.  There 
was a horse barn and coal barn and he was living 

there.  So for us he wasn™t moving out and I didn™t want him and I didn™t want to be there.  So 

we started the way to go.  And we didn™t want to
 go with the ma in road 
because there still the 
Russian Army was moving.  And they were taki
ng the horses from the Polish people for their 

use. 
 
Q: About when was this?   Do you know the approximate date?   
 

A: It was 22
nd
, no 25
th
 of January, 1945, after the Russians ca
me in.  We start there the way to 
Krakow.  It is not describable the conditions.  
We  had to take food for the horses first because 
you couldn™t buy this.  Nobody would sell it.  The m
oney didn™t have any value anymore.  And 
the horses, if you don™t feed them, they will not 
go.  And you have to have the food on the way 
back, too.  So the most of the wagon was food.  And we took also some  of the furniture which 

we left there and some  of clothings we left th
ere, also.  They took it out from the ground, they 
dig it out.  And they give us back everything, ev
erything.  They were very honest people.  On the 
way my wife was more dead than alive.  She wa
s fainting and I had to do, to work on her.  And 
by the way we were going around way, it was a longer way but more secure.  _____________, 

where the army wasn™t going.  I knew the Polish 
geography very well.  I 
know how I will get to 
Krakow by longer, around ways.  We  came to an ort 
(ph)
, which was called Zakroczym.  First of 
all we passed a place which is called Tochow 
(ph )
.  At Tochow there used 
to live a sister of my 
mother, with her family.  Her husband, her 
daughter with her husba
nd.  I don™t know how ma ny 
children she had in the meantime.  And the sons 
all run away to Russia, 
and they survived in 
Russia.  The husband too, the old husband, too.  But he
 died in Siberia, in Russia.  They all were 
sent to Siberia to Infada 
(ph )
, to Sever 
(ph )
, to Jakutz 
(ph )
, or Jakutzia 
(ph)
.  That was where 
they banished all the criminals in the older countr
y revolutions there.  With all the hi st ory there, 

there were trees which ten people have to surroun
d it.  Such a tree, such forest.  And they 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0011

21
brought them there and they said
 to them, ﬁHere you have to liv
e.ﬂ  No houses.  Their houses 
were from s now, and their windows were from i ce.
  And they had to work there, but all right 
that™s about them.  That™s another story.  But I 
came  to this Tochow.  And I did ask the Polish 
people there because no Jew was there, ﬁWhat happe
ns?ﬂ  They said, ﬁAll were killed and some  

rema ined they were sent to the ghetto at Tarnow.ﬂ  That was the end.  No one Jew was there.  No 

one Jew.  So I continued to the next shtetl which 
was Zakroczym.  And of c
ourse we have to feed 
the horses.  And we want to come  down to move a little bit like I say to y
ou, to try if we can go.  
We were sitting on the wa gon all the time.  A
nd this poor Polish guy, this Soltys Stanislaw was 
with us, he was the forema n.  And while we
 wanted to come  down, Fryda fell down on the 
ground, fainted again.  I save her.  I put he
r on the ground laying down, make some  exercises 
with her.  Put her on the wagon b
ack, she faint again several time s.
  And when we fed the horses, 
we went to continue to go.  But the night ap
proach and in the night
 you couldn™t, you are not 
allowed because it is curfew.  The Russians didn
™t joke.  Whom they found on the street they 
killed.  So, I went to the first Polish h
ouse there where there wa s a little bit space–

Tape 3, Side A 
 
Q: Our third tape, so this is ta
pe number three, side A.  So there came , a woma n ca me  out of the 
house?  
 
A: And she asked me  what do I want?   Said, ﬁWe have
 to go to sleep, to take
 in.ﬂ  And I took Fryda 
from the wagon and I tried to put her in and th
e woman said, ﬁ What are 
you doing? ﬂ   I said, 
ﬁ Well we have to warm her up a little bit, because
 she is sick.ﬂ  And she looked at her and said, 
ﬁ Well what do you think?   She is dead already. 
 Better one to put in 
the grave, like she is 
looking.ﬂ  But I took, outside I found 
a brick, an old brick.  I put it,
 ma ke a fire and warm up the 
brick and I warm up a little bit.  And so at th
is house, on the floor, we slept through until the 
morning.  In the morning we start to go, and we we
nt and we came to Krakow.  We  went to this 
house of our friend there and we put what we have, 
these little furnishes on the dirt floor.  This 
guy helped us, Stanislaw Soltys helped us.  And he 
went back with the horses, back to his home, 
he had to give back the horse to the neighbor.  
That was sacrificing.  I don™t know how he did it 
or why he did it.  It was not human, that was ange
l work.  In this time  to go back, to endanger the 
horses, which is all what the people have, a horse, a 
cart, but he did it.  And she gave us a little 

products, half a bread, which was the big peasant br
eads, and some beans, some barley, and we™ll 
have some thing to cook and to eat.  That was 
our food at the beginning. 
 And so we are being 
there with all this people around us, other people
 living there.  And Fr
yda went to the house, 
which was their house before the war, their apartment.  And t here was the janitor of the house, 

which was the janitor before the war.  He was a 
carpenter working in their furniture store.  A 
dirty, drunk ma n.  And s he said to him, ﬁMaybe ther
e will come some post 
here on this address.  
We are here living–ﬂ and she gave the address 
where we are living.  And he, ﬁAnd what will be 
if I bring you a post from your father? ﬂ   And sh
e says, ﬁWell, you will get a hug and a kiss.ﬂ  He 
said, ﬁAll right.ﬂ  A few days later he came w
ith a card, post card from Auschwitz.  And he said, 
ﬁ
Pana Fryda
 
(ph )
, Miss Fryda, I get a kiss.ﬂ  And she give
 him a kiss and a hug.  ﬁI got post card 
from your fa ther.ﬂ  And we have this post card.  
You saw it I guess.  And he is sick and he asks 
to come to pick him up.  In the meantime, I me
t another acquaintance of me .  He had a dental 
offi ce, quite a primitive offi ce, but a dental offi
ce in an apartment which wasn™t hi s.  It  did 
belong to a Jewish woma n before the war.  She 
was even the owner of the house.  And she and 
her daughter survived.  But in this mo me nt, she wa
sn™t there yet.  She was in a camp some where.  
And I me t him and I said to him, ﬁ What are you doi
ng? ﬂ   And he said, ﬁWell I have here a dental 
office.  But I™m leaving this office.  I want to
 sell it because I am leaving to the once German 
territory.  There I will or ganize a modern dental 
offi ce, an apartment and I will be living ther e.ﬂ  
He married, he survived as a partisan.  He 
married a Polish, Gentile woman.  And he lived 
together with her.  I guess he had some  children w
ith her already.  But he was, he was a partisan 
in the Soci alistic, not in the AK, in the 
AL, that was Armi a Ludowa.  That was the 
Volks
 party.  
And they were more lenient to the Jews.  And 
he was a good fighter.  He was a strong guy and he 
was really fighting there, in this army.  And he 
said, ﬁMy party will help me to organize ther e.ﬂ  I 
said to him, ﬁSell me  your office here, for a begi
n, it will be good for me .ﬂ 
 He said, ﬁI will not 
sell you.  I will rent it to you because maybe I don™t 
find nothing there.  I will come  back.ﬂ  Said, 
Okay.  I can™t give  you nothing.  I don™t have nothing.  But for the first money what I will make 

as a dentist I will send it to you some
how.ﬂ  And I start to orga nize 
a pr actice.  And I ha d first of 
all, a room to sleep, a nice room to sleep with 
a bed, with a couch, quite 
a nice room and a nice 
kitchen.  And that was for the mo me nt a wonderful 
solution.  But I started to
 think, ﬁIf he did it,

maybe I can do the same.  I will go to the German
 occupied, German-Polish occupi ed territories, 
Poland occupies German territories
.  And there were a lot of den
tists and dentist equipment and I 
will organize my clinic there.  And to live th
ere.ﬂ  And I went ther e, but I didn™t fi nd nothing 
which I would like.  So I left Fryda there.  We
 met there another guy, a su
rvivor who was already 
working for the Polish security, in the Polish secu
rity.  He wrote a book about it.  He lives here 
in the United States.  He became a very rich guy here.  And he became an officer.  He survived 
in his village there.  However they were tryi ng 
to kill hi m fr om the AK, too.  But he survived 
some how.  And he was in this part which became
 occupied by the Russians first, the first month 
there.  And the Polish units there 
sent him to an officer™s school 
and he became an officer in the 
Polish security.  And then when the Russians mo ve
d, he moved with them. He ca me  to Krakow.  
And he ma ke a lot of, find a lot 
of Polish people whom, whom he
 gave over to, handed over to 
the Polish security.  But while the Russians occu
pied the German part, they sent him to Wr oc
aw 
as an officer there of their secu
rity.  And then they send him to 
Lidnice, Lidnitz, where we were.  
And where I was looking for some  dental equipm
ent, he was working in his job to look for 
Germans.  And we met.  And we make a recogni
tion as a Jew and he as a Jew.  We  didn™t talk 
too much about it.  He said, ﬁWhat can I do for 
you? ﬂ  I said, ﬁYou can help me  to find some –ﬂ 
He said, he™ll try. 
 

Q: How did you, let me  just interrupt  briefly.  How did you ma ke that recognition?   Was there some  
special way?  
 

A: Well, I recognize him as a Jew.  His name  was Polish, Zalewski 
(ph )
.  And when I me t him, I 
said, ﬁZaleski, but what is your 
real name ? ﬂ   And he was from
 Kolbuszowa, which was not far 
from my village, about twelve kilometer.  That™s 
about eight miles.  It was quite close.  And I 
knew people from Kolbuszowa.  And he told me , ﬁMy name  is Zalschitz 
(p h )
, Nafthali 

Zalschitz.ﬂ  And he was called Ta
dek Zalewski, Tadeusz Zalewski 
(ph )
.  But I left Fryda with 
him, and I went back to Krakow to see how to 
organize life in Krakow.  I found some  instrume nt 
which I can use there.  And when I came to 
Krakow, I found this, I have to go, well I mi x up 
because I don™t go chronological.  Before we left 
I went to Auschwitz to take Father, he r father 
from Auschwitz. 
 

Q: You went actually to the camp?    

 

A: It was no more camp there.  [Phone rings.]  It 
was liberated by the Russians.  That was a card we 
have that he was there.   
 

Q: Right. 

 

A: So I went there with the Russi
an trucks, I went there with taki
ng ammunition to the front.  There 
was still war, but Auschwitz was already liberat
ed.  And he was the one who rema ined in the 
hospital there because he couldn™t go farther.  And he
 said better, they ask to leave, but he said 
he preferred to stay here to be
 burned and not to go.  And they
 shoot all the other people who 
went there.   
 

Q: Did you, before you, so this is around February 1945, right? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0011
  
 
24
 
 
24
A: It™s January, still January. 
 

Q: Okay, did you know, did you know what had ha
ppened at Auschwitz at that point?    
 

A: Well, I knew from Poli sh accounting, but 
when I came there I found everything.  I found 
everything.  And when I saw him, I had all the hi
story.  That was a ma n who was taller than me  
and he was fifty-six pounds, I guess.  I took in a 
blanket a heap of bones.  And I was waiting for 
a truck to take him to Krakow.  But that was before
 we left  to the occupi ed territories there.  And 
Fryda took care of him, a nd he came to his quite
 normal.  But that was already February when 

we left for– even mor e  later, ma ybe March already.  It is difficult now to reme mber the dates 

exactly.  So we left  Father in this apartment wher
e we lived.  We  left to him.  And we  went to 
look for, find some  existence there with the idea ma ybe we™ll take him over there to us. 
 

Q: Can we go back?   I know you already did go forw
ard, but go back to the Auschwitz experience 
and what you– you me ntioned you really discovered
 what had gone on when you were there.  

What did you experience? 
 

A: Not too much.  All what Father-i n-law told us
.  I didn™t have the time and the courage to go to 
look what happens around.  But he had enough to r
ecount his stories of what happens during the 
time.  But on the way back from this occupied te
rritory to Krakow, I have
 a car accident.  And I 
have broken my leg, my hand here, and I was 
taken to the hospital inst ead to go home.  
Some how I could let know Fryda th
at I am in the hospital.  Th
at was everything through people, 
which are communicating, commuting 
there and back.  So, she came back.  She decided to come  
back.  She didn™t have money, not even for to 
pay the Russians to give the vodka for commuting 
with them.  But while she was at this friend™s hou
se, he became  our good friend, this officer, this 
Tadek Zalewski.  His wife, she wa
s Jewish too, she survived also 
on Christian papers.  She said, 
ﬁI can™t give you anything money.ﬂ
  She want to give her some  
jewelry, but Fryda didn™t want to 
take it.  But while she wa s sleeping, she put in 
her bag a golden bracelet.  And Fryda when she 

got up, she said, ﬁWhat is this yet?
  I didn™t have a bracelet.ﬂ  She 
said, ﬁTake it, you™ll need it.  
Take it, you™ll need it.  I don™t need it now.  So
meday you™ll pay me  back.ﬂ
  I don™t reme mber if 
she took it.  I guess she took it and she came back to
 me , to the hospital.  And she had to take 
care of this poor father and of this poor husba
nd.  In the meantime, we got connection by ma il 
with a brother of her father, an uncle, Uncle So
lomon in the United States.  And when he heard 
that his brother survived, that we survived, he
 open– in Krakow, an open account.  ﬁHow much 
you need, you can have and take.ﬂ  And there was 
the connection who gave us the possibility to 
survive further.  But that was already a few mo
nths later, because ma il didn™t function so easy. 
 

Q: At that time were you really thinking th
at you wanted to stay in Poland permanently? 
 

A: Well, I didn™t think so much about Poland.  I di
dn™t want to stay with 
the Russians.  I knew the 
Russians before.  Poland I wouldn™t mi nd, even, 
to stay, because I had my roots there, you 
know?   With all mi nuses I thought I would be ab
le to organize a good life in Poland, even I 

thought in my dreams, on our farm.  
I said, I will keep the farm.  I™
ll keep a clinic 
there, help the 
people.  And having a nice living on the farm.  I 
love the farm too.  We have a big farm, a nice 
far m.  And i t  was the ni cest farm in the village.  I thought some ti me s that will be  okay.  But 

when I thought about the Russians 
and the system of their, when 
they bring in, I would not have 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0011
  
 
25
 
 
25
the farm and I would not have my freedom so I st
art to think to move from Poland some where.  
Some where, the nearest approach was to Belgium,
 where Fryda has a brother of her father.  In 
the beginning we want to go to Germany, because
 one of my brothers, who lives now in the 
United States, came to visit us in Poland.  He c
ouldn™t take us.  When he came only for  two or 
three days.  And he saw our mi sery there and he tried to help us what he could.  And he said, 

ﬁCome in Germany we have apartment.  You™ll ma
ke a living there for time being.  Come there.ﬂ  
And we found a way where they were repatria
ting German families from Poland to Germany.  
So there was a woma n, she came to our house.  She was ma ki ng all kind of businesses, a Jewish 

woma n from Krakow.  And she had the connection 
how to organize, to join people who want to 
go to Germany with the German repatriates.  We
 left our apartment.  We  went to Katowice, 
which was on the border to Germany.  But when 
we came there, we were there two days, there 
was no transport going to Germany.  They already, 
the last transport left.  And you have to wait 
another month or two and I couldn™
t wait in Katowice ther e, so we 
decided to go back to Krakow 
there.  And in Krakow we stayed there until
, I guess it was August, I guess, when we fi nd a 
connection which some body ma ke passports with 
a visa to Costa Rica for five hundred dollar 

each passpor t.  And the uncle from United States gave us the money and we paid thousand five 

hundred.  But we could get a transit visa through Be
lgium, because there was no straight flights.  
There was no flight at all.  You have to go 
by train to Belgium.  A
nd from Belgium you could 
have gone to a flyer, a ship to Costa Rica.  
But when we came to Belgium, we re ma ined in 
Belgium.  And we stayed in 
Belgium for five years.   
 

Q: Were you originally planning on 
ma king the entire trip to Cost
a Rica or was your intention to 
just st ay in Belgium 
and not go any further? 
 

A: My intention was to stay in Belgium, but ev
en in Belgium I didn™t want to stay.  1948 when 
Israel was declared independent st
ate, I was doing everything possi
ble to go to Israel.  I said I 
don™t want– the uncle sent us papers, everything to go to the United States.  He wanted to pay 

for my studies here and to upkeep us until I make 
my diploma here, but I di
dn™t want to go to the 
United States.  I want to go home , because after a
ll I am Jewish.  There we have a state.  I don™t 
want anymore to be a stranger. 
 

Q: Did you ever consider making 
aliyah
 before Israel  was a 
state and going illegally? 
 

A: To be candid, we in our villages, it™s moremy ne phews, organized a Zionist organization.  And I 
was quasi a me mber of this organization.  Butmy brother was an active me mber and he even 

ma de 
ha-shorah
 
(ph )
.  He was a farmer and he wanted to 
go before the war.  But my mother, 
even before the war, some how she said, ﬁThere 
is no future in Poland for Jews, let us go to 
Israel.ﬂ  It wa s not yet Israel, 
st ill Palestine.  Said, ﬁYou are a far mer,ﬂ she said to father, ﬁand 
the farmers are well off there.ﬂ  It was anothe
r kind of farming there.  ﬁWe will make somehow 
money here from our farm.ﬂ  We could make th
en, that was a lot of mone y for our farm, ten 
thousand dollars.  With ten thousa
nd dollars in Israel you could do a 
lot, you could do a lot.  But 
my father said, ﬁNo, I don™t want.ﬂ  He was mu
c h older than my mother.  My mother was young.  

With so ma ny children he said, ﬁI™m sure it wi
ll be difficult and impossible to ma ke existence 
there.ﬂ  And he didn™t want to leave Poland.  He wa
s orthodox Jew.  He said, ﬁI will go to Israel 
when Messiah will come .ﬂ  No Zionists.  And my brother was prepared to go, but then there 

came the war and he couldn™t.  And so my nephews
 wanted to go and no one of them did it.

Tape 3, Side B 
 
Q: Okay, it™s now May 30, 2000, and we™re continuing 
our interview with Mr. Oscar Haber.  And 
why don™t we start by going back, you had talk
ed on the last tape 
about the day of your 
liberation.  And just to remi nd you, what you had 
talked about, we were, you talked about how 
afterwards you had me t up with some other Jews
 and you were singing some  old Yiddish songs.  
And then you described going back to your home t own 
and then back to Kr akow.  The thing that 
I wasn™t sure about, that I didn™t quite understa
nd is, did you immediately 
leave the town where 
you were after liberation?   And do you reme mbe r  
saying good-bye to the fa mily that you were 
staying with?    
 

A: Well, the question of liberation is one of the mo
st diffi cult time fr om all the past  problems which 
we had.  We  were, as I told you, living as Chri
stians.  And the liberation came.  We  c ouldn™t 
enjoy our liberation or country.  
It was the greatest shock and th
e most diffi cult mo me nt in our 
lives.  That was the liberation.  A
nd especially if I want to put it 
in perspective, the differences 
between people who survived camps and people w
ho lived on so-called Aryan papers was very 
different.  We have two things to overcome .  The 
fi rst is, which we had all the time, that was the 
fight for existence and how to survive, of cour
se.  And the next, when the liberation came  was 
the shock to find the reality.  You don™t ha
ve where to go.  You couldn™t find nobody you know, 
or anybody of your people.  You suddenly find y
ourself, you cannot stay in the place where you 
were.  We  were in a village, not in a town.  We
 were in a village.  A
nd if I– realize it was a 
hostage village.  They were not sympathetic to Je
wish survivors.  However I survived, not a Jew, 
but suddenly I felt that I am back a Jew.  But I c
ouldn™t officially declare it.  I had to stay on my 
Aryan papers.  And how to go and where to go?  Because to go to my other village where I was 

born there, I wasn™t sure that I will be accepte
d.  And I wasn™t sure to go to Krakow, for 

example, because I di dn™t have where to go.  
Even not where to sleep at night.  And you don™t 
have money.  And you don™t have nothing becaus
e whatever you had you have already sold out 
whatever you had.  So, that was the most terrible
 time in all this events which we had, the so-
called liberation was the terrible hit of the realit
y.  You were hit with the reality.  Not where to 
go and not what to do and how to start.  Will yo
u be accepted as a Jew?   You cannot go on and to 
say you are not a Jew, because really where 
you go they know you are Jew when you come  to 
the places where I used to live.  And to st
ay in a strange, foreign surrounding like we were 

before, so I have to stay like I 
was all the time, a peasant, a farmer.  To watch the horse and the 
cows.  In reality I was a dentist.  I want to go ba
ck.  I didn™t have nothing with me, but I have to 
go to start to look for our existence.  And as I said
 before already that part, I went to the village 

where I was born, and then later when they went w
ith us to Kr akow, all this trouble I have with 

Fryda and when I came to Krakow.  But the questi
on of this liberation, to
 explain it in a very 
simple term, that was the greatest shock of ev
erything together.  But when I came to Krakow, 
when I started to settle as I sai
d, I have been there, different pl
aces, st art to organi ze my life.  
And with the help of the uncle which came, we we
nt to Belgium as I said.  And in Belgium we 
became refugees.  We became as one of the United Nations refugees.  We regist ered there and I 

have my register card as a refugee from the Un
ited Nations.  And I got th
e permit because I had a 
visa only to stay there, transit 
vi sa to pass through Belgium.  But because I was recognized as a 
refugee, they gave me time to stay three months th
ere.  In three months I had to renew my stay in 
Belgium.  And we were under the auspicion of 
the foreign police, a special departme nt, the 
etranger 
(ph)
, police etranger.  And they gave 
us another stay of three months.

Q: Okay, before we go on into Belgium, I just wa
nted to ask another question about the liberation 
time.  I™ve forgotten the name  of the fa mily that
 was sheltering you right at
 the end of the war.  
What was their names? 
 

A: The Polish people? 

 

Q: Yeah. 

 

A: Soltys.  Soltys.  That was a woma n, a widow. 

 

Q: They were the ones in your hometown, right?   
But at the time of the liberation what was the 
name  of the woma n that you were staying? 
 

A: Oh that was a ma n, that was Muschau.  He 
was recognized as a righteous ma n, the righteous 
between people.  I gave him to Yad Vashem, and 
he is recognized.  He was a wonderful person.  

He helped us all the time, even the time  when he
 didn™t suspect us as Jews, he was all the time  
very human and very helpful. 
 

Q: I thought you were staying with 
his sister right there.  You were actually staying with him right 
at the end of the  war? 
 

A: We stayed with the si ster, but it was a very terrib
le accident.  The last, the last  bullet, the Russian 
bullet got his hand, his left hand.  Because his house was on the, on the border.  Where the front 

was standing between the Russians and the Germans and there was heavy fire because there was 

the Dunajec river.  And he was close to this rive
r, not far.  So he decided, the frontier between 
the Germans and the Russians, which was standing 
about four or five months was very close to 
this place.  And his house was under fire, so he deci
ded to come  to his sister pl ace, and while he 
opened the door, a bullet cut his left ha nd.  And 
he was bleeding and because he knew that the 
underground station, sanitary station was in my 
place, so he decided that the neighbor took him 
on a wagon and he brought him to me  there to gi
ve him first help.  And I cut him.  It was 
hanging on the skin, this hand.  I cut on this and 
I bind around that he doesn™t bleed out and I 
went back with him together and brought him 
to his house.  And there I found out a really 
surgeon doctor was hiding there in the underground ar
my and they brought him to this house.  I 
gave him the anesthesia, whichever 
it could be a little bit chlorofo
rm.  But most anesthesia was I 
gave him alcohol.  We ha d there moonshine, moonsh
ine.  And he was drinking so he was out of 
conscious.  And this surgeon bind him, all these vein
s and ar teries.  Fi rst of all, he cut him a little 
bit of this arm farther because it was alre
ady gangrenous, gangrene, because where I bound it 
there it st arted, it is very fast process.  He cut it 
there and bind all the arteries and veins and so he 
survived.  And then I di dn™t go more to the pl
ace of the sister, but I stayed with him and took 
care on him all the time .  So he survived and he 
was thankful to me  and I was very thankful to 
him.  So it was a very, very good occasion to
 serve this ma n, this very nice person. 
 

Q: Was Fryda with you then too?   With him?  

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0011
  
 
29
 
 
29
A: No, for the first two days she 
stayed still with the sister  ther
e.  But later on she came here, we 
brought here.  The front was standing there fo
r a mome nt.  There was a fight there.  The 
Germans run away.  They left only some  guns, au
toma tic shooters.  And these were not origin 
Germans.  This were Russians which were collaborated with the Germans.  And they were 
ma king the last fights with the German.  And ther
e in this house just, we were ther e.  The 
Germans caught the first Russian soldiers who came
 in, and they bind them together and they put 
a grenade between them and they kill them there, on the garbage there. 
 

Q: Did you see that happen? 

 

A: I saw it later, after I saw them there.  The 
Germans came in, you can come  take in the shoes if 
you need from this people.  And then the Germans 
escape, of course.  That was the end of this 
fight there.  And after several days
 we went there, to the sister th
ere.  We  took a little bit of what 
we had, our clothi ngs and we left there, from
 there.  And then we are looking on occasion 
some how to go to Krakow and to go to my village
 there and to organize this life like I said. 
 

Q: But even though the war had ended and you we
re supposedly liberated, you didn™t tell these 
people that you were Jewish? 
 

A: No, I didn™t tell them and for a long time 
they didn™t know, until– I 
don™t know exactly when 
they started to realize that I am Jewish.  But 
when the war passed my village where I was, the 
war continued.  It was January twenty-one a
nd the war was continued until, as you know, until 

May.  So here was all the time moving Russian truc
ks and arma ments and soldiers.  That was the 
only way, with the soldiers for a bottle of 
vodka, which we could have some  commuting to 
Krakow or to the other villages.  It was also
 very dangerous.  They
 were also not very 
sympathetic to Jews.  Some ti me s Fryda stand in the 
line to get a ri de to the village ther e for some 
food to these Polish people.  So there was standing 
a lot of people and wa iting for this ride.  So 
the Russian driver which was 
taking said, ﬁYou yes, you can go.  You yes, yes.  But you no, no 
Jews, no Jews, no Jews.ﬂ  Even the Russian soldie
r.  So there is no big difference between one 
and the other one. 
 

Q: So you really didn™t feel then that the Russians 
were any safer to live with than the Ge rmans had 
been? 
 

A: First of all, they didn™t realize who is 
a Jew or no, except that 
they really recognize by 
physiognomy, they saw it is a Jew.  And then in r
eality they were not mo re, well they didn™t have 
in their program to kill Jews.  That was indivi dual soldiers, some of them which were, I don™t 

know, they were from s o me  other nationality as
 Russians or Ukrainians
 or Belorussians or 
Lithuanians or Latvians.  There we
re all ki nds of soldiers there. 
 So that was more individual and 
then it was al so some times inspired by some  other anti-Semites to go to kill a Jew.  The Russians 

didn™t he sitate to kill a Jew, too.  However it 
came  in the Polish Army, which was a Polish unit 
in the Russian Army.  In this unit there were
 ma ny Jews, I me an for us, many– five was ma ny.  
Because we used already without Jews here in th
is side, the German side.  But there were some  
Jews and the times when the Jews didn™t 
hear, you could hear– I understand Russian and 

Ukrainian, too.  So, I could hear how they were 
expressi ng themselves anti-Semitic even to their 
offi cers and to thei r sergeants.  ﬁThese dirt y Jews,ﬂ a
nd so forth.  So this is the reality like it was.

Q: Okay, then you were saying a litt
le earlier about Belgium, then. 
 And you were there as refugees 
and you had to be registered. 
 

A: In this vi llage, I came to my village where I 
was origin.  And I told you 
already before in this 
story, that they send in so mebody to kill us.  And 
I didn™t go back there to my village anymore.  
Fryda went several time s for food, 
but she never slept there.  She 
went to the shtetl and in the 
shtetl were al ready three or four Jewish fa m
ilies.  And between them was one, my niece, she 
lived there.  She came there back
 to the shtetl ther e, and she ha
d already a room there and she 
slept with her.  And the next day she came back to
 Krakow.  When she left I wasn™t sure I will 
see her tomo rrow.  It was a difficult time even 
afte r the liberation.  Ev
en after the liberation. 
 

Q: You me ntioned last time about the group of peopl
e, the group of survivors that you were together 
with.  Wher e was that? 
 

A: That was already in Krakow.  We ll, you cannot
 say group, they for med a group.  They find each 
other and because one of them has a place, so we
 came there.  We  could there sleep at night.  
And with no soldier, we were sitting and singing 
old Yiddish songs because we couldn™t sleep.  
The horror on our heads was so terrible that we
 couldn™t sleep even.  Like taking, by the time, 

how to spend the time. 
 

Q: Were these people that 
you had known before the war? 
 

A: No, no, no.  I never knew.  I never knew these pe
ople.  I never knew these people.  That was only 
two or three days, until, as I told you, we find th
e place of my friends there, which they were 
already coming survivors from Ausc hwitz after 
the liberation.  Young people which were living 
together there.  Sleeping there 
on the floor for a time.  Someho
w that you have, because in the 
evening there was curfew.  You couldn™t go in the street, you have to be some place.  So that was 

the place where we could run away.  And that was a very happy occasion to go in. 
 

Q: Okay, do you want to skip ahead then and talk 
about Belgium?   Because we talked, that™s where 
we l e ft  off. 
 

A: Well when we came to Belgium.  We founded th
ere, because we came with Fryda™s father, he 
found there his brother, who survived in Antwerp. 
 And he used to live in Antwerp before the 
war and he was in Antwerp quite a known person. 
 He was in the diamond business.  And he was 

poor, but he already contact his 
other brother, younger brother in
 Holland, in England.  The 
youngest brother, who changed his na me  from 
Hi mmelblau to Hill.  And then he became  
recognized by the Queen as a British officer, d
ecorated.  And he already ma kes good business.  
He was quite already a rich ma n.  And he did he
lp him.  And also this uncle from the United 
States, he  opened us a place in Antwerp where we  can take  the money, how to survive our time.  

But I didn™t want to be supported. 
 I organize, even illegal, a lit
tle clinic, and I treated Jewish 
patients, refugees who came there.  And there wa
s a yeshiva, an orthodox 
yeshiva, which I treat 
without money this all students th
ere.  And I don™t know if I told you, one day came in a student.  
And you know whoever it come s you started to talk, ﬁWhere from are you?   How do you 

survive?   Where did you been? ﬂ   And there cam
e  in a yeshiva boy.  A nice, pretty wonderful

boy.  And I ask him, ﬁ Where are you from? ﬂ   And he said, ﬁWell, I am from Krakow.ﬂ  ﬁFrom 
Krakow?   We are also from Krakow.ﬂ  ﬁYes? ﬂ   He
 was happy to hear that 
we are from Krakow.  
ﬁ Where did you live in Krakow? ﬂ
  He said, ﬁWell in Diver 
(ph )
 Street, number four,ﬂ and this 
house was the Himmelblau house of the house of my
 wife™s fa mily.  And I reme mbered his 
father.  And Fryda knew his brothe
rs and sisters, they
 were living in the same  house for so ma ny 
years.  And he started to cry a
nd Fryda started to cry.  I called 
in Fryda.  In my clinic, I had a 
corner in my  bedroom where I put in an engine
, a foot engine and act
ually did the patients, 
some how.  But slowly I ma ke a living off it and I 
had a possibility to ma ke a decent living.  So, I 
stopped the help of my uncle.  I didn™t want to 
be supported.  In the meantime, as we have been 
there for close to two years, Israel was esta
blished.  And I was already connected with the 
Zionist organization there in Antwerp.  I was a me
mber of the committee there.  So I said, ﬁI 
want to go to Israel.ﬂ  Well, Fryda™s father didn™t
 want to go.  He preferre
d to stay in Antwerp.  
Well, he knew the languages and he had his brothe
r there and he had the support from this two 

brothers, so he decided he  will not go with us
.  In the meantime, our son was born.  He was 
already two years old. 
 

Q: What was his name ?  

 

A: Henry Edward.  He lives now in Texas, in Austin
, Texas.  He grew up in Israel.  My uncle from 
the United St ates sent us a visa and he even want
 us to come  to the United States.  And he™ll pay 
our upkeep, my studies, so that I 
will be independent and we can live in the United States.  But I 
found that our place, after all we survived and 
surpassed, my place is Israel.  This is the only 
place for a Jewish person to live.  That was my conviction.

Tape 4, Side A 
 
Q: This is tape number four, 
side A.  Did you, did you have, what
 kind of experience did you have 
in Belgium, just as far as– were you just work
ing all the time?   Or we
re you having any leisure 
time? 
 
A: Oh yeah, leisure time  enough.  And as I 
said, I wa s an active 
Zionist, too.  And–  
 

Q: How were you active?    

 

A: Well, organizing young people who came there, ma
ny refuge es from Poland, from Russia, from 
Germany.  They start to come  fr
om a ll places there.  And then 
they came from Israel.  There was 
the Israel  soldiers which are serving in the Bri
tish Ar my.  The y were in Europe and Germany and 
everywhere there was fighting against the Germans.
  And they are the people who helped us to 
organize the people to go to Israel.  And quite a 
number of them went to Israel.  Some of them 
remained in Belgium, some went to Australia, so
me went to America.  But as I later heard, many 
of these young people who went to Israel became soldiers, even they were unexperienced 

soldiers, only to fight for freedom.  And most of th
em were killed in this fight because  they were 
not experienced soldiers.  But Israel need everyone
 there in this time.  It was a very hard time  
there in Israel, too.  And when I decide we 
are going, we organize.  We  brought everything, 
because in Israel we knew there is nothing, refr
igerator s and the stove, furniture, hardware, what 
we need for the kitchen for a living.  We took ev
erything.  We  took several lifts and we went to 
Marseilles by train.  And from Marseilles we went by boat, by the Kadma 
(ph )
.  It was quite a 
nice boat.  And that was my son™s second birthda
y on this ship.  The captain ma ke him a party, 
well, kind of party, a reception for our son there. 
 
Q: What was the date? 
 

A: That was April the 6
th
.  My son was born April the 6
th
.  So, we left Marseilles April the 5
th
. 
 

Q: 1948? 

 

A: 1948.  No, 1951, excuse me .  1951, because ‚49 our 
son was born.  When Fryda was pregnant we 
didn™t want  to go for this experience.  We  were
 waiting that he will be able to make this 
transport.  In April of ‚51 we left for Israel. 
 We  were so far fortunate that our friend from 
Antwerp, who is also from Krakow, left for Israel 
a year before us.  And he rented a house there 
with two bedrooms, a kitchen, a bathroom.  And they invited us that we would be able to stay 

with them for the first day until we find a place to stay.  Because that  was no other way.  And we 

came to them, we stayed with them.  And the lift 
arrived.  There was a yard there, we could put 
the lift there.  We  were searching for an apartm
ent.  And we rented an apartment, which was a 
living room and a bedroom, a hall, a k
itchen and a bathroom.  That was all. 
 

Q: What town was this in? 

 

A: Pardon? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0011
  
 
33
 
 
33
Q: Whattown? 
 

A: Givataim, a suburb of Tel Aviv.  
We  didn™t want to go to Tel Aviv. 
 First of all, it™s a big town 
and everybody was going to Tel Aviv.  And that wa
s a settlement which was in development and 
that was, to compare, a little bit cheaper.  A
nd I di dn™t ha ve enough money to buy an apartment.  
We rented an apartment.  And we organized there.
  I organized in these three rooms, the hall was 
the waiting room, the bedroom was the clinic.  And there was a bed which was in the day, closed 

like a cabinet.  In the day I could accept patients
.  And the living room was the bedroom for us.  
We were sleeping there in the bedroom.  And the 
child was there.  There was a terrace.  It was 
nice.  After working there about two years we re
nted, just close, became free another big room 
and a kitchen and a little hall.  
So we rented this, and– excuse me
.  We bought it.  I bought it.  
In the meantime I bought this apartment where you 
are renting.  I bought this apartment.  And I 
made of both of them one bigger apartment a
nd a separate clinic.  And life became more 
comfortable.  We  organized a very nice apar
tment and a very nice living in this room. 
 

Q: When you said you came to realize that the only 
place that you as a Jew could be at ho me  was in 
Israel, what had happened after the wa r that ma de you come  t o that conclusion? 
 

A: Well ma ybe it is not known in the world and pe
ople are more concentrated on Poland and Polish 
anti-Semites in Germany.  But Belgium, which 
seems to be more sympathetic to the Jewish 
case– in Antwerp, where there was quite a number of Jews, when you were looking for an 

apartment for rent, it was in the windows written, ﬁNot for foreigners.ﬂ  And that meant not for 

Jews.  In some  of the apartments was written 
exactly what I said, ﬁNo Jews.ﬂ  And I in the 
meanti me  learned to speak Flemish, which was 
the language in Antwerp, because Brussels was 
more French.  But Antwerp was Flandria.  That
 was the the part of– Belgium has two nations, 
Valonia and Flandria.  The Fla
ndrians were more, more German sympathetic.  They we re 
German oriented.  Valonians were more French
 oriented.  And Jews which were saved in 
Belgium, they mostly were more saved in this 
part which was Valonian. 
 In Flandria there was 
impossible to survive.  We ca me , rented an apar
tment.  And still we we
re all the time renting 
there.  And that was a nice apartment.  We  l
ove it.  And the admi nistrator showed us the 
apartment and the conditions wher
e it was not expensive.  It wa
s nice and the place was nice.  
And when it came to write the lease, he says, 
ﬁYes, but you are not strangers.ﬂ  And we said, 
ﬁYes, we are strangers.  We are from Poland.ﬂ 
 And he said, ﬁBut you ar
e not Jews? ﬂ   I said, 

ﬁYes, we are Jews.ﬂ  So, ﬁI am sorry, I have inst
ructions from my– I am not the owner, from the 
owner, no Jews.  I am sorry, no Jews.ﬂ  And that 
gave me  a lot to think about it.  Around you see 
no friends, no friendly, no foreigners, no Jews.  So
 that means there is no place to live here for 

the Jews.  However there is a lot Jews remained th
ere and lived there.  They
 didn™t care about it.  
But I was, I don™t know, personally more sensitive 
realizing this problem.
  I said, ﬁNo, I don™t 
want to be, that can happen the same  everywhere
.ﬂ  And therefore I decided to go home.  I said, 
ﬁThat™s the one place where nobody would tell me as
 a Jew you have to live.  You ha ve all the 
rights.ﬂ  And that
 was the reason. 
 

Q: Was there a particular orga
nization that you were working w
ith in Brussels?   A Zionist 
organization? 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0011
  
 
34
 
 
34
A: Yeah, it was the general Zionist moveme nt. 
 General Zi onist move me nt.  Not labor, not 
revisionist, general Zionist.  
That was in this time a ge
neral Zionist organization.   
 
Q: You me ntioned in your last 
interview, I believe, that you had spent some time studying in 
Germany as well.  Was that, did that
 happen after you had gone to Israel? 
 

A: Yes.  After I became involved in my profession. 
 In the dent al associa
tion I became one of the 
active me mbers in the ma nage me nt  of the or
ganization.  I became vice-president of the 

organization of the dental association in Israel. 
 And because a big part of Jewish dentists in 
Israel, their origin was countries where they 
spoke German.  If it was Czechoslovakia, even 
Poland, they spoke more  German than Yiddish, or even Yiddish, they could understand German.  

And there was a necessity, there was not world litera
ture in He brew in this
 profession.  And we 
were interested as these peopl
e became more educated and more
 acquainted in the profession, 
which ma de progress terrible.  
Progress during the five years a
nd then later on and on all the 
time.  And there was English literature, which th
e people didn™t know.  I s
poke already a little bit 
English, but not enough to be fluent 
in literature or to give a lect
ure in English.  The University 
has some  professors which were lecturing in Eng
lish.  But for the mass, I mean for the majority 
of the dentists it wasn™t understa
ndable.  So we needed German-s
peaking lectures.  And time by 
time, we start to br ing in from Ger many lecturer
s, professors.  And so I became acquainted with 
these professors.  And we started to exchange 
normal relations between them.  So we started 

organize even at the universities in Ge rmany, 
some  courses for the occasion, for progress, for 
professional progress.  So we ma ke a course in 
Bonn.  We  ma ke a course in Berlin.  We ma ke a 
course in Munich.  We  ma ke a course in Marbur
g on the Lahn.   It was in Frankfurt also some  
courses.  Some from ti me to time there were a 
group of twenty, thirty people who can afford it, 
who are going only for education ther
e.  And that was the reason.  And so I went with this group 
there.  And I went to Bonn where I stayed fo
r three months there. 
 And I ma ke my, my 
graduation doctor there in Bonn a
nd then Marburg.  That was the two universities.  Marburg was 
a general university and 
Bonn was only a dental school.  So he
re we got a dental license as a 
dental practitioner license and 
here you ma ke your doctor up in
 Marburg.  So you are a doctor 
and a dentist, both of it. 
 

Q: So up until that point  you hadn™
t actually been a doctor until you–? 

 

A: No, I haven™t been a doctor until
 this time.  I be only a dentist,
 a licensed dentist in Poland.  A 
licensed dentist in Poland. 
 

Q: And how did it feel to, as a Jew, to be doing 
these studies in Germany aft e r what had happened? 
 

A: In general, the staff of the university, of 
each of these universities, they we re very, very 
forthcoming and they were very ge ntle and very willingl y to help us.  Even we knew that some  

of them were with a Nazi past.  The more Nazi 
they were before the war or during the war, the 
more forthcoming they were afte
r the war.  They didn™t know, th
ey said, about anything what 
happened before.  And they were alwa ys good wi
th Jews and they had good relations and even 
there at the university
 there were professors Jews and so fort
h.  In Bonn, for example, the head of 
the school was Professor Kirkhaus, which was know
n that he was a me mber
 of the Nazi party.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0011
  
 
35
 
 
35
And he was the first one who quit the Jewish prof
essor who was there.  I don™t reme mber this 
moment what his name was.   
 

Q: So you™re there for three months and you™re 
studying in a German university.  Did you feel 
angry?   Or did you form any fr
iendships with any Germans?  
 

A: I can hardly say that you were angry, because
 nobody forced you to go.  You have to, to have 
your attitude, you come  t here, you have to accept 
the reality.  Of course, you knew exactly that 
you are stepping on the burning ground.  You know 
this is not the pl ace where you should be.  
But it is not only there.  You star
t to think with the re
al terms even then already.  This is the 
reality of life and this is the future of life. 
 If you want to separate and if you want to be 
some body else, chosen for some thing.  There is
 no place for you on this world.  You have to 
accommodat e  it to the future life.  And this is th
e future life.  This is the future.  Now you see 
what happens.  Israel has relations with Germany, with France.  However we know there are still 

a lot of anti-Semites.  And they 
are everywhere.  They are everyw
here.  But they are not because 
they are special anti-Semites.  Th
ere are anti-blacks, there are anti-yellows, there are anti-Asians, 
there are anti, all kinds of antis. 
 This is the reality of the wo
rld now.  You know, it some times is 
for me  diffic ult to accept the gene
ral view of the Jewish world 
about the Polish anti-Se mites, 
about Poland.  I born in Poland.  I got my educati
on in Poland.  I lived there.  And I was a Polish 
patriot.  And so were ma ny, the ma jority.  Ther
e were some J ews which didn™t accept never that 
they are Poles.  And to sa y that the Poles were
 all anti-Semites, I will 
not put this category, put 
them in this categor y.  There were some intere
sts.  And people are behaving very often, very 

different in different situations
.  But to say a priori all the Polish ar e anti-Semites, it is 
exaggerated.  It™s not true.  It
™s not true.  But the same  you can
 say about Jews.  They are anti-
Arabs, they are anti-Poles or anti-this.  There 
are Jews who are anti-Jew
ish.  Everything exists.  
But ma inly I don™t know how to categ
orize it, even with my most 
sophisticated thinking, I think 
in every human body there is some anti, some anti.  
Anti- this, anti-him, anti,
 is it anti-blacks or 
some  blacks?   Or anti-yellows or just some  ye
llows?   Anti-Asians.  There is in every huma n 

being, there is an anti.  But you have to come  
to some point that you ar
e living in this world, 
which is very differentiated and if you will not
 accept this, there is no pl ace for you.  Because 
every day brings surprises.  We
 are not done with wars.  We  a r e not done with discrimi nations.  
It was, it is and it will 
be forever, forever.   
 

Q: When you fi rst moved to Israel did you feel, 
I me an there you were among your own people, did 
you feel a sense of relief or a sense of 
being at home  as you had hoped to feel?    
 

A: Well, this question is a very 
sensitive question.  When you came to
 Israel, how difficult it is to 
say, there was a gap between these 
born Israelis, long living in Isr
ael and newcomers in Israel.  
Like everywhere, a st ranger gets feeling of a 
stranger.  You are a stranger for a while until you 
are not accommodating to the reality.  And then
 some gap, some gap, it is sixty years after 
establishment of Israel state, fifty-two years, 
but there™ s still differen
ces between born Israelis, 
longest living Israelis an
d new comi ng Israelis.  Is it good?  
It is reality.  I don™t know.  I don™t 
know.  Maybe it is human nature.  It™s this 
kind of jealousy.  But in the beginning when you 
came in, the feeling was a little bit 
different, because a lot of people 
in Israel, living in Israel, not 
born in Israel, but living in Isr
ael for ma ny years, who were the elite in Israel, came from Poland, 
Russia, ma ybe Czechoslovakia.  Some  ca me  from 
Ger many, too.  Zionists.  They felt the elite, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0011
  
 
36
 
 
36
and you felt when you came in with a feeling how
 could you survive?   You must have done 
some thing which is not right, that you could surv
ive the Holocaust.  Because my parents, my 
uncle, my grandparents, my brothe
r, my sister, they were kill
ed.  Everybody.  Nobody is here.  
And you survive.  You must be guilt of some thing.  You have to feel this guilt. 
 

Q: Did people actually say that to you? 

 

A: I heard it.  It wasn™t meant ma ybe special straight
 to me , but I heard it.  I 
heard it in a quite clear 
voice.  These people who survive, they were colla
borating with the Germans.  And that gave you 
a very, very strange feel
ing, very bad feeling.   
 

Q: Will you say a little bit more about how you dea
lt with that?   I me an 
you ha d such high hopes of 
finding a place where you would really be at
 home.  Did you, how did you deal with it? 
 

A: I was maybe  more fortunate than the majority of
 this newcomers.  First of all, because I was 
involved in the Zionist organiza
tion and secondly because I knew 
the language.  And that gave 
me  a very great advantage not to be singled 
out.  That was worse with people who couldn™t 
communicate.  And they had to communicate in 
other language, which was in Yiddish or in 
German, and the Israeli-born children didn™t speak 
Yiddish.  They didn™t wa
nt to speak Yiddish.  
I think they™re quite chauvinistic.  I think they ar
e quite chauvinistic.  And the same  thing can be 
said about the long living in Isr
ael.  They were ma ybe not so cha
uvinistic as they were the best 
one, the good one.  ﬁWe came here and we built this
 country.  We  fought for this country and we 
gave us a country.ﬂ  You know, that
 was also a very strange feeli
ng.  A very strange feeling.  But 
with the time you got used to all ki
nd of treatme nt in your society.

Tape 4, Side B 
 
Q: This is tape four, side B.  Who were your fr
iends then, mostly other refugees when you were in 
Israel?   
 

A: It™s not only me , but usually 
people are always closer to th
eir landsme n.  Comi ng from Poland, 
get with the Polish people.  Co
mi ng from Hungary, are living with 
the Hungarians because of the 
language.  I cannot say.  We ha
d people from different, from Hungary, from Romani a, from 
Czechoslovakia, from Germany.  And in reality, 
the most educated people which we met in 
Israel, which were the leading inte
lligentsia in Israel, they we re 
original from these countries.  
From Ger many, comi ng from Ger many.  Because the 
aliyah
 which came to Israel from the Arab 
countries, they were me rchandise mostly.  Very, ve
ry, very few which were professionals.  They 
all business me n, all handy people, ma king something 
for a living.  But in ge
neral, there were the 
poor people who ca me , that were the first who came  
into Israel.  That was the big problem.  They 
didn™t have the language and they 
didn™t have the– for them life was very difficult when they 
came poor.  So there was difficult for apartment. 
 They built temporary sh
elters for them.  And 
they were living in these shelters for several ye
ars until they so mehow came out there.  There are 
some  of them living until toda y.  Some  of th
e m built houses on the places where the shelter 
houses were.  They allowed them to build, so th
ey gave them– because most of the land were 
belonging to the Keren Kaye me th.  
So they allowed them, t hese pe
ople to settle on this places 
because the governme nt wasn™t able to give them
 stable living.  So there are some  slobs until 
today and there are some  which built nice houses
.  And of course, with the time, the new 
generation there went to school a
nd they ma ke progress.  And a lot of them ca me  with their 
religious leaders, with their Rabbis.
  And then they settled in thei
r own circles.  And this is now 
Israel™s greatest problem, is their religious Orthodox problem.  With the Se phardic, Sephardic 

those are those, Sephardic in reality means the 
Spanish people.  They don™t have nothing to do 
with Spanish, except maybe their ancestors came 
from Spain.  But generally they are Arabic 
Jews and they learn quite fast, Hebrew.  And they
 arrange their life very 
nice.  And they ma ke 
terrible progress, very, very nice progress.  But the problem of Israel is not solved and will never 

be solved in my opinion.  That™s war– my son, 
for example, was in two big wars, in the Six-
Day Wa r and the Yom Kippur Wa r.  
And  that was one of the ma in reasons that he left Israel.  
He said he had enough of wars, when he came to
 the United States for studying his business, so 
he found that he would be better here.  And he 
stayed here.  And therefore we are here.  We  
came after him, otherwise we wouldn™t be here in 
the United St ates.  I would be here in Israel 
until today.  And I™m not  sorry that I did it, because
 I™m not sorry of one st ep in my life.  I don™t 

look backwards.  I take the reality.  I am here 
happy.  I live happy.  And so is my son.  I have two 
grandchildren.  My granddaughter graduated now from the University here in Kentucky.  But she 

lives also to Austin, Texa s, where my son lives. 
 And our grandson is in Virginia Beach.  So now 

we are without children and wit
hout grandchildren, but we have 
here very good friends.  And we 
are happy here, ma king our life here. 
 

Q: When your son was growing up in Israel did he
 ask you about your past and about the Holocaust 
years?   Or did you tell him about what had happened there? 
 

A: Well the fi rst years, I my self couldn™t talk about it, neither  coul d my wife.  And she is until today 
not so outspoken.  And for her the language barrier 
in Israel was very diffi
cult, very difficult.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0011
  
 
38
 
 
38
She learned the daily language, but usually she 
couldn™t live a cultural lif
e, except going to 
concert and eventually fro m time to time with me  to
 the theater.  But usually it was a ba rrier for 
her.  But we have a society where she could 
speak Polish, where she could speak German.  And 
we had very wonderful company, very good friends
.  And then concerning our son, it came when 
he went to school, to elementary school.  He aske
d in the first grade, he asked about whether we 
could help him with something in
 his home work.  And mother told him, ﬁI™m sorry but go to 
Father because I don™t know.ﬂ  So he ask a ve
ry simple question, ﬁMom, did you ever go in your 
life to school? ﬂ  So it is difficult to say that 
we spoke with him about 
the Holocaust because it 
was a painful thing to go on to put it on your chil
dren.  But of course when he growed up, when 
he went to hi gh school and later on to military,he  realized what happened and he aske d some  
questions.  But not too ma ny, not 
too ma ny, not too ma ny.  And I think until we came here, to the 
United States, he learned more
 about all of this than 
all his staying in Israel. 
 

Q: So it wasn™t so much a part of cultural life in 
Israel then to even talk 
about it, even though it™s a 
society mostly composed of Jews?   Pe ople weren™
t, the children weren™t 
being taught necessarily 
about what had happened in Europe with
 the Nazis™ extermination of Jews? 
 

A: Well, I, I cannot agree with th
is what you ask for.  My culture life in Israel was very, very 
developed.  First of all in the professional way 
because I was very active 
in my profession and I 
studied a lot.  And except of which I went to c
oncert and I went to theat
er , al l  Jewi sh theat er , I  
mean Hebrew theater.  I understood 
and I could take it.  And then 
I had a very rich library in 
Hebrew language and I was readi
ng in Hebrew and for me  Hebrew 
became  my, really to say, my  
first, or my second language if I would say the 
trut h, because the first always rema ins the Polish 
language which you have 
your basic education. 
 

Q: My question was more about whether your son, y
our son was– or even in this, I would ma ybe 
have guessed that in the schools 
he would have been taught about
 the Holocaust because he™s 
living in Israel.  But from what 
you™re saying it sounds as if ther
e was not very much talk about 
the Holocaust. 
 

A: You are right.  In the first ma ybe ten years th
ere was no talk about the Holocaust.  Later on bit by 
bit it came out and they start to open more th
e world and exchange of knowledge of the world, 
with all other countries in Europe and the Unite
d States.  And the Jews from the United States, 
tourists used to come , fa mily me mbers looking, s
earching for fa mily and some  of the m finding.  
And there was always exposed to the Israeli inform
ations in the papers and everywhere that was 
always the corner, the sensitive corner of Jewish life, to fi nd families, far families and fa milies 

and friends from shtetl.  Here they found a sist
er, here they found a br
other after not knowing 
that they survived, because they di sappeared and 
they went to different corners of the world, to 
Australia or to New Zealand a
nd to Africa and wherever you wa
nt, you have everywhere people 
in the world.  So when they start to come  some how
 together it was more exposed in the reality of 
course, with this knowledge it came  always 
a history and development of knowledge about 
Holocaust, how it came to it, and this opened the 
door to more knowledge about the Holocaust.   
 

Q: How long did you live, oh, here™s what I want
ed to ask you.  How segregated were you from 
your Arab neighbors?   Di d you have 
any interaction with them at all?   Or were your lives just 
completely separate?

A: My personal life was never involved with
 any Arabs.  With any ____________ Arabs, I didn™t 
know.  We ll, I can say that I knew nothing, but fro
m the press and visiting to go to the South to 
Beersheba and passing so me  villages where Arabs 
was living going to Nazareth.  If you go to see 
the country, you me t the Arabs and 
their way of living.  
But in my place where I lived there was 
no Arabs at all.  At th
at given time  there was no Arabs.  In
 Tel Aviv, for example, there was a 
section which was Jaffa, the port of Jaffa, the 
old port of Jaffa is the oldest port in the 
Mediterranean.  There are living Arabs until today.  The majority of them are Arabs and they are 

Christian Arabs and there are Musl im Arabs.  Ther
e are chur ches, there are mosques.  So when 

you are going to Tel Aviv, because there is no
t separation between Tel Aviv and Giva taim, 
Givataim was on the rand 
(ph )
 of Tel Aviv, that™s like a suburb 
of Tel Aviv.  And then when you 
want to go for a good meal, you went to Jaffa there. 
 Good restaurants.  Were
 Arab restaurants.  
And Oriental Jews opened oriental
 restaurants.  So this is th
e way where you came together with 
the Arab world.  You want to go to buy some  fres
h fish in the harbor there.  So you could buy it 
at Arab fishers there.  There were Jewish fish
ers, too.  But generally we didn™t have any, any, 
any connection and live together with the Arabs. 
 We knew fr om the press and we knew from the 
me dias how they live and where they live and 
what their problems are, but we didn™t have 
nothing in common, not hing in common.  You c a me  to
 Jerusalem, of course, after the Liberation, 
I mean after the Six-Day War there,
 western part of Israel, or Jeru
salem which they annected.  So 
you learned some thing.  When you came to Jeru
salem before when it was divided, you came 
always to the gate, where we saw the Arabs here
.  It was alwa ys a danger to approach close 
because there were shootings. 
 

Q: When did you first go back to visit Poland? 

 

A: I went to Poland after, to be
 exact, about after fifty years. 
 

Q: Fifty? 

 

A: After fifty years I went to Poland.  
The second time I went after three years. 
 

Q: So it was about 1995 that you first we nt to Poland? 

 

A: Some thing like this, yes. 

 

Q: Will you talk about that, that trip?   

 

A: We decide to go, when the parents of our good fr
iends which live here in Kentucky came  to visit 
here.  It was a very old Krakow fa mily which 
knew the business of Fr
yda™s parents and he by 
hims elf helped one Jew to survive.  And they 
are very, very nice peop
le. We met them and 
became friendly, very friendly.  They really embraced
 us and they asked us to come  to Poland, to 
be their guest s there.  And to see, you will see 
it is not so bad.  Just try, come  and you will see 
your sights.  That was one thing.  The other th
ing was we wanted to see our savior, this 
Muschau, who got his righteous papers there, and 
his family.  We wanted to see him because he 
was older than we are and we wanted to see him 
a live still.  We supported him from Israel.  We 
were sending parcels and money from time to 
time.  And we  supported him and he was very 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0011
  
 
40
 
 
40
thankful.  They were not rich people, very poor peasants.  And he also wrote us that he  will be 
happy to see us.  So we decided we will go, we wi
ll see how it is.  We  went  there and as I told 

you ma ybe before, I was a me mber of Rotary Inte
rnational in Israel and I became a me mber of 
Rotary here in Lexington, too.  And as a Rota
rian you are obliged to visit a club wherever you 
go.  You should go to meet.  Rotary have to co
me  together, whoever it is.  The Rotary in 
principle, Rotary has to have the best people.  
That™s what the principle 
of Rotary is.  And we 
went there to see Rotary in Krakow on their 
me e ting.  And one of the me mbers was a Jesuit 
priest, who was a professor at the University th
ere.  And he was a doctor of biology and a doctor 
of philosophy.  A very bright person.  After I had 
my speech there, at Rotary they are always 
asking guest Rotarian to give his 
impression and his greetings from 
his club to bring there.  He 
came to me , and we became  very friendly, very fri
endly.  So that even when I came back to the 
United States, we were writing to each other.  
I have ma ybe fifty letters from hi m, whi c h he 
wrote to me  and I wrote to him exchanging of 
some  ideas.  He was very fond of the Jewish 
religion and of Judaism.  Which I, I have stud
ied a lot about Judaism, biblical Judaism and 
Talmudic Judaism.  So I could give him some ans w
ers.  We  had some  very, very interesting talks 
about this subject.  We  had a very
 good time there.  We  went ther
e to the village.  One of our 
Polish friends which we became friendly, he visited here with the University of Kentucky for a 

year.  We became friendly and he invited to visit 
him in Krakow.  And he went with hi s car with 
us to these villages where we used to be in hidi
ng there.  And we went there and me t the people.  
There was a very exciting experience.  And we 
really enjoyed to see this everythi ng fr om 
perspective, it gives us some  good 
fe eling that we  could do it.  And therefore we went for the 
second time, too. 
 

Q: Had you kept in touch with a
nybody in Poland apart from Muschau? 

 

A: Yes, we saw Muschau for hims elf. 
 
Q: No, had you kept in touch with 
anyone other than Muschau during 
the years that you
 were not in 
Poland?  
 

A: No, no, not at all, not at all, 
not at all.  Except these people here from the United States which we 
me t here and this people who visited here and th
e Jesuit priest which we
 visited, otherwise we 
didn™t have. 
 

Q: So, Mrs. Soltys or her son, did you see them? 

 

A: Oh yeah, we saw them.  We saw both sons.  Th
ey were, well, they were very touched.  Madame  
Soltys didn™t live anymore, she was gone.  The 
second time we were even the Soltys son, the 
oldest son pa ssed away, too.  Only the youngest 
son, Kazimi erz Soltys, which writes us until 

today and we send him from ti me to time some money.  Otherwise no.  
 

Q: What about, there were people who, I assume  
you had left Poland and they didn™t know at the 
time that you were Jewish, but you were friendl
y with them, such as the people who hid you.  
Did you have any encounters with people like that? 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0011
  
 
41
 
 
41
A: No, I didn™t meet more people.  I will tell
 you, I didn™t want these people to have different 
feelings, that  I was Jewish and they couldn™t kno
w and could even help me , maybe they will be 
sorry that they did it.  
I don™t want to put them in this c
onflict.  I don™t know.  You can never 
know huma n thinkings, huma n spirits, human so
ul.  You never know.  I don™t want to hurt 
people. 
 
Q: But overall your visit was 
very good it sounds like.   
 

A: Yes, my visit was very good.  Short.  Very good. 
 We ll, we experienced one a very, very peculiar 
experience while we were walking in Krakow.  In
 the market place, in the most important place 
in Krakow, in the most beautiful place in Kra
kow and I am not sure th
at the person who did it 
knew that we are Je wish and it wasn™t directed to
 us.  I think because this person run away from 
the ma rket, screaming, ﬁDeath to the Jews.ﬂ  And 
that was a very, very strange feeling, very, 
very strange feeling.  I couldn™t blame my fr
iends.  I couldn™t blame nobody.  Maybe some  
crazy.  You never know what people are 
able to do and who they are.

Tape 5, Side A 
 
Q: This is tape number five, si
de A of an interview with Oscar Haber.  And you wanted to me ntion 
about your visit? 
 

A: Because I wa s talking about Krakow, about th
e unpleasant what happens to me, I will try to 
ma ke some  r e ma rks about the Sharoka 
(ph )
 which is called the high st
reet.  And there is the 
oldest synagogue in Europe, called before the wo
rld the Alte Shul.  And 
there is now a Jewish 
museum.  There is another thing there on this stre
et, which is one of the 
oldest, ma ybe oldest too, 
ma ybe in the same  time.  I don™t know exactly.  
The Re mu Shul, the shul which is name d a fter 
Reb Isserls, which was a Rabbi in Krakow in the,
 I guess it was in the fi ft eenth century if I am 
not wrong.  There is still a shul 
and there are still Jews comi ng and there is a mi nyan and praying 
in Shabbas.  And they™re of course comi ng curious
.  And there is always a meeting of J e ws who 
come  visit Krakow.  They are always comi ng there. 
 And the site of this 
shul is the old cemetery 
which a gravestone of this famous Rabbi, Rabbi I
sserls.  They called the shul and they called the 
Rabbi ﬁRemu™.  Rabbi Moshe Isserls.  About him,
 used to say, ﬁFrom Mos e s, to Moses was not 
like Moses Isserls.ﬂ  Wa s a very great Rabbi, w
ho corrected one of the main Jewish religious 
books, the 
Shulchan Aruch
, on which the Jews, the We stern Jews
 were living their daily life.  
That was incl uded ever y point of life fr om the Je
ws.  But I will go back to the museum.  There 
are remnants from Jews in Krakow.  There were
 several severed Torahs, 
Bibles, and all kind of 
religious utilities.  And last but
 not least, there are ma ny photos 
of old Jewish life in Krakow.  
And we were there for a Shabbat prayer at the 
Remu Synagogue which I me ntioned before.  And 
there were a mi nyan, there were even a group 
of young students from Canada came to visit 
Poland and they were visiting this
 shul and sitting a
ll the pray and praying.  And another thing 
which is to see of Jewish life, ther e is a Jewish cultural center on the Meilzel 
(ph )
 Street.  A 
foundation of Canadian Jew, a _______________, and there 
are also kind of all 
Jewish life in the 
past and the present Jewish life.
  And they are cultural meetings.  There are comi ng wr iters and 
meeting there and presenting their 
books.  And there are Jewish books 
there in this unit there.   
 

Q: Did seeing all of this inspire 
you at all to, to think 
about the possibility of Jewish life continuing 
in Poland?   Did you ever consider
 living there yourself again? 
 

A: To answer this question is not 
easy.  From a historical
 point of view I™m s ure Jews will live in 
Poland.  First of all because of the root, of theroots.  It ma y be even second, third, fourth and 

fifth generation, they have their Jewish ballast, if
 you want to say, which asks them to go back to 
the sources.  This is one thing.  The second thing 
is, of the globalization of the world.  The world 
is globalizing.  It has united Europe.  In another 
few years if it will continue this way there will 

no be borders between European countries.  It 
will be a united Europe 
and Jews are living in 
Europe and will live in Europe.  We  have the best
 example, Spain.  The Jews were dr iven in the 

fifteenth century from Spain and there are Jews li
ving there.  There is a 
Jewish life in Spain.  
And there will be  everywhere.  There is Jewish 
life in Germa ny.  We may not like it.  We may 
not want it.  But life is stronger 
than all our views.  May it be po
litical, philosophical, whatever it 
is, life has his right.  Bread is eas
ier.  Where life is easier, people
 will alwa ys go.  And that™s my 
view.  Maybe I™m wrong.  I don™t know.  But I am su
re and I know that the last visit of the Pope 
in Israel gives a great contribu
tion to some how living together, Ca
tholics and Jews.  It is ma ybe 
ironic that in general even in the United Stat
es, people, Jewish people in general are more 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0011
  
 
43
 
 
43
involved in general Christianity, maybe less in
 Catholic.  Because there is a mi nority of 
Catholics.  But Poland is ninety percent Cathol
ics.  And the Pope, his origin is Wa dowice in 
Poland.  And he was during the war behaving as a 
fellow Semite.  And he now with his visit in 
Israel and his approach to the problem of Jewi
shŒChristian connection, 
I think opens more the 
door for Jews to go back to Poland.  Maybe I am wr
ong, ma ybe I am right.  It is still a stereotype 
of American Jews which have a guilty feeling th
at they didn™t do nothing, 
nothing in time  of the 
Holocaust to help thei r br others.  That  they 
ar e putting all the guilt of the Holocaust on Polish 
people.  I know the truth is that the ma jority of
 extermination, gas chambers and so forth was in 
the Polish territory.  But I find my ve ry answer, I 
think the ma in reason is that it was much easier 
for the Germans to make it where the biggest  con
centration of the Jews were.  There was, in 
Poland was more Jews than all over the world.  So
 instea d to go to Holland or to go to Belgium 
or to go to Germany, of c ourse they di dn™t want  to take them because they were ashamed to 
bring the Jews to Germa ny.  So I me an to this ot
her little countries, to br ing million of Jews it 
was for them i mpossible.  Impossible.  Physical
ly it was impossible.  
Maybe it would be good if 
they had come to this idea.  But their idea was to do this fast, fast and mo re able to do it was in 

Poland  That™s my opinion.  Maybe I am wrong, but 
that is the reason.  And of course, there is 
some thing to it that in Poland were no ma ny objecti
on to it.  But there is
 another answer, Poland 
was the biggest country of this 
all occupied territories except 
France.  But France has its own 
Anti-Semitic history, so we can put
 it in another perspective. 
 

Q: So, if you knew that you had another hundred ye
ars to live, could you co
nceive of living in 
Poland, moving back to Poland for part of that? 
 

A: It is like I said, it™s
 a very, very difficult answer.  Maybe 
yes, ma ybe no.  The yes is I would like 
to be the first one, not the sec
ond, not the third, not the fifth.  Bu
t if I live fifty years and there 
will be a community of a million Jews, I am not  sure if I would not prefer to live in Poland.  We ll 
of course, my first priority is Israel, but I don™
t know what will happen to Israel in the next 
future.  I am very worrying and it is one of my 
greatest pains to think about, about a bad outcome  
of this situation.  I don™t want to be a prophet a
nd I don™t want to put my words in tapes or in 
history.  But I am very afraid of 
the, what happens in Israel.   
 
Q: How do you feel about life in the United States? 

 

A: It is the same question 
like you ask me  be fore.   
 

Q: Hard to answer? 

 

A: If I am living in the United States, it is the mo
st wonderful place to live.
  If you ask me  to live 
between Jews and the United States, I am not comf
ortable with it.  I was more comfortabl e in 
Jews to live in Israel or to live 
in Poland.  And there is a reason to
 it and it is very difficult to 
raise out from history the past a
nd the relations between American 
Jews and world Jewry at all.  
It is a very difficult task.  And 
even now, with their best will, w
ith their greatest contribution to 
Israel Šwhich is a feeling of guilt, of courseŠthe relations between old American Jews and the 

new American Jews, except this which became ve
ry rich and involved in commerce and science 
and so forth, but the Jewish 
volks
, 
volks
– that me ans the Jewish Jews.  The Jewish Jews which 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0011
  
 
44
 
 
44
are speaking still Jewish, which are reading Jewi
sh books and they have the Jewish folklore and 
they still have the me mory, the heritage of
 European Jewry, is st
ill differentiated.   
 
Q: Do you consider yourself an American now?    

 

A: Yes, I™m an American, loyal American, a loya
l citizen and I know about what happened in the 
United States, politically and socially and I am
 very involve d.  I mean spiritually, because 
physically I can™t more.  But I was a me mber and 
I still am a me mber, but 
not so supportive as I 
was, I am a Republican.  I cannot say I don™t like 
De mocrats because they are democratic.  But I 
don™t like Democrats because they are more socia
listic.  And whatever smells of socialism or 
communis m is for me , a red flag.  And this is also
 a part of my  Israeli past, which was the Labor 
party, which was the priority moveme nt for ma ny y
ears.  And still they 
are trying to be, I don™t 
know what the outcome  will be.  Barak
1
 is a Soci alist and a member 
of the Socialist Labor party.  
And so are ma ny of the desert me mbers.  And I 
don™t like the religious extremists in the same  
way like I don™t like the liber al extremists.  I am
 used to a mi ddle way, to a way of tolerance and 
living in harmony with everybody. 
 

Q: When did you come  to the United States?    

 

A: In1980. 

 

Q: And did you come  directly to Kentucky? 

 

A: Do I come ?  

 

Q: Did you come  directly to Kentucky? 
 
A: Yeah, because my son was living in Kentucky, I came to Kentucky. 

 

Q: Do you remember your first impressions of
 the United States a
nd of Lexington?    
 

A: Well, I came to the United States before I came  to Lexington.  I came to New York several 
times.  And I ma ke tours in Canada and Californi
a and Florida.  I ma ke Caribbean.  And I knew 

about American life and I met American people. 
 I had my own idea about America.  And my 
idea about Jewish America didn™t change fr
om the beginning until t
oday.  However my two 
brothers are living here since ‚48, here.  But they 
are still Polish Jews.  They are Americans, but 
they are Polish Jews.  That™s what
 I meant befor e  what I said.   
 

Q: What is your idea about, what is 
your idea about Jewish Ame r ica?   
 

A: Jewish Ame r icans are Jews which speak Yiddish
, love Israel, enjoy thei
r life  in the United 
States, are good citizens here and liv
e a Jewish life.  It mustn™t be Orthodox, it mustn™t be strictly 
religious, but humanitarian Jewish life, with ever
ybody huma nistic.  That is my Jewish life, very 
huma nistic.  Our great Ra bbi and teacher, however
 it is a Rabbi, but a great Rabbi, the Orthodox 
Rabbi, when it came to he, to him one fa mous gentile person.  ﬁI will become  a Jew if you will

teach me  the Torah, how long I will stand on one leg.ﬂ  He says, ﬁNo problem, love your 
neighbor as yourself.  This is whole Jewish relig
ion and whole Jewish Torah, the most important 
thing.ﬂ  And that™s what it is, what I mean, a Je
wish American or an Ame r ican American or a 
Polish Amer ican.  Love the people who you ar
e live with and you have to live with and 
everybody to see a human being.  That™s my opinion.   
 

Q: Are you a member of a s ynagogue here in Lexington? 

 

A: Yes, I am a me mber of the conservative move
me nt.  I accept it.  There were asked about ma ny 
things which they change in the meantime wh
en I approach the synagogue.  There were no 
wome n called to the Torah.  There we re no women 
Rabbis.  Now there is.  But if they ask my 
opinion and I said, I will 
not be an exception.  I am for the ma
jority.  You decided that you want 
it this way, I will agree.  But not that I am fond of
 it, not that I like it.  
And that it my opinion. 
 

Q: You think that wome n should have the same  trad
itional roles that they had in Orthodox Judaism?  

 

A: No, they have to have more liberal.  But 
I still cannot accept a wo
ma n going to the Rabbi, 
because it is against the Halachic teachings.  I m
ean, I accept it, but I don™t find it nice.  And the 
teaching there is, if a woma n is not clean, she 
shouldn™t come between the community.  She is 

not clean, that means when she has her me nstrua
tion.  Only after she goes, she has me nstruation, 
after she finished and take a ritual bath, she 
is clean.  And she is even with everybody.  I don™t 
say she is not even, I don™t say this is a dirtiness or
 an illness, but it™s ag
ainst the teachings of our 
sages.  And if you go on to take off barriers one 
by one, officially as permissible, you take the 
balance off Jewish religion.  One of the two.  
You want to be Jewish you have to follow the 
teachings.  Even when you don™t follow, but you don™t have to revolutionize it.  That what I 

think.  I am not kosher, for example.  I am not doi
ng a lot of things.  I am riding on Shabbat.  But 
my opinion it is in those time s, Shabbat ther
e was no cars to ride on Shabbot.  There wa s no 
electricity to light.  There was ma ny things whic
h I found it.  But that™s for me , but I don™t say it 
is permissible.  It is not permissible, but I fi
nd it, I can do it.  If some
body doesn™t like it, it™s not 
my problem.  It™s his problem.  But I can 
do it.  I can do everything which I found, in my 
opinion, it is an answer
 which is logic.   
 

Q: Do you have friends here in Lexington, who 
are Jewish or non-Jewi
sh or what kind of 
community do you have here?    
 

A: Well, I can say really friends are non-Jewish. This is the ma jority. 
 Maybe there are some  
numbers really which I can say they are not Jewi
sh.  Three, four fa milies maybe or something 
like this.  But not to count as 
a really friend.  These are real
ly the Polish people, which are 
helping me  in need, when I had to go to an em
ergency, I call to the Polish people.  They come  
even in the mi ddle of the night 
and they bring me  to Emergency. 
 My wife is not driving and 
they bring me.  I don™t have to go in ambulance.
  And other things al
so, they are really good 
friends.  So, I really don™t differentiate it.  Becau
se you ask me I say they are accidentally Polish 
or Christian or Catholics and they
 are accident ally not.  But they are my fr iends and they are my 
friends, but not because  of they are Polish, because 
they are Catholics or they are Christians.  I 

don™t know if I have even one Cat
holic, exception of Polish people.

Q: Has it been important to you at all, did it, was 
it– let me  start over.  Wa s it ever important to 
you to talk about with other pe
ople your experiences during the Holocaust.  Did you get to a 
point where you felt like I really ha
ve to tell people that™s what
 I experienced and to be around 
people who understand? 
 
A: I was talking several times in school, whoever 
invite me  to give them, I give them my own 
experience.  But there was now a Reme mbrance 
day in the St. Luke church where there are 
me mbers, two or three Christians which are my
 friends.  And they are always counting on me  
that I will be the speaker.  And I for nine year s will be making the Reme mb rance.  They make it 

this year, too and I went to them, I don™t know I 
show it to you or you have
 it?   No?   I promise 
you to give it to you, my talk.  I have to make a 
copy.  I forgot to make a copy.  I will give it to 
you some da y if you will ask for it.  And they make
 it in such a honorable day that was really a 
pleasure to talk to these people 
and to explain to them, this ti

Tape 5, Side B 
 
A: Well, you asked me  if I s poke to people.  
I must tell you, to my disappointme nt– I don™t know, 
maybe not disappoint me nt, but take the reality lik
e it is.  I di dn™t have occasion to say my 
opinion or even some thing about th
e Holocaust to Jewish people.  If they invited me  to the 
Temple when there was Reme mbrance Day, they were 
asking me  to light a candle.  That was all.  
And they were ma king some  prayers.  And th
e same  was here in our synagogue, when they 

make.  And they come such a small number of pe
ople that it is really 
not worth it even to open 
your mouth to talk to them.  But I wasn™t asked 
to talk about the Holocaust.  I wasn™t asked.  
They talk, they ma ke some  prayers 
and that™s all.  And that was very mi serable, mi serable.  I was 
ashame d that I was a part of this Reme mbrance Day.  
And that™s it.  Jews are 
not interested in it.  
Maybe they have it enough in books.  Maybe they read
 about it, if that™s po
ssible.  I don™t know.  
But even when it is written, even when they read
 about it, I think, in my opinion, they have an 
opportunity to hear it from the first source.  They
 should ask to hear of it, they should.  But I 
don™t know why they didn™t.  Very ignorant, very 
ignorant.  And then they
 are not interested.  
The people, the few people who survive, they ar
e not interested, because they know the same , 
they have their opinion.  And the 
other people are here, born here 
or for years are here, they are 
already, they are already accustomed of the American 
habits, of the Jewish habits.  That™s what it 
is.  They are not interested.   
 

Q: Do you feel that the people who were born here
 and who are from here, are less, have been less 
receptive to you personally than have the newcomers?  
 

A: Well, I feel it, I feel it maybe personally, bu
t I don™t blame them.  Ma
ybe they were expecting 
more involvement from my side in their commun
ity life, which I couldn™t do, first of my age, 
secondly my language is not good enough to expose
 my– it is ma ybe i mproved already, but in 
the beginning my English was good to read, to unde
rstand.  But to speak with my accent, to talk 
about my experience and to be active in their comm
unity, it wa sn™t easy.  It was ma ybe  difficult.  
I even proposed and asked the Rabbi I can help
 him with the Hebrew lessons in the Sunday 
school ma ybe.  But he never asked me .  And nobody did ask me  to give a hand to some thing like 

that.  Maybe to a money drive, ma ybe they will 
ask me  to do it, but that
™s not my specialty.  I 
will not do it.  And that™s one thing.  The other 
thing is, which one influe ntial person told me , 
that they feel humiliated in my comp any.  That I 
am too special for them, so therefore they are 
hesitating approach me .  Well, I don™t know what is 
true, what the reason is, 
but this is the reality 
what I told you.  I am a stranger for them and I 
will rema in always to them a stranger.  However 
they are friendly.  If I approach th
em they answer my questions, but 
that ™s all, that™s all.  What 
can you do?   That™s the reality.  
And you have to live with it and we
 take it.  And we learn after 
so ma ny yea r s of life, you learn to li
ve with the reality, with each re
ality.  This is the ma in source 
of our strength, to take the 
everyday reality in our life as 
custom life.  And that™s it. 
 

Q: Last time  aft e r we finished our interv
iew you me ntioned off tape, some thing about the 
ﬁbusinessﬂ of the Holocaust or
 the business that the Holocaust
 has become  and I wonder if you 
would say some thing about that.  Does it bother
 you or do you feel that the Holocaust has been 
overly comme rcialized?

A: Again, I don™t know who will hear this tape, bu
t in the meantime there will be more business in 
this field.  You know, each community tries to 
make a museum, a Holocaust museum, which in 
itsel f is maybe a nice deed.  But who will come to this museum?  I think the Holocaust  museum 
which is in Wa shington is the one which was a 
necessity, very important.  And it fills all the 
spectrum of Holocaust and of Jewish life, before 
the war, in the war and after the war.  Maybe 
there are some nuances which come out which are 
not of value.  But to make so ma ny, I think 
people will not be interested to
 go to the main museum where th
ey have everything.  And this 
happens because of the way how Jewish society is
 built in the United Stat
es.  It has to be a 
society, it has to be a president, it has to be a vice
-president, it has to be 
a secretary, it has to be 
me mbers of the board and so forth and so forth.  Ma
ybe in itself it is as a social  thing, maybe it is 
good, ma ybe.  But I think a ma jor
ity of the raised funds goes 
to admi nistrative use, the 
paperwork and to expenses which are not profit of
 the social needs of people who really needs 
the help.  That is what I think.  And about co
mme r cializing the Holocaust, I think when you take 
thousand books and you put them in a computer and you take the essence, I think from these 

thousands you will ma ke one book which includes everyt hing.  So there is no need, in my 

opinion, for so ma ny editions, for so ma ny work 
with it in– I don™t know, I don™t know.  Of 
course, you can see a lot of people who became ve
ry famous because of the Holocaust, very 
fa mous.  But I don™t want to criticize them.  I 
don™t want to criticize nobo
dy.  But I think it is a 
crime if somebody ma ke s it only for the business. 
 

Q: I™m comi ng to the end of my questions.  Is th
ere some thing that we haven™t talked about that 
you™d like to talk about? 
 

A: Well, I gave, I gave a sketch a
bout my experiences and about how I 
see it.  It doesn™t mean that I 
don™t have, in general, what to say about.  And es
pecially to the future generations of Jewish 
people.  Maybe some body will listen to it.  Ma
ybe some body will try to understand my point of 
view.  But it is in the mo me nt, I a m ninety ye
ars old and I passed through all kind of Jewish life 
with joy and suffering.  It is like 
one Jewish sage said: ﬁIt is good 
to be born a Jew.  It™s good to 
die a Jew, but what do you do in the meanti me , th
is is the problem.ﬂ  From the beginning until 
the end, the Jews have a very ri
ch historical experience of life,
 which ma ny other religion or 
communities don™t have.  Not because they wanted, 
but the wind of history put the Je ws in the 
center of cultural life.  Even in the world.  No
t only in Germany, not only in Poland or in Russia 
or in Palestine or Spain or in the United States
.  Everywhere where the 
Jews were the center of 
civilized life, of cultural life was concentrated 
in the Jewish co mmunities or singles.  Je wish 
Nobel Prize winners, ther e were scientists in 
the United Stat es in me
dical field, in general 
science are not compatible to no on
e other people.  Maybe this is 
the reason that the jealousy of 
other people brings them to hatr
ed.  I cannot wish that the Jews 
wouldn™t concentrate of all this 
progress and culture and civilizati
on.  A country they have to do ev
erything possible what brings 
progress to the world.  But I am turning to the 
other point not to cover 
this with egocentric 
religious or national use.  To ta ke it more in human general pers
pective and civilized ways.  This 
is my advice and this is my way of t hinking.  
And that, and we will reme mber this, this can 
maybe, maybe some day bring to make us even with
 other nations in civili
zed world.  That we 
will not be  scapegoats in any way, which we were
 during all our histor y fr om the beginning until 
today.  To avoid it, listen what I said.  Thank you. 
 

Q: Thank you very much.
