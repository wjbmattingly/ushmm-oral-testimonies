Question: Why don't we -- 
I j ust need t o get  an out line of y o ur v o ic e. 
 
Answer: Okay.  My name is Be
lla Tovey, and I live in Silv
er Spring, Maryland.  And 
what  else do y o u want
 to know right now?
 
Q: I'm going to slate this ta
pe by saying my name is Nin
a Ellis, and I'm interviewing 
Bella Tovey.  Today is Mon
day, June 10th, 
1996. and we are at 
her home in Silv er 
Spring -- Silv er Spring, righ
t, Maryland.  I saw your vi
deo interview, and you talked 
a little bit about your
 mem or ies of y our liberat ion.  
And y ou were quit e ill at  that  
time, so a lot of it, 
I gues s, is har d  to r emember. 
 But c ould y ou m a ybe s t art ther e 
with some of the events around
 that time that are most 
outstanding to
 you?  And 
how y ou remem ber  that g
eneral period of time?
 
A: Well, I r e mem ber  -- ok ay , t hat ' s  okay.  I 
r e mem ber  being liber at e d by  the Br itis h.  
That is, I don't re
member it, but 
I was told late
r t hat  I was liber at ed by t h e Br it is h .  
Q: What do you rem e mber?  Do
 you k now wher e y o u were 
t h at day and what yo ur  
condition was?
 
A: Well, I was in Berg
en- Bels en in a barrack  in a -- I 
was  one of t h e luc ky ones a t  
that point , bec aus e I had a -- I wouldn' t  call
 it a bed.  St op it f or a s ec o nd.  I can' t  
think of t he name - -  I had 
a bunk  whic h I shar ed wit h 
another girl because what 
happened to me in
 Bergen-Belsen, and I already -- 
I did say that, but maybe it need 
clarif ying.  That about a mo
nth before liberation, I was 
lucky enough to
 have bee n  
tak e n out  of the bar rac k, of 
the death barrack th
at t hey c a lled, wher e I was on the 
floor wit h many  ot her  wom e n.
  And I was taken out of t
he barrack, thanks to m y  
girlfriend, Frieda, ab
out whom I also talk ed a lot.  
W h o managed t o get m e out of 
that barr ac k int o a work ing bar r ac k, and 
it was there that I 
shared a bunk with 
anot her gir l .  And it was fr om that barr a ck 
that I went to work, but for a very short 
time.  Actually, I had had -- 
by that time, I had had typhu
s, and when I c ame t o th i s  

second barrack where I 
was supposed to go 
to work, I came down
 with typhoid.  So 
th at I  b a s ic a l ly  wor k ed  for  a 
very  short  t ime.  And then no
 sooner did I 
get of this 
typhoid, I came down with 
what they called 
paratyphoid.  It 
must have been a 
repetit ion of that high 
fever.  And it  was then
 that I -- as I was st
ill sick with typhoid, I 
had fever and I don't 
remember much happeni
ng to me, that I wa s liberated.  I do 

remember that my girlfrie
nd, Frie da, came.  She was 
very concerne
d about me. 
Things were obviously  going 
on in Bergen-Belsen.  Th
e Br it is h m ust h av e b ee n  
very close.  Some of the SS men were tryi
ng to escape. 
 Things were 
unsettled in 
the camp.  I don'
t know it, but I 
r e mem ber  being told.  But my
 girlfriend, Frieda, who 
was  in a differ ent  part  of  Ber g en-Bels e n 
becaus e s he work ed as  a r u nner  for  a 

hospital, worried about me. 
 She knew something wa s wr
ong.  She t o ld me later  
she s e ns ed that s om et h ing wa
s r eally wr ong.  So s he 
c a me t o s ee me, and I was  
on the bunk.  I was feverish, I had not eaten,
 and I think I said t
hat for cert ain mor e  
than a week.  And I don't th
ink I  had anyt hing to dr in
k for days on end.  Whe n  
people tell you that you ca
n't live without food 
and drink, well, I managed.  And I 
wasn't the only one in ca
mp.  But anyway, she did co
me, I think sh
e brought me 
some water.  I thin
k she managed to 
bring me -- sh
e says she brought me some 
aspirin.  I don't reme
mber.  And she sat with
 me t hr o ugh the night,  
and,  in fact,  I d o  
remember somet h in
g else.  As  she 
came t o  my part  of  the 
camp, I think 
they were 
try ing to st op her .  Bec a us e s o mebody di
d --  s h e was  s h ot, somebody hurt her .  
And I remember that the only thing I rememb
er is seeing Frieda
 and seeing blood. 
I s a w a lot  of  blood.   She t o
ld me later that it wasn't
 that she was bleeding so 
profusely, she was hurt in he
r arm.  It  was a very -- what
 is  it ?  It  wa s n ot a ver y  
severe wound.  I t h
in k the bullet must have just scr
aped her skin or
 som et h ing.  
And she had enough pr
esence she just, you know, pu
t something around her arm, 
but it must have been red.  I saw he
r bleeding, and this I remember.  I als o  
remember people shouti
ng that we are liberated.  I 
also remember 
that somebody 
tried to give me something to
 eat,  and I  c o uldn't  eat.   And 
I know now, I knew later, 
too, t hat  I was  v ery  luc ky t h at I  c ouldn't 
eat.  Because what happ
ened is that Brit ish 
soldiers felt  so sorry for t
he inmates that  they 
gave them their rati
on s,  a n d m ost  o f  
the inmates in Be
rgen-Belsen were not abl
e to handle that kind 
of food.  An d -- go 
ahead.
 
Q: Let me ask you to go back 
just a little bit.
  Do y ou r e mem ber v e ry muc h about  
that wor k ing barr ac ks befor e
 y o u got s ic k ?  Can y ou t e
ll me someth
in g about who 
was in there, what it look
ed lik e, what  y o ur av er age day was lik e r i ght  bef or e y o u 
got s i ck ?  Bec a us e it was about a month t h
at you wer e in there alt oget her, r ight ?
 
A: Oh, sure.  I remember th
e barrack.  The barrack was 
a long barrack. 
 There were 
bunks on bot h sides.  I f  yo
u ev er saw any of the pict ures
, it was t h e normal k i nd o f  
a thing.  You walk ed in a
nd the bunks were on both 
s i des, and it was lik e a 
throughway.  Like a co
rridor in the middle.  The bun
ks were double.  You know, on e 
on t o p of the ot her.  Very sm all, c r owded. 
 T w o wom en,  two of us shar ing a bunk.  
We didn't hav e t oo muc h r o
om.  If I had to tu
rn around, my part
ner had t o  tur n  
around.  Yo u know, we  
had to be alwa ys aligned.  So 
it  was  -- b ut it  
was heaven in 
com p ar is on to t he barr ac k fr om whic h I c am e
 wher e we were on t h e f loor and just  
som e str a w.  It was j ust terr
ible.  Of course, the 
barr ack was also in
fested wi
th lice, 
ev en t he one I was 
in.  Bec a us e . .  .
 
Q: Did you have 
any bedclothes?
 
A: We had a -- oh, yes, we 
did.  We had a straw mattres
s, and we had -- ev er y bod y  
had lik e a blanket.  I r em emb
er we had a blank et.  I reme
m ber it was dark gray.  I  
don't remember exactly -- cert
ainly no pillows, no
 sheets.  But, as 
I said, this was 
heaven.  Now, I went -- most 
of t he people who wer e in th
is barrack went to work. 

And t h e work that I was tak e n to or was s ent
 to was to sort clot
hing in a warehouse. 
And, of course, t h e c l othing was t he c l othi
ng that they had m
anaged to bring from 
the ot her c am ps.  Fr om Au
schwitz most ly, because a lo
t of inmates in Bergen-
Bels en had come from Au schwit z.  An d th
is was mostly clothi
ng that belonged to 
Jewish people or other people 
that were taken 
to concentration 
camps.  And we 
had t o sort things, s o c ks and 
stockings and underwea
r.  All of it, by t he t ime we go t  
it, I t h ink it  was alr eady 
was hed.   And ther e was an 
SS m an in char g e.  Ev er y  
mor n ing we had t o get  up, I 
do remember we ha
d to get at about 
5 o'clock.  Appell 
was at 5:30.  I was given -- 
when I came to th
is barr ack, I was 
given a uniform, a 
famous gray and blue striped. 
 Basically, what women were 
giv e n.  It's  lik e a dr es s,  
not a j a ck et.  Men wor e pant
s -- slacks and jack
et s, and we wor e lik e long dr es s. 
And underneath, since I was wo
rking in  the ware
house, I was permitt
ed the first day 
when I came, because I 
probably had rags by 
the time I got to th
is camp.  But I was 
permitted to take from the warehouse
 a pair panties, I 
suppose maybe som e  
stockings, maybe slacks.  I don't r em ember 
t hat.  And it was winter .   A blous e an d a 
sweater.  I didn't have a bra, 
I didn't any bra.  
I was j ust  as f l at as anyt hing.  I  was  
ver y s k inny alr e ady.  The way one coul
d surviv e in Bergen-Belsen when one 
worked, and that's why 
the death rate on th
is working camps was a little lower, was 
that y o u c ould st eal som et h
ing and exchange it. 
 So when I finally got to this 
work ing place where t hat fir st day that 
I got my clothing, 
when I cam e hom e - -  
home meaning to the barrack 
-- I would, say, take off my
 s weat er .   And the nex t  
day, I would just put on my blouse and that
 unif orm, and that s w eater st ay ed on m y  
bunk, let's say.  Or I  sold 
it that evening for a couple 
piec es  of  br ead may be or a 
bowl of soup.  Then the 
next day, I would go to wo
rk, and when I was working, 
there was always a c hance you 
could sneak in somewhere 
and get a pair of -- get  
another sweater and put it  on
 and then I 
had something.  Unfo
rtunately, we had a 
kapo.  A kapo is a Jewish 
woman.  Actually, 
she was pr obably just a couple of  
years older than I.  She wa
s very pretty.  Sh e was not 
a ______ like I 
was.  I was 
ver y sk inny , I look ed lik e --
 I  was already at  that point  
a walk ing skeleton, and I think 
she dislik ed me.  She dislik ed all of us 
who looked so terribly
 bad, and I thought 
one day of t r y ing to r ead.  I'm s ur e som e
t h ing was wr itt en about J e wish women - -  of  
course, she was a bitch.  Bu
t why  she was s o part ic ular ly
 mean to me and those of 
us who looked so bad would 
probably make a good case 
study for a ps
ychologist.  
Was  it t hat  she s aw in m e what  could 
happen to he
r?  Pr
obably.  There was 
anot her r eason why she dis l ik ed me, and 
t h at was m y own fault.  The SS m a n wh o 
was in charge of our group 
sent her to get so
me books  f r om a litt le -- th er e wa s a 
litt le off ic e wher e he had 
some books.  He needed something.  Well, she was I think 
illiterate, or if
 she was not illitera
te -- maybe she wa
s not illitera
te.  But sh
e certainly 
did not read and wr it
e German.  I don't k
now how good her Poli
sh was.  I didn 't 
speak t o her much.  She was 
born in Poland, sh
e c am e fr om a litt le t o wn.   She was  
ver y pr etty .   So he s ent her t o get 
t he book,  and s h e br o
ught the wr ong book 
because she didn't know 
how to read.  But she 
didn't have the courag
e to tell him, "I  
don't r e ad Germ an."  So he t ur n ed ar ou
nd and look ed at m e, 
and he said, "This 

litt le one looks sm art.  Why don't  you 
go and get m e t he book ?"  And I m a de a 
horrib le mistake, and brought him the ri
ght  book .  And s he nev e r for gave me for  
that, so as a result, what 
she did is the following day wh
en we came on appell,  she 
made me lift up my uniform to
 check what I missing. 
 And when she 
saw that I 
didn't hav e  a blous e on, th
at I only had the sweater wh
ic h is wh a t  may b e I was  
hoping to steal so I could 
hav e a bowl of s o up.  Right
 away, what ev er I s o ld an d 
whatever I got for it I shared
 with my girlfriend, Frieda, 
always.  So she said -- sh e 
started beating on me, of co
urse, and she said, 
"You're not going 
to take anything 
back wit h you. "  Even though t h is wa
s a kind of a gent lem a n' s agr eement,  
ev er ybody did it.  She did it, 
t o o.  And so m y car e er in 
that sense ended.  I had an 
interest ing t h ing t hat happened be
cause of it.  I'm 
tak ing y ou t o a di
fferent part.  The  
gir l wit h whom I s har ed that
 bunk wa s a cousin of Frieda
's friend in the hospital. 
When Fr ieda was t ak en out fr
om that barr ac k, fr om t hat deat h barrack,  v e ry --  
or iginally, if  you hear d my 
st ory, y ou k now t h at s om e on
e whose lif e was s av e d m y  
Frieda's sister took her out of
 that place.  And 
she first didn't w
ant to go, but sh e 
went  because,  of  c o urs e --  that  s a me, 
her name was Sa lk a Longe
tt (ph), the same 
woman who took Fr ieda out of 
the death barrack took out 
another girl by the name 
of -- her name was Ruth, and 
I don't  rem em b er her  ot her  
name now.  An
d Ruth was 
her girlfriend, so she also 
saved Ruth.  I mean
 -- I don't mean save
, but took her out 
that horr ible barr ac k wher e t h e deat h r ate
 was the highest.  So
 when Frieda was 
able to get  me t o t h is  wor k ing barr ac k, 
that  friend of hers, Ruth, with whom  she 
became friendly now because 
they were working together
 in that hospit al, managed 
to get her  cous in.  And t hat  c o us in's
 name was -- 
I don't remem
ber  any mor e, 
Franka ( ph), Fr anc is.  She wa
s a v ery plac id, not ver y  br
ight gir l,  and I t h ink  sh e 
was j ust not a very nice pe
r son.  But may be,  may b e jus t
 not to me, I don't know. 
She fared much bett
er with the kapo.  Fi
rst of all, she was not that skinny.  As I 
said, I think she was not that
 br ight.  And s h e was managi
ng to -- and she didn't get 
sick as I did short ly aft er that. 
 But  what ever it  was, but s
he k new t h at all of us were 
bringing things.  She didn't 
know that I was being picke
d on by the kapo, or she 
didn't pay attentio n.  What sh
e did do is  that  af ter t h e wa
r,  aft er I was already out  of  
the hos p it al and now I ' m goin
g ahead of it.  I didn't see 
my friend, Fri
eda.  I fully 
expect ed her t o c om e and s ee m e, and she 
didn't.  She came to 
t h e hos pital onc e,  
maybe.  I don't re
m em ber.  But j u st t he relat i ons h ip
 was not what it
 was,  and so I  
went -- when I was alr e ady be
tter, I went to se
e my gir l
fr iend, Fr
ieda.  And s he was  
cold t o me,  she wasn't ver y 
pleasant.  I don't know that 
I ever told any
body that, but 
I just remembered.  So I said
, "Frieda" -- we went out for 
a walk.  It was already i n  
the DP camp.  And I said 
to her, "Frieda, 
what' s going on?  W hy ar e you s o  
unc ar ing?  I s s om ething wr o
ng?"  And she got ve
ry angr y .   She got  v ery ups et, and  
she s a id t h at F r ancis, the ot her girl, t o ld 
her that I did not shar
e with her everything 
that I was able to get -- yo
u know, that I was getting, 
br inging s ome st uff and I wa s  
probably selling it and gett
ing maybe some bread.  And 
I wa nt you to know that 
Fr ieda was not liv ing in heav en
 ther e.  I mean s he was wo
rking in that hospit al, but 
she was hungry from -- I mean
 t here was j ust  no quest i
on that Be rgen-Belsen was 

a horr ible plac e, ev en if yo
u wor k.   And s he said that 
s h e was v ery  hurt when she 
hear d Fr ancis t e ll her t hat 
I did not shar e, be
caus e t h is was -- y ou know, we wer e  
lik e  s is t er s.   This was  an agr eem ent t h at --
 we didn't write anyt
hing to each other, 
but this was a giv e n.  
And s he s a id to me t h at t hat ' s wh
at Francis told her, that I did 
not --  t hat  I bas ic a lly  cheat
ed on Fr ieda.  And I got terribly upset, I remember  I cried.  
We had a long t a lk, and we m
ade up.  She believ e d me.  I'
m grat ef ul to t his day we 
are still friends.  In fact, I 
just s a w h er in I s ra el a ga i n.  But s o I h ad t h is t err ib le  
experience, but it was this Fr
anc is  with whom  I shar ed, t h
at bum.  And it  was this 
Francis who I remember, because she did no
t get sick as I did,
 when I was so sick 
towa rd the end of my 
stay in Bergen-Belsen that she 
just was j ust a very uncar ing 
pers on, at  least as f ar as 
I was concerned.  So . . .
 
Q: The close relationship that
 you had with Frie
da was clearly very im portant to 
you.  W a s t hat -- did ot her wom e n 
hav e c l os e relations h ips lik e t hat ?
 
A: T h at was v ery im port ant t o m any of us. 
 Very often a relat i ons h ip suc h as this  
was was ther e bet w een, let's sa
y, two sisters.  If some of
 them were lucky and they 
had a m ot her and daught er, 
but  us ually t w o s i st ers, t w o c o us ins .   Int er est ingl y  
enough,  not alway s did the t w o s is t ers  get  al
ong.  It wa s not alwa
ys,  but m a ny  of us  
did f orm t h es e k i nd of  relati
onships, and it was extremel
y im portant for all kinds of 
reasons.   I  mean not  j ust  -- fi
rst  o f  a l l,  it was  im po rta nt  t o su rv iv a l.   Wh en  we were  
on t h e deat h marc h, when Fr ie
da couldn't walk, I dragged 
her.  And when she didn't  
want t o get up, I pus hed her. 
 Or I couldn't -- and in Bergen
- Be l s en, if  it wo u l dn 't be  
for Frieda, I probably 
wouldn't be sitting he
re and talk ing to 
you.  There's no 
question that she saved my li
fe, and I don't thin k 
this was true just
 for me.  We ha d 
a lot of us f orm ed t h es e k i nd of r e lat ionshi
ps.  I know that He nry, my husband, ha d 
a kind of -- actually, he 
wa s with a group, but he had 
one friend wh
o I didn't even 
know about, because Henry doesn
't  talk much.  But we we
re in Sweden a couple of 
year s ago,  and we wer e st
aying with one of his frie
nds with whom he was in 
Aus chwit z and in t h e c am ps.  
And his name is Jacob, and 
they were awfu
lly n ic e t o  
us.  We had a tour, but then 
we stayed a couple of days with them.  And Jacob told  
me for the first time, I didn'
t know, that he's aliv e bec
ause of  Henr y.  T hat  Henr y  
lit erally c arr ied him dur i ng t h e death m arc h.
  Henr y nev e r told 
me that, but these 
things were happening to a lo
t of people.  This was very im portant to hav e  
somebody.
 
Q: Once the British ca
me and you started to get your 
health back, yo
u st ay e d ther e 
bec aus e it bec am e a DP 
camp; is that correct?
 
A: Oh, yeah.
 
Q: How did -- what was y o ur life lik e ther e, 
let's just  say, for like the first three 
months or s o of th
at s u mmer of 1945?
 
A: I'm trying to remember.  
I pr obably cam e out of  the ho
spit al -- I was 
liberated o n  
April 15th.  I have no dates
 to give you, I 
don't remember w
hen I was -- they 

probably took me out of the 
hospit al as soon as I wa
s not contagious.  Be cause 
when I was taken to the hosp
it al, I had paratyphus, but I 
was already lucid.  I, for 
inst anc e, remem ber  being t ak e
n out, not fully, bu
t I remember that 
they put us on a 
truc k or s o met h ing, sinc e t he s ic k peopl
e went first.  But I 
do remember bein g 
spr a yed with DDT, I always t a lk
 about it; it's such a wo
nderful feeling.  And I 
remember t hat t h
e air, when we're driven out of Be
rgen-Belsen, the air smelled so 
sweet once we left.  But I don'
t remember how long I was in
 the hospital.  It was not 
probably a very long ti
me because I think that
 it  was already in 
May I was already in 
a DP camp.  In the DP camp
, actually, you probably know about it, wa
s formed in a 
place called Bergen, not Bergen-Bels en.  Be
rgen had -- these we
re army, this was 
an arm y camp.  And w
hat  the Br it is h did, is
 that they took ov
er the German Army 
cam p, and they t ur ned it int o a DP c am p
.  The Jews were no
t t h e only inm at e s  
there.   T h ey  had Russ ians
 -- I don't  think there were too many Poles there, 
meaning non-Jewish Polish people.  Ther
e was Polish, but no 
Jewish.  They had 
men and women, but they 
kept  the barr acks separ a te
ly.  So I  was put in, I 
remember I was in Block -- 
if I'm not mistaken -- Bloc
k Number 73, whic h was one 
of the blocks where 
the women were put.  And what 
they would do, 
we were given 
a room, the blocks was a 
two-story house.  I don't 
remember how many rooms 
were on each floor, but I 
do r em e mber that we had a 
bathr o om and s hower s  on 
one f l oor and t h en one -- so 
I have no idea how
 many.  I don't remember.  I do 
know that I wa s given a room on the second 
st ory, second floor wi
th this Fr ancis.  
Pr obably because I came out 
wi th her, and I very quickly 
moved out.  I didn't want  
to s h ar e wit h her.  T h er e m ay hav e  been 
somebody else in that
 room.  And I met a 
very nice girl who wa s from Lódz, was in
 Bergen-Belsen, who 
wa s about five years 
older than I.  An d I actually
 came to borrow a frying pan
 from her, I want ed to do  
something.  An d we 
became very friendly, and she 
took me in to the room where 
she s h ar ed wit h thr e e ot her 
women.  And so we
 were five of us
 in one room, and 
we also had bunks, 
but these bunks we re 
now priv ate.  I had
 my own bunk, an d 
there was one abov e me and t here wer e  
five or six bunks.  Becaus e I think 
eventually, we took in anot
her gir l , and t h e room had -- 
so we had bunks.  It was a 
good- siz ed room, and t h
ere was a table in t he middle. 
 And then t her e was a c l oset,  
I s u ppos e,  for c l othing.   Peopl
e had clothing.  And then, of
 c our s e, if we want e d t o  
was h and shower or us e t h e bat hr oom,  
there was one big co
mmunal
.  I suppose 
this was the way soldiers li
v e d in these barr ac ks, s o t h at' s -- it was sum m er.  We 
were coming out from a bad 
situation, we had fo
od.  It was not wo
nderful food, but 
we were -- I'm trying
 to remember.  
We probably were given al
l the bread 
we -- we 
had enough.  I reme
mber for the first ti
m e not being hungry, 
whic h means that we 
were given soups.  I think 
O N R m ov e d in  rat he r  q u i ck ly  
and pr ov ided, they had b i g 
kitchens.  We had to 
go to the kitchens to 
pick up our -- I thin k,
 midday soup meal. 
In other words, we were 
given soup and pr
obably  br ead.  I don't r em e mber  
anything more than that.
 
Q: What did y o u do during t
he first  few week s ?  W h at di
d you do?  Wer e you s t rong 
enough t o go out ?  C
ould y ou leave t h e c am p?
 

A: I don't remember leaving the camp.  I think what we 
did in the beginning, we 
were trying to -- I ha
ve all kinds of me
mories.  Well, the first th
ing that  we tr ied t o  do  
is t o f in d o u t  wh o wa s a l iv e.  I rem em ber
 going to t he -- t her
e was already probably 
som et h ing, a c omm unit y c e nter  for m ed.  I n 
f a ct, t her e was one.  I n
 fact, if  you ever 
heard about Hadassah, Gro
ss Ros e n, her  hus band, she 
by t hat tim e was  no t  
married t o him.  She come
s from my city.  
Her nam e was Hadass ah Bink a ( p h), I 
th in k it wa s .   Sh e wa s a d e n
t ist.  She sur v iv ed, she was 
in Ber g en-Bels e n.  I th in k  
her husband-to-be, much older than I.  If no
t much older, certai
nly he wa s an adult 
befor e t he war.  So there m ust hav e 
been Jewish who formed
 some kind of a 
comm unity,  and maybe they we
re the ones who work ed wit h
 ONR to start bringin g  
things.  So I rememb
er going there probably,
 and trying to get 
li sts of people who 
surviv ed.  My girlfriend, Es
t her, s t art ed volunt eer ing in 
a hospit al.  I probably took 
car e  of  t h ings  in t he r o om.  M ay b e I  
wa s the one.  Be cause 
everybody was doing 
something.  I wa s probably 
t he one who would go and ge
t the f o od.   I was pr obably  
still weak er  than t he ot her gir l s ther e bec a
us e I had c o me out of
 the hospit als, and 
they were not -- they
 came directly from the camp.  Ther e were some, I have a 
memory of sitting on the gr
ass.  So I think that behind 
the barracks, there may hav e  
been some la wns.  We probably would si
t around and talk.  
We probably talk ed a 
lot about what happened 
to us and about 
our family and whethe
r we're going to find 
anybody.  That was in the begi
nning, I had a very 
diffic ult then with
 my girlfriend, 
Esther.  I found Frieda, reme
m b er I told t he st ory what 
happened.  S
he was already  
at t h at point s har ing a ro
om with some other people 
with whom she was, so we 
never -- we did not get back 
together that way, becaus
e I had f o und Est h er.  But 
our relationship was great, that
 was the problem.  I was -- 
my girlfriend
, Esther, was 
ver y hopef u l that her boyfr i end s urv ived
.  She c am e fr om Lódz, and she was in 
Auschwit z, she was an only 
child.  But she went to Au
schwit z with her parents. 
She was s epar at e d fr om her par ents, bu
t m anaged t o go t hr o u
gh Auschwit z with 
her boyfriend's mother and si
ster.  They went to Au schw
it z together, they ended up 
at some, I don't know
 what camp.  I think they we
re in Mauthausen
, but I don't 
rem ember,  and they ended up in Ber gen- B el
s en.  And m y gir lfr iend, Est h er, who a s  
I told you was about  
five years older than I, that 
she mothered me because, yo u 
know, I was -- in 1945, I was bo
rn in 1946, so I was 19 ri
ght aft er t h e way, not quit e 
20.  So my -- no, I wa
sn't even -- wait a mi
nute.  I wa s born in
 1946, I wa s not even 
19; I was 18, go
ing on 19.  
 
Q: Let me turn 
the t ape ov er.
 
A: Yea h.  
 
Q: This an interview with Bella Tovey.  This is Tape 1, Side 2.  
 
A: So what  happened to her 
that she was in Auschwit z, 
talk ing about my girlfriend, 
Esther.  With her boyfriend's mother
, and she was practically engaged to be 
married to t h is guy.  
 Having been five ye
ars older than I, she 
was -- I know that she 
gr aduat ed f r om Gym n as ium  bef o re t h e war.
  She was born in 
1921, yeah, so she 

was about  fiv e y ear s older.  Any w ay, s he 
buried that future 
mother-in-la w and her 
boyfr i end's sist er in Bergen- Be
ls en.  In other words, they
 didn't s urv ive, but she had 
hoped that her boyfrie
nd survived.  She ha
d heard from so
mebody that 
he was in a 
cam p wit h  his br ot her.  And t hen, m u
st have been abou
t a month aft er t he 
liber at ion, may b e a litt le long
er, but I remember that we we
re together in
 this room 
with the other girls.  And somebody came with the news, must 
have been a friend 
of her husband -- of her boyf
riend.  In fact, it
 was a friend, I re
member, who was his 
friend and t o ld her  t hat  
-- his  nam e was  M anik ( p h), I  
don't  what , t h e Polis h name 
was Manik, wh atever
.  That he was k
illed a day -- he died 
or somethin g happened 
a day aft er  liber at i on.  Just a day  after lib
eration.  And my girlfriend, Esther, went  
into what I now know
, into a deep depr es s ion.  She 
refused to get 
out of bed, she 
stayed in  the bunk.  And I 
was very concerned 
for her.  And I do 
remember t hat I 
would sit and I would sing
 t o her for hour s.  The ot her gi
r ls ,  we  a l l t r ied  to  ta k e  ca re  
of her, but I wa s the closest to her.  
And I would sit there for hours, and I would 
sing. 
 
Q: What would y ou s i ng?
 
A: Al l kinds of songs.  Poli
sh songs, anything that I reme
mbered.  I came from a bit 
of s i nging fam i ly.  My mom 
had a beautiful voic e, and we
 alway s sang at hom e .  So 
I sang what ev er, you k now.  
And I  would tr y t o mak e her  
eat, and friends
 came.  In 
fact, Henry, my husband, who 
was not my friend then, bu
t he knew Esther because 
he comes from the same city
.  And they were 
together in the ghe
tto in the same 
area.  Anyway, I reme
mber he would come and bri
ng some goodies. 
 Men alwa ys 
managed to bring some
 food.  They manage
d to -- he probably 
already was getting 
out of the camp occasionally
.  But I don't re
member how long it lasted, but I think 
that what I did t hen and I talk ed t o  her .  An
d I  would hav e a t a lk t o he lp, and then - -  
originally, first, of course,she was talk ing about her bo
y f riend and Manik and what  
friends they had and 
how m uc h she loved him and a
ll that.  But then I would -- 
today, I suppose I could say 
that maybe I acted 
as a therapist.  Bu
t I didn't have any 
schooling, I just did somethin
g instinctively trying to help 
her.  So I st art ed to as k  
her to t ell me about life bef or e the war, 
what  she did befor e the 
wa r.  What sc hoo l  
she went  to, who wer e 
her fr iends.   And t
hen she t o ld m e t hat  s he had a boyfr i en d 
before the war, that she 
had a boyfriend, and they 
were kind of
 like childhood 
sweethearts.  And in 1939
 when t he war  br ok e out,  he
r boyfriend, whose name was 
Lolak ( ph), and his f at her -- 
his  f at her  was a pr ofess or  at t h e Jewis h G ym nasium,  
and they knew because they we
re intelligentsia that they'r
e going to be -- they were 
in anger.  They we
re told that the best thing for them 
is to get out.  At that time it 
wasn't because he was Jewish, this  wa
s when t h e Germ ans 
were removing the 
Polish intelligentsia, 
and among them, of 
course, the educated
 Jews, too.  S o  
Lolak's father, his name was Seka and Lolak
 dec i ded t o run away  to Rus s ia.  An d 
they  c am e to Est her,  and t h
ey wanted her to
 go with them.  Lol
ak, her boyfriend, 
was a year older than Esther, and he 
graduated from 
the Jewish Gymnasiu m in  
1938.  He was ac c ept ed at 
the Hebrew Univ ersi
ty in Jerusalem, 
but he wait ed for 

Est h er, who was also ac cept ed
.  An d they were going to go
 in 1939 to
 Israel, but 
they m i ss ed it bec a us e war brok e out.   So
 they wer e really ser i ous about  eac h  
ot her,  and he want ed her t o go wit h him 
to Russia.   But she was an only child and 
she c ouldn' t  leav e her parent
s, so they  part e d com pany  
and he escape
d to Russ ia 
with his father.  When she started to talk 
to me about Lolak, 
I k e pt going back t o  
Lolak.  Whenever she woul
d ment ion her boyfr i end, then 
apparently li
fe took it s 
cour se.   Lolak was in Russia,
 s h e was a v e ry pretty gir l
.  She met this guy in the 
ghett o, and they became c l os e and had he
 s urv iv ed,  I'm s ure s he would hav e  
ended up with him.  
But I just wanted to 
know about all of that, and I made her talk  
to me about all tha
t.  And I was singing to her, an
d she was so -- I think that I 
probably spent probably 
the rest of that month, May,
 maybe into, I would say -- I 
would say that it took
 about maybe a month 
to get her back out of
 bed.  And she did 
get out  of  bed, and s he we
nt back to work in
 the hospital wher
e she had started 
befor e s h e dec i ded t hat lif e is not wort h an
yt hing.  And I want t o t e ll you t hat -- t w o 
things:  Number one when sh
e came back, w
hen she came ba
ck to herself, 
somebody came and told me that my father
 is  aliv e and was in 
Munich.  I had . . .
 
Q: That's your . . .
 
A: My father.  That somebod
y  by t he nam e  of Aar o n Nak a bov ic h  (ph), t h at 's  my  
father's name, is aliv e, 
and he should be so
mewhere in the ca
mp near Munich. 
Now, I had not s e en him on t he list, but s o
m ebody said that t h
ey saw him on the 
list.   I did f i nd my s ist er at 
that point -- no, I didn't.  I k
new my sister h
ad a chanc e t o 
surviv e.  No, I didn't know 
anyt hing about m y s ist er, but  I 
put my name on
 the list. 
And when I heard that my
 f at her  is  aliv e,  I 
decided to go an
d look for her.  Now, this 
is an inter e sting s t or y.  Bec a us e what 
happened is that trav
eling thr ough G erm an y  
at that point was impossible,
 but people did.  
We were looking fo
r people, so the 
first thing that was ne
cessary was to outfit 
me for the trip.  And 
my girlfriend, Esther, 
who was not a wonderfu
l thief, stole -- I 
didn't have shoes. 
 I had like cloppers, it 
was summer.  An d I probably 
had some clothing that 
the O N R gav e m e, but wher e 
I'm going t o go on a t r ip, I 
need something a little more
 dec ent  than that.  A war m  
jacket maybe.  Eveni
ngs in  Europe, even 
in t he s umm er , ar e c o ld,  colder.  So she 
stole shoes, two shoes for me
.  But they were two left 
shoes, they  were, you know, 
kind of lik e,  you k now,  lik e
 shoes with lace. 
 Good walking s h oes.   So s he s t ole 
them, or or ganized t hem as we
 us ed to call it in the ho
spital.  So mebody gave me, 
or m ay b e I  had a pair of s l ac ks.   And t h
en anot her girl -- 
t he whole r o om go t  
toget her and t hey outf it ted m e. 
 So I got a pair  of s lack s 
and I got  a nic e s hirt and a 
shirt to change, and 
a sweat er or  a jack e
t, and even a ker c hief.  And Est her wa s  
telling me how to, if  
I need to get off the train or I 
need to step down 
or s omet h ing ,  
since I'm wearing slacks, you c
an't t e ll that t h ey ar e t w o 
left shoes.  Bu
t if I always 
step out with my le
ft foot, then nobody 
will notice that I ha
ve two left shoes. 
Managed very well with
 these two left shoes, so I went, 
but I didn't go.  It had to be 
arranged.  I didn't go alone.  I we nt with
, actually, Henry and 
a friend of his, 
bec aus e they had had 
pneumonia and they we
re being sent to a sa
nitorium just to 

mak e sure that it does n't  
develop into somethin
g els e.  So t hey were going t o  a 
place called sanitorium near Munich, and I 
want ed t o go to M unich, s o I went wit h  
them.  And it was an experienc
e,  because y ou couldn't bu
y t ic ket s.   You had t o - -  
some of Henry's friends litera
lly carried us and th
rew us into a trai
n that wa s leaving 
Hannover.  I don'
t know how we got to 
Hannov er.  I k now how 
we did.  Henry had a 
friend who was already workin
g for the Br it is h, he spoke Englis h.  So he managed 
to borrow a Jeep.  
So the thr e e of  us, wit h his fr
iend -- his name
 was Alexander, 
took us to t he tr ain to t he near est cit y 
which was called Hannover.
  We went fr om - -  
and a couple of his friends
 must have gone 
along, because I 
remember being 
thrown into the train thro
ugh the window, ok ay.  And s o
mehow t he three of us  got  
on the train, and the train 
we nt to the -- stopped at th
e Am eric an zone
.  Because,  
you see, we're in  the Br it is h 
zone.  So we had 
to get through to 
the American zone, 
but this was the beginning of the war.  T
he soldiers were very
 sympathetic to us, 
they k new who we were.  All 
we had to do is tell them 
t hat we ar e Jewish, DP, you 
know, people -- refugees.  And 
the Americans let us through
, we didn't have to -- 
later on t hat became mu
ch more difficult, but 
at that point, it was 
easy.  I do want to 
tell you this, and this was 
very important.  The Am erican
 and t h e Br it is h, I don't  
know about the Ru ssian soldiers were extremely 
nice to us in th
e beginning.  When 
they shipped the Amer
ican boys home
, and they knew
 the young -- I don't know -- 
the young, they knew what Americans, 
I s u ppose,  want ed t o do and m a ybe the 
Br it is h did t he s ame.  They want ed t o send
 the war-weary soldie
rs  hom e, so t he y  
sent t h em home.   And t hen 
when the new soldiers came
 in, those who didn't see 
the concentration camps, thos
e who didn't see what we w
ent through, 
they st arted 
frat er niz i ng wit h the fr auleins
, with the German 
gir l s and they were muc h nast ier t o  
us.  They were not so
 understanding, it wa s 
much harder.  It was 
pa inf u l, too.  S o  
that's -- but, you know, I remember at that
 time being very angry
 about it, but I now 
understand why a little 
better.  But anyway, I went thr
ough, we  went through to the 
Am eric an zone.  I got to Muni
ch, turned out that this was 
not my father, of course. 
But when I came ba
ck ,  oh, I also want t o t e ll you -- I 
als o want t o t e ll y ou t h at  the 
train wasn't  always -- t hen one 
of  the tr ains t hat we t ook 
on that was really funny. 
We had - -  Germ any was dev a
stat ed.  T h e c it i es wer e 
bombed out.  The tr ain -- th e 
trip that s h ould have t ak e n maybe, I don'
t know, 10 hours, we 
were traveling for a 
week.  We would stop
 in places, we w
oul
d st op in DP camps,
 some Jewish inmates 
would t ak e  us in.  T hen we would go f a
rther.  It was a whole undertaking.  I 
remember being, for one st
retch of the road, we hitc
hed -- we managed to hitch-
hike or somethin g, I don't k
now.  We managed to
 get on a train th
at carried oil or 
gas, because they were thos e round -- what do they call 
them ?  I suppose, trying to 
rem ember.  They look ed like 
a big, round barrel, and yo
u c ouldn' t  -- ther e was  no 
way, and the only thing it 
had like a little balcony 
in front for I suppose th e 
conduct ors.   And I rem em ber Henry and I an
d his friend, we were
 sitting on one of 
thos e litt le, it look ed
 lik e a litt le balcony .
 
Q: Was this the tank car?
 

A:  It was like a tank, but it  
was like a round.  And in fron
t on both sides, it had these 
-- there is a name f or it
.  It looked like a li
tt le balc ony, but it  
wasn't a balcony, with 
the litt le railing.  And I supp
os e y o u c ould st and on it, or  
if you were weary, as we 
were, we would sit down.  An
d since it was night, we wo
uld hold onto the railing, 
and since it wa
s night, we would doze
 off.  Because I rememb
er occasionally, the 
trains wer e  mov i ng very s lo
wly, but nevertheless, I remem
ber once in a while kin d  
of feeling t hat I'm s liding 
down.  I suppose when you'
re y o ung, you don't wor r y  
about it, but it was no
t always the safe
st way  of trav eling but 
we did it.  And, as I 
say, I did get to Munich, but
 by t h at t im e I had part e d 
company from them.  And, 
you know, I don't recall how 
I got back from Munich, be
caus e t h at was pr ob ably an 
experience; I wa s alone.  But 
again, wh at was helpful is 
that if I met some Jewish -- 
I remem b er  gett i ng on a trolley in Munic h
, and I don't remember
 how I paid for the 
trolle y.  I think what pr
obably happened is that
 somebody -- I said
 something, and 
somebody said to
 me, "Am ______ 
who?"  It means -- it 
was kind of a Jewish 
password, whic h meant are you from my
 nation, are you from my people? 
Because there were a couple of
 guys who I thin k paid fo
r me and asked me where I  
was going.  And I was telling 
them  that I was look ing f or 
-- I had an addr ess, but  it  
was already in the evening, 
so they suggested that they
 would take me to their 
house, t o wher ever they were s t ay ing in 
Munich.  And it's f
unny, there were two 
guys ; I didn't  k now t h em fr om  Adam, and 
I  said,  "O kay."  W e ll
, I had no choice 
any w ay.  I  could hav e, I s u ppose -- t o 
stay on the street
 would have been 
ridiculous.  They felt that it
 was too late for me
 to get to where I 
was going, so they 
took m e with t hem.  
And I thin k they had some kind
 of an apartme
nt, they must 
hav e gotten an apart m ent fr om a G erm an 
f am i ly.   And they  gav e me a room,  a n d 
there was no ot her --  ther e wer e jus t  th
e two of them .  You 
know, when I thin k 
about it, they could hav
e raped me.  It doesn't matter, 
they actually th
ey wer e v ery  
nice, they gave 
breakfast.  And I thin k 
they even took
 me to where I needed to go, 
and t h en I  found t hat  my fat h er  was not 
aliv e.  But I found 
a cousin, a distant 
cous in.  W ho was it ?  My mother 's c o
us in, who was  younge
r t han my mom.  
Anyway, she surviv ed, 
and she already had a boyfrien
d or something.  Because I 
rem ember she gav e me s o
m e money, s h e gave m e 
s om e c l ot hing.  I don' t  
rem ember.   And s he t o ld m e t h at  my  s i ster
' s  alive.   So that 
was  gr eat news,  so I 
somehow managed 
to get back to Bergen,
 to the DP camp. 
 And I'm trying to 
rem
ember  how I got  bac k t h er e, but I  don' t
 recall.  I probably 
t o ok  the sam e,  you 
know, chance with trains.
 
Q: Why did you go bac k?
 
A: To Ber g en ?
 
Q: Uh-huh.
 
A: Be c au s e  that was m y
 base.  I had no int
entions of not  going -- if I had f ound my  
father -- I didn't le
ave for good.  Even 
if I had found my fat
her, I would have gon e  
back.  I would have gone back
 to see how Esther is; I had
 m a de fr iends.  And t hey  

gav e m e c l ot hing, not all of 
it  was mine.  Besides, it  was my base, but I went back, 
so I went back. 
 Also, I knew that if my
 sister is alive . . .
 
Q: Did you never think 
about not going back?
 
A: Fr om wher e?
 
Q: From Munich?
 
A: Munich was al
so in Germany.
 
Q: Yeah.
 
A: And who want ed t o be in
 Munich?  I didn't 
have anybody in Munich.  Ther e was 
no reason f or m e t o st ay t h er e.  T hat c o
us in, may b e s h e ev en offer e d t o k e ep me, I  
wouldn't have.  I didn't 
know her that we ll.  
I felt much closer to
 t h e peo p le I had in 
Bergen, so -- but I also knew th
at if my s ist er 's  aliv e and 
I was registered
 on the list, 
then s h e would k n ow t hat I '
m in Bergen.   
And this is what hap
pened.   W h en I c a m e  
back  t o Bergen,  it m u st hav e
 been already  early J u ly.  
My s ist er  was  ther e.  She 
had c om e f r om Poland to Germ any.  Now,
 s h e was liber at ed by t he Russ ians, and 
bec aus e s he was liber ated by  t he Russ i
ans, she was sent -- the Russians sent  
most of the people who coul
d walk, they sent them ba
ck home.  Home, for my 
sist er was Poland, Szydlowi
ec, t he c it y wher e I was bo
rn, and that's where m y  
sist er went.   And she didn'
t st ay t here t h at long bec a
us e s h e was alone and sh e 
met with some unpleasantness.
  Some Polish neighbors 
were extremely nice t o  
her, and then s he walked out in
t o the s t reet  and s om e s.o. b.
 said t o her, "So Hit l er  
left some of you."  An
d my sister decided th
is is  not for her.  So
 she went to another 
-- she found another cousin 
who, by the way, is my 
cousin whom 
I knew much 
better and stayed with her for 
a little while.  An
d when she found out 
that I am alive, 
she decided to smuggle hers
elf to Germ any.  
And she did come 
with an aunt of 
mine, who also want ed to come to Germany.  
So she, my sister, and
 my aunt -- this 
was mother's youngest brothe
r's wife, who had lost two 
children but survived with 
her niece.  And she and 
her niece and my sister, 
whic h was a niece on her 
husband's side, they managed 
to smuggle themselv es thr
ough to Germany.  That 
was a little more diffic ult be
c a us e you had t o go t hr ough 
the Russian zone
, you see.   
And but I hav e a f eeling t h at my  au
nt who was an adult, s he had been m a rried 
befor e t he war, s h e had t w o c h ildr en, 
she may hav e had so
m e money with her  
already.  And they
 managed to come 
to Germany and to Be
rgen and to the DP 
cam p,  and my sist er 
found her wa y.  She knew wher
e I was, and wh
en I came, she  
was in that room 
with,  you know --  and, of
 course, we 
took her in.
 
Q: Do you remember coming into the room  
when s he was t her e t h e fir st t im e?  Do 
you remember the meet ing?
 
A: I probably -- you know, it 's 
funny.  I remember that I c
ouldn't recognize her.  Sh e 
was also very thin.  By that time, some of 
t h e gir ls  st art ed to gain
 weight.  It took me 
a muc h longer tim e t o gain weight .  I nev
er got real heavy, but
 I already looked a 

little better.  My
 sister  was still very thin, and she 
was - -  she's litt le.   My sist er was 
on ly 16, she was a kid.  And -- so I thin k 
I  was in a st ate of  s h oc k when I saw her. 
She looked so vulnerabl
e, you know, so smal
l.  But s he' s not  
a vulnerable person, 
she's very strong.  She's a st rong woma
n.  She was ev en t h
en strong.  It was 
wonderful to have my sister.  And then
, then we had some 
rough times because 
we, you know -- well
, first of all, I had to 
tell her t hat  I t h ought 
that my father 's aliv e 
and he is n't .   So we cr ied ab
out that, and it was 
a mixed thing.  It 
was good to find 
her, it  wa s probably wonderful for her to 
find me.  But, you know, until my sister 
came, I remember  we were looking for things
, but we were 
in a k i nd  of a - -  it wa s  
kind of a never- n ev er land.  
I don't know how to 
explain it .  With m y sist er 's com i ng,  
th e r ea l it y t ha t  t h is  is it , th e t w o  of  u s.  A n
d at  that point - -  and 
at that, I was lucky, I 
had a s is t er.  T h er e wer e s om e of us wh
o survived all by them
selves.  The realit y 
set in that this is it, that I'
ll nev er my mot h er.   That I ' ll 
never s e e my fat her.  T hat I'm 
nev er going to s e e my kid sist er or  my k i d br ot her.  T h at was it.  
And in that sense, I 
think that was hard.  We al
so started to fight, and we 
fought mostly because of 
ideas.  She wa s going to go
 to Palestine.  She came
 in, she had been -- when sh e 
was in  Po land until she came
, she was involv ed with a 
group of young people who 
were being already -- I don'
t want to us e t h e wor d " indo
ctr i nat ed, "  but y eah, they  
were.
 
Q: The Zionist group?
 
A: Yea h.
 
Q: What was the name of t he gr oup?
 
A:  I don't rememb
er.  I belonged to a Zionist organi
zation during the war, it  was  
Dr or.  It was probably the 
general Zionists. 
 I was not oppose
d to goin g t o  
Palest ine, but I had a 
f i ght with her .   T he r e as on wa
s sim p le.   W hen she cam e, sh e 
also brought a letter from my 
uncle here in Americ a.  I 
had four uncles in Am eric a, 
and aft er the war t h ey were 
looking for family. 
 And when she was in Szydlowiec, 
she f o und lett ers f r om  my unc l e wr itt e n 
to the Jewish communi
ty  as k i ng whet her  
anybody by our na
me from our family  is  alive. So she managed to
 get the letters  
and the address.  And 
when s h e cam e, s he br ought all of
 it  s o t h at  we c ou l d wr it e  
to our family and tell 
them who we are and where we  ar
e.  So I said to my sister, 
"Nina" . . .
 
Q: Her name's Nina?
 
A: Nina, her name's Nina. 
 Her name actually
 was Piena, but w
hen she came -- 
Piena, I  don't  k now how s h
e got the name.  
Her name was Sabe
na, but when she 
was little she couldn't pr onounce her name, and when 
people asked her what her 
name is, she probably said, "P
iena."  So t he name st uc k ,  and we c a lled her Piena .  
When she got to Israel, she 
found out that Piena means 
corner.  Well, she wasn't 
going t o be called c or n er, s o 
she changed it to Nina, t
hat's how -- but anyway, my 
sister and I started to
 argue, because I felt that we
 had four uncles in Am erica and 

we s hould go t o Am er ic a.  If we don't 
-- oh,  ther e was  anot her reas on, and I  do 
have to be honest
 about it.  If we were
 permitted to go to 
Palest ine from the DP 
cam p s -- and when I  say "we," I don't me
an j ust myself, I mean most of the 
sur v iv or s of  the Holocaust.  At
 that time if they had opened
 the gates to Palestine, I 
thin k that 90 percent of us would have go
ne to Palestine.  
Ther e would have bee n  
no question about it.  Given what
 we went  thr o ugh, all of us 
fe lt  th at t h is  is t h e p la ce  
to go.  So I didn't hav e an
y quar rel with her  on that 
subject, but I was look ing at  
realit y and my s is t er was not. 
 T h e Br it is h wer e 
not letting anybody 
in, and it didn't 
take much time for us to find out what wa
s going on in Palestine.
  And I didn't want 
to enter already.  I ne
eded -- you asked me 
why I wasn't ge
tting out.  Except for th e 
trip that I took, I stayed in 
Be rgen.  I'm beginning to th
ink -- I wasn't inter e st ed i n  
gett ing out of Ber g en bec aus
e I couldn't st and t o s e e Germ an children.  I couldn' t  
stand to see Germ an -- I hated -- I hated th
e kids bec ause t h ey  wer e not  my s i ster.  
I was very -- I knew it was pr obably a very 
normal feeling for a lot 
of us, an d I didn' t  
like those feelings.  I didn't want -- I needed to
 get out of Germ
any, and I kept 
saying t o m y sister,  "W e have
 a c h anc e t o get  out of  Ger m any. "  My  unc l e wr ot e us  
immediately that he's alread
y applying.  That 
as soon as they pe
rmit anybody to 
come to Americ a, we will be
 the first people to
 get the papers.  
My uncle was ver y  
wealthy, and he wr ote; he said
 he has c o ntac ts.  He's go
ing t o m ak e s ur e that th e 
P o lis h c orr ido r  wa s a f t er a ll o p en.   He wa s 
going to make 
s ur e t hat his niec es - -  w e  
were t h e f ir st ones t hat he f ound out that we
 were aliv e -- that his t w o niec es were 
going t o c o me.  So I k new t h
at we c a n go t o  Am er ic a, a
nd I knew we c an get out of 
Germany.  And I said to
 my sister, "Look, if  
things change in
 Israel," in Palestine, it  
wasn't Israel, "we'll go to Pa
le stine.  I agree."  I said 
to her, "You 
are my younger 
sist er, I'm older .  We'r e going 
to do what I say."  This is
 what I thought I have the 
right to say.  And she -- well, first we fo
ught  bec a us e s he s a id
 to me, "
It doesn't 
matter what you're saying
.  I am not going 
anywhere but Pa lestine.  Nobody will 
send me t o  anot her cr em ator ium. "  She wa
s absolut e ly convince
d t hat if she goe s  
to any other plac
e but Pale sti
ne, the same thin g that ha
ppened to her 
parents is  
going t o happen t o her .  She' s not
 going any w here, f or g et  it.  
 
Q: Did a lot of people belie
ve that way, or . . .
 
A: Oh, she wasn't the only one
.  As I said, look, most of
 us would have gone t o  
Palest ine.  Some of t h at f e
eling was t h er e.  I didn't c om e
 to America with a feeling 
that t h is is the best plac e f or m e.   I c am e
 t o  Am er ic a bec a us e it was bett er t h an 
being in G e rmany.   I m ean,  I 
want ed t o get out of G erm an
y, I would ha
ve gone to 
the moon.  And I definitely w
ould have gone to Palestine if
 I could, but I couldn't. 
So the fights between us -- and 
that' s k i nd of, it took it s 
toll.  So what did I do ? 
Ther e was no point f ight ing her.
  I  figured she's only -- she's 
a kid.  I'm going to take 
care of the two of us, and 
we'll manage.  Fortunately for 
me, my girlfriend, Esther, 
went to Poland to see what
's going on there.
  She t ook a tr ip, s h e br ought s om e  
pictures back.  Ta
lking about my girl
friend, Esther.  Sh
e came back and she 
dec i ded s h e needs  t o  -- gee, I 
didn't know I had that much 
t o  tell you.   I 'm sorr y. 

She decided that she knew 
that she probably could go, 
get to Palestine legally, 
bec aus e she was  ac cept ed at 
the Univ ersity before the 
war and she ha
d family in 
Pale stine.  But she also knew
 that it would probably be be
tter to be in the Am erican 
zone.  So she managed -- and 
also, things were 
easier in the Amer
ican zone.  The 
Bergen camp was not an easy camp.  When 
winter set in, we were
 cold.  We were 
not so very we ll taken care
 of, I found out later.  So
 she managed to get over to 
Sz czecin  near Frankfurt, wh ic
h was clos e to a DP camp 
and sent for me.  Well, I 
want ed t o t ak e m y s i st er.  T her e was no t a lk
ing to my sister.   My 
sister by that time 
had joined a Zionist organi
zation in Bergen. 
 She was  going t o sc hool,  s he was  
lear ning Hebr ew.  But I dec i ded okay, s o 
I said to her, "Look,
 I'm going to go see 
what I can do."  So I went
 over to Sz czecin
, it must have been
 about No vember of 
1945.  Don't ask me what 
I did in between there and 
Bergen; I hone
stly don't 
remember, honest.  But I did go 
to -- as I said, I went Szcz
ecin.  In fact, Henry came 
to get me.  Again, he was just
 a friend.  He was 
a ver y good fr iend of Est her and he 
had at that  point enr o lled at
 the Univ ers it y.  He was al
ready in Szcz
ecin, he was 
studying m edic i ne at t he Univ er s i ty of F r ank
furt, and Esther ask
ed him t o c ome and 
get me.  And so he c am e 
and got me and I we nt to
 Szczecin.  When I came 
Sz czecin, Esther already had a room that 
r e nt ed with a Ger man
 family, and it was 
mov e d in.  And I f o und wor k, I st art ed wo
rk ing t hr o ugh Henr y wh
o had a gir lfr ien d  
whose sister worked in
 the Hias.  My husban
d had a lot of girlfr
iends after the war, 
but that's okay.  And then -- 
s o I start e d wor king t he Hias.
  Well, you know what the 
Hias is, and when I went
 to work to the 
Hias, there wa s -- aga
in, you see, I was 
ver y, what do y o u c a ll it ?  
What 's  the word?  T her e was  
one thing on my mind.  I 
want ed t o get out of G e rmany.  I wa
s j us t  c oncentr at ing on one t h ing.
 
Q: Very focused.
 
A: Very focused.  I certainly was.  So I 
was working the Hias, a
nd hoping that  this  
will help me.  And, indeed, the 
first papers that ca
me to the office 
of Hias were for 
me and my sister fr
om  my unc l e who late
r I found out, as I 
said, he was a very 
wealthy man.  And he pro
bably was able to get his c
ongressman to 
send throug h 
the papers.  Whatever it is, 
my papers came
 in  first.  And then, of course, other 
paper s c a me.  So I k new t h at I ' m going t o
 go t o Am er ica.  Now,
 what do about my 
sist er ?  In t he m eant i me, I wa
s going back and f ort
h to Be rgen.  First of all, when I 
came to Szczecin, I regist
ered myself and I registered 
my sister, as if she -- 
because she had to li
ve in the Am eric an 
z one t o go t o Am er ic an.  So s h e was  
regist er ed, the paper s were wr
itt e n, s he was in Ber g en.  
I brought her once or twic e 
to visit me when I we
nt ther e, but God helped us, we
 were called t o  the Am er ic an  
Cons ulat e.  And f irst ,  I think 
to the doctor for ex
amination, so I broug
ht my sister.  I 
don't remember how, so
mebody brought her; 
she cam e .  She went  wit h m e to the 
doctor, she went with me to
 the Consulate. And we were is sued
 probably already 
the perm i ss ion,  t he papers t o 
come to Am erica,  
and we were 
supposed to wait for 
tickets because at that poin
t nothing was yet leaving Ge
rm any f or  Am er ic a.  This  
must have been March.
  Now, m y sist er went back, 
and she said that she needs to 

take care of things. 
 And we were waiting 
to hear, and I think th
at I got -- when I -- I 
don't remember exactl
y how I heard . . .

Tape 2
 
Q: This is Tape 2, Side 1 inte
rview with Bella Tovey.  I'm 
Nina Ellis.  It's June 10th, 
1996.  
 
A: On one of thos e tr
ips back t o Bergen when I was tryi
ng t o get my s ist er to eit her  
com e  or  go, I f o und a lett er wr itt e n t o Est
her  from  Lolak ,  her  f i
rst boyfriend
.  And I 
rem ember I ran lik e --  I don't r e mem ber , 
but I made it back t o 
S zcz e c in wit h in a  
short t im e, and I br ought her t h at lett er.  
He was alive.  He had
 survived in Russia 
with his father, and I 
was the one wh o brough
t her that letter.  
That must have been 
sometime early in 
1946, maybe February, one of 
t h os e befor e .  And then I  
remember, of course, th
at I kept saying to Esther, "I 
have to wait till 
Lolak comes.  I 
have to meet him."  I ne
ver did then, because what 
happened is th
at we were 
issued tickets,  and the first sh
ip, I think, came to this  country in April or later April.  
And our ship was 
s uppos ed t o leav e Br em erhav e n, 
t hat's  the port  of  Brem en, I  
think on t he 10t h of M a y.  Becaus e I c am e 
to Am er ic a on the 24
th of May 1946 on 
the second ship.  In between
, my sister while I wa s runni
ng back and forth said to 
me, "Bella, I'm not going
 t o Americ a.  W e ar e leav ing 
in t w o days. "  That m u st have 
been April, still late April, 
and I already knew 
that she's supposed 
to come with me, 
too.  "I 'm leav ing t onight or
 tomorrow with Aleah Allah (p
h) to Palestine."  She was 
16 y e ars  old.  T h e bill t h
at Tr um an work ed on t o c o mmi
t  the c h ildr en t o go t o 
Pale stine was apparently  the 
British agr e ed.   If y o u r em e
m ber  hist ory,  the Br itis h 
did perm it childr en t o be take
n t o  Palest ine, and m y s i
ster was one of those who 
was per mit t ed to go bec aus e s he was no
t yet 18; she was 16.  So we parted 
company.  Of course, I didn't 
realize t hat we parted c om p
any for s u ch a long t i me.  
As  f ar as  I was  c o nc er ned,  
I was  going t o  Amer ic a,  and 
t h en I was going t o  t ak e a 
walk  through Pale stine one of
 these days, you know, when 
things straighten out. 
And I came back and I couldn
't wait for Lolak to come 
from Russia either because 
th e s h ip wa sn 't wa it in g for 
me.  And I remember that -- I do remember how this was 
or ganiz e d.  The Am er ic ans took us  to a s p
ecial place, it must 
hav e been som e k i nd 
of a sc hool that was  t ur ned 
int o som e d orm it or ie s.  W e  
had to report 
a good week 
before the ship left from Br
emen.  They took us, we  sp
ent there a coupl
e of days. 
After that, they put us on tr
ains, and those trains took
 us -- when I say "us," I'm 
talk ing about -- I think I have pict
ures from those trains.  They
 took us by train, all of  
those people wh o were going 
to take that ship
 to Br emen.  In
 Bremen we were 
again put up in some kind 
of a barrack or something fo
r about a day or so.  Then 
we wer e put on t h e ship.  T h es e s h ips wer e 
-- I think that what they did for us, they 
transported us the way they
 were transporting soldiers back home, becaus e that 
was the only way.  This was 
only '46, and we wer e
 put 
on a s h ip.  Then the s h ip 
was Marine -- the first one, I think wa
s Marine Perch and I came on Marine 
F let c her , or  the other way ar ound.  T hes e 
were the two ships th
at were going back  
and f orth bringing s o me of t he fir st ref u
gees t o Am er ic a.  And we wer e on the 
oc ean f or 14 day s, 14 m is er able days bec a
us e I was  ver y s eas ick, and t hen we 
cam e t o Amer ic a.  And Henr y c a me on t h
e same ship with me
, had nothin g to do 

with me.  He, too, wanted to
 get out of Germany even 
though he wa
s in medica l 
school.  And he was able to
 get  t o Am er ic a wit hout  t
he help of anybody through 
what was called the corporat
e affidavit.  What happened is
 that the Joint was trying 
to brin g some refugees 
to Am erica, and since they were
 trying to fill the quota, they 
knew that the quota 
is n't going to be filled, we'll 
be lost and no
t everybody had  
spons or s.  So what t h e J o in
t was doing, they we
re getting out corp
or ate aff i davit s.  
What it m e ans appar e nt ly t h
at companies, some compan
ies got together and they 
sponsored.  So Henry wa
s not sponsored 
by  a f a mily  m em b er, b ut he was 
sponsored by Join t.  
And he came to this country,
 and we were 
-- since he was a 
friend of m i ne, we k e pt  toget h er on that s h
ip.  And we did not, as
 I said, this was not 
at t hat point, there was  nothin
g between us yet.  But I think it did 
bring us together, 
and t h en in Am er ic a in
 the beginning when we wer e her e.
  Tot a lly t w o lost souls.  
Not knowing any English.  Yo
u know, just feelin
g ver y  los t.  I  didn't  get  the bes t  
reception in my family, alth
ough, again, in retrospect
 probably ther
e were many 
things I didn't under
stand.  But . . .
 
Q: T e ll m e  about  c o ming -- y o u arr iv e d 
in New York?  Tell 
me about,
 do you 
remember, Bella, was t hat
 an im portant moment?
 
A: Well, I remember -- I do remember so
mething.  I remember
 the day when the 
ship came to t h e --  when 
it came close to the port of  New York.  I remember 
standing on the -- by that time I wa s feeling 
better.  I think the 
sea must have gotten 
calm er, and I was already not -- because I was 
sick.  I wa s a mess.  I couldn't eat.  I 
remember a diffic ult passage, 
but the last couple days th
ings were ea
sier.  And I 
rem ember look ing at t he lig
hts of  New Yor k.   You hav e
 to understand we came 
Germ any.   Germ any was dar k, it was devas
t at ed.  T h er e was nothing.  Suddenly I  
thought I am comi
ng to an absolute par
adise.  And I also reme
mber because I must 
hav e s e en from a dist anc e th
e r o ads and c a rs.  Car s goi
ng, they looked like little 
match boxes because it wa s 
far away, but so m
any of t h em.  And I rem ember  w e  
were so overwhelmed, it 
was a beautiful an
d scar y sight.  It
 was absolutely 
beautiful, I do remember that.  I'll never fo
rget that first 
impr es s ion of New Yor k fr om  
the s hip.  And t h en it  was Fr iday I rem em b er
 when we arr i v ed, s o my f our unc l es  
were wait in g.  Some, probabl
y other members of the family
.  Mostly also a little 
curiosit y, you know.  
But it looked like, you know, we
 were the first or the second 
gr oup t o arr iv e f r om  c o nc entr at ion camps, so
 there was a litt le bi
t of that.  And I do 
remember saying good
-bye to Henry.  I 
don't -- I suppose Henr
y was taken by the 
Hias, because he didn't ha
ve anybody to, you 
know, nobody was wa
it ing for him. 
But my uncle arranged with his 
son, who he was married.  
I thin k he had, his wife 
was pr egnant.  It was a y oung c o uple, s o t h ey
 took me to their 
hous e in Br ookly n.  
They were very religious
.  Somehow he thought that 
because I'm coming from 
Europe that I'm very religious, 
so they took me.  But they 
felt that I'm observant, so 
they took me for Shabbat to 
their house.  And I 
have t o say t h at 
my cousin's wife  
was -- m y cousin and his wife
 were very nice 
t o me.  Part ic ular ly s he, M ir i am, I  
didn't have much lang
uage with her.  She didn't sp
eak Polish; she didn't spe a k 

German.  I don't speak Yi
ddish, I could unde
rstand some.  So were probably 
comm unic a ting.  She was speak i ng in Yidd
ish, I was ans w er ing her in G er m an .  
And I spent that Saturday, 
that Shabbat, with th
em.  And then on
 Sunday, I don't 
remember what I did on 
Sunday.  She may have go
ne with me shopping or 
something.  I probably called 
Henry in Hias, although I do
n't remember that.  And I 
do r em ember t h at on Monday, I was  tak en 
by my cousin who wo
rked in my uncle's 
fact or y t o t he fact ory.  My 
uncle owned a jewelry factory 
-- not  a j e welr y f act ory, it  
was making bracelets 
for watches.  The name of the fi
rm was Jacobi & Bend er.  It 
was a v ery , v ery  big f act or y at t hat point. 
 My unc l e, as  I t o
ld  y ou ,  wa s a ver y  
wealthy man.  He employed
 a couple of hundred people,
 probably.  
So anyway, I 
was brought in to his office, an
d I had a problem with my 
uncle anyway.  When I first 
saw him, I don't remember that
 impression when I 
first saw when I go
t off that ship. 
I think I was probably overwhel
med, but when I walked into 
his office I went into a 
state of shock.  He looked li
ke my father, it was my father's br ot her.  My father  had 
fiv e br other s.  He look ed m o
st like my uncle -- I mean, this uncle looked most like 
my father.  And here 
was this man who was 
this big, rich uncl
e who I didn't have 
any language with.  I couldn't ta
lk to him, my b
enefactor, if you will
.  He brought me 
to this country, and he
 looks like my fatherbut it 's not my father
.  So I think it had an 
effect on me, it was hard
 really.  He -- I don'tremember exactly what was  
happening.  Things
 were going on probably, but he 
sent me with a cousin  of his 
who was a refugee from Germ
any.  He had brought -- 
we had some family in 
Germany apparently, and my 
uncle did brin g -- you know, 
he was a good
 m a n, bu t  
he was in sensit iv e.  And I don't thin k he 
meant -- he meant to be
 a good person to 
me, but he just didn't do th
e right  thing, per h aps not k
nowin g how to do the right 
thing.  But, as I said, he br
ought his family from Germany,
 som e of his cousins,  yo u 
know, before the war.  A
nd one of them, he
r name was Dora, 
had already was 
working already in the factory for him. 
 She was workin g in
 the office, and she 
spoke German.  So I had a 
common language with her, 
and he sent her with me 
shopping.  Be cause I didn't 
have clot hing, I had --  I re
ally didn't look very 
presentable.  So she went 
with me to the stores, I re
m e mb er, in Ne w Yo rk.  A n d h e  
probably gave her a carte bl
anche or whatever 
and she bought me clothing.  But 
she was afraid of him, to
o, I suppose, so she was ve
ry careful.  And I can 
understand, so she bou
ght me three pairs of panties 
and two bras.  In other words, 
she was very -- she wanted 
t
o m ak e s ur e t h at I had 
enough for a b
eginning.  And 
aft er t hat, t hat ev ening, my ot
her unc l e -- I  had, as I  told 
y ou,  four unc l es.   M y ot her  
unc l e who was his  -- who was 
Uncle Max's, the rich uncle
's -- he was t h e one who 
was contracted.  He  was the one who wa s ta
king care of things
.  He was a very 
re lig i o us  J e w.  He  wa s  th e 
one whose son's hous
e I went to Br ookl
yn.  So it was 
that unc l e who lived at that 
point in the Br onx.  He had 
lost his f am i ly in G erm any,  
but he had two s o ns.  Not 
G ermany, dur i ng t he war in Po
land, but he had two sons  
that he managed to bring to
 Am eric a before the war.  
So lived in  the Bronx, that 
religious uncle.
 
Q: What was his nam e?
 

A: His name was Uncle Favish (ph), and 
Uncle Favish was a ve
ry religious, ultra-
Orthodox Jew.  And he rent
ed a room for me 
in t h e Br onx s om e w
here not far from 
where he was with some pers
on.  And I think he
 was stingy, and 
perhaps he didn't 
want to exploit his 
brother again.  Bu
t he was not -- again, 
there are al
l kinds of 
mem ber s in t h e f am i ly .  He r ent ed a r o om 
f o r me for $35, and he
 paid this woman. 
Her name was Mrs. Fox, he
 gav e her $15 and said t o  
her -- maybe he gave her 
$20.   But I remember  that I had -- no, I 
think he gave her $15. 
 An d h e sa id  t ha t  
when I come, I'
ll pay the rest.  In othe
r words, he didn't have
 brains to pay for one  
month's rent for me.  I don'
t know where he thought I was going to 
get the $20 from, 
but t h at' s what he t o ld her. 
 So I come into this room, I get this furnished.  And,  by 
the way, it was very difficult
 to get room s in New York after the war.   So, you know, 
the fact that he found me a r
oom was a nice thin g.  I move 
into this -- I 
get into this  
room, this  is Monday evening,
 and I'm suppose
d to come to
 work Tuesday morning 
to my uncle's factory.  So I come in, 
and Mrs. Fox t a kes me -- t he f irst t h ing she 
does f or m e is  s h e t ak es me to the bat hr oo
m to show me how to
 flush a toilet.  And 
I started to cry, because I knew
 how to flush a to
ilet.  I didn't come
 from  --  when  I  
start e d t o c r y and I s a id to her, s h e s p ok e 
G e rman.  And I said t o her ,  "Why are you 
showing me how to
" -- She said to me that when 
s h e c am e t o Am er ic a,  s h e didn't  
know how to flush a 
toilet.  So I said, "Well,  you 
know" -- she came
 from Hungary 
somewhere or somethin
g.  I said, "Well,  you know, th
ere may have been places in 
Poland wher e they didn't ha
ve toilets in your time, an
d maybe even in my tim e .  
But, you know, also didn't stan
d still in these 30, 40 year
s t h at you've 
been here." 
And I -- we had a bathroom 
in our house, and
 we even h
ad a toilet and it  flushed 
water.  But anyway, 
so that was my beginning.  She 
also didn't let me use th e 
Fr igidair e, bec aus e that wa
s not in the agreement, whic
h meant that I had to eat 
out.  So I had a rough beginn
ing, if you will.  You know, 
if you can understand it. 
Funny thing is  it wasn't , I'm sure, it wa
sn't meant that way.
  I had -- I started 
work ing, and I,  y o u k now, I  got  m y f ir st 
chec k and I m a de m y arr a ngem ents.   I had 
my rough couple of months in the beginni
ng.  Actually, I have
 to say that my 
wealthy uncle took me to his house finally.  
On July 4th, the fa
ctory closed for o ne 
week.  And he had told me be
f or e that he is  going to 
take me to hi
s house for a 
week so I can meet his wi
fe and his da
ught
er and s pend a week in his hous e o n  
Long Island.  He lived in
 Lawr ence, Long 
Island.  So I we
nt with him.  
 
Q: You hadn't been to hi
s house before that?
 
A: No, no, no.  This was the 
first time I was in
vited to his house 
to spend a week.  
And I we nt to his house.  Oh, 
I want to tell you somethin
g else that happened to me 
whic h very interesting.  
I was very upset 
in the beginning be
cause I couldn't 
manage my money.  Later on, when I c o ul
d adm it t o Henry t hat m y fam i ly was no t  
treating me the best way, 
Henry would -- he ma
naged much better 
having come to 
strangers.  But so
metimes this works ou
t.  So anywa y, but at
 one point when I was 
sitting and eating my lunch, and my lunc
h c ons ist e d for the f irst c ouple of weeks  
until I could get myself  -- bec
ause I was making $
18 a week after ta
xes.  And I had 

to pay $35 for rent and the 
first $20, I had, too.  So 
I was having trouble managing, 
and I  at e m y m ain dinner in t h
e autom at.  But  for lunc h, I  
couldn't afford
 t o go out,  
and I couldn't keep an
ything in the fridge.  So I bought
 a loaf of br ead in wax paper ,  
and I would t ak e t w o piec es
 of bread and I would wr ap 
it  in  the wax paper.  And 
when people sat down to
 have lunch at work, I woul
d take my two 
pieces and I 
would eat my two pieces of bread.  And I 
was f eeling sorry f or myself, t o be very 
honest .  I wr ot e t o m y gir lfr iend,  Est h er,  that
 I wished that I were back in Szczecin.  
So one day, Dora ca
me over, and I was si
tting and I was probabl
y feeling sorry for 
myself so I looked say.  
Or maybe I wa s crying, and 
she said, "_____
____?"  "Why 
are you crying?"  So I couldn't take it any
more, so I opened the 
two pieces of bread  
to show her that I'm eating
 -- you know, after all I went
 through, I'm al
so telling you 
that in 1946, I wasn't quit e 
20, so I wa sn't that grown up
.  So I was feeling sorry for 
myself.  I thin k that if  I had been mo
re adult, I would have
 managed my uncle 
better, too.  You know, I coul
d, but I didn't.  So
 I opened those two 
pieces of bread, 
and I said, "_______
______."  "That's why I'
m crying."  And so 
she got very
 ups et. 
You know, I was telling her th
at I was eating two pieces 
of dry bread.  You know,  
this is my lunch.  So she 
got a hold of me and dragged 
to my uncle's office.  And 
then s h e s t art ed t o t a lking --  I didn't  k
now what the hell she 
wa s saying.  And he 
looked at her, looked at me
.  And he pulled out $50 from  
his poc k et,  and he told her  
to tell me that -- oh, the first thing she sa
id to him, because I 
had as ked her, that 
they are not paying me enough
.  That if they paid me a 
little more, sh
e would -- you 
know, I could manage.  So he said, and I 
understood that, beca
us e my Englis h wa s  
-- I was beginning to u
nderstand.  This  is what th
ey pay here, meaning -- now, 
maybe this  was policy that
 he wasn't tellin
g anybody wh at to 
pay me.  I was 
working in the wr apping depar
tment, and that wa s what th
ey were payi
ng.  By the 
way, I was working on accord
, this wa s piecework.  An
d eventually, I wa s able to 
make more money 
because I quick.  But 
at that point, I was 
still having trouble, s o  
he gav e m e t he $50.  
So he said to her, bu
t he can give me $50
.  And he s a id t o  
me to her, through her
 that if I need more money, I 
should come him.  Now, yo u 
see, t h is is wher e he was not 
s ens it iv e.  I nev er went bac k
 to him for another $50 or 
for another $10.  Wh
at he should have 
done -- see, when he di
ed in 1966, I came 
to t h
is c ountry in ' 4 6.  So t hat ' s 20 y e ars  
later.  When he died, he
 left me $20,000 in 
his will.  I mean, I was 
not the only one.  He
 left for all the su
rvivors, for all the 
childr en who s urv iv ed, bec aus e 
I and m y s i ster and t hen la
ter on he fo
und a couple 
of nephews.  There were a couple of peopl
e wh o surviv ed from my family.  All of 
thos e, t her e were about eight 
of us --  all of us wer e 
given some money
.  Yo u know, 
he left them in the 
will.  He was a very we
althy man, but, you kn
ow, this not even a 
Jewish -- Jews usually leave t
heir estates 
to their family
.  But he did ha
ve in his will, 
he left for all of t he c h ildr en who s urv ived, 
for all those, some money.  And he left 
me -- now, if he had 
given m e in 1946 $1,
000 and send me to 
school to teach me 
how t o ty pe.  I did go t o, of c our s e, ev enin
g classes, and I st art
ed t o lear n Englis h,  
and I was r eading.  So, y o u k now, but if 
he had giv e n me a k i
nd of a help in the  
beginning, it would hav
e been worth more t
han the $20,000 in  1966
.  It was nice to 

get the $20,000, and he wa s 
working and earning 
good money.  And 
it was -- I  th in k  
it was -- I want to te
ll you something nice about his 
wife.  His wife, 
when my uncle 
took me to his home in Law
rence, Long Island, I took 
my little va
lise with my 
belongings and my aunt wait
ed for me.  She may have 
met me befo
re, she may 
have com e  to t he f act ory.   
But I didn't -- I wa
s never in their hou
se.  I had a room, 
and t hey welc om ed m e v ery 
nic e ly, and s he cam e in 
and she ask ed did I nee d  
anyt hing.  And I s a id,  "No," and she wa
nt ed t o s ee what I hav e.  She lo ok ed 
through my clothing, 
and s h e s a id, "T om orr o w we'r e goi
ng to go shop
ping."  And 
she did not  tak e me t o  Klines
 on 14th Str eet  or whatev
er.  She took m e the sam e  
stores where she sh
opped; she was a la dy.  She s
hopped in Sa ks Fifth Avenue or 
wherever.  Sh e took me 
those stores, and she bought 
me some very
 beautiful 
things.  She bought  m e s h oes t hat I wor e 
f or year s, and clot hing.
  That I remember,  
she was, you know -- so 
that was my beginning in 
Am erica in that sense.
 
Q: Did you start  to s oc i aliz e 
and hav e fr iends  and meet 
other people fair ly quickly, 
or did it t a k e a while
?  You k new Henr y, and did y ou 
k e ep in t o uc h wit h him and --  
how did y o u s ort of . . .
 
A: Yes.
 
Q: . . . get beyond j u st 
working in the factory?
 
A: Mostly  it was I st
ayed -- in the beginni
ng, I didn't make fri
ends, although I am a 
sociable person.  But mostly 
I s a w Henr y.  Henr y and I 
start e d getting c los er,  and 
we became a kind of a twosome.  I don'
t thin k so.  Henry'
s very good friend 
surviv ed the war and 
came to Americ a.  He worked
 in Philadelphia,
 but he would 
com e for week ends.  So oft e n the thr e e of 
us would go to the z o
o.  We would go t o  
museums.   I remember Henry 
took me to Radio 
City the firs
t time, dro
pped me off 
there.   It was a beaut if u l c it y
.  I worked, I started to -- I 
found out that 
my sister was 
turned back.  Th
ey attached an illegal 
transport to the lega
l transports, and my 
sister was sent back from Marseilles.  Wh
en I came to Americ
a, my sister was 
supposed to be in Palestine.
  It tur ned out t hat s he wa
s back in Bergen becaus e 
they had turned back the w
hole transport because, yo
u know, the Ha
ganah was -- 
well, they needed to do it. 
 They were attaching so
me illegals to the lega l 
transports.  And so, but th
en about a half a year late
r my sister ended up in 
Palest ine.  And I re
member I st ar ted s e nding her 
pac k ages becaus e 
things were  
rough in Palest ine.  Did I 
make friends?  Yeah, I thin
k what happened is t hat I 
started to make fri
ends with people who su
rviv ed the camps.  
The same probably -- 
as a matter of fact, the first years in Ne
w York, most of my 
friends, and, in fact, 
many of them I just met 
somebody wh o reminded me -- 
I found them 
work.  Many 
of t hem  ended up wor king in my unc l e' s 
f act ory, bec ause t h ey
 came in and they 
needed work.  So I would, you know, a
sk whether there is 
a need for 
somebody, 
and they would co
me to work.  
So I became friendly with 
one girl whom
 I brought in 
and we sat across from ea
ch other and we 
spent time talk i
ng while we were  
work ing.  And s he was a concentrat i on c am p
 s urv iv or, she was already m arr ied. 

Some other friends 
came from Germany.  In th
e beginning, I'm just trying t o  
remember, Henry and I did no
t get married till 1949.  An
d I lived in the Br onx and 
Henry lived in Br ooklyn, and that 
was a little difficul
t.  So I finally moved to Br ooklyn.  
I didn't like the lady I lived 
with, so it was not 
a pleas ant s it uat ion.
  It was not bad,  
but I didn't -- so I mo
ved into a much nice
r place, where the la
dy permitted me to 
us e t h e fr idge.  I  c ould mak e 
m ys e lf a c up of  c off ee,  a c u p 
of tea.  And eventually, I 
moved in where Henry stayed
.  Henry found a wonderful
 family, Am erican Jews 
who came in, their daughter 
got married.  They had a r
oom.  I unders
tand Mr. and 
Mrs. Rhinehart (ph) was wonder
ful to Henry.  They took 
him in like a son.  And then 
when Henry and I got 
kind of engaged and 
when we were going 
to get married, I 
mov e d in.  And aft er we wer e m arr ied, we
 stay ed wit h  the Rhin
eharts for several 
year s, and then we m anaged t o
 get an apar t ment in Br oo
klyn.  So we moved into 
this apartm ent, and at  that point,  as I 
said, I wa s working.  And He nry, he ha d 
started going to Br ooklyn Co
llege in '48 just before we 
were married. 
 And he wa s 
going to school, he was ridi
ng a bike every day, so that
 he could save
 some money 
on tr ans por tat i on.   But  thes e wer e good
 years, and, as I sa
id, he was probably 
older t h an many of t h e st udent s at t hat 
point, exc ept f o r som e soldier s who ha d 
come back.  You know, they were vetera
ns, GIs who were going 
to school.  So I 
think Henr y  bef r iended a few - -
 I t h ink Henr y may have 
had t w o fr iends who were 
Am er ic an.  It star ted bec aus e 
they st udy ing toget her, but 
my friends at that point, 
most  of t h em wer e people who sur v iv ed 
the concentration camp
.  I think it was 
probably still very im portant to
 be -- we spoke Poli sh with
 each other.  That was not 
so good for my 
English, although, as 
I said, I did become fr
iendly with 
some people 
at work.  The first 
person who really  
befriended me, intere
stingly enough, was an 
Irish lady.  She was much ol
der than I, her name
 was Sar ah.  I do
n't remember her 
-- who said t h at I  reminded 
her  of  her  when s h e came 
to this coun
try.  I wa s 
freckled, I probably could have 
passed for Iris h at that po
int.  I had kind of reddish 
hair .  And s he r em em b er ed her s e lf, more or le
ss that way, so sh
e was very friendly 
to me.  And then ther e wer e a c ouple of It
alian gir ls, I do r em em b er as a r es u lt of  
becoming friendly with Toni
 and Annett e -- that was t
heir name, because we had 
lunch together.  That
 I would come home and show 
of f my Englis h t o Henry,  and  
Henr y was  muc h m or e m et ic u lous about  
his -- about everythi
ng.  He was muc h
 
mor e of a perfect i onis t.  I was  pick ing th
ings up, and I would 
say -- this was even 
before we were marr
ied.  And I would say to him th
at I  am going t o -- m ay b e  we 
should go and see a picture.
  An d He nry didn't unders
tand why I wanted to see a 
pict ur e, becaus e t h at  was pict ure, a m o v i
e.  Or if I wanted to make myself a 
sandwic h.  But I was picking 
up the English that wa s spok
en in the fact
ory by som e  
of these people.
 
Q: So me of the people then th
at you were mixing wi th 
were, a lot of them also 
imm i gr ant s,  sound lik e.   T his Ir ish woman . .  .
 
A: This Irish woman.
 

Q: . . . and some Italian girls.
 
A: The Italian girls we re
 bor n in t h is c o untr y.
 
Q: Oh, they were
 born here?
 
A: But they were It
alians, and they lived in Br ookl
yn.  And if yo
u've ever been 
around there, I don't know how
 it is no w, let me t e ll 
you they do sound a little 
different, I suppose.  Then 
after we were marr
ied -- but, as I said
, these were just 
acquaintances.  Most, I agree 
wit h y o u that most of my  
friends in the beginning, it 
was language, common 
experiences I'm 
sure had a lot to do 
with it.  All of my 
friends in New York before I 
came to Washingt on were surv
iv or s.  It is n '
t j ust that 
they were Polish, th
ey were survivors. 
 We may have met 
some peopl
e here and 
there.  I remem ber  we m et a v er y lovely
 G e rman lady who was m uc h older t h an we 
were.  She befriended us, and 
t ook our  horr or , I r emember
 lat er.  She was a -- she 
had c om e t o Am er ican short ly bef or e the wa
r .   I remem ber that s h e h a d a s o n in 
Long Island who was a physician, and 
I don't remember wh
ere I got -- we got 
terr ibly ups et when she told us that s he c
ouldn't hav e us meet 
-- she wanted us to 
meet her son, but s
he couldn't have him invite us 
to his house, 
because when he 
cam e t o t h is c o unt ry, he had convert e d, 
and he didn't want to
 admit that he was 
Jewish.  And so he didn't wa
nt  -- she didn't -- now, sh
e didn't.  Sh e remained 
Jewish, but it  wa s -- and I re
member to me this was so 
ups ett ing.   On
 one hand, I 
understood why, because I 
was contemplating doing some
thing like this shortly 
after the war.  I was thinking 
of going back to Po
land, and I was thinki
ng that if  I go 
back to Po land I'm no
t going to admit that I'm Jewish
.  Or I was thinking I would go 
somewhere, because why go
 t hrough t h at again?  
But I couldn't do it.
 
Q: Go through 
what again?
 
A: Go through what I 
went through.  It ne
ver left me, the possib
ility that someplac e 
somebody -- I want to
 tell you something. 
 Whenever something 
happens in Israel, I 
get int o a Holoc aust mode.   
The best place for 
me to be when so
mething is going 
on in Israel is actually  Isr
ael, bec aus e ther e I see that t
he ship is n' t sink ing.  But 
when I'm away, I alwa ys thin k that if so
methin g happens in Is
rael, I always thin k 
that it's another Ho locaust.  
 
Q: And when t her e's a bomb
ing or  som et h ing . . .
 
A: Anything.  So in 
that sense, but then 
when I actually met so
mebody who did it, I 
remember I was so terribly s
hock e d t hat he did t hat.   Bu
t I remember th
at she . . .
 
Q: This is Tape 2, Side 2 wi
t h Bella Tovey.  Can you say 
at the end what you --  I'm 
afr a id t h at we m is sed w
hat  y ou s a id at t h e end.
 
A: W e ll, about t h is man who conv ert e d. 
 Well, he -- I mean
,  one part of me 
understood him becau
se I remember people saying 
maybe he didn't wa nt his 
childr en t o go t hr ough what he went thr o ugh.
  But anot her part of
 me found it v er y  

upsettin g.  Well, it 's like we
ll, he handed Hitler a victory,
 I thought, you know.  There 
weren't going to be any Jews, yo
u know, insofar as -- so it 's a very mixed feeling.  I 
have a question for you.  
Did any of the people who you 
interviewe d ever talk about 
the fact that they though
t about not being Jewish?
 
Q: A lot of people went throu
gh kind of cris is a
bout wh ether or not 
they were goin g 
to be Jewish, obse
rvant, very . . .
 
A: So I didn't thin k so
.  Not on your . . .
 
Q: Es pecially  in the DP camps, you know
.  People m a ybe wer e n't  pr act ic i ng any  
religion at all.  It was very
 difficult for a lot of people.
 
A: Oh, neither was I.  I want to tell you th
at until 1959, well, ac
tually -- yeah, unti l 
1959, I never came near 
a t em p le and I  was not a pr act i ci
ng Jew at all.
  Didn't light  
candles, and I had a real det
our with God.  I mean, I 
got marrie d in 1949.  Henry 
and I want ed a c i v i l c er emony
, and they only reason I ag
reed to get 
married in a 
rabbi's  st udy  is bec a us e of m y  four un
cles, you know.  So 
we had a religious 
ceremony, but that was -- I di
dn't have any dealings with 
-- but that's different, but I 
wasn't denying my Jewishness.  I wa s not religious, I wasn't
 going to be 
observant.  
It was m y detour wit h  God.  I n other wor d
s,  that had t o -- if 
I were a Catholic, I 
would have the same feelin
g.  In other words . . .
 
Q: What is the wo
rd you're using?
 
A: Dean (ph)  Torah.
 
Q: What is that?
 
A: Dean (ph) Torah means 
dean, a misjudgment; Torah, bas
ed on the Torah.  It's a 
court based on the Tor
ah.  In old times when two Je
ws had a -- in Po land, for 
instance, when Jews 
had some of their au
tonomy, if you will, th
en often when there 
was a problem between 
two people, some kind of a -- t
hey would rather
 than go to 
the civil court, they would go 
t o a r abbi and hav e what y
ou c a ll a dean (ph) Tor ah in 
front of the rabbi.  It's basi
cally a court case.   Well, I had
 that kind of a dean (ph), 
Torah with God, but to deny 
m y Jewishness, you see, was 
different.   That I couldn' t  
-- I couldn't do that.  
 
Q: You got married in 1949
, and you stayed in New Yo
rk because your husban d 
was in school?
 
A: Right.
 
Q: What happened then to
 you in the '50s, say, leading 
up to when you went to visit 
your s ist er in 1959?
 
A: O k ay.   '52, Henry got a jo
b in W as h ingt on.  He got out  
of Br ook l yn Co
llege with a 
-- he gr aduat ed, and he had a bachelor' s deg
ree in chemistry.  And he had a very  
interesting experience. 
 He  applied -- actua
lly, three experiences.
  First of all,  he 

was -- it was suggested to 
him that he go on to gr
aduate school.  He graduated 
magna cum laude, Phi Beta Kapp
a, but we couldn't afford 
it  at that point.  And he 
just wanted to go wo
rk, so he applied to
 DuPo nt; they didn't respond.  Then he 
applied to Kais er Pharmaceutic al Compan
y,  and he got an int e
rview, and to a l l 
purposes, go the job.  And t h en j u st as c
ourt e sy, he was tak e n int o
 t he off i ce of the 
Vic e Pres ident.  And t he Vic e
 Pr es ident -- t h is was 1952 
-- t h e Vice Pr es ident s a id 
som et h ing t o him in G erm an and Henr y ans w
ered him in G erman. 
 And he s a id t o  
him, "So you're no
t an Am er ic an, where were y o
u dur ing the war ?"  And Henry  
said, "I was in Germany. " 
 And "Where were you in 
G erm any?"  And Henr y said,  
"Court es y of Hit l er, in a c onc ent r at ion c am p
."  And that was the end of his job, he 
didn't get the j ob at Kaiser.  
 That was '52, chemical co
mpanies did not employ Jews 
very readily.  But he did ge
t a job a m ont h lat er wit h  
Be rikson (ph)  Research 
Laboratory, and
 he was sent by Berikson, who wa
s a Swede educ at ed in Am er ica .  
And he employed Henry and 
gave him a job in Washin
gt on, and Henr y opened an 
office in Washington for him 
where he was going to do so
me r es e arc h and lit er at ur e  
sear ch.   And t h at' s how we 
--  Henry  c am e t o W a shingt on
, and I was very upset.  I 
didn't want to leave New York
, I really didn't want to 
leave New York
.  I had made 
my friends, it was my place. 
 It was very hard for me to
 move.  And, as a mat t er of  
fact,  Henr y was  c omm ut ing be
tween January and May.  He
 would come here ever y 
week and come home
 for weekends, come to New 
York.   And t he c omm ut e was  
diffic ult because we didn't 
have the turnpike.  
It was a real trip
, but he did and he 
finally -- but ,  you know,  we had t o mak e a 
decis i on.  He was n 't 
goin g to go bac k t o  
New York,  he had a job and 
a job that was a good job. 
 I remember when Henry 
came home and 
t old me t h at he' s going t o be 
making $75 a week
, and I said t o  
Henr y in all ear nest, s er ious ly
, I said, "Henry, what are we
 going to do with all this 
money?"  Because it  was a lot 
of money for us, it was.  So
 I came here in  April, and 
the cherry blossoms were ou
t and the city was beautiful,
 I remember. 
 An d Henry's 
boss, Berikson, was he
re, and he literall
y wined and dined me
.  And then so I 
agreed that  I had t o mov e, 
so we mov ed and I was mise
r able in the 
beginning.  
F irst of  all,  Washingt on in
 1952 was a v ery  pr ov inc i
al town , and New Yo rk was 
really an exciting city.  An
d I didn't have any 
friends, and I was ve
ry lonely.  I was 
really lonely, it  wa s really  di
fficult.  So what we would do
 oft en is  s pend a week  he re 
and go to New Yo rk 
for weekends.  So
 we
 were going back and 
forth.  But then I 
met some f riends, I  made my 
first Am er ican frie
nds.  I met two neigh
bors, they were  
both m y age.  T h eir hus b
ands were Henr y's age, so we
 were kind 
of the three 
couples, the six of us.  The fu
nny thin g is that they were 
all from outside; they were 
not W a shingtonians.  One,  
Sh ir ley,  wa s  fr om
 Allentown, Penns ylv ania and t h e 
ot her  was f r om New York.   So t hat m ade 
it that was our kind
 of  bond,  and w e  
became very friendly.  
And we stayed friends 
till this day, as a 
matter of fact.  These 
were my first friends in Wa
shin gton, and in 1954, I thin
k, I had my daughter.  I 
became, you know, I gave birt
h to my daughter.  That wa
s five years after we were 
marr ied,  and t hen abou
t a year and a half later, I had 
Cr aig, we had Craig.  And we 

had the townhouse, a li
t t le townhous e, a s e mi- d etac he
d hom e in Silv
er Spring not 

far fr om  here.  And I  was  doi
ng abs o lut e ly one thing, I  
was saving money to go to 
Israel.  By  that time, of
 course, my sister wa s al
ready married.  Sh e had two 
children, her husband had al
ready been in the War of 
Independence.  An d we were 
in contact all the time, I wa
s forever sending pack
ages.  Times were 
rough in Israel, 
in Palestine.  I me
an in comparison, I wa
s rich.  But I was saving money to go t o 
Israel, and in 19
59 I took my five-yea
r-old daughter an
d three-and-a-half-year-old 
son; in Mar ch of '59, we went
 to Israel.  I took a ship, 
I had t o bec a us e I was t ak i n g  
an awful lot of st uff with me.  As I said, th
ings wer e r ough in I srael.  And I went t o  
Israel, and I spent -- I 
left my poor  hus band f o
r all t h is t i me.  He came for a mont h,  
actually.  I'm sorry, he was 
gone a m o nt h.  He had,  at
 that point, he had started 
working and had left Be
rikson.  He was working for 
the National Co
tton Council, 
and it was  a v er y good job. 
 And he had 
some trips that he 
needed to take t o  
Europe, so he came to 
Israel.  But I was in
 Isr ael fr om M arc h t o Septem ber 19- -- I 
was in  Israel for a ha
lf a year.  I saw my 
girlfriend,  Est h er, of  c o urs e, who was  b y  
that tim e m arr ied an
d had a litt le boy.  And I was 
wit h  my sister,  she had t hr ee 
children at that point an
d I fell in love 
with Israel.  At that  point, I think that 's  when I 
started making peace with G
od a little bit.  I 
walk ed t he str e ets of Es Salt an d 
Jerusalem.  I walk ed 
into the first synagogue that wa
s in Jerusalem, 
and my sister 
who was not religious would 
light Shabbat candles.  She 
wouldn't say a prayer, she 
would say, "Shabbat, Shalom."
  And I thought this was 
a very nice custom for a 
beginning for me, a
nd I started -- I became 
very interested.  I a
lways loved history. 
It's f unny, you s a id y ou liked it  bec a
use I alwa ys like hist
or y,  always loved 
archeology.  If my life
 had normally, when I wa
s child I used to tell my father  that I'm 
going t o be an arc h eologist, 
I didn't do that. 
 But when I came 
back from Israel, I 
had already been enrolled.  I was going to
 night school in Mary
land, and I seriously 
thought of becoming an acco
untant.  I thought it woul
d be a good thing to do, I 
wouldn't have to work may
be full-time, you know, raisi
ng kids.  But I switched, I 
dec i ded t o  study Hebr ew.  
And I started to really, I 
started st udy i ng T or ah.  I  
enrolled at Balt imor e Hebrew 
College.  I took all my cour
ses t h ere in Hebr ew.  I  go t  
my degree in Hebrew 
lett ers, and I became a lic e ns ed
 Hebr ew teacher.  And while I 
was going to school, I star
ted teaching Hebrew
 in different sy
nagogues.  For a 
while I taught at Northwood 
when they had H
ebrew as a language.  And then the 
last 10 years befor e  I reti
red,  I was s
u perv is ing t
he Hebrew Departm e nt a t  
Was h ington Hebr ew Congr e gat
ion, s o t hat  was m y last -- but s t udy i ng Hebr ew ,  
studying Torah, stud
ying the town, I did it  a lot of 
reading.  And I also for the first 
time, I did not be
fore, I didn't talk
 much about the Holo caust 
and I didn't re
ad muc h.  
I started r e ading a lot.
 
Q: When?
 
A: I started -- well, it kind
 of came together.
  I needed to
 understand, 
I needed to 
understand a little bit.
  I couldn't ma
ke peace with
 the Holocaust emot
ionally myself.  
I don't think anyone -- occa
sionally, sometimes, you know
, if  they tell you, you 
know, t hat a ther apist or a ps yc hologist or
 a ps yc hiat r is t  can 
help.  Thes e ar e not  

problems that a psychiatrist 
can -- I mean there 
was nothing that 
I could work out 
with a psychiatrist.  It isn't 
that I needed to un
derstand why 
my mother didn't treat 
me right or I didn't-- there wasn't 
anything like that.  To 
understand the 
Ho locaust, 
you c a n't under st and t he Holo
caust.  In other words, I 
c an't im agine that any b ody  
can be helped by a ps yc hiatr ist  in t erm
s of the experiences 
of  the Holoc aus t .  
Perhaps some people, if
 they have some guilt
 relate it to the Ho
locaust.  I'll be ver y  
honest  with you, I nev er f e lt
 guilty that I surv
ived and some didn'
t.  Because I didn't 
sur v iv e,  I didn't  do an
ything to anybody to su
rvive.  I surviv ed by
 sheer luck.   Some 
Ho lo c au st sur v iv or s h av e t h is 
guilt, even if they surviv ed 
t he s ame way as I did.  I  
don't know why. 
 M ay be t hat  k i nd of 
a thing can be cleared 
up or helped through 
some therapy, just to
 understand that there's no guilt
 in having surv
ived.  On the 
contr ary , if anyt hing,  
perhaps a little 
triumph that Hitler didn't
 accomplish everything, 
that s om ehow we'r e her e.  And,  you k
now,  I marr ied and I hav e  a s on and a 
daughter, so, you know
, why should I feel guilty about 
that?  Bu t to go somewhere 
and try to understand
 and to make peace 
with the Ho locaust on
 an emotional level, 
I don't try and I can't.  When 
I get a bad dream, 
when I have a nightmare, I either 
take a pill or I get up and 
read a book.  Henry does it  
all t he t im e.  When he sees  
his father's face -- he does
n't tell me much, 
but I know t h at he was - -  the las t  
person, he was Au schwitz with 
his father, and he c
an't get rid of that
 face.  He sees 
his father with that -- once 
in a while, he tell
s me t h at he s ees his  fat her  bec aus e 
they were on a train 
together, and he had this thr
ee, four-day, yo
u know, gray 
gr owth.  And his f ather gav e him som et h
ing t h at he had, they cam e out of the 
ghett o of Lódz.  T hat was a horr ible pl
ac e t o begin wit h, and so he didn't hav e  
much.  Maybe he had some 
cigars and maybe he had so
me -- maybe he a silver 
dollar or s o met h ing.  And he 
gav e  it to Henr y  and he s a id
, "Take it.  I don't need it  
anym or e."  Or s om et h ing. 
 And I k now when Henr y ha
s that dream or when he 
sees this, he just gets
 out of bed.  I don't 
ask him.  G o es down 
t o t h e den.  T ak e a 
crime story and he reads.  
You can't solve anything ab
out that.  Bu
t I needed to 
solve for myself, I don't mean solv e.  
I needed to u
nderstand how God could permit 
that.  Now,  Henry doesn't have
 this  problem because I thin
k he's an atheist or he' 
an agnostic.  So he's not 
asking God how God could all
o
w it.  Insofar as he's 
conc er ned,  he has an expr es s i on, he s a ys,
 "Shit falls."  Look 
what's going on all 
over the world.  Ther
e are people killing people in othe
r places.  So maybe in  that 
sense he doesn't have, but 
I have -- I'm not an agnostic. 
 I have some kind of a 
belief, I don't necessarily  be
lieve in a Jewish God.  I 
believe in a Supr em e -- I  
believe in  God.  So  I have to figure out 
for myself, I h
ad to, how this 
could happen. 
And they way I have so
lv ed it, and I think 
I've said that  per
haps in  other places, 
when I read a b
ook by Dr. Fakenheim 
(ph), Pr ofessor Fakenhei
m, I think he was a 
professor at the University 
of -- Canadian.  Th
ere's a Univ ersity in Canada, I'm 
trying to remember.  I d
on't rem e mber the nam e.  Any w ay, he was a pr of es s or o f  
history in Canada.  He now I th
ink is a professor 
in Moretus  in Je
rusalem.  And he 
wr ot e a book, "God's Plac e in Histor y."  I 
don't remember
 exact ly,  you m ay not.  
And he said somethin g 
in the book, and it 's 
absolutely true.  He said that God was 

no t in  Au sc h w itz,  th at
 God gav e us  -- when you speak  
to the Jews, he
 gave us the 
Torah, but that's not im port
ant.  He gave, he ta
ught people wh at is right and wh at is 
wr ong.   And if we choos e t o
 do the wrong thin
g, then we do it.  And God didn ' t  
create Auschwit z, the Ge
rmans did.  And what 
happened in Auschwitz was 
between the Ger m ans  and t heir vict im s.  
And now, perhaps in th
e earlier history, 
according to Fakenheim, did in
terfere.  He took us out 
of Egypt, but th
at was a god 
of a different t im e.  I n  our 
t im e, God does  not int erf er e. 
 So I have that kind of a 
peace with myself that I 
don't blame God for Auschwit
z;  I blam e t h e Germans  for  
Auschwitz.  Just as I blam
e, just as I will pu
t the blame of the 
people who kill eac h 
ot her in Bur undi, Rw
anda, Yugoslavia.  
 
Q: I want t o  as k y ou somet h ing t hat you hav
e not s pok en about, ok ay .  Fir st of all, I  
want ed to as k y ou t h is bec a us e t o s o many 
sur v iv or s it ' s an iss u e.  And t hat is  did 
you t a lk t o your childr e n about y o ur exper i
ence?  And if  you di
d, when did you an d 
why did y o u?  And if y o
u didn't, why didn't you?
 
A: Oh, okay.  Well, you kn
ow, it  would be nice if  my
 daughter could -- because I 
sometimes talk to her a
bout it.  I did ta
lk to my children.  I th
ink at  diff erent t i mes ,  
and it depended -- when the reas
on came.  I didn't live it
 all the time with them. 
Actually, when the kids
 wer e litt le , whe n t he y  we re gr owing up in t h e ho us e, t h es e 
were really happy ti
mes for us in many 
way s .   But I talk ed t o t h em bec aus e when 
they were little, a
nd they wanted to k
now, for instance, wh y 
Lisa Zidner has a 
gr andm ot her who's c o ming t o v i s i t and J
anie has a grandpa an
d gr andm a c o ming, 
and wher e ar e my  par ents and 
where are Henry's pa
rents?  So I told them  that both 
my parents and Daddy's 
par ent s are not aliv e.   Why ar en' t
 they alive?  I said, "Well, 
they died in t he war.
"  "How did they die?"  "Well,
 they didn't die -- they died 
because of the war.  And when
 you will be bigger, I will expl
ain it."  And 
I did, and, 
of course, in 1959 they were 
in Israel with me, 
and we  talk ed a litt
le bit mo
re about 
it.  T he c hildr en wer e 
still little.  When they got bigger
 - -  and I did. 
 For inst ance, on 
Tu B' Shevat, I always lit ca
ndles.  That I did even tho
ugh I didn't go 
to a synagogue 
bec aus e t h is was t h e anniv ers ar
y of t h e destr uct ion of m y 
ghett o.  So I lit  c a ndles ,  
and when t he k i ds wer e big 
enough and they would ask me
 why I'm doing it.  And I 
told them I ' m light ing t he c a ndles  to r e
member my mom and 
my fat her  and m y  
sist er and my br ot her .   And as they wer e
 getting bigger, I w
ould tell them about 
some of the things that h
appened to me.  Depe
nding on their agewhen they got big 
enough.  Henry did much
 less of it.  He  had a lot of 
trouble talking abou
t it.  On the 
ot her hand,  and I did disc us s 
this with my daugh
t er, I as ked her wh
et her she f eels -
- because I  want ed to know.  T hat  was s o
me many years lat er,
 whet her she was - -  
when I read the book my He
len Epstein, did you read it
?  Hele n Epstein wr ote a 
book called, "The Children of
 the Holo caust."  I think 
she wr ote about that second 
generation.  And I wa
s very upset when I 
read the book, beca
us e appar ent ly s he 
wr ote the book, she based it
 upon a study that
 was done.  Or 
maybe she did the 
study, discussing it with a 
psychiatrist or  some psyc
hiatrist in Boston, whose 
children -- whose patients we
r e  childr en of Holoc aust sur v iv or s.  And s h e paints  a 

picture of real neurotic, dist
urbed c h ildr en, and I  was ups e
t.  First of all, the first 
thing I  did at t h at point, I wanted t o 
know from my daughte
r and fr om m y  so n 
whet her somet h ing lik e t h is - -
 aft er all, no m att er how 
object iv e y o u t h ink you ar e, 
you're not objective
, you know.  Did I?  Di
d I fill t h em wit h t hes e k i nd of -- s o me of  
the st or ies that s h e wr it es 
about,  you know, thes e c h ildr e
n really grew up in very 
dysfunctional, difficult 
homes.  So I talked to my kids, 
and both my chil
dren told me, 
and t h is was not r i ght  away, but  thr ough t h
e y e ars; t h is is t he pic t ur e I got f r om  
them.  That theirs wa s a 
happy childhood, that they had a good home.  That they 
were awar e of a lot of t h ings
 and they were
 not totally not affect
ed.  In other words, 
ok ay , in ot her wor ds, what t hey
 --  then, as a matter of fact, let me tell you how they 
saw.   That they were
 not  to be com p ar ed wit h t h e 
c hildren t hat Helen Epst ein is  
talking about fully.  And, in
 fact, it was Robbi (ph) wh
o c am e out, m y daught er,  wit h 
the idea that perhaps we were lucky, Henr
y and I.  We had s ur v
iv e d th e Ho loc au s t  
and we were y oung.   I had lo
st my par e nts ,  lost  my s i ster  and m y brot h er, but I  
didn't lose a husband and I didn
't  lose childr en.  Many of
 the children described in 
Helen's books were rais ed 
as second children.  They 
were raised 
by people who 
had lost not just their 
past, but their future. 
 Some of these people 
lost their children.  
Later I met some -- I know some people were  -- sorry.  
Robbi had a friend who told 
her -- he was a s urv iv or 's s o n 
-- that he didn't know that
 he had a sister until his 
fat her  was on his deat h bed.  
 When his father was dying, 
he told him that before the 
war, he wa s marrie d and he
 had a daughter.  Why thes
e people could not deal with 
it, I don't know.  I belonged 
to the generation, and ther
e were many 
like me, who 
surviv ed the war and did not 
los e  hus b ands and c h ildr en. 
 I was too young for that. 
That m a y hav e m ade a diffe
rence.  I think that fo
r anybody who studies the 
Holo caust surviv ors, I 
think they should draw 
that line.  That wa
s more diffic ult for 
people who had that.  So in 
that sense, I'm no
t taking any credit, 
it  may have been 
easier.  Did my children -- were
 my children affected by some
 of it?  Definitely.  In 
what way?  Well, first of all,
 t he f act t hat Henry did not 
talk was not very good.  It 
would have helped if  he did. 
 On the other hand
, I can't say that  
he never talked. 
He talk ed about be
fore the war how things
 were at home.  He 
just didn't 
talk about 
Auschwit z, he couldn't.  And 
that was probably -- but I did.
  And I think that was --  
Robbi always felt that that was good.  That
 I had, that t hey di
dn't have to im agine 
things being worse th
an t h
ey  were, s o t h at was  helpf
ul.  On the ot
her hand, Robbi 
said that I was neurotic a
bout certain things, and, fo
r instance, I was probably 
ov er pr otect i ve.  I tr ied not to be.  Up her e
, I tried not to be.  
I sent my s on and my  
daughter -- my da
ughter was 10 years ol
d when she we nt for fo
ur weeks 
to camp, 
and m y s o n was nine and a half.   In ot her 
words, I sent them 
to camp away from 
home.  I gave them a lot of 
freedom.  I did not -- but that
 was up here. 
 Emotionally, 
I suppose if  Robbi wa s late 
from school, I may have been 
a little more upset than I 
should have.  Fortunately, even
 though Henry did 
not -- Henry act
ed in this sense 
as good balance.
  When I, when 
we went -- when the kids 
lear ned how to s w im an d 
we'd be going to a swimming
 pool and I would go with 
the kids, and 
they learned 
how to jump from t
he, what is  it?  Fr
om the diving board.  
And so we made a n  

agreem ent,  so I said t o t hem , "O kay, wh
en I'm not  her e, y o u 
can't jump off the 
diving board.  You ca
n swim."  And so the kids said
, "W hy?  Why can't  we?  W e'r e 
good swimmers. "  By the wa
y, I ' m not a swimmer.  I ca
n f l oat.   So when we c am e 
home, but I said, "No, I won'
t allow you when I'm not here.
"  So t h e k i ds as us ually  
they would take their case 
to their father.  So they 
would say to He
nry, "Daddy, 
Mom won't let us jump
 off the diving board when she's not there."  So Henry looked 
at me and he said, "Bel
la,  t ell m e  what is t he diff er enc e ?"
  First of  all,
 he thought it 
was funny.  He said, "What co
uld you do for them if you 
were there watching?"  So 
that was already -- but anyway, I 
said, "Well, I'll feel better 
if I'm there.  I'll holler for 
help."  Well, anyway, this wa
s said to me.  Henry said 
to me, "You can either be 
there all the t ime, but you c a nn
ot restrict them."  So that
 was settled, and this was 
how we s et t led s om e of t hes es.  So y e ah,
 I had some, I wouldn'
t let Craig ride a 
bik e t o the library until Henr y 
said that this is crazy, and 
then Cr aig rode
 the bike to 
the libr ar y.  But 
we settled this.
 
Q: You negotiated together?
 
A:  Yeah, we did, we did.  
Yeah, we did.  O n t he ot he
r hand, when Cr aig went to 
Harvard, he didn't tell me.  
This is how I found out ab
out the book. 
 He took a 
cour se on t he Holoc aust.  He has  a libr ary 
on the Ho locaust.  That's not his field,  
but, you know, this his interest
.  There's no questi
on.  So wer e the kids aff ect ed?  I  
think so, definitely
.  But perhaps not in 
a totally damaging way, I don't think so.  I 
hope not.  My daughter had 
s om e pr oblem s , but 
I don't think they 
had anything to 
do with the Holocaust.  In fa
ct, s he us ed t o s a y to m e that when s h e had -- s h e had 
a c h em ic al dis or der.  She had a pr em enstr u
al,  what is it ?  Pr em enstr ual sy ndr o me,  
PM S, t h at led  pr a ct ic a lly  to  
depression until they
 f i nally medic at ed her.  It was  jus t  
totall y uncalled for, because it 
wasn't recognized.  Bu t she sa
id to me that
 it got to a 
point that when she was in
 Pr incet o n and she s t art ed 
hav i ng pr oblem s.  And s h e 
would go for help, and
 s h e said,  "M om, I got t o a po
int where I wouldn't tell them 
that I'm a Holocaust su
rv iv or 's child, because they woul
d get int o it, "  and she s a id,  
"and my pr oblem had nothing 
to do with the Holocaust."
 
Q: So she was aware of . . .
 
A: Yeah.   But as I s a y, s h e'
s f i ne.  And s h e' s on
 medication, but if
 it hadn't been 
neglected.  She had some rough years becaus
e of that.  But it  
was, she said on the 
other hand, she probably is a li
ttle  bit more high-strung th
an she wo uld have been if 
she hadn't been raised
 in a house by a 
mother who, when t
he phone ring, I would 
jump.  So . . .
 
Q: And now that your children
 are adults and out of the 
house and it 's
 just you and 
your husband, does 
he talk  more?  Do  you talk  more to other people about what 
you went through?  Is it ev
en a diff er ent phas e of y o ur 
lif e now in your own thinking 
about the Holo caust?
 

A: Well,  this has been a pr oc e
ss.   As I  t o ld you, or iginal
ly, I did not talk about th e 
Holocaust at all.  I star
ted talking about it.  That
 wa s right away a . . .
 
Q: We need to sw
it ch tapes here.
 
End of Tape 2.
 

Tape 3
 
Q: This is Tape 3 of an interview with Bella Tovey on June 6th, 1996 -- June 
10th, 1996.  The question that I started to
 ask at the end of Tape 2 was, your 
children have left home now, and you and 
your husband are here together, and 
how is your thinking about the Holocaust today, compared to when you had 

children at home, or when they were young?
  Where are you now in your thinking 
about it?
 
A: Well, mostly, as I said, 
I didn't -- we don't, Henry and I 
-- it's funny.  We don't 
talk about the Holoc aust.  I can talk to 
Henry about it, although I 
will say this:  In 
19- -- there are a couple of things that
 happened.  First of a
ll, I talk about the 
Holoc aust more mostly because -- and I started originally when I was a Hebrew 

teacher talking to my class.  First I talk
ed to my children at home.  Then I talked -
- but mostly that's why I agreed to interv
iews, I gave my oral history.  When I 
started reading that people were denyi
ng that the Holocaust happened, I think I 
took, I made a definite decision that I need 
to make some kind of a contribution if 
I can, because I realize t
hat there are people who are d
enying that the Holocaust 
happened.  And particularly I remember r
eading about a Professor Butz, B-u-t-z, 
I think.  He was at the University of
 Northwestern, and he wrote a book called 
"The Hoax of the Twentieth Century," denying.
  In other words,this is not just, 
you know, some of these skinheads denying 
the Holoc aust.  But this is scholarly 
work being written that the Ho
locaust never took place. 
 It's that kind of a thing 
that made me want to do it. 
 That, plus the fact that we did take Roberta and 
Craig to Poland in 1989, shor
tly after Henry retired.  We
 went back to my city, to 
Henry's city, went to Auschwi
tz.  We went to all of these places.  We went to 
Mogilev.  Our son and our daughter wanted,
 they felt it was an incredible 
experience.  My husband paid for it 
by becoming -- and he's never been 
depressed.   He was depressed for three m
onths after we came home.  It was a 
rough trip for him.  He did it for his ki
ds, and it was at that time that he talked 
about his experiences because it was 
-- I mean we were  in Auschwitz. 
 
Q: To the kids?
 
A: Yeah, to the kids.  Most of the time
 Henry and I do not talk about it.  When I'm 
called up occasionally  by the Children's Mus
eum, I go and talk, because I feel it's 
important.  I gave a talk at 
my temple a couple of years ago.  Henry actually gave 

a talk once in his life last year at t
he Liberation.  We had a wonder ful service 
dedicated to the liberators last year, 
and Henry was one of the people who the 
rabbi -- Henry's very fond of our rabbi, 
so he twisted his arm, and Henry gave a 
short talk.  That was the only time that 
Henry talked.  I will also say to you, 
though, that when some of my friends w
ho are survivors -- I don't have too many 
friends here.  I have one couple, but we
 have some friends who oc casionally 
come from New York.  When we get toget
her, usually, and this is kind of a joke 
and a password.  That one of our friends wil
l say, "Well, we came to Auschwitz.  

Why don't we go home?  Why don't we go to 
sleep?"  In other words, if I can 
explain what happens , yeah.  
I think that when we are 
together, particularly with 
people who went through what we did, we find ourselves  somehow drifting back.  
And usua lly somebody then will say, "Okay,
 we're already in Aus chwitz.  Why 
don't we call it quits?  And why don't we go to sleep?"  
 
Q: I don't understand that.
 
A: What happens is that we are together. 
 We can be talking about our kids, we 
can be talking about politics.  Henr
y and I volunteered this days in the 
Whitehous e, and we are very, very pro-Clint
on, for instance, so we talk abo ut 
politics.  We can talk about music.  My
 husband loves bir ds.  We can be talking, 
and then suddenly somebody will say some
thing, remember something that 
happened.  And then we'll star
t talking about -- and one thi
ng leads  into the other, 
he'll mention something, t
hen we start talking about 
the Holoc aust.  And then 
somebody will usually say, "Well, we 
are in Auschwitz.  Why don't we go to 
sleep?"  Meaning, that somehow Auschwitz is
 the, what is it, is the synonymous 
thing with Holoc aust.  So we got to Auschwit z, why don't we call it quits?  Why 
don't we stop talking?
 
Q: Meaning, let's not talk about this anymore?
 
A: Meaning that somehow it's -- no 
matter what we talk about, when we are 
together with people who went through what
 we went through, we somehow end 
up getting to Auschwit z.  So yeah, can I say that we do?  Yeah, we do.  

Somehow it didn't leave us.  I remember 
you have on that big film, the big one in 
the Holocaust Museum, somebody said that
 she tries not to teach her childre n to 
hate.  I never taught my kids 
to hate.  And if they want to forgive, my son is flying 
to Israel today.  I hope he has a good trip, and he's so happens that his trip is 

paid for by his Univ ersity.  And the 
tickets, he's going via Frankfort with 
Lufthansa.  And from there I think he's ta
king via -- to Israel, 
but he's stopping in 
Frankfort for a day.  I will not go to Germ
any.  My son is going, he isn't going to 
visit Germany, but he is going to go thr
ough Frankfort and go on.  It's okay.
 
Q: Because you still have . . .
 
A: It's okay for him, and it's fine, but 
I will not go to Germany.  I will not forget and 
I'm not forgiving.  Not where the Germ
ans are concerned.  So am I left with 
something?  Yeah, probably.
 
Q: Do you have grandchildren yet ?
 
A: My son has three adopted children.
 
Q: Are they old enough to ask questions?
 

A: Probably, but we haven't gotten to ta
lk about it.  His oldest daughter is 10 and 
a half.  Two are from Korea; one is from 
Peru.  And Kendall is going with Craig to 
Israel, so I don't know.  
I'm sure that Craig has talked to her about it.
 
Q: It would be interesting maybe as they
 get older to see how you think about 
talking to them.
 
A: I don't know.  Come to think of it, we
 have talked a little bit because they come 
home for Passover, and it is during Passov er t
hat we talk a little bit about it.  As a 
matter of fact, last year I was 50 y
ears when we were lib erated, and Robbi and 
Craig, our son and our daughter, and my s
on-in-law -- my son is divorced -- 
planted 50 trees, 100 trees, excus e me for 
us in Israel; 50 for me and 50 for 
Henry in honor of our liberation.  So
 we talked about be
ing liberated and our 
children and grandchildren were here, so we
 do talk a little bit about it already.  
 
Q: How did your relationship with your sister turn out?
 
A: Great.  I have a wonderful relationship wi
th my sister.  My sister did what she 
needed to do, and as I said, once I came to 
America, I did not take a walk to 
Israel.  I did not go to Israel
, I settled here.  I've pretty lucky in this country.  It's 
been a great country for us.  I have some
 moments where I feel that perhaps I 
should hav e gone to Israel.  Because I think that maybe all Jewis h people s hould 
be in Israel, but it's nice coming to Amer
ica.  I have my -- as I say, I have my 
mixed feelings occasionally.  But this is 
by now my country, so in that sense I 
think I'm like many of the first, what 
is it, immigrant Am
ericans.  I'm probably 
more patriotic than even my children.  I 
find that Americans don't appreciate this 
country as much as people who have come
 here.  And I mean 
that honestly, with 
all its faults, this is a truly great count
ry.  A very democratic country.  There's 
some problems, problems everywhere.  Wasn't
 it Churchill that said it's the worst 
of the best systems?  Oh, no.  He said 
something.  It's a bad system, but it's the 
best of all the bad ones.  
 
Q: It's come to my 
conscience here about a year or so, especially last winter 
during the presidential primar
ies, you probably are -- my
 assumption is that you 
are sensitive to hearing anti-Semitism expr essed by polit ical figures or aspiring 

politic al figures.  How does your experience play itself out in your politic al view of 
your life here?  Or maybe it doesn't.
 
A: Well, I am sensitive to it, and for inst
ance, definitely when I make my decisions 
about voting, I am very careful to -- I definitely am sensitive to anti-Semitic or 
even, you know, that kind of an expre
ssion.  Henry worked with non-Jews most 
of his life, and some of them were
 truly wonderful people who had no -- they 
were not prejudiced.  But he had friends 
who would occ asionally s ay I Jewed him 
down or something.  And when it comes 
to political people, I could not stand 
Baker.  I thought that the Bush administ
ration was -- and it's not because they 
were Republicans.  Reagan had his faults, G
od knows.  I didn't 
care for some of 

his politics, but he was not an anti-Semitic.
  Bush was an anti-Semitic, he was a 
kind of an aristocratic anti-Se
mitic, if you will.  And Baker, even worse.  Clinton is 
-- maybe that's why -- that's
 not the only reason I'm fond 
of him, but Clinton with 
all of his faults -- they accuse him of 
so many terrible thi
ngs, but I think he's 
basically a totally unprejudiced man.  And to
 me -- to me, this
 is more important 
than anything else.  I don't worry about rela
tionships between, I'
m not God.  I'm 
not telling p eople ho w to live.  I don't ca
re whether Clinto n has a mistress or will 
have a mistress, that's not my business. 
 I think that the mo
st important thing 
about a human being is to be fully accept
ing of other human beings.  And I 
treasure people who are able to see hum
an beings as human beings regardless 
of the color and religion and whatever.  And 
Clinton, to me, with all of his faults, 
and God knows he's got lots of faults
; everybody does.  Clinton is a truly 
unprejudic ed man.  I someti
mes wonder whether hopefully maybe this is true for 
this younger generation.  My daughter, fo
r instance, I have some non-Jewis h 
friends, but not that many.  We had more
 when Henry was working.  Robbi, even 
though she belongs to a temple and she's 
Jewish in the sense that she's more 
observant that I am, 50 percent of her 
friends are not Jewish.  And maybe your 
generation is less prejudiced, maybe y
ou have -- although God knows that's 
probably not true.  I work in the Whitehous e,
 and I hear all kinds of things when I 
answer the phones.  But to me, this is 
the most important thing about a person.
 
Q: Is this something that you learned fr
om your parents or something that you 
learned as a result 
of your experience?
 
A: What?  Not appreciating a human being 
who can be without a prejudice?  I'm 
trying to think.  My father was a very to
lerant man.  My fa
ther was a religio us 
Jew.  My father was a ve
ry tolerant person.  When 
people would come and say 
that they saw a friend's son smoking 
on Shabbat, and my father did not smoke 
on Shabbat.  He would say, "What's the ma
tter?  Only the non-obs ervant have a 
right to smoke on Shabbat?"  So I probably grew up in a very tolerant home.  

That may have been, but I think that the 
war had a lot to do with it, too.  There's 
no question.  I mean our mind is a reac
tion.  When I meet people who surviv ed 
the Holocaust, and there are some of us, 
who will say -- although I think if they 
start thinking, they wouldn't -- who will sa
y something derogatory about blacks or 
something.  I get terribly upset, I think that
 we have absolutely -- if we didn't take 
anything out of those camps, we have 
to remember that we are all human 
beings.  And we have to remember something 
else, that it's so important, it's so 
important not to allow yourself a kind of
 a -- if people think that just saying 
something negative about another person 
is not dangerous, they're wrong.  I 
think that the minute you open up the po
ssibility that somebody is  not quite 

worthy of the same treatment as you are 
-- I'm always that when I talk to children 
and, you know, when I talk to any groups
, that when somebody 
will try to take 
away one right, when somebody will try to te
ll you that you are not entitled to one 
thing of all the thousands things that
 other people are en titled, that's the 

beginning of the end.  I think we all have to be 
so sensitive to it.  To me, this is so 
important that every human being has to 
have the same rights.  And we have  no 
right, I have no -- if I sometimes, think, 
you know, if I get angry at something or, 
you know, when I hear these stories about we
lfare, it doesn't matter that there 
are more blacks who are on welfare.  It 
doesn't matter.  Use t
he words that there 
are more people in New York who are 
on welfare, but don't 
put the labels of 
black, whit e, green, yellow.
  I'm very proud of the fa
ct that my son adopted two 
children from Korea and one child from Pe
ru.  It means that he grew up in a 
home where he didn't hear that being Je
wis h is better than anything else.  
 
Q: And yet, you told me an hour ago thatwhen you, in 1945, you couldn't stand 
the sight of German children, so you've m
ade a lot of -- you've sort of come a 
long way in your thinking.  That's different?
 
A: No, no.  That's differen
t.  Let me explain.  When I 
said in 1945 that I had to get 
out of Germany, I emotionally was very 
troubled.  I adored my kid sister, and I 
lost a kid sister and a kid brother.  My
 brother was born in 1933, and he was 10 
years old when he was  taken to Auschwitz.  I wasn't home anymore, and my 

sister was 12 years old.  I 
lost two children, my younger siblings, and when I saw 
families -- and I lost my parents.  And 
when I would occasiona lly  get out of 
Bergen and I saw people, normal people -- a fa
ther and a mother
 and a couple of 
children -- walk ing on the street, and they t
ook that away from me.  And they did 

it, so yeah, I hated them.  And frankly, I 
was afraid -- I didn't want to stay in 
Germany; I didn't want to hate that mu
ch, and I didn't know where that hatred 
would bring  me to.  I don'
t think that I would h ave gone o ut and kille d somebod y, 
but I'll tell you this:  When I heard, because I wasn't involved, when I heard that 

the inmates in Bergen-Belsen put  a c
ouple of barracks on fire where the SS men 
were put in.  When the British came in, 
they took some of 
the SS men who didn't 
manage to escape and put them in a 
barrack and they surrounded them.  And 
then some of the prisoners who can walk, so
me of us had -- not all of us were in 

my shape.  They put those barracks on fire
, and the British soldiers walked away.  
Of course, they later, the prisoner s were 
not allowed near t
hose.  These became 
suddenly prisoners of war.  
But I was delight ed to hear i
t.  I think they should 
have killed more Germans.  Are you aski
ng me now whether I still -- now, I don't 
hate the Germans who were born after the 
war and have nothing to do with it.  I 
mean, obviously, emotionally -- even emot
ionally, I don't hate them.  But I have 
not forgiven the Germans who were involved 
in it.  And, by the way, I didn't read 
the book by Goldhagen, and I don't know 
how factual.  I don't know, but I'll tell 
you this:  He is absolut ely right when he says that many, many, many more 
Germans knew about what was happen
ing, benefited from it, and were 
participators to the Holocaust.  There is 
no -- I don't, I have 
no doubt about it.  I 
am not a historian, but I saw enough.  The German soldiers didn't have to kill us.  
The Germans -- my God, it happened in my
 own house.  A month after the war 
broke out, a German bitch came in with tw
o SS men or soldiers, and they took 

everything out of our house.  And what 
do you think these people did with all the 
things that they took fr
om German homes?  They sent it back to Germany.  How 
did the Germans suddenly get all these things
?  Insofar as I'm concerned, to me, 
the German nation was collectively guilty.  T
hey followed Hitler, they did it.  But I 
don't hate the Germans because they have blonde hair or blue eyes or black 

hair.  I hate the Germans for what they di
d, that's different.  I don't like Farakan, 
not because he's blac k.  I hate Farakan for 
what he's preaching, that's different.  
When I'm talking about tolerance, I'm 
talking about treating people as human 
beings.  Bu t I will tell y ou this:  I'm not a Ch
ristian, I'm not turning my other cheek, 
and I'm not forgiving those who 
hurt me.  In that sense,
 maybe I'm Jewish, yeah.  
I'm not forgiving the Germans.  Let the pope do 
it; I won't.  And if 
there is a God, I 
hope there is a God, I also 
hope there's hell.  And in t
hat hell, I hope Hitler is still 
burning.  Do I sound mean?  Fi
ne, that's how I feel.  
 
Q: When you talk to children in various 
plac es, what do they want to know?  
What do they -- I'm sure it depends on how old they are.
 
A: Well, it depends, it depends.  And they a
sk some questions.  I will say this:  I'm 
more careful, I wouldn't say what I just
 told you about Hitler burning in hell to 
children.  You know, you have to be a littl
e more -- although I tell the children that 
I have not forgiven the German people who 
did it, those who did it.  And I may 
also say that if God wants to forgive t
hem, that's his business but I'm not.  You 
know, that's -- children ask very intere
sting questions, very often what they will 
do, and this is so touching.  They'll come over and they'll say to me, they'll say to 

me, "Do you have children?"  And I'll say, "Y
es."  And they'll say, "That's good, so 
you have somebody you can love now."  Which is really very touching.
 
Q: Is there anything else?
 
A: No.  I don't think so.  I think I talked more than enoug h.
 
Q: Okay.  This is the end of this is the th
ird tape.  This is the end of the interview 
with Bella Tovey on June 10th, 1996 at her 
home in Silver Spring, Maryland.  
And I'm Nina Ellis for the Holocaust Museum.
 
Conclusion of interview.
