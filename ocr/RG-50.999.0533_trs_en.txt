webs ite, www.us hmm .org, to s ee the s c hedule of forthc oming progr ams  and gues ts.
 
 
Ins ide the pr ogr am  booklet
 
that you rec eived is  a c ar d that s ays  Stay Connec ted.  If you fill out 
that card and give it to a repr es entative at the back of the theater at the end of the progr am today, you 
will rec eive a c opy of Dr.
 
Munzer's  biography which you c an r evisit and s har e 
with friends .  It's  als o a 
way to know if we have pr ogr am s . We do tour events  around the c ountry and may be in your  
c om m unity at s ome point in the future.
 
 
To give you a s ens e of what to expect, Al will s har e his  story today with us  for approximately 
45 m inutes  after  whic h we will have time to tak e your  questions .  If we r un out of time during the 
question and ans wer period, I know he is  a ver y friendly per s on and will be happy to s tay ar ound for a 

few minutes  after wards  to talk with you.
 
 
What you are about to hear from  Al is one individual's  exper ienc e during the period of the 
Holoc aus t.  We have prepared a brief s lide pr es entation to orient you for the c onver s ation. 
 
 
We begin with this portr ait of Alfred Munzer dres s ed in a J ewis h National Fund c os tum e 
for  
the Pur im Holiday when it's tr aditional for c hildr en to wear  c ostumes .  He is  dres s ed as the objec t that 

he is  holding in his  hand.  He is a walking, talking, J ewis h National Fund in a c ostum e made by his  
m other .  
 
 
This  is a por trait of Al's  par ents on their  wedding day in the city of Hague in the Nether lands, a 
Dutc h c ity.  His  parents, Simc ha and Gis elle, were mar ried in 1932.

Al had two older s ister s.  He is  the c ute baby there in the middle.  His  older  s is ter Eva is  
pic tur ed on the left and
 
Leah 
is  on the right with Al between them.
 
 
For  his tor ic al c ontext, Nazi Germ any invaded s everal c ountries  inWester n Eur ope in the 
s pr ing of 1940 and in partic ular invaded the Netherlands , as  we can s ee in the red c irc le at the top, in 
May
 
1940.  With the Germ
an occ upation, life becam e ver y diffic ult for  Dutc h J ews .  After the invas ion 
the Munzers  initially r emained in their home.  We will hear  fr om  Al later about the trajectory and 
c hanges in their s ituation as  m ore r es tric tions  were plac ed on J ews  in the c oun
tr y.
 
 
In 1942, Al's s is ters went into hiding, s heltered by a fr iend of a neighbor .  Al, who was  a ver y 
s m all baby, really, a toddler , at the time
,  
went into hiding with th
e ex
-
hus band of the neighbor , 
Tole 
Madna, 
an Indones ian man whom we s ee here.  Indones ia had been a Dutc h c olony of the 
Nether lands .  That's  a c onnec tion. 
 
 
Al s pent the r est of the war  in Tole Madna's  home in hiding wher e he was  c ar ed for by the 
woman we s ee on the left, Tole's  Indones ian nanny, a wonderful wom an named Mima Saina.  This  

photo s hows  Al, the boy being held on the r ight by Tole Madna.  You will hear  m or e about thes e 
extraor dinar y people in the c our s e of our  c onversations . 
 
 
With that back ground, pleas e join me in welc oming Dr .
 
Alfred
 
Munzer.
 
 
[Applaus e]
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  Thank  you.  Thank you s o muc h for joining us today.
 
> > Al Munzer :  Delighted to be here.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  Let's begin at the beginning
 Œ a
c tually
,  
before your beginning.  If you c ould tell us  
about your  par ents , wher e they wer e born, what they were like.
 
> > Al Munzer :  Sur e. Well, m y par ents  were born in Eas ter n Europe in a par t of the world whic h was  
par t of the Aus tr o
-
Hungar ian Empire prior to the Firs tWorldWar but whic h after the First World War 
bec am e part of Poland.
  
My m other was  born in a s m all town called Rymanow, and my father was  born 
in Kanc zuga.  Thes e towns wer e not ver y favorable s o m any J ews  left thos e towns , young people 

es pec ially, to seek their for tunes els ewhere.  So that's what happened to my
 
par ents .  My father left 
Kanc zuga dir ectly for  Holland and m y m other left for  Berlin.
 
 
One of the inter esting things, though, about thes e little towns  is  we s or t of have alm os t a 
c ar ic ature im age that c om es  per haps from watc hing "Fiddler  on the 
R
oof" a li
ttle too often of these little 
towns .  But one of the things that r eally has  s tr uck  m e is  that one of the people who c am e from  my 

m other 's hometown was  a man by the nam e of Is idor Rabi who went on to c om e to the United States  
and was  awar ded the Nobel pr ize in physics in 1946 for the discover y of electrom agnetism.  So there 
you have it, a major dis cover y by a m an born in one of thos e little hick  towns , one of thos e 
shtetls
, as  
they wer e c alled in Eas tern Eur ope.
 
 
My m other, as I s aid, s he dec ided to leave t own just like Is idor Rabi had pr evious ly and joined 
her  siblings in Ber lin while my father went directly to Holland.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  How long did your  m other remain in Berlin?
 
> > Al Munzer :  She arr ived in Ber lin in the 1920s.  Inter es tingly, probably jus t at about the s am e time 

that Adolph Hitler's infamous  book "Mein Kam pf," "My s tr uggle" was  being publis hed.  My m other told 
m e s he was n't terribly interes ted in politic s , didn't know anything about the book  at the time and r eally 
was  muc h more interested in playing with her two little nephews , Norbert and Yas i.  That was her  m ajor 
interes t while s he was  ther e.  She r emained in Ger m any until 1932, Dec em ber
 
1932, when s he joined 
her  childhood s weetheart, m y father, in Holland wher e they wer e m arr ied.
 
>> E
dna Friedberg:  In that beautiful photo that we s aw ear lier .
 
> > Al Munzer :  A beautiful photogr aph, whic h ac tually, the date, Dec ember
 
1932, is  another  very 
important date, of c ours e, in the histor y of the Nazi er a.  Bec aus e it was  just about that tim e that Adolph 

Hitler  made his  bid to becom e c hanc ellor  of Germany, really s tar ting off the Nazi er a.  So a ver y happy 
oc c as ion happening in Holland, the wedding of my par ents , and then things  really beginning to go bad 
in Germany.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  How did your  parents  make a living in the 1930s ? 
 

3 
 
> > Al Munzer : Well, my parents' families  fr om  way bac k  wher e tailor s .  My  father had a m en's c lothing 
bus ines s  that he started in Holland, ver y s uc c es sful bus ines s , actually.  In fac t, it's inter esting.  I was  
bac k  
in Holland jus t a few years  ago and the s ign of his  store is  still ther e.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  Really? 
 

> > Al Munzer :  It has a white lie in it
. I
t says 
ﬁ
Siegfried Munzer, 
T
ailor from Vienna.
ﬂ
  
It's r eally a 
beautiful s ign.  That was  his  bus ines s .  He was  ver y s uc c es sful.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  And when did their family expand? 
 
> > Al Munzer : Well, my parents c elebrated the bir th of their firs t c hild, my s is ter Eva, in J uly
 
1936, jus t 
about the s
ame tim e that the infam ous  Ber lin Olympic s  wer e held, whic h Adolph Hitler, of c our s e, tr ied 
to tur n into an instrument of Nazi pr opaganda.  That was  J uly
 
1936.
 
 
Two years  later, a little bit
 
--
 
two and a half year s later in Novem ber
 
1938, my mother gave 
bi
r th to her  s ec ond c hild, m y s is ter Lea
h
.  Another very, very s pec ial, memor able, s adly m emor able, 
day in the his tory of the naus ea er a bec aus e this was  
--
 
of the Nazi er a because this was  r ight after  
Kr is tallnac ht, the Night of Broken Glas s, when hundreds  of s ynagogues  wer e burnt to the ground and 

thousands  of J ewis h bus ines s es  wer e plunder ed in Ger m any and really the s tar t of
 
the full fury of 
anti
-
S em itism .
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  I think  it's  always  very s triking, es pec ially hear ing your  fam ily s tory to think
 
about 
when we look at his torical c
hr ono
logy, we think  of this  s ort of inevitable plod.  But your  family was  
having normal m iles tones  and building and c ould not know what would happen.
 
> > Al Munzer :  Although they wer e c er tainly aware what was  happening to
 
their fam ilies .  When my 
s is ter Eva was  bor n, it was  r eally impos s ible for  any of their r elatives , for exam ple, to join them  for the 

c elebr ation of the birth.  So they were very muc h aware what was  happening to their fam ilies  but they 
tr ied to go on with 
their  lives .
 
 
J ews  had lived in Holland for hundreds  of year s, wer e totally integrated into Dutc h s oc iety.  
And m y par ents  had m ade m any, many friends  in The Hague.  Mos t of them not J ewis h, s ome of them  

J ewis h.  They r eally bec am e part of the c omm unity an
d felt very, ver y s afe. 
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  Did you have a large, extended family els ewher e?
 

> > Al Munzer :  Both m y par ents c ame fr om large fam ilies .  I have never  been able to figure out exac tly 

how m any s iblings .  My father had about s ix or eight s iblings.  My mother c los e to an equal num ber .  
The only one who s ur viv ed that I know of was  one of m y mother 's brothers , Abr aham or Adolph Munzer 
who jus t at the time of Kris tallnac ht, just about that tim e, m anaged to leave Germ any.  He had been 
living in B erli
n.  He was  one of thos e s iblings of my mother who had been living ther e and had hos ted 
her  earlier.  He m anaged to leave one of the very few c ountr ies  in the world that was  s till willing to take 

in J ewis h r efugees .  And that was  Bolivia.  
 
 
So to this  day I still have relatives  liv ing in Bolivia.  In fact, I'm going to go to a 
wedding
 
--
 
ac tually in Chile.  All the relatives  moved from Bolivia to Chile.  I'm  going to a wedding in 
Santiago this  c om ing November .
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  But otherwis e all the aunts, unc les , nephews  you m entioned
 
--
 
> > Al Munzer :  All the others  wer e killed.  One of my father 's  brothers managed to c r oss  the bor der 

fr om  Germany into Holland als o around the tim e of Kr istallnac ht.  It was  Em il
 
Munzer.  He bec ame par t 
of our fam ily.  Many happy photogr aphs of the fam ily c oming together, going to the park , tr ying to go on 

with normal lives .
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  So, ever ything s tar ts to c hange in Europe, obvious ly, at the end of the dec ade.  On 

September
 
1, 1939, Germany begins World War II 
by invading neighboring Poland to its east.  As  I 
m entioned in the intr oduc tion, the following s pring Holland, as  well as  Belgium and Luxem bourg 
so-
c alled low c ountr ies , were attacked.  Fr om talking to your m other and other s, bec aus e you were not 
yet in this  pictur e, tell us  what you can about what this  meant for your  family and for other J ews  living in 

the newly oc c upied c ountr ies .
 
> > Al Munzer : Well, my mother  told m e that the date, May
 
10, 1940, of c ours e, was  a very major  
turning point.  My par ents  had
 
been asked to host a m em ber of the Dutc h
 r
es is tanc e m ovement the 
evening prior to May
 
10.  He s uppos edly c arr ied plans  in this  his br iefcas e to pr eemptively des troy the 

4 
 
big railroad c enter, cros sing c enter, in the c ity.  It was  felt that by destroying tha
t r ailr oad c enter, it might 
s low down the invas ion fr om Germ any.
  
That m orning, May
 
10, 1940, m y parents and their gues ts 
lis tened to the r adio and hear d about the c ity of Rotterdam had been bombed and destr oyed.  Then the 
lar gest por t c ity in Europe and s
till the larges t port c ity.
  
 
 
A few m inutes after that, QueenWilhelm ina of the Netherlands c am e on the r adio and 
announc ed bas ic ally that Holland had s urr ender ed.  She asked people to do their duty, wherever they 

happened to find them s elves .
  
My m other t
old me that the fir st pers on to speak  up after, when the 
queen's  addres s, was  their  gues t.  He s aid in Dutc h, "God zij dank  is  voorbij," "Thank  God it's over."  As 

far as  he was  c onc er ned, he had done his  duty.  He had been part of the res is tanc e movem ent.
  
He 
had done what he c ould to pr event an invas ion from Germ any and now he would jus t have to 

ac c ommodate to living in a c ountry that was  oc c upied. 
 
 
But 
m y parents, of c our se, knew what had happened to their r elatives  in Germ any, relatives  in 
Poland.  So they s uddenly felt ver y m uc h alone with their  two s mall c hildr en, my two s is ters.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  And als o bas ed on the experienc e of their r elatives , they knew that they would not 
s har e with their fellow neighbor s
™ 
treatm ent, that treatm ent would be d
ifferent for J ews .
 
> > Al Munzer :  Yes.  They knew their treatm ent was  going to be different.  And, indeed, within a very 

s hor t tim e, all of the r egulations  that limited the activities  of J ews  that had been put in plac e in Germany 
were put in plac e in Holland within a ver y, very s hort period of tim e.  So Jews  had to r egis ter as J ews .  

There was  a c ens us  that was  taken.  Jewis h men had to take a new middle name jus t like in Germany, 
the nam e Is rael
; 
J ewis h wom en the name Sar ah.  
 
 
And I found s ome doc uments  actually.  It was  m y father's, s uddenly appear ing this middle 
nam e out of nowher e, Israel.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  And thes e names  were to be able to track  J ews .
 
> > Al Munzer :  J us t to be able to tr ack  J ews .  One of the fir st things  that happened, of c ours e, was  the 

banning of the r itual s laughter of animals  for kos her m eat.  And people felt that was  fairly benign of a 
s ever e m eas ur e but that's  how things progr es s ed.  It s tarted with s omething fair ly s imple then to 
s om ething m uc h m or e sever e.
 
 
Now, my m other told me that one of the regulations  that was  put in plac e was  the ban of J ews  
going into
 
--
 
us ing public  tr ans por tation or going into public  parks .  My mother  defied s om e of thos e 
r egulations , thought they were s illy.  So s he did take the baby c arriage with m
y sister
 
Leah 
into a park 
in our  immediate neighbor hood.  A Germ an wom an approac hed the baby c arr iage.  And my mother  

r eally got
 
--
 
s uddenly got s c ar ed.  Her heart s topped almost, she told m e.  And then the wom an looked 
at my s is ter in the baby car r iage and s he s aw blue eyes  and blond c ur ls .  She tur ned to my mother and 
s he s aid, "Oh, you c an tell that that is  good Ar yan, Ger man blood."  My m other thanked the woman 
and, of c ours e, never went back  to that park .  J ust one les s on, you know, of r eally what c ond
itions  wer e 
like for J ews  ver y s oon after  the invas ion.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  The following Marc h, Marc h 1941, all J ewis h property in Holland was  Ar yanized.  

Can you explain what that means  and what it m eant for your family's  
livelihood
? 

> > Al Munzer :  Really it m eant that pr operty that J ews  owned had to be r egis ter ed and now no longer 
was  their private pr operty but was  the pr operty of the Germ an state, bas ic ally; another  major  s tep really 
towar ds  im pover is hing the J ewis h c om munity, is olating them, m aking it m uc h m ore diffic ult for J ews  to 
m ake a living.
  
Somehow, you know, my parents still managed, you know, to c ontinue.  But it was  
c er tainly a major, m ajor s tep, a m ajor c hange.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  As we'll dis c us s  in a m inute, s hortly thereafter your fam ily goes  into liter al hiding 
but they made s ome earlier  attem pts at hiding or minimizing their J ewis h identity.  Tell us  about your  

s is ter 's  s chooling, when they wanted to c hange that.
 
> > Al Munzer : Well, my s is ter s were enrolled in a Catholic  s c hool, actually .  It's a s c hool I vis ited 
r ec ently, actually.  I have a pic tur e of them all dres s ed up, partic ipating in a pr oc ess ion, a typic al 
Catholic  proc es s ion.  You know, pretending, really, to be Catholic .  So that was  their firs t attem pt of 
hiding their J ewis h identity.
 

5 
 
 
I'm not quite s ur e when that happened, whether that was  before I was  born or after I was  born.  
I think  it might have been afterwar ds .
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  Speaking of your bir th, ear ly in 1941, your par ents  realized s omething s urpr is ing.  
Yo
ur  m other was  pregnant.
 
> > Al Munzer :  Ear ly in 1941 m y mother found out that s he was  pr egnant again, her thir d pr egnanc y, an 

unplanned pr egnanc y.  She went to s ee her obstetric ian who told her  in no unc er tain term s that s he 

ought to have an abortion.  He 
told her that it would be imm or al to bring another J ewis h life into the 
world.  My m other  wasn't partic ular ly r eligious  but s he turned to the Bible for  advic e at that tim e.  She 

r ead the stor y of a woman c alled Hannah.  Hannah was  a wom an who was desper ately to have a child.  
She would go to the temple every year and pr ay that s he m ight c onc eive.  She m ade this  pledge to 
God, if the alm ighty will give m e a c hild, I will give that c hild to the s ervic e of God, all the days  of his  or  

her  life.  And it was  in reading of Hannah's  agonizing des ir e to have a child that m y mother dec ided that 
s he c ould not have an abor tion.
  
Her obstetric ian fired her as  a patient.  And s o November
 
1941 is  
when I was  bor n with the help of a nurs e at home. 
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  J ust as  a parent, pr egnanc y, new life is  fr aught but bringing a new life into the 
world in the m idst of war  as  a J ewis h parent, I c an only imagine the fear and anxiety your  parents mus t 
have felt.
 
> > Al Munzer :  Yeah, espec ially sinc e J ewis h, male c hildren, traditionally, the fir st miles tone in their life 
is  to
 
--
 
is  the c ir c umc is ion c erem ony eight days  after  their birth.  And jus t like the obstetric ian had 
ear lier, my parents ' friends  s aid don't have him  c ir c um c is ed
; i
t would identify him as  being J ewis h.
 
 
But t
his tim e the ans wer  to my parents' dilem ma came in the form of a wor ried look  on the 
face of the pediatr ic ian who had jus t exam ined me.  My father  turned and s aid, "Is there anything wrong 

with the baby?"  And the pediatr ic ian s aid, "No.  It's  jus t that your s on will need a minor  oper ation we 

c all a c irc um c is ion."  So m y father told him of our  J ewis h tr adition.  And eight days  later, it was  probably 
the las t s uc h c eremony in our hom e.  
 
 
I had found s ome amazing photographs  of the event, of m y c ircum c is ion cer em ony wher e you 
c an s ee the whole family  gather ed around the table, inc luding my s is ter s , my father , my 
U
nc le 
E m il
, a 
lot of other  people and another pic tur e that has  me on a pillow.
  
What's  very s pec ial about these 
photogr aphs is  that there ar e only ab
out
 
--
 
they are only about 1
-
by
- 1 
1/2 in s ize.  My m other was  to 
keep thos e two photographs  hidden on her body, in her hair, thr ough her  stay in 12 c onc entration 
c am ps.  And s he had this  s upers tition, this feeling, that if s he ever lost thos e photogr aphs, it would 
m ean that I had been killed or I had died.  Fortunately I s ur vived, m y m other s ur vived, and the 
photogr aphs s ur vived.  They ar e now par t of the collec tion of the mus eum . 
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  Thank  you for tr usting us with thos e.  It's  a treas ure, a treas ure.
 
> > Al Munzer :  Yes.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  I wonder.  You may have been if not the last am ong the las t J ewis h baby boys to 
be named, c ir c umc is ed for m any year s . 
 
 
So over  the next 10 months  after your birth, by Septem ber
 
1942, c onditions  for J ews  
in 
Holland had bec om e far wor s e and your parents dec ided that the fam ily mus t go into hiding if they wer e 

to s ur vive.  Tell us mor e about this  dec is ion, the arrangements they m ade, the fac tors.
 
> > Al Munzer : Well, my father had rec eived a c all to report f
or s o
-
c alled labor duty.  He knew what that 
m eant.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  Can you explain what that meant?  Our  audienc e likely does  not know.
 
> > Al Munzer :  They knew that m eant being s ent to a c amp, in Holland, a labor c am p.  One of the many 
types  of c onc en
tration c amps that we now know exis ted at the time, with a very good c hanc e of being 

s ent on to a plac e like Aus c hwitz later  on.  So it really was  a major  r eas on to tr y to avoid being s ent to 
thos e cam ps.
 
 
So the fir st thing m y father  did was  to undergo a her nia operation
 
whic h he had been 
pos tponing for a long time.  That gained him a little bit of time.
  
After that, he had a mock  s uic ide 
attem pt.  That gained him  adm is s ion to a ps yc hiatr ic  hos pital.  So he was  hos pitalized there as  a 

6 
 
patient, pretend patient.  And that, too, s or t of avoided him  being c alled to the labor c am p.  He was  
ther e bas ic ally in hiding as  wer e m any other J ews . 
 
 
A wom an who was  a c los e fr iend of m y m other's
 
--
 
m y parents' neighbor s told her pries
t that 
s he had a vis ion of the v
ir gin
 
telling her to tak e J ewis h c hildr en into hiding.  So s he m ade an offer  to her 
pr ies t.  His nam e was  Father Luthers .  I m et him after the war .  He in tur n appr oac hed m y m other.  My 

m other  entr usted m y two s is ter s , with all their  belongings
, 
to this  wom an's
 
c ar e.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  So it was  not a woman s he k new?
 
> > Al Munzer :  This was  not a wom an s he had known, no.  And that left her, of c ours e, alone in the 

house with a little baby.
  
My m other was  s o afr aid at the time of the Nazi soldiers  c oming to the 
home, 
the SS coming to our  hom e.  She was  afr aid of the sound of the r inging bell it was  m aking.  So s he 

c over ed the bell with c loth so that it wouldn't awak en her or wouldn't frighten her.
  
Then s he s aid s he 
s pent the night sitting on the c hairs , watc hing
 
the c lapper  of the bell to s ee whether  it moved.  So it did 
not r elieve any of her  anxiety.
 
 
And then finally, her  neighbor, a woman by the name of Annie Magna, agreed to take m e in.  
So my mother handed me over with m y c r ib, my belongings .  She c los ed the hous e wher e we lived for 

the las t tim e.  She joined m y father in the s am e ps yc hiatric  hos pital, in her c as e pr etending to be a 
nur s e's as s istant.  She did not want to be a patient
, s h
e told m e. 
 
So they went into hiding ther e.  So the 
whole family by th
a
t point was in
 
hiding.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  If I could inter rupt a s ec ond.  I jus t want to make s ur e that the audienc e 

unders tands the ris k s  that people wer e under taking by agr eeing to shelter a J ewis h c hild and even the 
logis tic s  of having to feed a hidden
 
m outh in the hous e.  Could you talk about that a bit, pleas e? 
 
> > Al Munzer :  Yes.  In m y c as e, es pec ially, and c ertainly in the c as e of my s is ter s
, 
s inc e we wer e in 
the hom e illegally and everything was  str ic tly rationed, ther e wer e no rationed c oupons , 
you know, for 

us  bec aus e we wer e there illegally.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  For  food.
 
> > Al Munzer :  For food.  So the fam ily really had to s crounge ar ound for  bas ic  food s tuff.  That was  
c er tainly the c as e for m e and als o for m y s is ter s.
  
In addition to that, what they wer e doing was  illegal.  
They c ould have been arr es ted.  They could have been s ent to pr is on.  They c ould have los t their lives  
for r eally tr ying to res c ue a J ew.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  In the c as e of the wom an who was  s heltering your  s isters, thes e wer e s trangers ' 

c hildren.  She did not know them befor e.  Your par ents als o were tr usting their young daughters  to a 
family they did not know.
 
> > Al Munzer :  Exac tly. 
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  How did you m ove fr om being with Annie to being in the home of Tole Madna who 

we s aw ear lier ?
 
> > Al Munzer :  Annie Madna had s om e r un
-
ins with the Germ an author ities  s o s he was  really afraid to 
keep m e in the hous e.  She felt it put m e at risk .  So s he pas s
ed 
m e on initially to her s ister.  Then it 
turned out that her s is t er had a neighbor who was  a mem ber of the Dutc h Nazi Party.  Holland had a 

huge Nazi Par ty of its  own.  So s he got s c ar ed.  She was  afr aid that the neighbor m ight hear a little 
baby c rying and would as k  her who the baby was  and find out that s he was  hiding
 
a J ewis h baby.  So 
s he pas s ed m e back  to her s ister, to Annie.  And then Annie r eally almos t as  a last r es ort pas s ed m e 

on to her ex
-
hus band Tole Madna.  He was  an Indones ian m an.  They had been m arr ied and divor c ed.  
They had joint custody of their thr ee
 
c hildren.  So I joined Tole Madna and the three Madna c hildr en
,
  
One c auc as ian
-
looking child with three kids  who looked very, ver y differ ent.  Annie Madna was  Dutc h 
but Tole Madna was  Indones ian. 
 
 
The pers on who really took care of me when I was  with Tole Madna was  the nanny who had 
taken car e of the three Madna c hildr en, 
Dewi, Wilhi, 
and Robby
.  I bec ame her baby and s he bec ame 
m y mother.  And s he was  an amazing wom an.  She did not s peak  any Dutc h.  She was  c ompletely 

illiter ate
, c ould not r ead or  write 
a
nd the only language s he spoke was  the Indonesian language whic h 
we now c all Bahas a we then c alled Malay
. 
 
She would walk m iles  ever y day jus t to get s om e m ilk  for 
m e.  As I s aid, you know, there were no ration c oupons  for m e.
 

7 
 
 
Ac tually, a few year s  ago when I was  back  in Holland, a woman appr oached me and s aid, 
ﬁY
ou know, you drank  my m ilk.
ﬂ
  
I asked, "What do you m ean?"  She s aid, 
ﬁW
ell, all s c hool c hildr en in 
Holland were given a little bottle of milk every day.  And m y m other told me to s ave half that 
little bottle 
for the baby next door.
ﬂ
  
And I was  that baby next door.
  
So her e you have a young c hild 6, 7 year s old 
par ticipating in s aving a hum an life.  Really, really amazing.
 

 
Mima

I s lept in Mim a's  bed.  I'm told that s he kept a knife under her p
illow vowing to kill any 
Nazi who might tr y to c ome and get m e or  even k ill me rather than to have m e fall in their hands .  An 
am azing, am azing wom an.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg: Was  s he a religious  woman? 
 
> > Al Munzer :  She
 
--
 
we'r e not even s ur e of her religion.  She was  pr obably Mus lim .  I'm told with a 
heav y Buddhis t influenc e.  And I'm  told that s he k ept a little altar in the hous e.  She would put little bits  
of food stuff ther e.  And this  was  s om ething I found out ver y rec
ently from one of m y 
foster
 
s isters.  And 
nobody was  allowed to touc h thos e little bits  of food until a few days  had pas s ed and then ever ybody 

c ould par tak e.  So s he was  religious in that s ens e but we never  really knew ver y muc h about her  
r eligion.
 
 
My fos
ter father was  nominally Catholic .  His  ex
-
wife 
Annie
 
was  protestant.  So a whole m ix.  
My f
oster s is ter  sor t of takes pr ide in the fac t that she c ounted five and a half r eligions repr es ented in 
the family counting m e as  half s inc e I was  s o little, half J e
wis h.

[Laughter] 
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  Your  parents, their c hildren ar e in hiding but the day after Christmas , 1942, what 
happened to them ?  They had been in the ps yc hiatric  hos pital.
 
> > Al Munzer :  On Chris tm as  day ther e was  one mor e wonderful thing that happened with m y par ents .  

It was  the last tim e that m y two s is ter s wer e taken to them  for a vis it.  Very high risk .  But they did 

m anage to have a m inor reunion that day.  Then jus t two days  later , the psyc hiatric  hos pital was  empty 
of all patients  and
 
staff and they wer e all ar res ted and s ent on, first to a c onc entr ation c am p in Holland.  
Well, firs t, to a pr is on in Holland.  And then fr om there to c onc entr ation c amp in Holland, Wester bork.  

So that was  fir st of about 12 c onc entration c amp that my parents wer e to vis it.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg: Wher e wer e they taken after Westerbork?
 
> > Al Munzer :  AfterWes ter bork m y parents  were taken to a c onc entration c am p in s outher n Holland, 

Vught, which was  the headquar ters  of the 
P hilips
 
elec tronic s  com pany.  My par e
nts  were ass igned to 
do work , s lave labor, for 
P hilips
 
Elec tronic s .  My mother  learned fr om the grapevine that one of the key 
needs  of the Germans , of the German Arm y, was  for r adio tubes .  So s he lear ned how to as s emble 
r adio tubes.  And that's what kept 
her  alive initially in Vught.
 
 
My m other told m e that there would be a lineup ever y m or ning in the c oncentration c amp.  All 
the pris oners would line up.  And one day a m an by the name of Heinric h Himm ler  ac tually addr ess ed 

the cr owd.  He told them to all c
ontinue wor king for 
the s ucc es s  of the Reic h, that nothing bad would 
ever  happen to them. 
 
My m other told m e that while he was  talking
 
--
 
this was  early, early in the 
m or ning, dawn
 
--
 
s he s aw the s pire of a little Dutc h c hurc h in the distanc e.  She wondered how 
wonder ful it would be if peac e wer e to break  out at that mom ent and s he could just r un to that little 
c hur ch and fall on her knees  and thank  God for having been freed and for s urviv ing.  She didn't c are 
whether  it was  a c hur c h, a s ynagogue or a m osque, jus t a plac e to thank God for her  s urvival.  But that 
was n't to be.
  
The pr omise fr om Heinr
ic h Himm ler  didn't m atter.  J
ust a few months later  Vught was  
em ptied of all inm ates, of all J ews .  They were all s ent on to Aus c hwitz, inc luding my parents. 
 
>> 
Edna Fr iedberg: Were your  parents  s epar ated at this  point?
 
> > Al Munzer :  It was  in Aus c hwitz that m y par ents  were s epar ated.  My father was  as s igned to working 
in a factor y in Ausc hwitz where he remained I believe for  about s ix months at leas t, maybe even longer .  
My m other was  s ent on to another c am p.  Fortunately they were not s elected to be killed imm ediately in 
Aus c hwitz like many other s .  She was  s ent on to another c am p where s he was  as s igned to s lave labor  
for the Telefunken factory, elec tr onic s fac
tory, doing the s ame kind of work , as s em bling r adio tubes. 
 
 
Rec ently I found
 
--
 
it's amazing how doc um ents  are still appear ing.  So r ec ently thr ough the 
r es earch s er vic e her e at the mus eum , I found a little s lip of paper that had m y father 's  number as a 

8 
 
p
r is oner in Aus c hwitz, no nam e.  T hen it s aid in Ger man "Pr em ium Em ployee" and a s ignatur e.  I asked 
the r es ear c her  what this  m eant.  He s aid it meant that your  father's wages  at the fac tory where he did 
his  s lave labor  had to be paid to the SS and that he war ranted a pr emium level of pay.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  Because of his  skills .
 
> > Al Munzer :  Bec aus e of his  skills .
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  But not paid to him .  He was  a s lave labor er .
 
> > Al Munzer :  A s lave labor er.  Paid to the Nazis .  J ust an amazing little
 
detail that I had never hear d 
about before. 
 
 
My m other told m e that in the Telefunken factory, one of the things  that gave her  s tr ength and 
gave her hope was  that ther e were m any Germ an s oldier s  who had been repatr iated from the easter n 
fr ont and they were minus an ar m or a leg, s ever ely injur ed wor king alongside her .  They wer e s o 

vehemently anti
-
Nazi, anti
-
Hitler  that they would do everything to really s abotage the oper ations of the 
factor y.  My mother des cr ibed that s he, too, actually par tic ipated in little acts  of s abotage.  She would 

s pend a whole day as s em bling one radio tube ver y c arefully.  And then at the end of the day when the 
s iren was  s urr ounded, indic ating the end of the workday, s he would put that
 
--
 
take the radio tub
e a
par t, 
put it back in
 
the drawer and s tar t the pr oc es s  all over again the following day.  She took som e pride in 
not enhanc ing Ger many's  c apac ity to do war .
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  Small ways  to maintain her m or ale.
 
> > Al Munzer :  In s m all ways .  Other ways  were tr ying to obs er ve J ewis h holidays .  

F
inding
 
--
 
pretending to go to
 
--
 
es pec ially the holiday of Hanuk k ah when c andles  ar e lit.  My m other
 
--
 
of c o
urs e, they did not have c andles .  They did not have a c andelabra, menor ah
.  S
o my m other  went 
to the infirm ar y and told them  that s he was  having her m enstr ual period and needed lots  of cotton.  She 
got wa
d
s  of c otton
 a
nd then a little bit of oil fr om the mac hine s he worked.  And that's  how they wer e 
able to light c andles  for Hanuk kah.  It was  that kind of ac tivity, I think
, 
that ke
pt her alive.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  Even how you des c r ibed her hiding thos e two tiny pic tur es of you in her hair, that's 

an ac t of s pir itual res is tanc e as  well.
 
> > Al Munzer :  Ver y m uch s o.  I've often wondered how my m other s ur vived.  She witnes s ed the 

bom b
ing of the Telefunk en factor y.  She said the tr aditional J ewis h pr ayer  of thanks to God for having 

s ur vived to s ee that day as  s he s aw the flam es going up.
  
But that was  not the end of her or deal.  
Bec aus e as  des c r ibed in a book , s he was  then put on a Death Mar c h as the pris oners  wer e gradually 

m oved back wes t.  But even there m y m other
 
--
 
somewhere along the way  s he was put back  in one of 
thos e cattle c ars.  She told me that s he was  able to take a glim ps e of the countrys ide, a glimps e of the 

c ountr ys ide outs ide.  She s aw the beautiful s pringtim e.  And s he s aid to her s elf, you know, after the war 

we'r e not going to have muc h money but this would not be a bad way to see the beauty of a 
c ountr ys ide. 
 
I think  it was  that kind of s pir it that really allowed m y mo
ther  to r em ain alive until s he was  
finally freed at the Danish border.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  Of cour s e, during this  per iod s he had absolutely no infor m ation about the fate of 
her  thr ee young c hildr en.  She had s een your  s is ters , as  you m entioned, that final time not knowing it 

was  the final time.  Tell us  what happened to your s is ter s , pleas e.
 
> > Al Munzer : Well, s adly, the hus band and wife had a fight.  It turned out that the hus band in the 
family wher e my s is ters were in hiding actually had been a m ember o
f the Dutc h Nazi P ar ty.  His wife 
was  unaware of that.  He denounc ed his wife as hiding two J ewis h c hildren to the Nazis .  His  wife was  

taken pr is oner and, of c our s e, m y two s is ters wer e taken as well.
  
His  wife eventually was  freed but m y 
two s is ter s were
 
imm ediately s ent on to Wester bork and after jus t a day ther e were put on the tr ans port 
to Auschwitz where they were killed Februar y
 
11, 1944.  They were just 6 and 8 years  old at the time. 
 
 
Las t year , whic h was  the 70th anniversary of their death, was  really a time when I c ame fully 
to gr ips  with m y los s , with the los s  of m y s is ters.
  
As  a young c hild gr owing up with the Holoc aus t, I 
r eally
 
--
 
I was  about 3
 
1/2 years old when the Holoc aus t
 
--
 
after the war , 4, 5 years  old.  I r eally had little 
unders tandi
ng what had happened.  I thought part of The Hague was  just reduc ed to rubble.  I thought 
walking ac r os s  fields  through r ubble to vis it fr iends of m y mother was  jus t the norm al activity, that ever y 

c ity was  like that, or playing hide and s eek in bunkers  on
 
the beac h.  I thought that was  norm al.
 

9 
 
And then there wer e thes e photographs of thes e two beautiful girls  on the wall.  My mother's neighbor  
would tell me that my s is ter Eva had s ome beautiful handwr iting, even when s he was  jus t 6 year s old.  I 
would ac tually, as  a little c hild, be s omewhat jealous  of m y two s is ters.  I had no c ompr ehens ion at all 
initially of what had happened to them .  That just c ame on ver y, very gr adually over the years.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  As you m atur ed, did you ever feel guilty for  s urviving while they did not? 
 
> > Al Munzer :  My mother would very often r emind m e of that pledge that Hannah made
, y
ou know
,  
that I talked about. 
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  Hannah in the Bible.
 
> > Al Munzer :  Yeah, if the almighty will give m e a c hild, I will give the c hild to the s er vic e of God all the 
days  of his  or  her  life.  My mother, whenever I was  bad, would r em ind m e of that pledge.
 
>> 
[Laughter]
 
> > Al Munzer :  It had a tremendous  ps yc hologic al effec t.  I think  that's  one r eas on I bec am e a doctor 
and one r eas on, you know, I volunteer her e at the mus eum.  I think  it had
 
--
 
it's  not guilt as m uc h but it 
c r eated I think  a s ens e of r es pons ibility.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  I'm  going to inter rupt you a sec ond.  Al is  ver y m odest.  After c oming to this  
c ountr y, he bec am e a highly res pected pulm onologis t, s pec ialis t in lung dis eas e, and later s erved as  
pr es ident of the Amer ic an Lung As s oc iation.  So he really has  m ore than fulfilled that pledge.
 
>>
 
[Applaus e]
 
> > Al Munzer :  I s ort of skipped over one event, the r eunion with m y mother .
 

> > Edna Fr iedberg:  I want to go b
a
ck  a little m ore.  We have not talked about the day
-
to
-
day r eality of 
your  life as  a c hild in hiding, a c hild who was  not s uppos ed to exis t.  You already mentioned being a 

white
-
skinned c hild in an Indones ian hous ehold.  Did neighbors know you wer e there?  How was  y our 
pr es enc e explained if s omeone s aw you?
 
> > Al Munzer :  I was  c er tainly not allowed out of the hous e.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  For  how long? 
 
> > Al Munzer :  For about three years  that I was  ther e.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  Three year s .  Tr y keeping a pres c hooler s till. 
 
> > Al Munzer :  The only view that I had of the outs ide wor ld was  what I c ould s ee through the mail s lot.  

That was  my view, total view, of the outs ide wor ld. 
 
 
There were a few neighboring kids  who appear in som e of the photogr aphs who were allowed 
to play with m e.  They were Germans but they were c omm unis ts.  It was  a Communis t fam ily, ver y 
s taunc hly anti
-
fascist, anti
-
Nazi.  So they wer e tr usted to com e into the hous e and play with me.
 
 
I have only happy m em or ies being with
 
the Madna fam ily.  I r em ember Papa Madna play ing 
on the piano.  I r em ember  Mim a s inging s ongs  to m e in the Indones ian language.  That was  my native 

tongue, ac tually. 
 
 
Oc c asionally I r em ember having to go into hiding.
  
I didn't know what that meant.  It was  only 
in r etros pect.  I would have to go into a s mall c ellar bec aus e the hous e was  being s ear c hed.  But that's 
wher e the fam ily kept all of their  Chr is tm as  dec orations .  I do r emember playing with thos e dec or ations . 
 
One of thos e m em or ies that has r emained with me.
 
 
And then I remem ber one tim e my two s is ters, my 
foster
 
s is ters, wer e doing their hom ework.  I 
s aw them wr iting.  So I took  a pen and s tar ted s cr ibbling, typic al 3
-

old, and tr ied to im itate.  They 
laug
hed.  I remember getting ver y, ver y angr y at them  bec aus e of that.  Again, one of thos e m emories  
that has  s tayed with m e.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  So for  three years they kept you indoor s .  They managed to feed you.  They loved 

you.  They nurtured you.  And then the war ended in 
May
 
1945, ended in Eur ope with Ger m any's 
s ur r ender.  Your m other, who managed to s urvive, who you didn't rem em ber , c am e to
 
find you.  Tell us  
about that 
r eunion.
 
> > Al Munzer :  My mother had been freed at the Danis h bor der through the negotiation of the fr eedom 
of s everal thousand J ewis h women.  She was , of c our s e, in a terr ible state and was  s ent on to Sweden 
for r ehabilitation, for  r ec uper ation.
  
In August
 
1945 is  when s he returned to Holland.  That's when I was  
r eunited with my mother .
 

10
 
 
 
I r ec ently had a c onversation with my 
foster
 
s is ter and s he told me that the first house m y 
m other  c ame to was  her m other's home.  That's wher e s he had left m e.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  Right.  So as  far as  s he knew, you wer e s till there. 
 
> > Al Munzer :  So she ans wer ed the door and ther e was  my m other  whom  s he did not r eally r emember 
very well.  And m y m other asked about the wher eabouts  of m y s is ter and about m e.  So it was  up to 
this  15
-
year
-
old to tell her , well, I r eally don't know anything about your  daughter s, Eva and Lea
h
, but I 
do know wher e your little s on went to.  
 
 
By the way, you know, childr en placed in hiding wer e given a new name.  So I had been given 
the nam e Bobby.  And to this  day whenever  I talk to the Madna family, it's  always  Bobby. 
 
For m
any 
year s  I thought that I was  c alled Bobby bec aus e that's what the dog was  called.
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
> > Al Munzer :  The r eason being that if people hear d Bobby being c alled, they would think , well, they'r e 
jus t calling the dog.  Then one of m y 
foster
 
s ibling
s  s et m e straight a few years  ago and s aid, no, the 
dog's  nam e 
was  
T
eddy not Bobby.
 
>> 
[Laughter]
 
> > Al Munzer :  So there went that theory.  I m ay have been called Bobby bec aus e the Madna s on, their 

c hild, was  c alled Robby.  So bec aus e the two names  wer e so c los e together , people m ight think Robby 
was  jus t being c alled.  So that's how I c am e to the name Bobby. 
 
 
So s he told m y m other when m y m other  r etur ned, where I was.  She took  m y m other to the 
Madna hom e.  I was  as leep in one of the back r ooms .  I remem
ber  being awakened.  Typic al 
3 
1/2
-
year
-
old, s omething like that, I was  c ar ried into the living r oom  c r ying, cr anky.  So the whole 
family was  s itting in a c irc le and I was  pas s ed fr om  l
ap
 
to lap, the way you typic ally do with a c r ying 
c hild.  And what I do
 
r emember is  ther e was  one lap I wouldn't s it in and that was  m y own m other 
bec aus e s he was  obvious ly a c om plete stranger to m e.  I already had a mother and that was  Mim a 
Saina.  
 
 
So my mother dec ided that Mim a ought to c ontinue to c ar e for  m e while s he, 
you know, m y 
m other  went on looking for  wor k .  But that was n't to be bec aus e two months  later, in October
 
1945, 
Mima s uffer ed a cer ebral hem or rhage and pas s ed away.  And ac tually, I have no rec ollec tions , no 
m em or ies  at all of Mim a exc ept, you know, a few 
words  of the Indones ian language that I remem ber.  
And I do r em em ber vis iting her gr ave.  So many years later when I went back  to The Hague and went 
to the c emetery, I was  able to find m y way to the grave
 
bec aus e
 
I had been ther e so m any tim es before 
as  a young c hild. 
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg: What happened to your father? 
 
> > Al Munzer :  My father r em ained in Aus c hwitz for about s ix months.  He was  then s ent on to 
M
authaus en
, another  terrible c onc entr ation c amp wher e J ews  were for c ed to c arr y 
--
 
thes e other 
pr is oner s
 
forc ed to c ar ry thes e huge blocks up a ramp where m any of them  would be tripped and then 
fall down and be killed.
 
 
After 
Mauthausen
, in Austri
a
, he was  s ent on to thr ee m or e c am ps  in Austr ia
: Gusen, Steyr,
 
and then 
Ebens ee
, which was  one of the mos t beautiful s pots  in the world.  Many people pr obably ar e 

fam iliar  with the m ovie "The Sound of M
us ic ."  That's wher e it was  filmed.  In fac t, you know, ther e was  
Edelweiss
 
s tr olling in that form er c am p.  
 
 
My father was  as s igned to doing s lave labor in abandoned s alt m ines as s em bling V2 rockets
, 
te
r rible, ter rible work.  He s urvived to s ee liber ation by the U.S. Army in May
 
1945 but his c ondition was  
s o poor, he was  s o weak, that he pass ed away two m onths  later s t ill in a conc entr ation c am p in 
Ebens ee
.  
That's  wher e he was  bur ied.  
 
 
I vis ited his  gr ave in the form er c oncentration c amp.  It's standing at his  gr ave that I r eally firs t 
fully c am e to gr ips with the los s  that I had suffer ed.  I broke out in tears.  I had been ther e twic e.  And 

this  happened both tim es .  It's r eally wher e I felt, you know, I never  knew m y father  exc ept through the 
s tories my mother  had told m e and through photographs .  But standing ther e at his  gr ave really, really 
hit m e very har d.

> > Edna Fr iedberg:  Do you know how your m other  found out that your s ister s had died, had been 
killed? 
 
> > Al Munzer :  I'm not s ur e.  She found out very quic kly after s he had arriv ed in Holland.  Again, I don't 

know how m y mother  m anaged to deal with that news .  I think  what really k ept her alive and
 
allowed 
her  to res um e a norm al life after  her  or deal, after her  tr emendous  los s of her  hus band and two beautiful 

daughters, was the fac t that s he had me to c ar e for .  That's what s he s aid.  I think  that's  really
 
--
 
that 
r eally was  the c ase.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  One m or e question before we open to questions  from the audienc e bec aus e we're 

alm ost out of time.  You mentioned to m e an inc ident that happened to you and your  m other s till in 
Holland s hortly after the war when you were going to the m ovies .  If you could tell us  about that, pleas e. 
 
> > Al Munzer :  Sur e. We wer e s tanding in line to go to the m ovies
, I
 
think  a news reel.  A m an standing 
behind us  s aw the number, the tattoo that had been tattooed in Aus c hwitz on her arm .  He pointed to it 

and he s aid, "There's  one they didn't get."  So, you know, anti
-
Sem itis m r eally c ontinued after the war , 
even in enlightened a plac e as  Holland.  It was n't the end of hatr ed.  My m other after that kept her arm 

c over ed.  She war  three
-
quar ter length s leeves  for  the r es t 
of her life.  I r eally never even c ould 
r em em ber what the number  was  bec aus e I har dly ever saw it. 
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  In rec ent year s your  experienc e, your love for  the Madna fam ily, has  actually given 
you s ome new relations hips  with young people from  Indones ia.  Could you tell us  about thos e, please?
 

> > Al Munzer :  About two years  ago m y story was  br ought to the attention of a gr oup of Indones ian 
s tudents brought to the United States  to lear n what it is  to live in a m ulti
-
c ultural s oc iety, m ulti
-
faith 
so
c iety.  I was  invited to speak  to them.  When I fir s t s tar ted s peaking and I s howed a photogr aph of 
Mima holding m e, there was  a gas p in the air when I told them that I was  the baby s he was  holding.  
And then at the ver y end of m y talk  I s aid, you I k now, I vaguely r emember  Mim a s inging a lullaby to 

m e.  It was  c alled "
Nina B
obo."  And all 25 s tudents  started s inging it in unison.  It was  an inc r edibly 
beautiful moment.  After that, you know, young wom en wearing head sc arves , traditional Mus lim  head 

s c ar ves
, c ame up to m e, hugged me, kis s ed m e and s aid, you know, we're all family.  It was  just
 
an 
inc r edibly 
power ful m oment.  It s hows  the power r eally of the s tory, of the r es c ue by the Madna fam ily 
and the impact it has on people. 
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  Thank  you, Al. 
 
 
We have a few m inutes for  questions .  Pleas e r ais e your  hand if you have a question.  Do we 
have mic s ? We'll pass  mic r ophones s o people in the audienc e c an hear wherever  they ar e s eated.
 
>> 
My question is , after Mima died and you wer e with your  
mom  fr om  then on?
 
> > Al Munzer :  Yes.  After  Mim a died, I r em ained with my m other .  She initially m anaged to s ell the 

c loth that had r em ained fr om m y father 's tailoring s hop.  That's how s he made a living initially.  Then 
s he acquir ed a cosm etic s  s tor e.  That's  how s he c ontinued to make a living until we finally m oved to 
Belgium  and then ultimately in 1958 em igrated to the United States.  My m other
 
just wanted to get 
away fr om all the mem ories  in Europe.  She never went back  to Holland after we c ame to the 
United 

States.  She tr aveled but never to Holland.
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  Or to her birthplac e in Poland either.
 
> > Al Munzer :  Or to Poland.  I have been back  there.  Sever al year s  ago I rec eived a m es s age through 

the Mus eum of a c omm em or ation of the day when all the rem aining J ews  in that little town, Rymanow, 
were deported.  I dec ided after s om e hes itation to go.  It was  r eally an amazing vis it.  It's  an 
idyllic
 
little 
town, just like m y m other des c r ibed.  And, again, to realize that thous ands  of Jews  were 
deported from  

that little town on one day is  jus t m ind boggling
 h
ow that was pos sible. 
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  Inc luding the extended fam ily you never  knew.
 
> > Al Munzer :  Exac tly. 
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  Other  questions ? 
 
 
Ok.  I have a favor to ask  of you.  In
 
a m om ent I will turn to Al.  It's  our  tr adition here at
 
Fir st 
Person
 
that the
 
First Pers on
 
has  the las t word in the pr ogr am.  When he's  finis hed talking, if you would 
all pleas e s tand and remain s tanding for a m oment, our photographer, J oel, will c om e on stage and 

12
 
 
take a really nic e portr ait of Al with you in the back ground in order to c apture our  exper ienc e her e 
today.
 
 
With that, Al, clos ing thoughts , pleas e. 
 
> > Al Munzer : Well, you know, the s tor y of the Holoc aus t is  r eally a hor r or , one of horr or.  T he ter rible 
c ons equenc es  that begin with hatr ed, hating anybody.  My take fr om m y own s tor y is  that even with all 
of this  evil all around them , in a s ea of evil, it was  s till pos s ible for  a few people to do the r ight thing and 

to s ave a human life and to take that r isk.  I think we all, you know, c ould lear n from  that
, t
o s tand up to 
evil wherever  we s ee
 
it.  When we hear s om eone s ay I hate s o
-
and
- so 
jus t s ay, you know, don't use 
that language.  We are all meant to love eac h other as human beings  regar dles s
 
of who we ar e or what 
we ar e.  I think that's really the m es s age that I would like to leave people with. 
 
> > Edna Fr iedberg:  Thank  you for s har ing your stor y today.
