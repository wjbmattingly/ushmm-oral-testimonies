Dor a Klayman was  born Teodora Bas c h on J anuar y
 
31, 1938, in Zagreb, Yugos lavia. Her e we 
s ee Dor a s itting on a park  benc h with her younger  brother , Zdravko.
 

 
On this  map of Yugos lavia in 1933, the arr ow points  to Zagr eb.
 
 
In this  photo we s ee Dora on an outing to the zoo with her par ents, Salamon and Silva. 
Salam on ran a brus h
-
m aking factory and Silva was  a teac her.
 
 
Pic tured here is Dor a's  mater nal gr andfather, Rabbi J os ef Leopold Deutsc h. In April
 
1941, 
when Dor a was  visiting her  m ater nal gr andpar ents  in the small town of Ludbreg, Germ any invaded 

Yugoslavia. Ludbreg became par t of a puppet s tate r un by the Ustas a, Croatian fasc is ts.

In J une
 
1941, Dora's  parents  and her brother wer e arres ted. Their hous ek eeper  got baby 
Zdr avko out of pris on and from then on Dora and Zdr avko wer e s helter ed by their  m other 's s is ter, Giza, 
and her hus band, Ljudevit. On the left we s ee Aunt Giza. On the right we s ee her hus band, Ljudevit. 
The photo of Ljudevit was  taken m any year s after this one of
 
Giza.
 
 
Later in the war Aunt Giza was  denounc ed and s ent to Aus c hwitz wher e s he per is hed. Dora 
r em ained in Yugos lavia until 195
8 
when s he em igrated to the United States .
 
 
We c los e with this  portr ait of Aunt Giza, Dora and Zdr avko that was  taken to be s ent s o 
Ljudevit in the c onc entration c am p where he had been s ent.
 

          
 
In 1957, as Dor a was  on her  way to Switzerland, s he met Daniel Klayman, who was  returning 
to New York fr om  a year  of post
-
doctoral s tudy as a Fulbright s c holar in India. They were married in 
Switzerland a year later, and together they arr ived in the United States in the fall of 1958. By the 

following year  Dan and Dor a c am e toWas hington, DC, and Dan em barked on a c ar eer  as  a r es earc her 
in m edic inal chem istr y at the Walter  Reed Army Ins titute of Res ear c h; his  work c ulm inated in his 
expertis e in drug developm ent agains t m alar ia.
 
          
 
After the birth of their  two c hildren, Wanda and Elliot, Dor a r es um ed her  educ ation, getting 
degr ees  in Frenc h and in Englis h as  a Sec ond Language. She then taught in Montgom er y 
County, 

Maryland, Public  Sc hools, inc luding 23 years at Bethes da
-
Chevy Chas e High Sc hool, wher e s he 
headed the Englis h as  a Sec ond Language Departm ent.
 
          
 
Dan pas s ed away in 1992. Both of their c hildren live in the Washington ar ea.Wanda is  
Deputy 
Exec utive Dir ec tor of an inter national as soc iation that deals with is s ues  of tr ans portation. Elliot 
is  a freelanc e videographer  and owns  a video and film production c ompany. He is  m arried to Iona and 
they have three c hildr en, ages  21, 19 and 12.
 
          
 
After Dora r etir ed fr om full
-
tim e teac hing in 1999, s he bec am e active as a volunteer with this  
m us eum. Her work here c ons is ts  prim ar ily of tr ans lating m ater ial fr om the Holoc aus t written in Cr oatian, 

Bos nian, and Serbian. Her  ongoing projec t is  c onnec tedto the J as enovac  arc hive. As  we will hear later, 
J as enovac  was  a major c onc entr ation c am p in Croatia. 
 
 
Other  projec ts for  Dora have inc luded the tr ans lation of a booklet that ac c om panied a 1942 
anti
-
Semitic exhibit in Croatia, and the tr ans lation of the captions on a large arc hive of photographs that 
had been gathered dur ing the pos t
-
Wor ld War II tr ials  in Yugos lavia. To add to her language skills  Dora 
c ontinues  to lear n Hebr ew.
 
          
 
Dor a enjoys  tr aveling. She has  been to Is rael s everal times  where she was  happy to r eunite 
with her c ous ins and their  fam ilies . Some of her  travels  are c onnected to lear ning mor e about the 

events  and the after math of the Holoc aus t. She has  attended s ever al c onferenc es  of the International 

Organization of Child Sur vivor s , inc luding in Poland in 2011, when s he vis ited Aus c hwitz for the fir st 
tim e, and in Ber lin in 2014, wher e s he was  im pr ess ed by the effort m ade by that c ountry to teac h about 
and r emember  the Holocaus t. In 2013 s he tr aveled to her form er hom e in Cr oatia. During that tr ip she 
ac c ompanied the dir ec tor of the Jas enovac  arc hive to the s ite of the c onc entr ation c am p to view their 
exhibit. 
 
 
Dor a jus t r etur ned in late J une from  another trip to Croatia, to attend her high sc hool's  60th 
r eunion. Als o, s he vis ited the
 
s m all town of Ludbreg wher e s he s pent the war  year s  and m uc h of her  
youth.
 
          
 
Bes ides  Firs t Per s on, Dora is  s peaking public ly m or e. She rec ently s poke to a large gr oup in 
Ar k ans as , inc luding a group of junior high sc hool s tudents who hope to c ollec t s ix m illion pennies  to 
r epresent eac h of the s ix m illion J ews  who per is hed in the Holoc aus t.
 
          
 
With that, I would like you to join m e in welc oming our Fir st Pers on, Dor a Klayman.
 
> > [Applaus e]
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Dora, thank  you s o m uc h for joining us  and for  your willingnes s  to be our
 
Firs t Person
 
today. We have a s hort period and you have s o muc h to s har e with us  s o we'll jus t go r ight to it, if you 

don't m ind.
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  Sur e.

> > Bill Bens on:  Dora, you wer e just 3 years  old when World War II c am e direc tly to Yugos lavia in the 
s pr ing of 1941 when it was  attacked by Ger m any. Before we tur n to the hor rors  of the war  and the 
Holoc aus t, tell us , firs t, about your  par ents  and their  lives  and their c ommunity in the pr e
-
war years ,
 
a 
little bit a
bout them .
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  Ok . Well, the two families , my m other's family and m y father's  family, did not come 
fr om  the s am e plac e. My  father's  fam ily was  living in Zagr eb. The fam ily had c ome ther e not a ver y, 

very long time ago. I am  not s ure exac tly when but pr etty m uc h as  my father was  probably in his  teens .
 
There were s ix c hildren in the family. By the time war c ame the father  had alr eady pass ed away but the 

m other , their mother, was  living in Zagr eb. She was  eventually ac tually inter red in the Zagr e
b c emetery 
and I just managed to vis it her grave. She died of natur al c aus es .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  I think, if I c an just say, I think  you told me that that's  the only graves ite you have for 
any m em ber  of your fam ily.
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  Yes. That generation. Th
at generation, r ight.
 

 
So my father was , as you m entioned, r unning a sm all factory. He owned and oper ated it. But 
als o in his  extr a time he was als o ver y involved in being a c antor . They were a ver y obs ervant J ewis h 

family.
 
 
My m other's  family, on the 
other hand, lived in a small town of Ludbreg, whic h is  very far 
nor th, ver y c lose to the Hungar ian border . It was  a s m all c ommunity that had not a ver y large num ber  of 

J ews . I think about 70 or 100 or s omething like that. The c omm unity had exis ted for s om e
 
time but it 
didn't have a r abbi and so they found my gr andfather  
--
 
I don't rem em ber by what means, certainly not 
the inter net in thos e days
 
--
 i
n Slovakia. And he and his  wife and two c hildr en c am e to live in Ludbreg. 
They s ubs equently had two m or e c hildr en, two daughter s, two m or e daughters, 
B
lanka and finally m y 
m other , Silva. And my mother, ther efor e, was  15 years  younger than the older
 
--
 
her  older s ibling, Giza, 
who played a r ole later  on in m y life.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And becaus e Aunt Giza and her hus
band, 
U
nc le Ljudevit, played s uc h an important 
r ole in your  life, tell us a little bit about them .
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  They wer e both wor king for the Ludbreg bank. He was  a direc tor of one part of it 

and s he was  an employee. And, of c our s e, they were of diff
er ent religions bec aus e Ljudevit, like the 
rest of that town
, f
or the m os t part
, 
were all Catholic , Rom an Catholic . The two of them  fell in love. He 
was  a very impor tant m ember of that community. He had not only been working for  the bank but also 

he was  involved in jus t about everything. He was  an honor ary c hair pers on of the fir e br igade. He r an a 
c hoir and a c hamber m us ic  group. He played the violin. He was  ver y involved in that c ommunity. 
 
 
His  was  an unus ual family in that m ost of his s iblings
 
--
 
and ther e were 12 s iblings
 
--
 
had all, 
exc ept for one, prec eded him in death. So by the time war c ame ther e was  only one s is ter  that was  s till 

alive. Ever ybody els e had pass ed away. 
 
 
Befor e the war, while his m other was  alive, even though he and my aunt wer e in love they 
never m arr ied. They did m arr y but they did not mar r y for a long per iod of tim e. There was  no s uc h thing 
as  a c ivil m arriage in Yugos lavia at that time.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So only in the eyes  of the c hurc h?
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  Only in the eyes  of the chur c h or if he had c onverted to J udais m whic h was  fairly 
unlikely in those days  at that tim e. Then they c ould have been mar ried by the r abbi but not
 
--
 
they 
c ouldn't go to the City Hall and get m ar ried.
 
So eventually, however, in 1939, I think , 
t
hings  wer
e 
alr eady on the hor izon and they knew what was  happening in Germ any and s o on, they went to 
Hungar y and they got mar r ied in a c ivil c er em ony ther e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  It was  allowed in Hungar y.
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  It was  allowed in Hungar y. But one of the things I need to mention is that even 

though they were not m ar r ied pr evious ly
 
--
 
I don't know exac tly what kept them  fr om  m arr ying for so 
long. And, of c ours e, I asked him m any tim es  and he would always  deny that the r eas on was  r eligion. 

He would always  s ay: Well, s he was  quite happy living with her  family and I was  happy living with m y 
m other  and ther e was  no need to get m arr ied. 
 

4 
 
 
It's , of c our s e, a way of looking at it. But I know that there was  no gr eat anim os ity in the 
families . Bec aus e if I look  at the pic tur es , the photos , even the photo of one of my mother 's s is ter s ' 
weddings , he's always  ther e. He had s eemed to have been ac c epted as  a mem ber of the family ev en 
though they were not m arr ied for a long per iod of time.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Dora, when Germ any launched its  attack  on Yugos lavia on Augus t
 
6, 1941, whic h, of 
c our s e, was  r oughly 18 m onths after the war had begun els ewher e in Europe, you wer e away fr om 

Zagreb on a vis it with r elatives  in Ludbreg. Tell us what you c an, what you've been able to lear n, a
bout 
the c irc um stanc e that c aus ed you to be away fr om your  fam ily at that time and what happened onc e the 
Germ ans c ame into Yugos lavia.
 
> > Dora Klaym an: Well, m y brother  was  bor n in 1941, J anuary
 
1941. So that was  ver y r ec ent fr om the 
tim e that the war had s tar ted in Yugos lavia, whic h was  April
 
6. So I don't k now whether it was  bec aus e 
m y mother had a baby to deal with or  it was  just an opportunity but there wer e neighbor s of m y 
grandpar ents  who had come to vis it us in Zagreb and m y par ents  dec ided to s end
 
m e to vis it my 
grandpar ents  in Ludbreg. So I have m em or ies  of being on the tr ain. That was  very exc iting, even 
though I was 3. But that bas ic ally is  the last time I s aw m y par ents . Bec aus e then as war  began, I was  
at my gr andpar ents' house. That was  how I
 
ended up not being with my parents at a tim e and I was  not 
with them when they wer e arr es ted. And they were arres ted ver y s oon after  the outbreak  of the fac ilities  

and taken to a holding plac e whic h was  in Zagr eb wher e ever ybody was  bas ic ally gather ed bef
ore they 
were s ent off to the c oncentration c amp.
 
 
My brother, however , who was  with them

> > Bill Bens on: With war beginning in Eur op
e, 
September
 
1939
,  
and Germ any attacked eventually in 
A pr il
 
1941, Yugos lavia, do you know if your par ents  made any efforts to try to leave Cr oatia and go 
els ewher e during any of that time? 
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  I don't have any notion that they did. It was , I'm s ur e, ver y diffic ult to leave. There 
were efforts by s om e people, I know, who left for an ar ea held by the Italians , the souther n part of 
Yugoslavia. When thes e div is ions  c ame about, Germ any bas ic ally c eded one part of it to the Italians . 

The Italians wer e apparently known to have treated J ews  better  than either the loc al Us tas a, who ran 
so-
c alled independent s tate of Cr oatia, whic h was  a public  elem ent. And s o m any people did go t
o 
Rom as i
a. I have a few friends  who did do that, whos e family did that. I was  told that one of my aunts , 
m y Aunt Blanka and her  hus band and c hildr en did make it. But then the head of the government 
dec r eed that anybody that r etur ned would not be harm ed and s o they

> > Bill Bens on: Went bac k  home?
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  They went bac k  home.
 
 
My par ents , I have
 
no idea whether they ever  made
 
an attempt or not but they c er tainly did 
not s ucc eed.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Tell us a little bit about the Us tasa, that you just m entioned.Who wer e they and why 

were the Nazis  not running your part of Yugos lavia? 
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  They wer e ac tually a nationalis t gr oup that had gathered in Italy before the war . The 

his tory of Yugos lavia is  s o c omplic ated. Ther e wer e s o many c hanges. After  Wor ldWar I it bec am e 
Yugoslavia. It was  s ort of an almos t artific ially c r eated c ountry becaus e ther e wer e s o m any parts to it. 
The main parts  wer e, of c ours e, Ser bia and Cr oatia. And there were nationalis ts  within Cr oatia who 
wanted a pure Cr oatia, an independent Croatia. So they us ed the opportunity of the war to a
lign 
them s elves  with Ger many, with Naz is  in exc hange for  r unning the c ountr y the way Ger many wanted 

them to, they wer e able to s ec ur e the r ight to r un it by them s elves .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So they had their pur e c ountr y but it was  a puppet state.
 

> > Dor a K lay
m an:  It was  a puppet s tate of the Nazis . And they wer e bas ic ally r unning it the way the 
Nazis  wanted. And that inc luded ever ything that the Nazis  had alr eady perpetrated s inc e 1938. Or 

ear lier, even. Cer tainly all the r ules  and laws  that govern within Ger m any and the c ountries whic h they 

have c onquered s inc e

> > Bill Bens on:  Inc luding the way they tr eated Jews , es pec ially.
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  All the J ewis h, all the ques tions  of how
 
--
 
what was  banned to the J ews , anything 
that involved any ac c es s  to public  life; that included whether you s it on a benc h in the park, whether 
you par tic ipate in an orches tr a, whether you go to s c hool, whether  you
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on: Work ?
 

> > Dora Klaym an: Work , whether  you have ac c es s  to
 
food and s helter
, a
nything
,  
was  banned. So the 
s am e laws
 
--
 
and, of c ours e to wear a badge that identifies you. So all of that was  im mediately 
per petrated in Croatia. And Jews  wer e imm ediately is s ued badges. Som e of the badges are differ ent in 

differ ent c ountries. This one was  a yel
low s ilky
-
looking piec e of c loth on whic h ther e is  a Star  of David. 
There is  a pic tur e I have. It is  on the webs ite of this  mus eum s o people c an s ee it. My father, my 

m other , m y aunt, another  aunt, and one of m y c ous ins  are all wearing thes e.
 
So, you know,
 
lis ts of 
people. Everybody had to r epor t. They would s tart taking proper ty away. And they eventually s ent 
people to c amp.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And of cours e, as  you began to tell us  a few m inutes  ago, your par ents  were arr ested. 

They had your little brother with them at the time and they wer e s ent to a conc entr ation c amp.
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  Right. I will get to m y brother but I do want to s ay that one of the things that thes e 

Us tas a had in m ind, they per s ecuted J ews  as  part of the whole thing that the Nazis  per
petr ated; 
however , they had another  goal in addition to the goal that the Nazis  had. The Nazis
 
didn't c are one 
way or  another  about a pur e Cr oatia. And pure, to the Us tas a, meant not jus t pure of J ews  but als o 

Rom a, whic h the Nazis per petr ated as  
w
ell, but
 
als o pure of Serbs. 
 
 
Now, the Serbs are part
 
--
 
ther e ar e m ember s of what is  now Serbia but there were many 
Serbs  within Croatia. Ther e was  a m ixing of the soc iety. And they had basic ally c ome thr ough the years  
to live in c er tain parts  that under the Aus
tra
-
Hungar ian empir e. So their idea was  to get rid of the Ser bs . 
So the per s ec ution was not jus t of the J ews  but m ajorly of Ser bs .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So total ethnic  c leans ing.
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  Yeah.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Tell us what happened to your par ents and about your brother as  well.
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  So my par ents  were taken to this
 
--
 
bas ic ally to the jail, gathering plac e in Zagr eb. 
They had my little brother  with them who was  at that time I think about 9 months old by the tim e they 
were taken. I don't know why I r em em ber  that number.
 
Fortunately our hous ekeeper  went ther e. Things  
were s o c haotic. She ask ed if s he c ould have this  baby and they just s aid sure.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Tak e the baby.
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  Take the baby. So my parents handed the baby to her. And then s he c alled my 
unc le and m y aunt in Ludbr eg and they went and got him. I have a pr etty good m em or y of his  ar r ival. I 
r em em ber him being at m y gr andpar ents and lying on the bed and c rying and cr ying and c r ying. I have 
that m emory of this  crying baby and wonder ing what now.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And you were alr eady ther e.
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  I was  alr eady there.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Did you know if your  Aunt Giza or unc le had any idea what happened to your parents  
at that point?
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  Oh, I'm
 
s ure that everybody at that point had an idea what was  going on. A lot of 
people already had an idea. A lot of people s tarted 
f
leeing to the m ountains , not too high but to s tart 
fighting, m any young people.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  To bec ome partis ans ?
 
>> Dora Kl
ayman:  It was  the beginning of the par tis an m ovement, alm os t imm ediately. So this was  the 
other group. There was  this  fascist group that had p
ulled its elf together from  Italy and c ome to r un the 
plac e. At the s am e time, bas ic ally the Com munis t Party was  the prim ar y mover of s om e parts  of the 
par tis ans and then other people just s pontaneous ly went and joined bec aus e they didn't want to live 
under this  s ys tem .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So her e's  you and your  brother  now are with your aunt and unc le. In 1942 your  Unc l
e 
Ljudevit was  ar rested and s entenc ed to the J as enovac  c onc entr ation c amp and you and your br other

r em ained with your  Aunt Giza. Tell us  about your  unc le's  impr is onment at J as enovac  and then what 
happened.
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  By the tim e he was  arr ested, everybody els e was  already gone. So the first arres t 

was  everybody els e in the fam ily exc ept for him and his  wife. Ther e wer e some laws  by whic h he c ould 
s hield her  bec aus e it was  a m ixed marriage. But by that tim e everybody els e in the family, m y 
grandpar ent
s , m y other aunt, ever ybody, had already been arr ested. I c an go back  to that if you want 
m e to.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Pleas e do. Pleas e do.
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  I have a mem or y of their being arr es ted and es c orted.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You remem ber s eeing that?
 
>> Do
r a Klaym an:  I remem ber s eeing that. This was , of c ours e, a s ort of
 
--
 
it was  nighttime. I have 
m em or y of that. There was  ever ybody c ar rying pac kages . I r emember people c arr ying a pillow, a s m all 
s atc hel or  s om ething, and ever ybody s aying goodbye to me and
 
m y br other . I had no idea why lots  of 
people
 
--
 
why they were c rying and what was  going on but eventually they were gone and I was  left 
behind. I was  left behind with m y brother and at Ludva and Giza's  hous e. And the ques tion always  
c om es up how is  it the
y didn't take m e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Right.
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  I think, while I don't know for sure, m y thought is
 
--
 
you know, they had
 
--
 
the Ustas a 
were not as organized, by far, as  the Germ ans . However , they did follow certain things . For example, 
they had ever ybody regis ter ing. 
 
 
You s ay, 
W
ell, why would you go r egister ?  But, you know, the s ys tem was  s uc h that the 
polic e always  knew who was  living wher e. The J ewis h c ommunity had, of c our s e, a lis t of people.
 
My 
br other and I had c ome fr om another  town. So I have a s ens e that we were not on the infamous lis ts . 
So when thes e Ustas a who wer e leading the raid, c onduc ting the r aid, they would c om e and, you k now, 
take the lis t and take this, this , this , this and we were not on the lis t s o off they went and we w
er e 
s taying behind. 
 
 
That's the only thing I c an think of. Bec aus e ever ything had been lis ted way ahead of tim e. 
People had to r egister all of their wor ldly goods . They had to r egis ter  ever y little bit, you know, how 
m any necklac es you had. You had a little gold nec klac e or you had two pairs  of s hoes or a c oat
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Ever ything.
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  Everything was  r egis ter ed. And this  kind of r egistr ation is  actually on piec es
 
--
 
in 
form s , their forms . And som e of thos e for ms ar e here.
 
> > Bill 
Bens on:  Right. Right.
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  So by the time everybody left and we wer e left by ourselves, jus t Giza, Ludva and I 
and m y brother, life was  already ver y different. At that point, as you asked me, Ludva got arr es ted. And 
why?  Bec aus e by that point the partisan for c e had already bec ome a force and they were fighting the 
Nazis , fighting the Us tasa.
 
The loc al populous , whic h was  fortunately pr o partis an and anti
- Ustasa, 
whic h is  why I s uppos e als o we s ur vived, bec ause no one gave us  up
 
--
 
> > Bill B en
s on:  No one denounc ed you.
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  No. The entire town knew who we were. My gr andfather  was  a rabbi in that town for 
40 year s . Ever ybody knew who we were.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Ther e wer e no s ec rets.
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  But thes e people c am e from outs ide who led the r aids and we were left behind.
 
So at that point, however , m any people who wer e s ort of leaders in this c ity, in the town
 
--
 
I s houldn't 
c all it c ity at any point, a s m all town
 
--
 
a number of people wer e acc us ed by the Us tas a of helping the 
p
ar tis ans, whic h, of c ours e, they did but they were then arr es ted
 
--
 
they didn't admit to it but they wer e 
ar r ested as s uppor ters  of the partis ans . Therefore they wer e s ort of politic al pr is oner s. And politic al 

pr is oner s  were tr eated differently fr om J ews  or Ser bs  or  Roma in that they ac tually had s ome kind of a 
tr ial and they were given a s entenc e. So Ludva was  given a s entenc e. He was , fr om what I under s tand, 
in this  awful c amp of J asenovac  for  almos t a year .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So he had a defined s entence.
 

7 
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  He had a defined s entenc e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And that's  the s am e cam p your par ents were s ent to?
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  The same c amp. Mother was  in an auxiliary c am p. She already pas s ed away by 
that tim e I think . But m y father was  ac tually in the c am p of Jas enovac  and Unc le Ludva ac tually s aw 
him  ther e.
 
The s ituation in J as enovac  was  inc r edibly diffic ult.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You desc r ibed it as  an es pec ially  br utal
 
--
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  It was  a brutal, br utal c amp. Ther e ar e s om e attempts  at r evisions  s om etimes  to s ay 

it was  a work  c am p. Well, it was  a work  c am p to the death. It was  really a killing
 
c amp. People were 
killed in 
mos t brutal way
s  
and treated in the most br utal ways . It was  not organized ala people in 
Aus c hwitz where you had people s eparated and then they had ovens and s o on. People wer e jus t 
being killed brutally in any which way, s las hed with knives , hit with farm  implem ents. 
 
 
I'm told by som ebody who witnes s ed it that my grandfather  never even m ade it ins ide the 
c am p bec aus e he was  already elder ly and had s uffer ed a s mall str ok e and one of the offic ials  jus t took  

a hoe or s om ething like that, s om ething from a farm, farm im plem ent, and hit him on the head and that 
was  that. People wer e hanging all over  the plac e, just all the trees we
r e full, s c affolding. Then people 
were thr own into the r iver . The c am p is right near Sava River , the bigges t river in Croatia. There are 
pic tures and pic tures of bodies  floating on the river . It was  just an awful plac e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And your  unc le s aw 
your  father.
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  My unc le s aw m y father  who was  wor king ver y hard. He was , of c ours e, a m uc h 
younger  m an.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Right.
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  He remem bered that m y aunt was  15 year s  older than my m other and he was  10 
year s  older  than s he. He was  bor n in 1885. So he was  not a young m an. He had c om e from this fam ily 

wher e ever ybody had died. And m ost of them  of s om e ailment, s ome lung ailment. And he was  not s o 
well s o that he would never have s ur vived like my father if not for one thing a
nd that is  that different 
fr om  m y father who was  being m ade to c arry br icks an work very hard 
--
 
and wor k  very hard
. 
Unc le 
Ludva had, as I m entioned, been a banker . They needed s om ebody in an offic e. They put him in the 

office to r un their books.
 
> > Bill B
ens on:  In the c amp?
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  In the c am p. And that is what s aved his  life bec aus e he didn't have to wor k  outs ide 

in all kinds of weather. So this  is what helped him to s ur vive.
 
 
Als o, the other  thing is  that the Ustas a dec ided they wanted to have
 
s om e entertainm ent and 
they knew
 
--
 
they found out that he had been leading a c hoir and put on shows  as  an avoc ation and 
c ould play the violin. So they had him  organize a c hoir and an orc hes tra. So that gave them 
als o
 
--
 
people that he would c all to be in
 
this  c hoir
,  
it would give them a few hour s  of r espite fr om really, 
r eally hard wor k.
 
 
That's another  thing. Ther e was  almost no food. They wer e just
 
--
 
ther e ar e ac c ounts  her e in 
the m us eum that I trans lated wher e people wer e eating grass  if there was  gras s . That is  when they 
went out on som e kind of, you know
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on: Work  detail.
 
> > Dora Klaym an: Work  detail or s omething. It was  jus t r eally, r eally bad.
 
 
The pic ture that is  ther e of m y brother  and me with m y aunt, we s ent that
 
--
 
we wer e ac tu
ally 
allowed to s end him  packages. So we s ent this  pic ture. And one of the things that we us ed to s end as  
pac kages  was  a mixtur e of fat and then you put flour in it and you made a very, ver y thic k paste of that.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Of flour  and fat?
 
>> Dora K
layman:  Flour and fat. So it would be almos t like a bric k  m ade of flour  and fat. We were 
allowed to s end that. If he got it, whic h was  not always , he would take a little bit of that and you put it in 
this  water, whic h they gave you whic h was  c alled soup
, 
to make it a little mor e nutr itious.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  To give s ome c alories .
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  Yes.

> > Bill Bens on: While your unc le is going through all you jus t des cribed, in ear ly 1943 your  Aunt Giza, 
with whom you and your  br other wer e living, was  denounc ed and s he was  depor ted to Aus c hwitz. What 
happened to Giza? What do you remem ber of that?  And then, of c ours e, what happened to you and 
your  br other at that point?
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  I remem ber when they c ame to get her. I don't r emem ber s eeing any people. I jus t 
knew that there was  s ome em ergenc y happening. I r em em ber  her  going
 
--
 
we had a building next door 
to ours . It was  a building that two s is ters  and their hus bands  started building together. It was  s uppos ed 
to have
 Œ 
it
 
had
 
a stor e on the bottom and a little apar tm ent in the back  and unfinis hed apar tm ent 
ups tair s. They had not been finis hed at that point. She tried to get up there and hide but they found her. 

And on the way bac k s he told the fam ily that was  living in the s m all apartment in the
 
back , the Runjaks 
fam ily, s he asked them to take c ar e of us. They took  m y brother  and m e in.We started now pr etending 
that we were their c hildr en.
 
 
My aunt was  taken to Aus c hwitz. And when my unc le c ame back , he tr ied to follow the trail. 
He found out that s he had been taken to Aus c hwitz and there was  no way of s aving her. We r em ained 
with the Runjaks family until he r etur ned.
 
I always  knew, bec aus e I was  old enough at that point, that 
this  was  not m y m other.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Mr s .
 
Runjaks ?
 
> > Dora Klaym an
:  Mrs .
 
Runjaks . But I was  to c all her mother  when anybody was  pr es ent, anybody  we 
didn't know. But my br other, bec aus e he was  three years younger , he didn't even figur e that out. They 

were nic e to him so he jus t always  c alled her m other.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You wer e c ons c ious .
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  I was  c ons c ious  of what was  going on. I was  c ons c ious that it was  dangerous and 
that I needed to s ay that this  was  my m other, yeah.
 

> > Bill Bens on:  I think, if I understand c orrec tly, you only r ec ently learned with c ertainty what happened 
to Aunt Giza.
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  Right.When the arc hives  fr om Ger m any arr ived here
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  That's  within the last five or s o year s .
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  Yes, yes . Arr ived here. It's  now
 
--
 
all of thes e r ec ords that the German
s had m ade 
that wer e s tor ed have been digitized and ar e now available through the mus eum. We have it. It's  not 

eas y to ac c ess . You have to ask s omebody to do it. But for  people, if they have a name or s omething to 
go by, our res earchers  ar e very kind and will try and find that pers on. So they ac tually found m y 
aunt's

ther e is  a c ard that s ays  that s he c ame at s uc h and s uc h time and died at s uc h and s uc h time, 
very s hortly after s he arr ived, s uppos edly of intestinal ailm ents . Yeah.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So your unc le, bec aus e he had a defined s entenc e
 
--
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  He was  let go.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Sentence is  up.
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  And s o did ever ybody els e in Ludbr eg. Ther e wer e around four, five people arr es ted 
at the s ame tim e and were all let go.
 
>> Bi

c ouldn't. He was  too late.
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  Right.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So now it's Unc le Ljudevit and you.
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  And m y br other, yeah.
 
> > Bill B ens o
n: What happened then? 
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  Bas ically jus t we tried to s tay low and s urvive. It was  a very diffic ult tim e bec ause 

this  was  a time of battles between the Us tas a and the partis ans . The battles  wer e fought all ar ound us  
and in that town. We tri
ed at times  to hide befor e the battle. If we had any inkling that s om ething would 
be happening, whic h s om etimes  we did, we would run into our cellar . And the way to get to the c ellar is  
you had to get out of the hous e and then down.We had a vineyard nearby s o we had barrels  of wine 
that wer e kept there. It was  a low c eiling, dir t floor, dam p with tiny windows on the top and s helves  full 

of apples . Apples  had to be s eparated so the bus ines s  of one apple s poils  the r es t is  tr ue. So there 

9 
 
were apples , vegetables  kept in the winter time, c ar rots , r oot vegetables . There w
er e fr ogs jum ping 
ever y wher e. We had s ome kind of c ots down ther e. Sometim es you would s pend m any nights down 
ther e bec aus e the partis ans  would attack  dur ing the night. If they didn't win, they would try to withdraw.
 
 
Wher e Ludbreg is  s ituated, it's  just at the foot of hills  and then m ountains, not very high 
m ountains but it's mountains . So s ometim es we didn't get to es c ape into the c ellar  in tim e s o we would 
be ins ide the building, ins ide the hous e and bullets  would be flying thr ough the windows. You just would 

tr y to s it in the c orner. This  was a hous e that was  built by Ludva's  parents . So it was  very thic k  walls. 
So the bullets  did not penetr ate the walls  but they would penetr ate through windows
.  
> > Bill Bens on:  You told m e about an inc ident you r em em ber  with a very c los e c all with your uncle 

wher e a bullet s tr uck  wher e he just was .
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  Yes. It was  one of the battles  wher e one Us tas a for c e I think was  in our  backyard 
and the partisans  were on the s ec ond floor of the hous e ac r os s  the way and they wer e shooting at one 
another. Of c our s e we wer e in the middle. I was  still ly ing in my bed, whic h was  very well plac ed in a 
c or ner of one of the room s  so that it was  not near  a window. I was
 
c r ying. I c alled for  m y unc le who had 
c om e from the next bedroom  whic h did have a window that overlook ed the beds . So he c am e to 

c omfort m e and a bullet went s traight through the windows  r ight to wher e his  pillow was . So in a s ens e I 
s aved his  life ac c identally. Yeah.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You had s aid to m e
 
--
 
you're still a little gir l. The wors t part of that tim e for you was, 
quote, living through battles  and being afraid of being s hot r ather than of being depor ted bec aus e being 

s hot was  s o im m inent and real. You c ould gras p what that meant.
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  Right. Being depor ted meant nothing, just go away.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You disappear.
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  You dis appear. But being s hot was
 
--
 
bec aus e in the morning when we would get 
up, you wouldn't know what was  happening. Sometim es you'd peer out the little window in the 

bas em ent. I r em em ber  car ts going by, being pulled by hors es, full of dead bodies .
 
 
There was  one par tic ular time ther e was
 
a terr ible battle on our s treet that ended up with 
Us tasa s urr ounding the par tis an forc e and they couldn't esc ape and they thr ew a bom b among 
them s elves  and were killed. From then on that street was  c alled the one 
--
 
the 17th Br igade bec ause 
the 17th brigade peris hed ther e.
 
 
So that kind of thing
 
--
 
you know, I r em em ber  ver y well when the m ills  wer e bur nt. And the 
par tis ans burned the m ill because they wer e trying to get everything away fr om  the Ustas a, any kind of 
thing that they c ould s ustain thems elves  with. Of cour s e, this als o meant that people
 
--
 
ther e was  a mill 
on the s m all r iver we had there. This  was  in a r ur al ar ea. And all the people had brought their wheat to 
be m illed. The smell of it, the fir e of it was  jus t horrendous . I r emem ber that well, and all the people 
s c r eam ing and s houting and being very ups et. But that was  the kind of thing that was  going on back  
and for th with the partis ans  and the Ustas a.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And, of c ourse, the war  ended in May
 
1945. So Dora, with the war's  end, you'r e alone 
with your brother and Unc le Ljudevit.
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  Mm
-
hm m.
 
> > Bill Bens on: What did your unc le do then to try to build a life with his  niec e and nephew that he was  

now c ompletely in c harge of?
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  For one, we were waiting to se
e 
if anybody will retur n. No one was  c oming. People 
would as k  m e for m any years , after m any year s, certainly months and years afterwar ds , whether I'm 
s till hoping that my mother  or my father  would com e back
; m
aybe they are in s om eplac e in Russ ia. I 
don't k
now wher e people had this  idea.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Did you think  they were going to c om e back?
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  There's  always  s ome s ens e of that but I really los t hope fairly ear ly.
 
The only people 
that did r etur n wer e two of m y unc les
 o
n my father's s ide
. O
ne unc le was  ar rested. Well, both of 
them
 
--
 
one on m y mother's dec ide, one on m y father's  s ide wer e s erving in the Yugos lav Ar my when 
Germ any invaded. They were taken by the Germans  as pr is oner s of war. And they both s urvived, not 

10
 
 
together, s epar ately, as  pris oner s  of war. And they both r etur ned. They c ame to this  town of Ludbreg to 
s ee if anybody was  there of m y m other 's family. They only found me with Ludva.
 
 
B y 
that tim e, they wanted to have m e go with them. Both of them had m arr ied almost 
imm ediately
 
after the war . They were both headed
 
--
 
one of them mar ried. The other r em arr ied his  
wife
 
--
 
the one who is  in the pic ture with the s tar and the daughter wer e both killed. So he now m arr ied 
a widow with two c hildr en
, a
 
war widow. So they wer e all headed for Pales tine. It was  befor e Is r ael 
bec am e Isr ael. And they c ame to s ee m e and wanted m e to go with them.
 
By that time, I had 
als o
 
--
 
what we hadn't mentioned befor e, during the war  they baptized m e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  I was  hoping you m ight mention that.
 
>> 
Dora Klaym an:  Yeah. Ther e was  a 
time that Mrs.
 
Runjaks was  told by the pr ies t, what are we going 
to do with thes e c hildr en
; i
f not, s om ething would go with them, too. So they baptized m e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  In order to protect you.
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  In order  to protect me.Whether  that wor ked or not I don't know but I'm  alive, s o it 

m ight have worked.
 
 
So ther e was  this  pr oblem  that not only that but he als o immediately went ahead and adopted 
both my br other and m e offic ially. And s o here I was  now being torn between these two unc les  who 
r eturned and my unc le with whom I had spent this very diffic ult, very 
--
 
tim e, who was  extr em ely kind to 
m e, was  a wonderful, loving, exc eptional per s on. He loved me and I loved him. So when I was  asked 
by my unc les  to go with them, they es s entially as ked me what I wanted to do and I s aid I was n't going; I 
was  s taying with my Unc le Ludva.
 
> > Bill Bens on: What a tr emendous c hoic e for a young c hild.
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  It was  a c hoic e. By the way, by the tim e I made that choic e my brother was  no 
longer. In 1946 he c ontr ac ted sc ar let fever. It was  r ight after the war . We did not have penic illin. Three 

little boys in town c ame down with s c arlet fever. Two of them  s urvived. My br other did not. The doc tor s 
s aid he m us t have had a weak
 
heart. But he died within thr ee days  of c ontrac ting. 
 
 
So it was  a trem endous blow to m y unc le. He adored my br other . He ador ed us both. He had 
r eally no fam ily now. All of his  s iblings  wer e dead, his  wife. And s o it was  bas ic ally now
 
--
 
by 1947, 
1946 even, late 1946, it was  jus t he and I.We had s ometime
s m aids , s ometim es luc ky, hous ek
eeper s  
who were sor t of nannies. 
 
 
There was  one in partic ular  who had los t ever ything als o in the war. They had taken away her 
pens ion. She had been married
 
--
 
in the olden
 
days  to an Aus tra
-
Hungarian offic er. So when the 
Com munis t gover nm ent c am e about, that was  a no
-
no and they took  things away fr om them. 
Eventually it was  r eturned. But in the m eantime she c ame to be with us . She was  a highly educ ated 
lady who taught m e to
 
play the piano. She was  my fir st piano teacher, m y firs t Germ an language 
teac her.
 
Her fam ily, s he had a daughter
-
in
-
law who was  s till alive and a gr anddaughter. And they us ed 
to c om e to Ludbr eg often.We bec am e friends. And this  gr anddaughter I jus t vis ited while I was  in 
Ludbreg. So we kept the fr iends hip going.
 
 
But that is  bas ic ally how we lived after the war . It was  not an eas y tim e for anybody after the 
war.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And, of c ours e, you'r e under the Com munis t gover nm ent.
 

> > Dora Klaym an:  Righ
t.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And you would s tay living ther e with your  unc le until 1957. Tell us about leaving 
Yugoslavia and what you did.
 
> > Dora Klaym an: Well, in 1954 I went out the firs t time. An unc le who s ur vived
 c
ia Bergen
-
Bels en, 
es c aped to Hungar y, took the tr ain to Bergen
-
Bels en, ended up in Switzerland. They eventually wrote 
and found me. And in 1954 I was  allowed ac tually to go out to vis it him.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You have to explain why you were allowed to leave. You couldn't just leave a 
Com munis t c oun
tr y.
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  No. The Comm unis t c ountry, you c ouldn't go out at all. So I was  given a title of 

vic tim  of fas c ism . And as a vic tim  of fasc ism, I was  allowed to go out.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Temporar ily.
 

11
 
 
> > Dora Klaym an:  Tempor arily. I was  allowed to go
 
to vis it. I got a vis a. I got a pas s port and a vis a 
fr om  the Swis s  whic h took  s ome tim e als o. And I was  allowed to go. And, of c ours e, it was  als o 
expens ive. For tunately we s till had s ome things from  before the war  and so on. Of c our s e m y unc le was  
now, again, working as a bank dir ec tor  in town. So we had som ething still to s ell to buy a ticket for me. I 
was  allowed to take

Dora Klaym an:  Exac tly. So I got on this  tr ain all by m ys elf at the age of 16 and went to Switzerland. 
My unc le was  waiting for me at the bor der. They als o c ouldn't c ome. They had no c itizens hip at that 
tim e either. They were s tateles s . So for the first t
im e I s aw s om eone fr om  m y family. 
 
 
It was  a very emotional m oment. We went to his  hous e to his  apartment. His  wife was  there, 
very lovely, als o from Zagreb. They had s ur vived the war together . They had two little c hildren. It was  a 

wonder ful r eunion.
 
They
 
were very kind, very lovely. We got along very well, right away. But what's  
interes ting is  that they were r eligious , Orthodox Jews , and I knew abs olutely nothing

I knew I was 
J ewis h. I always  knew who I was . I always  knew who m y gr andparents wer e and so on. But I never 
knew anything about J udais m . For one, dur ing the per iod of Com munist r ule, nobody knew anything 
about any r eligion. I m ean, we c ertainly

nobody went to c hurc h. Nobody went to s ynagogue. There 
were no s ynagogues. The s ynagogue in Ludbr eg was totally des troyed down to nothing. They kept 

hor s es  in ther e dur ing the war. And then it was  totally leveled. There's nothing ther e now either .

> > Dora Klaym an:  No, to this  day.
 
 
So it was  an em otional tim e in Switzerland. But we got along ver y well. So after a month I 
went bac k . They said, well, why not c ome back  onc e I finis h high s c hool and I'm at the univer s ity. So I 

did. I managed to get

I finis hed high sc hool. It was  a wonderful high school I just c am e back fr om
 
a 
60th reunion. It was  a ver y s m all ac adem ic  high school. I was  s tudied Englis h. Really loved it. So I 
s pent a year at the Univer s ity of Zagreb as  an Englis h major. And then after that year  I went to 
Switzer land onc e again to m y aunt and unc le with the idea of studying Fr enc h at the Univers ity of 
Laus anne.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  I think we'r e going to stop there. I wis h that we had m ore time. I think  you c an tell that 
we really had to jump over an awful lot.We c ould have kept you all her e this  afternoon and you
 
m ight 
have liked it. I know I would have.
 
 
It's  our  tr adition at
 
First Per son

bac k  to Dor a in a mom ent and have Dora c los e the program.

Dor a will r em ain up on the s tage her e. We invite you to c ome up on stageand s ay hi to her, ask  her  a 
question, take your  pic tur e with her, whatever  you would like to do. We'd like you to do that if you'd like

One of the things  I regr et not having tim e to get to is , and this  m ight em barr as s  Dor a, but how

I jus t c am

ther e are friends , people I know, and not being at home bec aus e the United States  has really bec ome 
my home. I've

It's  distur bing s ometim es to s ee how things are not im proving in the way that I would like to 
s ee them  im pr ove. Instead of people being awar e of how terr ible it is  when there are war s  and 
animos it
ies  and s ingling out groups  of people to dec ide that there s houldn't be here or  they s houldn't be 
wher e they want to be or expr es s  what they want to expr es s or pr actic e r eligion they want to prac tice. 

It's  very diffic ult for me to s ee that bec aus e of m y exper ienc e and knowing how hur tful and how us eles s  
s uc h behavior is .
 
 
So both in Eur ope and the United States now I find la
nguage that I find
 
hurtful and ups etting. 
And in Europe it's s ometim es  as  if they have forgotten what they went through. And her e I thi
nk  we 
s hould als o rem em ber the language we us e, the sentiments  we expres s  that might be hurtful to other s.
 
This  is w
hat I'm leaving ever yone with: toleranc e, sens e of the im por tance of human s pir it, and goodwill 
to all m en.
 
 
Thank  you for being her e.
