FRED DEUTSCH 
August 18, 1995 
 
Question Would you begin by stating your name , 
date of birth and where you were born? 
Answer Yes.  My name  is Fred Deutsch.  
I was born in Czechoslovakia in a town name d 
_______________, which is not far away from the Polish border.  I was born on November 13, 
1932.  That was about one year be
fore Hitler came to power .  The town I spent my childhood in 
as far as I can reme mber, was a large industrial to
wn which had big steel mills and coal mi nes.  
My father was a dentist.  A very well to do dent
ist.  I have a sister.  We  grew up in a large 
apartment in the center of the 
town.  The first event that I remember from my childhood was 
when my fat her took me  to a movie to see S
now White and Seven Dwarfs.  Other significant 
event comes to mi nd that when we walked th
rough the town, the town
 was full of me n who 
exercised civil readiness against air attacks.  C
onsequently, each me mber  
of my fa mily received 
a gas ma sk and we had to exercise how to put it 
on and off.  In my early childhood I contracted a 
mi ddle ear infection, and consequently, I was more in hospitals than at home .  One has to 

reme mber that penicillin was not 
invented as yet and therefore infe
ctions, they were very serious 
illnesses in those days.  Because of my ear infec
tion, I was unable to atte
nd regularly school.  At 
any rate, in 1938 I would have been going only 
to the first grade a
nyhow, and between my 
hospital visits, I had a private tuto
r who taught me  how to write and 
read.  At that time of course, 
I was a very little boy.  I do not re
me mber or did not know the reasons for our move, but in about 
1938 or 1939 we moved away from _______________ to a town called ______________, which 

was more inland of the republic and further away
 from the Polish border.  Looking at the move 
in retrospect today, I know 
that the region of _______________ was considered part of the 
_______________ and it was not quite certain whether 
it will not revert to Poland and taken 
away from the Czech republic.  So, we 
moved to a town called ________________ which was a 
place of birth of my father.  It
 was a pleasant, nice little to
wn with a population of about 10,000 
people as opposed to 50,000 or 60,000 of 
________________.  So, it was a move to a much 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0274  
2 
 
smaller town, but it was pleasant, quiet.  It ha
d a district and I reme mb
er every Thursday or 
Friday, peasants used to come  to the town to se
t a ma rket with their pr
oduce and life we nt on in a 
very pleasant  leisurely pace. 
Q. Before you go any further, let me  ask you a couple questions.  When in _____________ 

you were all given gas ma sks and taught about 
the civil preparedness, 
what was this for? 
A. At that time, in everybody's mi nd wa s one 
thing that reme mb ering that the Germans in 
first World War used gas and everybody assume d th
at should an air attack ma terialize, the 
enemy will revert to gas. 

Q. So there was already an awareness or 
concern about what was going on in Germany?  
A. Yes.  Now, looking in retrospect, it's eas
y to be a Monday mo rni
ng quarterback, but in 
those days I didn't know about 
it, but Germany threatened that if Czechoslovakia doesn't  
surrender they simply will come with airp
lanes and bomb Cz echoslovakia and everybody 
assume d that these would be gas attacks.  For 
reasons obvious today but not known at that time, 
ma ny peopl e especially Jewish population of the Czech
 part of the republic, the ma jority of Jews 
spoke German where the Slovak part of Czechos
lovakia, there the Jews spoke Hungarian and 
Europe being a relatively small continent, the 
radio at that time  wa
s the main media of 
communication.  Many people who wanted to know wh
at goes on in the world listened to foreign 
broadcast.  It was very easy and very simple to
 catch radio from Berlin 
or Vienna and get their 
point of view across.  Because the Czech newspape
rs unfortunately always tried to mi nimi ze the 
threat that is actually hanging over the count
ry and one act of appe
asement took place after 
another.  The Czech government always hoped that this action will finally satisfy the German 

demands and that nothing more serious will come out of it. 

Q. Do you remember your fa mily listening to th
e radio or your parent
s talking about what 
was going on? 

A. No.  My parents didn't speak in front of 
the children about these 
things.  That was the 
custom of those days that you send the children 
to bed before you started speaking of serious 

events.  Some thing else come s back
 to my mi nd that friends of my
 parents, many of them started 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0274

to disappear.  Later on, when I began to ask what 
happened to such and such, I was told that they 
left Czechoslovakia and settled in
 foreign countries.  Name ly, I th
ink that there were people who 
saw what was comi ng and took steps while time  was 
still available.  I re
me mber specifically two 
fa milies that immi grated to Palestine.  At that time the st ate of Israel  didn't exist.  They 
immi grated to Palestine.  A couple of people em
i grated to England.  Some of them went to 
Egypt.  Now, why some  people were guessing corr
ectly, I don't know.  My father, unfortunately 
was not one of those that guessed correctly.  He 
always thought that what
ever exists is only a 
temporary situation and it will pa ss away, and ther efore, we stayed. 

Q. Was your family religious? 

A. No.  That is another intere
sting situation.  The Czech inte
lligencia if I may call it that 
way, was not religious , including the Jews.  It used
 to be said that the higher education you will 
obtain, the less religious you are.
  And my father, being a 
me dical doctor, under Austro-
Hungarian monarchy you first had to be a me dical
 doctor before you were permitted to specialize 
in dentistry.  So, we were 
not religious.  When we di
d move away from _______________ to 
________________, we used to attend a synagogue but attendance usually was not done for 

religious purposes.  It was more done  for soci
al gathering.  That's where you me t your friends 
and your acquaintances. 

Q. Did you mi x with Christian kids?   
Did you parents have Christian friends? 
A. I do not reme mber specifically Christian 
friends, except we did have a ma id and my 
father had an apprentice who learned the tec
hnical side of dentistry.  Otherwise, I do not 
reme mber comi ng into contact with Christians. 
 However, you know, I was six or seven years of 
age and religion in those days didn't me an anything at
 all to me .  I used to go part time  to school, 
but whether my fellow students we
re Jewish or Christians, I si
mply don't  know, but I don't think 
I would have cared. 

Q. You don't reme mber other kids comi ng up to you and calling you a Jew? 

A. No, no in those days prior to the war, no.  
Simpl y I think I was too well shielded because 
of the frequent illnesses.  The ear infections, ha
ving a ma id who took me  to park for a walk.  I do 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0274  
4 
 
not reme mb er, with exception of
 one of my father's friends 
who had a daughter my age.  
Occasionally she and I me t and we played toge ther
, but ot herwise I don't reme mber in those days 
having any friends.  But, you know that was pr
obably childhood stuff, typical childhood for 
those days.  I do not think Judaism had much to do 
with it.  It was probably more because of my 
frequent ear infections that in
fluenced that kind of sheltered life than having grown up in a 
mi ddle class family. 

Q. You moved to ________________ in what year? 

A. That must have been in 1939, I thin
k.  The move itself I do not reme mb er. 
Q. Do you think this was before the Germans annexed the Czech republic? 

A. I honestly do not know.  That seems to me , but
 that is looking in retrospect, I think the 
Germans annexed Czechoslova
kia March 15, 1938, I think. 
Q. 1939. 

A. Okay, '39, but whether we moved before or 
after, I do not reme mber.  My next me mory 
of ________________ is I reme mber sitting in either 
the first or second grade elementary school 
and going there for ma ybe a half of year when a
ll of a sudden I had to stop going.  I was then 
told that as a Jew no longer can
 I attend this school.  How s
oon thereafter the belt started 
tightening up, I cannot give you in te
rms of dates.  I only remember 
more or less events.  All of a 
sudden it usually I was told either by my father
 or by my mother that for example I cannot go 
through certain streets with the ex
ception of between the hours of th
ree and five in the afternoon.  
Many stores in ______________ suddenly had a sign to Je
ws  entry is forbidden.  Other stores 
permitted visit from Jews between the hours of three and five.  I knew I cannot leave the 

boundaries of the town.  I knew I cannot go to a m
ovie or a soccer game or to a public place.  I 
can not go to a municipal swimmi ng pool.  I cannot
 go skiing because that would mean to go out 
of town.  There was a whole host of things wh
ich were forbidden.  Then as a next step I 
reme mber each Jew had to wear a star of David.  
A yellow star that had to be affixed over one's  
heart.  That  star al ways had to be made visi
ble.  You were not permitted to cover it up with 
anything.  Jews were given special i.d. cards 
which had to be produced whenever policeman 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0274  
5 
 
stopped you and asked for it.  Because even 
in the Czech republic, every citizen of 
Czechoslovakia has an i.d. card but Jews had a sp
ecial i.d. card.  Not having an i.d. card was 
punishable under any Czech law.  Jews were issu
ed ration cards which were much s ma ller than 
those of the Christian population.  Events took 
pl ace and I don't know in what order exactly it 
followed.  We were, by we I mean J e ws were reque
sted or ordered to surrender came r as, radios.  
We had to surrender any passports if you had any. 
 We  had to dismount any brass objects from 
the apar tment.  Jews were not permitted to have 
any pets.  The explanat ion for that was that the 
pets were slaughtered by Germans a nd that greas
e or fat was used to lubricate machinery.  All 
the towns, including _____________, lost their church 
bells.  The paradox is that thanks to 
German occ upation, Czechoslovaki
a acquired electricity of 220 volts instead of 110 which they 
used to have under the old republic.  The reason fo
r it is that the 110 volts were sent via copper 
wires and copper offers low resistance to electri
city, but copper was needed very badly by the 
nazi machinery and all the wiring, copper wi
ring was replaced by lower conductivity wires 
which provided greater resistance to
 electric current, so therefore,
 they had to raise the voltage 
from 110 to 220.  How beneficial it is, I 
don't know, but that was one benefit.   
Q. What did a boy of eight 
years old, seven years old, do you reme mber how you felt about 
all of these restri ctions?  Did it ma
ke sense to you?   Did it bother you? 
A. I'm not quite certain whether it did bother me  or not, because you have to keep in mi nd 

one that, that European societies especially 
those who used to be under Austria-Hungarian 
monarchy are very obedient people.  They have mu
ch greater respect, always had much greater 
respect for authority than here, in a free soci
ety.  In the old republic
 everybody had in his 
possession hundreds of documents.  It was a societ
y obsessed with documents.  It's difficult to 
explain the futility of these documents because
 it's so laughabl e, but the bureaucracy was 
unbelievable.  Therefore, when an order came,
 even if a foolish one, nobody asked whether it 
ma kes sense or not.  The only unpleasant situa
tions began to devel
op, but again, gradually, 
where came an order that Jews are forbidden to
 communicate with non Jews.  That started to 
create problems.  Now, I do not kno
w what the Christian boys were 
told by their parents, but I do 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0274  
6 
 
reme mber that when I walked through certain st
reets that boys my age and older ones, ganged up 
on me  and used to beat me  up and c a lling me  not 
only Jew, that would have been too simple, but 
they were infected by their parent
s.  At that time, they used to
 call Jew, Christ killer, and by 
beating me  up they believed that they are revenging the crucification of 
Christ that some how I 
am responsible for it.  That is one part of it 
which I never could have 
reconciled in my mi nd.  
How am I, if it is true that  the Jews sold out Christ
 and crucified him, what part did I play in it, or 
my parents.  Why a m I being punished for so
me thing 1,945 years later.  When I came to my 
parents with these questions, there we re no answers.
  Simply, I do reme mber that certain things I 
asked once and then I did not get satisfactory answ
er or answer that I could have at that age 
comprehend, I didn't pursue it anymore.  Because 
usually my parents' answer was when you are 
older you will understand better.  Now you are st
ill too young to understand.  That is what I 
reconciled myself with.  Perhaps when I will 
be older I will understand, 
so therefore, I didn't 
pursue ma ny of these open questions.  
Q. When you said that you generally accepted wh
atever rules we re establishe d because that 
was the way life was, still ma ybe I would quest
ion why these rules only
 applied to Jewish 
people? 

A. Again, I do not have a clear cut answer because
 I'm not quite certain th
at at that age I was 
concerned with us Jews.  I think I was more c
oncerned with myself, why I cannot do some thing.  
I'm not quite certain I understood that there ar
e others in town that suffer with the same 
restriction. 

Q. Right, but what I'm suggesting is you c
ouldn't do some thing but the boy next door could. 

A. Yes, I was told simply because he wa s a Ch
ristian and that was the rule.  I didn't ask why 
he and I not.  I was told because you are Jewish 
and the rules said you as a Jew could not do that. 
Q. At the time  of all of thes
e restrictions were you still able
 to go to the synagogue like you 
had been doing? 

A. That come s the next step.  Again, I do not
 know if it was 1941, certain
 things started to 
develop slowly.  First of all, _________________ was a 
town which had a large Jewish section.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0274  
7 
 
It was called _______________, Jewish town.  All of a sudde
n, I began to realize 
that that part of 
_________________, the population of that part, begins to
 increase in size.  Na me ly, because I 
as a Jew was not permitted to associate with Chris
tians, I used to go every day to the Jewish part 
of the town to play with boys my age .  Not all 
the streets were closed to
 Jews or entry permitted 
from three to five, only the ma in streets.  If I 
went  in circles, I was always able to reach the 
Jewish part of town and play w ith the Jewish boys.  That part
 of the town, the population began 
to swell.  Everyday there were more and more 
people in that part of town.  I was delighted 
because there were more boys to play with.  It never occurred to me  to ask why does the 
population of that part of town keep increasing. 
 It simply didn't signal anything unique.  The 
house which we occupied which we 
owned, also got additional tenant
s, so that finally we were 
squeezed into one room.  We  shared the house 
with people from other towns throughout the 
region who all were sent to _______________ to the Je
wish, and slowly it became  a ghetto.  
Now, I do not reme mber any specifi c events except that  Germans did not have any military 

contingent in _______________- that resided there. 
 The nearest gestapo contingent was in 
________________, which was a larger town that ________________.  The Czech police pl ayed 

some a mbivalent role in the whole situation.  
Some Czech policemen re ma ined faithful to the 
fact that they were policemen and not nazis.  Ot
hers saw an opportunity to enrich themselves and 
joined the side of the Germans against the Je
ws.  So, it depended on your sin and who actually 
accused you of it whether you went free or not. 
 The Gestapo came many a times and arrested 
people without any specific reason.  Usually see 
bits of news you learne
d through the grapevine 
that such and such was taken away yesterday 
by the gestapo.  Usually you never saw that person 
again or that fa mily again.  So, the Jewish part 
of town began really to explode in seams from 
influx of people, of the Jews. 

Q. Your house was not in that area? 

A. Our house was just on the border of the Je
wish part of the town but not in it. 
Q. So, when you wanted to go there to play w
ith boys your age, did you feel safe?   Did you 
parents show any concern about you wandering around? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0274  
8 
 
A. No, not as long as they knew I was in that
 part of town.  The only worry was that every 
Jew had to be off the street at 8:00 and if 
you were caught after 8:00 
that wa s reason to be 
deported.  But as long as I was home before 8:00 
there was no particular worry.  At least my 
parents never indicated to me  that they were 
worried what I'm doing all 
day.  They knew where I 
was.  The only problem was not to commit some
 mi schief, for example, not to go fishing. 
_____________ had a very pleasant river, plenty of fi
sh, and that again was taboo.  So, it was a 
tense situation, but I think that at
 that age, ma ybe you are looking at
 these things as more of an 
adventure rather than sensing the 
danger in it.  Because after a
ll, don't forget that the Germans 
atrocities that they committed, were all committ
ed elsewhere until you actually got there, you 
didn't have the slightest knowledge of what is ha
ppening.  We didn't have radio.  The news came  
only through grapevine.  The news was sanitized. 
 In those early days of the second world war, 
things went extremely well for the German
s.  They conquered France without too ma ny 
problems.  They conquered Poland.  They were ve
ry close deep into Russia.  The news that 
people were listening to, let's say the broadcasts
 from London or from Moscow were not very 
encouraging in those days.  I ma y add one addi
tional thing that in t
hose days every radio 
throughout _______________ or even under the Czech republic
 was registered in the post office.  
You had to renew your radio licen
se every year by buying a stamp. 
 So, that the authorities knew 
of every radio, who owns  it, and where it is.  One 
of the first things the Germans did when they 
occupied Czechoslovakia they remo ved the tubes 
from the radio.  In those days they had huge 
vacuum tubes that enable you to listen to London or Moscow.  That me ans short waves or long 

waves.  We  are not talking about am or fm.  In 
those days, they had different waves in Europe, so 
you were left  with a radio that was only able to
 let you listen to Centra
l Europe radio stations, 
and Central Europe in those days almost compl e
tely occupied by the Germans.  So, you always 
heard one and the same  newscast and the Germans we
re singing praises to th
e victor ious armi es.  
So, situation did not look very rosy at all.  As a 
ma tter of fact, one sort of a habit we used to have 
is we used to have a ma p of Europe and we used to tuck pins which town was conquered by the 

Germans so we had more or less create a pict
ure how far the German ar mies had advanced.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0274

Then you had another problem, you did not know ex
actly what was propaganda and what is 
reality. 
Q. How much of what you're talking about were
 you aware of or did you even think about at 
that age? 

A. Well, again, as I said at that age you l
ook upon any military as some thing that you want 
to become  part of when you grow up and ________________ being a small town, occasionally a 

military convoy passed through and I reme mber I don't know exactly why one day came and 

contingent of Ger man soldiers that were outfitte
d in African clothes they
 were the Africa  corp 
that fought under ______________, and st
rangely enough shortly thereafte
r after that contingent 
passed through town, the whole ____________________ bloc
k was required to surrender leather 
ma de luggage, pieces of luggage and leather ma de 
goods.  We were told that that is needed to 

ma nufacture for the Africa corp shoes.  They need
 a lot of shoes.  We  were then asking well 
what suppose the rest of the population to do?   Fo
r example, if your shoe soles were worn out.  
So, then some body introduced old tires from cars and used that rubber for shoe soles.  As the 

next item, old tires had to be surrendered.  Pe
ople who used to have bicycles became  very 

inventive.  After surrendering the tires from the 
bicycles they mounted on a wire in very close 

proximity to each other, corks from bottles 
and ride the bicycle on corks.  Gasoline was 

unobtainable because private cars were either confiscat
ed or  not permitted to be driven at all, and 
the buses were converted I do not know exactly 
how it worked mechanically but each bus had a 
boiler mounted on the side and I 
think it was propelled by steam.
  You ha d to create steam 
pressure in the boiler and then you 
were able to ride in it.  Of 
course when the pressure went 
down, everybody had to go out.  If the bus driver ha
d some  wood with him, then he again fired 
up the boiler.  If not everybody had to go and gather
 pieces of wood and again simulate the steam 
pressure of the boiler before the bus was able to
 continue.  These are some  me mories and bits 
and pieces that you heard through the grapevine about economi c conditions and situations. 

Q. You weren't  riding on the busses? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0274  
10 
 
A. Later on I had the opportunity.  Later on in th
e war I had the opportunity
 to ride on one of 
those busses and experience it first hand, but that was after we fled.   
Q. So, were you and your family ever forced to live within this ________________? 

A. No.  I do not think that because it wa
s so close to the ______________ that we were 
actually in a way considered part
 of it.  Maybe geographically not, but the distance wa s ma ybe a 
hundred yards to the _______________.  The only difference being was that the 

________________ at some  point it had about four entr
ies to it and there were guards posted 
there, and I think a gate was er
ected and anybody that went in or 
out had to show his i.d. card, 
but because  we were outside of it, we  didn't have
 to do so.  So, if that is considered some  

privilege, I don't know. 

Q. Who were the guards, do you know?   We re they Jewish guards? 

A. Yes, they were Jewish guards. 

Q. So, did your general living c
onditions become  more difficult 
in terms of was your father 
still able to practice dentistry? 

A. No, no, father didn't practice.  I think that we lived from our savings.  The food rations 

well, if you saw that, they were 
mi nuscule.  Even that which y
ou obtained on the ration cards had 
a very dubious quality.  For example, I do reme mb
er that we got periodi cally a cube of honey 
and I don't know why I still reme mber it, I was told
 that the honey was ma de from coal.  I do not 
know che mistry.  I heard it was ma de from coal.  I do not know whether you have seen a book of 

coupons, but every week we were entitled to so
me thing. Let's say one week you were scheduled 
to obtain ma rmalade.  Glass was not available, 
so you went to a grocer
y store and they put a 
piece of wax paper and weighed in to it ma r malade.  By the time  you came home, not much was  

left.  It all seeped out.  Potato
es I think were our ma in staple. 
 Bread which we got, was black in 
color.  As a ma tter of fac t , some body ma de for 
me a friend a chess set from that black bread 
because that bread if you didn't consume it within
 a few hours, was hard like rock.  I don't know 
what that bread was ma de of.  One by product 
of the economi c shortage was that the black 
ma rket flourished in an unbelieva
ble fashion.  Unfortunately in 
every time  of adversity, black 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0274  
11 
 
ma rket flourishes and ma ny people enrich thems e
lves by being black ma rketeers.  There was 
black ma rket for gasoline .  There was black ma rk
et for cigarettes.  Again, cigarettes were not 
available for Jews.  I and a friend of mi ne beca me a little inventive.  We  wanted to make some  
extra money.  In as muc h as cigarettes to Je
ws, however, what was available were filters, 
cigarette filters, and we used to
 buy in a stor e a hundred empty ciga
rette filters and used to utilize 
dried leaves and stuff that instead of tobacco a
nd we were selling it.  So, we  ma de a little bit 
extra money by selling these awful smelling and tast
ing cigarettes.  We  were very inventive for 
example I reme mber my father used to have a fish
ing rod so we  mounted on the tip of the fishing 
rod a sack ma de of linen and we used to extend 
that fishing rod to a ga
rden which my neighbor 
grew apples and we used to steal apples from
 his trees with a fishi
ng rod.  There are childhood 
me mories and it's interesting th
at poverty and hunger and need can be stimulate within you 
creativity and inventiveness 
and I think that's what ma de it in a wa
y fun for us kids at that age.   
Q. Your father, he wa
s not working any more? 
A. No, he was not working. 

Q. So, how did your parents spend their time? 

A. I think that the Jewish men of the 
_____________ of the Jewish section used to spend 
most of their day playing cards and exchangi
ng stories and trying to 
outguess the political 
situation and trying to guess when the war w
ill end.  That was the ma in occupation.  That 
situation sort of a limbo if you w
ill I think lasted for about a year, year and a half.  Then the 
situation began to change very, very rapidly and 
very dramatically.  By that I mean the order 
came that in alphabetical order by the last name
 e ach Jew has to come  to local high school a 
register.  There you obtained a number, a registra
tion number which gain didn't mean very much 
to me .  With the registration number, you were given 
a list and that list stat
ed that the registration 
number will be your personal i.d. from here on 
and you should prepare for the relocation to the 

east.  In or de r to provide supplies for the relo
cation you were permitted to take with you no more 
than 50 kilograms per person, 50 kilograms being 
about 80 pounds and it specified exactly what 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0274  
12 
 
you were not permitted to take with you.  It left
 the relocation date open, but you should slowly 
get ready for it. 
Q. What were you not allowed to take with you? 

A. Well, again the Germans itemi zed the list fo
r forbidden items that they took away from 
you a long time ago, but they wanted to ma ke sure that some how you didn't  forget to surrender 

these ar ticles.  You were not permitted to take 
any gold, any jewels, radi os, came ras, items which 
nobody had anymore anyhow.  Now, a strange ga
me  started to develop.  Everybody through 

grapevines started asking well wh
at do we take with us.  East
, we are going east.  Nobody knew 
just how far or where to or what 
time  of year would it be.  Do we
 take winter articles.  Do we 
take food with us.  What exactly do we take.  
There the grapevine star
ted working.  We  still 
didn't know where we would go, but
 everybody was advised to take 
food.  Now, with the ration 
coupons again the question was well what food do we 
take, how much.  After all, the food is of 
so dubious quality it mi ght spoil.  I do reme mber 
that my mot her used to prepare huge cubes of 
yeast.  I never tried to analyze why yeast but 
maybe it has some unique nu
tritional value.  We 
used to accumulate cubes with honey.  I do reme
mber that we  purchased cubes of toothpaste and 
open the cubes in the back and stuffed into thetoothpaste gold coins whic
h we still had because 
nobody surrendered everything.  So, in that way, we 
started preparing for a 
journey that we didn't 
know when would take place or  where to. 

Q. Let me  ask you a couple questions and then 
we'll change tapes.  Approxima tely what 
time period are we talking about? 

A. That was about '41 or '4 2. 

Q. When you got this information about going 
to the high school and getting a number and 
what you would take, did this come  through some
 sort of Jewi sh representatives of the 
community or how did you get this infor mation? 

A. In retrospect in general I can ma ke that st
atement.  Everything that the community, that 
the authorities wanted the community to know, us
ually came via two systems of me di a.  One was 
through loudspeakers which I think the Germans 
had mounte d almost on every corner of the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0274  
13 
 
main street.  Then number two they had public
 bill boards on which they posted the huge 
placards and always writing and adding to whom
 it concerns and not 
reading the placards, 
advertisement was no excuse for not obeying the 
law was again punishable because every citizen 
was forced to listen to the loudspeakers 
or read it on the public bulletin boards.

Q. So, when we stopped we  were talki
ng about the registration and relocation. 
A. Now, at home we did all sorts of exercise
.  The problem wa s that
 in as much as the 
leather luggage was taken away, we had paper 
type of luggage and the problem was how ma ny 
pounds the paper luggage can handle.  Then the 
question was do we carry it in two pieces of 
luggage or do we take a sack or where do we put 
what.  But, I have to deviate a little bit from 
that to tell you a very important  
side of the story, name ly now co
mes seeing my grandfather.  My 
grandfather was a me dical doctor who at that time
 was living on the Slovak side of the border.  
Before the war, he used to be a 
me dical doctor in a glass factory 
that was situat ed exactly in the 
mi ddle of the international bor
der between Czech lands and Sl
ovak lands.  The factory was a 
glass kind of factory owned by Germans.  When
 Hitler came to town, the Germans sold the 

factory and fled to Germany, and when that ha ppened, my gr andfather lost the pl ace as a 

physician for the glass blowers and moved from th
at village to a town on the Slovak side called 
________________ where he opened a private practice.  All 
the glass blowers that used to live in 
the village of whom he took care rema ined hi
s patient and used to come  visit him for  
consultations to _______________.  When the _____________ emerged the Slovak part of 

Czechoslovakia became independent and became a puppet state under a president who was a 

priest.  ______________ was his name .  He was  a cat
holic priest.  The Slovaks traditionally 
didn't like very much the union with the Czechs.
  The Czechs probably didn't like the Slovaks 
much either.  They viewed the Slovaks like a 
bride who didn't bring into the ma rriage a dowry 
large enough, and therefore, the 
marriage was a very uneasy one.  
Furthermore, the Slovaks were 
always fiercely nationalists and the Slovak population was very clearly divided between the 

catholic population and the Lutheran population. 
 So, Slovaks had a very small mi nority of 
gypsies but they didn't amount to mu ch.  But when
ever later on we wanted to know whether a 
person is reliable suffi ciently we 
always ask as a first question wh
ether he's  a catholic or whether 
he's a Lutheran but that came a little bit later.
  However, the Slovak part  of the land was not 
occupied initially by Germans and the economy in
 Slovakia was flourishi
ng.  It was extremely 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0274  
15 
 
good going as compared to the _____________ side of 
the country.  My grandfather was always 
able to smuggle goods, food stuff, to us.  
Na me ly, the international board of _____________ in 
Slovakia who went exactly through the mi ddle of
 the village and the population from one 
country worked in the second country so that 
the German gua rds after a while already knew the 
people by sight and didn't  ask anymore for i.d. ca
rds and as long as you we
re dressed according 
to the local customs and habits and didn't beha
ve in any conspicuous fashions the Germans 
usually didn't bother to stop you for an i.d. card.  At
 least not during the regul
ar day hours.  They 
let the people cross the borders without any prob
lems .  And consequently, ma ny of these farmers 
used to come  to ______________, which was not very
 far away from the border and brought us 
me ssages fr om Grandfather and brought smuggled f
ood stuff.  So, we were always a little bit 
better off than the other people who didn't have a
ny contacts.  The messages that my grandfather 
sent us usually were written on a piece of linen andsewed in a lining of a coat so that even if the 

Germans frisk you they wouldn't fee l  paper.  My
 grandfather had his sources of information 
because the Slovaks were able to listen to radi
os easier in a freer form than we and he knew 

about these transports and where they are going.  S
o, he kept warning us, al
erting us, but at that 
time he did not indicate anything ab
out being in a position to help 
us.  So, after registration about 
a couple weeks later, suddenly again on these bill
boards came  an announcement that registration 
numbers of between these and these numbers shoul
d report to the local railroad station on such 
and such date.  Luckily enough, one farmer came 
on that day and brought us food stuff from our 
grandfather and on his way back to Sl ovakia we
 gave him a message 
that we have been 
scheduled for transport two week
s from today and this is goodbye.  The farmer as we know 
today, succeeded and gave that me ssage to our gra
ndfather.  About three or
 four days before we 
were to appear at the railroad station I was playing w
ith the boys in the ______________ as 
usually.  Suddenly my s i ster came to fetch me and said quietly, go quickly to grandma, my 

grandmother from my father's side, the grandfat
her that was living in Slovakia was from my 
mother's side.  This grandmother was from 
my father's side. 
She lived in the _______________, 
go say goodbye to her and I will take  you imme diat
ely home.  Don't ask any questions.  So, I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0274  
16 
 
went to grandma and said goodbye to her.  She appa
rently knew already and 
she started to cry.  I 
didn't understand the reason for her crying, I said bye
 grandma and I left with my sister.  That 
was late in the afternoon.  When I came home, ther
e I realized the flurry of activity.  My mother 
was taking all sorts of clothes and bringing it 
to neighbors who lived across from our  house.  I 
reme mber the neighbor being a tailor and my mo
ther always brought it over and came  back 
empty handed and took another lo
ad and brought it again to the neighbors.  I asked my mother 
what's going on.  She said don't ask any questions, just get dressed very wa rmly.  Take two 
layers of clothes and don't  ask any questions.  I di
dn't ask any questions.  It was winter.  I think it 
must have been Christmas day, probably 1942, 1
943 Christma s.  At about 8:00 my father, my 
mother, and my sister and myself
 gathered.  We  shut off the lights which was sort of a useless 
exercise anyhow because I should me ntion that in
 those days all the windows had to have heavy 
curtains because of air attacks.  We  waited 
and suddenly at about 8:
00 in the evening some body 
knocked on the door and we saw a stranger that told 
us are you ready and mo
ther and father said 
yes and we left the house.  We  followed the st
ranger.  We  walked through the town which was 
already dark and heavy snow.  We  
knew that we are out after 8:00 
if we got caught that would be 
the end of it, but nobody paid too much atten
tion to us.  Because we are not situated 
geographically in the _____________, that was in our fa
vor.  So, we in that evening we already 
broke all the rules and we  broke through the edge 
of the town, where that gentlema n had a car, a 
taxi.  He mo tioned us to enter the taxi 
and he drove us away from ___________________.  We ll, 
we left ____________________ and at the edge of th
e town was a taxi waiting and the 
gentlema n pointed that we should en
ter the taxi.  So, my sister, my
 mother my father and myself 
entered the taxi and the taxi car started 
slowly, slowly edging away from _____________.  I do 
not reme mb er how long we traveled
 in the taxi but it must have
 been a couple of hours because 
visibility was mi serable.  It was snowing very 
heavily and he was driving very slowly.  After 
several hours we arrived at our de
stination.  At that time  I di
dn't know where we were but the 
taxi driver again said we shoul
d exit the taxi.  He stopped, we 
should exit the taxi and outside 
was waiting for us a gentlema n who t ook us to hi
s far m.  We  walked for about a hundred yards 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0274  
17 
 
and we entered his farm.  The taxi driver said 
goodbye to us and he con
tinued in his journey.  I 
didn't know where he came from or where he wa
s going to.  In the farmer's house we caught our 
breath, we got something to eat, and I was told that
 we will have to wait.  I was not told why or 
for how long.  After waiting for quite a while the far mer came back in dressed in a heavy coat 

and boots and said okay let's go.  I didn't know 
where to, but as a good 
boy I didn't ask ma ny 
questions and all four of us le
ft the farmhouse led by the farmer.  The farmer walked with us on 
the ma in road for about half a mile and then he left the ma in road and started walking towards 

the forest.  We walked in heavy, heavy snow for a
bout half a mile in the direction of the forest 
and when we entered the forest, we kept walk
ing.  I do reme mber the snow was comi ng down 
very, very heavily.  I think at 
some  point I lost even my s
hoes  but we kept walking.  I do 
reme mber as we were walking suddenly I saw 
a window from which light was shining.  I heard 
some dogs barking and I heard sing
ing and my father and the farm
er indicated with their finger 
to keep quiet and to keep walking.  After an ad
ditiona l half an hour or hour of walk we came 
again to a farmer 's house where they already were
 waiting for us.  We  were totally lost, and we 
were led to an attic in which ther e was some ha
y and some  straw and we laid and rested for a 
couple of hours.  Only then I was told that
 we crossed the international border from 
_______________ to Slovakia.  We  are now in Slovaki
a.  In that attic grandfather and 

grandmother were waiting for us.  We rested 
for a couple more hours and the farmer took us 
again to the ma in highway on the Slovak side of 
the border where there was a sled wa iting for us 
drawn by horses.  They took us deeper into Slova
k territory to a farm hous e where we entered a 
barn and we were hiding there.  Now, from even
ts that later on took place, I understood that my 
grandfather and grandmother were afraid that
 once our escape will be made known the Germans 
will of course  very easily figure out that we mu
st have fled to Slovakia and in all likelihood will 
notify the Slovak authorities to ar
rest us.  So, from that point 
on, we stayed in hiding until the 
end of the war, with grandfather 
and grandmother.  For some  period of time  there was six of us, 
but at some point my sister separated from us 
because she was able to learn the Slovak language 

and being a woma n it was virtuall
y impossible to prove that she was Jewish for obvious reasons 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0274  
18 
 
and she lived out the rest of the war in Brat
aslava which was the capital of Slovak Republic 
working under an assume d name  and forged papers and she worked as a secretary. 
Q. A couple things, when you went by that hous
e and your father told you to be quiet, who 
were those people? 

A. That was a guard house, the nazi German 
guard house that during 
the day the soldiers 
were staffing the border crossing.  Like ma jority
 of international borde
rs you have that wooden 
bar that is down and the soldiers check your 
i.d.s but during the night when everybody is home 
and it being Christma s there was no traffic there. 
 The soldiers instead of being outside freezing 
they went to the guard house to celebrate Christma s.
  Because after all, they
 were also away from 
their families and being in a warm cozy house, th
ey were celebrating Christma s and singing.  In 
all likelihood they had some  alc
oholic beverages too.  That's  how 
our journey into hiding began. 
Q. Wasn't  there some  fear of reprisal from the Germans?  

A. Yes, that was the reason why our grandpare
nts left their home of the Slovak side and 
joined us in hiding because of the fear that 
the nazis, the Slovak n
azis will put two and two 
together that we must have obt
ained help from the Slovak side 
and the logic would have pointed 
towards our grandparents that th
ey must have engineered our escape.  The assumption was a 
correct one because the neighbors of our grandpare
nts later on told us that not long after the 
grandparents had left, the Slovak fascists came 
to the house to look for them.  These a r e the 

distances are very mi nuscule and one telephone
 call arranges ma ny, ma ny things, especially 
when the caller is a gestapo high 
official so that we had a window
 of about two days because we 
fled about three days before th
e transport should have departed. 
 Therefore we had some  window 
in which to breath a little bit more freely, but on
ce everybody reported to the 
railroad station they 
discovered very quickly that we are mi ssing and th
ey started very seriously looking for us.  From 
that point on, we never stayed very long in any 
one place of hiding.  Because
 of my grandfather's 
collections of a me dical doctor, ma ny far mers ow
ed their lives to him.  Many of them were 
helping us very willingly.  There were a few who 
did it purely for monet a ry
 reasons and to those 
we had to pay very heavily.  But the ma jority of
 them did it as gratitude to grandfather.  The 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0274  
19 
 
problems were why we couldn't stay in any pl
ace too long, the reasons were very obvious.  
Number one, in those parts of the country peop
le know one another.  The grocer knows that 
when a farmer come s to buy his supply he used
 to buy for years and years the same  a mount of 
supplies.  Suddenly he buys thr
ee time s as muc h.  So, it raises 
suspicion.  Why do you suddenly 
need so muc h food.  Problem numbe r  two, visi
bility.  You always had to stay away from 
windows because some one ma y see you through the window.  People know one another to such 

an extent that they know exactly in which r
oom you are eating, your stove.  Suddenly through a 
chimney that was not used for years, smoke co
mes out.  So, these were
 all signs that some  
unusual activity is taki ng place in
 the house and therefore to lower 
the level of suspicion we had 
to be continuously on the move.  Fur t herm
ore, the Germans from _____________ issued a large 
monetary reward for our capture and that was ve
ry tempting to some  far mers who alwa ys lived 
on the edge of poverty.  Simply, we ha d to go from one place to another. 

Q. As a boy, was this difficult or was it an adventure? 

A. That already began to be difficult.  I st
opped seeing it as an adventure.  Why was it 
difficult?   Nu mber one because I was a growing b
oy.  My mo veme nt was very restricted because 
we had to stay in one room or always be on a 
lookout how we exit the ro
om and whe r e to.  My 
move me nt was restricted and number two whenever
 we mo ved from one hiding place to another 
we did it in the mi ddle of the night.  I never 
knew how long we would st
ay in a certain place, 
how far away we would move and whether we would 
be for the next month living in an attic or a 
cellar.  That at that point
 became very, very irritating. 

Q. Did you know most of the people who hid you
?   Or did your grandf
ather know who they 
were beforehand? 

A. In most cases he knew who these people 
were, in most cases.  In several cases the 

relatives of those whom he knew but for almost
 all the time he knew the collections, how it all 
went. 

Q. Do you ma ybe want to go back and get specif
ic.  Tell me  about these places and describe 
what they were for us. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0274  
20 
 
A. That part of Slovakia I do not believe has a
ny thing compatible that  I can relate to in the 
United States.  That part in t
hose days Slovakia had isolated fa
rms.  They were about two or 
three miles apart from each other.  You could have
 seen from one far m to the ot her providing the 
weather was good, providing the terrain permitted you to do so.  The farmers, during the summer  
months were farming.  They had a cow or two. They had some  pigs, they had some  chickens.  

They had some  s mall fie l ds where they raised va
rious things.  During the 
winter, they used to 
supplement their income  by tending the forests.  Th
ey were also lumberjacks.  Some  of them 
during the long winter months supplemented th
eir income  by producing toys from wood or 
wome n wer e  gathering feathers.  In
 those days, most of these farm
s did not have electricity.  All 
of it was done by kerosene lamp so
 that the life was very, very sl
ow, but it was sort of a friendly 
relation because they all depended on one another.
  Most of the farmers knew that if they got 
caught, they would be shot.  You were in no pos
ition to hide Jews and go to the police station 

and say hey I'm hiding Jews and want my reward. 
 It did not work that wa y.  If you wanted your 
reward you had to say that farmer over there is 
hiding Jews or partisans.  Then you may have 
gotten your reward.  If the Germans didn't feel
 like giving it to you, they ma y have accused you 
of being a collaborator and shot
 you together with that farmer
 who was hiding those Jews or 
partisans.  With the Germans or Slovak fascist w
ho learned all the tricks of the game from the 
nazis, you never knew where you were standing.  
You would never be able to outguess them. 
Q. Did they have a large presence in 
the area?  We r e  they always around? 
A. We did discover an interesting phenomenon.  Th
e  closer the fa rm was situated to a forest, 
the more often the Germans seemed to ma ke their presence known.  Na me ly, there were German 

units mi xed with the Slovak fascists units who pe
riodically conducted raids into the forest not so 
much with trying to find Jews but trying to find par
tisans.  In one of such raids, we were caught. 

Q. That's a little 
bit later is it not? 
A. Maybe. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0274  
21 
 
Q. I'd like to get back to a certain chro
nology, if you don't mi nd.  The first pl ace -- the 
second place you went after you came into Slovakia
, you were in a barn or an attic with your 
grandparents.  Exactly where was 
that and how long were you there? 
A. How long I do not know myself.  I only know 
that we never stayed in any one place 
longer than a few weeks, ma ybe a month and it
 would be futile to try to look upon a ma p and 
find the way we progressed because nu mber one depending on the political situation, some  
far mers may have indicated will
ingness to provide shelter for us and a day later change their 
mi nds.  Some farmers had various excuses.  Yes,
 we would hide you but 
we have small children 
who go to school and they ma y say some thing.  
It took lots and lots 
of cooperation to find 
some body who was willing to hide five or six people.
  As I sa id before so me  places we stayed 
longer, some  places we stayed a short time .  I reme
mber one far mer had a pr
egnant wife so all of 
a sudden she started in birth.  We  had to leave. 
 Although my father was a doctor, my grandfather 
was a doctor, but we didn't  know ahe a d of time what complications ma y emerge and she ma y be 

forced to go to the hospi tal.  So, that we con
tinuously moved from one place to anot her.  Some  
were better, others were wors
e but basically the pattern stayed the same .  Avoid windows.  
Always ask if everything is cl
ear if you want to go out, and wh
en we did go out, it wa s usually 
during the night, complete darkness.
  We usually went out just to
 take a breath of fresh air and 
ma ybe walk a little bit, 
otherwise we were continuously most 
of the time in darkness and if we 
were in an attic the farmer usually erected a 
false wall between the house and the stacks of hay 
and we were separated by bales of hay.  Because 
again, it was assume d that if a German patrol  
will come and search the house, ma ybe they do not
 realize that the spac
e in the attic does not 
confor m to the length of the house.  But of cour
se, looking at it later on when such raids were 
ma de, those units that were traine
d in finding partisans or Jews kne
w all the tricks of the game.  
They were not even afraid to set the house on fi
re if they had suspicions that some body was there 
and they could not find him.  

Q. Did that ever happen to you? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0274  
22 
 
A. No, that did not happen to us, with exception 
as I said before that on one occasion we did 
get caught. 
Q. When was that? 

A. That was again, it happened because of
 a unit mi xed Germans and Slovaks were 
searching for partisans, and I do not reme mber wh
ether they came to the far m on their way back 
but I think that they must have come  to the fa
rm before their raid actually started and their 
destination was the forest, but th
ey came  to the farm to get some  drink of water and they 
searched the house for partisans and they stumbl
ed upon us.  So, the commandant of t he unit had 
a dilemma.  In all likelihood six Je
ws, he did not want to abort hi
s raid and bring six Jews with 
him to the barracks and show this as a product of a 
days work so he decided to continue his raid 
of the partisans and ma de us swear that next da y we will voluntarily appear in hi s barracks.  To 

emphasize, to stress the point that he means busine
ss, he ordered one of the soldiers to rape my 
mother.  Her father, her husband and her son had 
to watch it.  At that point we knew what was 
waiting for us.  After the unit left, we fled the fa
rm.  It was in deep snow in winter and these 
units never ventured very deeply into the forest.  
They were afraid of the partisans.  They usually 
went into the forest about a hundred yards and st
arted widely shooting into
 the forest hoping that 

they will hit someone and some occasions they hit someone, but once they heard a human voice 

they entered the forest and dragged the partisans 
out.  We  kne w they went in a different direction 

and we fled into the forest away from the farme r 's
 house.  The farmer sent after us a couple of his 
friends who inside the forest dug out for us a 
bunker in the ground in which we went in hiding.  
About two days later another farmer whom we 
di d not know came to visit us and brought food 
supplies and told us that the uni
t returned two days later to th
e farmer 's house and burned the 
house to the ground and shot the farmer and all of 
his fa mily for harboring us.  We  spent from 
that point on time in that bunke
r underground.  You know when I'm talking about forests, these 
were very, very deep forests.  The _______________ forest stretch for miles and miles.  There is 

no end to them.  We got a small stove and during 
the night we kept warm by feeding the forest 
with dried wood because dried wood does not emit 
any smoke.  We were heating only during the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0274  
23 
 
night.  One time  the sense that some  German 
patrols didn't pass too far away from our bunker 
and when the farmers came next time, we dug out
 another bunker and we 
moved away from the 
old place to a new bunker.  There was another ho
rrible story.  We discove
red that not far away, 
by not far away I don't mean a hundred miles, I mean
 several miles from us, there were a couple 
other bunkers and the young me n ke
pt visiting the other bunker a
nd while he was on his way to 
visit the other bunker the German pa
trol discovered this bunker in wh
ich his parents were hiding.  
They shot them.  He visited his friends in the ot
her bunker who were alive.  He left them, after a 
half an hour went back to his own bunker.  He f
ound his parents shot.  He returned back to his 
friends' bunker who in the mean ti me was discov
ered by the Germans and found them shot too.  
He was simply saved by the fact that he was 
on a trip between the two bunkers and the German 
patrol never stumbled upon him.  
Q. How did you know about that? 

A. Later on when he found his parents and his friends dead, he came  to us and told us about 

it.  We  were a few times visited by injured partisans because of two doctors.  They sought us out 

on several occasions.  My father and my grandf
ather removed the bullets of the wounded ones. 
Q. So there was some  sort of communic a tion 
information being passed between all of you in 
hiding?  

A. Well, very careful, very limited, 
but there was some  communication, yes. 
Q. Were there a lot of othe
r refugees in this area? 

A. No, very, very few.  Afte r the war, a l
ong time after the war has ended I found out I was 
already in Israel I found out that
 one fa mily was hiding not far 
away from us and the German 
patrol  was shooting into the forest and the fa
ther was hit by a bullet and he screamed the 

Germans came and dragged the whole family and se
nt them to a concentration camp, but they 
survived the war. 

Q. Was the fear constant?   Were you always 
very guarded about your moveme nts?   We r e  

you frightened? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0274  
24 
 
A. Well, in the forest time  lost its meaning because what you were mostly observant you 
were worried about the weather.  When it didn't 
snow, the forest was beautiful.  The snow was 
clean, the trees were beautiful.  The problem be
gan when it rained because we lived in a bunker 
that was covered by tar paper.  It did not k
eep the rain completely away, so we were 
continuously freezing, always cold.  Cold and hungr
y because the provisions that we received 
didn't have ma ny vita mi ns.  For example, each scra
tch, the smallest scratch caused infection.  So, 
you were always suffering from something.  Th
e life was simply I think the time lost its 

meaning.  The only joy was when a far mer came  to bring some  provisions and telling you the 

latest news from the front.  And logic kept telli
ng us that when the German
s began to retreat they 
started sl owly, slowly losi ng interest  in catching Je ws.  Then apparently they reached a point in 

their philosophy that they cons
idered the _____________and Slovakia to
 be free of Jews.  So, 
they began to venture less and less frequently on 
these raids.  The danger of course rema ined 
constantly that somebody will sell you out for the 
reward.  That held true until the very end.  
That never ceased. 

Q. This area that you were in, can you just for 
the record, name  a few of the nearby villages? 
A. I don't know if it's going to exist because as 
I said before I think, 
ma ny of these villages 
were consolidated.  Some of them even changed th
eir name s but we are talking in the vicinity of 
________________.  The villages of _____________, ____________, _________________, 

________________, otherwise all under norma l conditions
 beautiful villages.  Very, ve ry 
friendly people under normal conditions. 

Q. How would you spend an average 
day, if there wa s such a thing? 

A. Doing absolutely nothing but sleeping.  
Sleeping, sleeping and 
sleeping and trying to 
save strength.  Maybe once a day leaving the bunke
r for ma ybe half an hour and trying to gather 
twigs fallen fr om trees so that we will be ke
pt warm during the night.  But otherwise, doing 
absolutely nothing, not even talking. 

Q. Was that your primary responsib
ility, bringing in the firewood? 
A. Yes, that was my responsi
bility because I was the youngest. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0274  
25 
 
Q. Did you have any contingency 
plans when you were in a place? 
A. Yes, and that would have been some thing 
I definitely would have forgotten to tell you 
had you not asked.  I did realize on several occasions
 that my  grandfather ha
d five or six buttons 
in his pocke t and I was told they contain poison, which he would have give n to each one of us to 
drink had he sensed that we were caught.  That  wa s the only contingency plan that we had.  

Luckily enough, we never had to ma ke use of it,and that one time that we
 did get caught, it came 
so quickly that he was unable to di stribute it an
yhow, but that was because we were caught in a 
far m house where the dogs were 
already barking giving us warni
ng.  We saw already that human 
approaching from a distance.  In the forest,I don't know -- I cannot describe to you a scenario 

how we would have gotten caught, whether the Ge
rmans would have had dogs with them, I don't  
know.   But that I asked once Gr
andfather years after the war wh
at was in those bottles and he 
told me , poison. 

Q. You did not know at the time? 

A. At the time  I did not know. 

Q. Now, was there ever a point when you we
re separated from the rest of your fa mily? 
A. Yes, I had a __________ where at some  point 
my  grandfather made some arrangement 
for me  to attend alone by myself 
for one an half years a school 
in a very distant small village 
under an assume d na me  and under an assume d religi
on.  But after about a year and a half living 
in that village, the residents bega
n to ask my identity.  Some  of th
em started to suspect that I am 
Jewish and one old lady asked me  I should show he
r my penis, whether I am circumcised or not.  
So, when that came, the people who were hiding me  said you have to go back to your 

grandparents and join your parents to hide. 

Q. Why had your fa mily decided to send you out? 

A. Mainly because of the schooling because 
I had attended regular school.  That was the 
only year that I had school out of the nine gr
ades required by Czech law, I had three years all 

together, and that was one of the three. 

Q. And they decided that even in this extraordinary time s, you should go to school? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0274  
26 
 
A. Yes, because  again it was already when Slova
kia was considered to be free of Jews so 
they thought that there will be no suspicion. 

Q. Who was the fa mily that did that? 

A. That was a Lutheran mi nister and unfort
unately he was imprisone
d under the communists 
and died in jail for Luther an religious 
activities against the communist state. 
Q. And your grandfather knew him?  

A. Yes, he knew hi m.  

Q. I'm going to ask you mor e  about that, but why don't we change types.

A. The life in that village was very, very pleasan
t change.  It wa s a very picturesque village.  
The Lutheran mi nister was a bachelor.  He owne
d I think it probably came 
with the territory, he 
had a little farm.  There was a cow, and he raised
 angora rabbits.  Each wi
nter the rabbits had to 
be clipped and he had a sister also an old spin
ster who was living with him who kept house, and 
she was processing the wool fr
om the rabbits, so there was a lot of spinning going on and 
combing the wool and knitting and again that vill
age was without electricity so wome n used to 
go from one  household to the other and block feat
hers, and all sorts of stories were told by 
blocking the feathers.  The village had a post 
office which had a telephone.  It was the only 
telephone in the whole village.  Later on by pur
e accident  I found that the mi nister had a car 
which was hidden in a barn under a stack of hay and 
that explained to me  th
e occasional noise of 
an engine.  Na me ly, what was he
 doing?   He was recharging th
e battery by the engine and he 
used the battery for listening to a short wave 
radio.  I caught him once listening to London and 
Moscow and he knew the latest news about 
mo veme nt on the fronts.  There was only one 
impedi me nt in the otherwise beautiful setting. 
 That with him was living a young school teacher 
who was teaching in a ne ighboring village and he 
pretende d to be a great enticement who always 
voiced his suspicion.  Many, ma ny years later I found 
out that he did it purposely to keep them 
on their toes.  To keep me always alert.  But othe
rwise, life in the village 
was very, very pleasant, 
very serene because the village was in 
a valley, mountains surrounded it.  _______________ was 
about two hours away by bus that used to depart
 from the village very early in the mo rning and 
used to come  back late afternoon and usually the v
illages took a ride once a week to the nearest 
town when they had to buy some thing not obtainabl
e in the village stor e.  On one such occasion I 

took a ride to the town and strangely enough the to
wn had a catholic church which the president 
of Slovakia at that time , ________________ was his na
me , was a priest of, and he used to 
conduct every Sunday services in that churc
h.  _____________ was the name  of the town and on 
one such occasion, I went to the town and saw h
im giving this service in a catholic church.  So, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0274  
28 
 
when the people of the village be
gan to ask my religion, apparently
 the Lutheran mi nister got in 
contact with my grandparents and 
I was shipped back to the bunker. 
Q. While you were in this village, did you 
have false papers, did you try to pass as a 
Christian boy? 
A. Yes.  One of my grandfather's friends used 
to be a school teacher who issued in my na me  
a false school certificate under an assume d na me .  I was named ____________ of Lutheran 

religion.  To cover up my inadequate Slovak language
, it was stated in the ce
rtificate that I came  
from a town called _____________ which was exactly on the border of the Czech and Slovak 

lands where they spoke a very mi xed Czech Slova
k language, the same  that I was talking.  But 
that persistent woma n who wanted to know if I 
was really Lutheran, that certificate didn't mean 
much.  She still wanted me  to put my pants down. 

Q. Now, did you learn prayers, did you go to chur
ch?   What sorts of things did you have to 
do to pass? 

A. Okay.  To pass, that village was so small 
that it had a school with only one classroom.  
The teacher always divi de d the blackboard into va
rious se gments and while he lectur ed to one 
grade he gave assignment, written assignment to a
nother grade.  In the morning before we started 

the school we Lutherans had to get 
up and had to pray with our hands hanging loose by our sides.  
The catholics used to pray cro
ssing their hands in this fashi
on.  And they used to cross 
themselves where we Lutherans di d not.  Because I was living with a Lutheran mi nist er I 

accompanied him every Sunday to the church in 
which in conducted the services and I had two 
tasks in the church.  I wa s helping an older guy to 
ring the bells to call in wo
rshipers to services.  
That was a gr eat, gr eat challenge, because I was ve
ry small and I think ther
e were three bells.  I 
was never able to master  my bell to fall into 
step with the ot her two 
bells the other guy was 
pulling on because the rope of my bell when it we
nt up, always took me along with it.  I was not 
heavy enough to bring the rope dow
n again, so I was jumping from one side to another.  Then, 
because the village didn't have el
ectricity, but the church had an 
organ, our school master pl ayed 
the organ, but somebody had to keep pumping th
e organ.  So, again I took place among the other 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0274  
29 
 
volunteers to pump the organ.  And again, I was 
very small and light in weight to pump the 
organ so that the sound of it did not dimi nish.  S
o, these were some  of the challenges I was faced 
with.  Also, on one or two occasions, the farm he
lp took me to pasture to guard the cows and 
once or twice the cow escaped from me  and I ha
d great difficulty finding the cow while he was 
taking a nap I had to gather the cow.  But all in all,
 I think that one year th
at I was in that village 
was probably the most pleasant time  during 
all those years of wa
r that I reme mber. 
Q. Even though you were separated from your fa mi ly? 
A. Even though I was separated from
 my parentsand my grandparents. 
Q. Did you have to me morize prayers? 

A. There was always only one prayer in the mo
rning which I still think I vaguely reme mb er 

some thing like "Dear Father, give us our daily br
ead and forgive all our sins, like we forgive our 
sinners,"  some thing of t hat nature.  It was not
 very long.  Some thing came back to me , while I 
went to school in the ____________ in the first grade for the short time I was permitted to attend 

we were learning to recite the alphabe t and at 
that time the Czech alphabet has h and after h 
come s a combination of C and H which is pronounced ________ and when we came to that it 

was pronounced _______ _________.  In as much as the president of the ____________ was a 

fellow name d _______ _________, we had to stand up for that split of a second when we recited 

the alphabet.  But going back to Slovakia, th
e prayer was alwa ys one in the same .  For  
appearances sake, I also went to Sunday school
 where we learned the 
theory of Lutheran 
religion.  Inasmuch as I never was deeply involv
ed in Jewish religion, it was quite pleasant, 
relaxing to learn about Lutheran 
religion.  There was not a trace of
 animos ity in it.  The religion 
was not used in that particular village to antagon
ize anyone.  It was just there to serve the people 
and to unite them under the umbrella of religion. 

Q. Was there anything particularly striki
ng about the sermon that Father ___________gave 
when you had gone to that town? 

A. No, because number one it was a very large c
hurch.  The chur ch was a catholic church.  It 
had very good attendance.  I 
suspect that had Father ____________ 
not been a fascist, probably 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0274  
30 
 
fewer people would have attended his services.  
The only striking thing about it was the church 
was very well guarded by arme d tanks while he 
was giving the service.  But when he came out, 
he looked very benign, very meek kind of fellow that
 probably wouldn't be able to kill even a fly.  
I do not believe that he ma de any everlas
ting impression on anybody.  
He of course was a 
hypocrite of first grade and as far as I know, he wa
s the only priest that ever ended up on the end 
of a rope.  After the war he was hung, which he deserved. 
Q. You didn't feel particularly stra
nge or uncomfortable being there? 
A. No, it was some thing new, some thing never 
experienced before.  It was curiosity that 
probably drove me  there more than anything else. 

Q. So, you went back to the bunker? 

A. Yes. 

Q. Can you just -- you told me a little bit a
bout your life during that time , but what 
physically wa s this place like because you were th
ere quite a while it seems on and off in this 
bunker?  

A. It was a hole in the ground.  In one corner
 a small stove and the long side a platform 
ma de of logs from fallen trees and on top of 
the logs was straw covered with a blanket and you 
have to visualize, we were -- our feet were f
acing each other.  On one side grandmother with 
grandfather and on the other side my  father, my 
mother and myself and we were touching with 
feet our grandparents.  The bunker had a couple st
eps, I don't reme mber, three or four, and there 
was a ma ke believe sort of a door that was bloc
king it so that it was always semi -dark in the 
bunker.  Wh en some body had to go out, he had to
 go a couple yards from the bunker and relieve 
himself.  So, before we went out, we always ch
ecked the weather and we tried to go out when it 
was either snowing or raining so to hide.  There 
were wild, wild animals in the forest.  We  got a 
couple visits from deer.  I think on one occasion 
I encountered a wild boar, but I think the boar 
was more afraid of me  than I was of him, because
 he ran away but scared me .  On one occasion I 
reme mber that it was snowing heavily and the farm
er was unable to reach us with supplies.  We 
were already starved almost clos
e to death.  My parents sent 
me  to find out why the farmer 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0274  
31 
 
wasn't  comi ng.  So in the deep snow I was walking to the farmer 's house, and I came upon a 
clearance in the forest, and as 
I came upon the clearance I heard the 
sound of airplanes.  All of a 
sudden it stopped snowing.  The clouds parted 
and brilliant sun was sh
ining and I looked up 
skyward and I saw allied airplane
s either going on a raid or comi
ng back fr om a raid because the 
airplanes were glistening in 
the sun leaving a vapo
r trail and throwing 
small cuttings of 
aluminum foil.  Allied planes always threw it 
to confuse German radar.  But all of a sudden I 
heard a terrible noise and in the distance I saw 
a cow.  I don't know, the cow was not attended.  
Some  far me r  ma y have let her to feed herself,
 and then I heard a trem
endous explosion.  What 
has happened?   One of the airplanes, an empty 
gas tank and that gas tank hit the cow and killed 
her on the spot.  That didn't happen very far away 
from me.  I could have 
been killed instead of 
the cow.  I reached the farmer and the farmer e
xplained that not only heavy snow but also illness 
of his wife prevented us from supplying us, 
but he gave us some  food supplies and he 
accompanied back to the bunker and brought us some  supplies of food s o we were saved once 

again from s t arvation. 

Q. What kind of food?  

A. We were talking about bread, potatoes, bacon, 
but all that had to eat 
very slowly and with 
great restrain because when you are not having f
ood regularly over eating can kill you.  Cheese, 
milk and he even brought us some  bandages and that was one time when really we were in 

danger of starving to death. 

Q. When you saw the allied planes, did that give you hope? 

A. No.  Numbe r  one the planes were very, very high.  Then, I was not quiet certain whether 

they are allied planes or  not.  One plane ma de 
me to believe that it was not German because of 
its configuration, and I think ma ny, many later I 
looked it up and I think it was a P-38 airplane 
that has a duel fuselage and th
at was a fighter which usually ac
commodated fuel for the bombers 
as an escort. At that time it was always our wi
shful thinking why can't  they land and take us on 

board, but that was wishful thinking. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0274  
32 
 
Q. When you were wishing did you think that 
you would get through this, that it would all 
be over with soon. 
A. Well, at that time, when we saw the allied 
airplanes we began to se
nse that the end cannot 
be far away because the airplanes flew unopposed 
from the Germans.  I had never experienced 
any bombing raids, but it seemed to me  that wh
en Germany i s  not opposing the allied planes that 

in all likelihood they
 don't have enough planes to do anything
 about it to begi
n with.  So, we 
thought that the end cannot be too far. 

Q. What other difficulties, or
 what were the greatest difficulties you had in hi ding?  
Anything that you haven't me ntioned? 

A. Only the constant fear of getting caught.  
The constant fear of getting caught.  That wa s 
the ma in, main issue item on our 
mi nds.  When finally the wa r ends, that was the second item.  
Additional difficulty, not knowing 
whether the infor mation we get is truthful.  What does it 
mean.  The people who were listening to the news
 kept alwa ys telling us which town fell into 
either Russian hands or allied ha
nds, so we were always trying 
to figure out how ma ny miles left 
before they reached us.  Then came the disappo
inting news that the Germans counterattacked 
and reconquered the town that they had lost a w
eek earlier.  Or the news came that either the 
Russians or the allies suddenly st
opped, stalled, not advancing fast
 enough.  Then the question on 
our mi nds was what will the Germans do when once they begin to retreat.  Will they scorch 

everything while retreating.  What 
route will they take when they do retreat.  Many, ma ny thing, 
the ma jority of them I pr obably forgot already bu
t these are some of the points that come to my 
mi nd today. 

Q. Did you know anything about 
the camps at that time ?  

A. No. 

Q. Did you know anything about the Slovak Na
tional uprising in the summe r  of '44?  
A. Yes.  Yes, we knew about that because when the uprising failed the partisans who 

participated dispersed through the 
mountains and some  s mall units from it came to us with their 
injured.  I should perhaps me ntion that my fath
er voluntarily worked fo
r one year in a Slovak 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0274  
33 
 
concentration camp as a dental doctor.  Inever found out how it came  all about.  Some body 
arranged for him to wor k as a dentist.  The na
me  of the camp was Wilno.  It is on the Slovak map 
of camps.  He must have made arrangement with the commandant of the camp that he will 

voluntarily work there for one year 
and that at the end of the year 
he was let go.  He was not part 
of the prisons that inhabited th
e camp, but I was never able to 
find out all the details about it. 
Q. So, at that time  he was not living with you? 

A. At that time he was not with us in hidi
ng.  He joined us when the year expired, and 
strangely enough, I do not know whet
her the Germans knew about it, because they never ma de 

claim upon him.  But again, from what I understa
nd, the Germans lost interest in us not long 
after we disappeared because they had other worrie
s than one Jewish family.  Furthermore, there 
is an interesting point which probably very 
few people know or are aware of.  The Germans 
shipped from Slovakia the Jews to concentration 
camps but the Slovaks had to pay for it.  The 
Germans di dn't do it for the Slovaks free of charge
.  So, therefore, the Slovaks on one hand yes, 
we want to get rid of the Jews but on the 
other hand we don't  have money to pay you Germans 
for the shipments of Jews.  I have so me place at
 home a balance sheet of how much each Jew 
cost the Slovak governme nt in money for his sh
ipme nt to Auschwitz or wherever he went. 
Q. Was there a sense of isolation?  

A. Yes, that was -- we felt very, very badly, the 
loneliness, the isolation 
from the rest of the 
population.  Always the shining st ar
 was that one day the war will end and things will be back to 
normal. 

Q. Do you have clear me mo ries of any of your 
rescuers, any of the farmers that helped you 
or housed you? 

A. Only of one, because simply I have his photo 
at ho me.  My sister sent it to me.  He was 
probably the most decent fellow under the 
sun.  Hi s name  was  ______________, very simple 
far mer.  I'm not certain he knew how to read or 
write.  He had a very, very small far m, but you 

have to look with a ma gnifying glass to find a more decent pe rson than he  and his wife were.  

That was a couple who practiced everything that 
was written in the Bibl e from A-Z, e verythi ng.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0274  
34 
 
At that time, he was already in his sixties.  He 
died a natural death.  That
 unfortunately, when the 
war ended and I left for my trip to
 Israel.  I left in 1949.  I came  b
ack the first time for  a visit in 
1965.  Most of the people who helped us during th
e war were dead already.  Additionally those 
people who helped Jews during the second worl
d war were not looked upon very favorably by 
the communist government for reasons that I don
't  quite understand but that's how things took 
turn later on after 
the war had ended. 
Q. How were you liberated? 
A. Oh, about a week before we actually were lib
erated the farmer came very excited that the 
Russian front is very nearby and we actually heardartillery nearby and he said that it's  a question 

of days or weeks before the whole fr ont will coll
apse.  Two days later he ca me  and said yes, I 
think it's safe for you to leave the bunker and you 
can join me  and we will go to my fa rm and we 
went straight  to the attic, because we were not li
be rated yet.  I reme mber that wall of the attic 

that did not contain the hay had 
breaks in the wooden panels a
nd I was looking outside and I saw 
soldiers fleeing, German soldiers fleeing.  Wh
ile running they took off their jackets, their 
trousers.  Many times running only in their underwear
, and then suddenly there was silence.  The 
far mer came  up and said it's all over, you can come
 down.  We  came  down we stayed for another 
day or two.  I think that was the 
first time I took a bath.  So did my parents after ma ny years.  My 
father shaved for the first time.  We threw away
 our clothes and got new ones and we went to the 
closest town which was already liberated.  But th
e town was not liberated by the Russians, it was 
liberated by Ruma nian units because about a 
year before the second world war ended the 
Ruma nians switched side s and joined the Russians.
  My parents deposited me  in an orphanage 
home  run by catholic nuns while they went
 to _____________ to see what happened to our 

house and grandparents went back to _______________ to
 see what happened to their house. 
Q. Do you remember the date of your li
beration and the name  of that town? 
A. The name  of the town was ______________.  It must
 have been in May of '45.  I stayed 
in that orphanage for about two or three days 
until my parents came back to fetch me  a nd took 
me  back to _______________.  We  got the house back a
nd they arranged for me  private lessons 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0274  
35 
 
with a school teacher because it was hoped and assu
me d that in September I would start a regular 
school year.  So, I spent the whole summer trying
 to catch up what I mi ssed for the past five 
years. 
Q. You were just given the hous
e back?  It was that easy? 

A. Well, it was not easy.  We had to sue, but 
the police evicted the people who were in the 
house and said that should they win the case they
 will be permitted to reenter the house, but in 
the mean time we have the fi
rst right to our own house. 

Q. When you returned was there a general feel
ing of welcome?   How did the local people 
accept you? 

A. Well, the neighbors where my mothe r  hi
d so ma ny of our possessions claime d that 
nothing of it survived, that th
e Russians stole everything fr
om them, which generally the 
population claime d whenever Jewish property wa s gi ven to them for safe keeping, they claime d 

that the Russians took it.  The Russians were 
thieves, no doubt about it.  When they saw an 
opportunity to steal some thing they did it.  
But they didn't do it whol
esale, they did it 
sporadically here and th
ere.  In Germany they did it wholesal
e, but in Czechoslovakia they didn't 
do it on a whole sale scale.  So, it was an excuse
 and many Christians enriched themselves with 
Jewish property. 

Q. In general how did they treat you? 

A. Many people came an openly apologized for not
 having talked to us during the war when 
the law said that Christians ca
nnot speak to Jews and Jews ca
nnot speak to Christians.  Many 
store owners who had these signs, Jews not welc
ome, didn't know what to say so it was a very 
sort of an ambivalent situation.  There were so
me  Christians who openly said we are very sorry 
that Hitler didn't kill all of you.  
It is di fficult to generalize. 
Q. What did it feel like going back to this atmosphere? 

A. I think that our initial feelings were oka
y.  Nobody now shoots at us.  We  can eat.  We  
can sleep in our own beds.  We  can start living 
or go back to normal life.  I think it was a 
tremendous sense of relief.  I do not believe that
 anyone that survived 
this holocaust had any 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0274  
36 
 
desire for revenge at least not 
from those people who survived the war in the form in which we 
survived it.  Now, I cannot speak on behalf 
of those in a concentration camp, but we had 
personal beef against that  unit that participat ed 
in raping my mother.  We  went to the trial and 
were called as witnesse s against the Slovak me mber
s of that unit.  The German soldiers, they 
disappeared.  They went back to Germany, 
but the Slovaks were caught, because they 
participated in other atrocities
, and each me mber  of the Slovak 
party got the rope.  That was 
some satisfaction. 
Q. Any uneasiness when you came back? 

A. Well, uneasiness we did not know exactly how
 the future will evolve.  There were of 
course trials.  There were ma ny Czechs who occ
upied high positions in the nazi governme nt, but 
to what extent they influenced actually our depa
rture of the transports, it 
was hard to ascertain.  
Because the atrocities were usually committed by the small guys, the big guys up in the 

hierarchy, they just si gned the documents givi ng 
the order, but the actual killing was committed 
by the little guys with the ri
fles, the bayonets.  So, you are 
wondering how do you divide the 
guilt.  Is that guy with the pen 
guiltier than the guy with bayone
t.  I don't know, I'm not God.   
Q. So, did you continue on?   Did you go to school in the fall? 

A. Yes.  I went to school.  My father got repl
acement for his dental pr actice but in a di fferent 
town.  We  sold the house in 
______________ and we move d to a different town where my father 
opened a dental practice.  I kept going to school
.  I finished the require
d number of years of 
schooling by the Czech law, but then another 
disaster struck.  The communists came , 1948.  

Some where and that now come s hi
story into play, Truman Church
ill and Stalin divided Europe 
and decided that Czechoslovakia will be under th
e Soviets influence, and the Czech governme nt 
agreed.  There again were traders that sold
 out the democratic governme nt, the communist 
governme nt, which was in exile.  There were 
two Czech governme nts in exile.  One in London, 
which came back and was governing until 1948 and 
there was a lessor government in Moscow 
that also came  back and was undermining the democratic governme nt and succeeded 

overthrowing the democracy in 1948 and took aw
ay its power and came to existence as the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0274  
37 
 
communist governme nt of Czechoslovakia.  We  
Jews who survived always thought about the 
Soviet and Russian pogroms under the Czars an
d we were afraid once Russian come  to 
Czechoslovakia once agai n the anti-semitism for wh
ich the Poles and the Soviets ar e so very 
well known that there will be another Holocaust
.  So, the ma jority of Jews, I among them, 
emigrated to Israel which in 1948, in May becam
e a nation.  My parents never accompanied me  
to Israel because the Czech government, again ev
en under the communist realized that too ma ny 
doctors are leaving and they considered doctors
 to be of great importance to the national 
economy and my father was caught in it and no
t permitted to accompany me to Israel, and I 
never saw my parents again. 

Q. They lived out thei r life  there?  

A. My mother committed suicide in 1953 and my
 father di ed of natural death in 1962 or 
1963.  I came for my first visit in 1965 back to Cz
echoslovakia.  I left Israel in 1959 and came to 
the U.S. so in 1965 I finally had enough money to 
afford a trip back to Czechoslovakia, but by 
then my father was dead already. 

Q. I know that this is a difficult thing to sp
eculate on, but do you think that your mother's  
death was very much affected by these war time experiences? 

A. No doubt about it.  No doubt.  As a ma tter of fac t  I have proof and I'm in the mi ddle of a 

fight with the Czech government about it.  We  were helped during our hiding years by two 

Czech fellows.  These two fellows after liberation of Czechoslovakia joined an organization 

called Amer ican Czechoslovakia Friendshi
p Club.  When the communists took over 
Czechoslovakia, they became  possession of me mb ersh
ip lists of this club and they arrested all 
the me mber s on the list.  These two fellows, somebody 
alerted them to the fact that they will be 
arrest ed and because we lived not
 too far away from the Austrian
 border, they came to us trying 
to cash on their favor they did for us and my mo
ther tried to arrange fo
r the two of them an 
escape to Austria.  Somebody revealed that plan
 to communi st police and they arrested my 
mother.  And they tortured her.  So, under 
nazis she was raped and under communists she was 
tortur ed.  On one occasion while at the police 
station, she jumped from a  window and committed 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0274  
38 
 
suicide.  I have her death certificate issued by 
the Czech governme nt but 
they are not willing to 
admit that she committed suicide because of the 
tortur e by the communist police.  That I cannot 
forgive them. 
Q. This must have been hard on your father? 

A. Yes, but I was never able to talk to hi m about it because when I came he was already 

dead some  two or three years. 

Q. You weren't  able to correspond w
ith him while you were in Israel? 
A. Yes, we did but you have to understand 
that correspondence was 
censored.  You never 
knew what to write whether that which you ar
e writing will not be detrimental to them. 
Q. Now, the grandparents, you left 
behind, did you ever see them again? 
A. You mean my grandfather and gran
dmother who were with us in bunker? 
Q. No. 

A. Oh, my grandmother, she went with a tr
ansport and I do not know
 exactly whether she 
died in ____________ or in Auschwitz.  Th
at transport, the _______________ had 900 people 
went with the transport.  I th
ink 26 came  back.  There were 
in Czechoslovakia I think about 
270,000 Jews.  After those that came back and went
 to Israel, Czechoslovakia was left with 
about 12,000. 

Q. What happened to your sister? 

A. My sister survived the war 
under the false papers.  She came 
back.  She joined us, but she 
never from that point on, was living as part of 
the fa mily.  I think the year s that she was living 
under the false papers as a secretary gave her a 
feeling of independence and after a few weeks of 
living with us, she left and lived always in diffe
rent towns completely independent.  She worked 

as a secretary.  She had great aptitude for foreign 
languages.  I think she also for a time a teacher 

in a _________ school of languages.  She knew 
extremely well German.  Later on she got 
ma rried and had children of her own. 

Q. As a Christian or a Jew?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0274  
39 
 
A. She ma rried a Christian and 
I think that she ra
ised her daughters w
ithout any religious 
affiliation.  She still lives in ________________.  One 
of her daughters unfortunately was killed 
in a freak accident.  She was a school teacher.  
The other daughter lives I think at the pr esent 
time in the capital of the Czech
 republic in Prague and I think she works in a hotel as a 
receptionist. 
Q. How difficult was it for you to rebuild your lif
e in Israel and in the United States?  Was it 
easy to sort of start 
all over on your own? 
A. Well, I think that each count
ry provided me  with different
 challenges.  I don't think you 
can put them under one umbrella. 
 The Israeli experien
ce I think was the harder one of the two 
because I was much younger.  I was only 17 when 
I came to Israel.  About a half a year after 
comi ng to Israel, I was already in the Israeli milit
ar y.  It was a newly established state which still 
had ma ny, ma ny problems with their neighbors.  Firs
t of all, in Israel, I was completely on my 

own.  There is absolutely no rese
mblance of the Hebrew language 
to the Czech language, so the 
Israeli experience was much harder than the American experience. 

Q. Were you lonely? 

A. In Israel?  Very lonely.  Very lonely, because
 in Israel, unfortunately we were always told 

of the harrows under the Nazis. 
 The Israeli government was hopi
ng to keep all the emigrants 
there by reminding them that only in unity is there 
strength.  And that is 
one of the reasons why I 
never liked Israel because I always felt that th
e wound of the holocaust  wi
ll never heal if you will 
be continuously remi nded of 
it every day and every day.

Q. You stayed in Israel until when? 
A. 1959. 

Q. Why did you decide to leave? 

A. Well, those relatives that  I had in Israel th
ey were number one, very distant relatives.  
They all had fa milies of their own.  Israel was a 
ne w country which at that time was in a constant  

danger from its neighbors.  Israel every day anot
her group of emigrants came  to Israel.  There 
was a great deal of unemploymen
t and I was there as a seventeen year old boy when I came.  I 
was barely 20 when I exited the Israeli ar my, when I was discharged fr om the military 

obligation.  I didn't have any schooling.  I didn't 
have any skill and under conditions that existed 
at that time  in Israel and my non existing support 
from relatives I was unabl
e to learn any skill.  
Furthermore, the Israeli economy was very hard 
to figure out.  You never knew what would be 
worthwhile studying or learning beca
use of the influx of i mmi grants.  Furthermore, the political 
line that Israel in those days 
pursued didn't give me  any hope  th
at one day there will be peace 
with the neighboring countries.  A
dditiona lly, every year I was at 
least two or three times called 
to serve in the military reserves.  Inflation 
was tremendous.  I was always on the edge  of 
subsistence and I didn't see any future for myself 
in Israel.  So, I contacted my grandfather who 
saved us from the holocaust and he once again pu
t his machinery into work.  Alerted the Israeli 
relatives who were dispersed through the war, wh
ether one of them could help.  For a long time I 
was led to be lieve  that  it will be my uncle who 
will be in the best position to help me.  My 

father's brother who did not partic
ipat e in the holocaust.  My fath
er's brother was a very wealthy 
textile me rchant in Czechoslovakia 
who used to travel every year 
for his vacation to Switzerland.  
When the Germans occupied Czechoslovakia he wa
s in Switzerland, so he never came  back to 
Czechoslovakia. He lost most of
 his fortune, because the nazis 
confiscated and closed all the 
Jewish accounts, but he was still left with a co
mf ortabl e amount of money in Switzerland.  But 
the Swiss made clear to him that he cannot rema
in and he purchased from some one an entrance 
visa to Canada.  While on boat to Canada it wa
s discovered that the Canadian visa was forgery 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0274  
41 
 
and instead of landing in Canada 
he ended in the U.S.  That is
 also some thing that he never 
wanted to reveal to me  how he did it.  But,
 elaborating on some thing which I did not cover 
earlier, there were people who already with the ri
se of Hitler sensed that  the catastrophe facing 
Europe and left  Europe in time.  There were ot hers who waited until the last mi nute and who in 
one way or another succeeded leaving Europe.  
I have relatives who for example found a safe 
haven in Shanghai having been occupied by Japane
se.  But the Japanese by far didn't ma tch the 
brutality of the Germans visa vie the Jews, and 
the emigrated after the war to Australia.  My 
uncle emigrated to the U.S.  Other distant relativ
es emigrated to Palatine.  So, my grandfather 
ma nufactured for me  exit from Israel either to Au
stralia or to the United States, but my uncle, for 
reasons of his own, never sent me  the require
d documents.  Those day, there was a crucial 
document for comi ng to U.S. called Affidavit of 
Support.  That I finally obtained from much 
more distant relatives in the United St ates and 
I wa s able to come  in 1959 after having to wait 
five years for the entrance to come .  The Unite
d States had a quota system
.  I don't know whether 
they still have it, and Czechoslovakia having be
en a very small country has a very small quota 
system, so the wait was very long. 

Q. When you fi rst got there, what
 were your first impressions? 
A. Number one, because I came from Israel that
 de spite its small size, Israel is a democracy, 
ma ny tourists from United States ar
e visiting Israel, so I was very, ve
ry infor med as to what I can 
expect to find in the U.S.  Once I was able to
 overcome  the disappointme nt that it was not my 
uncle who sent me  the Affidavit, I was able to
 take off al mo st imme di
ately.  I landed in New 
York.  I was living in a rooming house.  I found em
ployme nt  as a shipping 
clerk.  I started going 
to night school.  I was finally able to finish even
ing high school.  I enrolled
 in a college.  I paid 
for it from my own poc ket.  I finish
ed that in ten years.  I joined
 the U.S. Secret Service, which 
paid for my master's degree.  After I got my B.
S. I went back to Czechoslovakia and ma rried my 
sweetheart and brought her over here.  I was fine 
once I came to the U.S.  When comp ared to 
Israel or Czechoslovakia it was a cinch.  The labor
, the investme nt was visible imme diately here 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0274  
42 
 
in the U.S. if you are willing to work, ther
e is no limit how high you can go.  Absolutely no 
impedi ment. 
Q. You were pretty resilient? 

A. I think the nazis had some th
ing to do with that.  I think 
that I personally find in U.S. 
everything I was seeking.  Let me  put it this way.  
It's a love and hate relationship.  It depends on 
what you read in the newspapers, how ma ny murder
s we have.  There are ma ny aspects of life in 

the U.S. that are not very nice, but when you put 
everything on a scale, I think that there is no 
other country that come s even close to
 the United States in its opportunities. 
Q. What did all the experience -- did it impact 
your sense of being Jewish or sense of being 

religious at all, or the fact 
that you were hidden by Christians 
ma ke you think differently about 
being Jewish? 

A. You know s o me thing, people always ask me  do 
you think Judaism is a religion or is it a 
race.  I'm not certain.  It depends where, 
when and under what conditions.  The Germa ns 
considered it a race.  In Israel
 I think it's considered a national
ity because you would be surprised 
when I came  to Israel how very, very few Jews
 ever attended synagogue.  The feeling there in 
those days was that now that I am among my own people, why should I go to synagogue.  The 

children in Israeli schools learned 
about the old testament, not from
 a religious point of view but 
from a histor ical point  of view because it's Jewish history.  Yes, I think that the feeling of 

Judaism whi c h I have has been instilled on me  by
 wearing the Jewish yellow star.  By the years 

of reading the signs, Jews , to entry is forbidde n.  By being called Christ killer, these are the 

things that make me a w are of my Judaism.  

Q. Stigmatized? 

A. Stigmatized. 

Q. Do you feel any of the positive or spiritual aspects of it? 

A. No.  I still keep looking over my shoulders 
and try to rema in inconspicuous as possible. 
Q. So that's an obvious statement? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0274  
43 
 
A. Yes, definitely.  You know, occasiona lly 
I do me et people who went through the same  
thing that I did, but those people wh
o experienced it at  a later stage in their lives, it seems to me 
were able to better cope 
with it than I.  It didn't seem to ha
ve left such an everlasting impression.  
At least the fi rst part  of their lives was normal. 
 In the mi ddle of it they had a break, a bad break, 
but because they were older when it happened to th
em, maybe they were able to figure it out in a 
more sensible for m than I was.  I expe rienced that it became part of my growing up, part of my 
childhood and definitely the nazi era has changed 
my life from A to Z.  I have no doubt that 
millions of other people have the same problem.  Many of us immi grants wouldn't be here in the 

United States had it not been for the holocaust. 
 I don't know whether the 
state of Israel would 
exist today had it not been for the holocaust. 

Q. Let me  talk to you a little bit more about how it has this impact on you, how it has 

affected who you are today? 

A. Number one, if I can retrace my step a
nd draw a line number one I would have had 
regular schooling that every child has.  I wouldhave been able to judging by the fact that my 

father was a very well known dentist, I grew
 up in a mi ddle class family, upper mi ddle class 
fa mily, I probably would have been in able 
to have a professional background in the Czech 
society.  Probably instead of going to night scho
ol I would have been going to a regular school, 
and I would have achieved self act
ualization st age at a much earlier
 age.  I would not have been 
forced to learn two foreign languages.  Had I 
learned foreign languages,
 it would have been 
because I wanted to learn them and not b
ecause I needed to make livelihood under their 
umbrella.  It's pure speculation. 

Q. What about emotional or behavioral
 scars, have you thought about that? 
A. Yes.  I do get very easily intimidated, ve
ry easily.  I always seem to be looking for 
excuses.  I'd rather switch than fight.   

Q. Because? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0274  
44 
 
A. Because I'm afraid to confront an unpleasant 
situation head on.  I would never be able to 
occupy a position like Ralph Nadar. He always c
onfronts head on every situation.  I would ma ke 
a very bad politician.   
Q. How do you think that seeing what y
our mother went through affected you? 
A. I cannot clarify it entirely because wh
en I left Czechoslovakia it only bega n. 
Q. I'm talking about her attack. 

A. Oh, you me an when she was raped.  I do not kno
w.  I cannot isolate th
at instance and take 
it out from the whole thing.  I don't know how I w
ould feel had it not taken place.  I also cannot 
speculate that the raiding party 
caught us on the way back to th
e barracks rather than on their 

way out, and had they taken us with them.  There are ma ny, ma ny things left to speculation. 

Q. Are there certain other images that stick wi
th you that you dream about at night that you 
have never lost sight of? 

A. Yes.  One image of that light comi ng fr om that guard house when we we re crossing the 

border to Slovakia.  The noise of the dogs barkin
g and the singing of the German sol diers that 
keeps comi ng back and back and back again.  I don't know because it's relatively benign, but I 

still see that window.  They had electricity in that hut.  They didn't have any curtain.  The light 

must have been visible for miles. 

Q. What do you think got you through all of this? 

A. Luck and please don't ask me  to define lu
ck, I don't know.  If you want to be more 
realistic and not satisfy it with a phrase luck, 
I think that it was our grandfather who got us 
through it.  Without hi m, never.  We  would have
 never been able to su
rvive.  But once that 
whole move  was put into motion, the whole th
ing was luck nothing more and nothing less. 
Q. Is there anything else you'd like to add? 

A. Probablynot. 

Q. Thankyou. 

A. Mypleasure. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0274  
45 
 
A. (Viewing pictures)  Now, you are s
eeing a star which ev
ery Jew throughout 
________________ had to wear over his heart.  It was against laws to have it obscured in any 
fashion and the problem was that it had to be  sewn on.   You could not use any temporary 

attachme nt of the star to your j
acket or to your shirt.  You were
 responsible always for having the 
star vi sibl e. 

Q. How did it ma ke you feel wearing it? 

A. Well, have you read Harthorwn's  Sca r let Lett
er?   Like you are brande
d like cattle.  Wh at 
you see here are two passports of my  now deceased 
relatives who exited Austria in 1939.  At that 
time Austria was already under German occupation
 and it was considered part of Germa ny and 
as you can see the German passports were especi
ally stamped with the letter J to alert the 
examiner of this passport that this holder is 
Jew.  Wome n had inserted after their first name , 
mi ddle na me Sarah, to fortify the fact that sh
e's Jewish.  As you can see, the photos all are 
stamped by Nazi stamp with the usual swastika
 and obtaining such a passport in 1939 was 
extremely difficult.  There are ma ny phases to 
these which are some what obscure because in 
some cases the Germans permitted Jews to exit Europe but later they st opped it completely.  

What divided that line of thinki
ng is not even very clear to hi
storians and there are still ma ny 
debates about it.  Here you see 
a photo of me  with my
 mother and father and it was taken in 1933 
in ________________.  At that time still unoccupied 
Czechoslovakia.  Here you see on this 
photo my gr andfather.  The photo was ta
ken in ________________, here I am probably four 
years of age.  This is my grandfather's dog.  I reme mber his name  was ______________ and I 

am also with my sister.  In a
ll likelihood we ar
e there on vacation. 
Q. And this is the grandfather who saved you? 

A. Yes, who saved our lives, yes.  This pictur e shows me  in the Israeli military and was 

taken in all likelihood in 
1951.  That of course wa
s taken in ____________ Israel.
