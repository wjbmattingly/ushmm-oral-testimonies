Gideon and his sisterfled f rom  Nove Mesto where they had been living since the beginning of  

the war.  InOctober they m ade their wa y northeast toBanska Bystrica, which served as the 

centerof  the1944 uprising.  Becauseof  his connectiontotheW orking Group
, Gideon's father 

f led separately.  On this m ap of Slovakia here, you seeBanska Bystrica.  Asthe Nazis were 

nearing this town, the fam ily f led to them ountains where they were c aught inam assacre at 

Stare Hory.  Gideon'sm other and sister were killed. 
 
 
Gideon was takenf rom  them assacre siteby a m annam ed Henry Herzog who 
eventually took him  to the village of Bully wher e he was placed in thehome of Paulinaand 

Jozef  Strycharszyk.  This is a contem porary photographhereof  the hom e where Gideonwas

hear about ina little while.
 
 
Gideon is aphysicist and com puter scientist. He earned his Doctorate
 
in I s ra e l in 
Q u a nt um  P
h ysics
.  U
pon his retirement, as the A. James Clark Professor atthe School of 
Engineering and Applied Scienceat GeorgeW ashington University,  he was named the A. 
Ja m
es Clark Prof essor Emeritus of Engineering andApplied S
c ien ce .  T h is  is t h e f irs t t ime in  
thehistory of the GeorgeW ashington University that the Boardof Trustees keptanendowed 

chair titlefor an Em eritus 
P
rof e s s o r.
  
Gideonalso previously served as the school's dean.
 
 
Gideon has taught and held dean and chairman positionsatSyracuse University, 
the University of  Michigan, and the State Universit y of  New York atBuff alo.  He served in 

Israeli Ministry of  Defense in Research and Developm entand also served in the Israeli Air 

Force.  In addition to teachi
n g,  h
e has beenaconsultant with
 
governm ent agencies and 
private com panies and served as an expert witness inpatent and copyri ght litigation.  Andhe 

holds several patents. 
 
 
Gideon's son Ophir holds the titleof  Inaugural RobertL. McDewitt and Catherin
e  H.  
Mc De wit t  P
rof essorship.  Ophir served as Chair of  the Com puter Sciences Departm ent at 
Georgetown.  He isalso a prof essor in the Schoolof  Medicine at Georgetown.  Gideon and his 

son who also volunteers his time andexpertise here atthe museum are currently collaborating 

on several com puterprojects concerning how to restore degraded images.  One of these 

projects is a com puter
-
based initiative toaid in the recognition off aded docum ents. This was 
startedf ive years ago in cooperation with theGerm an team f rom  the Universit y of Bremen. 

T heir recent work in the Germ an laboratory led toa breakthrough inthe processing off aded 

docum ents andthis isnow the subjectof  three U.S.patentsand one international patent.  
 
 
One great use for this, I think
, 
we wi ll f indhere to im prove the usability of faded 
docum ents here inthe m useum 's collections. So that's very exciting. 
 
 
W ith that, I would liketo ask you to join me inwelcom ing our
 
F i rs t  P ers on
 
f or today, 
Gideon Frieder. Gideon, can you com eupon 
stage? 
 
 
[Applause]
 
>> Gideon Frieder:  Is this working?
 
>> L e s lie  S wif t :   It  is .  Ye s .
 
>> Gideon Frieder: T echnology now.
 
>> Leslie Swif t:  He knows m ore about it than I do, clearly.
  
Thank youfor joining us and thank 
you for your wi llingness to participate in
 
F i rs t  Pers o n
 
as you have several tim es in thepast.  
 
 
AlthoughGermany overran Poland in September
 
1939and soon dom inated 
Europe, your hom e country of Slovakia was allied with the Germans and theref ore not 
occupied by them untilm uch later.  Before we talk about the start of the war andthe events 

leading up toandf ollowing the Germ an occupation, perhaps you can startby telling us a little 

bit about your fam ily and comm unity life bef ore the war started. 
 
>> Gideon Frieder:  Before the war started, Iwas 2 years old
 s
o I can't tell you very m uch. T he 

war started.  Slovakia was allied with Germ any so it was not occupied
, 
as Leslie correctly 
sta ted
, b
ut itdoesn'tmeanthere was no persecution. T hef irst transports to Auschwitz in 1 942 
included, a
m on g o t he r s ,  
Slovak Jews, including m y grandparents.  So there was a 
persecution.  
 

 
I was gro wing up in this little town of  Nove Mesto. And all I knew was certain roads 
I would not go to, certain streets were dangerousfor me because the children will th
ro w ro cks 

atm e and call me various names which I didn't understand very we ll but they did.
 
>> Leslie Swif t: Because you were Jewish.
 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD

>> Gideon Frieder:  Because I was Jewish and because m yf am ily was known in town.  Asfar 
as I was concerned, apartfrom  these little incidents which Iavoided asmuch asI can, I led a 

normal life until 1944. 
 
 
In 1944, the Slovaks decided it'sf arbetter tobe on the side of the victors than on 
the side of the losers so there was anuprising against thef ascist governmentof  Slovakia. T he 

uprising spreadf rom BanskaBystrica, which was the center of the uprising, through the 

country.
 
 
Obviously the Germans couldnot afford to do that.  Everybody
 
who l ooks at the 
m ap
, y
ou will quickl y s ee the Germans couldnotaff ord tohave a strip of  land dividing between 
the 
N
orth and theSouth where they still havesom e arm ies sothey invaded Slovakia and Ihad 
to f lee.
 T
he regular lif e that I thought I was conducting stopped. W ef led through the 
m ountains andeventually cam e to Banska
 Byst rica .  

>> Leslie Swif t: To go back a little bit, you say your f am ily was 
k
nown in the town.  Partof this 

m usthave been due to your f ather'sprom inence.  Can you tell us about your father?
 
>> Gideon Frieder:  Not part, all of  it.  My father was a chief  rabbi ofcertain part of Slovak 

Jewr y.  He was an unusual man, although you will reali ze I m ay bea bitbiased.
 
 
For exam ple, throughhis studies he alsof inishedafull degree in asecular
 
university m ajoring in Germ an literature andphilosophy eventually obtaining a Doctorate 

degree in German literatureand philosophy.
  
He had adiary which i s today parts of the 
m useum . T he originals are in Jerusalem  in a m useum  but we havea copy here, a scanned 

copy here.
  
Suff ice it to say, he died at 36 and thediary is written inf ive different languages, all 
of  which hem astered. So he was anextraordinary m an.
 
 
Because of his knowledge of  the languages and because of his secular degree, 
university degree, which was obtained in arguably the bestuniversity in Slovakia, he was the 

ideal m an to be part of  the 
W or k i n g G r o up
 
asa, soto speak, Secretary of  State.  He was 
responsiblef or ties with the Slovak governm ent and with the Germ an Em bassy or em issary, 

am ong other things,meeting alsoEichm annat the tim e. He spokef luently Slovak, Germ an, 

Hungarian, them ajor languages spoken in that part of the country so he was therefore the 

interf ace tothe government. And theref ore, he was also known notonly to the Jewish 

comm unity but also very m uch tothe Christian com
munity.
  
Slovakia is about 85% Catholic, 
15% protestant.  Andhe was ver y well
-
kno wn in the bothprotestantand Catholichierarchy.
 
>> Leslie Swif t: And so was he then, because of his prom inenceand because of his role,able 

to shelter you som ewhat prior to 1944?
 
>> Gideon Frieder:  Yes.  Ourfam ily was reasonably sheltered.  Ihave to correct. Our 

im me d ia te  f am ily
:  h
e,his wif e, andhis two children.  My parental grandparents were 
d
eported 
and killed.
 
>> Leslie Swif t:  In 1942.
 
>> Gideon Frieder:  In 19
42 .
 
>> Leslie Swif t: W ere you able to be in school?
 
>> Gideon Frieder: W e were sheltered.  I was ableto go to school. There was even a Jewish 

school that I attended in Nove Mesto, ledby m y uncle,by the way, who was the principal.
 
So we were sheltered
 
until such time thatthe Germans invaded and the whole gam e changed.  
And then he was obviously a m arked man
 i
nstead of being sheltered.
 
>> Leslie Swif t: W etalked a little about the deportations in 1942 but you had told Bill that Jews 

were still being deported althoughnot in thism ass way as in 1942. Can you please tell me a 

little bitm oreof  the role the Slovak governm ent had in the deportations before1942 andthen 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

again af ter?
 
>> Gideon Frieder:  In 1942, the Slovak gover nm entdid a census
 
of th e  J
ews.  I know it ver y 
well because we got here in them useum  a copy of  the census.  Not becauseof  the goodness 

of  the heartof  theSlovak governm ent but becausethe Museum paid a lotof  money tom ake 

m icrof ilm  copiesof  theJewish census and I worked on it
 
as part of my volunteering in the 
m u s eum .
 
 
T he Jewish census was a com prehensive census of all the Jews.  Ever y little town 
hadto reportabout the Jews.  So som e towns wrote som ething like: I am  proud to say
 
--
 
t h is  
is com ingf rom  them ayor.  I'm  proud to say that we have no Jews in our township and we 

intend to keep it that way.  Very proudly. 
 

 
So the censusof  the Jews was done in order to be able to deport them , in order to 
be able, essentially
,  
tokill them . T he Slovak governm ent hadthe dubious di
s t i n c t i on  of  bei n g 
oneof  thefew collaborators who paid, paid,the Nazis for every Je w they took away and killed.
 
W hen Iheard about that, I didn't believe it.There was a Germ an econom ist, youngm an, 

non
-
Jewish who camehere who was interested inthe question of how Germ any could f inance 
the SecondW orldW ar.  And he cam e tothem useum  and said:  I know thatpart of them oney 

cam ef rom  Slovakia because they paid totheGerm ans. I couldn'tbelieve it.  He saidf ind it.  

So I wentover to the
 A
rchives and
 
Ifound the docum ent. And Ihave it.  I mean Ihave the 
scanned copy of  the document.
 
 
T he Slovak
s 
paid theGerm ans 500
 
--
 
a king's ransom  at the tim e,for every Je w 
they took.  You wouldask
:  W h
ere didthe Slovak
s 
get them oney to payf or it? T hat's v
e r y 
sim ple.T hey had thecensusof  the Jews.  So they conf iscated theJewish property.  So the 

beauty
 
--
 
and Iput beauty in quotes
 
--
 
t he  
ﬁ
beauty
ﬂ 
of the scheme isthe Jews paidf or their 
own death.  If there isanything which is m ore ref lecting of the 
d
ep r avi t y
, I don't know if  there is 
one. 
 
>> Leslie Swif t: That's ver y true.  So if  Am ericans know anything about the camp system, they 

know of Auschwit z.  I was surprised when you saidthat Slovak Jews were the first to be sent 

to Auschwitz.  Can you talk
 
a little bitm ore
 
--
 
>> Gideon Frieder:  Am ong thef irst. T hef irst, I think, if I rem em bercorrectly, were the 

Hungarian Jews.  ButSlovakia and Hungary were al ways connected in one way or another.  

Slovakia was part of  the HungarianEmpire bef oreand part of Slovakia was
 
annexedas part of  
the Munich Agreem ent, was annexed to Hungary. 
 

 
Yes, there were
 
--
 
it was very easy.  T here were lists.  So it was easy to f ind them .  
T he country is sm all.  All the locations were known.  Thepolice wascooperating with the 

Nazis.  T hepolice rounded upeverybody.  T here was no questionof undergroundat the tim e.  

Most of theunderground was the Jewish underground. And it was notf ighting underground, 

resisting underground. 
 
>> Leslie Swif t: So in1944, as we heard, there was an uprising against the Germ ans which 

they crushed and youand yourm other and your sisterf led with partisans to the mountains 

only to be attacked by the Germansat a place called Stare Hory.  I'm  probably not 

pronouncing that correctly.  Can you tell ushow that happened? 
 
>> Gideon Frieder: W hat happened was Slovakia is a country
 
--
 
it's  really the breadbasket of  
Czechoslovakia at the tim e.T he north is them ountainous, very beautif ul mountains.  Banska 

B ystrica  is a t th ef oo t of th e e ntry 
to the mountains. W henthe Germans startedtoadvance, 

they were aidedby a large contingent of Ukrainian soldiers collaborating, f ighting, as partof  

the Nazis, the Nazi Arm y.  So it was Germ an and Ukrainianat thetim e in Slovakia. 
 
W hen they 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD

advanced with their arm ors, it was clear thearm or couldnot get into the mountain.  Everybody 
f l ed .   
 
 
Stare Hory is a sm all village in themountainpassf rom  the plains to the mountains.  
T he road there is quite narrow through themountain pass. And we were caugh
t.  T h e 

Germ ans sent some airplanes
a
nd in a classical m ilitary m aneuver,they bom bed theentry, the 
e xi t
;  
ever ybody was caught in them iddle andthey straf ed and bombed everybody.  It was a 
total m assacre. 
 

 
W e were takenf rom BanskaBystrica by a Jewish partisan who was  part of the 
Russian partisanm ovem ent.  He was originall y Polish.  He took us with him.  Hefoundm e 

af ter them assacre. The planes lef t.  Hefoundm e standing next to m y m other and sisterwho 

were killed.  I couldn't raise them.  I was wounded.  Ihad blood onmyself .
 
>> Leslie Swif t: And your sister was 3 yearsold.  Correct? 
 
>> Gideon Frieder:  My sister was 4 years old.  I couldn't raise them . Sohe tookm e and said 

they wil l com e later.  And here is where the story di verges.  
 

 
I r
emember thathetook m e to the village,f rom  them assacre to thevil lage.  A 
m odernpicture. Atthe tim e it was a bitdiff erent. Thehouse ism orem odern looking today 

than it lookedthen. 
 
I rem ember they tookm e from the massacre.  
 
 
Many, m any, many years later I was instrumental in publishing hism em oirs.  He 
survi ved the war.
 
>> L e s lie  S wif t :  T h is  is  He n ry He rzo g.  
 

>> Gideon Frieder:  Henry Adam  Herzog.
 
>> Leslie Swif t: Thepartisan.
 
>> Gideon Frieder: W ho tookm e, yes.  He wrote abook.  I wrote part of the introduction. He 

wrote abook.  Ididall the computer work to publish it. SoI had to read it. And I readabout 

m yself becausehe wrote about me. And much tom y surprise he wr ote that he took mef rom  

the m assacre to the mountains and that 
I was with thef ighting unitfor a whole week.  
Eventually they decided that f ighting in themountains inOctober, in Central Europe, is nota 

placefor a wounded child and they placed me in the village.  That week is totally absentf rom  

m y lif e .  It's n o t
 
there. I was so m uch in shock that it disappeared. 
 
>> Leslie Swif t: So when you talk abouthow your lif e was saved
 
--
 
I would love to hear this 
anecdote
 
--
 
how your li fe was saved by the clothes that you were wearing, is that som ething 
that you readabout inHenry's book? 
 
>> Gideon Frieder:  No, no.
 
>> Leslie Swif t:  You do remember?
 
>> Gideon Frieder:  It's interesting how m em ories work.  I don't remem berfaces.  Idon't 

rem em ber nam es.  I was walking down the street oneday with m y wif e. T here was a
 
yo u ng 
m a n c om i n g a nd  
I said, ﬁHe looksfam iliar.ﬂ  She said, ﬁYeah, it's your son.
ﬂ 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
>> Gideon Frieder:  It's notthat badbut it'sbad.  But I remember any detail you want m e todo
.  

I cantell you about com puters designed in Manchester inthe 1950s, the breakthrough 

com puterand soon.So there's a dichotom y of  what I remember personaland what not. 
 
 
I had an opportunity totalk toa very well
-
kno wn psychiatrist, the head of 
NI H
 
psychiatry so that's som ething. W em et on a personal basis.
  
Andhe told me that certain 
things are etched in your m em ory.  You don'trem em ber things about peoplebecause you lost 

toom any and youdon't want to losem oreby rem em bering them . But the things which happen 

to  
you traumatically

so this I remember v

W hat happened inEurope, small children, small boys, didn't go with long pants. 
T
hat was a sign of maturity. W e went with short pants. But, it's very cold so how do you 
protectf rom cold?  So boys, girls, doesn'tm atter, had very thick, wo olen stockings held by 
garters.  There were no tights at the time. And I hadthose on. W hen I was wounded, I was 

ver y luck y.  Kindof funny to say you are lucky when you are wounded but I was lucky in the 

sensethat no bones were shattered,nom ajor artery
 
was severed, no major nerve was 
severed. T hey were f lesh wounds
; t
ypical to m achine
-
gun f ire
: 
one entry wounds
,  
two  e xit 
wounds.  And whathappened isthe stockings were saturated with blood.  And it was very cold.  

It wa s Octo be
r in them ountains in Eur
ope, Ce
ntral Europe.  It was ver y cold.  And therefore, 
theblood imm ediately coagulated. W hat happened is it created a pressure bandage which we 

do when somebody's wounded.W e put a pressure bandage. So that created the pressure 

bandage and that essentially saved m y lif e; otherwise I would bleed.
 
>> Leslie Swif t: So you
 
--
 
Henry got you
 
to
 
t his  vil la ge .
 
>> Gideon Frieder: T o the village
.  

>> Leslie Swif t: Andf ound afam ily to take you in. As you were sayi ng, your m em ory of  that is 

ver y diff erent f ro
m  
--
 
or your m em ory of  thefam ily and their behavior and their m otivations is 
differentf rom  what Henry had written in the book.
 
>> Gideon Frieder:  Right.  As I rememberedit, hebroughtme to the village.  T hat's adetail.  

But he andhis, quote, partisans, lef tme outside with anotherone ofthem. They were inside 

andtalkedf or I don't know how long.  T henthey broughtm e in.  If elt im mediately wanted. 

T hey tended tom y wo unds.  T hey gave m ea new name
, a
 
Christian Slovak nam e. T hey 
tended to m y wou
nds. They found another Jew hiding in the village who happened to be an 

ophthalm ologist, but a m edical doctor
.  H
e took careof m y wounds as muchas he could.  
T hey f edm e.  And Ifelt caredand wanted.
 
 
W hat Henry wrote in his book is that he cam e with the partisans inside and told 
them  thatthe war is over, practically
; it's a m atte r of time ;
 
thatI am a sonof  a very well
-
known 
personand they should keep m eand returnm eto thefather whenever he wil l com e and that 

they wil l be rewarded
 a
nd if  they don't takeme, they wi ll be killed by him .  Diff icult choice.
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
>> Gideon Frieder: T hat was wr itten there. Ididn'tfeel that.  Ifelt wanted.  I have proof to it.  

I t ' s  n ot  m yf ee l i ng of  a7
-
year
-
old traumatized child.
 
 
I'll take a coupleof m inutes because I think it's im portant.  Many, many, m any years 
later I hadanopportunity to go back to Slovakia.  I couldn't do it after the war.  I was partof the 

Israeli Ministry of  Defense. Slovakia was part of  theSoviet sphereof  influence. T o quo
te th e  

security off icer of m y establishm ent,"f or you to go toSlovakia would be very cheap. You need 

only one
-
way ticket.  They wi ll never let you out."  So I didn't.  Nor could I comm unicate with 
them  because of the position that I have. 
 
 
Af ter the war
 
--
 
after the collapse of the Soviet UnionI decided to go to Slovakia to 
lookf or them . I didn't go im mediately, which is another story which ref lects on the Slovaks but 

it's fo r a no the r time . 
 
W hen I go t the re , Itried  to f in d th em . I couldn't.  Bu t I 
lef t enough 
informationand eventually the daughter of the people who savedm e contacted me. They died 

in
` 
75. And I was there in 1992. 
 
 
W hen I  ge t t he r e

died they gave her what they considered one of  their mostprized possessions,that piec

paper.
 
>> Leslie Swif t: That's amazing.  T hat's am azing. 
 
>> Gideon Frieder: T hat's humanity.
 
>> Leslie Swif t: That's a really beautif ul story.  But they were not able to keep you because all 

of  thistim e you didn't know where your f atherwas or whether he was alive or dead but he did 

return.
 
>> Gideon Frieder:  He did return. W hathappened is Henry Herzog, Adam  Herzog
 
--
 
by the 
wa y, his Hebrew nam e
 
was Adam.  Andm y grandchild
 
is  ca ll
edAdam .  My other grandchild
 
is  
called Gita.
 
>> L e s lie  S wif t :   
For your sister.
 
>> Gideon Frieder:  
F or  m
y sist e r.  
 
 
W hen
ever
 
he
 
m et any Jewish parties or any Jew, he told them  let itbe known that 
the sonof  Rabbi Frieder is in Bully so
-
and
-
so.  My f ather was caught and put in jail before the 
endof  the war but notrecognized.  In jail there was another Jew who told him, "I don't kno
w i f  
you heard, but the son of R
abbi Friederﬂ
 
--
 
not knowing.  So he knew aboutm e.  Eventually he 
f ledf rom  theprisonand found shelter in a Franciscan monastery.  T hem onks knew him by 

reputationand sheltered him until the end of the war. 
 

 
It's kindof  ironicand uplif ting at the same time that ina country governedby a 
Catholic priest who wa s hanged after the war as a war crim inal,a Catholic priest who sold his 

c it ize n s  t o  b e k ille d
, the sam e country otherChristians, the true Christians
,  
saved m e and m y 
father andm any others.  So muchfor what we believe religion is and what is a true religion.  

S o rry.  
 
>> Leslie Swif t: That's wonderfully put. 
 
>> Gideon Frieder:  So he was shelteredby the Franciscan andheknew where I am.  Hesent 

em issariesto takem e.  He died one year after that.  He was 36 years old. 
 
>> Leslie Swif t: So there's a bookbased on yourf ather's diaries that you talked aboutearlier.  

And in it he wrote of  you
 
--
 
he told stories of partisans around them ountains of Jews and 
Russian arm ies.  He talked about the Russian and Germ an soldiers
,  
of  the general whof ell 
prisoner and joined the Germans. He says bitter experiencehad hardened you. 
C
an you 
comm ent on you
r f ather's words? 
 
>> Gideon Frieder: W ell, I can't comm ent aboutm yself .
 
>> Leslie Swif t:  Had hardened yourf ather.
 
>> Gideon Frieder: T he experience hardened everybody.  T here'sam yth that there were 

survi vors.  Our bodiessurvi ved.  You cannotgo throughf iresof  helland come outand say you 

were not touched. It just doesn'thappen. Every one of us was scarred.  Andthose who 

retained their sanity were hardenedand scared.
 
 
I'll tell you just one anecdote.  I'm  part of a group which is writing about the 
Holocaust.  And we have a wonderful, wonderf ulperson who is guiding us.  Sheusually gi ves 

us a sentence and says:  W rite aboutthis sentence,f inish the sentence inf ivem inutes. And 

about a year and ahalf ago
 
--
 
I told you this story but I wanted them to hear it. Abouta year 
anda half  ago the sentence was:  I stopped tof ear when? And you were supposed to writ ef or 

f ive m inutes, continue the sentence.
 
 
T here were about10,or a dozen of us, in the room. W ithoutany coordination, 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

without any
 
prior thought, allof  us simultaneously said " never
, "
  
never stopped.
  
And then we 
looked toeach other because everybody thought it's only him.  You are affectedfor lif e. 
Maybe I was hardened.  I know that itaffected me inother ways. W henI was gro wing up, I 

was cr ying e ver y day until I was 16,every night.  I would wake upevery night cr ying and I 

didn't know wh y.  I didn't have nightm ares.  Ididn'thave dream s.  Iwould just get up crying.  

Eventually by the ageof 16 it stopped.
 
 
T he one thing I decided is that I'll devotem y lif e so it will never happen again.  Now, 
I don't know if  you know ver y m uch about science.  I think youdobut letme repeat it anywa y.  

Science isthe dom ainof  the young
.  A
s opposed to humanities where people write when t
hey 
are older andm oreexperienced in life, in science it'sthe dom ain of the young.  If  youdidn't do 

your m ajor work by the tim e youare45,50, you are done.  If  you look at themajordiscove
ri e s ,  

you wi ll see that 
I  am  r igh t .
  
So I devotedall my life to the security of m y people. And I came to 
this country.  I got a job offer I couldnot ref use.  I cam e to this country only when I realized that 

I didm y shareandthat I'm  aging and that it's tim efor others to takem y place. I did m y share.  

And I can prove it but I won't. 
 

>> Leslie Swif t: W e'll take your word for it. 
 
 
So youm et your wif e in Israel.
 
>> Gideon Frieder:  Im et m y wif e inhigh school.
 
>> Leslie Swif t:  Oh,ok.  Can youtell u
s 
about
 
t ha t ? 
 
>> Gideon Frieder:  People
 
--
 
we were high school sweethearts. Yes.
 
>> Leslie Swif t: That's fantastic. 
 
>> Gideon Frieder:  And we are, by the way, m arried55 years. 
 
 
[Applause]
 
 
T hat just showed
 
--
 
it's endurance. 
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
>> Leslie Swif t:  Ok.  So I think we have timefor af ew questions
. 
>> Gideon Frieder:  Not about m y m arriage.
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
>> Leslie Swif t:  Yes. This isbeing transcribed, so let's
 
--
 
if  you have a question, can you 
please make itas brief and concise as you can and waitf or them icrophone tobehanded to 

yo u .  I wi

Yes, someone will hand you am icrophone.

So your father came back and got you and yet hedied so very young.  It was only a year 
later, youm entioned. Who raised youthen af ter yourf
ather died?  Because you had to have 
been a very young m an thenor a young boy then.
 
>> Gideon Frieder:  I was a young boy.  I was ver y young when hedied. I was 9 years old 

when he died. Af ter the war there was anepidem icof m arriages. People wanted to rebuild 

t h e ir live s
; n
otonly in Europe but also the baby boomer generationand so on. All over the 
world people wanted to rebuild their lif e.  My father was lef t with a sm all child, alone,andwas, 

again, headof  theassociation of the Jewish congregations inSlovakia.  So he was a very busy 

m an.  So he rem arried.  Before he died he swore m y stepmother totakem e, quote, out of this 

bloody continent.  
 
 
Because of his ties to the Jewish underground in pre
-
state Israel, inthe H
o l y 
L
and, 
they arranged fo
r us to come in what we call [Speaking Non
-
EnglishLanguage], the second 
im m igration route. T he British called it illegal. W e, the Jews, don'tbelieve it's illegal f oraJew 

to return to his homeland. So we never called it illegal im m igration. So I cam e there in 1947,

f rom one war to another.  I was raisedand educated in Israel.  Ihad a very diff iculttime to 
acclim ate.  I cam enot knowing the language.  I knew two languages butneither of them was 

spoken in Israel.  It took tim e.  By the time I was 1
6, I wa s a cclima ted .  
 
 
So I was brought to Israel by m y stepm other. She remarried to providefor me.  
Shehad an elder son
 
--
 
she lostherhusbandin the war, in the Holocaust. She rem arriedone 
of  thefam ily m em bers, really, in Israel.  I stayed with them .W e were not very well off  

f inancially.  And I started to work when I was 16. But I went through high school which Ihad to 

p a y a t the  tim e . I we
nt throughuniversity, we nt to doctorate, through the Ministry of  Def ense.  
I dida lotof  very good work on grapef ruit juice.  That was in the Ministry of  Def ense. 
 
>> Leslie Swif t: A question over here?  No, no.  Somebody wi ll bring you a microphone. 
 
>> 
Hi.  I am  just wondering because we heara lotof  stories of  children taken in by gentiles 
a cro ss E u ro
peand it seemedto vary.  Sometim es they're keptf romsight.  I'm  wondering to 
what extent were you able to just live a normal life in this village. W ere you expected to keep 

your identity as a Jew secret? As the sonof a rabbi, were you tryin g to keep any of your 

Jewish sort of  traditions or observances alive? 
 
>> Gideon Frieder: T his is a very good question.  Firstof  all,there'sa book called "
E sca pe ,
" 
which you can get in the library.  It's a very, very sm all booklet about seven children of the 

Ho l
ocaust written for children. Sothe person interviewed seven of  us. T wo of usare here, 

m yself and Helena Peabody.  W eare volunteers here.  Andthe otherf ive aref rom  other 

places in the United States. So you can read it.  
 
 
But to answer your qu estion, when I came to the village,
 
th e
 
f irst thing they toldme 
is thatm y nam e is JanSuche.  Ja
n  i s  a  ve r y 
S lovak
 
name, so is Suche. I hadblueeyes.  At 
the tim eI hadblond hair, or blondish hair.  Idon't look like a Jew.  The name Suche is kind of  

funny
 
because the word, which is a very popular fam ily nam e in Slovakia, really meansdry.  I 
was nothing but dry wh en they broughtm etothatplace.  So they gave m e the nam e. They 

taughtm ehow to behave.  T hey toldm enotto use any other name. They toldm
e not to 
rem ove m y pants. 
 
 
You see,
 
in Europe, the only people 
circum cise
d are
 
Jews.  So it wouldbe enough 
for som ebody to rem ove m y pants to be killed.  SoI never rem ovedm y pants when therewere 

other children.  
 

 
I learned them inim al prayers
 
--
 
le t
 
m e go back one step.
  
In 1944, the Catholics 
usedLatin mass. They didn't pray in the language of  the country. T he only thing
s 
which were 
in the languageof  the country are
 
--
 
there are threethings in the language of  the country.  I bet 
m y bottom  dolla
rs thatthey didn't know thethird one. T hef irst one is The Lord's Prayer, 
ﬁOu r 

F
ather who art in heaven.
ﬂ
  
T hat was in the language of the country, Slovak.  The second was 
ﬁ
Hail Mar y, m other ofGod.
ﬂ
  
And the thirdone that I'm  sure they didn't know was
 
the Apostles™ 
Creed, ﬁIbelieve in Jesus Christ.
ﬂ
  
It'sa very c om plex statem ent. I don't think they knew it.  
 
 
So they taughtm e Hail Mary.  T hough I didn'tknow it at the tim e. I didn't know it 
was T heLord'sPrayer.  It was am antra. Sowhen somebody cam e and said say this, I said it.  

And so did the other children.  Not oneof usknew what we were saying.  T he words were 

blurred into eachother.  T hey didn't know what they were prayin g.  But they saved m y life.  So 

I didn't keep any traditions. I ate what they gave m e which was ver y little but Ihave to say that 

they spared f ood f rom  their own m out
h tofeed me. I was never full.  I
 
was hungry but not 
painfully hungry because they f edm e. Af ter the war I was m alnourished, obviously, but so 

were th
e y.  
 
So they did everything.  
 
 
I have to tell you that in m y assessm ent they were am ong them ost intelligent 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
11
 
people Iever m et. T hey were totally uneducated, totally.  AndI hope you understandthe 
difference betweeneducation and intelligence.  Education isa privil ege.  Intelligence is a gif t.  

And they were gif ted.  So they knew exactly what to do. 
 
 
By the way, the little ham let of nomore than50 people, 50 houses,too sm all to 
even have a chapel
 
--
 
I'm  not talking about achurch. Too sm all to have a chapel. There was 
only a cross in them iddle of the village.  T hat villa ge of  thesedeeply religious saved 10 

different people.
 
>> Leslie Swif t: That's amazing.  I think we have tim efor onem orequestion.  Yes, in theback.  

Holding up the white paper
. 
>> Gideon Frieder:  Ihave a com m itm entat 2:00. 
 
 
Microphone.
 
>> Leslie Swif t:  Yes. Thank you. 
 
>> 
I'm  lo u d.  I'm  a P .E. co a ch.  
 
 
Mr.
 
Frieder, I'm really into the Holocaust
,  
which I know sounds kind of weird.  I read 
ever ything I can geton to it. And Ihavef ound through m y years of reading that it comes in a 

circle.  You know, everybody knows that people got sent to a concentration camp and they 

were starved to death,but itturnsoutthat there's m ore andm oreand more andm ore that's 

invol ved in that. But one thing that Ihave noticed is that survi vors of Holocaust, Holocaust 

survi vors, never want to tell their children what hashappened tothem
 a
nd nine tim es out of  10 
their children have to figure outfor them selves what happens.  I don't under
stand, because 
--
I've never gone through som ething like that
.  
I don't understand why they don't tell their 
children
 b
ecause I f igure 
you 
would want to tell your children so, Godf orbid, nothing else like 
that wouldever happen to any ethnic group in the w
orld. 
 
>> Leslie Swif t: So the question is,f or Gideon, there are som e Holocaust survi vors who don't 

want to tell their children about what happened.  Do youhave any insight as to why that would 

be? 
 
>> Gideon Frieder:  It's a correctobservation. But it's changing.  For m e, the Holocaustdidnot 

exist.  Asf ar as I was concerned, it's not a chapterof m y lif e.  Idated a young girl in high 

schoolforf ive years.  She didn't know anything aboutm e
 f
rom  that point of  view. W e m arried.  
Shedidn't know anything aboutm e.W e hadchildren. They didn't know anything aboutme.  

T henm y unclepublished a book aboutm y f ather.  
 
 
By the way, if  anybody wants a copy of the book, it'soutof print but I can send you 
an electronic version of  it.  It's not pleasure reading but sobe it. 
 
 
W edidn't speak aboutthe Holocaust.  I didn'tspeakaboutthe Holocaust. In1990, 
m y daughter was thenin college.  She cameback and said
, ﬁ
Dad, Iam  responsiblefor the 
Holocaust Memorial Day in m y college.
ﬂ
  I  says,  
ﬁG
reat.
ﬂ  
And she said, 
ﬁA
nd you are the 
speaker.
ﬂ 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
>> Gideon Frieder:  I said, 
ﬁN
oton your lif e.
ﬂ
  
And she said
, ﬁ
W ill
 
yo u
 
do itfor your little 
daughter?
ﬂ
  
W hat could I say? T hat was what opened thef loodgate.  
 
 
Something like that happens to many Holocaust survivors, especially with the 
realization that our num bersare reduced every day and in a very s hort time there will benot 

oneof us to tell the story.  And the Holocaustis starting again. 
 
 
T here was a very wise m an which said,and Iquote
 
--
 
almost quote. I don't know if  I 
can quote exactly.  But he said the Holocaustwas not a childhooddisease;
 
having it didn't 
m ake the world im munef rom  repeating it. And he was right.  If you look around, it's starting 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

again.  But that'sthe story f or 
another m eeting.
 
 
W e,the survi vors, now talk because
 
you areabsolutely right; if
 
we  wi ll n o t  t a lk ,  it 
wi ll repeat again.  
 
 
More than 100 years ago an Am erican philoso
pher by the nam e of  George 
Santay
ana, wrote, and I quote, those which didn't learnf rom
 
history are to repeat it.  It was 
written in hisbook, theage of  reason, som ething with reason.  I can't give you theexact 
publishing title.  He was right.  So we talk
 s
o that you know.
 
 
Oneof  our mostbeloved presidents, President Kennedy, was quoted to say the 
hottest places in hell are reservedf or those who intim e of need kept a neutrality. W e speak 

so that you will not keep your neutrality; that you will be active and that you will prevent it 

because if not, your children will suff er the sam efate thatm y generation
 
d id
. 
 
Sorry.  It's nota pleasant thing to hear but the truth isnotalways pleasant. 
 
>> Leslie Swif t: So we're going to let Gideonhave the last word as is thetradition here in this 

program  but bef ore we do that, I just want to thank youall very m uch for coming.  Ialso want 

to tell youa coupleof things. 
 

 
Gideon will stay f or a few m inutesaf terwards to talk toanyone who wants to com e 
up and speak tohim.  If you could please come up on the stageto do that.  
 
 
Our photographer
,  J oel ,  i s  go i n g t o 
--
 
onceGideonf inishes speaking, I would ask 
you all to stand up so that our photographer,Joel, can geta pictureof  Gideon with you all in 

thebackground.  Andthen that's the sam e reasonto come up on the stage so that Joel can 

cont
inue to take photographs. 
 
 
W ith that I will turn it over to Gideonf orthe last word f ortoday. 
 
>> Gideon Frieder:  Ithink I just told you the last word. 
 

>> Leslie Swif t:  Ok.  Anything else? 
 
>> Gideon Frieder:  History is repeating.  First of all, I would like you to know thateverythin g I 

said here is personal.  I do not representthe 
m
u s eum  a l t ho
ugh theprogram  is done by the 
m
useum .  I don't represent thefoundation which so very generously supports thisprogram all 
of  these years. I representm yself andm y views.  And they do not necessarily representthe 

powers of thism useum .  So that they will not bem ad atm e.T hey usually are. That's ok.  I 

don't like
 
--
 
never m ind.
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
>> Gideon Frieder:  History is repeating.  In 1938the Germ an high comm and
 
--
 
by the way,  I'm  
nota historian. I'm  going to talkabouthistory.  So I don't want youto believe a single word I 

say. W hat I want you to do is to listenandthen verif y.  And if  youf ind that I am  right, do it. 
 

 
In 1938 the Germ an high comm and was ready to overthrow Hitler.  T hey 
considered him  a menace to Germ any.  T hey were right.  T hey didnot proceed with theplans 

they had atthe time because in
 
1938the allied powers of theWest sold out to abloodthirsty 
tyra n t in
 
som ething known as the MunichAgreement.  A statesman came tohis country, 
wa ving a piece of paper saying I achieved peace inour tim e.  He was wrong.  Appeasing a 

tyrant sworn to kill you never works. 
 
 
Look what'shappening today.  Thereare people who swore to kill u
