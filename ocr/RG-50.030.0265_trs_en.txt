HILTGUNT MARGRET ZASSENHAUS 
May 26, 1994 
 
Q: Can you give us your name , a
nd where you were born and when? 
 
A: Yes. I'm H. Margaret Zassenhaus. And the 
"H" is an old German na me , Hiltgunt. Almost 
too difficult. That is why I shortened off. 
And I was born in Ge rmany, in Ha mburg, quite 
a few years ago as you can guess. 
 

Q: What year?  Can you give it to me ?  

 

A: (laughter) Do I have to say this? Yes, 
I was born in 1916. That means really during world 
war number one. And I will tell you my father 
was a rather known educator in Hamburg. 
I had a mother who was just a mother but a mother who I remember as probably the best 
mother ever could be because she really 
would over and over encourage us, have the 
courage to form your own opinion. This is what 
I reme mber when I think of my parents. I 
had three brothers. My ol dest br other, Ha
ns, was a professor, became a professor in 
ma the matics was he in Princeton and in Ameri
ca. And my second brothe
r, Guntra (ph) is 
a physician as I and he lives in California. A
nd then I had a third br
other, who was also a 
physician. He was killed in
 the war, in Germany. 
 

Q: And what was his name? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0265

A: That was Vilfreet (ph), wh
ich means in English will peace. And he was the one who was 
killed in the war. So, we lived in Hamburg. As
 soon as the Nazi's came, my father was . . 
. Three SS (ph) me n came into his office a
nd took him by the arm and led him out. He 
was the head of a very fine school in Ha m
burg where he really ta
ught the liberal ideas 
and the classical ideas of and how people shoul
d live with each other. So, we were very 
grateful to a point that
 at that point he already had Park
inson's disease. So they, for the 
time being, did not arrest him because he 
was a rather known ma n in Hamburg. He had 
written several books about the hi stor y of literatu
re, and so they tried to go light about it. 
So, I can only say almost fortunately soon afte
r the Nazis came, he died, because his fate 

otherwise would have been to be in one ofthe prisons. I had three brothers. My eldest 

brother, my oldest brother, Ha
ns, he was a professor in ma th
ematics. And later as I came 
to America where he was both in Princeton 
and in other universi
ties. And my second 
brother, was physician as I, and lives in Califor
nia. Then I have a th
ird brother, Vilfreet 
(ph) was his name , but really means to will peace. But he was the one who was killed in 

the war. 
 

Q: What was it like as children together
 in your household?  How do you reme mber it? 
 

A: Well, one of my most wonderful me mori
es are those days. And one of my saddest 
me mories is that day when Hitler fi nally came to power. We didn't have televisions, but 

we had the ra dios. And everywhere, even in th
e st reet s, they blared out the Hitler music. 
And I reme mber very well my father. He assemb led us that same  night in 1933. And he 

said, "Look now, you see what has happened. And I want you to know that in our home, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0265  
3 
 
nothing will change. We will have the same 
values. We believe the same thing. We will 
be the same  as we always are." But, he sa
id, "We've got to be extremely careful now 
because we are known." My father was a very
 known educator  in Hambur g. And he said, 
"You must learn to be quiet, not to shout 'H
eil Hitler', but to be
 quiet on the outside 
because this is the only hope we can surv
ive this."  And true enough, the ne xt morning 
several of his SS (ph) men came to our house 
early in the mo rning. They wish to come 
early so that they knew you were there. They 
asked for my father. But my father at that 
time already had a rather advanced case of Parkinson's disease, which really was a 

blessing because they couldn't transport him a
nd they would have had 
all kinds of things 
to get him out there. And since my fath
er was a rather known ma n, a rather known 
educator in Germany, they were a little bit af
raid to begin this, to 
rock the boat too much. 
So, they left him alone. And I can almost say 
since and very soon afte
rwards, he died. So, 
he was spared. But the very same  day after 
that happened, that the Nazis came  to our 
house, I remember too well my father got us al
l together -- us four 
children and a mot her. 
And he said, "Now you see what has happe
ned, what is happening. But in our home 
everythi ng will be the same. On the contrary, 
for now on we will be much more together 
than we ever been before. And I urge you not 
to be afraid." I reme mber that today. "Don't 

be afraid." We were afraid. Because known as
 my parents were in that community, we 
were really very much a target of being a
rrested. And the only reason that my father was 
not arrested because they came . . . At that 
time he was already so far advanced in his 
disease that they just let hi
m alone and said, "Well, he's  dying anyway. He's  gone." So, 
that was the beginning. And I w
ill tell you from there on, we real
ly were about the closest 
knit family you ever have seen or ever have
 experienced. Because we lived in our own 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0265  
4 
 
home . We  had our values as we always had. 
We  could be open with each other. And very 
soon we got a tiny little radio. You see, ma
ny, ma ny years ago, you didn't have all these 
wonderful television and radios. 
You got a tiny little radio. We 
never were very interested 
in radio, but for now on we always start to 
turn. Do you know what we were looking for?  
Finally, one day we found it. The 
radio from London. That was . . . 
 
Q: FromLondon? 

 

A: From London, yes. We  lived in Hambur
g. From London. Finally we got a voice from 
freedom. And from there on really morning, 
noon and night, whenever we had a spare 
mi nute, we listene d to that radi o which gave us the trut h. I never forget that because it 

was almost an obsession. Don't ask me for te
levision because we didn't have it at that 
time. We  ha d only very tiny little radio. So, 
it was not all terrible grief because somehow 
this brought us together. And our
 Jewish friends -- and we ha
d quite a few Jewish friends 
-- we'd gather together. Not anymor e in the da
ytime. We ca me to the m in the dark, after 
night. Or they came to us in the dark of th
e night. And very soon, of course, things got 
very dangerous. I mean, Hitler was very smart. He had a way of fi nding the elite and try 

to decapitate them. It's a n old system of any 
dictator. If you do that, of course, the rest 

will go. And, so, the arrest came at night. And 
I must tell you that my fathe r  not only wa s 
a very known educator, but he had also writ
ten the books about the 
literature (ph) and 
was really known all over Germany. And the N
azis knew that he was quite ill already, so 
they let him be. But I reme mber one day an SS (ph) ma n comi ng to us and he said, "Just 

reme mber you better be very quiet because
 you are observe d." And that we  felt very 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0265  
5 
 
much. But now, none of us has ever been arre
sted. So, we were very fortunate that wa y. 
And now, so, it was very difficult so far because
 what they did indirectly they tried to 
harm us. We  didn't have too much money. To
 study in Germa ny was very expensive. 
This was really a question of 
having money. And what they did is they simply cut out all 
the assi stance, which othe rwise gifted child
ren and people who didn't have all the means 
to study, all this was cut away from us. B
ecause they said, "Well, you are not Nazi. 
You're not in the Party. If you show us good 
will, we will help us." And that good will 
did not come  forth. So, from there on really our house was more or less like a beehive. 
From morning to night -- and 
that started about in '34 -- we had children from all kind of 
schools whom we tutored. And this really 
could get the money for our daily living. 
Because the very same  day when Hitler came  to power, three SR (ph) me n came through 

the house of my father and was to the office 
-- the office school -- and said "this is it", 
and led him out. It was a tremendous fortune 
that they didn't arrest him. We understood 
why they didn't do it. My father was a very known educator all over Germany because he 

had written quite a number of books. And to begi
n this, they went rather lightly on it, of 

the very prominent people. 
 

Q: Was he a known anti-Nazi? 

 

A: He was a known De moc r at. 

 

Q: SocialDemocrat? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0265  
6 
 
A: Yeah -- No, he was the De mocratic Party. He
 was a very religious ma n. My mother was a 
very known Social Democrat. My father 
always called her hi
s left wife, you know?  
(laughter) He was more . . . I think he wa
s a thinker. He was a philosopher. A ma n who 
really stood for political and this kind of 
thing. He was an ethicist, I would say. A ma n 
we admi red greatly. The good this was first he 
was invited out of school. That had to be 
expected because they all knew where he 
stood. But the good thing that he wasn't  
arrest ed was that he, at that 
time , already had Parkinson's disease and was really rather ill. 
So, they left him alone. They even came  one 
day and they said, "Well, at this point, we  
will leave you alone because you are rather known in the community" -- over Germany, 
really, his name  -- "But we warn you. 
We  warn you." With that they left. 
 

Q: Dr. Zassenhaus, you had an incide
nt in school, in high school . . . 
 
A: Yes,yes. 
 

Q: . . . when the Nazis took over. Could you talk about that? 

 

A: Very soon after Hitler came  to power , the new order was passed. For now on, whenever a 
teacher entered the class at the end of six tim
es every day -- different teachers - we ha d 
all to race and then we had to throw our ri
ght arm in the air and 
shout as loud as we 
could, "Heil Hitler". Now don't forget, I was 
at that time  about 15 or 16 years old. I 
imme diately said, "That I can't  do." And I cam
e home  and told my parents about the new 
order. I was very disturbe d a
bout it. I'd look at the faces a
nd hope that they would give 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0265  
7 
 
me some advice. I remember so very much my
 father said, "What will you do?" I said, "I 
will not do it." And he sa id, "Well, are you aw
are of the consequences?" And my mother 
said to me : "Hiltgunt, this is some thing you must
 decide for yourself." I never forgot that. 
And I looked at her, because some how I hoped 
she would give me  some  advice. So, the 
next morning before I left, they asked me
 both, "What have you decided?" And I started 
to cry. I said, "Tell me ." My father said very
 quietly, "You mu st decide this for yourself." 
It was one of the days which were very deci
si ve in my life. I reme mber I co me into 
school. I was on the last bench in school in 
my classroom. All the girls knew about me . 
They knew because not -- I was not very im
portant, but my father was rather known. 
Everybody knew where he stood. And know since 
the order had been passed. Whenever 

the teacher would enter, we would have to 
raise our right arm and 
shout, "Heil Hitler." 
And so the teacher come s in. I stood there, my
 arms glued at my sides. She beckoned me  
to her and she said, "Now as of tomorro
w you will sa y ﬁHeil Hitle
rﬂ and you will raise 
your right arm. I give you 24 hours to think a
bout it." That wa s one of the most upsetting 
days. I came home. I told my parents. I aske
d them, " What am I to 
do?  What shall I do?" 
I never forgot the answer. My mother sai
d, "You must decide for yourself." In the 
evening, I reme mber my father came to my 
bedside and he said, "Are you aware that 
whatever you do mi ght be the end of your educ
ation?" I spent a sleep
less night. I've never 
forgotten it. I still reme mber it as it was 
today. The next day I co
me  to school. All the 
students in my classroom they'r e very eager no
w they all knew about it. My father being 

so known, they wanted to what is she going todo. I reme mb er as today, it was a beautiful 

day in Spring. The windows were open. Everyt
hing was so beautiful outside and inside. 

There was not a decision to ma ke. And don't for get, I was just a very young person, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0265  
8 
 
probably very imma ture. The teacher come s in. 
All the heads, arms 
up. The heads all turn 
to me, what will she do? In my despe r ation, I raised my left arm and I put it right through 
the open window until the glass br oke. Ther
e was a general scream: "What has she 
done?" Blood poured from my ar m. I  was rushed 
to the hospital. That was the end of that 
story. And I must tell you, nobody 
ever looked into my direction. They just left me  alone. 

Some how, a nd as today after so ma ny years,
 I think ma ybe it was very foolish. But 

some how for me  it was the beginning of the 
way I had to go. So ma ny times now I think 
about it. Wh y did I do it? Why not just go along 
with that little?  But,
 no, in retrospect I 
feel that was the decisive mo me nt. I had 
to do what I later would do. The interesting 
thing is for now on, from then on, never anybod
y looked into my direction. They just let 
me  do as odd ball (ph). They said hear 
no nothing, see no nothing. Since then, I passed 
my exa mination. They let me  go to sc
hool so that I could study later on. 
 
Q: Why do you think they . . . Is it because of . . .? 
 

A: Certainly not for me . I think it was because
 of the reputation of
 my father.He was 
hims elf a very know educator in Germany. He
 had written books. Books which are still 
studied and learned about, lear
ned from. And so I think it wasreally more a silent gist -- 
hear no nothing, see no nothing. So, they let me  through. I passed my exa mination -- the 

only way I could to enter university. However, 
my feelings, the feelings of my fa mily, 
were exactly the same . I had the feeling I 
could not live any more in Germany. I would 
not be happy there any more. I just couldn't 
wait any more. So, what I decided is that I 

one day said I have some where to go that is 
next to me . And next to Hamb urg was really 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0265  
9 
 
Denmark. Not far away. About five hours awa
y. This is where I went. This is how I 
started to get interest ed in 
the Scandinavian languages. 
 
Q: And that was the summe r  after high school? 

 

A: The summer after high . . . When after I ha
d my examination, it was really finished. So, 
that began the idea why shouldn't I study Scandina
vian languages. Yes, and that is what I 
did. And that took off. Of course, at the tim
e I had all my examination, my degree. And 
the amazing thing is now in retrospective, ma
ybe really there is some body higher than me  

who leads us  to what we have to do. B
ecause it was an outrage ous idea to study 
Scandinavian languages. It's  very rare, and re
ally not much you coul
d do with it. And my 
parents always asked me , "Is it really what 
you want to do?  What will you really do with 
it? "  Some how I felt . . . I had been there on a 
vi sit that  was a visit that  was a fr ee country. 
I liked that country. There was no Hitler. S
o, here come s the war. Here come  all the 
arrests of the Scandinavi an people because Germany invaded Scandinavia, as you know. 

And, of course, the old principal of Hitler pr
evailed. He always arre
sted the elite of the 
country to decapitate the country. That was 
a very cheap little trick to do, which it 
some how always paralyzed people. So this 
elite now ca me  to . . . I'm jumping now. I 
come now fr om '33 to the war -- to '39. And as
 soon as he invaded Scandinavia, the same  
thing. He goes to the elite. 
Spiritual (ph) elite was arrest
ed. Anybody who resisted Hitler, 
they were arrested. And now they had the 
problem. They got them, brought them to 
concentration camps where people simply were murdered. As you know, as we all know 

here. But they such overflow, and also th
ere was one good thing for the Norwegian and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0265  
10 
 
Danish. They were non-Jews. This idea of 
Hitler -- northern (ph) -- this idea. So, 
somehow that saved them from coming there 
in the concentration camp and being killed. 
They were sent to the prisons. The German 
prisons were no fun either, I can assure you. 
But yet they starved there. They were ill.
 But they were not murdered. And now these 
things where I come  in. They needed now for these prisons some body who spoke the 
Scandinavian languages. And here come s the my
stery of life. Believe it or not I was the 
only person in Germany who had the necessary 
academic degrees for this. That I could 
work at the prisons. Supervise them, se
nd out the ma il (ph), send out anything, any 
outside connection they mi ght 
have. Why would they be sent
 there in the fi rst pl ace?  
Why was no one killed?  See, there was. In 
the prisons, you didn't just kill people. That 
was in the concentration camps. So, they 
needed to do the ac ademic way. And Hitler 
hims elf had to agree that I was the person, 
because I was the only one who had all the 
academic examinations in it. That was ve
ry important for that kind of position. 
 

Q: And was your being a wo ma n an issue? 

 

A: And the problem was of course the anger,
 deep anger of the Nazis. I was not only a 
woma n, I was only a woma n. That was very hard 
for them to swallow as I noticed in the 
years that follows --these f
our numb  years where I know for now on traveled from one 
prison to the other in German whenever ther
e was Scandinavian prisoners. What kind of 
prisoners were they? It wa s the elite of the country, because, as you know so well, Hitler's 

me thod was whenever he invaded another country,
 simply to arrest th
e elite in order to 
decapitate the leadership. It was an old trick I think that's been done for a long time. And 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0265  
11 
 
he did that very skillfully. So, we had the pr
isons and the camps full of the elite of all the 
countries wherever he invaded. And people w
ho resisted, who did anything of resistance. 
If you didn't do anything, you could probably 
get by pretty much. But you can imagine 
the spiritual elite this will always be in the lead
ership if ever it is to be offered. So that is 
how I came into this. 
 

Q: What was the first job that you had? 

 

A: The first job was first they asked me  to come  into a prison camp in Ha mb urg. And then 
they saw, of course, afflue nt in Scandi navi
an languages. I had all my academia. I was the 
only one. That was the aggravating thing. 
There was no other person in Germany who 
had that degree. And the much worse probl
em wa s I was only a woma n. That was very 
hard for Hitler and his people to accept. But st
ill it was sent to Berlin and it took a couple 
of months. These things are always slow, as
 you know. Yes, take her because we have 
nobody else. Now why did they at all allow people into prisons in and out? See, there is 

again the German bureaucracy. You had in
 Germany -- and people usually don't know 
that in this country -- we had two ways of
 i mprisonme nt. The one was the concentration 
camp, which we all know about. That was si
mply, I mean, you were poisoned or you 
were hanged or you were killed. I mea
n, that was death by chance that somebody 
survived, as most of them were killed. But 
in the prisons of Germany there was still a 
system. And there was still the German author
ity who had done it all 
their lives. This was 
done this way and this wa y. And lucky those, the elite, who were shipped off to the 

prisons. Wh y were they shipped off there in
 the first place? Becau
se Hitler had some how 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0265  
12 
 
tend to adore all Norwish Aryan (ph) types.
 I guess it is known 
in this country. And 
some how it must be this. I mean, I cannot fi
nd any explanation. These people more or 
less were shipped off to the prisons. And th
e concentration camps were, of course, so 
filled already by all the countries that somehow
 the Norwish people lived, by this idea of 
Norwish are special. So, that's  really probabl
y saved their life. Now the situation in the 
prisons was awful. However, you did not have
 the Gestapo there. That's  what people 
don't realize. There you still had the old f
unctionaries, the old rules of prisons. The 
people st arve d, they died of illnesses, but they we re not put in the gas chamber. And also 
they had the old order. For example, they c
ould write letters and th
ey coul d also get once 
in awhile a visitor. And see this is where 
I came in. The Scandinavian mi nisters --they 

one day applied in Berlin to Hitler. They want
ed to visit the prisoners fr om time to time. 
And since again the Nazis had some how an adoration of everything which was Norwish 

-- non-Jewish, you know?  Norwish. He said yes,
 fine, they can do that, but only under 
strict supe rvision and only a person who is 
totally accepted and has all the examinations. 
And, believe it or not, the only 
person in all Germany was I who had this fa mous stand. It 
was a fa mous stand. And much to the horror of
 the Nazis, not only did I have this stand 
but I was only a woma n, which was really an 
offense to them. But there you see again the 

German -- what should I say-- 
the stick stick to it. They 
wanted to have done by the 
letters in the prison. From there on for thenext following four years during all the war 

time, I traveled from one  prison to the other.
 What was what I have to do?  I had to send 

out all ma il, which went out and in. Because, 
yes, in the pr isons, the prisoners could send 
letters. But they were, of course, you should st
rike, strike out whatev
er you wanted not to 
be read. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0265  
13 
 
 
Q: You were a censor. 

 

A: Yes. They told me  to strike out as much as possible. Whatever you don't like, you strike 
out. However, I was the only sender there, so 
I was the sender of a sender of myself. So, 
more or less I could really do this. And thatis how it begun. I, little 
by little, only read the 

letter first. I didn't see the people. I only read
 the letter. And when I 
saw that a letter was 
too impersonal, too badly written by a prisoner,
 too much afraid, I pu
t some  things in. I 
put some  little notes by myself. This and this, 
and everythi ng is alright, don't worry. I put 
that in. Of course, not in my
 own ha ndwriting. I tried, at l
east, to do other hand writing. 
So, little by little. And then, of
 course, the good thing was I again had to send out also 
what came back. So that I struck out. So, 
I mean, it was very good. That went about 
almost a year. Then came the idea about ther
e in the prison. Any prisoner is allowed to 
have so ma ny visitors. 
 
Q: Could we go back for a mome nt? 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: Wasn't  there, before you were doing those le
tters, at some  point you were given a special 
assignment to get the letters fr
om the ghettos that were going? 
 

A: Yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0265  
14 
 
 
Q: Can you explain what you did? 

 

A: That happened . . . since I had this examin
ation, I was hired for the censorship between 
Germany and Scandinavia. Both Denmark, 
Norway and, not Sweden -- Denmark and 
Norway. And so whatever I did not like, 
I found objectionably, I could strike out. You 
see?  And so what I used to dr
aw in the course of years -- 
not right a way of
 course -- but 
later on when I was feeding the Scandinavian 
prisoners, I'd send little notes to them a nd 
let them know what was going on. Because I wa
s the only one who sent out these letters. 

And that is the letters between the prisoners
 and the relatives. So I could do this. For 
example, it was very important for me  to give them one me ssage which was very 

harmless but of most i mportant, most importa
nt. These prisoners really were starving to 
death. But since they were in prison, there wa
s one rule. They could get every six months 
a peso (ph). And in that peso
 (ph), they could have some  
chocolate, some thing to eat. 
What you say oh what does it mean every six m
onths?  We ll, it was two pesos (ph) a year. 
It was some  little light. And so what I did in 
my letters going to them with a thick (ph)  
hiding my own writing, I put to each "send pe
sos (ph), send pe sos (ph)". Because the 
relatives didn't  even know that, of course, that  they could send pesos (ph). And very little, 

very fast where it goes. It t
ook about three, four months. Th
e first pesos (ph) arrived. The 
authorities were furious. They were furious
 because it was work to them. Why should 
we? But it was a rule. In these prisons there wa
s rule they could have a peso (ph) twice a 
year.

Q: So, were you supposed to cross out . . . 
 

A: Exactly. 

 

Q: . . . if a prisoner asked for something, you were supposed to cross it out. 

 

A: That was the rule, idea now. I was asked whenever they would say send food, I should 
simply cross it out. The good thing was that I se
nt out the letters. 
Very soon, of course, 
I'm sure they were told you must not even as
k for it, because it was not anywhere in it. 
But I would scribble it myself, "send food", 
in the letters. "Send food", you know, with a 
different handwriting of myself. It was reac
hing them and so the pesos (ph) kept on 
arriving. The authorities were furious and they
 came to me a nd complained. I said, well 

this is really unheard of, but if I were you a 
rule is a rule. Do you want to break a rule?  
That's fine by me . I don't mi nd. But it's your 
responsibility, of course. And, yeah, no we 
cannot break a rule. We  have to give it to th
em. So, they got these pesos (ph). That was 
one good thing. They kept on hiding. Mind you, 
we had two systems in Germany under 
the Nazis. That's very hard for people 
to understand. One was a concentration camp 
where people simply were gassed or killed or
 starved. But the other was still a system 
with certain rules. This is where I had come
 in, fortunately, and could really do my part. 
 

Q: How did you come  to think of doing this? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0265  
16 
 
A: Well, that wa s very interesting. I had 
studied Scandinavian  languages. I loved 
Scandinavia. 
 
Q: No, no, no. I don't mean that. I mean you we
re adding things. This was dangerous for 
you. 
 

A: Certainly it was dangerous for me . But you s
ee, I was the only one who sent that . . . I 
was really in charge of the w
hole ma il. And so the only thing I 
had to fear, of course, that 
some body e ventually would get the good idea to
 send the ma il again. But they never did 
that. See, they were not 
all that smart as you think. 
 

Q: Were you in a room alone? 

 
A: See, no, I put the letters fr om the 
prisoners ma iled dire
ctly to my home . 
 
Q: To your home. 

 

A: To my home . And then from my home, I ma
iled them back to the prison, and then they 
were ma iled by postage over to Denmark and No
rway. But they also had to pass them the 
censorship. See, the ordinary censorship. But 
they again didn't  know the rules of the 
prisons, you see. So we had two forces 
working against each other, and it worked 
ma rvelously. So, I was tremendous in hiding in 
different handwriting so that I had to be 

very careful because, you see, there were 
some people that might pick that up. But it 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0265  
17 
 
worked. Amazingly, it worked. This went on fo
r years. That was one way I could help 
them. But very soon fate came to me in th
e form that the counsels and the people in 
Scandinavia, the authorities, they started to 
talk with the German Nazis in Berlin. They 
said, "Look, this is a prison our
 people are in. Wh y can't  they 
have visit from us? "  And so 
they asked at last, "Who is us? "  They sai
d, "Well say, for example, two ministers could 
come . Two people who are appointed by us." Th
ey said, "Yes, we accept it. That will be 
alright." Because it was a prison. It was not
 a concentration camp, you se e. That was a 
rule. In Germany, a rule is a rule. They sai
d, "But then we will have to have some body 
who supervises these visits ag
ain who is on our side." And this some how, of course, had 
to know Scandinavian languages, had to be
 fluent in Norwegian and Danish. And, you 
know, in Germany, again, it was . . . that 
was not enough. There were ma ny people who 
spoke Danish and Norwegian, but you had to have the academic exa mination, a 
doctorate, the whole thing. And 
here I really can only tha
nk God interfered. I was the 
only person in Germany who had that exam
ination. And I was only a woman. That was 
very diffi cult to swallow for the authorities,
 but they had no choice. The order had come  
from Berlin. Yes, that would be alright 
now. Because it was a prison, it was not a 
concentration camp. And from there on, for th
e following years and years and years, I 
would be the person totally in 
charge of the ma iling, of the 
censorship, and of any visit 
they would get. Now they would have to 
find people who would visit them. There was a 
good thing that in Hamb urg -- Hamb urg is a s
eaport, of course. We  had always had a 
Norwegian and Danish pastor as evident. B
ecause  he was there not for prisoners, but he  

was sent for the sailors, for the Norwegian 
and Da nish sailors. So, the news idea came  
from Scandinavia. Why don't we try to get 
these pastors there?  And so this happened. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0265  
18 
 
One day, I get the visit of a Norwegian and of a Danish pastor. They identified 
themselves. They said to me , " We have go
tten our permission." It took them about 
months and months, of course. But we have
 got the permission from the prisons in 
Ha mburg that we can visit the prisoner if you 
would be willing to ta
ke the censorship of 
the letters and of our visits.And I said, "This is fine. That
 can be done." I said, "But I 
have to see how far this goes in my". And 
so I contacted the authorities, the German 
authorities, and was very angry and said, "Now
 here's  another work I have to do, and how 
would that work because I have soon had 
enough of it all." And anyway I put my words 

in a way that they started to beg (ph). They said, "Well, an order is an order, and you'r e 

the only person who can do it. Couldn't  you pl
ease help us out?" I said, "Well, I don't 

really will so, but I will do it. 
It will be my duty." I said, "I
f that is what  the authorities 
want, I will do it." That was 
where it started. From there on now, we had everything the 
way we wanted it. To begin with, it was ve
ry amusing because these two pastors . . . 
understand that these are two mi nisters very 
afraid of me . And they mi strusted me . I 

could very well understood this
. But it took about, I would say, 35 mi nutes, and they 
began to feel (laughter) . . . they began to 
feel that this was alright. From there on we 
started to do our work the fo
llowing four years about. We  tr
aveled first in Ha mburg. We 

saw fi rst in Hamburg the prisons. But little 
by little, the pr isons were filled all the 

political prisoners from Scandinavia. Then 
we got the bombs. We  got prisons that were 
bombed out. Little by little, they were allremoved into all kinds of parts in Germany, 

away from where the main attacks were. And 
so there it started now that we would have 
to travel from one prison to the other in
 the following years. Officially, I was the 
supervisor of these two pastors who visited th
e prisoners. I wa s to, of course, ma ke sure 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0265  
19 
 
that nothing was said which was not allowed. 
I had to do censorship of all their ma il, all 
their contacts between Denmark and Norway 
and the prisons. Of course, I was in total 
charge that nothing was done wh
ich was a... So, this started the work which now then 
followed in the four years. I was very happy to 
say that I did it my way. I did it frankly in 
a way that my two pastors were some ti me s 
very angry and felt I took too ma ny chances. 
They said one day very angry, "We can't  
go along with it any more. You do too much. 
First you lose your head and what happens 
then?" They were, of course, I could 
understand, they were afraid for their life. I ne
ver forgot that mome nt
. I looked at the two 
of them and I said: "You know, 
I must tell you. I would rather lose my head than my 
heart." And so that's a tune (ph) for there on. 
I'm happy to say that they will not die, that 
maybe soon I can say at that time I did all th
at was necessary and what could be done. It 
still ma kes me  very, very happy. 
 
Q: Can you describe to us speci
fically, when you first went into
 the prison in Ha mburg with 
the mi nisters, how did you begin to think a
bout the things you could do?  Because you 
begin to bring in things to the prisoners that were . . . 
 
A: You know it was obvious from the letters they 
wrote that they would instruct their wives 
not to write anything. But you begin to read
 between lines when you read ma ny letters. 
You know, I read thousands and 
thousands of letters in the 
following years. I could see 
what enormous need they were in. They 
were starving. They were simply starving. I 
mean, they got mi ni ma l rations which was
-- how do you describe?  I mean, the lunch I 
just had would have been two full days of nour
ishment. I me a n, it was just -- it was very 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0265  
20 
 
hard to describe. They we re all, of course
, emaciated (ph) people who saw them and who 
once in awhile had ma ybe a commiss i on to se
e them where they barely could recognize 
them. They were like muscle (ph) men, we cal
led them. I me an, it's hard to describe. But 
I could see that was the fi rst thing. They need
ed some thing which would keep them alive. 
To begin, I had only my  bag. You know?  I alwa
ys ma de sure that I had a big bag, like 
this bag back here. I started with vitami n tablet
s. I thought that is easy to put in the bag. 
Now my two mi nisters could not
 have done anything who visite
d. You see, they were the 
one who had gotten the permission to visit on
ce in awhile, because it was still prison. 
There was a still a certain orde
r and aggravation. They couldn
't  do this, and they didn't  
want to do it. They were probably very afra
id. I could very well understand it. And so 
what I did was really my own risk. I felt I need
ed to do this. So, I started with this. And in 
this bag, what could I do?  We  saw on a day ma
ybe 30, 40 prisoners. Very little, very little 
you could have in such a bag. Little by little
, I got a very good idea. Then about on the 
second month, my goodness, we have all these 
terrible air raids in Hambur g. I have to 
think for my self. I have to carry around all 
I belong. So, I start firs
t with a little handbag. 
And they looked, the authorities. 
And they said, "Well, what is 
that?" I said, "That is all I 
have." "How do you mean? "  "Because we tr
avel now over all Germany." I said, "If a 
bomb comes, if I'm bombed out, that is th
e only thing I have." And wouldn't you think 
that they would have done the bright 
idea and sa id wouldn't you open it. Because 
everybody else who entered and left had to open. However, they came to think I was 

appointed by the highest authorities in Berlin. 
And I always, of course, 
very leisurely said  
I'm so and s o. They all knew it. They were
 afraid of me . So, nobody ever in all these 
years asked me  just once, "open it". By the 
grace of God. I think there was again the idea 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0265  
21 
 
of authority. Very often they looked at me  
and I knew exactly what they thought. I would 
have thought the same . They would think how
 is it possible that she can do all these 
things. Come in and out, and especially I 
was only a woma n. That was very hard to 
perceive. I think that was the savi ng grace because
 I could read it. They thought if that is 
really a woma n only, there must be very specia
l with her. She must be special. So, more 
or less, I think they thought 
I was over and beyond the Gestapo. And, believe it or not, in 
all these years this worked and was really
 I can always say by
 the grace of God. 
 
Q: Where did you get the vitami ns from? 

 

A: Now, of course, I knew the first thing to do 
is what can you do in the luggage which is of 
greatest importance. And I felt these people were
 starving. I wish I could have afford to 
give them bread or anything, but the most
 important thing was some thing which was 
small and which could give some  general strength. So I needed now vitami ns. Now I 

went around begging for vitami ns. There were not much vitami ns because everybody 

needed vitami ns. Everybody was in a very depl
orable situation. I mean, Germany itself as 
the years went by, really had not muc h to eat
. But nothing which could be compared with 
the mi serable shape in the prisons. So, little by 
little, I said in the letters, who I send them 
myself. I was the authority. I said send parc
els (ph), send vitami ns
. "Send vitami ns" -- I 
put that and scribbled that in. And not long 
the settings came in. Came  in, came in, came  
in. Then I said again, I want to be in charge 
of these parcels. And si
nce I was in charge  of 
the whole thing, they . . . . So, we had th
e vitami ns. What they couldn't send, I got 
through my underground in Germany, which, of course, by that time also built up. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0265  
22 
 
 
Q: Now is this Mr. Jenkins? 

 

A: It was Mr. Jenkins. You see,
 I left in Ha mburg. Hamburg is a posh town, which is very 
good because all the Dani sh and Norwegian moved. They had to come  to Ha mburg and 

deliver the me rchandise. And they had a 
man there. I had met a captain there by 
circumstances who was in charge of thes
e boats and loading. And so very soon I 
developed a very hearty friendship with this
 ma n and I think he knew exactly what was 
going on, but he was a good ma n. He was a 
German. A very good ma n. So, we never 
spoke about what we did. But we did it in sile
nce. He brought me  the things I needed. He 
came whene ver I wanted to help and he gave it to me . 
 

Q: Did you ask him for vitami ns?  
 
A: I told hi m that I needed vitami ns for my
self. I said, "You see, I'm only woma n. I have a 
very important job." I told him, "I have to de
al with the Scandinavian prisoners. I have to 
keep my strength up." He didn't say, he didn'
t ma ke a comment , but at the end of our 
conversation -- I never forgot it. He got up 
and he said, "You know you're  really a very 
tiny person. But I think you need a lot of th
em." I looked him straight in the face and 
said, "And a lot, and a lot." And he said, "I
 will reme mber." From there on, I got all the 
deliveries. It was really wonde
rful. It all was some how . . 
. I must tell you, I'm not a 
person that goes to church. You know, people ar
e different. But I began to believe that 
help is given. Where you really pray for help
 or you want to help or you really wanted 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0265  
23 
 
this all your help. Because I can only say I c
ould not have done all this work alone. Help 
was given tome . And there came in these vita
mi ns by the mos t  wonderful circumstances. 
It would take much too long he
re to tell you. I was never runni
ng out of vitami ns. Even if 
I wrote my brothers, who were now as physicians
 in the army, sent me  vitami ns. "I need 
vitami ns. I am very hungry." They knew, of c
ourse, what I meant (laughter). And so I got 
them from everywhere. Help was given. I ne
ver ran out of it. A
nd that would some how 
help these people. 
 
Q: Did you get me dicine as 
well from this doctor . . . 

 

A: Of course, little by little also the me dici
ne. There was no me dicine
, certainly not for the 
prisons. I began to collect me dicine. I had 
our own doctor. Our own physician was a ma n, 

a very right-winged German, very -- how shoul
d I say Œpatalotic (ph), and yet he was a 
huma n being. I mean, I could see what the Nazi
s did, he felt. You se
e, there was still a 
little di fferent being a patalotic(ph) Germa
n, but  being a Nazi. There was a little bit 
difference. 
 

Q: This was in Ha mburg? 

 

A: That was in Ha mburg, yes. 

 

Q: Von . . . 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0265  
24 
 
A: Dr. Vonburg (ph). And so I went one day to
 him and I said, "Look, I need your help." I 
reme mber this today. He said to me, "I thi
nk you need help. You look 
very pale." I said, 
"This is precisely why I come  to you. I feel al
l starving." It was very difficult. I mean, all 
throughout the German because ther
e really not much to eat. But, "I need vitami ns. I need 
vitami ns very much in order to keep my job up. I need a lot of help." He said, "What 
would help this? "  I said, "Well, to give you 
some  idea, I work for people who need help, 
who are very much in help." And he said, "What 
is it?" I said, "Well, very sick at work. I 
would rather not speak about it. 
So, please allow me  not to speak
 at all. But I need help." 
And from there on, I will say this wonderful  ma n gave me  . . . he could do it as a 

physician. At that time, I was not a physician. 
I was the linguist. I got all the vitami ns I 
needed. The wonderful thing was, I went with 
this heavy luggage in 
and out of prisons. 
The prevalent regional Danish from, he coul
dn't understand what I did. And the people at 
the prison asked my, " W hy do you have all th
is luggage? "  I said, "Look here. I come  
from Ha mburg. This is all I have. That's all 
my possessions." They ne
ver dared to ask me  
to open the luggage. Do you know why?  Because they were so afraid of me  because I had 

a rather high position. And I also
 once in awhile said, "See Hitler, as he's  asked me  to do 
all these things." They were 
afraid of me . That was the r
eason that we could be alone 
with the prisoners. Usually, if you ever have
 been in a prison, you 
are never alone with 
the prisoner. I don't know how it is here, but 
in Germany it would be there would always 
be a man in there to superv
ise -- a guard. But I always said, "Look here. I don't want a 
guard. I'm the guard." The only thing they n
eeded to do is one day to say open your 
luggage, and it all would have come  out. Bu
t they never dared to
 ask the question. 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0265  
25 
 
Q: Did you see the prisoners one by one, 
or did a group come  in and see you? 
 
A: I tried to do it by groups because, see, in 
Hambur g I had 800 prisoners. In order to cover 
as ma ny people as possible, I always tried to 
have four, five, six people at the same  time. 

See, there is a mi racle of the human heart. The 
mi racle. I call it the mi
racle. None of these 
people ever revealed me . See, if only one 
of them had said some thing -- one of the 
prisoners -- they would have had some. They would have gotten more bread. They would 

have gotten some  things, some  reward. None 
of them. See, and that in a time when I 
believed in the human he art was almo st nothing
 anymore, that restored my  belief. That 
these people in the gr eatest need they were, 
they knew exactly why I did it and they knew 
that this had to go on. Of course, don't forg
et these people were not criminals. These 
people were the elite of Scandinavia who had b
een arrest ed solely for the reason that they 
had been brave enough to try to
 lift Hitler's regime
. But I will say st ill people who were 
starving, who . . . hopefully you've never star
ved. People who really starve -- I had 
learned that in my own life Œ it takes a tr
emendous ethical way of being and thinking. 
That you don't almost do anything just for a pi
ece of bread. I learned 
that in my life how 
diffi cult it is -- what st arvation really mean
s. So I will say this 
experience with my 
prisoners, my 800 prisoners, which little by li
ttle I had to deal 
with, that nobody ever 
revealed on me . Why I 'm sure that particul
ar prisoner who would have done that would 
have been emptied the water (ph). That have
 really restor ed my belief in the human 
being. A belief which had been always distor
ted by the Nazis and by the things I had to 
fear in my life. And whe never I ha ve mo me
nts where I'm still sad about the human heart 
and what people can do, I think of that. I think that was 
for me the greatest reward. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0265  
26 
 
 
Q: Did you get to know some  of th
ese prisoners better than others? 
 

A: Oh, they became  my fa mily. All of them. 
All 800. They became  my fa mi l y. They became  
my friends. I loved them. I became for them, you know, I think really, it was for them, 

that was there home. Tha t  was all they had. 
Don't  you see that went on over four years. 
The hardest mome nt was to part because there 
the one day in the mi ddle of the night, and 
all shipped back to Scandinavia. The best we
 could hope for. They were not gassed. They 
were not killed. And so now it started. They
 became  extre mely for me . I reme mber one 
day shortly after the war, a ma n totally knocke
d at our door. One of the great mo me nts of 
my life. We  opened and he said, "I'm comi ng 
for Hiltgunt." He said in Norwegian. I said, 
"Are you? "  He said, "I am. Bu
t, I'm not one of your prisoner
s," he said. "But they sent 
me . They want you to know that they have 
not forgotten you and th
at we try everything 
possible that we can come in contact with you. 
And so it took about one
 and a half years. 
I mean, Germany was really hermetically s
ealed. But little by little, the fi rst pastor s 
arrived, it was so beautiful. And little by little
, the first people arri
ved in uniforms , and 
English uniforms and American uniforms, whate v
er they could get a hold of. My for mer 
prisoners came. 
 

Q: So they came. 

 

A: They came to visit me after the war, you 
see. It wa s very beautiful. So the British 
authority, they were very strict, of course
. They didn't know even of what's  going on. But 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0265  
27 
 
they very soon came and told them all about
 it. And so the connection was there. Not 
long afterwards, I was given the official invi
tation to both Denmark and Norway to visit 
them on our official state visit.
 It was one of the great mo me nts of my life when I arrived 
there and in front all the prisoners who had su
rvived. It's one of the great mome nts of my 
life. 
 

Q: And you received the me dal . . . ? 

 

A: Yes. I received these decorations. I wa s ve
ry happy about. But, the greatest decoration 
was really that I could get them out alive. That was some thing so wonderful a feeling. 

Yet I was very grateful for all the honors later that came. But the importance was really 

that I could do when it was needed. And I th
ink that we need to reme mbe r  now how 
much we huma n owe to each other. I think 
some times we forget that because now we 
have times, of course, where we have relativ
ely comfortable situations. We have no wars 
going on, or big wars. But I think 
we must never forget what we
 as individuals can really 
do for each other. So often, for example, in th
is country, I hear that they should do this 
and they should do that. "They" meaning 
this unknown authority, 
whoever. And each 
time I cannot but say who is "they"?  Well, 
that authority. We ll don't you think it's a good 
idea to ask myself what I coul
d do?  And so little 
by little, of course, when the things -- 
when I wrote my book, "Walls"(ph), and when
 things got known, the universities got 
very interested in, to hear about it more. A
nd so I now since several years that you mi ght 
know have been traveling fromone university to the next. Th
ey wanted to find out what 
really was happening at that 
time. And more and more, they
 also ask the question, why 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0265  
28 
 
would you do it?  Why would you have taken the ri
sk?  It ma kes me  always a little bit sad. 
And I look at them and say, "Why should I 
not have done it? What would you have 

done?" And some ti me s the answer is silence. A
nd I don't resent that because that is really 
the question each of us has ask yourself. If 
you come  in such a situation, what would you 
do?  I mean, this is some body can decide that
 for you. What ma kes me  sa d, I must tell you 
this, is how today in our community of peopl
e how often I hear these kind of things. 
Well, those Jews or those blacks and those th
is and those that. Ho
w much of prejudices 
we still have. I think in ma ny ways, the war 
is still going on. It's my prayer, now I'm old, 
that we begin to learn that the human conditi
on is really one we all have in common. And 
before we don't fully understand it-- yes, befo
re we don't fully understand it -- there will 
always be the possibility of a
nother Hitler. And that is rea
lly my prayer, if I have any 
prayer left, that we begin to  understand that the huma n conditi
on is that what we all have 
in common. And if we fully understand this
, and I'm proud to say that in this 
environment. If we begin fully to understand it,
 then I think there is hope for this troubled 
world.

Q: Dr. Zassenhaus, can you describe your fa
mily life with your brothers and your parents 
and how they raised you, and with 
what values they raised you? 
 

A: Yes. I must tell you that my father had studi
ed religious literature 
and history. He was an 
educator  and very soon became the head ofa rather prestigious school in Ha mburg, in 

Germany, where he also taught a 
little bit. He taught mostly
 ethics and literature. My 
mother was a free spirit, which you can see in 
those days this was very unusual. Already 

with age 15, she moved into a
nother city because she came  fr
om a very small city, where 
she was a the first woma n in Germany took he
r full education, her full degree in school, 
which was very unusual at that time . Fortunate
ly, she me t there the head of that school 

and fell in love with him. A
nd that became my father. So they ma rried. She never went to 
the university, which she actually had wanted to
 do. Don't forget, it was a different time. 

My father very soon was called to Ha mburg to
 a very prestigious school there where he 
became the head. Not only that, he also taught
 hi story and religion, 
and wrote the history 
of Ger many, which became  a very important bo
ok and it™s still read in the universities in 
schools in Ge rmany. So that was a background I 
had. I would say the id
eas of Hitler were 
as far from our fa mily as the moon. And I re
me mber so very well the very day, the 30th 
of January, when suddenly now through all the 
loud speakers -- televisions we didn't have 
at that time . Loudspeakers came "the Fuhrer
 has the power. Adolf Hitler ha s come  to 
power." It wa s to us almost as some body shook 
us and said "the whole house is on fire". 
We didn't know. Especially we were four 
children. I had three br
others, all one year 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0265  
30 
 
apart, and I was the young sister. When my br
other studied at the university, I was still 
going to school. I reme mber as it had been 
today, although it was, 
I think, 200 years ago. 
Our parents assembled us all together at 
the table and my father said, "From now on, 
things will be different. Ev
erything has changed." And my 
mother added, "But one thing 
rema ins the same . In our house, everything will
 be  same . We  will be now one fa mily who 
totally stands together. But this house ha
s to become  a fortress. Whatever you say 
outside, it has to be mainly in silence because
 some how we have to try to survive." And 
very well the next day we  found out what she 
me ant with it. I woke up to a total dark 
room, although it was a light day. I could not
 know what had happened. I saw at the 
windows and a hush through the whole house. And I saw all our windows were sealed 
with swastikas, with pape r, and darkened by 
that. Because my father was a rather known 
educator in Germany who had 
written books about education a
nd so they wanted to show 
us now what had happened. And if we didn'
t know, my father, of course, immediately 
was without a job. He was the head of the schoo
l. At that time, he 
was already quite ill. 
He had Parkinson's disease in a rather progr
essed shape already. And I think that really 
saved his life. He was so well-known a person th
at to begin with, the 
Nazis more or less 
tried to tread lightly. And so they let hi m be at home and let him die in peace. A couple of 

months later, he was dead. And now here my
 mot her was with f
our children. I was the 
youngest. I was about 16 or 17 years old. I re
me mber my first school day. The teacher, a 
wonderful teacher whom I ador
ed, she taught us history. She came  into our class. She 
was very pale. That is what I noticed imme di
ately. And she said, "Well girls, I must tell 
you from now on everything will be  different. A
nd the first thing I will tell you from now 
on whenever a teacher enters the class, you a
ll have to get up. You have to raise your 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0265  
31 
 
right arm and have to shout as  loud as possible 'H eil Hitler'. 
That's the way it will be." I 
knew her well enough. I saw the tears in her ey
es. I was disturbed by it. Why would she 
even tell us that?  How could she tell us?  
I came home. I was very upset. I told my 
parents. I saw they became  very silent. A
nd somewhat later, they came to meant they 
said, "Well, what will you do?" And I said, "W
ell, what am I to do?  What do you think I 
should do?  Give me advice. I cannot raise my 
right arm. I will not do this kind of thing." 
And they said, "Well, I think we will a
ll think about it some how." And so the next 
morning before I went to school, they came ag
ain to meant they said, "Now what have 
you decided?" And I said, with tears in my eyes, "What do you think I should do? "  I wa s 
desperate. It was probably one of the really 
most desperate days of my life, because my 
father looked very seriously at me  and he 
said, "Hiltgunt, you must decide  for yourself." 
Totally in that mo ment, it was the fi rst time th
at I really felt ve ry alone. So, I come  to 
school and I had my pla ce at the window. It
 was a wonderful day in spring. That was 
about when this orde r had been passed. Simply for now on should all raise our and place 

our arm "hail Hitler". The teacher enters 
the classroom, the windows were open. Now all 

these girls stood straight, raisi
ng their right arm. Curious as 
they were and as much as 
these little gi rls were, they knew where I st ood. 
The heads all were bent  to me. What will 
she do?  And in my desperation, I took my
 left arm and I threw it through the open 
window! The glass fell, blood fell from my ar m!
 Here you see still th
e scar. (laughter) I 
was rushed to the hospital to be sewed up. And 
I must tell you, I sti
ll consider it the scar 
of my honor . And from now on, I will tell you, 
nobody ever looked in my  direction. They 
simply left me  alone. And I stood there alone
 some  down there and thought, well, we ll, 
but they didn't  say anything, and just did not
hing. Really it was by the grace of God, or 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0265  
32 
 
ma ybe rather by the doubtless respect they 
had for my father who was really a known 
educator, that they simp ly overlooked me . They 
let me  be. That was really the reason that 
I still was allowed to rema in in school, that 
they simply ignored me . That was the best 
they could. The other wa y they would have si
mp ly would have to tell the Gestapo. They 
didn't do that, thanks to the reputation of my
 father. I passed my exa mination and I was 
on my own. 
 
Q: Tell me , before that incident happened, youwere given an assignment to go to a Hitler 
rally. This is before January 30 . . . 
 

A: That was before January 30. That was before all this happened, before Hitler came  to 
power. I went there and I was . . . I'd never 
been to such an assembly. Hearing these 
people scream like absolutely ma d. Seeing this 
man . . . I mean, like I had fear but also I 
had to laugh. I mean, it was almost as you have seen a clown. And so I came home  and 

the next day . . . 
 

Q: Did you talk with your parents when you came home ?  

 

A: I talked with my parents. I was totally . . 
. I couldn't  believe it. My parents tried to calm 
me  down be cause here I was a very y
oung. I think 15 or 17 years old. I couldn't 
understand what was happening. My father said, "What will you do?" I said, "What can I 

do?" I asked my parents. And I reme mber that 
my mother said, "You must decide that for 
yourself." And for the same  ti me , I reme mber this. Suddenly this feeling of total 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0265  
33 
 
loneliness. Fi nally, nobody could give me  a
dvice. My mother said to me , "You must 
really decide  which way you will go from now."
 And the next day, I reme mber we were 
told now that for now we should raise our right arm. 
 
Q: But you wrote an essay. 
Didn't you write an essay? 
 

A: Yes. I wrote . . . 

 

Q: What did you write in this essay? 

 

A: I wrote the essay about Hitler. I remember I 
closed with the words "Hitler is psychotic." 
With all the rest of my 17 years. And onl
y two days passed and I saw my t e acher comi ng 
very pale tome . And she said, 
"Take this back. Take this ba
ck and tear it apart." And I 
said, "Why? That is what I mean." And she looked at me , "Can't  you see what you're 

doing to me , and what you're going to do to you?" And so she just simply didn't want 

anything to do with it. Now, of course, 
being a much older person, I understand. But I 
couldn't understand this at that time . Then 
when the order was passed that for now on 

whenever the teacher entered the class and fo
r each class, we would all shout together 
and raise our right arm and shout
 "Heil Hitler". I came home. I 
came  very upset. I told my 
parents about it. And I saw how serious they
 looked. Give me  advice. What can I do? 
What shall I do?  I will not do this. And I neve
r forgot, my mother said, "You must decide 
that for yourself." That was a mo me nt I felt ve
ry lonesome . So the next day arrived and I 
had to go to school. The school gi
rls in the class then knew, of
 course, from before where 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0265  
34 
 
we stood, and what I would do. The teacher come s 
into the class. She had told me  the day 
before, "Hiltgunt, don't ma ke it too difficult for 
me . Just think now." She was a very dear 
teacher. "Don't  ma ke this difficult." And she had sa id, "Don't ma ke it too difficult for 
yourself." And so I stood there and all the ey
es of the class were on me  because they 
knew that this was going on. Would I break?  Wo
uld I give in?  And I reme mber the words 

of my father, "Do you re
alize that you can dest
roy all your future if 
you don't give in?" In 
my desperation, when she come s in, all these 
girls raise their right
 arm and shout, "Heil 
Hitler", I take  my left arm and threw 
it right through the open window! Glass was 
breaking, blood was pouring from the arm!  (laugh
ter) I was rushed to the doctor. I had to 
be sewed up. And I will tell you, this scar I 
still ha ve now. I call it really the most 

wonderful decoration I ever got. 
No decoration I got in later li
fe could ever. It was a very 
childish action. I know that now, 
but I think it started the way 
I was about to go from t hen 
on. 
 

Q: What happened with your relationships, your
 friendships, with the girlfriends that you 
had or people you were friends with? Once this happened, did people remove themselves 

from you and your fa mily? 
 

A: You know, it was very difficult. They said, "Why are you stubborn?  You want to study, 
you want to -- just give in. What
 is so difficult that you give in
 a little bit and do it?" I felt 
I couldn't. What they did, I will say that 
my father was very known person in Hamb urg. 

He has written the history of religion. That
 book is still taught in school, the same  book, 
at the universities. So he lost, of course, 
his job. He was ill anyway. That was very good. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0265  
35 
 
It was a thing where the Gest
apo could let go and say, "Let's  see what they'r e doing." So, 
he was, I would say, ignored. And that was our
 luck. But, it was very, very difficult for 
me to give in and to raise my arm. How it was resolved that I was sit in the last  bench in 
my class and they simply ignored me . They just let me  go, let me  do.  
 

Q: And when you went home, did you ha
ve friends outside of your fa mily? 
 

A: It was very difficult. We  had, of course
, a few friends. We  woul
d always have a few 
friends who thought the same  way like we. And 
this friendship got even deeper. But the 
separation between the others got altered. It wa
s very difficult. From that time, I really 
felt my hous e was my fortress. The effect was my
 father was very ill by that time  already 
with Parkinson's. That was the only sa ving gr
ace because as known as he was, originally 
they wanted to arrest him as one of the peopl
e that instigated of th
e liberal move me nt, of 
the democratic party. But they left him alone 
because to begin they tread lightly with the 
known persons. To begin with, because they wanted
 first to get really 
in. So, they let him 
very soon, I must say thank heaven, he die
d, because that was the only saving grace for 
him. My mo ther was a very known liberal pers
on. She was at this point, of course, only 
concerned about how far she could bring this 
family through to those time s. We  really 
tried as best  we could. How did we do it fina
ncially?  Because there was no money left 
and my father was not anymore in the situati
on he was. So, we started now to teach. All 
the years when we studied at the universi
ty, every day for hours and hours, we all had 
students. 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0265  
36 
 
Q: Everybody; your mother included. 
 

A: My mother, my brother, we all. You know?  
I called it my tuition. (laughter). Because it 
was the only way how we could survive. I taught
. I was at that time, I barely had passed 
school myself, so I was not much of anything 
yet. I had to start to study. But I had all 
these children who didn't  do so well in school
. I taught arithme tic. I was not very good 
myself but I learned arithme tic with them, 
you se e?  La nguages. Every day I taught them, 
you see, and that way we could take  the m
oney to study at the uni
versity, because it was 
very expensive to study at the university. On
ly those who join the party, and they, of 
course, got all the advantages. We  didn't do th
is. And so we had no choice. We  had either 
to pay and then to get the money or else. A
nd, so, for years and year
s, I just tutored, and 
we all tutored. 
 
Q: Now your mother also was he
lping Jewish people in Hambur g. 
 
A: Yes, that was the other thing. We  ha d quite
 a few Jewish friends. Very soon, of course, it 
came that these Jewish people were arrest ed. A
nd so we tried, and I will say ma inly my 
mother because I was still a very young person, bu
t we tried to help as much as we could. 
We had quite a few Jewish friends and we trie
d to help them as much as possible. For 
example, my mother, as my father, had ve
ry good connections to embassies, to people 
from abroad. And so, ma ny times she went to them to the English Embassy and asked for 

help. And little by little, they
 knew my mother. They knew of
 my father. He had a very 
good reputation all over Germany be cause he 
was a scholar, you know?  And so, we could 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0265  
37 
 
help to get these passports for Jewish people 
to ge t away. That was where my mother was 
very, very helpful. 
 
Q: Did she do it for people she 
knew or as well for an undergrou
nd group so that it was . . . ? 
 

A: For people she knew. And, you know, it always starts small. And they brought other 
people, and they brought other people. That 
gets bigger and bigger. It's  amazing whe n 

you get involved in the work, how one come s 
to the next. These things develop. So, for 
example, I studied then. I was not finished 
for my  school and what study would I have to 
do?  My three brothers studied me dicine. We  
all had government assistance before. But, 
of course, now where we had not joined the 
Party, everything was and we had to do it 
ourselves. It was very difficult. So, what my
 mother did, what we all did, we tutored 
children who did not do good at school for 
hours and hours every day. Some ti me s I had 
the feeling our house was like a 
little cage with ma ny birds in
 it, you know, as we tutored 
them. It worked. It was years of very hard 
work, but it was the only way we could afford 
the money. 
 
Q: Tutored Jewi sh children? 

 

A: No. Jewish children by that time , they we re probably dead alr
eady, you know?  No, they 
were not there any more. No. Children simply . . . 
 

Q: You're talking about after '39? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0265  
38 
 
 
A: Yeah, after '39. Yeah. But also, I me an, af
ter '33, you didn't have ma ny Jewish children. I 
mean, very few. I mean, everybody who had to
 go. Because '39, I don't  think there were 
ma ny Jews l e ft. I mean they were simply arrested. The Jewish people. I don't talk any 

more of the Jewish people. They were very s
oon that started after '33. I cannot really give 
you the dates. It was too long ago. Bu
t, they were simply arrested. 
 

Q: Do you remember seeing Jews arrested? 

 

A: But our Jewish friends, you see, we had . . 
. that was a different story because my mot her, 
and again my father, we had very good connections to the English Embassy. And so, I 

reme mber all the days when my mother was 
ready for days and days trying to go from 
one embass y to the other to try to help them out. That we were very successful in. I 
shouldn't say we. It was my mother and my fath
er, as much as  he was still . . . he was 
very ill later on, but he always was in it. S
o, that was very beautif
ul. We  helped quite a 
few of our J e wish friends out. But, you see, 
all that was so fast. Very soon. I mean, I 
think it started then. Wa s it '39?  Wh en was th
e bi g arrest in Germa
ny?  Correct me . I think 
much earlier already, wasn't  it, that the Je
wish people were arrested. And, of course, it 
was too late. 
 
Q: Do you remember Kristalnacht(ph)?  

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0265  
39 
 
A: Absolutely I reme mber that, too. See, certa
in things you never forget. I reme mber it to 
that point that I very ofte
n dream of it. This is very
 bad, you know?  You never quite 
shake the things you have seen. They will stay with you. 
 
Q: What do you reme mber about this? 

 

A: I reme mber the mob, the screaming people. People I had known as neighbors who 
suddenly were screaming and raiding Jewi
sh home s. You could do anything that you 

wanted. Anything, just kicked in the wi
ndows. There was nothing. The Jewish people 
were arrested, of course, as much as they were
 there. My mother was very instrume ntal of 
getting Jewish people passports, passbook, 
whatever. Whatever worked. She did 

wonderful things at that time. And s he wa
s away someti mes for days. Wh en she came 
home  we would ask her. She would say, "P
lease don't ask me ." Because the less we 
knew, the better for us. And the less again sh
e knew of my work later on, the better for 
her. So, we never talked much with each 
other because bear in mi nd the Gestapo had 
me thods which aren't  known here. Methods of
 torture where not anybody could have . . . 
I mean, it was simply humanly i mpossible. So, more or less, they could find out 

everything they wanted once they had you. So 
the best thing was really not knowing. And 
those dreaded years where we all got very si
lent, because silence was the best thing. I 
knew my mother was often away for days. I 
did not ask any questi
on. Then little by little 
when all the arrest s came and the war came, then when the Germans invaded Norway and 

Denmark, I had already my exams at that time.
 Then I was asked to take totally control 
over them. That was one of the highlights of
 my life. I thought, "My God, here is a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0265  
40 
 
chance. I can really do some thing." But, again, 
it also meant that I had to become  very 
silent. Because under torture nobody was holding 
up. So, it meant that more or less I had 
to remove myself from my friends, from 
my mother as much as I could, so nobody knew 
what I was doing. 
 
Q: So you had . . . clearly, you would not be ab
le to be intima te with anybody about what 
you . . . 
 

A: Under torture, you can get everything out, 
everything out. I learned 
that from experience. 
There is nothing so the ma in thing was 
silence, and doing what
 you felt yourself was 
necessary, but not involving anybody
 else because I felt really what I did myself I had to 
respond. I would have to be punished myself
. But to involve anybody else was extremely 
dangerous. And also the more other people 
knew, the more danger for you. Believe me , 
this country, you see, it's very hard fo
r you to envision. Under 
torture, nobody holds up. 
Once you are tortured, there is nothing 
which can hold up. I knew if I would be 
discovered. I didn't even know what my moth
er was doing, because I knew she did a lot 
of things. I didn't even want to know it, be
cause not knowing meant really gracious that 
you couldn't even invent anything because 
you wouldn't know. You have never had the 
system in this country. How fortunate you are. It's very hard for you to envision. But 

under the pressure of the Gestapo, nobody could hold up. 
 

Q: Were you ever questioned by the Gestapo? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0265  
41 
 
A: Yes. I was several times. I think two or 
three time s I was summoned by the Gestapo. The 
interesting thing was we had two systems in Germany. The one that was the, the legal 
system, whi c h was the old Germany, and the 
system you have  here. And I was hired by 
the legal syst em to supervise all activities of the political  Scandinavian pr isoners. But on 

the other side was the Gestapo who knew no la
w and no order. And they, of course, could 
do with you what you wanted. So here was th
e interesting thing. I 
was appointed by the 
Minister of Justice of the old 
legal order to take over the total supervision in the pr isons. 
But, on the other hand, I had the Gestapo w
ho were looking for th
at woman. Why would 
she have such a . . . waiting for that mome nt
 where they coul d t
ug(ph) me and clearly 
give me  what was due me according to them. Th
at was a very interesting relationship. It's 
very hard for you people to understand. So I 
walked a very thin path. I had all my 
credentials there from the highest Minister of Justice from Ber lin. Whenever the Gest apo 

started to answer, I showed this and said, 
"Look here, you have to answer these people." 
And that was this little double ga
me  I led that's really practica
lly saved my life. That gave 
me that authority because the interesting thi
ng was again in the prisons there were also 
very sharp laws. And I knew these people were
 pr actically my pris
oners but practically 
starving to death. So I said we have to do so
me thing. And I put in the luggage heavy with 
bread, with me dication, ma inly vitami ns. I me
a n, things which we either concentrated 
which could keep them up. They did not dare to open my luggage because I again was a 

very high authority appointed by Berlin. Y
ou see, it's funny how for people here in 
America don't understand. It's worked very
 much by authority and since I had been 
appointed by high authority, they did not dare
 examine wha t  I was taking in. Why I was 
doing these things because they were afraid of
 me. This other world(ph), such a system as 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0265  
42 
 
we had in Germany, the Nazi system, which is
 a system which other countries could have 
too, which is always a potential. It works 
on the fear. The one fears the other. And he 
who can instill the most fear will have the 
upper top. So my whole policy in dealing with 
the authorities was to have continuously refe
rred to my connections in Be rlin. And the 

connections in Berlin had certain for them lik
e Hitler, didn't quite know what they should 
make of me. There was anothe
r thing they couldn't understand. They couldn't  understand 
that I was a academic, that I had all the e
ssential examinations 
for that particul ar 
examination exactly understood. But why oh wh
y would they appoint a woma n?  And I 
was only a woma n. Tha t  was very hard to 
understand, especially 
for these high Nazi 
officials. And so, little by little, a saga de
veloped. Some how s he must have very high 
connections to Berlin. (laught
er) And since I very often sa
id Berlin doesn't  like this. 
(laughter) I had to play my game because 
not only did I ha ve to save my beloved 
prisoners but also my own life, 
the life of my siblings at st
ake. If I had really been found 
out, it would have been tragic, you know? 
 

Q: Were you frightened throughout this? 

 

A: Very much s o. Don't think that I . . . The 
greatest insult I still had 
when my Scandinavian 
people tried to stop and tell me I was a hero. 
I said, "Please don't say that I'm a hero. I 
was ever afraid of the next . . . there's not
hing, no hero in me." But I felt I had to go my 
way. That is what I had decided even to the 
point of this: I would 
have been killed or 
hanged. I think I had to go my way. When 
you'r e very young, I think you can make that 
kind of decision. And I must tell
 you, if such a situation woul
d arise again today, I think I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0265  
43 
 
would be able to act the same  way. Thank h
eaven it has never . . . that was one of the 
reasons I came  to this country. I needed, af
ter all this was over and I had survived, I 
needed to forget. You see, when everythi
ng was over, Scandinavia was so good to me . 
You have no idea. They treated me , I mean 
I can almost start to cry. There never was 
anybody treated better. They came to me . The ve
ry first moment they came, they sent 
food. They then finally invited me  to Sca
ndinavia. I could study. I could finish my 
medicine. There was not a thing they didn't 
do fo r me. And I will never forget that. The 
gratitude was overwhelming. But still when a
ll is said and done and I had passed my  
examinations, the one thing that had never le
ft me Œ my me mories. This what was so 
totally destroyed. Because I loved Ge rmany. I loved my country just as you love your 

country. And I haven't seen it for years and year
s. This total destruc
tion of all I had loved, 
of the spirit of good, of a ll th
ese things which was for me
 Germany. Some how I had to 
try to forget. I felt Scandinavia was too clos
e to it all. So after the war I had my 
examinations there, I studied me dicine there. They were extremely good to me . And t hey 

said, "Now you will st ay with us." Instead, I th
ink, I have to leave. I have  to go where I 
can forget what happened. First, they couldn'
t quite understand that. But they said, "You 

have to ." But they forgave me  and they finally sa id, "If that's what you must do, we will 

bless you and we will wish you our good wishes."  And I can assure you even today after 

so ma ny yea r s, if some body come s from Scandina
via, they will always come to me. They 
will not only come to Wa shington, they come
 to me . And that ma ybe has been even a 
greater reward for me than all the wonderful 
kinds of decorations th
ey after bestowed on 
me. This gratitude, this reme mbrance, this love. That will forever be in my heart. I'm very 

grateful for that.

Q: Tell me about -- you and your mother were 
baking loaves for bread and you were taking 
them into the prisons? 
 

A: Yes. That was what I did because it's hard for you to imagine because even in this pr ison 
system here in America, it certainly is not 
very comfortable because I have been visi ting 

prisons here. But certainly they get fed and, I 
mean, it's absolutely ac
cording to schedule 
and all this. But there, it was really was so
 very little. starved 
out. I mean, they got 
rations. It's hard for you to imagine. Of course, don't forget you only hear about the 

people who survived. You know, of course, 
of the2,000,000 of people who died. And not 
only Jewish people, but ma ny, ma
ny of our political prisone
rs from wherever. Simply 
overstaffed finally, but there was a certain or
der in prison still. It was a mi nimu m. A 
mi ni mu m of rationing, but it was so that they ju
st could get by if they were strong. So the 
young ones survived. The older ones it was more difficult. And so what I felt I had to do 

when I was appointed from Berlin to this sp
ecial situation, to supe
rvise the visits my 
Scandinavian political prisoners got, I felt not
 only do I have to supervise there my wa y, 
that's not enough. But I have also to give them
 help as much as I could. And so I had a 
wonderful idea. Everybody in Germany was afra
id of the air raids and that they would 
lose everythi ng. So, I had two very heavy pieces of luggage. And each time  when I went 

into the prison or into these camps, I filled 
my luggage with bread, with vitami ns, with 

anything possible to give them nourishment. And 
I locked them in and that they never ask 
you to open it. They couldn't because there 
again was the idea a very high position. I was 
appointed directly by Berlin. So whenever they even ma de a little ask what have you 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0265  
45 
 
there, I showed them my thing and they sa
id, "Well, but all the luggage. Why don't  you 
leave it here? We can keep it he
re." I said, "Oh no, that goes 
right with me because if we 
are bombed, I will have my luggage. That is th
e last thing I ha ve." And they never dared. 
And that is never anybody dared to say, "
open the luggage." Because one opening they 
would have known what was in it, all these 
things for the prisoners. Why did they not 
dare it?  Because I really had a very high pos
ition. I was above them. I came more or less 
as if you think your controller come s to cont
rol what you're doing. So, that was really the 
tremendous blessing I had. So isn't this awful 
how the one fooled the other?  That was the 
whole game the Gestapo played. To some exte
nt, they were afraid of me . I was, of 
course, very much afraid of
 them. (laughter) But if you knew how to play it, some how 
you could really give them help. Wh at kind of 
help could I give?  You see, these prisoners 
were . . . It's very hard for you even to envi
sion that. They were at an absolute zero. But 
they mostly needed . . . they needed, of 
course, nourishment. They needed me dication. 
Now, it was nice to carry in brea
d. I tried to carry that in. But 
that was so little. What they 
ma inly needed were vitami ns, I me a n, just to 
give them the most basic. Some how to keep 
them alive. And, see, that's what I had in 
my luggage. I had two rather heavy pieces of 
luggage which I had to carry myself because 
the Norwegian and Danish priests, I could 
very well understand it, that they coul d not do 
this because that was really my risk. And 
so I had to carry them myself. 
And also by carrying them in my
self, since I had this rather 
high position directly appoint
ed by Berlin, anybody who woul
d ever had dared to say, 
"open your luggage", and there was a good po
ssibility, I would have said, "Look here, 
you don't know who your talking with." And w
ould have uttered a few name s off. The 
whole system of Nazism, which I think you 
have found out and understood, is that the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0265  
46 
 
one feared the other. And if you worked on th
e fear, based on the fear the other had for 
you, then you some how could get away. At 
least you took a very 
good chance to do it. 
That was really my whol e work, and some how I could do it. You see, what took place 
already, very much the prison systems all used 
different . . . different prisons. You see, I 

went from prison to the other. How in th
e world could a woma n get such a high job?  
Because I wa s only a woma n. In Naz i  Germany, 
the woman was really 
just there to give 
children. That already some ho
w ma de them a little bit suspicious. There must be 
some thing special with her if she would get 
this permission from Berlin. So, that was 
already a very good thing. And so they tried to 
stay as much as possible out of it. And at 
least if they would have said, "open your l
uggage", which they usually would have done, 
I would imme diately said, "Do you realize who 
I am? "  That would have been the end of 
that. So, the whole system of 
Nazi, which I think is hard; it
's  very difficult to understand 
here is that the one intimidates the other. It
 was a system of i ntimidation. That is what I 
had to pay. It worked very much with 
me . Because the good thing was I was a woma n 
and they always felt if a woma n really would 
get . . . that's such a hard thing, then she 
must be something special. You see, it is a sy
stem that the one is fearful of the other. 
Because I was just afraid of
 them, of course. (laughter) 
 
Q: Dr. Zassenhaus, when you first had the job cen
soring letters, they ga
ve you letters from 
ghettos from Poland, isn't that right? 
 

A: Yes, yes, yes. 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0265  
47 
 
Q: Were those the first letters that you we re . . .? 
 

A: Those were some  of the very first letters.
 You see, I was in the censored system because 
due to by my language ability. You see, I 
had also studied English. It was very by 
circumstance. It's all about education. Sca
ndinavian language, English language, French. 
So, they coul d use me for all these 
things. That wa s how
 it all started.  
 

Q: But was this a shock to you?  Had you known about the 
ghettos in Poland? 
 

A: Yes. I knew that because, see, we had for y
ears and years every night
 we listened to the 
English . We knew about it. Oh, yes, we were totally aware of whatever the English 

people knew. The BBC we knew. Because night 
by night we heard that. Yes, we were 
fully aware of it. 
 

Q: These letters were not on regular pieces of 
paper, I gather. These were on tissues of . . . 
 

A: They'r e tissue! Toilet tiss
ue! All kinds of things. Whatev
er they could get on. And they 
sent food, you know?  Se nd food. I mean, of course
, I was there in order to throw it out. 
So what I did -- Yes, of course, I put the tissue out. But, see, they had also for m letters. 

They had the for m letters. And the form 
letters, they went through. That was "Dear 
mother and father, I am doing well. They give
 me  a wonderful time, plenty enough to eat. 
Don't you worry." And then there I put in "send food". 
 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0265  
48 
 
Q: So you wrote it in? 
 

A: I wrote this. I tried to get my handwriting . 
. . yes, I wrote that i
n. That was the only way. 
"Send food". See, that wa s the risk I took.It was a risk which I simply ignored. My 

parents, my mother, who was very unhappy 
about it, said "Why do you do that, because 
you give them little evidence." 
If that letter was found, of c
ourse, yes. But there again I 
based it on the stupidity on the(laughter) again 
on the prison authorities. Because, see, I 
was the fi nal and the highest authority. I was the fi nal author ity to send out these letters. 

And so they, of course, were very afraid 
of me . That's Nazi system. To understand the 
Nazi system, you have to realize that the one is 
afraid of the other. It
's  just a thing how far 
can you play it. And the me re fact that I wa
s a wo man made the Gestapo think she must 
be of the highest order, otherwise sh
e would never have gotten this job. 
 
Q: Now one day there were no more letters from the ghetto. 
 

A: Yeah,yeah. 

 

Q: And you asked some body. 

 

A: And I thought where are my letters. I aske
d, you know. And there was 
this deep silence. 
They had been sent away, you know?  Then, of 
course, it was up to me  to find out where 
that is. It's probably just the same  in Amer
ica, I would think. Th
e prison authorities had 
different prisoners. One didn't know about the ot
her. So now I had to try to trace them. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0265  
49 
 
And, you see, by that time, I had built up a sy
stem already. My prisoners knew that I 
expected them to let me  know. They found 
some  ways. It was wonderful. You have no 
idea what huma ns can find about when they
 are in a tough situa
tion. They always found 
some how a way to let me  know where they had come . 
 

Q: You're not talking now talking about Jews
 in Poland. You're now talking about -- you 
didn't know . . . 
 

A: I talk now about my Sca ndinavian prisone
rs. See, the Jewish people . . . you must 
understand they had nothing to do with the prison system. They were me rely . . . 
 

Q: Those were your letters that
 you got. They just stopped . . . 
 
A: But my letters fr om the Jews, that st o
pped. That I could do nothing anymore for them. 
No. That was over. You see, now I had onl
y the Scandinavians where I could follow 
through to the other system. It 's very ha
rd, I think, to understand for anybody here. We 
had two systems. The one was the prison system 
that was still the old order. Very strict 
and very awful and very mean. But t he Gestapo system was simply -- I mean, I hated it. 
Once the order was given that the Jewish 
people -- and I hate it. I could nothing do. 
However, I saved one Jewish people. I thought
 whatever, that means one. That one me ans 
better than nobody. Because we had, in my prison, in one of my prisons some where in 

Germany, we had one Jewish person who by error, by simply error, had landed in a 

prison instead of the concentration camp. See, now, that was my favorite child. I alwa ys 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0265  
50 
 
called him my favorite son because I had to 
have  a special eye on him that they di dn't 
find out that he was Jewish. And all throughthe years, you know, I had a special eye on 
him.  
 

Q: So he was one of your Scandinavian boys? 

 

A: He was one of my, yeah . . . (laughter) 

 

Q: There were no girls in 
this Scandinavian prison. 
 

A: There were ma ny men. Most of them I had me n. 

 

Q: Most, but you did have some  wome n. 
 
A: I had also some  wome n, yes. But, mo st
 were me n. You know, it's a usual thing. When 
Hitler came to or raided a count
ry, he  first took the elite of 
the country. I really had the 
elite of the country. He simply in one life they
 were all put to the 
next prison or jail or 
wherever. So, they came to the German prisons
. It was really the elite of the country. 

From the universities, from the governme nt. 
Fine, most wonderful people. The mi nute 
they came, there again came  the system bureaucracy. They needed some body who spoke 

there who was perfect in the language who ha
d all these academic examinations. Because 
there were ma ny peopl e who talked Norwegian or Danish. But it ha s to be  academic 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0265  
51 
 
degree. And, thank heaven, before I had my
 medicine degree, I 
studied Scandinavian 
languages. I had my full academic career in 
it. That was which got me  this position. 
 
Q: You worked with Mr. Jenkins. But there was also a daughter, Anna Jenkins, who you me t 
later on and then realized there was a much
 wider connection in helping you than you 
knew. Can you talk about that a little? 
 

A: Well, Mr. Jenkins was really the hero of
 my life, I can only 
say, you know?  I never saw 
him afterwa r ds again, because he died too. He
 was killed finally. But, he sent me  his 
daughter. This daughter helped me  very mu
ch in organizing and finding. You see, the 
problem wa s these people are really dying. Th
is was a question of life and death. It was 
not only a question of encouraging them. They 
needed some me dicine. I needed vitami ns. 
I needed all these things. Wh
ere could I get it in Ha mburg, which was bombed out?  So I 
built it up little by little -- c
onnections like Anna. Like thes
e pe ople who could get them 
from other countries who came. Who could 
get them by their connections. So I had a 
whole network of people who helped me  in th
is, that I could do this. And, you see, the 
important thing was that we knew very little
 of each other. Because whenever anybody 
was caught, were tortured by the Gestapo. I 
have seen how people got tortured. Nobody 
would hold up. 
 

Q: Where did you see that? 

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0265  
52 
 
A: Oh, I saw that in the Gestapo quarters, for 
instance. I saw these things. I mean, these were 
also known things, but I saw them. I saw the 
people afterwards -- how they looked. They 
have told me  about it. And I saw what th
ey did. I mean, it was inhuman. That was the 
terrible fear, of course, of the people who 
were close to me . My God, would you ever be 
able to hold up afterwards when and if you
'r e caught?  And, see, ther
e was a thing that I 
admitted. That was a danger point . Under torture, nobody is holding up. Don't ever think . 

. . there is no hero who can hold up under to
rture. And, so, there I had always a poison 
with me . Al ways I had a me dication with me
 whi c h I would have taken and would have 
ma de it end. But, of course, my mother alwa
ys said "Please, don't do it too fast." You 
have to find the proper moment to do it." I 
was very fortunate. I never came to that 
mome nt where I felt I had to do it. 
 

Q: Where did get the poison from?  
 
A: I can't  remember. I think from this captai
n. You see, poison was easier to get because, as 
you ma y know, ma ny of Jewish people, lots 
of our Jewish friends, simply poisoned 
themselves. It came in a little capsule. Stric 
(ph), stric (ph) -- how
 do you call it?  I don't  
know what you call it. So me thing which woul
d kill you instantly. Ma ny of these Jewish 
people did do it this way. And, so, I had that
. It was good for me . It 
gave me a sense of 
liberty. That if it come s to the worse, I can
 do this. And my pa re
nts knew about this. I 
was totally open to them. They totally agreed. Becasue to submit to torture -- that's also 

one of the wrong ideas in America. They sa
y, "Oh, some  people got tortured and they 
hold up." No. Under torture, nobody holds up. If you 
ever come  to that, it's lost. And so I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0265  
53 
 
felt I knew too much. I had no other way out. I 
would have to do it. So whenever, and it 
was not often, I think twice, I came under th
ese intensive feelings
 from the Gestapo. 
There was intensive -- that hours and hours and 
hours. It's  simply a thing to wear you 
down. You won't believe it. I had a great se ns
e of freedom. Because 
I had it right in my 
pocket. It was just one move me nt. Before that, 
jump at me and I would have been dead. It 
was stric (ph). I don't know how you callit. But some thing which you can end it 
imme diately. And, no, it did not ma ke me  unha
ppy. It gave me  a sense of I was in 
control. This is very hard for you to unde
rstand nowadays. And now I'm an old woman. 
You mi ght ask me  would I do it again. Yes 
and yes and again, yes. I would do it again. 
I'm very grateful that I could get away from
 it from all these me mories. Have I forgotten 
it?  No. There are certain mo me nts in your lif
e you will never forget. Maybe that is the 
punishme nt God gives me. I don't know how you'r e going to . . . But you never . . . it 

lives with you forever and forever. For exampl
e, very hard for me  to come today to you. I 
hope you appreciate it. 
 
Q: We appreciate it very much. 

 

A: But, the only way I could go on living and 
could get reasonably happy again is that I 
could say, God, I tried everything that was in 
my power to do what I had to do. And also 
in later life to pass on the trut h. Because the tr
uth is the only beauty we finally have in 
this life. I thank you for giving me  that. 
 

Q: Thank you so much. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0265  
54 
 
 
A: Forgive me, please. It was very hard for me. 

 

Q: But it really is an honor. 

 

A: If you had not been such a beautiful woma
n, believe me, I think I would not have come 
through it. But I feel it has to be done becau
se, my God, how c hildren know that. It is
