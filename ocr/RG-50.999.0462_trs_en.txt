introduction.
 
 
Dora was bornT eodora Basch, January
 
31, 1938
, i n  
Zagreb, Yugoslavia.  Here we 
see Dora sitting ona park bench with her younger brother Zdravko. On thismap of Yugoslavia 
in 1933,the arrow points to Zagreb.
 
 
In thisphoto, we see Dora on an outing to the zoo with her parents,Salamon and 
Silva.  Salamon ran abrush

makingf actory and Silva was a teacher.
 
 
Picturedhere is Dora's maternal grandf ather,Rabbi Josef  Leopold Deutsch.  In 
A p ri l
 
1941, when Dorawas visiting her m aternal grandparents in thesm all town of Ludbreg, 
Germ any invaded Yugoslavia.  Ludbreg becam epartof  a puppet state run by the Ustasa,or 

the creation f ascists
. 
 
In June
 
1941, Dora'sparentsand herbrotherwere arrested. Their house keeper 
got baby Zdravko out of prison,andf rom  then on Dora and Zdravkowere shelteredby their 
m other's sister,Giza, and her husband,Ljudevit.  On the lef t we seeAuntGiza.  O
n the right 
we see her husband, Ljudevit.  Thephotoof Ljudevit was takenm any years after theone of 

G i za .
  
Later in the war Aunt Giza was denounced and 
sent
 
toAuschwit z where she perished.  
Dora remained in Yugoslavia until 1957 when she em igrated to t
he United States.
 
 
W eclose with this portrait of  Aunt Giza, Dora, and Zdravko that was taken tobe 
sent to Ljudevit in the concentration cam p where he had been sent. 
 
 
In 1957, as Dora was on her way to Swit zerl and, she met Daniel Klaym an who was 
returnin

By thef ollowing year, Dan and Dora cam e toW ashington, D.C. and Dan em barked 
on a careeras a researcher in medical chem istry at the
 
W alter Reed Arm y institute of  
R

Af ter thebirth of their two children,W anda and Elliott, Dora resum ed her education, 
getting degrees in French andEnglish asa second language.  Shethen

Af ter Dora retired f rom  full

tim e teaching in 1999, she became active as a volunteer 
here at thismuseum .Her work here consists prim arily of translating m a
terial f rom  the 
Holocaust written in Croatian, Bosnian, andSerbian. Her ongoing project is connected tothe 
Jasenovac Archive.  As we will hear later, Jasenovac was a major concentration cam p.  Other

Hebrew.
 
 
W ith that, I'd like to ask you to join me in welcom ing our

Mrs .
 
Dora 
Klaym an.
 
 
[Applause]
 
 
Dora, thank you so much for joining us andfor your will ingness to be our
 
F i rs t  
Person
.  You have som uch to tell usthat we're going
 
to  sta rt righ t awa y.
 
 
You were just 3 years old whenW orldW ar IIcam e directly to Yugoslavia in the 
spring of 1941 when it was attacked by Germany.  Before we turn to thehorrors ofWorldW ar 

II and the Holocaust, tell us a little bitabout yourf am ily and your community in the years 
bef ore war began.
 
>> Dora Klaym an:  My m aternalfam ily lived in the sm all town of  Ludbreg andm y f ather's 

fam ily actually came to Zagrebf airly recently bef ore all of thishappenedand had come en 
route f rom  Romania to Bos
n
ia
, to Zagreb.  I did not know thatfam ily ver y well at all
 e
xcept for 
m y parents' siblings
 
--
 
m y f at h e r' s  s ib lin
gs .   
By the tim e I was born, only m y grandm otherwas 
alive.  I have alm ostno m em ory of  her.
 
 
My f atherhadf ive siblings, two m ale siblingssurvi ved the war andonefemale. So 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

oneaunt and two uncles.  I cantalk about them  later.
  
Onm y m other's side of the fam ily, 
whom  I knew m uchbetter, they were in the sm all town of Ludbreg andm y grandfather arrived 
theref rom Slovakia.  He was recruited by
 
thecomm unity, a small Jewish com m unity, to com e 
andbea rabbi there. By the time war started hehad served asa rabbif or 40 years in that 

sm all town.
  
 
 
Som y m other was born there. She was the youngestof four children.  Andthetwo 
older children hadbeen born in Slovakia butcam ef airly young.  T he one sisterof m y m other's 
worked in a bankandhadfinished a school that would allow her todo that.  My m other 
f inished a teacher's college.  Theolder children didnot have these kinds of professions.
 
By the time war started, basically thefam ily had,m ore or less
 
--
 
the oldest son had lef t for 
Zagreb, but m y mother's sisters were li ving in that sm all town of  Ludbreg.
 
 
My m other hadm arried by then, of course, and was livin g in Zagreb at that point.  
S
o this ishow I was born in Zagreb. And thatwas generally the situation.
 
 
My grandfather was not only the rabbibutalso served as teacher inthepublic 
school. The Jewish children would then have their religious education given through them in 
public schools. It was af airly ecum enical townf or that period. T hatwas a Russian 
O
r t ho do x 
priest who also taughtchildren who were of  that religion, though the town was alm ostall 

Rom an Catholic.  So that was, of course.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You describe
d 
to m e t
hat Ludbreg
 
was an integrated com munity.
 
>> Dora Klaym an: It was totally an integrated comm unity.  Basically Croatia did not have 
anything of  the kind that Poland, let's say, had. T here were no such things as s
h te tls
.  It wa s 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

an integrated community.  Jews had not lived in Yugoslavia f or nearly as long as som eother 
western parts of Europe or eastern partsof Europe, actually, like Polandor Russia. They were 
basically integrated and on the whole educated, ran businesses, were reasonably well
-
to
-
d o.
 
>> B
ill Benson: W e don't have tim efor you to tell usa whole lotm ore about that period,but 
your f atherhad a sm all brush
-
makingf actory.  Buthis real love was being a cantor which is 
how he met yourm other, I believe.  Right?
 
>> Dora Klaym an: I think so,
 
yes.  He wouldcom e tothe town of Ludbreg as a 
cantor
 
f or the 
holidays. T hat's how he metm y m other. It seem s to have beena totally cantorialf am ily.  

Even m y cousins whonow li ve in Israel,oneof  them is really a professional 
cantor
 
and the 
other on
e is very m uch into that.  So it seem sto be running in thefam ily, yes.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And hopefully that will continue.
 
>> Dora Klaym an:  Yes.
 
>> Bill Benson:  At som e point.
 
 
W hen Germ any launched its attack on Yugoslavia on April
 
6, 1941, you were aw
a y 
on a visit with relatives in Zagreb. 
 
>> Dora Klaym an: InLudbreg.
 
>> Bill Benson:  I'm  sorr y.  T ell us what you can about the circum stances that cause
d 
you to be 
away f rom  your parents when the Germ ans cam e in.
 
>> Dora Klaym an: W ell, this is sort of apuzzl e which I will never res olve.  I don't really know 
whether m y parents sentm e tom y grandparents because they knew that something was going 
to happenor thatm y brother hadalready been born and he was a baby andthere were 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
8
 
neighbors who had com e into town and it was anopportunity to send me by train to m y 
grandparents. 
 
 
I was def initely in Ludbreg by the time war started. And even though I was very 
young, only 3 years old, I sort of havem em ories and im agesof  everybody being ver y upset 
because 
Yugoslavia fell in six days af terbeing attacked by Germany in the spring.
 
>> Bill Benson: W henthat happened in April of  1941, the war hadbeen going onf orabout 18 

m onths elsewhere
 w
ith theattack of
 
--
 
when Germ any invaded Poland inSeptem ber
 
1939.
 
>>
 
Dora Klaym an: Only f rom talking topeople and having studiedabout it.  I don't have 
m em oriesf rom  it.  From  what I know, there were many ref ugeesthat came into Yugoslavia 
andthrough Yugoslavia.  
 
 
Inf act, we have a survivor here who actually works at
 
the m useum  and has done
 
F i rs t  P e rs on
, Joanna. Her fam ily camefrom Germ any.  They went through Yugoslavia to 
Albania.  Andapparently there were m any people that had takenthat route.  Of course, once 

war started in Germ any, these people were caught alm ost imm ediately and sent to 
concentration cam ps.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Do you know if your parentshadm ade
 
--
 
with war happening elsewhere and 
ver y m uch on the horizon andthen it happened, had your parentsmadeany efforts totry to get 
outof  Yugoslavia, to your knowledge?
 
>> Dora Klaym an:  No.  No.  I know that they didn't. It isn't that I don't know.
 
>> Bill Benson: T hat they did not.
 
>> Dora Klaym an:  Nobody m adeany effort. Inf act, either they didn't have an opportunity or 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
9
 
they didn't believe that this
 
was going to happen. A very good f riend of m ine whohas worked 
actually at them useum ,as a volunteerfor awhile
 
--
 
she's now elderl y
 
--
 
she says thather 
fam ily, they were m uch better to dothan we were and hadthe means of  leaving.  T hey didn't 
leave 
until the very last day.  They actually lef t the very last day.
 
>> Bill Benson: T he very last day.
 
>> Dora Klaym an: SoI don't know of peoplewho tried to leave before. W hether they didn't 
know where to or didn't have them eans or just didn't believe wh
at was going to happen.  I 
don't know.
 
>> Bill Benson:  YourAunt Giza and Uncle Ljudevit and otherm em bers learned your parents 

hadbeen arrestedand then sent to a concentration cam p but that your brother had been 
savedf rom being deported to the cam p. T ellus som eabout your parents and what you know 
about what happened to them and what happened with your brotherthathedidnotend up 
there with them.
 
>> Dora Klaym an: Actually, I should probably backupa littlebecause in talking aboutm y 

f a m ily in  L
udbreg, Ifailed to mention that m yAuntGiza was m arried to a Catholicfellow and 
that that m arriage
 
--
 
we saw earlier. T hat marriage did notoccuruntil practically before the 
war because whetherfor reasons of diff erentreligions or other reasons, they
 
had been f riends 
for a very long tim e. At this pointLjudevit wa s born in 1885, and Giza was 10 years younger 

than he.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And Giza was considerably older
 
--
 
>> Dora Klaym an: Than m y mother, 15 years older than m y mother.  So they did not m
a rry f o r 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
10
 
a long time. There was no civil m arriage in Yugoslavia, either. Andneither was converting.  I 
think hism other was still ali ve andherfatherbeing a rabbi,neither converted and so this was 
what was going on.  But they m arried.
 
 
T here was a greatacceptance, it seem sto me, on the part of m y grandparents.  
And I can judge that by the factthat inall thephotographs
 
--
 
and I have a lotof  photographs.  
Many of them are on our site at the Holocaust 
M
useum . In thephotographs you can seehim  
a lm
ost all the tim e with the family.
 
>> Bill Benson: W ith thefamily.
 
>> Dora Klaym an: W ith the fam ily.  So,for exam ple, there was the younger sister, 
B
lanka's 
wedding, where m y m other is still a teenager, sitting in the picture.  Ljudevit is in the pictur
e .  
So even though they weren'tm arried
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  And he was a different religion.  He was acceptedas partof thefam ily.
 
>> Dora Klaym an:  Hewas accepted.  Right. T hey were not living to gether.  T hat wasn't being 
done in those days.
 
>> B ill B
enson:  Period.
 
 
[Laughter]
 
>> Dora Klaym an: Infact, when I asked him wh y they never m arried earlier,and 
I 
did as
k th a t 
question
, he said, 
ﬁW
ell, she was quite happyliving with her parentsandI was f ine living wit h 
m y m other. It was ok.
ﬂ
  
Th a t 's  it.  
 
Henever, never said that the reason they didn'tm arry was of  
thediff erent religion.  He never said that.
 
 
So  
g
oing backto yourquestion about saving m y brother,by thattime they were 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
11
 
m arried. He was really a highly respected mem berof  that com munity.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Uncle Ljudevit.
 
>> Dora Klaym an:  Yeah.  Ludva was his nickname.  He was 
d
irector of  thebank.  He had the 
m eans to go anddo som ething about it, had the transportation.  Sowhen they heard about m y 
brother, they were actually in Zagreb in sort of a holding space, a gathering camp, until people 
would be takento camp.
  
He was 9m onths old at the time. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  How did they learnthat your parents had been sentto a concentration camp?  

Do you know? 
 
>> Dora Klaym an: W ell, it was just sort of  com mon knowledge where everybody was goin g.  It 
wasn't
 
--
 
it wasn't going ver y f ar away.  Jasenovac is just af ew hours awa y f rom  Zagreb.It's in 
Croatia.  It wasn't something that was not known by ever yone.
 
>> Bill Benson:  It wasn't a secretor under the cover of  darknessor anything like that.
 
>> Dora Klaym an:  No.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You told m e that eventhough you were ver y young, 
you 
do have a vivid 
m em ory of  your aunt and uncle bringing your brotherhom e.
 
>> Dora Klaym an:  Yes.  Som ehow that memory stayed with m e.  I rem ember him  arriving with 
them  to m y grandparents' house
.  
Ithink I was just so shocked by the looksof  this baby wh o 
was cr ying and cryin g and crying.  So I sort of have am emory of  that. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  So you and your brother arenow with your auntand uncle.  Yourparents, 

they've been sentto the concentration camp. Andthen in1942, your uncle with whom  you 
were li ving was arrested and sent to the Jasenovac camp.
 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

>> Dora Klaym an: Actually, we were at the tim e
 
--
 
t o 
begin with, we were with m y 
grandparents.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Ok.
 
>> Dora Klaym an: W e were with m y grandparents until they were s entaway.  And they were 
sent away
 
--
 
there was a general, sortof  a raid, inLudbreg at thetime.  And it was 1942.  You 
a re  ri g
ht. T hat was before Ljudevit was sent. All the Jews were sent. 
 
 
My brother and I were lef t behind. At thatpoint we were lef t.  People often askm e, 
and I ask m yself
:  W
hy notm e? W hynot m ybrother?  But Ialways t hink that it was because 
we were not
 
m em bers of  that comm unity off icially.  Ever ybody was m aking constant lists.  You 
know, Schindler's lists.  There were lists of people. Sothey were orderedtom ake a list of all 

them em bers of the com munity, I'm sure. 
 
 
And prior to people being sent aw
ay they had tof ill out a lotof  papers.  And thef irst 
thing that happened, they were conf iscating worldly goods.  So I have papers
 -- 
there are 
copies of  it.  The m
useum has copiesof  it.  It says, you know, you had to put your nam e, what 
you owned.  And
 
there was such things likem y cousins,for example, have things like onegold 
necklace, two dresses, threepairs of shoes.Just everything.  Ever ything had to beaccounted 

for and given away.
 
 
So back to the business of  lists. They knew who ever ybody was, especially in a 
sm all town. That wasver y easy to do. So whenthey cam e,they would go,bum,bum , bum , 
ever ybody on the list. And I wasn't on the list.  And Ithinkthat that's the reason why we were 
left behind.
 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
13
 
>> Bill Benson:  And you were not on the listbecause you were notf rom  that com munity.
 
>> Dora Klaym an: That's m y only thought about why not.  Sothiswas thef irst businessof  
ever ybody going a way.   I heardm any people
 
--
 
it's interesting because we have anexhibit 
here inthe m
useum  at th
em om ent that says "S
o me
 
W er e  N
eighbors."   Everybody was there 
watching it happen. And Ihave heardf rom m any people af terwards telling mehow horribl
e  it  
was and they saw people going away, but, of course,nobody didanything
.  A t
 
th at m om e nt, 
a n ywa y.
 
>>
 
Bill Benson:  Is it likely, though, that in that sm all town there were others that knew you and 
your brother were there and knew that you were Jews? 
 
>> Dora Klaym an: Everybody knew who we were.  Ever ybody knew who we were.  So the 
people who conducted the raid were not local townspeople.  So they didn't know who we were.  
In the ideaof  som e were neighbors, yes, some were good neighbors.  And inmy case some 
were very good neighbors.
 
>> Bill Benson: T heydidn'tdenounce you.
 
>> Dora Klaym an:  Nobody denounced us. And nobody denouncedanybody
 
--
 
the only one 
that was denounced eventually was Giza.
 
>> Bill Benson: W e'll com e tothat.
 
>> Dora Klaym an:  Yes.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So here's your uncle, anupstandingm em berof  thecomm unity, nota Jew.  He 
ge t s  a
rrested and is sent to Jasenovac.
 
>> Dora Klaym an:  Right. Since we last talked about it, Ihad done som e reading andf ound

out to 
w
hat extent non
-
Jews who were considered political prisoners, in a sense politically not 
favorable to the regim e, were arrested. Many tim es they were actually gi ven sentences.  So 
while Je ws were just Jews 
--
 
and in the caseof  Yugoslavia it was Serbs and Rom a who were 
just arrested enm asse
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  And sim ply deportedto camps.
 
>> Dora Klaym an:  Deported to cam ps.
  
Some of the others, some ofthe Croatian Catholics 
who f ound them selves in camps, were actually som etimes given sentences.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So like triedand then
 
--
 
>> Dora Klaym an:  Yeah.  And why?  Because either they were considered comm unists or 
s ym
pathizers of  the 
Partisans
 
who were the warriors who basically was a gathering of  local 
people.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Like Tito.
 
>> Dora Klaym an: W as the leader of  it.  But very soon af ter the war began people who 

opposedthe regim e went into them ountainsand
 
created an Arm y essentially eventually
, 
w
hich was ver y prom inent, actually, in m y area.
 
 
And thepeoplef rom the town of Ludbreg, many of them had members who had left 
and joined the Guerrillas who were called 
Partisans
.  So the town generally was not 
s ym
pathetic tothe regim eand that,of  course, saved me because peopledidn't give m eup.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And now, here, of course you're with your uncle

>> Bill Benson:  Do you know anything about what that was like foryou?
 
>> Dora Klaym an: That was a period that was sort of dangerous.  I rem em ber having the 
sensethat things were  not good. Of  course,we m issedm y uncle. But also I knew that 
som etimes Ihad tobehidden som eplaceorwe had to leave townfor a bit.  I rem ember very 
clearly being told oneday we' ve got to get on the train.  And thenwe went to theneighboring 
town and stayed therefor afew days and then returned.  Because som ebody had toldus that 
th e
re would be a raid.  
 
 I
n that town, becauseof  the 
Partisans
 
sounding the town, they were ver y of ten
 
--
 
there were very of ten battlesat nightand during theday.  There wer e times that we were 
a c t u a lly lib e
rated.
 
>> Bill Benson:  In that town.
 
>> Dora Klaym an:  In that town.  But that lasted very short periodsof time.
 
>> Bill Benson:  If I rem em ber correctly, through the course of thewar there, the town changed 

hands like seven tim es. 
 
>> Dora Klaym an: Several tim es. T wice I thinkf orfairly long periods of  tim e.
 
>> Bill Benson: T he 
Partisans
 
controlling itf or a while, then the Germ ans taking itback.
 
>> Dora Klaym an:  Yes.  So the mostdiff icult, most dangeroustimes were when
 
--
 
there was a 
tim e, but 
not until laterthatthey had
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  Hopefully we'll have a chance totalk about that. 
 
 
Your parents and Uncle Ljudevit andof  course virtually all of  the Jews had been 
sent to Jasenovac.  You told me that Jasenovac was an especially vi olent place.  Can you say 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
16
 
just a little bitabout that? 
 
>> Dora Klaym an:  Jasenovac, there were anum ber of cam psand Jasenovac was built 
supposedly to be a work cam p.  Actually it wa s pretty m uch an exterm ination camp. Butnot in 
an organized sense like Auschwit z.  Peoplewere worked to death. Of ten people were just 
shot,m urdered, tortured in the cruelestof  ways
; s
ometim es in really prim itive wa ys, like, yo u 
know, being hit on the head.  
 
 
W ell, I'm  told thatespecially older people or children,older peopl
e  
--
 
someone told 
m ethat they know that m y grandf ather, who at that tim e was quite elderly and hadbeen 

paralyzed on one side
 
--
 
by the tim e they reached thef ences of the cam p, the barbed wire 
fences, thathe was just hit on thehead with a shovel and killed rightthere. Never even got 

into the camp.
 
 
So that was
 
--
 
I had read recently quite a bitabout the camp. Andnow, of  course, 
it's a memorial site.  It's been docum ented toa great degree.  It was just a really brutal, brutal 
c a m p.
 
>> Bill Benson: 
 
Early 1943 your Aunt Giza is denouncedand she is taken away. W hat 
happened to your knowledge and then whathappened
 
to
 
you and your brother? 
 
>> Dora Klaym an: At that timem y uncle tried to go after her because he had just com eback.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So heserved his sentence and they released him ?
 
>> Dora Klaym an:  Hewas released after a year. T he reasonhow he survived that very brutal 

ca m p 
--
 
he was in Jasenovac.  He survi vedfor two reasons.  He had always talked aboutt
h a t.  
Because he had run a 
bank
 
and they neededsom ebody to run theirbusiness, they hadput 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

him  inanoff ice.  So because
 
--
 
he was quitefrail.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Born in 1885.
 
>> Dora Klaym an:  Yeah.  He was older andhe was ver y f rail, always.  
H
e would have never 
m ade it. My f atherm ade it to the very end, actually.  My f ather made it to the very end and 
escaped,tried to escape at the very end. T here arepeople who say that he was with a gr oup 
of  people who escaped and then they were found out by a Germ anpatrol and shot.  But 
m y 
Uncle Ludva
 
survi ved only because he was not sent likem y father
 
--
 
whom  he saw, by the 
wa y.  He was carr ying bricks anddoing things of  thatnature. He survi ved because he was 
young.  Ludva would not have survi ved exceptf or that. 
 
 
Andalso, they had
 
organized in J
asenovac 
--
 
which I know people think it'sf airly 
strange
,  
but they actually wanted to beentertained so they organized an orchestra
.  A
n d he  
played the violin.  He had been a leader of a
 
--
 
at home, bef ore thewar.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So anor
chestra m ade up of  the inm ates.
 
>> Dora Klaym an:  Yes.  There weren't many people who could play, but he could.  He could 

also conduct a choir.  So he m ade a choir. So that also savedm any becausethey would have 
a f ew hours of  respite. 
 
So between thetwo he survi ved.  He returned
 j
ust to see his wif e being 
denouncedand takenaway.  And hetried tofollow her.  Hef ollowed her to try get her released 

but was unsuccessful.
 
 
So you asked while they were both gone where was I.  I was with neighbors.  Ihad 
som e very good neighbors. 
 
>> Bill Benson: T his is the fam ily Runjaks?

Runjakswas a nurse and she spent much tim e curing T

disease quite ram pant in that area.  He was a painter.  Ordinary people. T hey hadthree 
children of whom  theoldest was already a teenager.  Andduring that tim e that I was with them  
and m y brother
.  M
y brotherand I actually called her mother because they were ever ywher e at 
th a t tim e.  
T hey were 
bivouacked 
in our backyard.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So this was a tim e when the 
Partisans
 
had been pushed out.
 
>> Dora Klaym an: Oh, y
eah.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Now you're back.
 
>> Dora Klaym an: W hich was mostof  the time anyway.  I know thatI called Mrs.
 
Run ja k s  
m other whenever there was anybody around.  My brother, who loved her, calledher Mother to 
theend of his time. So he was young enough notto know the switch backand forth, but I was 
able to do that.  I rem em bered.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And Iassumefor the Runjaks taking you in, you and your brother, was risky.
 
>> Dora Klaym an: It was risky on their part. Also,m any times when Aunt Giza and I

G iz a  
thought

didn't run away but thought it was dangerous. She parked us with other neighbors.  
A t time s, if I rem em b e r

I rem em ber being with a fam ily for like a day or t wo until danger of 
som e sort would pass. So it was a very

did people know where your AuntGiza had been taken?  She 
was not sent to Jas

>> Dora Klaym an:  Yes.  She was taken to Auschwitz.  Knew that because he f ollowed the trail 
andtried to get her out.  So there was a sense that she went to Auschwit z.
 
 
Inf act, since thism useum  received the archivef rom  Germ any, whic h was fairly
 
recent

>> Bill Benson:  In the last several years. 
 

>> Dora Klaym an:  Yes.  I put in the inform ation,and infact, received the cardon which it says 
that shedied.  Iassume they wrote of  that, ofsom e intestinalproblems in 1943. Soactually I 
think
 
they have Christm as 
D

>> Bill Benson:  And you've only really verif ied that recently.
 
>> Dora Klaym an: Only recently, ri ght.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So you are in the care of the Runjaks. Ljudevit is released

go i n g 
to school.

by 1944

I think it was 
actually during the time that Ljudevit was gone that I was told by the rem aining m em ber ofthe

20
 
Runjaksfam ily thatthe local priest came to 
Mr s .
 
Runjaks and said to her, "W hat are we going 
to do with these children?" Basically, you tried todo something or else they'll be gone
 
too.  So 
I was baptized at that tim e.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And your brother,
 
too, right?
 
>> Dora Klaym an:  Yes.  I think in1944,but I'm  not sure. 
 
 
I went to schoolearly.  I went to school
 
--
 
thatdoesn't sound early by American 
standards,butactually earlier than by Croatian standards atthe time.  But because they had 
s o m e i
nf luence, I started to going to school.
 
 
So I started going to schoolandtrying to do ever ything the rest of the children were 
doing:  going to church on Sundays, you know, played gam es a lot. I remember that we would 
separate into 
Partisans
 
and U
st a sa a
nd try toplay with corn
stalks.  Of course, Ludbreg is a 
sm all town in them iddle of a ruralarea. Andat thatpoint we had very l ittle, but we alwa ys had 

food.  I was never hungr y during the war thatI remember.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Because it was farm  count
r y.
 
>> Dora Klaym an:  Yeah.  W edidn't have fancy f oods, but we always hadf ood. Because it 
was a farm area. Andpeople would, you know, have their own chickens andthere were cows.  
So contrary to som eplaces, we were nothungr y.  Inf act, after the war
 
a lot of  people f rom  
Zagreb used to com eand just try to get somef arm  products. W ewere ok m ost times.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You described tom ethat that tim e after Ljudevit cam eback and it's the three 
of  you, until the endof the war in May
 
1945, that that was a period of  just constantf ighting 
between Ustasa andthe 
Partisans
.

21
 
>> Dora Klaym an:  Right.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And there you are in them iddle of  it.  And you rem em berthat.
 
>> Dora Klaym an: I rem ember that. Actually,  I think one of the striking memories was abattle 
thatoccurred even before Giza was takenaway.  I remember it so well because it was
 
--
 
o ur  
house was surrounded by
 
--
 
in our backyard at that point was oneforce.  Andacross the street 
on the secondf loor was anotherforce. I can't even remember whether the Ustasaor the 
Partisans
 
were inonehouse or the other.  And they were shooting at one another. W e were 
just there. All the bullets were f lying throughour windows.  It was very scary, of course.  Iwas 

cryin g.  
 
At one point 
Ljud
e vi t
 
got up to com eand seemebecauseI was cryi ng in the 
corner.  Anda bullet
 
--
 
thebattle startedbefore we could run away.  I'll tell in a bit where we 
usedto go,but that time we didn't getout in tim e.  So the bullets werefly
in g
.  T here was a 
bul
let that ended on his pillow.  And if  I hadn't been crying
 
--
 
I saved his life ina way.  He had 
c o m e.  
 
 
Most of thetime we wo uld have enough time to run into thebasement.  Andat one 
point whenthe battleswould continue, we stayed in the basement. Now, the basement was 
not an American
-
s t yl e
 
basem ent. It was a cellar.  You would have to get out of the house in 
order to go toopen the door throughthe cellar.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So expose yourself  going outside.
 
>> Dora Klaym an: Expose yourself
.  S o  a t t h
at time when this particular thing happened, we 
couldn't do that. Som etim es we were able todo that.  Sometimes we knew that there would be 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
22
 
another battle. W e would just stay go to sleep there. W ehad som e kind of cots.  Being akid, I 
loved to be sleep
ing in the basem ent
b
ecause there weref rogs. 
 
>> Bill Benson: W orms.
 
>> Dora Klaym an:  Jum ping around. W ehad a vineyard.  So there were big barrels with wine
, 
s
helves on which there were apples.W e stored apples. T he apples had tobe stored in a row 
so that they wouldn't touch oneanotherand that way they could bepreserved f or the winter.  
T here was a pileof  sand with carrots and turnips inside.  So it waskind of aplaygroundf or m e 
I th ou gh t.
 
>> Bill Benson: T he perspective of a 7
-
year
-
old.
 
>> D
ora Klaym an:  Not even 7.  I was probably 5, 6 atthat tim e. 
 
 
But,of  course,af ter the battles, in them orning, would look out and you didn't know 
who was in charge.  If  it was Ustasa, tim es were tough. And if  it was 
Partisans
, then we wer e 
f r ee .  
 
 
Bu
t sometimes the battles were just awf ul. There was onebattle inparticular that 
really raged through our streetand ended up at theend of the street in ahouse. The Ustasa 
were winning and the 
Partisans
 
were retreating.  Andfinally they were surrounded. They went 
into oneof  thehouses andexploded abom b in their m idst
 
and killedthem selves.  So m y 
street
,until recent changes, was called the Street of the 17th Brigade. T hat was
 
--
 
17th 
brigade was basically destroyed by the Ustasa atthat time.
 
 
An
d,of  course, the other thing is when you woke up inthe morning,you would take 
a lookat yourf urniture.  Ourfurniture,even after the war
,  
had hol
e
s in it. W ehad thisbig,

23
 
beautif ul arm oire.  It had holes in them .  Youwould take outthetable cloth and would put the 
table clothup.  It was like when children play with napkins and you tear it. This was how it 
wa s .
 
>> Bill Benson:  Bullet holesand shrapnel.
 
>> Dora Klaym an:  Yeah.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Now, thatall came to an endwith the end of the war in May
 
1945.  Do 
you 
rem em ber the war's end?  Andnow here'sLjudevit all alone.  Very f ew f amily m em bers have 
survi ved.  He's lost his wif e.  You've lost yourparents. W hat did hedo to try to rebuild a life? 
 
>> Dora Klaym an: W ell, the comm unity kindof  pulled together.  It was a very
 
--
 
it was new 
order.  Partisans hadwon.  Comm unist governm ent was in power. W ecertainly upset about it.  
It sounds like strange to say, but it was a governmentthatf oughtfor us andfor liberation. Not 
until later did
 
we start thinking about what this m eant in term s of Com munist government. But 
it was a governm ent that freed us or the group thatf reedus.
 
 
I do remember at the end of the war Ustasa being m arched throughthe town 
looking totally bedraggled andbeing led to whenever. T here aremany stories about what 

happenedaf terthe war in term sof how the governm ent dealt with them.
 
 
W e were, of course,f ree. And asfar asm y house is concerned, we 
b a s ica lly 
ended up having housekeepers. There were m aids. T here were several housekeepersthat I 
gre w up with later on
, s
om e of  whom  rem ainedf riendsfor a very long tim e.
 
 
Oneof  our housekeepers came because she had losteverything and she was 
highly educated.  Shewas my f irst piano teacher andm y f irst Germ an teache

T here were basically

m y unclenever rem arried.  So it was heandI growing up.  
My brother, who of  course survi ved with m e.  In 1946he contractedScarlet Fever along with 
two other boys in town.  Theother two boys survi ved but m y brotherdidn't. He passed away in 
Mrs .

hich was f ine f or m e, but 
it was a bit of aproblem for some otherpeople.

m y m oth e r'sfam ily.  
He survi ved

bothheandone of m yf ather'sbrothers, both survi ved as Germ an prisonersof  
war.  T hey were both in the Arm y when the Germ ans invaded.  So the Yugoslav Arm y was just 

whoever was there was taken to prisoner of war cam ps.  Andfortunately they were not treated 
nearly as badly as the Russian prisoners of war. T hat's another story, another awf ul story.  
T hey were im prisonedbut they were ok. T hey sur vi ved.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So cam e backaf terthe war.
 
>> Dora Klaym an:  Cam e back af terthe war.  Both of them decidedto
 
--
 
both m y m other's and 
m y f ather'sbrother decided that they would be going to Israel because they were allo wed to do

about
 b
ef ore you cl

>> Dora Klaym an:  Relative to that, yes. Andthe 
other
 
thing is thatwe had
 
--
 
because he had 
been sort of  f rom  a f am ily of  a
 
--
 
we had som ethings that we could still sell.  So at one point 
we also discovered that one other uncleof m ine survived
 
and another, 
f ather's brother. He 
had gonef rom  Croatia.  He escaped into Hungar y.  Andf rom Hungary, he was on that very 
infamousorf am ous transport. He andhis wife survi ved and then were taken to Switzerland.  
Andheeventually wrot e andfoundm eand then invitedm eto cometo visit them.  And 
because I was deem ed a victim  off ascism
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson: T he Comm unist saw you asa victim  of fascism .
 
>> Dora Klaym an:  Yeah.  That was m y title,victim  of fascism .  So Iwas allowed to goabroad.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n :  F o r avis it .
 
>> Dora Klaym an:  For a visit, which was unknown.  Im ean, whenIcam e back, I was givin g 
talks in every cl
a ss in  m y 
high school to tell them what life was likeout west.  
 
 
So I wentfor
 
am onth to Switzerland.  W e had to, of  course, sell whatever else we 
hadto getthe money just f orthe train. And Iwas allo wed
 
$5to take out.  It was a different 
world.
 
 
Anyway.  Butf or thef irst tim e Im et m yf am ily in Swit zerland
, a
n y o f m y f a m i ly.  
 
Strangely enough, they were 
O
rthodox Jews andI didn't have any idea whatthat meant. I 
a lwa ys kn e w I  wa s Je wish
 a
nd that I wasf orcibly converted.  But Ididn'tfollow anything af ter 
the war ended.  But I lived in that world.  I didn't know practically any other Jews.  Butnow I 

foundm yself  in thisorthodox wor ld.  Buttheywere very, ver y lo vely people. I really enjoyed

them . W e got along very well. 
 
T hey said, well, go back,
 
but why d on't you come to study once 
you are atthe university.  So that's what happened in 1957. And in1957 I was given 
perm ission to go study.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Again, because you were a victim  off ascism .  You could go study abroad.
 
>> Dora Klaym an:  Yes.
 
>> Bill Benson: T he idea is you would com eback though.
 
>> Dora Klaym an: Exactly.  I cam e back once.  So that countedf orm e. 
 
 
[Laughter]
 
 
So I went in 1957to study French at the University of  Lausanne. Of course,I didn't 
say what an em otionaltim e it wasf orm e tobegin with.  And I was looking forward to staying 

wi t h  
them . And,of  course, they had hadan incredibly diff icult time. And then trying to m ake a 
lif e in Switzerland.  And they had two little boys
, m
y ver y dear cousins whom  I'm  going to visit 
in two weeks in Israel.  They both lef tfor Israel eventually.
 
>> 
Bill Benson: W e don't have the tim e to gointo it,but as you'reon your wa y, you're onthe 
train and there's some young m en chatting.  You, who are a gif ted linguist
 
--
 
>> Dora Klaym an: W ell, I had been anEnglish major.  I was studying English in high 
sch oo l.   I  

was an English majorat the university the f irst year thatI was at the University of  Zagreb.  And 
I was dying to hear English and see if  I had learnedanything. T hey were arguing in the train 
about Little Rock. It was the time thatthe governor stoodandf orbid the entry to black children.  
And theother two wer e saying
