Q: And how old were yo
u when you realized that the war was over? 
A: When the war was over, I was 16 y
ears old. I was 17 in -- in June. 
Q: What can you tell me about the day th
at you realized that the war was over? 
A: This is -- this is really a question 
I always had a very  hard time to answer, 
because there were so many -- so many things in me. You know, first of all, I 
thought about my  parents. We didn™t have ou
r parents, we were alone, my sister and 
I and her husband. And then, you know, 
the relatives which we didn't know who 
survived and who not, who were in con
centration camps. And it -- it was just a 
wonderful feeling, but we were also very
 sad because we didn™t have our parents 
and other relatives, but it was still a wonder
ful feeling. And I -- I -- I can™t really 
explain it, ho-how wonderful it was. 

Q: When did you realize that the war was over? 

A: When I realized? When -- 
when -- when they 
-- they announced it. They -- we -- 
we were with the army, we were not alone
 when they 
announced that the war was 
over, because my sister got married on March 31
st
, 1945 with a 
Czech officer, a 
Jewish Czech officer, and we were with hi
m. We were with the army. So when the 

army announced that the war is over, for 
me the war was over. And that was mar -- 
May 9
th
, 1945 when  I heard that the war was over. 
Q: So you were w
ith the Czech army?

you were with the Czech army. 
A: Yes. 
Q: When  was the last time you were under Nazi control? 

A: I was under -- I was in -- that was 194
5 and we left -- ™44, when we left 
Russia
. 
In 
Russia
 we were not under the -- we left in , I 
think it was in ™43, we left under the 
Nazis and we came to 
Russia
. And we were in 
Russia
 and from 
Russia
 we left. It 
was o-on -- I know exactly, on Decemb er 24
th
, we left 
Russia
. And we ended up in 
Poland
, then in 
Czechoslovakia
. And that was the last time I was u nder the -- in -- 
in ™43 I was the last time under the -- 
you know, under the Nazi occupation. 
Q: And you mentioned that you went from 
Russia
 to 
Poland
 to 
Czec hoslovakia
. 
A: Yes, that™s exactly right. We went w
ith the Czech army and we actually went 
with the -- i-it was a co nvoy of tractors.
 And we went with the tractors to 
Poland
, 
and from 
Poland
 we escaped because where we were left was not a good place to 
be, we found that out very soon. And we ran away and we a-again got hold of a 

Czech army -- not any more the no -- what we
 were before, with a tractor of -- not 
tractor, with a -- a -- w ith just
 a car we got -- we got to 
Czechoslovakia
.

A: We didn™t have any opportunity to make
 any pra -- a-any kind
 of inquiry until the 
war was completely over. And then only -- re
ally we couldn™t go anywhere, but our 
husbands went. You know, I was, in the 
meantime I got married and our husbands 
went, we couldn™t even go. Because it wasn
™t -- it -- it still was not -- you couldn™t 
go as a ci-civil person you coul
dn™t go to any different coun
try. And we had to go to 
a different country. So our husband
s went and they got our parents. 
Q: Okay , let me ask you about your husba
nd. How did you meet him and wh at were 
the circumstances? 
A: My husband I met when  my
 sister marrie d  her husband. He was the best ma n. He 
was a very, very nice gu-guy, and when I 
met him, my  brother-in-law said, you can 
ask him if you want to ride
 the horse. He can get it fo
r you. And he was 10 years 
older than  me and he just put his hands on
 my cheek and he said, oh you are a nice 
little girl. I had braids and I 
really looked like a little girl
 in comparing to him. And 
anyway, that™s how I met him, 
and then, in th -- 
when my sister got married and all, 
once he sent my  brother-in-law and my  sister
 away and he came to
 visit me. I w as in 
the Czech army. Every officer had a 
spoika. 
A
 spoika
 means a helper, and I was 
left in the place with a 
spoika. 
And wh en my  late husband came to visit me, he told 
the 
spoika
 that he cou -- has off. And he want
ed to kiss me and I wouldn™t allow 
him, I really hit him, you know? And then
 he didn™t come any mo re and then  he

wanted to marry me. And when
 we went -- it was after the war and when  we went to 
get married , I couldn™t because I was too 
young. So we didn™t ge
t married. But then 
he was transferred to a place and he becam
e them -- their -- he -- he was -- I -- I 
don™t really know how you sa
y it in English. He was a biggest man the army  had in 
that town. And that was the town where was a German -- lot of Germans lived, and 
they were transported 
away, to go back to 
Germany
. And this is where -- where we 
came, and he was the big shot there. We ha
ve number one, that we was the first ones 
to get married in that little 
town and nobody gave us a hard time. I h ad -- of course, 

I had to get -- what do you call 
it, somebody to  take care of
 me because I didn't have 
my  -- my  parents, and my  sister couldn™
t -- couldn™t have done it. You know, you 
have to have a -- l-like your father, you 
know, who would give 
you permission. And 
my  late husband had an  uncle and gave me
 permission and we got married there, in 

that little town. This was 
Freiwa ldau
 in -- in -- in the czechoslo -- in 
Czechoslovakia
. And that -- that happ
ened  only on August 28,
 1945. The -- first we 
wanted to get married in June, when I turn
ed  17, but we couldn™t.
 So  th en  wh en  h e  
got transferred and all, and then , you know
, wh en he got there he had us come and 
we got married. 
Q: What was his name ? 
A: His name was 
Robert Kauder, R-o-b-e-r-t  K-a-u-d-e-r
.

Q: So all in all, how 
long did you know him be
fore you married him? 
A: I knew him from March until I married hi
m, until I -- I married him in August. 
You see, you have to  understa
nd. When  they came back, there was no Jewish girls, 
you know, there were no Jews when they came
 back. He had an aunt there and that -
- that™s a whole story in itself you -- 
you know, she was at home and her husband 
was in -- in 
Theresienstadt
. He was in the camp the w
hole time, and he came back. 
But wh en  he went to see his aunt, he found
 out that his mother 
and his sister  were 
taken to 
Auschwitz
 an d that -- that they died. And 
he was extremely sad. And then 
he wanted to get married, 
when  he found out that he doesn™t have an ybody. And 
there really -- there really was nobody, we were -- it was 
very easy, really, to get 
married tha-that time, you 
know, I mean, it -- you didn
™t have anybody, like we 
didn™t have our parent, and I married him. 
I didn™t know th at my  parents are alive. 
Even so, the war was over in May. We
 still had no idea until -- I was married 
already to him when we found out where th
ey are. That was through the Red Cross, 
cause we had no idea where my
 -- we didn™t have any idea if our -- my parents are 
alive. And we did not find them wher
e we left them, w e found them in 
Bukarin
, 
which is a capital of 
Romania
 and we left them in the 
Bukovina
, completely 
different place. But my uncle -- my father had three brothers in the 
United States 
and only one really cared to si -- send lette
rs and ch ecking if we are alive. And the

first one they found was me, and I got a 
letter and there was 25 dollars in it. And 
then my sister, I think got it, and then so
mehow we got to know 
that our parents are 
in 
Ro ma nia
, and then when  our husbands went
 to get. That mu st have been 
someplace either end of ™45, or beginning 
of ™46 because it was 
cold outside when 
they came. But I -- I don™t know th e exact date when th ey came, I really can™t 
remember. But I know I was married and I 
got married on August
, like I said, 28, 
1945. So they weren't there.
 When they came, I was married, you know, so it could 
have been end of the ™45 
or beginning of ™46, I 
really don™t remember.  
Q: At the age of 17, did you feel you were ready for marriage? 
A: I had no idea what marriage is. I had ab
solutely no idea. I 
remember what I -- I 
didn™t have anything, and my  late husba
nd, a-and -- it was hard, you know, to buy 
something, and he wanted to make a me
 a dowry. And all I wanted was a -- a 
nightgown from flannel, because I never, ev
er wore a -- a nightgown. So I thought 
that™s what I need is a big, long nightgown
. That™s what I want. 
And he did ge -- get 
-- you -- you know, a dowry for me, because
 I didn™t have a
nything, nothing. I 
didn™t have nothing, just what I wore. An d go -- he got me whatever, and my -- my 

brother-in-law got some lace and 
his sister,  who came back from 
Auschwitz
, sh e 
was actually an -- you know, she used to
 make clothes. And she didn™t have a 
machine or anything. And sh e made me a gown for my  wedding. It is a short gown.

It was a sh ort -- wasn™t enough material. And I don™t think I -- I -- I don™t know, I 
don™t feel I have -- I don™t have a picture 
here, but it™s very funny the way -- it looks 
nice. It™s -- it was nice. It
 was really ve-very nice.  
Q: You mentioned a few mo ments ago that 
your husband was the 
-- the big boss in -
- 
A: The big boss, 
yeah, in -- in 
Freiwa ldau,
 in 
Grafenberg-Freiwaldau
 it was 
called, where we were.
 Freiwaldau
 was the city and 
Grafenberg 
was a -- i -it w as 
there an institution for peop
le who have troubles with their brains. It was at 
Grafenberg
. And we lived actually on the way up
 Grafenberg
. We had a beau tiful 
house, but we -- we -- i-it was a b eautiful, 
beautiful house, and we lived there. And 
in 1997 I went with my gran
ddaughter to see the place, I went back. And there lived 
-- there lived some people. And I said -- 
it was raining outside, and I have there a 
cousin and she took us. And wh en I rang the 
bell I said, I used to live here. He said, 
you couldn™t have lived here. Here lived a 
young girl who is a chief of the army . I 
said, that was me. And he let us go in. 
Was nice. It was really nice. I had my 
granddaughter. Was very nice to go back .  

Q: Do you remember your
 husband™s military rank? 
A: It -- here it was a -- a -- a captain or a -- a -- a major. I think he got the major 

after, I don™t really remember. 
I don™t remember. It was not 
[indecipherable]
 he

was not -- I think he got -- he was a major. 
H e was a captain when I met him, and I 
think then he got -- he got a major. I™m not
 hundred percent, I think that™s what 
happened . 
Q: When  you got married and 
lived in this house that yo
ur remember so fondly -- 
A: Yes? 
Q: -- how were you treated by the -- by your neighbors? 

A: You know, I did not associate, actua
lly, with the neighbor
s, only with the 
military. And we -- but what we did have 
was a maid. And she was a Czech and she 
was nice. I had no problem, 
and her husband did in th e ga
rden. We had a beau tiful 
garden  with  the pool and ev erything was ve
ry nice, very, very nice. I had no -- no 
problems really. A matter of fact I had a lo
t of fun because when  the -- when  one of 
the soldiers would come to us with someth
ing for my  husband, and if I would go to 
the door, if I would open th
e door, they always wanted to make a date with me, 
because I still had the braids, I still didn™t cu
t my braids, and they didn™t think that -- 
that I am th e wife of -- of the -- of the 
velitel. Velitel
, I don™t know how you say it. 
Yeah, the big shot, whatever. It was very 
nice. Very nice life there, very nice.  
Q: And what exactly were his duties and responsibilities? 
A: I really don™t know exactly his duties, but they were -- they -- 
they had to get rid 
of the Germans, which y-you know, ta
ke me away from there. It was the

Sudetenland
 where we were, you kn
ow, traveled over the 
Sudeten land
. He did 
that, and whatever else he had to do. I-I r
eally never -- I never discussed it. I never 
discussed it. I -- what -- what we did firs
t, before we did anything was we were 
trying to  -- we went to 
Freiwa ldau
 and we also were trying to think that I will go 
back to school, because I didn™t finish sch ool. But then they to
ld me that I won™t 
have any ch ildren. I didn't know if I could 
or I couldn™t, I mean I had no idea. And 
when  I heard no children, how could I be 
without no children, I always wanted 12. 
So I went from one doctor to another, a
nd that was when I was already -- when I 
was in school already when  I 
found out. And I started to 
go to medical school. I had 
no problems. I took a test and I started to 
go. But then  there was one time, the first 
time where we had an  autopsy. It was a 
newborn baby, and when  they took the 
[indecipherable]
 they cut the head, I started to m-move around a little, and 
professor said, Miss 
Kauder
, will you please stand up straight? And I couldn™t, 
because I wa-wa-was already crying when I 
w -- w-when I just tried to stand up. 
And he said, are you a -- a -- what do you sa
y, a -- a cry -- an hysterical woman, or -
- or what -- wh-what™s wrong with you?
 I said, I™m a mother. I was pregnant 
already. And then I did -- the first semest
er w as over, and I didn™t go then back. 
Also my husband got sick and I di
dn™t go back to school. But I was --

Q: Why did you think you 
couldn™t have children? 
A: I didn't know. It was the first time I 
went to a docto r, I had some problems. You 
know, i-i-i -- I just had some problems and 
my husband wanted me
 to go, so I went. 
And we didn™t want to have
 any ch ildren. We had no pr
oblems with having ch ildren 
or not having. We didn™t -- because we said
, first I™ll finish sc
hool and th en we™ll 
have a family. But when they
 said I can™t have any children, I don™t have to wo rry 
about that, I th -- to me that was a very 
big worry. I -- and I went from town to town 
until I got a very old doctor and he said
, you are so young. He says, the only time 
you can have it is now. And that was true 
because then I had -- after my daughter 

was born, I had a -- two miscarriages, then
 I had my son. It™s almost six years 
different between my  daughter and my  s
on. And when  I had my  son it was really 

very -- they told me that the only way I ca
n have him, if I am going to lie quietly 
until I feel him, and then, you know, I c
ould get up. And the doctor who knew me, 
h-he says, you know, yo
u can do that. I said, of course 
I can do that. And I did it. I 
didn™t move until I felt him, and I had him.  

Q: You also mention th at your hu
sband was having health problems. 
A: My husband got the -- was wounded in 1944 at 
Dukla
, that was in 
Russia
. And 
when he was -- when he was -- it was so 
sad, his whole -- his whole wounding was a 
very sad thing. They  had wh at they called 
spoika
, which meant that a soldier had to 

 
Interview with Erika Eckstut  
 
January 16, 2002 
 

 
 
13
go and tell another soldier that
 something is not right, y
ou have to  be careful. And 
the soldier who was to go was 
Max Weiss
. And he co uldn™t -- he couldn™t, he -- he 
just collapsed. And the officer who was surro
unded, wherever he was, was my  late 
husband™s best friend. So he started to go
, but he didn™t have to go, he was the 
adjutant to 
Swoboda. 
He didn™t have to go nowhere,
 and they said, don™t go. You 
know, the general told him, don™t go.
 And he d -- he saw that yo-you know
, Max 
Weiss
 couldn™t go, he comp letely collapsed. So
 he run and when  he ran, they say, 
crawl. H-He was very tall, he says, you cr awl. They -- when they
 ho-hollered at him 
and he -- he started to crawl, fell in -- in
 the -- in the bunker where his friend was 
and all, and he did tell them what happened
. But then  they didn™t have any x-ray and 
what they  looked  was that he was wounded in the kidney. Bu t the kidney wasn™t 
touched, it looked fine. So they just sewe
d him up. And that was 
in ™44, and in ™46 
he started to have problem,
 and he had terrible problems
 til the day he died. He had 
eight operations. He had -- they didn™t have
 at that time like now, you know, that 
they can give you -- I forgot what it™s calle
d. He had artificial
 kidney and it didn™t 
help. And he finally, you know, died only -- it 
was in 1957. It was a terrible, terrible 
time. But he was good. He went in the hosp
ital, he was in the hospital a month or 
whatever. Came home, the first thing he 
did is made -- made ar-arrangements and 
we went to the -- to a show, or wh
atever. Never, every complained. Never 

 
Interview with Erika Eckstut  
 
January 16, 2002 
 

 
 
14
complained that he had to be
 in the hospital, that it -- at one time he had to have, 
you know, to wear a thing, 
and nothing bothered him. Bu
t he couldn™t make it. I 
always said to the doctor. You just do wh
at you can do, he™ll do what he can do. 
And they  couldn™t -- they -- they  just couldn™t. He was -- one time -- my  son, 
unfortunately inherited what my  husband ha
d -- had. And he was a year old when he 
was taken to the hospital, and he had two 
stones. And he was breastfed. He was 13 
months old and then , six months later, he 
was taken again and they  had to enlarge 
him the passage from the kidney  to the 
blad der. And th e operation was taking about 
four and a half hour. It was a very, very 
big operation. And he still has to go for -- 
you know, and he was, in 1949
 -- ™89, I was very ill and he had to go to the hospital 
too, he had problems. My son. 

Q: I™m a little confused  about something. 
Did your husband die as a result of this -- 
of being wo unded, or did he have a
nother medical condition, or was it a 

combination? 
A: No, he died of -- of his wounding. 
When  they opened the -- the kidney, you 
know, that happened in 1947,
 when they opened
 it. In ™46 he started to have 
problem, and when  the couldn™t find anything and they  couldn™t see anything, they 

opened him and the kidney wa
s a piece of pus. And the other kidney  was already 
attack, unfortunately. If they woul
d have taken out the kidney in 
Russia
 when  he 

 
Interview with Erika Eckstut  
 
January 16, 2002 
 

 
 
15
was wounded, nothing would have happened
. He lived -- we -- I 
also live with one 
kidney. He could have lived the longest time 
for -- with one kidney. I wanted to give 
him my  kidney. I didn™t know th at I -- eventually I my self had kidney problems and 
I lost a kidney, I didn™t know it then. But th
en  I wanted  to give him the kidney -- in 
France
 they had just made -- had a ki -- a case
 with twins, they 
gave from one twin 
to the other, and they  didn™t make it. And th
ey wouldn™t do it because at that p o int, 
you know, I had already my  da
ughter, I didn™t have my  s
on yet, but they would not 
do th at, they would not take my  kidney and give it to him. And they  couldn™t do it -- 
they didn™t do it because the only case 
they had was at that time in -- in 
France
 and 
it didn™t work. What they didn't have is
 the -- what do you call -- I -- I can™t 
remember. I™ll remember maybe in the course
 of th -- I will tell you what it™s called. 

What -- his -- his case was called -- he had 
cy sten u r ia .
 That -- that what this stones 
were, 
cysten
 stones. But that was caused. They 
could -- they also didn™t have any 
relatives of his to check i
f, let™s say there was somethi
ng in the family, but they 
don™t know about anything. So  th
ey only -- they -- their case 
is that he died from the 
wounding. 

Q: I had asked you before if
 you had mu ch contact with 
your neighbors and you said 
no, but did the people of th
e town know th at you and 
your husband were Jewish?

A: You know, I -- I was thinking about it. I 
really don™t know if they knew. There 
was no -- in that little town, there was no 
temple or anything, and you couldn™t 
really do there anything. Wh atever you did, 
you did in  the house. I mean, the -- the 
maid could have known, but 
I -- I don™t know. I really ha
ve no idea. I do -- I really 
don™t know.  
Q: Were there other Jews in the town? 

A: No. There were no -- excep
t my aunt. We -- we took my aunt and my uncle, 
because my uncle, like I said, he was in -- in  the camp, he came back to on -- that 

was not -- they were living in 
Ostrow
, not where we lived.
 
So my  husband took 
them to 
Freiwaldau
 and he kept them there. But th
ey -- he wasn™t Jewish, her -- her 
husband, she was the one who was Jewish. An
d in 40 -- in ™28, 
or when they got 
married, he converted. He also was circumcised. So -- so --

have anything that happened to you during
 the war, any illness or accidents or any 
kinds of problems that presented you with  an
y health issues at the end of the war? 
A: I -- I was beaten at the place where we 
were taken when we we
re supposed to go 
to the concentration camp. And my back wasalways in very bad sh ape. It still is. 

Q: Did you get any medical care, either dur
ing the war or immediately after the war 
for your back? 

A: No, I didn™t get any -- any medical care 
and one of the reasons was that really 
and truly I-I -- very, very early after we 
got married, my husb
and got sick. And I 
was so worried about him that I just -- and 
I was young. And I just said ah, I™ll make 
it, I™ll make it and I never -- I never really did do anything ab out it. 
[indecipherable]
. No, as we get older, it ge
ts worse, but I mean -- 
Q: You also mentioned that there were 
Germans in the town  and part of your 
husband™s responsibility was to ge
t -- get them out of the town. 
A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: Did you personally witness any acts 
of retribution or retaliation against 
collaborators or any Germans that were there? 
A: No, I didn™t. I just heard from -- fro -- oh, you all right? 
[indecipherable]
. My 
husband was -- was n o t telling me really, 
but his friends who were there, some 

wanted to -- to do so mething to them. A
nd my  husband wouldn™t even touch them, 

 
Interview with Erika Eckstut

18
and would not allow that a
nything -- y-you know, he -- he™s just wouldn™t even  
touch them. He was so mad that he wouldn™t touch them. 
Q: You also mentioned befo re about attemp
ts to find your parents, you didn™t know 
where they were and they -- you left them 
in one place and they ended up in an other 

place. Did you put your name
 on a list of survivors? 
A: No, I didn™t. I didn™t put my  name any 
place. That da -- that what -- was w h at my 
uncle did. H-He had here three brothers, 
but only one did it. He -- he put all our 
names down. My father™s, my mother™s, my
 sister™s and my 
-- m-my and myself, 
and my  name. Of course, his parents too, 
but they -- they were unfortunately, you 
know, they died. 

Q: Are you telling me that he put down y
our names that he wa
s looking for you? 
A: Yeah, after the war, you know. He did th
at. I didn™t have anything to do with it, I 
just got a letter with 25 dollars. 
That™s all I got from my uncle.  
Q: What was your reaction, you and your si
ster, when you heard th at your parents 
were alive? 
A: Oh, wa-wa-what should I tell you? We st
arted to dance and we
 didn™t know what 
to do. We were ready to go
 right away, but we couldn
™t, and our husbands went. 
You know, they -- they were both in the 
uniform, they was -- were still, you know 

and they  went.

Q: Did you have any co rrespondence with 
your parents before your husbands went 
to -- to collect them? 
A: I don™t think so. I really don™t reme mb
er it. I don™t rememb er having any because 
right away they went. And you see, when 
they came back, the 
house where I told 
you we lived -- my sister was with me th
at time, and -- and we were waiting for our 
parents to come. And we lived on a hill 
up, and it™s a -- we heard the car comin g . 
And our -- our top was like a -- ju-just a pl
ain top and we saw the car way down. So 
I started to run down  and I ran th ree steps 
I took at once and my sister went slower. 
And I was there before my si
ster. And when the car didn™t 
even stop when my father 
came out. And my  father was wounded in th
e first World War, and he walked with a 
cane. And I heard my mother say 
den stock, den stock
, the cane. And he didn™t take 
it. He was in my arms, I was in his and we
 were just holding. And he never took the 
cane again. But unfortunately, 
he didn't  live too lo ng, you
 know. He died when he 
left 
Czechoslovakia
. 
Q: When  was that? 

A: That was in 1949 -- fo -- no, 40 -- ™49 
in -- yeah, ™49 in March, I think it was. 
Yeah. ™49 or ™48, I don™t know if it was ™48 or ™49, I don™t remember. Either ™48 or 
™49, because they were
 looking for it -- the reason my pa
rents had to leave, my sister 
had left. But my  parents had to leave beca
use they were looking for a German baron 

 
Interview with Erika Eckstut  
 
January 16, 2002 
 

 
 
20
and he looked like my father, and my fath
er, who knew the policeman who came to 
us, he says, you know me. He
 says, you know my  -- my  parents. You -- you know 
me, I™m not from no baron. He says, all I have
 to do is take my  pants down . He said 
not with the Russians, you don™t. He said, 
because some, you know, had it done too, 
you know to -- so my -- they
 gave my  father a diploma
tic passport and he left for 
Vienna
. And five weeks later he died. And when  he died he had th e same thing 
which he -- which he had two times before. On
ce when he left our little town, first -- 
he had the first heart attack. Then  he had one in 
Prague
 where I came. And the third 
one he had, he said my  s
unshine is not here. He says
, don™t call anybody and sure 
enough he -- he didn™t -- he didn't have -- 
Q: And who was his sunshine? 
A: I was. I was both times w
ith him and that was it.  
Q: Did your parents say anyt
hing to you or make any co
mment about the fact that 
their sons-in-law came to pick them up, 
they didn't  even k
now that you were 
married? 

A: Yeah, oh did they make th -- did they  
make comments, of course. And th eir first 
comment to me was that he has to an
nounce the weddings. I mean, it™s not a 
wedding. He says, you know cannot say -- 
how can you take anybody else if your 

parents are alive? You know, I had a 
formant
 -- what -- what do you c -- I -- I don™t 

 
Interview with Erika Eckstut

21
know what you call it, 
formant
, you know, somebody w
ho talks for me. But you 
had to -- probably you 
had to say. I -- I didn™t fill out 
any papers, my husband did. I 
don™t know what he said there, that I don™t 
have my  parents. They  had to be dead, 
you had to have -- and my  father was a lawy
er. He says, you know, I -- I™ll have that 
done in no time. But he love
d my  husband, but -- and I said, but I don™t want it. I 
really don™t want it, and anyway  he didn™
t do it. But then he 
w -- he -- he did one 
thing, which was so nice, wh
en he, for me w h en I was 18
, he aw -- w-went to court 
and he initiated the case that 
they should forgiv e me my age and give me -- because 
we had still ta -- we got food on ration,
 because there was not food. And I got 
children™s ration. I had already a daughte
r, I was breastfeeding. So -- and I couldn't 
go with them anywhere for drink or anythi
ng. When they went I had to stay out 
[indecipherable]
 outside. So he -- he did that. I have that document.  
Q: When did you realize the 
full extent of the genocide? 
A: I -- I really realized that
, I think very early, my sister
 and I. We never talked to 
our parents what we went through. We ne
ver told them, they 
never to ld us how 
come that from the 
Buko v i na
 they  ended up in -- in 
Buch arest.
 How did they get to 
Bucharest
? Why did they g -- were they there.
 I have no idea. Neither does my  
sister, we never, ever talked about it. I 
think we all knew what happened. We all 

knew exactly what happened and 
we didn™t want to talk about it. We just didn™t. We 

 
Interview with Erika Eckstut  
 
January 16, 2002 
 

 
 
22
just tried hard to make life as possible lik
e other people. It wasn™t easy, you know, 
it™s very, very hard. And e-ev
en  w h en  you  ask  me w h en  
I was 17 if I knew wh at the 
marriage was, I had no idea what the marri age was, absolutely none. And we just 
wanted to  be loved. And we tried to make 
life as best as we knew how. But I never 
talked to my parents about it, never, and ne
ither did my  sister. Neither did th ey ca -- 
talk to us about it at all.
 And I know it was only beca
use we knew what happened. I 
mean, at that point of cour
se we knew wh at happened . 

Q: How did you know what had happened? 
A: From -- from what I went through, I -- I knew that. I -- I mean I knew what -- 

what went on all along. I mean, I was there, 
it™s not that I didn™t -- if I would have 
been hidden  or something they  wouldn™t ha
ve known, but I was exposed to it, and I 
-- so I knew it. 

Q: Had you heard during th e war about 
Auschwitz
 and some of the other -- 

A: 
Auschwitz
 I never heard. I -- I don™t -- I don™t think I her -- but I knew that there 
were camps and I knew it wa
s bad. Why did I run to 
Russia? 
Q: Were you aware of any 
deaths of Jews, survivors, after the war was over? 
A: After the war was over, yes, I remember
 too, was -- I heard that some people 
who came back and they didn™t find anybo
dy, they committed suicide. And yeah, it 
w -- it was a terrible th ing. It™s -- yeah, I 
heard some people, you know th ey -- they 

 
Interview with Erika Eckstut  
 
January 16, 2002 
 

 
 
23
commit, you know, was -- it was a terrible thing. It was awful, I rememb er. Some of 
the -- yeah, my father came in ™46, be
cause in ™46 was the first time we had 
Passover in our house, and th
e so ldiers which work with
 my -- they -- they were 
officers, you know, were in the same thing 
with my  husband. They  all came to our 
house, because we were the only ones wh
o had parents. And my father was, of 

course, in -- in charge of the Passover. We 
-- he really -- och, tha-that was -- w e 
have two people who were with -- with us
 when my father co
nducted the Passover, 
and th-they are in 
New York.
 That was so nice, that 
was so nice, my father 
conducted -- that was in -- in
 ™46. Oh, that was such a nice Passover. Was very, very 
nice, and we had -- i-it was -- I don™t even
 rememb er how many people were th ere, 
but there were all, you know, his friends an
d all, they all came to us. He was the 
only one who could make a Passover.  

Q: You mentioned they  were your husband
™s friends, they were the officers -- 
A: Yes, 
[indecipherable]
 officers from the army. 
Q: Were there many Jewish officers in the army? 

A: Yeah, there was, because they -- they we
re about -- at least six or seven came. At 
least. I-I -- I really don™t remember how 
many there were, but there were a -- there 
were a lot, and they were talking about it fo
r years to come and today if you talk to

him, he w -- he will tell you, you know, 
he was at -- for Passover, you know, at 
Neuman™s 
house.  
Q: You were one of th e few to have pare
nts that come back. And you mention th at 
you did not speak about the war -- 

A: No, no.  

Q: -- with your parents. But did your pa
rents offer you any guidan ce or any wo rds 
of wisdom to help you re
build life after the war? 
A: I -- I think, you know 
in  their -- th-th-they  were extremely loving and giving 
people. And they gave you a lot without ev
en you realizing. Th
-They did help you, 
without you being aware of it, because 
I remember things, you know, where -- 
where they would -- li-like for example,
 I remember when my  daughter, she 
wouldn™t eat at all. And I would sit there 
and sit and everything
 would fly. I would 
bake all kinds of things and she wouldn™t eat -- she would put it in one cheek and 
the other cheek. And when I hold her nose
 she spit it out. And I was sitting there and 
sitting and in one time, you 
know, when she spit it out, I 
just slapped her, you know, 
on the face. And my father went white. Imean, he went white. 
I have never seen 
him like that, and he walked away. And then
 later on he took me aside and he says, 
where did you ever see touching a child ? I said, but she doesn™t -- she doesn™t 
swallow. And my  father, you know, had a 
very long talk with me. And th en the 

 
Interview with Erika Eckstut  
 
January 16, 2002 
 

 
 
25
other long talk we had was when  he realiz
ed that I did not speak German to my 
mother. And my mother, unfortunately didn ™t speak much Czech, she was not Czech 
and we never spoke Czech in the house, 
we always spoke German. And he sat me 
and my  sister down and he had a talk with
 us. And he says, you can™t be the way 
you are. Why don™t you speak with your 
mo ther the way you always spoke? And I 

said, I have nothing what to say in -- w
ith my father I coul
d speak Czech, because 
he spoke Czech very well, too. And I said
, m -- I -- I don™t have anything to say in 
German, what -- why should I speak Germ
an? I don™t want to speak German. He 
said, why don™t you want to speak Ge
rman? I said, because I don™t like the 
language. He said, what did 
th e language do to you? I said, I don™t want to talk 
about it. He said, but I want to talk abou
t it. I said, I don™t. He said, do you realize 
that if you hate, then 
Hitler
 won the war? He says, you can™t do that. The language 
didn™t do anything to you. And he talked 
to us. My sister was always smarter than I, 

she was also older, and she got it before 
I got it. And one time I was very bad, 
because he wouldn™t let loose. My sister
 wasn™t like me, she 
also spoke to my 
mother. And I g -- I just got up and left. 
An d  my  mo th er immed i ate l y  came to  me 

and says, would you please 
go back and apologize? I said no. She said, will you go 
back and apologize? And I did go back  an
d apologize, and I did si -- it took me 
awhile, and I started to speak to my mo ther in German. And it -- th-that was the 

 
Interview with Erika Eckstut  
 
January 16, 2002 
 

 
 
26
only time that we spoke about the war, and my  
father made sure that I have no hate 
in my heart, and I still don™t. I don™t know
 what it is to really hate. I don™t hate 
anybody. I never did and I can™t hate. I 
don™t like what happened. I am not, you 
know, the person who can forgiv e anything. 
I™m not such a big person, I don™t like 
what happened. Bu t I don™t hate. And I tried 
to prove it to my father, too. He wasn™t 

here any mo re, and I st -- always try to do 
the right thing. I have always tried -- the 
first time that I came across a German girl
 in the school, I -- I did everything I had 
to do for her. And then she invited me to
 go to her wedding, and I went. But I said, 
Daddy, I™m doing th is for you, and anyway
 -- it wa -- th ey -- they were both very, 
very loving, my  parents. They were su -- 
such nice, easy peop
le to get along with. 
Very, very nice people, very loving, very 
loving. That was very nice. Where am I 
now? Where was I really
 when I told you? 
Q: In addition to  the advice that your 
parents gave you after the war, did your 
parents -- you mentioned somethi
ng ab out going back to school. 
A: Yeah, that -- 

Q: Tell me where, exactly, you went back to school. 

A: I went back to school in 
Prague
, because that was, you know, we left 
Prague
, I 
think it was in December or whenever, when
ever he was -- he -- he was already in 
Freiwaldau
, we got married in 
Freiwa ldau
, but I was still -- you know, I was with 

 
Interview with Erika Eckstut

27
him, and we -- I had -- just I took the te
st, you know. And the end -- the -- it started 
in September, started to school. And I went to school in 
Prague
 and I went to 
school, you know, I continued. I was 
with my sister, she was in -- in 
Prague
, I was 
with her. And I went through the first -- th
e first part, an d then I didn™t go. And the 
professor I took wher
e -- I mean, I took 
[indecipherable]
 I had, he came once to
 
Prague -- 
to 
New York
. A neighbor of ours was waiting for a niece who came from 
Prague
, she was my friend. And he never knew
 her, he knew her as a little girl. And 
she came with her husband and her son. A
nd he wanted me to go with him if I 
would recogni -- of course I recognized him.
 So I went with him and as we were 
standing upstairs and the people go out -- 
come out, you know after they go through 
the -- the -- wh-whatever they have 
to go when they 
come from a -- 
Q: Customs? 

A: Customs. So I said, here she is. And 
right behind her was a man with a -- wi -- li-
like a moustache, and I look and I -- I know 
the guy. I mean, I know him. He is a 
professor I had years ago. So I was waiti
ng, and when  she came out her uncle went 
t-to her and my aunt was there and all. An
d I went over to the guy and I asked him 
in Czech if he is Czech. He says, of cour
se I am, he says, how do you know? I says, 
I™m your pupil. He said, I can™t believe 
it. And th en, you know,
 he -- slowly he 
reme mb ered  me an d  he wen t to  
Ch icago.
 And I said, could you come and stay with 

 
Interview with Erika Eckstut  
 
January 16, 2002 
 

 
 
28
us after you are finished? He went to a lect
ure. He said, I would love to, but I have 
no money. I said, doesn™t matter, I says, 
I™ll give you some money and you™ll come 
and stay with us. And he came and he stayed
 with us. He was in my house and I was 
already married to my husband, but my hu
sband didn™t have a 
job yet, you know, 
that™s a long story. Anyway  -- 
Q: This is with a different husband -- 

A: It™s a different -- 
Q: -- you™re -- you™re jumpin
g a little bit ahead of you. 
A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
Q: Did you want to stay in 
Czechoslovakia
 after the war? 
A: I had no choice, becau
se my husband was very ill.
 I could not have gone 
anywhere. Because also what I didn™t te
ll you, in -- in December of ™44 --  
™45, a cousin of my  late husband came to 
Freiwa ldau
 where we were, and he 
wanted to  take ma -- he had every doc
uments for my  husband to go to the 
United 
States
. And at that time he wasn™t ill yet. 
A nd my husband said he won™t go, he 
won™t leave me. He says, you don™t have to
 leave her. We™ll -- we -- you™ll divorce 
her and I™m going to  marry her, or my  chauffeur is going to marry her, just you 
know, for formal. And we go to 
-- they were in, I think in 
Belgium
 they were 
stationed. And my  husband said, I am not 
going to divorce her and nobody is going 

 
Interview with Erika Eckstut  
 
January 16, 2002 
 

 
 
29
to marry her but me. And he wouldn™t go. An
d he didn™t go. I would have liked to 
go out. My sister left, my  parents le
ft. I was the only 
one l-left there. 
Q: You told me how your father left and 
went. What about your sister, when did she 
leave, an-and under what circumstances? 
A: My sister -- my -- my brother-in-law ac
tually deserted the 
army, he was in the 

army and he just left to 
Israel
 to help with the 
Haganah. 
And of course that™s also 
another story. When  he came to 
Israel
 they wouldn™t take him. He was 15 years 
older than  my  sister, he was 38 or 39 when
 he came  there and he didn™t speak any 
Hebrew. And he had a very hard  tim
e learning a language. He was from 
Czechoslovakia
 from the mountains, and he spok
e Hu ngarian and Czech. We never 
spoke Hungarian, we were not from that 
part. And he couldn™t learn right away the 
Hebrew, so he had also  problems in -- in 
Israel
.
 
What -- they left right when -- 
when the communist came, becau
se the o -- the other reason they le -- he left also 
was that a lot of Jewish officers were 
killed right after the communists took over. 
Not only Jewish, but some were Jewish, you 
see, quite a few. Was right in there and 
o-other, you know -- then 
Moro vitz
 was there who was killed, he was married to a 
Jewish lady who was pregnant when she 
-- when he got killed. It was terrible, 
because 
Swoboda
 did not go with -- with -- with 
the communists, he didn™t do 
anything to help them, and the army  didn™t want to go. The army  was already, I 

 
Interview with Erika Eckstut

30
mean they could have taken them on. They  we
re still in -- in ge
ar. But they was -- so 
everybody who could, left. B
ecause the officers who left 
didn™t have 
no permission, 
they didn™t leave from th
e army, they just left. You know, not legally. 
Q: I™m not sure I understood all that you just said. When  the communists came -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- some of the Czech officers were -- were killed. 

A: All the 
[indeciphera ble]
 were killed. Some of the Czech officers were killed. 
Q: Why? 

A: Why? They said they are against th-the 
prolat -- proletariat. They are against the 
Russians, or whatever, to 
-- you know, whatever they 
had -- whatever reason they 
had, they  -- they didn™t -- they didn™t lik
e them and they killed them. It was, you 
know, they always -- they had a reason, you
 know, they said th
ey were against -- I 
mean, it -- it was absolutely
 insane, what they did. Ab
solutely. I mean, these were 
all officers which were in 
Russia
 and fought with the Russi
ans. And they were not 
communists, they said. Now, not all were, 
but I mean they -- it -- it was a terrib le 
time for us. A terrible time. My -- my husband
 was at that time already sick. So they 
were, wh-what are we going to  do with him,
 you know. They  di
dn™t expect him to 
stay alive as long as he did, you know, th
ey  didn™t. So  that was one of the reasons 
they didn™t do anything for him.

Q: How did your life change, aside from your husband being sick, but wh en the 
communists came, how did that change
 your life, yours and your husbands? 
A: It-It changed a lot. My 
husband had to leave the army
, because he also was sick, 
you know, a lot. Then he had a very big 
problem getting a job. And finally he got a 
job. But you see, when he was -- when he
 got the job, he was not a communist, you 
know, because a lot of them 
were in the, you know, a lo t of them were really, you 
know, communist wi -- and he was not. And 
there were others who were killed who 
also were not, you know, communists. They
 were not really -- really communists. 
And they  took him there and he had -- they

- some of them -- my late husband was a me
dical student before he went to the war. 
And one of the docto rs was a friend of his,
 they went to same medical school. And 
he came over and they were tr
ying to -- when I had coffee, 
Babi
 would make coffee, 
or si -- mo ther, you know. And he would say do -- don™t you want to break the cup? 
He says, we™ll have some noise. I didn™t wa
nt to do nothing. I di
dn™t talk to them, 
nothing. They came, th ey left. 
And then one day -- and I didn
™t take care of the kids, 
Babi
 took care of the kids. Never asked ab
out the kids. And one day I -- every day 
around five o™clock I used to go for the wa
lk, for a long walk, af
ter my late husband 
died. And 
Babi
 always went with me. One day when
 I went to the door to go, she 
said, I™m n o t going with y
ou. And if you go 
yourself, she says, I™m going put the 
children in a -- in a home for -- you kn
ow, without the -- fo
r children without 
parents. I hesitated just a second, and I le
ft. Wa -- when I walked, I said to my self, 
she™s not my mother. She is 
a stra nge woman. She doesn™t 
care for my children. She 
will put my children in a home 
[indecipherable]
 from home, because she doesn™t 
care. And I went home, I didn™t say anythi
ng to her and I went into my daughter™s. 
My son was only five at the time. And she 
cried and I cried, and it really, you know, 
broke everything between me and my  ch ildre
n. My  son was really too -- too young 
for it. And then the doctor came an d 
he talked to me. I didn™t talk to 
Babi
 at all, I -- 
I just didn™t pay attention to  her. And he ca
me and he told me that if it wasn™t for

Babi
, that time when I walked 
out by my self, they were all around me, they didn™t 
know wh at I™ll do, and they we
re ready to put me away in 
Freiwa ldau
, you know, 
where I told you we were? And 
Ba bi
 said no, let me do it one more time. And she 
had called and she said that I went to 
Elise
 and ev erything is all right between my  
daughter and me. But otherwise I -- I just
 wasn™t, you know, anything. And when  I 
heard that, I went to 
Ba bi
 and I apologized. You know, it was so bad wh a -- what I 
did to her. And then  I went
 to work, and -- and then 
came the time when I -- I 
immediately applied to go to th e 
United Sta tes
 and I was told immediately that I 
will not go, that they will not let me go. 
That the children from 
a Czech officer will 
not be beggars on 
Broadway. 
I didn™t understand wh at that meant, but it was 
something it meant. And then -- then wa 
-- one t -- when I got the refusal that I™m 
not going to  go, I went back one time. I as
ked again. And the guy
 there said, I told 

you, you™re not going to  go. He says, wh
at do you do -- lose, a man? He says, you 
don™t look so bad, you can get 
a man. And I got so mad. I got so mad, and I said, if 
it wasn™t for my husband, you wouldn™t be 
sitting here, and how da
re you talk to me 
like that? And I said, and I am going to the 
president. And I was with my little boy, 
he didn™t go to school yet, and I went to 
the president. When I 
came there, there was 
the soldiers and they put the 
bayonet, they didn™t talk to me. And I said to my  son, I 
said, you stay right here. I said
, if one hair is going to  be 
crooked on this kid, I says,

I cut both your heads off. And I went betw
een the guns and I went in. They didn™t 
do nothing. I -- I made one step -- I went in
 and th ere was another guy. He says, can 
I help you? I said yes, I want to speak to
 the president. He says, do you have an  
appointment? I said, I thought
 the president is for the people, and I am a people and 
I wanted to talk to him. I have a grievanc
e and I would like to tell him. He said okay 
and he took me in, and when  I walked in
, the president walked
 out. I said, he™s 
leaving. I was all excited. I saw him a
nd he™s leaving. And 
th e lady says, don™t 
worry, he™s here. He -- she says, you ju st 
come in and we™ll talk. And I comp lained 
to her and all and she says, do you need 
mo re money? Because I had a pension and 
my children had a pension because we had 
military, you know. And I said no, I have 
money en ough, I -- what could I have bought? There was nothing left to buy 

anyway. I said, I just wanted
 to see my mother, I says, I h aven™t see her. We went 
through the war and now I™m not going to 
see her any more if I don™t go now. Sh e 
says, I can™t promise you to  get -- go to  the 
United Sta tes
, but I can give you some 
more money. And I left and I never, ever 
a-asked again to go until it was three years 
later I got the letter that if I want to go 
I have to give up my  
pension and everything, 
and I can go. You know, it was so unfair to
 take the pension away  from me, but I 
had to -- I had to sign aw ay my  pension, 
my -- everything I had, and I could -- I 

could go. And th en when we 
-- before I went I had to 
go to court to sign for the

children. And when  I was ready to sign, 
a wo man got up and she says she has a 
grievance. She says, how can I sign aw ay th
e things for the children? I got up and I 
had with me one of th e officers who -- who 
was a lawyer and he said, shut up and sit 
down. I said, who is that woman? How dare
 she tell me I can™t sign for the children? 
Where was she all this 
time? Did she go with 
Mike
 to the hospital -- you know, my  
son wa-w as sick, you know. And an yway, th
at was -- wh-which I didn™t know, but 
my  kids had s -- whatever they took out, 
she was the guardian fo
r my children. So 
anyway I signed and -- and we left. But it 
was -- it was a terrible thing, terrible.  
Q: I have a few questions about wh at you just said. 
A: Yeah? 
Q: You said you went to wo

for -- for books for

whatever. And for poetry and 
all that. So I took it. My daughter was an
 ardent reader, so 
the children™s books I 
have had all color. Then  I had a friend, she 
was a lawyer, she gave me all that. A nd I 
made it except poetry I wasn™t very good,

A: Be allowed to be beggars on --
 
on
 Broadway,
 I never forget that. 
Q: Were they saying that you co uld go
 without them, or were they stop -- 

A: Yeah, oh yeah, they said 
it clear. They said it clearly. If I want to go, she said, I 
can, but she can™t let the children go. I sa
id forget it. I™m not going anywhere 
without my children. And then  I was scar
ed for a long time,
 you know, until I got 
this letter and I went there -- my  sister, 
you know, arranged that. My sister and my  
mother, when -- when

my mother wrote him a letter and st -- they
 asked I should let go -- I should be let 
go. And he wrote and that™s
 how I let -- was let go. Bu

didn™t tell me that. She didn™t tell me over the phone th at. I called her. 
Q: Which her did you call? 

A: My sister. I called my sister. I mean
, you don™t call awa -- i-it w as extremely 
expensive, but I was -- once I got the permis

when  my  late husband died I wanted to get 
rid of her, but I couldn™t. She said she is 
not going to  leave me. She is not going to
 leave me, and she stayed, and I had 
problems because of her. Because she would 
call to -- to -- I -- I -- she would call to 
the office and say, you kn

under the communists. I -- I -- I even

United 
States

d my  mouth to speak. My brother-in-
law, he shook me, he says, don™t worry, no
 communists came with you, you can talk 
here. I says, there is nothing what I can 
talk about. He says, you -- are you going 
talk to me or aren™t you? I was so scared
. I was so scared you 
can™t even imagine, 
because you know, there was -- th ere -- ther

put away in -- in a jail and they took her 
kids. I don™t know wh at she did, but oh, I

really th-the -- the thing. Wh en -- when I came, my sister 
just moved in in her first 
house. My sister was here when I came 
here. She is here, I don™t remember how 
many years longer than me. I think five
, six, whatever. You know, they both 
work ed, and they finally got 
themselves a house. But I couldn™t get the house, yi -- I 
couldn™t get no-nothing, I didn™t have any mo
ney. So I stayed wi
th my sister for a 
year and it was really hard because the ho
use was very nice. My sister, my brother-
in-law, they would have lied down , you could have walk ed on th em. But they -- it 
was only a three room house. So sh e had to 
put two of her kids 
together and put two 
in -- my kids there. Then 
I slept in the living room. A
nd it wasn™t very comfy, you 
know, what you call. But she didn™t want me to
 leave. In a -- in a year I left, I got an 
apartment. 
Q: Besides having all the men greet you -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- what other impressions did 
you get when you first arrived? 
A: That was one -- one big thing. Then , of
 course, I saw my mother and my sister 
and my  friend came, the one I knew . He br
ought me the biggest candy box I™ve ever 
seen. It was like half the -- I -- I™ve never seen anything like it. That was -- and then 
the ben -- th e newspaper came . My mo ther
 got a -- a letter from a rabbi that he 
would marry me, with my children. I think th
at was fantastic. I didn™t go to him, but

he wanted to marry me, but I didn't -- I 
didn™t take him up on 
it. My brother-in-law 
said I can™t because he™ll never be a rabbi 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: When  ex actly did you arrive in the 
United States
? 
A: I arrived on -- 1960 on -- on April 11
th

mother came to see me. My 
mother was remarried too, 
my  mo th er was 4 9  wh en  my  
father passed away. And I -- I -- I was so sh
ocked. Sh e came to see me, she took me 
to my sister s and my sister was the re and 
everybody was there. 
And  th en  my  mo th er 
left because my mother left with her husba
nd to a place, because she didn™t make no 
-- no holiday s, you know. So th
ey left for their place. An
d I was so shocked th at she 
left when I came. But she had it arranged befo rehand. 
Q: Did she marry an Ameri
can or another survivor? 
A: American. An American, he was the owner of
 Hanes
 stocking. I had a lot of 
stockings, yeah. He -- he actually sent -- 
sent for me, you know, when we -- when I 
came, he was the one who sent the money, 
because my  sister didn™t have any money 
and my  mother didn™t have any money, so was Mr. 
Brand. 
Q: How were you able to support yourself

A: The first job I really had which worked 
for me was as a technician. But that was 
about -- about -- you see, I was su pposed to 
go two years to school, I went one year 
and I made it, you know, I -- I really took 
everything double and -- and so  and I -- I 
really went out fo r it. I had a job right away
, I was -- I took a job as a baby nurse. I -
- I had no problems taking that test, except
 when they said, a 
baby you -- wh en a 
baby cries, what do you do? I said, 
you know, you check it and it™s -- and 
everything™s all right, if it™s not wet or it™
s not hel -- health-wise alright, then  you 
just, you know, let it cry until it goes to sl
eep. They said that
™s not like that, you 
walk it around on your shoulde
r, it™s a shoulder baby. I didn
™t know wh at a shoulder 
baby is. So that part what I -- I made it 
anyway, I answered all -- all their questions 
and I -- and I had the -- I got a job as a -- 
as a nurse. And I woul
d go for a week and 
be home or whatever, and th

And I did that until I -- until 
I became a technician.  
Q: Did you live with the fa
mily that you cared for? 
A: Oh yeah. That was the bad part, you kno
w. Then -- then I had -- I -- I usually was

touch with them. And the boy I 
had is here, he™s a lawyer, 
Howard . 
I -- I went there 
and I was there nine months. I was already in school, and wh en I finished school I

A: The 
Bar Mitzvah
, my nephew was just 
Bar Mitzvah
 in January and we came 
here in Ap ril. And he had to, of course, gi
ve up his room and be with his brother and 

my  children had the other room. And then  wh
en they went to sc
hool they went to 
the same -- same grade. And my  son also, yo
u know, he went to the first grade. First 
or second, I don™t remember what he went. 
I think he went to th
e second grade. He 
was a -- he was coming in the sec -- he went
 to the second grade. And you know, he 

-- my nephew, the oldest -- wh-when they we nt to school -- I have to ge -- start -- 
when they went to school I wanted to 
give my  daughter money, you know, fo r 
lunch. And my  brother-in-law said absolu tely
 not, that™s my -- my job. And he gave 

 
Interview with Erika Eckstut

52
each one 50 cents or whatev
er. And when they came to
 the bus my nephew would 
say to my  daughter, you give me some mone
y, that™s my  money. And she never said 
that to me tha-that -- I her -- heard that
 many, many years later, that she never had 
lunch, you know, because he wou -- he woul
d take her money, y
ou know, I mean he 
-- he -- it -- it was understandable. My son was -- also had problems because he -- 
he™s a year older than  the other kids and 
I said, don™t you dare 
touch him, you know, 
don™t -- don™t do anything. And my  daughter 
cr -- told me once, she says, you better 
tell him that he can touch him, because he
 is really and trul
y taking adva
ntage of 
him and you told him don™t to
uch, and he doesn™t. So I 
took care of that situation 
too. And then my  brother-in-law, he a -- 
what happened was with our crates what 
we took with  us, one crate was broken or -- 
or wasn™t there and tha-that was the toys 
from my  son. And he had a train and what
ev er, and it was all gone. So my  brother-

in-law said all the toys shou
ld be for the little -- little kid.
 And his older brother said 
to him, don™t you dare touch anything, that
™s all ours, not yours. So I didn™t know 
about that either, of course
. So then  one day my  daugh
ter says, why don™t you ask 
Mike
 what he™s doing when  he comes home 
from school. So I asked him, I said, 
what are you doing when you -- he says, 
I do my  homework. I says, and afterward? 
He says, I do my homework. I said, don™t yo
u go outside and play ? He said, I have 
nothing left to play with, I 
have no toys. So  anyway , so 
I took my neph
ew aside one 

 
Interview with Erika Eckstut

53
time and I told him, I said, 
look, I know it™s not easy for you and it™s not easy for us. 
I says, your parents, I don™t know if they™re
 not aware of it or whatever happened. I 
said, but one thing I can tell you. Don™t do 
that to my children. 
I said, don™t do that, 
because you™ll be sorry. I™ll b
eat the living daylights out 
of you if you ever do it 
again. It took me years before I got him out 
of his -- oh, he was really scared of me. 
But I would have never done it, but -- but an
yway, and my son also got better. It -- it 
wa -- it was hard for them to adjust, it rea
lly was. They had a completely different 
life, you know, and they  had also a comp letely
 different life. It was just as bad for 
them as for my kids, you kn
ow, they -- they weren't used
 to that, a whole family 
moves in. So anyway, that™s how -- and th
en  we finally got our o-own ap artment 
and that was -- that took care of -- th-tha
t -- we were good -- we had -- we had a 
really nice apartment. It -- it
 was a bachelor™s apartment, but it was nice. My s -- my 

daughter -- I had two jobs, I worked as a 
technician and my  daughter was the one 
who took care of the shopping, you know, 
I mean, in the meantime she was already 
14, and she was already a big girl. I neve r had a babysitter for my children when I 

had my  own apartment, I never. But I had 
an apartment in the 
building where there 
was a porter, you couldn™t get in there. That 
-- that™s all I wanted really. And my -- 
then we got a -- an uncle of -- of mine ga ve me a dog, and oh we were so happy we 

had the dog, but I -- that -- these were apar
tments only for people
 with -- with jobs, 

 
Interview with Erika Eckstut

54
who are -- with 
[indecipherable]
 jobs. So  I had a job, 
I had no problem, but I 
couldn™t have the kids. So I took my  daughte
r, she was almo st as tall as I, you know, 
it was fun, it was no problem. But 
Mikey
 started to cry, he wanted to come home 
too. So  I took him too, and I had the dog t
oo. So -- so one day he came and he said, 
who is that, to my daughter. I said, that™s
 my sister. He says, and who is the little 
boy? I said, my  son. He said, and she™s your
 daughter? I says yes. I says, now I have 
to tell you a secret. He says, you know it do
esn™t go here, he says, but one thing -- 
he was also European , he says, one thing I 
tell you. Your kids behave, they can stay, 
but something has to go, either the kids or
 the dog. So  I let 
the dog go. But he was 
funny, we had -- he was funny. 
Q: When  you came to this country, did 
th e Americans that you met ask you about 
your life under communism? 
A: Yeah, well, they ask me about communism
, but that™s about all. They  were never 

interested if I went through
 a Holocaust, and if I wanted
 to say something -- if I 
wanted -- you know, I didn™t really want to, 
but if I wanted, they 
said they are really 
not interested. 

Q: You came in this -- to this
 country  around the time of the 
Eichmann 
trial.

would like to take you and 
your friend out tonight. I says

Baltimore,

John Hopkins
 and the -- and here also, in 
Wa shington, 
and nobody would 
take me. They couldn™t take
 me, they were right, because I had no life left. I h ad less 
than 25 percent of breathing, and th ere 
was nobody to  take, y
ou know, I -- it really 
wasn™t. My girlfriend, she

had something with -- wi-with 
Rosenberg ,
 whatever happened, it wasn™t all rig h t, 
and he got the grant in 
Mount Vernon
 and he had one floor th ere where he di -- did 
the same th ing they did at 
GW
, and sh e wanted to take me there, and sh e took me 
there. And I ha -- I was in a wheelchair, I 
couldn™t walk or a
nything. And we went 
in, and he didn't want to take
 me, but he did ex amine me 
and he says he can™t take 
me, you know, it™s not even legal and he can
™t do it. So we left, my  husband and I, 
and 
Diane,
 my friend, stayed there. So, it wa
s in August and I was very, very  hot, 
and I knew that I have a few hours to 
live. I wanted to call my children and 
everybody, my sister and you 
know, at least to see them. And I wanted to go home. 
And my husband said, I can™t, you know, 
Diane
 is not here, she doesn™t have a car, 
because she came with us. So 
he got out of the car to go
 and get her and that she 
came out with the doctor and with the whee
lchair, not to take mine and th ey took 
me in. And it took th em three weeks to 
wa -- I didn™t weigh enough, you know, I 
had to weigh at least, I think 98 or 
a hundred  pounds and I weighed like 95. And 
they brought me up two pounds
 I was, I think two -- I s
till didn™t have. And they ga 
-- put me o-on th e study. And I was on the 
study and I was the only one left. There 
was a lady left which came later on, she didn™t have wh at I had, she had melanoma. 
And she survived, but for my
 tho -- who was with me, no
body su rvived. There were 
75 people, I was the onl
y one who made it.

Q: I™m not sure I understand tha -- did 
you participate in a research study? 
A: In a research study, yes. I signed up 
for it, I -- for me it was no problem. I mean, 
nobody else wanted me anyway, I couldn™t 
do anything but the research study, not a 
regular study. I had th -- that™s terrible. 
Wh-What do you call this -- I can™t even 
reme mb er now, can you believe it? I have
 that paper. Two -- two medications they 
gave me, I can™t remember now what it was, but I couldn™t take the one, I had a lot 

of problems with it and he took me off that
 and left me  only on one medication. And 
then one day I said I -- I can™t take this  any more. I became so weak from the one 

medication and I stopped it too. And then I 
-- I made it, u n til now, I have with the 
knees. But -- 
Q: So you -- you™re the only one in
 this research study to survive? 
A: Yes, yes, yeah. Except the other lady 
who had what do you 
call it, the melo n -- 
melanoma. Melanoma, you kno
w, it™s a skin cancer. 
Q: Yeah. 
[tape break] 
A:

 You didn™t expect that. I 
never talk about it, yeah. 
Q: I-I™d like to take you back to some of 
the changes that occurre d in this country. 
Now, you came out of a communist state, so
 I™m very curious to see what thoughts

ts that happened in
 this country. You

were here when the 
United Sta tes
 became involved in  the war in 
Vietna m
. Did that 
-- did that touch your life in any way? Di
d you have any impressions about that?  
A: No, I -- I don™t -- 
Q: What were your thoughts about th
e c -- the Co ld War, the conflicts the 
United 
States
 had with the 
Sov i et Unio n? 
A: I actually was al-all for it because I thou
ght wherever is agai
nst the communist is 
good. You know, I -- I like that.  

Q: So you felt the 
United States
 was justified? 
A: Oh, absolutely. 
Q: What about the Civil Rights movement
? You saw some changes, some social  
changes here. 
A: You know, when  the -- wh
en that occurred, I was ve
ry, very busy, but I did 
follow it and I was happy with what a -- w
ith what occurred. Yo
u know, that they 
got something, you kn
ow, and very good. 
Q: You also saw changes in -- in wome
n™s rights. Ho w did you feel -- you™re 
smiling -- how did you feel
 about those changes? 
A: Good, very good. It was good to get

you know, and -- but I liked it 
very much. I liked that th
ey  should get some rights, 
too.

Q: You were here for the assassin ation of the 
Kennedys
 and some of the other 
political assassinations. 
A: Oh, that was terrible. That was 
the worst time be -- for me in the 
United States
. I 
worked in the hospital. God,
 that was bad. That was very, very bad. That was the 

worst thing, I was so upset about it, you ca
n™t imagine. I -- I r
eally liked President 
Kennedy 
a lot. Was very upset about it. 
Q: Were there any other things that you 
saw happening in this
 country over the 
years that you were here, especially thos
e first years, in the 60™s, was a very 
turbulent time. Sixt -- 

A: Yeah, I was -- was -- it was a turbulent tim
e here, too, you know, and I really and 
truly could not take in ev
erything the way I should ha
ve, because like I told you 
before, I had problems with my  kids, I had problems with jobs, I had problems, and 

I really and truly could not give it as mu ch
 time as I would have liked to. I just 
didn™t have it. I worked like y-you can™t imagine. In my second jo b there I worked, I 
was usually finished by 10 o™
clock and 10:20 because I wo
rked two jobs. That was 
in the even -- at night I 
work ed. And when  I came out, usually I had a bus, but 
sometimes, you know, I had to work til 10:30
 or til 11:00 because you can™t leave a 
b -- a hospital without somebody 
else being in the lab. And one day was s -- sn -- s -
- raining, and I would always call, you know,
 that they should get me a cab. And the

 she says, anything, you 
can™t get anything. Sh e says, but you know you
 can sleep here. I said, I can™t, I have 
two kids alone home. So I says, call the fire
 department or the police. She says, we 
don™t call no fire department and police fo
r somebody to go home
. I said, then I™ll 
call, and I called the police and I told them. 
But I told them that I have the two kids 
home, but didn™t bother them
. It wasn™t like today, I wo
uld have been probably in 
jail if they know I have two 
-- I mean, my  daughter was 14 or 15 already at the time. 
But anyway, I told and the guysaid, you stay right where you are, I™ll be right there. 

And he to ok me home and before I got in th
e build ing he says, I™ll go just before so 
nobody sees you with the po

Q: Did you experience any anti-
Semitism in this country?  

A: Yes, I did. I had an  -- a -- I -- I think 
I -- you know, I ch -- I looked for a job and 
it was all the nuns, and they 
want -- they -- when I filled 
out the papers for the job, 
they had there religions, so I put in He
brew, you know? And -- excu se me, they 
wouldn™t take me. They wouldn™t take me.  

Q: And what kind of instituti
on was it, was it a hospital? 
A: A hospital. They wouldn™t take me. And 
when  I asked why, because my  -- I had 
very good credentials, 
they said, I don™t think you are 
cut out, we are very religious

here and we don™t want no Hebrew s here. So
, I mean, I -- I had -- I had a few times, 
you know, not bad,
 but I had it.  
Q: What is your reaction to the resurgence of
 interest in the Holo
caust? In the last 
decade or so  there™s been a revival of in
terest in the Holocaust. Do you have a 
reaction to that? 
A: I am very much interested
 in it and what I didn™t t-te
ll you actually is my son 
knew also what the Holocaust
 meant for me, and he never told me, but you see, 
when -- when the Holocaust star
ted in ™88 - ™89, that™s when I started to -- to have 
my problems, you know, and I was sick
 til ™63, til the museum was built. 

Q: You™re talking about the Holocaust Museum? 
A: The Holocaust Museum. What I found out
 was that my son gave for bi -- the 
build ing fund. When  I came back I found 
out that he had pl
edged 50,000 and he 
play -- paid it out. And he paid it out for th
e living. You know, I me an he had to  put 
in, I guess, whatever. He 
said it was for me and 
Beatrice
. I couldn™t have done it, 
but he could. I couldn™t have done it. 

Q: Can you tell me about the wo rk 
you do for the Holo caust Museum? 
A: I -- I work once a week, ev
ery week I work at the d
onor™s desk. It™s for donor, 
whoever wants to become a me mber or a do
nor or wh atever. And 
then I work with 
the -- with the speaker™s bureau. I go and I sp
eak. Not now, now I am incapacitated,

but otherwise I go and I speak 
a lot. And otherwise, when
ever they ne
ed somebody, 
you know, at the mu seum, they always call 
me and I speak for -- for the people who 
start to work there, the new people, or -- 
so I speak to them. And wherever, whoever 
asked me, I go. 
Q: You mentioned you™re incapacitated, I -- 
since they can™t see you on the tape -- 

A: Yes. 

Q: -- would you tell me why you™re incapacitated? 
A: Yeah, I had just a new knee, and it™s --

Beginning Tape Three, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of the 
United Sta tes 
Holocaust Memorial Museum 
volunteer collection interview with 
Erika Eckstut.
 This is tape number three, side
 
A
. And I had been  asking you ab out your 
work  at the Holo caust Museum and you 
told me that you do some public speaki
ng. Ho w do you -- how do
 you respond when  
you hear Holocaust deniers? 
A: How do I respond to hol -- Holocaust de
niers, there is really nothing to respond 
to, because there is nothing you can tell th
em. I-It™s ridiculous 
even, in my opinion 
to even talk about deniers, what do you
 mean deniers? Who can deny it? I mean, 
don™t you have enough proof? You know, I 
-- I mean, to me it™s 
-- it™s almost a -- 
yo-you know, I mean i-i -- I -- I don™t di -- 
di -- I don™t talk about it very well. When  
-- when I come across a denier, all he had to
 do is just go and take the papers from 
the Germans. You don™t even have to go 
any further, and you got everything you 
need. I mean, it was so clear. How can anybo
dy be a denier? I can™t -- I -- I -- I have 
nothing left to say for that. 

Q: In your opinion, do you think American 
Jews might ever be in danger from neo-
Nazis or skinheads? 
A: Oh yeah. I -- I believed th
at when I came here and I still do. I hope not, but I do 
believe that they can -- I do believe they can, yes.

Q: Have you gone back  to your 
hometown  since you came to 
America
? 
A: Yes, I have. I have been there twice or 
three times. I -- three times, I think. I went 
in ™97 with my granddaughte
r when I took her when I ju
mped, I told you I -- I took 
her there. And then I went -- before that, 
I went in ™93, when I was so sick and I 
couldn't walk yet, I was in a wheelchair, a
nd my  granddaughter took me because my  
husband was very mu ch against it, my  sist
er was against it, everybody was against it 
except my  oldest granddaughter wasn™t against it. If
 Omi
 wants to go, she says, then 
I™ll take her. And she took me, and we we
nt together. We were there one week, but 
we were there. I didn™t go anywhere. I rea
lly couldn™t very well ma nage to go, but I 
was back, and it -- it did me very good to
 go back. And then I went again because 
they had a -- I -- I didn™t go after until ™64 or
 ™65, they had a -- all th e officers, you 
know, who were in the army
, whoever got something, y
ou know, my  late husband 
got four medals. So we were there and th
ey  gave us the medals. My brother-in-law 
got two medals, my -- in -- in retrospect, 
or wa -- and the -- there -- there were, from 
all over the world they were there, from
 Australia, 
from whoever. Whoever was in 
the army came, and we were all th ere. Then
 we went one more time -- no, was three 
times I went, was three times I was in 
Czechoslovakia
. In ™63, in ™
64 and in  ™67. 
Q: ™63? 
A: I mean, no, na -- ™93. I™m sorry.

times, I was there last year. 
Q: And what was that experience like? 
A: Oh, th at was a excellent experience, I loved going to  
Israel. 
I love 
Israel
. I -- i-i-
if -- if it would have been diffe
rently, I would have gone to 
Israel. 
Q: Have you ever re
gretted not going to 
Israel
? 
A: No, I haven™t regretted, 
I mean it -- it -- it™s no -- no
 use even s-spending time on 
regretting, you know. But 
I would have gone to 
Israel
. I like to go there. If -- if I am 
all right this year, we ha -- I have there a 
cousin. And he was just now in a -- he was 
actually in the ﬁ
Timeﬂ 
magazine. He -- he is not in the army, but you know, 
whoever is in the army is being called. He 
is 25, or 26 years old, and he went to 
somewhere and they -- they a
ttacked him i-in na -- just
 now, it was about two weeks 
ago. And he -- there were two officers
 and I don™t know ho
w many, you know, 
soldiers were with them. 
And the one officer was kille
d. And he w-was wounded 
and still with the one hand he killed anothe
r Arab, or two Ar-Arabs, whatever, and 
he got out of it. But he had 15 little shra
pnels, but they couldn™
t take them all out, 
you know, because it would ha
ve been dangerous th-the 
way they are. And he is 
supposed to get married in August. If I c
ould have my  two knees
 done, I would have

72
gone too, if I could. It all depends, beca
use this knee is still swollen. But if I could 
have both done, I would go. 
Q: How has your Holocaust experience in
fluenced the choices that you™ve made 
over the years? 

A: You mean wha -- how a -- ha
d the Holocaust, as such -- 
Q: Your experiences at -- how -- how did 
-- how do you feel that your experien ces 
made an impact on some of the decisions 
that you made, some of the choices that 
you made over the years? 

A: I really couldn™t tell you, I -- I don™t 
know. I guess my whole life, you know, is 
involved with the Ho
locaust. My whole life is the Ho
locaust. You know, I mean it™s 
-- it™s in there, you can™t get rid of it ever. You know, I am a product of the 

Holocaust. So maybe whatever 
I did had to do with whatever
 I went through, I don™t 
know. I really couldn™t answer 
you that question very well. 
Q: Did your view of Juda
ism change after the war? 
A: I don™t think it really 
changed. You know, m-maybe 
a little bit, but not really 
much. I don™t think it change
d mu ch, maybe a little bit. 
Q: When  you lo ok back upon yourself as
 a parent, do you th ink the Holocaust had 
any influence on the way you raised your ch ildren?

73
A: I was asking that my self, and I really
 can™t give you an answer. I -- I hope I 
didn™t -- I -- I tried not to do it to my ch
ildren. I really did try very -- I -- I was 
thinking about it, because don™t forget, I wa
s very early, mother
 and father to my 
children. And ev en when my  husband was al
ive, I was also always there for them. 
And I was very, very worried
 I shouldn™t make the wro
ng decision because of. And 
I hope I didn™t, but I really couldn™t, with 
a good conscience say I -- I did or I didn™t. 
I don™t know.  
Q: Do you think y
ou would have done 
anything differently? 
A: I don™t really think so. I don™t know. 
I don™t know how my  life would have been 
if I didn™t go through it. I -- it would have
 been a completely different life if we 
didn™t have to go th rough it. 
Q: You mentioned also that
 you have grandchildren. 
A: Yes. 

Q: Do you talk to your gr
andchildren mu ch ab out your experiences? Cause you said

Q: What has been your best surprise about life in 
America
? 
A: The freedom. Freedom I didn™t have. There was no freedom under the 

communists at all. I -- I -- I wish I -- I wish
 I had written, I was alw ays so afraid that 
if I write, and so mebody sh -should come on
e day, if something could happen. And 

then when I was here, I had no more time. 
And then as time went by, you don™t feel 
it so strongly, so you don™t, but I should 
have written about it. It was so bad, you 
can™t even imagine. It rea lly was worse than anything 
you can ever imagine. After 
the Holo caust. It was a bad time, a very bad time. 

 
Interview with Erika Eckstut

76
Q: Can you give me some examples? 
A: Examples, examples was that you didn™t 
have any -- any freedom at all. You had 
to go and clean the streets. You had to go
 and do whatev er they wanted you to  -- to 
do. I mean, it was -- a-and you were never su
re that the person you really knew, that 
he is a person you didn™t -- 
you do know. He could have 
gone and say that you are a 
spy, or whatever i-it -- it was his -- his 
thing he would have said. It -- it was a 
terrible time. Really not a good time. 
Q: What has been your bi
ggest disappointment in 
America
? 
A: You know wh at was the biggest disappointment for me in 
America? 
Is divorces. 
Because my daughter and my son they bo
th divorced. And th
at was my biggest 
disappointment, how many divorces are here
. That™s my  biggest disappointment. 
Q: How has September 11
th
 of th is past year impacted you personally? 
A: I -- I was extremely  upset about that. No
w, this was something which really and 
truly was -- that was the biggest disappointment actually of 
America
, that -- 
because you see, when 
America
 was attacked first, and nothing was done, I was 
very disappointed wh en the Marines were 
shot. 280 or how many did they shot that 
time? Who-Who -- who is the other things
 wh ich happen ed? Nobody did anything. 
But you see, when I talked ab out it, you know, like my  husband, he™s not -- he™s not 

a survivor. He couldn™t understand that I 
can™t understand th at it doesn™t add up fo r 

 
Interview with Erika Eckstut

77
the Americans, because in 
America
 nothing can happen. That 
is when you ask me if 
the Jews from -- can be att
acked, sure they can. If you 
let it happen, it will. Because 
you are practically very sure of yourse
lf, and you can never be sure, never. It 
doesn ™t work that way, unfortunately. And th
a-that was a terrible th ing, I can™t even 
tal -- wha-what can I tell you? I was very, ve
ry -- I am still very disappointed. I am 
still very worried, you know, I 
don™t know who is good and 
who is bad. It™s -- it™s 
really some thing wh ich should have ne
ver happened. That 
should have never 
happened here, never. And now with this 
war, th-this guy, you know who was -- the 
American who was there, 
och
, it™s -- it is just too mu
ch. It™s just too much. 
Q: Is there anything about the American
 reaction to th e events of September 11
th
 
that has either upset you or -- or gi
ven you hope ab out this country? 
A: You know, you always like to look fo
r hope, you know. Yo
u never look y-y-you 
know, with the bad, you always try to l
ook for the good. And I think, you know, 
what it gave me is a lo t of confidence
 the way the Americans behave, you know. 
And I hope that it really w -- is work -- wo
rth it, you know, that -- that™s all I can 
say, I -- I h ope that it™s really meant th
e way it™s said. I mean, you see the flags 
outside, it™s not just for show, but th ey r eally mean it, you know. I -- I have noth ing 
else I can say about it, I --

A: I don™t think -- I don™t think I want to
 acco mp lish anything. I think whatev er I 
could, I accomplished. I have really and truly beautiful ch
ildren, they are very, very 
nice. I don™t like the idea that they both got 
divorced, that wasn™t in my book. I -- I -
- it™s -- it™s something I can™t understand ve
ry well, but they are otherwise beautiful 
children and they both remarr
ied and now everything -- but
 that™s something which, 
you know, bothers me a little. But just 
-- just -- i-it should be peace in 
America
, it 
should never happen anything again, and I 
should be ab le to have both my  knees 
working because they -- 
they don™t work for the last f
our or five years, and I -- I -- 
I™ll just be happy. I -- I don™t think I 
want to accomp lish anything any mo re. 
Q: I have a few questions to -- to go back -- 
A: Okay . 
Q: -- and clarify things that you said on your 
Shoah 
Foundation interview, that I 
would like to get some -- 

A: Okay . 
Q: -- some details on. Have you had any 
difficulties getting reparations, either under 
communism or in the 
United States
? 
A: Under communism didn™t exist anything,
 I couldn™t have gotten anything. When  
I came here I got a letter from 
Germany
 that they were lookin
g for my in-laws, for 
my -- for the 
Kauders
. And I didn™t have money to go 
or do anything, so I didn™t do

anything. My mo ther had gotten, which 
-- without her doing anything, she had 
gotten a -- a -- a flat sum fo
r whatever, I don™t know. And sh e also got, which she 
said she got for me, was 3,000 dollars, and th
at was all. I never applied -- no, that™s 
not true. I applied last year or wh enever
 we got that letter 
from the -- from the 
lawyer. You know, from the lawyer here, 
Mark
, or whatever. I never heard from 
him. And that was all. I never got anything
 but the 3,000 dollars my mother gave me 
when I came. If it was for me or was her 
money, I don™t know, but she gave me the 
3,000 dollars. That™s all I had from reparatio ns. 
Q: You also mention in  your in
terview, the -- the ship, the 
Patria
. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Can you tell me a little bit about the 
ship and where this
 historical event 
intersected with your family. 
A: That happened in  
Czernowitz
, and I only know that
 the ship went to 
America
. I 
know that all boys went, no girls, and they
 wanted my  father, who was very, very 
active in it, he was a big Zionist and he wa
s very active and they  wanted to take one 
of his children, the older one. Sh -She shou
ld go because he -- he did a lot of work 
and he didn™t really have 
any children. Bu t he didn't wa
nt it because it wasn™t fair. 
You know, there were no girls, they were a
ll boys. That™s all I know about. I don™t

know anything else. Of course later on I 
found out, God knows when , that it never 
made it. That it -- 
Q: Do you remember what year
 all this was taking place? 
A: No. Must have been in ™41 - ™42 wh
en we were in -- when we were in 
Romania
. 
Q: What would you like your family or y
our friends or whoever will listen to this 
tape to know about you that they ma
y not already know 
about you and your 
experiences? 
A: That™s a very good questio
n, what would I like them to know? Well, I would like 
to leave for everybody who ev
er reads anything or anything I ever said, or read, or 
wha-whatever I left behind, that you sh ou
ld never hate. You should always try to 
love instead of hate, no matter what. And th
at I was happy to be here, and I hope it 
takes awhile before I go. And that™s all. 
Q: Is there anything else that you™d lik
e to add befo re we conclude? Is there 

anything that we haven™t discu
ssed that you™d like to bring up? 
A: Yeah, I would like that the 
United States
 should stay safe, nothing sh ould 
happen to them ever again, 
and it should just be a good  world for all of -- of the 
people, all my  children who™ve stayed 
behind. Everybody sh ould be well, and 
everything should be fine.

Q: Okay . 
A: -- I can™t think of a-anything I would 
like to do -- to -- ju
st for me it™s very 
important that I always tell everybody that
 I don™t like to hate, I don™t even -- tha-
that™s very, very important a
nd nothing should happen to  the 
United States
. It 
should be a good world, and people should 
learn to love each other. And that™s what 

I wish for everybody. And to 
my kids, and everybody shou
ld stay well and be good.
