 every language. Wa s a 
very hard school, and I know when we lived in 
America, there was an ar

game s that -- after dinner. So, you know. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And [indecipherable] 

Q: When did you find out that you were adopted? 
A: Now, I tell you honest, when we went back to 
that one town where the 
[indecipherable] I used 
to live when I was adopted, we went to [indeci
pherable] and there were some ti me s people came  
and they said to my mom, is that the girl?  
I didn™t say anything. And I had -- I was probably 
smarter ri -- I had an idea, so I asked her once.
 Oh no, she said, during the war, we had a little 
boy. Kids from Belgium came over a lot. And -- but
 he went home . She di
dn™t -- she didn™t tell 
me  at that time , I was too young. I -- I knew it. And then I asked my girlfriend™s mother when I 
was about 10, and she says, no, not that I know. 
I don™t know if she knew. But -- and then my 
mother want to tell me  when -- before I was finish high school, because  my diploma had to go 

my real name. But in Holland [indecipherable] th
e time, you could not adopt all the wa y that you 
got the name . Not -- after the war it changed, of
 course. But they could not do that then.

Q: So, did you ca -- 
A: I had original my own name. 

Q: You had Berliner -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- all through school. So we
ren™t you suspicious then? 
A: I didn™t know then, my mother 
went to school, my mother even 
went to my office, where they 
knew it, and I didn™t want to ask [indeci
pherable] call me  by my adopted name . 
Q: I see, so yo -- so there wouldn™t be -- 
but you had a suspicion from a very young age. 
A: Yeah, from [indecipherable] that I was young. 
And she was gonna tell me , she had the hard 

time, she -- don™t tell me, I said, I 
know. And then I told her [indecipherable] some times they say 
[indecipherable] you have a nice round face, lo
oks like the Ge rmans. Then I got all red. 
[indecipherable] why you get so red? Said, I don™t 
know. See, because they were talking about it. 
Yeah, I knew it. I didn™t
 want to tell them. 
Q: Was -- do -- so, was there -- you -- when sh

A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: Wa s she upset in some  ways, do you think? 

A: No. 

Q: No?  

A: I don™t reme mber exactly, but she didn™t 
have to say any more, so it was fine. 
Q: And this didn™t bother you 
that you were adopted, no? 
A: I didn't feel different, you know?

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0516  
16 
 
A: My parent s were sometimes afraid that they 
will to -- take me back when they coul d have 
done it.  
Q: They could have? 

A: Yeah, because I was adopted
 -- like foster parents. 
Q: Right. 

A: Official -- they di dn™
t get paid. I was official
, I had papers at home that they adopted me , but 
it™s not like it is here
 that you get the name. 
Q: Uh-huh. So they were always afraid that your
 biological mother would 
come back and try to 
get you?  

A: Yeah, yeah. And I tell you, if a [indecipherable]
 when I left here, I got a letter from some  
person from Detroit and he wrote me  that he was ma rried -- he knew from my uncle, that he was 

ma rried to my mother. But she never told him th
at she had a kid. He said, if I would have known 
it, I would taken you back. My parents were alwaysafraid for that. I was so glad that he didn™t 
know it. Wa s a nice guy, when my mother inheri
ted a small home  in Cologne, and he said 
because I was the daughter, he gave
 me  three-quarters of that money. 
Q: Really? 

A: And from that mone y we went to 
America. We have to pay for that. 
Q: That™s interesting. 

A: I never contact [indecipherable] 

Q: We re you di -- were you cu
rious about your mother?

here, that is -- and another pict
ure with family. No, but I had my
 parents, and I had nice family. 
Q: Right. 
A: Didn™t bother me . 

Q: It didn™t bother you. 

A: When my mother said once, she saw the name
, my na me , Berliner on the list from people, and 
they lived not far from us, she said, you th
ink that is family of
 yours?  I don™t care. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: I didn™t want to know. If you don™t know -- 
and my mother gave me  away because their 
parents are probably Orthodox, and you know year
s ago -- she was not young, she was already 
30 years old. And she has the boyfriend, but
 he didn™t ma rry her. And so --  
Q: Right. How old were your adop

 they older?  [indecipherable] 
A: When I was adopted in ™22, my mo
ther was born ™86, so she was 36 -- 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- and my father was 35, some thing like that, so -- 

Q: So they weren™t very young. 

A: Not real young, no.

fa mily and his family are sort of close? 
A: No, whe n they me t each other -- they di
d not really visit e

 I came out of that one building and I went to 
the house, they were happy and [indecipherable]
 you know, they™re okay, but they did not visit 
that much, no.

Holland, and wrote each other. And his wife [indeciphe

A: Of course. 

Q: They did.

A: A little bit, mm-hm. Nothing mu ch happened, they bombed Rotterdam, and then they were 

going to bomb Amsterdam, and they didn™t want 
-- that™s why they gave

war. 

Q: They stopped the war 

A: They saved the city.

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0516  
23 
 
A: Yeah, yeah.  
Q: Right. Do you reme mber the Nazis comi ng in and taking over? 

A: No, I didn™t look when they came in, but I kno
w they came  in, and they -- when my boss left 
the office, the city government appoint
ed a lawyer, you know, to look over it. 
Q: Mm. 

A: And after that we got an German guy, he was an
 old soldier, he was hurt, he had one arm, I 
guess, and they put him down there, too. 

Q: So he was running the business? 

A: No, he d -- he held up -- he was good -- he wa
s good to the people. He even told me , he said, 
you want me to be a father, and then he gave 
[indecipherable] and all. Well, my pa rents didn™t 
want that. He  want -- he want to do that. 

Q: He knew that you were Jewish? 

A: Yeah, when I had to leave in
 ™42. I couldn™t work any mor e . 
Q: Right. So -- so let™s talk a 
little bit about what goes on be
tween 1940 and ™42, after the Nazis 
come  in, are you identified as Jewish? 

A: We  had to get I.D.™s. I have one with me . And 
my parents had an J on it, and I didn™t have to 
because I only knew two Jewish grandparents, an
d according to Hitler, you was not Jewish, and I 
was some pl ace when we were picked up, and the me n didn™t know anything about Jewish 

[indecipherable] father was Jewish. And he re
ally was not Jewish according to the Je wish 

religion, you are what your mother is. And he wa
s picked up and sent away and so I didn't have 
to have a J. I didn™t want to 
be without my parents. So I took it and you could -- you couldn™t go 
out after eight o™clock, nobody could go out any 
more. And the Jews only could shop between 
three and five, things like that. Bu
t nothing really happened til ™42. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0516  
24 
 
Q: There were -- there were a lot of re
strictions, right, for those two years. 
A: Yeah, but not til ™42, then 
they start picking up people. 
Q: Right.  
A: You know, ma rketplaces and stoop -- 

Q: But do you -- do you reme mber there were gove
rnme nt workers who were fired because they 
were Jewish. Do you reme mber that?   

A: No, I don™t know, we -- where we lived it was not
 really a governme nt town, was more in the 
capital at The Hague, and all. 

Q: I see. 

A: But I™m sure they were. I was even 
in the pr ivate place, I couldn™t work.  
Q: By ™42? 

A: The Jews couldn™t work any more. 

Q: Right. 
A: Mm-h m.  
Q: But you can™t -- you can™t have a te
lephone, you can™t have radios.  
A: We  didn™t have telephones. 

Q: You didn™t have a telephone anyway. 

A: No, only with aunt who was rich, y
eah. And radios, no. They -- you could not do 
[indecipherable]. We  had the radio -- see, we 
had the radio what you c
ould rent and pay every 
month, four stations or some thing. And then they
 brought an regular one, 
a nice one. Well, that 
we could not keep, you know. We  have to turn that in. 

Q: You had to turn that in? 

A: Yeah. Not everybody di
d that but we did. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0516  
25 
 
Q: Right. So the rest
rictions are out -- 
A: Oh yeah. 
Q: -- they™re --  

A: For everybody. 

Q: -- it™s like a pain in the neck, right? 

A: Yeah, but it was for other people too, they co
uldn™t listen to radio from
 England, and I always 
listen to radio from England. And that you couldn™t do. 

Q: That you couldn't do -- right.  

A: That™s why they took it from everybody, yeah. 

Q: But that was true for Jews and 
people who were not Jewish as well? 
A: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

Q: Everybody. 

 A: Yeah. 
Q: Right. But ther e were certain rest
rictions that were just for Jews? 
A: Oh yeah, yeah. 
Q: Yes. 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: We ™re -- we™re gonna have to stop the tape now. 

A: Okay.

A: Oh yeah. 
Q: Did it have a J on it? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: It did. Is that you
r choice, to have it? 
A: No. 

Q: No. 

A: Yeah, that was my choice, for me  yeah, cause 
I didn™t have to. Because when I worked in the 
office still, the lawyer we nt through the Germane mbassy and got a paper for me  that they could 

not do anythi ng to me  because I was not supposed to have a J, but they didn't take it off. And I 

always had to carry th

Jewish star because -- 
A: I did.

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0516  
27 
 
A: Yeah, but I didn™t always use it because 
nobody knew I was Jewish, so when they left, you 
know. And J oe and I, we went some times some pl ace. 
Q: But did people know that your parents were Jewish? 

A: Yeah, mm-hm. 

Q: So wouldn™t they then assume that you were Jewish, or not? 

A: No, I don™t know if they thought about. 
Maybe I took it off later. I got -- 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- don™t know exactly. 

Q: Right. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: We re you scared when the Nazis were there, when they took over? 

A: No, no I™m not the scary type, no, no, no. 

Q: You™re not -- you™re not the scary type? 
A: Joe was more than I was.

to take Jews and bring them 
to We sterbork -- well, you had heard about We s t
erbork be fore, because it was started by --

from the big company there, and every day th
ey came home. Til one time , after maybe about 
three, four weeks, they didn™t come  ho
me , and they were sent to We sterbork. 
Q: And they were sent to We sterbork. 

A: And then the next day -- that was Fridays, and on Saturdays they came to pick up the wives 

and the kids. 
Q: And did you know he was in We sterbo
rk, or you didn™t know where he was? 
A: Yeah, we -- oh, we knew that

A: No, I didn™t work any more. We  took some  
work home for sewing. I had to sew -- I worked 
for a compa ny that imported sewing machines t
oo, so I had a nice sewing machine, and we did 
some  work at home, and we 
got paid some  from that. 
Q: But that was difficult, you probably --

should go in hiding? 

A: We ll, yeah, but she -- I had [indecipherable] at

gone already, long time. And they were talking a
nd talking, and she got -- later she told me  she 
was nervous because she was afraid some thing w
ould happen when sh -- they left luckily, and 
then she came out. And we told her, you know?  But -- and she went outside some times too, what 

she shouldn™t have done, but -- 

Q: Did she look Jewish?

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: And was she wearing a Jewish

there he came with a friend. His mother had my 
dog, and you should hear that doggie. Everybody wa

wa s it. But what I did, was a good thing I did get 
the key from the apartment. Found after people

the furniture out. Everything. So I told Joe, sa
id, what are we gonna do?
 And he said, you know, 
I told my other neighbor, he was Jewish, his wife
 was not, so he -- he ha

on the fourth floor, but he slept 
in veranda [indecipherable] porch

they did, they took all the nice furniture, put that
 down with the cable, I 
don™t know how they did 
it, and up to that guy™s house. He helped us. S

Germany. And he went there to the labor, there™
s a labor office where you go, and I went with 
him, and he said -- he went there, and they ha

put it in the register that you 
are ma rried. I don™t know if he did that

A: Yeah. And he was on top of that -- we had a 
lot of dykes, and he was driving then, he didn™t

Q: Wo w. 

A: That was almost the end of the war.

-- 

A: No, nobody re -- I -- 

Q: Nobody. 

A: -- I saw people that I knew and they didn™t 
even look at you because you could not trust 
anybody at that time .  

Q: What is that like not to
 be able to trust anybody? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0516  
41 
 
A: Yeah. 
Q: It™s awful. 

A: It™s bad, yeah.  

Q: Did you learn that very ear

Nazis came in? 
A: If I what? 

Q: Did you learn that very soon after 
the Nazis came  in that you can™t -- 
A: Oh yeah, sure. Oh yeah, yeah, you know that from people, yeah. And I know there was some  

guys and I think was a brother from Joe™s mother
, and nobody had contact with him, and he was 
-- you could not trust him, I know. He went to 
people™s house and threatened them, and took 
things from them, yeah. 

Q: Really? 

A: Yeah. [indecipherable]. Once he tried, but he had no luck. 

Q: And did Joe do some  resistance work as well -- 
A: No, h -- 
Q: -- as trying to get you food? 

A: What he did, that was still when he was 
working. He took I.D.s from people that worked 
there, and hid them some place and gave 
them to other people, Jewish people. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: I know different people he gave them to, mm- hm. 

Q: Did you work for the resistance at all, or -- 

A: No, I could not --

A: -- no. You could not do that. It di -- 
if they caught you for that, you know -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0516  
42 
 
Q: Then you were finished. 
A: [indecipherable] 

Q: Right. 

A: No, we had enough to do with
 the food and all, and -- 
Q: It must have been difficult just tr
ying to survive in those circumstances. 
A: Yeah. And you had no coals,
 you had nothing, no heat.  
Q: So it was c -- 

A: So he -- so he went to the park and cut some  trees. 

Q: He cut so -- 

A: That was not nec -- was not allowe d, yeah. And cu
t the root and put it in there, so we  had that. 
We could not complain. And a lot of people got food from [indecipherable], you know, and it 

was so bad, and we got it, but we gave itto somebody. We  didn™t want to eat that.  

Q: And whe r e did you -- where did he put the wo

apartment, or what? 

A: Oh yeah, we had an old stove, with the pipe. 

Q: Uh-huh.

second daughter wa s born we still had that. 
Q: You were in that  apar tment? 

A: No, I lived some place else, but we
 still had that [indecipherable] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0516  
43 
 
Q: That same -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: That same stove? 

A: Yeah. But then we had co
als, of course, yeah, mm-hm. 
Q: Right, right, right. The winter of 1944 was 
a terrible winter in -- 
in Holland, wasn™t it? 
A: Mm-hm, yeah. 

Q: For everybody. Do you reme mber that time? 

A: Yeah, it was bad, mm-hm. Yeah. 

Q: How bad  was it? 

A: We ll, snow and ice. But otherwise, I don™
t know. It was really
 cold, I know that. 
Q: And was food hard to get? 

A: Oh, there was no food in the stores, or so, no, no. 

Q: So there was no food. 
A: No, what you got some ti me s wa s people got an ra
te -- rated -- fa -- rate 
-- an ration card. Here 
-- they got it here too, I guess. 
Q: Mm. 

A: And then you could get some  food. And he got
 one for me too, some place. So -- well there 
was not muc h food anyway, but -- and then, before
 the war was over, I think, on America, they 

sent on the Red Cross, they sent food over. A
nd then everybody who had a ration card, you could 
get some. 

Q: Did you lose a lot of weight? 

A: No. 

Q: You didn™t? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0516  
44 
 
A: I stayed always the same. 
Q: You stayed the same . 

A: Yeah, yeah. I was not a big eater, and I bake
d bread and Joe got some  potatoes and stuff, you 
know. And s o me times we bought -- w-we ha
d some friends, we bought some meat. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: If it was real meat or dog meat, I don™t know. 

Q: Did you ever get sick? 

A: No, I was very lucky. 

Q: No?  You didn't get sick -- 

A: Joe in the end, cause of his nerves, he had a 
little breakdown. When I 
went outside to see the 
soldiers come in -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- and he could not, mm- hm. 
Q: And wha t  was that like when you saw the soldiers come  in, when that was the liberation -- 
A: Pretty good. 

Q: -- it was pretty good, huh? 

A: Yeah, great. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Yeah. That™s what I say, people should not
 forget that, what the Americans did. 
Q: Uh-huh.  

A: Yeah. 

Q: Did you -- when the war was over did you try 
to look for your parent
s?  Did you think that 
ma ybe they were alive, or did you think that they were gone? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0516  
45 
 
A: No, we heard then what ha ppened and all, yeah. Mm-hm.  
Q: So it was clear. 

A: Yeah. I couldn™t fi
nd anything, no. Mm-hm. 
Q: And was there anybody from that fa mily who was alive? 

A: Oh, an s-second cousin came by, and that was -- 
and I had one second cous
in girl that she -- 
she was in hiding too, and she worked in a nursi
ng home , and we went there some time s and she 
came over my house to meet her boyfriend who wa
s in hiding too. And she was -- yeah, she was 
the -- really the only one. And th
en my mother™s sister, who wa
s rich, she came out of hiding 
with her husband, and so I had her. That was the only family we had. 

Q: So it was a very difficult time then -- 

A: Oh yeah. 

Q: -- when liberation came --  

A: Yeah. 
Q: -- cause  in the end -- 
A: Mm-h m.  

Q: -- you can™t go back to -- to what you were.  

A: Oh no. Mm-hm. And Joe couldn™
t find a job of nothing. So what 
he did -- my father had the 
textile license and he took that and he bought tex
tile and he st -- was standing on the ma rket with 
textile, to make some  money. We ll, you 
only could buy it on ration cards, you know? 

[indecipherable] by points. Like 
a handkerchief would be five 
points and a towel would be 10 
points, some thing like that, you know? 

Q: So, to be th-these textiles he had to -- 

A: Yeah, oh yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0516  
46 
 
Q: -- use the ration cards? 
A: Yeah. It was not easy 
after the war, mm-hm. 
Q: Wa s there a lot of dest
ruction in Holland, or not? 
A: No, not in Amsterdam, really. 

Q: Not in Amsterda m.  

A: No. Rotterdam was bad. 

Q: And -- and you stayed in Amsterdam?  

A: Yeah, mm-hm. 

Q: How long did it take before it 
started to feel a little
 bit normal, or did it never feel norma l? 
A: Ah, I got my daughter, yeah. 

Q: How soon was your daughter born? 

A: End November, that year after 40 f -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 
A: ™45. 
Q: And whe n did you get ma rried? 

A: ™44. 

Q: ™44. 

A: The first. And then I got the other one about
 three and half years 
later, mm-hm. And we 
moved from that apartment where we lived duri
ng the war, and some body, an uncle fr om Joe 
lived in a nice house, first floor. And was too mu
ch money for him, so we  -- you couldn™t get a 
house of a rent or anything, so we exchanged. That
 you could do. So he went to that apartment, 
we came in his house. That™s where 
I got my second child that time. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0516  
47 
 
A: Mm-h m.  
Q: And did you want to stay in 
the Netherlands, in Amsterdam?  
A: No, didn™t want to.  

Q: You didn™t want to stay? 

A: No. I had nobody an-any more, no. 

Q: And Joe didn™t want to stay either? 

A: No, he couldn™t get along very mu ch with his fa ther. 

Q: He couldn't get along with his father? 

A: No, no, he was not nice. And then we left. And 
I think 17 later -- 17 years later, we went back 
to Holland, and I told him, see your parents and 
he didn™t want to. Says, do it for your mother, 
your mother, she always worked hard and she 
was good. So we went and then he was so happy, 
the fa ther now. 

Q: The father was different. 
A: [indecipherable] appreciate it, you know? 
Q: Right. 

A: We ll, he was nicer when we came there, and he
 brought us some  present. He was nicer to me  

than to the other daughter-in-laws, and they 
are looking at me , he [indecipherable] you know?   
Q: Really? 

A: And he realized that Joe was one of the be
st sons he had. He didn™t know that years ago. 
Q: He didn™t know that earlier. 

A: He didn't know that, yeah. 

Q: How long did you stay in -- in 
the Netherlands 
after the war? 
A: We  left in ™53, October. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0516  
48 
 
Q: Oh, in ™53. 
A: Yeah.  

Q: And was then a difficult time  between 1945 and 1953 for you there? 

A: No [indecipherable] not. No. We
 had friends, Joe played soccer. I ma de a lot of friends there. 
No, we had pretty good. 

Q: So life was -- was not so bad. 

A: But was hard financial. He didn™t ma ke th
at much. And then with the kids and all. 
Q: Right. 

A: And that was hard and that™s when my uncle
 said, you want to come  to America, we said 
okay. And that was in ™50. Took a little ove
r three years before we could come. 
Q: Was it easy for you to be a mother? 

A: Easy?  I was the only child. I 
didn't  know how to put a diaper on, Joe had to do it, and other 
things he did, but otherwise it was okay. 
Q: It was okay? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: We ™re going to have to stop the tape.

Beginning Ta pe Three 
Q: Ruth, when did you find out wh
at had ha -- really happened dur
ing the war, about the death 
camps?  Do you reme mb er? 
A: Now, I heard from pe ople that came  back. I ha
ve the girlfr iend, she lives now in Israel, and I 
still have contact, and she was in concentrati
on camp. She didn™t tell -- one thing she only told 
me , that she had to look at some body -- ever
ybody had to look some body that got hang, you 
know, one of the girls? 

Q: Some body who got hung, yes. 

A: Hung, yes. We ll, first thing she didn™t say an
ything and she is doing fine. And I had an second 
cousin who came over, and he told me  why he™s -- 
was still alive, because th
ey had to stay in line 
and walk, and then they took the fi
rst part to the gas chamber. Next
 time he was in the back of -- 
in the front, and they took the back. He was lu
cky like that. But that™s 
about all I heard. People 
didn™t talk much about it. 
Q: Did you see -- did you see things in the news
paper?  We re there repor
ts in the newspaper? 
A: When?  After war? 
Q: After the war.  

A: No, I don™t remember  that any more. I hear
d from the Ame r ican soldiers that came in, you 

know, what they saw, and I saw that some ti me s one
 television. [indecipherabl
e] we didn™t have a 
television. Was no televisions -- 

Q: Right, right. 

A: -- til after I was here. So then later I find out. And here I find out by the Red Cross, they said 

they could find out when people died, and when they came to my house and she said she 

couldn™t find out everything. And when we we
nt -- that summe r in Holland, we went to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0516  
50 
 
Westerbork, and was in that office, and I told 
him. And he s a id, oh, you want to know?  He said, 
what™s the name ?  He went to the books, and 
picked the book up and he 
showed me  just -- 
Q: Your father™s [indecipherable] 
A: When -- where he was born, when he was born 
and where he died, and my mother too. And I 
told -- I called later the Red Cross and I told
 them, if you get people asking from Hol l and, tell 
them where to get it. 

Q: Right. 

A: They said, oh, thank you. 

Q: Since so ma ny Jews were killed 
from Holland, very few come  back. 
A: Yeah, mm-hm. 

Q: Wa s it a difficult time being Jewish, or did pe
ople not know you were Jewish at the time, after 
the war?  

A: I don™t know, I know people, some  people, I ha
d friends even, that were in hiding, and they 
were usually very -- people that were Chri
stians, you know, religious, and they didn™t do 
anything. They didn™t even ta
lk about it any more that 
they were Jewish. Yeah. 
Q: They were ha -- they were hi
ding it, that they
 were Jewish? 
A: Yeah. And it™s -- I kn
ew some body had the signs from concen
tra -- she had that taken off, you 
know. But -- 

Q: So what did you think about that? 

A: I wouldn™t do things like that
, but -- because I thought [indeciphe
rable] well, that way it won™t 
happen again in Holland, you know. Other countri
es will not help -- 
help us, but you know, 
that™s their business.  

Q: You think there was anti-Semitism in Holland? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0516  
51 
 
A: Hoo. 
Q: There was a lot. 

A: It™s a lot in Europe, yeah. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: A lot. And it™s often because people were 
[indecipherable], they get some  help, you know, 
from [indecipherable] so and so, lik
e that they deserved it. Yeah, th
ere™s a lot of -- in Europe too. 
Here, too. 

Q: There was a lot of what? 

A: A lot of anti-Semitism. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Here, too. It™s all over. 

Q: And did you s -- did you feel it when you were in Holland? 

A: No, no -- 
Q: You didn™t? 
A: No, no. Mm-hm. 

Q: Is that because people didn™t 
know you were Jewish, do you think? 
A: I don™t know if they knew. We  
lived in -- the last five years we
 lived in an -- now what™s that 
[indecipherable] four years we lived in di
fferent neighborhood, we exchanged the homes. 
Q: Right. 

A: And didn™t talk about it or nothing, mm-hm.  

Q: So that wasn™t one of
 the reasons why you left? 
A: No, no. Joe -- Joe want to go out too, cause of his family, you know. And to get better.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0516  
52 
 
Q: So, explain again how you got out of the Neth
erlands. There was -- there was someone in the 
United States who -- who sponsored you? 
A: Yeah, a -- a brother from my natural mother. 
He went to Holland too before the war, and he 
was in hiding, and later on he move d to Amst
erdam. And he was -- he had an business in 
Germany, he did car u-upholster work, and he was 
my -- friend of mi ne. And she told me later, 
she said, you know, I had an upholsterer came to 
Germany from Cologne, and he has your name , 
and he could be your unc -- family. I said, nah, 
I don™t care, you know. Don™
t bother. But he kept 

on asking, so finally we went to see him.
 And that was my mother™s brother.  
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: But he was not a nice guy. She was ni
ce, and the daughter, so we went around 
[indecipherable] the daughter, and 
then -- then they left . He told me later -- he came over 
someti mes. I always sent him an sports paper ev
ery week. And he came over and -- and then he 

told us, said, if you want to go to America, he
 said, I can help you. He
 said, but don™t get any 
more children. I had two, he sa
id [indecipherable] harder. So 
-- and he was our sponsor. He 
didn™t pay anything for us, nothing. 

Q: So what does it mean to be a sponsor, what does that mean? 

A: He have to give up his name , that if we in 
trouble or we need money, t hen we have to go to 
him, I guess. 

Q: I see. 

A: He is responsible for us.  

Q: I see. 

A: That™s what it is. 

Q: But you had to raise the money to come  here? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0516  
53 
 
A: No, I told you, I got the 
money from that house --  
Q: Right. 
A: -- from my mother. 

Q: Right. 

A: Yeah, we paid everything. We  pa id
 six -- six -- about 2000. That™s -- 
Q: That™s a lot of money. 

A: It was a lot of money for Holland, yeah. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: We  ca me  here with hundred dollars. 

Q: With a hundred dollars? 

A: Hundred kroner, hundred kroner. Kroner. 

Q: Really? 

A: And my daughter ruined her shoes on the boat, 
I had -- we had to buy shoes, and then the rent, 
and some  food [indecipherable] Joe had the job, a
nd I started to work too, in that little town. 
Q: Now how -- how little were your kids when you came ove r? 

A: Karin was seven, she became eight in Novemb
er. And Josette was -- she was the next day 

four years when we came here.  

Q: So -- so, eight and four. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: And then you had a th
ird child eventually? 

A: Oh, that was later.  

Q: Later. 

A: ™57. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0516  
54 
 
Q: Uh-huh, and when did you -- but you came he re in ™53? 
A: Yeah, mm-hm. 

Q: And whe r e did you go first? 

A: First we went to 
Flemington, Ne w Jersey. 
Q: Uh-huh. Why did you go there? 

A: Because the daughter from
 my uncle lived there. 
Q: Lived there. I see. 

A: She had the chicken fa rm there. And she was -- 

Q: A chicken far m? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: So did you work on the chicken farm?

hm. So -- and the kid -- the oldest went to schoo
l there. I tell that so often -- I call people 
some ti me s on the radi o about that kids have to 
have their own teacher in Vietname se and in 
Spanish. Karin was only two weeks in a school in
 Holland, came  here, the first day she was in 
kindergarten, second day she was in the first grade,
 and the third -- end of
 that week she was in 
second grade. And after a couple of
 months the teacher says, she™
s one of the smartest in the 
class. She wa s very smart. But they -- they don™
t need some body to talk 
in their own language. I 
mean, Josette [indecipherable] when she™d ha
rdly talked. She was not a talker, so -- 
Q: Did you speak English?  You did. And did Jo
e speak English [indecipherable] was from 
school?  

A: Yeah, I got English in school, and I had my de gr
ees. Joe, no. He had -- they went to school in

 I got the -- the baby, I

there, they didn™t know much about it -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- and he knew more when he learned it good fo r so ma ny years, so -- and he couldn™t get 

ahead. So then we had friends -- we were a me

had the swimming pool, the kids went to camp the 
whole summer and all. And he said, what you

bookbinders in, what was it, San Francisco, and in

Q: So then you [indecipherable] 

A: So he went -- 

Q: Uh-huh.

quit and then go some place else. So we stayed 
there, and then we went, ™64. 

Q: And you liked that? 

A: Mm-hm. And Joe found a house there, and 
I went over to see it
, so it was fine. 
Q: That was fine. Did you tell your
 kids about your experience 
during the war when they were 

growing up, or not? 

A: Not everything, no, little. And my  granddaughter 
couple years ago asked me  about things and 
I told her. But no, and I hear from pe ople they do
n™t talk much about it. She knows about that my 
parents and all that. Well, not wh
at we all went through, exactly. I 
wrote an -- I typed a letter on 
the computer and I have it with me , to tell them. And I gave everybody a copy. 

Q: Right. 

A: So they knew it. We  were supposed to tape 
it for my daughter, she gave us some thing for 
Christmas, and when the last time we came from Flor
ida, I said to Joe, we have to do it when we 
there, but we did not, and we lost that thing. So
