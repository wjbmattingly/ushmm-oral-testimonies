Markowicz's  biogr aphy so you c an r emember and s har e his  tes timony after  you leave here today.
 
 
Har r y will s har e with us  his  Fir s t Per son ac c ount of his  exper ience dur ing the Holoc aus t and 
as  a s urvivor  for  about 45 m inutes .  If time allows at the end of our  progr am , we'll have an oppor tunity 
for you to ask Harr y a few questions.  The life s tories  of Holoc aus t s urvivor s  tr ansc end the dec ades .  
What you are about to hear from  Harry is  one indiv idual's  ac c ount of the Holoc aust. We have pr epared 

a brief s lide pres entation to help with the intr oduction.
  
 
We begin with this photograph of Harr y and his s iblings , Ros a and Manfred, or Mani, in 1941.  
Har r y was born on Augus t
 
9, 1937, in Berlin, Germ any.  His par ents , Max and Mar ja, had emigrated 
fr om  Poland s hortly after Wor ld War I.
 
 
This  photo s hows  Har ry's  m other's fam ily ar ound 1914 in Widawa, Poland.  Harry's  m other is 
the s ec ond from  the left in the back  r ow, with the long br aids.  The others in the pictur e are Harr y's  
aunts and unc les, 11 in all, and Harry's  grandm other is  in the m iddle s itting next to her younges t c hild, 
Bolek.  Of those in the photo, only three s urvived Wor ld War II:  Harr y's  mother, her  youngest s ibling 
Bolek,
 
and her sis ter Leonia, thir d from  the left in the back r ow.
 
 
Her e is  a pictur e of Harry's  father , Max, in Ber lin, Germ any, in front of the Reic hs tag building 
ar ound 1919 or 1920.  He had r ec ently arrived from  Poland.
 
 
On this  map of Ger many, the arr ow poi
nts  to Berlin, where Harr y and his  family lived
 w
hen he 
was  born.   In 1938, a fam ily friend, who was  a polic eman, warned the Markowiczes  of an im pending 

outbreak  of violenc e agains t J ews  in Germany.  Harr y and his fam ily es c aped to Antwer p, Belgium.

This  
arr ow s hows  where Antwer p is  loc ated.  
 
 
When Germany invaded Belgium  in May
 
1940, the Mar kowic zes  tr ied to c ros s  the border to 
Fr ance and wer e denied entr y s o they r ented a beac h hous e in La Panne, Belgium.  The s ec ond arrow 
on the left points to that ar ea.  They stayed until Belgium sur render ed to Germany in late May.
 
 
In 1942, Harr y and his fam ily went into hiding in Br us s els .  Harr y and his s iblings  were plac ed 
s eparately in c hildr en's hom es  and with different fam ilies .  Har ry lived with the Vander linde
n fam ily until 

the liberation of Belgium in September
 
1944.  Here we s ee Har ry with Mrs .
 
Vander linden.
 
 
After the war , the Markowic zes  resumed their life in Brus s els.  Her e we s ee Harr y and his  
family in Br us s els .  Harr y and his  par ents  emigrated to the United States in 1951, joining his  s iblings, 
who had em igr ated in 1949 and 1950.
 
 
After arr iving in the U.S. in 1951, Har r y and his  par ents s ettled in Seattle, Washington, wher e 
his  brother  and s is ter  had gone after  their  m ove to the U.S.  He went to the Uni
vers ity of Was hington for 
his  undergr aduate s tudies ; then attended Sim on Fr as er Univers ity in Vanc ouver , Canada, for  his 
graduate degr ee.  At Simon Fr as er , Harr y's  study in linguis tic s and partic ular ly in s ign language led to 
his  c areer working with people
 
with deafness .  After  his  studies  Har r y s pent a year in Franc e.  He would 
r eturn to Fr ance later to wor k for five year s  before bec om ing a Profes s or of Englis h at Galluadet 

University in Was hington, DC, the world's  only univer s ity with progr ams and s ervic e
s specifically 
des igned to ac c omm odate deaf and hard of hear ing s tudents.  It was  es tablis hed by an Ac t of 

Congr ess  in 1864.  After 30 year s  at Galluadet he r etired in 2008.
  
Harr y also taught Englis h as a 
Sec ond Language in Isr ael and Canada, as  well as  Fr enc h in the U.S. and in Canada.
 
 
Sinc e his  retir em ent Harry has  bec ome very involved with this  mus eum .  He pr es ently works  
as  a volunteer in Vis itor Servic es .  You will find him at the Inform ation Desk  on Tues day afternoons.
  
Har r y als o partic ipates in the m us eum's  writing progr am for  s urvivor s .  You c an read s everal of Har r y's  
es s ays  on the Mus eum 's webs ite.
 
 
Har r y and wife Ar lene, whom he m et in Was hington, D.C. but to whom  he propos ed in Fr anc e 
when s he c am e to visit, c elebr ated their 38th Wedding anniv
er s ary on J une
 
26.  Ar lene c ould not be 
her e today but he's ac c ompanied by his  good fr iends  who are here with Harr y in the front row.
 
 
With that, I'd like to ask  you to join m e in welc om ing our Fir s t Per s on, Mr.
 
Har r y Markowic z.
 
 
[Applaus e]
 
 
Har r y, thank 
you s o m uch for joining us  and for  your  willingnes s  to be our Fir s t Pers on today.  
We'll s tar t bec aus e we only have an hour and you have a lot to s hare with us.
 
 
Your  father s ettled in Berlin in 1919 and m arr ied your mother  in 1926.  By the time you wer e 
b
or n in 1937, Hitler and the Nazis  had been in power for four years .  Let's  begin with you telling us  what 
you c an about your par ents  and their lives  prior to your birth. 
 
> > Harr y Markowic z:  As you m entioned, m y par ents  were born in Poland.  Then they emi
gr ated to 
Berlin.  My father was  a bus ines s m an.  He had a wholes ale bus ines s .  He dealt with pelts , skins  fr om 

animals .  They led a kind of middle c las s life.  They wer e s omewhat r eligious , not too r eligious.  This  is  
all hears ay bec aus e I wasn't ar ound.
 
>
>  Bill Bens on:  Of c our se.
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
> > Harr y Mar kowic z:  My  brother and s ister went to s c hool.  I was n't bor n until 1937.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Right.  Your  father  was  a s oldier in the Firs t WorldWar.  Do you know anything at all 

about his  exper ienc e dur
ing the Firs t Wor ld War?
 
> > Harr y Mar kowic z:  The only thing I know is  that he s erved in the Firs t World War in the Polis h Arm y
 
w
hen he was  15.  The Army was  a very diffic ult plac e for J ews .  He was n't dec lared as born until he 
was  alr eady 2 year s  old, I g
ues s. 
 
The idea was  that at 15 if he was c alled up, he wouldn't look lik e he 
was  healthy until an 18
-
year
-
old and wouldn't have been taken but he was  taken.  What he did during 
the war he never talked about.  I assum e he was  in the c avalry bec aus e he knew how to r ide a hors e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  That's  r emarkable.  He actually was  s er ving at age 15 in the Fir s t Wor ldWar.  Wow.
 
How did your  parents  m eet?

> > Harr y Mar kowic z:  They met at a wedding.  It took  plac e
 
--
 
it's
 
--
 
it was  Dans k  then, an international 
c
ity between Poland and Ger m any.  It c hanged s ides  oc c as ionally.  It took  plac e ther e bec aus e, for one 
thing, the groom c
ouldn't go back  to Poland.  He had left Poland to avoid the dr aft als o.  It was  a 
r elative of m y father's , through m arr iage.  The weddin
g took plac e and after war ds  this  r elative 

s uggested m y father take a young wom an from  the people who were at the wedding and pr opos e to 
her .  So he did that.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So he did that?
 
>> 
[Laughter]
 
> > Harr y Mar kowic z:  Yeah.  And within eight days  they wer e m ar r ied.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Do you know what their life was  like living in Ber lin in the late 1920s, what that life was  

like for them ?  Did 
you lear n anything about that?
 
> > Harr y Markowic z:  No.  When I was  young, m y m other tr ied to tell m e about her  life or their lives, 
both in Poland and Germany befor e the war , but I was  not inter ested.  I was n't c urious about it, 
unfortunately.  So I really  don't know.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  One thing you did tell me was  that your father  was  among thos e who thought th
e r ise 

of Nazis m  c ouldn't last, that this  was  tem porar y.  Would you say m or e about that?
 
> > Harr y Markowic z:  Yes .  He and, as you s aid, others as s umed that the wor ld wouldn't let Hitler go 

on.  At s ome point they did c ons ider  leaving.  They had applied for vis as  to c om e to the United States .  

And als o, my father had s ent a large s um of money out of Germany to Ireland wher e my m other had a 
sister. 
> > Bill Bens on:  To Ir eland?
 
> > Harr y Markowic z:  Yes .  J ust in cas e.  The thing was  it was  diffic ult to leave with your  pos s es s ions .  
The Germ ans  enc our aged J ews  to leave but they had to pay an exit tax and als o t hey wer e r es tric ted in 

how m uc h c urr ency they could take out.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  In fact, I think  I read that, as you s aid, J ews  wer e enc our aged to leave a
t that tim e but 

the tax on property that you owned, to take out tax, was  100% of the value of what you wanted to take 
whic h was an extr aordinar y burden for people.
 
 
Kr is tallnac ht or  Night of Broken Glas s  took  plac e Novem ber
 
9 thr ough 10, 1938.  Som etim e 
ar
ound Kr istallnac ht your fam ily fled Berlin for  Belgium.  And just prior to that your father had taken your 
br other and s is ter with him to 
Aac hen
, Ger many, but r etur ned.  Tell us what you c an about the events  
that led firs t to your father 's departur e for  
Aa
ch
en, then the family's  dec is ion to flee Belgium.
 
>> Harry Markowicz:  
Aac hen
 
is  a c ity in Germ any wher e they have s pas , s pec ial m ineral waters.  So 
it's  a r es ort plac e.  He went ther e with the intention of going to Belgium .  Belgium  ac c epted the 
r efugees.
  
They met with a smuggler ther e who took  a large number of people thr ough the for est.  They 
r an into a Dutc h patrol
 
--
 
bec aus e Holland and Belgium ar e c los e to
 
--
 
next to eac h other there and als o 
to Germ any.  They wer e stopped by the Dutc h patrol and turned over to the Germ an authorities .  My 
father and other adults  wer e put in jail.  My br other and s is ter  were plac ed with a J ewis h family in 
A
ac h
en.  A s hor t tim e later  he was  r eleas ed.  What the German authorities  wer e c onc erned about is  
that he had paid 
his  exit tax
 
and the normal taxes  and he had done that.  He had taken his prec aution.  
He had paid taxes  in advanc e, had to pay the exit tax.  So they let him go.  And he had to pr om is e that 

he would leave the c ountr y.  
 
 
So he c ame back to Ber lin with my br other  and s ister and then smuggled him s elf ac r os s into 
Belgium  illegally s om ehow and arr anged for a Belgian man who wor ked in Germany, lived on the 
bor der, on the Belgium s ide, but he c omm uted ever y day.  He ar r anged with this  man by paying a lot of 
m one
y to bring us ac ross  the bor der  as his  fam ily .  So that's  how we got to Belgium.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Tell us about the inc ident pr ior to that.  I think  it was  Kris tallnac ht when a polic eman 
warned your father  that something terrible was  going to happen.
 
>> Ha
r ry Mar kowic z:  Shortly befor e Kristallnac ht this  polic em an us ed to be the fianc Ã©
 
of our nanny, 
pr evious  nanny.  Nannies , young women, could no longer work for Jewis h fam ilies  at that tim e.  It 
pr obably was  my br other and s ister's  nanny.  Anyway, for s om e 
r eas on my father and this  m an who 
was  a polic em an r em ained fr iends .  The polic eman c am e to s ee my father  and told him that he had to 

4 
 
leave the c ountry bec ause s om ething wor s e than had happened s o far  was  going to happen.  He was 
pr obably talking about Kristallnac ht, when ther e was  a nationwide Pogrom in whic h s tores  wer e 
vandalized, hundr eds  of s ynagogues  wer e burned down, 30,000 m en were put in c onc entration c amps .  
All of this was  before the war .  So he warned him.
  
He pr obably had ins ide inform ation bec a
us e 
polic em en, dur ing Kr istallnac ht, had orders not to intervene, not to stop the c rowd that was  attacking 

the J ewis h bus ines s es  and the s ynagogues and s o on.
  
So m y father  took that s erious ly and that's why 
he m ade the attem pt to leave.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And while he was in Aac hen, I believe, you wer e s till at home with your mom and the 

polic e c ame to your house.  What happened then?  I 
think  I 
remem ber they wer e looking for  your 
father? 
 
> > Harr y Markowic z:  Yes .  My mother  and father arr anged a stor y, whic h was  tr ue, he was  going to 

Aac hen.  They didn't m ention he was  going to cros s  the bor der.  So they c onfirm ed the stor y with m y 
m other .  So they let him  go.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You wer e a little boy.  Tell us about the inc ident when you wer e at the border an
d the 

c ar  keys  were mis s ing; you wer e trying to get acros s .
 
> > Harr y Markowic z:  Ther e wer e two events  that happened when we were at the bor der.  One was  

that Hitler was  giving a speec h over  the r adio.  It was  a ver y im portant s peec h about the fate
 
of the 
par t 
of C
zec hos lovakia that was  oc c upied, th
r ee million Germ an
-
s peaking people lived.  It had previous ly 
been part of Germ any until Wor ldWar I.  So at the border  the Germ an guards  wer e inter ested in the 

s peec h.  I don't know if this  was  a Fr enc h border
 
--
 
s orr y, not Frenc h bor der .  The Ger man border or 
the Belgian bor der but either way they wer e interes ted in the speec h.  So they didn't pay m uc h 

attention.
 
 
In the m eantim e, s omebody gave m e the keys  to keep m e bus y, the k eys  to the c ar.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  As
 
you wer e tr ying to get ac ros s the bor der .
 
> > Harr y Markowic z:  Yes .  As  we wer e waiting for  the border guar ds to let us  through.  Then they 
opened the gate.  Wher e ar e the keys ?  [Laughter] 
 
There was  a whole bunc h of keys  on one ring.  This  
m an a
ctually 
owned a garage.  He
 
dealt with a lot of c ar s .  
He had to 
look  for  whic h key it was .  So 
ther e was  this  moment of s us pens e.  Of c ours e, I don't r emember  it.  I was  the guilty par ty.
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  But they m ade it.  So they got into Belgium.  And s o ther e you ar e living in Belgium, in 

Antwerp, Belgium .  The war begins  with the invas ion of Poland in September
 
1939 but then Germany 
invaded Belgium on May
 
10, 1940.  And a few days  later  your fam ily then fled towar ds  Fr anc e to try to 
get to Fr an
c e.  Tell us about your  fam ily's  attempt to m ake it to Fr anc e and what happened onc e you 
got to the bor der between Belgium and Fr anc e.
 
> > Harr y Markowic z:  Right. We wer en't the only ones .  Ther e wer e m aybe a million Belgians  trying to 
get to Fr anc e to esc ape the Germ ans .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  In fact, m y image, as many of us would s ee in a m ovie, you know, hundr eds of 

thousands , a m illion people fleeing on foot and on bikes  and in c arts and c ars .  That's  what it was  like.  

Right? 
 
> > Har r y Markowic z:  Right.  
Not s o m any c ars bec aus e ther e was  no gas.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Right.  Ok. 
 
> > Harr y Mar kowic z:  Ther e was  s till maybe a limited am ount of gas.  My par ents arr anged for
 
--
 
to rent 
a truck with a driver  along with four other fam ilies .  One of thos e families  wa
s  the fam ous man fr om  the 
wedding.
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
> > Harr y Mar kowic z:  He had arr anged my parents ' wedding.  So they took  off towar ds  the c oast.  The 

idea was  that they were going to drive all the way  to the Fr enc h bor der  in this  tr uck.  But when they 
arri
ved on the Belgium  coas t, the dr iver s aid that's  as  far as he goes.  Whatever  reas on he had, maybe 
he was  c onc er ned about getting gas to get back  or  the roads  wer e s o c rowded that he was  c onc erned 

that it was  taking too long.  So he dropped him  off at the 
s ide of the r oad.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  All four fam ilies .  J us t said this  was  it.
 

5 
 
> > Harr y Mar kowic z:  All five inc luding us.  Yeah.  At that point we were reduc ed to walking.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And you have your  belongings with you.  Right?
 
>> Harry Markowicz: 
 
Some belongings .  Yeah.  At s ome point my father  and the r elative, again, the 
one r espons ible for m y par ents' m arr iage, they bought a kind of
 
--
 
I don't k now what you c all them.  It's 
kind of a s ur i, a four
-
wheeler , three
-
wheeler  bike thing that you s ee in res ort towns .  They have them in 
Vir ginia, Virginia Beac h.  So they piled the stuff that they had on it and then they put
 
--
 
the other  fam ily 
had a little gir l my age, 3 years  old.  I was  als o 3.  So they put us  on top.  And the rest of them pus hed 
and pulled this  thing all the way to the border, the Fr ench bor der .
 
 
When we ar rived there, the Frenc h let in Belgians or Dutc h people.  Holland was  als o invaded 
s o people fr om  ther e, too, wer e trying to get into Franc e, as s uming that the Frenc h and the 
B r itis h
 
--
 
becaus e before the Ger mans  invaded Belgium  and Holland and Luxembourg, the Britis h had 
s ent hundr eds of thous ands  of tr oops to Franc e, had dec lared war  on Germany when Poland was  
invaded Septem ber
 
1944.  So thes e troops
 
--
 
s omehow the Germans moved in r apidly.  Part of the 
pr oblem  was that the Belgian king, King Leopold, s urr ender ed on the 18th day of the invas ion without 

warning the Fr enc h or the Englis h.  So the Germans  jus t m oved in, trucked in.  They es s entially 
s ur r ounded the Br itis h and Fr enc h, hundreds of thous ands  of tr oops who wer e on the beac hes  wher e 
we wer e with their equipm ent but pr etty m uc h defens eles s .
  
The Ger m ans had stopped the advanc e 
about 20, 25
 
m iles  back for  s ome r eas on.  Maybe they were under s upplied.  They c ontinued bom bing 
the
 
tr oops on the beac hes  and on the roads .  So that's wher e we were. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So there you are at the bor der tr ying to get ac r os s and you'r e not able to.  What 
happened? 
 
> > Harr y Markowic z:  They didn't let us  c r os s becaus e we wer e s tateles s.
 
>> Bi
ll Bens on: What is  that
 
--
 
why?
 
> > Harr y Markowic z:  We had no nationality.  I was  born in 
`
37.  By that tim e J ews  in many Ger many 
had no c ivil r ights , no c itizens hip.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  No c itizens hip s o you'r e s tateles s.
 
> > Harr y Markowic z:  Stateles s .  Yeah.  So we retr eated a little bit fr om the border.  I don't know, 

m aybe m y par ents  were planning to make another  attem pt at cr os s ing later .  I'm  not s ur e.  They r ented 

a villa on the beach to wait, to s ee what was  going to happen whether the Germ ans were 
going to 
oc c upy the whole c ountry or not.  So that's wher e we ended up for a little while.
 
 
There were Br itis h s oldier s  on the Belgian s ide als o.  My br other  went to the beac h with s ome 
of the older boys .  We were on the beac h.  They went to the water.  The allies  had built a dock .  They 
had driven trucks  into the oc ean to build a pier.  And on the Fr enc h s ide, ther e's  a large c ity, a large 

har bor, Dunkirk .  The s oldiers  wer e being evac uated from ther e but the harbor was  bom bed and the 
s hips  c ouldn't com e close enough to pick  up the s oldier s .  It was  a very s low proc es s . 
 
At that point 
Churc hill called for  people in England to have boats , small boats, or  boats  with low dr aft, to c ome over 

and pick up the s oldiers  off the beac hes and bring them  to the Navy s hips  that wer e out further. 
 
 
My first m em or y dates from then.  My very firs t mem or y, I was n't quite 3 year s  old, I r emember 
being in a ditc h with my mother  next to m e and a whole lot of other people.  Next to me on the road, I 

think  ther e was  an offic er
,  a 
Br itis h offic er.  I don't know how I knew what he was .  His pr es enc e was 
c omfor ting. 
 
He was  s tanding, whic h was  different from us  bec aus e we wer e lying in the ditc h, was  
s tanding and looking through binoc ular s  at the sk y.  I went to s leep.  I wok e up and
 
he was  gone.  I 
as ked my mother  where's  the s oldier  and s he told m e that the s oldiers , plur al, ar e gone.  She was  

r eferr ing to the Britis h s oldier s .
  
At that age, of c ours e, I didn't know what was  going on. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And, of c our s e, the Germ ans now are s weeping towar ds  Fr anc e and they oc c upy the 
little town where you are.  Your fam ily has  no c hoic e, you c an't get into Fr anc e, s o you have to return to 
Antwerp.
 
> > Harr y Mar kowic z:  Right. We went back  to Antwer p.  Started walking.  Along the way
 
--
 
this  I don't 
r em em ber.  My br other  told m e. We were picked up by Germ an truck s  that were c om ing back  fr om the 
fr ont.  They wer e empty.  They wer e going to pick  up m ore s upplies . We weren't the only ones . We 

were on the r oads, walking on the r oads  and blocking them s o they picked us  up and dr ove us  part of 

6 
 
the way to Antwer p.  They als o fed us.  Ther e was  no food available.  Didn't c ar e about whether we 
were J ews and s o on.  So we got back  hom e, Antwerp.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  After that whole effor t you're back  at home in Antwer p. What was  life like then now 

under the German oc c upation onc e you were back  in Antwer p?
 
> > Harr y Mar kowic z:  Pretty s oon the Ger mans  started for c ing various  dec r ees  affec ting Jewis h life.  

J ews  had to r egis ter .  The Ger mans  s et up a Jewis h c ounc il.  They s elec ted s om e known people, 

well
-
known eminent people from  the J ewis h c ommunity, put them in c harge.  All the Ger m ans dealt with 
were the or der s and s o on.  It was  up to the J ewish c ounc il to enfor c e them.  Ther e were s ome people 

who ser ved as  J ewis h polic em en.
  
So bes ides r egis ter ing with the J ewis h c ounc il ther e was  c urfew, 
J ews  c ouldn't own r adios, c ouldn't teac h, c ouldn't be pr ofes s ors , c ouldn't be c ivil s er vants .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And even own bikes .
 
> > Harr y Markowic z:  Couldn't even own bik es.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Right.
 
> > Harr y Markowic z:  Car s  in general wer e r equisitioned and bes ides there was  no gas  for c ivilians.  
Eventually they s tarted taking over the J ewis h bus ines s es .  All of this was  done gr adually, s tep

s o that you got us ed to one r estriction and then a new one was  im pos ed.  It was n't all at onc e.  It was  

like, oh, yeah, we c an take this one
 a
nd s o on.   
 
> > Bill Bens on:  I'm going to skip you for ward a will little bit.  Fr om Antwer p, your  par ents made the 
dec is ion to move to Br uss els .
 
In Septem ber
 
1942 after having been in Br us s els  for about 18 m onths  
under the c ircum stanc es that you touc hed on, at that point your parents made a pr ofound dec is ion and 

that was  to put the family  into hiding. What led up to their dec is ion, as  best you know, about why they 
felt they needed to go into hiding in September of 1942? 
 
> > Harr y Markowic z:  Dur ing that period after the oc c upation of Belgium, unlike in other c ountr ies  in the 
eas t like Poland, in the wes t Germ ans didn't s et up ghettos .  They didn't bother women and c hildr en.  
The
 
only thing that they did
 
--
 
"o
nly thing"
 
--
 
they took able
-
bodied men to wor k, work for  Germ any for 
factor ies , for  farms .  The s elec tion was  done actually by
 
--
 
in fact, they also sent mos t of them to 
no
r thern Fr anc e to build fortific ations .  Hitler  was  planning to invade England next.  They expec ted a 
r epris al s o they built these for tific ations  along the c oas t.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Us ing for c ed labor.
 
> > Harr y Markowic z:  Forc ed labor and s lave labor.
 
>> Bil
l Bens on:  Slave labor ?
 
> > Harr y Markowic z:  Yes .  My father was  c alled up to go to work.  He was  s uppos ed to go r eport at the 

tr ain station one day.
  
Initially, people who were taken would s end pos tc ards  home s aying ever ything's  
fine, we got food and s o o
n.  It was  the Germ ans  forc ed them to write these car ds.  So at first people 
tr usted that it was  ok  but other people didn't
 
--
 
m y father  didn't tr us t them  so he dec ided he was n't going 
to go.
  
At that point we left Antwer p wher e we were regis tered and m oved to Brus s els.  And there my 
par ents didn't r egister us.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So in a s ens e, in m oder n language, they went off the grid by moving to Br us s els  where 
they wer e not r egis tered.
 
> > Har r y Markowic z:  Right.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Ok .  I think  you des c r ibed that to me as at that point you weren't hidden but now you're 
living
 
--
 
I think your word was  s or t of anonym ous ly.
 
> > Harr y Mar kowic z:  Yeah, I guess  that would des c r ibe it.  Until the s um mer of 
`
42; that's when the 
Germ ans dec ided on the final solution.  The final s olution was  the exterm ination of all J ews in the 
oc c upied c ountr ies .  So that's when we went into hiding.
 
 
It was n't nec es s ar ily m y parents' ideas.  Ther e wer e underground organizations , J ewis h and 
others, who wer e s uggesting that people go into hiding but als o that the families  s plit up to incr ease the 

c hances  of the c hildr en surviving.  They wer e to give up their  c hildren to various  ins titutions  like 
or phanages  or  c onvents where you c ould pas s
 
--
 
c hildren c ould pas s for non
-
J ewis h and
 
the par ents  
s eparately.
 

7 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Before you go on, Harr y, am I c orr ec t in m y m emory that one of the events  that 
happened is  that your par ents m oved out of their  hous e tempor a
ri
ly when the Germ ans c ame in and 
took literally an entire c omm unity and deported them  while your fam ily was away fr om that? 
 
> > Harr y Mar kowic z:  Yes .  Ther e had been r aids that took  plac e at night in Antwer p in August of 1942.  
There were two raids.  They c ame with trucks, s urr ounded the J ewis h ar eas , and they had the 
addr es s
es, s pec ific addres s es , where J ews  lived.  In Antwer p they had the help of the Antwerp polic e.  
In fact, the Antwer p polic e on their own did a third r aid.  They picked up whole families .  They weren't 
looking for just young m en.  They took  young people, babies , c hildren, old people, s ick people, 
ever ybody, the whole fam ilies .
 
 
The word got back to Brus s els  and fr om  that point on we didn't s leep at our  apar tm ent.  At 
night we s tayed with my
 
--
 
m y mother had a br other who lived nearby but outs ide of this  J ewi
s h 
neighbor hood wher e we lived.  So we went ther e in the beginning of Septem ber, I think September
 
2, 3.  
They did the s ame thing, s urr ounded the neighbor hood where we lived and took  ever ybody who was  

ther e.  Since we wer en't there, we weren't picked up.  That's when we went into hiding.
 
> > Bill B ens on:  So tell us
 
--
 
you end up being s ever al plac es .  Tell us what happened to you, your 
s iblings , your parents , onc e the dec is ion was  made to hide.
 
> > Harr y Markowic z:  Thes e underground organizations  helped to find hiding places , even befor e m y 

par ents handed us  over, my br other, s ister  and I, to an elderly c ouple they knew fr om the 

neighbor hood.  They paid them .  They asked them  to move and paid them  to move to another  
neighbor hood wher e they wouldn't be known 
s o we c ould pas s  for their relatives .  So that's  what they 
did.  The elderly c ouple m oved.
 
 
Shor tly after
 
--
 
I have no idea how long.  Maybe weeks, m onths .  They dec ided to move back  
to the old neighborhood s inc e all the J ews  there had been taken away.  Ther e wer e lots of apartments , 

nic e apar tm ents , available.  So they moved back  to the old neighborhood whic h was  not ideal.  And 
als o their gr ands on, 18 years  old, he lived with them.  And at s om e point he dec ided to join the fas cis t 
group affiliated with the fas c is t politic al party in Belgium.  He might not have tur ned in his grandparents  
but it s till was  not an ideal s ituation.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Right.  He c ould have denounc ed them for hiding J ewis h c hildren.  Right.  So then 
what happened next? 
 
>> Harr y Ma
r kowic z:  My  s is ter and I wer e put in a villa out in the c ountrys ide.  I don't know muc h about 
it.  Ther e wer e other  kids there.
  
My br other c am e to vis it us  and found out that there were J ewis h 
adults  s o that made it more dangerous .  He told m y m other and
 
we wer e taken away from there.  I don't 
know how this  happened.  I don't r em em ber .  But we were taken away fr om  ther e.
  
In the meantime I 
would s tay with my parents .  My br other and s ister  stayed in a c ommerc ial laundr y wher e they hid.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  In
 
a laundry.
 
> > Harr y Markowic z:  In a laundry.  Every time we wer e between plac es.  I was  in four plac es.  My 
br other was  in seven.  And m y s is ter
 
--
 
but the next plac e, this  villa.  Then the next one was  on the 
outskirts  of Br us s els
.  A
cr os s  the s tr eet wer e farms .  There was  an ar ea
, 
I think it was  built by the 
m unic ipality for  working c las s  people.  My s is ter and I wer e taken in by a family, the Vander lindens .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  The Vanderlindens .
 
> > Harr y Mar kowic z:  Yes .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And you would be with them  for a while.  Tell us about life with the Vander lindens , 
inc luding they actually m oved into Brus s els  while you wer e with them.  Right?
 
> > Harr y Mar kowic z:  Right.  My s is ter  and I were ther e with them  for s om e time.  What I didn't know 

was  that m
y brother was  living with another family  just a few blocks away.  They didn't tell me bec aus e 
they wer e afraid if I r evealed it to s omebody els e to my friends.  So I didn't know it.
  
My sis ter  knew it 
but s he didn't know wher e he was.
 
 
I was  ac tually going
 
to s chool.  They put m e in a sc hool.  Belgium was  a binational c ountry, 
bic ultur al, two languages us ed:  Frenc h and Flemis h.  This  was a Flem is h ar ea.  I didn't k now Flemis h.  

And the s c hool was  a Catholic  s c hool.  The teac her s  wer e nuns.  We wer e taken t
o c hur c h.  S o I 
c ouldn't really talk  to the other kids .
 

8 
 
 
One day, an older boy, maybe 10 year s  old, I was  about 6, c ame over  to m e and he was  
s peaking Fr enc h.  He was  J ewis h, too. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  I think you told me there wer e a few kids  in the s c hool who spoke French, everybody 
els e s poke Flemis h, and the kids who s poke Fr enc h wer e the hidden J ewis h kids .
 
> > Harr y Mar kowic z:  Right.  He introduc ed m e to the other kids who s poke Fr enc h and they wer e all 
J ewis h kids .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  In this  Catholic  s c hool.  At this  time, where wer e your  parents ?
 
> > Harr y Mar kowic z:  My  par ents  lived in a building that looked like it was  vac ant.  They had an 

apar tm ent.  The landlor d knew they were there.  They paid r ent.  There were neighbor s who lived 
ac r os s the s treet wh
o s hopped for  them and br ought the food over.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And they did this  at risk .  Right?
 
> > Harr y Markowic z:  They did it at great r isk to them s elves , the whole family.  Yes .  They were very 

c our ageous  to do that.
 
 
There was  als o another J ewis h family in the building.  The older  boys  were taken away to 
work fir s t and then the mother and the young daughter went out to the s tore that was  on the street and 
they wer e arr ested.  Norm ally the mother didn't go out but s he did that day.  A lot of this was  all c hanc e. 
 
Then there was  just the father and two more kids .  They m oved out. We have no idea what happened 

to them. 
 

> > Bill Bens on:  Tell us
 
--
 
with the Vander linden
s
, you're living, as  you desc ribed, in the c ountrys ide but 
they then m oved into the c ity, into Br us s els, taking you with them.  What prompted them to make that 

m ove and then what was  that like living with them in their hous ehold in Brus s els ? 
 
>> Harry Marko
wic z:  Wher e my br other  was  staying there were als o two other J ewis h kids .  One day 
the Ges tapo c am e.  The Ges tapo ar e s ecr et polic e.  This  was from intelligenc e.  They c am e to look  not 

for the J ewis h kids  but they c ame to look for the adult s on of the family who was  wor king in Germany 
on the r ailr oad.  The Germ ans  r ec r uited Belgians  to work in Germ any.  And when they c ouldn't get any
 
m or e volunteer s, they took  them  by forc e.  And this  young man was  working in the r ailroad yard with 

s ever al other Belgians . 
 
They were given leave to go home for five days  but it took them three days  to 
get hom e.  Not bec aus e it takes  that long
 
--
 t
o take the tr ain fr om Germany to Belgium it's  a s hort 
dis tanc e 
--
 
but bec aus e the trains  weren't r unning bec aus e they wer e bombed by the allies .  So they 
were late going back  home.  And when they got bac k
 
--
 
I'm s orr y, not back  home.  They wer e late going 
bac k  to work  in Germ any.
  
In the m eantime, the railroad yar d where they wer e wor king had been 
bom bed s o the Germans ar res ted them s us pecting that one or m or e of them  was  a s py and provided 
the allies  with inform ation.  
 
 
So the Gestapo intelligenc e c am e to the hous e, his  parents ' hous e, this one guy, and 
s ear ched the hous e.  They wer e looking for  a radio tr ansm itter.  They didn't find
 
any.
  
Befor e they left 
they told my brother  and the other two kids  in German
 
--
 
they told them, "We'll be back for you 
tomorr ow."  So m y brother , he knew where we were.  He c am e to get m y s is ter and I and we
 
left the 
ar ea.  In fac t, later m y brother found
 
out they never  c ame back.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  They did not c om e back .
 
> > Harr y Mar kowic z:  Not all Germans  were interes ted in getting J ewis h kids .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  For the Vanderlindens , if I remem ber c orr ec tly, your parents  pers uaded or paid the 
Vander linde
ns  to m ove into Brus s els  and that was  a big move for them but they did and they took  you 
with them .
 
> > Harr y Mar kowic z:  Right.  So after this I went to s tay with my parents for a while again.  This 

pr obably
 
--
 
I don't know how it was  arr anged but pr obably
 
through the underground.  My par ents, again, 
as ked the Vander lindens to move into Br us s els where they wouldn't be known.  So they had to give up 
their jobs, c hange what they wer e doing.  They agreed to do it.  They took  me with them then.  My 
sister was e
ls ewhere after that.  I was  on my own bec aus e I was  already us ed to them.  My s is ter was  
with m e bec aus e of the separ ation
 
--
 
I was  5 at firs t, 5, 6.  It was  diffic ult for m e.  
 
 
So I went back to live with the Vander lindens  and nobody knew them s o I could
 
pas s  for their 
s on.  So I c ould go outs ide.  I went to s c hool again.  This  tim e in Fr enc h.  I gues s  life was  alm os t 

9 
 
nor mal.  I didn't know about life outs ide of the war.  I didn't know what life was  like s o this  was  normal.  
My family was  never norm al. 
 
>
>  Bill Bens on:  One of the things  that you s hared with m e was  that you des c ribed your  parents wer e 
living in what appear ed to be a vac ant building.  The landlor d knew they were there.  Tell us about the 
ar r angement, the c ir c ums tanc es I think , with a beauty
 
s hop. 
 
> > Harr y Mar kowic z:  My  m other us ed to go outs ide.  She c ould pas s  for Jewis h as  far as  appearanc e 
goes.  She was  blond and had blue eyes .  Bleac h blond. 
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
> > Harr y Mar kowic z:  She was  jus t ar ound the c or ner from their plac e when s he s aw Germ an s oldiers  
walking in her direction.  So s he s or t of panicked.  She was  just happened to be in front of a beauty 
par lor s o s he went in.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  To get away from the Germans .
 
> > Harr y Markowic z:  Right.  She went ins ide.  The beauty par lor
 
owner

m any s mall stores people 
lived in the back  of the store or above the store.  She waved to c om e into the back  of the stor e.  My 
m other  was  afr aid to go.  The wom an told her
,  
"My hus band's  J ewis h and he's  hiding."  He was  in the 
apar tm ent in the back .  So m y m other  went.  They bec am e fr iends .  
 
 
It just happened that there wer e gar dens in the bac k .  All the gar dens had tall walls , brick 
walls  nearly 10
 
feet high.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Adjac ent to where your  mom and dad were hiding.  Ok.  So it was  adjac e
nt to it.  Ok . 
 
> > Harr y Markowic z:  Right.  Although it was  around the c or ner .  So they ar ranged that if the Germans  
c am e to either plac e, they would jump the wall, take a ladder, go acr os s the wall to the other plac e.  A 
num ber of tim es my parents  went over  the wall.  There was  a Rus s ian who lived in the building next 
door  and the Germans  cam e s ever al times to look  for  him.  They c ame and my par ents saw the c ar  out 

fr ont.  They didn't know who it was  for
. T
hey would go over the wall to s tay with the other
 
family. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  I k now ther e's s o muc h that we're skipping over, Har ry, but as we get towards  the end 

of the progr am , I want you to tell us about, of c ours e, liber ation and getting reunited with your  par ents .  I 
think  in August or  Septem ber
 
1944
, your m other c am e and took  you out of the Vanderlinden hom e as  
the Germans wer e r etreating.  And then not long after that you wer e liberated.  Tell us  about your 
m other  c oming to get you and then about your liber ation.
 
> > Harr y Markowic z:  One day my mother s howed up to the Vanderlinden's .  She s aid s he was  taking 
m e hom e with her.  It was kind of a s hock  bec ause I didn't know why the Germ ans were s till there.  I 
had grown ver y c los e to Mr s .
 
Vander linden.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Bec ause they were kind people to y
ou.
 
> > Harr y Markowic z:  They wer e very kind.  She was  very affectionate.  We played games together .  

Hide and s eek.  So m y mother  s aid, well, I c an come back  later  but for the tim e being s he wanted m e to 
c om e home with her. 
 
 
So I left ther e.  On the way,
 
we wer e in a str eet car  and we didn't talk.  My  mother didn't know 
Fr ench s o we talked in Ger m an
 a
nd that would have been a giveaway.  But s he whis pered to m e.  I 
was  s tanding next to the window in the street car.  She s aid, "Look ."  So I looked outs ide. 
 
There was  a 
little Ger man truck  next to the s treet car .  It was  being pulled by a hors e.  Could have run out of gas .  I 

don't know.  And on top of the tr uck  there was  a Germ an s oldier  lying flat on the top with a heavy 
m ac hine gun and he kept looking around at the building.  I didn't r ealize what was  going on.  My m other 
s aid, "Look , the Germ ans  ar e running away."  So s he s aid "Rem em ber this always ." 
 
Later I r ealized 
the German was  s c ared because the Belgians  r es is tanc e was  attacking Ger mans at this 
point, throwing 

Molotov c oc k tails  at them, s hooting at them .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And he's fleeing with a hors e
-
drawn truck at that point.  And you remember s eeing 
m en in over alls  c oming out with large boxes  and opening them filled with r ifles  and that was  the
 

r es is tanc e arm ing themselves  and the other Belgians  at that point.
 
> > Harr y Mar kowic z:  Yeah. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Tell us
 
--
 
your  m om, now you'r e with your  mom.  She took  you to the park
, t
he 
neighbor hood park .  And you des c r ibed that as a sc ene of happy pa

> > Harr y Mar kowic z:  Right.  One m or ning after I had been ther e a few days  with my par ents  my 
m other  s ays  we're going to the park.  She probably s aid mor e but I didn't k now what s he was  talking 
about.  The day before we c ould hear like s hooting,
 
c annons s hooting, in the dis tanc e.  I gues s s he 
pr obably told m e that the allies  are ther e.  I was  7.  I didn't quite know what was  going on.
  
I did ask  her  
why my 
fa
ther was  not coming.  She's c om ing out and s he s ays , well, he hadn't been out for two yea
rs , 
has n't s een people, it's jus t too muc h for  him to come.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So only your m om had been going out, not your  father.  Ok . 
 
> > Harr y Mar kowic z:  Yeah.  So we were s or t of going towar ds  the park .  Ther e wer e all kinds  of people 

going at the s am
e tim e, lots  of people
, g

was  on fire.  I was  fas c inated by the fir e s o I stopped to look .  My m other grabbed m e.  Ther e were 

m or e and m or e people.  Everybody was  r us hing.  Then we arr ived in the park and it was  a s c ene
 
--
 
I 
knew the wor ld had c hanged for  m e at that point.  Ther e wer e tank s .  It was  the Br itis h Arm y that 
liberated Br uss els .  There wer e all of thes e tanks all over and people, c ivilians , all over  on the tank s, 
kis s ing the s oldier s , gi

>> 
[Laughter] 
 
> > Harr y Mar kowic z:  They make the best beers.
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
> > Harr y Mar kowic z:  So m y mother took me over
.  T
her e was  a tank  with one s oldier  standing on it.  
We looked up.  He looked down.  We c ouldn't c omm unic ate exc ept by looking.  Then he put out his  
ar m s, leaned over, and my m other pus hed, held m e up.  He pulled m e up in his  ar ms.  I looked at m y 
m other .  She s aid, "Give him a kis s.."  So I kis s ed him.  And then I looked down and m y m other was  
c r ying.  So that was  ver y  dis tur bing.  I didn't know why s he was  cr ying.  It didn't s eem to bother  the 
s oldier  bec aus e he kept s m iling.  My mother tr ied to tell m e that there was  nothing wrong; s he was  

c r ying out of happines s.
 
> > Bill Bens on: 
 
So that was  liber ation.  And at this  point your brother  and s is ter are s till els ewhere.

> > Harr y Markowic z:  Right.  My br other and
 
s ister  by this tim e wer e s taying eac h with a family in then 
was  the mountainous  area of Belgium.  My par ents  c ouldn't ac tually go there bec aus e the tr ains  wer e 
s topped running or were us ed by the allies  for trans porting mater ial.  You had to get permis s io
n to 
tr avel.  So it took  a little while.  Then eventually they got permis s ion.  The tr ains  wer e r unning.  So I 
went bac k  to live

to s tay with the Vander lindens .  It tur ned out that my brother and s ister, by this tim e, 
they wer e m aking arr angements to c om e to Brus sels  and were tr aveling to Brus s els  and m y parents 
were going there.

[Laughter] 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Your parents  actually had a pretty fr ightening exper ienc e when they were on their way 

to get your  br other and s is ter.

.  On the tr ain

m aybe this  was  a s treet c ar.  I'm  not s ur e.  They were 
whis per ing to eac h other in German.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Bec ause that's their language.  They whis per ed to eac h other in German.
 
> > Harr y Markowic z:  Yeah.  They wer e overheard by people
.  They got ver y ups et.  They thought they 

were Germ ans .  [Laughter ]
 
 
The Belgian people hated the Germ ans  not only bec aus e they occupied WorldWar II but 
bec aus e they had been oc c upied in Wor ld War I.  Both tim es they had dec lar ed thems elves  neutral.  
Bot
h times  they wer e invaded by the Ger mans to get to Fr anc e, the eas iest way for  the Germans to do 
that.
   
InWorld War I s om e of the m ajor battles  took  plac e in Belgium and als o the Germ ans m is treated 
the c ivilians  very badly.  So ther e was n't a lot of love
 
for  Germans.  Ther e wer e c ollaborators  for various  
r eas ons , like in the occ upied c ountr ies there were people who c ollabor ated with the Germans. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So they hear  your  par ents s peaking.
 
>> Harry Markowicz:  Oh, yes.  I'm sorry.
 
> > Bill Bens on:
  
They hear your par ents whis pering in Germ an and they're in c harge s o they'r e ups et.

> > Harr y Mar kowic z:  Right.  They wer e thr eatened.  I don't know what would have happened.  But a 
polic em an c am e and r esc ued my par ents.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So by the tim e your  fam ily is  back  together in Brus s els , it's  the fall of 1944 and, of 

c our se, the war  would c ontinue until May
 
1945.  You wer e liber ated r elatively early.  J us t as  we get 
c los e to ending, were your  par ents
 
--
 
war is  still going on in Europe very muc h s o. 
 
Wer e they able to 
jus t sor t of r es um e their lives  during that per iod? 
 
> > Harr y Mar kowic z:  Yes , they did.  They c ame out of hiding.  Offic ially m y father  was n't s upposed to 
work.  He was s o involved in black m ark ets, things  like foreign c ur renc y
 
--
 
not f
or eign c ur renc y, the 
dollar  and the pound.  He had done this befor e when he fir s t got to Belgium .  He dealt in c urr enc ies .  

They rented a hous e.
 
 
When we wer e fir st liberated and after m y br other , m y s is ter  and I c ame, we s tayed in their  
little apartment wher e they had been hiding.  It was  a very s mall apar tm ent.  And als o they took in a 

c ous in, my unc le's  daughter who was  left.  My unc le, m y aunt and their s on wer e arr es ted.  They were 
denounc ed jus t befor e the liberation
 
in
 
August or  maybe July, J uly or Augus t.  Brus s els  was
 
liberate

.  J
ust before they wer e s ent to Aus chwitz on the last tr ain that got out there.  Ther e was  
another train at the end of August but by that time the Germ ans  were routed and the tr ain didn't leave.  
My aunt c am e back.  But before s he c ame back  m y par ents  took in their daughter who was  hidden like I 
was , pr obably with a family. 
 

> > Bill Bens on: We s aw ear ly in the pic tures, in the s lide pres entation, I believe 11 aunts  
and unc les.  
So you had a large
 
extended fam ily. 
 
When did your par ents and your family lear n the fate of m ost of 
your  fam ily? 
 
> > Harr y Mar kowic z:  It took  a while.  Gr adually
 
--
 
I don't know what it was  like but I know the plac e in 
Paris  was  a hotel wher e the Ges tapo us ed it to
 
--
 
the Ges tapo oc c upied 
dur ing the war.  Any way, there 
were people ther e who m ade up the lis t of people who wer e ac c ounted for , alive.  Every day my aunt 

went bac k  to this plac e to find out the fate of her hus band and her  s on.  I'm s or ry.
 
> > Bill Bens on: When your fam ily r eally lear ned what happened, that s o m any of your fam ily m em bers 

had per is hed.
 
> > Harr y Markowic z:  They never  talked about it.  We never  talked about anything related to the war .  It 
was  like a taboo s ubject.  I knew that the fam ily, v er y few were left but we never  talked about it.  There 
were s om e r are oc c as ions .  Onc e, one of my 
nieces
 
had a high sc hool projec t.  She had to inter view a 
grandpar ent.  I happened to be ther e s o s he interviewed m y mother about her life.  So I heard that.  

And then the part about the war.  My father c ouldn't help but make s om e comm ents then.  He 
m entioned the polic em an.  I wouldn't know otherwis e
 a
bout this  polic eman who war ned him to leave.
 
> > Bill Bens on: We'r e r eally at the end of the pr ogram.  We haven't had an opportunity for 
you to as k  
Har r y ques tions but Har ry will m ake a c los ing remark in a m oment. When he's  finis hed, he's going to

you'd like to ask  him, if you just want to

It's  our  tr adition at

Harry?
 
> > Harr y Markowic z:  I'd like to thank the audience for c om ing today.  Als o, I'd like to take this 
opportunity to pay tr ibute to the many br ave Belgians , m ostly ordinar y people, who
 
par tic ipated in the 
r es c ue of J ews  thereby putting thems elves  at great risk, inc luding their families .  A little more than half 

of the J ews  in Belgium sur vived the war.  This  is even m or e rem arkable when you c ons ider that 90% of 
the J ews  living in Belgium
 
dur ing the German occ upation wer e for eigners, m os tly r efugees fr om 
Germ any, Austr ia, and Poland.
