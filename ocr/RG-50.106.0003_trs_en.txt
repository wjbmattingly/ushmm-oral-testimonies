SUZANNE FOLDES
 
January 25, 1996
 
                                                         
Question: The following is an interview of Suzanne Foldes [ph].  It is taking place on 
January 25th, 1996 in Silver Spring, Maryland and is being conducted by Ga yle Schwartz 

[ph]. Could you tell us your full name?   

Answer: Suzanne Foldes [ph], with the middl e initial M. for Marth
a.
 
Q: And your maiden name?  

A: Was Morwa y [ph]. 

Q: And where were you born?  
A: In Miskolc [ph], Hungary. 
Q: And when were you born?  

A: June 23rd, 1921. 

Q: Can you tell me a little bit about your family, who made up your fami ly? 

A: It was a very small family.  I was a only child.  My father then already came back 

from two years of Worl d War I in Russia, and after that two years as POW.  My mother 
was from t he other part  of Hungary and the y got married ri ght after World War I where 
the country was spl it between two parts, Communist part and a non-Communi st part.  

And the y had to st art al l over after that again.  But the y had been very successful.  My 

father as a businessman was very, very well off. 

Q: What ki nd of business was he i n? 

A: The y had men clothing which entailed t ailoring which entailed upper coats and suits 

of every fashion.  Not [haphhazard ?] like here.  That was the line of my first husband's 

Interview with Suzanne Foldes

family.  But the y were strictly men clothi ng and they were three part ners to it, t hree 
young men who learned the trade t ogether and at the same place and became very good in 

the trade.  

Q: Would you describe your family as upper class or middle class? 
A: 
Middle clas
s, and my father was really a self-made man.  He was t he son of a [sem?] 
religious teacher who had a lot of children and constantly moving on from one pl ace to 

the other where there were enough Jewish boys to teach and prepare.  So while my father 

was the oldest boy, he went out and had no chance of education, formal educati on, but he 

was working only that his younger brothers all should have and he was able to gi ve that 

to them and was al wa ys [shortening?] the whole family.  Not that it meant too much of a 

-- how should I sa y -- really not miss anything because of that.  It was different in m y 
mother's parents' case.  My mother's parents were the richest wholesal ers in Watz [ph]     
where the y l ived, which changed drastically i n the 1930s when my mother's sister 

married a man who rui ned the fami lies, so much so that the y left the town and moved up 

to Budapest and di dn't want to be seen and known by nobody that they are having 

financial problems t he y didn't have because their sons and daught ers made sure t hat the y 

should not  miss anything, but, of course, they were not in the way they used to be and 

they were suffering -- they were ashamed not t o live the life what originally was meant to 
be lived by them. 
Q: Can you describe the town that you lived i n?  How big was t he town? 

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
5 
A: Miskol c [ph] is the capital of Northern Hungary.  It's a big well, well run place which 
had a lot of factories around it. So business was always a capital pl ace where people 

came from t he whol e surrounding.  And i t had over 10,000 Jews. 

Q: Out of -- do you know what the overall population -- 
A: It was 60,000 popul ation, which came -- became later 100,000 wit h the outer parts 
growing into it.  The -- the Jewish community had different synagogues, from ort hodox 

to where the rabbi only spoke Yiddish, to anot her one whi ch had a rabbi who had the 

doctorate and spoke Hungarian, and the third one which was so religious a small-town 

religious li ke Southmar [ph] is and the y li ved separately in their own l ittle ghetto within 

it. Within the 
--  
Q: Did you have a l arge extended family in the town? 
A: My father's family l ived there.  He had sisters and brot hers and, of course, the sisters' 
and brothers' children. 

Q: Did you get together with the family on holida ys and 
--
  
A: Not really.  Not reall y.  But yes, of course, we went to visit them i n the synagogue.  

Yes, we met them t ime to time. Of course we went to visit at thei r house.  But it  was not a 

close relationship.  My mother and her in-laws were just fine but i n a cool wa y.  It never 

warmed up to a level where the y were really fi ne with their family, and so, of course, I 
was not part of the famil y there. 
Q: How religious was your family?  What kind of religious background did you have? 

A: We had strictly orthodox kosher house, but  it was mainly to in respect of the parents 

who wouldn't have eaten otherwise at our house.  And then I was 17 and both of my set 

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
6 
of grandparents died within a year.  After that it was still kosher because the y were used 
to having t heir wa ys, but it was no such thing anymore that I coul dn't bring into the house 

something what before couldn't  be brought in.  

Q: Did you celebrate holidays, -- 
A: Oh, sure. 
Q: -- religious holi da ys and -- 

A: Oh, sure. 

Q: -- observe Shabbat? 

A: Yes.  Well, observe Shabbat, yes, but my father's store was open.  It wasn't open only 

on [shoppershu] and the three days of the high holidays.  Yes, m y --  

Q: Did you go to Hebrew school?  Did you have any religious trai ning? 
A: There was -- there was in -- not Hebrew school, but in the regular school where we 
went we had a teacher come in and give us twice-a-week rel igious lessons which was not 

taken too seriously, neither by the congregation to send a proper teacher, nor the children 

who, of course, went as much for it as the fami lies went for it.  But it was more t han the      

American children had. 

Q: What ki nd of school  did you go to?  Was this a public school? 

A: No, none was public school.  I first -- elementary school I went  to the Jewish 
elementary, which was huge.  It was for 1,000 children, which meant up to six grades 
they had.  I went there four grades and from there I went to the Protestant gimnazium 

because that was the school to go to. The Jewi sh children had to pay double of the 

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
7 
quarter.  The  
Cathol ics one
-and-a-half times only.  But we were different, definitely 
different, but we were allowed to go at least. 

Q: What -- what part of the school was Jewish, do you remember, approximately? 

A: Well, it depended on classes. 
Q: Yeah.  
A: My class, out of the 50 we had 18 Jewi sh gi rls and we were fighting because by the 

time we grew -- we were growing into first [Jewish low Hitler] and some girls in the 

summer went to Germany to camp, others had the Nazis of Hungary with rings on their 

hand and we were fighting fistfights with them.  [They have -- with their debt]. 

Q: 
Mm
-hmm.  Um, what about your friends?  Did you have --  
A: The friends were Jewish. 
Q: Were Jewish? 
A: Not true, because I did have one or two non-Jewish friends, but they were not that 

close because the children could have been very close and we went t o school together and      

everything was fine, but the parents of that group did not really want t heir daughters to 

mix so much with the Jews, so we were not kept very close with them. 

Q: Did you live in a Jewish neighborhood? 

A: No.  
Q: So it was a mixed neighborhood? 
A: It's a very mixed neighborhood. 

Q: Was there any problem in the early -- obviously we'll get t o the '30s later on, but in the 

beginning was there -- do you recal l any problem? 

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
8 
A: No, there was not. 
Q: (Inaudible) -- child? 

A: Actually there was no problem where we lived until 1944 when they pushed us in t he 

ghettoes.  
Q: Oka y.  And did you have any hobbies? 
A: Oh, God knows.  I wouldn't have called it hobbies. 

Q: Other interests besi des school? 

A: 
Ibelieve that my lifeis 
dependi ng on that we go to the Olympics.  I was a sports 
person and yes, I was prepared for the 1936 Olympics and Hitler didn't want me. 

Q: In what sport? 

A: Gymnastics. 
Q: Gymnastics.  So you took that  very seriously? 
A: Very, very seriously, and I was very talented too. 

Q: And you had -- did you have private instruction? 

A: No, but I belonged to a sport club of which teacher was m y teacher at school, too, so 

we were just going into that and get all the meets what sportsmen have right there.  We 

had sports clubs there.  We had training grounds there.  

Q: And you thought -- and it was t hought  that you were good 
enough topossibly qualify 
for the --  
A: I was.  

Q: That high? 

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
9 
A: Was expected that I will qualify for the high school, the academic that I woul d be 
going there, but, of course, Jew couldn't go there by the time. 

Q: But you were of the caliber to be able to compete.  Yeah. Um, what -- did you belong 

to any youth groups? 
A: Yes, but it was unorthodox way because the Girl Scouts were not supposed t o have 
Jews, but the Girl Scout leader, the teacher leader, wanted me to go al ong with t hem 

because I was so good and I was ready to pull the kids up if they had difficulty going up 

on a mountainside, so I was with t hem. 

Q: So you were a member of the non -- the Girl Scouts? 

A: An unofficial member, because officially I couldn't  be.  A Jew couldn't be. 

Q: And how did you -- you were a young girl.  How did you feel about that?  Did that 
bother you 
--  
A: Probably. 
Q: -- that unofficially 
--
  
A: Probably didn't even realize that that's hol ding me back from anything, because it 

didn't hold me back.  It was probably more showing that my friends are in Jewish     

communiti es and not there, but I was really comfortable until I -- I was part of it. 

Q: Yeah.  Did you belong to any Zionist youth groups? 
A: No.  No.  There was one, and I don't know why, but they were only boys, men, and 
there was a t ennis cl ub which was Zionist .  We went someti mes t o pl ay on their courts, 

but that was a (inaudible).  We belonged to them as friends but we never part of the -- as 

a organization.  Pardon me. 

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
10 
Q: Oka y.  It's 1933 and Hitler has come int o power.  You were only 12, so you were 
young.  Did you -- were you or your parent s aware of situations changing? 

A: I have in m y memory a picture what I will never forget.  My father sitting on the side 

of his bed going t o sleep and on eleven o'clock the evening when t he radio came t hrough 
that Hitler became --  
Q: Chancell or?  

A: -- the chancellor, an d I can hear his voice clearl
y: 
"That's t he end for us."  And that 
memoryis soclear in m y
 mind.  I can see hi m in his underwear.  This is the nightshi rt.  
Clearly, clearly see hi m. 

Q: Did he talk to you about this? 

A: 
He madethisas ast atement to m y mother and meas wewere
 li st ening to the radio.  
Came through and --  
Q: No, but  I meant after that, did he talk to you about Hit ler? Did you talk it over with 

h i m?
 
A: I am sure we were t alking a lot  about him and everythi ng. 

Q: 
Do you 
-- do you remember as a young girl being frightened about  this man Hitler? 
A: Not then.  Not 
--
  
Q: Not at that point? 
A: Not at that early age, but later when I was li stening to his tirades. 
Q: On the radio? 

A: On the radio. 

Q: How did that make you feel? 

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
11 
A: Sick.  Sick in t he st omach.  And we kept wondering, how can these people believe in 
that?  How can the y go with hi m so blindly?  But -- the only thi ng was, you know, that 

we thought that we are so embedded Hungarians that not hing can come to us and nothing 

can hurt us, and awful for all these people who are bothered by it.  But it cannot happen 
to us.   
Q: What languages did you speak?  
A: I started to speak German before I spoke Hungarian because m y father felt that a 

person is as many persons as languages he speaks.  So t he y spoke to me in German only 

until I was five.  Of course I understood i n the meantime Hungarian 
because we had a 

mai d.  We had this coming to the house, that coming to the house, but the y weren't 

talking to me in Hungarian until I was five, so by the ti me I go to school I should be 
really good by chil dren and I should speak that language t oo.   
Q: And your school was taught in Hungarian? 

A: Yes.  Although the second grade we speak 
--
 picked up German and then, of course, in 
gi mnazium we picked up right awa y German as first grade, and the t hird grade French, 

and I had al so private instruction by then in French, and at 16 I started to learn English, 

British English, and in the meanti me I had Latin, too, under -- in everything from fifth  

grade to eighth and we had [???] all three languages -- or four languages:  Hungarian, 
German, French and Latin. 
Q: An ythi ng that you specificall y remember i n the middle '30s that you want to talk 

about, any specific incidents, or di d life just go on --  

A: Our life went on --  

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
12 
Q: -- in a normal sense? 
A: -- except that around us there were already ugly happenings.  

Q: 
Su c
h -- that you were aware of? 
A: Where we were very aware of. 
Q: Such as?  
A: A good friend of our son, who right now li ves in Syracuse and he is now 85, 86, was 

able yet to get to the University i n Debrecen and he ma y have sai d something, I don't 

know 
anymo
re how it started, but a boy who -- whose family turned much earlier, so he 
felt that he is not a Jew, said something of humor, [???] and he gave the guy a slap in hi s     

face.  They threw hi m off from the university.  And his father, who was so proud that hi s 

son was able to make it , got a heart attack on that account and died.  So, yes, that was 
quite close.  And yes, the -- by the time we were 15, 16, and started to go with boys who 
were older t han us and the y couldn't go to the university or the y were in law school, and 

that was a lesser degree school than the other universities were.  The y already had 

problems and the first Jewish laws started t o come in effect in 1938.  It was already ti me 

when a lot of this was 
--
 had to let go from companies because it had to be just a 
percentage of Jews. And from there on it was coming closer and closer. 

Q: How was your father's business affected in 1938? 
A: In '38, not yet. 
Q: 
Mm
-hmm.  
A: But by 1940, '41 it  was affected.  They did not get all the merchandise the y wanted to 

buy.  Not everybody was allowed to sell, and once the war broke out, it was a good 

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
13 
excuse why they are excluding some but why is less merchandise available, so the Jews 
should be getting l ess.  The real problems cam e in 1942 when -- i n 1940, first m y father 

was to go to work camp, but that was a very mi nor and 
--
  
Q: We'll talk about that .  I just want to go a litt le bit chronological ly.   
A: Oka y. 
Q: Were you aware of Kristallnacht? 

A: Most probably, yes, but I cannot now tell you when I 
--
  
Q: Heard about it? 

A: When and how. 

Q: 
Mm
-hmm.   
A: But it was with me.  I knew about it later.  But again, it was something awful 
happening somewhere very far.  The closer t he more vivi d, tragic effects came when 
Hitler came into Vienna and the Viennese Jews, who were original from Hungary, tried 

to come back and came back in droves and were telling us what's happening there and -- 

or so the y couldn't go back. 

Q: And you were 17 years old, so what were your -- do you remember what your -- 
some 

of your thoughts were then? 
A: By then we were very i nvolved and we tried to help t hese people and we made -- 
instead of the winter balls and the musical s and big entertainment s, we started to get 
monies together, help t hem to get the people who did not have a trade to learn a trade so 

they should be able to make it, and we tried to help them.  From there on we were 

actively tryi ng to help t hem. 

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
14 
Q: 
Mm
-hmm.   
A: And there were al ways more and more to be helped.  Plus more and more people were 
taken out to work camps.  First inside Hungary to work, which is -- entailed road building 

and you name everyt hing what was not meant for a Jew to do, and lat er the y took them 
out to go out to Poland and Russia with t he armies and, of course, many, many stayed 
there forever. 

Q: Um, so then the war broke out.  Do you remember that, hearing --  

A: In 1938, September 1st -- 

Q: 1939.   

A: '39.  Excuse me. Sure. '39. I was glued to the radio and listened to Italian news 

because that -- I could get Milano on m y radio and I was t ranslati ng from the Ital ian, 
which was so close to m y Latin, which I knew then very well, t o the family what the rest 
is talking about.  Yes, we were very aware of it, and few da ys later the Polish people      

started to come through.  We had taken in people from t he str
eet.
 
Q: Into your house? 

A: Into the house. 

Q: Did you live in a pri vate house or an apartment? 

A: It was a big apart ment house, but it was a low -- 'cause the wall si de was always a 
huge apart ment and the side was smaller apartments.   
Q: Right in the center of town or on the outskirts? 

A: No, it was not outskirt, but it was not center center.  It was rather a nice area where 

parks were around us. 

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
15 
Q: So you took people --  
A: I like it.  

Q: You took peopl e int o your --  

A: We found a family, a (inaudible) who came with a young boy whom t he y didn't know 
whose chil d he was, only he was a private chil d on the road.  And they picked hi m up and 

it was -- 
they were 
--  the woman wanted to give us some gold items of what she was 
carrying in gratefulness that we let her have a bath and the child and change and wash 

their things.  They had nothing but what t he y had on them.  They were running.  Most of 

them didn't want to stop before Paris.  The y wanted to go at least t hat  far, that smartly, 

but they were coming i n droves.  There were t housands and thousands of people.  And 

the stories what the y had to tell was just plain unbelievabl e.  And there were a few earlier 
who came over from that area, which is out side of the Hungarian border towards the east, 
which was [routine?] land, halfway belonging sometimes to Romania, someti mes to 

Poland, and this was very orthodox Jews, so it was a pocket of very orthodox Jews lived 

there, and they slowly started to come over int o safer place as Hungary was.  At this poi nt 

now the y started to get them toget her who wasn't a citi zen      and were tossing them out  

of the border.  And the stories what we heard that the y are putting them right to death. 

And some girl, she was around 19, saw her family being     killed and she was -- she -- 
she fled because she was so afraid of what -- and realized l ater that she's [laying down?] 
under the bodies and she was able t o come back to tell      all this.  But  again, if you asked 

m y father or anybody i n our [?], that cannot happen to us because we are Hungari ans. We 

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
16 
had put together the cit izenship papers, thi s ki nd of paper, that ki nd of paper.  We were 
almost as proud of being Hungarian than t he Ma yflower Americans. 

Q: So at that point  your father didn't consider i t ti me to leave? 

A: No.  He never di d.  Never consi der leaving.  I wish they did. My mother wanted once 
and not because of that .  He had -- she had absolutely no such bad feelings about  it, but 
then the American [?vertswere?] was in 1938, '36?  I wouldn't know now. 

Q: 
'36.  
 

A: 
Probably '36
.  

Q: 
'36.  
 

A: She wanted to come over.  She wanted to see that because she real l y l iked the idea 

(inaudible) and m y father said, m y wife will be there working there for others.  
[?quona?], what kind of -- never anything happened to it. 
Q: So you were -- whil e this was happening and these refugees are coming in and telli ng 

the stories, you're still at school.  Were you sti ll a student? 

A: Yes.  

Q: Oka y.  And now let's --  

A: But I was not i n school anymore, then I also had to learn a trade because it became --  

Q: When did you finish school? 
A: In 1939. 
Q: 1939.  Okay.  And you had to learn a trade you said?   

A: Because it became clear that even if they -- 
m y parents couldfind 
--
 
and m y mother 
had found -- somebody who was in big job and could bring me i nto t he academ y, they 

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
17 
would kill me in a year because the y would just not let me live t here. They would just 
make me overdo it and my life was in danger if I went there.  So I just had to give up.  

And then --   
Q: Can we go back to 
--
  
A: Oka y.  Sorry. 

Q: Just interested i n 1936 when you realized you couldn't be in the Olympics.  What were 

your thoughts? 

A: Oh, it was a pai n.  It  was a --  

Q: Here you were trained? 

A: I was trained at t hat same year that -- not  the same year. The year before there was a -- 

that club which I belonged to became 150 years old and one of the arch princes came 
f rom -- 
from 
-- (inaudible) came for whom we had to make a big show.  Everybody was 
to get a golden -- 

Q: Medal?  

A: -- medal.  And t he y were sa ying there loud that everybody who participated got a gold 

medal and t hen -- that was early summer and we already went back t o school and there 

was nothing of it.  It turned out that for the Jews the y didn't give the medal.  Jews couldn't 

get it.  So, no, it was a pain.  And yes, it brought the action, of course, and I didn't want to 
participate anymore i n any of the game, but because I was a good friend with this teacher 
who was our coach, I st ill did and I still did everything mature, but the feeling wasn't in 

there anymore. 

Q: Um, okay.  Let 's jump ahead back to 1940, I guess we were.  

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
18 
A: Well, just to finish t hat thought.  For 40 ye ars I didn't do any sports.  I just couldn't 
bring m yself to, so I became a couch potato in that sense.  It was a reaction.   

Q: You were talking about 1939, 1940, and hearing these stories and t he refugees coming 

in, and then you st arted to learn a trade.  
What did you 
-- what trade was that? 
A: It was --  the trade was fitting into our future.  The Œ 
my
 first husband's family, as I 
mentioned, he was in (i naudible) shirt business, so I learned how t o make custom- made 

shirts, pajamas, elegant  underwear for men, and I went through that so if --  

Q: Did you go to a trai ning school? 

A: No.  There was a school, but beside the school you had to go for one year into a shop 

to learn the trade and you had to --  
Q: Had you gone t o the school first? 
A: No.  During the year when you went to the shop, every second afternoon I had to go 
for two hours to the school too, but that was it . 

Q: 
Mm
-hmm.   
A: Not even serious thing.  It was just telling you what a worker is expected to do. 
Q: 
Mm
-hmm.  And you're still living at home at this point? 
A: Oh, yes.  And m y fi rst husband, we were i n love.  I think I was 16-and-a-half when I 

met  h i m.
 
Q: How did you meet him?  

A: In the first ball that I was introduced, after midnight, the midnight dance, five young 

men came over, were i ntroduced by one of them who knew me, and out of the five, two 

became m y husband.
 

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
19 
Q: Oh, m y.  Oh, my.  Um, so you were worki ng and living at home? 
A: Yeah.  

Q: And then what was the next change or --  

A: I got married. 
Q: Oh, when was t hat? 
A: First of all, the first change that might i nterest you was 1940 when m y father was 

taken to this work camp I mentioned to you. 

Q: 
Mm
-hmm.   
A: Which was only for a summer l ong, and the C.O. was m y Lati n and history teacher, 

who was really very ni ce gentleman and was suffering from this i dea that he has t o be 

now bossi ng this all Jews.  These men were al ready in the late fifties. What the y were 
there for, it was not for work.  They were just there to be killed and the put-down, the 
shame on t hem. Nothing else.  (Pause.)   
(Tape one, side two.) 
Q: Tape one, side t wo.  And you were talki ng about how your father had to go off in the 

summerti me to a labor camp. What was your t houghts about seei ng your father having to 

go away, to be taken away? 

A: We kept going with him.  It was some 60 miles from where we lived. 
Q: You went with hi m? 
A: And every da y we t axied out t here to be wi th him.  We didn't let t hem go.  We didn't 

let them be alone.  But you have to live as then we were still very much in charge of what 

we wanted t o do.  

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
20 
Q: This is summer of 1940? 
A: 1940.  Yes. 

Q: Did you have contact with him when you got there? 

A: Yes.  
Q: You could talk to him? 
A: 
Oh, yes.
 
Q: What ki nd of work did he do?  

A: Practically nothi ng.  It was just  to sit around in a dusty place, t o st and up and sta y at 

the (inaudib le) -- and si t --they were really j ust annoying t he people and didn't let them 

do what the y wanted to do, the y supposed to do in their own businesses.  Just pulled out.   

Q: What happened t o your father's business while he was awa y? 
A: Well, we tried to keep it accordi ng to their orders moving on.  They have plenty of 
good and dependable employees t o run it, and it didn't last long.  It was some six weeks I      

(inaudible) told you about, but it was something what you don't forget 'cause the little 

peasant man who's now -- God knows what kind of rank he has.  He is so old.  He doesn't 

know what  to -- who these people are.  He only knows t hat I am now in charge to tell 

them that now it 's ti me to go to sleep and now to wake up and now make your bed and 

things what the y haven't done already for last 30 years or so. 
Q: What was the name of the location of the labor camp?  
A: 
Hatvan, H
-A-T- V- A-N.  

Q: And did you bring him anything when you would go visit?  Did you bring food or --  

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
21 
A: Most of the ti me we still went there to restaurants, we were able to get here.  We could 
order people  to bring when we come next da y this kind of food, fruit, whatever th
e y 

needed.  It was rather easy to take care of them there.  

Q: And then he came back? 
A: Yeah.  
Q: And resumed hi s work? 

A: Sure.  

Q: And you were, um, still living, you said, at home? 

A: Yes.  I l ived home until I got married, t hen actually even after that because --  

Q: When did you get married? 

A: 1942.  
Q: Oh, 1942? 
A: March of 1942. 

Q: Anythi ng else i n 1940?  Any more restricti ons that you felt? Were you restricted? 

A: We were already restricted.  If -- I couldn't go to the university.  If I had to work now 

as -- near what the sewing machine, that was not what I was made up for, made for. 

Q: Yeah.  Any restrictions on hours, being out side? 

A: No, not --  
Q: Not at that point? 
A: No, not that yet .  You see, the war did not start seriously while the Germans went 

ahead.  The problems 
--
  
Q: Hungary was an ally of the Germans? 

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
22 
A: Yes.  But then the y were coming back after Stalingrad. That 's where the war came 
(inaudible) us.
 
Q: So now 1940 went on after your father came back and you were working 19 --  

A: I think another Jewi sh law came which made things a little bi t more insecure, but 
again, this 
--
 all these was not affecting me, t he girl, in that comfy home.  And having m y      
husband then, we were very opti mist.  Very, very optimi st.  
Q: 
And your
 husband's name? 

A: Paul Barkovich (sp). 

Q: Paul Barkovich.  Okay.  And now it 's 1941.  Things are going on as the y were.  In 

1942 you said yougot married?
 
A: Yes.  
Q: Did your life change?  You said you st a yed living at home?  
A: Well, we sta yed livi ng at 
home because 
-- because of the war.  There were no more 

buildings going on, so t here was no apart ment available.  And my in-laws gave us a lot 

on which the two boys -- the y had two sons -- should bui ld for themself modern homes as 

the war comes to an end, and again it's a possibility which we could comfortably wait out 

in my
 parents' house.  And we lived there together with t hem. 
Q: 
Mm
-hmm.  
A: But six weeks after my wedding they took my father out now, and now the y t ook all 

these -- all the men 
--
 not only all the men, all the professional people and the business Œ 
the better business people.  The ranked business, because we are ranking everythi ng.  

There's a la yer up there and another layer and a third layer.  So not the -- not to 

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
23 
(inaudible) to camp.  (Inaudible) state.  The bosses went t o camp, but now they were 
taking them out to [?] and they did not come back for another 16 months.  After 16 

months, we were able to pull enough strings to bring the older ones together.  My father 

was the 58 and close to 60.  What do the y want to do to t hese men?  And then --  
Q: Did you have any, um, communication with your father while he was awa y during 

those 16 months? 

A: Yes.  These -- these Hungarian peasants who were now over them, who were giving 

rank and the y were -- how should I put it  -- put in charge over them kept coming back 

home for a visit to the officer's house.  The officers should -- and each ti me we were able 

to bribe them to bri ng letters and to bring them l etters and also some food and some 

clothing when winter came.  I mean, when they went away it was June.  They call ed them 
in in Ma y, and I think by June 10th the y were not in the country.  And some of them, the 
younger professionals i n one group, were sent straight to 
--
 oh, God.  Now you better stop 
that machine because 
--
 so these young professionals were [?state?] sent on minefields      
instead of [dogsaur]. 

Q: Do you remember where your father -- do you know where your father was taken 

specificall y? 

A: Yes, he was in barmitzva (inaudible) in the Ukraine. 
Q: And, um, that was for 16 mont hs you said?  So what did you and your mother do, and 
your husband? 

A: We tried to run the business and, of course, these ladies never had any word i n the 

business, so whatever t hey did and whatever 
--
 the wa y the y had seen life, because you 

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
24 
could not --  and these 
--
 our three old men would never have thought of holding back 
merchandise, not to sel l it, to keep the mone y's value, and, of course, the ladies were 
happily selling out everything and then when they couldn't get  merchandise for it, then 

m y mother's brother came down, who was the lawyer, anywa y lived i n Budapest, and 
they made a deal wit h hi m that he's buying a condomini um apart ment in Budapest on that 
money so the value.  When the old men came home and heard about t hat, the y were, how 

can you do such a thing?  They ruin the business.  The y were running four stores.  
My 

parents' business was such that the y were t he first chain st ore in t his li ne.  They had 

stores in three different cities in the -- in Hungary too.  So the y j ust couldn't believe that 

what the -- what these women are t hinking, and, of course, the y -- the
y werenot how 
-- 
the y were too honest, t oo straight to know how -- how t o live during war time.  
Q: You -- you had enough food and -- 
A: Yes.  
Q: -- your health was good -- 

A: Yes.  

Q: -- at this ti me? 

A: We were able to do everything.  
Q: And your husband was still with you? 
A: Yes.  

Q: Oka y.   

A: Yes.  

Q: And then the next change? 

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
25 
A: 1944.  
Q: Well, oka y.  Then your father came back? 

A: 
Oh, yes.
 
Q: Right.  And he --  
A: The y took over and the y just li ved their life the wa y that they meant to supposed to do. 
Q: And you stayed wit h your husband wi th your parents? 

A: Yes.  

Q: And your husband worked in his father's business? 

A: Yes, and I was t here with hi m. 

Q: Right.  And were you also now getting reports from what was happening in ot her parts 

of Europe, 1942, '43? 
A: Sure.  Sure.  Except that, you know, but you're talking about getting news or what 's 
happening somewhere.  Yes, you hear about everything, but hist ory is being painted      

differentl y by different people.  If you pick up two history books, the y will not see the 

same thing.  And so we did not get only what t he Germans allowed to get and the 

Hungarians allowed to get, except when I was -- as told you, when you listen to Free 

Europe, you practically play with your freedom because if they cat ch you on it, then the y 

jail you, but that was the only wa y to try t o get  some information, and that information 
was not true information either.  That was propagandA:  So we --  we pedaled through 
that.   

Q: How was your father's health when he came back from 16 month
s?  
 

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
26 
A: Well, he was a sick man since 1920.  When he came back from Russian POW camp, 
he was not a healthy m an anymore and he didn't become healthier during that ti me, 

except it helped hi m that he lost a lot of weight.  He was a overweight  man before and 

definitely in that sense it was a good wa y of losing weight.  Well, he was not a healthy 
man and he did not  act healthier.  But he was able to work. 
Q: Now comes 1944.  

A: Now comes 1944, and 1944 was quite a year.  What I didn't tell you, that very soon 

after I got married I became pregnant, and m y husband, rest in peace, was so smart.  He 

said, we have plenty of ti me.  We are so young.  I don't want you to have a child and 

leave it here and I bei ng taken out.  I don't want to leave a war wi dow and this child goes.   

So my father's peasant soldier who was coming back from the front was asked by m y 
father to see us all, that he wants hi m to bring picture of all of us, not picture pict ure, but     
that he spoke to us, each and every one of us.  So because I was in bed, they had to bring 

hi m up to m y house, and my father kept asking enough questions from that man t hat what      

the man didn't know why I'm i n that bed.  He figured out and wrote us back awful letter, 

what did I dare to do.  Anyway, I just wanted to tell you that we went  through that, too.      

My husband has a sixth sense that t his is not the time. Then while my father was still out 

there, the Italians had stepped out of the war, and that brought to us hope that now they're 
falling apart and now we don't have t o hold out too much longer.  Still nobody, so -- and 
nobody could i magine that the Germans comi ng, and even if they coming that t he y can 

do anything to us.  So when the y came in on March 19th and the y arrived, we were very 

organized.  The y organized the Jewish leaders of the cit y to give t hem names. They 

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
27 
organized the Jewish (inaudible) to tell them that there's nothing to worry about and the y 
are having guarantees that we just give the Germans every half and nobody will bother 

us.  And t hen they needed apart ment s and we were put into the ghett o, and in the ghetto a 

officer of the army who was in charge of this work camps came i nto the ghetto and pulled 
all these men out hoping that if he puts them in the camp that we're safe then.  And he 
knew that t he best will be taken out from the country and he hoped that with these he 

saves them the y can stay in the country, and he did.  He did it quite wrong from Ma y to 

December when [sourshit] took over, and then when in B udapest they found the last ones 

and pulled them altogether, he helped them to safe places. 

Q: When was the ghett o formed in your ci ty? 
A: In Ma y. 
Q: In Ma y.  And, um, what -- what was your first impressions when you saw the 
Germans?  Do you remember that? 

A: Tragedy, tragedy, tragedy.  We were very, very scared.  But again, the scariness of it 

was that the y are there.  The scariness of it was that the y can do harm to people, that they 

can 
-- there.  (Inaudible) there.  But that the y can't take out somebody from the country 

but still di d not.  

Q: 
Mm
-hmm.   
A: Just di d not come to possibilities.  Not the very latest from the cit y ghetto, from where 

m y mother, my father, and m y husband was taken out now.  Mostly women stayed 

behind were taken out now to a outside-of-the -city ghetto, which was a brick factory, and 

in that brick factory they not only made us wai t, but the y pulled al together from t he 

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
28 
whole are
a.
  So some 60,000 Jews were taken out from Miskolc from that brick factory to 
Auschwitz.  
Q: Um, yeah.  So how l ong were you in the -- the first ghetto in the beginning? 

A: Almost  two months. 
Q: 
Two months?
 
A: No, no, no, that  was less.  Probably just about five weeks, but during that time the 
gendarmerie was beat ing all of the Jews, the secrets where the y had put their monies and 

the --  

Q: Valuables? 

A: And that was everyday affair that they did not come out alive from t here, and some 

who knew that the y could not handle that killed themself before going in there. 
Q: Was your family questioned at all? 
A: No, and that was strange, because somebody from that office, which was right across, 
as we kept hearing t he screaming from there, came over and m y father became so scared 

that he got the diarrhea and was si tting in an outhouse, and the y went  by and pulled the 

people from the next t wo buildings. Nice memories.  

Q: What was the condition like in the ghetto?  Was it near 
--
was the ghetto near where 
you had lived? 
A: The first ghetto in t he city was that very, very just Jewish area, so my father had a 
friend who had a house nearby that some ei ght  families went to li ve with that family. 

Q: What di d you take with you?  You were a young, young woman. 

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
29 
A: I don't know.  Lot of things from grits to coats to summer wear to -- it was spring, so 
you needed sweaters, summer wear.  You name it, we were taking it.  Then somebody    

came in there and said that you cannot use that here. There's no room here.  Give it to me.  

I -- trust me, I keep it for you.  Which, of course, the y didn't, but the y took it from our 
hand not to have our hand over strength used. The -- these people who had to live there 
together, that means that two, three family in one room of the apartment, one corner, this 

family live on this matt ress.  That family li ve 
--
 it was not  fun.  
Q: There were four of you, your parents and you and your husband?  

A: Yes, at t he begi nning, but that was very short time because I said the two men had 

been taken out but t he other famili es' men went too then, and probabl y another week or 

so we lived there with l ess people, but agai n, with jittery nerves because the one 
bathroom really couldn't take care of all of us comfortabl y. 
Q: Did you go out on t he street? 

A: Yes, inside there, in the ghetto, but out side of the ghetto you didn't go there and 

(inaudible).  I went wit h m y husband from thi s first ghetto to agricult ural work.  The city 

had a gardening establishment and we were given them to garden there and --  
Q: What ki nd of work?  You did gardening work? 
A: Yeah.  Sometimes we were -- someti mes we were to pick flowers in the flower 
area, 
and during the ti me when I was in one of the parks where we were supposed to work but 
we never got to it, t he American came with a (inaudible) from one end of the city to the 

other and we were the one which t he y bombed.  The y mi ssed the -- t he train stat ion and 

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
30 
they missed the -- what  establishment was that ?  It was something what was for the arm y.  
Some big building.  So the y missed that, t oo, but the y --  

Q: Headquarters or somet hing? 

A: -- but they had gotten us, and one of the young girls from our group was pulled 
different little pieces.  But again, there I (i naudible) my husband wasn't there.  Then I was 
out of the alarm and we were turni ng the dirt, he was still with us.  That wasn't near to the 

station, the train station. 

Q: So then the men left your ghett o and you and your mother were there and then you -- 

the two of you were taken?  

A: And then we went t o that brick factory. 

Q: The brick factory? 
A: The y took us on the morning on June 6th when the Normandy 
--
  
Q: Oh, the D-Day.  Yes, the Normandy invasion.   
A: And so the people yelled in that you don't have to hold out too much longer.  The 

Americans are staying.  But we didn't have the ti me.  Now, many people were able to 

escape from there, and earlier from that --  

Q: From t he --  

A: -- city ghetto, even from brick factory, and when I first mentioned it to m y father, 
actually we were in our apart ment yet because the first question came up.  People were 
turning Catholic in big numbers.  

Q: Jews were turni ng Catholi
c?
 

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
31 
A: Because they hoped that if they are changing them the y will be saved from worst to a 
lesser bad.  And then my father, my mother turned to us and said that we don't mind if 

you do it, if you feel li ke doing it , and my husband and I said no. We don't do this.  But 

m y father's part ner, hi mself and his daughter and son-in-law, all changed with no help.  
Of course none came back.  But that was t he first step.  Then we were asking my father if 
we should not try to go up to Budapest, and he said, how can I?  Who is here on t he train 
  

who doesn't know me?  Who is there who doesn't know your mother?  How would a Œ 

ide
a.
  This idea came back just before they took us to the brick factory.  We got a note    
from m y uncle from Budapest that  he can send somebody for us who could take us to 

them and we shall consider going, and m y mot her said, I'm not going to go nowhere.  If 

your father cannot com e, then how can I go?  No, we don't go.  So we sta yed.  That's how 
we wound up in Auschwitz.  
Q: How far was the bri ck factory from the ghetto? 

A: Oh, about eight, ten miles. 

Q: And how did you get there? 

A: Walked. 

Q: You walked? 

A: Walked t hrough the cit y.  Walked through the city. 
Q: And did the Hungarians look at you, or were the citizens looking --  

A: Some very happily, some less happily.  As I said, some yelled in that it won't take too 

long and don't worry, but others, well, quite happy.  

Q: And what -- 

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
32 
A: The Hungarians hate Jews, you know.  Just  about as bad as the Poles who haven't seen 
a Jew, but t he y hate them. 

Q: Um, and what did you take with you onto t he brick factory now?  What did you have 

with you?
 
A: Only as much as you were able t o carry, so there is already some pasta, some dried 

pasta, because what are we going to eat?  Potat o we find somewhere and we put a little 

pasta in it and we make soup and we live on it.  Very little else. 

Q: Yeah.  Did you have any valuables 
wit h you?
 

A: The valuables were taken off us before we went.  In that city ghett o the y took the last 

ones off us. 

Q: Did you take anyt hing very personal wi th you, senti mental val ue? 
A: I don't know.  I really don't know. 
Q: Photographs or anyt hing? 

A: I don't know.  I don't think so.  

Q: So how did your mother manage walking to the ghetto? 

A: Well, she was a young woman.  She was healthier and better looki ng than I was ever 

and -- but when we arri ved to Auschwitz where we unpacked, she sai d, we don't surviv
e 

this one.  I said oh, yes, mom, we will.  She sai d that well.  
Q: So now you're in t he brick factory.  What were the conditions like there? 
A: It was plain awful.  It was just you sit  in the dust.  The brick stands there to dry.  That 

makes you have wal ls, and above it it's empty and the air flies through and the flies fly 

through and God knows what smells fly through.  Here you are already in bi
g, big 

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
33 
groups, and m y second husband's first wife and child was there.  The baby was t hen 
about 16 months old and heavy.  So he survived someti mes with caring (inaudible) and 

the mother
-in-law picked him up, then the other sister-in-law helped, we went over to 

help.  And it was no life anymore.  But I still had cigarettes in there. 
Q: Were people -- what was the feeling about of the people then, the Jews in the brick 
factory? 

A: Scared.  And the ones who had more -- more smell -- smell than t hey gave somebo
dy 

something what the y still had wit h value and l eft.  And left us there.  It was awful stupid -

- how should I put it to you?  It is possibl e thing not to try to escape because what worse 

can happen t o you?  They grab you and put you on other end. 

Q: 
Did y
ou know that? 
A: No.  No.   

Q: Did you consider tryi ng to escape? 

A: I asked m y mother.  I found a [ shawndar?] who would have helped and she said, what 

will your mother 
--  your father say?  Your father said that we cannot go, and so we sta y -- 
we sta y together. 

Q: So you were there with your mother for how long in the brick factory? 

A: About six to eight days only. 
Q: Six to eight days.  Yeah.   
A: June 6th we went, and on June 12th t he y packed us, so exactly six da ys.  

Q: What was June 12th like?  How did you know that you would be moving? 

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
34 
A: The y were coming i n [shawndars?] and pushing us int o one directi on and we were at 
the train.  

Q: To a train station? 

A: It was not a trai n station.  It was the trai n which could come in into the brick factory. 
Q: Into the brick factory.  I see.   
A: It was nothing serious.  We went then together in it, then the y pushed it out to the 

regular station. 

Q: Yeah.  And what ki nd of a train was it? 

A: There was only one kind of train there.  

Q: It was t he cattle car train?  

A: Yes, (inaudible).  Yes. 
Q: And, um --  
A: By the t ime we got to the railroad station we were already thirsty and were begging 

for water, and the friends of ours sister and her family were in that  same (inaudible) who 

was -- who had diabetes and we had seen her without food there going through all the 

worstwa y youcan see somebody slowly dying.
 

Q: Did you know many other people in the Œ  

A: (No audible response.) 
Q: Was thi s mostly -- t his was women, mostly women?  
A: Mostly women, because a lot of men were taken, but really it was not a special train 
for women only and men only were separated. 

Q: Right.   

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
35 
End of File One 
Beginning File Two 
Q: This is tape two side A. And you were talking about how you and your mother were 
leaving the brick factory and had gotten on the train with other people that you knew. 
How long did the train trip take?   
A: Over two days. It was a very long trip.  

Q: Did you know where you were going?   

A: No. We were sure we are probably going to the other side, western side of Hungary. 

That's where we are going to work. Then when they took us through the border, i t must 

be here somewhere i n Germany the y will need us on the west. Again thought went west, 

never thought of going toward east now. And t here was the train st opped and we were at 
Zakopane. Did you hear that name? That was t he Czech Al ps most beautiful ski area 
where you only wanted to go in styl e. That was a luxury to go to Zakopane. I looked up 

at m y mot her and I sai d we come back here once on our own. 

Q: What were the conditions like in the train?  

A: That was somet hing that you cannot ____. It was just plain awful. 120 people in that 

train in the summer. With the one 
--
 what do t hey call that  ____?  What was for 
everybody to -- 
Q: Bucket?  
A: Bucket.  

Q: Were you able to sit  down and rest or?  

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
36 
A: We were constantly sitting in a corner at  the very end of the trai n against the wall 
pulling our legs in because there was no room for that. You couldn't t ake somebody else's 

room up. 

Q: Were people helping each other? What was the -- 
A: I don't think so. I thi nk that probably you could only sa y that they were trying to suffer 
as quietly as possi ble not to bother the next one. I don't think that there was anything we 

could really help each other with. The most was that if somebody stil l probably had some 

water from somewhere and somebody was so sick that the y were yell ing and screaming 

for somethi ng then probably they were able to wash his face probably. More than that 

there was not a chance to do for anybody anyt hing. 

Q: Were there any chil dren in the car?  
A: Plenty. Plenty. From t iny little ones to teenagers or every kind. Every age group what  
you can i magine just haphazardly thrown t ogether.  

Q: Were you always next to your mother?   

A: Yes. We were next to each other all our lives. She was my best friend. I didn't need 

girlfriends or such because she was everything for me. She was young and beautiful and 

understandi ng and full with interest. 

Q: Did she support you at the time that you became pregnant -- 
A: Oh yes. Very much -- 
Q: And needed to t ermi nate the pregnanc y?   

A: Oh yes. She was with me all the wa y, every step of it. Oh yes. 

Q: Was that  a difficult -- just to go back t o that time for a moment , was that a difficult -- 

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
37 
A: Decision -- 
Q: Procedure to have done to terminate your pregnanc y. Were you able to get a doctor? 

A: Well, yes. There was only one non-Jewish doctor anymore in t own who was ready and 

willing to have Jewish women to get rid of their pregnancies. All t he Jewish 
gynecologi sts were already out in Russia or Poland, or the y didn't live anymore. And so 
one friend of mine who needed this kind of help was givi ng me t he word that this was t he 

man to turn to. And yes he was very decent and willing. That it did not work out so well 

that that was m y private --  

Q: You had complications? 

A: Yeah, that was bad luck. 

Q: But you got good care? 
A: Yes. My mother was taking care of everyt hing. She was there and she was wi th me. 
Q: Do you recall anythi ng special t hat your mother said to you when you were going -- 

leaving in the train car? Anything special?   

A: Nothing on the train. I only remember cl earl y when we arrived t o Auschwitz and they 

were unpacking us t hat she said we won't survive that one.  

Q: What was the arrival like? 

A: The y were throwing you out. First you the person and then the packages came after. 
That would stay to the Canada. But we di dn't know that and -- 
Q: Did you know where you were?   

A: No. We had no i dea what that is. We just read the -- 

Q: Sign -- 

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
38 
A: We knew that this is going to be a work camp because it said "arbeit macht frei".  
Q: Right.   

A: But as I said, my mother fell on the right si de behind -- now again I can't remember 

the most easiest word. They were people who looked like the y were crazy. We thought 
that probably these are moved over to that side, they are wearing this uniform --  
Q: This is right after you got off the train? 

A: Yeah. Right across us as we were on this -- 

Q: The platform -- 

A: On the other side of the rail. These peopl e were yelling and screaming that t o m y 

mother that  you should put a scarf on your head. I don't understand that the y tell you to 

put -- I wouldn't be crazy enough 
--
 it's hot enough in thi s coat because she was wearing a 
heavy coat. Her hair here up front started t o gray. She had that litt le gray on there. And 

they knew what they were telling us. We just didn't understand. And then they made us 

standing in line of five. So we stood in line of five. We saw that the men were put 

separately. We had no men in our group. None of us. It was m y mothers two -- 
m y 
father's partners' wives. The two women and the young married daughter of one of the 

partners. The one who turned Chri stian earlier. We were the five in that row. This mother 

who I ment ioned to you that she was with them i n that row she was a petite person, very 
tiny. Very elegant li ttle lady. But she was so small that they looked upon her as a child so 
she went with the grown ups right awa y to the left side. I was the only one who was 

thrown to the living side. 

Q: And then where did you go after that?  

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
39 
A: The y took us i nto a building which and into a large area inside which had very 
interesting furnishi ng. It was just low ____ nothing else. And we were told to put down 

decently our clothing to the place so we can find it and everything is to come off. And 

then we were taken t o t he next room and t he y were getting into our hair and the hair 
under our underarms --  
Q: Your body -- 

A: And the body hair from everywhere. And they did not do too l uxuri ous job on it and 

someti mes your body went with the skin and all. But the y said -- 

Q: Who did that to you, men or wo
men ? 
 
A: These were women. These were the Slovak girls who were still survived. See by then 

there were very few of them who survived still. The y were there for three years. And 
these were practically all animals already because they were ready t o kill each other, their 
own mother for surviving. And the y were telli ng you why they were cutting your hair, 

where your mother went, what 's happening just right now on the other side.   

Q: Did you believe her?  

A: Not only I believed her, I started to cry and I didn't  stop crying for three da ys. I didn't 

have anymore moist to it and I didn't have anymore tears running. It was a dry, hoarse cry 

which I could not stop for three days. It was at that point when we all realized how stupid 
we were. Where we came. And the y were telli ng us that we are the lucky ones which we 
came so late that we wi ll survive t hat. Not  like their families. And how good that they 

had taken our body hai r off because now the y are going to use a powder on it and so we 

will not get lice. Which is very i mportant. Let me assure you, yes it's very i mport ant not 

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
40 
to get lice. Because the ones who got lice got ____ and t he y were gone. They were the 
goners first because there was no way there to keep clean. 

Q: Were you able to say anything to your mother when she went i n t he other direction?   

A: Not a thing. And this is what kills me to thi s da y, back 50 years. Not that I di dn't t ell 
her anything, that I did not get in argument  to Mengele. I spoke Germ
an. Whydi dn't I 
start telling him that she's as young as I am and let her come with me. What would 

happen to me? But I didn't give it a try. And I'm living with that  for over 50 years and 

cannot forgive m yself. I came home, my father's first word was what did you do to your 

mother. And I was telling hi m just like I t old you now. And I was telli ng this a few times 

later and everybody was telling me stop sa ying that because -- and no I can't st op this 

because nobody can feel what I feel and nobody knows how I can see the situation that 
yes I could have given it a try. I have to live with that. And it's not easy to live with that. 
And whatever life had for me what  was bad I deserved because of that, I think. She was 

not just a mother, she was somebody wonderful. And not even t o try to save her. It's more 

than one can survive. And so we came out from that area and the y t ook us for a shower. 

And on the other end we were comi ng out and the y were throwing toward us litt le 

packages.  Instead of our clothing this was now become our clothing. So what I received 

was probably for a ten-
year
-old girl. It was that long. My private body was showing and 
there was no panties gi ven. That was that. I was given a shirt and this dress and t hat was 

that. Luckily for me I was carrying m y shoe because I am very sensitive, I cannot step 

down with -- 
soI wascarryi ng m y shoes.
 
Q: Your own shoes?  

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
41 
A: My own shoes. And that survived with me all the wa y until we left Auschwitz. I 
carried it everywhere. 

Q: Just to get back, how did you know it  was Mengele that was at  the station?  

A: I didn't know he was the one. But there was that man in that uniform and he was 
showing t his wa y and t hat wa y. And the peopl e were carryi ng the people out. Then later 
when he was coming to our camp then we knew names and -- 
Q: But at t hat point -- 

A: It became very elegant. Oh, we knew everyt hing.  

Q: So then you got your short dress and you had your own shoes and where did they take 

you? Where did you go then?   

A: That's when we went to our camp. It was B -3, barrack five. Which was the outer shell 
of a barrack really, not hing more. It had t wo big doors on the two ends and on the side it 
had windows without glass. And t here was not hing in it. We did not get the elegance like 

shifts on which you sleep five in an area and you are above ____. No we didn't have 

anyt hing. We just wrap them --  

Q: On the ground?  

A: On the ground. They t ook us i n rows of five and the y said these ____ to the right these 

____ to the left. So when you la y down you will be like forks. One body this way, one 
body that way. So my legs went in between the legs of the other person and that kept me 
warm. And my arm became my pillow together with m y shoe and when you wanted to go 

out to the l atrine then you try to go through these bodies who were completely next to 

each other. And in t he dark when you wanted to make it t o the wi ndow so you can go 

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
42 
through it, step through it in the shortest way out then you stepped on somebody's face, 
on somebody's arm, on somebody's legs. Som ebody was screaming here and either you 

had time to get out in ti me or you didn't. And you gave them all t he beauties of what your 

body was relieving. If there ever was somet hing what take to cure humanity awa y from 
you where you felt so bad that you thought any animal is l ivin
ga much more 
-- I can't 
even think of -- but every l ife, every ani mal can have more decenc y and more respect, 
self -respect than you can. What are you? What kind of ani mal are you who you would do 

that to your neighbor? These were the nights t here. If it rained out side, it rained inside. It  

only had not ceiling, nothing above us just it kept coming in. And for hours after it 

stopped rai ning outside it was stil l coming down and you were si tting in it la ying in it in 

that wetness. There was nothing. Nothing, no chance, no one to turn t o. At the other hand, 
at the one end of the barrack there was a little room in which the blockalteste where the 
two stubendiest lived. And they had all the quilts there dry. I don't know how dry but 

definitely they alwa ys found something dry for themselves. We di dn't have that ki nd of 

chances to own something what would keep us warm or dry or whatever. And that's 

where we li ved for six weeks. 

Q: What di d you do during the day?   

A: Standing in Appell or la ying on the floor, on the ground. A ground which was 
completely naked, not even a speck of grass or anything on that. And on one end there 
was some water coming up standi ng there together. Ugly, dirty water.  That's what you 

drunk if you wanted to drink, no matter the y told you not to drink it. That's what you 

washed your clothi ng in or yourself in. And some people just refused to. So they became 

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
43 
sick fast. Not well fast. I tell you honestly I wouldn't have cared and did anythi ng for 
m yself either. When we got to Auschwitz I met a girl who was worki ng in my mother-
in
-
law's house for the last year and a half. She was an escapee from that area from ____ 

where I mentioned t o you. Three daughters the parents threw into Hungary that they 
should save themselves. And they worked as mai ds in Jewish houses where somebody 
was ready and willing t o give a Jewish girl the dirty work. My mother couldn't do it. She 

would not. She would not have a Jewish woman working for her. No way. But m y 

mother-in-law had such a girl and she I met there in this camp and she started to look 

after me. She pushed me to go to wash. She took my clot hes off to wash it because I was 

just sitting there compl etely letting go. And she didn't. And she was t here for about four, 

five weeks. And during this ti me 
--
  
Q: What was her name?  

A: Monsi Margaret  Jacobowich(ph). She offered, volunteered to go for the food. You had 

to go over t o another camp for that. The y were such wonderful chaps taking out the sick 

people from the barracks, throw them on the carriage which was taki ng them to the ____. 

So she offered herself that she goes for food and carries the food cans back to ours. And 

during this ti me she was looking around and yelling to people if the y knew somebody 

from her family. She was looking for them. And sure enough in the C Camp she found 
two of her younger sist ers. And then she t old me that she wants to go over to them if I 
take care of m yself, and there was some woman who wanted to come over to thi s camp 

she will be changing place with her and then the number will be all ri ght and that will 

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
44 
come back. So unti l then I was with her and I t hink that saved m y life because I would 
not have done anyt hing for myself during these weeks. 

Q: What were the Appells like? 

A: Appells were -- i t was dark when we went out and stood there for three, four, five 
hours until  the y counted and counted and recounted. And if they missed somebody at one 
block then the whole 14 or 17 blocks would be held there i n this camp and all standing 

there. So three, four hours mini mum after whi ch the y gave the breakfast. And then you 

were told to go and eit her you were back to the barrack which usuall y they threw you out 

from and so you had to go some place around. And then t he y called you again to Appell 

to have the dinner -- the lunch and then the same ti me the y were handing out bread whi ch 

was the dinner. So for t hat you were again for three or four hours and then the y counted. 
The y counted. 
Q: Do you know how many peopl e they were counting?   

A: How many people were the y counting where? 

Q: In the Appell.  

A: All of them. Al l of them. See, in one barrack was about 500 people. If somebody was 

so sick they went over to the revere, which was the hospi tal, and the y didn't find her or 

God knows where they stood in line in the other part then you were st anding until the y 
found her. 
Q: Did you have to do any work?   

A: No. There was no work -- 

Q: No work there -- 

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
45 
A: This was a Vernichtungslager. You know t hat much German? No? Vernichtungslager 
is where they want you to disappear. You were going to be killed slowly with not eating, 

with not having drinking water. You will die out. This camp was when the y needed 

workers somewhere thi s is where they came to get them together from and this is how 
one escaped from there. And duri ng the times where while we were there there were 
other people who worked and mostly men who were crossing our camp going from work 

to camp or t he other way around. And during that ti me of course you kept yelling and 

calling out names so I was calling m y husband's name out, his brother's name ou
t, m y 

father-in-law's, m y father's name. And t hen a l ittle paper came someti mes was thrown 

over to me by somebody who said no the y are not here but Andrew Freed is here, who 

became my second husband. And he was l ooking for of course all of his family. And then 
m y father-in-law's store manager was there. Sent me a message that he's there. But our 
folks were not there. They were gone straight -- m y father-in-
law, mother
-in-
law. The 

men were not there. They did not get there yet. Rather didn't get there period 
because 

they did not go to Auschwitz. So I was there until August 2nd and the last week of that 

was when they kill ed the gypsy camp. We were standing outside on Appell and the sky 

was yellow and red and the screami ng was just  unbelievable. The y were throwing them 

as people tell us living into the fire. And then came the morning when Mengele and some 
three other officers came to and stopped at every block, barrack and pulled out certain 
people to work and the other one was left behi nd. So I was very l ight body all my life. I 

was very thin. So sure enough the first thi ng was that I was left behind. Everybody from 

m y line, my first cousin and m y aunt and m y first cousin's t wo sister-in-laws, a younger 

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
46 
one and a grown up, were in my line. The y all  went to work and I was sta ying behind. So 
I got back i nto m y dress ran over to another barrack --  

Q: The y had made you take off your clothes?  

A: Yeah. You walked completely naked. You hold your clothing up there somewhere and 
you walk with your arms up so t he y can take a good look at you breast and all. 
Q: How did you feel by that point?  

A: Like ani mals. Not humans. That's so dehumanizing. You know, by t he time you got 

there it doesn't even hurt anymore. But what hurts, the knowledge that you're left here 

behind and you know what that means. So if you still have some energy to live that life 

then you go on and try to get into the next barrack and stand in the line there with that 

people. So while they were in the middle barrack I got to the next  barrack and I got 
undressed with the rest of them and stood in the line and again the y put me out. So it 
wasn't funny. No, I didn't bother even dressing too much. I ran over t o the next barrack. 

And when the y pick my arm that it's not enough and then I put m y m uscle that I have this 

side. By then my barrack was wa y outside, outside of the gates. How do I go to t hem? So 

there was only one wa y. The big avenue of the camp which had the -- 

Q: Gate?   

A: No. The soldier with the --  
Q: The guard?  
A: Yeah, but this guard had something wi th -- I'm looking this way but I cannot 

remember. Stop it please. So on t he main avenue of the camp there was this soldier with 

the machine gun and I figured there's only two ways. Eit her I sta y here or he shoots me. I 

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
47 
haven't got many choices. If I manage to go and I'm fast enough by hi m then I probably 
get out there. And sure enough I was still very fast at running. And I got to the gate and 

they were yelling and screaming to me to come from the other side they saw me coming. 

And the officer of the German women and the Slovak blockalteste were coming in and 
one grabbed me and gave me flap in the face and said what barrack are you from. She 
wanted to know the numbers. She was only interested in the numbers. Where in which 

one somebody went mi ssing. How many to count. So I got out t here and we went  to the 

Birkenau and we got into place where we got t o shower. And we were instead of 1,000, 

that later turned out to be the y wanted 1,000 workers. We were 1,070. Oh, so 70 had t o 

staythere. Sohere was guard 
who was working for Mengele pulli ng out another 70 now. 
There were now women there in this group who were pregnant who already could show 
that they were pregnant. You see, some people came to Auschwitz wit hout knowing that  
they are pregnant and some who knew that they were havi ng starti ng pregnanc y but didn't 

show so t he y got there. And now they were pi cked out who already showed and some 

were. The woman who was sleeping across me during these weeks there she was 

pregnant. And I had such a nice warm body to m y feet to warm it while we were 

sleeping. B ut I lost her there.  

[Interviewinterrupted by turning overtape.]
 
A: You thi nk it di dn't  work? 

Q: It's tape two side two and you were talking about being in Birkenau and the y t ook the 

pregnant women. 

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
48 
A: Yeah. We now had 1,070 and out of all of us got a shower. But 70 was not allowed to 
come out from there. They sta yed t here in t hat  room and right there t hey were gassed. 

You know that thi s is t he same place you can either throw in gas or you give shower. 

Most co mes from the same. So then we were given uniform --  
Q: Did you know about  gassing at that -- t hen?   
A: Oh yes, by then we knew it. When they were cutting our hairs the Slovak girls were 

telling us about the gassing. They were telling us what 's happening to our mothers and t o 

our sisters. The y couldn't be happier to see us going ____ sick from what the y were 

telling us. As I told you these people were ani mal s already. The y were absolutely happy 

to see us suffer. And they many ti mes pointed out that you are lucky because you came so 

late that you will st ill survive the end. We came here four years ago when you went to 
balls and you had 5 o'cl ock tea said you just di dn't know what  to do i n your very comfort 
and warm houses and you were looking for the luxuries of life. Yes, we were. True. That 

was our fault we were because we had no idea what the y are going through. But even if 

they would we coul dn't  have believed it anyway. It was unbelievable for human beings 

that this is happeni ng t o the other human being. Like when we went arriving at 

Auschwitz what we saw there on the other side, we thought that t hese people were craz y. 

The y are mentally sick and the y were thrown into this camp because they had to be kept 
away from 
--
 otherwise why would they be behind that -- behind what? Again I cannot 
think of the word. 
Q: Fence or wires or --  

A: Yeah.  

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
49 
Q: So now there were 1,000 of you. The y had taken the 70 awa y? 
A: Yes. Then we were taken into a train which was taking us across Germany to 

?Thuringen? and then from there this was Buchenwald's outer-commando where we went 

to work.  
Q: And thi s is August 1944? 
A: Right. And there everyt hing was just beaut iful and luxurious compared to whatever 

we had seen before. Here there was a barrack which had rooms. And in each room there 

were eight times double beds. One about each other. There was nothi ng else there but 

they gave blankets, one underneath and one above you like military. And there was a 

long table in that room and two -- on two sides there were t wo -- what's what you sit on? 

Q: A chair?   
A: No.  
Q: Benches?  

A: Benches. And t hat was that. And there was even a litt le stove in i t. We didn't know 

what the st ove will  do for us, but in the winter it was really wonderful  to have it. In the 

summer also we were someti mes t rying to steal some coal and make a little hot water to 

wash ourself. But they were giving half number of food compared to Auschwitz. 

Probably luxury food compared to Auschwitz. And there was a campsite and there were 
not hours and hours standing outside in Appell . It was probably just an hour, hour and a 
half was in Appell. And then there was a fact ory about four miles away where we went to 

work. That was ?IG Farbenindustrie?.   

Q: How'd you get there? 

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
50 
A: Walked.  
 
Q: So you walked four mil es to the factory and four miles back?  

A: Yeah. It was about an hour walk each wa y. I guess it ma y have been about four miles. 

And we had dogs t o walk with the SS people with us and it was a decent big set up where 
the prior people who were there working died out because the factory has been working 
with saltpeter salt and that ruined the livers. So when thi s group died out the y wanted 

another 1,000 people and that's it. The y had t o have the workers.  

Q: What ki nd of work did you do? 

A: It was a _____. We were filling the bomb bodies with that -- shoul d I try to find 

English?  

Q: That's oka y. And so you went 
--
 what was a t ypical day like there? 
A: Well, it depends what you were doing. Most of the ti me I was working in the mill 

where this saltpeter came in as bi g bags and solid and it had to be worked up to powder it 

up. So you were to bake it up, somebody broke it, the other one was t hrowing it into the 

mil l, and t hen others had to shovel  the powder awa y into other bags in which they w
ere 

taking it to the part of the factory where they are mixing t hat with other things to make 

that filling. And some people someti mes were working to put awa y the filled bombs. Or 

it was more of from this size on to big ones you were to carry from one place to the other 
where the y would put t he filling into it so what makes it -- 
Q: Hold together?   

A: The other wa y around. To break up --  

Q: To expl ode?  

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
51 
A: To expl ode, oka y. Explosive, i t has to be put at the end. Then t he y were put into the 
packaging of it of which we were very diligentl y t aking, stealing the t wo sides what was 

to hold it because we knitted that i nto stockings. And if not kni tting then we were 

crocheting somethi ng. You needed something, you were cold. It was fall coming and it 
was ____ and we were standing out there i t was not funny. But we managed. We stole as 
much as we could and we were some of us was quite good at it. I was really good at 

stealing coal. My hand fit into between the wooden planks and some people were quite 

good at stealing some potatoes. I was good at going for seconds in the way that I was 

ready and willing t o pack off extra trunks whi ch came in and if you worked too fast to 

remove the merchandise from it the y gave you another soup. Very i mportant thi ng 

because out of the 14 there was somebody who wasn't able to go out, or 16 of us, who 
wasn't able to go out to get his meal. We're hungry, I mean we're always hungry. 
Q: So you found that the women were supporti ng each other and -- 

A: Yeah --  

Q: Helping each ot her 
--
 
A: Yeah, we were a good group t ogether, the 16. But we were not all 16 but there were 

mother with two daughters there in our room. And the five of us, that's eight. There was 

another mot her wit h her daughter who she didn't know that she was pregnant and who 
was taken out several months lat er from us. And her the mother's daughter younger sister 
was there with her t wo younger si sters. So there were four of them. Okay. Four, and we 

were five, and there were three. And there was a Rebbetzin from ____. What's Slovakia
's 

capital now? Anywa y, originally we went to work the same place in this mill. Then m y 

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
52 
aunt complained that she cannot do it. Alt hough I was working i n a lot of her work and 
also m y cousin -- 

Q: You sa y, so you were with other relatives? 

A: Yes.  
Q: Had yo u been with these relatives all along? 
A: Yes. We were together in -- these were t he five in Auschwitz who out of that four 

stayed toget her and I was taken back. This is my father's youngest si ster, another sister's 

daughter, and that daughter's two sister-in-laws. Quite young one, the one was 12 years 

old the smaller one. And the other one was already at m y age. So there we worked. And 

then m y cousin and my aunt both wanted t o get out of that factory work. And they 

somehow got into the sewing room. Which probably was better suited for somebody who 
is soft and they di dn't have to march out and back. That happened right on campus. And 
slowly we managed to get through this ti me. Less and less food. More and more deep air 

raids. So t here was no steam coming fro
m Marburgthen wecouldn't work. We werejust 

sitting out  there and do nothing, but we had to be brought  out and brought back. You 

have to go, you know. And so sl owly winter came and we were steali ng left and right 

pieces of material so we sewed together something what should be stocking to cover our 

bare legs. Then from this bags of which the saltpeter was thrown out we made raincoat 
that was five ti mes deep paper. So we cut out something where you put your head in and 
two arms room and you were covered with that at least on the wa y out and back. Not all  

the water was in your coat only the half of it. Wel l, we were worki ng this wa y through 

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
53 
next spring. But by next spring it was very littl e work. Very little mat erial coming into 
the factory. 

Q: What was your heal th like?   

A: Well we started to become yellow, our skin and also our e yes from this materi al what 
was catching us. Because that was coming out not only inside where you worked with it 
but they were horse made -- well I should have started better. The factory was on the 

ground. It was covered with roads and was covered with forests, and forest was made 

from that was all fake. Just -- 

Q: Artificial trees?   

A: Yeah. Just so that from the airplane it shoul d look like it's a -- 

Q: Like a camouflage?  
A: Sure. And so you walked through that and all over little horse brought up that bitter 
almond ki nd of poisonous gases which you inhaled. You inhaled inside and you inhaled 

outside. This is the reason these factories were never bombed. We were praying that 

when the pl anes went by. We were pra ying, we didn't expect to get out alive from there. 

Why shouldn't  we then finish it now? No, we were never bombed. They didn't know we 

were there. So in March by then we were cl eaning all the places where used to be 

mercha
ndise. We had t o saubermachen, to make it clean. To wipe it, swipe it, do 
something with it. It's a real German thing to make you do nothing with cleaning and 

cleaning and cleaning. The y don't give you anyt hing to clean wit h, but you're cleaning.  

Q: How di d you clean? 

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
54 
A: With your hand, wit h your leg. You got something together from under the trees they 
had some leaves on it and with the leaves you were, you tried. You tried to do li ke you're 

working. Then when there was no work whatsoever inside then the y 
made me and a few 
others build roads. So we were having this little carriages taking the stones, throwing it 
out, other ones started t o put them down. The t hird one had to go through with that 
musher, which mushed the roads. But that  was no work ei ther because there was no need 

for that road. There was no need t o do anyt hing there, but they made you do something.   

Q: Did anybody try to escape?   

A: From t here there was no escape.  

Q: No escape? 

A: It was all completel y covered. Complet ely covered. We did see human beings outside 
walking when we were standing on the Appell , on the Appellplatz on the other side there 
was a road on which somet i mes peasants with horse carriages went by. The y knew we are 

there. Don't tell me they didn't, we knew that t hey were there. But there was no wa y of 

getting out . Then one day in March it was a nice morning like that very bright and we 

were out there doing practically not hing. At around 11 o'clock-ish they came that we 

have to go back fast int o the camp. Fast we going, going, going because of leaving. And 

that evening we left the camp. We started to walk. And it was a big long walk.  
Q: This is everybody? 
A: The whole camp. And then they stopped us one place where we 
--
 what I didn't tell 
you that we had one lady with us in the kitchen who was a Rebbetzin who was counting 

the Jewish calendar. And was telli ng us when it was Rosh Hashanah, when it was Yom 

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
55 
Kippur. Nobody eat on Yom Kippur. It di dn't  matter. What we had was sta ying there, 
nobody will take it  from us. And so the l ast day 
--
 last ni ght when we were in the camp 
she said that it was first night of Pesach. And we went to her room and she made from 

so me flour what she st ole in the kitchen some flat bread and she was giving us all a little 
bit of it. And we were remi nding ourself that it is holida y. It turns out that she was only 
wrong wit h one da y. The next night when we were out on the road that was r
eally the 

first night of Pesach. That was very i mportant. 

Q: What di d you feel like when you were eating that flour and water? 

A: I don't know. We just thought that -- we thought back to that tradition how it looked at 

home. It was something to help a little. Of course you realize that by then very few of us 

was friendly enough with the One above us to believe that we are having this holida y 
because of Hi m. But there were two little girls also on the kitchen, the small kitchen 
which was peeling potatoes. They were a ____ two beautiful little daughters. Some 12 

and 13-
year
- old redheads with lot s of locks in their hair as their new hair grew out. And 
these two girls have not eaten anything what look like meat piece or bone piece in that 

food what the y had all year long. They kept tri ed to be kosher. They were very kosher 

after liberation I heard of them. The y lived a very kosher l ife. But very few sta yed with 

that belief. I didn't. Anyway, as I said these holida ys the y were really something in that 
surrounding. Anywa y, we decided after that second night when we were again together 
outside there and we were holiday that next ni ght we are going to try to get together. We 

will try to find each other and we will get t ogether. And that night when we started to 

wake we saw that a lot of the SS people were i n civilian cl othing. Or one was still with 

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
56 
the big ____ cape but had been on a bic ycle. So from their carriage all these things got 
off and they started to go in every direction. At that poi nt I said to m y cousin that I go 

too. If they go, I go.  

[Interview interrupted by phone ringing.] 
A: Sorry. So on that point m y aunt and m y cousin said that I'm craz y and the y both left 
me. I said you cannot keep me. So I started out  from that l ittle road where we were from 

which there was a li ttle forest on this side, quit e a few trees, I shoul dn't call it a forest. 

But it was still very early spring you could see too that on the other si de of that there's a 

road on which I could see military going. So I said this is not the place I want to be at. I 

want to go from here. And I, I just went. 

Q: By yourself? 
A: By myself. After which point the y started t o run after me. And by the time we first 
stopped we were ni ne of us. Of the nine of us only my cousin and I spoke German. And 

we were wal king across a field and we pul led out some sugar carrot kind of what still is 

there. This i s animal feed for the winter. So wi th that we put some and we ate some. By 

then we didn't see bread the last ten da ys. So i t was good to have something and we had a 

knife. I could slice i t up and everybody got a slice of that. We weren't that hungry 

anymore. And we walked with it i nto the next village and on the edge of the village at the 
last house we stopped and went into a peasant court. 
Q: What was the name of the village, do you know? 

A: No. I certainly know it's Frielendorf and ____. And we stopped t here and the German 

peasant came out and t hey didn't know what t o make of us. The y knew what we are 

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
57 
except they didn't know if they want to throw us out or not. And we said we wil l not 
bother you just let us have rest here where your animals are, and he did. And actually he 

made us go up so we can be up where it 's dry and warm and nice. And we laid down 

there and we rested ourself and evening came. And all of a sudden we heard speaking. 
And the speaking went on and it was clear t hat  the German guy who also escaped from 
the military wants t o hide there and wanted to come up. And the guy from there was just 

telling hi m that thi s is not a good spot here, he takes hi m to another spot. And we were 

very comforted. We were very ready to jump and go, but they ran away. And the next 

morning the peasant's wife came out and said you will have to leave. We said oh we will 

we just needed this rest  and we are very thankful and we go. And then we brought back 

the group backwards where we knew now where the fields were, made them sit there and 
wait. And my cousin and I started to go from house to house and tell them that we are 
hungry and we would ask for some bread if they can spare. And everybody was able to 

spare some. Some had some cold cut to add to it. Some didn't. But everywhere the y were 

cooking. We had no idea, but it was Good Fri day. And that afternoon, of course when we 

came back we told t hem all that we cannot  eat it all here because our sisters are waiting 

outside for us and we want to share it wit h them. And the y accept ed. Some gave us an 

extra piece of bread because of it. Some just let us go. So we went back and we again got 
some of this carrot kind of things. And with t hat the bread was very good. And that 
afternoon we heard a lot of noises, motors and big machinery noises. And as we looked 

toward the west they were stopping in front of this peasant's house. So we looked out, 

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
58 
saw the mai n street over the guy's house where we spent t he night before. And we saw 
that he has a white underpants on a -- 

Q: Pole --   

A: Stock outside hanging out on t he street . And the y are also hanging out there. And 
there are a lot of other stores have something white hanging out there. And we l ooked 
back and we saw there's a kind of star on t his machinery. Yes. The y stopped there that t he 

rest should come up to them. And we ran out t o them. These were the first Ameri can 

G.I.'s who arrived there. And it was a magnificent, magnificent afternoon
. When the y 

heard who we are, the y started to l ook for something to give us, food. And whatever the y 

had it was only from the breakfast ration what they had left over. So we asked for a 

cigarette. And eight of us smoked one Camel and all eight of us had seen stars at  broad 
dayl ight. Oh it was strong. It was very, very strong. But it was wonderful. And the y kept 
jumping to find some chocolate and there was some God knows what what was still left 

over from the breakfast . And then they got each other soap came our way. The y saw that 

we need some. And by the ti me we turned around the peasant's wife was coming that we 

should come into her ki tchen. She had a huge dish of hot potatoes, fresh potatoes in its 

skin. It was just I didn't  understand how it went awa y so fast. You should have seen this 

group taking care of that potatoes. And then we went again out t o the street and from 
everywhere around seeing how was in our littl e valley.  And not big mountains but the 
mountains had all people come out from there. Russian girls who were in P.O.W. camp, 

black African, French guys who were working as -- the y were not  P.O.W.'s and the y were 

not in concentration camp but the y were something in between. They were able to get 

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
59 
Red Cross packages once a month. The y were handled qui te different from us. The y were 
half human. And t he y were not very nice. They were kissing our hands sa ying hello t o us 

like we are human being now again. And i t was a gorgeous, gorgeous afternoon. I don't 

have to tell you that Good Frida y will always remi nd me of that. That was a beautiful 
Good Friday. Next  da y though we started to be very scared because the American troops 
started to go backward and we begged them take us along. We thought that --   

Q: You were speaki ng English? You could speak English? 

A: Well, it was not real ly English. I haven't used them for six, seven years. And now I 

was full with my German so it was a mixt ure. But yes, I was the one who was telling 

them who we are and what we are. For all of us I was the only one who spoke some 

English. It wasn't ____ English and many ti mes I heard a G.I. sa y your English i sn't ____. 
Well, I tell you why, what I didn't know how to say, but I knew how to say it a French 
way.  I was using t he French wa y. I mixed it with a lot of German. Luckily the y were 

coming from France so what was French was not so strange to them, but m y English 

altogether was. But  they had fun with it and they were so good to us. The y were so 

wonderful. If you imagine what it is to feel human again. That people count you into th
e 

human race, not more, just that much. Then the ma yor of the city was ordering a 

kindergarten to be emptied for us. It didn't matter that every furniture was this small and 
the toilets were also hal f of a normal outhouse size and that  low, but we had it. And the 
American G.I.'s started to come to look us up. And we had one of the two people with us 

in this group was also a young mother with her daughter. The daughter was 12 and we 

got into camp. Now she was big 13-
year
-old. A gorgeous girl, but of course y
ou couldn't 

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
60 
see that then, just something. And she was just  layi ng there on the ____ and the y were 
asking what she would like to have and she sai d chocolate and salami. So this young 18, 

19-
year
-old G.I. ran away t o the PX and brought chocolate and salami  and put it into her 
mouth and held her head to eat it t hough t oget her that wa y. You can i magine how sick 
she was, okay? It was close to put ting us away with all the goodness, but the y were 
wonderful. Then the y heard who we are, what we were, it was stories to tell, right? And 

when the y heard that we haven't  seen meat. 
End of File Two 
Beginning File Three 
Q: You were talking about liberati on and t he GI™s, the American GI™s trying to get you 

some meat.
 
A: The y went out to shoot deer. The y found in the kitchen some of their comrades who 

was able to skin it and clean it and prepare it . And the y brought it like here is dinner. The 

people of the city were ordered to everybody bring some cooked food to a certain place 

where we were fed. So everybody brought a huge ____ with that. They t hrew it t ogether, 

mixed it together. It was wonderful. It was all t he veggies i n it and somewhere probably 

were some, some meat or bone or whatever wi ll give it some smells. And of course now 

they came with the questions of what we now needs are. I know the y cannot do more but  
we had to get normal rooms and t he post office was cleared awa y for us. And across the 
post office was a hotel and that was cleaned up for us. And the Germans made us clean. 

So the y were to clean for us and cook for us which the y didn't  like to do. And we didn't 

like their food but now we started t o be strong enough to have opi nion about food. And 

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
61 
we lived there until August. The American sol diers were not allowed to mix wit h 
Germans, with German girls. They couldn't see any. They were not  al lowed to meet the 

Russian P.O.W.™s so onl y the Jewish Hungarian refugees were part ners for them. So the y 

were allowed to make dances and i nvite us to go to dances. And of course that meant that 
we made friends. And t hey brought the cigarette and brought some food. And the y had 
resting groups close to the outskirt of Frielendorf where the y could go to the beach too. 

And on the beach there was no one allowed to go with them but us. Not the Germans, not 

who lived there, not nobody but we. So there I will have to tell you first a story because 

this is a good one. There was a man on the pool side sitting all completel y dressed up to 

his everythi ng on hi m and was sitting there alone and looking ahead of him and doing 

nothing. And all the rest was enjoying the rest and the sun. So it didn't  take too long that 
m y friends were pushing me to go and talk to hi m. It turned out t hat he was Ralph Kutz 
from Clevel and. He had gas stations. When he had to leave his wife home the y had their 

son the da y before. He was allowed to go to the hospital t o see them once and right after 

that they got on the ship and went over, shipped out. So he didn't have another chance to 

see his wife and chi ld but that one, that litt le son of his. And he was crying on our 

shoulder and we were cryi ng on his shoulder which he felt wonderful about. He never 

had sisters. His mother alwa ys wanted to have daughters and never had. And as we 
became more and more friends during the summer he kept coming practically daily to us. 
He came to ask first of all to try to make a Friday night for hi m. So he brought everything 

from the PX. He brought from the candles from the ____ everything you name it, 

everything. The soup in the big can. And we had holida y and we were crying into his 

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
62 
handkerchief so he had to buy handkerchiefs and handkerchiefs and handkerchiefs 
because we needed lots of handkerchiefs. And we became so close fri ends that he was 

asking me and m y camp sister who was in the same room with me that we shoul d go to 

be his sisters. Go t o live with his mother and he will guarantee he will marry us off. It 
was awful hard for hi m to understand that we still hope t o see our husbands so we will go 
back to Hungary and not straight to America. And then from Hungary I wrote hi m and I 

got married to Andy. Probably not  even then but right after that when I was already 

pregnant and yes and I asked him if the y had any of the baby things left over after that 

first baby. I will very appreciate because there's practically not hing available here. Then I 

didn't hear of them. I knew that in November he went back, he gave address and what not 

and that's where we wrote. And we also sent a picture m y girlfriend and me two of us a 
picture. But that was later. Because that ended everything. The package what came in 
was this large. I was seven months pregnant when that arrived one morning. It was some 

80 pounds, huge. There was one piece on the t op of it what was a huge piece which was 

kind of christening outfit. All the rest was packed in a depart ment store. And the 

department store's paper was put on the top of it and they wished well. They sent me a 

robe, they sent me slippers. And we sent t his picture to hi m. And by then he wrote of 

another baby. The y have the second one. So Andy and I where we started to physically be 
in better shape we bought something but  we t hought it 's a ni ce gift item and we had 
mai led two of it. One t o his mother, and one to his wife. Not ever since then I got a word 

from them. Either t hey got hurt that I want to pay back what the y did or God knows what 

now I don™t know. Or t he wife became jealous because seeing our pictures. Now we 

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
63 
turned around from what Ralph had seen and I can very well i magi ne that she did not like 
that friendship. And since we are not  going to become his sisters, I got married and m y 

girlfriend got married t he same ti me, same day under the same ____ and we did not go to 

them. But the man there on that pool side full y dressed because he's an Orthodox Jew he 
wouldn't get undressed. 
Q: So you stayed, until -- how long did you stay? 

A: Well, it was al most beginning of August when we came home not  because we wanted 

to sta y -- 

Q: Right --  

A: But because Hungary didn™t ask for us. Now some in our group were from 

Yugoslavia. The Yugoslavs had asked for the Jews. And f or them buses were given by 
the arm y. And somebody, a young officer who wanted to find his relative in 
Theresienstadt, came down to be t he head of the group and there was enough room for us 

a few from Hungary that wanted to go wit h them and we could come with them. So we 

came back home.  
 
Q: So you went back to your town, to your city. What did you find when you got there?  

A: First I went to Budapest. And we arrived to Budapest I looked up my cousins and m y 

aunt™s and uncle™s place. And I saw that m y aunt's apart ment had a hole on the edge on 
the corner. But I went up anywa y and I found m y aunt t here and she was screaming your 
father's home. Now this I did not expect. I had mentioned to you my father was a sick 

man from World War I time. I certainly did not expect him be the survivor. But he was 

the only survivor. And so next da y I got on a t rain and made it down to m y hometown. 

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
64 
My father knew of me alive since the spring. The y listened to the Red Cross radio and 
somebody in the ci ty picked up my name and came to tell hi m. But of course he didn't 

know that I am coming now. And didn't know if I'm coming at  all. He just knew that I'm 

alive. And he was might y happy that his only daughter was alive. 
Q: You just came home and he was there, i s t hat when you -- 
A: I went t o the store. And the store was open. The three old men were there. I stepped 

into the st ore and his first question was where did you leave your mot her? And the 

second was that I'm ashamed to show them that I had arms like that. It was ____ but it 

looked so good, so healthy like I was full with life. And he was ashamed to tell that I'm 

pulled from concentration camp I l ook so good. He was very happy that I am looking so 

good.  
Q: And then what happened?  
A: Then we -- he had already by then invited a lot of people who didn't have home where 

to go home to. And here was his big house and there was nobody in t here. Except he 

brought m y aunt down, m y mother's sister, to cook for them and clean for them. Because 

in Budapest there was nothing to be eaten. Th ey were hungry. And he thought that he 

alwa ys will  be able to make enough in the store that we should have food and all these 

people put moneys together for my aunt to go to the market and whatever she can buy to 
buy. And so they were living wit h her. 
Q: W
hat about your husband, your first husband? 
A: There was not even a word then about hi m. Much later --  

Q: You sti ll didn't know?   

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
65 
A: It was i n the fall first when somebody came home who told me that he was wi th hi m 
between Gunskirchen and Mauthausen as t he y were marching them over Gunski rchen 

and that he looked good and he was in good shape but then next morning the Germans 

made them get up from that stop where they were resting fast and go. And who did not 
move fast enough t he y shot. Nobody coul d tell me what happened to him. But that was 
the most probably way that we never heard of hi m again. And according to all the records 

that's what happened. 

Q: So you stayed in your village -- in your town?   

A: Yes, wi th m y father. And the y wanted me t o take over t he house, which I couldn™t do. 

I couldn™t. I wouldn't move with him in my mother™s house what was natural for her to 

do. But then m y aunt went home. And one morning when there was market da y our old 
mai d came to visit the city to see if somebody is home and when she found me there she 
begged herself that she doesn't want to get pai d just food with us and live with us and she 

wants to come back. And she came back to work for me. We had plenty to work there. 

The Germans were i n t hat house. First Hungarian officers, then Germans. Then t he ____. 

The ____ were the underground Hungarian left. And after that the Russians. And the 

Russians were dancing on the top of the table. The y pulled out the wood for cooking. 

You name i t, they did quite a job on it. So we had quite a time to clean the house. 
Q: You stayed how long?   
A: I sta yed there until 1950 when all of us then m y father's st ore was nationalized by the 

commoners. My husband's business was in danger. 

Q: So at what poi nt did you remarry? 

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
66 
A: Oh, '47.  
Q: And how did t hat come about?  

A: Andy came home and out of Rosh Hashanah of 1945 the egg farm was about 20 miles 

out of m y city. And his brother was already home much earlier. He came home from the 
Russian front wit h the arm y and he was it was still winterti me an d he was already free 
man there. And then Andy came into the ci ty and went into m y father™s store and was 

telling that he doesn't want to spend the t i me out there. This is a little room and farming 

left for them. That it 's too little for him alone and not just  speaki ng about his brother. The 

brother was married by then. He was leave i t for his brot her out t here. He doesn't want to 

stay there. He's l ooking for a place to stay at so m y husband invited him to sta y at our 

house --  
Q: Your father -- 
A: Has a room there -- 

Q: Your father? 

A: Yeah. And we have a room there and he brought hi m furniture and it got furnished. 

His first thing was that he went out  and exchanged farm products for glass and the y put 

glass into our windows because it was kind of cold in wintertime without windows. And 

the next thing was that he exchanged something else. It was all exchange there was 
nothing in that part  of the world but exchange items. And then m y fat her one nice day 
stood in front of me and said my daughter I want to tell you something. You were not 

supposed to know about that because the two friends would have been forever enemies if 

they knew but Andy loved you and he tol d so to your mother and your mother told him 

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
67 
not to ever mention a word to you because you don't see anybody but poor Andy. It 
would be just hurt ing everybody. But I can see m y father said to David he will stop and 

talk to you about it. His wife didn't come home with his child. You're here alone I can see 

that soon he will talk to you about it. And I tell  you I would be very, very happy t o know 
that if I died I have a man like him with you. It didn't matter where I stand. There were 
two men who would be happy, m y father and Andy, and I cannot be happy anymore in 

this life. I lost m y happiness. So why not? And when soon Andy talked to me I agreed. 

And so May of ‚46 we got married and he had only one request to have again a child as 

soon as possible tells hi m that he'd like the one already had. That is what he missed. And 

yes quite soon I became pregnant. In April of ‚47 I had my son. 

Q: And your son's nam e?  
A: Paul, after my first husband.  
Q: And then you sta yed in Hungary for -- 

A: Yes we sta yed in Hungary. First we st a yed in Hungary, Miskolc until 1950. Then as I 

mentioned to you, my father's business was nationalized. Half of our apart ment was taken 

away. And Andy felt that this is t he time we escape, we go. So he gave me mone y that I 

shall buy an apart ment no matter what it costs and where it  is in Budapest and it is awa y 

from here. That was enough for me. And then we went up to Budapest in October of 
1950 and that was the time when they were putting the people out  of their apart ments of 
their homes. All around us the y were stopping during the night, a truck came and just 

everybody went. So we tried that too. We had to fight not only the Nazis, we had to fight 

the commoners too. My father died in 1955. For our tenth wedding anniversary we 

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
68 
decided we give each other that we are making his stone having t he names of everybody 
from the two families. And we di d. And we had the stones. 

Q: This is gravest ones?   

A: And si x weeks later the revoluti on broke out. And we t ook advantage of it. We left 
Hungary then, ‚56. 
Q: And you came t o the United St ates?   

A: Yes. We waited a long ti me in Austria before we could come because we didn't have 

close relatives here. But then we came here. 

Q: The three of you, your husband and your son. And where did you settle first? 

A: New York. We had a friend there. And because of that because they t ried to make us 

as comfortable as possi ble and as Jewish wa ys as possibl e the y didn't  let us go out to 
Arkansas where the ____ wanted us to go because my husband's dipl oma was to be 
useable there much bet ter. He was a Doctorate in Ani mal  Husbandry. On Park Avenue, 

on Fifth Avenue t here's no ani mal husbandry, you know. But by the ti me we settled 

ourselves my son became a little American boy and we st a yed in New York. And then I 

retired and m y husband retired and Paul was al ready down here since 1969.  

Q: What ki nd of work did you do?  

A: I did office work al ways because of that little English what I had i t had me not to start 
as a physical worker. And then in ‚68 I got to t he Ford Foundati on and I was with them 
for 16 and a half years before I retired. 

Q: And then you moved to Washi ngton?   

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
69 
A: Not then because my husband still worked. He was working until 1986 for the 
Deutsche B ank and then he retired too. Then my son sa ys oh what are you doing still 

there? Let's go down. And that's when we came down. 

Q: Was it hard to adjust to life in the United States? 
A: Well, let  me put it this wa y. Not for me because I loved Americans. I mean I had 
manic everyt hing what was American was okay with me. My husband had a very, very 

hard ti me and never could go back to his profession, I think of a profession. But he who 

had a doctorate who could not do anything. Friends here didn't know what to do with it 

either. Should he have known the Ford Foundation would have given hi m a nice job. And 

he would have had a gorgeous future being in charge of third world countries 

agricultures. There was lots to do here in New York except  nobody knew what to do with 
this. Yes, we were refugees. We were very proud that nobody gave us anything. We were 
a perfect welfare case but we didn't know about it and we didn't want to know about it. 

And what I have what you see we the two of us worked together and I don't owe 

anybody, oka y? That was very good.  

Q: If we can now talk a little bit about the effect of all this. How is this, your experiences 

effected your feelings of being Jewish?  

A: I never would have changed out  from Judaism. But I did not have anyt hing to do wit h 
the religion and a God which let t hat happen as it was. And I complet el y lost all interest 
in it. Until m y baby first moved in me. That brought me back to it  and accepting that 

there's somebody above us who knows more t han we do. No I never really became a 

religious Jew in that sense. But I know a l ot probably more than most of the girls had

known of religion. My father was very proud of that. He alwa ys hoped for a boy and he 
didn't have a son so he taught me. And he felt good about  me knowing some. And I felt 

goodabout myselfthat my grandparentswere sohappy with me.
 
Q: You had talked about how your thoughts, you still have thoughts 50 years later about 
your mother. In any ot her wa y has your experience sta yed with you i n other wa ys?   
A: That experience stays with you forever. You try to forget it. You try to push it out of 

your mind because you cannot live constantly with this. My husband whenever he had 

heard or seen somet hing. He could not wat ch on a television a show which started with a 

train and that was t hat for three weeks he had t he nightmares. He was yell ing and 

screaming each ti me he had a cold and he had a real temperature. He was fighting, he was 

seeing hi mself going through what  he went through. He went from Auschwitz to Dachau 
and the ____ peopl e had hurt his back. He went through his own hell . So we had tried t o 
not to talk about it . And definitely did not  want to talk about it i n front of our child. We 

did not even know that our child knew where we were before. Unti l i n 1969 the first time 

he went back to Europe after he finished, graduated from engineeri ng school Œ 

Q: This is your son?  

A: The first place he went was Dachau. He stopped in ?Meiningen? and asked our friends 

who lived there how to go out to Dachau and he went to Dachau next  morning. I still to 
this da y I don't  know how he knew, who ment ioned that in front of him, or who else tol d 
hi m because we certainl y did not. I couldn't i magine that I can hurt m y child with pain 

like that I shall be telli ng all these what I was telling you or even more to him. I wanted 

to save hi m from t hat forever. I just couldn't bring m yself to talk about that. The first ti me 

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
71 
I was talking about  all t hat was in 1990 we were sitting i n front of the operating room and 
his father was operated on at Georgetown Uni versity Hospital where I first talked to hi m 

about where I'd been. He came home once earlier and sai d I belong t o the second 

generation and the y are encouraging us to ask you to give us oral history. And I jumped 
up from the chair where I was sitti ng I run out  to the kitchen and he knew that he cannot 
ask me again about it. It's been much later in t he ‚70s sometimes when I first was able to 

talk to non- Jewish people mentioning where I was. I kind of it just came out of me. It was 

I don't know what I wanted to do with them if I wanted to scare them or what I wanted. 

But I couldn't sa y that to anybody who was Jewish. I just didn't want to talk about it at al l 

to Jewish people for years and years and years. And when they were talking about the 

Holocaust Museum my husband and I were both dead set against it. I couldn™t see it. I 
still cannot  underst and it. I still feel to a certai n degree that this is guilt mone y from the 
American government and from the American Jews. The y all feel much easier to put the 

moneys int o something than their hearts. And we will be alwa ys different. We cannot be 

understood by the Americans, and the Americans cannot be understood by us t otally. I 

still have t hat bitterness. My -- I had a boss in the end of the ‚50s whose family also 

perished there. And sa ys to me Suzanne you will have to t ell me how m y relatives 
perished. So at lunchti me when he was sitting on the switchboard and I was brown
;
bagging m y lunch and was eating at the desk he said tell me. And so I started to tell hi m 
that ?Mr. Rosengarden? I don't know I didn't know your relatives so I don't know how 
they, I only can tell you what was the average. And I started to tell hi m and in three or 

four minutes he stopped me he sai d Suzanne don't sa y that it hurts too much. And I think 

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
72 
this is what any Ameri can Jew feels. I spoke to quite a few just lately who said they don't 
want to go down t o the museum. The y don't want to see it. And t he y don't know nothing 

about it. There is a l ady here who I appreciate very much as an int elligent, deep feeling, 

good person. A few months ago in somehow it  came to me that she was asking about how 
Andy lost his wife. And I said well how, she had ?Steve? on her arm. She looked at me 
and I said don't  you know that everyone who went there with chil d perished? No, I didn't 

know that. And I became so very, very angry on that that I wanted to organize a seminar 

here that a few peopl e who I know were survi vors should talk t o these people.  I don't 

want them to hear all t he most awful things. I'm ready to t ell them some story which 

probably makes them even smile someti me. But the y should know some of the feelings 

we went through. They don't want to know it. So that's all I can tell you. I am not a good 
person. I am still angry. 
Q: Thank you so much for speaking of your experiences. This concludes the interview of 

Suzanne Foldes. It took place on January 25, 1996 in Silver Spring, Maryland. It was 

conductedby Gail Schwartz
.   

Q: This is tape three side two and we were tal king about your feelings and your 

reflections about your experience. You said you're sti ll angry?  

A: Yes. I t hink that's depression which won't l eave me unt il I'm alive. I cannot find 
solace. Nothing can give me solace. Not Yad Vashem, not this museum, not ____.  None 
of them. None of them is enough. But the one in Yad Vashem would be just the right 

thing to be at. I don't t hink that these small littl e things are not breaking it up, making it 

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
73 
less a whol e tragedy. Make it small tragedy. Make it something what where just ice 
appear.  

Q: You had talked earlier about how devastated you were about what happened to your 

mother and this ot her person helped you, looked out for you. After that what kept you 
going?  What do you think kept you going through this terrible, terribl e ti me?   
A: There's only one thi ng I can tell you, what I told the people around me. I was trying to 

keep them alive. I kept telling them that think about it as a badly administered ____ 

excursion. We were t hrough with it, we will get through with it. It's just ugly and we have 

to be in it now. B ut we will get out of it. And I did believe that if you let yourself go, you 

cannot live. And the onl y wa y to do it is if you keep yourself clean and clean and clean. 

Wash as much as you can. Clean as much as you can. That 's the only thing. It's not 
eating, it's cleanl iness. Because once you get lice you go. In our room in the camp which 
was the out skirts I mean the outer-l ager of Buchenwald we had this little lady, the rabbi 's 

wife, she kept on her head a turban constantly. Never removed it, never washed. It was 

full with lice. And we just decided that we won™t get in danger because of her. And we 

decided she was never out working. She never came out. Somehow, I don't know how, 

she managed that she never had to come out. And we decided in the factory that we are 

going to take home some what™s t he, it™s a fluid what you clean with, petrol. Petrol from 
the factory and we will  wash her head with it. And we did. And we threw awa y her 
turban and she was screaming. And she t hought about it and we got another turban for 

her and we washed her. Now that's the only, onl y, only wa y you coul d stay alive. And 

what kept you alive. And of course I had my aunt there. Not that I loved her so dearly, 

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
74 
but she was still the sister of m y father. So you wanted to take care of her. You wanted to 
bring her home. And I did. 

Q: Did you form any cl ose friendships with people, not your relatives, but new -- 

A: Oh yes. There were two ladies, who I became very close friend of. The one I mention 
to you as a lager
;
si ster who got married the same da y I di d. And she lived in our house 
until she got married. And another one who was a her husband and family had a bakery in 
Miskolc and she was -- she was a strange lady. She was not well educated but she had 

such a smooth wa y of being friend. Probably she was too femini ne to that I would toda y 

think about her that I want her for friend, and I would have rather second thought that 

probably she was lesbi an. She was that ki nd of lady. But then she was very good to be a 

friend there. We were carryi ng the bombs together and we were remembering old songs, 

old poems. We had to use our praise, you know. That was also very important. We were 
trying the ____ whatever we needed to remem ber things. And she was good for that. 
Q: Are there any sounds or smells that bri ng thoughts back to you?   

A: That bit ter almond. There™s a dri nk which i s made of an al mond flavor. I can't take it. 

And of course I never learned how to wash something clean white. Everything becomes 

gra y in my hand. And I was washing there and all m y fingers were bleeding but I couldn't 

make it white. There are two things my mother never made me learn around the 

household to wash an it em. She sai d for that you alwa ys will have somebody do it for 
you. How wrong she was. But everything else she wanted me to know how to give 
orders. She said you cannot give orders unless you knew how to do it . And she alwa ys 

expected me tojust to bereadyto giveorde
rs. 

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
75 
Q: Do you get reparations?   
A: No. I got a very littl e in the late 50's or earl y 60's. A mini mal amount was given and 

since then whenever I asked I was negated fast. There was no words of something 

somebody was telling us that there is somethi ng being now given. But I didn't even go to 
make a telephone call t o ask about  it. I'm not i nterested anyway. It hurts too much when 
they sa y oh you don't. Why? Because again still the Germans are deciding. And then 

there's al wa ys a group of Jews who are serving them very well, you know. Just like they 

were in Hungary when the Germans came i n and the Jews were congregations giving out 

names, giving out who is the rich out of them, you name i t, everything. The y gave the 

synagogue buildings for them to horde all t he goods, the silvers, and t he golds. There 

always will  be Jews who are serving the Germans. The y usually will be Germans Jews 
though.  
Q: Is there any message you want to leave your family with, your grandchild? Anything 

special?  

A: My grandchild is a wonderful child. The child of a non-Jewish mother who t wo years 

ago was hi s father and I were talking about  something and his father was sa ying that only 

the two of us will be there who were born Jewish. Well, he meant me. And my grandson 

chimed in and me. He feels Jewish when he's with us. He's al ways spending the holidays 
with us. And then he spends the ot her holi da ys with his mother at  her house and the 
grandparent 's house. He's a sweetheart, he loves us dearly. I never talked to hi m about al l 

this. I didn't dare and I was not encouraged later. However he was here a few months ago. 

And God knows how, he said something where I said did you go to see Schindler's List? 

Interview with Suzanne Foldes  
76 
And he sai d yes. And t hen he was completely wiped out by it. And I dared to ask which I 
had asked his father somet i mes ago and he does not have the nerve to face the holocaust 

museum either. And I asked Michael and he said no he would like to go and want to go 

with his father. So I said if he wants to go would you tell me about it. And I asked if his 
school shouldn't go and he said it 's a good idea probably it should. But then since then I 
haven't spoken to him about that. It felt good that now I know that he was. When his 

friends were bar mitzvahs and bat mitzvahs and we kept going t o them. His father was 

asking me if he doesn't want to become thi s, then his grandfather was still alive. And he 

said to his father that he would have nothing against it except goi ng up there. I just have 

to accept it t his wa y. It hurts. He got the bigger birthday present on his 13th. We had 

given to hi m with telling hi m that if he was now Jewish he woul d have a mark on his 
birthda y but without that a Jewish boy is bar mitzvah at 13 no matter what. 
Q: Is there anything you'd like to add before we finish? Any thought, final thought?  

A: No, I don't melt away. I don't want to melt awa y now. Thank you very much. 

Q: Well, thank you for doing the i nterview. Thank you so very much.
