Q: So tell me  -- before 1940, tell me  about your
 childhood in Kavála. Can you describe it to me ?  
A: It was a very happy childhood. The Greeks are ver
y, very nice. We  never f -- had to hide our 
being Greek -- our being Jewish. I had a very, very
 good life and as a ma tter 
of fact, even today I 
still correspond with my  friends in Gr eece, the 
Or thodox friends, the Chr-Christian friends that 
were left alive. 

Q: So growing up you had a combination of Je
wish friends and also non-Jewish friends? 

A: Had a combination of mostly non-Jewish
 friends, and very few Jewish friends. 
Q: Tell me  about the Jewish comm
unity, how large wa
s it in Kavála? 
A: The community must  have been around 3,000 people. We  had our own community center, we 

had our own Jewish school, elementary school, a
nd everything was more 
or less independent for 
us, except be ing part of Greece, as fa r as taxes 
being paid and going into the army and filling all 
our ja -- obligations as Greek citizens. 

Q: And wha t  about your home  and your 
neighborhood, was it a Jewish neighborhood? 
A: No, we were not segregated, we lived in 
a Greek neighborhood, but we 
never felt different.  
Q: So did you ever, before 1940, while you™re living 
in Kavála, did you ever experience any anti-

Semitism?  

A: Not at all. Exactly the opposite. As a ma tter of 
fact, being the only Jew in
 the last year at my 
high school, I was elected presiden
t of the si -- of the class. 
Q: So tell me  about your schooling, did you ever
 go to any kind of Jewish school, or was it 
always public schools? 

A: I finished my element a ry school in the Jewish
 school that we had from the community and the 
rest of my e ducation was like 
all the other Greeks in Greek
s elem -- government schools.

Q: Okay. And can you describe to me a little bit more about Kavála, for somebody like myself, 
not knowing much about the place, can you 
give me  a description of that town? 
A: It was a city of about 50,000 people. It was cl
ose to the famous Philippi, about 10 kilometers 
from where Alexander the Great and his father ha
d their -- their palace, in the past . It was a 
tourist city. It was a beautiful 
city. Most of the people devoted 
themselves in the ma nufacturing 
and exporting tobacco. 

Q: Did your father work
 in that industry? 
A: My father had his own business, he was part
 of the industry, he used  to provide the -- the 
manufacturers with all the -- w
ith all they needed in orde
r to export the tobacco leaf. 
Q: And did your mother work outside of the home? 

A: No, she did not.  

Q: So describe to me  your home. 
Ca n you reme mber what it looked like? 
A: We  were only three people, and it was 
a very happy home . That™s all I can say. 
Q: Was it large, was it a house or an apartm
ent, what -- what was it physically like? 
A: Was originally an apar tment, then it was a house. 

Q: So you moved, or you m
ean you expanded the place? 
A: We  just moved, we di
d not expand, we also rema ined the three of us.  
Q: So you moved a couple times then, in your childhood? 

A: Twice. 

Q: And was there a long history -- 
you said you did not have other fa
mily in the area, so how did 
your imme diate family wind up in Kavála? 

A: We ll, my  father used to ma nufact ure chocolat
es. In 1928 they decided to build a factory in 
Kavála. And my father went there 
representing of the company. We  st
ayed there -- the fact that it 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0515

was burned in 1930, but my father changed his profession and he got involved with tobacco 
leafs, and was very happy and successful. We  d
ecide to st  -- de cided to stay in Kavála. 
Q: So, when you were born, were you -- wa
s your fa mily alrea
dy living in Kavála? 
A: No. I was born in Kavála, and I went back 
to Sa lonika, and we immi gra  -- or, we moved 
permanently to Kavála in 1929. 

Q: So you had a few years of your
 early childhood in Salonika? 
A: Yes. As a ma tter of fact, my first year, e
ducational years, was, surprisingly enough, in the 
German school in Salonika. 

Q: What kind of me mori es do you 
have of that -- that year? 
A: As far as I can reme mber, very good me mories.  

Q: And did you have any feelings of -- 
feeling anti-Semitic experiences there? 
A: No, that was Germany before Hitler. I™m ta
lking the 40 -- yeah, talk
ing about 1920™s. When 
Hitler came, we were already in Kavá la, that was 1933.  
Q: So, can you tell me  a little about
 the personalities of your parents?
 I wa nt to try to get a -- a 
sense of them, you know, just describe to 
me , you know, maybe as a youngster, as a childhood, 
from that perspective, what your 
parents personalities were like.  
A: We ll, my  father was community mi nded. He 
was the president and the representative of 
[speaks Greek here] in Kavála. He used to take
 care of the poor Jews in the community. They 
used to call him [speaks Greek here] de Kavála.The Jewish counsel of Kavála. My mother was 
very, very religious, and I was rais
ed in a religious environment. 
Q: So tell me  a little bit more about that, 
ma ybe -- ma ybe what were some  of your favorite 
holidays as a child, and -- and were you, you know, we
re you particularly interested in religion 
yourself?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0515  
5 
 
 
A: Yes, I was. We  used to go with my father every Saturday to the temple, and we used to 
observe all of the holidays. And up today, myself
 and my wife  continue
 to follow our religion 
and celebrate our holidays with our whole fa mily. 

Q: Do you have -- do you have me mories
 as a child of favorite holidays? 
A: Not exactly. Mostly Purim, was a very joyous holiday. 

Q: And wha t  were the languages th
at you were learning as a child? 
A: I was born as a Sephardi Jew, and automa
tically our language was Ladino. Then, in high 
school, I learned French. After 
high school I took English and I 
ma stered, more or less, the 
language of the time . Spanish came automa tic. 
Greek was amassed. So, actually, between one 

year old and 20 years old, I ma ster
ed five different languages.  
Q: And were you ar -- also st
udying or fa miliar with Hebrew? 
A: Yes. That was automa tic on the f -- on th
e s -- on the Jewish, you know, the community 
school that I attended the first 
six years, from age six to 12. 
Q: Now wha t  about your Bar Mitzvah, what
 kind of me mories do you have of that? 
A: Very joyful, but not like he re. Not spending like crazy, just ha
ve the family, have the friends, 

and celebrate in the synagogue.  

Q: And at that time  you were -- you still had mo
stly non-Jewish friends around that time  of your 
childhood?   

A: Yes. As I told you, we lived in the 
more or less Greek neighborhood, Orthodox neighborhood 
and all my friends, up to today, 
most of them were Greeks. 

Q: Do you reme mber the address, by any chance
, of either one of your home s where you grew 
up? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0515  
6 
 
 
A: Yes. It™s a very funny thing, as I told you, our
 city was 10 kilometers from Philippi, and the 
street name  wher-where we ha
d our home was Bucephalus Street, the name of Alexander the 
Great™s horse. 
Q: Is that where you had both of your 
childhood home s, on the same  street? 
A: No, no, no, this was after we moved in our own 
home . Originally I was born in a -- we were 
in a -- in an apartment, and as 
I told you, then we went to k -- 
Salonika, and after the few years 
we moved to Kavála, and we had our hom
e in Bucephalus, or Bucephalus Street. 
Q: Do you reme mber the actual a
ddress of the home , the number? 
A: I think it was number 10, I™m not sure. 

Q: And wha t  about, did you go to one partic
ular synagogue during your  childhood in Kavála? 
A: There™s only -- there was 
only one synagogue in the city. 
Q: What was the name? 

A: Beth El, as far as I can reme mber.  
Q: Okay, now are there any other sort of chil
dhood me mories, anythingin
 particular, any fond 
me mories, anything that real
ly stands out for you when you think of your childhood? 
A: In 1935 or 1933, I™m not sure about it, there wa
s a revolution in Greece, where part of them 
and their -- the Prime Minister Venizelos was demo
cratic and part of them was Roya list. Kavála 
choose part of the demo cratic pa
rt of it, and the Royalists won 
the civil war, they bombed the 
city and they destroyed our syna
gogue. What I reme mber is that
 after 1935 or ™36, when there 
was a dictatorship in Greece and this Metaxas, 
my uncle kiv -- came from Salonika and rebuilt 
the synagogue. 
Q: What was your uncle™s name? 

A: My uncle™s name  was  Maurice Ashkenazi. 
He -- he was my mother™s first cousin. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0515

Q: So how did the synagogue get destr
oyed, it was intentional to destroy -- 
A: No, no it -- Kavála was bombed, and part of
 the bombs de stroyed the synagogue. Was not 
intentional. 
Q: So were your parents 
involved or active in any 
political organizations? 
A: Not Greek political organizations. They were
 involved very much in
 Zionist organizations. 
Q: Any in particular, the name s of them, that you reme mber? 

A: Not exactly. I just  remember [speaks Greek 
here] because my father represented them in 
Kavála and used to raise money, funds for 
them. I don™tremember 
another organization. 
Q: And then were you active already as a, I don™
t know, teenager, or even before?  Wh en did you 
-- did you get active with a Zi
onist organization as well? 
A: Well, not til after the war. At the age of 18 I we
nt to Athens at the university and then the war 
came, th-the German occ upation came and everything was -- 

Q: And also I just wanted to find out, the co
mmunity, the Jewi sh community in Kavála, was it 
entirely Sephardic or  a combination? 

A: Entirely Sephardic. 

Q: And your -- you kept kosher at home ?  

A: Yes, we did. 

Q: Okay. So now, before you actually left for At
hens, just to think about the year 1933 when 
Hitler and the Nazis came to power
, did you know anything about this
?  You were still in Kavála, 
and how old were you at this time? 

A: Are you talking about 1933?  I was 12 years old. 

Q: Did you hear anything, orwere your parents talking? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0515  
8 
 
 
A: Yes, we knew everything in Greece. As a ma tter 
of fact, most of the Gr
eeks were against it -- 
against Germany, and a gainst the dic-
dictatorship, especially my cit
y, that even in 1933, as far as 
I can reme mber, had a Co mmunist mayor. 
Q: So what do you reme mber?  What were some  of your earliest impressions, what you heard at 

that time? 

A: Everything that was happening to the Jews 
in Germany, and we were very much worried 

about it.  

Q: And did you hear a fe w years later, in 
1938, did you hear anything 
about Kristallnacht? 
A: Yes, we knew about everything, and more or
 less we were ready, because we knew that 
Greek™s turn was comi ng, that one way or the other, we™ll be invaded. 

Q: How did you get the infor mation? Wa s it th
rough radio, or how were you learning things? 
A: Through radio, through free news
papers, through contacts with the outside. We  we re free to 
vo -- to -- to travel , where there were no restrictio
ns at all. We  were free people, and we ™re very 
happy people. We  had also a ki -- a king who is 
so pro-Jewish. And the -- the governme nt nek -- 
never took any measures against 
the Jews or ma de any discrimi nation. As a ma tter of fact, we 
had at the Greek congress, a Jewish repr
esentative, and also 
a Jewish senator. 
Q: But you did feel some concern that ma ybe 
some of these anti-Jewish measures mi ght 
eventually come  to Greece. Did your fa mily
 ever talk about wanting to leave Greece? 

A: No, we never thought of leaving Greece, except
 1938, when we decided to come  to the United 
States. But as I told you before, we were aware 
what™s happening all around the world, we were 
very much worried about the pr oblems in Palest
ine where the Arabs has revolted against England 
and against the Jews. We  knew what was happening the Jews of -- of Germany, and we had 

decided at  the time maybe it was time to come to th
e States. What did happen is that we got our 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0515  
9 
 
 
quota for our -- or our visa to come  to the United 
States 1939, and at that time the war had started 
already, so we coul
dn™t move any more. 
Q: So tell me  about when exactly did you go to Athens to study? 

A: I went to Athens in October 1939. 

Q: So this is after the war began? 

A: No, it was before the war. Th
e war in Greece started in 1940. 
Q: I-I™m sorry, I wanted to just 
talk about for a mome nt, just th
e beginning of World War II with 
Poland. 

A: They just -- the war ha
d started in Poland already. 
Q: And wha t  did you hear and what did you know about that? 

A: Now we were always talking 
and were always very, very en
thusiastic and hopeful that the 
French and the British would take good care of the Germans. 

Q: So then it™s October, you sai
d, of ™39 when you left for Athens? 
A: Yes. 

Q: And tell me  what you were going off to Athens to do? 

A: I was studying me dicine. I was in the first year 
of me dicine, at the ye --
 University of Athens. 
Q: And wha t  was that experience like?  Did you ma
ke a lot of friends again, mostly Jewish, or 
non-Jewish? 

A: Like everybody else, I was very happy about it. 
I was grateful that my parents could afford 
the e -- the expense to send me  ther
e. I had no qualms  about my future. 
Q: Did you know what kind of doctor you wanted to be? 

A: No. The first year the main thing that we
 learned was anatomy and chemistry. It was a 
preliminary for the me dical profession. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0515  
10 
 
 
Q: And did you ha -- were there other Jewi
sh students with you at me dical school? 
A: There was only one Jewish student with 
me at medical stool -- school. The name was 
Mittrani, and she was killed during the German
 occupation up in the Greek mountains, as a 
partisan. 
Q: And while you were in Athens did you -- was there any anti-Semitism there? 

A: Nothing at all. Nothing at all. What it wa
s was a fear of the Greek -- of the war that was 
comi ng very close to Greece. As a ma tter 
of fact, the year after, 1940, October 28
th
, 1940, the 
Italians attacked Greece. Greek 
defended -- Greece defended itself
, and to a certain extent we 
were able to win against the It
alians. That prompted Germany, 
in April of 1941 to conquer the 
whole of the [indecipherable]. And 
how you call -- and occupy Greece.  
Q: So what was -- what were you seeing and experi
encing directly about a
ll of this in Athens? 
A: In Athens, nothing. We were
 very happy, and we thought it™ll never happen. As a ma tter of 
fact, it™s well known historically
 that the night before the Ita
lians attacked Greece, there was a 
big party given by the Greek governme nt where the 
ge -- the Italian ambassador was part of the 
crowd.  

Q: But you were still in Athens, I believe, when
 -- did the Germans come  into Athens, or -- 
A: No. I left Athens in 1940 with -- when the wa
r started against the Italians. The Germans ca me  

to Greece in 1941, six months late
r. The university was closed, there was no reason for me  to 
stay in Athens. 

Q: I actua lly thought that you had stayed in 
Athens until the Germans came, but you didn™t. 
A: No, I did not. 

Q: So you -- you had chosen -- the school ha
d not yet closed, but you chose to leave? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0515  
11 
 
 
A: No, the school closed as soon as the Italians
 attacked, because almost everybody went to the 
army, were drafted. 

Q: And you were not? 

A: No, I was not drafted, I was too young. To be 
drafted in Greece you have  to be 21 years old, 
and at that time I was ha rdly 20.  

Q: So tell me  what it was like when you return
ed. At that time did you return to Kavála? 
A: Yes. Everybody was afraid, everybody was maki
ng plans, and everybody was trying more or 
less, to save his famil
y, to stay together.  

Q: So what happened next?  You returned to 
Kavála and then what happened after that? 
A: After that the Germans came in, and we figure th
at Kavála was a very small city, we mi ght as 
well go to Sa lonika and 
we went to Salonika. 
Q: You made that decision after the Germans came in? 

A: My father ma de the decision, yes, after the 
Germans ca me . In 19 -- in April 1941 we went to 
Salonika. Salonika was occupi
ed by the Germans already. 
Q: And wha t  about -- had Kavála 
been occupied by the Germans? 
A: We ll, the Germans di vided Greece in three parts.
 Part of gre -- of Greece, the southern part 
was given to the Italians. The northern part of wa
s kept for the Germans and the part of the north 
of Greece that was an exit to medi -- t-to the Me
diterranean was given to the Bulgarians, who at 
the time s we re allied with the Germans. That was one of the reasons that everybug -- bu -- one 

who could leave Kavála, left, because we were 
afraid to stay under the bulger -- Bulgarian 
governme nt. 

Q: Why?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0515  
12 
 
 
A: Because there was an experience from World Wa
r I that the Bulgarians had occupied the city, 
and th-the -- i-it was only torture and -- and -- 
and fear, and [indecipherabl
e] killing people. So 
everyone who had an experience from before -- not 
us, before, in ™21 we we
re not in Kavála, was 
telling us what it means to be under the Bu
lgars. So we decided to go to Sa lonika. 
Q: So at that time you actually thought it ma y 
have been better to be under the Germans? 
A: We  figured at the time we™d muc h better to be in
 the Greeks -- in the big city so we™d be mor e  
protected. 
Q: And that was not just a fear 
of what the Bulgarians mi ght do to
 the Jews, that was the general 
population™s fear? 

A: No, no that was the fear that the Bulgarians 
insisted that this part
 of Macedonia belonged to 
them, and we shoul -- we shouldn™t be Greeks, 
we shouldn™t speak Greek, we shouldn™t have our 
own associations. We  should turn around and more 
or less be like a -- like 
a secret police, and 
denounce our fr -- our Greek friends. 
That we were not ready to do.  
Q: So describe to me  what it was like when 
you arrived to Salonika and where did you live? 
A: We  rented an apartment next to my uncle, a
nd my father started from scratch all over again, 

doing his business with the tobacco pe ople. 

Q: And whe n was this that you ma de the move? 

A: We  ma de  the move in the end of April 1941. 

Q: And it was possible at that time for you to 
move around and do these things on your own? 
A: Yes, it was just the beginning of the occupatio
n, moving was still free. I 
think the restrictions 
came some time in June of ™41, but don™t quote me , I™m not sure about the date. 

Q: So in Salonika, tell me  a 
little bit about the neighborhood th
ere, was it a mostly Jewish 
neighborhood? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0515  
13 
 
 
A: Was mostly Jewish. 
Q: And can you give me  a sense of the si
ze of the Jewish comm
unity in Salonika? 
A: We ll, I think at the time were about 70,000 Jews
. It was a big community and more or less we 
had our own neighborhoods without being a ghe
tto. We  were free to move , we had Greek 
Orthodox living with us, but mostly were Jewish. 

Q: And do you reme mbe r  the street where you lived? 

A: Yes, the name  of the street was, street Saron 
de Poru 18, was exactly i-in front of the Salonika 
Jewish community. 

Q: Yes. And what part of the -- is there a name  to 
this district or part of Salonika that you lived 
in? 

A: Right now, I wouldn™t know.  

Q: At that time ?  

A: At that time  nobody t ouched it 
til the deportati
ons started. 
Q: So, what were the very first things that 
you were aware of that the Germans were doing in 
Salonika and specifically, you know, 
anti-Jewish meas -- measures. 
A: Re-Restriction of traveling. Taxes that we co
uldn™t afford, restrictions
 in business, and the 
most important, some thing that even today I ca
nnot explain, there were about 150 German Jews 
that™s came to Salonika at the expense of the 
Jewish community that took over the functioning of 
the community, where the comm
unity council was jailed.  
Q: Sorry, what was the 
last thing you said? 
A: Wa s the elected Jewish community council 
was jailed the t -- by the 
Germans, including the 
chief rabbi.  

Q: You™re saying these were Germa n Jews
 who already were living in Sa lonika? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0515  
14 
 
 
A: No, these were German Jews that came in Sal
onika after the German o
ccupation and I still in 
my mi nd say they were not Jewish, or they were 
part of a -- I don™t know what, because we were 
forced to ma intain them, to feed them, and wh
en the deportations started, they were the shupos, 
the -- the Jewish -- 
Q: Jewish police? 

A: Jewish police that the German imposed. 

Q: Wa -- 

A: They -- they didn™t tou 
-- they did not touch them. 
Q: What was the name? Was there one?

Beginning Ta pe One, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holoca ust Memorial Museum interview with Nick 
Levi. This is tape number one, side B. Just want 
to continue to find out a little bit more from you 
about your family™s financial situation. How -- were you well off as a family? 

A: We  was well off in [indecipherable]. My 
father had two associates who were Greek 
Orthodox, and one of them was very, very influe
ntial in the local govern
me nt. As a ma tter of 
fact, in 1941, when the Germans were ready to 
attack Greece, my father was able, with his 
associates, to rent a ship and transfer all our a
ssets to Athens because we were sure that if 
some thing happens ther e, Athens will not be t
ouched, will not be bombed. So our luck was that 
when the boat arrived in Piraeu
s -- the name  of the boat Stilian
i -- Piraeus was bombed, the boat 
was sunk. All our asset were de
stroyed. We  had insurance w
ith Lloyd of London, however the 
insurance was in Greek dol -- mon -- drachma s. 
So after the war, one billion Greek drachma 

wasn™t even worth an dollar. So we lost everything. 
Q: When wa s this that this ship
 was taken with all your assets? 
A: In April 1941, when the gi -- Germans attack
ed Greece, they bombed the port of Piraeus, 
because it wa s an expeditionary force of British, w
ho had come  to help -- to help the Greeks. As 
a ma tter of fact their stand was 
in Thermopylae and then they did [indecipherable] into Crete, 
and from Cr ete, when they lost Crete, they we
nt back to [indecipherable]. So the Germans were 
bombing all the ports of Greece at the time, and 
our luck, which ship ha d to be sunk there. 
Q: Is this a ve ry unusual story?  Do you know
 other families who did anything like this? 
A: No, it™s very, very unusual, be
cause at that time to get a ship
 was mor e  than [indecipherable], 
it was influence, and you know, having people help you. 

Q: So this was actually a ship full of money, your money? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0515  
16 
 
 
A: This was a ship with all our assets. In other 
words, all the me rchandise that we had in Kavála, 
we transferred to Athens and we were left wit
hout anything. That™s why it
™s said when we went 
to Salonika, my father had to start fr
om scratch because we were penniless. 
Q: Do you reme mber this being a very difficult time?  

A: Very. Very difficult because at that time is
 -- the only business in Greece was the bl ack 
ma rket. There was no food, there were no utilities, 
and everybody had to fend itself, and we used 
to live on coupons. But my father had ma ny acquainta
nces from the past and 
he was able to start 
his business all over again. 

Q: And he was doing the same  kind of business in Salonika? 

A: Exactly the same  bus iness. 

Q: So, I asked you this a little bit before, but 
I was wondering if you reme mber more details 
about the very earliest measures
 that the Germans took. You said
 there were restrictions on 
business. If you reme mb er any details -- 
A: As soon as they came, there were restrictions  on business, and restric
tions in traveling, about 
two months after they came . In 1942, they st
arted giving -- imposing 
taxes to the Jewish 
community that was very hard to be kept -- to 
be. And then, on, as I told
 you, in July or August 
1942, we had the concentration at the Liberty Pl a
ce, where people were cheated -- were t -- was, 
you know, t -- tortured, and most of
 the yonkers -- youngsters were taken for hard works in the 
south of -- of Greece, and were separated from their families. 

Q: Can you -- can you wa lk me  through a little bit more
 of the details of that incident, because it 
is a -- a well known incident, and I want to 
know your me mories. What do you first reme mber?  
Were you told that you had to go to this -- this place? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0515  
17 
 
 
A: I didn™t have to go personally. 
The people that I knew, my cous
ins, my parents, my friends, 
had to go on a Saturday morning in this particular
 place, called Liberty Pl
ace, stand in the sun in 
August, for a whole day, beaten and humilia
ted, segregated, and then sent  back home. 
Q: And how -- why was it that you did not have to go that day? 
A: Number one because of my age, and number 
two because as a Spanish citizen, I wa s neutral, 
and supposedly the Germans expected our neutrality. 

Q: We ll, first of all, can you tell 
me  what your age was at that time ?  
A: 1941, I was 20 years o -- no, that was 1942, I was 21 years old. 

Q: And wha t  were the -- so you said that the ag
es of the me n who were 
brought there, what was 
the ages? 

A: The ages was from 21 to 50.  

Q: I just want to back up a mo ment, because you referred to being a Spanish citizen. 

A: Yes. 
Q: Can you tell me , in whatever details you reme
mber, when exactly did 
you get this citizenship? 
A: We ll, we left Spain in 1492. We
 kept our citizenship since the
n. One of my relatives -- and I 
don™t want to brag about it, happened to be Don Is
aac Abrava nel. He kept  his citizenship, he left 
Spain, he kept on being represen
tative of the Spanish governme nt, even during the Inquisition. 
And through him we kept our citi
zenship til we came  to the United States. I came to the United 
States with a Spanish passport, and I changed 
my citizenship when I became an American 
citizen. 
Q: So does that mean that both of your parents, 
as well as you, were always Spanish citizens in 
Greece? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0515  
18 
 
 
A: My parents wer -- yes, both my pa rents, by 
ma rriage, were Spanish citizen. My father was 
Spanish citizen, my mother was -- Ashkenazi was one
 of the part of Jews 
that came 600 early -- 
600 years earlier to Salonika from Poland, and they kept the name  Ashkenazi to distinguish 
themselves from Sephar di.  

Q: So -- so your mother was not Sephardic? 

A: No, wa -- my mother was 
Sephardic, after 600 years.  
Q: S -- and -- and so your -- your citizenship, you
 were never Greek citizens, is that right? 
A: Sure. No, I was always a Spanish citizen. I 
had the right to choose a citizenship when I 
became 21, but at that time , Greek was o -- Gr
eece was occupied already by the Germans. 
Q: So you were born with Spanish citizenship? 

A: I was born Spanish citizen, and I be -- it was 
always Spanish citizen all my life, til I change 
my citizenship when I came to the United 
States and became a u -- a U.S. citizen. 
Q: I was just wondering if you can explain, sin
ce it™s hard for me  to understand, was there a 
reason that your parents knew 
all al ong that they wanted to keep Spanish citizenship? 
A: No, a fa mily tradition. Just a fa mily tradition. 

Q: Even though they felt very Greek, I would imagine. 

A: Oh yeah, oh yeah. They knew nothing about Spain, except the language. 

Q: And can you tell me , and anyone else who mi ght
 listen to this, a littl
e bit more about this 
fa mous Abr a nel? 

A: The Spanish what? 

Q: Abra -- Abravanel?  I™m sorr
y, I ma y not pronounce it correctly. 
A: Okay, a little bit of history. When Isabel
la and Ferdinand conquered Spain, they had two 
councilors that were Jewish. One was Hasdai ben Shiprut and one was Don Isaac Abravanel. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0515  
19 
 
 
They were very high on the ca -- ca -- in the Span
ish government and they were very appreciated 
by the kings. From this too, isibi -- Isaac -- Hasdai
 ben Shiprut decided to convert and stay with 
Spain. Isaac Abravanel decided to le
ave the country. He didn't want to
 convert, he didn™t want to 
live under the Inquisi tion. So Isaac Abravanel up 
til today is be ing honored by the whole Jewish 
community, where the name  of Hasd
a i  Shiprut almost disappeared.  
Q: And your -- was it on your fath
er™s side or mother™s side? 
A: My father™s side. 
Q: And this is some thing that was long esta
blished, so nobody needed to
 prove the relations? 
A: No, not at all. Wa s ne ver questioned. As a ma t ter of fact [indecipherable] documents from the 

Cortez, the Spanish congress, signed by the king of 
Spains, testify the citizenship of my father.  
Q: So now we go back to 1942, Liberty Square, I 
believe  you were telling me about this, and was 
your -- was it obvious -- when di
d it become  obvious that your 
Spanish citizenship mi ght help 
you? 
A: From the  beginning, that is, the Ge rmans en
tered Greece, they always ma de a difference 
between the Italian citizens, and the Spanishcitizen and the Turkish citizens because the 
[indecipherable] neutral and the It
alians were allies. So the Italian citizens, the Spanish citizen 
and the Turkish citizens were 
not touched at all. But -- 
Q: So -- 

A: -- but we still couldn™t trav
el, and we still couldn™t choose 
our own profession or our own 
status.  

Q: Wa s your father™s busine
ss interrupted by the German™s
 measures at that time ?  
A: We ll, my  father™s si -- business started a
ll over again after the 
occupation. We  had lost 
everything with the sinking of the boat.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0515  
20 
 
 
Q: But was he still able to work when the Germans were there? 
A: Well, his bi -- hi s business was privilege for 
the Germans because they were stealing all the 
tobacco from Greece, and sending them to gr -- to 
Germany for -- for free, and my father was the 
business that provided the materials to 
[indecipherable] and export the tobacco. 
Q: So he was able to continue his business? 

A: Yeah, he continued til 1943, that we were deported. 

Q: What were some  of t he things you saw about
 other Jewish fa milies who could not continue 

working?  What did you see happening around you? 

A: Their hardships, that they have what to ea
t, they couldn't move, th
ey couldn™t congregate. 
They were sl aves that were in -- th-t
hat were occupied, they were not free. 
Q: And they had to give up their jobs? 

A: Most of them had to give their jobs, yes. 
Have to give their jobs
, and the Germans took all 
their proceed -- all their me rchandise and everyt
hing they had. It was a terrible situation. 
Q: Did you -- so tell me , since you did not have to go to the Li berty Square, tell me  what you 

learned from -- you said -- did your fa
ther go, and what about your uncle? 

A: My father didn™t go, my uncle
 was too old, my cousins we nt. 
Q: And wha t  did they tell
 you about their experience? 
A: They didn™t have to tell it because we were
 in the mi ddle of a cit
y, we saw it happening. 
Q: You saw the gather -- the round-up? 

A: Yes. We  saw everything that happened. 

Q: So that day you were some where close by, but you 
didn™t have to be part of it. Wa s that -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0515  
21 
 
 
A: We ll, I was not part of it, and I was part of 
it, because personally I was not, but family-wise, 
my whole fa mily was part of it. There was no di
stinction. The citizenship
 was, how you call that? 
[indecipherable] some thing happen. We didn™t choose it. 

Q: And wha t  happened to your cousins?  We re they taken away? 

A: Well, they all re --  perished in Auschwitz, 
from the first to the last one, and my uncle. 
Q: Now, I read about -- when this roundup occu rred, I read about the fact that the Germans 

requested a large sum of money as
 ransom. Can you explain this? 
A: I don™t reme m -- I don™t remembe r  how many bill
ions of marks they requested at the time. 
Q: Can you tell me  a little bit from th
e start what -- what that was about? 
A: We ll, what was about, it™s one way you oppre
ss the Jewish population, because they thought 
they wouldn™t be able 
to make their demands. 
Q: We ll, what was the ransom for?  What 
were they saying to the Jewish community? 
A: No explanation. No explanation at all. They
 needed the money, they should raise the money 
for them, pe riod. 

Q: Wa s this supposed to, in return, save some  
of the me n from being se
nt to labor battalions? 
A: That was in a way thought, but right away they
 started with the -- the extreme measures, with 
putting the[indecipherable] on th
e Jews. By movi ng the whole population into ghettos, and a few 
months later, in March, 
the deportations started. 
Q: We ll, before we get to that stage, about th
e ransom, I also read some thing about the Jewish 
cemetery in Salonika. Do you reme mber
 what happened with the cemetery? 
A: That was completely different. The Germans said that  they needed material s to fortify the 

city. And being that the German -- the Jewish ce
metery was full of marble, and good materials -- 
was a cemetery that was six or 700 
years old, they decided that they
 needed the ma terials. They 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0515  
22 
 
 
contacted the Greek government that was -- at th
e time was at quixli -- a quisling governme nt. 
And the governme nt said that the f -- you de
stroy the cemetery, will be a good favor for us 
because we can expand our university. And this 
is what happened. Today, where the Je wish 
cemetery was, is the University of Salonika. 
Q: Did you see the destruction of the cemetery at that time? 

A: I saw the destruction of the cemetery and I wa
s part of it in a way, because they gave the 
Jewish community a small pl ace for a cemetery outsi
de the city, and the people that could afford 
to do it, had to move the remains of their relatives to the new cemetery. Part of my family 

contributed into removing the rema ins of my gr
andmother from this cemetery to the new one, 
and the graves at the time was meant to have si
x people, six rema in of pe ople in one grave. My 
grandmother is still buried on th
e new ce me tery in Salonika. 
Q: And I had read, but it sounds like you™re sayi
ng it was not connected, 
I had read that the 
destruction of that cemetery was related 
to the ransom that the Germans wanted. 
A: It happened way after the ransom. The loot that
 they took from the ce metery was not part of 
the money that we told to -- to raise and pay th
e Germans. Com- completely different. It was not 
even at the same ti me, was later.  

Q: Now, I also read and was wondering if you were 
aware of this at the time, the Jewish archives 
and libraries in Salonika we
re confiscated, were taken. 
A: I don™t reme mber that. [indecipherable] 
it™s true, but I don™t know when was it. 
Q: And I also heard about the th
reat of starvation and ma ny peopl
e were -- were suffering a great 
deal. 

A: The -- the starvation was general. Wa s not just
 the Jewish. As I told you, we had coupons in 
order to ge t certain amount of food every week
 and quite a few fa milies, Jewish and Orthodox, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0515  
23 
 
 
no distinction there, chos
e ma ny ti me s not to report a death, to go to the cemetery and drop there 
the corpse, in order to save the coupon, so they 
can have some  extra measure of food. To tell the 

truth, I mean, you cannot describe 
what was happen, but this was not just the Jews, was general. 
Was the whole population. 

Q: And -- and why had these conditions 
come  about?  How did they come  about? 
A: Lack of imports, lack of commerc e , lack of 
cultivation, bef -- por -- people were afraid to go 
to the -- to the fields. Lack of 
fear. The -- the partisan
s [indecipherable] if
 you left the city you 
expose yourself, because they were 
there to -- to hit and kill as ma
ny Jews as they could -- that™s 
ma ny Ger mans as they could. There were ma ny, 
ma ny, many reasons for it. I could keep on 
enumerating to you an awful lot of reasons why the population was starving.  

Q: Now, you me ntioned partisans, we re you 
contact with, or did you know any partisans? 
A: Wa s in contact with parti -- no. We knew 
about them, but personally I didn™t know any. I 
knew my fri e nd that I told you were in me dical sc
hool, who went to the m
ountains as a partisan 
and was killed there.  

Q: And the ransom that was required fro -- by 
the Germans, did your family have to pay 
anything personally? 

A: We  participated, but we did not
 have to. After all, we werenot Spaniards, we were Jewish. 

Q: What was your -- at -- at th
is stage, before you are taken 
and moved, as I understand, to the 
ghetto, which we™ll come  to, but at this
 stage, what was your daily life like? 
A: As Spanish citizens, we did not have to move
 to the ghetto. What happened is that where we 
lived became part of the ghetto, bu
t we did not have to move. We  
kept our apartment, we did not 
move at all.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0515  
24 
 
 
Q: We ll, before that happened, what were
 you doing?  You were a young ma n, but you were 
already over 20, what were you doing on a daily basis? 
A: I had a business with a friend of mi ne who 
was also a Spanish citizen, name  is Zaga Tenyo, 
who used to produce -- 

Q: Some  drinks, tea? 

A: Dri -- drinks. And the name  of the factory we
 had was called Olympic.
 There was drinks in 
envelopes that we used to sell. 

Q: And this is some thing -- 

A: Soft drinks. 

Q: And this is some thing that was going pret
ty well, considering the circumstances, or -- 
A: Considering the circumstances, it was doing very well. 

Q: And had you already -- were you hoping someday 
to go back to me dical school?  What was 
your state of mi nd like? 
A: Yes, definitely, definitely. 
I was thinking to continue my 
studies, but it couldn™t happen, 
because when it ca -- when I was ready to go to 
school, I was already 30 years old. I ha d lost 10 
years, between the concentration camp, going to
 Morocco, going to [indecipherable], going to 
the Israeli army. 1939 becam
e automatically 1949.  
Q: Now, before the ghetto was establishe
d, what -- what do you reme mbe r?  We re there 
increasing measures, you know, th -- against the Jews
, and when -- when is this now, what year 
and approxima tely what month? 
A: We ™re talking about ninet -- beginning of
 ™42, and beginning of 1943. The Jews could not 
move into their own city, could not travel, coul
d not work. At night they had to go back, they 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0515  
25 
 
 
couldn™t go out at night. They c
ouldn™t even go from one borough to the other because they were 
prohibited to take the tramways.  
Q: Did this apply to you or not? 

A: No, this did not apply to me , I never wore 
a [indecipherable]. I was never told to live in a 
ghetto. I happened to live in a ghetto because th
at™s where I lived when they establishe d the 
ghetto. 

Q: So -- so you were saying you ne
ver had to wear the yellow star? 
A: No. 

Q: And then neither di
d your parents, right? 
A: Neither my parents. That™s 
why we were able to take the 
bus and to take the tra -- the 
tramway, because nobody could distinguish us as Jews unless they knew us from before. 

Q: So tell me  about what you reme mber in any sort of details when the ghetto was created. 

A: I don™t know. What I reme mber is that they cr
eated the ghetto, they were the conquerors, and 
they created the Jewish police to more or less
 supervise any [indecipherable] that the Germans 
had imposed and also in a way, take care of -- so
 there™d be no crime. Actually, we were a 
population very pacific. We never 
rioted, we never stole from our 
-- from one to the other. We  
live pacifi cally there, waiting to
 see what™s going to happen. 

Q: Did you have interactions with the Jewish police? 

A: Yeah, we were all Jewish. 

Q: No, I mean did you personally have any, 
you know, communication or 
interactions with 
Jewish police? 

A: Yes. My cousins were Jewish police. 

Q: We ll, they probably treated you we
ll because they were your cousins. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0515  
26 
 
 
A: They didn™t have to treat me , I was free,
 as a Spaniard. I was not treated as a Jew. 
Q: So was there anything throughout this period of time -- 

A: And -- let me  explain some thing more. The reason that many people paid money and tried to 

become  Jewish police, because there was a rumo
r flooded by the Germans that the Jewish police 
will not be  touched, will rema in where they were, and will not be deported. So people were 

[indecipherable] were fighting 
to became  Jewish police. 
Q: How did your cousins become  th -- Jewish police? 

A: I don™t know. 

Q: And wha t  were their name s?  

A: My great cousin was David, my s econd one 
was Solomon, the third one was Henry, and I 
don™t reme mber the name  of the fourth one. This
 was on my uncle™s side
. On my aunt™s side, 
there was only one that was her -- his 
name  was Maurice -- Maurice Seedis. 
Q: So none of the -- none of the restricti
ons applied to you at -- at this stage. 
A: No. 

Q: And yet, just by virtue of where you were 
already living, you were 
included in the ghetto. 
A: Wa s include in the ghetto because we 
happened to be there, and we were there 
[indecipherable] Jewish because a
ll the [indecipherable] fami ly wa
s part of our life. We were 
living with them. 

Q: So did your -- did anything change about 
your living conditions onc
e this became a ghetto? 
A: We ll, the salvation wa s there, as I though it wa s 
part of the Jewish life and the Christian life. 
The traveling fr om one city to the other was not permitted. Traveling at night we were afraid. We 

tried to help as much we could our Jewish fa milies and the whole Jewish co mmunity, and -- 

Q: Wa s there -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0515  
27 
 
 
A: -- [indecipherable] period. 
Q: -- was there anything -- so you we re able to
 help others who -- you know, did not have the 
Spanish citizenship? 

A: We were able to help them money-wise be
cause both my friend and myself continued in our 

business of the so -- of 
the soft git -- drinks. 
Q: So what did you see -- what 
was changing around this time , if 
anything, for the other Jewish 
fa milies, once they were in the ghetto? 

A: [indecipherable] what can 
I say -- tell you. Wh at was chan
ging was the fear, period.  
Q: And were you also fearful, or were you f
eeling that, with your ci
tizenship you would be 
okay? 

A: No, there was no guarantee, as a ma tter of fac t
, even with the citizenship, fi nally we were 

deported. 

Q: Wa s that some thing you were
 worried about at that time? 
A: Yes, everybody worried about it.  
Q: When did you first hear a
bout -- the -- the first deportati
ons, when -- do you reme mber 
hearing about those? 

A: First deportation was in 
March 1943, I think it was the 23
rd
 of March.  
Q: And you knew about it right away? 

A: We  knew about it because we saw people pi -- 
taken from the ghetto and sent to the railroad 
station in order to be deported. It was not a secret.  

Q: The -- if you can explain to me
 -- cause I looked at a map a
nd it looked like it™
s not just one 
area that was a ghetto, that was 
in a fe w different sections. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0515  
28 
 
 
A: There -- there were five ghettos and each ghetto 
went to the railroad station one at a time and 
some ti me s half of the time  becau
se there were 23 deportations.  
Q: Is there a name  to the s
ection, the district you were in? 
A: No. 
Q: And were you close by to -- 
End of Tape One, Side B 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0515  
29 
 
 
Beginning Ta pe Two, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holoca ust Memorial Museum interview with Nick 
Levi. This is tape number two, side A. You wer e  
just telling me  about th
is situation with the 
partisans and the Germans. Can you tell me  again? 

A: We ll, the situation in Greece,
 like every occupi ed country, 
people were against the Germans 
and most of them beca me partisans in the 
mountains. When the Germans had to travel by 
railroad, they used to brought -- put in front of the locomotive, 
a wagon with Greek hostages, just 
in case there was a bomb in the railroad tracks, so
 the wagon of the Jewish -- of the hostages will 
be blown up, and not the Germans. Also, when they had any skirmi shes with the partisans, and 

one of two Germans we re killed, in the morning of 
the [indecipherable] they used to have lorries, 
and [indecipherable] the city, and pick up for 
every German that was killed, six people that 
peacefully will go into work in th
e morning, and execute them. So, it™s impossible to describe  the 
fear we lived in, regardless of citizenship. When 
they picked up cit -- when
 picked up hostages, 
they didn't ask you what citizenship, they didn™t as
k if you were Jewish, y
ou™re just one of the 
hostages, period. 

Q: Did this happen to anyone you knew? 

A: Yes, quite a few of my friends were
 killed this way, were executed this way. 
Q: And were any of the non-Jewish Greek popul
ation able to help Jews at this time? 
A: It was impossible. The only h-help they could give
 to us, it™s either to 
hide a Jew, or to take 
their belongings and hide them, hopefully to give 
them back to them when they come  back, after 
the war. That™s the only thing they could do for us. 

Q: And did you know of situations like that? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0515  
30 
 
 
A: Yes, I know a situation like 
that, where quite [indecipherable]
 precious things were given 
away to Greek friends, who unfort
unately, after the war, they didn™
t -- not all of them gave them 
back to the Je ws. Most of them had a  fa mous saying; I™m sorry they didn™t kill you too. So they 
were [indecipherable] not anti-Semitics, but they
 were humans. Whatever
 they could loot and 
keep, they kept. Maybe we™re Jews who w
ould have done the same  thing. Who knows? 
Q: Did you ever i -- di d you ever experien
ce anti-Semitism from the Greek population?  
A: No, not even today. As I told
 you, I still correspond w
ith Greek friends that
, as in Athens, or 
in Salonika were very good frie
nds, and we keep in touch with
 their fami l i es and with our 
fa mily. 

Q: Now, while you were still living in your hom
e , were you able to continue observing, you 
know, holidays and did -- wer -- were 
you able to go to synagogue any more? 
A: No. The synagogues were closed
 and occupied. Most of them 
beca me  stables of the German 
army. We  c ould not, of course, bake
 ma tzohs or things like that fo
r Passover. We  ke pt it quiet in 
the house, we  used to do our prayers, and that™s it. 

Q: Can you tell me  a little bit more about, and did 
you ever ha ve any interaction at all with this -- 
with this Rabbi Koretz? 

A: No, I never did. 

Q: Did you have strong feelings about his role? 

A: Yes, I do, but I keep them for mys e lf. 

Q: And wha t  about the Germans, di d you have a
ny interactions with th
e Germans oc cupying at 
that time? 

A: I had interaction with the Germ
ans that were sent to us from
 Ger many, the 150 people I told 
you before, because they were part of the shupos
, and they used to interfere with our lives.

Q: In what ways? 
A: In all ways. We  were not free. We had to do what they told us to do. 

Q: So -- and that was usually comi ng from the German Jews, not from t he -- the Germans in 

charge? 

A: From the  German Je ws. You know, it™s a fu
nny thing. The Germans s e nt to Salonika six 
people, only six people. And these six people recr
uited the Jewish police,
 and the 150 people that 
come  th -- came there before, and did the whol
e job of deporting close to 100,000 people, just 

with six of them. It™s fantastic, the way they were organized. 

Q: Did you ever see the six who were in charge? 

A: Yes, we saw them, th ey circulate. As a ma tte
r of fact, was a fat one 
name d Vincent -- Vincent 
Cheni, who after the war was executed. 

Q: Did you know the name s of the others at the time ?  

A: No, I™m a fraid I don™t. If I knew them, I don™t reme mber them. 
Q: So now, back to the deporta
tions. When -- when these bega
n, what else were you seeing?  
What -- what -- were the peopl
e immediately around you being ta
ken, or was it different groups 
of people?   
A: They were taken in groups of people, and wh
en the time  c a me  for the people around me , they 
were taken like all the othe
rs. There were no exception. 
Q: So, at that time that the people around you we
re taken, you were taken with them, as well? 
A: No. We  were not touc hed, because  we didn™t 
wear the [indecipherable] and we were Spanish. 
We were left in our apartment 
without being touched at all. 

Q: So do you reme mber when the peopl
e in your section were deported? 
A: That mus t  have been some ti me  be
fore Passover, between April and May, 1943. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0515  
32 
 
 
Q: What were you hearing and what were -- what
 was everybody being told as to where these 
deportations were going? 
A: They were told to bring the mone y with them, to exchange the money to zlotys because they 

were going to Poland, where Germany had decide
d to establish a Jewish state and were 

concentrating all the Jews of Europe there. A
nd people believed in that because the Chief Rabbi 
was the fi rst one to disseminate the -- the rumo
r, and they were going like sheep to the new 
place, where they go -- we re going 
to have a Jewish state.  
Q: Were they told where in Poland? 

A: They didn™t say the location. 
I th -- I think they me ntioned 
the word Kraków, I™m not sure 
about it. And that™s it. They gave all their m
oney, they came happy back with zlotys and then 
they were put into -- into wagons, animal
 wagons, locked there and transported.  
Q: What was your impression of -- of
 this idea? Did you believe this? 
A: I had a good friend who was the secretary of 
the Greek governor of Macedonia, who kept on 
telling me  all the time, don™t believe what they™r
e telling you, try to escape. Go away. Don™t stay 
here. I didn™t listen to him.  

Q: You -- you -- 

A: The -- the Greeks knew what was going to happen, 
but they couldn™t tell us. They were afraid 
of their own lives. 

Q: So did -- was there some  part of you that
 did believe what the Germans were saying? 

A: I believed what the Greeks were saying. I di
dn™t believe what the Germans were saying, but 
by Jewish tradition, I couldn™t l
eave my father and mother, so I had to stay with them. 
Q: Did you at all discuss with them the idea of escaping? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0515  
33 
 
 
A: Yes. We  didn™t knowabout 
the crematoria. Don™t mi sunderstand me . We didn™t know about 
the concentration camps. But we knew thatwhere they™re sending them was nothing good.  
Q: So you had not yet heard of the name  Auschwitz? 

A: We  heard the name  Auschwitz when we arri
ved at Bergen-Belsen. Whe n we arrived at the 

camp, there was a group of Polish Jews that ar
e concentrated there because they were 
Argentinean citizens. They told us what happe
n. They told us the extermination, we never 
believed them. It was impossible to believe. 

Q: So when you saw others around you being de
ported, and you were not being deported, did 
you think for awhile that you w
ould never face the deportations? 
A: We ll, we were told by the Spanish consul that
 they were ma king arrangements to take them to 
Spain. So we were looking for them, we were gi
ven passports. We  -- part of our money we gave 
to the Spanish embassy to keep for us, and we we
re waiting the day that we™ll be sent to Spain. 
Then it came in July 1943 that we were called -- ac
tually our parent s, the heads of fa milies were  
called to a -- a synagogue name d Bet h Saul in 
Salonika with instruc
tions, and instead of 
instructions, they were taken to the railroad st
ation and we were told to follow them and join 
them there. So I took my mother and myself and 
we went to this place, called Baron Hirsch, to 
join my father. 

Q: He had already been taken there earlier? 

A: No, no.  

Q: So you knew that he was going 
to be there at some  point? 
A: We  knew he was going to be there because we
 were told from the embassy to be there. But 

the thinking was that we™ll be given our pa
ssports back and we™
ll travel to Spain. 
Q: You -- you gave your passports to the Spanish embassy?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0515  
34 
 
 
A: Yes, we gave the passport to the Spanish emba
ssy. We  were deported, we were put in cattle 
wagons like all the other Jews. 
And at the end of July -- 
Q: Do you want to take a break?  You wa
nt to take -- you want some  water? 
A: If I knew this will be the -- th
e interview, I would never agreed. 
Q: I think you were starting to
 tell me  about the time when 
you were taken from Sa lonika. 
A: Yes, we™re -- 

Q: Oh -- sorry. Some thing happened to
 the recording. I think it™s okay. 
A: We  were put in cattle wa
gons like all the other Jews that
 went with us, and we were 
transferred from there to Bergen
-Belsen. It took about three weeks 
from Salonika to arrive to 
Bergen-Belsen, and of all the hardships that I reme mber and the -- and the hungers that we went 

through, one date rema ins in my mi nd, and this is the 13
th
 of August, 1943. Our convoy had 
stopped in Nuremberg, and at that time Nure mb erg ha
d a raid from the British and American af -
- air force. What I reme mber is a mi racle. The 
Germans locked the wagons, went to shelters, and 
the bombs kept on falling on the railroad sta
tion all around us, and mi r
aculously our wagon was 
not touched. August 13, 1943, and three days 
later we arrived in Bergen-Belsen. 
Q: And you had told me  earlier that y
ou believe you were something like the 22
nd
 deportation 
from Salonika? 

A: I think it was the 23
rd
 deportation from Salonika
. The very last one. 
Q: How ma ny other Greek Jews -- I guess they a
ll -- everybody had Spanish citizenship with 
you?  How ma ny were there? 

A: We  were about 300 all together.  

Q: And this was a group you already know
 -- knew ma ny of t hese individuals? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0515  
35 
 
 
A: Yeah, we were acquainted during the -- the 
German occupation. This happened ™43, and we 
knew each ot her from 1941, when we arrive d Salonika. 
Q: And the three weeks journey you 
were in -- you were alwa ys in
 the -- the train, 
the cattle car. 
A: [indecipherable] the train, locked in, yes. 

Q: What kind of f
ood were you eating? 
A: Don™t ask. The best an
s-answer is, don™t ask.  
Q: I also wanted to ask if you knew anything -- I 
-- I was reading about in the s -- back in the 
Salonika ghetto, there was a 
doctor who escaped. Wa s that so
me thing that you knew about?  His 
name -- 

A: You talking about Dr. Matarasso? 

Q: This -- I don™t know if -- this 
name  is spelled C-u-e-n-c-a. 
A: Oh, yeah, I -- for God™s sake, of course. He
 came  to the United States, he wrote a book, the 
name  of the book is Birkenau. His name  was Dr. Manashay. 
Q: Is this -- is this the same one?  I -- I r
ead about some body -- I read about this, on March 18
th
, 
that Dr. Cuenca -- C-u- e -- 
A: Doct -- Dr . Cuenca was one of the doctors of Salonika, yes. 

Q: Did you know about his escape in March of ™43, from the 
ghetto, apparently? 
A: No, I don™t. 

Q: No.  

A: I know about Dr. Manashay. 

Q: And -- and what happened with him?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0515  
36 
 
 
A: Dr. Manashay wa -- survived, came to the Unite
d States and died in 
New York. But he wrote 
a book, the book is named Birkenau, that unfa -- 
unfortunately, I gave it to some body, never 
returned it to me. 
Q: Now, when you -- when you were taken from
 Salonika, you didn't know where they were 
taking you? 

A: No, no. We knew -- we knew that we™re go
ing to Poland. We didn™t know we™re going -- 
we™re being taken to Germany. 

Q: And you no longer thought you were being taken to Spain? 

A: No, that was finish because we di
dn™t have passports, we had nothing.  
Q: And did you have the ability to 
take anything at all with you? 
A: Only what we had with
 us, period, nothing else. 
Q: You just had to walk away from y
our home and just leave everything there? 
A: That™s right. 
Q: And you never saw any of those items again? 
A: Not any more because  I didn™t go back to Greece after the war. 

Q: So, were you -- were you fa miliar with the ne
gotiations that I guess were going on a great 
deal, about the Jews like yourself with Spanish citizenship. 

A: We  heard about the negotiations after we were 
liberated from the camp. We  were told that j -- 
the Joint Distribution Committee 
was trying through the Spanish 
government, to liberate as ma ny 
Jews as possi ble. Being that our name s were 
known, because of our passports and our ci -- 
citizenship and everythi ng, we were selected as
 the ones to be taken out
 of the camp. When we 
went to the -- to germ -- to Spain, we l
earned that the whole thing was done through the 
Portuguese Red Cross, through a gentlema n who was in charge at the time, a representative of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0515  
37 
 
 
the Red Cross in Spain. His name , I think was Sa
kura, who took good care of us when we arrived 
in Spain and was responsible for taking us from
 Spain to Morocco, because the agreement with 
the Spanish governme nt was that only a certain am
ount of Jews will be allowed to stay in Spain, 
and in order to accept new Jews, they had to leave.
 And the funny part of it is that out of Spain 
we were Spanish citizens. In Spain itself, we we
re [indecipherable]. We  di dn™t s -- have a -- have 
a citizenship. We  were not recognized as Spanish. 

Q: Now, to go back to Be rgen-Belsen, what
 was it like when you -- what are your first 
impressions when you arrived? 

A: No i mpressions at all. Confused.  

Q: Well, let me just phrase it differently, the
n. If you could just tell me  what you saw when you 
first arrived. 

A: When we arrived to Celle, the city of Celle
, Bergen-Belsen™s full name  is Bergen-Belsen by 
Celle-Hannover. When we arrived 
in Celle, they took us out of 
the wagons and they ma rched us 
for about two or three kilome ters to the concentration camp. We did not know where we were 

going, we did not know the name  of t he place. All 
we saw is barbed wire, barracks and towers 
with people with machine guns, and do -- and 
fiercely dogs. When we 
got there, we was 
separated fro m the fa milies. The women went to 
different barracks, the men went to different 
barracks and that™s it, period.  

Q: We re you able to stay with your father? 

A: No -- with my father, yes,
 but not in the same  barrack. 
Q: Do you reme mber any name  or section 
that you were in in Bergen-Belsen? 
A: No. 

Q: Do you thi -- I have a ma p, do you think you™d recognize? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0515  
38 
 
 
A: Yes, I would. 
Q: Let me  s ee. I don™t know, this is fr
om ™45, I don™t know if it™s the same layout. 
A: No, we lived in 1943 -- 1944 actually. 

Q: Did it look this way? 

A: No, we were not at the crematory. The cam
p c o mmander was here. I™m trying my  best, ma ybe 
I™m wrong.  

Q: That™s fine, whatever you reme mber. 

A: No -- oh, no, no, no, no, no, now I reme mber. When 
I see the latrines, I reme mber where we 
were. The latrines were here, our barracks were 
he re. Yeah. I reme mber the cellar, where they 
used to bring the vegetabl
es that were feeding us. I reme mber the latrines, yes, yes. Our barracks 
were here. 

Q: And was there a -- a name to the section -- 

A: No. 
Q: -- that you reme mber ? 
A: No, that I can™t reme mber. 

Q: Cause I -- I read about the group of -- of Jews 
with Spanish citizenship, that they were in the 
neutrals camp. Does that ma ke sense to you? 

A: Neutrals camp?  

Q: That you were considered neutral. 

A: Probably, because there, as I told you were th
e ger -- the Argentineans also. So maybe that 
was called neutral camp, but nobody ever told us. 

Q: Who else was immedi atel
y around you in your barracks? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0515  
39 
 
 
A: People that we came together, the 300 from 
Sa lonika. About 50 people from Argentina, or 
Argentineans, but actually from Poland, who unfort
unately they must have 
gotten that citizenship 
through paying money or whatever, they -- and ve
ry few of them survived. They were not 
recognized as Argentineans by the Germans, wher eas
 we, from Salonika, were s -- survived from 
the first to the last one. There wa
s no doubt about our citizenship.  
Q: How wer e  you treated? 
A: We were not treated, period.  

Q: I mean, how -- did your -- di
d the treatment of -- of -- 
A: They used -- they used to bring food once a day through the other Jews that was prisoners in 

the camp. The food, I don™t want to me ntion it. We ha
d to eat it one way or the other. One day a 
week, usually every Friday, we used to go to the 
showers to be cleaned and to have our -- our cl-
clothing been disinfected. We  went to the 
showers, we took our 
clothing, me n and wome n 
together in the same  place, naked. We had about
 five mi nutes of shower, and 75 mi nutes naked 
waiting for our -- our -- our clothi
ng to come back from the -- 
I don™t know how they used to 
call, the place where they di
sinfected them, and then take him back to the camp. 
Q: And besides Fridays, what else do
 you reme mber about the daily routines? 
A: What I reme mber, twice a day we used to have 
what they call the appel, or the appelle. That ™s 
five o™clock in the morning and the evening, wh
ere the German commanda
nt would come with 
his shi -- with his ga -- dog, and ask from the [i
ndecipherable] -- from the [indecipherable] out of 
the camp, how ma ny died tonight, how ma ny died
 today?  Count them, ma ke sure that nobody 
was mi ssing and taken b
ack to the barracks. 
Q: We re people dying right around you, where you were? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0515  
40 
 
 
A: People were dying, but not in our section, beca
use in our section we 
didn™t have to work. 
People that had to work, with th
e -- with the food they were 
given, couldn™t rest too much. 
Q: What were you doing -- you weren™t working duri
ng the rest of the day, were you staying in 
the barracks?  Where were you? 
A: Abso -- absolutely not, I think, staying in
 the barracks, period. And I was lucky enough to 
have a book with me, and I read th
is book ma ybe 10 times. 10 or 20 times. 
Q: Do you reme mber -- do you reme mber what the book was? 

A: Oh yeah, it was a Bible. The Bible in Gree
k. I™m an expert on the Bible now, you can ask me  
anything you want, and I™ll gi
ve it to you. I me morize it.  
Q: Did that help you in any way in term
s of praying, or in terms of religion? 
A: Not in praying, it helped me  very much in ma
king sure I don™t go crazy. 
It helping -- it helped 
me  in spending my time sane instead of, you kno
w, depressed and -- and whatever you call it. 
Yes, it helped me a lot. 
Q: Wa s that unusual?  Did you know anybody 
else who had a Bible with them?  
A: Not that I reme mber. Not that I reme mber. 
Q: And was that one of the only 
things you brought 
with you, then? 
A: That was the only thing I happened to have 
with me  by -- by coincidence or mi stake. How 
very surprised [indecipherable] today, that
 they didn™t take it away from me. 
Q: And did you pray while you were there? 

A: Everybody prayed without hope. 

Q: Did you have a sense that you we
re being treated differently than
 some  of the other prisoners 
at Bergen-Belsen? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0515  
41 
 
 
A: That we knew because we saw the other pr
isoners going to work every morning and comi ng 
back every evening. And we knew that we were not 
working. And that™s help us a lot, except that 

we were living with the fear that we™ll never ge
t out of it, because from the  amount of food that 
they give us, we couldn™t last forever. 

Q: Are you able to tell me
 what you did have to eat? 
A: What we did where? 

Q: Wh- Wha t you ate. What -- what they gave to you. 

A: Stuffed c a bbage. Every week, half a potato. Five
 grams of bread, and a 
little bit of butter and 
milk that we did not eat ourselv
es or drink ourselves, they gave
 it to the young 
children that™s 
happened to be with us, because among the 300 of
 us, there were infants. And we tried to 
preserve them as much as we could. 

Q: Now whe n did you -- were you able
 to see your parents at time s? 
A: Oh, we saw each othe r every day. We  did not 
live together the same  barrack, whether we saw 
each other every day. 

Q: They were close by and you were able to go over and see them?  

A: They™re close by and also my father in a way, 
was privileged at the camp because my father 
was a German schoolteacher in his -- when he was young, Wo rld Wa r I, and the German help 

him a lot. This is part of [indecipherable] like 
to say about the Jews of
 Greece. As long as you 
want to know what happened to them, it™s a di sa
ster. The Jews from Greece were deported to 
Poland exactly when the crematoria were establis
hed in 1943. Before that the Germans used to 
execute the Jews. They didn™t ha ve the crematoria
 ready yet. When they arrived in ger -- in 
Auschwitz, they had three things against them. 
Number one, that the Germans wanted to feed 
and drive the crematorium. Number two, that be
cause there wa s Ladino, they didn™t know it --

End of Tape Two, Side A 
Beginning Ta pe Two, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial  Museum interview with Nick 
Levi. This is tape number two, side 
B. Okay, please -- please continue. 
A: So the third part of it was that -- not bei
ng able to communicate. Th
e people that were on top 
of them took the bread away to serve the -- to 
forced labors. Was slow 
-- steady but steadily they 
were exterminated. That™s why part of th
em, they became Sonderkommando, because the 
mome nt they arrive d there, the Germans were lo
oking for people to use in the crematory. Of the 
population of Europe, or Jewish population of Eu
rope that perished during the Holocaust, the 
percentage of Greek Jews that perished is th
e mo st elevated, the ma xi mu m one. I think about 86 
percent of the Jews from Greece perished in the Holocaust .  

Q: Did you -- did you know any German, and di d that help you in Bergen-Belsen? 

A: Not at all. I didn™t know one word of Ger man. 
Q: But your father did? 
A: Yeah, my father used to communicate 
with them, not that it help him, but -- 

Q: So, did you ever communicate with the Germans at Bergen-Belsen? 

A: Absolutely no contact s at all. 

Q: And so do you even have me mor i es of particul
ar comma nders there at -- at the time , or SS?  
A: [indecipherable] I reme mber the commande
r with his dog. I don™t remember the name. 
Hauptma n Spherer or some thing like that. 

Q: What would have been -- so the language you 
were speaking most of the time while you were 
there was Ladino, or what was the language? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0515  
43 
 
 
A: I used to speak most of the time Greek. Ah --
 my language was Greek. Forget that we were 
Spanish citizens, we were Greeks after all. We  were born in Greece, and we deported from 
Greek. We knew Ladino among our families, but out
side our homes we used to speak Greek.  
Q: What™s the language you speak today the most, at home? 

A: Here at home ?  Five
 languages at the same  time. Ladino, 
Spanish, Hebrew, Greek, French, and 
who knows what else? 

Q: And probably English. 

A: Hebrew -- and Hebrew. English I™m not gonn
a me ntion. [off ca me ra rema rks]. We ™ve been 
here more than 50 years. 

Q: You were telling me  about the crematoria 
at Auschwitz, but what 
did you -- did you learn 
about at Bergen-Belsen -- 

A: I™m not going to answer to th
at. I know about the crematory in 
Bergen-Belsen, but most of the 
people -- the crematoria there were -- were Russi
an citizen -- occu -- pr
i -- prisoners of war. 
They executed an awful lot of Russians there.  
Q: So in your -- in your barracks, as far as commun
icating with others, were
 they -- were they all 
Greek in your barracks? 

A: Yes. Our barrack was only Greeks. Spanish Gr
eeks. The whole barrack of ours was isolated. 
We never -- we did not get in t
ouch with the ot her Greeks in Berg
en-Belsen and we did not go to 
work. The only way we had a contact with them i s  
when they used to come  and bring us the food 
in the morning and we were forbidden to talk to each. The Germans didn™t want them to know 

what was happening in the other camps, because 
ma ybe they knew that sooner or later they had 

to send them to Greece, to send us to Spain. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0515  
44 
 
 
Q: So you weren™t hearing that much, or did you 
hear from other places about what else was 
happening? 

A: We heard from other places what was happe
ning through the Argentineans that came  from 
Poland, and we never believed it. 

Q: How -- how was your health during th
e time  you were at Be rgen-Belsen? 
A: Except for colds, very good. 

Q: And were your parents he
althy, relatively speaking? 

A: Sa me  thing, same  thing. Sa me  thing. 

Q: And were you required to wear the uniforms ?  

A: No. 

Q: Did you continue any religious 
observances while you were there? 
A: No.  

Q: What were you thinking about at
 this stage for the future?  We
re you at all hopeful in any way, 
or -- or -- or not?  Did yo
u some how rema in hopeful? 
A: I gave you the answer before. We  were pos
itive we™ll never get alive fro m the camp, so we 
never gave it any other thought, wh
at™s going to be our future.  

Q: So, tell me  then how it came about when 
you learned that you were going to leave the camp. 
A: We ll, one day a Spanish consul came  to 
Bergen-Belsen, and told us that they ma de 
arrangements to take  us back to Spain. He gave us our passpor ts and he said because  

transportation was very limited, he was going to 
be in two -- two convoys. So I happened to be 
on the second one. First about 150 people went ahead
 of us to Spain, and then the rema ining of 
us went to Spain about two weeks later.  

Q: When wa s this? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0515  
45 
 
 
A: That was 1944 already. I don™t 
reme mber exactly the month. 
Q: You were in Bergen-Belsen approxima tely for how long, do you know? 
A: About eight to nine months. 

Q: And do you know -- did you later learn why you 
were there for that period of time?  Do you 
know -- 

A: Yes, we were told from the Spanish governme nt, that they had no choice. The Ge rmans 

wanted us to be isolated for a certain amount of
 ti me  so we couldn™t communicate with the allies 
and tell them what was happening in Salonika [indecipherabl e] fortificati
ons and other strategic 
things. We  didn™t swallow it, but th
at™s the answer we were given. 
Q: So when you were -- 

A: In other words, we were told after the fact, 
that we were not in a concentration camp, we were 
in a transient camp.  

Q: But at the time it didn™t feel that way.  
A: Of course not. Of course not. Who knew wh
at was happening in the outside? We  were 
completely isolated. 
Q: And were there times where you were worri
ed that you mi ght be sent specifically to 
Auschwitz?  You had heard about
 Auschwitz at this point. 
A: Yes. We  were always worried about what
 was going to happen to us. We knew about 
Auschwitz, and you knew out -- about the crematorie
s in Bergen-Belsen. So what was there to 
think about? 

Q: So when you then heard that you were going to
 Spain, did that give 
you a certain amount of 
hope?   

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0515  
46 
 
 
A: Not til after we transferred fr om there and we
 were in Spain. We  couldn™t believe it and we 
didn™t believe it til we act ually passed Port Bo into the Pyrenees and arrived in Barcelona. 

Q: What was the journey like?  How long did it take? 

A: Very long. I think it took about two and a half
 weeks. And then we waited for about two days 
at the Pyrenees in the frontier because two ourpeople had died, and the Germans wanted to make 

sure that  we sign affi davits that  they didn'
t kill them, that they were natural deat hs.  
Q: Who was  transporting you then, at that time? 

A: The Germans. Everything was done by the Germ
ans. We  - -  we sp -- we nt through the whole 
of France, from Hannover all the way down to Port
 Bo in the Pyrenees with Germans. And we 
signed affidavits before we en
tered Spain to the Germans. 
Q: So each one of you, you had to sign personally?  

A: I think the -- the ma n in ch
arge is the one who signed, who, being a Jew -- his name  was 
Izrhazi -- being a Jew was also before the war,
 and during the war, the consul of Spain in 
Salonika. He  was traveling with us and he is 
the one who certifie
d that they were not killed. 
Q: I -- I just  reme mbered reading that -- that  al
so this Rabbi Koretz wa
s at Bergen-Belsen, were 
you aware of hi m being there? 

A: Yes. We  were of it. We were very aware of
 it and that™s why we hate him much today. I™m 
positive he was a collaborator, that ™s why he surviv
ed. His family survived, all of them. He is the 
only one who died. And he died from
 typhoid and ma ybe from old age. 
Q: So, during the transport, were 
you with your parents the whole time? 
A: Yes. We  were with our pare
nts, we were well fed. We  had no compla ints, except what as I 
told you before, to the last mi nute, we didn™t 
know where we were going. The fear was there.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0515  
47 
 
 
Q: So, if you could tell me  now,
 what happened next?  You got to
 this point where some body had 
to sign these affidavits and th
en you actually entered Spain? 
A: When we  entered Spain, we were under the au
spices of joice distri
 -- Joint Distribution 
Committee, under the [indecipherable]
 or whatever it is, of Samuel Sakura, who happened to be 
also the representative of the Portuguese Red Cro
ss in Spain. We were di
stributed into hotels. 
We were taken bi -- care of it. We
 were, all of us examined to fi
nd out if health-wise we  were bis 
-- perfect, that nothing was wrong with us, and we
 were given as a ma tter of fact, pocket money, 
so we won™t suffer. We  s t ayed in Barcelona abou
t six months, and if it wasn™t for Barcelona we 
wouldn™t be alive today. We were tr
eated royalty. No complaints at all. Now, the reason that we 
left Barcelona is because, as we found out late
r on, there was an agreemen
t that General Franco 
will not accept too ma ny Jews in Spain, there ha d 
to be a certain amount. So they organi zed a 
convoy, they took us from Barcelona through Spain 
to Cadiz, and from Ca diz with a convoy, we 
were took into Casablanca, that other time we
 was liberated from the Germans, and the 
Americans were occupying Morocco. 

Q: Who -- who™s they?  Who is taking you? 

A: What do you mean, who™s they? 

Q: We ll, you were saying they took 
you from Ba rcelona to Ca sablanca -- 
A: Joint Distribution Committee, the f -- Samuel Sakura. Everything was happen in Spain, 

happened through the Portuguese Red Cross, as far as I know. 

Q: A-And the Joint, you™re saying, both -- 

A: The Germans were not there any more.  

Q: No, no, no, but the Joint. 

A: The Joint was financing the whole thing, yes.

Q: How large a group were you at this point? 
A: We  were 300. 

Q: So you were all together again. 

A: The same  group. Always the same  group. We ™ r e 300 there, we™re 300 in Morocco. 

Q: And whe r e did you stay in Morocco, what was the situation there? 

A: In Morocco we was taken to a beach outsi
de Casablanca called Fide
lla, where there was a 
refugee camp of the United Nations. We stayed in
 this camp, in the tents, I believe for about 
seven or eight months, and then from this cam
p, we were taken with a convoy through Argeus, 
from Argeus to Italy, from Italy to Gaza in or der 
to be repa triated to Greece. By that time  it was 
already 1945. 

Q: Do you know the mo nth when that was? 

A: No, the only thing I reme mber is that when we
 got to the concen -- 
to the refugee camp in 
Gaza, the name  of the camp was Lucerite, Greece wa
s not liberated yet. The Greek army in exile 
with a -- with the King George was still in Pale
stine, they were not in Greece yet. The exact 
month, I cannot reme mb er.  
Q: So that™s why you we re se
nt to Palestine, or -- 
A: Were sent  there in order to be repatriated 
to Greece, ye s. We went to a Greek refugee camp, 
but was under the -- not the comm
and -- under the auspices of th
e United Nations. The camp was 
called Lucerite, and the name of the camp -- the na
me  of the people that were running the camp 
for the United Nations was URRA, United Nation
s Rehabilitation and Refugee Admi nistration. 
One thing I have to say that 
being that I knew English, I was 
[indecipherable] and hired by the 
United Nations to help the admi nistration [inde
cipherable] living consta
ntly in the camp.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0515

Q: We ll, the first -- the first U.N. camp that you 
we re at in -- in Casablanca, near Casablanca, 
what were the conditions like there?  
Who else was living there as well? 
Q: The conditions were excellent except that we
 lived in camps, and we lived in tents. Our 
guards were Italian prisoners of war. They were
 the -- the best people you can ever see in your 
life. They were human, they were good, they help
ed us in everything. We had no choice at -- but 
to say thanks to them. 

Q: And you were there for a long time , it sounds like. 

A: Oh, we were there at least six mo
nths, I don™t reme mber exactly how long. 
Q: And -- and who else was part of this camp? 

A: I try to forget that. There 
were some  people that we did not associate with them, who were 
liberated from Spain and came with us to the camp  that were part of the Lincoln brigade that 

fought Franco during the chi -- during the Spanis
h Civil War, and they were imprisoned from 
1936 til ni net -- til 1936 yes, til 1943
 or ™45, that they were sent with us to the camp. 
Q: Wa s this a large group? 

A: Yes, there was a large group, and I™m not goi
ng to say a word about them. They were good 

people, good people. 

Q: And there were others already at
 this camp in clasa -- Casablanca? 
A: No, no. 

Q: It was created basically
 for your group, you think, or -- 
A: Maybe there was a group before us, I don™t know. But the ma xi mu m were there, we  must 

have been about a thousand people, 
no more, no less. I doubt it very much. 
Q: What was your state of mi nd whe n you were at
 that place?  Did you have a good deal of hope 
at this stage? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0515  
50 
 
 
A: We  were liberated, we  were hopeful, we were 
told we are going back to Greece. What will be 
my state of mi nd?  We  were very happy. 
Q: The war wasn™t over yet, right? 

A: No. I™m t a lking 1944. There wh
ere wa -- the war was not over ye
t. We  left Casablanca -- we 
leave Morocco in 1945, where at that time the -- th
e [indecipherable] has taken -- had taken place 
and the Germans were no place to be seen.  

Q: So you think it was approxima te
ly -- you™re not sure exactly when in ™45 you would have left 
Morocco? 

A: No, we left the camp -- no -- May, June of ™45, 
some thing, I don™t -- it was before the end of 
the war, that™s -- I™m sure it was it.  

Q: And wha t  about -- so then tell me  
about the next jour
ney that you went on. 
A: The next journey was 
by train all the way from Morocco to Al
giers. In Algiers we st ayed for a 
few days, and with the convoy we were -- that™s 
why I said the war was not over yet, and with 
the convoy would take you to Tarant o in It
aly at the military camp of the British. 
Q: You me a n Torino in Italy? 

A: Taranto. 

Q: Taranto. 

A: Taranto, not Torinto -- Torino. 
It™s the end of the -- of the boot
. It™s -- one side it™s Taranto 
and the other side I think is Bari, some thing. Ta
ranto, where we were. In
 Taranto we stayed a 
few weeks, and when they had a convoy for the 
Middle East, we were part of this convoy. I 
reme mber it was a convoy of Australia -- Australian 
soldiers who went to Port-Siad. Fr om Port-
Siad we are taken with trucks to
 can -- el Cantara. From el Ca
ntara we cross the Suez Canal, and 
we were take n to Gaza. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0515  
51 
 
 
Q: Did you know where you we
re going at that point? 
A: Yes. We  knew we we re going to Gaza, bepo --
 because we thought we ™ll be repa triated to 
Greece. We  knew we were going to a refugee camp 
of the United Nations, to be assembled and 
sent back to Greece as soon as Greece was liberated. 

Q: How large was that camp?  Who e l se was there? 

A: The camp in [indecipherable] was a large cam
p. Quite a few thousand of people. Quite a few 
Greeks had escaped from Greece, and I do think th
ere were quite a few from Cyprus and Libya, 
but I™m not sure about it. 

Q: These were all Jewish refugees? 

A: No. No, no, no, no, no. We  were the 
only Jewish refugees there.  
Q: So, it™s while you™re at this camp th
at you begin working as a translator? 
A: Not as a translator, I was wo
rking -- working at the b -- at th
e admi nistration of the camp, and 
occasionally because they were all Greeks, I used
 to translate for them, but my main function 
was in the offi ce. Actually, it was bookkeeping to a certain extent. 

Q: How long did you stay at that camp? 

A: The camp was disma ntled at the end of 
1945, I think it was Nove mber, where Greece was 
complete liberated. And they started sending refu
gees back to Greece. I did not leave the camp. I 

stayed there for only one reason. At the time 
there was a civil war going in Greece, the 

Communists and the Royalists, and I 
did not go -- or want to go a
nd get involved in a civil war. 
So when my  tame -- time came to be repatriate
d to Greece, I decided to stay in Palestine. 
Q: Is that -- did your parents stay with you at that time? 

A: Yes. 

Q: And just to back up, do you reme mber wh
ere you were when the war actually ended? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0515  
52 
 
 
A: I was in the camp. 
Q: Wa -- 

A: I was in Gaza. 

Q: And was that a -- a big mo me nt. Do you 
remember hearing the news?  Wa s that -- 
A: There were no big mome nts for us , we suffere
d so much, we didn™t have the strength for 
nothing. We  were -- we were not 
there to celebrate. We  were 
thinking of constantly, what 
happened to our people? Who is alive, who is
 gonna come  back?  How could you celebrate?  How 
could you think differently?  For God™s sake. 

Q: We ll, I wasn™t suggesting cele
brating. I was just wondering ifit was sort of a turning point -- 
A: No, our thoughts were always with the Jews 
that we knew went to Bergen-Belsen and we 
were always thinking, who is going to come  b
ack. That was our only thought. There we re no 
future for us.  

Q: So what happened next?  
You stayed at this camp? 
A: Nothing except I stayed in Pale
stine. I didn™t go back to Greece. 
Q: You™ve never been back to Greece to this day? 

A: Once I was as a tour ist in 1972. But I ne
ver went back to Gr
eece to stay there. 
Q: Did you find anythi ng in Greece of your -- 

A: I didn™t go looking for anythi ng in Greece. In
 1972 it was too late to find some thing. There 
was nobody left, there was nothing left. 

Q: So, can you tell me  a bout your time in Palestine? 

A: What™s there the time in Palestine? I left
 the camp when the camp mo ved from Gaza to a 
different place. They used to call them [ind
ecipherable] the twe. [indecipherable] Mo-Moisi s 
river, in the Suez Canal. We were
 given the choice to go to Palest
ine or to go with them, with the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0515  
53 
 
 
camp, with the United Nations. I decided to stay in
 Palestine, I didn™t want any more part of 
refugee™s camp, and I parted from the United Nati
ons, went to Tel Aviv and with my parents 
started to ma ke a living and find a job. 
Q: What did you do? 

A: What did I do? 

Q: What kind of work, that is. 

A: I was a worker on a company that used to ma
ke perambulators, they 
used to call them in 
English, babies carriages. I used to work there. 

Q: And how long did you do that work? 

A: Til I was drafted into the Israeli army. 

Q: And whe n was that? 

A: That was in 1947, the end of ™47, when th
e United Nations established the petition of 
Palestine and the State of Israel. 
Q: So, can you tell me  a bout your army experience? 
A: I was in the army before [indecipherable] in
 Israel. I was helping ot
her organizations save 
people from Europe. I smuggle refugees into the 
land because be -- the Br itish would not allow -- 
did not allow any more Jews to come into Pale
stine. I helped as much as I could. Wh en the 
petition was ma de, like everybody else, I was draft in 
the ar -- drafted in the army, and I was in 
the army from the beginning of 1948 til July 1949, a year and a half. In 1949, when we -- truce 

was proclaimed and the legitimate state -- govern
me nt of Israel was established, when the 
elections took place, I was released from the army
. I was ma rried in the army, because my wife 
happened to be also a soldier. And in 1949 I left Is
rael and went back to cu
 -- went to Cuba to a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0515  
54 
 
 
cousin of mi ne, hoping that from there I would beable to join my parents in the United States, 
because my parents were given a visa for the 
United States, where I di d not get one myself. 
Q: How come ?  Wa s there a 
reason why you didn't get one? 
A: Yes. There was a quota for it in every country
 in Europe. My father was born in Yugoslavia, 
the quota was free. The Greek quota was filled for th
e next  30 years. I was born in Greece, so I 
didn™t qualify for a visa. 

Q: At this point what wa s your citizenship? 

A: Spanish. But the quota for the United States 
wa s not based on citizenship, it was based on the 
country where you were born. It™s a funny thi
ng, at the time there were about 30,000 Greeks 
asking for a visa, and the quota for the -- for Gree
ce was 308 a year. In other words, there was a 
quota for about a hundred years.  

Q: And whe n did your pa
rents leave Palestine? 
A: They left the beginning of 1946, and they ca
me  here in th-the beginning of 1946, after the 
war.  

Q: And were you usually living with and around 
other Jews fr om Salonika while you™re in 
Palestine?  

A: No, I rented a place, 
and I was living on my own. 
Q: And -- and how did you meet your wife? 

A: We met in the army, we were both soldiers
. We happened to g -- were both from Greece, and 
we worked together from the end of 1947 til 19 
-- til 1949 where a law came that every woman 
that was married would get a discharge from the 
army. So in April of 1949, we were ma rried and 
she was able to star t her civil life,
 where I continue d to the army --

Beginning Ta pe Three, Si de A 
Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holoca ust Memorial Museum interview with Nick 
Levi. This is tape number three, side A. I just
 wanted to correct onething, if you can tell me  
about your time , I believe, in Torino in Italy, a
nd then just explain -- I think you went to the 
Middle East by ship. 

A: [indecipherable] a few weeks, maybe two week
s tops. There™s nothing to say. We  used to 
have the same  rations as the Spanish -- as the Br
itish soldiers, very good 
treat. We  were was -- 
were taken ca re. We  had me dical facilities and we
 were waiting, we were told, to go back to 
Greece. So our stay there d-doesn™t leave an --
 an impression on me, it was a very short one. 
Q: And whe r e were you staying while you were there? 

A: Well, ther e were --  there were tent s,
 like the soldiers. We™re ther e in tents. 
Q: What you were saying before was 
a British army ca mp, is that right? 
A: In the British army camp, yes. All the time  in Torino was the British army ca mps.  
Q: And you -- sorry. And I just wanted to ma ke su
re, since earlier we -- 
you were talking about 
Taranto, but this was Torino. 
A: Torino. 

Q: Okay. And from there you were taken by ship, is that correct? 

A: Today with a convoy were taken by ship to Eg
ypt, to ca -- to Port-Sia
d. And we -- Port-Siad 
by trucks. We crossed the Suez, we went to el Ca
ntara, and by railroad fr om el Cantara to Gaza. 
We went the whole -- the whole Sinai peninsula to Gaza. 

Q: And can you tell me  -- I know you were tellin
g me  how you me t your 
wife, can you tell me  
her name?  

A: Her name is Flora. Her Hebrew name  is Shos hanna.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0515  
56 
 
 
Q: And wha t  was her ma iden name  before ma rriage? 
A: Cohen. C-o-h-e-n. 

Q: And whe r e -- can you tell me  whe r e she was from?  

A: She also was born, I think in Greece or Yugos
lavia. Now -- now it™s -- now it™s Macedonia. 

She was born in Macedonia, and lived all her life in Salonika . 

Q: Okay, now did you -- so now if you coul
d tell me  how you 
wound up going to Cuba. 
A: Very simple. As I expl ained to you, my quot a to come  to United States will take about a 

hundred years. We  had a good cousin in Cuba who 
lived there -- went ther
e after the first World 
War. And we had a cousin there who was able to 
obtain for us a residency in Cuba. So we left 
Palestine in Nove mber of 1949. We  s pent one mo nth 
with a cousin of ours in barce -- in geno -- 
Genoa in Italy. And from Genoa we  went to Co
lumbia and by plane from Columbia -- from 
Barankia, we  went to Cuba. 

Q: How long were you in Cuba and 
what was it like living there? 
A: We  were in Cuba 1950 to 1953, three and a half years. 
Q: And can you tell me  what 
it was like to live there? 
A: Was a paradise. I™m talking to you before 
Castro. We  had a good business, we used to do 
business. We used to import textiles from the 
United States and sell th
em in Cuba. We had no 
complaints, we ma de very good friends. We  ha
d our fa mily, our cousins and uncles there. 
Unfortunately, in 1952 there was go -- they were 
going to have elections in Cuba, and the next 
dictator decided that he wanted
 to be the president. His name  was Fulgencio Batista. He  ma de 

the coup in March of 1952, took over 
the governme nt, insta -- instal
led a dictatorship. From the 
experience we had with dictators, our only way -- 
the only thing left for us was to leave Cuba. 
Q: Before that it was -- you didn™t experience any -- any anti-Semitism? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0515  
57 
 
 
A: Are you kidding, no, nobody ever asked 
us if we were Jewish or wh
ere we l -- where we were 
living, where we came from. Absolute
ly nothing. I can tell you off the record, you can take it -- 
no, you can take it off later on, that the situati
on was so good in Cuba that the ma n who wanted 
to be [indecipherable] senator offered us money 
-- we were there only six months -- offered us 
money to give us -- no, no -- yeah, to give us 
a Cuban citizenship so we can vote for him.  
Q: But you did not become Cuban citizens? 

A: No, no. We were not crazy.  

Q: Okay. And so tell me -- 
tell me  what happened next. 
A: What happened next is that 
we were lucky, for once in our lif
e. Presidents Tru-Truman passed 
a law in Congress admitting 50,000 deported people 
from the war to the United States on top of 
the [indecipherable] the -- the quota. Being as I 
wa s one of the deportees, I qualified, and in May 
of 1953, I came to the United States. 

Q: And that was to New York? 
A: And that™s my life, that™s was to New York
 where my father and mother were living. They 
were still alive.  
Q: What kind of work did you do in the U.S.? 

A: Insurance. I was selling insurance because 
I knew Spanish. I was selling insurance to the 
Puerto geetans -- portag -- port -- to the Puerto Ri
cans, to the Domi nicans, 
but I didn™t stay too 
long because a friend of my father had a furniture store and he needed somebody to speak spa -- 

Spanish so he  ca-can attract the Spanish clientele.
 So I went to work for him as a -- as a -- not 
bookkeeper, how you call that?  The pe
ople they give mortgages, a
nd things like that there. 
Q: Broker, or some thing? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0515  
58 
 
 
A: No, no, no, it™s -- it™s -- the people they approv
e the pr -- they approve the mortgages, how 
you call them?  
Q: Not a lender?  No?  I don™t know, it™s okay. 

A: Anyway, we went there to took over the st
ore and I work for him til -- til -- was 1950 -- ™54 
and -- til 1955. In 1955 he sold the 
store and the company that fina
nced -- oh, financed, financed 
-- the company that fi nanced the st ore saw the qua
lity of approval I was given, asked me  to work 
for them. So I went to work for them, and I st
ayed with them til 1956 - ™57, something like that. 
Then I decide d that I wanted some
thing better than that. I went 
to another furniture company for 
about six months that decided to -- the ma n in 
charge decided to ma ke his own comp any, so I 
went with him, always in the same  kind of busin
ess, as a finance manager, and I stayed with 
them til -- and I™m confused.  

Q: It™s okay, it™s okay, don™t worry. 

A: 1950 some thing -- no, no, ti -- 1964 -- ti -- 1964, when we built Town Craft, the company that 
was -- that was the partners. Yea
h, we establish a company that 
used to sell furniture and all 
kinds of equipment on -- on monthly installments. So, 
with a little bit of a capital that  I had at the 
time, I became again, the finance ma nager of th
e new company, being also
 a partner. I stayed 
with this company from 1965 to 1976. In 1976 through 
a friend of mi ne who used to work on gr 
-- eyeglasses frames, representing a Fr-French 
factory in the United States, I was given the 
opportunity to go with him, and 
to represent this French company from 1976 til 1991, where at 
the age of 70, I decide d to retire. 

Q: We ll, thank you, that™s very detailed. Y-You 
have a good me mory. I know some  of the dates 
are a little rough. 

A: I hope it di -- I hope it
 didn™t confuse you because I™m so emotional now, ma ybe -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0515  
59 
 
 
Q: That™s okay, that™s okay. 
A: -- s-some thing as far as the dates 
only is concerned, mi ght be confusing. 
Q: No, it™s fine. I just have a few mo re questions
 and -- and -- and if you 
could not -- I have to 
keep it quiet, sorry. 

A: Sure. 

Q: No, I™m - -  [tape break]. So, can you just tell
 me about your parents, how long did they live 
and they were always in New York? 

A: Oh, my parents came in 1946 to the States. 
My father died in Nove mber of 1959 and my 
mother died in October 1968.  

Q: And tell me -- I believe you 
have children, is that right? 
A: I have two children. One is a dentist, he is 53 
years old, and one is an architect, he just turned 
50. 

Q: Can you tell me  their name s?  
A: The first name  is from the Hebrew Menachem
, his name  is Meny. And the second name  -- the 
second one is the Hebrew na me  for her father, 
who was Moshe, and his name  is Murray. Meny is 
the dentist, ma rried to a wonderful girl, has tw
o children, lives in Jers
ey. One of a gr -- my 
grandchildren is in third year 
in Union College, and the other one
 is just finishing high school. 
They live in West Caldwell. They are very, very
 active in orga -- Jewish
 organizations. They™re 
very, very active in their syna
gogue. That™s why their -- my da
ughter-in-law asked my wife if 
she wanted to be the guest speaker for the Shoa
h this year. Now, my second son is not ma rried. 
He lives very happily in Manhatt
an, but we are not happy that he
 is all alone in his life.  
Q: And tell me about your own involvement, I belie
ve, with -- with the organization, I believe in 
the 80™s you were president, can you tell me  a little bit?

A: Yeah, we went -- we came here 1953. At that 
time survivors from the Holocaust we re also 
comi ng from Greece on the base of this law th
at I told you, 50,000 the pre -- the displaced 
people. Most of them di d not speak English, di
d not know any professions. They quin -- they 
came here with the HIAS. Some  of them were sent 
to Flint, Michigan, others were sent here. So 
there was an organization that in 
a way was trying to help them, 
with the language, with the daily 
life, with the profession, with h
ealth, that was called [indeciph
erable] brotherhood of America. 
My father was a me mber  of this organizati
on and we became me mbers imme diately. We became 
active. While the old people that build the organi
zation in 1917, after the 
first war passed away, 
slowly but steadily, we took care of it. And in the 
elections in the 80™s, I 
was elected president. I 
served two terms, because elections were two years,
 I se rved fer -- four years as pr esident, and is 
still today very active in thisorganization. I™m a me mber of the 
central board of [indecipherable] 
and I participate in everyt
hing that I can help them. 
Q: Are there other ways that you ha
ve been involved with either 
groups of Greek survivors, and -
- and those sorts of organizations? 

A: First we -- I helped quite a few of them that
 decided to relocate fr
om Greece to -- to United 
States. Most of them did not stay here, they went
 to San Francisco. I helped them as mu ch as I 
could because at that time I needed help myse
lf. And I participate in every fundraising from 

Israel. I have certificates of Is
raeli bonds for what I did for the bonds. I sh -- was me mber of 
B™nai Zion. I was -- I was helping, an
d I still help UJA, and as much as I can I try to keep our 
Sephardic tradition because unfortunately we ar
e not as ma ny as Ashkenazi. Our language, our 
Ladino is disappearing, it™s not 
like the Yiddish. And I have a f
eeling that after our generation 
there™ll be nothing left 
of the Jewish tradition. 
Q: We re you able to teach Ladino to your children? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0515  
61 
 
 
A: My children do not speak Ladino, I™m sorry to say that. They do not speak Spain -- French. 
They speak -- they speak Spanish, they learned 
Hebrew. They™re involved with their crowd, and 
everything that™s Jewish, thank God for it. They 
are more or less observant. They participate in 
their synagogue, and that™s the best I can hope. 

Q: Do you think that your -- your faith he
lped you through all 
of your experiences? 
A: Ah, I™ll be  honest with you, no. I™ve kept my fa 
-- my faith because it was 
part of my life from 

the day I was born, but did not help me  in any 
way, on the contrary, in 
quite a few inst ances, I 
suffered because I was Jewish. And I don™t mean just the Holocaust, I mean here in the United 

States.  

Q: You did experience anti-Semitism here? 

A: Yes.  

Q: I w -- I wa s also thinking ma ybe -- sort of 
larger faith in God, did that help you to get 
through?  
A: No, the faith I had in God, I still have. I 
don™t think it was too much, I hope it was more, but 
as far as I am concerned, He helps me , He exists, and [indecipherable] all the comma ndments I 
tried to follow, the si -- the rich words of our religion. 

Q: And you -- you have a Sephardic 
temple you go to in this area? 
A: Yes, we have a Sephardic temple in Forest 
Hills, where I belong, and where I a me mber of the  
board.  

Q: Did you speak ch -- 

A: And by the way, on this Sephardic temple, I was 
in the executive for at least se ven years. I™ve 
been on the Board of Directors of the temple from 1972 til today. 

Q: What™s the name  of t he synagogue? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0515  
62 
 
 
A: Sephardic Jewish Brotherhood of Forest Hill
s. No, I™m s orry, Sephardic Jewish Ce nter of 
Forest -- I™m confusing with the brotherhood.  
Q: Did you -- did you ever talk to 
your sons about 
your experiences? 
A: Always. Always. As much as I tried to spare them the tales, they know the whole thing. 

Q: So you were willing to shar
e with them your experiences? 

A: Oh yes. I™m always willing to share my e
xperiences. I was willing to make sure that the 
Holocaust doesn™t di sappear after I disappear. 

Q: I -- I know a lot of survivors for many decades 
did not talk about their 
experiences. Was that 
similar for you, for awhile you didn™t talk? 

A: No, I always tried not to talk about it wi
th strangers, not with my fa mi l y. Many people 
complain, why didn™t you say what™s happened to 
you?  I don™t want any part
 of it. I try not -- I 
cannot forget, but I™m trying not to
 reme mber. I [indecipherable] all 
right to give other people the 
suffering, to a certain extent, of what I went. It do
esn™t help. The only thing I try to do is m -- to 
ma ke sure that they know -- they know the Holo
caust existed, and to perpetuate the me mory of 
the Holocaust.  

Q: I hope you realize that by doing this interv
iew that™s exactly what
 you™ve done. I know it 
hasn™t been diff -- it hasn™t been 
easy for you to do this interview. 
A: Darling, that™s why I decide
d to give you the interview. 

Q: I™m -- I™m very grateful and -- and so is the 
museum. I -- I realize that it™s been difficult for 

you to re -- reme mber. 

A: It™s done. 

Q: Is there -- a couple other small questions, on
e is did you -- or do you still receive restitution, 
reparations from Ger many? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0515  
63 
 
 
A: Yes, I do. From conference number two. 
Q: And tell me  how -- you told me  this before we
 started the interview, 
tell me how you came to 
change your name  from your birth name  to Nick. 

A: During Greek wa -- during the German occ
upation, I couldn™t use the name Haim, so I 
became Nick. When the whole thing finished, and all my family disappeare
d, the few friends that 
were left, they were Orthodox, and they called me Nick. So when the time  ca me  to become  a 

U.S. citizen, I deti -- decided that
 it was foolish for my friends to call me  Nick and my name  to 
be Haim. So I changed officially my name , the da
y -- the day I became  a citizen, to Nick. And all 
my documents in the United States, fr om the Soci
al Security, from my 
work, from my taxes, 
from everything are under the name  of Nick. 

Q: Okay, well, is there -- is there an
ything else that you would like to -- 
A: By the way, some thing more that is trivia, 
but maybe this will help explain why I use the 

name  Nick. In the old country they used to give 
the name  Nic k -- used to give the name  Hai m to 
babies so they survive. I had a brother who died
 at the age of four. So, his name  was David. My 
parents decided to put me  the name  Haim. When
 the emancipation came , the Jews of Salonika, 

who were very much involved in French culture
, decided that Haim is
 not such a good Jewish 
name . Instead of giving the name  Hai m, let™s gi
ve the guy a name  of survivor. And the name  
they choose for all the Haims was Vi ct
or. Most of the Victors are Haim. 
Q: That™s interesting. 

A: So Victor become  Nic ky -- became Nick. 

Q: Huh. We ll, thi -- but this name  you ch -- 

A: This you can keep off the record, I mean, I don™t want -- 

Q: It™s interesting, but this name  -- 
but you chose Nick even much earlier. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0515

A: Be chose -- no, no, no, no. I chose Nick [indeci
pherable]. I chose Vict
or, and from Victor, 
Nick. 
Q: I-I thought Nick was from Ni
cholas, a Greek sort of name. 
A: Ni -- Nick -- Nicholas. Nichol
as in Greek me a ns the winner of the pa -- of the people. Nicos 
Laus. Laus means people. 

Q: And -- and the brother you had, was he older? It™s before you were born? 

A: No, he was younger than me , and he died before I was born.  

Q: So he was older -- he -- he
 was older -- he was born -- 
A: He died four years old, before I was born. 

Q: And do you know how he died? 

A: No. I know it was a sickness, I don™t know if 
it -- it was an epidemic or what. My parents 
never spoke about it. 

Q: We ll, I want to thank you for taking the time  toda
y. Is there -- is there anyt
hing at else -- at all 
you would like to say to conclude? 

A: No, not -- I haven™t got, unless you need
 some thing else. I™m always available. 
Q: We ll, you™ve -- you™ve been 
wonderful, I really appreciate. Thank you very much, and -- 
A: You™re welcome. You™re always welcome,
 do you feel like comi ng again, and we™re here. 
Q: Thank you. 

A: We ™re here, we feel that what we
 did today is to our own benefit. 
Q: Absolutely. This conc ludes the United States
 Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with 
Nick Levi.
