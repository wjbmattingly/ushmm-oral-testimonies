We begin with this photo of J ulius  Menn as  a young boy. He was  born in 1929 in the Fr ee City 
of Danzig, now Gdansk , Poland.
 
 
In 1935, J ulius , his  parents  and younger s ister, Bella, legally em igr ated to Pales tine. In the 
summer of 1
938, the family traveled back to Poland to vis it relatives  over  the s ummer holiday. At the 
end of the s um m er  the fam ily did not r eturn to Pales tine. Pictured here ar e J ulius , his s is ter , Bella, and 

their Germ an governes s  in Wars aw, Poland, in 1938.
 
 
Germ an
y invaded Poland on September
 
1, 1939. Shortly after the invasion, the Menn fam ily 
fled eas tward. On this  map of Poland, the ar row shows  the route the Menn family took . Beginning in 
Bialys tok , they traveled with other  r efugees for  two weeks  in the forests 
and fields  of eastern Poland, 
eventually m aking it to Molodec zno, a m ajor r ailr oad junction. The ar row ends  at the approximate 

loc ation of Molodeczno.
 
 
Fr om ther e, a young Soviet offic er helped the Menn fam ily get a train to Vilnius , where they 
lived in the ghetto for a year . In the fall of 1940, David managed to get four of a total of 300 tr ans it Vis as  
that had been is s ued by the Soviet Union. The Menn fam ily traveled to Odes s a and fr om there took  a 
s hip to Turkey and eventually to Pales tine, arr iving in Tel Aviv in Oc tober
 
1940. The Menn fam ily is  
pic tured here in Tel Aviv in 1945. J ulius  is on the right.
 

 
J ulius  s er ved in the Haganah, the J ewis h Defense Forc e in Pales tine, as a teenager  and later 
as  a junior offic er . In 1947, Julius  moved to the United States  to attend univers ity but he r etur ned to 

Is r ael in 1948 to s erve in the Arm y in the War of Independenc e. Here we see J ulius  as  an offic er in the 
Is r aeli A rm y.

Als o, I want to thank the s pons or s  of this  pr ogram . This  pr

I am really happy to partic ipate in it.
 
 
I jus t want to s ay one thing befor e I start. My s tory is a s tor y of an ac c idental s urvivor  of the 
Holoc aus t. And you will s ee why. And als o, you mus t pr
ojec t
 
your s elf when you were about 10 y
ear s  
old bec aus e mos t of those events  happened to me when I was , like, 10, going on 11, starting at age 9.
 
 
So anyhow. You asked m e about
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Your early year s , befor e you went to Pales tine.
 
> > J ulius  Menn:  I was , as  Bill m entioned, born in
 
Danzig.
 
My father  was  a s oldier  in the Arm y in World 
War I. He fought on the Aus trian fr ont. Dur ing the Comm unis t r evolution, 
Danzig
 
was  dec lar ed by the 
League of Nations , whic h was  s ort of the forerun of the United Nations , as a free c ity with a very lib
er al 

5 
 
c ons titution. I'm J ewis h, m y parents  wer e J ewis h. It was  a ver y good c onstitution. In fact, it was  very 
s im ilar  to the A m eric an 
C
ons titution. It em ancipated the J ewis h people. So many of them went to 
Danzig. 
I lived there until I was  6 years  old. I was  born in 
Danzig
 
its elf but we m oved to a sm all town. 
 
 
Danzig was  a c ity that had als o s ever al villages  around it. And it was  on the Baltic  Sea, 
oppos ite Sweden.
 
It was  wonderful. I lear ned to ice skate. And I was  pr etty good at it when I was  a kid.
 
A t ag
e 6, my father, who believed in es tablis hing a J ewis h s tate in Is r ael, wanted us  to move there.We 
finally moved in 1935 when I was  6 years  old.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Before you tell us about the m ove to Palestine, your  father was  a s ucc es sful 

bus ines s man. Tell
 
us  a little bit about him.
 
> > J ulius  Menn:  My father  only had a 6th grade educ ation but he was  a very intelligent man.When we 

lived in Danzig, he s tarted to trade in lumber. Lumber  was  im ported fr om Sweden for paper. And this  is  

how he m et my gr andfather  who had a large for es t in nor theaster n Poland and a factory in Bialys tok . 

He had s ever al daughters . And my father fell in love with m y m other. They got mar ried in the great 

s ynagogue inWar s aw, befor e the Holoc aus t. And they s ettled in Danzig until 1935.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And that's  when they emigrated to Pales tine.
 
> > J ulius  Menn:  When we emigr ated to Palestine.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Tell us about that.
 
> > J ulius  Menn:  What was  inter es ting about it
 
--
 
I had a Ger m an gover ness . You s aw the pictur e. She 
was  Ca
tholic . She loved m y s is ter and s he loved me and I loved her ver y m uc h. She really was  like a 
m other  to us.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And a gover nes s  in today's language would be like a nanny, right?
 
> > J ulius  Menn:  Yes . Today you don't find this kind of devotion 
of a governes s  going with us  to 

Pales tine.
 
 
Unfortunately later  s he retur ned to Ger many
 
--
 
she was  fr om  Ber lin
 
--
 
and s he was  killed in the 
A
llied bombings  in Berlin. I lear ned about this after the war. Naturally I was  ver y, ver y s ad and ver y 
ups et.

>> Bil
l Bens on:  But s he was  ther e with you in Pales tine when you firs t went ther e.
 
> > Julius  Menn:  She lived with us  in Pales tine.
 
> > Bill Bens on: What was  your  father's bus ines s onc e he got to Pales tine?
 
> > Julius  Menn:  Well, my father was  a Zionis t in the pos itive s ens e. He and his  br other establis hed a 
c em ent fac tor y in the foothills  of J erus alem. So he was  an indus tr ialis t.
 
 
Should I start now about 1930?
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Not quite yet. Her e you ar e 6 year s  old. You wer e going to s c hool. What was  s c hool 

l
ike?
 
> > J ulius  Menn:  This  is very im portant now. I was  going to 1st gr ade. I didn't know any Hebrew. All the 
teac hing was  in Hebr ew. It's very interes ting. The teac her was  reading to the c las s  
ﬁ
Robins on Cr usoe,
ﬂ 
whic h I'm s ur e m ost of you have r ead. Of c our s e, it was  in Hebrew. I only s poke German. So at reces s  I 
would c ome to the teac her s  and I would tell her , Mrs .
 
So
-
and
-
s o, pleas e tell me the stor y in German. 
Bec aus e s he k new Germ an. And s he would. It's really a r em arkable stor y.
 
 
I m us t s ay that life in Tel Aviv, whic h was  on the Mediterr anean 
S
ea, was  wonderful for 
c hildren. For  one thing, after c las s in the 1st and 2nd grade, 3rd grade, I jus t would go to the beac h by 

m ys elf and s wim. You didn't need anybody to pr otec t you. People didn't loc k  their ho
us es. Ther e was  

no c r im e. I must s ay, it was  a wonderful life.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You lived there for s everal year s . And then in 
1938
 
--
 
> > J ulius  Menn:  My m other  wanted to vis it her mother in Poland who had a hous e in Bialys tok and 
Vilnius . My gr andfather was  alr eady dead. My mother had three s is ter s . One of them  drowned. But two 
s is ter s who lived ther e and two brothers. And my father still had pr operty near  Danzig that he wanted to 

s ell to the governm ent.
 
 
So reluc tantly
 
--
 
we wer e going to go only for  the
 
s um m er . Believe m e, I was  in 3r d gr ade
 
--
 
I 
finis hed 3r d gr ade. The pros pec t of leaving my friends , m y c ultur e, my new c ulture, m y Hebr ew 

c ulture
 
--
 
imagine yours elf, as Am er ic ans , going, let's s ay to Mexic o
, 
wher e you have to go and learn a 
new language,
 
m ost of the people are Catholic . The s am e thing happened to m e in a s ens e. I went to 

7 
 
Poland as  a 9
-
year
-
old and I had to lear n Polis h bec aus e Hebr ew, of c ourse, was  unknown. And that 
was  als o the plac e, for  the fir st time, wher e I experienc ed indir ec tly dis c r imination. The Pols wer e about 
95% Catholic . Ther e was  no separ ation of r eligion from the s tate as we have in the United States .
 
So the fir st hour in the s chool was  devoted to Catholic  c atec his m.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And this was  a public  s c hool.
 
> > J ulius
 
Menn:  Public  sc hool. There were a few of us who wer e Jewis h students . We had to leave the 
c las s  and go s tand in the hall s inc e we wer e not par t of the
 
--
 
we wer e not c o
-
r eligious. And I thought 
this  was  very s trange.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And J ulius , of course, your  family  went ther e expec ting to be ther e for the s umm er s o 

you had or iginally expec ted you would be bac k  in Tel Aviv for  the s chool year . But, ins tead, you're 
c ontinuing in Poland.Why was  that?
 
> > J ulius  Menn:  For the 4th grade. Yeah. For many reas ons  we didn't go bac k . I was  enr olled in a 

Polis h s c hool, as I was telling you about, the c atec his m c las s.
 
So I s tudied for a year  Polis h. Actually, I 
am  pr etty good still in P olis h
 a
fter s o many year s . 
 
 
Exc us e me.
 
 
The year  went by and again another s um m er . Now it's  1939. My grandmother  had a s ummer 
c ottage near the town of Vilna you s aw before the m ap of Poland. Maybe we c an get the map
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on: We c an't, unfortunately.
 
> > J ulius  Menn:  I r emem ber I went with my gr andm other to the s umm er 
c ottage. She taught m e how to 
pic k  m us hr ooms  in the forest and berr ies. And how to s eparate the m us hrooms  from the pois onous  
from the
 
--
 
to the edible. So this  was  wonderful. Als o, I would pr anc e around in the for est in a bathing 
s uit and a little knife. I
 
c arved
 
--
 
they had a pine tree that had a very nic e bark. And I would c ar ve the 
bark into a boat. It jus t was
 
--
 
I played Tarzan. Tar zan was  ver y popular in thos e days .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So J ulius , while you're doing that, the year  s tr etc hes out. You r em ain in Poland through 

the s ummer of 1939. You'r e s till in Poland. And war  is  bec om ing im minent. Do you think your parents , 

8 
 
at that time, by extending their s tay ther e, do you think they wer e awar e of the threat of Nazis m by that 
tim e? 
 
> > Julius  Menn:  As  I mentioned befor e, my governess went back to Germany and she would wr ite 
letter s to m y father. She would s ay, I'm writing this  letter with great danger to mys elf bec aus e of the 
Nazi c ens ors . If the Nazi c ens ors open it I will be s ent to conc entration c amp. But s he s aid, Mr .
 
Menn, 
go back bec aus e the war is  c om ing. And the whole world knew that the war  was  c oming and yet we 

s tayed.
 
 
So in the s umm er  of 1939, s c hool was finis hed, my father  went to Danzig to sell his  bus ines s. 
My m other and my s is ter and I went
 
to this  res ort that was  c los e to Eas t Prus s ia. On that map maybe 
you s aw, ther e was  a piec e of Germany that was  ver y c los e to Poland.
 
 
At the end of the s umm er, September
 
1, the Germans  invaded Poland.We were very c los e to 
Eas t Pr us s ia. Fortunately we c am e, with fr iends who had a c ar, back  to Bialys tok . It actually was  not 

ter r ibly far. I think I would es tim ate about m aybe 60 to 100
 
m iles .
 
 
As  s oon as we c ame
 
--
 
m y father was  in Danzig. As  s oon as we c am e to Bialys tok , the 
Germ an dive bom bers wer e bom bing
 
the population.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And you r em em ber  that. Don't you?
 

> > J ulius  Menn:  Yes , I do.
 
 
And I was  m obilized to help dig ditc hes . As the dive bomber s would c om e down, they would 
m ac hine gun the c ivilians .
 
And als o, the windows wer e taped bec aus e we
 
were afr aid of gas war
fare.
 
 
My m other went back to Wars aw. The Germ ans  wer e s urr oundingWars aw, but the Pols  
ac tually fought ver y valiantly. Wars aw was  one of the las t c ities to fall. So she phoned my father and 

they c ame back to Bialystok. How s he m anaged to find m y father is  a mir acle.
 
 
My father imm ediately s aid we have to leave this  town bec aus e the Ger mans  will invade any 
day. So he found m y late grandfather's old c oac hman. The c oac hm an agreed to take us to Vilna 

through the fores t. This  was  very unu
s ual bec aus e he didn't want any money. People wer e ver y, in 
thos e days , devoted to eac h other . And bec aus e of his  devotion to m y grandfather, he wanted to do 

9 
 
s om ething nic e for  us .
 
So for  about two weeks  we piled into this  c ar t that was  dr iven by a hor s e, 
c over ed with s traw, with a tent over it. It was  just like the pioneers  150 year s  ago going from  the eas t to 
the wes t.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Like a 
Cones toga wagon.
 
> > Julius  Menn:  Yes . For  two weeks we wander ed 
in
 
the for est of Poland. This  is really m y experi
enc e 
about the Holoc aust. The Germ ans  would dive bomb the r efugees  and we would jum p into the wheat 

fields.Why the wheat fields
? 
It was  late September or middle September. It was  time to harves t the 
wheat but ther e was  nobody to har ves t it bec aus e the Polis h farmer s  wer e in the Ar my. So we would 

jum p into the field while the Germ an bom bers would dive bom b.
 
They als o m ade this ter rible nois e to 
s c ar e the people. They would m ac hine gun everybody. How we s ur vived this  I don't know.
 
 
Thes e events  lasted s ever al tim es  during the day and they would las t maybe 20 m inutes or 
s o. Then the planes  would go away. Maybe would they r e
-
em erge. The roads  wer e s tr ewn with piec es  
of human, bloodshed, anim als , c ows , dead c ows , car s  that wer e burning. It was  horr ible. I s till 

r em em ber this.
 
 
War is a terr ible thing. I k now for Amer ic ans  it's ver y difficult to vis ualize war bec aus e the only 
people who r eally exper ience war in this c ountr y wer e the G.I.s who fought in the war s . But imagine 

that you lived in the s outh. You s aw on televis ion the terrible tornadoes . You go in the mor ning to 

s c hool. You c ome hom e and ther e's no hom e becaus e the tornado des troyed it. This  is  what war  is . 

War des tr oys  your life. And the war , and the Nazis, destr oyed the Holoc aus t
 
--
 
des tr oyed the J ewish
 
people of Eur ope.
 
 
When I give many talks in Mas s ac hus etts, and when I talk  to 7th grader s , I always  tell them  it 
is  hard to vis ualize how ter rible the Holoc aus t was . But s ix million people, s ix million J ews , were killed 

by the Nazis  in c onc entration c am ps . The population of Mas s ac hus etts is  about s ix m illion. So I said, 

Suppos e you wake up in the m or ning and the whole s tate the people ar e dead; this is  what the 

Holoc aus t is . Bec aus e ever ybody was  gone.
 
It wiped out
 
--
 
in Poland there were over  three m illi
on 

10
 
 
J ews  out of a population of 30
 
m illion. They wer e invited to live there for  a thous and year s . The Polis h 
king invited them to c ome from Germ any and s ettle ther e.
 
 
One thing that's  very im por tant is  what did we eat in thes e two weeks  wandering in the for
est. 
Well, the firs t week we ate apples . It's pr etty difficult to eat apples  for a week . The c ons equenc es  ar e 
you get ter rible diarrhea. And the s ec ond week  we c am e to a c hicken farmer and m y father got lots of 

eggs. So for about a week  we ate r aw eggs.

w eggs ar e rather terr ible.
 
> > [Laughter] 
 

> > Julius  Menn:  Dogs  like them but people don't like them.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And after  two weeks  of doing all of that, being s tr afed routinely, eating the way you 
des c r ibed, you m ade it to Molodeczno. What happene
d onc e you got there? 
 
> > Julius  Menn:  As  Bill des c ribed, Molodeczno was  a r ailr oad junc tion town in eas ter n Poland. The 

dr iver left us  on the r ailr oad tracks or on the platform. He s aid, "I have to go hom e." And we just s tood 

ther e. And then I r emember  this .We heard this  rum ble. It becam e louder and louder . And thos e were 

tanks  c oming. 
 
 
We wer e c onvinc ed that they wer e German but they wer e Rus s ian, the Red Army. Hitler  
s igned a s ecr et treaty with Stalin in 1939, jus t the end of 1938, m aybe, that they will div ide Poland and 
eas ter n Poland will go to Rus s ia, wes ter n Poland to Germany. 
 
 
So the tanks wer e followed by this  huge Army. This  young Rus s ian offic er , as  Bill des c ribed, 
c am e on the platform and he gave my little s is ter  a c hoc olate bar. He s tarted t
alking to m y father. He 
s aid, "Are you J ews ?"  He s aid, "Yes ." And he s aid, 
ﬁW
ell, I'm Rus s ian
-
J ewis h.
ﬂ  
So he s aid, "Where do 
you want to go?"  He s aid, "Well, we want to go to Vilna." So he s ays , "I'll put you on a militar y tr ain." 

And he put us on a military train. We c ame to Vilna.We c ame to my gr andmother's hous e whic h was  

loc ked bec aus e s he was  in Bialys tok.
 
 
And it's ver y interes ting. She wouldn't leave Bialy s tok bec aus e she lived through the Fir st 
WorldWar in Bialystok . She told m y father, s he said, Well, the Rus s ians  wer e wors e to us in World War 

11
 
 
I than the Germ ans. The Germans wer e c ivilized; m aybe they will be c iviliz ed this  tim e. So s he s tayed. 
Well, other things  happened to us.
 
 
But anyhow s o we c ouldn't s tay in Vilna. We went to the c ountr ys ide wher e m y grandmother 
had a large far m. We s pent ther e
 
about two weeks. I lear ned one thing, how to r ide a c ow without a 
s addle. That's very difficult, I must s ay. I don't know how m any of you have tr ied to r ide a c ow. It's  

alm ost impos s ible.
 
 
After two 
weeks  we returned to Vilnius . The politics  were very com plic ated. It bec ame 
Lithuania. So I had to go to s c hool and lear n Lithuanian and Lithuanian history.
 
I'll just tell you one 
thing. Lithuanian is  very different than Polis h. It's unlike any other language. And als o, Poland and 
Lithuania at one tim e wer e united but Lithuania was  onc e a ver y gr eat c ountr y and they bas ic ally 
c aptured parts  of Rus s ia thr ough the 
Black S
ea.
 
 
Als o in Poland, bec aus e there were s o m any J ewis h people, the J ews  had their  own 
Con
s titution from the Polis h gover nm ent whic h allowed them to keep their  own public  s c hools . And the 
public  s c hools  wer e c alled
 
--
 
to translate to Englis h it s aid c ultur e. In thes e s c hools , most s ubjects  were 
taught in Hebrew but you had to study the his tory 
of the c ountry and the language. I just r em ember a 

few wor ds from it.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And that's  what you wer e doing in Vilnius. So our audience under stands
,  
s o you are in 
the Rus s ian
-
oc c upied part of the c ountry.
 
> > J ulius  Menn:  Yeah. And als o,
 
I must s
ay, when we got to Vilnius
, Viln
ius
 
is  a very old c ity. It has  a 
great his tor y. But we had no m oney s o we ended up living in one r oom in the J ewis h ghetto. The 

ghettos wer e es tablis hed in Italy in the m iddle ages . The J ews  lived in great dens ity in s uc h pl
ac es. It 
was  ter rible living in this  room bec aus e at night the r ats  and m ic e would em erge from the floor s , from 

the s pac e in the floors.
 
Als o, I had to walk to s c hool about half an hour. Vilnius  in the winter is  ver y, 
very c old. I didn't have any warm  c lothes . My mother had to r ub m y legs  with anim al fat bec aus e 

otherwis e my legs would fr eeze off.
 

12
 
 
 
So I finis hed the year. And I must tell you, the J ews  of Vilnius  r evolted agains t the Nazis . They 
were, I would s ay, 99% k illed by the Nazis .
  
 
Year s  later  when I was  in the Army offic er's training, ther e was  a gir l who was  a s ur vivor from 
m y c las s . And when I s aw her , this was  one of the most moving times of m y life. We hugged. It was  
am azing. When I s till think  about it now, I s hudder s om etimes.
 
> > Bill Bens on: 
 
She was  in Vilnius  with you and s urvived.
 
> > J ulius  Menn:  She was  only s urvivor .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So you're in Vilnius , living in very , ver y diffic ult c ir c ums tanc es .Was your father try
ing
 
har d to figur e out how to get you back to Pales tine at that point
? 
 
> > Julius  Menn:  Yeah. If we had m oney, we c ould have flown to Sweden. And from  Sweden was  a 

so-
c alled neutr al
 
--
 
we could have flown fr om Sweden to anyplace.
 
 
We still had a Britis h c ertific ate. It's like a vis a, that we c ould go back to Pales tine. But
 
how? 
Well, as I s aid, people wer e ver y devoted to eac h other . My father  m et in Lithuania a friend of his from  

year s  befor e who bec ame ver y wealthy. He gave m y father the equivalent of
 
$5,000, whic h was  a lot of 
m oney in thos e days . And with this  m y father
 
was  able to buy a tr ans it vis a to the Soviet Union
. I
n 1940 
it was  extr emely diffic ult. As  Bill m entioned, ther e wer e only 300 J ewis h fam ilies  who were able to go to 

Rus s ia, back  to Pales tine.
 
 
I r em ember being in Mos c ow two days . And this  was  very inter es ting. We s tayed in this  hotel 
that befor e the revolution the Soviets
 
--
 
the Communis t r evolution, it was  a very fanc y hotel but it fell on 
bad tim es . The c handelier s  whic h wer e beautiful at one tim e wer e c overed with c obwebs . The beautiful 

c ur tains were in tether s. We wer e the only gues ts in the dining r oom. They gave us  a m enu that was  a 

very thic k m enu but the waiter  s aid we only had one dis h, s tew.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  But he gave you this  big m enu any way.
 
> > J ulius  Menn:  Yeah. Then, m y father befr iended t his  waiter and told him we are going to Odes s a, 

whic h is  the Rus s ian c ity on the Black  Sea. And the waiter s aid,Well, it will take about thr ee days  and 

13
 
 
ther e won't be any food on the tr ain. So my father  tr aded s o
m e s ilk ties  for  baked 
goos e. And the goos e
 
was  pr etty good.
 
 
By the way, Europeans  don't eat s o m uc h turkey; they eat goos e, es pec ially for  Chris tmas .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So that was  the food you would take on the tr ain with you.
 
> > J ulius  Menn:  Yeah.
 
 
I r em ember it was  wintertime. We got on the tr ain and went to Rus s ia and Mos c ow and c ame 
to Odes s a. In Odes s a, the Soviets  c us tom s took  ever ything away. My mother had a fur c oat. They took  
the fur c oat away. I had s om e s tamps  that wer e my
 
--
 
m y grandfather c ollec ted stam ps . They took  them 
away, too.
 
Th
ey gave us r ec eipts whic h wer e m eaningles s , really.
 
 
And thr ough Turkey, we managed to come back  to Pales tine c overed with r ed bugs that we 
pic ked up on the tr ain in Turkey.
 
Pales tine was  a Br itis h c olony. Rem em ber , this  was  WorldWar II. We 
went to Tel Av
iv
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  This was  Oc tober
 
1940.When you got back  to Tel Aviv. Ok.
 
> > J ulius  Menn:  And Ger man and Italian bom bers  would bom b Haifa, whic h was  the c ity where they 
had oil refiner ies , bec ause it was  a c onc entration plac e for Br itis h troops . Many of the planes , becaus e 
it was  s o far  for them to fly, they c ouldn't unload the bombs on Haifa s o they would unload them on Tel 

A viv.
 
 
I r em ember the hous e we lived in. Ever y night we had to go down to the shelter bec aus e of 
the air r aids. After a while I didn't go down anym ore bec aus e I felt I'd r ather  s leep. So m y par ents , they 
c ouldn't take m e down. 
 
 
You s ort of los e fear .
 
In one s c hool
 
--
 
and this  was  a ver y good question. One of the 7th 
grader s asked m e:Were you afr aid when they wer e bom bing the r e
fugees? 
I thought about it. It's a 
very good question.
 
 
Children, it's a high s c hool s tudent, c an only be afraid, I felt, for the ins tance when the fear 
happens , bom bing. When you ar e bombed, you ar e afraid that you will be killed. But onc e the planes  

14
 
 
left
 
you forget about it. Bec aus e the fear s tays  with adults  as  anxieties  but c hildr en don't have s uc h 
anxieties  by and large if they are well off c hildren. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  As you m entioned, of c our s e the war is  going on. Pales tine its elf was  a major staging
 
ar ea for the Allies ; s o ther e wer e tens of thous ands , if not hundreds  of thous ands of Allied troops  
c om ing into Pales tine. Right? 
 
> > J ulius  Menn:  Yes . And the Ger man Army, at that time, was  advanc ing into Egypt.We were actually 
pr epar ed that the German
s  would oc c upy Pales tine. So we were going to r un away into the mountains . 

Well, this never  happened bec aus e ther e was  a big battle but the Germans wer e defeated. And the 

B r itis h forces, 
A
llies , they were als o aided by Amer ic an s upplies  and Am er ic an tr oops
. 
> > Bill Bens on:  And for the J ews  liv ing ther e, you began pr epar ing to fight agains t the Germ ans s hould 

they c ome.
 
> > Julius  Menn:  Oh, yeah. By es c aping into the m ountains.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And plus  s om e res is tanc e groups  were form ing. Right?
 
> > J ulius  
Menn:  Yes . I joined the res is tance when I was  15. One advantage, es pec ially I c an tell this  to 
you s inc e m ost of ar e you s c hool c hildr en
,  
is  we us ed to have m eetings  at night how to
 
--
 
in s ecr et 
plac es
 
--
 
to lear n how to handle various  weapons . I was  15. And I would c om e to c las s and it was  a big 
exam  that day. So I would tell the teac her I did my national duty
;  
I c annot take the exam.
 
> > [Laughter]
 
> > J ulius  Menn:  So that was  one advantage. You got out of taking many exam s . 
 
> > Bill Bens on: What was  your  father doing during that time? 
 
> > J ulius  Menn:  Well, my father
 
--
 
the c ement factory was
 
--
 
didn't work . He m anaged to buy, with a 
par tner who had the mone
y, a c er amic s factory from  a Syrian Sheikh. The Syrian Sheikh bought this  

m ac hiner y in Germ any befor e the war for his  s on but the s on eloped with a danc er to Mor oc c o. So 

c ons equently he s old the m ac hinery to my father at fir e sale.
 
So m y father was  pr oduc ing c heap China 
and ir rigation pipes . But when the war ended, the Br itis h im ported a lot of m uc h better  China s o he had 
to liquidate it.
 

15
 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And J ulius
 
--
 
our  tim e is  getting a little s hor t. As you m entioned, you were 15 when you 
joined the Haganah in 1944. Tell us what you did with that and what that meant for you to be par t of a 
r es is tan
c e.
 
> > J ulius  Menn:  Well, s inc e I was  only 15, the jobs  that I had when I was  until the undergr ound, we 

would put, at night, 
w
e would plas ter the walls  with s logans  and plac ards that s aid the Br itis h would get 
out, we want our  own c ountry. And if you wer e
 
arr es ted, the Britis h cr iminal polic e would beat you up. 
And they had a technique of beating you. They had thes e short s ticks, m ade out of s teel, c over ed with 

r ubber. And they would hit you on the kidneys  becaus e it would not s how any marks but it would r
uin 
your  kidneys . For tunately I was  never c aught. The older  kids who wer e s eniors  in s c hool ac tually 
handled weapons .
 
 
As  Bill mentioned, when I was  18, I c am e by m yself to the Univer s ity of Califor nia and enrolled 
ther e. And in the s umm er of 1948, I volunteer ed to go back  to fight in the War of Independenc e. So I'm 
a veteran of the War of Independence in 
`
48. I'm quite old. I'm 87.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  J ulius , after the war  was  over and you eventually m ade your  way to go to c ollege in 
Califor nia, as you just told us , when you dec ided to return to join the Arm y and the War of 
Independenc e, Isr ael, you s topped off in New York  and a party was  thrown for  you.
 
> > J ulius  Menn:  Oh, it was  very inter es ting.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Yeah, tell us  about that.
 
> > J ulius  Menn:  I
 
was  invited to this  party in the Br onx. The host invited a lot of G.I.s  fr om  the war . 
They wanted m e to tak e all of thes e ar m am ents  bac k  with m e but I c ould only take one pistol.
 
> > Bill B ens on
:  All of thes e veter ans c am e
 
--
 
> > J ulius  Menn:  Machine guns, r evolver s , all k inds of weapons. I c ould only take a pis tol.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Tell us
 
--
 
you wr ite about this in your  m em oir a lot. When you m ade that dec is ion to 
leave the first time and com e to Califor nia, r etur n, that was  a ver y diffic ult c hoic e for  y
ou to m ake.
 
> > J ulius  Menn:  It was . Bec aus e at that time I didn't partic ularly like my parents. And this is  very 
c om m on, I think. So I wanted to esc ape from  m y m other. And California, ther e were a lot of graduates , 

16
 
 
other gener ations, who went to the Univer s ity of Califor nia either  in Davis  or  in Berkeley. And they told 
m e, Califor nia, s uns hine state, it's like Pales tine and you c an always  get a job and it's  very c heap to go 

to s c hool.
 
 
I know the c ris is  now, school is  s o expens ive. I mus t tell you. When I went to Berkeley, as a 
r es ident of the s tate, you only paid
 
$60 a s emester . And there were two s emes ters a year . And als o 
you c ould take as  many units  as you wanted. Now Univer s ity of California, whic h is  alm ost broke, it c ost 

over
 
$13,000 for tuition a ye
ar .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  I'm going to ask you. Tell us  what wr iting your memoir has  meant to you. You've written 

"Waves" whic h hopefully you'll be able to s ign c opies  afterwar ds .
 
> > Julius  Menn:  The s tim ulus  to wr ite it was
 
--
 
I wrote it three, four years  ago
. My granddaughter, who 
lives  in Tucs on, Ar izona, s he wanted me to wr ite some m em oir for her and her  brother . And as I s at 

down to do this , I thought, well, I c ould wr ite a book . So I wrote about the firs t 20 years  of my life. I jus t 

never c ontinued.
 
>> Bi

Bill Bens on:  One las t ques tion before we tur n to our audienc e two ques tions , ac tually. How did the

One brother  died. I had

It's  very interesting. She was  s ent to

pic ture of J ulius  with you as  the back gr ound. And then onc e that's  done, J ulius  will head up the s tairs . 
So we want to m ak e s ure he gets  up ther e bec aus e he's going to s ign c opies  of his mem oir, "Waves ." 
So we want to m ak e s ure he's able to get up there in tim e for anybody who wants  to als o c hat with him  

at 
that time as well.
 
 
Befor e we tur n to J ulius  for your last word, let's s ee if we have s ome ques tions  fr om our

your  question. Hopefully we've got s om e brave s ouls  willing to do that try to make your question as

> > All right. So in the introduc tion it was  s aid that in Mas s ac hus etts  you've
 
given different sem inars  on

> > Bill Bens on:  The ques tion is

noting that you ar e now teac hing philos ophy in M

question is , How did you get into philos ophy? 
 

>> Jul

always  interes ted in it. Bec aus e really what philos ophy is  the ar t of intelligent dis c us s ion. So I was  

teac hing or running s eminar s  on 18th and 19th Century W

Bec aus e I'm sur e that m any of us have 
experienc ed c ertain difficulties  but m aybe not to the extent that you have. What c an you say that your  

attitude was  even as  a young per s on?
 
> > Bill Bens on:  As a high s c hool s enior, s ay, having been through all that you had been through, what 

was  your  attitude in ter ms  of going thr ough tr ans itioning of that life from  being a c hild to a young adult 

given all that you had experienc ed?
 

> > Julius  Menn:  It's  a very good ques tion. Unfortunately I'm 87 now; it's har d to r em em ber what it was  
like to be 19 or 20. But as  I s aid befor e, when you are ver y young, you are ver y elas tic  and plas tic
. S o 
you c an adapt. You forget bad things and you c oncentrate on the good.

I think  we are going to c los e our program now. So, again, after Julius  finishes , J oel will c om e 
up on the stage and I'm  going to ask  you stand at that point.We'll get Julius  heading up the s tairs  to 
s ign c opies  of 
his  book .
 
 
J ulius ? 
 
> > J ulius  Menn:  I was  asked to make s ome c oncluding c omm ents. I will tell you s omething that I said 

before. In Mas s ac hus etts  ther e ar e over  s ix million people. And when kids ask m e what was  the 
Holoc aus t like, I would say: Im agine you get up in the morning and all of the people of the state are 
dead. 
 
 
But in addition

s o this is ver y im portant. What is  als o important is that we s hould not forget 
that people c an do hor rendous  things to eac h other . The Holoc aus t was  run. In Darfur and 
Sudan there 

was  another  Holoc aus t. In Afric a ther e are m any Holoc aus ts  going on. They ar e not as well public ized 

as  the Holoc aust that happened to the J ews . But this  was  the first time in his tory that a whole people of

eth
n
ic  or igin wer e exterminated. And they wer e exter m inated in ter rible ways . Als o, hum an life was  not 
c ons idered as hum an. The Nazis  c ons idered J ews  as  les s than animals.
 
 
So I just want you to remember s omething, to make s ur e that we never have a Holoc aus t 
again.
