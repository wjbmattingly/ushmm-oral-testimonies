the name of the city in ch Œ in 
Cze choslovakia
, but he™s Czech born. And my 
mo ther i Œ was born in 
Poland
, in December of 1902. Her name was 
Czarna Steel.
 
And they were sort of distant cousins,
 so it was, as they say, a Œ a Œ a 
schitter
(ph). 
Q: It™s Œ yeah. And did 
you have any siblings? 
A: Oh Œ oh yes, I have
 a sister, her name is 
Helen Winchester, Henya

was her Polish name. And I have a brother, 
Arthur Spielman

as a family. 
Q: Let™s ha Œ let™s Œ before we talk about 
that, want to move back to life before the 
war, though. You were bor
n, you said, in 1939 Œ 
A: Nine. 

Q: Œ so Œ so you were born just as the 
war was beginning, so you probably  don™t 

have any memo ries from Œ 

A: Very, very Œ 
Q: Œ befo re, but Œ 
A: I have just very few of my own memori
es, and most of it, what I call memories 
were told to me.

rents and brother and sister said, what 
was your family™s life like in 
Poland
 before the war? Your father™s occupation Œ 
A: My father Œ 

Q: Œ cultural affiliations, religious affiliations Œ 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0570

A: My father was a sh oemaker. They were 
Œ we were an Orthodox family. We lived 
very well, we Œ we had help
. We were not considered po
or, but certainly we were 
not rich. And we had a Œ a tremendous ex
tended family. And some of the family 
were farmers, and Œ 
and butchers, and Œ 
Sho chets
, as they would say. And it was, I 
guess wh at you would picture of
 a normal Jewish family of 
Poland,
 which was 
very, very  nice. I was born in February
, wh ich was like six months before the 
Holocaust, so my memories of that time is Œ is Œ  
Q: Did your siblings 
go to school before? 
A: Oh yes. 
Q: And what type of school, was 
it a Jewish school, a Polish school? 
A: My brother went to 
chayder
 and my  sister, I believe she went to a gymnasium. 
But they  had normal schooling as well. I 
don™t recall too much about that, but yeah, 
my family was very learned. 

Q: And what language did you speak at home? 
A: Yiddish. Polish. That™s about it. 

Q: And am-among the family itself was mo stly Yiddish? 
A: Yes, mm-hm, mm-hm. 
Q: And okay, let™s now move to September 
™39, and I know that a lot of these are 
memo ries from your siblings
 and your parents, but fro
m wh at th ey ™v
e told you, 
what happened September ™39 
when the Germans invaded? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0570

A: Well, we were Œ we still were able to 
live in our home, but sh
ortly after that, we 
were put into a ghetto. And I believe that 
was in 1942. And we were placed in the 
ghetto, in  a one room place, and I think 
there were other people among us, and I 
don™t know how my  family™s Œ I™m 
diversing
 if you don™t mind. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: I don™t know how my fa
mily survived , because of me, because I was such a 
young baby. Most Œ well, I™ll 
go into that later, maybe. 
Q: And do you know, 
was your father working in 
the ghetto? Was he still working 
as a shoemaker, or Œ 
A: Yes, he had his own pl
ace, he was making Œ and ev er
ything was confiscated for 
him. And Œ and I believe how we survived
 was that he was making boots for the 
Gestapo. So  I Œ yeah .  
Q: And was your mother work ing in the 
ghetto also, or was she home with you? 
A: I Œ I Œ I think she was home with me, but she might have Œ and I Œ I Œ I cannot 

recall that at all, yeah. 

Q: And your older siblings, do you know 
where they wi Œ have any schooling, or 
were they work ing? 
A: In the ghetto, I think wh
en Œ once we were in the ghetto, I don™t think we had 
any schooling at all. No, it was very, very difficult, yeah. 
Q: And how long di
d your family stay in the ghetto? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0570 
7
 
 
A: Not very long, because wh
en my father first heard of the liquidation starting at 
the 
Kraków
 ghetto, he Œ he was an amazing man, I mu st say. He had foresight, if 
not luck , and he was able to send ma Œ send 
my  sister and brother out with a guy, to 
take them out of the ghetto and just take 
them away. I think th ere mi ght have been a 
destination, but I d Œ I don™t recall. It ha
d Œ there had to be. And Œ and my  father 
paid for th e guy to take my  sister and brother out. 
Q: Do you reme mb er what the emotional 
state was when they were leaving, and 
nobody knew Œ 
A: Above Œ yeah, my Œ my Œ 
Q: Œ wh at would happen? 
A: Œ yeah , my  father knew he
 would not see his children again. That Œ that was a Œ 
that was a given. And so I just cannot fath
om the emotions that were at that time. 
And I remained with my moth
er and father. I was just 
too young to be sent off. 
Q: So you were three years old then? 

A: I was about three years old, mm-hm. Then
 in Œ in  1940 Œ well, during that time 
also, ™42 - ™43, my  father saved a lot of people. 
Q: How did he do that? 
A: I™m Œ I™m not really certain, but being 
in that religious co
mmunity, I don™t know 
if you™re familiar with the 
Bobover Rebbe
?  
Q: Oh yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0570 
8
 
 
A: Are you? Okay. Well, I Œ I believe they
™re distantly related to us. And he was 
able to bring them into our place, and th
ey stayed with us while they liquidated 
other places. 
Q: This is the 
Halberstam
 family? 
A: Yes. 

Q: And how much of the Œ 
A: You just gave me the ch ills. How do you know them? 
Q: I™ve been  studying th e 
Bobovers. [indecipherable]
 So, wh at was the connection 
between your family and th e fami ly of the 
Bobover Rebbe
? And how did your 
father Œ what did he do for Rabbi
 Halberstam
? 
A: I™m really not sure. Oh, now I have to 
find out a lot more. 
Oh my  gosh, oh my  
gosh. I definitely Œ as a matter of fact, 
my  brother called me this afternoon and I 
didn't  get a chance to talk 
to him. And he would be th
e one to know, my  brother 
knows everything. He reme mb
ered the streets, and the 
shops and everything that 
went on in 
Kraków
. He knew hundreds of people, 
and he knew th e whole fami ly. 
He would Œ he was interviewed, I think by spe Œ 
Spielberg
. I don™t know if he was 
interviewed by the Œ was he interviewed by
 the Holocaust, do you know Œ oh. He Œ 
he would make a great interview. But, so 
these are some of the things that he has 
told me. But Œ 
Q: Yeah. So, what me
mory do you have of your fa
ther and what he was doing to  
help other Jews? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0570 
9
 
 
A: Very little. He saved, I know, two cous
ins. Two cousin, my two first cousins. 
One wa Œ was sent to 
Israel
 on one of the first 
Aliyahs
. And then  I have another 
cousin who lives in
 Chicago
, and she was sent with 
the you Œ youth Œ youth 
organization to the 
States
, cause we did have family in the 
States
, so she was able 
to come on one of the fi
rst immigration trips.  
Q: But, you were saying a minute ago that the
 Bobover Rebbe
 got into the ghetto Œ 
A: Well, yeah, he ge Œ 
Q: What do you know about that? 

A: Very little Œ 
Q: But Œ 
A: 
J udy , 
I™m trying, I™m trying very hard. I know
 they stayed with
 us. They stayed 
with us, and when the Œ when 
it got to be very, very danger
ous, my father again sent 
them out. Where to, I don™t know. And at th
at time, my father had Czech papers, so 
he was fairly safe, and we were able to 
get Œ once the ghetto was being liquidated, 
we were able to cross over to 
Cze choslovakia
. 
Q: Do you have any memo ry of 
how you escaped 
from the ghetto? 
A: Very carefully. And Œ 

Q: Was it night, or is it day? 

A: I believe it was at night, and we cro
ssed the border. And I have a very, very 
vague story. That™s one of my rarest little
 me mo ries, but again, it might have been 
told to me as well. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0570 
10
 
 
Q: That™s okay. 
A: We were crossing the Œ a border and 
of course it was guarded , but my  Œ my  
father had th e papers, and we were st
opped. And they  asked us all sorts of 
questions, and I was three or f
our years old. And they  were
 talking to me, and I said 
Œ I was whimpering. And I said, my father 
is a goy, my  mo ther is goy, but I™m 
Jewish. And I was three, four years old, 
and they let us through. I Œ that™s Œ 
Q: And when you got to 
Czechoslovakia
, wh ere did you go? 
A: We stayed Œ we stayed in 
Czechoslovakia
 for a little while. I don™t recall th at at 
all. But soon after, we were able to get to 
Hungary, 
to  
Miskolc, Hungary.
 Well, 
first to 
Budapest. 
And from 
Budapest
 we went to 
Miskolc.
 I don™t rememb er 
Budapest,
 but I do remember 
Miskolc.
 We lived there as Gen
tiles for about a year.  
Q: And at this time, did you have any k
nowledge that your br
other and sister had 
survived ? Had you had any contact with them? 
A: Okay, in between that, th
ere Œ they were sent to an
 orphanag e. And my  father 
heard, or Œ or somebody had heard that th
ings were really happening. Whether my  
father knew where they were, or they were
 supposed to, but he didn™t know wh ether 
they were alive, but if they
 were, this is where they 
would Œ would have been. He 
sent a guide out there, and that was the 
day they were liquidating the orphanage. 
And Œ 

Q: And this is in 
Miskolc,
 or Œ 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0570 
11
 
 
A: I am not sure whether it was in 
Czechoslovakia
, or whether it was in 
Hungary. 
I™m not sure. And the gar Œ 
the guide knew  who they  were, and he went Œ first it 
was my  brother, and he said, follow me. Do
n™t talk, don™t say anything, just follow 
me. And as they walked out,
 they Œ the Nazis came in and took th e other children. 
And I think Œ I believe the 
same thing happened to 
Henya
(ph), my sister
 Helen
, 
and they were able to walk out of the 
orphanage, and they brought them to my  

parents. 
Q: Do you remember the reunion? 

A: No, I do not. You know, a lot of things  seems to be repre Œ repressed in my  
mind, and I get so upset with myself, so i
rritated that I cannot have those memo ries. 
I would do anything to Œ to really know 
how I felt, how my  parents felt, or Œ you 
know Œ 
Q: So th en Œ 
A: Œ the rest of th
em. So, we lived in 
Miskolc
 for about a year as Gentiles. 
Q: All five of you? 
A: Five of us, five of us. And as I said, 
we lived Œ lived as ge
nt Œ we had a house, 
and in the house we had a cross, because we
 lived as Œ as Gentiles. And I remember 
being in the basement of the house, or Œ 
we went out to a shelter in  a cave or 
somewhere, and Œ and the Russians came in
 and th ey bomb ed the whole town , or 
the area where we lived. The only house st
anding was ours. The cross came d o wn, 
smacked in smithereen s, and the house wa
s standing. There was a c rack though, but 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0570 
12
 
 
that was the only house standing in  our neig
hborhood. So, to me 
that was absolutely 
miraculous. 
Q: And then  did you remain in
 the town after the bombing? 
A: We stayed Œ we stayed there for aw
hile. Well, we Œ during th e bombing, my  Œ 
my  Œ my  mo ther sent my  brother out to
 get bread, there was a tremendous bread 
line. And he would bring ho
me rotten bread, or wh atever kind of bread we could 
get, and the bombs were fa
lling, and you know. And my  
mo ther would prepare this 
bread in rancin Œ rancid oil that we kept 
so we could, you know,
 fry the bread. And 
the only food we had was garlic
. So we would have this 
rotten bread and rancid  oil 
with Œ sp read with garlic. And you know 
Judy
, it was the most delicious thing in 
the world. But, soon after that, when the 
war Œ we were liberated by the Russians. 
And soon after that, I g u ess it was early part
 of 1946, I think it was the year Œ I™m 
not sure what part of the year it was, but
 my  brother and my  father decided they 
would go back to
 Poland.
 We remained in Œ in 
Hungary.
 I don™t remember th at. 
But my  brother and fath er went, and he 
came back with stories that were just 
incredible. That was the time of the pogrom
s. Soon after the war, when Jews were 
coming back to
 Poland
, and my  father and brother went
 to see our house, and they 
knocked on the door, and so
me Polish people were living there, and they slammed 
the door in his face, saying, 
you were supposed to be dead . So at that Œ right after 
that, this pogrom had started, and they 
escaped by this much
 from getting killed. 
They survived the 
war, but they were so scared that
 they would Œ yeah. So, we went 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0570 
13
 
 
back Œ they went back  to 
Hungary
 and my father told my
 mo ther, there™s nothing 
there for us. 
Q: So Œ 
A: And at that time my father, he surviv
ed the whole war without being arrested, 
but at that time he was arrested by the Ru
ssians. Because my  father was bootlegging 
at that time, and the Russian soldiers got sick from Œ from this drink, and they 
arrested my  father for selli
ng bad liquor to the Russians. 
Q: How long was he in jail for? 
A: Not Œ not terribly long, not terribly long.
 But, he had to make a living, right? 
Q: So, how long did you remain in
 Hungary
 after the war? 
A: Well, we Œ we left soon after that, because I know we were in 
Gabersee, 
a 
DP 
camp in 
Germany
 for three years. So, we left that
 in 1949. Excuse 
me. So we must 
have left 
Hungary
 in ™46. 
Q: And did you have a
ny trouble getting out of 
Hungary
? 
A: I don™t recall that at all, I think we 
were just Œ you know, we made arrangements 
and we were placed in a 
DP
 camp. And we were there for three years, and even 
though we had family here in the 
States
, it was Œ I™m sure, you know, it took 
forever to get the papers, and Œ 
Q: What was life like in the
 DP
 camp? 
A: From what I remember as a child, it wa
s okay. I had friends, I had schooling, I 

had food. I was a little bit of
 nothing, and so that was life, and it was good. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0570 
14
 
 
Q: And di Œ and did 
your parents have enough to do in th e 
DP  
camp? 
A: Well, my fath Œ ma Œ my father wo
rked, my mother stay
ed at home, and I 
remember at that time my sister
 and brother wanted to  make 
Aliyah
 to 
Israel.
 And 
oh, they cried to go to 
Israel. 
But, you know, they were go
od kids, it was all family, 
you know, and my  mother said, absolu tely 
not. She was tired of fighting, she was 
tired of being scared, and she wants pe
ace in her life and she didn't want her 
children going to 
Israel
 and fighting another war. So, 
that™s how they remained 
with us, you know, that we stayed as
 a family  unit. So
 we came to the 
States
 in 
1949. 
Q: Did an yone sponsor you? 
A: Well, we had the family. We had my au
nt and unc Œ two aunts and an  uncle ra Œ 
oh, no, we ha Œ that time we
 still had quite a bit of family left. We were a huge 
family. My father had a brother, tw o sisters.
 One sister with a hu
sband, and an uncle 
who I Œ I hate to mention, that wer Œ that were in
 New York.
 And we had other 
relatives th -through the 
States
. So we stayed with them
 for awhile til we Œ til we 
settled. But we arrived in 
New York
 harbor on a Shabbat, and cousins came to pick 
us up. My father would not get off the ship
. He would not Œ it™s Shabbat, he is not 
going in  a car, he™s not Œ you know. So here
 after Œ after 10 years of suffering, he 
would not get off the ship. So
 my cousins left, and they 
came back a little bit later 
and they  said, if you don™t get off the 
boat now, we™re not coming back and get you. 
So finally he™s Œ he Œ he Œ he was Œ he
 was the sweetest man Œ so finally he 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0570 
15
 
 
consented to get off the ship and we came to my  aunt™s house, 
Tante Eda
(ph). And 
it was the beginning of a new life. But he Œ 
he Œ he Œ his faith was so very strong. 
Q: And he stayed a Œ a Hassid? 
A: Mm-hm, mm-hm. 

Q: And what about your sib
lings? Did their faith change
 at all through th e war? 
A: Somewhat. Their children ar
e Œ are very religious, all of
 their children. My sister 
and brother-in-law are very Œ 
yeah, but they ™re not Hassidic
 
or any Œ and that™s a Œ 
neither is my brother, but th
eir children are very, very 
[indecipherable]
. And 
wonderful, beautif
ul family, yeah. 
Q: Where in 
New York
 did you settle? 

A: In
 Brooklyn. Bensonhurst
, yeah. 
Q: And talk about th Œ what was it like as 
a young child all of a sudden moving to a 

new country with a new language? Did you ha
ve any trouble adju sting to  life in the 
United States? 
A: I was scared of a new language becaus
e I was able to pick it up no matter where 
we were I spoke hungar Œ not that I 
know it now. But I spoke German and 
Hungarian and Polish a
nd you know, a little Œ a 
bissell
(ph) here and a 
bissell
(ph) 
there. But when I came to 
America
, I said, oh I™m Œ I Œ I don™t know if I can learn 
the language, I was really scared. And my 
cousin insisted that I only speak English 
in front of him, or wherever I was going. An
d then I fo rgot all the other languages. I 
just never retained it. But my pare
nts took English when we were in 
Gabersee
 in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0570 
16
 
 
the 
DP
 camp, and they had a tuto
r come to the house. We had a one room place, 
and he wo uld come to the house and teach
 my  parents English,
 but it was English 
English, so it was some
what different than wh
en we came to the 
States
. But it never 
helped, th ey wer Œ th ey managed with Œ 
with whatever they 
could speak. Bu t one 
thing about my  father, may he
 rest in peace, and God love him a million years, we 
came on a Shabbat, on a sa Œ Monday he already had a job. 

Q: Was he able to work in
 his own field, shoemaker? 
A: Shoemaker, mm-hm, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Q: And what was the reception of the other 
children at school to the fact that you 
were a newcomer from another country ? Di
d they accept you imme diately, or Œ 
A: Ah, I never looked for it. I know Œ I ha
d a small group of friends, but I didn™t 
have an ex tended group, so I ne Œ I never 
really looked into that. And I remember 
being in one class, where the teacher calle
d upon me and asked for me to speak in 
front of the class, and I really couldn™t b
ecause I was so foreign, it was so unrelated 
to the classroom atmosphere. I was very di
fficult, I Œ I Œ I™ve always told bits and 
pieces, but I never Œ yeah. I don™t know if I™m
 even helping you w
ith this interview. 
Q: Right, yeah. Oh, very much. And 
your family, once they came to the 
United 
States, 
did they ever talk about 
the war years, or did they just put it behind them? 
A: Not for awhile, not for aw
hile. Maybe they ta
lked to their fam
ily  privately, like 
to their sist er Œ their si ster
s. My mo ther did not have fa
mily here Œ she had a cousin , 
I take that back. Sh e had a Œ a Œ a Œ a very Hassidic cousin and an  extended family. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0570 
17
 
 
She did have a brother in 
Israel
 that settled there in 1933, but here in the 
States
, it 
was mo stly my  father™s family. So, I™m su
re they talked among th emselves, but not 
really openly, not til later on. Not til later on.  
Q: 
[indecipherable]
 different question. At wh ich po
in t do you start to identify Œ did 
it strike you that you were a Holo caust 
survivor and not just an immigrant? 

A: Oh my God, it took years. 
Q: Why was that? 
A: It Œ I™ll tell you ex actly. Oh, I Œ it took years, and I know exactly  wh en I realized 

that. A number of years ago, there as a Holocaust renu Œ reunion here in 
Washin gton 
at the convention center. You must ha
ve been a baby 
then. I forget 
what year it was. I™ll tell you later. ™69, or
 maybe seven Œ well, when a Œ and I tried 
to get involved with that, I begged my  husba
nd to get involved 
with that. And we 
sang Œ we went to the Œ President
 Reagan 
spoke then  Œ no, so it must have been  
much later, was in the 80s. 
Ok ay, early 80s. And President 
Reagan 
spoke in front 
of the Ho locaust reunion group. And I si
gned up for a few seminars at the 
convention center in 
D.C.
 And I attended th e second 
generation seminar. I don™t 
know what made me d o  th
at, but they spoke on childre
n surviving, and families 
surviving. And I finally realized Œ the reas
on I wanted to get involved in this thing 
was because I just felt it. But what I realiz
ed at that time, and 
realized that I am a 
survivor, was that families of
 my  Œ of my  generation, did not surviv e. I realized I 

was very unique and very rare, because ch
ildren my  age did not surv ive. And Œ and

my  siblings as well, my sister and brothe
r, who were sent out to God knows where. 
And how they reunited with their parents, 
and how my father survived all that. We 
were very unique, and I cherish that in my 
Œ in my  head , I Œ I could not believe that 
as a family unit we 
surv ived , you know? So
 that™s when I rea
lized I™m a Holocaust 
survivor. We were in no camp. We were in
 no labor camp, but I think we survived 
many Œ 
Q: And do you think th at affected the 
choices you made later in life, that 
realization? 
A: That I-I realized I™
m a Holocaust survivor? 
Q: Or, having gone thro ugh the Ho locaust. 

A: Selfishly, I feel lik e I™m a very special person. Bu t my  everyd
ay life is, I™m just 
as normal as you or anybody else. But wh en 
I look back on it, I feel very special. I 
wish my  husband would feel that way. He™s
 the silent one. He does not discuss it. 
So it makes our feelings very, very diffi
cult. And th ings that I would get mo re 
involved  in, that I would like to get mo re 
involved in, I feel like I can™t because I™m 
not getting his support. And he
 wouldn™t Œ he won™t accept my support. He lost his 
entire family, so he™s Œ he™s Œ he keeps ev
erything inside. And it Œ I think he did a 
lot of damage to our ch ildren because he 
wasn™t open with them
. But they always 
pursu e, they always ask questions. But I fi
nd that a very, very difficult part of my 

life, yeah. My brother-in-law, he was liberated in 
Auschwitz
, and for many, many, 
many years he would not speak of it. Li
ke, I think it was a normal thing of many 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0570

survivors at that time. But a few years a
go, all of a sudden, everything came out. 
Everything came out. And he had a 
tremendous i-interview with 
Spielberg
 and the 
Œ I believe the Holocaust Museum as well
, an extended one.
 He made several 
donations to the museum. I th
ink one of his shirts is 
hanging there. It™s Œ it™s 
different than the others. I™m
 sure you have en ough of th
em there. S o , sometimes I 
envy people who can really speak out and 
be noticed fo r what they  went thro ugh, 
where my husband is Œ yeah, I fi
nd that very, very difficult. 
Q: And he was from which city? 
A: He was from 
Kalomaya
(ph). It was 
Poland 
at that time, but that area seems to 
be changing from the 
Ukraine
, to 
Poland,
 to
 Russia
, to 
Ukraine.
 I think it™s 
Ukraine 
now. Bu t he was born 
Kalomaya
(ph), 
Poland, 
yeah. 
Q: Let me just ask if you have any other last
 thoughts, anything th
at we didn™t talk 
about, that you would 
like to talk about? 
A: During th e Ho locaust period? 

Q: 
[indecipherable]
 During the Holocaust, or the ye
ars right afterwards, coming to 
the 
United States. 
A: It was like a dream come true coming to  the 
United States
, because of all the 
availability of food and Œ a
nd whatever we had. Clean be
d. I remember getting into 
a bed, into a nice, clean sheet. That was Œ 
that was just delicious, it™s just delicious. 
And Œ and taking baths, that was delic
ious. And Œ but during the war years, I 
reme mb er a few p o in ts wh ere my  mo th er h a
d the most difficult hardships. How she 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0570

had to be sent to the hosp
ital because she had a Œ oh, wh
at do you call it? Appendix. 
She had to have an appendix taken out. 
And how that came about, I Œ I don™t remem 
Œ I Œ I don™t know how she even surviv ed 
that. And th en one time we were crossing 
a Œ a border where she fell and just the di
fficulty of it all. And when I watch all 
these Holocaust movies and stories, so Œ na
 Œ well, I cannot do all of them. I choose 
and pick wh ich ones I want to
 watch, and I don™t put my se
lf in it. I Œ I Œ I can™t do 
that, because it™s just 
so horrible. So I don™t put myself
 in it. It™s like surreal, yeah. 
So, I hope I was able to help y
ou. I Œ I Œ I really Œ yeah .  
Q: Thank you. 
A: Oh, you Œ you™re very
 sweet, thank you. 
Q: Thank you very much. 
And this concludes the 
United States 
Holo caust 
Memorial Museum interview with 
Ba rbara Firestone.
 Thank you.
