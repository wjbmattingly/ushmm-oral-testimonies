 
Interview with Catherina Polak 
On her parents. 
 
Q: We  are interviewing Mrs. Polak about her parent
s.  Let™s start with your father. Would you tell 
me  your father ™s full name  and his date of bi
rth and where he was bor
n, and anything you mi ght 
know about his family.  
 

A: My father ™s name  wasAbraham Soe p, the Dutc
h word for soup, which was not a nice name  to 
go out with as a child, as you can imagine.  He was born onApril 17, 1892.  
 

Q: Anything else?   Do you know anything 
about his childhood, about his family?  
 

A: I don™t know too much about his childhood.  I kn
ow that his mother was very young when she 
ma rried.  His father started a diamond factory 
which was built, I guess with money from his 
father.  Before that as far as I know, they were
 cigar ma kers. They were out of poorAshkenazi 
background.  But the diamond factory was a succ
ess and they became well to do later.  My 
grandmother I reme mber very well.  She was a 
very wise person but very uneducated.  She had 
an inner wisdom but she didn™t know much about
 anything.  My grandfather died when I was 
four so I don™t reme mbe r  him too well.  I think he  was quite a bit more intelligent.  My father 

was the oldest.  He was born ten years after hi
s parents were ma rried. They couldn™t have 
children. They adopted or took in a niece, a sist
er of my grandfather 
had one child after the 
other and did not know how to take care of them, so
 they took one of those children as a child, 
who I consider my aunt and my father who 
was born after ten years 
of marriage after the 
adoption, considered her his sister.  She was quite a 
bit older. Then they had four other children 
who all died before age one for diffe r ent reas
ons.  One had diphtheria, another was dropped by 
some body else and horrible stories that never really
 was talked about becaus
e in those days a lot 
of people lost a lot of children. And then my
 unc le was born who was ten years younger than 
my father.  His name  was Hans Soep and he wa
s a very sickly child. They thought they were 
going to lose him, but they didn™t. Where my fa
ther was this tall, broad heavy person. My uncle 
was the opposite.  He wa s small and very small boned and small build. They got along well.  

My uncle looked up to my father a 
lot and really was always a littl
e bit in the shadow.  He went 
into business, after schooling he 
went into business with my fath
er, as a partner, or a junior 
partner.  My father had three years of high school, 
which at that time  was  r
eally quite a bit.  It 
was an offic i al three-year course
 high school and after he finished he went into business with 
his father.  His father died at the age of 64 a
nd his mother died in the beginning of the war in 
1942, I think. What else do you want to know about them? 
 

Q: I think we have most of the story. 

 

A My mother was from a family of six children.  She was born on December 8, 1895, her name  is 
Toni Fredrika Kauffman was her ma iden name
.  Everybody called herToni.  She came from a 
very liberal fa mily.  My father came from an orthodox fa mily, but when he ma rried my father, 

she became a dutiful kosher housewife and later 
on took an interest in Hebrew.  She took 
Hebrew lessons conversation lesso
ns to learn the language.  Her 
parents were Germa n but they 
had moved t o Holland in the 1880™s and the six ch
ildren were all born in Holland. The oldest 
one, I think, in ™87, and there was a span of twen
ty years between the ol
dest and the youngest.  
One of my a unts is still alive a
nd lives in Israel, the youngest one w
ho is going to be 85 in May.  
And we are all going to Israel, all the nieces an
d nephews that are still there for a reunion..  She 

was a dutiful housewife, it was a very good ma rri
age, but my father was a very dominant 
person, not of ma ny wor ds but his 
whole being was a little author
itarian. But my mot her was 
perfectly happy in her role and not until after 
he died, which was in 1953, and she live d until 
1980, not until a few years after he  died did she 
become  her own person and showed a lot more 
personality and initiative and ev
erything than I had ever seen before. We  were on very good 
terms all the time. 
 

Q: How was she as a mother when you were growing up? 

 

A: We ll, when we were growing up she was, you know, like a mother should be. Ve ry nurturing, 
but we lived in a fairly big house and we had tw
o ma ids and one of them was more or less what 
they call a ﬁkinder fraulein.ﬂ They all came  fr
om Ger many.  They took care of the children.  
And there was a cleaning woman and there was a seam
stress. There were a lot of people to take 
care of us.  My father traveled
 a lot because in the diamond busin
ess he went every other week 
to Belgium to sell.  Once a month to England, to London, to buy.  He was on lots of 

committees, so my mother was often alone with 
us.  But she was kind of a, she doesn™t  stand 
out in my mind as a child.  I always used to 
say as a child, I™m not 
being brought up I™m just 
growing up by myself.  I felt kind of independe
nt, I guess, from my young years on.  But not 
realizing it I probably wa sn™t , but it seemed th
at way.  But she was very sweet.  Everybody 
loved her.  She was a real lady.  She looked lik
e a lady, and she was cultured.  She came from a 
cultured background than my father.  She was fond of
 music, she played the piano quite nicely.   
She spoke beautifully French.  My father took 
an interest later in music and became  very 
musically inclined.  I think he
 played the violin when he was a young boy so there must have 
been some thing there already. They traveled qu
ite a bit without us, which we resented when we 
were children. When we  used to complain, my
 mother used to say in a Ge rman expression 
which her mother used to say to her, you just tr
avel with your own husband. 
That™s  about all I  
can say about my mother from the early year
s. About my sister, she is still alive. 
 

Q: In that case, I need to talk to her. 

 

A: Do it yourself.  She has lots and lots of problem
s.  I don™t think they rela
te to the war.  She™s 
been a problem her whol e life.  She doesn™t have
 a very happy present life.  She lives in Los 
Angeles.   She™s a very strong, determined person, but it™s  lots of problems. 
 

Q: Can we go on a talk about these two friends? 

 

A: Ye s, let™s talk about these two friends.  One 
of them RudiAcohen who 
was really my boyfriend.  
I me t hi m when he was 13 and I was 12. We  lived next to each other during the summer at the 

summer resort.  Our parents had rented homes. 
 

Q: What was the name  of that resort? 

 

A: Zandvoort and it™s very close toAmsterdam.  
My father commuted every day from business by 
car, because the chauffeur came and picked him up 
and brought him. That™s what was done in 
those days.  He also went to Montessori Hi
gh School, but a differen
t one from mi ne, and I 
reme mber hearing his name  when in June ™35 we
 went to visit our M
ontessori High School for 
the first time just for orientat
ion and everybody™s name  was me n
tioned. I thought what a strange 
name  this boy has. And then we went a few 
weeks later to Zandvoort and who lives next door, 

the boy with the strange name, and we were very
 crazy about each other, even when that young, 

and you know, like children are we played together. 
 We  played ball, we went to the dunes, we 
went swimmi ng and then he was in my class for 
several years and then he was transferred to 
another school.  He wasn™t  enti
rely a good student and couldn™t  st
ay in our school.  But I stayed 
very fr iendly with him.Actually ‚til he was arrest
ed also in a raid.Again 
a reprisal  raid in July 
™42, just before the deportation started. Also a 
German soldier had been killed and they emptied 
that whole street of all 
the Jews.  One very long street, verynice residential street, went in every 
home where there were Jews and arrested them. 
 
Q: Do you know what year Rudi was born? 

 

A: Ye s.  His birthday was June 4, and he was born in 1922. 

 

Q: Did he have any other interests,
 did he have musical interests? 
 

A: No.  He also played tennis and he played th
e violin, he had violin lessons.  He liked popular 
music, records. 
 

Q: Do you remember any in part
icular, or anything like that? 
 

A: We ll, we listened a lot to French songs, 
like CharlesTr unet (?)You probably don™t even know 
that name .  He was very popular then, and also 
Austrian songs like Marta Keller, I think that 
was her name.  No, that was not her name . We  
listened toAmerican songs.   Frank Sinatra was 
big. We  played a lot of classical records. We  
had an old fashioned player.  For his Bar Mitzvah 
he got a record player, you know, that you turned
 a handle to play, and we played a lot of 
classical mu sic. What else?   I don™t know. We
 did what young people do. We  went on trips, 
bike trips and stuff like that.  He was caught in on
e of those raids and that was the end of hi m.  
The day after he was arrested, he was sent on 
oAuschwitz or wherever.  I never heard from 
him. With his parent s and his brother.  I even 
went in a day or  two after because I worked for 
the Jewish Council in that departme nt that was 
called Aids to Departi
ng People and I was able 
to send some stuff toWe sterbork because most pe
ople stayed.  But later on I heard they weren™t 
even there. And, of course, he never came back. And I didn™t know that at the time during all 

those years, all of the sudden he mi ght be b
ack.  He was young and everything, of course we 
realized that he probably didn™t live three days afterwards. 
 

Q: What month was that? 

 

A: It was June 1942 and it was just
 after his birthday.  It was a Sunday. And I am trying to look 
back, his birthday was on June 4, 1942 and whatev
er the Sunday was afte
r that; I think it was 
June 9
th
, it was that date.  He had just turned 20.
  He had a younger brother who was very, very 
bright and very, very musical, was about three or
 four years younger than 
him.  Of course, he 
went, his parents, everybody. A
nd then, after that I had some  so
rt of a boyfriend, his name  was 
Hans Rudelshim, and he was born in
 Ka mpen, which was near ___________, __________.  I 
don™t know when his birthday was.  He was very in
teresting.  He went in
to hiding a lot.  His 
father was a tailor, and he was a good tailor too.  
AS a ma tter of fact he 
remodeled some  sports 
clothes of my father for my sister
 and me into skirts and little t
op and he was also a very gifted 
pianist and he took some  piano lessons from a 
blind Hungarian pianist 
who lived in Holland.  
Wa s also caught in Holland and who used to prac
tice when he couldn™t play concerts anymore.  
He used to give house concerts of the piano and 
he practiced at my parents™ house. We  had a 

grand piano. And he got to know this friend 
of mi ne and he taught and gave him lessons 

 
Q: Do you know what year Hans was born? 

 

A: I think probably also in 1922, it ma y have been ™
21.  He ma y have been a year older, and he had 
to leave Kampen ________, like all th
e people from the Provinces were sent.  He looked very 
Jewish.  He dyed his hair blond and went into
 hiding and did all kinds of reckless things, 
traveled and went everywhere. A nd, of course, they were betrayed. 
 

Q: Do you know when that was? 

 

A: I don™t know exactly when that was. We  were s
till in our house and we le
ft there in May ™43, so 
it must have been February or March ™43.  I don™t  know what happened to him.  Never heard a 

word.  He was sent away. And then this othe
r picture here is of a young ma n na me d Gideon, we 
called him in Dutch, it™s called ﬁChideonﬂ, and 
we called him ﬁChi.ﬂ He was from a very 
prominent Dutch gentile fa mily. They were orig
inally Huguenots, therefore the French name .  
We  were very good friends. We  wer e  in the sa
me grade.  He was a very good friend of my 
boyfriend, Rudi . In the very beginning I hear of the Dutch Nati
onal Socialist Moveme nt in the 
early ‚30™s, a lot of people became members of this Nazi group.  Even Jews, because they 

thought, you know, it was a good system and very or
derly and everything.  Before we knew all 
the stuff that was going to happen, but his family 
eventually, of course, 
totally abandoned this 
and they were very, very good and had ma ny Je wish
 friends.  He went into the Resistance and 
hid Jews.  His father was sent away and died i
n, I think it was Buchenwa
ld or Dachau, one of 
the two.  His mother was in Ravensbruck, surv
ived, came back a wreck and lived for quite a 
few years as a wreck, and never really got over all of this. 
 

Q: Can you tell us anything about either Gideon or
 Hans, or both, and Rudi, what were they like?  
What was their personalities like? 
 

A: We ll, you know when you grow up together as
 children you don™t delve that much in the 
personalities or whatever.  He was just also no
t the greatest of students, but a very sweet guy 
and fun. We  had a lot of fun together. We  we
re young, we had parties. We  organized our own 
parties. We  decided whether we would go formal
 to this party or should we  go another way.  
Everybody brought their best reco
rds and we played and we danced. We  had very happy 
teenage years.  It was mo stly for fun. A
lthough I do reme mbe r  though once we were in high 
school that we had very deep conversation su
bject about the incarna
tion or vivisection, you 
know, experime nts on animals. Who was for and who was against. You know, like teenagers 

who go to a decent school do.  But it was mostly just
 friends together all th
e time.  I spent really 
all my years in high school with my friends rath
er than with my fa mily. We  did our home work, 
but it ha d to be done quick because then we woul
d get together and play records and talk and 
have fun.  Of course girls were 
involved.  He had a girlfriend too. 
 

Q: Hans, how did he fit in with the circle? 

 

A: No, Hans really didn™t move toAmsterdam unt
il the war was already on, and his uncle was a 
physician inAmsterdam and they were the best frie
nds of Rudi™s  parents.  So I knew him really 
through Rudi. And then Rudi was deported, you know
, he went after me , because he liked me  
from the beginning.  So some how that™s how all th
ese people fit in.  I mean these are just three 

of them.  I s howed you a little tenn
is picture, there were several 
more we were always together 
with. These were really after school fr iends. 

 
Q: What was Rudi like? 

 

A: Rudi was a very nice down to earth, rather
 simple kind of guy, I think. You don™t know.  I 
some ti me s wonder what would he have been or b
ecome .  He  was as I said he didn™t have very 

good head for learning, but his father was a stockbr
oker and I think he could have become  that 
too.  He was interested in business and everything.  But there wasn™t  muc h time for 

development yet. You know, we were both 16 wh
en the war broke out in
 Europe and 17 when 
Holland was invaded. We  were kids.  I mean 
even today 16 and 17 years old, and they are 
much more sophisticated than we were, but even 
they are little kids, while they know more of 
what goes on in the world, you know, with televisi
on. We  didn™t have television, of course. We  
didn™t have a radio in the house 
until I was 14.  If I wanted to
 hear children™s programs on the 
radio, I walked 25 mi nutes to my grandmother ™s 
everyTuesday afternoon to hear children™s  
programs. We  were not really spo
iled kids.  It wa
sn™t  that much. 
 

Q: Is there anything else?   I know I™ve picked your
 brain and put you through th
e wringer.  Is there 
anything else you would like to add? 
 

A: There™s pr obably a million things I can add, you have to st op so me where. 

 

Q: Thank you very, very much. 

 

A: You™reverywelcome.
