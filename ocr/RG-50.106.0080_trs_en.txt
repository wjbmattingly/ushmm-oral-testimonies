October 22, 1997 
 
Question: This is the 
United States Holocaust Memorial Museum 
volunteer 
collection interview with 
Bernard Pasternak
, conducted by 
Esther Finder
 on 
October 22
nd
, 1997, in 
Rockville, Maryland
. This is a follow-
up interview to a 
U.S. Ho loca ust Memorial Mu seum 
videotape interview conducted with
 Bernard 
Pasternak
 on April 20
th
, 1994. This is tape one, side 
A
. I would like to have you 
speak to me today a little bit about yo
ur liberation and your post-Holocaust 
experiences. Can you tell me  about the day th
at you realized that you were free, and 
no lo nger under Nazi contro l? 
Answer: Well, have to give me a couple of
 seconds, to turn th
e clock back, to tell 
you about it. The first thing on the libera
tion, I noticed a lot of noise and I didn™t 
know from where the noise is coming. 
Then  I heard people are saying the 
Americans are here, the Americans are here
. But some people who were saying the 
Americans are here, they were from far aw
ay the noise, because inside on th e camp  
there was still 
SS
, try to get people up, to keep on
 going for the death march, keep 
on going. So  I could not go any mo re beca
use of wa Œ was very weak. I don™t know, 
maybe have 60 or 65 pounds. So  what I did,
 I saw bodies, dead bodies laying there, 
and I figure I™m gonna go between the dead  bodies, in the middle there and I had a 
weak spot on my  nose, which all Œ blood 
always comed Œ it came out. So what I

did, wh atever what I had, I hit my  nose, and I fulled it out with blood, and my  
mouth was full of blood wh en th e Nazis came around to  try to drag  the people out. 

So first of all, the people 
who did not want to
 get up, they  shot them on the pla Œ 
they killed them. So wh
en they came to me 
and they saw that I still have a little life 
in it, so the other guy says, don™t waste your bullets 
[indecipherable]
. So they kept 
on going. And then a little bit later, the Am
ericans liberated, but 
they did not come 
in the camp. That was all on the outside. 
The thing were t Œ wh
en  I got up already, 
how did I get out there? There was a lot of
 other people who were a little stronger, 

and they  went around the camp  and th ey st
art running, and th ey start saying, we are 
liberated, we are liberated, you could get 
up. Whoever lays down  there who could 
get up, get up because we are liberate fro
m th e Americans. I never know just how 
the system works in 
Œ in the army , because I never wa
s in the army. The first thing 
when I got up, I went outside a little bit, I 
saw the American soldiers in there, and I 
was told that™s General 
Patton
 over there. I said, who™s 
Patton
? I never know this Œ 
those kind of names, because
 we never heard it. And th
en later on I find out all 
whatever happened, how he came there a
nd what he came there. And su ddenly  a 
few soldiers came out, American soldier, an
d they start talking Yiddish me. They 
say, are you Jewish? I say yes. He says, who else i s here ? I said, the y  all Jew, a ll 
around me, they all Jewish people over here
. Then he start talking, and the first

thing they tried 
[indecipherable]
 chocolate, chewing gum, they tried 
[indecipherable]
 the thing was interesting, th
e chewing gum, I took a lot of 
packages in, but they Œ I Œ I Œ til it was 
sweet. And when it wasn™t more sweet, I 
swallow it. Then I got sick, because I 
didn™t know. And then
 the guy Œ one guy 
came over to me, another guy, he says to me
 in Œ in Yiddish, he says, you don™t eat 
that, he says, that™s 
[in d ecipherable]
 only chew it on the mouth. I said, I never saw 
something like this in my 
life. And nobody said it, so there was other guys who got 
sick from it. I must Œ I don™t know how 
many packag es I ate up on the time. And 
then we Œ we were Œ we ge
t up a little bit and Œ and then
 more problems started in 
the camp.  

Q: Let me ask you, wh ich 
camp were you in when  you 
were liberated, and when 
was that? 
A: The camp I was liberated was 
Buchenwald
. I was, I th ink in 63
rd
 block, 63 Œ 30 
Œ something, I think that was the block, I was there. So Œ 
Q: When was liberatio n for you? 
A: I Œ it was in April some time, I think.
 I really don™t have the date. I have it 

marked down someplace, but in April some
times, it was the liber
ation. Then it Œ it 
arrived the problem was what happened  afte
r. We were all Œ of course, we didn™t 
eat for so long, and we were all hungry. A
nd what was the bi Œ th e biggest mistake,

what happen. They brou
ght in all the food the 
SS
 ha-had accumulated for 
themselves, and they brought it all in the 
camp, and we went th
ere, you know, like Œ 
like Œ like hungry people, and 
we start eating and then th
e problem Œ nobody told us 
don™t eat because the stomach is smaller. 
And we all sick, so we start eating and 
most of them died right in th
e sprot Œ in th e spot in front
 of me. I got a flat typhus, 
and I was too Œ took right away  to the 
hospital, and you know who treated me? A 
Nazi doctor, where he still had the 
SS
 sign on him, and he treated me 
[indecipherable]
. So th ey pumped the stomach and I had a headache after that for 
years and years I couldn™t get rid of that headache, that finally it went off Œ in 
account of that flat typhus. 
Q: In addition to  the typhus, did y
ou have any other me dical problems?  
A: Well, you know, you are so weak, and in
 general and you™re really the merak Œ 
you are Œ you are sick all over, I mean, it™s 
something which I could say, it™s Œ it™s a 
miracle thing which people surv
ived after that, because we all were by all miracle, 
you know, by all Œ how shall 
I say Œ medicine would not 
help us the way we were 
looking. No  Œ nothing would ha
ve help it, just miracle th
ing, and Œ and that™s what 
happened is the way we pulled through. Al
so , you pull through is the will Œ the will 
Œ the willpower to live, and that™s the wa
y it kept us going. We
 were a few people 
together there and we stick together til th
ings got a little bit better. And then doctors

came in. Al-All a prisoner of war doctor, all 
German Œ German doctors came in, in 
the Œ although we went to the hospital ther
e. We didn™t leave 
the camp for awhile, 
but later on we took 
[indecipherable]
 part of camps, an d we went in in the German 
and the 
SS
 barracks, and there start to get 
a little bit better in general. 
Q: When  you were taken to the hospital 
for treatment, you mentioned that you had 
an 
SS 
Œ a former 
SS
 doctor. Were there other doctors
 perhaps supervising, or Œ who 
Œ who was in charge of runnin
g the hospital at that point? 
A: That Œ that hospital actually was a hospital for the 
SS
 people. And due to the fact 
there was a lot of prisoner of war who we
re Germans, they ke
pt on running the 
same hospital, the same thing i-it was, ex
cept in Œ as Œ how shall I say? Instead 
treating the Germans, they treated us. 
The hospital was overflowed  and it kept on 
[indecipherable]
 mo re and mo re places and bringi
ng more and more doctors to try 
to see Œ to cure us a little better. And a
ll the medicine alrea
dy the Œ the American 
provided all this necessary 
thing for the people to surv
ive. Also, like I was mention 
before, the willpower to liv
e, we had a lot of encouragement from the American Œ 
for the soldier, from th e Jewi
sh soldiers, who told us 
Œ they were speaking, so 
interested. I wa Œ I had a eastern European
 accent, you know, and when they were 
talking, you know, I c Œ I couldn™t understa
nd. First I Œ I thought they Œ wh at kind 
of Yiddish they are talking to
 me? And then  I got used  to
 it and they told me, oh, I

was born in 
America
 already and my  grandparents 
came here, but it was interesting 
they were still speaking the Yiddish lang
uage, which it had a 
lot to do with our 
survival, I think. 
Q: What was it like for you to be free, 
no longer be a prisoner of the Germans? 
A: We were told in the camps that it doesn
™t matter. If y ou live, they gonna kill you, 
and if you die, you die. 
Q: Who™s the they? 
A: We were Œ we were talking between us
 in the camp. He says, there is no way 
out, because they not gonna let you live 
after Œ becausewe 
saw what happened 
already to the Œ the people who were weak, 
they took them to 
work and then they 
killed them. And we said between us, as
 long we could work, maybe they gonna 
keep us alive. Once we ca
nnot work, th-they not gonna let us go free, they gonna 
kill it. So actually to say Œ to find out in
 the end we are free, it just a Œ so many 
years passed and I still can™t believe it I™m fr
ee, I™m out of that thing. Because I still 
could see that it happen like yesterday. It
™s not Œ so many years, so many Œ 50 
years. I think it happened yesterday. I c
ould see everything in front of my  eyes, 
what happened, right now, what 
Œ anything, any Œ 
any little details.

Q: Were you a witness to any acts of retr
ibution or retaliation against the former 
prisoner Œ for Œ against the former guard s 
or against collaborators, by the prisoners 
or by the allies who came and liberated you? 
A: Well, that™s a ver Œ very interested. Fi
rst of all, when we got liberated, who Œ 
who was a little strong, they caught some of
 the guards. What they did to those 
guards, even me, I had such a hatred agains
t what they  did to me, I couldn™t stand it, 
I couldn™t see. They pulled 
their finger out. They took pl
iers and they pulled their 
finger out. The Œ they Œ they 
to ok a knife and they took th eir eyes out in front one of 
the other one. And when one got tired, a
nother guy took over. And Œ and wh at they 
did to those people, I™m sure they never 
[indecipherable]
. I couldn™t Œ I couldn™t 
witness something like this, some Œ because 
one human being to  do Œ to do to the 
other one, I Œ I Œ I said to the old guys ar
ound, I says the Œ I th
ink the lord sh ould 
take on th at, I saying we shouldn™t take 
any retaliation something like this. Even 

what they  did to us, you have to have a h
eart, you know, to do 
something like this. I 
also heard that soon the camp was surrendered, 
Buch wald  
was surrendered, they 
caught some guards and 
they put them to the wall Œ I do
n™t know, I di Œ I think it Œ I 
was told from the allied soldie
rs, I Œ I cannot Œ I Œ I can™t poi Œ point a figure which 
allied soldier Œ and they shot about a hun
dred, 150 people. They
 put them to the 
wall Œ first they show them th
e brutality that they did, 
and then theykilled them. I

think you™re better off to be 
killed than to Œ to 
do something like this, take eyes out, 
pull finger out or something like that. I Œ 
I couldn™t witness something like this, but 
they Œ th ey kept on doing it.
 Most of them was the f Œ 
French soldiers, they were 
imprisoned, they brought them in prison, 
you know, they  brough
t them to the camp, 
just a little bit before 
the liberation. They were really 
strong, and they did the job for 
this thing.  
Q: You mentioned that you were very we
ak , and Œ and you sa
id you only weighed 
60 or 65 pounds. Can you 
describe what you looked
 like at the moment of 
liberation? 

A: I have a Œ a Œ a picture here of one inma
te, the way he looked 
after the liberation, 
beyond medical Œ you know, beyond medica
l thing. If you would have given any 
kind of medicine, you could not surviv
e. And well, you were young, you know 

what, 20 years, 19 years old, you know, th
e willpower was there. You try to take 
care of yourself wherever you can, and Œ 
and now it-it™s something which you Œ you 
survived, which it Œ like I sa
id, it™s a miracle thing, 
whoever surviv ed, whoever 
came out alive from Œ from those camps.  

Q: You mentioned that you went to the 
hospital and you were cared for by the 
docto rs and they pumped your stomach. 
And you said you had a head ache for Œ for 

 
Interview with BernardPasternak  
 
October 22, 1997 
 

 
 
11
years after that. Did you have any other 
health  problems other than  the headache 
after your Œ your time in the hospital? 
A: Well, you know, even Œ even  you went
 to hell like this, a
nd when you are so 
young, you are in the teen
s you know, it™s Œ it™s some th
ing, you know, it doesn™t a-
affect that much, the thing 
wh ich it happened by the older 
people, which they Œ they 
died right on the spot. They Œ even the hospital, they di
ed. Of course, in the later 
age, it comes out a little bit. I have 
other problems now, wh
ich you know, it™s 
related to the camps, an-and even now du
ring the night a lot of time, I see the 
SS
 in 
Œ marching by, and Œ and I™ll 
wake up with  a sweat. I™ll go to  the window and I see, 
oh, I™m liberated. It™s just an unbelievabl
e thing, ev en now that I™m liberated. 
Q: After you got out of the hosp
ital, you said you went to the 
SS
, the barracks, and 
you were staying there for awhile. Tell me
 what were the living conditions like for 
you and the other people you 
were with at that time? 
A: The living condition wasn™t bad becau
se the American pr
ovided ever
ything. 
They  brought in everything. 
They brought it in with th e truckl Œ truckloads. But I 
was hoping that somebody will be there a
nd tell us, don™t touch th is, don™t touch 
this, because our stomach couldn™t take it 
and you just keep on throwing so much 
food in there and Œ matter of fact, I Œ the fi
rst thing wh at I did, there was a box of Œ 
of cookies, and I finished the whole box of
 cookies. I got sick from that too, and 

 
Interview with BernardPasternak  
 
October 22, 1997

then one 
SS
 guy says to me, who Œ one 
SS
 doctor says to me, you understand any 
English, American? I says no. The only 
one thing I heard the Americans saying, 
okay. That™s the only on Œ word  I could 
understand. He says, you know wh at you 
are eating? I says no. He says, you are ea
ting dog biscuits, and 
that™s why you are Œ 
got sick. I says, what about the Œ in the ca
mps, the Œ the meat tasted  so good. He 
says, that was dog meat what you are eati
ng, and that™s what you got sick. They  
have to put you back in the 
hospital for that da Œ so, matte
r of fact, I went in and out 
in the hospital for all kind 
of thing, any little thing. A
nd Œ and then they had a big 
celebration in the camp for liberation. And th
ey  had so mu ch fo od in there, and got 
sick again. You know, you ke
ep on eating and eating, you try to fu ll yourself up and 
Œ and that was the wrong thing to  do, bu
t nobody said, and we were too naïve to 
understand the whole thing, so Œ 

Q: When you were liberated, were wi Œ y
ou with any family or friends that you 
knew from before the war? 
A: I was Œ I had some people over there, some Œ just some friends, they were 
co min g  from th e sa me  to wn , th
e area, but I didn™t see them after this. The reason, 
on th e camp, and Œ in 
Buchen wald
 on the camp , and that s Œ it was some kind of a 
library, at Œ but the 
SS
 library. On that lib
rary walls, they put down  names Œ I don™t 
know who put on th e names, how they 
got the names, they put on names who

survive in  other camps. So I looked around 
there and I saw my te Œ my sister s i n  Œ 
in another camp not far from 
Suico
(ph). Now how do you get to 
Suico
(ph) from 
Buchen wald
, the one place, the other one? Then 
I find out that™s the bus is running 
from one town to  the other one, I had anot
her friend wh o finds somebody there, and 
I hop my self on the bus, but it wasn™t easy, the bus Œ th e bus was so fulled up 

inside, there was no room whatsoever. So we
 went on top of Œ on the bus, on the 
roof, and we laid down there. It was in Œ 
in July or August, it 
was Œ it was really so 
chilly, the weather was so 
chilly, was so cold, and we
 didn™t have the proper 
clothing, but we were in the Œ in top of 
the bus almo st all night, a day and a night 
something it took. What did we eat? Th
ere was some food around. Those people 
who were in the Œ in the Œ they were mo
stly of the Germans Œ German people, not 
any others, so they had some food, and they
 shared some of us until we arrived in 
the place and destination where we wanted to
 be. When we arrived in the place, I 
find there Œ I don™t rememb er the name
 of this town, but I know it was 
Suico
(ph), 
ou-outskirt of 
Suico
(ph). It™s 
Sachsen 
in 
Germany
. So when we arrived over there, 
I went to look up, I went to the 
Bürg ermeister
 and I wanted to find out if there is 
such a such people, where they  are, because they were a
ll registered. What they did 
there, they Œ also the American made the 
people to take in the refugees in Œ in 
civilian homes. So, due to the 
fact everybody was registered
 in town where they are, 

 
Interview with BernardPasternak  
 
October 22, 1997 
 

 
 
14
because they had to provide 
food for them. So he told me
 yes, there is Œ over there 
and there, there is three 
Pasternaks
. There was my oldest si ster 
Rose
, younger 
sister 
Raechel
(ph), and there was another sister, 
Gitel
. S o  I ask 
[indecipherable]
 
they said she died in the camp of Œ of-o
f typhus, something. So
 she died Hanukkah 
time, so Œ and then we were all together in  that time, and we were there for a little, 
short time. 

Q: Tell me about your reunion with your sister
s. What were the first things that you 
spoke about? 

A: When  we got the reunion, th e first thing 
was of Œ if Œ to find our father, because 
we know he was strong guy, and we know 
he could su rvive. We didn™t talk about 
our mo th er and another sister, because 
we know they went straight to the 
crematorium because my mother
 was sick, and with the little
 sister. That™s the first 
question, we tried to figure 
out a way. And then I had a
nother brother, and I wanted 
to find him. His no Œ his name was 
Azreal
(ph), so we wanted to find him, so we 
didn™t know wh ere to start looking. And we
 were in that camp a little while, and I 

wanted Œ and Œ and it was Œ it Œ it really 
was some kind of a barracks too, after Œ 
after Œ when we went out from the civilian,
 we went in a little barrack because we 
were ready to be Œ to  go back  into 
Germany
. It™s the reason it Œ because that time 
the allies, they made some
 agreement with the Russian s, that the 
Russians gonna 

 
Interview with BernardPasternak  
 
October 22, 1997 
 

 
 
15
come over to 
Suico
(ph) and they  gonna divide something 
[indecipherable]
 I heard 
something or Œ and Œ and th at means, the ne
xt day, we will be in Russian zone, not 
in the American zone. It was very interest 
at that time, w e didn™
t want to move from 
there because we wanted really to go strai
ght home to find out who 
else is aliv e, and 
who else we could get reunited. So  there wa
s again, soldiers, American soldiers. I Œ 
I don™t know their rank, and they say okay, 
let™s back up Œ in Yiddish, he say let™s 
back up and Œ and go. We going Œ we going in to 
Germany
, we going to 
Frankfurt
. I say why? I have it so good over
 here, for now. I™m gonna ma Œ we 
gonna make all the arrangement, and 
Œ and we gonna go
 back for my 
[indecipherable]
 which it was 
Transylvania
, 
Ma mu rish
(ph) and 
Oybarishu
(ph), 
he called it a different name 
[indecipherable]
 Yiddish  they called it 
Visho
(ph). So I 
wanted Œ so the Œ th e Œ the f Œ captain, wh at
ever he was, he had Œ he had some stars 
on th e time, was to be a captain. He sa
ys to me, you know, you people making a 
mistake. You ju st got liberated, and you 
gonna stay here. You know who™s Œ who™s 
gonna take you over? The Ru ssians. I say look,
 when  we were kids
, they told us the 
life in 
Russia
 is so good, he say, you only work
 and you get everything fo r nothing. 
So, you would have no
 pro Œ I me an, we wo uld have 
no problem, I says, nothing™s 
wrong with Œ with them Œ to stay over ther
e and to wait for them. He says, don™t tell 
me Œ don™t say it I didn™t tell you, I didn™t wa
rn you. He say goodbye. The next day,

the Russian came in and they Œ first of all,
 that ca Œ that barracks over there mu s Œ 
was only wo men. I think me and my  frie
nd was the only man, well a Œ maybe Œ I 
would say over a hundred girls 
[inaudible]
. Soon that guy come
s in and from us Œ 
there was people from 
Czechoslovakia
, there Œ Jewish people from there, an d they 
speak the language, the Russian language. 
The first thing the Ru
ssian came in they 
said, if you people don™t 
behave, we send you to 
Siberia
. That guy who told Œ 
talked to us about the Œ th-this way, he ha
d a co uple of spoon in
 his boots, dirty all 
around. I couldn™t figure out, I says to 
friends there, I says
, that™s the Russian? 
That™s what they told it to 
so good, and all the good thi
ng it™s in ther e? And he said, 
that™s the Russian. Now, we had to be ve
ry careful not to say anything because th-
they were drunk, right away
 they were drunk. I saw 
guys, they had two, three 
watches in th Œ in their hand, taking them
 from other people. So we Œ now we were 
Œ now we had a problem, tried to Œ we sh
ould get back  to the American zone, but 
we could not do it. So what we did, we
 made the arrangement, like I said before, 
and we went back to  
Romania
. It wasn™t such an easy trip  to go back. First of all, 
we had to  get out from 
Germany
, we went into  
Czechoslovakia
, to 
Prague
. We 
also went with the train. And this was 
all Russian controlled zone. Those people 
acted like wild animals, lik
e you see the wild kingdom of
 the animals. What di Œ 
what did they do? First of all, I saw right 
away that I am deali
ng with the devil. So,

I removed Œ I was in Œ on one 
car, one boxcar, I was with so
me girls, with the girls, 
like I was saying there was girls. So I says 
to my sister, first thing I gotta do, I gotta 
remove the locks. I took the 
locks off on bo
th side, they 
should not be 
able to come 
in. They  were banging all night to come in
 and to try and rob the people, rape the 
people, whatever they did. The next day afte
r the night, we Œ we got to a statio n, we 
got some water there. It was in 
Czechoslovakia
. What happened, I find out what 
the Russian dids. They were 
acting unhuman to those girl
, the skeletons girl, they 
were acting. They Œ even th
ey had something like a watc
h or something, they  took 
everything from them away. They
 were riding also on top 
of the Œ on that Œ on the 
train, and the bridges were low over there, 
most of them got killed on the spot there, 
because they were Œ they were drunk and st
anding up there, and they falled off. So 
from there, after I saw right 
away the situation again, so
 the girls come over to me, 
they say, you saved our lives. I was there w
ith my  other friend in  there, he says you 
saved our lives because you Œ smart thing 
to do is to remove
 the locks, they 
shouldn™t be able to come in. 
And then we arrived in Œ in 
Prague
, we were there a 
few days, it to Œ it took quite awhile
 to get for the train there to 
Prague
. And in 
Prague
 we were a few days. There was alrea
dy, I think the Jewish organizations; 
the first time I saw Jewish organizations tryto talk us and try to
 help us go further. 
Q: Which organizations?

A: The Œ the Joint. That time was the Joint. 
So they were a Œ also I saw Œ I was very 
surprise to see also people of th e Jewish organizations from 
South Africa
. Of 
course, I learned about 
South Africa
 
[indecipherable]
. There was a woman 
soldiers, Je wish girls, wome
n sold iers, speaking Yiddish 
in such a funny accent, I 
never Œ never heard something Œ I couldn™t
 figure out Œ even I understand, which I 
Œ I didn™t speak any English, I couldn™t 
understand the way they
 were talking. But 
m Œ the products Œ i-it™s too Œ it was the Joint, but most of the 
[indecipherable]
 it Œ 
it was written on the can, I Œ I Œ I™m a t
una, you know, a gift 
from the SouthAfrican 
Jews, 
Johannesburg
. I could see the label in Œ in
 front of my eye, there was 
written. And they made us very comforta
ble over there and they tried to get us 
further dow Œ further to Œ to get to
 our desin Œ destination. So  from 
Prague
 we took 
another train, of course. Some people Œ no
t with the same people
, some people, they 
went on different direction. We went into 
Budapest
. We sto Œ in 
Budapest
 I had 
very little problem, because Czech, I 
didn™t speak that language, but in 
Hungary
 I 
speak the language, so we didn™t have Œ 
we had very little problem. Also there was 
also the Jewish organization like the Join
t. I didn™t see the South Africans there, 
there was only the Joint, the American. 
And they took over a place, they call it 
Adjibat
(ph) school. There was a school there and the name was 
Adjibat
(ph) and 
they Œ there was a lot of food already,
 kitchens over there, setting up. But you

couldn™t go out on the street because th
ey were looking fo r Nazis, the Œ the 
Russians were looking for Nazis so they
 had the Hu ngarians with the Œ going 
around with them. And the Œ and they know 
right away, there™s not the Œ don™t look 
Hungarian because the way you walk, the way you eat, the way the thing, right 
away they  point it out from yo
u. So the Russians gave in
 the documents that we are 
re-refugees in 
Budapest
. We also got documents in 
Prague
, which I have them 
right here. And the reason I kept all thos
e documents from wherever I went, they 
gave us a paper and I kept
 it. I also got the pape
rs from the liberation from 

Buchen wald
 from the 
U.S. Army
, which I have it here in my possession. For all 
those year, I carried that. So in 
Buda pest
, I went out in the street, I felt like home, 
you know, we went out, we
 took a walk. I find one guy which e Œ he was our 
neighbor, and he was in the Czech army  
that time. And we walked, we kept on 
talking, we walk in the st
reet there and finallywe sa
w one guy Œ two Œ two people, 
not one, but one guy we recognized. I said, 
is it the chief of th
e police of our town? 
You know what this guy did w
ith him in my  Œ thi Œ th is person who I Œ I know from 
home? He Œ first he beat the hell out of 
him, and the Russians came around, th ere 
wa a lot of soldiers, they came around and they seen wh
at™s going on, they didn™t 
intervene at all, til the guy got ready, and th
en he s Œ he says to the Russian, he said, 
this is the guy, when  we were in the ghetto
 in the Œ and boxcars used to come in 

 
Interview with BernardPasternak

with potatoes or other kind of food for 
the ghetto, so this gu
y took away all the 
food, he gave it to the local people and 
to us, when it Œ in 
the bottom on the train 
there was dirt, he said, this is for the Jew.
 And then this fellow, the Jewish guy, he 
picked up the Œ the Czech sold
ier and he pu Œ picked up 
a lot of dirt from the floor 
and he fulled up his mouth, he says, this is
 the dirt what you to ld us to eat, now you 
eat the dirt. And after a few days, we deci
ded we are going to see whoever™s alive. 
It™s about five an Œ 500 kilometer from 
Budapest
 to our destination. When we got Œ 
it was easy to get, you know, th
e Œ the traveling that I Œ the trains used to go maybe 
20 miles an hour, the whole train, even th
e Œ it was written in 
the car they go 40 
mile, they only go about 20 
mile. Sometime you could run fa
ster than the trains, the 
way they  had those trains. And we got ho
me to our destin Œ destination, the 
Oybarishu
(ph) 
Mamu rish
(ph). We came home, and of course the Œ it was a very 
interesting place. First of all, on the da
 Œ this place, before th-they call it 
Rishu
(ph), 
it was 
Austria-Hungary
 before the first World War. 
On the fir Œ on the W-World 
War first after, they Œ the Ro manian took
 it over. In 1940, 
the Hu ngarians took it 
over. So we were shoved to
 one Œ from one to the othe
r one. When the Hungarians 
went Œ when  it was 
Austro-Hungary
, that wasn™t a bad place to live, and to Œ it 
was pretty good over there, because ther
e was a lot of wood, and the Hungarian s, 
the Austrian didn™t have so mu ch wood, th e tree, so it was not a bad life. But when  

 
Interview with BernardPasternak

21
the Romanian came in, and the Romanian hada lot of wood, so life got deteriorated, 
it was Œ it was such a good, 
I mean, people were suffe
ring a lot. And when  we 
arrived in the Œ on th e Œ in the town and th e city, manufactured was 
[indecipherable]
 city with Œ of three Œ 4,000 Je
ws in there before the war. When 
we arrived there, we find a couple of Jewi
sh families in there 
and we tried to see 
how we could do so mething, a
nd tried to build up our lives
 Œ put together the life. 
But we really couldn™t make it out. We tr
y all kinds of business, we™re trying to 
bring in store from one Œ from one place to  the other one, tra Œ traveling to th e 
towns, things like this, and the bot
tom line, we couldn™t make out. 
Q: When you came back to
 your town, how were you 
received by your Œ your 
neighbors, the non-Jewish community? 

A: We Œ we really Œ it wasn™t too bad ev
en before we le Œ we got along with the 
Romanians pretty good. It 
was a city from Romanians, 
Hungarians, Germans. We 
had our own, you know, lik
e neighborhoods. This was a German neighborhood, 
there was Hungarian. But really i-it wasn
™t that bad before the war with those 
people, we got along pretty good. But th-t
he Œ the thing is, w
ith the Germans it was 
another Œ another ball game that time b
ecause they Œ they went Œ they called it 
[indecipherable]
 they all went to the German
 army, they all went to the 
SS
 army. 
And of co urse, that was not, you know, go
od cooperation with th
em. So when I was 

 
Interview with BernardPasternak  
 
October 22, 1997 
 

 
 
22
Œ we Œ when  we were in 
Viseu
, so our first thing, we find our brother in there. He 
was in the Hungarian army as a laborist. 
And we find him over there already, but 
we couldn™t make ends meet over there.
 So I was there with my Œ my brother 
Azreal
(ph), and I was there with my sister 
Rose
 and 
Raechel
(ph) and 
Gitel
. But the 
most interested thi
ng, my  sister was married before
 the war, and my  brother-in-law 
came back and they go
t reunited again in 
Viseu
 in the same town
. So  Œ but there 
was no more futures because I saw  a different
 type of life after, whenever you travel 
one city to the other one, a
nd the life in Œ in the town 
was so backwards. So there 
was really nothing more we could do. So  
we made preparation. We tried to sell 
thing, but to who you gonna 
sell? Because when we came 
home, mo st of the houses 
was robbed. They took everyt hing away, the local people
. Even we got along with 

them nice, but they  still, you know, they s
till tried to get something for nothing and 
they came down Œ they used 
to live out of town, they ca
me down in the town, they 
occupied all the Jewish houses in there,
 and it was no life whatsoev er. So our mind 
was just to get out of there, and 
to see what we could start up new. 
Q: You mentioned several reunions; your
 reunion with your sisters, and then  
meeting your brother and th en your sist
er finding her husband. Wh en  you became 
reunited, did you sit down with these fa
mily members and exchange experiences? 
Tell them what happened to 
you and hear their story?

A: We Œ we ex Œ first of all, we were ta
lking about the Œ our father to see if we 
could find him to find out what
 it is. And that was in the 
top of the agenda, to find 
out if he™s alive, because we know he 
Œ he could surv ive because he was strong 
fellow and so the thing is th
is, we find some other people
 who came in in town , and 
they told us we should 
not expect the father, because he had Œ he was in 
Theresienstadt
 for specialty reason and they  bombed the camp , and he was 
work ing there as a veteran docto r with a frie
nd of his, and he di
dn™t go to work  that 
day, he was taking care of the German hor
ses, and the allies bombed the camp, and 
destroyed the camp, and they kille
d them, the f-f Œ the first day of 
Chol HaMo ed 
Pesach, and that™s when we keep the 
Ya hrzei t  
because we know ex actly when  he 
got killed.

Theresienstadt
.  

 
Interview with BernardPasternak

A: Well, there Œ some more people came 
in in our town, and 
the city, they came 
home and we tried to find out if the Œ if 
Œ if maybe they coul
d find out where my  
father was. We didn™t know he was in 
Theresienstadt
, we had Œ couldn™t find out 
what camp. Then there was a barber, he was a 
avrum
(p h) 
de
 
barbera
(ph) they 
called in town. He was a very 
good friend my father, and th
en he told us the tragedy 
what happened. My father kn
ows horses, and he had a friend, he was working in  a 
drugstore, and due to the fact there was 
a very good co mb ination, and the Germans 
give him the job taking care of their horses. 
And th en the next day or so, that time it 
was very big bomb ardment, they wiped ou
t the camp, right, and my father and his 
friend 
Drogas
(ph), th-they both got killed. And it was the first day of 
Chol 
HaMoed
 
Pesach
, and that™s the day we are keeping th e 
Yahrzeit
, b ecause we 
know exactly wh at the day and Œ and th e 
Ya hrze it
 for my mother, 
my sister , we 
keep the first day of wh en we arrived in 
Auschwitz
, that was 
[indecipherable]
. 
And we Œ it™s actually picked 
a day, because we don™t know
 exactly when they went 
to the crematorium, but according to the rabbi
, they told us that
 when you arrived, 
that™s the day that you gotta keep  the 
Ya hrzei t
. But therein Œ then , after we find out 
about our father, so there were no more hope
 in there, and no more thing, so try to 
go back from where we came, to 
Germany
, to the American zone, we know we 
have family in the 
United States
 and other family in other areas. So we tried to go 

 
Interview with BernardPasternak

25
back because we already h
eard that they have there 
DP
 camp s they opened in  
Austria
 and 
Germany
 and other places. So we go in
 in that camp and from there 
probably we™ll be able to go
 into our Œ another country 
because we have nothing to 
do any more in here, it™s all washed out.
 No w, going back wasn™t so easy, it was 
very hard to  go back . First of all, we 
had to  have money to travel, you couldn™t do 
it. We had a few things, but we hardly got a
nything for it. So we start traveling, we 
went back to one city, they call it 
[indecipherable]
. We went over there with the 
train. From there we had 
to go in on 
the Œ to the 
Czechoslovakia
 side again, in the 
Allneek
(ph)
 Javorkt
(ph) mountains. We went Œ they  shouldn™t catch us, the 
Russian, because if they catch you, they were 
controlled with Russian, 
[indecipherable]
 Ru ssian they get you, th en like 
they said, they take you to  
Siberia
(ph). So we went to 
Czechoslovakia
. From there we had to cut into 
Hungary
, also during the day Œ it was summer 
Œ during the day we were sitting on 
the high grasses, lay down over there, be
cause there was a lot of Russian patrols, 
and a lot of them got caught. And then
 we went, little by little, til we arrived to 
Hungary
. We went over to 
Hungary
, back to 
Hungary
, and when we arrived 
there, also we Œ they caugh
t us, because a lot of people, they were talking, and 
you™re not supposed  to talk. And they Œ 
that time was the corn harvest, we were 
sitting in there, and at night we start r
unning again. We Œ we 
went one place, we 

 
Interview with BernardPasternak

26
had a few dollars that time, we sold some
thing. And th ere was a guy who used to  
take over from Œ who to ok over the wa
ter there with the boats, something 
[indecipherable]
 from one place to the other one, 
so we gave him a few dollar, he 
took us over in the other side, on the Hu ng
arian side. And then we took a train over 
there. The train which Œ the train will go to 
Budapest
. Now also that train was so 
full of people, local people, there was no pl
ace what to put noth
ing. We also find 
out that 
Hun g a r y
 has no salt. There™s no salt over th
ere. So we took a few bags of 
salt, and we Œ to take it back to 
Hungary
, because that was a big commodity over 
there. Oh, actually, the salt we had for 
nothing, because Romanian had so mu ch 
salt, which it was no problem. When we took 
the train, we also had to go on the 
slate roof. We had to  go on the slate roof 
and lay down there, you know, to keep on 
going, which it took a fe
w days from one area til we are Œ til we got to 
Buda pest
. 
Now who was there? It was there was my brother 
Area l
(ph) and again my  older 
sister with her husband, th
ey remained behind
. They Œ they deci
ded they not ready 
to go back  yet. So it was my  other two si
ster, my  brother and my self. So we stood 
on that slate roof over there, also the br
idge, it was so low you had to  keep  your 
head down. And a lot of time, you know, th
e way those trains were going, it™s not 
like a train, you know, it was shaking you 
back and forth and throwing you around. 
Then finally we arrived in a Œ in 
Budapest
. And from there, there Œ there was 

 
Interview with BernardPasternak  
 
October 22, 1997 
 

 
 
27
already Œ the Joint was there, and put us 
up there temporary places. We also had to 
give for th e Hungarian newspaper, we ha
d to give interviews to them what 
happened . And we stood th ere about a we
ek  or so, and then Œ the be Œ the 
Bricha
, 
the Jewish orga Œ the Jewish 
Bricha
 from Œ from that time of 
Palestine
. So what 
the Jewish 
Bricha
 from 
Palestine
, working already to try to help  people from 
destination, one the other one. So  the bi Œ 
Bricha
 brought us over to
 our destination 
close to the Austrian border. 
I forgot to tell the name of 
the Œ of the city over there. 
And from there, the 
Bricha
, they wanted we Œ we should 
go Œ we should go further. 
Th-The destination supposed  to be 
Pa-P alestine
 that time. So, when we arrived in 
Saulfil
(ph), 
Soulfil
(ph) Œ something Œ so when  we a
rrived over there in that place, 
of course we had to cross over to 
Austria
. No w, how do you cross to 
Austria
, 
because it was all Russians, a
ll around. Andthen 
what the border wa
s, it™s so tight, I 
mean with soldier, that he couldn™t go th
rough at all over ther
e, even through the 
fields, and more than it was in 
Hungary
 and 
Romania
 and 
Czechoslovakia
. So w-
we sold a few things, a few Œ first of all, 
we sold the salt that 
we already had, about 
50 dollar that time for the salt, it w as su
ch a commodity. Must have schlepped 
maybe 200 kilo of salt, between all of us. 
We had about 50 dollar already. Well, we 
arrived over there in this 
place, so they told  us, the only way you could go past 
there, if you have to go, th
ey have to take you over th e border. We find out there is 

 
Interview with BernardPasternak

28
a guy, a Russian guy, a driver, he
 had a truck there, his name was 
Sashka
(ph). We 
talked to him Œ I mean , I didn™t talk, becau
se I didn™t speak Ru
ssian. So there was 
people who talked to him, and finally he ag
reed I think five dollars for each of us. 
We wanted to give him shillings, Hungarian 
money, but we Œ beca
use that was easy 
to get. He says no, he says, 
nyeda
(ph) shilling, 
nyeda
(ph) Œ 
dollare
(ph), 
dollare
(ph). So finally we give him five dolla
r each, still had a few dollar left, and 
he fulled up the truck, a open truck. He sa
ys, all Œ everybody lay 
down in  the truck. 
We come to the border andthe Austrians, they try to 
stop us with some soldier 
guard . Yo u know what the guy did? He went
 right over them. He kept on going like 
Œ like nothing, he didn™t care who stopped 
him or what, because there was Œ to him 
was no border. And Œ and he to
ok us in to Œ we passed 
Wiener Neustadt
, and we 
arrived in Œ in Œ in 
Vienna
. In 
Vien na
. We arrived in 
Vienna
, that was the 
destination. 
Q: When ? 
A: The time Œ the time from one to the other 
only took weeks, weeks,
 to get to this 
destination. I would say it was summer, 
and really it could be in September 
sometime, August, September, because we 
didn™t stay too long, we got liberated 
May, and August, September, maybe Octo ber, 
we arrived in th Œ in there. From 
there Œ when we arrived to 
Vien na
, we already had so me he
lping, people help ed us

and they told it, there is the 
Rothschild
 hospital, which they used that hospital Who 
are they? They
 Œ the Œ the 
Bricha
 from Œ from 
Palestine
, they used that hospital. Of 
course, who paid? The Joint pa
id. The American Jew paid 
for that. So we used the 
hospital for all the refu gees who got together. Now, 
Vienna
 you couldn™t get out 
just like this, because 
Vienna
 Œ 
Vienna
 had the four zone over there. And we were 
on th e American zone. Now how you gonn
a get Œ you couldn™t even go from one 
zone to th e other one. Now 
how you gonna go in, and a
ll Œ everybody wanted to go 
to the American zone because that was 
the right place to go if you wanted to  
emigrate, o r even they had 
the French zone, th e Englis
h zone, they  didn™t count 
munch Œ mu ch in th at, they 
didn™t care too mu ch about the other zone. So it was 
very interested when you are in
 the Œ in the hospital, in the 
Rothschild
 hospital, 
they Œ the Join
t, with the 
Bricha
 together, they Œ their leader
s, they rented a truck, a 
big truck and th ey made it special for Œ for Œ 
for people to be able
 to sit down in the 
Œ in the side of the truc
k. And we should go from 
Vienna
, we should go to 
Linz
. 
Linz
 is in 
Austria
. Of course 
Linz
 was already the American zone. There was a 
bridge over there, and th
at divided between the Russian and th e American zone. 
When  we got to Œ when  we got f Œ we Œ we
 got on th e way, you know, we Œ so what 
happened  in  the mo untain, the truck had an
 accident, banged with  another truck. I 

hit so bad my  arm there, and ripped off th
e r Œ the roof, everything, and we couldn™t

go fu rther. So then  we have to take a train.
 S o  we come with th e train, they fulled 
up th e train with so many people from the 
camp s, ma Œ from other camp s together 

[indecipherable] 
of three, because everybody want
 to run away. And we got with 
the train, we got by the border by 
Linz
, the Russians. We were told Œ they ask you 
who you are Œ first of all, you don™t speak 
no Ru ssian, a word, ev en the people who 
speak Russians, they sh ouldn™t say a word in Russian. So
 they told us 
we should say 
we are Greeks. We were displaced, thr-thrown out from 
Greece
, and now we like to 
go back. The train stopped there by th e Œ by th
e bridge there, where it™s supposed to 
go over to the American zone
, on the Ru ssian zone, the train stopped there, and the 
Russkis 
came around. They were a 
little bit better dressed alr
eady, they didn™t have 
that knife and fork and Œ and sticked in 
in their boots. They were a little cleaner, 
they come around th is, and 
to every car they say, 
[speaks Russian]
 that Œ that much 
I learned. And nobody Œ ev erybody lo oked  
in them, and we kept on saying Œ a guy 
came over to me, he says to me 
[Russian]
? No, 
Greco
, 
Greco
, 
Greco
. So he kept 
on going, because that™s what 
they told. But in th
at train with me, there was a lot of 
Russian Œ I know what they 
were looking, they were lo
oking fo r deserters, mo stly 
deserters. T h ere was a russ Œ a lot of Russian
 Jewish soldier, they deserted and they 
went to 
Palestine
. I would say mo st of the credit fo
r the liberation, 1948, comes to 
those Russian soldier, th
ey were already trained, and th
ey  really know how to fight,

those people, that™s why Œ I was talking with
 them after. So fina
lly th ey Œ we went 
to that bridge and we went into  
Linz
 already in the American zone. It was the Œ it 
was something to us like in
 the liberation from the Nazis, because we really 
liberated now. We stood in 
Linz
, they had camp s there made up for displace 
persons. So I was talk with my sisters, my
 brother, I says to the Œ I says, you know, 
this is too close to the Russian. I Œ I Œ we 
hated them so mu ch wh at they did to us. I 
said, let™s go further and far away fro
m them, far away. So
 we went into 
Sa lzburg  Œ  
Salzburg
, and they  also had camp set up, a displaced person camp .  
Q: In the 
DP
 camp in 
Salzburg
, who or which agencies 
provided assistance fo r 
you? 
A: That time the Œ the Joint was providing with a lot of stuff, but that time was the 
UNRRA
. The Œ the organization which they Œ 
they Œ they  did a terrific job, no 
question about it. Later on, it took over from the 
UNRRA
, took over the 
IRO
, 
International Refugee Organiza
tion. So  they to ok over, bu
t we were much better off 
in the 
UNRRA
 when we arrived in Œ in 
Salzburg
. I had some mechanical and 
electrician background. On the fi
rst thing I became the chief of 
[indecipherable] 
and I have here a statement from the lage
r camp, and it™s written in Yiddish, and 
I™m gonna read it for y
ou Yiddish. It says 
[reads in Yiddish]
 So what it says in 
English, that I was in Œ in Œ in 
DP
 camp there, I became the chief electrician on the 

 
Interview with BernardPasternak

32
Œ on the camp, and there was a lot of people, thousands of people, and th ey all 
counted to me and I did the best I can to
 make everybody comfortable, and Œ and 
then that™s why they give
 me this Œ this thing. 
Q: Can you translate th at for me? 

A: In the Œ in the Œ in the 
English way, right? Okay . That
™s where we were Œ we are 
a Œ we are telling that 
P a sterna k [indeciphera b le]
, he Œ he Œ he was born in  1927, 
and he lived in the Œ in 
Salzburg
, the camp in 
Sa lzburg
 they called 
Machne 
Yehuda
, 
estra
(ph). He was the electrician in la 
Œ in the camp, and he did a lot of 
installation work , he made a lot of people very comfortable. People start to come  

that time, the people 
who got liberated from
 Russia
 Œ th ere wasn™t only 
concen tration Œ people from the concen tra
tion camp, there was already people they 
came from 
Russia
. And I Œ I tried to do th e best 
and Œ and of course there was no 
pay whatsoever for this, you did it just fo
r the Œ for the sake of the people. And 
that™s Œ it™s Œ it™s Œ it™s a signed by the 
[indecipherable]
 and it™s signed by the Œ by 
the whole Œ by the whole people in there who 
was in charge of that camp. But when 
I was in camp there, I did not really Œ I was 
not such a great electr
ician to be able to 

get a job any other place, you know. There, 
you put a wire right to left, and so you 
can be an Œ you could get by. 
But I was very interested in
 the Œ in that kind of job 
for my future, so I Œ I went and I re
gistered myself in Œ in I Œ in the 
ORT
 school. 

 
Interview with BernardPasternak

33
They  had a 
ORT
 school, and I Œ I learned there Œ 
I went there electrician school, 
but I had a problem, yeah, I had a problem at the 
ORT
 school. On e of the problem 
Œ most of them were speaking Polis
h, were mostly fr Œ they came from 
Russia
. I 
didn™t speak a word Polish, 
a few word s, so I had a problem, but the problem got 
solved a little bit, I start pi
cking up the Polish language, so
 it got a little bit better. I 
had certificate right in front of my eyes with a picture from the 
ORT 
in 
Salzburg
. It 
says 
[indecipherable]
 student of electric, electrician in 
Salzburg
, and this was 
given out to me in 1948. I also have one Œ another one that™s Œ th-that 

[indecipherable]
 from the 
IRO
 Œ well, from the 
ORT
, was in Œ in 
Haline

says, Asse mbly Center
 Haline

International Refu gee Organization area, team 
one, 
Salzburg
, 
Austria
, 
Haline
(ph)
 
12 April 1949, that™s wh
en  they give that out. 
And this is the certifica Œ the certif Œ certify that 
Pasternak Beru
 Œ I didn™t even 
know I used to call 
Bernard Beru
, now I didn™t even know 
this, they call me that 
Beru
, 
b-e-r-u
, born in 15/8/1927, in 
Oybarishu
, 
Ro mania
 has been registered in 
Camp 
Reidenburg
 since August 1946 til August 1948.
 So you had to have all this 
thing if you wanted to emigrate to  anothe
r country , you had to be registered in all 

those places. So Œ 
Q: In addition to  the people who were sp
eaking Po lish, so you pick ed up some 
Polish language, who else was in the 
DP
 camp with you? 

 
Interview with BernardPasternak  
 
October 22, 1997 
 

 
 
34
A: Mostly Jewish. Mostly Œ mostly Œ most  of them Jewish people. That camp was 
in 
Salzburg
, in 
Reiden burg
 what they called the camp, 
that was mostly all Jewish 
people. It was, like I said, there was pe
ople from concentration camp, there was 
people who arrive from 
Russia
, and destination was 
Israel
, because we supposed to 
get that Œ you know, the Œ the country  is 
supposed  to be born that time. Before Œ 
before even the country was born, I had a little bit, you know
, like something, a 
revenge type Œ I felt myself I 
need some kind of revenge to
 see what they did to the 
Jewish people, to the familie
s, things like that. And the 
only thing what I could do 
to go in and to Œ to go to the 
Irgun
, they had classes in Œ 
in the camp they had 
classe s for t h e 
Irgun
. So I became a 
Irgunist
. I did a few things, you know, right or 
wrong, whatever it was, so to take some 
kind of revenge, to s
ee Œ and I learned to 
shoot very good, and I became
 to Œ to be a very good 
sold ier in there. It took 

months and months. Of course, it was 
hidden, it was underground whole Œ th e 
whole thing. There was some already Israelis 
[indecipherable]
. Matter of fact, most 
of them were Israelis who trained us how
 to shoot. And I never had a gun in  my  
hand or th ing like th is. So they  had, in 
Salzburg
, they  had big parks in there, in Œ 
like amusement parks. I went in the park
 one time with my  friends, and you know, 
they had this Œ to shoot the ducks or 
the other thing, and I aimed perfect and 
everything, whatever I want to shoot, so I be
came Œ matter of fact
, they even said, i-

 
Interview with BernardPasternak

35
if you go Œ when  I go to 
Israel
, is gonna be, I™m gonna be 
the first sergeant without 
any st-st Œ star from th e stripe, not from th
e beginning. They put me on fo r sergeant 
right away , the way I was leading, and th
e way I was operating 
and Œ and the way I 
was learning the whole thing. I wanted to go to  
Israel
 so bad because before the 
war, and I was a kid, I also
 belonged to organization 
Betar
. I wanted to go to 
Israel
 
that time, b u t I could not go at that time be
cause the parents were ver Œ very ag ainst, 
and also the rabbis were very against, a
nd even that time, of which the Romanians 
didn™t care too mu ch  about the organization,
 we had to  be underground in account 
of the Jew, our own Jewish people, because 
they said to me, if 
you step out of this 
city from here, you™re gonna became a non-Jew.
 So I says, well, there is Œ my  aunt 
is in the 
United States
 and she™s Jewish, and maybe
 I could go th ere. No, you 
cannot go no place, otherwise you™re not gon
na be a Jew, you™re gonna throw aw ay 
your heritage, your Jewish heritage. And th
ey Œ matter of fact, really I wanted to go 
to 
Israel
 because my Œ my Œ I Œ the Zionists we
re so much Œ even
 now, my Zionist 
was so much in me, I wa
nted to go just to 
Israel
. I didn™t care, I wanted to be 
[indecipherable]
 just to go, and I was young, 17 
- 18 year. I coul
d not go because 
those rabbi didn™t let me. And I tell you the 
truth, I have a hatred for that, because 
they hold us back, all the ki
ds. Most of the kids they ev
en Œ they even
 got killed in 
the concentration camp. So when
 I was already ready to go to 
Israel
, which I 

 
Interview with BernardPasternak  
 
October 22, 1997 
 

 
 
36
mentioned, I had an aunt, she lived in the 
Bronx
, and Œ 156 
Honeywell 
Avenue, 
and was 
[indecipherable]
 Boulevard, so 
Southern
 Boulevard. So I went and we 
didn™t know her address, but my  older sister 
Rose
, she remembered  she used to 
write to Œ my mother used 
to write to her sister. Sh
e rememb ered the address by 
heart. So we wrote her, and she said, dear, 
we are so happy you ar
e alive, and things 
like this. She said, don™t try to 
go any other place, come to the 
United States 
first. I 
have Œ matter of fact, I have
 papers here in front of me
. When my aunt send us all 
paper, you know, the affidavits
 with working, with all th
e guarantee. She says, first 
come here and then
 you gonna go to 
Israel
, 
Israel
 just created right now, it™s gonna 
be a little h ardship. I says, I don™t care the 
hardship, that™s what I want to do. And 
finally I couldn™t leave my sister, we Œ 
we have such a few left, so finally we 
decided we come to 
United States
. 
Q: Who in your family was with you in the 
DP
 camp? 
A: We were al Œ my si sters, all si
ster, my brother, we were all in the 
prekee
 ca Œ 
DP
 camp in 
Salzburg
, except my older sister with he
r husband, they remain behind. 
Q: Can you be a little b it more specific a
bout the kind of Œ of activities you engaged 
in wh en you were 
training for the 
Irgun
? You said there was some retaliation. Can 
you please just cl
arify a little bit? 

 
Interview with BernardPasternak  
 
October 22, 1997 
 

 
 
37
A: Yes, well, we had the Au strians there and Œ and in the 
Reidenburg
 camp, there 
was a fire b rigade in there. I went out 
with my  friend and we blew  up a truck over 
there, we put something in there, we bl
ew up the truck. There was no human life 
lost. And it was another time we 
went to Œ to a bridge there, we know th at a lot of 
Germans are passing over there, we blew up the bridge over there, so we really got 
a little revenge in a different way.
 But I still wanted to go to 
Israel
 with that time, 
like with the training thing I had and I was very, very famous 
[indecipherable]
 
guys there. But I feel very bad my aunt took 
th Œ talked us into co
me to this country, 
which Œ and then, you know, once you came 
in this country, so you don™t go away  
so easy, so Œ I cha Œ also want to mention, my  brother, 
Azreal
(ph), he had so mu ch 
courag e, wh ich I, tell you the truth, I woul
dn™t do it. What did he do? He went back 
to 
Ro ma nia
 in the town, he got my
 sister and my  brother-i
n-law and brought them 
back to 
Austria
. We alre Œ I already had so me m
oney in there in the camp because I 
was doing so me work sa Œ for the Austri
ans, I was doing some work outside the 

camp. They needed electricians, so I went
, my friends and we did some work. The 
Austrians, the work what we did, it was not  really for the Aust
rians, it was for the 
American soldiers, they were living in 
Austria
 in the houses, in 
the apartment, and 
they needed some lights and all those thing,
 and we used to put th em on, I used to 
get the stove, you know, all the merchandi
se, whatever I need
. And I used to do 

 
Interview with BernardPasternak  
 
October 22, 1997 
 

 
 
38
some work from them
, so I already had some mone
y. And we give this whole 
whatever we had to my brother, and he star
t the journey back and he got them back 
safe to 
Austria
, I mean, to 
Salzburg
, I says Œ I don™t kno
w whoever could do 
something like this, but he had th e guts and he
 did it. So til Œ we all got togeth er, we 
all were, th e whole family got together in 
Austria
. 
Q: When you were in the 
DP
 camp , wh at kinds of things did the surv ivors talk 
about, other than perhaps the Œ the traini
ng that you were havi
ng, and Œ and your Œ 
your ideas about going to 
Israel
, what else did you talk about? 
A: Well, it f Œ we f Œ first of all, w e 
talked about families, what happened. And 
when we went in in Œ in 
the concen tration camp , we di
dn™t know what happened, 
we didn™t know what™s going 
on, anyhow, til we were in 
there. So everybody used 
to tell the story, I was ther
e, I was there, and one guy says, oh I was there too. I 
says, I was in the same  block and I couldn™t
 rec Œ I didn™t even know he was there. 

And the main 
[indecipherable]
 the whole thing you want
 to know is all just 
Israel
, 
just 
Israel
, to get the land of 
Israel
, to get to our own place. 
Also, at the first time, 
and it was a holiday, it was Passover at that 
time, and there was the Austrian station, 
the 
[indecipherable]
 radio station, and the first time
 we heard Yiddish speaking on 
the Austrian radio station to  wish us ha
ppy, healthy holiday. And it was one of the 

 
Interview with BernardPasternak  
 
October 22, 1997 
 

 
 
39
greatest things to Œ to hear
 a Jewish voice f-from, you 
know especially in Œ in 
Austrian, Na-Nazi land, and Œ yeah.  
Q: When you were in the 
DP
 camp, were there any demonstrations for the partition 
of 
Palestine 
and Œ an d the state of 
Israel
? 
A: No. I Œ I don™t think there was any de
mo nstration, because he ha Œ you didn™t 
have 
[indecipherable]
 to demonstrate whatsoe Œ we 
did have different type of 
demonstration. We had demonstr
ation, there used to be a lot of guys, they used to 
go out on 
Salzburg
, they used to beat up guys, Ge
rman guys, Au strian guy, they  
used to beat them up. They  used  to be 
caught by the police, a
nd the police arrested 
them, and we couldn™t see 
this Œ a German sol Œ German people to hold our own 
people, so we start to demonstrating, we didn™t want to eat that time, you know, we 

took the food out the middle of the camp,
 and we took the Œ there was a kitchen 

there, I mean, there was a lo
t of food, and Œ and we spille
d the food on the street 
over there, and we showed 
the camp  comma nder Œ he was an American Œ that we 
not gonna tolerate something 
like this. So they finally 
have the agreement that we 
gonna hold them in our own ja
ils to find out what Œ so  we  brought them back to the 
camp and matter of fact, the guy™s name was 
Kulnik
(ph), so he brought him back in 
the camp, and Œ til the trial came and th ey
 had trial about it a
nd they find him not 
guilty. But they also give hi
m the punishment Œ the judge 
in there give him the first 

 
Interview with BernardPasternak  
 
October 22, 1997 
 

 
 
40
punishment, he said, you have to  leave th
e country  right away. And there was no Œ 
you know, there was no com Œ transportatio
n to go anyplace, so there was special 
transportation fo r some of those g
uys, they  took th em straight to 
Palestine
. Final Œ 
final Œ probably they  wind up in  
Œ 
in 
Cyprus
 that time. B u t that was the 
punishment. So Œ 
Q: When you did your retri
bution activities, the blowing 
up of the truck, whatever, 
did you make it known that it was a Œ a Je
wish activity in retribution for what 
happened during the war? 

A: Yes, because we put Œ we le
ft our Œ our Œ our Œ w-we put a 
[indecipherable]
. 
That™s wh at it™s gonna be, so they know
 right away that it comes from us. But 
nobody would expect me whatsoever, I 
was such a quiet guy in camp , fixing 
everything in there. And th en we went out,
 had a few guys, they really were tough. 

Like, I was mentioning these Ru-Russian so
ldiers Œ the Jewish 
soldiers, and they 
were really trained, they were really some 
[indecipherable]
 what they say, they 
really did. And they  did so
me contribution to the Œ to 
Palestine
 that time. They 
were good. 

Q: You said that you left like 
a calling card. What was it? Rock, 
kach
? 

 
Interview with BernardPasternak

41
A: 
[indecipherable]
 that™s what it™s ga Œ that™s 
the way it™s gonna be. The way you 
say Œ way they say never again, this was 
[indecipherable]
 you know something, 
that™s the way it™s gotta be. And Œ 
Q: Only like this. 
A: And only like this and th ey know right aw
ay that Œ matter of fact, they gave us a 

name, the German; 
[indeciphera ble] 
was here. They Œ the 
way they p Œ they 
pronounced it. So Œ actually we Œ we Œ we 
just took our little reve
nge and Œ and Œ to 
show them that we are not sleeping people, we are not people you could shove us 

around, an d we could do something too.
 Thing like that. An
d they  Œ the Œ the 
Germans, they Œ I would say they  start resp
ecting us in general. We also did Œ we 
also traveled to 
Germany
 itself, to 
Minchen
(ph) where there was a Œ so many 
Jewish people in there, so we had co-cont
act, along with the ot
her one, and we got 
caught by the border too, by 
the American soldiers, we got caught, because it™s still 
a country, going to  the other one. And we
 got caught by the border, he™s Œ we Œ we 
supposed to go that time to Œ to 
Minchen
(ph) from 
Salzburg
. So when  we got by 
the border, so two 
MPs 
come over, they say halt. Stay there, he says. Where are you 
going? I say, we gonna go to 
Salzburg
. It™s not true, because we came from 
Salzburg
. He said, you can™t go
, you have to go to 
Minchen
(ph). And that™s the 
way we went right thro ugh. So , we had to  
laugh in our own way,
 you know. But we 

 
Interview with BernardPasternak

42
did got caught a few mo re times
 and Œ and Œ in that Œ in 
that thing, by th e border 
thing. It was guarded by the allies, you 
know, and couldn™t f
ool around too much, 
so Œ but we were young, you know, and fu
ll of hate, hate from the Œ wh at they did 
to us, you know, and Œ and ma
tter of fact, I saw, when I was a kid, and when the 
Hungarian soldier marched by in  the 40 
Œ in the 40s, and 
they stopped Œ the 
soldiers, they Œ they  stopped the regiment ov
er there, right in front of the shul, and 
one of the Hungarian officer, he says to tw
o, three guys, he says, there™s a lot of 
Jews there, I want you to pull their ber Œ 
beard out and hit them
. You know, so they 
pulled the beard, they hit them, they kept 
on going. And th is, you know, this Œ th is 
thing kept telling me, eating and eating in
side, why, why, why? Because why are 
they doing that, because I have another 
religion? There™s so many religions, well 
why pick my religion? So it™s Œ it™s Œ it™s 
start to be, you know, and it never went 
away, it™s still the same thing,
 I still feel why, why, why 
they did it to us? Why they 
did it small children things like th
is, and with no mercy wh atsoever. 
Q: When  did you begin to realize just ho
w much the Jewish people had suffered?  
A: Soon Œ so on you went out of the camp s,
 when we went out of the concentration 

camp and you see the Jewish people there.
 You know, you could have see people, 
you know, putting on the 
twill
 an d stuff, praying over ther
e, and then from the back 
he got shot because he™s putting on 
twill
, something like this, you know. And

43
another Œ the Œ stay there and they  pick up
 their hands and pray to God to come a 
miracle, they got killed. The miracle was th
ey got killed. So yo
u could see your own 
Jewish people. Look, I am Jewish. I wouldn
™t change my religion if you killed me. 
Even I went through all the 
prosecution thing, whatever th
ey did to me, it Œ I like 
very much where I am, but 
[indecipherable]
 we have our own Œ our own thing 
between the extremists and the thing, so 
i-it™s not such a good
 idea, I think we 
should get a little more
 better united than 
[indecipherable]
. In case God forbid 
something like this comes around, we shou ld be united, which 
we were not united 
those days, because there were too extreme, 
and they all Œ and they forced us to be 
extreme and we didn™t Œ we didn™t feel like
 being extreme, we just wanted to  be 
good Jewish people. And 
little bylittle starts up and 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: What you were just saying, was th
at a reference to before the war? 
A: Yes, before the war, when we were ki ds, the religion was so strong, they  force 

you to do things, which you didn™t even f
eel like doing all those things. Because 
they were so afraid you gon
 Œ you not Œ you gonna be a 
non-Jew. And I think that 
was the wrong way to force somebody to 
be a Jew, because you have to be the 
extreme way. You could be a go Œ a good Je
w, and you could be Jew in your heart, 
and Œ and not to be the extreme way, to be
 Œ to God and to  people. Fo r God an d for 
[indecipherable]
 you know, you have to be both 
ways, you cannot do th ings in one 

 
Interview with BernardPasternak  
 
October 22, 1997 
 

 
 
44
way. And we suffered a lot for that, because
 we were not united, even those days. 
When  I wanted to go to  
Palestine
, they told me I™m gonna be a goy, I™m not gonna 
be a Jew after all, I wanted to come to 
United States
, or any other place. I had be 
just in Œ in that place where in that 
town over there, where you co uld grow up a 
good Jew. The misery was so  bad in there, there was 
no food, there was no nothing, 
but the religion was on top. First the religio
n, and then it came 
the food. No, it wa Œ 
it was very hard to Œ and th en you coul
d see what™s going on, you know, and you 
have different idea, you th
ink different, and Œ and the 
problem arrived little by little.

Beginning Tape Two, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of a

Holocaust Memorial Museum
 
interview with

. This is tape two, side
 A
. And you were telling 
me about the decision to come to 
United States
 and let™s go with  how you got to 
the 
United States
. 
A: After I was in the Œ in 
Austria
 and 
Sa lzburg
, camp name was 
Reidenburg
, we 
prepared, you know, I mean
 people start moving out, they start going to 
Israel
, start 
going to  other countries. A lot of visas 
came in from almost all over the western 
world, that they take in so many people,
 so many people. And due to the fact my 
aunt, she wrote us we should co me to the 
United States
 first, so of course you have 
to prepare yourself
 to come to the 
State 
to see, because like my aunt said, so few 
were left of her Œ of my sister™s childre
n, I would like very mu ch you should come 
here first, but then you make your destin
ation further. So we start preparing to  do Œ 
come to the Œ the 
United States
. There was a lot of visas you could go in any other 
country, like my  brother-in-law went to 
South America
. And I had friends, they 
went to 
Australia
. They went all over the worl
d, but my  aim was now the 
United 
States
. So from 
Austria
 they did not take pe
ople yet to go to  the 
United Sta tes
. So 
we heard in 
Italy
 this Œ it™s a faster quota th
ere, you could go faster from 
Italy
 to 
the 
States
. So we went to 
Italy
. We went some friends and we went to 
Italy
. So, it

Œ it didn™t go so smooth either. We had to Œ from 
Salzburg
 we had to go to  
Innsbruck
. From 
Innsbruck Œ 
this is 
Austria
, from 
Innsbruck
 in the area, to go 
over the border to 
Italy
. So 
Italy 
was already independent, and they  had the Œ 
watching the border there, and a Œ soldier we
re there and we were trying to go over 
the border, they caught us a few times. That
™s why I will never forget those Italian 
that time. T h ey caught us twice, and due to
 the fact I speak Romanian, and it wasn™t 
too much a Œ of a differential for the Italian,
 so I start talking to the guy, he ask me, 
where you go? I says, I™m Œ I™m looking fo r 
a be Œ a better world. I™m looking for 
the Œ to settle myself. He 
say, you want to settle 
Italy
? I says, no, I have an aunt in 
the 
United States
. He says, okay, but right now wh at
 we have to do with you guy, 
we have to send you back, because that™s th
e rule. And next time we™ll see. It ju st 
happened, the guards there, 
they saw what™s coming, and they tu rn around th e other 
way and they say, 
Avanti
!
 Avanti
!
 Avanti
! Let™s go, let™s go, let™s go. So we went 
over the border, and we took a 
train, and we went into  
Meran
, not
 Milano
, 
Meran
. 
This is then the northern part between 
Austria
 and 
Italy
. So we went into that city 
over there. Of course, the Join
t was there already. And from 
Meran 
they made 
arrangements, and we went to 
Milano
. And also they had the camp there, only 
transit. 
Meran
 was a transit camp  and 
Mila no
 was a transit camp. So they, from 
there we sh Œ we went to a place not f-far from 
Meran
, they called it 
Chiari
 after, 

 
Interview with BernardPasternak

47
Chia ri
. In that they had a camp alrea
dy established to go to is Œ to 
Israel
, to go to 
any other place, or to 
United States
. It was a faster Œ y
ou know, faster Œ you get 
visa much faster over there 
to go wherever y
ou gonna go. So I wa
s in that place in 
Chia ri
 for a little while, and then  
I heard that if you go to 
Ba ri
, it™s much faster 
from 
Bari
. So we went by train, it took all nigh
t. The train were going a little faster 
than in 
Romania
, so we went all night, we went to 
Bari
. 
Bari
 had a camp  which it 
was the Œ you could have stayed there and there™s camp s there, but there was 
another place not far from 
Bari
, they called it 
Trani
. And we went to that camp, it 
also was about five hours or so with th
e train, approximately. So we went into  
Trani
 over there, and we stood there for a 
little while, a f Œ months already. The 
whole thing took a year and a half or some
thing like this, wh-what I™m telling you, 
between 
Austria
 and 
Italy
 all those things. So when it came, there was a delegation 
over there, and they  start taking a
ll the refugee people to go to the 
United States
. 
Now, it wasn™t so easy to come to 
United States
. First of all, you had to go through 
from he Œ head to tail, they
 Œ they checked
 you out. Well, they
 checked out you in 
general, and they find out 
Œ and they wanted to k
now if you have an ybody 
sponsoring you. And wanted 
to know if you have a trade and the feeling, and all 
those things. And how intelligent you are, 
they showed somethin
g to look. And in 
books, something to  figure out numb ers lik
e they do it for childre
n now, they put it

one, two, thr-three together. I did put them Œ I could put them all together because 
the colors were so funny, 
I could put them together. So
 the bottom line, everything 
was set, an d it Œ did they come th
at we are ready to go to the 
United States
. So 
from there, from 
Bari
 we went to 
Naples
. We stood there for a little while, I think 
they had some kind of a strike th
at time, so we 
hanged out to 
Na ples
. And Œ and 
then finally we had a boat, we had 
[indecipherable]
 a boat Œ matter of fact, they 
just brought some soldiers over to 
Italy
 and the boat was empty to go back , and the 
boat™s name was General 
Greely
. So we went in in the boat
 in there, and of course, 
after being so hungry all those years, I 
was w atching to eat because I shouldn™t get 
sick again. But I Œ I was always hungry.
 Matter of fact, I™m even hungry now. I 
mean, I cannot fu ll my self up from those bad 
days. So I went to the boat, we went 
in there and right away I volunteer to
 work. Because wherever I went in 
Italy
, I 
work ed. I made some  money in th e Œ all th
ose places w h ere I stood, I always look 
for a Œ sometimes I worked in the camp, they paid, be
cause the Italian government 
paid for th at. So I had some money and 
tell you, the first time I saw what life is 
when  I was in 
Italy
. First of all, the people were so
 nice. It™s a different type of 
people over there, and so friendly and 
generous. And I had money, and I never 
know how to live, and this Œ that™s Œ tell yo
u, this I Œ I know this is the best life 
what I ever had up til now, because all th
e Œ matter of fact, we went into Œ the 

 
Interview with BernardPasternak  
 
October 22, 1997 
 

 
 
49
government was so nice in general to 
us. We went in, when we were in 
Milano
, and 
there was a theater playing that time in this 
[indeciphera ble]
 
Milano
. I went in 
there and th-there was no room wh atsoever, but
 due to the fact we
 told them we are 
Œ we are fr Œ refugees, so Œ which I speak th
e language already. We are refugees, so 
right away  they made us at home and they
 took us in there to see the opera. And I 
was not much interested in opera thing, 
so I walked right out the other way, you 
know, they shouldn™t see me, 
they made so much effort 
to get me in. So I walked 
out. And there was other places which I was 
interested and they 
gave us so much 
respect for the Œ because we were refugee, 
profugo
 they called it, w e are refugees. 
Matter of fact, a lot of time you could have 
go from one place to the other over the 
train free because they know you are a re
fugee, and what you went through. So 
finally we go in the boat, General 
Greely
. I said Œ they ask volunteers, I went to 
work in the kitchen, where th
e food is. So I went to work 
in there in the kitchen, and 
I was doing Œ in 
Italy
 I traveled around from one pla
ce to the other one. I went to a 
lot of place; I went to 
Pompeii
, I went to other places. I went to see, you know, all 
the old places, and I went to 
Assisi
. Well, ha Œ you name it, I went all over 
Italy
 to 
see, because I had an opportun
ity to travel. So I worked in
 the kitchen in the boat, I 
work ed in  the kitchen. And the third day I got
 so sick, I got so si
ck with all the food. 
Matter of fact, it™s not only me, the whol
e boat got sick. Everybody got sick

50
[indecipherable]
 throw all the food around there. It was something. But I have 
some friends, they live now in 
Qu een s
 on Œ in 
New York
. And just a couple of 
guys, they were standing th ere and they were laughing 
[indeciphera ble]
 and then 
nothing affected them wh
atsoever. So it took a fe
w days pass the island of 
Ca pri
, 
and the boat to come in. And a few days 
after we come to ourselves you know, and 
we start acting a little bit normal. But the boa
t, it was so me kind of a storm, an d you 
could see the boat, you know, th-the plates 
in the Œ in the Œ in
 the mess hall where 
people were eating, you see, while they 
were eating, the soup was going one place 
to the other one, it was going back
 and forth with the boat and 
rockling
 the boat. 
And finally we come to our desti Œ 
destination. We c Œ we came to 
New York
. Now 
Œ 
Q: I want to ask you what
 expectations you had fo r 
America
 before you came to 
New York
. 
A: Well, I had Œ I figured I have a trade,
 which it didn™t do 
much good 
in this 
country because they were doi
ng different, but I had a start. And th-the whole thing 
was in my head just to settle down and Œ 
and to start living lik
e a human being, not 
to travel around all over. So when I arrive
d in the Œ in  the country , they Œ we came 
straight in the harbor in  
New York City
. I could never find out where the boat 
landed, it was in December 19
49. I could never 
find out which harb
or it come in. I 

 
Interview with BernardPasternak

51
wanted to go see the Œ really the place.
 Soon I walked down
, there was a lot of 
organization, there was Christian organiza
tion, other organization waiting for their 
refugees, because in the boat was not 
only Jewish people, 
because there was 
refugees from Œ almost from all the Easter
n Bloc. Some refugees were fr Œ they 
were Russians, from 
Russia 
they came. They were Po
lish, but they were in 
Russia
. 
Some refugees 
[indecipherable]
 they run away from the 
Germans, and some of 
them they run aw ay from the Russian. 
I don™t know what kind of a people, what 
their background was, what their pol 
Œ politic was, I don™t know. They were 
screened in Œ in 
Italy
 before they came, I don™t know
. So  they Œ those organizations 
right away we had Œ lik
e I had something written 
HIAS
 in my shirt, some people 
had different organization. So
 we had to go to the Œ ea
ch group. Matter of fact, I 
walked over to a Christian organization, I 
didn™t know what™s a
ll about, and then Œ 
and the Œ the woman was so nice,
 he says, no, he says, the 
Jude 
organization is 
right across on the other side on the hall. So wh en I came over, the 
HIAS 
on 
Lafayette 
Street
 
in 
New York City
 had already established 
for refugees who came 
over from the other side. They had room an
d board  and they were looking fo r jobs 
for them, they took us
 down town to the Œ in another pl
ace, to the Joint. I forgot the 
Œ the Œ the Œ the street over there, where th
ey  took us in th ere, and Œ and what the 

interview was for jobs, wh
at we know. So that time, w h en I came from 
Italy
, my 

 
Interview with BernardPasternak

52
sisters were here already. Th
ey ca Œ they Œ 
they came from 
Austria
 because they  
were single and it was easier to get them 
out. So my  sister and my  brother came 
already. And they waited me Œ they waite
d for me six months before they came, 
they waited for me. First of all, I could ha
ve come really befo
re. I didn™t want to 
leave 
Italy
. I had such a good life over there, 
why leave such a good life? Why go 
away? But my friends told 
me, this life is good, but 
United States
 even is a better 
life. I say, what do you mean? So 
they says to me, did you see the 
Marshall
 plan, 
an-and all over 
Austria
 and 
Germ any
 and 
It a l y
? I say yes. He says, you see, all the 
star Œ things comes fro m the 
United States
. Could you imagine if you go to the 
source wh ere you got all those things? And there how good it could we? So  I let 

my self talk in, I say you are right and 
we came over. And when we were Œ they 
were Œ the arrangement from the organiza
tion, they made arrangement we should 
go to 
Lafayette 
Street. But my sisters Œ si ste rs and 
my  brother told me, he says, it™s 
not so co zy with my  aunt, the way she wrot
e we should go. First thing my  aunt did, 
she looked all over our packag
es, she figured we have a lo t of money in there, we 
brought over from 
Europe
. So it was a different aim and 
so soon they 
saw me, they 
say, you not going to my  a
unt, he says, you go to the 
HIAS
 in th ere, and Œ and be 
established from over there, whatev er you ha
ve to do. You want to go from there. 
So I find they already give me all th
e information there, 
so I went to the 
HIAS
.

Now they took taxis, they 
had taxis to take from the 
Œ from the Œ from the thing Œ 
from the boat there, from the terminal th
ere. They had taxis to take you to  the 
HIAS
. I walked on the street, and I Œ with
 my  head down, I looked down . So  the 
guys asked me in Yiddish, he sa
ys to me, what are you looking fo r? 
Wassusto
(ph). 
I said well, I was told there™s a lo
t of money in the streets in the 
United States
, I 
thought maybe I could pick some Œ maybe I could pick  up some. The guy says to 
me in Yiddish 
[speaks Yiddish]
. Til you gonna see a dollar, you™ve Œ you™re gonna 
get black and blue til 
you gonna find a dollar here. You 
gotta work your head off. I 
says to my friend, see why we came? Y
ou gonna work your he
ad  off, you had such 
a good life in 
Italy
. So he says to me, one guy wh
ich you get a Œ still in contact Œ 
we still have a few friends we are in cont
act from the camps. Th
ey are spread all 
over. So , I says to him, okay, let™s see th
e bottom line what™s gonna happen. So we 
Œ I always wanted to  go back  to 
Italy
. Whatever I did, I wasn™t happy, I just wanted 
to go to 
Italy
, I want to go to 
Italy
. So  once got together with my  sister and my bro 
Œ my  brother. He sits down  there, he says
 to me, look, we know you had a good life 
in 
Italy
, better than we had in 
Austria,
 because it™s a different country, different 
[indecipherable]
 with better things in there. But I want to tell you so mething, my  
brother says to me, when you came with the 
boat, did you see the Statue of Liberty? 
I say, what™s the Statue of Liberty? 
Did you see somebody like a woman holding 

 
Interview with BernardPasternak

54
one hand up and one hand down , with a bo
ok? I say yeah. He sa
ys, you know what 
that means by us refugee? Th
e hand up means welcome to 
United States
. The hand 
down  means, you never gonna leav e the 
United States
. Here you gonna be buried 
and die in the 
United States
, you never gonna leave that. So we all start laughing 
and that™s what it happ
ened , exactly what happened, you just go 
[indecipherable]
 
think like this, so you™ll al
ways come back to the 
United States
. So we were in the 
HIAS
 a week or so, and then th
ey took us to a Œ to th
e Joint in there to start 
interviewing us. Wh at kind of Œ they had a 
big Œ big build ing over 
there, just Œ I just 
forgot the place. And there was a lot of 
people, they interv iew you in your own 
language, 
[indeciphera ble]
 wh at job you could know, wh
at job you could do. And I 
told them what I could do, and Œ but in th
e meantime til they fi
nd something, I Œ my  
aunt had a cousin here
, and he was a tinsmith. So in th
e meantime, I Œ I Œ of Œ I just 
Œ I Œ I was without work maybe Œ maybe, ma ybe two months. So  he says to me, 
look, a temporary thing til you get the real 
jo b, you come work for me. I have work 
for a Œ once in a while I have a little work
. I do roofing, I do othe
r thing, repairing. 
So I says, okay. So got a few 
dollars that time, for Œ so I 
went to work for him, he 
was someplace in Œ in 
Brooklyn
, and you had Œ 
go travel from 
New York
 to
 
Brooklyn
, if you don™t know you 
Œ you know, you don™t know your way, you don™t 
know the language. So I suppos
ed to start eight o™clock, I 
used to leave 5:30 in the 

 
Interview with BernardPasternak  
 
October 22, 1997 
 

 
 
55
morning because I left a few hours for goi
ng from one place to the other one, one 
train Œ I traveled all over the city before 
I re Œ I reached the destination. I think it 
was in 
Grammerton
(ph) Avenue in 
Brooklyn
, he had a job, til I got used, better 
and better. And my  uncle wanted to show off 
that he™s a real American when I used 
to go downtown from him fro
m Œ fr Œ when  I used to go 
with him, travel around 
from one place to the other one. So he bought a newspaper, he looks in the 
newspaper Œ I don™t even 
think he knew how to  read
 that time because the 
newspaper wasn™t even  straight. So he take
s the paper, looks in 
it, he comes to the 
station the next day, he throws it in the ga
rbage. He says, you see, that™s what you 
do in 
United States
. You lo ok in th e newspaper, you have no time to, you th row it 
away. I don™t even think he knows anything in
 that thing because he couldn™t read at 
all. Why he wanted to  make an impressi
on to me, that he Œ and then  I went out 
after, I went out with my  cousins and th
ey  took me around, they  took me to ice 
cream parlor. And I go in there and get an  ice cream. She says, you know wh at you 

with that? You lick it. I said, no kidding, I sa
id, I didn™t know you lick ice cream. I 
says, you think I come from the mountains, I didn™t have ice cream in 
Italy
, or in 
any other place? So Œ 
but I didn™t want 
[indecipherable]
 so I™m glad you told me, 
at least you teach me something, you know, 
weth Œ important thing. So finally I got 
Œ I went back for the interv
iew and for the job, and they
 still couldn™t find the right 

 
Interview with BernardPasternak  
 
October 22, 1997 
 

 
 
56
job for me. I find some people who we 
came over with the boat together, I ask 
them, where you wo rking? So  
they told me, I™m working 
there and there in a metal 
factory, but it™s so dirty over there, we c
ouldn™t take the dirt. So he says, but I™m 
sure with your background
, I think you could get a job over there and you could 
work  in there, provided you lik
e the grease and the dirt. So I went in the place for an 
interview, and the guy was talk
ing to me in Eng
lish, what the heck, I know English, 
I know a few word, okay, okay 
[indeciphera ble]
. So he says to me, first I want you 
to go try my  friend, he has a place over ther
e and see if he could 
get you a job. So I 
went over to the guy ov
er there someplace in 
Manhattan
. I went in there, I see 
people working, cutting wood and other thi
ng, just Œ just a regular work. Went in 
there, he start talking to me, I didn™t u
nderstand not one word  
he was saying. I had 
to wo rk harder, I say okay, okay, I don™t 
understand a word. I mean, to give me the 
courtesy, I speak so many languag es, can™t 
you talk to  me in a different type of 
language? So was sticking to 
the English. So then I went 
back to the Œ to the place 
where the guy told me he is working. I we
nt in there and comes out Œ the guy comes 
out first, interviews me and then the bo
ss comes out and checks out the interview, 
see Œ he looks at me, he says, you know,
 I see something in you. I™m gonna give 
you a job. And I™m gonna try you out, see wh
at you could do. So I went in in that 
factory over there, ma chinery, dust flyi
ng all over, because that time they didn™t 

 
Interview with BernardPasternak  
 
October 22, 1997 
 

 
 
57
care too mu ch about the pollution, all those 
thing. And I went in there and I would 
take anything, because if
 you have no language, I me
an you don™t know the 
language, you have to  take 
what you can. So I went in
 there and start working.  
Q: When you came to the 
United States
, did you feel welcom
e by the Americans?  
A: I felt welcome almo st by everybody 
because I have my tattoo numb er from 
Auschwitz
, and it was summer to o, and I was going without the jacket. And matter 
of fact, some of the American people, they 
even got up and get me
 the seat, ev en the 
older people, they says, here, sit d o wn, 
I see you standing up. But I was very 
welcome by the Jewish people in general, 
talking about the Œ the refugees, wa Œ all 

they went through. And also some of the 
people and Œ and Œ in 
Œ in the job, they 
were afraid that something is wrong with 
me because I went to a camp , or ma ybe I 

did some kind of a criminal 
activ ities I did, why di Œ they put me in a camp, because 
they couldn™t understand why 
I was, you know, in prison 
for something like this. So 
it was very hard to ex plain, which I could 
not explain, but after they saw pictures, 
and they saw the newspapers, so they star
t to get a little bit educated more, a-and 

start to accept me. But I should say, the wo
rst Œ somebody to call me  Jew, or thing 
like this, yes I do have encounter with
 the people who were working. I Œ I 
understand already a little bit, and I reme
mb er one guy used to call me hey Jew-
boy, come over here, hey, Jew-boy. I 
figured that™s the way you call somebody 

 
Interview with BernardPasternak

58
over, til somebody else told me what it me an s. But I couldn™t do nothing anyhow, 
and I didn™t want to start up anything beca
use like I said, I was afraid  for the job, 
an-and that guy was a little leader over ther
e. And on the end, we worked together 
with the guy, but I never trusted him becaus
e he never trusted me either. So he was 
doing so me mechanical thing and I was 
doing different thing. And I did not 
encounter anything, I would say, went in in
 a store, thing like this, cause Œ what Œ 
no Œ I wouldn™t say ant Œ anti-
Semitic thing when I came 
to this country. Maybe I 
didn™t understand, I didn™t speak the language, but 
[indecipherable]
 I think it 
turned out pretty good. 

Q: Did people ask you about your experi
ences when you came? Did Americans ask 
you? 
A: Yes, there was a lot of talk abou
t it when they went
 to the shul in 
France
, and 
when  I use Œ started Œ started going out with
 girl, they ask me the background, what 
happened . And like I say, so
on they saw my number, th
ey know I went through 
hell. And they tried to understand, but I 
couldn™t make nobody understand, because 
nobody could believe it.  

Q: What did you Œ what did you tell them? 
A: I told them the experiences. I was a 
kid I was taking away because I was Jewish, 
and I was taking so many different thing, 
and exterminate the fa
mily, just because 

 
Interview with BernardPasternak  
 
October 22, 1997 
 

 
 
59
they were Jewish. And it was very hard to 
understand for the people in general. But 
later on when I start already speaking th
e language, then it was a different Œ I 
explain it to them different and then they
 start to accept what I went through.  
Q: You said that you started going out 
with girls and Œ and 
started having a Œ a 
social life. Tell me about your soci
al life in your early days in the 
United States
. 
A: When I start working first in the job, 
I was starting with 70 cents an hour. Bu t I 
would say th e boss liked me and I start wo
rking overtime. So it was a heck of a 
dirty job in general. It was so dirty that 
a shower wouldn™t take off that dirt, that 
black stuff. But I already had money, so 
you start thinking about settling down and 
start having a different social life. So I used
 to go out with Œ with girls in general, 
but somehow, we were afraid Œ the refugee, 
they were afraid for 
the American girls. 
Why? Soon you start talking to them, the firs
t question, do you ha
ve a car? I said, I 
don™t even  have a bicycle, not a car, I mean 
I just came, you want me to have a car? 
So then  I was afraid, I didn™t date it the 
second time, because who knows if she asks 
for a car, what will happen later on, what 
you ask? So, I didn™t 
Œ I didn™t bother. But 
a few years later, about two years later 
I did bought a car, because I had better 
opportunities to date girls. So I took th em 
out. I ha Œ I™m very poor, you know, in 
the sense of direction, I only know Œ if I 
go out someplace and turn  back, sometimes 
I lose my  sense of direction. And I al
so, I am colorblind, so I had those two

problems. And Œ but those girl
s, they know their way an
d I tell them I want to go 
there, I say, but I never been there before
, which it wasn™t true, I was there before, I 
Œ but I didn™t know how to get there again.
 So they directed 
me over there, and I 
had a 1942 
Dodge
. I had a lot of trouble with that car, but I kept it running ju st to 
get better dates and which it happened to me
 and Œ but the thing is this, I still Œ I 
was sitting in the car one time, I n ever forg et, and I said, enough is enough, I say, I 
should settle down and start 
living a family life. And I sa
y, well, you find the right 
girl, you say, you ju st can™t jump  into 
something like this. So we did Œ we dated 

very few American girls, and mo st of th em we dated our own type of girls. Not 

necessary Romanian, it could be from any ot
her country we dated, because our view 
was different, our aim was different and we
 had nobody you know
, we had to  stick 
to each other, so it was a different type of dating.  

Q: S-So  how then did you meet your wife? 

A: Well, I was going her Œ with a girl from 
Czechoslovakia
. And you know, if 
somebody pushes you, you push
 back, you know, you Œ y
ou Œ you go a step back. 
She was pushing me to get married, she 
was nice lady, good looking, everything 
was right, but somehow, I was pressed t
oo mu ch, you say, wh en you gonna marry, 
when you gonna marry? And I wasn™t ready 
that time. S o  that time Œ the refugees 

used to get together in 
Manhattan
 in 
Ho tel Dip loma t
. You always find, whenever

you wanted to go to  a dance,
 or you want to meet some
body, you could meet them 
at two places, on front of the 
HIAS
, 
Lafayette
 Street, or in Œ in 
Hotel Diplomat
, 
there you could meet. So I went with he
r to a dance. Didn™t 
know how to dance 
really, but I went to a dance. I start lear
ning how to  dance, and so we saw a lot of 
friends there, we got together a lot of fri
ends over there. And then  she says to me, 
meet my friend. So I meet Œ met h er friend,
 and said hi, things like this. And then I 
look in the friend, I say gee, I would 
like to marry that girl, because she had 
everything what I really wa
nted. I always liked black eye, dark eyes. I alwa Œ 
because 
Europe
 mo st of them got blue eyes Œ matte
r of fact, I have blue eyes, too Œ 
I always wanted somebody in the darker side, because most
 of them are, like I said, 
blonde. And she had all the th
ing I Œ what a girl could have, and I wanted to meet 

her very bad, and so little by little, I ask 
her for a date, but she had somebody Œ 
going with somebody. I didn™t
 succeed the first time, I 
didn™t succeed the second 
time, so I kept on pushing, not the strong 
way, because I had a lesson from the other 
girl, you had to approach very easy. So  
I Œ finally we had a date. She lived in 
[indecipherable]
 by her aunt. She also from eu Œ 
Europe
, she came from 
Transylvania
, 
Ro mania
 and 
Hun g a r y
, and she was by an aunt
 or by a cousin in 
Mount Vernon
. She came in 1946 as a kid the Œ w
ith th e children transport. And I 
went out with her once or twice and Œ and lo oks like she was not too mu ch

interested in me and you can™t press someth
ing like this, has to co
me mostly natural, 
and we broke off. That time, I have in Œ in
 papers here, that I 
Œ the Korean War was 
on that time and I went to register to the 
army. I was trained already, might as well 
do so me service for the 
United States
. So I went to register it, and the registration 
to the army was 
[indecipherable]
 
Arthur 
Avenue. And I got my  registration thing 
and then they called me back to
 see Œ fi-first they gave me 
1-A
, they took Œ call me 
back, I passed all the physical, I passed everything. I didn™t pass the language, I 
didn™t speak the language, ju
st a little bit. So the guy says to me, language is no 
good, we need somebody who 
speaks English and we have 
no schooling over there, 
things like this. And you could make one mi
stake, the whole platoon could die fe Œ 

because you don™t speak the language. And I got 
4-F
. And I™m carrying around the 
1-A 
and the 
4-F
 with me since I Œ when I went to
 register to the army. So I didn™t 
succeed. My wife now, she fi
nd out Œ which her name is 
Bella
, 
Brocha
(ph) in Œ in 
Yiddish, she find out that I am going to th e 
Korea
 Œ to the war. So she picked up 
the phone and sh e asked me, is true you ar
e going to the army? 
I say s yeah, I just 
said, I™m supposed to go to
 the army, I am w aiting. And 
then the meantime I Œ  give 
me a lot of courage, because she called, 
and I said, would you like to go out fo r a 
date? She says, okay, before you go to  the 
Korean War, I go out wi
th you. So I went 
out with her once, I went out with 
her twice, and it came through th at 
4-F
. She was

going with somebody, if she 
cared, she didn™t care too mu
ch. The cousin where she 
was living, so she says, gee I™m torn Œ my
 wife says, I™m torn
 between two things, 
she says. I got this guy, and I got this guy. 
I says, what do I do? 
So the uncle, or the 
cousin, he says to her, look, I don™t know
 mu ch  about the other guy, but I could tell 
you this; 
Bernie 
co me s fro m 
Mamurish
(ph) and I know all those people, they work 
very hard, and I™m sure yo
u wouldn™t go hungry. And it lo
oks like he did the trick 
and finally we go out again. And we went in 
Mount Vernon
 in the Œ and parked 
there in the park there, we
 sat down over there and I ask her, I says, look, would you 
try to get mo re serious and thing? So we 
went Œ went around for a while. A serious 
thing, they called it steady that time. Bu
t my  family wasn™t too keen about her, 
because my wife has a Œ she 
talks a little loud, but she m eans nothing, but that™s the 
way she talks and they couldn™t accept he
r to Œ right away. But I saw in her a 
different thing. I saw in her a smart, a
nd knows what she™s doing. And I saw in her 
that we could have a nice future togethe
r, because I am not a businessman. I would 
be very well off if I were to be a busi
nessman. I™m not a busin essman type and she 
is. So she had Œ she was always a step ah
ead of me, whatever 
I wanted to do. So 
then, wh en I was talking to 
my  family, I says look, I says look, this girl who I™m 
gonna marry, she has more than
 Œ than you think with Œ w
ith all the things she says, 
we Œ so they  said look, it™s your life and you
r decision, things like this. If she says Œ

64
because I wanted Œ not that 
I wanted to get their perm
ission to marry her, I just 
wanted th ey  should give me Œ you know, to
 say look, I don™t want to divide the 
family. And then th ey says, if you think so
 Œ so highly ab out her, we™ll accept your 
Œ your knowhow, your thinking.
 And let™s see, let™s plan 
and see what™s gonna work  
out. And we had our cousin , he was in the 
jewel business, and we™re talking to him 
for a ring. This cousin Œ I didn™t want 
to buy a ring and she shou-shouldn™t like it. 
By the way, I already had 1500 dollars save
d, which I was in the country two years, 
and that™s a heck of a lot of money because
 I work so much ove
rtime. And I wanted 
her to encourage that Œ like 
the cousin said, that she not gonna go 
hungry, so I 
wanted to encourage her, a
nd I was working th at time seven days a week and 10 - 
11 hours a day. I had a check
 of 250 dollar. I was workin
g 70 cents an hour. So 
when we went to take out the marriage licen
se that time, I had loose change, I says 
to her, I says, look, 
Bella
, I don™t have any ch ange yo
u could see, but I have my  
check, you cash it tomorrow, and you pay fo
r the license, two dollar, which I tease 
her up Œ up to today I say, you paid for me. So she give 
Œ paid th e two dollar, I gave 
her the check, and sh e saw the check 250 dollar 
[indecipherable]
 have to make 
over 300, 350 th at time. And as saw the check, she was 
[indecipherable]
 right 
away, she says, gee, this guy makes a lot of
 money. Because people used to make 
60, 70 dollar a week that time,
 and I had 250 dollar, single guy. So I don™t know if 

 
Interview with BernardPasternak

65
that impressed her to marry me, because 
she Œ she didn™t care for money, never 
cared for money in general. So Œ but it 
Œ it helped, I wouldn™t say it didn™t help. 
And she Œ they took the check and cashed 
it, you know, and Œ an
d I says, you open 
a bank Œ we Œ we were only talking ab ou
t getting engaged. And she had the cousin  
that he was in the jewelry business, and 
I had 1500 dollar, and then  she picked  out 
the ring of 1200 dollar. So it™s Œ were a 
little over a carat, a carat and a quarter, 
something like that. She pick
ed out that ring, so I paid
 the 1200 dollar for the ring.

general, for me. And she was Œ she was mo
re religious, because my wife™s family 
comes from mo re a religious background. 
Not that my family didn™t come, but it 
was a different background beca
use he had a brother, he was a 
shochet 
and some 
rabbis in the family. So she says to me, I 
want to bring up the Œ my  children Jewish, 
the real Jewish way. And like I was saying, 
we were very smart,
 in general, and I 
went Œ I went along right away. The only 
question I says, where the heck you gonna 
get so mu ch money? I says, there™s nobody 
gonna give you here, you have to do it 
all wi Œ we have to do it all on our own. 
She says, we™ll make it, God will help us 
and we™ll make it. She also was telling me a 
story, wh en they Œ th ey build a school, 
the 
Westchester 
Day School in 
Mamaro neck
, and she went to visit there with Œ 
with the family there, wher
e she was staying. And that 
was in the Œ probably in ™46 
- ™47, wh en they build that school. So sh
e says to the family
, this is where I™m 
gonna send my  children. And she was telli
ng me the story, so she says, I™m gonna 
send them in that school. And they  Œ yo
u know, they  were very, very expensive 
schools, things like this. So she says, I™m
 gonna wo rk too. I says, how you gonna 
work with small kid, thing like this. So
 she says, I™ll mana ge somehow. She was 
work ing bi Œ the y
ear we had our son 
Jerry
, but she was work ing in the dress line. 
She was so good on 
that dress line that she becam
e a samp le maker. Y ou™re not 
gonna believe this, she worked
 til the day she gave birth. 
Like she™s worked til five

o™clock an d eight o™clock was I took her to
 the hospital. And she was so good in  
that thing, that where she 
was work ing, she had to go 
to the docto r every week  or 
so, and this fellow by the dress line, he 
took her to the doctor, waited for her, 
because she was so good. And when she ha
d the baby, the Œ the Œ the Œ the fellow 
came over to take the sample 
back, because she didn™t even
 finish  the sample. Now, 
when  our ambition was very mu ch to see how we could better ourself, and even  

how to better somebody else™s too, you kno
w, with who Œ people you are together, 
learn one from each other one. So for Œ we
 moved in an apartm
ent, it was in the 
Bronx. And it was 
[indecipherable]
 over there, it was in the dirt floor. And we 
were Œ when I went to the hospital, I was 
so excited that my wife was sitting down, 
she says, give me a glass of water, becaus
e we went to the hospital. I say why? The 
Œ the water busted. And I got such a bang 
I jumped up. I thou
ght somebody hit me 
in the back. And when
 we got up she said, don™t wo
rry, don™t be scared. Th-The 
water busted, we gotta go to the hospita
l She said, give me a glass of water 
[indecipherable]
 call a taxi. You think I could ca
ll a taxi? I didn™t ev en know how 
to Œ I was so excited, I couldn™t even call th
e taxi. And then she says to me, give me 
a glass of water, I don™t feel too good. No
w who drank the water?
 I drank the water, 
because Œ and sh e said, it™s okay, I™m gon
na get my own water, because you can™t

got a taxi to go to Jewish

68
Memo rial Hosp ital, and th e guy didn™t ev
en know where Jewish Memorial Hospital 
is, the taxi driver, so she had to explain wh
ere it is. So I went into the hospital, went 
in there to the hospital. 
And by the time I turn around, I didn™t do an ything, 
somebody comes by, she says it™s a boy. Fa
st. And the next day I went back to  
work, I went up 
[indecipherable]
 and the next day I went back to  work . I brought 
the kid home on third floor, but we couldn™t 
Œ it was close to go 
to work for me, but 
it really wasn™t a place to raise family 
because third floor. 
The neighborhood was 
good, so we went to 
Cro tona
 Park. They had a park
 there, they call it 
Crotona
 
park. 
[indecipherable]
 So to get this apartment, we
 are now, we had to pay th e Œ 
that time you had to  pay Œ they  call it the key money 
[indecipherable]
 you had to 
pay. We paid a few hundred  dollar to get 
this apartment. And then we Œ we had 
somebody who knows in Œ in 
Yonkers
. They lived in the Œ in 
Hilltop Acres
, the 
place was called 
Hilltop Acres
. They lived  over there and they says, i-i-if you get Œ 
go there and you talk to the 
landlord in there 
probably, there™s a 
lot of development 
there, lot of apartment. And 
also you had to  pay that time,
 too. So  we give the guy 
some money over there, he gives us a thr
ee room apartment over there. But that was 
not right away, because it took time, and 
by the Œ by that time she was pregnant 
with the second kid and Œ and on th e same 
thing happened, but th
is Œ this Œ this 
child was not born in Jewish
 Memo rial, he was born in  
Bronx Levin 
Hospital.

[indecipherable]
 
Bronx Levin
 on there. So we went to 
that hospital. I was a little 
more calm, I had a little experience because
 it was two years. And when he was a 
few months, second boy, we had that apar
tment, in wh ich they called 90 si Œ 
Hilltop Acres
, the number was 96. So we lived 
there for quite a 
while. And then I 
had another child, it was also a boy. But the 
thing is, they all Œ they all were born Œ 
one was born June 17. My s
econd child was born June 18. 
And I wanted to have an 
anniversary present, he shou
ld be born in June the 27
th
, so he stretched it til a 
minute past the 12 and he came June the 28
th
. So I lost out in 
that one. Then we 
went to that new apartment, which it was in 
Hilltop Acres
. And we had the three 
room apartment. And soon this
 Œ the other one, they went 
to school. First they went 
to kindergarten and went to school, and 
my  wife picked up something Œ something 
else. She picked up real estate. 
Q: How did you Œ how 
did you pick the na
mes for your sons? 
A: Well, where she came Œ where my wife ca
me to this cousin we Œ she called him 
uncle, but he was a cousin. His daughter go
t married and the doctor said she cannot 
have any ch ildren. So  she wanted to do 
something real important for those people. 
So the first son was named after this c
ousin™s father. His name is the Œ i-is 
[indecipherable]
 English is the name 
Jerry
. So he was named after his cousin, 
think. No w, my  second child I couldn™t name
 after my  father because the first name 

 
Interview with BernardPasternak  
 
October 22, 1997 
 

 
 
70
my father was 
Moishe Zev
 and Œ and Œ an d my  son™s the f Œ name is 
Yehude
(ph)
 
Ze v
, so I couldn™t name any mo re
 after my father because my
 father™s name, half of 
them is by the first son. So my wife Œ so , I was talking to my family and I says, 
look, I like to give a name and what can 
I Œ I can™t name after my mother because 
it™s not a girl. So we had a discussion and 
I talked to my wife. So my father Œ I 
named him after my father father, 
Shmol
(ph) 
David
 also to be close, my father 
should have a name. S o  this is the way I 
got the second name. And this cous Œ the 
first name always belongs to the wife, the 
second name to the man and if the third 
one, it goes again to the wi
fe. So the third name was 
Yithza k
(ph) 
Shlomo
(ph), and 
my wife named him after her father and afte
r a brother who also 
got perished in the 
Holocaust. So this is the way 
we picked the three names.  
Q: What did you tell your sons about
 your childhood befo re the war? 
A: Well, first of all, what I tell them, it™s 
very hard to believe, 
but they only believe 
because the parents are telling them. I tried 
to tell them what ha
ppened with those 
people, what happened if people are not 
united, if Œ what happened if, you know, 
you don™t trust each other. And even a
ll those things you know, it Œ I was 
persecuted because I™m a Jew an d I hope yo
u gonna keep up the faith and be a Jew 
because they didn™t want you to be a Œ me 
to be a Jew, but I kept up the faith, and I 
want you ke Œ people to keep up the faith
. And th ey promise me
 th ey gonna do it, 

 
Interview with BernardPasternak  
 
October 22, 1997 
 

 
 
71
and which they are doing it right now, wh
ich I™m very proud of them, what they 
doing. Soon my  older boy 
Jerry
, so soon Œ so on he was old enough to go to  school, 
so he went to kindergarten for Œ he we
nt to kinderg arten in the regular public 
school. And then like my  wife, she kept her promise and she sent him to 
Westchester
 Day School fo r regular schooling. It
 was a quite a ride from Œ I lived 

already in 
Yonkers
, from 
Yonkers
 to
 Mamaroneck
. And they said th
e only city in 
the 
Westchester
, they have no transportation. A
ll the other cities, they have 
transportation from one school to the other 
one, even private. So we had to get 

together people there and we
 had a school bus, we paid for the school bus. But 
sometime we had to  go ourself 
and pick him up from the school 
[indecipherable]
. 
When  my  other boy was ready to go, we se
nd him to the same school over there, to 
Westchester
 Day School on th e Œ 
Ma ma ron e ck
, and also we did with the third 

boy, we send him to 
Westchester
 Day School til they gradua
ted. Ma Œ but the third 
boy, wh en he was about a year old or so, my
 wife went to work with real estate, she 
became a broker. She took the 
kid with her, wherever sh e was going, because I did 
not trust a babysitter. I never went to a m
ovie while the kids were small, I never 
trust a babysitter, because a 
boy, you know, they™re a lit
tle on the wild side, and I 
did Œ wh erever I could entertain myself, I 
always used to take
 the kids along with 
me, in general. Matter of fact, there was 
one day they were playing cowboy th at I 

 
Interview with BernardPasternak  
 
October 22, 1997 
 

 
 
72
was cowboy and Indian and I was so tired
 from working the seven days a week and 
I lay down one time in the afternoon. 
It was a Sunday, cause Sunday we only 
worked eight hours, so I came home and laid down a little bit. What happened, we 
were playing cowboy and Indian  and th ey
 cracked their heads on th e radiator, we 
had to go run to the hospital 
and put them all three stitch
es on. So that time I, for 
sure I didn™t trust anybody to
 watch the kids, til they start growing up a little bit. 
Q: What did you tell your sons about 
your parents and Œ 
and your family? 
A: Oh, we told them thi
ngs, you know, make them understand wh at happened . 
Also, I did not have to tell them 
to o much because 
the schools, the 
Westchester
 
Day School, they had classes for this and th
ey explain it to them
 what happened on 
the Œ it was much easier for 
me that somebody else told them, because I get very 
emotional to start talki
ng ag ain wh at happened. 

Q: Did th ey understand why th
ey  didn™t have grandparents? 
A: Yeah, after they explain it in their 
schooling, too. They  used to  ask if 
[indecipherable]
 my  grandparents, where are my  gr
andparents? So they Œ they start 
to understand why they  don™t
 have any gran dparents, an
d why we were all alone. 
With all the family, with all the friends 
you had, you had to 
make it on your own, 
whatever it is. Even the Œ 
where my wife was staying 
[indecipherable]
 there was a 
little girl that time, she was 16 Œ 15 years 
old, and my wife ca
me out to meet me

someplace and I says, where are the children?
 And she says, I left them with the 
little girl. Y ou know, I st Œ I did not go into 
that affair Œ that affair, I went straight 
home to watch the kids, and I send the girl
 home. I said, I don™t trust nobody. And I 
Œ I think it was some kind of a Bar Mitzva
h, whatever, and I didn™t Œ she made 
arrangements, she was so Œ she worked so
 hard to get arrangement to have a 
babysitter and I didn™t trust them, so I miss
ed that affair, because since they had the 
stitches on in the head, so that time I didn™t 
trust them at all, 
til they grow up.  
Q: Besides asking ab out grandparents, wh
at other questions did they  ask you? 
A: They ask me Œ it was very interested, th ey used to came home and sh ow me their 
report cards, how good they ar
e doing in school, which th
ey, they were brilliant, all 
of them in school. So they came home with
 their report card, and 
they said they got 
straight 
As
, they got straight fives, whatever. So
 Œ fours Œ four were the best, they 
show me five fours. So he ask me, my  older boy 
Jerry
, he says, Dad, four, you 
don™t say nothing? This the best. I say, 
you know how many fours I had when  I was 
in school? So he say, yeah? You had so ma
ny fours? He goes over to his mother. So 
he says, Mom, Dad had so many four, was 
he so brilliant in school? She says, no, 
all the four was failing, he failed every su
bject, he failed in school. Because wh at 
can I tell a child from the scho
ol when I only made four
 grades? Four elementary 
grade school. Matter of fact, I went five 
because the fifth one I Œ I went over the 

 
Interview with BernardPasternak  
 
October 22, 1997 
 

 
 
74
second grad e, I went over twice. How could 
you go in  a school wh
en  they beat you, 
when  you have a yellow Œ and th-the yellow 
stars came out that time, so it was very 
hard. But they went to thei
r mother because my wife is
 mo re educated, she has Œ 
went to school over here, 
she was younger, and she was 
very good in Romanian 
schools ca Œ too, wh ich I was very bad. 
So  they never came around to ask me 
question about school and things like that, 
they always went to
 their mother and 
with books, with all those th
ings, she understood more. 
Q: As your sons grew up,
 did you tell them about 
your wartime ex periences? 
A: Yeah, we kept on Œ but a lot of time 
when I start explaining something, says 
yeah, we just had a class about 
Auschwitz
, we just had a class 
about this, about this 
Œ this liberation, about this, whatever ha
ppened. So it was Œ it wasn™t so emotional 
for me to explain them all those things, 
but they Œ they says
 to me, I will never 
forget the thing you went thro
ugh, even I don™t mention it,
 they said to me. So we 
have very good relationship and 
the contact all the time, so Œ 
Q: Did th ey ask you questions? 

A: Yeah, they kept on asking me questions 
in general, how th ey took us away , and 
who was there. I did not want to give th em hatreds, you know, we Œ the Hungarian 
took us away, to say the Hu ngarians did. I 
did not want to mention any nation in  it. I 
just tell them, the thing was Nazi that
 time, from Œ from Œ control from the 

 
Interview with BernardPasternak  
 
October 22, 1997 
 

 
 
75
Germans. And I say, of course there wa
s a lot of col Œ colla Œ collaborators and 
different kind of nations, so 
if you want me Œ they get togeth er with somebody and 
say oh maybe you killed my grandparents, th
ey see somebody, so
 I didn™t want to 
have this to happen, I want them to fi
nd out a lot of thing their way, too. 
Q: Was there something that 
you would have want
ed your sons to ask you th at they 
never asked you? 
A: Well, they could have asked me mo re 
questions about the Holocaust things, but 
they already know from the schooling, so th
ere was really a Œ no a lot of things 
which they could have asked me. I wanted
 to hear it from them they ask me, I 
wanted to  get in Œ mo re involved in  thin
g they  are involved. 
Bu t they know it from 
other people, from other places they go. 
So they know what
™s going on, what 
happened .  

Q: If they didn™t ask you the questions that
 you wanted them to ask, do you th ink 
there might be perhap s any other 
reasons why they didn™t ask you? 
A: It could be they didn™t
 want to hurt me because th
ey know Œ th
ey know I™m 
going th rough ev en now, emotional a lot of ti
me. It™s fi Œ it™s Œ look, it™s Œ we are in 
‚97 now, I got liberated in 1945. I still see 
w h at™s going on, I still see everything in 
front of my eyes. I still run to the windows,
 a lot of time I look out, I Œ did I really 

 
Interview with BernardPasternak  
 
October 22, 1997 
 

 
 
76
liberated, and I really free? No Œ so they
 know how I felt about it, maybe they 
restrain themselves in a 
lot of questions to ask. 
Q: After the day school, what kind of 
education did your 
Œ your sons have? 
A: After the day school they finished in
 Westchester
 Day School Œ first I™m talking 
about 
Jerry
. He went Œ he went Œ he wanted  to 
continue with his Jewish education, 
because they were very, very 
good Jewish Œ and by the way, 
Jerry 
won the 
valedictoria
(ph) in Hebrew, he was so good in that 
Westchester
 Day School. So he 
was making all the speeches in Hebrew that time. And from there he went on to 
Yeshiva
 University, which is in 
Manhattan
 in 
Amsterdam 
Av enue. So  he went in 
to that school and kept on 
his education in there. And 
of course, it looks like one 
son follows the other step, and it™s three brot
hers, and they been raised so close, so 
the same thing what happened with 
my  other son, he finished the 
Westchester
 Day 
School and then he went to 
Yeshiv a
 University. Well my thir
d boy had a couple of 
more years to finish 
Westchester 
Day School. It was very hard  to travel out to 
Westchester 
Day School to pick him 
up, to bring him back for certain classes they 
had. So we decided we gonn
a have to change school fo r 
him, to make it a little bit 
closer to 
Yeshiva
 Univ ersity. This way you pick 
him up, you pick them up all one 
time. So there was a school, the 
[indeciphera ble]
 School. So we registered him 
over there, in 
[indecipherable]
 and he finished his two year there. He was so 

 
Interview with BernardPasternak  
 
October 22, 1997 
 

 
 
77
advanced from 
Westchester
 Day School that he always
 was ahead of the game in 
school. Til Œ in there, there was no transpor
tation at all, so we didn™t have a bus like 
in 
Westchester
 Day School. So  what happened in
 the morning? My wife, before 
she went to the real estate business, sh
e took them to school every day by day for 
years and years and I picked him up at nigh
t, six, seven o™clock,
 day by day, all the 
time. This is the way they 
got their transportation back  and fo rth. That™s not all, 
sometime they had games, they had other 
thing, and I didn™t want him to Œ you 
know, to hold them back from anything, so 
we took them back at night, sometimes I 
fall asleep in the car waiting til they get ou t from the game, and this went on til they 

all finished, and they all finished 
Yeshiv a
 Univ ersity school. 
Q: During th is time, tell me, how was your
 Œ your business, your
 Œ your job world 
developing? 

A: Well, I start working in this metal pl
ant, and I was doing ve
ry hard work, you 
know, like Œ like a plain labor or things lik
e this. And this boss who hired me, after 
he says he sees something in me, after 
a year or so, I was performing very good. 
Usually in that plant what 
they did is, if you were wo
rk ing a whole Œ a whole year 
without being out for any good
 reason, you used to get an award. I always got the 
award because I was never out. And my  record was so great. So I didn™t even  know 

this, this guy was an expert in Œ they bo
th was an expert in 
metal. And he Œ one 

 
Interview with BernardPasternak  
 
October 22, 1997 
 

 
 
78
time he was watching me, I didn™t even 
see him watching me. I was work ing 
piecework at that time, you really had to
 move. So he was watching me, and he 
came over here, he came Œ I was speaking 
English already, w
ith a Yiddish en Œ 
accent. So he came over to me, he says, he
y listen. I don™t have a section head  over 
here, would you like to take over the secti
on? Maybe 30 people in there. Me? M e? I 
don™t even  speak the language the right 
way. How you want me to do something 
like that? I don™t even write, I 
can™t even spell. He says, we™ll give you a secretary, 
we™ll give you anythi
ng you want, just take over th
e area. He had 30 people in 
there, I saw  a lot of faults in that depa
rtment, but I only mind my  own busin ess, I 
did what I have to do. But 
once I was in charge, I shifted 10 people on the spot. I 
says, I don™t need these 10 people becaus
e this guy could do two jobs. Not to do 
something which is impossible, because wh
at happened there, 
they put a line on, 

and when  the one guy finished faster, he 
was standing around and doing nothing. I 
says, okay, you finish th is and then  you ta
ke the other area. And th ings like this, I 
shifted 10 Œ about 10 people approximately.
 And th en they  saw I was doing so  good 
with this Œ with thing, th
ey had a meeting, the bosses had a meeting between them. 
They said, let™s make him a supervisor. 
Came around ag ain with th e same bosses, 
with the same stories and I to
ld them with the same sto r
ies, but I wasn™t so much 
afraid for the Œ for being the supervisor
 because I had the section head already 

 
Interview with BernardPasternak  
 
October 22, 1997 
 

 
 
79
taking. I took over the job of supervisor on
 the Œ fine, of course, you get a hundred 
people involved. And I was running back  
and forth and try to run the department. 
And I was so success i n  running the depart
ment, that we need more machinery. 
Okay, we need more machiner
y. I get machinery, so th
ere™s a lot of places where 
you buy those machinery, t
hose kind of things. Called me
 in, he says, you going to 
Detroit
 to buy a machine for 
this. I say, where™s 
Detroit
? What 
Detroit
? So he 
explained me, and he says, like I was telling 
you, we get you all the help. You could 
take somebody with  you if you
 want to, and you going to  
Detroit 
to buy the 
machine. I went to 
Detroit
, come back Œ that time, in th
e 50s, we paid almo st a half 
a million dollars for a machine, and I was 
trusted with so much
 money to buy the 
machine. And put out the mach
ine, I set up the machine, put Œ course, I had to learn 
the busin ess, I had to stay in 
Detroit
 for a week, two weeks, 
to learn the bi Œ to 
learn the machine, the new type of m
achines. Put down the 
machine and business 
started booming again, started hiring mo re
 people and kept on going all over the 
country, I went all over the cun Œ 
Minneapolis
, I went all over the country to get 
machines. Matter of fact, there was another 
guy, a boss, he was of German descent, 
and that guy used to  travel
 around too. He went to 
Germany
, he bought a machine. 
He says to me, 
Bernie
, you going to 
Frankfurt
? I says no, I™m not going th ere. I 
said, I don™t want to put my  foot down  there,
 I™m not going there. He says okay, this 

 
Interview with BernardPasternak  
 
October 22, 1997 
 

 
 
80
is part of the business. It™s something yo
u have to do, an d if you won™t do it, then 
we gonna have a problem. So he says, 
take somebody with you. I took so mebody 
with me, I went to Œ to 
F ra n kfurt
, I went to other places around there to buy the 
machine, went back to th
e old places. And when I ste
pped down in the airport, 
Frankfurt am Main
, I saw Nazis over there, you 
know, I see the Œ the picture 
comes back to me. It w as so
 Œ you know, in early 60s, 
it was something, you know, 
it come back to my  mind. So I says to the 
guy, he was an Italian guy, I says to him, 
I say, listen. I don™t want to touch a fra 
Œ a Œ a mark, I don™t want to touch anything 
here. I™m gonna buy something in the store 
which is made in any other country, and 
you handle the whole thing. I do the nego
tiation, and you handle the whole thing. 
So he couldn™t handle it the right way, so I have to step in anyhow, because it would 

be a problem. So after the meeting was th
ere, and we bought the machines, that™s 
already came out for over a million dollar 
machines, came out the machines, so 

finally they said stick Œ there was 
a Belgian guy at one who lived in 
Germany
, so 
he says, okay, we going out to eat in 
F rankfurt
. I says, o k ay, we going out to eat, 
but I want to tell you something. I only ea
t kosher. They  all got stung because I Œ 
they didn™t even know I 
was Jewish. So  the other guy says, I don™t even know 
where they  have kosher places in here. So
 they told the secretary, she kept on 
looking and looking, lo oking. Finally
 they find in  the synagogue in 
Frankfurt
, 

 
Interview with BernardPasternak  
 
October 22, 1997 
 

 
 
81
there was a Hungarian family that immigrat
ed  there, Jewish Hungarian. Matter of 
fact, she was from 
Hungary
, he was from 
Israel
. They opened a kosher place in 
there. So they say, oh, we have a kosher place
 in there. So we were re Œ all went in 
there and eat. Can you imagine that? Maki
ng all those Nazis eat kosher food? And 
when we went in there I said
, that™s not enough, I want to do something else too. I 
say, you want wine? I say yes. Which I 
don™t drink wine, once in a while. Well, 
actually 
[indecipherable]
 So, I says okay. So  they bring out the best wine from 
France
. I said no, no, no, no,
 no. I want wine from 
Israe l
, and I want to see the 
kosher mark on there. So th
ey  brought kosher wine and I had to make all of Nazis 
drink kosher wine too, so I 
should get a little bit revenge 
of them. So we find out the 
deal, we made up the deal, 
everything. Went back a few times there because Œ and I 
went the same thing, the sa
me thing what I said now, I never saw a mark and I 
never touched a mark. And never bought 
an ything except when I bought in the 
stores, I went in Œ I went in with the Am
erican dollar to buy, that time. And then 
came home, we put up all those machines
. And from the hundred people, g-grown 
to 250 people. The business was so boomi
ng, th e whole plant had over a thousand 
people. Business was so booming that we had 
to put in a night shift. So I was in 
charge in day and night on 
the plant and th e machine. Matter of fact, I got up, I 
went as high as I became a 
metallurgent
(p h) engineer. I know metal, I know it 

 
Interview with BernardPasternak  
 
October 22, 1997 
 

 
 
82
anyhow, so I didn™t go to school, but I reco
gnize the metal anyhow
, and I told them 
if it™s stainless steel, if it™s iron, how mu
ch iron is in there. So I became the 
metallurgents
(ph) engineer, and we 
hired people, new people.
 We hired a lot of 
Italian people because I speak the language 
and th ey were very good work ers, so I 
was leaning to the Italian people. And also 
I never forget what th
ey did fo r me when  
they told me
 Avanti
, 
Avanti
. So I never forget, which I ha
ve a soft spot for them. I 
went back a few times to 
Italy
 and I have neighbors Italian,
 I speak to them Italian. 
But there was one time I couldn™t get any wo
rk ers. They  used to ask me, where you 
get those people? Do  you go to  the boat? 
Do  you pick them up there? And so I 
couldn™t get any people, so they were Œ that time Œ 
Puerto Rico
 opened that time, 
and there™s a lot of Puerto Ricans came 
in. And in terviewed them, and of course 
they didn™t speak a word E
ngli Œ interview them. And be
fore they start speaking 
English, I learned Sp an ish, because they 
couldn™t speak the language, so I had to 

learn Spanish in Œ in the job there. So
 I was Œ I had about 
Œ about 250 people, 
maybe mo re, in charge day and night of
 the oldest machinery. And I find I™m 
working over there 37 year in 
one place. I was that time in 
the union, and when they 
make me all those big Œ big Œ make me a
ll those proposal, they says, you have to 
step out of the union, because you cannot 
be in the union and 
you cannot be a boss 
in the side. I came home and I told my wife
, I said this and this happen, I could 

 
Interview with BernardPasternak

83
became the vice-president in charge of manuf
acturing, if Œ but I cannot be in the 
union. She says to me, look
, you stay where you are. You Œ I don™t need a title. 
You™re doing very good th e 
way it is, don™t leave the union. There was a lot of guys 
that left the union, a
nd it™s true, th ey Œ they lost thei
r jobs. And I was protected from 
the union. So I was staying in the union. Th
ey  Œ they  had no choice, and I didn™t 
want to leave, so they le
ft me the way it was, and the exemp Œ exemption to do 
something like this, to work
 for the boss, and to work 
for the union. Then  is Œ the 
plant got bigger and bigger and I retired, and 
they take over the Œ some other people 
took over the plant, and the plan t went 
downhill, it took about 10
 years. I™m retired 
already 10 years, and they 
took over the plant and they
 Œ they Œ th ey brought it 
down  and down  and down. Finally they
 sold it, and Œ and they moved to 
Thailand
, 
the whole comp any moved to 
Thailand
. So they di
ssolved the pi
 Œ dissolved 
everything over here. People 
were coming to me. I had some of the former bosses, 
they begged  me to go and restructure 
the wh ole thing, I mean, but I was not 
interested to go back. I was, but my wi
fe did not want me to go back . Sh e says, 
enough is enough, so th at™s it. 

Q: During your Œ your years 
in this country , work ing and raising a family, a lot of 
changes have happened in this country . I wa
s wondering if you can tell me if any of 
these had any particular 
interest for you. You Œ

84
A: Well Œ 
Q: Œ you were here for the Œ the 
Vietna m
 War and the Co ld War. Did you have any 
concerns about either of those? 
A: When  we had the 
Vietna m
 War that time, we had a union, it was 
UE
 Electrical, 
it was a communist union. And during th e war that time, mo st of the 
[indecipherable]
 went for the Œ for the war, you know all those Œ they went to  the 
war. And there was a lot of Œ of work, like to
 make rock ets, to ma ke other thing fo r 
the war. And we could not ge
t a contract bef Œ because we were a communist union, 
so they co uldn™t give us a contract. What
 we did, we went 
Œ a few people we got 
together and we went down  to 
Ma nh a t ta n
, and we talked to the 
Tea m ster
 union, to 
try to take over, we gonna throw this 
union out. Everything was a secret. And 
finally we suc-succeed, we throw out th
e communist union a
nd we got in the 
Teamster 
union, which it™s up til Œ til the last days til they closed. And we had the 

contract, and we were doing 
very good, and we were lo
oked Œ we looked  up mu ch 
better without that communist union. 

Q: There were also some changes in Civil 
Rights in this country. Did you have any 
thoughts about that as Œ as you saw the changes? 
A: The Civil Right movement was a very
 good movement, not only for Œ for the 
Civil Right thing, it was a good movement
 for Œ for Œ for everybody, for all

minorities, majorities. Everybodybenefit 
from it. We benefit because before, you 
know, they wer Œ you weren™t treated right
. No matter what you did, you weren™t 
treated right because was taken advantage.
 It doesn ™t matter what nationality you 
are. Once the Civil Right start movement, 
it was a little easier 
for everybody, and it 
was a g Œ a good movement with that. 
Q: Also in this country, th
ere was the sexual revolution, which is certainly different 
than the kind of environment you were rais
ed in. Did you have any thoughts on Œ on 
some of those changes? 

A: Now, you talking about equal opportun
ity? Something like th
is? Okay. The thing 
is this; I had a lot of womens working fo
r me, and they  Œ they performed sometimes 
better than the man. And I could not see, 
because you™re a Œ you™re different, you 

know, your sex is different, why couldn™
t you get the job? Because you could 
perform. And I did it, because I got bette
r performance from them, and I™m glad 
they start that because it
™s better fo r the country. 
Q: So anything else that happened in this 
country , in the years that you™re here, that 
was of particular interest to you? 

A: Yeah, the Civil Rights movement is of particular interest. Secular harassment, 
you know, it™s a Œ it™s a go
od movement with Œ also 
job opportunities, business 
opportunity, and a lot of what
ever the change is
, it™s for the bettering, since I came.

United States Holocaust Memorial Museum
 interview with 
Bernard 
Pasternak
. This is tape three, side
 A
. Can you give me a little
 insight into Œ into 
your life overall in this country? 
A: Oh, I married in 1953. That where yo
u Œ that™s where I Œ I always wished I 
should settle down an d start 
living a normal life. Also was looking fo r the right girl, 
which everybody lo oks for the right man or 
the right girl, which I could say I find it. 
We both fit in so much to 
each other like a pot with a 
cover. I was very honest all 
those years, I™m married for so
 many years. I had my  fu n in 
Italy
, so I was very, 
very devoted to the family, and very hone
st with my  wife, on Œ pulling on the same 
track togeth er, we never ste
pped out of line. Once you st

everything. So we ed ucated Œ highly educ
ated our kids. We wo

the hardest way we could, we worked se ven days a week , that she work ed. There 

was a lot of time she brought the kids hom
e Œ when  I brought the kids home from 
school at night Œ all day she was work ing, 
and when  I brought them home at night, I 
took over and sh e went to work. She us

from work. And we had to shar
e whatever we had to do. We
 had to  do th e best thing 
we can. We did when they 
went to the schooling, and we had also, the mo st 
important thing was the friends, with which friend you were going. Sometimes they 

 
Interview with BernardPasternak

88
went out with friends and we didn™t like th
eir friends, because their friends, they left 
the kids with babysitters, it didn™t work out.
 So we didn™t agree with that, and the 
kids, after they finish ed the 
Yeshiv a
 University, they decided 
they want to go to get 
the profession, so decided he
 want to go to law. So 
Jerry 
started out, the first thing 
he said he wants to be a lawyer. So my wi
fe says to him, says look, I will support 
you and your father will supp
ort you all means, all the way. But I want to tell you 
something, you gonna be a lawyer, I don™t want a 
shysie
(ph) lawyer in my family, I 
want the best lawyer there is. If you cannot
 perform as the best lawyer, I don™t want 
a lawyer. But thank God he made it, and my  
wife got her wish, he™s the best lawyer. 

So my  second boy, he came 
around, I ask him, what you 
want to do with your life, 
what you want to do for th e future? So he says, I™m gonna be a Œ a manager, some 

kind, industrial managing, things like that. 
I says to him, look, there are so many 
thing Œ so many people doing that kind of 
job, and I don™t thi
nk th at™s gonna be 
some kind of a future. But if you want it, I™ll 
[indecipherable]
. So then I find out he 
is interested to go in law.
 So he went into law too. 
And of course my third one 
followed the same step . What I could tell y
ou one thing, that I 
am v ery happy with 
their profession, and they™re very establis
hed in the Œ in th eir way. By  my  Œ by 
Jerry
 I have two gran dchildren, and they™re
 wonderful children.
 And my younger 
boy, he Œ he live Œ

who married befo re my  middle boy, he lives in 
Living ston
,
 New Jersey
. He has a Œ 
Jerry 
has a boy and a girl, and my  younger boy
 Stev en
, he has two girls. One girl is 
n amed  after my  mo th er an d  my  sister, th
e one I was telling you she died in th e 
camp, 
Hannah
(ph) 
Esther
. My other granddaughter is
 named through my wife 
family. And I wanted to have a name for my
 father so bad, so my younger son, he 
gave me the whole name, and I called him 
Moishe Ze v
. He doesn™t even have an 
English name, just 
Moishie
(ph). That™s the way they call 
him. He™s also very Œ he 
succeeds very much in his 
[indecipherable]
 in his Œ my younger
 one, he opened his 
own practice and 
[indecipherable]
 in a law firm. And my  middle boy, we Œ he just 
got married in November. He was waiting t
oo long, he couldn™t find what he wants 
to here. So finally he fi
nds somebody, find a wonde
rful girl, and he married 
Novemb er 1996. And my  Œ he Œ of course, 
no grandchildren over there yet. He is 
doing very good doing the job 
in Œ in the law firm. They
 are very well established 
themself, and th ank God, they  don™t need
 any help from nobody, because they™re 
doing in  their own. And I could say that I 
mad e it, wh at my  aim wa s, my  d ream, 
everything came true the way. Of course, 
like I said, if y ou married, and you start 
pulling different direction, you
 never make it. Once you st
ay together and you work 
out your problems together, you make it.
 I g ive you an example for myself.  
Q: What™s your reaction to this resurg
ence of interest 
in the Holocaust? 

 
Interview with BernardPasternak  
 
October 22, 1997

A: This is one of the greatest thing th
e younger generation are doing. I am amazed 
to see some people are pu tting in their life. Like 
Esther Finder
 who™s interview 
me, she™s p u tting in her life in
 that Holocaust thing. And 
that™s all Œ whenever we 
get togeth er, we ask about family first, th
e second wo rd is about the Holo caust. And 
I™m delighted. Also, she had a daughter Œ sh
e has a daughter, she got Œ she wa Œ got 
Bat Mitzvah. And we just saw the tape, a
nd sh e made a speech, also mentioned the 

Holo caust. I tell you, even fo r so many years,
 we both Œ my  wife was here too, we 
both start crying, you know, to see. That™s 
the third generation. So it™s one of the 
greatest thing people could do, to keep 
on passing from one generation to  the other 
one. And 
Esther Finder
 is a very good example, what she™s doing. 
Q: Thank you. How do you respond wh
en you hear Holocaust deniers? 

A: Holo caust? 

Q: Deniers. 

A: Oh, well, you know, you 
could Œ have to take thos
e people serious, but they 
don™t know what they™re talking about a
nyhow. It makes no sense whatsoever. But 
you have to put a stop to it because some
body else may believe 
something like this, 
and you have to prove that th
at™s why it™s so important to
 search the Holocaust, to 
open mo re mu seum, to open mo re things, to
 talk mo re about it and especially in 

 
Interview with BernardPasternak

91
school for the younger children, and not to
 let go. Just keep  on reminding people 
what happened, because if you do th
at, it™ll never gonna happen again. 
Q: Do you think the Jews in
 this country have reason to
 fear from skinheads or neo-
Nazis? 
A: That™s the way it starts. That™s the way it 
start, this anti-Semitic
 thing, that™s why 
you have to put a Œ you have
 to put a stop right on the spot. Matter of fact, I just 
heard from Jewish 
[indecipherable]
 that there is some k ind of inte-internet, they 
start sending anti-Semitic things from the in
ternet, one to the other one. All those 
things gotta be stop. Soon so mething starts
, you st Œ you have to stop it right away. 

You don™t let go, nothing. Take it serious. 
Q: How has your Holocaust experience in
fluenced the choices that you made over 
the years? 
A: Well, we were Œ you see, we Œ we were
 born in the place, soon you were born, 
you are independent, because there were 
so many children over there, you couldn™t 
take care of them. So you had to  be indepe
ndent in Œ in general. But once you went 
through this Holocaust life, you know, you
r experience was entirely different. You 
Œ you devoted mo re, because you see the 
tsoris 
you could get in if you do 
something in  Œ and th e wrong th ing. So  it Œ 
it influence a lot, and in th e other way, 

it™s Œ it™s something which I don™t feel ve
ry well now, you know, you remember all 

 
Interview with BernardPasternak  
 
October 22, 1997 
 

 
 
92
those thing, it™s tough, cramming you all the 
corners, you see all those thing. So  I™m 
glad the way it turned out
 now, that I™m happy. 
Q: In wh at ways has your view of Juda ism been changed by the Holo caust? Are you 
a believer? 
A: That™s a very hard  question to answ
er. I am a believer, but not the way they 
believing now, in that the 
ultra-Orthodox, like forcing ch
ildren to accept something 
which they don™t want to accep
t. I believe you, in Judais
m, to God and to people. 
You have to be for both. You don™t have
 separate from the other, from anybody 
else, just to be a Jew. You could be a g
ood Jew, and Œ and Œ and do what you have 
to do not to be separated, that Œ dr
ess differen t, go diffe
rent, do other thing 
different. I™ll tell you, that caused a lot of
 anti-Semitic thing too, because the way 
you separating with the thi
ng. You could keep up your 
faith very well, like I d o  
now, for both ways, to people, and to God. 

Q: When  you lo ok back at yourself as
 a parent, what influence did your war 
experience have on th e way th
at you raised your sons? 
A: See, the thing was this, wh
en  you Œ wh en you 
had your parents Œ 
first of all, you 
lost them very young, and th e seco nd thing, it was a di fferent influence what they 

tried to do, it Œ with Œ with Œ first of a
ll, what they Œ th e parents those days was 
worried how to feed their 
children, which cause there 
was no food. Who to give

93
first? And it™s a very interested thing, 
it was not in our house, but most of the 
houses I saw, when  they had a little food, 
who™d th ey give first? For the father. He 

was the head of the comm Œ on Œ on th e he-hea
d of the house. Everything the father 
for, the Œ the kid could have suffered from hunge
r or diseases, first they take care in 
the father, and that was 
the wrong thing to do.  
Q: In retrospect, would you have done a
nything differently raising your sons? If you 
di Œ di Œ if you could do it again toda
y, would you do it differently at all? 
A: I tell you, if I would have listen to my  
wife, probably that we would never be in 
so much education, so ma
ny Jewish thing, because my  wife was very highly 
educated. Even she was young,
 she was the best in school. And I saw so many good 
things on her that she could do, and I left 
her do whatever she had to do, and she did 
the right thing, and I™m so delighted
 to see this thing what happened. 
Q: Do you speak with your
 sons about your past? Abou
t, you know, the Holo caust 
now? 

A: Well, whenev er we get together, you 
know, they live one 
apart, one from the 
other one, but if my  middle son, which is 
Alvin
, he doesn™t live too far from me, it™s 
about 20 minutes or so. But how could 
you speak, they work
ing so  hard. They 
working from early in the morn
ing to early Œ late at night. But when there is a 

 
Interview with BernardPasternak  
 
October 22, 1997 
 

 
 
94
vacation, we talk about it, because they
 all belong to th e mu seum, they all 
supporting the 
Yad Vashem
, so they all involved in different ways. 
Q: Some of your gran dchildren are old enou
gh now to Œ to talk
 to about some of 
your experiences. Do you talk to  them 
about your childhood
, or your wartime 
experiences? 
A: Well, we do Œ I did explai
n to my  older grandchildren what happened with  the 

schooling, with all this thi
ng. So th e Œ the thing was, it 
was a different world, and it 
will never happen, this kind of world any mo
re, so we have to do the best we can 
now.  

Q: Did th ey ask you about the war? 
A: All they did was certain Œ there was 
some times Œ they kept on questioning me 
why the Œ we have no gran
dparents, you know, even  now, and what happened, 
where I was, especially my 
Auschwitz
 number is very visible, it™s very big letters. 
So sometimes they come over and kiss my  arm,
 things like this. So they feel very st 
Œ very  bad what happened with me and why I lost the whole family. 

Q: Is there anything that you would like y
our older, the older grandchildren to  ask 
you, that they haven™t? 
A: I want them Œ they Œ they are Œ they
 are Œ they are very  busy with schooling 
now, but like it was mentioned before, I want
 them to get more 
involved in Œ in 

 
Interview with BernardPasternak  
 
October 22, 1997 
 

 
 
95
third generation Holocaust things with th
e museum, with all the other thing. But 
probably they were left Œ 
they™re gonna have 
a little free time. So we get together 
quite often, so Œ 
Q: Do you speak publicly 
about your experien ces? 
A: Yes, I do speak. Matter of fact, I went to an affair and those people were not 
Holocaust survivor, and it Œ it Œ it™s someth
ing, you know, wher
e you get togeth er 
with people, Holocaust survivor, after 
you talk a little bit, the Holo caust thing 
comes up. So I was Œ we were talking abou
t something, and this person comes over, 
they says, we don™t talk abou t Holocaust here, we having a 
simcha
 over here, we 
don™t Œ I don™t want to hear anything ab ou
t it. There is some people like that, they 
don™t want to hear wh at happe
ned, they™re not interested.  
Q: You™ve mentioned several times that 
you™ve had recurring dreams since the war, 

and you Œ you wake
 up to see if you are, in fact, 
free. Can you Œ can you sh are with 
me a little bit about some of
 those recurring nightmares? 
A: Well, the thing of it is, what you see,
 and Œ and wh at happened before, it™s Œ i-i-
it™s so muc h  different than 
one with the other thing. We
 never thought we gonna be 
free, because we know we gonna be killed, or
 Œ or Œ or get killed. So either way, we 
didn™t have any hope to be 
Œ to Œ to live. And Œ and that
™s thing is still in our mind, 
that we never gonna be free. I go up a lo
t of time at night and I look out of the 

 
Interview with BernardPasternak  
 
October 22, 1997 
 

 
 
96
window and take a look where I am, how 
I am, and a lot of time when I go up, I 
could bang in the Œ it happened one time 
I broke the glass from the Œ from the Œ 
from the window, because I went out ther
e and I knocked on the glass because I 
wanted to  look outside, and it was dark, an
d I didn™t see, and 
break th e window to 
see if I™m really free, b
ecause it just an unbelievable thing that I am free. 
Q: I wanted you to Œ to back up for ju
st a minute and Œ and 
tell me, during your 
time Œ after the war, but before you came to the 
United States
, in those years, did 
you follow the 
Nuremberg
 trials? 
A: If I follow the Œ 

Q: 
Nuremberg
 trials. 
A: Not too mu ch, because I didn™t know wh
o they trying. Becaus
e we had no Œ we 
didn™t read no newspapers, 
and we didn™t Œ we Œ we couldn™t read because there 
was not the papers we know 
how to read. So I just saw 
[indeciphera ble]
 what™s 
going on, and th en I find out about the bi
g guys. The only trial I was follow very 
close is 
Eichmann™s
 because he was involved with 
[indecipherable]
 the Hungarian 
Jew. And I was following very good, ev en th
ey had a movie about it, so I was very 

much interested to see what
 happened, because a lot of 
thing I did not know what 
this guy did. So I followed 
that thing close, which I know
 what the other things, the 
other one, I just h
eard about the names. 

 
Interview with BernardPasternak

Q: Did you think ju stice was done? 
A: Yeah, justice was done, but the prob
lem was, why was he caught so late? 
Q: Did you follow the news
 on the partition vote for 
Palestine
 and the birth of the 
state of 
Isr a el
? 

A: Yes, I followed it. So we all followed it when I was in 
Austria
 and 
Reiden burg
, 
Salzburg
, we did fo llow th e whole thing, and du
e to the fact I am and I was and I™m 
gonna be forever a real Zionist, and it inte
rested me very much
, every corner. They 
also had a lot of film, like Œ they had one film like ﬁ
Hill 24Doesn™t Answer
.ﬂ So I 
was watching th at movie a few time, matter of
 fact, I didn™t even go out to see. And 
I Œ when I was with family there in 
Israel
, they show me around the area, I ask 
them where the fights was. 
I also, when we went for 
Tel Aviv
 with family to 
Jerusalem
, th ey  
[indecipherable]
 back and forth and they 
show me all the places 
where the Jordan ian used to hide. And they
 shu Œ shoot down  the thing. So  I know 
Israel
 very well, and I know every corner be
cause I been there at least 20 times. So 
we go very often ther
e and Œ and our hearts, me and my  wife is 
Israel
 and 
Israel
 
again. And it™s one of the greatest things
 because I think Jewish people will never 
exist in this country without 
Israel
 and 
Israel 
will never exist without the American 
Jewish. So it™s some thing 
like one people, and we ha
ve to stick it together, 
otherwise we will never survive.

Q: What has been the Œ either
 the best surprise, or the biggest disappointment that 
you had in this country? 
A: Well, dis-dis-disappointment is when I 
came to this country, an d it wasn™t so 
rosy in th e beginning and it was a very 
hard life to start,
 you know, without 
speaking the language. It Œ it Œ it was a terribl
e thing, wh ich I kept on saying I want 
to go back to 
Italy
. I speak the language there and I had a job with  the government, 
Italian government. And th ere was a disappoi
nting Œ soon I walked  down  the boat, I 
was disappointed in  my  aunt, she didn™t
 tell us the true, I would have be in 
Israel
 
now, where I belong; in the army somepl
ace, being a general, who knows? And so 
it didn™t work out with that, 
was a very big disappointment
. What I am very surprise 
and very happy, I could te
ll you I succeeded. In this 
country I did made it, in 
general, for one reason; because we pulled 
in the same directi
on with my wife. We 
married from 1953, and now is 1997. And 
of course everybody has a little quarrel 
back and forth, and I always back  up, beca
use I know she™s right. So I always have 
the last word, I say, okay, what do you 
want me to do? But she™s a great lady in 
general, and also she don™t 
feel too good now, she has Œ 
arthritis developed in the Œ 
in the camps. She doesn™t feel good, a lot 
of problems she has, and she™s talking to 
me, she says, you got Œ now you Œ look wh
at you Œ you have 
yourself now, look 
what a wife you have. I can™t help you 
too much, I can™t do too mu ch  because I 

 
Interview with BernardPasternak

99
don™t feel good. My  only reply was, I 
don™t see you the way you lo ok now, I only 
see you th e way I met you, and to my  ey
es is the way I know you and the way 
you™re gonna stay. So you kn
ow what she said to me? 
Why don™t you get Œ change 
your glasses? That was the reply.
 Which I wear no glasses anyhow. 
Q: What would you ye
t like to accomplish? 
A: I Œ what I like to accomplish, I™m acco
mp lishing. Trav eling from one son to the 
other one, going to  
Israel
 and make sure my wife feels good, make sure I could do 
everything to help her, because bothers her, 
a lot of thing. And wh atever I do now, 
I™m very happy in general, and my  happie
st Œ second happiest thing is Œ was the 
grandchildren, the family, and then  wh en we go to  
Israel
. Like I said, we go every 

year, and we see so many friends over there.
 And I™m just delighted to see the way 
the country is growing and Œ and they ca
nnot say now like they used to say, in 
Romania
 used to say, hey Jew, go to 
Palestine
; hey Jew, you don™t belong here. 
Now we are there where we belong. 
Q: What would you like your sons and Œ 
and grandchildren to know about you that 
they perh aps don™t know about you? 
A: Well, I only want them to
 know the way we are and I don™t want them to think 
that I came from the big family, you know, ve
ry important people. I came from a Œ 
from where I came. Came from a Œ we we
re very poor, it was a very poor place 

 
Interview with BernardPasternak  
 
October 22, 1997 
 

 
 
100
from where I came, I want them to know 
that. I also want them to know the 
hardship I went through, and I want them 
to know that my success, they should take 
a example from me, why Œ why you su ccess 
in life. And you stick Œ when  you want 
to do something you stick to 
it, and help each other and I want to see close family, 
like I am with my  sister and my  brother now
. To me the Œ this is the most important 
thing, cousins, whatever it is
, just stay close, get in contact with each other, call 
each other. And that makes my life. 
Q: I wanted to ask you about a book that r
ecently came to our atte
ntion, both of us. 
The book is entitled, ﬁ
Prisoner 83571
.ﬂ Can you tell me a little bit about this book, 
and what it has meant to you? 

A: This book, what you just mentioned, it™
s very, very interested to me. Why? He™s 
telling the story exactly what 
happened. And it Œ very intere
sted that this man went 
through the same thing that I 
went through, and by reading 
all this thing of what he 
went through, I remember a lot of things. On
e thing, I was working in  a Œ in a Œ in a 
mine on Œ on a stone mine, we were workin
g in the mountains there, and I didn™t 
know what the heck they we
re doing there, the German. 
In the book I see they were 
trying missiles there. The German
 were trying the missile, the 
V-2
, whatever they 
make. And there was other thing. A lot of 
marsh Œ marches we went, and we didn™t 
have any direction. So he 
says in the book, we Œ we marched a death march to 

 
Interview with BernardPasternak  
 
October 22, 1997 
 

 
 
101
nowhere. I didn™t know 
[indecipherable]
 we were going there. And there was a lot 
of areas I didn™t know the distance from one 
place to the other one, he™s telling me 
where. It™s something I keep 
on reading and reading, keep
 on remi nding. It™s one of 
the greatest book a man could ever write, 
esp ecially the Œ the 
thing which I went 
through. 

Q: Are you saying that you were in th
e same camp as this Œ this author? 
A: Yes, I was in the same 
camp  from the beginning. First 
of all, he™s starting up 
with his life in 
Poland
 someplace where he was before they send him to 
Auschwitz
. And from there where he picks up the 
Auschwitz
 til the liberation, it Œ
it™s exactly what I went through, because
 he was in the same camp. And it™s Œ it 
reminds me the thing, a lot of thing, 
which I couldn™t remember. Like I was 
work ing wh en they  had that mine work ing in
 there, in the mountains in there. And I 
was working for somebody ther
e, for a German guy, a ci
vilian guy, I didn™t know 
his name. He puts it down in th e book, wh
at the guy™s name was and it was very 
interesting to me to see it, which I have a copy and I treasure it very mu ch. 

Q: Is there anything you™d like to add? So
mething that perhaps we
 didn™t cover, that 
you would like to include
 before we finish? 
A: Well, it was very hard for me to give 
this interview, because it takes me back, 
way back what happen
ed. It™s not gonna be easy for me
 to forget all those thing, 

 
Interview with BernardPasternak  
 
October 22, 1997 
 

 
 
102
because sometime it takes months to get ove
r this thing, because
 it brings you back 
a lot of me mo ries, which Œ wh at happened, 
and you get so confus
ed now, after you 
finish. There™s a lot of thing 
I really forgot. I didn™t cove
r everything what I wanted 
to say, because there™s a lot 
of thing I forgot. So whatev
er I remembered, I said it, 
and I hope this thing will go out to schools 
and to other places. They should hear 
what happened, and they learn from it. A
nd maybe if there is any problem like the 
skinheads or the other thing, then thos
e kids will say no, no, I heard it from a 
survivor and I don™t believe what you say,
 because it™s n o t so, it™s Œ it™s really the 
truth that the Holocaust existe
d, which we all know that.  
Q: I want to thank you very
 much for doing the intervie
w with me today, and this 
concludes the interview.
