EDGAR KRASA 
 September 9, 2003 
 
Q: Good morning, Mr. Krasa.  
  

A: Good morning to you. 

  

Q: May I call you Edgar? 

  

A: Yeah,sure. 

  

Q: Yes?  What -- what name  were you born with?   

  

A: Edgar. And I always wondered where my 
Ger man speaking mother came up with Edgar. 
And she said it was between Raoul and Edgar, so I said, ﬁI™m glad you picked Edgar.ﬂ 
  

Q: And your last name? 

  

A: Krasa,K-r-a-s-a. 

  

Q: Right. And where and when were you born? 

  

A: I was born in the German part of Czechos
lovakia, in Karlsbad, call it Sudeten, too. And 
my upbringing while we were there was in 
German language. Grade school started in 
German, and there was never any animosity am
ong -- that I felt -- be
tween the Czech and 
the German population, and these we re Germ
an Nationalists, but Czech citizens, 
Czechoslovakian citizens. And there was no 
friction between the Germans and the Jews 
until I think in 1930, when Hitler 
came  to power , he started to
 dema nd of the leaders of 
that German Nationals -- of those German Nationals, to start to agitate, and complain 

about oppression by the Czechoslovakian governme nt, and it -- and dema nd to be 

annexed by the Nazis. And by 1933, it -- three ye
ars later, it came  to the point where my 
father as a Jew couldn™t ma ke a living among 
those Germans. And he mo ved to Prague. 
  

Q: Can I -- can I go back, so we can go just a little bit more slowly? 

  

A: Yeah. 

  

Q: What was the date of your birth? 

  

A: February ninth, 1924. 

  

Q: 1924. 

  
A: Yeah. 
  

Q: Okay. And do you reme mber growing up 
-- you -- you moved to Prague in 1933 --

A: Yeah. 

  

Q: Is that right? So do you reme mber growing up between 1924 and 1933 in -- 

  

A: I do reme mb er. 

  

Q: -- in Karlsbad? 

  

A: My father was born 1877, one of nine childre
n, the oldest of nine children, six boys, three 
girls. And I am so sorry that I never -- I di
dn™t know his parents. 
But I never initiated 
questions about them, and he -- neither did 
he. So I don™t know what -- we found out in 
the archives that hi s father was a -- had a 
small store in a -- in a very small town in 
central Bohemi a. And -- so at 
age 16, he went to Vienna, to be able to earn some  money, 
and he worked himself up to a treme ndous posi
tion in a textile factory, to the point where 
he supported his brothers to go to school, and ac
cumulate a dowry for his three sisters. So 
in World War I, he must have been acknowledged by the military as a good 

admi nistrator, so he became admi nistrator of
 a hospital in Karl sba
d. And there he then 
later settled. My mother, you didn™t ask 
about her, but I™ll tell you anyway. 
  

Q: I was going to. 

  

A: She was born in -- in the German part of
 Czechoslovakia, and sh -- that family was 
religious. Not fanatically, but Saturday was no 
work, I couldn™t go to the barber, have my 
hair cut on Saturday. I don™t remembe r , I -- th
ey must have been kosher, but the father™s 
side, the Czech Jews, they were very assimilated. They were aware of being Jewish, and 
if they weren™t aware th -- of
, this would have made them aware. But the Czech -- Czechs 
were not antisimi c -- not aggressi vely anti-S
emitic. I think they handled the Jews in a 
way that they didn™t know what they are, andhow different they are from them, and kept 
them a little at arm™ s length. And some  would be very nice to you, and then when you 

turned your back they would say, there goes 
the dirty Jew. This kind of hidden anti-

Semitism. But I never --  I never suffered by it. 
  

Q: Your mother was considerably youn
ger than your father, am I right? 
  

A: 18 years younger, and how they me t was that she was a born ma tchmaker, and she 
wanted him -- I don™t know where she me t hi m,
 s he wanted him for a friend of hers. And 
we met that fr iend later, and 
we discovered why he didn™t ma
rry her, she was very dull. 
And some how -- he ma y have been attracte
d by a younger woma n. I a m too, but it™s too 
late for me . And so they got ma rried, and se
ttled in Karlsbad. Bu
t what happened with 
this excellent job that my  father had in Vi
enna, he saved a lot of
 money, which he lost 
when Austria lost the war. The money b
ecame devalued, and some how he could not 
recover from that. He -- 
  

Q: You mean psychologically he c
ould not recover? [indecipherable]

A: I don™t know what it was, but -- it™s not nice to
 talk about your father this way, but this is 
a ma tter of fact. He continued to live in th
e way he lived while he had the money, to I 
think show in front of other people that he is
 -- is still up there. But he was very, very 
lower mi ddle class I think I woul
d say, to the point where Moth
er had to sublet rooms to 
earn some  extra income . And then in 1933 we m
oved to Prague. He went first to look for 
a [indecipherable] for a jo -- for an apartment,
 for a job, and then in October, we moved 
to Prague. 
  
Q: Wh- What was your relationship like with
 your parents?  We re you close with them? 
  

A: Relationship was very good. I -- I started 
my me moirs by writing, I want this -- I™m 
writing this for my kids, not for -- for publishi
ng, and thinking back
 of the relationship 
my parents, from what I heard, had with thei
r parents, and what my parents had with me , 
and the relationship, and how I was bringing 
up my kids, and how they bringing up their 

kids, should they laugh, or shoul
d I cry?  It was -- it was a re
spectful relationship. Mother 
was the boss. She was running the family and everybody else. And -- and she come  and I 

wasn™t there that mi nute, I had one comi ng like this. 
  

Q: She hit you, really? 

  

A: And the second time I was there when she calle
d. I know my sons call 
their kids 10 time s, 
come, come, come. Then they give up and th
e kids don™t come . I f my
 wife is listening, 
she™s going to kill me for this st atement. So
 -- and I discussed this with one of our 

daughters-in-law, and she says, ﬁYou cannot
 touch the kids, because they become 

abusive parents themselves.ﬂ 
I didn™t become abusive, a
nd I didn™t become abusive to 
anybody else, and I still loved my mother, and 
respected her. And I 
thinkit made me a -- 
a straight guy. 
  

Q: Was she warm as we -- I mean, she could be
 strict, clearly, but was she also warm to 
you? 
  

A: She was warm and witty, and -- and ha d ma ny fr iends, and was liked by others. 

  

Q: So you liked her, also? 

  

A: Yes,yeah. 

  

Q: And was your father, being so much older, was -- was -- 

  

A: We had very little -- very little activities t
ogether. He went to wor
k, and in the afternoon 
he -- some of the people sat somewhere playi
ng cards, he never did 
this. Me, what I did 
with my kids, skiing, swimmi ng, running, spor
ts, o-or other activities. He was 45 when 
he got ma rried, and 47 when I was born, and 
at that time , 47, you were a settled person. 
  

Q: Did you eat dinners together? 

  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
4 
 
 
A: Pardon? 
  

Q: Did you eat dinner together -- 

  

A: Yeah,yeah. 

  

Q: -- did you eat all your meals together? 

  

A: Yes,yes. 

  

Q: And you we re an only child? 

  

A: Only child. That™s why I™m so spoiled.  

  

Q: And did you have conversati
ons at dinner, do you reme mber
?  As a little kid?  Did they 
ask you questions, and -- about
 school, and your friends? 
  

A: In -- opposite what™s happening in England, 
we were not allowed to talk with a full 
mouth. So while you were eating, and you had th
e full mouth all the time , there was no 
conversation at the table. 
  

Q: Interesting. So it was very quiet. 

  

A: Yeah. But I -- I did not have ma ny toys. I 
had one -- what do you ca
ll this horse? Rocking 
horse -- 
  
Q: Rocking hor -- 
  

A: -- which also could -- you could take off this
 rocking part and then it was on wheels. And 
we lived on a street that ha
d a slope, we -- I took the horse
 up, and -- and rolled down. 
And I reme mber at one point one
 of the children wanted to 
have it, I don™t know for what 
reason I wouldn™t give it to him, my  mother
 locked me up in th
e bathroom the whole 
afternoon as punishme nt because I was not ge
nerous enough. And when she had to go to 

the bathroom, she went to the neighbor™s 
bathroom. Very stri ct, but still lovable. 
  

Q: Right. 

  

A: Andloving. 

  

Q: Did you -- did you understand when you were
 young, before you left for Prague, that 
your f -- your father -- you really
 didn™t have a lot of money, 
but he was trying to behave 
as if he had money?  I mean, did you unde
rstand that there wa s a f -- confusion? 
  

A: No. I found it out later from Mother. 

  

Q: Uh-huh. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
5 
 
 
  
A: N-yeah. 

  

Q: So did you have a ma id? 

  

A: We had a maid in the beginning, I reme mber, 
and that also had to 
-- that belonged to the 
status. We  had to have one, and I reme mber one summer, she went home , her father 

picked her up with a horse 
drawn carriage and I went with
 them to spend some  ti me  
there, but I don™t know how l
ong. It was a short -- and v
acations, while we lived in 
Karlsbad, I spend with Mother™s fami ly in --
 nearby, it was 60 kilome ters from Karlsbad. 
Her father had a liquor production, which he
r older brother took over, but her older 
brother was only a half brother from his -- fr
om her father™s first wife, who died. And 
then he remarried, and through the s
econd wife he had four daughters.  
  

Q: Hm.  

  

A: And one was a divorced lady, so she can co 
-- she ma intained the household for the older 
brother, whose wife died on diabetes. I re
me mber her, she was a wonderful wife, but 

when I reme mber now what diet she kept, I 
don™t wonder that she died early. I had only 
one grandmother, of Mother™s -- from Mother™s
 side, the father died
 already and she died 
when I was three years. And the only thing 
I reme mber, she always wore an apron. And 
the only se ntence I reme mber that she said --
 that I reme mber, was to my mother, ﬁDon™t 

beat the boy, he™s such a wonderful child.ﬂ 
So that means she started to punish me  
already before I was three years old. She 
d -- do it to ma ke a good guy out of -- or a 
decent person out of me, I don™t know, that was the method, maybe. 
  
Q: Do you remem -- do you reme mber being hit a lot? 
  

A: Not a lot, no, not a lot, 
but I had to obey on the second. 
  

Q: And ma inly she woul
d slap you in the face? 
  

A: Yeah,yeah. 

  

Q: Okay. 

  

A: And the only time Father was hitting me  was 
when I was writing, he 
insisted on beautiful 
handwriting. He had two fingers on the right hand 
injured -- cut off, and in spite of it, his 
handwriting was like printing. And he didn™t 
know that there will be typewriters, and 
dictating machines, and computers, so not 
only should I have a legibl e handwriting, but 
he said this is a show of character. 
So that was the thinki ng at that time. 
  

Q: So how -- so how™s your 
handwriting now, is it good? 

  

A: Ah, ah, I can™t -- I can™
t consider right now -- I -- 
I print well, I write legibly. 
  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
6 
 
 
Q: Uh-huh. 
  

A: Even my wife will disput e it, but I wr it
e legi bly, but I don™t -- I don™t need it much. 
  

Q: Right, right. Was it a surprise to you 
that you were going to move to Prague?   
  

A: No, no, I understood that among the Germans 
the -- the political 
situation is not good, 
and that -- whether I knew it, it™s because of fi
nancial, or economi c reasons, or whether it 
is for political, I coul dn™t say now exactly 
what I knew, that we™re moving because the 
Germans we re not very good to the Jews. 
  

Q: And it was assumed that in
 Prague it would be better? 
  

A: Yeah. 

  

Q: And so you were 11 years old when you moved in 1933? 

  

A: Yeah. 

  

Q: Was it diffi cult to adjust? 

  

A: ™33 I was nine years old. 

  

Q: Nine, you™re right, you™r
e right, it™s nine -- 
  

A: That™s -- just figured it out -- 
  
Q: -- 1924 -- 

  

A: Yeah. 

  

Q: -- yeah, no you™re right, I was moving in 
some  other direction. Was it difficult for you, 
was the move difficult? 
  

A: No. We  moved in October a
nd didn™t -- from Se ptember one, I went in Ka rlsbad, to a 
Czech school. That was only -- is about 
six weeks, but I learne d some  Czech. 
  

Q: Uh-huh. 

  

A: And when I came to Prague, I adjusted. 

  

Q: Pretty good, huh? 

  

A: Yeah, I -- it was one talent I had 
was picking up language
s just by hearing. 
  

Q: Really? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
7 
 
 
  
A: But German and Czech are the only 
two language s I learned for mally -- 
  

Q: Uh-huh.Right. 

  

A: -- in schools, gramma r, a nd -- 

  

Q: Did you like school? 

  

A: Yeah. 

  

Q: Did you have favorite subjects in school? 

  

A: That I don™t reme mber. Favorite subjects,
 I was good at arithme tics, and -- and gym. 
  

Q: And gym, yes. 

  

A: But -- but I don™t -- no, I couldn™t tell you 
exactly that I liked 
any s -- any -- we had 
music, which meant singing 
the -- the how is it called? 
House -- house -- home -- home 
teacher. Home  class, or whatever they call it now. The -- the ma in teacher, our -- for this 

particular class. We  also -- 
  

Q: Oh, you me an a homeroom teacher. 

  

A: Ho-Homeroom, thank you. 

  
Q: Yeah. 
  

A: Home room teacher. And he went with us, he
 progressed with us, he didn™t stay in one -- 
at one grade. He was very nice, and he played
 the violin, and with 
him we  had the song. I 
don™t know how ma ny hours a week, 
but there were hours of -- 
  

Q: So you were taught singing?  Or wa
s this -- all students were taught? 
  

A: This -- it -- not from -- not 
-- we weren™t reading music -- 
  

Q: Uh-huh. 

  

A: -- we were just learning it fr
om his -- following his violin. 

  

Q: And what kind of music were you 
singing, folk songs, or Czech -- 
  

A: No, I think Czech -- Czech -- popular Czech songs. 

  

Q: Uh-huh. So did you learn anyt
hing about classical music? 

  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
8 
 
 
A: No,no. 
  

Q: No. And did you go -- there must have been 
concerts, and theater, and opera in Prague. 

  

A: That was later. 

  

Q: That was later. 

  

A: That -- that was later on, yeah. We went to
 the theater  and operas for one Czech choral 
[indecipherable] or whatever it was called. 
We ™re standing in the National Theater, on the 
fourth balcony up, standing. 
  

Q: Yes? 

  

A: A-And it looked so huge. And I don™t know, in
 ™94 -- 1994 or ‚95, we went there again, 
and we were -- could afford the orchestra seat
, and it looks like it coul d reach to the last 
row, it was so small, it was just very high. 
  

Q: Small -- that™s interesting. 

  

A: So all these perspectives
 have changed since childhood. 
  

Q: Right. Now you were Bar-Mitzvah™d. 

  

A: Pardon? 

  
Q: You were Bar-Mitzvah™d in Prague -- 
  

A: Yes. 

  

Q: -- am I right?  So that must have been 1935. 

  

A: Mother was dragging us -- I 
don™t know whether every Frid
ay, but definitely Saturday, 
Father and me  to the synagogue. And seemed like an awful long morning, you know?  

And interesting that during Yizkor, the prayer
s for the deceased, the kids were sent out, 
cause they didn™t have anybody deceased there, 
I think. So we were 
playing outside, there 
was a -- a little wooded lawn area in front of
 the synagogue, and we were sent out, it was 
a break. But I never became  very religious. I -- 
there is a feeling of 
God that she instilled 
in me , and when we get later to these various 
stages of the Holocaust , it varied in several 
degrees. 
  

Q: But you said your mother dragged 
you and your father to the synagogue. 
  

A: Not dragged, she didn™t drag, she sai
d, ﬁ We are going to the synagogue.ﬂ And nobody 
opposed her, you know? 
  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478

Q: I see. But is it -- it isn™
t some thing that necessarily you 
would have done on your own, or 
do you think you mi ght have? 
  
A: I -- I don™t think I initiated the --
 or had the desire to initiate -- 
  

Q: Right. 

  

A: -- to go to -- to synagogue, or -- I like th
e -- I liked Purim because they were throwing 
candies to the kids, and like -- but 
I was not especially enthusiastic. 
  

Q: And who trained you for the Bar-Mitzvah, do you reme mber ? 

  

A: Yes, I remember him, a nd I reme mb er his daugh
ter, the --  the Cantor 
in our shule, I went 
to his house, and he taught me , and later on 
we were very close 
with his daughter in 
Israel . 
  

Q: And did -- 

  

A: Shapiro was his name . 

  

Q: Shapiro, Cantor Shapiro. 

  

A: And I -- and I don™t have a good me mory for name s. I never forget a good looking face, 
especially on a woma n, but the name s I do forget. 
  

Q: And did you enjoy being trained by him?  Wa s th
is some thing that was interesting to you? 
  

A: You™re asking difficult questions. I don™t know
 well -- whether I enj
oyed it. I know I had 
to go, so I we nt.  
  

Q: So you went. 

  

A: But it was not, I think a favorite acti
vity that I would had sought on my own. 
  

Q: Do you remember the service?  

  

A: Yes, it was -- was very good, but I don™t reme mbe r  -- 

  

Q: You reme mber your haft orah? 

  

A: No. 

  

Q: No. 

  

A: But I don™t reme mber whether and where and 
if there was a -- something like a party or 
so. I -- no, there were no parties, there we
re family me mbers and friends were comi ng, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
10 
 
 
and I think it was in my mother™s house, 
some  cake she baked, and coffee she ma de, and 
that could have been it. And funny, much late
r in -- about five, six years ago, I found out 
-- you must have heard of Arnost Lustig? 
  
Q: Mm-h m.  

  

A: Living in Washington. He  went to the same  school, I think two grades lower, and their 
economic situation was very similar to ours. 
And he told me, I never knew that, that my 

mother gave him my Bar-Mitzvah su
it to wear for his Bar-Mitzvah. 
  

Q: Interesting. And you didn™t know, or you don™t reme mber? 

  

A: I didn™t know that she did, 
and I -- if she -- if I knew I 
ma y not have reme mbered it. 
  

Q: Right. 

  

A: In -- I reme mber behind our house in Prague 
was a sports -- like a st
adium, but it was just 
a fence and some  benches around for the worker
s -- workers -- sports -- workers sports 
association. And we played some  soc cer there,
 and in winter they poured some  water on 
it, and it was a skating rink. And there was a 
big hill be hind the house and it was -- kids 
were roaming there. So that was a -- 
  

Q: Now, how a r e things for you in Prague in 
1935?  This is two years 
after Hitler 
has taken 
over Germany, and things must be happening in
 Czechoslovakia, or 
di dn™t you feel that? 
  

A: ™35, nothing happened. I -- as I me ntione
d, I went to school, and I had no problems 
anybody, anything, except I said there were ve
ry few Jews, and there were no Sunday 
schools. The religion was taught once a week, 
and a rabbi, a priest, 
and a mi nister came , 
and in different classrooms , religious edu
cation was conducted. But I can only speak for 
the Jewish education. We  learned about the 
holidays, we learned to read the Hebrew 
alphabet. And at the end of the school year, 
the upper class dropped out -- it was for all 
the grades, kids of all grades together. So
 the upper classes droppe
d out, a new one came  
in, and we started from the beginning. So I 
knew very well the holiday
s, and the alphabet, 
and it was very repetitive. But this was the --  and the religious [i ndecipherable] the 

Catholic, Protestant and the Je
wish were state -- the rabbi was a state employee, the st ate 
financed, but they did not interfere with -- 
with religion. But it wa
s th -- there were no 
congregations, or in congregations, dues and 
fees. You went to whatever synagogue you -

- you wanted, but you went to th
e one nearest to your house. 
  

Q: Right. 

  

A: And as I said, was state supported, and so 
I don™t think there was a great pressure for 
higher education, in the religious -- 
  

Q: Did you have Jewish and non-Je
wish friends?  Do you reme mb er? 
  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
11 
 
 
A: Yeah, I had Jewish friends, and I had non-
Jewish friends. There were some  favorites in 
the classroom, and the most favorite one I me
t 1998 in -- in Prague. He™s older now, he™s 
old as I am. But I reme mber his face so I c
ould ma  -- I would recognize him. And looking 
back at the class pictur e, I recognized severa
l, which means I must have been close, or 
close with them. 
  
Q: Right. 

  

A: The other faces mean nothing. 

  

Q: We™re going to stop the tape now.

Q: Edgar, are you -- this 
is 1935, a little after your Ba r-M
itzvah. You were -- you were 
talking about Arnost Lustig, who had told you 
that your mother had given him your jac -- 

your suit for his Bar-Mitzvah. Are you consci
ous of what™s going on in Germany?  Do 
you hear discussions about the Nazis ta
king over, and what they™re doing? No. 
  

A: I don™t think so. 

  

Q: You don™t think so? 

  

A: No. 

  

Q: Okay. 

  

A: That was -- that was I don™t think it -- I 
have no read -- I have 
no read newspapers, and 
you don™t talk in front of kids about -- 
  

Q: Right. 

  

A: -- these difficult things, so I -- 

  

Q: And in school -- 

  

A: -- I was sheltered from that part of knowledge. 

  
Q: Right. And in school the 
kids were not talking? 
  
A: No, the only thing -- the onl
y thing that was different in 
school, after gym, if you took a -- 
a shower, they all came to look at me, becau
se in Europe, only Jews you get circumcised. 
  

Q: So they all looked at you? 

  

A: Pardon? 

  

Q: They all looked at you? 

  

A: They -- no, not all the time  --  

  

Q: [indecipherable]right,right. 

  

A: -- at least until they got a good look. So -- 

  

Q: Did they say things, or they just wanted to -- 

  

A: No, no, there™s a -- some did say how come
 you™re different, or whatever. Said oh -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
13 
 
 
  
Q: Right. What  were you like as a kid? 

  

A: Pardon? 

  

Q: What were you like at this point?  How -- how do you reme mb er yoursel -- oh.  

  

A: Oh, I have to go back to Karlsbad -- 

  

Q: Okay. 

  

A: -- does it matter if I go back? 

  

Q: No, it™s fine. 

  

A: I told you about the 
economic situation? 
  

Q: Yes. 

  

A: I did, in addition to running my rocking horse , there were a lot of Jewish stores where I 
went in the afternoon, helping out. There wa
s a -- I don™t know for what purpose, right 
next door in the baseme nt they
 were washing bottles, recycled
 bottles, I think for wine, I 
don™t know. I was working there, and getting 
some  money. I was delivering with a two 
wheeler, like they have on the ma rket, you kno
w, the -- the za -- vegetable people, a two 
wheeler, deliveries from another stor
e to different people. I was in a -- 
  
Q: You mean a two wheel bike with a ba sket? 
  

A: Pardon? 

  

Q: A two wheel bike with
 a basket, is that -- 
  

A: No, no, no, a -- a flatbed with two wheelers, with -- 

  

Q: Uh-huh, oh I see. Uh-huh. 

  

A: And -- and in another s -- I wa
s helping -- this was a leat her --
 leather store, raw hides, to 
shelve them and -- and stock -- like a stock 
boy. In another textile,
 it was the cleaning up. 
I always got some  money, and I reme mber one
 store where they gave me  some  money 
just to get out of there. 
  

Q: Why?  

  

A: I don™t know. I -- 

  

Q: But you were a kid. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
14 
 
 
  
A: Yeah. 

  

Q: And you we re -- wa-was this a t
ypical thing for kids to be doing? 
  

A: I don™t know, I don™t know about any others, but -- 

  

Q: And you we re earning some  money? 

  

A: Yeah,yeah. 

  

Q: Did you do this a -- do you reme mbe r , di
d you do this on your own, did you decide you 
wanted to do this, or did s -- did your parents -- 
  

A: Yeah, it was -- it was fun for me  to 
go be among other people and do some work. 
  

Q: So did you continue this -- 

  

A: I was -- all my life I was said I™m good w
ith my  hand, I was told, use my hand, so -- 
  

Q: So you kept doing it. 

  

A: So I couldn™t -- I started 
-- I ma y have started there. 
  

Q: Did you continue working when you were in Prague? 

  
A: No. 
  

Q: No? 

  

A: No. 

  

Q: And wa -- what™s the difference, do you think? 

  

A: I don™t think there was a opportuni
ty to that -- in -- in Karl
sbad, these were friends of -- 
friends of my parents, ma ybe they did it just
 to let me  earn some  money, or whether they 
really needed me, I don™t know. But I -- I di
d -- I did work, and I did some  active 
participation in the st ores.  
  

Q: So you™re going on, you™re 13 years old, you
™re 14, you™re 15, right? And life is pretty 
much the same , I gather. Now -- 
  

A: Yeah, the -- I -- there is 
not -- there were not main -- I 
can™t reme mber anything that™s 
worth me ntioning, that ha ppened in those y
ears, until ™38, in -- that would be worth 
noting down, not the -- 
  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
15 
 
 
Q: Well when -- when -- when do you become  an apprentice cook? 
  

A: In 1938, it came  so far into th -- the pure re
me mber or [indecipherable] with the help of 
Britain and France, the -- they supported th
e Germans, that the Czech governme nt gives 
up that border area where the ma jority of 
Ger man Nationals were. There was a -- a non-
aggression agreement, France and England on 
this side of Germany, Czechoslovakia on 
this side, should any -- should one be attacked, 
the others would assist. And at that time, 
Cha mberlain and Daladier decided -- I don™t 
know whether decided, th
ey thought if they 
give in this little bit to H
itler, they avoid World War II. 
So not only was, in September 
™38, this border area occupied by the 
Nazis, they also came beyond the Czech 

fortifications which they had on the border,
 against the Germans, so now they were 
standing there naked, without any 
fa -- without any safety, securi
ty or fortifications. So it 
was anticipated that Hitler™s appe tite will grow
 to the point  where he will occupy also the 
Czech lands. And the parents of Jewish teenager
s encouraged their kids to learn a trade, 
should immi gration become  necessary, they can
 support themselves wi
th work of their 
hands in a country whose language they don™t 
know. And then aunt of mi ne told my 

mother, ﬁWhy don™t you have the boy become a cook, so he neve
r has to go hungry? ﬂ 
There was no discussion of -- Moth
er agreed, so that that was it. 
  

Q: No discussion with you [indecipherable] 

  

A: No discussion about this. 

  

Q: Had you been in the kitchen, di
d you cook at all, at your house? 
  

A: I -- y-yes, I did, when Mother on her Yahrtze
it we nt to her 60 kilo
meter distance town, to 
the -- her parent™s grave, I cooked for my fath
er. He wasn™t able ev
en to ma ke a cup of 
tea for himself.  
  

Q: And you felt comfortable -- 

  

A: I was seven, eight years old, and I -- 

  

Q: Really? 

  

A: -- was -- simple, preparing the me  -- 

  

Q: But you felt comforta
ble in the kitchen? 
  

A: Yeah. 

  

Q: Yeah. 

  

A: I feel comfortabl e in any room. 

  

Q: Isee. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
16 
 
 
  
A: Some  more than others. 

  

Q: [indecipherable] 

  

A: So -- but that -- I don™t thi
nk that had anything to do with 
it, it was -- she suggested it, 
and I -- her butcher told her about the li
ttle buffet, you know, you -- you come  in, there™s 
a counter with those hot meals, and he sugge
sted I should start my apprenticeship in a 
small place, where I get exposed to everythi
ng. So I got exposed to bringing coal from 
the bay -- from the cellar, not only to the ki
tchen, but also to the third floor where his 
wife lived, where wi -- they lived, and taking 
down the ashes, and the -- whether they 
didn™t have yet -- they must 
have had, but they didn™t use 
them, vacuum cleaners, so I 
took the carpet down, and in the yard was 
a -- a beam, put the carpet over, and by hand 
you bang it, there was a -- I don™t know whethe
r you ever seen one, it™s a big antique 

[indecipherable] now. I beat th
e dust out of the carpet, and 
bring it up. Wh en she went to 
the ma rket I went behind her with two ba
gs. And I came back in time to go -- opposite 
was the police station, a theater
, and the director or the 
whatever you call it, of the 
railroad. And in Europe, it™s fanizer. I re
mi r palladucks.. At 10 o™clock you have a 
gabelfrühstück, a breakfa st with a fork, but
 you eat it with a s
poon, because it consists 
ma inly either of goulash soup, or tripe soup, wh
ich is a delicacy, I can™t
 find tripe, they -- 
they don™t -- I love it. Anyway, so you had tw
o carriages, and there we
re little poles -- but 
they were not poles like this, but they were lik
e -- like a cup, a large cup, and I went to all 
these three offices, deliver th
e soups, just in time to co
me  back at noon to wash the 
dishes, there were three tables in that -- 
opposite the counter wher
e some workers, or 
people came and consumed their meal there. So just came back to wash the dishes, and 

then clean up the -- the kitchen and the fl
oor, and the -- so that was my exposure. 
  

Q: But how old are you, 14? 

  

A: Yeah. 

  

Q: 1938-- 

  

A: Yeah. 

  

Q: -- you™re doing this, and you™re not going to school? 

  

A: No,no. 

  

Q: Was that because you stopped school, or be
cause you weren™t allowed to go to school at 
this point? 
  

A: No, the school system was such -- there we
re five grades in gr ad
e school, and then you 
had three compulsory and a f
ourth voluntary school, it was 
called -- I don™t know how to 
translate it, and it was a -- a public school, it
 would be equivalent of mi ddle school or 
high school here. And then there was a Gymn
asium where you had to ma ke an entrance 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
17 
 
 
exam and pa y. That was private and you had to
 pay. O-Of course I 
didn™t qualify -- I ma y 
have qualified with the exam, but I didn™t qu
alify with the payment. So I ma de -- I had 
the three -- three additional years through the five grades schools, and then came the 
decision about learning the trade. And so it 
remi nded me  of stories that I read. The 
aristocrats in central Europe, the Germans, or
 -- they had the ma nsions, or castles, and 
they had over there cooking staff, including pa
stry chefs and so. And every apprentice 
was stuffed. Eat, eat, eat. So he gets -- he gets
 fed up with it, and then
 he eats very little, 
so he won™t be too expensive by consuming a 
lot of food later. And this guy tried me  on 
plum dumplings. Eat, take, eat, 
eat. And I ate 79 of them. 
  

Q: 79? 

  

A: 79. But there were 79 pits that I had to spit 
out, so it was less in -- in actual weight and 
volume. 
  

Q: In one sitting? 

  

A: In one sitting, and he told me  right af
ter that, tomorrow you don™t have to come  any 
more. So -- so I wouldn™t say anyt hing at home,
 I left at si x in th
e morning, like I will -- 
would go to work. 
  

Q: So he fired you -- 

  

A: Yes. 

  

Q: -- because you did what he said? 
  
A: Yes. 

  

Q: He said eat as much as you want. 

  

A: Yeah. And then he saw it™s too expensive, so -- 

  

Q: I see, okay.  

  

A: I left every morning, hunting j
obs. I sat -- till eight o™clock 
I sat in a park, and by eight I 
went to different restaurants to ask if they 
need an apprentice. And one day I come  home, 
Father sees me  in the door, and that™s the ot
her time, besides handwri
ting that he gave me  
a shot. He said, ﬁYou were fired, and you didn™
t tell us.ﬂ [indecipherable] Luckily on that 
day I found a job. We ll, how did he find out
?  In -- you had to -- I think it was in 
Germany, it was also before the war, in
 Czechoslovakia that everybody had to be 
registered at the police station. And when
 you moved, you had to 
unregister here, and 
register there. And we had again, borders, and 
he went to the police station to register a 
border, and the waiter™s appren
tice came  with the soups, and he asked, ﬁHow is Edgar 
doing? ﬂ  He says, ﬁI don™t know, 
he isn™t working a week already, he was fired.ﬂ So that 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
18 
 
 
he didn™t tolerate, he thought I did some thing 
bad. And he first hit and then he asked the 
questions, that was the system. 
  
Q: He hit fi rst --  

  

A: Yeah. 

  

Q: -- and then he asked. 

  

A: Then he asked. 

  

Q: Did that -- did that hurt you 
-- I -- I mean, physically it may ha
ve hurt you a little bit, but 
did it hurt you -- 
  

A: No, it didn™t. 

  

Q: Itdidn™t. 

  

A: I -- I felt -- I felt I deceived him by not telling them. 

  

Q: Uh-huh. 

  

A: But I didn™t feel bad becaus
e I already had a job in a -- 
  

Q: Uh-huh. 

  
A: -- new restaurant, that™s why they n
eeded some body, it just opened. And it was a 
combination food establishment. From the st
reet you walked in, and it was the second 
only in Prague like a semi -self service. Y
ou took the tray, and you paid, and you walked 
among -- but there are people behind the c
ounter who gave you what you wanted, and 
you pay at the end of the counter. And then th
ere was an excellent restaurant, first class 
restaurant in the -- you wa lk 
through a passage, and inside 
was the restaurant, and up on 
the -- what here is the second floor, were f
unction rooms. And I learned everything from 
slaughterhouse to fine pastry. It
 was an excellent restaurant. 
  

Q: Why did they take you, do you think? 

  

A: Pardon?  

  

Q: Why-- 

  

A: Because they just opened, and they were looking for help. 

  

Q: And they were looking for people. 

  

A: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
19 
 
 
  
Q: Now, was this a typical way for a -- some one
 to just decide they™re going to be an 
apprentice, and you don™t necessarily appren
tice with one person, you apprentice within 
an institution of some  kind, you know? 
  

A: Yeah. I don™t know how others decided. Th
ey ma y have inclination for cooking, or 
necessity, or I d -- I don™t know
 why others started their apprenticeship. So -- and I 
moved -- as I said, I worked in the slaughter
house, I learned to sk
in cattle, and I -- 
  

Q: And who killed them? 

  

A: Pardon? 

  

Q: Who killed the cattle? 

  

A: Oh, some body went around -- 

  

Q: Somebody-- 

  

A: -- with a -- was a -- not a gun, but was so
me thing he had in the hand, he pushed the 
button and shot the cattle in the head. And it 
was not kosher, so I learned everything and I 
don™t know -- now when I pick up a 30 - 35 pound l
uggage going to the airport, it seems 
very heavy. I was carrying whole quarters of
 beef to -- in the -- in town was a 
marketplace where in the basement, the whol
e baseme nt was refrigerated. And because 
meat and beef was not as tender as we have he
re -- now here, beef is fed with corn, and in 
six months it™s big enough to be slaught
ered. So it means you have tender -- young, 
tender meat. There, it took much longer with gr
ass and hay to feed the cattle, and -- so it 
had to age. It was hanging three weeks in 
that uniform te mperature. And when you were 
able to scrape  off the mo ss from the meat, 
it was the right age. And I was on a spiral 
staircase, I was ca
rrying down whole quarters of b
eef, I don™t know how I did that. 
  

Q: And you we re a kid, too -- 

  

A: Yeah,yeah. 

  

Q: -- you were not an older guy. Huh. 

  

A: And -- okay, and then the next station 
was soup, with a soup chef, and then with a 
vegetable chef. And I reme mber for the s
oup, he was a young guy, but he was -- he was a 
nasty guy. But not because I was Jew, he was nasty to everybody. I had to cut for soup, 

so there were kettles where they were boili
ng all the bones, and all 
the meat that you cut 
off the ends, and what you didn™t want on the po
rtion to be served, and vegetable, and all 
the -- the peels of the onion, which gi ves good 
color to the soup. And as a filler for some 
soups, was a small dice of vegetable, carrots
, celery, theirs was the root celery, and 

parsley and had to cut those in uniform dice 
by hand, and when I had about this much in a 
pot, he came and looked through it and if wasn™t
 uniform, he t hrew it 
in the kettle, and I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
20 
 
 
had to start again. And it -- it is a -- 
it is a good me thod, you 
don™t want to work 
[indecipherable] while you do it. You learnto do it perfect. It™s
 like this, you know, you 
r e me mb e r  i t .  
  
Q: Right. So how long would you be at each 
station learning? When
 you learned soup -- 
  

A: This I don™t reme mber. Then the grill, and 
the roast, and then th
e -- well, braising, you 
know, because the meat was not as tender as th
is meat, and in spite of aging, for steaks, 
only the tenderloin and the sirloin wa s used. The other pi eces were not suitabl e. So these 

were -- there™s a goulash and butt roast, you kno
w, braised with -- with gravy. So that 
was the station where I worked. And of cour
se, not just the beef, there were pork and 
lamb and fis h. Yeah, after the slaughterhouse, I wa s in the baseme nt working with two 

butchers. They were from those quarters prep
aring a portion size, whether it was a roast, 
or whether it was steaks to be cut. I worked 
there before I got to the soups. And then the 
salad departme nt, and then the pastry. And th
e pastry was a pastry chef, and a fe ma le 
helper, and she loved me . I was lucky with 
wome n. No, she was very nice, she covered 
up for my mistakes, and you know, we were ma
king like a -- a sponge cake, but a little 
different, from 80 eggs. So if you spoil 80 eggs
, it was -- labor was cheap that time, and 
food was expensive. Here it™s different. So 
she was nice to me, and -- and on the salad I 
worked in, they were th -- the salad was not 
just salad, it was decorative items like fi sh in 
-- in aspic, and gelled, and -- a 
first class pl ace. And -- yeah? 
  

Q: About how long did the ho -- the whole 
apprenticeship last? Six months, a year? 
  

A: No, the whole apprenticeship
 went on till spring of 1941.  
  
Q: Really? 
  

A: Yeah. One day a week -- I worked six da
ys, and one day a week I went to vocational 
school where -- that was compulsory, to learn 
hygiene, and -- and about the foods, about 
the [indecipherable] and a description of 
handling, why this way, why that way. And 
when I came  from school at four o™clock, five
 o™clock, I had to change into uniform a nd 
help serving dinner. So -- 
  

Q: So you worked six days a week? 

  

A: Longdays. 

  

Q: Longdays. 

  

A: Longdays. 

  

Q: One day a week to school. 

  

A: No, work was five days, plus that ev
ening after school, and 
I had one day off. 
  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
21 
 
 
Q: And you had one day off. So -- 
  

A: Yeah. 

  

Q: So from 1938 until 1941 -- 

  

A: From fall of ™38 until spring of ™41 -- 

  

Q: ™41. 

  

A: -- there were two and a half years. 

  

Q: And you™re still being an apprentice? 

  

A: Oh yeah, it was a four year apprenticeship. 

  

Q: Huh. And as a -- at a certain point do you get 
a particular specialty that you work on more 
than others, or you keep worki
ng at each of these stations? 
  

A: First to learn, you move around, and then 
if the apprenticeship from the soup post was 
sick, so they took one [indecipherable] 
and you moved around, and you were able to 
substitute in every departme nt
. And t here was no anti-Semitism.
 All the time -- in ™41, the 
owner -- there were two owners
, one was more looking at th
e kitchen, the other one was 
looking at the other areas. And he was verynice, and he came and said he™s under great 

pressure to let me  go, and he didn™t expl -- di
dn™t have to explain to me  why, I knew. And 

at that time  I couldn™t get a job any more in an
ot he r rest aurant. Now, we
 were at ni -- it™s 
™41, you pushed me  too far ahead. 
  

Q: Yeah, I did -- yes, I was going to go back now. 

  

A: Six months after the occupation of -- 

  

Q: [indecipherable] 1939 March 

  

A: -- the Sudeten, they occupied -- 
came and occupied the Czech lands. 
  

Q: Yes. 

  

A: And [indecipherable] ends, it™s the area of
 today™s Czech Republic. The Sl ovaks had a -- 
at that time  already, a Fa scist governme nt, 
which cooperated with Germany, and were not 
occupied. So -- 
  

Q: When does occupation happen in -- 

  

A: Pardon? 

  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
22 
 
 
Q: When does occupation happen? 
  

A: March15
th
, 1935 -- ™39. And i mme diately thereafter they
 started to apply the -- what they 
call the Jewish laws, which were actually 
anti-Jewish laws. I th
ink you have knowledge 
about them -- about those -- 
  

Q: Tell me -- tell me what you reme mbe r . 

  

A: The first thing was to identify the Jews, 
although they ar -- p
hysically identify, and 
physically and visibly identify, 
because they had at the polic
e records they had all the 
Jews, because at the time you had to give
 your religion -- I don™t know for whatever 

purpose, but to -- at the po
lice station your registration 
was your religion known. So the 
first thing came  this yellow star to w
ear. And you had to wear it on every piece of 
outwear, so if you took your j
acket off, you had to have 
one on your shirt. And then, 
turning in all the valuables, including wedding rings, which I guess the Germans used to 

finance their war efforts. Then a radio, 
so you can™t listen to BBC. Everything was dual 
intent, for the Germans to enrich themselv
es with those items, and the second purpose 
was to deprive the Jews of whatever gave th
em pleasure or resistance. So the radios, so 
you couldn™t listen to BBC, and then musical in
strume nts had to be turned in. And then 
came restrictions to travel, 
you couldn™t go out, get out of 
your town. [indecipherable] 
You could not enter public areas like movies, 
theaters or parks, playgrounds. And Jews 
could travel in the st reetcar onl
y in the last  car, on the last
 platfor m standing. And there 
were ma ny more -- oh, ration tickets were issu
ed. There were three kinds of -- for the 
Germans, they were -- we  were already some
what rest ricted because was a war economy. 
The Czechs got less, and the Jews got almost 
a blank paper. And if
 you were caught with 
some thing that you could not have -- that was 
not on those tickets, it was -- this was 
punishable. So my parents had my food ration ti
cket, because I ate at the restaurant. And 
they get -- had 50 percent more of almost 
nothing, that™s -- how much that is, I don™t 
know. Mathematician has to figure that out. Bu t they were better off than some  other 

people.  
  

Q: We -- we™re going to need to -- 

  

A: Pardon? 

  

Q: We™re going to need to ta
ke a break and stop the tape. 
  

A: Again?  I didn™t see him touch you. 

  

Q: Again. Ah, he didn™t. 

 

End of Tape #2 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
23 
 
 
Tape #3 
  
Q: We were talking about the 
fact that your parents had your 
r-ration, and you were saying -- 
  

A: Food ration tick -- yeah. 

  

Q: -- food ra -- yes, which was 50 percent of 
nothing, right? But let me
 -- let me  -- let me  go 
back before we go forwa r d a little bit. 
Do you reme mber the day that the Germans 
ma rched in to Prague? 
  

A: Yes, I was standing in the 
sidewalk in my cook™s uniform, 
horrified to see them. They -- 
that restaurant was on the ma in -- 
  

Q: Really? 

  

A: -- through road in Prague, and that -- 
approaching through there. Everybody was -- 
people were crying, and -- 
  

Q: So the Czech -- the Czechs 
were not like the Aust rians?  
  

A: No, definitely not, but there were some  w
ho very soon adapted themselves to raising the 
arm, and -- yeah, you know, I think the Czechs 
had the -- I don™t want to sound im -- 
mi ssing the right word, but it doesn™t ma tter. Th
ey were not deeply involved in anything 
spiritual, I mean, they were 400 years under 
the Austrians, under the Ha psburgs before 
World Wa r I, then for 20 years -- and they 
tolerated it and coopera
ted, and they had to 
live -- ma ke a living. Then for 20 years they 
were free, from e i ght -- 1918 till ™38, and 
there were gr eat Czech pa triots. And when the Germans occupied, ma ny became 

sympathizers, and collaborants -- collaborator
s. Then there were again great Czechs after 
™45. There were fighters for Czech freedom 10 
mi nutes before the war ended, and -- not 
10 mi nutes, two days. And then the Communi
sts took over, they became  the great 
Communists. And in 1989, the bigge
st Communists, who were Etta Truff, and -- ma de all 
the money and stole all the money, t hey were 
the ones, the first ones who privatized state 
enterprises. And with their Communist conn
ections, they got it for almost nothing, and 

today they™re millionaires. So they can adjust
 in the [indecipherable] so, any condition. 
  

Q: And were you frightened when you saw the 
Germans come i n, the Wehrmacht come in? 
  

A: I didn™t know the full future impact of
 -- you know, the Germans now occupied the 
Czech lands, that -- that I knew is -- isn™t good. 
But the full range of 
impa ct on the Jews, I 
did not know, I didn™t -- I knew that Jews in
 Germany are persecuted and all that, but it 
someho w didn™t sink in immedi
ately, I am in danger. 
  

Q: And in fact you™re -- from ™38 
until ™41, you™re still in
 the same  place. 
  

A: Iwhat? 

  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
24 
 
 
Q: You™re still in the same  place -- 
  

A: Yeah. 

  

Q: -- between ™38 and ™41. 

  

A: Yeah. 

  

Q: So in a certain way, a lot doe
sn™t change. [indecipherable]  
  

A: For me , no. For me , not much has changed, no. 

  

Q: Do you think that things changed for your 
parents more than they changed for you during 
that period? 
  

A: I -- I am sure now -- shopping hours were I 
think twice a week, or three times a week 
from five PM till six, or from four PM till 
six, when everything was already sold out. So 
there were the -- 
  

Q: You mean shopping hours for Jews? 

  

A: For Jews, yeah. 

  

Q: So what did you think, as this young boy, be
ing an apprentice, watching the different 
restrictions being ma de, and have to wear
 -- did you -- you have come  to work with a 
Jewish star -- 
  

A: Yeah, yeah. But nothing else affected me , b
ecause  I didn™t have time to go to movies, and 
-- and I didn™t have time to lis
ten to the radio, and I did not
 have a musical instrument 
that I had to give up. So I was not 
-- I didn™t feel affected negatively. 
  

Q: Did Germans come into the cafeteria? Soldiers? 

  

A: Th-They mu st have, they
 -- I wasn™t out ther e -- 
  

Q: You weren™t out in front -- 

  

A: -- I -- I was in -- 

  

Q: -- you were in the back. 

  

A: -- the kitchen. And if they were, I didn™t
 wear the star on the 
uniform. Only on the 
st r e et coat . 
  

Q: Only on the street. 

  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
25 
 
 
A: Yeah. 
  

Q: Huh. And did you begin to feel some thing in
 -- when you were in the back, working with 
the other pe -- were there other Jews? 
  

A: No, no, the -- 

  

Q: You were the -- were the o -- 

  

A: No, I was the only Jew.  

  

Q: You were the only Jewish person? 

  

A: And they didn™t look at me , and 
-- because we didn™t go to the gym. 
  

Q: But they knew you were Jewish? 

  

A: But they knew I am Jewi sh, and they didn™t 
treat me worse than the others. There was a 
tough -- tough apprenticeship. I could show you 
but is showing only up to here, these two 
prong forks that the cooks use?  I have several marks on my behind, when I wasn™t 

moving t -- fa st enough. 
  

Q: They would -- 

  

A: Yes. So, but not just me  -- 

  
Q: Waseveryone? 
  

A: -- all -- all the apprentices. 

  

Q: And how many apprentices we
re there by the way, do you know? 
  

A: Oh, there were quite a fe  -- they -- on 
every post was one, at least one, and then there 
were some  who replaced you when you went to
 school, and there were some additional 
ones that were needed at time of serving 
and y -- lunch and dinner. And there were 
functions also. So there were at
 least eight, ni ne apprentices. 
  

Q: But I thought you said you did serve some ti
me s, when you -- when you went back after 
school in the evening. 
  

A: Yeah, at the -- me -- me - -  at the counter 
where the waiter broughthis -- his order, we 
assembled the -- the plates, or that -- 
  

Q: Oh, I see, not at -- you didn™
t serve the -- the plates at -- 
  

A: No, not sit -- no, no, no -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
26 
 
 
  
Q: -- uh-huh, I see what you mean. 

  

A: -- no, that was -- that was the service -- 

  

Q: Right. 

  

A: -- the cooks provided -- 

  

Q: Right,right. 

  

A: -- for the waiters. Yeah. 

  

Q: Did your father -- 

  

A: I am glad you qualified that. 

  

Q: Yes, cause I wasn™t quite sure what you m
eant. What was your father working at when he 
was in Prague, what was his job? 
  

A: In Karlsbad he was a salesman for textile 
because  that™s what he knew from Vienna, from 
before. And I guess he couldn™t find anything in 
that line in Pr ague. So once a salesman, 
always a salesman, he started to sell coal
. And I don™t know whethe
r to individual home  
owners because the truck came and every 
house had a -- a cellar, with through the 
window they put the coal down. I do not know if
 there were several te
nants in the house, 
whether each one had his own storage for the coal. Wa  -- he was -- he was selling coal, 
and it™s cold only half a year, 
so it™s only about half the income , the yearly income . So -- 
  
Q: So things were not easy. 

  

A: I think -- I think he also de
livered to fact -- sold to fact
ories and so, which were running 
on coal. Oil was not at that time  in use fo
r production. I don™t know 
what electricity was 
made from, but I™m sure it was from coal
, because it was cheap and abundant in 
Czechoslovakia. 
  

Q: And did he keep hi
s job till ™41, do you know? 
  

A: No, I don™t -- don™t remember. I -- I -- 

  

Q: You don™t reme mber. You didn™t own th
e apartment where you were living? 
  

A: No,no. 

  

Q: You rented the apartment. 

  

A: Rentedit. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
27 
 
 
  
Q: So, were you getting paid as an apprentice, so that you could -- 

  

A: Yes, I did get -- I did get 
60 crowns a month, which is two crowns a day, which allowe d 
me  to go twice to the opera. It
 was a contribution, was little, sm
all. I think at later years I 
got little mo re, but that 60 
initial, stayed in my mind. 
  

Q: And did you give most of this money to your parents? 

  

A: All of it. 

  

Q: All of it.  

  

A: I didn™t have time to spend it. So after he to
ld me  that he can™t keep me , I know I took off 
my star and I found a job in a resort hot
el on the Czech-Bohemi an Highlands. I don™t 
reme mber how I got it, I don™t reme mber how I 
got there, I don™t reme mber the name or 
location. I do reme mber having work there, and 
what impressed me in my me mory is that 
one day a man came from -- came in and asked me , ﬁ Are you a Jew?ﬂ I said, ﬁWhy 

would you want to know? ﬂ And he 
said, ﬁI just was at the po
lice station and I heard them 
say that at this hotel works a Jew, and 
they come  to pick him up.ﬂ So I dropped 
everything, changed my clothes, went to therailroad station and went home. I didn™t even 

pick up the money for -- for -- for that period th
at I didn™t get paid. So that was my -- but 
I -- I don™t reme mber many details. And I 
have ma ny such e mpty windows in my 
me mory. Some  -- some  unbelievable ones. So th
en the only job I could get was at the -- 
at a -- 
  
Q: Tell me something, what is it you th
ink you™re -- you™re not reme mbering? 
  
A: I don™t reme mber the town, I don™t reme mber
 the hotel, the name. 
I don™t recall like how 
the kitchen looked. But I know that where I wa
s standing when this ma n came in and told 

me that they comi ng to get the Jew. 
  

Q: Maybe the shock of wha t  he saidwas so great that it blocked out -- 

  

A: Yeah. Like people reme mber when Kenne
dy was shot, or when 9-11 happened, where 
they were.  
  

Q: Right. So you went back -- 

  

A: I di -- 

  

Q: -- right di -- did -- you obviously 
are not wearing the Jewish star. 
  

A: Not wearing the -- the star on the train. 

  

Q: Do you look Jewish, in terms of wha t  people -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
28 
 
 
  
A: DoI? 

  

Q: Well, I have no -- I have no idea what that
 means. I never knew that that meant. 
  

A: No, I think -- I think the Europeans categor
ize the people, they -- 
they recognize the Jews 
by the nose, or other features, I don™t know. 
  

Q: Mm-hm. So were you suspic
ious looking then?  Did you -- 
  

A: I didn™t act suspicious
ly, and -- I acted as if 
I belonged there, and -- 
  

Q: Now there™s obviously -- well, this is 1941, have
 -- have the Germans attacked the Soviet 
Union by then? 
  

A: Oh yes, in -- in ™39, in the end of ™39 they attacked Poland. 

  

Q: Poland, right, but the Sovi
et Union wasn™t comi ng -- 
  

A: And as soon as they had Poland, they broke th
eir pact with the Sovi
ets, and they went on. 
  

Q: Right. 

  

A: The -- the only job is that -- I coul d get wa
s at a dining hall that 
the Jewish community -- 
commu -- not the community at large, the co
mmunity center you would 
call it, the keela -
- 
  

Q: Keela,uh-huh. 

  

A: -- is -- is ma intained for 
immi grants from Poland, because 
they couldn™t get the working 
permit, or not to endanger the Czech™s jobs. 
So the community at large, pl us the keela, 
had to take care of them. Clothes is -- wa
s collected, bedding and th
en other things, and 
they got a substantial meal at
 noon at this dining hall. I di
dn™t me ntion, when this aunt 
told my mot her I should become  a cook, that 
ma ny times it will be very beneficial to me, 
and ma ybe s o me  those -- some  of those rela
ted to me. So the fi rst time was that my 
parents had my ration ticket and I got a 
good -- good meal. Not 79 dumplings, but I ate a 
good meal. So I worked there, and thi -- anot
her advantage of it was that I was one of 
only two Jewish cooks in that whole occupied area. 
  

Q: Really? 

  

A: Which brought me  al mo st to the social 
level, or importance level of lawyers. 
  

Q: Really? 

  

A: What? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
29 
 
 
  
Q: Really? 

  

A: No, wa -- one of two Jewish cooks, and they were needed.  

  

Q: Maybe more needed than lawyers. 

  

A: So one was already in that dining hall and I was the second. 

  

Q: But was he much older than you, or was he -- 

  

A: He was older, he was born in 1919. 

  

Q: But he™s only five years older. 

  

A: More -- yeah, but more experienced -- 

  

Q: Yeah.Yes. 

  

A: -- more -- I worked until the fall, when th
e ma n who ma naged this dining hall told me  
that he was designated to become  a me mber of
 a  council of elders in charge of supply and 
feeding and economy, in a ghetto 
to be created to hold all th
e Jews from the Czech lands. 

And he would appreciate if I, as a rarit
y, one of the two cooks, would volunteer and go 
there with the very fi rst transport to pr epar
e kitchens, train people 
so they could be fed 
when they arrived by the thousands. 
  
Q: And who wa s this person? 
  

A: His name  was Karl Schliesse
r, very nice, very nice ma n. 
  

Q: And about how old did you 
think he was at the time ?  
  

A: Oh, he was a [indecipherable] person I didn™
t judge what he -- he already had kids and I 
know he had a daughter who was older than I 
was. Anyway, he imme diately contradicted 
himself. He said to ghetto to hold all the Je
ws. And then he said if I volunteer and come  
with him, he would protect my parents from 
being deported further to the east from that 
ghetto. As a me mber of the Council of Elders, 
he would protect my parents from -- that 
means befor e  this ghetto, Terezín, Theresienstadt
 was created, the officials at the -- at the 
Jewish community knew that it™s not going to be a permanent ghetto, it™s going to be a 

transition station for further deportations. 
  

Q: Did you understa -- did you understand that ther
e was a conflict in what he said, that 
there was a contradi ct
ion?  Or did you -- 
  

A: No -- I -- I -- I knew that -- imme diately th
at all the Czech Jews would come  there, but 
not all would stay there. A
nd my father was veheme ntly 
opposed to my volunteering, you 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
30 
 
 
don™t volunteer for some thing like this, unknow
n. But I thought -- i-in 
the fi rst instance 
he said to hold all the Jews of -- so if my 
turn would come  eventually, and if he will be 
able to keep his word, I believed if he c -- wi
ll be able, that he would. I™m ahead of the 

game , and my parents have a chance to st
ay there -- there wa
s no thought about the 
concentration camps, and annihilation and 
then gassing and the -- that was not known 
until the very end. Nobody outside the concen
tration camp knew what™s expecting the 
deportees upon their arrival in
 Auschwitz, or wha -- that was not known of Auschwitz -- 
and people would not have even believed it 
and have not believed it later on. There was 
[indecipherable] always optimistic. Now -- 
and there were some  people who were 
arrested for political -- by the Germans, 
opponents. And they later got -- the fa mily 
received a card that he died, that family
 me mber arrested six months ago, died in 
Auschwitz for -- on a heart attack. So 
those who came afterwards, and came to 
Auschwitz, wrote back. They couldn™t say, I™m 
in Auschwitz, but they wrote, in these 30 
allowed words, I am at Uncle Joe™s, or w
ith Uncle Joe, to let them know he™s in 
Auschwitz. But these people have interpreted 
it, Joe is alive, he
 is not -- you know, 
always -- 
  

Q: Yeah. 

  

A: -- took the optimistic -- 

  

Q: Optimistic,yeah. 

  

A: -- part of the situation. So -- 

  

Q: T-Tell me something. Your fath
er wa s absolutely against it. 
  

A: Yeah. 

  

Q: What did your mother say, since she wa
s a very strong person in the family 
[indecipherable] 
  

A: She was less against it. 

  

Q: She was less against it? 

  

A: Less against it, because I said that, what
 he promised, and she thought there ma y be a 
chance. And nobody expected it to be , you 
will -- okay, you will be di splaced, and 
replaced some where else . Nobody had an idea, 
a military barracks that the families won™t 
be -- there we re ghettos before in Poland, but
 these were voluntary ghettos where Jews 
have, on their own will, congregated to be away
 from the anti-Semites, and felt better and 
safer, and on their own. So these were volunt
ary ghettos, and there the Germans just drew 
a barbed wire around the district, and th
ey had the ghetto. But people were living 
together, ma ybe cramme d, ma ybe, but fam -- so
 they made up -- the -- the idea was, we 
were living elsewhere with only Jews, and just
 the situation of -- of living arrangement 
will change. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478

Q: So was this an easy decision fo
r you in spite of your father™s -- 
  

A: Yeah, I -- 

  

Q: -- or was it a difficult decision? 

  

A: -- I -- no, no, I -- I decided, this time I pr
evailed. And I went to the -- on November 24
th
, 
1941, with 342 hand-picked me n, and we assemb le
d -- we came from home, directly to 

the railroad station, assembled 
there, and it was the last time 
we traveled in a passenger 
train. 
  

Q: Oh, you were in a passen
ger train for that trip? 
  

A: In a passenger train to -- 

  

Q: Were you the only cook, o-or
 that other guy was there -- 

  

A: The other one was too. 

  

Q: -- was there.  

  

A: But he did not volunteer. He did not 
volunteer, and he was put in anyway. 
  

Q: Uh-huh. 

  
A: So-- 
  

Q: 342 y -- mos tly young men? 

  

A: No, these were th -- I -- depends
 what is young. Today everybody under -- 
  

Q: -- is young, right. 

  

A: -- 75 is young for me . But these were accomp
lished engineers, technicians, plumbers, 
carpent ers. To transform the town, which 
was a fortress town, built in 1780, with 12 
me ter thick walls, built in octagon, you have seen the plan. And each corner was in a -- 

shaped in a triangle so you could see the 
enemy approach, if he did. And the 12 me ter 

thick walls, and the moat around it, and the mo
at was filled on the river that was running 
just by the walls. And there were only three gate
s into this town, which is a ideal pl ace to 
hold someone whom you don™t want to let es
cape. Those gates, wh-when we cleaned 
there -- 
  

Q: Let me as -- let me go back just for a 
second. Are -- is -- is everybody feeling, when you -
- when you go to the railroad station and you™re
 waiting for the train, if you™re waiting, I 
don™t know if you™re waiting -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
32 
 
 
  
A: Yeah. 

  

Q: -- but th -- are people nervous
, or they™re fairly relaxed -- 

  

A: Yeah-- 

  

Q: -- what is this -- 

  

A: -- no, no, they were nervous, they -- 

  

Q: -- tha -- what ™s the sense -- 

  

A: -- all those, the others, the 
341, they were all called up to go. 
  

Q: I see. They -- it wasn™t volunteer. 

  

A: I was the only volunteer 

  

Q: Uh-huh. 

  

A: There™s another word for it,
 it called me shuganah. But -- 
  

Q: Yeah, it certainly is.  

  

A: But-- 
  
Q: But you really were the onl
y volunteer amongst all of them? 
  

A: Yeah. And later on people volunteered wh
en the husband was taken with one transport 
and the wife volunteered to go with the next hoping to be with him, this -- this were only 

kind -- other kind of volunteerism. So -- 
  

Q: So it™s not a calm situat
ion for people, there™s -- 
  

A: No, they know -- they -- I don™t know what th
ey thought when they thought they™re going 
to build something and then they come  back home . 
  

Q: Uh-huh. 

  

A: Youknow?  

  

Q: Yeah. You don™t know. 

  

A: I don™t know that. But I was the -- I think th
e only one who was told it™s going to be a 
ghetto to hold all the Jews, and -- and so on. I 
think, I™m not sure. It was not a frightful 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
33 
 
 
situation, concerned, worried. I 
think that the prevailed -- th
e -- the th-thought prevailed, 
we are going to do a job some where and we come back. Because there were before 
groups sent to certain areas where the German
 a -- the -- the head, or [indecipherable] or 
wife was residing in a castle 
and the group was sent there to
 do the landscaping, and then 
they came back when it was finished. And th
ere was another group working in the forest, 
I™m not sure what they did there, and they came back. So I think that did example mus t  

have been in their mi nd, because it wa s not nervous, it -- it was upsetting, taken away 

from your wife and kids, but so we were a
llowed to take with us 110 pounds of luggage. 
And it consisted ma inly, going into the wint
er, of warm clothing, and everyone had the 
110 pounds, and two pair of pants, and two j
ackets, and another coat, and you know, to -- 
the -- to --  
  

Q: You mean that you were wearing?  Yeah. 

  

A: -- to -- to -- that was not
 among the weighable luggage, 
to augment your possessions. 
  

Q: So you assume d you we re not comi ng back. You knew that. 

  

A: I -- I -- I was sure, yeah. 

  

Q: Did -- did Sc hlaisser -- is -- is it Schlisser or  -- 

  

A: Schliesser. 

  

Q: Schliesser. 

  
A: Schliesser. 
  

Q: Was he with you on the train, or had he gone before? 

  

A: No, he came  one -- he came  
about six, seven days later. 
  

Q: Isee. 

  

A: Or four days later, we -- the whole Council 
of Elders. And the Counc
il of Elders were the 
officials at the Jewish community in Prague. 
  

Q: The same  Jewish community 
where you were in the kitchen? 

  

A: Yeah, I didn™t know that when I was in the 
kitchen, they were in another town -- another 
par -- ch -- part of Prague, in the -- 
  

Q: So who accompanied the -- you -- the 342 people on the train?  Did you just go by 
yourselves? 
  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
34 
 
 
A: I don™t know. That I don™t know. I was young, 
I didn™t know the -- what arrangeme nts, 
how -- whether some body wa
s in charge or not. 
  
Q: Uh-huh. 

  

A: But on the railroad station -- 
the town does not have a railro
ad station, it™s two and a half 
kilome ters in another town -- nearby town. There we were, expected by Czech 

gendarmes. 
  

Q: Uh-huh. 

  

A: And it™s like state police. And they were -- 
they accompanied us, and here they were also 
the ones who guarded the th
ree gates, not the SS. 
  

Q: The three gates of Terezín. 

  

A: Yeah. 

  

Q: Uh-huh. 

  

A: So we were brought in to what was called 
the Sudeten barracks, and when we entered, the 
gates closed behind us. And when we came there, it was open. We ca me  in, and the gates 

closed. So that was the fi rst time suspicion of some prison type accommodation is 

beginning. We were assembled on the courty
ard, and the commandant was a doctor, I 
don™t know what kind of a doctor, he was not
 a cardiologist I know, because he didn™t 
have a good heart. But they assembled us and 
told us everything we are not allowed to 
do. 
  
Q: Wa s this Sydell? 

  

A: Sydell. 

  

Q: Yeah. 

  

A: And there was not much left that wecould do, other than ou
r daily work. And the 
carpenters went immediately to work -- th
ere was a supply of lumber, ma ki ng table by 

table bunks to push as many people into thos
e military wards as possibl e. And I didn™t 
have anybody -- the -- since -- during the Czech
 re -- Czechoslovakia, in 1938, they ke pt 
about 5,000 soldiers of different -- how would 
you say?  Infantry and Calvary and artillery 
-- 
  

Q: Differentunits. 

  

A: Each one had it™s own barracks, 5,000 of
 them, and 3,000 civilian population was living 
there. And they were livi ng [i ndecipherable] and fr om the military. And there was some  

far mers with fields around it. And we only la
ter found out that the gates closed so those 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
35 
 
 
Jews don™t mi ngle with that other populati
on. But we didn™t know that that was the 
reason. 
  
Q: So the gates closed -- 

  

A: And we -- 

  

Q: -- in barracks. 

  

A: Yeah. And those -- 

  

Q: I -- I™m going to have to stop you. 

  

A: Yeah? 

  

Q: So hold your thought. Re me mber where you are -- 

  

A: Yeah-- 

  

Q: -- because I™m going to change the tape. 

  

A: -- we closed the gates. 

  

Q: Yes.

Q: Edgar, I just want to get this picture ag
ain. The 342 of you were brought into the Sudeten 
barracks, into the courtyard of 
the Sudeten barracks. And then th
e -- the gate that cl oses is 
the gate from the barracks? 
  

A: The gate from the barracks, yeah. 

  

Q: So that you™re going to be  kept
 from the Czechs who -- and the -- 
  

A: The German -- it was ma inly Germans. There is -- 

  

Q: MainlyGermans. 

  

A: -- [indecipherable] on the -- on the border 
already, the s -- the Sudeten, part of the 
Sudeten. 
  

Q: Right. So they wanted to separate the 
Jews from these other people until they -- 
  

A: Which we didn™t know, we thought prison bec 
-- now, those who had to -- who had work 
outside, like some  of the engineers, who had to 
-- thei r job wa s to increase  the capacity of 
the utilities, servi
ng currently 8,000 people, to acco
mmodate 60,000. So the electricity 
and the -- and the water and the sewer, all th
ese -- these people were specialists picked 
for that job, and some  of it was outside -- 
  

Q: Outside. 
  
A: -- the barracks, and outside the ghetto. So th
ey went with -- accompanied by a gendarme.  
  

Q: A Czech gendarme. 

  

A: Czech gendarme . And s o me  of the m were very good, they felt, you know, that one Czech 
to another, and the re-relati
on didn™t ma ke a difference. Some  were bad, and some  were 
afraid to be good. 
  

Q: Yeah. 

  

A: So there three categories.
 You had to know with whom you a r e dealing. So you could go 
out only accompanied by a work detail. 
  

Q: So you™re really in a -- in a rather small area? 

  

A: I was inside the barrack, never got out.
 I mean, never, for a certain period -- 
  

Q: Right. 

  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478

A: -- until it was filled. Anyway, 
I started to say that until 1938, 
those barracks were used -- 
occupied and used by the military and si
nce the German occ upation, there was no 
military in those barracks, they were closed. A
nd of course, they started to deteri orat e, a 
lack of maintenance, and weather, and rust
y and dusty, and -- and repairs, the floor, the 
pipes. So -- but I couldn™t ge
t anybody to help me  to prepar
e the kitchens, because they 
had their assi gned job. Until later they got the id
ea that it™s good to have so me  relations 
with the kitchen under the condi
tions we were living at, and 
they came and helped, that 
they did some  manual work, and the engineers 
did some  repair. And they finally got the 
one kitchen going. There were tw
o kitchens in the Sudeten. 
  

Q: Two kitchens in the Sudeten. So what ha
 -- how did people eat when you first came?   
  

A: We were told to take a three day some thi
ng -- for the first day some  sandwiches, and then 
some  non-perishable food like a 
canned food or so, there was no frozen, or whatever -- 
  

Q: Right,right. 

  

A: -- prepared meals. So 
for three days we took -- 
  

Q: Your own food. 

  

A: -- our own food, and we were able on the 
third day already to pr
epare a soup, and -- and 
bread was delivered for the 342.  
  

Q: So, did you ma ke the soup because you didn™t ha ve any help?  Who ma de  the soup? 

  
A: That wasn™t difficult to ma ke, the soup, that
 if you did nothing else
. That -- that -- the 
other cook was there, we  worked together. 
He was not very ent
husiastic about it.  
  
Q: And what did you have, huge -- huge pots? 

  

A: Kettle, like you saw in that picture. 

  

Q: In picture, huge -- 

  

A: Huge, yeah, 400 liter, hundred gallon kettle
s. Some  were steam heated from a central 
steam line, which then had to be augmente
d, the capacity I mean, 
of which. And some  
burn coal. So there -- you found -- I™m jumping 
ahead again. Okay, we™re in that kitchen 

and preparing it and we got rea
dy, and six days later, a tran
sport of thousand people came  
from Brno, that™s the 
capital of Moravia. 
  

Q: Right. 

  

A: And what -- it was the job 
of the Council of Elders, and 
now while -- if 
the Council of 
Elder was in Terezín, so there were ot her o
ffi cial s in Prague, and those big communities, 
that had to put the thousand people to fill a tr
ansport, on German orders. This is a terrible 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
38 
 
 
responsibility to decide whom
 you dislocate from their re
gular life, which was lousy 
already anyway, but it was some thing known, 
and send them away. But what they did, 
they kept families together. In my case it was negative, because they wanted me  to be 
together with my parents, so they came  th
ree weeks after me, while they otherwise mi ght 
have, by chance, stayed longer in their accommodations at home. 
  

Q: Right. 

  

A: And this principle prevailed also when tran
sports were put together from Terezín to the 
east. 
  

Q: They would bra -- keep families together. 

  

A: Families together, unless one of the family 
me mb ers were -- was in a job -- it could work 
both ways -- a job that was necessary either for war industry or  -- or  for maintena nce of 

the town -- functioni ng of the town, they eith
er kept the one and send the rest, or they 
kept the whole family back. And I don™t know who and why and how these decisions 

were ma de, but these were three ways of pe
ople staying in Terezín 
till the end, or being 
shipped out. 
  

Q: Right. Now, Edgar, you™re 17 year
s old in 1941 when you™re deported. 
  

A: Yeah, 17 and a half 

  

Q: Seven -- 17 and a half, that™s right, 
because in February you™re going to be  18. 
  
A: 17 and a half. 
  

Q: That™s right, in 1942.  

  

A: Al most three quarter. 

  

Q: Right. Do you feel as an adult ma n at this 
point? I mean, how -- wh
at is it -- who -- who 
are you? 
  

A: It™s hard for me  to say, it y -- sounds like 
bragging, but my wife wa -- brings that up, 
whereas that it was unbelievable that age 
17 and three quarters, I could organize the 
setting up of the kitchen, and not only that. 
When that first transport came of -- I don™t 
reme mber what the other one did. 
  

Q: The other cook? 

  

A: He was the -- yeah, he -- he worked alone, 
but he did not initiate 
anything. I think he was 
ma d that he was taken out of his regular life.
 Wi th that first transport, I me ntion whole 
fa milies came , so I had some body staff the 
kitche n with wome n who knew about food, 

who knew about preparation of food, underst
ood food, although they never worked for 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
39 
 
 
thousand people, I -- I -- neither did I. 
But at least some body w
ho knows how to handle 
food -- food. Now, there was flour in -- in th
e warehouses. There was some sugar, there 
was some margarine, and interestingl y, ther
e was plenty of spices. Pepper, paprika, 
caraway. I guess that was not a -- an item th
e Germans were short of. But there was no 
vegetabl e, there was no fruit. There was occasionally some mar malade, and not to jump 

too fast, we started up one kitchen, and then, 
or after that first transport, every second 
day, third day, another thousand people
 came. And I don™t reme mber how ma ny 
thousands that Sudeten held, but when it wa
s full, the Germans decided to separate 
women from the men. 
  

Q: So at first when they came  to
 the Sudeten, they
 were together? 
  

A: Often fa milies together, yeah. And I neve
r went up to look how they a-accommodated 
with a -- a family occupies one of the three s
ections of the bunk, or a
bove each other, or -
- 
  

Q: And how -- how were the -- do you know how
 the bunks were set up?  Is this like a 
dormitory? 
  

A: Yeah. 

  

Q: Or were there actually separate room?  Th
ere were not separate rooms, it was all -- 
  

A: No, no, there was the -- 
this military barrack -- 
  

Q: Isee. 
  
A: -- was one long -- 

  

Q: Isee. 

  

A: -- one long room, and then th
ey put up the bunks this way. 
  

Q: So where are you staying? 

  

A: I was staying in one
 -- one of -- one -- 
  

Q: One of these bunks? 

  

A: One of these bunks, yeah. I wasn™t priv
ileged yet, later I ha
d some  privileges. 
  

Q: Uh-huh. And did you have bunkmat es? 

  

A: Yeah. So when they se -- decided to se
parate the wome n from 
the me n, t hey designated 
the Dresner for the women. That other cook went
 there, and with the wome n went girls of 
all ages, and boys under age 15. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
40 
 
 
  
Q: Oh. 

  

A: Those 15 and older stayed ther
e, and they were assigned jobs. 
  

Q: Stayed in Sudeten. 

  

A: Everyone -- everyone ha
d some  job designated. 

  

Q: So Sudeten is first, then Dresden is second? 

  

A: Then Dresner, yeah. 

  

Q: Is it Dresden or dres -- 

  

A: Dresner. 

  

Q: Dresner. 

  

A: Dresden is the town, and th
e designation is Dresner -- 
  

Q: Isee. 

  

A: -- it™s [indecipherable]  

  

Q: Right. 
  
A: -- barracks, it™s instea
d of an [indecipherable]  
  

Q: Mm-h m.  

  

A: And-- 

  

Q: Did you also have to set up th
e kitchens in -- in Dresner? 
  

A: In Dresner he did. 

  

Q: Hedid. 

  

A: He did. But he stayed there, and when 
Dresner wa s full and anot
her barracks was -- the 
kitchen to be set up, I we nt. 
  

Q: So then who took over in 
Sudeten?  You -- you don™t know. 
  

A: I hope by that time  people were already cap
able of running -- what was interesting, mo st 
of the so-called head chefs in thos
e kitchens, were for mer butchers. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
41 
 
 
  
Q: Really? 

  

A: Although the -- no meat was handled. Oh yes,
 when the horse died some where in the 
neighborhood, we got it in -- 
we got it -- we got -- 
  

Q: You got in the meat. 

  

A: We got the meat. And if there was a butcher
 store originally, for 
the germ -- yeah -- I™m 
handling it too fast.  
  

Q: That™sokay. 

  

A: We were isolated and walking from ba
rracks to barracks or  to the workplace, 
accompanied by gendarmes. By June 1942, the 
last of these town inhabitants was 
evacuated by the Germans. I don™t know how they were accommodated, whether they 

found them, but that wasn™t my problem. 
  

Q: Whe -- when -- when in 1942 did this happen?  Ea rly? 

  

A: June. 

  

Q: June of 1942? 

  

A: June™42. 

  
Q: Mm-h m.  
  

A: And from then on, the gates of the barr
acks were open, and when you finished your job, 
your work, your assigned work, you could go wi
th that family and move a r ound without 
being accompanied or guarded. So I went from
 barrack to barracks, and pa rt of just  
preparing the kitchen, was also training people to
 -- to -- I di d get information of what is 
in the -- in the warehouse. And I got info
rmation how ma ny people are already living 
there. So based on that, I ma de use of supplie
s for individual barracks,
 and later on even a 
sophisticated me nu, how ma ny 
grams of what to -- 
  

Q: Really?  So how did you figure this out?  I m
ean, these are muc h larger populations than 
you were ever trained to feed. 
  

A: Yeah. I told you, there™s one -- there were so
me women who were able to admi nister the 
kitchen, not just the butchers, a
nd that [indecipherable] it™s --
 it™s funny that there was no 
meat, but the butchers seemed to be th
e best administrators of a kitchen. 
  

Q: Did -- w-were you the person who was in co
ntrol of the amount of -- of whatever 
ingredients could be sent, wh
ether it was flour, it was sugar,
 it would be sent to this 
barrack, or that barrac
k, or this kitchen? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
42 
 
 
  
A: That -- that started out th
is way. Later there were people who were in business, food 
business, so I had stores at -- and grocer
ies and -- and other related business. They 
became -- they became the warehouse -- o-oper
ating the warehouse, and this -- they 
didn™t got the information, and without my inte
rference or -- or participation, based on 
the initial set-up, deliver
ed directly to -- 
  

Q: And were there equal rations given to each 
barrack, or were there 
different -- di fferences 
in the barracks? 
  

A: Not in the barracks, the difference was -- 
and that was -- you know, the Council of Elders 
had very -- they were, so to say, the town 
admi nistration. They were actually a cabinet, 
there was a man designated for 
transportation and for labor a
nd for health and for supply, 
and -- and other departments. But they had ve
ry little room for initiative. That was all 
based on strict rules set by the Germans. 
However they, where possible, they applied 
their own decision ma king. Like for instance fo
r the children, and that was a little bit 
later, the -- a children™
s kitchen was -- was created, that
 had more of the food a growing 
child needs, because children were our fu
ture. And they decided those who had hard 
labor assignme nts to get more
 food. Of course, that was ta
ken away from the general 
population, but the general population was so la
rge, that the few privileged groups -- and 
it wasn™t privileged, was rewarded appropriate
ly, larger por -- rations. But it did not 
impact tremendously. 
  

Q: You don™t think it impacted th
e general population very much? 
  

A: Not much was taken away from all the t
housands of the regular population to feed the 
few -- to improve the ration of the children 
and the -- those who have hard -- performe d 
hard labor. So at -- this wa
y I was hopping from one barrack to
 another, trying to get the 
most capable person to stay behind and r
un it, all while I was 18 - 18 and a half. 
  

Q: Did you feel -- 

  

A: Important? 

  

Q: -- important, yeah. 

  

A: No. 

  

Q: No. 

  

A: No. I -- I don™t think -- I liked to 
do that. I felt good ha
ving a responsibility. 
  

Q: Yes. 

  

A: Being trusted and so, yeah, but -- 

  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
43 
 
 
Q: Did -- did you have contact w
ith the Council of the el -- El
ders, with Schl
iesser, after you 
got there? Was there meet -- for inst ance, a meeting?  
  
A: It -- it -- not -- really not
, really not. He had his jobs to do, and I did mi ne, and there was 
no -- he did -- except those, as I said, the in
structions as to portion size for the kids, and 
then the decision to create a kit -- a 
children™s kitchen and a diet kitchen. 
  

Q: What does that mean? 

  

A: What does that mean? That was maybe in
 the small -- I think it was a p-previous 
restaurant  in -- for the civilians of the 
-- the kitchen was then, for people who had 
diabetes or gall bladder or stuff, to give mo
re of one item that they can have, and less of 
some thing that would be harmful to them. Y
ou know, a -- a diet within the framewor k of 
availability.  
  

Q: So give me an idea of the kind of fo od people will have for breakfast, and then for lunch 
or dinner. And I™m assumi ng now, given your
 explanation, that most people in the 
general population, 90 percent or
 95 percent of the population, 
is eating out of these big 
kitchens. Very few people have apartments and cook for themselves, a m I correct? 
  

A: That was only very later, and -- and these 
were only some  of the privileged people -- 
  

Q: Right. 

  

A: -- who had connections to get a room in one of those -- where the -- where the town 
population was living, they got 
one room per fa mily, and they had a little kerosene 
cooker, or so, and -- 
  

Q: So would you say it was 10 
percent of the population -- 
  

A: No,muchless. 

  

Q: -- or less -- much less than that? 

  

A: Muchless. 

  

Q: Okay. So everybody™s lining up for whatever 
they™re going to eat, 
in their -- in their 
barracks?  
  

A: In the -- except in the -- I -- even -- ev
en in the days when it was snowing, from those 
kettles the food was transferred 
into barrels, taken out and in
 the yard, served. And lines 
were forming, and the -- very soon they ma de
 not ration tickets, but meal tickets, which 
they were printed there so mewhere, and all th
e days of the mo nth on 
it, and there was one 
person, called ordnungs Dienst, somebody who ke
pt order with the band, armband, and 
it™s not a s -- what do you call it, 
it™s -- ma de holes into these -- 
  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
44 
 
 
Q: Right. 
  

A: -- tickets, showing that the person wa s alr
eady there, and to reject him if he came a 
second time. And -- 
  

Q: So if you lost this tick
et, you were in big trouble. 
  

A: Yes. I don™t know what -- what they did if
 -- they wouldn™t let th
em starve, but I don™t 
know what the -- could be only for that month 
that he was starving, but I -- I don™t know. 
  

Q: Right. 

  

A: This -- this organizational 
part, I -- I don™t know. I didn™t -- 
  

Q: And everyone who had a ticket would get some thing? 

  

A: Yeah. 

  

Q: Mm-h m.  

  

A: Now if the person with the ladle at the 
barrel was your friend, you had a chance to get 
like -- you came  with a bigger container, and 
he ma y give you two 
ladles full, or ma y 
reach lower down to get you some of the sm -- mo
re of the solids. This is something that 

has developed -- you know, a barter system
 has developed. There was no money, so 
everyone -- it may not sound nice, but that™s
 what happened, everyone who had access to 
something, like the carpenter had access to 
wood, the cook had access to food, there we re 
workshops where they worked for the Germans,
 so s -- that was a mitzvah to steal from 
the Germans. The other was a little less colorf
ul. The cooks were expected to give their 
fa mily little more, but it was not ethical to st
eal more and get from 
a carpenter a shelf, 
where you put up your shaving stuff, you know?  Or -- 
  

Q: But -- but it happened? 

  

A: Yes, yes. And it happened in -- in every si
ngle departme nt. And what is even less ethical 
was that only those fami lies who had some one 
involved in -- in one of those trades where 

you could schleusse some thing, th
at was called also, to -- th
-they didn™t say steal, they 
said to schleusse it. 
  

Q: That means what? To channel it? To
 -- to go from one person to another? 
  

A: To -- yeah, in Auschwitz
, it was called organizing. 
  

Q: Mm-h m.  

  

A: And here was called, to swipe, or whatever. 
So there was -- there were -- were different 
categor ies and levels of -- of f-feedi
ng, and -- and access to the -- you know, you got 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
45 
 
 
some one working in the -- in the clothes 
warehouse, where the clothe s was that was 
either confiscated upon arrival, 
or if some one died who didn™
t have a fami ly, who wanted 
to retain the goods, went to the warehouse. 
The Germans sent this to Germany for their 
own people, they needed it, or -- while they
 were at war so long. So if some body stole 
their some thing [indecipherable] so where, everywhere somebody had some thing that 
some body else wanted, he bartered for or some
thing he wanted or needed, or didn™t need, 
but got it anyway. Cigarettes were the most
 valuable barter item. The Germans didn™t 
know how well they mean to th
e Jews when they forbid them to s moke. Otherwise they 
would have brought in 
a lot of cigarettes. 
  

Q: So how did you get cigarettes? 

  

A: Si -- through some  of these good gendarme s. 

  

Q: The Czech gendarmes. 

  

A: You pay them, and some  did it even wit
hout paying. They contacted your fa mily in 
Prague, and the aunt or whoever, came  
to the gendarmes home, who lived nearby, 
delivered the stuff, and he brought it in, 
and you pick it up at the gate, or so -- 
  

Q: And why would they do that?  We re they 
getting paid also [indecipherable] bribe? 
  

A: Some did it for payment, and so
me  did it just out of good heart. 
  

Q: And did cigarettes then beco
me  sort of currency inside th
e ghetto, if you had it, you could 
then -- 
  

A: The -- the most valuable currency. 

  

Q: Really? 

  

A: And there were people who gave up their 
food in Auschwitz, people 
died because they -- 
the meager ration they gave for a 
cigarette. Couldn™t stop smoki -- 
  

Q: And this was both me n and wome n, as fa
r as you know?  Or more me n than wome n? 
  

A: I -- not many women we re smoking, I -- 
I -- I don™t know. I co
uldn™t -- I don™t know 
about wome n, but I know me n. 
  

Q: Men. So what -- do you know what mi ght have 
been the -- the -- the biggest currency for 
wome n in terms of this bartering system, or y -- or you don™t know? 
  

A: I don™t think it was lipstick, but I -- I -- I -- 
I don™t know. Maybe my wife will be able to 
tell you. 
  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
46 
 
 
Q: Uh-huh. We ll, we™ll ask her tomorrow. So w
ould you consider this a kind of black ma r ket 
system as well, or not? 
  
A: Just barter -- barter -- 

  

Q: Justbartering. 

  

A: -- barter economy. Bartered with -- 
with whatever you had, 
you brought with you, and 
didn™t use it, and some body else wanted it. All things that you -- 
  

Q: Right. 

  

A: -- disappropriated some where where you had access to. 

  

Q: Did you smoke? 

  

A: No. 

  

Q: Really? 

  

A: I don™t reme mber in which grade, kids dra
gged me  into the bathroom in school, I was a 
young kid still, and gave me  a puff of a cigare
tte, and I coughed so much that I never 
touched it again. So -- 
  

Q: So did that mean that you didn™t have access, or did you some ti me s get cigarettes and use 
it to get other things? 
  

A: No, I never got cigarettes, and I never -- I 
-- I had the -- I had some
 of the food that I 
could use, and I tell you how I used it. We  ar
e already far ahead, and I wanted also to 
bring out my -- the initi -- the beginning a
nd impact of Schacter on the whole camp, and 
on me  personally. 
  

Q: Well, we will do that. I --  I stil
l wanted to stay with the kitche
ns for a little bit, if that  was 
okay. 
  

A: Yeah, no, but that started -- he 
came  in December of ™41, so -- 

  

Q: So just a few weeks after you? 

  

A: -- we did -- we didn™t have to go back. 

  

Q: Uh-huh. Am I correct to say that your fi
rst roomma te was a lawyer of some  kind?  
  

A: Yeah. 

  

Q: Introduced you to various 
people. Was there a lawyer? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
47 
 
 
  
A: How do -- yeah, yeah, how do you -- 

  

Q: There was an interview that you did. 

  

A: You -- you have your own -- 

  

Q: Spies. 

  

A: -- Intelligence network? 

  

Q: Yes. I think we have to stop th
e tape, but we™re going to start -- 
  

A: I couldn™t find anybody of his fa mily. 

  

Q: Mm.  

  

A: His wife was a little bit taking advantage. Sh
e -- she bartered with 
-- with giving favors to 
me n. 
  

Q: Uh-huh. All right, we
™ll stop the tape now.

Q: Edgar, before we get on to your roomma tes,
 and -- and your relationship with Schacter, I 
wanted to ask you about what kind of f
ood was -- was served. I mean, it™s a little 
overwhelming for anybody to think of thousands of people being cooked for, under these 

conditions especially. 
  

A: That™s why I tried to introduce Schacter
, because we have some thing in common. 

  

Q: Mm.  

  

A: [coughs] Sorry. He -- I consid
er him a psychologist without 
a certificate, or without a 
diploma. He  recognized the -- and 
I™ll come  to your question -- 
  

Q: Yes. 

  

A: -- he recognized imme di ately upon his arrival,
 the -- that the prison me ntality can sink 
into the people™s mi nd. That when he came, wh
e n the gates were still closed, and he got 

everybody together and encouraged them to 
sing. And most of the songs were Czech 
popular songs, which most of people knew. And it had a tremendous i mpact on 

everybody, not just during the time  you were si
nging, and gathers others who were not 
singing, were sitting there and 
listening, to the po
int that not just that hour, hour and a 
half, you forgot every -- that 
the reality of your actual ci
rcumstances, but you took with 
you a little bit of -- 
like a care package, a -- a spiritual 
care package to help you carry on 
i-in -- for the -- until the ne
xt time  when we sing. 
  
Q: So this was -- he did this in th
e Sudeten barrack when you first came -- 
  
A: The Sudeten in the baseme nt, and not only 
that, I me ntioned to you that the gates were 
closed, and the wome n were in another 
barracks. I don™t know how he managed, he 
appeared in the wome n™ s barracks, and did 
the same with the women, with the same 
beneficial impact. So I -- why I represented 
him before answering your question, I knew 
that the Czechs lived through 
their stomach. Even now, this family, when they come to 
visit, the sister-in-law and the nephews and ni
eces, food is so meaningful, they come  into 
the house, and they go right, pick up the cove
rs of the pots and -- and then pinch here, 
and pinch there. I tried with 
those ingredients we had, to ma
ke food that™s ma inly a Czech 
-- Czech food. Dumplings -- we had flour. I 
don™tknow how, on my 
request, yeast came  
into the camp, and we made dumplings, and from
 this so-called coffee, that was a dark 
grain, nothing to do with coffee,
 but it was dark and looked li
ke it, and we cooked it, and 
let it cool, and at the right temperature, if
 you put in some  margarine and whipped it, it 
didn™t dissolve completely, and it -- you know it 
didn™t melt. It stayed
 like little dots of 
ma r -- people thought that™s the 
best sauce on a dumpling they 
ever ate. And some  people 
asked after the war, said, could you ma ke it for me ?  
  

Q: Really? 

  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
49 
 
 
A: So this -- in this way I tried to accommodate
 or improve their me ntal state with providing 
food that is close to the C
zech stomach. And I say Czech be
cause these people were first 
Czechs, and then they were Jews, then they 
were -- if not they, then somebody else made 
them aware that they are Jews. 
  
Q: Okay. 

  

A: So in this wa y I me ntion Schacter first, because  in his way he did work on the Czech 
mi nd, and I worked on the Czech stomachs. 
  

Q: But I -- I™m still not comple
tely clear on once the kitchens were going in all the different 
barracks, and I assume that all the barra
cks had their own kitchen, am I correct? 
  

A: Yeah, yeah. And then there was -- a
nd from the nearby neighborhood of those houses 
where the origin population lived, nearest to 
each barrack, those people we re designated 
to this particular barrack. 
  

Q: Right,uh-huh. 

  

A: And then the further -- located further awa
y, for those -- sorry, for those a kitchen was 
built in -- on the ma in road, and that was onl
y to be delivered to another location, central 
location where those able of walking could co
me  to. And from that 
kitchen also, the ones 
who couldn™t come  were supplied like m
eals on wheels, Terezín styl e. So -- 
  

Q: You mean, the elderly who couldn™t go -- 

  
A: Yeah. 
  

Q: -- or the people who were 
disabled, who couldn™t go. So d-
do you think people starved in 
Terezín? 
  

A: Those who had no connection t
o, or anything to barter with, 
or had some thing but were in 
the attic and couldn™t get down and mi ngle, those 
really -- it was -- it™s not starving on the 
street falling down, but they, of ma lnutrition, 
lack of vitami ns a
nd -- and s -- lack of 
appropriate amounts of food, even if it wasn
™t the right food, caused them to -- ma de 
them susceptible to diseases and we had the 
best doctors, all the doctors were there. 
There was a operating room that was brought in
 from a Jewish hospital in Prague. And if 
you only need a doctor™s attention, you had 
the best attention, 
but if you needed 
me dication, you were [indecipherable]. I 
had my hernia operated there. 
  

Q: Really? 

  

A: And ne -- didn™t need anything else excep
t a surgeon™s in
tervention. And I healed, and 
that was okay. But if you had some thing, I 
don™t know, asthma , that they gave you -- 
inhale some  vapors, hot water 
or so, hot water vapors, but 
ther e was really
 no me dication 
that -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
50 
 
 
  
Q: Did they put you -- they must have put you to
 sleep with something, did they have ether? 
  

A: I think -- yeah, it 
was, it was ether. 
  

Q: But no painkillers for after? 

  

A: No. I didn™t any. 

  

Q: You didn™t need it. 

  

A: No. 

  

Q: So there were not people who were lying dead
 on the street, the way they were in other -- 
in other ghettos, as far as you knew? 
  

A: No, no. That -- they were dying 
in the -- in that -- in the in
firmary, or -- or where they 
lived, but it was ma ybe not direct starving, 
but starvation induced 
susceptibility to 
diseases which put them in pneumonia. Dysent
ery -- dysentery killed the most people.  
  

Q: But you have very few toilets. You had th 
-- at the -- as far as I know, at one time the 
most was about 50,000 people. 
  

A: Yeah. 

  

Q: But there™s some thing like 900 or a thousand toilets available. So most people -- 
  
A: I don™t -- I don™t think 
there were that ma ny. Th 
- -  in the barracks --  
  

Q: You think there were fewer? 

  

A: -- in the barracks -- in the military barracks we
re not latrines, but the soldiers had there a 
wall of urinals, and then what do you call it, 
those booth or separations with a toilet. And 
there were people standing in line. In some  
areas, where it was necessary, some  latrines 
were built. And I don™t know how they were 
emptied, and the stuff carried away, or 
sanitized I think, with some -- some  carc -- it™s
 calcium, but it™s not calcium like you take 
for your bones, it™s -- I don™t 
know how it is particular -- 
  

Q: Lime , of some  --  

  

A: L-Lime. Oh, isn™t she wonderful, 
lime. What would 
I do without you? 
  

Q: I don™t know. 

  

A: So -- but still, it was dysenter -- Hana
™s grandparents, both of them -- no, was 
grandmother and -- and this brother of her 
grandfather came, he -- he was 80 years old 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
51 
 
 
and he worked as a lumberjack, he was splitt
ing wood for the -- starting the fires in those 
kettles. And there was a [indecipherable] six 
weeks later he wa s gone, with diarrhea -- the 
dysentery. 
  
Q: Because they had nothing. 

  

A: Dehydration, you know. 

  

Q: Now, access to water also, was -- was very di
fficult, yes?  People couldn™t wash easily, or 
-- and drink water, or am I [indecipherable] 
  

A: I don™t know how -- you know, in those houses
 and apartme nts of the town population, 
these were not apartments with two or th
ree bathrooms that -- nobody had two bathrooms 
except some super rich people in their villas
. But here, they -- they must have had -- 
possibly, problems. But in the militar y barracks, there were these -- was these rows of 

one huge trough or two in the mi ddl
e of pipe, water pipe, with -- 
  

Q: Withfaucets? 

  

A: -- with faucets along. And I have a picture 
at home of one of those ladies™ washrooms. 
  

Q: So Hannover had it?  Sudeten? 

  

A: All the bar --  all the barracks -- 

  

Q: [indecipherable] they all had it. 
  
A: -- all the military barr acks had washrooms. But cold water only. 

  

Q: Right. 

  

A: Which in winter was not very pleasant, but -- 

  

Q: When you said that you had -- your fi rst r
oomma te was a lawyer, I don™t know what his 
name  was, what does that mean whe n you sa
y roomma te?  Were you ac
tually living in a -- 
in a separate room?   
  

A: I told you I was a big shot. 
In eight -- with 18 or 19 year
s, and I had -- 
and I don™t know 
how and where I got it. Could be
 -- it could have been a part
 of barter result that some  
carpenter put a -- a few boards up, separated a 
bigger -- a smaller room
 fr om the rest of 
the big room, and his wife -- in the Ha mbur
ger was a jail for women. I didn™t mention yet 
that there was a -- the gendarmes was -- were
 watching outside, and inside was a ghetto 

police, established by the Council of Elders a
nd they looked like -- under the cap and the 
-- and the yellow armband identifying them as a police. 
  

Q: Were they in uniform?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
52 
 
 
  
A: They had some  -- they wore black -- I don™
t know, but everyone had exactly the same . 
But you could recognize that he™s of the pol
ice formation. The -- how did we get to the 
police? 
  

Q: Well, I™m asking you about the lawyer. 

  

A: The lawyer, yeah, yeah. 

  

Q: So internally there™s -- there™
s ghetto police, and his wife --  
  

A: --okay. 

  

Q: -- you said some thing -- 

  

A: That™s from the wife we came to the police. 

  

Q: But also you said some thing about the wife in
 the last tape. Which was that she seemed to 
have slept around. 
  

A: Did I say that? 

  

Q: Well, you didn™t use those words, 
but that™s what you were implying. 
  

A: Yeah, okay. This is how she -- I think this is
 how she got the -- eith
er head of the -- the 
jail mi stress, or chai -- jail warden in the 
Dresner. And the jail was the -- when -- it wa s 
used by the military, the barracks, there was 
a guard room, and there was another room 
where they rested if they -- between shifts, 
or between the guard dut
ies. And there was a -
- they put up a [indecipherable] a
nd there was a temporary holding jail. 
  

Q: Forwo me n? 

  

A: For wome n. And I don™t know
 why wome n wer e  being -- 
  

Q: You don™t know? 

  

A: -- jailed. No.  

  

Q: Uh-huh. 

  

A: My mother was jailed, but that  was by the Germans. And that was in the Ko mmandatur, 
which was in a bank building and down where 
the vaults were, they had the jails.  
  

Q: But in ma le barracks they would also
 have jails for Jewish men, if they -- 
  

A: I think so, I -- I was -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
53 
 
 
  
Q: Uh-huh. 

  

A: -- held in one at the mo me nt
 of weakness. I -- just for th
e short time  we know each other 
you must know I™m a ve ry easy going person. And I -- I have tremendous amount of 

patience. But when it come s to the point wh
ere I can no longer be patient, I can be a 
murderer. I can kill. So, I -- I 
totally lose presence of mi nd, and just instinct. There we re 

two very young SS me n, they would de -- ev
erybody called them kindergarten. And they 
were driving the tractor s that were pulling the 
-- the heavy loads, so they were -- because 

the Jews, they didn™t want to 
entrust a Jew, that di stract
s the Jews. And one day they 
come  in front of the Hamburger. There™san old ma n going, and one of them -- I -- he 

didn™t see them, he didn™t take his hat off, or
 what ever, and they we
nt in and started to 
unload on him, with hitting. I went with a 
friend, I tore loose, 
and I knocked them both 
down to the ground. A norma l person wouldn™t do 
that, but that™s the condition I get in 

when it snaps. And they starte
d to shoot, but they were drunk,
 and it didn™t help. So they 
get the police, grab me in, pull me into thei
r guard room, and the ot
her guy went to the 
head of the Council of Elders 
to tell him about it. And he 
cleaned it up, because those two 
were drunk and shouldn™t have been there.
 So some how I got away. I don™t know how, 

because nobody attacks SS me n unpunished. So
 you asked the jail, and I went to 
sideways in saying I was in th
ere. So he was -- he knew about
 it and he suffered by it, and 
we consoled each other. And -- 
  

Q: Let me -- I --  I said something s -- a little 
bit coarsely, and I didn™t mean to say it that 
way, when I said that this lawyer™s wife
 was -- was sleeping around. And what I really 
mean to ask -- 
  
A: But that™s another way of saying it. 
  

Q: It is another way, but I -- but
 I think it™s a more s -- s -- it™s more serious than that. You 
know, when you were saying that me n were smok
ing, so they could easily use cigarettes 
as a way to barter, is it possi
ble that wome n had a currency 
that became very significant 
in Theresienstadt, name ly sex. 
  

A: Could have been there, not ma ny, but under 
those conditions, and not knowing transports 
have -- were lea -- were leaving, and you 
don™t know where they go, or -- or what™s 
happening. So the level of morality sa nk a little, and people wanted to enjoy as much as 

they could, and as long as they could. And you di d not have to be in love just to perform 

and enjoy. So I don™t know whether, or how 
ma ny, if so, would have used this as a 
currency. 
  

Q: But in any way it™s very complicated, becau
se for some -- for some people, their life 
force is such that before they die, they want
 to have affection, and sex. For others it may 
be using it as a currency, it woul
d be hard to know [indecipherable] 
  

A: I think most of it was just sex. 

  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
54 
 
 
Q: Foritsel f. 
  

A: As long as -- as long as
 you™re here, you know you -- there are some  certain rooms, or 
you had the roomma te, you tell him get out of he
re, and so -- but I think it was very little. 

Well, there were young people who -- who -- Hana
™s sister got -- Hana™s brother ma de a 
very serious acquaintance, and before -- on 
the day he was deported, in the morning, he 
married this girl. So there™s a 
chance that they -- they can 
go together and she wouldn™t -- 
her supervisor wouldn™t let her go, because 
she worked in the agriculture, which was 
bringing in harvest for the Germans. The agri
culture was not for the ghetto, that was for 
the Germans. So the -- these are the -- sure, 
there were instances where people fell in love 
with each other, or shared the -- the sorrow,
 which then became  bearable through nice 
companionship. But there was also just this 
free -- free life before. It ma y not be again.  
  

Q: Was this shocking to you at the time? 

  

A: No, it was enlightening to me . 

  

Q: It was enlightening to you. True, yeah? 

  

A: Pardon? 

  

Q: Yeah, yeah -- you -- you mean that, this is not just a -- 

  

A: No, no, no.  

  

Q: Yeah. So this was a learning experience in some  way? 
  
A: You™re asking too ma ny 
questions, I already my - -  
  

Q: That™s my job 

  

A: -- I had already my appr enticeship before I 
went to -- to Terezín. But there, yes, and it 
was not the barter, it was mutual driv
e to enjoy as much as possible -- 
  

Q: Right,right. 

  

A: -- under the given circumstances, 
which were not very enjoyable. 
  

Q: Right. Did -- do you think that people in Te
rezín after ™40 -- after 
™42, when -- there must 
be rumors of what™s going on, at least, that
 people have a sense 
that if they™re sent, 
they™re not going to return?  Y -- I mea
n, and are people afraid, or they s -- 
  

A: They may not return to Terezín -- 

  

Q: Uh-huh. 

  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
55 
 
 
A: -- but they ma y go to a nother camp  and bu
ild, and -- and create a new ghetto, or a new 
labor -- labor camp, and -- and the Germans kept 
this ver -- that was the best kept secret. 
For instance, they ordered, 
for one time , a thousand me n, age 18 to 55, but only me n t- 
transpor t, that they go some where to build a 
new labor camp. And the next transport, the 
wives of those me n were encouraged to vol
unteer so they can be with their me n, and 
they™re never -- they were ne
ver together, because in Ausc
hwitz, the me n went one side, 
the wome n t he other, and there were me n w
ho went to the right and to the left, and 
women who went to the right a
nd the left. So they never were
 together again. But it gave 
an impression in the ghetto that they go so
me where, and they going 
to be together, and 
it™s not so bad. 
  

Q: So i -- in -- at the end of ™
41 - ™42 - ™43, you have no suspicion. 
  

A: Nobody had, even afterwards. 

  

Q: No -- afterw -- 

  

A: And when -- when the train opened in Ausc
hwitz, and I saw what Arbeit ma cht frei in 
Auschwitz, I still did not believe what it is. 
  

Q: Right. 

  

A: I think we™l l get ther e in -- in more detail -- 

  

Q: [indecipherable] 

  
A: -- when --  
  

Q: Right. 

  

A: -- when we get to Auschwitz. 

  

Q: Yes. So this lawyer, you reme mber his name ?  

  

A: Yeah. 

  

Q: What is his name ?  

  

A: His name  was Otto Freund. 

  

Q: Freund? 

  

A: Freund was a friend. 

  

Q: Mm-h m.  

  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
56 
 
 
A: And he -- already, before he came to Ter
ezín, he  Czechisized it because he  thought he 
will function better as a lawyer
 under a Czech name , and spelled it f-a -- F-r-a-j-t, Frajt. 
  
Q: Really? 

  

A: Frajt. That ™s a -- that™s not a Jewish name, so -- 

  

Q: And what kind of a guy was he, was he -- 

  

A: Pardon? 

  

Q: What kind of a person was he? 

  

A: A very nice, mild ma nne red, wonderful 
guy. And I think he suffered knowing what™s 
happening with his wife, and I think he had no in
fluence, or didn™t want
 to interfere. He 
just [indecipherable] tolerated 
it, and he didn™t come  back, an
d I inquired after the war if 
there are any relatives of 
his, and couldn™t find anybody. 
  

Q: And is it the case that he knew artists andmusicians and that he introduced you to these 
people, or is that
 not a connection? 
  

A: This was parallel. He knew some , and also 
I have recognized that 
the -- through him, that 
those -- first the artists, the painters, and th
en about the musicians, that they had a job 
assigned during the day, the artists we re in 
-- there was a technical office, technical 
bureau where the artists drew the blue prints fo
r the engineers and the -- the techni cians, 
and ma de poster f -- propaganda posters for the Ge rmans. And in -- at night, they were 
drawing the -- ma king the drawings of the real
 life in Terezín, which you ma y have seen -
- mainly there™s a book, and more books than
 one. And they smuggled some  of that 
through these gendarmes. And there was also,in the agriculture departme nt, they had 
horses that were drawing -- pul
ling the -- the carts, and the 
horses produced ma nure, and 
they took that ma nure out, and underneath, th
ey smuggled out lette
rs, and -- and these 
posters, and so -- so some  of those, I don™
t know which way they went out, and some  
were found in Switzerland. 
  

Q: And these were taken out by the sh -- the Czech ge ndarmes, knowingly?  

  

A: No, I -- no, the -- the German
s found those in Switzerland. 
  

Q: Isee. 

  

A: And of course, all the painters wereimmediately arrested. Some  wound o n -- wound up 
on the small fortress, and some went dire
ctly to Auschwitz. And only one of them 
survived, it was Haas. 
  

Q: LeoHaas. 

  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
57 
 
 
A: Leo Haas -- 
  

Q: Yeah. 

  

A: -- and I don™t know that Fr
itta had this three year old child with him, on the small 
fortress. He was then deported fr om the fortress,
 and his wife died insi de, fr om illness, at 
the fortress, and Haas and his wife took care 
of this three year 
old boy, and I don™t know 
how, in the small fortress, a boy could surviv
e. Anyway -- and he calls hims elf Toma s 
Haas Fritta. Not even fr it 
-- not even Dalzig, Fritta. 
  

Q: Uh-huh, takes the first name , the first nickname . 

  

A: Fritta-- 

  

Q: No, Fritta™s the last name. 

  

A: Fritta was Fritz Dalzig, and he
 signed his drawings as Fritta. 
  

Q: Yeah,Fritta. 

  

A: And-- 

  

Q: And that was called the painter™s affair
, when they were arrested, is that not 
[indecipherable] 
  

A: Yup. And Haas survived, because they recogniz
ed his capabilities, that can be utilized in 
a workshop, where counterfeit Amer ican and Br
itish money was printed, with which the 
Germans paid their spies in those countries. 
  

Q: Mm-hm. We™re going to 
have to stop the tape. 
  

A: Yeah, I know, I saw -- 

  

Q: Yousaw.

Tape #6 
  
Q: When you were rooming with Frajt, th
e lawyer, right -- what™s his first name ?  
  

A: Otto. 

  

Q: Otto Frajt. [indecipherable] 

  

A: Truly Czech it™s Ota. 

  

Q: Ota? 

  

A: O-t-a. 

  

Q: O-t-a. 

  

A: Otto in Czech is O-t-a. 

  

Q: Okay. So he, as an older person, cause he
™s an established lawyer, can introduce you to 
some  of the people who were artists and pa
inters, who were working -- and they were 
working in Magdeburg, am I correct
? Is that  where they™re --  
  

A: No. 

  

Q: No. 

  
A: There was -- some  was in Magdeburg, but th
ere was -- also was a technical office -- I™ve 
never seen it, that was not 
in a barrack, that was -- 
  
Q: I -- I see. 

  

A: -- or it was a -- a specially constr
ucted building, I™m not sure that -- 

  

Q: But is it -- is it through him that you me t these -- 

  

A: Through him de -- I found out that thes
e people actually doing double duty, and the 
second duty was even a more important one th
an the first one. So 
I stealed some  extra 
food to them. And this is how we establishe
d a relationship, and I 
still don™t want to 
create an idea that they 
were crazy about me , be cause I was nobody compared to them, 
these were established pe ople. That it could 
have been because of giving them some extra 
food. 
  

Q: And why did you decide to give them extra food? 

  

A: Because a -- 

  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
59 
 
 
Q: Because of what they were doing? 
  

A: -- the hard laborers got extra, the kids got
 extra, and there were people comi ng home  
from --from their eight or nine or 10 hours j
ob, and sit down and starte
d to draw till late 
into the night, what I tho
ught was important ma terial for the future. And I didn™t know 
even that it™s being exported. So I had so
me  -- as I said, sa -- additional emergency 
rations. 
  

Q: And did you -- 

  

A: And through Schacter I me t the composers. 
So I did the same  for them, be cause they 
were sitting at night, 
and composing, writing. 
  

Q: Did you bring the food to the painte
rs and to the composers, yourself? 
  

A: Yeah. 

  

Q: And -- and this was dangerous for you, 
if you were caught. 
Am I right, or not? 
  

A: I -- I don™t think it -- it would have messed 
up -- would have messed me up, but it wasn™t 
dangerous, because the Germans were not inside the ghetto. There were no guards inside, 

except for those dru -- two drunk kids. But -- 
and there were no gendarmes inside, just 
the ghetto police. And they didn™t 
suspect, or -- you carry some thing. 
  

Q: So they wouldn™t necessa rily have checked anything? 

  
A: No, no. It wasn™t dangerous what I did, it 
was, I said, ma ybe inappropriate from the 
general point of view, favoring some  individuals, but there were 
[indecipherable] six, 
seven painters. 
  
Q: So would you -- you go to where they were wo
rking at night, and give them the food at 
night, do you reme mber ? 
  

A: Some  of them were living at very close qua
rters, cause -- not far 
from one another, and 
yes, you we -- the answer is yes. 
  

Q: So you e -- 

  

A: The short answer. 

  

Q: It is. But you™d go at night, would you c
ook the food special, or would you simply take 
what was already there? 
  

A: No, no, no, that was -- that was stuff th
at -- that was -- I di
dn™t cook special. 
  

Q: And would you stay -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
60 
 
 
  
A: There was nothing to cook special, ther
e were only the big kettles, you know? 
  

Q: Right. Woul d you stay with them, or would you -- 

  

A: Yeah, I -- there were evenings when I st
ayed with them, but most evenings I spent 
singing with Schacter. 
  

Q: In the choi r? 

  

A: Yeah, we had almost ev
ery night the rehearsal. 

  

Q: And was this almost from the beginning? 

  

A: The -- from the beginning was the -- 

  

Q: When he came in December? 

  

A: -- the singing in those base
me nts after. And then, after J
une ™42, when people could move 
fr eely, he assembled the men and the women together in the basement of the military 

headquarters near -- on the right of the church. 
  

Q: Uh-huh,right. 

  

A: And that was during the day, a carpenter 
shop, and at night we put up some  boards like 
this, and the choir stood there and was singing 
and rehearsing. As soon as we could get 
together, he came up, he had one score of ﬁThe
 Bartered Bride,ﬂ as a very popular Czech 
opera, and started to study with us. The 
singers had nothing to 
look at. There was no 
written music, there were no way of 
copying, and no time to copy, and not enough 
qualified people to copy music. So we learned by rote. 
  

Q: So would he sing? 

  

A: No. 

  

Q: How -- how would you do it?  P -- there was a piano? 

  

A: First there was a harmonium in -- there was 
a -- there were certain defi -- di fferent de -- 
work details, one of them was move rs who 
have moved heavy loads, really where they 
were needed, when on the town square, the te
nts and the barracks weren™t up, where more 
industry roo -- projects were 
[indecipherable] production was 
kept. So these people we re 
carrying, then loading the trucks with the st
uff that was assembled. And they were also 
moving the German -- for the Germans when they -- when so me  was called off, and the 

new officer came, the SS or so. He was mo 
-- they were mo ving thei r furniture and the 
luggage, and so. And they discovered some wh
ere in the room, a old harmonium. So one 
night they, when it was dark, no mo on, they 
brought the harmonium to that baseme nt. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
61 
 
 
And first we were playing -- Schacter was 
playing the harmonium, and then they found a 
piano without legs, and also brought it in, a
nd the carpent ers made some l egs. Until they 
ma de the legs and fastened them, th
e piano was standi
ng on three crates. 
  
Q: And this was a grand piano? 

  

A: Yeah. 

  

Q: Yeah. What™s a harmonium?  What does it look like? 

  

A: Like a -- like a -- we 
call it in church, the -- 
  

Q: Organ? 

  

A: Organ. 

  

Q: A s mall -- 

  

A: A s mall organ, not with pipes, but you had to pump -- 

  

Q: With your fe et. 

  

A: -- the air -- 

  

Q: Right. 

  
A: -- into th -- the pipes were inside the harmonium. 
  

Q: We -- we -- let me  go back a little bit. 
Ho -- how was it that y
ou me t Schacter? Did you 
meet hi m when he came into the Sudeten barrack? 
  

A: No, I -- I was in the crowd of
 -- of a ll the others who went
 to sing with him, whom he 
encouraged to sing. 
  

Q: And why did you do that?  You hadn™t had 
much singing as a kid. What -- what -- 
  

A: I -- at the last three or four months in 
Prague, before I went to -- you know, this was a 
lunch job, this -- the Jewi sh communities had 
free evenings, fi rst time. I -- I joined a 
barbershop quartet. 
  

Q: Really? 

  

A: As a bass. And we were singing. I don™t th
ink we were singing for money, we were 
singing I think only for pleasure.
 And so I liked singing, and so
 I definitely volunteered to 
participat e. 
  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
62 
 
 
Q: Right, right. But you had been
 singing more popular music, 
and now with Schacter, after 
the popular Czech songs, seeing ﬁThe  Bartered Brideﬂ -- 
  
A: Well ﬁThe Bartered Brideﬂ is 
-- is a Czech popular opera -- 
  

Q: Uh-huh. 

  

A: -- and almos t  everybody knows certain parts of
 it, and it wasn™t di
fficult to learn the 
Czech. I -- I had a good ear, and a good voice, 
so it wasn™t difficult to learn, once it was 
played in -- on the piano, to follow through on the -- 
  

Q: The -- the lead singers, were these -- there 
are a lot of professiona
l artists, singers in 
Terezín, were the lead singers more professional people, people who [indecipherable]  
  

A: When you say lead singers, I don™t know 
what you mean. There we
re -- there were -- 
  

Q: Soloists. 

  

A: -- soloists, yeah. 

  

Q: Soloists. 

  

A: They were from the Czech National Opera, 
and from the Vienna Opera, and later even 
fr om the Berlin opera. 
  

Q: Right. So you -- 
  
A: They brought in German Jews as well, to Terezín. 

  

Q: Uh-huh. So you were in the -- in the choir? 

  

A: Yeah, only in the choir. 

  

Q: Right. 

  

A: [inaudible] 

  

Q: And what was he like in rehearsal? 

  

A: Schacter? 
  
Q: Yeah. 

  

A: Schacter is a -- was a lova ble, pleasant person, until he  sat behind the pi ano, then he 
became a tyrant. You were not allowe d to look 
at the guy next  to you, or even at the girl 
next to you. You were not allowed to whisper.
 You had to focus on his eyes, because he 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
63 
 
 
was conducting with his eyes, the hands on the 
-- on the keys, and his eyes were directing 
the music. And if he noticed you did -- you™re 
not attentive, if -- 
once he yelled at you, 
the second time  he threw you out. 
  
Q: Really? 

  

A: Yeah. 

  

Q: So he -- 

  

A: And -- and -- 

  

Q: -- treated this very professionally? 

  

A: -- and nee -- nobody mi nded it, ev
erybody wanted to be part of
 it. He did nev -- he never 
had to advertise, people were fl ocking to him, he had the luxury of auditioning peoples.  
  

Q: And w-was he auditioning people for the choir? 

  

A: Yeah, for the choir, yes. 

  

Q: So were there people with good voices in the choir, tha -- from what you reme mber? 

  

A: Yeah, he -- he -- he ma kes sure you -- 
he had the unlimited amount of people were 
comi ng to him, who wanted to participate.  
  
Q: And how many people ended up in the 
choir? I know that there were -- 
  
A: I don™t know how ma ny were doing these i
ndividual opera performa nces, but I know for 
the Requiem there were 150. He started anot
he r Czech opera, and then when German 

Jews came, and these we re -- the German Jews they were not -- there were very few 

young people, very few. Very few young mi ddl
e class, these were older, upper mi ddle 
class, and then the -- the prominent ones, 
the old ones who fought in World Wa r I, with 

whom the German played a cruel game. They
 pr omised them -- or told them, leave 
everything here, your furnitu
re, your money, your belongings
, the -- the glass in the 
showcase. We are bringing you to a spa wh
ere you will have  no worry. You will have 
ma id service, and room s e rvice, and food 
service, and laundry service. And these guys, 

after observing three or four or five years, 
how the Germans treat -- how the Nazis treated 
the German Jews in Germany, still be lieve d the officer™s word. The -- the reason that they 

came, at a time when the ba
rracks, and the houses of the 
town population were already 
filled, and the only place for them was in the 
attics of the barracks. They will put st raw 
ma ttresses on the floor, and you can imagine the old people going down to the floor to lay 

down to sleep, and even worse to get up to 
sleep. And if you have heard about it, older 
people have to go to the bathroom more ofte
n. So first to get up, and then climb over -- I 
guess these mattresses were one 
next to the other, to accommodate as many as possible, 
climb over the people with a dim light, because the light  was di m so the rest  can sl eep. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
64 
 
 
And go down a flight of stairs, and then still 
the bathroom was not next to the stairs, still 
go on. And if they couldn™t hold it, I don™t have
 to describe you the 
hygienic and sanitary 
conditions that have develope
d, which contributed to the a
cce -- accelerated death rate. 
And also, many of them lost will to live
. They were de -- they were deceived, 
heartbroken by the German officers and -- to wh
om they had so much trust. And so ma ny 
suicides among them, a mong the old people. A
nd then, as I said, quick deterioration 
through lack of sanitation a
nd -- and cleanliness, and that
 was a very poor sight. But 
Schacter imme diately took his Czech Jews, and 
started to study ﬁMarri
age of Figaro,ﬂ for 
the same  purpose, to pep up that -- those Ge
rman prisoners. And ﬁMagic Fl ute,ﬂ and the 
Czech singers were s -- most of
 the Czechs spoke German, because not only at the -- at 
the border area, but most Czechs had frequent
 use for the German language. So German 
was pretty used among the Czech Jews.  
  

Q: And these were concert versions of the operas? 

  

A: Concert versions, yeah -- no, no costumes, no. 

  

Q: [indecipherable]. And what did you use when
 you performe d?  Wa s that piano that had 
been given legs -- 
  

A: Just the pi ano. 

  

Q: Just the pi ano. 

  

A: Just the pi ano. 

  
Q: Now, I™ m going to go off this topic for ju
st a second, because you me ntioned that the old 
German Jews often committed su -- ma ny committed suicide. How did they commit 
suicide?  Did they jump out of windows? 
  

A: A window, yeah. And some  ma y have had the 
-- the -- taken a exces
sive dose of sleeping 
pills, or  whatever they still br ought with them. Th
ey deterior ated a very rapid fa -- rate.  
  

Q: Di -- wi -- I want to cont
inue o-on your relationship and the work with Schacter, but I 
also wanted to ask you, there were -- ther
e were orchestras in Terezín, there are 
composers, there are other conductors, yes? 
  

A: Okay. 

  

Q: So that there is a lot going on. Am I correct? 

  

A: How did it come  about?  Now there is a 
-- a saying going around, and you must have 
heard it, that the Germans picked Theresienstadt  
as a town to show off with. It wasn™t that 
way. I me ntioned it among other things in thei
r home town, they had to turn in their 
musical instrume nts, and some  didn™t. And some even had the chutzpah, people who will 

read this ma y know wha t  that means, had th
e guts to bring those ins -- smuggle those 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
65 
 
 
instrume nts with i -- within those 110 pounds
, instead of food and clothing, into Terezín, 
because they were so -- such ardent  musician
s, amateurs and professionals, who loved to 
play, and because everybody thought it™s going 
to be over in six months. I spoke about 
the optimism. When the six months were over,
 they gave themselves another six months. 
So they played in attics, and in cellars, to 
stay in shape for when they come  out, they 
should be in the same performance level as
 they came  in. And although there are no -- 
were no Germans in the ghetto, nothing escaped
 them, they found out. And now a terrific 
fright and concern gripped everyone in 
the ghetto, because the Germans -- a few 
Germans ke pt all these thousands of Jews
 in check by imposing corrective punishme nt. 
So what that means, were two kinds, either right
 away into the transpor t, with --  and these 
people were ma rked, when they were in the 
transport, in Auschwitz they know who they 

are, and they select them -- direct them to
 the appropriate side, 
punishing side, or the 
small fortress. So nobody wanted to involve thei
r wife, parents, children, siblings in such 
a punishme nt, so there was a big concern. The 
head of the Council of Elders, Edelstein 
told the camp commander why -- I mean, not 
in this exact wording, I™m paraphrasing, 
why would you punish these few people?  Look 
at the amount of talent you have 
accumulated here, why don™t you think of a progr
am where you can utilize them to show 
the world how well you treat the Jews ?  That™s 
when this idea came into being. It was not 
a preconceive d idea with the Germans before
 the ghetto was created. So not only were 
these Jews not punished, and could retain th
eir instrume nts, more instrume nts were 
brought in from Prague, and before they dete
rmi ned how they are going to do -- show the 
world how well they treat the Jews, they 
already divide -- devi
sed a beautification 
program in anticipation of that, and a free tim
e activities departme nt was created. And in 
the frame of this orchestras -- jazz ha s just 
come  to -- to Europe from United States, so 
we had a five me mber -- what is it called?  
Ghetto swingers. Ghetto swingers jazz team. 

Then there were the two musicians who played
 in the café. One of the m was my cousin, 
the accordionist, he was a piano and accor -- but
 there he  played the accordion, and one 
was a violinist. And -- and ot
her of the quartets, and unbelievable, not the Germans, a nd 
not the Council of Elders could have imagin
ed what™s getting news there. And not only 
music, there were theaters -- there were all the actors fr om -- fr om all these towns. The 

theater, cabaret, those are very popular because 
they were throwing these verbal da rts at 
the Germans, in Czech language. Maybe some  even in German, I don™t know about those. 

And this was very uplifting, and 
very helping in -- in really
 reducing the anxieties of the 
life that was destined for us. There were l
ectures. There were 1240 
lectures on different 
subjects. This is based on the notes from that
 -- that they found fr om that fr ee activity --  
free time activity list, by prof
essors, chemists, biologists, rabbis. Nobody went to the 
temple, but they went ther e to listen to th
e rabbi. And people w
ho had no interest in 
chemistry and so, went to j -- just to get di
versification, and -- a
nd getting away from -- 
from this dread life of ghetto. By the way, th
ey called -- you know, Terezín in German is 
Theresienstadt, and the Nazis told these 
prominent people they go to Theresienbath, 
which is a Theresien spa. I didn™t say it when 
we were on the subject. So it is an unbe -- 
there was more -- more of these cultural activities per capita than in New York or -- or  

anywhere else, in a day. And people after wo
rk went, and they -- they shortened their 
sleeping time, because they were not really st
rong with the -- with the food they were 
getting, and I don™t take blame for it. I just 
did what was -- we  had. But it was -- it was 

unbelievable, it -- it was -- it grew
 like mushrooms after the rain.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
66 
 
 
  
Q: And was this -- when Schacter came in Decem
ber and started those li
ttle choirs in the 
me n™s barrack, and then the wome n™ s barrack, 
was -- was that secret at that point, or 
that™s -- that was okay at th
at point?  Do you remember? 
  

A: Again, there were no Germans in the barrack
s, and the gendarmes were out at -- outside 
at the gate, and this was happening in 
the cellar after wor
k. I don™t think it was 
clandestine or illegal, it 
was just unofficial and -- 
  

Q: So that the permission that was gotten because Epstein said so mething to the Germans 
was to bring in the instruments? 
  

A: That was only after it was deci
ded that that™s a good idea, we
™ll take advantage of it, and 
we divide -- deci -- 
devise a program that will help them
 to project them to the world.  
  

Q: Right. 

  

A: But I don™t understand, they had occupied all 
of Europe, America wa
s across the Atlantic, 
why would they have to care to show a 
good report card with good behavior or good 
treatment of the Jews?  I -- 
that™s what I was thinking about, who -- for whom did they 
need this?  They were the ma sters of the world. 
  

Q: And all of this cultural 
activity, and intellectual activity
 started in 1942 as far as you 
r e me mb e r ?  
  

A: End of ™42. 
  
Q: End of ™42. 

  

A: End of ™42.  

  

Q: Now did you -- besides -- if -- if 
you were rehearsing as much as -- 
  

A: When you say that the -- that -- that [indeci
pherable] was happening before this okay by 
the Germans. That was still not secr et, but was not offi cial. 
  

Q: Right. And that was performe d publicly be
fore it was part of this other plan? 
  

A: That was performe d in that 
cellar, and then it was performe
d in that auditorium of that 
boy™s home that we circled there,
 next to the town™s square. 
  

Q: Right. Did you also go to performa nces of ot
her groups, as we ll as be
ing in rehearsals, or 
did you [indecipherable] too much?  
  

A: I -- I did, but not too many, because I was -- I 
-- I f -- I went to cabarets because that was 
really important to -- you know, when you 
are -- when you are under the -- somebody™s 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
67 
 
 
thumb, if you can play a trick on him, ma kes 
you happy. So be -- being part of this -- this 
verbal dart throwing gave you even more an
 uplift than -- than 
-- than the singing. 
  
Q: Mm-hm. Re ally?  Did yo
u -- did you go to lectures? 
  

A: No. 

  

Q: And did you go to chamber music, or 
the orchestra performa nces at all? 
  

A: Yeah. 

  

Q: Youdid? 

  

A: Yeah. 

  

Q: Do you remember anything about 
those performances?  What you -- 

  

A: No, I went most to piano 
recitals or sonatas. The -- 
  

Q: Theviolin? 

  

A: Pardon?  The vi
olin and piano. 
  

Q: Andpiano. 

  

A: And there -- there were [indecipherable] Ali
ce So mmer-Herz. She still live s, she is 85 -- 
95. 
  

Q: Really? 

  

A: L-Lives in London. And unfortunately lost a s
on who was a excellent ce
llist. I seen him. 
  

Q: And she was a violinist, or she was a pianist? 

  

A: Shepiano. 

  

Q: Pianist. 

  

A: That -- that was -- that wa
s also very uplifting. And I thi
nk by that time they must have, 
with these all instruments, have -- one or two additional pianos came in.  
  

Q: Mm-hm. This is going to be an odd ques
tion. Who tuned the pianos?  It™s one thing to 
tune a violin, you can tune it, 
but were the pianos tuned? 
  

A: Oh, there were tuner -- 

  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
68 
 
 
Q: There were tuners there? 
  

A: Yeah, the musicians themselves, Gideon Klein tuned our piano. 

  

Q: Uh-huh. So they sounded -- they 
sounded good?  These were good pianos? 
  

A: Yeah, there wasn™t -- not a -- a -- you know
, it™s terrible when you get old, don™t get old. 
What -- what happens to me  is I had a perf
ect comma nd of the English language without 
ever learning, just by heari
ng and reading. And suddenly in 
the mi ddle of the sentence, a 
word -- a simple, regular conversation word
 doesn™t come to mi nd. And it comes up in 
Czech and in German, t he only tw
o languages I learned formally.  
  

Q: [indecipherable] 

  

A: It™s a -- it™s embarrassing, you know? 

  

Q: At least it come s up in some  language. 

  

A: Yeah, but you can™t explain it in
 Czech to an American. So -- 

  

Q: We have to stop and change the tape. 

 

End of Tape #6

Tape #7 
  
Q: Edgar, when you were at rehearsals with -- 
with Schacter, did he rehearse the soloists 
separately, and then brought you 
together with the choir?  Do
 you have any recollection? 
  

A: Yeah, yeah, no. When -- when the choir was 
little progressed, then he tried the total 
ensemble, yeah. 
  

Q: So you would rehearse separately from the soloists? 

  

A: Yeah. 

  

Q: Did he -- 

  

A: They didn™t need as much rehearsing becau
se they were professionals, they have sung 
these operas several time s in thei r life. 
  

Q: So you guys in the choir needed more rehearsal? 

  

A: Yeah,yeah. 

  

Q: But you weren™t singing as much as the -- n-
not in these operas. In the Requiem you s a ng 
more, as a choir than you did th
e operas. Am I correct, or not? 
  

A: Wherever the part of the -- 

  
Q: Chorus. 
  

A: -- choir come s up, we were singing. 

  

Q: Right. 

  

A: Yeah. 

  

Q: Did he ever kick anyone out
 because they were terribl e?  
Not because they were looking 
sideways -- 
  

A: Terrible at singing? 

  

Q: Yeah. 

  

A: First of all he wouldn™t have -- if he ha
d recognized it in the 
beginning, he would not 
have accepted person. And which a -- which was 
cruel, because everyone deserved a little 
uplift. But he let people be in during the reh
earsals, and then for the performa nce he said, 
ﬁYou better go in the 
audience and watch.ﬂ 
  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
70 
 
 
Q: Really? 
  

A: Yeah. That -- that™s -- that
™s as much as he did, but -- 

  

Q: Did people get angry at that? 

  

A: I™m sure they did -- 

  

Q: I bet they did -- 

  

A: I™m sure, yeah -- 

  

Q: -- they got angry, yeah. But you -- 
you stayed for the performa nces? 
  

A: Yeah. 

  

Q: Did you have to get dressed in a particular way? 

  

A: No. 

  

Q: You just came  in whene  -- the wa -- any way you were. 

  

A: Then for the performa nc es, you put on your 
best, and that was the best of the 110 pounds 
you had brought in. 
  

Q: And you kept the 110 pounds of clothi
ng, they weren™t take
n away from you? 
  

A: No, it wasn™t 110 pounds of clothing, there was food -- 

  

Q: Uh-huh,right. 

  

A: -- and there was beddi
ng, and there was -- 
  

Q: Isee. 

  

A: -- other things, shaving, and 
it -- whatever I brought, I -- I 
had with me , whatever wasn™t 
worn out, so I still had with me . 
  

Q: I just realized some thing. So 
you could bring in shaving cream -- 
  

A: Yeah. 

  

Q: -- you could bring in soap, which -- 

  

A: But what did you do when it ran out?  Yeah. 

  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
71 
 
 
Q: -- but at some  point it ra
n out, yeah, what happened? 
  
A: So you were shaving just -- soap -- some how 
we had soap, I don™t -- I think there was a 
issue, or issuing of soap. As I to
ld you, I don™t reme mber many details. 
  

Q: Mm.  

  

A: So you f -- you use regular soap just so the ra
zor slides better, and 
I was shaving at that 
time with a straight razor. I didn™t have a 
-- there were -- there were these Gillette double 

bladed razors, but I reme mber I wa
s shaving with a 
straight razor. 
  

Q: Andtoothpaste? 

  

A: Pardon? 

  

Q: Toothpaste? 

  

A: Toothpastewasn™timportant
, a toothbrush was important. 
  

Q: Did you brush your teeth every day? 

  

A: Yes. 

  

Q: Yeah? 

  

A: Was kissing, so I had to. 
  
Q: And how did you keep clean with cold 
water? Did you wash with cold wa ter? 
  

A: It was disa greeable. 

  

Q: It was di -- 

  

A: No, I -- I wash -- 

  

Q: And -- and you -- and you washed your clothes, or was there laundry? 

  

A: There was a military laundry, and my moth
er, I mentioned, came three weeks after me, 
and first -- her first job was 
in a cleaning detail with buckets, and brushes and they we re 
cleaning rooms in the children™s home, and in the offices, and I don™t know where -- 

where else , where cleaning was necessary, a
nd where the regular 
inhabitants did not 
clean. So -- and then she was in the laundry de
tail that was outside of town, that was on 
the way to the small fortress, was a military laundry fr om -- used by the military before. 

And once a month you could put all your dirty st
uff in a bag, ma rked, and give to them, 
and you got it two, three days back. 
  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478

Q: Really? 
  

A: Yeah. And again I had an advantage my st
uff could be washed more often, because my 
mother took the bag, and I believe she -- 
  

Q: They actually have hot water there? 

  

A: I tell you exactly, I have no idea. I™m sure
 they did because there was central steam 
comi ng fr om somewhere. I™m sure they did, a m
ilitar --  today they wash in cold water so 
the stuff doesn™t shrink or bleed, but at that
 time , things were washed in hot water. 
  

Q: Now, it sounds odd to have thousands and thous
ands of people giving th
eir clothes in this 
ghetto, to a central laun
dry. Doesn™t it seem -- 
  

A: Everyone had it in a bag, and it wasn™t take
n out of the bag, it was washed in the bag. 
  

Q: In the bag? 

  

A: In the bag. 

  

Q: And you got it back wet? When you got it 
back -- do you have any idea how the people 
dried their clothes? 
  

A: You better ask my wife, 
I don™t remember. I never -- 
  

Q: You never hung anything. 
  
A: I never had to hang that. 

  

Q: Huh. 

  

A: I don™t know, actually my st
uff my mother brought, and I 
don™t know whether she hung it 
some where, or whether she -- she was a very fussy lady. At home  I reme mber when I 

went for vacation to her siblings, they were 
-- one day they we re s-soaking, the next day 
they were boiling the stuff, the third day 
they were washing. And then it was washed, 
they took it down to the beach -- 
to the river, spread it out on
 the lawn and let it bleach in 
the sun. And when it was dry they ma de it wet again so it can bl each some  more. And -- 
  

Q: Lot of work. 

  

A: Lot of work. And when she came to vis
it and our kids in the white socks ran around 
without shoes, the bottom, the sole was gra
y, even comi ng out from the washer. She said, 
ﬁYou see?  These machines are no good, you have to wash by hand.ﬂ So she took the 

socks and started to wash them in soap. They 
didn™t come  out totally white, but she said, 
ﬁYou see?  This is how it™s supposed to
 look.ﬂ What an old fashioned girl. 
  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478

Q: Let™s talk about your -- 
  

A: We should talk about my mother, 
she™s more interesting than I am. 
  

Q: Yes, yes, no. I -- no, I want to talk about your
 mother, and they we™
ll get back to the -- 
the -- the music. Your parents come  a few w
eeks after you come , right, three weeks, am I 
right? 
  

A: Three weeks. And I was standing on the ma in st
reet with a -- right in
 front of the church 
when she walked by and she looked at me  
like said, did you see wh
at you get us into?  
You know, I read it on her looks. 
  

Q: And she thought that yo
u had brought her there? 
  

A: No, but -- 

  

Q: It was -- but because they 
were keeping families together? 
  

A: They mi ght have -- no, because if I wouldn™t 
ha ve volunteered, they mi ght have still been 
there, at home. 
  

Q: Uh-huh. And you too. 

  

A: Ye -- yeah. She didn™t say, but
 I could read it on the looks. 
  

Q: And where did they live when they first came? 
  
A: Mother went to Dresner, a
nd Father went to the Hannover. 

  

Q: Uh-huh. 

  

A: It was already opened at that time. 

  

Q: Right. And your father is about how
 old at this point, in his 60™s? 

  

A: He was 64 when he went in. 

  

Q: Wow. 

  

A: 60 -- 60 -- yeah, 64 and a half, 64. 

  

Q: And your mother is 18 years younger. 
Do they both get work right away? 

  

A: He got a job, I don™t know how he discharged 
it, peeling potatoes. It 
was a sitting job, and 
these potatoes were stolen from the pigs, b
ecause  half of them were rotten. They had not 
only to peel them, they had to cut away 
all the rotten part. But if you were hungry you 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
74 
 
 
could eat the [indecipherable] and you had so
me  -- filled your stomach. So it was a good 
job for -- for some  of the people. I don™t know
 how he got it, I had no influence in that. 
But he -- he wasn™t very happy with the whol
e situation. He -- he sat at home , when he 
retired from working, and after the wa r, until he 
went to bed, he sat at home  in the living 
room, with reading, with a 
tie, jacket and shoes on. He
 would not ma ke hims elf 
comfortable. He always had to be presen
tabl e. So for him this life was -- was -- 
  
Q: Wasreallyawful. 

  

A: -- was very tough. And Mother, again, did the 
best under the circumstances, and as I said, 
she even once was jailed, and -- by the German
s, because the woman from the upper bed 
had some thing she shouldn™t have had, or some  c ontraband under the bed, and Mother 

was on the lowest bed, so she was suspect
ed of -- of is -- that being hers. 
  

Q: Okay, we have -- I™m sorr
y, I have to interrupt you. 
  

A: That™s a shor t one. 

  

Q: Sorry for the interruption. Y-You were talk
ing about your mo ther being arrested because 
the -- her bunkmate, the th
ird tier, had contraband? 
  

A: Had some  contraband underneath, and it wasthought that it™s hers
, because it was under 
her bed. So she spent three days in the 
vault area of that 
commander of SS -- 
Kommandat ur, how do you say that in English? 
  

Q: Commandant? 
  
A: Commandant™s office, whatever. 

  

Q: Okay. 

  

A: And-- 

  

Q: And was this Sydell™s office?  Wa s 
he still there or is this later? 
  

A: I don™t remember whether -- 

  

Q: You don™t know. 

  

A: -- that  was on Sydell, or later. 

  

Q: Okay. 

  

A: But she -- she came out of it, she was 
unshaken that anything could happen to her 
because God is always with her. She -- 
  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
75 
 
 
Q: She wasn™t -- 
  

A: She wasn™t shaken -- 

  

Q: --hurt? 

  

A: -- she knew it™s going to come  out 
well, and it did three days later. 
  

Q: Were you worried? 

  

A: Yeah, sure. Father was -- he was fall
ing apart. And -- because th -- you never knew 
what™s ge -- you had no impact, a
nd -- on -- on anything like that. 
  

Q: Now, s -- he was living at the opposite e
nd of Terezín from where your mother was? 
  

A: Mother went to visit him, he -- 

  

Q: She could visit -- she could go? 

  

A: Yeah, oh yeah. 

  

Q: Yes. And so when she didn™t come , he 
knew that some thing had happened. Wa s he 
informed in some way that 
she was arrested, do you know? 
  

A: I think through me, we tried to fi rst not tell him, and then we said it, and we said it™s 
nothing, it™s going to come  out well. Actua
lly we were lying, because we didn™t know. 
But -- and then in the 
end proved that we were -- we were right. 
  

Q: Now were you bringing extra food to your mo
ther and your father? And was this ma inly 
in the evening, when they were together?  Or don™t y -- 
  

A: You ma de me  think. Most of the time, b
ecause -- yeah, the Hannover, yes, but I also 
occasionally went to Mother separa
te and Father separate, but -- 
  

Q: Mm-hm. Now, is there a time when they 
end up living together?  No, they never live 
together?  
  

A: In Terezín, [indecipherable] no. 

  

Q: In Terezín, that™s what I mean. They don™t.
 And consequently the 
three of you are never 
living together, so that
 you are all separate. 
  

A: Correct. 

  

Q: Do you see them very oft e n?  Almost daily? 

  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
76 
 
 
A: Yeah, yeah, I -- I was -- afte
r all the kitchens were running, 
I could dedicate myself to -- 
as I say, to some  of it™s me nu 
making, and -- and -- but I did not 
have to stay in a kitchen, 
spend a shift, or so -- 
  
Q: I see. So where did you eat ma in
ly?  Where did you take your meals? 
  

A: Where I was at the mo ment. 

  

Q: Where you -- so, would you wait in line? 

  

A: No, no.  

  

Q: And where would you go -- the 
-- where people would go -- 
  

A: In-- 

  

Q: Just in the kitchen? 

  

A: In the kitchen, yeah. 

  

Q: So essentially you could eat whenever 
you wanted, as long as food was available? 
  

A: Yeah, sure. Told you that my aunt was right. 

  

Q: Yeah. No, no, for -- for sure she was right
. And were your parent
s -- especially your 
father, at some  point found it 
advantageous that you had gone fi
rst?  They -- did he realize 
the implication?  
  

A: After the war, I found a poem where she writes 
about it, that they thank for their life to 
me . Which I don™t [indecipherable] I know they™re 
thankful, grateful for their life, for my 
decision. They never me ntioned it, and never 
came  up and I never asked. But I found it in 
one of the birthday poems. 
  

Q: And that you found after the war? 

  

A: Yeah. 

  

Q: So you -- but you were very devoted to them? 
  
A: Yeah, in spite of the hittings.  

  

Q: Right. But they stopped hitt
ing at a certai
n point, yes? 
  

A: Yeah, when I got bigger than them. 

  

Q: Did they? Were they shor t people, or they tall people? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
77 
 
 
  
A: No, Father was tall. 
All his brothers were ta
ll, and his sisters, too. 
  

Q: Yeah. 

  

A: Mother were shorter. Two sisters were little
 taller, but the rest of the family was me dium 
s -- 
  

Q: Did they have a sense of humor?  

  

A: I don™t think so. 

  

Q: You don™t think so. 

  

A: At least not in my presence. Not in my presence. 

  

Q: When -- when you -- I™m going to come  to the Verdi Requiem in a mi nute, but when you 
think about -- if you close your eyes and 
think about walking ar
ound Terezín, and think 
about what people were looking 
like, and smelling like and what the sounds were like -- 
was it hurt --  
  

A: I don™t think they were smelling bad. People -- 

  

Q: You don™t think so? 

  

A: -- tried -- those who were able to mo
ve around, took care of their personal hygiene, 
including, or in spite of the cold water. 
  

Q: And did people look depressed? 

  

A: They -- I don™t know whether it was de
pressed. I don™t know whether -- I™m not a 
psychologist, to be able to reco -- but they 
-- they did not look happy 
like as if they were 
at home, but it -- they -- the feeling must ha
ve been ther e, that they™re better off than 
those who are deported so me where, because th
ey were 60 kilome ters from Prague. The 
ma jority was -- were Czech speaking people. If
 they go to the east to Poland, they™ll be 
among Polish people. They don™t know how they 
will be received, how they will be, how 
their life will be with them, where they 
are the domi nant part of the population. And 

that™s what the Germans Jews compl a ined about, that the Czechs, because they were first 

there, had the -- the privileged st atus, as privileged as it can be in a camp. But they -- they 

had the connection -- 
  

Q: Was that an accurate -- 

  

A: -- yeah, su -- yeah. 

  

Q: It was an accurate portrayal? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
78 
 
 
  
A: Yeah. 

  

Q: Do you have any idea how ma ny people understo
od that if they could be protected, they 
would not be put in the transport?
 You felt protected, insofar as -- 
  

A: Yeah. 

  

Q: -- one -- one could be -- 

  

A: In spite I haven™t been at the end. 

  

Q: Right. 

  

A: Yeah. 

  

Q: So were there -- 

  

A: You know, people tried, with connections --
 if you knew someone in that office, if you 
knew some one very well, you could go there an
d say, do something with that card. So 

they do something, but another family has to go.  
  

Q: Right. 

  

A: So then you would feel -- should feel 
bad, although they ma y be going in the next 
transport, but at that time you did some thing 
that -- it wasn™t right. When I speak in 
schools, I had a sixth grader ask me , ﬁDo you f
eel guilty that you survived? ﬂ  And that™s a 
heavy question for a sixth grader. And I didn™t.
 I don™t feel guilty, because I would fe -- I 
-- I fe -- I would feel guilty if I would have caused some body else to die, but I don™t feel 

guilty that I survived, I only feel sad for 
those who didn™t. And this -- that -- you get 
some  of these tough questions from those kids. 
  

Q: Did you ever feel -- forget guilty, because clearly you didn™t do some thing against 
anybody, right?  But there is a kind of -- I don™
t know whether I want to call it moral 
compromi se  one makes. You can™t be morally pur
e in a situation like that. So the fact that 
you™re protected always means th
at some one else is unprotected. 
  

A: Yeah. The self preservation -- 

  

Q: The self preservation, yeah -- 

  

A: No, no, the -- the act, or 
the thought of self preser -- 
  

Q: Isstrong. 

  

A: -- preservation, ma kes you partial to yourse
lf without regard about some body else.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
79 
 
 
  
Q: And that you understood, for a long time. 

  

A: Yeah. 

  

Q: Let™s talk about the Requiem.  

  

A: No, that come s a fterwards. First we have to
 talk about the inspecti
on of the international 
Red Cross. And the Germans just decided 
what they will do, and who will be there, 
report card writer. We found out it™s the in
ternational Red Cross, everybody was happy. 
Now, the international Re d Cross, they will 
force them to ma ke it real, a proper, a good 
and beneficial stay here. Give all of us to have a beneficial stay. So it was designated 

which way they will led -- be led, on that -- th
at was the main street  between the square 
and the -- and the church. The barracks a
nd tents, where the war industrial production 
was taking pl ace was all taken down. The girls fr
om the agriculture planted lawn and -- 
and flower beds on that square. And the houses on
 that street all got 
a face lift, a -- a new 
coat of paint. And stores were opened, 
money was printed. Have you seen the money?  
You must have.  
  

Q: [inaudible]. 

  

A: Terezín money in all denomi nations, and it 
looks like money of any 
other country, except 
for George Washington, there was Moses with
 the two tablets on it. And there was not 
much to do with it, becau -- 
so they opened the bank, and you could ma ke a -- a savings 
account, but there was no interest on your money, just to deposit it. 
  
Q: So when did all of that start?  The pre 
-- the -- the preparation 
for the ™44 -- do you know? 
  
A: End of ™42, beginning of ™43. 

  

Q: So it™s a long period of time ?  

  

A: Yeah,yeah. 

  

Q: Okay. 

  

A: And there was a shoe store and the clothes st
ore, and I think I told you about it. They put 
the -- the clothing that wa s in 
that warehouse was suddenly put 
out, put on coat -- a co -- 
coat hangars, and exposed and exhibited in th
at store, and the shoes, too. And that was 
that -- the only benefit of that money. Y
ou could buy for the -- get the mo ney, because 
after three years, your 
shoes wear, and your clothes wear, you have not much to change. 
So that was a benefit. There was a grocery st
or e, and they were se
lling there mustard and 
relish. I don™t know, the Germans must have 
had a -- a surplus of those two items. But it 
was a good -- good to -- to vary a taste of your slice of bread that you got. 
  

Q: And who got the -- everybody get the m
oney, or only a certain portion of you? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
80 
 
 
  
A: Those who worked. 

  

Q: Those who worked. 

  

A: Those who worked. And you [indecipherabl
e] enough you could take a friend. You paid 
for tickets for the -- for those performa n
ces. And I don™t know what else you could use 
your money for, the stores, the 
bank, the -- the [indecipherable] 
  

Q: Right. 

  

A: And you could buy a stamp, that you could 
send some body i n Prague, which they woos -- 
would use the stamp to send you a food package. 
  

Q: So you could receive food packages? 

  

A: You could get a food package. There™s no gua
rantee th -- that you get 
everything that™s in 
the package.  
  

Q: Mm-h m.  

  

A: Some the Germans would steal, and some
 th -- take out, consider contraband. And you 
know, if they send a loaf of bread it was cu
t open to see where there™s anything inside 
that shouldn™t be there. Like in prisons. A
nd so -- and some  was stolen by the people who 
worked in that Terezín Post Office, other Jews
. That™s the dark side of the prisoners. And 
so these were the few things I can reme mber the money was good for. 
  

Q: So if this starts in ™43, al
l the preparations, is that when 
Schacter come s up with the idea 
of the Verdi Requiem?  
  

A: For some  reason, in January ™43, the last tr
ansport was sent away, and here we are in 
July, and no transports since January. 
I have no idea why. Everybody was up and happy, 
that this is the end of deportations. So he al
so had got the courage to start to impleme nt 
what he was thinking the Requiem
, knowing, or at least anticip
ating that this choir will 
stay together. There was a huge uproar when he
 came  up with that idea. All the scholars 
and professors, and the -- and 
the bor -- the borders -- the --the elder -- the -- the Council 
of Elders, they all protested for different 
reasons. The -- the scholars and the rabbis, why 
would you as Jews in a Jewish ghetto perfor
m a Catholic ma ss for the dead, when there 
are comparable works on Jewish themes?  [indecipherable] and so, which cannot be 

performe d in -- anywhere in occupied Europe
, and this is the only place you could. He 
did not give in to this. He  didn™t say it ope
nly because it was dangerous to say, but I 
know that he -- his mi nd was on being -- wanting to be able to sing to the Germans in 

Latin what he couldn™t tell them in German to
 their face. Like the 
-- the [indecipherable] 
the day of wrath, the [indecipherable] that it 
-- i-in this book, the names of all the sinners 
are insc ribed, and none will escape the punishme nt
. So this -- there were about three or 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
81 
 
 
four such occasions. And this is what drove hi
m to get it out of hi m, and be able, even for 
distance, in the absentia, to tell the Germans. 
  
Q: You mean whether the Germans were there or  not? 

  

A: Pardon? 

  

Q: Wh -- you™re saying whether the Germ
ans were there or not to hear it. 
  

A: No, yeah, they were not there. 

  

Q: Right. 

  

A: And the Council of Elders thought, if the 
Germans find out the intentions behind this 
performa nce, that will really be dangerous 
for the singers and for him, and ma ybe even 
implications for the rest of the population. And -- 
  

Q: I ne -- I need to interrupt you, I™m sorry -- 

  

A: Yeah. 

  

Q: -- I™m going to stop th
e tape [indecipherable] 
  

A: Is another oil truck comi ng in? 

  

Q: No. 
 
End of Tape #7

Tape #8 
  
Q: Edgar, you were talking about the council bein
g possibly upset if the German -- I me an -- 
  

A: Reallyupset. 

  

Q: -- upset if the Germans would find out. 
Now, let me  ask you some thing. You said you 
know from Schacter what -- wh
at he was really feeling. 
  

A: That was the driv
ing thought behind -- 
  

Q: Yes. Yeah, is -- is that because you were 
rooming with him at this time, and you talked 
with him?  
  

A: Yeah. This friend of mi ne, the lawyer, meanwhile was deported, and we found in a attic 
of a house in the a backyard of one of t
hose private houses, that must have been a 
mother-in-law arrangeme nt, and the stairs up to
 the attic, and with a carpenter connection 
again, we got a -- a little sepa
ration, and we had a room with
 privacy for the two of us. 
And so I was pretty muc h informed a bout
 him, his lifestyle, his thoughts, and his 
determination. And -- 
  

Q: But let me  ask you -- I -- I just want
 to know -- understand some thing. You -- did you 
meet hi m separately from joining the choi
r, or only when you joined the choir? 
  

A: Through the choir -- 

  
Q: Through[indecipherable] 
  

A: -- we met, and for -- for some reasons, incl
uding that I provided some  mo re food for him, 
we ca -- we came close. 
  

Q: You got together, I see. 

  

A: I still me ntion, I don™t have any comp lexes 
that he would have f
ound in me a -- a level 
companion, cause I was a young guy, and his circle
 were the musi -- social circle were 
the musicians, the composers, and he had othe
r interests. But we were very close, and 
very good, and -- 
  

Q: And what was the difference in ag
e between the two of you, do you think? 
  

A: He was born 1905, so it was about 19 years. 

  

Q: That™s a big difference, yes. But you --
 you spent a lot of time together, I gather? 
  

A: Yeah. Not a -- not a lot. We were both -- 

  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
83 
 
 
Q: Busy. 
  

A: -- during the day we were both working, and then -- he then became part of that free time 
departme nt. And I think his assignment, his job 
was working within this departme nt so he 
didn™t have to go some where to a -- I don™t know 
stone quarry, or whatever he worked in 
in that. So that was his day job. And then 
in the evening, after everybody finished, they 
came for rehearsal.  
  

Q: So did he tell you ver -- talk to 
you about wanting to do the Verdi Requiem?  
  

A: Yeah. 

  

Q: And he told you what -- 

  

A: And he said why, that we can™t tell them in 
Ger man, and I -- it™s -- it™s -- it has to come  
out, and this is one way I can get it out. And 
when he was told about all the dangers, he 
told everyone in the choir, ﬁIt 
is assume d to be dangerous to you, to us, to the rest of the 
inma tes here. So if you don™t want to be part
 of it, I don™t feel bad if you leave.ﬂ Nobody 
left.  
  

Q: And what did the council th-think about the 
danger, that -- that some how the Nazis would 
discover hi s intention? 
  

A: That if they find out that 
he -- that the purpose of this wa
s to tell them, you bastards, you 
going to get it at  one point, that
 they will not appreciat e it. 
  
Q: But let me  ask you some thing, when you read the words of the Verdi Requiem, it™s als -- 
there™s also words of for give these peopl
e, whoever they are,
 who -- who, and the 
Requiem is speaking about both the wrath of
 God and begging for forgiveness, so -- 
  
A: Yes, so this -- th
is part we ignored.  
  

Q: But you sang it. 

  

A: And -- yeah, ignored as
 a -- as a thought -- 
  

Q: Isee. 

  

A: -- that propelle
d us to do it. 
  

Q: Isee. 

  

A: And in saying the -- the Libera me , wa
s interpreted as set me fr ee fr om here. 

  

Q: So some  of i t  was said for the Jews, and so
me of it was said against the --  the Nazis, as 
the interpretation, yes? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
84 
 
 
  
A: Yeah,yeah,yeah. 

  

Q: When -- when you were rehearsing, did you 
feel this kind of emotion, that you -- wh-
when -- just when you™re rehearsing yourself -- 
  

A: No, I just felt I™m part of a group that despis
es the Germans and the N
azis, and that this is 
the best we can do to get even w
ith them within our capabilities. 
  

Q: What was the -- were the 
rehearsals more intense than
 when you did ﬁThe Bartered 
Bride,ﬂ and ﬁThe Magic Flute,ﬂ 
and ﬁThe Marriage of Figaroﬂ? 
  

A: It was, because it was a different langua
ge, and it was much more difficult music. 
  

Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh, right. 

  

A: And much more concentra
tion was required. And some  people who didn™t work in the 
kitchen, were not so well-fed to really dedicate
 themselves to such a -- that was a hard -- 
  

Q: Yes. 

  

A: -- work on a half empty stomach. 

  

Q: Yes, it™s di fficult singing. 

  

A: Yeah. So with the fact that there were no tr
ansports, he was encouraged that he™ll have an 
easy job, as easy as this can be. Th -- I am 
sure Toscanini would have never undertaken it 
with -- with well-fed people, to teach them 
without a score. So it took six weeks -- we 

were six weeks into the rehearsal when the 
rumors sprung up the transports will resume. 

So every time a transport is put together, 
people from different sectors are involved. And 
so the choi r me mbers anticipated that  some 
of them will definitely be incl uded in the 

transport. So they pushed him to ma ke one pe
rforma nce for them, for their hard work, so 

they can enjoy performi ng it. And he would not
, because it wasn™t up to his standards yet. 
But then it became known that by September six, 5,000 people will be deported. He 

couldn™t resist, because  he  knew a lot of them
 will be in it, and he made a performance 
for them and their families and fr iends, not the o -- open, public sh -- performance. 
  

Q: So this is September ™43? 

  

A: Yeah. 

  

Q: Yeah. 

  

A: And the irony with this, the sad irony, th
at these 5,000 people -- a
bout -- he lost about 
half the choir, and these people went to Ausc
hwitz and they came  there, and they were 
treated differently than anybody else who ca me
 before them and after them. They could 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
85 
 
 
retain their clothes, they could retain thei
r luggage, and they went into a camp which was 
fr om then on called the fa mily camp. They 
lived together , not in privacy, but families 
were together. And they were there for six 
months, and they were not working, they did 
not -- and this Freddie Hirsch, he took care of
 the kids, entertained them a nd taught them. 
Als -- also ma de sport with them, and art, a
nd he really took care 
of the kids. And this 
group was held there while the Germans were 
negotiating with the al
lies in exchange of 
the German prisoners of war for these Jews, 
and also some war material. They wanted 
some  trucks, and -- and of course the alli
es wouldn™t give the Germans another few 
thousand soldiers that will then 
turn against them, and trucks th
at they will use in the war 
against them. So when the negotiations fell th
rough, in one night, all of those who were 
still alive from the 5,000 went in
to the gas. Wa s exactly three 
months -- six months later, 
on March eight. And this is also -- on Marc
h seventh is the -- was Masaryks™ birthday, 
President Masaryk, the first -- 
the creator of Czechoslovakia. So could be that had 
some thing to do with it, because they were
 -- they were planning the -- timing some  
things to coincide with some  -- some thing th
at gives you a bigger -- a ce -- bor -- bigger 
pain. 
  

Q: Was Schacter worried that he was 
going to be deported at that point? 
  

A: No, hadn™t -- 

  

Q: No, because -- 

  

A: No. 

  

Q: Was he protected in some way, do you think? 
  
A: Not that I knew, but those 
people who put together the tran
sport list had some  kind of 
directives whom to leave out, 
as long as it was possible. 
  

Q: And as far as you know, who was it who 
put together these transport lists? 
  

A: There was a departme nt, it was called evid
ence. Evidence is wher
e all the files about 
every single one who came into Terezín was ke
pt. A card with a name , wi th a transport, 
date of birth, a transport when they came  
in, and -- and also the transporting date when 
they left Terezín. I di d after the war sear
ch, y -- my parents survived, in spite of 
Schliesser being sent to Ausc
hwitz, and myself, my parents 
survived. I thought the easiest 
thing would have been if he had written on t
op of the card -- of th
eir card, do not deport 
it, initial it, that would have been the easiest
. I got copies of thos
e cards, there™s nothing 
there, and I was researching how he did it, 
because he must have done it, because it™s 
inconceivable that two, old, useless people woul
d stay there, especially before the Red 

Cross came, they deported a lot of old people,
 they wanted only -- they wanted the Red 
Cross only to see young, good looking people. 
  

Q: Maybe there was a special sec
tion for cards, a different place. 
  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
86 
 
 
A: So the -- the staff in that offi ce -- 
  

Q: Would do it. 

  

A: -- did it.  

  

Q: And was that then approved by the council, or did they just do it themselves? 

  

A: The head of the Council of Elde
rs had to sign the transport list. 
  

Q: List. 

  

A: And then later we get to why he was -- a
nd the whole Council of Elders was sent away. 
He must have found out where they go, and wh
at™s happening, and their destination, and 

he refused to sign it. He told the camp commander, you sign it. So he, the camp 

commander, must have guessed that he know
s what™s happening, and didn™t want the 
word to be spread among the inma tes because
 a panic would be cr
eated. So the whole 
council left. But even though in September si
x, and the -- half the choir left, and they 
have -- they have -- he has recruited new 
people and started the whole thing from the 
beginning with them. And he lost one more
 time, less people, and recruited new and 
started a third time with new pe
ople. And then in January ™
44 was the first performa nc e. 
  

Q: With the new -- with the new group. Di
d any of the soloists get deported -- 
  

A: No. 

  
Q: -- or was it only among the choir? 
  

A: Maybe some. I didn™t know all of them --  

  

Q: [indecipherable]yeah. 

  

A: -- but those [indeciphera
ble] Schacter did not.  

  

Q: Uh-huh, in -- in the Requiem group -- 

  

A: Yeah,no. 

  

Q: -- the soloists did not get deported. 

  

A: No. 

  

Q: Isee. 

  

A: And he had two for each part, should some thing happen to one, he has a replacement.  

  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
87 
 
 
Q: Anotherperson. 
  

A: [indecipherable] good organi -- 

  

Q: And when you did the Se ptember perfor
ma nce, September ™43, before that first 
deportation, was that with a piano accompani me nt?   
  

A: Everything was only piano -- 

  

Q: Onlypiano. 

  

A: All the time, only piano. 

  

Q: And did he -- 

  

A: And when I listen now to a Requiem with a 
concert, and a -- the -- 
the trumpets and the 
drums, I said how -- it seemed to us like -- li
ke absolutely perfect performa nce, just the 

piano.  
  

Q: Right. 

  

A: And a crappy piano on top of it. How did 
they bring out all these -- these impressions, 
these results [indecipherable] of -- 
that the orchestra can provide.  
  

Q: And did he play the piano, or did he 
do the conducting and some one else played? 
  
A: No, bu -- there -- during the re
hearsal he played the piano, 
and do -- and during -- in the 
performa nce, Gideon Klein played. 
  
Q: Uh-huh. 

  

A: They were ve ry close toge ther.  

  

Q: And did Gideon kli -- Klein ev
er play at the rehearsals? 
  

A: No,no. 

  

Q: So it™s a -- it™s some what odd, however, to pl
ay only at a performa nce, and never at a 
rehearsal. 
  

A: Gideon Klein had other work to do -- 

  

Q: Yeah, well he™s -- 

  

A: -- he -- he wa s composing -- 

  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
88 
 
 
Q: Right. 
  

A: -- and he was playing per -- giving performa n
ces. Schacter, that™s why I said he didn™t 
tolerate any inattention, because everybody had to
 look at hi s eyes, and see when he gets 
the signal. 
  

Q: Do you remember anything ever going wrong in the concerts? 

  

A: Wr ong?  

  

Q: Yeah. 

  

A: In the conc ert? 

  

Q: Yeah. 

  

A: I™m sure it did, but everybody was so grateful 
for it that -- that eith
er they didn™t notice, 
didn™t want to notice, didn™t ma ke an impact 
on them, they we re happy to -- to be part of 
it whether active or  passive.  
  

Q: Now, once you started giving performa nces, 
or Schacter is conducting the performa nces 
of the Requiem, starting in January ™44 -- Janua
ry ™44, right? You give about 14 or 15 -- 
  

A: 15,yeah. 

  

Q: 15performa nces. 
  
A: And each time  with less singers. 

  

Q: So you ne -- he never restar
ts again, he just accommodates? 
  

A: Only three times. Only three times he star
ted to -- with new people. And then after the 
15
th
, he was left with 60 singers. 
  

Q: Out of 150. 

  

A: And not the same  a mount in each voice. 

  

Q: Uh-huh. 

  

A: So he didn™t want it. But then came the 
order from ca mp commander, that he wants a 
performa nce of the Requiem for high SS of
ficials who ca me  from Vienna and Prague, 
from Berlin, to shake the hands of the Re
d Cross people who were also invited -- no 

Jews. 
  

Q: This is -- this is Rahm, right? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
89 
 
 
  
A: Rahm, yeah. And you know they had to pa
y homage to the Red Cross [indecipherable] 
and so now, I didn™t know -- he didn
™t want to do it with the --
 with the regular choir, but 
it was an opportunity he was dreaming of. Not 
only can he sing it to them for distance, 

but he has them right in front of him, they 
are sitting there, and he
 can really tell them. 
And the paradox again is, that we all thought --
 we told him, and the Germans were the 
only ones who knew that we were actually
 singing our own Requiem. You know, they 
knew where we will end up. They didn™t think 
that there would be some  survivors. So 

that was a mutual gi ving it to each other. 
  

Q: And the Germans knew what was being sung, 
because they knew the Catholic liturgy. 
  

A: I think -- I™m sure, yeah. But I think th
ey -- they thought it™s
 a -- it™s a mu sical 
performa nce, and -- but they also underst
ood the meaning of i t , and what™s going to 
happen with us, that this is -- 
  

Q: Your own Requiem. 

  

A: Our own eulogy. The -- when this Red Crosscame , I couldn™t understand that they accept 
the German conditions that they will not in
terview people at random on the street, only 
special auditioned people that the Germans pr
epared to meet them. And they knew that 

they™re saying lies, but it was again agains
t the threat of the whole fa mily being 
endangered if they refuse. So they did it. Bu
t I don™t -- still don™
t understand, if you were 
psychologist, rather than philosophy doctor,
 I would ask you, how 
is it possible to 
audition, and indoctrinate little kids to the 
same performance? When they came to the 
playground, and there were some  kids who 
never been on a playground because they 
were not allowed at home to go, the little ones. When they came for the chocolate bar that 

was on the table in front of the playground, the only one uniform was Rahm, and they 

had to address him uncle, and they, ﬁUncle Rahm, again chocolate?ﬂ As if they were 

already fed up with chocolate, and there were
 some  kids who never knew what chocolate 
was because it wasn™t on thei
r ration tickets at home . This I don™t understand, how they 
got the kids to do that. Maybe they told them
 you™re going to play a theater or whatever. 
But this were tough for me  to understand. 
  

Q: Did you see that?  We re you there?  

  

A: No, not -- 

  

Q: No. 

  

A: -- not, I didn™t -- 

  

Q: Were you told that at the time? 

  

A: Yeah, yeah, by the -- the -- t
hose who were in charge of 
the kids. And the agriculture 
workers, and my wife a mong them, dressed in
 shorts, and nice blouse, ma rching by with 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
90 
 
 
the rake, or the -- the -- the spade over th
e shoulder, singing happy songs going to work. 
And the orchestra was playing in that pavili
on on the -- on the sta -- on the town square. 
It was a real happy town. This doesn™t belong 
to my li -- yeah, I hear
 the party. After the 
war, in -- in Newton was a Harvard philos
ophy psychology professor who researched to 
write a book about the Re d Cross, Internationa
l Re d Cross at that ti
me , what they should 
have done and didn™t do, and they shoul
dn™t have done and did do. And he was 
researching it, and I knew about it because I 
was translating his papers that he brought 
from Ger ma ny, from Austria, even the Frenc
h. And at one point he told me  he had an 
appointme nt with the then pres
ident of the Intern
ational Red Cross, Dr. Rossler. In his 
office, in his factory -- he had aluminum, 
a huge aluminum factory in Switzerland, and he 
came there, and the secretary sa ys, ﬁOh, Dr. 
Ros s ler called, he apologizes, he™ll be an 
hour, hour and a half late from another appoi
ntment. Make yourself comf ortable in the 
library.ﬂ Brought in cup of coffee, said [i
ndecipherable] whatever. And he perused -- and 
he found documents that he had branch fact
ories in Austria and in Germa ny where he 
used prisoners from conc entration camp. So 
how much was his enthusiasm to confront 
Germans, the Nazis?  Speaks for itself. So -- 
  

Q: Were you supposed to be interviewed by 
anybody during this time ?  Where -- where were 
you when they were visiting, did you see them? 
  

A: I -- I was just doing my work, I was not -- 

  

Q: Are you surprised that nobody said anything? 

  

A: No. 

  
Q: No. You think that fear was -- 
  

A: And I™m sor r y they didn™t, but some  si
ngle guy who didn™t have a family could have 
spilled the beans, but it woul
dn™t have helped, because this
 was called the International 
Red Cross, but the seven directors all were Swiss. 
  

Q: Uh-huh. 

  

A: There was no internationality in that. 

  

Q: Isee. 

  

A: And so it was very well done, 
like a real Potemkin village, 
that the German
s orchestrated. 
Before that cross -- Red Cross came I me
ntioned the old people
 -- a lot of old -- 
thousands of old people were deported, and 
after that, it must have been under the 

influence of the uprising in the Wa rsaw ghetto 
that the Germans did not wa nt it to happen 

in other ghettos as well, so all able bodied people who were not necessa ry for the war 

industry, and like agriculture fo
r where they produced for 
the Germans, and those who 
were necessa ry to ma intain the functioning of the town, of the ghetto as such, the 

physical functioning, were all deported, and 
Schliesser was gone, and I was among -- the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
91 
 
 
kitchens were running, so I was no l-longer ne
eded. So that was end of September ™44. I 
went and -- 
  
Q: Let me  -- let me  -- let me  hold it for one second. This performa nce for the Germans, was 
it Germans sitting in the fr ont row? 
  

A: Yeah. 

  

Q: And you can see them, and who -- do you see Eichma nn. Is he there? 

  

A: I didn™t know Eichma nn -- 

  

Q: Oh. 

  

A: -- I -- he -- he jus -- it is said that he wa
s there, but -- and it -- we often heard Eichma nn is 
in Terezín, transports will go. They knew that 
he was in charge of transports. But I never 
saw him face to face, so I wouldn™t ha ve
 recognized him among that gr oup.  
  

Q: Now, I know that you reported -- you 
reported in octo -- October one of 1944. 
  

A: October oneth, okay. 

  

Q: So then [indecipherable] what happens betw
een September -- the perfor -- the -- wait a 
second, June -- I™m sorry, June of ™44 and 
October?  Does Schacter keep you folks 

singing? There™s a few months there after -- af
ter the Red Cr oss visit, or is he deported? 
  
A: He was deported after me .  
  

Q: Afteryou. 

  

A: I didn™t know -- when I left -- 

  

Q: I see, he was still there -- 

  

A: -- he was st ill there, a
nd I didn™t know or think that 
he will be also deported. 
  

Q: I see. So does the choir -- does he
 keep working with people?  Do you -- 
  

A: We  -- we went -- after the Red Cross visit, 
we still di d --  we perfor -- we performed, and 
that was not much of a choi
r required, Pergolesi™s ﬁLa Se
rva Padroneﬂ, it was ma inly 
soloists and a small choir, but -- and we 
were doing ma inly get-togethers with anyone 
who wanted could come  and -- and listen.  
  

Q: So it became much more informal? 

  

A: Yeah,informal. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
92 
 
 
  
Q: Uh-huh. Did you end up learning mu sic?  
Could you read mus i c by this time?  
  

A: No, but Schacter taught me . He started to te
ach me  to play the piano, then I started to 
read music. And unfortunately, it didn™t 
go for very long, and after the war I had no 

chance to resume. I had to work to mainta
in my  parents and myself because we had 
nothing except what they had left fro
m the 110 pounds. I had nothing, comi ng from 
Auschwitz. So there was never an opport
unity for me  to break and study music. 
  

Q: Right. We  have to turn -- change the tape. 

 

End of Tape #8 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
93 
 
 
Tape #9 
  
Q: Edgar, prior to the -- the visit of the Re
d Cross, which was as far as I know, June 24
th
, 
1944, di -- th-the painter™s affair, they arrested 
the pain -- the artist was before that, am I 
correct? 
  

A: It was before that. 

  

Q: And so they were deported before the performa nce? 

  

A: Yeah. 

  

Q: Was that also surprising to you that that happened? 

  

A: We found out that -- why it happened, I don™
t know that -- how -- how it became known, 
but we found out in the -- on the street that 
the Ge rmans were [indecipherable] for this.  
  

Q: Right, for the sort
 of undercover -- 
  

A: Yeah. 

  

Q: Yeah. Now, you said that Schacter was 
a very sweet guy when he wasn™t being a 
conductor, but once he wa s going to be serious 
about his music, he was a tyrant. Wa s he 
also charisma tic? Wa s he  also a very compelli
ng person, or wa s he just very strict when 
he was doing his -- 
  
A: While we were working? 
  

Q: Yeah. 

  

A: I don™t know what do you mean by charisma tic. 

  

Q: Well, we -- 

  

A: He just was -- he dema nded full atten
tion, there was -- there 
was nothing else but 
rehearsing, and if you wanted to be with
 him, you had to pay full attention. 
  

Q: I think what I mean is, obviously
 people wanted to be with him. 
  

A: Yeah. 

  

Q: It wasn™t just the music, because you
 could have some body i n front of you who is 
conducting, who you didn™t want 
to be with, right?  I mean, the music alone wouldn™t 
necessarily be enough if some one wasn™t inte
resting, or taught you well. I mean, he had 
to have some thing. 
  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
94 
 
 
A: Yeah,yeah. 
  

Q: When he was teaching you piano, was he easier on you? 

  

A: Yeah. 

  

Q: Hewas? 

  

A: This wa -- yeah, well this was -- he was not aimi ng to ma ke me  aca m -- academy 
me mber, but he was starting to teach me  musi
c. Whether it was the relationship that he 
was easier, but he did not have a -- I don™t thi
nk he set a goal for hims elf where I should 
be at what time  --  
  

Q: Right. 

  

A: -- with my piano knowledge, but [indecipherable] 

  

Q: Now didn™t he also gi ve some  recitals, 
piano recitals, or  did he  accompany people? 

  

A: I think he  did accompany some . Not very of
ten, but I don™t think he gave recitals -- 
  

Q: Did he compose? 

  

A: -- because there were be tter pi anists than he was. 

  

Q: Uh-huh, than him, uh-huh. And was he a composer also? 
  
A: No,no. 

  

Q: So he was primarily a conductor, yes. Did he ever conduct some  of the work of the 
composers who were working in Terezín, Olan, or -- 
  

A: Very few of those works were presented to
 the public. They -- 
they played it, they 
performed it for the critique of the other musicians only. So those compositions were not 

heard in public in Terezín. 
  

Q: AlthoughﬁBrundibarﬂ
 was, wasn™t it? 
  

A: ﬁBrundibarﬂ is anothe r story. That was co
mposed in Prague, still, and when Krasa was 
deported to Terezín, he left th
e ma nuscript with the director
 of the orphanage, who was a 
musician hims elf. And unbeknownst to Krasa, 
this director, Freundenfeld was his name , 
studied with the kids ﬁBrundiba
r,ﬂ and performe d in Prague. 
  

Q: InPrague. 

  

A: And Krasa had no idea about it. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
95 
 
 
  
Q: Huh. 

  

A: So when we  came to Prague -- to -- to Te
rezín, he continued to work with ﬁBrundibarﬂ 
with an enlarged ensemble, it -- other kids, 
not just those from the orphanage. And he -- 

and Krasa was -- was very happy with it. He di
d not interfere or participate in anything 
else, or any of those performa nces. There 
was a time  when Sc hacter auditioned -- not 
auditioned, rehearsed with the kids, but he 
never conducted ﬁBrundiba
r.ﬂ It was always 
this Freundenfeld. 
  

Q: Huh. So ofte n the person who rehearsed the 
kids would not necessari
ly be the one that 
would -- 
  

A: No, it was not very often. This Freundenfe
ld, he was dedicated to that. There were 55 
performa nces of ﬁBrundibarﬂ. 
  

Q: Of bru -- yes. Did you see it? 

  

A: Yeah. 

  

Q: Did you like it? 

  

A: Yeah, it was a -- it was the same -- the same mot i ve as the Requiem, just a smaller 
framework that -- that was the -- especially 
with a [indecipherable] 
with the finale, where 
they sing we have overcome the oppressor, a
nd we  won, and victory is at hand. That was 
-- and the Germans didn™t know, because they we
re singing with -- in
 Czech. So that was 
a similar kind of a resistance, or at least 
a sole improveme nt and spiritual enlightenme nt 
as the -- 
  

Q: But what -- from what you explained, it™s 
clear that the Germans are oppressors, but it 
was not clear to you or your colleag
ues that they were murderers. 
  

A: No, that -- 

  

Q: So-- 

  

A: Now let me -- there was a -- one guy from Te
rezín went to Auschwitz, and one of the SS 
me n, a disgruntled SS man was a schoolma te 
in Sudeten. He brought in the SS unifor m 

and took him out on a motorcycle fr om Auschwitz. And he came to Prague -- to Te rezín, 

and he spoke with Edelstein, and told hi
m about what™s happening, and nobody would 
believe him.  This is impossible, it is -- it™s 
unthinkable. But then there were some  other -- 
for instance, those people who were helpi
ng load or unload the 
-- the dep-deportees 

noticed on the wagons that the -- always the same  ones wer e  comi ng back, you know, 

they are numbered, coded, numbered. And so 
one of them knew there is so mewhere a 
board loose behind the frame  of the -- of that
 little window that™s up there, the barred 
window. He  said, when you arrive, look where,
 and write it down, and put it in there,

under that trimmi ng. And it came back Auschw
itz but the person could not describe 
anything back -- because when you come  to Aus c hwitz, you don™t know what™s 
happening, you know -- know you™re getting a 
rougher treatme nt right away, but you 
have no idea. I know from
 my own experience. 
  

Q: How did you find out about this ma n who wa
s taken out of Auschwitz by the -- did you 
find it out when you were in Terezín or after? 
  

A: After. 

  

Q: After. 

  

A: After. 

  

Q: You think you would have believed him, 
if he ha d told you?  What do you think?   
  

A: If I had known hi m as some body who does 
not exaggerate, I -- I mi ght have -- 

  

Q: When you think about Edelstei
n just saying it can™t be, when
 he™s -- finally has before 
h i m,  s o me o n e  - -  
  

A: It™sodd. 

  

Q: -- do you think about what -- wh
at™s the ma tter [indecipherable] 
  

A: You could think he wants to ma ke hims elf 
interesting, or -- it™s 
-- it™s unthinkable to a 
norma l person. Not that I consider 
myself totally norma l, but -- 
  

Q: And do you think this is 
™43 or ™44?  Or earlier? 
  

A: Four ya -- ™44. 

  

Q: ™44. And are there no other rumors comi ng through?  Nothing? 

  

A: No,no. 

  

Q: Nothing is comi ng through to you because you™re so isolated. 

  

A: No. It was a -- one other person that es
caped from Auschwitz, a -- a Rudolph Vrba. I 
don™t know how he did it, I know that there we
re a group that dug a hol
e, and covered it 
up, and put on top some thing that 
repels the dogs, so they woul
dn™t give it away that they 
are in there. And they -- they
 escaped -- some  of them -- 
  

Q: There are four Jews at that time  -- 

  

A: No. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
97 
 
 
  
Q: And Vrba was with a ma n name d We tzler. 
The two of them escaped
 together. And then 
Mordowicz and Rosin escaped. And 
they told what was going on.  
  

A: Yeah. 

  

Q: And they went to Bratislava, so they were 
close. It ™s interesting. After Epstein is taken 
out -- you know, it™s interesting, 
he doesn™t believe this guy, 
but he doesn™t want to sign. 
  

A: Yeah, he -- 

  

Q: So what is he -- what -- 
what do you think he™s thinking? 
  

A: I don™t know, I think if it is 
really true, he doesn™t want to
 have the responsibility. He 
ma y have weighed -- like -- 
  

Q: And who come s a fter him?  

  

A: A Ger man, Dr. Epstein. And he was not
 a -- really a strong person to push for 
improve me nt, so -- so he did what he was to
ld, and then he was shot, and the new camp 
commander was an Austrian SS ma n, and he put in an Austrian ma n to be the head of the 

council, Murmelstein. He was not a very ni
ce person. He was very self-centered. And 
after the war he wound up in the Jewish ar
chives in the Vatican, in the library. 
  

Q: Really? 

  
A: Yeah. 
  

Q:  Wor k i ngt h er e? 

  

A: He was a rabbi, this Murmelstein. A
nd he lived his life 
out in the Vatican. 
  

Q: Interesting. Did -- did y
ou know Edelstein at all? 
  

A: Yeah, but not -- 

  

Q: Notwell? 

  

A: No, not -- 

  

Q: No. 

  

A: He was I -- you know, there was a guy experi
enced, traveling to Pa
lestine, and on -- on 
German insistence, and tra -- I was a nobody. 
  

Q: When Schlisser -- Schliesser was 
deported, he was deported before you. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
98 
 
 
  
A: Yeah. 

  

Q: Did you then think you were vulnerable to
 being deported if he was -- if he was 
deported? 
  

A: I didn™t think I was vulnerable,
 I thought my parents would be. 
  

Q: Uh-huh. You thought some thing else w
ould protect you because you were younger? 
  

A: No[indecipherable] 

  

Q: Orsome thing. 

  

A: Yeah, I was the big shot, so I didn™t -- wa
sn™t concerned about myself, I was concerned 
about my pa rents.  
  

Q: When -- when you think back now before your deportation, and 
you -- and I don™t know 
whether you thought about the three years that you were th
ere, and thought about what 
the council did or didn™t do, did you 
have respect for the council? 
  

A: Yeah. 

  

Q: Youdid. 

  

A: Definitely. They tried their 
best. Of course, as -- as -- as
 the carpenter stole a board, and 
the cook stole a -- a piece of bread or some thi
ng else, they also did favors for their family 
and ma ybe e ven close friends, that were at 
the -- at the cost of
 -- of other -- somebody 
else. I -- I don™t thi
nk that anybody under those circumstan
ces would stay totally clean. 
  

Q: Right. 

  

A: And the wife™s father did. I™m sorry, I have 
to apologize, he -- he 
was straight like an 
arrow. 
  

Q: Did you know hi m then? 

  

A: Yes. I didn™t know her, but I knew him. 

  

Q: [indecipherable] you knew hi m.  

  

A: He was the head of the police, the secret 
police that without uniform
 ma de inspections in 
kitchens and in storerooms  and warehouses. 
And his job and his de
dication and his whole 
thinking was if nothing will be st olen by 
individuals, everybody will have  more.  
  

Q: Uh-huh. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
99 
 
 
  
A: And that was his driving force. 

  

Q: And his name? 

  

A: OskarFuchs. 

  

Q: Oskar Fuchs. So he™s one of the rare people who stayed -- 

  

A: Absolutely. 

  

Q: -- completely straight. 

  

A: His wife had to deceive him when she -- 
when Hana brought home  some  toma toes from 
the field, she gave him half a toma to at lunc
h, and he said, ﬁWhere did this come  from? ﬂ  
She said ﬁOh, your daughter worked so we
ll, the supervisor gave her a toma to.ﬂ  
  

Q: So that was okay. When -- when -- did 
you receive a notificati
on that you would be 
deported, eventually did you -- 
  

A: Yeah, everybody did, you get the piece of paper,
 tomorrow, or after to
mor r ow at this and 
this time, report to the Hamburger -- 
  

Q: Do you remember that moment when you -- this is ma il, I guess. I me an, it seems so odd, 
but how -- was it handed to you? Is
 there a -- a pl ace where you -- 
  
A: It was brought to the place of your residence, wherever you lived. In barracks it was 
easier, a room, so they put through the five, si
x, seven from t his room, and then they gave 
it to the room Altesten, there were room s
upervisor, whatever she was called. Wa s called 
eldest , the eldest there, I mean that, even 
if they were not the oldest. And this was 
brought, I think just put in under the door
 where you lived, it was not even handed 
personally. 
  
Q: Did your heart sink when you saw this? 

  

A: No, I li -- I don™t think 
heart sank, I -- so I™m going, and I™m going to do some thing 
some where else. I don™t think -- 
  

Q: And did you go -- who were the first peopl
e you told?  Did you go to
 your parents right 
away? And -- 
  

A: Father was devastated, and Mother, she was 
such a believer in G
od, that nothing could 
shake her.  
  

Q: Really? 

  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
100 
 
 
A: She was the -- sure that I™m comi ng back. 
  

Q: Did that give you strength, her --
 her being so sure, in some  way? 
  

A: I didn™t think myself that 
-- that I would not come  back. 
  

Q: Youdidn™t. 

  

A: So you go some wheres -- 

  

Q: Right. 

  

A: -- do your work there, and then when the war ends -- 

  

Q: And the war -- 

  

A: -- you go home. 

  

Q: Right. And you were allowed how much?  We re
 you allowed to bring a bag of some thing? 
  

A: There were no -- no prescripti
ons for -- as to weight, but it
 was one duffel bag with the -- 
with the bedding, and -- and another l
uggage with some  clothing and shoes. 
  

Q: Now this was not a pass
enger train that you went on. 
  

A: No, that was not. 
  
Q: This is a cattle train. 

  

A: It was not any more. And there were a lot 
of people, about close to 70, and not everybody 
could sit at the same  time, you had to alternat
e. And if one of the older people fainted, or 
died, then they lied there, so it took up tw
o additional spaces for some one to sit down. 
And -- sorry -- we didn™t know how long we™re goi
ng to be on the trip -- on the train, but 

it took three full days and th
ere was no food, and no water in
 that enclosed truck -- 
wagon. There was one -- it was called comfort buc
ket in the corner, 
without any privacy, 
and [indecipherable] but you had to go, you hadto go. And with 70 people in three days, 

that bucket was full very quickly, and the same
 kind of -- of atmosphere there were not -- 
as with the old people when they went to 
the bathroom and c ouldn™t hold it, it was 
horrendous. 
  

Q: So this is the first time, for you, to be in th
is situation, that so de
teriorated, physically and 
-- 
  

A: Yeah. 

  

Q: -- otherwise, yes? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
101 
 
 
  
A: And while we were the -- very soon -- I 
don™t reme mber how soon after the door was 
locked and sealed, two boys from that home fo
r t he boys have attached themselves to me . 

I don™t know why, I wa sn™t a father figure, but
 I was a tall guy, and some how they felt 
confident. And we stayed together the -- th
e three days in the wagon. And when the door 
opened, there was -- wild guys came  in, in thos
e prison uniforms, and started to yell in 

German, out , out, out, hurry. I looked back, a
nd I could read backwards, from the back 

that sign, ﬁArbeit macht frei,ﬂ and Auschwitz. 
But it still didn™t mean anything to me , I 
[indecipherable] we coming to labor camp to do -- 
  

Q: You saw a sign that said Auschwitz? 

  

A: Yeah. 

  

Q: Yes? 

  

A: On -- on that building, the railroad sta -- therailroad -- the -- the ra
ilroad station. And one 
of those wild guys saw the two boys who were with me , and he asked them how old are 

you?  And they say 15. He said, ﬁYou are 18.ﬂ
 Without explaining why he said it, and 

where they should use it, and was also a ma
n -- well, there were several me n supporting 
themselves on a cane, and the same  guy told 
them, don™t come  out w
ith a cane, leave the 
cane here. Also, not saying why, so I™m sure th
e guy didn™t listen, if 
he needed a cane to 
support themself. And we were put on five 
abreast lined up, the whole contingent. And 
we were mo ving forward, and you can -- forward I saw two SS unifor me d me n with 

white gloves. And when my -- when I was in th
e first row, they went
 to the -- through the 
five, and he just looked at me  and wa ved me
 to one side. And the boys were next to me, 
he asked them, ﬁHow ol d are you? ﬂ  Now it lit up in their head, and they sa id 18, and it 

was their luck because he send them to th
e good side. So then we were -- when there 
were enough people together, we were ma rche
d along a -- those barbed wire fences. And 
there was a guard, a SS with a rifle over his sh
oulder walking at [indecipherable], and I 
naively asked him, ﬁ What are those chimneys
? ﬂ  They™re not only smoke comi ng out, also 
sparks, and fl ames. I didn™t smell anything, and he
 said, ﬁOh, that™s the bakery, they must 
have burned the whole load of bread.ﬂ  
  

Q: You didn™t smell anything? 

  

A: No. It could be the wind wa
sn™t comi ng in my direction. 
  

Q: But you were in Birkenau? 

  

A: Birkenau. 

  

Q: Mm-h m 

  

A: And until we met some veterans, didn™t fi nd out
 what this -- these chimneys are. We were 
brought to a huge hall, with nothing in except 
benches around, and pegs on the wall. And 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
102 
 
 
the pegs were numbered, and we were told to
 take everything off and hang it on a peg, 
and reme mb er the number, so you can get back to
 your clothes. Till th
e last mo ment were 
deceptions. And everythi ng you have  in your pocket, throw -- there™s a blanket on the 
ground, throw out everything. 
  

Q: And who™s telling 
you this?  Are these -- 

  

A: SS. 

  

Q: SS. 

  

A: These were SS people. Throw everythi
ng down. And don™t let us find anything on you, 
you™ll get severely punished. Then we were sh
aved, every hair on our
 body, and with me  
they had a lot of work because top of my
 head to the big toe, I™m hairy. And -- 
  

Q: And they shaved all over your body? 

  

A: All of the body, and then they
 did it with -- they never chan
ged the blade, that was dull, 
they were pulling the hair, and ripping the sk
in, and after that, we were washed down 
with some  disinfectant that burned in those 
scratches. And then 
we were brought into 
shower. Hot water, nice shower
ing, after three days in fil 
-- filth. There was no food the 
three days, and we still were not eating befo
re the shower. And from there, not comi ng 
back to the peg, but another door
, they chased us out, naked a
nd wet from a hot shower in 
the cold, wintry night, to another barrac
k, and then we™re ma rching along a counter, 
behind which some  prisoners were sitting and th
rowing at us a pair of pants, a jacket, and 
a pair of boots. And the hat to take off -- not 
a hat, a cap to take off when you me et an SS 
ma n, it was for no other reason there. And those --
 that clothing was w
ithout regard to our 
size. So it was up to us then to exchange 
it so it fits. And we we
re brought to a barrack, 
and I™ve no idea where I was in Birkenau, I coul
dn™t -- couldn™t identify where we were. 
But the kids were with me, the two, and 
we were not working while we were in 
Auschwitz, in Birkenau. During the day we were just in front of the barracks, hanging 

around, loitering they call it. A
nd [indecipherable] we went 
for the soup and the bread. 
But every other day, or some times every day, and some ti me s over three days break, 

people came to look for workers in their fact
or ies. Civilians accompanied by an officer. 
And we wanted to get away from those ch
imneys, so whatever, whoever they were 
looking for, we applied or [ind
ecipherable] and we  got away to a welding job, they were 
looking for welders. There were 350 of us, and 
at that point, when we were accepted to 
become wel ders, they starte
d to tattoo us, the numbers. 
  

Q: So your -- how long are you in Auschwitz before -- 

  

A: I have no idea, but I know it --  

  

Q: Week? Two weeks? 

  

A: -- I know it wasn™t long. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
103 
 
 
  
Q: Wasn™t long. Could have been a few days? 

  

A: Yeah. 

  

Q: But you were eating? 

  

A: Yeah. 

  

Q: Yes, they were feeding you?  So once you s -- 

  

A: Yeah, Auschwitz diet. 

  

Q: Right. Wors e than the Terezín diet, right? 

  

A: Mm.  

  

Q: So once you decide that you™re goi
ng to say that you™re welders -- 
  

A: I said anyt hing I was --  

  

Q: Anything,right. 

  

A: -- but before they came to me
, they had their contingent -- 
  

Q: Right. 
  
A: So-- 

  

Q: So then they tattoo you? 

  

A: Yeah. And now if you were psychology PhD,
 I would ask you a que
stion, but I have to 
live without the answer to that. There were
 three guys doing the tattooing, and I was at 
the edge of my life, or edge of death, or wh
atever you call it in Auschwitz, and I went to 
see which one does it the nicest way. And in
 that line I lined up. I™ve seen guys with, you 
know, irregular numbers, b-big ones, small ones,
 sideways and so. I wanted to have it 
neat. 
  

Q: Can you show us your number? 

  

A: I can show you this, and it™s very regular 
and neat. It has to be read this wa y, I don™t 
know why they didn™t do it here. 
  

Q: Yeah. 

  

A: 11636. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
104 
 
 
  
Q: It™sE11636. 

  

A: Yeah. 

  

Q: Mm-h m.  

  

A: And from that mo ment on -- I don™t know 
when in Auschwitz they called us by a name, 
but they must have, because people who were 
with me , I know in alphabetical order, they 
have either higher or 
lower number. So -- 
  

Q: So you must have been lined up alphabetically. 

  

A: Alphabetically either by name , or they ha d documents, I -- I™m sure they had docume nts, 
because they came from Terezín, the documents came along. 
  

Q: The docume nts came to Auschwitz from Terezín, so -- 

  

A: Yeah, the names of
 -- of the deportees. 
  

Q: And were cards ma de out for you 
in Auschwitz, do you have any idea? 
  

A: No, nothing was -- I -- I have no -- nobody 
asked, interviewed, nothing. Th-They ma y 
have called my na me , I don™t reme mber that pa
rt. Just judging by the 
fact that I -- those 
whom I mee t , whether their name starts with 
a lower or higher letter 
in the alphabet, they 
have a lower, or higher number of the -- 
  

Q: Right. 

  

A: --thetattoo. 

  

Q: I think we have to st
op the tape and change it. 
 

End of Tape #9

Tape #10 
  
Q: So you™re in Auschwitz for a few days. Do you hear the orchestra when people -- 

  

A: No, not in Auschwitz. 

  

Q: Not in Auschwitz? 

  

A: No. Although I read later on that they suppos
edly played upon arrival for the -- for the 
arrivi ng prisoners to -- still to give them
 a -- an impression that they™re co mi ng 
some where to a spa where the orchestra plays fo
r them. But I -- I have not heard or seen 
the orchestra in Auschwitz.  
  

Q: I see. So when people we re goi
ng to work, you didn™t hear anything? 

  

A: No. 

  

Q: And were people near you in the barracks going to work? 

  

A: No. 

  

Q: Going in and out -- no they weren™t? 

  

A: No that was -- that was just t
hose who waited to be taken away -- 
  

Q: Isee. 
  
A: -- for jobs.  

  

Q: And where were you sent?  Aft -- after your tattoo, you weren™t -- you had the same  
clothes, the same  shoes, but
 they just tattooed you? 
  

A: Yeah. And we went to -- 
by tractor, or we walked, I don™
t reme mber cause I forgot. We 
went to the train, by whatever me thod. It 
was the same  cattle wagon, and we were going 
to Gleiwitz, which is nearby, and it also took 
longer than it should have taken because the 

military transports had pr iority on the trac
k. That™s why it took three da ys to go to 

Auschwitz, a trip that shouldn™t have 
taken longer than five, six hours. 
  

Q: But you -- you were in Auschwitz before the uprising, right? 

  

A: Yeah. 

  

Q: The uprising the end of October,
 so you have left  by this time. 
  

A: Yeah, I think so. 

  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
106 
 
 
Q: Yeah. 
  

A: Yeah. 

  

Q: So they take you -- 

  

A: You mean the crematorium -- yeah. 

  

Q: Yeah, yeah, the blow up, yes. So you™re 
by train to Gleiwitz. And what happens when 
you come  to Gleiwitz? 
  

A: From Gleiwitz we marched through the stre
ets, into the camp, there™s a huge camp. And 
the whole camp was -- all inmates in that ca
mp were working in a -- a railroad repair 
shop that was fixing wagons that were dama ged 
by the Royal Air Force on the way to the 
front. So with my experience, I did get a -- 
a cutting torch, at the ga
te, cutting off all the 
dama ged pa rts of the wagon, and then the wagon we
nt further on to be -- to -- to parts to 
be measured, and re-install the good parts. 
And the job had a good side and a bad one. 
Everything in life, I guess, has a good and 
a bad side. The good one was when a wagon 
with garbage came in, I had the 
first pick. The bad part was th
at was in the open gate, and 
we had nothing, we had no underwear, no socks, 
just those cotton pants and the -- and the 
jacket. And -- very cold. My me ister was 
a -- a Pole -- a German Pole, or a Polish 
German. A Pole of German nationality. He 
wasn™t especially good, but he was one of 
those who was afraid to be good. He wasn™t -- 
he wasn™t very bad, but y -- we worked 12 
hour shifts, six days a week, one week day, one
 week night. And when we went to work 

there was music in Gleiwitz, and when we came back was music. 
  
Q: Musicians sitting outs
ide, or walking -- 
  
A: What? 

  

Q: Where were the musi -- or  was the -- 

  

A: Next to the gate, standing -- 

  

Q: They were st anding near the [indecipherable] 

  

A: -- the musicians were standing next to the ga
te as we came in, and if we didn™t ma rch in 
proper step, we were helped by a kick to im
prove the step. Big guys like me  deteriorated 
in Auschwitz much faster than the little 
skinny ones. I guess our body required more than 
they were offering, and a lot of pussyboils pr
esented themselves on my ba ck. And the pus 
rubbed off on the jacket, and when it dried, 
it rubbed back into the wounds. I also had 
some  that were not opened, were -- the skin
 didn™t break and the pus was pushing, and it 
was terrible pressure, and they were very pain
ful. And I didn™t want 
to go to the infi rmary 
because the Germans di dn™t like si ck Jews, they
 liked them less than the healthy Jews. So 
-- but it became  unbearable, so I went. And 
there was a French doctor, I don™t know 
whether he was a doctor, or just filled the pos
ition of a doctor -- a --
 a prisoner, and he -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
107 
 
 
for anesthesia he put me  down on a table face down, and for anesthesia he  used three 
guys, two sitting each on one of my a r ms , a
nd one sitting on my legs, and he proceeded 
to open those closed -- it wa
s a split second unpleasant, but 
there was immediate relief, 
the pressure was gone. So you bite your te
eth together, and -- a
nd I went immediately 
back. There was no -- no bandage, no stitch
es, no nothing, just cut open, relief, and I 
went back to the barracks, and next shift I went to work.  
  

Q: Andyou™rewelding? 

  

A: Pardon? 

  

Q: You™rewelding? 

  

A: Welding, no, cutting with a torch. I™m not -- 
welding is putting things
 together, I was -- 

  

Q: Together, you were cutting things --
 and the two boys we
re also with you? 
  

A: Each one, yeah. In -- one in the carpentry 
shop, he -- because one worked in -- in Terezín 
in the carpentry shop, cause 15 and older had 
to work, and one of them was carrying the 
plumber™s toolbox. So -- and they found similar 
jobs. Whether they said what they did 
before, what their experience was -- I couldn™
t say what my e xperience was. And that 
second cook was in that same  transport, and 
he came  also to Auschwitz into Gleiwitz 
from the same camp. 
  

Q: Really? 

  
A: Yeah. And so one day on the way home  -- th
ere was nothing -- I went
 -- we went full to 
e-elaborate on that job, other 
than only once in those 12 hours you were allowed to go to 
the bathroom. They took your number down, a
nd if you came again, th
ey kicked you out. 
The guy who was there was called scheiss me
ister. [indecipherable] to spell it. 
  

Q: She ma y know how to spell that. 

  

A: I -- I don™t know what people did who had diar
rhea, but there must ha
ve been people with 
diarrhea. I have no idea. Th -- one day was really
, really sick, tired a
nd -- and I -- I really 
couldn™t perfor m. So I found a place, and with
 these radiators with the ribs, you know?  
There was one that allowed a little space be
tween the wall and itself. I leaned down 
behind it, and there was nice, warm, and I fell 
asleep. It wasn™t difficult for me  to fall 
asleep until I™ve been awakened with a -- a 
rifle butt by an SS ma
n. I think the -- the -- 
my meister must have told the guard that hi s 
helper is mi ssing. So he found me . I™m gl ad 
I™m not bald because I have a very ugly prot
rusion still, on my head. And so he kicked 
me  in the behind and sent me  back to work. 
I was lucky he didn™t deport me . So I did my 

work again, you know, you get this kind of enc
ouragement with a boot, you continue to 
work. One day after the shift, we go back to
 camp, there was a snow on the floor -- on the 
ground. And I had wooden shoes, those Dutch w
ooden clogs, that was the only shoes that 
fitted me , that I got exchange. They were good -- a good and the bad si de. The good was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
108 
 
 
it insulated from the cold of the ground, but
 uncomfortable because they were not 
flexible. Walking back to the camp, I see 
ahead of me a huge -- only maybe it just 
seemed that -- that huge to me , onion on the 
edge -- on the side of the road. So I look 
back where the guard is, and told the guy be
hind me , step a little bit out of for mation, 
cover me . And I bent down, and picked it up an
d put it in the jacket  to take it to camp, 
because whatever either one of the three of us
 found, stole, or  otherwise, we  shared. So I 
took it in to share it with th
em. And we were brought in a
nd lined up on the roll call area 
for frisking. We were frisked on -- infre
que -- not infrequently like little, but 
unannounced because we  were working with tools, and we could have ma de some  
weapon, a knife, or -- or some thing which the 
Germans did not like very much. So what 
do I do with the onion?  If I throw it aw
ay and don™t say it was me, everybody gets 
punished, the old theme of collective punishme nt. If I say it wa s me , they beat me  to a 

pulp because  they won™t believe  I found it, they 
will think I st ole -- they will insi st  I stole 
it. Only one way out, to eat th
e onion, quickly. This is with 
the peel and with those little 
roots on it. The eyes were -- tears were
 comi ng down my cheeks, and the nose was 
running, and sweat in that co
ld, wintry day, sweat was co
mi ng up on my forehead. And 
when he ca -- I finished it before he came  to
 me , a nd I didn™t dare to breathe while he wa s 
frisking me . And why I am saying it is a day or 
-- or t -- the next 
day or the day after, 

these wounds started to ge
t smaller and less pus-y. 
  

Q: Really? 
  
A: The one onion did a ma rvelous job. But it 
was only one, and we continued days and 
weeks without another onion, so it opened
 up again, and the -- th
e pus-y routine has 
reappeared. But it gave me  enough r e spect for on
ions that I am consumi ng an awful lot of 
them, cooked or raw. And recommending it 
to everybody. I don™t reme mber much of 
happenings inside the camp. This other 
cook, second cook from Prague, he had the 
chutzpah on a -- in -- on the -- 
on the road in the camp, to stop the camp commander, who 
was a s.o.b. you can say, no?  That™s in public. 
He was the -- previously the commande r of 
the crematorium and the gas chambers in Auschwitz. And here was the lager 

kommandant, always walking with a dog. 
  

Q: And his name, do you know? 

  

A: Yeah, Moll. And he stopped him, he said, 
ﬁHerr Kommanda nt, I woul
d like to work in 
my profession.ﬂ And he said, ﬁWhat™s your prof
ession? ﬂ  He said, ﬁI™m a cook.ﬂ He said, 
ﬁDid you tell it when you came into this camp? ﬂ  He said, ﬁYes.ﬂ So next Sunday on the 

roll call, they pull him out and put him into 
the SS kitchen. I wouldn™t have dared to say 
I™m a cook when I said I™m a welder. I thought, you know -- anyway, he -- I never -- 

already the oldtimers in the kitchen, the vete
rans, they wouldn™t let him anywhere near, 
and he has to wash dishes, the floor, the ta
bles, just the dirty wo
rk. And one afternoon 
there was some  mashed potatoes left from 
the SS me nu, and he ma de like a decorating 
bag out of paper, and ma de some  decorations like for a cake. And the SS in charge of the 

SS kitchen was a baker, or a -- 
a -- call it baker patisseri e, or 
the fine -- fine baker, you 
know, the -- how do you call it? 
  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
109 
 
 
Q: Pastrychef? 
  

A: Pastry chef. What would I 
do without you?  Couldn™t complete 
the interview. He saw this, 
ﬁ Who ma de this?ﬂ And he said, ﬁI did.ﬂ 
ﬁYou did?ﬂ He imme diately ma de him the 
proviant me ister, which was in the storeroom, 
giving out to the cooks the -- the food, the -
- the -- the items to cook. So he had everyt
hing, he was in there alone, no other veteran -- 
prior veteran. He took care of everyone fr
om Terezín he knew. He saved my life. 
  

Q: Really? 

  

A: At 4:30 in the morning, behind the barracks, 
we crawled to that SS kitchen -- and several 
people, and he threw at us a -- a boiled potat
o unpeeled, or  a piece of bread, or whatever 
was left over. And when I was at night shiftand couldn™t come  to the kitchen, he left me  

some food on the beam in the 
latrine. Not a very 
aesthetic place, but who cares? And all 
these things, whatever he sa -- left there we
 -- the three of us sh
ared. And I don™t think I 
would have ma de it without him. And so now
 again, nothing extraordinary. I was lucky, I 
was never present at -- when there was so
me  hangings, or when some body got 25 or 40 
lashes. I never -- when I -- when we stood in 
the roll call place, I bent my knees not to 
stick out, because I was tall. Cause they -- th
e tall ones and those who were in some  way 
different than the rest, they pulled out for the 
nice jobs like cleaning 
latrines, and so -- so 
you learn how to survive. 
  

Q: And are you now hearing rumors about the wa
r, that the Russians are getting closer? 
Because it™s now what, November or December? 
  

A: It was January already. 
  
Q: It was January already by this time , okay. 

  

A: And we did hear faint expl
osions like bombs and so. And one
 day at n -- noon -- before 
noon -- before noon at the factory, over the 
loudspeaker came  an announcement, all 
prisoners assemble where we usually assemble
 after the shift to go back. And there was 
not much talking. They counted us and ma
rched us back to the camp. No music was 

playing. Lined up on the roll call area. After awhile
 we were sent to th
e block -- to have -
- to enjoy our own luxury, each one had a bla
nket. We  brought our blanke t and it was a 
godsend because we could wrap it around and be 
a little less cold. And soon thereafter we 
were ma rched out. That was already after
noon, again without music, and that was the 
beginning of what they call a death ma rch today. With the kids on my side, we are 

together. And there were no more kids, they 
were already adults, you 
know, this kind of a 
circumstance ma tures a person quickly. And -- 
  

Q: Are you still wearing -- 

  

A: Theshoes. 

  

Q: The -- the wooden shoes? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
110 
 
 
  
A: Yeah. 

  

Q: Yeah. 

  

A: And so we ma rched until late at  night, and we ca me  to an already abandoned camp, 
evacuated -- another evacuated 
labor camp. So we were herded in, and right went into the 
bunk and fell asleep. There was no food, no drink. 
We  were able to pick up some  of the 
dirty snow from the road. And early morni
ng I was -- it was not -- before dawn, they 
woke us up, and the Germans insisted that we 
go as quickly as possible. Now, we noticed 
whoever fell, couldn™t make it, was shot on the 
road. On the first day with one of the kids, 
we were supporting one who couldn™t road 
-- couldn™t walk any more, you know, the 
shoulder, and under the arm. And we could do it as
 -- as long as he could move his feet -- 

his legs forward. But then he became totally heavy, we had a dead weight, and we 

ourselves were already weak. So we just coul
dn™t continue to drag him, and then when 
we heard the shot it was like -- it felt li
ke I was shot, you know, the -- the guy -- I felt 
guilty that time, I felt guilty 
that I didn™t try more. But it wouldn™t have helped, I could 
have only weakened my self, and wouldn™t have helped him.  
  

Q: So you both let him go, r i ght? 

  

A: Yeah. 

  

Q: And then you heard a shot? 

  

A: Yeah. And then the next day after this 
camp, we were ma rched again, there was no food, 
no drink. Continued with the dirt
y snow, and at late at night 
again, we came  to a barn. We  
were herded in, the -- they -- they closed 
the barn. And that was nice because there wa s 
some thing, we didn™t recognize it in the dark, 
hay or straw. We crawled in and had a 
warm, soft sleep. On that day my -- on top of
 the shoe where the laces are -- there are no 
laces on the wooden, but on where on other shoes 
are the laces, a little triangular pi ece 

broke out, and two sharp corners were digg
ing into my foot. And that was very 
unpleasant. I don™t know where and how I found a 
piece of wax cloth, I think in that barn 
or around it, and I wrapped my feet into th
at, and that™s like McDonald uses this 
checkered tableclot h?  
  

Q: Mm-h m.  

  

A: That kind of ma terial. It did 
not insulate me  any more from 
the cold, but it didn™t hurt like 
the -- that shoe. But early in the morning on th
e third day I felt -- I -- I will be one of 
those shot on the road. I am weak, tired, tough 
trying to drag my feet. And the kids we re 
in -- in fairly good shape, because I me ntione
d the smaller ones and skinny one tolerated 
it better. So I said, if I stay here, I get shot
. I try to escape. Whatever  chance I have, I will 

take it. If it™s 10 percent, 
I™ll take 10 percent of success to
 escape. And so I told them, 
stay together and help each other if you need
 to, and I can™t any more, and I have no use 
to you anyway. So we come  to a fore st, tall 
forest on both sides of the road, no moon, real 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
111 
 
 
dark. So that was the mo me nt. I slipped to -- in
to the ditch on the side
 of the road. I don™t 
know why I didn™t encourage the ki
ds to do it too, but I felt I d
on™t want to be responsible 
in case -- you know, to suggest some thing wher
e they ma y suffer. And I laid down in the 
snow, face down. And there was -- must have been a zealous guard who shot me . And 
whether it was the dark, or whether it was 
frozen fingers, I don™t know. He shot me  under 
the arm, and the bullet got stuck in the rib. 
And the snow -- the -- the blood was color -- 
starting to color the snow, and that wa
s good, because nobody else attempted a second 

shot, that the guy must have had it, you know, but -- so when the column past, I suddenly 

had strength to pick myself up, and went 
into the forest, and found like mi nded people, 

other prisoners who escaped, ha
ving been lucky, not getting s
hot. So we huddled together 
and used the blanket in ma  -- outside in -- in Ja
nuary in the forest with this -- just a cotton 
uniform, and I think we all sl
ept, sitting, holding each other. 
And in the morning we went 
to the edge of the forest, that the road 
we came from, looking whether we find a sign 
where we are, what™s happening. And we see the top of the hill another camp. The gate is 

open, no guard in the watch tower, and prisoners
 walking in and out. So inside the forest 
we ran -- suddenly we could not only walk, 
we could run, near to that camp, and we 
asked one of the prisoners, ﬁWell what -- well 
what is this?ﬂ He sa
id, ﬁI don™t know, but 
before dawn, all the Germans jumpe d into ca
r -- into the trucks and took off.ﬂ Didn™t 
even take the time to liquida
te the camp, with machine 
guns, and -- and hand grenades. 
So what really happened, in that area, a Ru
ssian tank force cut a wedge into the German 
front. And of course they didn™t want to be ca
ught by the Russians, so
 they jumped in the 
trucks and left in a hurry. We  -- I went 
into the camp, and saw guys from our camp. I 
said, ﬁWhere were you located?ﬂ Sort of the la
st block, because that was the last group 
that arrived there. And I found the two kids th
ere, and we started to look for food, but we 
didn™t find any, because those who were ther
e already, they pl undered the -- the -- the 
potato storage, and all -- all other storages. 
But some body told us there™s, on the side the 
road, is a abandoned village where the German
 population ran the same  way as the SS, 
and there™s food in their pantries. So we went
 there, not far, and there™s food. Everything 
except br ead. They must have taken the loaf 
and bread and ran. The 
speed at which they 
ran wa -- showed itself. That was unfinishe
d food, even unfinished food on the table, and 
the rest was burned in the oven, or on top of
 the range. So we had food, and there was no 
-- at that time there was no refrigeration in
 Europe [indecipherable] I don™t know, a few 
people ma y have had a refrigerator
, and -- we want to break -- 
  

Q: I -- I -- 

  

A: -- at the refrigerator , okay. 

  

Q: At the refrigerator, yes.

Q: Edgar, you didn™t de scribe your wound and 
what happened, because it seems i mpossible 
that you were running after a night of bleed
ing. So what happened when you me t these 
people? 
  

A: I -- after I picked myself up from the 
ground, I was pr-pressing my arm against the 
wound, and lo and behold, among those in 
the forest was the French doctor. 
  

Q: Which French doctor? 

  

A: The French doctor from -- that operated on my back. 

  

Q: You™rekidding. 

  

A: No. And anybody who has some  function in 
a concentration camp has different degrees 
of privilege s according to the degree of the 
function. And it must have been his privilege 
to have a pocket knife, which we were not 
allowed to have. And people see that around 
this time  without other guys, just with snow 
as a some what numbing agent, and he had to 
ma ke another hole because the 
bullet was away from where 
it entered. And he pulled it 
out, wriggling and wiggling. And I continue
d to do the same  thing, holding my arm 
against the body until the blood dried, and -- a
nd later on I started to
 take advantage of 
my profession, and -- by feeding my self, I 
gained enough healing power that it healed 
without bandages, without stitches.  
  

Q: Really? 
  
A: There was no -- there wa -- there was no doctor -- 

  

Q: Did you eat more onions? 

  

A: Pardon? 

  

Q: Did you eat more onions? 

  

A: Okay, now we stopped before the bulle
t -- or that was af
ter the bullet -- 
  

Q: Yeah,yeah. 

  

A: We stopped in that village, and I me ntioned 
there were no refrigerators
 used. If this is a 
kosher tape I can™t me ntion it. People were -- 
had all kinds of preservation me thods of 
food without refrigerator. So the first thing 
I found was a -- like a gallon jug glass jar, 
with roasted pork, covered with rendered lard, which prevents the -- the oxygen reaching 

the meat, and the meat therefore, does not s
poil. And after months 
of Auschwitz diet, and 
three days absolutely nothing, I dug into th
at lard, and ate it like that. No bread, no 
nothing. And I still don™t understa
nd that this didn™t kill me
 faster than -- than the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
113 
 
 
Auschwitz diet. But it had a effec -- had it™s 
effects. This was a huge place, the -- that 
camp was called Blechhammer, and it was pa
rt of a huge industrial complex. All the 
camp inma t e s were working in it -- of for
ced laborers from occupied countries were 
there, and POW™ s were also there, and we
re working. We  found the camp of the British 
prisoners of war, and for some  reason -- they were bombing London, but for some  reason 

they were treating the Br itish POW™ s very we
ll. We found in that ba
rrack warm uni forms, 
boots, socks, scarves, caps, coats, and a lot of 
toilet paper, which saved us from result of 
the way we were eating. There were 10 of us 
in -- in one of those 
barracks, there were 
two toilets, one on each end, and that wasn™t 
enough. So they brought from the village, I 
don™t know, some where, a huge half barrel, li
ke a big whiskey barrel. I put two boards 
across so four could sit at the same  time. Th
at bad it was. I started to improvise cooking, 
and one guy was helping me , and eight did -- the 
rest of the 10, the ei
ght went to town to 
bring supplies. The one kid I me ntioned was 
working the carpentry shop in Terezín, he 
ma de a sled so more stuff could be brought. 
And there™s one point he brought the whole -
- took out from one of those houses a kitchen st
ove, including the pipe
s. He installed it, 
and then we were really cooking. The Russian 
soldiers came to eat, to us, because they 
didn™t get food like that. It was another comp
lime nt for the aunt. And we™re cooking till 
10 in the evening, and by 10:15, there wasn™t a bi
te to be had. That™s how we ate. No -- 
no control. And the Russian so
ldiers told us how wonderful
 Communism is, everybody is 
even, and it™s the best  system, until a Jewish offi cer came, a Russian Jewish offi cer, said, 

ﬁDon™t believe a word.ﬂ We were thinki
ng of Communism, because that™s a -- was 
presented to us as a real equal society, a so
ciety of equal people. Bu
t he set us straight. 
We were six weeks in that British barrack
s, because between wh
ere we were, and our 
home , they were still fighting. You know, from 
t he east front, we were here, and Prague 
was here, and the Russians were only getting th
ere. So for six weeks we suffered terrible 
diarrhea. And in spite of it, I gained 79 
pounds within six weeks, with my own cooking. I 
said -- what™s her name , I fi -- know this -- 
this diet advertiser, Jenny Craig would have 
gone crazy if she heard that some body gain
ed 79 pounds in six weeks. And everybody -- 
after six weeks we moved out of there, and 
went to Katowice -- here come  friend of the 
spelling. And they put us up in the schoolhous
e where or -- other -- other form of 
prisoners were. And the Polish Red Cross gave 
us identification papers based on what we 
told them, because we didn™t have anything 
to show. But we needed something because 
we were in the Russian occupied zone, and I don™t know how long we were there. One of 

the tenant wa s a chemist, and he found a job in a smoke factory there, to earn some  

money. And next day he come s and s a ys, ﬁCome with me , they need a cook in the 

employees cafeteria, in the ma nager™s restaurant
.ﬂ I have absolutely 
no recollection that I 
worked there, until I read one of the two kids me moirs, where he name s the factory. So 

the name  i mme diately sprang up, and I knew I 
know it. But even with that knowledge, I 

could not reme mber that I worked there. But 
I must have, because th
ey all told me, and I 
brought food to the school for them. So -- 
and I don™ know how long we were there. 
Some how time is not very noticeable, if 
you don™t have a calendar, you don™t have a 
routine, and that responsibility. Okay, and 
then we picked ourselves up and went home 
by means of fr eight trains, military trucks, 
horse-drawn carri ages, walking. We were 
already strengthened -- strong 
by that time . The day we mo
ved out from that British 
barrack, the diarrhea stopped lik
e immediately. And our digestiv
e systems started to work 
norma lly, cause we didn™t eat like pigs any 
more. Oh, there was a -- and one story, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
114 
 
 
it™s a funny story, one of the guys came  and sa
id down a little past the village is a pig 
far m, and a lot of pigs there, and nobody™s watching them, fe eding them. So I found some  

-- a little hammer and a piece of rope , and we said we go down and get ourselves a pig 

with the sled. And I go there, 
and there were lots of pigs
 running around, and they were 
in the building. So I found one, tied a rope to 
his hind leg, and tied th
e rope to the -- to 
that column, the supporting column, and hit 
hi m on the head, that™s how you kill pi gs. 
But the hammer was s mall, and I was not st
rong enough yet, and when you hit them here, 
it swells up and you can never br
eak his skull any more. So 
it was screaming there, and 
suddenly we hear machine gun fire. I -- oh my God, the Germans are back. So we look 

out, and on top of that farm, a Russian co
lumn, military column pass by, and one was 
shooting the pigs with a machine gun, and they 
were throwing them at cars and trucks as 
they ro -- drove by. And the guy sees me  with
 a knife, and commandeered me  to about 12 
or 13 pigs to eviscerate them. They want -- he
 wa nt only the meat, not
 the innard. So I did 
that, and I said, ﬁNow I worked for you, now
 you come  and shoot my pig.ﬂ And one of 
those wanted only the two hind legs, it was a [i
ndecipherable] soldier. So we had one and 
a half pig, and a innards from a liver, andthe organs from 12 more pigs. I don™t even 

know how we brought it all on that sled. We  we
re rendering the lard 
till 10 at night. And 
there was no worry about refrigeration, it wa
s cold enough. So that -- we consumed all 
that -- I™m s orry -- okay, we started on our 
way home  from Katowice, and we had to go -- 
I told you all the means we went, but I have 
to turn around to tell you -- to give you the 
direction. We were here, in Katowice. We  went to the Ukraine, to Roma nia, to Hungary, 

Austria and Prague. 
  

Q: That™s a long trip. 

  

A: Yeah. And in Ukraine was an office of the Jo
int, and they were givi
ng to Jewish prisoners 
some  onion. But you had to prove that you a 
Jew, so if you knew a [indecipherable] or 
some thing, a prayer, was fine. If -- some  of 
those who never learned anything, they had to 

take their pants off to prove they are Jewish. And -- 
  

Q: How did wome n prove they were Jewish? 

  

A: That was my question. That was my questi
on and still is. So came 
to lac -- I think two 
days after, one day or two days after the wa
r officially ended, and right away I went to 

Terezín to see if my par e nts ar
e there, and they were there. 
  

Q: Were you shocked? 

  

A: No, i -- when some thing nice happens, you don™
t get shocked. I asked Mother, ﬁWeren™t 
you worried? ﬂ  ﬁNo, I knew God wouldn™t do this to me. He will send you back.ﬂ Such a 

strong belief. She didn™t -- it™s [indeciphera
ble] it™s good, I mean a good disposition. 
  

Q: But your father was worried? 

  

A: Father was worried and he was -- he
 was very excited to see me back. 
  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
115 
 
 
Q: To see you, yeah. 
  

A: There was meanwhile a quarantine in Terezí
n because some  of the death ma rchers wor -- 
were brought near there, from Poland to Ma
utha usen, either through the Czech territory, 
or right outside, where Te rezín was the near
est place, so they brought all these sick 
people in, including the dead. Th
ere was a crematorium in Terezín. They started first, 
when few pe ople died, individual 
graves. My grandmother is in an individual grave. Then 
ma ss graves, without -- without coffins b
ecause the Germans wouldn™t supply wood for 
that. And when that wasn™t enough space for ma s s -- more ma ss graves, they built a 

crematorium, and the bodies were cremated. 
So I [indecipherable] was a quarantine, and 
people brought in typhoid, and 
scarlet fever, and all kind. And I must say, my wife, I 
don™t know how she did it, they were friends fr om before, that™s wh
en they started to 
believe what happened. Her friends she has fr
om before, one in one place with typhoid, 
one with the scarlet fever. This one couldn™
t eat, so she took his f
ood to the other one, 
and she never got anything, and was lucky. I 
went home, and started to look for an 
apartment, and there was a -- you know, you couldn™t like here go to some one, to a 

landlord and rent an apartment. That wa
s all operated by a -- a housing cop -- not a 
cooperation, a state housing office. And they
 didn™t come  Tuesday, come  Wednesday, 
come  the afternoon, come day after. I said, 
ﬁWhat the hell happened?  The Jews didn™t 
come  back. The Germans you have expelled, wh
at happened to the apartments? ﬂ  I was 
too di -- naïve and dumb to know that he want
ed some  -- some thing for the apartment. So 

it took almo st two weeks before 
I lost my patience, and I to
ok a chair and banged it on his 
desk, the desk collapsed, and I said, ﬁAnd you 
are next.ﬂ The -- ﬁWait, wait, wait, ma ybe 
we can find some thing.ﬂ In the afternoon I had 
a apartment and I was ma d at myself that I 
waited with this -- with this extended patien
ce, that I waited that long, I could have had 
an apartment two weeks before. So then 
my parents came and -- thought you said you 
wanted this after -- at another time, or 
just so long -- as long as the tape runs? 
  

Q: Well, let™s see, how -- how much more 
time  do we have on the tape?  Oh, well let™s 
continue a little bit. 
  

A: Yeah. So -- 

  

Q: Do you bring -- do you bring 
your parents from Terezín? 
  

A: I brought the parents from
 Terezín and now we -- I don™t know where we got some  
furniture. Maybe the house -- th-the apar
tment was furnished, I don™t remember the 
details. But I took two jobs because I needed
 to earn enough money for the three of us, 
and provide the things that we
 did not have after comi ng b
ack from Terezín. So one job 
was where I took my apprenticeship, a day job, 
and then I worked in the evening in a 
restaurant  where they also had the bar. And that
 -- there I worked at -- at night, and a lot 
of people who returned came to 
that evening restaurant and to the bar. And in October 
™46 -- until October ™46, when 
I was in inducted into the Czec
h army as a reserve, in the 
reserves, cause I was older than inducting 
age, for five mont hs. And somehow, a United 

Nations request to the ot her st ates was to 
reduce the military, the numbers in -- of the 

people in the military. And the easiest  -- the C
zechs and for others, I guess, was to get rid 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478

of, was the shortest  ones in, because  they had 
not invested a lot of effort into them, and 
the others were already more valuable by ha
ving been trained. So I was let go on the New 
Year™s Eve, 1946. And then I worked in a hotel
 in Prague. I have a certificate informi ng 
me  and everybody else who wants to look at, that
 I worked there to their full satisfaction. 
I don™t reme mber the kitchen, the time  that 
I did work there, the people with whom I 
worked. And it™s a -- it™s an hot
el on -- on the We ncel Square. 
And -- and that™s it, I have 
a -- I ha ve a -- a [indecipherable] or certificat
e that I -- document that I worked there. 
Anyway, in the spring of ™47, I si -- 
  

Q: Don™t you meet some body New Year™s Eve, on 1946? 

  

A: Oh my God, this woma n. Yes, I did, so
me -- meet somebody. I thought she will tell the 
story. 
  

Q: But you me t  Hana, your wife, yes? 

  

A: Yeah. 

  

Q: At least the person who became your wi
fe, you didn™t know that [indecipherable] 
  

A: Yeah, one of the friends whom I also me
t in Terezín after I came  back, wi th a New 
Year™s Eve party in her sister™s apartmen
t, and invited me . I don™t know, I came  only 
back from the military, how I found out ther
e is a party, how she got to me, I don™t 
reme mber that. But I know that I went, a
nd Hana came with some body, who was another 
fr -- childhood friend, who was much younger th
an she. A he friend, but not a boyfriend. 
And also some body who came back alone. So th
ey went together, and I don™t -- didn™t 
know how tough it will be to live with her, bu
t somehow I started a re
lationship with her. 
And I -- I don™t like dancing, but 
I thought it™s what gi
rl™s like, so I invited her to dance. 
And she called the other girl, in whose house we
 had the party. ﬁEdgar wants us to come  -
- wants you to come  to dance.ﬂ And she said, 
ﬁWell why didn™t he call me  directly?ﬂ She 

said, ﬁI don™t know what.ﬂ So I was dancing 
with both of them, and I hate to dance, 
always did. But I thought it™s -- you know, inst
ead of the other introductory sentences. 
And then the second time I said, ﬁWould you 
like to come  without a chaperone? ﬂ  And 
some how we did, and we had a relationship 
until, I think a few weeks, I don™t know. I 
don™t know about time , she -- she reme mbers be
tter. She reme mbers even -- she said she 
could never -- you won™t have a problem [ind
ecipherable]. She even reme mbers what I 
supposedly promised 53 years ago. She still 
[indecipherable]. I ha
ve [indecipherable] 
cook, I want to be a good cook, and there was not much to cook with in Czechoslova ki a 

after the war. So I wrote to the Swiss Cham
ber of Commerce that I would like to work 
there in the comi ng season, and I started in -- 
to work in Switzerland. But before we -- I 
went to Switzerland, there™s anothe r thing I 
don™t like, I don™t like movies, because I can 
sleep cheaper at home. And she insisted she wa
nted to go to a movie. I said, ﬁI am not 

going,ﬂ Yes, and she want -- I 
said, ﬁIf you want to go, you sta
nd in line for the tickets.ﬂ 
And she did, and she came  with
 the ticket, and I said, ﬁY
ou know, ma ybe  we should not 
go, and should go to your apartment, have some
 other kind of fun.ﬂ And that was the end, 
she walked away, and I didn™t see her 
until I came back from Switzerland.

Q: And then you started up again. 

  

A: Yeah, I don™t know why, but some  -- some thing told me  to -- 

  

Q: Something told -- told
 you to [indecipherable] 
  

A: -- go -- to go and see her. 

  

Q: And you ma rried in 1949? 

  

A: Yeah, and then she proposed and w
ouldn™t take no for an answer, so -- 
  

Q: There you were. 

  

A: I™m in it. 

  

Q: Right. 

  

A: Forlife. 

  

Q: Well, I know there™s much more to say -- 

  

A: Yeah. 

  

Q: -- but I -- I think we™ll have
 to wait for another time. 
  

A: I thought, three o™clock, that™s
 nine to three, six hours, th
at™s six o™clock. You did a 
ma rvelous job, and these two guys, too. 
  

Q: Well ha -- they™re great. Te
ll me , if you can, how you think your experience affected your 
life?  Did it change you very much? 
  

A: Thecamp? 

  

Q: The camp, Terezín -- Terezín, Auschwitz, Gl
eiwitz. Did you become  a different person? 
  

A: I don™t think so, I -- I thi
nk I didn™t have time to reflect much. I [indecipherable] the 
Swiss took gr eat advantage of me  because fo
r a g -- a guy who wants to come , they didn™t 
ask me , I asked them, so I thought -- and I went 
-- I worked in the restaurants, when you -
- first in Interlaken, then in Lausanne, 
and in the [indecipherable] the hotel school, 
operated by the chef™s association. And in th
e afternoon, from two to five, when a hotel 
[indecipherable] five to work for the dinner, I we
nt to school there, and 
then I was in --  in 
Arosa for the winter, and from two to five 
I was cleaning. And next spring I went to 
Lausanne where I learned my French. And 
at that time the Communists took over in 
Czechoslovakia, and I didn™t want to go bac
k. And at that time Czechoslovakia, on the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
118 
 
 
Russian request, have supported Israel with se
lling arms, training pilots, and letting every 
Jew go who wanted to join the Israeli army, th
e Hagana. So I told my father I-I want to 
go to Israel, then we can [indecipherable] a
nd live a certain time  on the [i ndecipherable] 
there™s a ship. At that time  I already knew 
more about the Communists. So -- and bec -- I 
went to Israel and when things calmed down, 
they come  and joined me , about a year or 
[indecipherable]. They couldn™t ima gine to a --  
  
Q: Yes[indecipherable] 

  

A: -- foreign country, that just fi
nished a war. And so I went back
 and said, ﬁI stay as long as 
I can leave legally.ﬂ 
  

Q: Right. And then you left in 1950.  

  

A: And then as I said, she proposed, and some
how she got pregnant, and they had to close 
the border, and I didn™t want
 to go with a baby, because most people who left 
[indecipherable] with a baby to chlorofor m
 it, and so it doesn™t cry, and bring the 
attention of the border guard. So we left [ind
ecipherable] I worked in the Israeli embassy 
as a chef when I came back. And they helped me , and I helped them, because when the 

borders were closed, they were helping peopl
e who had no papers to move to Israel. And 
suddenly all the ways were closed, and some
thing seemed to ma ybe work, and I was the 
guinea pig, and [indecipherable] really volunteer
ed to find out, and it succeeded for the 
benefit of them and mi ne. 
  

Q: I know this is cutting your story s
hort, and you were in Israel until ™62 -- 
  
A: Yeah. 
  

Q: -- and came  to the United States, yes?  So th
e tape is going to run out
, so what I want to 
do right now is just thank you very much, fo
r a very long, and very
 interesting story. 
  

A: You don™t have to thank me , that -- this wa
s the longest presentation 
I ma de, and that -- it 
wasn™t complete ye -- isn™t complete yet, so
 what I™m glad that I have a -- a -- you know, 
when I speak elsewhere, I get ma ybe two 
hours, I™m happy. But here I could provide 
details and think about them, all not
 to -- it™s blin
king -- not to --  
  

Q: Right. 

  

A: -- not to think which deta
ils to leave out and so on. 
  

Q: Well thank you so much. 

  

A: It was my pleasure, no, it was refres
hing. A refreshing lunc
h, refreshing company. 
  

Q: Good.

Q: And this photo? 

  

A: This is my father. In Czech he™s called 
Aloise, but everybody called him sophisticatedly

in the front. It was about three, 
three and a half, four years old.  
  

Q: Andhere? 

  

A: This is me , Edgar in the first or second

grade school. I mean the grade school in German language. 
  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
122 
 
 
Q: And who is this good looking fellow?  
  

A: This is me  again, at age 15 or 16. We neve

doesn™t ma tter too much. 
  

Q: Were you already an apprentice?

o Haas, I think in 1943, I™m not sure exactly 
when.  
  

Q: And this one? 

  

A: This is a caricatur e, and th
e interesting part of it is that
 his signature is expressed in 
drawing of a hair, which is English for Haas. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
123 
 
 
  
Q: So is that how

A: [indecipherable] his name. 

  

Q: And this one? 

  

A: This is -- this picture I asked Leo Haas to 
do for me for my mo t h er™s
 birthday. I think it™s 
written the lower left corner, I™m not sure. I

had nothing else to give her so
 I gave her this picture. 
  

Q: And the date for this drawing?

A: March20. 
  
Q: And the year?

A: This is a pi cture of the Charles Bridge  in
 Prague, ma de by Fritta. I don™t know whether he 
ma de it from me mory, or from anot her postcard,
 but the interesting thing of it is that all 
the pictures of Charles Bridge 
are ma de from the other side with the Prague castle in the 
background. 
  

Q: And how did you get this 
photogr -- this painting? 
  

A: He gave it to me  as a -- 

  

Q: He gave it to you? 

  

A: Yeah. 

  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
124 
 
 
Q: And this one? 
  

A: This is ma de -- this is watercolor of 
a less known painter on the 
-- on the wall on -- on the 
outside, the town wall, facing 
the church in the background. 
His name  was Otto Samisch, 
S-a-m- i-s-c-h. 
  

Q: And when was this photo taken? 

  

A: This is in the apartment of the Ameri
can commercial attaché, Mr. Williams, where I 
worked as a chef and butler for his family 
in parties that he gave in his house.  
  

Q: Whatyear? 

  

A: 1946. 

  

Q: And what about this? 

  

A: This was after -- this pi cture was after i
nduction into the Czech army reserves, because I 
was a -- beyond the age of re
gular induction. Must have be
en between October first, 
1946, and the year™s end. 
  

Q: And who™s this? 

  

A: This is my mother in either 1947 or 1948. 

  

Q: And this is in Prague? 
  
A: Yeah. 

  

Q: And this one? 

  

A: This is my father in 1948, also in Prague. 

  

Q: And this photo? 

  

A: This is Mother™s 85
th
 birthday. I™m not sure where it is, but
 she™s there with her friends in 
Prague. 
  

Q: And this photo? 

  

A: This is a Friday night, Mother lighting th
e candles, with her headcover -- emergency 
headcover, in our dining room in 
Ne wton. And looking on is Hana, my wife. 
  

Q: Andthis? 
  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
125 
 
 
A: And this is the -- a caricat
ure, drawn by Leo Haas, of Hana™s father in Terezín, in 1943. 
And you can™t see it in this small dimension, 
on the bottom is a -- like a sheet of paper 
with a heading report, and a arm reaching out, 
chasing a cook. Because her father was the 
-- the head of the -- we call it economi c po
lice, whose charge it was to avoid, or 
mi ni mi ze, at least, theft in the ghetto. 
  

Q: And how old was your mother then, do you think? 

  

A: How long what? 

  

Q: How old is your mother? 

  

A: Oh my dear. Is there a year on it, in the pic?   

  

Q: No. 

  

A: There™s nothing that -- 

  

Q: No, there™s not. And Edgar, what is this? 

  

A: I have received this from somebody -- I hope he™s not mad at me because I don™t 
reme mber his name . This was ma de, and also 
Hana™s, in a jewelry shop that existed in 
Terezín, where the -- the prisoners ma -- ma de
 jewelry for the Germ
ans, and most of it 
was sent to Germany for sale. This is some  
scrap metal, I think, because it™s not silver . 

They -- on the top you see the cook that it wa
s you symbolize my profession there. And 
then the AK is the designation of the fi
rst transport, Aufbaukommando, which is the 
construction command, or constr
uction detail, and the 268 was 
my number, and I think it 
was in alphabetical order, organized. And on 
the bottom is the town emblem of Terezín, 
and the 1944, that™s when 
I must have gotten it. 
  

Q: Did you ever wear this as a pin? 

  

A: No. 

  

Q: No. 

  

A: No-- 

  

Q: Joan, could you put your finger in just for scale?  
Just so we can -- an id
ea as to the size of 
it. 
  

Q: Is that okay? 

  

Q: Yeah, it™s about four inches long.  

  

A: Yeah, little longer ma ybe. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0478  
126 
 
 
  
Q: A little less ma ybe, don™ t you think?  Ho
w lon -- how long do you think that is? 
  

A: I think it™s a little more th
an four. The -- each of these segments is about an inch -- 

  

Q: Aninch. 

  

A: -- and a half.
