HENRY COHEN 
April 23, 1996
 
 
 

01:01:02 

 

Q: So, let's begin with you introducing yourself. 

 

A: I'm Henry Cohen. I was born in Manhattan, 73 years ago, I'll be 74 in June, and I think I 
was born on Henry Street in lower Manhattan, the lower East Side. And I don't know 

whether I was named after the street or whether the street was named after me. 
 

Q: Tell us about your parents. 

 

A: My parents had a checkered career. They were both immi grants, they arrived from 
different communities in Lithuania in approximately 1907. My father was married at the 

time he arrived. And he and my mother met and they fell in love. And eventually they 

were married. But a lot of sturm und drang
1
 over ma ny years. And so I, I, I was born in 
1922, I have an older brother, 1919, he's 75, yeah, 75 going on 76 and I have a younger 

sister who will be 68 and from my father's first liaison, I had an older half-sister and an 

older half-brother. 
 

Q: What do you know about the towns Œ the villages where your parents came from and why 
did they want to come  here?  
 

01:03:08 

 

A: We ll, my father was born to a baker, and was himself a baker at a very young age. His 
mother died when he was very young. I've written a piece on this, incidentally, called "A 

Century of Time ." And his father rema rried a woma n who had two small children. My 

father, as a six or seven year old, recalled waking up to noise in the mi ddle of the night 

and seeing, some feet away in the kitchen area, by candlelight, his stepmother feeding her 

children. He would recall as a youngster, in that age group, six, seven, eight, taking rolls 

and bread from his father's bakery in the 
winter and putting it under his coat and running 
to the edge of town and trading with the Lithuanian farmers for milk and cheese. So it 

was that kind of poverty. He turned against his father, I guess partly because of that, 

partly because of the growing spirit of enli
ghtenment, enlightenment that was spreading 
in the 19th century. And he became an anarchist, and by 15 or 16 he was living in another 

town, owning a bakery of his own, hiding inside the bakery arms of the anarchist 

moveme nt Œ and ma y have played some  role in the Russian Revolution of 1905. Anyway, 

to escape that life and that situation, and probably the Russian draft, he fled to the United 

States, leaving behind a wife and one or two children. My mother came from another 

town, which, before she was born, had a population of about four or five thousand, but

there was apparently a big fire, which she had no me mory of. I picked this up at the 
Museum of the Diaspora in Israel. 
 

01:06:10 

 
The population of the town declined by half Œ 25, 3,000 people. And she was a child of 

very old parents who had previous marriages. So, at the time she was born, her mother 

was 50 and her father was 65. And, thus, by the time she was 15, her mother was 65 and 

her father was 80, and that was a family of butchers. And so, her mother and father 

decided to turn over their little butcher shop to a, an older sister who was married to a 

butcher, and in return for room for their stay, being taken care of in their old age. And the 

son-in-law, husband of sisŒ my mother's older sister, said he could take care of the 

parents, but he couldn't take care of young Sadie, age 15. So she was sent to America. So, 

it's a story of great poverty, the background. 
 

Q: Can you tell us both of their name s?  

 

A: What?  

 

Q: Can you tell us both of their name s?  

 

A: Yeah, my mother's name  was Sadie Sheftel, I think it was Shayne Rochel Sheftel, was the 
family name . And my father's name  was Avram, Abe, and, I think, I can't  quite sort out 

the grandparent's names. Chana Leah was his mother briefly, until she died. His father's 

name was Israel Feivel. My mother™s father™s name was, I had it and I lost it. 
 

Q: You'll remember it. 

 

A: Okay. 

 

Q: And the name s of the towns?  

 

A: My mother came from Ivye and my father came from Drozgenik which was a sort of a 
small spa. Interestingly enough, I've not been able to find material on Drozgenik in the 

encyclopedia, the Jewish encyclopedia, which has Ivye. 
 

01:09:05 

 
And I, some one at the New York Public Library gave me  some  alternative name s to try to 

trace through Lithuanian sources. Because for some reason, the Jewish sources don't have 

it. 
 

Q: What did your parents do here?  When you were little, how did they make a living?

A: Well, my father became a baker. My mother became a dressmaker. They happened to 
meet in a small tenement apartment on the Lower East Side. My father's older brother 
lived there with his wife who, it turned out, was a niece of my mother™s, but older than 

my mother because she had been born to some older half-brother and they had a little 

baby at the time. And to keep things going they had boarders. So, there was a group of 

ma le boarders in one room where my father stayed. And my mother stayed with two or 

three fema le boarders in the kitchen on the floor. And that's how they me t and shacked 

up. 
 

Q: And they spoke Lithuanian to each other?  

 

A: No, they spoke Yiddish, I think. They ma y have spoken Lithuanian, but I never heard it. 
Yeah, it was Yiddish all the way. And Œ but as a result of this upbringing, this parentage, 

we grew up in a secular household. I was not bar mitzvahed, my brother was not bar 

mitzvahed. We had a very strong Jewish/Yiddish education through Workman's Circle 

schools. And my brother even today prides himself that he doesn't  read the English 

version of the Forward, he buys the Yiddish version of the Forward
2
 and reads that. And I 
went through the Workman's Circle elementary schools, high school, and even into their 

semŒ the semi nary for several years. 
 

Q: Tell us what that is. 

 

A: Well, the elementary school was somewhere in the neighborhood. 

 

01:12:01 

 

Q: No, I mean the Workma n's Circle. 

 

A: Workman's Circle was a fraternal organization that was linked to the Jewish socialist 
moveme nt, the Bund
3
. And so, in, particularly at the high school level, when I was going, 
I was taught by very prominent, famous Jewish literary people, scholars. It was in that 

sense a terrific education and I was taught all the Yiddish classic writers. Mendele,
4
 
Peretz,
5
 Sholom Aleichem, Ash
6
, poets, but not taught Hebrew. And it was an anti-
Zionist education because the Socialists out of the 19th century were universalists. Anti-

stateism, stateists. And I Œ when I went into the Army in 1944, I was trained for the 

infantry, went to Europe, fought in the infantry, the whole German campaign. After the 

war ended in Europe, I got myself transferred to military government and it was at that 

time in the summer of 1945, that I began hearing about the Holocaust and reading about

it. And suddenly realizing that the political perspective that I had been taught in this 
Socialist system had really given me an empty political perspective for what was needed 

after the war. And so I sat down as a young person of 23, and I wrote a letter to one of the 

senior people at the Workman's Circle complaining about it, and protesting against it, and 

declaring that I would never set foot into Workman's Circle activity again. Because I felt 

I had been mi sguided, politically. And just as a mi nor passing note, by pure coincidence, 

in the last month or so, the Forward had a controversy going between the old Socialists 

and some  references in the Forward to Jabotinsky
7
, who was a right wing Zionist, the 
Socialists regarded him as a Fascist, so you get these articles and letters to the editor 

carrying on this old struggle with Jabotinsky. 
 

01:15:19 

 
So, I decided to sit down and write a letter to the Forward telling the story that I've just 

told you. And referring, by saying that the problem isn't the Socialist and Jabotinsky, the 

problem centers on the anti, the Socialist anti-Zionist poison in general, against Ben 

Gurion
8
 and Labor and Mapai
9
 and kibbutzim. So they printed it as the lead letter and the 
headline was "Socialist Anti-Zionism Œ Zionist Poison." So, I'm waiting for the responses 

to come  in from the Socialists now. 
 

Q: What, in what way had they mi sguide
d you?  What did you start learning about or 
realizing after the war that you felt you had been mi sguided on?  
 

A: They had trained, they had trained the Jewish 
side of me , the Yiddish side of me  and then 
not provided me with a coherent political platform for that cultural education. They were 

anti-stateist. They used to write diatribes against Theodor Herzl
10
 and Weizman
11
 and 
that group also. So, here we were in Europe immediately after the end of the war where it 

was clear that the survivors would have to go to a state and the only ones who were 

organizing to take them in were the Zionists from Palestine. They were the ones who 

were organizing the underground routes to bring them to European ports and transferring 

them to ships and sneaking them into Palestine. America was not open, the antiŒ there 

were no antiŒ there were no refugee immi gration laws at the time. So, in that sense, the 

other thing I point out in my letter is that is a result of comi ng to grips with this six 

months later, after I went into UNRRA, I could greet the Chief Rabbi of Palestine with a 

feeling of love and no mi xed feelings, even though I'm not a religious person.

I could go into a ma ss meeting of 2,000 people and hear Ben Gurion and be exhilarated. 
And I could deal with a Hasidic rabbi who was in my camp on a fellowship basis and 

what this opened up to me, finally, by virtue of my rebellion against the Socialists, was 

my all inclusive Jewish quality. 
 

Q: Just a little bit back because I think we need a few details about your time in the military. 
How did you go into it?  Where did you go at first?  What did you see and how did that 

affect you?  
 

A: Okay. There was period after I got my baccalaureate, well actually, I moved very quickly 
from my baccalaureate into my masters program of city planning, so I got a deferment or 

two. But a friend of mi ne and I were exploring because we knew eventually we'd have to 

go in. And I remember us going to a naval recruiting station, oh like 1943, let's say. And 

the fellow across the desk is saying to us, "Do you like a good fight? "  And we'r e; "uh, 

huh, uh," and, and then he's talking that they need people for LST, for landing ship tanks, 

you know, to run the boats. And we leave the building and one of us says to the other, 

"You know, I prefer terra firma, the firmer the better." So, independently of one another 

we were eventually mustered, not mustered, but taken in and within a month of my 

getting my master's degree, I was in the Army and in training and then six months later I 

was in Europe. I arrived at the beaches in France, moved to Belgium. What? 
 

Q: Theyear? 

 

A: 1944, then, September. And within weeks, tr
ansferred to, I was a replacement, transferred 
to the ninth Division at the Belgian boarder 
Œ Hürtgen Forest. And overnight the Hürtgen 
Forest had some very special qualities; it was a tall forest and what the Germans were 

doing was shelling and the shells would hit the tops of the trees and detonate and the 

shrapnel would come  down on you. 
 

01:21:06 

 
And one-third of the group that I came in, either left in one day, dead or wounded. So, 

that was my initiation into combat. But in any event, I guess it was probably by October 

began the onslaught against Germany. And I was with the ninth Infantry Division. Which 

it turned out, the irony is, that they were the occupying division of the area in which the 

DP camp I went later, was in. My battalion, my regiment, were my primary adversaries. 

And life is very peculiar and funny in some  wa ys. Anyway, so I was in battle for Aachen, 

Germany which is closest to the French border. I crossed the Ruhr River, Düren. I was in 

the Battle of the Bulge. We  then moved into the Rhine when that was over. And we were 

in Bad Godesburg which is just south of Bonn. Home  to ma ny governme ntal, German 

governme ntal offices. And one night, at four in the morning, five in the morning, word 

come s through that we've, the American forces have captured the Rema gen bridge and 

they have sent people over it and we are put onto trucks, and by 11 o'clock in the 

morning we'r e down at the site and we'r e crossing the bridge under direct fire from the 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0362

other hills. Like the Palisades in New Jersey, crossing George Washington, under direct 
fire, you could see the tracer bullets as you're running your way across the bridge. And 

we establish a beach head on the other side. Now, just to step back a bit, because I've 

since been back there and also a friend of mi ne in New York, was in the public relations 

unit of the division that took the bridge originally. And it's an interesting story about the 

difference between the American forces and the German forces. By that point in the war, 

Hitler was trying to run the war, removing decision making fr om his commanders. 
 

01:24:04 

 
In our case, what happened, was that a scouting group from one of the American 

divisions, moving through the woods, bypassing the city of Rema gen, came to the heights 

there above the river, they look out and they see the bridge is still standing. It was the 

only bridge still standing. And they get word back to the battalion commanders, to the 

regimental commanders, to the division commanders, and to the Army group and then to 

General Bradley
12
 , General Bradley reaches Eisenhower at dinner that evening and says 
to him, "Shall Œ which battle plan Œ shall I stay with the battle plan that we'r e on, or shall 

I start changing things, because of this disc
overy of the bridge standing?" And Ike says, 

"Forget the old battle plan, pour the troops across." Now, that was the flexibility in 

decision making by able people. And so, Bradley starts giving the signal, "Pour it on, 

getﬂ Œ he mobilizes all the different divisions under him, "let's pour it on." And that 

shortened the war by two or three months. And so Œ and I've since, incidentally, read 

historical criticism of the Battle of the Hürtgen Forest Œ basically, as an infantry private, I 

adored my commanders. I adored Bradley. I adored Eisenhower. I thought they were the 

greatest in the world. And, and anyway, I fought all the way to Leipzig. We  could have 

moved on to Berlin. But, as a result of the Yalta agreement, we didn't. And I, I feel great 

about having been a soldier. I feel lucky that I survived it, that I was never wounded. 
 

01:27:01 

 
It's all luck, there's nothing else but luck that makes a difference between wounded, dead 

and a standing soldier. I been, you know, battle after battle. I should, also, as an interlude 

here, indicate that there came a time in early April when we'r e moving towards the Ruhr 

Valley, that I got a pass, a three day pass to go to Paris. That was part of the rotation 

scheme . Letting different soldiers take a few da ys from the front line. And I went to Paris 

in April of 1945, a month as it turned out, before the war ended. And I'm walking Œ I'm 

choking up as I'm telling you this story Œ I'm walking along the Champs-Élysées, and 

word spread that Roosevelt had died. Again, you know, I believe all the things that the 

Holocaust people are saying about Roosevelt's inaction about the Holocaust, but, 

nevertheless, he was my Comma nder in Chief, and a soldier needs confidence that he's 

being well led, and so it was a very moving evening when word came through that he 

died. And then two days later I was back at the front. Yeah. Anyway, then because of my

prior education and settlement house experience, I succeeded in getting myself 
transferred to military governme nt. There I was promoted to Technician Fifth Grade. And 

I had terrific relationships with the military government, I don't know who. We were in, 

in a county, incidentally, Landkreis
13
, at Günzburg, which was between Ulm and 
Augsberg, and it happened to be the city, I didn™t notice at the, time, from which the 

Mengele family
14
 come s. I didn't know this. And as part of my duties for a few months, I 
set up a hospital for German wome n who were presumed to have venereal disease. 
 

01:30:02 

 
And it was in response to the American soldiers who were, came down with venereal 

disease and they'd have to give the doctors the probable source of their particular 

encounter. And you'd get a name, and I was the chosen one. I set up the hospital and then 

I would drive to the particular community and try to identify the woman. I mi ght meet 

with the local ma yor or police chief or whoever, "Who's Daisy around here? "  And I'd 

bring her in. And all the way she would complain, she's ﬁeine anständige Frau,
15
ﬂ she's a 
respectable woma n, and so on. And then I'd bring them in, go on the ward. We  had a 

group of nuns taking care of them. They were tested. Then by three days later they 

weren™t giving me any argument that they were respectable women. And, I remember 

once, a woma n, who we finally discharged, came into the colonel or the chief of the 

group, wanting a letter that she was a her husband was comi ng back from the 

Luft waffe
16
, she wanted some letter attesting to her this and that. And the major, colonel, 
calls me in and tells me about it and I says, "Look, all you can do is give her a letter."

Tape #2 
 
02:01:00 

 

Q: Just finish that last story about the hospital with the German woman, the one, what your 
supervisor said about the letter. 
 

A: Yeah. Incidentally, I noticed in my material here that I, I had a memo in my material that 
I've just looked at, I haven't even read it word for word. Which is my inspecting a Œ some 

hospital facility somewhere in this county we were in, which was a hospital for Jewish 

displaced persons. I have absolutely no recall about it. If you had asked me  had you had 

any prior contact with Jewish DP™s, I would have said "no." Because I've been asked that 

question before, but it appears, so I have like a five or six page me mo of an inspection of 

this hospital. And I've just done an essay for class about an inspection I made of Harlem 

hospital in 1961. It's a subliminal yearning I have. Anyway, so, anyway, that county 

experience was a very interesting experience. And, but then, I had earlier somehow, since 

when I was trying to transfer to military government, I put in at a number of places, so I 

was called to serve at Supreme Headquarters in Frankfurt military government. They had 

higher authority in the contact, so they overruled my local commander and I went to 

Frankfurt and there, because of my combination of German and Yiddish Œ two years of 

German in college, and Yiddish Œ I was used as a translator of German documents into 

English. 
 

02:03:16 

 
And then that must have lasted a month or so and I suddenly was told to go to Wetzlar 

north of Frankfurt to supervise the military government printing plant. That was printing 

military government documents. It was an old German printing force and I was there 

overseeing it. And in any event, during the, let's say, May or June period to October, I 

discovered probably some exchanges of correspondence that the head worker, the 

executive director of the settlement house that I had lived in for a year and a half while 

going to graduate school, was in Germany, and with UNRRA and he was in Munich. So, 

occasionally, once a month, I don't remember, on a weekend, I would travel from where I 

was to Munich, which wasn't  far, and I'd spend a day with him. And then, in November, I 

learned that he was leaving Germany for, the States. He was going into the State 

Departme nt Office of Refugee Affairs a
nd so, we rendezvoused in Wi esbaden one 
weekend, which was zone headquarters for UNRRA, and it was over that weekend, and 

his name is Dick Wi nslow, Richard Wi nslow. He later, a year later, two years later, 

became the Secretary General to the Unite States Mission to the United Nations, right 

after it was formed. A very able fellow. Anyway, over this weekend, he said, "What the 

hell is someone like you doing supervising the operation of a printing plant, when there 

would be so much more important things for you to be doing given your background and 

your interests? " 
 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0362  
9 
 
02:06:03 
 
You see, at the settlement house. my, one of my major assignments during the year and a 

half I was there, you had to do some thing in exchange for room and board, it was the 

South End House, was the second oldest settleme nt house in the country. It had been 

founded in 19 Œ1892 or 1893. He had to prepare a 50th annual report. He turned that 

assignment over to me. I went into all the historical files and books and reports and this 

and everything. I did the draft of the 50th annual report. This is how he and I became so 

close. Then he did some  revision and upgrading and this and that, and it was printed. And 

then I did other things in the settlement house community, I did a term paper for my 

master's program on city planning, on the S
outh End planning board. A history of that 
and what it did. So, he had a pretty good sense of my intellectual and practical interests 

of experience and then the following morning he brought me  into zone headquarters and 

Gertrude Richland(ph) was there from th
e Eastern Division. A ma rvelous woma n, she 
just died about two years ago in Santa Barbara. She later became Chief Public Welfare 

Officer in Wa shington, D.C. And they recruited me , signed me  up, and they had in mi nd 

for me  to go to Föhrenwald because the then director was a Canadian woma n, a fine 

woma n in ma ny ways, but having inordinate diffi culties with the Jewish DP™s. She 

seemed to be somewhat rigid and the plan was for me to come in, serve for several weeks 

as her deputy, and then two weeks later she would be transferred out and I would become  

the director. Anyway, thenŒ 
 

Q: Just before we get into that, I would like to just move back and get a sense of what was 
your feeling, when you were in the infantry, about the war?  What did you think you were 

fighting against, your contact with Germans?  And then as the information came out about 

the Holocaust, did you have any contact with it in anyway?  
 

A: Well, I guess I completely identified with the war effort. 

 

02:09:05 

 

Q: I mean, you can tell from the way I spoke a few mi nutes ago about Roosevelt, that I had 
absolutely no question in my mi nd or emotions about the purposes of the war. I had, I Œ 

because of my German Yiddish, even in doing combat periods, I was always being used 

as an interpreter whenever we'd capture German prisoners. So, I had a lot of contact with 

German prisoners of war, army, whatever branch they were from. I had a lot of contact 

with the German civilians. I didn™t trust Germans. Didn't matter what they said to me. I 

was always doing my job. You know. In some  ways, I have a one track mi nd and in the 

sense of being focused. And Œ then when we ended the war in Leipzig, I don't reme mber 

what date we arrived there, April 29th, 28th Œ May first Œ a week or two Œ week before 

the end of the war, they started Œ the commander started sending us across the river 

which is at Leipzig to a little peninsula there that's formed by another river and we were 

casing the joint before the Russians arrived and after a few days, there were tens of 

thousands of German troops running away from the Russians to the American zone. And 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0362  
10 
 
we'r e just a few soldiers, and they'r e arme d and we've got one rifle on our shoulder. We  
were ma rching thousands of German soldiers westward across the river. And I don't even 

reme mber how we got across the river. And so, I had a lot of contact. And down in the 

military government and in the county, I had a lot of contact with Germans. Remember, I 

was having contacts with the Bürgermeisters
17
 and the chiefs of police and the health 
officials and so on and so forth. But, in a certain sense, I was the conqueror, I had the 

power. And it's interesting to me, Katie
18
, and I don't understand it considering my 
background, but you've seen some  of the pictures. I was, here I was a private and a 

corporal, but in the pictures that I have of UNRRA, you see the qualities with which I 

express, I visually express authority.

So, you know, speaking to the DP™s, you can see, I don't know where it come s from. And, 

so, in my relations with the Germans and so on and so forth, ma tter of factly, I'm never 

hemmi ng or hawing, or beating the bush, I'm always going about doing my business and 

I'm, I, not ma king any judgments about them. 
This individual, that individual. A woma n 
has venereal disease, we deal with that. I was not with any group that was opening 

concentration camps, I was not with any group that was dealing with the SS or with the 

political dimension in terms of the war crimes trials that would later occur. I was not in 

that. Somehow or other in ways that I have absolutely no memory of, whether it's 
Stars 
and Stripes
, whether American Arme d Forces Radio, I learned about the Holocaust. I 
don't think anybody was sending me  the New York Time s or the Paris edition of the 

Herald Tribune, but some how I was in gathering. And it was obvious from what I did 

with regard to the Workman's Circle, that it was, it was working on my system. And that 

I had strong feelings about it. Oh, powerful feelings about it. And when one thinks later 

about my last encounter in Germany with Dick Wi nslow and a colleague who was 

leaving at the same time, Roger Masteude, they were telling me to come in, I didn't jump 

at it. I asked a lot of questions. It was a gradual, two day, weekend process. I was doing a 

lot of soul searching, incidentally.. Now that I think about it. Doing a lot of soul 

searching that weekend on other matters. I was soul searching about what I felt was the 

inanity and the corruption of many of the American soldiers I was running into. I Œ at Œ I 

mean, reme mber, I was an educated young kid, a City College
19
 graduate and proud of 
that, MIT
20
 graduate and proud of that. 
 

02:15:04 

 
And I was dealing with very Œ I was a private, I wasn't  an officer Œ and dealing with these 

people in various situations. And that was not
 what was giving me  my love for America. 
When I was running the printing plant I lived with some local group of soldiers. I was

not, I was attached to them for room and board. My unit was in Frankfurt and I could see 
some  of these guys were wheelers, dealers, black ma rket. We  were eating venison Œ 

where were they getting the fresh deer from?  So, here were very close friends, spirits, 

over that weekend with Dick and Roger Masteude. And I was just getting out all the pain 

of that experience to them. And I guess it was partly that accumulated pain as well as my 

Jewish identity that finally enabled them to convince me to do this, and for me to say 

okay. 
 

Q: Elaborate a little bit on that. You say your Jewish identity. Do you remember how that 
came into play?  Or anything you thought?  
 

A: Oh, well it's hard. It's my second nature. You know it's Œ people can't  understand this 
about me , because of my secularism and my lack of the bar mitzvah. I never touched foot 

in a synagogue, literally, until maybe 10 years ago. It was just not part of my background. 

Now, I do different things that bring me  into that, even though I can™t believe what 

they'r e talking about. For me, it's history, not religion. And I can identify with the history, 

I can extract philosophical meaning from it and, belief. And be proud of that and share 

the pain. No, I think that this small group of people has made an enormous, an inordinate 

contribution to the world and to world civilization. For a variety of reasons and so on. 

You know, when I was a junior at college, sociology ma jor, I was declared, whatever, an 

honor student. 
 

02:18:06 

 
An honor student was relieved of having to take certain courses for credit. But, in 

exchange, the honor student had to do a paper, a two year project. And submit it and that 

would complete the terms of the thing. And I did a paper on the Jewish ghetto as a form 

of either adaptation or a form of accommodation to the urban environment. Remember, I 

was an urbanist. And I spent a good deal of those two years in the library studying Jewish 

history. Going back almost 2,000 years in terms of Venice and Prague and other places. 

And up to Louie Wi rth's book on the ghetto, he is professor of sociology at the University 

of Chicago. I Œ in 1940, 1940, '41, I was studying the various ethnicity data and the 

incidents of different social economic i
ndicators and medical indicators of Jews 
compared to other immi grant groups. I immersed myself in that material. It was really in 

a sense, that piece of work that led me into city planning not vice versa. It was this 

feeling that if this history and this culture could lead to certain cultural qualities and 

changes, that made them so much better adapted to the urban environment than other 

groups, then maybe there's a volitional way in which you could do things in general that 

would improve the urban environment. And that's when I set in, I didn't know there were 

masters degrees in city planning at the time. I hardly, barely knew that there was a city 

planning commi ssion in New York. I began putting it together in my own head. I went 

out, I found that the University of Iowa was virtually the only university in the country 

that had two summe r sessions back to back. So, I applied and I went out to Iowa and I 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0362  
12 
 
started taking courses in what I thought were 
Œ one would want me  to know in order to 
put these things together. 
 
02:21:10 

 
I took a course in surveying. I took a course in civil engineering. I took courses in 

calculus. I took courses in spherical trigonometry. In order, back then, sometime in early 

August, I'm in the library and I'm looking at the Sunday New York Time s and 

somewhere I come across a little squib that, which indicates that Mass Œ MIT is going to 

start offering a bachelors degree in city planning. So, I write the chairman of the program 

a letter saying, "I already have a baccalaureate degree, but I would like to enter this 

program if you would give me certain credit for my past baccalaureate," and I get a letter 

back from him saying oh, they already have a masters program. I wouldn't have to take 

the baccalaureate, he would, with my background, he would admit me to the masters 

program. And he was then the one, he gave me  a scholarship, and he was then the one 

who guided me to the settlement house for, so I could live cheaply. My parents or I, we'd 

survive with food on the table during the depression, but that's how I got to the settlement 

house. And little did I know when this was happening that the chairman of the program, 

Fred Adams, was the son of the chief city planner who had, British city planner, who had 

done the ma jor New York regional plan of 1929, 1930. And, so it was, again, it was in 

that Jewish context, I mean, that stuff surrounds you and penetrates you. I didn't have to 

go to shul
21
 or synagogueŒ 
 

Q: Do you reme mber when you decided to take the job what you're thoughts were?  Perhaps 
some  of this was in your mi nd about, "I do know these things, ma ybe I could run a camp 

because I know about city andŒ" 

 
 

A: You know, the only part of Œ I say the only part of the experience that I didn't have, the 
content was no problem. The human relationships were no problem. 
 

02:24:03 

 
The analytic component was no problem. The listing of tasks to be taken care of was no 

problem. I come  across three pages of notes in my background stuff outlining all the, 

tasks to be taken care of. That was no problem. The only part of the experience that I 

didn't have was supervising other people. And Œ but I should add a thought here Œ which 

was, I just think of it, I never, I have not ma de this connection before, Katie. You have to 

understand, Sept Œ September, 1942, I'm comi ng from the ghetto in East New York, 

Brooklyn, from the entire ghetto of my life, and I'm moving into Boston, into a settlement 

house, with a group, not only with the staff, that has no Jews on it, but, but a group of 

residents who are also living there, none of, no one else of whom is Jewish. I'm the kid on

the block. And I make a terrific adaptation. They loved me. I was getting such love back 
from this diversified group of people Œ all of whom were older than me . It's like what I'm 

telling you, what I told you earlier, about my me ntors. I don't know how they, why, how 

they attached to me. They saw something in me. I never set out to get them as it were. 

And here the, we had, there was a Peruvian couple, or Chile, I don't reme mber. Chile. Oh, 

no. There was a Chilean couple, a Peruvian guy, two wome n musical students, one from 

Kentucky and one from some where else. People 
from Illinois and this and that. And they 
loved me . It was a supportive environment. So, I guess that experience of who I was in 

some way played into my ability to move into this international staff and manage with 

them. 
 

02:27:03 

 
Because you see, in a certain sense, intellectually, intellectually I was their equal. 

Analytically, I was probably ahead of most of them. Even in my ability to size up 

political situations. I was probably pretty good. Given, you know, given my military 

government experience of working, again, with the military. I haven't mentioned that the 

military government team must have included 15, 20 other people with whom I was 

relating all the time. Or when I was going into Frankfurt, into SHAEF
22
 and related, so I 
had a lot of relationship experience. So, I guess I overcame the lack of admi nistrative, 

working with older people, admi nistrative experience. And I must have had some 

charismatic quality that I don't, still don't quite recognize, 'cause I'm insecure, Katie. 
 

Q: Okay,nowŒ

Q: Paint us a picture, then, of that first day you were taken to the camp, were you in uniform 
Œ remi nd us how old you were, what did it look like to you Œ at first I presume some one 

mi ght have taken you around Œ what were your thoughts?  
 

A: We ll, the camp, I came in the mi ddle of January. I was wearing a new uniform. An 
officer style, you know. The camp consisted of about 280 buildings. It was built by the 

I.G. Farben Company to house slave labor that they were employing in a munitions 

factory in the woods to the south. The buildings, because it was for slave labor, were not 

typical detached, semi Œ detached buildings. They, they had no kitchen facilities, no 

cooking facilities. The only communal facility in each building was a toilet or two. They, 

the buildings consisted of one large room on the top floor, second floor, and one small 

room on the ground floor. Food was dispensed in a kitchen area. People would go, wait 

on line, get food, either eat it there or come back to the room and eat it. Having gotten rid 

of the slave labor, the Army took over this village for DP™s and it gradually became a 

Jewish camp before I got there. It was also cold. Bavarian winter is awful. I had spent the 

previous winter in the Black Forest Œ parts of the Black Forest. It Œ we slept outdoors, in, 

in fox holes. There was a constant flow of soldiers who, what did they call it, black, not 

black foot, black something or other, they's lose their digits, their toes, their feet. 
 

Q: Frostbite? 

 

A: No, there was another name  for it. I was cold, but I never suffered from that. But anyway, 
these winters are very cold. Anyway, I went around camp, I met the staff. I don't have 

much recall of that the first few days in that sense. I was absorbing. 
 

03:04:51 

 
Visiting the kitchen, seeing how they cooked. Visiting the hospital. We had two hospital 

buildings. And I don't reme mber now exactly, but
 within a week or two of my arrival, 
the, the, the cold was so substantial that it fr oze the pipes leading to the toilets. Four 

hundred out of 600 toilets were out of commi ssion. The area of the toilets became like a 

cow barn, like cow barns. It was awful. It was awful. It took several weeks to deal with 

the pipe problem. As someone said it, "gets worse until it gets better." But, you have to 

remember, and I'll, I'll, I'll be making notes on this along with, that that was happening to 

them eight and a half months after liberation. They were living under conditions like that, 

And, anyway, it was during that period that Jean Henshaw, the former director left. I 

assumed the directorship. And I should tell you, just somewhere in here, because I can't 

reme mber which come s first and which come s second. 
 

03:07:08 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0362

There was a subsidiary group attached to the team, we had a few people from Joint 
Distribution Committee
23
 attached to us, we had a group of three, four, five people from 
the Jewish Agency for Palestine. Remember, this is two years before the creation of the 

state. We 'r e now into February of '46, and, and also because of my background, I'd never 

dealt with Zionists before. The Army later accused me of being a member of Zionist 

organizations, but little did they know I'd never been in the Zionist movement before. 

But, nevertheless, there's this group. And they, after, we had a large house for the team, 

over 20 me mbers of the team. They came from Australia, Norway, England, France, 

U.S., elsewhere, I don't, and Israel, and Palestine. And we had billets. We  were billeted in 

a large house at the edge of the German town, which was called Wolfratshausen. And, 

and so, and we'd have breakfast there, some times lunch, and usually dinner. After dinner 

they invite me  to one of their rooms for a drink or whatever. And it was in the course of 

that, that I established with them and they established with me, very close relationships. 

But they, being sophisticated undergrounders, which I was not, at that time, start asking, 

you know, warmly asking me questions like you are asking the questions. "Where did 

your mother come from?  Where did your father? "  But that's all preliminary. They'r e 

sizing me up, could they trust me or not trust me?  You're not asking me questions like 

that in order to ascertain whether you can trust me or not, you're asking me questions for 

oral history. They'r e asking me the questions to ascertain, can they trust me?  And after 

several weeks of this process, it basically boils down to they trust me. They trust me. 

Okay. However, in underground activity, there's another rule. 
 

03:10:05 

 
And that is, you never share with anyone anything more than that person has to know. So, 

the person has deniability. Okay? So, I am not curious and they are not volunteering 

information. I notice things from time to time around the edges. Okay?  For example, one 

of them says to me  one, "I don't know, Friday or whatever, would you like to go to 

Salzburg for the weekend and hear some  music? " And I say, "Sure, but I don't have any Œ 

the appropriate papers." He says, "Don't worry about it." And, en route, we drive north, 

which was not the right direction, to Munich, 
and we stop in front of a building and they 
go inside, I'm in the car. I've given them some  of my papers. They come  out with 

appropriate visa papers and all of that to cross over and come back to the American zone. 

We  go to Salzburg, we drive to Salzburg. And we had a wonderful weekend. A month 

later, whatever, one of them says, "How 
would you like to go to Switzerland? " So, they 
were organizing my leisure time for me with false papers. I don't ask any questions. I just 

go along for the ride. These are the Jewish Agency for Palestine. The, Ben Gurion, at that 

time, was the chief executive of the Jewish Agency for Palestine. I get to know the zone 

chief of this group in Munich who years later, almost 30 years later, 25 to 30 years later, 

becomes, what do they call it, the director general of the Israeli Foreign Ministry. And, 

incidentally, and that's like 19Œ that was in '64, but then I discovered a few years later

that he lost a son, in the '67 war. So, it brings these things close to home. Anyway, that 
was the group. But I developed a closeness to the Joint
24
 staff, Stanley Abramovitch was 
a rabbi from England, Becky Althoff was a social worker from New York, and we had a 

ma rvelous woma n from Norway, Astrid Oksny. I tried to trace her some  years ago and I 

found out she had passed away prematurely. Then in early March, the Americans are 

blowing up things in the I.G. Farben plant. And in the process, they destroy the water 

main that is carrying water to the camp. And I start calling desperately for the Army to 

get water tanks in and do some thing. We  get a few tanks, the few tanks that come  in we 

turn over to the hospital facility. But there's no cooking that takes place during that, 

toilets again. Then by the fourth or fifth day, I am out of my mi nd, and I start calling my 

headquarters and so on. Finally, a general appears and that leads to, but it shows also how 

in a period of crises, how hard it was to get the U.S. Army to pay attention to a real 

problem. And now, throughout all of this, these trials and tribulations, we also have a lot 

of very positive things going on. We organize a theater. We organize schools for the 

children. There's a yeshiva. We have hospital going, children are being, babies are being 

born, at an enormous clip for that size population. We Œ We'r e running an agricultural 

training center to the south. Where they'r e learning how to work on a kibbutz. Now 

there's little, probably a little military activity on the side, but I don't know about it. But 

it's a positive education of these people who until the previous May, have lived under the 

most forlorn situations. The children are giving performances. The adults are putting on 

plays and they'r e starting to publish a camp newspaper in Yiddish, and a magazine. And 

we Œ there's established a camp committee for self governance and there's, there are 

elections for membership on the camp committee and 1,000 to 2,000 people are voting in 

the elections in order to make the camp committee representative. 
 

03:16:22 

 
And I'm dealing with them. And we have over 1,000 people employed in tasks in the 

kitchen, in the warehouse, in the transportation unit, in the hospital. We'r e employing 

people. We have vocational training activity. Machinery and other things; sewing, that's 

going on. There are a lot of positive emotional rebuilding efforts here. But, the food is 

basically GI issue. It's canned. It's not fres
h. They, the Army, doesn't  want to take it out 
of the German economy. There's three ounces of protein a day. Whether a piece of 

canned fish or canned chicken or this or that. You have it at one meal, you don't have it at 

any of the others. So, a black ma rket in food develops. And the Army is beside itself as if 

its going to destroy the German economy. But who's selling to them?  The German 

farmers. They'r e probably selling to some of the military government units to, so, but in 

order to prove myself, myŒ and, basically, I don't like black marketing. I was telling you 

earlier how I was reacting moralistically to black marketing among the soldiers. I didn't 

want Jews to be involved in the black ma rket, it offends me , it's a backwards step in 

community building.

03:18:14 
 
So, I have to do some thing. Now, it occurs to me  when I read all this stuff that, "How did 

they get the cows into the camp? " They were probably leading them past our DP police 

group that was on duty in the mi ddle of the night. What am I going to do?  But, at least 

once a month, I would get up in the mi ddle of the night. All by myself. I'd drive into the 

camp alone. I'd pick up a couple of my DP police at the gate and I'd start driving around 

the camp, looking for lights in the basement. If there were a light in the basement, it 

meant, usually, that a butcher was killing a cow. And on the 29 days of the month that I 

didn't come around, word would spread in the morning, "there's meat in 'x' building, 'x' 

street," and people would start flowing and buying meat. I don't know where they got the 

money, whatever. So, I'd come  in and I'd confiscate the meat and I'd, we'd bury it. We  

didn't throw it into the kitchen. And I'd put the butchers into the brig. And during the day 

I'd visit them and I remember one of them saying, "Herr Cohen, you don't understand us 

butchers. For us blood means nothing. The cows are yours." I'd say to the police, "Give 

them an extra day." I didn™t turn them over to the Army, I didn't turn them over to the 

German police. 
 

Q: How did you feel, though, about taking food 
away which you, yourself, just said was 
needed? 
 

A: I felt awful. I was, but, but, I want to tell you something, Katie, as I read these various 
me mos and records, and having been in, in governme nt for the years Œ I was, nine years 

in Mayor Wagner's
25
 cabinet Œ governance is constantly involving you in dilemmas and 
difficult choices. Impossible choices, hair-raising choices. And it's happening all the 

time. And if you can't  ma ke choices, you got to get out of there. You know, this 

antigovernme nt stuff, for me , is in some  ways, a lot of nonsense. 
 

03:21:04 

 
Because a democratic society has to have a system where, without killing, you make 

choices. And, so, in a DP camp, the director has to ma ke difficult, impossible choices. 

And, so, but, I don't want to get to this too soon in the interview, but, on something like 

April 12th of that year, a week before Pesach, I went to the Munich railroad station and I 

sent off a couple of cables to the Œ to friends in the States. I sent one cable to Dick 

Wi nslow in the State Department and another cable to William Wurster a prominent 

architect at that time, in Cambridge. And I tell them about the food situation. The 

impossibility of it Œ no fresh food for Pesach Œ we got a little bit from the Joint. And the 

end, the end of my sentence is, "stir up the bees." And I get replies from both of them. 

But, I hadn't given it a thought at the time, but it's clear to me in Œ then and in retrospect, 

that Army Intelligence picked up the cables. And I'll come back to that later. Just on a 

personal note, during the period we were wit
hout water, when the pipe had burst, which

was exhausting period for me , I came back to my office one day to take care of some  
ma tters, and a few mi nutes later, my English secretary, Rose Hafkin, come s in, she says, 

"Henry, there's a woma n outside who says she thinks she's your cousin." And I say, 

"Well, have her wait few mi nutes, I've got to take care of this or that," and then a few 

mi nutes later I call her in. And now I'm suspicious, I don't know if she's my cousin or not. 

It would be advantageous to her if she is my cousin. So, I start interrogating her. 

Anyway, I don't know whether she found out about me  through the grapevine, because 

people are always asking, "Where did your parents come from? "  and then when they hear 

some one come s from that town, well, "Oh, the director at Camp Föhrenwald, his mother 

come s from there, his father come s from there." 
 

03:24:00 

 
We ll, whether there had been some  correspondence between her and family in New 

York, I don't know. She's my cousin. And, she come s from the Sheftel branch of the 

family tree, my mother™s, the butcher side of the family, not the baker side. It turns out 

she has a brother in the camp to whom she doesn't  talk, he's a butcher. He's probably one 

of my black marketers. I don't know at the time whether he's the one who made the threat. 

It's a small world. But, anyway, she has a sister in this camp that both of them are living 

in, just north of Munich and the sister
 has a young daughter, I don't know, seven, eight, 
nine, 10. And, I ask her, "How did you survive? " We ll, what happened was, the Germans 

had occupied the town Ivye, and at a certain point they told Œ word spread, everybody 

had to come out to the village square with their pots and pans, the Germans needed the 

metal. My cousin, this cousin, didn't wait for that, she escaped into the woods and lived 

the rest of the war with the partisans. And her older sister must have left sometime earlier 

and gone into Siberia with her little girl and spent the war in Siberia. And, so it was a 

very moving experience. And, she has since, they mi grated ma ny years ago to Canada, 

Toronto, and became very wealthy. Now, another thing involving the black ma rket, the 

so called black marketŒ 
 

Q: The people who went to the town square, were they deported?  

 

A: No, they were shot, I'm sorry, they were shot. I'm very sorry. Very few survivors from 
Ivye. 
 

Q: Your mother™s town?  

 

A: Yeah. 

 

Q: And the, how about the brother that she didn't speak with?  How had he survived?  

 

A: I don't recall. There was other family of theirs in South Africa, Rhodesia. Other brothers. 

 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0362

Q: So, here you were, the director of the Displaced Person's camp, you™re dealing with 
everything, fought in a war, you have family here. 
 
A: No. At the end of the interview, I'll give you another find. 

 

Q: Okay 

 

A: That's not in any of the ma terial that you've read.

A: Well, her name was Malka and the second names mean nothing because Œ her sister had 
an assume d name , Bashke Œ they were both Sheftels. Now, Malka, some where in this 

process, maybe in the woods or in battle with the partisans or whatever, lost the love of 

her life at the time, Bashke obviously, lost her husband. And Œ but, but it's hard to recall 

now. Malka was probably born after my mother
 left, and Bashke was probably born after 
my mother left Ivye, so there was no contact on that score. By the time they would have 

had any consciousness in terms, by virtue of age, they would probably not even have had 

any memory about my mother™s mother, no longer lived in Ivye. She went, they took her 

to some town, I don't remember. So, there was a little talk about the family, but I don't 

really remember much of that. That is Œ the critical thing was, they were family, they 

were survivors, they had been through hell, and I didn't really find out too much about 

their day to day lives. 
 

04:03:15 

 
I have the impression about the older sister in Siberia. She'd be groveling in the soil, 

planting, picking, whatever. I guess that in those days, I, I, well, let me put it this way, 

what I realize now in my dotage, is that for every one who died and for every one who 

survived, there would really be 10 or 20 stories. So, in a certain sense there are 100 to 

200,000,00 stories. And we know only a few of them. And that was not an age for me  

when I was collecting stories and, and, in a way, it, it, it Œ the Œ it Œ my focus on what I'm 

about, puts a limit on certain of the human connections from time to time. When people 

want to be able to tell you and so on, and you're focused and you're doing one, two, three 

on the list, see?  So, I don't really remember that much about that. In any event, the 

passage of time also dims recall. 
 

Q: Wa s there ever a time when you were focused on solving a problem, perhaps a broken 
water pipe or some thing, and just somehow the fact that some one was a survivor, sort of 

caught you by surprise?  Perhaps some thing they said, or the way they looked, facial 

expressions?  
 

A: You know Œ the Œ a couple of stories some times. I don't know if you have that picture in 
your group. There are four little girls, they'r e all dressed in costumes. It's clear they've 

just been in some performance. And two of the four girls, the two little ones on the, each 

side, left and right, have faces that are so gaunt and with that smile on their face, the 

visage. The two older ones are smiling. The two little ones, here it is, you know, close to 

a year after the war, and the quietness wherever they were that was droned into them, 

hasn't  yet enabled them to blossom out. The other, I don™t know whether this answers Œ 

deals with your question, Katie, but, again, it's an encounter, a very severe encounter. We 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0362  
21 
 
had, in our camp, a Rabbi Halberstam
26
. He was called the Klausenburg Rabbi. He was a, 
from a line of hundreds of years of rabbis, and he was born to be a rabbi. I'm gonna, I'll 
come back to this in a mi nute, but I want to skip to the last week or two. I've been trying 

to find out his first name. I actually had it somewhere on a piece of paper and I can't 

locate the piece of paper. So, I, I decided I would go to the Brooklyn telephone book and 

look up Halberstam and ma ke a few phone calls and ask about the Klausenburg Rabbi. 

And what was his first name . Okay?  So I go to the Brooklyn phone book, I have a 1992 

Brooklyn phone book, it doesn't  matter. Okay?  And I see Halberstam, it's almost a 

column long. And what I see in this listing of Halberstams is how ma ny have attached to 

their name, "Rabbi." So, you know, with my statistical bent, I do a count. Forty-three 

percent of the telephone listings are people with the word rabbi in front of their names. 

That's the Halberstam lineage, okay? I use statistics to illumi nate, not lie. I mean that is 

such a powerful fact, okay?  So, anyway, we'r e back. So, now, he had lost his wife in the 

Holocaust, and ma ybe 10 children. This ma n had suffered. Deeply is not an expression 

for the suffering that must have been inside this ma n. And he was in touch with his 

confreres in New York, and they raised money. 
 

04:10:01 

 
And they piled all these supplies, canned food, dried food, kosher food, clothing, 

religious articles, books on a boat that came, arrived in Bremen. And the Army would not 

release the material to Rabbi Halberstam. And the cables must have flown between 

Bremen and Munich and New York and New York and Wa shington and political 

pressure brought on Congress people, on the St
ate Department, on the Army and finally 
after a week or two, a compromi se is reached. 
They will release his Œ that material to the 
director of the camp. So, I am once again confronted with those daily dilemma s, what do 

I do with that material?  Can I Œ considering the pressure I am under from the Army on 

the black market, simply transfer it over to Rabbi Halberstam?  So, I am summoned to his 

room. He was one of the very few people in the camp who had a room of his own. 

Some where I have it, well, I won't bother, but probably 10 by 10 would have been a lot. 

And I'm sitting across him, across the table fr om him, and he's in a Hasidic robe, big 

black beard, yarmulke hat, whatever. 
 

04:12:18 

 
Black piercing eyes. And, remember what I told you earlier, I have never set foot in a 

synagogue in my life to that point Œ nor for two or three decades later Œ and here I am 

confronting the Klausenburg Rabbi, a king Œ I'm an ordinary admi nistrative bureaucrat. 

And we exchanged perfunctory greetings. And then in effect he says, "Nu? " I say, "Nu, 

what? "  He wants to know why I don't turn the ma terial over to him. I say, "But Rabbi, if 

the Army had intended for me  to turn it over to you, they would have given it to you 

directly. But they turned it over to me which means that I can't  turn it over to you." He

says, "That's not fair." I hadn't yet learned the John Kennedy phrase which didn't come 
for 15 years later, "life is unfair." I said, "I can't . It would create so much trouble, I can't 

tell you." He says, "It belongs to me." I say, "I know it belongs to you, but I can't. I will 

distribute it among the people of the camp. You will get a good share of it, but you will 

not get all of it." He is so upset. His eyes are piercing through me. I finally say to him, 

"But, Rabbi, the other people are Jews too, they have also suffered." He basically, didn't 

give a damn. I teamed something from that, I'd not encountered that before. Here I am, an 

all inclusive Jew, what I hadn't quite recognized were the meaning of these divisions with 

unbridgeable attitudes or whatever. 
 

04:15:05 

 
The meeting broke up and I left. And I knew it wasn't  fair. I knew, to this day, I know it 

wasn't  fair. The Army shouldn't have done what it did, put me  in that position. But, again, 

I had to make a decision. I had to choose. And, and, I made that choice. I mean, I don't 

recall that subsequently there were any further rami fications from it, but it was that 

incident, you see. Constantly. Now, let me  just say, not only was the black ma rket, this 

problem. You've heard -You've about it, you hear me  about it. But, the Army was also 

greatly preoccupied with the infiltration problem. The British clearly didn't want more 

Jews in Germany. And I have, I haven't gone into that here, but I've been to the National 

Archives and for selected weeks here and there over the last, during the last five years, 

maybe in the aggregate I've spent a month or five weeks of time at the National Archives, 

trying to get some better understanding of the context. And, incidentally, you find some 

very interesting material there on that. I mean, for example, you come across cables, in 

late '45, the State Department is cabling all the ambassadors in every country in the 

world, asking on a top secret basis, "Is there any room in your Œ in the country you are 

designated to, is there any room for Jews? "  And then you see cables comi ng back Œ I 

don't think I've read all the cables comi ng back Œ but substantially, the answer is "no." 

But, what you get in that period is the sense that Harry Truman and the State Department, 

under pressure from the British with regard to Palestine, want to explore what are the 

options?  Then in other ma terial, you find the secret me moranda flowing out of the 

Eastern countries, Poland, Sweden, Copenhagen, 
relating to the Zionist plot to move 

people into the U.S. zone of Germany. 
 

04:18:51 

 
And. some  rabbi whose been to Poland, meets with the American Ambassador in 

Stockholm and he's telling him about what he found. Anyway, you come  across all this 

stuff. And some  of it is suggestive of a conspiracy. I've been exploring this in order to 

understand what I was in the mi ddle of, you see?  Finally, I don't remember the date now, 

there's a long me morandum, there are two I think, me morandum from Robert Murphy, 

whose the chief political officer at the office of military governme nt, he was Ike's
27
 chief 
                                                          
27
 Dwight D. Eisenhower 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0362  
23 
 
political officer in Tunisia, North Africa, and he's basically saying, "You're not dealing 
basically with a conspiracy. You're dealing Œ what you™re dealing with is the fact that the 

Jews don't want to live in a country that was a cemetery to their people, their relatives. 

They are fearful of the Poles because when they go back to claim property, there are 

killings. They know that the country is going Communist, they don't want to live under a 

Communist government. It's in this atmosphere Œ to get out of this that the Zionists are 

enabling. It's not a conspiracy, okay? " So, that's at the highest level of military 

government. You come in at the field level, the second most important issue for this for 

the battalion leaders, is the infiltration. 
 

04:21:00 

 
So, they start passing rules that we can't  give out food cards to people who haven't had 

prior food cards. We can't  give out identity cards to people who haven't had prior identity 

cards. How do you think we feel if, if in a team, you all have to be Jewish if you're in this 

team, you're there for social humanitarian purposes. How do you feel being told you can't  

give out these cards to people who are infiltrating?  Okay?  Now, I should point outŒ 
 

Q: How do you feel?  

 

A: You feel awful. And rebellious. And you're gonna bootleg cards some how. And, and, I 
should tell you this anecdote. Nevertheless, under all of this pressure, twice a month, at 

mi dnight, you can ask Œ start asking, "When did I get some sleep? "  I would go to the 

camp, pick up a few cops, ma ybe this time I've had a staff or two with me , and we would 

start going into every building and every room and taking a count of who is there Œ name , 

and who is there. We  were doing a mi dnight check and let's say, we found 2,500 people 

in the camp. The next morning, word would spread that there was a mi dnight check. A 

thousand or more people from all over Germany would suddenly descend on you. They 

were in Munich to see a relative. They were in Munich to check on their papers. They 

were here because of that, they were Œ you don't know which of them are telling the truth 

and who, and who is lying. So, some  end up with duplicate cards. Okay?  You're ma king 

difficult decisions, right?  
 

Q: So, you're trying to control who's in the camp, but what you're saying said, people are 
comi ng in, ma ybe eight months after the war has ended, and the U.S. Army doesn't  want 

them to, or UNRRA doesn't  want them toŒ 
 

04:23:44 

 

A: No, no. I'm making two Œ I'm really talking about two categories. I'm talking about the 
people who are already in Germany and who are, who are exploiting the system by 

getting duplicate cards so they can pick up the food here and there and move it on the 

black market and get a little cash. Okay? And the other is the fr esh arrivals. Okay? And 

the Army is against the fresh arrivals. They don't like the duplicate cards, either, but they 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0362  
24 
 
don't want any more. Because no matter what Robert Murphy at the top level says Œ 
remember the top leadership is smarter, they'r e more politically connected to what's 

going on in the States, so they Œ their attitude to Eisenhower and McCloy and so it's 

different at the ground. Well, let me just state something else, Katie. You're too young Œ 

You have to understand that in the 1930s Œ I didn™t experience the 1920s, I was a child Œ 

but in 1930s and '40s there was a lot of antisemitism in the United States. A lot of 

ordinary citizens had anti-Jewish feelings. They'r e your troops. It's reflected Œ if you ask 

doctors who are, let's say, 75 years old and over, "What was it like getting into medical 

school in the 1930s? "  You'll hear stories. My brother Œ I spoke to a fellow up on the 

vineyard who's a professor emeritus of physiology at Johns Hopkins, he graduated as an 

undergraduate in the '30s, first in his class at Johns Hopkins, was not admitted to the 

medical school. Went to the University of Maryland medical school and then sometime 

in the '50s, I guess, became the first Jewish professor at Johns Œ of medicine at Johns 

Hopkins. There was antisemitism, this is the Œ people don't speak about it now. I mean, it 

wasn't  violent, it wasn't  virulent like in Europe and certain various places, Germany, 

certainly Poland. But, there was lots. So when you Œ when, at the ground floor level they, 

the infiltration, the infiltrees, are an inconvenience. It upsets the system. They want 

discipline Œ order, that's all an occupation force understands. I, I, I, I came across a letter 

someone in 1948 was asking me would I be willing to lecture at some military training 

program in the States as part of an effort to enrich an understanding of this. So, you come  

into here, and it's, it's, it's tailor made for a clash. Okay? ItŒ 
 

Q: What did you want though?  As you're runni
ng the camp, but you're also, you're Jewish, 
and as you said, you understand that these fresh arrivals could be fleeing persecution in a 

place like Poland. So, what do you want?  
 

A: Well, I want more camps. I mean it's no, no big deal. Okay?  Let me, I want to address 
this. In Germany, at approximately the time I was there, there were a few, there were 

between 90 and 100,000 displaced persons, Jewish displaced persons. Of these, about 

65,000 lived in camps and 25,000 lived outside of camps. In June of '46, which is 

towards the end of my stay, with the Army now for months ranting and raving about the 

infiltrees, don't give any Œ incidentally, I wasn
't  the only camp director or staff protesting 
these things. The, the UNRRA people in other places were also, we used to get together 

and organize group protests against some of this Œ but, in the mi ddle of June, there's a 

pogrom in Poland, in Kielce Œ 40 Jews are killed. I think in the next year, after I left, 

another 100,000 came. These are meaningless figures when you talking, when you're 

talking 6,000,000 dead, and 100,000 in Germany. Equivalent to one and a half percent. 

And if you have another 100,000, it's two-thirds of one percent, I think, if I'm doing the, 

no, it's two, two over 60, yeah, it's, no, it's two and a half percent. I mean Œ the proportion 

between what's happened here and the number of survivors, the ratios, ma kes the Œ you 

should want more survivors rather than less. And the political system worldwide has to 

adjust to that reality. And here we are, a year after the end of the war, and these people 

are still homeless, without fresh food, I have in one of my me mos an indication of some  

officer in some  group situation, in a court or some thing, suddenly arrests a Jew who's 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0362  
25 
 
there. And he later says he wanted to show the Germans that he was disciplining 
some one. 
 

04:30:34 

 

Q: We  need to change tapes. 

 

End of Tape #4 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0362  
26 
 
Tape #5 
 
05:01:05 

 

A: Okay, I can't  find that particular, maybe on the next break, I'll, I'll find it. Yeah. 

 

Q: What we were just talking about, obviousl
y, there's frustration in your voice about the 
situation and I did read some other journalistic reports commenting that people a year 

after the end of the war, a year after liberation, that people were living in very cramped 

quarters, that had echoes of concentration camps Œ obviously they were worse. Could you 

just talk a little more about that frustration. What would you have liked to have seen 

happening that you could not provide?  
 

A: We ll, you see, given the camp itself, which did not have individual kitchens Œ though 
gradually, people got cookers and things like that Œ I would have wanted them to move 

into the German market and get fresh food a year after the end, the war™s ended. What are 

we getting GI issue for?  I would have preferred that they keep looking for more housing 

facilities. So, in a room, in the large room, of the houses, of the houses, which could be 

the equivalent of about 350 square feet, which is smaller than 20 by 20, we could have as 

many as 15 to 20 people living. Four or five families in double-decker cots. Families 

separating themselves fr om other families by hanging blankets fr om the ceiling Œ 

including some  single individuals living in the mi ddle of family Œ and people, and so on, 

and children and so on. They should have gotten more housing. Reduced the population 

of the camp to, to 2,000 from 4,000, let's say. And the food was a problem. But they, 

basically, sometimes in a memo here and there you'll see, there are understandable 

humanitarian reasons, but then they go on to forget that they uttered that word. And it's a 

completely, it was a completely different outlook. 
 

05:04:24 

 
You see, you also have to remember, Katie, that the GI™s were fraternizing with German 

girls and German wome n Œ widespread, extensive. The German types were more 

gemütlich
28
 to them than the Jewish survivor girls and wome n, who were Eastern 
European. So, during the day you're out in the field and at night you're with a German 

Fräulein
29
. I can't  tell you whether it's 100 percent of the soldiers or 99 percent that so 
engaged. But, and the officers, I mean, when I was running Œ when I was in military 

government, organizing and running that venereal  disease hospital, a couple of officers 

from some nearby battalion, got in touch with my captain asking him to release a certain 

woma n who was their girlfriend, or one of their girlfriends, I don't reme mber. And I had 

to stand up to this at the time, to the captain, he Œ turns out he was a really wonderful 

guy, a lawyer from Florida and say, "We can't  do it. She's got to stay inside the hospital." 

But, here these schmucks are bringing pressure on us to release a woman with venereal 
                                                          
28

29

disease because she's one of their girlfriends. So, this was very extensive. And, I guess, 
the way in which I've developed temperamentally over the years, because I was a, a, what 

do you call it, a fast achiever, a young achiever, is fundamentally, I don™t suffer fools 

easily or kindly. I, I have too much experience in extremely difficult situations. I know, I 

have confidence in my own sense of fairness and my own sense of integrity that, as 

anyone who has worked with me  over the years knows, some  of these truths about me , 

and I know them. 
 

05:07:22 

 
And so, when I get this kind of stuff Œ as my own confidence builds Œ I get more and 

more indignant. Maybe I was too young to be politic about some  of my reactions, though, 

I don't think it was too much. There was one incidence described in the charges against 

me that I Œ that this officer says to me, something that they can™t do better on housing for 

the DP™s than they do for the GI™s. And his Œ and I did this Œ the, the charges in front of a 

few enlisted men Œ and the claim is that I said to him, "Fuck the GI™s, I'm only worried 

about the DP™s" Now, later I go and I rendezvous with this officer, and I discuss the 

situation with him. And he denies that there were any enlisted men in the vicinity, in our 

vicinity when we had that conversation. And he also agrees that the essence of our 

conversation was that the GI™s are young men, they'r e trained to live under very difficult 

and trying conditions, so it won't be terrible, it wouldn't be terrible if you didn't have 

quite appropriate housing for them. But, here you're dealing with survivors from 

concentration camps that have suffered so, who aren't  trained for this kind of thing, who 

are families, children, wives. You can™t ma ke a comparison between what you do for the 

GI™s and what you do for the DP™s. So, in effect, that conversation gets turned around as 

a charge of my being uncooperative, using disrespectful language, etc. 
 

Q: I want to go back, just before we move into that and ask you: You were beginning to 
describe an atmosphere among a lot of the GI™s that they essentially sympathized, I think 

this is what you were saying, more with the German people in a way, than they did with 

the people you were working with, displaced persons, the raggedy looking person comi ng 

from Poland. 
 

05:10:10 

 

A: Katie, in the Œ in some of the material you have, I have, I have, I have inserted certain 
quotations from official documents that I have found in the Holo Œ in the National 

Archives. Which is critical of the Jewish DP™s. "They flaunt themselves in front of the 

German police who they know can™t do anything about them. And they do various things 

which will incur the wrath of the German population and which will encourage them to 

feel that Hitler after all was right." Now, that's an American offi cer writing that sentence 

in 1946. 
 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0362  
28 
 
Q: Do you reme mber hearing things that, or f
eeling that tone, or witnessing something like 
that? 
 
A: I, I, well... 

 

Q: Do you remember hearing things like that, or  feeling that tone, or witnessing some thing 
like that? 
 

A: Well, I'm not sure that I heard those words, but I'm sure I heard things like it, and I've 
witnessed various.... Look, look at the other thing that Œ another, another Œ we haven't 

covered the famous riot. Well, I should precede this Œ though I'll come back to it Œ with a 

little bit of an outline, just so it's put into time context. I send the cable to the U.S. on the 

food situation, "stir up the bees," April 12th. Within one week to the day after that, the 

battalion commander arrives for a five day intensive inspection. There has never been a 

five day intensive inspection. They come  for a few hours here, here they drop in, send 

some one else. Five days of inspection. That's undertaken on the 19th of April. And, let's 

say it. goes 'til the 24th of April. From my memorandum, I can see, tell, that there's a very 

active period from about May the ninth to May the 14th in which the Army is asking for 

my head. With all these different charges on Zionism and so on and so forth. 
 

05:13:03 

 
I should add, unrelated to me and unrelated
 to Föhrenwald, on about May the ninth, 

there's riot in the camp at Landsberg. There's also a riot in another place, I think, 

Starnberg or some thing. Then on the evening of May 22nd, it's a Friday night, most Œ I 

and most of my team at our billets in Wolfratshausen the weekend is beginning. And, 

after dinner we start getting messages on the phone, there's trouble here, there's trouble 

this, someone is reported hurt at the German movie theater in Wolfratshausen. We send 

someone out to look at it, no trouble at the movie theater at Wolfratshausen. Then, at 

some  point, I see some body in the car area of the house, gesticulating and so on. And, he 

says there's trouble here, there's trouble there, I don't quite know what it all is, but what I 

do at that juncture Œ is I instruct two of our staff to stay at the billets in case there are 

anymore phone calls Œ I take two people with me. I'm going to the German police station 

to find out what's going on. I send the rest of the staff to the camp to see what's going on 

there. OK?  And here is what we discovered Œ and I'll tell you what this is, what this brief 

summa ry is based on Œ the following morning I instructed every staff me mber, let's say 

20, 22, to prepare for me  a chronological report of the night before, where they were a 

certain hour, give me a half hour later, half hour later, and tell me what was going on. 

Wherever they were. So I have a series of these memos which give me a panoramic view 

of the situation. And here is what happened Œ the sense of what happened. The essence of 

what happened. It's a Friday night, a coupl
e of drunken American soldiers are going up 
the stairs of a building in the German village. They'r e going to the third fl oor where 

they've got a couple of girlfriends. On the second floor is a Jewish family that's living 

outside of the camp. They have some  friends who are visiting them from the camp, there 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0362  
29 
 
ma y have been four or five people there, I don't know, reme mber. The American soldiers 
stop off at the second floor. And they start coercing the people, they move around with 

their knives or bayonets. They have their guns out. They'r e telling one guy to play his 

harmonica. They'r e asking, "Are you Jewish?  Are you Jewish?  I don't like Jews," he says, 

and he rams one guy in the chin with the butt of a gun. Hits another guy in the head. One 

or two of these people got out of the apartment and got back to the camp. There are some 

1,000 or more people in the camp theater watching a movie in the blackness, in the 

darkness. And one of them runs into the back of the theater, into the darkness, and he 

starts yelling, ﬁA shchita!
30
ﬂ ﬁslaughterﬂ Œ this is the classic phrase Œ ﬁMe harget yiddin 
in Wolfratshausen!
31
" slaughter, they'r e killing Jews in Wolfratshausen." And the group 
gets up. Now, then other rumors start. As people are moving towards the exit, that a Jew 

was seen kidnapped by Germans in a truck travelling south. So, people commandeer 

trucks and they start chasing something. They start stopping vehicles, passing and taking 

Germans out and beating them up. Some start moving north. I go to the German police 

station and I meet an Army officer there, and I tell him, we start piecing it together. I tell 

him, "Look, you put your soldiers a mile or three-quarters of a mile north of the camp. 

Give me a chance to contain whatever is going on." And, at that point, I get back to the 

camp, and by that point, my staff and the DP, the DP police are, have a cordon and are 

getting them back. And then we have a mi dnight curfew, everybody off the streets. The 

official report on this incident, which I find in the National Archives, I didn™t know that 

this existed at that time, describes the riot and indicates that there is evidence to indicate 

that this riot was generated by, or in behalf
 of, Mr. Cohen the camp director. And there is 

no reference in his report to the American soldiers. Okay?  So, what am I supposed to do?  

Passive, "bleh, bleh." But, but, this riot, you see, follows by 12 to 15 days, the Army 

effort to get rid of me . So, when the riot occurs, this officer who's writing the report, is 

linking it to the Army strategy to get rid of this uncooperative son-of-a-bitch, Henry 

Cohen. Now, from my point of view, the riot
 and the story, you know, some  of it, beating 
up the innocent Germans. I cry inside, but for me it's a symptom of how close to the edge 

the pain still is, a year after liberation. Remember, May 22nd, the war ended May eighth 

a year earlier. For me it's a sign of how close to the edge. The riot in Landsberg, the riot 

here, the riot there. Our people are suffering. Look where they'r e living, look what they'r e 

eating. Look how they'r e being treated. And they'r e living among Germans. 
 

05:21:02 

 
And the Army, at that level, has absolutely no grasp, no empathy, no understanding of 

this. It's, it's, it's unbelievable, I can't , I indicated in that memo, here we are 50 years later, 

and I can't  comprehend of that Army attitude. I can't  comprehend it. I mean, I, I, I'm a 

soldier, I understand law and order, I understand discipline, I understand all those things. 

But, for such stupid, biased, inadequate people to be running the occupation. One worries 

about, one has to worry about a lot of other things that happen under their tutelage. See, 

it's not my combat experience where I question Army orders or anything, I feel proud to

have been a combat soldier. Fifty years later I am proud that I was able to do that, that I 
fought in the war. What makes me sink into the ground is the American soldier at peace. 

And lacking, it's, it's quite possible it's different in today's Army than it was then, I don't 

know enough about what Œ how they handle Haiti or Soma lia, not Soma lia, at Soma lia 

wasn't  that great. There's no seykhel
32
, intelligence, subtlety at work, you see. You see, in 
some  of the stuff you've read where Margaret Gerber is talking about my personal 

qualities, one of the things that she's saying is that the DP's trust him even when he comes 

down on them, they know what's at his soul level. And they will take it when he's harsh 

with them. And these guys don't have it at the soul level. 
 

Q: So many questions. Let me ask, we'r e talking about a year after liberation, and, and 
certainly memories often surface around anniversaries. I wonder what kind of airing did 

those emotions ever get?  Any kind of formal way?  Was there counseling?  Were there 

some  kind of communal sessions where people were able to pray about the end of the 

war?  What did go on in terms of letting people get some of this out?  
 

A: We ll, I don™t Œ yeah, I don't know to what extent, we had a lot of social workers on the 
staff. And, so, I don't know to what extent. You know, now we ma ke much more to do 

about group therapy and group process and all of that. 
 

05:29:30 

 
But, but, I don't have any easy visualization of it, Katie. I keep struggling with my 

writing class as I did in certain respects with Lustig
33
 or with you, you'll see that, the 
writing part is what I'm saying. I want more than the facts, Ma™am, and I stay with the 

facts. You see, where I can't  tell you anything from me mory, I won't, I won't speak on it. 

I can only speak on that which I can draw. If I don't reme mber, then I can only speak on 

that which I can draw from my quote, unquote, "factual materials". And I, I, I frustrate 

people like you no end. 
 

Q: I'm not frustrated. Actually, you've intrigued 
and tantalized, that's all. One story I'd like 
you to tell us, and perhaps it actually in some way, does answer my question for one 

person, is the story of the young girl who insisted on singing to a group of your visitors. I 

wonder if you could tell usŒ 
 

A: Well, one of the therapeutic things that was happening all the time were visitors. Rabbi 
Herzog
34
, the chief rabbi of Palestine. Wr iters, singers, the Anglo-American Commi ssion, 
they come  and they spend a day and they'r e giving people some  hope that maybe they can 

have an impact on some thing. If LaGuardia
35
 sends Ira A. Hirschma nn as an emissary to 
look over things, people get hope from that. So there was a lot, a constant stream of

visitors. On this particular occasion, we were visited by H. Leivik
36
, a writer-poet, and 
Emma  Schaver
37
 who is a singer from Detroit. 
 
05:27:10 

 
And we put on a concert, a program for a couple of evenings, and that also is lovely. 

Anyway, following the Œ at the end of the visit, the morning that they were leaving, 

Leivik and Schaver are having breakfast and a young girl come s in. And she walks over 

to their table and she says, "I want to sing to you." And Leivik says, "What do you mean 

sing?  Do you write songs? "  And she says, "No, I sing." He says, "You know we are in a 

hurry, we are doing another camp." She says, "Well, you'll come a little later." And 

Leivik says to her, ﬁWho are you, where are you from?  Are you alone?  Is anyone here 

with you? " She gave up on him, she goes against the wall, and she introduces the song 

she's going to sing, the Shavler, the song of the Shavler ghetto. And it's a song about a 

mother who has to give her child away in order to save the child. It's a very sad song. 

And then she sings other songs. And then she's asked Œ then they do ask her some  

questions about herself, and she says where she's from, she lost her whole family, she's 

all alone, she's now 15, 16, she's been to 17 concentration camps, when she was released 

she went to a city, she developed typhus fever there and she gradually worked her way 

west to camp Föhrenwald, and then she sings some  more. And Leivik danced, Schaver Œ 

you know, and this is one of the experiences of their lives. For them to unanticipatedly 

come  across this. Then they come  in Œ they'r e leaving Œ they come  into my office, there 

are two wome n sitting in front of my desk complaining about the food, and I say to them, 

"Look, I'm trying whatever I can do to make it better," and they say good-bye. Leivik, in 

leaving, says to Emma Schaver, "He's telling them he's trying to make it better, but he 

probably doesn't  believe that himself, that he'll be able to."

Q: The young girl who sang to the visitors, tell us little bit more about her song she sang. 
Did you ever hear her sing it afterwards?  
 

A: I don't remember. 

 

Q: Did you ever meet her?  

 

A: I don't remember. Probably did, but I don't really remember. The Œ [interviewee reads 
from notes] "it's the song of a Jewish, the pain of a Jewish child whose mother has to give 

her away to non-Jews in order to save her from the fire. The song is full of endless pain." 

And the Œ let me  Œ on a side thing just, you know, sort of an interesting difference in 

perspective, while I take in things largely macro with incidents satisfying my macro I 

don't focus on macro, mi cra. I focus on macra Œ the task at hand, one way or another. 

And, what was I comi ng to?  It slips me . I wanted to say some thing to you about that.... 

Oh, yes! When I was leaving the camp, I let word out that if anybody wanted to write 

letters to relatives in the United States, I would take them with me and I would stamp 

them in New York. So, I had, I came back with hundreds of letters and ma ny of them 

were not sealed, so I took the liberty of reading some of these letters. Not a single letter, 

that I read, was talking about me or camp admi nistration. 
 

06:04:30 

 
Every letter was mi cro; what was happening to me , family, who™s this, that, so on. 

Completely different perspective. So, I recognized all these years that often, what I may 

do, what I think is for the public good, the people for whose good it is are oblivious to 

what I am doing. They live in their own little worlds. In my career as a university dean 

and students, the same thing applies. The students are in their little thing. They'r e not 

concerned with the dean, if they happen to be some where where the dean shows up, they 

get up and they'll shake hands with him. Or if I phone some body and he knows it's me , its 

a respectful response, but basically, those are different worlds. And I'm aware of that. 
 

Q: Tell us what it was like on your level, on the macro level, on a day-to-day basis. What 
would happen in that camp?  When would you get to work?  What was the rhythm about 

that camp which sounds like it was some sort of small town?  
 

A: Yeah. Well, for one thing, one of the things in the memos that I get, is, and the district 
director refers to this at considerable length, how we were probably the most visited 

Jewish DP camp in the zone. He was using that as an argument to tell the military about 

how much distraction I had to cope with from task. But we were getting, we were getting 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0362  
33 
 
visitors Œ I don™t know if every day, I can't  remember, I have no calendars from that 
period of time, but an awful, a tremendous flow of people comi ng in and out. 
 

06:07:11 

 
Military, one sort or another, the medical offi cer of the battalion going to visit the 

hospital, or this guy comi ng. Jewish leaders comi ng; rabbi, other rabbis comi ng, so, a lot 

of the pictures of that Œ I should say this, a lot of the pictures that you see at the 

Holocaust Museum and the ones that I have, are not really pictures of every day life or, 

and/or suffering, they are largely celebratory pictures; the Macabbi
38
 games, the theatre 
performances, the visit of the General, the visit of Rabbi Herzog, that is, they'r e, they are 

the pictures are not really a representation of daily life in the camp. But, basically, I don't 

know what time I got there, you know, eight-thi
rty or nine o'clock, presumably, we had 

breakfast at our billet. Could have been one or another staff meeting, meeting with 

different people, you know, you're supervising 20 people, you have the hospital, you're 

having group meetings, you're going out to look at  this or that. Occasionally, you have to 

go to Munich to check in or to district headquarters. I used to on occasion, visit the house 

where the district staff lived and have dinner there. It was an easy way, or an easy 

evening to compare notes on one thing or another. Also, there's a constant flow of 

admi nistrative directives that are comi ng in. Food, clothing, transportation. There's a lot 

of bread and butter stuff that goes on. And, incidentally, there are times when, among 

visitors of the camp, I have pictures from Catholic charities comi ng with supplies and 

food. So, they were also helping out. And then there are celebratory events. Pesach
39
 
comes, you have to organize a Seder and there's a flag raising ceremony at 

Hochlandslager, and who should be invited and meetings with the camp committee, in 

groups or individually, the chairman of the camp committee who, incidentally, was a 

wonderful ma n. I used to always see him when I went to Israel. He passed away 

prematurely. He was, he became a high school principal in Israel. And I still see, 

incidentally, the two surviving me mbers of the Jewish Agency staff in Israel when I go. 

And they'r e now in their 80s. And there's Amram who lives in New York, he's in the 

travel business. 
 

Q: His name  is?  

 

A: Huh?  

 

Q: His name  is?  

 

A: Amram Zur, Z-U-R andŒ 

 

Q: Can you tell us aboutŒ

A: Let me , I want to tell you just as a by, some thing happened a year, two years?  Two years 
ago. The two survivors in Israel, Zviah Lahar, who is a nurse, and she became the chief 
of nursing for the Œ one of the ma jor kibbutz moveme nts. She's now retired. And she lost 

her first husband in the Jewish Brigade during the war. And then she married a man, I 

forget his first name, Lahar and they live in Kibbutz Givat Brenner in Israel. And the 

other person is Liowa Lak who is really the chief of the team and a very wonderful ma n. 
 

06:12:27 

 
And he, along the way, worked with Goldie, Golda Meir when she was in Russia and he 

was helping develop contacts with the surviving Jewish community in Russia. Then he 

worked with some  agricultural technical agency and so on. Two years ago, following the 

Hebron Massacre, there's a message on my telephone from Zviah, I get back to her, and 

Zviah is in tears about what happened. And she's calling me  incoherently, "Henry, come  

help." I mean, there was no logic to it. But it says something about our relationship. 

ﬁCome help, help." That says was that some thing about the sense of suffering she was 

experiencing as a result of that massacre. And these are people who were lost in the war 

and on. And, you know, you experience what we Œ i.e. what Israel is now Lebanon Œ and 

most of the world does not understand the complexity of that are at work here, in terms of 

Œ but I also, while I'm on that, let me before we were on camera, about Lustig saying to 

me , in an interview 15 years ago, ﬁYou know, Jews live in a camp. They go from 

concentration camp or a, a camp in Germany, and then en route to Palestine, the British 

get them into camps in Cyprus. From camp to camp to camp." And I was thinking about 

it last discussion I heard about the choices between Peres
40
 and Netanyahu
41
 Œ Likud
42
 
Labor
43
 Œ that if the Israelis elect Peres, they will be electing a leader who because they, 
if they agree with him, will work to remove the walls of the camp Israel. 
 

06:15:22 

 
And if they elect Netanyahu, they will elect aleader who builds the walls of the camp. So 

we are still struggling with the camp metaphor, from camp to camp to camp. And I. think 

you know where my feelings are. But, I've got to be non-political, 'cause I'm not a 

me mber of any Zionist organization. 
 

Q: What was your feeling when you were ma naging that camp?  Did you have liked it to 
essentially disappear as you managed it?  Or did you see it as a kind of, still a very 

necessary refuge?  Even though it had all these problems?  
 

A: Yeah. We ll, of course, simply put, for me , the solution was that, hopefully, there would 
be developed a state in Israel. I didn't know by what name. That all the refugees and DP™s

would go there and the camps would dissolve. I, you know, I saw some  going to 
America, some  going to Australia, where there were relatives, and so on and so forth. 

But, to me , the bulk would be going to Israel. There was a poll taken in the Spring of 

1946 by the Anglo-American Committee
44
, this is fr om their report, they Œ I think this is 
part of the poll, [interviewee reads from notes] "In our camp the vote for going to Israel 

was about 90 percent or more. Zone-wide, 70 percent wished to go to Palestine." So, that 

was the overwhelming desire at that time. I should add that Föhrenwald was actually the 

last camp closed in Germany in about 1954. At some point in the process, I didn't keep up 

with it, UNRRA went out of business, was taken over by the International Refugee 

Organization. 
 

06:18:11 

 
But, then it was turned over to the American Joint Distribution Committee and as they 

closed other centers, they brought surplus into Föhrenwald. And then it was closed, 

finally, in some thing like 1954. 
 

Q: Did you ever get the sense that people got attached to it, even with its problems, because, 
after all, it was a sort of safe haven?  It was home?  
 

A: I don't, no, I never, never got that feeling. I think people felt some element of safety there 
because on UNRRA, because of the Jewish Agency. There were also occasionally people 

around from the Jewish Brigade Œ which is a separate, I don't have much on it, because I 

didn't know much about it Œ but, remember, they were being organized in kibbutzim, 

there was Hochlandslager, so there were, there were organizational structures that were 

providing some protection for people there that Œ and to that extent, it probably had a 

wholesome effect. I mean, if, you've seen the picture from the Maccabi game s, have you?  

I mean, God, this is a year after the war, and you see these young people doing these 

acrobatics and exercises, it's nothing short of amazing. Well that's morale building 

activity. 
 

Q: What was your sense of what was going on within the people in the camp?  We re they 
recreating their lives in their previous homes and villages? Or were they creating some 

new type of life that they hoped would be thei
r life in the future and in a future state?  
 

A: I think that Föhrenwald was a completely interim matter. I know this from my own 
relatives. I know this from other people whom I've known. They came to Israel, they 

became part of that country and either went to kibbutzims, stayed in Tel Aviv, went to 

Jerusalem. If they were religious, they went to Bené Beraq you know?  They were like 

immi grants in any country, there was a period of adaptation and absorption. And 

Föhrenwald is a passing experience, about which they ma y have some  benign

remembrance or not. Like this young woman, it, for some reason it Œ in her life it figures 
very importantly. 
 

06:21:26 

 

Q: The young woma n you've been writing to? 

 

A: On the computer, yeah. The ma n who's in Los Angeles, I've had one or two exchanges 
with him, but he hasn't  felt the need to go further, so, you know, it's a very variable thing. 

I should also say that I and others who returned were writing articles about this 

experience for three or four years after we
 returned. And giving speeches at different 
Jewish, or other, organizations, so we were  sharing our experiences then in different 

ways. What™s, what I find interesting now from a few friends, and I don't know to what 

extent it's reflective, but a few friend whom Œ to whom I've sent the speech I gave a year 

ago in Great Neck, have written me saying they've shared it with their children. That is, 

people in my age group have a strong need to share these experiences with our children. 

So, they used my experience which is reflective of their life to a certain extent, to share it 

with the children. 
 

Q: Have you shared this with your children?  

 

A: Yes, yes, yes. And, I haven't had much feedback from them. They, they haven't 
verbalized feedback. 
 

Q: Tell us about the first Seder at the camp when you were in charge. It mi ght have been the 
first Seder after liberation. 
 

A: Oh,yes. 

 

Q: Would you tell us about that Œ what did it look like?  

 

A: Well, we had, I don't remember the dining room area, but we had long tables all decked 
out. I don't remember who led the service. I have pictures of me with different people 

there, including me mbers of the team; Chaim Hoffman, who was the head of the Jewish 

Agency in Munich, was at our Seder. And, we fed them gefilte fish as far as I can recall. 

Where we got some  of the food to feed them, I don't know, I didn't ask. And there were 

Army people there and I don't think they knew what the hell they were eating, so they 

probably thought it was GI food also. That is, a piece of gefilte fish to them was like a 

can of K-rations. 
 

06:24:22 

 
They'd never had it before, it was from some  other can. Maybe they were even happy to 

have never have had it before. But it was a very buoyant, very friendly, very lively 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0362  
37 
 
occasion. And I don't reme mber who had the afikomen, I don't know who stole it or 
found it, I don't reme mber any of that. But, we, you know, I see pictures which show 

these group dinners, different celebratory dinners. And though, that is, our commitment 

was to do positive things to raise morale. And we did a lot of it. You know, I don't like 

these traumatic stories Œ to, to bury, the fact is we had hundreds of children in schools 

and teachers teaching children. We had a Yeshiva. Oh, and I came across an article, 

where Œ of Leivik's Œ where he devotes a piece of it to going into the Yeshiva in 

Föhrenwald and it remi nds him of his childhood. So, we had that going here. So, there 

was a lot of things. 
 

Q: A question that I didn't get to ask about just day-to-day living and you were describing 
the rooms being so small and privacy. How were married couples able to be intimate?  I 

mean, how, what, do you know anything about that?  Or how did people ma ke do?  
 

A: I have deniability. No, but look, let's face it, Katie, I told you the story about my father as 
a six year old boy. His mother has died, his father is remarried, he has a stepmother who 

has two young children and he's occasionally awakened by some  noise in the mi ddle of 

the night. And in the candle light he sees this stepmother feeding her children. 
 

06:27:04 

 
Now, that's a guess to me, that he lived in very close quarters. So, he was experiencing in 

1897, sex among adults at night. So, I think that a lot of these people who came from 

shtetlach, really had that as part of their background. I, I've never talked to any of them 

about it. But, it's an interesting question and it™s an interesting issue. But, I think it was 

probably going on all the time and, not only with the children hearing it, but unrelated 

people were hearing it. For us in America, it's quite a strange kind of experience, but, 

when you live Œ what do you think Indians did in a teepee, or Italians in their little 

hovels?  I think that was the world before we began building houses with more than 1,500 

square feet. And apartments with more, with four rooms.

A: Now, give me a mi nute. Hi. This is a list from Œ of the camp that I have which lists all the 
aspects of the camp and in some, in the top group, next to each, almost every line, I have 

the staff assignments. So, [interviewee 
reads from notes] "Number one, overall, 
admi nistration. Coordination of staff, C
ohen. Personnel actions for staff, including 
voluntary agencies, Gerber and Hafkin." Hafk
in was my secretary, Gerber was assistant 
director. "Administration of DP™s in the Landkreis, " outside of the camp, "Oksny, " 

who's the Norwegian woma n. "Public relations, Cohen, Gerber, Hafkin, Robins," who 

was another assistant director. "Total space requirements for," I'll stop reading names, 

"for billeting of staff for DP™s, other accommodations; warehousing, laundry, etc. Sub-

centers; Hochlandslager," which was for the kibbutzim, "and Dorfen," I think that was 

some  kind of sanitarium. Then "police court, 
organization of street officers, registration, 
admi nistrative information, delegated to welfare, reports and statistics." Then next major 

heading, "Physical plant; equipment, water, sewage, electrical facilities, heating, 

building, equipment maintenance, road repair, radio, telephones, sign painting, etc. 

gardens." Once you read it, you realize what goes into this. Even, even I'm impressed. 

"Welfare, information and tracing, group work, recreation, cultural activities, education, 

adult, children, library, religions, newspaper and radio, vocational training, religious 

affairs, child welfare, family welfare, case work including psychological, home visiting, 

hospital welfare inch, including occupied therapy." I don't know whether that's a typo. 

"Employment, DP™s in the Landkreis, amenity supply distribution, gardens, immi gration, 

rep, supply, securing requireme nts from staff,
 uncover new sources of supply, supplies, 

report on incomi ng supplies, recreation, requisitions submitted, items surplus materials, 

suggest possible uses, wooden thing." I don't know what "Warehouse, storage of 

supplies." 
 

07:05:00 

 
"Centralization of supply storage, physical
 distribution in case of food Œ bulk only, 
determine method and timing of distribution, periodic listing of inventories, no 

responsible for Joint unless submitted to common pool, Joint Distribution Committee,

Q: Wa nt to hold until those sirens pass?  You were running a town.

A: Yeah. Incidentally, I have other handwritten notes. "Food; conditions under which 
served, no fresh food, compare to Germans. Black market; Hochlandslager cigarettes 

what roll do they play in the black market?  Engineering supplies; brushes, roof paper, 

nails, toilets." This is a little more detail than there. "Medical supplies;" I think it says 

"hormones, amenity supplies, obstetrical, requisitioning procedures, teeth." We'd have 

problems with dentists. "Sanitation supplies, housing, density, morality." You see? That 

means it went through my head. "Lack of community space, Landkreis responsibilities," 

that's the county burden, "no clear cut de
finition. Clothing; sizes, U.S. clothing. 
Employment; no incentive. Police work; extra territoriality. Abnormality requires 

intelligent rehabilitation programs. Staff billeting and moral."

"No place to go to relax. Army relations; some soldiers do not understand the almost 

inevitable and natural clash of interests and resent it. Riot, their demand for my removal, 

transportation, encourage a system of scroungi ng." [interviewee ceases reading] So there 

are these recurrent things, Katie. I, I wanted to mention something, when all of this 

trouble was developing, a number of us began to become  concerned with one of the 

me mbers of the team, a Dutch woma n. Her name  was Maria Van Bimbergen. She was 

supposedly the daughter of the chief justice of Holland before the war. She had Œ as far as 

I know, was the only one, one the team among the wome n, who had an Army officer 

friend, boyfriend fraternizing. And, as the charges kept flowing, particularly on some  of 

the more confidential issues, we began worrying about her reliability. And we began 

complaining to Headquarters about her. And I notice in the memos that it's in my memo, 

and I think reference to her is also in Margaret Gerber's memo to the District director. 

And I came across something which refers to her at a certain date, seeing her walking in 

Wolfratshausen with this Army lieutenant or colonel or whatever. So, we, this was a great 

source of concern to us. And UNRRA didn't act on it, and that was a source of concern to 

me .  
 

Q: That's interesting because in thinking about speaking with you, I know I'd hear about 
what this situation camp was Œ but I guess I didn™t really anticipate hearing that you 

would have to fight for the people over the treatment of the people. In other words, that 

you had to become , or you did become , an advocate. You had to choose sides in a way. 

Do you agree with that?  
 

A: Oh, no, I didn't see it as choosing sides. I mean, some  of the things that I was doing was 
almost measured choices, if you want to say down the mi ddle. Like, my mi dŒ like my 

mi dnight checks. Or the Œ three o'clock in the morning looking for a meat, for a butcher, 

once a month or twice a month, which left them 28 other days. 
 

07:11:23 

 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0362

Or my encounter with Rabbi Halberstam in down the mi ddle. That is, I Œ even with those 
things Œ the Army was complaining like crazy about me. But I think, incidentally, if you 

were Œ which you are not going to do really, but 
historians will, look at the files on some 
of the other camps. Whether or not they led to the removal of the director or not. You'll 

see similar themes being played out. Because I have folders based on meetings we were 

having at headquarters where we were being 
briefed about not handing out cards and new 
cards. On how among us we were upset by it and protesting it and so on. So, I wasn't  the 

only one. And there was, for example, at Landsberg, you had older, older people in 

charge with more experience, like Lee Srole
45
 who was chief welfare officer. And they 
would get into the New York papers and Leon, what's his name , the head of the camp, so 

this was going on different places. 
 

Q: Did you ever feel torn between your allegiance to the U.S. military and your allegiance to 
being a Jew Œ and the Jews in the camps?  
 

A: I never had that conflict. I just, it wasn't  my allegiance to America that was at issue, it 
was my refusal to deal with stupid people. Who happened to be American. I mean that 

was never a problem for me . If I'm dealing with a Œ if you™re dealing with one of these 

gun groups out in the west who raise the American flag and you protest against it, it isn't 

that you™re anti-American, you're against that mentality. So, I've never had that problem. 

And I'm not a radical, politically. I'm a centrist. So, I don't have any problem with that. 
 

Q: What was the most difficult thing about your job?  

 

A: I think when, when one come s down to it, the most difficult thing about it was dealing 
with the U.S. Army of occupation. Dealing with the DP™s wasn't  as difficult. Dealing 

with Rabbi Halberstam wasn't  that difficult.
 I mean, you know, the riot was difficult, but 
it wasn't  Œ I could understand it. 
 

07:14:50 

 
And, I reme mber once, I don't know for what reason, the DP™s went on a hunger strike 

protesting something. I convened a big meeting in the auditorium, hundreds of people 

there, and I, I set out to break the strike. And I say to them, "Listen, I would rather be a 

teacher in Brooklyn than director of this camp." And they laugh and that breaks the 

strike. That was the relationship I had with them. That was not difficult. I had, I had 

confidence in my ability to deal with that. And they had confidence in me. I notice in the 

stuff around the Army effort to get rid of me , that there's a me mo from Becky Althoff 

who worked Œ there were two me mos from Becky Œ she worked for the Joint, attached to 

the team, and one is to Leo Schwarz, the head of Joint in Germany, to alert him to what 

was going on up there and enlist him in the effort to offset the Army. And the second, 

was talking about a small group meeting to plan a strategy, a group strategy, about 
                                                          
45
 Leo Srole 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0362

retaining me  and protecting me . And that included Becky, some  of the Jewish Agency 
people and one or two other staff people. And then they had a large staff meeting the 

following morning and they wrote someone wrote a petition or something, and there are 

like 18 signatures on the petition. So, that was not my difficulty. My difficulty was this 

anomaly of being an infantry soldier in the 39th Regime nt and confronting this problem 

with those schmucks who have no understanding. I mean, look, one of these guys come s 

on an inspection during Pesach. I guess it must have been that guy who came for five 

days. And we walk into the kitchen. Now, the kitchen is closed for Pesach. They've been 

giving rations in one way or another. And, I walk with him into the mi ddle of the floor in 

the kitchen it's empty and there's a pile of human defecation on the floor. And he, for 

him, that's a sign of poor admi nistration and poor sanitary control. We walk to the johns 

and there's defecation in the john on the floor, maybe on the toilet seat, I don't remember. 
 

07:17:48 

 
We go outside and behind there against the wall, there's some defecation. The stupid guy, 

how does he think I feel about that?  I understand how he's feeling about it. But he's not 

giving a thought, that is he's not giving a t
hought that, if I had my way, if I had found it 
two hours earlier, we would have cleaned it up. But the place was out of use for two or 

three days at the time. So, it happened. Nobody was going in there, so we didn't find it. 

You know, I won't tell you the whole story of 
this, in 1961, I am in Œ I'm working with 
my Mayor Wagner's office, I'm a senior management consultant on admi nistration and 

I'm handling health, welfare, youth and so on. The Deputy Mayor calls me  up Œ I won't 

give you the whole story Œ gives me something, "Take care of this." It's about Harlem 

hospital, conditions in the emergency room. I've been in the mayor's office then five to 

six years, so I know what weight I have, okay?  And I've been heavily involved for two 

years in dealing with various problems of hos
pital admi nistration. I call the Dean of the 
Columbia School of Public Health, whom I've been working with very closely for two 

years, and I say, "Help me out on this one, I'll rendezvous with you at the emergency 

room at Harlem hospital." We  go there, I won't detail what we find. At the end of the 

evening, 10 o'clock at night, nine o'clock at 
night, I call the Commi ssioner of Hospitals at 

his home in Staten Island, and I tell him where I am, what I have found and what I am 

doing, what I'm going to be doing about it immediately. And he raises his voice, "What 

the hell are you doing there?  You're not Commi ssioner of Hospitals, etc., etc." I just say 

back to him, "What the hell have you known about this?  Have you acted on it?  I'm acting 

because of dereliction." Anyway, over the weekend, we took care of the problem and 

[inaudible] I report to the Deputy Mayor on Monday -"All taken care of." On 

We dnesday, the Amsterdam News 60 come s out blasting us because it's a crazy paper, 

okay?  Ten days later, the Mayor announces that he's promoting me  to Deputy City 

Admi nistrator and 10 days after that, he's announcing that the Commi ssioner of Hospitals 

has resigned and he's appointing the Dean of the Columbia School of Public Health as 

Commi ssioner, okay?  
 

07:21:20

So, I sort of know what heft and weight, and so on, is. I didn't know it all in 1946 in the 
camp. But, there's something in me historically, my development, which has enabled me, 

not that I don't take crap, but gives me some inner strength not to always put up with it. 

And that was what was involved here. Maybe 
I was too Œ whatever. But they were too Œ 
worse, you see. And I should add that two to three weeks after I left the camp, there was 

another riot situation, a march on the town, and one or two Jews were killed by the 

soldiers because they wouldn't retreat. That is, when facing a gun, they went forward, not 

backwards and we knew that. And we knew that we had to deal with them within the 

family so they didn't see us with guns. And they didn't see the Army with guns. And 

when they saw the guns, they got hurt. And I have newspaper clippings on that incident. 

So, I'm satisfied it wasn't  a personality matter. Now, I have a memo that Ira Hirschmann, 

who was LaGuardia™s emissary, Hirschma nn had been a Senior Vice President in 

department stores in the '30s. He must have helped raise money for LaGuardia, later they 

became very close. During the war, Roosevelt appointed him with some special 

Ambassadorial rank to be stationed in Turkey, and Hirschma nn was arranging for the 

escape of Jews from Hungary and Bulgaria into Turkey. 
 

07:24:05 

 
So, he was, in his own way, an old hand. And 
LaGuardia sent him over, he wanted to get 

rid of General Morgan
46
 because of the British influence on the European operation. And 
he spent the day with me. And I quickly realized he was a guy I could trust and I get Œ 

put it all out to him. And in his memo, which is in June, "the Army is out to get Henry 

Cohen." He starts out, "Henry Cohen" Œ this is something I didn't get until he came across 

it 1981, and he called me about it, that he had it Œ "Henry Cohen, director, who appears to 

have done a heroic job under impossible conditions is now under fire from the Army. 

They made an investigation here, found the sanitary conditions unsatisfactory, which is 

correct, and in addition they felt that Mr. Cohen was pushing the welfare side too much, 

was neglecting the other side for the rehabilitation of the people. A devastating report has 

been sent to Headquarters by General McBride
47
, Ninth Division Comma nder, and they 
have asked for Mr. Cohen's removal. The staff has protested and the entire community 

had a ma ss meeting, as, as the people have developed an affection for him and his 

understanding of the problem. Not like the U.S. Army. It was two days after this mass 

meeting that a riot occurred at this camp. This is a concrete example of the Army bucking 

the job of rescue, failing to support and permit people who understand the human side of 

the problem to function'. The people in the camp chose to go on a complete hunger strike 

unless Mr. Cohen was retained. He will probably be removed by the Army." 
 

Q: Ultimately, what did happen?

A: I don't know the answer to that, Katie. What I find in my material, is a letter of 
resignation dated sometime in May, and it's a two or three page letter, and on top of it, it's 
marked "void." Then, I also note, these cables the, I mentioned to you, from Samuel, 

Professor Samuel Joseph, Chairman of the Sociology Departme nt, at City College, 

offering me a teaching post in September Œ "Reply in by Wednesday." I don't remember, 

I have no indication of how I handled that. 
 

08:01:04 

 

A: ...very little in my records during the month of June, all the action seems to have been in 
May. Very little in my records Œ yeah, all '46. Very little in my records, other than the 

Hirschmann memo, which is something like June 10th, but then, I notice a cable dated 

June 26th from Professor Samuel Joseph, City College. "Are you planning to return 

shortly?  Have two or three courses open. Will hold up until you cable me." Then, in a 

more detailed cable without a date that I can't  recognize Œ I have the real cable, but I can't  

read the date he sent to my brother who was in Munich, nearby. In which he actually 

outlines which courses and where and what days, "must have your answer by Wednesday 

morning for program printing, regards." Alright. Let's say it's the same day, June 26th. 

June has 30 days, 44 days. Then, I have July 10th Œ sorry, July 2nd, six days later, 

resignation from UNRRA. NowŒ 
 

Q: Yourresignation?  

 

A: My resignation. A very brief me mo. "I should like to inform you of my decision to resign 
from UNRRA, and am herewith giving one month's notice. According to our discussion 

today, this decision is a tentative one." And I don™t understand that. "However, I want all 

steps to be taken so that in case I finally and definitely do decide to resign after a short," 

something or other, "there will be no delay in departure." Okay? 
 

Q: Sir, we need you to sit up. 

 

A: Yeah, on July 15th, which is roughly two weeks later, there's a me mo which indicates 
that I've left the camp and I'm now reporting directly at Headquarters. And on that same 

day, July 15th, I go off for seven days of annual leave to Scandinavia. And I had a 

marvelous time. And in Stockholm, I visited relatives of one of my father™s closest 

friends. It was ma rvelous. I'd never been to Scandinavia before. Anyway, so I'm back 

roughly the 22nd, 23rd. My resignation is effective on August fourth. And on August 

fourth I am issued, and I think I initiate, travel authorization fr om Munich to Washington 

via London. But now I'm going to give you a treat that you weren't expecting. In Paris, I 

arrived for a few days en route, and, and aunt of mi ne had sent me  the name  and address 

of a cousin in Paris. 
 

End of Tape #7

08:04:56 

 
So, I go to this address and I find this Sheftel cousin running a butcher shop. And, oh, 

was that a wonderful experience. And she has three chilŒ young children. They survived 

the war in the Alps, but her husband was taken and killed. And I see these, her children Œ 

she died about eight or nine years ago Œ I see her children to this day whenever I go to 

Paris. And they'r e a wonderful family. So, the 
Sheftels are really something, aren't  they?  
So, that's the end of the story. I got back, presumably, I don't know, went by boat from, I 

think, from Liverpool, to Canada, then back to the States, so I must have arrived the third 

week of August or so. I must have gone down to Wa shington, back to New York, and I 

started teaching in September. 
 

Q: Any sort of debriefing or anything?  

 

A: I, there must have been some thing in Wa shington, but once back in New York, I kind of, 
I was in touch with a number of Jewish organizations and have different speeches I gave 

on different occasions. 
 

Q: How did it change you?  How do you think it Shaped you, rather than changed?  

 

A: Well, I don't really know. I Œ you know, it probably strengthened me. I don't recall Œ and 
I, I'm a person who can do a lot of soul searching Œ I don't recall ever really soul 

searching about the circumstances of the departure. Incidentally, I, I, my supervisor, 

Helen Matousek, I Œ she was in New York for ma ny years before moving out to Seattle. 

So, I used to see her frequently. And we rarely talked about the old days, specifically. 

She'd been through it all with me. I should tell you, there is one little story on one of the 

meetings out in their headquarters. After dinner, she and I would sit aside, and she said to 

me, "Henry, most people live their lives with
 the glass half full. You live your life and 

ma y always lived your life with the glass overflowing." 
 

08:08:09 

 
So, she had my number. Sam Zisman, was a city planning consultant, it turned out. So I 

used to run into him, he was from Texas, I used to run into him at Planning Œ National 

Planning meetings and we had a good relationship. I used to see Richard Wi nslow. I 

don™t know if I told you this story. There was the summe r of '67 Œ '47, by then he was the 

Secretary General of the United States Mission to the United Nations in New York, and I 

still hadn't resolved my housing. I'd float from one rental to another, sub-rental to 

another. And I was subletting an apartment on 
East 94th Street, way east, which is those 
days was really old, old teneme nt. And I had a 
four story walk-up. And his family used to 

go to the Cape for the summe r, so anyway, some how or other, he decided to move in with 

me . It was next door to a laundry that was spewing out a lot of smoke. And every 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0362  
45 
 
morning we'd be leaving this slum building in our seersucker suits, going to our 
respective jobs. Roger Masteude, I was very close to him and his family for 25 years until 

he divorced and went west and his wife  went 
west. But, I'm still in touch with him within 
the last month on the phone or by letter. So, I'm in touch, I've been in touch with a 

number of these people and, how did it shape me ?  I don't know, it probably added 

some thing to the experience and so on. Added to my heft in certain ways as an 

admi nistrator and experience and politically. What's interesting, basically, is in my 

younger years in New York City, I really wasn't  close to the ma yors, with O'Dwyer
48
 and 
Impellitteri
49
, but with Wa gner I was. And with Lindsay
50
 I was. I wasn't  the closest 
confidante, but I had a personal relationship with them. And, in each of these 

relationships, I was able at different times to talk Œ what I regarded as turkey Œ to them. If 

I felt it needed to be, certain things needed to be said, I would say them. And, I remember 

one meeting with Lindsay, had some  problem, and when he left the room, my then boss, 

said to me , "I don't think you ma de yourself very popular." 
 

08:11:28 

 
But, to me it didn't matter, I had to say what I had to say. And, with Wagner, the 

interesting thing, we used to have lunch every year or two until his death, and in 1986, I 

think, I had, I had read a book, I had read a book about his father, the senator, and I, I 

realized for the fi rst time as a result of reading it, that they were an immi grant family. 

You know, for me, he was Yale and Catholic, upper scale, and all that, I'm still the ghetto 

boy, and Œ but I suddenly realized that his father was an immi grant, too. And I learned 

about the family' And it Œ I'd never heard him speak about it. So, I had lunch with him in 

'86, and I took this up with him. And I said, "Bob, this is the year of the immi grant, I 

think you ought to found Œ find an occasion where you can speak on the subject." And he 

did. He got an award that year from CUNY
51
, and the first paragraph of his speech was 
on his immi grant background. So, I've been able to do, to be direct. And Koch
52
 I had 
never worked for Koch, but if I see him on some thing, not recently, but I, I mi ght say to 

him Œ I did at dinner one night, in his th
ird year Œ "Don™t you have anybody on your staff 
who knows how to let people you're firing off easy?  Do you have to always get PR to let 

someone go?  What about getting it once every other time, or once every third time, do 

you need it every time? " Then I took up some cases with him. "They were nice people. 

Why did you have to do it? " So, you know, in the old days they used to talk about, they 

used to divide people into people who have the gyroŒ their inner gyroscope?  And I 

happen to be a person like that. And, if you want to deal with me , you've got to Œ and it's 

uncomfortable Œ you have to put up with that part of me  if you want to get some thing out 

of me . And I can do a lot of good things.

Q: I wonder when you think about the experience in terms of, we just talked about how it 
shaped you, but what it did to your personal perception of being a Jew?  Working with the 
displaced people and, you've written about the stories, etched faces. 
 

08:14:32 

 

A: Yeah, you know, I was so formed in that way, that it's hard for me  to see other, the other 
increments which, I'm sure there are. But, in 1949, when I was in England teaching, I ran 

into some of my Israeli friends, either in London or Paris or whatever. So, they arrŒ like 

they arranged my trip to Salzburg and Switzerland, so they arranged, on the next holiday 

at the University Œ they used to run six week, trimester, six weeks in between Œ They 

arranged for me to go on an immi grant boat fr om Marseilles to Israel Œ and Evelyn
53
, 
along with me. And then, not all the time, but half the time, they were putting us up in 

different places and so, I had the experience then of comi ng in on the Kedmah. Into the 

Haifa harbor early in the morning and seeing that Haifa amphitheater. Few people see it 

these days because no one come s in by boat, but come  in by airplane. What an 

experience. So, I was in Haifa on the first anniversary of establishment of the state. I 

stood on a roof watching the parade and I lectured city planning at the Technion
54
 and 
one or two other places. And, went to kibbutzim and they arranged for a Föhrenwald 

reunion at WI ZO
55
, the Woman™s Zionist Organization. They got announcements out in 
the press and radio. Three hundred people turned out' So, there are these different 

increments and I don't, I haven't subaggregated it, you know?  
 

Q: Do you reme mber anything about that reunion?  What some one said to you?  

 

A: No, you know, so overwhelming. You know, I reme mber on that particular visit, I was 
riding on a bus and suddenly a ma n turns at me , extends his hand, and says, "Herr 

Direktor.
56
ﬂ You know, that's a pretty heady experience. You know, you need some  
compensation for all the "sturm und drang." So, I've demonstrated I can take the "sturm 

und drang" and I'm entitled to some of the things that come with it. You know, it's like 

combat, hat Œ I don't get much out of that, I didn't get anything out of Ninth Division Œ 

but what I got out of it was my own sense of
 inner satisfaction at having served. And, but 
it's, it's an interesting part of history because there were really so few people around and 

it tells one so much about institutions Œ good and bad. 
 

08:18:15 

 
And, but I'm sure most of the people, whether they came to the United States, I ran across 

one fellow for ma ny years, who went into the engineering area. Another fellow was a 

dermatologist. I came across a letter just yesterday and I went to the phone book to see if

he was still around and I didn't see his name. I saw his second name, but not his first 
name. I may call some of the relatives. But, in that sense, you can't  recreate it, you can't 

remember. And yet, it has to be an important part of the history. 
 

Q: Do you know anything about what it is now?  Has it been razed?  

 

A: Oh, I'll tell you, no, it still, it's been reconstructed as a, as a, some kind of community. 
Because Susan Levin Œ who was born in the camp in about 1948 Œ visited it about three 

years ago. I ran into her, she told me . But, what's happened in 50 years, as in most urban 

areas, is that the city has spread. The urbanization has spread. The suburbanization is part 

of the urbanization, so I have an impression that today it, that area, is simply a stop on 

whatever rapid transit system Munich has. So, she Œ yeah, anyway, she went there, I don't 

know if she knocked on a door or not. No. 
 

Q: Just a coupleŒ 

 

A: Yeah, but I've been back to Munich, I had no interest in going back. 

 

Q: You me ntioned there being a lack of community space at the camp. Therefore, what, 
what did people do?  Where did they congregate?  Where did they sit around and gossip?  I 

mean Œ or did that not happen?  
 

A: Yeah, well, there was a big community center. There was a big kitchen facility. I don't 
remember now what the lateral space around the community center was. So I mean Œ so 

people are talking when they'r e standing in line waiting for food. " There were programs 

in the community center and the theater Œ I don't know whether every night, I don't 

remember that Œ but, they must have been fairly frequent. On the other hand, there is also 

evidence that people didn't rely completely on the movies we were showing. They went 

to the cinema in the town. Incidentally, I, I, I neglected to say this, it hadn't occurred to 

me at the time, on the Œ at the time of the riot, one of the things that I realized was that 

there would be Jewish DP™s in the cinema . By the time the movie was over, they would, 

word would be getting around. I didn't know what would be happening to them when the 

movie let out. So, we took a batch of automobiles en route to the police station, en route 

to the camp, and we stopped off at the cinema  and, during a break in Œ when they were 

changing the film, I made an announcement that when it was over we'd pick them up and 

take them back. Most of them left then and there, they didn™t wait for the end of the 

cinema . So, anyway, people did different things
. They went to Munich, that is, they Œ you 

know, I'm not Œ there wereŒ 
 

Q: They could come  and go?  

 

A: They could come  and go, they, they were, they had friends or relatives in other places. 
So, there, there was no computer, so people learned to be in touch with one another by 

conversation. I noticed in the camp newspaper there are several pages of listings of 

USHMM Archives  RG-50.030*0362

people looking for people from different pl
aces. So, that was another communication 
system. 
 
Q: What else took up their time?  I mean, did people get work during the day?  Or, you said at 
one point Œ I'll just ask it that way. 
 

A: We ll, most people were working. Or they were in classes. The only ones, other than the 
black ma rketers, but they were working, too. They were outside handlin
57
. Just as a word, 
I came across in my notes, reference to the chief of police, allegations with regard to him 

and the black market came to me and I let it go. That was a big one, whatever it was. 
 

08:24:07 

 

Q: The DP police? 

 

A: Yeah, I let him go. And there were some charges about the chairman of the camp 
committee. And I went to the camp committee and I discussed it and they suspended him. 

I don't have any further record of what happened. So, people were engaged, reme mber 

food took time. You had to wait on line three times a day. Not everyone was waiting, 

people would come  back to the fa milies. Now, there were the wome n and the pregnant 

wome n, and they had children. They were taking care of children. So, there were some , 

we had, we didn't have space for a mi kvah, you know that™s a ritual bath. So, you know, 

there were problems, but it isn't as if people were locked in space. See, that was a big 

difference between this and the concentration camp. They had a little money, they Œ you 

know, however they got it, could move some where or other. I don't reme mber how we 

dealt with the money problem. We may even have had a truck that went into Munich 

twice a week or Œ for some hours. I don™t remember. 
 

Q: You told a story earlier when the ma n came from the Army, when he went into the 
kitchen and some body had defecated in there. Why would they do that?  Why wouldn't 

they go to the toilet? Is that something? 
 

A: I guess, I guess that's part a function of 
the breakdown of the inner self. Now, I know no 
one in this room has ever felt an overwhelming impulse to go to the bathroom, to urinate 

or to defecate. I know that no one in this room has ever had the experience of letting a 

little go in the underwear. But even under such pressures as that, people with an inner 

discipline, shoot desperately to a place where they can let go. Alright?  So, one has to 

assume in these cases Œ not with the freezing in the winter, that was a different situation, 

I Œ but, here Passover, in April, one has to assume that someone or several, had certain 

impulses and there was not enough of an inner discipline to move them to an appropriate 

place to discharge. That's my, how else can I explain it?  Can you think of another 

explanation?

Q: Very long line to go?  

 

A: What do you mean?  

 

Q: That they had gone to the regular toilet and mi ght have to wait?  

 

A: No. By the law of averages, no, in a norma l situation, by the law of averages, there are 
two or three bathrooms per building, the buildings are very close, so if this is lined up, it 

wouldn't have that. 
 

Q: So, you™re saying that some where in that person's experience, perhaps, you know, 
whatever that experience was, before liberation, that they just kind of lost some of theirŒ 
 

A: Yeah, the starch, in the system. They were beaten down so much. They had to lose some  
of the starch. But what's interesting is on certain things they had starch and other things 

they didn't have starch. On certain things they had stubborn resistance capability and on 

other things, they didn™t. It takes awhile to reform the personality. AndŒ 
 

Q: You saw that happen?  

 

A: Yeah, but yet again, my vantage point doesn't  enable me to see it person by person. It 
isn't the matter of it disable Œ doesn't  enable me, my attention wasn't  drawn to it person 

by person.

Q: What did you learn from the experience?  Running the camp?  

 

A: We ll, one thing, probably, you asked me  about Jewish ma tters before. See, I'm, I'm an 
amalgam of Jewish and universalist, and, and humanist. And, I believe very strongly in 

this. But, I also believe that one of the most powerful engines in homo sapiens is the 

existence, and probably the necessity, for the "we/they" relationships. So, when I think 

about the "we/they" relationships in the context of my being Jewish and universalist, it 

means to me, in terms of Jewishness, pride, fullness in certain ways, identification, 

values. But, in a certain sense, as "we," we shouldn't kill them. We  should find a way of 

relating to the "they." All "they's" should find ways of relating to the "we's." So, in a 

certain sense in the camp, the "we" part was strengthened, as, as against the need for 

balance in the "we/they" phenomenon. 
 

09:03:20 

 
And the Army that I was dealing with Œ which I don't generalize to the whole Army, 

became the they, more than the Germans Œ became the they, in a sense Œ and that 

probably does make me feel a little uncomfortable Œ because for me, I strong Œ I believe 

strongly that all people need to have a "we" relationship, but they shouldn™t convert that 

"we" relationship into a hostile, hostility to "they." You see?  I mean, if you take for 

example, that thing I went through quickly with you, about Harlem hospital, where I was 

going in to do a lot of good, and did, the outcome  in the Amsterdam News three days 

later, five days later was from their "we" into an act of aggression against the "they." And 

it was so, so uninspired, so uncalled for. And, so you get this all the time, and, and 

because, sometimes it™s because of the way in which they act. That is the Katyúsha
58
 
rockets make our we act in certain ways. And that distresses me, even though I accept the 

counteraction. But, I basically prefer for the walls to come down a little bit more among 

people. Even though they need for their well-being, a "we" relationship. So, in, in Œ at 

UNRRA, because of the behavior of some  of these officers and soldiers, they were 

building up some  of the walls in me  that I feel uncomfortable with. But, hell, even Rabbi 

Halberstam had a little bit of that, right? 
 

09:06:03 

 
So, I Œ but I've learned Œ what I've been leafing all my life, is the complexity of the 

ﬁwe/they" relationships. I mean, people today focus, among other things, among a million 

things, focus on Sri Lanka. I've been watching the Sri Lanka phenomenon for 20 years,

now. I always fi nd these things that are illustrations of that, that bother me, disturb me, 
but show how difficult it is to deal with. 
 

Q: I'd like ask you to show us this picture that hangs in your hall, andŒ 

 

A: This picture is me speaking to the hundreds upon hundreds of people collected for the 
Maccabi games. Which was an athletic festival in, I don't know, probably May, because 

the weather was fine. It could have been June. And, we had hundreds of younger people 

engaged in acrobatics and all kinds of athletics and it was a really a marvelous day. 

[technical conversation] 
 

A: This is me  pointing some thing out to General Frederick Morgan who was the head of 
UNRRA in Europe. He had been Eisenhower's Deputy British Comma nder during the 

European invasion. He was the highest British military officer. And, and I took him to the 

hospital, there are other pictures of him in the hospital and the vocational training 

facilities and in different parts of the camp. 
 

A: Okay, this is a picture of a Rabbi, I believe it's Yitzhak Herzog, who was the Chief Rabbi 
of Palestine. He came to spend the Sabbath weekend with us. And, the camp was just in a 

state of exhilaration over his visit because, for the people in the camp, this was a new 

beginning, new life. Now, I just want to point 
out, at his right shoulder, is an American 
by the name  of Rabbi Wohlgelerinter. 
 

09:08:48 

 
I've never, never figured out whom the hell he was representing, but he was around all 

the time. Now, when you look beyond Rabbi Herzog's right shoulder, partly cut by his 

hat, is the Mizrachi Rabbi, I can't  remember his name. He was a marvelous human being. 

We used to call him the red rabbi because he had red hair compared to the Rabbi 

Halberstam, who had black hair. Then at Rabbi Herzog's left shoulder is Gustav 

Lachma n, who was chairman of the camp committee, a wonderful ma n. He became a 

high school principal in Israel. And then beyond hi s left shoulder is me in Army dress, or 

UNRRA dress. I should add that Rabbi Herzog was the father of Rabbi Chaim Herzog, 

who was the President of Israel. And, some  years ago when I went to Israel, I put 

together an album with the pictures I had of Rabbi Herzog and I got an audience with the 

President. And we went over it, he was a young soldier, he was approxima tely my age, he 

was in the British Army, and he remembered clearly that visit of his father to Germany. 

So, we had a wonderful 15, 20 mi nutes together 
remi niscing. This is a picture of a flag 

raising ceremony in Hochlandslager. Where we were training some three to 400 young 

people as agricultural workers in kibbutzim. Standing in back of me is the Jewish Agency 

team. To the right as you look at the pictur
e, Sarah Entin passed away, unfortunately, 
early.

Next to her is Liowa Lak, whom I've spoken about before. And next to him is Zviah 
Lahar, whom I also spoke about before. She was the one who called me  after the Hebron 

massacre. This was around Passover time. And again, a lovely occasion. What can I say 

about this picture?  The thing that I always react to when I look at a picture like that, is 

how much eagerness and smiles are on the faces. Because that's the thing that I most want 

to see. And you see it in there, including that head in the back who is raising his chin so 

he'll get into the picture.
