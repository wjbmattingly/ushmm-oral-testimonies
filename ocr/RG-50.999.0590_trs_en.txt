Dora Klaym an was bornTeodoraBasch on January

Here we see Dora sitting on a parkbench with her younger brother,Zdravko.
 
 
On thism ap of Yugoslavia in 1933, thearrow points to Zagreb.
 
 
In this photo 
we see Dora on an outing to the zoo with her parents,Salam on and 
Silva.  Salamon ran abrush

Picturedhere is Dora's maternal grandf ather,Rabbi Josef  Leopold Deutsch.  In 
A p ri l
 
1941, when Dorawas visiting her m aternal grandparents in the sm all town of Ludbreg, 
Germ any invaded Yugoslavia.  Ludbreg becam epartof  a puppet state run by the Ustasa, 
Croatian fascists.
 
 
In June
 
1941, Dora'sparentsand herbrotherwere arrested. Their housekeeper got 
baby Zdravko outof prison andf rom then onDora and Zdravko were shelteredby their 

m other's sister,Giza, and her husband,Ljudevit.  On the lef t we seeAuntGiza.  Onthe right 

we see her husband, Ljudevit.  Thephotoof Ljudevit was takenm any years after this one of  

Gi
za .
 
 
Later in the war, Aunt Giza was denouncedand sent to Auschwitz where she 
perished.  Dora remained in Yugoslavia until1957 and in1958em igrated to the UnitedStates.
 
W eclose with this portrait of  Aunt Giza, Dora, and Zdravko that was taken tobe sent to 

Ljudevit in the concentration cam p where hehadbeen sent.
 
 
In 1957, while on herwa y to Swit zerland, Dora m et DanielKlaym an, who was 
returning to New York from  a year of  post
-
doctoral study as a Fulbright scholar in India. They 
were m arried in Switze rland a year later, andtogether they arrived in the United States in the 

fall of 1958.T hefollowing year Dan and Doracam e toW ashington,DC, and Dan beganhis 

career asa researcher in medicinal chem istry at theW alter Reed Arm y Institute of Research;
 
his work culm inated in his expertise indrug developm entagainstmalaria.
 
         
 
Af ter thebirth of their two children,W anda and Elliot, Dora resum edher education, 
getting degrees in French and in English asa Second Language. She then taught in 

Mo n
tgomery County, Maryland, Public Schools, including 23 yearsat Bethesda

issues. Elliot isaf reelance videographerandowns a video andf ilmproduction company.He is

Af ter Dora retired f rom  full
-
tim e teaching in 1999, shebecam e active as a volunteer 
with this m useum. Herwork here consists prim arily of translating materialf rom  the Holocau
st  

written in Croatian,Bosnian,and Serbian. Her ongoing project is connectedto the Jasenovac 

archive. As we will hear later, Jasenovac was a major concentrationcam p in Croatia. Other 

projectsfor Dora have included the translation of a booklet thataccom panied a 1942 

anti
-
Sem itic exhibit inCroatia, andthe translationof  the captions on a large archive of 
photographs that hadbeen gatheredduring the post
-
W orldW ar II trials in Yugoslavia.
 
         
 
T o add to her language skills Dora continues to learn Hebrew. Shevolunteers weekly 
teaching English to recent im m igrantsata Jewish Com m unity Center. Dora also enjoys 

traveling. She has been toIsrael several tim es where she was happy to reunite with her
 
cousinsandtheirfam ilies. Some of her travels are connected to learning more aboutthe 

events and the afterm ath of the Holocaust. She has attended several conferences of the 

International Organization of Child Survi vors, i ncluding in Poland in2011, when she visited 

3 
 
Auschwitz f or thef irst tim e,and in Berlin in 2014, where she was im pressed by the effortm ade 
by that country to teach about and rem em ber the Holocaust. In 2013 she traveled to herf orm er 

home in Croatia where sheaccom panied thedirector of the Jasenovac archive to the site of  

the concentration camp to view their exhibit.Last summ er Dora returned to Croatiaf orherhigh 

school's 60th reunion.She also visited the sm all town of Ludbregwhere she spentthe war 

years and m uch of  her youth.
 
         
 
Besides FirstPerson, Dora is speaks publicly in other settings including to small 
groups hereatthemuseum. She recently spoke to students andthef aculty at King University 

in Bristol,T ennessee, as well as tom em bersof  the comm unity at a loca
l chu rch .
 
         
 
W ith that
, 
I would like you to join m e in welcom ing our First Person,Dora Klaym an. 
 
>> 
[Applause] 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Dora, thank you som uchf orjoining us today and agreeing to beourf irst 

person.  
W e' ll s t a rt
,  
if you don'tm ind
,  
wi t
h your fam ily in the prewar years. You were 3 years 
old whenW orldW ar IIcam e directly to Yugoslavia in the spring of 1941 when it was attacked 

by Germ any. Before we turn tothehorrors ofthe war and the Holocaust,tell us what you can 

about your f am ily 
andyour lif e inthose pre
-
war years.
 
>> Dora Klaym an: W ell, m y f ather'sfam ily had not been in Zagrebfor a very long tim e.T hey 

hadoriginally com ef rom  the South. My father was born in Rom aniabutas a child already they 

had lef tand they had com e to Zagreb andestablished them selves there. By the time the late 

`
30s cam eabout,m y grandf atherhad already passed away. So it was m y grandmotherthere. 
And there were six siblings in thatf am ily. 
M
y father was only one of the siblings who was f airl y 
invol ved
 
in  c
a nt
orialmusic. As such,he eventually, even though heran the brushm aking 
factory, heendedupmaking, I think, visiting m y m other's hometown.
 
 
So m y m other's f am ily
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  He was a 
cantor
 
there.
 
>> Dora Klaym an:  
Wa
s a  
cantor
. I th in k 
just for the holidays.
 
 
Som y m other'sf am ily is f rom Ludbreg. Andm y m other was born there. But that 
fam ily, too, had com epreviously f rom actually C zechoslovakia, f rom  Slovakia, wherem y 

grandfather becam e a rabbi
 
--
 
trained to be arabbi. T hey hadtwo c
hildren
 
wh
en they cam e to 
Ludbreg, where therewas a sm all Jewish com munity that wantedto have a rabbi. Sohecam e 

with t wo children and subsequently they hadtwo m ore children
;  
oneof  them was m y m other.
 
T he oldestdaughter inthat fam ily, Giza, whom  we saw in thephoto, was actually 15 years 

older thanm y m otherand was sortof  a surrogate mother which, of course,madem e be 

alm ost a surrogate grandchild.
 
 
T hef am ily was well integrated inLudbreg. From thephotosthat I see, because I 
certainly don't ha
ve mem ories of the time before the war, f rom the photographs andf rom  what 

people toldm e,m y grandf ather served in thepublic schools to teach Jewish children. And then 

there was apriest who taughtthe Catholic children, inthe sam e school.
 
 
And I think there were sort of af terschool classes but there is a photograph. I've 
do
na t e d t o t h e m u s eum , so i t ' s  on
line.It's very interesting to me because you seethepriest on 
one side andthe rabbi on theother sideand the restof thefaculty. So that kind of al
wa y s  
m akes me think that relations in the town were good. It's a practically totally Catholic part of the 

world. And thenthe Jews had come infairly r ecent times. 
 
 
S o  tha t wa s tha tfa m ily.
 
And then another person that plays
 
a role in thatf am ily was 
the 
Ljudevit, the director of the savings & loan bank. Andone of hisem ployees was m y aunt 
G i za
. And there was alongtim e relationship, if
 
yo u
I want to call it that. They were in love 

4 
 
between Ludva and Giza, but they did notm arr y f or a very long tim e because
 
--
 
well, I would 
im agine thatone of the problem s was that hewas Catholic and shewas Jewish. Andthere 
was a 10
-
year difference between them, but that wouldn't havem attered
. P
retty comm on in 
Europe to have a10
-
year difference.
 
 
W hen I  que s t i o ne d him a
bout that, 10 years
 
--
 
m any years af terwards, he said, well, 
there was no needto get married.She was quite happy living with her parents andI was quite 

happy li ving with m y m other, so it'sok.
 
 
I have afeeling there were other things inplay. And,of  course,there actually was no 
civi l cerem ony, a civil m arriage.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So
 
only 
reli gious m arriages.
 
>> Dora Klaym an: Soat one point when thewar was getting ver y cl ose, it was
 
'39, I think, and 
they already knew what was happening and they knew 
t h a t  Ch ris t ian
-
J e wis h  f am ilie s  c ou ld  
som etimes survive that the Christianm ate could shelter the Jewishone, they went to Hungar y 

and got married.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And that's because Hungary recognizes ci vil cerem ony?
 

>> Dora Klaym an:  Right. So that'spretty m uch how things stood.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And,of  course, all of that changed sodramatically whenGermany attacked 

Yugoslavia on April
 
6,1941, 76 years ago tom orrow.
 
W hen they attacked, you were away f rom  
Zagreb ona visit with fam ily in Ludbreg.T ellus what you can about the circum stances that 

caused you to beaway at thattim ef rom  yourfam ily, as best you know, and then what 

happenedonce the Germ ansoccupied Yugoslavia.
 
>> Dora Klaym an: W ell, I don't know exactl y wh y I was in Ludbreg at the time staying with my 

grandparents but Ihave a very vi vid m emory of  being onthat train with my grandparents' 

neighbors. AndI have a f eeling that the reason was
 
--
 
I've of ten been asked whetherthe 
reason was thatm y parents were trying to shelter me. But I have afeeling that it was just 

bef ore the war thatI left and bef orethe attackandthat m y parents just had the opportunity to 

sendm e tom y grandparents with the neighbors who happenedto be in Zagreb. I don't know 

thatfor af act but I sort of  also have a
 
memory of  when I think m y parents were taken away 
because
 
I remember sort of people shushi
ng
 
andtalking and keeping things f rom m e. But I 
have afeeling that's the reason they sentm e.
 
 
Also,m y brotherhadalready been born atthat point. My brother was
 
born at the end 
of  January
 
1941.
 
Somy m otherhad the baby.  And it's potential thatthey just sentm e tomy 
grandparents so she could have a bit of  respite.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Did your parents orany other fam ily m em bers try toleave Yugoslavia bef ore 

the 
Germans came in?
 
>> Dora Klaym an:  Yes.  Actually, oneof m y m other's sisters,not Giza but Blankaand her 

husbandand two of my cousins also lived inLudbreg.  And thatuncle of m ine rana store.  

T hey had two lovely children. T hey apparently tried to leave and goto the South, to an area 

which was underItalian rule. It was afairly s af eplacetobe. TheItalians ran sort of a cam p 

but it was not a concentration camp. It was akilling cam p.  So it was a safe place to go. 
 
 
Fairly recently, andI have not yet given it to them useum, but I will, I  found in abox 
that was inm y house p
asses for all f our of  them  to 
go.  Now, I have been told that they actually 
went at onepoint.  Ithink they didn't go all the wa y because that's why the passes seem  brand 

n
ew.  I mean unused sort of.
 
 
I thinkthey must have gone asfar as Zagrebbecause you can't go to Domatia 
[p h] 
without going to Zagrebfirst.  Andthey returned. W hy didthey return?  Because there was a 

5 
 
proclamation that any Jews that had left andwould return will not be arrested.  Hom e, store, 
fam ily, they returned. They did not last very l ong.
 
>> B ill B e n s o n :  S o it wa s  a ll lie s .
 
>> Do ra  K la ym a n :  A ll lie s ,  b ig lie ,  ye s .
 
>> Bill Benson:  Youmentioned Ustasa.  
Ust asa ,  i
t was they who ran
 
--
 
te
ll u s  ab
o ut  U s t a s a.
 
>> Dora Klaym an: They ran Croatia. They were a super nationalist group who had triedfor 

som e time to get political power.  Som e of them  hadbeen inItaly fora while and just waiting 

for the opportunity.  They made an arrangement w
ith  the  Ge
rm ans that would allow
 
them  to 
r
un Croatia in exchange for 
--
 
the governm ent didn't say so but they established that they 
would run the governmentaccording to German wishes in term s of persecuting Jews, Roma, 

whoever else the Germ an wantedpersecuting.
 
 I
n addition
 
--
 
and thiswas reall y their m ain thrust
 
--
 
they wanted to create what they 
called ethnic cleansing.  They wanted to get rid of the
 
Serb population within Croatia. Andso 
they seized the reigns of the governm ent and they ran the governmentas what they called an 

independent state of Croatia. They imm ediately started doing
 
--
 
started running all their laws 
according toGermanwishes.  So persecuting Jews, which is whatconcernsm y f am ily.  That 

m eant losing jobs,notbeing able to goto school, notbeing able to have a business,and 

co nf isca t io n s.  

 
In them useum  there are records ofm y f am ilies where they had to declare absolutely 
ever ything they owned.  T hat com esdown toeven the ridiculous.  Like m y young cousinswho 

were early teens had to declare things like adress, onenecklace, one winter coat.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Literally ever ything they o wned.
 
>> Dora Klaym an: Everything they owned. Right.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Your auntand others learned your parents had been sent to a concentration 

c a m p 
but that your brother hadbeen savedf rom deportation. Tell us what happened to your 
parents and what happened with your brother, how he was abletonot bedeported.
 
>> Dora Klaym an: Som y parents were deportedfairly earl y.  Andthere was a holding area
 
in  
Zagreb. T his is where they were taken.T hey were, of course
 
--
 
as I m entioned, m y brother 
was a baby at thetim e and they took thebaby along to this gathering cam p. They asked the 

Ustasa who were running this cam p if  she could have the baby. T hey generously ga ve her the 

baby.  I'm  beingf acetious, of  course. That'soneof  thethings that Ican't im agine what it was 

like for m y mother, to hand the baby, but shedid.
 
 
T hen thehousekeeper calledm y Aunt Giza and her husbandandthey cam eand got 
h im
. They broughthim to Ludbreg. T hat's one of the memories thatI have.  I have a memory 
of  thatbaby arriving and crying.  Of  course,Iwas a spoiled little 3
 
1 /2
-
year
-
old.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You had been staying with her.
 
>> Dora Klaym an: It was at m y gr
andparents that he came.  I rem em ber that.  T hat's one of  
those memories.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You rem em ber him com ing to thehouse.
 
>> Dora Klaym an:  Yeah.  So from then on he was alwa ys with m e.
 
 
I don't know whether you wantm e to continue what happened to the rest of the people 
in Ludbreg.  But in1942, everybody was deported.
 
 
T hat's anotherm em ory.  At that point,I rem em berbeing in Giza and Ljudevit's house.  
And it was sortof evening.  Andeverybody was there gathered,everybody cryin g, carr ying 

bags 
and pillows, I remem ber, and saying goodbye tom e, saying goodbye to me andm y 
brother.  Atthat point he was already walking.   He was a littleboy.
 
Ever ybody, in 1942, 

6 
 
ever ybody was deported exceptf orm y Uncle Ljudevit, who was Catholic, m y Aunt Giza, an
d 
m y brotherand me. W e were left behind.
 
>> Bill Benson:  But the rest of the Jewish population inLudbreg was gone?
 
>> Dora Klaym an:  Yes.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And that scene,here, I believe in 1942, then your Uncle Ljudevit was arrested 

and sent tothe Jasenovac concentration camp, and that meant youand your brother werestill 

at home with your Aunt Giza.
 
>> Dora Klaym an:  Yes.  And it was later. And the reasonfor that is
 
--
 
I think Ineed tom ention 
wh y he was deported. Alm ost as soon asthe U
st a sa  to
okover, there was a slow but 
consistent uprising in the population.  Part ofthepopulation was wil li ng to go along with the 

Ustasa who now had an armedforce. But the other part were people who joined the partisans.  

T here was a partisanuprisings, beginning of af airly extensive part of f ighting.  And that 

f ighting was fairly exte nsive around Ludbreg,ver y f requent.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And this is between Ustasa
 
--
 
>> Dora Klaym an: And the partisans, yes.
 
 
So the reason why m y uncle was arrested at thatp
oint
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  As you said, he was not Jewish.
 
>> Dora Klaym an:  Hewas not Jewish.  He was Catholic.
 
>> Bill Benson:  But he was arrested.
 
>> Dora Klaym an:  Hewas not the only person arrested. There were other people who were 

sort of the leading citizens of the town.  And he certainly was.  Not only was he abank director 

buthe was also
 
--
 
thefam ily was an old Ludbreg fam ily.  It was am inor aristocracy.  He had 
been involved in just about anything civic one can thinkof .  He had been amayor
 
at one point.  
He was instrum ental in putting togetheranorchestra.
 
>> Bill Benson: T ruly a leading f igure in town.
 
>> Dora Klaym an:  Just a leadingf igure.  And then other people
 
--
 
he was particularly involved 
in m usicand that washelpful lateron.
 
 
T he other leadingf igures, people, you know, som ebody thatowned
 
--
 
wasn't a 
bookstore exactly but sort of the Staplesof  the time. A number of people who were leading 

f igures inthat town were arrested.  Andthe reason was that they were accusedof helpi
n g 
partisans, which, of  course they were doing.  And the Ustasathen used them asanexam ple, 

arrestedthese people and sent them to whatwas the most notorious of  camps, and this was 

the camp Jasenovac.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Until I m et you, I hadnever heard of Jasenovac and possibly that'strueof  

m ostpeople in our audience. You said it was an especially horrif ic,brutal cam p.
 
>> Dora Klaym an: It was.  It was a very brutal cam p that was diff erentf rom som ething like 

Auschwitz, that was ran in som e sortof  a very organi zed m annerbut it was equally brutal. It 

was run by people who just hadabsolutely norespectfor human kind. T hey were using of ten 

prim itive im plem ents to kill people, not to speak of  thefact that people were starving, expos ed 

to the elementsand just hanging, killing with knives, throwing people in the river next door.  It 

was a ver y brutal camp.
 
 
And Jews, Rom a, political prisoners likem y uncle, anda lot of Serbs perished there.
 
>>
 
Bill Benson: W hatdo you know about your uncle'stim e while he was there? 
 
>> Dora Klaym an: W ell, he was
 
--
 
he wasn'tas young asm y father, for example.  He came 
f rom af am ily that somehow seem ed tonot be in very good physical shape. So this is how h
e 

lost almosta dozen of  his brothers and sisters by the tim e I knew him . So he would nothave 

7 
 
really been able to withstand the treatment there.  But theyf oundout
 
--
 
the Ustasa knew he 
had run a bank so they put him  in an off ice torun their paperwork.
  
And that ishow he 
m anaged to survive.
 
 
T he other thing they wanted him  to do, they knew thathe couldorganize an orchestra 
or something andtheywanted to be entertained.  He playedthe violin.  He put together a 
group.  Heused totell m ehow he would
 
takeas many peopleas hecould to save them f rom  
having to work outsidein the coldand rainand snow and organizedthem  to be in a choir and 

then they would perform for the Ustasa.  Andall of  this kindof  allowed him to stay alive.
 
 
He also,I think Im entioned to you that he saw m y f ather while he was there.  My 
m other hadalready passed away, I think.  But m yf ather was still there.  Actually, we know t hat 

m y f ather survi ved to the endof  the war.
 
>> Bill Benson:  In Jasenovac?
 
>> Dora Klaym an: In Jasenovac, yeah.  Butat the end there was abreakout and he was 

am ong those who broke out of the cam pandwas caught and shot. But he was there
 
--
 
he 
survi ved through the very end.
 
 
M y U
ncle Ljudevit saw m y f atherthere and he talked about it, how they wer
e  c a rryi n g 
bricks and rocks.  Heworked in an infam ous factory that they had therefor making chains or 

som ething like that.
 
>> Bill Benson: W hile your uncle's there, in Jasenovac, you and your brother areat hom ewith 

your Aunt Giza.
 
>> Dora Klaym an:  Ye
s.  
>> Bill Benson:  Until early 1943.
 
>> Dora Klaym an:  Right.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Your Aunt Giza was denounced anddeported. T ell us what you know about 

thatand then whathappened to you and yourbrother. 
 
>> Dora Klaym an: W ell, one of  thethings Imust s
a y is  t h at  in a ll of  th is
 
--
 
well, the town wa s 
shocked thatall of  these Jews were one day gathered anddeported. They were not deported 

by local people. There was Ustasa that cam e f rom elsewhere. Butat onepoint som ebody 

pointed outthat m y aunt was there, som ebody denouncedher. The rest of the town was 

alwa ys ver y s ym pathetic to usand did not give usaway but there was som ebody that pointed 

atm y auntand so shewas taken. She was deported to Auschwitz.
 
 
Now, before
 
--
 
and I know that f or a f act 
because we have docum entation here in the 
m useum  now in the archive and there isa cardf or her.
 
>> Bill Benson:  In great detail describing
 
--
 
>> Dora Klaym an:  Yeah, saying, you know, she died of intestinalproblem s.  Of course, in 

Auschwitz you would die of intestinal problems.
 
>> Bill Benson: W hy do you think you and your brother weren't taken atthe sam e tim e? 
 
>> Dora Klaym an: W ell, I think
 
--
 
Inever know wh y we weren't taken.  It's sort of an enigm a.  I 
would im agine it was because
 
--
 
there were two possibilities.  One that they didn't seem to 
bother with children.  They didn't know
 
--
 
you know, wh y bother? You know, little children.  
T hey tookm y cousinswho were teenagers. But I think the other reason isthat we alwa ys  

happento somehow be in the right place at the right time.
 
 
T he other thing, because we cam ef rom  Zagreb
 
--
 
I takea look and there are books 
now with lists of  Jews in that town. W earenot on the list. And thereason we cam ef rom 

another town. W e were not part of that comm unity.  So if  they went throughthe lanes 

collected everybody, we were noton the list.
 

8 
 
 
So what happened when they tookm y AuntGiza, is that
 
--
 
I so rt ofre m em be r it b ut 
m ostof  it was told to me later. She was rushing outand trying to hide.  Next toour h
ouse 
there was another house thatm y two uncles
 
--
 
m y two aunts, Giza and Blanka were building.  
And we had renters on the groundf loor. Theupstairs hadn't beenf inished.  So she triedto go 
upstairs andhide.  Buton the way she toldthe neighbors on th
e ground f loor.
 
>> Bill Benson: T he renters.
 
>> Dora Klaym an: The renters.  Sheasked them totake careof m y brother andme,and they 

did.  So this was the the Runjakf am ily.  T hey were a fam ily with three children. T he oldestone 

was already a teenager.  They were all older than ourselves.  Mrs.
 
Runjak worked as anurse.  
She was particularly in volved with taking care of  people with glaucom a.  Her husband was a 

painter.  So it was just an ordinary local Catholic fam ily.  And they were willin g to take u
s. 

And it was a very sm all apartm ent.W e all crowded into onebedroom , sort of.  They shared 

whatever they had with us. So that is where we were until m y uncle happenedto returnf rom  

Jasenovac.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Before you tell usabout that,you and your brother were possibly and probably 

theonly Jews lef t inthe town.  And,again,nobody denounced you in that town.
 
>> Dora Klaym an:  No.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Said the Runjaks were hiding two little Jewish kids.
 
>> Dora Klaym an: That was theamazing part.  That's why peoplesaid, you know, you can't 

expect peopletodo things like that because they were in peril but this whole town was reall y 

rem arkable inthat they didn't give us away.  
 

 
Af ter m y aunt
 
--
 
whichunf ortunately we knew who thatperson was.  Af ter the war, the 
one who denouncedher.  And after the war m y uncle,her husband, tried tof ind him  buthe had 

escaped to Austria.  That was the end of that.
 
>> Bill Benson:  As you just started totell us, of  course, your uncle was released buthe was 

released af ter your Aunt Giza had beentaken toAuschwitz.
 
>> Dora Klaym an:  Yes.
 
>> Bill Benson: W hathappened when your uncle cam ehom e?
 
>> Dora Klaym an: W ell, he tried toactually go af ter herandf ind her.  I think people still 

believed that they could do som ething.  I think he still believed thatm aybe he could gether out 

and save her. That was im possible.
 
 
But theother part, which I'm not so sure Iever m entionedbefore, is that my Aunt 
Giza, they still all believed, even the Ustasa, they believed there was some kind of  sense in 

this world.  She actually wrote a letter while my uncle was in Jasenovac, actually wrote a letter 

to the governm ent asking thather husband, who was sucha good citizen, be released.
 
I mean, I would im agine she would have 
been scared to death to do such a thing, to even 

announce her existence but she did it.  People had enormous courage som etimes.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And som e sense of hope.
 
>> Dora Klaym an:  Right.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So your uncle comes hom e.
 
>> Dora Klaym an:  Uncle comes home and collects m y brother andm e.  And now we are with 

h im .
 
 
Oneother thing that I want to mention is that while we were still wit h the Runjakf am ily, 
thatfam ily, as they wer e renters in our house, was all connected with the sam e courtyard.
  
T he  
Ustasa at onepoint were in that courtyard.  So here we were totally exposed ina sense, you 

know, hiding inf ull view.  
 

9 
 
 
W elearned very well t o call Mrs.
 
Runjakmother.  AndI knew well enough at that 
point, as they toldm e even later on, I would 
c a l l  Mrs .
 
Runjakm om whenever it was necessary 
because there wouldbe som eonepresent who was not to be trusted.  My brother was ver y 
devotedtoher and she to him . He called her m om  to the very end of his life.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Youmentionedearlier that,of course, in Ludbreg was f iercef ighting attim es 

between the Ustasaand the partisans. So when your uncle cam eback, you were, as you 

described tom e, essentially li ving in a war zo ne. Tell us about thattim e.
 
>> Dora Klaym an: W ell, the partisans wouldbe inthe hills, in theforests.  T hey were not very 

densef orests. They were just woods.  But they would com edown and attack the Ustasa who 

would be as constant in the town. T henthere would bea battle.
 
 
And what happened during these battles, som
etim es we would know ahead of tim e 
that something would be happening, so we would getout of the house and spend time inthe 

cellar.  And underthe house that we were livi ng in, which was an old house with heavy wa lls 

butunderground there was a cellar where we kept casketsof  wine, thefamily hadthe vineyard 

andthere was wine down there.  But it was dirt f loor, sm all windows high up, lots off rogs on 

the ground jum ping about.W e would go andstay there. And therewere tim es I rem em ber 

that we actually had som e kind of cots and we spent quiteaf ew nights there when the battles 

were ragin g all aroundus.
 
 
But there was one tim e in particular that I remem ber that we couldn't escape into the 
cellar because youhad to get out of the house to go in.  Andthe
 
battle had startedand we 
couldn't go out. Soat that point we had to stay in the house.  I remember one particular time 

when the Ustasa wereon one side andthe partisans were on theother side of the streetand 

they were shooting atoneanotherand the
 
bullets were f lying through our windows.  So you 
couldbe safe where the walls were but the windows let the bullets through.
 
Atone point I 
r e m em be r
 
being very s cared,being in one room . I was sort of  in a saf earea in the corner. My 
uncle was in the otherroom .  And I was crying.  Andhe came. Andthebullethad gone 

through thatbedroom window where he wasandhit just exactly where he was.  So in a sense, 

fact thathe came to comf ortm e saved his life.
 
 
T he bullets had gone through the closets. W e had these armoires,m ade of nice 
walnut wood.  And thebullets would go through and shatter the doors.  And then you would 

see thebulletsthrough.  And later when you took outa table cloth or a sheet, it was all
 
--
 
lik e  
when children takenapkins andm ake
 
lit t le  de s ign s .
 
>> Bill Benson:  You told m e that the worst part for you asa young child, you know, about 5, 6, 

closing on 7by war's e nd, was notf ears of being deported like yourparents or aunt, it was 

being shot to deathby the war itself  that wasgoing on.
 
>> Dora Klaym an:  Yes because some of these battles weref airly f ierce.  T here was one battle 

that wasf ought inour street which af ter thewar was called the 
Street of  the 17th B
r i ga d e.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And this was your street.
 
>> Dora Klaym an:  My street. But now they nam ed itback to what itwas before the war.  So 

it's back to Giva, I think.
 
 
T here was af ierce battle.  And thepartisanswere surrounded.  And the last of them 
didn't want to give up
 
--
 
didn't want to surrender so they gathered 
in one house and threw a 
bomb among them selves and comm itted suicide.  
 
 
It was like everybody was just, you know in shock afterwards.  Even though people 
tried 
tohide these things f rom  me, it was im possible.
 

10
 
 
 
So  with the Ustasa, Idon't remember whichbattle but they had caught so many 
partisans
 
--
 
we used to have maids who were taking care ofm e inthe house.  And oneof  them 
decided to takem e to the m ain square at onepointI think we were going to see a movie.  And 
she was holdingm y eyes but I saw it.  Andthere were bodies hanging f rom every tree in the 

square.
 
>> Bill Benson: T hat's something you rem ember.
 
>> Dora Klaym an:  Yeah.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Dora, this would, of course, all continue until the war's end in May
 
1945.  
W hen the war ended,you and your brother,with your uncle, whatthenhappened? W hatdid 

your uncle try it 
t
o do to bring back some sem blanceof  normalcy, r esum ing your lif e? W hat 
happened? 
 
>> Dora Klaym an: W ell, we went to school. I went to school. Theawf ul thing that 
happened, 
ver y shortly af ter the war, 1946, was thatm y brother contracted scarlet f ever and died within 

three days.
 
 
T o backtrack a little bit, before thathappenedm y uncle was waiting for somebody to 
return to see who will r eturn.
 
>> Bill Benson:  
Som ebody f rom the f am ily.
 
>> Dora Klaym an: Som ebodyf rom thef am ily.  And actually m y parentsdid not return, 

grandparents did not return. Actually alm ostnobody was there.  Som y uncle adopted m y 

brotherand meform ally.  This is where m y nam e comesf ro
m.
 
So we were f orm ally adopted 
andthen unf ortunately m y brotherpassed away.  It was a trem endous shock.
 
>> Bill Benson:  He was 5?
 
>> Dora Klaym an: Tom e it was a great shock
 
--
 
yeah, I was born in 1941, so, yeah.  He was 
really ver y m uch lovedby a lot
 
of people.  Hewas a ver y cute little boy, ver y cle ver.  He used 
to recitepoetry.  He was justa very cute person, child.  EvenI had to admit it.  [Laughter]
 
 
So it was a great shock to m y uncle. Because atthat pointeverybo dy in his family 
had died. 
 
And so he only had usand we only had him.  Some ofm y fam ily did return. W ho  
returned? One of m y father'sbrothers returned andone of m y m other's brothers returned. 

T hey returned because they hadnotbeen inconcentration cam ps. T hey were both in t
he 
Arm y and they were both taken prisoner of  war by the Germ ans, when the Germans attacked.  

So they spent the war in prisoner of  war camps.
 
 
So they returned. Their familiesdid not. Som y m other's brother rem arried,married 
another survivor, a wid ow with two children. Andm y father's brother also cam eand he, in 

particular, came to Ludbreg andthere was a bit of  a problem because he wantedm y brother 

andm e.  Actually, m y brotherm ay have been goneby then.  He wantedm e to go with him .  

Andhe was, again, going to marry another survi vor and he was heading for what was then 

P a le s t ine
 a
nd then later Israel.
 
 
T here was a dispute between m y two uncles.  I was asked tom akea decision where I 
wanted to go.  Of course I hadno idea who this uncle who just camef rom  Germ any was a nd I 

adored UncleLjudevit who was a wonderf ulperson, very kind and was basically m y parentand 

so I said I'm  staying.  So that was that.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And you did.
 
 
And in the little tim e that we have lef t, because we want to have
 
a  lit tle  t im ef o r 
questionsf rom our audience, let's gof orwarda little bit.  Of course, now you're livin g under the 

Comm unist authority in Yugoslavia.  At somepoint it'stimef or you to move on with your 

education. T ell us what you did to actually leave Yugosla via.
 

11
 
 
>> Dora Klaym an: Ok.  SoI f inishedhigh school.  I went tohigh school ina nearby town 
because Ludbreg didn't
 
--
 
it ' s  lik e  2 5
-
kilometers.  Then I went to theUniversit y of  Zagreb 
af terwards.  But during the tim e that I was
 
--
 
>> B ill B e n s o n :  A ll s t ill u n de r
 
--
 
>> Dora Klaym an: Oh, everything.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You couldn't go anywhere else.  Right?
 
>> Dora Klaym an:  No.  But in 1954, Ithink
 
--
 
I was also connectedat one point with another 
m em ber of m y fam ily that survi ved.  Alsom y aunt
 
survi ved with thepartisans.  One ofm y 
father's sister.  Shealso went toPalestine. But oneof m y uncles and his wif e survi ved.  They 

we n t  f r om  H un
gary on train, another story, and were rescuedtoSwit zerland. T hey wrote to 
m e whenI was in highschool or when I was in m id m iddle school. T hey askedme to come to 

vis it .
 
 
So at one point when Iwas in them iddle of high school,I actually went to Switzerland, 
which was quite a deal because in the Com munist countries, you didn't just go to Switzerla nd.  

So I was allowed to go becauseI was regarded as what they calleda victim  of fascism .
 
>> Bill Benson:  So that was a specialdesignation, victim  of fascism.
 
>> Dora Klaym an:  Yes.  I gota passport. T he Swiss allowed m e tocom e.  I uncle, Josef  

Basch, he
 
cam e to theborder tom eet m e. Becausethere I was a young girl on theorient 
express by m yself .  He came to meet me. And that's thef irst tim ethat Ihad actually seen 

som ebody of m yf am ily when I was m ore than a 7
-
year
-
old.
 
 
So, I f ound m yself  f or f ir
st tim e in an Orthodox Jewish f am ily.  I had no idea.  I always 
knew who I was.  I knew I was Jewish.  Even thoughI had been christened at one pointduring 

the war, with tryin g to save m e. But I knew I was Jewish but I had no idea what thatm eant.  I 

d id
n'tpay m uch attention.  Under the Comm unist system  nobody wa s paying muchattention to 
religion of any kind.
 
 
But anywa y, I adoredm y uncle im mediately andm y aunt andm y cousins. So they 
invited m eto come back.  So when If inished m y f irst year at the University of Zagreb,I went 

back to Switzerland to study French in Lausanne.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And you were able to leaveagain?
 
>> Dora Klaym an:  Yes.  Once I wentoutand cam eback, it was ok.  I could go backagain.  

And I got the visa to go for a year to study.
 
 
And I think you want to hear whom Im et on the train.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You're readingm y m ind. I had to get that in.
 
>> Dora Klaym an:  Heknows that story.
 
 
So on the train there was some young people speaking English.  And I hadbeen an 
E n glis
h m ajor.  Ihad studied English all the way f rom  I thinkeighth grade through high school.  
I was an Englishm ajor at theuniversity.  Andso I was dying to hearwhat they were talking 

about. And they were talking about integration in the UnitedStatesan
d the problem s that 

som e young childrenhad to enter a white school.  And it was the time of all the efforts at Little 

Rock at integration. The governor standing at the door not allowing those children in.
 
 
So after thatdiscussion ended, I continued to speak with this young m an who was 
tryin g to defend the United States not def endwhat was happening but trying to explain that not 

ever ybody in the United States wouldact as the governor didand was very grateful that 

President Eisenhower had sent troops to
 
create abetter atmosphere.
 
SoI continued talking 
with him .  And we def initely liked each other.W eexchangedaddresses.
 

12
 
 
 
T henhe left to catch aship that was going back to the UnitedStates.  He was 
Am erican. And I wenton to Switzerland.  I very soon got lettersf rom him. And then I wrote 
back. And eventually, to m akethis long story short,he came back and we were m arried in 

Swit zerland.  And that's how I came to the United States.
 
>> Bill Benson:  I wanted you to tell that story.
 
 
I think we have
 
a couple of m inutesfor som equestionsf rom our audience. And I think 
we're going to start actually with thef irst question that comesf rom  the internet,I believe, if I'm  

correct about that. Then we'll turn to ouraudience.
 
 
T here's going tobe som e microphones in the aisle for you to use.
 
>> 
Goodm orning.  Mrs.
 
Hornicks class is watching in Iowa. T hey want to know at what age 
did you learn what really happenedand at what agedid you grasp what youand your fam ily 

had experienced?
 

>> Bill Benson:  It 
was hard
 
to hear you. Thequestion was, At whatage did you grasp what 
happened to yourf am ily and to you?
 
>> 
Yes.  At what age did really understand whathappenedto youand yourf amily?
 
>> Bill Benson:  At what agedid really understand what happened to
 
you and yourf am ily?
 
>> Dora Klaym an: I think I grasped what happened as soon asf reedom cam eand nobody 

returned. W hetherI internalized it, that's another story.  It was sort of
 
--
 
I remember, you know, 
thatpeople in the street used to askm ethis question.  People would stopm e in the streetand 

s a y,  
A
re you still hoping that your parents would return? I
 
--
 
it's amazing but I do remem ber 
people askingm ethatquestion. I would say," No, they're dead" .  Sort of  like
 
--
 
they would say, 
but m aybe they
 
are som eplace in Russia. I don't know wh y peoplehadthat sense. Because, 
of  course, there werem any people that hadbeen takento theSoviet Union at one point.And I 

understood that they were not com ing back. And I was trying to bevery brave about 
it .
 
>> Bill Benson:  Let's see if anybody in ouraudience hasa question.  If  you have a question, 

please wait f oram ic to behanded to you.  Make your questionsas brief as you can.  I'll repeat 

it so we all hear it.  And then Dora will respond.
 
 
I th in k
 
we have oneover here.  Thank you very m uch.
 
>> 
Hi.  Goodm orning. I just want to say thank you for sharing. And I appreciate it.  My nam e 
is Elan.  My question is a littleoff  topic.
 
 
Af terf irsthand seeing everything, all of  those atrocities,how do youfeel about what's 
going on in Syria today?  Do youfeel like that's a genocide in itself ?And do you think it's 

being handled correctly or do you thinkthe world is turning ablindeye to it?
 
>> Bill Benson:  Idon't know if  youheard thequestion. In
 
light of what's happening in the 
world, including places like Syria, your thoughts aboutthat.
 
 
I thinkone of the things that I'd liketo say f irst is that, of course, this is an institution 
that isdedicated to educating and comm itm ent to eradicating genocide so that's them ission of  

them useum  itself, and rem inding peopleforever that we hadthe Holocaust.
 
 
I don't know that you want to get into that particularly here but.
 
>> Dora Klaym an: I can just say that, yes, ittouches me very m uch, of  course.  It is im possible 

not to em pathize andnot to remember what happened to usand how not to think about people 

who are under such stress and strain, the peril of  their lives.
 
 
I thinkthere are sometim es
 
--
 
Idon't know why that picture of that little boy
 
--
 
I ' m  s u r e 
i t  wa s
 
--
 
it went viral, I think, the little boy sitting in a truck and just staring ahead. I thought, 
Oh,m y God,he looks like m y brother.  It's just im possiblenottofeelfor them . 
 
>> Bill Benson: T hank you, Dora. W ehave onem ore.
 

13
 
 
 
B ef o r e
 
we do that, I want to mention that wewi ll close theprogram . Dora will remain 
on the stage.  So please absolutelyf eelf reeto com euphere, meether, get your picture taken 
with her, or askher a question.  Andthat will be a goodtim e to gomaybe into
 
other topics.
 
 
One m ore question.
 
>> 
T hank you very m uchf or telling your story.  I don't know if I'll pronounce this correctly.  Do 
you know at all what happened to the Croatian Ustasa party af ter peace,af terthe Russians 

cam e in?
 

>> Bill Benson: T he question is
 
--
 
thank youfor asking that because I wanted to. W hat 
happened to Ustasa after the war? 
 

>> Dora Klaym an: There were trials. T herewere trials.  Andm any of  them were executed 

and jailed. Thereare still controversies aboutsom e of  whathappened.  T o what extent, you 

know
 
--
 
there were reprisals to what extentthere were reprisals thatwere not exactly done in a 
totally judicial manner. ButI rem em ber therebeing trials and I remem ber reading about what 

happened.
 
 
And,of  course, som eof the Ustasa tried to escape. T here is a still disputed tim e 
about an area of whathappened where apparently partisans killed som e ofthe escaping 

Ustasa. It hasn't been exactly decided whether that was done ina correct manner or not.So 

I'd rather not comm ent toom uch about that.
 
>> Bill Benson: T hank you, Dora.
 
 
I want to thank all of you for being here.  I remind that you we have the
 
F i rs t  P e rson
 
program  eachW ednesday andThursday through the m iddleof  August.
 
 
Bef ore you get up, I'm  going to turnback
 
to Dora.  It's our tradition at
 
F i rs t  P e rso n
 
th at 
our First Person has the last word.  So Dorawi ll say a f ew m ore com ments.
 
W hen Dora 
f inishes,our photographer, Joel, will com e upon the stage and take a video of Dora with you 

as the background.  So, please, if  you can stay seatedf or another couple of m om entsonce 

Dora has f inished.
 
 
And,again, Dora will r em ain on the stage.  So if  you'd like to com eup here andask 
her a questionbecause you didn't have a chancetoor just say hi to her,pleasefeel f ree to do 

th a t.
 
>> Dora Klaym an: So, just because I knew that I wouldbe given this m om ent,I gatheredmy 

thoughts yesterday and wrote down what I wanted to say.  Sof orgive mef or reading it.
 
 
W eare here inthemost appropriate place, Ithink, to stop 
and think what happens 
when people yield topolitical expedience to dem onizing those who seem different, to using 

hurtf ul language that can easily lead topainful consequences.W e are livin g now in a diff icult 

world.  T here are, again, peoplef leeing war and persecution,people who have nowhere togo.  

T here are, again, some who out of fear would closethe door and let 
t h em  
p
erish. But here we 
are gathered to rem ember those who lost their li ves through prejudice and hatred and to honor 

those who of ten at their own peril sheltered others and that gives m e hope.  It helpsm eto 

continue believing thatunderstanding tolerance and com passion can and will pre vail.
 
 
T hank youfor being here with m e.
