The life stor ies  of Holoc aus t
 
s urvivor s  trans c end the dec ades . What you are about to hear 
fr om  Steve is  one individual's  ac c ount of the Holoc aus t. We have pr epared a brief s lide pr es entation to 

help with his  introduc tion.
 
 
We begin with a studio por trait taken in 1940 or  1941 of Steve
 
and his s is ter
, 
Es ter a. Steve 
was  born J une 6, 1931 in Subotic a, Yugos lavia. The arrow on this map of Yugos lavia in 1933 points  to 

Subotic a.

Steve's  father, Louis, was  the m anager  of the printing plant of a Hungarian language daily 
news paper  and would later bec ome the editor of that s ame news paper. His  mother, Clair e, was  a 
graphic  artis t. In this  photo we s ee Louis and Clair e at a hors e r ace in Subotic a in the 1920s.
 
 
In this  photo we s ee Steve and his  fam ily on an outing to a farm in the s umm er of 1940.
 
In 
1941 Germ any attack ed Yugos lavia and its  ally, Hungary, oc c upied Steve's  town. Life c hanged 
imm ediately for Steve and his  fam ily. J ews  in Subotic a wer e s ubjec ted to Hungarian r ac ial laws , whic h 

were modeled after those in Germ any. From  Septem ber 1940 to May 1944, Steve's fam ily lived in one 
c or ner of their apartm ent.
 
 
In May 1944, Ger m any occ upied Hungar y
 
and Hungarian
-
oc c upied territor ies  like Subotic a. 
Soon after Steve's  father was  depor ted to Aus c hwitz
 
while the r est of the fam ily was  for c ed into a 
g
hetto in Subotic a. At the end of J une 1944, Steve and his  fam ily that r emained in the ghetto were s ent 
to another ghetto and s ent then to Aus c hwitz. Here we s ee an aerial rec onnais s anc e photo of 

Aus c hwitz Birkenau taken in September 1944 by the US Air For ce. The arrow points  to the barr ack  that 
Steve was  in from J une thr ough Oc tober 1944.
 
 
In Oc tober 1944, Steve was  s ent to another  c amp at Nieder or s c hel. On Apr il 1, 1945, about 
s ix m onths  later
,  
Steve was  s ent on a death m ar ch to the Buc henwald c onc entr ation c am p.                              
Steve was  liber ated by the Amer ic ans  on April 11. He was  then plac ed in a field hospital establis hed at 

Buc henwald, we s ee that field hos pital in this  photo
. 
 
 
Four months later  Steve r etur ned to Subotic a and was  reunited with his  father  and s is ter , but 
his  father  died les s  than s ix m onths  after returning to Subotic a. Steve's mother per is hed at Aus c hwitz. 

Steve and his  sister im migrated to the US in 1950.
 
 
Af
ter arriving in the U.S. in 1950, Steve was  drafted into the United States Ar my in 1952.  After 
his  dis c harge he enr olled at the Champaign
-
Ur bana c am pus  of the Univer s ity of Illinois  wher e he would 
eventually ear n his  Ph.D. in c ivil engineer ing and begin a
 
42
-
year  ac ademic  c ar eer in the c om puting 
field at the Univer s ity of Illinois  and later at Carnegie Mellon Univer s ity in Pitts burgh. After  r etir ing fr om 

Car negie Mellon in 1999, Steve and his wife, Norm a, whom  he married in 1955, m oved to the 
Washington, D.C. ar ea where he worked for  10 year s  at the National Institute of Standards and 
Tec hnology.
 
 
Steve and Norm a have four  c hildren. Gr egor y is  Pr es ident of the Univers ity of Texas  at Austin. 
Car ol is  Spec ial As s is tant to the New York City Comm is s ioner of the
 
Department of Des ign and 
Cons truction. Peter is  a pr ofes s or of literature at Nor thwes tern Univers ity
. A
nd their  younges t, Laur a, is  
a hum an r es our c es c onsultant here in the Was hington, D.C. area.  Steve and Norm a have s even 

grandc hildr en between the ages  of 8 and 30. Norm a is her e today with Steve.
 
 
Steve firs t began s peaking about his  Holoc aus t experienc e in the late 1970s  when he bec ame 
the founding pres ident of a Holoc aus t s urvivor s ' or ganization in Pitts burgh.  Upon his s ec ond retir em ent 

from the Natio
nal Institute of Standards  and Tec hnology in Dec ember  2009, Steve bec ame ac tive with 
this  mus eum.  In addition to partic ipating in the 
Firs t Pers on
 
progr am, he als o volunteer s  with the 
m us eum's Vis itor Ser vic es  on Thurs days .
 
 
In 2014 Steve publis hed "The Life and Art of Klara Gereb: 1897 
-  
1944," a book about his 
m other , a graphic  ar tis t who peris hed in Aus c hwitz, and her  work that was  res c ued by her form er cook 

dur ing the deportations. Steve's  gr anddaughter, Hannah, a graphic  ar tist her s elf, was  the des ign
er of 
the book . Copies of the books are available from Am azon.
 
 
With that I would like you to join me in welc om ing our Fir st Per s on, Steve Fenves .

[Applaus e]
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Steve, thank  you s o m uch for  joining us and for  being willing to be our
 
First 
Per s on
 
today. We have a large c r owd and you have a huge am ount to tell us  in a ver y s hort period of time.  So 

we'll start.
 
 
You wer e nearly 10 year s  old when the part of Yugos lavia, where you were living, was  
oc c upied by Hungary and your  family's  life would be forever c hanged.  Befor e we turn to that time, let's 

begin with you telling us  a little bit about your fam ily, your  c omm unity, and your s elf in thos e years  

before the oc c upation, befor e the war.

> > Steven Fenves :  All r ight. Well, before that
 
--
 
I po
int this  out every time I s peak  her e.  I taught for 42 
year s .  I never  had us hers  who us hered people to the fr ont r ows s o m y s tudents  always  s at in the bac k  
r ows .  This  is quite a c hange for me.
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
> > Steven Fenves :  All r ight. We lived in thi
s  town
 
--
 
Yugos lavia as  a country was  only 12 years  older 
than I was .  It was  only founded after World War I.  And befor e that it was  par t of Hungary, third largest, 
Hungary.  Very large agric ultur al c enter bec ame a border  town.  It was  nev er as lively as  what m y 
par ents talked about fr om befor e the war
, 
100,000 people
, 
J ewis h population of about 6,000, 4,000 
belonging to the progr ess ive c ongregation, 2,000 belonging to a num ber of small Orthodox 

c ongregations.
 
 
We wer e not partic ularly religious  but 
m y 
par
ents  attended high holiday festivals , 
anniversar ies , etc . We, m y s is ter and I and three c ous ins , attended r eligious  s c hools  thr ee afternoons  

a week
 a
nd then youth servic e on Satur day m or nings.  Regular sc hool went until noon on Saturday s o 
the c ommunity organized a religious  sc hool for  children in the after noon whic h had to end prom ptly at 

2:00
 
bec ause that was  the tim e when the thr ee movie hous es  in the c ity opened the matinees  and, of 
c our se, everybody r an out of the small c hapel as fas t as  they c ould.
 
 
The fact that in s c hool we s tudied in Serbian and at hom e we s poke Hungarian was  a norm al 
thing to do.  That never  bothered me, bother ed us.  It was  s tr ange when my c hildren s tarted s c hool and 
they s poke the s ame language in s c hool as we did at hom e.  For a while that bothered m e.
 
 
So we had a ver y pleas ant, upper middle clas s life.
 
There was  talk  about the war.  There wer e 
people c oming in as  refugees, fr om Poland
,  
but nobody was  r eally prepared for  what happened and it 
c am e all of a s udden.
 
> > Bill B ens on
:  Steve, befor e we tur n to thos e year s , tell us a little bit about your father.
 
> > Steven Fenves :  My father was  the younger brother.  His  older br other bec am e inter ested in 
liter ature in high sc hool.  His  c las s mate was  later known as  the gr eates t Hungari
an wr iter  of the fir st 
quar ter of the c entur y s o they together founded a s c hool news paper, etc . 
 
 
When m y unc le graduated fr om high s c hool, he imm ediately went to Budapes t
, 
ostens ibly to 
s tudy law.  He s pent mos t of his time as a jour nalis t.  Reports  ar e that he never graduated.  Ever ybody 
c alled him  Dr.
 
Fenves  but appar ently he never got his  law degr ee.  And he c ame back and started a 
news paper with a ver y s izeable dowry
, w
hen he m arr ied my aunt
; 
he bought the paper .  As s oon as my 
father gr aduated fr om hi
gh s c hool, he went to Croatia and worked to s uppor t his  brother.  As s oon as  
they c ould affor d it, he came back  as the manager of the plant.
 
 
So my father was  very inter ested in all of the ac tivities  of the news paper .  He was  very m uc h 
interes ted in his  people.  For s om e r eas on that I don't understand, a num ber  of retirees opened up little 
wine and beer s hops with s om e food on the s ide.  I rem em ber going there for tas ting every one of 
them
,  
acc om panied m y father.  And par tic ular ly Orthodox employ
ee
s  had t
hes e fantastic  feas ts.  We 
always  went to thos e.
 
So we felt ver y c los e to the people.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  How about your  m other , Steve?  She was  a ver y talented artis t.
 
> > Steven Fenves :  My m other  was  a well
-
known artis t.  The loc al m us eum keeps  advertis ing her  as 
the fir s t univers ity
-
tr ained gr aphic  artist in town.  She did a lot of tr aveling after  s c hool.  The fam ily lor e 
is  that the two of them met when s he started doing commerc ial work for the paper, etc ., inc luding the 
r edes ign of the banner.
 
She was  not
 
as ac tive as we s tarted growing up for the s imple r eas on that the 
two of us outgrew the s o
-
c alled nur s er y and barged into the s o
-
c alled studio.  So that s ort of c ur tailed 
her  activities .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  I c an't help but ask  you to talk  about this .  You m
entioned to m e that Wednes day 
after noons  was a tim e off for m aids and gover ness es , when they all took  som e tim e off
, 
and that with 
your  s even c ousins  
you 
would do ter rible things.
 
> > Steven Fenves :  Seven c ous ins  in town, one in Budapes t who oc c as ionally cam e to vis it and then 

we wer e eight.  I was  the younges t of the eight.  It took  year s  in sc hool befor e I r ealized that m y nam e 
was  Fenves  and not what m eans  the little [Indis c er nible].  I thought that was  m y name.
 

4 
 
 
So we wer e on our  own.  Whatever  the older guys  did, guys  and gals  did, I followed.  So one 
inc ident that I had m entioned previous ly, in the ec onomy with abs olutely no r efr igeration, no 
r efr igerators , etc., you s ubs is t during the winter on what you have c anned and pr es er ved during the 
summer.  We
ll, one day we br oke into m y gr andmother 's pantr y, s oak ed off the labels  of ever y jar and 
c an in the pantr y, and r ehung them on other s.
 
>> 
[Laughter]
 
> > Bill Bens on:  As you said a minute ago, thos e early year s  wer e pretty good years  for  you.
 
> > Steven Fen
ves :  Yeah.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  In 1941, Ger m any invaded Yugos lavia and their ally, Hungary, oc c upied your  part of 
Yugoslavia, where you lived.  Fr om  the ver y fir s t day of their oc c upation, your fam ily and your 
c om m unity were imm ediately s ubjec ted to pr ofound
 
upheaval. What happened to your fam ily onc e the 
Hungar ians arr ived? 
 
> > Steven Fenves :  The s ec ond day of what the Hungar ians r efer to as liber ation, whic h we r efer to as 
oc c upation, an Arm y offic er expelled my father at gun point from his  offic e.  As  of
 
about a month ago, I 
now have a c opy of the or der of the c omm anding gener al of the ces s ation of the news paper.  My father 

and m y aunt were thrown out.  Well, not just that they wer e thrown out, the plant was  tak en over by an 
Ar yan adm inis tr ator who made it public ly k nown that he intended to popular ize the family and did som e 
nic e things  like clos ing ac c es s  to the bank , to the pers onal ac c ounts  of m y father  and my aunt, at the 

s am e time c harging the entire payr oll of the plant to that per s onal ac c ount
 a
nd a
 
few other  things like 
that.
 
 
So that's how things went. We lived for the following thr ee years  on what pos s es s ions  we 
c ould s ell, inc luding my stam p c ollec tion that I was  ver y proud of.  Eventually 2/3 of the apar tment was  

c eded through Arm y officer s .
 
>>
 
Bill Benson:  You ha
d 
to have Hungar ian offic er s  live in your  hous e with you?
 
> > Steven Fenves :  Yes .  Ther e was  no m or e nurs ery, no mor e studio.  It was  all ceded to the officers.
 
And thr ee year s  of incr eas ingly s evere and res tr ic tive and humiliating r eg
ulations .  Every other month 
s om ething had to be turned in, radios , etc., but eventually it was  c loc ks, alarm c locks , and s tuff like that
, 
l
ong lines  standing outs ide, people coming by and s pitting at you.  It didn't m ake any s ens e.  Kids  had a 
r affle goin
g to gues s what was  going to be the next c onfis c ation in the next m onth.
 
> > Bill Bens on: What happened to your  educ ations ? 
 
> > Steven Fenves :  Oh, yeah.  That s peec h of yours  needs to be c orrec ted.  The Hungar ian 

exc lus ionary law c alled Num er us Claus us  was  copied by the Germans.  It was  prom ulgated in Hungar y 
pr oper s tar ted in 1923, the propor tion of J ewis h s tudents and ac ademic ins titutions to the s ame 

pr oportion as  in the general population, whic h was  about 6%
, 
Numerus Claus us .
 
 
Ac ademic  educ ation, of c o
urs e that's els ewhere in Europe, started the fifth gr ade.  That was  
the fir s t year.  So that fir st summ er of oc c upation I had to study ver y har d to take this r uthles s  exam that 
was  des igned to kill you.  Eventually I was  one of the few exc epted in.  The J ewis h c omm unity s et up a 
pr ivate s c hool for  the other s .
 
It didn't m atter  m uc h bec aus e you s at in the bac k  of the c las s, totally 
ignor ed by the teac her s .  Rais ing your hand you learned was  not wor th it bec aus e nobody ever  c alled 
on you.  So it was  a very hard period.
 
 
My m other, a very good graphic  artist
 
--
 a
ctually, her  degree was  in indus tr ial des ign.  She s et 
up s hop.  Half a dozen of her r elatives  wer e knitting, cr oc heting, weaving, all kinds  of things .  And then 
that was  s hipped to Budapes t wher e her c ous ins  c ould sell them  at a m uch better pric e than we c ould 
in the small town.  So her handy c r afts  r eally helped us  s ur vive.
 
> > Bill Bens on: Was your s ister able to c ontinue her educ ation?
 
> > Steven Fenves :  She went
 
--
 
ther e wer e s everal Catholic  or ders ,
 
s ome nuns , and a teac hing or der  
who did not honor the s tate law and ac c epted J ewis h students .  She went to a s c hool r un by a c onvent.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And as you told us
, your father was  forc ed at gunpoint to leave his offic e.  The 
news paper  was  taken awa y fr om him. There would s ubs equently be a tr ial as s oc iated.
 
> > Steven Fenves :  Yeah.  All of this  had to be legalized, of c ours e.  In 1943 there was  a tr ial to make 

this  legal.  One inc ident I r em em ber  r eading about, I don't remember, is  the ac c us ation was
 
m ade that 

5 
 
it was  an anti
-
Chris tian ac t that they m ade the workmen wor k  on Sunday after noons  to br ing out the 
Monday paper .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  They s aid your father m ade them do that.
 
> > Steven Fenves :  Well, m y aunt was  the manager  by that tim e, m y father  t
he editor.  Of c ours e, the 
defens e statem ent that ever y other paper ever ywhere els e in the world has  a Monday edition whic h is  

for us e on Sunday the judge ruled irr elevant to this  cas e.  So that's  the kind of tr eatm ent you got under 

law.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And you would, as  you s aid, live under  thos e conditions  until 1944.  And then in the 

s pr ing of 1944, with Hungary about to c apitulate to the allies , Germany moved quickly to oc c upy 
Hungary and the ar eas it oc c upied, inc luding your town.  Conditions for  your
 
fam ily quickly turned far  
wors e than under  the Hungar ians  as your father was  taken and your m other, s is ter and you were for c ed 
into a ghetto.
 
Tell us what happened 
to 
you and the r est of your family.
 
> > Steven Fenves :  My father, all the doctors, lawyer s ,
 
J ewis h intelligenc e in town, was  taken away in 
one night as the Nazis  did every wher e
, h
ous ed for  a few weeks  in a brickyar d nearby and then s hipped 
to Aus c hwitz.  He eventually wound up wor king in a c oal mine in Siles ia and eventually was  liber ated.  

His  
m em oir s  s ay he was  am ong 30 living out of a c amp of 7,000.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  At the time, did you have any idea where he went?
 

> > Steven Fenves :  No.  Nobody ever  knew.  The bigges t s urpris e, a year later after my s is ter and I 

went bac k , is that he c am e back  on a Soviet Army military train.
 
> > Bill Bens on: We'll talk  maybe a little bit mor e about that later.
 
 
Steve, you s har ed with me that it was n't Germ ans  that
 
--
 
> > Steven Fenves :  Oh, yes .  I did not s ee a Germ an s oldier until the ar rival in Aus c hwitz.  Ever ything 

was  done by the Hungar ian s tate polic e.  They had long ago planned all of that.  Many year s  later 

Nor ma and I were in the Holoc aus t m us eum in Budapes t and the entranc e r oom is  plas ter ed with 
 
facs im iles .  There was a fir s t page of one of the Budapes t papers des c r ibing the deportation a
nd the 
or ders of the c omm anding offic er of everybody will be s hot if anything happens , etc .  I mean, I k new 
that everybody knew about it but I never knew that it was  fr ont page news .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And after  your  father was  deported, you and your fam ily wer e s ent to a ghetto.  You 
r em em ber the day that you were ac tually for c ed to leave your hom e and you des c r ibed it to m e as  one 
of your gr imm est m em ories .
 
> > Steven Fenves :  Yup. We were or dered to leave with whatever  pos s es s ions  we c ould c ar ry.  I don't 

know how the towns people were aler ted, inform ed, etc .  But we lived
 
--
 
the hallways , s tair s were lined 
with people waiting to ra
n
s ack the apar tment as s oon as  we left.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And thes e wer e neighbor s?
 
>
>  Steven Fenves :  Thes e wer e neighbor s .  Thes e were loc al people.  As we were leav ing, they wer e 
yelling, c urs ing, s pitting on us , m aking it diffic ult to navigate the s tairs  with c arr ying s om e baggage.  

That was  very tough.
 
 
Am ong thos e people was  a form er
 
c ook  whom
,  
of c our s e
, 
we had let go thr ee years  earlier  
bec aus e, A, we didn't have m oney, B, there was  a r ule that we c ouldn't have gentile em ployees .  She 

was  in that gr oup.  She snuc k  in, took  m y mother 's  c ookbook , and took  whatever art and paper s he 
co
uld find and s hoved it in a big folder and took it with her and after  the war r eturned to us. 
 
 
Thos e of you on this  floor  after this  talk , go to the "Some 
Wer e N
eighbor s" exhibit and you will 
s ee m y m other 's c ookbook .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You were for c ed into
 
the ghetto.  What wer e c onditions  lik e ther e?
 
> > Steven Fenves :  Mis er able.  Two or  m or e families  in a r oom, no s anitation, food distribution out in 

the c our t s om ehow.  It jus t was  total c haos.  I jus t r em em ber  us kids just running fr om  plac e to plac e 
and
 
all of the wild r um or s, anything fr om a revolt in town to they'r e c om ing to liberate us to whatever
, 
th
er e was  a tr ain waiting to take us  to Switzer land, ever y pos s ible rum or r unning around.  
 
 
Eventually we were lined up and the tr ains , 80 people to a bo

or what I estimate to have been five days  and s ix nights before we ar rived in Aus c hwitz.

you told m e that you r eceived a m os t welc om ed birthday gift on your  13th bir thday.
 
> > Steven Fenves :  I was  allowed out bec aus e

I worked in the m ac hine s hop of a former em pl
oyee 
and I was out of the ghetto on my birthday, J une
 
6, 1944.  Ther e we had a clandes tine, later to be BBC 
Europe, and that's  how we found out that the Norm andy invas ion s tarted.  That evening when I went 
bac k  to the ghetto, I s uspec t that I was  the first
 
per s on who notified people ins ide the ghetto that that 
had happened.  I don't have any doc um entation on that.  But ver y few people went outs ide the ghetto.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So, Steve, they r ounded you up, depor ted you in the boxc ars to Aus c hwitz.  Did you
 

know wher e you wer e going?
 
> > Steven Fenves :  Nope.  Abs olutely not.  I don't know when the name cam e up.  It c ertainly was  not a 

s tandard r ailr oad s ign with the nam e on it.  It
 
was  a horr endous  experienc e.  
 
 S
om e of you may have seen the film "Sc hindler's  List" and may have s een
 
--
 
may remember 
the s c ene where by mistake the kids  fr om the labor c am p are s ent to Aus chwitz.  Ther e's  a nic e
, gently 

s loping ramp and ver y ginger ly and s edately they walk down the r amp. Well, there was  no ram p.  
There was  a r ailr oad c ar .  At m y age, the height of m y c hin.  You either jumped or you wer e thr own out.  
Guar ds as well as  inm ates  detailed to
 
empty the trains  wer e
 
glad to throw you out if you hes itated in 
jum ping.
 
Men were s epar ated fr om women.  My gr andm other, who had a pros thetic  leg whic h got los t 
s om ewhere, was  s itting on a bunc h of s uitc as es .  My m other  and s is ter went one way and I went the 

other way.  That's the last time I s aw m y m other.
 
 
A lot of Aus c hwitz s ur viv or s  will tell you that they wer e s elec ted by a SS doc tor, Dr .
 
Mengele
, 
who did the s elec tions.  I was  not intr oduc ed to the gentleman s o I don't know his  nam e.  It was  jus t 
an 
offic er with ins ignia of SS C
aptain and white gloves  and he pointed r ight and left
, w
hic h none of us 
knew what it m eant.  It too
k 24 hour s  to find out.
 
> > Bill Bens on: Where did your  s is ter go?
 
> > Steven Fenves :  My s is ter  and m other  went to the right in their line but they wer e s eparated r ight 
away s o they were not together.
 
 
So that's how I got to Aus c hwitz.  Aus c hwitz is  known as  an exterm ination c amp, 1.6
 
m illion 
people died there, but it had a s econd func tion.  It was  an enor mous 
s
tock
y
ar d, you s aw from  the 
photogr aph, where people wer e warehous ed to be selec ted to go out to labor , to the kind of labor that 
you s aw in the s lides .  The only pr oblem  was  in a barrack with about 1,000 kids  my age, no German 
foreman, no Germ an offic er  looking for labor ever s topped to s elec t.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  1,000 kids .
 
> > Steven Fenves :  1,000 kids .  So you lear ned quic kly
 
--
 
you lear ned a lot in very s hort or der what the 
other line m eant, what the s tenc h meant, what the ashes  falling down on you meant.  You learned 
to
 
--
 
until you c ould s crounge to get your s elf a c up, you learned to take your  daily m eal of s oup in your 
hands .  On your onc e
- a-
day r un to the latrine, you lear ned to pick  up a sm ooth pebble on the r oad to 
have s om ething to wipe
 
your s elf
 
s inc e unfortunately they did not provide toilet paper .  You learned the 
s tenc h of your own body after months of not was hing, of not c hanging c lothes  or under wear .  Those ar e 
the kinds of things you lear ned.
 
 
In this  barr ack
 
--
 
m any of you have s een m ovies , c r iminal movies
,  
and you know that in a 
c r im inal es tablis hment you fear  two kinds of people, the
 
guar ds  on the inside and the dec is ion m akers 
on the ins ide who ar e inm ates in c ontrol.  In Ausc hwitz, in all the Germ an c amps , this  was  organized, 

as  everything was  organized.  The overs eer s , c alled kapos , wer e German c om mon crim inals brought 
out from pri
s ons  to s erve as overs eers .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So m urder er s, rapis ts, people like that.
 
> > Steven Fenves :  Whatever.  Whatever.  They only had one problem.  They s poke only German and 

the m ajority of the kids  or  inm ates in Aus chwitz at that time s poke Hungar
ian.
 
 
One thing about m y c hildhood educ ation that I didn't m ention is  that in m y par ents' s oc ial 
s etting it was abs olutely im per ative that m y s is ter and I lear n perfec t high Germ an r ather  than the c rude 
s poken on the s tr eets.  We had a German gover nes s .  
Any m emory I have, the governes s is  already in 
it.  
 

7 
 
 
So I volunteered as an interpreter.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  At age 14, r ight?
 
> > Steven Fenves :  13.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  An interpr eter .
 
>>
 
Steven Fenves :  I was  an interpreter.  I bec ame an interpreter.  The rewar ds  were minim al.  One 
r eward was  that after the tr oops  were fed fr om the barrels , you c ould go, the two inter pr eter s  c ould go, 
in with a s poon and s c r ape out the bottom of these bar
r els .  
 
 
But you lear ned a lot about their  m akeup of the c amp, etc. You als o learned that people die 
before their body gives  out.  That under thes e c onditions  of depr ivation, star vation, and hopeles s ness  
the m ind and s pir it dies befor e the body.  Thes e people are s huffling around, not s eeing wher e they 
were going, totally oblivious .  Eventually at night they wer e c ar ted out together with the dead and s ent 

dir ec tly to the crem ator ium , no point in was ting gas  on gass ing them.  They were already dead.
 
Unfortun
ately thes e barrac k  boys  were doing that.  One by one, ever y one of m y c las smates with whom  

I was  together died in that fas hion
, I
'm told from people who wer e with her when my mother died.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You wer e able to loc ate your s is ter s om ehow.
 
>> St
even Fenves :  Yeah.  That c am e later .
 
 
People as k  m e about my feelings .  I m ean, during that per iod I had no expec tation whats oever 
of you will be
 
luckier than them and s urviving.  
 
 
The big event was  in August, ver y well doc umented in the Aus c hwitz liter atur e, a quarter of 
this  c om pound
 
--
 
the entire c om pound was  c alled the gyps y c ompound becaus e a quarter  of them  was 
oc c upied by gyps y fam ilies , wom en, c hildr en, older  m en, no working
-
aged m en.  They wer e 
exter minated in one night. We were locked in.  And when the barr ack  gates  wer e opened, we s aw 

inm ates c leaning out the bar racks, whitewas hing them , etc., and we s aw a new s et of order lies , a new 

s et of s uper vis or s , but ins tead of the gr een tr iangle of the c rim inals , they had r ed tr iangles of politic al 
pr is
oner s .
 
One of them cam e over  and asked for  a Polis h
-
German
-
Hungarian inter pr eter.  I had never 
hear d a word of Polis h in my life.  All I knew was  that it was  a Slavic  language and, ther efore, I dec ided 

it c ouldn't be m uc h different fr om Ser bian and I volun
teer ed.
 
That's the point that changed my life.  
Bec aus e these people
 
--
 
fir s t of all, they were willing to tr ain m e in Polis h bec aus e the pres umption that 
it was  eas y was  not that ac c ur ate.
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
> > Steven Fenves :  But thes e people were res isting and ins is ted that anyone who wor ked for  them als o 

r es is t in whatever  fas hion they c ould.  And they certainly expec ted that anybody wor king for  them would 
expec t to be able to s urvive through his ac tions and thr ough his  r es is tanc e.  So the idea of s urvival,
 
the 
idea of per haps getting out of that is  not
 
--
 
I didn't make it up.  It was  jus t hamm ered into my head by 
thes e Polis h.
 
 
So lots  of things  happened.  I was  an interpreter.  We had the troops lined up for  ins pection 
when they c ame.  For reas ons  that I never  unders tood, every ins pec tion was  in the nude. When m y 

s is ter was  s elec ted to work in a light bulb factor y threading filam ents , the ins pec tion was  am ong 400 

nude women.  Why that s kill r equires  nudity, I never under s tood.  Anyhow, people were lined up
 
nude, 
waiting for the ins pec tor s.  When the tr affic  was  too heavy, thos e of us  who wer e interpr eter s  wer e sent 

to the SS s tation in front of the c amp, es c or ted the people doing the trans lation while they were 
interviewing the people.  Quickly learned thr o
ugh r
es pons es, when they looked for  car penters, any 
r es pons e anybody
 
gave was tr ans lated as  exper t c
ar penter  to the Ger man.  So that was  one of our 
duties .
 
 
The other duty the group had was
 
it had 
repair
 
detail.  I
n 
the exhibition, you s ee one of the 
bar ra
cks fr om  Aus c hwitz but you don't s ee the dilapidated c ondition and the torn r oofs.  Even the SS 

agr eed with the winter  c oming, s ome r epair needed to be done.  So we were given a c art pulled by two 
people c ontaining a barrel of pitc h and s ome r ows  of r oofing paper and we went from c om pound to 
c om pound fixing roofs.
 
 
Very frequently we went to wom en's c om pounds  for  the s imple r eas on that Polis h c ouples that 
s or t of r otated on this  detail had their girlfr iends
 
--
 
female c ouples , fem ale compounds .  So vis iting 
was  

8 
 
par t of it.  Black  m arketing was  another part of it.  It's  r eally am azing to think  how eas y it was  to bribe 
s oldier s , even non
-
c omm is s ioned SS offic ers .
 
> > Bill Bens on: Was it while you wer e doing the roofing that you were able to loc ate your  s is ter?
 
> > Steven Fenves :  Yes , in one of the compounds  I loc ated my s is ter.  She was  on her way out to a 
tr ans port.  I c as hed in all my black market goods  and got her a sc arf and sweater to
 
get out of ther e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And s he left.
 
> > Steven Fenves :  She l
eft.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Did you know wher e s he was  s ent?  No.
 
 
Steve, we c ould s pend the entir e after noon with you jus t c overing the five m onths  that you 
s pent in Ausc hwitz and we s till wouldn't do it jus tic e.  But in a truly as tounding way, you left Auschwi
tz 
in October
 
1944.  Tell us how that was  pos s ible and what happened.
 
> > Steven Fenves :  Again, the Polis h kapos sm uggled m e out.  Ther e's  no other  word for  it.  They 

dec ide
d on a
 
tr ans port that looked r eas onably s afe, they s hoved m e in the line and I got 
out.
 
 
And another 
--
 
just to c over  quickly befor e your ques tions , another train ride arriving to the 
s m all town in eas ter n Ger m any c alled Nieder or schel and we wer e as s igned to a fac tory produc ing 
wings  for air planes .  Lest
 
you
 
think that we are guilty of c ollaborating with the enemy, let me tell you 
that no wing produc ed by that factory ever flew.
 
>> 
[Laughter] 
 
> > Steven Fenves :  There was  enough s hortage of piec es, enough s abotage, enough dis ruption of the 
r ailroad lines, etc., s o nothing ever happened.
 
>
>  Bill Bens on:  Befor e you go on, I do want you to tell us that when you left Aus c hwitz, when you got 
to, I believe, Niederors c hel, her e you ar e a 13
-
year
-
old kid who jus t left Ausc hwitz, you wer en't warmly 
greeted.
 
> > Steven Fenves :  By the inm ates .  Warmly greeted by the for eman who r ec ognized m e as  having 
tr ans lated for  him  in Ausc hwitz but s aying, "Why are you here?  I did not selec t you."  To whic h I 
imm ediately c oined the answer , 
ﬁW
ell, they thought with this  m any new people you needed another 
tr ans la
tor.
ﬂ
  
He acc epted that.  But the inmates did not.  A For man knew me.  My c lothes  wer e better 
quality than the other  inm ates.  It all s ounded ver y s trange.  So it was  a very long interrogation in 

Germ an, Hungar ian, Russ ian, Czec h, whatever  els e befor e I was  ac c epted by the leaders hip by the 
r es is tanc e organization.  And fr om then on I was  par t of that organization as  well.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And as you were telling us , you were s uppos ed to be making wings but no planes flew 

fr om  ther e.  You als o were c over tly
 
m aking weapons , if I rem em ber c orrectly.
 
> > Steven Fenves :  Ever ything was punis hable by death, as  always .  We were c ons tantly
 
--
 
whatever  
c ould be stolen fr om the factor y was  s tolen.  The word s tealing did not appear  in the inm ate voc abulary.  

It was  always  liber ated.  We liber ated what we c ould
, a
lum inum, tools , whatever.
 
 
After 14

hour workday, the s o
-
c alled c ommons  in the barr acks became alive with people 
doing everything, shoemaker s , tailor s wor king with thread and needle barter ed
 
with black market 
goods
, c
arving, marvelous  alum inum boxes .  Mos t ever ybody making weapons .  I had my own knife 
whic h pr obably would be c alled a stiletto.  Night after night, week  after week , c ar ved with s tone until it 

was  pr oper ly s haped.

others who had been ther e, the fir st thing I looked for  was  the c him ney of the c r emator ium.  It was n't

1947 but the Ir on Cur tain was  there in 1945.  The fir s t day of liber ation

the fir st thr ee days  of the 
liberation, the Fr enc h, the Belgians , the Nor wegians , the Greeks , the Spaniar d wer e all out.  Thos e of 

us  who wanted to go to the other  s ide waited m onths .  So it was n't until mid

July that I got home.  A 
week later
 
--
 
I m is s ed m y s is ter c om ing home.  It was  a well

m eaning farmer fam ily dec ided to take me 
in to fatten m e up.  A r esult of that was  jaundic e bec aus e the liver was  s o overloaded.  So I was n't there 

when s he c am e back.  As  I s aid, a m onth later our  father  was  carried in by a loc al fireman, getting bac k  
that he was  threatened that he would be tr ied for c ollabor ation with the enemy bec aus e he did not put 
up arm ed r e
sistance. 
> > Bill Bens on:  That was  the thr eat if he tried to get back  his  bus ines s .
 
> > Steven Fenves :  Right.  So s lowly we built things up and then he pas s ed away.  At leas t we c ould 
give him  a decent bur ial, next to his brother.  His  nam e, my mother 's name, and all the other people 
who per is hed by this  ver y

So then dec ided life in Yugos lavia was  not wor th it.  Our two c ous ins , their two

l
ook a little bit m ore intelligent than that.  What else can you do?  I s aid, well, s ir, I als o pas s ed m y

Army

Hi.  I was  wondering if the Polis h couple you talked about and the other c ouples that you talked 
about that helped you get out of the plac es, did
 
you
 
keep in c ontact with them?  Did you talk to them?  
Do you know who they are? 
 
> > Bill B ens on:  Do 
you 
keep in touc h with anybody who helped you
? 
> > Steven Fenves :  No one, abs olutely no one.  I m ade a c ouple attempts  with the Aus c hwitz m us eum  
r un by the Polis h government.  I r emem bered s om e verbal name in Polish.  I c ould never  produc e a 

nam e on whic h they c ould do a s earc h.  The s ame for  ever ybody els e.
 
 
The little c am p in Nieder
o
r s c hel was  a little bit better .  I didn't make any per s onal c ontac ts but 
a per s on there organized a sm all loc al m useum, has  inter viewed every s urvivor that he c an and he has  
a book out c onsis ting of interviews  of the people.  So I k now a little bit about s om e of thos e people.  But 
otherwis e, no.
 
The em ptying of the c amp in Buc henwald, ther e was  no way of m aintaining any c ontac t.
 
>> 
Thank you.
 
> > Bill Bens on: We have tim e for one m or e quick  ques tion.

Hi, Steve.  I was  just wondering how you pos s ibly forgive and move on.  Is  it a dec is ion that you 
m ade?  Does  it help talking about your  experienc es  and s har ing thos e with people? 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  The ques tion is , Steve, how you wer e able to get to a position wher e you wanted to live 
and continue on.  Let m e look  her e.  Yes.  I think  I've got that.  Ok.  And does  it help for  you to talk  and 
do what you'r e doing today? 
 

> > Steven Fenves :  Once I made this tr ans ition from  being c los e to the living dead to a pur pos e and 
expec tation, after  that trans ition I was  determined that I would s urvive, determ ined that I would help 
other people s ur vive and that bec am e ver y eas y.
 
 
To the point
 
--
 
and then all kinds  of things , moving to Franc e, learning Fr enc h, pass ing tha
t 
inc r edible Frenc h 
bac c alaur eate 
exam  that I don't wis h on anybody els e, c oming to the states, learning 
Englis h, Ar my s er vic e, college, mar riage, c hildren, etc .
, t
o the point that if I thought about it at all, I 
thought in the thir d pers on, as if that had
 
happened to s omeone els e.  And then it was  only in the early 
`
70s  when I had s om e problem s  at work and I thought that it would be helpful
 
--
 
I thought that ther e 
m ay have been s ome c onnec tion between that and what I had experienced in the c am ps .  That's  w
her e 
I forced mys elf to talk
; f
irs t of all, to an adult education c las s  in our tem ple, as Nor ma s aid, hiding 
behind a heavys et per s on.  That's  wher e s he hear d the story the fir s t tim e.  The r abbi ask ed m e to 
r epeat it to the youth group, 
m y 
older  kids wer e
 
ther e.  That's the firs t time they hear d the whole s tory.  
And fr om then on I went to this  m eeting where s om e horr ible c las hes oc c urr ed and the only s olution 

was  to volunteer to be the founding pr es ident and then other things  happened.  So from  then on it
 
was  
very norm al.  But in ter ms  of any c athar s is , any expec tation of additional ins ide gain, no, definitely not.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Thank  you, Steve.  Thank  you.
 
 
When Steve finis hes
 
--
 
we'r e going to c los e the progr am in a m oment.  I know there's a 
gentlema
n who didn't get a c hanc e to ask  a ques tion.  When we finis h, Steve is  going to stay on the 

s tage so pleas e feel free to come up here and c hat with Steve if you want to or  jus t s ay hello, s hake his  
hand, s o pleas e do that.
 
 
I want to thank all of you for being her e and our  audienc es  lis tening on the internet. We will 
have pr ograms  eac h Wednes day and Thurs day until 
mid
-
A ugust.  S o if you c an't c om e back  to the 
m us eum, ther e's program s  you will be able to get off the in
terne
t, inc luding today's  progr am.
 
 
It'
s  our  tr adition before you go
 
--
 
hold it, hold it.  It's  our  tr adition at
 
Firs t Per s on
 
that our Fir st 
Person gets  the last word to c los e our pr ogram .  So I'll turn to Steve to do that now.
 
> > Steven Fenves :  Thank  you.  
 
 
I had expected the last ques tioner
 
would lead with that question because I get it s o often
, t
he 
question of why am I doing this .  As  you c an tell, it's not the eas ies t thing in the world to do.  Today I 
kept m y c ool a little bit mor e than I norm ally do.  I br eak out s omewher e along the lin
e.  Sometimes it's 
alm os t totally unc onnec ted.  But anyhow, I do it bec aus e I feel this obligation as  a s ur vivor , as a 
witnes s , to do it to s peak  for thos e who didn't mak e it, to s peak  on the topics  that this  m us eum  is 
dedic ated to, to m ake s ure that people ar e aware how dis c r imination, s oc ial fr ic tion, r ac ial fr ic tion can 

lead to bigger and wor s e things
, a
nd to do whatever I c an to inc ulc ate in s om e of you the need to res is t 

12
 
 
that tem ptation and the need to be vigilant not just that the Holoc aust doesn't ha
ppen but that 
dis c r imination and intoleranc e does n't get to the point wher e, frankly, I think  it's  getting in s om e of the 
pr es idential r allies .
