W ebegin with this portrait taken in1940 or1941 of Steven Fenves and his sister, 
Estera.Steve was born on June
 
6, 1931, inSubotica, Yugoslavia.
 
 
T he arrow on this mapof  Yugoslavia in 1933pointsto Subotica.
 
 
Steve'sf ather, Louis,was the manager of the printing plantof  a Hungarian language 
daily newspaper and would later becom e theeditor of that same newspaper. His m other, 

Claire, was a graphic artist. In this photo we see Louis and Claireata horserace inSubotica in 

the 1920s. T hey are 
 

 
In thisphoto we see Steve andhisf am ily on an outing toaf arm  inthe summer of  
1940. In 1941, Germ any attacked Yugoslavi a and itsally, Hungary,  occupied Steve's town.
 
 
Life changed imm ediately f or Steve and hisfam ily. Jews in Suboticawere subjected 

 
2
 
to Hungarian racial laws which were m odeledaf ter those in Germ any. From Septem ber
 
1940 
to May
 
1944, Steve'sfam ily lived in one corner of  their apartm ent.
 
 
In May
 
1944, Germ any occupied Hungary, and Hungarian
-
occupied territories like 
Subotica.Soon after, Steve'sf ather was deported to Auschwitz whil e the restof  thefam ily was 
forced intoa ghetto inSubotica.
 
 
A t  t he  en d of  J un e
 
1944, Steve and som eof  hisf am ily m embers were sentto 
ano
ther ghettoand then to Auschwitz. Here we see an aerial reconnaissance photoof  

A u sch wit z-
Bi rkenau taken inSeptem ber
 
1944 by the U.S. Air Force. Thearrow points to the 
barrack that Steve was in from  June throughOctober
 
1944.
 
 
In October
 
1944, Steve was
 
sent to anothercam p at Niederorschel. OnApril
 
1 , 
1945, Steve was senton a Death March to the Buchenwald concentration Camp.
 
 
Steve was liberatedby the Americanson April
 
11,1945, just over 72 years ago. He 
wa s

on this mapof  Buchenwald, thearrow pointsto thebarrack where Steve spent.
 
 
Steve returned to Subotica and was reunited with his father and sister, but hisfather 
died less than six m onths af ter returning to Subotica.
 
 
Steve's m otherperished atAuschwitz. Steve andhis sister imm igrated to the U.S. in 
1950.
 
     
 
Af ter arriving in the U.S. in 1950, Steve was draf ted into the UnitedStates Arm y in 
1952.
 
After hisdischarge he enrolledat the Champaign
-
Urbana campus of the University of 
Illinois where he would eventually earnhis Ph.D. in civil engineering andbegin a42
-
year 
academ ic career inthe computingf ield at theUniversit y of  Illinoisand laterat Carnegie Mellon 

Universit y in Pittsburgh.
 
 
Af ter retiringf rom  Carnegie Mellon in1999, Steve andhis wif e, Norma, whom he 
m arried in 1955, moved totheW ashington, D.C. area wherehe worked for 10 years at the 

National Institute of  Standards and Technology (NIST ).
 
     
 
Steve and Norma have four children.Gregory is President of the University of T exas

D. C. a re a.
 
Steve and Norm ahave seven grandchildrenbetween theages of 10 
and32and, asof  May, a great

grandchild.
 
     
 
Stevef irst began speaking about his Holocaust experience in the late 1970s when 
he becam e the f ounding president of  a Holocaust Sur
vi vors' Organi zation in Pittsburgh.
 
Upon 
his second retirem ent, f rom the National Instituteof  StandardsandTechnology in Decem ber 
2009, Steve became active with this museum.
 
Inaddition to participating in the 
F i rs t  P e rs on
 
program , he also volunteers with themuseum's Visitor Services onThursdays.
 
     
 
In 2014, Steve published "TheLif eand Art of Klara Gereb:1897
-
1944," a book 
about hism other,a graphicartist who perished inAuschwitz, and her work that was rescued 
by her former cook during the deportations. Steve's granddaughter,Hannah, a graphic artist 

herself , was the designer of  thebook. Copiesof  the bookare availablefrom Am azon.
 
     
W ith that, I would like you to joinm e in welcom ing our 
F i rs t  Pers o n

[Applause]
 
>> B ill B e
nson:
 
Thankyou, Steve.T hank youso muchfor joining usandbeing willing to be our 
First Person today. T hank youfor that.
 
Youhave so much to tell us about what you went 
through during the Holocaust and we won't have tim e,I know, to talk about your 

pos
t -
Holocaustexperience but we'll start right away if  that'sok with you.

You were nearly 10 years old when thepartof  Yugoslavia where you lived was 
occupied by Hungary and yourf am ily's lif e would bef orever changed as a result.Before we 
tu rn  to tha t t
im e, let's begin with you telling us a littlebit about yourfam ily, your com munity, 

and yourself during thosefirst 10 years of  your lif e.
 
>> Steven Fenves:
 
Ok. First of  all, Yugoslavia was only 12 years older than I was.T he state 
was f ormed in 1
91 9 , as  
part of the VersaillesT reaty at the insistence of the Am erican 

President W ilson, self
-
determ inationof  thepeople,and hugeportions of  Hungary with seated 
to them inoritiesthat lived there.Slovakia, thenew stateof  Czechoslovakia, T ransyl vania, 

Rom ani
a,and the southern portionof thenew state of  Yugoslavia.
 
 
T hef am ily's culture, the Jewish society's culture, was entirely Hungarian.T he 
Yugoslav authorities insisted on speaking thenational language on the streets,butthat was 

largel y ignored. Yes, we went toSerbian schools but athom e we spoke Hungarian.T hat was 

normal.T he saying is that in that city even the dogs barked in two languages. 
 
>> 
[Laughter]
 
>> Steven Fenves: Everybody was tri
-
Lingual because there was asubstantial 
G e r m an
-
speaking population as well, and sowe all learned three languages.
 
 
W elived a very comf ortable, upperm iddle class lif e. Ourfam ily hada maid,a cook, 
a chauffeur
 
anda governess. Andbefore youthink that's sort of extravagant, you have to 
understand that Yugoslavia was a dirt poor country and the socialmorays was if  you could 

aff orda car, you certainly could afford to support anotherfam ily by hiring a driver. M y best 

f riend'sfather drove around in a 
F
iat. You now see them  on the streets again, the tiny 
F
i a ts .
 
You wonder how any adult canf it intothem .This gentlem an was practically ostracized by t he 

Jewish com munity forbeing so incentive tothe social
 
--
 
driving his own car rather than 
em ploying a person who can drive his car.
 
The governess was thesam e thing,at the level of  
m y cultural social standing of m y f am ily, it wa s absolutely m andatory that my sister and I have 

a Germ an
-
speaking governess so that we learn appropriate high Germ anand not the dialects 
spoken in the streets.
 
 
So lif e was very com fortable.W e had a very nice apartment
, i
n thesam e building 
that produced
 
--
 
that had theeditorial officesas well as theprintingplant. As a child, I could not 
fall asleep unless the printing plant was rolling, which m oved the whole building.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Infact, your newspaper that yourf ather was the editor of  was highly inf luential, 
wa sn 't it?
 
>> Steven Fenves:
 
T he newspaper was def initely the
 
--
 
well, beforethe war
 
--
 
f irs t  of  a ll,  it wa s  
vi e w
ed as " the" Jewish paper because the editors were Jewish. It wa s also very well
-
kno wn for 
its advocacy for the m inorities, the 
Serbs and Croats who lived there, made up about half  of 
the population.
 
 
Af ter the Yugoslav kingdom  was created, the paper was closedfora couple of years 
because of the Hungarian inf luence.T he Yugoslav governm ent was notanti
-
S em itic, p e r se, 
but itm adea big effortto separate the Hungarian
-
speaking Jews f rom  the Hungarian
-
speaking 
Hungarians two diff erent things here, ideologies that.W e'll com e into the story in afew 

m inutes.
 
 
And a
mong
 
--
 
in the Hungarian sector definitely the paper was thebellwether, the 
f lagship of  Hungarian culture inthis regionof Yugoslavia.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
I was struck by a couple of things that you shared wi thm e about the 
newspaper. One isthat you didhave to submit things to censors, governm ent censors,f or 

whatever was published. And theother that you shared with me, if Irem ember correctly, is 

 
4
 
when you came to theUnited States, there weref our Hungariannewspapers in the 
U
.S . an d  
three of  the four edi
tors had workedf or yourfather? 
 
>> Steven Fenves:
 
Plus a Hungarian literary j ournal in New York. Ye s, Hungary
 
--
 
I don't want 
to criticize your introductory speech,but yousaid Hungary followed Germany in its anti
-
S em it ic  
b e lief
s. Hungary precededGermany in many of  theirf undam ental
 
--
 
Hungary had a very bad 
experience with aborted Russian revolution in 1919,and a lot of badfeelings. A lot of the 
liberal journalistsf romHungary had tof leeand seek em ploym ent elsewhere. 12
 
k i l om et e r s  
f rom  the border 
it was thef irst stopfor all of these peoplef leeing Hungar y, and then later many 
of  them m igrated to the states, New York, Cleveland,T oronto, andChicago still had Hungarian 

language newspapers.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Steve,your m other was clearly a ver y tale
nted artist and the subject of your 
book. Tell us just a little bitabout your mother.
 
>> Steven Fenves:
 
My m other was
 
--
 
the local m useum , which incidentally
 
--
 
the new m useum 
is housed in what wasour home. It'sdescribed as thef irstacadem ically trained graphic artist 

in the city. She was very talentedf rom day one.W e have one of herdrawings f rom age 10, 

incredibly detailed, very meticulousdrawing. And she was very m uch influenced by her 

m aternaluncle who was one of
 
the leading architectsof the A
rt
 No u
veau
 
style that was very 
fashionable in Hungary, so she did a lot of decorative work. She traveled throughout Europe, 

studied in Budapest and Viennaand thentraveled to
 I
taly and France.
 
W hen she marriedm y 
father, who managed the plantthat had a small press that couldpress etchings anda larger 

press with a lithographic stone that couldproduce lithographs, shemadeuse of  theplant by 

converting m any of her sketches into lithographs and etchings. 
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Beforewe m ove on, I wantedto have
 
you just mention very brief ly, or I'll 
m ention, am ong your hobbies you were a pretty serious as a youngster stamp collector.And 

later that stamp collection would have im portance to yourf am ily.
 
>> Steven Fenves:
 
Yeah. My father was ver y helpful.T he newspaper had hundreds of local 
representatives, local reporters, etc., etc., through the region who were all writing in. He 

repeatedly asked them to use
 
--
 
not to use the regular run
-
of
-
th e
-
m ill stamps but use special 
editions. And they all cam e tothe newspaper. Andonce a week I made the round of all of the 

off ices that collected incom ingm ail and they hadall the envelopes ready f orm e.I hada m ini 

factory of  cutting out, soaking, sorting, etc. And whenever m y fatherwent to Budapestor 

Belgrade, I gave him  packages of used stamps totradef ornew issued. So it was a very n ice 

hobby.
 
 
Anyhow, it was a ver y comfortable life, vacations inthe 
A
lps. For som e reason we 
never got to theAdriatic, which was Yu goslavia's big touristfame, but we spent many 

vacatio
ns in theAlps.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And all of  that would change in 1941 whenGermany invaded Yugoslavia and 
their ally, Hungary, occupied the partedof  Yugoslavia where you lived. From the very f irstday 

of  the occupation your fam ily and community were im m ediately subjected toprofound 

upheaval. Tell us whathappened.
 
>> Steven Fenves:
 
On the very f irst day, m y father was expelledf rom  hisposition in theplant 
by a Hungarian officer with a drawn f irearm .The plant was conf iscated and turned over to 

produce a 
r i gh t
-
wing H ungarian paper. All of the Jewish establishments were
 
ex
propriated and 
Aryan m anagers were assigned to run it.T heonethat was assignedto this paper hadone aim  

andthat was to popularize thefam ily. He closedm y f ather'sand m yaunt'saccoun
ts to the 

personal checking accounts and charged theentire payroll of the large plantto their personal 

 
5
 
a cco un t s.  
 
So very soon thef am ily had todepend on selling whatever possessions we had, 
including m y stam p collectionandhandy work  that m y mother couldorganize, which she did 

extrem ely wel l. Shehad sort of a m inifactory of  her printsand others working f or her
,  
k n it t in g
 
--
 
m ostly knitting but crocheting, weavi ng, whatever handy works couldbe sold.Soshe 
kept thefam ily going.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 A s 
you m entionedearlier, you had a German governess or nanny. On the very 
f irst day of  the occupation she lef t.
 
>> Steven Fenves:
 
She wasn't going to spend another night ina dirty Je w's houseand lef t.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And plus, I think,one of th
e  f irs t  o rd
ers was that nonon
-J
ews could workfor 
Je ws.  

>> Steven Fenves:
 
Yeah. So the staff went, which had to go anyhow because we had no 
income to pay them .
 
 
T he other Hungarian rule thatprecededanything that Germ any cam eup with atthe 
tim e,a law nam ed num erus clausus was introduced inthe early 1920s, restricting Jewish 

access to higher education, tothe sam eproportion as the proportion of  Jews in thetotal 

population, which, you know, numerically m akes sense but when you realize that80%of  the 

population were illiterate Serbs bound tothe earth thatthey laboredon, then it's sortof outof  

k ilt e r.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
So Jews m ade up 3% of thepopulation.
 
>> Steven Fenves:
 
About6% of the population. More in the cities. Muchm ore in Budapest.
 
 
But anyhow, you had to take atesttoenterf ifth grade, which wasf irst grade of 
academ ichigh school. Fortunately that summer m y father had no other business, sincehewas 

just deposed,and sohe spent theentire summ er coachingm efor this entrance exam and I 

was one of
 
t he  
ni
ne that was adm itted, which didn'tmakem uch differenceatall.W e sat in the 
back row. Raising your  handm ade absolutely nodiff erence. No teacher ever calledon you.
 
 
Later on, the f ather of  a f riend did a history of the high school. I asked him, as he 
was going through therecord, to getm e thenam es of the nine people. He sent me with a note
, 

d
id you know you had to pay tuition inaddition to this restrictionand in additiontothe 
treatm ent that you received? Af ree public school charged thenineJewish bastards tuition. 

Half of  thehouse was occupied
 
--
 
the apartment was occupied by military. So it was a ver y 
increasingly severe restriction.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
So you were f orced to houseGerm anm ilitary off icers.
 
>> Steven Fenves:
 
Hungarian.
 
>> B i l
l Benson:
 
Hungarian off icers.
 
>> Steven Fenves:
 
Right. So it was three very strenuous years. My father'shealth deteriorated 
quite a bit. My m other's even worse.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Yourf ather, I believe, was subjectedtoa trial relatedto the business. Righ
t?
 
>> Steven Fenves:
 
T rial to legitim ize the takeover of all of the businesses there were trials. My 
father andm y aunt's lasted half a day. T hey were tried in abs
ent
ia. A n ti
-
S em i t i c  ve n om  pour ing 
outof  the witnessesand prosecution. It's a terrible stres
s  o n t he m .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And as terrible asthose threeyears were, Steve, things became inf initely far 
worse. In the spring of  1944, with Hungary about to capitulate to theallies, Germ any moved 

into occupied Hungary, including where you lived. T ellus what happened when the Germ ans 

cam e in and why they cam e in.
 
>> Steven Fenves:
 
W ell, schools were closed. One of the very f ew nice things they did
 
--
 
t hi s  

 
6
 
was I think May.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
1944.
 
>> Steven Fenves:
 
M ay
 
1944.T hey discharged all the Jews. T hey
 
gave us certif icates thatwe 
com pleted that year, which was helpful whenwe had to re
-
enter thestream af ter the war.
 
T he Jewish star was introduced, which m y motherm ade. I don't know where she got the 
yello w cloth but we went into mass production. She was cutting outand sewing them . My sister 

andI were turning them  inside
-
out
 
--
 
ou t s i de
-
in. And she checked our work. T he couple of 
stars here displa
y
ed wouldnever have passed m y mother's critique. So that'show we spent a 
couple of  weeks.
 
 
T he  in te llige n
tsia of the town, lawyers, etc., including newspapermen, were all 
deported, collected in onenight.W e saw a father going away, nobody to ever see him  again. 

T hey were sent toAuschwitz ver y early. Andthen we were ordered to vacateour prem isesand 

m ove i
nto a m akeshif t ghetto.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Steve,you described that theleaving of  your home to go tothe ghetto asone 
of  your grim m est memories.
 
>> Steven Fenves:
 
Definitely. Def initely.We lived on the secondf loor. I don't know how this 
event was advertised,whether the papers carried notices. But by the tim e we got ready to 

leave theapartm ent with whatever we were allowed to carry, the staircase down to the streets 

people were linedup,backed againsteach other, waiting to ransack the apartment. Until 
that 

was happening, as wewere going b y, they screamedat us, yelled at us, spatonus.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And these hadbeen your neighbors?
 
>> Steven Fenves:
 
Yup, everybody f rom  thecity.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Therewas one exception.
 
>> Steven Fenves:
 
T here was 
one exception, a form er m aid who th
ree years earlier we had to 
let go, was in the line.She grabbedthef am ily cookbookand shef ound somewhere afolder 

and shoved into it whatever artwork on paper she couldf ind, lithographs, sketches, etc.,and 

took those and after the war returnedthem  to us.
 
 
If yo u  g
o into the "SomeW ere Neighbors"  exhibit, you'll see m y m other's cookbook 
which m y sister and Idonated.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
So you were f orced into a ghetto.Tell us about that.
 
>> Steven Fenves:
 
T wo or three 
fam ilies per room , non
-
existent feeding stations, m inimal 
sanitary facilities. Fortunately the area
 
--
 
the wall was porous enough so thatpeople likeour 
form er cook could sneak in som ef ood.Alsosom e people were able to sneak out.T hat just 

lasted a coup
leof days. Then onem orning we were lined up atthe railroad siding
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
I'm going to stop you. One thing I want you to share. You had shared with 
me
 
--
 
you were bornon June
 
6. Your 13thbirthday, 1944, you received what you called a 
welcom
e birthday present.And that was?
 
>> Steven Fenves:
 
I was one of the very f ew people who had passage to go out of the ghetto. 
Af ormer mechanic of the newspaper was a Serb and he wasf ired together with all theSerb 

and Croats when the Hungarians tookover
 
the newspaper. Hehada small machine shop. 
W hen schools closed,I went to work for him as am achinist apprentice and that lasted in the 

ghetto as well. 
 
 
So I was out of the ghetto on June
 
6,1944. I couldhave been thef irst person to 
bring back the news heardf rom  the clandestined radio that the allied invasion had started. And 

a week later we were deported
, e
n
tirely by Hungarian gendarm e. Idid not see aGerman 
soldier until Auschwitz. So do a littlem ath.T he entire Germ an occupying f orce was 400peop
le  

 
7
 
and in am atterof  six weeks they deported400,000 Jews to Auschwitz. Prodigious, 
r i gh t
?  
Except they were notthere. The gendarme had a plan, worked outyears in advanceof  what 
they were going to do, andall they needed
 
--
 
they couldn't get the approval f rom  the Hungarian 
governm ent bef ore but under the pressure oftheoccupation they got the 
a
pproval and they 
went to work. Andthat was well advertised. Ihave seen copies of thef ront pageof  the 

Budapest newspaper describing thedeportation. A colonel of the gendarme giving orders, etc., 

e tc. 
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Steve,you arrived at Auschwitz. You were with your m other, I believe your 
sister, your grandm other.
 
>> Steven Fenves:
 
Yup.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W hat ha p pe n ed  t o the m ?
 
>> Steven Fenves:
 
W el l ,  s o m e of  
yo
umay have seen "Schindler's List"  and youm ay have 
seen
 
--
 
rem em ber thescene when the children who were m istakenly senttoAuschwitz 
debarkedf rom the trains and theplatf orm ,nicely sloping platf orm is put infront of them and 

t h e y ve r y g
in gerl y walk ed 
down this plank.W ell, there was no suchplank. You either jum ped 
outor you were thrown out, hundreds andhundredsof SS,dogs, inm ates, everybody yelli ng, 

ever ybody shouting, incredible stench hittingyou that is still in m y nostrils today. Everybody 

p il
ed outside. Eventually m en and wom en separated. My m other and sister went one way, I 

went theother way. M y grandmother wentnowhere. Shehad a severe lim pand was sitting 

there waiting to be taken to the crem atorium
 
--
 
to the gas cham ber.
 
 
In  f ro nt of a  G
erman off icer
 
--
 
m any people will tell you that that was Dr.
 
Mengele. I 
cannot tell you that. I was not introduced to the gentlem an. All I know is a Germ an off icer with 

white glo ves looking over thousands of people, directing people right and lef t. I went 
th is wa y. I 

didn't know what theother way was. For about 24hours I didn't know what the other sidewas.
 
I wound up inthis longline, ina hugebuilding, nofood, no drinkaf ter five day andf ive nights in 

the locked car, railroad car, eventually shaved of  allbody hair, cold shower, som e disinfectant 

thrown at you, battered camp clothes,etc., thrown at you, eventually into com pounds, 

com pounds C,E, thatwas shown on the slide. I was in thatpicturebecause inSeptem ber I 

wa s  s t ill in  A u s c h wit z.
 
>> B i l l
 
Benson:
 
And you were 13 years old.
 
>> Steven Fenves:
 
I was 13 years old and so were a thousand other kids in thatblock.It was 
called the youth block. Andall of us were putthere.Sof rom the people who hadbeen therefor 

a time, wef oundout, that the other line wentto the gas chamber.And the sm ell, the stench 

was of  theburningf lesh and bonesf rom  the crem atorium plusm ixed with small f ragm ents of  

prayer books that were sort of spreading everywhere in theair.
 
Onefeeding a day out of a 
barrel. One run tothe latrine oncea day. 
 

 
You learned things in that setting. Forexam ple, take theadvice of an older person 
that running towards the latrineto try topick a sm oothpebbleontheground so youhave 

som ething to wif e yourself with. Unf ortunately toiletpaper was notone of the things provided in 

the latrines.
 
Learnedthe stenchnot justf rom  the crem atorium butf rom  your own body, your 
own clothes, weeks,months with no change in clothes,no shower, excrem ent, urine, you 

carried with you in your own
 
clothes.
 
 
T he other thing you learned is thatpeople, the spirit diesfaster than the body. 
Ever ywhere in cam p you saw these shuff lingbodies, glazed
-
over eyes not seeing anything, 
ju st sh uffl
ing. The slang cam p called them muscle men, totally im pervious to what was going 
on. Usually carried outin the morning with the night's deadon the cart directly to the

crem atorium. No point in wasting gas on somebody who is already i n that condition.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Steve,you ended up becom ing an interpreter while 
at  A u sch wit z.
 
>> Steven Fenves:
 
Yup.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
How did that happen? 
 
>> Steven Fenves:
 
W ell, this horrendous, this horrible wom an who was our governess did one 
service. M y sister did not benef itf rom  itbutatthattim e in Auschwitz the inm ate orderlies were 
Germ an crim inals brought inf rom  prisons to control the inm ates.They spoke only German. 

T hem ajority of  the kids in ourbarracks spoke only Hungarian.They needed an interpreter. 

And somehow they picked m e. So I becam e an interpreter. T he only re
ward was that af ter the 
troops weref edf rom  the barrels, Ihad the privi lege of going at thattim e with a spoon and 

scraping outthe bottom  of the barrelsf or a little morefood.
 
 
T he big change, the really big change in m y life, was a couple of m onths later. In late 
August
 
--
 
the date iseasy to lookup.It's very well docum ented, theday when the gypsy 
fam ilies in Auschwit z were slaughteredone single night,f rom  the barracks adjacent itour 

b a rra cks.  
T hef ollowing day there were inmates cleaning outthe
 
barracks, whitewashing inside 
andoutside.And whatwas m ost noticeable to us is that their supervi sors were not wearing the 

green triangle of  crim inals but had the red triangle of  political prisoners. Oneof  them  cam e 

over. He wanted a translator of Polish, Hungarian, and Germ an. I had never heard a word of  

Polish bef ore but I f igured 
if  i t ™
s aSlavic language like Serbian, then it can't bethat different 
andI volunteered. And I became an interpreter to them .T hat was whenI decided I hada 

chance to liv
e . 
 
 
Up to that point there was absolute conviction that I wouldfollow these musclem en 
out into the crem atorium asall of m y classmates by then haddone.T hesepeople were all 

political prisoners caught up inW arsaw and other Polish cities, a good partof
 
them  university 
students. May have been violent anti
-
Sem ites butdecidedfor the duration of the hostilities that 
thatm atteredm uch less than resisting the SS. SoI workedf or them . They drumm ed intomy 

13
-
year
-
old head that,no, you'renot going todie;
 
you have a chance tof ightf or your survival 
and f ight f or the survi val of  others.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
That work enabled you to locate your sister.
 
>> Steven Fenves:
 
Yes. Inaddition to being a translator, including translatingf or the German 
foreman who came
 
toselect workers, I alsowas on a roof repair detail that hadperm ission to 
go f rom  compoundto com pounddoing little roof  repair, mostly blackm arketeering, etc.W e 

particularly went tothis one wom en's compound because oneof  thePolish 
kap o
' s  girlf rie
nd 
was a female ina woman's com pound.And that's how Im etm y sister. If ound out that shewas 

on the way out, scheduled to be sent outonan outgoing transport.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
For slave labor? 
 
>> Steven Fenves:
 
For slave labor. It turned out to be a light bulbfactory. So I cashed inall of  
m y black market goods and got her a scarf and a sweater.T his was October, sothings were 

getting chilly, f or her to take with her when she was shipped out.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Steve,you were at Auschwitz forf ive m onths. Ina truly astounding way you 
were able to get out ofAuschwitz in October of 1944and ended up at a satellite camp of 

Buchenwald. Tell ushow you got out of Auschwit z.
 
>> Steven Fenves:
 
W ell, things by September, October, things in Auschwit z were slowi
n g 
down butthef orem anstill cam e lookingf or workers so there were still outgoing transports.T he 

Polish kaposdecided to smuggle m e out in one of the transports. So they arrangedf orm e to 

tradeplacesfor another personand shovedme into this line. I got m y tattoo.
 

 
9
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
As you were leaving.
 
>> Steven Fenves:
 
Yes, by thattim e in Auschwit z, incom ing
 
--
 
there were so many inmates 
com ing in that they we re nottattooedanym ore
, o
nly those who went out.
 
S o a  lit t le  b it  m o re 
pleasant train ride.At least they stopped once aday to let us get out, stretch our legs, usethe 
siding.W earrived at this sm all cam p in a village called Niederorschel. Lined up, SS gave a 

speech, theforeman gave a speech. A Hungarian interpreter interpreted it. And then th
e 
foreman came up to me and said, "W hatareyou doing here? Ididn't select you in Auschwi tz."  

I had been his interpreter when he was in Auschwit z selecting worke rs.
 
 
W ell, the Polish kapos drilled m e the way I think presidential candidates aredrilled 
b ef
ore debates, to be readyf or any eventuality that could possibly arise. This was notone that 
they foresaw. Sothere I stood.I clearedm y throat.And I said,"W ell, with this m any new 

inm ates they thought you would need another interpreter." That'sthe one thing that came to 

m ind.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And it worked.
 
>> Steven Fenves:
 
And it worked. Not just that Ibecam e an interpreter but the grilling
 
--
 
t he 
real grillin g I got was not f rom  the guards. It cam ef rom  the inm ates
, i
m mediately surrounded 
m e.
 
>> B i
ll Benson:
 
Because you were under suspicion.
 
>> Steven Fenves:
 
Yes. How com e theforem an knew you? How com e your clothes are so 
m uch better than others, etc., etc. So it took som e timefor me to convince them that I knew 

things that they didn't know.
 
 
One 
of  theorderlies was a gypsy. He had heard that something had happened to the 
Rom apopulation inAuschwitz. I could tell him that I was there and whathappened. So I was 

acceptedby the people, by the small group that sort of controlled the camp
,  
but I was
 
put to 
work like ever ybody else. Six anda half  days a week, 14
-
hour workdays, m anufacturing the 
win gs of  airplanes, f ighter planes.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Spenda moment telling us about theactsof  sabotage.
 
>> Steven Fenves:
 
W e did whatever we could.
 
>> B ill 
Benson:
 
Building these wings.
 
>> Steven Fenves:
 
People
 
--
 
particularly thepeople at the electrical stations, installing landing 
gear, f laps, control rods and the wiring that controlled them .T hey could occasionally cut a 

bunch of wires and stop the produc
t ion  lin e.
 
 
I worked at thenext to last inspection station inspecting rivets that never properly
 
--
 
and checkingf orpossible tears in thealum inum  skin.W e could som etim es just stop the 

assembly line until those were corrected. Som etim es we could gloss over errors that we saw 

and let itpass through the next station wherecam ouf lagepaint was applied to it and covered 

it .
 
 
Noneof  these planesever f lew. Thisf actory was set uponly in thespring of 1944, 
af ter thebig industrial establishm entshad been bombed to sm ithereens. T his was an attem pt 

for organized analternate supply line which didn't work. T he railroad lines were bom bed.W e 

were getting f ewer and fewer parts to install and sending out lessand less com plete wings. But 

they keptus there.
 
>> B i
ll Benson:
 
Steve,onething I want to ask you about. You had said to me thatat 
Niederorschel you saw how humans couldf unctionunder conditions a bitbetter than 

A u sch wit z.  

>> Steven Fenves:
 
W ell, the im portant part of theday was the night.T here was a l
arge 

 
10
 
comm on area. A couple hours before lights out.W ell,
 
you 
would expect to have shoemakers 
who couldf ix shoes. You would expecttohave tailors with barteredneedle and thread 
obtainedf rom the Germ ans, civilian workers,  repair clothing. Som eskills you didn't expect. 

You didn't expect tof ind diam ond grinders reportedf rom  Belgium  who attemptedto grind 

prescription glassesout of  thebottom s of m ilk bottlesf ound by the wayside. I don't know if  they 

worked but. Jewelers
 
--
 
taking anything f rom the fac
tory was, of  course, punishableby death. 
Ever ybody was workin g on scrapsof  alum inum . Jewelers making these gorgeousboxes. It 

was close to Christmas for the civilian worker s.W reathsfor Christmas were a big thing.T hey 

would bring in big sheets of dried
 
grass and the inmates would makethese elaborate wreaths 
outof  it which could earn something on theblack market.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
And here you are still a boy,fellow inm ates wanted to educate you.W hat did 
they doabout your education?
 
>> Steven Fenves:
 
Af ter all of  this, there were about half a dozen kids m y age. Some people 
decided thatour education shouldnot be stopped. You know, after 14
-
hour work, couple of 
hours of sharpening weapons,took us asideto give us lessons in history and French and 

a lg
ebra. Idon't think anything stuck with m ebut.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
But they tried.
 
>> Steven Fenves:
 
T hey tried. Religious people did the sam ething. Rehearsalf or Friday night 
service went onall week. I m ean,everybody knew the service by heart but they also knew the 

weekl y T orah readingby heart and the servic es were special, servic es were holidays, huge 

discussionsamong the people who knew what is the proper language. Absolutely am azing.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
You rem ainedat Niederorschelf orm ore than six m ont
h s u n t il Ap ril of  
19 4 5 
when you were f orcedon a d
eath 
m
arch.T ellus what that was andwhere you went.
 
>> Steven Fenves:
 
T hatm arch was announced onenight.T he younger people in the 
resistanceorganization wantedto stage a revolt.W e had some weapons.
 
>
> Bill Benson:
 
That youm ade secretly andwere hiding.
 
>> Steven Fenves:
 
Yeah. T he inm ates took the food to the guards' quarters. W e knew where 
the guards' weapons were. T here was a chance that we could do som ething. T he olderpeople 

were against it. Sothefollowing m orning we went
 
--
 
we started. Af ter thef irst couple of days, a 
breakf rom  thefactory. It was spring but thenit got m ore andm oretenuous. Food was 

practically non
-
existent. People were falling by the ways ide and were shot by the guards. 
Pe o
ple attem pted to escape at night. Som ewere successful. It was ver y disheartening when 
thefollowing m orning thefarm ers in the areabrought back theescapeesf rom the night before, 

using barbed
-
wire to tie their hands. That was sad.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
A n d  yo
u had your arm broken on them arch.
 
>> Steven Fenves:
 
My arm broken. Yeah, just sort of stum bled intoBuchenwald. I couldorient 
m yself f rom the descriptionsof people who had been there. First thing I noticed was the 

crem atorium chimney was not smoking, so that was a positive sign. Second, we were led 

directly into the main cam p, no quarantine, etc. Third, no SS inside the cam p.T here were only 

inm ates inside the camp. And them ajority by t hen were wearing the red beretsof  the camp 

resistance organization
. So we were just shown an empty barrack.Somebody pointedata 

placefor me to lie down and I laid down. I had anticipated participating in the great revolt that 

all of  theolder inm ates were talking about. Ifell asleep. And thenext af ternoon somebody 

w
oke m e up to tellm ethatthe Am ericanshad arrived. 
 
 
So lotsof  stories about 
l
iberation of Buchenwald.Thef unny thing about it isthe 
Norwe gian stories, theinm ates leading the uprising is Nor wegian, and in French the leading 

 
11
 
theuprise were the French
 
and soondown the line. So I have todial m yself out. Ihad no 
direct contact with any of that.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W hendid you realizef ully that you were liberated? 
 
>> Steven Fenves:
 
W ell,  we  s a w
 
--
 
we racedup to the barbed
-
wire f enceand the Am erican 
j
eeps and trucks, a
ndarm ored vehicles of the 6th A
rmo re d 
D
ivision  were going by with 
ever ybody, soldiers looking at usas zoo animals, I would say.T heyhadnever seen anything 
like that.T hat was obvious.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 A
s we noted inthe beginning, you spent several months in af ield hospital 
recuperating and made your wa y back toSubotica.W hatdid
 
you 
f ind in Subotica?
 
>> Steven Fenves:
 
First of all, the hospital was very eff iciently run.Just to give you a sense of  
what the continues were, this was 120th Field 
E
vacuation Hospital. Doctors, nurses,etc.The 
Am erican nurses were sent to temporary duty elsewhere becausethe com mand of the hospital 

decided the work was too 
oner
ou s
 
f orAmerican wom en to do. So they locally re
-
hired the 
Germ an nurses thathad worked in the hospital f or the woundedSS.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Sothey now were the nurses in thef ield hospital.
 
>> Steven Fenves:
 
Anyhow, a long negotiation. You know, the IronCurtain was up. French, 
Norwe gian, Dutch, Belgian people were out in 24 hours atmost.W e were therefor three 

m onthsbefore we got the perm ission to cross into Soviet territory, Soviet
-
controlled territory, 
andeventually go back.
 
 
People askm e this question, what was it like. I don't know. I just gotoff  the train and 
started walking. I knew I had oneaunt who was not considered subject to deportation by 

Hungarian racial laws. I went toher house. Acouple of  weeks later my sister did,and a couple 

of  weeks laterm y father was brought back on a Soviet Arm y train
 
--
 
Arm y hospital train. So we 
tried to starta new life.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W hat kind of condition was your sister in? 
 
>> Steven Fenves:
 
Ok, she was liberated in Bergen
-
Belsenaf ter a case of T yphus but she 
wa s o k.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
But yourf ather was not.
 
>> Steven Fenves:
 
O h,
 
no. I have the entrance
 
--
 
I have theadm ission diagnosisf rom  the 
Soviet m ilitary hospital
: 
angina, kidneyf ailure, broken teeth, mental and physical deterioration, 
e tc. H
e never recovered.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
You shared with m e, though
,  
that despite that he
 
did m ake an attem pt to 
restart his lif e.
 
>> Steven Fenves:
 
Oh, yes. Very m uch so. He tried getting thepaper back.T hat was 
im possible. But we got a small vineyard back. So we had som emoney. Yes, my f ather was 

ver y anxious to connect with m y m aternal uncle who had em igrated to the states in the 1920s. 

He sent aff idavits to my sister and m e but he just couldn't do it any further.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Inthe little time that we have lef t,as you said, the Iron Curtain was up. You 
were now under the Soviet control. You would live therefor several years.
 
 
Bef ore we leave theprogram  today, tell ushow you and your sistergot outof  
Yugoslavia.
 
>> Steven Fenves:
 
W ell, two of m y cousins survi ved. Both of them were engaged. Sothesix 
of  u s , i n  an  18
-
m on t h pe r i o d ,  go
t together in Paris, f ive different ways . My older cousinandhis 
f i an c
ée  
were bornbefore Yugoslavia existedso they could reclaim  their Hungarian citizenship. 
My younger cousin's 
f iancé
e  
was Hungarian.Sheonly came in the late 
`
30s. My cousin 
m anaged to
 
escape into Switzerland but theSwiss sort of  keep watch over things like thatand
 

 
12
 
the Swiss police cameand said, ﬁY
ou're here illegall y.
ﬂ 
T hey said, 
ﬁY
e s. ﬂ ﬁ
W here did you com e 
f r om ?
ﬂ ﬁ
France.
ﬂ 
So Swiss policem
e
n tookhim  across the border, paid ticket and waitedfor the 
train to Paris. 
 
>> 
[Laughter]
 
>> Steven Fenves: My sister and I,through the help of a couple of form er POW s who were on 

the liberation trainf rom Bergen
-
Belsen, that she cam e hom e on, they helped us get passports, 
legal passports and exit visas. They didn't have the authorization to issue them  but they issued 

them  to uson thebasis of  that we got out.As soon as we got out toParis, we renounced our 

Yugoslav citi zenship. The French were ver y supportive.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Made it to the United Statesand then you got drafted.
 
>> Steven Fenves:
 
Righ t .
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
W e'regoing to close our program  inam om ent. As you clearly sa w, we only got 
a glim pseof  every part of  what you heardf rom  Steve, you just gota glim pse of it. And, of  

course,
 
whathappened Postwar for Steve we didn't even get intoexcept for that littlebit at the 
end.
 
 
Because we don't have timef or questions with you today, Steve is going
 
to
 
rem ain 
on the stage when we f inish the program .W e invite anybody who wants to come 
u p on t he 

stage, when wef inish
 
--
 
>> Steven Fenves:
 
I'llget down at thebottom.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
All right.T o talk to Steve,askhim  questions, get your photo taken with him , 
just say hi and shakehis hand if  you would like todothat.
 
 
It's o u r tra d itio
n a t
 
F i rs t P e rs on
 
t ha t  ou r  
F i rs t  P e rs o n
 
hasthe last word, so I'm going 
to turn back toSteve to closeour program . Bef orehedoes, I just want to remind you we'll have
 
F i rs t  P e rs on
 
program s eachW ednesday and Thursday through the m iddle of  August.W ehope
 
that you can come back another tim e. But if  not, them useum 's website will have inf ormation 
about the program  in 2018.
 
 
T hanksfor being here.
 
 
Steve? 
 
>> Steven Fenves:
 
W ell, as thef irst question ver y of ten is sim ply som ebody asking me why I'm 
doing this.As you could tell, it's notthe easiest thing to do. Ihave gotten past theearlier years 

where I brokedown som ewhere in thetalk, couldnever predict where but somewhere. It 

happened.But I do itbecause asa survivor, as a witness, I have an obligati
o n  to  do  s o,  an 
obligation to them illions of  people who didn'tsurvi ve. I feel that it's up tom e to let people like 

yourselves know what inhumanity the humanm ind canproduceandhow easy it is to move 

f rom prejudice, discrimination againstanybody to m oreand more oppressive levels of  

separation, leading up to genocide andthe Holocaust.
 
 
If you walk through the m useum , sitting at the Inf orm ation Desk I tell people 
whatever genocide dejour you're interested in, we ever an exhibit on it. Because itall 

h
appenedaf terthe Holocaust when som any people were convinced that this wouldnever, 
again, be repeated.So whatever I can do and whatever I can say, it's m y obligation to warn 

people thatprejudice,discrim ination can escalateto the levels thatescalated in what wasthen 

them ost advancedand most [Indiscernible] country on theEuropean continent.
 
>> Bill Benson:
 
Thank you, Steve.

[Applause]
