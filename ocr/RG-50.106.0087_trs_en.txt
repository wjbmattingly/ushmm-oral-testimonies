Question: This is the United 
Stated Holocaust Memorial 
Museum Volunteer Collection 
interview with Elizabeth Strassburger, cond
ucted by Margaret Garrett on October 31, 
1997, in Rockville, Maryland.  This interview is part of the museum's project to 
interview Holocaust surv
ivors and witnesses who are also 
volunteers with the museum.   
Tape number one, side A:   

Q: Name at birth?   
A: Elzbieta Lusthaus.   
Q: And the date of birth?   

A: May 15, 1938.   
Q: And place of birth?   
A: Krakow, Poland.   

Q: Would you talk ab out your ch ildhood?   

A: Yes.  My parents were living in Iwonicz, 
which is a spa in the mountains.  My father 
was a physician, and he and my  mo ther had b
een married for two years when I was born.  
They  were very happy togethe
r, they were looking forward to
 my  birth, and things were 
pretty idyllic. In 1939, the 
war broke out in Poland.  Th
e Germans invade
d Poland, and 
my father, being a physician, ha
d to join the Polish Army.   
Before he left for wherever he was going to 
be sent, he went to say good-bye to his 
parents, who were living in Lwow.  At th
at time Poland was par
titioned, and Lwow was

in the Russian sector, and wher
e we were living was in the Ge
rmansector.  Andwhenhe 
tried to get back to us, he was taken as a 
prisoner of war to Siberia.  When  he didn't 
come back, my mother
 became very worried. 
 But she was a very strong and resourceful 
woman, and so what she did wa
s she sold everything she c
ould in the little town, because 
I think we were probab ly one 
of the few Jewish families; th
ere may have been  one or two 
others.  And she went to Tarnow, and Tar
now was where her mo ther was living.  And 
so where does a young wo man who doesn't ha
ve a husband with a small child, go? Back  
to her own mo ther, and we lived
 in Tarnow.  And when I did 
the show interview, I didn't 
know that we were in a ghetto, but I found so
me papers of my  mo ther's which said that 
we were in a ghetto.  Part of the time we liv
ed in Tarnow with my  grandmother, and then 
we were taken to the ghetto.  And my moth
er was allowed to go 
out and work for the 
Germans.  My mother was a pharmacist, but 
I don't know if that's  what she was working 
as.  Irememberwhen 
they took my  grandmother.  I was probably about three years old, 
I remember when she went. 
 And fro m my  mo th er 's p a p e
rs I learned that she was 
concerned th at they were going to do anothe
r transport with young ch ildren.  And so  
because she was able t o  go out, she had 
connections, and she found someone who sold 
her Christian papers, so that we went to a 
place called M ilanowek Potashawol (phonetic).  
I think it was probably around 1943.   
Q: Now, this was in '4 3, and so you 
would have been five years old?   
A: Yes.  It may have been '42.
  I have pictures of my self 
in Tarnow in '42, so I would 
assume it was either '4 2 or '43 
that we went to Milanowek.   

Interview with Elizabeth Strassburger

Q: And you had different 
names on the papers?   
A: Yes.  My name was Barbara Stachura a
nd my  mother was Maria Stachura, and we 
lived with a lady by the name of Mrs. Ge
sia, which is a diminutive of Genowefa 
Bandyrowa, and her two daughters.   
Q: And how did you find them or
 how did they find you?   
A: They were friends of friends of my pare
nts.  Somehow they had no co nnection to  us 
but they were willing to hide us, and so  we 
lived with them until th
e end of the war.  
And at times I lived upstairs 
with my mother, at times I li
ved in th e basement.  I was 
usually drugged wh en I was put in the base
me nt because it was a dangerous time and my  
mother had access, I guess, to medication.  At
 times I was allowed to
 play outside, and 
my best friend at that time was W isia, and 
Wisia was the younger daughter wh o was nine 
years older than I, so she was pr
obably  14 or so, give or take, and sh e was my  best friend, 
and I'm still in contact with Wisia.   
Q: Now, backing up, some of this 
story has been told to you?   
A:Yes.  Yes.   

Q: What is the earliest th
ing that you rememb er?   
A: I don't remember my father, 
obviously; he left when  I wa
s 16 months old.  I certainly 
reme mb er my  mo th er.  I reme mb er my  
grandmother, and I remember the Germans 
taking her.  That's a very, very vivid memo ry
 for me. I know th ere was a place that had 
stone seats, and my  mo ther had always said to
 me if anything bad is happening, you go 

Interview with Elizabeth Strassburger
  
6 
 
   
   
   
   
   
into this place and you hide under the seat. 
 And wh en th ey took my  grandmother, I went 
and I hid under the seat.   
Q: This was in the town? 
A: No, this was in the ghetto.   

Q: Okay, in the -- okay.  Okay
.  Soyourememberthat?   
A: I remember that.  And I was three, probab
ly three or three and a half.  And I don 't 
reme mb er going to  Milanowek, but I reme mber
 living there.  I remember th e house, I 
remember the room that we had.  We had a very, very large stove
 which had tiles on it, 

and that was the only place that you got warmth.   
Q: So you and your 
mo ther had a room for yourselves?   
A: Right, right.   
Q: And did you spend all of your time in th
e room, or did you live with the fami ly?   
A: We lived with the family.  The house was 
just partitioned into lots and lots of little 
rooms, and there were lots of people living 
there.  People were coming and people were 
going.  It was also the headquarters for 
the Polish Underground, and there were little 
eagles on the windows, and when it was safe, th
ey flashed certain colors, and there was a 
cupboard with a false b ack.  I mean, this was 
a very exciting place in which to  be. But I 

thought I was Christian.  I we
nt to church; my  mo ther never went to church .  I never 
questionedthat.   
Q: Who did you go to church  with?   

Interview with Elizabeth Strassburger
  
7 
 
   
   
   
   
   
A: I went to church with the Bandyrowa 
family, with my best friend Wisia and her 
mo ther and her older sister, and 
at times I went to school.   
Q: So that's  something that yo
u just always did, and it --  
A: Oh, absolutely.   
Q: You didn't think 
anythingofit?   
A: No.  I was getting ready for my first co mmuni
on, I was preparing; I mean, this was it.  
And the Germans were there a
nd everybody hated the Germans, and there were secrets, 
but in those days, unlike now, ch
ildren didn't question.  If the 
parents said this is what's 
going to  happen, that was it.  Sometimes my 
mother would go away for days at a time, 
and I never questioned.  If I asked Wisia, sh
e would say I think your mo ther's  work ing in 
a different town , or the Germans are looking fo
r people, and sh e was hiding, or whatever.  
And there were other people in
 the house that were hiding, 
so it was not anything alien in 
any way.   
Q: And what was your unders
tanding of wh at the other 
people were doing th ere?   
A: There was a war going on, there were bom
bs falling, people's houses were being 
destroyed, people's families 
werebeingkilled.  Peoplesh
ared.  You know, if you had 
food, you shared it with other 
people; if they had food, th
ey shared it with you.  I 
reme mb er being hungry.  There wasn't always
 enough fo od, but we grew vegetables, and 
we had milk that was brought 
in, and we did the best we c
ould.  But everybody shared, 
and it was war, and there were bombs falling. 
 There was very little 
meat, because all the 

Interview with Elizabeth Strassburger
  
8 
 
   
   
   
   
   
meat went to the front for the soldiers, and th
e Germans were taking a lot of stuff.  And 
everybody hated the Germans.  I me
an, that was a common thing.   
Q: And do you remember 
hating the Germans?   
A: Oh, absolutely, abso
lutely.  And there were times wh
en my  mo ther would put me to 
bed and she would tie up my  th roat, and she wo
uld put carbolic acid around, because the 
Germans -- that was a smell th
at you used in hospitals, that 
was a smell that you used to 
disinfect.  And they  would come and she wo
uld say krank, meanin
g sick, and she said 
we'll pretend that you're sick.  Period.  And 
if they asked me questions about my  father, 
I knew my father was in Siberia, and th at 
was a positive thing, because obviously if he 
were in Siberia, he was pro-German, and 
we were, you know, just a good Christian 
family whose father had been  taken away by
 the Russians.  Then after the war ended, 
and the Russians came in to liberate us, th
en  my  mo th er said  
now we can 't tell the 
Russians that Daddy is in Siberia.   
Q: So you were about seven then ?   
A: The war ended in '4 5.  I guess, yeah, pr
obably around seven.  
So now we'r e going to 
tell them th at he's  in a concentration camp or
 a labor camp, and that was okay with me.  I 
mean, I was a very good ch ild and I did what
 my mother told me
.  Therewasnota 
question of saying why or, you 
know, there was a war and pe
ople were getting killed, and 
I didn 't want to be killed.   
Q: Do you reme mb er being afraid
 that you would be killed?   

Interview with Elizabeth Strassburger
  
9 
 
   
   
   
   
   
A: Oh, yes, because the bombs were falling, 
and for years afterwards when I saw planes, 
I would expect bombs to come.  Even  wh en 
I was -- you know, after we had left Poland, 
I was very, very scared of bombs and the 
noise and plan es going over, because that's 
what plan es did in Po land during 
the war, they dropped bombs.   
Q: You said that you sp ent some time in th
ebasement.  Wasthat 
when  the bombs were 
falling that you went to the baseme nt?   
A: Sometimes, also sometimes when they were looking for 
Jews, and my  mo ther looked 
very Jewish.  I guess I didn 't, although when
 I talked to Wisia when I did the show 
interview, she told me that 
one of the things she was sup
posed to do was to keep me 
dirty, and so wh en I played outside with a
ll the children, I was always covered with mud 

because I wasn 't blond, and everybody else was 
blond.  And th at was fun, too.  I mean, 
imagine being a little kid and y
our big sister puts mud on yo
u and your mother doesn't 
say anything about it, everybody thinks it's  cool
.  So that was kind of a fun -- fun part.   
Q: So Wisia was nine years older than you?   

A: That's right.   

Q: And she was your best friend?   
A: She was my best friend.   
Q: She lo oked out fo r you?   

A: She looked out for me
,exactly .  Exactly.   
Q: Were there other children in the house?   

Interview with Elizabeth Strassburger
  
10 
 
   
   
   
   
   
A: Some.  Actually, the caretaker who liv
ed  in a little hut near the house, who was 
responsib le for taking care of th
is house, had I thi
nk ten or eleven ch ildren.  There were 
seemed lik e zillions of children, and we all pl
ayed together.  We tried to lead as normal 
lives as possible.  Sometimes w e went
 to school, sometimes we didn't .   
Q: What made the difference whether you went to school or not?   
A: Depending upon what the situation was in
 the neighborhood.  If the Germans were 
coming, then  school was not in session.  If 
we needed  to hide, we hid.  But nobody 
questioned, everybody hi
d, everybody did what they were told.   
Q: And what kind of scho
ol did you go to?   
A: I went to Catholic school with the Sist
ers of St. Ursula, the Grey Ursulines, and I 
finished -- I don't think I even
 finished second grade.   
Q: And did that seem natural to you, 
to be going to a Catholic school?   
A: Well, I was Catholic.  I was Catholic.  Of
 course.  I went to church, and I prayed, 
and I pray ed  that my  father would come hom
e, and I prayed he would be there when I 
went to do my first co mmunion.  And I know 
now that if anything 
had happened to my 
mo ther, that this family would have kept me.   
Q: And you would have stayed?   
A: And I would have stayed, and I woul
d have been a good Catholic girl.   
Q: What else do you remember about that time?   
A: Flowers on the trees, fruit on the trees, you 
know, that we ate.  When the Russians 
came in to liberate us in '45, they came a
nd they took over the house, and they  wouldn't 

Interview with Elizabeth Strassburger
  
11 
 
   
   
   
   
   
allow anybody out.  And we 
had a woman who delivered m
ilk, and sh e had to go and 
deliver milk but they wouldn't 
let her leave, and I remember 
she tied I thought they were 
sheets but it turned out it was 
a rope, and sh e went down the 
rope, through the bathroom 
window, and everybody though
t that was a really intere
sting kind of a place. And I 
remember when the Germans we
re leaving as the Russians were coming, and everybody 
was cheering because they were
 leaving.  And there had be
en some German children in 
the neighborhood that were pretty nasty, a
nd they were fleeing with their families, and 
that was kind of nice, too, because they were
 doing what we had been
 doing, and now we 
were sort of on top and they 
weren't.  And th e Ru ssians were nice, and they  were giving 
us food and stuff.   

Q: The Russians were nice?   

A: Very nice, extremely nice.  They came and 
they liberated -- liberated us, got rid of the 
Germans.  And then we left 
shortly after that.  Now --  
Q: So there was no mistreat
ment from the Russians?   
A: Oh, no, not at that point.  
I mean, we left within a coupl
e of months of when  the war 
ended.  My  mo ther and I were taken by -- Wi
sia's father was apparently in prison, the 
Germans had imprisoned him, and wh en th e Ru
ssians came, he was released.  And so he 
drove us to the Krakow area, 
and my  mo ther put me in a convent and she went looking 
for family, and of course she found no one.   
Q: She put you in a convent?   
A: Right.   

Interview with Elizabeth Strassburger
  
12 
 
   
   
   
   
   
Q: What were the circumst
ances in the convent?   
A: She was -- I was still one of -- I was one 
of the young children,
 and I had to go to  
school.  And th e school was in a convent, an
d this was a different set of nuns, different 
order of nuns.  I don't know 
how you would translate that 
intoEnglish.  Theywere 
called Prezentki, and maybe I can find out.   
Q: Now, were you still being considered a Catholic child?   
A: No.  At that point, when I -- when the 
war ended and the Russians came, my  mother 
told me we're going to tell th
e Russians that Daddy's in a 
German camp, and I want you 
to know that we're not Catholic, that you'
re Jewish.  And I was horrified, because 
I -- you know, I was into the dogm
a, and into the teachings of
 the Catholic church. And I 
went to talk to my priest, and my -- and I sa
id I'm not Catholic, Father, I'm Jewish, will I 
burn in hell?  And he said ye
s, go away.  And that was a pretty horrifying kind of a 
thing, that was pretty awful to
 be told that, because I had be
en -- through no
 fault of my 
own, all of a sudden I had ch anged. Bu t when  
we -- when we left to go to the Krakow 
area and my mother said I'm going to put you 
into school so you 're sa
fe, she's said you're 
still going to have to pretend 
that you're Catholic.   
Q: You were horrified wh
en the priest said -- 
A: Yes, absolutely.   

Q: -- you're going to  burn in  hell?   
A: Of course.   
Q: Did you talk to your mo ther about it?   

Interview with Elizabeth Strassburger
  
13 
 
   
   
   
   
   
A: Yes.  She said well, that
's what they think, but that
's  not wh at we think.   
Q: And then  how did you feel?   
A: I was confused because I hadn't really me t any Jews.  I didn't  know what Jews were 
like.  But before we left M
ilanowek to go to th
e Krakow area again, my mother said 
we're going to go see if we can find any of
 our Jewish relatives, and then you can see 
how nice Jews are.   
Q: When  your mo th er said you're a Jew, what
 did you think th at meant, being a Jew?   
A: It meant that I was the awful person.  You 
have to remember this 
is in the early '40s, 
where the Po lish Catholics thought that the Jews
 had crucified Christ and they  were awful 
people and, you know, there was a lot of
 antisemitism in Po
land.  Youknow,I 
can -- speaking as an adult, I didn't know that
 then, but they were th e bad people.  They 
were the people that the Germ
ans were taking away because they were so bad.   

Q: So you had picked  up th at --  
A: Oh, oh, yes.   
Q: -- from other kids?   

A: Oh, sure, oh, sure.  Yeah.   
Q: And then you were told you were one now?   
A: Right.  It's an awful feeling.   

Q: So when you got back to Krak ow, your moth
er said you had to be in the convent for a 
while?   

A:Yes.   

Interview with Elizabeth Strassburger
  
14 
 
   
   
   
   
   
Q: And how did that feel to you?   
A: Well, my mo ther was looking fo r relatives
.  I was hoping she'd come back with a 
whole lot of relatives,  and we 'd  al l live togeth
er happily every after.  But she never found 
anyrelatives.   
Q: Did she find wh at had happened to the relatives?   

A: After the war there was a book published 
of survivors, and nobody th at she knew was 
in the book, not even 
my father.  So sh e assumed he wa
s dead and she had to make a life 
for herself, but she wasn't going to stay 
in Poland.  There was no point to it.   
So she got us smuggled  out by Russian guard
s in crates of china.  Again, I was 
medicated, and I was put -- china 
was put in there, then I was 
put in there, and then straw 
on top, or maybe the other way 
around, and we went over the 
border to Czechoslovakia.   
Q: Now, how did she arrange the smuggling with the guards?   
A: I don't know.  I don't know.  I assumed she paid th em.  I assume she had money 
saved.   
Q: But she never told  you?   

A: I never asked.  You know, it was somethi
ng you didn't talk a
bout.  Idon'tthinkI 
ever talked to my mother about what ha
d happened until maybe 
when we got to the 

United States, and she was always 
very reluctant to talk.  It 
was not a pretty part of her 
past that she wanted to discuss.  So 
I never really knew.  But we went to 
Czechoslovakia, we lived in the fields.   

Interview with Elizabeth Strassburger
  
15 
 
   
   
   
   
   
Q: Now, before that, did you know that yo
u were going to be drugged and put into a 
crate?   
A: No, but I'd been drugged 
before, and my  mo ther said you're going to  take this 
medication, you're going to  fall asleep, a
nd wh en you wake up, we'll be free.   
Q: And is that what happened?   

A:Yes.   
Q: So you did remain asleep?   
A:Oh,yes.   

Q: The entire time you were in the crate?   
A:Yes.   
Q: Where do you think she got the medication?   

A: She was a pharmacist.   

Q:Oh.   
A: My mo th er was a pharmacist by profession.   
Q: So sh e had access?   

A: Yeah.   
Q: And knew something about dosages?   
A:Yes.   

Q: And so she was in a crate, also?   

Interview with Elizabeth Strassburger
  
16 
 
   
   
   
   
   
A: She was in crate, I was in a crate, and 
there were apparently other people in crates, 
because when I woke up, we were all standing
 and they were all -- there were several of 
us.   
Q: So th e journey was from Krakow to  --  

A:Czechoslovakia.   

Q: Where in Czechoslovakia?   
A: I don't know.  Bu t it was very close to th
e Austrian border, beca
use then we went to 
Austria, and we wound up at a place called --  
Q: So before that, so you woke up 
and you were out of th e crate -- 
A: Right.   

Q: -- when you woke up, and do you rememb er that?   

A: Yes.  Yeah, I remember.  We were in a 
field, and we ate potatoes.  And then we 
started walking, and part of the time my mother carried me and part of the time I walked.  
And we wound up --  
Q: You were with your mo ther and some other people?   

A:Yes.   
Q: Was there a guide with 
you, do you reme mber?   
A: I don't rememb er.  You have
 to rememb er, I was seven years old.  My  mo ther said 
we're walking, we walked.   

Q: And getting over being drugged?   

Interview with Elizabeth Strassburger
  
17 
 
   
   
   
   
   
A: I had been drugged before
.  It was only you were wooz
y fo r a while and you were 
kind of confused, but she was there, and she 
was always there, so whatever she wanted 
was okay with me.  And th en we went to Vienna.   
Q: So you walked from a fi
eld in Czechoslovakia?   
A:Right.  ToVienna.   

Q: You walk ed all the way?   
A: We may not have walked all the way to Vi
enna.  I'd have to look on a map, I guess, to 
see where, but somehow we 
wound up in Vienna.   
Q: And you did a lot of walking?   

A: We did a lot of walking, yes.   
Q: Okay .   

A: And in Vienna they  had a place called th
e Rothschild Hospital, 
which was sort of a 
transition point for people.  I 
remember we slept in a big room with all girls and all 
women, and the men and th e boys slept in 
another room, and we got meals and we got 
clean clothes, and we were sprayed with 
DDT in case we had lice or whatever.   
Q: Do you know who sp
onsored this place?   
A: I think UNRRA.   

Q: Okay .   

A: And we were there for maybe a couple of
 months, I would think, until something was 
arranged for us.  My mother 
was looking for relatives and 
couldn't find anybody.  Bu t 
thinking that my father was d
ead, because he hadn't been in
 the book, either, she decided 

Interview with Elizabeth Strassburger
  
18 
 
   
   
   
   
   
that we would go to  Israel.  And so we join
ed a camp for children in
 Germany, orphaned  
children going to Israel.   
Q: Wait a minute.  You're in Vienna, and your
 mother decided to go
 to Israel.  So how 
did you --  
A: She -- I would assume that UNRRA help
ed her go, you know.  This was just a 
transition point.  People didn't stay there for 
an extended period of
 time in Vienna.   
Q: Do you reme mb er going from
 Vienna to Germany?   
A: Yes, and we went in a truck; I'm pretty su
re we went in a truck.  And we went to a 
camp for Jewish orphans, and th ere were hund
reds of Jewish orphans, and th ere were 
grownups who were taking care of them.  
There were teachers and there were doctors, 
and there were people who did things.   

Q: So your mother was in
 the camp with you?   
A: Yes.  She got a job as a pharmacist, and 
we were going to go to Israel where she 
hoped maybe she had relatives there.  An
d we were in this camp  probably fo r 
about -- from the point we left
 Poland until we went to Ital
y was six months, about, or 
maybe -- maybe less, even.  But we were in th
is camp , and they  were getting ready to get 
a ship to take us to Israel, and a medical 
commi ssion came through the camp  to check the 
camp to make sure that all conditions were 
good. And my mother re
cognized one of the 
docto rs in the commission, and, you know, they
 hugged each other, and he said oh, my  
goodness, you're alive.  And 
she said this is my daughter. 
 We both surv
ived, and my 
husband didn't. And he said oh, no, he's alive; 
he's in Italy.  So  he sent a telegram to

Italy, and the next day an ambul
ance came, because if you're a 
doctor, that's  your mode of 
transportation.  AndImetmyfather.  Iwas 
eight years old, and I met my father for the 
first time.   
Q: Wait a minute.  You were in the camp in Germany?   

A:Uh-huh.   

Q: And your father was in Italy?   
A: Right.   
Q: And so he contacted your father?   

A: Right.   
Q: And then  you and your mo th er went to Italy?   
A:Correct.   

Q: And how did you get from the 
camp in Germany to  Italy?   
A: By ambulance.   
Q: Oh, you went the whole tr
ip from Germany to Italy -- 
A:Yes.   
Q: -- by this ambulance?   
A: Right.   
Q: So he got the ambulance?   

A: Right.   
Q: For you -- 
A:Yes.   

Interview with Elizabeth Strassburger

Q: -- and your mother to travel?   
A: Right.  And he had -- he had been in Sibe
ria, and he said the 
only reason he survived  
was because he was a doctor and they needed hi
m to take care of the prisoners.  And so 
he would get better rations and better clothing,
 even though he lo
st several toes, you 
know, to frostbite.  And then  there was an amnesty in Poland -- in Siberia, and the 

nonpolitical prisoners were allowed to join 
the Polish Army fighting 
with General Anders 
with the Allies, and he joined
 the Army.  They went to 
Egypt and they fought against 
Rommel, and th en they  went to Italy and th
ey fought at Monte Cassino.  And then, you 

know, he obviously  got permission for us to 
come.  And then we were in Italy for six 
months, and then th e Army  went to England.   
Q: You were in Italy for six months?   

A: Right.   

Q: And your father was in the Army?   
A: Right.   
Q: In Italy?   

A: Right.   
Q: Where were you and y
our mother living?   
A: With him.   
Q: He had a house or an apartment?   
A: He had a hut or whatever those things were
 in Italy.  Maybe he had an  apartment.   
Q: So you ju st moved in  with him?   

Interview with Elizabeth Strassburger
  
21 
 
   
   
   
   
   
A:Yes.   
Q: Do you remember that?   
A: Yes.  In fact, I had pictures of that. 
 You know, we'd  go swimming to  the beach, we 
toured --  
Q: We, you and your mo
ther and father?   
A: Oh, yes, oh, yes.  You know, the war wa
s over by that time, and the Army still hadn't 
been demobilized but th
e war was over, so this was a mira
cle that we had su rvived, it was 
a miracle th at he had su rvived.  So I guess th
ere were other people there with families.   
Q: And did he also have to 
wo rk during th is period?   
A: Oh, yes, I mean, he was still -- 

Q: He was work ing?   

A: He was still working, but he got time off.   

Q: So you would sp en
d part of the day with  your mo ther?   
A: Well, I would sp end some -- you know, ther
e was a school I went to.  I was learning 

Italian, I was playing with the Italian children.   

Q: What was the school that you went to?   
A: It was an Army school for children.   
Q: Okay .   

A: Of the people that were still in the Army. 
 And then the Army went to England, and 
my father continued to work as a 
doctor, and everybody had families.   
Q: So your father went to England, 
and you and your mother went also?   

Interview with Elizabeth Strassburger
  
22 
 
   
   
   
   
   
A:Withhim,yes.  Yes.   
Q: And where did you live in England?   
A: In England we lived in a place called 
Bedlington -- no excuse me, Morpeth.  No, 
maybe -- it was a little place between Bedlington
 and Morpeth.  It was called Hartford 
Bridge, and there were all the people that we
re there with the Polis
h Army was there, and 
there I went to English school.  And I went to --  

Q: With English children?   
A: With English children.  And then I passe
d an exam, and I went to grammar school.   
Q: Now, did you know English wh
en you went to England?   
A: No.  No .  Bu t I learned it very , very quickly.   

Q: But you just started 
right off in school?   
A:Yes.  Yes.   

Q: And learned English as
 you went along?   
A:Yes.   

Q: And you were then about eight?   

A: It was -- I can tell y ou, it was December 
of 1946 that we arrived in England.   
Q: So you were about eight?   

A: I was eight.  And what they  did was they a
ssigned an English girl to me in the class, 
and she an d I sat together, we had double de
sks, and she would poin
t at things, and she 
was sort of my  mentor.  And I would point 
to this and she would say table, chair, and 
that 's how we learned.  There was no bilingual education.   

Interview with Elizabeth Strassburger
  
23 
 
   
   
   
   
   
Q: Were there other refugee children in this school?   
A:Yes.  Oh,yes,oh,yes.  Certainly.   
Q: And who were your friends?   
A: The refugee children, and also some of the En
glish children that I went to school with.   

Q: And at this point wh ere was your conf
usion ab out being Catholic or Jewish?   
A: Well, in the German -- in the camp in Ge
rmany I had started learning about Judaism.  
I had trouble with the writing, but I learned the concepts.   

Q: With the Hebrew writing?   

A: With the Hebrew, right.   
Q: Now, wh ere did you learn abou
t this and learn the writing?   
A: In Germany, in the camp for Je
wish orphans where we were.   
Q: There was a school there?   

A:Yes.   
Q: Or this was informal teaching?   
A: Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  It
 was very formal -- it was a ve
ry formal camp.  These were 
children that had lost their parents, they need
ed structure, so we had school, we had play 
time, we w ent on trips.  I saw my first elepha
nt in a zoo there, I rode a horse.  I mean, 
we were -- we were in heaven
, we thought, consid ering what
 we had all gone through in  
terms of deprivation and having lost famili
es and not being ab le 
to eat and being in 
hiding.  They were really worse than I was;
 at least I had one pa
rent.  Youknow,many 
of them had none.   

Interview with Elizabeth Strassburger
  
24 
 
   
   
   
   
   
Q: So in  that camp you were learning some
 Hebrew, and you were with other Jewish 
children?   
A:Yes.   
Q: And how were you feeling 
about it at that point?   
A: Well, we were -- you know, they didn't  have
 horns, you know.  In Po land the concep t 
was the Jews had horns.  They were very ni
ce people.  The adults were very nice.  
Maybe the things I had learned as a child were
 not exactly true, you know, I didn't know.  
But, you know, at the age of seven or eight 
you don't really have to  make decisions; you 
can wait and see what happen
s wh en you grow up.   
Q: So th en when  you got to En
gland, you were in a school that
 was not a Jewish school?   
A: Right.   

Q: And how was that for you?   

A: It was okay.  I mean, that was the third 
religion, it was Church of England, and the 
principal said if we -- spoke to my parents an
d said if I didn't want to attend the services, 
it was okay.  And my  father sa
id no, you know, I want her to
 be exposed to all religions, 
it's okay.  So you know, they
 would have a prayer, and you 
didn't have to pray  if you 
didn't  want to, you co uld just stand and bo
w your head  and say 
your own pray er or 
whatever.   

Q: What had your parents' religious 
practices been before the war?   
A: My father apparently came from an extrem
ely orthodox family.  My grandmother had 
shaved her head and she wore 
a wig.  My  mother came from a very observant family, but 

Interview with Elizabeth Strassburger
  
25 
 
   
   
   
   
   
not to th at extent.  So but they  both ha
d strong traditions.  And they  continued, you 
know, when  we had our own home, they contin
ued.  And Judaism is
 a religion that you 
can practice in any way you want
, to any degree you want, so it's
 very permissive in that 
way.   
Q: So you were going to
 school with the Church of England?   
A:Yes.   
Q: And your parents were observant at home?   
A: To some extent.  We didn't eat pork, you kn
ow, certain things that we didn't do.  Bu t 
when  you'r e in the Army, you can't always do 
ex actly as you want.  We were still in the 
Army.  And then the Army was demobilized
, and then my parents had to make a 
decision as to what they were going to do
.  And my  mo th er had discovered th at her 
mother's sister, her great-aunt, was living in
 the United States, and she was willing to 
bring us to the United States.  So we 
came to the United States in 1951.   
Q: So you had to wa
it several years?   
A:Fiveyears.   

Q: Was that for a quota that you had to wait?   
A:Apparently.  Thenthey 
passed some speci al law that 
allowed us to come to the 
United States as -- you know
, we were stateless, and we were allowed in.  And my 
great-aunt and uncle guaranteed 
th at they would take care of
 us and support us.  And we 
were healthy.   
Q: So you had been in Engl
and for several years?   

Interview with Elizabeth Strassburger
  
26 
 
   
   
   
   
   
A:Fiveyears.   
Q:Fiveyears?   
A: Right.   
Q: In England?   

A: Right.   

Q: In one place, in one school?   
A: No.  I went to -- first I went to elementa
ry school, and th en in
 England wh en you get 
to a certain age, you sit an exam, and if you
 pass it, you go on to -- 
there are two tracks, 
there's a commercial track and th en  there's a 
college track, and if you pass the test, you go 
to a grammar school, it's what's called grammar school.  And I was fortunate that I 
passed.  And so  I went to a school where 
I learned Latin and Fren ch and algebra and 
geometry.  And then when I cam
e to the United States, they 
said oh, you're 13, you're 
going to  8th grad e, and it didn't  matter that 
I'd had Fren ch and Latin and geometry and 
algebra.  And I was bored, very bored.   

Q: So you were academically very 
ahead of American children?   
A: Yes, yes.   
Q: How did you feel about leaving 
your situation in  England?   
A: Well, this was the first time I'd  really 
had a fami ly.  My parents had decided to do 
this.  Mymotherwashap
py, my father was happy.  
They felt there were more 
opportunities in this countr
y, so we came here.   
Q: Were there any things that were hard for you to leave?   

Interview with Elizabeth Strassburger
  
27 
 
   
   
   
   
   
A: Friends.  My friends, the people at sc
hool.  Yeah.  WelikedEngland.  Iliked 
England very mu ch.  Even  the weather was okay.   
Q: So you came to th
e United States?   
A: Yes, we came to Newark, New Jersey.   
Q: Is that where your --  

A: That's w h ere my great-aunt and uncle were
 living.  First we lived with them.   
Q: Do you remember your arri
val in the United States?   
A: Oh, sure.  Came on the Queen Mary.   

Q: And what did you th
ink of the voyage?   
A: It was lovely.  We had wonderful fo
od and we had nice cabins.  There was 
entertainment on the ship.  I mean, I didn't co
me to Ellis Island in 
steerage, I came on the 
Queen Mary.  It was very nice.  And our aunt 
and uncle were there, and they  took us to 
their house.  They had a huge house.  I ha
d never seen a house that big.  Now that I 
look back , it's probably smal
ler than the house I have no
w with my  husband, but, you 
know, it was immense.  There was food and th ere was everything.  And it was 
wonderful.   
Q: So you lived --  
A: We lived in Newark with them briefly, 
and th en my father had to pass his medical 
board s, so he had to go back  to school and, 
you know, kind of take 
a course to sort of 
review things.  And then he passed his boards
, and then because we 
weren't citizens, he 
couldn't practice in either New York  or New Je
rsey, so he was offere
d a chance to work 

Interview with Elizabeth Strassburger
  
28 
 
   
   
   
   
   
in Maryland.  And so he came 
to Maryland a year ahead of 
us, because I was in my last 
year of high school and they didn't want to
 move me again, you know, I'd been moving 
around so  mu ch.  And so in 1955, we moved to Mary land.   
Q: How was high school for you as --  

A: It was simple.  It was very simple.  In f
act, what I did, I went to two summer sessions 
and I repeated the stuff that I had taken in 
England, and at least I did it for six weeks 
instead of, you know, six mont
hs.  So I graduated in three and a half years.   
Q: How was it as far as making friends?   

A: Well, I was a rarity , I had an English acce
nt and I had, you know, a different life than 
they had had.  They  had lived 
in one place.  They  had had fri
ends in one place, and, you 
know, I was sort of different, so I made a 
lot of friends.  It was kind of nice.   
Q: And did you have 
refugee friends?   
A:No.  No.  No,welivedwith
 my aunt and uncle, and then
 we had our own apartment.   
Then  wh en my  father was studying and th en he
 had to  pass the boards and he had to do 
an internship for a year, and 
my mother worked.  
My mother worked to
 support us, and I 
did the housework.  So  everybody had their own 
jobs.  So I really didn't  have that much 
time.  I'm sure there were refugees in Ne
wark, but I mean you didn't walk around and 
say are you a refugee.  My mother had fri
ends from where she wo
rked.  Mymother 
worked in a bakery an
d my father was away for part of the time because he had an 
internship in Bay
onne, New Jersey, wh ich was nearby, a
nd then we went to Maryland.   
Q: And your mo ther or your father, did they
 have any refugee or survivor friends?   

Interview with Elizabeth Strassburger
  
29 
 
   
   
   
   
   
A: My mother found cousins th at were here, and then she fo
und her best friend, who was 
living in  Brooklyn, someone with whom sh
e had gone to school 
in kinderg arten and 
elementary school, and they we
re overwhelmed that they had 
foundeachother.  Andthis 
friend had a daughter exactly my  age, one
 month younger, and we'v e been friends now 
since 1951, and we still mainta
in a friendship, which is ki
nd of nice.  Even when we 
don't see each other, we still ha
ve history together, you know, that we can pick up as we 
go.   
Q: Did you know her?   

A:No.   
Q: Before you came to the states?   
A: No.  No , she had been in hiding, also, and 
they came to the Unit
ed States earlier, and 
her father had been killed, also -- had 
been killed, you know
, in the war.   
Q: So you moved to  Maryland?   
A: Right.   
Q: With your father?   

A: Right.   
Q: To this area?   
A: We lived in Carroll County, and my father 
was a psychiatrist in a mental hospital. We 
had a house on the grounds.  And unfortu
nately, he died in 1960.  So --  
Q: He was fairly young?   

Interview with Elizabeth Strassburger
  
30 
 
   
   
   
   
   
A: He was 60 years old.  My  mother was 48
 when  he died.  And so he died, and my  
mother decided to go to New Yo
rk because the house where she 
lived came with the job.  
And so with in six months she had to vacate th
e house. So she came to
 -- she went back to 
New Jersey to her friends at the bakery, and sh
e got a job at the bakery again.  And I was 
married two years later, so I stayed
 in Mary land with my husband.   
Q: Now, when your father died, were
 you living with your parents?   
A:Yes.  Yes.   

Q: So you had to leav
e the house, also?   
A:Oh,yes.  Oh,ofcourse.   
Q: So in  1960, you wo
uld have been 22?   
A:Correct.  Yeah.   

Q: We're missing a space here.  You graduated from high school?   

A: Oh, I'm sorry.  Oh, 
and then I came to Maryland, and 
I went to college, I went to the 
University of Maryland.   

Q: Okay .   

A: And then I graduated from Maryland in Fe
bruary of 1959, and I got a job wo rking at 
the hospital.  And then I went to graduate sc
hool for a year.  I was training as a social 
worker, and then my father di
ed.  And the hospital had -- they
 gave me a stipend, wh ich 
meant they paid me a full salary while I went
 to graduate school.  I worked for three 

days a week  and I went to school tw o days a 
week, to graduate school at University of 
Pennsylv ania, and any holid ays that I had fro
m school, I had to wo rk.  And then wh en 

Interview with Elizabeth Strassburger
  
31 
 
   
   
   
   
   
school was over in -- no, excuse
me.  Thenwhenmyfather
 died, I owed the hospital a 
year of my  life, you know, I had to pay back
 essentially by work ing, and so they  -- I 
decided since I was getting married anyway , that
 I would drop out of graduate school and 
I would pay them back the yea
r, because in case my  husband
 got transferred somewhere, 
then I would want to go with him.  So by 
then it was -- we were married in 1961, and we 
lived in Maryland, and my husband worked for the National 
Bureau of Standards, and I 
finished graduate school.  And then I had 
a car accident where I broke my neck, so I 
was --

pe number one, side B.   
Q: When the tape was cut off, you were talk
ing about moving to Syracuse with your 
husband.   

A: Right.   

Q: And your two children 
were born there?   
A: Right.  But prior to moving
 to Syracuse, I did 
even tually go back to graduate school, 
and I did get a master's degree in social wo
rk.  And I worked fo
r almost a year for 
Montgomery Co unty, and th en we went to 
Syracuse, and my  two children were born 
there, and I went back to work as a social 
worker.  Andafterbeing 
in Syracuse for about 

Interview with Elizabeth Strassburger
  
32 
 
   
   
   
   
   
eight years, we moved back to th e Maryland
 area, and we'v e been here ever since.  
That's  been since 1970.   
Q: Was your husband a survivor?   
A: My husband came here at the age of 2. 
 He was brought over here by relatives from 
Pittsburgh, but -- and he was bor
n in Germany, but he came he
re before the war actually 
started.  So even  though technically by our mu
seum standard s he is a survivor, he doesn't 
feel that way because he really doesn 't re
member anything that 
happenedprior.   
Q: How do you think all of your
 experiences as a child affect
ed your subsequent life?   
A: You know, I never thought about it very mu
ch, because it really wa
sn't the "in" thing 
when  I was growing up.  People didn't  talk 
about the war, and people didn't talk about 
the atrocities and whatnot.  And I guess it 
was not until maybe the mid '70s when a 
friend of one of my  friends with  whom I wo
rked was writing a book about children of the 
Holo caust, and my  friend Jo an said would you 
talk to Ina, Ina Frie
dman.  Andthebook 
is called Escape or Die.  And she said wo
uld you talk to her, 
because she's really 
interested in your background.  And I had to 
talk to my mother, b
ecause I couldn't really 
put my  finger on things, and my  mo ther didn't really want to talk about it.  But I did 
remember, and so I talked to 
In a, and In a wrote the book.  And the tapes of that are at 
Yad Vash em, and then she sent me the book. 
 And I don't know if my  story was all that 
interesting, but I was very organized, beca
use the way she's written it is pretty much 
exactly what I said to her.  
And th en I continued wo rking.  My children grew up, and 
my  daughter is married.  She's a physician an
d she's married to a physician.  And my  

Interview with Elizabeth Strassburger
  
33 
 
   
   
   
   
   
son is visiting me now, and he's in the mu sic fi
eld.  I've been married for 36 years to the 
same man, which is kindof 
nice.  And in 1994 I retired 
from my  job with Montgomery 
County.  I had been a therapis
t with emotionally disturbed ch
ildren, and I went to work 
as a volunteer.  And it's very, very meaningf
ul for me to work as a volunteer, because I 
feel I survived, and so I have to give back. 
 And I work in the Department of Collections, 
which I think is the best departme nt in the whole mu seum.   
Q: Why do you think th at's the best?   
A: Because the people are just 
the most giving, caring, talent
ed people I have ever met, 
and they 're so dedicated.  And my  boss, Susie 
Goldstein, is just a 
gem.  She'sayoung 
woman, she's my daughter's age, but she's so 
brilliant in terms of what she knows.  And 
we collect artifacts, you know, we get them 
from people, and we catalog them.  And a 
lot of the things are Polish documents and 
Polish postcards and Po lish diaries, and I 
translate th ose because my Polis h is still pretty good
.  I speak well, and I read well, but 
my writing is atrocious, because, as I said, 
I o n ly went through second grade.  And I 
think I'll w o rk at the Holocaust
 Museum until they carry me out
, because it's just a very, 
very nice thing to do.   
Q: How did you decide that you would like to work  there?   
A: I think once the mu seum opened and wh en I 
stopped work ing, I knew that I wanted to  
do so mething, and I wanted to do volunteer work
, and this seemed to be just the right 
thing to do.   

Q: And is mo st of your wo rk there translating?   

Interview with Elizabeth Strassburger
  
34 
 
   
   
   
   
   
A: I translate, I type, I file.  I do whatever, 
whatever they ask me to do, but my primary 
job is translating.   
Q: And how mu ch time do 
youspendthere?   
A: At this point I'm going on
e day a week, but when it gets
 warmer I think I will go two 
days a week .  And now we survivor volunteer
s are going to be in volved  with the Kovno 
Exhibit.   
Q: With the what?   
A: Kovno.   

Q: What is that?   
A: Kovno is the Jewish ghetto
 in Lithuania.  The exhibit is opening the 19th and 20th, I 
believe, or the 20th and 21st of Novemb er, a
nd we're going to be in
volved in  making sure 
that the survivors of the ghe
tto get to the museum and th
e busses take them, and then 
have a hospitality suite that we
're g o ing to have for them.  
There were a lot of survivors 
apparently  that are coming to this exhibit.   
Q: And this project is being don
e, did you say, by the surv ivor 
volunteers a t the museum?   
A: Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.  
We 'r e going to be just helping.  Oh , no, this has been a 
several-year project that's been going on.   

Q: So th e survivor volunteer group at the mu seum -- 

A: Right.   
Q: -- is esp ecially active -- 
A:  Yes.

Q: -- in this project?   
A: Yes.  We're going to be th e hosts and 
hostesses that are going to be welcoming the 
survivors of the Kovno ghetto.  And it's just 
for the opening, it's  just going to be for the 
two days of the opening.   

Q: Could you say so mething ab out the survivor
 volunteers as a group at the mu seum?   
A: Yes.  We started meeting with Martin 
Go ldman, who is a gem, and we're discussing 
issues, things that concern us and the thin
gs that we'd  like to see happening in  the 
museum.  I guess we'd like to have a little b it 
of a voice in what's
 goingon, because once 
we go, you're not going to get any more surv
ivor volunteers, we're it, we're the end.   
And that's the other group that's  so very  dedi
cated, that I am so impressed with, is how 

dedicated th e people are, and you know, we 
talk and we're kind of
 a support group to 
each other, which is ki
nd of nice, too.   
Q: So you're a group within a group?   
A:Yes.  Yes.   
Q: Are there other survivor volunteers 
in the collections department?   
A: Yes.  Yes, there's -- we come on differe
nt days, so I don't really know th em, but 
there's a woman who translates French, and th
ere's another woman wh
o translates Polish, 
and she goes to the Linthicum, which is th
e warehouse for the collections department 
where we have a lot of the artifacts there, too,
 and she translates.  She just doesn 't like to 
come downtown, so she prefer
s to go to Linthicum.   
Q: So you have a lot of feelings 
about your work with
 th e mu seu m?   

Interview with Elizabeth Strassburger
  
36 
 
   
   
   
   
   
A:Oh,yes.   
Q: And the museum itself?   
A: Oh, yes.  I think it's a wonderfu
l thing.  It's very special.   
Q: What about in your pers
onal social life?  Are you in
volvedwithsurvivors?   
A: Not really.  I don't know any survivors. 
 You know, my  friends 
are from my work or 
my  husband's work.  We play bridge.  We pl
ay bridge with the same six couples for 25 
years, we play duplicate bridge, we meet at 
each other's homes, and 
we're sort of a tight 
group. And then I have friends from my early  
days, from college, and a lot of my sorority 
sisters are living in this area.
  And in fact it's  kind of 
cute, but one of the young women 
in the collections department 
is a sorority sister, youknow, 
30 years apart, but still we 
laugh about it that we were 
in sorority together.   
Q: So your friends 
are mostly not --  
A: Right.   

Q: -- survivors?   
A: Right.  I mean, I don't -- if they happen to 
be surviv ors, that's fi
ne, but I don't think I 
look for survivors.  Most 
of the survivors that I've 
met are at the museum.   
Q: And do you see people that you work  with
 at the mu seum outside of the mu seum?   
A: Not really, but we'r e going to
 because we're going to have 
to plan all these things for 
the opening of Kovno, so we're going to be
 getting together as a group and discussing 
how we're going to  do these things.

Q: And what about being Jewish
?  The last we talked ab out 
that in the interview, you 
were still a child.  What ha
ppened to that
 confusion? 
A: Well, I'm very -- I'm Jewish.  I'm Jewish
.  I get -- I still get a fuzzy, nice fuzzy 
feeling wh en I go into a church, and I've gon
e to weddings and I'm very comfortable in a 
Catholic church.  But I'm Jewish and my  
children are Jewish and my son-in-law is 
Jewish.  Wh enmy daughterwa
s married, I h ad no family at
 the wedding, obviously , so I 
really main tain my husband's 
family.  He comes from a very 
large family with lots of 
cousins and aunts and uncles, and I maintain
 that relationship.  And my  daughter's 
in-laws are really fantastic people.  Their 
name's Hersk o witz, and they'v e sorted of 
adopted me so I feel like I do have a family
, which is very impor
tant.  AndIwonder 
what would have happened if there had been  
no war and if I had lived in my  coco on in 
Poland.  My parents came from well-to-do famili
es.  We had lots of servants.  We had, 
you know, everything that 
we could desire, and we lost everything.   
Q: What do you imagine would have happened?   
A: I guess we would have stayed there.  My
 father was, you know
, a physician in the 
spa.  Probab lywouldhavetraveled,probab ly
 would have gone skiing in Switzerland or 
whatever, and I wouldn't have had these expe
riences, so  I guess ever
ything happens for a 
reason.  But my mother was a very strong 
woman, obviously, because she saved us, and 
my  mo ther always said if you have something,
 if you have money or whatever, you need  
to spend it, because if you do
n't, the devil comes and takes 
it.  Soyoureallyneedto 
enjoy if you have things.

Q: And have you lived by th at?   
A: Yes.  Yes.  You know, we like to travel, 
and we go skiing a lot, and we have a good 
time.   

Q: And what about your Jewish religion as
 far as involvement in a synagogue or 

observance of holidays?   

A: We observe all the holidays, and if Elle
n, my  daughter's mo ther-in-law, does Rosh 
Hosh ana, then I do Passover, or vice versa.  We
 do a lot of things together.  That's very 

important because it's family
, you know, it's more than ju
st observing a holiday , it's  
family.  You don't have to go
 to synagogue, you can just 
feel it in your heart.   
Q: So th at has evolved for you?   

A:Yes.   

Q: Into something meaningful?   

A:Yes.   
Q: And what about having children? 
 Wh at was that like for you?   
A: Well, my children were luck
ier than I was.  They had tw
o parents all the time. Even 
when  we moved, they  had two parents.  You 
know, they're very, very  nice young people, 
so I guess we'v e done a good job.   
Q: What --  

A: I'm looking fo rward to grandchildren someday.

Q: What was it like for you wh en your child
ren were the age that you were when you 
were in the ghetto and in  hiding, and th ey we
re having a life very different from the life 
that you had?   
A: I didn't -- you know, I didn't even think 
about it.  Having children was such a special 
miraculous kind of a thing, and watching th
em grow and do all the things, and taking 
pictures of them and just enj
oying everything they did.  I di
d -- you know, I didn't really 
compare.  Youknow,theywe
nt to Hebrew school and th
ey had Bar and Bat Mitzvahs, 
and they  grew up to be nice people.  That's  th
e mo st important thing.  The past is sort of 
a prelude to the future, I guess.  You can't 
dwell on it because you can't undo it, you can't 
do anything about it.  I think it's made me a 
stronger person, but if I could ch ange it, I 

would have rather not had 
that kind of a past.   
Q: What have I not asked 
you th at I should have?   
A: I don't know.  You're very thorough.  I don't know.   
Q: Is there anything else that you would lik
e to say or anything el
se you would like to 
talkabout?   
A: No, I guess I would just enc
ourage people to come
 to the museum, be
cause it's a very 
specialplace.   

Q: Okay.  Well, thank you 
very  mu ch for your contri
bution and for giving your 
testimony today.   
A: Thank you.
