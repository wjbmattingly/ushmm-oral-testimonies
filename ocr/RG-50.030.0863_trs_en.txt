father was a physician, and he practiced in 
Vienna
. He graduated from Univ ersity 
of 
Vienna
 Medical School. Bu t both my  
parents were originally from 
Poland
, 
which explains a little bit why 
my brother and I had to come separately, because we 
were Viennese born, wh ich was one q
uota system. Polish born was a whole 
different quota system.

A: What part of 
Poland
? That Œ it was more than one
 town, but the one that my 
mother was from, and talked about th
e mo st was, if I pronounce this, 
Przemy
˚
l
. 
Q: 
Przemy
˚
l
. 
A: 
Przemy
˚
l
. 
Q: Okay . 
A: But they also had a lumber
 mill, which I believe was in 
Ka to wice
. This was her 
parents. 
Q: Her parents, okay. Did shehave brothers and sisters? 
A: Yes, she did. Sh e had two brothers, 
one sister. My father had brothers and 

sisters. I know less about his family th
an I do about my  mo ther™s, because she 
talked more Œ 

Q: Okay . 

A: Œ you know, about her history. 

Q: Did th ese Œ did th ese brothers and sisters remain in 
Poland
?

Q: Okay . 
A: There was one surviving member of
 my mother™s fa
mily, my cousin 
George
, 
who at that time was 
Ludzic
(ph) 
Saltman
(ph), who was interviewed by the 
mu seum, and wrote a book, and you know, it 
Œ it™s easy to research him. He went 

through camp s from the time he was 12 to  the time he was 17. 

Q: Oh my. 

A: And when my  mo ther heard th at he 
had survived , of course, you know, she 
brought him over. On my  father™s side, his brother surviv ed, because he went in to
 
Russia
 with  the Red Army. 
Q: I see. 

A: But his wife and 18 
month old baby did not. Th
e baby was lost, because 
apparently  they had arranged with  Ch ristia
n neighbors to take the baby, and could 
never find the neighbors, never f
ound the baby. So , big question mark. 
Q: Oh. 

A: And he would have been 
too young to know his name 
or background, if he had 
survived.  
Q: Yeah. 
A: But those were the only surv ivors of
 what were rather large families. 
Q: I me Œ I mean, huge, huge, as
 far as losses go, just huge.

A: Yes. 
Q: And it also illustrates just how much on
 the edge your situation was. That is, 
your parents™ situation and 
your own, how close your 
nuclear family was to the 
same fate. 

A: Oh, of course.  

Q: Yeah. 

A: My cousin 
George™s
 family and mine had many, 
many similarities, and it could 
have Œ 
George™s 
story could have been my  story, 
and his Œ you know. I mean it did 
Œ we were the Œ the same type of people, th
e same type of family, and th  Œ it™s just 
fate. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Do you want to h
ear more about life in 
Vienna
, or Œ 
Q: Yes, I do, I do. 

A: Remember that I was four years old. 
Q: Yes, I know. 
A: So my memory is a 
little hazy. I™m going to tell 
you so me things that I do 
remember. 
Q: Please. 
A: But they may be colored by th ings that my parents told me.

Q: I understand. 
A: So I don™t know if everythi
ng is really clear a memory. 
Q: All right. 
A: I do remember the Nazis coming in. 
Q: Okay . 

A: I remember my father and brother, who wa
s nine at the time, and my  mo ther too, 
of course, avidly  listening to th e radio and 
Hitler
 shouting, but I didn™t necessarily 
understand what he said, I just knew he 
was a bad man, shouting all the time. O n  

Kristallnacht
, the morning after, my 
father took me for a walk, and we saw the 
broken glass, and the broken store window
s, and I knew it was very sad, but I did 
not entirely understand what had happene
d. But I do want to tell you something 
about 
Kristallnacht
, because Œ 
Q: Yeah, do tell me. 
A: Œ it was Œ you know, they said it was a 
spontaneous outpouring 
of rage, and that 
is simply not true, it was pr
eplanned. My father had a patient, we don™t know who it 

was, my father never knew, who was apparen
tly very  high up in the Nazi party. And 
very often a Nazi had a favor
 due. And the day before 
Kristallnacht
, th-the day 
before, my father got an anonymous phon
e call that said, stay at home, you and 
your wife, don™t leave the apartment tomorro w. Stay at home. And of course that 

 
Interv iew with Erika  Tama r

day was the day wh en  they were yanking Je
wish men off the street, and arresting 
them, and humiliating Jewish women, and 
making them wash the sidewalks with 
toothbrushes, but my  father had that really
 strange protection, 
and he didn™t know 
from whom, but getting in a call like that Œ 
Q: Of course. 

A: Œ he, you know, pa
id attention to it. 
Q: And it does tell you it™s preplanned. 
A: Oh yeah. 
Q: Ye-Yeah Œ 

A: I mean, it Œ 
Q: It tells you, yeah. 
A: Of course, because whoever made the 
call knew the day before that it was going 
to happen, exactly what
 was going to happen. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: So I think that™s historically interesti
ng. But that™s less in
 my  me mo ry , and  mo re 
my  parents™ story. 
Q: Yeah. No w, do you Œ your father takes yo
u out the next day, and you™re a four 
year old girl. 

A: I don™t know if it was the next day.

Q: Okay , but Œ 
A: I Œ 

Q: Œ he takes you out soon after. 
A: We took a walk, and there was a lot of broken store windows. Wh ether it was the 
next day or not, I really don™t know. 

Q: Okay . 

A: But I do remember that, I do, taking a wa
lk with him, and a Œ a sense of sadness, 
even if I didn™t know exactly why. 

Q: But did you also have a se
nse of fear, or Œ or not? 

A: I did. Not all the time, and not in te
rms of broken shop windows. Where my  
sense of fear showed  itself Œ and I don™t 
rememb er any other incidents where I was 
really afraid, because I was 
very secure in my family
, and I was very young. My 
mother sent me to the bakery, which was in
 our building, so it wasn™t very far for 
me to go, to pick up some bread, and I we
nt, and there was a soldier with the big, 
black boots, and I forgot about asking 
for the bread, and I ran home. And my  
mo ther asked me what had happen ed, I sa
id there was a Nazi soldier and I was 

afraid he was going to a
rrest me, so I ran home. 
Q: Oh. Okay .

A: Now, part of that is cl
earer memory of mine, part of
 it is my mother™s memory, 
so Œ 
Q: I understand. 
A: Œ everything I™m telli
ng you is a little bit mixed. 
Q: Well, I Œ I Œ I appreciate that you™re
 making those Œ those comments, because Œ 
because it™s important. It™s important for us
 to realize when so
meone is relating an 
episode, how mu ch of it is direct memo ry, 
and how much of it can be influenced by 

what you™re told. 
A: Right. The direct memories, I reme
mb er feeling afraid and running home. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: The conversation with my 
mother afterwards of what I was afraid of, I don™t 
remember, that Œ that™s my Œ 

Q: That was told, yeah. 

A: That was told to me. 
Q: Yeah, yeah. Describe y
our home a little bit, in 
Vienna
. What did it look like? 
Were you in apartment buildi
ng, or single family house? 
A: It was an apartment. I don™t rememb er 
details. There was a park across the street. 
In the summertime before Œ y-you know, 
when life was good and prosperous, we 
usually went away somewhere in 
the country in 
the summertime.

Q: Mm-hm. And Œ and you had one
 sibling, an older brother? 
A: I had an older brother. 
Q: What was his name ? 
A: 
Henry Œ Hein Œ 
in German, 
Heinzie
(ph). 
Q: Okay . 
A: But when he came to the 
United States
, 
Heinz
 became 
Henry
. He was, when 
we left, I w as going on five, he was nine. 
Q: Okay . 
A: And I think the only reason the 
Krauses
(ph) could take me, because I was so 
young, is because I would be tr
aveling with an older sibling. 
Q: I see. 

A: Alone, I think I would ha
ve just been too young. 
Q: I see. A-And wh at language did you speak at home? 

A: German. 
Q: German? Uh-huh. 
A: If my parents didn™t want us to un
derstand something, wh
ich went on fo rever, 
they spoke Polish. 
Q: Okay . 
A: But I didn™t understand Po lish, we spoke German.

A: No. 

Q: Okay .

might have. But my  parents were very 
assimilated . 

Q: That™s what I was su Œ that™s what it su
ggested, is that Œ th

been Œ were you a religious family? 
A: No. 
Q: Okay . 

A: Not religious at all, definitely secula

was young, but you know later, I mean, 
there Œ there was a sen se of bei
ng part of the Jewish nation Œ 

Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ if not the religion. 
Q: Got it. And I get the impression also that since your father went to 
Vienna
 to go 
to medical school, he mu st have come from 
a family that could have afford to send 
him there. 

A: I™m not sure of that.

Q: Okay . 
A: I don™t think so. I Œ I don™t think he 
came from wealth. I think his father might 
have been a grocer. He spoke mu ch less 
about his background and his family. My 
mo ther seemed to come from a Œ happier 
circumstances, and talked a lot about her 

family. 

Q: Was her family well-to-do? 

A: I™m sorry? 
Q: Was her family well-to-do? 
A: Comparatively, yes, b
ecause they owned a sawmill. 
Q: A sawmill, that™s right. 
A: I don™t know how well-to-do that is, but 
they were a more pr
ominent family than 
my father™s family. 
Q: Okay. Were either of 
your parents storytellers?

A: She to ld wonderful stories, and my  oldest
 son is a historian and had tried so hard 
to tape her stories, and the minute he put a mi crophone in  front of her, or had a tape 
running, she froze. 
Q: Oh, th at happens 
with so many people. 
A: So, you know Œ 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Yes, she was a great storyteller and she made her life in 
Poland
 and her life in 
Vienna
 very  vivid for all of us. 
Q: Uh-huh. And wh at kind Œ do you rememb
er any particular stories she told you 
about her own ch ildhood, he

A: Yeah, a lot of stories. 

Q: Okay .

Q: Yeah, that™s okay. 
A: Œ back  in 
Poland
. 
Q: That™s okay. 
A: Because they lived 
in a small town, she was boarded  
out to go to school to get a 
better education, wh ich she hated. And at some point her father gave her a violin. I 

don™t think my  mo ther was mu sical, but he

the maid in the house that she was living 
in  got angry about something, took the 
violin and smashed it. Not even  angry at my  mo ther, she was just Œ 
Q: Angry. 
A: Œ had an argument with s-somebody 
else, and this was the object that she 
smashed. I also know th at my  mo
ther hated being away  from home. 
Q: Did she? 
A: You know, sh-she was young, she wa
s maybe nine, 10, I™m not sure, and she 
really didn™t like being away from home. My 
mother™s father, for that time and that 
period, was, I think something of an orig
in al. My mo ther was very bright, and did 
well in school, and he appreciated that, a
nd he was interested in furthering her 
education, even over th
e sons in the family. 
Q: Wow. 
A: You know, though sh e was a girl Œ 

Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ she had Œ he felt she had promise, and 
he was very interested in furthering her 
education. Which is, I think for that
 time period was a little bit unusual. 
Q: Yeah, I would agree, I would agree. 
Did you ev er visit your grandparents in 

Poland

following year I was going 
to, but then of course everything chan ged wh en 
Hitler
 
came in.  
Q: Yeah. 
A: I will tell you that my mother, when 
she sent us, heard from the Polish family, 
and they  said, how can you do this? How ca
n you send your ch ildren away? He just 
wants German speaking lands. Co me home to 
Poland
. 
Q: Oh my. Oh my. 

A: But my mother was in 
Vienna
 and had a different picture of wh at was 
happening. 
Q: Yeah, yeah. 
A: It was today 
Germ any
, tomo rrow th e world, and sh
e took that seriously. I do 
remember seeing the 
Hitlerjugend
, the girls Œ 
Q: Did you Œ 
A: Œ marching down  the street
 with, you know, pretty blon
de braids, teenagers, and 
I thought they looked
 so wonderful and I so admire
d them. And I told my mother, 
when I™m a teenager, 
I want to join the 
Hitlerjugend
 girls, and my  mo ther 
explained that I couldn™t. But when I came to the 
United States

Girl Scouts.

authorities, the Œ the Nazi 
authorities that took over? 
A: I really Œ I Œ you know, I was sheltered

the country who came to live with us and became 
one of the family and I loved her, a
nd I know she loved me. And during the

 from the country and take

didn™t want to leave their jobs, they Œ none
 of this is true. They wanted to leave, 
there was no place to go. Every border cl

 self-interest, feeling they were ed Œ

she was ma ybe nine or 10, 
and she and a bunch of othe
r eight, nine, 10 year old 
little girls sort of took over caring for me,

and when  we talked

her only memo ry of my  brother was, he was this hand Œ 

Q: Okay .

sometimes I really embarrassed him because 
sometimes I didn™t see him, and I had

So he Œ he wrote home that some times it 
was embarrassing. In terms of taking care

comparative stranger, yes. Actually so
mebody Œ a Christian who worked for 
Sears 
Roebuck

he wasn™t well positioned enough, he wasn™t

A: There was a young woman, I think quite young, from 
Chicago
, an American, 
traveling from 
Germany
 with her birds. She went by 
ship  because she ha Œ sh e was 
bringing birds home. She was an 
American, but she had lived in 
Germany
 for a 
while. On e day on deck  I was swamped by 
a wave, and my  leggings, or whatever I 
wore, were soaked, and I was just standing
 there by my self helplessly, and I didn™t 
know wh at to do. And this young woman 
saw me, and took me to her stateroom, 
and got me out of my  wet 
leggings and gave me something dry to  wear. And I 
remember a stateroom full of colorful birds. 
Now, this is a four year old™s memo ry. 
It™s perfectly possible that there were three 
birds. I just remember all these birds, ma 
Œ I have no idea. And I believe she spoke 
German, so Œ because she had lived  in 

Germany
, so we communicated easily. And now he
re™s the mystery. I slept in her 
stateroom, and I don™t know how that came 
to  be, whether she talked to the people 

 
Interv iew with Erika  Tama r

who were superv ising me, or if
 sh e just had me there. I 
know I spent time there, and 
I do know I slept there at least once, and 
that it wasn™t my imagination because she 
sent a letter to my mother, 
she got my  mo ther™s address. She put me to sleep, and 
she says, sweet dreams, and I said, I™m goi
ng to dream about 
my  mo th er. And  sh e 
wrote that to my mother. So that clarifies that I really 
did sleep in her stateroom.

Q: Okay. Do you have a me
mory of arriving in the 
United Sta tes
? 
A: The immediate arrival, no, no.  

Q: Okay . What would be your next memo ry? 

A: The camp. The Œ in Œ there 
was a summer camp  outside of 
Philadelphia
 where 
we were kept. And from there we were supp
osed to go to foster care. What I do 
remember, both onboard ship, and also 
in  th e su mmer ca mp , 
there was a real 
difference, there were the kids who were go
ing to relatives, and the kids who had no 
one, and who were going to  foster care. A
nd the kids who were going to relatives 
were the lucky ones. 

Q: Yes. 

A: All right now, here™s a me
mo ry which may not be true. 
Q: Okay . 
A: I do rememb er people coming to look us 
over, who were potential foster parents. 
I do Œ that is true, but I do also rememb er
 th at they looked at us through a wire 
fence. Whether Œ that seems strange, 
but that™s my memo

A: I™m not, I Œ this is what I remember, but 
as a grownup, I think, wouldn™t that be 
strange, to have children on one side of a wire fence, and the people Œ 
Q: Right. 
A: Œ looking them over on the other side? I 
don™t Œ but I reme mb er this wire fence, 
but it could be that I imagined it, I don™t 
know. I think I did get that awful sense of 
being looked over, so maybe I translated into 
being like an animal in a zoo, with the 
wire fence. Whether there was a wire fence or not, I can™t tell you. 

Q: Got it. 

A: I do know that I was very, very angr
y at being looked over. I felt it very 
extremely, and because of that I wouldn™t
 talk, and I wouldn™t 
smile, and you know, 
I was Œ my  brother recognized the importance 
of finding foster family, so he was all 
charm and smiles and showing his intelligen

brother, and who 
wanted this angry little girl? 
Q: Yeah. 

A: The camp was not winterized, they had to 
get rid of all of these kids Œ I Œ I don™t 
mean get rid in a bad way Œ 
Q: They had to Œ yeah.

A: Œ but they needed a plac
e for these kids to go. And they couldn™t publicize us 
that much, because the id
ea of 50 Jewish children being brought to the 
States
 
wasn™t that popular. So they had to do th
ings a little quietly. So on one hand they 
needed foster care for us, but it was di
fficult for them. And when  people kept 
wanting my brother, they thought it might be
 harder to place two 
children, and they 
were going to separate us. And that is when
 my  brother came into his full nine year 
old powers, and abso lutely 
refused, and you know, then
 when  someone wanted to 
take him, like if I don™t go with  my  sist
er, I™m going to make your life miserable. 
You won™t want me in your house. You know,
 so Œ and he also adamantly spoke to 
whoever, that he Œ my parents were prom
ised that we will be together, that Œ 
whether that Œ they were or not, I don™t know,
 but also that he was going to be with 
his sister, he was going to take care of me, w e were not to be separated. And really, 
I do remember him ma king a scene with 
someone who wanted him, but wasn™t 
going to  take me. 
Q: Amazing. 
A: And you know, when  he got thro ugh, th
ey didn™t want him any more. If I had 
been separated, I would have been  emotiona
lly devastated. It would Œ I™d have been 
traumatized  beyond belief. Because we weren™

burden, an d I didn™t, because I had my  brother.

went to school where he had a teacher that

A: There was a great deal of trouble, my 
father had signed up early, finally his 
number came up. The Œ I looked it up on the 
internet to find what
 ship they were 
passengers on, and th ey apparently sailed from 
Antwerp
. 
Q: Okay . 
A: I always thought 
Lisbon

Lisbon
 to  
Antwerp

had really always believed they  sailed from 
Lisbon
, but they sailed from 
Antwerp

Q: Okay . 
A: And I guess their number came

had their numb er come up in

Where was this apartment? 
A: 
Woodside

Q: 
Queens

 Queens

s in that apar

did you have your own apartm

A: No, we had our own apartment. My 
parents had their furniture shipped long 
before they came. It was possible to ship
 fu rniture, you couldn™
t take money out, 
but you could ship fu rniture. And a Œ ye
ars after, you know, my  mother would see 
things in antique stores, and think oh, this
 is, you know Jewish furniture that was 
shipped, wh ere the owners never came. Wh
ich I™m sure happen
ed . B u t y e ah , th ey  
shipped furn iture, and 
Woodside
 wasn™t too long, it was th
e first apartment, at I™m 
sure a low rent, because we had no money 
to speak of. My fath

the tests to be licensed as a physician again.

A: But there was a degree of camaraderie
, because there was a whole bunch of 
doctors that had come from 
Vienna
, in 
Brooklyn
, in 
Qu een s
, the family, friends. 
And they all gave each other courage, a
nd if somebody failed the test, all the men 
got together and said, you ha
ve to take it again. Actua
lly, the first group of men 
who took the licensing exam failed, becaus
e there were yes and no answers. There 
was a question to wh ich you should  say, true
, false, yes, no. In Euro pean style, you 
write down, to show your knowledge, everyt
hing that you know, 
instead of a simple 
yes or no. And of co urse, that was marked wrong. 
Q: Oh, okay. 

A: But then the word got ou

 made that mistake, the 
second wave knew th at when  
they ask yes or no, you 
don™t do anything but Œ 
Q: Yes or no. 

A: Œ yes or no, true, false. A lot of wo
men worked as maids,
 as whatever they 
could. My father really didn™t want my mo
ther to work because 
he felt it was really 
important that she take care of the children so
 that he could study. He had to review, 
you know, his whole medical 
background, medical tex tbo
oks. So she did a little bit 
work at home, it  was piece 
goods. She got fabrics, and she made li ttle pincushions. 
And I thought they  were very
 cute, and I didn™t realize 
that it was like a horrendous

We took our final ap
artment, you know, 
where we lived fo r a long time, in 
Washin gton Heights
. 
Q: Okay . 
A: Three-sixty 
Wa sworth
(ph) Avenue. And the reason we
 took that apartment is 
they didn™t ask for extra rent, because we si
mply didn™t have it. 
I think we could pay 
for one month, and we had nothing else. An

 him, remember, D r. 
Tamar

New York City
, you know. His mo ther and my mo ther were two years 
apart, but almo st looked like twin
s, they looked so mu ch alike. 
Q: No kidding? 

A: And when he saw my moth
er for the first time, it wa
s very shocking to him, 
because she looked so much like his own mo
ther. He lived with us when  he came, 
and I became very, very close to him, He
 was 17, I was 13. And at that stage, I 
knew more than I maybe should
 have about all details of the Holocaust, because he 
talked very freely to me, and I listened. 
And Œ but befo re I was 13, I knew what was

children had asked, and he wrot

 told me that as he was 
writing, tears were streaming down . 
Q: Sure. 
A: And he™s a sort of a to
ugh guy, you know, 
but he wrote with tears streaming 
down. But he, I think as an
