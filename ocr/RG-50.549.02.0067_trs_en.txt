from a big farm. My father had a big farm in Austria in 
Michaelnbach. And we were four girls a
nd one boy. I had three sisters and one 
brother, so we were raised on a farm 
and I had a very, very happy childhood. 

Q: Frieda, tell us a little bit

to describe your father a

A: Yeah, he was honorable, very honora
ble in the community . He was very well 
known because he was the biggest farmer
 in Michaelnbach. And -- but he was 
very strict, and we were ra
ised very good. We never kn
ow what is worried, or the 
hunger, or the -- we are not loved. And 
we were a -- a happy family. And my 
mo m, she is at -- my  father onl -- my  
mo ther got married, my  mo m was real young 
when  they got married, and she was a ve
ry, very good mom. And my father, I 
loved my  father very mu ch, but he was a 
little bit too strict, you know, but at that 
time we didn't know, we thought that™s the way it have to be. And -- 
Q: So you all had to wo rk
 very hard on the farm? 
A: Oh we -- oh we -- he always said, you 
know, we got to lear
n all the wo rk on a 
farm, no matter what, and so we had to 
do everything, specially near the time 

when  the war broke out, when it -- it got ba
d. We couldn™t get any wo rkers, so we 
had to take over, and every girl had their j
ob, you know, in a -- 
anything in a farm. 
Q: Let™s go back to your siblings 
a little bit, you had three sisters.  
A: Yes. 

Q: Would you give us thei
r names, and whether -- te
ll us whether they were 
younger or older than  you were. 

A: The older one was Margaretta Kran
ika, and the second one was Teresa 
Kranika, and then was me, Frieda. Actua
lly, I was Frederika Kranika. I shortened 

the name my -- my ma -- 
my  n a me  wh en  we came in
 this country. And the

youngest sister was M ariana Kranika. 
And my  brother™s name was Mateus, like 
father and grandfather™s 
name wa s also Mate us. 
Q: What -- what was the relationship? Did you
 feel close, especially  close to either 
one of them? Were you -- were yo
u close, all of you, or -- 
A: Well, yes, we were very close, but my
 oldest si ster w as a very good natured 
p erso n ,  my  -- lik e my  mo m. Yo u  k now, my  
mo m, she was very good natured. And 
the second sister, she was mo re a business 
lady, you know. I al
ways liked her and 
I think she™s my favorite and I think we 
--- we were very much alike. And the 
younger one, she was more strict, spoile
d a little bit and that™s how it is in a 
family. And -- 
Q: Wa-Was your brother, sort of, because he was the only son -- 

A: Mateus, yes. 

Q: -- was he supposed to take 
over the farm at one point? 
A: Oh yes, oh yes, that was the only -- 
the only father™s wish -- was my father™s 
wish that the brother going to take over. And -- 

Q: What -- what -- you w -- you went to 
s -- you helped  on the farm later on, but 
you also went to school. How many -- to 
what kind of school 
did you go and how 
many was -- 

A: Well, we went when -- when  we were 
children, we didn't  help -- we didn™t 
work on the farm til w e -- we -- after we got
 out of school. But we had just a -- the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0067
 
 
 
5
Volk schule, that means the grammar school , and that was no college that time, 
because that were not time. But my father
 was the only one in that wide area what 
he had co llege, because he was only s
on from that f -- you know, from that big 
farm. So he had college, was well educated. 

Q: What -- what kind of -- what kind of lif
e, what kind of dreams for life did you 
have then ? Did you have any 
id eas about what you wanted -- 
A: I was just -- I was just a happy, really
 happy young girl. I loved to sing. I was -- 
I liked to be up on a hill, and was singing
 and yodeling, and I heard my  voice back 
from the forest and I-I -- I was by myself a
nd I just loved that. And I was just a 
happy young kid, that™s all I can say, 
you know? And I learned good in school, I 
was good in school. But later on it -- when 
the -- we got out of school, well we all 
had to work on the farm 
because the father need us. You know, couldn™t get any 
work ers, and was hard. 

Q: But when you got older, did you have 
some idea of what 
you would be later 
on? Did you see some kind 
of -- did you want to have
 a profession to do work , 
maybe, or did you see yourself -- 
A: Mm, not really, we -- we -- that all we
 h -- were teached, you know, to be a 
farmer, that™s all, you know
? Oh  my  God, you know, 
there is some -- some -- 
sometime -- some f -- I re
me mb er  so me frien d s fro m my
 father came over, also 
had big farm, and very well 
off, you know. They were sa
ying, oh, they got a son, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0067
 
 
 
6
you know, I would like to ha
ve one of your daughters 
someday, you know, to -- 
my  son marry your d -- one of your da
ughters, you know? You know, matching -- 
in the old da -- in them olden days they
 were matching up some younger people, 
but didn™t bother me that I didn™t -- that
 it doesn™t -- you know, don™t want to hear 
that. 

Q: Before Julian came on the scene, have 
you been in love a lit tle bit ? Did you 
know somebody -- 

A: No, I -- I know so meone, yeah, and that
 was v -- a ver-ve-very big farm, but I 
di -- I didn™t -- really wasn™t interested, yo
u know. So it was just a little -- may b e a 
little flirting, a little, you know, things, because I don™t know anybody else, but he 

was from a very, very 
good family. And th ey also had -- he had four sisters, and 
they were very similar to us, you know
. But it was nothing, we were wha -- not 
involved. 

Q: Did you have -- did you have
 good friends, good girlfriends? 
A: Oh yes, in school. We™re -- we didn™t 
-- oh, there were girls in our school, on 
our way to school what I still get mail from 
them now, that they were so proud that 
they were with us -- friends 
with us, and that we didn™t hate any -- any -- that we 
are better like them, you know, and don™t ev
en -- not even  cross our mind that we 
are better than others what they ™re fro
m a poor family, you know, we were just 
alike, you know, and we didn't had any 
-- any -- whatever reason to be -- be -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0067
 
 
 
7
think ourselves too much or th -- whatev
er, you know, that we were regular. We 
wanted to be regular girls, yeah, to grow up, yeah. 
Q: But anyway, your family had a large farm
 and your father -- 
there were hunting 
grounds as well [indecipherable] 

A: Oh yes, yes. 

Q: Did you -- wh-what kind of social 
standing did your family have in that 
community, though? Did your father have any kind of positions in the 

community? 

A: Well, he was a -- actually at that tim
e was just a -- a -- there weren™t so many 
positions on a -- in -- on a -- on a -- in them
 days, you know, there was just a -- a 
mayor and a small office over there, a
nd there was not -- but he was very 
respected. When there were m-meeting 
or the something, you know, like the 

farmer™s meeting or the something, he wa
s all -- had to always be there, you know, 
that there -- well, he had that hunting ar
ea, all the whole area 
was -- b elonged to -- 

to my  grandfather, later on to my fathe
r, and it was about hundred years on a -- on 
a -- on that farm. And big rich guys from 
the city, or th -- wh
atever, they came on 
the farm hunting. And that™s why my fath
er was so liked, and so  popular and my 
father was a very edu
cated, smart man, yeah. 
Q: Now, when -- when the National Socialis
ts came to power, di
d your father have 
a party book too? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0067
 
 
 
8
A: Well, he no want to, but
 he had to. That was like 
you have to belong to  the 
party. If not, you™re not going to get any 
machinery, or the -- no workers. So they 
were actually forced to that, you know? 
Bu t later on they had a meeting and that 
was something about I d -- I don™t -- I don™
t know that, you kn
ow, but they -- my  
father didn™t like something what they sa
id, you know, wh at [indecipherable] or 
whatever, and he just throwed that -- whatev
er here -- th is -- that
 he belongs to the 
party. 
Q: T h e memb ersh ip  bo ok ? 

A: Membership book, yeah. He
 just throwed it into it, and he took off and -- and -- 
and he left. He said he never going to be
 back, he don™t want
 to belong to the 
party. So , that ma -- they gave him a re
al hard time, you know. We couldn™t get 
any work ers, and machinery were hard to ge
t. Just when you be
long to the party. 
So there was already a tractor on a way fo
r us, a big tractor, you know, to -- to -- 
that we get on th e farm and that was very
 important. But then [indecipherable] my  
father have the tractor, just
 keep going on, just couple small machineries he got, 
you know, what he really, really needed
, you -- and he really begged for it, you 
know. But th ey gave him a hard time. 

Q: You also said in your videotaped inte
rview that your brother was drafted into 
the army eventually. 
Whe -- when was that
? Do you remember? 
A: Not ex actly d -- that -- that date 
when h -- when  he left, you know, but -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0067
 
 
 
9
Q: But the year? 
A: Yeah, well, he had to go. They always
 were saying if you got one son, you™re 
not [indecipherable] be drafted. And for 
some reason that™s why he throwed that 
membership away. So 
they put my  -- my  brother had to go in  the army . And that 
time he was in France. He came h o me on
ce for -- for furlough and he got married, 
and he had to go -- when he go back, he 
had to go to Ru ssia. He never, never came 
home. 

Q: Was -- was that -- do you remember, was 
that before Julian came to the farm, 
or was that while he was there? D o  you remember? 

A: No, but -- I think Julian was already -- ye
ah, uh-huh, in a -- yeah -- I™m not sure 
the date, you know. 

Q: One -- one more question perhaps, with
 regard to political opinions of your 
parents. This was not the time probably, 
and especially not on 
a farm where talk 
was not that mu ch, I guess you didn™t really 
talk all the time to each  other because 
work  was so much. 

A: No -- yeah. 
Q: But did you ever overhea
r, or did you know outright
 about political opinions of 
your -- of your parents? 
A: It never, ever interested me, neve
r ever, you know? And there were some 

friends came over to my father™s -- to our 
farm. Oh, my father had a extra room, he 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0067
 
 
 
10
was not in -- in a -- in a big [indecipherabl
e] every day, where the people are. Just 
extra room, with a office and -- and hi
s [indecipherable] friends came, you know, 
they talk. When I was a kid, you know, I 
just heard them when they were talking 
[indecipherable] war. I mean, you know, such
 -- so ugly, you kn
ow. But we kids, 
we were -- actually we were never interest
ed and never were to
ld actually what is 
going on.  
Q: Did you -- did you feel so
rt of the op -- before the 
war, and then when the war 
broke out, sort of the -- th
e feel in the village or 
in the commun
ities about the 
situation in -- in Europe or
 about the persecution of -- of people. Did you get to 
hear any of this, did you know how people felt? 
A: Well, a - - everybody felt very bad about that war, why -- why something like 

that happened, see? All of us certain that 
was in September, I think it was, yeah, in 
September when they were 
saying the German marched 
into Poland. And th -- i-it 
is a war, a wa -- how come a war? You 
know, so everybody 
was shook -- shook 
up, you know. Why a war? Wh
y they do th at, you know? So
 that™s all I remember, 
I was a kid, you know, I was really una
ware from -- you know, not interested 
actually, you know, so -- 

Q: And did you -- did you ev
er overhear anything about anti-Jewish, or anti-po -- 

anti-Slavic [indecipherable] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0067
 
 
 
11
A: I heard something when  they were sayi
ng once that they™re
 -- they™re -- they™re 
-- what there was some  Jewish store in Kr
ieskiren where I usually -- we -- we went 
shopping Krieskiren, it™s a 
little bigger city. And there 
was some -- some -- some 
one -- a -- a clothing store, they were sa
ying that he was arrested, fo r what? But 
tha -- we just heard that he was Jewish, 
what that go to do with it? See? And one 
guy I -- I remember he was friend with us
, he always came on the farm. His name 
was Sibel, he used to bring to our house,
 to our farm, that so
ap, know, the smelling 
-- nice smelling soap  and perfumes and things
. He had a -- a store like that, but he 
always asked Mom to give him enough 
butter that he have enough butter and 
enough -- enough whatever he
 need s at home, and my  mo m always give it to him, 
you know. And he brought us 
special [indecipherable] girl, oh yes, we got a nice s-
soap and a little bit of perfume for your gi
rls, you know, and we
 were happy about 
that and we liked him a lot, you know.  
Q: And then  -- and then  Julian came one da
y. Your father had applied for workers 
because he lacked workers -- 

A: Right. 
Q: -- and he got -- you got two Polish wo
rk ers who were work ing -- supposed to  
work on your farm. Did -- you -- you don™
t -- do you know how it came that those 
two were chosen , by any ch ance? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0067
 
 
 
12
A: Well, that -- the commun
ity, they were -- they were
 saying my -- my -- my -- 
my father had to put applications in to ne
ed  some work ers, and he did. He wanted 
mo re, but they decide to give him one. Th
en later on they said
 two because they 
really saw we needed -- we 
re -- really need workers be
cause they all -- they all 
wants to go -- you couldn™t get Austrian wo
rkers because they™re all going to  war, 
you know? And my  brother 
also. And so they said not -- December eight, that 
there going to be -- got to be -- two Po lis
h workers got to be picked  up. So my  
father went and want to pick up the Po
lish workers. At the time they were saying 
from -- from Poland, to  Au stria, to Vienna, a -- such a snowstorm came, you 
know, so the train got stuck somewhere, 
they couldn™t get to Austria, you know. 

So my father was waiting, the -- all the fa
rmers were there, they were waiting in -- 
in -- in [indecipherable] on a -- on a -- on a -- on a -- you know, on a ha -- s -- 

what the -- get the workers who -- they™re su
pposed to come in the office, and they 
had to go home because they
 didn™t came. W ell, my father do -- was about fo ur or 
five kilometer, almost five 
kilometer to walk home in th
at snowstorm, so he got 
real sick. He was -- had a bad co ld. The next
 day he had said he -- he just can™t go, 
you know. And we need them 
workers, what we going to do? So he said Frieda, 
you want to go? I said, yeah, I go. We c
ouldn't go with  any -- any -- any horses or 
the -- or the wagon or the -- anything like th
at, so I had to walk and walk in that 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0067
 
 
 
13
snow and there was no snowplowed or a
nything. And I walked for kilometers to 
get to this -- for the wor -- ge
t the worker, ye
ah, workers.  
Q: And then they started to
 work for you, and -- and yo
u got to like Julian slowly. 
Did you like him right away, or was it a 
slow proce -- what did you like about 
him? 
A: Well, actually, when -- 
when -- when th-the man in
 the unem -- unemployment 
off -- when the unemp loyment office said, 
you know, you get this wo rker and this 
work er. Doesn™t mean anything to me, 
you know, so okay, let™s go home. It got 
dark already, was almost 4:30, something 
like that. And that ma
n from the -- from 
the unemp loyment office, he -- he know 
my father very well. I -- I n -- even 

thought about that he didn™t
 trust them two guys, you know, with  a young girl to 
walk home for four kilomete
r in the dark. Never even 
came -- came to my mind, 
you know? He said, listen, I called  taxi fo
r you, you going to go home in a taxi 
with them two guys. So they
 all -- we almo st got home with the taxi, but up on a 
hill there was so much snow 
that we have to walk, you 
know, we had to walk to 
the farm. And we did. And we came home 
to the farm, they all was waiting for -- 
for us. My mo m had a big supper ready. My
 sister s were  there,
 even my grandpa 
was there and my  father. And we walked in
, here they are, youknow, so okay. My 
father, he knows a few words in Polish, 
right, because he was in the first World 
War, he was in Poland. And little by little
, you know, they got -- you know, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0067
 
 
 
14
friendly, yeah, and -- but didn™t came into my  mind that I had a -- you know, I 
really -- I just liked, you kn
ow, that we got work ers, and got help on th e farm, you 
know? And -- 

Q: So how did that change, though? 

A: Well, he was very, very helpful, ve
ry f-friendly, Julian,
 you know? And we 
liked that, we girls, we really liked that
, that he was friendly, and very pleasant 
and we got along good and things. Bu
t still, you know, gee, I would never, 
because you could never, ever -- they were
 saying, you know, don™t you ever get 
involved with someone -- th
ey said, you sh ouldn™t eat ev
en on the same -- by the 
same tab l e.  Bu t my  mo m said  n o , n o t  su ch
 a thing, she said, you know, you all -- 
we™re -- we -- we girls had to eat by th
e same table what the workers was wer -- 
eating. But Mom and Dad, they
 eat in the other room, y
ou know, but you girls, we 
always -- and we did. We™re at th e sa
me table, eating at the same table. 

Q: What did you like -- what did you lik
e about Julian, th ough [indecipherable] 

A: I don™t know, he was friendly and happy 
and th is and that, a
nd I think we girls, 
we needed  someone to, you know, to be 
nice, and bring some -- I don™t know, it™s 
just little by little, very little by little, and he
 was nice and -- and once we -- he 
helped me to carry something in the barn
, you know, and he just -- just lean over 
and -- and -- and kissed me. I said, oh, don
™t you dare, you know? He stole a kiss 

from me, you know. And gee, 
I got all shook up th at he 
did that, I didn™t expect 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0067
 
 
 
15
that, you know? And I didn't look at him fo
r three days, I didn™t even look at him. 
I got so -- so scared. And then little by 
little, you know, he wa
s nice, you know, 
really very, very gentle and little by little, 
we got -- yeah, like -- 
liked each other a 
little bit, you know. But, oh my gosh, this can™t happen, this is 
out of question, you 
know, this just -- 
Q: You were very much awar e of how dangerous this is? 
A: Yes, oh yes, oh yes,
 oh yes. First of all, for myse
lf and for him too, you know, 
because if they find out if
 I just mentioned somethi
ng that he is friendly or 
something, you know, they would put hi
m away and he woul
d be gone fo rever, 
you know, so -- they were so
 strict that time, you know,
 so -- and I wouldn™t do 
that.  
Q: Then , at one day, you allowed him to lis
ten secretly to the radio. Now that was 
also dangerous. 

A: It was also dangerous, yes, yeah, 
because it was just a -- from the big room 
would a -- where we usually eat, you know, 
was a door to the smaller room where 
my  father had the radio, you know, that
 was very -- was just one radio in the 
house. And he wanted to listen to that, 
you know, and [indecipherab le] I just keep 
the door unlocked and he we
nt in and listened to that
 radio, you know. Nobody 
knew that, you know, so -- he didn™t do 
anything wrong, nor any harm, you know, 

but I -- I did let him do that, you know? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0067
 
 
 
16
Q: What wou -- I always have to ask wh
y, but you know, so you were a young 
person, an d -- but it was -- it was dange
rous. Why did you -- I mean, it almost 
seems as if you we
re courting danger. 
A: Yeah, yeah. 
Q: Why would you do that -- what --  

A: I don™t know myself. I don™t know myse
lf, you know. Little by little we fell in 
love, I think, you know, and th at™s how 
it happened, you know. My  father noticed 
that, m-my father -- and so
mebody else must  too, you
 know, must -- somebody -- 
somebody else mu st have saw something. A
nd my  father said no, that can™t go on 
like that, and -- and once he did slap me
, you know, and I was so hurt because it 
was my father what I loved so dearly
 and he loved me, too. And th at -- 
Q: Did somebody see you -- did somebody -- 

A: Probably . 

Q: -- see him while he was listening and [indecipherable] 

A: I don™t know. So mebody mu st have se
e us, you know, what -- we were friendly 
to each other, or whatever. Yeah, and -- 
Q: And then eventually yourfather called both of you -- 
first separately and then 
both -- 
A: Mm-hm. 

Q: -- of you into a room and gave yo
u an ultimatum basically because -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0067
 
 
 
17
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- it was too dangerous -- 

A: Right, right. 

Q: -- one of you had to leave,
 so you decided to -- to go -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- and s-say that -- 
A: It was a big step for me, that w as -- I 
knew if I don™t go that he is in danger. 
Q: Julian? 
A: Julian is in danger, yes. And I couldn™
t let that happen, I just couldn™t, you 
know? It™s something -- something tells 
you th at, you know, it -- you -- you can™t 
do th at, something -- something going to  
happen to him and he would be gone 
forever, you know? And so  I said, I go. That
 was terrible, you know, it was a big st 
-- big step for me. And my father was stub
born too, you know, he
 said well, if you 
like that, you know, so -- 

Q: Did anybody in the fami
ly try to hold you back 
or to change your mind? 
A: No, my  mo m tried, you kn
ow, but some sisters even said, n -- n -- later on they 
were saying when -- if the -- if th -- I ca
me home, they were saying, why don™t we 
stick together, why didn™t -- we were there 
for you? So they just let me go, just 

like that, you know, and I ha
d no one to tu rn to. 
Q: So Ju lian stayed on the farm -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0067
 
 
 
18
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- and you went to anothe
r small farm, but you -- you -- 
A: No, actually, that was a big farm. It 
was a big farm, that first one. Was a big 
farm, yeah. And I was there, working there 
and somebody mu st have see us, or the 
-- something, I don™t know. 

Q: So you cont -- you 
continued to see each other [indecipherable] 
A: Yes, oh he came immediately, every Su
nday, you know, yes. Like we said, you 
know, at that time, you know, when I left, 
we were saying th at I know th at that -- 
that gonna be far away, so far away it™s not
 in our area over here that they put me 
to work because you have
 not a choice what a -- the u -- employment office puts 

you, you have to go, you 
know, so there was no other choice. So I know th at™s 
going to  be in Eferding. And I sen -- I said, in Eferding going to  be a church, I 

know that. And near the church over th
ere we™re going to meet -- you™re going to 
be here at one o™clock, we going to see each other Sunday, th
at following Sunday. 
And that™s what had happened, a way -- we
 saw each other. He came, and we were 
very happy to saw each 
other, and that™s -- 
Q: But then eventually yo
u got denounced an d you were
 arrested and you were 
interrogated by the Gestapo in -- in Linz? 

A: Right. 

Q: And you took the -- basically 
you to ok the blame on you th at -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0067
 
 
 
19
A: Oh yes, oh yes, I took it -- 
Q: Say something a little more about that. 

A: Well, I take the blame on me, I -- I sa
id, you know, well, was nothing actually -

- it was nothing wrong, you know, he just
 came as a friendl
y, you know, friend 
and told  me what™s going on at home beca
use I wanted to know 
what™s going on at 
home. And there™s -- th ey said then later on 
-- I said that was not his fault, and we 
didn™t do anything wrong, so that™s how 
that time they couldn™
t prove it, and then 
they said I -- I -- I was there I think 11 da
ys, something like that, and they lef -- let 
him go Friday and th ey kept me over the 
weekend that we don™t meet because they 
gave him a -- a-a -- a job far away, that wa
 -- in completely different direction, and 
me too, you know, so I already had that
 place that was on a small farm way up on 
a hill by the woods, but you k
now, you couldn™t -- it™s just 
a -- a -- a -- a lost town, 
you know, really. They put me
 there what nobody would find me over there, into a 

farm, you know. And -- 

Q: So you had to sign papers
 though, both of you, that -- 
A: Oh yes, we had to -- 
Q: -- you would never 
see each other again. 
A: -- right, we™d never see each other ag
ain. And I signed th
e paper, you know, I 
hadn™t a lot of choice. And I thought, my
 gosh , you know, I not going to fi -- we 
find -- no find each other anyway again, you 
know, that™s all. I felt like I was lo-

20
lost, you know, so I -- they let me out 
Monday mo rning about 9:30, something like 
that, and I walked around on a train station,
 there were a lot of people there, and 
all kind of people, was a big train station 
in Linz. And I thought, my gosh, where I 
am going now, so -- wh at going to happe
n to me now? And then  I looked up, oh 
my  gosh, it was like a miracle, you know? Ju
lian walked in from another train that 

came out, you know, came on for -- for another station. I couldn™t believe it, you 
know, that was like God dropped him dow
n from the heaven, you
 know, and that 
at least I™m not alone.  
Q: And then you decided to see each other again after all? 

A: Yes, immediately. He had my  addre
ss where I go, and I ha
d his, you know? I 
said, where we going to be, no matter wh
at, you know, this next Sunday, with the 
bi -- our bicycles, we
 had our bicycles, we going to
 be by -- by Lanstrasser. From 
Linz to Wells, up, you know, that™s -- th
at™s L anstrasser, that™s a beautiful -- 
Q: It™s a co unt -- count -- it™s 
a country  road kind of -- 

A: It™s from the country, it™s from Gunskirc
hen, goes to Wells, and it™s a big, big 

road to Linz, that™s a -- a very popular
 street. And that™s where we found each 
other then , you know, yeah. 

Q: But eventually 
you were denounced  again. The farmer where you wo rked  
found out earlier, but he decided not to say 
anything, but when  you
 decided to give 
up work on the farm -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0067
 
 
 
21
A: Right. 
Q: -- he denounced you and you were in
terrog -- you were brought again to the 
Gestapo and you were interrogated, and th
is time I think you ha
d to stay a little 
longer, but I need to change cassette, and -- 

A: Mm-hm, okay. 

Q: -- we™ll talk about that. 
This is the end of tape one, side A, interview with 
Frieda Noga. 
End of Tape One, Side A 
Beginning Tape On e, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of a United
 States Holocaust Memorial Museum 
interview with Frieda Noga. 
This is tape number one, side
 B. So you were back in 
Linz at the Gestapo headquarters and th
is time the situation was more serious 
because you had already signed papers 
that you would never see him again, and 
the interrogation was -- was much more ha
rsh. And what -- what happened then? 
A: Right. Well, one, the Gestapo took 
me, and interviewed me. They -- they 
showed me -- they told me 
that I was already here, that I mu st -- you know, second 
time here and that was more serio u s. 
And how come, what happened? And you 
sees -- sees -- see still th
at Pole, you know, they were
 sa ying, you know, to make 
him -- you know, make me -- humiliate
 me, you know? And I said, well, you 

know, once in awhile, you kn
ow, we are friends, and thi
ngs. Then -- then later on 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0067
 
 
 
22
they were saying what -- you know, to -- 
to force it out on me, you know, that you 
had something to do with him, you know. 
It was no other way, you know, th at just 
force it out of me there™s some poss -- well,
 yes, I had something to do with him, 
we had something to do each other. Okay, that
™s about it. But, I said, it™s my fault. 
I took it on me, blame on me, and I -- I thoug
ht that going to be better for Julian, 

you know, because if it™s the opposite th
en -- then to take it out on him, and 
they™re going to -- I know they™re going to 
-- not going to kill me. I know that, I 
was sure, you know. Bu t I took it -- everything
 on me, on -- that is everything my  
fault, you know, that we got together a
nd had something to  do with each other. 
And -- okay, so they -- they were sayi
ng, you know what™s -- what™s going to 
happen to  you, you™re going to  be black an
d blue, and you™re going to be sent to 
concentration camp. Well, I had nothing to
 say, you know, so wh at I could say? 

And I got back to the prison cell again, on
ly in two days, I remember, my father 

came to the Gestapo. And he talked with 
them. He had a lot of friends over -- you 
know, some people told  him, you know, to go there and do so mething about it. 

And my father came, h e wanted to see me
, so they called me out from the cell, and 
a special -- there were a speci
al room where you visit us and my  father was there, I 
was scared to death, you kno
w. And then -- he was very gentle to me. He said, 
what happened? He said, please tell me  th
e truth, he said, you got to tell me the 
truth. If you tell -- you -- nothing happened
 between you two, you know, and I do 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0067
 
 
 
23
anything to get you out of here, you 
know, get you home. Did you -- what you 
say? I said, yes, we ha -- da -- we had 
something to do with
 each other. Then he 
was just shook up. He said
 -- he hugged me and hold me for awhile. He said, I 
can™t help you now, he said. And 
he was very sad about it. And -- 
Q: But that you took the blame on your
self, that you were the one who initiated 
the relationship -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- that actually really saved Julius, because otherwise -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- if he had -- if -- if -- if they thou
ght that he was th -- had started the whole 
thing -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- they would have killed him? 

A: Oh yeah, definitely, de
finitely, yeah. Because they killed many out -- and in 
[indecipherable] they were sa
ying they were -- they were
 saying that some of them 
were hanged out in the woods, and some Po
lish people have to come and see it, 
how they  were hanged in the wo ods, you kn
ow, because he had so mething to  do 
with German girl, and on -- once they were 
saying that was a -- a German girl in 
some town far away 
from us. A German girl that sh
e had something 
to do with a 
Polish young man, and then th ere were a 
nasty mayor over there in that town. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0067
 
 
 
24
They  shaved  her head , put her on a wagon, 
and with -- on a h -- on the horse, and 
drove her around in town. And that 
there was a sign up there, I had sexual 
something to do with a 
Polish Auslander [indeciphera
ble] yeah, foreigner, you 
know? And that was te rrible, 
that was just ugly, you know
, it was -- and that was -
- you know, heartbreaking. 
Q: But -- 
A: But at least it didn™t happen to me like 
that, you know, so I was glad that they 
didn™t put me out in the open
 like that. So they were sayi
ng that I got to go to the 
concentration camp, and th ey were -- we 
were about seven or the -- eight girls 
there, all th e same problem, all -- all the sa
me thing they had in a cell, all the same 
thing, you know? And they sa
id, well that™s all it is, you
 know. If we survive, we 
survive, if not, you know, then  that™s
 it, you know? And th
en I was there til 
Novemb er, in the Gestapo, lock ed up. And 
then they came, I had to signed a pink 
slip -- a pink paper, sign my  name. And that
 was -- dos -- th-that slip was for the 

concentration camp, that I got a -- they se
nt me to concen -- yeah, I will know it, 

you know, if they come with
 the pink slip, they know th
at™s a concentration camp, 
and I was one of them, you know. So -- 

Q: Did -- did you -- have you heard -- wh
at did you know about concentration 
camps at that point? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0067
 
 
 
25
A: Noth ing. Nothing. Ju st supposed  to be 
bad there, that™s all. I didn™t know wh ere 
it is, I never know where is
 Ravensbrück, th ey were 
saying to  Ravensbrück. I 
never know where is Ravensbrück, and I di
dn't know what is there, what™s going 
on over there on -- we™ll see, you know, so
 I -- I went along the way there, the 
[indecipherable] pushed me along, that™s all. 
Q: Ha-Had you heard about wh at kind 
of people were supposed  to be in 
concentration camps? 

A: Well, at -- what happened
 when they took us there, 
the -- on a train to Salzburg, 
and when  we went thro ugh the station, th
rough th e train station, the police, you 
know, we were all transport by police to
 -- one were in front, on the side, on -- 
they had the -- the -- the -- the army guns 
[indecipherable] we were heavy, were -- 
I don™t know, murderers or th -- someth

some people were 
there in the train station, older people an

happened , what kind of people are this
, you know? And, well 
they go to the 
concentration camp, the police were sayi
ng, you know. Oh , they don™t want to 
work? Oh. And they start spitting on us, 
you know, and -- some of them, you 
know, some of them. An
d then they took us, we were 
-- stayed there in Salzburg in 
a cell for a day. The next day we went on 
to Munich, and in Munich we stayed two 
days, or or the -- three days, something 
like that. And Dresden we stayed a couple 
of days over there because other trains 
what were coming together, you know, it 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0067
 
 
 
26
was a -- a big, big th ing, you know, big tran
sport. And then we went into Leipzig. 
Leipzig, you know, in Leipzi
g I was very, very -- no, i-in Dresden, I think, in 
Dresden I was very, very sick. I had a co
ld, you know, because it w as the winter. 
Was raining and snowing and 
blowing and everything and -- and in a cattle train, 
you know, was no heat in th
ere, nothing, you know. And 
then in a cell I was -- I 
just thought, you know, hi -- 
I was shaking, I was very
 cold, I had the chills, you 
know. And they brought th
e f -- some food in here, some soup, whatev -- 
whatever. I couldn™t even look at it, 
you know, I couldn™t eat
 nothing, you know? 
Then they saw that I was r
eally sick, I mean, you know, 
that lady what took care 
of the cell, she was saying something, 
you know, she™s sick, you know? So sh e 
brought me two pills. I don™t know what
 was -- what the two pills. And I took 
them two pills and in about two hours I 
got up and I was fee
ling good, and by day 
-- the next day we went on the transport 
and went to the concentration camp. They 
must be two aspirin, or something, or th
e -- whatever, two -- two pills to get me up 
on my feet, you know? So -- 
Q: So what -- when 
did you arrive in ravens -- Ravensbrück? 
A: In Ravensbrück we arrived Novemb er 18. 

Q: What year? 

A: ™41, I thin -- I™m not sure. I got mixe
d -- get mixed up in them years already. 
And they  took us from the train station, 
on open trucks, and th ey took us and it 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0067
 
 
 
27
was cold, and windy and sn ow
y, and we had to march, 
it was dark already, a 
concentration camp, oh my
 gosh, they™re going thro
ugh the -- through the -- 
through the whole thing, you know, we we
nt in there, was all kind of barracks 
here, and hardly could see 
anything because it was almo st
 dark already. And then 
they took us somewhere downstairs, some
where in a -- in a tu
nnel. And when we 
walked downstairs I got scared, it was th
e most scary things. They were like on a -
- on a -- on a -- when you walk down it, a
lls you could see was caskets. What the 
caskets are doing here, why? 
We were so unexperienced,
 you know, so we didn't 
know what™s going on here. All caskets ther
e, and then we were -- we went down 
even lower and there were cells, th ere were
 concrete floor, was cold down there. 
There were cells there to pu
t us in there, and we hear
d so me screaming, hollering, 

a girl was please help, please help. And th
e dogs were barking and screaming, we -
- we thought, what happened, what happened,
 what is this, with -- you know if -- if 

you -- if you -- you don™t know what™s goi
ng on here. But then 
in a little while she 
-- little by little she stopped screaming. Th
e -- the [indecipherable] master killed 
her or something, you know, that™s wh
at we thought, but it sound like it, you 
know. The next day they brought us up an
d we were -- I had to go in a -- go for a 

shower and get the clothing over there,
 and the concentration camp clothing. And 
they said we going to go 
on a block 16, that was the [indecipherable], the -- th e 
newcomer block. And we were -- all we
nt there, the -- the block 16 and from 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0067
 
 
 
28
block 16 later on, they took
 whatever they got room fo
r, for the prisoner what they 
coming, the new ones. And from block 16, 
when they called us, they called me 
and other girls, they called us. You be -- 
you gotta come up to  the [indecipherab le] 
you know, we gotta come up there, you 
know. So they shav
ed us, because we 
were the Polish -- you know, the -- we ha
d something to do with Po lish young 
men, so they put us to shame, you know, 
th ey shaved our hair up. And th at was the 
biggest shock to me in my life. 

Q: So, when this -- when th
e people s-s-spit on you on 
your way to the camp, it 
seemed that people thought that -- 

A: We were good fo r nothing girls, just 
nothing, we™re just a -- bad gir -- bad pe -- 
people that don™t want to wo rk. 

Q: Oh, they thought that la
zy people went to camps -- 
A: Yes, right. 

Q: -- and -- and criminals, probably -- 

A: Right, right. 

Q: -- so when you were there 
you found out that was different. 
A: Yes, right, right. 

Q: What -- what kind of people did you meet there? 

A: Well, usually there were a lot of -- th
ere were on -- one block Jewish, and two -
- I think two blocks Gypsies. They  had 
their -- all their ow

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0067
 
 
 
29
certain numb ers. And there were a couple 
blocks about the -- the Jehovah Witness. 
Jehovah Witnesses. And criminals and 
what the people what had the -- the 
[indecipherable] their times a
nd then they them out. They
 -- they have to -- they 
put them in the concentration camps, 
you know, certain people wh at they had 
problem with the -- the law, yeah. And -- 
Q: Well, i-in -- in the videotaped  intervie
w you talked  in some detail about your 
experience in Ravensbrück. So  first you 
had to  wo rk outside and it was really, 
really difficult and cold. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Then they were looking for seamstre
sses, and you passed yo
urself off as one. 
A: Yes, yes.  

Q: And it was -- it was a little easier. 

A: Right. 

Q: How long -- how lo
ng did you stay actual
ly, in Ravensbrück? 
A: I stay in Ravensbrück f -- til ab out in
 August, en -- end of August, I think it 
was, or the September, something like that
. I forgot. I really forgot the date 
already.

30
Q: And then you were -- 
A: 11 months. 

Q: -- then you were let go. Wa
s that unu -- that was unusual? 

A: Very un -- no, it was very unusual. 
All of a sudden -- we went to work  and 
some SS lady came with the dog, and -- on
 my  -- on th e job where I was work ing 
she called out my  numb er [indecipherable] 
that means 8446, th
at was my number, 
there was no -- no name called, just the num
ber. Yeah, it was me, w h at -- this what 
happened. So that lady wa
 -- she was in the -- our ch
ief, you know, at work, our 
boss lady. She was saying, is it you? Wh at
 happened to you? 
Wh at did you do? I 
said, I don™t know. And so I had to go with
 her, because nobody 
expect that I go 
free, you know, so [indecipherable] was so
mething unusual. Oh, she said, we™re 
going to  go in a [indecipherable] to -- to 
the SS chief, and I -- 
w -- I thought, you 
know, my God, you know, to 
-- to execute me or some thing [indecipherable] or to 
put me someplace else, what did I do? An
d then he told  me, you know, you™re 
lucky. You dumb lu cky girl, she said 
-- he said, you know. You know what? 
You™re going home, you go free. To me 
it was like a -- a -- you know, something 
from heaven. But th
ey said, you™re going to  go home
 to your parents. I thought, oh 
my God, I -- I™m homesick al
ready, you know, but what 
I gonna have to face over 
there, though? So -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0067
 
 
 
31
Q: Did -- did you find out what happened?
 Ho w it -- how it came  that you got to 
be free? 
A: No, no. Well, when I got home, I reme
mb er they put me on a train and th ey 
took me on a train and she mu st have bo
ught the ticket or th -- something, the -- 
they had to sit there in a tr
ain, to go to Au stria. And that was about oh, about a six 

hour ride, something like that, far, far 
away, you know? So , I th
ought what happen 
now, I -- I just, please God, do with me 
what you think is right, you know, so I 
went to Austria, to Wells, it was still a 
little bit -- it was light out, it was still about 
four o™clock in the afternoon, something lik

to Krieskiren because the tr -- you gotta 
take another train from there. And to  
Krieskiren, the train gonna be there prob

 oh my , okay, I went home, scared like 
anything. And then I went -- Krieskiren I got out and I -- immediately I -- I didn™t 
go in side of the train because I was -- 
you know, somebody might see me. I went 
right on the side down in a f -- in a -- in
 the bushes, so I™m hiding away, and we™re 
going to  a road what goes, you know, just 
the forest over there, and I was hiding 

out there, you know. And I was waiting til it™

father came to me. Sa

Q: Did you -- did you find out later how
 it was possible for you to  get out?

Q: In -- in your videotaped interview, you al

some real effect on your family?  
A: Oh yes. 

Q: Were there repercussions? 

A: Oh yes, oh yes. 

Q: Talk about that [indecipherable] 

A: Oh yeah. Well, first of all my sister
s, when they went 
someplace or th -- 
something, you know, that 
my father, oh Frieda is in
 a concen tration camp , you 
know, this and that, she had something to
 do with a Pole, you know? And that 
time it was embarrassing,humilia
ting, and -- to them, not on -- to my parents also, 
you know? And wh en sometimes some -- 
my siste rs, the y  g -- they went 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0067
 
 
 
35
someplace, somewhere [indecipherable
] doing, so the -- there was some 
[indecipherable] you know. On e time some pe
ople were asking, you know, is that 
true that Frieda came h o me from the c
oncen tration camp ? They say yeah. Well, 
you shouldn™t be embarrassed about, that™s 
her side, you know, sh -- that™s not you 
fault. That they were saying
 to the girl -- to my sister
s, you know? And I was like, 
you know, when -- first time I don™t want to
 even go to  church , nothing. I went on 
a Sunday sometime in the afternoon far away 
to a chapel and -- instead of going to 
church to [indecipherable] in -- in  
Michaelnbach. And then later on when 
somebody saw me they were
 saying, did you -- did y
ou see her? She came back, 
did you saw her? I felt like a -- a terrible 
criminal, you know? I felt terrible. And -- 
but little by little, then later on, my hair 
were growing back and my mom said, no 
go down in that village, you know, wh
o -- everybody knows you and knows us. 
Go -- it was hard for -- for someone to 
take you ah ead -- you know hairdresser, 
you know, what they  fix the hair? Said, go
 to Wells, that™s far away. Drive over 
there, I give you some butter, give you 
some meat, you know. If they™re not take 
you -- they -- they gonna take
 you if you give them that 
butter, because meat that -
- money that time wasn™t important, just
 like meat and all that, you know, butter, 
you know, people in a city, 
they look forward to get so
mething. So they took me 
and I went inside at this hairdresser a
nd she looked at me, you know, he looked  -- 

I look kind of funny, you kn
ow, see what happen. And th en I give her -- I didn't 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0067
 
 
 
36
say anything, I didn™t have to answer her. 
And then she did my  hair, she gave me a 
permanent, and I came home and little by little
 I looked better every day. And then 
I start going even -- some friends saw me 
also, you know, go -- but I always feel 
so guilty, I was the guilty black sheep, yo
u know, I was just bad girl or the -- 
something, I don™t know, you know. Bu
t I wonder wh at happened to Julian. 
Q: Well, and then wh at™s -- I wanted to 
ask you -- so not all 
of your friends from -- 
from the earlier days left you alone, they 
also were still friends to you, some of 
them at least? 

A: Well, certain distance. Certain dist
ance, you know? Yeah. Bu t that was some 
dark clouds over, I noticed that, I see that, 
you know, so it wasn
™t the same like it 
was, no, no, no. Because that time th
ey didn't understood,
 you know? Now it™s 
entirely different, you know, now they ar
e writing to me, the school friends and 
everybody, you know, they™re
 so happy for us and everything. Bu t them days, you 
know, they were different times.  

Q: But then one day you did hear actu
ally from somebody who had a card from 
Julius, right? 
A: Well, a -- the -- a Polish guy that 
-- Polish guy still work ing on our farm, you 
know? The Polish guy what they  had -- 
what -- what Julian came, you know, he 
was still w o rking on that farm, y ou know
? I remember once he was saying, you 
know, wh-when the war is 
over, when I going to go 
home, what I gonna told 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0067
 
 
 
37
Julian™s mo ther how Julian died, you know
? And wh at I gonna tell him? I had no 
answer for that, you know, I was hurting. And he received a card from Julian, you 

know, and th at just happened
 that the mailman came, a
nd well, he received some 
mail also from Poland
, that Polish guy [indecipherable] a -- a card from Julian, and 
he said to me, look I got a -- a -- a -- a card from Julian. I said oh my  God, wh ere 

is he? And that said, concen tra -- concen
tration camp  Flossenbürg. Oh my  God, 
you know. What we gonna do, how we 
gonna -- we gotta do something about, 
how we gonna help him, you 
know. So I wrote a card, and ev erything in  secret, 
nobody knows, you 
know? And I told him to mail
 it out. I was saying I™m okay, 
I™m all -- I™m doing fine, and I™m healt
hy, and how ab out you? And please be 
strong [indecipherable] keep your head 
high, you know? And I put down , Un cle 

Franz, un -- Uncle Franz. And that way 
he recognized my s 
-- my -- my writing, 
Julian. We sent it to -- to that was the a
ddress, that -- that time I know he™s alive, 
you know. And then  I though
t oh my God, and th -- 
I thought to send him a 
package, you know, th
 -- something. And I -- I did -- I™m in a secret -- secretly I 
had a big box, you know, ever
ything in hiding, in se -- that my  sisters couldn™t see 
it, you know? And we all had our closet in 
a -- and all -- all our girls had our own 
closet, you know, and I had ever
ything hiding in my  closet in a big box. My  sisters 
were going someplace and I was all by myself
 and that was in the fall. There was 
some pears [indecipherable] 
you know, they  were really hard wh en  you pick them, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0067
 
 
 
38
and in about three, four weeks they g
onna get soft, you know? And some apples, 
you know, that were picked, it was in -- 
in s -- in October, something like that. 
And I put -- I rolled everything in a [indeci
pherable] to -- in 
a big box, and th en I 
found still was some holes missing, I put 
some onions in there, I know that the 
onions are, you know, healt
hy for you. And I found a littl
e bit of tobacco from my 
father, you know, put it on the side, you kn
ow, put mi -- mi 
-- a -- fill up the 
package. And packed 
that and put the address on and 
-- and I said to Franz, you 
gonna take this on the post office. He 
said, how I gonna -- how I gonna do th at? 
You know? I said, I gonna give you a little 
bit schnapps -- because he used to like 
to drink -- give you a little bit of schnapps 
in a little bottle, and y
ou gonna take this 
to -- but not here in our area, you have 
to go far away with 
this -- with this 
package, that they don™t know, hey, 
concen tration camp does something, you 
know, who is this, you know? 
But over there in the post
 office, they don™t pay 
attention, it™s far away, it™s a big city, yo
u know. And he did. 
And later on I found 
out that Julian received this pack
age. Made me very happy. And -- 
Q: But you -- but you never knew. 
A: I never know, no. And -- 
Q: Well, maybe this is a good time -- oops -- 
this is a good time to say that this is 
the end of tape one, side B, 
interview with Frieda Noga. 
End of Tape One, Side B 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0067
 
 
 
39
 
Beginning Tape Two, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of a United
 States Holocaust Memorial Museum 
interview with Frieda Noga. Th
is is tape number two, side A. So  you didn™t hear -- 
after the package -- after you sent the p
ackage, you didn't really hear anything 
from Julian, right? 
A: No, I didn™t. Didn™t hear anything, just
 I keep praying the he gonna make it, 
that he gonna come back.  
Q: And then  one day the war was over -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- and he actually did come back, and 
sh owed up at your do
or. Tell a little bit 
about that. 

A: Yeah, that was in May, 18, I rememb
er. A nd it was -- the -- the war -- when -- 
is -- was over in March 23, and I thought, I 
wonder if he come -- come here, or the 
-- it -- if he survived, a
nd th ings, you know, and I ke
ep thinking about it, you 
know, if he made it, you know, over there in concentration camp . And th en it was 
already March, April, May. No, no, he no
t gonna come, that™s too long already, he 
would be here by now, you kno
w. So, that was one day in
 a -- I think it was Friday 
or the Saturday evening, Sa
turd ay evening it was, May 18, and -- 1945, and I was -
- it was a b eautiful evening, the birds were 
singing in  the -- in the -- in the big yard 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0067
 
 
 
40
-- in the -- in the hofe out there, you kn
ow. And a -- I was sitting out there on a big 
bench, it was about seven -- seven during th
e evening. And my  sisters were in the 
house, and I was sitting out there in a bi
g bench, I was thinking, you know, what -- 
what my  life gonna be. And isn™t mu ch 
wo rth it, you know, so how my  life gonna 
be, and th ings, and then  I was thinking, 
my  God, Julian not go
nna -- he not -- he 
didn™t survived, he 
didn't make it, but how I can 
get in touch with his mother, 
because I know his mother loved him so 
much, and he was very close with his 
mother, that I™d want to let her know that
 he was not a criminal, that he was a good 
man, and that he lost his life becau se he loved me. And to let her know that. If he 

didn™t -- maybe he came back to Poland
, you know, so I wasn™t sure, maybe he 
went straight to Poland from the concen
tration camp if he is alive. And I was 
thinking like that, and -- and the doorbell™s 
ringing. My sister we
nt out -- out to the 
-- answer the door, the big door, and then 
she said, Julius, and when I heard that 
word, there™s just one Julius, you k
now, what I know. My God, this is 
unbelievable, that mu st be him, you know.
 And I came running up to the door, and 
that was him with another friend, both of
 them on a bicycle, you know. I said, oh 
my God, you™re here, and then he -- we hu
gged, and my  sister stood there, and she 

went -- she went in the house, and we ta
lked for awhile and 
then we said well, 
tomorrow we gonna meet so
me where, and that™s how I was so very happy. 
Q: Did you feel that y ou still had to m
eet secretly, or did you [indecipherable] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0067
 
 
 
41
A: Well, it was -- i-it wasn™t against the 
law any mo re, I know 
th at, you know, but 
I don™t think my  father would be very, 
very happy, but, you know, maybe, you 
know, it isn™t that bad like it was before
, you know, we™ll see, you know, wh at 
gonna happen, you know? And we didn™t 
give up with each other, you know. He 
came and he say he love me, and I say that
 I love you, and, yo
u know, you be the 
love of my  life and he said the same thi
ng and -- and that™s a
bout it, you know, we 
gonna get -- I want to marry you, he said, you know. 
Q: But he didn™t stay at your father™s
 -- at your parents™s farm, he stayed 
somewhere else, right? 

A: Oh, he -- he was -- he was someplace 
else, on another farm, on his friends, and 
the people were very good
 to him, they let him st
ay there. But I was on my 
father™s farm, on our farm at home, yeah
. And then we came
, meet each other 
almo st every day, you know

r. And that™s how they  did it, you know, 

so once he was th -- brought along, he 
came, and Julian came, you know, so they 
approached my  father, you kn

A: Well, actually, I wouldn™t mind to stay

I mean, you know, to -- to have a f -- to ha

 he said, you know, 
he got in contact with some friends and so me society that is a possibility to go to 
America if you got a family in
 America, and he had his fa

America. S o , he arranged everything little

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0067
 
 
 
45
pay fo r that, you know, and later on to
 repay. My husband did, he repay 
something, you know, later 
on, yeah. And they  brought us here to New York , we 
left in -- we came here March 23 or the 24
th
. I™m la -- the March -- it was in 
March. Was very rough riding. Very -- in  March the water was very bad. I was 
kind of s-seasick, and my little girl, too. 
But my husband, he didn™t. He -- he -- he 

was healthy. 
Q: Do -- do you remember the name of the ship? 
A: Marine -- Marine Jumper. Yes, I still
 got a picture from Marine Jumper, and 
were a lot of people, was crowded, I th
ink there were many families there, you

Q: How -- how long did the trip last
, roughly? Do you -- do you rememb er?

14 days, something like that.  
Q: Did you have -- did you have 
any money with you? I mean -- 
A: No, my  husband had five dollars, you 
know, I didn't had any money at all. 
Actually, my  money -- I had some money,
 but it wasn't worth it anything, you 
know, because that time, 
you know, and money wasn't -- it was, yeah, after the 
war, you know, wh en money wasn™t worth 
it -- anything. And we came to this 
country and I think on a -- on a ship that 
took good care of us, and when  we came 
here, also there -- there -- you know from fa
r away on a ship you saw that Statue 
of Liberty, so we all got up -- out on a -- high on a -- on a boat, on a ship, you 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0067
 
 
 
46
know, and lo oked at the Statue of Libe
rty. And it was some -- somehow in the 
mo rning, it was already daylight. And some
 people, the cooks 
over there, they 
were very generously done. They had some
 apple pie, blueberry pie, and my little 
girl, you know, she th -- the -- for the kids
 they  give everything th ere, the cooks, 
you know, everything there -- th
ere -- they want to get ri
d of the f-food, but they 
had -- people couldn™t eat o-on a ship b
ecause they were sick and all that. And 
then somebody came and called our names, th
at they took us to a train station. 
And the train goes to Utica. 

Q: Do you reme mb er anything
 about that train ride, looking at the country fo r the 
first time? 

A: Well, it was -- yeah, it was strange, I 
mean, you know, sure, and our little girl 
was running around, I had my  hands fu

scared, both. 

Q: And then -- and then you met 
Julian™s father? Tha -- actually -- 
A: No, actually -- actu ally, on a [indecipherab
le] that stepbrother from Julian came 

and stepmother. They picked
 us up and we never -- ma -- Julian never saw them, 
he didn™t know them. So, 
they took us to New York 
mills, and he never knew his 
father. I remember his father was sleeping 
on a couch, he got up and for the first 
time he saw his son. And he say, who is 
she? She™s my wife, my little daughter. 
Uh-huh. Do she speak Polish? No. And -- ok
ay. So it was kind of hard for me to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0067
 
 
 
47
communicate, but my  husband was good, he helped me a lot and he -- he was the -
- the -- my chief.  

Q: Was it a little bit lonely 
then, in the beginning? 
A: Yes it was, in the beginning, but we 
had each other, and we
 had our little girl. 
And -- 

Q: Di-Did Ju lian™s father or the brothers
 want to know? Di-D
id they understand 
what -- did they ha -- had th
ey kind of an understanding 
of wh at had happened  in -
- in -- in -- in Europe, and did they want
 to know about what happened to you? 
A: Well, yes, sort of, yeah. And I -- firs
t thing I remem -- important thing was to 
get a job. So  we wanted a -- a job and things, so -- 

Q: Did you both get a job? 

A: Yes, in about two weeks -- no, not quite two weeks, 
we both got the job in a 
cotton mill. I got a -- in a cotton mill as 
a w eaver, working -- fi
rst helpingout and 
then learn how to weave, and my husband 
got in the next fact -- there were three 
factories an d he got in the 
next one [indecipherable] in
 a washroom somehow the -
- the -- with the -- with th
e -- fr -- what came out from 
the weaving machine there 
-- there -- there, made the material over 
there, you know, for something. And -- 
Q: You didn™t speak any Eng
lish at the time, did you? 

A: No, not Polish either, ju
st a few  words my husband learned me -- teached me, 
thank you and good mo rning and good night
. It was hard. And then it was one lady 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0067
 
 
 
48
there at work, her name also was Frieda, 
Frieda Hartman, in German -- she spoke 
German to me. And there was one lady wo rk
ing there what she said she move out 
from a -- from the apartment 
she -- she go -- she moved in with her son. And then  
that Frieda said, where is the apartmen
t, you know. They said that was a small 
apartment. I said, I don™t care, you know, so
 long w-we are together, you know, in 
a small apartment, on our own. So  she took 
me to this apartment, he was a really 
nice man, he had a store -- grocery store downstairs and upstairs he had a few little 
apartments. And we got a apartment upst
airs andwe were 
so happy, and from

condition because that woman 
died and that house was ju

son, he was in a -- in a war, and he came
 back and he promis
ed God he gonna go 
for a minister, and he did. And [indeci

land was excellent, was 39 acre -- 40 acres of
 land there, and -- and we went there 
to look at the house and the land -- the 
land was excellent, I liked it, and the way 
the house was built, we said the house is 
repairable, it™s worth it to repair, and we 
did. My  husband had good friends, Polish 
one from his town  that came and helped 
him on a Saturday, Sunday I did th e cooking, and they  came and worked , and -- 

and -- and repaired the house and did th
e -- the fixing up the 
house and we were 
happy and we stayed there for five years. 
Q: Was it -- did it feel good to go back 
to something that you 
had done befo re -- 
A: Yes, yes. 
Q: -- or was it some thing th at you had to 
do, you really wanted to  do something 
else? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0067
 
 
 
50
A: Both, both, yeah. I knew I can do it beca
use I was raised like that, and if we™re 
gonna get this here, we can make a litt
le money, we can 
make a money. My 
husband started work ing on a constructi

we had chicken, I raised little baby chickens
, 300. And then they
™re turning in to 
be lay -- lay -- laying eggs an

we sold the eggs to the 
city. And later on we™re just keep them 
for two years, so they were hundred 
percent layhorn, you know, they  were -- we

of the chickens and then we start getting cattle. New wa -- new -- two cows and -- 

and young heifers, to -- I raise my self, I 
said, you know, so th
at™s what we did. 
Had 15 heifers and two cows,

 and make the money. We 
kept them heifers for th ree years, and they
 were already turning 
into be a cow. We 
sold them. We took them to
 the auction, we sold them
, we make a good money. 
And then we said now it™s 
time the children start going school, and it™s no -- no 
way to be on a farm so way up th ere in 
-- in -- in Vernon Center. Let™s go and see 
if -- they said it™s a good b

a four fami ly house. And 
we had a good people what we can borro
w some money, sell the farm, and ha -- 
made a little money on the side, and buy 
that house, you know? So we had a 
mortgage on it, but it wasn™t scary at all,
 the mo rtgage we paid out from the rent 
money, and later on even, we bought a ni
ce little camp on the water, also paid off 
from the rent money. And our childre n went to Holy Trinity School.

the way it was, you know?  
Q: When -- when you -- when
 you raised the children,

about how you wanted to raise them, so
mething th at was maybe like you were 
raised, or different from where you were ra

all  my  mo m, a n d  my  sisters. T h ey  were 
happy, very happy. 
And also some friends already,
 you know. [indecipherable], 
you know, so and so . And 
I thought they  still, you kn
ow, they still no want to 
speak to me, or the -- someth
ing -- I still got that guilty
 conscious, you know. And 
later on I ask my  sister what the people ta
lk about me now, how they th ink about. 
Oh, she said, you know, all right, she said
 that™s okay, you kn
ow, things. But you 
know, just so much, you kn

58
know, and th ings. Then later on they as
k them how we™re doing here, and they 
said good, good, and so and 
so to tell them -- 
told them that tim

we got our own home and we™re happy and then -- 

Q: Did -- did you f -- did you feel -- I 
me -- I don™t -- I don™t know how often you 
s -- you were in touch with -- with peop
le, but did you think th ere was a real 
change in -- in -- in -- 
A: Little bit. 
Q: -- thinking and in attitude? 

A: Yes, a little bit already, was a -- a ch
ange i-in -- you know 
that they accept me 
more than -- than, you know
, when I was -- before I le
ft. And when I went home 
the second time, was already better. Then 
I came with -- our daughter went to 
Austria for a couple of months. She was 
18 then, you know. And they  liked her a 
lot, you know, and they  loved her and late
r on my husband, we -- we all went to 
Austria. We -- we were quite ma -- more of
ten in Au stria. And th e mo re often they 
saw us, they accept us more and more a
nd more, you know. So, 
th ings worked out 
okay, you know, so -- 
Q: In -- in -- in general, were your child
ren interested to learn sort of where you 
were coming from and where Julian are comi
ng from, or was it not really a d -- a 
deep interest to find out more? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0067
 
 
 
59
A: Oh yes, they™re -- they
 ask, you know, oh yes, 
yes. And when  the children 
came, Fried a and Richard also was there, 
my  husband and me, and all our -- of th-
the daughters from my oldest
 sister, they made -- come
 to -- you know, pick -- 
they got a big backyard, it was in the su
mmer, you know, a big, beautiful garden. 
And they invite all the fam
ily, and even friends if y -- 
they want to come and see 
us and th ey put on a big, big party, yo
u know, so -- you know, all kind of food and 
they were really, really  nice to us, and 
I -- I gonna -- I -- we 
rememb er that, that 
they were so nice. And also the other gi
rl from the older sister, you know, she got 
a big farm and they  put on, you know, the 
best -- the best Sunday  afternoon what 
they can put on out in a ga
rden, with tables there,
 with about 30 people all 
together, and I think that -- they did really
 the best what they could do for us. And 
that felt good, that felt all very good 
fo r me, you know. I no feel like I™m, you 
know, guilty of the somethi
ng, you know. So every time,
 more -- the more often 
we came and other friends, they  invite me
, you know, invite us, we should come, 
but we never had a chance to. Some -- some
 of them died already, they™re gone 
forever. And some of them what we went 
to school, they always said, you know, 
want to see my sister. She write ever -- 
couple times a month, and she said, you 
know, certain ladies say hello to you and 
wish you the very best, and -- and they™re 
thinking of you and they ™re so happy th
at you -- you -- you -- you have a good life 
with your family, and -- and that you got 
a good husband and a good children and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0067
 
 
 
60
everything is worked  out go
od, you know. So that make
 me feel good, you know, 
it make me feel good. 
Q: Since we are talking about Austria, 
let me ask you this. Did you follow a little 
bit the recent political develo
pments in Austria, for inst
ance with Jorg Heider, who 
is an ultra Conservative being now part 
of the government. Do you follow th at? 
A: No, I™m just listen what I am -- I h
ear, but I would never 
ever -- politic never 
interested me, you know. So I, 
politic I throw away completely, it™s just out of my 
-- my -- my -- my life, I just 
n -- I™m not interested, yeah. 
Q: Well let™s go back to America then, an
d let me ask you about your children, 

though. Did the -- the camp experience for 
-- for both of you, and your experience 
during th e war, did -- did that come up wh
en they were smal
ler? D id they ask 
questions, or -- 

A: Well, when they were bigger already, 
you know, we explained to them, and we 
went there, and then -- then they understood what was this all about, and -- and 

why, you know, and things, and it™s hard to
 believe now in -- in the times now that 
something like that ever happened befo
re, you know? That -- to punish  someone 
for something like that, you know, if you 
fall in love, they punish someone like 

that and want to kill them, you know. 

Q: Did -- did they learn about the Holo ca
ust, or the -- the second World War in -- 

in school in any detail? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0067
 
 
 
61
A: Prob -- probably they di
d, you know, but I don™t kn
ow exactly the -- the -- how 
much, you know, but 
they know that was a bad wa
r, and there was a ba -- bad 
conditions for s -- a lot of people su
ffered, and it™s hard to explain. 
Q: Di -- after the war, in America, did 
you see the people again who were with 
you in Ravensbrück, or 
did you hear about them? 
A: No, I just heard from one lady, she -- 
th -- Rosie Yolkman. 
She was later on in 
government, a big -- big position sh e had over there. 

Q: She was a kapo, she was a kapo  

A: She was a -- she wa -- no, she was -- sh
 -- she was a blockalteste. She had th e 
whole block numb er on wh ere we were. She had to -- she was our boss, you know, 

our blockalteste. So -- 

Q: And she was -- she was Polish? 

A: No, she was a Vienna, Austrian. Ma
ybe Czechoslovakian, but she was in 
Vienna an d she spoke aust -- completely
 Austrian and that™s all I know, yeah. 
Q: Were there things in America that yo
u didn™t like as mu ch -- I mean, you liked 
a lot of things, I guess, but were there also
 so me things you didn't q u ite agree with 
or that you didn™t like, in the 
earlier years may b e, or later on? 
A: In this country, you 
mean? Well, that was -- I mi
ssed holidays like with my 
family, and -- but other hand, we work late
, we always together, with Julian, our 
children, and we had friends, a lot of fri
ends. And tha-that™s 
my  life, you know, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0067
 
 
 
62
the -- Julian and our children,
 you know, that™s my -- a
nd grandchildren now, you 
know, that™s our happiest life, yeah.  
Q: Did you -- do you feel there was any e
ffect on you by certain events in this 
country, like for instance the Civil Right
s movement when the -- you know, the -- 
did you -- did you know about that in -- 
in detail, were you interested in those 
kinds of -- 
A: No. Nothing interests me, 
I -- I no get involved with a
nything politic, it™s just -- 
to me it™s just out. 
Q: And do you feel that yo
ur -- your own su ffering, as -- as a Christian, as 
Austrian, has not been -- is -- is n o t qu
ite so ingrained in the consciousness of 
people here in America, that they don™t 
know quite as mu ch of 
was that than they 
know about the suffering, for 
instance, from Jewish people? 
A: I think they don™t believe it that some
thing like that happen. I don™t think that 
they believe in that, I don™t 
think so. I don™t think they 
believe that™s Austrian, if 
they na -- were a criminal or
 the something, that they 
-- that they put somebody in 
a concentration camp, you kn
ow. But the people what co
me from over there, they 
knew them -- them laws that time, you know, 
they said, oh yes we know that that -

- that was against the law, you know, to fall 
in love with foreigner at that time, you 
know, that was very much 
against the law, you know. But that we had to go 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0067
 
 
 
63
through something awful like that, and -- bu
t just God was with us, God was good 
wi -- to us that we made it, you know, so -- 
Q: Did you have any -- could you give an
y particular ex ample when you realized 

that people really don™t know th at mu ch, 
when you told them 
that you were in a 
camp, and there was maybe somebody responding in  a certain way? 

A: I don™t think they want to -- they want 
to listen. And they not -- they don™t want 
to know nothing about it, you 
know, so that just not mu ch
 to talk about, you know, 
to them, you know, so that™s
 why I keep -- keep it inside and oh, Julian and -- and 
me, we can  talk together, because we know
 wh at we had to go through and what 
was all about. 

Q: When  you talked  -- when  you gave the 
first interview, the videotaped interview 
for the Ho locaust Museum, was that the fi
rst time you ev er really spoke about that 
experience? 

A: Yes, yes, I always -- y-yes. When we
 were young we didn™t had time to think 
about, we were so busy with work ing, 
children and our life and things like. I 
always pushed it away. Sometime it came in
to my  mind, oh, but I always pushed  it 
away and -- and I don™t want to think ab out. That was like a dream, you know, 
something in -- and that™s just -- h ad to 
go away again, you 
know. But when I -- 
we went to the Holo caust mu
s -- that time when we had th e interview, that night, 
you know, I was thinking -- all night I di
dn™t sleep and I wa
s thinking from the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0067
 
 
 
64
first day what happened and wh at we ha
d to go th rough. I was shook up, I mean, 
you know, I really was thinking to the 
bottom you know, how th
at happened, what 
happened , you know. Because I always push
ed it out of my  -- out of my  mind, you 
know, before, you know. I don™t want to th

didn™t do any crime, it was no crime, 
it was just their -- their life there, for wh
at -- what they came
 from,  you know, like 
-- like the -- the -- the -- all 
kind, like the Gypsies, ther
e were Gypsies there, an d 
wer -- there were the Jehovah Witness ther
e, and there were so man y  young girls 
there. And politician also, what they -- th
