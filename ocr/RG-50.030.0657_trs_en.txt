Jewish people I have not seen drunk. So
 th at Œ we knew that. And so Œ but the 
Lithuanians used to 
[indecipherable]
 to drink. And we, the kids, we Œ we didn™t 
had much. Playing, I know that my friends 
used to play there,
 because they lived 
together. There was a Jewish family livin

they lived together 
with Jewish family. 
And then  was Œ used to be laba Œ very inte
resting that Jews used to call us, the kids, 
to slaughter their chickens, 
because they couldn™t do that 
themselves. So they say, 
hey, come on and make that. And I know Œ 
Q: Have you slaughtered a chicken?

Q: Why would you say 
Œ why would that be? 
A: The religion. 

Q: You think, yeah? 

A: Religion. Religion is the Œ you see, I™m 
[in d ecipherable]

recognized that the religion is very 
detrimental to our relationship 
with  every Œ ev eryone else. 
Q: How sad. 
A: Yeah.  
Q: How very  sad. 

A: Because that is Œ that Œ that™s Œ that 
Œ you cannot associate. My first wife was 
Lutheran, my daughters ar

cuma

cannot be godfather. He went to priest a

said no way. Can you

United States

 was married with a 
Grigolyte
(ph). 
Q: And what™s that? Who™s that? 
A: That the name, 
Grigolyte

ch Nazi. And I remember

Hitler 
took over, he used 
to argue with my father 
Œ my father. They were al
ready their time. And my

very  mu ch. They didn™t speak Lithuanian . In 
Klaipeda
, in 
that time, the kids were almost th e same 
age like my family, and they really Œ and I 
used to Œ we used to go to

Klaipeda 
was the Œ the 
Œ that was the city of Œ of
 envy. Everything was in 
Klaipeda
. Even the smell was

that 
villis

Q: Your cousin. 
A: My cousin. He was a year older, and we
 used to sleep in on
e bed and kick each 
other, one for 
Smetona
, one for 
Hitler
. That time I already knew 
Germany
, what is 
going in 
Germany
, because 
Klaipeda 
was very much for 
Adolf
. 
Q: Tell me, how far was 
Klaipeda 
from 
Kretinga
? 
A: 24 kilometers. 
Q: So it™s like 15 miles.

Smetona
. 
Smetona 
give so mu ch money to every Na

Klaipeda Œ 
Q: Okay . 

A: Œ for 
Lith uania
 was like a punishment for all in

they will Œ will send to 
Klaipeda
. 
Q: You mean if you™re a government official?

Klaiped Œ 
A: They exiled to 
Klaipeda
. 
Q: And why is it a punishment? Why would it be a punishment? 
A: Because 
Klaipeda
 was little bit odd. 
Klaipeda
 was not 
Lithuania
. Was more 
German. The culture, everyt
hing. Luth eran. All of 
Klaipeda
 was Lutheran. So 
that™s my Œ that™s my Œ that I Œ I didn™t 
mean anything Œ that™s my  impression, and I 
think I am right. There were 
the Œ the Œ the Œ a friction. 
Q: So was it German Lithuanian friction? 
A: The German, 
Memelland
. Memel Œ 
[indecipherable]
 minor Lithuanian friction. 
Q: So Œ 

 
Interview with Pranas Jurkus

A: Because the Lithuanians, th
ey do not accept 
the kla Œ the 
Memellander
 as a full 
Lithuanian. 
Q: And why wouldn™t they? 
A: Lutheran . 
Q: I see. A nd is that why th
ey were more pro-Nazi than 
Memellander
? 
A: And then  many, many Œ 

Q: Okay . 
A: Œ 
Klaipeda 
ci Œ 
Klaipeda 
citizens were sympathizing with 
Hitler
. 
Hitler
 
promised many, many things, and it wa
s easy for him to take over the 
Klaipeda
 
1939, what was March, or whatever. 

Q: Do you rememb
er that time? 
A: Oh, I remember.

Kre-Kretinga
. 
Q: So you had this 
onslaught of people? 
A: Yes, yes.

ng on? Did they tell stories of what was 
happening? 
A: We knew that. We knew that, we didn™t like that. 
Q: What did you hear, what did 
you know? Because we don™t know. 
A: So th at 
Hitler
 took over 
Lithua nia
, part of
 Lithuania
. That™s like Œ like Polish 
and 
Vilnius
, exactly the same. W e in school Œ you
 know, in school in ™37 - ™38, we 
were already enlightened about the politics with 
Vilnius
. Every mo rning in Œ in 
grammar school, we stand up, we
 look at east, and we say 
[speaks Lithuanian]
. 
We will not be satisfied without 
Vilnius
. So with 
Klaipeda
, when 
Klaipeda
 was 
taken over, 
Klaipeda 
is ours.

of that. Please explain it all. 
A: Oh. It was 1940 - ™41. 
Q: Okay . 
A: Already 
Hitler 
took Œ no, 1940. 1940, when  
the first Soviet occu pation. 
Q: Okay . 
A: At one time, 
Germ any
 agreed with 
Sov iet Union
, they will exchange. 
Q: Exchange what? 
A: The Lithuanians from 
Klaipeda
 or from 
Germany
, who are Lithuanians 
patriots, want to come 
Œ [break] Œ Lithuania 
back, who stayed th
ere. They didn™t 
like the 
Hitler
 regime, they wanted
 to come to Œ to 
Lithuania
, and the Lithuanians, 
whoever knew what the 
Soviet Union
 brought us, they cl
aimed that they are 
Lutherans, they are Germans,
 they claim that they have
 relatives so meplace, and 
they could prove to the Soviet governme
nt, they were let out. And th at was the 
exchange, repatriation, what you call in 
Lithuania
. And my  mo ther™s brother,

Tarmynas

he was trusted Soviet citizen, let™
s say, he was given a position in 
keda ina i
(ph) or 
someplace. And we say, why do you do th
at? He couldn™t unde
rstand, he didn™t 
want to live under 
Hitler
. But we knew already th at.  
Q: So you Œ 
A: There are two devils; one is brown, 
one is red. And to choose between two 
devils, you rather would choos
e the brown. That time, really I™m not lying, that time 
was already evident that the 
Soviet Union
 was cruel. Because immediately, you 
remember, when they 
took the Œ immediately  they de
-d eported so many people and 
everything, so that Œ 
Q: Okay, we™ve gotten ahead of
 ourselves a little bit. 
A: Oh yeah, little bit, okay. 

Q: But Œ so the first time that I sense that th
eir Œ that this world that you describe to 
me in  
Klaipeda
 has a huge chan ge, is when 
Hitler
 takes over 
Memel
 and klai Œ the 
first time Œ  

A: Yeah. 

Q: Œ yeah , that 
Kretinga
, the world that you lived 
in gets changed, is when

A: The first exodus Œ 
Q: The first exodus. 
A: Œ befo re 
Hitler™s 
army marched in, they
 knew that they will march in that and 
that day, so that all the L
ithuanians, where they  could, they  got everything Œ they  
could take everything what th
ey wanted, they went to L
ithuanian  side because they 
knew that after 
Hitler 
will take over, or that 
Germany
 will take over, that you have 
no choice then. 

Q: Okay, so here™s another question, when
 those Lithuanians came, and I said, well 
what did they say, and you Œ you said, well, that 
Germany™s
 taken over, I™m going 
after more of, let™s say  their experiences,

before, was known for politicians that 
Klaipeda
 will be taken away because the war 
around, th ey were taking 
Czechoslovakia
, they™re taking there and there and there, 
that
 Klaipeda

scriminating, the Lithuanians already in

A: A Œ not talking Lithuanian
 in  stores, and the government was quite dominated by 
Œ by German Œ by

the farmer who was Œ no Œ and 
Œ and that was Œ was quite 
Œ and the city was terrible 
Œ terrible atmo sphere in the city, and Œ an
d just depressed, people depressed. People 
could not believe that the Germans could do th at.  
Q: And were they Œ di
d they talk about it? 
A: They talked just Œ just very mute. 
Q: Very quietly then. 

A: Very quietly. They Œ th
ey didn™t want to talk. N
obody wants to talk about 
anything that time. The kids, we talked th
at we saw that and that and so on. Now, 
that time w h en they ended, 
they  an nounced  that next Sunday the same. Now, not to 

extend th -the story, next Sunday was the 
same. The same people down. There is an-
another probably  30. They caught another 
bunch of hidden pe
ople. And the ones 
who were already dirty, with Œ with  
Œ w-with the Œ with
 the wounds, with 
everything, and I saw how the German, with 
Œ with Œ with sword,
 cut one, the ear 
was hanging here, I saw that. You imagine, 
how could I live not Œ not putting th is to 
history? Was hanging. I don™t know if th 
Œ he survived  or not
, but that time when 
they ran around. Now the pe
ople came and you could det
ect which one was torture 
already, which came with the nice suit, nice 
shirt and everything. And after a half an 
hour, they  all looked the same. The same 
scenery, the same torture, the same  
beating. Now, if the same so
ldiers beat, I cannot tell. I don™t recognize that Œ that Œ

the Germans. All uniforms, and only wa
s summertime, and you know how th ey 
were Œ 
Q: What color were the uniforms? 
A: Greenish. Infantry. Infantry 
SS
. Not the black. 
Q: Okay , and so  they weren™
t Œ and th ey weren™t regular 
Wehrmacht
? As far as Œ 
A: Not the regular wehr Œ regular 
Wehrmacht
, only about five were guardin g 
around, because, you know, they
 feared that could escape
, could run or
 Œ or Œ or 
jump someplace. And second time. Now, 
second time, there were no people 
looking. Germans were angry, and I think 
they told through th
e translator that Œ 
why people don™t want to see those vertrai Œ those Œ 
Q: Say it in German. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Those what? 

A: Those 
[indeciphera ble]
 that Œ that™s Œ no Œ criminals Œ

I should have turned

Q2: Do  you want me to pause? 
Q: Yes, please.

[break]  
Q: I™m sorry for the interruption. Can 
you tell me the second time you saw th ese 
events, you say the German
s were angry that no Œ 
A: There were no spectators. 

Q: That™s right. 
A: Or lack of spectators what they expected. 
Q: Okay . 

A: They expected Œ that 
is my assumption Œ they e
xpected there would be, you 
know, enjoyment to everyone. Enjoyment?
 You see wh at enjoyment, you know. 
You torture animals, you don™t have enjo
yment. Anyway, and the same procedure. 
Reviving was dragged into the pond and ba
ck , revived and beaten, beaten, beaten 
until they  couldn™t walk or so. And I rememb er that time, I don™t know if I was until 
the end or not, they  were ag
ain put in the prison, and supposed to  be third Sunday. 
You imagine, every Sunday  was spoiled for all the 
Kretinga
 that Œ that walk, the

122
people™s enjoyment, with that kind of thi
ngs. And I didn™t see that Œ the third one, I 
don™t remember. And if I would remember, 
I would repeat the same. Is irrelevant 
now, that Œ that Œ that Œ 
but some told me that even
 was just a few people, the 
fourth Sunday. I Œ I don™t know. I men
tion in my writing that Œ that somebody 
claims, but I Œ I don™t Œ I don™t want. No 
Œ and Œ and that was 
over, and all what I 
have seen. But I Œ 
Q: And then Œ and then you as Œ do you a
ssume that then if they weren™t killed 
during th is kind of torture, then they Œ th
o-tho-those who surviv ed
 were simply shot 
later? 

A: Shot later. No Œ no one su
rvived. No one. If th
ey didn™t die there at the place, the 
torture place, they died in th
e prison. They Œ they were no
t fed, they were not Œ not 
Œ no Œ not care, nothing. 
[indecipherable]
 yeah. 
Q: And did you n Œ di
d any of the people look familia
r? Would they 
Œ did you know 
to Œ nothing.  
A: Not one man, not Œ not 
one. Probably so me Œ some recognized, but I don™t. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: I Œ I didn™t recognize any one. 
Q: The second time when

some teenagers.

not like the first time Œ 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ that everybody do Œ what Œ what Œ wh
at will be there. Because that Œ that Œ 
Q: Was this Œ 

A: Œ sa Œ sane people cannot stand it. 
Q: Well, here™s another question. You say th
at Œ you say that Œ that they ruined  the 
Sunday, you know, the Œ th
e Sunday walk. But was that
 the reason why people 
didn™t talk, or Œ or was it 
that they were horrified? 
A: Horrified. I Œ I would assume. The Œ 
now I™m just speculating, I™m guessing. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: They were Œ they were stunned that
 why they should do th at? The first 
[indecipherable]
 they were put in  the Œ in  the Œ in th e ditches and shot, and that™s 
it. You know, that Œ that™s something else, but the torture. And you know, like si Œ 

little bit Œ little bit e-e-ex-ex-exploring that, the 
NKVD
, or the Œ the Russians 
tortured, but Germans don™t torture. They 
exterminate, b u t they
 don™t torture. But 
why they  Œ why they  wanted this one Œ an
d I don™t believe that such a Œ such a 
program was anyplace else. I have not heard, and like 
Eidintas
 did not write?

so, they knew that, 
Kretinga

Why nobody el Œ calls 
Pranas

have seen. No. No one. It seems 
that I™m li Œ like a Œ like a liar. 
Q: You feel that? 
A: You know, I was disappointed. I was 
disappointed  with you a little bit, you 
know, that you don™t call. Because I 
said why? Because no Lithuanian was 
participating. This atrocity, done in 
Lithuania
, in my hometown, and done by 
Germans. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Ca Œ to show Lithuanian
s. You know Lithuanian, there 
were Lithuanian tortured 
my  Germans, too, oh, concen tration camp

Kaunas 
fort, Fort Five, or whatever. 
Q: The Ninth Fort. 

A: Yeah. Was there more? Wa
s there more? No, they were
 shot, were shot. But not 
such a thing. And I could give you the Œ 
the Œ the place, the Œ where the people 
were, where the torturing were, how it was, 
how th e pond is. I could draw you a Œ a 
map .  

Q: Tell me, when  Œ the second time you went
, and you came home,
 did your parents 
still not want to talk about it? Did 
you tell your parents what you saw? 

A: They didn™t ask me, they didn™t ta
lk. Becau Œ I Œ we were very free
 Lithuania

h, but where you go in summertime, w h at 

you do Œ we didn™t work, you know.

how Œ how to describe the tragedy. In this
 age, when  Œ oh, when
 I tell you, I Œ I 
could say that tragedy the top 
of the world, but that time? 
Even t of the day. Event of 
the day. Cruel, yes. Like I sa
y, if somebody h-hits me or 
Œ or Œ or pokes me, it hurts 
me. I know that people hurt. The people 
hurt, but there was such a notion that 
guilty, guilty. Who is guilty? No
 one is guilty, guilty ta Œ 
the one who is doing that.  
Q: What I™m trying to get a sense of, is how
 did it work in side of you wh en you see 
this? Were you numb, were yo
u sh Œ were you terrorized,
 were you stunned, were 
you Œ 
A: I was terrorized, I was Œ at that time? 
Q: At that time. 

A: At that time I was n either terrorized nor
 stunned. Astonish ed little bit that I Œ I 
witnessed such a thing, and it was inside
 me which I carried when I Œ I said I 
carried so many years. So many years, I 
had no one to  talk, no 
one would actually Œ

A: Slaughter. And th e editor did not had time to
 read that or to give me a comments. 
And I was little bit unhappy wh
en Œ when Œ when, and she 
never returned that to

I only gave to my  sister. My sister said, 
I was three or four years younger, I don™
t rememb er mu c h . Sh e on ly reme mb ered  
that she saw some torturing Œ Soviets to
rture Lithuanians. She was that, as a 
schoolgirl, put that Œ to look at that. Sh

dn™t talk, they 
were stunned in the town. Th
at you haven™t heard of anyt
hing else that happened in 
quite such a similar fashio
n elsewhere. What Œ did an
y Œ did life normalize at any 
point, or do you think 
Kretinga
 was changed forever? 
A: I think it was Œ was fairly normalized
. Normali Œ the front was far away. There 
was already 
Ka un a s
 taken, was 
Vilnius
 taken, the Germans were in Œ in 
Russia
. 
German administratio n, the military admi

German administratio n, although the lowe

because you don™t know. So me people were taken, deported. 
Q: To 
Germany
. 
A: To 
Germany
. Some girls who were a little bit l
oose, they were pointed out and 
the Germans took th em to 
Germany
. There were no mass deportations to 
Germany
 
for work. Lithuanians were not in that

in Œ no Œ no Œ no in tention. And some
 people who lived there, not far away, 
although it was far away to 
[indecipherable]
 is that Œ that™s like a Œ like a free land. 
The Jewish cemetery was very isolated by
 woods, by trees, and so that nobody 
heard, nobody Œ nobody knew. And I think 
there were some incidents. You know, 
we still had German o
ccupation for years.  

Q: But that™s what I want to find out about. 

A: Yeah. But that™s non-event. It was wa

German doctor didn™t come, there were no

y sensed that she Œ you know how

en when she died, 
my father was little bit on edge. He didn™t
 know how to cook, he didn™t know how 
to do anything, laundry or anything. My  el
der sister was a dame. She never peeled a 

potato, she never di

how to cook, because my Œ 
my mother was my friend. 
Our father was the girls™

and Father was very angry many times. I Œ I had th e Œ 
Q: You didn™t cook as well, did you?

to disappear. And that was for me a good Œ

know, speculation, all kind of things. 

Q: I want to ask something, going back to 
the main topic of our Œ of our discussion. 
And that is, did what you see with that to

those Jewish men, did that change you? 
Did you feel like you Œ so mehow or other it

en I was young, I was little
 bit, you know, edgy and 
so, you know, 
[indecipherable]
 and Œ and hitting something.
 After that, I had never 
had a fight in my life.  
Q: So after you saw such things. 

A: Ne Œ te Œ but I Œ I kind of Œ I kind of 
grew up very early. Bu
t I was in a Œ in a 
Germany
, or Œ or something, or Œ or some
 disagreement with some friend or 
something, I never wanted to get in a fight. 
Not that I was afraid that I will not win. 
You know, you just protect yo
urself. But no, but just Œ ju st a Œ now, when I see 
grown people fighting, or the lithu Œ yo
u know, Lithuanian fights, especially 
[indecipherable]
 you know, when  Œ when  they Œ 
they  get drunk and they fight. 
And I never smoked in my  life and I don™t dr
ink. I drink socially, but I Œ my  father 
was drinking and I swore to myself, I will 
not subject my family what he subjected 
us. And there is a story, laughing story to tell.

ey  showed  pictures, and after that they 
showed the Germans, how 
they have to go to 
Dachau

 th e Germans claim Œ probably th is is 
not, but the Germans claim that we didn™t 
know. Yeah , you didn™t know, but feel 

the guilt. Feel. Because yeah, this was your
 people You elect na Œ not elected, but 
you supported 
Adolf

everything was okay. When  is bad, then

Q: No. 

A: Germans fought quite a bit against that.  

Q: There were some. 

A: But about Germans in Œ in 
Klaipeda

Q: The other thing I wanted to ask you about
 is that it took a long time, if we talk 
about 2010, when  you wrote this artic
le and you had it pub
lished Œ maybe you 
passed it in 2008, but it sat in you for a 
long time, until you were ready to  speak.

A: I think I mentioned a little b
it that I was not sure if I sh
ould reveal this. I was Œ I 
knew that one day, after me, or before me 
or whatever, I have to tell. But there was 
my personal neglect. I always set prioritie
s. You know, to sit such a article, you 
have to sit, you have to c
oncentrate, you have to have time. I was work ing. I was Œ I 
had this tough Œ tou
gh job. I had the Œ I was in

Citibank
 
international banking, 
Cleveland

 I Œ I Œ I couldn™t tell anyone. I couldn™t 
tell anyone.

is I didn™t share. 
Q: Did you share it with your wife, or your kids? 
A: My wife? 
Q: Yeah.

d not, at least part translate to o. 
Q: Now, I want to ask you. You menti
oned in your book th
at you wrote about 
everything, but you didn™t write about this 
part in your book, about what happened 
to the Jews. 

A: No, I didn™t write, I didn™t. 
Q: And why would that be? 
Why would you leave it out? 

A: Well, because that Œ but that time, wh
at I wrote in that book, I wrote my high 
school, how I left 
Lithuania
 and how I started high school in 
Germany
. 
Q: Oh, so you li Œ you do

A: No. 
Q: Okay .

Germany

America

A: They wanted that I Œ I write again and 
now they are asking me, and I mu st admit, 
I Œ I am newly married, and I Œ I don™t ha
ve time. I don™t have the patience, I don™t 
have time. And that book wa
s published when my firs
t wife was already with  
Alzheimer™s
. 
Q: Oh dear. 

A: And I was in such a hurry, I ask my frien
ds, group, we had the group, that we all 
contribute. If we publish the book, each one 
part. And I waited three or four years; 
nobody responded 
like to this article. 
Nobody wants to talk. 
Q: Why? Why do you th
ink that™s the case? 

A: Yeah. No body Œ nobody calls me, nobo
dy there. There probably are some 
Lithuanians someplace, but no. 

Q: Nobody was interested in 
wh at you had revealed there? 
A: No, no. And wh en I ask, di Œ have y

at happened  someplace else, and I would 
like to Œ what my mother to
ld, I would like to write, or
 whatever. And that™s it, 
yeah. And that™s little bit, ki
nd of angered me that was 
not enough response for th Œ 
[break] 
Œ and I hope, therefore that this will 
be the contribution to your museum, 
and to th e relationship between the Jews, 
the folks, and the 
Lithuanian folks. 
Q: Thank you. Thank you very mu ch. If there™
s anything else you™d like to add, that 
I haven™t talked 
to you about Œ 
A: Noth ing. I Œ I wanted, because there is no 
lie, nothing is a lie. So if Œ if there is 
some doubt, there is not intentionally
, but probably . Because I went to 
Lithuania
 
special, on a trip. I went there, I measured
, I looked. I walked 
around the pond, and 
this one, that I don™t make mistake. And in  th
at article is mu ch mo
re than I told you 
today. An  explicit. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: What was on one side, what was on other 
side, how that was. Is Œ is much better 
expressed that I expressed in my  report now. 
Q: But tell me, did people in 
Kretinga
 read this article? 
A: I gave to  my  relatives, the day we delivered to 
Kretinga 
newspapers. I don™t 
know. You know that
