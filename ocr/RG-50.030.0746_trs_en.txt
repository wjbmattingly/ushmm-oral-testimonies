Question:  So this the Unite
d States Holocaust Memorial 
Museum interview with Walter 
Meyer conducted by William M eineke, on 
May 19th, 2010 in 
the U.S. Holocaust 
Memorial Museum in Washington 
D.C. So Herr Meyer, good mo rn ing.
 
Answer:  Good 
morning to you.
 

Q:  So could you tell me a l
ittle bit about your life, your 
Å’ your early -- the earliest you 
can remember?
 
A:  Well, I was born in Kassel, 
which is very much in the cent
er of Germany.  My father 
worked for the Henschel
 Company, so that's 
pretty mu ch the mo st important factory in 
Kassel.  The Henschel were famous for maki
ng lo como tives, and later on, they made the 
famous Henschel airplane.  That's where I 
was, and my mother disliked Kassel very 
much.  That's where the Linde
nhessen (ph) lived there, very, very unpleasant people, 
mo stly Protestant.  I was the only Catho
lic, so they called me the Katholische 
Rattenschwanz.
 
Q:  Catholic rattail?
 
A:  Catholic rattail, and so then my father
 eventually secured a job as director of 
Feindliche Industrial Refri
geration Company in Dusseldo
rf, and so we moved there.
 
Q:  How old were you?
 
A:  When  I was 11, maybe 12, an d of course 
there was a change then, a different school, 
different environment.  I joined the swim
ming club and became part of the Jungvolk, 
which is the early stage of the Hitler Youth,
 divided in Ju ngvolk, 
Hitler Youth and then 
 
of course the armed forces, and at 14, I join ed -- or better said, I had to join the Hitler 
Youth, which was an organization from 14 to  18 and it was very mu ch a premilitary 
preparation.
 
Q:  Did you like the Hitler Youth, I m
ean what kind of activities did you do?
 
A:  Oh, it was very nice.  We liked it very mu
ch because we had, I -- oh, let me explain.  
The Hitler Youth was divided 
like the armed  forces into 
Navy, Army and so on, Air 
Force, and as a swimmer, I joined the Navy 
and was trained to be
come an underwater 
demolition expert. So what we le
arned there was rather interes
ting, spent a lot of time in 
the water.  Didn't have to go to  church 
because services were generally on Sunday 
mornings purposely, traveled 
a lot to compete in other cities of Germany, camaraderie, 

nice friends, yes. And Nazis as such or the 
philosophy of national socialism didn't enter 
our brain very much; we were a little too youn
g to understand all that.  We saw  more or 

less the victorious aspect of Germany, that
 means coming up with 
something new in the 
industry and designing a new airplane and 
being numb er one in th is and so on, and 
eventually of course came th
e war.  So the answer to you
r question was I liked it very 
much, yes, it was very enjoyable.  It was 
like -- like in a way lik
e somebody join ing the 
Boy Scouts here.
 
Q:  Well, what was the week like?  So how 
often would you 
go to the Hitler Youth, what 
would you do in th
e Hitler Youth --
 

A:  Every week.
 
Q:  -- in a week?  So once a week?
 
A:  Yes, every week, Sunday, every week.  
Of course the coaching -- swimming coaching 
was three times a week  but then Hitler Y
outh services was Sunday and there were 
holid ays wh ere we had to meet and march a
nd sing and so on, yeah.  So th ere were 
special meetings, let's say, on the 1st of
 May we would -- we would be driven  to 
Nuremberg to march there with 
the flags and so on, you know, 
and I swam in Stuttgart.  I 
swam in Breslau, I swam in Ried (ph) in Austria, so...
 
Q:  What was your sport, what was your event?
 
A:  I swam 100-meter breast stroke.  At that 
time, shortly after I star
ted, breast stroke was 
divided 100 strokes to swim butterfly and breast stroke
, and butterfly didn't have a 
dolphin kick  but it had a breast stroke kick, so
 there has been a quite an evolution in  
swimmin g .
 
Q:  And you were successful?
 
A:  Pardon?
 
Q:  You were a successful swimmer?
 
A: Yeah, I was quite successful, yes, and then  later on I became the goalie because the 
goalie of the German water polo team had a fata
l accident so they we
re looking for one, 
and during a little train ing 
period, I played goalie and I was 
pretty good, so they asked me 
to stay.  So I became th e goalie of the wate
r polo team, and that was more fun than 
anything, except we played a lot in -- outside
 and sometimes the water was about 14, 16, 
ice cold, ice cold.  
So, yeah, but it was enjoyable b
ecause it was a camaraderie and...
 
Q:  Did you have cla
sses in Nazi,  you know --
 
A:  We had classe s, ye s.  We had classe s a
nd learned many th ings th
eoretically, others in 
practice, lik e the language of the flags and so
me Morse alphabet, et cetera, et cetera, 
those.  Learned ab out Bruttoregistertonnen, what
 all that meant, the size of a ship and so  
on. The armed forces or the H
itler Youth equal to the armed fo
rces was also divided into 
ranks, like the GI and the corporal and the -- and 
so on.  So many of 
the guys I didn't  like 
became lieutenants and captains a
nd I had to salute them, and 
I didn't like that idea very 
much because I had absolutely
 no respect for them.  I t
hought they were a bunch of 
sissies.  So that brought upon the first re
sentment, the first problems and that --
 
Q:  How about school?
 
A:  School?
 

Q:  What was school like?
 
A:  Oh, well, school was of course corporal 
punishment.  If you didn't
 behave, you had to 
wait to until physical education class when y
ou had nothing but your 
shorts on, bend over 
and there was a little b u mble stick and so..
 
Q:  Do you remember any teachers?
 
A:  Huh?
 
Q:  Do you remember a
ny teachers from that time?
 
A:  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  Oh yes.
 
Q:  Who, for example?
 
A:  I had Dr. Bach (ph) was probably my favor
ite teacher.  He eventually left because he 
was a reserve officer in World War I.  He was 
a captain and so he stayed in th e reserve 
and then  left and that was -- that was bad b
ecause I missed him very much.  He was the 
way a teacher is supposed to be.
 
Q:  So how?
 
A:  Yeah.
 
Q:  So how is a teach
er supposed to be?
 
A:  Yeah, he taught well.  He shared.  He 
considered and expected
 students to listen to 
him, to obey, but he was fair in everything, 
so I was one of the top students while he was 
there.
 
Q:  What subject did he teach?
 
A:  What?
 
Q:  What subject?
 
A:  He taught German, German grammar and hi
story.  Yeah, I think th at was it, but he 
was what is called a Klassenlehrer, that mean
s the principal teacher, and besides that, and 
of course we had the biology teacher, the one
 who taught physics an
d chemistry, one who 
taught geography.  And then as the teachers le
ft because they had to
 join the Army, we 
had women teachers, and the poor
 ladies, we made their life so
, so difficult.  Oh God, I 
felt sorry for them.
 
Q:  How did you make their lives difficult?
 
A:  Well, I remember one da
y I brought home a little piec
e of reproduce but identical 
looking pile of dog poo poo, okay.  And 
th en another guy brought some kind of 

phosphorous thing that stank like hell so we put
 this close to the pult (ph), you know, and 
then everybody in the classroom {Sniffing so
unds} and then the teacher started {Sniffing 
sounds} and then sh e said oh, God, and then  
everybody laughed like hell.  So things of 
that nature, you know, and...
 
Q:  Did you have a best 
friend, did you have a pal?
 
A:  Now, I don't know best friend.  I had so
me Jewish friends, but 
I liked them mo stly 
because when I went to their 
homes they had always an asso
rtment of cookies.  I mean 
Jewish mothers are very, very, very nice ladi
es.  So yeah, I liked them, got along well 
with them.
 
Q:  Were they in
 class with you?
 
A:  Yeah.
 
Q:  How were they treated in class?
 
A:  Like everybody else, yeah.  Things
 began to -- began to change after the 
Kristallnacht, that was a change
, and th en of course they ha
d to wear the David Star and 
then, well, then --
 
Q:  Can you describe
 how things changed?
 
A:  Huh?
 
Q:  Can you describe
 how things changed after Kris
tallnacht, do you rememb er any --
 
A:  Well, we non-Jews were then taught, I 
think th e biology teache
r taught us what the 
typical Jew was like.  He was only interested 
in making money.  He 
could not be found in 
professions like farmer or work  with his hands; businessman, money changer and so  on.  
Then the physical attributes, their noses, flat 
feet and so on, we lear
ned ab out that, and we 
were told then to st
ay away from them
, to -- not to have any ki
nd of association with 
them.
 
Q:  How did your Jewish friends in the class react?
 
A:  Huh?
 
Q:  How did your Jewish friends who were in 
class with you, how di
d they react to that?
 
A:  They  were kind of the silent partners of 
-- of -- of -- of the geschenes  (ph), things 
happened  but they were kind 
of shaken or didn't know wh at to say or not to say.
 
Q:  Do you think a lot of the boys believe
d -- believed wh at they
 were being told ?
 
A:  Yes.
 

Q:  Did you believe wh at
 were you being told ?
 
A:  Something I didn't believe, 
I questioned it, because I had su
ch a good experience with 
the freundlich and the frohliche and the famili
es with whom I had a very nice contact, 
they were nice to me, so I said why, and I me
an we had Jewish neighb
ors.  So of course 
while this was going on, on th e 
other hand, we got indoctrina
tion in every way possible, 
newspapers, Sturmer, education, the teachers
.  I mean we were fed entire Judaism from 
left and right, and I assume that some 
-- some -- some youngsters probably asked 
themselves whether there was 
not something true about those things.  My question was 
once wh en  the persecution started, I helped on
ce as an altar boy, and I didn't like the 
chaplain very much b
ecause he's always late, I had to 
wake him up, but one day I asked 
him, I said, why is there so much hatred?  
I mean Jesus was Jewish.  It's there written on 
the cross, I N RI, Jesus von Nazareth, Konig de
r Juden.  Walter, you'r
e not allowed to ask 
questions.  You have to believe.  So I felt that
 was rather stupid as anything I ever heard 
and -- but I didn't  say anything, but I was 
dumbfounded, let's put it that way. And my  
father was extremely critical.  My father wa
s in World War I from th e first day till the 
last day.  He was in every major battle.  
He w as wounded three times and he was very 
much anti Hitler, and he heard -- listened to
 the NBC or CBS, NBC,
 CBS -- CBS, and my 
uncle told  him, be careful, they're going to  catc
h you one of these days, you'll end up in a 
concen tration camp.
 
Q:  So BBC, yeah?
 
A:  Huh?
 
Q:  BBC?
 
A:  BBC.
 
Q:  British Broad
casting Corporation?
 
A:  British, British, yeah.  And so what this
 little Hitler, what he expects going to Russia, 
I mean he's  going to  bleed to death and all th
ese poor young boys will 
be killed.  So that 
was kind of my father's spiel,
 but he very soon, thanks to 
his knowledge of languages, in 
this case, F rench, he sp oke Fr
en ch fluently , he became the liaison officer for the French 

heavy industry during the Ge
rman occupation with headqu
arters in Lille, northern 
France, so I didn't see mu ch of him.  And I 
had lost my  brother in mountain climbing.  He 
fell to his death.  So it was my mother and I, 
and then  I didn't  spend mu ch time in school.  
I spent -- I mean much
 time at home.  And a -- well, the day came when  the school 
expelled me.
 
Q:  Oh, why?
 

A:  Because the windowsill of the old school
 building, there was a board, and from the all 
the rain throughout the years 
and years and years had become
 brittle, and you could pick 
it up.  And I said oh, that would be wonderful 
to just let's it sail dow
n, and so one of the 
classmates, I says said when  somebody come
s let me know.  So mebody came.  Well, that 
somebody was a teacher, he just 
walked by, and it ended on the 
back of his head and then 
of course went into 1,000 
pieces, and I was called and D
r. Fettweiss (ph), he was the 
director, the principal.  Nobody want to say 
anything, so we had th ese big lush ey ebro ws, 
and he went to one, did you do it?  Did you 
do it?  When he came to me, I broke down 
and I said yes, I did.  So I was expelled a
nd then I went to I think the first boarding 
school I went to -- or the first boarding school  I went to was Switzerland, went to a very, 
very exclusive board ing school wh ere --
 
Q:  When  was that?
 
A:  At St. Gallen.  When?
 
Q:  When ?
 
A:  Well, that must have been, let's see, that
 must have been about 
'3 7, I'm pretty sure, 
and from _____+ and so on and so
 forth, and those were the kind, and my father was not 
that wealthy but there was somebody who liked 
me very much and fe
lt that I n eeded -- I 
deserved special consideration, so
 I think he paid part of the 
school.  So I went there for a 
year, but then I painted the walls and so  on, and 
so  they asked me to le
ave, so then I went 
to Bornheim.
 
Q:  What, you painted th e walls ___?
 
A:  Yeah, I just -- they were -- they were bl
ank walls, so I thought, well, I should bring a 
little color into the environment th
ere.  I was always very artistic
, even as a kid.  So well, 
my  father had to pay to clean the walls, repain
t them, and I left and I went to a school in 
Bornheim.  I think I wrote about my  school in
 Bornheim.  You want me to go into that?
 
Q:  Please.  
 
A:  The school was in the center of to
wn .  The school was -- where we slept was 
downtown and the school was a little out of 
town.  So where we slept, it was an old 
building, like the buildings here in Washingt
on, old stone building, three story.  The 
upper stories where the director and his fami ly
 lived and then the different floors were 
different rooms where the students lived.  I live
d with the son of a p
hysician.  He always 
had a little money. And the food was abso
lutely disgustingly 
terrible, and around 
Christmas time, upstairs, they were baki
ng.  And you can imag
ine the aroma going 
through the building, but the cookies were not
 made for us. So when
 I found a way, the 
director had gone I think to  an opera or some
thing like that.  So I found my way in and 
emptied the cookies and distributed  them thro
ughout the school, and I said, well, I better 

not be here when  he comes back
.  So I told my roommate, I 
said come on, let's go.  We 
were on th e third floor.  We put sheets togeth
er -- bed sheets, climbed out of the window, 
and then he said, I can 't go on.  Why?  I can't
 do it to my father, he
'll never forgive me.  
So we went in front of the 
door and waited for the director
 to come, and I took off. And 
then I didn't have -- I just a few marks, I didn'
t have enough to  take th
e train.  And I don't 
know, I have gypsy blood or something like th
at.  I went down to the -- to the river and 
was successful in convincing on
e of the captains to take me
 on the barge, you know the 
barges that go down , and th at was a very, very
 pleasant trip because the captain had his 
wife on th e barge with him, and I helped her 
to hang up or to hang her clothes that she 
washed, and you could see her bra and underw
ear and ev erything was flowing there with 
the wind, colorful thing. Well, that's how I arrived if Dusse
ldorf, and when I came to my 
mother, she already had a letter from the direct
or of the school.  W
hy do you do th at to 
us?  Why can't you be different?  
Your father, what is he going 
to  say?  You don't have to 
tell him.  Well, so I went back to the Dussel
dorg school, Ignazio, and I think I was in the 
Obertertia, that's when I beca
me involved in th
e Edelweisspiraten and found a lot of 
activities to  dampens my adventurism.
 
Q:  So what was your father's  re
action to, you know, that whole story?
 
A:  Well, he didn't know until he was told that I was arrested.
 
Q:  Oh, I see.
 
A:  And as a matter of fact, he was called from France to come.
 
Q:  When  you were in the Internacht (ph), 
were you still part of the Hitler Youth, did you 
still take part in Hitler Youth activities?
 
A:  Not if Switzerland of course there was a H itler Youth, and 
in Bornheim -- in 
Bornheim, yes, but there was not much Hitler Youth, no, no.
 
Q:  So by removing you fr
om Dusseldorf they separated you from the Hitler Youth?
 
A:  They  separated us what?
 
Q:  From the Hitler Youth.
 
A:  Yeah, and I don't really 
know why we at a
ny point in time have
 a Hitler Youth in 
Bornheim, and I'll have to think about it, real
ly, but we did not, but when  I came back to 
Dusseldorf, then of course I went back to 
Hitler Youth, and then my activities started 
with the Edelweisspiraten and that 
was a new adventure almo st every day.
 
Q:  Yeah, we heard you sp en
t considerable time on the Edelweisspiraten, but I want to 
sort of explore school a little bit more. 
 
So is there a teacher that you ha
d that you -- that you detested?
 

A:  That I had?
 
Q:  That you detested, that you hated?
 
A:  Oh, several I detested.  As a matter of 
fact there was one -- there was one who would 
ask you a question which had two answers, 
kind of.  If you an swered A, he would hit 
you; if you answered B, he 
would hit you, so you couldn't 
please him.  We called him a 
Nilpferd, a hippopotamu s because he had on
e wooden foot, so when  he came {making 
noises}, you could hear him come . And I told my
 father about it, and my father of course 
was absolutely sure that I de
served it, until one boy came to my home one day.  I think 

father was in the hospital, so he came and ha
d dinner with us, and my  father asked him, 
he said, oh, no, he hits anybody
, guilty or not guilty. 
 So my father look
ed at me -- he was 
a very radical man.  I'm very much like hi
m in many ways, and he said, he hits you 
without a reason, you hit him ba
ck, you hear, you hear. So the 
word  run thro ugh th e class, 
Walter's going to hit him.  Well, the next day he
 didn't hit me, and the next day he didn't 
hit me but then he hit me and I hit him back
.  I hit him back and I ran.  I ran to the 
principal's office.  I said I was crying, 
I hit the teacher, but he hit everybody ___+
 
My father had to come to school, and my fath
er raised hell.  The teacher was transferred 
to another place and so  that was one of the -- 
one of the big incident
s. Another thing, at 
that time, I became sexually very
 active at a very young age. 
 I found these elderly ladies 
who -- who took a liking to  me and taught me
, which was so much mo
re interesting than 
school, and, well, that's the way it went until 
January of 1943.  Of course by that time, 
Germany was bombed.  It was very mu ch the 
center of the war and fo od was hard to 
come by.  So in the evening I 
went to see my friends, the Fr
ench prisoners of war that I 
met with my friends.  We played  pool and we 
talked to -- about what to do next.  So we 
would hide their bicycles or 
-- see, there's a reflector on 
the fender of a bicycle on the 
back so that you see it when
 you drive behind them, and 
we would hang condoms on that 
thing and so things of that nature.  And we 
got away with little thi
ngs.  We want to do 
something better, maybe just take one wh eel out
 of the bicycle and l
eave the bicycle there 
with only one wheel or take 
the entire bicycle away
, things like that. 
 I always thought 
what are we going to do next, and we had 
a group and let's go maybe during the apple 

season, we would get togeth er on
 our bikes.  Of course we 
all had bikes.  I had a racing 
bike.  I would go to  next town  and put the 
bike against the tree, climb on th e bike and 
then collect apples.  Swimming in betw een -- well, until I was arrested and --
 
Q:  So, again, we'r e going to get to that in great detail.
 
A:  Yes.
 
Q:  I wanted to ask you, you 
said food was getting scarc e.  Ca
n you describe that a bit?  
What kind of things were available, what
 were you eating, ho
w did that all work?
 

A:  I don't know exactly wh en rationing starte
d, but I believe that 
by '43 we had rationing 
cards and the black market began.  My fath
er was born in the Eiffel region close to the 
Belgium border, I mean next door to the Be
lgian border, and so we
 always -- he went 
there and came back with butter and schmaltz
 and eggs, and so that
 when he went to 
France of course we always had coffee and so
 we did not suffer. Ration cards alone was I 
think 50 Klonfleisch, or Fleischnon, or anyt
hing th at's sausage or meat at 50 gramm per 
week and, very little in terms of
 fat, butter fat, whatever, that
 was rationed.  So  -- but the 
propaganda, in which the Germ
ans probably became the masters 
in the world, was so that 
people were happy to  sacrifice for the good of
 the country, so you didn't  hear too many 
people bitch or cried or complain.
 
Q:  My colleague, Ann Millen, said that wh
en you were in the exhibit, The State of 
Deception exhibit, that you kn
ew the KdF jingle.  Can you 
sing it or hum it for us now?
 
A:  Kraft durch Freu de {singing}. They  ar
e big things, Kraft durch Freude, you know, 
excursions, all that was done for the people to
 enjoy, to -- and if 
you didn't feel good, 
well, the the doctor prescribed 
einnakur (ph) which th ey didn't sell anywhere in  the wo rld 
but in Germany I think, so you were allowe
d to spend three weeks in the Schwarzwald 
because everything paid for and oh...
 
Q:  Did you ever go on vacation?
 
A:  Yes, I was -- when I went on vacation, 
I was very anxious to 
get to my father's 
hometown, because I loved to be
 with animals.  My great uncle -- oh, it's hard to believe, 
when I think about Germany 
so highly civilized and tremendous, advancement in 
industry and so on, well, th
e little town of Holoratz (
ph) in the Schneeeifel, my 
grandmother, my father's moth
er, like most girls in the to
wn, were sent down in the 
valley to wo rk as a ma id and possibly to fi
nd a husband.  So my  grandmother met my  
grandfather, and I think they went to the ha
ystack together and my  father became the 
result, and when the people realized that sh
e was -- that my  grandmother was pregnant, 
they threw stones at her until the priest of th
e town said may he who cast the first stone, 
you know. So then  up in that 
old build ing, wh ich was the ho
use in which my father was 
born was building 1640, and it still stands, so
 up -- wh at a very poor area, 1890, poor 
period, and out of straw they
 built a mattress and that's  wh
ere he was born, almost like 
Jesus Christ, and he loved it there. He was ve
ry happy, but to give you an  idea what 

things were like, I asked my  father one day,
 I said something that you remember that 
really had an impact on you?  Yep.  One 
day I was with a friend and we looked  up th e 
road, the 
K
uhstrasse it's called because the cows we
re driven up th ere to go to  pasture, 
and we saw the priest behind a tree peeing,
 and we looked at each other and we knew 
priests don't pee and we made it very clear 
they would not tell anybody because they 
would call us liars.  So the holy men don't pe
e. And so  in this little town you would see 
the blind obedience to the chur
ch , blind obedience to
 the Burg ermeister, and so on.  This 

obedience was reflected all ove
r Germany, whether it was the Kaiser or whether it was 
Hitler, it didn't make any difference.  So it wa
sn 't too difficult for somebody to take over 
and exploit this kind of sentiment, but I we
nt there because I didn't have to brush my  
teeth in the mo rning.  I didn't  have to wash
 up.  It was ideal. A
nd I tell you, you had to 
take care of cows, the neighbor's cows and se
veral cows got together and I had to take 
them together with the dog and a stick and I had to take them to a certain pasture, and the 

pastures had no fences, so I had to keep th
e cows from walking into
 the potato fields.  
Okay.  That was my job.  It was beautiful. 
 My great aunt would make a head of bread 
about this size.  I remember 
she would put it under her bosom and make a slice of it the 
size -- everything was hom
emade, homemade ham, homemade everything.
 
Q:  So about two feet, two and a half feet?
 
A:  Yep.  And sh e made ciders for me to 
take home.  Oh, it was so good, and I went 
there.  And I remember there wa
s a girl in the area also took 
care of some cows, that we 
became friends and we started -- 
spoke in Lorbeerblatt,
 whatever they are.  It's a shrub.
 
Q:  Laurel leaves?
 
A:  Huh?
 
Q:  Laurel leaves?
 
A:  Laurel leaf, yeah, yeah, that's right. 
 So  {making noise} oh, it was beautiful, so I 
loved to be in there.  I rea
lly loved to be there and I ha
ve been there many times even 
after the war.
 
Q:  Did you know your grandfather?
 
A:  Yes, I knew him.  Hated his guts.  He
 was a devout, stupid Ca
tholic, stupid in the 
sense he didn't ask questions.  He accepted 
and made it his own knowledge, but he was 
not very nice to my  mother, an
d he kind of respected me be
cause I didn't  agree with him 
and I open ly said so.  I was a tough kid, and he
 died of diabetes, I th
ink, and he wanted to  
see me.  I said I don't want
 to see him, so I didn't go.
 
Q:  What did he do fo r a living?
 
A:  Huh?
 
Q:  What did he do fo r a living, did he just run the farm?
 
A:  No, no, he was -- he was Mannesmann (p
h - correct), the famous German company, 
Mannesma nn.  Among other things they built
 seamless pipes and they had a plant in 
Helenta (ph), which was close to Holoratz (p
h) and he would manage
 the horses and take 
those pipes to the railroad station, and they  want
ed him to take over th
e horses into sort of 
in the main plant, so that's how we got to
 Dusseldorf. And then af
ter awhile, he was a 

rather ambitious -- was in the 
army and then  he joined  the police force, and he made a 
name for himself, because he apprehended one 
of the most ferocious criminals at the time 
who had chopped up children an d so.  It wa
s an atrocious thing.  And then he was 
extremely strong.  He looked 
a little bit like Khru
shchev, a stocky old 
bull, and he would 
accompany prisoners because they would get 
extra pay for that, 
and then he built a 
beautiful home. So he was very ambitious an
d became a lieutenant and was known as the 
Polizeimeier, and we walked -- I had this ch
ain here with a watch and walked , had no 
hair whatsoever.  I mean it was just like, lik
e bald head ed  old bull, and the kids saw him 
and said Polizeimeier, and they  would disappear
 with their soccer ba
lls and so on when 
he came.  B u t there he was.  His wife ha
d died rather young, and th en he had a 
housekeeper and I believe also his mistress.  
I don't know this, but I think so.  So I saw 
him rather infrequently.  I didn't like him.  
I liked my mother's fa
ther.  Yeah, he was a 
kind old man.
 
Q:  What did he do?
 
A:  He was a roofer, a roofer for only cathedr
als and churches, so I have a picture of him 
was high, high on th e upper part 
of the town church, you see,
 and then as SA come, he 
was a forest ranger for a noble man, so he went
 hunting and so on.  I used to see him with 
his long pipe, and he had the longest legs I ev
er seen, and he was able not only to put one 
leg under the other, he did one mo re curve a
nd he did that.  Opa, do it once -- one mo re 
time, and he did.  Oh , I got a kick out of th
at, and he was actually the first one I did a 
drawing of with my fountain 
pen, and my teacher didn't  believe that I had done it.
 
Q:  Which teacher was that?
 
A:  Huh?
 
Q:  Which teacher, do you remember?
 
A:  Yeah, but I don't remember his name, my
 art teacher.  I'd sa
y Johans, but I don't 
guarantee that that was right.  And wh en he rea
lized just I did it, then
 he took me to the 
Kunstakadmie for Dusseldorf, wh
ich is one of the best know
n Kunstakadmien in Europe.  
And there I was exposed to weird looking prof
essors with beards, I 
mean they look like 
hippies but hippies in the '40s, 
and my first thing was to nack
tzeichnen.  That me ans draw 
nudes.  Well, you know, at 11 or 
12 years old, to see a naked lady
 in front of you, it rather 
left an imp act on me and I don't know, I 
guess my pencil was a little shaking.  I 
remember when I used my si
ngle little bit of __ _____+  Ever
ything had to be done with 
a pencil. Well, that's w h ere I had my first art 
instruction.  I didn't last very long, I think 
three months or something like that.  There wa
s always something.  
Then -- then -- then 
my  parents had a friend who was an opera si
nger and I was a happy guy.  I always sang, 
and he heard my  voice I think in  the bathroom
 I was singing, and he said do you mind if I 
give a private lessons?  No.  And he was going
 to prepare me for th
e music co nservatory 

in Cologne.  I had to go there.  I had to sing 
Schubert's An die Mu sik {singing}.  Oh, very 
difficult song.  And they thought I was not quite
 good enough as a so loist, so I thought 
that I would be all right in the choir, and I 
didn't think that I -- I think I was too good fo r 
the choir, so I didn't stay ther
e. So  I had many in terests.  I had a problem that I was born 
with quite a few talents, none of them deve
loped to the extreme, but I knew this and I 
knew this and I knew this
 and I knew a little o f everything. 
 I learned languages just like 
that.  So I had a problem I want to be a movi
e star.  I wanted to be
 locomotive driver.  I 
wanted to  be, you name it, so anyway.  Mo re questions, please.
 
Q:  So what happened that you had to 
leave the Kunstakademi, do you rememb er?
 
A:  When ?
 
Q:  No.  Wh at happened?  Why did you leav
e the Kunstakademie?  You said something 
happened .
 
A:  Oh, just because.  That wa s not -- that was -that was a volunteer thing.  I went there in 
addition to school.  Okay.  So I just didn't li
ke it.  So I don't want to go back, and since 
my father was not at home, there was nob
ody who could handle me.  See, my  mo m -- 
father handled me brutally, and my  mo ther
 tried love but she was not quite strong 
enough, poor little woman, so...
 
Q:  I think now would be 
a good time for a break, so...
 
A:  All right.
 
Q:  This is a continuation of the United St
ates Holocaust Memorial Museum Interview 
with Walter Meyer. So Herr Meyer, you said over 
the break you had fun in the Junkvolk.  
Could you explain, please?
 
A:  Yeah.  The Jungvolk was very much lik
e the Boy Scouts, little camping trips, and it 
would please me enormously that I became a 
drummer, and so I could show off with my  
drum and get a little attention that way, whic
h I needed  badly, and even my  mo ther said 
would you show me again, dr
um a little bit.  So I drumme
d and I sang.  I was a happy 
little fellow.  So the Jungvolk 
was, I would have to admit that it was a pleasure for a 
young boy to join th e Jungvolk, 
and I repeat, it was just as enj
oyable as it is my  son to be 
part of the Boy Scouts.
 
Q:   You had an opportunity 
to go to the Adolf Hitler Schul
e.  What is an Adolf Hitler 
Schule.  What does that entail?
 
A:  Adolf Hitler Schule was a select -- I thi
nk there were two, maybe three out of Hitler 
school in Germany, and they were there to
 train, indoctrinate young men to become 
leaders, let 's say, with some exaggeration,
 like the LBJ School of Public Affairs in 
Austin, Texas who will train pe
ople to become excellent in government administration.  

This was a little similar, but only one sided, 
in other word s, all under the umbrella of 
national socialism.  And to  enter there, you 
had to go through -- y
ou would have to be 
highly recommended and 
you had to go through a presc
hool, thro ugh a screening process 
and so on.  So I think my fath
er didn't quite know wh at was in
volved, so I went to the, to 
the first essetapa 
canâ„¢t identify word
 (ph), the first step of a screening school, passed that, 
and then my father got a letter which he ha
d to sign and he refuse
d to sign because he 
thought that was a little 
too mu ch for a young man and he just did not agree.  So he didn't 
sign, so I didn't go.  So the Hitler school 
was maybe the equivale
nt, if you want to 
comp are to going to  a Jesuit schoo
l to become a priest, okay.  It would be totally a one-
sided education.
 
Q:  I mean were you upset that you couldn't  go?
 
A:  Why my father didn't like it?
 
Q:  Were you upset that you couldn't go?
 
A:  Yes, I believe I was a little upset, but I do
n't think I took it too seriously.  Yes, I was 
upset, but I was used to my father saying 
no to something that I wanted badly so...
 
Q:  Did you experience any schooling in th
e Hitler Youth, any schooling in the Hitler 
Youth?
 
A:  Not schooling per se.  You 
had of course theoretical instru
ctions in the branch.  Let's 
say the Navy.  You would learn 
about how ships operate, the 
size of ships and wh at you 
do in  the Navy.  So  the theoretical part you 
would learn, and how to
 speak with flags and 
the different ranks, history of 
the navy, yes, but mo st of it was the practical aspect of it.
 
Q:  Can you explain?
 
A:  Yes.  You would learn how to -- how to
 use breathing apparatus underwater.  You 
would learn to connect magnetic bombs underw
ater and you would train to bomb  ships 
underwater, ships that would be anchored in  a port and --
 
Q:  How did you react to that 
training, did you like it, hate it?
 
A:  Yeah, it was interesting.  It was advent
urous, because you would swim with clothes 
on.  You would swim with clothes and shoes 
on.  I mean there were
 scenarios where you 
would th ink that you under pr
essure and you have a gun w
ith you and how can you swim 
with all this weight and so on.  So it was 
an interesting scenario
, yes, and besides you 
would -- you would be treated as somewhat of
 a special guy.  You were a prince.  You 

were a little champion, you know.
 
Q:  Explain.
 
A:  Well, you were not just any ordi
nary  guy, you were a super athlete.
 

Q:  Explain -- explain how that worked 
in the Hitler Youth, being an athlete?
 
A:  Well, were you treated with a little more 
respect like -- than an
 ordinary guy and...
 
Q:  Now, you were talking about competition 
in the Hitler Youth. 
 Can you explain how 
that works?
 
A:  Yes.  Before the Hitler Youth existed,
 swimmers or athletes in general would 
represent a club, let us say that I would sw im for the swim club of Washington and we 
would have a big swim meet going on in 
Washington sponsored by the federation -- 
swimming federation and invite clubs from Ph
iladelphia, from all around they would 
come and swim here. Well, the Hitler Y
outh took over, so now I would swim 
representing the Hitler Youth, Section 6 
of Dusseldorf, swimming against the Hitler 
Youth, Section 9 of Fr
ankfurt, and there whether differe
nt cities represented different 
sections of the Hitler Youth.  So to find 
out who was the best swimmer in the Hitler 
Youth, okay, and it culminated 
in the Reichsjugendmeisterschaft,  th at means th e youth 
championship in sw imming.
 
Q:  And you participated in that?
 
A:  Yes, twice.
 
Q:  How did you do?
 
A:  I was third once and fourth once, so I was --
 
Q:  So pretty high up?
 
A:  Well, pretty high up.  I was -- I was a
ll right but I was not on top, and really I 
participated in the German championship, th
e open championship  and I was third and that 
was pretty good, but you had to  consid er that 
some of the best swimmers were already in 
the Navy, so they di
dn't participate.  So my 
competition was rather limited.
 
Q:  Can you sum up your experience in the 
Hitler Youth but as a favor or a colleague, can 
you say it in Sp anish?
 
A:  {Speaking Spanish} 58:30.

Q:  Thank you.  Let's turn to the edelweiss 
pirates.  Can you tell me
 about them, how they 
were formed, how that worked.
 
A:  The ed elweiss pirates -- well, edelweiss is
 the flower that only grows up in th e high 
mountains of the Alps.  It's a pretty flower
 and it represents bravery, strength.  My 
brother tried to pick  edelweiss for his mo th
er and fell to his death and th ey fo und him 
with edelweiss in his hands, so edelweiss in 
my family was something very special.  A 
group in Berlin started the Edelweissp
riaten, how did you hear about them?
 
A:  News got around they 
were persecuted, as you w
ould hear about saboteur and 
committed sabotage and so on, an
d that triggered an interest
 in we could do something 
like that.  And there was enough hatred, disres
pect for our leaders, 
and I'm talking ab out 
our immediate leaders, that 
means companions who now becam
e lieutenants and captains 
and we had to respect and salute them and 
listen to them and obey them, and that was 
definitely against my nature. And I found 
quite a few comrades who, for adventurous 
reasons, for one reason or the other sided with 
me and said yeah , let's have some fun.  So  
I have to emphasize that I was a little too yo
ung, even though after the war, we were 
considered political prisoners, but really, th
ere was no real ideological reason because I 
didn't  understand national socialism as I woul
d understand it today.  It was mo re of a 
movement based upon rebellious nature, protes
t against blind obedie
nce, this sort of 
thing.  So we formed a ch
apter in Dusseldorf and hoped 
that eventually we would 
establish contact with the Edelweisspiraten in
 Berlin, but we did not.  So then  we spent 

quite a bit of time thinking of what we coul
d do to make their, in quote, their life more 
difficult.
 
Q: Who is the their?
 
A:  Well, our leaders, the ones we hated,
 our captains and lieutenants and captains.
 
Q:  In the Hitler Youth then?
 
A:  Yeah, yes, yes.
 
Q:  So how many of them were you?
 
A:  Oh, we were about 12.
 
Q:  So 12.  Your group was 12, and you then, 
as a group, decided we can do th is or that 
against the Hitler Youth?
 
A:  Correct.
 
Q:  So what are some 
of the -- some of the things that you th ought up?
 
A:  Ha, well, I told you before we would 
-- all the reflectors on the bicycles, on their 
bicycle, we could hang condom
s there, and especially we 
would put them there in the 

dark so th ey would not discover them right away
 and take them off.  They would ride the 
bike and then somebody starte
d laughing because they drov
e behind th em.  So we'd  do 
that.  Steal the bike.  Deflate the tires, we 
would do th at rather fre
quently, paint things on 
their -- put poo poo on the bike, wh atever.
 
Q:  Did you have other fun,
 did you do other things?
 
A:  We would generally meet in what was ca
lled in Dusseldorf Cafe Meintz (ph).  They 
had in the back, they had billia
rd room, so we'd  play pool
.  That's where we had our 
meetings.  What are we going 
to do next, and so fun, as I 
said I became interested in 
women, had an affair with our mail woman a
nd looked for adventure of any sort, but in 
this particular framework, it was generally th
inking about how can 
we make those stupid 
idiots' life a little more difficult.
 
Q:  So does that mean you dr
opped out of the Hitler Youth?
 
A:  Dropped out?  That would have been 
impossible because it was oblig atory to  join.  
You had to have a qualified reason, like maybe
 losing one leg or something like that, that 
you couldn't do it, but as long as
 you were healthy 
and you didn't have Jewish blood for 
five generations, then
 you had to join.
 
Q:  So how did that work, being a part of 
the Hitler Youth and rebelling against them at 
the same time?  How did it work being part
 of the Hitler Youth and rebelling against 
them at the same time?
 
A:  Ha.  Well of course we tried to be as 
clandestine as possible, so on th e surface, we 
were just very loyal members of the H itler Youth and our movement was rather 
underground.  Okay.  So it was so it was wh
at in Germany you call Schikane, based upon 
our dislike for authority.
 
Q:  How did your parents react to this?  
Did they ev en know wh at you were doing?
 
A:  They  didn't know.  They  didn't.  My fa
ther was in France so there was only my  
mo ther.  I was the only one left.  My brother ha
d died.  He died in  '41.  And so I was the 
only one left and she never knew what I was 
and sometimes I didn't  come home at night, 
and the poor woman.  Why are you -- I didn't
 know, I just -- I should have been  born in 
west Texas on a big ranch.
 
Q:  Do you remember th
eir names, your friends in the edelweiss pirates?
 
A:  Oh, there was -- yeah, there 
was Eddie Violent (ph) was one.
 
Q:  Was he a good friend, Eddie Violent?
 
A:  Yes, he still is.  He's dying, but I talk 
to him once in awhile.  He's  still hanging in 
there.
 

Q:  How did you meet him?
 
A:  He was a neighbor.
 
Q:  And how did you --
 
A:  He's the one, Eddie, who took over -- wh
o took over the Jewi
sh bar.  When I was 
arrested, Eddie knew him, so he went over a
nd stayed -- for the rest 
of the war, he stayed 
with Eddie.
 
Q:  So explain that.  How did th at happen
?  You're in the edelweiss pirates an d you 
decide you're going to
 hide a Jewish boy?
 
A:  Maybe -- maybe -- I don 't know, maybe I 
should think a little mo
re about what I did 
and how I did it, but maybe one of the things 
was that we did not enjoy the procedure of 
the Hitler Youth being helpful in the prosec
ution of Jews, which 
they were, and I had 
these friends, they didn't do any harm to anybody.
  They were nice kids and so on, and so 
we were very much interested in helping 
the underdog.  So we 
considered the Jews 
underdogs. And so this one guy, wh en we kn
ew they were being ev
acuated and sent to 
places, well, we didn't want him to go.  I di
dn't know his parents, and so  I just thought 
one day if you don'
t want to go, you can stay with me. 
 And so he stayed
 with me for, oh, 
I don't know, I would say probably  six months
 or eight months.  And it was not broadcast 
in my family that he's  a Jew.  It was just
 he's a young man who needs a little help and can 
he stay with us?  Yeah, he can sleep in 
my  brother's bed, you see. And so  in the 
apartment housing which we lived in, there were
 a total of six parties, ____+ .  So they  
didn't  know that he was a Jewish boy.  It wa
s not broadcast.  He was just a friend.  And 
so when I was arrested, then 
-- I believe that when I had a 
visit with -- from my  mother, 
the question came out of wh at are we going to 
do with Hans Dieter (ph)?   I said call 
Eddie Violent he's going to  take care of him. 
 So he took over.  That was just one block 
from our house, and his situation was a little ni
cer because he lived a house.  The house 

was his.  Okay.  So he had a little more free
dom and who walked in his house.  Okay.  
And he stayed with him for th
e rest of the war.  What happened with him afterwards, I do 
not know, and I asked Eddie and he didn't know 
-- oh, yeah.  He told me one day, he said 
guess wh at?  You you reme mb er
 Hans?  Yeah.  He died.
 
Q:  What was his name , Hans?
 
A:  Hans Dieter Von Schwejk (p h).
 
Q:  Von Schwejk?
 
A:  But I don't know whether the parents en
ded up mo st likely in the concentration camp 
somewhere.  I don't know details.  I don't know 
wh at happened  to him 
after the war, so...
 

Q:  So your -- your friend, I mean he was in 
the edelweiss pirates with you.  Did he have 
scathingly brilliant ideas?
 
A:  Eddie, yeah, Eddie is extremely, extrem
ely talented with his hands.  He can build 
anything.  I have to ship a stove.  He built a st
ainless stove for me.  I have to ship it, it's 
too damn heavy, but I have to sh ip it to the 
States sometime.  So 
he would help us many 
if we want to break in somewhere,
 he would give us
 the key or the 
Dietrich
 it's called in 
Germany. It's kind of thing that
 fits any lock.  So he would 
do things like that, and yeah, 
anything mechanical and so  on, he would help
.  That was mostly his work.  He was not a 
very athletic type.  He was more the thinker and the doer.
 
Q:  Was there anything else that you di
d because it was against policy of the Nazis?
 
A:  I think what was mo re than anything 
was that you could not argue.  You could not 
discuss.  You had to accept what
ever was said as the final truth, and I liked the idea of 
asking why and how and y
ou couldn't.  So that was a litt
le against my nature of just 
accepting things blindly.
 
Q:  So where did you get non-government 
information from?  Where did you get that 
information?
 
A:  From radio, BBC, from some foreign ma
gazine.  My father bought some home once 
in awhile, books.
 
Q:  Tell me about the POWs.
 
A:  The POW?  Well, my father was a linguist,
 and as a little boy, he would see to it that I 
spoke French.  So he would tell 
me in  Fren ch , g et me my  sli
ppers or good evening.  And 
so I know my father or I knew 
my father only as pere, which 
is father in French.  I never 
called him 
Papi
 or father, it's always pere.  A
nd so  not too far from my home was a 
factory -- paper machine factory, and in th
e basement of the factory were French  
prisoners of war.  And understand that there 
were quite a few factor
ies where they put the 
prisoners in the botto m and made the enem
y -- somehow made the enemy know that 
there were prisoners so they
 wouldn't bomb the fa
ctory and kill their 
own people. And so  
the lower windows had these had these iron ba
rs, and through them I could see them and 
there was enough to shake hands or to give 
them something, so I went there once and 
practiced French.  Bonsoir, me
s amis.  Comment Ã§a va?  A
nd so  -- Qu'est-ce que vous 
avez besoin?  What do you need
.  I remember one gave me 
a little piece of wood and he 
had written down, when will the 
French prisoners of war be 
liberated?  And I thought oh, 
God, I have no an swer for this.  I don't know. 
 I felt a little bad that I didn't  have an 
answer, but I brought them thi
ngs to eat.  I didn't have mu
ch, but I brought them a little 
bread or th ings. And then they gave me letters
 to send, and wh en my
 father came to town 
-- that was one thing about my  dad.  He was 
very mu ch  in favor of helping the underdog, 

and you should see the testimony
 he got from French men after the war.  It was very 
beautiful.  And he became an immediate ch
ief interpreter of the French military 
government because -- so anyway, I gave th
em the letters and he would see that the 
letters would go to their destination in Fran
ce and I would get answers back, and so I was 
the middle man kind of. And yeah, I was -- I we
nt there at least thre
e times -- three times 
a week and somehow -- you know, in Germ
any, neighbors know what you're doing.  I 
mean you cannot do anything without somebo
dy knowing.  Spitzel.  They watch over 
you.  So somehow my activities w ith the Fr
ench prisoners of war became known, not to 
the point where they prosecuted
 me immediately or looked 
fo r me, but it became known.  
So that is what the judge br
ought up, and you know, from th
e police when I was arrested 
and went to the police pres -- 
first throughpolizei revier Po
lizeirevier, and then to the 
polizei presidio PolizeiprÃ¤sidiu
m and then the Gestapo until ev
entually I went to prison, 
but then  things came up.  You like French, hu
h?  That's h o w it started.  So I don't 
reme mb er your last question.
 
Q:  Well, I just asked you about the PO
Ws, wh at your relationship with them --
 
A:  Yeah, oh, yeah.  The POWs
.  So those -- those -- that's my POWs.  That's why I tried 
to help th em with a little food here and ther
e and take their letter
s and bring them mail 
from their families, an d so they were happy to  see me an d I was happy to practice a little 
French with them.
 
Q:  Did you experience the 
bombing of DÃ¼ sseldorf at all?
 
A:  Oh, yeah.
 
Q:  Can you explain how th at 
worked, what that process was?
 
A:  Well, of course the siren, when it starte
d, went {makingnoise}
 and then when it was 
over it wo uld go {making noise}., monotone.  
Well, when it started, everybody would 
run as fast as possible into the basement or
 to the bunker.  There were bunkers all over 
town , and then would you hear 
the bombs falling.  DÃ¼ sseldorf was destroyed 75 percent.  
So yeah, and in '43, it became
 a nightly affair.  DÃ¼sseldorf or the vicinity was bombed.  
It's a very industrial city a
nd very close to the rural region 
where all the steel industry of 
Germany is so...
 
Q:  So I mean were you person
ally affected by the bombing?
 
A:  By affected, you would wake up in  the 
mo rning, an d these houses over there didn't 
exist anymore, they were ruins and you would 
have to go a long way around to get where 
you wanted to go and things like that.  And 
you heard that such an
d such family, they 
were killed during the bombardment.  And I he
ard once this guy, believe it or not, he 
survived  with his bed.  He e
nded up in the other house across 
the street.  Things like that.  

And so, yeah, that's h o w I was affected, 
and we lived south of town, which was a 
residential area whichwa
s not heavily bomb ed .
 
Q:  Did you hear about VolksschÃ¤dlin
ge, public enemies, VolksschÃ¤dlinge,?
 
A:  Volk sschÃ¤dlinge, oh yeah , the 
Volk s Schadlinge Vo lksschÃ¤dlinge.
 
Q:  Public enemies? 
 
A:  Of course in DÃ¼sseldorf and every major 
square you had several 
things.  Once a week 
you had the farmers -- the farm
er's market there, and then
 generally you had restrooms 
underneath, and then you ha
d the StÃ¼rmer, and loudspeakers.  When Hitler spoke of 
course, he would sit there and 
listen to the loudspeakers, and 
the StÃ¼rmer of course would 
bring out the newest in -- in what the Jews di
d, what they had done
, what they did, how 
they behaved, how terrible they were and so  on 
and so forth.  Cartoons of Jews, picture of 
Jews, the Jewish barber accused of raping
 a customer and so  on and so forth.
 
Q:  I mean would y
ou see people standing 
there reading them?
 
A:  Oh, yeah, sure.  You would 
stand th ere.  It was up there. 
 It was like a showcase with 
the newspaper filled the entire, you know, the pa
ge of a newspaper, filled the entire case.  
As a matter of fact, you have one in the -- in
 the -- in the holocaust 
museum.  Yeah, it's a 
replica.  It's  perfect.  That's 
-- that's it.  Yeah, people wo
uld stand there, yeah, and read 
and they  would read in front of the newspa
per building.  They  put out not only StÃ¼rmer, 
but they  put out the daily newspaper.  So pe
ople stood th ere in line, but yeah , StÃ¼rmer, 
yeah, it was always something new, yeah.
 
Q:  Did you hear about people 
taking property after a bomb ing?
 
A:  Well, taking property was somethi
ng th at happened  not 
infrequently.  After 
Kristallnacht, it was a common th
ing, and of course -- of c
ourse after the Jews had no 
recourse.  It was nothing th ey co uld do, wh ethe
r they liked it or not.  And I often wo nder 
if the guy had not killed ___, 
what would have happened.  
Something else would have 
happened , I'm pretty sure but...so, so StÃ¼r
mer, yeah, sure, people stood th ere.  Some 

laughed because some  of the cartoons were
 funny with th e big noses and so on.
 
Q:  Do you remember th
e day you were arrested?
 
A:  Oh, yeah.
 
Q:  So tell me about that day.  What was going on?
 
A:  A friend of mine and I walk ed out of th e 
pool room after we heard the siren.  It was 
after an attack, a bomb attack. 
 We walked outside and this is on the Kings Avenue.  It's 
like Fifth Av enue.  It's one of 
the well-known streets in the wo
rld, ____ in Berlin ___ in 
DÃ¼sseldorf, fancy stores, expensive stores.  It
's a very fashion city, DÃ¼sseldorf, and wide 

avenues beautiful trees, parks and so on. Anyw
ay , we walked out, a
nd right next to the 
Cafe Meintz (ph) was a shoe store, and the shoe
s were just all over the place, so we didn't  
have to get into the store to 
get them.  We picked them up 
on the street, and -- but it was 
dark.  So it was cold.  It was January, and I just
 stuffed a bunch of, I th
ink five or six.  I 
stuffed them in here and said let's go, and we 
went to the -- believe it or not, we went out 
to Adolf Hitler Platz. The lights went on and pe
ople came out of the bunker, and I looked  
at the shoes and I realized they were all left
ies, and I thought golly.  Well, an old lady 
came -- an elderly lady came.  I said, woul
d you like some shoes?
  Here, why don't I 
make you happy.  I have my  shoes.  Oh, come
 on.  I tried to persuade her, and I didn't see 
the policeman that was there.  Hey, what do 
you have th ere?  And I said nothing.  Let me 
see.  And I started running, and he whistled, 
and I think I made thr
ee blocks or something 
and there was a guy a big bear of a guy like y
ou, and he opened his ar
ms.  He gave me a 
bear hug. Yep, and so  I was taken to the 
polizei revier Polizeirevier, and from there I 
went to the polizei presidio
 Po lizeiprasidium, headquarters.  And then  questions, 
questions, questions, and 
th en because they felt that I was 
-- I think they felt that I should 
be interviewed by th e Gestapo.  So  I went 
to the I think {?Prinzg
elstrasse?}  where the 
Gestapo was, and I had to undress and then  ex
amined me and they  didn't -- oh, I have to 
mak e so me th ing  clear so  it mak es  mo re sen se .
 I was born almo st circumcised, which does 
happen.  Instead of having the long fo reskin 
-- I mean the head of the penis was sticking 
out a little bit.  So when I started to mastur
bate and have fun sexu
ally, it hurt, and so  I 
told my father.  He took me to the doctor, and I remember he 
said, I give you one mark if 
you don't scream.  So I had to pull the skin ba
ck as far as it go, and he came with a long 

needle and {making noise}, and I got one 
mark. So but when th
e Rassenexperte (ph), 
___+ he looked at me and said 
this is a Juden, and so they
 argued and looked at me and 
then they called someb
ody who was really a specialist a
nd he looked at me and no, no, 
no, no.  No , he's not Jewish at all, but I almo
st -- I almost became a 
Jew there for awhile.  
So from the Gestapo I was sent to prison, and 
then and then I went to court on April the 

12th and from then it went on.
 
Q:  So what went through yo
ur head when you were arrest
ed, what were you thinking?
 
A:  Through my  head ?
 
Q:  Uh-h uh.
 
A:  Oh, I was sure that at one point I would 
be released.  If you had told me you're going 
to be locked up fo
r the next two years.
 
End of File One
 
Beginning File Two
 

Q:  This is a United States Holocaust Me
morial Museum interview with Walter Meyer, 
conducted by William Meinke on 
May 20th in the U.S. Holo
caust Memorial Museum in 
Washington D.C.  This is part tw o of an 
in terview that began yesterday, May 19th. So  
Herr Meyer, I'd like you -- yesterday, we finished 
with your arrest.  Is there anything else 
you want to say about your arrest?
 
A:  Well, I think -- I think we fi
nished yesterday with a bear hug.
 
Q:  Yes.
 
A:  Right.  So I couldn't run any longer.  
I had to surrender, and shortly thereafter, the 
policeman who wanted to arrest me in the fi
rst place, he caught up, took me and to ok me 
to the police station, and --
 
Q:  Did he say anything to you?
 
A:  Yeah, he was very angry to me, as a matter 
of fact, he got behind me an orfieger (ph), 
and they're going to teach you how to treat 
a G erman police office
r, and soon, these 
words, and, oh, maybe an hour later, I was ta
k en to the Polizeiprasidium, which would be 
equal to a police headquarters, and there they
 tried to get the docum
ents together since 
mine is a rather comm on name where my  parents 
live, the address, birth date, et cetera, et 
cetera, and when  all that was done and I was 
asked wh at I had done and I play ed  kind of 
innocent, I haven't done anything.  Well, we 
will find out about you if you don't want to 
talk.  So I was at the Polizeiprasidium and th
at's where interrogation continued, or let's 
say it started all over again, the same questions
, and I gave the same  answers, but then I 
realized they knew more than
 I knew about me, and when th
at verhÃ¶r, that interrogation 
ended, I was taken to the Gest
apo headquarters, and they th
en forgot the matter of the 
shoes very mu ch.  That was not even mentioned.
  They  kind of want
ed to hear
 about the 
Edelweisspiraten, my contact 
with French  prisoners of war and my memb ership in the 
Hitler Youth and why I had done th
at, and one of them seemed 
to be a little -- what's the 
word  I'm looking fo r?  He didn't quite trust me
.  So I was asked to undress, and then they  

looked at my genitals -- genita
ls and one says, It's a Juden. Th
is is a Jew.  No, no.  Yes, 
yes.  Well, then they calle
d some one who was mo re of an
 expert, and he didn't quite 
know what to do with
 me, and then they go
t a super experts, ehnrasseenkundig e (ph), and 
he looked at me and he realized that that no,
 I was not really circumcised, it was only half 
circumcision or something like that, and so I 
was able to get dressed again and one told  

me boy, you're lucky you got away with it. 
 You're lucky you're not Jewish.  And I got 
dressed again, and th en all th
is took an hour, two hours.  
I don't know.  And then  I was 
driven  to the prison, and the prison I was gi
ven prison clothing and I was taken to my  
cell, which was going to  be my  
home for I guess about a month.
 
Q:  Was that a youth facility or was that --
 

A:  Oh, no, it was --
 
Q:  An adult prison.  
 
A:  It was a regular prison, yeah , and I 
drove by th ere ma ny times when I went to 
workout at the swim club.  We
 drove by the prison many times.  We made jokes.  We call 
it the -- the -- it had a special name.  We ca
lled coffee so-and-so, cafe so-and-so, and of 
course at that time I never dreamed that I woul
d become an occupant of it. Well, I was in 

one cell.  It was a small cell, with one wind
ow, and with a little effo rt I could look out of 
the window, at least a little part of it, and I 
saw a courtyard, and my neighbor next door, a 
young man, he yelled all day long, by all day 
lo ng, liebataten dieant (ph), and God, it was 
horrible to listen, until his voice got really hors
e, liebataten (ph), and I heard that later on 
he ate his own feces and was taken to a state h o
spital. So well, in the 
morning, we were to 
take our kÃ¼bel, we called it, 
it was a container out of ceramic
 container, big container and 

we had to  take this one behind the other an d go to the main section where we emptied it 

and rinsed  it and then  took it back, and in th
e meantime there, we were able to sit down a 
row of people and do our busin
ess, went back to the cell. And I think maybe the third or 
fourth  day, I was asked to join a group, and 
we were supposed to sew buttons on tents for 
soldiers.  We did that.  Then I did another 
job with something like weeding. And then I 
have to emphasize this over and over again, that I tried every -- I mean I dreamed of 

escaping, and so  I figured that if I don't ea
t fo r awhile I'm going 
to faint probably and 
they'd  take me to a hospital a
nd then from the hospital I can eas
ily escape.  So I didn't  eat 
for ten days, and yeah , I kind of fainted, but 
instead of taken to the hospital, they whipped 
my butt, because they r
ealized I did this not as an accident but purposely.  So th at didn't 
work. Well, I was in that prison until April th
e 12th when I was take
n to the court, and 
that's where I saw -- after awhile I saw my 
parents for the first time.  My father, my 
mo ther was there.  They  looked very stern.
  My mo ther was crying and my  father had 
engaged the services of two attorneys that 
didn't do anything.  I assumed the attorney s 
didn't  really have mu ch power.  They had to
 say yes and no, and be very obedient to the 
judge who was the mo st powerfu
l autocrat. And so  then th
e ceremo ny began.  Walter 
Meyer, stand up.  You're Walter Meyer.  Yeah. 
 You're accused of plunder.  That was the 

prosecuting attorney talking, and I don'
t know whether you're
 aware, but this 
automatically called for the death penalty, and 
one of the attorneys 
jumped and held my 
arm, and said that's not the last word. And,
 well, they narrated, esplundern  aktivitaten the 
Edelweisspiraten forbid den 
know mitsa creeks fangen and so  on.(ph) And th en they 
rested their case, and then 
they ex cu sed themselves and went to have I assume a 
conference of some sort.  And th ey came back
, the judge then made 
it clear, said I cannot 
call this plundern .  The mo st I can call it einf
acher Diebstahl, simp le theft, and I have 
even questions about that, but this young 
man needs a strong remedy.  He obviously 
doesn 't quite fit into into wh
at our country needs and contac
t with the enemy destroying 
state property, all this.  However, I have ta
ke in to consideration that he was an 

outstanding athlete.  I also consider that that
 he lost one brother and -- but I feel that I 
sh ou ld  g i v e h i m a min i mu m o r  ma x i mu m p e na
lty, which means that 
after one year of 
good conduct, he can join th
e armed forces, so he's  got a chance.  It all depends upon 
him.  So it's one to four years.  If he doesn'
t have good behavior then he has to  stay for 
three years.  Do you understand that?  Yes, 
I understand. Okay .  That was the end of the 
case.  Then I was taken -- went back to the pr ison.  Maybe three, four, five days later I 

was called, get dressed and I was taken to th
e railroad station, and from there, I went 
what is called a German auft transport. (ph)  
I went first to Cologne, stayed at the Klinger 
Priz prison, (ph) which was rather interesti
ng because we were in cells that had to be 

vacated every so often, because from there 
you could look down at the courty ard where 
they would chop head s, okay and 
we were not supposed to see 
that.  Well, we heard this -
- the stotten clerk (ph) bim, bim, bim, bim.
{ m aking noises}  So we
 had to move to the 
other side, and when  the storm was over we went
 back , but that prison was so full of bugs 
-- red bugs.  Oh, it was disgustingly dirty.  
But I was there maybe two days, three days.  
From there, I went to Coblen z.  Coblenz to Fr
ankfurt.  Frankfurt then  by bus to Butzbach , 
and from there we walked, that means a polic
eman and I.  Policeman looked at me and 
said, look, let's not have any problems.  Walk
 nicely next to me and we won't have any 
problem.  Don't try to escape. 
 Don't make my life difficult, 
okay.  So he delivered to me 
to the Ro ckenberg  youth prison.
 
Q:  Before one more, Walte
r, do you think you can talk 
about the trial in Spanish?
 
A:  Yes, of course.
 
Q:  So do you want to start?
 
A:  {speaking Spanish}
 (17:00) entre la corte...la puesa
 prosecutor y pr
osecutor lista 
comitido aver abrogado contacto con prisionero
s de guerra frances que nuestros amigos 
juventud hitleristo destruyo
 propiedad del Esta
do equal termino entonces...palabra... I 
went back  to the prison.
 
Q:  So you arrived in the y
outh detention center, the jugends
trafanstalt in Buchenberg.  
So what did you see there, wh
at did you -- what met you th ere?
 
A:  What did I see in the jugendstrafanstalt?
 
Q:  When  you arrived, how did that work?
 
A:  Well, first, I was impressed by -- sou
nds a little funny in pr
ison setting, sounded 
beautiful, but this was a beautiful setup becau
se it was not a prison per se, but it used to 
be a convent or cloister and the area was rath
er, rather attractive, and well, like in every 
prison, first you surrender the clothes you 
have, and th ey  give 
you a prison uniform.  
They  gave me a cell, which would be my  ho
me for awhile, and we had lessons there of 
geography and so on and so  forth, I mean
, not very considerable but maybe -- maybe 

twice a week or maybe only once a week.  I 
don't reme mber too well.
 And my  neighbor -
- my neighbor in the cell there after, he was ki nd of a, like later in the concentration, in 
the capo, he was a privileged prisoners, his ce
ll door was always open.  He could walk in 
and out when he want 
to, and I found out that he had 
killed his father.  But see killing 
your father was not as bad as helping Fr
en ch prisoners of wa
r, something like that. 
Anyway in my cell, an d then 
a week, two weeks later, th en th
ey found out that I hid -- I 
had mo re education than the rest of the prison
ers.  They were more of the lower echelon 
of society, so it was an elderly police 
employee who was the buyer.  He would buy 
vegetables and things that the kitchen of theprison need, and they  needed an assistant and 

he picked  me.  And as such of course I c
ould have survived forever there and I would 
have gained  quite a bit of weight because the 
food was at my  disposal, and so I did that 
for awhile until I had the problem
 with my attempt to escape. 
Do you want me to go into 
that?
 
Q:  Please.
 
A:  Well, I was supposed to take control over
 certain things.  That means I had -- I did a 
little bureaucracy, what we bought and so  on, an
d nicely organized, and I was in the part 
of the prison that was the cloister at one
 time, very thick wa
lls, but I found a little 
window where the bars, one bar was loose. 
 I could take it out.  I assume -- it w as a 
convent, and so it was wear and tear over the y
ears and years and years.  So I figured  that 

would be my chance to escape.  And I wrote 
a little note to my father, whom I expected 
to visit, and a little map where he would have
 to expect me and so on.  I mean it was 
nicely detailed, small letters.  I folded that
, put it in my  pocket, and somehow, I don't 
know how, but I lost the little piece of pape
r and it was found and I 
was called before the 
warden.
 
Q:  What made you th ink y
our father would help you?
 
A:  I would climb out and he
 would be waiting with a car.
 
Q:  Well, what made you th ink that your father
 would agree to that, that he wo uld help?  
Did you believe your 
father would help?
 
A:  Yeah.
 
Q:  No question?
 
A:  No question.  No question.  Oh , yes. 
 And of course it was ideal because it was in 
France, so I would have disappeared in Fran
ce, would have been id eal solution, but it 
didn't  work that way.  And so
 no more visits from 
then on.  I went in the dungeon for 28 
days and --
 
Q:  What's the dungeon?
 

A:  Well, the solitary cell for 28 days, swalik en
 bot en vasel (ph).  
So that was my first 
severe penalty, and after that I had two mo re lik
e that.  So I became 
an ordinary prisoner 
and oh, I -- I -- I, yes, and one da
y, I told one of the guards th
at I would like very much to 
work  in the quarry an d he was kind of a nice
 guy.  I'll see what 
I can do. Okay.  So I 
ended up in the quarry, which was about I 
would say 20 miles away
 from the prison, and 
a very, very  large pit which had several levels
.  The levels were occupied by different, 
they were Russian prisoners, French prisone
rs, and we were on th e top and there was a 
rail going up and one of the privileged prisoners
 controlled the brakes, that is he let the 
full lorries go down to the va
lley and brought an empty one 
up and we had to fill each 
lorry with, what, 12 lorries a day or we w
ould get no food, and we -- the rail for the 
lorries then from the brake station were th
en two of the different niches where the 
prisoners wo rked , so I had this and another 
one had this and so on.  And there was one 
prisoner who was quite a bit older than I an
d he obviously had so me practice and he 
taught me how to  pick, how to get a rock 
out.  I never knew what was done with the 
rocks, what kind of mineral th
ey were and they would grind 
them down there, but what it 
was for street construction, road  construc
tion, I don't know. Anyway  there I wo rked  and 
then of co urse we were not in the prison an
ymore.  We had our barracks there.  We had 
our own prison, you know, like 
in a concentration camp.  We
 were a satellite -- satellite 
prison.  The food was horrible, just watery so
up, and if you didn't 
have your 12 lorries, 
you wouldn't get any food at all. The wors
t thing that ever happened was one of the 
guard s was the mo st royal son of a bitch that 
I ever met, b u t we had -- to do our business, 
we had a pole sticking from one place to the 
other and a ditch underneath.  We sit on the 
pole and shit in the ditch so to speak and this
 -- I had sawed half of the pole, and left it 
there of course.  As the weight increased, it 
increased, sudden ly it broke and we all ended 
up in  the shit.  And I assure you, I've wo rked
 in the country, I bread horses.  I know wh at 
horses smell like.  I know what cows smell like
.  I know what pigs smell like.  Noth ing 
worse than human sh it, I mean... 
S o  then, of course (speaking 
German).  So you try to get 
this shit off you and then you 
went, you don't have 
dry clothes and so that was an awful 
incident, and then --
 
Q:  So why did you want to
 work in the quar
ry anyway, I mean 
that's hard work?
 
A:  Because I always had in mind to escape, 
and I felt that being outside in nature there 
would be a chance, and so abou
t close to Ch ristma s '44, I wa
s called before the warden.  I 
said looks like that we as a prison authority
, we are unable to do any good.  You need  
something a little more severe, and I believe th
at the armed forces 
are probably the best 
artznei, (ph) the best, the best --
 
Q:  Medicine?
 
A:  The best medicine for you.  Therefor
e, I consider sending you to  join th e armed 
forces.  And I softly protested I think.  Afte
r I had been in the dungeon twice already at 

that time, I said I'm in no co
ndition to satisfy the demands of the armed forces, so why 
don't you allow me to go home and recoupe a little
 bit and then I'll b e more than happy to  
join the forces. I wa
s excused and then as always, th e other prisoners, you know, you 
walk one behind the other asked what happ
ened?  What happened
?  And I said well, 
they're trying to  make cannon fo dder out of 
me, and one of prisoners reported that he 
wanted to join the forces a
nd they wouldn't  let him, and I had a sense to do it, but I 
protested.  I didn't want to beco me cannon fo
dder.  I was called again.  Did you say that?  
Yes, I did.  All right.  Thank you.  And tw
o days later I was tran
sferred to the youth 
concen tration camp.
 
Q:  So we'll take a break.
 
A:  Okay .
