Margit was a baby, her fam ily m ovedf rom Austria to Prague, Czechoslovakia.  T he arrows on

Here we see Margit attheage of 3. She was the youngest of four children born toGottlieband 

Lily Mora wetz.  Gottlieb, seenhere, was abankerf rom  a religious Jewish f am ily.
 
 
Here we see Margit's fam ily at the Lido,a beach resort in Venice 
in 1926. From the lef tare herbrother, Felix, her cousin Ernie Morawet z, her brother Bruno, 
her mother andfather,and circled is Margit.  And then we have Margit's go verness, Yeya, and 
he
r brother Paul.
 
 
Margit's f ather Gottlieb passed away in 1932when Margit was 
10 years old.  In 1938,Margit was 16, attackson Jews in Central Europeescalatedand her 
m other decided she should leave school in Prague.  Margit was sent to Paris to live with a 
Frenchfam ily where she studied dressm aking.  In1939 Margit's mother joined her in France.  
 
 
T his is Margit with herdoing Flippi justbefore leaving Prague in 
1938.
 
 
As the Germ ans were advancing onParis, Margit's m other was 
ordered to an assem bly
 
point in the south.  Margit bought a bikeand f led with other ref ugees to 
the South of France. Margit f oundout that her m other was atthe Gurs detention cam p in 

Southern France, which is shown here in thisphotograph. She eventually got a train ticket to a 
town outside of Gurs.
 
 
W hen France surrendered to Germany in June
 
1940, Margit's 
m other was ableto leave Gurs in all the conf usion and join Margit.  The two f led via Spainand

. She attended Black MountainCollege in North Carolina andm arried three days 
af ter Pearl Harbor.  Margit would later work for the Office o
fW ar Inform a tion , spe n d time  with  
MGM studios,and becauseof her language abilities worked for theU.S. Army of Occupation in 
G e rm an y,  re

educating Hitler youth.  
 
 
W ecannotdo justice today todescribethe rem arkable journey 
her life would takef rom  there,but it included m any stops inthe U.S. and abroad.  Margit would 
eventually spend 20 years with the Montgom ery County, Mar yland, public school system  
specializing in disability issues.  She remains on theboard of an organization which she 
helped f oun
d thathelps youth with disabilities obtain em ploym entaf ter graduation f rom  high 
school.
 
 
Margit li ves in Bethesda, Maryland.  Shehastwo children and 
two grandchildren.  Her daughterAnne lives nearby in Silver Spring, Maryland, and she ishere 

today to
 
listen to her mother's story. W here is Anne?  Right there in the very back we see 
Anne.

Jehovah'sW itnesses in Puerto Rico.  She recently spokeata teacher training sem inar inEl 
Paso,Texas, organized by a newl y created Holocaust museum .  
 
 
Margit also works translating docum entsf rom  Czech and 
Germ an to English. The f irst docum ent she translated was a mem oir of a Czech boy who was 
15 when the war ended and who wrote his mem oirat age17.  He was sopleased with the 
translation thathedonated the original manuscript to them useum .
 
 
In 2003, Margit's autobiography, " Margit's Story,"  was published.  
Af ter today's program ,Margit wil l be able to sign copies, which is also available inthe

W ith that I'd like to ask you to join me in welcom ing our

[Applause]
 
 
Margit, thank you so very m uchfor joining us andf or your 
wi llingness to beour
 
F irs t  P e rs on
 
today.  I was worried that you wouldn't be with us this year 
because of all of your otheractivities.  So we got down tothe wire.  It™s our second
-
to
-
la s t  
program  and we haveyou here. 
 
 
You have to cover som uch in such a shortperiod of time that 
we're going to start.  Although you were born in Austria, yourf am ily m oved to Prague, 

Czechoslovakia, when you were ver y young.  You lived there
 
until 1938 when your mother 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

sent you to Paris at the age of 16.  Before weturn to those war years, let's start, Margit, with 
you gi ving us a senseof  yourf am ily, your parents, your lif e in thosepre
-
war years in fact, 
those years before you moved to Par
is .
 
>> Margit Meissner: W ell, good afternoon,ever ybody.  I'm  really delighted that som any of  you 
cam e to listen tom e.
 
 
As you saw in thepicture, I hadthree brothers.  And I was the 
youngest of m y parents' four children. And that was ver y uncomfortablefor me because I 
didn't want to be so little.  Andm y brothers thought I was a cute little girl, so they thought Iwas 
a doll. And Ihated the ideaof being adoll.  Ialso didn't like the idea that I was a girl  because 
I thought boys were m uch better
.  
 
W ell, as you can im agine,now I'm  not the youngest anywhere 
anym ore.
 
[Laughter]
 
And I am  very clear tobe a wom an.  
 
 
So we lived a ver y f orm al life.  Ihad a governess who basically 
took care of me and we had a big,f orm al house in which life was ver y circum scribe for the 
children. If  you saw the picture of me with the white socks, the little girl, thef irst picture you 
saw, the white socks were important becauseI went to thepark with m y governess andm y 
goal was not to makem y socks dirty.  
 
 
So when Itell thistomy children who throw anything they wear 
once intothe washing m achine,they think that that was very f unny.  I think so, too, now, by the 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
7
 
wa y, but that's how we  lived.
 
 
My job in lif e in Prague, was to learn.  So m ym other thought 
that he
r children needed to learnfour languages by age 16.  So we spokeGermanat hom e, 
Czech in the street, and we hada French governess and we hadanEnglish governess.  And I 
thought that's how children grew up.  It wasn't true, but that was true for myself .
  
I really didn't 
know that I grew up in a very special wa y.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Margit, you lost yourf ather when you were just10. Do you rem emberm uch 
about him ?  T ell us a little bit about your father.
 
>> Margit Meissner:  I don't remember him  well at all. Inthat kind of social setting in which I 

lived, the children were them other's concernandfathers only cam eto say hello, very rarel y.  
My f ather, I know, loved me very m uch andhe particularly liked to give m e kisses. And these 
kisses were all wet,
 
and I hated them . 
 
[Laughter]
 
So Ihad toovercom e thatas I grew up.  
 
 
M
y f ather was a very educatedm an although he cam ef rom  a 
ver y im poverished, Orthodox Jewish f am ily in  Bohem ia.  Buthe was eager tofoster our 
education.  Andhe would play educational gam es with us children where we had to nam e as 
m any capitals of the world we knew that started with B or composers that started with C. So I 
becam ea good quiz gam e player.  But if  youwould ask me about basketball players, I wouldn't 
know a single on
e.
 
[Laughter]

>> Bill Benson:  You told m e that after yourf ather passed away, you  were under a guardian.  
W hat d i d t ha t m e an?
 
>> Margit Meissner:  W ell, it m eant that m y father had, I presum e, a rather large f ortune.  And 

because he didn'ttrust his wif e to take care of herm oney
 
--
 
because in thatm arriage, I don't 
think she ever was asked to take care of them oney.  Soheappointed a guardian who wa s 

basically in charge of  ourf inances. The guardian was able to give m y m other m oney, a certain 
am ount of money every m onthon which she lived.  T hen when Hitler came to power and we 
tried to leave, there was absolutely no opportunity to try and sm uggle out money, which m any 
Jewish f am ilies were able to do.  But we weren't able to do becausem y m other didn'th
ave 
control of her assets. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  In 1938, after Hitler annexedAustria, yourm other and you made a 

m om entous decision to send youf rom  Prague to live in Paris. T ellus what convinced your 
m other and youtom ake that decision, why P aris and what life was likef or you once you got 
there.
 
>> Margit Meissner: W ell, as I saw in the brandnew exhibit that this m useum now has, which 

is called " Collaboration 
&  
Com plicity in the Holocaust,"  there'sa photograph showing that 
Nazis in Austriaf orcing Jews that were walking the street to kneel down and clean the 

sidewalk with brushes of anti
-
Nazi slogans.  Thathappened shortly af ter the annexation of 
Austria because theAustrian Nazis wanted to show the Germ an Nazis how anti
-
Sem itic they 
were.  And it was
 
thathappening, thefactthat the Jews were m adeto clean the streets with a 
toothbrush that convincedm y m other to think that I was not safe inPrague and to sendme 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD

away.  And France was the country of the great democracy.  So it seem ed that France woul
d 
be a safe placef orm eto go. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  You were living in Prague, inCzechoslovakia, but you were Austrian citizens.  
W as that signif icant?
 
>> Margit Meissner:  Indeed, very si gnif icant. Because when If irst came to France, I was 

m erely an alien. In France som ehow anti
-
Sem itism dovetailed with empty f oreignf eelings.  I 
was not m istreated. I was treatedbadly andaggressi vel y by the Frenchpolicebecausethey 

didn't wantus there. I don'tthink it was because I was Jewish.  It was mainly because I was a 
foreigner.
 
 
W hen the war started in 1939, we becam eenem y aliens 
because we were Austrians.  AsAustrians, we were Germ an citizens, so we became enem y 
aliens. If  we had been Czech citizens, we wo uld not have had the same problem.
 
>> B ill B e n s o
n: W henyou went to Paris,didyou know som eone there? W hat took you to 
P a ri s ?
 
>> Margit Meissner:  My m otherfounda Frenchf am ily that took in borders. The lady of the 

house was a French teacher. And she decided that I was really going to become ape
rf e c t  
French speaker.  Ialready spoke French well enough to comm unicate.  But I had French 
lessons with her,private lessons, every m orning for three hours. Then inthe af ternoon I did 
homework f orher. And in theevening I had to sit inf rontof  a m irror fashioning m y lips in such 
a way that I would nothave aforeign accent in French.  So after threem onths I became a 
pretty competent French speakerfor whom  it was not easy to recognize that I was not French.  

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
10
 
Som uch less of aforeign accent in French
 
than Ihave in English. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Margit, your m other decided that she thought you shouldbe a 
dressm aker
.  
W hydid she decide you should be a 
dressm aker
?  
>> Margit Meissner: That's a good question.W e knew that the Germ an Jews had lost allof  
t
heir assets. And we didn't know where we were going to endupand what would happen to 
us.  So it seem ed tomy m other that I needed to have a professionwith which I couldmake a 

living.  And you have to remember that in 1932 or1938 you didn't go toa department store to 
buy a dress; youhad it m ade. So dressm aking was a ver y respectableprof ession. And Iwas 
ver y good atm aking dolls' dresses, so it seem ed natural that I would go todressm aking 
schoolandthat I would then be able to makea living in
 
whatever country we would wind up in.
 
>> Bill Benson: W henyou went to Paris at age 16, leaving your m other andfamily behind,do 

you recall if that was especially f righteningf or you? W ere you able tof eel like you could adjust 
to lif e in Paris once you got there? 
 
>> Margit Meissner:  I have to tell you that itwas notf rightening atall.  I was ver y proud thatat 

age 16m y m other thought I was m atureenough to leave by m yself .  SoIf elt pretty goodabout 
that.  I was in 10th grade. I was a very good
 
student in term s of getting good marks because I 
was a good test taker.  I was not interested in school.  Ididn't learnm uch.  I was interested in 

boys.  But unfortunately many of the boys that I was interested in weren't interested inm e.
 
[Laughter]
 
So  
leaving was not such a great
 
--
 
was not very dif f icult.  When I cam eto Paris and Ifound this 
lovel y f am ily who tookm e in, Ithought it was great.  And also, you have to understand thatI 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
11
 
hadno ideahow this would continue. Because we hadnom edia. Im ean, today you want to 
f ind out what goeson in the world, you go to the palm of  your hand. W ehad newspapers, 
posters in the street,and we had no idea what was going on in theworld. 
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us about your brothersat that point.  You had
 
l ef tf o r  Pa r i s .  W hat be c am e  
of  your brothers at that time?
 
>> Margit Meissner:  My brother Paul, whom  you saw in thispicture,was in India working f or a 

Czech f irm  when Czechoslovakia was takenover by the Germans. As a Jew, he losthis job 
im mediately
.  Andtheonly country where hecouldf ind asylum was Australiabecause that was 
close to India.  My secondbrother was already in the United States. My third brother was still 

in Czechoslovakia and didn'tbelieve that theNazis were going to enter Czechoslovakia.  He 
thought thatm y m other was hysterical to send me away.  He thought that was com pletely 
unnecessary.  But then f inally, theday af ter the Germ ans entered Czechoslovakia,he was 
able to leave and via England endup in Canada as af ruitf arm er 
in the Niagara peninsula.  
 
 
So that is why we were  all over theuniverse andfour continents 
as a result of thef act that the world was not interested in sending refugees anywhere.
 
>> Bill Benson: W e won't talk about this today, but Margit just returned 
with Anne and f amily to 

a trip to see the relatives in Australia andTanzania.  I've enjoyedhearing about thatm yself.
 
Margit, your m othereventually would leave Prague and join you in Paris as well. W hatf orced 

her tomake thedecision to join you?  And
 
then once she gotto you, what was your lif e like 
then? 
 
>> Margit Meissner: W ell, so when 
--
 
Czec hoslovakia was 
--
 
in March of 1939,people were, 
--

of  course, desperatetrying to leave because they already had the exam ple of the Germ an 
Jews and thentheAustrian Jews.  And m y motherfortunately had a pieceof  paper which 
perm ittedher to returnto France.
  
Bef ore theNazis really had time to im plementall of their 
anti
-
Jewish m easuresshe left two days af ter the Germansentered. In theend she was able
 
to  
takeone small suitcase.  Andthat was basically all that she was able to rescueof  our assets, 
one sm all suitcase.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Your brother, theone that thought your m other washysterical to send you 

away, didn't heplay a role in getting your mother out?
 
>> Margit Meissner:  Yes.  Heplayed a big role.  Mother couldn't
 
--
 
neither she nor m y brother 
could getanexit perm it.  One couldbuy anexit perm it if  onehadthe right connections.  
Eventually he gave both his andm y m other'spassport toa sm uggler.  He gave him a lot of  
m oney for return of a passport with an exit perm it. T hat was a trem endous chancehetook 
because this manm ight have never returned thepassport. But hewas lucky.  T he sm uggler 
returned the passports.  T his was how both my m otherand m y brother were able to leave just 
bef ore the Germ ans cam e in.  So it was a very
 
--
 
he took a great chancetodo this and 
fortunately it turned out well.
 
>> Bill Benson: W henyour m other got to Paris, it would be thef ollowin g spring.  Inf ac
t,  
June
 
1940, when Hitler attacked France, leading up to that,did youfeel that war was 
im m inent, that you were in peril?
 
>> Margit Meissner: The SecondW orldW arstarted in September
 
1939. T hat's when we 
becam eenem y aliens.  Right? W e were ex
-
A u s t ri a
ns.  But the war seem ed very f ar away

becausef ighting only took place inthe easternf ront, inPoland. Butwhen war started in the 
spring of 1940, when the Germ ans attackedW estern Europe, we were still believing that 
France could def end itself. T here were lots of propaganda posters in France trying to reassure 
the Frenchpublic thatthe Germ ans would never conquer France becausethey had this 
famousfortif ication. But the Germ ans were able to go aroundthef ortification; so the 
fortif ication didn't help at all.  W ebelieved the Frenchpropaganda, that we had nothing to 
worr y about, that France would beable todefend itself .
 
>> Bill Benson:  In June
 
1940, when Germ any did attack France, you and your mother becam e 
separated and you were f orced to f lee f r
om  Paris.  Tell us about that extraordinary tim e, you're 
leaving Paris and what you didf rom  there, what you know of  whathappenedto yourm other at 

th a t p o int. 
 
>> Margit Meissner: W ell, af ew weeks bef ore Francefell, the French police decidedto 
evacua
te non
-
wantedforeignersf rom the Paris region because they were af raidof  spies. So 
m y m other was gi ven noticethat she shouldpresent herself atthe police station two daysfrom  

today and with enough food f orthree days and two blankets and she would be
 
evacuated; 
which basically m eant deported, but we didn't understand that.
  
And I took her to the police 
station.  Andas we lef t, she gave me a sum  of money, which I didn'tknow she had because as 
far as I knew, we hadno m oney at all. She gave m e thism oney and said, " It's up to youto get 
us out of here."  
 
 
Now, I hadno idea where they were taking her, absolutely I 
didn't know.  I justthought that maybe she was saf er because she wouldbe far in the south.

And then a couple of days later it looked out thatall of  France was going to collapse,Pariswas 
going to beevacuated.  
 
 
A day before theGermans entered Paris If inally decided thatI 
hadto getout of Paris.  I describe this in great detail inm y book what led to thatdecision.  

Eventually, because there were no trains andno buses, no way to leave, I bought a bicycle 
with the money thatmotherhad given m e and lef tParis on abicycl e the day bef orethe 
Germ ans entered.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And that bicycle, how did you get the bicycle?  I know you bought it, but.
 
>> Margit Meissner:  I bought it because I went all through Paris searching f ora bicycle onthat 
day.  And there were no bicycles left.  Finally i n a storefar away from where I lived there was 
onebicycle with am an's racing handles on the handlebar. And Ibought that racing bike, andI 
took
 
--
 
I was not a good bicyclist.  I just knew how to ride a bicycle.  I had with mea little case 
which includeda change of  underwear, two chocolate croissantsand m y dressmaking notes 

anda box of  oil paints because I was in art school. As a dressdesigner, you had to be able 
to
 
--
 
you had to be anartist.  So I thought m y oil paints were ver y im portant. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  So you were thinking in terms of  how you m ight m ake a living once you got 

outs
i de  of  P a r i s .
 
>> Margit Meissner:  Right.
 
>> Bill Benson:  As you were leaving your building tof indthe bikeand leave, the concierge in 
thebuilding where you were li ving handed you an envelope.
 
>> Margit Meissner:  Just asI was leaving the house. T hat's correct.  It was ver y im portant.

He handedm eanenvelope that I stuck intoa pocketand started bicyclin g.  I bicycled all day.  
I was not hungry.  I wa s not tired. I didn'teatm y chocolate becauseI was just bicycling.  And I 
hadfelt very sorr y f orm yself ,because I didn't know whether I was doing the right thing.  Ididn't 
know where I was goin g.  
 
 
I was this ver y proper young lady. W as it proper f or m e to be on 
the roadby m yself ?W hat would I do? W as it, you know
 
--
 
m y breeding was ver y m uch
 
ingrained in who I was.  And Idid not have the right papers because thepolice wouldnot let 
me
 
--
 
give m e a passfor m e to be onthe roads.  Andevery tim e I saw a policeman, therewere 
plenty around,I was convinced he was looking for me. T hey didn'tcare, but tom e that's what 

it sounded like. So it was very scar y.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And,of  course, you were among m any, m any others f leeing Paris. And you 

found thatthe bicycle really turnedouttobea real blessing.
 
>> Margit Meissner:  A real blessing becausethe roads were com pletely congested.  People 

were dri ving cars and they didn't know how to drive.  T hey were dri vi ng cars without gas, so 
they got stuck there.  And it turned out thatI was very f ortunateonmy bic ycle.  I was able to 
get around
 
the stuck cars.  So inm any ways that was a lucky, lucky thing that Ihad abike.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So af ter bicycling all day, wh ere do you end up?
 
>> Margit Meissner:  I cam e toa sm all town called Etam pes.  Apolicem an saw me.  I thought:  
he's going to

night, there is a school two blocksf rom  here. Go to the schoolandyou can spend the night on

I took m y bike, wenttothe schooland laiddown on 
the f loor of  
the classroom. T henI rem embered I had that letter inm y pocket. So I opened that letter and 
found it was som ebody who knew where m y m other was who wanted me to know that shewas 
in a detention center in Gurs, which was at the Spanish
-
French
 
bo r de r  i n  t he
 
Pyrenees.  So I 
hadone great advantage, that I knew where m y m other was, but I had no idea where Gurs 

was.  T his was just a nam e on them ap that nobody knew.
 
>> Bill Benson: W here did you intend to go?
 
>> Margit Meissner:  I was going to go to Brittany, to the westernpart of  Francebecausethe 
only other people whowere in the sam e position thatI was was the granddaughterof  Sigmund 
Freud, thepsychiatrist, Sophie Freud, who was a goodf riend of m ine.  Mostof  ourf riends 
were C zech citizens.  So they didn'thave the same problem s that Ihad. T hey were notenem y 
aliens. Butthe Freuds were also enem y aliens.  And the Freudfam ily was all in England. W e 
thought if  we couldm eet in Brest, in Brittany, we couldf inda boat to England.  And
 
that's 
where we were going.
 
 
No w,  I  wa s  b ic yc lin g

to get back to m y stay in the school. I 
spent the night there.  At daybreak I gotup,because I couldn't sleep anywa y, and I continued 

riding.  I didn't realize until afew days later that the school in which I had slept the night was 
bombed to sm ithereens a coupleof hoursaf ter I lef t.  So that was trem endous luck.
 
 
T hen I continued riding.  A few m inutes later, I collided with 
another lady. W eboth fell off the bike.  Ipickedm y bike up.  It was pretty dam aged, but I 
could continue riding. So I just pickedm yself up,and I continued riding.
  
Suddenly a young

m an com es up to m e.  It was im mediately

I f roze. W hat doesthisyoung m an want?  He 
said, " You cannot continue riding like this.  You are going to losetoom uch blood."   AndI 
looked atm y leg, andsure enough it was bleeding profusely.  ButIhadn't noticed.  In the rush 
of  continuing I didnotnoticethat I was wounded.  And, indeed,now that I saw that it was 
bleeding,now it started to h
u r t.  
 
 
So he said, ﬁYou go toa pharmacist and have that leg bandaged 
otherwise you wil l die of  blood loss.ﬂ  So I went to the pharmacy.  And thepharm acist took a 
look at that and said, ﬁYou have to goto thehospital tobebandaged.ﬂ  I said, ﬁI cannot 
go to 
thehospital.  Justf ix it.ﬂ  So he bandaged it. T henhe said," And why are you going by 
bicycle? W hydon't you take the train?"  AndI said thereareno trains in France. There were 
no trains in Paris.  But there were trains in the South of France. So, indeed
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  You mean they weren't running.
 
>> Margit Meissner:  Right.  SoI eventually ended up at the train station with my bicycle.
 
>> Bill Benson: T here you are atthe train station.  And youused thephrase, I think, 

K af k ae s qu e
, your train trip. T ell us a little about that. 
 
>> Margit Meissner: W ell, the train
 
--
 
f irst of all, I have to tell you that while I was waiting f or a 
ticket at the train station, there was anair raid alarm and ﬁEverybody to thebasem ent.ﬂ And I 
looke
d atthis large group of people who were waiting to buy ticketsand I thought:  I can't go to 
thebasem ent, goto the back of the line again, I can't stand it. SoIdid not go to the basem ent, 
andthat was a trem endous chance I took because we saw thebombsf alling onboth sides of  
the railway station.  But itf ortunately did not hit us. So that was another one of those very 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
18
 
lucky m omentsthat I wasfortunate to live through.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So in the all clear signal, there you areat thef rontofthe l
ine.
 
>> Margit Meissner: W ell, I was inf rontof  the line.  And I was buying a ticket to Brittany, to 
Brest. Andthey said, ﬁYou can register yourbicycle.ﬂ  I registeredm y bicycle.  I thought the 
train was going to be com pletely crowded.  Itwas nighttim e. Therewas curf ew.  It was very 
dark.  No lights. I went into thetrain,and thecom partment was completely empty.  I was all by 
m yself  in thisdark compartment.  And I was really scared.  And then it occurred tom e that I 
hadthis bar of  chocolate; 
so I ate  it.  
 
 
And then the train kept com ing, stopping andstarting, stopping 
and starting.  At onepoint we stood on the rail next to atroupe train.  And I was standing there.  
I lowered m y window.  And on theother trainwas a young soldier who starte
d talking to me.  
And If igured that with m y good French, I could maybe tell him  who Iwas, that he would not 
realize that I was aforeigner.  So the good French was ahelptom e.  So he did ask m e," Did 
you have anything toeat?"  I said,no, just the two
 
pair of  chocolatebut I justatethem . So he 
handedme a loaf of breadacrossf rom one train to the other. And bef ore I could thankhim, 

his train started.  And I went back intom y ver y dark com partment. T here was am an sitting 
there. So, again, I thought:  W hat is going to happennow?  
 
 
So there was thism anand I alone in thisbig train com partm ent. 
So after a while when I caughtm y breath, we startedtalking.  He said
 
he was a 
deserter
 
who 
left his French regim en and was going south to hisfam ily.
  
And he said, " Do you have anything 
to eat?"   I said," Yes, I just got a loaf of breadf rom  this soldieronthe other train.W ould you 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

19
 
have some?"   So I gave him m y bread. Andbef ore I knew it, hehad eaten it all. ButI didnot 
m ind.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So eventually the train starts and you go. T ell us, at some point youdecided 

to get off the train.
 
>> Margit Meissner: W ell, Ididn't know.  I thoughtI was going to Brittany.  I didn't know where 

else the train could go.  Then asdaylight started, they
 
were people com ing on the train andI 
realized these peoplestartedhaving theaccentof  the Southwestern French. T hey have a 

special accent in French which I recognized. And then I started asking them where are weand 
where are we going.  So it turnedout that we were going to the southwest.  And when we 
f inally wound up, itturned out that I was 12
 
kilom etersf rom  Gurs.  Im ean,amazing.  Am azing 
lu ck.  

>> Bill Benson:  And once you recognized the nam e, you got off the train.
 
>> Margit Meissner: W ell,
 
then I gotoff  thetrain.  I knew that there were Frenchf riends who 
hada house closeby.  Andthat's where I went. They were ver y will ing and very helpf ul, very 
wi lling to put m e up.
 
 
T he lady of the house, when I told her that mother was in Gurs, 
she 
didn't know thatthere was a Gurseither. Shedidn't know about that.  But shefound out.  
Shehad a car.  It was not perm ittedf or private cars to runduring that period. That was just 

that France was aboutto capitulate. So it was a very, ver y chaotic
 
period in the French 
governm ent. So she was able to drive to Gurs to try tof indm y m other, to reassureher that I 

was saf e.  And she went to Gurs. And, of course, she couldn'tf indm y m other.  But she lef t a 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
20
 
m essage.  And when she described the conditions inGurs, I was sure mother would neverget 
this message.
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us a littleabout Gurs. 
 
>> Margit Meissner: W ell, Gurs was basically started in the 1930's when communists were 
outlawed in France. So it was a detention centerf or French comm unists.  And then during the 
Spanish CivilW ar when many Republican Spaniardsf led to France,tof leef rom  thefascist 
governm ent, so the Republican Spanish ref ugees were housed in Gurs.  And then the French 
governm ent used it f or the unwanted f oreig
ners,f oreign Jews, mainly, whom  they had.  So 
that'show m other got there.
 
 
Conditions were ver y tough.  Mother, whenIfinally m et her
 
--
 
I 
wa s  s it t in g
 
--
 
France had capitulated.  One didn't know what was go ing to happen. Therewas 
rum ors thatthere would be an occupied zone and anon
-
occupied zone.  But news, we had 
none, nothing of any consequence. And Ididn't know what was goi ng to happen.
 
 
I was sitting in the yard of m y f riend's house and allof  a sudden 
f rom far away a wom an com esand motionsatm e or waves tom e. I didn't wave back.  Ididn't 

know anybody who could wave at m e.  Andthis wom an came closer.  She kept waving m ore 
and waving m ore.  And when shef inally cam e close, it was m y mom.  And Ididn't recognize 
her because she was so sunburnedand so thin.  Shehad lost som uch weight.  I didnot 
recognize her. 
 
 
And theone thing shesaid about thisGurs that she never talked 
about was shef inally found her child andI wasn't even welcom ing her.  So that was a great 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
21
 
disappointm ent to her. And I was so stunned to see her.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Before you were reunited with your m other in that sm all town, you hadactually 
been takento thepolice stationat least once. W hy was that?
 
>> Margit Meissner: That's correct.  Because I could not stay in
 
m y friend's house. T hey didn't 
have a bedform e. They knew of af arm house where a wom an would be able to put me upin 
a room  with a slanted roof. So I went there.T hat was thef irst timethat I slept after Iarrive d.  
Because Ihad been on the roadf orprobably 24or 36hours without sleeping. So I went into 
this room  and laid down.  It was in the m id
-
af ternoon.  I went to sleep.
 
 
Suddenly, I hear a knock at thedoor. And Iopenthe door.  
T here are two policemen standing inf ront of m e. T hey were saying, "W eare going tohave to 
take you to thepolice station to verif y your papers."  
 
 
Now, I hadnopapers. But thisfarm  lady who se houseI lived, 
she was suspicious of m e and she had decided to report me to thepolice.  And that's why the 
policemen
 
felt they had toarrestm eand take me to the police station.
 
 
So they tookm e, two burley policem en andme, in them iddle.  
W e walked across thecobblestone squareof this little town.  That'swhen I really broke down.  
I started sobbing. BecauseI thoughtnow is the endand they're goi ng to arrestm e and 
nobody wi ll ever know where I was.  I thought theend of the world had come. 
 
 
W ecame to the policestation.  And thepolice tookone look at 
m eand said, " Lethergo."  So I wentback to thehouseand
 
f inished m y sleep. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  As you told us,af ter that, ofcourse, yourm other isable to slip outof  Gurs 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
22
 
essentially, m ake itto you, and now France is capitulated and youare in theoccupiedportion 
of  France, occupied by the Germans.  So you and your m otherdecide you needto leave the 
occupied zoneand you take off. Tell us about how you lef tand where you were going.
 
>> Margit Meissner:  So mother basically was  perm itted to leave thecam p because when 

France capitulated, the 
d
ire cto r of the
 
cam p of Gurs saidto some of theseunwanted 
foreigners, " You can leave. W edon't need you here anym ore."  Most people couldn't leave 

because they didn't have any m oney and didn't have any place to go to; whereasm other knew 
where I was, she hadgotten that message. And that is how she was able tof ind afarm er with 
a hay wagon who tookher the 12
 
m iles to where I was.  So that's how she cam e tothere.
 
 
W hen we were there, it becam e clear that wewere in the 
occupied zone; we had to go into theunoccupied
 
zone. So with all kinds of
 
--
 
we got outof  the 
unoccupied zone.  To show you the luck thatwe had and how survi val depended on luck, we 

found
 
--
 
we knew there was an em pty, uninhabitedhouse inthe non
-
occupied zone. And 
that's where we were going.  It
 
was abuildingwithout windows, without doors. It had some 
bed studs in it. That's where we spent thef irst couple of nights. 
 
 
It was beautif ul sunshine and summ er.  Idon't quite know what 
we li ved on, but we didn't know what todonext.  Suddenly threem en com e to this house.  And 
we thought:  How could anybody else know about thishouse? And thesethree men were 
Czech Lutheran clergym en. Would you believe?  In this area of nobody, noman's land, these 
Czech m en came andthey, of  course,had passports and good papers.  And they said, "W e 
are going to Marseille," which is on the southern coastof  France,f rom  thereone canf inda 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
23
 
ship and go overseas. They said, ﬁYou have to com eto Marseille. You can't spend the winter 
in this house.ﬂ  
 
 
So we m et these Czech clergym en, again,anotherm iracle. So, 
indeed, we tried to go to Marseille.  Andat that point, we had hiddenall our docum ents in the 
house where I originally endedup, in the attic. T here was a door tothe attic. And that's where 
we hid all theAustrianpassports and whatever papers we had.  Ihad som e letters f roma 
would
-
be boyf riend that I lef t there. And the only thing we kept was our bread rationing card 
because that had no nationality on it. 
  
So we then went to Marseille with our br
e a d r a t i on i ng 
card.  Andthere we had no money. W efound a room in af lophouse.  Andthat's where we 
live d .   
 
 
Andm y m other was completely passive.  This concentration 
cam p experience made such an im pressionon her that she sort of gave up.  She said, "I
f  we're 
going anyplace, if  we're going to try tof ind
 
visas, it's all up to you to decide.ﬂ  So Ibecam e the 
adultand mother was the child. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  And you did try tof ind visas.
 
>> Margit Meissner:  I did try.  And really, again, this incredible coincidence.  In desperation
 
--
 
because in Marseille there were a number ofour Czechf riends whohad gotten there without 
any problem s because they were not enem y aliens. So in desperation itoccurredtom ethat I 
had once heard m y father talk about a 
copper m ine in theBelgian Congo.  I didn't know what a 
copper m ine was.  I didn't know what the Belgian Congo was at thetim e. But all of a sudden it 

occurred tom e that maybe, justm aybe,I could go to the Belgian consulate and say m y m other 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
24
 
andI own a
 
pieceof  acopper m ine in theBelgian Congo; we oughtto go see it. So we need 
to go to the Belgian Congo.  And they believed me. 
 
[Laughter]
 
 
W egotthe visa to theBelgian Congo. And with the visa to the 
Belgian Congo we could get atransit visa toSp
ain, to Portugal f rom  where we could f ind a 
ship to the Belgian Congo.
  
If  you wantedam oreunusual story, I don't think one could make it 
up really. 
 

 
So we had aSpanish transit visa.  That was goodfor 30 days.  
But the French wouldnot give us exit perm its.  I don't quite know why, but the French had 

som ehow prom ised the Germ an masters,because France was now occupied by Germ any, to 
keepall the Jews there so that they could bedeportedto their death.  So we did not get anexit 
perm it.
 
>> Bill Benson:
  
So just tobe clear, you have visas f or the Belgian Congo, a Spanish transit 
visa that allows you to transit into Spain,but you don'thave a French exit visa to allow you do 
th a t.
 
>> Margit Meissner:  Exactly correct.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Ok.
 
>> Ma rg i t  Me i s
sner:  So the day bef orethe Spanish visa was going to expire
 
--
 
so we were  
tryin g to get the exit perm it, withoutany luck. But theday before it was toexpire we m et an 
acquaintance in the street who said that women with your kind of papers were perm itt
ed to 
leave the country f rom  France into Spain withoutanexit perm it at the French
-
Spanish border.  

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
25
 
W ith that bitof  knowledge we decided totake the trainand go to the border.  Again, with 
evading the police that was m anif old, a greatsort of diff iculti
e s. 
 
W earrive at the French
-
Spanish border. W e had to get out of 
the train. As we presented ourselves to the police, they said, ﬁYou can't leave.  You don'thave 
an exit perm it.ﬂ  I said, ﬁBut yesterday you letpeople with these kinds of  papers leave France.ﬂ  
T hey said, "That was yesterday; not today."  
 
 
So here we were desperate. W hatare we going to do?  
Ever ybody lef t and we were lef tbehind,m other and me. W estill had the sam e luggage, 
m other that she wentto the concentration cam pand I thatI lef t on the bicycle with.  That's all 
we had.
 
 
I approacheda porterandtoldhim our story.  He said, " Maybe I 
can help you. Maybe I can show you how yo u can cross the borderonfoot."  So he showed 
us the way across thePyrenees up on the French side,down onthe Spanish side. And then 
he said, ﬁAnd inSpain you canm eet oneof my f riendsand he's going to help you through 
Spain.ﬂ
 
 
So that's what we did. W e took our little belongings and we 
walked.  And he had said, "But be careful that you don't lose your way because if  the Spanish 
police catch you, they are going to arrest you because you will have crossed intoSpain atan 
unauthorized border point."  So we ver y carefully walked across the m ountain.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Itm ight be justaddedhere that walking across amountain,peaks up to 

11,000
 
feet, very steep passes.  So it was quite a walk. 
 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
26
 
>> Margit Meissner:  I don'teven rem em berthatas being so physic ally demanding.  It was 
em otionally, trem endously dem anding because we were constantly af raid. 
 
You  d i dn ' t  k now 
whether you would get there.  Youdidn't know whether anybody was watching you.  So itm ust 

have been,however, physicall y ver y stressf ul. 
 
 
W egetto theother side, and wef ind this gentlem an who was 
going to helpus. Andwhen we get there,heshrugged his shoulders and said, "My God,how 

can they send you here because Ihadpeople like thathere yesterday and they went to jail.  I 
cannot help you.  Youhave to getout of here as quickly as you can.  If  anybody f inds you 
here, I get in t
rouble."   
 
 
So here we were, the Spanish police had seen us cross the 
border. And then when they f ound us, they arrested us and took usto the police station.  And 
there we were, and now what?  
 
 
So Ithought the endof the world had com e. And it was lat
e 
af ternoon, and they took usby the hand. T hey did not handcuff us, but we had a policeman, 
oneform y m other and one form e, and we wenta traintoa town, alovel y, m edieval Spanish 
town, where there was a big police station. W ecome to the policesta
t i o nf u l l  of  r ef u gee s , 
chaotic place.  
 
 
And,of  course, the police was not working there anym ore.  It 
was evening.  So we sat there not knowing, sort of  completely disoriented. It was nighttime.  

T hey had taken away our belongings. W e cam e with nothing.
  
AndI said to oneof  these 
guards that spoke French,becauseI didn't speakSpanishat the tim e, ﬁMaybe we couldgo 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
27
 
som eplace to spend the night because we can't spendthe night here in that crowded room.  
W hy can't you takeussom eplace?  Youhave taken
 
our belongings. W e can't runaway.  So 
m aybe we could spend the night and then in them orning we wil l go to the police director who 

wi ll look at our case.ﬂ  And thefew m inutes later this policeman really m otioned us to come 
with him .  So I thoughtwe were going to spend the night someplace.  
 
 
W e walked. And we walked.  And it was dark.  It was night. It 
was not well lit. W e walked furtheraway f rom  the houses into thecountryside.  I couldn't 

im agine where we wer e going to sleep.  Finally I saw a great big building inf ront of us. One of  
our policem en shouted something to them anacross the gate, the other side. W e kept 
walkin g. W hen we started walking, the gateopenedand we were l et inand we were in a 
Spanish prison.  
 
 
So Ithought that was an im possible situation. Because I was 
sure I was never going to go to prison.  Imean, I was such a law
-
abiding person.  I would 
never do anything wro ng.  Of  course,at thetim eI didn't know thatm any good people were in 

prison because that was not part of
 
m y world  yet.  Sothe idea of prison was just unbearable. 
 
So it was night. W e cam e intoa big room  where there were probably 60 beds, wom en beds, 

andthey gave us a little cotaboutthis sizef or the two of us, with a straw mattress on top.And 
in the morning when we cam e
 
--
 
when theprison directorf inally looked at us, he looked atour 
papers and he said, "Ex
-
Austrians.  So you're really Germ an.  So we are going to call the 
Germ an authorities in Spain, and they wil l take you over."  
 
 
So here we had doneall of  this toescape the Germans,and 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
28
 
then we were in a Spanish prison tobedelivered toGermans. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  And referred to asGermans.
 
>> Margit Meissner:  Ref erredtoas Germ ans. 
 
So we were lucky agai n and again.  IthinkI described this i
n m y book, in quite a bit of  detail. 
 
So we were able to get out of  jail, intoPortugal, where I became a 
dressm aker
 
t o a l l  t he  
refugees and learned som e Portuguese.  It was very good that Ihad this dressmaking skill.  
And then we were able to getan American visa because the Austrian quota, which hadbeen 
oversubscribedfor years, was suddenly openbecause nobody could leave Austriaanym ore.
 
So exactly three yearsafter I lef tm y hom e inPrague we were able to em igrate to the United 

S ta te s.
 
>> B ill B e n s o
n:  I know our tim e is very short,but I'm  going to ask just a couple more 
questions. 
 
 
In thatm om ent,that awful moment where you realized they 
were going to send you back tothe Germ ans, two things I want youto talk about: T ell ushow 

did you get out of there and not get sentbackto the Germ an authorities; and also, sort of  your 
own epiphany about your fellow inm ates. 
 
>> Margit Meissner: W ell, we got out of jail because we hadf riends in Spain who were in 

France with us who had always said we wil l help you get into Spainonce we got back to Spain. 
 
 
T he tim e in prison was a very im portanttim efor m e because I 
was this proper younggirl and all of a sudden here I was in a jail inSpain wherem ost of the 
other inmates were prostitutes.  And I never thought I wouldm eeta prostitute inm y lif e. And

here we didn't have avessel into which ourfood

values are andhow prejudiced I hadbeen. And it really led m eonto a searchof m yself  which 
eventually m adem e into what Iam today.  BecauseI am ,hopef ully, m uch less prejudiced and 
m uch more open to allkinds of people in theworld, and Idon't have f requencies, ideas, ofwho 
people are. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Margit 
--
 
I'm  going to turn back to Margit in am om ent to closeour program . I 
think it's probably obvious to everybody thatwe' ve just glanced thesurface; that we could 
spend the restof  theafternoon and still only gl ancethe surf ace. ButI'm  grateful that you were 
able to spend an hourwith us and, Margit, that you were abletodothe same.
 
 
W e will have onem ore program  this year. T hat's tomorrow.  
And then we'll be done with the programf or 2013.  But look tothe museum 's website about 
information for
 
F i rs t  P ers on
 
in 2014.  
 
 
Af ter Margit hasm adeher closing statementshe will leave 
im mediately and headupstairs where she will  beavailable to sign copies of herbook. W e 
didn'thave an opportunity f or questionand answers.  T here was just too much m oref or Margit

to tellus.  Buy her book if you can.  But at least say hi toher. If  you've got a burning question, 
please ask it.  So once Margit steps off, let her sort of  goonup the stairs.  That would be 
great.
 
 
It's our tradition at
 
F i rs t P e rs on
 
t ha t  ou r
 
F i rs t  P e rs on
 
ge ts the  la st 
word.  So on thatnote, I turn it back to Margit to close today's program .

I am  not going to keepyou.  I work in thism useum asa 
volunteer because Ithink it is very im portantthatpeople understandhow this Holocaust 
happened and th
at itdidn't have tohappen; that it only happened becausenations andpeople 
stood by when this injustice occurred and didn't do anything. Butone of the main reasonswh y 

I am  here is I'd like to tell the world, andespecially the young people, that even
 
if  you cannot 
do a great deal aboutwhat happens in the world at large because you don'thave thatpower, 

you can voteand youcan demonstratebut you do notm ake majordecisions, but in your own 
little world you can have a tremendous inf luence
 b
ecause in
 
your own world when you see 
injustice, when you see children being bullied, when you see people being scapegoated 

because of their ethnicity, then you can intervene.  And then you should not stand by and let 
this happen but get involved andmake sure that
 
people act justly and that otherpeopleare not 
being dem eanedfor who they are. 
 
[Applause]
 
 
T hank you very m uch.
