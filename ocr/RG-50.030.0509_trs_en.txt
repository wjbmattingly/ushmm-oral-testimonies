Beginning Ta pe One, Side A 
 
Question: This is a United States Holocaust 
Memorial Museum interview with Ann Green, 
conducted by Amy Rubi n on July 25
th
, 2006. This interview is ma de
 possible by a grant from 
Carol and Maurice Burke. This is tape number on
e, side A. Mrs. Green, would you please begin 
by telling me your full name  a
nd when and where you were born. 
Answer: My name  is Ann Green, I was born in
 Austria at -- and I was born on August the 28
th
, 
1925.  

Q: And whe r e exactly we re you born in Austria? 

A: In a -- in a town outside [indecipherab
le] ma ybe 50 miles outside, ma ybe more, it™s 
Neunkirchen. I -- want me  to spell it? 

Q: That™s okay. What -- what
 was your name  at birth? 
A: Preis, P-r-e-i-s. 
Q: And did you have any other name
s that you used during the war time? 

A: No, no. 

Q: So, can you tell me  a little bit about your
 parents, their name s, and any siblings? 
A: My mother™s name  was Josephine, my fathe
r™s name  was Berthold, my brother™s name  was 
Ignatz. He never used the name , he hated it.  

Q: What name  did he use?   

A: I -- he was called Bushy, that™s an Austrian expressi
on, little boy. And so he
 never really used 
it, only on pape-- on docume nts and so on.

Q: And tell me a little bit about the personalities
 of the me mbers of your family, your father, 
your mother, your brother. Tell -- give me a little pictur e of each one of them. 
A: They were -- how shall I say it?  In my -- in
 -- as -- as a child looking at them, just norma l 
people, if [indecipherable]. I really ca -- i-it™s
 very hard to say, you know, what -- because you™re 
looking at it as a child. They™re ju
st ple -- nice, normal people.  
Q: You know, a lot of siblings have naturall
y, you know, some  kind of 
s i bling rivalry. Did you 
get along very well with your brother? 

A: [indecipherable] I was, you know, 
sibling rivalry, I would y -- tease 
him. If I really wanted to 

hurt him I called him by his name. But that was about
 the extent of it, I mean, we didn™t -- one 
day he -- I locked him up in the room, an -- and 
he said he™s going to jump out the window and I 
said go ahead. But that™s not -- 
so anyway, we -- you know, there wa
s really not -- he was four 
years younger than I am, and -- so th
ere was not this much rivalry. 
Q: And tell me  more about your parents. Did they
 run a strict household, and also what kind of 
work did your father do and your mo ther, did she work? 

A: No, my mother didn™t, but my 
fa ther was in the scrap metal a
nd then he wheeled and dealed. I 
ca -- really, it™s very interesti
ng that I cannot really reme mber
, because I was very young. Was a 
norma l child, not interested in anything but myse lf
. And -- so it™s very difficult to say. I can™t 
really reme mber, you know, that it wa -- that so
me thing really would have impressed me , or 
interest me . All I was interested is ha
ving -- you know, playing and that™s it. So -- 
Q: We re your parents strict at home? 

A: Yes, and no. You know, European parents, I m
ean, they would be going
 to jail here. But no, 
they -- it -- just a normal fa mily life. My father
 -- when we lived in outs -- in Neunkirchen, my 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509

father commuted from Vienna for awhile, and then
 we moved. So -- but it was a nor -- it was a 
normal, average life, we can compar
e the mi ddle class life to America. 
Q: Tell me  a little bit about whatever me mories 
you have of this first town that you we re living 
in, where you were born. 

A: I reme mb er playing with -- having a friend, which was very interesting. 
Then, of course, I had 
no clue whose -- all her brothers were in the par --
 in the party, the Nazi party, had pictures up of 
Hitler and all. And here she was my playmate. I mean, we were four years old -- four or  fi ve 

years old, and I reme mbe r  that, but otherwise 
-- and we were good friends, we™d -- she would 
come  to my house, I™d go to her house. And th
at -- you know, the parents 
never said you can™t 
play with her or anything. And -- but I doreme mber the pictures because you know, it was 

some thing different with the -- the embl
em, the colors and whatever else.  
Q: Was it something that made 
you uncomfortable in some  way? 
A: I couldn't really -- I mean, I noticed it,
 because you know, we knew what was going on in 
Germany, but Germany couldn™t be compared to
 Austria because in Germany the Jews, though 
they were persecuted, they were not to that extent
. They still had a more or less, if you can call it 
normal life, existence. And that™s all they really [i
ndecipherable] five si -- 
four or five years per -
- no, five -- five, six ma ybe, and that™s it. So -- 

Q: So this is when you moved to Vienna?   

A: Vienna, mm-hm. 

Q: So tell me  about the transition, moving to Vienna. 

A: What do you mean living together? 

Q: Oh, the transition, mo ving from this smaller to
wn to -- to going to the big city of Vienna. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
4 
 
 
A: No, it wasn™t that small a tow -- it was a 
city, but really not. 
Adjusted. You know, moved, 
adjusted. I was -- my parents -- I 
was taken care of. And what are ch
ildren interested in, right?  
You ma ke new friends. And we had fa mily living 
in Vienna, broth -- my
 father™s brother was 
living in Vienna, and I had a cousin. So, you know, 
the transition wasn™t that great. You are in 
the same  country, you are speaking the same  language
, so it doesn™t -- didn™t ma ke this -- there 
wasn™t this gr eat an impact. 
Q: Did you like living in Vienna? 

A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: What are some  of your fonder memories? 

A: Just -- I really -- a nor -- a very norm
al life until 1938, and I reme mbe r  that. I was -- I 
happened to go to the movies, and this was Jean
ette MacDonald, which is long before your time, 
and was May time and here the troops were ma rchi
ng in and they were -- the people we re there 
with open ha -- hands and hearts 
to wo -- welcome the m. And here
 I just loo -- you know, to me  
it was just a move me nt of troops. We  knew th
ere was some thing going on, but nobody really had 
a concept what will be ahead. Because everyt hi
ng was looked at from Germany, and the people 

who ca me  from Ger many. We  happened to know
 -- my father happened to know some body who 
came from Berlin, and the things -- 
the stories he told weren™t that 
hair raising, so we really -- it 
really became  bad after the anschl uss, so -- 

Q: And that™s the day when you were at the movies, that you™re reme mbering? 

A: Mm-hm, yeah. It was -- it wa
s in May, I don™t reme mber the da
te, but I know it was in May of 
™38. 

Q: And wha t  did you associate with, you know, what 
came right after, or what did you think was 
starting to happen right af
ter this?  Di d you know much? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
5 
 
 
A: Nobody -- nobody knew. Nobody had a concept. I mean, nobody could unders -- you know, 
nobody knew that na -- I mean, they were -- the Au
strians we lcomed the invasion, what they call 
invasion, with open arms, and there was -- I s -- 
I presume now, looking back, there was a lot of 
poverty, there was a lot -- there 
wi -- you know, people that didn™t 
have -- there was no work, so 
-- and the Austrians isn™t, by nature
, are not very pri -- used to 
be -- not a very productive person. 
As long as they had three meals, or four meals, and didn™t have to extend themselves, that was 

their outlook in life. And so here they felt, 
you know, they were -- they we re going to get 
some thing, because what did Hitler do?  He took it 
from Peter, gave it to Paul. I mean, he took 

the businesses away, and so consequently the pe ople suddenly became business owners, and 

started ye -- regardless if it had the ability or not,
 they started the mi ddle class life, so to say, and 
were very happy with it.  

Q: So if we could go back a little 
bit to -- prior to the anschl uss -- 
A: Mm-h m.  
Q: -- just to get a little bit be
tter picture of your home  life. 
A: Mm-h m.  
Q: If you could give me  just -- sort of set th
e scene and give like a phy
sical description of your 
home  as you recall it, in Vienna. 

A: We ll, we had a -- we had -- we had a -- tw
o, three bedroom apartment in -- on the third 
district, and it™s very hard to 
describe. It was just a norma l 
apartment and a normal -- what you 
would call an American -- equal in 
to an American life. Not -- not
 -- I -- I really don™t know how 
to describe it to you. Just a very norma l life, 
which abruptly ended, and we got notice that we 
were going to be relocated, that™s what the -- woul
d be call -- and we knew when, and we were lo 
-- no, we were relocated in -- we -- into an apar
tment and we stayed there with another fa mily 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
6 
 
 
and their daughter. It was really a storefront, an
 apart -- and a -- and a room, and a kitchen. And 
my mother, father, my brother and I lived in the 
storefront, and this other couple, who were very 
elderly and their daughter lived in
 the back. And this is how we started our new life, so to say, 
until we got notice that we™re going to be relocated, 
and at that point  we all left . And my father 
happened to have a friend who was not Jewish, a
nd who was an illegal me mber of the  party, and 
he send him a postcard, and he said, if you need 
me, call me, I™m there. 
And my father called 
him. He -- he -- he became th
e director of the sanitarium. 
Q: Do you know his name? 

A: Yeah, his name was Kittel, K-i-t-t-e-l. And hi
s wife  was esn -- his wife ™s name  was Mia, he -- 
his was Leo. And they -- I stayed with them. 
I was this -- I was the niece from the German 
speaking part of Czechoslovakia, from Barin. A
nd I stayed with them for many, many months 
and my father and mother found a place, and for aw
hile my brother was with them, and then he 
moved with -- to Mariani and her husband. Marian i is a friend of ours, was a friend of my 
father™s, and her husband. And they ca -- when th
ey had to vacate their apartment, they were 
going to be relocated so to speak, they came to us and they stay -- they stayed in the kitchen, and 
every time  the chimney sweep would come , they 
had to get up and come  into the -- come into 
our room and stay with us, because he came in 
the back, or the front, whatever you want to call 
it. And my br -- as I said, this 
is -- I™m mi xing the whole thing up.  
Q: So may -- so maybe we can get the chronol
ogy here. So the first time you moved from your 
original home  in Vienna -- 

A: Right. 

Q: That was some thing you did not because 
of a -- a relocation order, or was it? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
7 
 
 
A: Right, I -- I ca -- you know what
?  I really don™t reme mber how 
it came about that we had to 
vacate, and we sold our -- the furniture and 
everyt hing was sold, and we moved into this 
storefront. I don™t know how -- how th
e whole thing came to be, and -- 
Q: And wha t  age are you about, at that time ?  

A: I was 13.  

Q: And so what year is this? 

A: [indecipherable] ma ybe I was 
-- I must have been older, a
bout f-four -- ma ybe 14 -- 14 - 15. 
Q: And was -- was this actually one of the firs
t pl aces where you were in hiding, or we re you still 
living -- 

A: No, no, no, we ju -- we  still liv
ed a so-called normal existence.
 And we were there until ™41. I 
think we mo ved there in ™40 -- in ™40, and we we
re there in ™41, and then we were being re -- 
suppose -- relocated, and that™s 
when we went into hiding. 
Q: What did you know, if anything, about the 
relocation order?  Did you know anything? 
A: It -- it was all underground cr -- grapev
ine, so to speak, you know, you -- you heard, you 
know, people found out, they told you that this and th
is st reet will be next, so you were alerted to 
it by -- by people who knew, and -- 

Q: So it sounds like even before you got the actual order -- 

A: No, no, no, no, you went before, you know, you had to go before. In fact, we had a 

superintendent who was very, very good to us
, and Mariani and her hus
band stayed in her 
father™s apartment, and he gave them a little 
room to stay there, hiding. And the woman, the 

daughter of the people who lived in the same  ap
artment as we did, went there to sleep every 
night, she had -- she -- he let he
r sleep next to him in his be
d. I mean, when you think about it 
now, the situations were such, as I™m recounti
ng them I can™t really believe it, because I™m 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509

telling it to you and I say, if peopl
e will listen to this, what will th
ey think?  So -- and then of 
course, when we got notice to leave, you know, th
at we were being pick
ed up, or rounded up, or 
s -- we -- we left. And at one point we  stayed, 
we -- we move d right in 
next door with Mariani 
and her husband, and when they came for us we c
ould hear them through the wall, because they -
- they came  in and, you know, they were looking fo
r us. And my brother had parakeets, h -- in 
the storefront window. And those birds -- you know, 
they came  in and they ma de a lot of noise, 
of course, and those parakeets started to screech
, and whatever. We  could hear all this. And of 
course they were they -- you know, 
they realized that we left, we
 left everything but what we 
really needed, and went. And that was it. And wi -- 
Q: But you were just next door, and -- a
nd some body could have found you very easily? 
A: Oh yeah, I mean they -- if they had no clue 
that we -- they would ha
ve never, ever thought 
that we would be -- there would be anybody next 
door. So -- it was an adjacent apartment, so -- 
and then of course we ha d to leave because 
people in the building wouldn™t -- knew us, and 
people in the neighborhood knew us, so we really 
had to vacate and find another place to stay. 
And then we just st arted traveling from place to
 pl ace, whoeve r would take  us, we would stay 
with, you know, whatever length of time  we could. 
Because you had to be very careful, because 
if you stayed -- the law over there wa  -- was or is
 that when you are -- 
I think it was a week, you 
had to go to police, and report th
at you are living there. So if 
anybody would have seen us, or -- 
or -- you know, for any length of time, th
at will be a tip off [indecipherable] 
Q: So, if I have this correctly, that™s r
eally when you first went into hiding -- 
A: Hiding, mm-hm. 

Q: -- and this is 1941, we think, and this is wh
en you moved next door to
 the storefront -- 
A: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
9 
 
 
Q: -- that ™s really the -- 
A: I mean, this is the -- we had no -- we had 
no -- we didn't know where we are going to be, and 
so this was the only place we could be for the -- 
for the day or two, or I -- I can™t reme mber how 
long we stayed there. It wasn™t long because it 
wa s one of those very small rooms, a nd so we 

really didn't know how long we™re goi
ng to be there, or wa -- we were
 there, we just -- my father 
found a place for me , and my brother then went
 with Mariani. And 
I can™t reme m -- you know, 
they just -- he -- she took him and I went to this 
friend of my father™s and I stayed there. I stayed 
there for ma ny, ma ny months, and then I changed 
to other places, and eventually ende d up with 
Mariani when they -- when -- because every so 
often I would leave, and then a couple months 
later come back to the same place. And that 
was really a -- you know, it was -- i -- you were 
never any length of time , so to speak. We  had one
 very -- was a very weird thing, I don™t know 
how, when and where, I don™t reme mber that any 
more, but there was an SR ma n who took us in. 
In fact, he took Mariani, her husba
nd, me , my brother, and we stay
ed there. And he had -- he had 
a party, and the woma n who was liv
ing -- the -- the daughter of the 
people who were living there, 
went and she was -- she served -- she served 
them. And her name  was 
Whi ttler, and she -- you 
know, she would walk in and she would say, 
heil Whittler. You know, sh
e would name  her -- 
you -- she would say her name . Nobody could unde
rstand. And here she was, she was -- wore a 
little -- she was a huge person, a
nd she was a little outfit -- 
you know, one of those serving 
things, a little [indecipherable]. 
I mean, those are the -- the funny -- the funny things, but we 
stayed there for a little while and hi s wife, for so
me  reason -- she was British, and she resented it, 
and we had to move, and Mariani, my brother,
 and her husband moved and I stayed. I was the 
nursemaid. 

Q: But this is the ma n who was part of the SA? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
10 
 
 
A: Yeah [indecipherable] 
Q: And how is it that he 
was willing to take you in? 
A: Yeah, he used to be -- when I stayed with th
is friend of my  father and mother, he used to 
come  and visit me , which was very welcome, be cause he would come  in full uniform, you know, 

and he would walk -- come  in -- he always 
came in through the back, through the garden, he 
would -- you know, so everybody could 
see him. And they lived in 
a private house, and that was 
very welcome, you know, they -- they wanted him to come  t o see, you know, so -- 

Q: What was his name? 

A: Spiegel. It was a really, when you sp -- a real
ly -- you would think it™s a Jewish name , but he 
wasn™t. Maybe he was and we didn™t know. 

Q: But you felt safe with him?  

A: Oh yeah. No, I mean, he was -- he -- as I said, 
he was very nice. And then his wife -- it was -- 

the place was so cold -- they didn't heat the upsta
irs, the water fr oze in the water pi cture. I would 
get undressed under the cover, and then in the mo
rning I would take all 
my clothes, put them 
under the cover, warm them up and get dressed ag
ain. It was terribly cold there beca -- why?  
Because they didn™t heat their upstairs. And the -- and the intere
sting part was her father lived 
upstairs too.  

Q: Now, I know we™ve kind of jumped ahead to a 
lot of the experiences in hiding. I wanted to 
just step back and -- and try to jog your me
mory a  little, I know you we
re very young right after 
the anschluss. At that stage, how old are you? 

A: I think 14. I wa -- th
e anschluss was 13, I was 13. 
Q: So I know you™re still pretty young. 

A: I mean it was -- it was a [indecipherable] -- how long -- yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
11 
 
 
Q: 1938. 
A: 1938 I was 13. 

Q: Right. So -- but I wanted to go back a little -- 

A: Okay. 

Q: -- and just to ma ke sure we have a full unde
rstanding. Tell me  the role of religion in your 
fa mily™s life before the anschluss. 

A: We ll, we went to Sunday school, went to Hebr
ew school. At one point I 
could really read, and 
I could write. In Europe, if you were Jewis
h, they didn't let you forget it. So you were 
Conservative, because at that point there was 
no Refor m. And that is 
it, you know, that™s the 
extent of it. 

Q: Did you have certain
 favorite holidays?   
A: All of them, because we always got new clothe
s. That was a -- almost like a ritual. Not that 

we didn™t have anything to wear
 before, but -- but the holidays we wer -- we always got new 
clothes. And it took me  awhile here no
t to buy anything new for the holidays. 

Q: And you have fond memories. Did you have
 in your home  the Passover Seder and -- 
A: Yes, we had Seders which la
st ed forever. And I reme mber my
 grandmother being alive, and 
my brother was little -- he was li
ttle and she wouldn™t let him be 
fed in -- in the house because it 
was Passover, Mother had to go to the neighbor to 
feed him. That ar -- it
™s -- it™s so weird how 
you reme mb er things. And so, reme mber changing 
the dishes and cleaning up and whatever. And 
-- which when -- you know, was -- 
is a pleasant me mory, which th
e children rea
lly today don™t 
have, only if you™re really Conservative, or Orthodox.  

Q: And did you -- did you speak Yiddish 
at home , did you learn other languages? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
12 
 
 
A: No, no, no. We  were what they would call as
similated Jews , you know [indecipherable] that -
- that probably, I mean I don™t know it was a problemor not. But European Jews as a -- as a rule, 
were assimi lated. He -- it -- it™s only th
e population which ma de you understand that you are 
Jewish.  

Q: And -- 

A: But they do the same  thing here. 

Q: How was  it for you as a child, this idea that 
you knew you were Jewish, 
especially in relation 
to non-Jews?  You know, what -- what -- what
 happened?  Any incidents you reme mbe r? 

A: Not -- how shall I sa y?  After the anschluss 
is -- there was a teacher, she was really anti-
Se mitic and she would -- I can™t really reme  -- I 
reme mber she ma de a remark about the Jews in 
class, that I reme mber. But I ca 
-- I wouldn™t be able to reme m -- remi  -- reme mber what it was. 
And no, anti-Semitism i n -- in Europe was -- how shall I sa y?  Li ke here. It was there, you knew 

it. If you really would ha -- if you wanted to be 
killed, you would tell them th
at Jesus is a Jew. I 
mean, that was the worst thing you could have
 ever done, and nobody would ever do that, okay? 
But you were always aware that you were Jewish, 
but for some reason, tha -- my attitude and my 

fa mily™s attitude was, they™re ignorant people, 
and I™m abo -- we are above it. And that™s how 
you survived. I mean, it wasn™t as -- it -- anti-S
emitism in Europe I think was more -- more open 
than here. But whenever the church become s po
werful, then -- then it does not lead to good.  
Q: What about one on one friends
hips?  Did you have mostly Jewi sh friends, also non-Jewish 
friends?  

A: Yeah, yeah, we had non-Jewish friends, I had 
non-Jewish friends. My fa
ther most certainly 
had non-Jewi sh friends. And they would say, you™
d -- you -- you are not like the -- like other 
Jews, you™re a different Jew. I mean, that shows y
ou their ignorance. And of course we did not l 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
13 
 
 
-- we didn™t look Jewish. My mother had red hair
, blue eyes, I had blue eyes. So, you know, we 
weren™t -- we  weren™t looked upon as -- as the -- 
the typical portrait Jew. But most -- I mean, 
most European Jews didn™t look what they were 
supposed to look, or what they wanted them to 
look. So that™s really it. 

Q: What about school? Were you in public 
school, and what kind of me mories --  
A: Oh, yeah. 

Q: -- do you have fond me mories of school? 

A: I do -- I di  -- I think the whol
e thing is overshadowed by the -- 
by the rest of 
the -- my life. 
So, you know, I went to school. I know that I wo
uld ep -- bring ma tzo to school. And I would go 
to school on Saturday and not write, okay. 
But otherwise, school was school, okay. 
Q: Did you go to synagogue every week with your fa mily? 

A: No, no. Holidays, just like -- you know. Loved 
to go to si -- I loved 
to go because it was 
Conservative and you had to be upstairs. 
And for the holidays, as a kid, you could 
[indecipherable] downstairs and of course when there was [indecipherable] you were outside, 

and you went out to play. And you know, it was really -- 
it is -- was the same  type of life as a mi  
-- as a mi ddle class family you lived here. I mean, 
there was really not that
 much difference. So 
it™s very, you know, it™s very -- it 
-- it™s a very long time. So 
you really don™t reme mber, or 
ma ybe you c hoose not to, I don™t know. 

Q: What do you reme mb er about any cha
nges at school after the anschluss? 
A: Wa y -- there was no school. 

Q: When -- when did that happen? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
14 
 
 
A: I think in -- well, there was no school from
 ™41 on, because we went in -- you know, there was 
no school from 1941 on. So I basically 
had very little education. As I 
told my son once, I went to 
the university of life. So that™s that. 
Q: And did you mi ss school, or you had so ma ny other concerns by this time?  

A: You know, there was so -- there was so ma ny 
other things going that 
going to school never 
really -- I don™t think it ent 
-- I can™t say it never, but I don™
t think it ever entered my mi nd, 
because the -- you know, to survive was the mos t  important thing. 

Q: Now you, at this age clearly 
understood that -- that
 to survive, that -- that you are in a 
particularly challenging position as --
 as a Jewish child to survive. 
A: Right. Yeah, no the -- that you realized, I m
ean, you know, that you real -- you realized it and 
I didn™t because at -- we were, you know, at that 
time we were still able to move around the city, 
though we wore the emblem. 

Q: When did you st -- 
End of Tape One, Side A 
Beginning Ta pe One, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of a United States 
Holoca ust Memorial Museum interview with Ann 
Green. This is tape number one, si
de B. So we we re doing a little
 bit of backtracking and -- and 
talking about after the 
anschluss, if -- if -- we 
were at the end of the othe
r side of the tape, if you 
could just tell me  again when approxima tely you 
think you started wearing 
the Jewish star, and 
also what other things started happe
ning that seemed very different? 
A: We ll, my  mother was pulled out to go clean the 
streets, scrub the streets, I was with her. My 
father had to go shovel snow, and at random th -- I th
ink we started to wear the star in ™39, and of 
course when we were hiding we had to take 
it off. And we -- you know, you mov -- at that time  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
15 
 
 
you were still able to move around with your st
ar, you know, able to cre -- come  and go. Once 
you took it off you just had to be careful not 
to meet anybody who knew you, and ma ybe would 
alert them that you™re still around. 
Q: Did you run into people you knew a lot anyw
ay in Vienna? And how did people respond to 
you wearing the star, do you reme mb er? 

A: No, no, because we moved out of the district
, and it was real sheer chance that you don™t me et 
some body. You had to be very careful, and you had to
 be very alert, and it was a -- a very, very 
difficult, very -- very ha rd to relate, because ba
sically, living here -- I mean being an American, 
or in any country, if you haven™
t experienced it, it™s really not
 some thing one can understand. As 
I always say, if I say my shoe hurts, until 
yours hurts, you don™t know. 
You can™t really -- you 
know, you say, oh yes. But it™s very, very difficult 
because it was just a -- a -- some thing you 
can™t compr e hend. And you just do the best you can.  

Q: Do you think as a teenager you actually star
ted f -- you know, feeling real fear?  What -- what 
do you think you felt back then? 

A: We ll, fear is -- was the thing which was 
always with you, or ma ybe caution. I don™t know if 
you understand fear. Fear is only when you are 
exposed to it, you know, when you fa ce it. But 
being -- you were always cons
cious and you always knew and you -- of course you were afraid 
that you are being found out. So you don™t -- I don™
t know. You don™t live w
ith f -- I don™t think 
you live with fear, you live with the -- with th
e thought of hoping that it will -- it will be  over 
soon. 

Q: Now during this time , first of all we see the 
-- I mean, what are the 
things that you™re seeing 
on the streets?  Are you seeing Jewish stores
, you know, things happening to stores and 
synagogues, and what do you reme mber about those sorts of incidents? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
16 
 
 
A: We ll, the stores were da -- you know, defaced, 
and they wrote Jew on it, and the stor es were 
being taken over by people tha -- you know, the pa
rty gave the stores to -- to everybody whom 
they thought was worthwhile being in the party, 
or whatever. And it -- it 
was just some thing you 
can™t -- y-you can™t really rete
ll because that™s [indecipherabl
e] store things happen, and you 
took them -- that™s the wa y it was, okay you -- as 
long as you were -- the drive to survive was to 
be invisible. And th-that™s all you really could do
 to survive, especially when you were hiding. I 
mean, if you walked around with the star,if somebody didn't like your face, they could do 
anything to you, whatever they wanted to, you 
were only a Jew. So you were expandable.  
Q: What do you reme mb er about Kristallnacht? 

A: Just hearing about it, because you weren't pr
esent. But I reme mber as the story goes, my 
mother came from Grodz, which is [indecipherable
]. And they took the rabbi there, and they had 
him -- they held him over the -- the river whic
h goes through town, with a [indecipherable] you 
know, o-on the bridge, they held hi
m there, just to scare him, th
ey didn™t throw him ove r. I mean, 
you ni -- you™re not -- you -- you™
re seeing some thing, you™re -- you™re hearing some thing which 

is really not -- which one can™t
 compr e hend, because they were
n't huma n. It™s like today, we 
haven™t learned. We  really
 haven™t learned. So -- 
Q: And do you think as a teenager you comp
rehended what was happening at the time? 
A: Not really, no. Because I -- when I was a 
teenager, some time s I did things you wouldn™t 
believe. 

Q: Like what? 

A: Like what?  I had -- I had a 
boyfriend who was -- who did not n
eed to wear the star. I didn™t 
wear it, I was already in hiding. 
We ™d go to the city, we™d go like 
teenagers here, okay?  At that 
point I was 18 -- 17 -- 18. We ™d go to a -- we™d 
go to a restaurant, we go -- you know. One day I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
17 
 
 
went to buy a birthday present for my  mother, and 
I left in the morning and I came back in the 
late afternoon. And I remember lik
e today, at that time they had umbrellas, and they had a cu -- 
they were regular umbrellas like the little ones 
now, they had a [indecipherable] and a -- was a 
lea -- it was all of leather. When I came in my
 father took it and ch-cha
sed me . Because, I me an, 
think. There was no phone, there was no way, but you know, you™re a teenager. What -- what is -
- what is the problem, you know?  You™re having a good time. 

Q: And did you feel like you were 
a little bit invincible as -- 
you know, as some  teenagers feel? 
A: I think youth is. I -- I always
 said when I had children, I hope
 -- I have to reme mber what I 
did when I was a child or a teenager , and that  w
ill help me survive. I™ m a survivor  by nature. 
Q: We ll, you were a little bit of
 an adventurer it sounds like. 
A: We ll, I was a teenager. I was not -- I don™t th
ink I was any different than teenagers today. But 
-- and you -- you don™t think what the consequences. I 
mean, if they would have caught me , they 
would have caught my parents. I mean, a whol
e fa mily, and an extended fa mily would have 
gone. Never gave it a thought. 

Q: And wha t  were the conversati
ons like at home if your father was upset for instance that one 
day?  What -- what were the kind of c
onversations you were having at that time? 
A: Like what? 

Q: You know, were you talking about strategies or
 plans for what you would do next, and what -- 
what was -- did you talk about the war? 

A: [indecipherable] you -- you lived da y by day. You -- you couldn™t pl an, because you don™t -- 

you didn™t know what is going to happen. At one 
point, when I stayed with Mariani, I had to 
leave during the day so I got a place to stay at
 during the day, I became the ma id. And her hus -- 
and they were very nice people, 
but her husband apparently wasn™t
 too bright. One day he called 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
18 
 
 
and he said, this is the gover -- some government
 calling, and they know that he is -- he™s hiding 
some body a nd they™re going to come  over and get me . 
We ll, I cleared out of there so fast I must 
have -- I mu st have run I don™t know how ma ny miles,
 just -- and that was in the inner city, and I 
-- we lived in the outskirts. And 
I never gi -- went back there.
 He thought it was a great joke, 
okay?   
Q: He was just kidding? 

A: Yeah, he was kidding. You know, he was -- he wa
nted to know if it -- 
and at th -- and th -- 
you couldn™t walk a -- you had to be very carefu
l. I couldn™t use the vacuum cleaner because 
everybody knew they went to work in the morning, so there wa s nobody supposed to be in their 

house. So -- I mean, i -- totally stupid. Y
ou know, not -- thoughtle
ss, and that™s it. 
Q: I™m just going to take a break. 

A: Go ahead. 

Q: Tell me  what happened to your father™s business. 
A: It just dissipated, it dissipated, you know, and 
that was it. That I understand. So -- and then he 
-- my father knew a lot of -- lot of people and 
he would a -- he was able to -- you know, there 
was a lot of selling and buying, and -- and he kne
w a lot of -- he had a lo
t of non-Jewish friends, 
and that™s what he did. You know, as mu -- as
 -- as well as he could. And that™s how we 
survived, I suppose, to a certain degree. 
Q: Did anything happen to the sy
nagogue where your fa mily went? 
A: Yeah, they burned it down. They burned it down. 

Q: Do you reme mber the name  of it ? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
19 
 
 
A: No, no, no. The only temple which stayed in is
 -- was not destroyed, I 
think, was the -- I can™t 
reme mber the name  now, it just escaped me . The ma
in synagogue in Vienna, in the first district, 
you know?  I think -- no, it wasn't  
central, central is here.  
Q: So what do you reme mber about the actual beginning of the war in 1939?  We re you hearing 

much in the way of news ? 

A: Yeah, we would hear, and of course we al
so listened to the voice of America. And you know, 
the grapevine, it -- it --
 and the circles my father traveled
 in, there was always news, but you 
know, you really -- it -- everything we
nt so fast, and everything was 
so new, that people really 
did not -- I mean, did not comprehend. I mean, we
 had people aba -- when we still lived in the 
storefront, people would come  to our
 house, they put coffee, for afte
r dinner co -- after dinner -- 
the ma in me al in Europe was lunch. And they w
ould come  and have coffee and debate and talk 
and th -- you know, for naught. And, you know, so we
 are -- it™s -- it™s 
some thing really you -- 
you -- you rethink, and you re -- even today when I 
think, or when I™m talking to Mariani, the 
interesting part about it is that we were able to
 lead a norma l life, to the norm of nor m. But -- so 
you can™t real -- you know, when I look back, it™s 
-- you ju -- it just became -- you -- this is what 
you were confronted with, and that™s wh
at you had to ma ke the best of it. 
Q: You sort of adjusted your con
cept of what was normal, it seems. 
A: Yeah, yeah, you tr -- you know, you had to, because ot herwise you couldn™t survive. You cou 
-- you know, you would -- you would just waste 
your -- your energy and strength, which I 
suppose you subconsciously realized that you sh
ouldn™t do. Oh, I™m so far away from you, I™m 
sorry. 

Q: That™s okay. All right, so I wanted to 
know what you were hear
ing about people being 
deported at this time. What -- what sort of -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
20 
 
 
A: We -- 
Q: -- information did you have, if any? 

A: We knew that there was Theresienstadt, and 
-- but we really didn™t know what it -- what it 
was. My parents were deported. My parents we
re caught. How, when and where, I don™t know, 
but this friend I had who was Roma nian, he did not ha
ve to wear a star, so he had mor e  entry into 
places, and he found out that they were deport
ed. He was supposed to meet my father, and 
apparently di dn™t, because  they caught them, and they went to Theresienstadt, and at one point 

you could send food to Theresienstadt. If they got it, we never knew. But we could go to 

different -- different districts, 
and ma il whatever we could spare 
or get together, and mail it to 
them. And t hen, of course, they stopped that. So
 I don™t know if they ev
er received it or not. 
Q: When you were still with your parents, and 
things were changing thou
gh, of course, after the 
anschluss, did you -- I know you™ve talked
 about having an optimistic outlook -- 
A: Right. 
Q: -- and hoping that things would change for the better soon. 
A: Yeah, but my father -- my father felt this no
t going to -- this is not going to last, I mean, 
people would -- they -- because he had so ma ny 
non-Jewish friends, he 
-- he never really 
understood either that it could 
last this long, or anybody could 
even contemplate anything like 
that. So -- 

Q: Do you think you picked up your optimistic attitude  from your parent s?  

A: Probably. Probably. I mean, 
my fa ther felt, you know, why emigrate. And probably, when I 
think about it now, he was in his early 50™s,
 he had two young children, and a wife, and I -- 
probably was afraid, which is very possible. An
d as I said, really no
t understandi ng the -- the 
power. So, he -- we were going to -- I think it
 was Nicorag -- one of those South American 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
21 
 
 
countries, and -- but it never ma terialized. It 
was always on the edge, you know, we we re going 
to go in two weeks, okay?  And then 
it dissipated. So we never really 
-- as I said, he -- it was not -
- he -- he just didn™t have his heart to go. 
Q: What about your mother?  How did she react? 

A: You know, European wives are more -- we ar
e going back 60 years, 70 years, so it™s, you 
know, whatever he felt. And I s 
-- I suppose she wasn™t as keen 
to -- to relocate either. You 
know, you heard -- and then, of course, it stopped, you know. America closed down, and -- I 

mean, th -- a lot of my -- my brother -- my fa
ther™s brother went to Poland, okay, the one in 
Hungary, who lived in Hungary, th
ey lived under false papers. They had Christian papers, and 
they came here, they were brought here by a 
priest. So, you know, not everybody -- the ma jority 
was bad, but there were some  very good people in
 between. So, you know, so people sa - peoples 
the -- the people survived, onl
y could survive in account of
 people who helped them. 
Q: And I guess that would be in your cas
e, people who were willing to hide you. 
A: Yeah, you know, and they -- I mean, they -- they
 put their -- they -- they didn't all do it for 
love. A lot of it was money, okay, but they really 
put themselves in danger at that -- if you were 
found, you know, if your -- if they found you, or 
if some body denounced you, so it™s -- it was a 
very -- it was very, very inte
resting. Like, if somebody today 
would come to you and say, can 
you hide me ?  So, you -- you know, it™s -- those people 
really put their own life at stake. So -- 
right?  
Q: So just to ge -- continue with where we we
re. I know we talked abou
t a number of different 
things and now I want to come  back to the ti
me  when you were in hiding. So if you could just 
sort of summarize. Whe n you started going into hidi
ng -- also at that particular mo me nt, what if 
anything do you reme mb er about co
nversation -- conversations 
with your parents, you know, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
22 
 
 
that you would see them frequen
tly or try to, cause I know at this time you™re separating from 
your parents. 
A: Right. We went into hiding 
I think the end of ™41, beginni
ng of ™42, and I would see my 
parents, I would come  to see them, they woul
d come  to see me . Would bring food which they 
purchased on the black ma rket. And we lived in
 different places, and 
we switched places, and 
really I -- I traveled a 
lot, I traveled into 
-- I was at many differen
t places because I was young, 
and you know, people could not keep me  for any 
length of time. Certain places I could go out, 
other pl aces I could never leave. There was a plac
e in the inner city, in
 the old city where I 
stayed, and I was not be -- I wasn™t able to 
go out, and it was -- it was a big -- very, very big 
apartment with all very old antique furniture, and 
it was very scary to be there, especially when 
you were alone and they always said, if some body 
ever come s in here, I™d be hiding behind one 
of those big dining room ta
ble legs. You -- you think of 
the dumbest things. And -- 
Q: Did you ever have any of those kind of cl
ose calls in any of the places where you were? 
A: No. Yeah, one. I had one very 
[indecipherable] and with anothe
r ca -- in a Jewish house. But 
they were -- they did not have 
to wear a star at the time, a
nd for whatever reason some body came  
into their apartment, some official, and I was 
in the bathroom, and I 
-- in the bathtub, and I 
grabbed my robe, and I ran. I ran up the block, and 
I knew a doctor there, so I went there, and -- 
and that was it. I mean ga -- you know, you -- you 
go -- get into situatio
ns where you don™t think, 
you just -- especially when you™re -- you know, 
you™re running. And you just take off and you 
don™t think. I mean, here I was running, if so
me body would say, look, what she™s doing here?  
Some body could have picked up on it
, and -- and that was it, it wa
s -- the ma -- it™
s really -- the 
whole thing was more luck than anything else. 
Whatever was supposed to be, that™s the way it 
was. But -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
23 
 
 
Q: We re you -- did it ever feel like an advent
ure?  I mean now, looking back, I see that you can 
smile over some  of these anecdotes. At the ti
me was it more frightening and you always had 
some -- 
A: We ll, yes -- no, it wa -- it was serious, it was not -- it was not a game . I mean, this much I 

understood. But at the -- at the 
point of danger, I w -- I wa 
-- suppose I wa s not old enough, or 
didn™t comp rehend that the f -- that fear drove you to move, drove you to run, and that™s what I 

did.  

Q: Now, can you estimate how ma ny, perhaps 
-- approxima tely how 
ma ny different hiding 
places you -- you had in Vienna? 

A: At least 10 or 12. I -- you know, at least. B
ecause certain pl aces I st
ayed for awhile, other 
places it wasn't  convenient to stay. And you know, 
people were fright ened, and so I moved from 
place to place. And some body -- you know, th
ere was an underground communication, you 
know, some body would say -- well, I know so
me body who would -- you could stay with, 
because the people who did it knew some body else, you know, their fre -- in their circle, so -- but 

it was very difficult. It was not
 easy. And some times when I  went -- I think I was the one who 
moved the most. And -- being a girl, and being 17
 - 18, so I was the -- re
ally the one who moved 
the most. Some ti me s I would stay with my parents. They were -- I mean, luckily enough, they 

were always together. And then somebody would 
find a place where I would go and that™s it. 
Q: Now, we re the people who were hiding you 
always receiving some  kind of money or 
compensation? 

A: Yeah, they were -- yeah, most of t hem were 
-- were -- got -- got money, most of them -- my 
mother always brought food. And -- but money wa
 -- there were a few where it was money, but 
most of them did not. It was strictly doing it fo
r the -- for the good of the people or whatever, or 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
24 
 
 
their conscience, or they -- or you know, you 
can™t -- you don™t know. It was -- it was a 
tremendous undertaking for them. 
Q: And were they -- the people hi
ding you, were they all non-Jewish? 
A: Yeah, yeah, they were all non-Jewish. 

Q: And how did you feel in their treatment toward you? 

A: Always very, ver -- I mean, you 
were always taken into the fa mily, or most of the time taken 
into the fami ly. I -- I mean the longest I stayed
 [indecipherable] the longe
st [indecipherable] was 
I stayed with my father™s friend, and I was -- I was ju
st part of the fa mily and that™s it. But really, 
the chances they took we re im -- um -- you know,
 they had -- they had family whom I never 
knew if they knew or if they didn™t know. I mean, you had to be  pretty dense not to, you know, 

but nobody ever said anything or did anything, you know
, so -- I mean, eventua
lly I had to leave, 
and then of course, I went th -- stayed
 with Mariani, and then we were caught. 

Q: When did it begin when you stayed with Marian
i and can you tell me  -- first can you tell me  
her full name , and her husband™s full name? 

A: Her -- her name was Mariani -- Mariani Fier
stein, okay, Brauer, and 
her husband™s name  was  
Otto Brauer. And I think it was -- I -- I was ther
e for about a year, ma ybe less. That was a -- we 
stayed in th -- the place was a laundry and it wa
sn't  the ha -- the house was a shack. It was a 
wooden shack, it had -- it had three bedrooms, a nd 
three -- one, two, three or four -- four so 

called bedrooms, okay, and a living room which 
was also a workplace where the ironing was 
done, and the kitchen. And it had no cellar or an
ything, it was undergr -- it was a wooden shack. 
It was just totally incredible when you thi
nk abou -- I mean, I™m laughing now, but it -- to 
describe it is -- like a lean-to. And th-there 
was a hand laundry, you know, they had kettles there, 
and they boiled the laundry and they scrubbed 
the laundry, we  did too. Just because we had 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
25 
 
 
nothing else to do. And we learne
d to iron on a flat board instead of an ironing board. I became a 
cur -- I could iron me n™s shirts perfect. And we irone
d with an iron with a hot st -- stone in there, 
and it had no back. And of course you did other pe
ople™s laundry, so we had to be careful that 
stone shouldn™t slip out fr om the thing. And then 
we were -- we lived there, and we all -- we -- 
the facility was an outhouse and there was anothe r 
-- there was another man there, hi -- there was 
some thing -- he was me ntally ill. And he lived in 
a little -- also in this le
an-to. And his thing was, 
he was waiting -- he liked Mariani™
s bath water. He used to call 
it -- Mariani came there in the 
summertime, when they moved in it was summertim
e. And he -- we would have four foot of 
snow on the ground, and he would call her the 
summer lady. And we would give him t he food 
which was left  over, but he never at e that, he 
had it in cans, and he waited until it became moldy 

and then he ate it. I mean, the ma n was sick. 
Some ti me s I wonder if he knew what was going on. 
I don™t know. 

Q: How is -- he was living in -- next door, or -- 
A: He was living in another little lean-to, and no 
heat, next to the -- next to the outhouse. It™s 
incredible, isn™t it? 
Q: Do you reme mber it being 
uncomfortable living there? 

A: We ll, I -- Mariani, her husband 
and I slept in one be -- in two 
beds. I slept across, and they 
slept -- I mean, we are laughing, if we w
ouldn™t be laughing, we™d be crying. So -- 
Q: Now, we re you very close friends 
already with Marianne before this? 
A: We ll, Mariani lived w
ith -- with us. I mean, I b -- I didn™t know Mariani until I was 13, when 
she -- when they c -- needed to go some  places, and my father and the lady who lived in the ot her 

room apparently me t Mariani, knew Mariani, 
I don™t know. And they needed to vacate their 
apartment because they were going to be relocated, 
so to say. And they came  -- they -- so they 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
26 
 
 
brought them to us. And as I said, they stayed in
 the kitchen in a -- up in
 a -- in a bunk bed. And 
as I said before, when the chimney sweep came,
 the super came , and said, you have to get up 
because he™s comi ng to sweep. 
Q: And that™s before you went to the laundry place? 

A: Oh yeah, that was long before, ye
s. That was before we even moved.  
Q: How did this arrangement get ma de to hide
 in this shack in -- behind the laundry or -- 

A: I don™t know where -- some body knew of her, a
nd approached her, and -- hers -- hers was 
strictly money. 

Q: What™s her name? 

A: I think her name  was Pukas. 

Q: And so she was the owner, or she ran the laundry? 

A: She was -- she was the owner 
of the laundry and that was it. 
Q: What do you reme mb er of her persona
lity, what type of person was she? 
A: She was not too bright, but a nice person and 
we have another incident where she -- there are 
certain things she had to have, among them was 
a ti -- a goose for Christma
s, and I think Mariani 
told you about that, that we went, we finally got
 the goose, and you shou -- it was a tapestry bag 
we put it in, and suddenly a door --

Beginning Ta pe two, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of a United States 
Holoca ust Memorial Museum interview with Ann 
Green. This is tape number two, side A. You wer e
 telling me  about a story, an anecdote where 
you and Marianne were getting a goose, I believ
e, for Christma s. Can you tell me  again the 
details of the story? 
A: We ll we picked up the goose, and it -- carried
 it in a -- a tapestry 
bag and apparently a dog 
picked up the scent and followed us until we got to the trolley. And got into the trolley, nobody 

noticed that the dog is following us. I got home, 
I had a navy coat on -- I wore, and I had a navy 
sweater, and when I undressed, I was navy. The color --
 I must have perspired so from fear, that -
- th-the colo -- the color came off.  

Q: Is this the kind of thing you were act
ually able to laugh a
bout in the mome nt? 
A: Yeah. After -- after it was a
ll over, we laughed about it. I m
ean, we did not -- you know, wa -- 
we -- for some reason we had either durability or th
e -- I -- I -- I really don™t know what it wa -- 
the drive to survive that we could ma ke light  
of it. We  -- we didn™t dwell on it. We  want -- 
though we were victims, we weren™t the victims  in our mi nd. And you know, we had th -- we had 
no -- it wasn™t in our power to -- to survive, to -- 
to -- so we -- we did th
e best we could, and not 
to let us --  not to sink to their level. 

Q: We re there other humorous anecd
otes during your time in hiding? 
A: As I said, this man who was really mentally il
l, used to love Mariani™s bath water, and he 

brushed his teeth with it. Apparen
tly he liked the soap she used 
or whatever, because at -- what 
we used as a -- to -- to bathe was one of thos
e tin tubs from ma ny, ma ny years ago, even before 
my time. And he would pass by and he™d say, did 
she take her bath? Did she take her bath?  You 
know, this was in summerti me , we  used to be ou
tside and he™d say, did she take her bath?  And 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
28 
 
 
the mi nute she was -- she was ready to s -- throw th
e water out, here he was with his can wash -- 
waiting to wa -- to rinse his m
outh. It was disgusting. I mean -- 
Q: And did you laugh at the time ?  
A: Yeah, we laugh, of course. I mean, that was our entertainment, if you 
know what I mean. We 
-- we -- we -- we created our own 
entertainment. So my br -- my brother used to raise rabbits for 
food, and he worked -- there was a shoema ker ne
xt door and he would work there, and they 
would give him oats, and -- like 
oatmeal, and he would feed it to 
the rabbits. And then he -- but 
he never -- he would never eat them, and he woul
d take them to a nei
ghbor and she would kill 
them and skinned them and whatever else. But he
 would ta -- his portion he would feed to the 
cat, and the woma n was incensed that he 
used to do that. But that was it.  
Q: Why did he raise them and then -- 

A: For foo -- he -- well he -- we ate them. 
We  -- you know, dome sticated rabbit tastes like 
chicken. He would -- that was our supplement of 
meat, but he would not eat them because he 
was -- he was -- he fed them, he bred th
em, so he didn™t -- he didn™t eat them. 
Q: When did your brother join you in hiding, ca
use he wasn't  with you all the time before. 
A: No, I -- I was away. He was always -- he
 was always with Marianne . So I came. 
Q: What else did you do for food?  What else did you eat? 
A: Well, ther e was -- ther e was a lesbian [i ndeciphe
rable] they were gard -- they -- professional 
gardeners, and they had greenhouses, and they would 
bring us vegetables, lett
uce, and things like 
that. And the food was bought in th
e black ma rket. That was always avail -- you know, that was 
available. 

Q: Did you have enough money with you? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
29 
 
 
A: I didn™t have any. Marianne™s
 husband. I didn™t have any. I wa
s -- we were just there, and 
they took care of us. 
Q: And was the woma n, Mrs. or Ms. Pukas, was sh
e involved at all in th
e food -- getting food for 

you, or helping you to get food? 

A: We ll, I pres -- I suppose, you 
know, whatever was being ab -- 
whatever was being purchased 
in the bl ack ma rket, whoever coul d br ing it
, and whoever could locate it. Because the 
[indecipherable] on -- you know, everybody else 
was on food stamps. So you purchased food 
stamps and then you could buy food, or you had people who grew food, and we had chickens 

also, and they laid eggs. And ma  -- Mariani beca
me  the farmer™s wife, and she would go out and 
look for the eggs, I mean, so when you think about it,
 it™s -- it™s -- as sa
d at it -- as it is, it™s 
almost -- you can™t really comprehend it, it™s 
just not some thing -- you look back and you say, I 
really did that?  And th
is was luxury yet.  
Q: Did you ever feel hungry while you were in hiding? 
A: No, no. No, it was -- it -- it 
-- I well -- how shall I say?  When 
I was with my father™s friend I 
lived a very civilized life, and I mean it was civi
lized with Mariani too, an
d with -- with almost 
everybody else, I mean, I -- I moved around, I lived in
 ma ny places, and it is interesting, some  of 
the people must have known. I lived in a pla
ce where she -- the woma n owned a restaurant, a 
hotel and a coffee house, and the wine growers 
would come , you know, to f -- to si -- is -- and 
she would entertain them. At 11 
o™clock at night she would go to bed and she would leave me  
there with all those pe ople until they were all 
ready to go home. And she had a -- she had a -- an 
-- she had a maid and she must have known, I mea
n, i-it was just almost like impossible not to, 
because there I didn't go out, I stay
ed in -- in the apartment all th
e time, so -- I mean, I was in 
situations where you -- looking back now I sai
d, you know, I ca -- I can™t 
comprehend them. So -

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
30 
 
 
- so to relate them, and ma ke people say, that
 is not that™s -- you know, it -- it doesn™t ma ke 
sense.  
Q: Now, when you first left hom
e and you first went into hiding, 
were there certain items that 
were important to you that you coul
d bring?  Or did you have to l
eave pretty much everything at 
home?  

A: Yeah, cl -- clothing. I brought
 -- you know, you brought as much
 clothing as you could carry. 
You couldn't -- you couldn™t carry a lot beca
use you™re moving in some place, you -- you know, 
your space was very limited. But you know, there are 
a few things you took and you also have to 
reme mber I was hiding from the beginning of 
™42 until ™44. There was winter, summe r , so you 

really had -- that was an additi
onal thing you had to fend for. S-
So as long -- you know, as long 
as my parents were around, they were -- they 
-- they took care, but th
ereafter it was really 
Mariani and her husband. 

Q: What™s the age difference between you and Mariani? 
A: She was born in 1910, and -- 15 years. 
Q: And what did it feel like, was she a close fri
end, was she more like a mother substitute, or -- 
A: No, y-you know [indecipherable] in Europe
 you will -- you are -- you -- you don™t -- you 

don™t address people in the [ind
ecipherable] I don™t know wha -- 
Q: Familiar way -- 

A: On a fa miliar basis. You™re more -- I mea
n, I always would call her Mrs. Mariani, if -- you 
know, all those years. And only when I -- when 
she came here, she became  Mariani. You know, 
as -- as we got older -- I mean to her I™m chil -- to
 her I™m still the child, 
okay, that™s -- it™s very 
funny now, but that™s the way it is. So no, she was 
-- sh-she always -- ther
e was always a certain 
amount of re spect, and that was it. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
31 
 
 
Q: Since you were separated fr
om your parents, did you -- do you 
feel that you looked to her for 
certain parenting sort of guidance? 
A: No, I was re -- I was se lf sufficient, self reli --
 not suffi cient, self relia
nt, I didn't -- no I didn't, 
really not. I mean, she told me  wh
en to get on and off, but otherwis
e -- I mean, we ha -- I -- it™s 
very difficult, I mean she -- she di d not a-assume a 
parental type of a -- it 
wasn™t that type of a 
relationship. It was more like, you know, we a
ll lived together. I me a
n, we  slept together, you 
can™t ge t mu ch closer. But there wa
s still as -- a certai n respect.  
Q: What are some  of the ways that even if it was 
not in the style of a sort
 of parental role, but 
some  of the ways that perhaps she he
lped take care of you during this time? 
A: We ll, y -- you know, if I ne -- 
if I needed to -- I would ask 
her for anything, for -- there was 
really no -- no -- for advice or anything, I mea
n, we just lived day by day. There was no -- you 
know, there was nothing that you wo
uld say, what shall I do, or how shall I do. That never came  
into question because there was no -- there 
was no way or no reason for anything like that. 
Q: What about your education?  Y
ou weren't going to school, so -- 
A: No, we -- I -- I -- no, we would -- she [ind
ecipherable] her husband would -- we would do 
ma th and we  would read. And I was an insa -- I wa s an voracious reader, and we listened to the 

radio, and music, and talk, mostly talk. 

Q: Anything you reme mber about your conversations? 

A: No, no, no. I mean, most of it was really politica
l. I mean, we would listen to the -- to news, 
we would listen to the Voice of America, you 
know, and they™re bombing here, they™re bombing 
there and they are retreating be
cause it is advantageous for th
e Germans, but we are winning. 
And, so it was really mostly we were waiting. We -- we would see the pl anes comi ng in and we 

were delighted, you know. Bela -- it™s because it was 
m -- really in an outer district. We see the -

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
32 
 
 
- wa -- Ame r ican or British planes flying over,
 dropping bombs, and we were delighted. I me an, 
when I lived in the city it wasn
™t this much fun be cause every
body went into the baseme nt where 
you were -- I was alone in a big apar
tment house, and that was not fun. 
Q: When wa s this? 
A: That was when I was hiding, you know, when one
 of the places, when the air raid sirens 
came, everybody had to vacate their 
apartment and at one time I was hi ding in the closet because 
they were going fr om apartment to apartment to
 see if all the apartments are empty. And of 
course you never knew if you™re -- this building is
 going to be bombed, th
 -- at that point you 
were scared, but there was nothing you could do. 
You could just wait it out and hope for the best. 
Q: I think Marianne also me ntioned when you™re
 hiding together with her, that while everybody 
during the air raids went to th
e cellar, you would go to the attic. Is that what you reme mber? 
A: No, th-that probably was when we were at 
this [indecipherable] house. No, I don™t reme mber 
that, because most -- as I said, th
at™s the only time we had an attic.
 Otherwise, there was no attic. 
That -- that -- the worst was th
e apartment buildings because here the apart -- the house was 
totally still, there was no
body there, and that was it. 
Q: So you were afraid of both th
e air raid and then being found? 
A: [indecipherable] right. I mean we -- I mea
n, we knew what bombs can do, or ma ybe have 
seen destruction, and it was just th
e eeriest feeling to be in a -- in
 a building, the on
ly person in a 
building, so to say. I p -- the a -- in your im
agination, because you didn™t see it. That™s it. 
Q: So -- so now when you are in
 the hiding place in the -- in th
e wooden shack, I believe, that™s 
behind the laundry -- 

A: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
33 
 
 
Q: -- place, so what -- I just lost my train 
of thought -- when you we
re there -- do you know 
approxima tely how long you were in hiding ther
e, and would you sometimes leave from there 
and come  ba ck and go to different hiding places in between? 
A: Here and there I would leave, yes. Here and 
there, when something became available. I mean, 
we lived in odd quo -- I mean in -- under odd circum
stances. My poor brother slept on a chaise 
lounge which was infested with sl
ee -- with fleas. It was horrendous. 
Q: And whe r e was that? 

A: That was there because you know, you were on 
the ground, there was -- there were just 
boards on the ground as floors. So -- I mean, it -- it --
 it didn't look this terrible. I me -- I™m just 
describing it which is really -- you can™t imagine 
it, okay?  But it wasn™t that uncomfort able, and 
the -- the living room wa s -- 
the bedroom was perfectly fine looking, you know, we had the 
windows and all. But those were the -- 

Q: So you left when you thought there was a better place to go to? 
A: No, not better, you know, just to ma
ke room, just to disappear. And -- 
Q: Cause you were worried about be
ing caught at the laundry place? 
A: No, and -- just ma king room, you know, there we
re so many people, I mean -- so when there 
was some thing else opened up, and some body said, you 
know there is -- you™ll be able to stay 
there, you moved on.  
Q: And about how long in total would you sa
y you were at the -- at
 this wooden shack? 
A: Maybe a year in total. Yeah, 
ma ybe a year in total, ma y -- a y
ear and a half, I 
really ti -- I 
have no concept of time. Course
 it™s 60 -- over 60 years, andI don™t dwell on it. If you were a 
person who dwells on it, it™s a to
tally different story. Not only is
 it -- it becomes worse, because 
your imagination goes, right? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
34 
 
 
Q: Now, I think I heard, also from M a rianne, 
some kind of story about
 the day when it was 
supposed to be your brother™s Bar Mitzvah.  
A: Yeah, yeah, that™s when they caught, and they came [indecipherable] 

Q: And whe n was this and can you tell me  the story? 

A: Yeah, was -- it would be May 19
th
. He was -- he was born in ™29, 
so he was, in ™44 he was -- 
tw -- 39 and five, he was 13. What am I doing
?  He was 13. And we were waiting, you know, for 
my parents to come  and this friend of mi ne ca
me  and he said they were caught. And I cannot 
reme mber any more how -- some body denounced them. Tha -- yes, some body denounced them. 

So -- and he came and he told us, and he was able 
-- he went to visit them in the jail when they 
were in jail, and my parents told thei r interroga
tor that we went over the border to Hungary, so 
they shouldn™t be looking for us because they 
caught the parents, so they knew the children was 
there, but my parents told them that we went -- 
we were sent to Hungary, and that™s -- that was 
that. And then they were transpor ted to Theresienstadt.  
Q: But when did you learn about that? 
A: We ll, they were allowed to write, and they wr
ote to this friend of mi ne, and that™s how we 
knew where they were. You know, when they 
arrived, you know, we are ha -- we are in a 

beautiful place, everything is nice, and that™s 
how we were able to se
nd them f-food. We would 
send a bag of onions or some thing, bag of
 potatoes, you know, some thing you can -- not 
knowing if they ever get it or no
t, but that was -- was -- so -- 
Q: The day of your brother™s Bar Mitzvah, wher
e were you that day wh
en you got this news? 
A: We  were in -- we were hom
e. I mean, we were hiding. 
Q: In the laundry place? 

A: In -- in -- yeah, yeah, mm-hm. Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
35 
 
 
Q: And -- and so he did have his Bar Mitzvah? 
A: Oh no. I -- I -- when we say it would have be
en his Bar Mi -- he was 13. There was no way 
that he would ever have had it, okay?  This wa
s just like a -- you know, here he was, 13, his 13
th
 
birthday. So -- but -- 

Q: How did your brother take the news? 

A: We ll, he was 13. He was not very -- he was 
not very vocal. You know, he was a 13 year old 
boy who lived under very vicarious circumstances or 
conditions and so -- and 
as I said, he wasn™t 
very -- he -- he was not very vocal. 

Q: How did you take it?  Was it some how possibl
e to be optimistic after -- after this? 
A: You had to be. You had no choice. It™s ye -- I 
-- I suppose this is -- we all were -- I me an, it 
was not a pla -- it was not pleasant, we did not
 know -- but we didn™t know -- we had no -- we 
had absolutely no understanding, because nobody 
can -- I mean, it™s not something a normal 
mi nd can comprehend. You can fear, but you really -- 
and -- and also, the optimism t hat it will be 
over, it will be over very soon because America is 
there, and Britain is fighting, okay?  So it™s not 
going to be -- it™s going to be very fast, I mea
n. When he went into ru
 -- when Ger mans went 
into Russia, I mean, th-this was the end, oka
 -- but a -- you we re always optimistic that 

some thing is going to happen what™s going to end it. 

Q: And you were actively following the news about the war? 

A: Oh yeah, oh yeah. In fact, when we were cau
ght, we were interrogated by the Gestapo, and so 

he said, and you listened to the Voice of America,
 and the radio we had, we couldn™t really listen 
to it, but we had a neighbor there, she was Jewi
sh, he wasn™t, and there was a -- the owner of the 
building, her husband was Jewish, she wasn™t, and 
she had two adult children, one -- one was a 
physician and one was -- I don™t know what she was.
 But they were -- they knew we were there, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
36 
 
 
and they would listen or they would call Mari
ani and say -- and her hus
band, say to come  and 
listen to the Voice of America. So when this Ge
st -- when I was interrogated, he said to me , 
ﬁAnd I understand you listened to the Voice of Amer
ica.ﬂ And I said to him, ﬂNo,ﬂ I said, ﬁwe 
could never, ever listen with 
the radio we have,ﬂ I said. ﬁIf 
you put your finger,ﬂ I said -- there 
was an opening in the back and, ﬁif you put your 
finger there, the voice would get -- the music 

would get strong,ﬂ I said, ﬁand if 
you took it away, it died.ﬂ So he 
looked at me  and he said, ﬁI 
don™t know if you™re this stupid, or if you™re pl
aying.ﬂ And I looked at him and I said, ﬁNo, 
that™s the way it was.ﬂ And I was in there fi rst,
 and then when Mariani came , I handed her my 
coat, and I sa -- didn™t say a
nything, you know, and that was it. Bu
t it would -- and then -- I mean 
-- I™m -- I™m -- how shall I say?  We  were able 
to laugh about it, you know?  I mean, it was scary 
at the mo me nt, but I co -- I couldn™t really 
think of anything else, I mean, he accuses us of 
listening, which was a very norma l thing, I mean, he
 di -- he mi ght not even have known, you n -
- but with that radio, you c ouldn™t -- you couldn™t if you woul
d have wanted to. So -- 
Q: When is the last time that you spok
e to or saw your parents?  Excuse me . 
A: Bless you. I s -- probably a week before th
ey were caught. You know, there was no telephone 
-- there was really only when my mother could 
come  or I could go. Mariani and I really moved 
quite freely. Didn™t look Jewis
h. I pa -- what does looking Jewi sh mean, right?  I mean, if you 
would -- if you would be black, or
 you would be oriental, it™s fine
. But here we were. I had blue 
eyes, she had blonde hair, blue eyes, very stat
uesque type of a per -- you know, appearance. 
Nobody looked at us, we  hoped. We  had no papers. We  just, you know, we just walked.  

Q: So you were out on 
the streets often? 
A: Oh yeah. We were out in the street. We  even
 -- we even went to the Turkish bath every 
couple of weeks once, we would go and you know, ma
ke believe we having a great time, and we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
37 
 
 
did. That was -- that was our -- he
re I was, what, 18 - 19?  Going 
to the Turkish baths at -- in 
there, nobody knew who you were, you -- you know. A
nd it was like a bi -- you know, big -- it™s 
not like the bath house here, there we  -- you pro 
-- mi ght have seen them. And this was our 
recreation. 
Q: So you tried to enjoy life when you could? 

A: We  -- we tried to ma ke the best what we
 had, you know, that™s it. 
Like my brothernever 
ventured out, because he was almost six foot ta
ll, and he couldn™t go out because what is he 
doing mi dday on the street, when everybody else is in 
the army, or -- or working?  So what is he 
doing at night out, he can™t go 
out, so he never went out.  
Q: Well, this makes me wonder was it 
easier to go out as a young woma n? 
A: Yeah, you know, because I mean we knew -- you know, we wouldn™t travel the time  when 

people were working, we tried to travel with 
the crowd. You know, don™t --the danger was that 
you me t some body, and in -- in there. But they mi ght
 not even have meant you harm, but in -- in 
their just strict -- just gossipi
ng, or say, oh we saw Annie, okay?  
She looked -- you know. If they 
would s -- [indecipherabl e] to have spoken to us
 it would have been te
rrible, because where do 
you live?  How come  you™re still here, you know
?  So that was the 
danger of going out.  
Q: Now you were aware of -- you said there™s 
this underground sort of moveme nt, you were 
aware of ma ny Jewish people staying there in hiding.  

A: Oh yeah, I mean they -- not every
body knew everybody, but this is how you -- you found 
places. If some body nee ded a place, and you knew 
of some body who mi ght 
or will, you passed it 
on. And that™s, you know, it was like underg
round -- a whole unde
rground circuit. 
Q: Where was -- do you reme mber the address or
 the general location 
of this laundry place 
where you hid? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
38 
 
 
A: Yeah, it was 13 Roebuckerstrasse. I went back 
there and it was -- it was totally cleared, so it 
was the weirdest, weirdest sight.  
Q: When did you go? 

A: Maybe 15 - 20 years ago. My husband wanted to 
go see Austria, so we went. It™s a ver -- was 
a very, very strange experience. 
First of all, I carr
ied a chip on my shoulder to the population, 
and I knew every nook and crevice. 
I could travel the underground, I c
ould travel on -- but I felt 
like a tourist, and then that was it
. In fact, we went to -- where 
was it?  Corinthia we went and the 
-- that was really -- the home land of Mr. Schwar
zenegger, and [indeciphera
ble] of my  number, 
because I wasn't  going to give them the satisfac
tion to say, look at them, what are -- what are 
they talking about we did to the Jews?  So I 
-- I just -- I was not going to give them the 
satisfaction to say that, you know, and they want
ed to know how come  I speak so -- I can speak 
dialect. So how come ?  If I was a war bride?  N
o, I wasn™t, okay?  And Austrians, when they -- I 
mean, it™s stupid to say, are very nosy. And, you 
were a war bride?  N
o. How come  you speak 
such good -- you know. I learned it. 

Q: You didn™t want to tell them you™re from there? 

A: No, no. I mean, you know, I wasn't -- I he -- I 
traveled with an American passport, you know, 
and they can tell where you were born, so she knew I was aw -- you know, but sh-she wanted -- 

they wanted to know, you know, mor e  detail, and I 
wasn't  going to volunteer. And that™s it. Now 
people will say why did you -- why did you cove r 
your number?  I says because I just was not 
going to have them say, what did they say what
 we did to the Jews?  Look at them travel, you 
know?  That™s it. 

Q: Now, I think we™re getting to the point where --  

A: We go to camp.

Q: -- you know, you have been -- where you™re 
found out in your hiding place, but I™m -- I was 
just curious in general, is 
there anything else you reme mber 
as far as anything you haven™t 
already shared, what would be the biggest ch
allenges of this life th
at you had in hiding? 
A: It was just one big challenge, there was no big, 
no small, it was just -- it was so -- to survive. 
And e -- I don™t th -- I mean, I di
d not have the capacity, I don™t thi
nk as -- I don™t know, age or -
-or -- or brain, to -- to rea
lize how dire the situ
ation was, you know?  I mean, you wanted to 
survive and you -- the hope that it will end, that™s 
all. I mean, you -- y-you just, as I said before, 
you tried not to -- not to be di -- 
to -- to -- not to be destroye
d. You lived in your own little mi nd. 
And that™s the whole a -- it -- it™
s really very, very difficult to 
-- to under -- I -- I myself don™t 
like it -- don™t understand it. And looking back on 
it I say, did I really live 
like this, did I really 
do that?  And as I have said ma ny times, that the m --

Beginning Ta pe Two, Side B 
Q: This is a continuation of a United States 
Holoca ust Memorial Museum interview with Ann 
Green. This is tape number two, side B. I think yo
u wanted to say some thing?  Did you want to -- 
okay. So now I wanted to ask you, continuing wher
e we left off, if you would tell me  what 
happened when you were discovered in the hi ding place. 

A: Oh yeah. 

Q: This is the place with Mrs. or Mi ss Pukas. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: The -- the laundry. What happened? 

A: We ll, it™s six o™clock in the morning, we coul
d hear the gate opening. There was a fence, and 
there was a gate. The gate opened, and the 
bedroo m windows faced, and we saw I don™t know 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
40 
 
 
how ma ny c o mi ng in. And they just came in and they arrested us. I mean, they went through the 
whole -- through the place, they were looking fo
r things. And I don™t know if Mariani told you, 
but her husband wrote a me moir, and of course th
ey found it. And he also was -- he had colon 
cancer, a -- operated on, 
but he wore a --  

Q: A catheter? 

A: Yeah. And of course they saw the -- his ma nus
cript and that didn™t help any. So anyway, we 
went from there, they arrested us
 and they brought us to the city
 jail, and there we were, I think, 
for almost a month. We were priv
ileged prisoners there because we 
were the only, more or le -- 
that was mostly mi grant workers, and I wa
s [indecipherable] in quarantine, and the 

[indecipherable] was into a big room. Mariani and I slept on the table because we weren™t about 

to sleep on the -- with them, because we were 
scared. And we would get up in the morning and 
we would go into the washroom an
d strip and wash, because one thi
ng we knew, we had to try to 
keep clean. Those people all looked at us be
cause they didn't know from that. Anyway, 
eventually -- 

Q: And whe n was this? 

A: That was in the city jail. 

Q: But when? 

A: When?  That was in May ™44. May ™44, was it? 

Q: I think she said it was -- 

A: I have it here. 

Q: -- June. Think it was close to that. 

A: It™s ju -- no, I™m sorry, it was in June. It was 
in June -- no, it was in 
-- in June, I think, yeah. 
No, we were deported in June, that 
was at -- it was my -- it -- it wa
s either -- it was either the end 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
41 
 
 
of May, or the beginning of June, because the en
d of June we were deported. We  -- yeah, we got 
-- we came to Auschwitz, to Birkenau. 
Q: How do you think or what do you know about
 the way in which you were found in your 
hiding place?  What -- what have you been able
 to understand how that 
happened that you were 
caught? 

A: We  really -- I really don™t know. The woma n 
who was hiding us, nothing happened to her. All 

the things we had that -- photogra
phs, and little whatever was left
 there -- excuse me , stayed 
there, and Mariani recouped that 
after the war. So we don™t unders 
-- excuse me  -- we also -- she 
also has a deserter -- not -- I don
™t know if -- if she told him he
 can™t stay any more, and he was 
caught. So we -- I don™t know if it was he who was tr
ying to save hims elf a
nd said there are Jews 
there, or  if she became scared and told so
me body, and they went and denounced us. I w -- 
nobody ever knows -- will know. 

Q: It came as a total surprise at the time? 
A: Total. Out of -- out of the blue. No pl
a -- there was no -- nothi
ng said, nobody -- nothing -- 
nobody but the deserter came  -- you know, there 
was nobody new who would 
have -- we would 
have said, oh ma ybe. But it was all the old acqua
intances, or people who 
were aware of us. So, 
really I don™t know. I truly don™t know. 
Q: And you stayed in the jail for -- 

A: A month. 

Q: A month. And what were conditions lik
e there?  You were st
arting to explain. 
A: Yeah, wi -- how and when I can™t reme mber any 
more, but it -- we -- first we stayed in that 
humongous -- with like ma ybe 40 or  50 people. And 
then we were move d into a smaller cell, 
with ma ybe only 20 and then I don™
t know if it was the ma tron or who, took a -- chose us to give 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
42 
 
 
out food and dishes and we swept the hal -- the hall,
 and our -- our s -- we -- Mariani had a pr -- 
and I had a pr -- a private cell.
 I shouldn™t laugh, but it was -- I 
mean, it was -- and they never 
locked the gate or any -- we couldn™t 
go anyplace, I mean we were in jail.  
Q: But it was sort of relaxed conditions? 
A: Yeah, it was, for us it was a rela -- you know
, the breakfast, lunch and dinner was ser -- you 
know, we would give out the cutle
ry and we collected and would 
sweep the floors. So the day 
passed. And Mariani was a ferocious smoker. Sh
e didn™t only smoke cigarettes, she would -- 
they would -- you know, cigarettes were very hard
 to get by. They would take the butt, open it up 
[indecipherable] the tobacco and th
ey re -- either roll it, or re-s
tuff it and smoke it. And -- so one 
day Mariani said, she s -- we have
 to [indecipherable] to get -- if
 you can get to our stuff, and the 
only reason she wanted to get in there because 
she had two boxes of that smelly, old tobacco. 
And the interesting part is she smoke d all this, 
and she s -- that was the end of s moking. Like 
cold turkey, no more.  
Q: When is it that  she st
opped smoki ng?  You™re saying -- 
A: In -- in jail. When -- when she was finished 
smoking whatever she had th
ere, and that was it. 
Q: So you were able to bring a few items with you? 
A: Yeah, I mean, you know. And th-the
 most important was the tobacco. 

Q: Now, you had about a month there -- 

A: A month there. 

Q: -- and what were you th
inking would happen next? 
A: We  had no -- we had really, ab
solutely -- I mean, n-no -- I -- I -- no -- how shall I -- we didn't 
know. We  j ust didn™t know. The only thing we 
knew was Theresiensta
dt. We  didn™t know 
Auschwitz, we didn™t know Mauthausen. I mean, I 
had a very -- we had a 
very interesting thing 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
43 
 
 
happen to us in -- when I traveled with my hus
band, we were in Salzburg. Mauthausen is right 
there, and my husband is a tourist, he speaks 
to everybody and speaking the language -- he spoke 
the -- the bridge was closed, so he wanted to
 know from the policeman why the bridge was 
closed. So he -- they were ma king a movie and the policema n said to him, have you gone to 
Mauthausen?  And my husband said no. So he told
 him how to get there,
 but among other things 
he also said he lived the ri 
-- the -- it™s -- it was a country 
road, okay, and the trucks would go 
past there. There was -- you know, there was the 
road, and there was houses on one side of the 
street. And he said, you know, the trucks woul
d go by, we didn™t know that there was a camp 
there, there were thi -- they were doing this. So
 that™s the me ntality of the -- of -- we didn™t 

know. I mean, we didn't want it, but we just waite
d for him, a nd we opened our arms when they 
arrived. 

Q: So you find it hard to believe th
at they didn™t know that -- 

A: From -- from a -- you know, I have a slanted -- 
I™m for -- that -- that I have a very sla -- 
because I™ve lived there, I -- yo-you know, I felt th
e anti-Semitism all my l i fe, so consequently I 
-- I™m -- I™m talking about the -- more or less, I™
m not talking about thepeople of today, I can™t 
because I don™t know them. But they are probab
ly better educated, and what is a -- a -- an 
Austrian?  Austria was a mi xture of Czechs, Po
les, Yugoslavs, you know, I me an there™s no such 
a thing as a pure Austrian. They all came  from 
the so -- I mean, it was 
the great Austrian under 
the -- under the emperor. So there™s no such a 
thing, so you have a mi xture of -- of people. And 
as I said, I™m -- I™m -- I was -- I™m prejudiced, 
I suppose, and I look at them totally different. 

And so I can™t really
 -- I™m -- I can™t have
 a unprejudiced opinion. 
Q: So you had no idea what was about to happen -- 

A: No. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
44 
 
 
Q: -- but then -- 
A: We  went on the special transport, we were 
only I think 15 or 16 people, and really was a -- a 
regular train car, and we kne
w there was some thing going on, but of course, nobody knew. 
Nobody could in -- nobody ever got out of there 
to tell, and America 
knew, but they didn™t 

spread the word, so nobody knew. America knew wh
ere the camps were, right? So we were -- I 
mean, we know it did not bode well, but we really 
had to see what it is. We had to wait, we had 
no -- what we re we going to do? 

Q: Describe the journey, how 
long and -- and when did you know? 
A: I don™t -- I -- I don™t think -- it 
was just a couple of hours. Wa
s a -- you know, Vienna is not 
this far away from -- from Auschwitz. It 
wasn™t an overnight, it definitely wasn™t. 
Q: And it was a comfortable ride?   

A: Oh, it -- it was a regular third classcoach, you know, we had -- we had the whole 

compart ment -- we had the whole -- we had th
e whole car, I should say, not compartment, you 
know?  And I suppose we  were guarded. That I 
can™t even reme mber, you know, we were -- 
because here we are, we didn™t know
 where we were going. I reme mber -- 
Q: But -- but you felt it was ominous? 

A: Oh yes. In fact, there was one ma n, he was 
alone, and he asked -- he 
had some  gold pieces, 
and he asked Mariani to sew it into his coat. And 
she did. Not that it ever helped hi m, because he 
lost his coat, okay?  So -- 

Q: You were with other Jewish prisoners? 

A: Yeah, we were about with 15 other people. 
We  were with 15 other people. We  -- and there 
was one -- there was one fa mily who thought that 
they weren™t Jewish, th
e -- they converted, but 
they were with us, too. And the mot her died, and 
I think Mariani took care 
of the girl, and I think 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
45 
 
 
the father also survived. I don™t know because I le
ft -- I was lucky enough to be shipped out, so I 
wasn't  there when Ausch -- wh-when Birkenau was liberated. 
Q: So you™re on this journey, it™s not a very
 long one, but when do you first know that you™re 
arriving to Auschwitz?  Tell me  about that. 

A: We ll, we arrived, and we were sele -- you kno
w, there was selection, 
the separation of me n 
and wome n. And in hindsight, of 
course, we -- after we were -- 
we -- after you -- th
e -- we talked 
to inma tes, we found out what was going on. 
Before that you had no 
idea. We didn™t. And 
Mariani™s husband was sent to one side, my brothe
r went in the other side, and Mariani and I are 
-- were together. And we were together for a whi 
-- for a -- in fact, I wanted my brother to go 
with Mariani™s husband and they pushed him back. 
He went right into -- into selection. And 
Mariani and I were in the block together for ma yb
e four weeks or so, four or five weeks, and 
then I worked that we -- I was sent to work in 
-- they tor -- I still don™t 
know what they did with 
it. You tor -- you tore the clothing 
into strips, braided them, and that
™s it. Whatever they did with 
it, whatever they used it for, I 
never found out. And then I worked -- 
I built a road to the east, we 
were transporting rocks a
nd breaking the rocks, and there we ha
d a guard who would let us sit in 
the outhouse by the tower to take a re -- it was br
utally hot, even in -- in Se ptember. No, th -- 
October -- no, was towards -- it was hot. And he
 would let us go in one by one and when the 
super -- the guy who wa s supervising, him ca me  -- 
he came  on a horse, so he could see him, so 
he would call whoever was in there out. I mean, that was -- 

Q: But he gave you breaks, he let you ta -- 

A: He gave us breaks. He  gave -- it was 
a young -- it was a young Austrian kid who really 
probably didn™t want to be there,
 and didn™t agree, and gave each
 and every one of us a break.  
Q: Wa s it very hard work
?  Very hard, ma nual labor? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
46 
 
 
A: It was physical labor. I mean, people brea
king -- you know, breaking stones and loading them 
into lorries and moving the lorries,
 and dumping them in this -- in 
the -- in the road bed. And -- I 
mean, it was physical labor. 
Q: We re you pretty strong at the time? 

A: I must have been. I must have been because
 otherwise I couldn™t -- there™s one thing you tried 
to avoid, and that was being in the hospice. Ok
ay, that was not -- and 
I was there two -- I had 
dysentery, and in fact, that™s wh
ere Mariani broke her nose, she came to visit me and she slipped, 
she broke her nose. But fortunately 
I got out of there, a
nd after I got out of 
there, I -- we did 
landscaping for -- with pick and s
hovel. And they had -- also they
 had Russian prisoners there, 
pr-prisoners of war, I suppose. And there was one 
of them, he used -- they had -- he must have 
been working in an orchard or some thing, and wh
enever we crossed, he w
ould give me  apples. I 
mean, when y -- you know, I reme mb er the -- 
the -- how shall I say?  The good things. 
Q: You remember little mo
ments of human kindness. 
A: Right, you know. And that -- 
I mean, I would -- I would buy 
cabbage. There were people who 
worked in -- in the fields and they would br
ing heads of cabbage back, and I would give one 
ration of my  bread, one day ration, 
for cabbage. And I really think th
at™s what helped me  survive, 
because it was the only -- 

Q: You had no other sort of vegetables, or roughage, or -- 

A: No, no, no, whatever it was, it was boiled.It was soup. The only solids we ever got was 

potatoes. And if you were lucky you were the 
last one, so you can ge
t the peels, too. 
Q: Were you hungry a lot of the time? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
47 
 
 
A: I can™t reme mber. Y-You n -- you know, we woul
d have -- I -- I would have -- we would have 
sit in -- we have food fantasies, we would set 
a table with candles, and the tablecloths and 
napkins and silver. I mean, you know -- 
Q: In your mi nd. 

A: In your -- yeah, you were -- we were talki
ng. The way -- this is the way it™s going to look. 

You know -- 

Q: You would talk with friends 
and fantasize about the future. 
A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know. It™s -- 

Q: And mos tly about food, or other things, too? 

A: Yeah, no, but -- bu -- you know, tha-that was the 
weirdest thing, to se -- here you are, you 
have nothing to eat, you have to watch that nobo
dy steals your bread, or
 you ge -- or you traded 
your bread for a -- for a quarter head of cabbage. A
nd -- and that™s it. So it 
is really -- the -- the 
weird -- I think the weirdness about this all, that
 here we are, we are 
sitting here and we are 
talking about it. Right?  And we 
can laugh, as sad as it is, so -- 
Q: Did you form friendships? 

A: Yes and no, you know. I -- I had a -- a friend which 
-- she died of TB. We slept together -- so 
-- in the work camp. See, I was very lucky because
 I was only in Auschwitz from the end of June 
to October, and at that point they were l
ooking for German citizens. Suddenly I became  

[indecipherable] German citizen. Wa
s elevated. And they were look
ing for laborers, labor for a -- 
for a factory. And that™s when we we re shipped ou
t, and then we were shi -- ther e were -- we -- it 
must have been all the wa y up north, and -- and wh
at is it called, they have -- they have the -- 
right by the -- you know, the -- where th
e bogs are, what is it called? 
Q: That region of -- of Germany, you mean? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
48 
 
 
A: Yeah, and I don™t know what it is called. And 
then they transport -- they had no place for us, 
so they pick -- they pitched enormous tents, like 
circus tents and they put 
us in there, and there 
was a storm and one of the tents collapsed. It was horrible. 
Q: Where isthis? 

A: That was in Germany . 

Q: In a -- a different camp? 

A: Yeah, w-we were on transport. And they kept
 us there for while, and the horribl e part there 

was it was very damp, and it was very wet, and the only place -- th-the onl -- they built a latrine. 

All they did was dig a hole, put -- took the bark
 off the trees and ma de a landing, so to say, and 
then put a log across, and my biggest fear was to 
fall in, to slip because it was wet. I -- I mean, 

you n -- you walked there and your -- your -- you 
wore those wooden shoes and they would stick 
in the mud, you know?  So here you ar
e, going up on this little --  

Q: Like a ledge -- 
A: -- like a -- a platform, but it was all tree -- it 
wa s like an -- a -- a logs, but they had no bark on 
it, because if you had bark on it, you don™t slip. And my fear was to fall in there. And from there 
we went to Bergen-Belsen, and we just hung ther
e until we came  -- wi -- they send us to the 
ammunition factory.  

Q: Now, I want go back for a mo me nt. Do 
you think you would recognize -- I have a map of 
Auschwitz -- of Birkenau, and I don™t know if you w
ould be able to point out any of the places 
where you reme mber being, or -- I know you said
 when you were first there, you were in a 
certain area with Marianne. I don™t know if any of this looks familiar to you. 

A: No. We  were in block 13, and you know wha t  
the greatest -- the most horrible part about 
Auschwitz was, to me  a nyway, was that I coul
d not comprehend -- now I understand, but then I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
49 
 
 
couldn™t comprehend, the cru -- the cruelty of th
e -- of the Jewish peopl
e to -- you know, like the 
blockoma, okay?  I walked -- when we were ther
e, the first day, I went up to a young kid, she had 
her mother and her sister with her, she was 
younger than I am, beautiful, beautiful girl, Polish. 
And I ask her to -- the house -- 
the bunk was empt y, if Mariani c
ould go inside. It was brutally 
hot, and humi d. She wouldn™t let her 
go in, okay?  And I said, if I ever
 come across her, I™ll really 
kill her. I had such anger at her. I did come across 
her. What did she do? At  -- we were li --  at the 
day we were liberated, she -- I s -- suddenly see 
her, what™d she do?  There was a German kid, 
and she knocked him off his bike and she took 
the bike. And I said, you 
know what?  I wouldn™t 
even dirty my hands on her. It was -- it wa
s so -- I mean, I-I could not understand, you know, 
that the -- the kapos and whatever, would -- I 
me an, she wasn't  specially cruel, she was dumb, 
because she had entry to clothi ng and everythi ng, a
nd she would parade  -- she was a kid -- sh -- I 

-- I reme mb er one day she had a pink peignoir with
 feathers and slippers 
and a cigarette holder, 
and she would parade through the -- I mean, sh
e was a kid. She was beautiful but she was -- 
ma ybe she was ma ybe 16 or 17. 

Q: Do you reme mber her name? 

A: No, no.  

Q: Did you have other experiences
 like that, or see other -- 
A: No, no, she was the -- really, she was the onl
y one. But a-as I said, when I was there, I 
couldn™t comprehend the cruelty. But 
that -- that was the me thod. That
™s what the -- that was ve-
very German type -- you know, that™s -- that wa
s their me thod of doing it, because that really 
gnawed in your me nt -- on your mi nd. I mean, now I understand it, because they had to survive 

themselves, okay?  That was their way of surviv
ing. I don™t know what I 
would have done if I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
50 
 
 
would have been in the position. So you -- you can™t 
really blame the m, but 
at -- a-at -- at the 
time, I could not understand it. 
Q: Now you at first were with Marianne -- 

A: Right. 

Q: -- staying with her, and then 
what happened, you 
were sepa rated?  
A: We were separated, I went -- 
see, Mariani had -- she w -- Mari
ani was stateless, so she had no 
-- she did not have an Austrian -- 

Q: And why was that, do you know? 

A: No, I don™t know, that I don™t know. But they were 
looking for Ger man citi -- citizens to -- to 
-- we didn™t know for what. And they wanted us 
to work in an ammunition factory, and we did. 
That™s where we fi -- that™s -- that was the life
saving part of it, because 
I was only in camp for 11 
months.  

Q: When -- when you were with Marianne, or wh
en you were still in Auschwitz but you were 
separated from her, would you still ha ve occasion to see her? 

A: Yes. Yeah, we -- yeah, she was in a different
 -- she was in a different block and I was in a 
different block. 

Q: And how would you get to 
see one another, or -- 

A: Y-You w -- you were f -- you can™t say you we
re free to walk, but you were -- you know, like 
for instance , I once -- I knew my -- my -- we we
re -- when we  were going out for w-work, my 
brother™s group was walking this
 -- we were going the opposite directions, and once I -- I gave 
some  bread for some  garlic. And I -- you know, you 
had that thing that th
ere™s certain things you 
should try to get to eat, to s 
-- to -- like we do today, we go to
 the health food store, you know?  
So -- and I handed it to him and they caught him. They caught me  and they caught him, and I just 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
51 
 
 
-- I happened to -- there was a kapo there, a 
woman, and her boyfriend told me  that he was 
alright at the time. That™s -- you know -- because
 I didn™t know what they were going to do to 
him. It just s -- and he -- you know, he s -- put 
his hand out, I put mi ne 
out in walking by and 
some body s a w it, so that 
was a bad experience. 

Q: And with Marianne you were able 
to spend time with her and -- and -- 
A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, she knew where 
I was, she knew -- and I don™t know where she 
was, but we were -- we were t
ogether and we were apart, and some ti me s we were in the same  
bunk, then we were separated and then 
we come back into the same  bunk. 
Q: Do you think it was important for you to ha
ve some one like that 
-- her there, and -- 
A: Oh definitely, definitely. Yeah [indecipherabl
e] it was important for -- I suppose important for 
her, and you know, I was -- I was -- though I was 
eight -- 19, I was still,
 you know, I don™t know 
if you can say a kid. I mean, I was -- I wasn™t this 
exposed to the world, so at that point I looked 
at her as a -- a -- a co -- how shall I say, guardia
n or si -- whatever, you 
know?  At one point I go 
-- I was desperate, I told her I 
had -- I had lice, you know?  And sh
e said, ﬁYou take care of yours 
and I take care of mi ne.ﬂ 

Q: She was scared to get it? 

A: What? 

Q: Wa s she scared to get it from you? 

A: I don™t know, I mean -- you know?  So -- bu
t there was nothing she could do for me . 
Q: She told me  some  story about showering in
 the mi ddle of the night
, do you reme mb er this?  
Taking cold showers in the mi
ddle of the night to stay -- 
A: No, that I don™t know. You couldn™t go out. I 
mean, at night you couldn™t -- you were in, 
okay?  And the worst thing which could happen to
 you, that was in Birkenau, is -- you know, you

had a bucket for elimination, so there was a thing 
which, if you were the last one in the morning 
to use that, because if you used it the last one,
 it wa s you who carried it out. As I said, if you 
don™t laugh, you cry. Wh en I -- when we first we
nt -- got there, you know, we undressed, we 
went into the shower, they cu
t your hair. They tattooed you and 
they gave you clothes. And you 
have to remember we came from -- that we wa
nt to say norma l life. We  had norma l clothes on 
and here I get whatever they gave me , I know what 
it was. It was a navy blue, straight dress. And 
it had a whatever on there. And I had to go to 
the bathroom and the latrines all have the 
windows. And I™m si -- I™m looking in and I see 
a -- some body standing there 
in the reflection in 
the window, you know?  And I turn around and I™m 
looking for the person. It was me . Didn't 
recognize myself, because my hair was cut, and 
I had this funny dress on, and here I am, looking 
-- looking around, I thought ma ybe there™s 
some body, you know, there must be somebody in 
back of me , it wasn™t me . And at
 -- suddenly I rea
lized, it™s you. 
Q: Wa s this a real shock to your system?  
A: Yes, that was a shock, because you know, I had no mi rr --

Beginning Ta pe Three, Si de A 
Q: This is a continuation of a United States 
Holoca ust Memorial Museum interview with Ann 
Green. This is tape number three, side A.  
A: A transforma tion, yeah, I mean I had long hair. 
Suddenly I -- I was -- we were lucky, our hair 
wasn™t shorn. So -- you know, and I reme mber they
 cut it, and the shock was such, you know, it -
- we was -- within a couple of hours that you 
came from -- want to call it normal environment 
into -- in -- into -- you know, just totally different. 

Q: So this is right upon arrival? 

A: Right upon arrival, okay, you™re -- here I am
. I™m looking. Who is this person?  And the shock 
to see it is me, and I was always very well endow
ed. Here I had no bra on. I 
mean, I just -- it ga -
- it was -- I didn™t un -- I -- I -- I ju
st did not comprehend that it is
 me  right away. I couldn™t und -
-  

Q: So what else went with this feeling?  I m
ean, this was obviously very different than anything 
else you™d already experienced. 

A: Right, I mean, th -- it -- it wa
sn™t life threatening or anything, 
it was just shocking. It was -- 
th-the -- the sudden transfor ma ti
on, that was the -- the thing. 
Q: When did you receive the tattoo? 

A: Right at entry, you know, right
 when we were in the -- we 
undressed, I think -- we undressed, 
our hair was cut, went into the sauna, or even --
 and I think we  mi ght even have gotten the to -- 
tattoo right away, cause wi
 -- went very fast.  
Q: Do you reme mber your number? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Can you tell me ?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
54 
 
 
A: Yeah. A7268.  
Q: And would you mi nd telling me  just this 
little story you me ntioned when we weren™t 
recording, about describing or trying to tell 
young children, your chil
dren and perhaps your 
grandchildren what this numb
er on your arm is all about. 
A: When -- I always felt that y -- very young children, or children as 
a rule, to tell them 

some thing adults can™t comprehend was not necessary
 to convey to them, so I told them that -- 
they wanted to know what my numb er was and I 
told them that when I was a little girl my 
mother didn™t want me  to get lost, so that wa
s my telephone number. And 
they took that as -- a-
as that™s what it was. And as they got older,
 and they heard and they learned and they never 

questioned why I said that. They -- you know, th
ey were old -- when they learned and heard 
about the Holocaust, they were old enough to know 
that I didn't  want to scare them or burden 
them, and that™s it. 

Q: And you said there was something that came up because Marianne has a similar nu mber. 
A: Yeah, Mariani has it se -- 
A7265. And they wanted to kno
w how come  that her telephone 
number and my telephone number is the same . 
Q: Did you ha -- 

A: Similar. 

Q: Did you have to answer those kind of que -- 

A: We ll, at that point, you know, we told th
em, you know. But they were already older, you 
know. Because then they have heard, you know, the kids hear. We  think they don™t, but they do, 

and they mi ght not talk about it, 
but they, at that point they appa
rently knew. And whenever they 
ask a question I would answer them, but I would ne
ver elaborate, because 
whatever they wanted 
to know they -- they were told, but let them digest
 it so to say and if they
 want to know ask more. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
55 
 
 
And I -- I really feel that when 
they ask me  to speak in the -- in
 the temple, I said, the children 
only have to be 13 or 14,
 and -- and that™s it. 
Q: That™s the same  age you were when -- 
A: Yeah, but I never give it -- I just fe lt, you kno
w, the ol -- you know, as I said, I -- it™s so 
interesting because here they ar
e, mi ddle class house, you™re tel
ling them you lived the same life 
and then they see movies and they hear, and then
 they look at you, and it™s
 very har -- it -- it™s 
really not some thing you can understand, you -- or
 imagine. You can look at pictures or 
everything. I™m -- as I have said before, and I™ll 
say it again, that even I 
can™t believe that al -- 
you can -- you can sink this low and come  back. 

Q: Now, when you saw Marianne™s husba
nd Otto going to this one side -- 
A: No, we had -- we had no idea.  

Q: When -- when did you learn? 

A: When we  got into camp. When
 we got in -- in -- into the 
blocks, you know, and we me t other 
prisoners. I mean, I once -- there was one la
dy who came in from Theresienstadt, and the 
chimneys were going and the smell -- I mean, 
you can -- when you -- when hair burns and when 
flesh burns, you smell it. And she thought it was a ba
kery, because that™s what she was told. All 
right? So it™s really -- you know
, it™s not only I who ca -- who, it™s 
-- it™s just some  -- I mean, you 
see the smoke, you see the s -- you -- you have the smell, and she was told it™s a bakery. 

Q: But -- but you knew otherwise pretty soon? 

A: Oh yeah -- no -- well, of cour -- once you™re there, you knew.  

Q: And is that smell one of your
 most domi nant memories of -- 
A: No, no. I ha -- I was -- when I came  here a
nd I ma rried, and I had -- ev
entually had children, I 
wanted them -- I wasn™t ga -- I-I was not goi
ng to burden them with my background. Since I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
56 
 
 
can™t compr e hend, there was no reason to -- t-to
 -- you know, you -- to do that, becau -- you have 
to eat that, because I didn™t have 
anyt hing to eat. I just felt that th
is wasn™t the right approach, so 
I never do -- dwelled on it, and I 
wanted tha -- I consciously, subcons
ciously, I wanted to lead as 
normal a life as one can. 
Q: And you think this did 
help you, this approach?   
A: Yeah, because I -- I don™t dwell on it, I don™t 
feel sorry for myself. It™s a part of history I 
could have lived without, a
nd everybody else could have. Bu
t it happened, can™t be undone, 
that™s it.  

Q: Did you ever at the time  let your
 emotions get the better of you? 
A: I don™t think so, no, because I -- I -- everybod
y™s ho-ho -- every inma te hoped to ge t out, 
okay?  If it wa sn™t tomorrow it wa
s the day after. You -- you -- I 
myself always -- I always -- I 
was invisible. Stand, stand, sit, sit. Three hour
s, two hours, it didn™t ma
tter. [indecipherable] 
brainless, I don™t know. It was just -- I felt that 
this was -- by looking at th
e situation I felt that 
this was the -- the only way to su
rvive. You tried to be well, you 
tried stay out of the hospital, 
and -- and that™s all.  

Q: When did you learn what ha
d happened to your brother? 
A: When I came out, when we were libera
ted, when -- when I came back to Vienna. 
Q: You didn™t know what had happened to him at Auschwitz? 

A: No, th-the -- we said, whenever we get separated, whatever we™ll be, we  come  back to 

Vienna. And -- and that was it. 

Q: And -- and what did happen to him?  

A: I -- he went into tra -- he was 
in tr -- he went in tr
ans -- into selection, he got gassed. So they 
had -- they have -- the Ge rmans are very good keepers 
of data. They have -- every sa -- have -- I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
57 
 
 
can™t find it, but I have it. They
 tell you what transport they 
went in, they tell you when they 
went into the gas chamber, they 
know every -- everything is documented. 
Q: At some  point at Auschwitz you didn™
t see him any more, but you didn't  know -- 
A: No, I mean, and I -- once you ch-changed your wo
rking -- where we work station, he was sent 
someplace else, and they were sent so me -- he worked on a -- on a -- it was like an Air Force 
base, but not active for flying, they we re demolishing the planes which were shot down, which 

they can sal -- it was like a salvag
e yard or some thing. I learned that. 
Q: And how were you -- not that 
it™s possible to console some one
, but did you spend time  with 
Marianne after she learned about 
her husband, and was it possible to -- 
A: No, we did -- we didn't  know. I mean, we -- 
we found out, you know, later, but there was no -
- ye -- you know, you were totally helpless, there 
was nothing you could do. If you went into a -- 
a -- a depresh -- if you would have gone into 
a depression or some thing, it would have been 
detrimental to the -- to your -- to your own well be
ing or survival, or whatever. I don™t think we 
did it consciously, but s -- some -- because the dr
i -- at that point the drive to survive is 
incredible. Even if the chances ar
e small, you don™t realize that th
e chances are small. You are a -
- if you™re optimistic, you are going to get out and 
that™s it, you know, so the mi nd is a very, very 
complicated organ. Is it an organ?  No. 

Q: The brain, yes. 

A: The brain. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: What? 

Q: I think the brain, yes. 

A: Yeah. It™s a very, very complicated part of the body. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
58 
 
 
Q: We re you very worried about being selected as well? 
A: Yeah, yeah. I mean, the last selection I we
nt through was with Mari
ani and I was -- I had a 
rash, and this was a total no-no. And so Mariani 
said -- we were falling back, so by the time -- 
you know, you did anything and everyt
hing, and I kept my clothes he
re -- I me an, you™re naked, 
but you have your possessions. So I went and I --
 so I should be -- w
ith the whole thing, you 
know, a -- apparently they had e
nough, and here I was, and they gave me  -- I showed them my 
number and he gave me  a push like I almost
 no -- fell, you know, but they had enough. You 

know, he didn't want me any more, and neither th
ey didn™t -- and not Ma
riani either, so -- she 
was in back of me . So that was that
. It ™s -- it  i s  t  -- as t h e -- as 
the dice falls, that™s what it is.  
Q: We re the living conditions, wh
at were they like in your ba
rracks where you were sleeping? 
A: Yeah, the regular barracks, I mean -- 

Q: Was it very cramped and -- and -- 

A: Yeah, I don™t -- I can™t reme mber how ma ny we
 were, but we slept head foot, foot head, you 
know?  I think probably te -- I -- I rea
lly don™t know how 
ma ny. At least 10. 
Q: We re you with other Jewish women also 
from Austria, or wh
ere were they from?  
A: No, w-we were -- I don™t really know where they all came  from, but no, no, just -- we came in 

with the Hungarian transport. Wh
en we came in the Hungarian tr
ansports were just comi ng in. 
That™s why I have an A, because most -- most ol
de r Hungarian transpor ts who had tattoos, got an 
A. I mean, they prac -- I mean, it was 
11 months before the wa r was over. 
Q: Now, tell me  about how you learned about y
our parents? Did you learn some thing about their 
fa te while you were in Auschwitz? 

A: No. 

Q: That™s also after? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
59 
 
 
A: No, also after. There wa -- th-there was a 
transport came in and there was one woma n from 
aus -- from Theresienstadt, and I ask her if she 
knew my mot her, a be -- my mother had red -- 
very, very dark red hair, and so I described her to
 her, so she says, yes, she knew her, she walked 
-- she worked in the laundry, okay?  But she said
, you know, she ca -- all ri
ght, this lady came to 
Auschwitz, she doesn™t know what is going to be. A
nd that was it, that™s th
e last I heard. And my  
parents were th -- transported ou
t, one of the last  transpor ts. 
Q: To Auschwitz? 
A: Yeah, mm-hm. 

Q: And whe n did you lear
n about that finally? 
A: Not I -- not too long ago th
at I -- I don™t know how, when a
nd where. I don™t know if it was 
Debbie that we got a -- that sh --
 that we received a -- the notice that on this and this date, they 
came to Aus c hwitz, and they were gassed. 

Q: So you never really knew for sure what
 had happened to them for ma ny years? 
A: No, no, I mean, that™s logi -- that -- you know
, they did not survive, because if they would 
have survived, they would have come  bac
k. And this was -- you know, this was their 
arrangement, whoever come s back, goes back. 

Q: So, there was this one person who gave you 
little breaks when you were working, but other 
than that at Auschwitz, were you working 
very long hours?  Was it 
very difficult work? 
A: Yeah, they -- we all did. We  stay -- I™m sorr
y. We went to what -- appelle, okay? And then we 
went out to work. And then we came back, I 
-- you know, time and days , I -- one go -- I -- we 
came back for a whatever, in the early -- late af
ternoon I suppose, and have appelle, have food 
and go to bed. 

Q: Did you ever get a day off?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
60 
 
 
A: No. Wha t ™s a day off?  We  wouldn™t have known
 what to do with a day off. No, it was -- it 
was -- it™s a -- it was dete
ntion, it was jail, you know?   
Q: Did you feel any connection a
ny more to the religion you™d 
grown up with, at that time? 
A: I -- how -- you know, it™s wa -- I -- I knew 
I was Jewish. I had no -- I had no -- I have no 
anger. I didn™t ask why me . And it was -- I mea
n, I would have never changed my religion, or 
you know, never given it a thought, no.  
Q: I mean, did you pray at all wh
ile you were in au -- Auschwitz? 
A: To survive. But not really pr
ay. Hoping rather than praying. 
Q: So you didn™t -- you di dn™t necessari
ly pray to God during that time? 
A: Probably not. Probably not. You know, just -- 
I -- some how religion never -- never -- never 
entered, you know?  The -- the one 
thing you -- you wanted was to survive. How, when and 
where was up to God, right?  So it™s -- I really can™t reme mber. 

Q: We re there any -- was there any way in 
which you observed any of the Jewish holidays? 
A: No, you wouldn™t know when they were, 
unless some body would have had a calendar 
someplace, or heard someplace, you know -- I mea
n, some  people had entries to offices and 
things like that, and they would say, you know, t
oday is -- whatever, okay?  Now I knew when I 

was selected to -- to leave, it was my mother™s bi rthday because some body told me  that it was 

October the 18
th
. So I didn™t know when I -- you know, but that
 -- that™s about it. It was just so 
happen, but y -- there was no time, you lose time , which is fortunate because you don™t, you 

know, th-that, there is no time.You c a n™t tell a week from a m
onth from a day. Didn™t matter if it 
was Saturday or it was Tuesday, it™s [ind
ecipherable] I mean, to me  not anyway. 

Q: Marianne said that you know, you hadbe very resourceful, of course -- 

A: Very mu ch so. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
61 
 
 
Q: -- and even to learn to steal food. Did you see that, or -- 
A: No, I don™t be -- I never stole food. I always
 wa tched that nobody stea
l from me, but I never 
stole food. And -- and -- and -- and I bought --
 you know, I would -- what is the word? 
Q: Exchange? 

A: Yeah, trade. But I -- no, I never stole food. Th
at™s the one thing I ta
 -- I would -- you know, 
you would be lucky and were able to help to ca
rry the kettle, which me ant that when you -- when 
it was all empty, you had the bottom, whatever wa
s there. But otherwise 
all you had to be was 
the last one in line to get the 
potatoes, you had all the peels, wh
ich was great. But otherwise -- 
Q: Now, what was -- what was the situation 
with your health? Wa s it changing a lot while you 
were at Auschwitz? 

A: I went from 150 to maybe 70 pounds. So when I 
got -- I wa s very sick when the -- when we 
were liberated. I had -- I had diarrhea, and I had 
-- it was horrible. To co
me from the bunk to the 
-- to the latrine was like you -- you 
know, you were lucky if you ma de
 it. And we we re liberated 
the [indecipherable] I think it was the 84
th
 division, and Pa-Patton™s army, they were still comi ng 
down. And they opened the gates and of course
 everybody went out. And I turned around and I 
went back. I ge -- I could have gotten trampl
ed, but I -- it was so scary, because everybody 
pushed out for no reason at all. And we had that-- it was very interesting because the camps for 

the north -- there were camps in -- 
further north, above our camp, and -- 
Q: And now you™re talking about -- 

A: About the work camp. 

Q: And the name  is? 

A: It was in Salzwedel, it wa
s a -- a converted wire factory, bu
t we made ammunition. I -- I made 
hulls for bullets. And it worked in a drum, a
nd e very so often a bullet would get stuck, you know 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
62 
 
 
a hull would get stuck, and I would let the machine run. That was my cont
ribution to -- but you 
had to be careful, because the guard would hear
 it if she was close by, so you had to be  very 
careful. But that was a -- it was li
ke an achieveme nt. So anyway -- 
Q: So just to go back, so we™re sort of finish
ing up when you were at Auschwitz, did you witness 
or have anything to do with a
ny resistance activities there? 
A: No, no. We just had to stand once, I 
don™t know for how ma ny hours because some body 
escaped. And they brought him back and they put 
-- they ha -- they put him in a bunker. Meaning 
a bunker was like y-you couldn™t sit, 
stand straight for -- I mean, I don™t know, I -- that™s what I 
was told, that you could not sta
nd straight. And we had to sta
nd appelle. And then once they 
hung some body in front of everybody to show them
 what happened when you escape. That was 
my whole --  

Q: Do you think you saw these things and reacted 
emotionally, or do you think you were shutting 

down your emotions a lot of the time? 
A: I think we  shut it down. You just shut 
off, because you cou -- you -- you had to. You know, 
you -- if you wanted to survive, you could not -- 
you couldn™t -- you -- you just couldn™t wallow 
-- you couldn™t be -- wallop in it, you couldn™t -- 
and you could not come  back to -- to a norma l 
life if you would. I don™t think so. 

Q: Do you have any sense if most of t he othe
rs around you were reacting 
similarly?  Di d you talk 
with others about th
is sort of thing? 
A: You know, I have very little contact with pe ople who -- I-I just hear, okay?  Debbie has a 

friend, it was -- it™s -- oh, and his parents are surv
ivors, and he looked at 
me , and he s a id, ﬁHow 
come you™re so normal? ﬂ I didn't -- I really did not 
-- I di -- I -- so his 
wife to -- I don™t know if 
it™s his wi -- it -- both parents, 
I -- I really -- and she said, ﬁI wa
nt you to meet my mother.ﬂ And I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
63 
 
 
said to Debbie, ﬁDebbie, this is not -- I™m not 
doing this, you know?  I -- I d
on™t want to be rude, 
but at the same  token,ﬂ I said, 
ﬁI don™t need this.ﬂ So -- 
Q: Do you fi nd it at all difficult, fo
r instance in this interview -- 
A: No. 
Q: -- bringing back all the me mories? 

A: No, no, no. It™s been si -- it -- 
i -- it™s part of life which I co
uld have lived without, we could 
all have lived without, but you can™t
 -- you can™t change it. It™s b
een, and I -- you can™t let it take 
hold of you. It™s been, it™s like when some body 
pa -- dies -- when some body passes away. I 
mean, it™s not fun to have lost my husband, but th
at™s life. He lived a go
od life, he enjoyed his 
children, he enjoyed his fa mily, that™s it. Mayb
ecamp made me like that
, I don™t know. I really 
don™t. Some times I think there™s something wrong with
 me . I really do. But, as I said, that was -- 
my thing was that I did not want to mutilate my 
children, because I have seen people do it. I have 
-- I have a fri end who has -- was not in camp, whole family survived, and she mutilated her 
children. For no reaso -- 
you know, it™s for no reason at all. She has a tremendous a mount of 
hatred towards the church, towards the peopl
e. You know, you -- you can™t -- not everybody is 
responsible, you can™t ma ke everybo
dy responsible. Sure, they -- it
 -- it didn™t need to be, but 
there was nobody to stop it.  
Q: Do you feel hatred some  of the time ?  

A: No, really not, really not. It™s a -- whom do you hate?  You 
hate a phantom. You ca n™t -- you 
can only hate when you hate one person, okay?  So
 you™re not really -- 
you can™t -- you can™t 
ma ke everybody responsible, though they were, th
e great majority of the people were, okay, but 
that -- that™s the way it was. That™s the way 
it is, right? We  haven™t learned. And of c ourse, 
because it wa s only Jews, nobody was really intere
sted in helping. I mean, we thought America 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
64 
 
 
was the great -- the -- the greatest th-thing God 
every created, right? But as -- as -- as you go 
along, there is -- there is -- it™s
 still better than any other 
place. So, that™s it, right? 
Q: So, now when you leave Auschwitz, can you te
ll me  -- you started to tell me  before -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- also tell me  what happened at this 
point wi th Marianne. Sh
e did not go with you? 
A: She -- Marianne stayed in Auschwitz, in 
poy -- in Birkenau, okay. She was liberated by the 
Russians in January, we were liberated in Ma
y. I think she we nt to -- she went in the 
[indecipherable] I believe it was, she told me , to
 Romania. And from there she went -- I don™t 
know, to Vienna, I believe, or to Italy. I really 
don™t know because her si
ster was in Italy, her 
brother was in Venezuela.. So I -- 
that -- I -- I really 
don™t know. I found my 
-- I -- I knew a sold 
-- an American soldier, Jewish and he went to 
Vienna, and I ask him to go to the Jewish agency 

to find if my  -- if -- who is al
ive and who isn™t. And I gave him the name s  and among them he 
found Mariani. And she wa -- at -- 
in the time  I think -- I believe 
she was a nurse in the Jewish 
hospital there. And so he told her that I was a
live in Linz. I could not come  down because the ru 
-- there was the Russian zone in between. Andfinally I borrowed an I.
D. card and I took the 
train, and I ba -- and I got through. And the Russi
an -- you know, the Russians were comi ng into 
the play -- the train and look for 
I.D. cards. The als -- the other da
nger was if they liked you they 
can take you out. So here we were, okay. So we we
nt -- so I we nt and I went with another girl, 
and I get to the street where Mari
ani lives, it™s about 11 
o™clock at night. And of course after a 
certain time  the doors are locked, and we -- you know
, you have to ring for the super. And here I 
hear footsteps on the cobblestone s. There were 
two Russian soldiers comi ng down. And this was 
an encounter you really weren™t 
looking for. So -- but finally 
what happened was I had pennies, 
and I so -- and I saw -- and I saw a light in 
the window. And I knew what floor she was on, but I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
65 
 
 
didn™t know if it was her window. 
And suddenly she passed her window, so here I am t hrowing 
the pennies, and she finally realized, you know
?  So she came  -- she opened up and she came 
down just before they -- before those Russian 
came  up, and I  -- that™s ho
w I me  -- that™s how I 
met and saw Mariani the first time. 
Q: Wa s it a very nice reunion? 

A: Yes, yes, that was a good reunion. And th-t
his other lady who used to live with us, she 

survived, too. And her mother surviv
ed, that was interesting. And they
 were -- she -- at that time  
she must have been in -- in her 80™s and the husband was in her 90™s. The father, I think, died. 

But the mother survived. [indecipherable] 

Q: What™s -- what™s her name? 

A: Biamgauten. 

Q: And -- and when was she with you? 

A: She -- when we lived in th
e -- in the storefront, so -- 
Q: Now whe n you -- so take me  back to when you leave -- 

A: Auschwitz? 

Q: -- Auschwitz. When was this and tell me  about this next journey. 

A: In October ™44, we were transported by cattle
 car, and it wa s up nor --
 up in -- in northern 
Germany, it was -- so they -- they pitched three circus tents, huge, enormo us.  

Q: All right, just to continue where we left o
ff, you were telling me  about tents that were put up. 
A: Yes, the tents. 

Q: And -- and where,
 exactly, is this? 
A: I don™t know. 
End of Tape Three, Side A 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509

Beginning Ta pe Three, Si de B 
Q: This is a continuation of a United States 
Holoca ust Memorial Museum interview with Ann 
Green. This is tape number three, side B. Oka
y, continue -- you were telling me  about a storm. 
A: It was a terrible storm, and the 
tent we were in collapsed. Now,
 we were just sitting on straw, 
I don™t know how ma ny hundreds of pe
ople in one tent, and it was te
rrible. And from there they 
moved us to Bergen-Belsen for a very short ti
me . I couldn™t tell you if it was a week, or two 
weeks, but our transport went to Salzwedel in
to an ammunition factor
y. And there -- that was 
from October to May, when I was liberated. 
Q: Now at Bergen-Belsen, were you telling me  
some thing about Anne Frank while you were 

there? 

A: I an -- I heard only re
cently that she was on a transport wh
ere they housed them in huge tents 
before getting to Bergen-Belsen, so
 I said that that mu
st have been the transport. In Bergen-
Belsen, be -- that was in the very, very beginni
ng of Bergen-Belsen, I tho 
-- because there were 
just barracks there, we didn™t do anything, we ju
st sat around all day long,
 and -- until we were 
transpor ted to the factory. And there we worked 
two weeks day shift, two weeks night shift. As 
soon as the body got accustome d to -- to day shift,
 we went to night sh
ift and the other way 
around. But there we were only ma ybe eight or 
10 girls in one room, and we had a -- was 
wintertime and we had a stove there which came in very handy because we  used to wet the 

seams of our  clothes and put them 
up against -- on the stove pipe, to 
steam it, to ki ll the fl  -- to 
kill the lice.  

Q: That seems very resourceful. 

A: We ll, that™s all we had. That and DDT. And - -
 a-and we worked. We  left in the morning and 
came hom --  and then that was really almost 
if you can call it luxury because we had a purp -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
67 
 
 
you know, we were indoors. The only scary part th
ere was apparently they 
knew that that was in 
effec -- there were als -- there 
were also French prisoner of 
war camps around there, and they 
didn't bomb us, but we -- th -- we mo  -- they move
d us into the -- into the place where they kept 
the ammunition. It wasn™t very se
cure feeling, it wasn™t, because 
we -- we were right there, the 
whole thi -- if they would have
 ever bombed it, the whole thing would have gone up. But they 
never bombed there. They flew over, but they never bombed. 
Q: What did you know about the war at this stage? 

A: We  -- we -- we didn™t -- we knew it wasn
™t going well because there was one elderly 
gentlema n there who befriended one of the pris
oners who was -- she converted from ju -- to 
Christianity and he was ma rried
 to a Christian. And he contac
ted her husband and he was the 
person who would always tell us, you know, it™sgoing good, or it™s going bad, or whatever. So 

there we had some  se mbl a nce of knowledge at the time. But unfortunately some body reported 

him, and I don™t -- he -- they jailed him. I hope
 he -- you know, he was a real nice old gentlema n. 
Q: Did you rema in optimistic during this time? 

A: We  were always optimistic. We  had to be. If 
you wanted -- if you -- you tried to survive, and 
the only way to survive was to be optimistic that
 some -- something will --  Americans are wi --  
go -- Americans are going to come , they™re goi
ng to -- the war is going to be over. 

Q: Wa s it only other wome
n working at this camp? 
A: Yeah, just wome n. Was just -- yeah, there 
were just wome n. We  had the -- the German 
supervisors, you know, people who used to work in 
the factory before were supervisors, and of 
course we had the guards. 

Q: How did they treat you? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
68 
 
 
A: There was no friction there. Th
ere was no friction there. I mea
n, I was told once -- I had -- I 
mu -- I don™t know what I did, I -- pr
obably I let that thing run, and 
she told me  that if I don™t -- 
if I keep it up I won™t be around long, so I was very careful. 
Q: But on a daily basis -- 

A: Yeah, no, th -- on the daily, you worked, 
you -- no, you worked you -- you had your -- your 
lunch period, your -- you -- you were treated like
 a moral -- I mean, you were a prisoner, but you 

were treated like a worker. So -- 

Q: And that™s considered
 a slave labor camp, right? 
A: Yeah, that was slave la -- I mean, it was all slave labor. 

Q: Do you receive reparations for having worked
 there? Or do you receive, you know, restitution 
money?  

A: No, I don™t get -- no, I don™t get 
anything from Germany, I have a 
-- I have a disability from 
Austria and I get Social Security from Austri
a because I -- because you know, I -- I never -- I 
never worked legally in Austria but they give me
 Social Security. What 
is it, I think 300 some  
odd dollars a month. And -- and when th -- when they
 first started to give
 ref -- reparation, I was 
going to send it back, I was so in -- I was so -- r
eally, I was so upset, I said I™m sending it ma -- I 
think it was 500 dollars or some thing, and I was 
going to go and send it back and they said, you 

stupid?   

Q: Now -- excuse me, I was reading -- I was readi
ng in a survivor™s me mo
ir about Salzwedel -- 
A: Mm-h m.  

Q: -- and read an interesting story about the 
water faucets in the camp, and I was wondering if 
you knew anything about this. She wrote that the 
water faucets in the camp were wired with 
bombs. Had you ever hear
d anything about that? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
69 
 
 
A: No, no, that I have never -- I mean saw 
-- Salzwedel was a -- I mean, was luxury. We -- I 
mean, we worked. We  were -- the f -- the food wa
sn™t food, but it was wi  -- compared to -- to -- 
to Auschwitz it was, you know. We
 were laborers, so they kn
ew enough to give wa -- you know, 
we -- it was only soup also, but it was more a -- you 
know, we were laborers, they needed us at 
that point. 
Q: Was it diffi cult work? 

A: No, I mean, I just mo nitored a ma chine. The machine did the work. You know, all they did 

was ma ke the -- they stamped the hulls. So
me  people probably had more, you know, heavier 
work, I was just lucky to get this machine.  

Q: And was it -- you said it was only wome n, wa
s  it also only Jewish women in this camp? 
A: I think so. I think so. Because when we woul
d -- u-unless they came fr om other places too, I 

really couldn™t say that for -- the people I 
knew, you know, only the supervisors were old wor -- 

you know, the workforce from before. 
Q: And wha t  about routines like there was 
also appelle and roll call at this camp?  
A: I don™t think so. I th -- no, we just came ho
me , washed, went for food, went back. No, I don™t 
think so. I don™t believe so. Maybe they count
ed as we lined up fo
r food, I really don™t 
reme mber, but I really d
on™t think so. I cannot reme mber having 
to get up and standing outside.  
Q: And now we get to the time of liberation, so tell me  a little bit more. I know you -- also you 
already me ntioned people, the wome n, flooding th
e gate. But what else are your impressions? 

A: What do you mean flooding the gate? 

Q: Oh -- 

A: Oh yeah, going out 

Q: Rushing to the gate. What ot
her first impressions do you have? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
70 
 
 
A: My first impression was that we had -- all th
e guards from the other camps came  to our camp. 
They tore off their insignia and they also ha
d prisoners come  from other camps, they brought 
them down, but they themselves tore off all thei
r insignia on their clothe
s. And I have to say 
Americans treated them with kid gloves. I -- it 
wa s absolutely revolting to watch. Revolting in a 
way, in another way admi rable, because the on
ly -- wa -- the only incident happened, the cook, 
who was a German sol dier, ran, and the guy in the tu
rret shot him, and they let him lay there for I 
don™t know how ma ny, a couple of da
ys. But that was the only -- 
how shall I -- incident which 
was -- that you say was any type of -- can™t sa
y cruel, what happened. 
But the -- the -- the camp 
commander, everybody was treated, it was just abso
lutely disgusting to watch. I mean, I didn™t 
me  -- y-you know, they weren't always -- they were --
 weren't even treated as -- as -- as pris -- as 
prisoners or anything. They were 
just handled with such -- almo
st they were guests. It was 
disgusting to watch. 
Q: And did they stay there, or did 
they just walk fr ee, and walk out? 
A: No, no, no, no. They -- they -- they were -- but th
ey were -- it -- it was 
done in such a laissez-
faire way, you know?  And of course there were 
some th -- you know, were peop -- jewi -- some  
of the prisoners who were in the office in work, th
ey spoke for them and told them that they were 
ma rvelous and whatever else. I mean, we we
ren™t mi streated, don™t mi sunderstand. I mean, it 

was -- it was total luxury compared to before. 
So that -- that was interesting and I wa -- 
some thing very funny happened. As the troops we
re going through, I said it was so American. I 
mean, they were young kids, you know, it was th -- pr
actic -- the end of the war, and they must 
have got -- found food in far ms or wherever, wh
atever they, you know, collected. They u -- they 
threw eggs, cartons of eggs at us, we  should catc
h them. As the trucks were -- they we re going 
very slow, I have to say, but as they were
 moving through, they were throwing eggs.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
71 
 
 
Q: Did a lot of eggs break? 
A: All of them broke. And then they fe d us and they ma de chicken soup with rice. And it was 

more fat than soup, and I would say99 percent the peopl
e got jaundiced.  
Q: How about you, how was your health? 

A: And I didn™t, because I didn™t eat.
 I was -- I was so sick that  I --
 I ca  -- I mean, I was afraid to 
take anything in. So you walked around, everybody 
was yellow. It was -- it was funny. It wasn™t 
funny, but it was funny. And -- and it took me  
awhile to go out. I waited until you -- you know 
the -- the flow stopped, and then I we
nt out, but I had no place to go.  
Q: And whe n you went out, that was the last time  you saw that place, you just left?  Or did you 

come back?  

A: I -- you know, no, they transported us onto an
 Air Force base, and we stayed there for a 
couple of -- you know, time is very difficult to
 reme mber. I don™t know 
if it was weeks or 
months. And th -- and I was with Hungarian girls th
ere, and -- and we went
 to ha -- we go -- we 
started to work at the British office
r™s home, kee ping house [indecipherable] 
Q: Where wa -- where was this? 

A: In Hanover. And from there I tried to ge
t back to Vienna. You know, wh-when everything 

calme d. And one day there was a bus going, and I t
ook it. And I ended up in Linz and I couldn™t 
go any further because there was the Russian zone  in between. So I looked for a place to stay. I 

was with two other girls. And I 
found a -- I found a room, and I f
ound it -- and I looked for a job. 
And I worked for the civil censor, which -- there was a -- the amer -- an -- a unit there which was 

all -- well, most of them -- most of them spoke
 German, and a lot of them were -- and one of 
them were Jewish. And I ca -- I got the job there, 
and I was able to rent a -- the room, and I met a 
young ma n and a bi -- he -- and he said to me
, what are you going to 
do here, you know. And I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
72 
 
 
had a cou -- I have a cou -- I have a cousin in Is
rael and he asked me  if 
I wanted to come  live on 
a kibbutz. And that™s the one thing I could not 
-- I couldn™t even imagin
e, living with people. 
That™s the one thing I ga -- you kno
w, I -- I just couldn't -- so I di
dn't want to go. And he said to 
me , what are you going to do here, you know. So 
I said, well I don™t know, you know, I will see. 
Go back [indecipherable] eventually I get back to
 Vienna. And he says, would you really want to 
live here?  So I said, I do
n™t know. So anyway, he wrote to his 
brother. I reme mbered my mother 
-- my father™s sister, her husband came  here, a
nd I reme mbe r ed the address of the brother he 
went to stay with in Brookl
yn, Stillwell Avenue, and I knew th
e -- I reme mbered the number, 
don™t ask me today. I reme mbered the number, and 
I knew it was Stillwell Avenue and it wa -- I 
knew it was Brooklyn, and I knew he had a plumbing 
business. So anyway, this friend of mi ne, 
Paul, wrote to his brother, and hi
s brother put an ad in the paper to look for him -- in Aufbau, the 
-- the Germa n refugee paper. And he, in turn, looked for my -- for my
 unc le, and he in turn got in 
touch with my mother™s uncle w
ho eventual -- whose -- whose in-laws eventually sent me a visa, 
and I came here on the second boat 
crossing the -- crossing over.  
Q: Now whe n was that and where did you leave from?  
A: I left from Ha mburg. I -- what happened is
 I worked, okay, and I went on vacation. And I got 
a call from my landlady that the American embassy
 is looking for me . And so I went -- got on 
the train and I went back and I contacted them, a
nd they wanted -- you know, they told me  that I 
have a visa to go, and they ma de an appointme nt
 for an examination, a
nd I was lucky because I 
had silicosis, which I didn't  know. Wek -- you kn
ow, I didn™t know, I was -- I gained wek -- from 
70 pounds I went to 150 so I was roly-poly, you 
know. I didn't look sick, nothing hurt me . S -- 
and I reme mber the nurse at the embassy, she li
stened and she listened 
and she listened, and -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
73 
 
 
but eventually she let me  go. S -- and I only found 
out when I came to the States, almo st a year 
later, that  that™s what it was.  
Q: How did you find out a year later? 

A: How?  I was treated for -- they treated -- a 
year later they treated me  for TB. And sputum, 
everything was negative, but I 
was [indecipherable] they didn
™t know, took x-rays, they see 
spots. So I stayed in bed. First I stayed in bed 
for six months, that didn™t help because I was do -- 
what happened was, when I weighed -- I m
ean, I came here, I weighed 150 pounds, you know?  I 
had a friend, a school friend from Vi enna, and sh
e was beautiful, she was tall, slim, bl onde. She 
looked at me  and she said, nobody in America wa
lks around like this. So what™d she do, she 
takes me  to a European doctor, a woma n. And sh
e gave me  ups, downs, ons and overs. Pills. I 
went down to 113 pounds, and I started coughing. So I ha
d to -- I went to the doctor, so they took 
an x -- they -- no, he sent -- so I 
went to the doctor and 
he said I have to go
 to a rest home . And 
he sent me up someplace close to Monticello a
nd I was -- I was the -- I was the youngest person 
there, everybody was recuperati
ng, it was -- it -- it was from the workma n™s circle. I didn't 
belong. Wh y -- how I got there, I don™t know. A
nd the nurse there said everybody should have 
an x-ray. So I said, okay, I have an x-ray, I -- 
I had nothing to do. Took an x-ray. She brings it -- 
Liberty was a big TV -- TB center. And the docto
r looks at it, and he 
said, put her into the 
pavilion. They had a t -- a TB pavilion up there.
 And I picked up the phone and I called my 
husband, I said, can you pick me  up? He said, no I 
can™t, so I said, I™m taking the bus. And I took 
the bus back to New York, and I went to my docto
r and of course they treated me  for TB. Then, 
at the time, streptomycin came out, which was a ve
ry dangerous drug, and I 
-- they gave it to me, 
that was four injections a day fo
r a week, three, two, and then one for two weeks. I got that three 
times. Nothing changed. So, after six months, 
finally they decided I should go see somebody 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
74 
 
 
else. And the woma n worked for th
e city, and she says she wo -- 
she happened to be Vi ennese, 
and she said to me , get up, lead a normal life, and 
wait. I did that. And then I went to the Vincent 
Aster diagnostic center. I don™t kno
w if this still exists, but y
ou -- you -- it™s -- you pay, but you 
get a specialist assigned to you, and I was lucky, 
and the ma n wrote his thesis on silicosis. And 
he ada -- he diagnosed me  and 
that was it, and he said, so a
nd so ma ny per centage die, some body 
-- some  recover some what and some  recover. A
nd that was it. And I thought -- and then -- and 
that was it. 
Q: This was sort of a ma jor health issu
e that kept following you around after the war. 

A: In fact, in fact, some body started a class acti
on suit. I didn't even know about it. One day I got 
a letter that whoever produced the drug, I can™t 
reme mber any more, I will
 get a check because -- 
I didn™t do anything. They must have -- I don™t
 know how it works, but apparently every 
drugstore knew at the time  what drugs were admini
stered to whom, so they found out that I got it 
too. I think that -- I think it was a thousand dollars
 or something, at the time it was like I didn™t 
know where it came from. But that was it. 

Q: Now, to go back, I mean how was your health 
in the immediate afterm
ath of being liberated? 
Were you able to rebound fairly quickly? 

A: Yeah, I rebound, I rebound, and I was careful, of 
course, right away what I was eating, and I 
probably went to a doctor or some thing. That I ca
n™t even remember any more. But apparently it 
went away, and I started to gain weight and I went back up to 150 pounds. 

Q: And at liberation, can you describe some  part 
of the feeling, and also 
the feeling of others 
around you. Were people emotional?  Did you feel emotional? 

A: Yes, but you know what?  He -- it was so -- 
some thing so totally -- you couldn™t comprehend 
it. You know, everybody was pushing out, and I was in
 the mi ddle, and -- and I just stopped -- I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
75 
 
 
didn't wa -- you know, I just stood there and let everybody else pass me  because I was so 
overwhelmed. Ye -- it -- it was something you were 
waiting for, and when it happened, you were 
like stunned. It was some thing 
you couldn™t -- I -- I don™
t know why I wa nted to go back. It was 
just a reaction I had. Probably security. Because 
here I was in no man™s land. I mean, I -- I didn™t 
know the town.  

Q: I read in this other survivor™s me moir that in
 the town there were depa
rtme nt stores, and that 
some  of the prisoners -- the wome n fr om Salz
wedel, from the camp, were going into the town. 
A: Yeah, yeah -- 

Q: Did you see this, or part of -- 

A: -- I sa w that, I saw re -- soldiers doing it.
 I saw people doing it. It
™s not my -- it™s --  
Q: Did you go as well? 

A: No. It™s not my te mpe r ament, you know?  I ti -- so
mehow or other I -- I -- it™s not me. Yeah, I 
saw that, yeah. This is the like the gurd -- th
-the -- the -- the blockom
a who knocked the kid off 
the bike for no reason at all, 
because what™s she going to do 
with the bike? You know?  I me an, 
what that little kid ever do to her?  So, I m
ean -- if she would have [indecipherable] confront 
some body, a dult or some thing, you know, but to knock the -- I me an, she literally knocked the -- 

I see her in fr ont of me . And of course I had no 
use for her to start off. You know, so -- no, that™s 
-- yeah, that™s the -- th
e -- I -- I would watch th
e soldiers go into apartme nts. You know, once we 
walked on the street, and I would watch, but th --
 I™d -- how shall I say?
 I had no n -- I shouldn™t 
say I had no need to -- what -- wha -- what 
could you get?  I me an, you go in, what do you take?  

You know, I mean, why? So I -- I 
-- th-that wasn™t my thing. I mean, I wa -- it just -- I -- I 
couldn™t do it. 

Q: We re you talking with the Amer
ican soldiers who liberated you? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
76 
 
 
A: No, because they weren't -- th-they were stri 
-- it was strictly -- there was a war going. I mean, 
they was going to the -- to 
take the next
 tow -- town. 
Q: So they kept moving? 
A: They kept moving. I mean, there was some  le
ft behind, okay, who -- th
e admi nistration, but -- 
but that was it, you know. And as I said, basi
cally how -- how we got
 to Hanover I cannot 
reme mber. That -- the reason, how they m
oved us, all I know is we got there.  
Q: And is there a point where you really felt fi
na lly free? Was that still at Salzwedel, or a -- 
later?  

A: You -- you feel free, but you have  no place to
 g -- you don™t belong, you have no place to go. 
What next?  You were still -- you lived -- you still 
lived with 20 girls. You still -- your food was 
still given to you. There wasn™t -- really 
no norma lcy. I mean, to -- you know, and you didn™t 
know when it™s going to be and how 
it™s going to be. To me  it was st
rictly that I was trying to get 
back to Vienna. I couldn™t, so I ha
d to start in Linz, where I was. 
Q: When™s the first time you felt a more normal life again? 

A: When I had a -- when I had a room. When I 
had a room to myself. And it -- you know, and 
they -- si -- it -- si -- since 
there was occupation, it was still not 
-- it was a sti -- it still wasn™t 
normal. 

Q: That™s in Linz? 

A: I™m sorry? 

Q: Is that when you -- 

A: In Linz? 

Q: -- you were -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
77 
 
 
A: Yeah, that was in Linz , because our associ
ation mostly was with -- it wasn™t with the 
population because if you li -- if you believe  it or
 not, you were still the 
Jew. And, you know, the 
two other girls, one Jewish, I don™t know where 
I picked them up, but they weren™t Jewish. But 
we had nothing in -- you had nothing
 in common with the population. 
Q: Did you still feel some anti-Semitism at that time there? 
A: Oh yeah, of course. You go back you feel
 it now, you have it now. You know, I mean, the 
Austrians are -- they were victims, they di -- were
 not -- believe me , I me an, they were definitely 
victims. So - -  I mean, this is why when I covere
d my number, I said I™m not going to give her the 
satisfaction, no way. 

Q: So now you™re in Li nz  for awhile, and then 
you were telling me  about -- it™s the person there 

who contacted -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- the person in the U.S. -- 
A: Right. 
Q: -- your -- your fa mily me mber. But tell me  about
 the rest of your journe
y within Austria from 
Linz. Cause you went back to Vienna
, is that right?  When was that? 
A: Yeah, we went -- but I -- I ne
ver settled there. You know, I vi
sited Mariani, I stayed with 
Mariani and I went back to Linz. And she was in
 -- she was in Vienna. I mean, she weve -- she 
from -- I think from Aus c hwitz, she™d been to Ro
mania, or Bulgaria, I don™t remembe r  any more. 
And she came back, but I never went back to ve 
-- I mean, I went back, but I was ra -- I had a 
room. I rented a room, I worked. And -- and I -- 
a-and really didn™t know 
at -- I really had no -- 
no plans, I -- I wasn™t re
ally thinking. I-It was like 
empty. And -- and that™s it. 
Q: Did you look for fa mi ly in Vienna? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509

A: Oh yeah, that -- no, that -- you know, that wa
s already -- that was already in 1945, okay, so 
definitely I mean, but nobody came back. In fact, 
my -- my father™s two uncles -- two brothers 
weren™t even back then, and they came  back mu c
h, much later. In fact, they came back -- I mean, 
I was here already and I -- I found out from my co
usin in Israel that her father and his brother 
came back, but they were, at that point, they 
w -- I -- you know, it™s so very difficult, when 
you™re young, everybody at a certain 
age is old. So I have no refe
rence to think how old they 
were. So -- 

Q: When you visited Vienna like 
this, did you have any desire to
 return there and live there? 
A: If the family would have been there, or if 
I would have seen some  reason to go there. But at 
that point I already --

Beginning Ta pe Four, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of a United States 
Holoca ust Memorial Museum interview with Ann 
Green. This is tape number four, 
side A. So you were saying about 
the idea of perhaps living in 
Vienna again after the wa r? 
A: I na -- I don™t know if I ente
rtained the thou -- th
e thought. The problem was to -- to -- to 
establish yourself, to have a -- 
I -- I was not -- I had no schooli
ng, I had no -- I -- I trained as a 
millinery, okay, for a-awhile. At one point when my
 father was thinking of mi c -- leaving, there 
was a woma n, she gave courses in mil --  fr om -- 
in milliner y, so I was sent  ther e and I did that . 

So f-for me t -- t -- job, you know, 
job-wise was a -- some thing I really didn™t -- at the -- at the 
time I don™t think I -- I was th -- I was -- was 
thinking anything through or planning. You know, 
you never planned for so ma ny years, so planni
ng was not some thing you easily did. You just 
like, wherever you fell, that™s
 where -- wherever you landed. 
Q: I know we™ve talked about your emotions th
roughout this period. What
 were your emotions 
like when you realized your fa mily me
mbers weren™t comi ng back to Vienna? 
A: I was happy to see Mariani, but that was a
bout -- I had no aba -- and gi
 -- at that poin -- you 
know, I think the camp does some thing to you. And 
I had really no -- you know, you lived from -

- from mi nut e to mi nute, from hour to hour, so yo
u were really not -- there was not this much 
emotion, you know, there was no -- you -- I mean, youdid not -- you -- you -- you -- it wasn™t a 

psychologically normal situation. And regardlessof whatever, I suppose, subconsciously that™s 

what happened.  

Q: So would you say you, unfortunately you weren't 
very surprised that your fa mily members 
didn't return to Vienna?  Was that a shock for you at that time ? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
80 
 
 
A: Not a sho -- it -- it -- it was 
a -- it was -- it™s not a shock, you 
can™t say it™s a shock, because it 
was a -- a wa y of -- i-it was an ex -- i-it wasn™t 
an expectation. You had to hope that they would 
return, but it was hope against hope, b
ecause that was not the situation. 
Q: It™s like you had to prepare yourself for so long that -- me ntal
ly that they wouldn™t return. 
A: Right, because I mean nobody knew that you™
re going to survive. You hoped you would 
survive. The last thing wa s we -- everybody will co
me  back, and that™s it. But when -- when you 
realize the full -- the -- the com -- you know, wh
at happened, you don™t -- you -- you realize that 
that™s -- that™s par -- that was part
 of the situation and that™s it.  
Q: When did it sink in for you actually, the 
ma gnitude of what had happened during the 
Holocaust? 

A: You -- when the realization, wh -- when you -- when you saw the whole thing, when you 

realized the whole thing. And of
 course part you knew, I me a n 
when you saw the -- the -- the -- 
the s --  
Q: Crematorium?  
A: -- the crematorium, when you saw the smoke
 and the smell, you knew what was going on, so 
you were almost prepared for it, because it 
was -- you know, you -- there were people even in 
camp that yo -- the underground worked. And this
 one was working here, and this one was 
working there, and people were 
telling stories, so you had -- and 
-- and -- I see -- when you see 
the smoke and the smell, you -- you real -- you reali
ze. And then finally you also realize that 
when you go into the shower that 
you never know if you™re going to 
come  out or not. So that was 
a -- you walk in, okay, you don™t know what is comi
ng. So this is a situation which is -- which 
nobody can comprehend. 

Q: Did you think very much about death during those days? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
81 
 
 
A: No, because we -- be -- you gonna s -- you gonna 
survive because if you don™t feel that you™re 
going to survive, you™re not -- you know, it™s --
 you can™t -- you just wouldn™t be able to 
function. I mean, you walked the -- you -- you had 
-- you had no control. You walked in. Is the 
water going to come , or is the gas going to 
come? Everybody knew at that point because we 

were there long enough to know. You walked out, you 
were lucky. Next time , that™s it. So --  
Q: Did you -- 

A: -- I wonder what the kids are go
ing to say when they hear this. 
Q: I think it™s -- it™s -- it™s good 
that you™ve been very open. I real
ly appreciate that, and -- and 
I™m sure your fa mily will, too. But I wanted to 
ask you, did you ever re-establish contact with the 

people -- any of the peopl
e who hid you in Vienna? 

A: I tried to. We  -- when we went back -- no, I wa
s in contact with the -- 
with the friends of my 
father, I was in contact [indecipherable] for awhi
le. I™m a terrible, terrible -- I hate to write 
letters. I think -- am I analyzing myself?  It -- it™s
 something -- a letter to 
me is a perma nent thing, 
and I just hate to write letters. 
I really do. I™m a talker, I™m on th
e phone, I hate to write letters. 
Q: You don™t like the perm
anency of the letter? 
A: I don™t know what I don™t like. I just
 don™t like writing 
letters, and I -- 
Q: And it doesn™t ma tter what language?  It™s not 
just that -- writing in English or a second 
language -- 

A: No, no, no, has nothing to do with this, absolutely
 nothing to do with it.
 I -- I can labor over a 
-- a sympathy card, a get well card. Okay? I mea
n, it™s the most idiotic thing ther e is.  
Q: So -- so you did have some  ki
nd of contact, but not -- not -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
82 
 
 
A: Oh yes, I had contact with them, and I send th
em things and all. And then when we went to 
Austria, we stopped where the 
do -- where their daughter lived, 
and I rang her bell. It was 
lunchtime, but she never answ
ered, so I never saw her. 
Q: Whose daughter? 
A: The friends of my parents. And th-the
y had a daughter who was ma rried, and sum -- 
Summering, that™s a resort, and she 
lived there and she had a little st
ore, I can™t reme mber what it 
was. And I know she was ma rried there and she divor
ced, and sh -- but she st
ayed there, and I ca 
-- I found out where she lives, and I ca -- went
 to the house and I rang 
her bell and she never 
answered the bell, so I walked away. 

Q: And did you ever hear of, or have 
contact with M-Ms. Pukas, who hid you? 
A: No, with her I had no contact at all, none at all.
 When we went back, we stay -- we stayed in a 
hotel around the corner where I was -- where we
 were hiding. In fact
, the window looked down 
on the place, but it -- they tore 
everything down, so it didn™t look fa
miliar at all. It -- it was the 
weirdest, weirdest -- and so then 
I wa -- when I realized where I was, I went ther e, and those -- I 
tried to see the people who lived in the -- in 
the building next door -- it was an apartme nt house 

next door, out of bricks. And nobody was home
, so I couldn™t speak to anybody. But -- 
Q: So then we get to the point where you 
get the news that you can go to the U.S..  
A: Right. 

Q: Tell me a little bit more a
bout the journey and arriving. 
A: We ll, the journey was we was se -- I was se
nt  to a camp in Munich, a displaced pe rson camp 
where they gathered all the people. 

Q: Do you know the name  of that? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
83 
 
 
A: No. And there I ma de friend with a couple of
 people, and we got on the boat. And we came 
here -- 
Q: Do you know when you left?  Wh en 
you left -- you left Hamburg, right? 

A: I left Hamburg in -- it was in
 May. It took 10 days to come  he
re. I think I came here on the 20 
-- no, I got my visa on the 27
th
. It was a -- I still ca -- I came here
 in May. I came here in May, so 
the trip was 10 days. I arrived, and we  arrived like this -- we came on a merchant ma rine. And it 

was six o™clock in the morning, the sun was up, 
and ev -- there were a thousand people on that 
boat, and everybody went to the side of the Statue
 of Liberty. How we didn™t tilt is a mi racle. 
And we had a very interesting 
a -- episode on the pl -- on the --
 on the boat comi ng here. They 
also transported Germans, repa -- repatriates w
ho were American citizens and decided to go back 
in the war to Germany. Well, one of the me n appa -- for whatever reason, jumped off into the 

propeller. And -- course he must have been sm
ithereens. But we had to
 circle, I don™t know for 
how ma ny days, I think it was. Wa s a  -- a -- th
e law that you -- they cannot leave. So I don™t 
know how m -- it was -- I think it wa
s either two days, or -- it wa
s a long time, I mean, that they 
had to circle. Of course they couldn™t find him.
 And I wonder what he di
d that he got scared 
because we were almost here. And then I arri
ved, and I got off the boat, and my two -- my 
mother™s uncle, and my uncle mi ssed me , so -- so they put me  on a -- on a bus, and they brought 

me  to the Ansonia on Broadway and what, 74
th
?  The old Ansonia, I think it 
is a --  it is like a -- an 
apartment building now, it used to be a hotel. And 
I wait -- th-they put me  the end. I had -- they 
contacted my uncle because they were looking for 
me , and so they told them that I was at the 
Ansonia. And you know, by the time  they came from
 the pier, I decided I wasn™t going to hang 
around there, I was going to go look at the neigh
borhood. I mean, I ca me from a big city, I wasn't  
-- I mean, I wasn™t a country bumpkin. And I™m - -
 walk out, and I™m going down to the river, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
84 
 
 
going toward west end. Suddenly this lady, scream
ing and fra ntic. I mean, she was responsible 
for me. 
Q: And how old were you at this time? 

A: I was 20. She is -- you know, she™s where are you going, you know, I [indecipherable] you 

can™t do that. And she held me , and she wasn™t go
ing to let go of me  fo
r the rest -- and then 
finally my uncle and my mother™s uncle came and picked me up. That was my entry to the 

Uni t e d St at es. 

Q: It does seem you have  an adventurous spirit. 

A: Ah, yeah, I suppose so. You know, I was there, there was nothing for me  to do. I wa -- I do 

the -- I did spe -- I spoke -- 

Q: Oh, you already knew English? 

A: Yes, I knew English, but I mean, not to the -- 
to the point that I could converse, you know?  I 
mean, I knew enough to say that I -- don™t worry 
about me, you know, I come from a big city. 
But it was -- I mean, it was funny to me , it wasn™t funny to he -- and -- 

Q: Wa s -- was the whole journey comi ng to the U.S. exciting, or was there, you know -- 

A: It was -- it was -- we -- my -- to us, I -- 
I mean, it was adventure. Everybody was seasick, but 
a few people were -- fe -- few people, among me, 
and we weren™t, so we ate. Th-That ship 
carried enough butter for a 10 day journey. They 
-- the third da y they ran out, because you know, 
that was some thing we did not ha -- people didn™t
 have. So I was introduced to peanut butter, I 
never knew what peanut butter was. So -- yeah. Th-The journey over he
re was adventure.  
Q: And tell me , how wa s, just in
 general, broadly speaking, how 
was the adjustme nt living here 
as a new immi grant, learning more of the language, going to school -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
85 
 
 
A: I -- I stayed with my mother™s uncle, and I 
-- I worked -- I worked where they ma de -- they 
don™t do that any more -- they ma de things for cu
rling your hair out of leather, you -- there was a 
me tal covered with leather and 
you rolled your hair. And we -- I 
did that, and I got a Social 
Security card, okay? And there was a number, so I to
re it up because I wasn™t going to be another 
number. No clue what it wa
s. Just shake your head. 
Q: Well -- 
A: What? 

Q: No, it™s very interesting. I mean, you -- obviou
sly, and that™s some thing I wanted to ask you, 
you know, how do you feel that the 
war time and the Holocaust affected you in the future. I 
mean, there can be countless ways, but are th
ere some  things that you could point to? 
A: No, I c -- I really can™t. 
I ca -- I can™t judge th
at. I can™t judge that. You can judge it. 
Q: We ll, there are things that you
™re obviously aware of. For instance, 
that story to me  says that -
- 
A: You™re stupid -- 
Q: -- because of your -- no, because of your expe
rience at Auschwitz, you didn™t want  to be 
considered a number. 

A: Un-Until today, I can™t reme mber my Social 
Security number. I don™t 
want to. Okay? I t -- 
Q: Are there other obvious things 
like that, that you see 
as sort of the impact of what you went 
through?  

A: Not rea -- no, not really. I mean, this is -- 
this is dumb. I -- it™s almost like a dumb revolt, 

okay?  Me -- I had no clue what the Social Secur
ity number is, I just 
-- I don™t know, what do I 
need it for?  And that was it. That ™s when I told
 the lady that it™s a free 
country, I can -- I can put 
my numb -- my na me  down anyplace. So -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
86 
 
 
Q: Did you feel free once you got to the U.S.? 
A: Yeah, yeah. Beca -- that -- you know, there wa
s no -- y-you also have  to reme mb er I -- you -- 
I had no -- he -- I wasn™t a real teenager because I 
always lived with fear. Not -- not visible, but it 
was always there. You can™t do this
, you can™t do that. You have to 
be careful. So -- and then of 
course once you were marked, that
 was a whole different story, so
 you really couldn™t. And for 
all intents and purposes I was a normal teenager. 
And so probably that had some thing -- so when 
I came here, I was free. And there were some Vie
nnese people living across the street from my 
mother™s uncle and she was just a few years -- 
a year or two older th
an me, and she took me  
under her wing, and we -- you know, she knew people a
nd we were just like other teenagers. We  
weren™t teenagers any more at this point. She to
ok me  to Jones Beach. We  went to Coney Island. 

I was an hour late in comi ng home and my uncle 
was standing on the street with his pocket 
watch, you know. And I said to him -- and he was 
worried about me , and I said, don™t worry, I 
come from a  big city. So I really -- I mean, on
ce I was here, I felt a -- you know, I -- I had people 
to fall back on, and then I started -- I started to 
work as a trimmer in a -- in a millinery factory 

because I had a friend whose parent s had a factor
y -- a hat factory in Vienna, and they were 
working there, so they got me  a job there and I 
worked there. And one day the boss came  and he 
said to me  to do -- to trim two hats. It was al
ready after hour, we had to wait for her husband 
because he ha d to finish some  job to go out. Anyway, he asked me  to do two hats, and she helped 

me  -- for to go to the post office for orders. Next
 thing you know, the sto -- 
the s -- the shops -- th 
-- not the shop steward, whoever is in
 charge of -- okay, came in and 
told me that I did this, that 
and the other, and I can™t do that. And I looke
d at her and I said, ﬁWell why not, you know, I 
wasn™t doing anything,ﬂ I said. ﬁHe asked me  because he wanted it to go out before the post 

office closes.ﬂ So she said to me , ﬁThat was not of your business.ﬂ And from that point on, the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
87 
 
 
union and I don™t work together. Because I co -- I 
-- I couldn™t understand the logic of that whole 
thing. I mean, the order doesn™t go out, you don™t 
get -- don™t get work, you 
sit there and twiddle 
your thumbs . But that was the law. 
Q: How did you meet your husband?  I think th
ere™s a -- a -- a charmi ng story, right? 
A: Yeah. The couple -- you know, 
the people I™m tal -- telling you about, the mother and father 
and her -- their daughter. They 
had a son who was ma rried here and had fa mily here, and I went -
- I was going to Stuyvesant, okay, and I got lost in 
the crossover to take th
e west side train. And 
there was a man comi ng down and 
I ask him how do I get to the west side train?  And he had a 
very heavy Irish accent, and as he
 is talking to me he is walki
ng, and I had no clue what he was 
saying. And Jack came along, and he addressed me  in
 German and he said where I wanted to go. 
So I told him where I wanted to go, so he starts 
telling me  that his family, his grandfather -- oh, 
his father came from a little town
 outside of Austria, close to 
the airport in Vienna. How do you 
meet somebody from that little tow -- from that little
 village, okay?  It got to
 be that man, okay?  It 
had to be the -- the brother of this wo ma n. So -- 
so he want to -- a-and another thing, you have to 
reme mber, Americans couldn™t do no wrong. Th 
-- and you™d spoi -- and also you talked to 
everybody. I me  -- because that is -- was the only 
way of -- there was no ne wspaper, there -- 
communication. Did you -- you were there, did you ev
er meet some body, s o -- so he asked me  if 
I wanted to go for ice cream, so I said sure. A
nd a -- a -- continuously I™m thinking that this is 
this -- this im -- person, you know, because he wa s telling me  about the town and the temple and 

the this and the that. I said, ho-how would you m
eet any other person who comes from that little 
tow -- it™s like a pin in a hays
tack in New York, okay?  And I ne
ver gave it a thought that the guy 
was living in Queens. But that doesn™t mean a
nything, because he could be  in Manhattan. So 
that™s how I me t my hus band. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
88 
 
 
Q: And how long before you were married? 
A: December, six months.  

Q: That™s nice. 

A: So, six months and 60 some  odd years. 

Q: So, I have just a few more questions and I 
think we™re -- we™re almo
s t  done. So, I guess what 
I was tryi ng to ask before -- I -- I -- I™ll say it a sl
ightly different way, see if some thing else mi ght 
come  to mi nd. Just in terms of what the long 
term impact that you feel you can see of the war 
and the Holocaust on your -- perhaps on your decisi
ons -- for instance, you were telling me about 
consciously not wanting to dwell 
on things too much with your 
children. That was a conscious 
decision -- 

A: Right. 

Q: -- of yours. Are there other things, either
 in terms of, you know, your career, work, f -- 
religion, other family issues. Things that you f
eel that the Holocaust 
really affected you, and 
affected your decisions in
 those areas of your life? 
A: I th -- I think the only -- the only thing wh
ich affected me , I would say -- but I would have 
never, ever changed my religion that -- al
though the question -- so ma ybe, you know, more -- 
being more active, rather than
 a -- than m- more -- you know, than just saying yes, I™m Jewish 
and I™m going for Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. But -- 

Q: That because of what you went through you feel more connected? 

A: No, I felt that the children should -- not I.
 I had -- I had my -- I -- I was -- my Jewish 
education so to say, or exposure. But no, for the ch
ildren to know, and as I said, when they were 
old enough, they -- they learned, and 
that was -- always was important
 to me . But I didn™t -- I -- 
they wa -- they -- I di d not want them to -- to feel responsible for -- for what I -- what -- what  ma 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
89 
 
 
-- what I went through, or what 
I experienced. And as 
I said, I did not -- 
De-Debbie went to 
Israel, I remember for -- for -- after high school 
graduation, and there was one week where they 
did nothing. They went -- I don™t know if they 
went on a kibbutz or whatever, it was all 
Holocaust. And she called, and says, ﬁI™m Holocau
sted out.ﬂ So I said, 
ﬁI don™t blame you.ﬂ You 
know, tha -- it was too much, and she was already 18. So
 -- no, I really don™t 
-- I can™t really say 
that -- not mo me ntarily anyway, that 
-- I would have to think about it. 
Q: And the idea that you had to live with a certai
n type of fear or anxiety for so much of your 
youth, when did you feel that you really broke fr
ee of -- of that -- of that situation? 
A: Th -- I -- I -- I si -- there is
 still a c -- a certain respect for au
th-aut hority. I never forget I was 
hailed down by a policeman once who needed to go some place and wanted me  to drive him. And 
when he -- that -- I was here very 
short -- I mean, at -- at -- at -- was -- no, I d -- I didn't  dri -- I 

didn™t drive for -- was -- didn™t drive for a very
 long time. And he flagged me  down, I was in 
absolute -- I broke out in a sweat. And I mean, 
I ne -- I didn't do anything, you know, it -- he just 
said for me  to [indecipherable], just the uniform i n itself. But an -- I hav -- I don™t have that now. 

When they stop me  now it™s for a ticket.  

Q: And I believe your husband was not 
a survivor, he was born in the U.S.? 
A: No, he was born here, right. 

Q: And if you would just tell me , just briefl
y about your friendship with Marianne?  It has 
continued in this country, right? 

A: Yes, yeah, right. I mean, at
 the mome nt if it wouldn™t be 
for us, she wouldn™t have anybody. 
Because for some  [indecipherabl e] whatever reas
on, she has a second cousin who has absolutely 
no interest or whatever, in her. And it™s sad, you know? 

Q: How long have the two 
of you been friends now? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0509  
90 
 
 
A: Well, since I™m -- I™m -- I™m 80 now, and I wa
s 13 then. [indecipherable] ma th?  Right?  That 
says -- 65 years? 

Q: And whe n you spend time with her, do you -- 
the two of you remi nisce about this time?  
A: We -- we can tal -- when we -- it is always that  it is a mi racle that we can -- we will -- we will 

always only pick the fun, okay?  I mean, we 
bo -- about sad, we don™t ha
ve anything to talk 
about. I mean, we laugh about things, okay, whic
h happened, which come  up. Some times they™re 
revelant to so mething and I will say, do you reme
mber?  You know?  So it is not -- ma ybe there™s 
some thing wrong with us. 

Q: Maybe that™s the way you™ve, 
you know, been strong and -- and he
ld things together for so 
long, you know? 

A: I -- I -- I don™t know, I mean
 you can™t -- you can™t say it 
is because I was young, because 
Mariani was older than I am. And then you meet
 people who were -- who just can™t let go, for 

whatever reason. But life goes on.  
Q: But when the two of you get together,you do remi nisce, but often about the -- 
A: No, no the -- I mean, you know, I me -- I mean ther
e were times I used to
 call her every single 
day when she was still -- when she was not -- 
when she could see it, and she was alone, so I 
would call her every single day, and talk to 
her, you know?  And here and there we would, you 
know, laugh about some thing. I mean, she will tell
 -- she will tell you when she bought me  my 

first high heeled shoes and I couldn't walk in. S
o, you know, things like -- we had -- as I said, we 
will say, you know, it™s a mi racle that ha -- al
l things said and done, you live a more or less 
normal life. That™s -- whatever the norm is. 

Q: With a healthy does 
of humor, it sounds like.

A: Yeah. I mean, if you don™t have any -- if you
™re not -- if you don™t have humor then you -- it™s 
-- that is not -- you can™t su
rvive in any situation, you 
know?  So that™s it, right? 
Q: I think that™s -- th
at™s all my questions. Do you have 
anything else you™d like to share? 
A: No, just that I was very lucky that I was 
only in camp for 11 months, a-and ma ybe that is 
what helped me  to survive, because you don™t know what time  would do to you. It™d be much 
more hopeless than -- 
than a short time. 
Q: So I guess you would perhaps take the a
ttitude that even though you got caught while you 
were in hiding, you were fortunate to 
stay in hiding as long as you did? 
A: Definitely, definitely.

Memorial Museum interview with Ann Green. This is
 tape number four, side

ask you if you ever have any dreams, or
 nightma res related to this time ? 

A: No, no, no, never. 

Q: And wha t  about during any of those year
s? During the war time and Auschwitz, and -- 
A: I don™t think so, I don™t know. 
I can™t remembe r . I really can™t reme mbe r . I don™t reme mber 
having nightmares. I really don™t. 

Q: And the way in which you say you don™t want to dwell on the me mories -- 

A: I nev -- I never did, and I -- I 
don™t think that I ever dwelled 
on a day to day basis what is 
going to be tomorrow. Whatev
er was going to be tomorro
w, we face it tomorrow. 

Q: And have you continued that attitude toward life?

A: More or less, yes, mo re or less. Because ther
e is a be -- you know, to look into the future, you 
worry today and tomorrow some thing different. I 
mean, it™s huma n nature, yes, we do worry. I™m 
not saying I™m not worried about ce
rtain things and drive myself 
crazy over nothing. But most of 
the time you were -- you -- you tried not to. 
Even if my children say I™m neurotic. 
Q: We ll, I want to thank you for -- for agreeing to
 be interviewed. Very much appreciate that. 
And now this concludes the United St ates Holo
caust Memorial  Museum interview with Ann 
Green. 

A: Thank you.
