during that time.
  
 
 
W orldW ar II began in September 1939 when Germany attackedPoland.  T he f ollowing 
May, Germ any invaded France.  At that tim e, you were just a year and a half old, so very 
young.  T ellus, to start, what you canabout your parents, their lif e in Paris tothe extent you 
can, their background,recognizing you were so young and there's a lot you don't know.  
W hatever you can share with us.  
 
>> Jacques Fein: W ell, I'll gi ve you a very sh ort answer. T he war started, I was almost 
--
 

slightl y older than 1 year old. I was born in 1938, the war started in1939.  So the truth isI 
rem em ber virtually nothing.  As sim pleas that.  Until
 
--
 
sorry.  Af ter the war started, m y parents 
knew, andParisians knew, and Jews knew especially, lif e was not going to be very good for the 

Jews of  France,and especially the Jews of  Paris.  And thenthrough thehelp of a Jewish

organization called OSE, Oeuvres de Secours aux Enf ants,they put m e in hiding.  I'll let you 
continue.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Jacques, bef orethe war, have you beenabletopiece together anything about 
your parents' lives before they cam e toParis, thef am ily, anything about thef am ily in Poland 
bef ore that?  
 
>> Jacques Fein: Excellent question. I've been trying tof indout. W hat I know f rom  research, 
go i n
g f orward a bit, I still had two cousins who live in Paris, especially m y cousin Sara, who is 
about 8 years older than I am , and rem em bers m uchm ore. So m y parentsf rom Poland lef t in 

the1930s to escapepogrom s in Poland,and they wound up in thepoorer 
section of  Paris.  
T hat's all I know, the f ew things they told me. T hey were poor.  Shewas a housekeeper. They 
did stitching clothing, and that was their life.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Is that how your f ather earned his living, to your best knowledge?  
 
>> J a
cques Fein: To the best of m y knowledge, based upon what Sara
 
--
  
>> Bill Benson: W hatyou learnedf rom  others?
 

>> Jacques Fein:  Right.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Youmentionedthe cousins. T o your knowledge, how lar ge was your extended 

f a m ily?   
 
>> Ja cqu e s 
Fein: That's another good question. In sim pleterm s, I really don't know.  I know 

f rom one of the pictures that you saw, Saraand her cousin are still alive, and they have
 
--
 
each 
are married, andtheyhave kids, Ithinkthree kids, and grandchildren.  So my immediate blood 

fam ily f rom  the war is only two who are alive.

How m any did I have? Off  the topof m y head, I would say easily 20
-
40, but I have no 
idea.  
 
>>
 
Bill Benson:  I know that most of the details about your parentsbeing roundedup, sent to 
cam ps and later deported are unknown to you.  You believe your f ather was taken in 1941, 

possibly in May, and your mother in July of 1942.  Have you beenable to le
arn anything about 
the circum stancesof  yourf atherbeing captured, then sent to cam ps where hemay have been 
sent?  
 
>> Jacques Fein: W hat I learned isf rom  reading history.  So inParis, in terms of the Jews, the 

foreign Jews were f irst taken.  My f ather wasborn inPoland,he was af oreign Jew.  T hey all 
lived in basically the sam e section of Paris, and they were taken immediately.  T hey also had to 
register with thepolice.  Af ter that, oncethe police knew where the Jewish people lived, it was 
p ic k in g
 
them  up, sending them  to transit camps.  
 
 
Men were takenf irst.  Eventually, in 19
 
--
 
in July of  1942, and there were other 
round
-
ups, there was a m ajor round
-
up where wom en and children were taken. 
 
>> Bill Benson: T hat is probably when your m other we
nt?  
 

>> Jacques Fein: Aroundthat time.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  You think your father was a year beforethat?  
 
>> Jacques Fein: 1941.  W ehave evidenceof  that. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  You do have evidence of that?  
 
>> Jacques Fein:  Yes.  
 
>> Bill Benson: W here was he sent?

>> Jacques Fein:  I need to makea comm ent on these pictures.  Most of  youprobably have an 
album  of your lif e when you were kids. T his is m y album . It's like am asterpiece.  Form eto 
collect all thesepictures tookm e years and years and years.  It was not given tom e by m y 
fam ily or cousinsor relatives.  I had some papers here.  I went to France, I got somem ore 
pictures. So it probably took m e about 30 years to collect this sim ple album.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Maybe when we're done and
 
you step down to talk to folks, som ebody m ight 
have an interest in taking a lookat that, if  that's possible.  
 
>> Jacques Fein:  Right.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  He went to Pithiviers. W hatwas that? It's a transitcam p.  
 
>> Jacques Fein: A transit cam p.  It was basically f or male, m en.  Ihave not really researched 

it.  But I've donem oreunderstanding of a cam pthat was a muchmore horrible camp. It was in 
1941
-
42,the heatof  the war already, in France, andnext step was Pithiviers, trains, cattle cars 
a
ndm urder into Auschwitz.  
 
 
Judee and I visited Paris about 15 years ago,we did go to
 
--
 
we didsee the town, it was 
apartm ent buildings.  Wehad no idea what it was really l ike.  
 

 
Speaking of
 
--
 
if  anybody saw a m ovie called" Sara'sKey,"  that wasthe m ovie.  In som e 
sense, it was the story of my m other.  
 
>> Bill Benson: W e'll com e back tothat, Ihope, inaf ew m oments. You have the photo ofyour 
father in Pithiviers.  How did you get thatphoto?  
 
>> Jacques Fein:  No idea.  Except,I think Iwent to Paris to see one of my cousinsand I think I 

picked it up f rom them .  As a matter of  fact, a few of  these, one of  the pictures of  my fam ily,  I 

9

got that in 19
 
--
 
m id 80s f rom m y sister.  She hadhad thosepictures for quite a number of 
years, m aybe 10, 12 years I think. I had written to her, because you m entionedthe Am erican 
gathering, that is when I started to get interested as to whathad happened and who was I,the 
fam ily.  I wrote tom y sister if she knew anything about ourf am ily in France, and she
 
said oh, 
no, they're probably no longer
 
--
 
oneof  them  is no longer alive.  Sara. W ell, I did get a letter 
f rom her. That'show I got those pictures.  
 
>> Bill Benson: T hatwas in the 1980s?  
 
>> Jacques Fein:  Right.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  You had not seen those photos until that time? 
 
>> Jacques Fein:  Nowa y.  
 
>> Bill Benson: T hat really illustrates ver y well what it m eant to put together these pictures over 
decades.  
 
>> Jacques Fein:  Right.  I was about 50 years old. T hat was thef irst time Ihad
 
seen a picture 
of m y f atherand m y motherand m y cousins,but they were m uch younger.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Fromwhat you know, Jacques, som etim e af ter your father was taken, and 
bef ore your m other was also caught ina Germ an round
-
up that we'll talk more about, your 
m other som ehow arrangedfor you to be hidden with a French Catholic fam ily.  T ell us what you 

know about her round
-
up to the extent that you know and where she was taken,before we talk 
about being placed with the Bocahuts.  
 
>> Jacques Fein:  From  what Iunderstand,again, when JudeeandI went toParis anum ber of  
years ago, we actually visited thefam ily thathid m e.  It was somewhat awkward, but that's 

10
 
 
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT

another story.  I was told that during her
 
--
 
som ehow she was visitin g us, m e andm y sister.
  
W hen she was back in the Metro, shem ay have not put on a yellow badge, she wasf idgety 
with the yellow star.  You know, in Paris youhadto wear a star to show that you were Jewish.  
 
>> Bill Benson: T he Metro being their train system?  
 
>> Jacques Fein: TheMetro, their train system . She got caught along the way.  T hat's what I 
understand.  It was also around July 1942. That's when the Frenchpolice and Germans were 
desperate.  Unfortunately, enthusiastic aboutcapturing asm any Jews as possible. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Moments ago, youtoldus about that really infamous, huge round
-
up ,  af f i l i a t e d 
with the bicycle stadium , theVeladrome. Tell us about that. I know you around
 
--
 
tell us about 
that.  You learned about that. 
 
>>
 
Jacques Fein:  It was absolutely horrendous.  Kids,f am ilies,m ostly women and children 
were taken. They had no,hardly any food, no m eansof  cleaning themselves, bathroom  

facilities were vi rtually nonexistent.  It was hot, hum id. People were killed immediately at tim es. 
Physicall y or they just died. Then they were sent to Auschwitz, in cattle cars toAuschwitz.   
 
>> Bill Benson: T hatwas July 16
-
17, 1942.W hen you were last with us, it was the70th 
anniversary of  that.  Over those two days, that rou
nd
-
up, Ibelieve 13,000 Jews were rounded 
up,huge,huge number, largest arrest ever of Jews in Paris.  
 
>> Jacques Fein:  Right.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Sof rom the Veladrom e, those that didn'tdie went to the transit cam ps.  
 
>> Jacques Fein: That was the pl
an .   
 
>> Bill Benson: T hen to Auschwit z.  
 

11
 
 
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT
 
NOT A VERBATIM RECORD
 
 
>> Jacques Fein:  Correct.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  YoumentionedSara'sKey is thebook that represents that story.  You saidthat 
does, asfar as you know, a rem arkable job of  capturing what happened in thatparticul
a r 
round
-
up. Tell usm ore about Drancy.  Youm entioned it was aterrible place, and whathave 
you learned about Drancy?  Because that's where you believe your m other went, right?  
 
>> Jacques Fein: She was sent there. Shem ay have been sent there, but she was, again, 

captured ina Metro,f rom  what I understand.W hether she was sent to Drancy or not, I'm not 
sure, but it was basically, odds are,that shewas.  Because, we have evidence. T he evidence 
actually comesf rom  the Germ ans. T hey kept excellent records, and they kept the list of nam es 
of  people who were deportedf rom  France toAuschwitz.  
 
 
For exam ple, there's a famous Nazi hunter called  Arthur Crosf ield. He compileda book 
of  Jews deportedf rom  France,about80,000Jews.  Here I was able tof indm y parents, m y 
m other's name andm y parents' name.  My father was taken on the third toAuschwitz.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  You've got the record there?  
 
>> Jacques Fein: Exactly.  Plus other records f rom the French police that specif ies roughly 
when they were taken, and where they were.  
 
>> Bill Benson: W hendid you learn then with certainty that they wer e taken to Auschwitz a nd 
when they perished? 
 
>> Jacques Fein: W ell, we'll have to skip anum ber of years.  I was put in hiding roughly in 

1941.  
 
>> 
Bill Benson: W e'll com e back tothat.  Just looking ahead.  
 

12
 
 
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT
 
NOT A VERBATIM RECORD
 
 
>> Jacques Fein:  I would say af ter the war, those who survived and those who were put in 
hiding, I was put in hiding by the OSE organization, their job during the war was to save the 
kid s.   Af t
er the war, it was to take them backandtry to reunite them with their families.  If they 
couldn't, we were put in orphanages. W hen I was sent to the orphanage, two of them , were in 

the same boat, waiting forf am ily.  I assum e people talked and weretold
 
what happened,but I 
can't rem em ber the exact time ordate when I knew.  
 

>> Bill Benson:  I was
 
--
 
you said you had such precise inf orm ation. I was curious as to when 
you really learned with certainty.  
 
>> Jacques Fein: W ith certainty it was 1983, the
 
second gathering of Jewish Holocaust 
survi vors inW ashington, DC.  I was able to get thisbook, and it was good to go through the 

book.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  30 years ago?  
 
>> Jacques Fein:  Right.  For certainty.  I knew bef orehand. 
 
>>
 
Bill Benson:  Jacques, before yourm other was taken,probably the summ er, July, 1942, 
clearly at thattime she was able to arrange,workin g with the OSE to have you hidden with this 
Catholicfam ily, French family, the Bocahuts. T ell us what you can about
 
what you thinkor 
know about how shemay have been able to do that,and thenaboutbeing with the Bocahuts.  
 
>> Jacques Fein:  OK. My gutf eeling is that the OSE were the primary people who knew 
where Jews were, andthere must have beensom e type of connection.  
 
>> Bill Benson: T heywere a French organization?  
 

13
 
 
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT
 
NOT A VERBATIM RECORD
 
 
>> Jacques Fein:  In every Je wish comm unity there's afederation,as you know over here, 
you've got lists of names.  Buthow was it in Paris?  Idon't know.  They hadtobe registered 
with the police.  
 
 
So the OSE,the Jewis h social services in a sense, knew, and that'sthebestthing I 
know.  How did m y m other know?  I don't know if  she spoke French.  She was f romPoland.  As 
they say in French,I really don't know.  But som epeople knew.  That's the connection.  
 
 
So they putm e with the Bocahutf am ily in 1941
-
42, and just to let you know, m y birth 
fam ily was f am ily number one.  Fam ily num ber two was m y f osterfam ily, theBocahuts.  
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us what you canabout your life with the Bocahuts, because you would stay 

with them until the war's end.  
 
>> Jacques Fein:  Right.  I was hidden, roughly, in 1942, the war
 
--
 
Paris was liberated in 
August 1944. T he war ended in Europe May 8, I think,1945. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  You were with them  alm ost three,four years?  
 
>> Jacques Fein: Three,four years.  
 
 
OK, so several things.  First, it wasn't like being hidden like Anne Frank, where she had 
to be hidden in a room of  an apartm ent building.  I was hidden in af arm  outsideof  Paris, a 
pl
ace called Vers
-
Galant.  It was pretty m uchopen.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Very rural area?  
 
>> Jacques Fein: Very rural, ver y open.  Judee andI visited that place a number of years ago, 
but it'sm uchm ore suburban than at that tim e.  
 
 
T hef am ily, I remember
 
being there, not being scared, beingf ed.  Idon'tthinkI went

don'tthinkI went to school. I rem em ber theolder kids,the older children, about several of 
t h em .  I  r em em b e r
 
--
 
Iunderstand they hid a few other kids,butI have no recollection of 
tha t.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  How m any kids did they have?  
 
>> Jacques Fein:  I thinkf our orf ive.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  And there's you and your sister, so at least six children inthis house.  
 
>> Jacques Fein: And others.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Possibly others, 
OK.  
 
>> Jacques Fein:  I rem em ber afew things during that tim e.  So I was
 
--
 
I was born in1938.  
Maybe I was 5 years old.  One tim em yf oster father took m y sister and I, since we were ona 

farm ,hehidus in a ditch. W hydid he hide,putm e ina ditch? Because he understood there 
were Germ an soldierslookingf or either Jews or peoplehiding Jews.  So we were ver y, ver y 
lucky.  He putboth of us in aditch with a blanket, andI could seef rom a distance,maybe 100
 
--
 
not100 yards, 150 yards, soldiers with guns.  I guess ithad tobe guns, anddogs.  
 
 
Som y sister andI were purely lucky, because I didn't cry, shedidn't cry.  T he wind was 
blowing the right direction. It was blowing another direction. Had they moved towards thefarm , 

I don't think I wouldbe here today.  So thatI do remember pretty clearly.  I can tell you,I'm not 
alwa ys toof ondof  Germ an Shepherds,especially.  
 
 
T henanothertim e, which I vaguely rem ember, I was sick, and Ihadbeen sent to a 
hospital in Paris. W hy?  I have no idea.  It was obviously dangerous. W hen I went back to 
Paris, back in the 1980s, they told me thefather tookme out of the hospitalas quickly as 
possible.

have been com pletely different, but lives of Am ericans 
would be obviously in a different sphere altogether. It was them ost

the war thathad tobe

I remember thatone day, it was a hot summ er day, sunny, and theAlliedf o

being Jewish again, becauseby the tim eI was there, I guessI was about 7 years old, I had 
been brought up basically in a Catholic envir onment.  So we learned about being Jewish,which 
was ver y im portant.  
 
 
I'm  sure som eof  the kids were reunited with their parents or with their auntsand uncles.

the United Jewish Appeal, right, where Jewish people give m oney to thef ederation.

W ell,m y cousin,notmy blood cousin butm y adopted cousin, sort of adopted cousin, told

>> Bill Benson: T hat's all partof  this remarkable volunteer work that you do in many places.  
My hom e county of  Howard County is the sam eas Jacques.  Ithink it's great they namedhim  
Volunteer of the Yearfor our county.

Bill Benson: W e have tim e, I think, to turnto our audience to askif  they have any questions 
to ask you. W e have m icrophones, so whatwe'd like you to do is wait until you have the 

m icrophone in hand. Make your questionas short as you can.  If I think we need to repeat it so 
ever ybody hears it or just make sure Jacques hears it, I will repeat it.  T ry to make itas brief  as 
you can, then Jacques will respond.  
 
 
Do we have anybody who has a questionthey'd like to ask? W hile you're thinking about 
it ,
 
I will continue with my line of inquiry. W e'llsee if anybody hasa question out there.T here's

a brave soul right there in the m iddle.  
 
>>W ho was your bestf riend in France?  
 
>> Bill Benson: W howas your bestf riend in France?  
 
>> Jacques Fein:  Interesting question.  For som e reason,I rem em ber in the second 
orphanage, in Taverny, and I'm  no longer intouch with that guy, but one winter when he cam e 
to the orphanage it was ver y cold, and Ihad two glo ves.  I gave him one glove.  His name is 
George
.  It was George.  Idon't know wherehe is now.  Som e kidnam ed George.  He was 
happy to get another glove.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Absolutely.  Right here. Here's am ic com ing to you, right behind you.  
 
>> T hank you som uch for sharing your story with us.  You mentioned very brief ly that your 

m eeting with your second fam ily was awk wa r d when you were anadult when you went back to 
France.  Can you tell us m ore about that, what it was like, how you found them?  
 
>> Jacques Fein:  Yes.  I lef t them in 1945.  Our ties were broken, com pletely broken. So go 

forward to 1983. T hat's when I met them again.  58 years?  
 
>> Bill Benson:  58 years.  
 
>> Jacques Fein: 58 years. T o meetthem . You went there, and Im et

it's ver y im portant, I went to the 
OSE offices in Paris.  Part of the dossier told m e exactly where they were li ving, 148th Street or 
whatever. W hen I went there, I visitedm y cousins in Paris, that's also importan
t, because they 
knew the way.  T hey spoke French. T hey took me there. But they hadm oved to146, next 

door. Then I came in,and Judee was there. I thinkI was theretwic e.  I said

who I was.  T hey saidJackie? They were ve ry surprised.  I knew they had another sisterand 
another brother, but unfortunately thetwo sisters were not getting along.  So we tried to talk 
about that, but again,Ihadnot seen them f or58 years.  Ididn't know exactly what to do

other 
than thanking them.  I couldn't really get m y act together.  It was ver y a wkward.  ButI did write 

to  the m afte rwa rd s.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Mr.
 
A nd  Mrs .
 
Bocahut passed away b y that tim e?  
 
>> Jacques Fein:  Yeah. The parents had passed away.  
 

>> Bill Benson: T hank you. W e have another question? One right here in thef ront, thena 
gentleman back there.  
 
>> I also want toechothanksf or speaking today.  So youm entioned being part of a group, and 

I know survi vors and even children of survivo rs in our comm unities tend to seek
 
eachother out.  
I wonder if  there are certain experiences youfeel you've had in this country that strike you and 

m ake you, andeven your children,f eel like this experiencethat you had during the war years 
sets you apart.  
 
 
I also noticed you m entione
d 1983a couple of tim es, whetherthat was a sem inal time in 
m aking you decide you wanted to learn moreabout your history or when you kind of cam e to 
the ideathat you did.  
 
>> Jacques Fein:  OK. There were two partsof  the question. One dealing with why was 1983 

im portant.  
 
>> Bill Benson: W as there something signif icantabout1983?  Right.

>> Jacques Fein:  OK. So I was born in1938.  By the tim e you're inyour 40s, 38 to 45 is not 
thatm uch. 1983,people kindof  have to dealwith their past,especially people like us.  It was 
notonly m e. Afew people inW ashington. The sam e thing happened inPhiladelphia, in 
Ne w
 
York, in Los
 
Angeles.  Five different places all over the country.  But kids who were
 
--
 
people in sim ilar situation weref inding out, were trying to organize and see what was 

happening. And 1983was the gathering of Am erican Jewish Holocaust survi vors.  T hat was 
like af ocus,a place tocom e. W em et other
 
--
 
I metaf ew other people in the sam e situation.  
So that helped out.  It wa
s basically in the m id
-
40s, a m id
 
--
 
we ll,  s o rt  of m id lif e  c ris is ,  bu t  I  
really needed to know, hey, what happened. I had af riend whohassince passedaway, she 
lived in Colum bia.  I said let's go. She saidno, I'm  not a survi vor.  Isaid Amy, we' ve got
 
t o go .   
T his is theplace tobe, or else we'll never really f ind outm ore. T hatwas a good question.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Jacques, I think you toldm ethatthe very f irst gathering of  child survivors t hat 
you went to was like 18 people, and now there's sev
eral thousand?  
 
>> Jacques Fein:  Right.  In 1983 was the conf erence. W ehad af ew peoplef romW ashington 

that m et, some people f rom  Philadelphia.  So in 1985, about 18 people f rom Boston, 
Philadelphia, New
 
Yor k, Philly andW ashingtonm et in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, the Continental 
Inn,because am ong other things, theowner was a Holocaust survi vor.  So there were about 18 

of  us.  Judee was partof  the 18.  
 
 
From  that, we said we've got to organize. W e've got tof orm  our group. T he reason is 
t h is,  be ca
use I guarantee if  I asked you thenwhat a Holocaust survivor was, 99% of people will 
say concentration camp, labor cam p.  Right? Butpeopledidn'tthink that people who were in

hiding were survi vors.  T hey were def initely survi vors.  Som epeoplesurvi ved
 
on their own.  So 
it wasn't exactly the easiest thing to do.  
 
 
Af riend of m ine, who survived in Poland,hadto swim  a river to escape the Germans, 
except she didn't know how to swim , but shesurvi ved by s wim m ing that river.  So wef elt we 
had to organiz
e and say, hey, we have to be together.  Now we're just m uchm oreaccepted 
within the Holocaust comm unity, number one.  Andf rom  that small conf erence, am eeting that 

we had about 18 in Lancaster,Pennsylvania, other groupsform ed,andnow we' ve got gro ups
 
over the United States.  Maybe, I don't know,m aybe 50 groups, several thousandpeople.  

Groupsalso overseas, in Europeand Israel,andSouthAmerica.  So that was ver y im portant. 
 
>> Bill Benson: W e have tim ef orone more question.  A young m anright here in red.  
 
>> Hello.  My nam e isPujan.  My f riend and I traveledf rom  Kenya to be here today.  I have two 
questionsfor you.  How was lif e living in Fra nce,becausef rom  what we're aware the Nazis had 
taken all of the supplies and living was ver y difficult andm any people were living in starvati on.  
How was lif e living in hiding in France?  
 
 
My second question was how did the Nazis identif y Jewish people?  Becausethey look 
awf ully sim ilar with theEuropeans.  How did they pinpoint thathe isa Jewish
 
person?  
 
>> Bill Benson:  First question was because it was war and there was scarcity, how did that 

aff ect you to your knowledge?  Is that afairwa y of  summ arizing that?  
 
 
T he second question is how did the Nazis
 
--
  
>> Jacques Fein:  Right, thef irst
 
question, as I mentioned, for me,OK, I lived, I was hidden on 
af arm . They were a bit isolatedf rom any starvation. T hey grew their own f ood,m ilk and

things. W e hadfood. It was not like living in Paris, which was grou nd zerofor the war.  
 
 
Now how
 
did the Nazis know us, or recognize  us? W ell,there was a decree.  Once 
Germ any invaded Paris, they decreedthat all Jews had to be identif ied by the police, signed up.  
Most of the Jews in Paris, f orexam ple, lived in one sectionof  the city.  So that was kind of 
easy.  It was not only the Nazis, it was the Frenchpolice that helped out.  
 
Now, in the southern part of  Francenotmany Jews were killed or taken,because it was much 

m ore spread out,and the villagers and the people there were able to hide kids and adultsmuch 
easier. That was them ain diff erence.  It was an interesting question.  
 
>> Bill Benson: T hank you.

f riends, Judee, Rachel, and Phil and Cookiefor com ing here, supporting me.  And tothank all 
of  youf orbeing here.  W e never know how m any people are going to show up.  It so happens I 
m et three,four people I've spokento,two I've spoken to over the years, and here they arenow, 
f rom  theGreaterW ashington area.  Younever know who will sho w up.  
 
 
I was pleased, this is m y third year of  doing this, m y intent was to let you know that 
survi vors were not only in concentration camps, or labor cam ps. Believe m e,had Ibeen ina 
concentration cam pat the age of 3,4, I would never behere.  Germans would have killedm e.  
 
 
Our lives were notexactly a picnic, but som ehow som eof  the kidswho survi ved in hiding 
hadterrible lives, tough lives.  T hat was m ym ainfocus.  
 
 
Num ber two, it's like my responsibility to tell whoever I can what happened. It really 
happened.W hat was the m ovie about" Saving Pri vate Ryan" ? W hen they landed in 
Norm andy.  All I can tell people, this really happened.  I wasn't toofar away f rom  Norm andy 
when that happened.  It really happened.
