Abstract 
Aaron Laro was born Ma rch 23, 1919 in Zdzieciol, 
Poland.  He says it always had anti-Semitism. 
In 1937, signs were posted dema nding a boycott of
 Jewish-owned shops. After war broke out, 
Jewish property was confiscated, including the 
Laro™s six-room house. Aaron and others hid 
weapons in the woods.  
A ghetto was built in January 1942 in Novogrudek (Navahruda k, Belarus) , and Jews had to move 
there and wear the yellow Star of David. He says
 there were two ma ssacres, but speaks of only 
one, in April 1942, when 800 people were killed. 

 

He escaped from the ghetto and joined partisans 
in the woods. He was a machinist, and repaired 
tanks and other vehicles they found. They also found Jewish families hiding in the woods. 
Russians split the Jews from the partisans.
 Anti-Se mitism was strong in the woods. But a 
Russian major threatened to kill all part
isans if any one of them killed a Jew. 
 
Aaron ma de  a detonator that dera
iled a train going to Vilna. Th
en, he helped derail three more 
trains.  

 

The Russian army liberated them in 1944, and wit
hout letting them wash or rest, incorporated 
them into their troops. Aaron fought in many battles,
 and st ill has a bullet n
ear his heart, a piece 
of shrapnel in his head, and a leg injury.  

 

After a mont h in a hospital where he recuperate

ma de a sergeant. He deserted from the Russian army in autumn 1944. He emigrated to the United 

States in June 1947, with the woma n who had been
 with him throughout their time in the woods.  

They ma rried in the U.S. 

 

Aaron said that as a Jew, he ﬁdidn™t regret 
for one mi nuteﬂ the blood he 
spilled fighting against 
Nazi Germa ny ﬁbecause I took reve nge for my fa mily and for  the six million Jewish pe ople.ﬂ 

 

 
Interview 
My name  is Aaron Laro.  I was born March 23, 1919.  Zdzieciol, Poland. 
Can you tell me  a little about 
your childhood?   And also where 
you grew up, a little bit about 
your town, a little bit about your
 childhood and also about your pa
rents, what your father did, 
you know, what your mother did – 

I was born in a small town in about -- actually 
by the end -- before the wa r we were about 4,000 
Jewish people. 
You reme mber anything that
 stands out in your childhood 
when you were growing up? 
No. 

No?   Okay, that™s all right.  Di
d you have brothers and sisters? 
I had one brother and two sisters– 
Don™t mi nd me  when I™m writing, you can just k
eep talking, don™t worry about it.  Can you tell 
me  a little bit about your parents, what your father did for a living, and that kind of thing? 
My father did two things, he was a shoe ma
ker and then had a shoe store partnership. 
Who was he  a partner with, do you reme mber? 
Well, one moved to Israel.  His partner 
was Altavanietsky and Elovitch(?) (27). 
Do you remember, like, the street that you lived
 on?   Do you reme mber much about the area you 
lived in before the war? 

I reme mber, what– 

Anything distinctive that you reme mber about it,
 you know?   What the houses ma y ha ve looked 
like? 
Well, we had in 1935 a fire, which a tenth of th
e town burned down.  And after that came  up a 
beautiful town; they ma de beautiful streets wi
th sidewalks and nice homes ma de out of wood, 
and gold me tal roofs, gold metal roofs mostl
y, and was nice painted, and governme nt forced 
people to ma ke picket fences and paint them white yes, was very clean, very clean.  Was a big 
change in 1935.  My father built a big six room 
house, beautiful house -- but it didn™t last long. 
In 1939 the war broke out, actually
 broke out in ‚41, and we lived
 only six years in the new 
house. Everything was taken away. Now gentiles are 
living over there, we had to just run away. 
Do you remember when you were growing up?   
Oh, first let me  ask you where did you go to 

school?   Did you go to a public schoo
l or a private school or a– 
It was a private Jewish school. 
A private Jewish school. 

What was the school like? 
What do you mean what was it like? 
What did you study there?   What did you do? 
Well, Polish was what you say in English, compul
sory, you had to.  So we had every day one 
hour of Polish and Polish history, Jewish and Hebr
ew, we had a gym, we  had a teacher for sport, 
gymnastic. 

Did you play any sports? 
Yeah, we used to have performa nces twice a year on Hanukkah and on Purim.  
Do you remember any instances of anti
-Semitism when you were growing up? 
It was always anti-Semitic over there, 
in Poland and in Russia, everybody knows it. 
Do you remember any, you know, instances that st
and out in your mi nd that were that, you 
know, specifically reme mber that really you can recall? 

About anti-Se mitism?   Well, in 1937 when Hitler 
start spreading all over, they put up signs on 
the walls on the Polish church that the gentiles
 should boycott Jewish people, not shop from 
Jewish people.  That™s the most outstanding mo me
nt.  Otherwise was tolerable, you know what I 
mean?   Jewish people go ahead traveling the v
illages, buying from the farmers their product.  I 
could hear sometimes a slur, 
or something else, but when 
my father was young they had 
pogroms.  In Russian times, it was much wors
e.  Poland was a democracy but the Pas Outsky 

[ph] was a general, and he had them under c
ontrol, you know what I me an?   It was half 
democracy and ruled by a general so–and he was not 
a little bit sympathetic to Jewish people.  
But then the anti-Semitism was spreading all over Poland.  Hitler pene trated Poland in the ‚30s 

and it was getting worse and worse.  
Were people in your town afraid of the Nazis?
  I mean, did you know 
what was going on in 
Germany at this time? 
Well, obviously every Ge rman knew.  Some body goi
ng tell you they didn™t
 notice is baloney.  
Only if they couldn™t read and didn™
t know what was going on in the world. 
Did people leave?   We re they that fri
ghtened that they would leave Poland? 
No.  

They weren™t that frightened?   They justŠ 
No. 
But they knew whatŠyou know, mo st 
people knew what was going on? 
Wait one second, you see the Jewish people in we
stern Poland, when they were occupied by 
Nazi Germa ny, they were escaping 
to Russia, in our territory. 

Going the other way? 
That™s why every town where we lived we had 
a lot of displaced persons, what you call them, 
runaways?  
Refugees? 
Refugees, we had a lot of refugees. 

Who were comi ngŠ? 
But we had nowhere to run. 
Yeah. 

We were ready.  I reme mber that too.  We  got 
our bicycles, we took our belongings.  When the 
war broke out, we figured we were going to run 
to Russia, but the Germany army was  moving so 
fast Š 

It caught up to you. 

It caught up to kill, they bomb
arded on the highways and a lot of our people came  back, they 
came back. 
Mmhmm. 
But a couple days later it was 1939. 

Yeah. 
The Russian army ca me  over and we were liber
ated and under the Russians we didn™t show anti-
Se mitism.  Jewish people got better jobs.  You know what I mean? 
Yeah, sure. 

Jewish people got better jobs and, while we were
 partisans, we had anti-Semitism again.  And an 
aunt was raped and killed. 
And that™s on the Russians side? 
Yeah, partisans, we were
 together in the woods. 
Right. 
They disarmed Jewish partisans 
for any little thing.  If a gentil
e took boots from a farmer, it was 
nothing, but if a Jew took a pair 
of boots, they killed him.  
Right. 

Yeah. 
Can you tell me , you we re just talking about coll
ecting you know, bicycles getting ready to run 
to the Russian side.  Can you tell me about th
at period where, the Germans are comi ng and you 

know they™re invading and you™re ru
nning away.  Can you tell me  about that, like what kind of 
preparations you ma de to run to 
the Russian side, what you took? 
I took about– We  went through th
at strategy twice, in 1939 but it 
lasted two days because soon 
we hear on the radio that the Russian army cr
oss the border and are comi ng to liberate us, we 
weren™t scared anymore, because the Germans we
re still 150 kilome ters from us.  And we knew 
that they divided Poland (#102) in 
half, so we were jumping in the skies, we are so glad.  The 
Russians are comi ng. We didn™t know at that
 time they were anti-Semites, too. 
Right. 
But everybody thought communis m i s th
e ______ comi ng for Jewish people. 
Did your whole family try to go? 

No, no. 

Run away or– 
No, no, you have small kids it™s very hard. Bu
t the worst problem was in 1941 when the war 
started with Russia, so people ran away and the 
Russian army cut them off, the German army, 
and they come  back, and we were stuck in ghettos. 
Right, Okay.  Why don™t you tell me  a little about
 when you start to run away and then the 
Russians come  in and you first s
ee the Russians the first time in 1939. 

I™ll give an example.  I was already 19 years ol
d. I wasn™t so emotional,
 but my younge r brother, 
I reme mber he was kissing the Russian tanks. 
 Yeah, people were climbi ng on the tanks and 
kissing them, because it was diffe
rence between life and death. 
Sure.  How far did you run before you knew that theŠjust, you said something about two days, 
but how far did you get away from your town be
fore– Not far, not far because right away we 
could hear on the radios, 
the Russian army™s coming. 
Okay, can you tell me , when the Russians come  in 
and take over that area of Poland, what was it 
like?   I mean, what did they do?   Did they, you sa id there was some  anti-Se mitism, did they 
enact laws against the Jews? 
No, no, no.  In 1939, when they came in it was very good.  Everybody suffered later on.  You 
know what I mean?   Communis m m
eant nothing.  They cleaned out
, as a ma tter of fact, they 
cleaned out all our stores.  They 
bought, they had money, but that™s it. 
Yeah. 
But we didn™t suffer from anti-Semitism in 1939-40 
until the Nazis came in.  We  suffered from 
them in the partisans (?), fr om the Russians– 
Okay.  What was the RussianŠwhat was the rule
 like?   How wasŠdid your lives change very 
much because the Russians were there?   Did they impose any of their, you know ... 

The lives changed comp letely af
ter two month we realize, it 
is a __________ (#130) at us and we 
they nothing but, the only thi
ng they have is propaganda. 
Mmhmm. 
There was no food, no clothing. You couldn™t travel
 by train, you needed a permit to go from one 
town to another town.  You were just a prisoner. 
Okay, and this lasted, you said, the Ru
ssians come in late September of ™39. 
Yes. 
And they were there until 1941? 
Until June 22, when the war broke out, 1941. 
Okay.  Did they seize any of the bus
inesses and try to nationalize them?  
Oh, the Russians?   Sure.  They took over everythi
ng.  They controlled every part of your life.  
Your heart and your soul.  Your body. 
We had a six room hous e, for fa mily of six it™s not too much.  They wanted to nationalize the 
house.  Take away the house, not take it away 
but we would have to pa
y like taxes on the house 
because the square feet, it was too 
big for a family of six.  My father bribed the head from the 
finance departme nt and my daughterŠmy younger sist
er got a job in that 
office, so we invited 
him for dinner. 
Yeah. 
And it cut the me ters, he said a 120 square me
ters and he ma de it 110, and the house was still 
ours. That wa s life in Russia. 

Okay, why don™t you tell me  a little about when the Germans come  back in, in 1941. 
Well, when the Germans came back in 1941, we 
knew it was the beginning of our end.  We  
knew it. 
Did you, were people in that area did they know, 
I don™t know, most of t he camps and things 
hadn™t been set up.  Did they know of concentr
ation camps in Germany and, you know that kind 
of thing about places like Auschwitz and– Do you reme mbe r  if you knew? 
I am not sure.  We  knew they were taking aw
ay a lot of Jewish people.  We knew it. 
But you weren™t sure where they were going? 
We didn™t know that mu ch by that time . But one
 ma n, the ma yor in our town from Lodz, a big 
city in Poland, he was lucky he 
escaped and he came  back because he ma rried, his wife was from 
our town Zdzienceil and he came back and he told
 us, assemb led a lot of Jewish people and told 
them to dig a big grave with spoons–  
With spoons ? 

With spoons , and he came and he told us it™s tragic, he sa
ys it™s our end. 
Did people not believe him, wh
en he told those things? 
Ah yes, ah yeah, ah yeah, but there was nowhere to run? 

Yeah. 

You see the population, all th
e population was against us. 
Mmhmm. 

So, at the mo me nt, you didn™t have where to go. 
 If the population is with you, then it™s okay.  
But when the population is against you, the mo me
nt that you [the Jew? ] walked out from the 
ghetto, they were pointing to the Germans, Jude
.  A Jew.  You could 
recognize a Je w, always. 
Sure.  It™s interesting you say that, because 
I™ve had interviews where people say, ﬁThey didn™t 
fear the Germans so much as they feared, esp
ecially in Poland, thei
r neighbors.ﬂ Because the 
Germans seemed, according to these people who I™ve 
talked to, seemed not 
to really know who 
was Jewish.  But the Poles could point them 
out.  You know, who knew exactly who was Jewish 
so there was, so they didn™t really fear the 
Germans as much as they
 feared–their neighbors. 
They didn™t fearŠthe soldiers weren™t so bad.  
You reme mbe r  the soldiers were standing near 
your house, stopped to rest for a while, and 
one young Germa n came over and was talking to 
them a little.  He said, ﬁNow it™s not going to be 
bad for you.  When the S.S. are going to come ,ﬂ 
he warned, ﬁthen it™s going to start a lot of 
trouble for you.ﬂ  But he 
was looking with a little 
sympathy, you could– right? 
Wi fe:   Yeah.  Excuse me , can I talk? 
Interviewer:  Sure, go ahead. 
Wi fe:   We had to wear yellow ma rks– 

Aaron Laro:  Star of David now? 
Wi fe:   Because we are Jews and we ar
e not allowed to wa lk on the sidewalk. 
Interviewer:  Now this is after the Germans–? 
Aaron Laro:  That™s in the ghetto, 
that started in the ghetto, yeah. 
Interviewer:  When the Germans (were in)? 
Wi fe:  There was one German, where she was 
working cleaning then, he once said to her 
and a friend, ﬁmaybe you should run away
 in the woods, but how will you survive 
the winter? ﬂ 
[Cannot understand her words here - #184] 
Aaron Laro:  No, no, no, he was short.  I reme mbe r  him, yeah. Short-headed guy ...  

Wi fe: Said, ﬁI don™t know why Hitler doesn™t like the Je wish people.ﬂ 
Interviewer: He said this? 
Aaron Laro:   Yeah! 
Wi fe:  Turned back to me  and that they stink in Germany. 

Aaron Laro:   He said, ﬁIn Ru
ssia, in White Russia, Polacks 
they stink,ﬂ he says. ﬁYou are 
intelligent pe ople, what does he want from you?  
Wi fe:  ﬁTheystinkthey™r
e stupid, they stink.ﬂ 
Interviewer:   Yeah. 

Wi fe:  That™s what he said to me.  He car
ed for the Jewish people.  He was a nice guy. 
Interviewer: Yeah. 

Wi fe:  A policeman, a gendarme.  He™s a policeman. 
Interviewer: Right. 
Aaron Laro: So I was working over thereŠI wa
s starting to learn for a ma chinist, an 
electrician in a power station.  So when the Ge
rmans ca me  i n, the power station was supposed to 
run.  Then they gave me  a permit, I was walking 
during the night by myself and I used to turn off 
the lights, we had light s until one o™cl ock, I think.  And the Germans used to come across me, 

but they were patrolling the town.  I used to see, with ____________ (181).  He never touched 

me .  _______ (194) and I used to 
go through the gates, back to th
e ghettoŠhe never touched me . 
It was interesting.  Why don™t you tell me  a little 
bit about when the Germans first get there and 
what you did and what your fa mily did when the Ge
rmans come  through in 41?   Before we get to 
the ghetto.  We can talk 
about the ghetto later. 
Well, when they came in they were bombarding, so
 we run away in the outskirts of the town 

where my father™s fr iends, White Russi
ans, we go over there for two days. 
Interviewer: What did you take with you when you ran? 
Nothing.  We were in the same  town, I took my bi
cycle.  A lot of people 
even didn™t run from the 
town.  People were resigned.  We  knew there wa
s nowhere to go.  And then we came back.  We  
were lucky we were still in our homes from July until Ja nuary 1942, then they ma de the ghetto 
for us.  I don™t know why we were so lucky.  Some  other towns they ma de ghettos right away, 

and we were living, going on w
ith a normal life.  The only th
ing, we couldn™t walk on the 
sidewalks and the Star of
 David we had to wear. 
So they ma de you wear the Star of David afterthey came in.  Was it imme diately or did they 

ma ke you wear an arm band as soon as they came in? 
I think it was ma ybe a month after, as soon as 
they came in.  I don™t reme mber exactly or two 
weeks. 

Why don™t you tell me  a lit
tle bit about the ghetto? 
The ghetto in order to go into the ghetto they ga
ve us from e i ght in the morning till two in the 
afternoon.  We had no machine, nothing, no trucks, 
no horses.  So how much would you take on 
the sled?   It was winter time .  So we moved in 
our aunt™s house, she had only three rooms.  We 
were sharing two fa milies in, so whatever we
 couldŠfurniture, forget about.  So we took 
clothing and I don™t remember, I think no furn
iture even, there was 
nowhere to put it. 
Was it just a ma tter of space, or di d the Ge
rmans not allow you to 
take certain things? 
I don™t think they didn™t allow, 
but they gave us six hours, fr
om eight until two, so how much 
furniture could you take, there was nowhere to put 
it, because my Aunt had a little apartment. 
Did you take food with you as well? 
Whatever we had, we took with us.  Sure. 

Was the ghetto fenced, closed? 
Fenced. 
What was the fence?   Was it stone or picket?  

Picket.  It wa sn™t, look how ma
ny pe ople escaped.  You could jump over, it was a picket that 
high, that‚s all.  But the local
 police were patrolling around it. 
Were you allowedŠyou weren™t allowed to leave, 
legally. You were supposed to, you had some  
sort of pass to leave?   Wa s that how it was? 

Yeah.  They took Jewish people on the highways.  
They took Jewish people
 to cut trees in the 
woods so they used to take them out in groups.  
They used to take them out and uh, the Judenrat 
used to supply them.  They needed, let™s say, 100 people to go to the woods, they needed 100 
people, so they counted 100 pe
ople and they took them, used to
 ma rch like soldiers to the 
highways and to the woods. 
Now, were these people guarded by Germans or
 were they guarded by, like, Polish police? 
Police.  One German, the rest police. 

How large was the ghetto itself?   A few blocks? 
The ghetto, one, two, three, four, five.  I would 
say a kilome ter and half long and not too wideŠ
ten square blocks.  Te
n, eight square blocks. 
Did you go out on some  of these work details? 

Did I what? 
Did you go out on some  of these work details?  
You were talking about when they took people 
out to the woods or to fix the highways, 
did you do any of that?  
 Any of that work? 
No.  I was working at the power station. 

You were working at the power station. 
Yes. 
What did you do at the power station?   What was your job? 
My job was to take care of the machi nes.  I wa
s 18 years old and I c
ould take apart the big 
machines. 

So, did you do thatŠis that some thing you™d worked on before the war? 
I star ted in Poland to learn that trade.  Yeah. 
Wi fe:  Whe n he came here, he couldn™t get a job. 

When he came here, to the United States? 
Yeah.  Because it was a closed union.  It wa
s a non-gentile [? ] union, an electrical union, I 
couldn™t get in.  The United Jewish
 Appeal gentlema n told me , ﬁLie
 if you want, but forget about 
electrician.ﬂ  When a father dies, the son co
me s in in his place, they are so strict. 
Why don™t you tell me  a bout -- you said that ma ny 
people were able to escape.  Did you notice 
people leaving, did you know people who left before you left? 

No, not ma ny people.  We used to sneak
 out and take weapons in the woods. 
Oh, really.  Why don™t you tell me  s o me thing about that? 
Well, we used to realize that we don™t need so
 much clothing so we used to exchange with 
gentiles, give him a suit and get from him a rifle,
 bullets, grenades, revolv
er, whatever we could. 
And did you hide these things, you hid these things in the woods? 

We had it in the ghetto, in the baseme nt in a dr y place and we  used toŠwe were in touch with a 
Russian lieutenant and he was work
ing in a village near the forest, 
so he had cabin that he ma de 
in the woods, so we used 
to bring it in over there. 
Was there some body who was kind of running this ope
ration?   I don™t wa nt 
to call it an operation 
because I don™t know exactly– Was there somebody, 
like, in charge of 
gathering the weapons 
and everything? 
I know what you™re pointing at.  Our presiden
t of the Judenrat (279) was a lawyerŠAlta 
Boretsky (?).  Why did we pick him?    Because 
he was a smart ma n and he was the president of 
the Judenrat. So we picked some  of the Jewish m
ilitia in the ghetto in that  organization so we 
could know better what was going on around, because
 they were patrolling the ghetto.  They 
would not betray us.  Like in some  other ghettos 
a lot of Jewish people we re betrayed.  Not in 
our town.  We were a different breed.  And because
 of him, while he was in the Judenrat and he  
had a lot of money because the Germans were asking for mo ney, for gold, for fur.  So through 

him, we could get some  money and buy weapons to 
arm the Jewish people.  He was a smart ma n.  

So he was actually our leader. 

How ma ny people, that you know of
, were involved in trying to procure these weapons? 
Well, we were few groups.  I don™t know exactly
 what was going on in the other group, but I 
know they had workers, too.  They had ri
fles bought, but we we
re about eight guys. 
Can you describe for me , like, from start to finish
, what you would do in order to try to get these 
weapons?   Li ke the eight of you, wha t  the orga
nization was like, where you got the money, you 
said you got some  money from this lawyer, 
he would collect some  money or whatever. 
Yeah, but we used to exchange, give him clothing, 
shoes, whatever we could, a sewing ma chine.  
You know what I mean?   Who needs a sewing machine? 
Sure, right! 
So we give the fa mily (?), for them a sewing machine was like a million dollars. 
You had to sneak out in order to do this? 
Yeah. 
Did you do this at night, or mostly in the day? 

I have to put one thing.  The White Russian popul
ation was different, a qui
eter people than the 
Polacks.  That™s why some  Polis
h people told you they feared 
the Polacks, the local population 
more than the Germans.  Our people, the White
 Russians wereŠit™s a quieter element but they 
didn™t, you know what I mean, they 
didn™t point their fist or a finge
r on a Jews and the Polacks.  
That™s why we could operate easie
r.  You know cigarette holder, 
chromi um was in Europe?   If 
you kept it like that, you took it out from pocket, 
it is shiny and you could get from the far mer 
whatever you want, bread and butter,
 everything, they were shaking. 
Yeah. 

Boichikes, don™t kill me , don™t kill me , I™ll give what you want. 

Okay. You said some thing about getting rifles and things, and guns and pistols.  We re you able 
to get anything else, like grenades? 
Yeah. 
Where did you get the grenades from? 
See, when the Germans destroyed the Russian 
army, they dropped everything on the fi elds. 
The Russians did?  
Yeah.  The ma jor population, they picked 
from the field whatever they wa nted. 
They had grenades? 

They had plenty. 

Oh, I see.  Okay. 

Some  of them were communists, leftist sympathizers.
  They gave us for free, just to help us.  
You know what I mean?   Some  wa nted money. 
Why don™t you tell me  a little bit about how
 you got involved with the partisans? 
How?  

Did you get involved with the partisans wh
ile you were in the ghetto or after? 
I™m telling you when I was in the ghetto there was still no partisans.  We met a Russian, I 
me ntioned before, we met a Russian in our to
wn, he brought logs, wood to sell and we got 
acquainted with him, and he was a lieu
tenant, and that™s when it started. 
I reme mber the first me e ting we had a friend of 
mi ne and he was afraid too.  It was a short 
meeting and he told us we  should start to ge
t weapons.  And that when we started to buy 
weapons and we used to bring it over (?
) about six kilome ters from our town. 
In the woods? 
In the woods. 
Do you remember the date, roughly, about when that was when you had that first me e ting? 

Yeah.  It was cool, we were buying a lot of wood for 
the winter.  It must be
 in October, October. 
In 1942 or?  

1941.  We  still di dn™t have a ghetto. 

Oh, so this meeting took place before the ghetto. 
Before the ghetto.  The ghetto started January 
1942.  Thank God, I still 
reme mber dates.  You 
know a lot of town people still call me , when 
was the shooting, when was the ma ssacre?   And 
when did they take us in that
 ghetto?  They are younger than 
me  and they don™t reme mber any 
dates. 
You reme mber them all? 

I reme mber them. 
You got a good me mory. 
I™m bad to reme mber name s.  It™s funny th
ing, how a brain works.  I™m not so good in 
me morizing names. 
But you know numbers? 
Dates. 

You said there were about eight people who were
 involved in getting these weapons.  They were 
all involved with this Pa rtisan person?   The pe
rson you had the meeting with.  Did they all know 
him?  

I don™t believe they all know hi m.
  I don™t reme mber exactly how ma ny of us were at the meeting 
firstŠthree or four.  But then we took in mo
re boys, we needed more.  We were not afraid 
because there were no infor mers, like in Hebrew 
we call it ﬁAmussianﬂ (?).  We were neighbors, 
we knew him. 
How many Germans, like either S.S. or German army
 persons were in the town at this time?   Do 
you reme mb er? 
(344)  Not ma ny, there were about
 eight, nine Germans and the re
st were local militia, black 
uniforms. 
Was there a larger German contingent 
some where in the area, not far away? 
In Novogrudek (Navahrudak, Belarus). Yeah, Minkat 
(?  Nothing found) was 
over there...?  (379). 
Why don™t you describe  for me  a little bit about 
more go on with what you were doing in the 
ghetto collecting these weapons, 
and then when I guess, when you escaped, or they took you to 
Novogrudek (Navahrudak, Belarus). 

You want the whole story? 
Sure, give it to me , give me  the whol e story. 
We got in touch with another Russian guy, a 
Russian pilot who was working for some body in 
our town. 

About what time was this now, was this about th
e same  ti me  we were talking about before? 
We were about 1942, we were in th
e ghetto already.  That was our 
biggest mi stake.  Even that 
lawyer, and he said we should st
ay in touch with him because I saw him once with a gun in the 
pocket.  And then I became  suspicious.  I said how can you walk around with a gun in the 
pocket?   In other words, he had a permit?  Voretsky 
didn™t realize it, that la
wyer.  He betrayed us. 
The lawyer did? 
No, no, the Russian pilot. 
The Russian pilot.  O.K. 
He betrayed us. 
He betrayed you to whom?   Who di d he tell?   The Germans ?  
See what can happen.  We had a meeting in front 
of, we we ren™t ma rried by that time, we were 
young kids, we went to school togeth
er and we were friends.  We
 are standing in front of her 
house in the ghetto and the sla
ughterhouse, you had to go through the ghetto, the gentiles, in 
order to reach the slaughter house.  So he wa
s working for one who was ma king the provisions, 
you know, non-kosher.  Walking back he stopped and sa
id that he had in th
e village, promising 
some body t wo revolvers and grenades, and I woul
d like one of you should go with me.  And not 
the whole group was standing.  It was me , a
nd Sholom Pyolin (Sholom Pyolun and Ohat 
Zukotun? ) , three or four of us.  Until now I can™t
 understand why did he pick that Sholom Pyolun 

(? ).  He was a refugee from Poland and he moved 
in our town.  He ran away from the Nazis.  A 
small boy.  He picked him because he  was not from our town and he said to him, Sholom 
[Russian words You will go with me ] (? ) (420). 
It means, you™ll go with 
me .  And we  all going 
to meet over there in ________ and I™ll wait fo
r you.  He was a brave guy, my friend, Sholom 
Pyolun.  It was warm, i t  was summ
er.  It was six, seven in the ev
ening, the sun was still shining a 
little bit.  He said goodbye to us and he went st
raight over the fields in
 the meadows in that 
direction.  She was working for the Nazis clean
ing their building over 
there and she was going 
into a little room where she had the brooms a
nd the mop and everything.  She opened up the door 
she sees that Russian guy jump out of the wi
ndow because he  saw her.  The guy who betrayed 
us.  So she realized right away that he is a spy. 
 But she couldn™t stop the work to tell us.  They 
would kill her, the Nazi s. 
That™s right. 
The mo ment she finished her work and she cam
e back home, she call me , ﬁAaron, I saw Vanya 
over there.ﬂ  His name  was Vanya.  Oye, I said we  are in trouble.  We  
couldn™t call him back 
because he was gone, and he was waiting, the Ge rmans ma de an ambush and they caught him 
alive, and they brought him in our 
town.  See the story?   A tragedy. 
What did they do after that?   Wh
at did the Germans do after that? 
They tortured him to death in prison. 
Oh my gosh.  Now this is your friend, th
is is not the Russian guy they tortured? 
No, no.  Wh at happened to the Russian guy fr
om then on, we don™t know, he disappeared. 
But the guy who went across the field, your 
friend, was the one who was tortured. 
Yes. 

Do you know where they took him?  
He went to ma ny places and I think they got the guns and the grenades, but on the way back they 
caught him with the grenades, they had proof, 
you know what I mean, with the grenades and 
everything.  So he was arrested, lik
e I told you, they tortured him to death, but he didn™t give any 
name s.  He didn™t give any name s of us.  A Je
wish guy was going to get water from the well and 
he found that little note, he
 threw out the little window. 
From where he was being tortured? 
From the prison, yeah. 
Wow.  So the Germans basically, they knew that 
there was some  sort of plan going on, but they 
didn™t know who it was? 
They knew, yes.  It was in the evening, a frie
nd of mi ne in the same  group, come s over my house 
and he says, ﬁAaron, we have to run away becau
se they uncovered the underground organization.  
And, come  on, that lawyer and the rest of the 
boys were waiting in 
the main Schule inŠthe 
ladies.ﬂ  You know, in Europe, the ladies were 
services having on the top separate, not the me n 

together, it was an orthodox Shul.  ﬁOver there 
they™re a hiding, and ma ke it fast, we have to 
retreat, we have to go.ﬂ  And then I had a tr
agic mome nt.  My mother and father came overŠ
ﬁyou are leaving us in a tragic mo me nt like now
?  You run away to save your life and you leave 
us alone?ﬂ  I say, ﬁMommy, I am not  trying to save 
my life, we are going to die anyway.  I want 
to fight, I wa nt to die in battle, I want to take
 a couple of Germans with me  in the grave, but I 
don™t want to go alive in the grave.
ﬂ  It didn™t help.  
And there was another reason that I couldn™t 
go.  If I would go away, I wouldn™
t report to work the next day 
so the Germans woul d kill my 
parents anyway.  They would know 
right away that I disappeared.  So I said to my friend, ﬁI am 
not going.  I don™t want that on my c onscience, 
they should kill my parents, my sister and 
brothers.ﬂ  They said goodbye to me .  They went 
away, they ran away that night from the ghetto.  

They came in the woods, they me t, there was a 
small group of Russian partisans, but he was 
intelligent so he became the comma nder.  A coupl
e weeks later, I ran aw
ay too, for a couple of 
nights, and I came back and it was quiet, nobody ever
 looked for me , for my
 other friend and that 
Russian guy disappeared.  They sent him away 
some where, I don™t believe they killed him, the 
sent him away in another town. 
To do some thing some where else. 
Yeah.  So I™ll go in another instance.  I was 
working like nothing would happen, but over there 
one Sunday the Russian partisan went to the vill
age, they had a good time with the girls.  They 
were drinki ng, became high, intoxicated and they
 opened up a fire and started yelling, ﬁKill the 
Jew and save Russia.ﬂ  An old slogan _______ (501).  
They killed that Boretskafy (?) (502), that 
lawyer, they killed two, three, four and the rest  escaped. 

This was in the ghetto?   They killed people in
 the ghetto?  Is that where they killed them? 
No.  In the partisans (?).  They killed my frie
nd, that lawyer, and the other boys that joined him. 
Oh, the otherŠoh, I see.  I understand now, Oka y. 

They were anti-Semites, you know what I mean? 
Why don™t you go ahead and tell me  some  more.  
So, now you™re still in
 the ghetto, you didn™t 
escape.  You decided not to escape because you di
d not want to endanger your fa mily.  What did 
you do after that? 
I was still working power station. 
How long did you work there? 
I worked ther e until the massacre. Until 
they killed all the Jewish people. 
Which was when? 
August the 6
th
 of 1942. 
Why don™t you explain that, tell me  about that. 
About what? 
About August 6
th
. 

It was four o™clock in the morning and we s
uddenly hear people runn
ing.  We looked in the 
window, we ™re asking them what happened?   We
 are surrounded by the Germans.  A lot of 
Germans all around the town. 
So now these were Germans who weren™
t in the town before?  They came– 
No, armi es, regular army, a lot of
 them.  A lot were Lithuanians,
 murderers.  They came  with 
rolled up sleeves like butchers, and drunk, and they 
told us to come  to th
e ma rket, the center of 
the town.  They had also another excuse, they
 wanted to check the ﬁArbisheinﬂ (?) (541). 
The workplace or whatever? 

Like a document that you are working. 
Right, work papers? 
Yes.  So we came together in th
e center of the to
wn, and then when they got all of us, they took 
usŠthey chased us like cattle 
near the Jewish ceme tery.  The second one.  We  had an old 
cemetery and that was the newer one.  And they 
brought us near the cemetery and they gave us 
an order to lay down face down.  We  were surrende
red to Germans.  Whoever tried to escape the 
ghetto, was killed right away.  Th
ere were three lines of Ger mans.
  Three rings.  Know what I 
mean?  And then they star ted call 
skilled people and they warned us 
not to lift the head.  If they 
ask for carpenter, raise your hand but keep your 
nose in the ground.  So they called carpenters, 
blacksmiths, and here and there and I say to myself
, I knew from my father that during the war, a 
shoema ker and a tailor wa s the best trade.   I sa
id to myself, what do they need an electrician, 
machinist?   So when they were calling for shoema
kers, I raise my hand.  He told me to lift my 
head.  When they have to lift your head, they wa
nted to see your age. 
 If you are too young, they 
didn™t take you.  So then he poked you with the ri
fle, they hit you in the back.  Get up and run 
over there, face down.  And then my father the sa
me  way and that™s all 
from my family.  So 
officially they were supposed to live.  We  
found out later on that about 120 people take to 
Novagrudek to that forced labor camp. 
That™s where they took them?  
Yes, but they took us to the movies.  They packed
 us in the movies and 
during the next couple of 
days they found a lot of Jewish people hidi ng and the movie was filled up.  That™s when she 
came out with her family.  She was hiding too.  So they accumulated instead of 120, there was 

ma ybe a thousand.  So then when they tried to
 pick who should live and who should die again.  
And then when the German pulled her out and 
saw she is a good tailor, see I™m coming to the 
point, and the rest they put us in 
trucks and took us to railway stat
ion and then they put us in the 
train and they took us to a 
camp.  A forced labor camp. 
How long, or how far from your town is Novagrudek? 
Thirty-five kilome ters.  Wi re
s and you know, the rings (? ). 
Barbed wire. 
Yeah.  Barbed wires and on each corner on towers was they were standi ng with machine guns. 

The people who they didn™t choose to take 
to the work camp, what happened to them?  
They took them, they we nt to the left and they shoot them. 
They shot them?  
They shot them.  They took them back to the same cemetery.  There was a big grave, mass grave, 
that the gentiles are digging.  They
 never told us.  I have good fr
iends, Polacks, a kilome ter and a 
half from my town and they never came to tell a 
Je w, that run away they are digging graves for 
you.  It was so secret that nobody 
knew anything.  And that™s in 
a big pit, a big grave where 
2,500 Jewish people ma y be.   We  had two ma ss acr
es.  One was in April 1942 and they killed 

old people and widows. 
In April of 1942? 
Yes, they killed 800. 

They just killed people they couldn™t send to a work camp? 
The first massacre was justŠthey called it, they 
couldn™t work, useless people it was for them. 
Why don™t you tell me  a little 
bit about Nova (_______________________)   
But it wasn™t  a cattle train?  But, also it wasn
™t a passenger train?   It
 didn™t have seats. 
I think it was, benches on the side.  But they
 squeezed us in so ma ny people you couldn™t sit 
anyway. 
Right. 

 Like sardines. 
That™s what I wanted to know, if it was the same  as
 most train rides that I™
ve heard about.  O.K., 
go ahead.  I™m sorry I interrupted you.  Go 
ahead and tell me  about Novagrudek (?). 
So when I was taken they dropped us in the wo
rking camp, I said to myself, Oh, my God, how 
will we escape from here?   The first thing wa
s I was looking around, how the fences were ma de 
and if there was any chance to escape.  
What did you think when you came in and saw th
at?   Did it look like it wa s promising that 
ma ybe you c ould escape? 
No.  I became  very pessimi stic.  Very pessimi
stic because it was a small place and the police 
were standing with machine guns 
all around in the towers.  I was 
there a few days and the camp 

was, before we came over there, there were 
people there already from
 the same town, from 
Novagrudek, the natives 
were already there. 
So the camp was outside of the town of Novagrudek? 
It was a still town.  It used to be Koht/calle
d (?) (650) Poland, big build
ing.  So, they made a 
carpenter shop, a shoemaker shop and the villagers
 used to come  and bring work, the Jewish 

people used to do all that work.  I noticed that 
every day six Jewish people are being picked out 
without writing down name s, you jus t  counted si
x Jews are going with horse and wagon to 
ghetto, because there was still a gh
etto in Novagrudek.  They were baking bread for the forced 
labor camp.  So every day there used to go six 
people and when they came back the police were 
counting six Jews.  They didn™t care 
Aaron, Jack, no name s, just numbers. 
As long as they had six? 
We realized it, we said to ourselves, from th
e ghetto would be a good chance to escape, because 
there™s just a picket fence and that™s it.  So 
we organized.  There was____ was in charge of our 
people from our town.  So we asked him he should
 pick out six from our guys and send us to the 
ghetto.  There were Jewish people from the ghettowho wanted to come  to the forced labor camp 
because they believe d there was a be tter chance to 
survive in the forced labor camp.  So we went 
six over there, we sent six people from the ghetto
 with the horse and wagon with the bread.  Next 
day the other group, my friends, came another six.  
So you were shifting people into the ghetto? 
So we were 12 already.  And another six came 
in the horse and wagon.  And in nighttime , we 
found over there they gave us a 
shovel in the ghetto we dug ho
les, cat and dog (? ).  Now a 
policeman was patrolling.  But the fence in the 
ghetto was long, so when he started out on that 
corner until he come s over there and back, 
so we dug a hole some where here under the bushes 
and as soon as __ passed us, one by one we w
ould jump out and we escaped all 12 of us. 
Now is this ghetto similar to the one 
in your town?   The one in Novagrudek? 
It was a higher fence, that was the difference. 
 Wood, anyway.  No barbed wire, it was a fence, 
that™s all. 

At this point you then went into the woods? 
We had a good guy.  One guy, one of my friends, 
he was a carpenter, was working in the 
villages, that™s why he was a good guy.  By tw
o o™clock we we re far away by a lake.  I 
reme mber, I was so nervous, the tongue was so dry, stiff, we _______.  It took us two weeks to 
reach the partisans.  We  knew where to go, we 
are not afraid even we knew there were anti-
Se mites and they killed some  people, we had no 
other choice and we were so surprised we came 

over there, we found a lot of Jewish people.  
They run out from the hiding places under the 
floors, under the houses and everybo
dy knew where to go.  That™s when we join them.  By the 
end of the summer, ™42, we were around over a 
100 boys from our town.  We  had mo re than 
200,000 bullets, we had machine guns, we had rifles. 
You said it took you two weeks?   
Wa s that traveling mostly th
rough the woods to get to the 
Partisans?  
Yes. 

How did you get food and things? 
From the far mers.  One of our friends had a litt
le revolver.  For ladies
, a little one with two 
bullets, that™s all we had.  And I told you we had a 
cigarette holder so we us
ed to keep it like that 

and they were shivering.  We  were boys, take 
a bread, cheese, milk.  On the way to the woods, 
we were looking for Jewish people, we knew 
where Jewish people were
 hiding.  My friend™s 
father was in the village and we found him.  
So you just collected th
ese people and took them? 
Yes.  We  took them with us in the woods. 

O.K., why don™t you describe to me  about the organization and the leaders of the partisan group 
and what you did with the part
isans.  What you were doing? 
Well, the fi rst summer, our main objective was to 
arm a lot of Jewish people, there wa s a lot of 
Jewish people.  We  were just a Je
wish fighting group in the beginning. 
In order to do that, what did you do? 
Well, we used to buy, we used to go to friends, a lo
t of Jews had friends in 
the villages.  They are 
buying from Jewish people in town, you know, cust
omers.  Asking for grenades or weapons.  
The problem was that we were not trained sold
iers.  I was too young for the Polish army, I was 
not kosher for the Russian army.  They didn™t wa
nt to take me because my uncle was fighting 
against the communists in 1920.  My father was a bi
g shot in our town, they didn™t trust me .  We  
had actually ma ybe five or ten percent professional
 soldiers who were in the Polish army.  They 
knew how to keep a rifle.  We  didn™t know
 anything, we had to learn from a-b-c. 
So they trained you? 

They trained, you had to learn yourself.  For 
instance, I found, we used to see on the fields 
standing tanks, burned down tanks, 
rotting tanks the Germans destroye
d them.  I used to take out 
the machine guns and bring them in the woods.  They were still good, but th
e springs used to be 
nailed from the fire when the tank wa s burning, so
 they were soft. It didn™t work with the 
machine gun, so I took the springs and I used to heat 
it up in the fire flame and wrap it in oil to 
temper it.  Sometimes I succeeded and someti mes not.  That™s the way we used to make machine 
guns put together from three to one.  You know what I mean? 
So basically that™s what you did, you were ...? 
Because I am a machinist, 
it was in my field already. 
So you collected weapons or whatever you could use. 

This is still the summer of 42?   Wha t  kind of 
operations did you carry ou
t?   Did you, like, try to 
fight or attack any Germ
an places or anything? 
From beginning in November 42, we had the first 
fight.  In the center of our forest, there was a 
village and they sent in Ukrainians and Germans a
nd they ma de outpost, they call it.  They call it 
a garrison, outpost.  And they sent us in a lette
r we should surrender, get rid of the Jews, the 
Jewish people, they were writing lik
e to the gentiles.  So they got an answer, if you™ll hit us with 
the clean bullets, we™ll cure it
, but if our rusty bullets ar
e going to hit you, you™ll die from 
infection.  Nobody surrendered tothem.  And there was not, we were not under one command.  

Every group was for himself.  It was no good.  So
me ti me s we were fighting each other too.  It 

was no good.  But we had to destroy the Germans.  We  got united under one command.  And it 
was one mor ning, I reme mber, in November and we
 had two tanks that the Russian boys fixed 
them, but the Russian army left them.  It had tires
 like a car, it is made 
out of steel and a little 
cannon, you know what I mean? 
Like an armored transport? 
Yeah. 
Some thing like that? 

The top turns like in a tank, 
a little one.  We  had two 
of them and we __________ (736). 
Where did you hide those?   Did 
you hide those in 
the woods also? 
In the woods.  The woods were about 4 x 4 kilo
me tersŠit was pretty big.  And we had two big 
rivers, the Ye nnen(?) that flows into the Baltic Se
a.  So we attack in one, a Russian lieutenant 
officer killed only.  We  destroyed 
them, our first fight.  We  t ook a 
lot of trophies.  That™s the way 
we could help our Jewish people who lived, a lot 
of groups lived in the woods.  Whole families.  
Husbands, wives and childre n who survive.  So we gave them one quilt to coverŠbig beds, the 
kitchen was cooking for the soldiers, we took aw
ay the horse with the 
kitchen and a lot of 
bullets, rifles, a lot of trophies.  But we did it 
a couple time s more, then we got an order from 
Moscow not to do it anymore. 
To stop?  
To stop because one partisan™s life is more impor
tant than 100 Germans.  But what they wanted 
us to do is hit and run, hit and run.  You couldn™t 
keep up a long fight with the Germans.  Like I 
had 50 bullets, how long can you fight?   Oh, and 
by that time came an order to split up the 
Jewish group.  See Stalin, he didn™t trust the Jewi
sh group.  We couldn™t resi
st.  They were in the 
thousands and we were a few hundred.  So they 
split us up.  Part of us
 between the gentiles. 
O.K. when t hey split you up, where did you go? 
In the same forest. 
You stayed there? 
Yeah, a couple of kilometers there was another 
group.  So the first dama ge we tried to do the 
Germans, we burned down all the bridges.  The 
transportation, they would drive the trucks.  
Telephone lines we used to cut down.  Then we 
started learning the rail trains.  That wa s the 
most important thing. 
How did you do that? 

There was a Ukrainian ca ptain and he  had a Jewi
sh wife.  Wh en anti-Semitism was very high in 
the woods, a group of Russian, there was a ma jorŠwh
at was his name?   I still reme mb er him.  
He had a lot of Jewish people with him from Rus s
ia.  He was a communist.  When he heard what 
was going on, anti-Semi tism, and was killed, and so
 forth.  All the partisans were called in one 
place and he give an orde r, if you kill one Jew, will 
be  killed all of you, it™s an order.  We have to 

kill Germans, we came to fi ght our enemy.  It quieted down.  So, I™ll come to the point.  That 
Ukrainian captain, called me .  He said I he
ard you are a very handy boy, you know electrical 
work.  Would you like to make mi nes 
in the rail trains?   I said right
 away, ﬁsure.ﬂ  He said to me , 
ﬁlay down.ﬂ  It™s summer  time in the tents. 
 I reme mber laying on the ground, he took out the 
piece of paper and a pencil and he made a sketch.  What we needed was a detonator and a battery 

and a big shellŠa 125 millimeter shell he gave me. 
 And he  said,  ﬁHere go ma ke it.ﬂ  I picked 

three or four Jewish guys, my fr
iend who lives in Houston, Texas, 
Morris Abrams, he still is over 
there, and we went to a group over there living 
in the woods.  What I needed was plywood to 
ma ke a little box.  So I ma de up the box and I ma
de everyt hing with a 
battery, with a button 
sticking out just to go under the 
rail and we went not far away, about 20 kilome ters from us was 
running a train from Le mberg (L™v
iv, Ukraine) to Vilna.  From
 south Poland up to the north, 
north Lithuania.  And one boy was watching th
e Germans on one side and one boy was and the 
other one we toOkay our coats to cover up because 
I had to turn on a flashlight.  You have to see 

what you are doing, otherwise you would e
xplode and you™ll get your ____________ (787).  
And I put in mi ne, you have to be very caref
ul because you have to put detonator four 

millimeters under the rail.  When the train come
s, the weight of the train se ttles eight 
millimeters, it sinks.  So you had room only four millimeters.  The most dangerous thing.  So 

when I ma de it and then we put 
in the shell, I reme mber we dug a big hole.  Now you have to 
keep the di rt, not leave a ma rk that you dug the dirt because the Germans are walking back and 

forth.  So we left the gravel, everything is put 
aside.  And when I put 
it in the ground then I put 
with the chisel I made a little 
hole in the shell and I put in th
e detonator and carefully cover up 
with the dirt and put back the gravel, we cove
red it up and we run away
 in the woods.  About 
three kilome ters, two kilome ters we lay down, we ™re waiting.  Eleven o™clock in the morning, I 

should live, I still reme mber 11 
in the morning, we hear chug, c
hug, the train is comi ng.  In our 
territory it used to go slow, in the beginning it used
 to go fast, but since we 
started to derail them, 
they got smart, the Germans, they go slow becau
se the dama ge is smaller when you go slow, like 
40 miles, but it used to go 80.  And suddenly, we h
eard an explosion.  We  were so glad, my first 
successful job.  So, in the night we
 went to the village and the gent
iles said, what happened?   So 
they told us it was the train with medication. 
Oh, no. 

And three cars jumped down, not a
ll of them, thr ee, three cars.  So by the same  ti me , the train 
was destroyed, dama ged and it would take a week to
 fi x it, so it slowed down the supplies to the 
battlefield.  That was my first 
job.  The second successful job wa
s we were sent to the Third 
Reich.  You know part of Poland was next to Germany?  
Right. 
________ was Germany, over there it was very hard 
to fight because the population was mostly 
Polacks.  Over there we were walking two days
 and finally we  came over there, we were very 
lucky we had a very good guide.  I still can™t  under
stand how come  he knew so well our terr itory.  
He was a Russian.  He was living like Moshe Ra
binim (sp.), the Jewish people from Egypt.  And 
I™ll make it short, we derailed thre
e trains over there too.  Two with 
shells and one with gasoline.  
Because two groups went over there before us and 
never came back they were killed over there.  
And we were lucky, we came back.  We had a lo
cal paper in the woods, they were writing about 
me  operating.  In the worst circumstances I used
 to clean my  ma chine gun, I had a machine gun.  
It wasn™t rust y because  when we came back, th
e White Polacks were shooting at us.  So my 

machine gun was working and I opened fire on 
them.  And I kept my ma chine gun in good 
shape. 
So it worked when you needed it? 
So how long, so, you were with the Pa
rtisans until the end of the war? 
I was, we were liberated by the Russian army in July 1944. 
So July of 44 you, did they ma ke you go in the arm
y, is that what they did?   The Red Ar my.  So 
you were kind of incorporated into the army. 
We were incorporated, they didn™t ask us. 
Did you want to go, did you not want to do that? 
Actually, we were bitter with them.  I™ll 
tell you why.  We  were living under abnorma l 
conditions.  We had all kind of skin diseases. 
 Some ti me s you wear underwear for four, five 
weeks.  We  had, excuse me , lice and all the hell.  
And they didn™t let us to go back to the town to 
a bath to wash ourselves and cha
nge the clothing.  They took us ri
ght away to the battlefield and 
did not give us a chance to rest two, three 
days.  That was what
 we were angry at. 
O.K.  Did you see any action whil
e you were in the Red Army befo
re the end of the war?   Did 
you fight against the Germans?  
Did I see action? 
Yes.  We re you involved in battles? 
In the Red Ar my, the Russian army ?   Sure.  It didn™
t take long and we were 
fighting in Bialystok.  
We knew that the Germans were going to start the 
next morning and offensive.  And they, I went 
to artillery.  When I saw that 
infantry is just cannon meat, fl
esh, so they were looking for 
artilleries, so I raised my hand and I went over 
there.  We  were standi
ng battery, four of us, 
suddenly we hear the German tanks in the morni
ng.  And they were moving slowly, slowly and 
we open up a fire with our cannons.  The shells were
 too small.  We  used the biggest tanks, tiger 
and panther.  Like one family houses, so big.  
And that™s what they were waiting for.  The 
mome nt they saw us shooting, they opened up the 
fire on us.  We were four times six, twenty-
four, all of them were killed.  
Me and three Russian boys survived.  That was my first battle.  
And I had shrapnel in my temple, right here. 
O.K. 
That was my first battle, then
 we were fighting continuously. 
Could you tell us at this point, 
did you know the Germans, could you tell that they were losing 
the war?   You know what I mean, that the war seemed to be going bad for the Germans at this 
point, or was that not evident? 
I think they knew it.  They didn™t have any more
 airplanes, seldom you s a w an airplane because 
they lost a lot of airplanes over England, and we 
were not afraid of them anymore.  But you still 
had to watch out.  They were very good fighters,
 the Germans.  They started a couple contra-

offensives and they wounded a lot of our boys an
d they killed a lot of our boys.  And we had a 
very heavy fi ght in Poland, in Solinka.  Oh what
 a fight we had over there.  The big river, the 
river was name d Solinko.  We  crossed the bridge 
and we had just a platform.  Two kilome ters 
deep and ma ybe five in the width.  And the Germ
ans are shooting at us and it was just like an 
earthquake, like an earthquake.  Af
ter a nice couple of hours it qui
eted down.  My lieutenant and 
the guys were hiding in the trenches.  And when
 I searched for the little wi ndow in each cannon, 
when I looked and I saw the Germans running, I became wild.  I said, now I have a moment to 
take revenge.  And I™m yelling 
to the window to bring up shel
ls, they were hanging and we 
couldn™t hear each ot her.  Because from the ai
rplanes and the bombs and everythi ng, it was 
terrible.  So I was carrying myself the shells 
and shooting them so much that the paint on the 
cannon was burning, believe me , s moke was comi ng out.  Wh en it was quiet down, two boys, 

Russian young soldiers, 18 years old, kids, come  
over to me, I should help them to take out 

Germans, surrounding the white flag from the trenc
h.  I said I have no right to leave my cannon.  
They said it™s your job, infantry, go take them. 
 So I see them standing and talking, so I stood up 
too because I was on my  knees.  I could hear ma
ny times bullets hi tting the spires, it ma kes a 

ﬁ Whooooﬂ,  it™s singing.  What I s
ee, I thought the Germans were 
running away.  The mome nt I 
stood up, knocked me  a bullet here, through and th
rough, and I fell like a rock.  I was wounded 

in the hospital and I was taken from the battlefield. 
It mi ssed your heart? 
That™s what the doctor told me .  Mendel was foll
owing you.  Right here it went in my blade and 
my shoulder. 

And you we re in the hospital for a month? 
A month. 
And then they put you right back out? 

Yes.  Then they sent me  to the military school. 
 I was a month in the military school and I came 
out I was a sergeant and I was a commander of a cannon. 
Where was the military sc hool? 
Not far fr om the battlefiel d. 
And then you came back as a sergeant? 
Yes.  (Wi fe:  He won a lot of me dals.) 

Do you still have the me dals? 
It™s a long story.  I deserted in Russia, in Po
land we lost, we were going back to Russian, I 
deserted so I throw away all my me dals, 
who needs it, because the __________ (911) were 
looking for me  all over the town.  I was 
running from one house to another. 
So you™ve been wounded and you go in the hospital 
and you™re back on the battlefield, about 
what time was this, when was this?   Late ‚44, early ‚45, do you reme mber ? 

No that was ‚44 it was still warm, it was ma ybe in September, because end of September, ma ybe. 
Can you tell me  a little b
it about the end of the war?   Asthe war starts to wind down, did you go, 
did you rema in–? 
I will try to make it shorter becau
se you can talk another week if I have to tell you everything.  
We  go to central  Poland, northern Berlin, and we 
came in East Prussia and we split in half and 
we came out  to the Baltic Sea, near Koenigsberg 
(Kaliningrad, Russia).  H
eavy fights over there.  
Germans resisted, we were arrested in four days 
and then they threw us over into Germany, like I 
said, north of Berlin and soon Berlin fell, the re
sistance was very weak already.  And slowly we 
were moving on and mo ving on and it was dangerous because  the German army fell apart.  So 
you could hear Germans talking in the front of you, 
in the back of you.  We were scared, so we 
couldn™t slee p even.  But I was fi ghting until we came close to the American army.  I actually 

didn™t see because I was in the artillery.  I wasn™t 
on the first line.  I™m glad I was privileged to 
have the opportunity to fight against Nazi Germa
ny.  As a Jew, I didn™t regret one mi nute for the 
blood I was spilling.  Because I took revenge fo
r my fa mily and for the six million Jewish 
people. 
Do you remember the day when the war ende
d, where you were?   What you were doing when 
you heard the war was over? 
I™m telling you, in Germany. 
So you were right outside Berlin? 

West of Berlin.  Yes. 
Can you tell me a little bit 
what you did after the war? 
After the war, we were going back to Russia.  
In Lodz was parade; a general was standing, there 
was a big parade.  While we were ma rching I look
 sideways, I see the people are jump ing on the 
sidewalk, wa ving hands, ________ (951)  on I turn 
my head, and I look, my ex-friend passes, 
they recognized me , they recognized me  waving th
eir hands.  What can I do, it is a parade.  But 
there was a lieutenant in charge of us, ma rc
hing first, he was young.  I said to him comr ade 
lieut enant, I want information to 
get out.  He said what happened?  
 I said to him I see my friend 
over there and they are jumping, he said go, catch 
up with them and I never saw me  again.  They 
told me  wha t  goes on in Russia about anti-Semitism
.  And my wife and my father were still over 
there.  They told me  send a telegram and come  ov
er.  They never got my telegram.  I had a lot of 
the _______________ (963) looking for me .  I had to wait for them until Nove mber.  (Wi fe:  

Excuse me , we came looking for him, in town, as
k for him, ac tually we don™t know.  I ask how is 
he doing, how is he feeling, he said he™s good, he™s 
fine.)  But he knew I deserted.  So finally we 
came, I sent a letter and that letter reached them 
on my military address.  They made papers.  As 
Polish immi grants, they couldn™t leave Russia.  
So they came to Lodz and they found me  and I 
got in connection with a guy, a 
friend of mi ne, took us by tr
uck to Berlin, we came to 
__________ (976) to Germany by train and from there 
to Berlin.  I registered with the UNRRA 
and they took us in big American trucks, they
 brought us to Ha mburg in Germany and over there 
an American lieutenant came out and said now 
you are a free people and go wherever you want.  
So I knew a couple of townspeople are in _____ near
 Frankfurt am Main, so I went to them and 

settled and then we got in touch with my relatives in America and Canada and they sent to us a 
visa and in 1947 we came here.  June 1947. 
Have you been in New York all that time ?  
Yes. 
When did you get ma rried? 

Here, in 1947. 
She was with me all the 
time with the partisans. 
You were with the par
tisans also?   So you were in the woods also? 
All the time. 

People here can™t be lieve it.  They sa y they can ma
ke a movie out of it.  For awhile we went to 
the same  school, free tuition, a governme nt school.
  A cousin of mi ne with the same  name  
sneaked in in the camp in Grudack.  I still can™t 
understand how could he sneak in with a cut-off 
rifle and he sneaked in under the wires, at night
 we were sleeping, he sn
eaked in.  How could he 
come  over there.  He was 17 years old, a young kid.  
He had a father over there too.  He told us 
what was going on and he run away and he came to the woods. 
Well, I think I™ve asked all my questions.  Is ther
e anything else you want to say before I cut off 
the tape? 
Like I said, I™m proud of myself, I have so 
ma ny wounds, a wound  in my leg, a bullet in my 
heart.  I had some thing wrong with my nose, I we
nt to the doctor he took 
x-rays he said, ﬁMr. 
Laro, you know you have a piece of me tal in your h
ead? ﬂ   I think for a wh
ile and I said, oh, that 
must be when I fought in Bialyst
ok.  I still have it, I feel it.  
He said, ﬁIf it don™t bother you, leave 
it alone.ﬂ 
That™s great.
