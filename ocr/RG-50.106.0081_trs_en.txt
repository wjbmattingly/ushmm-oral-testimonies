Bella Pasternak
, condus Œ conducted by 
Esther Finder
, on October 22
nd
, 1997, in 
Rockville
,
 Mary land
. This is a follow-
up interview to a 
United States
 
Holocaust 
Memorial Museum 
videotape interview conducted with 
Bella Pasternak
 on April 
21
st
, 1994. This is tape
 number one, side 
A
. I™d like to start by asking you about 
your liberation experience. What was th
e mo ment of liberation like for you? 
Answer: Well, we got liberated by the Ru
ssians. We didn™t know anything til the 
lagerfuehrer 
came in and told us we are freed. 
We didn™t hear no noises, nothing. 
The Œ the older 
SSs
 left, and we were surrounded only by the 
lagerfuehrer
, who 
was from 
Czechoslovakia
, a girl, a Jewish girl. So we
 really don™t know anything 
much about it. But the ru-ru-R
ussian government declared 
it liberated, and that™s all 
wa Œ we knew 
[indecipherable]
. 
Q: When  you heard that you we
re free, that you were liberated, what did that mean 
to you? 

A: We were in a small town. Because we 
were on the front line, we were given the 
ammunition for the soldiers. So we were in a 
farm, in a Œ in a stable full of hay, that 
we slept in. And when they
 came in and said we got 
liberated, everybody start 
running. This is the way it 
started. That was January 21
st
, winter, cold, and we were

shivering in a barn. The first thing peopl
e went, and they were looking for food. 
Everybody grabbed what they 
find in the farm. They trie
d to get the milk from the 
cow, because the farmers just had left when 
we got there. The first thing that we did 
was we Œ by the time we realized that ther
e is no more food left, I grabbed a little 
pig ru nning in the stable. I took a fork, one
 that i Œ cleaning th e stables, and we 
punched into  the pig, and with everything 
in it, we made a fi Œ bonfire and we sat 

down , about 10 - 12 girls with potatoes 
and that™s what was our first meal. 
Everybody was first laughing. I took my  
belt and I tie it around th e pig after I 
caught him, and I start to make a bonfire.
 So, got the heat, to warm up a little, an d 

maybe about an hour later, we all start ea
ting on th e pig. That was our first meal. 
And then we started up walking. We had 
no facilities, n o  cars, no bicycles, nothing. 
Whatever we had Œ we took 
our clothes that we had on 
us, nothing else, and we 
start going towards the city. An
d when we got to the city
, we asked the people how 
we go down south. Got liberated in 
Estonia
. And from there we walked, we start 
walking. We walked from January to Marc
h. This is the way we got home, were no 
transportation. Because we were offered 
a couple of rides from the Russians. We 
were 10 girls, we are still in touch. One 
of them Œ two of them passed away since 
then. Eight is still Œ we still talki
ng occasionally together. One is in 
Canada
, couple 
of them are in 
Brooklyn
, couple of them in 
Israel
 I just visited. And we are in

touch. The 10 of us made a group, a
nd like a chain, we jumped from one 
[indecipherable]
 to another one, because there were no bridges. And th is was the 
way we crossed the rivers. We went into ho
uses, and whatever we found, we ate. In 
certain houses, there was hot food on th e stov
e, and I told them, don™t eat, cause if 
it™s hot, there mu st be poison in it. So we
 ate raw potatoes. We were sleeping during 
the day, and we were running at night, b
ecause we were afraid of the Russians. 
They  pick ed us up once with a car, one gi
rl went up th e car and he start the mo tor 
running. So as soon as we see that they
 start rolling, we pulled her down from the 
truck. And I said, no mo re lifts, we ha
ve to walk. And there was no trains, 
everything was banned. Nothing was going. 
So the only way we were able to go 
was by foot. And wh erever got dark, we st
art running. During the day, we were 
sleeping wherever we found a 
place, in a barn, in a h
ouse. Everything was opened. 
You could go in any house, 
there was no people around
 there, until we got to 
Poland
. And then already there we ask in Po
lish, that™s all that we knew was, 
[speaks Polish here] 
Q: Translate for me, please. 
A: I don™t speak Polish either. That™s all 
Polish we know that we
 ask her, how many 
kilomete Œ kilometers is to
 the station. That™s what 
we know Polish from the Polish 
girls that we were in lager together. And th
ey said there is no station. So we kept on

walking, and we walked til March. Purim,
 just before Purim, we arriv ed to 
Budapest
. And there already, we were home,
 because we spoke th e language. We 
were able to speak Hungarian, and we as
ked the first thing if there™s a Jewish 
agency. And we were dir Œ were direct
ed because Russian ha Œ occupied  the 
territory, and they told us 
that there is a communist government there, and we 
should go to  
the office. 
Q: Did you get any assistance from the Ru
ssians along the way, after liberation? 
A: No. We were afraid to take anything
. When  we saw them on one side of the 
street, we run on the other side of the 
street, because we were afraid from them. 
They  didn™t have a very  good name to peop
le. Even after the liberation they raped a 
lot of people; we heard about it. And when  we
 tried to take a ride and a girl went in 
the truck, after then, whenever we see th
em Œ see Œ seen them on one side of the 
street, we run on the other side of the stre
et. So there was no help , or we didn™t have 
any help until we got to 
Hungary
, which was two months that we left from one 
house to another one ru nning. Then, in 
Hungary 
there already, when we got to 
Hungary
 they already called our 
[indecipherable]
 and explained them, because 
there was a couple of people 
who were in the army, and a lot of people who were in 
jail because they were
 communists. So Œ Jewish peop
le. There were a lot of them 
that they jailed them becau
se they were communists.

government came over in 
Euro pe
, they had big positions. So one called the other 
one to let him know that the Jewish people are coming back. We were, by the way, 
the first group to  arrive in 
Hungary
 from the concen tration camp . And th e greeting 
was, the dead people are coming back from the other world. 

Q: What was the state of y
our health at liberation? 
A: Well, most of us were frozen. 
To that extent that the Œ from 
Buda pest
, they took 
us by train home, and the first th
ing that they Œ I got home at 
Decs
(ph) they put us 
in the hospital, and the first 
thing they™d  give us was a ba
thtub full of ice, cause we 
were frostbitten. And that™s the Œ we were 
skinny, very Œ skeletons. Really, whe Œ if 

you look on us, they  would say really 
that the dead people
 are coming from the 
other wo rld. And we were in the hospital maybe about two weeks. There they 
checked us and they  gave 
us medication, and they gave us little by little food, til 
towards the end, after two w
eeks, they discharge us from 
the hospital. That was in 
Decs
(ph), which was a couple of miles from 
the town where we 
lived before the 
deportation.  

Q: Among the 10 people, the 
tan Œ the 10 women that you 
were with, were any of 
them from your hometown, or 
related to you in any way? 
A: We were four sister s, survived togeth
er. And th ere was one cousin, and one girl 
that my  brother used to go out before th
-the concen tration camp, and befo re the

ghetto. But when they 
met, my brother was married alre
ady, because he didn™t come 
straight home. She was a third cousin, and al
so a friend that we were together in the 
same camp. And two of them were from our 
town, and the rest of them are from the 
vicinity Œ we all 10 were from the same
 ghetto. And we were all the way to Œ 
almost all the way together. Nine were together all the w ay from Œ starting from the 

ghetto, and once my  sister we met in 
Stutthof
, where she was in a different Œ from 
a different area one. And a girl that was with
 us found her sister in the other camp. 
So they  changed their dresses at night, and 
they came to the fences. She came to us, 

and the other sister went to her, being that
 we were three, so my  sister should be 
together, we changed places with the ot
her girl. And this is the way we were 
together from September til January, til they 
liberated us. Because we were first Œ 
from 
Auschwitz
 they took us to ri Œ 
Kaiserwald
, and then there were 
Riga
, and 
from 
Riga
 to  
Stutth of
. T h en  at 
Stutthof
 we met our other sister. Cause always 
when ever you ge Œ went to
 a new camp, we ask, is 
there anybody 
from the area. 
And wh en th ey told  us who it was, we got
 to  speak through th e fence. And th rough 

the wire fence, we picked 
Œ raised the fence so they ch anged clothes, and the 
numbers, and th is way we got to gether. 
Q: When you came back to 
Budapest
, and were then taken by tr Œ by train? 
A: By train.

Q: And then put in the hospital, w
ho to ok care of you in the hospital? 
A: In Œ in the hospital they
 Œ th ey Œ already they we
re a communist organization 
and they  was running mo stly by th e Jews
 who were jailed because th ey were 
communists. They were leader
s in the government that time, and they arranged it.  
Q: Who were the doctors that cared for you? 
A: The doctors that cared for 
us were Romanian Hu ngarian,
 the ones that they Œ we 
didn™t know them because before we left
 in the lager, most of the doctors were 
Jewish, but by that time there was the govern
ment doctors because th Œ they  put in 
doctors from all over. It was a big hospital, 
still in existence now, it™s a big hospital. 
And that™s where they  put us, right there.  

Q: You mentioned that your
 group of 10 were the firs
t to come back from the 
camps. Were there any other former prisoners in the hospital with you? 
A: No. There was nobody. We were the fi
rst group that ever came back. So there 
was no other group. The only one Œ there we
re a couple of Jewish people like I said, 
they were in jail. And they were gove
rnment agencies now, because after the 
liberation that 
Russia
 took over from that pa
rt, they became offici
als. So they put us 
into the hospital and they to
ok care of us. And after them, they opened the kitchen 
for people that they start coming from ot
her countries. They came, not from the 

lagers, they came from the other part of 
Romania
, people who wanted to go to

Israel
. So they had to  go th rough that area,
 so they came to find that from the 
family. But originally
, w h en  th ey  started ,
 there was nobody else. We were the first 
ones.  
Q: During your time when you were freed 
by th e Russians, and your travel, your 
walk home, did you witness any acts of retaliation against collaborators or former 
guards from the camp s? 

A: No, we didn™t Œ we Œ we were Œ we
re running at night wh ere we didn™t see 
nothing. 

Q: Right after the war, when you were fre
ed and making your way back, was your 

view of Judaism the same as it 
had been  wh en you were a child? 
A: At that point it was still pretty strong, 
because we Œ we didn™t know that Œ we 
figure we go home and ever
ybody will come home too. We
 didn™t realize that they 
Œ they wouldn™t come back any mo re. That
 time we didn™t know nothing. We were 
together, so we figure maybe they are t
ogether someplace, and they will come 
home.  

Q: What efforts did you make to try and 
find memb ers of your fami ly, and friends? 

A: Well, the first effort we made is we we
nt home to our town and waited to see. So 
we got home in March, and April was Œ we
nt back to our town, an d we start looking 
around. The house was broke
 Œ was vacant, nothing in  it, no windows, no doors, 

 
Interview with Bella

everything was empty, nothing in the Œ in 
the stables, everything was gone. And we 
start looking around to see if anybody el
se came home. Then  we settled in the city, 
where the hospital was not far, and we™re wa
iting to see who else is coming. So the 
Œ all the effort that we had at that point
 was waiting to see, after the liberation from 
other camps to see who™s coming. And we 
waited about two or three months, then 
they start to come, one by one. A lot of 
people came from Œ to
 our town, from our 
town and from the city. From
 the ghetto th ere mu st have been about 8,000 - 8,500 
maybe, ma ybe 400 people came back all 
total. But we waited and we asked 
questions; where would Œ where 
they were, whom they seen
, and if anybody else is 
coming, and if they met anybody. So we were home that 
[indecipherable]
 my sister 
came home with us, and she found her husba
nd, who was an invalid who was in the 
army. But he got liberated be
fore, and he was home. So they met after the war, right 
away, as soon as she came to the hospita
l, he came right away, and they were 
together. But we were waiting to see who 
else will come. And from March, almost 
another year we stayed home, and we were
 waiting to see. Then
 got a letter towards 
the end, from my  brother, who w-was in 
Austria
, who said he™s waiting to see who 
else is coming because there was a big 
DP
 camp  right there, and they  had a list of 
most of the people who got liberated. Bu
t if nobody else is coming home, he 
suggests we should travel to him, or he
™s not coming back. He
 will go either to

Israel
 or to 
South America
, because Œ or to 
America
, because we had family all 
over. Before the war, my father was here. 
But for my mother™s
 family, we had a 
large group here. My grandfather™s sisters 
and brothers were he
re, and their family. 
So we knew the names, but we did not 
have no id ea the addresses, we didn™t 
remember any more. So we had written, and 
the papers, they had papers that they 
were sending overseas to see who was left 
from the family. So 
we waited til around 
March. There was a group of Polish people 
who were entertainers, and they came to 
our town for Purim in 1946. 
And after their Œ  the show, th
at they were putting up a 
show in the theater, they were saying, 
the reason we are ente
rtaining, and we™re 
going around th e country is to
 let you know th at the 
Russian people are taking 
prisoners for work. And when they™re taki
ng them, fortunately, 
the Jewish people, 
they™ll be the first one to go again. So I advise anybody who could ju st leave, the 
sooner the better. So that was Purim. So
 the next day we packed, and we start 
running. So we went towards my br
other. We figure my  brother was in 
Austria
, 
and it™s crossing the border, so see what™s 
gonna happen, we™ll meet him, we™ll see 

what decision gonna make after. So we pa
cked, and we took a couple of bottles of 

whiskey, knowing that the Russians, if they are on guard, if we give them a bottle of 
whiskey, we™ll be able to cross borders. 
Money, we didn™t have. Whatever we were 
able to put on our back, we put, and we 
left. We left, a g roup about 40. We met 

 
Interview with Bella

October 22, 1997 
 

 
 
13
from 
Decs
(ph), we went to the border, which wa
s a couple hours by train. And then 
there was a Jewish organization that was 
working to the borders
. From there they 
picked up the people to cro
ss them to the border, because there were a lot of people 
who were trying to bring th em to 
Israel
. And we were ready 
to go anyplace, to 
Israel
, to the 
State
,
 
just out of the communist group. 
So the first thin
g they took us, 
we crossed the border, and we walked ab out 40
 - 50 miles, at night too. We paid off 
the Russians with whiskey and went throu
gh 40 in  a group, with three or four 
people wh o knew the way, they
 were the leaders. And fro
m there the first thing we 
went to, went to Œ arrived to the English zone. I think it was 
Innsbruck
, or 
whatever name it was, I do
n™t remember ex actly. And the 
first thing when we went 
into the 
DP
 camp, they give us injections and th
ey give us a meal an d they put us 
up, and we were waiting to see who else is
 coming. And there was a lot of groups 
already. Every days new and 
new people used  to arrive. 
Q: I want to pause for just a minute a
nd ask you, when  you 
went back to your 
hometown, did you feel welcome by y
our former neighbors Œ non-Jewish 
neighbors? 
A: I felt welcome, but there was nothing to
 stay with. The house was empty, and 
they themselves didn™t have too mu ch. It wa
sn™t a big city, they
 were mostly very 
older people, and poor people in the Œ in 
the town. Because wher
ever it was before

the war, everything was taken away. So they
 offered us a meal, and we were there a 
day or so, then we 
went into the city. 
Q: Can you give me a time frame, when
 you left your hometown and Œ and made 
your way into 
Austria
? 
A: We left after Purim, two days after 
that group Œ I don™t know, was it March 22
nd
 
or 23
rd
, I don™t rememb er exactly the date. That
™s when we left our
 town. And I just 
get wi Œ me and my  sister and her husba
nd. My  sister got married one a Œ on th e 
[indecipherable]
 date, the time that we was there, and my  other sister had already a 
new baby, so she di Œcouldn™t leave. So 
sh e was staying home with the baby, and I 
took the key, we lock ed up the house, and 
I said, look, we are leaving. If they catch 
us, we™ll come back, we have
 the apartment. And if not,
 whatever you want to do, 
give it to somebody else. 
Q: What year are we talking about? 

A: 1946. March 1946.  
Q: You mentioned that you were in a 
DP
 camp? 
A: Yes. 
Q: In Œ 
A: I think it was 
Innsbruck
. 
Q: In 
Innsbruck
. Can you tell me Œ can you describe what the 
DP 
camp was like? 

 
Interview with Bella

15
A: There was a small 
DP
 camp, maybe 200 people. They
 had a kitchen, and they 
had bunk beds. And everybody got a blan
ket and a pillow and 
a bunk bed. And we 
were sleeping with the Œ in th
e Œ in  there it must have been
 about 20 - 30 people in a 
room. 
Q: Do you know wh ich agen cies 
provided assistance for  that 
DP
 camp? 
A: It was a n  underground ag
ency that ca Œ that came and took us to the camp. At 
that time it was the Œ the English z
one, so I don™t know which Œ i-it was 
UNRRA
, I 
don™t know what Œ what 
agency was involved, 
UNRRA
 was involved with it. 
Q: Who else was in the 
DP
 camp with you? 
A: When I left from Œ my si
ster, only my  sister with her husband was there, and 
there was a lot of people from our town th
at we still in touch. They live in the 
New 
York
 area.  
Q: Were there people from other nationalities? 

A: Oh, there were Polish people, German 
people, Fren ch people, Belgian people, 
from all the camps. And they were trying to  
get to an area to be able to go further, 
because other people did not want to 
go back home to their own town.  
Q: How did the different people get along? 
A: Pretty good. Everybody we
nt to town to find out mo
re information, and there 
they had bulletin boards. And th  Œ by th
e kitchen there was a big board that 

 
Interview with Bella

16
everybody was Œ was able to write down fo r who they  are looking and fo r wh at par 
Œ from where they coming, and anybody what
 group th ey are looking. At that point 
I put a sign that I am looking fo r the 
Weinstein
(ph) family from 
America
, if 
anybody knows where they 
are located. And I was there only maybe two or three 
weeks. My brother was in th
e American zone. He was in 
Bad Gastein
, which was a 
one night ride by train from where I was.
 So he send over Œ a couple came from 
Bad Gastein
, my  brother paid them, and another 
person. It was a husband and wife 
group, and they came with Aust
rian clothes. And my  brot
her wrote me a letter that 
somebody will visit me, cause 
he couldn™t talk on the te
lephone. And she came over 
with a letter from my brothe
r to the camp, and sh e says, my brother sent for me. 
And I got dressed in Austrian clothing, an
d I was the wife for her husband, and a 
friend of mine that I knew, 
he was supposed to be the 
husband for her. We changed. 
From one couple, they made 
two couples. Like he™s Aust
rian and I™m his wife, and 
she was Austrian and my  friend was the husba
nd. And he says, just sit in the train 
and you don™t say no
thing. And if anybody comes 
asking questions, 
make believe 
you™re sleeping and I will be dudi Œ doing 
the talking. So we took a train in the 
afternoon, and we went a co
uple hours. Then we had to stop because there was no 
train further that day. And we shared a hotel 
room that we all slept, the four of us on 
Œ on the floor in a hotel room, because 
there was no ro om. And then  the next day

17
we got dressed and we went with  
another train, and we arrived to 
Bad Gastein
. 
That place already my brother was there, 
he was married with his wife. And that 
was in a hotel. The Œ is Œ was a Œ that
 was already American zone, and it was 
[indecipherable]
 from the American organization. They had a store that people 
used to go and pick out the 
clothes. There was old clot
hes, but cleaned, and you 
registered there and you get food. But be
ing I was a outsider, I came in illegal, I 
couldn™t register. So I had a job in the kitche
n that I peeled potatoes and carrots, just 
to have my  food. And at ni
ght I didn™t have wh ere to sleep, so my  brother had the 

room with his wife, and with tw o other fe
llows. So we slept five in one room. My 

brother had one bed with his wife, and the 
tw o boys have Œ had one bed. And then  
whoever came from our group, we were in 
the alley, sleeping in the room. And we 
were working in the kitchen. This is the 
way we lived there un
til a month and a half, 
then they got a job for us, 
legally, they legalized that 
[indecipherable]
 are there. 
And then they start registration fo
r people underage to go to the 
United Sta tes
. 
Q: When  you met with other survivors, 
whether they were with Œ meeting your 
brother, or meeting people from your homet
own, or meeting people from different 
places, in the 
DP
 camps and along the way, did Œ wh
at kinds of things did you all 
talk about?

A: Everybody ask, where were you? W

know where they was left? That was the 
only questions that were able to ask. 
Q: Did you have to register
 or sign up or do anything in order to come to the 
United 
States
? If that was your plan, wh
at did you have to do? 
A: Well, first we didn™t have no plans at a
ll. By then th ey had a notice that anybody 
under 18 to register, because there are gon
na be a children group, th e first group to  
go to  the 
United Sta tes

r to be able to be in it. So I 
went and I registered.

A: Seventeen. And we went down
stairs to register and afte
r we register we have to 
go for medical checkups to Œ 
to get the visa. So
 when  I walked 
into the doctor™s 
office, I saw somebody that 
I recognized from Œ it was our 
Œ we lived in a town, but 

he lived in the city. And he  played as Œ he was the doc
tor that it was supposed to 

examine. I know his brother was a dentist,
 but he was never a doctor, he was in a 
mental institu Œ they were saying that 
he was a little crazy fro
m overworking in a 
yeshiva. When I saw 
him I said to him, 
Crazy
 
Blatt

He says, please don™t tell anybody anything
. I will sign you all the papers, you will 
be ready to  go in  the first group, but don™

you want to take an x-ray, fine. You can
 check me up if you ha
ve to , but you don™t 
need to. So he sign me all the papers, he 
took a chest x-ray, and I was the first one 
[indecipherable]

Feldafing
. That was in 1946. 
Q: So 
Blaut
(ph) was his last name  Œ 
A: 
Blatt
(ph). 
Q: 
Blatt
(ph) Œ 
A: Yes. 
Q: Œ was his last  name.  In the 
DP
 camp, in this one and in any other camps also, but 
after the war, did you notice a different mo ral standard among th e survivors after Œ 
A: Yes. There was a lot of people who they
 were sick, there was a lot of people who 
were disbelievers. There were all differe
nt kind of a groups. They  didn™t believe 
that this thing could happen, and no matte
r what who you were talking, they  said, 
pinch me to see if I™m alive. I just don™
t believe that this c
ould happen in this 
generation, in this type of a world. So 
many people were bewildered over it. A lot 
of people got married there, but non-Jews. Th
ere was a lot of intermarriages in the Œ 
in the towns there. A lot of people didn™
t believe in anything. It was like a wild 
dreams for a lot of people, th
ey couldn™t believe it. And 
then when  the groups start 
work ing, and organizations came in, 
they came in fro

Bad Gastein

to see it ag ain, because it is Œ 
Austria

try. Got beautiful 
waterfalls, and the movies, everything they  
give special tickets, they used to have 
shows, and an
ybody from the 
DP 
camp used to go in with
 half price. The people 
were Œ the Austrian people that 
Œ in that area, in that par
ticular town, were very nice 
to the 
DP
 campers. But I was there only a short tim
e, and after I got the papers to go 
to 
Feldafing
, which the doctor signed them to 
me over right away, we went to 
Feldafin g
, there was a strike, a boat strike. 
T h at time the boats weren™t coming 
through to th e 
United States
. And we were supposed  to
 leave in Novemb er, but 
instead of that, in the beginning of Nove
mber, we left in the end of November, 
because there was a strike. And in 
Bremerhaven
, the children used 
to come in that

d, because it got overcrowd ed. And ev en 
then we went already to the boat, we we
re supposed to  take the boat in the 19
th

another boat. So we started that with 
Marine Fletcher
, the boat, and then we went to the 
Marine
 
Marlin

almo st a month to get here
 by boat, because we waited 
[indecipherable]
 for another 
boat, and only got into 
New York 
December the 20
th
, 1946.  
Q: While you were still in 
Europe
, before you came to the 
United States
, at that 
time was there any movement among the 
DP
 campers to  support the establishment 
of a Œ of a Jewish state? 
A: There was a big support about it, and ther
e was a lot of people who registered to 
go. They  were taking them by boat, a lot of
 people went from there to e Œ to that 
time to 
Palestine
, and a lot of people got caught 
Œ I have a lot of family caught on 
Cyprus
. After I came to the 
State
 I find Œ I Œ I used to send th em packages. They 
were a lo Œ a long time on 
Cyprus
. But in the 
DP 
camp s, every place they had big 
signs. When  I was putting up a sign to
o, and I got a reply that from the 
Weinstein

er. The brother died , but the sister 
is alive, an d my Œ and his 
brother™s children are here a

A: My father was here in the early 19
00, before he was married. And after he 
became a citizen, he went back home to
 get married, and the war broke out, and 
being that he was born there, they didn™t 
recognize his citizenship, and he went into 
the army . And after he get back, his visa 
had expired, and they didn™t let him out 
any more.  
Q: The war you™re referring to? 

A: The first war. 
Q: World War I? 
A: World War I. 

Q: When  you were growing up, did 
your father tell you stories about 
America
? 
A: Yeah, my father used to Œ there was 
another person in our to wn . We weren™t in 
the city, we were in a small town three 
miles from the city. And th ere was another 
person who was non-Jewish, who was in 
America
 with the same time with my 
father. And they used to talk
. They used to come over Œ my
 father learned a trade in 
American, he become a blacksmith, and he 
used to made the carriages, like here in 
the 
Fifth Avenue
, the carriages. He had a lot of pe
ople working with him, and he 
used to talk with the other person who 
was from our town Œ in
 English occasionally, 
but we didn™t understand th em
. And th ey used to take meat and make steaks. So 
they were saying them crazy American 
people are eating raw meat. Because they

couldn™t believe that you ju st put the stea
k on top of the coal and you keep it a 
couple of minutes on one side, and a couple 
minutes on the other side, that they are 
eating. But he used to  eat it with the othe
r fellow, and we all looked around, but we 
never ate it.  
Q: A few mo ments ago you to ld 
me that you were coming to th e 
United States
. 
What were your expectations of 
America
, and wh at were those expectations based 
on? 
A: Well, the only expectation I had is I 
knew my Œ my mother™s family was here. 
My mother used to 
co rrespond with cousins who were here in 
New York
. And my 
mother wanted to come
 back and my father, they all 
had couple of times papers to 
come. But the government kept on changing,
 and that time there wasn™t flying, the 
mail came by boat and it took months. And by
 the time one letter came and one visa 
came, the govern ment kept on ch anging and th
ey never were able to come out. And 
my father used to speak about 
America
, how nice it is and how well organized it is 
and how comfortable people live around here
, more comfortable than on the towns 
in 
Euro pe
. So the expectation was that I 
will find somebody from the family, 
because in 
Euro pe
 we lost a lot, maybe we™ll find somebody.  
Q: When you came to this country, 
what were your first impressions?

A: For th e first night we stopped in front of
 the Statue of Liberty, and all night we 
didn™t sleep. We were just lo
oking at the Statue of Liberty. We saw the city lit up, 
and they  were waiting to embark. We were
 there a couple hours. And then in  the 
morning, we went off the boat, and they
 took us to a children place, a home. You 
wouldn™t believe it, th ere were cribs wa
iting for us, because they said a children 
group was coming. It was in the 
Bronx
, I think it was 
Ca-C aldell
(ph) Avenue, but I 
don™t rememb er the number. And it was a big h
ouse, and in  there we went Œ mo st of 
the group went there. And every day fam
ilies from the group came
 over to see. And 
there were a lot of people who came to a
dopt children. I got there, it was Decemb er 
the 20
th
 I arrived, and the 21
st
 already, my mother™s cous in came to  see us. And the 
first day they asked permis
sion to take me out for a day. So I felt a little 
comfortable, because they were speaking Jewish and Hungarian, because I didn™t 
speak no English. And I wa
s there for the first couple of days, about two days til 
Christmastime. And then I went back, and th
en they were asking me if I want to go 
live with them. So I said ok
ay for the beginning, until my
 rest of the family will 
come. And I was living with
 them til I got married.  
Q: Can you tell me who was 
with you on th at children™s 
group transport that came? 
A: There were all ba Œ all ch ildren from all over, from all the 
DP 
camps. There was 
a group organizer, the childre
n group organization. All I 
know is there was three 
Cs

they had in the hat. What th
at meaned, I don™t know. Three 
Cs
 he had on the hat, 
and we all had rooms in the Œ in the sh
ip, it was like a military boat, but it was 
considered first class. And we ate, but 
ich Œ fo od was plenty, but nobody was able 
to eat. It was shaking so mu
ch the boat that food didn™t 
stay in anybody™s stomach. 
Who Œ ev erybody was di
zzy from the boat.  
Q: How old were the children? 
A: They were from 17 and 18;
 16, 17, 18. One boy was 
13, who met a soldier in 
Austria
 and adopted  him, a 13 year old boy in the group. He was the youngest. 
Q: When  you came here, what did you plan 
to do? Wh at wa Œ were gonna be your 
first steps in building a life here? 
A: When I arrived, I had no plans. First 
I was waiting to see how my sisters an d the 
rest of the family will come
 out. But they didn™t get no vi
sas, all of them, to come 
here. So one sister came to 
Canada
 with her husband. And my  brother and my 
other sister with their husbands wen Œ and 
my  brother with his wife, they went to 
South America
, because we had family there, 
and the quota th-there was more 
liberal. So they went to 
South America
, to 
Uruguay
. They settled in 
Uruguay
. 
And I was here alone for the first couple of
 years, but I was living with a cousin of 
my mother™s. 

Q: When  you came, did you feel th
at the Americans welcomed you?

Q: Œ tinuation of the 
United States Holocaust Memorial Museum
 interview with 
Bella Pasternak
. This is tape one, side 
B
, and I was in the process of asking you if 
Americans were curious abou
t your Holocaust experience
, and you told me that 
they asked you Œ wh at kinds of things 
did you tell them, and 
how did they react? 
A: Well, they couldn™t believe it. It™s lik
e when somebody will wa
lk into your house 
and say, you have five minut
es; pack, and you have to co
me with us. And they said, 
really? That™s the way it happened? They  
just said, how in the world could that 
happen? I said well, this is
 the way exactly it happened
. Even if you knew, they 
wouldn™t have believe you. It just happ ened that I knew it before, that was gonna 
happen. But then I went home, and I was 
telling my  mo th er and 
father what I was 
told. They all said, it
™s very, very hard to believe. 
Everything they  else Œ they 
understand that I™m telling them
 the truth, but to come to the house and tell us that 
you have to leave and th
ey taking you away , the r
eaction was, it™s kind of 
impossible.  

Q: Now, are you referring to 
your Œ your experiences before the war, e-early in the 
war. Let me just see if I can get you to cl
arify that. Ho w did you know, before your 
parents did, what was going to  happen? 

 
Interview with Bella
 Simon Pasternak

27
A: The reason I knew was because everything in 
Europe
 was rationed, and 
everything was blackmail. If you 
[indecipherable]
 anything, they used to put you 
in jail. You couldn™t do business. But be
ing th at I was young, and my  mo ther and 
my father, they were very mu
ch afraid to do any kind of
 a business. I was very not 
afraid. I didn™t think anything could happe
n, so I used to sell merchandise. My 
father was a blacksmith, and if you wanted
 anything, clothing or shoes, you had to 
give them food, otherw ise you wouldn™t 
get them, because all you had rationed, a 
pair of shoes a year, or a pair of soles in
 the shoes. So  the Œ the Œ in order to buy 
shoes, or to buy any kind of a food th
at you wanted, you ha
d to exchange for 
something else. So, I used 
to go into the city, whic
h was three miles. We had 
everything in the house. We had co ws, 
we had chickens, and from the town  you 
were able to buy everything. Now, in orde
r to go to the city and sell it on the black 
market, in case they catch me
 or something, I had to ha
ve connection. So I know th e 
head of the police, th
e captain, and I used to give hi
m things for nothing, because I 
couldn™t charge him the black market price. 
And th e price that it would have been  to 
charge, I may as well give him a present, because it was pennies. So I became very 

friendly with him. And he was the one th
at told  me, a couple of days before it 
happened . And wh en I went home, and I men
tioned it, nobody wanted
 to believe it.

Q: What other things did you tell people
 here about the war, besides the Œ the 
rounding up of the people? 
A: You see, my father was a blacksmith, a
nd the ji Œ the Germans were in our town. 
The sold iers. And we had the pa
 Œ a big house, compared to
 the rest of the people in 
town . So , being that our house was the bigg
est, they came and 
they took my mother 
and father out of their bedr
oom, and th ere were officers of the German Reich, who 
were sleeping by us in the ho
use. And their horses were 
Œ my  father was taking care 
of the horses in the Œ as blacksmith to 
put th em Œ shoe the horses. And th ey liked  
the food and the milk, so they
 ate by us. They used to pa
y us, and they used to  tell 
my mother, if she™ll be kind
 enough to make them food
 for breakfast, some for 
lunch and supper. My mo ther had no choice,
 she cooked them, a
nd she served them. 
And even when th
ey came for us, my father was 
still with their horses. And they 
had to wait til he finishes the horses in orde
r to leave. At that point already they 
believe me, what I told them the da
ys before, but it was kind of late. 
Q: Did you tell Ameri
cans about your experiences in camps? 

A: Yeah. We talked abou
t it. We talked and we a Œ when I arrived in 
Auschwit z
 the 
first day, on the ghetto, we were outdooron the ghettos. And 
there was raining, it 
was right after Passover, between Passover and 
[indecipherable]
 we were in the 
ghetto. Just before

. And it was rainy weather. And th ere was no

bunks, was nothing, it was out in th e wo ods. 
And we took the blan
kets that we took 
with ourself, and everybody made their 
own little sukkah. And th at™s where we 
slept, the kids all crying. There was no bathroom facilities, there was no wat Œ 
running water. There was a little lake nearby,
 people went for water to wash, or 
food, whatever they Œ 
they were giving out ration fo od
. And we were in the ghetto 
about three weeks. And at that
 time that we were in the ghetto, this particular person 
that I knew used to take me out as Œ take 
Œ he used to come fo
r the Jewish girls for 
maids, to take them out in 
the city. So every day a truck 
used to come for the Jewish 
girls to go to be a maid for the Hungarians.
 So  this particular guy requested me to 
go as his maid. But I used to go in ther
e and I used to do nothing, just talk to 
[indecipherable]
 and at night he used to come and 
he used to drop a bread to Œ in 
our place and used to say, ju
st close the lights already, it™s getting late. And he had 
suggested even then, that if we want to 
leave, he would give us a truck for 40 
people to leave. Th
en  my  mo ther said, 40 people, 
who I™m gonna take for that™s 
gonna be with the rest, 
will be with us too. So we didn™t go nowhere. 
Q: I™d like to maybe clarify my  question. 
I wanted to know wh at Œ wh at you told  
people about 
Auschwitz
, for example. And how did they
 deal with what you were 
telling them?

A: Well, a lot of people had some ideas, 
because there were the American soldiers 
already, that they used to write home a
nd explain them what™s was going on. That 
time with Œ it was a little knowledge aboutit, not too much. A lot of people didn™t 
even want to Œ they  Œ they 
says it™s hard to believe, but 
they know it had happen ed.  
Q: When you first came to this country, di d you already at that time have a real 
good idea of just how many Jews had died? 

A: No. We had an idea that
 a lot of them did not come
 home. But how many exactly 
died, nobody knew. 

Q: When  did you begin to realize the magnitude of the genocid e? 

A: The Œ a man that haman Œ the Œ the Œ th
e six million or whatever they Œ they had 
perished, we knew it only by year after, year
 and a half it took to  calculate. Because 
at that point when I Œ it was st-still a 
lot of people still were coming. But nobody 
knew exactly how many.  

Q: Now that you™re in this country, 
were you able to go back to school? 
A: Yeah, when I went Œ when I came to my
 mo ther™s cousin , she had two girls. One 
was two years younger than me, and th e ot
her one was only about four years old. 
And I went at night school that time, and 
I went to Œ first a couple of months they 
didn™t let me do nothing. 

Q: Why? 

 
Interview with Bella

October 22, 1997 
 

 
 
31
A: I don™t know. They just 
said I need a rest. And they
 asked me how I survived, 
and I said that when I arrived in 
Auschwitz
, there was a Polish fellow who asked 
me how old I was. I already had 
[indeciphera ble]
 me a n d  my  mo th
er, to go with 
her. And he asked me how old are you? I sa
id 16. He says, well, say you are 17 Œ 
say you are 18. He pushed me in a side, 
he said, you are not 16, you are 18. So  
when I went to registered, they regist me Œ the Œ I was registered as 1 8 . And my 
birthday is 
[indecipherable]
 in that particular thing. She™s got here the information 
about it. And th -this is why I survived, because I didn™t say I was 16.  

Q: What kind of paper is this? W
hy don™t you tell me w h at this is? 
A: I Œ I just wrote away this year in 
[indecipherable]
 and th ey sent Œ they send me 
an Œ an acknowledgement that
 I was there, but my age di
fference is two years. Not 
exactly with the 
date, either.  
Q: Do you know why your re
latives wanted you to  just rest for awhile? Did Œ did 
you have any health problems? 
A: I didn™t have a lot of health prob
lems. I had fallen down and my  wrist was 
broken, but I just put my  belt and I tied it 
around, and it didn™t grow back properly. 
So when  the daughter
 become that time 16, she bough
t her a fur coat. So she bought 
me the same coat, and when 
I picked up the coat, I fain
ted. So when I fainted I Œ 
they took me to the doctor 
and the doctor took x-rays 
and they said my wrist was

broken, but it didn™t heal properly, and they  
had to re-break it again, and put it in a 
cast. So for awhile I was just home with a cas
t, and after a Œ they told me after what 
I went through, they want me to take it 
easy, and then I will go to school, or to 
work, whatever I want. So they
 didn™t want me to travel to
 the city, so they find me 
a job there in that vicinity, but I was able 
to walk to it. And at night I would Œ used 
to go to school to learn English. 
Q: Tell me about that job. 
A: I was working in a dress factory. So I 
started out as a floor girl, just carrying 
strings, and then I got promoted. I Œ they
 sh -showed me how to make dresses. I 
learned a trade and I become forelady in th
e company. So I started from scratch , 
and couple of years later, I was w o rking th
ere and they liked me
. So I worked there 
for a long time. Until I got married
 I was in the same company. 
Q: Did you have any social life? 
A: Wherever they went, they used to take
 me, and I used to go
 out a lot with the 
daughter. And went from school, 
they had places, and family
 affairs, whatever they 
had, family affairs. I used to be part of the family there.

A: Very little. It wasn™t too much. I 
didn™t understand it 
too much because 
everything was in English. So I used to 
ask a lot of questions in Hungarian what 
they were saying, because I didn™t Œ I didn™t understand it. Later on I followed it, 
when  they  reviewed it on th e television, 
later on. I was by the television, and I 
watched it. But in th e beginning I didn™t understand it. 
Q: Did you follow the news on the part
 Œ partition of the state of pa Œ of 
Palestine
 
into two different states, an Arab state and a Jewish state? 
A: Yeah, that we followed, because I Œ I us
ed to get the Hungar
ian paper, they  used 
to bring me the paper so I should un
derstand it. Because that I understood. 
Q: Tell me what it was like for you, given 
your experiences, to hear that there 
would be a Jewish state. 

A: It was very thrilling, I co Œ I just c
ouldn™t believe it. I wa
s crying for happiness 
when  that happened. 

Q: And when 
Israel
 declared statehood? 
A: I was go Œ I was trying to th at time Œ th
ere was a lot of people that I knew, they 
went to 
Israel 
and I used to send them 
p ack ag es. T h ey
 were in 
Cyprus
, and a lot of 
them was in 
Germany
, and 
Italy
 and wh erev er I Œ mo ney I used to make, I used to 
come home and I used to make pack
age and send it away. I used to get 
correspondence from all ove
r, from Œ they were in 
Italy
, they were in 
Germany
,

they were in 
France
 and 
Cyprus
, and they  kept in touch with me. I al Œ always 
knew where they are, and I keep in touc
h ev en now when  I 
go to see them.  
Q: Did you have an opport
unity  to make any friends 
on your own, aside from 
people that you met through your relatives? 
A: Oh yes. There were a couple of people
 from Œ also survivors that settled not too 
far from where I lived, and they had girls mi
ne age, and we used to go out together, 
and we had the Œ also a group of American
s that they were sp
eaking Yiddish, and 
we used to get together. And after I went to
 school, I used to speak a little bit. And I 
got along with them fine. 

Q: Did you start dating? 
A: About two years after. I us
ed to out in a group a lot, but not really dating. Two 
years later I used to go out with Œ 
in  a group, but not really dating. 
Q: When  you started to mingle, were 
there any special gentlemen that were 
interesting to you? 

A: Mostly Œ at that time mo
stly we used to go to the 
HIAS
, or to organizations that 
I used to be the newcomers, and I always 
wanted to find out wh
o else is coming up, 
because the Œ there used to 
come boats Œ mostly then they used to come by the 
HIAS
, we used to go to find 
out who came from our area, and wh at news they are 
bringing. So  you find a lot of 
people that we knew from the 
DP
 camps and from the

unt Œ our own to wn . And th en we starting Œ th
ey used to have the sp ecial affairs for 
the refugees camps. T h ey used
 to have groups in the 
HIAS
, they used to have it in 
the Joint, they used to ha
ve it in the Œ with  our diplomat, and they  used to get 
together from all over. And we met all the 
people who used to say in the boat, we 
will meet y ou whenever they 
gonna have a Hanukkah part
y, or a Purim party, we 
used to go togeth er, just to see 
our friends from the other side.  
Q: What I™m trying to get at is, I wa
nt to know how you met your husband. 
A: Well, we went to a Purim party, I a
ssume. It was a P u rim or Hanukkah party, 
and I went with my  cousin™s daughter, and with other people from our town , a 
group, because we lived out of the city. And we went 
there and somebody looked at 
me, I didn™t recognize him. And one day I 
got a telephone call from him, and he 
said his name was 
Andrew
, because he Œ 
Andrew
. He said it™s a Romanian name, 
so he start talking Romanian. He said he
 saw me, and he would like to meet me. 

And this is the way we had a blind date. 
So he came out with his brother and his 
sister-in-law, together with the car, and we 
had a blind date, the four of us together. 
And we met in early ™51 or ™52, I don™t re
m Œ I think it was in ™52 that we met the 
first time. 
Q: And so you met, a
nd then wh at happened ? 

 
Interview with Bella
 Simon Pasternak  
October 22, 1997 
 

 
 
36
A: We went out for a while, and then I we
nt out with other people for a while. I 
couldn™t make up my  mind. And then, even
tually, I think the Korean War broke out, 
and my  friend called me, and he told me th
at he was drafted. So I Œ it was just 
before New Year™s, I send him a New Year ca
rd, and I wished him 
good luck in his 
career. So then he called me, and we got toge
ther again, and after then we started to 
go out mo re steady, and we got 
engaged, and married in ™53. 
Q: So your husband is also a survivor? 
A: Yes, my  husband is
 a survivor, also from 
Romania
, but from a different area. 
That™s like a different state.  
Q: When  you and your new hu
sband were first married, wh
at plan s did you have for 
your futu re together?  

A: We didn™t make big plans. He was 
working and I was working and that time it 
was Œ it wasn™t as easy  as today, there we
re no apartments, it 
was difficult to find 
apartments. In order to get 
an apartment, you actually 
had to buy th e apartment, 
throw out the old fu rniture, and get apartm
ents. So we moved to
 the city, where he 
was closer to wo rk. And I gave up my  
job, and I went, in order to make it 
convenience for him. But th
en, as I walked around on 
the area, there was a job 
opening there, and I walked in and I got
 a job. And I was working first as a 

operator, as a dressmaker. And th en he Œ 
they approached me, the new owner, and

he said look, our forelady is getting married
 and I would like you to  take her job. 
And I said Œ I looked  on him, I said, you 
mu st be kidding. You know I™m expecting 
a baby, I™m only wo rking temporarily. I said , you better look fo
r another forelady. 
He says, well, you know so
mething? Take the job un
til we find somebody else. I 
said, but look, sometimes I don™t feel good 
and I don™t come in and I can™t really 
work so much. I™d rather wo
rk piecework. This way I do
n™t cheat you, and I know 
that I™m only getting what™s coming to me. 
He says, don™t worry ab out that. So he 
took me, and I became the forelady in that place, and he 
was so nice to me. When I 
had to go to the doctor, he
 used to come to the doct
or with me, I shouldn™t waste 
time with the bus, going back and forth. He
 used to wait for me
. T h e doctor even 
thought that he was my husb
and. He used to take me 
to the doctor fo r monthly 
check-ups, practically, til Œ 
I was working for him as 
a forelady til two hours Œ I 
came home at night and I took home a samp le
 to make for the next day to take to 
work, to be able to show 
the girls how to do it. And I call them up the next day, I 
said Œ from the hospital, I said
, pick up the sample, I™m in the hospital, I have a boy. 
He was first one to send me the flowers,
 before my husband send them to me. He 
was very nice to me, and he wanted me to 
go back to work. By 
then my first so n, 
was 
Jerry
, was a colic baby, and I couldn™t put
 him down. He offered me a nurse 
plus my salary to go back to
 work, but I just couldn™t do it. I used to go with the kid

a little to look around and he
lp him a little, til he found
 somebody. He was very 
nice. They  were Italian people, very nice pe
ople. Bu t he got the store, the factory, 
he got, and he went in  with a partner. 
And he put in th e money, an d the partner 
didn™t like it, and he walked out of him.
 And he really had no experience in 
dressmaking, so he was stuck. So I tried to
 help them out. So we helped each other. 
And that™s when  I stopped work
ing in the dress line, when 
Jerry 
was born, two 
hours af Œ before he was born, practically
. I wa Œ he took me to the doctor and 
docto r says, see you in a week. Then I went 
home and I had to go
 into the hospital. 
Q: How many ch ildren do you have? 
A: Three. Three boys.  
Q: How did you pick  their names? 
A: Well, my first one, I was living ba Œ 
by my uncle, and his daughter was married 
before me, she got married Œ she was marri
ed three years and she had no children, 
so my  uncle Œ my  Œ actually my  cousin ™s husband said gee, I™ll never have my  
father™s name. So being he Œ they were so  nice for Œ to me, and my father and my 
mo ther already had a name by my  other sist
ers and brothers, so I fig u red it was just 
right to give his name. After that his da
ughter had three childre
n, but it took her Œ 
my first name, 
[indecipherable]
 that she should have th
e children. So that™s the 
way I pick ed the first time. And then 
my  second name Œ my  second child was 

 
Interview with Bella

39
named after my  husband™s grandfather, and 
my  other one that was born, the third 
son has the name of my father and my  brother. 
Q: What have you to ld your
 sons about your childhood, your life before the war? 
A: We spoke to them when 
they were already about seve
n years old, they kept on 
asking. When they went to school, they 
said, everybody has birthday parties, and 
everybody has grandparents, how come th
ey don™t have any? That™s when  we 
started to tell them what ha
ppened to their grandparents. And they  kept on asking. I 
never refused an answer. I didn™t want to 
bring it up when they were too young, but 
after then they start asking, and wh
en ev er th ey  ask e
d, I told them. 
Q: What did you tell them about your parents? 
A: I was telling them that we were very
, very  religious. I had a brother who was a 
rabbi, who was so religious, he came home 
from the yeshiva at 19 and a half, not 
even 20, and he told  my  fa
ther, th-they should both rest
 in peace, he says, I™m 
getting married. So my father 
jumped in this chair, he 
said, you™re getting married? 
You™re in yeshiva, there is no girls ther
e, how are you getting married? He says, my 
Rebbe find me a wife. I said, and who™s th
e wife? He sa ys, my Rebbe™s sister ™ s 
daughter. I said Œ my father said, did you s
ee her? Nope, but if my Rabbi said that 
she™s the right girl for me, I 
am su re she™s the right girl. So my father said, what if 
she™s blind? Or she has hand on her feet
, you didn™t see her, you don™t know. He

says, it™ll be a bigger mitzvah.
 They went to an engageme
nt party, I remember I was 
young th at time, but I rememb er hearing th
em talk. My mother and father went and 
they got engaged, and they came back an
d they were telling 
us, and they were 
sitting by the table, because the reason that 
the rabbi wanted them to get married is 
because her husband died. Th-The girl™s mo
ther™s husband died, the girl™s father 
had died, and sh e Œ there™s a fami ly of four
 children an d the oldest is 18, and there 
is no 
shochet
, and there was no rabbi in to wn. And he figured  that he would be 
good for that. At that age he became the 
youngest rabbi in the area there. And they 
got married. 
Q: As your sons got olde
r, did you tell them about 
your wartime ex periences? 
A: Yeah, we always talk about the wartim
es experiences, what we went through. 
And I always wanted  to be a lawyer when I 
was small. I told them that I Œ I want Œ 

my father, being that he was in 
America
, he did not speak Ro
manian, and he was 
born wh en it was 
Hungary
. And when he came back, he 
didn™t go to school back to 
learn Romanian, and wh enev er he had to 
go someplace, I used to go with him to 
read what 
[indeciphera ble]
 and tell him if he could sign
 that or no. Cause he could 
speak, but he didn™t read and he didn™t write
 in Romanian. He on
ly was able to do it 
in English, which I didn™t know that 
he knew it, and Jewish, Yiddish, or in 
Hungarian. But Ro manian he didn™t know. 
So when  I was seven Œ after I was seven 

 
Interview with Bella
 Simon Pasternak  
October 22, 1997 
 

 
 
41
years old, and I was his translator, he us
ed to say, I™m only gonna sign what my 
lawyer will say I can sign. And therefore, I 
always said I Œ when I grow up, I™ll be a 
lawyer. But I never finished it.  
Q: Did you ever tell your sons about what 
you had to go through in th e ghetto and 
the camps? 
A: Yes, we spoke about it. 

Q: What kinds of things do they
 ask you about th
ose experiences? 
A: They ask that Œ how many we were in 
the family, an d how many came back, and 

how was it in the lagers, and how did I got 
here, how did I met his father. We went 
over that many, many times.  
Q: Did you ever get a sense that perhaps y
our children had questions that they either 
wouldn™t or couldn™t bring themselves to ask you? 
A: Well, if they have a lot of Œ cause ma
ybe they had asked Œ because mo st of our 
family are Holocaust 
survivors. And when ever they di
dn™t speak to us, they must 
have spoken to them, because
 they didn™t want to bring 
it up to us, we shouldn™t 
cry. Or they  shouldn™t hurt us, or they didn
™t know how to put it.
 But whenever they 
got together with their cousins, they always
 used to talk or ask somebody else. It™s 
easier sometimes to ask a 
stranger, than your own. 
Q: Was there ever something that you wanted them to ask 
that they didn™t? 

 
Interview with Bella
 Simon Pasternak  
October 22, 1997 
 

 
 
42
A: Not really. 
Q: Was there ever something that you wa
nted for them to know, but you weren™t 
able to tell them, and they never asked? 
A: They all, when they went away to sc
hool, or wh en they  went to high school, 
there was a lot of groups that they were in
volved with th
e Holocaust, and they were 
involved with the group
s, so whatever answers they ne
eded, most of 
the time, they 
got it from them. And whatever
 I felt that they didn™t as
k me, they didn™t want to 
know, or they already knew it. Because 
all of them are in
volved  on the new 
generation Holo caust group. 
Q: What kind of education did 
you provide for your ch ildren? 
A: Well, when we got married, we weren™t 
religious at all. My husband was way the 
other side, he didn™t even k
eep kosher. I went out Œ if 
I ate fish or anything but 
treyf 
to go out to eat 
[indecipherable]
 the first meal mine was pi
g. I didn™t eat it when I 
was in this country. But he didn™t keep
 kosher at all. Sha
bbas we didn™t observe, 
none of us. We lived by my  cousin, w
ho was a kosher butcher. Bu t Shabbas they 
didn™t work, but they went shopping, we 
went to the movies. 
No work  around the 
house or anything. They  used to  play ca
rds in Shabbas, but it wasn™t Orthodox. 
They were more Conservative 
than Orthodox. And it was sort of a Œ for me too, I 
mean, Saturday used 
to go to the city, 
meet my  friends. Sunday Œ during th e week 

 
Interview with Bella

43
we work ed and went to school. Satu rday  
and Sunday we used 
to go to  the city 
shopping or meet our friends. And when 
I me t my  husband, we weren™t thinking 
about 
[indecipherable]
. But then in 
1948, when the 
Arnold Consta ble
 estate got 
sold in 
Westchester 
for a
 
yeshiva, that time there wa
s a big article in that ﬁ
New 
York Times
.ﬂ 
Arnold Constable
 estate sold for yeshiva. 
It was an estate of 27 or 
28 acres, beautiful, by the water. It™s a ca
stle, a beautiful place. Everybody from the 
city came to see it. So I Œ we took a ride 
with friends and neighbors, we took a ride 
to see the s Œ the new school. At that point
 I wasn™t even married, didn™t even think 
about it, so I said to myself, it is just 
gorgeous. If I™ll ever have children, I would 
like to send them there. And this is the 
way it started out that I send them to the 
yeshiva. I didn™t have no other dreams of ma
king them religious, or anything else. 
Despite that, I came from a very, very Or
thodox family. And th
en  w h en  th ey  w e re 
born, I send them to school. And 
Jerry
 went to school when  the Œ got ready to go to 
school Œ wh en 
Jerry
 went to school, the first w
eek he came home, he says, 
Mommy, you know what I learned? I said
, if you™ll tell me, I™ll know. He said, 
you™re not supposed  to wo rk on Shabbat, 
not you and not Daddy. Saturday  is a day 
of rest. I said to him, 
Jerry
, they are right and you are right. Bu t you have a choice; 
if you go to a public school, I could stay 
home and you don™t have Œ I don™t have to 
work . Bu t if you want to go to that school
, I have to wo rk in order to pay fo r you 

 
Interview with Bella

they should take you into school. So I sa id to him, got time to decide, it™s Friday. 
Monday you let me know, do you 
want to go to school, or
 do you want to go to 
public school? So Sunday ni
ght I bathe him and I prepared
 the clothes and I sai d , so 
what is the situation for tomorrow? He 
said, well, I decided that while I go to 

school, you work . But once I st
op, then you sh
ould become 
shomer Shabbos
. So I 
said, you got a deal. So I kept my promise.
 But we were work ing, Saturday was the 
busiest day for both of us
. My husband came from work
 and I took the car and I 
went to work. And even  wh
en they went to s Œ to 
Yeshiva
 Un iversity High School, 
where I took 
Steven
 and I put him on 
[indecipherable]
, I went to the rabbi there for 
an interview, and the rabbi said, and I™m sure you are 
shomer
 
Shabbo s
. My 
husband wouldn™t say a word. I said, sorry. 
I said, the prices you ch arge, I have to 
work  in order to pay it. I don™t have nob
ody to pay it for me. Th
ey didn™t reduce the 
price, so I had to wo rk in order to pay 
it. And they continued 
yeshiva, but they Œ 
Jerry
 was even Œ wh en he finished  high school and 
Yeshiva
 University, he applied 
to 
NYU
 and they called him for an interview. 
And being that they called him for an 
interview in Sh abbat, he refused to go to
 that school because they called him for a 
interview in Shabbat. I said, 
Jerry
, they don™t have to know
 that you are Orthodox. 
He said, but can they see I™m in 
Yeshiva
 Univ ersity? Would I be in 
Yeshiva
 
University if I wouldn™t be
 Orthodox? So
 I told him,
 Jerry
, there are many people 

 
Interview with Bella

45
in 
Yeshiva
 Univ ersity and they ™re not Orth odox,
 they travel in Shabbat. All you 
have to do is write them a note or call th
em up and say you want
 another interview. 
But he didn™t want to go any mo re
. And for that reason he went to 
Yeshiv a
 College. 
And the other ones never asked 
me, and they  continued it.  
Q: What do you mean they continued it? 
A: 
Yeshiva
 College. 
Q: Did th ey get edu
cation beyond college? 
A: Yes, they all went to law schools. An
d that time it w as very difficult to get into 

law school because they ask where did 
your parents graduate
d from. And despite 
that they were very good students, not beca
use they were my child ren, they couldn™t 
get into 
Columbia
 or to  a school in the vicinity. So 
Jerry 
went to 
California
, 
Alvin
 went to 
Sain t Louis
, and 
Steven 
went to 
Boston
. Because we didn™t go to 
school here, so 
Yeshiva 
University, when they gradua
te over a hundred students in 
a class, and they only took
 two or three students from ea Œ to each school in law 
school, so I was in the botto m of the list, 
because we didn™t go to no schools in here, 
in the state or colleges. So 
that™s where they  ended up, in very  good schools. They  
got a fairly good education, I hope.

Q: You mentioned that you had to make 
comp romises, work ing on Sh abbat and you 
know, th-the deal that you made with 
Jerry
. Were there other compromises that 
you had to make raising a family
 and working in this country? 
A: Well, we didn™t ba Œ travel. We didn™t 
have a big house or 
anything, we had a 
small apartment. It was expensive and 
the co lleges were very high and th e 
schooling was very expensive, although th
ey  didn™t Œ didn™t Œ when  I start working 
already, later on, I was able to Œ to get an
 Œ a Œ a house before 
they went to high 
school, but when they were small, we were 
sacrificing to that extent that I put them 
all three in one bedroom. We had a one
 bedroom apartment and that™s where I 
raised them. We slept in a open couch in 
the living room. But we sacrificed in order 
to give th em a good education.  
Q: I wanted to ask you 
if you had followed the 
Eichmann
 trial? 
A: Yes, I followed the 
Eichmann
 trial a lot. 
[indeciphera ble]
 watched already on 
television, that was televised.  
Q: What were your thoughts and your re
actions to th at trial and the judgment? 
A: My th ought was why it took them so 
long to find th em? With all the knowledge 
and with all the new things 
that they  have and they 
[indecipherable]
 spaces and 
everything, they had to take them so 
many years til they find somebody? They  
knew all along wh ere it was. 
America
 had the records from a
ll the Nazis that they

were here in 
America
, and the Nazis are 
there on Œ in Œ in 
Ca na da
 and all over the 
world. It really didn™t had to take them that long to find
 them. That was my 
reaction.  
Q: Did you have a reaction to the fact that 
Eichmann
 was being tried in 
Jeru salem
, 
in 
Israel
? 
A: No, I didn™t think th at he should be trie
d any other place, because the majority of 
the people in 
Israel
 are survivors, and they were th
e one that knew him the best, so 
they know mo stly what he did. He would Œ 
even there, it took 
a long time to have a

Beginning Tape Two, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of the 
United
 
States Holoca ust Memorial Museum
 
interview with 
Bella Pasternak
. This is tape two, side
 A
. In the 1950s and 60s and 
70s, this country  went through some majo
r, major changes. You were busy wo rking 
and raising your children, but I wanted to 
know what your though
ts were about, you 
know, things like the war in 
Vietnam
, an-and the Cold War. 
A: Well, the war in 
Vietnam
 and the Cold War th Œ ever
y war that you look, even 
now you can look on the 
Yugoslavia
 war and all those things, it™s heartbreaking to 
see all the refugees. You know, wh en 
you see the refugees, you rememb er of 
yourself, how you were. It™s 
a very difficult situation, it™
s heartbreaking. The war is 
never right to have. No matter na Œ no 
matter who the enemy 
is. It™s Œ innocent 
people will still suffer. It™s not
 the army that suffers, it™s 
not the soldiers. It™s th e 
innocent people, you see children starving and 
all this thing in the streets. It™s a 
terrible situation no matter where you go a
nd you look on it, regardless what race 
they are, or what ki
nd of a people are.  
Q: There was a lot of activity also in the country in the ar
ea of civil rights. Did you 
follow so me of those changes that were going on in th is country?

 was killed, and all those things, I followe
d them. I liked to look on all this, in 
the history, from all th is, people that th
ey suffered and they tried to better 
themselves. It™s a terrib le thing. I think th
at it should be equa
l right for everybody, 
doesn ™t make a difference. They™re not any be
tter than we are, th
e color or Œ or the 
white. It should be eq ual opportunity to all.
 It doesn ™t ma ke a difference, but it was 
here terrible when they hold
 them back, too. It wasn™t
 right to hold the colored 
people back  and everything. I don™t think it was right. 
Q: What about the assassination of 
Kenned y
? 
A: I cried. I couldn™t believe it when it ha
ppened. I Œ I remember lik e today that I Œ 
that Œ when it happened in 1963
, when they said that he 
got shot. First I thought it 
was a joke. And then, when I saw it on tele
vision, it was heartbreaking. His father 
was a anti-Semite, but the Œ the children Œ he 
suffered a lot. All his children, I think, 
he got punished right and left. 
Q: What about the sexual revolution in  this country? 
A: Well, I think that is a little too much fo
r me. I don™t Œ that I don™t believe in. You 
see, I was 1 7 , and there was a lot of revol
ution, even between the people in the 
concen tration camps after Œ out 
of the concentration, in the 
DP
 camps, a lot of 
people were free, and that Œ I don™t believe 
in that. That is one thing I Œ I Œ I would 
stay away from it. I don™t Œ I hope my gran
dchildren will stay aw
ay from it, I d on™t

believe in it. I believe the old-fashioned 
way. You love a person, you get married, 
you settle them and you live. But that Œ th
is kind of a life, with all this disease 
especially going around, I think is wrong. 
Q: What about the Œ the women™s m
ovement for Œ for wo men™s rights? 
A: That is the right way. I mean, a wo
man shouldn™t be lower than  a man. They 
have the same brain, they have the same  ab
ility to work. Matter of
 fact, in a lot of 
places you find women better than men. It
 should be eq ual opportunity if you 
qualify fo r a job, it shouldn™t be a di
fference you™re a wo man or a man. 
Golda Meir
 
was a great woman, a great president.  
Q: Was there anything else that™s ha Œ th
at happened in  your ti 
Œ in your years of 
being in this country ? Any other issues or 
problems that were of particular interest 
to you? 
A: I don™t think I had a lot of problems
. I had problems my  family was all over, 

until I was able to bring my sister over from 
South America
 in the family, which 
they came in 1962 to this country. 
I still have Œ my  brother is in 
Uruguay
. I have a 
sister that Œ from 
Canada
 that sh Œ I brought her 
over. Instead of coming to 
New 
York
, she went to 
California
, and my  other sister in Œ that was in 
Romania
, now 
she™s in 
Isr ael
. But to get the family together at
 Œ all at o n ce, it™s very difficult. 
Q: Did you ever experience anti-
Semitism in this country? 

 
Interview with Bella
 Simon Pasternak  
October 22, 1997 
 

 
 
51
A: No, I don™t think I would say that I e
xperienced anti-Semitism 
in this country.  
Q: How do you respond 
to Holocaust deniers? 
A: I don™t think anybody w
ith good knowledge would adm
it that. It only the people 
that they are denying that, 
either they were Nazis, 
or they are anti-Semites. 
Otherwise they would not sa
y it because it™s open to the public and th e mu seums 
and Œ and the newspapers a
nd every place else. I don™t think a normal person would 
really say that there was no Holocaust 
Q: In your opinion, do you think th at American
 Jews may ever be in danger in this 
country, either from skinheads or ne
o-Nazis or from any other element? 
A: I tell you, nobody would be
lieve that it could happen 
again, and nobody would 
want to believe that it could happen agai
n, but unfortunately, nobody believed it in 
Euro pe
 either that it could happen. And th e 
situation in here too, they have 
swastikas in synagogues, they have a lot of
 swastikas in Jewish 
homes that th ey put 
on. And there is 
anti
-
Semite
 in here. I personally didn™t Œ didn™t see it in my  
immediate area or my house, but there 
are people who could start something like 
that, if it™s not cont
rolled in that.  
Q: What are your thoughts about the resurgen ce, this new interest in the Holocaust? 
A: It™s good in one say and not too good in
 the other thing, because I think they are 
putting too much effort into it now,
 and a lot of people resent it.

Q: Can you explain what you mean by too mu ch
 effort, and a lot of people resent it? 
A: There™s a lot of people who feel that th
ey shouldn™t go too much
 in the past, they 
sh Œ instead of that, they should look fo r 
the future of the Jewish people, not so 
much on the past.  
Q: I assume that you have been to 
Israel
 man y  times. W h at is it like for you to be in 
Israel
? 

A: I go to 
Israel
 often, I have family there, I ha
ve friends, very, very good friends 
that we suffered together, and we corresp
ond together and we meet as many times 
as we go there, if we can.
 Fortunately we go for thre
e or Œ three weeks or four 
weeks and it™s not enough time 
to see everybody, but Œ 
[break] 
Q: Have you ever re
gretted not moving to  
Israel
? 
A: Well, I really wanted to go to 
Isr a e l
, I wanted to move many times. When the 
children were small, I was hesitant, for th
e simp le reason because th ey™re constantly 
on war there, and I didn™t want the boys to
 throw it up to me and say gee, why did 
you come? I was hoping they would go on
 their own and I would follow. So  I send 
Jerry 
over for the Œ a year to 
Israel
 to study, he loved it. 
And the only mistake that 
they made is, when he applied 
to  law school, he applied to 
Israel
 and they to ld him, 
finish first, and then come. When he fi
nished and he got ma
rried, th ey said, now 
you have to go back to scho
ol. I was hoping that he wou 
Œ they would go on their 

 
Interview with Bella

53
own and then I would follow. 
But now it™s difficult that they
 all settled here, for me 
to pick up and go. I love 
Israel
, my husband loves 
Israel
. It™s not that I don™t love 
America
, I love it here too, but there it™s a d i
fferent type of living. And I really 
would en joy it there maybe better than here. 
But the thing that th
e children are here, 
and mo st of all my  grandchildren, I couldn™t stay away from. 
Q: What changes have you noticed in 
relations between American Jews and 
Israel
, 
over the years? 
A: Well, in the beginning th e Jews that went to 
Israel
, they were more Zionist type. 
They  were hardwork ing people, they really
 were depending on 
American fund that 
they were getting, and they were living differe
nt life, very hard life. Like the people 
who come from 
Europe
, when they started here life 
wa-was difficult, for them it 
was 10 times harder. They had to live like in 
DP
 camps after they were in 
Isr ael
, 
and after 
Israel
 was declared a state, because they
 had no facilities th ere. And they 
worked really very 
hard. Today it™s a very beautiful 
country. They 
work less t h an 
here. They  have a mo re normal life as far as
 social life, and they traveling a lot. 
They are not settled as much 
as the American people are settled. They take life in 

day by day because all the time 
so mething happens in there.
 And they want to grab 
them whatever they can while they™re alive. So that™s 
why th ey are mo re loose in 
traveling and more loose in life in 
Israel
 than here. Life in 
Israel
 is beautiful.

Q: How has your experiences in the Ho loca
ust influenced choices that you™ve made 
over the years? 
A: Well, I™m ver Œ I™m very close with
 the family. I™ve always protected the 
children, I was always afraid something th
at™s gonna happen. Wh en  they were small 
I used to get up from bed at night while 
they were sleeping to listen if they™re 

breathing. I was so surrounded wi
th dead people, that
 if they didn™t cry, or they to Œ 
they were sleeping, I went to see if th
ey™re alive. So it was fearful no matter how 
long and no matter how much time after it ha
ppens. Would the chil
dren or even the 
grandchildren, I watched them today. If I 
go over there, whatever they do, I said, 

you do th is, now your Mommy  and Daddy™s hom
e, not when I™m ar
ound you. They 
Œ they Œ cause they are 
daring, the children are daring. Mine, I kept them 
[indecipherable]
 cause I was Œ I was always afra
id something sh ouldn™t happen.  
Q: In retrospect, do you th
ink you would have done 
something, or anything 
differently if you were raising them today? 
A: I don™t think so. I still think that they 
should know more res-respect for others. I 
Œ I believe that today the children are raised
 a little too loose Œ in most of the places, 
not all. Some of the children, the parents,
 you know, have a lot of things, they run 
around, th ey don Œ they  have strangers wa
tching the children. I don™t approve of 

 
Interview with Bella

55
that. I believe if you have children you go
tta be with them and raise them. Hired 
help is not th e same
 as you do yourself. 
Q: Do you speak with your 
sons about your Holo caust expe
riences in Œ in the past 
now Œ now that they™re all adu
lt and parents of their own? 
A: They don™t ask too many qu
estions lately. I think they are all up to date with it. 

They all belong to the gath
ering, they all get the newspapers. But the Œ my little 
grandchildren start to ask now. I have 
[indecipherable]
 and I have three little o n es. 
One is named after my  husband™s mo ther 
and sister. The other one is named after 

my aunt and my grandmother, and the littleone is named after my husband™s father. 

And they all Œ we got all three names, 
and they™re after the Holocaust survivors 
[indecipherable]
. And even  her parents, they ne
ver requested a name, they Œ I™m 
sure they have deaths on th eir family too, 
but they sti Œ they kept on telling my son, 
if that means so much, the names, to your 
parents, give it to them. So we have all 
three names in there. And the children now, 
the older one is seven. She starts asking 
questions. She didn™t ask til now, but now 
she already knows why sh e™s named after 
her mo ther and why she perished, 
and she starts asking questions. 

Q: Do you talk with y
our older grandchildren about your experiences? 
A: 
[indecipherable]
 claims he knows. He follows it in school, and he™s reading 
about it, and he gets some in
formation in th e computers.

Q: Is that satisfactory for you? 
A: If they Œ whatever they as
k me, if they ask me, I™d be 
happy to talk to them. But 
just to sit down and starting stories about 
that, I don™t bring it up. If they don™t bring 
it up, I don™t bring it 
[indeciphera ble]
 
Q: Does it bother you that 
they don™t ask you mo re? 
A: No. I figure they know 
about it. If they wouldn™t 
know, and what they don™t 
want to know, then it would bother me, but 
they all know about it. I never kept it a 
secret and they never kept it a secret. They
 all know that they 
are sur Œ that they 
children of survivors a
nd th ey know about it. 

Q: Do you speak publicly 
about your experien ces? 
A: In a group for me, in the 
Hadassah
 occasionally, or in the 
Œ or in the sisterhood, 
if they have questions, or things like th
at. My husband spoke occasionally in city 
hall about it. But not going ou
t strongly, like many people do. 
Q: Are you involved  with any survivor groups? 
A: I belong to the groups, I get newspa
pers. I have an Œ wh-w hen they had th e 
gatherings in ™81 in 
Israel
, we went and made a tape there, in 
Yad Vashem
, I get 
mail from them, I belong to  that group. I belong to  the mu seum in here. I get the 

newspapers in it and all the things that™s
 happening. We have
 Œ occasionally we 
have, in our area they have, in a church  th
ey  have a gathering ever year about the

Holocaust. And they have the interracial gr
oups talking ab out it and singing Hebrew 
songs, and I attend them.  
Q: Have you had any recurri
ngdreams since the war? 
A: Many times. 

Q: Can you tell me? 

A: I just feel sometime
s like I™m slipping in 
bed. I™m sleeping, an d 
[indecipherable]
 I slip, that somebody™s behind 
me. And then when I wake up, I 
get ch-chills all over my body.
 Many times I dream I™m in 
Auschwitz
,  man y  ti mes I 
dream I™m Œ I am carrying the 
ammunition, it explodes in front of me. I see th e war 
constantly, that™s so
mething that doesn™t go out of your mind. 
[indecipherable]
 
even if you think or you don
™t think about it. Especially for like I speak about it 
now, it™s gonna be a couple of weeks til I still gonna see it in front of me. 

Q: Regard ing your life in this country, wh at
 has been the best surprise about life in 
America
, and/or, wh at has been th e biggest disappointment about life in 
America
? 
A: My best surprise are my
 grandchildren. I adored  my
 children, but nothing like 
my  grandchildren. This is th
e Œ this is the real dividends
. And that™s the reason that 
I ben Œ th at I don™t go too far away, and I 
always want to be in touch with them. 
Q: Is there, perhap s, a single disappoi
ntment about your life 
in this country? 
A: Not really. I think I got
 more than I expected.

Q: What would you yet like to accomplish? 
A: I would like to see them grow up, my
 grandchildren and 
be happy and attend 
good schools and be in the right side of
 the street. Know where they™re going and 
where they™re coming. I always want them 
to know where th-the roots are coming. 
Q: What are your plans for your golden  years? 

A: I really haven™t made too many plans.
 I just hope I™ll be well to travel a little 
more. My husband loves to travel, I don™t. I 
Œ I love mami Œ my  Œ my  bed. I love to 
be home, and I love to get comp any home. Travel it Œ I find it Œ I 
[indecipherable]
 
I Œ we™re wandering so much around befo
re that now to me sometimes is a 
punishment to travel, I hate it. Bu
t I™m going because he loves it.  
Q: What would you like your sons and you
r grandchildren to 
know about you that 
maybe they don™t already know? 
A: I really have no id ea what I would lik
e them to know. I really don™t know. 
Q: Is there anything that we didn™t disc
uss that you would like to talk about, before 
we finish the interview? 

A: I don™t know if I mention it to 
you, my  sister we brought over from 
South 
America
 with her fami ly, and sh e lives in our area now. I had Œ and she also has 
chil Œ two daughters who got married and th
ey are involved w
ith the Holocaust a 
lot. The children and the grandchildren, th
ey all know. Matter of fact, the dau Œ the

granddaughter wrote an article that was

And that™s about all. 
Q: Anything else you™d like to add? 
A: It was nice knowin g you, I made a lot 
of friends through th
