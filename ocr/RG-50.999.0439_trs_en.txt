Esther was born in Germ any, to where

in Adelsheim, atown north of Stuttgart, to which the arrow pointsonthis map.

Jewish pogrom , known as Kristallnacht, the night 
of  broken glass, instigatedprim arily by Na zi party off icialsand Nazi Storm T roopers, took place. T he 

pogrom  tookplacethroughoutGermany, parts of  Czechoslovakia and Austria.  In thisphotograph,

Concerned about the saf ety of
 
theirf am ily, the Rosenf elds registered their childrenfor a 
Kindertransport, the inform alnam eof  a rescue effort thatbroughtthousands of refugee Jewish 
children to Great Britainf rom  Nazi Germ any between 1938

1940.  
 
 
Esther wore this tag attached to her clothing as she traveledf rom  her hometown of  Adelsheim , 
Germ any, toT horpe, Norwich, England, to join herfosterfam ily, theHarrisons.  
 
 
W eclose with this picture of Esther with herEnglish fosterfam ily, Alan, Dorothy and Harry

Esther,thank you so much for joining us,for being so willin g to beour 
Fi rs t  P e rs o n
 
today and 
to have fam ily m em bers here.W e're really gl ad to have all of  you. 
 
 
Esther, we're going to start, because we have an hour, you have so m uch to share.  You were 

 
ROUGH DRAFT  T RANSCRIPT

ver y young when your parents went toEngland, I think2 years when you went to England,2 years of  
age.  Although you're too young to share with us your directm em ories of  life in Germany, perhaps 
you can share with uswhat you learnedf rom your sisters and what you gatheredover the years 
about what yourf am ily lif e was like, what your town was like in those years before the war, and 
bef ore you were sent to England.  
 
>> Esther Starobin:  I def initely don't rem ember.  I have learnedmuchf rom m y sister, Bertl.  My other 

two sisters didn't really talk about itm uch, soI didn't learn muchf rom  them .  
 
 
Also, there's a man in Germ any, we com ef rom  a little place called Adelsheim, which you saw 
in the slide,and he has over the years beencollecting inf ormation about the Jews that live d in that 
area.  He is not Jewish, but it's his interest.  So if  Ihave a question,which I of ten have af ter doing a 
F i rs t  P e rs on
,I sendhim  an e
-
m ail, andhe will research it. 
 
I was just recently in Germ any and visited with Reinhart.  He has a collection in his 
basem ent.  He knows so muchabout the Jewish f am iliesof  Adelsheim f rom  the people he hears 
f rom ,because like usm any have gone backto try tof ind out information.  He has kept records and 
has collectedfam ily trees.  Hehas som uch inform ation.  It's really am azing to see som eone that 
interested inthis,but he really is.  
 
 
Anyhow, Adelsheim  isa very sm all place. It's still a small place.  It has one traff ic light, s
t ill.   
Andm y parents hadmoved there af ter they were married in1926 and af ter Bertl was born. My f ather 

hadbeen inW orldW ar I and lost a leg.  He had trainedas a young persontobea baker,but you 
can't really be a baker when you can't stand on your
 
legs for too long.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  He had f oughtf or theGerman arm y?  
 

 
ROUGH DRAFT  T RANSCRIPT

>> Esther Starobin:  Yes, and lost a leg then.  He was a cattle dealer.  My m other'sfam ily haddone 
cattledealing. This is all stuff If ound out later.  He sold grainto thefarmers around there.  
Occasionally, he would trade work on a horsekind of trade, that kindof  thing.  
 
 
W hen the weather was bad, I gather,m y m other would go out with him ,becausehe couldn't 
alwa ys m anagethe cart by him self  whentheweather was really ba
d .  
 
 
As you saw in thepicture, there were f ive of us; I was the youngest. According toBertl they 
hada happy childhood.  In fact, once I was wi th Bertl in Germ any, we went back because there was a 
comm em oration,andBertl was talking to other people who hadbeen inf irst grade with her. T hey 
rem em beredeach other.  It was really interesting.  
 
 
So all of this kindof  stuff Ifoundout.  My father's brother lived in Adelsheim and helped him  
som ewhat in the graintrade,untilhe came tothe UnitedStates
 
in 1937.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  You mentionedthat Adelsheim  was a sm all town. How large was the Jewish 
comm unity there?  
 
>> Esther Starobin:  About 10f am ilies. T here was a synagogue there which hasbeen destroyed.  
But inthe next town over, Senf eld, the
 
synagogue building is still standing and there'samuseum  that 
has inform ationabout the Jewish com munity, and in between Senf eld and Adelsheim ,hidden away to 

go up a drivewa y, there's a Jewish cem etery, which actually Reinhart, thisman, has kept in goo
d 
condition.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  He takes careof  the cemetery?  
 

>> Esther Starobin:  He does.  
 

 
ROUGH DRAFT  T RANSCRIPT

>> Bill Benson:  How large was your extendedf am ily?  Five children in your immediatefamily. W hat 
about the extended f am ily?  
 
>> Esther Starobin:  Both of m y parents, there were 10 sibblings in each family.  My f ather's fam ily 

lived in another little town in thatarea,that had beenthere sincethe 1700s.  My m other cam ef rom a 
little ways off .  I can't think of the name of the place right now.  T hey lived therefor a while.  There'sa 
bookaboutthe Jewish cem etery; I can't thinkof  the name of the place. There's abook about the 
Jewish cem etery, and in there I canf ind the gravestonefor m y maternal grandparents.  Sothat's very 
interesting to s
e e tha t.  
 
 
I have no mem ory of any of these people. It's kind of hard to connect topeople that you don't 
really have a m em ory.  The nam es,they're not peoplethat Ihave any wa y of  knowing.  It'sthe same 
for m y parents. Bertl andm y other sisters occasionally would tell stories, mostly aboutm y father, not 
so muchaboutm y m other, but I can't put it with aperson. They're stories I've heard.  It's not a 
personI know.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Hitler came topower in 1933.  Do you know how yourf ather's busi
ness fared during 
th a t tim e?   
 

>> Esther Starobin: W ell, in 1934 som ebody suedhim to say he had solda bad horseor done 
som ething, and it was the beginning of  trying to closedown the Jewish businesses.  Ultimately, the 
business was closed and taken away f rom him . Actually, that presented aproblem  to thefarm ers in 
thatarea, because they dependedonthe Jewish m erchantstobuy theirf eed, and they didn't have a 
good way of  getting their feed.  So there was a bad resultf rom  that, asidefrom what it di
d to the 
f a m ilie s .

>> Bill Benson:  Bertl is 12 years older than you, I believe.  
 
>> Esther Starobin:  Right.  
 
>> Bill Benson: W hat's the rest of the age range?  
 
>> Esther Starobin:  Bertl is theoldest. Ediewas a year and a halfyounger.  Ruth was
 
seven years 
older thanI.  My brother was f our years older.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Kristallnacht, Novem ber 9 and 10, 1938, was a, if  Ican use the word, a crystalli zin g 
eventf orm any Jews in  Germany who knew an already intolerable situation,many believed it
 
would 
only get worse.  It motivated your parents and others tothinkabouthow to rescueand save their 

fam ilies.T hat led them  to makethe decision tohave you and your siblings leave Germ any.  T ell us 
what you can,both about what Kristallnachtm eantfor yourf am ily, to the extent that you know, 
knowing how young yo u were, and then secondly how they began to planf or your departure.  
 
>> Esther Starobin:  OK.  In Adelsheim , the synagogue was destroyed.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  On Kristallnacht?  
 
>> E s t h e r  S t
arobin: This I know f rom  Reinhart.  My parents' housewas not on the main street, so 
they weren't disturbed.  But other Jewish m en were takenout, things done to them.  My sisters by that 
tim e were no longer living in Adelsheim because they were not allowed to go to school anym ore.  
T hey had gone,once to one set of aunts,then had to move again. T hey were in Aachen, livin g with 
two aunts. Unlike today, there wasn't all this im mediate news.  So they set off to go to school, and 
they saw the synagogue burning.  They were told to go hom e, they went hom e.  
 
 
W hat they've told m e about living with m y aunts in Aachen, they wer e there about six m onths, 
som etimes there would be people in the apartm ent at night, in themorning they were gone.  They

surm ised m y aunts were helping people to escapef rom Germ any, that they were doing that. T hat 
was the beginning of the Kindertransport.  People in England wentto the parliam ent to see about 
bringing children, rescuing some children. So it was arranged thatchildren could come wi thout their 
parents toEngland. There hadtobem oney putupfor their reimm igration, and then people cam e to 
Germ any to help establish and setupa system  of ways of f inding these children.  
 
 
Bertl, Edith and Ruth lef t Germ any in March1939.
  
W ehad an aunt in London who worked as 
a dom estic, because that was what you could do if  you were an imm igrant, and shefound hom esfor 
Bertl, Edith and Ruth.  They were all in different places. Bertl was wi th
 
--
  
>> Bill Benson:  Before you go to that,
 
your three sisters left in March. T hey went bef ore you? 
 
>> Esther Starobin:  Yeah.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Do you have any knowledge of  why you went later? 
 

>> Esther Starobin:  Iwas in a diff erentplace. T hey were in Aachen.  I don't know
 
--
 
m y go i n g i s
 
a 
big m ystery.  I can't seem  tof ind outhow I went. Clearly, if  you're 2 years old you can't go ona train, 

a boat, whatever by yourself.  So obviously, s om ebody was looking outfor me, butI don't know how.  
Of all things Reinhart found out, that isn't
 
one of  them . I assume with Bertl,Edieand Ruth, they took 
care of  each other.  
 

>> Bill Benson:  Bertl is probably about 14 when you went, about14 years of  age.  
 
>> Esther Starobin: W hat Edith rememberedwas when they crossed the lineout of Germany 
into 

Holland,Belgium ?  Iforget which.  Belgium . T hey got food.  My sister Edie likedf ood.  She 
rem em bers gettingf ood. T hen they went

Bertl lived with some people who Ithink were originall y in

London, but thentheywent to Scotland and lived in Scotland.  Shewent to school inScotlandfor a 
while. W hen she was 16, she wentback to London to live with m y auntand go to work.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  If  your sisters went in March,when did you go?  
 
>> Esther Starobin:  I went in June.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  And Ithink you mentioned one time that you think that the Quakers were invol ved in 

arranging the accommodates.  Do you know anything about that
 
--
 
in arranging theKindertransports?  
Do you know anything about that?  
 
>> Esther Starobin:  Def initely they were invo lved in arranging f orme.  I wenttoLondon, aQuaker 
l a d y,  Mrs .
 
Edmunds, metm e inLondon, then to Norwich, thenI don'tknow what m eans to my f oster 
parents inT horpe.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Fromwhat I understand,there were individuals who came f rom England to escort 
you, accom pany you back toEngland, to take the kids, to be like chaperones, as you went. 
 
>> Esther Starobin:  Right.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Ultim ately, 10,000 children were able to go?  
 
>> Esther Starobin:  10,000, yes.  
 
>>
 
Bill Benson:  England was somewhat unique inthat role, weren'tthey?  
 
>> Esther Starobin: They were.  My brother cam e tothe United States in1941. The United States 
allowed 1,000 childrenin, in 1941.  A program called AT housand Children.  Hehad been in camps 
with m y parents and cam e, but he didn'ttalkabout it.

>> Bill Benson:  He was one of a thousand, and you were partof  the 10,000 that went to England.  
Do your sisters, do you know, did they tell you over the years more about what it was like to go on the 
Kindertransport?  
 
>> Esther Starobin:  No.  Not atall.  No.  Inever heard muchabout it.  I don't know if  you heard 

f r om
 
--
 
no .   
 
>> Bill Benson: T here you are by June of 1939, thefour of you are in England.  
 
>> Esther Starobin:  Right
.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Separate places. T ell usallabout that.  
 
>> Esther Starobin:  I lived with a fam ily.  Thefam ily I lived with, the husband worked in a shoe 
factory owned by a Jewish m an, andheputa sign uponthebulletin board,"Anybody willi ng to take 
oneof  these children that are com ing"  so that's how they got me.  
 
 
Bertl lived with peoplecalled Pooles.  My sister lived with af am ily wi th daughters in London, 
then at some point was taken away f rom  them  to ahostel.  My sister Edie lived with
 
a  f am ily in  
London, then whenthey were taking all of  thechildren outof  London, she was sent to som eoneout in 

the country, but she wasn't allowed to go to school. She hada pretty hard time of  it, actually.  She 
thought she was treated like a slave.  
 
>> Bill Benson: W emay talk m ore aboutthat.  Do you have any sense of  why you were separated, 

four separate ways, as opposed to trying to keep siblings together in some capacity?  
 
>> Esther Starobin:  I think it would be hard tof ind afam ily to take inf our children.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Or three or two, I guess.  
 
>> Esther Starobin: The people I lived with certainly couldn'thave donethat.

>>
 
Bill Benson:  I'm  tryi ng to imagine, I im agine the audience too,four of  you separatedf rom  your 
parents, you go to another country, another culture,another language.  Then you're dividedf our ways 
there. You're infour separate homes. 
 
>> Esther Starobin:  Right.  Now, m y Aunt Hannah knew where we were.  Bertl knew.  I guess Edith 

knew. W eall knew.  Notm e, I was too little.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  You didn't know.  
 

>> Esther Starobin:  I didn't know those things.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  In a little while you'll tell us about your lif e with the Harrisonf am ily.  You're going to 

describe itas a happy tim e. Is that the sam efor your siblings?  
 
>> Esther Starobin:  No.  Idon't think so.  Bertl, as I said, wentto school in Scotlandf or awhile.  I 
think that was all right. She was ina play. T hat's the only thing I've ever heard about her going to 
school in Scotland, she was in a Shakespeare play. W hen she was back in London oneday, the 
police cam e tothe door and asked her if
 
--
 
gave her some name. It tu
rned out Mr.
 
Poole was a 
Germ an spy.  Hehadbeen looking, watching theplanes com e over Scotland and reporting back. 
 
>> Bill Benson: T he host f amily?  
 
>> Esther Starobin:  Yeah.  W hat a great cover, you have this littleGerman kid living with you.  
 
>
> Bill Benson:  German Jewish kid.  
 
>> Esther Starobin:  My sister Edie was not good.  She was ver y unhappy with where shewas.  She 

joinedtheAT S,theW om en's Arm y, as soonas she was old enough.  Infact, when she was in the 
arm y she went back to Germany, and she went to Adelsheim  after the war.  She was walki ng down 
the street, and som ebody spoke to her, she looked just like inthe pictures.  She got usourbirth

certif icates so we knew where we were born.  
 
 
But she really had abad time inEngland.  Now, when Bertl startedworkin g at 16, she was 
tryin g to sendm oney to ourparents,and she knew thatthey had been deported when the letters and 
them oney came back.  She was a kid trying to sendm oney to Germany.  That's kindof  hard todo.  
 
 
Ruth had a
 
bad tim e. Shedidn't like it inLondon.  She didn't likethe hostel.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  You say hostel,m y im age isyouth hostels where kids traveling stay.  
 
>> Esther Starobin: This was a placethey stuck kids with noplaceelse to put them.  
 
>> B i l l
 
Benson: T em porary orphanages?  
 
>> Esther Starobin:  Like that. Shef inishedwhatever schooling she could have, was working, then 
cam e here to high school, college. She was a very determ ined lady.  
 
>>
 
Bill Benson:  Here you are in England,four diff erent places. Youdescribed your parents when 
you left were in Adelsheim . Tell us what youknow about what becam e of your parents, and of  course 
you told us your brother came later,but he was still with your parents. T em  us what you know about 
their circum stances in that tim e.  
 
>> Esther Starobin: W ell, they had trouble getting food.  Oneof  thethings that happened, Jewish 

people didn'thave the ration book, they couldn't getfood. T he timeBertl and I were in Germ any, we 
m et two different people who said they had helped ourparents getfood.  I said to Bertl,W ho knows if  
that'strue?  After the war, you can say anything that you want. 
 
Bertl said shehad gotten lettersf rom  our mother that said that
 
they had helped.  One 
personhad broughtf ood andput it on the steps atnight, andhetold us his wif e was

his m other

som ething would happen to them.  
 
 
T he otherperson saidthey traded goods, whatever our parents had, they traded itforfood.  So 
they were there until Octoberof  1940, and inOctober of 1940 the Jews in Baden were all roundedup, 
gi ven ver y short tim e, a f ew hours, to pack one suitcase each, an
dthen they were taken to Germ any.  
T hey were taken to work cam ps there, Herm an with them .  
 
 
Oneof  our aunts was there. W edon't know quite how com e, but she was there too.  My aunt 
worked in the kitchen, so I think she could get food to Herman a little
 
b it.  
 
 
Herm an cam ehere in1941; he was 8, 9.  He never talked about it. He absolutely ref used to 
have anything todo,to talk about it.  His girls didn't really know.  Herm an had lived with anaunt and 
uncle that he calledmom  and dad,and his daughters didn't really know that they weren't their 
grandparents, until this loud
-
m outhed niece told them . So Herman, it wasn't something he could talk 
about.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  How he som ehow was ext ric atedf rom  a camp andtaken, you don't know the

I don't know.  Herm anabsolutely never talked about it.  On the shipm anifest, it says that he 
knew how to readandwrite Germ an and French. W here did he learn it?  He couldn't go to school in 
Adelsheim .T hey didn't let Jewish kids go toschool. Did they have school in the cam ps? My parents 
knew Germ an, but who taught him  French?  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Clandestine classes where he learned?  
 
>> Esther Starobin:  Did he really know French?  School was nothis favorite thing asa teenager.  I 
don't really know.  T here are so many questions, and it'shard, there's noone you ca

this happen? How doyou know this?" W edon't know all of that stuff.

outof  there,and she believed in God.  God would look outfor them . 
 
>> Bill Benson: T hat com es across in the letters?  
 
>> Esther Starobin:  Oh, yeah. At some point, she says to Bertl, " Keep your clothes. I am so small 

now, I can wear your clothes."  Bertl was 16. My m other was 30
-
som ething.  She could wear her 
clothes.  But she talksabout som e of the things that are happening. 
 

 
T he other thing shedoes in this letter, she says to Bertl, who is notanywhere near us, 
" Make 
sure your sisters behave, they say thank youto the people who aretaking care of them , they wash 

behind their ears."   All of the things that you tell kids in anorm al lif e.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Kids who have gone to cam pfor the sum mer, yourm other is
 
doing this?  
 
>> Esther Starobin:  "Tell them  to do their wor k."   I think it was pretty amazing.  But that's really the 

only thing that I actually know of  m y mother. I know f rom Bertl's stories m y father was strict.  She had 
a scooter once,and he broke itbecause he was af raid she'd hurt herself on it.  He'd ring a bell or a

>> Esther Starobin:  Oh, I was spoiled rotten.  They had one son,Alan, who when I got there was 9.  

T hey had wanted another boy to goalong with their son,but they got me instead. W hen If irst got 
there,I had scarletfever, so I was in isolation, and Alan would playwith me through the windows.  I 
was af raidof  loudnoises, of men's voices, things like that.  
 
 
T hey were ver y devout fundam entalist Christians. They belonged to a chapel, which in 
Englandm ost people are Church of England,but very, ver y f undamentalist.  
 
 
Uncle Harry worked in the shoef actory.  T hey had moved tothe country because they gre w 
vegetables, they had chickens. He rode hisbike intohis jobevery day in Norwich.  At lunchtim e he

I was ver y, ver y, ver y m uch part of theirfam ily.  I knew I wasn't, butI was.  They were ver y 
active in the chapel, which had all kinds of things to make com munity.  Now we talk about in our 
churchesand synagogues how im portant com munity is. W ell, they had com munity. T hey had a lot of 
a c t ivit ie s ,  a ll o

was a little kid.  I don't think Im et any other Jewish kids in Norwich. What I learned since then, there 

were 200 Kindertransport kids in that area, but I didn't know any of them .

>> Bill Benson:  You described them  as really good people.  
 
>> Esther Starobin:  Oh, yeah. But they never raised their voice, they never yelled, they didn't do any 
of  thosethings, which is notto say Auntie Dot didn'thave a way of getting her way, she did, but it 
wasn't through yelling.  
 
 
It was peacef ul,and out in the country it was ver y peacef ul, other than air raids.

I was ver y happy there.  Then oneday af terthe war, in 1947, we got passage to go, to com eto 
this country.  The Harrisons didn'thave a telephone. Bertl called the policeandasked them  to com e 
to the Harrisonsand tell them they had to bring m e to London thenext day, which of  course they had 
to  do .

>> Esther Starobin:  I didn't know bef ore how it happened. T here was something calledBloom sbury 
Ho
use in England thatlooked af ter the ref ugees, kept trackof us. Som ebody once came to the 
school to talk tom e, to m ake sure I wasn't being m istreated.  I was supposedtobe getting som e 

Jewish education. The pastor of the church they belonged to, Mr.
 R
am sey, knew Hebrew and all of  
that stuff.  He was supposed to be teachingm e, but I'm  very inept at languages, so I wasn't really 

learning too much.T hey did check, Bloom sbury House.  
 
 
Inf act, a couple years ago, we got the records f rom Bloom sbury House. They had a lot of 
information on us.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  On you personally?  
 
>> Esther Starobin:  Us personally, eachof  us.  Notnecessarily accurate, but they had inform ation.  
 
[Laughter] 
 
>> Bill Benson: W hy the United States?

lived in Adelsheim ,
 
cam e in 1937, in February, two m onthsbefore Iwas born. T hey were here. That 
was why we were com ing here.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Do you know, you wouldn't have possibly known about the relatives here,was Bertl 
because of her age, still a kid, teenager, did she know where the relatives were in the United States 
to m ake connection?

>> Bill Benson: W as it hard to leave the Harrisons after eight years?  
 

>> Esther Starobin:  Oh, m y goll y, yes.  It was hard to leave them ,to com e to a place sodifferent.  
T horpe, where I lived, was a tiny little place. Cam etoW ashington,DC, which is not a

noisy street.  A lot of  pe
ople in the house.  They yelled and scream ed.  It was not good.  
 
 
I went toa com pletely different kind of  school.  I didn't know anything about being Jewish,so I 
was in a Jewish place. Everything was reall y different. It was complete change.  I would have been 
ver y happy not to have been there. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Before we continue on, takeus back to when you lef t the Harrisons. Do you recall 

going to London to join up with your sister and go?  I think Alan accom panied you. There's a story 
there.  
 
>> Esther Starobin: There is.  Uncle Harry couldn't take off work to go, but Alan and Auntie Dot took 
m e.  Alan was supposed to be getting abig honor at his schoolthatday, which of course he didn't go 
to. W hat Alan has told m e, thathis mother's hair turned white thatday, she was so upsetby it.  You 
know, it was 60

went with Bertl to the ship. T hey came to see us off.  
 
 
So we sailedon theQueen Mary, which is not as luxurious as it sounds.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Ithad been atroop ship, right?  
 
>> Esther Starobin:  Yes. There was a strike that day, but luckily Bertl had aboyf riend who was a 
butcher, andhehad given her salam i andm y aunt gave bread, andthey gave the kidsm ilk.  I was 
m iserably seasick. I hated it.  I'm not so sure Bertl wanted to comeeither. W edo what we're told. 
 
>> Bill Benson: T he transition, move in with an aunt and uncle

It was hard to get apartm ents in those tim es,but we did. T hey got an apartment. W e lived together.  
 
 
My sisters, who were new im migrants trying t o make their way in a new country

Bill Benson: T hey're young adults.

early 20s, hadm e to take careof . Som etim es they were dating people who 
were teaching schoolwhere I went. W e lived in oneapartm entfora while, then moved closer into 
town.  The thing of  it is, that Ialways f ind so am azing, it never occurred to me thatI couldn't go to 
college.  My sisters never said, " You can't goto college. "  You went to college. That was it.  
Probably because Ifailed typing and shorthand, but I was really badat tha
t stuff .  Bu t it's p re tty 
am azing, if you think about it, Edie went, Ruth went to college, I went to college. Edie when she was 
older got her high school GED and took classes atAmerican U. Bertl is theonly one who didn't, but 
she's probably smarter than all of us.  That was the way it was.  
 
 
Losing your parents and moving to another country is an awful thing. On the other hand,I was 
blessed.  I lived with people who truly loved m e in England and I had these sisters who really were 

wonderful.  So it's
 
a lot of  different things.  
 
>> Bill Benson: T he Harrisons, you kept relationshipsup with them. Tell us about the Harrisons and 

your relationship with them over the years.  
 
>> Esther Starobin:  Yeah.  W ell, the year I graduatedf rom college I went back.Well, Bertl and Edith 

usedto send packages to Aunt Hannahand to Norwich, I don't know who else to, because it was still 
ver y hard to getfood in England. T hen at som epoint Aunt Hannahstarted sending packages to us, 
and she would send, Idon't know
 
where she thought we were living, this long wool underwear, but

she never packaged itvery caref ully.  I was akid in high school, I had to stop atthe post office, so 
em barrassing, with the long underwear hanging out. 
 
 
Her lif e was hard, I think.  At some point, she,Aunt Hannah, co
-
owned ahouse with another 
m an, because she couldn't own it inher name in England. But theHarrisons, I always

Bertl and 
Edie always m ade sure I kept contact, that Iwrote tothe Harrisons.  The year I graduatedf rom  

co
llege I spentm ost of the summer with AuntHannah, butI visited in Norwich.  
 
 
W hen I got married and we had kids, we went over to visit when thekids were like 2, 3, or 3 
and4.  My kids always  considered the Harrisons grandparents. They knew they weren't their real 
grandparents, but they considered.T hey never consideredAlanuncle.  Alan was always ju st Alan.  It 
was so weird.  
 
 
W e wentbackandforth.  In 1964
-
65,Alan was a Fulbright teacher in this country.  So we 
brought hisparents over for the summ er,for,I don't know, f our weeks.  T hey were ver y
 
--
 
n o t 
backwards people,but sheltered people. They got on that planeand came here. W espent some 
tim e, we went to abeach in New
 
Jersey, whic h had mosquitos, and they got to see us.  Ithink our 
wa
y of  lif e was so diff erent, butthey were def initely part of ourfam ily and considered partof our 
f a m ily.   
 
 
W henm y kids gre w up, they went to visit.  My daughter Judy has two kids,and they went back 
to visit with the kids.  Very m uch a partof  thefam i

Now, the Harrisons have died, but Alan is still alive.

Bertl had written a letter to them  in

W e stayed at

were com ing up the stairs to getm e. T hey were probably right, I shouldhave stayed somewhere 
else. T he next day we  went back,this wom an translatedf orus, and there was an elderly m an, 
Mr.
 
W etterhan, who had known ourparents. T hey took us around, showed us thehouse, where the 
synagogue was.  T here's a museum  open once am onthor so; they opened it to show us. T ook usto

If elt likea visitor.  It didn't ring abell.  I didn'tfeel "Oh,I'mf inally hom e. T his is where I cam e

I came back, that was it.  Ihad beento Adelsheim .  I saw it, it's a real place, I really wasn't 
hatched, all that kind of thing. ThenBertl and Morris went in 1995, I think, and by that time 
Mr.
 
W etterhan wasn'tpersonally doing this Jewish history, it was Reinhart.  They had an interesting 
tim e;they liked Reinhart. 
 
Bertl rem em beredthings, which I didn't do.  
 
 
In 2000, we got a letter, it was probably an e
-
m ail,f rom  Reinhart, saying that they were having 
a com memoration, the60th anniversary of  the deportation of the Jews.  Bertland I both decidedthey 

needed Jews at this com memoration. Another niece,m y brother's daughter,decided to gowith us.  
W e wentback to Adelsheim  that tim e,and Bertl said, "I'll translate." First day she translated; after 
that, she was so busyspeaking Germ an, she didn'ttranslate a th

Shem et people she'dgone to school with, and apparently when inf irst grade som ebody had

T here was a comm emorationat this synagogue between the towns that Reinhart arranged, 
which was ver y m ovin g.  Peoplem ade speeches,diff erent peoplemade speeches.  He read one of 
the letters thatm y m other had sent. Bertlm ade a speech.  She tried, but she cried so som ebody else 
d id  it .  A ll in  G e rm a

was police outside,and there were about100 peoplethere.  Reinhart had put up an exhibit aboutall 

of  the Jewishf am ilies.  He didn't have govern m entm oney.  He arranged it, copiedthings on the 
copier.

W e went to the cemetery.  It's still in good condition. It's a Jewish tradition to put stones ona

a little kid. I didn't have todomuch to survi ve.  Bertl worked hard.  Once you gottoa 
certain age, you had to work in war effort kind of  things.  Edie did too, I think. Edith had wanted tobe 
a nurse, but thatdidn't work out.  Iforget, youhadtodo volunteer work too, didn't you?  So there 
were a lot of things that you had to do.  
 
>> Bill Benson: T hank you for the question. T hank you. A question here.  Got am icrophone

>> Kind of  interested in thef act that10,000 children were selectedfor this program in England.  I'm  

sure there were m any children inGermany who died becauseof  the Holocaust.  How was i t that 
people, certain children were selected, andothers didn'thave that opportunity?  
 
>> Esther Starobin:  I'm  not really sure. 
 
I would imagine, likem any other things, it depended if  you 
knew the process.  They didn't select, supposedly, they didn'ttake kids under 5, but clearly they did.  
Boys after a certain age, it was only to 17. And then it was cut off. It didn't last very long.  It started 
af ter Kristallnacht and ended when the war began. T here was oneKindertransport in
 
--
 
transport 
when the war began, and those peopleended up in Sweden.  I thinktherealso was not money, there 

weren't facilities.  
 
 
It's in te re stin g, 
because in Berlin, the only picture Itook onm y trip that turnedout is apicture, 
the Kindertransport statue,one end has two kids with a suitcase that was saved, theotherend isfour 
orf ive kids representing all of the kids that were not saved. Very m oving, and there were parents 
who didn't want their children to go separate. 
 
 
T here's an interesting m ovie, I don't know if you've seen it "Into theArms of Strangers,"  and it

tells the story of  10 differentpeopleon theKindertransport, and one, thef
ather snatched her out of  
the train at the lastm inute. It talks about that, and she ended up in several concentration cam ps but 
survi ved them.  
 
 
T hen there arepeople, a couplepeople they interviewed in this movi e who said they were m ad 
at their parentsfor sending, they wanted to stay with their parents.T o me it was anultimate sign of  
love.  Every f am ily is different. T here were over am illion kids killed in Germ any, Jewish kids.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  It's just so alm ost impossibleto imagine what it tookfor your parents to take, 

ultim ately, f ive children, butf irst thefour girls, and send you away to save you. W hatanextraordinary 
a ct.  
 
>> Esther Starobin: W ell, they thought they would getout too, at thebeginning. W hy did they save 

the boy, w
onderf ul boy?  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Any other questions?  
 
 
Esther, you told m e at one point that your

even though, because of  your age, you didn't 
really know your parents, you can't recallm uch about them , but yet youfeel like they've had a 

trem endous inf luenceon you, who you are. W ill you sharem ore about that with us?  
 
>> Esther Starobin: W ell, I think they sharedthefact that you do things for your fam ily outof  love, but 

they also, the im portance of fam ily, look atall m y f am ily that'shere.  That fam ily is ver y im portant, that 
looking outfor eachother, anddoing the best that you can in the circumstance, not always  to say 
" Oh, me, oh,poorm e," but " I cando this, I can do that."  Ithink it had a tremendouseff ecton us.  
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us about theKindertransport quilt. T hat was som ething I learnedf rom you about

>> Esther Starobin:  A few years ago, som ebody who was a quilter and was married to som ebody on 
the kinder, said why don't we get people tomake squaresthat represent their experiences and we'll 
m ake a quilt,and youwrite a little story about it.  
 
 
So Idid one.  It turned out they got enough squares, there are threequilts.  They're actually in 
a museum  in Michigan, I think, permanently in am useum . There'sa li
ttle  bo o kth at go e swith  it, with  
ever ybody's story.  Som eof the quilt piecesare absolutely gor geous.  I f igure they had som eone 

prof essionally do them.  
 
 
Mine hasthree hearts:My parents, m y sisters, the Harrisons intertwi ned, because I think that's 
w
h y I'm  hereand why I  am the way I am .

were raised by this greatf am ily.  I'm  wondering, like, having that experiencedo you think,
 
like, you 
would have adapted children yourself  inneed?  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Are you asking having beenadopted on a tem porary basis by the Harrisons?  I 
couldn't quite catch it.  Are you asking

I'm  asking, like, if  she would have adapted herself because shehad, like, such a really great 
experience.

>> Bill Benson:  Perm it m e, if  you had your own children, would you have considered adoption? Is 
that what you'reasking?  
 
>> Esther Starobin:  
Yes.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  Yes, yes.  
 
>> Esther Starobin:  In fact,I have one niecewho just adopted a child that they hadf osteredf or a 

couple of  years,and I have anothernephew, her brother, who has two adopted children that he 
adopted.  Yeah.

Benson: T hank you. W e're going to close now.  I want to rem ind youf irst that when Esther 
f inishes she's going to hustleupthe sides,because she's going to get out and sign copiesof  "Echoes 
of  Mem ory,"  which includesa com pilationof writings by sur vi vors a bout different partsof  their 
experience during the Holocaust and as survi vors.  I'm  going to turn, before Esther doesthat, back to 
Esther to close the program.  
 
I want to thank all of you for being with us today.  Rem ind you that we'll have

back to Esther to close before she heads upstairs.  
 
>> Esther Starobin: W hat I think is im portant, m ost of us can't inf luence hundredsof  people, but we 

can allhelpone or two people and it has a ripple effect.  I think if  you can helpone person,two 

people, you should doit.
