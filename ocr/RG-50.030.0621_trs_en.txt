Question: Good mo rning. 
Answer: Good morning. 

Q: This is a 
United States 
Holo caust Memorial Mu
seum interview with 
Fanny 
Aizenberg
 on April 21
st
, 2011. And
 Fa nny
, first of all, I Œ like I do on ev ery 
interview, I would like to thank you for gi
ving our Œ your time today to speak with 
us. But unlike every interview that we 
do, where normally I ask Œ and I will be 

asking th is later, I usually ask someone to 
start at the beginning, where were they 
born, what was their family lik
e, who were their mother a
nd father and so on. All of 
these things are very important. But I™d lik
e to start ours in a little different way, 
because before we started the Œ the inte
rview itself, we w ere talking about the 
process of it, and you were ac Œ you were 
telling me about some of the reservations 
that you had. So I™d like to 
talk about that a little bit, a
bout what is it like to speak 
with someone about these experiences that we
 are going to be talking about today. If 
you could share some of those thoughts with me. 
A: For me it™s very difficult to talk pub
licly, because of many reasons. I have heard 
many wo nderful speakers here at the mu seum, but all those people have been single 
people when the war started. I already ha
d a ch ild, and I already had responsibilities.

And we Œ it started out scary 
enough, and my  biggest problem also is, after so many 
years, I™m still living with th
e horrors I lived through in 
Auschwitz
. 
Q: So, in  other word s, every time you 
talk, there™s a cost, there™s a cost. 
A: Absu -absolutely right. Of course it is. 
Even today, which is so many years later, 
when I™m in a car, and I pass where there™s 
a railroad, I still break out in a sweat, 
which is not the polit Œ polite way of saying
. Because we had been
 for so long in the 
cattle train and I don™t think anybody has ev
er been able to fi
nd words what it was 
for three days and three nights, for 110 pe
ople, including babies, in a cattle train. 
The prayers, the screams, es
pecially from babies, is just
 indescribable, at least I 
cannot find the words fe
r Œ to describe such 
unhuman
 things.  
Q: Do you think Œ 
A: And we didn™t know what wa
s waiting for us at that time.  
Q: Were there Œ were there many years when
 you didn™t speak about your life at all 
in Œ about this Œ these aspects of your life? 
A: Well, I™ve only start Œ what is it
, Steven
, 10 years? 
S: Ten years ago. 
Q: 
Fanny
 is talking to 
Steven Vitto
 who is 
[indeciphera ble]
 
A: Yes, when he was always Œ and I was very lucky that my job was to sit with 

Steven, 
because of his kindness, of his ge
nerosity and caring. Don™t forget, 
Steven,
 
not because he™s a young person, we are fro
m such a different background and we

used to have conversations, 
like one human being should be
 fortunate to have with 
another one. 
Q: Tell me of Œ tell me a little 
bit about this, this is Œ y
ou started as a volunteer here 
at the museum, is this 
what you™re talking about? 
A: Yes. 

Q: And how is it Œ and wh at was 
Steve™s
 job? Wh at was his way of meeting you? 
What was Œ how did your in teractions start? 
A: Well, it really started that I saw in ﬁ
The Jewish Week,ﬂ 
which is a small 
magazine Œ 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: Œ advertised that the Holocaust Mu
seum needs volunteers. And one way or 
another, I was debating fo r a long, long time, and there™s a lot of things wh ich I 
didn™t care for to come here. And I have d
ecided I want to come and see what it is. 
And I am Œ was interview by somebody, wh
ich we connected very nicely. Her name 
is 
Jill
 and I don™t -- 
Coynburg
(ph) or 
Co henberg
(ph), I don™t remember her name. 
And somehow, we had a conversation that we
 understand each other. She said, look
 
Fanny
, you could start here right now, or 
you could wait for about two months 
when  we have a orientation. And I knew th
at if I would wait for an orientation, I 
would never come back. 

Q: You knew yourself well then Œ

nny  Aizenberg

A: So sh e say you could do Œ yes, I coul
d ch ange my  mind. I had many reasons for 
not wanting to come, like I had many reasons to do co me.  
Q: What were some of the r
easons for not wanting to come? 
A: There™s a lot of things I didn™t agree 
the way the things were working here. So I 
had the ch oice and I did not wait to be orie
nted. I felt I had been  oriented a lot, 
through the time I was Œ the Germans occupied 
Belgiu m
 and being in 
Auschwitz
, 
that was enough orientation. An yway
, I was very, very fortunate, I met
 Steven
, and 
immediately we connected very nicely. At 
the same time, I was 
translating a book 
from 
Belgium
, who just came out. This was a no Œ official book, how many 
transports they had from 
[indecipherable]
 how many people in each transport, how 
many people made into camp. What many pe
ople didn™t know, that many trains had 
gas and people were gassed in that
 train before they even got to 
Auschwitz
. 
Q: So as you were coming to 
Œ to work  at the mu seum as a volunteer, you were also 
translating this book 
at the same time? 
A: Yes, bes Œ 
Q: I™d like to stop Œ excuse me
 inter Œ for interrupting you 
Fa nny ,
 I™d like to bring 
Steve
 into this shot a little bit. Ca
n we do that? Is there a way for 
Steve
 to stand 
right here? 

Q2: Now, you want a two shot, I take it? 

Q: This looks like Œ this 
is two people in one shot? 

 
Interv iew with F a

Q2: This is a two shot. 
Q: That™s a two shot Œ 

Q2: Yeah , yeah. 
Q: Œ yes, at this Œ while 
Steve
 is in the frame, then yes. 
Q2: Keep  it on the tw o shot? 
Q: Yeah, keep it on the two shot, okay. 

Q2: Okay, that sounds good. All-righty-roo. 
Q: We™re ready? 
Q2: We™re all set now, uh-huh. 

Q: Okay. I™d like to introduce 
Steve Vitto
 to our co nversation, 
Fa nny
, and I™d like 
Steve 
to explain a little bit about what his job 
was here, and how it is that the two of 
you met and interacted. So
 Stev e,
 tell me a little bit about 
what you do, and how it is 
that your Œ your path  with 
Fa nny ™s
 crossed. 
S: I work in a department that was then  called the Holocaust S-Survivors Registry. 
We™ve since expanded, now we™re called 
the Holocaust Survivors and Victims 
Resource Center. And my  job then  and my  j
ob now is to ensure that the individual 
experiences of Holocaust survivors are firs
t recorded in our su
rvivors registry and 
then made available to people who are 
asking about them. So I bridge the gap 
between researching archives, but always in
teracting with the public in s Œ to find 

 
Interv iew with F a
nny  Aizenberg   
April 21, 2011

out what happened to  an individual and 
to help ensure that an individual™s 
experience in the Holocaust is
 recorded in some way. 
Q: By recorded, do you mean
 put in a database, or do you mean that like we™re 
doing an interview with 
Fa nny
 right now? 
S: It runs the gamu t, the primary focus 
then was the survivor
s registry, which is 
survivors or their families providing th at in
formation to us, since most people who 
went thro ugh th e Ho locaust did not have do
cumentation of that experience. So, to 
fill in that gap, we want people to come 
to us and provide that information that™s 
otherwise not available, and then we put th
at information into a database that can 
then be accessed by people coming throughthe museum, or calling us or writing me 
for that information. That™s one particular 
database and since then we also work with 
many other databases, including oral hist
ory collections, mo re online databases, 
digitized and also scanned image databases. 
Q: So tell me about how it is that 
Fanny
 and you first met. 
S: Well, we work in a registry, we work 
with su -survivor volunteers who come to us 
and they ™re very important, not only in giving 
us their testimony, but in helping us to 
arrange, put in data, to scan images and 
to help us in a variety of ways. And so
 
Fanny
 came to me as a volunteer from Œ she had mentioned our volunteer 
coordinator, 
Jill Weinberg
, and
 Fanny
 was able to do several Œ working with 
computers, she was able to pick up using 
our survivors registry. And we often get 

 
Interv iew with F a
nny  Aizenberg   
April 21, 2011 
 

 
 
9
requests not only for individual informati
on, but information ba
sed on place. So for 
instance, all the people who were from Œ in 
Theresienstadt
 for instance, 
concen tration camp, or from a particular to
wn, or share a ca Œ particular experience, 
and with our database, we™re able to push 
a few buttons and so  we can get not only a 
list of individuals, but individuals from a 
particular place. And I had a particular 
request for people wh o were Œ somebody 
wanted info rmation from those who were 

in 
Theresienstadt
, who were registered with us. And 
Fanny 
was able to help me to 
Œ I could set her up and so she could look thro ugh this list and produce it so that I 

could filter it a little bit and 
provide that information to 
another individual. That was 
one database. The other infor Œ info rma
tion Œ the other job 
she had was, since
 
Fanny 
speaks Belgian, we have a book that™s
 a list of the deportations that took 
place in 
Belgium
. And this particular collection 
is based on date, date of convoy 
only. And also, it was producing. It 
was Belgian, so it was in Belgian
. 
Q: Excuse me. I think in 
Belgium
 we have French and Flem
ish, as Œ as languages, 
so Œ 

S: Right. 

Q: So which language was it, of those two? 
S: This is in French, okay
, you™re right, you™re right. 
Q: It was in Fr
ench, okay, sorry.

S: But because of 
Fanny™s 
background in 
Belgium
, I thought it would be a good fit, 
and this Œ this informa
tion was in French, and 
Fanny 
looked through that. And 
before each Œ it™s divided by convoys, before each name list of those on the convoys 
is a description of th at co
nvoy, and Œ in French. And 
Fanny
 was able to translate 
those introductions, so that now people co
uld not only lo ok up th e names of those 
who were on those transports, but th ey coul
d also read, in English now, that general 
description of that transport. 
Q: But cle Œ thank you
,
 
Steve, 
because I Œ I Œ I think we needed  to get a sense of 
what was the structure of the volunteer pr
ogram, but clearly something mu ch  mo re 
happened. This was the specifi
c job, the sp ecific task, but
 wh en you met, something 
mu ch mo re happened  between you. And 
Fann y
, can you tell me what it is that you f 
Œ that you felt and that was an ongoin
g thing over the past several years? 
A: Because mainly, little by little, I was tellin g 
Steven
 my  background and my  
story. And he was kind, very to lerant, 
and listening. Also, wh
en we got the book 
from
 Belgium
, further descriptions, the number of trains, the number of people in 
the trains and how many transport, at the 
same time the mu seum got a book called 
ﬁThe Hidden Heroes
.ﬂ That book was written by a 
German reporter. She is from 
Germany
. She tried to interview peop Œ Jewish people in 
Germany
 and nobody 
wanted to give her any information. Some
how, she was so dete rmined, she came to 
Belgium
 and sh e got the real information, w
ith the names of the people from the

11
underground. The underground, the resistan
ce, they were also 
called the solidarity, 
and they  have pictures ri
ght here from that. So that book, and the one I was 
translating made mo re sense because you 
could put the two an
d two together. And 
that book wasn™t sellin g too well, and they
 had Œ she had to ch
ange the title, to ﬁ
The 
20
th
 Transport
.ﬂ And what makes it so interesting,
 that in the book, in that what 
mad e in  
Belgium
 more people survive, because 
the underground, Jewish people, 
non-Jewish people, any 
kind of people were just
 one group. Where in 
France 
they 
had a separate group of French people, a 
separate group of Jewish people, and the 

same thing has happened in 
Holland
. And this is why in 
Belgium
 only, because of 
such a dedication of so many unbelievable,
 brave, wonderful people, I can™t even 
find the names, who organized in convents, 
in churches and regular people, because 
of their caring and th eir dedication, 40
,000 Jewish people have surv ived  in
 Belgium
, 
including my  own child. 

Q: That™s amazing. 
A: So you see that combinatio
n, it was so wonderful that 
Steven
 was there for me to 
help 
[indecipherable]
.  
Q: So wou Œ 

A: And many of the wo rd
s from the documents from 
Belgium
, I did not know 
because I didn™t learn English of those documents. So 
Steven 
would Œ made sure I 
have a special dictionary, to have those 
[indecipherable]
 what anybody who wanted 

 
Interv iew with F a
nny  Aizenberg   
April 21, 2011 
 

 
 
12
to know. Another thing wh at we did is an
ybody passing by on the second floor, you 
just seen people running back  and forth, sp
ecially young students. So  we really Œ my  
job really was, can we help you? And we 
did, because once we 
had a French  person 
who was sent from a newspaper in  
France, 
with the picture from the room where 
you have all the pictures th
ere, and whoever he asked, 
th ey didn't  know wh at he 
wanted. And he passed a few 
times, til I had enough guts a
nd I asked if I help you? 
Then he said in French, no
body knows the answer. And he
 had a co py of the picture 
and the name of the newspaper he was repr
esenting. So  immediately if not sooner, 
Steven
 was able, through the computer, to ge
t the Œ all the information, which he 
typed for him to take. So he didn™t have 
to go to so many places, because he was 
originally  in the right place. So you see,
 you never know the contact you have with 
Steven
 in that particular place, because he
 knows the answ ers to everything.  
Q: Well, it Œ to me it sounds that here wh
en  you started volunteer
ing Œ I don™t want 
to put wo rds in your mouth, 
but this is the sort of thou
ghts that are 
c o min g  in to  my  
mind, is that there were aspects of the larg
er story th at was relevant to you because it 
had to do with the 
Belgian underg round. 
A: You™re right. 
Q: That you were finding 
out through this work, and th at through the work and 
through your interaction, little b
it your own story was coming up. 
A: Exactly, you™re right.

Q: And is Œ and is that what made it mo re comfortable for you to  now speak? 
A: Oh, more than just comfortable, beca
use I had the hard time when we came to 
America
 and I was still young, nobody from the 
family wanted to hear any of our 
stories, because they were afra
id they gonna have a headache. 

Q: That mu st have been  Œ 

A: So this was somebody I just got to kno
w, and I felt comfortable Œ there™s another 
word which is just more than
 comfortable, at ease, and 
we could talk, which is so 
unbelievable, which I haven™t done to such
 extent. Because this was always bottle 
up and still is, to many extent. 
[indecipherable]
 was very, very fortunate, and the 
same thing, thanks to 
Stev en.
 He made sure that I would 
be speaking up. He said, if 
you don™t do it now, wh en yo
u gonna do it? And I know I™m
 old, so I had to do it. 
But it just amazing how two people from such
 different backgrounds, different lives, 
have been ab le to have su
ch a wo nderful relationship. 
Q: 
Steve?  
A: Which is gonna be for me forever, becau
se we could talk about so many things 
and I™m very fortunate to have a young pe
rson who could understand our situations. 
So that™s why I say Œ 
Q: 
Steve
, we™re putting you on 
th e spot all right. 
A: No, I™m not. He knows I™m not. 
Q: Yeah, yeah.

A: So ever Œ so I Œ if I ever
 get a gold star, it belongs to 
Steven
. 
Q: 
Steve
, is there something you want
 to add to this, of your 
thoughts in the years as 
they™v e gone by, wh at you™ve learned from 
Fanny
 and through the relationship that 
developed between yo
u about her story? 
S: Oh my God. Well, the first thing I want
ed to say is I br Œ I wanted to push 
Fanny
, 
because we did develop thispersonal relationship and I™m 
very fortunate in my job 
that I™m able to interact w
ith the survivors and their fami
lies individually, and I meet 
hundreds of them, thousands of
 them for 20 years now, but 
Fanny
 is os Œ really 
special. And again, one of my  profe Œ jobs is
 to ensure that the stories of individuals 
are remembered. And so, while we had grea
t conversations, I didn™t want it to end 
there. I wanted to make sure that other pe
ople were able to hear her story through 
oral histories, read her story. I always ge
t her Œ want her to write out her stories, do 
presentations as much as possible. And so in
 this way, it™s sort of my job, but to 
make sure that her story is heard by as
 many people as possible. She has so ma ny 
things to teach about Œ I 
guess mainly for me is overc
oming. Someone who™s been 
through so mu ch, and by listening to her I un
derstand as mu ch as anybody can, what 
she went through. And knowing her family, 
the main thing is about overcoming that. 
You go thro ugh so many th ings and so metim
es there™s no answer to them, you just 
have to wait things out until th
ey pass. And you™re affected
 for life, but that horrible 
mo ment does pass and you have to 
rebuild your life afterwards. And 
Fa nny
 was 

 
Interv iew with F a
nny  Aizenberg   
April 21, 2011 
 

 
 
15
able to do that. So I knew her story, but 
I also met her daughter and I got to know 
her granddaughter and her great-granddaugh
ter. And so I see that for  the horrible 
things that 
Fanny
 went through, four generations la
ter, there™s a beautiful 12 year 
old girl that™s a friend of my  son™s ac
tually. And I see that if it wasn™t for 
Fanny
 just 
persevering and going on, that™s 
Œ if it wasn™t for that, this
 beautiful 12 year old girl 
would not be there, would not be friends
 with my sons, and 
would not have the 
freedom to go to  school and enjoy life in a way that 
Fa nny
 wasn™t able to later o n  in 
her life. 
Q: Thank you. Thank you ve
ry much. And we™re going to
 continue now with let™s 
say, the usual part of our oral history. Bu t I thought it was very important Œ 
A: I think so . 
Q: Œ that we Œ that we would be able to Œ 

A: Because Œ I™ll you why I feel it™s so important. It™s v ery difficult in this time and 

age, with technology that™s 
so advanced, to such extent
 you have little ones with the 
Œ the computers, the cell phone, just name 
it and it™s growing bigger and bigger, that 
people still could have 
a personal relationship,
 and feel good about 
themself
, that 
they have somebody else who co uld unde
rstand their feelings or what they™re 
saying. Another problem I had 
is because of the things I went thro ugh, I always felt 
Œ and this is still with me today, because itto ok me 50 years to be able to talk about 

 
Interv iew with F a
nny  Aizenberg   
April 21, 2011 
 

 
 
16
it, and I still have a feeling of in feriority, that I™m not like other people, which I™m 
not. 

Q: Because you suffered? Because 
you went through these things? 
A: Yes.  

Q: As if they™re Œ you suffered because of 
something you had done, and that™s Œ that 
suffering made you less of a person rather than  mo re of a person? 

A: Uh-huh. This is because what has been 
done to me. You see, at the museum here, 
I am the only person who went thro ugh 
medical experime ntation. I™m the only 
volunteer survivor who was already married a
nd had a ch ild at the time. So I had the 
responsib ility, which is so difficult to make
 other people unders
tand. This is why 
when I speak to an 
audience here, and wh en you feel the reaction of the people, like 
you did when you heard me 
talk Œ you know so mehow it™
s like a soothing medicine, 
or like somebody pats you on th
e shoulder and said you okay. 
Q: Well, from Œ from what 
Stev e
 said, not only you™re okay
, but you inspired  others 
and were able to form a family
 that now, and that effect of 
Œ of your decisions is felt 
four generations later. 

A: Mm-hm, he™s right, absolutely. It™s true. 
Q: Thank you Œ 
S: You done with me? 

Q: I think we™re Œ I think this pa

 go back to what 
we usually do in  the beginning, and 
that is starting at the beginning.

to come to you.

A: Very good. 
Q: Okay . 
A: I was born in

Q: In the early 20™s,

about the Holocaust. 
So when  we went

go aw ay shortly, and it™s not gonna continue
 to the way. And of course, then the 
Germans st arted to arrest the Jewi sh peop
le, beating them, putting them into jails 
and never knowing what has happened to 
them. And that™s what I feel, it was the 
end of the civilization of 
Germany
. And I tell you why I say that, because in 
Belgium
, if a family had a lot of money, an
d especially having boys, they would 
send them to 
Germany
 to study, because this was th
e ultimate of an education. But 
of course, afterwards we have learned wh at
 those educated people were able to do. 
And we became very friendly w
ith those people and that™s
 how we got involved, and 
we got to know those people who have jo
in ed the underground of
 the solidarity or 
the resistan ce, whatever you called it.

Belgium

free, you don™t have to wo rry, 
we gonna be free. We not goi
ng to be occupied , that™s 
what was used. And of course then  we 
were almost reassured, because of the 
Maginot
 line. And like I say, then everybody
 became a politician, and we believed 
the papers. And we did belie
ve, because we felt reassured with friends, having the 
Maginot
 line, til it became, you know, a sad story, cause they went all around. 
Imagine such a big army , only 18 days they lasted. And 
France
 was occupied.

, 1939, half a year after your dau

Poland
. 
A: Well, this is what started us really being scared.  

Q: Uh-huh. 
A: Because, since we were told that 
Belgium
 and 
Holland
 are gonna remain free, 
the 
Belgium
 govern ment asked people to si Œ young men to sign up. They  didn™t 
know for wh at and fo r where, and many, many have signed up, including my

husband. Also many people who have come from 
Germany
 and 
Austria
 have also 
signed up. And they , in 1940, when the Germ
ans invaded, they all got the call where 
to meet, in
 Dunkirk.  
Q: So your husband signe
d up to be part of th
e Belgian military forces? 
A: Well, we didn't know wh at they™re gonna do. 
Q: Yeah, yeah. 

A: Many for military Œ don™t forget that
 afterwards we have learned that in 
England
 
they had divisions of people 
from different countries in 
Europe
. Some have mi xed

Q: I see. 

A: Because here we were living peacef
ully, and really innocent, completely. 

Innocent is really the word
 you could use, because we
 couldn™t belie

even when the young

they only knew Krista

Q: Let™s go back a little bit, to Ma

A: Yes. 

Q: Œ and we™ve talked about how you got i

 When is the first 
time you saw a German soldier, or yo

A: I have a picture of them. 
Q: You do? Oh my.  
A: Yeah, because once we had the yellow sta

the yellow star in 1940, and the German
s were walking freely in the cafés in 
Belgium
, sure, because they fe
lt they were the Œ the 
heroes, the victors. 
Q: Did you have any experience of Œ of 
a German who would treat you differently 
on the street when they saw yo
u Œ you wearing the yellow star? 
A: No, unless they were in 
charge to check our papers. 
Q: And did you have that happen? 

A: No. 

Q: Your papers weren™t checked. Okay . So  
would it be fair to say that in the first 
year or two you really never had any 
direct contact with the occupiers?

then they  would Œ came smart, and they 
were on both side of the tram, you know, 
the entrance and the exit. 
Q: Right. And you weren™t su
pposed to be on the tram? 
A: Not as Jewish, they would take
 you. They would arrest you. 
Q: So you couldn™t tra Œ 
A: Or when people were stand Œ in 1940, 
we had to buy the yellow star and we had 
to stay in line to get the food rations, b
ecause food was on rations. And of course 
you stayed in line in this small grocery stor
e, wherever th ey had fo od, they had. And 
that™s where they come and examine Jews. 
So you were lucky if you passed, and if 
got a half a bread or something, or certain things, and not being caught. 

Q: Did you have to go to wo
rk again? Once your husband 
left, did you have to  go to  
work ? 

A: To work? No, I didn™t go. I didn't go 
to work any more once I became pregnant.

examine. You had to go every we

Q: Uh-huh. 
A: In those places you have
 physicians or doctors, 
whatever you call it, with 
medications, care and food 
for the child. There was one lady by th e name Madame 
Louise
 who was kind and genero
us and giving me once in awhile food for
 Josiane. 
But it™s so unbelievable today to realize th
at those kind and genero us people were 
risking their own lives, because if they wo
uld be caught, they 
would be shot on th e 
spot, no question ask. They  have a monument in 
Brussels, 
with two people who 
were trying to run aw ay, and 
they were shot by the German
s. It™s hard today to think 
of the courage and the bravery of so
 many kind people. There was no money 
involved, there was no glory 
involved. Here on the fifth floor, if you ever have a 
chance, see that documentary 
of five people. There™s two priests and three women,

England
. My husband happened to be on the one who

England

 tragedy til after the war, because 
the first things the Germans did is t-take
 away the radios. You had to bring the 
radios to a destination, and eve Œ 

Q: Was that for everybody, every citizen, or just the Jews?

problem, and th at was our biggest problem, 
that we were cut off 
completely from the 
rest of the world. Also, bicycles were taken away.

they took the radio away. And just to gi
ve you an idea of the importance of the 
radio, when we got married in 1938, part of
 the family got together, in order to be 
able to buy us a radio. My 
parents didn™t have a radio, because it was too costly. So  
how you explain to young pe
ople today Œ I always mention th at, and once wh en I 
spoke to another place, one of the teachers ha
d slides that in German this Œ they did 
that, take away the radios. But my son-in-law
 Freddie

 Austria

Œ he lived  in an apartment build ing, and he 
said he was not 10, because at 10 he left 
already for 
England

 neighbor, and he got a radio,

Hitler™s

Q: Well, it™s very hard for a

means of communication, not know what th

 How did th ings start to

A: Okay, first of all it started out that 
the Germans in big trucks passed different 
neighborhoods with  loudspeak
er and an nouncing of th e different rules they gonna 
have. And if we are not gonna obey, we 
gonna be punished. The first assignment 
was to take our radios, to bring them to a 
different destination. 
Then also the Je wish 
organizations has had our yello
w stars, which we had to bu
y. We also had to collect 
our fo od stamps, and with those stamps you are allowed to buy wh atever any store 
had av ailable, but you had to
 have the food stamps in 
order to buy. The Germans 
started to Œ and people lined 
up in different little store.
 Don™t forg et there was not 
like a big shopping center or a big food ma

ith the list and you

buy wh atever you need. You coul
d only buy certain thing. And in
 Belgium
 they still 
had small stores, and each stores had differe
nt products to sell.
 So you know one day 
this store is gonna have certa
in thing, and th at this day 
another store is gonna have 
the Œ have thing. And th e Germans started 
to check the people in line, and you never 
know who was gonna be checked, and yo
u never knew wh ich store is gonna be 
checked. So you see, our fear Œ th ere mu st be a better word
 than I use, fear, because 
it was more than just fear. B
ecause you were just looking in
 the side or on the back 
of Œ if somebody is followi
ng you. And another thing wh
at the Germans did already 
in the beginning on, in 
Belgium
 they had street cars. There™s an entrance and an 
exit, so what they were doi
ng, one soldier at the exit, 
one at the entrance, and in 
between time to check people. They started 
to do that at the end of 1940. In the 
beginning people were usi
ng the streetcar and whenev
er you saw somebody coming 
up, you went down  on the other side. But this
 way you had no chance of going there, 
or going there. 
 And after you Œ 
Q: And if they ch eck you and th
ey find you, what happens?

jumping off. Because Œ I don™t know if

Q: Terror, it sounds like. 
A: Œ than fear.

A: Terror is the word, I couldn™t find that 
one. We were really terrorized. And also 
there was a time when we had to put ou r radios to a certain destination. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: And that made it ev en worse, because 
then it cut completely off communication. 

And that™s the only communication we had in 
Belgiu m
 from the outside world, and 
we didn't have the radio. And th
en they confiscated the bicycles.

Belgiu m
 we had an

working with the Nazis and helping the 
Nazis deport the Jews, because many of th

whatever it was, in the house, in their

Q: Did you feel like your faith
 in God had been shaken ?

feeling of such emptiness 
and helplessness, you could 
just cry to God with  many questions and of

we were good people, it™s not

in the attic overnight. And I guess this wa

use either we were

understand when I say that th
is is never going to go out
 of my soul til my dying 
days. The screaming of the baby before it 
was dead, and the mo th

And this was done many times. 
Q: You all Œ when they open 
up the train and you let Œ you™re let out of the train and 
that™s your introduction to 
Auschwit z
. 
A: That™s right. And then we had to form
 li Œ lines, one for men and one for women. 
And in the line where I was 
with the women, my mother  was with me, then he 
separated my  mo ther from me, and I knew be
ing together we go
nna help or being 
able to help one another. But while the 
soldier was ma Œ walking down, I slipped 
over to be with my  mo ther. And I was hit ov
er the head, if I tell you to stay here, 
then that™s what you stay. 
And that was the last time
 I saw my wo
nderful mother 
alive. Then we had to form lines, and fr
om the line I was on, we were taken to a 
freezing room, and we had all to
, in front of soldiers w
ith their dogs, we had to 
undress completely. And I tried to explai
n to you that we a
ll came from decent 
home, and we have never undr
essed in front of strangers
. Not only because we had 
to get undressed, but we were checked if we
 were hiding thing in our private parts. 
After that long wait, we were given unifor
ms and wooden shoes. Then we went and 
we had numbers tattooed on ou
r arm, and we had our head shaved. And finally we 
went to the shower, with 
screams and crying, hold onto one another. And finally,

after the shower, we got one blanket for si

The barracks consisted of shelves covere

people. Besides crying and hugging one an
other, and still not realizing the hell we 
were on, and then we fell asleep. And the 
net Œ and the next day we were called to 
line up, and we lined up, and our group we

where the air was impossible to breathe beca
use of the chemicals. W e were cleaning 
and the fume was bad. We work ed there fo
r 12 hours, then we 
marched back to  our 
barrack where we got soup which was like 
water, and a slice of bread wh ich didn™t 
even taste like bread. And agai
n, we were counted, and at that time, before we were 
allowed to go to  the barracks, we learned 
wh ere our loved ones went and then  we 
saw the crematorium, and the smoke out of that.

inmates who told you? Was it the camp 

guards who told you? 

A: No, we had just above us somebody who 
was in charge of us to make sure we 
behave, and they to ld us. And then  we saw the fumes. 

Q: So th ese were other inmates, too? 

A: Yes, sure. But they Œ they

 is Œ was the Œ the Œ the biggest 
[indecipherable]
 of the Germans, always lining up

working in the ammunition factory who stood

 with holes, and 
we had to  clean those hole, because the next
 department were putting in  small, small 
balls in the holes, so it explodes when they
 needed it. So they
 sabotaged and th ey 
stole those. And you know wh ere they hid it? They  hid it in their mouth. 

Q: Oh my goodness. 
A: And then  one crematorium did explode.
 And it was only for overnight, but at 
least there were a few people less to be ga
ssed at that particular time. But all those 
five women were caught, and they were hang
ed. And the whole camp  had to stay for 
24 hours, til those five
 women died hanging. 
Q: And you had to stand and see this. 
A: Everybody had to  stand a

he want at each time. And on
e of his visits, I was picked
. And I was taken, tied to a 
bed, things were taken fro

Another thing, which I didn™t menti
on befo re, a month after we were in 
Auschwitz
, 
none of th e women had thei
r periods any more, because, can you imagine thousands 
of wo men being there and ha
ving their periods monthly?
 None of us had their 
periods any mo re. But of course, having 
had the medical experimentation, it was 
such a tremendous impact on each and ever
y one. There™s one bo
ok here on the fifth 
floor, wh ich 20 wo men who have surv
ived  medical experimentation in 

Ravensbrück 
have written a book. 
Q: When  this was done,

Q: Were you given an y kind
 of narcotic medication? 
A: You Œ of course not. 

Q: Oh my  gosh. 

A: Of course not. They did that to thou

learned, that the cher Œ Germans made experimentation in 
Auschwitz
 on babies. I 
didn™t know that. You see, he

 a year ago, they had the 

seminar. Physicians or people wh o st

Euro pe
. There were 12 people, and I think 
th ey stayed  here about 10 days. The 
interesting thing is, I coul
dn™t understand til afterwards
 why I was chosen as a 
speaker to those people. 
Only because all those people have studied German 
medicine for the past 200 year
s, and what they were doing 
on us, they started to do 
that 200 years ago. Sterilization, abor
tion. Wh at you call when  men are being 
sterilized, there™s a man in my Œ 
Q: A vasectomy. A vasectomy. 
A: No, there™s another word. It™s gonna come
 afterward. There™s three things that the 
Germans did. Hundreds of years ago, if a family in 
Germ any
 had a child and they 
felt that that child is not perfect, th ey used to have an institution where they gave 

their child away. When 
that child, or adult for that matt
er, died, the family just got a 
notice, your so and so passed away, and th
at was it. Nobody has ever questioned it, 
because everybody had to be perfect in 
Germany
, and if the Œ they were not, they 
were taken to those institutions. And that™s
 why, when they had the seminar here, 
they came to the museum, b
ecause of the background they have already learned, 
what the Germans did, hundreds Œ st
erilization. Couldn™t think of it.  
Q: So, sto Œ

ago, which they trie

A: And they  have books about that, and I 
took a book out becaus
e I wanted to show, 
when they had the seminar. Bu
t they were ahead of me, 
because they are the ones 
who taught me what has happe
ned 200 years ago. So th is
 now is just Œ like they 
have one book wh ich is called ﬁ
The
 
Nazi Doctors
.ﬂ People want to know, why was 
it possible, for educated  people? It™s not 
like today a bunch of hoodlums want your 
money and they kill you just for the m
oney. This was organized by excellent 
physicians, nurses, educated people. How 
co uld they have done the horro rs they 
did? I tell you another thing wh at happened  
Auschwitz
 and what the Germans did. 
They had part of the camp where 
they had Gypsies collected from 
Euro pe
. What 
they have decided and what they  have d
one, there were women, were children and 
men. They decide that the men should lined
 up fo r the following day and that they™re 
gonna be taken to wo rk. Me
anwhile, they have given m
ilk to the children of the 
women who they took the fath
ers away. A few days late
r they took the women and 
the children. That was in A
ugust of 1944. And they ga
ssed the women the following 
two days. In order not to fa Œ have a Œ a 
disturbing, they gave the babies the milk. 
Can you imagine how vicious that is, and 
being done by educated
 doctors who were 
supposed  to help people? 
Q: 
Fanny
, how could you 
stand the pain? 
A: You cannot.  
Q: Did you pass out?

A: Of course, we all did. Ho w could you? 
Q: I can™t imagine. 

A: I can™t even describe it,
 even now. My  whole body is against and hurting. Ho w 
do you describe things like that for people
 who have never seen horrors? We have 
never seen anybody being k
illed except through that pe
riod of time, and except 
seeing those babies being shot coming o
ff the train. How could any normal, if 
there™s a way of calling us normal, to live 
that the rest of your life? You can™t. 
That™s why we have 
Œ I have nightmares. 
Q: Still? 
A: Still today when a train is passing, I ju
st broke out in a sweat, because it still 
beats more. That™s why I say to you, 
and to  everybody who listens, how could 
anybody remain sane, if th
at™s the word I could use,
 after seeing such horrors? 
Q: How did you? 

A: We don™t. We don™t. We don™t. An
d I would never recover. And another thing 
which I say when  I talk to people, it took me
 50 years to be able to just to talk, 

because I still feel I™m le
ss than another person.  
Q: Is that what they gave you, 
th at feeling that you were less Œ 
A: Abso lutely, still to day. I couldn™t talk  about I had medical experimentation, 

because that would make me 
even less than I am already.
 And this was the power of 
the Germans, besides t h e selections. An

the next one, for any reason they  have to 
put the person in the 
crematorium. There™s 
another book here, the author of the book 
passed away a couple years ago. There™s 
only two people, two young men from 
Czechoslovakia
 who escaped 
Auschwitz
. 
They  describe 
Auschwitz
, how the selections was, and they passed Œ the main 
reason for the young men to escape and how they escape, and those were the two 
only ones who ever escape alive, is
 because they wanted  to go to 
Czechoslovakia
, 
where they  come from,  to go to  different organizations, because 
Eichmann
 was 
getting ev erything from the Jewish community in 
Hu ngary. 
Trucks, tools, just name 
it, because he was fooling the Jewish pe
ople, telling them whatever you give us, 
then we would not have th
e discrimination or the deportation of th e Jewish 
[indecipherable]
. But it didn™t happen so, because in spite of everything he took, it 
was continuing. It™s Œ it™s really an amazi
ng book if you could sit through and just 
read it. You have to have a lot of strength,
 or whatever you have in  you. Because I 

was asked by one of the physic
ians who were here at the seminar, asking me how far 
I was in reading the book. And I said so 
far I™m on the second page, and I wasn™t 
able to turn for the third. 
Bu t I have learned from them, which they have studied and 
they would, you know, like see how this is
 continuing with the German people. And 
I wouldn™t be surprised if that™s still con
tinuing today, of the 
experimentation they 
had. They  were number one a

er they put into people.

you were in that place?

I thought that this is it. 

Q: This is it. 

A: And I understand what 
the other women describing

We didn™t know wh at was done.

I thought, I don™t know others, that this is
 gonna be my  last mo ment and I have to 
hang onto it to see my last
 mo ment going out of me. Yo
u see, this is why it™s so 
difficult for me to stan d up and to sp
eak, because everybody had different 
experiences. But here at the museum, of 
having so many survivor volunteers, I™m 
the only one who had the medical experime
ntation. And this 
is why maybe it took 
me so man y  years to be talking about. An
d like I told you, took me 50 years after I 
came back from 
Auschwitz
 from Œ liberated from the Russi
ans. I was in the hospital 
a few times in 
Belgium.
 Don™t forget we didn™t have 
our period a month after we 
got to 
Auschwitz
, and with the experimentation it 
took me 50 years to be able to 
talk about that period. Bu
t you know while they did those experimentation, it was 
like little b y  little your life gets less, and you 
think you th ere already. Then you feel 
another pain, and it™s not there ye
t, you still have to go lower. 
Q: So you feel you™re still a
live because you still can feel 
pain. Not that you can feel 
anything else, but the pain tells you Œ 
A: Well, another thing which was difficult fo
r me to talk about, especially here, 
where you have single people, who fortunat

have a fami ly. And I couldn™

A: Oh yes, I was in the hospital a few times in 
Belgium
, and when  we came to
 
America 
in ™49, I were twice in the hospital. 
Q: And were the doctors then able
 to find out what had happened? 
A: They only knew what 
was happened, and th ey only 
find out when we came to 
America
 in ™49, why I could not conceive. So
 you Œ so  you see, it Œ it™s not like a 
redeeming way of life. Like people were fort
unate to start the life again, married and 
having families. That™s why I 
don™t think it was proper for me to talk here. Cause I 
don™t know if people could put the two and

could somebody else just make peace w

found out, more and more studies are bei
ng done on us, that children of surv ivors 
either went into education, or went
 into medicine. And I tell you why I™m 
mentioning that to you. I think it™s 
very important, because now here in 
America
, 
you hear so much violen
ce, you hear so many you
ng people killing one another. 
Either students, or just in the street the 
gangs. So wh en  they arrest a young person, 
14 - 15, who has been killing, the judge 
or whoever defends 
those people, feel 
because they didn™t have a ve
ry good upbringing, that™s 
what made them violent. 
What about babies born and never know 
the parents, like you see the program a 
couple week s ago, we were still looking fo r 
the pictures of children who have never 
been able to connect to any family, beca
use they were in hiding, or th e parents 
didn™t come back, or any family come ba
ck to claim them. Bu
t all those children 
who have been in hiding, they definitely 
didn™t have a good upbr
inging. And then  in 
spite of that they all in education, or 
in medicine. Like my  daughter, who is in 
education, and my  granddau ghter 
is a medical si Œ psychiatrist. 
Q: An amazing achievement. 
A: But most children of surv
ivors, even born after the 
war, went into education.

Q: What goes Œ 
A: And anyway, 
Auschwitz
 is not describable. There wa
s one famous person that he 
tried to describe 
Auschwitz
, and he said, there™s not en
ough paper, and not en ough 
ink in th e world. But I don™t 
know if I told you before,
 Primo Levi
 was a scientist. 
After the war when he was lib
erated, he went back to 
Italy
 where he was from. He 
got his position back , which was very high 
position. He got married, he had a son, 
and he committed suicide, b
ecause he could not accept th
e outside world. According 
to many statistic, there™s about 
42 people wh o have surv ived 
Auschwitz
 and killed 
themself. I mean prominent people. When
 I say prominent, is people who got 
positions back after the war. They were 
recognized as people 
and they could not 
accept the outside world, after having seen
 what has been done to people. And I 
don™t think that any of us, 
if it wouldn™t be for the seminar, happened here in the 
Holo caust mu seum, I did not know that 
the Germans did medical experimentation 
on babies. But they  knew that.

I™m as normal as I am today. Or just

agony doesn™t go out, never. 
Q: When you were returned to 
Josy

Q: Œ did you feel alone with them? 

A: Yeah, because I Œ I Œ you 
could not have the talk, like 
I have with you today. And 
Œ and don™t forget, this is many years ago. I could not express what I™m expressing 
today. That™s why I said to you, took me 50 years after 
Auschwitz

 daughter went to the different classes 
in order to be able to give the guided t

And I always wonder, does she tell anybody, th

And they  don™t show you th e 
experimentation, they only 
show you th e beatings and 
the work s, you know, done in 
Auschwitz

 why so Œ th at™s why it™s called the dead

And we were really Œ really found out acci

Q: Uh-huh. 
A: This was two months later. The reason 
why we were discovered, it was the last 
battle near the 
Elba
, between the Russians and th e 
Germans. And of course, the 
Russians won at that time. They were 
looking fo r Germans or Nazis who were 
hiding, and many did, beca
use we have witnessed the Russians killing them. 
Because looking for Germans, they found 
us. And they took us in a makeshift 
hospital and they cleaned us up, 
because we all had the typhus. 
Q: You were six women, or 
two Œ or how many were left? 
A: The six of us. 

Q: The same six who were in the barracks?

And they  were very kind. They  gave us Œ fi

they had, it was only milk. And because they
 didn™t have food, that saved our lives, 
because people who have survived, either with the Americans or the British, got the 
rich, canned food. Like I said, I h ad the 
cousin who survived 
and got those canned 
foods. And she surviv

We got recommendations from the Russian

gift you™re giving not just to
 me right now in this room, 
but a gift you™re going to be giving to 
all the people who will be watching this. 
A: Well, especially here in 
the museum, I™m the only one. 
Q: Yeah, yeah. 
A: They don™t have another surv ivor 
who had been  married. They  don™t have 

another survivor who has a child. And I™m so
 proud that my  daughter and son-in-law 
have joined it. 
Steve
 would tell you. And I™ll tell you w
hy, because when I started to 
come here and feel comfortable in our little
 corner Œ I have no
thing to do with the 
rest of people in the museum, forgive me.  

Q: It™s okay. 
A: I™m very close to 
Michelin
(ph). 
Q: I could see that. 
A: She™s about my daughter™s age. 

Q: Mm-hm. 
A: But it™s wonderful, our relationship. 
You have no idea how mu ch I appreciate 
that. She could call me any time, and there™s 
always something that we have to offer 
one another. 

Q: That™s wonderful. 
A: As far as we Œ oh, priceless, you could say. 

Q: Yeah, yeah.

A: Okay . And I was with
 Steven
, how could we have any 
relationship? I had Œ are 
we still on? 
Q: Yeah, we™re still on. If you want to turn  
off, we can turn off. 
We™re still rolling, 
though, we™re still rolling. Because you kno
w, when we™re doing that, because some 
of wh at you say relates to what you were te
lling me about. And if you want it turned 
off we can do so , because I think we™re over 
the most Œ you know, 
the formal part of 
our relationship, but we™re also 
talking about how it comes th Œ 
A: Life. 

Q: Life. How it is that you bu
ild trust again. This is one
 of the things you know s Œ 
I™m happy I™m in my seat rather than in
 yours, because I don™t know if I could 
answer the questions. I don™t know if I coul
d articulate. But I think that one of the 
challenges, if I can even star
t to imagine my self in having gone thro ugh wh at you™ve 
gone thro ugh, in th is kind of betrayal of 
human spirits, the betrayal of human beings 
by other human beings, is
 how do you learn to trust others again? 
A: That™s very difficult, that™s 
why I don™t trust just everybody. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: In spite of me needing people, as you could tell. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: And wanting to 
be with people.

Q: Yeah, of course, of course. You know, it™s not a distrustful nature, it™s 
experience, it™s what life showed  you.
 It™s what you™ve gone thro ugh. 
A: But then again, look how many wonderfu
l, wonderful Œ you kn
ow, when you just 
think in your mind Œ 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ complete, complete strangers have no
th ing to  benefit by it, except risking their 
lives. And they were not all 
religious people. The major
ity started from church es 
and convents, because we need
ed that Œ I mean, 
they needed that 
outlet. But can you 
imagine in society today that people would 
want to risk their life to  save somebody 
else™s child, at su
ch a high cost? 
Q: Yeah, yeah. 

A: Not only for themselves, but the whole co
nvent for that matter,
 which theywere 
responsib le. And there™s so many horro r book
s about young people
, what they  went 
through in hiding in  conven ts. But then ag
ain you hear wonderful stories. But can 
you imagine today people taking a child 
and being responsible for the child, and 
risking their own life in order to save anot
her human being, fo r no reason at all? No 
money, no glory. You mu st s
ee that documentary they have
 here. It just makes you Œ 
you know, you read someth
ing of the book and th

Q: Yeah.

Q: Mm-hm.

hear that book? 
Q: No, I haven™t. 
A: It™s written by 
Ma ndy Mandel

A: She™s a daughter of survivors. Her fath

untries. I happen to  know two, one is 

my doctor™s wife. Her name Œ I forgot her first name, 
Loeffler
? I don™t know if you 
ever heard that name. But 
Mindy Mandel
(ph) has made quite a reputation for 
herself as a painter, as a speaker. 

Q: Well, you know, here™s another though
t that comes to  my mind as we™ve been 
speaking. I remember Œ

a clean handkerchief? 
Q: I do. 
A: Or a clean tissue? 
[indeciphera ble]

Q: And so epcet Œ exceptional about you.
 And I will tell it by way of a little story. 
Thirty years ago I remember, I was a memb
er of Amnesty International, okay . And 
Amnesty International was having campaigns
 against torture. And there were some 
people that came to their attention. And at
 that time there was the aftermath of the 
Camb odian genocide. And there was a youn
g man they featured in one of their 
stories, and what he said always struck
 me, because he was somebody who su rviv ed 
the Camb odian genocide. He saw his parent
s mu rdered, he saw his Œ his siblings 
murdered, and he surv
ived. And he said, I survived 
not only because I ca Œ I am 
living and breathing, I survived  because I ca
n love again, after having gone through 
that. And that is an achiev
ement, because so many people 
couldn™t, after they have

been exposed to this kind of
 brutality, this kind of 
hatred, they couldn™t. And 
everything I hear from you a
bout your children, about 
Josy
, about your 
grandchildren, about the people that you ev er
 Œ it has that spirit of love to it. And 
that™s why I can™t Œ I can™t 
imagine that you would be anything other than mo re 
than, rather than wh at you said earlier about
 feeling inferior. If you can love ag ain, 
that™s a lesson fo r all of us, you know, 
because whatever cha
llenges you go th rou Œ 
and ev erybody has challenges, just some of 
us are not in those kinds of challenges. 
A: Of course. The daily life you have challenges, sure. 

Q: We are always challenged on do I trust again Œ 

A: Yeah. 
Q: Œ do I love again? Do I 
put myself out there again? 
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: Do I make my self vulnerable to  other 
people again? And it takes extraordin ary 
courag e to do it in the face of past experiences. 
A: Right. 
Q: And Œ I mean, I don™t have an
y other word s, those are just Œ 

A: Yeah.
