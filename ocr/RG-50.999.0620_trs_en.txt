Marcel, thank you som uchfor joining us and being wi lling to be our 
F i rs t  P e rs o n
 
today. W e 
have just an hour,a short time, and youhaveso much to share with us so we will start ri ght 
away if  that'sok.
 
Sure.
 
Bef ore we turn to thewar years with Germ any's invasion of Poland in Septem ber
 
1939, 
followed by their attack on France in May
 
1940, let's startf irst with you telling us a littlebit, 
what you can,about your parentsand their life before the war began.
 
W ell ,  m y f at he r
 
was apresser. Hepressed wom en's clothing. Andm y m other was a 
seam stress. Shehad to take lessons to com e to the UnitedStates, to be able to com ehere.
 
You shared with m ethat yourf ather,although he wasn't educated in aformal sense, hadan 

incrediblenum berof  languages that he k
n e w.
 
He spoke several languages. Hepickedthem upas he went through lif e. He learnedT urkish, 

Russian, several Slovakian languages.
 
And picked up French when he m oved to France.
 
I hope so.
 
Marcel, both of your parents were born in Rom ania and then lef tf
or Constantinople, Turkey. 
W hydid they leave Rom ania andm ove toT urkey? 
 

W ell, m y m other had been born 
and they had a big pogrom there and they decided that it 

would be better,f or safety purposes, to leavethat country.
 
And a p
ogrom  was attacks on Jewish people, assaults on them.
 
Oh, yeah. They were killing them .
 
So they m oved toT urkey.W hyT urkey? Do you know? 
 

Because they were being acceptedby theT urkish whereas any other country wouldn't have 

accepted them .
 
Your m other, I believe, had 15 siblings.
 
Ye s .
 
How lar ge was your extendedfam ily between your m other and yourfather? 
 
Shehad 15 brothers and sistersbutnot many of  them  survived becauseof  the 
p
ogrom  and all 
of  the problem s. Life was not that great in those days.
 
And speaking of  that, your parentsm et inT urkey. T hey married.T hen they moved to Paris. 

W hydid they go to Paris?
 

T hat's a good question. My f ather'sf am ily m oved to the states. My m other'sf am ily m oved to 

France.W henm y father m arried m y m other,he decided thathe would joinher fam ily rather 

than go with the other fam ily.
 
T ell us a little bitaboutyour siblings. You wer e thef ourth. You cam e a little later.
 
I'm  the accident.
 
 
[Laughter] 
 
So tellus about your siblings.
 
W hat wo u l d
 
yo u
 
like to know?
 
Your oldest was your sister. Rig
ht? 
 
My eldest was born inConstantinople.She went to France with m y parents and becam e 

educated in France. It was highl y educated at thetim ef oraf em ale to get educated like that.
 
And then your two brothers were born, like you were, in Paris.Anda lit
t le  b it  lat e r t ha t  will 
becom e signif icant and we'll talk about that.
 
 
Do you know when they m oved to Paris af ter leaving Constantinople, Turkey, what 
was lif e likef orthem  in thepre
-
war years in Paris? 
 

 
2
 
W ell, it was comf ortable. My f ather lookedf ora place to makem oney, on the jobas a presser, 
or learned how to beapresser. Andhem aintained that jobf oralm ost all of his lif e.I never 

thought presser was acareer.
 
But it's whathedid, including later, com ing tothe UnitedStates.Buttheir life was
 
reasonably 
comfortable and safe?
 
Very comf ortable. My m other usedto sewf or the wholeneighborhood. She was a very go od 

se a m st re ss.  

So they lived a reasonably comf ortable life.Then in May of  1940 Germ any invades France. 

Paris becomes an occupied country
. A n d
 
--
 
city. And your parents would rem ain in Paris until 
1942.
 
W e did.
 
T ell us what life was like, to the best of your knowledge, during that two
-
year period of livin g 
there under the direct occupation of the Germ ans in Paris.
 
From  1940 to1942 there was nothing stopping us f rom  continuing our lif e. After 1942 it 

becam ea different story.
 
Bef ore we turn to 1942, when the Germ ansf irst attacked Paris, there was, of course, 

bombardm entsof  Paris. There'sa coupleof  incidents that you know about.
 
Ye s. I wa
s told, later in lif e, that as m y mother was running towards the shelters,f rom the 
bombardm ent,m y blanket was hit by shrapnel and it burnt a hole inm y blanket. And whenm y 

m other got into the subway station, shefoundtheburntblanket. Maybe I livedfor a reason.
 
So they obviously wer e having to seek shelter during thebom bardment.
 
W e were always scared. Every tim e the sirenwent off , we were able
 
--
 
the curtains would get 
shut.W e would sit down and eat in the dark.Somehow m y f ather alwa ys saw in the 
d a rk. If  I 

went for thef ood
 
--
 
In the dark.
 
In the dark,m y f atherwould hit me with thefork.
 
 
[Laughter] 
 
In the dark.
 
In the dark. But he hit me all the time.
 
Your parents and yoursiblings had their French citizenship takenawa y from them.
 
T hey sure d
id .
 
But that didn't happento you. Explain that sowe can understand that.T hey lost their 

citizenship but you did not.
 
Because I was born inFrance. Andm y brothers were born in France. So we didnot loseour 

citizenship.W e were citizens andm aintainedthe French citizenship.
 
But your mother,father, and sister
 
--
 
Lost their citizenship.
 
W hat was the rationale for that?
 
W ell, if  you'renaturalized, in other words, if you cam e in after 1940 to France, you becam e 

subjecttobecom e aforeign Jew and that way
 
you becam e susceptible to be picked up by the 
Germ ans.
 
And the languageof
 
th a t
 
day, considered today, considered stateless. You had no home 
country at thatpoint.
 
T hat's right. And in 1942 they pickedup theJews.
 
So tellus about the sum mer of 1942.That'swhen your f am ily le
f
t f o r  
F
ree France, Vichy 
France.
 

 
3
 
Yes. Actually we lef t June
 
16.W e arrived inSouthern France,the last stop bef ore we got into 
F
ree France. Free is called
 
--
 
Explain thatf orus. Explain whatf ree Francereally m eant.
 
It really m eant that theGerm ans were not there yet.T hey got there in 1943 or late1942.
 
T he governm ent controlling 
F
ree France was
 
--
 
Very m uch French.
 
Collaborationists with the Nazis.
 
Ye s .
 
Do you know wh y your fam ily chose to gothe direction it went?
 
W ell, they couldn't get out.They couldn't getpassports to get outf rom France because they 
were f oreign Jews. Soyou couldn't get pass passportsanym ore. And, of course, Am erica 

didn'taccept people yetfrom France.
 
You toldm e that whenthedeportations began in Paris, when Jews, particularly as you 

described those that lost their citizenship, wer e deported, that there were Parisians who 

denounced Jews to get their apartm ents.
 
T ha t's righ t. On top  of th a t
 
--
 
well, it just happens that this was the 71st anniversary of
 
t he  
roundup.It came up on July
 
17, two days ago. At that time 
--
 
I gota paper. I gotto read it 
becausem y girlf riend is very strict.
 
[Laughter] 
 
I hope If ind it. Here it is. 
 

T his is the roundup at the Velodrom e?
 
Yes. My f ather had the foresight to listento rum ors and we lef t Parison June
 
16, 1942. Exactly 
onem onth before the roundupof foreign Jews by the French police.W e boarded trains,as we 

did in1940.T histim e the authorities ref usedto allow Jews to return to Paris. Our identif ication 

cards
 
had a J on them, m arking us as Jews. W e went to Bride
-
le s
-
Bains, which was in Vichy, 
France. Bride
-
le s
-
Bains becam e popular in 1992for the Olym pic Gam es. It was usedas the 
living quarters f or the participantsof  the gam es.
 
On July
 
16 and 17 of  1942
 
--
 
A  
month after you lef t.
 
Yes, sir. T housandsofFrench police swooped down on Paris neighborhoods to arrest 13,152 

im m igrantsandf oreign Jews f rom  EasternEurope at the behest of the occupying Germ an 

authorities as well as the orders of [Speaking Non
-
E n glis
h Language]. Childless couples and 
unmarried adults were taken toexisting internm ent cam ps in France. Butothers included1,129 

m en, 2,916 wom en, and 4,115 children were takento ill
-
equipped stadium s known as 
Velodrom e, an indoorstadium  where they held indoor bicycle racing events. T hey were held 

therefor betweenf our and six days with no water, nofood, and thetoilets were starting to 

overf low. Af ter the roundup, nearly all 13,152 people arrestedon July
 
16 and 17, had been 
handedover to the Germ ansand shipped to Auschwitz. Only 100 survi ved at the endof the 

wa r .
 
W hen the rounduphappened on thatday, asyou described those couple of days, you had by 

then
 
--
 
I  m is s ed  it .
 
You m issed it. So youended up inthis littletown of  Bride
-
le s
-
Bains.
 
Ye s .
 
T el
l us why Bride
-
le s
-
B ains, if  you know
 
--
 
I think your fam ily had vacationed there. Right? At 
one point? 
 

 
4
 
I thinkthey had been there. I really don't remem ber. All I know is that when we got off on the 
train station, wem etall thefam ily at the station.W e
 
were all in the sam e car.
 
My si gnif icantother has a theory on that in saying that they probably planned it that way so 

thatthe children wouldn't denounce each other, which is probably true. 
 
So how m any of  you ended up in thatplace bef ore you went to B
r i de
-
le s
-
Bains? 
 
I would thinkthat there were thef our sisters that we saw in the introduct
i on .
 
Your m other's sisters?
 
Ye s .
 
And their fam ilies.
 
And theirfam ily. One
 
--
 
you'll ask m e that later.
 
A
ll righ t .
 
So now you're  in Bride
-
le s
-
Bains. A little town.
 
A  lit t le  no t h in g.
 
W ere youhiding there?
 

W e were hiding intheopen, I guess. My f ather m ade sure that wewent to church on Sunday. I 

went to church regularly. I alwa ys wore m y beret. And I sat in the pews. And the priest would 

co m e, ta ke  offm y b e ret, p ut
 
it onm y lap. Ididn't know anything about that. Didn't pay attention 
to it.But later in years when I went to Canada and metm y brother, he told me that that priest 

was reall y a Jew and he knew who we were, so he made sure thatm y hat was off so thatI 

w
ould be taken
 
--
 
Inf act, thatpriest was a member,as I recall,of  the underground, the resistance.
 
 
W hen youm oved to Bride
-
le s
-
Bains, obviously there's a fam ily to support and f eed. 
How did your parents
 
--
 
how did theyf eed the fam ily?
 
My f ather became 
a lum berjack. All his fingers looked like they were  crushed by the lum
b
e r 
th a t c
ame through hishand. You know when you stub your toe or you stub yourf ingers, your 
nails grow f unny. W ell, m y father never needed a manicure.
 
You had told me
 
--
 
And m y m other
 
was a seam stress.
 
So she started sewing.
 
She m ade m oney.
 
And yourfather, as you saidtom e, was not cut out to be a lumberjack.
 
No, he was not. He was protected
 
--
 
Management protected him.
 
Ye s,  sir.
 
And yourm other as
 
--
 
was a seam stress so you were abl
e to m ake ends m eet there.
 
 
You were going to church, as you said. Did 
you 
pretend as afam ily that you were 
Ca t h o lic ?
 
W ell, I was the only one that went to church.
 
Ok. So here you are in a little town. There'sa fair num ber of  you. People knew you were 

ou
tsiders. Did they ask questions? Did they probe? Did they want toknow
 
--
 
T hey didn't want to know that muchbecause I spoke perf ect French. I guess I went to school 

bef ore I went to Bride
-
le s
-
Bains.Things were normal life bef ore theGerm ans cam e in.
 
Did  
you go to school in Bride
-
le s
-
Bains? 
 
I mu st ha ve . My
 
m other used to
 
--
 
s le e
ve
 
protectors.W eused to use real ink in school and 
they leaked a lot and wenton shirts. 
 
T ha t  yo u  r em em be r .
 
 
You shared with m e
 
--
 
these were your words
 
--
 
that Bride
-
le s
-
Bains 
was a hotbedof  

 
5
 
the French resistance.Tell us about them .
 
T hey used to com e inonce a m onthor so.They usedto getdropsfrom  the French resistance 
in England, used to send planes, would dropfood stuff. My brotherusedto come home wi th 

cans of beans or
 
whatever that he would bring hom e tom y parents.It was a bigf
iesta. W hen 
they came into town, they usedtom archdown the road. My brother let me carry his rif le.I 

usedtodrag it because it was bigger thanme. Everything was bigger than me.
 
W hich brot
her was this?
 
Jean.
 
Andhe was am em ber of  the resistance him self.
 
He sure was. He was a hero.
 
Absolutely.
 
 
You toldm e that you don't rem em ber the Germ ans com ing in anddoing raids in 
B ri d e
-
le s
-
Bains.W hy do you think they didn't?
 
Because they were scared.Becausethey cam e into town, they would have got hurt.T he 

underground would have taken care of it.
 
W hydo you think they didn't try to crush the resistance there? 
 
W ell, it was very m ountainous.W e were right near thealps.The French were in the 

m ounta
in s .
 
Kind of guerrilla warf are.
 
O
h, yeah. And there was not aplace that people thatdidn'tbelong there wanted to go.
 
Of course, youm entionedto m ethat there were people who did spy f or the Germans.W hy do 

you think you were not denounced? Here's this f
a m ily of  J e ws  livin g in  t h is  lit t le t o wn .
 
W ell, we didn't really botheranybody. Im ean, the French got tobe sympathizers to what was 

going on.T he Frenchdown in the little towns were not asprejudiceas the French in thebig 

towns. T he French in the big
 
towns were anti
-
S e m it ic .
 
And for the folks there
 
--
 
A n d  s t ill a re.
 
Andfor thefolks in Bride
-
le s
-
Bains, the enem y f orthem  was the Germ ans.
 
Ye s .
 
So that's why it was a hotbedof  resistance there.
 
 
Do you know if  your brother, Jean, did 
he  e ver  
f ire his  r
if le?  
 
W ell, they tried to do that. My brother
-
in
-
law stopped them . My brother was in the same troops. 
T here were Germansplaying in the snow. Because the snow is near theAlps a lot. And they 

were playing on a swin g. M y brother stood up and wantedto shoot one of them, andmy 

brother
-
in
-
law says sit down, don'tm ove, I'll break your head.And he saved his lif e because 
he would have shot, probably would have m issed them .
 
Despite thefactthat the Germ ans were not com ing in theremuchbecause of the resistan
ce ,  
you have m em ories, though, of som epretty scary incidents.
 
W ell, yes. One of them was there was six truc ks that parked right under
 
the balcony that we 
saw on the slide, six big trucks, all Germans.And they parked rightunder us. I was playing on 

the b
alcony with a French f riend. He saw usand we decided to go inside thehouse.Andwhen 

we got inside the house, there was a big knock on thedoor.W e knew there was a Germ an 

cam e up to seeus.And this German knocked on the door. My f riend and Ididn't wan
t to open 

it buthe started banging louder and louder. I said you betteropen up
, 
this guy's going to break 
thedoor.Som y f riend openedthe door, andI swear this German was as big as the 

doorjam bs. Hef it in the door. Heprobably had to walk sideways to
 
com e in.
 
But whenhe cam e 

 
6
 
in, he says
 
[Speaking Non
-
English Language]. I understand Yiddish but m y f rienddidn't 
understand Germ an. Yiddish is sim ilar to Germ an.
 
 
At any rate, after a while he kept on saying [Speaking Non
-
English Language] and 
got onm y nerves andI said
 
--
 
I'm a little guy, andI say he wantsa glass of  water.And m y 
f riend got the glassofwater. He gi ves it to him . Andthen he says [Speaking Non
-
E n glis h  
Language], which m eans you're a Jew. And Isaid, no. Andm yf riend said,no,no, no,
 
he's not 
Jewish. And then he lef t the house. Sweat pouring down m y head. Iknew f orone reason or 
another thatI was not supposedtobe speaking to the Germ ans inthef irst place.And when he 

saw that I understood Yiddish
 
--
 
or Germ an,he knew I was Jewis
h. And he didn't pick m e up.
 
 
T hose same trucks happened to have been the one that picked up m y aunt and 
uncle.And they never cam e back.
 
F ro m  B ri de
-
le s
-
Bains?
 
F ro m  B ri de
-
le s
-
Bains.T hey went to Auschwitz. I got papers in themuseum  that said that they 
d is
appeared in Auschwit z.
 
Y
ou shared with m ethat the locals, particularly the resistance, people in the resistance, really 
dealtharshly with those in the town that they thought were collaborators.
 
T hat was at theend ofthe war.
 
Ok. Maybe we'll com eback to
 
tha ta  little  later.
 
 
Your sister endedupm arrying a f ellow
 
--
 
T he guy that saved m y brother.
 
W hen your sisterm arried him , your parents were not happy about it.
 
Of course not. He wasnot Jewish. And that was againstthe rules. But unf ortunately during t
he 
war m y m otherfelt that it probably was best that she stayedm arried to him.
 
And itturnedouthe was also in the resistance, right?
 
Yes. He's the one that saved m y brother.
 
Ok. Maybe we can com eback to that later.
 
 
So you stayed in Bride
-
le s
-
Bains f rom  1942, June
 
1942, to August
 
1944. And that's 
when your f am ily m oved back toParis.W hatm ade itpossiblef or you to go back to Paris and 

what was it like to beback in Paris? 
 
W ell, the Germans were leaving. T hey were r etreating back to Germany. It was al
m ost the end 
of  the war andthe Battle of  theBulge hadpassed over, and they wer e losing quite abit of 

people.T he Stalingrad also dissem inated theGerm ans andthey decided they were going to 

m ake the last stand in Germ any. So we had an opening to go back.Andm y brother being in 

the resistance went back to do hisf ighting inParis, but he didn't dom uchf ighting because it 

was over.
 
T
he
 
resistanceplayeda pretty signif icant role in the liberationof  Paris. Didn't they?
 
Yes. T hey chased therest of them  that were in the Parisarea.There's a lot of  bulletholes in 

buildings in Paris itself f
rom  the uprising.
 
Once Paris was liberated, is that when your parentsfelt you could go back toParis?
 
Yes, sir. And that's when I saw the biggest parade inm y lif e.On the shouldersof m y f ather.
 
T ell us about that.This was a prof ound momentf or you.
 
W ell, they closedoff the Cham psElysees. If  you've ever been toParis, that's the biggest Main 

Street in the world that I know of .They have42 soldiers lined up, com ing
 
down the Cham ps 
Elysees. I was standing on myf ather's shoulder watching theparade.
 
And you said earlier today, you said that remains so vivid in your m em ory.
 
You go to Paris onthe25th of August, whichhappenstobem y birthday, I'm driving m y car  

 
7
 
t h ro
ugh Paris and I see all of thesef lags. I said, 
ﬁH
ow did they know I was com ing?
ﬂ 
 
[Laughter] 
 
It happened to be a celebrationf orthe liberation of Paris.
 
W ere youableto goback to yourform erhom e, where you actually lived?
 
I sure was. Actually, one of
 
m y nephews li ved there with his wif e. He got divorced buthiswif e 
s t ill li ve s  t h e re .
 
T o t h i s  da y?
 
Yeah.
 
Althoughfor you and yourfam ily, for Paris and the French, the war eff ectively ended in 

August
 
1944 but the war continued elsewhere until the surrender inMay.W hat was your 
fam ily's lif e likeduringthatperiod? You'reback in Paris.
 
W ell, we were all
 
--
 
well, food was ver y scarce. My f ather wrote tohis sister in Brooklyn and he 
told her about the hardships thathe was going through and she said, 
ﬁW h
y don't yo
u com e 
over here, to the States?ﬂ
 
And m yf ather said "T hat sounds like aplan." 
 
 
But he tried to get in there but he couldn't com ebecausehe was born in Romania. 
And the French quotawas wide open because no French people were leaving to go to 
the 

United States. But weas French citizens got visas to come to the states right away.
 
Bef ore we talk about you com ing to the states, talk about thatperiod before the war ended. 

You toldm e a
 
--
 
really a truly f unny story, I have to adm it,about youwould get food packages 
and you got a package of  what you thought was soup.
 
Oh, yeah. My sister wa s taking English lessons in school. She tooka packageand said s
-o -a -
p 
on there.And m y mother asked m y sister what does thatm ean.Andm y sister read itand sa
id  

that m eans soup.
 
[Laughter]
 
Andm y m other went out andboughtthis beautif ul chicken on theblack market.She put it in 

thepot, put the vegetables in thepot, and poured thepackage in, what she thought was soup, 

andput it on the stove and started boiling and all of a sudden suds cam e out of it.
 
 
[Laughter] 
 
T hey got in panic andsaw all of the suds.W hathappened isthe soup was soap.W e hadthe 

cleanest chicken but
 
--
 
 
[Laughter] 
 
T he worst soup therewas.
 
Did you start school atthatpoint? 
 
T o lear
n  
En
gl
ish? No.
 
No, period. T o learn math.
 
Ye s .
 
Andas you said, your parents began trying to f igureouthow they can em igrate and leave 

France.
 
Ye s .
 
And the Romanian quota was a very sm all quota. Right?
 
T
hat's correct.T hat was Eastern Europe. And Eastern Europe, eventhe UnitedStates was, if  
you wi ll, anti
s
em itic sothatm y parents couldn't come with us. But when we became citizens, 
m y brother,Achilles, got drafted as soon aswe got to New York. Actually a year af ter we got to 

New York. He got draf ted into the Arm y. He didn't becom e a citizen. I became the citizen. But 

we brought m y parents over. Af terf ive years they were able to come over.
 
T hey hadbeenm aking efforts since theend of the war to try to get here.
 

 
8
 
Yes. My m other learned to become literate. My f ather already knew how to write and allof  that 
stuff .
 
You recently reada book written in French by your cousin, Rachel.You learned a lot of details 

you didn't know.
 
W ell, I really f orgota lot of  whathappened inBride
-
le s
-
Bains.If orgot a lot of
 
m y history until I 
read her
 
--
 
sheand her sister escaped duringthe war. She was work ing. And theGermans 
pickedup her parents
 
--
 
You toldus about them  a little while ago.
 
Yeah.T hey went out
 
--
 
they sent out the youngest daughter tof indthe sister. A
nd her 
em ployer, who happened to be in theunderground, wouldn't let her leave and says you're not 

going back to your parentsbecausethey're not com ing back anyway. You
 
are staying right  
where you are. And that's how we saved them  by not letting them  go back totheir parents.
 
And you learnedm any other details about that tim ef rom  Rachel's book.
 
Yeah. And she went to a 
nu
nnery actually and was raised ina nunnery.
 
As you toldus af ew mom entsago, your parents couldn't com e till later but you and your sist
e r 
was m arried, so she was in France.
 
Yes. Shedidn't com e.
 
So you and your two brothers com e tothe United States in 1946.T ell us about com ing to the 

United States. You're 9 years old, I believe.
 
Yeah. W ell, f irst thing
 
--
 
m y cousins andf riends
 
--
 
I 'm  a
noddity. Here I com efrom  a foreign

I want toask you about something when you were on the ship. Youwere a little boy. You had 

s o m e 
lead soldiers.
 
I was playing on the ship, playing with m y le
a

m oney. I'm  playing
 
wit h them and som e young kids cam e over and tookm y soldiers and threw 
them  overboard.T hatwas a sad tim e.

Yiddish.
 
So it was toughfor her. How about your father?
