today.
 
>> A
lex Shilo:  You'rewelcom e.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You have so much to sharewith us. W eshould probably start right awa y.  
Andhopef ully we'll have timef or questionsf rom  our audience.
 
 
Bef ore we turn to your lif e during the Holocaust and during the 
war years
, let's start,f irst, with you telling us what you can about yourf am ily, your parentsand 
you in that time bef orewar began in 1939. 
 
>> A le x S h ilo
:  First of all, m y parents and the whole extendedf am ily, we cam ef rom an area 
which was then in Poland called Galicia.  Galicia today is in the Ukraine.  They lived in a small 

town.  And in thattown there were about 9,000 people living there,a 
populati
on of 9,000.  1/3 
were Pols, 1/3 were Ukrainians,and 1/3 were Jews.
  
Most of m y relatives left that town 
between the wars.  And Im ust say, generally speaking, whoever lef t thetown survi ved.  
W hoever stayed perished
, i
ncluding m y grandparents. 
 
 
So they came mostly to France.  And since thenthef am ily has 
developed and extended, producedm any doctors, lawyers, engineers, university prof essors, 
e tc., e tc.  On e 
agronom ist
, th a t's m e.
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us about yourf ather in his day.
 
>> A le x S h ilo :   My
 
f ather was thef ourthof a series of f ive brothers.T he lastbrother stayed in 
Poland andperished. Incidentally, af ter the war
 b
ut still perished. 
 
 
My f ather was

the norm al track wasf or these new imm igrants

to another open air market.  My f ather was a traveling salesm an.
 
 
First we li ved in Strasbourg.  And then in 1938, whenm y f ather 
wanted to move to Paris, which is m ore central and was more helpful in orderto travel in1938, 
but in 1940, the Germ ans invaded Franceand we were com pelledtoleave Paris and to go to 
the so

>> Bill Benson:  Can you tell us what lif e was like in Paris inthat year before the war began?
 
>> A l
ex Shilo:  I think we had a good lif e.  Itwas a good housing project. In these days they 
already had an elevator.  They already had ashower in thehouse which,for France, I won't 
call it a novelty, but alm ost.  Ithink we had a good lif e.  But then war
 
cam e and we had to 
leave.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And,of
 
course, war cam e in1939 when Germ any 
invaded Poland, but the f ull 
e f f e c t.
 
>> Alex Shilo:  The line to protect chance, which was
 
--
 
the Germ an tricked the French. T hey 
invaded through Belgium . W ithin three weeks they were in France.T hey were alm ost inParis 

within three weeks.  And,of course,m any people in Paris, including m y family, we ran away.  I 
rem em ber, I think we took a taxi f rom Paris, about 60
 
m ilesto reachoneof  the last trains

leaving f o
r  t he  s ou t h.  
 
>> Bill Benson: W henthey invaded France and then cam e to Paris, you were about 6or 7 
alm ost. 
 
>> Alex Shilo:  1933, yeah.  Something like that.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Do you remember that yourself?
 
>> Alex Shilo:  Very va guely.  Very vaguel y.  We wentf irstto a small town, Issoudun, where 

m y f atherhad som emanufacturers.  And then we m ovedfurther south wheremy mother had 
an uncle living therefor decades. 
 
>> Bill Benson: W henyou were in Issoudunfor a short period of time, I think you went
 
to  
school.
 
>> Alex Shilo:  I went to a school, pre
-
K . It wa s p re
-
K.W e were threefam ilies together. W ith 
four children in the sam e schooland everybody was telling hom ewhat badthings the other kid 
did.  Quiteusual.
 
 
But then two fam ilies m oved. The First Family m oved back to 
T unisia.  Yes. One ofm y m other's sistersmoved with her husband.  Her husband was a 
surgeon.  He's a doctor.  He moved to Tunisia with his daughters.
 
>> Bill Benson: W ere they able to stay in T unisia throughout the war?
 

>> A
lex Shilo:  They stayed inTunisia throughout the war.  I know m y uncle was in a lot of  
trouble.  First of all, knowing Germ an, he was the kindof  representative of the Jewish 

comm unity
 w
ith theauthorities. And the authorities, the Germ an kept askingfor
 
money and 
m oney
 
andm ore money.  Andf rom  whatI heard,he was in really big troubleat the very end.

Ultim ately they were liberated by the British som ewhere in 1943. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  So yourfam ily m oves f rom  Issoudunfurther south into Vichy, France
, 
to  
Villef ranche. W hydid they go to Villef rancheand would stay therefor the remainder of  the 
war?  T ell usabout your life in Villef ranche and why they went there.
 
>> Alex Shilo: W e went there becauseanuncle of m y m other livedtherefor decades.  He 
had 
a special story.  He left the little village in
 
V ille f ran c h e
 
f or France beforeW orld W ar I. And 
when the war started
 
--
 
and thenhe was anAustrian national. W hen the war started,hefound 
him self as a young boy
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  By him self ?
 
>> A l e
x Shilo:  By himself.  He foundhim self an enem y national inenem y territory.  See, he 
was assigned to live in a town near.  He methis wif e.  He got married
 a
nd then went just 
nearby. T his is why we cam e there.  He was establishedtheref ordecades. 
 
>> 
Bill Benson:  So you had som e sem blance of fam ily there.
 
>> Alex Shilo:  Yeah. T hey were just li ving next door to us.
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us a littlebit about whatVichy, France, was.  You hadescapedParis 

which was occupied by the Germans, crossed intoanotherpart of France, Vichy, France. T ell 
us what thatm eant.
 
>> Alex Shilo:  Vichy, France. W edidn'tf eel it because we were so lucky to be in a sm all 

town. W e werem aybe 15 Jewish f am ilies. Ever ybody knew we wer e Jewish.  But they we re 
not host
ile.  Now, Vichy, France, had rules, had laws.  My f ather had totravel with a stamp 
" Jew"  onhis ID,on his ID card. And I realized only m uch laterthat whenmy father took his 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

train to visit his clientson Monday m orning, there was no guaranteewe would
 
see him  on 
Friday 
or Saturday. T here was no guarantee.
 
 
Now, we were luck y enough because we areFrench. But inm y 
class, I think in1941 or 1942, there were two kids, afam ily of  Polish
-
Jewish im m igrants
 
--
 
or  
refugees. I wouldn't call them  im m igrants, refugees. And two were in m y class.  Andoneday 
they vanished. They had been taken to be relocated. That's what we learned.
 
 
T he irony is that when that fam ily was relocated, thef
ather 
s a id
 
--
 
allegedly 
said, "At least m y children wil l have something to eat."   Now, we know today 
what was the relocation.  That was a very bitter irony. 
 

>> Bill Benson:  During that time that you were in Villef ranche, yourmother becam e very ill .  
T e ll u s.
 
>> A le x S h ilo :   S h
e died quite early.  She died in 1941.  My Aunt Cylli  came, was m y m other's 
youngest sister.  She cam ef irst to help m y mother
.  M
y m other used to call herat night when 
she was in pain or when she needed help. And onenight she didn't call her. And my m
other 
was gone. Then m y aunt took over to raiseme. T heref ore I always hada kind of special 
relationship with m y tante. My tantepassedaway.  She was 93.
 
>> Bill Benson: W hatdo you recallabout losing your m om so young at that time?
 
>> A le x S h ilo :   A
t the very beginning I was kind of not affected. I didn't understand it. The day 
m y m other passed away, m y tante had m e dressed at 5:00
 
or 6:00
 
in the morning, threw m e 
o u t.  
ﬁ
Get out.

o tothe street."  And it was a Catholic holiday.  Itwas Ma y

I think May

is God'sfestival or som ething.  I think it's som ething like that. I saw people very happy.  

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

People askedm e, what are you doing soearly?  I said,oh,m y m other died. T hat's all.
 
 
I didn't go tothef uneral.  They didn't take me.  I start
ed to feel it 
about the year
 
--
 
a year later. T hen I started tof eel it. AndI hada special relationship with m y 
aunt andm y sister wh o was m uch older than m e, seven years.  Rem indedm eonce or twice, 
m aybe brutally, you know, Cylli is not your m other. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Youmentionedthis Polish
-
Jewish f am ily. T here wer e other Polish
-Je wish  
fam ilies in the sam etown?
 
>> Alex Shilo:  Ref ugees.  T here were som e15fam ilies.
 
>> Bill Benson: T hatwere Jewish.
 
>> Alex Shilo:  That were Jewish.  I rem em ber exactly the nam es.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You said that thetown's people weren't hostile.
 
>> Alex Shilo:  They were not.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Yet there was so much collaboration going on. W hy do
 
yo u
 
think that was?  
W hy were you able to live relativel y openly? 
 
>> 
Alex Shilo:  I don't know.  They just were not hostile. They were nice people.  Here and 
there youheard som ething
, e
hh, the little Jew boy.  But that was it.
 
 
I had one incident.  I was in the cub scouts. And I went to 
summ er camp twice. T he second time, the cam p was with cub scoutsf rom  other towns. And 

thehead of the cam p summ oned me and twoothers, who were Jewish.  Andhe said," Idon't 
wa n t th em ."
 
>> Bill Benson: T o you?

>> Alex Shilo:  To us.  "I don't wantthem ."   And then one of the counselors, who was alsothe 
m ath teacher of the school, said,"
I
f they go, I go."   Endof  story.  T hat was it. 
 
 
In thataccount, we were very, ver y, ver y lucky.  Very luck y.  And 
som etimes
 
--
 
in thismuseum ,between these walls, I don't consider m yself  to be the typical 
survi vor.  I don't consider m yself.  But still Iam .
 
 
Lateron,about when the Croatians started.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Before we com e to that.  Of course, you rem em bered the incident with the 

anti
-
Sem itic cam pdirector, but you also toldm e youhad another mem ory of  the camp. I think 
that was related to the m usic.  You talked about the little
 
--
 
the m usic f rom  the cam p.  I don't 
know.  You sang a song form eone time thatyou learned in the camp. 
 
>> Alex Shilo:  I sang it at the very end. 
 
>> B ill 
Benson:  Ok. Ok.
 
 
Even though youf elt relatively saf e, youdidn't have many 
incidents like that, there were af ew tim es when you did have to gohide
,  wh
ere youhad to go 
elsewhere. T ell usabout those times.
 
>> Alex Shilo:  That was Sept
em be r
 
1943.  The
re was a sm all garrison of Germ an soldiers 
who actually were Cro atian soldiers,peoplefrom  Croatia. And they set up a mutiny
 a
ga i ns t  
th e ir off ice rs. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  So they were part of the Germ an Arm y.
 
>> Alex Shilo:  They were part of the Germ an Arm y.  They setupam utiny.  Andneedles to 
sa y,  
the Germ an Arm y crushed that inthe most brutal way.  I remember I was at thef riendof  

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

m y tante. W hen thatm utiny started,I st
arted 
to walk hom e.  I was9 years old. And shootings 
here andthere.  I came back hom e,m y tante was f rantic.  Shedid not know if  she had to give 
m ea hug or a spanking.  But that'snot the story.  T he story is the Germ an
s 
imposed curfew.  
And they put poster
s 
in Frenchand Germ anexplaining the curf ew.
  
T he last sentence of the
 
poster said inGermanand in French, don'tbe inf luencedby theBritish and the Jews.  
 
 
T he Jews succeeded to escape, a little luxury in itself .W e went 
to three short train stationsfurther,took the train. W e wenttoa cousin of m ine who was li ving 

i
n the woods.  Hemade a living by producing charcoal. So we went tom y cousin. The 
problem  was to getm y fatherf rom  the train. W eknew exactly whic h trainhe was.  My sister 

andm e, we went to the train station. And the trainhas, what, 10, 12 cars.  
S top s two  m inu te s. 
T here's no tim e to go in the trainand to runthrough. W hat to do?
 
 
T he train starts to move.  Andm y father clim bs outthe window 
of  the train.  So we ran af terthe train.T his isa steam train so they start slowl y.  And we 

started t
o shout to him , dad, go back at the next station and come back.  And that's whathe 
did. 
 
 
W ecame back to VillefrancheI suppose 10 days later when 
things cooled down.
 
>> Bill Benson: T o goback a little bit, when youf irst went to Villef ranche, of  cours
e , tha t pa rt 
of  France, Vichy, France, wasn't asheavily occupied by theGermans.  By 1943 things had
 

changed. T ell us what happenedthere. W hy was there aGermanArm y unit stationed so 
closely at the Croatians' m utiny?

>> Alex Shilo:  No.  France isdivided in 90 districts.  Every school child will tell you that. W e 
hadto learn by heart.  T hat was am ental exercise
, w
hat was the main town and what was the 
secondary towns of each district.  You askme today, I still can recite it.

So, there were

in the head town of  the district was a German
 
ga rri s o n
.  And a very s m all one,m aybe30, 40 guys, notm ore in our town.  But them utiny 
happened at 6:00
 
in the morning.  Andat 10:00
 
you could see theGerm an re
inf o r c em e nt 
com ing down hill. 
 

 
At the very, ver y beginning, the Germ anoccupiedall Franceand 
then they retreated.  I rem ember the beginning of the war we saw Germ an soldiersf rom the 

regular Arm y.  And even I could stutter a littlebit of Germanand a little bit of Yiddish, and I 
could somehow tell them , tell a soldier, where he canbuy cigarettesand stuff like that. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Yourfather,as youm entioned, was on thetrain 
working 
when you got him  
f rom  thetrain.  He was still continuing to see
 
his clients andtravel
 b
ut at trem endous risk to 
him self .
 
>> Alex Shilo:  Yeah. I said at the beginning,m y f atherhad his ID stam ped " Jew."  A red 
stamp. I rem em ber itexactly. W henthey took the train, there was no guarantee we woul d see 
h im  ba ck.   
And I know thatm yf ather went through maybe twice, three tim es, control.  And 
m aybe they let him  gobecause he was French.  Idon't know.  But itwas sheer luck.

I believe that occasionally you were warnedby gendarmes that therem ight be a raid by 
the Germans. So youwould go hide. And som etim es you wentto a schoolteacher's house.
 
>> Alex Shilo: W hathappened was the gendarm es, equivalent of the troopers here, the 
gendarmes warnedm y uncles, m y two uncles, go intohiding. W ehave others to rescue.  
Com eback when things will cool down.
 
 
My sister and I, we went to the science teacher's.  I rem em ber 
exactly.  He had two daughters. Both were between

between m y sister andm e.  
And we slept there in the town.  I think I wentto school even,f rom their house. 
 
Af ter af ew days we just came back hom e. But they were nice enough to take us. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  I rem em ber youtelling m e he had so
m e com ic books.
 
>> Alex Shilo:  Yeah. He had com ic books.T he book was about the botellas and the 
capellos.  Botellas isaboot, and theboot is Italy.  And the capelloswere the helm ets.  And 
these, of course, were the 
G

Ok, so he sold it.  T he sale wa

February
 
1943, they got a letter that the new owner has tof ire the Jew.  T hat's written.

Your father tries to getback a sense of norm alcy f or thef am ily. W hat did youdo then once the

>> Alex Shilo:  Oh, yes.  That was m y f irst year in high school.  High school in France today 
m ight be different.  But in France in thesedays you had elem entary, high school. Elem entary 
six years, high school six years.  T hat's how it worked.
 
 
So I just startedf irst year of  high school.  English, Latin, 
you 
know, whatever.  But I went norm ally to school.  And the year af ter we came back to Paris,and 
m y f ather insisted that I go toa Jewish high school to get the Jewish education.  AndIm ust 
say to this very day the education I got in thisschool is the base of my knowledge of the 
Hebrew language
, t
he gram m ar and all of  that I learned. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Af ter your f ather, your sister,you and your Aunt Cylli, you all survi ved, tellus 
about otherm em bersof  yourf am ily.  You've already shared with us about two cousins who 
were m embers of the resistance. W hat about other members of your fam ily?
 
>> Alex Shilo:  Other m embers were basically m y grandparents
, m
y m other,father and 
m other.  Now I know that it is 1942.  But it was hardfor me to pinpoint exactly
 
the dates.
 
Don't f orget

second letter, we got it

now I know exactl y.  I couldn't rem ember. W ehave tom ove. W e

dug. T hey were told to take off their clothesand they were gunned down directly in the pit.  
T hese were the Jewish population of that town, of Dolina, includingm y grandparents. 
 
 
How I know exactl y the date, Ihave a relative who survi ved the 
war.  He didn't talk anything.  He lost hisf
i rs t  
f
am ily in the same town, in Dolina.  He survi ved 
af term any, m any hardships and rebuilt his life.  He lived inIsrael. Had a great career, etc.  

Andage 86 he decided to write hism em ory.  I got them em ories. Andf rom  thereI know a few 
details.
 
 
My cousin also, the relative
,  
lost his wif e anda small daughter, 5 
years old
 i

the sam em assacre, inthe sam e day. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  And that you learned
 
--
 
>> Alex Shilo:  I learned the datef rom reading the report.  Butm y cousin in Israelnever spoke 
about thatperiod, all of that period, until he had a grandson who was 12,13, who was already 
in the age where he can understand.  So he opened a little bit.  Andthenhedecided to write 
h i s  m emo i r. 
 
 
I gave one copy of  them emoirs in Hebrew, I gave it to the 
m u s eum .
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us about your Uncle Max.  He hada radio after the war.  Right?

He heard
 -- 
hehad nom oney.  He didn't know French.  He heard som e people speaking 
Yiddish on theplatform.  And he said, you know, if  you pay m e a little bit, I will carry your 
luggage.  T his is how he started his career inFrance. So I think more or less they a 
lit t le  b it 
adopted him . Butthewar started.  Andhe was an Austrian citizen in France.  So he was 
assigned to be in thatbig town. 
 
 
Now, in Villef ranche, he had the radio. A radio in France, you 
could
 
have a radio. Itwas not very f requent. It was forbiddento listen to.  You could listen to 
only radio Vichy, the Frenchbroadcaster. T o listen to England wasforbidden. Second, it was 
alwa ys, how do you call it
 
--
 
they tried to interfere
, t
 
m ake it less audible.
 
 
I remember exactly wh at the British radio said. T hey said,"
H
ere 
is London.  Frenchmen are talking to Frenchmen."  [Speaking French]
 
T he signal was,¶ bum , bum , bum , bum¶ which inm orse, morse language, is the letter V, 

victor y.  T he sam e sign as Churchill.  I rem em ber it started exactly with 
th a t. 
 
 
Now, one sad thing at the endof  the war.  Maybe this is what 
you relate to. Af ter the war was over I com eto m y uncle. W e listened to the radio. And Isee 
his wif e sobbing.  Quietly.  You know, sobbing and crying. W hat happened was the radiow
a s 
broadcasting all the nam esof  the Frenchprisoner
s 
of war who were liberated and com ing 
home.  Now, m y uncleand m y tante
 
hada son who was killed in 1940.  He was a young off icer 
in the French Arm y.  He was killed in April orMay
 
1940. And, of course, her son was not 
co m in g ba ck.  
 
 
On the otherhand, I rem em ber exactly the exhilaration in the

town, in the little town about
 
theendof the war.  I rem em ber even the nice lady who tried to 
sing, a big gathering.  Here and there shem issed af ew tunes.  I rem em ber that. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  You had told us earlier that yourf atherhad paid hisrent on your apartment in 
Paris into t
hef uture acouple of  years. And thenaf ter the war he went to get theapartment 
b a ck.  

>> Alex Shilo:  My f ather keptpaying the rentin Paris, inthe apartment, until theGermans 
sealed the apartment and stole whatever was in.  But after the war, we came
 
back to Paris.  
And m y father wanted for 
se
ntim ental reasons, his apartm ent, hisapartment. T here was a 
legal battlebecause the actual dweller to whom  the apartm ent hadbeen given was a French 
veteran, an invalid, a war invalid.  And I rem em bereven there was a picture in the newspaper 
showing that French invalid with a
n  
arm m issing.  But af ter the legalbattle, m yf atherheaded 
back. And this is actually where he spent his last
 
--
 
m ore or lesshis last day.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You told us a little bit earlier thatfor yourf ather, though, af ter that he hada 
tough tim e af ter the war. 
 
>> Alex Shilo: W ell,my father was worn out. He was a widower.  H e didn't care muchabout 

lif e.  My f atherhad a great tim e with hisdaughter andm y sister.  Becausehehas
 
t wo  
granddaughters.  He saw them growing.  I'm notherefor conf ession, but I was m aybenot the

he was already too old and too warn out

m oved to
 
Israel.  Soon af ter you arrived, joined the IsraeliArm y, and soon af ter you joined the 
Israeli Arm y Eichmann was tried. W ill you tell us about that?
 
>> Alex Shilo:  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  I joinedthe IDF almost upon arrival in Israelfor one simple 
reason
.  I wanted itbehind m e.  I wanted it to beover.  I wantedto start a real lif e. Real lif e 
doesn't start in them ilitary, but I spent two years.  I rem em ber exactly.  February
 
1961.  March.  
1961. T hatday, in thecam p, we had nothingplanne
d.  W e were
 
sitting on the 
wa lls.  It wa s 
theday of  theopening of Eichm ann's trial.
 
 
Now, Eichm ann,for those who don't know, was the man in 
charge of  the solution to the Jewish problem . In short,he was in charge of them ass 
exterm ination.  He was caughtby 
what 
is known today to be the Mossad
, brought to Israel to 
trial.  That was the opening of  the trial. 
 
 
I remember, we were sitting in m ilitary gear on the walls, 
listening to the sm all radio. W eheard the opening of  the trial. And the f irst question
 
--
 
it  is
 
a 
crim inal trial.  So the f irst question you ask,are you Mr.
 
So
-
an d

so? You have to identif y the 
accused.  So,are youAdolph Eichm ann? T he question was translated into Germ an. Andyou 

couldhear,I rem em ber until now, his voice. He said,[speaking G

.  
" Y
es, indeed."
 
You could sense through the radio a shiver in the courtroom . W e got the right guy.

there was not a weekor something withoutany shouting

during his time there were two m ajor

that.  It was Iraq.  My grandson is now in theAir Force.  On onehand, we're proud.  It's a 
fam ily tradition. T he parents went.T he grandparents, theparents. And now they are going.

I have ver y little hope that m y

wars.  And there is a saying in the Book of Sam uel, it is said thatthe eternity of Israel will not
