Question: My name is Dr. Henry Lustagazal
er and this intervie
w is sponsored by th e 
United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, the 
Department of Oral History. If we could 
just start with your name, date 
of birth and wh ere you were born.
 
Answer: My name is Rafael 
Wilschanski. And I'm born in November, 1924; (coughs) in 
a little town called Radom. That's  it. 
 
Q: Tell me a little bit  you were
  you were brought up in Ba
tumi, GeorgiA: That's where 
you spen t your ch ildhood. And what was Batumi
 known for, in terms of Jewish religious 
life? Was it a  was there a centra
l yeshiva there or otherw ise? 
 

A: Okay . Really, I don't reme mb er exactly the 
 the town  because I was  I was very, very 
little when we lived in 
the town of Batumi. Batumi is a 
big  a big city, a port city. And 
got  I don 't know exactly how many Jewi
sh people were th ere, how big it was the 
community  Jewish community . But it was a community of sephardi Jews and a  and 
ashkenazic Jews, which means European Jews a
nd the Jews from  when
 born in  in  in 
Georgia itself. I don't remember a lot because
 I was very, very y
oung then, very  little. 
When  we left Batumi, I was only a year and a 
half. So I can 't tell much  much of  of 
details about the community 
in th e  in the town.   
 
Q: Okay . Your parents 
were from the Ukraine. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And your father was, as I rememb
er you mentioning to me, was a shochet?
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And he attended the original yeshiva in L
ubavitch, Ukraine. Could you tell me a little 
bit about your father? Who were his teac
hers, personalities he met when he was in 
Lubavitch community?
 
A: As you said it, my father was a shochet. 
That was his job for  all the time, but he was 
ordain ed rabbi too, a Rav. And he didn't  pr
actice directly rabbonis, directly he was a 
shochet. But all the time the shochet, it wasn 't 
so  so easy in the  
in this time, in  in 
RussiA: 
 
Q: Well, let's  let's 
talk about that. What was your lif
e like growing up before the war 
under communism? How did you continue 
Jewish practices under communism, which 
was, at least officially, atheist?
 
A: Okay . We were  it was a very, very hard  
time. But I can't tell you that I felt it because 
I was very, very young. And, 
you know, when  you are born in  
this  in this atmosphere, 
you are used to  to see  you think th at that's 
th e way this has to be. Th
at's what you think.  
You didn't see otherwise. It wasn't  a Jewish
 school. I didn't go to a Jewish school. It 
wasn't a cheder. It wasn't a  a 
yeshivA: So my father learned w
ith  with me, to read and to 
write He  Hebrew and  Hebrew and the  the bible, the chumish and rashi, all these things. 

And zoy it was going. And it wasn't for a l
ong time because you can't live in one place 
very long. So, when I was a  about a year and 
a half, we left already Batumi. We left for 
another  another little  a little  a to wn calle
d Nevel. It's  about 
 I don't know exactly 
how  how  how far it is from Leningrad, from 
Petersburg. Because there, in this time, 
about in '26, '27, it was there 
still  even it wasn't 
really  really op  openly, but it was still 
a  academy for  rabbinical academy. My father 
land before his  before his marriage, he 
land in Lubavitch.  Lubavitch 
now is in  now is known in
 the world as a  as a big 
community. But then it was only the little  th e or
iginal town of Lubav itch.  Lubavitch was 

a  a little to wn th at got only 400 Yidissha 
families, about 400 Yidissha families. And 
the  most of the families lived around the ye
shivA: Because the yeshiva, the Lubavitch 
yeshiva there, she was  she was founded in
 19  tuf, reish, nun, zayin  it was about 
a  about, 1917  no. Nineteen
 seven, something like this
. Nineteen hundred seven. 
 
Q: Uhhuh.
 
A: My father come to the yesh
iva it was al  already  already 
a  in the  (inaudible)  16th 
year of the yeshivA: And th at  that was th
e yeshiva and  and that was the foundation of 
Lubavitch community in the  the  all  all 
the rabbis of Lubavitch,
 the dynasty of the 
Schneerson. Was  in the beginning it wasn 't 
called Schneerson. It was called Schneurie. It 
was called  it was called, other 
families. Then, in the third ge
neration, it became the name 
of Schneerson. And the  the fifth  the fifth rabb
i of this  dyn  dyna 
 dynasty, he founded 
the yeshiva in Lubavitch.  
 
And when my father come  co
me, it was already about 15 year
s in the yeshiva, it was just 
in the peak to sa
ying some of the best times of the 
 of the yeshivA: And then, in a few 
years, it was the  he have to leave, because 
then it was  started the first world  world war. 
And that was my father from then.  
 
And then  he  he left the yeshiva and he marri
ed. And then he mar  he married in the  in 
the city of Kherson in  in Uk
raine. And then from there, he went to  to Batumi. Before 
going to Batumi, my father was 
in Rostov, because it was alrea
dy after  just after the first 
world. It was in 1921. 1921. He
 went to the  he went to the Lubavitch Rebbe, wh at  who 
immigrated from Lubavitch to Rostov, My str
ovia, Ru ssiA: And when he was there, the 
Lubavitcha  he didn't  got a job in th
is mo ment, because he  he got already 
his  ordain  ordain ed from also a Rabbi, also
 a  and also shochet. And he didn't got a  a 
steady job in  this mo ment. And the Rabbi called 
him and told him, here is now the role of 
the City of  of Batumi. That was before I wa
s bor  born. Yes, no. No . Just  and told him 
here is the Rau of the City of Batu mi and 
he needs a shochet, a shochet and a ch azzan. 
And I wanted you to  go with him together an
d be the  there the sh
ochet for the  for the 
European community
 in  the city of  gai. So he went there and he was shochet. 
 
Q: But your education, itsel
f, you were, as we would call 
here, homeschooled? Your  it 
was your father who was your main teacher  in  in a  thro
ughout your childhood?
 
A: Yes. My father was my  my  my  my 
teacher till seven, eight years. Back when we 
went seven, eight years, we were already in
  seven years almo st, we were already in a 
fifth place in  in  in the  in 
the  in the five  in the six ye
ars of my  of my childhood, we 
were already in fifth place. We can't stay in
  anyplace das because the prosecution was 
very, very , hard against the religion. And bein
g a shochet, it was against  against the  the 
whole  the whole communism, the whole idea of comm unism.  
 

And wh erever  you came in a  in a city, wh
at are you doing? Who we
re your parents?  
Was he workers in places or were  was he  brokers, meant broker  people, commerceson, 
people  commer cial  people with this. No, 
that 's alr eady not good, not good for us. We 
don't  we don't need you. This is a  a  a comm unity of work ers, not of a  of a  of people 
that doesn't  work  and living on somebody's a
ccount. That was they 
saying, the religious 
cleric  clericals. 
 
Q: So hence that was  the reason for the  
for the  for the move
ments  for the  the 
movement from one city to th
e next, your father's move?
 
A: Sure. Wh en you can't buy  be 
here because when you come in
 a city, you have to go to 
the police and to  register. And th ey started to  they started to as
k you who you are, you 
have  who are your parents, and 
all this is. No, we don't need 
you. You can't live  live in 
our to wn  here. And you are not  not a citizen
 on the same level th
at  everybody. You 
are  don't h ave the  the right to vote. And on
ce you are not  you are not a  not a citizen 
exactly, to say. It's
 a second class. 
 
Q: Can we switch to y
our mother's family. 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: And tell me a little bit about 
your mother and her family 
and  from the same towns as 
your father? 
 
A: Not in the same to wn, but
 around, from Ukraine; the sa
me thing. Ukraine, there 
is  there is  there was in  from times  fro
m th e third  from the se
cond  second Lubavitcha 
Rabbi, Lubavitcha Rabbi, he bought, from the 
government, the Czar government  in these 
years it was in  in the beginning of 1800  in
 the end of 17  from 1700
s. He bought a big, 
big, big place. And th ere  he sent there Yi
dden to work 
on the ground, 
to work on the 
ground. And it was a lot of  of  it  it called colonies, Jewish colonies. And my  mo ther is 

from this colony. The whole fa
mily is from there.
 My   my  mo th er 's
 father was too a 
shochet in a  a little co lony called Romanovka
, RomanovkA:  And there he was das  and 

the whole family come from Lubavitcha
  from Lubavitcha 
families from  from 
generations. And that  that  
 
Q: I'm sorry. Can you explai
n, in this time before the 
war, from your memory, after the 
second world war, obviously ev en after the firs
t world war, can you explain to  me what a 
typical Shabbat night or yom tovim night, if
 you can, in your 
mind, put yourself 
 
A: When? What time? 
 
Q: Right after  after the first world war. 
 
A: I can 't tell you nothing after the first wo
rld war because I was born  born already  
 

Q: No, I know that. I'm saying 
 
A:  much later. 
 
Q: Before the second wo
rld war began. Befo re the second wo rld war began.
 
A: Before the second war? 
 
Q: Yes. If  if you could just 
describe a typical Shabbat night.
 
A: It  it depends. I can't tell you general, 
because everybody  ev
ery family has their 
Shabbat. It was very, very hard
 to keep Shabbat, first of a
ll. The  you know, th e Soviet 
then installed a week of  five  five days of
 wo rk. The sixth day is a  a rest day. So it 
was  it  it didn't  it wasn't a Shabbas, to say 
 t o  say  a  a Jewish Shabbas. And that 's what 
they did. Because they didn't 
want to  to  the religion, it wasn't a Shabbas. It wasn 't 
lahaudil, a Sunday. No religion. This  this we
ek, it is  it is Thursday, the other week it 
was Friday, the other week it was Monday. Yo
u see? But the families that still hold the 
religion, it was very, very hard. If somebody 
didn't  come  to do wo rk, he was fired and 

he  you looked for all kinds of 
how to  how to keep 
a little bit of Shabbas,  to not to forget 
that there is a Shabbas. But in
  in my house, for example,
 it was  it  was  Shabbas was 
Shabbas. My  father was a shochet, bet  better,  or worse, in Parnasa,
 in this, but Shabbas 
was Shabbas. We were eating all together, th
e family was here. But it was always under 
very, very amyrid (ph)  afra
id. Because every  every minute, you can have a knock in the 
door and that  who, what are you doing? And 
th ey take you and you are in Siberian. You 
see? But the Shabbas, in my house, what I re
member, from  from  my
 childre  chil  it was 
very nice. The family  we were not a big fa
mily, four kids, father and mother. Shabbas 
was Shabbas. A kiddish and this. And still  it 
was still  still a  a s
ynagogue. And we lived 
in the synagogue. We lived in  
in synagogue there. It  it  
it  it was my father, officially, 
says that he was the  the keeper. He was a  
a chamber, a guardian, of the  of the build ing. 
No. Bu t he was a shochet. He was a shochet. Da
s. And officially he was. And that's all. 
And I tell you what was  when I was twe  twe  
twe  seven  seven  eight years we come in 
this war  in this fifth place, in fifth  place 
from my  from my
  from my  childhood. It was 
called Verones. That in central Russia, one of
 the places that was 
very, very  in the 
second world  second world war it was big fight
s there; very, very  big fights. Verones, 
Kursk, Netszkeiv, Moscow.  Then Verones in
 the center, you see? There we were. And 
that was, for us  for us was a Shabbas, lik
e their Shabbas. My father was learning with 
me, to write and to read  to 
read in Russian; this I learned 
by myself, I learned this. You 
see?  
 
Q: You mentioned the 
 
A: There is no yeshiva, no ched er, and das. 
It was Lubavitch yeshiv
a, officially, it was 
closed. 
 

Q: But everything work ed underground?
 
A: Okay. In  in  in this time,
 in  in  in Verones, where we were, when I was eight years 
old, about eight years, then was there a few 
older  older  young  
young  young bochurim, 
young  young people, and they  
were learning in the shul undergro und.  Because the  the 
yeshiva was already closed. It was  after 
'27 Lubavitcha Rebbe was chased out from 
RussiA: He was arrest e d  and this, and all yesh ivas were closed. No 
 no yeshivas. But two, 
three bochurim here, two, three young people 
here. And when they were in our town, 
Verones, you learned with me. 
You learned with me. Then my  father was a bisel free 
from this work. And it was then
 three bochurim and a  and two younger one, five, ten, 
and they  were changing. And one month so
mebody learned with me, the other month 
another one. And it was going till I was 12 ye
ars old. But 12 years old it was already 
impossible, because we were not  not going 
in  the public schools and everybody, why th e 
kids are not going in  public school? It was 
very, very dangerous. 
If the  if the  the 
government would  would know. 
You don't want to  to lear
n your kids communism with 
all these things? So  I  I  my   my  parents se
nt me out from my  house. My sister, they sent 
her to my  grandmother in Ukrain e somewhere.
 Then that  when so
mebody come, it's  not 
in the place, nobody knows wher
e, she's a little girl then. And my brother was younger 
than me. He doesn't g o  in school, that's  all. 
And send him to learn the fiddle, to learn the 
fiddle. In the mo rning he was going and th
en after his lesson he was going somewhere 
and co ming back. And people are thinking that
 he was in school. And so  and so it was. 
 
Q: And yourself? And yourse
lf, where were you sent?
 
A: Where I was sent? I  was sent before them in
 Kursk. Before then I was sent in Kursk.  
That  Kursk is a  a night  to travel a night from 
Varones, in the all night. 
In the  in the  it's 
300 kilometers, something 
like this, from this. And I was just 12 years old. 
 
Q: So in this atmosphere  in this 
atmo sphere of religious persecution and 
families  because of that persecution, familie
s breaking up, in this very difficult moment, 
when  did you first hear of the Nazis and the i
nvasion that was to occur June 22nd, 1941?  
 
A: The Naz  the Nazis with 
the Russia were always the biggest enemies. You know?  
The  the  the Fascism, they called it, the Fa
scist. I don't know exactly wh at is the real 
word for Fascist. But till 
 till thirty  '39 when
 it was the pact, the Ru ssian with the  with 
the Germans, we didn't heard wh at was going on 
th ere. And when  they made the pact of 

this, okay, it was  you didn't   you didn't  hear
 exactly what's yemach
 shmey, Hitler's ideA: 
And even  when  the  when  a  
when the war  when the world war started already, a lot of 
people stayed with the German
s because  because they knew 
in this time it was all the 
people they knew from World Wa
r I. And then it was very good 
with the  with
 the  with 
the Deutsch, with the 
Na  with the Germans.
 

So it  it can't be worse. Can't be worse th
an we are now here in the Soviet Russian 
communism. So, the Germans are coming; very
 good, very good. 
Everyone was very 
happy. And then started to hear th
at it's not  not so  so  so
 rosy. And then it was  people 
started their vacation. And other people said, 
no, it's not  not real. That was  was the 
propaganda, the comm unist propaganda used to 
say. And they stayed
 with the Germans, 
nebach . We  we stayed there. And nobody kn
ows where  what it  what it was ex actly with 
everybody. 
 
Q: But in your family situati
on, what exactly was the change 
that occurred in your family 
situation with the Germans  with the Germ
an invasion? How did it affect your family? 
 
A: Okay. I wasn't home. When th
e  in '41 I was  in this time
 I was in  Georgia; in Russia, 
Georgia, in Kurk a (ph). Okay. We
 heard that the family  the 
war started. And a  the first 
time it took still, it was a blitz  a blitz war, yo
u know, very  very  very fast. But still it 
took a few times and we didn't k n ow exactly
 what  what was going on. For example, I 
wasn't home, but we were  already got the c
on  contact by post, by writing letters, here 
and here. And I  I knew that 
fami ly  fro m my  mo th er 's si d e  
and from my father's side, it 
was his mo ther, his  his brother and my  mo ther
's si ster, t w o sisters, they come all in 
Verones. All what we got in Verones, it was 
one  one big room. And 
in this big room it 
was all  all together, all together. But it didn't
 took lo ng time that we got to run  run away  
from there. Where we v

 And they  are drinking very mu

70,000 people, 50,000 Yiddin.
 And there it was still little 
synagogues. And we  how we were learning th
ere? You know how we were learning?  In 
a synagogue, that after we  we got and asked th
e  the gabbae  the  the nu  the direction of 
the synagogue. Because for them it was, too, 
it was very dangerous to
 hold such  such 
people against  against the das, against the 
government. Okay. We were coming four, five 
o'clock in the mo rning. We would come and 
I snuck in  the second  in  the second floor. 
And the Shamash, how you call 
it? How you call the Shamash? 
 
Q: The guardian. 
 
A: The guardian of th is school, in the  our  
our teacher was  was com  coming there.  And 
he was  he was with us to teach us for tw
o hours, something like this. And the guardian 
was closing the door outside. And then he
 was coming back to open. And two  two 
together, two, three boys were 
going in one place, and then to
 a second place to  to make 
homework. Okay , say homework. To go over what
 we learned and th is. And that's it. And 
it  it only was when  because it was a Lubav
itch Rebbe. The only th
ing what holded us, 
all of us, you see, is when because the Lu
bavitch Rebbe. And the first thing that sank 
over there, whatever it is, it was in
  in this time, when they arre
sted us, the  all of this, and 
das, they arrested us, they arrested in 
the all of Ru ssia, hundreds of Lubavitcha, 
Hassidim, Lubavitch Hassidim, a
nd hundreds of  of  of relig
ious Yiddin in general.  And 
you asked if there was a role. There was a  
some Rabonamin in  in Vedicu. Wh at was it? 
They were all shot. They was all shot. We  we
 escaped  escaped, to say like this.  They 
hold us for five weeks in the En Kavaday. But 
we were  we were  we were  juniors. How 
you say? How you say? Kids. We
 went  we went still  16 years means already an adult. 
And we went before in  belo
w 16 years, what can they  wh
at can they do with us? The 
older ones, there was 16 years, where that's 
one year, one year, three years and that's , you 
know  
 
Q: Something th at you said in one of our earli
er talks, Mr. Wilschanski, really impressed 
me. That with the German invasion, and gi
ven this entire description that you are 
explaining, under Soviet rule, that when  the 
Germans invaded, you mentioned to me that 
persecution, religious persecu tion, actually went down.
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: I wonder if you co uld just elaborate on that. 
 
A: What? 
 

Q: When   you're saying that wh en the  you 
mentioned to me when the Germans invaded, 
religious persecution actually diminished. It we
nt down. I wonder if you could just speak 
to that.
 
A: Yeah, because the government was occupied
 with the  with th
e war. And they didn't 
look so much. First of all, the job was already 
very much done. 
Second of all, very  very, 
very many, even religious
 people, Yiddin, were in the front
, on the  on the  on the nu  but 
the first lines of the  of the war, and this. 
It didn't look like this in  in another  in 
another  in another side of Russia, in Sommerc
ant (ph). In  that is in Azerbaijan, Asian. 
Then, because it was a bisel much  better, the yeshiva was already a yeshivA:  It was their 
cheder. It was das. Okay, it wasn't  it wasn 't
 official. B u t, they  it was already 70, 80 
students, little students, das. But it was much, 
much better. And one of the  of the  the 
reasons was because then, in thes
e times, they made a pact with
  with Poland. And a lot, a 
lot, a lot of Polish Jews were in Siberian, in 
the  in the time of the 
 of the war. And then 
Russia made a  a  a  a  a contact with
 Poland to  send out to  mu ch people is 
arrested  arrested there in Siberian, tens a
nd hundreds of thousands 
of Yiddin  didn't come  
back. When they 
come back, they came 
 where they came?  They're in Asian and in 
a  and in a  and in a  in a Georgia, in thes
e places. And thousands, thousands, thousands, 
thousands of Yiddin was  come
 from SiberiA: Nu, and they go
t with  a contract with das 
and the Yiddin, the Poli
sha Yiddin, and they started to rebuild a little bit, to rebuild their 
life. So the government didn't look at 
them. Later, a little bit, when it was 
the  the  after  after  after the war, it started again. 
 
Q: Right. But during  during 
 
A: I wasn't there already. 
 
Q: But during th e period of the war, it seems that  you were with  with a group of boys in 
this underground yeshiv a and mo ving around.
 And there mu st have been a tremendous 
comradery amongst you. 
 
A: Tremendous what? 
 
Q: A tremendous friendship.
 
A: Okay. Sure. 
 
Q: Would you say it was 
a tremendous friendship?
 
A: Sure. We are brothers.  
 
Q: Uhhuh. Uhhuh. And 
 
A: We are brothers. You don't se
e now in the  in the young ge
neration, that's  what I look 
on th e young generation and I don't see. 
 

Q: So you  you we
re like brothers? 
 
A: Huh? 
 
Q: But you were also a religious community . So there mu st have been tremendous  
 
A: Sure, but it's another kind of life, anot
her feeling. Yo u know, when   wh en you are 
pressed a little bit, and you kno
w that you have  y
ou have to be against something, you 
awake your  your force, your  your strength, like that. 
 
Q: And how was your religious stre
ngth at that time, in terms of 
 
A: Much better than now. 
 
Q: Uhhuh.
 
A: Much better than now in  in
 what  what  thank God, we are in a free land and you can 
do whatev er you want. But it's not the same feeling. 
 
Q: Explain  explain that fee
ling; as a young boy in an un
derground religious community 
and this sense of HaShem that is there for 
you and  and yet, everything seems so out of 
control and constant police interrogations and fear of the police, in Kavidar?
 
A: Okay , but we  we  we knew that it can't 
be otherwise. When you are  you know th at is 
your way to go. And you got what to thank,
 HaShem, and the Rebbe. You always thought 
about the Rebbe, the Rebbe, the Rebbe, the Rebbe
. But who thought that
 will come a time 
that we'll b e in a free land, in a fr
ee world, and do wh atever you want. 
 
Q: Was there communication from  for example, was there a kind of a grapevine, some 

communication to th e Rebbe, that you heard things about the Rebbe?
 
A: Through Russia? In Russia? 
 
Q: Yes.
 
A: Being in Russia, after the Rebbe was  wa
s exposed, you can say, because, you know, 
he was arrested and he was even  it was  it wa s 
his life. It was the firs
t  the first  that was 
dead. Then  is 10 years in SiberiA:
 Because the whole world stand up. 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: I have to 
stop because the mic fell off.
 
A: Excuse me?
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We're ro lling again. 
 
Q: Can you tell me, with the boys
 that you were with in the 
 in the underground yeshiva, 
did some of them  did they co me to Crown Heights? Did they  did some go to Israel?  
Where  where did the majority of the boys end up?
 

A: Now? 
 
Q: Yeah. There  some of them are gone
, clearly, but where did they emigrate?
 
A: Now, in Gan Eden . That now  
now it's  it's all  
that's from all of these boys what you 
see here, they have here one, in an old age ho
me. And one is a  a lit
tle bit older than me. 
And the other ones are all gone. 
 
Q: Did th ey come to America?
 
A: Who? 
 
Q: These boys that you're speaking ab out. 
 
A: One  one is here now. 
 
Q: Uhhuh.
 
A: And the second one is an old 
age home here in America, yes. 
 
Q: Uhhuh.
 
A: And the other ones  no, they  were coming 
here to the Rebbe in America, but not  not 
living in AmericA: 
 
Q: Uhhuh.
 
A: Not living in  AmericA: 
 
Q: What did you  during th is time, what did 
you know of the war, of the Holo caust that 
was occurring in  in  in the east, in  Estonia,
 Latvia, Lithuania and also in the west? Did 
you hear anything ab ou
t these situations?
 
A: Very late. Very late. You  you know, in Ru
ssia, everything is censored. Cen  censored, 
you say, yes? 
 
Q: Uhhuh. Uhhuh.
 
A: Nu. So you didn't  didn't  
know  know a lot. Later we he
ard but very, very many people 
didn't  believe it even. Nu, th
at's  the commu nism, the communist propagandA:  And that's 
it. 
 
Q: In that communist propaganda, did you have
 a sense that, in your situation, over and 
above the  the continuou
s religious persecution, that the  the German invasion put the 
entire population at risk, or did you have the 
feeling that the Jews who are in particular 
situation of risk?
 
A: From which side? From the  from the Germans? 
 

Q: From the Germans. 
 
A: Yes, we started to hear it. 
 
Q: Okay .
 
A: We started to hear it already. 
 
Q: Uhhuh.
 
A: But  but not in  not in   in '41, '4 2. Late
r. Later we start to. It was Jewish soldiers that 
came back. They told
 a little bit. But it  it  
it took time because the 
 the Germans were in 
Russia a  a  a  a little time. 
Then till Russia come back to see what is going on in the 
places that were before taken by the Germans,
 it took time. And then we started to  to 
hear what  what were going on
. Otherwise we didn't k n ow. 
 
Q: You mentioned that  you didn't know. Yo
u mentioned that you had contact with your 
family during th is time and you were
 sending them tea, et ceterA: 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Any other kind of c
ontact? You had letters?
 
A: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 
Okay, you know, this war time, it was very, very hard in 
the  in  the post with all these things, but 
we got contacts. See, it  it wasn't cellu lars, 
(chuckle), it wasn 't  it telephones. It
 wasn 't th at. But letters, yes. Yes. 
 
Q: How  do you rememb er how your father recalled his time of separation from his 
children, from you? Do   do you recall your fa
ther talking about this
 time, the hardships 
that he endured durin g this 
 
A: Not too much. My sist
er speak about it, in 
 in what  wh atever he go th rough. But my  
father didn 't  wasn 't
 speaking about it much. 
 
Q: Uhhuh. During th is time, as a  Mr. Wilschan
ski, as a  as a  as a young man, as a boy, 

living aw ay from your  your parents, do y
ou rememb er, for example, something that 

placed you in a certain situation,
 where your education, where your religious beliefs, that 
helped you make a decision to
 go one way or to go anot
her way; something that  I 

would  you were so  you were 
 you were in such an  indepe
ndent situation and you had to 
rely on your upbringing and you had to rely 
on your religious beliefs to make decisions 
for yourself. Is there one particular 
thing th at stands out in your mind?
 
A: I'll tell you, it wasn't about 
any thought in th ese things. We 
 we knew that we have a  a 
way to go. And that's it. B
ecause, you know, like, this 
man that made this escap e 
from  from there  fro
m then, when we were in
 Necadayna, and then  
afterward in a  in a 

home for children, for  and then
 they sent us from Necadayna
 to a children's h o me.  And 
he said, we  we brought through th
e flag of the  of the Army, see? 
 
Q: Uhhuh.
 
A: It was  it was caput, like they say in Dach
au. But it was  in the old Russia, it was a 20, 
25, maybe 13, boychicla, boychi
cs, and a few older  older, like  like our teacher, that 
didn't  look at themself. Whatever it will be 
it will be. But we have to go the way that 
Lubavitcha Rebbe told for us. When  when 
 w h en  th e co mmu n i sts co
me, his father, this 
Rebbe  this Rebbe's fatherinlaw's father told
, I don't say exactly wh
en they will go down, 
but to hold the relig
ion we  you have to go till the last 
 th e last drop of blood.  Okay? And 
that was we know. We didn't  know  every  ev
erything, how it will be we didn't  know. But 
every  every time we gave him something, ma
y HaSh em help us, to see the Rebbe, to go 
in his ways, to do what he wants from us. And th
at's  the  the  the general goal of the  of 
the diasporA: That holds us, the diaspora, for th
ousands of years, not only in   in  in our 
little world. Because we look fo rwards. We lookfo rwards.  And  and  and we look what 
to leave over for  for the coming generation. 
 
Q: Did your  your entire family 
made it back; they
 all survived?
 
A: No. No. A lot of the family
 fro m min e  mo m, mo th er 's  si
de, stayed what it  what it 
does, we don't know ex actly wh ere. We know  
 
Q: But your imme
diate family   
 
A: Huh? 
 
Q: Your immediate family  
 
A: Baruch HaShem, two sisters, a 
brother, me and my  parents. Nu. 
 
Q: Do you recall the first mo
ment that you were reunited 
with your family? Were you 
reunited as a fami ly or onebyone: Your sister
 came back at a different time, your father, 
your mo ther?
 
A: Just when the  when the wo
rld ended, in '3 5, and then it 
still was much be
tter that they 
said before in the  in the Asian, in So
mmercant dash cant. Then
 my parents came from 
Kazakhstan is much  much farther. Still, th
ey came  coming to 
Sommercant, an d I was 
there, too. And it was already in '46, in th e 
beginning of '46. And th
en my siste rs mar ried 
and as Polish  Poland citizens 
we got out from the Russian  
from the Russia/Soviet Russia 
in the  December of 1946. 
 
Q: Perhaps 
 
A: And then   then we  
then we come together. 
 

Q: We'll stop here, Mr. Wilsch
anski. We'll take a little b reak and then we'll continue 
again in  in 10 minutes.
 
A: Okay .
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Okay. Tape 
is rolling. Stand by. Let me just let it go for a little 
bit. (Showing picture.) Stand by 
again. And we're ready any time. 
 
Q: Mr. Wilschanski, wh at's your memo ry of
 the mo ment the war was declared over? 
What was that memory about?
 
A: This moment I was  it was the 9th of May,
 1945. This moment I 
was in a little village 
in a  in a  Georgia, because we can't be all to
gether in one  one place, you see? It was very 
dangerous. So it was a few young boys here
, a few young boys here. In this time it was 
already older. It was about 19 y
ears, something like this. We di
dn't  got directly a teacher.  
Was sitting by ourself learning a little bit, pr
ivate houses and this. And I remember, it 
was  it's a village in GeorgiA: In this moment 
it's a  a really Jewish village. It got one  one 
payen  one not  not Jewish family that left 
there. But was, for Shabbas, everything what 
you needed, he was  he knew already ev ery 
family, every this. And it was coming and 
putting the  the warm to  
to warm the house with th ese things. And I remember 
that  that  in the central  central  central 
street, it was not  not very  big, maybe  maybe a 
kilometer and a half, someth
ing like this, somebody on a hor
se was going and a  and was 
screaming lauda (ph)  okay, the 
war is ended. That's  that what das. And it was already a 
yontif. Everybody went out from the houses  and was singing, laughing and this. The 

world is das. All Micatavda  th
at  that's the word
 in a  in a  in a Saccatwel (ph), in 
Georgian. Oh Micatavda, in a horse, he was 
going on the whole  in the whole street and 
announcin g it. And that was das. That was I re
me mb er fro m th is ti me 
 this time. And then 

it started a new  everybody star
ted to think what will be now,
 nu. And then in  everybody 
started to  to bandage the  the injuries. 
 
Q: And when did you  when  di
d you begin  you mentioned ear
lier that you began to have 
information about the Ho
locaust, both in the east, the  
th e mass murders, the ansatsuken 
and also in the west. And you 
began to hear about that late
r in the war. But after the war 
now, wh at information coming back about th
e extermination camps,
 the concentration 
camps, the murder, 
mass graves in 
 
A: Okay , still it took  it took very  long to ev
er cochin (p h), how y
ou say, to  to go  
 
Q: To come out.
 
A: To go through. What? 
 
Q: For it to come out.
 

A: Yes. To understand what 
is going on. People were  
were shocked. No body could 
believe that it was like this. But one  one 
people come, second people come, people 
come  people come. They were 
going to look for  for familie
s in the  in the towns where 
they  wh ere they lived
. Every time that the Russian took a
nother  another city, where they 
took over back, it come a new  new  new de
tails of all these th
ings. We didn't  knew 
exactly  think that Auschwitz
, Dachau, these things. Later 
we heard that it was special 
camps.  But we knew that it was an extermin
ation. How it come exactly, we didn't knew 
the first time. Then it  people  come from there, every  everything is  is no families, no 
nothing. Nothing, 
nothing, nothing from  
from big families, th
at's it. Nobodyknows 
the  the population. Oh yeah
, the Germans took th e Jews, and sent them away.  No. 
 
Q: And this  this information came back to
 the community. May I ask, after the war, what 
was religious life like in the fo
rmer Soviet Un ion? Was it as bad? Was the persecution as 
bad as before, as you were 
explaining, or was it a different level of persecution? 
 
A: I can't tell you ex actly. It seems, what we 
hear from people that left  left here, that 
stayed here  because I left Russi
a in  in  in December of 1946
. It's  all  all  only a year and 
something after the  th e war. Y
ou got very, very difficult to 
 to come  come out with 
the  the whole population of 
Poland, with this. But we di
dn't knew exactly what's going 
on later, you see? We hear that later  later it 
was very, very hard. Th
at was people that 
come later and they said that
 it's  not better than it was be
fore. And even  even till '53, 
when Stalin, Stalin was dead, 
they said it was even worse. Because he was a maniac and 
he started again and again and ag ain to exterm
inate all  whatever it 
took. He thought that 
it's against him. And that's 
what we heard already wh en we
 were out. Because it  it  it 
didn't  took a long time, a few time till they star
ted again back. It took already a month  a 
month  a year and something. 
 
Q: You left the Soviet Union and went wh ere?
 
A: We went to Poland. That  that was the fi
rst destination. That was the immigration from 
the Polish Yiddin. And we went 
to Poland. But in Poland we
 stayed only  only 10 days. 
 
Q: Where in Poland?
 
A: Huh? Wh ere in Po land? Sh amishel (ph). Sh
amishel. That's just o v er  over the  the 
border. We  we come there and we  and we th
ought that we are already in the paradise.  
We left RussiA: We are in paradise. We  we co
me out of the  of the  of the train, of the 
train. It was  the train, it wa
s Echelon. Echelon was the viol  violence for  for  for  for 
pain, for death, such violence. Nu . Such  violen
ce. When we went  we come in the station, 
and we see there is bread, there is herring, th
ere is whatever you want for eating, brown 
from dusk, we thought  people  
we didn't see it in Russian fo
r the last  last time, you see? 
And we thought in Gan Eden . So we asked th
e people wh ere a shul because we had to 

wait to change  to change trains from this  
from this time a  aboa
rd; aboard other times. 
Even the  the  how you call it, the  you ha
ve to tell because th
e  the  the lines  
 
Q: The train tracks.
 
A: The tracks are different. 
 
Q: Right.
 
A: So you have to  we find  find
 a  a little shul. There was a few  
 
Q: Old.
 
A: Yeah. A few little, old yids. We are not 
in  it was only a few days.  It was upper 
ground and das. You have to know that you 
have to be very, very careful. The En 
Kavaday here, like in Moscow. They still have
 their hand over Po
land. And that's, oh, 
you see this.  So they  ordered us 10 days th ere. And th en it was the Jewish organization, 
Bricha (ph) escape, it is called, an d 
they put it over to 
go  to go th rough 
Czech  Czechoslovakia, to  to Austria, no? 
After 10 days. But we  we  we saw it. We 
were going from  from Pemishen to
  to the other side, to the 
border, when  we went to  to 
Austria, to when  when the 
Po lish codivar thro wing stones on the  on the train. It's very 
against  against Russia, but they couldn't   c
ouldn't see the Jews. They take  they take all 
our goods from Poland and they  
send us, the Jewish. That 's 
what they said, nu? See? 
 
Q: And at that time you were beginning to  
understand and hearing mo re stories about 
what occurred?
 
A: Oh, yeah. 
 
Q: Now, you're  you're going to  Poland and 
it's clear to you 
what had happened. 
 
A: In this time we knew already. Because it 
was already  before we left Russia, it was 
already known. It was already known. Peop
le knew already what  wh at was going on 
already. 
 
Q: And then  after, okay, you were
 in Austria, you went wh ere?
 
A: We come in  in ViennA: In Vienna we we
re for one month. And there our people  it's 
a lot  a lot of Polish Jews, 
Polish Yiddin, but Lubavitcha 
what escaped from Russia then, 
to contact the Lubavitcha Rebbe. Nu? And 
the Lubavitcha Rebbetold everybody what 
they have to look for, for Israel, for Canada
, for America and this, you see? My family, 
for example, when we wrote to
 the Lubavitcha Rebbe, a letter, nu, and got an  answer in 
ViennA: It was  Vienna was partaged 
(sic), parted four  four  four  
 
Q: Four sections.
 

A:  parted. Four sections, yes. American, Fr
ench, Ru ssia and  and English. And we were 
in the American sectio n. And from there, wr
iting to the Rebbe. One 
month we stayed in 
ViennA: Before the American UNRAA, that
's the UN  the UNRRA, they put every 
people in another  another  DP loggers, DP ca
mps. So we wrote a letter to the Lubavitcha 
Rebbe. And the Lubavitcha Rebbe thought befo
re  before the war it was a question that 
my family has to go to Aust
raliA: So, the Lubavitcha Rebbe
, in the first letter, where 
he  good wishes for coming 
out from Russia and escaping Ru ssia and this. And he said, 
your family, that were with you in contact 
from Australia is still th
ere. And it's worthful 
to start again about papers to
 go to AustraliA: Okay. And th
en after the one month, you 
go in  a  the DP camp in Austria for a half a year, about six month. And th en they  come 
to  the Lubavitch  in  in 
the meantime the Lubavitcha Rebbe
 found an office in Paris 
special for help for the  for the refugees, from the Lubavitch 
 mostly for the Lubavitcha 
community that was coming. And  and the direct
or of this  of this office, he took  he 
made  mad e  he spoke about papers for  fo
r the Lubavitcha people  people from our  from 
our camp to come to  to Paris. And that wa
s in May, in  May, 1947, that we came a  a 

group of 35 families, the first group in  Paris.
 And it  it doesn't  want it. French doesn 't 
want people, too mu ch refugees, to have ther
e. But it  it called that
 we are going through 
to another  I don't remember exact to which  
to wh ich country . I have
 somewhere the  still 
even the visA: Okay. Bu
t it  it has to be to stay there a month, two months, till the other 
papers were done for us. Still we stay there 
a lot more and their fa
milies prepare to go to 
Israel. In Israel is a very bi
g community. Now it's  still  is 
a few  a few villages for Chabad 
and now also Chab ad with sp
ecial LubavitchA:  And this 
all come from  through to 
France, the Lubavitcha Rebbe send there before
 the Rebbe, before his fatherinlaw. And 

we come to  to Paris.  And I  I  like I say, 
the Rebbe said that it's

years in this time. H e asked me to help

 something like this. 
In  mostly, on the 
Lubavitcha group co ming from Ru ssia, were in

I started with him. And my family, in meantime

I told him, all my chaverim are here and I 
wanted to go back to

A: Yes. Yes. Yes. It w as all kinds of this. All kinds  
 
Q: Paris was a stopping point?
 
A: Yes.

the first time, when I wrote to 
the Rebbe that I  that  the Ra

ffice, Rabbi answered me a very nice letter, 
okay, I was a bucher of over 20 years old, a

help him, HaSh em would help  you, mit us. When  they  come, I write the Rebbe, now th e 
yeshiva is here and I would like to go back 
to the yeshivA: And th
e Rebbe answ ered me, 
a kotzin letter, not  not a longer letter like be
fore, the whole  the whole goal of learning 
Torah with Talmud is to know ho
w to turn   to do a good thing fo r another Yid. You have 
to work to help in
 the office that's all and HaSh
em will help you. And there.  
 

So my whole family was work
ing about going to AustraliA: 
And I stayed in Paris. And 
then I  from  about  about a year later, I marrie
d there. And I continued to work all the  all 
the time in  in the Lu
bavitcha office there. 
 
Q: How long were you in Paris?
 
A: Twen tyfive years. 
 
Q: Twentyfive years in Paris?
 
A: Thirtyfive years. From '47 to '72. The fa
mily things, my first wife, La Hasholem, Olah 
V'Shalom, got to leave us, with this Rebbe
 says coming, this 
Rebbe already, and I 
continued to work here till a
bout 10 years ago, something like this, I was all w o rking fo r 
the office in a  in Paris. That's it. 
 
Q: So Paris became a point where all your fri
ends, your brothers, 
in this underground 
yeshiva, they came from Poke
y? A lot of them were 
 
A: Yes. Yes. Yes. 
 
Q: Perhap s we can go to that photograph right now, Mr. Vilchansky. 
 
A: Okay . 
 
Q: If you could just identify some of the peop
le in this photograph 
from this underground 
yeshiva and tell us who the teachers were, w h er
e you are again. I think we have a better 
viewpoint right now of this.
 
A: Okay . Co ming  coming to Paris, nothing
 now, Paris is very, very  very big 
Lubavitcher community. Yo ung people, young
  young generation. Bu t a very  it's 
very  there is five big schools what have 
about  about 2,000 kids
, Lubavitcher schools. 
 
Q: Huh.
 
A: That's in Paris and around Paris. And syna
gogues for Lubavitch, 
special synagogues in 
towns. It all started from our office, a roun
d little office. It was printed things mit us 
coming here. As I say, that is in the City of
 Vedicu, very  known Yiddish and das. And, as 
I told you, here is  here it says undergro
und religious academy  underground religious 
academy in the City of Vedicu
. And here is  no 
 no date. No date. 
Nothing down here.
 
Here we are the  the students, to say  say lik
e this. Here I am. This is  I am here. And I 
was  in this time, I was the youngest one of 
this whole group. And wh en this  that was 
taking th is photograph, I was  I was teves  
13 years and three months. Thirteen years and 
three months. And it was in December, 1937. 
We were sitting in a little shul, in a little 
shul. That's  the guardian of the shul. We were
 sitting in the basement, but not a basement.  
It's a cave. We were sitting all together with
 our teacher. That's our teacher. He came 

from BelarusiA: And he knew  
everybody knew that this ve
ry, very dangerous to learn 
with kids, when  this Soviet government 
has to learn communism. And th at's his 
contribution.  Contribution. But th at was 
the goal of  of giving over to the coming 
generation. And that was the  the mission with
 the Lubavitcha Rebbe gave when a  when  
he left Russia: Not to leave the religion to 
go out. And it has to go
 do without thinking 
about themself.  
 
That's  in  in the guardian. Th
at's  that's  this one is now
 in an old ag e home here in 
Brooklyn. This one is down in 
Brooklyn still. And  and that's 
all what's  wh
at's  what's 
left from th is  from this ph
otography. And that 's it. 
 
Q: It's a very interesting photograph.
 
A: Nu. 
 
Q: Very special photograph.
 
A: How come? Because now, in th is time, you ca
n  you can go there. They find out the 
whole  the whole  the whole  the whole tik
, nu? The whole  nu  
the whole papers from 
there, what was going on, the whole in
terrogations mit all these things. Nu? 
 
Q: I'm sure in the archiv
es somewhere, of course. 
 
A: Sure. Bu t  but now they give it out. They give
 it out. It's one of mine  mine  the son of 
this one, you  you  you  he went to RussiA:
 And th is one, the son 
of him. And he found 
out this papers and he made 
it and das it. Here it say.   
 
Q: Now, Mr. Wilschanski, one last question.
 And so much of your experience during th e 
war was around this group of people, a very
, very important story for you. And just 
taking from that and the  in the larger experien
ce, what in  in your  your sense, in your 
spirit, what message would you want to pass on 
to the younger generation in that kind of 
Hashkafic message to future 
generations, what happened to you and your fami ly, what 
are the  if I can put it in that way, wh
at are the lessons from your experience?
 
A: I see that the one thing th
at helped us to go
 through all this difficult times, for us, 
us  us youths, us ki
ds, and then  with us young boys, a
nd later, is because we were very, 
very strong with the way that the older gene
ration made it for us. All the prescriptions, I 
say, the terror, the rebbeshte, the Rebbe, Lu
bavitcha Rebbe, was always holding us in 
das  in the  in the hardest time
s. It was the only  the only wi
sh, that once it will come that 
we can be together and practice our religi
on openly  without any persecutions, without 
any difficulties. And that's it. 
That's what holded us. And 
when you  we came in a free 
land.  It's much difficult  
more difficult than it was there to see you. Because 
you  you  you know how the Talmud say, th
e eyes see and the heart want it. There 
you  you know that you can't go left or right
. You have to go in the right way, in the 

middle way. And that has the younger genera
tion  generation to lo ok and to learn from 
the older ones. We learned this from before 
us. Say later I'm not too mu ch learn from us 
but still, they can look  it was every generation 
has to look for the other. And, most of all, 
we have  we have wh ere to go. We have an 
open way, a very, very
 wide way and a good 
way. And that what holded us
 for the thousands of years a
nd that's what hold  us now. 
And that's the biggest miracle in the world. 
The Rabbi gezucht, you 
wanna make revenge, 
the Yiddish word from Hitler, go in
 the Jewish  in Jewish wa
y; that will be the biggest 
vengeance, zestas (ph), against H
itler, a yemach shemo v'zechrai. I have a  an anichle.  
And he's now in   in Milana, in das. And th er
e in Milana a family is a man and a wife and 
an aunt. That's a family. Not us.  And he, 
Baruch HaShem, have four kinderlach. Then 
maybe he got three. And he come in tram  trai
n. Come here, kinderlach. No, tati, tati, tati, 
tati. In Italiano, "Lady, nu, th
at's  all what you have? That's  
it? Yes? And you  you plan to 
have more"? "Yeah." "How mu
ch?  How much?" Das. "Six
 million," he told her. And 
that's all your  your fault. Yi
ddin doffin nissin, doffin gein in 
de richten de vag. And that 
will be the biggest, the biggest revenge agai
nst our enemies. And, 
Zecher, with HaShem 
help, that we will be the victorious. We will  das, das.
 
Q: Thank you very much, Mr. 
Wilschanski. Thank you very mu ch fo r your time today.
 
A: Thank you, Mr. Lustagazaler.
