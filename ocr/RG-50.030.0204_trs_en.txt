HENRY SCHMELZER 
January 12, 1990 
 
A:  ...that's a small place, small town...uh...near wh
at was at that time before the first world 
war...uh...the Austrian/Russian boarder becau
se that part of Poland was...uh...in the 
Austria...Austria...I think they called it Aust
ria/Hungarian empire. 
Austria/Hungarian I 
don't know how...how you would say that in 
English really. Uh...A
nd the grandparents 
also came from very close to that place. They lived there til the outbr
eak of the first world 
war, 1914, when my fat her was indoctri
nated into the Austrian Army and 
Mother...uh...who at that time was pregnant with
 my older sister, L
eah and we called her 
Toni...uh...fled from that area...took her 
mother along ﬂby the name  of Freda 
and...uh...fled to Vienna. My ol
dest sister was born on the way in Hungary. Uh...Ever 
since then until they had to escape from 
Vienna after the Nazis came in in 1938,...uh... we 
lived...we lived in Vienna. As a ma t t er of fact
, as far as I know we lived in the same  
house until the last 2 
or3 months of 1938. 
 

Q: Okay. Tell me ...uh...ple a se a little bit about 
your father's occupation. What did he do? 
 

A:  After my fa ther was demobilized
 from the army ...uh...he... uh... built up a...uh... wine 
business and over a period of 20 years he built 
it into a very substantial wi ne wholesale 
business. Uh...finally, we had...uh...large cellars in
 the...I think it was in the 18th District 
in ﬂI....I remember the place very well. It is 
a magnificent large court yard with chestnut  

trees...uh...three offices...uh...and extensive underg
round cellars. At least I was very 
impressive by the fact that they were...uh....uh...ba
rrels of wine higher than I was, which 
wasn't  very difficult. I wa sn't  very tall at 
the time , but they were about the height of a 
ma n. And...uh...there we re rows and rows of
 them. And there was an escalator going 
down...uh...along which I guess they were transfe
rring the barrels into
 bottles and so on 
and so forth. And he supplied ma inly restaura
nts and hotels. Some  of
 the wine we also 
imported from other countries, like Yugosla
via and I expect Hungary and so on. Uh...   
 

Q: You as a child! Tell me  a little bit 
about your childhood. Did you 
go to school?  Did you 
have friends? 
 

A: Yes. We ll, uh...first of all, what I...I have 
to say some thing in gene
ral about the nature of 
my me mories. Uh...the Nazi period stretche
s across...uh...the landscape of my me mories 
of my mi nd almost like a Chinese war. You ca
n...there are chinks here and there. You can 
look through them. You can catch a glimpse of
 s o me  of the things that happened beyond 
the war...before it, but...uh...this...this huge wa
r has cast a long shadow, both backwards 
and forwards, and really domi nates the landsca
pe. But I do reme mber some  of the things. 
Uh...We  wer e  substantially a mi ddle class fam
ily. As I say, we always lived in the same  
house in which really means a street of front
 gardens. Each apartment house had little 

front gardens. I reme mb er vividly thes
e were beautiful gardens with...uh...flower 
beds...uh...carnations, forget me  naught, rose
s...uh...and huge lilies. This was lilies I 
believe . Uh...The house itself...uh...uh...was really properly built. You know, in...in 

Vienna, you had houses that were built 
for centuries...uh...marble and...and brass

and...and oak to us and so on and so forth, abso
lutely beautifully fi
tted out. Uh...At first 
we lived on the third floor and then we moved down stairs to a mezzanine, which is a 
kind of half floor. It's almost on the level of 
the second floor as they would call it here 
because the ground floor is called the first 
floor in...in...in America. Uh...We always had 

as far...as long as I reme mber it any way, live 
in ma ids. These were generally girls who 
came from the country and...uh...Mothe
r...uh... wa s a very...uh... friendly and 
compassionate person. She was always... alwa
ys busy in the house, ma inly on cooking 
which was at that time a task that...that took up a good part of the day. Uh...The house 

was sparkling. Uh...I was a bookworm. I reme
mber lying on my belly on the floor and 
seeing my reflection in the linoleum. Uh...I wa
s lost in books. Uh...But I also had friends 
out in the streets and...uh...us
ed to play...uh...kicking the ball around and playing with 
those little ma rbles which at that time were 
clay, glossy clay balls. As a ma tter of fact, 
some were glass, but I liked the clay bette
r because they were so beautifully colored. 
Uh...I do reme mber vividly. Now before...before 
I come to the elementary school, I want 
to say that there were two...uh...fac ts that I vividl
y recall. First of all, I had a rather strict 
father. And that was very much in accordan
ce with the fashion of the times. These were 
patriotic figures. And I loved him ve ry much. I reme mber the intense joy that I had when 

I heard the... his key grating 
in the lock. I knew it was my fat her's  key. And I knew more 
or less what time he would come home. Moth
er was a very affectionate woma n. I am 
afraid that she...uh...she spoiled me . She wa
s over-protective. She was always hovering 
over me  when I was eating. The side effect, of
 course, was that I became  the worst eater 
in Europe. I mean it just came to a point that
 I couldn't even look at a cup of coffee or 
milk or whatever and not feel sick. I was a ve
ry, very bad eater. Yal. So that...that...that 
was...that wa s a strong me mory. Uh...Some
how...uh...I was very much of a dreamer. 
Books were my world of escape. And I ma na
ged to enter this wo
rld and close the door 
behind me and live in it for a long time. Ele m
ent a ry school wa s just around the corner. 
Uh...We ll around the corner. It was in a part
 of the street call
ed, oddly enough, means 
beautiful street. It wasn't  nothing very beau
tiful about that street, but the elementary 
school was called at the time . And I r e me mb
er the first...I was a person...uh...not very 
independent, probably as a result of the kind of
 education of the upbringing. As I said, I 
was over-protected, and...uh...it was difficult for me
 to separate myself from home and go 
to school in the first place. But...uh...I reme
mber vividly on one of the first days, the 
principal of the school, I reme mber the name
 of Pakoni lifted me  on to his knee and I can 
see his friendly face. He was a person of 
Czech extraction, I belie
ve . Uh...so he spoke a 
perfect German. I suspect that he mi ght even 
have been born in Vienna. But, of course, 

you know, the Austrian empire at the time in
corporated...uh... No, it ha
d incorporated. At 
that time when I was born and Czechoslavaki
a was already an independent country. But 

before that it was part of the empire. U
h...So he took me  on his knee and he asked me  
whom I loved more, my mother or him. I was 
intensely embarrassed. I'm telling this story 
to show that...uh...uh...Vienna was a place of mi
xed emotions for me. Anti-Semitism was 

endemi c in Vienna but there were loving pers
ons, of course. There 
were individuals who 
and I did experience affection a
nd love from some  of the m. As
 a ma tter of fact, when he 
asked me  this question, the door opened and Moth
er came in. (Laughter) So that just adds 
to my e mbar r assment. (Laughter) I don'
t know how I wiggled out of that one. 
Subsequently, we had a...a teacher by the 
name  of Kanote. Uh...and...uh...she also singled 

me  out as...uh...I guess I am...I a m re ally sorry 
to say as one of her preferred students 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0204

because I don't like this whole business of
 really singling out anybody. I am today for 
instance Professor at Rutgers University
 and...uh...I am very much guided by...uh...ma ybe 
this experience and others that...uh...that I just
 like all my students. I like all the kids 
there. Uh...But in any case, she had...she had 
the Jewish pets and the Gentile pets. I was 
the Jewish. The Gentile was a fe llow by the name of who is the son of policeman. I 
reme mber all these things so..so..so vividly. 
Uh...The reason I me ntion this again was to 
show you a little bit of the atmosphere 
there. Uh...And I reme mber one occasion 
when...uh...she would some ti me s go out because I 
think that...uh...she had a bit of a flirt 
going with a...with another teacher by the name
 of Flashman in the class. And she asked 
me  to monit or the class. And as soon as she 
left, the class broke out
 into some  kind of 
rowdy behavior and I immediately was able so
meho w to control that and what I learned 
about myself instinctively, you know, and I onl
y recall this on refl
ection now...was that 
in....in time s of tension and so, I seemed 
to have...to...to psychologically understand ways 
of controlling myself, 
of being in...in complete possession 
of myself and consequently of 
the situation and it was some thing that stood me  in good stead when the Nazis came in. 

Uh...   
 

Q: Let's talk about that .   

 

A:  Right...Wel l..   

 

Q: When the Nazis came  in.   

 

A: Yes. At that time...uh...that was, of cour
se, I believe...uh... the date was the 11th of 
March, 1938. And...uh...We had at that time  a 
live-in maid by the name of  Fritzi 
Shumberger. The reason I me ntion her was she di
d play a little bit of
 a role afterwards 
and also she had a little emble m on her lape
l. It was . It was...uh...in the shape of a boot, 
and subsequently we learned that it was the 
emblem of the leading Nazis. I say illegal 
because before the Nazis ma rched in, the Nazi
 party was not legal in Austria. However, 
personally, she was not...uh...hostile to us and I 
don't think that she behaved badly when 
all is said and done. Uh...I do reme mber the sp
eech of Shoosnick who was at that time 
Chancellor, ﬂ Chancellor.  
 

Q: Where were you?   

 

A: I was...I was in that apartment...in our ap
artment in 186 204. That was the fi rst apartme nt 
on the left side...uh...as you came into the house 
and stepped up quite a number of steps. 
Uh...And I listed to...uh...his speech and do...do reca
ll...uh...some of the words he said. I 
believe he said  To the death with red, white 
red, which is the color 
of the Austrian flag. 
Red, white, red. Uh...At least my me mory tells me
 that he said the things that he said. 
And...uh...Fritzi Shumbe rger, that ma id, and my 
brother next to me  (clearing throat) 
Excuse me . Guess I'll have to drink some thing.  
 

Q: That's  fine.  

 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0204

A:  (Drinking water) Uh...My br
other Leo. He was the next ol
dest. I was the youngest in a 
fa mily of four which was also was a kind of
 situation that...uh...had me
 on my guard most 
of the time. And...and what separated me  from t h
e next one was a period of 6 years, very 
substantial. But the other th
ree...uh...were only separated in 
terms of 2 years and there 
was... So really there were two fa milies. It was 
they and I. I always re
garded myself as  an 
outsider and I expect it was because of that
 large separation of time. Anyway, Leo was 
there and Fritzi and she said some thing, 
"Oh wonderful and so on and so forth." 
Uh...Because obviously, I think she was going 
out with some body who was a Nazi and 
they...they were very joyful 
about Hitler comi ng in. As a ma tter of fact, many Austrians 
were....uh... 
 
Q: Excuse me . I'm confused. Who was joyful.  

 

A: Fritzi Shumberger, our... our ma id was very joyful about it and ma
ny Austrians were. In 
any case...uh...and my brother rema rked...he ma de some  kind of...uh...negative rema rk 

about it, saying that...uh...,you know, there ma y 
not be that much reason to be happy. 
I...In any case...I do...I do reme mber that. I al
so reme mber the next
 day looking out. First 
of all, there were...there were
 bombe rs going...coming overhead. Hugh, 
hugh...uh...machines, droning and very low, almost
...uh...scraping the...the...the tops...the 
tops of the houses. Black, black planes. They 
looked black to me  or
 maybe that's just  a 
psychological me mory. Uh...And every house wa s dr
aped with a spastic of flags. Every 

house! And these were hugh flags. I am talk
ing about apartment houses, fi ve floors. And 
these were flags that...that went from the roof
 right almost down to the...to the sidewalk 
and I should imagine that...uh...there was a 
very active, highly organized Nazi 
underground move me nt. And they distributed a
ll these these flags over night. Also, there 
were ma ny Nazis in all the houses. There wa s a substantial proporti
on of Austrians and 
Nazis. Austria has always...uh... ma n a ged to portr
ay itself only as the victim and I have to 
say most e mphatically...and I don't want to be
 unjust to the ma ny peopl e in Austria who 
were good people and kind people...but there wasa large population of 
haters in Austria. 
And I don't think there was a single country 
in the world that embraced Hitler so 

fervently as the Austrian nation. And those of
 us who were there know it, experienced it. 
Uh...I do reme mber that...uh...somehow or other I 
ma naged to either to allow my mot her 
to go out or slip...I probably 
slipped out. And I went pretty
 far afield because I found 
myself...uh...and this was probably not on the fi
rst week. It wa s probably some  weeks 
after the entry. But it was a time 
when...when Hitler...uh...was...uh...uh...going around in 
a procession. I reme mbe r  him...I remember 
hi m s t anding in a motor car, standing upright. 
It was an open...uh... car. And the sidewalks were
 thronged with people. I mean there was 
just one ma ss of people all waving and s
houting and...and...and jubilant. Uh...There was 
an ecstasy of joy. And I was standing ther
e very quietly observing this. Uh...At that 
time...uh...people who knew you before suddenly 
didn't know you. (Clearing throat) In 
our apartme nt house, we had...uh...the re were quite a number of Jewish families in our 

apartment house. Uh...There were not many Ge ntile families, but I think... There were 

probably...it was probably half half. There mi ght
 have been three or four...of two I know 
definitely that they were Nazis. Uh...One was called Garla, and he 
will appear later on 
because he tried to blackmail my father a
nd caused his arrest. Uh...and the other one wa s 
Sargi, and this Sargi, you know, there was this
 special story there be
cause they are...there 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0204

was daughter and two sons. The two sons ha
d been friends of my brothers. But the 
friendship, I think had already more or 
less fizzled out...uh...uh...ma ybe a year or two 
before the Nazis came , but...uh...actually en
tered, but obviously, it was probably on the 
side of their becomi ng Nazis. One was cal
led Franz and the ot her Willi. Willi Sargi 
became an SS man, and Franz Sargi became 
an SR ma n. Uh...And it's...they...they never 
personally undertook any action against us, th
ese people. And as a ma tter of fact, the 
daughter...I don't know her name ...who was working...uh...as probably some  secretary in 
the police headquarters, local
 police headquarters, was helpful to my mother.  
 

Q: How?    

 

A: I don't recall the exact circumstances. I 
think it probably was...it mi ght have been 
connected with the arrest of 
my father. I am going to talk 
about it a little later on. But I 
know that my mother went...uh...to her and I seem
 to reme mber that when she came back 
that she said some  nice things about...a
bout her. But I don't reme mber the exact 
circumstances. I wasn't  even told exactly wh
at happened at that ti
me . Uh...If I can stop a 
mome nt here because I have a sense th
at there was something happening...   
 

Q: Can you hold...hold the tape a mi nute?  Is that
 what you what you would like to do.  H  
 

A: Yal. 

 

Q: Can you stop the tape a mi nute. Tell me  when it's on Bonnie. Okay.   

 

A:  One of the things that...that I reme
mber vividly...uh...was, of
 course, the fact 
that...uh...shortly after...uh...the annexation...uh...we
 had to stay there. And there was 
a...some obvious peculiar about celebrating fe
stival of freedom of liberation. And I do 

reme mber my father sitting there at the ta
ble and saying...uh...that he
 really didn't have 
the heart to do it. But we  decided that we
 do it anyway. And I...I am sure it was the 
hardest and most difficult that we ever had. 
Just because it is a festival of liberation, 
and...uh...I don't need to tell you how we feltat that time . Uh...One of the...I had 

mentioned...I had mentioned...uh...Incidently I mentioned Willi Sargi, and I just want to 

add to this that...and it's strange how someti mes little things...uh...become me mories 

that...that stand out way and beyond the signif
icance. Because my...my sister, Leah, and 
we actually always called her Toni for some  r
eason so I am going to refer to her as Toni. 
Uh...She had ma naged to blot out most of the 
things that happened at the time, but one 

thing she...she reme mbe r s vividly and she's to
ld me  about it two or three time s. I me an 
whenever she me ntions that, I can feel it...t
he strong emotions tied up with it, and it's a 

little thing. She reme mb ers herself walking 
into the house one day and Willi Sargi, 
that...that fellow who had been friends of
...uh...my fa mily, of my brothers and possibly 
her too, was walking ahead and he opened the doo
r and he closed it right in her face. It's 
such a little thing, but 
it will live with her as long as she lives. And so I sa y me mories are 
strange things because so many more horre
ndous things happened afterwards. Uh...At 
that time, I was going to...the ﬂ Ł gymnasium
. That was a Jewish High School. A very, 
very good high school. One of the two best
 in Vienna. Uh...And they had a very 

select...uh...cadre of...uh... teachers. One of 
the m was a pretty woma n poe tist and...uh..., 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0204  
6 
 
of course, at that time, you know, the curricul
um and the standards of education are very 
high. That school closed its door in... afte
r I graduated...uh... in 1938. 
It closed its door 
for good for over 50 years. I think they only re
cently reopened again, last year or so I 
think I've heard. And I reme mber that
...uh...when we...uh... left...uh.. on the last day of 
school...uh...and there was a group of boys waitin
g outside to beat us up, but...uh...that 
was...that wa s the gymnasium. Uh...I had two 
brothers...uh...the oldest by the name  of 
Gabe. He left for the United States...uh... ear
ly in 1938. He mi ssed most of the...uh... Nazi 
period.  I think he left...uh...uh...i
n the early summer, late spring or early summer.  
 
Q:  How did he get out? 

 

A: We have...a part of my mother's fa mily
 is Ame r ican...had settled in America...uh...a 
generation or two ago. And they sent us a
ffidavits and...uh...Gabe was the first one able 
to ma ke use of it. So he went straight ...uh...you know, as a important little passenger on 

the ship, he could close the door and lu
ckily he missed...uh... most of the terrible 
things...uh...that happened afterwards.  
 

Q: Why did the rest of you not go with him?   

 

A: Well, ...uh...it took time. Affidavits, y
ou know, affidavits, the processing and 
everything...uh...wasn't such a simple and easy matter. It took...uh...it took father almost a 

year...uh...to get out...uh...for instance. Uh...L
eo...Leo was the second one who left, 

but...but his...uh...exodus was fraught with difficulti
es. In the first place, in summer he 
tried to escape over the border 
into France and he went with
 a friend by the name  of . 
And...uh...he was caught by the French police 
and returned. And...uh...since...since my 
brother was...he was a very handsome fello
w and quite a personality I would say...uh... 
He had no difficulty with the German borde
r police and there were some  SR SS me n 
there. Uh...He had no problem whatsoever and 
they just let him go. Yal. And he returned 
to Vienna. And I...I still reme mber him co
mi ng up the street. I happened to be outside, 
and he was tanned and he...he...he looked so
 wonderful, like some body who came from 
the mountain already or some thing like th
at. Uh...Shortly after 
that, he...uh...he went 
again. He escaped by Italy and by illegal ship...uh...to Palestine. So he got into Palestine, 

it was probably late summer of 1938, and 
when war broke out...uh... early in 1940 in 
Germany he  volunteered. And he fo
ught through all the campaigns...uh...so...uh...in 

North Africa and...uh... practically th
e whole length of Italy.  
 

Q: With which army?  

 

A: He was...uh...with the British army, the RASC. I 
think he was first in the Palestine corps. 
There was...there was, in fact,...he was involve
d in a very significant rescue mi ssion of 
Jews...uh...in northern Italy who were held 
captive by the Gestapo and...uh...the group 
of...uh...Jewish soldiers...uh... I don't know that 
they were in command of t he whole 
group or only of that particular transport of
 that particular truck...uh...crossed-through the 

German bor der at the time and there was only a 
local armi stice, a local armi stice between 
the commanders and the Germans were still 
arme d. And they went right up to that 

particular headquarter, and the Gestapo had fl
ed at that time . And they took all over a 100 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0204  
7 
 
Jews back to...to Rome . I have to say, however, that my brother told me  about this only 
once and that is when I saw him for the first time in 1953. Uh...That is...uh... practically 

15 years after...uh...the Nazi invasion or Nazi 
annexation out of Austria. And we had a 
long talk in Israel. He told me  once about
 it and never talked about it again and...uh...now 
that I have a chance, I am going to try to ge
t historical documentation because my brother 
was...uh... a rather quiet and extreme l y restra
ined sort of person and he...he's  never 
me ntioned it again. And I think it was a si
gnificant...was a very 
significant...uh... episode. 
As a ma tter of fact he told me  that when
 they came  back to Rome , he formed...uh... the 
American Army and said that he inst ructi
ons from British Headquarters that here was a 
group of people who had to be taken care of
 and...uh...they...they were obviously people 
in very poor condition of health. Yal. So he
 surrended them...he surrended them to...to the 
Americans and he said to them when...when 
they first arrived and the Jews saw them, 
some thing fell underneath and said they were
 angels.  ....school. My parents registered 
me  in a...in a training course for carpenters. 
There were a number of
 different (clearing 
throat) vocational courses being given under th
e auspices of...uh...the Coltis Commander, 
which was the Jewish...uh...uh...organization, the Or
ganization of Jewry in Vienna. And I 
guess the idea was (a) since I woul
d have to leave and they tr
ied to send me  out as early 
possible because obviously every day was..uh...I 
was threatened there...uh...to get me  out 
of har m's way, to get me  away from the ap
ar tment which was a trap and also to gi ve 
some  qualifications, some sort of anothe
r. And...uh... I reme mber...and I am going a little 

ahead and I will afterwards go backward, but 
I am going a little ahead of time because I 
reme mber on the day of the Kristallnacht 
which I believed was the 9th to the 11th of 
Nove mber, 1938. I was in that carpentry work
shop and there was a call on the telephone 
and the ma nager of the shop...uh... went to the ph
one and listened very seriously and then 
he turned to us and said, "There is so
me action on the way and you will be safer at 
home ." I am going to talk abut this in deta
il a little later on because there was lots of 
things that happened in between. And I want
 to talk about them now. Uh...First of 

all,...uh...a... a number of times...uh...the Nazis came  to our place, to our apartment. They 

came to our apartment. They weren't exactly 
break-ins, but they weren't exactly visits 
either because these people came and..uh... they
 didn't bother to ring the bell or  knock on 
the door. They...they generally beat on the door 
with their boats so we knew exactly what 
kind of gentleme n were waiting out there. 
 

Q:  Do you need some  water?    

 

A:  Yes. Please.   

 

Q: I must really sound very hoarse here. 

 

A: That's fine. Take your 
time. Take some  water.  

 

Q: Uh...I reme mber a number of these occasions. 
I think I ha ppened to have been present at 
practically every one of them cause I was 
mostly at home except when I was in that  

carpent ry workshop later on. Uh...On oneoccasion they came and...uh...they asked for 

my father. And my father was a very sick 
ma n at that time . At the sight of what 
happened...uh...Of course, as I said, the busin
ess was Aryonized. He lost the business 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0204  
8 
 
and, consequently, in his mi nd he lost the...uh...
the very reason for existence. He lost the 
structure of his life. Uh...He...uh...became so sick
 that every da y he had attacks that he 
simply...uh... fell unconscious. He became unconsc
ious. I reme mber he did the blood 
drained from his face. His face became  ashe
n. He sank back and for about 10, 15 minutes 
he was as if dead. And then he always r
ecovered. And that happened day after day, day 
after day, day after day. Yal. You can imagin
e what kind of impact it had on me . At least 
it's difficult to imagine, really difficult to im
agine. Uh...I later on, I 
subsequently learned 
(clearing throat) fr om a sister  that  these 
were epileptic attacks. He had developed 
epilepsy. I didn't even know that at the tim
e. Uh...his...hair, which had always been 
blond, turned gray in a week. So, and he had 
alwa ys had heart trouble and so on. So when 
the Nazis came  on one occasions, this was 
, I heard my mother say, "Why don't you take 

me . He 's a...he's a very sick ma n. He has 
a very sick heart. Why don't you take me  
instead? " And the Nazi looked at her. Ther
e were two of them. 
And one said, you know, 
"Lock your door. We  are going to say that
 nobody is home. And don't open for anybody." 
And they left. On another occas
ion, and I am mentioning the littl
e...the little vi
sit at first. 
On another occasion...uh...they came and they as
ked for...if there were any ma les around, 

any me n. I was the only one.  And...uh...I always
 looked about 5 years younger. That was 
as a result of eating so badly I guess. A
nd it was really what saved me  from the 
concentration camp. (Cl earing throat) Because
 he looked at me  and he thought I was 
about 10, and I was really 14. (Laughter) He di
dn't  even bother to say anything. He just 

turned around. It's  like...uh...thr
owing a little fish back, you know, and left. That was the 

second visit. The third one, and I don't know 
whether I have the order correctly because 
me mories are strange. You reme mbe r  things
 vividly, but you don't always reme mber the 
order in which they happened. Uh...About at 
least 3 or 4, this SR man ca me  to our 
apartment in  and I remember at that time, 
this...this must have been before mi d-summer 

because I was still in school. I reme mber I wa
s in school because I had visited a friend by 
the name  of Amile Krueger. He was a genius 
in mathematics and I was excellent in Latin, 
the Classics and Literature, so we used to 
help each other. And I was visiting his place 
and came home  and as I knocked on the door, either the mo ment I knocked on the door or 

just a little before I hear d noises in the apar
tment and knew they were not noises from my 
fa mily. I still reme mber I was rooted by fear
, and I had an imme diate impulse for flight. 
But whether it was solidarity or fear or whatev
er  it was or the swiftn
ess with which things 
happen, I didn't turn...turn away, and the door 
opened and instead of my mother, there 
was this giant ma n. And I was pulled in some how...uh...and there was my father, mo ther 

and myself. My sister was married at the tim
e and she had a separate apartment, not too 
far from us. And there was Fritzi Shaumberger,
 our ma id, and they ma de us stand against 
the wall. I was in the  which is...uh...the...uh..the
 foyer, the lobby, youknow. It's  a sort of 
L shape, very long L shaped room. They ma de us  stand against the wall by the corner 

window and one of them shouted, Where's 
the gold?  Where've you hidden the gold?" 
These were very primitive people. Ya l. They
 mu st have thought we were Fort Knox or 
something. I mean, gold. I know my moth
er had a wedding ring, but...uh...hidden gold, 
buried it. Uh...My father said, "We have no gold."
 So they stood us against the wall. They 
took out their pistols and they
 put the pistol on our chest.
 It wa s father, mother and 
myself. And father said to them...and Fritz
i Shumberger, the mai
d, was standing in the 
doorway of the kitchen and watching... What 
could she do really?  And father said, "Why 
don't you shoot us? "  And I am quoting almost verbatim. He s a id, "I'd rather you shoot us 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0204  
9 
 
straight away than have this insult
 and...uh...indignity, you know, without end." And 
actually that...that...th
at...uh...brings up another me mory 
in my mi nd. They didn't shoot 
us. Uh...They...at that time apparently didn't ha
ve the authority to do that. Or possibly 
they were still after the gold and you can't  
get gold from dead Jews, whatever the case 
ma y be. And they took my father away. They
 took him to our business. At that time it 
was still in our possession in the di stri ct, and 
my brother, Le o, was still there at the time . 
And I reme mber Leo had some  money some whe r e on an inside pocket, but he said he had 
no money. You see we needed that m
oney desperately because...uh...there was no 
business anymore and we knew that without
 money, we won't  be able to get out. 
So...uh...they didn't find the money on him. We we
re always walking on a tight rope. Yal. 
Whether the arrested father at the time or 
not, I do not know. I know Father was arrested 
at least twice. But...uh...my mother
 and I were locked into the 
kitchen after they left. And 
they left this SR ma n to guard us. This
 ma rshall of people, you know, these heroic 
figures, the Aryonrosher...superman in th
eir imagination. I had learned to be 
contemptuous of anti-Semites and I will come  back to this...uh...afterwards, but in any 

case, I was a very, restless, impatient sort of 
person and I had inherited a little bit of the 
temper fr om my father. And all the time that
 temper was rising within me  and reme mb er 
I was a book wor m. It was never clear when I 
left the world of reality and walked over 
into a world of i magination. Yal. In the worl
d of imagination, I was just a I me an I...So 
eventually, I got so fed up, I got so angry in th
e kitchen I said to my 
mother, "I have to do 
home work and they prevent me  from doing the home work and I am going 

to...to...uh...take them to task over this." And I do
n't know if my mother
 tried to restrain 
me , but, you know, what could she do. I went 
out and I confronted this Nazi and said, 
"You know that I am supposed to do my 
homework. I am supposed to bring it in 

tomorrow a nd if I can't  do it because of you, you will come  with me  tomorrow and you 

will come  to the teacher. Yal. And you tell her 
whose responsible for this. Yal." He didn't  
know how to cope with this. And...and this is
 where my me mory ends. I really do not 
know what happened, you know. He didn't beat 
me up. That is for sure because I would 
have reme mbered that. Yal. But whether I 
was allowed to do the homework or whether 
they pushed me  inside again or what, I...I do 
not recall. That...that was one visit. Uh...Our 
flat...our apartment was...was broken in on a
nother occasion. We don't  know who did it. I 
should imagine it was done really by so-cal
led ﬂin courtŁ officials because...uh...the 
apartment was sealed by the Nazis. And...uh...  
 

Q:  What do you mean it was sealed.  

 

A: It was sealed. Sealed by Ge
stapos. We were not allowed to 
enter again. It was just  sealed. 
It was put under seal, lock and seal.  
 

Q: Where did you go to live.  

 

A: I...I...I'll tell you that. Proba
bly...Actually...we actually went to
 our sister. If my sister 
hadn't been there, well, I guess we still had a
...I still had a aunt. They had a very small 
apartment. But we...we lived with our sister
 for the...for the last 2 or 3 months...uh... 
Uh...What happened there was that I had...w
hatever money we had left...I don't know 
whether at that time  we had already lost th
e business or not, but in any case, there wa s 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0204  
10 
 
little business and people wouldn't pay us anyw
ay even if we supplied. Uh...So we had no 
money comi ng in and so we had a substant
ial business but you know as a businessman, 
we weren't that rich. We  had some  money left
 to pay for expenses to move out or what, 
but whatever money we had left was our lifel
ine for escape. And I had become  extremely 
adept at hiding things and at finding things
. And the reason why I had become  adept was 
that, as I told you, I was a book worm and I w
ould read through libraries. I mean literally 
shelf after shelf cause I reme mber my mother w
ould take me  to a worker's library in this, 
I believe they called them, you know. The Social Democrats built wonderful apartment 

buildings in Vienna. They...they become  qu
ite well renowned. And they had libraries 
there and health clin
ics and...uh...kindergarten and gardens insi
de. It was really a splendid 
world. Yal. And they had these libraries, and 
my mother would take me there and for me 
this was a paradise. And actually as I reme mber
, they were really little rooms, but the 
glorious thing was there was these bookcases 
and they were stacked with books from the 
floor to the ceiling and I knew that each book 
was a world. And it just entranced me . Yal. 
And I would read indiscrimi nately, but th
ey were mostly good books. They were...at 
home  also we had, our saloon was stacked. We  
ha d all the classics. 
At that time we had 
paperbacks also the crown books they were ca
lled. That was before the Pe nguins. And I 
knew all the classi cs and I knew the Russians and the French, the dossiers and all these 

people. But my mother used to hide books from
 me that were classics even because they 
were too serious. For instance,...uh...and what an
 innocent world it was at the time , for  
instance...uh...and , Crime and Punishme nt. I a m 
me ntioning this because it later on pl ays 
actually a role. However, there was no pl
ace they could hide a 
book that I didn't find. 
And...uh...the most peculiar pl ace that my mother found was the stove pi pe , you know, in 

the saloon and I found that t
oo because I always...I put my
self in her place. Now 
where...where would I hide some thing. A book...a book isn't such a small object you see. 

So I became extremely skilled in nosing out things, where they mi ght be hi dden, and 
hiding things. And I was the person cons
equently selected...you see how negative 
qualities become  virtues in a world that's 
gone crazy...to hide whatever money we had 
left. And what I did, and that
 was just before our apartm
ent was ransacked and sealed, 
was...uh...we had these brass beds which 
had hollow legs and you could unscrew 
the...uh...the wheels. So I stuffed some  money 
up there in the legs
 and then we had 
curtain rods that were also br
ass. Hugh things! And I stuffe
d some  money there. Actually, 
you could only get them out with very, very
 long thin stick. Ya l. The Nazis, however, 
who were never book worms, never learne
d...uh...to learn to look..to look for things 
(laughter), you know, in those little hollow hiding places. And they never found the 
money. Now, then the apartment, after 
the apartment was sealed, and we were 
ordered...and we had no money... Ya l. We  were
 literally penniless. So one day, Mother 
took me  to the Gestapo headquarters...Central
 City...It was in the 
hotel. I forgotten the 
name  of the hotel. And I want to explain to
 you exactly what happened because I vividly 
reme mber every mo me nt of it. And, of cour
se, she had me  by the arm, you know, and we 
walked in and there was this...this sple
ndid lobby. And there were people standing 
around. I don't whether they wore uniforms or no
t, but there were people in there. It was 
a lovely pl ace, and there was a spiral staircase 
to the right and at the foot of the staircase 
was a soldier. I believe he was a soldier a
nd not a SR ma n. He  mi ght have been a SR 
man, but I seemed to reme mber he was a sold
ier. (Clearing throat) Sorry. And he had a 
rifle there with a bayonet, a nake
d bayonet planted in...uh...the...uh...what you call 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0204  
11 
 
that? ...the...uh... on top of the ri
fle planted there. And as we came in, he jumped mother 
and he saw a woma n wi th...with a child there 
and he imme di ately decided we'r e Jewish 
and he shot at some thing like . They used th
is expression. It's like 
is like sow. It's  a 
fe ma le pig, you know. And they combined it wit
h...with the term Jew. And for them that 
was the way to call us. And he...he...he advanced the rifle into a ready position and that's 
another heroic measure...here's a woma n with
 a child. Yal. And he ma de some  kind of 
threatening move me nt, and my mother brushed 
by him as if he didn't exist. Yal. Totally 
ignored him.  And he was an attack dog who...w
ho had not been instructed how to deal 
with a situation like that. And this is what 
happened some ti me s in those situations. If you 
were really plucky or if you were de
sperate to the point that you didn't 
care...uh...someti mes you overwhelmed the m. Some times. But you had to have some  

presence in that control. As I said some thi
ng that I learned in school early. However, it 
didn't stand...it didn't help me  in this s
ituation because when we came in I was so 
embarrassed. It was, of course, a mi xture of emba rrassment and fear
, but I honestly think 
it was about 90 percent or 80 
percent embarrassment. I was 
a very shy youngster, and 
here everybody was looking at us. And I was pulli
ng at my mother's arms...let's get out of 
here, you know. I was so ashame d. Yal. Just to 
be in the center of 
attraction, even if it 
hadn't been for...even it had been for  purposes. 
But my mot her let me go. I ran out of the 
hotel, but I was sufficiently able to see her,
 to watch her go up the 
staircase. We ll, my 
mother came out of this hotel with the ke
y to our apartment. You have seen her 

photograph. She was a very impressive pe
rson and some how when
 no ma tter who, like 
the Nazi, the SR ma n...the underling who ca
me , and who mus t  have had a spark of 
huma nity in his mi nd and who left without doi
ng any harm to us and even cautioned us to 
lock up and not open to anybody. And here...this 
Gestapo officials of high rank, because 
they were the officials in th
e headquarters and they gave her the keys. But they gave her 

the key for 24 hours...24 hours or 48 hours. I th
ink 24 hours. It was enough for us to go 
in, take the money out that we
 had there and so ma ke it possi
ble for us to survive. That 
was the second substantial visit. It wa s really
 not a visit. It was...uh...say...it was really a 
break-in to our apartment. Subsequently, of
 course, she returned the key. Uh...Now...Now 
I want to...to...to go back or to go forward 
rather to speak abou
t the Kristallnacht.  
 

Q: Okay. Could we hold it?  If you're mo ving to th
ere, we'r e about ready to change tapes, so 
let's do that at this point .  
 

A: Right. Okay. Good.   

 

Q: You can take some  water.   

 

A: Thank you.   

 

Q:  Okay. We 'r e back. You were going 
to take it up with Kristallnacht. 
 

A: Alright. Uh...Yal. Just before I go to Krista
llnacht , ther e's something really significant  I 
have to me ntion. As I said, Father...Fathe
r was a broken ma n because....uh...he had lost 
his business. Essentially, he had lost, in his ey
es, his role. His role 
was that of protector. 
And now he  couldn't protect us. Mother, on th
e other hand, had gained a role because she 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0204  
12 
 
had to do everything she had done before
 and mo re. And she was always...uh...a 
housewife, a house person. So Mother became st
ronger but Father just br oke. And Father 
wanted to die. He...he wanted...he wa nted...as a ma
tter of fac t , he really wanted that all of 
us should commit suicide. And...and not only, an
d as I told you befo
re, that he lost 
consciousness...uh...every day and it was really a 
death that he wished. He wanted us all 
to die. He wanted that all of us should co
mmit suicide. It was th
e only way out that...that 
he saw possible. And every time that a Jewi
sh family that we knew had chosen this 
path...had committed suicide... In one case I remember he wa s talking abut  the family that 
went out to the cemetery and they committed suicide at  the gr ave site, probably of their 

parents. He came home and he said, "Wha
t a wonderful thing these people did. We  
should do the same  thing." Uh...   
 

Q: How did your mother respond to that?    

 

A: My mother very quietly...uh...I...I...I don't ev
en reme mber her saying anything. She just 
didn't accept his advice. Yes. But all the time
 what had happened inside  of me  was in 
situations like this...uh...something grow
s up between you and your world, the world 

outside. It's...it's that wall that I talked a
bout before, which had started to build up and 
you can really only survive at a very, very 
significant price. A
nd the price is...uh...that 
you detach yourself from your emotions 
and when you lose your emotions...when you 
lose your connection with your feelin
g, you essentially become ...uh...an automa ted...you 
essentially become  a sort of person drai
ned of vitality because you don't want to 
experience what is happening around you, 
so you can't  experience anything. Uh...And 

once that happens...it isn't some thing...it's not
 like shoes you can put on and take off...and 
actually it some ti me s lasts in some  ways a li
fe time . Not in that horrendous for m, but I 
will expl ain to you later how I emerged 
from all this into England. But it 
certainly...uh...helps you escape and...uh... Unfo
rtunately, we didn't know. The world 
didn't know how to cope with this psychologi
cal situation at the time so they thought you 
got out of it. Let's forget it. And that is e
ssentially what happen, except you ma y forget it, 
but it doesn't forget you and...uh...it just goe
s on living within you. Alright. Uh...The 
Kristallnacht and its generally known 
that...uh...what triggered it was...uh...the 
assignation by a young Jewish boy...I th
ink his name  was...uh...Green...   
 

Q: Greenspan. 

 

A: Greenspan. Yal. Who had...uh....shot...uh... some  
German offi cial at the Paris...the 
Germany Embassy in Paris by the na me  of ﬂ Ł. Because...uh...they had...uh...I believe 

killed his parents. 
 

Q: Don't worry about that. What happe
ned...Where were you at Kristallnacht? 
 

A: Okay. Uh...I was on Kristallnacht, actually
 that day I was...I was in the carpentry 
workshop. And...uh...I me ntioned before the telephone call came so when the ma nager of 

the workshop took the call and turned to us and said, "Look. There is some thing going on 

in town. You'll be better off at home ." We
 knew i mmediately what...what is going to be. 

We packed our...our stuff and...uh...we...uh... we
nt...went home . I re me mber...I had 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0204  
13 
 
forgotten where this ...this carpentry workshop was, but I should imagine by the 
appearance of the...uh...the neighborhood because 
I was waiting for a train. I took a train, 
but I know what kind of...uh... streets we went 
through. Uh...It seemed to have been the 
inner city which is an unusual place fo
r a workshop because these were splendid 

buildings. And I reme mb er standing...you see the.
..the...the trains in Vienna had an open 
platform...uh...either at...at the rear end 
so you could easily jump on and off and you 
could be standing there. And I was standing al ong side. It was close to me. There was an 

elegant couple and, you know, in those times 
when people we re elegant, they were 
elegant. There was a very attractive lady and sh
e was dressed in a beau
tiful silk dr ess it 
seemed to me, and a gentleme n and she was looking at the newspaper and seeing 

some thing and she turned to the ma n and said, "Look at this terrible things they'r e doing 

to the Jews in Germany. Surely, this coul
dn't happen here." I reme mber those words 
because...uh...first of all, there are a lot of
... Really, the only words I remember from 
that...from that period actually spoken because
 within a few seconds or a few mi nutes or 
mome nts or very short time a fter that, we pa
ssed a side st reet. The 
train went on a side 
street  and there was this magnifi cent temple in fl ames. And there was a Jew in costume 

with a long beard. Obviously he mu st have 
been praying in the 
synagogue and he was 
running and there was a crowd running after 
him and he was like one of those you know, 
in the classic books that I was reading. Uh...w
ith a poem by Sheller about a Kraut chasing 
some thing or other. And you flash by. I mean
 the train, you know, how long does it take. 
It was just a. And it was an ironic comme
ntary on what that lady said...uh..to the ma n. I 
reme mber comi ng home, which was actually th
e apartment of my 
sister and...uh...there I 
knocked on the door and you must...and you mus t ...uh...not reme mber because you don't 

know of this, but bear in mi nd that these 
were heavy reinforced doors with not only 
ma ssive...uh...wood, but also not the kind of plyw
ood that is used now, but genuine oak 

or some thing like, but also...uh...uh...steel barsinside. There's a whole...there's a whole 
steel door inside. So these were fortresses. 
I don't know why they were fortresses because 
there were very few thefts ther
e. But nonetheless, at
 least before the Nazis, in which case 
these were really thefts, but...uh...these...these 
doors were difficult to break down. Wh en I 
came home  t hey very cautiously opened
 the door. My...I found there my...my...my 
mother, my sister and her baby. Her baby wa
s...uh...only about 2 months old at the time. 
Rose was born in August 1938. So I can...I can position this in time because I...she was 
born in August 1938. I left on the 18th of December 38. Of course, it's the Kristallnacht, 

11th of November. We ll, I knew that befo
re. So...uh...she was 2 months...2 months old. 
And Father wasn't  there. I believe he mu
st have been arrested. And...uh...my brother-in-
law had been arrested. My...my sister says
 that happened on the morning of the 
Kristallnacht, but at any rate
 I know that he was...uh...sent 
to Dachau and he was in 
Dachau in fact over...over half a year. Uh...H
ow he got out of it alive, but...uh..and he 
went through terrible time  there. In a
ny case, when I came home, something strange 
happened. I mean I was always the youngster,
 the kid and so on. And now I...I was the 
only ma n. And I don't know whether this is some
 genetics or the biology of relatives, I 
just...I...the diffident, the shy, the book wor m 
and so on, assume d control quite naturally 
and I said, "If some body come s, we won'
t open the door. We  just don't open." And 
this...well, my sister was always a pers
on...my sister was not a person who was very 

assertive. In any case, she would have taken 
a rather quiet role in
 the background. But my 
mother was a very courageous person. But I th
ink as a result of all 
that had happened...of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0204  
14 
 
what happene d to Father...of the fact that 
both of them were arrested, she became...she 
was very quiet and she just
 accepted...uh...my suggestion 
without any demurring. We ll, 
we didn't have to wait long. Shortly after, it
 was before lunch time, we heard these...uh... 
very well known...uh... boots beating on the door 
and they weren't just beating on the 
door, generally accompa nied by shouts...open up 
 this that and so on. We  didn't open. 
And I think probably...I have gone 
through some  different phases in my life, but this must 
have been one of them because...uh... we tiptoed into the kitchen and so as not to be seen 
from outside or so we were on the fifth 
floor, but the house was built around the court 
yard and you could have looked in from th
e opposite wing. So we had to stand pressed 
against the wall. And my sister had to put 
her hand on the mouth of the baby. It was a 2 
month old baby. And always be afraid that either
 she mi ght stifle her 
inadvertently or that 
the baby would cry. And here these me n we
re battering on the door and you know, with 
the jack boots you can subject 
a door to some  treatment and it went on, it seemed to me, 
for an eternity. And what went through 
my mi nd was the scene 
of  in Crime and 
Punishme nt.  was a criminal. Yal. But nonetheless, it was a scene of the mo st...and they 

were standi ng there in, I believe in the kitchen, after havi ng co mmitted the deed, and they 

hear some ...some steps going up and then the door 
rattling and he is af
raid that the lock 
mi ght...mi ght open up because...uh...this...uh...was
 just some ...some kind of...uh... what 

do you call it in English? It's...uh...we call it a..I
t wasn't ...it wasn't  locked with a key, but 

it was locked with some ...some kind of mechanical device.  
 

Q: Yal. I know what you mean.   

 

A: Uh...And that scene flashed through my mi nd 
because I was always living half in the 
book and half outside. And then we...and we could hear everything that wa s going on 

outside and then...uh...one ma n said to the other
...apparently, he was 
the leader of the 
group. He said to the other, "or whatever th
e name  was, Go down and fe tch a crow bar." 
And this fellow went down. And, of course
, our...way back...uh...was closed. We  couldn't 
open. They would have thrown us out the window. At that mome nt, the door from a 

neighboring apartment opened and there was 
a wo ma n... I had never spoken to her. 
Mother had never spoken to her. I don't know
 whether my daughter knew her. She was a 
Gentile obviously. And she said, "You know, I saw them go out about a hour ago. You're 

wasting your time"...or words to that effect. Y
ou could hear everything 
in that apartment. 
You could hear things through 
the door. And they went away. And in the afternoon, they 
came back. And, of course, I had said, "Look. 
They come  ba ck in the afternoon. We  open 
imme diately. I don't want to go through this ag
ain." Yal. So when they came , we opened 
straight away. But I, you know, my t e mper 
was...was sort of moving up, you know, again 
and I decided that I was going to sit at
...uh... the coffee table in the saloon...uh...drinking 

a cup of coffee or tea or whatever was there 
as if...uh... I couldn't  care a damn about what 
was going on, just to show my disdain, you unde
rstand. I thought that 
this would ma ke a 
significant impression. I was really, you know, ha
lf serious, half child...uh. And that's 
what I did. And they came  in and my sister
 had...uh...a side porch, you know with sliding 
glass doors and she displayed all kinds 
of...uh...lots of precious things...porcelain, 
crystal...uh...the things that you got for our
 wedding...uh...heirlooms, stuff of that sort. 

And, of course, they were after it. And one of
 the Nazis, a kind of clumsy fellow, who 
had never handled doors like this tried to ope
n and he sort of fumbled around and he 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0204  
15 
 
couldn't figure out how this...this door opened. 
Yal. Because the only door probably that 
he...he got to know was the door on hinges. And 
I could see him sort of...I could almost 
read his mi nd...and holding his foot, his leg up in
 order to kick the door in, and I jumped 
up. Yal. And confronted him as muc h as I 
could confront him. I mean my head was 
probably the height of his breast bone. A
nd I said you know...and I again reme mber the 
words verbatim...there are two ways of openi
ng this door. I said, "One is you lift your leg 
and kick it in like that, and I just imitated wh
at he was doing, and the other one is like this 
and I put out one little finger 
and I just ma de the door open. 
And don't you think that's a 
better way. And I looked him in the face 
and he looked back and no words were 
exchanged...no further word was exchanged between us. And, of course, they packed all 
the stuff up and took it away and walked out. A
nd that was another visit. It was the most 

terrible because of what happened in the morn
ing and that could have easily ended up, as 
I say, with our flying out of the window. Uh...I
f you don't mi nd, a few things occur to me . 
I want to go back to them. First of all (cle
aring throat), there wa
s first of all two...two 
personal encounters and...uh...that 
I think of. Uh...I had...I to
ld you before that I had...I 
had learned in some way that 
in certain critical si tuations 
I could face up to things and 
some how assert control. It was almost 
a kind of...uh...psychological insight...some...s ome 
measure of c e rtainty that I 
had at the time. Some...some voice that came to me from 
outside myself. And I reme mber that one of
 the time s it happened was even before the 
Nazis came in. Uh...It was winter time  and I 
wa s dressed...uh...in a very
 nice winter coat. 
It was a new coat. with a herringbone and a ve
lvet collar. And here was a much bigger 
boat but ragged, obviously from very poor ci
rcumstances who came up and our steps met 
at the corner and I knew that he wasn't  going 
to shake my hands. I realized that he was 

gonna beat me  up. And I always
 had empathy for  the underdog. I had a very, very strong 
empathy. I had really always a strong heart for 
poor people, for animals, for all things of 
that sort, and I felt ashame d actually of
 my...of our circumst
ances. Even so, God 
knows,...uh...I was luxuriating my...the presence of the coat with norma lly books, you 

know, or games of skills. They never bought me a model set because I mi ght break my 

leg or some thing, which I probably would ha
ve (chuckle) if they bought me one. But I 
always had that...that feeling that...uh...I 
felt uncomfortable of having more than 
some body else and so I didn't have to fake a
nything. I...I really had an understanding for 
him and a fe eling for him. And it may have been
 this fact that sort of edged away fear 
because it took the place 
of fear. It was...it was the feeli
ng that possessed me . And I said 
to him...uh..."You know, I want...uh...there's some th
ing I want to tell you." And I said it 
in a way that...uh...some how or other seemed to engage him, seemed to engage his 

interest. I was listening and I to
ld him about the fact that I 
wanted to go to Palestine and 
that ma ny of us, even those of us who co
me from so-called...uh...homes that were more 

affluent really wanted to 
choose this life for ourselves 
and that I understand where he 
came from and understand his circumstances 
that...that ma ny of...of
 friends of mi ne, 
people I know have chosen a life of work on 
the land, hard work. Yal. And there wasn't  
really as much difference between us as mi ght
 appear. And that I wasn't  responsible for 
the fact that...that he was poor and that he 
was in difficult circumstances and we almos t  

became friendly and they told...he told me  about
 the fact that his father wa s beating him 
up and so on and so forth and, you know, his father was a drunkard. But I will never 

forget the words that he said to me  at 
the end and the words were...and this was a poor, 
ma ybe se mi -literate, ragged youth, ma ybe a 
year before the Nazis came...I would say 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0204  
16 
 
about... He sa ys, "You know, Hitler is going to 
come here and then I am sorry...I am 
going to be sorry for all of you." And these ar
e words that I have forgotten easily. That 
was one encounter. The other one wa s alrea
dy under the...under the Nazis. I was...uh...I 
think walking home  at the time and...it was a
nd it was the place wher
e our shul was, the 
little synagogue. Uh...There were sitting in the 
front pew. My father incidentally was the 
vice-president of the other group, whichis...which was a Zionist philanthropic 
organization. And my father 
was very active in public a
ffairs and as a philanthropist, 
something that once saved him from the Nazis because I remember in a 

procession...procession that came by, and I wa
s sort of listening at the window, and 
some body was shouting, "Let's take old Schm
eltzer," and...uh...somebody else said, "Oh, 
leave him. At least he helps his own ki
nd." So strange things happened...uh...even in 
those time s. There was this shul in the a
nd I was not far away. As a ma tter of fact, 
mi dway up that street, in the where our shul wa
s. Our shul was at the corner of the where 
we lived in this. Midway up there was a restau
rant at that time. And as I was walking... 
probably...I don't re me mber exactly whether 
I wa s walking home  or walking away 
from...at any rate I suddenly was surrounded by 
some thing like a dozen boys. It was like 
a ring around me . And there were closing in 
on me . And it was clear 
that they were going 
to beat me  up. All of them! Together! And ag
ain that particular se
nse came over me that 
allowed me  to detach myself from my persona
l circumstance and take on another voice. 
It was almost as if I was reading a book. 
And i magination has its place at times. And I 

said to them...I...I raised my hand because 
I realized you know, I have to do some thing 
that attracts attention...I ra
ised my hand at the time and said, "Look. Befor e  you beat me  
up, I have some thing interesting to te
ll you. And, of course, you know, rich boy...I 
mean...everybody is curious...I mean no ma tter 
what. I said, You know, what's  happening 
here. There's a dozen of you Gentiles, Christ
ians who want to beat up one of me , one 
Jew. Now what are you doing there. You're real
ly declaring that one Jew is as good as 12 
of you." And that...that sort of
...that sort of ma de  them l
ook up. Yal. And I said, "I am 
going to tell the Nazi party about it and, you see,
 they'll be very angry at you." (Laughter) 
God knows where this came  from. Yal. It's rea
lly absolutely absurd. It's ridiculous, but it 
some how engaged their attention and they st
arted to discuss this
 ma tter amongst each 
other. (Laughter) Because they were as li
ttle...uh...learning. They had just...they picked 
up anti-Semitism probabl y from early childhood 
because it was endemi c in Austria. And 
as they were discussing things, a little
 gap opened. They...you know, at one point they 
drew apart. It was just enough for me  to fl
ee through and I ran. At 
that time  the person 
who held the world's record in long dist
ance running was a fellow called –I think I 

outran him. I ran so fast up, away from our ho
me , up the to which was a parallel street, a 
very, very magnifi cent. Well, it's a very lively vi tal street  that led up to the ticket of the I 

over took a train and remember I told you they
 had these open platforms and I jumped up 
and there weren't sufficiently close to me. 
I mean they couldn't overtake me and they 
couldn't get on the train and so I got away 
that particular time. Now I had me ntioned 
some thing about shuls. I want to go back to 
this because some thing else comes up in my 
mi nd. A year before I had Bar Mitzvah and I re
member standing in front of the mi rror in 

our L-shaped hall, the one that I described 
to you before. My mother plunked some  kind 

of blue hat on me  which almost blotted my
 face out. I had this 
little round face you know, 
and I was frightened out of my wits, and I 
was led to...uh...the shul almos t  like a calf to 
slaughter and I had to give this long you know
 which was half in Hebrew and half in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0204  
17 
 
German and these...these were long affairs a
nd you had to know them 
by heart. It took at 
least half an hour or later. 
Yal. You studied it for it months. And I reme mb er (clearing 
throat) I stood there and I looked at the pe
ople and the shul wa s full of people and my  
heart sank. This was definitely 
not a mome nt of c ontrol. A
nd my voice said bye bye, just 
took leave of me  and when I opened my 
voice...my mouth, almost no voice came  out. 
Yal. And my teacher, Hebrew teache r
...his name  was Daft, D A F T...was  a young, 
modern ma n actually. He sat behind me  and he l
eaned forward at this point and he said to 
me , "You know, if Mussolini can do it, you 
can do it." I me an, again, outrageous 
statement, but this man understood something in
 me because I got so enraged at the fact 
that this is doing some thing and I can't  doi
ng it....Yal...that I completely forgot myself 
and I delivered a splendid oratory and ev
erybody was weeping and the last one who 
wasn't  weeping was my sister and I considered 
this as a personal affront. And then I sort 
of focused my look. I beamed it at her like a 
lazer beam and I said one or two sentences 
as I glazed and then she st
arted weeping. I was very ha
ppy. And then our...our fa mily 
doctor, Frye, he was crying too. Everybody 
was crying (laughter) in that synagogue. 
Now, I...I mention this because Daft, who wa
s my teacher, under the Nazi unfortunately 
some thing very tragic befell of him...befell hi
m. One day his wife came t o my mother and 
she was literally wringing her hands and sa
id she doesn't  know what to do because her 
husband had simply become  mad. He picked 
up a knife. He said that she wanted to 
poison him. She was afraid of her life. She wa
s afraid to go to the authorities. And...here 
you had a world of ma dness inside in respons
e to ma dness outside...uh... 
It was literally a 
world where all the controls, all the dams
 broke. Uh...And I don't really know what 
happened. But I do know that I once visited his 
place. That was in the good times before 
my Bar Mitzvah and I was so impressed by th
e stacks of books he had and there was and 
I read the title of every one....  
 
END OF TAPE 2, SIDE 2   
 
 service people of me dic a l who were guard
ing the prisoners inside. And they were 
outside. And inside were hundreds of German 
prisoners of war. And these were giants. 
They were sailors. They were apparently
 caught...uh...you know either on the ships or 
whatever. You can imagine. Here was a group of 30, 40 young Jewish school children, all 

from whatever happened in Europe and...uh...I th
ink...I don't want to be adamant about it. 
I seemed to reme mber there was swastika fl
ags inside. Yal. But I am not going to sign 

that underwriting. Uh...Certainl
y, there was..uh..a planned Nazi atmosphere also. Yal. 
There were no demonstrations 
against us. It was just enough 
to see these fellows around 
and we in the mi dst. There were only 30, 
40 of us and we were children..very young boys 
of 16. None was older than 16. There were
 only a few Polish among the m. Then what 
happened was... we were about 2 or 3 months
 in that camp. What happened was that 
some  of us were Orthodox. Now I wasn't Orthodox myself, but some  of us were 

Orthodox, and they were strictly kosher, a
nd they would not eat a non-kosher food. And 

there was no provision for non-kosher food, and we
 all declared solidarity with those who 
were Orthodox. So they wouldn't eat non-kosher food. We  di dn't eat non-kosher food. 

The result of it we were all starvi ng andwe were literally starving because...uh...all you 

could eat was cheese...uh...when...when it was 
served. And I reme mber the mostly 
seemed to serve meat which we couldn't  eat
. Yal. And I ate plenty of toast with jam 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0204  
18 
 
because I was working in the kitchen. I was very
 partial to toast and jam, must have eaten 
so much I c ouldn't stand it anymore. But we we
re literally starving and in the end became  
so...uh...drained of strength...uh...that some times...s
ometi mes we were lying out there on 
the grass and we couldn't even...hardly c
ould get up. We  were really that much 
weakened. I reme mber the Polish lad that wa
s...I told you about this ma n, this , who 
become  a friend of mi ne, was giving us daily 
lectures and he had 
extensive knowledge in 
various areas. And I remember in biology in pa
rticular, biology and literature and history 
and politics. These were his ma in subjects
...and in psychology. And this man was so well 
read that through the three months he could give us daily
 lectures of 2 or 3 hours every 
day...Yal...and really have us riveted. And...a
nd through this camp, there passed different 
groups. Someones, there was a group of Jewish 
adults and of a group of Italian adults. I 

reme mber the Italian were so different from the Germans. They transforme d the...the 

camp into a soccer stadium. Yal. You know, I...I
 later ma ke friends with Italians. I love 
these people. I mean they are just so huma
n. Prison or no prison, they were kicking that 

ball around. Yal. So different from the very...and I am not saying this against the German 

as such, but they were very solemn 
and stodgy. Yal. There was no note of joy. 
Nothing...nothing to remember. One thing was they
 all...a lot of them carved things. They 

were wonderful at carving things. They ma de little sa iling boats that you could push 

through the neck of a bottle you 
know. And I wa tched that and 
they carved pipes with all 
kinds of...uh...legendary monsters with shaped
 faces on them. One day, one of the Nazis 
there...uh...was name d Putsy Humstanker. Now I 
am saying this from just hearing about 
it. But Putsy Humstanker, I was told was a fr iend of Hitler's. How he had gotten 

himself...uh...captured or what, I don't know.  
And...and I was told that he was...he was a 
fellow who played piano, entertained with 
Hitler's piano and so on. Putsy Humstanker 
came to us one afternoon drunk and he said, 
"Look. The Germans are plotting to get rid 
of you. And I am your friend." Yal. Such fr
iends I can do without, but...we weren't. So, 
we couldn't look to the British where we coul
d sa y. They weren't...I me a n they were 
outside. Uh...We arme d ourselves with clubs, 
this, that and the ot
her and sit guards at 
night, but you know in a sense ma ybe becau
se we were young and ma ybe because...well, 
we were the way we were...We  would betr
oy slogans on our hearts and...and then and 
Hebrew...uh...slogans...and so on. We di
d not allow the fact that we
 were really just a tiny 
group in this German sea. To the tourist to
 anyway. But nonetheless,
 there were difficult 
times and don't forget this was just about th
e time that France fell in May. I reme mber...I 
reme mber one day that we lying outside. It 
was also a day of ma rvelous summer, blue 
skies, so radiant. And not far away fr
om us, there was a...a mi litary...uh...Yal... a 
military...uh...airport and I saw some riding from
 there and it was so close by that they 
skimme d over us. I was lying there with some
 others and we were looking up in the sky 
and there was these pl anes. There were so close you could see the heads of the pilots. 

And we could see the scarves flying up and 
the German bombe r s were up there...up deep 
in the sky up above. We  could hear them the m dr oning.  And those ma rvelous youngsters 

were flying straight at them
. Yal. It's...You know, war is a 
terrible thing, but I have to 
admit it's one of the mos t  beautiful sights that 
I have seen. And to see those silver planes. 
I mean if you detach yourself from the ho
rror and to see afterw
ards the denotations 
blossomi ng like great yellow, red flowers and th
en parachuting and then when the planes 
burst, there was a deeper color and then, th
e parachutes coming dow
n like thistles. Yal. 
That was an unforgettable sight. 
I...I felt very, very proud of 
those fighters that went up, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0204  
19 
 
and I am not a military pe rson. But, in any case, as I said to go back or to go forward, 
France fell and the Germans became very cocky, 
very arrogant . And some  of them threw 
their finger across the throat
 when they passed us. Yal. And I don't know what our 
feelings were at the time, frankly. I think so ma ny things had happened to us in the 

beginning that suddenly, I didn'
t...I didn't function too much e motionally. Yal. Uh...And 
suddenly, one day they decided to
 evacuate us to send us either
 to Canada or Australia. I 
am not sure. And we we re...uh...meant to go on a certain ship. I believe the name  was 

Andora Star. Some how t hat name  stuck in my
 mi nd. I always associated it with that 
particular situation. And all the Germans...uh... 
in our camp were sent on the Andora Star 
and there were some  Jewish people, including a brother of my  brother-in-law, from ot her 

camps. He was interned too, of
 course, who was in the Andora Star. Now we were taken 
off maybe a day or two before embarka
tion because...uh...Jewish...the Jewish Federation 
it. All kinds of people were working frantica lly behind the scenes with the home offic e , 

with the war office, this that and the ot
her thing. Look...what...this...our Jewish with 
the– They are boys. What you want to send 
them to Canada or Australia for with 
Germans. They took us off the last mome
nt. You know wha t  happened to the Andora 
Star. It was torpedoed. My brother-in-law's  
brother was killed among the others and later 
on when I was in again in another place called– I me t one of the rare Jewi sh survivors of 

that ship incidentally so I
...so I...I know the story all ar
ound. And what he told me  was 
that when the ship was torpedoed, the Jews we
re down in the steerage.
 I mean they were 
down, and the Germans and the British were 
up and they were close to...and they...they 
took possession of all the lifeboa
ts and the Jews were not al
lowed into the life boats and 
he was swimming along and he said he must ha
ve been in the water a hour or so. You 

can't  measure time in that condition. And he was 
almost losing his last ounce of strength, 
just couldn't go on and there was this life boat 
near him and he ma naged to swim up to it 
and stretch out his hand and get 
hold of it. And I have to sa
y this ironic episode that 
happened was that a British person...a British, one of the ma t e s of the ship, said, "Sorry, 

old boy. You know, full up. This is not the last 
boat." And the Germans s a id, "Oh, let the 
poor bastard on." And they pulled him up and so
 he was saved. Yal. And I think he must 
have been one of the very, very, very rare
 Jewish survivors from the Andora Star. And 
there was another occasion when death was ju
st moving past me  as if he didn't know 
me ...or didn't know me  or didn't real
ly want to know me ...uh...and...and...and 
ma ny...many other people have stories of 
this kind. And those of us who escaped...uh... 
ma ny of us had ma ny es capes before you could finally get away. That takes us up 

to...uh...beyond...beyond the Andora Star 
and the return t
o...to internme nt to Lensfield. 
No...We  didn't  return. They didn't take us out
, of course. We  rema ined in Lensfield, but 
shortly afterwards...uh...we were finally releas
ed and I reme mber the commandant of the 
camp wept. Uh..There were a number of ster
ling British figures I have to say. Uh...As I 

told...as I told you, Britain is one of the count
ries I have warm affection. It's not that 
everybody was a saint, but you ma ke an overall a
ppraisal of a nation, of
 a civilization and 
in England I loved them and my...my brothe
r in Pa lestine did not. He saw...he saw the 
British fr om another...another angl e, but I have to say that  I experienced them in their 

own country and there are some  just l
ovely, ma rvelous...uh...persons there and the 
general tone is...is...is just lot more civili
zed than the one I enc
ountered generally in 
Austria. I have to say that. Very differe
nt. Now...uh...uh...there was another officer there 
in the internme nt camp. We called him Aun
tie. We called him Auntie because he was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0204  
20 
 
such a passionately devoted soul. He  was su
ch a lovely ma n. Out of his own pockets, he 
would buy us things...socks and undergarments 
and stuff. He was another one who cried 
when we left. Yal. He was a ma rvelous person. Now...Don't ...don't think that every 
British was like this, but you don't need to meet that ma ny persons and they do 

leave...uh...a strong...uh...impression behind them. Ya
l. They sort of light the way. It's 

almost as if fate...uh...has decided we ll, you kno
w, you've gone through this, that and the 
other. We 'll send you a little light. Yal. 
So afterwards, when I got out of the 
internme nt...uh...there wa s an episode and he
re I am not absolutely certain about 
the...uh... timing of things or the sequence of 
events, but I know that my sister was 
evacuated to Spalding and I ma naged to be ther
e. I ma naged to be for a few months there, 
working the land, because I was then at th
e time on the war essential work order. 
Uh...just to be close to her and I ma nage
d to survive some  bombing attacks that 
practically pulled the hous
e down over us because the Germans mi stook Spalding for 
which was a nearby railroad station, you know
. And they bombed...they released all the 
bombs on Spalding. Uh...Amongst other things
...uh...they destroyed the zoo and killed a 

lot of animals there. Uh...Afte
r that I...I was in...uh...I was in London for some  ti me  and I 
can't  date that. I know that I worked in a 
factory. I know that I...uh...I thought up ways of 

speeding up production by a multiple of 2 or
 3 by...because there were more machines 
there than...than people. And I worked out 
a ma thematical system whereby you could 
keep 3 or 4 machines in operation, you 
know, only attended by l person. And you could 
do it faultlessly. It wasn't even difficult. Ho
wever, I was watched by the supervisor. You 
know it is very strange, you know. And incident
ally, I had a similar encounter because 
not everybody in Britain was giving their best
 for the war effort obviously, but ma ny did 
and ma ny were very heroic. So again, huma
nity and with all 
its...but...uh...there was 
another occasion in Spalding. In Spalding...uh...I wo
rked for a period of time  in the sugar 
refinery near the laboratory and...uh...I had...uh...
another encounter of a similar nature 
where I wanted to be a little more productive than a certain person, a certain woma n 

and...uh... She then...She  became so angry with me  because she...because I was in the 

laboratory...I was supposed to be 
testing the mol a sses in the va
rious stages of preparation 
as to be come  to refineme nt. And she spread
 the story about me th
at I was a German spy. 
But unfortunately...fortunate
ly, rather, she was known as
 a liar. Nobody paid any 
credence to her. Uh...I was also
 in Cambridge. So that was a 
very intense time . I was also 
in Cambridge at some  time ...uh...but  this was afte
r I had gotten to... I returned to... It was 
in...That was a place around... You know– 
the great...uh...I am ma king and liquor 
ma king and so on. And we...we were living th
ere in really terri
ble conditions. The 
difference between and  was difference between night and day...day and night rather 

because was an unsanitary camp. It had been condemned by t he British. It had no 

facilities, no toilet facilities
 even and so on and so forth. And we worked like slaves on 

the land. I was there for about ha
lf a year. Uh...I eventually le
ft and I went to Cambridge. 
I was followed by some  of the...uh...at that time
, a friend of mi ne, my alter ego almos t  
and he went to Cambridge and...uh...I had the ch
ildish idea that I only needed to go to 
Ca mbridge and all universitie
s would open their door and say, "Herr Schmeltzer, you 
know, now you are here. Why didn'
t  you come  e a rlier?  You see,
 we have just the place 
for you." Well, I ended up as a gardener in 
College. (Laughter) And I have to tell you 
it's...it's a really amusing little
 tale because at that time I was preparing...I was on one of 
my studies. You see, in...in Vienna because my
 parents' forced me  to study. I didn't want

to do it. But once I had left and I wasn't  
under constraint, I felt 
that what I most 
passionately wanted in life was to study. Yal.
 I always read intens
ively and extensively, 
you understand. Now I wanted to study. So I 
thought going to Cambridge some how or 
other was all you needed to do and say here I 
am and that's it. Well, as I say, I became a 
gardener and I...I am ashame d to say I used 
part of my ti me actu
ally for study purposes. 
What I did was that I...I or
ganized the study plan to two 
areas. Uh...the...uh...liberal art 
things if you like, languages a
nd literature and that kind of 
stuff and grammar, I had this 
little notebook that I could 
hold in the palm of my hand. Mathematics and other 
things...mathematics I would rake out and 
smooth out a plot of land, you know, and I 
would...I would draw geometric figures and so
 on on the land and work them out. And 
then I would enter them in a little notebook. Bu
t it turned out that the which were an 
admi nistrative group of they were looking behind the window sills you know in the 
stately buildings and they were observing this
 strange person who wa
s drawing figures in 
the soil, you understand. And they couldn't fi
gure out what it was I was actually doing, 
but it seemed to occupy me for an enormously
 length of periods of time and I seemed to 
be absolutely obsessed with it. So I was even
tually called there and the words that...that 
I...that they said to me  were, you know, 
we have observed you over a period of time 
and...uh...frankly, most of the time you seemed to be scratching things in the ground or 

looking at the palm of your hand. We  couldn'
t figure out what it is you are doing, but you 
didn't do enough work so I am afraid we have to fire you. So I drew mys e lf up to...and I 

am not very enormous length at the time...I 
said, "I am really ashamed of you because 

this is supposed to be an 
intellectual...uh... institution a
nd...uh...I can tell you that I am 
probably more intelligent than any of the st
udents you have, but they have lots more 
money than I have and if you were really an 
institution of learning 
and not of money, you 
would say, "Look. We  really want you here 
as a student, but obviously you don't know 
anything about things of that sort. Good Da
y." And I walked out. And afterwards I wa s 
really kind of...I was almost trembling because I 
wasn't ...I wasn't  cock sure at all. Yal. I 
think it was...it was part of my general natu
re. Anger that was kind of spilling out, you 
know. In retrospect...uh...there was very l
ittle...they... they... they...that they could do 
about it. I guess they were only acting accord
ing to their best understanding of the way 
the world worked. And I was little...a bit out
side the scheme  of things. So after 
Ca mbridge I thought...I almost...alm
ost was 18. I wanted to volunteer to be a fighter pilot. 
Maybe this period of the planes 
flying over...also the fact...the fact that I...I just wanted 
to...to...I wanted revenge.   
 
Q:  May I...We have 10 mi nutes left on this tape
, so what I am going to suggest we do is if 
you can encapsulate what happened to you and 
tell us what happened because I want to 
bring you...uh...to where we had disc
ussed earlier. I want to br
ing you to after the war in 
Canada.  
 

A:  Alright. Yal. 

 

Q: If you could just tell me  what happened. 

 

A:  Yal. I can...I can Yal. I can do that. Uh... B
ecause it doesn't  take too long time. The fa ct 
of the ma tter is that I...volunteered as a 
fighter pilot and...uh...I went through me dical 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0204

examination. There were examinations and they
 seemed to work out well, but I did get a 
letter eventually...sorry they 
couldn't take me . They didn't take any at the time . And I 
wasn't  called an...I was an Austrian Jew. Au
stria was an enemy. So in England I was an 
Austrian. I was an enemy. In Austria I was a 
Jew. I fell between the cracks. Uh...At that 
time I could have volunteered for the corps, but 
I wasn't  going to be in a service corps. I 
want to be in a fighting unit. I thought
...again, here my childish naiveté came  
through...that if I...that the mo ment they allowe
d us to..to...volunteer to join a...a comb at 
unit...uh...I would be allowed to join my brother.
 It was again a strong 
urge that I had to 
join...and I always worshiped...I 
really worshipped my brother even so he some ti me s beat 
me  up. I have to say that. But he was a great 
person. He was really one of the heroes in 
my life. And there are not ma
ny of them. maybe, in retrospe
ct, was the great hero, but 
Leo of my family was not among them. And I 
had the feeling...somebody told me , one of 
the person recruitment said to me, "Yes
, you...you volunteer and we'll send you wherever 
you want to go." I believed it. Of course (l
augh), you see, the mome nt we were allowed 
to volunteer for the comb at unit...I vol
unteered and I was...uh...accepted. That...it took 
some ti me because I only joined
 in the early 43 I believe  it. 
It wasn't  43 for sure. I don't 
have the date on me  exa c tly.  
 

Q: Where were you sent?  
Where were you sent?   
 

A:  We ll, first of all we went through 
16...16 weeks of training. 
You know there was 6 
weeks and then 10 weeks. 
 

Q:  We  don't  have the time . After trai
ning, where were you se
nt after training. 
 

A: I was...I was sent to a mo untain unit, th
e... I think it was the 52nd Division and I am 
quoting from my me mory and...uh...this was a di
vision that was essent
ially stationed in 
the northern mountains of Scotland where the 
snow and ice conditions are at least where 
we went into training, not where the general 
camp was. It approxima ted the conditions in 
the Arctic Ci rcle. Uh...And I contracted a ve
ry severe condition. We
...we sleptin snow 
and some times it was even worse when we went below the snow line. And we slept 

literally in icy water. And...and we went out
 for training some times for 2 weeks at a 
stretch, 10 days to 2 weeks at a stretch. I mi
ght sleep about, at most, an hour a night til 
you woke up in the icy water. You only slept 
out of exhaustion. I contracted a fairly 
serious arthritic c
ondition, you know, with pain the 
swollen limbs and so on. And 
eventually...uh...this...uh... went on for about 2 y
ears. Essentially I understood that we are 
stationed there to...uh...in case th
ere was a German attack fr
om Norway...from Northern 
Europe, you know, to protect his flank. Even
tually this unit was sent off...uh...2 or 3 
weeks before Dunkirk...not Dunkirk... That
 happened before, of course... Before 

the...uh...invasion of Europe and...uh...again, I wa
s taken off the unit about a couple of 
days before the unit in training a
nd I want to tell you what happened.  
 

Q: If we have time . That 's  the problem. You were just taken off? 

 

A: I was...I was...I was taken off...I 
was actually commanded...uh...not to go and...uh...it's 
unfortunate if you don't have time becau
se it's only three sentences.   

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0204  
23 
 
Q: Okay. Go ahead. 
 

A: Yal. It was really through the interven
tion of an officer who...uh...was a poet or some  
literary person who had gone on walks with me . 
We talked about literature and so on and 
he said to me, " Look. You are a si ck person. You have this arthritic conditions. You 

could go and should go and have yourself ex
amined by doctors because you're not in 

condition to go." And I said, "Under no ci
rcumstances I am going to do this. I 
volunteered and I will never do it." And this 
ma n had an order sent to me  by the me dical 
board which commanded me  to appear before 
them. I appeared before them and to my 
utter amazement, I was downgraded from A to 
C-2. It was really a strange story. Uh...I 
was taken off a day or two before the...the 
unit went in training. I was broken up over 

that. I was really...I...I had extremely mi
xed emotions over this whole thing...uh...because 
I...I thought ma ybe I could have gone, but th
ere was no way I could have gone.   H 
  
 
 

Q: You stayed in Britain... We have about 
2 mi nutes. Uh...You stayed in Britain until the 
end of the war.  
 

A: Oh, sure. I st ay...I st ayed in Britain until 
the war. I was demobilized in 1947. And as a 
ma tter of fac t , I...you know when you're demobilized you're given...uh...certain 

things...uh...few dozen belongings, what not
...underwear. The most ma gnificent thing 
was the raincoat. And the first
... This was a really ma rvelous 
raincoat, and the first thing 
that I did was to go to Hyde park and again 
it was beautiful summer. At least this was a 
summery day. And so I didn't need to put 
the raincoat on, you know. I had it over my 
arm. And there in Hyde Park, if you have ever
 been there, there's 
a lake there, a boating 
lake. And I put my rain...rain coat simply 
on...on the bench and then walked away from it 
and walked to the lake to look at the boats 
and then I reme mb ered 
I had a raincoat. So I 
returned to the bench and I di
dn't have a raincoat anymore. 
Uh...It was the shortest person 
ever was and there was a fellow near ther
e who said, Oh you...you are the owner of the 
raincoat. We ll, I have got to tell you, there was 
a prostitute here and she saw the raincoat 
and just picked it up and walked away with
 it. So...uh...I have to say, here was...here 
was...uh...the legacy to the government of th
e British Army, you know. But, at least, at 
least, it was good for one person. Let us. I just
 want to assume  that she was a needy 

person and she really needed 
that raincoat. (Laughter)  
 

Q: You me t your fa mily after the war?   

 

A: I... Yal. After...after the 
war essentially I...I ma naged...I 
went into the Polytechnic... 
Polytechnic for a year because it was too la
te to go to a college. In...in Britain the 
University went to external and internal. A
nd then I passed some  examination. I have to 
say, with a certain touch of modest
y I hope, that I did extremely well. 
 

Q: We are about to run out of tape. Just 
tell me  very briefly. You got your degree? 
 

A:  Yes. I got in of Economi cs. I got my degree in political scienc
e in economi cs and...uh...I 
worked just for a few months...uh..in a bank, but
 I had decided already to go to Israel 
and...uh...uh...that is what I did. Now the 
whole...the whole thing about

Q: We have 30 seconds. 
 

A: Well, about in 1950... You can't  do this
 in 30 seconds. It's  impossible.  
 

Q: No. No. Tell me . Just tell me  wher
e your parents were and how you me t.   
 

A: My parents...my parents 
were in...uh...uh...in New York. In Coney Islands, as a ma tter of 
fact where they had a little store with 
my brother-in-law. My father...uh...they were 
talking about...they were talking about obvi
ously...If you're talking about the time of 
1950-51, when I was at the University, I ha
d...uh...gone across to see them, and here was 
the story of how I got into the Un
ited States via Canada. So...uh...   
 

Q:  Okay.   

 

A:  You said there's no time for that.   

 

Q:  Okay. No. Let's hold it. Cut it. That
's  it. Thank you very muc h. I thank you.
