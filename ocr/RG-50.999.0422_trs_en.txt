your f am ily's changed. Tell us about that tim e before the war andbefore Kristallnacht, about 
yo u r  f a m i l y.
 
>> SusanT aube: W ell, it was a little town, about5,000people. And among them, there were 

about 20,25 Jewishf am ilies.  Four children school

aged
, s
c h oo
l-
aged children. 
 
 
Life was normal.  My parentshad a store that sold baby carrots, 
sewing m achine, whatever you needed to buy.  T he surrounding area was m ostly agricult ure.  
Not muchelse going on there.
  
So this was the point to com eand purchase what you needed 
for your house,for your clothing,f or whatever you needed. 
 
 
Life was normal, very normal. W ehad children. W ehad 
neighbors. W e were invited for Christm as. Then came 
P
assover. T hey cam e to
 
our house.  
T hey wanted 
m a t zo
, 
whatever specialties we hadonPassover.  It was very nice, ver y nice 
neighbors, everything. 
 
 
But things changed very rapidly in 1933, when Hitler came to 
power.  Everybody had to go and vote.  Afteryou voted, you received
 
the littlepin.  You voted 
yes or you voted no.  But around the places where you voted, they watched very closely wh at 
you were voting f or. So everybody was voting yes f or Hitler.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Inf act, Susan,I think you said the pin said" I votedfor Hitler"  or "I didn't vote 

f o r Hit le r. "
 
>> SusanT aube: T heJewish people. W e didn't know what was in storef or us.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You
 
told m e about aneighbor, the Schoenf am ily.  Tell us about them.
 
>> SusanT aube: T hey were two houses away f rom  us. T hey were ver y religious people.W e

shareda lot of things together. In Germany, at that tim e it was af rugal time. It was af ter 
W orldW ar I, and people, really, m aterialistic
 
--
 
they were ver y poor, really.  So we shareda lot 
of  things together likenewspaper and whatever.  They had chickens. T hey give u
s e ggs.  It 

was a nice, neighbor
ly s it u a t ion
, h
elping each other.
 
 
T hings changed rapidly in 1933.  I went to school. It was m y 
second grade then.  In thebeginning it wasn'ttoobad. T he children,we still played together.  
But af ew m onths later I was separated, ignored.  Just ignored. That's all.  Nobody foughtfor 
m eto participate inanything.  T he teachersputm e separately on abench in the classroom .  
Just ignoring.  
 
 
T his was the school 
I attended f or four years.  I must have been 
a pretty good student, because oneday I graduated intoam iddle school. Theeducational 
system  is diff erent in Germ any than in here.  In m iddle school we learned languages.  I 
leathered French. The same situation there. Inf act, it was much worse there.  By the endof  
theday there was abench.  I was sitting on the bench, justby m yself
, t
he whole row of  
benches.W hen cam erecess, Ihad tobef irst one to leave and the last one to com e in. I sat 

b y m ys e l f .
  
Nobody paid attention to m e. 
 
 
I was in that schoolf orabout two years.  I don't know what m y 
situation was.  Anyhow, m y parents decided,or were inf orm ed, to take me out of that school.  I 
was enrolled ina school in Frankfurt am  Maim , ina Jewish day school.  I lived with com plete 
strangers there.  But this wasn't too badbecause at least I was am ong m y own people.  Ihad 
playm ates.  Anorm al life, likea child should have.

But things weren't norm al eventhere because people started to 
e
m i gr a t e .   P eo
ple worried about jobs.  A lot of people lost their jobs in 1935.  And the 
Nurem berg Laws came into effect,that the Jewish people couldn'tparticipate inanything f rom  
the governm ent, entertainment, or whatever. Ever ybody lost their jobs.
  
People had to 
e
m igrate, which wasn't ver y easy because not many countries
 
--
 
it was af terW orldW ar I.  
 
 
Ever ybody was still strugglin g, I guess, or whatever.  I was a 
child.  I wouldn't know the circum stancesthere.  But I know m y parents tried to 
imm
igrate to 
Am erica, but we had no close relatives.  My m other was a only child.  My father was an only 
child sono close relatives.
  
 
 
Finally, f inally, somebody cam eand vouchedfor m yf ather. At 
thattim e you needed to imm igrate to Am erica, you had somebody vouchf or you in America 
that youdon'tf all under the governm ent. So thatperson vouchedf or my father.  Say you 
com ef irst.  Youf inda job. Get yourself  settled.  Andthen we wil l help you tobring thefam ily 
over.
 
 
Som y f ather gotthe aff idavit that came to the consulate in 
Berlin.  And whenhe called up how long it wo uld take
 
--
 
he receiveda num ber.  And he called 
up tof ind out how long it would takef or thenum ber to com eup.T hey told him it can takeup 

to three tof our years.  Ok
.  W
h a t c a
n you do?  You have to wait andsee.
 
 
In them eantim e cameKristallnacht.  Kristallnacht, was
 
--
 
lik e  
you saw in the picture here. The reason give nf or this was in 1938,I think it was thebeginning 
of  1938, the Gestapo cam e tothe housesof  Jewish people
 
who were not Germ an citizens, 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

who cam ef rom Poland and Russia orf rom the east, but livedf orm any, m any years already in 
Germ any.  Children were born in Germ any.  But even if  youare bornin Germany, your 
citizenship goes where your f ather is com ing from . Soeven if  they com e f rom  Poland, the 
children, they're Polish citizens.
 
 
So they came at nightanddeported thesepeople,took them to 
the train stationand deported them tothe border of Poland.
  
Am ongthem  were the parentsof  
a young m an who was studying in Paris. W hen hef ound out what happenedtohis parents,he 

got ver y angr y.  I guess he wanted to pay attention of what is happening there.  Foolishly he 
went to the Germ an em bassy with a gun and killed the secretary there. W ell, he didn't kill him
.  
He injuredhim for three days. T hree days, Germ any organized what is calledKristallnacht.  I 

was in Frankfurt at that time.  
 
 
I lived with a fam ily by the nam eof  Bumburger.  There were 
about three,four Jewis hf amilies. The rest were Christianfam i
lie s .
  
Around 10:00
 
in the 
m orning,people cam eto the door,didn't ring the bell or anything like that.  Just knocking on 

thedoor, cam e in. W as nice. I don't rem ember really.  Dem olished the whole apartm ent. W e 
didn't have a plate to eat f rom .  Pillow
s were torn open.  Plants were thrown outof  windows.  
T he whole apartm entwas a m ess. And they went f rom each apartm ent to the next one. And 

thathappened toall Jewish properties.
  
T he businesses were also destroyed. W hen you 
walked along the streets in som e sections where
 
people still had abusinessat thattim e, their 
windo ws were sm ashed in. Everything was i nside the store,too. 
 
 
In the evening cam e areport. Thepolice came again to the 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

apartm ents
 a
ndarrested allm ale persons over theage of 16, between 16 and65,and took 
them  to concentration cam ps.  At that tim e itwas Buchenwald, Dachau, and Sachsenhausen.
 
W ell, after this, the schools were closed. T he teachers were arrested.  So I wenthom etom y 
hometown. The samehappened there, too. My f athertried to hide,but thepolice came and 
said, look, it's a small town.  Everybody kne w each other. They toldm y m other if  you don't
 
--
 
if  
he doesn't give him self up, we have to take you in. W e have tobring som ebody to the station. 
 
So m y f ather 
gave himself up.  He was takenby him self  with one policem an to Buchenwald 
concentration cam p, which was about 60
-
kilom eter
sf rom  our hom etown.
 
 
Af t e r
,  
I stayedat home for a while. T hentheschoolsopened up 
again in Frankfurt. And I went back to Frankfurt am  Maim.  My f ather got outof  the 

concentration cam paf ter four weeks.  My m other had sentm oney for a train ticket so he could 
com e back.
 
 
W hen he cam e back, he remarkedthat the situation, what 
happensthere, is just unbearable.  You cannot believe 
wh
at peoplecan do to other people; w
e 
have to getout of here.  Nom atter where we are going, don't wait for Am erica, just let's get out 

of  he r e .
 
 
W ell, when he came hom e, he couldn't stay home because we 
hadto leave the country.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Susan, that was one of the conditionsf or letting him  out.
 
>> SusanT aube:  Also, he was aW orldW arI veteran,f rom W orldW ar I
, f
ighting for the 
Germ an Arm y.

>> Bill Benson:  Kristallnacht, or the Night ofBrokenGlass, was Novem ber
 9  
--
 
10, 1938.  So 
we're now
 
probably in late1938, December.
 
>> SusanT aube:  He lef t.  Yeah. Sohe went over to the border to Belgium  with nothing on 
him . They had to paysom ebody to take him over there. Af tera while we f ound out thathe's 
saf e,but he had nom oney or anything.
  
But the Jewish com munity took care of the ref ugees.  
He wasn't theonly one who hadto leave. 
 

 
Af ter he was goneforabout two, threem onths, we got 
informationf rom Berlin that he should come to Berlinfor aphysical andbe ready to gethis 

papers to i
m m igrate to Am erica.
  
W ell, since he couldn't come back, the papers were sent to 
Belgium . Thatprolonged the whole processa lotof  tim e, six, eightm onthsor evenm ore. I 

don't know.  I don't rem em ber exactly.
 
 
Anyhow, he got out just
 
--
 
well, in the meantim e, the war started. 
T he war started. T hings changed again.  A lot of things changedagain.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Before we go onf rom  there, the war began with Germ any's invasion of Poland 

on September
 
1, 1939. W hen yourfather was in Belgium , you toldm ethat you would try to 
sendhim things because he had nom oney over there. T ell us about sending hima shoe.
 
>> SusanT aube:  First of all we bought postal stampsf rom thepostoff ice that he could cash 
in f or m oney in Belgium .
 
>> B ill B
enson:  And you couldn't send him  any m oney. T hat was illegal.  So you sent him 
st a mp s.  
>> SusanT aube:  Money was conf iscated right after Kristallnacht.

>> B ill B e n s o n :  Righ t .
 
>> SusanT aube: W ehad nom ore control over our assets. Everythi ng was conf
i s c at e d.   W e 
sentone shoe at atime sohe couldhave apair of  shoes. If  you sent a shirt, you had to take 
off  thebuttonsor som ething to send the shirtso it was dam aged goods and not new.  It was 
ver y tough.
 
>> Bill Benson:  I thinkyou said som etim es
 
you'd evenput in one sock.  Stuff  would get stolen 
and conf iscated
.  S
o no one would want oneshoe.
 
>> SusanT aube:  One shoe.  Anyhow, he got out.  His papers cam e to Belgium .  And he got 

out just bef oreGermany in vaded the lowlands.  He gotout in February of  1940.  In May 
Germ any invaded
 
--
 
>> Bill Benson:  In May
 
1940.
 
>> SusanT aube: 1940.  Germ any invaded Belgium  and France.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Hem ade itout to the UnitedStates.
 
>> SusanT aube:  Hem ade itouttoAmerica.  Yeah.  Yeah.  W e were in touch with him until 
Am erica went intothewar.  W e knew where he was.  Hefound work.  He gotpapersf orus.  
But then, again, Am erica went into the war.  Ever ything was shutout.
 
>> Bill Benson:  I thinkbef ore Am erica went to war your m otherm oved you and your sisterto 

Berlin tobe close to the U.S. consulate so that if  you were able to get the papers, you could go 
join your father.
 
>> SusanT aube: T hat wasn't theonly reason we m oved. W e were the last Jewish fam ily in 

that little town. T hey made it very, ver y diff icultf or m y mother to stay there
, v
ery diff icult. Very

d if f icu lt .
 
>> Bill Benson:  So then now your m other iswith just her two daughters living in Berlin.
 
>> SusanT aube:  My m other sold herhouse.  She didn't getany m oney for the house. 
 
T he  
m oney was also puton these accounts where you had no control over. W e receivedonly 
enough topay our rents, f ood,and a little bit like pocketm oney. T hat's all. T hat was 
governm ent 
controlled.  Everything was go ver nm ent controlled. W ehadto give up jewelry.  
Ever ything I had to give up.  Evenfur coats. W hen the war started,fur coats had to be 

delivered. 
 
 
W hen we m ovedto Berlin, we cam e to Berlin in 1939. At that 
tim ealready all small towns, som e Jewish population lef t these towns and mov
ed to bigger 
cities.  You just couldn't stay in the small towns anym ore.  So we cam e to Berlin.  Berlin, the 

Jewish com munity again took careof  thepeople who cam e inf rom  these little towns
, p r
ovided 
living quarters, etc.,for these people. 
 
 
Our new facility was in a house that belonged
 
--
 
the apartm ent 
belonged toa gentleman by the name of Frederick who was a correspondent to a Germ an 

newspaper at one tim e butalso lost his job in1935.  It was a nice apartm ent.  He hadone 
room . W e hada room privately.  And that was it. W e weref ourpeople.  My grandm other,m y 
m other,m y sister, m yself.
 
 
In Berlin, I think I went to schoolfor a little while but notf or very 
long.  By thattime I was 14 years old.  Andby 14 years you had to go to work.  It wasn't r
e a lly 
work.  T he war was on.

Let's go back.  Myf irst job when I came back to Berlin was an 
a ll
-
day
 
--
 
not only m e. I hadf riends there.W e had to take care of the elderly people because 
thenursesand caretakers who usedto take care of them had to wor k for the war
, t
he factories.  
And we as teenagers had to do their jobs.
  
So we did it. T he older people.  If they got sick or 
som ething happened to them , you know, they disappeared. They were taken out saying to 
hospitals, but we never saw them again.
 
 
So eventually this home closed up.  My next job was in a 
daycare center where, again, the parents hadto work.  They had to go to work in the 
m ornings. W e had to be there 6:00
 
in themorning to accept the children, receive the children.  
W e stayed until
 
the last child was taken home at 8:00
 
in theevening. W e went by public 
transportation there. And we took careof  thechildren. That was my jobfor quite a while.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And during that tim e, of course, the deportations ofJews began.
 
>> S u s a
nT aube:  Com ing to that.  Yeah. 
 
>> Bill Benson:  Ok. 
 
>> SusanT aube:  Deportation started. One of m yf riends who worked with me in the 
children's
 
--
 
in the daycare center, her parents lived notfarf rom us
.  V
ery nice people. T hey 
were originally f rom
 
Rom ania, but they lived therefor a long tim e.  One day they came to the 
house and just took them  away.  T hat's it. They were gone.
 
 
T he next came to the next person. Dueto circum stances we 
have tobring our citizens f rom  the east into the right.  And you will be resettled to theeast. Be 
ready on this and this tim e.  You can take with you whatever you can carry.  If you take any

bigger item s, you bring it toa certain place,and it will be shippedtoyour new destination.  
T hat was the message on the 
post.
 
 
W hen she left, I said goodbye to her.  I gaveher a 
s e lf
-
addressed stam ped envelope and said put it inthe mailbox, when you see one.W hen m y 
tim e comes,our tim e com es, m aybe we canf ind eachother again. 
W ell, th e y lef t. I ne ve r 
heard f rom her. 
 
 
Our time cam e in January. W e received the sam e inf orm ation. 
Be ready at thisand this time.  It was theendof  January
 
25th of January, to be ready.  It was 
the same inform ation.  And that's it.
 
 
In the m eantim
e,alsofrom  the children's home, where m y age 
wasn't 15, they tookme outf rom  thathom eand Ihad to work in thefactory where they m ade
 
--
 
receiving equipm ents for subm arines.  Again
, 
there we had to be there early in them orning, 
6:00, and worked until
 
about 7:00, 8:00
 
in theevening.  The Jewish people were sitting 
separatef rom  theother people. The Germ an people received lunches there, food.  And we 

had to bring our own f ood. 
 
 
Foodfor Jewish people atthat time was rationed.  Everything 
was rationed,actually, at that tim efor everybody.  Jewish peoplehad the coupons with the 

stamp on it.  You could only go to the store and buyf oodbetween4:00
 
and 6:00
 
in the 
af ternoon.  Not any other tim e.

T he Gestapo cam e toour place. W ell,m y mother, sheused to

andpans, andput it on the wagon. W ecarried

whatever the thing i

where it was supposed to go. This was origin ally a Jewish school which had a little, you know, 
what do you call it?  Like a

everything was left there.  Justput your name on it.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Likethe sewing m achine andall
 
o f  th a t?
 
>> SusanT aube:  Yeah.  Just put your nameon it. It will be delivered to your new destination.  
Never knowing where to.  So we lef t everything there. And in theevening they cam e. T he 
Gestapo came. Again, leave what you still have.  Gave the
 
receipt. And then lef t us enough 
m oney to take public transportation to the place of  concentration, which was a synagoguethat 

wasn't run down during Kristallnacht because it was between two houses
b
ut it was 
demolished on the inside.
 
 
Eventually in this
 
place came about 1,000 people.  I
t  wa s  ve r y 
hot.W e had the kna
psa ck
, little suitcases. W ehad put a lot of clothes on ourself . But we 
cam e tothis place. It becam e so hot that we had to strip ourselves.  So whatever. 
 
 
Saturday m orning we were called
 
by the Gestapo. T here were 
big tables there. T heycalled bench by bench, people were calleddown.  T hey told us, well, 
you have your ID, your kennkarte
.  A
ll passports were confiscated in1938.  Allpass
po r t s
 
were 
conf iscated. W e gota new ID which was
 
called a kennkarte. T here was a J on it.  And this 
kennkarte was taken awa y f rom usat thattime. W e were told we are getting anew ID, and

there were trucks there.  Very early in them orning. So 
thepublic shouldn't see it. They tooktheelderly people and who couldn't walk or whatever to 
the train station. W e walked. It was aboutf ive 
kilometer
s m aybe.  W e walked.  
 
 
W ecame to the train station in the suburb of Berlin and we 
lookedf or a train.T here was no train.  But the cars like you saw in the m useum. 
  
And through 
the 
ca ttle
 
cars, they opened the doors when ever ybody was there
, a
bout 80, 90 people.  On 
the sides were benches m adeoutof  straw.  And on thef loor was straw.  And on each sideof  
theend of the wagon was a bucketf or yourphysical needs.  Andthat was it.  Andonce 
ever ybody was in these trains,they were closedf rom  theoutside and off we went.
 
 
1942 was a very, ver y extrem ely cold winter.  T here was noheat 
in there. W ehad no water.  Only that little bitof f ood we still had from home. A
n d tha t wa s it. 
 
T he journey tookabout I think three day and three nights.  Idon't know exactl y.  But we cam e 

to Riga.  It was the end of January.  Probably 1929, 1930, som ething like that. W earrived in

wi re, doublefence of  chicken wires.  There was abig gate.  Soldiers standing there with guns.  
T hey told ustom arch in there. They showedus where to go,toa house. And into this 
house
 
--
 
I don't know how m any people they pushed. It was darkat that time, so we didn'tsee 
m uch anym ore.
 
 
So we sat down in thehouse. W aitedfor daylight to com e.  
Dayli ght cam e. W e looked around. And we saw f ood on the place, clothes laying around, stuff  

there.W e couldn'tf igure out whathappened there. Then we went out and we saw clothes 
outside, black spots in the snow, snow and ice.  Everything was ice.   Everything was f rozen 
there.  Couldn't f igure out what happened. 
 
 
Again, we stayed there for aday

until February

that house.  February

E ve r yt h

it to m e once as almost a surreal scene of  everything coated in 
ice in the house.

>> Bill Benson:  You just waited there.
 
>> SusanT aube:  Yeah.  If we went out, we

get out. T hey were assembling ina certain place. There were trucks staying there. The SS 
was there. T he dogs were there. T hey soldiered us out.  Old people, children,m others with 
children.  Mostly old peopleputonthetrucks. Among them , my grandm other.  Never to be 
seen again.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Susan, m indf ul that you still have a lotm ore totell us, tell usabout your tim e 

in Riga, what you were  forcedtodo,and then where you were sentfrom  there.
 
>> Susan T
aube: W ell,f irst of all, m yf eet weref rozen.  I couldn't even walk.  They got better 
af ter af ew days. T hen there was aman in charge of  the whole building.  T here were a lot of  
people in that one house.  He came to eachdoor and said, look, you have to go to work.  If  you 
wanted to eat, a piece of bread, youhave to go to work.
 
 
Som y f irst job was toshovel snow, rem ove the icef rom the 
sidewalks in the city of Riga. W em archedout of  the ghetto. W e always walked, walked, 
walked. W hile we were there, we got ice picks, shovels. W em oved the ice sothe peopleof  
the city could walk safely.
 
>> Bill Benson:  But you were notallowed
 
--
 
>> SusanT aube:  No.W e were not allowed to walk on that.W e had to walk in the street. 
From  Germ any, we also had already the Jewi sh star.W e had it sewn on our clothes.
 
 
So this lasted until it got warm er. T henI gota job with the 
Germ an Air Force, theheadquarters of the Germ an Air Forcefor the Russian Front was in 
Riga.  Andm y job was there to clean thehouse, wash laundry, help in the kitchen. They had 
these big ovens there that would heat a whole apartm ent.W e had to cleanout the ovens and 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
20
 
f ill them up again with wood and whatever.  
 
 
T his was actually a good job because I worked am ong the 
m ilit a ry,  a n d
 
I had to clean.  All Ihadfrom  the ghetto, we hadbed bugs and lice.W e didn't 
have any bathroom s to take showers or whatever.  So at that job when I came in in the 
m orning, they gave m e m aid's clothes. I had to take off m y oldones, takea bath, and go to 
work.  In theevening, I reverse.  Soactually this was a good job
 c
om paring to other things, 
what other people did. 
 
 
Food,I hada littlefood there.  So that was helpf ul to m y mother.  
T he rations they were giving in the ghetto was hardly anything.
  
If  you were lucky, we got a 
pieceof  horsem eat, bread.  Sometimes bread.  Sometimes rotten potatoes or rotten 
vegetables because at that time everything wasf rozen.
 
 
So anyhow, 
if  
they bring f ood inf rom  the workplace to the 
gh e tto
, i
t was ver y dangerous because on the wa y you could be searched.  If theyf ound 
anything on you, they could take you right tothe 
cemetery
 
andthat's it. T hat was the endof  
you.
 
 
T hat happenedtom eonce. Thank God they didn't catch me.  
But I had abig pieceof m eat onm e.
  
And Itried to hide it. I got through. T hank God,I got 
through.  Yeah. Ithappened that people gotshot,hang. 
 

>> Bill Benson:  Susan, eventually you would be taken som eplaceelse todig peat. T ellus 
about that.
 
>> SusanT aube:  In the sum mer of 1943 they took young people todig peatmoss, about

-
k ilo m et e r
s outside the Riga ghetto.  Peatm oss was usedfor burning, heating, burning, 
whatever they used itfor.
  
T here were m en. T hey had to dig the peatm oss outf rom the 
ground. There was awhole m achinery going on there.  It was thenputonplanks. T he planks 
were put on the conveyer belt.  From the conve yer belt we hadto carry the planksto a bitof  
m etal so they could dry up and turnthem aroundnow andthen. That was our jobf or white a 
wh i l
e.
 
 
W hen this was over, I went back to the ghetto.  Andm y new job 
was again workin g m ilitary.  T he Germ an soldiers going to andf rom  thef ront in Russia at their 
R&
R
.  S
obefore they went home, they were 
deloused
 
becausethey all had lice. And going 
ther
e, it was their last stop of entertainm ent, Iguess.
 
 
So this was, again, cleaning, helping the soldiers
, w
ashing their 
laundry.  Keepthe place clean. W hich wasn't, again, not toobad because soldiers wasn't like 

the SS. TheSS a little bit different pe
ople.
 
 
W ell, then cam e1943,the end of 1943. There were selections 
all thetim e, actually.  From  tim e to tim etheyfelt like killing Jews.  So they get together quite a 
few people.  Always select, soldier them outand took them  away.
 
 
W ehad two hospitals,also. T he people, if  they stayed m ore 
than afew days and didn't getbetter, they just took them away and that was it. 
 
 
W e wen t
 
--
 
they started the liquidation of theghetto.
 
Came 
Kaiserwald
.  T
he ghetto was liquidated.  Slowly, slo wl y, the young people, working people, 
were sent toKaiserwald.  Kaiserwald was alr eady like a real concentration camp. Bars, slight

clothing, and work. W e had work. W edidhave to work all the tim e. There was no way to stay 
back home to stay back in the ghetto. If  youdidn'thave a job and you weref oundhom efor no 
reason whatsoever, they could take you away and that was it.  Youalwa ys had to get outof  
th a t ghe tto.
 
 
W edid have afew chil dren still in the ghetto. Som epeople 
were lucky to save their children. W ehad a schoolfor a little while.  I mean, not a school. Just 

lik e
 
--
 
be carefulf orthe children. All were taken away eventually.  They were taken away.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Idon't want to slow you up because of the time,but you toldm ethat while in 

t h e  Rig
a ghetto, the Jewish com m unity did its bestto try tohave som e sense of normalcy
,  
to  
have a place of trying to educate the kidstothe extent you could. So you tried to hang on to 

som e sense of norm alcy.
 
>> SusanT aube:  Keep them occupied. T hechildren
 
were hungry
 w
hen we cam e hom e from  
work, and they were al ong thef ence begging.  
 
>> Bill Benson:  So then you go toKaiserwald and toa place calledMeteor. And you toldm e 
thatthe labor at Meteor was horrible. 
 
>> SusanT aube: W ell, I should say I was
 
lucky.  I was in Kaiserwal d only two weeks.  At that 
tim e I was separatedf rom m y m other. My m other was senttoone place with m y sister, and I 

was sent toanotherplace. W ehad no control over our lives whatsoever.

>> Bill Benson:  Pontoon boats.
 
>> SusanT aube:  Yeah. W hen they were shot
 
up, they came to this placetobe repaired. It 
was the dirty work the m en did. W e hadafew m en there. They cleaned them out f rom  
snakes, turtles, whatever was in these boats,collected in the river.  And then they cam e to the 
factory.  They had long tables there. They were putonthese tables. W ehad to glue them 
together again. 
 
 
T he glue was ver y dangerous.  It was a synthetic glue.  I don't 
know what it was m ade of
, b
ut people begancoughing.  So because it was an important job to 
do, tooka long tim eto teach thesepeople, they supplied somem ilk for the people who didthis 
job. 
 
 
I, m yself ,again have to consider m yself  lucky.  I andtwo other 
girls, these boats had to be painted beforethey went back intoaction.  So they came to abig 
room , very air y room  with windows and everyt hing.  And there theboats were painted. 
 
 
T he otheradvantage we had there, it was theoff iceof  the 
caretakerof  this place, and the engineer.  For some reasonthey lef tthe radio on. W esaw the 
newspapers. And we had
 
an idea what's going on around in the world.
  
Sof rom there we 
found out that Stalingrad was lost. The Germ ans areona successful retreat. T hat wasm usic 

to our ears. But the retreat didn't come quickenough.  It took until 1944, August
 
1944.  
 
 
T h e y 
cam e tous, theSS cam e. W ithout any warning, you have 
to go back to Kaiserwald.  Back toKaiserwald. W e were in Kaiserwa ldf or about a week. And 
the whole camp, whatwas still li ving there, was still alive thereaf tersorting out theoldones,

old people and peoplewho could not work anym ore.  Put on aboat in the harbor of Riga and 
shipped to concentration cam ps in Germ any.
 
 
On this boat, at that tim e, cam e also people f rom all of these 
little work cam ps around Riga.  They used the slave labor indiff erent capacities.  People were 
living on these workplaces.  Butat thattim e they all cam eto this boat.
 
>> Bill Benson:  So the Russians are dancing, taking
 
--
 
forcing all of  the Jews out of the 
cam ps. 
 
>> SusanT aube: T aking the evidence what they did th
ere. 
 
 
My best girlf riend who I knew f rom Berlin,her parents were also 
in a different work camp than she was.  Shewas with m e. They we re in a 
w
ork camp. W hen 
these people cam e in,she lookedfor her parents. Shef ound out that everybody over 30 
would 
not be allowed to com e to theboat. She never saw them again.
  
She got very 
depressed, actually. 
 
 
So the journey on that boat. T here were about 5,000, 6,000 
people on thatboat, standing up the whole tim e.  No toilet.  Nothing.  You couldn't go out in t
he  
air, nothing.  No water.  No f ood.
  
I think ittook two or three
 
--
 
Idon't know how long it took.  I 
don't remember. W earrived. W e disem barked. They putus on the m etal. And we didn't 

know where we are going.  W edidn't know anything was going to happen to us. And 
eventually they came. They cam e
 
--
 
coal andother things in. W e were pushed. W e couldn't 
stand up. W e couldonly sit down or crouch down. W e got out. W ecouldn't even recognize 

eachother.  Everybody was black.

Anyhow, we cam e to
 
Stutthoff .  Beautif ul flowers, beautiful lawn.  
A hundred yards in you saw thebarracks, you saw the gravel.  Youdidn't seeanything but this. 
 
W e were pushed inbarracks
, f
our up length to sleep on

ike sardines. T hat was it.
 
 
In the m ornings, about 4

O n eS S  gi r l  c a m e .  S he d idn ' t f i n d t he  r i gh t  n um ber .   
In them eantim e,they took thedirectory f rom  the barracks.  People died overnight. W e stood 
therefor hours som etim es just to be counted.  Rainor shine.  It was still August.  It was ver y 
h o t, a ctu
a lly.
  
And then they dism issed us. T hey ga ve us apieceof bread.  Something like 
coff ee. Andthat was ourfoodf orthe day until nighttim e. W e received a bowl off ood. If  you 

hada bowl.  If you didn't have a bowl, you were out of luck. 
  
 
And then in
 
the evening again 
a
p pe
l
l. T he sam ething all over 
again.  Forhours you stood. T hat's it.
  
And then we went intothebarracks andtried to sleep.  
But who could sleep? Nobody could sleep. W e weref our girls at that tim e.  I rem ember,we 
sneaked out of
 
thebarracks and laid inf ront of  som ething there. One of the girls, she smelled 
bread.  She said, you know, I sm ellbread.  I don't know what's here. Let's look. Sothe 

windo w was open.  Itwas the supply room for bread.  She went in.  She stole a loaf of  bread.  
Good thing she wasn'tcaught. So we had a piece of bread,anextra piece of  bread, toeat that 
day.
 
 
And this went on. W ewere theref orabout two weeks.  Luckily, 
luckily f or two weeks.
  
In the meantime, we saw e ver y day selections, people going by to the

crem atory.
   
 
In two weeks, we stood on appell. They counted out 500 
wom en. W e were am ong them . They were not telling usanything, just counted 500 women.  
Marchedus out of thecam p
 t
othe railroad station.  Real railroad cars this time. Putus onthe 
railroad car.  
H
ours later we cam etoa placecalled Sophienwalde,which was supposedto 
be
 
--
 
we were supposed tobuild a training cam pfor them ilitary there. T hey took down the 
t re
es. W ehad to takeout the woodsf rom the trees. Sothey could pave the roadsfor the 
heavy equipm ent or whatever they used there.  Andthat was our job.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Susan, one quick questionf or you.  I believe it was at Meteor, but youbecam e 

ve r y
 
close to a small gr oup of women. I thinkyou called them  lagaswi zer.  They were with you 
at thispoint.  You stayed close together.
 
>> SusanT aube:  Stayed close together. Only one is still alive.  So we were there in 
Sophienwalde. That's what our job was to take out the roots. I don'tknow what it was we had 
to push.T hey were on tracks. T o a certainplace we had to push them
, u
nload them .
 
>> Bill Benson: T he logs.
 
>> SusanT aube: T helogs, yeah.  Pushed them back. Filled them up again.  And that
 
wa s  
our job.  Food was, again, only a pieceof bread inthe morning.  Just bread.  Nothing else.W e 

hada water pum p there. The cam p was m ade of  little hutsf rom plywood.  And ineach hut 
were 15 wom en. Andon the f loor was just straw.  Nothing else, just straw.  And we each 
received two sm all, little blankets.  
 
 
So we were thef our girls, f our girls, kind of together.  So one 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

27
 
would put theblanketon the straw.  One we usedfor pillow.  And the two we used to cover us 
up. 
 
>> Bill Benson: T hatwinter
 
of 1944 to 1945was an extrem ely brutal winter.
 
>> SusanT aube:  It was brutal.
 
>> Bill Benson:  You would stay in those circum stances
 
--
 
>> SusanT aube:  No.W e didn't stay in these little huts. Af ter we f inishedf or the woods,we 
had to build the hous
es
, t
he housing.  Ibecam e a brick layer.  But then it got cold and we 
couldn't do either one anym ore so we were l aying around. But it got so coldeventually they 

took the whole camp and put them  inone of theseunf inished houses, in the basem ent. Again,
 
there was nof looror anything
, j
ust sand. But it was warm er than the huts. 
 
 
In this camp we had acomm andant who was in charge of the 
cam p.  He was oneof five brothers.  Four of them lostalready their lives during the war.  So I 

guess he got that job
 
as a com pensation.  I wouldn't say
 
--
 
he was hum an. A human person, 
as hum an as he was allowed to be.  He tried to
 
--
 
nottohelpus but to comfortus a bit
.  S o
 
when it got very cold
 
--
 
we had no clothes,our striped clothes, nothing else
, n
o clothes 
wh
atsoever.  He managed to getus sweaters f rom the people who were killed.  So each of the 
sweaters hada big red m arkon it
 s
o we would be recognized Godforbid when you run away.  
So that sweater when it got very cold, I wore oneonthe top and one on the
 
bo t t om  to  k eep

W e went on the Death 
March f irst f or 10 days. 
 
>> Bill Benson: T ell us about that. 
 
>> SusanT aube:  February.  February we we re assem bled. And the com mandant told us, 
look, the Russian Army is com ing closer
; 
I have to take you back to Stutthoff.  I have orders to 
take youback to Stutthoff . If  you can walk, you're welcom e to walk. If you cannot walk, stay 

here. Som ebody will t ake care of  you. 
  
W ell, we walked.  Somebody to take care of, we never 
saw them  again.
 
 
So we walked for 10 days.  Slow, rain, it was February, nasty, 
nasty weather.  At night, hef ound the bonf ires where we could stay overnight.  If  hef ound 

som ethingf orus to eat, we were luck y.  If not, we had nothing to eat.  So we pulled grass, 
whateve
r we could find we eat. 
 
 
W ecame to aplace called Lauenberg. T here was a camp
 
--
 
thereused tobea British POW 's, but they were also evacuated already.  I don't know wher e 
they tookthem .W e stayed theref orabout two weeks. 
 
 
T hen came March 9.  W e h
eard shooting very close by.  Again 
they came
 
f or
 
us.  You cannot stay here.  You cannot stay here. T he Russiansareonour 
heels.W e have to leave. 
 

 
So we m archedall night, allnight we m arched.  It was a rainy 
night.  A lot of people died along the way.  In them orning, they pushed us into abarn
, a
 
place 
called Chinov, full ofpeople already, dead, alive, anim als
, w
hatever.  They just pushed us in

29
 
there,and that's it.  Left us there. 
  
W e thought that's the endof  us, really. W e just sat down 
and we waited.  
 
 
So around 10:00
 
in the m orning we heard big, big, big boom s.  
T hey said, what's happening?  I said, they'reshooting at us.  But the doorsopened, andthe 
Russian Arm y was there.  So that was our point of  liberation.  So the Russian Arm y cam e.
  
W e 
went outof  thebarn looking around. There were the Germ an population ready to leave the 

place to go west because they were running awa y f rom the Russians. T hey go west.  They 
hadtheir wagons loaded.  So we went on the wagons looking forf ood.  Food was available.  
W hat Ifoundf irst was sauerkraut.  It was delicious. T hat I didn't die right thereand then,I 
don't know.  But I wasalive.  And I still like sauerkraut.  Yeah. 
 
 
W estayed around the whole day. W edidn'tknow what to do.  
W e couldn't
 
do anything.  So at night, some people, som eof  the girls went into theGerman 
houses.  But that wasn't a good idea. The soldiers, if  you were Jewi sh, not Jewish, they had 

theirf un. W e stayed in the night in thebarn. Next day cam ea Russian off icer. 
 
T old us, you 
cannot stay here. The war is still around here.  You cannot go west. You have to go east.
 
So he gave us a wagon
, a
 
horse
, a
 
Jewish m an who could handle the horse. W eall wenton 
the wagon.  
 
 
T hey took us toafarm , a Germ anf arm . W ehad to clear the 
f ields. T hat wasf or the Russiansnow. W e had to clear thef ieldsf rom thedebris and planted 

potatoes and whatever has to be done in thespring to make itf illed,whatever.  T hat was our 
jo b
f
oraboutfour weeks.  But we were not under the 
gun.  T hey cleaned us up.  They were 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

feeding us. W hen this job was f inished, we were takenby the Russians to aplace called 
Koszalin. W ar was still going on. T he war didn't end until May.  To a place calledKoszalin. 
T hey gave us an apartm ent there.
 
 
Our job was
 
--
 
the Germ an population had left f rom there.  They 
went west.  Clean out the houses where nobody was living anym ore. W hat wasn't nailedon 
the wall or whatever has to betaken outandput in a warehouse. This was shipped to Russia. 
 
 
F ro m  t h
isplace we got ourf irst wardrobe, actually, because we 
couldf ind some clothes thatf it us, eventually.  And we started to look a littlebit morehum an 
again. T he hair started growin g.  Our hair was shavedoff before we went to Stutthoff.W e 
were com pletely bald. But our hair started togro w back. W e started to look human a littlebit.
 
 
In Koszalin, like I said,we cleanedoutthe houses. But we didn't 
cookfor ourselves. T here was a kitchen. InRussia, they say
 
--
 
a ki tchenf or people, for the 
m il
itary who came into eat. T hey wantedtoeat. And we were assignedto the kitchen to eat 

there, too.
 
>> Bill Benson:  Likeam esshall alm ost.
 
>> SusanT aube:  Som ething.  But not thatbig.  Not thatbig.  Yeah. T hat
's where I m et m y 
husband.   My husband was a soldier in thePolish division of the Russian Army.  He was a 

m edic.  He came to Koszalin because there was abig warehouse ofm edication that the 
Germ ans hadthere.  He was taking care of ahospital notf arf rom there.  He cam efor 
m edication f or
 
thehospital.  He cam e to the kitchen, right across the kitchen there.  He came 
to the kitchen.  So the soldier who took care
 
--
 
he was f rom  Romania, a Jewish soldierf rom  

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT

Rom ania, told them  that there are survivors h ere and if he would like to meet them .
  
So he 
said, sure, why not?  One of our girls was ver y sick, actually.  So we tookhimthere right awa y.  
He put her in quarantine because she had a terrible rash. W edidn't know what it is.  But she 
survi ved.  She's still living.  But shehasAlzheim er'
s.  
 
So that'show we m et. Onething leads to another.
 
>> Bill Benson:  I'll interruptf or just a second. If  we had more tim e, you would actually hear 
the rest of her story about m eeting Hermanand how eventually in order toprotect them f rom  
the Russian
 
soldiers, quarantined all of them andthen through bribing with vodka and kielbasa 
was able totake Susan and get them  outof  there. They worked together in the hospital
.  The 
r
est is history, as you say.
 
 
Susan, two last things before we close the progr
am .  T ell us I 
think a remarkable story of how you located yourf ather. And then when did you learn about 
what happened to your sister and your mother? 
 
>> SusanT aube:  Oh.W hat happened tom y sister andm y m other?  Af ter the war, we found 

out what happ
ened.  Ikind of f igured
 
--
 
I came back toBerlin.  AndBerlin there was a Jewish 
hospital.  It was still active, actually.  And when the people cam eback, they registered there.  I 

couldn'tf ind their name anyplace. T hat was already alm ost a year later. 
 
So I kind of  f igured 
o u t. 
 
 
M y f a
ther, I found 
--
 
well, af ter the war, with m y husband 
already
, w
e were trave ling back andf orth back andf orth.  I had a letter prepared. Ifelt if  Ihad 
an opportunity, I will m ail that letter tom y father who
se 
address I kept inm y head the whole 

 
RO UGH  DRA FT  T RA NS CRI PT
 
NO T  A VE RB AT I M RE CO RD
 
32
 
tim e. And that letter was mailed to Am erica. But he never received it. 
  
Eventually, eventually 
we settled inPoland. Again, I wrote a letter to him, to the sam e address.  By that time the 
people, I guess, knew what was happening. T hey f oundm y f ather in the meantime. They 
forwarded the letter to him . That's how I gotattached with m y f ather. 
 
 
Af ter the war, when m y husband was dism issedf rom  the 
m ilitary, we went back to Poland.  He wantedto go back to the place
 
where he took care ofthe 
hospital andf igured we would, you know
 
--
 
the Polish people suffered also. W e weren'tthe 
only ones who suffered a lot.
  
 
 
W elived therefor about a year. It was really nice. But then 
cam e 1946, the survivors who cam e back toa city called K
ie lc e
, in the sam e houseabout40 
people. One day the Pols came. W edon't know who did it. Killedall of  them. 
  
So if this could 
happenaf ter what happened, wef igured there's nofuturefor us inPoland.  
 
 
T here were organizations already now.  Jewis h organizations 
were able totake people outf rom  there. W ewent f rom  therebackto St
ettin
.  It was aborder 
between eastand west.  And f rom  Stettin we were picked upf rom  military and taken to Berlin 
to a DP cam p in Berlin.  
 
 
B u t  in
 
Berlin we couldn't stay
 
--
 
couldn't stay either.  So we went 
f r om  Be r l i n  t o a  D P  cam p i n 
Z
ils h e im 
Œ  
Zeigenheim ,
 
that was closewhere m y father was born, 
actually where m y f ather camef rom . And while there, things werefalling already a little bit in 
plac
e. And since I was a Germ an Jewish citizen,born in Germ any, Jewish parents born in 
Germ any, they went back, 400 years back, Ireceived a small apartm ent ina place, in a Jewish

house thatusedtobea Jewish house but belonged now to a German wom an.  She
 
had to 
relinquish thetwo room s from  that house.W e were living there. Since I got in touch with m y 
father, he sent the papers.  Andf rom  there we went toAmerica.
 
>> Bill Benson:  And starteda rem arkable lif eaf ter that.
 
>> SusanT aube:  In 1947 in April we came to Am erica. And herewe are.
 
>> Bill Benson:  I'm  going to turn back toSusan in just a momenttoclose our program .
 
As you can see, we could have spent the rest of  theaf ternoon with you,and I wish we could
