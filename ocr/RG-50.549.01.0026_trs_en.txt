right now in m y home in Rockwell Center, where I have 
lived since 1948.
 
Q:Tellm e about whenyou were bornandthe town where you grew up?
 
A:I was born ina little villageby the nameof Forth, which is23 kilom eters northeast 

of Nu r em ber g.   I t ' s be twe

beeler (ph) had takenplace.  AndI lived,I wasborn in 
this village inJuly of 1913, shortly before the outbreakof W orldW ar I.  Andhardly 

got to know m y father because
 
he died, to some degree as a result ofW orldW ar I,

the town,the little villages around Nu
remberg had become centers of Jewish life 

when Nuremberg was not, I mean it was no longer permissible to live in Nuremberg.  

Nuremberg was one of the so

calledprincipalcitiesand it wasonly, I believe, in the 
m iddle of the 19
th
 
century or early 19

tury that the Jews were againallowed to

small villages.  W henI grew up, the village had atotal populationof probably 1,200

A:T hey wore swastikasandthey calledusdirty Jews, etceteras.  Now the Nazism 
in certainschools was so strong that it wasnecessary forthe Directorof the boardin

house tohaveme transferred toa schoolthat was less stigmatizedand 

coincidentally, the school f rom  which I had to be transferred was near the courthouse 

in Nuremberg where ultimately theW ar Crimes Trialstookplace.  It's, there are so

that was being put over the German people, Hitler's popularity began to shrink.  And 

there were two elections.  One was in thesummer of 1932andone was in thefall

Sem itism was enormously increased and this wasthe time whenalready Jewish 
stores werebeing pilferedordestroyed.  And itultimately led toa very important, 

personal incident.  On one of the visits in the m iddle of March to m y mother's house, 

I was hardlyathome, when there wasa knockon 
the  d oo r and  a  po l i cem a n,  t he l oc a l 

ge nd a rm e, cam e in toou r li vi n g ro om  a nd sa i d," M r . S c hna i tt a che r ,I  wou l d l i ke to se e 

you at the police station."  W hen I arrived at the police station, he very briskly told 

me that I was underarrest.  Andagain, it was
 
o ne  of  the se  p a inf u l , pai nf u l  m om en t s 
when I had to call upm y mother, whohada severecold,andIhad to tell her," Mother, 

I'm underarrest."  W ell, she was shrieking and she cam e storm ingout tothe police 

station protesting that aW ar widow should be
 
treated likethis without any reason 
whatsoever, butobviously it didnotdoany good.  My village was too small tohave 

a prisonof  it'sown and so I wastransportedtothe County seatof Earl

Q: Yes.  But I'm  curious about a couple of things.  One, was there, did you have 

anyhint when you were taken in, why youwere taken in?  Youwere living in 

Nurembergat the time that you werearrested in your hometown of Forth, is that

Q : H o w do es  th at happe n?  D id you ha ve  an y sen s e of
 
why?  How they would even 
have knownof you?
 
A: No.  I had no ideawhy I was beingarrested.  However,asI was turned over to 
the wardenof the prison,I requested information.  W hyI was here.  Andhethen, 

eitherthat nightor thefollowing morning, gavem ea slip ofpaper which indicated 

that I was arrestedbecause ofhavingagitatedagainst the National Socialist 

Government because of knowledge of secret ammunitiondepotsand liaison of illegal 

a nt i
-
Nazi organizations.  Now,actually, yes I was an ant
i-
Nazi.  Iwas no longer 
involved in anti
-
Naziactivities.  So the actual reason was toprovidethe local 
populaceof the villagewith adegree of satisfaction, tohavem e arrested as a Jew.  

And another cousinofm ine who was the only other youngmaleJew
 
i n t he vi ll a ge.  
A nd i t wa s qu it ea ne xp e r ie nc e.  A s I wa s give n th ee as i e st j ob in th ep r i so n, and 

that wastof ill, wedidn't have running water inthe cells,buteach oneofus would get 

a waterpitcher.  And it was m y jobtof ill the water basins that
 
weused to wash 
ourselves with.  Andtofill these pitchers with water.  And in doing so,Iturned 

a r ou nd and the r e s i ts m y cous in i n th e ad joini n g ce l l .  W el l we  had a  ve r yf r ie nd l y 

greeting,and surprising so.  Themoment thatI had gotten into prisonm
y m ot her  d i d 
not rest for a m inute and pursued every possible approach in order to have me 

liberated, as wellasm y cousin.  Andthenfollowed som e six weeks later and I was, 

which would make it the beginning of May, and, no, it made it the end of April.

A: Yes indeed.  There was m y mother, two spinster Aunts on m y father's side. 
There were two brothers of m y m other's who were m arried.  And one of them  had 

three children.  And m

did the following year. 
 
And stayed in Americaforover six months.  Thenbecause 
of  her love for her m other and the feeling of obligation that she had for her, she came 

back toGermany in order to take care ofhermother.  And it was then, only afterthe 

Crystalnaught (ph), afte

mother, and Uncles and Aunts and cousins, all ultimately were brought over here.  

So we were extremely fortunate that we didn't lose anybody in the Holocaust.
 
[ En d of  Si de 1 of  T ap e 1 ]
 
Q: It was th
at they hadn't lost anybody?
 
A: Right.  So this brings us up to 1939.  And when m y mother was the f irst mem ber

m y motherand grandmother, we lived in afive room apartment.  Andthen, when 
other Uncles and Aunts came, we justdoubledup.  There was neverany complaint.  

There wasonly theutmostof happiness,to have succeeded inbringing our relatives 

out of Germ any.  And even a
sfaras, which is of some signif icancewith regardto 

the question thathasbeen raised,the integration of refugees intoAmerican life.  

There wasan Auntof mine who then was inher late30's orearly 40's,and she didn't 

have any children.  And she and
 
h e r h usban d, th r ou gh ano the r  f r ie nd of  th e i rs , 
started to pull threads out of  pieces of  cloth in order to separate them .  And they 

started to do that in our dining room.  And from  there they developed a business 

where ultim ately they em ployed some forty p
eop le o n 2 6
th
 
Street and Broadway.  
And whenm y Uncle and Auntultimately died, they tookcareof their niecesand 

nephews, not having had any children of their own.  And that went for ever so many 

of thepeople, that no job was low enoughas long as they 
were able to sustain 

them selves.  W hether young wom en that worked inhouseholds, or infactory jobs, 

notwithstanding, verygoodeducations.  Andthis, I think, is oneof theunique 

aspects ofthis imm igration.
 
Q: CanI ask you,did yourm other and Unclesa

experience in Germany af ter youleft, in the years leadingup to thetimethat they

integration in American life, that this was alsotheperiod of the o

tothe role of the Republican government inf ighting Franco.  Andcertainly, 

ultimately, infighting Mussolini and Hitler.  And we participated inthe collect

in interrogating any of them.  
I just walked around toheartheir voices, to hear what

he saluted, and said, "Lieutenant, I come f rom  a village not far from here.  Couldn't 

you let m e go home?"  So I said, "
W h y,  whe r e do yo u com ef rom ?"   H e sa id , " I 
com ef rom  Forth."   Forth ism y village, where Iknew everybody.  W here Iknew 

every house num ber.  Wedidn'thave cobblestones, we only haddirtroads.  AndI 

said to him , "But you weren't born in Forth?"   He said

his pupils grew wider and wider, he said, " If Am erican Intelligence has all

A: And a few days later we took Schnaittacher, after which I'm  named.  And I visited 
in the cemetery where m yfather is buried.  Andthen two days later we took 

Nuremberg whereI wenttoschool.  And I interrogated the Commander of t

vicinity of Dachau.  Andultimately liberated Dachau.

A: From  the mom ent that I picked up the phone.  If I would have prepared myself in 
r a i s in g que s t ion s , I  coul d n 't ha ve  do ne be tt e r t
han the two people who weretalking 
to each other.  One, they were f rom  two German divisions, different divisions.  And 

oneof them gave information suchas, thatthey were leavingthefollowing day in 

ordertom ove in a certain direction giving coordinate

such coordinates.  A fuel depot at

such coordinates.  IfI really would have askedthese questions,I couldn't

only because of the inform ationthat we brought,butother informationas well, we 

were able to break through the Germ an lines and advance by over 35 kilometers or 

m iles.  Andfor thatI receivedthe Bronze Star.  And Fritzi received aBronze Star

Q:W hat was your experience w

people in your positionwould therehavebeen,of Germ an/Jewish refugees who were 

now part of the Am erican arm y?  W as it a common thing or was it sort of unusual?  

How did they treat you?

in prison andthe warden was still thesame.  AndI think he recognizedme.  And
