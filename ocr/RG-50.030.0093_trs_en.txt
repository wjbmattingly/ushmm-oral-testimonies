 BENO 
HELMER 
 
June 25, 1990
 
 
 
Q: OK. We 'r e on. Would you tell me  your name  please?  
 
A: It's Beno Helmer. 
 
Q: And where and when were you born?  
 
A: I was born August 21st, 1923, in Teplitz-Schönau [
Czech:
 Teplice-−anov]. It's in 
Czechoslovakia. Actually, it's in Sudetenland. 
You know, it's... And I come
 from a family of 
three children, my parents, my grandparents, bunch of aunts, uncles, lot of cousins. As a 
matter of fact, my mother's family--all of 
them--settled in Teplice-−anov after the First 

World Wa r. And my father was a poor refugee w
ho just happen to come to Teplice, just to 
look for a job. And fell in love with my mother. And the rest of this is history. 
 
Q: Tell me about Teplice. 
 
A: Teplice was a very good city. I mean, I grew 
up there; went to elementary school, went to 
high school there. And what's amazing about it 
is, I never encountered anti...antisemitism. I 
mean, I never knew, even... Matter of fact, I ne
ver even knew I was Jewish. Because I didn't 
know Judaism is a connotation with a religion, 
or anything else. So I was Jew by religion, 
but it was not part of my personality. And I must have been, ma ybe, 11 or 12 years old and 
my best friend ... His name is--I shan't  forget--h
is name  was Egon. And as we playing in our 
backyard... Because I...my father build me  cages
 for rabbits. And I had so ma ny rabbits. So 
during this play-thing, or whatever it was, he sa
ys to me, "Beno, my father says this you are 
Jewish. Are you Jewish? "   And I said to him, "I
 don't know."  Because I never realized, as he 
asked my religious affiliation, or it was a part 
of a playing thing. And is the last time I saw 
Egon. And never saw Egon since; and he was 
a very good friend of mi ne. And I always 
asked my parents what is the reason, how come
 I didn't see Egon. They never told me why. 
And I lost Egon. And this was...and as a childhood was quite a good one until it was getting 
bad. And college, I couldn't go to anymore; so I went to Budapest. 
 
Q: Tell us about Budapest, and what you did there as a young ma n. 
 
A: At...at Budapest, this was at that time the cap
ital. It was almost like Paris, you know. It was a 
very lively, very vivacious city. Not for 
me , because...uh...financially, I couldn't afford 
anything else. But it was fairly good to me. 
Even in poverty, it was fairly good enough. And 
through...I don't know...circumstances, I got a job in 
the movies. I played in extras. I met S. 
S. Cuddles
. I think here in America, 
they called him S. S. Cuddles
. Actually, his name is S. 
S. Sagal
. I ma de two movies with him...with him;  
and a actress at that time which was very, 
very popular in Europe--[Barsa Nirosi (ph)]
. By the way, the reason also I got the job is 
because I was at that time bilingual. So the movi
es, at that time, were made in Hungarian and 
in German. So I could speak both languages. So
 when we took one take, I didn't have to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0093 
2
 
 
change roles. I could stay in the same role 
for the German take and for the Hungarian take. 
And...and plus we played with Hans Virbis (ph)
. He's supposed to ma ke a picture with 
Martha Eggar
, except at that time she fell in l
ove with Jan Kippur. And she came to 
America, and she left the Jan Kippur in America. And...and this was my youth, 'til my 
parents came...also came to Hungary; and it was getting... because Czechoslovakia became 
very unpleasant at that time.  And...uh... 
 
Q: What was happening to your parents?  
 
A: Uh...My parents came and tried to settle in..i
n Hungary. They felt this ma ybe in Hungarian, 
because at that time Horthy was more fascistic
. So they felt that maybe Hitler's gonna spare 
Hungary. And plus, my father had a older br
other living in Hungary. And he couldn't get 
any...in that between Hungary and Czechoslovaki
a, it was not very pleasant circumstances. 
There were already talking about war rumb
ling. So...uh...it was very rough, and my father 
couldn't get the papers to, uh...couldn't get papers
 to become a citizen or...or allowed to be 
stayed...allowed to stay there. So, through some  acquaintances, my mother knew Mr. Beck
. I 
think...I think Beck
 was at that time Foreign Minister of Hungary.
1
 And she went to his 
office, and she bribed him quite--I don't know, 
let's call it bribe--when she gave him a 
tremendous amount of money. At that time, this 
was a big money for us; because it's all what 
my parents almost had. And after this, she gets 
an invitation and my father gets an invitation 
to a dinner which is in honor of Mr. Beck
. So they were very elated, because they thought 
this gonna be the chance that he'd  finally...he'd
 gonna give a...the papers which they needed 
to stay in Hungary. So during the conversati
on... During this dinner, he knocked on the glass; 
and he says, "I have another question to ask. I 
want to ask Mr. Helmer how come  he gave me  
this tremendous amount of money."  So it's a good 
thing that my father said, "I'm giving it to 
the Hungarian Red Cross."  And with this sent
ence, he lost all his money. Because Mr. Beck
 
didn't take the money. The Hungarian Red Cr
oss got the money. And my parents were 
deported. And it was my parents, my brother 
and my sister; and they were deported to 
Poland. Because they had a chance to go to Czechoslovakia. You had a chance to go to any 

border they choose; and they choose Poland. A
nd shortly after this, I was deported also. 
Matter of fact, I shall never 
forget; I came home from a movie which I saw--Modern Times
, 
with Charlie Chaplin. This was the movie I 
saw. And I came home; and they woke me  up 
during the night and arrested me. And they 
deported me  to Poland. And I wound up in the 
city of _ód_. Always almost exactly the Friday before the war. And before the war. So we 

stayed in somebody's apartment. I don't know w
ho it was, where it was apartment. By that 
time, the German war started. I think it's October 1st, 1939.
2
 The occupation was immediate. 
We  couldn't escape anyplace, anyways. And, uh...b
ecause of financial difficulties, at that 
time was nothing left. So...because a lot of 
people escaped. So we found a place in _ód_ 
on...in a attic. Matter of fact, it was...the attic was so low that I don't think we ever... 
 
Q: I'm sorry. I can't  hear you.

A: The attic was very low. This was on the roof, underneath the roof; so we couldn't even stand 
up. So we only could stand up where the pitchw
ork came  together. Otherwise, we always 
had to hunch over. And it was...the whole r
oom consisted of one double bed and a big 
basket--like, uh...like a steamer trunk. And this where...all our possessions were in this 
steamer trunk; and that's the place where I slept.
 Because all four of them slept in this bed. 
And just when the ghetto was formed, this was part of the ghetto. This attic was part of the 

ghetto, _ód_ ghetto. So we didn't have to move
. We  stayed there, which was uh dire 
circumstances. No toilet, which was four stor
y down in...in the yard. No water, which we 
had to carry in pails all the way up to...four flights.  Bed chambers [
NB:
 chamber pots] at 
night time, and emptying. It was horrible circumstances. And couple of weeks after, my 

father was arrested. No, I'm...I'm... I have to re
tract. I have to retract a little bit. Before we 
went in a ghetto, before the Germans came, my 
father went back to Czechoslovakia. And he 
was joined the underground in Czechoslovakia; 
and got himself a job 
through his brother-in-
law, through my uncle, in an insurance co
mpany. In a big insurance company. And he 
changed his name . He got papers. His name  
was Pollack. Mr. Pollack, a widower with two 
children. And he...he was quite active in the 
underground. In one of the newsletters--the 
office newsletters--there was a letter written as...as
...a letter to the newspaper, or a letter to 
the editor. It says, "How come there is a 
ma n here with allegedly two...a widower with 
alleged two children, but we feel he's here unde
r different circumstances? "  So he felt this 
letter was written about him. So he packed 
up; and through the underground he... They gave 
him money to smuggle it out of Hungary, to br
ing it to...to smuggle it out of Czechoslovakia. 
 
Q: I'm sorry. Smuggling what?  
 
A: Money. Cash for the underground, to be...underg
round in Poland. So they gave him money. 
So he got money belts around him and he... Plus
 the shoes. The shoes was...instead of 
leather, the...they stuff--all the big denominati
ons they stuffed in in the shoes. And plus, 
wherever they could, they taped money to hi
m. And they smuggled him to back to Poland. 
Except, on the border they caught him. And 
they caught him...and not only... This was not 
the German who caught him;   it was the Polis
h who caught him. They took all his money 
away. Everything take his money away from hi
m. Only thing they didn't find was the money 
in his shoes. And they sent him back to Ge
rmany. So when he was back in Germany, he 
smuggled himself back--finally lucky--back t
o...to Poland. Because of this...all this walking 
what he did, he rubbed his soles through. And ma
tter of fact, the cash he had had holes in it 

because of...of the walking. So, actually, the mone
y was...was worthless, or much less worth 
than it was supposed to be. And he stayed in
 the city of Krak...uh, Kraków. And after this, 
there was a struggle between the fraction [
NB: 
faction] of the underground; between the 
Russian fraction and the English fraction. So 
anyways he came and joined us in _ód_. And 
this where finally the war caught on. 
We  wind up in the ghetto, which was 28 
Francziskanska Ulica
. 
 
Q: Tell us about...tell us about life in the ghetto, 
in addition to the attic. What was your daily life 
like?

A: Now, our daily life was...uh... I mean, the daily
 life was...uh...the daily life was--not only us 
and everybody else--was to...to find food. The str uggle was to find food; because we were 
constantly hungry. I mean, hunger was the pri...primary requisite just of survival. And...and 
the only thing...I mean, to compensate hunger, we
 were drinking water. I mean, water's fine, 
fills the stomach; but you're still hungry. So Fath
er got a job to supply groceries. You know, 
whatever was there, to certain outlets whic
h was giving the...the...which were giving out. 
So...so sometime he gets a little bit more flour; 
because that's all what he was delivering--
fl our. So we had a little bit more fl our; so Moth
er used to make a paste and make something 
like a Matzah or something out of it. I don't know 
what she did about it. I left quite early in 
1941. I already got a job...or 1942, I got a 
job from a ma n--name is Goodman
. And he got 
me a job outside of the ghetto. 
I was working for...for...for the Germans. So what was...I was 
working in a...because I was studying architectur
e. So they needed some  kind of building, 
the Germans. So they took a forced labor out 
of the ghetto, so we should work in the...in 
the...in the construction there. Since I ha
d a so-called background of two days, so...so 
(laughing) so they made me in charge of it.
 But what's only good about it was this:  they 
gave us a half a loaf of bread comi ng home. So we
 sustained ourself, at least, with this half a 
loaf of bread. Mother sliced...sliced it very 
thinly, or she ma de bread...uh...soup out of it. She 
boiled water and put the bread in it; and that's 
all what we had. It's bread soup. Except it was 
expanded so much, it became more filling. And it 
was...I me an, uh...plus I mean that what's 
bad about it was is also bodies...lot of bodies
 all over. Wherever you went, you saw bodies 
dying. And it's become s part of it. You know, [the
] first two, three or four, you find them as a 
shock. But later, you find them...it's...you gets quite 
used to them. It's...it's...it's like part of 
your nature. I mean, you just see a body and you 
disassociate yourself completely from it. 
It's...it's...it's...it's completely somebody else. It's...it's has nothing to do with you.  Filth was 

also tremendous. Filth. It was filthy. It was filth
 even the building where we lived. I mean, in 
the winter time. I mean, the toilet was...it was...
it was ice. It was all ice; and then the feces 
and the urine all over. Was overflowing...overf
lowing there. And...and some time, they took 
you to forced labor. I mean, one incident ha
ppened. They...they took us into a home. The 
German came and they...they lined everybody up. They lined everybody up. And there 
was...you know this was like in a semi -circle. Y
ou were standing in a semi -circle; and there 
was a lady there with a child. And, uh...(deep sigh)  (deep sigh)  And he ask, "Whose, this 
child? "   And the woma n who was the mother, 
she did not admit the child. So he took the 
child by the legs, and he swung it against the wa
ll. And he killed the child. And I looked at 
the mother; and it was like somebody else's. It wasn
't  her child. She completely cut this child 
off...out of her emotions. She cut this child off 
completely away. And I realized at that time 
the self-survivals is of most...more primary in
 your life. It's more than...than even your own 
child! And this was just terrible. So this was 
one of the experiences. I got a job aft...also to 
empty cesspools. Because they used this as fe
rtilizers at that time. So to empty a cesspool, 
they gave me a job. They gave me a pot--a
 cooking pot. And this is how I was emptying 
cesspools. In front, went into the hole up to th
e waist, whatever; how you stayed in it. And, 
uh...you emptied it into a bucket. And later, two men took the bucket and emptied it in those 
containers--metal containers. This was one of 
the jobs they gave us. I was...I had a job 
cutting roots out of...you know, they'd be cutti
ng down trees and...and excavating the roots. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0093

And I think they made camphor out of it. I 
don't know; some  kind of chemicals they ma de 
out of it. So they gave us ax...ax and shovels. A
nd it's very hard to dig a tree. So if you didn't 
do it, we got a hit a few times. You know, it s
eems they had a quota. We  had to do a quota. 
So this was one of the more pleasantness th
ing of the ghetto. So this was it. Wa s only 
survival. My father was getting weaker and 
weaker. And once in a while they came down, 
they closed off the building.  They closed o
ff the block. And they took the me n or wome n; 
and if the people looked sick, unhealthy, as they ju
st took them away. To regress, before they 
go...close...closed the ghetto, my father's youngest 
brother went also to Poland. Because my 
father was there, so thought he gonna be there.
 And he decide, when the German marched in, 
this he gonna escape toward Russia. So had a...a horse and buggy, or horse and carriage or 
some thing. To see his wife and two children
--my cousin Lisa and the boy. Went towards 
Russia; and they froze to death in...in the...in the [Bergen (ph)]
. We  just found it out by 
coincident. Matter of fact, we... Not true. 
I found it out after the war; because somebody 
knew them. This they froze to death, just to...it was so cold, it was bitter cold. And...and it 
seems like they fell asleep, and they never w
oke up. And on the ghetto again, so this was the 
job. So finally I got 
a job through Mr. Goodman
; and I me t some body in the underground. A 
French lady. I never knew her second name . Her name  was [Renée (ph)]
, or actually we 
called her "Renya."  And she got me  a job w
ith a German family. And I got a job not far 
from _ód_. I went to  Cz_stochowa, which 
is where they have uh the Black Marie.
3
 It's the 
seat, I think, of the Cardinal's seat there. They have the Matka [Mosca (ph)]
. Matka...yah, 
Matka [Mosca (ph)]
. And I got a job. And I got a job as a German in Entlösung Amtstadt 
[
Ger:
 "State Redemption Office"]. Entlösung Am
tstadt is the uniforms which came back 
from...from the front--which were dirty, filt
hy, had to be cut. You know, repaired or 
something else. They came to this Entlösung Amtstadt, where they were repaired, sewn, 

cleaned and sent back to the front. My job was 
to see the divisions where they came from. So 
when I gave to Renya the numbers I saw--
you know, I saw 70 uniforms from the 31st Panzer 
Division; I saw 20 uniforms from this and 
this division--what happened is, they knew 
approximately proportionately how many sold
iers get injured or how many soldiers 
exchange uniform. They knew approxima tel
y...uh, approxima tely how ma ny divisions, how 
many soldiers are in a particular front. And I...I was with the job quite some time. And it's 

became quite, you know, finally you...you're acclim
atized. You settled; the milieu became 
yours. You became the German. You became the milieu. Like as a German. I was thinking 

as a German. And we had the head of the char
ge was there; his name  was [Frombuloff (ph)]
. 
He was nobility. And only thing, funny thing, is I speak German. But wherever I was in 
Germany, I always spoke with the wrong accent. 
So I never been in...from the right Germany 
where they wanted to be. I was there, I was Ausdeutschland. If I was...I was in Munich, I 
was a Berliner. If I was in Be
rlin, I was from Hannover. I never spoke the right accent to suit 
those people. But anyways, I was there; a
nd it's became quite good. And I sitting there one 
lunch time... Lunch time, you know, and whatever they gave me --and they...being SS 

Ausdeutsch, I got little bit food from...from what
ever they gave me . And the Germans gave 
me  food there...the workers there, some  of them. So I...I don't know, it was some  kind of 

conversation. I said to him, "Das ist der 
Hund begraben."  Which is..."Das ist der Hund

begraben," means--like you say, you know, "the
 crux of it."  You...or, you know, this is 
a...you know, like he's gonna say there's a "Hund 
begraben"  like "here is a dog buried," 
actually; but in German, means you know
, uh...uh, like...uh... What is it?  "Das Hund 
begraben," is "here's a dog buried"... Is lik
e, you know, "You hit the nail on the head." 
Something like this. Like you hit the nail on th
e head. And he says to me , "You know, it's 
very funny. I never heard this in my life time. It
's the only time I heard this saying before was 
from a Jew."  So I said...(laughing)  So it b
ecame quite, quite uncomfortable (laughing) for 
me . So I thought, "My God, now he associates
 me . Because of this one sentence, he 
associates me with a Jew!"  But...uh...it's cam
e over. And...and later this woma n,  Renya... 
This matter of fact, everybody says, he's 
some body from the underground, or some body does 
a little spying, it's very exotic. It's not. I only knew this Renya. This woma n Renya. This was 
my only contact I ever had. You know, I 
me t some ...I me t some , uh...people who were 
dropped from England; but I only met them 
on...on a one-to-one basis. Because we..I did 
some sabotage work also. I became an expert 
in derailing trains. In 19...uh, at that time, the 
trains--I mean, the axle--I don't know [if] they didn'
t have ball bearings or if they had ball 
bearings outside the...the where the axle was 
and the wheel was. There's a housing. And this 
housing was threads--like rags or something. And 
those rags had a lot of oil in it. And this 
was grease...greasing the axles. So I became an expert as taking out...opening this little 
housing, this...and with one swoosh, taking out the 
oil in those rags. But you had to be very 

careful there shouldn't have any droppings on the 
railroad...railroad ties, or pebbles there. So 
you had to make sure that the oil should not 
drip on those pebbles; because they would see 
some body did some thing to it. So the whole idea was to swoosh it out and throw it away, but 

there shouldn't be oil...any oil should be left
 on it, on those pebbles. So I became quite 
proficient in this...uh, this endeavor, whicheve
r, which I was doing.  And what happened is 
that as the train was running, the train froze, 
the wheel froze, and the train was derailed. I 
never saw it derailed myself, but we know the c
onsequences of my doing that. And I stayed 
there for quite some time. A
nd once I found out that my father was getting very sick. My 
father was very sick; and so I got back to
 the ghetto, eventually. No! One more...a funny 
incidents I had. I lived in the city of Cz_s
tochowa, and I'm walking up to this Polish--
allegedly Polish--family who was...where I was staying with this Polish family. Walking 
down; and I had a...a open shirt, and I had a big 
cross. I wore a big black cross. It looked like 
a ebony, but it actually was out of wood. And just
 as a coincident, I walk up the hill and 
there's very few people on...on the street. And th
ere's a man walking down the street, on the 
other side...on the other side of the street. He 
looks at me , points to me  and says, "Parszywy 
_idje!" [
Pol:
 "Lousy Jew!"]  Says to me, "Smelly Je
w!"  From...I don't know what it was, but 
it is... I mean, it's the most amazing thing or he 
knew or he smelled it or whatever it was. But 
he says to me, "Parszywy _idje!"  This was 
also my...my little endeavor in Cz_stochowa. So 
anyway, I went back to...to--that time was Litzmannstadt [
NB:
 _ód_]. They rename d it 
Litzmannstadt. 
 
Q: Astreet?  
 
A: Litzmannstadt became _ód_. _ód_ became Litzmannstadt. _ód_ became Litzmannstadt. And 
I brought back some  funny...I had an opportun
ity. I brought a...smuggled myself...not me, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0093

but through these people. And I brought some  horse
meat to my father, so at least it was a 
little longer. And he needed some injecti
on. I brought him some  kind of an injection. 
And...but it was getting...he was getting weaker and weaker. So ma tter of fact, once they cut 

off the street and I had to take my father... In
stead of upstairs where we lived in the attic, 
some body allowed us to use the ground floor apar
tment. And we lifted off the flooring, and 
we hid my father--or at that time, our father--
under the floor. So when they inspected us, we 
looked much quite much healthier than he looked. So that we were spared. Because all those 

people who looked sickly or...or didn't look we
ll enough, they took them away immediately. 
And this way, every time, every day, we...we postponed the inevitable. And... 
 
Q: How long did... Slow down a little bit.  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: How long was your father under the floorboards. 
 
A: Oh, he was there for quite a few hours, becau
se we had to wait 'til they come. Because we 
knew the whole neighborhood was closed off. S
o...uh, we had to wait 'til they went from 
house to house to house to house to apartment to ap
artment, to search for...for sick people, 
whatever it was. So he was there the whol
e morning; if not much, much longer. And...uh, 
and he was scared. We  were scared that, you 
know, he shouldn't any noise; or when he steps 
on it, it shouldn't make a different squeaki
ng noise...a different squeaking noise... noise 
than...than the floor would ma ke. So, uh...we save
d him 'til...um, 'til eventually all of us 
winded up in...in Auschwitz. But..but it was...so 
it was quite rough at that time. So...so the 
circum...not only this, but a lot of... There wa
s also a...you know, they had their own police 
departme nt in..in the ghetto at that time. Uh, Rumpow... Rumkowski was the head of the 

ghetto. He was not liked at all. He was not
 liked on; but I have no idea under circum...under 
those circumstances, anybody else would do bette
r or worse. Every...every week or every 
day... No...no, not every week. Every day or ever
y two days, always transports went...went 
out...out of _ód_ ghetto, under the heading that th
ey'r e going to labor camp. And ma tter of 
fact, the propaganda was quite good; b
ecause nobody came back to complain. 
So...uh...it's...everybody toyed with the idea [that]
 maybe it's a good idea; because they told 
you you're allowed to take clothing, you're a
llowed to take whatever you want, and you 
take...take your sewing machine. Because you're
 going to go a labor camp, where they'r e 
gonna feed you and everything else. And a lot 
of them who came from Theresienstadt [
NB: 
Terezín] at that time... In the beginning, Theres
ienstadt, Czechoslovakia, wasn't  a very, very 
bad camp. So they felt that's going to be at l
east as good as Theresienstadt, it wasn't  going to 
be too bad. So even a lot of them volunt
eered to go away in labor. Because the 
circumstances were...were just unbelievable. Unb
earable. Especially for my parents and my 

sister and my brother. The winters were...were 
excruciating. I mean, the cold is unbelievable. 
It's freezing constantly. I mean, they slept clot
hing...with the clothing; and when I was there, 
it was the same thing. In one bed, just to k
eep ourself warm. And getting up in the morning 
was the same ordeal as going to sleep at nighttime. So it was bad thing; until...until...'til 
fi nally the transport, we were part of it. 
We  went to Auschwitz. I could have escape

Auschwitz. I could have escaped going to Auschwitz, because I could've be...be back in 
Cz_stochowa. Except I didn't want to leave my parents alone. And I fell under the same 
mi sconception, that...uh... we'r e going to some thing better. So if we go some thing better, I 
wanted to be with them. Especially, I felt, 
my father was very, very sick. Some body had to 
take care of my mother, and my brother and si
ster. So I...I...I...I didn't mi nd to go. They...they 
tried to talk me out of it. Ma
tter of fact, he...even Mr. Goodman
 tried to talk me out of it. But 
I didn't want to do it. I wanted to go with them. 
 
Q: Had you been doing work for the underground while you were in _ód_?  
 
A: _ód_--in the city of _ód_?  No. In the 
city of _ód_, I was not doing the underground. I 
was...uh, they had a little farm. All the way out
side the city of _ód_. And I only worked on 
this farm. It was an experiment in potato 
farming, you know. It just was...I only worked... I 
worked on this farm only because the borde
r was not far from this farm--the border 
of...outside of...of the _ód_ ghetto, or the Litzma nnstadt ghetto. So the guards saw me  
working on...on the farm. So when I went closer 
to the fence, they didn't shoot. They knew 
me . So they knew me , I was one of the farmers.
 So it was always a safe route for me  to go 
out and come  in. Except when I smuggled myse
lf out, I did it also nobody [outside] of my 
family witness I was going out. Because you 
never knew who..who you were working with. 
And the same  thing comi ng back. So...so when I went out--and that was always whoever we 
found we had go some wheres else, I had to go see 
my parents; and I was on this farm only to 
get out...smuggle myself out of....of the ghetto, and comi ng in. So that's how it was.  
 
Q: Tell me  now, if you would, about that...the 
deportation. The train ride. How...?  You were 
together with your family?  
 
A: Yes. We  went there...we went on a train 
ride. I think it was cattle farm...uh... Cattle trains, 
you know. And...and they took everything--all 
our belongings, which was very little; 
because we started...matter of fact we started the ghetto with very little. And I don't know... 

Did I tell you this?  My father was arrested and got bitten by a dog. 
 
Q: No. 
 
A: Let's go regress. 
 
Q: Tellus. 
 
A: Before they closed the ghetto, since we were
 foreigners in Poland, my father was arrested. 
Arrested by the Germans. So...uh...so seems likes 
that my mother...seems like a perpetual job 
to pay people off. Uh...Whatever we had left at
 that time in...we sold whatever we have--her 
jewelry, everything--was sold to get some 
money. And my father was released. He was 
released after a week or something. After a tim
e;  it was a week or 
two weeks. And the day 
of his release, the day of his waiting...we're 
waiting by the fence, my father should come  
with us. He was in the building where he was incarcerated. But there was a fence in front of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0093

it. But going fr om the exit of the building 
to the fence where we were staying [
NB:
 
standing], they sent...they pushed...they put th
e dog on him. And the dog bit him through his 
hand. This was his...his goodbye gift. Matter of 
fact, since then I'm scared of dogs. Uh, 
because they bit him right through his hand. This
 was...this was prior, before they even 
closed the ghetto. Yah. So now going to...to th
e ghetto...eh, going to Auschwitz, we were in 
a...in a...in a cattle--those things. Except, you know, 
if you were the first or second or third or 
20th or 30th into the cattle [car], it wasn't  as
 bad. But more and more people were pushed in, 
more and more depressed you became. More 
and more you knew that you did a bad choice; 
because you found out they'r e stop being humans.
 They'r e already started treating us as 
cattle. Even at the train where they promised
 us we going to go to...to Utopia or some place 
else. So it was getting very bad; but there 
was nothing we can do. We  had no toilet. There 
was nothing else. There was no food. And the 
stench became unbearable. I mean, natural 
stench. And we stayed in until we got to 
Auschwitz. Got to Auschwitz... So was getting 
rough already, because it was bewildering. All of sudden, it's comi ng from the dark... 
dark...dark...uh, cattle--the wagon, whatever it's wa
s called. You know, and they put us in 
lines...put us in lines. And then was my...(deep si
gh)  (deep sigh)  They put us all together. 
And they separated us. And I didn't want to 
leave my mother. (Deep sigh)  So, I...(Long 
pause)  (Deep sigh)  [(Crying)  Can we stop?  (Crying) 
 
Q: It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.] [

ght. We 're back on camera. Just 
tell us about the selection as best you can. 
 
Q: Yah. So there was...uh, there was...uh...uh, they se
parate us. All the family went together. 
And at that time, I had the honor to meet 
Dr. Mengele--which happens to be a very good 
looking man. He was impeccably built, and impeccably dressed. And he separated us. 

And...and it was...he had a whip in his hand. I th
ink he had a whip, or some thing. Yes, he 
had a whip; and he just motioned it left a
nd right, and left and right. And it's quite 
bewildering. So he motioned to me , "Right."  
My father, my mother and my brother, he 
motioned left. What he did to my sister, I didn'
t see. I just didn't see. And after this, we...we 
separated; and this was the last time I saw of
 them. And we went...got to a camp, where they 
shaved us. Hair, genitals and everything else. 
Took everything away from us. And they gave 
us some  kind of cotton uniform, which was a c
oncentration camp uniform. And they sent us 

to a camp--which was camp D.

 And the billowing smoke, you saw all the time; and it's 
became so pessimi stic about it. You know, as
 you start wonder what'r e you doing?  What you 
doing?  Says, "Is there any hope? "   And you spoke
 to those old timers. Old timers--which 
maybe they'r e there a week or two, or maybe 
just a few hours before you. But they already 
considered themselves experts. So they says, "You see those chimneys?  This where you 
wind up."  And it amazed me--  you took it nonc
halantly. It was nothing...nothing shattering. 
It was nothing. Even, matter of fact, it seems 
like a relief. Because it was enough already. It 
was enough. And...uh, was no big deal
. No big deal. It only changed... changed the scenery, 
but didn't change the suffering. And...and I...I...I am
azed is, I never cried after my parents. I

never mi ssed them somewhere. I never...never 
knew what happened to them anyways; but 
it...it was completely bewildering. It's like 
another party, or another body, was in me. 
It's...it's...it's... All of a sudden, I didn't care if I 
survived. I didn't care if I didn't survive. Just a 
zombie. Living as a zombie. And finally I got to a camp...to a camp...barrack 27D. Camp D. 
And we had--I don't know if the day or
 next day--it was, we staying [
NB:
 standing] for 
reveille in the morning. And the German comma
nder of this barrack--which was a Nazi in 
itself. And he only wind up in camp for the reas
on is this:  he was against Hitler making a 
pact with Stalin. So he became a little too vocal
 against Hitler, because he was more of a 
Nazi that Hitler himself at that particular tim
e. And that's the reason they put him in the 
concen...in this camp. But he was...he had... 
You know, I don't know. He had it... Okay, he 
survived it enough-- because he had enough food, whatever he wanted--and he came in and 
out. So he was quite a big shot at that time. 
He was not a completely sane person. Matter of 
fact, his...his...his achieveme nt and fame  was, he
 always boasted is he raped a 70 year old 
woman against a tree in a forest; and he always 
said this was his biggest accomplishment, is 

this what he did. And he was in love...uh, 
he loved...in love with a Gypsy girl who 
...who...who died before, but he slept with her 
dress. I mean, this man was completely 
deranged. So anyways, I am standing in this 
thing. And he walks over to me; and I speak 
German, so he says to me , "Bist du ein Jude? "  [
Ger:
 "Are you a Jew? "]  So I says, "Ja." 
And he says... Can I say it in German?  He says...I say, "Ja."  So he says, "Nein, du bist nicht 
kein Jude!" [
Ger:
 "No, you are no Jew!"]  I says, "Ja, Ich bin ein Jude." [
Ger:
 "Yes, I am a 
Jew."]  He took a fist and hit me  in the face.
 I spit out a tooth--I wish the dentist would do it 
as easily as he did it. Spit out a tooth; 
and I says, "Ja, bin nicht kein Jude." [
Ger:
 "Yes, I'm 
no Jew."]  So I admitted I'm not a Jew, and that
's all he wanted. Seems like I was, at that 
time, blonde; and I was only, I think, Arya
n looking fellow who he didn't want to 
become ...he [
NB: 
I] shouldn't be a Jew. So he gave me
 a job. And my job was to bring soup. 
And there where they fed us, we had to go down 
to the kitchen to bring those kettles of food-
-which was...uh, our daily insult. And I'm standing 
in line there; and one day he sent me the 
kettles on reveille. So when he sent us down to...to fetch the soup, seems like it was too late. 
Because when the fellow called off "27," in...ins
tead of saying, "Here," 
I didn't say, "Here." 
He said, "27!"  Nobody said, "Here.
"  He says, "28!"  Before he
 finished saying, "28," I said, 
"Here."  He didn't know whether it's means here 
for 28 or 27. So anyways, I was late. So he 
put me  over a bench. Some body held it...held 
me between his legs; and I got 15 on my 
behind. But he...he walked...he had a walking cane;
 and he had a tape--like a electric tape--
around it. And I got 15, which was a most excruciati
ng pain at that time. At the first few of 
them...after this, it...it didn't matter anymore.
 After this, I got up. I'm going to the soup, 
which--I'm bleeding rectally. He says, "You for
got some thing."  So what can you forget, if 
you're already getting 15 of it?  He says, "You 
forgot to say, 'Thank you.'"  So at this 
particular moment, I fainted. And when...in this
 place they had big squares which was full of 
water. In case of a air raid or 
fire, so the water was taken for the fireme n of the fire brigade to 
douche the...the... So he threw me .  So he kick
ed me  into this water. This was, oh...uh, he 

kicked me  in the thing. Only because I fo
rgot to say, "Thank you." Comi ng back to the 
barrack at that time, I don't know what, he made me his cook. I don't know anything about 
cooking at all. But he had provisions. He got potatoes. He got extra this--not what we used to 
get. Not the food we used to get. So I don'
t know anything about cooking. So only thing he

said, he likes sauerbraten or some kind of vi
negar. So whatever soup--I only ma de soup. So 
whatever soup, I finished the soup. Before I se
rved him, I took a tablespoon full of vinegar 
and put the vinegar into the soup. And he t
hought I was the most gourmet cook in the world, 
(laughing) because I made...I added vinegar to
 his...to his soup. And I always looked for 
details, details where I could get out of this 
particular camp...camp site to go to other camp; 
because I was looking for my parents. And specially, I'm looking for my brother. I thought 
he...if anybody gonna survive it, it's gonna be my 
brother gonna survive. So I got details...uh, 
cleaning toilets. I got a detail becomi ng--whateve
r gypsies were left, I became interpreter to 
the Gypsies. Only because I spoke Hungaria
n. I faked my Hungarian, they faked their 
Ruma nian; so we some how understood each other.
 And I always gave the answers--which I 
felt it was good--is what the German wanted to he
ar, instead of what the Gypsies said to me. 
But there were few of them left, already; because most of them perished. 
 
Q: Tell us about the Gypsies you me t. What were they like, and what were they doing?  
 
A: Now, I me t Gypsies in the...in the me n's cam
p. In the me n's camp, they were bewildered. 
They were bewildered. Not only...they felt themself a mi nority of a mi nority. So...so ...so 
they felt alienated, even among the camp survivor
s--uh, camp prisoners there, they felt alien. 
So they kept as a group. So they tried to shut 
their personality as much as they could. In the 
ladies camp--this was a phenomena which was very interesting. They became--some of them 

became--in charge of...of the block...charge of th
e...the barrack in itself. And it's amazing 
thing. They assume d a ma nly personality. They 
used to do like this (rubbing chin), which a 
woma n very seldom does. When they stood, 
they stood feet spread, you know. They...they 
became...they became a man. Maybe they...thr
ough being this manly personality, they 
became more assertive, or more... Became lead
ers of their particular group. So...so I think 
the men behaved more passively as...as the 
Gypsy ladies. The men became more passive 
than...than... than the wome n were. Anyway
s, I went and I never found anybody. Never 
found anybody in the camp. 
 
Q: Your family, you mean?  
 
A: No. I never found anybody. You know, it co
me s to a point, you know you don't expect. 
Well, first it's such a humanity. It's just 
a tremendous amount of humanity that you don't 
expect to. So the only thing I decided what I 
do in camp is, or since then I gonna do--since I 
don't think I have no answer to 
"left" or no answer to "right"--I don't gonna test fate. I don't 
gonna do anything against fate. If they tell me, 
"Stand there," I gonna stand here. If they tell 
me, "Stand here," I gonna stand here. If they 
say, "Go," I go. If they say, "Jump," I jump. 
Because since I don't know what to do, I didn't 
want to blame myself, you know. "I should...I 
went left, but they told me to go right. I s
hould have gone right, because ma ybe right would 
be better than going left."  This way, matte
r of fact, I dropped personal responsibility. I 
dropped my responsibility. I don't do anything. They
 tell me, I do. So one day, he comes in 
and the people come there with thing, and they
 stamp me. The stamp is right here on the 
chest; with a big black stamp. So it gives stamp;
 the stamp,   I don't know what it is. So he 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0093

says, "Anybody who's stamped has to go to Buna, to the coal mi ne."
5
  I said, "For coal 
mi ning, I don't...I gonna test fate. I'm not going wh
ere fate's going to send me ."  So I went 
and I tried to rub it off but I couldn't. The stamps seems like were very quite embedded, so I 
couldn't rub it off. So I went 
behind a  barrack and I got dirt. And I rubbed my chest with 
dirt. So problem was this:  my chest became, you know, raw. It's became here raw. So I was 
scared they should recognize that I...I have 
a raw spot, that I rubbed off the stamp. So I 
rubbed all over. Wherever I found a little spot, I rubbed this dirt into it, too; that I should 
have the same blotches which I had here, I should have it all over my body. And I met a 
friend. Not a friend. I met a man--by his name of Monyek Ravel, the same as the composer--
and we became friendly. And we decided whatever
 [we] do, we shall try to do it together. So 
whatever happen, let's...let's stick it togeth
er. At least I...I had somebody, I had a human 
being with me. It was the most bewildering 
thing. I was quite young at that time, you know. I 
was not the old...youngest one, but I 
was not one of the masses that were older than we were. 
And...and because it was getting very rough... Like in my barrack, there came  a man who 
was a Litzmannstadt, or in the ghetto--who was a
llegedly a big shot in the ghetto. He was not 
liked. So he comes to my barrack and he sa
ys, "I don't know why they don't like me ."  You 
know. Said it loud, you know. "I am...was only a 
barber. I was only a barber."  And the 
people says, "No. No. Your life is short-lived 
here."  Sure enough, by next morning he was 
floating in..in the cesspool. Seemed like they killed him, so... In the barrack. I mean, human 
life was not accountable. Huma n life was not 
important. Human life was the cheapest 
commodity, we always said. And we stayed in Auschwitz for some  time; and after this, we 

wind up...started to transport to camps. I reme mber which camp was we go. We went from 

there. We went to a camp, which I remember 
because it was a short while. After this we 
wind up in a camp which was Kruppwerke. Krupp 
has a factory. We  were working, Monyek 
and I. And we saw a lot of people were working in this camp. And one day, there is an air 

raid. And we see that it's a... 
I don't know whose plane it was--American, French or whatever 
it was. And it's most amazing. We  had nowhe
res to hide. We just stood there and...and 
looked in amazing. And we saw the bombs 
comi ng; and you felt...every bomb... Looking up, 
you felt every bomb is meant for you. Which...which they didn't hit...didn't hit us at all. They 
went quite out...out of...of the ra
nge of the Kruppwerke. But the panic in the Germans, I 
never experienced before. This is the first tim
e I saw human panic. Not in us, but in my 
enemy. And I realized this, they'r e as...as scared as I was. And everybody 

cherished...cherished his own life, in his ow
n fashion. And it...and Monyek and I, we says, 
"You know some thing?  It's amazing. Amazing!" 
 He says, "Without a gun, they would be 
the same as I."  Except the only difference was, 
they had a bullet. And from there, we went 
to... 
 
Q: Hold on. Excuse me . 
 
A: Yes.

Q: What was it like in the Kruppwerke?  
 
A: In the camp...in the factory?  In the factory, we were working with a...certain...we had certain 
jobs. I had a job ma king...making... I had a big 
thing making holes in...in certain...certain 
metals, I think. There was some supervisors, which were Germans themselves, which ran the 
factories. Elderly gentlemen, which were 
kind to us. I me an, they were...you know, they 
were there. They knew who we was. I don't know
 if they knew we were concentration. I'm 
sure they knew we were concentration inmates,
 but they were okay. I mean, they were a little 
bit if kindness. Let's put it. I mean, we enc
ountered the first time a little bit of kindness to 
humanity. The first time we encountered a little
 bit of humanity from them. But, you know, 
if...if a soldier--I don't know a soldier, a se
rgeant or somebody with...with a uniform--they 
saw a uniform, the attitude changed. Which was just
 natural, I could see it. They were scared 
themselves, you know. But they never would give anything personal. I mean, with me  they 
could converse, at least, speaking German; but 
there was never something personal. Give me 
a piece of bread, or give me ...which was a welc
ome thing from them, but they would never. 
Never. Never. Never gave us anything like that
. So we worked in the Kruppwerke. And from 
there, it seems like from there we went to 
Buchenwald. And Buchenwald was one of the 
nicer camps, I think. Buchenwald was one 
of the nicer... I mean, the other camps I 
experienced since...before or...or since. And one
 day, we had to have a...and by then I was 
started... My beard, I remembere over there the di
fficulty with growing; because they told 
me to I have to shave. I don't know how I shav
ed before, I don't remember. But over there, I 
remember. So they gave me a piece of glass to
 shave, because nobody wanted to give a razor 
or had a razor. So they gave me a piece of
 glass to shave. Which was unbelievable, too. 
But...so finally some body was nice to me . One of
 the inmates, also. And he gave me a 
straight razor. And so...so I finally I shaved ove
r there. It was the first time I shaved with 
straight razor over there, instead of the piece...pi
ece of glass. And told us to wash. So this 
Monyek and I, we washed in a drinking fount
ain. Just a little drinking fountain. And we took 
a bath; and it was quite a welcome relief to...to 
be allowed to be washed. Because in...in the 
Kruppwerke, before, we worked in this greasy 
water; and this was always running, always 
black. And we always smelled from oil. A
nd they didn't care about us at all. But 
Buchenwald, they...they allowed us to was
h. And... but hunger was always there. Hunger 
was always there. Death wasn't  any problem a
nymore, because we accepted it. It's eventually 
gonna happen, so we became less scared of...of 
dying. It became as a everyday occurrence; 
so it was not a big deal any more. From Bu
chenwald, we went to so ma ny camps I don't 
reme mber. Uh, Buchenwald... 
 
Q: How long were you in Buchenwald?  
 
A: Time  is not a factor with me . I have no...no conception of times anymore. 
 
Q: Can you...can you tell me  some  of the work that you did in Buchenwald. 
 
A: Buchenwald?  Nothing. Nothing. The only thi
ng, I set... met--somebody pointed out to me, I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0093

don't know whether it's were the truth or not--I met Schuschnigg, which was the Prime 
Minister of Austria.
6
 They said, "You see him?  This is 
Mr. Schuschnigg."  Plus, they showed 
me  a lady who was Mrs. Rothschild. She was a Rothschild, a Viennese Rothschild. I met 
her; and...and you know, you had Mrs. Rothschild. But that's all that I remember about 
meeting Mrs. Rothschild and Mr. Schuschni
gg in...in Buchenwald. I don't know if it's the 
truth that he was Schuschnigg a
nd she was Mrs. Rothschild, but this what is pointed out to 
me , was they were there. After this, it became...and we went to a camp by name  of 

Ludwigslust.
7
 In Ludwigslust, we were working in
 a spring factory. Always with Monyek. 
Monyek...wherever I went, Monyek went with me . My friend, Monyek. Uh, I worked in the 
factory in...in ma king springs; and what's good about
 this is is our camp in...in the factory 
was almost a unit. So we didn't have to marc
h too far from work to the thing. And... and...and 
the camp commander was uh quite a human being, at that time. I mean, he was...I mean, he 

could he could...always fed us... I mean, I don't tr
y to ma ke excuses for him;  but...but he fed 
us. He fed us, or whatever it was there. 
I was making springs there for car door springs
; 
except my job was I was on the night shift. Ni
ght shift consists of 12 o'clock 'til who knows 

when the hours in the morning. Except I was ma
king--instead of springs, Monyek and I were 
ma king knives for the Germans for their own us
e. So we ma de this...we was...out of those 
big wheels we was polishing and polishing thos
e knives to make the knives; and somebody 
else ma de those wooden handles. So for each 
knife, we got...he gave us half a slice of 
bread...as half a sandwich. Monyek got one half
 a sandwich, and I got 
half a sandwich. For 
making the whole night long work to make th
e bread. And the circumstances were not not 
good, but wasn't  bad.  Uh, the prisoners that...t
he...we already got bunks. We  were allowed to 
sleep two...two to a bunk. Which was much better 
than we had in Auschwitz, or any other 
camp. They were almost like cots in...in big ba
rracks. And the SS, or whoever watched over 

us, were elderly gentlemen. The...instead 
of those young punks, we had elderly gentleme n 
watching us. So it wasn't ... uh, wasn't ...wasn'
t extremely bad. It wasn't  the worst 
circumstances I ever lived through was already th
ere. And from there, we found out that we 
are...we had...we had a transport to go to Swed
en. Yes, we had...seems like Hitler tried to 
make a pact with the Austrian
--with the Swiss, that he should get Swiss citizenship. And to 
show good faith, he allowed a transport of Jews--concentration camp Jews--to go to Sweden. 
So we bec... Was it that time?  Yes. We became a transport to go to Sweden. I think it was 
that time, or before. And they gave us.... No, 
it wasn't  near Litzmann. It wasn't  this camp. 
One camp afterwards. From there we went to
 another camp. This camp where we were, 
we...they gave us...we stayed in the camp for a short time, and that time we had... They 

created a transport to go to Sweden. They gave
 us Red Cross packages. And they gave us 
each of us Red Cross packages. I had a job to
 open every Red Cross package, and take out 
the chocolate and give it to the Germans. So
 all...every Red Cross package, whoever got, 
was mi nus chocolate. And everything else cam
e to us. And it was actually a bowl. And the 
bowl was fabulous, because we had food. Except we
 didn't know when to stop. So we almost

finished everything what they gave us at
 that time. The whole thing fell through. The 
transport fell through. Seems like that the Sw
edish government or the Swiss government 
didn't do it for Himml er. So the first thing what 
they did to us, they took the packages away. 
Whatever was left they...they took those p
ackages. When humanity stopped, the bestiality 
started all over again; and they took another tr
ansport. And they took us on a transport in 
open cattle cars. But that time, was open with
 no roof. We  were sitting, and completely 
exposed to the element. And we traveled; s
eemed like nobody wanted to take us because we 
were this...the privileged characters, we suppos
ed to go to...to Sweden. Seems like at that 
time, whatever, the hierarchy didn't want...nobody wa
nted to take us. We traveled for three 
days in those open cars. No water, no food. F
ood wasn't  a tremendous factor--at least for me. 
Thirst was. It came to a point that I...my t
ongue swelling in my mouth. This I couldn't close 
my mouth. I was...thirst was unbearable. Unbearable! And my things...my lips swelled. My 
tongue swelled. And it was unbearable. And after three or four days, it seems like an eternity, 

they sent us to a camp which was being built by Russian soldiers--by Russian prisoners of 
war camp. Which was a brick camp for American 
flyers, which supposed to be a show camp. 
When it was finished, it was supposed to
 be a show camp--how...how humanely the 
American prisoners of war are being treate
d. This camp was doing construction. Seems like 

it was terrible there, because the Russian sold
iers...uh soldiers practiced cannibalism. Uh, not 
on a live one; but cannibalism on whoever died. It 
seems like this...this part of the thumb was 
the biggest morsel they could eat. No water. There was one surface pump, which was for 

mak...mixing cement or something like this. And there were soldiers staying watching this 
pump; because this was surface water, which they were scared of typhus. So anybody who 

was drinking, want to drink, wa
s shot immediately. It was not for the preservation of the 
prisoners, but it's for their own preservation of the German soldiers. So over there was...was 

very bad. And finally we came to this camp, t
oo; not having water, not allowed... That's the 
first thing they told us, not allowed to drink th
is water. So a soldier, just to prove...just to 
prove he did... he meant this thing, he took a gun and he said, "Boom!"  And he shot 

some body. So he proved his point to me . So he 
took one life...or not to me , personally. So he 
proved...he took some body's life to prove a point
. So it was like saying, "Good morning," or, 
"Good evening," he shot this ma n. A Russian 
thing--I shall never forget--it was long...he had 
a hat with long ear muffs. And this ma n was wast
ed, just to prove I shouldn't drink his water. 
We  stayed in this camp; and we was...we 
were working in this camp. We  did not...no 
barracks at that time. We slept on sand...sand, which was mi xing the cement. Rooves wasn't  
there. Under the elements, we only slept to 
them. Whatever...we was scared most of the 
Russian soldiers; more than of the Germans, 
because they were more with us. The Germans 
were outside. The Russians... because what they 
did during the night, they used to kill us and 
take the shoes away. 
 
Q: Who used to take the shoes?  
 
A: The Russian soldiers. The Russian prisoners. Choke us to death or stab us to death. You 
know, the prisoners; so they could take the shoe
s away, or whatever. This flimsy piece, this 
one piece of...this pants and shirt, we had. No
 underwear. They took it away, because they 
didn't have anything. So Monyek and I, we alwa
ys ma de sure we slept not laying down. We 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0093

was sitting back to back so one could look fo
rward and one could look backwards. And this 
way we always had a common protection. 
But hunger over there was unbearable. Hunger 
there was unbearable. So not far down the road 
was a sugar beet factory. In Europe, they'r e 
ma king sugar--not out of cane. They'r e ma king s
ugar out of beets. So...and one night I said, 
"Monyek, I'm going over and I'm going to eat as much as I want."  He didn't want to do it. I 
said, "You stay here. I come  back."  So I got
 out and I...I put my pants. I tied...whatever 
pants I had, I tied on my... my leggings together
. And I went in to...to the beets. But I 
couldn't carry the beets, because they were very
 heavy and I couldn't carry it. I was too weak. 
But seems like there's another pile which there'
s the shavings. Seems like before the beet is 
going to sugar--a mill or something--they do 
like rough shaving. Like pieces of wood, like 
wood shavings. So I filled myself up with thes
e sugar beets and where I could; and I went 
through and I...the sugar beets. Which I did a 
disservice. Not realizing you eat the sugars 
beets, this shaving of the sugar beets, 
you extend your stomach. So anybody who ate it, who 
ate a lot of it, they...they couldn't make it. Th
ey died because of the sugar beets itself; 
because the stomach just...just busted. Just bus
ted. Seems like Monyek and I and quite a lot 
of other [of] us survived it. Bu
t a lot of them just...just couldn't make it. And...and we stayed 
there; and it was getting worse and worse 
and worse. And all of sudden, the camp 
commander comes to us and he says, "The 
Russians are comi ng, and...uh they'r e going to kill 
us."  All the prisoners of war are going to
 kill us, because the Russians know we were 
helping the German economy. So he says to
 us, "All people who wants to ma rch gonna 
ma rch with us."  And he points to me  and sa
ys, "He's the first one who goes."  And I says, 
"No."  He says, "You will!"  I said, "No."  A
nd this was the biggest beating I got in my 
lifetime. I got from this man, with a--he didn'
t have a walking [stick], he had a long like a 
hiking stick. A long...a long... Like a five-foot l
ong stick. And he ma de me  as an example. 
And he didn't stop beating me. That...beat me in
 front. It was unbelievable. And I...it doesn't  
matter anymore. By that time, didn't matter; 
because I couldn't walk anyways because the 
beating was so hard. And he disappeared. And no...no soldiers. And we were free. Except, 

there was no food. In our adulation, in our happi
ness, there was nothing we could do about it. 
We  couldn't eat enough. We  only had those suga
r beets, and we wouldn't eat those sugar 
beets. Only thing we had a bowl was to dri
nking water. We  finally...not from this...not from 
the pump; but we found where they kept the dri
nking water. And plus we were scared of the 
Russians. The Russian--not the Russian sold
iers which gonna come in, but the Russian 
prisoners of war because uh they were a rough 
bunch of guys. Anyways, finally at two days 
later from the road, we see tanks comi ng. And we
 see tanks with a five pointed star. I didn't 
know how American tanks look, and I didn't know
 the emblem of an American tank. So 
five-pointed stars looks like the Russian star
. Except they were American tanks. So the 
American tanks passes by. And finally, a few hour
s later, a little Russia--not Russian. A little 
American solider comes in. Very short, with 
the rucksack, with the pack, with everything 

else. And a mi racle, finally. But this wasn't  th
e biggest mi racle I saw that day. He says he's 
thirsty. And I says, "There's no water here."  
He says, "What about the pump there? "  I says, 
"You're not allowed to drink, because you're gonna
 die."  He went to the pump, put water in 
the canteen, put a pill into it, shook it and dra
nk it. This...and this was the biggest mi racle I 
ever saw. And I...finally, I became a free ma n at 
that time. So he said they... (Deep sigh)  I'm 
a...fine.

TECHNICAL CONVERSATION 
 
A: So. 
 
Q: The day of liberation. 
 
A: The day of liberation. So the American soldiers dranking the water. And he put this little pill 
in. And I found it was the greatest 
mi racle I ever saw in my lifetime, that he was allowed to 
drink things that we were killed for it. We died
 for it. And he drank it. So he said that we 
should stay. And I was in no ci
rcumstance. I was sick and beaten up and bleeding. I have a 
scar. I still have a scar somewheres here. (Pointi
ng at his head)  I have a scar fr om my back. 
Uh, he says wait, they gonna send food for us. 
Sure enough, a half a day later, they sending... 
There's a kitchen comes, uh a truck with a soup kitchen; and it was supplied by the French 
army. And the French army says that before 
they'r e gonna give us soup we have to sing the 
"Marseillaise."  And I said, "Shove it."  And I didn't sing the "Marseillaise;"  I didn't drink 

their food, and I walked out of camp a free ma n, 
without being subservient to the French for 
singing the "Marseillaise."  Monyek said, "Let's sing it."  I said, "Monyek, Goodbye. I'm 
leaving."  My friend Monyek changed his mi nd 
and followed me . And we didn't sing it. We  
walked out. So the fi rst act of defi ance, after not singing the "Marseillaise," I saw a German 
soldier and I...I took his jacket away. And I 
wore his jacket; because I was...I had nothing 
and I was bleeding. So my jacket was ripped a
nd I had no jacket. So we were ma rching, and 
next day... We slept in the fields somewheres
. Next day, we saw American soldiers. And 
they were throwing balls...a ball to each other 
with tremendous big gloves. And I said, "Look 
at this foolish thing that they doing! Why th
ey don't catch them by hand? "  And this is the 
first time I was faced with baseball. I never saw it before. And it was unbelievable. I found it 

extremely childish. This look...big grown men throwing ball and catching it with a glove 
instead of catching it by hand. And later, one fellow used a stick! So it...it was quite amusing. 
So we'r e ma rching; and we passing a fi
eld kitchen where the...uh...uh...a fellow, an 
American, cook. And we saw there is a little fen
ce; and there's a space and there was a table 
there, and there's...they were cooking some meat. And he was cutting meat. You know, meat. 

And...and I was hungry.  And I said, "Food. Food."  So every time he cut a piece of meat-- 

and I had a German...I want to emphasize, 
I had a German uniform on. I had a German 
jacket on. Every time he threw the meat, he 
threw it short enough I should never catch it. 
Except he...there was a dog in front of me , on the ot
her side of the fence. So all the meat he 
threw towards me  went to the dog. And I never got the meat. And I was extremely 
disappointed and extremely hungry. So this was it. But we...but that time we already had 
some thing to eat, you know. A piece of bread he
re. We got a little piece of bread here; 
whatever we could scrounge it. But I never got
 this piece of meat from this cook, this 
American soldier. And we decided we gonna
 ma rch. We  gonna go to France. We  gonna go 
to France. Why?  Because Monyek had a sister ther
e before the war, and she always said it's a 
lovely life in...in France. So we says, "Why 
not? "   "We go this way, or go this way? " 
Finally, I said, "Which way you think is France? "  
 So he said, "This way."  "Okay. Let's walk 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0093

this way."  Didn't (laughing) matter to us. So
 we ma rching to France. A American soldier 
gets hold of us. He says, "Where are you goi
ng? "  So...I don't know how they understood it. 
We  said we go to France. He says, "That's fi
ne. Come  on. Go in the Jeep. We  take you to 
Paris."  I said, "How good can it be? "  We go 
to Paris; except he--I don't know where he took 
us--he took us to the detention camp. So we 
stayed in the detention camp. And uh...I says, 
"Monyek, I don't want to stay here. I have e
nough detention camp."  He say he gonna stay, 
because he wants to go to Paris. And we 
said goodbye to each other; and I never saw 
Monyek again. We  never saw him. And I went
...there was a group in this detention camp. 
Wa s a group of Polish forced laborers. Peopl
e who were taken out of Poland--not in 
concentration camp, but were taken out as a fam
ily to work on fields in Germany. And they 
were the forced...Polish forced labor. Not Jews
. Forced labor. So I decided I gonna go with 
them. May as well go back to Poland, which is 
closer to Czechoslovakia than wherever I 
was. 
 
Q: Did you... Excuse me . Did you explain to the 
Americans that you were Jewish?  You were 
still in this German uniform. 
 
A: I had...I had nothing to explain. 
I couldn't speak it. I couldn't speak at all. I couldn't speak at 
all that. Couldn't even say that. And with the 
Polish, I definitely would not say I was Jewish. 
The Polish are defi nitely against Jews. So they
 put us to a camp; and we were in a camp 
which seemed like it was a big school or someth
ing. Because they gave me a room to sleep, 
because next day they'r e gonna take me t
o...to Poland. I speak Polish also, among other 
languages. I speak, I think, seven of them. So I
...except I speak Slavic languages, instead of 
speaking English. And I slept on th
e floor that time. And at least I slept in a room. I mean, it 
was the first time I really slept in a room. A
nd they'r e taking us to...separate next morning, 
the families and everything else. They take us 
on trucks. And they take us over... Seems like 
between the Russian Army and the American Army, there was a no ma n's land. They kept a 
separation--I think it was about a few miles. It
 comes about evening...late in the evening and 
we go to the Polish...uh, go to the Russian side
. And now, of all th
ings, I became Polish. 
And... (laughing) and...and we get off...we going on th
e other side. And it's quite late at night 
and we always get off the truck; and th
e Polish laborers they had...bundles, you know, and 
blankets, whatever. And whatever they loote
d, whatever they robbed, and everything else. 
They take the men, separate the men; and 
they separate the women and children. And I 
became part of the men. I walked in with the men; and even having a German jacket, I spoke 
Polish. So...so that there was no uh ...uh, it didn't m
ean any difference. They didn't expect me 
not to be Polish. You marched to a field. And 
a little fellow came up. I mean, ma ybe five feet 
tall. A Russian Colonel or a Russian General, wh
atever he was. And he gives us a...a speech. 
He says that we have collaborated. Doesn't mean
 me as a Jew, but me 
as Polak. All of us...all 
of the Polish men. We collaborated to the German
s, to the war machines of Germany, for the 
destruction of Russia. And now we are his en
emies, and we gonna be all shot. For this, I 
went through a concentration camp--to be shot 
by the Russians. So he said: but since the 
Russian government is..is a good-hearted govern
me nt, he exonerates us for only [one] 
reason--because we volunteer into the Russian
 Army. And by stroke of this word, we 
became Russian soldiers. But by that time, Germany and Russia was already in chaos. The 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0093

whole thing was in chaos. So th
ey didn't have any pants to give us; so I had only pair...pair of 
German boots, and I didn't have no socks. I ha
d my striped...still had my striped pants on. He 
took this thing away...this German thing awa
y, gave me  a Russian jacket. And we were 
marching with the Russians. Marched all 
night long, and uh...no food. Absolutely no food! 
So we come to a little village. And there is 
a Russian--is a high echelon soldier. I don't know 
what he was. Colonel, or whatever he was. 
And he looked Jewish. I don't know. I just felt he 
looked Jewish. So I went to him, and I says
, "You know, I am Jewish. You have anything to 
eat? "   But he said, "In Russia, everybody's th
e same . We  don't care if you're Jew or not. 
Everybody's the same ."  So I said, "Okay."  A
nd we kept on ma rching in, with our job was 
looting. We  were looting. They were looting...whatever they could get ahold of, they were 

looting. I didn't need anything. I didn't want a
nything. So the only thing I found was sugar. I 
found two bags. I went to some body's German 
home; and two bags of sugar. Like...only 
thing, I don't know why it possessed me . That's a
ll what I was...from all the looting what 
possessed me , just to have the two pieces of sugar. And that was....they fed us, you know, 
this pork stuff and everything else. And I was
...I was sick, and I was tired and I was filthy, 
and everything else. Eventually getting to a 
German...big German farm. Big German farm. 
And it's dust around it. So everybody drink. There's a tremendous amount of vodka they'r e 

drinking. Tremendous amount of alcohol they
 were consuming. And more...more what 
they'r e drinking, the more boisterous they'r e becomi ng, and the more dangerous I felt 
my...myself there. First thing, not being Ru
ssian; and not being Polish, and not being 
Christian. So...so the whole thing was awful frus
trating. Anyways, I go to the farmer. And I 
speak to the farmer in German. I said to him,
 "I'm Russian..."  So I 
never thought about that. 
I said, "I'm a Russian soldier, and I never slept 
in a bed for weeks."  I says, "I would love to 
sleep in a bed," I said to him. But he 
said, "You know there is no bed. You people took 
everything out. You took everything over. We  
are ourselves sleeping in a barn. There's 
nothing there."  I said, "You know, I have two bags 
of sugar."  So I gave
 him the two bags of 
sugar. So he wants to...he said to me, "Y
ou know, it's very amazing. You being Russian, how 
come you speak such a good German? "   I said, "I went to the language school in Kiev."  I 

mean, I just made up. I didn't trust him. He doesn
't  trust me. So I said I went to the language 
school in Kiev. So he gave me  
a bed. It seems like in a barn where the cow...where the cows 
are standing, where they'r e eating, seems like for the help or something there was a room 

beyond... beyond those where the cows were standi
ng and eating. So he gave me this room; 
and I slept overnight for these two bags of 
sugar. Reveille in the morning. I sleep. I don't 
want to get up. And they holler and they holler.
 And I am scared. I said, "The only thing is 
happen if they catch me, they'll think I overslept
."  With all this noise. If they believe me, 
they believe me. If they don't believe me, they don't believe me. And I stayed there. And I 

stayed there 'til maybe afternoon. Scared. Scare
d. Scared. Scared. I mean, I didn't want to 
die. This time now, I didn't want to die anymore. I mean, finished. The dying part...part is 

over. And I was lucky enough...they weren't there.
 They left me behind. I go out. It seems 
like somebody, another man, had the same idea what I had. He had the same idea. So him 

and I, we decided we'r e gonna go back to Poland. 
So this...this... They left the farmer with a 
horse and a...and a...like a carriage. So he said, "Let's take the farmer's carriage, and let's go 
at night."  And I couldn't do it. I mean, he's
 the fellow who saved me . He's  the fellow who 
gave me  a room to sleep. So I says, "No, we
'r e not going to take it. Let's walk and find 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0093 
2

some wheres else."  So sure enough, we ke
pt on ma rching and we saw a German with 
a...with a same thing--with the horse and th
ing. We  took his, and we...we kept on going. We  
didn't go too far. They took us...the Russian...s
omebody, not Russian soldiers. They caught a 
transport of forced laborers, which same  [as]
 with we went they took the me n away. This 
was a transport where the families was still t
ogether. So they ma de...this ma n and I, we 
joined them in the event that we going on the 
way to Poland. So we stop at night time. We 
stop, and they separated the me n and the wome n. And it was like a...a garage, in a big 
garage. A car garage. So the me n slept in one ga
rage, and the wives slept in the other garage. 
The soldiers got themselves drunk, and they 
raped all the women. The noise was unbearable. 
And it was the worst thing was...was the husband or
 lovers or brothers had to listen to the 
yelling of the...the wome n. Next morning, 
nobody looked at each other. The wome n didn't 
look at the men. The men didn't look at th
e woman. It was tremendous embarrassment. 
Tremendous embarrassment. But anyways, we
 getting into Poland. Poland...we came into 
Poland. I escaped, and I decided... No. No. Not 
true. We came into Czechoslovakia. We 
came into Czechoslovakia. The transports was 
going to continue into Poland. I escaped from 
Poland. It was in...in the city of 
Plze_. I went back to Teplice...to Prague. I went to Prague, I 
got sick. I eventually wound up--with all the 
beating what I had, I wound up in a hospital. 
And I stayed in the hospital for almost three 
weeks. And I was quite sick; and I was staying 
by myself. They thought they'r e going to cheer me  up. So they put me  in a room with 
Russian Colonels or ranking offi
cers, also which was sick. One fellow was sick because he 
was shooting at some  uh...nest with soldiers, so
 they gave him a me dal. And he was sick. 
And I was in this room with the soldier; whic
h was like a ball to me, because every time they 
brought in food for the Russians, I got extra 
above and beyond. And in Czechoslovakia, at 
that time wasn't  so good. Except that one bad 
thing--that every time they were drinking 
vodka, they were ma king me  drink the vodka. So 
with all the medication I got, I never got 
better. And they couldn't understand how come
 I... There was no reason I wasn't  getting 
better; because not realizing I was drinking alcohol constantly with those Russian soldier. 

'Til some body found the reason, took me  out and I got 
better. And I went back to Teplice, to 
the city where I was born. And uh ...I was 
the only Jew who came  back. There was nobody 
left in the whole city. (Deep sigh - choking 
up)  And we had a big house. And the house 
belonged to us, you know, when we left. But th
ey couldn't give me the house back; because 
Teplice, where I'm...where I am from, is know
n for three things. It's known for coal mi ning. 
Known as a spa. By the way, my mother was pres
ident of the culture of the city of Teplice. 
And they ma ke crystals. So the German who 
was using my house was the engineer from the 
coal mi ne. They didn't want to antagonize him, 
because in case he should do sabotage in the 
coal mi ne. This was after the war. So they...after the war. This was in 19...end of l945. The 

war ends in May. And so not to antagonize him,
 so he shouldn't do any damage to the coal 
mi ne. So they gave me a lovely apartment. 
They gave me a complete furnished apartment; 
uh, and they gave me  a business. They gave me  a business. The Czech governme nt gave me 
a business. I don't know, because I was a 
unique. You know, the unique person. Finally, 
somebody came back. They gave me an electrical
 store with the repair. You know, doing the 
repair shops, everything else; which was quite
 good. And I'll tell you a little small incidence. 
And they gave me  food stamps. Above and be
yond. They gave me  like privileged class food 
stamps. So I had quite a lot of food. So...so 
life was comi ng to that. But I had no family. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0093

Absolutely nobody. But...but life as...as for physical need was quite good. And I am staying 
once in a butcher shop, and a woma n come s over to me . And she says to me  in German--and 
at that time all of a sudden nobody spoke German. Because all of a sudden, you became a 
Czech patriot. Matter of fact, when I wa
s born, my...even my birth certificate was still 
written in German. But all of a sudden nobody 
spoke German. So immediately it became 
Czechoslovakia, nobody speaks German. Anyways,
 she comes over to me and speaks in 
German to me . She said, uh, "Excuse me , can
 I ask you some thing? "  Here I don't know, 
should I say I speak German or shouldn't I?  
So I didn't mi nd. So she says, "Are you Mr. 
Helmer? "   Which was the most amazing thing. So 
I says, "Yes."  She says, "I was a maid for 
your parents. And you look the same  as your fath
er."  And she became a maid of mi ne. Not 
only her, her daughter. And she...she didn't beco
me  a ma id for...for wages, but there came 
another maid. She came to cook for me, to clean
 for me . She didn't stay with me . For food; 
because I had enough food. So they didn't ha
ve enough food. So...so I stayed there. And... 

and I travelled...I travelled to Prague a lot of 
time. I had a room there, and everything else. 
And life was quite good 'til one day they come , a y
ear later; and they decided they want to 
draft me in the Russian Army. I mean, the 
Party was creating a Czech Army, and they 
wanted to create I should be go to Russia. I sa
id, "Listen, I just came through all this mess, 
all this thing I went through all my life. I mea
n, I don't have to tell you."   He said, the man 
says to me at the interview...he says, "Let's
 face it. Who going to mi ss you? "  So it was very 

bad. And I refused to do so; and instead they ga
ve me time to think about it. I said, "Okay, 
give me time to think about it."  But at the 
same  token, they started taking my food away. 
They start taking the...uh, the food stamps away
--the better food stamps away. And not only 
this; they took my store away. And I became a he
lper to an electrician in my own store. I 
mean, the store wasn't  mi ne anymore. They gave
 it to a...to a comr ade who was better than I. 
At least I had a job to go. And life became qu
ite unbearable. Life became quite unbearable. I 
went to Prague, and I me t some body who said
 he's going to go...smuggle himself out. He's 
going to Israel. I says, "You know something?  Israel is better than...than here. How do I get 

out? "   What I wanted, at that time, I thought 
ma ybe I go to America. I had...my mother had a 
sister, an older sister here. "I 
go to America."  I said, "If not Israel, I want to go to America." 
So I got in touch in....with the Haganah. A
nd the Haganah said, "You come  to Marienbad 
[
NB:
 Mariánské Lázn_], and we gonna smuggle you 
through back to Germany."  So I said, 
"What is..."  They said,  "No packages, no cl
othing. You walk out of your apartment. Make 
sure you keep the stove running, like you walk
ed down to the grocery for a paper or 
something. Leave the lights on. Walk out, and not come back."  And exactly what I did. I 

don't know what happened to the apartment, whatever was boiling there. I went to Karlsbad 
[
NB:
 Karlovy Vary]. I stayed in Karlsbad for 
a day, and to Marienbad. The only thing which 
I didn't do, which they asked me to do, is they said they wanted to give all my papers up. 
Which I did...wasn't ready to do so. So I didn't 
give my papers. I was smuggled...there was a 
group ma ybe of four. There was a little...young girl, 
and there were two ladies and two men. 
There must have been five of us. And there wa
s shooting with the thing; and finally we got 
to Germany. I don't know if the Russians...I don'
t know if the Russians were shooting at us, 
or the Germans or the Polish--or the Czech were shooting us, or the Germans were shooting 
us. There was shooting going on. And I reme mber we came  down a...a like a ravine or 
some thing, on our behinds, you know. But he sa
ys nothing. And finally I wound up in the

country of my enemy. And I wind up in Germ
any again. And I wound up in Munich. And I 
had to... And at that time, a lot of Jews
 had...did a lot of black marketeering. Black 
marketeering became...became a way of supporting se
lf. I just couldn't do it; so I got myself 
a little bit of a job with--not 
with HIAS--with the Jewish Restitution Committee, something.

And I...I ma de not...didn't ma ke enough, but I 
had enough. And I stayed in the city in 
Munich, and bought a stye
. Which... I stayed with a lady 
whose son--she was German--
whose son was executed two days before th
e war ended. Maybe you heard about it. He 
was...he did the rebellion, the high school rebellion 
in the school. He was one of her son. So I 
stayed with this lady. Then, from nowhere
s, Renya--the girl which I knew from the 
underground--pops up in Munich. I don't know how she found me . What happen is, she 
found me  in Munich. And she says, "You cannot 
give up responsibility."  And I joined the 
CIC, which is the counterintelligence; and I 
became an agent of the counterintelligence, 
looking for Nazis. So...which was in itself not
 a bad thing, because this gave me an 
opportunity to travel and looking for my fa
mily. So I wound up in Poland again. And I 
wound up in the city of _ód_, in the city where 
I lived. (Sigh)  And I...I went up to the 
apartment, and found food stamps. The old f
ood stamps, and some other papers which I 
donated to the Museum. But I never found anybody 
else. By the way, when I went back...the 
reason I went back to Poland is that the Colone
l was in charge of me says, "I hear rumors 
that the Jews which go back to Poland are being killed."  So he said he wants to fi nd out. So I 
went back as a Polak. And sure enough, ther
e...they formed an organization which was 
called Armi a Krajowa, "the Army of the Land."  So when a Jew came back to a small town 
and he wanted his home, his business, whatever
 this else, the fellow [who] was taking care of 
it found it legally became his all of 
a sudden after a year and a half. So they used to kill them. 
Matter of fact, I've pictures...report of those pi
ctures also donated to the Museum with names 

me ntioned and towns where those Jews were k
illed. After comi ng back fr om all those years 
in the concentration camp, they were kille
d by the Armi a Krajowa. And I didn't fi nd 
anybody else, and I couldn't wait to leave Poland. 
Never went back to Hungary. We nt back 
to Germany and looking for Nazis. I looked a lo
t. I was looking for a particular Nazi. I was 
looking for who they said worked for UFA. 
UFA is like a Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer--a film 
company. And I was...as a German, we says we want
 to see how he is. We
 tried to get him as 
[if] we wanted him to form a former German 
organization. We tried to get ahold of him. 
 
Q: I'm sorry. I don't understand. 
 
A: We tried to...we didn't go to question the Germans as a Germans. I questioned them as a ex-
Nazi. I didn't want to... you know, all of a sudde
n, "Here I am. Good morning."  I mean, what 
you're looking for him as...as we want to get in 
touch with him where they are... Just to find 
out where they are. Because after I knew where 
they were, it wasn't  my job to get ahold of 
them, to catch them. So long as we find where he was. As a ma tter of fact, they sent me  to 
this UFA--which,  as I just said, was a film 
thing--I met a lady. Who we were looking for this 
particular big shot from the city of Beckum
, in Germany. The reason we were looking...it's a 
very interesting thing is, I was looking for this 
particular Nazi all over. The Colonel who was

my colonel of CIC, he came fr om Beckum. He
 was Jewish. When Hitler came to power, he 
went to England to school. He stays in Engl
and. And his parents lived in Beckum, a small 
town, as a Jewish family. His mother passed 
away. His father was ge
tting old. He was...had a 
ma id--a woma n who was taking care of the father, you know-- before the Nazis...the Nazis 
took over. So she stayed in the same house, taki
ng care of this old man. This particular Nazi 
I was looking for got ahold of this lady; and he
 said, "You slept with a Jew."  Took this man 
and threw him down a flight of 
steps. Took this lady, and put her in a garbage--at that time, 
you know, horse...horses were carrying...taking ga
rbage out, you know, for garbage...to take 
to garbage dump. So she was in this--remi nds me of Robespierre, of the French Revolution. 
They took them...they took this woma n through th
e city on this garbage heap,  with a big 
sign: "I'm a Jew lover. I sleep with Jews."  So
 this was his vengeance. He wanted to find this 
Nazi, just to revenge himself against...because 
...against his father and this lady. So this 

eventually wind up in UFA; and I met this lady which wanted a lot of money to tell me 

where he is. So I went back to the Colonel; and he says, "Give it to her."  Money with him 
didn't matter or anything. So I finally went w
ith money; and she's changed her mi nd. Says 
she will not do it. So I never found him. Actua
lly, I never found him. I found out years later. 
I met a sergeant who was sergeant in this...this headquarters there. He was...this same 

German we were looking for...was a cook in he
adquarters. He never left the town. He was 
always there. And I was looking all over for him. He was there as 
a cook. And we found out 
because he had a girlfriend who finally...uh, repor
ted him. It was years after I already came 
to America. 
 
Q: What was the Nazi's name? 
 
A: I have no idea. I don't remember his name
. I don't reme mber. K...K...K... Some thing with a 
K. So...so...so I was looking. So I never found. 
And I never found anybody else. So one day I 
go also looking, and going to Landsberg--whi
ch is outside of Munich. And I'm 
looking...looking for...for...for Nazis. I'm l
ooking for my...anybody family. Can't find it. 
Landsberg was a prison camp, what Hitler wrote Mein Kampf
. Outside of Munich. He was 
in jail, and he wrote Mein Kampf
. And they ma de a DP camp
 out it. Looking now. "Does 
anybody know Sonia? "  "You have a picture? "  I 
have no picture. I don't have no picture. 
Actually, I was not looking for Sonia. I was l
ooking for Helmers. Any Helmer. And actually, 
I was looking for Irving--my brother's name. And Irving Helmer, I thought, "He's a man. 

He's gonna..."  He was young enough to survive. He was around six years younger than I 
was. If anybody survived it, he's the one surv
ived. Leaving Landsberg, as disappointed as I 
was always disappointed, you know. And it's... And 
I'm... We getting to a traffic light. And I 
hitched a ride. I hitched a ride, and we'r e comi ng to a traffic light. I'
m going one direction; 
and there's a traffic light, and 
letting the traffic go. And there's...and naturally, the other side, 
the same thing--staying for the traffic light. 
You pass each other. And 
I hear a voice. I don't 
know if it's directed to me or 
not. He says, "How is Sonia? "  My sister's name  is Sonia. 
(Crying)  And I said, "She's dead."  And 
this voice... I don't know. Sonia is a popular name, 
so it doesn't  have to be addressed toward me
. He said, "I just sa
w her."  I don't know... I 
mean, since then, you know, my life completely cha
nged at that time. I had one aim in life: 
to look for my sister. I'm still in Munich. A
nd once in a while I go to the British ...British

headquarters; because I was working for the 
British CIC. Because Renya, this woma n, was 
involved with them. So I don't know how she got 
ahold of me. And I can't  find her. And I am 
once...I'm still involved officially with this UJA--with this...this Jewish Distribution 
Committee

 just to have a legality, you know. I meet
 a girl. She knows me, allegedly. I don't 
remember. She said, "I saw Sonia."  I says
... So this was really good hope. "She lives 
some wheres in Hannover."  So I go to Hannove
r. There is no camps. There is no camps 

where I can find Sonia. And this woma n's girlfr
iend lived in Hannover. So I finally meet this 
woma n; and she says, "Yes, I know Sonia Helm
er. She doesn't  live far from me . Matter of 
fact, we invited for a New Year's Day party ther
e."  She says, "You want to come  with me?  I 
go with you."  I said, "By all means."  I go w
ith her. So we go from Hannover to the city 
where Sonia lives. Except at that time the trains
 weren't running at night time. So we stayed 
in the station overnight. And next morning--6
 in the morning--we mi ssed the New Year's 

Day party, but the train didn't run because it 
was New Year's. Next morning, she finally 
walked. She knows where she is. She walks to 
Sonia['s place]; and she knocks on the door. 
It's about 6 or 5:30 in the morning. And Sonia 
lived with a girlfriend by the name of Hannah, 
who she went through the camp. And Hannah ope
ns the door and says, "Oh, my God, how 
come you came late?  You mi ssed the party and ev
erything else."  And I'm staying outside. 
And uh...she said, "The train wa
sn't  running. But I brought a friend of mi ne."  So Sonia, 
meanwhile, come s out...comes out from the r
oom. I just hear it. I didn't see it. "Oh, 
some body's here. Oh, good! Let me  go in and put
 some thing on."  So she walks out, come s 
back and come s to me  and says... Kisses this 
girl; and come s to me  and says, "Hello. How 
are you? "  Not realizing who I am. And she fa
inted. And this how I me t my sister. And by 
then, I already had my papers to come to America. Because I had an uncle who lived in 
Israel got ahold of me . And he said, "Don't come
 to Israel. Circumstances are very, very bad. 
Come  to America...if you have a chance, go to America."  So I had a chance to go to 

America as--not as a displaced person, as...as a 
political refugee. So I came as...as a political 
refugee. 
 
Q: What about Sonia?  
 
A: Sonia stayed there. And she stayed here. Sh
e had papers to go as a domestic to Canada. And 
her...her life, winding up in Canada, is an expe
rience in itself. Terrible experience she had. 
That this was after the war. And I wind 
up going to Hannover, and comi ng to America. 
Except I had the fortune to come on two boats. It
 usually takes the trip between 5 and 6 days 
to come  to America. 21 days. I...I took a boat 
ride for 21 days. What is happen is, I left on 
the Marilyn Marlene
, that lost the rudder in the English 
Channel. And England didn't want to 
take us in. They wouldn't take in a bunch of
 refugees and displaced persons. So we...we 
bounced on the seas; and it was getting rougher 
and rougher. Not enough life preservers. So 
they put the men in the hull, hull with th
e bottom hull. Not enough food. Finally, after all 
those days food ran out. So they only gave us
 Coca-Cola to drink. And the boat was once up, 
once is down. So the glasses--at that time, 
Coca-Cola came in glass bottles--were breaking 
against the hull, against the wall of the thi
ng. And so we were walking on...on glass. When

you walk, you were falling; so we sat. They di
dn't have enough life preservers. So after this, 
I left on Marilyn Marlene
, a ship. A boat, Ernie Pyle
, came. And we transferred on the high 
seas, in the English Channel. Once the boat was here and once the life boat was there; so we 
was bouncing. And under those circumstances, we 
came after 21 days. I made America with 
six dollars in my pocket. And... and I decided 
I gonna start a new life. So I had six dollars 
and a suitcase of books. I had no clothing. So I ha
d a coat ...a coat on. I had a coat and my 
suit on. So I took the coat, and I threw it in the Hudson River. So I said, "If I start with 

nothing, it may as well be everyt
hing nothing."  So I threw my coat on April 1st in the 
Hudson River. I came away with the books a
nd a suit on my back. And that's how I wound 
up in America. And after this... I mean, I got 
a jobs. And uh...my sister was in Canada. And 
she had bad experiences. The problem is, very
 good looking girl. Got a job as a domestic for 
a doctor. Bewildered. Doesn't speak the langua
ge. Doesn't know anything. The first night in 
Canada, he sneaked into her room. Was the 
most shocking experience she ever had. And 
naturally, she made enough noise. Went back 
to the camp, got scared of...of Canadians, 
wants to go back, doesn't  want to stay in Canada because of this experience. Wasn't  raped. 
She wasn't  raped. No, she wasn't  raped. She wa
s...fondled. Uh... But finally she got in touch 
with a doctor...with a Doctor Cohn
 in Hamilton. And they adopted her as a child, as a 
daughter. And ma tter of fact, 
now she consider the boys now as her brothers. And...and 
she...she finally she made quite well. We
nt to school, became supervisor of nursing, 
married...married very poorly, started in busin
ess with two thousand dollars, sold it for 
ma ny, ma ny millions. And she's doing quite well. 
And with me, I...it was a struggle also. 
Comi ng to America was a struggle. Got a 
job. Came  here, and...and because...because a 
friend in the movies--we knew through some
body, through my cousin, knew Eddie Cantor. 
And through Eddie Cantor--I never met him personally. He said since I played with S. S. 
Cuddles
--he was in Hollywood at that time, as S. S. Sagal
. But I don't speak English. He 
said, "You have two chances."  One, I can b
ecome a usher at Radio City Music Hall; or, I 
can become  a waiters some wheres upsta...in one of the Catskill resorts. And I didn't want any 
of those two. I just felt I don't wa
nt to be subservient, somehow. I just...I just didn't want to 
serve. I mean, it through...so through my cousin I got
 a job in S. Klein Department Stores, at 
that time. And I got a job, I think, six days 
a week, 10 hours, a day; because I need hours. 
And I came home with a big 22 dollars a wee
k. And some thing interesting thing is, for 

months I was living on salami  sandwiches. The reason was S. Klein had a cafeteria. I hardly 
spoke English. Matter of fact, if I went to theelevator, if anybody spoke to me  and if I went 
up the elevator, I used to point down. And if I 
went down I used to point up; so long I don't 
have to travel with them, because just in case 
they spoke to me. So I went to the cafeteria. 
And I see on the boards there they have salami . 
I say, "Salami! Salami  in any other language 
has to be Salami ."  And so this was at that
 time a cafeteria; and I go to the window and I say, 

"Salami."  And he says some thing to me . And I don't know what he's talking to me . Except 
by luck there was bread on the...on the counter; 
and he was pointing with his big knife to 
breads. So when finally he got the rye brea
d, I shook my head. So he ma de me  a salami  
sandwich. To ma ke this long story short is, fo
r months I was eating salami  sandwiches and a 
container of milk by the register. They thought 
I was nuts. Because I had a fetish for salami  
sandwiches. So whenever I went, I already had...before I got to them, I had my salami  
sandwich and two containers of milk. And this
 what I lived on--salami sandwiches and two 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0093

containers of milk-- because I didn't speak. So 
eventually, it got better. And my sister lands 
in Canada. So I had to forsake salami  sandwic
hes, because I couldn't afford to eat salami  
sandwiches and send money to my sister. So I 
learned not to eat lunches. And which I still 
doing now, just because...because of my sister
's salami  sandwiches. And...and...and that's 
how I became... And this is my whole escapade,
 I think. Oh. Let me tell you something else. 
When we walked away from the Kruppwerke, we 
went to another...to another camp, at that 
time. Because after bombardment, seems like they
 didn't safe...feel safe, whatever it was. We 
marched through the city. And it's the most am
azing thing is, we marched as a disheveled 
group. I mean skinny, dirty, filthy, no shoes a
nd no nothing. And we ma
rched finally...the 
first time we marched was a German to
wn. There was a most compassionate... 
compassionate people I saw. Not compassi
on in...in outpouring of...of sympathy some . But 
in their faces. In their faces. 
There was no hatred. And they knew, obviously, that we were 
Jewish. I mean, shoulders with the star and a
ll the other garbage on it. They knew about it. 
But they were...they were compassion. There...t
here was humanity in their faces. Which was 
very, very seldom. I never saw it, because I never encountered human...a population itself. 
Only the SS and the soldiers. And I want to say some thing else. I was very hungry when I 

got freed out of the camp. And when I finally 
I got to the camp which they took me as a 
Polak to Poland, to become  a Russian soldier, I was quite hungry. Because the American 

didn't give me...threw the meat to the dog, and 
so forth. I met a Russian soldier. And I don't 
think he looked better than I did. But anyways, he was a Russian soldier. And I was very 
hungry; and I ask him for food. I 
don't know why I ask him for food. So he had a knapsack in 
the back. He opened his knapsack, had a bi
g round bread. Big bread. Big bread. Took his 
knife, took a knife and cut the top of the br
ead--which was ma ybe two...two inches thick. I 
thought, "Oh, my God. This is the biggest meal I ev
er get."  Took this two inches of slice for 
himself, and gave me  the whole bread. That's 
right! So who needs so much bread?  So there 
was... there was a little German fellow there, a little German boy. So I didn't have a knife. So 
I broke my half and I gave him the other half. 
And at that time, I stop hating them. (Crying) 
Yep. 
 
Q: Beno. 
 
A: Yah. 
 
Q: What do you think the effect of...of all this has been on you?  
 
A: Onme ?  
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A:. I don't know what effect it has. I...I don't dwe
ll on the past. Matter of fact, so in all honesty 
I'm doing this just to perpetuate; my childre
n should remember it. I personally, I don't want 
to remember too much. I just can't  dwell on it; b
ecause if I dwell, I have
 to hate. And I have 
no time for that. I absolutely have no time for hating. I mean, it's... my father used to say 
hating is...takes an effort. And I don't want to ta
ke this effort. I'm a firm believer now also,

it's start to pay back. And I'm paying back 
through charity. Not only as much financial 
charity; I mean, it's something I cannot afford. 
I'm involved with the Lubavitcher movement, 
I'm involved with the Holocaust Museum, I'm 
involved with the UJA; but I've become a 
volunteer. I'm a volunteer for an old age home. A
nd I became their feeder. And I go to most 
sickly people who nobody wants to help anymore.
 Because when I took the job... I'm also a 
volunteer in the hospital. And when I took the 
job in the old-age homes, "Most geriatrics," 
the lady said to me, "in the hospital,
 99 percent go home. Here, nobody. Nobody goes 
home."  And they'r e pillars of the society. We have people there which are are vegetables. 
Vegetables. We  have a friend of the lady who us
ed to provide the soaps...soaps for--not only 
soaps--Imogene Coca and Sid Caesar program she writes. We have a editor lady there, was 

editor of the Palm Beach Post
. I mean, we have a young, a fairly young, ma n in the early 50s, 
which is a sculptor--quite a renowned sculptor. 
I mean, it's people, it's...it's...it's unbelievable. 
People who were active. People who were br
ains. People who used them. People who did. 
And the bunch laying there. There [is] Shir
ley...in the fetal position. I mean, it's nothing. 
There's a tremendous gorgeous garden named af
ter her. And it's amazing. So anyways... My 
only problem is... I have a problem with this al
so. I see my mother in them. I don't know why 
I see her. It...(crying)  So sometime I don'
t know if I do it through compassion, or do it 
because I want to cleanse myself. But anyways, it's...it's gratifying. I find it extremely 
gratifying. And I can't  wait to go there. I can
't  wait to go there. And everybody says, "How 
can you do it?  You have to be strong. You have 
to be some thing."  (Softly)  You don't have 
to be at all. You don't have to be at all. (Crying - pause)  It's enough. 
 
Q: Thankyou. 
 
A: Thank you. Oh. (Deep sigh - pause)  Can I me ntion my children?  
 
Q: Yes, please. Bonnie, let's turn the tape back on. 
 
A: Yah. Let me tell you something. There's better stories. 
 
Q: Okay. We 'r e on. Tell us about your children. 
 
A: Let me tell you about my wife. It's a fabulous 
girl. She is a physiotherapist. I...when I worked 
in this S. Klein Department Store, I met a 
fellow who was a buyer for lingerie. His name was 
Carl Boxer
. And I don't know why it possessed me . He 
showed me  a wallet of his. And I 
don't know why me n like to look through wallets. 
He showed me  a wallet, and he showed 
me a picture of a girl sitting on a chair. And I sa
id, "Who is this girl?"  He says, "This is a 
neighbor of mi ne who lives in the same building where I live in Brooklyn."  I said, "Carl, 
this the girl I gonna marry."  He says, "Beno, you 
are nuts!"  I said, "Carl, this is the girl I 
gonna marry."  He said, "Never in a million y
ears. She wouldn't even go out with you."  So 
anyways, on the circumstances by then I hurt my 
back. I was in a cast...in a cast from top to

rst name  was Debbie, my daughter Debbie--who 
plays mommy now in New Jersey; my son, 
David--who is going to become  a daddy in

fellow. I've never met him, by the way. I'm 
going to meet him next week. A fellow from

Stacy. As ma tter of fact, she is going to camp 
this Sunday. And Michael. So life is fairly 

good. Not only fairly good; life is pretty good. So
