Question: This is a 
United States
 Holocaust Memorial 
Museum interview with
 
Fred Firnbacher
, on September 16
th
, 2010, in 
Silver Spring, Maryland,
 in Mr. 
Firnbacher™s 
home, and th ank you very  mu ch for agreeing to  see us, to be re-
interviewed by Œ 
Answer: You™re welcome. 
Q: Œ the 
United Sta tes
 Holocaust Memorial Museum. A
nd I will start with trying to 
lay the groundwork, trying to find out th
e world Œ a little bit about the world you 
were born into. Can you tell me where 
you were born, wh en, your name, your 
parents™ names, and we™ll go from there. 

A: Okay , I was born in 
Reg ensburg
, 
Germany
, wh ich is up the 
Danube
 from 
Straubing
, where my  family lived, probably be
cause they had better medical care 
there than in 
Straubing,
 so it happened there. My name f Œ w Œ at that time was 
Manfred Firnbacher,
 but when I came to 
United States
 and I got my citizenship 
paper, I did not like the Germanic name of 
Manfred
, so I had it legally changed to 
Frederick
, and I took the middle name of 
Stephen
, which is in honor of my 
grandfather. 

Q: I see. W h at year were you born
? What™s the date of your birth? 
A: May 19, 1930.

Q: Do you have brot
hers and siste rs?  
A: No. 
Q: You were an only ch ild. 
A: Yes. 
Q: Was yours a large family? 

A: On my father™s side, my 
father had fourbrot
hers and four sisters, and some of 
them weren™t living any mo re when  I was bor
n, and I was the youngest of about oh, 
seven, eight grandchildren. That™s on my  
father™s side. On my
 mother™s side, my 
mo ther had a sister and a brother. Brothe
r who had a PhD. in chemistry from the 
University of
 Heidelberg
, but due to the situation in 
Germany
, he couldn™t get a 
job there. So he emigrated to 
Holland
, and he worked for 
Organon,
 which is the 
big pharmaceutical company ther
e. And he was part of th
e earl Œ original research 
for the conjugated estrogens. 

Q: I see. Could you spell the name of th
at research company so that we can Œ 
A: 
Organon, o-r-g-a-n-o-n. 
Q: 
Organon, 
okay. 
A: And they™re in Œ located in a place called 
Oss, o-s-s
, in 
Holland. 
Q: What was Œ what was your father™s pr
ofession, or wh at Œ how did he make a 
living?

A: My father was a cattle and horse deale
r. He would buy cattle from farmers, resell 
it to other farmers. He™d buy cattle to be 
slaughtered. As far as the horses went, he 
would go every year at the German-
Belgiu m
 border, where they ha
d a type of horse 
like the 
Clydesdale
, heavy work  horses. He would 
buy them as colts, transport 
them to 
Bavaria
 and then resell them to 
farmers, who raised them. 
Q: Tell Œ can you tell me Œ th-this is just 
pure coincidence. This mo rning we had an 
interview with somebo
dy whose father was also in 
the cattle market business. Was 
this a fai Œ was this an area of
 activity that there were more
 Jews than in other areas, 
or was this just a pure coincidence that we were Œ 
A: I think was Œ that I Œ I don™t know fo
r a fact, but I think a lot of Jews, for 
instance, our family, my father and his fa
ther were Œ worked together. An uncle by 
the name of 
Solomon Firnbacher
 also was in the cattle and horse business in 
Regensburg, 
which is a little way up the da Œ
 Danube
. There were more 
Firnbachers 
in the cattle and horse business, 
and they more or less worked 
together. And I was told that they had the largest cattle business in 
Bavaria. 

Q: I see. O k ay, okay, so that Œ it gives us
 a little bit of sense of the wider context. 
A: I don™t know how true it is about th
e size of it, but that™s what I heard. 
Q: Okay. And your mother, wa
s she involv ed in her Œ your dad™s business as well, 
or wa Œ

A: Well no, she was just a regular housewife. 
Q: Okay . 

A: And the funny thing is, her fa
th er was in the horse business. 
Q: What was her name? 

A: Her name Œ her name is 
Ida Luchs
.

A: 
I-d-a

 l-u-c-h-s. 
Q: 
L-u-c-h-s
. And your father™s first name w as? 
A: 
Maier. M-a-i-e-r. 
Q: 
Maier Firnbacher, 
okay. Would you say that your family was a well-to-do 
family? 

A: Well, as a child I woul
dn™t know that mu ch about 
finance then, but we were 
pretty well off, I would think. 

Q: Did you have nannies, did you have servan ts at home? 
A: Yes. 
Q: Did you have housekeep
ers and things like that? 
A: Yes. 
Q: Yeah. What are some of your 
earliest memo ries from your ch ildhood?

A: Well, my mother was from a v illage in 
Buttenwiessen
 which was also in
 
Bavaria
, wh ich was a good distance aw
ay, and we used to go to 
Buttenwiessen
 
frequently . 
Q: 
Buttenwiessen
? 
A: Yes. It™s 
b-u-t-t-e-n-w-i-e-s-s-e-n. 
Q: Was it a fun thing fo r a child to do wh en you went to 
Buttenwiessen
? 
A: Well, I never got there after I was four
 years old because my  grandfather died 
and Grandma came to  live with us. 
Q: Ah, I see. So it was Œ it was something 
that happened only in  those first four 
years of your life? 
A: Yes. 
Q: And what me mo ries do you have of
 Buttenwiessen? 
A: My cousin and I, who Œ who was Œ he was 
a year and a half older, we went with 
my  grandfather to Œ one time while he wa
s out selling a horse or something, and 
there was a very steep place there, which is  made out of concrete and we use it like 

a slide and we slid down. I Œ th ey did some
thing that they considered impossible, I 
got home in leather pants. 
Q: So you Œ did you wear 
lederhosen
? 
A: Yeah.

Q: That is a very Œ I mean, that™s quite an
 achievement, cause t
hose are tough pieces 
of leather there. Any other memories 
from that time, of your grandfather Œ 
A: Well, I re Œ I remember the first 
Seders
 I went to. 
Q: Mm-hm, what were they like? 
A: They were just a lot of fun. 

Q: Well, tell somebody who™s not Jewish a little bit about 
Seders
 in 
Germany
 at 
that time, cause I wouldn™t know. 
A: Well Œ well, the family came together an
d there was a lot of 
singing, lot of good 
food, and we went through the whole 
Haggadah. 
Q: A-And that is a prayer? 

A: The 
Haggadah 
is the prayer book th
at they use for the 
Seder. 
Q: I see. Okay, thank you. And is thi Œ wa
s this something that was very traditional? 
Was your family a very religious family? 

A: Yeah, we were brought up Orthodox. 
Q: I see. O k ay. And wa Œ was that somethin
g that almost  all Jews in small er cit i es 
and town s would Œ 
would observe?  
A: Well, I don™t know about Œ ca
use I was just a little one, so Œ 
Q: Yeah.

A: Œ I don™t know. In  
Stra ubing
 we had one synagogue an it was Orthodox and 
Buttenwiessen
 was one synagogue and that was Orthodox. In  fact, 
Buttenwiessen
 
at the turn of the century , that™s back in 1900, wa
s about 70 percent Jewish. 
Q: Did you have any contact 
with Gentile Germans at a
ll? Do you remember, from 
ger Œ 
A: Oh yeah, when Œ when I wa
s in school, in the first grad
e, I was entered into the Œ 
well, it was called the Protestant school. I 
was entered there and there were just two 
of us in the class, two Jewish children. 
The other one was a girl who Œ who I happen 
to know cause we grew up together, we 
were the same age. And I had the lovely 
experience of being expelled from school in
 th e first grade because I hit a Nazi 
child and I was too dangerous
 to be left with them. 
Q: Oh dear, and yo
u were how old? 
A: Six. 
Q: And di-did you know th e full 
reasons why this was happening? 
A: Well, yeah, th-the wa Œ w-we Œ we knew
 that, being Jewish that we were just 
being hit upon and it just so happened this 
child was about three years older than me 
and a foot taller, and he started picking on
 me. So my dad being in the cattle and 
horse business, I ran into the house, got 
a horsewhip an d hit him once with it. And 
there is a picture of me with 
the horsewhip way up on top.

Q: Oh, we will take a look at that photog
raph later. And Œ and that was enough to 
make that happen. 
A: Yes. 
Q: And that was Œ 
A: And I was out of school, my  par Œ pare
nts protested and what
 does a kid know, 
and after six weeks, after a lot of red tape
 going th rough the Œ with th e Œ with  the 
German government, the Œ I finally was allo
wed to go back to school. And at the 
end of the year, all the Jewish 
kids were expelled from the school. 

Q: So th is would ha
ve been 1935 - ™36? 
A: Thirty si Œ 30 s Œ either ™36 or ™37. I 
started school in ™36, so I don™t know what 
was Œ 

Q: Yeah, probably Œ 

A: Œ after new year, probably ™37.  

Q: Was that Œ is that your mo st vivid me
mo ry of coming Œ yo
u know, sort of like 
head on in to Nazism and you 
know, when  you experience it, or did you have other 
things that Œ 

A: Well, you could walk down  the street 
Œ I mean, my parents ar Œ I w Œ I was Œ 
they let me go on the streets by my se
lf and I™d see German storm troopers, 
SS
 men ,  
SA 
men walking on the streets, and I Œ I was 
just a kid, so they didn™t know who I

was, so I just walked everywhere, I Œ othe
r things that I remember is, when I was 
expelled Œ after we were all expelled 
from school we had an
 older man who had 
been a schoolteacher in his younger year
s, this time he was the top man of the 
synagogue, he Œ we didn™t 
have a rabbi, it wasn™t a large enough co ngregation to 
have a rabbi, but he led all the serv ices, 
he taught the ch ildren Hebrew  in Hebrew 
school, and since he™d been a teacher, the 
parents all got together and said, you™ve 
got to teach these children. And from the 
second grade on I was in a one room 
schoolhouse til later. Now, othe
r things I remember when I was in that school. One 
day the door was kicked open
, German storm trooper at the door, class dismissed. 
Didn™t say anything, everybody go home. An
d I went home along the street. Half an 
hour after I was home we saw the troo
ps going through th
e street for the 
anschluss
 
in 
Austria
. We were right near the border th
ere. German troops just coming 
through the city, just truckload after truc
kload. And I guess they were going in the 
railroad station too, the tr
ains were heading all for 
Austria
. And by the next day we 
saw them coming back already, 
cause they had taken all of 
Austria
 so raptly. Then 
I remember another time, I 
was d o wntown in the Œ in
 Stra ubing
 and I saw a bunch 
of tanks coming, loads of Œ one tank afte
r another, mu st have been  hundreds of 
them, and they were heading for the 
Sudetenland
, for the 
anschluss
 there. 
Q: For the Czechoslovakian Œ

A: For th e Czechoslo vakian. So  I saw both of those invasions. 
Q: Oh my  goodness. Oh my  goodness, becaus
e yes, they were on the way, wa Œ wa 
Œ wh ere you lived Œ 
A: Right, we were right in the corner Œ 
Q: Œ in 
Bavaria
, you were there, yeah. 
A: Œ where 
Czechoslovakia
, 
Austria
 and 
Germany
 came together, we lived right 
in that little corner. 
Q: And were people in the town  saying yes, we™re going to Œ
 Austria
 will now be 
part of us, is that Œ 
A: Well, not so much they 
ev  Œ wh en they  were down 
there they looked rather 
scared, like going into battle, not knowing 
what™s going to happ
en. The next day 
when  they  were coming back , or next 
few days, they were rather jubilant. 
Q: Did Œ do you Œ did you no
tice, or did your parents ta
lk about neighbors or your 
father™s business being affected in Œ in 
all of Œ you know, in all of what was 
happening at that time? 

A: Well, he was Œ with the
 Nuremburg
 laws, I guess it was, Jews weren™t allowed 
to have businesses any mo re, so he just had 
to stop. That was it, he had to ju st get 
rid of all the cattle and horses he had.  

Q: So how did you live? 

 
Interview with Fred

13
A: Well, I guess they had me
ans with which to live. 
Q: So was probably savings. 
A: Oh yeah. 
Q: Just what would have been saved up, 
and nothing. Di-Did 
you Œ okay. Did Œ did 
you notice Œ I mean, you were a 
young child at the time, but
 children feel things Œ 
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: Œ very  often. Did you notice somethin
g happening in your parents™ demeanor 
towards one another, toward s you Œ 

A: No, th ey Œ 

Q: Œ to the outside? 
A: No, th ey Œ they ju st mo re or less indoctr
inated me to be care
ful when I go in the 
street and not to mingle too mu ch
 with Œ with the other kids. 
Q: Were there other incidents from other kids, aside from that one Œ one boy Œ 
A: Well, that™s the only one that I really know about. 
Q: Mm-hm, that you remember. 
A: Mm-hm. 

Q: Yeah. Did you ev er have any other 
German Œ did you have German friends? 

 
Interview with Fred

September 16, 2010 
 

 
 
14
A: My parents had some German friends, bu
t as times went on 
they  Œ they  didn™t 
have that much to do with
 them. More or less stayed 
with the Jewish people who 
were in town. 
Q: What else can you tell us about what ha
ppened afterwards? After you were in the 
school, how long did th
at school exist? Was that at so
me point also closed down or 
not?  
A: Well, Crystal Night, that was the end of
 it. Crystal Night th
ey broke into the 
synagogue, and wh ere Œ there was one room
 in there, schoolroom, wh ich they  used 
before for Hebrew school, was that got to 
be our classroom, and of course with the 
Œ everybody having been arrested and being sent to 
Da cha u
, there was no more 
school, and that was it, they Œ 

Q: Is that what happened afterwards is 
that not only was the build ing broken into, 
but those who were involved  were sent to 
Dach au
? 
A: Yeah, all th Œ all the men and the ne Œ 
well, on Crystal Night they  broke in to the 
synagogue, they tried to 
break into our house, but th
e door was so strong they 
couldn™t break in, and one of
 the neighbors across the st
reet hollered out of his 
window, let those people alone, they haven™
t done anything to  you, or something of 
that nature, and they  went 
away. And in the morning, 
they Œ the police came to

arrest my  father, to put him under protective 
custody, and three days later he was in 
Dach au
. 
Q: Oh my. Did you see them 
arrest him? Did you see Œ 
A: I was upstairs and I just 
heard Œ heard them downstairs. 
Q: That mu st have been
 terrifying for a child. 
A: It was terrifying. And my mother had 
nerv e enough to go every day up to  the 
police station as long as he was there. Th
ey  allowed her to visit Œ well, n-not to 
actually visit him, to bring him things lik
e warm clothing and stuff like that, and 
they passed that on to him. 
Q: And how long was he in 
Da cha u
? 
A: Three weeks. And that 
Œ he would have 
gotten out after four week s anyhow, 
because all veterans from Worl
d War I were released from 
Dach au
 at that time. But 
my  mo ther had heard th at somebody went
 to the Gestapo and asked for their 
husband to be released, next day he came  
in. So Mother said, we
ll, what can I lose? 
So she took the train to
 Regensburg, 
asked fo r his release and couple of days later, 
here he was at home. 

Q: Did he look changed? 
A: Well, he looked gaunt 
and they took the clothing
 and everything away from 
them, put them in these uniforms lik
e you s-see from the prisoners in 
Auschwitz

and ev erywhere. And it was cold of wint
er and th ey had on something ab out the 
warmth of a pajama. 
Q: Yeah, of course, I mean, because 
Kristallnacht
 was in November. 
A: Mm-hm. 

Q: And Œ and Œ and it was cold. 

A: And it was very cold in 
Europe. 
Q: Yeah. Did he talk about wh at had gone on in 
Da cha u
? 
A: Well he di Œ said some of the things like when they Œ they
 taunted them when 
they got off the buses there. They  had hos
es and stuff and they sw ung at them and 
they made them run here and there and everything. 
Q: Your language at home I take 
it, was only German. Is that so? 
A: Well, that™s all we could speak, b
ecause that Œ that was our native tongue. 
Q: Okay. No Yiddish, or Œ 

A: No. 
Q: No. Wh-What Œ did things

your father came home, as 
far as how they were thinking

A: Well, we already had our visas and everything to come to the 
United States
, so

September 16, 2010 
 

 
 
17
A: Œ we Œ we Œ everything had been plan
ned. He got home in early December of 
™38, and we had our appointment with th
e American consulate in January, first 
week in January. And we went to 
Stuttgart
 to the consulate and of course 
somebody, on purpose I guess, instead of 
putting the date 1939
 on one of the 
papers, ™38, so that slowed everything down,
 my  father had to go back and fo rth. So 
they used  to come by every other day just
 about to pick up your
 passport and take it 
away from you. So  there would be no ch
ance of them getting our passport, we 
didn™t come home from 
Stuttgart
. We went from there to 
Aug sburg
, stayed with 
relatives over the weekend, and first thi
ng on Monday mo rning, my  dad took the 
train to 
Straubing, 
went to get the date changed on 
that paper, went from there to 
Stuttgart
, got Œ saw the American consulate, got
 everything straight, picked  us up 
late at night in 
Aug sburg
, we took th Œ in the ni
ght, the train back to 
Straubing.
 
And the next train that left for
 Holland, 
we were on it to get out of the country. 
Q: So you didn™t waste any time Œ 
A: No. 
Q: Œ after he came back from 
Kristallnacht
. 
A: My Œ my  uncle, who had become ill a
nd he was an invalid, and he couldn™t get 
around any mo re, so my mo the
r™s sister lived with him,
 she was divorced. And she 
and her son lived in 
Holland
 and took care of my  uncle so we had a place where to

stay til they shipped Œ becaus
e ba Œ my dad alre
ady had tickets before even Crystal 
Night, for us to leave 
Germany
 on January 28
th
 of 1939. 
Q: And did you know Œ being a ch ild, 
did you know of all these plans? 
A: Oh yeah. 
Q: Okay , so they Œ they  we
re talking about that at hom
e, there was already we™re 
not staying here, even before 
Kristallnacht
. You know, the Œ 
A: Well, to get out of 
Germany
, you just couldn™t say we™re gonna leave. 
Q: Of course not. 

A: You had to have pa
perwork, and th e Œ the 
United States
 had a quota, how many 
people from each country that they would 
accept. So it was like getting a number in 
the delicatessen counter, you had to have 
a numb er, in the order of your number, 
you were called to
 Stuttgart.
 An d we knew that it was January  sixth that we were 
to appear there. 
Q: And that wasn™t yet certain that you 
would be able to go
 when you appeared 
there, or was it? It was a more f Œ  more or less a formality. 

A: It was va Œ well, we ha
d to pass phy Œ physical exam, 
they weren™t going to take 
just anybody to come to 
United States
. 
Q: And were y Œ was your family able
 Œ yo-you Œ you left everything, then. 

 
Interview with Fred

19
A: We were allowed to take, I think it was 250 marks, German money. Or was it Œ 
then two fi Œ I think it was 250 marks per person, that™s all the money we were 

allowed to take with us. 
Q: Were you able to take any ot
her items? Did you take any toys? 
A: Oh yeah, in Œ once we knew that we were
 leaving, in fact, before we even went 
to the consulate, we had a big van Œ it™
s like Œ like they were
 years ahead, it was 
like the Œ today the containers that they Œ sh
ips things, we were able to take all of 
our furniture and stuff with us. But, th
ey had to  be insp ected by th e German 
government. They put a valu
e on every item,  and you ha
d to pay a tax of that 
amount to th em. 

Q: For your own stuff. 
A: For your Œ for your own stuff. 

Q: And so did you pretty mu
ch leave an empty house? 
A: Well, my grandmother was 
still there. She Œ she wasn™t
 with us, so she was there 
in the apartment. And as th
e different apartments vacated, my  grandmother was able 
to go to 
Holland
 and th en stay with her daughter, 
she was able to do that. In fact, 
she was in 
Holland
 wh en the Germans invaded. 
Q: What happened to  her?

Holland
 stayed there, he didn™t Œ

uncle who had had plans 
or Œ or talk of also trying to
 get out, or they  just didn™t 
have the way of doin g it, or Œ 
A: Well, the lot of them didn™t, they had to 
have, first of all an affid avit, someone to 
sponsor them 
to come to 
United States
. And a lot of people even
 if they didn™t have 
that yet, they got themselves a number, and 
a lot of them did have the affidavits, but 

the war broke out Œ

re go Œ the train was going to ward  the 
border, German
 SS
 men came through, they were 
inspecting people and hoping th at 
they wouldn™t call you out. And we saw them passing by our comp artment and they 

seemed to bypass us. All of sudden we
 heard the con Œ the conductors going 
through speaking Du tch. They™d  been 
at the border, the Germans were gone, the

Dutch were in, and we opened th e window 
and we spit out the Swiss Œ the end of 
Germany
. 
Q: Fitting. And tell me now about the Tora
h story that you were talking about. 
What was that, how does it Œ what was the 
beginning of it, how did it develop Œ 
A: Okay . On  Crystal Night they  broke into  the synagogue. 

Q: Right. 

A: It was a bunch of thugs. They  came and 
ransacked th e place. They  couldn™t burn 
it because it was in a residential area and 
they couldn™t get permission from the fire 
department to burn the syna
gogue down. So they ransac
ked ev erything and I did see 
the results of it, and I™ve never seen such
 a mess of tot al dest
ruction, like a bomb 
had hit the place. And when  wi Œ th ey 
Œ they  came in, ju st about destroyed 
everything. When  my  
father came back from 
Dach au
, he had Œ we had Œ we were 
ready to leave 
Germany
, we were ready to pack everything. And on the list of 
items we were permitted to take out was th
e Torah. So  he went to the Gestapo and 
he showed them papers where he was, 
could he get his Torah back? The Torah Œ 
Q: This was the synagogue™s Torah? 

A: That was his Torah, it was af Œ  
Q: Oh, it™s his Torah. 

 
Interview with Fred

A: Œ i-it was Œ it was in Œ our family™s
 Torah. That was 
written by my great-
grandfather, which is anot
her story. And an yway Œ 
Q: We™ll hear that then, maybe. 
A: Anyway, he went there to get the Tora
hs, he was Œ there was jus Œ he was told. 
And when he got there, there was a room th
at had Torahs and prayer books, all kind 
of religious material just laying in a big 
heap . Well, he picked
 up his Torah and he 
saw all these others there, being desecrated
 through Œ th e Torah™s supposed to  be Œ 
always be standing up. So he took all th
e Torahs and stood th em up. And he saw a 
box there, so he took one Torah, he put it 
into this box, and he
 took the silverware 
that was there, the breastplate, th e Œ the 
silver hand an d the crown and he put all 
that into the box, and he closed the box up
. Well, I am not sure, 
but the Œ when they 
found this Torah after the war, there in the box with all 
that, it had to be the Torah 
my father had put in there, cause what pr
obably happened
, I surmise that they came 
Œ the Gestapo came by to pick up all these 
items, and there™s this box there, they 
didn™t look in it, and it was left. A nd so
mebody probab ly would say, oh my  God, 
there™s Torahs here. If they 
catch me with this
, they™re going to 
cut my head off, 
send me a concen tration camp  or do so meth
ing. So th ey headed fo r the war, and 

after the war was over, they discreetly brought
 it back and just left it there. And I 
have a hunch that™s what happened, but from 
what they said the Torah Œ th-the box

looked like Œ of what

Q: And when was it discovered? Was it like 
returned right after the war, or se Œ 
A: After Œ

A: But in the film you don™t get that, beca

up, cause they just asked me about our 
Torah, the story of it, and Œ 

Q: And when you™re talking now, you™re

actually after the war, in 
1989, so much
 later.  
Q: Okay . 
A: And you™ve got the Œ the film there, so 
you can go through it and see it, it™s all in 
German. And an yway, you want to 
know the story about the Torah. 
Q: Right. 
A: Well, my great-grandfather, 
Moses Firnbacher
, was in the 
United States
, and 
he hit gold in 
the goldrush in
 ninet Œ 1849. 
Q: Oh my. 

A: And he took his belongings, his rich
es from the goldrush, brought it back to 
Germany
, to 
Gossmannsdorf
 wh ere the family lived, and like any other young 
man, he got married there, started a busin
ess, and he had child
ren of his own, and 
the oldest was my  grandfather, 
Joseph Firnbacher. 
And for his Bar Mitzvah he 
wanted to have a Torah written. Since he™d 
gotten all this gold, he
 had wealth. So he 
had a Torah written, and they 
brought the Torah scribe, a 
sofer 
into the house, and 
he lived with them for a whole year, and 
every week he wrote 
that week™s portion 
for the Torah, til it was finish
ed, for my grandfather™s Bar Mitzvah. And this, when

Straubing,
 my  grandfather went there, I guess, for greener pastures 
or exactly what I don™t know. I wasn™t around yet then .  
Q: Yeah. 
A: And they  went to
 Straubing,
 the Torah came with them
 and then my father was 
Bar Mitzvahed from it and it belonged 
to the family and when we left 
Germany

we Œ we brought it with us.

carrying a Torah through the streets of Nazi 
Germany

whi Œ it was a brave thing. Bu t I have a hunc

I didn™t realize it snowed here in the

letters with something blacked out, or 
cut out. Every piece of mail we got was 
censored, even before th

 I was in the army, I 
didn™t want to go to 
Korea
, and it just 
so happen s that I knew a few people in personnel at Fort
 Bennin g, Georgia
, and I 
mentioned to them if they ever 
have a levy for somebody with my  
MOS, 
which is a 
pharmacist™s 
MOS
, I would be very happy to go to  
Germ any
, yeah, I just did not 
want to go to 
Korea.
 So before I knew it, here
 I had orders to go to 
Germany
. 
Q: And where were you based? 
A: I was Œ first we arrived in 
Bremerhaven
, and from there we were shipped down  
to 
Zw eibrucken
, where all the tro ops were disseminated all over 
Germany
. Now, 
Zw eibrucken 
was very interesting. They had 
us take our patches off of our 
unifo rms so they couldn™t te
ll where we came from in the 
United States
 because it 
Œ it was still the height of the Co ld War. So  a Œ I was hoping I would be sent to 

Frankfurt
 where the general hospital, I was h opi
ng to  be stationed there. I think it 
was the 97
th
 general hospital, I™m not sure any mo re the number. And lo  and behold 
the orders came down, 97
th
 general hospital, 
Frankfurt
. I was so happy because 
Frankfurt
 was the center, I knew I could travel all over 
Germany
 once I got there. 
We got to there, said we have no need 
for pharmacists here. 
If you want to stay 
here, you Œ we can put you in th e mo tor p
ool. Well, being a young pharmacist just 
out of school, I™m not going to  get my  fingern
ails dirty in the mo tor pool. So  I was Œ 
we were transferred to triple seven nine

the place was covered like a forest, becaus

there, were testing, I believe there, buzz 
bombs that they were

A: Well, the first trip I made Œ well, actually, I got there in September, so it was 
right befo re the Jewish holid ays. 

Q: Right. 
A: So I was not very popular, when soon as 
I got there I es Œ I wa
nted to go for the 
holid ays, wh ere do you go? I™m new there. So I was told that 
Würzburg 
was the 
closest place, so I got a three day pass for the Œ 
Rosh Hashanah. 
And th en fo r 
when 
Yom Kippur 
came, I went back ther
e. But they saw that 
Œ cause I told them, 
I™m taking off for this 
[indecipherable]
 Christmas I Œ I™ll do all that sort of stuff. 
So I Œ so  I Œ th-they realized that it was 
religious reason, not that I was goofing off. 
Q: Right. 
A: So my first trip I did was to 
Mu n i ch
 fo r another reason, because my  
grandmother had a very  good 
friend who survived the Holo
caust, and sh e was in the 
home for the aged in 
Munich
. And so  I go to visit her, what can I take a woman 
who is in her 80s, what can I bring her?  

Q: Of course. 
A: I™m thinking, I™m thinking. Guess what
 I came up with? Cigarettes. She could Œ 
with cigarettes she could get anything. 
Q: Of course, of course, of course. So yo
u bring an 80 year old 
pack s of cigarettes. 
A: Brought her a carton of cigarettes.

Q: Yeah. 
A: Greatest present. She was so appreciativ
e. Well, once my moth er found out that 
this woman was living, we™d send her pack
ages. S o  w h en  th e p a ck ag es w e n t  ov er 
they were plundered before 
she got them. So I got the great idea, I™m going to  write 

on the outside of the p
ackage, gift parcel. The word g-
i-f-t gift is the German word 
for poison. And every packag e went through. 

Q: Really? But Œ but, you 
know, how mean. You know, a 
parcel goes to an old 
woman in  a nursing home Œ 

A: Yes. 

Q: Œ and it Œ and it™s pulled apar
t and si Œ you know, stolen Œ 
A: Right. 

Q: Œ befo re she even gets Œ yo
u know, before it gets to her. 
A: And w-we Œ we sent her stuff like soap
, toothpaste, stuff like that, which they 
couldn™t get.  
Q: Of course. 
A: I mean, you couldn™t send Œ we could 
send some canned goods, but you couldn™t 
send anything else because if
 you Œ it would perish by th
e time it would get there. 
Q: So, your first trip was to 
Munich.
 During that same th
ree day pass, did you 
make it down to
 Straubing
?

Q: Mm-hm. 
A: Œ thro ugh Œ I went along with troo Œ the railroad ways. 
Q: Okay . 
A: So 
Buttenwiessen
, I decided to stop there in the 
morning. In fact, I got off the 
train in 
Donauwerth,
 which was where the train went, the train didn't go to
 
Buttenwiessen. 
So I got out of there and had lunc
h, and I got a cab driver there, 
standing at the railroad station. How 
mu ch you charge me to take me to 
Buttenwiessen
 and bring me back? Twenty -five ma
rks. Fine. I say, I™m going to 
have lunch and then  I want you to take me to 
Buttenwiessen. 
I get to 
Buttenwiessen
, the first thing I ask, where do we find the 
Bürgermeister? 
The Œ 
the mayor. 
Q: Right. 

A: So we found him. They™re
 all farmers. In fact, in 
those days he probably Œ he 
probably  couldn™t even  sign his name. They
 weren™t that educated. So I said, I™d 
like to see my  grandfather™s house, which 
way, and I™d like to go to the cemetery. 
Got to th e cemetery, I had a picture of my
 grandfather™s tomb stone, so I knew what 
it looked like. I found the tomb ston
e, everything on it was erased. 

Q: Really?

A: I went in Œ my mother 
said, when you go in the door
 to the cemetery, you turn 
right and it™s the third grave. It wasn™t 
there, I found it some
where else. They had 
taken all the tomb stones out, they had pl
undered them, they we
re going to reuse 
them. And they took the names 
[indeciphera ble]
. Wh en war ended, they brought 
them back, the one they still had, just put
 them anywhere. So that was the story 
there. So I told them wher e I wanted the tombstone, I wanted it re-engraved, and of 

course I wrote my  dad and he sent them a 
very nice letter. I should say not so nice. 
Q: Pardon? 

A: I should say not so nice. 

Q: Nis Œ yeah. 
A: And tha-that took care of that. 
Then  from there I went Œ stopped in 
Aug sburg
. I 
just wanted to see the house that my  uncle had, he was in 
New York
, and I just Œ it 
was on th e 
Bahnhofstrasse
, so it™s right down the street
 from the railroad station. I 
just stopped long en ough to  find th e place, to 
see what it looked like, take a picture 
of it and depart and then  from there I went to 
Munich
 and I spent the weekend there 
and then  I had to get back to base. 
Q: So you Œ but the impression I get is that
 you looked at buildings and s Œ graves. 
A: Right.

Q: And yo Œ and yet, 10 year
s earlier, or 12 years earlier,
 you wouldn™t have known

When  I signed my  last name the Œ the cle Œ the desk clerk there recognized th e last 
name. He said, you any relation to so and

cemetery, our old house, my  uncle™s house. 
And my  father had a lawyer already in 
Germany
 who was handling a lot of his papers,

Q: Why would that even  matter? 
A: Because I™m not a paratrooper, that™s military Œ

were holding, who they
 were marching from

Germany
, and he was 
released in 
Cham, c-h-a-m
, is the name of the place. And he told me about ther Œ 
anyway, they had built a memo
rial to these people. They wouldn™t allow them to 
give them food, or wouldn™t let them ha
ve water. The people in town came by to 
help them, and the 
SS
 just told the people, get out, 
leave these people alone. And a 
lot of them died there, and there was a me
mo rial which is a wa
ter fountain, and had 
the word water written  on it in all different languages,

throw bottles at each other, and we™d pick 
them up and they™d bring them up to the

But his business, the properties he owned.

Dachau
 saying 
that that was his thanks from the fath
erland for his service in World War I. 
Q: Well, that™s enough to make you bitter. 
Is there anything else you™d like to add, 

that we haven™t talked about, that you th
ink is important for people to know in th e 
future? 
A: Well, the Œ the important thing is to ke
ep faith and do the be
st you can, and like 
some things in 
Germany
, I Œ y-you can™t Œ just can™t 
forgive, it™s just something 
that they did to you. A
nd like when  I went to 
Germany
, all the other
 G.I.s
, they 
were going out with German gi
rls, I wouldn™t go out with 
any of them, I didn™t want 
to have an ything to 
do with anybody, for 
tho Œ for those reasons. 
Q: Was your religion Œ was your re
ligious belief stronger afterwards? 
A: Not Œ 
Q: Did it get shaken 
[indeciphera ble]
 change? 
A: Not Œ it doesn  Œ wasn™t necessarily stronger, no. 
Q: No. But there are some people also, I kno
w, who lost their religious belief after 
the war.

A: Yeah, that™s some p eople, but a Œ no, 
I™m ver Œ very Œ I™m 
Œ I™m n o t Œ I™m not 
Orthodox. We go to Conservative services
. We Œ we don™t eat 
pork products, things 
like that. But Œ but we Œ we believe that
 we™re Jewish, but we™re not fanatically 
Jewish. 
Q: My Œ my point of this is
 that a lot of people who have
 been through some of the 
Holocaust experiences lost thei r faith in God as a result. 

A: No, no. 
Q: No. That Œ well, those were 
two separate things for you. 
A: Right. Like, I™m very active here with the Jewish residents of 
Leisure World.
 
Last Œ last week on

Night program here,

sabbatical this year. Then Passover I Œ 
they found somebody
 who knows how to 
lead a 
Seder
, so I led the

Q: Wow. Well, this is again, a 
question that I asked before, are 
Seders
 generally 
traditionally celebrated within a circle, 
a small circle, a family circle, or a 
community one? 
A: This is a  community one.
 Most everybody goes with 
their fami l y  on the first 
night, so on the second night Œ 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Œ we have Œ we have 
here what they call second
 Seder.
 I™ve run the show for the 
last four years. I™ve done a lot of things to
 liven it up. I™ve gone on the internet and 
gotten parodies for f-famous songs,
 which a Œ which are funny, like 
Clementine Œ 

Q: Oh yeah. 
A: Œ songs like that. Like we started off the 
Seder
, there™s this tune, if 
There™s No 
Business Like Show Business, 
and started off, there™s n o  
Seder 
like our 
Seder. 
When we go back after the meal to  
finish off the second half of the 
Seder,
 I started 
off, instead of 
Take Me Back to the Ballgame, 
take me back to the 
Seder. 
And 
I™ve put in  about a half a dozen or mo re 
songs, and they  enjoy that. I have them 
printed up, the song sheets,
 and they™re at all the ta
bles, and they  sing along. 
Q: We Œ a person need s a mast
er of ceremonies like that. 

A: So I-I™ve Œ I™ve livened
 it up quite a bit.

Seders
 that run til 11 o™clock, 12 o™clock at
 night, they drag 
everything out. Mine 
is, they wouldn™t Œ didn™t believe me, I 
said, I™ll have you ea
ting dinner within 30 
minutes. And we did. 
Q: And you did. Wh at woul
d you want the people of 
Straubing
 to know about your 
family? 

A: I really don™t care. We were there, we
 sent them a few things and Œ for their 
synagogue, they Œ lik
e a little museum, whatev
er they wanted to 
build, I sent them 
some things and I never h
eard much from them, so Œ 
Q: Okay . 
A: It Œ it™s changed.
 Straubing 
was originally, it was German Jews. After the war it 
was Polish Jews, and now it™s all Russian Jews.

Interview with Fred

September 16, 2010 
 

 
 
64
Q: I™m jumping ahead, but around 
Kristallnacht Œ 
at this point, befo re 
Kristallnacht, 
before November of 1938, did your 
parents start to get their affairs 
in orders to get out? Had they
 already signed for a quota? 
A: We Œ we had Œ we had re
latives over here. In fact, in the family over here there 
was Œ there was the 
Luchs
 family Œ are you Œ are yo
u a native Washingtonian? 
Q: No. 
A: No? Cause there used to be a 
st Œ a real estate company here, 
Shannon 
and 
Luchs
. 
Q: Mm-hm. 

A: And the 
Luchs
 family was a very large family, 
and about half of them came to 
the 
United States
 way back, and a lot of them 
came at later dates, and the 
offsprings etcetera. There was a R abbi 
Luchs
 in 
Dav enpo rt, Io wa
, and he saw to it 
that everybody in th e family had to give 
some sort of affidavit to try to get the 
people out. And that™s how we got
 out, and wh at happened was, in 
Germany
 the 
American consulate of course had a quota, 
so we got a numb er, just like you go to 

the delicatessen Œ 

Q: Right. 
A: Œ wh en you would go in , there™s the number 
that we had to go to the consulate in 
Stuttgart
.

Q: So you had this 
in July 
of 1938? 
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: But it hadn™t come up before 
Kristallnacht
? 
A: No. 

Q: What happened on 
Kristallnacht
? 
A: Well, 
Kristallnacht
, well, alo ng with this Œ well, 
we went to the hotel that we 
were staying at before we went
 to the American consulate in 
Stuttgart, 
this was in 
our hotel room, in other words since Œ sinc
e you™re not an  Aryan, you™re expected 
to eat your meals in the r
oom, you can™t go into the Œ 

Q: Dining room. 
A: So I thought that would be of interest. 
Q: It is. So, do you remember 
this trip to the consulate? 
A: Yeah. I remember one thing, my parent
s were so worried that we wouldn™t get 
out, cause I had a terrible cough, and it™s 
Œ they thought maybe the doctors might 
reject me because I had this
 cough that the Œ I might ha
ve bronchitis or something. 
So when we were there, ev
erything was in order except 
for one thing. My father 
doesn ™t know wh ether it was an accident or
 wh ether they did it on purpose, they put 
the year, it was just after the first of th
e year, it was in Janua
ry, instead of putting 
the date 1939, they  put 1938.
 And so they  wouldn™t give 
us our papers to come out. 

 
Interview with Fred
 Firnbacher   
September 16, 2010 
 

 
 
66
So, we didn™t want to get 
to stop, because they  always
 would come by and pick up 
our passports, then we had a hard
 time getting the passports back. 
Q: Right. 
A: So my dad left us with Œ my 
mother and me with relatives in 
Augsburg.
 We 
stayed there the int Œ thisis on Friday, so we stayed 
there all weekend. When Dad 
took the first train Monday mo rning to  
Straubing, 
never went to our house, went 
straight to the authorities, wherever he had to go to get this corrected. Then he got 

the next train to 
Stuttgart, 
went to  the consulate, got the papers, came back and 
picked th is up at Œ in  
Aug sburg , 
we went back  to 
Stra ubing
 that night, and we got 
everything in order, we th Œ all the pack
ing, the Œ everything had been packed  
already anyway, to get our lu gg
age and everything, to leave 
Germany
. And the ne 
Œ the very  first train out that was Œ head for 
Holland, 
we were on. 
Q: And this was when, exactly? 

A: The Œ about well Œ here, the pa
ssports. This is my mother™s.

67
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: So, let™s back Œ back  
up to Novemb er of 1938. 
A: Right. 
Q: What happened th en ? 
A: It Œ well, they Œ they  had plundered 
the synagogue then, everything th ere that 
night. 

Q: What do Œ wh at do you remember? 
A: What do I Œ well, I remember, ca
use I saw the synagogue afterwards Œ 
Q: Okay . 
A: Œ wh at they had done to 
it. They had plundered all that. In the morning Œ well, in 
the middle of the night that night, they came and tried to br
eak into our house. 
Being small, I never heard a thing. I slep
t through the whole th
ing. In the mo rning 
when  I woke up, I heard the doorbell ringing 
downstairs. They weren™t able to break 
into the house, the door was 
too strong. The police were th
ere to arrest my  dad, and 
took him to the jailhouse in 
Straubing
, and after a couple of days he was shipped 
off to 
Da cha u .
 
Q: And tell me about your mo th er, what happened with  your mo th er?  
A: Well, I wa Œ 
Q: How was her demeanor, was she frantic? 

 
Interview with Fred
 Firnbacher   
September 16, 2010 
 

 
 
68
A: Well, of course she was frantic, and she 
didn™t know what to 
do. She went to the 
police station, and she found a very symp at
hetic policeman there, and she was able 
to give him warm clothe Œ 
underclothing and stuff, so th
at he could stay warm, it 
was wintertime. And she went up there ev
ery day, she brought something for him 
every day, this is on Œ 
on Œ and on the third day Œ 
Q: Until he was shipped out. 

A: Œ on the third day he says, they™re gone
, he says. They asked where to, he says 
he wasn™t sure, but he thinks it™s 
Dach au. 
Q: And at this point he™s sendi
ng letters, por Œ postcards, or Œ 
A: No, it was a little bit different. He
 wou Œ he knew we™re
 allowed to send 
postcards after e-every so often. And th is is
 the thing th at he sent. Now th e Œ wh at I 
reme Œ would Œ thought woul
d be an ironic thing is Œ 
Q: Oh, he™s a World War I veteran. 

A: He™s a world Œ World War 
I veteran. He had the Iron Cr
oss. This is the Bavarian, 
some sort of cross there fr Œ 
Bavarian. And in here are Œ 
Q: Oh my God. 

A: This is the fifth Bavarian, some kind 
of division, I guess, in the name of His 
Majesty, the German Kaiser, that my fath
er got the Iron Cross, sec o nd class, 

 
Interview with Fred
 Firnbacher

whatever that means, and so  
on. That™s Œ that™s the authen
tic papers that he got the 
Iron Cross. 
Q: And so he got this in 
1917; one of these in 1917. 
A: Probably . Bu t you 
know, the Iron Cross Œ 
Q: Right. 

A: Œ that was 19 seven Œ that™s this one. 

Q: And one of them he got in 1934, right? 
A: Yeah. And this right here is His Majest
y the King, that would be the Kaiser Œ no, 
it™s 17 Œ Novemb er 1916
th
 Œ 
Q: 16. 

A: I Œ this is a German  script, which I ca
n™t read any more. That he got the Œ the 
military 
fatinzkreuzter(ph). 
Some kind of a cross, that
™s the third class with 
honors, or whatever. And that™s for th
e other one, and then he can Œ received 
another award, which I don™t know
 anything about, and I don™t Œ 
Q: In 1934 they wa Œ acr
oss the board, it Œ under 
Hitler, 
issued th-the Black Cross, 
this Black Cross. So he must 
have gotten this one in 19 si Œ 
A: No, he got th
is one 1916 Œ 
Q: Because Œ 
A: Œ and then this one 1917.

70
Q: Œ cause this is Œ 
A: That™s something else, I don™t know wh
at that™s for, but I just found th at. 
Q: Okay, because this is Œ 
this usually comes with this
. Usually it was awarded in 
1934 with that. 

A: That I don™t know. Anyw
ay  Œ cause it™s right Œ 
Q: So, is it Œ it™s ironic Œ 

A: Œ it says right there. Yeah. And that™s 
why it™s ironic, that™s why I said this will 
make a nice exhibit, for he fought for this
 country , and this is his thanks that he 
received. 

Q: And do you think he
 would have been treated differe
ntly if he hadn™t fought at 
all? 

A: I don™t think so. Wh at happened was, 
they had Œ my  mo ther heard somebody had 
gone to the Gestapo an
d asked Œ this can go with that also Œ 

Q: Okay . 
A: They had Œ they  had aske
d if their husband could be
 released. And because she 
had nerve en ough to  go to the Gestapo, th
ey released them. So
 my  mo th er said , 
well, I™m going to go to  the Gest
apo, too. She took th e train to 
Regensburg
, went to 
the Gestapo, and a couple days later, my  da
d walks in th e door. And he said that 
when he left 
Dachau,
 cause he had Œ always had mone
y with him, he Œ a lot of the

others who didn™t have money co uldn™t buy 
things, he left money, almo st all the 
money he had, he just kept enough so he
 co uld get home, he gave it to different 
people, and he got letters later on thanking 
him for it. And as it turned out, a week 
after he came home, they wo
uld have released him anyway
 cause they released all 
war veterans the following week. 

Q: Mm-hm. So at this point, what happens? 

A: This has to do with the Œ th
-the Œ with the medals, also. 
Q: Okay. Oh right, 
Ehrenkreuz. 
So he was released and th
en you Œ this is when 
you got newspapers togeth er Œ 

A: Well, we couldn™t g Œ we
 couldn™t go anywhere til we 
could go to the consulate 
in 
Stuttgart. 
 
Q: Right. 

A: He came home the first week in De
cember Œ second Œ first, second week, 
whatever, and our appointmen
t wasn™t with the consulate until January, January 
sixth. 

Q: Mm-hm. 

A: So we just had to sit 
around and wait and they would 
come pick up his passport, 
give it back to him. Have to go and pay 
a fine to get it back and wh at have you.

It was in February and we went off the 
ship. We landed in 
Hob o ken, 
went off the ship, through
 customs and one of my  
father™s nephews, my first cousin was ther

other cousin on my  
mother™s side was there. A

called the trains coming from 
New Jersey
 into 
New York
, and showed me, I 
remember, the tallest b u ild

Empire
 States building. They took 
us to lunch, and I don™t remember where or what, and they put 
us on the train for 
Washin gton, 
somebody else was suppos
ed to meet us here to pick us up. They 
didn™t show up for some reason or other, 
and we took a cab, because the people who 
sponsored us, who we were going to stay w
ith, they were in th
eir 70s already then. 
So they  didn™t come out at night, and so
 th is Œ I Œ he Œ missed connections or

parents seek out other German Jews?
