Q
. I f you c o uld jus t begi n by telli ng me  your  
na me , where  you were  bor n, whe n you wer e bor n. 
A
. My na me  is Eri ka Ki nel.  I wa s 
born a Reiss   [she spells it]   in Zagreb, Yugolavia, July 1st, 
1926.   
Q
. Tell me a little bit about what
 you remember 
about growing up 
in Zagreb, your fa mily --  
A
. I wa s an onl y chil d.  I  had a s e t 
of grandparents, my mo
t her 's pare nts .  M y mother, my father and 
I lived in the sa me  house.  My father wa s a mercha
nt, my  grandfather wa s also
 a merchant: textiles.  
My grandfat her had t he s t ore i n the  hous e, i n the bui
lding.  My father 's st ore 
was i n the  city but not 
far fr om home.  We had a very ni
ce apart ment .  We also had a mai d
 and a cook and  (laughing)  a 
laundre ss.  So we were  pr
etty well-t o- do.  I we nt t o a He bre w pr
ivat e sc hool for four
 years, I think it 
was fo ur years, yes.  A
nd then I went to the gy mn
asium, the public
 school, till I was about sixteen. 
And that's when the trouble starte
d.  And I still went for about half
 a year to Catholic school for 
domestic whatever t hey we
r e goi ng t o teac h us but I was n 't there long be c ause we had to leave our  
house at a certain ti me and I  co
uldn't go t o s chool  a ny more , t ha t was  the  e nd of my educa tion. 
Q
. I just wa nt to get s o me  of t he Je wi s h communit
y in Zagre b and whether you we re int egrate d with  
Cat holi cs, or  whet her  you went  
to the gymnasium with that --  
A
. That was public sc hool, jah.  Th
e first four year s was pr ivat e sch
ool , the  rest was public sc hool . 
It was  a publ ic hi gh sc hool
 a nd I gra d uate d fr om t hat. 

Q
. Wa s your  fa mil y rel i gi ous?  
A
. We were conservative, ------.  We
 went t o synagogue every Fri day and Sat u
rday.  We  observed 
all the holi da ys but  it  was n 't  the  wa y t h
e Orthodox because th
er e weren't  any.   
Q
. Di d you have Cat holi c frie nds?  
A
. Yes  I  di d.  Ye s. 
Q
. Did you sense any anti-se
mitism before the War?

Q
. I n my Ger man teacher.  She re
sented the fact  that  I spoke Ger m
an before she ever  did, and I  
spoke Ger man and she always corr
ec ted me .  I sa id, " La dy, I  kne w 
first before you di d" a nd t hat  
rubbed her t he wrong way, beca use  she lear ne d it 
in school, it wasn't he
r mother tongue; my 
Ger ma n was  my mot her ton gue .  An d wit h the Yu
goslav teacher s, they 
didn't like me too much 
either because they were my mot h
er 's teachers, so I preferred the 
ideas t h ey were my teachers and 
her t eachers at the same
 ti me  a n d  the y  re me mbe r ed my  mo th
er a nd t he y re me mb
ered me.  But  I  
don't know, it was j ust t he feeli ng t hat the y di dn'
t like me; I don't know 
for what reason.  The 
German teacher I know
 for sur e she didn't care 
one wa y or the  other .  If
 I said one way, she wo uld 
pronounc e it  the other way and she j ust got al wa ys
 my case because I t h e 
Fre nch t ea cher a nd t he 
Hebrew teacher and lots 
of teachers different nationalities -- not 
nationalities, really, 
different point s  
of vie w t he y  ha d a bout different  th
ings.  But there wasn't  
anything that you had 
to fear or that you  
had to be upset about .  Maybe --------- to realize, 
I don't thi n k there was any anti-se mitism at that  
time . 
Q
. You di dn't know it c ould c o me  out agai . 
A
. No. 
Q
. In the Jewish community in 
Zagreb were there political orga
nizations, youth 
organizations, 
Zionist? 

Q
. Ye s.  I be longed t o M aka be (ph) gymna stics for 
as long as I  can rememb
er, from t he day I coul d 
walk till the day we left.  Gy
mnati cs.  I took 
fe ncing and gymnastic
s.  I enjoyed it. 
Q
. We re your par ent s i nvolve d
 in any of thee things? 
A
. Not  rea l l y, no.  The y wer e bus y with t he busine
ss and Mot her was busy ra
ising me, so there was 
not  so much involve me nt .   I n t h
e syna gogue;  that 's about it .   
Q
. So you mentione d t hat  thi ngs  st arte d t o 
c ha nge .  What happe ned
, and when, a bout?   
A
. You me a n about whe n the War c a me to t he city
?  Well, we were thro
wn out of our house  
Thurs day be fore the Good Frida y 
1941.  The Ger mans came
 in and they told 
us to leave wit hin 
hours with j ust our clot hes ------ and that was the last
 we'd seen of our house,
 of our possessions of 
anyt hing els e.  So that was it.  And fr om t hat da y 
on we starte d to go int o hidi ng.  So we hi d in th e

city fr om April through the fo llowi
ng Januar y.  We hid wi th fri ends bu
t we had t o be on the lookou t  
-- ever y ti me some body rang the 
doorbell  you had to go hi de 
bec aus e we didn't know who wa s  
coming to get us. But the Germans 
t hat t ook ove r  our  hous e use d it 
for a prison.  That  was t he mai n  
object to do.  A prison, an
d my grandfather had a fi ne
 cellar and they used that
 to kill people; to loc k  
them up and eventually kill 
them.  I don't remember 
any other soldiers going, 
they were in the city 
but t he y j ust  ha d to pic k on t he 
house .  It was conveni entl y l oc a
ted and the y figu
re d big enough t o  
provide t he m and the r e wer e about four st ories high
.  Ther e wer e  four te nant s on ea c h fl oor .  The r e  
was a fact or y on t he mai n 
floor and t here was a st ore 
on the  gr ound fl oo
r.  So they needed t he place, 
they took it, they didn't 
ask.  So t hat  was the be
ginni ng of the en
d and so the y starte d cha sing us  
around.  You couldn't  go out i n the 
st reets because you were
 afraid that some bo
dy mi ght catc h you. 
They tried t o catch my fat her 
several times to take him awa
y.  S o meti me s th ey t o ok hi m and 
retained hi m for a few hour and th
e y r e lease d hi m agai n.  Just pl
ain hara ssi ng.  We nt on for mont hs  
and months in this time.  Finally
 we  ha d some  friends i n Lublya na
, t hey hel pe d us t o get out  o f  
Zagreb. 
Q
. Be fore  you le ft  Zagreb, who 
was the fa mil y you were  hi di
ng at perhaps,
 in Zagreb?  
A
. The y wer e c ousi n
s of my mother's . 
Q
. So they wer e al so Je wis h. 
A
. Oh yes.  I still can'
t fi gure out why they weren'
t after them.  They
 just happened to 
be after us or 
whatever possessed t hem t o do it 
but they hid with some relatives. 
 I guess t he y were hi ding too, 
more or les s, you know --  you were sneaki ng around at  night to go out if you want ed to go.  If not ,  

you j ust sta y ed i n and hope
d for the best that nobody wa
s going to catch up wi th you. 
Q
. What  about you?   Did you 
st ay in most of the  t i me?  
A
. Yeah. 
Q
. What wa s goi ng on in the street s?  
 I mean, wer e  there suddenly a lo
t of restrictions on the Jewi sh 
people?  

A
. Yes.  We  had to wear 
a star.  Wa nt to see it? 
Q
. You ha ve  it?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0309  
4 
 
A
. Yes. 
Q.
 Afte r t his .  What othe r  ki nds  of re st rictions?  
A
. Well , j ah, we di dn't go out  muc h
, s o we didn't  r un i nto too much 
pr obl e ms .  But i f you did go out 
and di dn't wear a st ar and t hey
 ca ught up wit h you, the n you 
mi ght  ha ve  been in troubl e. 
Q
. Wa s t here ----- presen
ce i n t he streets? 
A
. I really don't rememb er
.  I mean, from that day 
on my mi nd just got kind of bla nk because I sa w 
the soldiers when they 
c a me to get t he house and we shoul d ge
t out, but then af
terwards I can't 
re me mber what ha ppe ne d wit h t he s o
ldier s and I  hung ar ound i n t he 
house, more or 
less, not to be 
seen or heard of.  My father ha
d a German passport, so maybe it gave him a little bit of protection. 
From the year that we came to 
Yugoslavia till we left, he was alwa
ys a persona non grata for some  
reason or another , because t hey on
ly gave him six months 
of staying ti me and th
en he  had to go t o  
the police and sign up again si x mor e
 mont hs, and that we nt on fr om 
1922 to 1942; fo
r 20 years.  He 
never became a citizen and he had 
to go every six m
onths and tell them why he
's still there.  But 
then he got a German passport and 
that somehow helped us
.  I was little but we we
re stateless at that  
poi nt. 
Q
. The people who kicked 
you out of your house we
re Croatians, military. 
A
. No , Germans. 
Q
. And pri or  to that  you didn
't feel any retrict ions i n J e wish, bet wee n '40 and 41. 
A
. No. 
Q
. Do you r e me mbe r  your fa mily 
talking about what their plans we
re , what  you wer e goi ng to do?  
A
. Oh yes , we had pl ans and t hey wer e  fi r m pl an
s, too.  We we re going 
to South America, to 
Ur uguay, M onte video.  We  ha d pa
ss ports  and pa pers , e veryt hing ma de
 out in 1939.  
 An d we we r e  
goi ng to M o tevideo a nd my pare nts wer e  goi ng t o st
art like a catering business
.  But t hen when the 
visas  ca me  up, my mot h er and I we
 coul d tra vel , my fat her  wa s no
t allowed to leav
e  the countr y. 
So we sta ye d be hind a n d we didn't go.  We ha
d everyt hing pac ked.  I  re
me mb er th e suit cas e s,  
ever ythi ng was pac ked for Sout h 
Ame r ica.  Ne ver  got  ther e.   
Q
. Why were you going to 
go to Sout h Ameri ca?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0309

A
. I don't know.  My father one da
y decided he was 
going  [tape glitch, loss 
of a phrase]  for some 
reason or ot her said " Let 's l ook at t h e map" an
d he put his fi nger on it a n d he sa ys, " Mont evi deo, 
Ur uga y," a n d that 's whe r e we were 
going to go.  Ha d the papers rea dy a n d the s uitca s es pac ke d and 
the clot hes for South America and 
e v erythi ng.  And we re ma i ned th
ere because my mother  said she 
wa sn't goi ng to leave hi m 
behi nd.  So s he le ft hi m be hind -- he
 le ft us  behi nd whe n he ca me t o  
Ameri ca!  ( she l aughs )   He just wa nte d to go
 away, I guess.  Or  he
 had a feeling, he had 
pre moniti on beca use he had rela tive s i n Vi enna a n d 
they were already being 
chased around, so they  
came t o America or  they had 
to go some where  el s e.  So th
at  was 1939 but i t ha ppene d. 
Q
. We re you a ware  of re fuge
es from Germany or Austria comi ng into Yugoslavia? 
A
. Yes .  I ha d a  cousi n who was i n Dacha u i n 1939
 a nd he  esc ape d Dac ha u  and c a me t o  Yugosla via  
and he  was  l i ving wit h my
 grandmother for about si
x mont hs or  so.  And he
 t ook hi s li fe .  And a 
mont h be for e  he was goi ng to go t o Ameri ca, he  ha
d a si ster  that wor ked 
in Mt. Sinai Hospital in 
New York City and she se
nt papers for hi m and he was complete
ly devastated.  I still don't know 
how he managed to get out 
of it but he did, but he 
was completely  [she tra
ils off]  I had that uncle  
that was i n t he ar my and 
he ra n way from the ar my too.  He ca me
 back but they went
 to Italy before 
us s o didn't see hi m a gai n for  many years .  Was my
 mot her 's  brot her . But 
the cousin, that r eall y  
shook me  up, because he wa s only,
 like, fi ftee n or s i xtee n.  
 
Q
. But you had i n for mati on 
on what wa s happe ni ng. 
A
. Oh yeah.  But I was never t old
 because I  was too yo
ung t o realize what 
but I  knew what was 
goi ng on.  They wouldn't  eve n t ell me 
that he kill ed hi msel f, t hey hush
ed i t up, they were afraid i f 
they woul d catch us bec ause we wer e har bori ng a 
fugiti ve fr om Dachau, th
e they would probabl y  
have give us  the he ave- ho muc h sooner.  This wa s 
in 1939.  My gr andfat her 
was still alive at that 
time . 

Q
. This peri od i n Zagr eb when you 
wer e hi ding:  wer e you a ble to ge
t what you needed
  -- food or 
anyt hing els e?  

Q
.  I think the fo od at th
at point was already rati
oned.  I remember
, like, getting one roll a day or 
somet hing, you know.  
It  wa s war alr e ad y.  Hal f  o f the  worl d  
wa s alre ady four year s i n war, so it

wa sn't ea sy t o get anythi
ng but we j u st didn't ha ve that muc h lib
ert y to go out a nd get  it.  So just  
some how survive d. 
Q
. Do you r e me mbe r  your parent s ta lking a bout at 
that point where you were
 going t o go next  and 
what you would do?  

A
. We  ha d s o me fri ends in Lublya na that had le ft Zagr
eb be for e us  and t he y were  tryi ng to get  us t o  
cros s into Lubl yana but at that poi nt it was under Ita
lian, so fi nally in January
 of '42 we left Zagr eb 
for Lubl ya na .  That was a  trip I ne ver forge t .  We 
had t o cr oss the border a
nd it was so cold and w e  
we nt in a n oxc art.  Gra ndma i n
side the cart and my fa
ther and I a nd my mo
ther on top and we  
al most fr oze to deat h.  My knees fr oze, my fat h
er 's ears fr oze, it was ho
rrible.  But there were 
soldiers on us, it was like the fr
ont already.  There were sol diers 
t here a nd we di dn't  know i f we  
weren't going to get killed.  We 
had no idea what we we
re getting into.  We 
crossed the river one  
night and I r e me mbe r  the  onl y thi
ng I took with me from 
home  wa s pi cture s , fa
mil y pic t ues , a nd I  
dragge d t hos e  (l aughi ng)   for 40 
years now.   But that was the on
ly thi ng I  figure d I  could ne ver  
replace.  I could re
place everything else but this
 I couldn't and I dragged th
at with me over hill and  
dale , over a river , acr oss  the border on a n oxcart , 
and final l y we ma de it  
into a ca mp some pl ace  
overnight.  And fi nlly we got into
 Lublyana.  Friends were waiting 
for us and we fo und a place t o  
live.  We stayed there from Janu
ary '42 till '43.  But there again th
e problem started that they were  
picki ng up people .  Every ti me s o
me body ventured out i n to the st
r eet  they pi cke d you up a d  
detai ned you for a day, for an ho
ur, for good, then they 
let you go.  M ostly me n, beca us e they were  

looking for r ecruit s, for s o mebody 
t he y di dn't l ook who the  guy was ,
 a s long a he c oul d wal k.  My 
fat her he got  caught a coupl
e of times.  We told hi
m not to go but he had to
 go.  Any ti me  he felt  
like going out for a s moke he went out, and he go
t caught .  So he was qui t e tough but he made t he 
best  of it, a n d we  just wa ited be fore  
we c oul d go a ny furt her  down the count ry. 
Q
. What  happened when 
your fa ther  got c aught?  
A
. They questioned him 
for a day and then th
ey let  hi m go.   
Q
. We re they the It
alian authorities? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0309

A
.  Yes .  Ital ian Ger ma ns .
  I really don't know. 
 They pic ke d hi m up and 
they loaded hi m on a bus  
and took hi m s o me pla c e for hours a t  a ti me a nd th
en t hey br ought hi m back
.  And I told hi m ma ny 
ti me s, " Don't stic k your  nos
e out."   (laughing)   
But  the y ne ver le arn;  ne ver le arn, be caus e they 
always  got c aught one way or t he ot
her.  He got  c aught 
once, they were bombing
 a house in the city 
and he ha d t o go bac k for a pac k of c i garett es a nd 
a bomb fell near t he house.
  So he le arne d,  (s he  
laughs)   but it took hi m a fe w year s.
  He li ke s t h e se verit y of th
e  whole t hing, to 
him it just wa s 
somet hing t h at does n't ha ppe n. 
Q
. What  was  your  dail y li
fe  like in Lubljana?   
How did t hings retur n?  
A
. We ll, t he r e wer e nice  parks , go for a wa lk, go
 out with a friend and that was about it.  There  
wa sn't much to do.  Ther
e  was n 't  anything to do. 
Q
. But you c oul d do pret t y
 much what  you want ed? 
A
.  Yes .  I wa s always wat chi ng our back s o me body 
was n 't  aft er us , or - -  actuall y there wa sn't a 
war , there was a firi ng li ne goin
g on;  it was j ust, you know, it  wa s 
state of wa r.  But that didn't 
bot her us, re ally, as far a s -- onc e the y got it over
 wit h, pic king hi m up e v ery othe r da y, t here  was  

somet hing li ke t hat , t hen it st opped.
  An d in '43 we left; 
we got  ther e i n '42 and 
we left in '4 3.   
Q
. Now, you live d i n the  ope n t here ,
 you were n't  in hi ding re all y. 
A
. We ll, hi di ng:  we didn't  know where  to hi de fro
m or  who.  So we  were  wat ching our sel ves . 
Q
. We re ther e a  lot  of ot her Je wi sh 
pe ople  in your  predi ca me nt there?  
A
. I really don't know.  Th
ey were themselves in a predicament,
 they were under 
Italian rule and 
here  was Jugosla v c ountr y 
was Slovenia and they we
re under Slovenia
ns but then the Italians came 
in and t his wa s ours .  They eve n wa nted to give  
us a n Itali an prince t o rule over t he c ountry when  
they came i n to Jugosl avia --a
nyt hing,  (laughing)   j ust
 to get away with it.   
Q
. And pe ople were  fair l y re sent ful  of the  Itali ans ? 
Q
. Well , I t hink they
 felt better under the Ita
lia ns t han the y  did under t he Ger ma ns  beca us e the  
Italians were in the wa
r too with them, so -- 

Q
. What  ha ppened ne xt?  
A
. We  left  and we went 
down south and we wou
nd up in Mo
nbacelli (ph).

Q
. Why di d you go ther e ? 
A
. Be cause we hoped t h at we woul d 
be liber ated sooner than if we 
stayed ther e.  We just couldn't  
stay, you know, too long in any pl
ace, so we went to 
Monbacelli, and there we
 were ma de civilian 
internees of war.   
Q
. How did you get th
ere?  Tell me a l
ittle bit more about 
the whole process. 
A
. We tr ave l led -- you know, we dec i

there and t hey caught us 
and we were under t he the ----- and t hey 
put us in the hous

 had to call every week to sign 
up, we weren't allowed to leave  
town, a nd i n  order not t o  stand out  
we went to church ev

was not much to eat ,  
they had a few chickens, a few gees

coul d eat s o met hing but  we lived 
mainly on bea ns; eggs a n d bea ns -- bean sal ad, bean s prea d, 
anyt hing bea ns; not eve n pasta , j ust beans .  And 
we lived there with
 the farmers, w
ith the peasants 
there, with not much to 
do, you know.  I learned 
how to spend a little time 
and somebody 
taught me 
how to s e w.  Ther e wa s not much 
to do, we j ust we nt from day to
 day a n d you ate what you c oul d

they kne w where we were
 fr om.  The authorities 
knew, I don't know if the people knew but the auth
orities knew.  We had to

couple weeks, we had t o go i n an
d re gister , a nd i f  we wa nte d t o

Q

it was very nice l ocated 
and ------- nice
 and warm, 
but the r e wa s no hea t  in the house or  anythi ng,you know, but at least the r e was a pl a ce hal f wa y 

dece nt t o l i ve in.  But  no
 food, there wa s no fo od. 
Q
. We re you aware of other re
fugees i n t hat area al so? 
A
. Yes, they had quite a 
few people t here in t he same town. 
 The same ----- with t he government  
and e veryt hi ng but we  be ca me good friends, there was not hi
ng else to do. 
Q

Near Fl orence, that 's far, and I thi

Q

A

Q
. It  must ha ve bee n
 something for her. 
A
. Yes.  But she survive

 ma ke it to America. 
Q
. Do you s ort of re me mber your 
fr ame of mind at the ti me and wh
at you wer e thinking?   Was it  
nerve wrac ki ng, wa s it  advent urous , was it  --  
A
. When I l ook ba ck on it no
w, it wa s nervewracking bu
t at that point probably
 it re all y di dn't faz e  
me , I wa s  (laughing)  too  young to think about
, you know.  It was i mperative that we s urvi ve , 
beca use  e ver y day was  a  ne w stor y, a ne w
 
beginning, you know.
   
Q
. Do you r e me mbe r  your pare nt
s talking about the situation?  
A
. Well, i t was hard to get throu
gh t he war, you know, a
nd we ----- as far as 
we could.  And the n  
they let us out in '46 a
nd we  tra vele d agai n further  down a nd we
nt to Empoli (ph)
 and at Empoli we  
wer e hi ding agai n.  Ther e we st ayed on a far m, i n
 a barn, we slept i n a 
bar n, and we cooke d where  
the used to be like a pi gst y, t he 
ani mal s were eating just wher e our 
kitchen wa s.  Tha t  was wher e --  
then the bombs started fl ying ar
ound and it  was  bad.  Bombs we
re comi ng down, Ameri c a ns we re  
bombing t he  city, and 
we  got  ca ught a gain in th
e bombs .  We  we nt down i n
side t he countr ysi de and 
they were shelling on either
 side of the hills.  My father almo st 
got caught with a sh
ell.  (laughing)  
And we never ha d anything t o eat -- 
we took walnuts off the trees at night, and in the morning the 
far mer c a me  out and sai d , 
"Show me your ha nds" a
nd whe n ha nds were bla ck, t he y kne w we stol e  
wal nut s from t he tree s a nd we had 
to eat that.  We went into the fi eld and we took some tomatoes 
and some pe pper s, whate ver we c oul d lay our hand
s on.  And Gra ndma  wa s 
pla ying de af and mute  
and the rest  of the time  she wa
sn't allowed to speak.  But th
en again the Ger mans wer e down 
already and they were trying to 
catch my father agai
n and he was sitting on 
a bench and one day a 
Ger ma n pas s ed by a nd he  said, in Ger ma n, " We 're goi
ng t o ta ke  this guy."  An
d my  father took off -
- my father  s poke Ger ma n, and the 
----- were It alian, so my
 father took off, "T
hat 's it , I 'm not  going 
to si t ar ound and wai t  fo
r  hi m to pic k me  up agai
n."  Every da y it wa s --  a n
d then the soldiers were  
already up and there wer e mi nes in the fiel ds ever
y morni ng we we got out of
 the ba rn t o go out and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0309

get s o me fre sh air , we had to wat ch the gr ound t o 
see for la nd mine s that  they had l e ft t he ni ght  
be for e.  So t hat wa s a l rea dy battl eg
r o und, t hat  wa s war alrea d y in full 
force.  They were co ming i n -
- that 's what we actual ly wanted
 to ge t there but not bei ng i n between.  Eve ry da y the y bombed, one  
day the y fle w a  missi on over  500 
pla nes we counted -- so low that
 you c o uld count t h e m and t hey  
kept droppi ng the bombs and t he y wer e al ways goi
ng further up.   They we
re going to Germany, but 
there wer e some Ameri c an bombs, 
not Ger mans, Ameri can, t hey we
re going to Germany.  In the 
meanti me once in a whi l e would drop -- we ne
ve r kne w who was dr oppi ng the bomb s, we never  
kne w who was a bove , we  just
 had to hide.  Wh en we  heard the si
re ns go off the n we  ha d to r un and 
hide .  Whe n  the sire ns didn't go bac k -- a f ter t h e 
alert , t hen it just  stayed
 like this forever, never 
stopped till the end of the wa
r.  Always on alert.  And there was one
 place we slept, the four of us in 
one  bed -- t wo of us t his  way and two 
across, like sardines
 i n a  pot.   
Q
. Who wer e these  far m ers who wer e s helteri ng you?  
A
. Italians, Ita
lian farmers. 
Q
. Di d t hey know who you were?  
A
. I i ma gine  they would.  Well , the y gave us their  
barn to sl ee p in, wit h th
e straw.  I think it was 
warm; never snowed. 

Q
. And agai n, were  you Cat holi cs now?  
A
. Nothing.  There wa s nothing.
  
I remember one thing t hat was so 
funny.  It was Easte r , Christ ma s  
-- one of t he holi days -- and the y were  cooki ng a nd 
cleani ng and doi ng their  chore s or whate ver, a n d  
we sa id, " Where I ca me fr om, J ugosl avia , Christ
ma s was a big holi da y, East er was a  big holi da y, 
nobody wor ked."  And I  said
 to t hem, " The closer you are t o  th
e Pope , the less  re
ligious you are." 
And they were jus t  laughing. " O h we work e ver y 
da y."  Of cour se, i n Jugosla via we kept t he  
holi days, whatever a person beli eved 
in we kept it.  But in Italy they
 didn't seem to care wh ether it 
wa s Christ masda y or Ea ster Su
nday; whatever, they worked. 

Q
. And you staye d i n this  ne w pl ace  --  
A

A
. Till 1944; another y
ear with a second ye
ar in betw
een each. 
Q
. You stayed mostl y i n th
e same ------- we
re you on the run a b
it more than t hat? 
A
. We ll, at that time the soldiers 
wer e coming up and the y tried to hel p us  to get wher e we want ed 
to go.  To help us out th
ere were soldiers from Indi
a that  came and liberated that  part  of t he countr y 
and they helped us out a 
little bit, and then they 
went further down south 
and then we wound up in  
Ro me .  In R o me we wer e  in a ca mp
 t hat us ed t o be old st udi o of Ci
neci ta Roma and we wer e locked 
up t here unt il the y de cided what to
 do wit h us.  They had a  fe w 
pe opl e  there but  not too ma ny . 
The n t he y de cide d what t o do wi th us , 
so they se nt us t o
 the camp in Bari . 
Q
. Whe n you we nt t o Ba
ri it was all refugees? 
A
. Ja, it wa s a refugee camp. 
Q
. Who wer e s o me of these pe ople  i n
 Bari?  How big 
a place was it? 
A
. That was a letdown, t h e 
camp, 1500 people or somethi ng.  In
 the beinning it was a -------- transit  
camp, so people came there, they st
ayed there fo r a fe w weeks or mont
hs till they were repatriated. 
There were Chinese, there were 20
 different nati ons, and whoever wa
s abl e  to be se nt bac k, a nd t h e  
one s t hat ha d no place  to go, st ay
ed.  So we stayed fi ve years. 
Q
. What  month di d yo
u a rrive , i n 1944?  
A
. October 9, 1944. 
Q
. Were ther e a lot  
of Jews there? 
A
. Yes.  There were Chinese, Japa
nese, Turks, Gr eeks -- a lot of Gr
ee ks -- all ki nds of people from 
all over. 

Q
. What  was  it li ke?   What di d i t  l ook like?  
A
. Some of t he m were ba rracks.  
Ther e wer e 12 barracks and there 
were some big room with walls  
bet wee n a nd ever ythi ng else was ope n, c ots a r ound 
[? ], eve r yt hing was open, t here wa s just a wall  
here and the n there wer e  12 be ds 
her e and 12 be ds t here  and all th
e wa y around.  An
d then at the 
end was a lavator y at the end.  
And t here was no privac y at a ll. 
 So t he Chinese were playi ng al l 
mi ght a nd they were ga mbling all 
ni ght a nd you coul dn't sle e p.  A
nd t hen they were a r gui ng, and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0309  
13 
 
then t hey we re fi ghti ng, a nd thi s went  on and on 
a nd on.  You coul dn't sl
e e p.  And not hing to do. 
At least  t hey fe
d us, but there wa
s nothing to do. 
Q
. Your fa mily all 
stayed in the sa me barracks?  
A
. Yeah, my father and my  mo ther; my  grandmothe
r ha d le ft  at t he  ti me, she  found her s on the re  
and she went wit h hi
m ti ll she passed away a year
 later.  She neve
r left the camp.  
My uncle stayed  
in t he city, li ved in the ci t y, he  never  l eft  th
e camp either .  So we 
three wound up in camp . 
Q
. Thr ee da ys be fore  she  ha d go
ne  to the ca mp, di dn't t hey?  
A
. Yes , ha d no choice .  Either go
 ba ck ho me  or stay in the cam
p and hope for t he  be st.  And t h e  
Wa r didn't fi nish up unt il  `45.  We we nt there in 
'44, so there was still six mont hs of war .  The War  
fi nis hed in April 1945.   
Q
. What  di d you do all da y?  
A
. In t he be ginning, not hing.  Tr yi
ng to get a better, some othe
r  bar r ac ks, like  a r oom, fa mily  
quart ers or somethi ng, you know 
-- t wo wooden cots, tw
o boards, and a piece of ------- , whatever , to 
put under, li ke a hor se, you know, 
wi th a piece of wood over t he hor se
, that 's how we slept.  Fi ve 
years .  And we got fe d.  The r e wa
s a big r oom where you'd get  your 
me als and when you got i n they  
put us in showers.  Do this ------
-  whatever they were afrai d we
 mmight bri ng -- t hen we were 
body-s earc h ed.  And t h en we  were
 assigne d t o our barr acks  and 
we stayed ther e.
  And ove r the 
years we improved a little bit -- we had our room,  
and we could do our own 
cooking if we wanted 
to.  Bu t the room wa
sn't  bigger than 
somebody's bathroom. 
Q
. Well, fil l  your stor y be fore th
e War  ende d.  Wer e  you allowe d out
 of the c a mp, c oul d you go int o  
town --
 
A
. Wit h a pass.  You ne ede d a pas s to get out. 
 And the r e was no bus , s o you hitc h- hike d wi th 
soldi ers int o town.  In the beginning it  was hard
, because ther e was still wa r  and you know we were 

afraid to go, but later on 
t here were buses t hat  took us down int o
 town.  I f you wante d t o  shop or  a  
movie or whatever, it 
made it easy but in the begi
nning it was very hard.  An
d until they got rid of a 
lot of ot her  peopl e -- and people ke pt always  co
mi ng and going, you know, 
you ne ver  had the  sa me 
a mount of peopl e at any give n ti me, t hey were c o
mi ng a nd going.  And eventu
ally we got a job in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0309  
14 
 
the office, my fat her, my 
mother  and I  got a job i n 
the office.  My fat her wa
s the pa yr ol l clerk, my  
mother  first  she worked i n the show
er  room, t hen she got a job i n th
e office, and I was an interprete r 
for the commandant  wh o wa s there. 
Q
. Wa s t he camp under t he control  of -------? 
A
. No , the United Nations Relief Or ganization. 
Q
. I n 1944?  
A
. Yes.   
Q
. If it was a liberated area. 
A
. Yeah.  
Q
. So your  c o mmanda nt
 wa s fr o m t h e  U. N.  
A
. Yeah, well, most of them were 
British.  They were all soldiers 
that were fed up, so you know  
they got into camp. 

Q
. Wa s i t organi zed -------? 
A
. Oh, you become used
 to, to get the hang of it.  Until they
 were more settled and we didn't get s o  
ma ny people  in and out , s o the one s that stayed e ve ntu
all y stayed for five years, si x years.  The first  
three year s wer e har d because we
re all comi ng and goi ng i n  droves
.  They had brought t hem in  
busloads and took them
 out by busloads.  If they
 didn't kill each other during
 the night or something,  
then the y t o ok t he m out  (laughi ng) 
 wit h an ambulances or somethi ng.
   So, it was qu
ite a stor y.  I  
wrote a little nov
el about it.  I have it. 
Q
. We re there a lot of restrictio
ns on what you could 
do or not do while 
the Wa r was still on?  
A
. - ---------- -------------- - ---.  I f you r eally wa nte d  to go i nto t own they let  you i n on t he pa ss, you 
had to be  ba ck a t  a  cert ai n ti me , but  t here  was not h
ing el se you c oul d do i n 
town either.  Not much 
you could do.  And the n  everybo
dy hoped a nd praye d the War woul
d end soon.  We
 wr ote a lette r  
to the Presi d ent, t here was a big 
to-do in the camp and 
the sol di ers and ever ybody, the r e  was quite a  
ceremony.  But that didn'
t mea n t hat  -- wa nting t he e nd of one, t he other one  start ed.  Beca use  we  
didn't re alize  how long it  was goi ng t o take us to get 
out of there.  People st
ayed after I left in '49 
there , until  '50.  
I think in '50 it 
was  closed up.

Q
. We re you abl e t o observe ----- your
 religion at  al l?  Or

know we wer e tryi ng 
but  ther e wa s not muc h y
ou could do.  Not much. 
Q
. Wa s t her e a ny se nse  of c o mmunit y i n t his  ca mp?  
A
. In wh ich sense? 
Q
. We ll, for example, the Jewish 
pe ople band t oget her i n --  
A
. Ye s, we wer e all wor king on our 
wa y out of it, so we were  all like a gr oup.  Lots of peopl e that  
worked in the office situation th
ey all had relatives in
 Ame r i ca and wer e  all 
tryi ng to get out . We  
started doing it in 1945.  It took 
years before we ever 
hear d anythi ng.  The co
nsulat e in Na ples w a s  
very for t hc omi ng with a nyt hing.  Vi sas or anythi ng for that  matt er, we j ust
 ha d t o si t around a nd  
wait  our t ur n .   
Q

A
. We ll, the y kept  us i n for med, bec a use  sol die

Q
. How di d you re act?  
A
. Well , ha ppy.  We di dn't know wh
at wa s waiti ng for us at t he ne
xt c orner.  We had no idea how 
long it's going to take us, what 
the situation was, who wa
s going to help us out getting out.  So we 
just ha ng in t here .  

Q
. Di d you feel li berat ed? 
A
. We ll, yes , and t hen a gain, ther e 's no pla ce to 
go.  How much li berat ed ca

place  to go?  

Q
. What  di d you do?   Wh
at were  your  plans?  
A
. Well , we appli ed for visas.  My
 fat her had brot hers i n Ame r ica 
a nd he a pplie d for vi sas a nd we  
wait ed.  For  '4 6, howe ver long it 
t o ok, how ma ny visa s wer e avail a
bl e.  The y wer e  onl y fis hing 
them out in little batches, 
ma ybe five or ten at a ti
me for certain count
ries.  I was sup
posed to go an d 
all of a sudden a guy 
come s up a nd s ays well , I 'll have to go with
 thi s guy, and it  was t wo vis as, so I  
coul dn't go a nd I had to wait .  
I wa s pus he d bac k , you know.  They 
had t o  pic k pre fer e nce quota s

and they had to pick pref
erence couples or fa milies,
 and I was on a a special 
visa, I couldn't go and I 
wa nte d to.  You s ee, I 
was consi dered Czech acco

age , I go a c cordi ng t o my father. 
 And my mot her went on the Yugos

too; and the Cze ch vi sas wer e scarc er , so many
 time when the  quota s ca me around a nd visas ca me  
up, I was too old to go on my fathe r 's
 quota,  s o I had to wait another 
year .  I t  took me  thr ee yea r s to  
get here  a ft er  my par ent s ca me.
 
Q
. Bui your pare nts  ca me  first .  
A
. Yes.  My father in 
'47, my  mo ther in '4
8, and I  c a me i n '49. 
Q
. Fa mili es didn't  come  over  toget he r. 
A
. No.  All depe nde d on t he quota .  
Q
. Because they had di
fferent nationalities. 
A
. Different nationalities
.  I was considered statel
ess, because actually in 
Europe you are what your

you're bor n i n Ameri ca, y

cigare ttes a n d some ca ndy.  If t hey weren't stol en

So, my father sat there

  That was the rule.  They went 
on a pass, if you wanted to go 
not e ver yday but you nee ded a pa ss
.  You we nt to town 
t hen you needed tr ans
