Q: Tell us your name  and where you were born. 
 
A: My name  is Ruth Borsos. I Œ my ma iden 
name  was Moser, and I was born in Frankfurt, 
Germany. 
 
Q: Andwhen?  
 
A: Oh, when Œ in 1923, the 15th of October.  
 
Q: Would you tell us a little of your family life? 
 
A: OK. Sure. I had a rather normal childhood. I 
grew up in a mi ddle-class family and my 
paternal grandparents lived very close to us 
and so did my maternal grandparents. And I 
went Œ started to go to school. It was a public
 school. Jewish children went there, like any 
other children of the neighborhood and in 1933 
it was the time that Hitler came to power. 
Things started to change radically. Nearly overn
ight, when we came  back to school we were 
segregated in a sense that suddenly all the 
children knew who are the Jews and who are not 
the Jews, because we were received with words 
of ﬁdirty Jew.ﬂ They started to throw rocks 
at us. We had to Œ every child had to learn 
to sing the Nazi hymn and Œ but soon thereafter 
we were forbidden Œ the Jewish children were 
forbidden to sing the Nazi hymn, so we were 
segregated and we felt it all the way from ev
ery morning that we came to school. It was 
towards the end of the elementary school years that my parents took me out of the school and 
entered me in a special Jewish school with 
many other children who left the public schools. 
And I passed a few years in the special Jewish
 school, then went on to the higher Jewish 
high school and stayed there until 1938, and in 1938 the pogroms against the Jews of 
Germany started. 
 
01:02:41 
 
Q: Could you describe those pogroms?  
 
A: Sure. The pogroms were only an excuse of
 what had happened. A young Jew in Paris was 
very aggravated because his parents had b
een sent to Poland and he took revenge by 
shooting a German diplomat. And, as you 
mi ght know, in November the 9th, 1938, the 
famous Kristallnacht
1
 broke out and it was because as a 
revenge, as a retaliation against the 
Jews, because this man had murdered a German
 diplomat. But what I know was that Jewish 
stores were attacked. They were raided. 
The synagogues were burning. They were raided.

People stole, demolished and in general most 
Jewish males were picked up and sent to a 
concentration camp. The duration during that tim
e in the concentration camp was relatively 
short from what happen Œ will happen later on. After approximately two weeks most people 
were sent back to their homes. Now this was 
in '38. Already between '33 and '38 a lot of 
Jews had lost their civil rights. As for instan
ce my father, who was a lawyer, he was already 
debarred. He could no longer go to the courts a
nd he Œ doctors had lost their privileges in 

hospitals. Actors could no longer act on the, 
on the public stages, and so forth and so on. 
Also in 1935 with the Nuremberg laws, a lot of
 discrimi nation against Jews occurred. There 
was no longer inter-marriage possible. Ther
e was no longer relationship with non-Jews 
possible. You couldn't even visit a Christian 
home. You no longer could have a ma id. If you 
had one who was Œ had to be over 45 years of
 age, because I think the Germans were 
horrified at the thought that their German ra
ce could be possibly defame d by some  act. 
Anyway also just before that time, during a
ll these years between '33 and '38, I recall for 
instance that a friend of mi ne who always play
ed with me , who we always together Œ one 
day she came and said, "I can no longer come 
to your home." And I sa
id, "How come ? "  And 
she said, "Well, my father told me I'm no 
longer allowed to play with you because you're 
Jewish." So this friend disappeared and I neve
r saw her again. Other friends, Jewish friends, 
Jewish children who lived in my neighborhood, left
 from one day to the next because they 
immi grated maybe with their parents or they
 went across the border to another country. 
Whatever, it was a terrible time of real tu
rmoil and repression, and in 1938 after the 
Kristallnacht, my family in Holland tried to get me to Holland with a children's transport.  
 
01:06:30 
 
 
My father Œ my parents were di
vorced at that time already and my 
father was traveling in Europe and in Israel 
and trying to see how they could establish a new 
place where we could live. When he came back
 from Palestine in 19Œ I believe it was 1932, 
he proposed to the family that we should leav
e immediately but my mother did not want to 
and she refused to go. So when he went later to
 the different countries to see where he could 
get a permit to stay, it became already very, very
 difficult because each country only let in so 
many so-called ﬁforeigners.ﬂ In 1938 at that time 
he had a permit to stay for six months in 
Holland, and when I did not come with the childre
n's transport because my papers were lost, 
he and my uncle went to the Dutch authoritie
s. My uncle was a very energetic ma n who 
really pulled his weight Œ went into a meeting and said he has to have papers to get me out of 

the country and into Holland, and he did get a 
permit. And he called us at night and my 
mother took me to the German border and we 
Œ my uncle's chauffeur was comi ng across the 
border and picked me up and withered me th
rough the German and the Dutch border guards 
and helped me  cross the border and so I came to Holland. Now in 1938 life was pretty 
norma l in Holland. But we were, of course, stra
ngers and first stayed with my family in 
Tilburg, and later on I came to live in Amsterdam. 
But, but because of the work of my father 
Œ he was very rarely there and we lived in a boarding house and I Œ there was really no good 

home life to speak of. And we always played 
with the idea that we had to leave Holland 
because there was really no good future for us.

My father worked at that time with the 
Dutch authorities who dealt Œ Dutch Jewish 
authorities, who dealt with resettling refugees, Jewi
sh refugees. He also played a role at that 
time in as a Dutch delegate to the ship St. L
ouis, who was not allowed to land in Cuba. And 
he went to, at that time, to Belgium to he
lp rescue the people and settle in so many only. 
Each country tried to take a number of pe
ople. And Holland took some . And so he was 
involved with this work, so he was really very
 rarely there. And towards 1940 we were able 
to get a permit to get to America and in 
May 9th, 1940 we took the 
few belongings we had 
brought out of Germany, we took those and took 
them to the boat in, in Rotterdam, and we 
were supposed to sail with the Veendam 
the next morning, May the 10th, 1940. May, May 
10th, 1940 came. I woke up in the morning and 
I hear these funny little sounds and I look out 
and I see puffy little clouds in the sky and all the Dutch houses, apartment houses, have very 
flat roofs and I see people on the roof, and I wonder what's going on. Anyway I went up on 
the roof and I see and I was told that German planes were flying overhead and they had 

invaded Holland during the night. And I woke up 
my dad and I said, ﬁI don't think we'll be 
going to America.ﬂ Well, that was it, we 
didn't go. And 19Œ May 10th, this happened, and 
fi ve days later the Germans capitulated Œ I 
mean the Dutch capitulated and the Germans 
occupied Holland. And pretty soon the German 
occupation started of Holland and of course 
with the occupation, all the repressions agai
nst the Jews started, started out. I cannot 
remember exactly how it started out but what
 happened was that you no longer could pursue 
your work in, in non-Jewish businesses. Slowly 
things were taken away from you. Your civil 
rights were taken slowly away. It was rea
lly a repeat of what happŒ had happened in 

Germany. You had to wear a yellow star. Pre
tty soon you could no longer shop in the stores. 

There were certain hours only between three a
nd five in the afternoon. You could no longer 
go out as much as you wanted at night because
 you had to be in. There was a curfew. You 
couldn't even sit Œ if you had a garden, you couldn'
t even sit outside in your garden after the 
curfew hours, so Œ . 
 
01:12:07 
 
Q: What was this like for you as a young person?   
 
A: Well, it wasn't  very easy to grow up as
 a young person like that. It, it was a very bad 
existence and the trouble was that each day 
some thing new happened and some thing more 
repressive happened. And the thoughts were alwa
ys in the mi nd, ﬁHow can we escape from 
this and how Œ what can we do? ﬂ The only 
possibility would have been to go underground. 
But that was very difficult and it was very 
dangerous because you had to have the right 
connection to people who would hide you 
underground. You had to have the right 
accommodations for underground, because you couldn't live freely because we all had an 

accent. So, people who had an accent were imme di
ately prone to be discovered, even with a 
false passport or false ID paper or whatever 
it is. So for a long time we were thinking how 
we could do that, how we could possibly find 
a refuge this way. There were people hidden 
on the attic. There were people hidden in cella
rs. There were people hidden in back rooms 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0035

for years and years by Dutch peasants, by 
Dutch peo-people of good will and good heart. 
There were also people who were
 betrayed, but we really never reached that stage because it 
was not possible. 
 
01:13:40 
 
Q: Had you ma de friends in Holland?  
 
A: I had a few friends. I did not 
have very ma ny friends. I Œ most of my friends were refugees 
themselves. I did go to a school for refugees
, a special school because of the language 
problems but we did get some instructions 
and I finished high school in Holland. And my 
father worked at that time, as I had menti
oned before, for a Dutch Œ for a Jewish refugee 
organization which later on turned partially into
 the Jewish Council and I later myself had a 
small job in the sewing division, making clothes 
for people, for German people really as far 
as I know. We  never knew exactly for whom we were working and so I had a Œ also want to 

mention that during that during all this peri
od I mentioned before, I believe it was in 1942, 
that we all had to wear a yellow star. This ye
llow star had to be on 
the left side of your 
clothing. If you wore three layers that day it had 
to be on three layers 
of your clothing. It had 
to be attached. There was Œ you were not allo
wed to be able to put one finger through the 
behind between your clothing and 
the star. It had to be sewn on properly, and if somebody 
saw you on the street, you had to ha
ve ID papers, the proper ID papers with a ﬁJﬂ in it and 
your yellow star and if some thing was wrong, 
you were arrested. And you didn't come  back 
or ma ybe you were arrested and were sent on some where right away.  
 
01:15:36 
 
 Well, also during that time, as I had mentioned to you before, during the night many times 
the, the SS
2
 or the police Œ not the Dutch police but the German patrol, police or whatever 
their designation was Œ came to various homes, looked for Jews, wanted to see their ID 
papers, wanted to see whether they had special
 permits to stay away from being sent for 
relocation in the east, and these special st
amps were sometimes that you had a Œ you did 
quote, unquote, "a very important work" or that
 you had the possibility of getting a visa to 
get out of Holland via Portugal or that maybe 
you had instead of four Jewish grandparents 
you had only three Jewish grandparents. There 
were a variety of little stamps, which were 
possible in your ID card which would delay your 
transport, but it didn't prevent it. So we 
were Œ I personally was arrested at least three 
times during the night, taken to a special place 
which usually was the place which at one time 
was a Jewish theater. And you never really 
knew whether you would be rel
eased again, what would happen to you the next day. We  
were sitting around, we were wondering and wo
rrying what would happen, but on July the 
6th in 1943 was the biggest razzia, repression against the Jews. They, they Œ big cars with SS 
were driving through the different streets with 
the bullhorns on top of the cars and they were 
calling all the Jews to leave their buildings
. Now for weeks and weeks and months and

months we knew that this day will come  one da
y and we always had prepared ourselves in a 
sense by having a backpack ready with a few be
longings to take with us. We  knew that we 
were not allowed to take many things, but th
ey would allow us one change, one sweater, a 
toothbrush, a pair of extra shoes, an overall and maybe a coat. 
 
01:18:14 
 
Q: How did you know that?  How did you know that would happen?  
 
A: It was known through the Jewish community. 
It was ma de known from the Germans to the 
Jewish community that this is what is allo
wed. There is not allowed anymore. So you knew 
that your day will come and you didn't know when 
and you knew that this is if you ever have 
to go away, this is what you can take with you. 
That day when we were all called out of the 
houses, we Œ they ma rched us from wherever 
you lived to the central point. It could be 
around the corner. It could be a half an hour aw
ay, whatever it was, we were gathered all 
around. We are standing in the courtyard of th
e building for a whole day. We  did not know 

what was going to happen to us. They didn't 
give us any food, no water, anything. We ll, 
towards late afternoon one of the highest SS 
was comi ng to the building, and he was doing 
the selecting of who would be sent away a
nd who would not be sent away. And one by one 
we were called up to appear before him to s
how him our papers and he would decide. When 
my father's turn came, he said to him, ﬁMr.
 Moser, you have to decide whether you and your 
daughter will go on transport or whether you will 
stay behind.ﬂ He would not dispense both 
of us from transport but he w
ould Œ considered my father to stay behind, so my dad decided 
that he would stay behind, hoping that, you know
, he could do some thing for me , he would 
be able to get me  out of this again. And we 
were Œ those who had to leave right away were 
reassembled and ma rching in fours down the st
reet and I looked back and I saw my dad 
looking out the window as, as we were leavi
ng that street and that building. We were 
marched towards the stadium where a big mass of people were already comi ng from the 

various neighborhoods in Amsterdam, reassemble
d in that stadium. And in that stadium 
were rows of tables with Germans sitting w
ho were registering us by name , by ID, taking 
everything we had like watches, rings, whatever we had of any little value Œ took it away 

from us.  
 
01:21:03 
 
 But they left us with that rucksack. They went through it, too, mi nd you. They looked 
through what was in it. So, then in Amsterdam 
at that time the trams were running but there 
was Œ that morning there was absolutely nobody on 
the street. They put us into the trams and 
the trams started to roll and we did not know 
Œ we knew that we are going on transport. We  
knew that we were going to go to the camp in
 Holland which called We sterbork, but we did 
not know by what means we were going. They took us with the trams and these tramways 

were accompanied on each side by huge limousines in
 which all filled with SS just so that 
nobody could leave the tram, nobody could escape.
 They were running over the pavement, 
over the sidewalks of the street and if there 
were any people they had to flee up into their 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0035

apartments and houses and, and roadways Œ I mean
 entrances so that they wouldn't be just 
crushed on by, by these SS people. But we came 
to a small railroad station in Amsterdam 
where the cattle trains were already waiting fo
r us. Germans were standing around with big Œ 
what do you call it?  Big dogs, shepherd dogs
, and pacing, pacing up and down the quays, 
loading the people into the cattle cars and I sort
 of twaddled around, I was trying to hide first 
between some lamp posts, a little house and so forth, and I was seeing whether it's possible 
for me to escape from this, but I really wouldn'
t Œ didn't know because even if I were able to 
leave that railroad station, where was I going to
 go since I didn't know before where. But it 
was just sort of an instinct, ﬁMaybe they can't
 catch me.ﬂ Well they did and of course I was 
one of them in the cattle trucks and we went
. They closed the doors and we still were in a 
fairly cooperative spirit, you know. We try to sort
 of console our Œ one 
another and late at 
night we arrived in the camp. We couldn't even really see the camp Œ  
 
01:23:52 
 
Q: Tell me a little bit about the trip, what it was like on the train?  
 
A: That, that trip, contrary to the trip in the ca
ttle truck to Bergen-Belsen, that trip Œ I remember 
there were a lot of young people. I didn't 
know anybody. But I know there were a lot of 
young people in that particular compartment 
I was in. The ride was maybe three hours. 
Contrary to the other trip I took Œ for days in
 a cattle truck Œ  there was a much better mood 
than there was later on. You had lived so long with the knowledge that you would be picked 
up one day, that you would be se
nt away one day, that you would go to We sterbork one day, 
that now it happened. It was done. You were on 
the way. I mean it was nearly like no longer 
Œ you didn't have to expect it any longer. It was 
there, which is really a terrible thing, but, but 
it was nearly like a relief because they couldn't Œ they picked you up, but you knew this was 

it, it couldn't happen over and over again. So when
 we arrived finally at night in the camp, it 
was already dark. We , we didn't know exac
tly how that camp would look. We  knew it 
smelled when we arrived there. It, it wasn't  a 
very pleasant smell. And we were given Œ we 

had to go through another registration, mi nd you. Th
at was the second one that day, but that 
was more that like a receipt, ﬁYes, these 
people have arriven,ﬂ you know. And we were, 
were told to go to various barracks. We came 
there. There was no light 
in front of it. There 
was only this terrible stench, and you entered 
the barrack and you barely saw anything. You, 
you saw a lot of things that you knew some thing 
Œ there was a lot of stuff toward the ceiling 
but you didn't really quite realize what it was. 
Your eyes had to adjust for a long time, and 
you wanted to find Œ what do you call it?  Can you cut it a mi nute?  
 
01:26:34 
 
Q: A cot?  A bed?  
 
A: A cot. Yes, a cot. So we Œ I found some thi
ng on the third level and I climbed up there with 
my backpack and I came to lay next to a wo
ma n. I didn't know her. She didn't know me . But 
I remember we talked long into the night of how
 we got there and what our experiences were 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0035

and so forth and so on. And the next days in th
e camp we were put to work, real silly work. 
We had to carry sand from one place to the othe
r. It didn't make sense, but we had to do it, 
and as time went by they organized us into a va
riety of tasks, what we had to do. We ll, I was 
really delegated to a place where we were 
sewing clothing, again se
wing clothing, for Œ I'm 
not quite sure for whom it was. That was the 
whole day. Some times we would Œ I worked at 
a Dutch, but this was a Nazi, a Dutch Nazi farmer
's farm. He had us clean out the pig sties. 
He had us work around his farm, clean up certain 
things. He had us work in the potato fields, 
or whatever, so that he didn't have so much Œ 
we were slaves to him. He profited from, from 
the camp being so nearby and from being a Nazi
 and collaborating with the Germans. And as 
a reward he would sit us with the chickens in
 the yard and give us a watery soup. That was 
the meal for the day. And we had to wear the Dutch klompen,
3
 you know, the Dutch wooden 
shoes and if you're not used to it and you 
have no socks and you have nothing proper to 
protect you, these things are very hard and 
you had blisters every day. And every morning 
before you went to work there was some body w
ho took a needle and punched those blisters. 
It was not very good. Anyway, this time passed t
oo and a lot of illnesses broke out already in 
this camp and I remember that I got jaundice and I was very sick.  
 
01:29:27 
 
 I mean I was so nauseated and so ill. And I di
dn't say that before, but every Tuesday night Œ 
every Tuesday the lists of those people who 
were going to be sent to Auschwitz Œ we 
assume d it was Auschwitz, we didn't know one 
hundred percent, but the trains came back 
from Auschwitz. Usually the conductor or some
body would let on where they came  from, to 
pick up more people and to send them off to 
away and towards the east. Well lists were 
assembled during the day on Monday and on Tuesda
y they were read off in the barracks. A 
Kapo
4
 came to the barracks and was reading off 
the name s of those who were sent away. 
And as you can imagine this was some horrible, horrible times. People finding out that this 
was really probably the end or they Œ we 
didn't know hundred percent what was going on in 
Auschwitz. We , we knew it was terrible but we 
didn't know exactly how terrible it was. And 
everybody would help always those who had to 
leave the camp. They would help them to 

assemble their stuff, to console them, to give
 them whatever they had, a little food left to 
give them on the way. And it was ma ybe four m
onths after that I was in this camp Œ the 
trains from the razzias, from the raids on the 
Jews from Amsterdam and other locations in 
Holland, these trains came all the way in
to the camp compound. So each afternoon we 
always heard by Œ there was always an 
underground kind of a communication. I don't know 
how one found out. There were people who had sp
ecial permits, maybe, who went in and out 
of the camp. One got little messages. This day one got the message that a big raid on 
Amsterdam had picked up the rest of the Jews, or
 nearly the rest of the Jews who still were 
in Amsterdam and we went to meet the train. 
You could Œ were able to do that, to go the 
quays and sure enough my father and his wife were on the train.

 And of course it was the same  story for hi
m, you know. He was integrated into doing some  
kind of labor in the camp, but end of the y
ear 1944 Œ I think it was early September Œ we 
were all sent to Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in Germany. And we packed up our 
belongings. We went out to the train. Ther
e were the SS with the dogs. There was no 
escaping. There was no hiding. You Œ there was 
no means. If somebody didn't step into the 
train, people were shot. That was 
the end. So we left. We came to another ride but that was at 
least two days if not longer in the cattle tr
uck. And compared with the first ride and 
experience in the cattle truck going fr om Amst
erdam to Westerbork, this was a much sadder 
story because we knew nothing good was expec
ting us, even worse than the camp in 
Holland, and that camp had a Œ I'm sorry, that cattle truck had some benches in there. It, it 

was just a wooden plank. It wa
s filled with people. You couldn't lie on the floor. You could 
stand up. You could ma ybe if you were lucky 
you got in between, you could sit on one of 
those benches. There was a big vat and that 
was the toilet for everybody for two and a half 
days. There was no food. There was no drink. 
There was nothing. They didn't Œ the doors 
didn't open. There was a little slit in, in the 
cattle truck and you could look out sometimes, 
but you didn't know where you were. I m
ean you only knew you were rolling, rolling, 
rolling. When we arrived in at the station 
closest to the camp, which was in northern 
Germany, in the Lüneburger Heide, the doors finally opened and we were told to get out. 
 
01:34:40 
 
 Weakened and not very good condition already because of this days we pass in the cattle 
truck. And I'll never forget–. First of all I personally was kicked by an SS to get out, and so 
I really fell out of the truck. But when I got
 up on my, my legs, I looked up and I saw this 
bridge going Œ a street reall
y, a bridge, a street Œ going across the rails and there were 
children on this bridge looking down on us a
nd yelling ﬁdirty Jewsﬂ and throwing rocks. 
And I always remembered this because after the war I was told so many times, ﬁWell, we 
didn't know anything about anything.ﬂ And I neve
r forget these children standing there. How 
come  they knew? How come  they always Œ they
 waited for these for these railroad cars to 
arrive. They knew. I know ma ny more knew, 
but these children knew. We ll, anyway we 
were then led to ma rch towards the camp, wh
ich was a long march, and I remember it was 

through a beautiful birch forest and I kept l
ooking at the birches and I thought, ﬁThis is so 
beautiful. How can this be? How is it possible th
at here we are the way, like cattle, they are 

pushing us to ma rch along? ﬂ Nobody was Œ could stay behind. If some body broke down, 

you had had gotten a kick, you know. When we a
rrived in the camp we were assigned to 
certain barracks and there the barracks were much narrower, much higher, many more, more 

bunks closer together and instead of one pers
on to a bunk, we were assigned two persons to 
one bunk. There was a little straw on the bunk and I ended up with Hannelore, who was my 
father's second wife. We  shared a bunk and we 
also shared the water, which was dripping 
from through the ceiling into our bunk. So we had 
this tiny little space to us where we had to 
put our belongings, whatever we had, plus our
selves. Two tall people in this little bunk with

the straw. But we shared a raincoat and so we spread that raincoat at night over us. And in 
the morning you looked up and there was a puddle in
 the mi ddle of it between the two of us. 
And we had to some how get rid of the water if we didn't want to splash it just over overboard 

so to speak.  
 
01:37:52 
 
 Well, the food was mi nimal, to say the least.
 It was very bad. It was a watery soup as 
rutabagas, the smallest portion of bread which 
had to last for a whole week. Some  people ate 
it up right away because they were
 so afraid that that it mi ght not be there when you went to 
work and you came back at night that some body 
mi ght have stolen it, the smallest amount. 
So some people ate it right away. Some people 
were hiding it in some  ingenious way. Some 
people couldn't make Œ couldn't, couldn't last fo
r the whole week because it was really such a 
small portion. And the rutabagas were, were awful,
 too, because most of them were hard and 
if Œ I have seen people who did not eat
 the Œ you know, when it become s real bad, 
sometimes dried out and gray, they took them
 out. And I have seen other people pick up 
those which were taken out and chewed over by 
other people and take it just because of the 
hunger cause they had nothing really to eat. How 
one survived this I Œ to this day, when I 
look back I never understand this. I, I don't unde
rstand how we could have survived, but we 
did, with such a small amount of food. Anyway 
the work we had to do was another useless 
work. We  were assigned to cut out from unifo
rms from German soldiers which were Œ had 
either died on the eastern front or were 
shot by Œ I don't know by whom, but anyway and 
they were bloody uniforms, and we had to cut off all the buttons. We  had to cut off all little 

pieces which were not blood-drenched and th
ese were saved for whatever reason. The 
Germans needed the buttons. They needed th
e little pieces, because the war had also left 
them with very few ma terial goods and, and th
ey used it to repair other uniforms, to, you 
know, to whatever, ma ke do. We  had to work in this from morning to night.  
 
01:40:40 
 
 But the mornings in the camp life started off that you had to go out on the A p p e l l p l a t z ,
5
 
which means the place where everybody had to a
ssemble. A huge place. All barracks had to 
come there at a certain hour, early in the mo
rning after the Kapos woke you up very early, 
and two, three SS standing there and counting us
. Every morning we were counted. Why we 
were counted I cannot tell you, but it had to be 
precise and if the numbers didn't come out, 
you had to be counted again. If it took one hour, 
if it took five hours, they didn't care. You 
had to be counted. Whether it was cold, whether it was raining, whether it was sunshine Œ 

you had to be counted and during the same time 
that we were all standing out there, they 
would run horse-drawn carriage where they 
threw the bodies of those people who were 
either shot or hanged or had di
ed from hunger, from whatever, and they wanted to ma ke sure 
that we see each morning these horse-drawn carriages drive by. And I remember one time I 
looked out and I saw on the fence two bodies 
hanging on the fence. These people were hung

there during the night. Just Œ they wanted Œ a
nd shot Œ I mean they were no longer living, but 
they let them hang there so that we could see 
it Œ what would happen to us if we ma ybe not 
obey. From the regular work you could be some tim
es selected to do some special work like 
maybe cleaning the pit toilets or, or doing so
mething around outside the camp. Like one time 
I remember I was picked out to go with one of
 the SS and a couple of other prisoners to the 
nearest village of the camp. We had to pick up something and we had to load it on this 

wagon, on this big wagon. There was no extra f
ood. There was no, not even a sip of water 

that we would get but we were asked to sta
nd by as the SS was feeding the horse the sugars 
out of his hand and we could wa
tch it. That was a treat for us. But it was very hard. It was 
very hard because you were always so hungry a
nd there was, there was nothing. I mean that 
was one of the terrible things that not only 
were you mi streated but you also were so hungry 
all the time. And I didn't know because I didn'
t have a mi rror, I didn't know how I looked. 
But my fa ther always told me  towards the end of the war, towards the end of Bergen-Belsen, 

he said I was very puffed up, that I had 
hunger, I had hunger-edema . You know, you've seen 
these little children from Asia who were blown up. Well, I wasn't  so little anymore but I was 

Œ had this and it, it was really very bad. If 
you were sick during that time, it was very bad 
because not like in, in Westerbork where there 
was still the possibility of being in a barrack 
specially you, you, you still were treated a little bit 
more humanely. But if you really got sick 
in Bergen-Belsen, that was a very bad thing. 
 
01:44:43 
 
Q: What would happen?  
 
A: You were just left  there. I mean it Œ ther
e was there was no me dication to speak of. There 
was nothing. The, the Jewish doctors had no me
ans of really helping you. I don't think there 
was an aspirin in that camp. I don't think ther
e was a bandage in that camp. I don't, I don't 
remember any of this stuff. Tough luck. I mean it was not possible. I believe it must have 

been towards the end of Œ either the very end 
of December of 1944 or in the first week of 
1945, Fräulein
6
 Doctor Slottke, Fräulein Doctor Sl
ottke Œ Miss, Miss Doctor Slottke from 
the Central Security Offi ce in Berlin arrive
d in the camp. And she called to her all those 
people who had passports either some  foreign passports. Now our family had received 

through the auspices, and a wonderful deed, of an uncle Œ who was really a cousin Œ Max 

We il. He lived in Switzerland. He was not Swi
ss. He was also German refugee, German 
Jewish refugee. He had bought passports from
 us from the Paraguayan Consul in Bern. 
These passports stated that we were Paraguaya
n citizens, parenthetically. After the war, it 
was found out that this ma n had done this on his own, trying to help people but at the same 
time I believe he pocketed all the money for hims
elf, of paying these passports. But really I 
don't care, because these passports helped our Œ 
us. And I assume  this ma n wanted to help. 
These passports interestingly enough reached us
 during the German occupation already, so 

we were able to receive it already although it 
was occupied and there was a censorship and 
all that. But we appeared in fr ont of this Fräule
in Doctor Slottke and she told us that they Œ 
 
6

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0035 
11
 
that she wanted to exchange us Paraguayans and many others who held other passports for 
Germans who were living outside Germany, who 
were not able to return, who were caught 
in the war. Who were living outside Germa
ny, and who could not get back to Germany 

unless there was an arrangement that they 
would release so ma ny Jewish prisoners for 
Germans. She said that they, we couldn't help it that we were in the state we were and that 
she–. Excuse me . Can I just drink?  That she, 
that she would arrange that we would leave by 
train and go outside Germany.  
 
01:48:59 
 
 She told us that the next morning we would have to go through a 
thorough cleansing job. By 
the way, we were many times taken to this "clean
sing bath," so to speak Œ I want to back Œ 
track a mi nute on that, and taken there because we
 were full of lice all the time. But we had 
to take off our clothes. They were put into a big machine or something like that, in a 
container and which supposedly was heated up so that it should kill these lice but they never 
were killed. They were only worse every tim
e that when you got your clothes back. And 
meantime you went Œ had to go to a shower bath and the SS Œ ma le and fema le Œ were, we 
were totally naked. We were standing around. 
They was standing there talking to one 
another, laughing their head off that we we
re all standing there in Œ with nothing on 
helplessly. And then they sent us out. I reme
mber one time standing in the snow with the 
shoes on, no clothes whatsoever. The snow wa
s on the ground. It was freezing cold; and we 
had to wait for those de-liced, so-called de-liced clothing, which always came back with the 

lice crawling more on it because they never heated it up enough; and they said they had to 

re-do it because the lice weren't killed. So we 
were standing for a coupl
e of hours before we 
got our clothes back. Now we had this expe
rience, and we thought, ﬁOh no, we'll get again 
the same story,ﬂ which we really did. But at 
the same time they also wanted us to throw 
away all the Œ whatever we had which could 
be used against the Germans as a document. 
For some reason I have few little documents left . They must have been in some seams or 

hidden away or in a pocket they didn't see becau
se when I remember Œ when I entered this, 
this hall where, where the people were processed, it was littered with paper. It was littered 
with clothing, with lice crawling over it and we 
were supposed to keep only what was on our 
bodies and as we went off we 
left the camp after this whole procedure and we thought, ﬁWas 
she telling the truth? ﬂ We didn't know whether we
 could trust her or not and as we walked 
again through the little birch forest and we 
came out and we sawŒit was a cold monthŒwe 
saw the steam comi ng up, this, this smoke ri
sing into the sky and sure enough–. We  could 
not believe it. We could not believe that th
ere was really a little train standing, which was 
apparently. We got into the train, and every compartment was heated. We were living in cold 
barracks for so long we didn't even know what
 a nice comfortable warm room felt like. I 
mean, in this case, the, the train. Well, we 
came into the train and we could not believe it 
either, because they came around and gave us something to eat.  
 
01:52:36 
 
 And said that we would go towards the Swi
ss border, that from there on we would be 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0035

exchanged against the German prisoners Œ not
 prisoners. I mean, the German people who 
were outside Germany. And they wished us, so
 to speak, a good trip. Well, we were started 
to roll and roll and we came across areas wher
e just before we had arrived there was a 
bombardment. Because already during that time 
the Germans Œ the Allies had advanced into 
Germany and there were also occasionally 
bombardme nts of various areas which was 
strategically important to the Allies. And we we
re held back at various stations because the 
train rails had to be repaired and so forth. 
And we, we made a terrible detour, I remember, 
because suddenly we saw that we were in Be
rlin and we couldn't understand it. ﬁIf we go 
directly to the Swiss border how come we 
are going through Berlin? ﬂ  And we got very 
anxious and suspicious again. But, indeed, 
we, we came through southern Germany and we 
were heading towards the Swiss border. Well,
 as you can imagine, people who had lived 
through that were not Œ their health was not th
e best. And there was one person in particular, 
I remember we stopped at a certain station, a
nd his body Œ he had died during the train ride 
and his body was taken off the train and probably 
taken to the morgue of the village where 
we had stopped. As we approached the Dutch Œ 
the Swiss border, the SS stopped the train at 
a certain point and called people who were 
responsible from the group. They assigned 
certain people Œ one of them was my dad Œ they 
called them out and told them that they had 
to tell us that only a small number of the people on the train were going really to 
Switzerland. That we were in such a bad conditi
on that we Œ they did 
not want us Œ to send 
us across the border. I guess they had a little fee
ling of shame left  or whatever. We  ended up 
in a Œ in the barracks, military barracks actually, and made one military person responsible 

for us. It was Œ we were assigned actually there 
for a couple of nights. Quite nice rooms. And 
we Œ they gave us some thing to eat. It wasn't
 very much, but we, we 
didn't have to starve 
during that time. Wasn't  too much Œ it was 
good. It wasn't  too much, because our body and 
stomach didn't tolerate any more food really. But 
what we were not quite sure of Œ what were 
they going to do with us?  Where were we going?
 We  knew that the war was towards an end, 
but we did not know Œ until the da
y we left we were not informed that they had negotiated 
with Berlin to send us back to Bergen-Bel
sen. Because the reason Berlin didn't say, "Yes, 
send them," they couldn't do it right away because the railroad tracks were even further 
damaged and the communication Œ lines of co
mmunication were severed. So that it would 
have been an eternal ride on the train, probabl
y escaping from here to there. Instead, they 
decided they would put us into an internment
 camp for the time being. And so we, we ended 

up in an internment camp; and in that internment camp were people from the islands of 
Guernsey and Jersey from England. Germans 
had occupied Guernsey and Jersey, and had 
interned most of its citizens in, in various
 camps. One of them was that camp where we 
were. During that time when we were in the camp it was very close to the end of the war. 

Was more illness, more Œ there was more help available for us because people had supplies 

from the British Red Cross. They were trying 
to de-louse us, cut off the hair because we 

were just full with lice. They gave us some 
food. They had to share Œ could share with us. 
We were getting a little more fed and a little orie
nted where we were, what happened to us; 
and on April the 23rd, 1945, the French Army liberated us. 
 
01:58:24

Q: What was that like? 
 
A: What was that like?  It was unbelievable. 
We couldn't believe that this–. We had hoped 
always that the war would end and that this would happen. But when it happened, it was so, 
so unbelievable that we should suddenly have
 our freedom again. Although we were in 
Germany and we didn't like that idea. But we we
re free. Free. And there were many Œ quite a 
number of weeks went by when we had to leave 
that camp and then we were, had to go to an 
UNRRA camp.

02:00:02 
 
A: Œ I remember my cousin, my cousin, my aunt, my uncle and a little Œ my, my little cousin. I 
mean, say little cousin Œ my cousin was only thr
ee years old, one of them, when we were in 
the camp. They Œ the boy lived with my uncle and 
the girl lived with my aunt, in the same 
bunk. I feel Œ when I look back I feel that
 communication and relations between the 
individual people were really very rough. Ther
e was because maybe of the hunger Œ I, I don't 
know. I always look back and I have always th
ese horrible pictures in front of me. People 
stealing one another Œ off one another the br
ead. It could me an life or death if you had 
enough to eat. But this didn't count. People we
re uninhibitedly stealing. I remember for 
instance there was only one toilet, and in th
e morning you had to stand in line, twenty, 
twenty-five deep or something, to go to this
 one toilet. And people were screaming and 
yelling at one another and telling them, ﬁYou can't
 stay in any longer and I pull you out.ﬂ It 
was terrible. It was because of
 their own terrible needs I guess that they became like animals 
sometimes. I, unfortunately I don't remember that it brought out the best in anybody. I don't 

remember that. I wish I would, but I don't. I re
member, for instance, other things that people 
because of the hunger, because of this, for some  reason they were standing together and 

exchanging recipes. There were imaginary c
ooking sessions. There were dreams about Œ I 
reme mber with Hannelore, we were talking about if we'r e ever liberated, what would we do 
in terms of Œ we would buy a lo
af of bread, buy coffee, jam and butter and prepare all of this, 
lock the door in a room, and do nothing but eati
ng this bread, butter, jam and jelly, and, and 
coffee. This was our dream. We repeated it.
 This was our hope. We had the strangest 
experiences in these camps. For instance, ther
e Œ one of the guards, she was called ﬁThe 
Blonde,ﬂ she would come  through the barracks 
and there was one woma n who had a baby Œ 
who, of course, died, because a baby cannot survive at all under those circumstances. But she 

would have it the weakness, sort of, and told
 the woma n that she also has a baby, and she 
would try and get her some  food for the baby. A
nd she visited her until the baby died, really 
nearly every day. Turning her around, she w
ould come through the barracks every second 
day or so; and you had to have your bunk ma de up 
in such a perfect manner, totally straight. 
There was not allowed that there was one 
little fold somewhere, one little wrinkle or 
anything. She would pull it away and she would ma
ke sure that your rations were cut out if, 
if she ever would fi nd that this was not perf
ect. She also didn't mi nd to use her little whip on 
people. And here she was that she was so c
oncerned about the baby because she identified 
with this woma n and, and her own child Œ strangest occurrences.  
 
02:04:53 
 
Q: What personally enabled you to get through?  
 
A: Well, I, I think a couple of things that Œ 
hope that you had sort of the Œ way down some thing 
told you maybe, maybe we, we, we have to get out 
of this. We can't  survive Œ we, we have to 
survive I mean, somehow. That this someth
ing was telling you, you have to and hope that 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0035 
15
 
you will, and ma ybe that you were young and conf
ident somehow that luck will be on your 
side. 
 
Q: Shall we backtrack from liberation. Appa
rently luck was on your side and you were 
liberated. 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Pick up there again. 
 
A: When, when we were in UNRRA camp, it was 
Œ it, it should have been a new beginning. It 
was a new planning. It was a ne
w thinking. ﬁWhere do we go from here?  What are our, our 
possibilities to go from where? ﬂ We  could not go back to Germany. We  did not want to go 
back to Germany. To go to Holland?  Yes, we 
wanted to go to Holland; but we also knew 
that we had wanted to leave Holland at one tim
e. So we had to, to ma ke a plan to use 
Holland only as a temporary place of, of, of soj
ourn, that we had to hopefully get to America 

or to Israel. Israel was not possible for us at
 the time. So America was more, more likely for 

us at that time. It was a matter of time, ever
ything, but we had already so much times waited 
and spent and suffered. We , we wanted already to arrive some where.  
 
02:07:10 
 
 There was a possibility for me to go much ear
lier than my father, because I was born in 
Germany. And the German quota to come to the 
United States was much smaller because the 
Americans rightfully did not want the Germans to 
at that time to come to America. They had 
to be de-Nazified, or they wanted to ma ke 
sure who it was so the only German-born people 
were essentially a few exception scientists and so forth. And the German-born Jews, because 
that quota was more open. My father, who was 
born in France, Strasbourg, had to wait much 
longer than I did. So I went back to Holland. I 
was able to get to go back to Holland in 194Œ 
end of 1947. This was nearly thr
ee years after the war. Oh, longer Œ more than three years 
after the war. And after a few months in Holland, 
I finally was able to get a visa to come to 
the United States. And the nice part of this was 
that when we had left  Œ when we tried to 
leave Holland in 1940, we were going to go with
 the Holland-America line to America. And 
we had booked the tickets. And the ma n who was in
 charge of the office in Rotterdam, for 
some  reason because of my father's work 
he knew my dad. And when I came to Holland, 
after I had gotten my visa in Rotterdam, I 
said, "Well, let me see. I go by the Holland-
America line." I had no money, really, to come
 to America, to go on the boat; but I went 
there, and I said, "Let me try." I said Œ I go in there and I said Œ I told my story, that I had left 

Œ was supposed to leave that time, that I never 
used the ticket and is it possible to use it now. 
And so the clerk to whom I spoke said, "Just 
a mi nute." And he went into the office of the 
head of this office, the director; and the dir
ector was there. And he came out personally, and 
he called me  into his office. And he, he, he wa
s absolutely fantastic. But he was so nice and 
so stunned about the whole story I had to tell hi
m. He said, "There's no question that we will 

honor your ticket." And not only did he send me  
to America on that boat with the ticket we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0035 
16
 
had paid so ma ny years before, he put me  into
 first class. And so I came to America on the 
first class, on the, on the Dutch liner. And he al
so honored, of course, my father's ticket. And 
this was a few years later. So when he came to
 the United States, he al
so came with the same 
boat; and this was really a wonderful gesture of this ma n.  
 
02:10:37 
 
Q: What happened to the other me mbers of your family?  
 
A: Well, that story is Œ my close Œ those memb
ers who were really caught in, in this terrible 
storm were my grandparents from my mother's
 side. My grandparents never left Germany. 
They never were able to, to get out or to es
cape it, and we know from letters we have gotten 
and from facts that my grandparents were 
deported to Lódz ghetto in Poland in 1942. And 
we also know that my grandfather died in Lódz, because my grandmother wrote it to her 
sister in Amsterdam. And since we lived in Am
sterdam I, you know, I was able to, to get that 
me ssage from, from this aunt. And what we 
later found out, my, my Œ the brother of my 
mother, uncle I have and we went back to Fr
ankfurt and we went to this house where my 

grandparents lived 'til the end, before they were deported. We  know Œ from, from the 
engineer who lived in this house Œ they said 
that my grandparents were picked up and that 
day and put on one of those wagons, thrown
 on these wagons. My grandfather was over 
eighty at that time, and he Œ his health wasn
't  very good. He never lived very long in the 
ghetto, in Lódz; and my poor grandmother su
rvived the ghetto, but then was sent to 
Auschwitz and of course never came back fr
om Auschwitz. And my father's  family, my 
grandmother and grandfather were dead at that 
time. They died before Hitler even. My father 
had some  cousins in Berlin who did not survive 
the war in Germany and our family is rather 

small. My cousins in Holland and, and their parent
s, my father's brother and his sister-in-law 
and their two children, survived the war in a si
milar fashion than we did. Except after the 
war, when they were liberated, they could go 
back to Holland much earlier than we could 
because they were originally Dutch citizens. 
 
02:13:30 
 
Q: But you went on to America?  
 
A: Yes,yes. 
 
Q: And what was it like there? 
 
A: Oh, in the beginning it was very strange. It wa
s very difficult for me. It Œ because I, I was 
shocked, because I arrived and maybe an hour later people started to ask me, ﬁHow do you 
like America? ﬂ I didn't know how I liked Ameri
ca. How can I know how I liked America?  I 
mean, I was overwhelmed, with everything and 
I had to go out and find a room, a job, had Œ 
it was a cultural shock for me. It took me quite a while till I got adjusted. I was very 

depressed in the beginning when I came to AmericaŒ 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0035 
17
 
 
Q: What city did you come  to?  
 
A: To New York. I only really started to feel
 good when I went to Charlottesville, Virginia, 
where we had some  wonderful cousins. And I 
went to school; and slowly Œ and I also found 
some friends there. One was actually another 
survivor, but I slowly got absorbed into Œ 
learned about American society and about fam
ily life and all the good things which I did not 
really experience so much in New York. I don'
t think it's a good Œ it was the best place to 
come  to being–. If I had been received in a fam
ily or if I had Œ it, it wasn't  so Œ I had to 
struggle by myself mosŒ ma inly. I had one nice experience, you know, I lived in Œ and a very 
strange experience Œ I lived in a in a room whic
h I rented from also a refugee family and I 
got quite friendly with one of th
e girls. And years later, I think forty years later or something. 
I'm here in Washington and I belong to, to an
 independent congregation. And one night Œ it's 
a community actually Œ and one night over coffee different people tell one another their story 
and talk to one another. And I find out that th
e woman I'm talking to is the daughter of that 
family where I, where I had a room when I fi
rst came to America. She's one of my very good 
fr iends. Then after Charlottesville, I came to
 Washington; and I was a member of the 
international student house, where I met my husband and life started to get good.  
 
02:16:40 
 
Q: And do you have any children?  
 
A: I have two children Œ two boys, Michael a
nd David. And they are both ma rried, have both 
wonderful families; and I have two grandchildren now. 
 
Q: And what about your father?  He came over, I presume, afterwards?  
 
A: Yes, and he lived in New York. He worked for a Jewish self-help organization for ma ny, 
many years. He remarried once more, and he died
 three and a half years ago. He was nearly 
ninety years old, and he was wi
dowed just two years before he died. And during the last two 
years of his life, he, he went Œ he traveled 
enormously and he was able to enjoy really 
everything more than he ever had before then, 
until the last six months of his life when he 
got very ill. 
 
Q: We 'r e comi ng to the end of the tape, and I'm Œ I'd like to ask you two things. One, if there's 
anything that you feel that you've left out, anything you'd like to add, and Œ  
 
A: I don't know. I don't remember exactly.  
 
Q: You don't reme mber what you don't remember. 
And two, in general Œ can you formulate in 
general how your experiences in the war affected you?  
 
A: Oh, I'm sure they affected me
 a lot. I would say they certainly affected my self-confidence

for years. They certainly affected my own self-v
alue for years. I'm sure they affected me in 
relationships and trust in other people for years. 
I'm sure they still affect me in terms of if I 
see police or uniforms or Œ still do. I think truly 
that if I have regained any of these it was 
really due to my husband, who has helped me  
a great deal in overcoming some of these 
fears, the self-value, and all of that.  
 
Q: Thank you very much. 
 
A: Thankyou.

[Showing photographs] 
 
A: OK. These are my maternal grandparents, 
Alice and Louis Bloch, picture taken I assume 
when they were very young, ma rry picture perhaps. 
 
[Technical conversation] 
 
A: This is a picture of my parents, Else and 
Alfred Moser. I don't know when it was taken but I 
assume it must be very early in their marriage. 
 
[Technical conversation] 
 
A: This is a picture Œ family picture I s
hould say, but my grandparents, my paternal 
grandparents are on this picture. The man with
 a moustache is my grandfather Julius Moser 
and the lady with the deep-seated eyes my gr
andmother Bertha Moser and the man with the 
small moustache is her brother Max Weil. The young girl standing is a cousin of my father's, 

Alice Sternheimer, and I'm not sure who the young boy is but I, I guess it™s her, her brother. I 
don't know. But as I look at this picture, it's interesting Œ this must be taken around 1915, I 
figure Œ the bowl you see standing there with the ch
erries on it, painted on it. I remember that 
my grandmother had that bowl when I was little girl. I always admi red that bowl.  
 
[Technical conversation] 
 
A: This is a picture of myself. 
I must have been between four and five years old, ready to go to 
masked ball. 
 
[Technical conversation] 
 
A: This is the Star of David we had to wear on our clothing starting 
1942 in Holland. It had, like 
I said in my interview, it had to be attach
ed to your clothing on every piece of clothing you 
were wearing. You see that it says, in Dutch, ﬁJew.ﬂ
