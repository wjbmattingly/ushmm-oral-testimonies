ly come from a wer Œ now it™s a s

by 
Kraków

Hunga ry

Q: Mm-hm. And was the relations good ge
nerally fo Œ in th

A: I never knew any difference, so I rea
lly, when  people talk about anti-Semitism 
and this and that, I don™t Œ I didn™t Œ I di
dn™t feel any, you kn

awhile or Œ later on the Polish Œ the teach 
Œ teacher of Po lish would say, you don™t 
say it™s Œ it™s a st Œ it stands in a Œ it 
stands in a newspaper, that™s a German 
expression, which of course you pick it 
up from if they were talking Yiddish at 

home, you know, th-they tranpor Œ transported 
that into Polish, and that Œ that™s the 
only thing I remember the teacher says, thathe says don™t say that because that™s not 

good Po lish, and that was the only thing. 
But I Œ I didn™t see any difference, I mean,

I played with them and went 
to school with th em and Œ and I did ev en a sinful thing 
because sometimes w e would feed them ham sandwiches, and Œ 
Q: How would you desc
ribe yourself as a child? We
re you outgoing, or were you 
quiet? 

A: Oh, I was very outgoing
 and very curious. Any 
[indecipherable]
 that did Œ I was 
always very inquisitive, why is it so, and 
a Œ and Œ and Œ and ho
w it could Œ it Œ how 
is it that is so and so . And it was in the 
same  school that Œ I don™t know wh at grade 
he was, but anyhow, the Œ there was a time
 when the ve Œ Vien
nese Jews came  to 
Poland
. And of course they were very rich 
and brought their stuff and bought houses 
and all that, and Œ but the kids had to come 
to school with us. And a Œ they didn™t sp 
Œ wh en th ey Œ the parents always spoke Ge
rman, but the kids would answer them in 
Polish. And Œ but there was this one who, we
ll I think we were just so jealous of her 
because she was big and Œ and she had a maid
 who carried her satchel to school. But 
of course she was so heavy that she couldn™t
 carry all th is stuff. And there were four 
of us going along th e side Œ in the Œ 
Beniki
(ph) there was this Œ this close to the 
Vistula 
river, so there™s this part where you 
walk, but Œ but then it comes down. Not 
in a ditch, but it just Œ and the bank lowe
rs a little bit towards 
the street. And lo w Œ 
we all Œ there were four friends of us, a
nd we all wish we™d got togeth er, and so 
whenever this girl and the 
maid would come, we wouldn™t let her through. And one 
day, I don™t know why, one 
of us, some newcomer came  and she Œ sh-she join ed the

group and it came so that we pushed this 
other gir Œ not the girl, but the maid fell 
down . And so she went to the school and 
sh e complained that we are misbehaving 
and all that kind of stuff, and then the teacher called us in and then the principal 
called us in, and then the teacher said Œ ca
use she went to the pr
incipal and then the 
principal told the teacher that Œ what kind 
of children she™s bringing up. Course, that 
was a class of 40 kids, so she couldn™t rea
lly watch over everyone. But she says to 
us, why did you push th em, or did you push
 her? And somebody says, because she is 
a Jew. And the teacher said, uh-
uh, then you w
ould push Holy 
Ma ry
 in the ditch too. 
No, never. How would we? She said, oh 
yes you would, a
nd you would put 
Jesus
 in 
a ditch, too. And we said why? She says
, because they were Jews. And of course, 
nobody ever told us that, 
you know, you always talk about
 all this other stuff. And 
we had a religion class every day, so the Je
wish girls went to school, th-they had a 
free period, and then  on Œ when  they
 had to go to school, I think on
 
Sunday they  had 
their religious school, so for religion they 
went to their own rabbi. And so there was 
Œ I had an  afet Œ uncle who was an atheist,
 and he all Œ and th is preacher Œ I mean, 
this religion teacher always
 says, any questions? And th
is uncle of mine always 
would ask Œ say ask hi
m about this and that, and ther
e were all kinds of questions, 
you know, that a priest couldn
™t really answer to s Œ little 
children. And so this day, 
it Œ I™m just keep on
, you know, telling him 
[indecipherable]
 when he said, are there 
any questions, I say, yeah, y
eah, he Œ but he just want 
Œ disregarded me, because he 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure

12
didn™t want any stupid questions again. Bu
t I almost knock his glasses off, and I say 
Œ so he says okay, now wh at is it t
oday? And I say, is this true that 
J-Jesus
 was a 
Jew? And he say, yeah, and his mo ther and 
his apostles and the first Christians were 
Jews. And th en I say, how co me we neve
r knew  about it, you know. But anyhow, I 
think that from that moment on, mine attit
ude toward Jews was changed. You know 
there was that, before when 
I Œ wh en I looked Œ course, you couldn™t tell who was a 
Jew if they were not having the 
itzkeys
(ph) and all that kind of stuff, and the 
mitzkeys
(ph) on top, or 
howarts
(ph) with all this stuff, 
you couldn't tell. But then 
since that time I keep look
ing, you know, whether I Œ 
cause there was this stupid 
idea that I recognize 
Jesus
 in one of them, but I mean Œ anyhow, that™s how my 
attitude Œ I never had 
any non-attitude toward Jews 
since they were my school 
friends, okay, and school friends don™t ta
lk about religion. You talk about your 
school things, and your girl
 things and you don™t talk 
about big things. But since 
then I Œ I was more friendly, and how wo
uld I say? Yeah, more interested, you 
know. And so th
en when I was 
[indecipherable]
 my best friend was
 Sarah 
Feldman
 and they lived on the co
rner there. By the way in
 the same house that the 
pope used  to live as a little boy. And th at was on the 
Vistula
 river. W-We live on 
this corner, on the 
Debieniczka
(ph) market, and on th e other one, 
Sara h Feldman
 
live in this house, and here™s some place 
lived the present pope 
as a young boy. And 
Sarah
 was telling me something about the 
Diaspora
, you know. Course, it wasn™t 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure

13
called 
Diaspora
 in those days, but she says 
[indeciphera ble]
 Jew, and I just didn™t 
believe her, you know. I always thought ther
e Œ I thought this old par Œ Polish Jews 
were Œ there were no Jews
 anyplace else but in 
Poland
. Especially then, when I went 
to school, we are no longer Œ we are aske
d never to call them Jews, but Poles of 
Mosaic confession Œ or persuasion, pardon
 me. Because my  te Œ now my  teacher 
said, this word Jews is 
a word that came from 
Russia
 and it was an insulting word. 
And that™s where you to Œ when  we Œ we 
shouldn™t be using it.
 And Œ but then, you 
know how when you sa ys Pole of a Mosaic
 
persuasion, how long that is, your 
mouth, you Œ to say she is 
Œ and we never said she is Jewish. I don™t know, maybe 
we did. No 
[indecipherable] 
and we always says in the Jewish she or he, because in 
Polish that™s possible. And anyhow, that™s
 how I was brought up. You know, even 
today when I do the translations for the Re
d Cross and it says of nationality Polish, 
and religion, I always say
 
Mosaic, because I Œ I had to  Œ and they  always would put 
Œ tho-those who correct those things said 
Jewish, and I said no, so  I wrote j Œ the 
Polish Red Cross and I said, now what is 
it? Because wh en I went to school, in 
[indecipherable]
 documents, it said confession, it says either Roman Catholic or 
Evangelic or whatever, or Mosaic. I mean, 
there was no such a thing like Jewish. So 
Œ and besides I say to this lady in th
e Red Cross, that™s an insult. And 

[indecipherable]
 Jews used an insulting words wh
ere it™s possible, you know. And Œ 
because they  didn™t know any different. Bu
t anyhow, so th at™s how Œ if you have

friends Œ and this also played
 Œ how to say, not Œ I don™t 
know, of course, in Œ in  the 
gymnasium too, we had girls who were
 Jewish, and one of my  Œ I was one 
Ev a
, and 
the other one al Œ 
Eva Kliseberg
(ph). But then we were in
 Œ we used a bad Polish Œ 
well we Œ if we wanted to insu lt her, if  somebody wanted to
 insult anyone whose 
name end in 
erg
, like 
Kliseberg
(ph) or
 Oberberg
(ph) or something, well in Polish 
there, to indicate a young girl, a daughter 
of somebody, you end 
Œ you put the ending 
uvna
 to indicate that she is an unmarried yo
ung girl. Now, but if
 your name ends in
 
G, [indecipherable] 
and you end and 
you add this 
uvna
, that gives you a word for 
human waste. And so the teacher would 
say, my goodness gracious, we Œ you™re 
supposed  to say po Œ in  Po lish, the Œ the
 gare
(ph) changes to 
jer
(ph). And she 
[indecipherable]
 and all that kind of stuff and 
how she was a movie star, theater 
star. She played with 
Martha Eggert
(ph) and this Polish singer, forgot his name. 
But anyhow she was a beautiful girl, I 
[indecipherable]
 Polish officer who was an 
invalid, he left his Œ lost his leg during th
e war. And I will never see such a beautiful 
girl, and we were so jealous of her mother
 because her mo ther was always assisting 
her, comes to class, picks her up and a
ll this. And the jealousy is a long-lived 
sentiment, you know. But anyh
ow Œ but, I mean, she survive 
Auschwitz
 and she 
lives in 
Szczecin
, or 
Stettin
 and she is in the theater and we correspond and 
[indecipherable]
. And one time we had th e school 
ball and the Œ both of us were 
chosen queen, as a Œ were a little crown on
 the Œ and sh e didn™t even know. And Œ 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure

and Œ and I said we just look at the sc
hool picture and you see you got something on 
your head . And I don™t know 
how the teacher did it, but 
they give us two crowns, 
one for her and one for me. But she was a 
gorgeous little girl, and she probably still 
is. And of course the girls Œ and the only 
time that I saw her during the war was on 
the street. And she is working 
together with the other ones
 to wo rk on the Œ to clean 
the streets of snow. And when I saw her I 
couldn™t believe it. I said, what are you 
doing here? And she says, go aw ay because th ey
 gonna take you, too. So  I ran away. 
That was the only time that I saw her 
during the war, before she went to 
Auschwit z
. 
But she survived. I co
uldn™t imagine she wouldn™t, 
you know, with her luck and 
beautiful looks. And she was a good Œ she coul
d have very easily 
said, because Œ that 
she was not Jewish, cause you can™t prove
 it. But then  you could be denounced  
sometimes and that was even worse. 
Q: Were you a very athletic, strong child? 

A: Oh no, I was very anemic and I know th
at because I couldn™t get to write Œ th-the 
Polish or European one has 
a little hook, an d I never knew whether the hook was on 
the right, the left. Anyhow, I couldn™t make a very nice one, and th e teacher always 

complained, this Madame 
[indecipherable]
. And she said, why can™t you write a 
one as beautifully as you write a two? Beca
use the two has those curly-curlies and I 
kind of like them, but the one, it was just 
too sharp for me. And I Œ and I say, w-will 
I live to the year 2000? And 
she said Œ she looked at me and sh e says, you? And Œ 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure

cause I was small, anemic and thin and she 
looks at me, says oh child, no, no. None 
of us will live to the year 2000. But then she says, why? Why do 
you want to live to 
the year 2000? I said, well because you 
always praise my 
two and you always 
complain about Œ I didn™t sa
y complain, I don™t rememberwhat exactly I said Œ or 
because you love Œ you like my
 two and you don™t like my one. So if Œ if it was the 
year 2000, I always get a praise for you. 
And that™s Œ and I was 
a thin, and then I Œ 
very anemic, had to drink this horrible fi
sh liver oil and all that. You never Œ your 
children Œ I mean, this the ge Œ your genera
tion didn™t have to 
suffer from this fish 
liver oil, but we did. I sold it too, I Œ 
I paid my cousin, one of the cousins I was 
living with to drink it for me. We put it fi
rst in the flower pots, but then we Œ 
everybody knew there was a fish 
odor in the flower plants, but he loved it, so he was 
just gulping it. I think I paid him 
like a cent or something like that.  
Q: Did you like to read, did 
you have other interests? 
A: Oh yeah, I was an avid 
reader, I always get prizes 
for readingnicely and read ing 
many books. And I used to misb
ehave to be able 
to stay after school, and the teacher 
always would work in the library. And one 
day she says to me, now what is it with 
you? Why do you Œ because that
 was a Œ for her it was a pain
 in the neck to have to 
have this Œ watch this kid in the library 
all the time. And I said well, because I can 
read books. And she says, what? You can 
get all the books you 
want and you don™t 
ha Œ and I don™t have to
 be here with you. And besides 
that, I returned to that village

where I lived in the country wh
en I was little and I had a c
ousin there. Well, actually, 
it was really a son of Œ of Œ of th at aunt 
that brought me up. And he went to some 
kind of photograph school or 
something like that and here™s
 this big box with  books. 
And I looked in this Œ in this
 Œ one time he forgot to lock 
it, so I Œ I looked at Œ in, 
there was this one book about legends or so
mething and I started reading it. And I so 
loved it that I went through many book
s, which I can understand anyhow. But 
anyhow, ever since then I loved reading. I 
learned that you can have the whole world 
to yourself when 
you read books. 
Q: What languages did you speak? Ju Œ mo re than Po lish? 
A: Well, in Œ at that time I only spoke Polish. And Œ 
Q: Then after elementary 
school you went on to Œ 
A: To the gymnasium 
[indecipherable]
 had to choose, and yo
u could either take Œ 
we Œ we had to have Latin, but you could ch
oose either French 
or German, but that 
was this time when the Œ and 
my  father said, you have to 
know th e language of your 
enemy, so I would suggest you take German
. And I said no-nothing to it, I™ll never 
take any German. 
Q: What Œ what did you
 know about German and 
Germ any
? 
A: Well, let™s see now, that was the year 
Œ see, there was already from 30 Œ what I 
knew it™s from that atheistic uncle, he read the 
ﬁMein Ka mp fﬂ
 and he wa Œ had to Œ 
and he was in the business of foreign ex chan
ge. And of course wh en you™re in that

busin ess you have lots of Jewish clientel
e. And he was telling them, you know, that 
if he Œ if Œ if they know what™s good for 
them, they would emigrate. And they said 
oh, what does this dumb Pola
ck knows, you know, and all 
that kind of stuff. They 
wouldn™t listen. And then I remember that
 during the war one of them, because he 
saved some of them, he said, gosh, how ba
 Œ how dumb were we that we didn™t 
listen to you. Because they had the mone
y, they could have
 gone away. But Œ 
Q: What was your uncle™s name? 
A: 
Jakub
(ph). Very nice Christian name, too. 
Jakub Seftrik
(ph). And he was a Œ he 
was the fellow who during the war ask me Œ 
my  mo ther was very Œ I™d say Œ I don™t 
want to say bad wo rd s about her, but I woul
d say she spent half a day she Œ oh Œ in 
prayer, okay 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: So sh e was a very religious woman? 
A: Yeah, but more than th at. I mean, she was overly re
ligious, you know, she paid 
for her childhood sins 
[indecipherable]
 maiden sins or whatever 
[indecipherable]
. 
But anyhow, since my uncle, who Œ he ask 
us Œ he ask me Œ es
 Œ he kind of asked 
me things that I thought were kind of 
funny. And he says, 
do you think you would 
have room for an old lady in your hous
e? And I said, my  mo ther can ope Œ for 
money my  mo ther Œ for rent 
my mother can always find 
a room. So th ey made up Œ 
what it really was, it was the family of this
 lady left, and they left this Jewish old 
lady alone with the cook. And so, my  uncle
 made out that this lady was a nanny

whom the Jews left, and Œ and sh
e was old and that™s why this 
[indecipherable]
 the 
cook was taking care of her. Which in reality
 she was not. But the trouble with this Œ 
so we took her in Œ other Œ my  mo ther 
took her in, no-not knowing who she was. 
And I swore that I would never tell. And so in  this 
[indecipherable]
 I was bringing 
food and feeding and what kind of st
uff. And I don™t know what Œ she died 
peacefully, because I was taken to 
Germany
, so I never went to the funeral or 
anything like that. But anyhow, 
she died peacefully in her 
bed. But the thing was that 
she had to  look Catholic, so I went to the Œ well, and the pri Œ th Œ my uncle says, 
you have to buy her a rosary, cause all 
old Polish woman had the ro sary, you know. 

And you have to teach her some prayers, 
so that she, you know  Œ the trouble with 
her was that she was already a little deaf. 
And teaching her wasn™t very easy. So I 
have Œ I beny Œ I 
belong to the sodality, you 
know, as a servants of 
Mary
, and I had 
a couple girlfriends 
[indecipherable]
 kind of change, and by the time we™re Œ well, 

she finally learned how to say 
Halle
(ph)
 Ma ry
, and wh at™s this other one. No  
[indecipherable]
 I don™t even know how you say th
at in English. But anyhow, there 
are two pray ers that you have to say for 
the ro sary, and then you have to say the 
ﬁ
Our Father,ﬂ [indecipherable]
 the 
ﬁOur Father.ﬂ 
But anyhow Œ but she finally 
got it and all she did was sitting on this bed 
with this rosary in her hand and saying 
this rosary all the time. And Œ but I was 
Œ I was okay. But she never talked mu ch 
about Jewishness, because she was 
one of those Gentile Œ I mean, 
Polandized

Jewish, you know. And besides, she was dea
f, so when you had to
 talk to her, you 
had to sh out and you really couldn™t 
get any Œ she would say, huh? What? 
Q: Whe-Wh en did you first st
art hearing about a man named 
Hitler
? 
A: Oh, it must have been in 
30 Œ ™33 or I Œ no, it mu st ha
ve been ™3 3 wh
en  my  un cle 
got this 
ﬁMein Kampf,ﬂ
 cause they were selling it in Œ so it mu st have been in 30 Œ 
before ™33. 
Q: And what did he mean to you, what did 
Hitler
 mean to you when you were 
young? 

A: Well, my uncle always said that he wasn™t Œ he was a tyrant and he was 

dangerous, that™s all he was always saying,
 but he didn™t explain the book to me and 
all anything like that. But he says
 that this man means trouble for 
Poland
, that™s 
what he said. And our f Œ now tho Œ in thos
e days he didn™t mean much to me and 
except that that™s why I didn™t want to  learn any German because that had a 

connections with him and my father said
 you Œ you learn the 
language of your 
enemy. And so Œ but anyhow I didn™t take
 German, I took French , and I didn™t Œ

Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure  
February 2, 2001 

 

 
 
21
A: No, I took French and I didn™t learn Ge
rman til the war started. And when all the 
Poles of German heritage didn™t want to sign up th e 
volkes
(ph) list, so they were all 
kicked out from wh
at they call the 
vartigal
(ph) and they had Œ 
they had to leave 
their homes with nothing on 
them, but they had one thin
g, they sp oke German. And 
the way for them to make a living was 
to give German lessons. And so then 
everybody wanted to
 help them, and 
[indecipherable]
 then I realized that my father 
was right. So I took the lessons from someon
e, a lady, and th en Œ then there were no 
more Polish schools, so there were all Œ 
people were trying to  get some kind of 
schooling fo r their children. And because in 
Kraków
 there are lots of Poles of 
German descent, or Austrian descent, so th
ey Œ they  said, you ca
n™t just leave those 
children out of two Œ two cla
sses of high school. We have 
to have something else. So 
they had some kind of petition and they ch
ange, because the academic high schools 
were all over, they were all finished, but 
they Œ they turned Œ they started a new 
school for kindergarten teachers. And so 
we went to school 
underground for normal 
classes to continue our high school, but 
on top we were doing 
all this getting ready 
to be kindergarten teachers. 
Q: Before we talk about that
, let™s just talk a little bit 
about Œ more about befo re Œ 
the time before the war started. B efore 1
939, before September ™39, did you notice 
any different treatment of 
the Jews in your town? 

A: Well, let me see. 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure

22
Q: Before the Germans came. 
A: Before the Germans. 

Q: Or did life go on normally? 
A: Yeah, life Œ for me went on normally be
cause I went to the sa
me Œ  with  th e same 
people, I knew those same girls. And pers
onally, I didn™t. I lived in a Œ how shall I 
say it, you know, a place where Œ I-I didn™
t Œ I mean, I w as never there where 
probably the action was, and there were
n™t any new index and index was the Œ 
there™s this Œ th-they call this national 
[indecipherable]
 and all that kind of stuff. 
But I never associated with them or anyt
hing like that, so I really didn™t notice it. 
And Œ 

Q: So until September ™39, lif
e was going along normally? 
A: Very normally for me and fo r my Jewish friends, too. But Œ 
Q: And then  wh at was your f Œ wh en Œ wh at
 Œ what was the first ch ange or the first 
sight of German soldiers? What 
Œ what do you first remember? 
A: Well, I first remember Œ well, the first 
re Œ memo ries is on the big marketplace, 
the Germans came in and set up their tents,
 th e soldiers then started shaving and 
washing and all that kind of stuff. So
 Kraków 
was left alone beca
use they thought 
it™s Œ you know, they Œ it™s a beautiful c
ity and they wanted it as probably their 
capitol. They didn™t even steal the golde
n domes from the churches. And so I Œ I 
only saw the regular young men washed and 
shave and all that kind of stuff. And a

bunch of my  Jewish boys who were talk
ing to them and asking them question 
because they were Œ you kno
w, they were Œ they were
 the ones who knew German. 
And we™re Œ so if we wanted to know so
mething, we say ask him why this and all 
that sort of thing. But there was no te
rror, there was no Œ terror started when the 
einsatz Œ
 wh-when Œ after the 
soldiers came, the 
Einsatztruppen
(ph), that™s when 
all those things started. And that™s what
 is big about the difference between the 
Roman Catholic Poles and the Mosaic Poles 
started to blew up, and the big signs on 
the kiosks came that all Jews have to report 
and that no Pole is 
allowed to work for a 
Jew or any Jewish store, or in the Jewi
sh household. And la
ter on that any Pole 
caught helping a Jew or giving him food or sh
elter would be shot and all that kind of 
stuff. So people started being afraid. 

Q: What was your Œ I mean, you were youn
g, you were 15 - 16 years old. What Œ
what Œ what was your reaction, as a teenager? 

A: I just Œ I Œ I just really 
couldn™t believe that people of 
Schiller
 and 
Guta
(ph) 
could do anything like that. I mean, that was 
my  reaction. And I just couldn™t believe 
it, til the first person Œ first persons that 
were punished was th
e Polish intelligentsia. 
In our house there was dot Œ a dentist™s s
on Œ I mean there was a son of a lady who 
was dentist. And another one was Œ 
Q: You lived  in an ap artment house? 

A: Yeah.  

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure  
February 2, 2001 

 

 
 
24
Q: And then  the other lady™s son was a medi
cal student, and then  another Œ it was the 
three people whose sons went to 
Auschwitz
. So we knew wh at was going on in a 
sense that we always met at this tailor 
[indecipherable]
 you know 
[indeciphera ble]
 
tailor, and that was usually the place where ev
erybody went to for 
gossip and all that 
kind of stuff. And so  that was where we met and sh e was telling us about 
Auschwitz
, but she just used to make a packag
e for her son and we all would give 
her something to Œ to put it in
 a package and all that. And Œ 
Q: These are Polish Christians who were sent to 
Auschwitz
? 
A: Polish Christians, yeah. And then this 
other lady Œ well, anyh
ow, we all kind of 
met at this tailor™s and these ladies were tellin g us about 
Auschwitz
 and about their 
sons and we could never un
derstand how a dentist Œ why 
a dentist would end up Œ in 
those days we had absolutely no idea that 
they idea was to kill 
the intelligentsia and 
leave the old, poor folks alone so they ca
n do with them what
 they  want. And so 
those three men Œ so we knew ab out 
Auschwitz
. But up un Œ we had no id ea what™s 
Œ why. A-And you just keep
 asking yourself. And Œ but 
that™s Œ but I knew about 
Auschwitz
 immediately wh at Œ because the first 
day, that first day that they Œ war 
was over, they started rounding up Polish in
telligentsia and shipping them off. And 
the teachers too, and they didn™t make Œ 
Q: The first day the 
war began, you mean? 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure  
February 2, 2001 

 

 
 
25
A: No, th-the first day the war was ended.
 I mean, the Polish campaign didn™t last 
very long. 
Q: Oh, oh-oh that, I see what you mean. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: I thought you meant World War II. 

A: No, no, no, no, no, th
e Polish campaign, okay? 
Q: Right. 
A: And that™s where the horrors really star
ted. And at first they really Œ although 
somebody said, one of the ladi
es, oh yeah, her son was a t
eacher and she says no, she 
told the dentist™s mother, the 
first o n e to go are the teachers. And they didn™t give a 

darn whether the teacher was a Jew or Pole
, as long as he was a teacher, they just 
wanted to  do away with the people who 
can stand against them or start trouble or 
anything like that. So because
 they were on a list of Œ of Œ I don™t know, I heard it 
someplace, a list of teachers that are arre
sted, and it didn™t make
 any difference who 
they were, whether they were
 Catholic or Jews, a Mosa
ic, pardon me. My teacher 
wouldn™t like that. And anyhow, th
at™s where the Œ 
then when the 
Einsa tztrup
(ph) Œ 
then there all you see is the Jews in the wi
nter, because Œ having to clean the streets 
and do all kind of stuff like that, and you co
uldn™t go into a Jewish store and th ey  
were all clo sed. Or what the Jew Œ suppose 
that you Œ a Jewish store di Œ sometimes 
they make some kind of contract with th
eir workers, or their salespeople and so 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure

26
sometimes they were given the Œ selling th
e business or something like that. I mean, 
there was all kinds of deals that were done just to Œ 
Q: Did you talk things over with
 your mo th er and stepfath er Œ 
A: No, no Œ 

Q: Œ about what was happening? 

A: No, never. We were kind of
 sheltered, you know, in  a way. I knew  about what 

was happening, because my  uncles said, if
 you didn™t Œ if this lady Œ if you don™t 
take this lady sh e Œ she w
ill die. So I knew that Œ 

Q: And why did you do Œ I mean, that was 
very brave of you as a teenager. Why did 
you do th is? 
A: Well, after all, I was a sodality and I 
was supposed to be do
ing good deeds. So, 
besides I did a favor for my  uncle. And anothe
r thing, I used to steal apples from this 
lady™s ya Œ orchard. I mean, not steal, but 
Œ well, yes. This family had a beau tiful 
villa and they had these gorgeous pears. 
And anyhow, I feel like it w as doing for 

atonement 
[indecipherable]
 know about the pears tha Œ and apples I stole from her 
garden. 
Q: What was the elder Œ 
A: I don™t know the name. 
Q: Œ elderly Jewish 
lady™s name, do you Œ 
A: I don™t know because I Œ when I 
was little I didn™t know the name Œ 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure  
February 2, 2001 

 

 
 
27
Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ and my uncle said no names Œ 

Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ because if you didn™t know her name
, you couldn™t betray anybody. You would 
say, I don™t know her. 
Q: Were you aware of the dang
er of wh at you were doing? 
A: No, I wasn™t, it was an adventure. Same
 thing like I was Œ and I just don™t know, 
mu st have been that uncle of mine, becaus
e I was asked to Œ to meet somebody Œ oh, 

in 
Kraków
 there™s a street that™s n o
thing but booksellers, called 
Spitana
(ph). And 
there were lots of Œ a very many of the b
ooksellers were antique Œ it was called antiq 
Œ 
Q: Antiquarian. 

A: Antiquarians who were ve
ry famous, they had Œ so I know th at one day I was 
approached to Œ I don™t know, th ey were fe
 Œ my  uncle says, you know, I have a job 
for you. And I say, yeah, what kind, you 
know, cause he always need jobs for me. 
And he says, I want you to meet someb
ody. And so I met this gentleman, this 
sukanice
(ph) and he says, I-I need you do me
 a favor, to take this package and 
deliver it to the ghetto. And it 
turned out it was gold. And I 
don™t know, to this day I 
cannot understand how they trus
ted me with this gold. Bu t it Œ what you had to do is 
you went on that streetcar, then you had 
to jump  off and get 
into the ghetto. And 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure  
February 2, 2001 

 

 
 
28
then, after all this trouble that I went thro
ugh, this old antiquarian says, child, you 
tell them Œ he gives his back to me and he 
says, just tell them that I™m too old. Tell 
them to give it to somebody
 younger. And I s Œ and so I went second time and they 
said, make sure that he takes it, and he ge
ts out. But they, of course in those days, 
because it was very easy to bribe somebody 
with gold, you know
, the guards and all 
that kind of stuff, it wasn™t that tight yet, it was just the first Œ 
they weren™t very well 
organized yet, but Œ so I went a couple mo re
 times to deliver it to somebody else, but 
Œ and I learned to jump off the streetcars so
 well that when I started going to school 
in 
F rankfurt 
in 
Germany
, instead of getting out on a st
ation behind the university, 
on the Œ when the tram went around I wo
uld jump  off and a policeman caught me 
and 
[indecipherable]
. And he says, my God, aren™t 
you afraid you™re gonna break 
your leg or something? I said, oh no
, I™ve got a good preparation for it. 
Q: Right. Before the ghet Œ 

A: It was an adventure, yeah. It wasn™t Œ be
sides, I did somebody 
a service, so that™s 
it. But it was most ma Œ m-mo
st and th at was, mo re than anything else it was the 
idea, can I do it? It was like attemptingmy luck, or tempting Œ trying to Œ 

Q: A challenge, you mean? 
A: Challenge yeah, it wa
s the challenge, really. 
Q: Before the ghetto was established, and 
we™ll get to that, did you see your Jewish 
friends? I mean, did you go to
 school with any of them? 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure  
February 2, 2001 

 

 
 
29
A: No, because all public schools we
re closed, there were no more. 
Q: Mm-hm. But you went to this sp
ecial school, did th -the Œ then Œ  
A: No, there were no more Jew Œ there were no more Jewish girls. 
Q: So what did the Jewish children do? 
A: I have no idea, that™s why I really am
 so sorry that I ne
ver Œ th ey  didn™t do 
anything. They went cleaning stre
ets or just sat home and Œ and 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: So you had no contact with them? 
A: No, because you couldn™t Œ because we 
moved from one Œ well, as long as I had a 
contact, I™ll be helping them 
little bit, or they could co
me, and I couldn™t understand 
why they had to wear this 
Œ this thing on th eir arm.  
Q: This yellow Œ 
A: Yellow, yeah. 

Q: Œ with the armband? 

A: No, armband, was a wide, with the da Œ Star of
 David. 
And Œ 
Q: What did you think of that? 

A: That was horrible, they were stupid wear
ing it. I mean, you kn
ow, we used to go 
in the country to do the black market, and 
there are usually some
 children to buy the 
stuff, so those children were Œ children 
could be Œ I mean, who would susp ect 
children having a big ch unk of
 bacon around, or somethi
ng like that? And there were 
these handsome, beautiful boys with blue ey
es and with this star. And I said, what 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure  
February 2, 2001 

 

 
 
30
the Œ why do you have to wear this thi
ng? All you have to 
do is take off your 
paysy
(ph) and Œ and Œ and nobody will know
 who you are. And 
they say oh, we 
cannot, because that™s Œ the rabbi said we
 cannot do it. And from that time on I never 
have any Œ how shall I say? Not confiden ce,
 but you know, I Œ dying for a religion is 
one thing, okay, but young people, young men who Œ oh, there were some 
[indecipherable]
 I mean, there™s no ques
tion about that, but thevery religious ones, 
under the pressure of their parents, they w
ould never do it. But still, there were some 
who did it, and Œ and run away
, and Œ this Œ that was difficult for boys, for girls it 
was nothing. 

Q: Right. 
A: I mean.  
Q: How did you know that the ghetto was be
ing established in Œ 
we™re talking about 
the ghetto in 
Kraków
. 
A: Ah yeah, because in
 the first place there was this 
big thing that no
 Œ no Pole can 
get into the ghetto, there™s gonna be a Œ 

Q: Big sign, you mean? 

A: Big sign, that™s it, there™s gonna be a ghe
tto and that no Jew can live outside of it, 
and ev ery Jew who lives on the outside has to
 come in. And of course in our street 
there Œ there were quite a few of them. And 
on the corner of my 
street it was this Œ 
oh yeah, that™s how I really kn
ow about this, becaus
e in the corner of our street, in a

house, there was this janitress, an d she to
ok in  a Jewish boy. Sh
e Œ one of the boys 
who lived in her house, and all the Œ some 
Poles said to her, w
hy do you keep this 
Jewish bastard in your house? And she said Œ why are you raising this Jewish 
bastard in your house? That™s about the an
ti-Semitism that I heard. And she said, I 
am not raising a bastard, I am raising my  
future son-in-law. And is Œ and then she 
says, if you say anything ab out it, I know ab
out every one of you something, that if 
you betray me, I do the same , I pay you back
. So  that nobody did.
 Now I really don™t 
know wh at happened , but somebody said th
ey did get married. But Œ but anyhow, I 
reme mb er like today, you know, somebody
 was saying something, do you know that 
she keeps the Jewish 
child? And to me that was nothi
ng, I mean, there were Jewish 
children all over. And Œ but she called bastard,
 and I say, that™s a not nice word to 
say. And she said, now reme mb er how I said , that™s not a bast Œ Jewish bastard, 

that™s my future son-in-law. So Œ 

Q: So th en the ghetto was established? 
A: Yeah. 
Q: And did you see Jews leaving th
eir homes to go into the ghetto? 
A: Not from my street. 
Q: What Œ what str
eet did you live on? 
A: That™s a Œ 
Slowacki
 alley. It™s really 
Natuvicza

the Three Poets, and my poet was

, so the beau tiful houses and all that. So 
the smart o n es already left, and the pru Œ 
I never seen any, to tell you the truth, 
houses of poor Jews. So  the ones like they had in 
[indecipherable]
 and all that kind 
of stuff. The only Œ the only poor Œ well, I re
ally didn™t see, b
ecause even the one Œ 
my  friends, they were all shop owners, so 
they had very  comfortable houses, and Œ 
Q: Did you say goodby
e to any of them?  
A: No. Because what happe
ned is that I moved from 
Dembiniki
(ph) to this other 
part of the city and 
by the time I went to 
Dembiniki
(ph) again, they were already 
gone. So  I couldn™t. And one of them, the 
Cohen
 girl, they ar Œ th ey Œ just the day 
before the war broke out, 
she le Œ they left for
 America
. And I was Œ and when she 
says, we™re going to  
America
, and I said, what for? And 
I had absolutely no idea, 
you know, I mean, I know that my  uncle said 
Hitler
 was a tyrant and all that kind of 
stuff and it™s bad luck  for 
Poland
, but I had no idea what 
they going to be doing. 
Then of course, with this lady is in 
Auschwitz
 and all this, but I had no Œ 
Q: Was your stepfather or father
 called up in the army previously? 
A: Oh yeah, he was a prisoner of war.  

Q: This is your stepfath er? 
A: Yeah, mm-hm, and he was a Œ yeah, he 
was a prisoner of war and then he was 
released and came home and was kind of ha
lf broken. My mo ther was always a bad 
feeling about it because Polish army was in di
ra Œ array, and so he Œ all of a sudden,

I think mu st have been September two or 
th ree, she says, what are you doing here? 
And he says, well, I can™t find my comp
any. And the next 
neighbor was a young 
woman whose hu-husband was a waiter, and 
she said, oh, this old man is coming 
home and my  poor husband has been take
n prisoner. And so my  m Œ or something 
like that. And so  my  mo ther says, go back
 and look fo r your co
mp any. And so he 
gets on this bicycle and he bicycled off 
to the front and got taken prisoners. So I 
think he felt guilty all the time, you know. 
She looked for him and she found him in 
some 
POW
 camp and make eye Œ made eyes at 
the German guards to let her drop 
stuff for him after Œ first th
ey looked what™s 
there, so there™ll be no weapons, 
anything like that. And then sh e cried, but 
she says why, he got this big package, it 
was like a bag, he distributed all the bread 
and the stuff, he gave them to the other 
prisoners. And she says, and I wo rked  the w
hole month to get this for him. But I Œ I 
said I couldn™t im Œ really  imagine that he would just eat it by himself while the 

others were hungry. 
Q: Was your father in the army? 
A: Yeah, he was in Œ 
intern Œ he went to 
Hun g a r y
 where the Polish army was 
destroy, he went with  
the other ones through 
Hungary
 and then from
 Hungary
 to 
France
, because at that time 
France
 was Œ and then wh en 
France
 fell, they were 
very lucky to have a ge

 France
 to 
Switzerland
 and they laid their 
arms at the Swiss border, and they were 
all in terned for the 
duration of the war. 
Q: What Œ let™s get back to
 the ghetto. What did it look 
like wh en you went inside? 
Can you describe it at all, 
some of the sights you saw? 
A: Well, at that time I didn™t
 see anything, I was so Œ I Œ really, I didn™t think mu ch. 
I do Œ I don™t remember much
, okay, because I was just 
looking for this certain 
house to meet this certain person. I no
ticed that it was cramped. That™s the 
impression that I have that Œ that here 
was a guy who owned this Œ this beautiful 
bookstore and all of a sudden  he has this 
one room with th ree or four other people. 
Q: How did you get into the ghetto
? What did you say to th e guard? 
A: I didn™t do anything, I jump  of
f the streetcar, and in the ghetto. 
Q: Oh, the streetcar went into the ghetto. 

A: Into the ghetto. And if you
™re at a certain point you ca
n jump  off and you were in 
the ghetto. And bi Œ children Œ I mean, I was ve
ry small, I really wa
s, at 14 years old, 
15. 

Q: But ordinarily y
ou could Œ I mean, if you hadn™t
 jumped off, it wouldn™t have 
stopped Œ 
A: You would have to go th r
ough a Œ yeah, yeah, I would ha
ve to go through a gate. 
But I didn™t have to go through 
a gate because I jumped off, 
so that I Œ there were Œ I 
didn™t see any guards. So the same way all 
the other boys who went
 outside or inside

got in th e streetcar or Œ and of course th
e Polish streetcar drivers knew that we were 
doing this, so they even 
slowed down a little bit. 
Q: So you went in seve
ral times to the ghetto? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Did you see any changes 
from one visit to the next? 
A: Just this Œ I was kind of scared a little b
it, okay, to begin with
. And then I went to 
different houses, but except for Œ it was not 
al Œ enou Œ enough time for them to get 
so hungry th at you co uld spot it. All you 
did Œ all I saw was ove
rcrowding. That Œ 
and that people just like Œ 

Q: Did other people try 
to give you messages? 
A: Oh yeah, but I Œ I Œ I would just Œ then
 they  are Œ wo uld deliver them on the other 
side, to the Œ 

Q: You did take the me Œ 

A: Œ same person. 
Q: Besides the messag e from the bookselle
r, did you ever take other messages? 
A: Oh yeah, but not Œ I never knew  any na
mes or who and all that. Ther-T here was 
just one poin t that they all would Œ you
 know, that gentleman, I don™t even know 
what he look like any more, it was an elde
rly gentleman. And I 
don™t know what you 
look like, but anyhow, bi Œ h-he Œ I would 
give it to him and he wo uld distribute it. 
But he never was on a col Œ o-on the envelo pe
, the name s and to whom it was, it was

always on the inside. So  Œ and th ey all 
had kind of funny name
s too, because one 
time I looked in one of those things, and th e names were like Œ 
Q: False names, you mean? 
A: False name
, Roosevelt
, and Œ in Polish, you know
, and all kinds of false 
[indecipherable]
 and all that kind of stuff.  
Q: So now you were in school? 
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: And then  wh at was the next change? 
A: Well, the next change was that they 
closed the school, th
ey Œ because they 
discovered that we were going
 underground. And some Œ we
ll, th-the Œ all there was 
[indecipherable]
 map of
 Poland
 or anything like that on the books or notebooks. 
And so lots of people didn™t see any us
e of tearing off the maps, cau se all Polish 
books Œ notebooks rather, had this po Œ map of 
Poland
 and th en something on one 
side wi Œ and so me historical dates on the 
others that the kids could rem Œ that was 
the way of teaching, too. And they did sa
y that it was forbidden. And I don™t know, 
one time came this German inspection and th
ey  found some kid with a Œ with  this 
maps and they said that™s it. So they cl
osed  this school. And then  Œ but then  the 
parents went again, you know, and after we
 finished this kindergarten thing, the 
parents were thinking, what else can we 
do? And then the Germ
ans needed people 
who spoke German to help them govern  
this new kingdom of theirs. And they 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure

37
needed  people to Œ to do th eir commercial 
things. So th ey opened this school, wi Œ it 
was called the preparatory school for Œ pr
ep aratory commercial school from higher 
preparatory school commerci Œ oh, it gos Œ 
an yhow, the name was so long th at it 
hardly got on the thing. But th
en that Œ we didn't finish that Œ yeah , so we did finish 
that, but before we finished this, came Ge
rmans into the school and pulled so me of 
us out, because they were looking for ch
ildren who were talented for languages. Is 
there any Œ and they  did that all over 
Kraków
 in many schools, so that who Œ 
because they needed this 
workforce and they
 needed somebody who knew Polish 
and German. And so th ey
 send me to a three 
[indecipherable]
 in the German school. 
It was like Œ like three months long, wher
e we learn German a
nd typewriting, typing 
and shorthand. So th at™s 
the next schooling I got. 
Q: And then  you stay
ed there how long? 
A: Law Œ I don™t know how lo
ng, was three months and I just got this paper, it was 
kind of orange thing and it said in work
, and that™s when I was called, maybe the 
next day. 
Q: To do what?  

A: To be s Œ go to a trans
it camp and then  go to a Œ to 
Germa ny
.  
Q: Oh, okay, so you fi
nished th is course. 
A: Course. 

Q: Of three months.

A: And I was to be working Œ oh yeah, an
d I was to be work in
g in a agricultural 
bank. 
Q: In 
Kraków
? 
A: In 
Kraków
. But this Œ the Gestapo needed wo
rk ers, and since I was one of the 
best students, they switched it and send me
 to this Gestapo school. No t Gestapo 
school but with this Œ to type fo
r this guy, for this Gestapo man. 
Q: This is still in
 Kraków
? 
A: This is still in 
Kraków
. But when I was in this German school, the man, the 
teacher was one of those ger Œ Germans w
ho would Œ cou Œ woul
d do away with all 
foreign words in German and just put all th
e Germanic words. So 
that when we were 
talking about comma, we called them 
bystreek
(ph). And when I went to take 
dictation for this Gestapo man, e-every time 
that he said comma, cause he was an old 
Austrian, every time he Œ he used th
e word comma, but it is written with a 
K
 in 
German, I wrote 
ko mma
. So  then  I typed it out and I gave it to him, you see? You 
can just imagine what this pi
ece looked  like. And so he Œ he looks at it and he says 

der Polisher
(ph) 
schweine
. And I just learn ed the word 
ferkel
, which means a lso a 
sw Œ literally a swine in German. And I say 
u-un
(ph)
 du bist in Pr-Preussischer 
ferkel
 
ond
(ph). You are a Prussian pig. And then Œ 
Q: You said that to him? 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure

39
A: Yeah, and I 
[indecipherable]
 idea, you know, wh at I was doing really, I just was 
offended that he called me a 
Polisher
(ph) swine. And Œ and I 
run out, and he got up 
and he run after me. B u t before that, we 
used to, before we had th is Jewish lady 
during th e war, we had a Ukrain ian law stud
ent living with us. And I met her right 
when  the war broke out and 
Poland
 lost and sh e says, now listen, you were so nice 
to me, so whenever you™re in trouble, you 
come to see me, because I will Œ I™m a big 
fish now at the German labor office in 
Kraków
. So if you need  any help Œ so  wh en I 
run out, I remember this girl and I runn
ed Œ and I run to  the Œ to Œ to th e 
arbeitsamt
 
and I told Œ told her what ha
ppened. I didn™t tell her how I called him, but I said I got 
in trouble with him. And she says, don™t go
 home, go to one of your friends. Can you 
think of a friend wh en I can 
contact you? And I said Œ I give her a name of a girl. 
Unfortunately, this girl lived
 by the railroad station, the street Œ you want to stop?

Beginning Tape Two, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of the 
United Sta tes 
Holocaust Memorial Museum 
volunteer collection interview with
 Kristina Belfoure
, and this is tape number two, 
side 
A
, and you were talking ab out how you we
nt to your friend, the Ukrainian law 
student who was going 
to help  you out.  
A: And so I w Œ and she said, now don™
t go, and sh e s Œ so I went to this 
[indecipherable]
 street, which is right by the railroa
d station, that™s the transit route 
to the Œ every Po lish village and town had 
to  deliver a certain amount of people fo r 
work  to 
Germany
. And so there was columns of sl
ave work Œ future slave workers 
going by that street, and they
 always counted them before
 they entered the railroad 
station, and if there were some missing, th
ey would close off one of the streets and 
caught anybody Œ catch anybo
dy who didn™t have a papers
. And I don™t know how I 
didn™t have that little paper with me. 

Q: Y-You had papers, but you just
 didn™t have them that day? 
A: That day, yeah. And Œ and you could 
not be on the street without a working 
paper. I mean, i-if you were, that™s Œ and you got caught, that™s it, cause they were 

after getting as many people as possible for work  to 
Germany
, because they needed 
labor. And so this 
Nina
 went to my  parents and my  
parents said she didn™t come 
home, she went to this girl. And she said
, no, she never got he
re. So she Œ because 
she knew the Œ how this all works, and she 
went to the transit camp. And I saw her 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure

and she fixed so up that I would go to  a tobacco factory in 
Germany
, that was easy 
work . And that™s how I got to this factory in 
Germany
 called
 Hanewacker,
 which 
was making chewing tobacco. 
Q: So we were talk
ing about early 1942? 
A: Uh-huh, January 
[indeciphera ble]
 
Q: January 1942.  
A: I don™t re Œ quite rememb er what Œ wh ether it was January  or February , but it was 
Œ 
Q: And you were 17 and a half? 

A: Yeah. 
Q: An-A nd what was your reaction when  th
ey told you you couldn™t Œ they were 
going to  take you aw ay? You co uldn™t even  go home. 
A: No, I didn™t go home, and 
Œ and I didn™t Œ no, I didn™t go home, because I was 
caught wh ile I was going to  my  girlfriend™s and th at nobody really knew wh at 
happened to me except fo
r this woman, this lawyer who knew wh ere I could 
possibly be, if I got caught. 
Q: Right, right. 
A: And so she just was so 
wonderful that she gave me this easy job. Or she could 
have just let me Œ  
Q: Could you co mmunicate with
 your Œ with your family? 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure

42
A: No, no, not Œ I Œ they got a note from 
me when Œ when I was really in Œ in 
Hanewacker
 in 
Germany
. 
Q: What Œ what was your emotional state 
at that point? Were you very frightened? 
A: Oh yeah, I was frig h tened, but in a 
way it was an adventure and I knew German. 
So I knew I™m gonna get through w
ith this. I mean, 
I™m gonna getmy 
[indecipherable] 
out somehow, okay. 
Q: You were leaving 
Poland
 to go to 
Germany Œ 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Œ did Œ but what did 
Poland Œ 
A: Oh yeah, and another thing that happene
d to me was in that transit camp they 
were cutting everybody™s hair off, and I ha
d pigtails. And I don™t know why they 
didn™t cut my off. This lady Œ but I heard 
of something whisper, 
you know, and the Œ 
maybe she just took pity on me, and sh e didn™t 
shore 
my  h e ad . 
Q: Did you look old? 
A: No, I was like a child, I 
looked like a ch
ild, okay, so maybe that™s why Œ I think 
that™s maybe why they took
 pity on me, I imagine. 
Q: But what were your thou
ghts about having to leave 
Poland
? I mean, you felt very 
proud of being a Po le. 
A: Of course I felt proud and I was scared
, I mean yeah, cause I didn™t know what I 
was going. But on the other hand, this Œ th
is lady said Œ oh, oh 
yeah, I™ll tell you why 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure  
February 2, 2001 

 

 
 
43
I wasn™t scared, because after 
Poland
 and 
Germa ny
 had this pact of non-aggression, 
Polish textbooks in school didn™t picture 
Germany
 as a horrible place. When you 
open a Œ and my  cousin studied  German, okay, so they  had thos
e Œ those books and 
you had just beautiful palaces and Œ and si
ghts and all this. I m
ean, they Œ for some 
reason they did not Œ th ey ch anged a Œ they
 changed th e way of teaching, and they 
were not stressing the horrible ta Œ thing that it Œ Prussians did to 
Poland
 before. All 
they was talking was beautiful 
Alps
, beautiful 
Bavaria
, beautiful 
Rhine 
river. And 
you can see this 
Rhine
 river and th e castles around it and this whole 
[indecipherable]
. And so I really Œ how shall I say?
 I say, well finally I™m gonna see 
those things. Was ka Œ I had no idea that 
I™ll never get out of a camp, but I mean, it 
was a slave labor camp and you 
Œ well, there was no way of 
[indecipherable]
 if we 
were Œ but that™s early on. 
But anyhow, I was Œ you know, I went away, it was li ke 
adventure. I didn™t expect what was comi
ng and god Œ thanks G
od, you know. I had 
no id ea. 
Q: Did you know anybody else
 in the group that you were
 in at this transit camp ? 
A: No, nobody. 
Q: So you were totally alone in it? 
A: I was to-totally alone, but then immediat
ely the first thing they did is, did this 
delousing, and you going with 
this hot bath , it almo st burne
d you and all this kind of 
stuff, and already there you 
started looking for somebody 
you may like, to talk and

say what™s going to  happen to us, and th
is and that. Then 
somebody said, well 
nothing™s going to happen, 
we™re gonna go to work to
 Germa ny
. And th en Œ 
Q: Now this transit camp is in 
Kraków? 
A: 
Kraków
. 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: And whenever you™re in a situ ation like 
that you always look for somebody that 
you can hook up to Œ to  Œ to have some ki
nd of support or some
thing, you know, and 
so Œ 

Q: And the Œ the people were 
all P o lish Christians, no Jews. 
A: Yeah, no Jews. I Œ I don™t know who th
ey were, but then anyhow, I bet you they 
had a selection later on. But 
Œ but I wa Œ didn™t witness it. And then th e girls Œ 
Q: Where Œ where was the transit 
clamp
 lo cated, do you know? 
A: Gee, I have no idea where it was. 

Q: Okay . 
A: It™s too far back Œ 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ to Œ to remember. 
Q: And so th en what happened? 
A: Noth ing. I was all of a sudden Œ first we
 were in the regular trains. No, I don™t 
know. No, first we were in a kind of cattle
 trains and then they changed to regular

45
trains the minute we left 
Germany
 Œ 
Poland
, and I was so disappointed with this 
Germany
, you know, it was Œ is dirty 
and the snow is dark and all this kind of stuff, 
you know. I always think ab out 
those books with this beautiful sight, and here is this 
Œ I mean, because I was to 
Silesia,
 you see, so which th at™s
 all industrial region, you 
don™t see a village or anything like that. A
nd I said, wow. So, and finally we get to 
this 
Hanewa cker
 and to this station, and they st
arted being very  nice to us. Tow Œ 
toward civilians, whenever there were Germ
an civilians present,
 they changed their 
attitude, too, cause they didn™t want the Œ I 
Œ I imagine they didn't
 want the civilians 
to know what they were really doing w
ith people. And especially Œ probably too 
because we were all 
very young, and oh Œ 
Q: Was this men and wo men? 
A: No, just women. And Œ really young 
girls. And it was night, and we got off, 
carried all our bundles, and they  didn™t say 
raus
 like they usually said, you sh  Œ they 
said 
ausweichen
, which means, you know, get out, bu
t not in a very Œ in a nasty 
way. And we just walk and wa
lk and walk and th en we a
rrive at this factory. Oh 
yeah, and then we Œ they let us in and it 
was lights, it was like oh, thanks God, cause 
we were already hungry and thirsty. And 
we went to this room tha Œ it was like a 
cafeteria or a dining room or somethin
g like that. And that™s when I knew about 

what™s happening to the Jews, because when
 I got there Œ when we got there, there 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure

was a group of girls with yellow covers on
 their head, what do 
you call those thing? 
If you have to wear it, like Œ 
Q: Kerchief? 
A: No, not a kerchief. 
Q: A bandana. 

A: Not a bandana, like a doctor™s
 wear, what do they wear? 
Q: Oh, a Œ a cap, a se Œ 
A: Cap, something like that, and they 
had yellow caps. White
 smocks and yellow 
caps. And you know, I was inqui
sitive, so I wanted to  s Œ 
they were like giving up 
their dishes, getting ready to go, as they we
nt by this thing and so me of them Œ every 
one of them that I watch were putting away 
th e dishes. And I want
ed to go to them 
cause I wanted to find out well, what is th
is place like? And th
e guard says no, no, 
verboten
, those are Jews. And I Œ when  d Œ he sa
id Jews, Jewish girls, I said well, 
that™s good, then I can™t Œ and so  I went to
 them, I mean when he
 turn ed around, and 
I started talking Polish. 
[indecipherable]
 And they Œ  
Q: They didn™t answ er? 
A: They didn™t answ er, and finally they 
called somebody, here comes this lady and 
says in Polish Œ she also has this yello
w thing on her head . And she says, what do 
you want from them? And I say, how come 
they don™t speak any Polish if they™re 
Jews? And she says, because 
they are Jewish girls from 
Vienna
 and they don™t know 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure

47
any Polish. That wa
s an  ey e op ener. 
[indecipherable] 
was right there, there are other 
Jews that are not Po lish. And sa Œ and I am 
Œ I say, oh Œ she says Œ I say, what™s with 
the Œ what are they so afraid of? Becaus
e you came and you™re gonna be replacing 
them and they™re going to
 Pola nd
. And I said, well they would love it here, I mean 
Pola nd . 
There™s so ma ny Jews in 
Poland
. My hometown every fifth person is a Jew. 
And she looks at me, you kn
ow, like that, and says child
, child, they™re not going Œ 
they™re going probab ly to die 
there. I just co uldn™t believe it, you know, I said why? 
People who follow ev ery blessed God™s commandment and there™s a hundred s of 
them. How? I mean, I just couldn™t believe 
it. But I met her coup
le of days after, 
because they were the ones wh
o were dishing out the food, 
you know. So I say, have 
you heard from your friends? An d she 
said no, they were someplace in
 Poland
, so 
they probably died
. But that was the first time that 
I knew of the fate of the Polish 
Jews Œ not Polish Jews, but I mean Jews. An
d I got a history lesson th-that isn™t such 
a n-not all Poles of Mosaic 
faith don™t speak Polish. And 
so that was an eye opener, 
really an eye opener. Cause you have to
 imagine, I was inquisitive and I say 
[indecipherable]
. And Œ but they  looked at us, be
cause we™re skinny an -and they 
were going out. And they knew that the minut
e we come, they™ll be gone. And here I 
telling about all this, how they love Jews in 
Poland
 and how they ™re gonna lo ve it, 
that every fifth person is a Jew. I mean Œ 
I mean, I have ta Œ 
absolutely no idea. I 
don™t know whether I was dumb or 
naïve, or Œ or Œ or I just
 lived in another world or

s Œ what. But it Œ it was an eye opener. 
And the first shocking news about the 
destruction of Jewry. That was the first tim
e that I really Œ and this lady whenever 
she saw me , cause she was like 
a leader of those gir Œ Viennese girls, you know, she 
just always look at me like that, 
you know, and what could I tell her? 
Q: Sh-S he was a Jewish woman? 
A: Oh yeah, she was a Jewish woman. 

Q: But she stayed. 
A: Well, th Œ she left too, later, but not too 
long after that. After the last girls left, she 
left too. She gave me a lesson. She r
eally opened my  Œ you know, when  you™re 
young and you™re sheltered by 
parents, they Œ you don™t really realize what™s going 
on because you have th Œ all 
those childish things in y
our mind and bo
yfriends and 
this and that and books, and you don™t really
 take part in what™s going on. And that 
was the first lesson that I got. And then of
 course in that factory there are Œ the 
second time that I really at Œ felt guilty. 
First time I felt guilty th at I didn™t do 
something for this 
Eva Kriseberg
(ph), because my  uncle could have pulled her out. 
And I didn™t get in touch with her and I don
™t know ju st why I didn™t get in touch 
with her, just because she 
scare me, she says, go away, 
go away. And th Œ and she 
says, we don™t live in our Œ I say wh ere are your parents, where do you live? She 

says, we don™t live in this pla Œ in our pl
ace any more. We lived
 in this compound. 
And so I felt so gu
ilty then, in this 
Hanewa cker 
comes this big mass Œ big

supervisor and co uple Gestapo men, and 
come to this girl. And he calls her 
something like Miss
 Ring elba um
(ph) or something like that. And she says, oh, I™m 
not 
Ringelbaum
(ph), I™m 
Kratkauska
(ph), and he says ye
ah, we know who you 
are. And they took her. Because there were
 Œ you know, it™s easy for a Jewish girl 
that looks Œ doesn™t look Œ I just Œ I re
ally don™t know what that means to look 

Jewish, to tell you th e truth. It always 
baffled me, how you can tell, you know. Bu t 
because I lived together, I just didn™t see 
any difference. And they have taken her 
and I felt so helpless. Just the day that I saw
 Eva
 going with this 
broom thro ugh the 
snow, I me an, this was Œ just nothing you ca
n do, cause there™s always some soldiers 

behind you. 
Q: This was a Jewish girl wh
o was passing as a Polish girl? 
A: Is a Jewish girl passing as a Polish gi
rl, yeah. And somebody mu st have betray 
her or denounced  her. And then  somebody 
said, she™s not the only one. So  we knew 
there were other ones, but then Œ see, the id
ea was to act Catholic, say all the crosses 
and all this kind of stuff and Œ and say 
Jesus, Mary
 all the time. I mean, there was a 
way of Œ there was a way of
 keep ing Œ passing, but then
 sometimes Œ but if you 
came from a Hasidic home, you couldn™t. Th
ere was no way. Cause first you got this 
idea to betraying your religion, betraying y
our parents, your grandparents. But Œ so 
that™s a shi Œ there was no way for a Hasidi
c girl to get safe. But there were those 
who were hiding and there were Œ but th
at Œ th at was one of the ways, you could

always pray  and say prayers and 
Jesus
, 
Mary
 and all this, and Œ what you felt in 
your heart was a different story. And th en I 
ask one girl, I say, y-you don™t have Œ do 
you s Œ sometimes think th at you™re doing 
the wrong thing? And 
she says no, we all 
pray to th e same God. And the same thi
ng was, when I first started teaching th is 
Jewish lady, pau Œ saying th e prayers, some 
Œ some Œ I went to the priest and I say Œ 
because I thought I was doing bad thing c
onverting this Jewish lady, teaching her 
Polish prayers, Catholic prayers. And so I we
nt to this priest and I said Œ I took Œ you 
can go to confession and you know, and all 
that, and he says, well,
 confess your sins. 
And I said, well, I have this woman big Œ a
nd I don™t know if it™s a sin or not, and I 
was telling him that, you know, I was teaching 
this Catholic prayers to a woman who 
was Jewish, and was this a sin. And he sa
ys oh no, no, no, you™
ll be saving her life, 
no. So he give me a blessing a
nd told me to say three Holy 
Mary ™s
 and that thing 
was over. So  I thought that meant, because th
en I really knew that
 when she says we 
all believe in one God, so who Œ 
who Œ wh at does it matter. But Œ 
Q: You felt safe telling the priest that
 you were hiding a Jewish wo man? 
A: No, I wasn™t telling him hiding, I was telling him I was teaching her. But I was 

teaching her Catholic prayers, then he says 
[indecipherable]
 were you su ccessful? 
And I said, not very, cause the lady™s dea
f. And he was the one who said, well get 
some girlfra Œ don™t you have any 
other friends who could teach her? 

Q: So now you™re in this factor
y, what kind of factory is it? 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure  
February 2, 2001 

 

 
 
51
A: It™s a ch ewing tobacco factory. 
Q: And what were your duties? 

A: Well, when you chew Œ wh
en you make chewing to bacco there™s this Œ takes two 
people, one if Œ one that lays, dry stripsof tobacco leaves, they kind of small ones. 

And then after them goes the fello w who puts 
Œ I don™t know wh at it is, but they put 
Œ they cut up the tobacco, pu t it in some kind of prune juice to make it sweet, an d 

then you go and you Œ a-and you
 put that stuff on top Œ no, behind him and he goes 
and he takes a piece of this 
horrible chewing stuff and puts 
it on the leaf, and he rolls 
it into it, and it comes like a little sausage, co
ntinuous sausage and he
 just rolls it in. 
He gets to the end of it and he puts it 
on some kind of wh eel and the thing starts 
anew. And then they pu
t this tobacco sausage into this
 Œ into this syrup and it gets 
cooked, and then 
Œ then  they get it out again and th
ey  cut it in very tiny pieces, and 
then, this was supposed to help the war effort, because thi-th
is tobacco, that you 
don™t smoke it, you chew it. This is like 
a spitting Œ well, one time I saw somebody 
using it here, too, 
urch.
 But anyhow, one thing we lear
ned, that you cannot eat it, 
although was s-sweet, because a Œ one of 
us got sick from it. But, so I was doing 
that, and then one day Œ 
Q: Did you see any other groups of Jews? 
A: No, just those, that was Œ 

Q: That was that one group. 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure  
February 2, 2001 

 

 
 
52
A: That was that one group and there™re 
no mo re Jews Œ Jewish girls from any place 
coming. There was Œ they were get Œ getting 
us. And then we also said, we-ell, after 
they Œ after them we™ll go away because they were 
[indecipherable] 
girls comi ng, 
so we thought, oh, they™re g
onna do with us the same thi
ng th ey did with the Jewish 
girls, but they didn™t. So Œ but we were a
ll so scared to death 
then, cause we thought 
well, we™re the next ones. 
Q: Did you get enoug
h food to eat?  
A: I don™t really reme mb er, food was never 
very important to me, but I think Œ oh, 
no, no, we didn™t, but there were always
 the civilian Germans 
who would sn eak food 
for us. Like, if you had this woman, 
or the man for wh om you work ed, and 
especially if you spoke their language, they
 would always help you. I reme mb er the 
first time there was Œ I had this man Œ 
boy, who Œ hm, I don™
t know how we got 
together with this boy there.
 I was working for him, or he
 Œ but anyhow Œ or th Œ he 
worker for z Œ on the other ta ble. But anyhow he says to 
me one day, look in that Œ 
on th at shelf and Œ and sometimes we would ta
lk to Œ I would talk to this boy and I 
was telling him how the Germans were horrible in 
Poland
 and all this kind of stu Œ 
and Œ and he Œ I thought he was gonna Œ a
nd I told him how I love books and I can™t 
find the books. So  I thought he gave me a 
book. And it turned  out to be a piece of 
cake from his mother, and he says, that™s
 fro m my mother. And then there Œ the 
other guys started making fun, that he was in
 love with me, so the mother, who was a

spinner took him away and he was helpin
g her and I got some Œ and I was helping 
so me o th er men . Bu t an yho w, someti mes, 
you know, they woul
d put something fo r 
you in th e Œ or give you so me
thing. And later on they  ask 
us to come to their house 
and there was this big Œ big sign th at says 
fraternization with the 
Poles is forbidden, 
don™t you ever have them at your table a
nd all that. But the way th ey  went around 
this, that they would say, we need  wo rker
 in my house, or in my garden. Because 
most of these people were in a small farm 
[indecipherable]
 and all that, so they 
needed  help . And I heard one woman that, 
I don™t know how I got to talking about 
smoked fish. And I says oh, I™m dreaming of that smoked fish 
[indecipherable]
 
smoked fish and 
scruts
(ph) and all that. And he says
, you dreaming about that? And 
I say yeah, because I™m hungry. And wa 
Œ he said, you know, when  we get the 
smoked fish on rations, then you Œ I Œ you 
come to my  house. And I said, didn™t you 
see this where it says no Œ and they said Œ 
and I said, the only wa
y you can get me is 
to say you need a help to work  
[indecipherable]
 every house in 
Germa ny
 had this 
supervisor was a 
Hitlerjugend
 Œ I mean a 
Hitler Œ
 a Nazi party woman that watched 
over the houses so nothing happened. So
 when we heard this wo man coming, I 
always went on the floor, you know, and pr
etended to be pu Œ shi Œ shining it or 
scrubbing it, whatever it was, you know. 
But th ere were people who almo st, you 
know, I was just pure lucky, we all were 
pure lucky, and that™s
 why I wrote this 
book, because wh
en my father 
[indecipherable]
 this conversation, I said no, not all

54
Germans were brutal, cruel and all that. It
 wa s the syste m, but there were some good 
people, 
a h  b a -b a -b a -ba
, so that™s why this whole book came about, but Œ 
Q: We-We™ll talk about the book. Th
is factory was in the town of 
Hanewacker
? 
A: No, in the ha Œ
 Hanewacker 
was the name of the factory and it was the town of
 
N o rd ha u s en
. 
Q: Oh, you were already in 
No rdha usen
, okay. 
A: Mm-hm, that was in 
Nordhausen
. 
Q: I see. And did y
ou live in a barracks? 
A: We lived in a barracks and the first Œ wh en we got there Œ when I got up in the 

mo rning, the first Œ cause you 
had to get Œ there were thre
e stories of beds Œ I mean, 
three tiers of beds, I didn't know how to  ge
t up on them. Course
, everybody got the f 
Œ you know, the ground floor. I g 
Œ I Œ there mu st have been a 
[indecipherable]
 they 
just pushed me up and said, now finally. Bu
t early in the morning, I wanted to 

practice coming down, how to Œ not to tram
ple on th e girl under me. And I went to 
the window and it was somebody closing th
e window. Th-There were Œ not the 
windows, but the Œ 

Q: Shutters? 
A: Shutters. And the guy ki
nd of, you know, beckoned me
 to look out. And he says 
to me, look Œ look at the world before
 I lock you up. And 
Œ but I didn™t know 
whether I should say I understand what he is
 saying or not, because at that time I

55
didn™t know wh ether it was good to say you k
now it, or it™s better to be quiet so you 
know what they 
gonna do with him. 
And so I said Œ 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: Œ you know, like that. Turn
 out that this man was the supervisor of the barracks, 
kind of physical superv isor, 
you know. And so we all Œ he
 was so good we all called 
him
 Opa
, which means grandfather in
 
German. And so that™s Œ that™s how it was and 
then you had to get up, I don™t know
 how Œ what time in the morning and 
[indecipherable]
 for this breakfast. Oh yeah, and there were no toilets, toilets were 
also in the barrack, a separate barrack. And 
were not Œ not toilets, was just a hole in 
a Œ you know, kind of a hole in the grou
nd and Œ but Œ and th
e toilet paper were 
pieces of little newspaper, I read that 
a little bit, at leas
t it was something. 
Q: What about clothes, di
d they  give you clothes? 
A: No, we were Œ oh yeah, 
you Œ no, we had our
 own cl Œ and than ks God I had my  
winter coat, which was wool
en, and Œ but they  gave us
 smocks, so that you Œ 
whatever you were Œ y
ou always wore a white smock and a little thi Œ 
Q: And your own shoes? 
A: Yeah, own, yeah. A
lthough they did still Œ 
although I think they gave us a pair of 
those wo oden Œ 

Q: Clogs? 

A: Clogs, yeah.

Q: Were you menstruating then ? 
A: I think I was, yeah. 

Q: Did th ey ha Œ provid
e you with any supplies? 
A: No, no. We just use anythi
ng we could. But Œ or maybe they Œ no, they didn™t. I 
don™t think they did. 

Q: And so Œ 

A: We used toilet paper and all kind of stuff. 
Q: And how long were
 you in the chewing tobacco factory? 
A: Janu Œ February Œ hm, I think it was May,
 because that™s where we got kicked out 
because in the 
[indecipherable]
 factory, we were together with the British 
POWs
. 
Q: They were working 
in the factory also? 
A: Yeah, also. And they
 were the wounded at 
Dunkirk,
 so they co uldn™t do any Œ 
they were not supposed to 
be working anyhow, but they
 were work ing doing easy 
work . And of course we we
re flirting with them and 
passing letters and all that. 
Q: Did you understa
nd any English? 
A: No. And Œ no. And Œ 
Q: By th e way, did you have any conn
ection with your fam
ily, I mean letters? 
A: Yeah, letters, there were 
letters and then later on when I Œ later on when I Œ well, 
when I worked for this
 private ana Œ f-firm, I used to 
send the letters through this

lady. Sh e would send my  letters to 
Poland
 and I would receive the letters to her 
house. 
Q: So you have 
this correspondence? 
A: Yes, I have the correspondence. But anyhow Œ 

Q: You were talking about the British 
POWs
. 
A: 
POWs
, and then  we always Œ we had to  wear this 
P
 on our th ings 
and we always 
Œ once Œ if we behave we wo
uld be given a Sunday off. 
I don™t know how many, one 
Sunday a month or something like that. 

Q: What di-di Œ wh at did your
 P 
look like? 
A: Well, it was a yellow b
ackground with a purple 
P
 on it, and you had to wear it 
like on your heart, and all that kind of st
uff. But of course you can always cover it up 
with a scarf. So when we we
nt out, we always covered th
at with a scarf or we ripped 
it off. 

Q: It was sewn on? 
A: Yeah, it was supposed to be sewn on. 
Q: How did you feel having to wear that? 

A: Awful, I mean I Œ 
Q: Why? 
A: Why? Because I 
[in d ecipherable]
 you feel like you™re subhuman or something, 
was the time to humiliate you, ju
st like there was the Star of
 David
, that™s just

58
exactly the same thing. And 
Œ but with at Œ with it you 
couldn™t go anyplace, and we 
just found out that Œ oh yeah , and of 
course this Œ this man whom we call
 Opa
, next 
Œ across the street from that camp, those ba
rracks, there was a Œ not a restaurant, but 
kind of joint and he said, will you be co
ming by? Bring me a b
eer. And so we would 
go and bring him a beer and we always Œ 
an d he would never look at our passes, 
whether they Œ cause you had to  have a 
pass. Sometimes we had a pass that wa s 
already a month old, you know. Bu t he never 
Œ but he told  us to
 watch out for other 
guys, if there™s someb o dy else, to be ve
ry careful and all that. Well, anyhow, we 
trespassed the law of th e camp many a many 
times and finally we got kicked out of 
this ammu -ammunition factory, 
Schmidt 
and
 Kranz
, with Œ which was really 
working for the metal 
-- metalwerker
(ph) which was making those 
V-1s
 and

later on.

 And you were saying that you we
re going to have to  move out of
 Hanewacker
 
because Œ what kind of th
ings did you do wrong that  made you have to move? 
A: Well, in the first place we were
 going out without a Œ a Œ without this
 P
, without 
the Œ you know, the sign that we are Pole
s. And then we were
 flirting with the

59
British prisoners and sending a
nd receiving letters and then
 there were some German 
women who were corresponding with the 
[indecipherable]
 so we Œ oh, we did them 
favors too, and all this and well, anyhow Œ 
Q: Did you realize how dangero us that was? 
A: No, I have absolutely no 
idea how dangerous. The first 
time that I was Œ this is Œ 
we were four people, four girl
s, and one of them says, what
 would I do to be in a real 
restaurant? And so we said, why not? We
 could, since we have a Sunday off we 
could get dressed. But we really didn™t ha
ve good shoes and all that. But since we 
knew the German women who are flirting w
ith the British, we could Œ we thought 
we ca Œ we could possibly ask them to he
lp us, you know? And so I said, can you 
borro w Œ can I borro w a pair of shoes of 
Œ from you? And she said, what for? And I 
said, well, 
Janka
 has this idea Œ or 
Hedwig
 was her na Œ real name, 
Hedwig
 has this 
idea that she would love to go to a good 
German restaurant a
nd we saw, on our way 
to church we saw this restaurant. And sh
e says no, you could 
never go there because 
that™s all th is Nazi cra Œ cream goes to
 that restaurant, they would immediately  
recognize a s-stranger. If you really want to
 go, you can go to some kind of a little 
café or a 
konditori
(ph) which is this Œ he servescoffee and also serves cakes. And 
you could go to something like that. There,
 nobody will notice it Œ notice you. So Œ 
but, I mean, there™s no way for you to be su
ccessful going to  a fine restaurant, but 
this girl is just dreaming of going to  a fi
ne restaurant after all these crummy meals

and barracks and all this. And 
so Œ and then  one time Œ what we didn™t know is that 
N o rd ha u s en
 was this forbidden place where they
 were making those Œ before they 
started making 
V-1s, V-2s, 
there were underg ro und galleries where they making 
bombers and practicing inventions
 or, I mean , trying out stuff. 
Q: But you were not aw are of that? 
A: No, I was not aware. So those two girls go
t a bicycle. Now, there was this bice Œ I 
don™t know how this happened, but those 
two girls, since the Germans were so 
helpfu l, you know, th-this Œ oh no, this Œ so
me Œ this Œ one of the girls says, I would 
so love to get on a bicycle, and she says
, oh you can take mine, the German woman 
said. And then Œ then  the other one got 
a bicycle from somebody else and took off 
the 
[indecipherable]
 and went. Except that they hadn™t
 been on a bicy
cle for so long 
that they were going like this, wa Œ left, ri
ght, left, right, and then  the other girl was 

scared to fall off, so she was just pushi
ng the bicycle. And the policeman saw her 
doing it, and Œ and he wanted to  help he
r. And then, while he was helping her, he 
says, there™s nothing wrong with  this bi
cycle, but wh ile she was getting up, she 
brushed on her Œ he brus
hed on her coat and well, they 
both end up in jail, and they 
said Œ 
Q: He saw the
 P
, you mean? 
A: He saw the
 P
, okay. And there™s the one time we 
got this idea of going out on the 
railroad by a train, you know, ju st to see 
what it looks like outside of the barracks. 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure  
February 2, 2001 

 

 
 
61
And we asked this Œ a-again we made this
 mistake of asking a ticket to this place 
where the factory was, because we had no
 idea where it was. And Œ and I remember 
saying tw o tickets Œ or sa Œ no, a round trip
 ticket. And the guy says Œ and there was 
this 
[indecipherable]
 anyhow, they were Œ but, this 
factory didn™t want to lose me 
because I was this interp
reter, you know, so I Œ 
Q: So Œ so he saw the 
P 
and he did not sell you th e ticket? 
A: No, th ey said, of course not. The wo man who was selling me the ticket says, I™m 
sorry, I didn™t know they were Poles,
 they had tickets Œ I mean, they had 
Ps.
 I mean, 
they looked so normal, we didn™t think 
they  were Poles, you 
know. Bu t anyhow, so 
that was on our Œ and so this grandpa s Œ wa
s saying, watch out, this is the last time 

that I can intervene for you. Because with
 the bicycle what happened, so she didn™t 
come in, she says, where is she? And I said
, well, I don™t know, she hasn™t come in 
yet. So she called the police and she says
, you wouldn™t see a Œ you haven™t seen a 
Polish girl with a yellow Œ a yel Œ a red Œ 
Po lish redhead  on a bicycle? She mu st me 
Œ mus Œ could have had an 
accident or some, was there Œ oh no, there was a Polish 
redhead on a accident or someth
ing. He says no, she™s not in accident, she™s in jail. 
And so, but then she came the 
next mo rning. But Œ and Œ but she swore that she just 
took the bicycle, that she st ole the bicycle. No, no, nots
 what she said, sh-she saw 
this bicycle in the Œ outside the barracks 
and it was a broken bicycle and she fixed it. 
That™s what she lie. A nd the German woma
n was kissing her all over that she didn™t

betray her that she give her the bicycle, 
but Œ but anyhow, so then th  Œ we already 
had all this on our index, and th
ey said that™s it. And so  th
at™s how they push this in 
the Œ send us to work. We re
ally know that we are in a camp, and that was the nation 
Œ 
Q: So you were in 
Nordhausen
 for a few months Œ 
A: Yeah, and Œ 

Q: Œ and then you were sent Œ 
A: I mean, it Œ 
Q: Œ I mean, you were in 
Hanewacker
 for a few months. 

A: Few months, and then I went to  this Œ 
we were sent to this mashee Œ machine 
ammunition factory called
 Schmid t 
and

A: Well Œ well, we were doing all kind of 
metalwork and all that kind of stuff, you

thing. But, since they knew 
I spoke German, there was this old major who Œ who st Œ

 old guy. And of 
course he had this ear phones on him and 
was keep on shooting and I didn™t know 

how to get to him, so I just

of the house here or not? And well any
how, somehow he heard me and I gave him 
the message and he Œ while he was reading 
this he says, go and get me some coffee 
in the canteen, they

there™s this man looking down
 and he says, the big one would be the better one to do 
what you™re doing. I said, I™m not doing a
nything, but I was saying in German. And 
he says, ah, if they catch you that you are 
cheating their factory o-of time for the four 
of you, you gonna wind yoursel
f in a worse camp than the

Kranz

I said, well, she is carrying something. A
nd at that time I don™t know wh at she was 
carrying, her shoes or some
thing, I don™t rememb er, but anyhow, it saved me. But, 
couple of months after that Œ

talking to me, the civilian. But instead of as
 Œ waiting for my answers, he starts some 
other Œ you know, cu ts another theme, I 
mean, asking a different question without 
wa Œ waiting for the answer. So he, after awh
ile he says to me in French, thank you 
for you™re an Œ thank you. And I say in Fren ch

A: O-Oh yeah, because Œ 
Q: Wha Œ how did th at happen? 

A: How did that happen? Well, the French
 who were working on the outside, the 
French civilians were providi
ng f Œ if some Œ if the English wanted to escape Œ if the 
English 
POWs
 wanted to escape, they needed 
I.D.
 cards, clothing, and all that kind 
of stuff, and tho Œ the French civilians 
who were delivering it. But we got this 
message th at there™ll b e no delivery tonight.
 And we had to give this to Œ somehow 
let the English prisoners of war know. Bu t 
we were in contact with the girls who 
were still staying in 
Hanewacker
 so that we could telegraph 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: How were you in contact with them?

Q: What were they doing there? 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure  
February 2, 2001 

 

 
 
67
A: Oh, they were not in a camp, they were 
on the outside. They 
were slave workers, 
with th Œ except th
at they were not 
slave workers, the 
Vichy
 government had to  
provide a certain number of French laborers ex Œ and even the French 
POWs
 never 
went Œ had it a little easier too, because they 
didn™t have to march togeth er, they just 
Œ they were two or th ree employed in a 
bakery, or there was butch Œ butch er or 
someplace like that, you know, so 
they Œ they  were free and they  could do things that 
nobody else could. And so how we gonna 
do this tonight? At that moment I was 
giving Russian lessons to this
 guardsman, cause he wanted
 to go to  the eastern front, 
so he was Œ he was Œ he didn't like the Œ 
he was afraid of the camp superv isor, who 
was a horrible woman, but he said that if 
I was cau Œ he was caught with me, giving 
me this lesson, it wouldn™t be so bad beca
use we can always say I was just doing 
something for him. But any
how, so when we got this 
news, I was teaching him, I 
don™t rememb er was a difficult 
[indeciphera ble]
 idiot anyhow, wan
ting to go to the 
eastern front. But Œ 

Q: You knew Russian? 
A: Yeah 
[indeciphera ble]
 
Q: How did you know Russian? 
A: How did I know Russian? From the tailor.
 He Œ he would give me a Œ a Œ no, I 
would bring my  coat to be pr
essed, or something like that and in order to keep  me

busy he would give me a Œ a Russian, becau
se he was a White Russian, that™s where 
the White Russians Œ 
Q: This is the tailor in 
Kraków
? 
A: Yeah, and he Œ th ey were
 White Russians, and so he 
would give me this Russian 
newspaper and 
[indecipherable]
 I said, I can™t read it, an
d he Œ every time I came he 
would give me a different Ru
ssian letter to print, and to
 learn to Œ so I knew how it 
was Œ you know, I could read, but I didn't  kno
w what I was reading, but that™s besi Œ 
the same th ing that I did with this German
, that I could perfectly typing and writing, 

didn™t know wh at I was doing. And he Œ 
an yhow, was wor Œ easy word s I could tell, 
I mean, and Œ 
Q: So you™re teaching this guy? 
A: Teaching this guy, and the 
girl says finish it, finish 
it, oh we Œ I have news for 
you, you know. And then she says, we™ve a 
Œ got to do something, and aw Œ for my  
bad luck , the guy who Œ who wa
tches the camp for this woma
n, had to go around to 
see if all barracks were closed. And he leav
es the door open. So I was going to climb 
though the window an
yhow to get to the telephone, 
and get in touch with these 
friends who was on the 
PWs
 line. I mean, he was thei
r helper, you know, like he 
sometimes will let him go. Or if they went 
to shop, he would, you know be easy f Œ 
on th em. And Œ but this guy leaves this door
 open, okay? And I call and I say th Œ 
call this numb Œ or Œ no, how is that I di
dn™t know the telephon
e numbers? It t o ok

me quite a while cause I didn™t know where 
to look for the number
 of the camp. But 
then I see oh, she™s got a whole list there in
 front of her of the camps, you know. But 
I Œ I just called and then I said, may I speak to 
Fritz
? And this says, 
[indecipherable]
 
Fritz, 
and
 
I know Œ oh, you™re not the 
one I want. And I made this 
mistake saying you™re not the 
one that I want, that was number one mistake. And sh e 
slammed the thing down . Then Œ but since 
I was having my finger on the number, 
they know what I was calling. And so she ca
lls Œ she says, who is this, what™s this, 
and I made a st Œ absolutely idiotic mistake 
and I said, well, I just
 w anted to get in 
touch with a German soldier I 
used to know. And that™s ag
ainst all the Œ so, she calls 
it, she calls this number, and he says
, would you please 
stop bothering me? 
[indecipherable]
 you Œ and I think he called her a b
itch, but I no Œ that™s what she 
said anyhow. She says, if you had a boyfrien
d that was a nice fellow, I wouldn™t say 
anything, but 
bah-ba-b a-ba-b a. 
And so, how did you get here in Œ so, and I said 
well, it was open. And of course that wa
s number three mistakes because the guy 
was supposed to lock the office, left it ope
n. So f Œ th ree things against him, so 
anyhow, she hit this a bam Œ a bamboo stic
k and he says Œ wh ac
ks, whacks, whacks. 
And anyhow he beat me too, but anyhow
 Œ and I didn™t know anything would 
happen because finally fa
inted, you know, because 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: You were so badly hurt? 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure  
February 2, 2001 

 

 
 
70
A: Yeah, but I think that I was so glad 
that I was hurt, because they would have 
beaten it out of me. 
Q: The information? 
A: Yeah, that I knew the German guard w
ho was helping the Br
itish. And Œ and the 
guy, when we once ask him why, he says
, well, one day I may be a British prisoner 
of war, and Œ well, anyhow. So that™s how I got Œ 
Q: 
[indecipherable]
 did you get back to your barrack after you were beaten? 
A: I don™t know how it happened, but a
nyhow I found myself der Œ with girls 
looking at me and they said Œ and they sa
ys, you didn™t say anything, because if you 
said something you wouldn™t be 
here any mo re. But I was also 
[indeciphera ble]
 so 
then this guard, this 
Willie
 came and brought me some 
hot tea and some sandwiches 
from the girls and I couldn™t eat anything
 because my  mouth was so swollen. And 
the kid says Œ 

Q: Did th ey beat you all over your body, or just your face? 
A: I don™t mi Œ my  body too, of course
. Bu t anyhow, he says, oh this is not 
[indecipherable]
 he said, you write Œ see ya Œ I th
ink I™m gonna write a letter to the 
Red Cross, they™re not suppos
ed to do things 
like that. This is not a concentration 
camp, this is a labor camp. And I say 
Willie
, it™s not for civilians, Red Cross is only 
for military  and you better not 
get involved in this. And 
I said to myself, what on 
earth Œ how can this fellow want to be 
[indecipherable]
 an 
SS
 man. But the only

71
reason wh y he was, cause he wanted to go
 to the eastern front
. But anyhow, that™s 
how, after Œ oh yeah , and this old mayor Œ 
major, so used to this coffee business and 
the biscuits, says where is she, what™s 
the matter? Nobody brings me coffee. And 
they said well, she is sick
 in camp. And Œ what happened to her. An d she said, but t 
Œ if you don™t Œ we tell you 
wh at happened , but don™t tell 
anybody else. But he calls 
the camp, and the doctor come
s and lo oks me over and he sa
ys nah, you™re gonna be 
okay. And nothing on the inside was hurt. 
So that™s how Œ that™s why I already was 
in sort of a Œ people were kind of lookin
g out for me, fo Œ an
d I was looking for a 
way out of this. So when this  opportunity to be
 this interpreter in kitch Œ I didn™t 
know Œ the girl says to me, are you crazy
? You don™t know what it means to be a 
kitchen help. You have to s-
s Œ to peel potatoes and cut 
[indecipherable]
 and all that 
kind of stuff. I said, I™d  do anything, I wo
uld even make up fo r that man if I could 
get out of here. And so that™s how I was tr
ansferred to this priv
ate comp any, but the 
private comp any was work ing with Œ because 
they were in this Œ that was a building 
comp any and th ey would go to
 the woods and get these hu
ge stumps of trees, you 
know, that they would use to
 support the galleries in th
e underground factory and all 
that kind of stuff. So Œ 
Q: So how long were you at 
Schmidt
 and
 Kranz
? 
A: I was not very long, because from Œ 
Q: You were a few months in 
Han e wa cker
 Œ 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure

72
A: 
[indecipherable]
, yeah, from
 Hanewacker
, then at 
Schmid t
 and
 Kranz
, that 
was like from May to August
 and in August or September I was already out.  
Q: In septem Œ and yo
u Œ in September, mm-hm. 
A: Mm-hm, so it wasn™t long. And I stayed
 there til the end of stin Œ til liberation. 
Q: Okay . 
A: And the reason wh y he
 got me out of this 
Schmid t
 and
 Kranz
 was because he 
knew all this Gestapo and he wo
rk in this Œ the Œ see, the 
SS 
already was in this 
build ing, running concentration camps for pr
ofit. So there is somehow Œ anyhow, he 
knew enough people to get me out to his fi
rm. Then when the tim
e came to deliver 
me back to the camp, he had my  Œ he agai
n used his connections 
not to send me back 
to the camp, and he really saved my lif
e. And I know that because I read his 
correspondence while I was clea
ning his room, hi-his office and so I know th ere was 
a correspondence about when are you sending 
this Œ this woman back, or this girl 
back and all that. Then I said
 to the children Œ they had tw
o children, I said to them, 
well, you better watch Œ I don™t think I will 
be telling you any more stories, because 
I have to go away. And they
 said, oh no, you™re not goin
g away, my Œ my  daddy and 
mo mmy  and doing anything just to keep  you here. 
Q: What was the name of the family?

live first? I think I lived 
upstairs, there was a little 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: You lived in their house? 

A: In their house, yeah, yeah. 

Q: And you said something about he wa
s making money off of the concen tration 
camps, in what sense? 

A: In Œ cause he was delivering the Œ no, he Œ 

Q: Supplies? 

A: Supplies to Œ to th

A: Oh my  gosh, peeling potatoes and 
ruta bags. 
Cleaning th e old lady Œ his mo ther™s 
Œ no, his mo ther didn™t never employ me, she 
only Œ his old mo ther only asked me to 
carry wood into the house so I could take 
a bath in her bathtub, because they didn™t 
want to send me to delousing, because th
at would take a whole day. So there was 
some kind of shower someplace 
in the building in this Œ in
 this Russian kitchen, so 
to say for me to take a shower there. So Œ 
Q: Th-They didn™t want
 to send you where? 
A: To the delousing. 

Q: Oh, to  delousing.  

A: Delousing. 
Q: This is when you 
first came, y ou mean? 
A: Yeah. And it Œ so, I was telling her it was too co ld in th ere, you know. Sh e says, 
well you don™t have to get Œ this old lady sa
ys, you don™t have to
 Œ to go there, you 
can take a bath in my  house. She says, 
don™t tell my  son or my  Œ especially my  
daughter-in-law. And I was Œ I would be carry
ing a big basket of Œ the first time it 
happened  she told me to bring this big ba
sket of wood. And I said, what™s happening 
to her? I mean, she never asked me to do any heavy work, so all of a sudden Œ well, 
anyhow, she had the servant an
d the servant would say Œ she 
says, well, that™s just a 
camouflage so you can take a bath. And then
 her son find that out. And he says, 
Mother, I know what you™re do
ing. If my wife finds out, there™s gonna be a mu rder

in this house. Well, she says, we™re not 
gonna tell her. So she di Œ she didn™t, but 
somehow her mo ther, the young wo man, his 
wife™s Œ I don™t know what it is, I mu st 
have Œ that™s another mistake I made, 
cause she says, you like the old Mrs. 
Ratzfeldt
(ph)? And I said oh yeah, she remi nds 
me of my  grandmother, or wh atever, 
and besides, she lets me take a bath. And 
then this woman was jealous that she lets 
me take a b ath, so she woul
d say, oh you can ta
ke a bath in my thing. But she had 
the diabetes and I said Œ I thought that 
was some kind of sickness you can catch, you 
know, and I said oh, no thank 
you, I Œ anyhow, and I Œ so Œ 
Q: You™re using the wood
 to heat the water? 
A: Yeah. And, you know, it™s kind of stov
e when you use the wo
od. But anyhow, so 
it was Œ was really Œ it was really ridiculo
us already. So  I cleaned this hi Œ her 
mo ther™s house and her Œ she told her mo th
er, she doesn™t know how to do anything, 
she doesn ™t even know how to sweep the 
floor. And I said, excuse me, but I do 
know. I mean, I used to Œ I 
don™t know what I told them
, but anyhow, I would have 
done anything ju st to Œ so I had to Œ an
d then , I had to give the children French  
lessons. And then, if they had guests, b
ecause lots of times, you know, in business 
like that you entertain a lot, so I had to wo
rk overtime. Clean the dishes and all that. 
Since you in Œ but she was a fantastic c
ook, so Œ an yhow, this old lady had th e 
servant hang up over the hous
e entrance a sign that says God bless this house. Then  

the young lady would Œ the wife woul
d come out, take it down and put 
heil Hitler

sign. And I never off Œ forgot how she sa
id to me, go and hang it out. And I said, 
well, I™m small, I mig h t fall down. But 
anyhow, she said Œ I was doing it so 
awkwardly that Œ that she gr
abs it away from me, gets on th
is chair and almost fells 
over, you know, but i-it was such a funny 
Œ and I took it all like an adventure. 
Q: How did you celebrate your 18
th
 birthday? 
A: Gee, I don™t remember.  
Q: You were in this house, it™s October ™42. 
A: Oh yes, I didn™t celebra
te, they celebrated for me. 
Oh yeah, and I also had to 
work in a garden. This
 woman had a garden  outside the 
city, the old mu Œ the mother 
of the young wo man, and I had to Œ and 
this one day Œ I forgot all about my  
birthday, and I Œ sh-she always gives me 
work, extra work and I said please hurry 
up, because I™ll be late for th
e Russian kitchen, I have to
 get the food out. And she 
always finds this stuff to do for me, do th
is or that. And I used to pull a little wagon 
in the middle of the street and it was 
loaden
 with potatoes or fru
its or whatever she 
got, or 
[indecipherable]
. And I get there and she kind of laughs an d I look to  Œ go to  
the Russian kitchen and it says, all food ha
s been given out, it™s all done. The kitchen 
is closed. And I go upstairs a
nd I open the door to this little
 room, and I can™t believe 
my eyes. This had curtains on the wind
ows and it had like a little table there and 
there were books on a sh
elf. And somebody says, hap
py birthday and th ere were 
those Œ the man and the woma
n. And that™s how I starte
d celebrating my  birthday,

because in Œ in Catholic countries you cel
ebrate your name™s days for the name of

Adam

 Eve
 are not exactly saints, 
but Œ but they on th e Œ 
their day comes on the 24
th
 of December, that™s where 
Adam 
and
 Ev e
 celebrate their 
birthdays. And so that™s how 
I cele Œ I really beautifully
 celebrated my  birth Œ and 
then I said to myself, I used
 to believe in guardian ange

Ratzfeldts
(ph) employed Ru ssians, foreign slave workers. And of 
course they got different rations than th
e Frenchmen. The Frenchmen got better food 
rations than the Russians. And so, since th
ere were so many of them, I think 32 or 
something like that, they had to Œ the Œ th
ey  Œ the old lady and her ma id origin ally 
were the bosses of this Russian kitchen, but 
then they couldn™t manage it, so his wife 
became the boss of this kitchen. And of 
course, her mo ther was helping her. That 
was just too big a kitchen fo r one. But anyhow, I Œ wh at I was doing is washing 

dishes and peeling potatoes 
and starting the fire and bringing Œ making the co ffee 

and the sandwiches for the Frenchmen, and 
then the Ru ssians came and I would give 
them her breakfast and her br Œ their bread
 and then I would sn
 Œ all day long cook 
the so-soup for the Russia
ns. And there was always a different stuff for the 
Frenchmen, too. And th en
 when  the people from the concentration camp came, 
because we Œ they Œ she 
also employed people in 
concentration camps and 
Dora
 was 
started, he also employed the people fro
m the concentration camp s, and Œ well, 
anyhow, to make a long story short, he wa
nted  to Œ I was looking out the window 
seeing prisoners coming and 
he says, oh you Œ you making signs at them, which I

was, and I said no, I was just watching wh
y they  walk so  slowly, you know, because 
through that street there 
was a column s of Œ of Œ of
 concentration camps people 
passing by. And I say, an hour
 or so, oh so , so slow. And he says yeah, I wonder 
about that too. It takes four of them to lift a Œ lift a Œ  

Q: Tr-Trunk? 

A: Trunk. And of co urse he says, I Œ and I 
say, my  Œ must be hungry. So  she says, 
ask what they getting to eat
. And of course I asked a 
ka po
, and I asked the co ok, 
because they also had there 
another cook, cause we just 
couldn't Œ I coul
dn™t make it. 
And he says well, I don™t Œ we Œ she woul
dn™t tell us, because she thought it was a 
catch and th e cook wouldn™t eat it. And 
I said, why don™t you ask them yourself? 
Cause they wouldn™t tell me. 
And so eviden tly Œ he says
 he don™t have paper, he 
looks like they™re getting 
en ough to  eat. And the
 ka po
 says sure, and all on paper it 
looks enough, but by th e time everybody stea
ls, the prisoners don™t get anything, or 
hardly  anything. And so  this wo man used to
 get couple of those Russian workers and 
go into the fields and there 
[indecipherable]
 around, an d she would say w-we can g-

glean your fields. And so Œ but the people
 who were leaving the potatoes or the 
rutabags
(ph) knew that she would come and pick
 them up so they always left some 
extra, and that™s how she cooked the soup fo
r Œ to add it to the prisoners, because the 
guy said Œ th e 
ka po
 said, well, she wants us to wo
rk. He says, a slav e only works 
when  somebody™s watching him, but I, of cour
se, didn™t tell him th at. But I say, if he

wants us to work  mo re, then he has to give
 us food. And so that
™s exactly what the Œ 
he was thinking too, you know. That™s ho
w they started cooking those soups. And Œ 
Q: Who Œ who were the concentrati
on camp victims, were they Jews? 
A: N-No , ther Œ ther Œ I don™t know who th
ey were but I don™t think they were Jews. 
I think they were just Poles and French , Poles, Frenchmen and Germans who wer Œ 
anybody who was in Œ in the Œ in
 Mittelbau-D ora
. More Œ lots of them were people 
who knew how to Œ were former technicians 
or former engineers, or Œ or they  Œ of 
course there was just simple labor force, 
too, but I mean Œ I-I really never learned 
who they  were, you know. And I don™t know wh
ether they were Jews or not. They  
probably were.  

Q: Did you see any Jews when  y
ou were living with this family? 
A: You can tell, that ev erybody has a st
ripped Œ and most of them were political 
because they di Œ they 
had red triangles. So Œ 

Q: So you didn™t see yellow stars? 
A: No. 
Q: Who Œ who was 
Gise Œ Gisel a
(ph)
 Œ Gisela
(ph)?  
A: Oh, 
Gisela
(ph) was a niece of the boss of Œ in
 the lumb eryard, one of the bosses 
in the lumberyard, and they liv
ed on a side house, in the 
same side where the French 
slave labor Œ oh, not slave, they were not slave 
[indecipherable]
 the French wer Œ 
work ers were living. And after we got th
ose two Russian girls and they occupied

those two rooms under the roof, I didn't  have a place to stay, so the old Mrs. 
Ratzfeldt
(ph) said I could live in the r
oom where her son used to live. 
Q: In her Œ in her house? 
A: Yeah, in the Œ and the son was on th e ea
stern front. And so  wh en the family of 
the boss called 
Langer
(ph) came out of 
Hamburg
, they were bumped out, he took 
them in their house. And so  the girl, 
Gisele
(ph) was staying with me, and that™s who 
it was and we became friends. 
Q: I just wanted to read a little bit from 
your book, and if you could then elaborate 
on it wh en I finish Œ 
A: Okay . 
Q: Œ I would appreciate it. 
Gisela
(ph) is telling you, you 
know you™re getting mo re 
and more over-sensitive, 
she said. And you answer, 
ﬁhow can I avoid being 
oversensitive, when I feel as if I™
m in a cage, even a big one like the 
Rath shear™s
(ph) lumberyard? Everything is so weird, people are afraid of me and 
I™m afraid of them and of the surroundin
gs. You don™t have to
 be afraid of all 
Germans, 
Gisela
(ph) was trying to  soothe my  nerv
es. Not all are rascals and not all 
are monsters.ﬂ And then  you say, ﬁanyone ca
n be a rascal or a monster. Give a man a 
gun, teach him to hate, give him prisoners
 and a free hand with them and the best 
man will become a rascal, if 
not a complete monster at 
one time or another. Even a

child will lend his hand to the sufferings of
 others.ﬂ Did you want to elaborate a little 
bit what you meant by that? 
A: Well, it was this obvious, that I™ve s
een it happen and that
™s how you probably 
turn or Œ so-called ordinary people in
to monsters when they have power over 

somebody else™s, or they want to f-further a 
career, or they want to get more money, 
or they want to just show th
at they can do with other pe
ople what they want to do, 
that they are this powerful once. 
Q: When you were there, were you aware 
of what was happening in the rest of 
Euro pe
? Did you have a sense of what was goin
g on in th e other countries, and with 
the war? 

A: Well, I knew Œ well one time 
Gisel
(ph) and I were Œ I had a key to the house, and 
Gisel
(ph) Œ I was afraid to cross the yard, so
 I would open the fro
nt door and walk 
her to the side entrance of that Œ what 
do they call that, barrack
s. And since she was 
from
 Hamburg,
 one time we were Œ we were walk
ing and sh e was talking and there 
were two f-flyers, German flyers and they re
c Œ one of them says, hey, there™s a girl 
from
 Hamburg. 
And they started talking to her, and 
of course I was scared to death 
that they gonna discover me. And Œ well, an
yhow, is Œ this other one says Œ I don™t 
know wh at I said, and he says, oh, I hate 
those bastards. And I say, what bastards? 
And he says oh, those Polish 
flyers. They don™t care if th
ey die as long as they  get 
some of us down . And that™s how I lear
ned that there were Polish flyers in 
England
, 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure

83
you know, and I was almo st Œ and 
Gisela
(ph) was just shaking, just hope she doesn™t 
say anything to betray who she is. Of course
 I was so glad all of a sudden I was so Œ 
I was so glad that they are fighting, that
 they are there, youknow, and Œ anyhow, I 
made it up that somebody is calling us, so we
 went into the hous
e and I never went 
on the street again. But 
Gisela
(ph)
 
went out with this one flyer and the other one 
wanted a date, but of course that™s how it 
gets when you wear civilian clothes and a
 
P
, small, n o t like the Jewish star. 
Q: Uh-huh. So you were
 still wearing your 
P? 
A: Oh yeah, but of course when I went ou
t, y-you put it on Œ I put it so that it got 
under the Œ 
Q: Under the lapel. 
A: Œ lapel, and you Œ then, if somebody
 was looking, I Œ well anyhow, about the 

monsters, the 
Ratzfeldts
(ph) used me for many things. I mean, I had this Russian 
kitchen, that was my main job from f-five o™clock in the morn
ing til whenever the 
last dish was handed out and th e kitchen wa
s clean, okay? But they also would, if 
need be, do something Œ send me some
place. And one time they had to get 
something from the bank, so th ey send me to
 the bank. And in  order to get to the 
bank, since I didn™t ride the bicycle and I 
Œ and Œ a-and I couldn™t get on the tram Œ 
on the streetcar, cause I had this 
P
, but a-anyhow, I got to th
e bank and I Œ oh yeah, 
and in order to get on th e bus, I took off the
 P
, to get on a streetcar. But when I got

84
to the bank, I™m waitin g andwaiting, and I was to come 
home immediately with this 
paper that they needed. And th
e Œ the bank director comes 
out and he says to the boy 
on th e door, has this Pole showed up? And he
 says no. And I say, here I am. And the 
guy says, oh, but she doesn™t have her
 P
. An d he denounced me, and then th at even Œ 
that afternoon came two Gestapo men, or
 SS,
 whatever they are, and wa Œ that I de Œ 
did tell them, the
 Ratzfeldts
(ph) what happened, you kno
w, but they were to be 
punished  for letting me  walk and going Œ ge
tting me go to the bank and all that, so 
all this was hanging together. An d so when  they came, they said well, either you 
show her Œ I don™t know wh at he says Œ e
ither you teach her a lesson or we do. And 
that meant that he had to hit me and beat
 me, you know, so he did hit me, but with 
[indecipherable]
. And so after that when they left, you know, I was 
[crying]
. And 
he says Œ they called me in and I wouldn™t 
talk to them Œ and 
he says, what ha Œ 
what were we supposed to do? 
Q: Wh-Who Œ who was the one
 to beat you, your Œ 
A: The
 Ratzfeldt
(ph), the owner. And he says that if they would have done, if I 
hadn™t done, they wo uld Œ they  would ha
ve done. And he says
, and you know th e 
Gestapo. And I said no, I don™t 
[indecipherable]
 don™t tell me  the story because I 
know all about you and Œ 
and the Gestapo man in 
Kraków
 and all that. So I didn™t 
have Œ didn™t want to say anything. But I 
know that he Œ but that wasn™t his case, 

okay. But Œ but this guy in the camp too, 
you know, when he hit me, I mean, it was

85
just power, you just Œ sh ows how powerful he is, he 
[in d ecipherable]
 hit somebody 
and the somebody has to suffer. So Œ 
Q: Do you think that™s tr
ue of everyone, or some people resist that urge? 
A: Well, ins Œ under certain sim Œ circumst
an  Œ in circum Œ certain  circumstan ces, 
they™ll be very few people who are resistant. 
If you have to fear for your own life, or 
for your life of your family, or life of yo
ur co mmunity, you probably would do wh at 
they want you to do, if 
the system was like that 
Hitlerian
(ph) system was
 
Q: Di Œ when you said something before 
about you saw some of the concentration 
camp workers walking along th e street Œ 

A: Mm-hm. 
Q: Œ did you know what a concentration camp was, or wh at did it mean to you? 
A: Well, of course when they came to us Œ oh, well, I know that there was Œ there 

was supposed to be a p Œ I knew there we
re political prisoners and I already know 
about 
Auschwitz
 and all that. I know Œ but I had ab so
lutely no id ea what they  do in 
them. And just Œ they just we
nt to work, and they were 
dressed differently so that 
they couldn™t escape. 

Q: Did you know about the 
killings that were going on? 
A: No, no, because nobody was 
allowed to talk about it. No
 civilians Œ they wouldn™t 
even Œ I only learned that 
now from the things that I tr an slated for the museum, from 
the Gestapo in whatever, that they were 
not allowed to even 
write anything about 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure  
February 2, 2001 

 

 
 
86
what happened. So  that nothing Œ if you 
Œ somebody died in a concentration camp, 
they were just to give ora
lly the information, they were
 not to write, so that there 
really were no written accounts about that, 
except that the Germans could help but 
being a s Œ a Œ how can I say, they loved to
 write and have everything in order, so 
[indecipherable] 
some of them did write this stu
ff. But they were not allowed to. 
But I still thin Œ I think still 
that they treated German Je
ws better than they did any 
other Jews, because someplace I think that th
ey would return the 
urn with the ashes, 
even if it wasn™t the Œ the ashes of the one
s who died, and they could bury th em Œ I 
read it someplace in those i Œ in those Œ in
 those testimony, that they could bury 
them in a Jewish cemetery. So
 Œ but they wouldn™t 
do that for any other Jew, just the 
German Jew. 
Q: Di-Did you ever hear about
 the assassination attemp t on 
Hitler™s
 life? 
A: Oh yeah, everybody hear
d about that, you know, and Œ 
Q: What was your response, or your reaction? 
A: Gosh , how could he 
[indecipherable]
 now, in the first place, I d idn™t know Œ I 
thought everybody was for hi
m, see, because openly th e newspapers, the propag anda 
and nobody would say a word ag ainst, 
except that old lady with this 
heil Hitler
 sign 
that she didn™t want to have 
over her house. But I Œ I ask this lady, why is it that they 
want to assassinate him if he is getting so 
much land for him and so all this forced 
labors and all that, and bring so mu ch money 
into the thing, why 
would they  want to 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure

87
a-assassinate him? And he says well, be
cause he™s not doing the right things. And 
Mr. 
Ratzfeldt
(ph) said, I™ve Œ because Œ she was blaming the generals for losing the 
war in 
Russia
 and all that kind of stuff, that™s wh
y the generals got into it. And Œ but 
the ran Œ radio was full of 
Goering Œ
 not 
Goering s
, but 
Goebbels
 saying that God 
saved 
Hitler
 and he has Œ he™s Œ has to have a 
s Œ God™s help to let him stay alive 
and all that, otherwise he would Œ but then  wh
en they started Œ exce
pt that when they 
started hanging up the people who were do
ing it, that was at the same time that I 
think the 
Warsaw
 up Œ ghetto uprising was going
 on, I think, so th at Œ 
Q: That was spring of ™43 was the 
Warsaw
 ghetto. 
A: No, then that was the Polish uprising, yeah. 
Q: That™s what I thought, yeah, in ™44. 
A: ™44, an d they were all Œ the newspaper were full of Œ so 
Hitler
 got kind of lost 
someplace. 

Q: Mm-h m, mm-h m, mm-h m.  
A: And they  didn™t want to ad
vertise this idea that there 
is somebody against him, so 
that they wouldn't Œ wouldn™t all co
me together and get rid of him. 
Q: Right, right. 

A: So they Œ they p
ublicize all this uprising and he 
was kind of on th e back burner 
then. 
Q: Did you used to hear 
his speeches on th e radio? 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure

88
A: Yeah, I wa Œ 
Q: What were your Œ what
 were your impressions? 
A: Impressions Œ I hated him already, 
you know, my  impressions weren™t that 
favorable, he was a good dema
gogue and sa Œ I saw him pe
rsonally, too. He couldn™t 
have a per Œ victory parade in
 Wa rsa w
 because
 Warsaw
 was bombed, so he had a 
wi Œ victory parade over
 Poland
 in  
Kraków
, and he was marching there. And 
people were su-supposedly push ed thro ugh 
the streets and th ey were Œ so he would 
see people lined up an d all that kind of stuff. 

Q: Were you lined up to  see him?  

A: Oh, I know because I was upstairs on the 
Œ in the Œ on my uncle™s house, looking 
down from the window. 

Q: You didn™t want
 to go down stairs? 
A: Are you kidding? Are you kidding? Havi
ng seen so many people Œ of your own 
people dead, city ruined and all that? Lite
rally Œ somehow we knew
 he is gonna lose, 
the minute the Americans came in . 
Gisela
(ph) said, it™s gonna be over soon. My  
uncle said, minute the Americans come 
in, it™s gonna be over. And it was over. 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: So you sp ent the rest of the war years 
doing this same work
 with this family ? 
A: Oh yeah.

Q: Any other experiences ther
e that you want to talk abou
t, while you were working 
there? 
A: Well, really nothing. Was a normal 
sa Œ I just loved th e old lady, and Œ 
Q: What was her name? 

A: 
Elsa
(ph). And sh e was from 
Berlin
 and she hated
 No rdhausen
. She married this 
ma Œ she hated little towns and she didn™t
 like the wife of the son because she 
married Œ she had already planned his marri
age and he didn't  marry somebody she 
wanted to marry. So I think 
I was really getting the better 
of this quarrel between the 
two of them, but they of course Œ they Œ th ey
 had Œ they had this 
Œ th ey had th is aunt 
who lost her fiancé in the first war Œ wa
r, and she was working for the Red Cross. 
And she just stopped wo rking th ere, and 
I said, wh -why Œ why? And she says Œ I 
says, cannot see how young people can go to  
war so happy and laugh. Cause she saw 
this Œ she was handing coffee 
to the soldiers, and of cour
se they were waving and 
shouting and singing. And he sa
ys, they don™t know where 
they™re going. They don™t 
know that they™re going to their death. And 
she Œ she says, I just can™t take it. I just 
can™t take young people being butchered. So
 I, to this day I all Œ the father was 

discovered after the war with Œ oh, with an
 English revolver or something, and of 
course that was in East 
Germany, 
and so he was in prison and th en he was sent to 
Siberia
, wh ere he died . And nobody told  me
 Œ everybody knew, and I Œ he was 
accused of having killed me, by 
some woman there. And hi
s mother, who knew that

I was alive, didn™t say one wo
rd  for me to come to his help. After all, this guy set me 
free, instead of sending me 
[indecipherable]
 shot this pistol and that kind of stuff. 
But she Œ there were Gestapo men in the 
house, and Œ and maybe they didn™t want 
any witnesses and so Œ so she got out and 
Œ but she took the st
u Œ children, and she 
told me run, run. And Œ  
Q: No-N ow Œ now, wait a minute. We
™re talking now about liberation? 
A: No Œ 
Q: No. 
A: Œ we™re talking about before that Œ 
well, it was my liberation, because I Œ 
Q: Okay, da Œ can you tell it Œ describe that. 
A: Well, the town was bombed and they 
Œ these people had a ha Œ house in the 
woods, and whenever 
they could escape they
 would go to this house in the woods. 
And of co urse, where everything was bombed,
 they Œ they moved to the woods. And 
I used to Œ and I remember th
at I helped them carry out th
e Œ he had a Œ he had there 
a truck and he used to  take the things 
from the house and from his mother-in-law to 
the Œ course, his mo ther said I™m not movi

brought the things into the house and I th
ink I was gonna Œ a-and they were those

d unifo rms, they were sitting there. And 
Œ or rather, there were Œ there were th
e Gestapo men who al

know what happened , but anyho
w all of a sudden he Œ they 
were talking, blah, blah, 
blah and then he says to me, ah, leave wh
at you™re doin g there and co me out. Bu t he 
also calls the children, the 
girl and the little b oy. And 
we go outside and I see him 
with his revolver. And I said, my gosh, is 
he gonna shoot me or some thing? And he 
said, now, you run and run straight to 
Nordhausen
 so you can see my  mo ther, 
because I promised I™d bring you back, or 
you come back. And Œ 
but watch it. And I 
couldn™t believe it, so I didn™t
 run. And he says run, so my  bullet doesn™t get you. 
And he b Œ of course, he s
hot in the air you know, and I 
run. And that™s how Œ and 
nobody Œ nobody to
ld the police, or the Œ or
 the whatever they had,
 NKVD

whatever they had in those days, that I was alive, that 
[indecipherable]
 his mo ther 
mu st have hated him, or wh atever there wa
s, you know, they we
re scared for their 
own lives, so that™s why th ey
 helped this man. And I would have told them he was 
good to the prisoners and he help ed to f
eed them and Œ and all that, but Œ I could 
have been a good witness for him.  
Q: So you ran back to  his mo ther? 
A: Yeah. And Œ and so Œ and wh ile I was going 
to his mother, I didn™t get there yet, I 
saw this big American tanks coming in . And 
the first soldiers that were coming were 
the black men Œ I mean the Œ 
the f Œ they were black, th
e Œ course they used th em

I pick up the candy and I go, beca
use I was so worried his mother 
and this maid and her servant will be su
ffering, you know, the 
American occupied, 
because there were few houses still standing
 and one Œ theirs was one of them. And I 
get in there and there sit these four Americ
an young soldiers and she speaks English 
with them. And they  giving her, I don™t kno
w what they were eating, or something 
like that, so I didn™t have to
 worry about that, because I 
was worried to death, you 
know, what on Œ on earth™s going to  happe
n to those two old women. There was a 
third one, she was a nurse, too, and she wa
s the nurse to this ol
d lady, but she also 
was a nurse in a gyneco logist™s office or so
mething. So all thes
e three old ladies, I 
said oh my  God, wh at™s going to happen 
to them? Nothing happened. They  were 
taken care of by the Americans, so Œ 

Q: You still didn™t speak English, right? 
A: No. 
Q: So th en what did you do wh en you saw them? 

A: Well, when I saw them Œ oh, I spok
e fren Œ oh yeah , now there was a Polish 
soldier Œ I mean, an American who was Po
lish, you know, and he came looking in 
too, looking for girls. And 
he has this, you know, a weddin
g band on his hand. I said, 
oh 
[indecipherable]
 that™s how married men are. We
ll, anyhow. And th Œ but there

were people who far Œ couple of them 
spoke French and the rest was in sign 
language. 
Q: Did you feel liberated, and Œ 
A: Oh, I did, my  goodness gracious, the mi
nute I saw that truck, I felt liberated. 
Q: What was that like for you? 
A: You can™t really describe it. You can abso
lutely not describe it.
 I™m so happy that 
I lived through and I Œ and I got to this Œ 
that this mo me nt has come. See ya Œ that 
time you didn™t count how many people had to
 die to bring you freedom. You didn™t 

think about a grave of the 
American soldiers, of the ones who have fallen or 
wounded, and Œ and they wa
s blinded or wo uld spend ye
ars and years in all those 
hospices. You don™t think ab out that, all you 
think is about yourself and how they 
brought you freedom, but at wh at cost, yo
u know? Y-You didn't even think about it. 
But that was a glorious mo ment. Just the fact
 that you surv ived  and that you feel this 
Œ course we all knew 
America™s
 gonna win anyhow, so 
yeah, especially with 
Gisela
(ph) you know, who was sa
ying me Œ I™m telling you, once the American 
comes Œ come, the war is over. And it was 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: How did you know that onc
e the American Œ what did 
America
 mean to you? 
A: Well, they always meant 
they™d always bring you free
dom. In the first World War 
they brought freedom, a
nd there was President
 Wilson
, who Œ who ha Œ with  his 

points, he made independent 
Poland
 and all that. And so of course, I mean
, America

was always like a land of freedom, land 
of liberty and y-
you knew that once 
Americans get here,
 Hitler
 will b e finished. Of course 
you never knew that for sure, 
because he had developed that 
V-1s, V-2 
sooner, you never know how it would have 
ended. 
Q: Then wh at did you do? 

A: What did I do? Well, I Œ 

Q: Did you stay with the older women? 
A: No, I couldn™t stay because the Œ 
immediately the Americans issu ed a Œ 
Americans issued a proclamation that all 
POWs, 
foreign 
POWs
 and slave workers 
have to report Œ guess where? To 
Dora
. They Œ out of 
Do ra
 they made this transit 
camp for all liberated people, so that™s 
how I really knew that gas chambers and 
hospital and Œ and th at™s where I really
 learned about what was going on in 
Dora
 
before. And I stayed there. 
Q: What Œ what did that do to
 you wh en you rea
lized what Œ the extent of what was 
going on? 

A: When I first 
[indecipherable]
 thank God it wasn™t me , because that™s what you 
always think, you know? And th
en there™s this Œ this enorm
ity of this crime w as just 
hards to grasp. And Œ 

Q: Did people talk Œ or did you ta
lk about it with 
the other Polish Œ 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure  
February 2, 2001 

 

 
 
95
A: When  they Œ they  talk. And Œ and th
ere were Œ you know, 
wh erever you went 
there was something, see what we™re together
 with Œ there were 
still the s Œ s Œ the 
survivors of the concentration camps we
re the people who were sick and th ey 
couldn™t finish them off, they le
ft them in this hospital, or
 took some of them inside 
the galleries and that™s why the people from 
N o rd ha u s en
 could not escape the 
bombing and be saved, because they didn™t
 want to say what they  were doing in 
those underground tu nnels, and the Œ all the de
ad people there. An
d so they had dead 
on both side. And it™s Œ it Œ it™s really hard
 to believe, you know, and you just say 
how come me? How Œ how come I am aliv
e and th e many thousan ds died, you ask 
yourself, what am I for here, why have I be
en left? And you have
 this question, you 
know, what am I gonna do, how am I gonna repay all this liberty? That™s why I 
always give to the Œ to the American war 
veterans, the blinded veterans and all this. 

And that™s probably  one of the reason why I work  here, too. Maybe to atone for the 

things that I could have done
 and didn™t do to save the Jews, that I could. And I may 
be Œ of course, I was too young
 to do anything, but I re 
Œ could have done mo re. But 
then you Œ you wonder, how co me I, and I bet you ev ery survivor is asking the same 

question. They say, wh at does God have 
in store for me to have let me live? 
Q: So th en you Œ you went
, and how long did you stay in this transit camp? 
A: Oh, let™s see, that w as the year 
Œ it ga Œ was the co Œ camp  was called 
Heilbronn
. 
Those were the displaced persons who were not from Œ oh no, and then in 
Do ra

there was a Œ here is a convoy transport going to 
Poland
, and those of you who don™t 
want to go to 
Poland
 can go west. And of course th
at was the time where, from what 
I have heard from the Russians, an the 
Uk rainians, how horrible Russian and the 
Soviet system is, I said, even
 worse than the Germ
ans, than the Nazi
s even at war Œ I 
mean, they are just as the N
azis if not worse. And so, not 
going to  go into any Soviet 
occupied 
Poland
, so I decided then I™m going west.

This is tape number three, 
side
 B
, and you were talking 
about how you didn™t want to go back  to 
Poland
, that 
you wanted to go west and th
at Œ and I had aske
d you about your 
parents, did you 
not want to go back to 
be with your family. 
A: All my  Œ oops Œ no, I™ve Œ I didn™t even
 think about my family at that time, 
especially under the Soviets, I wasn™t going to
 Œ to fall into the clutches of any Œ of 
any system like that any more, so I just wa
nted to go west. And I went west, and I 
went to the Œ this 
DP
 camp in
 Heilbronn
. I work for them in the 
office there. I really 
started peeling potatoes again in a kitche
n, but then there was somebody coming 
through the kitchen, and somebody mu st ha
ve told them that I know languages and 
all that kind of stuff, and they were aski
ng for my name, and I 
pretended I didn™t

hear anything, cause I wasn™t going to 
be in volved  in anything else. And then  
somebody pointed to me and says, that™s
 she and says wh at are you doing here 
peeling potatoes when we need help in th
is Polish office? I mean, th e Pole Œ they 
have Germans and Dutch and all that, and 
Lithuanians and Latvians, but the Polish 
liaison officer has no help. So  wh at are yo
u doing here? And so I got out and started 
working for them. And then the 
UNRRA
, the Œ the ur Œ Un ited Nations Refugee 
organization, the director said to me, what
 would you have been doing if you were Œ 
if there hadn™t been no war? And I said oh 
I™ll be Œ probably finish my  Œ going to the 
university. And he says, well you know wh at? The 
UNRRA
 is paying fo r education 
of candidates who are coo Œ acceptable. Woul
d you like to go to school? And I say, 
yeah, I would like to go to 
school. But I still stayed in 
Heilbronn 
and I would go to 
Œ I went to the Œ to the ga Œ 
Johns Œ 
to 
John Œ Wolfgang Goethe
 University in 
Frankfurt. 
And Œ but this going back
 and forth was just a 
little bit too much, so I 
got a room. I was going there for food, beca
use I already had the room. I got a room 
assigned, but I n Œ I need f-food.  

Q: You had a room assigned in 
Frankfurt
? 
A: Yeah, but I had to have food, too,
 so I was going b
ack and forth to 
Heilbronn
, 
getting th is food. And th en somebody in sc
hool sa Œ I was so sleepy and I said, geez, 

I just hate Œ 

Q: How far was the distance?

A: Well, I just don™t remember how fa
r, but was quite awhile, because it was Œ 
Q: By train, or bus? 
A: By train, by train. And somebody says
, well, you don™t have 
to go, you can join 
our camp, the displaced person camp in 
Da rmsta d t
 or someplace, and we go once a 
week Œ oh yeah, and I belong to  a Polish 
fraternity. And th ey said, the hola Œ we Œ 

one or two people from the fra
ternity all go every week a
nd they  bring the fo od for 
everybody and then  you don™t have to go and 
take Œ do this journey. So that™s why I 
quit this camp in 
Heilbronn
 and came to stay in 
Frankfurt
 to Œ til the time came to 
emigrate.  

Q: How did that come about? 
A: Well, everybody Œ I Œ I think it™s the Ca
tholic charities Œ no, Catholic refugee Œ 
Catholic Œ 
Q: Relief services? 

A: Relief. That™s wh ere yo-you signed up and 
they were looking fo
r places for you. 
And I got this sponsor, and I was a domestic
. Because that was the fa Œ the people 
who said they were from
 Wellesley, Wellesley
 hills. And somebody said, oh, there™s 
this famous school in 
Wellesley. 
And then Œ there is abso
lutely no way for me to 
Wellesley 
on mydomestic salary a

come to 
Saint Louis
, maybe you can get 
a job here and Œ 
Q: Okay, wa-wait a minute, let™s back
 up a little bit. So you™re in 
Germany 
an d th e 
Catholic Relief Services arra
nges for you to go to the 
United States. 
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: And when did you leave? 

A: Oh, I think it was 1950. 
Q: Mm-hm.  
A: Was ni Œ was June, I think, 1950 
[indecipherable]
 June. 
Q: So you are almost 26 
by now, 26 years old? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: When you were in 
Frankfurt
, what were you studying? 
A: Oh, I really stu Œ I want to have medi
cine, because in the camps everybody said 
only mechanics and doctors stay alive. But 
since I kept fainting when I smelled this 
formaldehyde, the doctor said you™re not 
Œ you™ll never make it 
in medicine, go into 
philology
 or something like that. And so I went
 to study rome Œ romance languages. 
Q: In Œ in 
Frankfurt. 

A: Mm-hm. 
Q: And did you help  out any of
 the chaplains in Œ in the 
DP 
camps? 
A: Oh yeah, that was before
 there, that was Œ that was right after the liberation.

Q: What Œ what did you do then ? 
A: Oh, I just went with them from lo Œ to
 Œ right after the liber
ation there was still 
some of the 
No rdha user
(ph)
 Œ Nordhauser
(ph)
 
concentration camp inmates living, 
but they were sick and they were dying, so 
the chaplain said to 
go and talk to them, 
give them the last unction, or whatever. 

Q: What was your ra Œ role? 

A: I was just translating. And so that™s 
what I was doing. And I really liked that 
work, to tell you the truth. 
Q: Why Œ why did you like it? 

A: Well, because we™re helping people and ju
st Œ it was Œ was really Œ it was really 
so touching, where these dying almo st pe
ople would grab the soldiers hands, you 

know. And they were dying ev
en more than did before 
because the soldiers were 
giving th em candy and stuff like that, and he
re was somebody who didn™t eat for 10 
days, and you can imagine wh at happens. An
d then th ey™re Œ they were not allowed 
to give them anything. But just to see them
 there, you know, and being able to shake 

the liberators hand, it was so touching and those poor kids didn
't know what to do 
and they  got kissed on their ha
nds, and it was Œ it was just Œ it was hard to describe 
the feeling that™s Œ that you had. A-And ho
w it was glorious in a way and it was so 
sad in the other. And Œ but then  the Americ
ans took th e ones who were still alive to 
different houses and hospitals and all that, 
so the ones got saved. But there was not

101
mu ch to be done to the dyi
ng ones except to give them 
a benediction and that™s it. 
There mu st have been  Jewish prisoners too,
 because there were ra
bbis still. I mean, 
there were a chaplain Œ I mean, what do 
they call them, rabbi 
chaplains? Mosaic 
faith. Mosaic 
[indecipherable]
. Yeah, because I remember
 a couple of times you 
know, they would Œ they  all had some thi
ngs that they would 
rec Œ be recognized, 
you know. And they  were just 
looking at the prisoners and ju st shake their hands, so 
there must have been Je
wish prisoners too.  
Q: This was in 
Dora
? 
A: No, th at was already in 
No rdha usen
. 
Q: In
 Nordhausen
. 
A: 
Nord hausen, 
cause 
No rdha usen
 consid ers Œ 
Nord hausen
 was considered Œ they 
Œ they call it vacationland, but
 what they did, out of 
Do ra
 they sent the prisoners 
who were dying, cause they didn™t have 
enough room there, so they would send 
them to 
Nordhausen
 
Boelcke Kaserne
 where they just drop
 them there and wait til 
they die. And th ey were na Œ they  were
 not counting th e dead, they  were counting 

the living. And that™s how the Americans ca
me in, na Œ alls you see is this row of 
dead people, you know, because that™s how 
the Œ in this German order they always 
lined them up very nicely, 
and so that™s when the Ge
rman Œ when the Americans 
came and saw it.  

Q: And you saw this ba Œ 
Kaserne
? 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure  
February 2, 2001 

 

 
 
102
A: Yeah, yeah. I did see it. But that was 
already after the Americans came, when Œ 
when  the Americans came, when they starte
d. The first thing that told me about Œ 
who told me shi Œ this Mr. 
Ratzfeldt
(ph) came back and he was aw fully Œ and I say, 
what™s happening to  him? And I said to
 Gisela
(ph), why don™t you go and see what 
happening in this 
Boelcke Kaserne
 in 
Nordhausen
. And she told me, well, there™s 
nothing happens, they™re not counting the 
dead, they™re countin
g the living, cause 
they have these rows of Œ of dead  people 
lined up. And that™s what Œ she says, that™s 
what he saw. And of course, somebody™s go
nna have to pay for it. So that™s how Œ 
Q: And so you, you yourself went
 with the chapla
ins to these Œ 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Œ to this 
Kaserne
. And Œ 
A: Yeah, wherever were the Œ the ones wh
o were still alive. But I wasn™t going to 
say that I have no foreign languages, you know
, but then I said Œ 
I rememb er the last 
time I li-lied, I said dear God,
 fo rgive me all the lies and bad things I have done. But 
when the war is over, I shall not lie Œ I sh
all lie no mo re, steal no mo re or deceive 
anyone. And then when
 the Œ oh yeah, and while I was 
liberated I see this man with 
all these fiv e suitcases on him. And he 
was the dentist, a friend of the sa Œ
 
Ratzfeldt
(ph). And he used Œ and he
 had my  Œ he healed my  
tooth. And he said to 
me, now if it still hurts, come the next day 
because I am leaving.
 And ho Œ he left 
and he comes back and I say, I help you
. And I hardly could lift what he was

103
carrying, is all this stuff that he used, fa
lse teeth and all. And I get to his house and 
there™s Americans stan ding in front of it, and he says 
ra us kra u ts
 and all that. And I 
say, is there anybody who sp
eaks Polish, but the Œ no, is
 there anybody who speaks 
French? And they say yeah
, there™s Œ and he says,
 voulez vous coucher avec mo i
? 
And I say, and I don™t want that kind of 
French , I want somebody who I can tell him. 
And then comes Œ they call up this Polish 
guy Œ I mean, Polish American. And said, 
what do you do with  this kraut? And I sa
id, this is a dentist who is a very good 
[indecipherable]
 slave to Œ we didn™t call our slave laborers then Œ to everybody, 
very fine wo rkers and Œ and Œ an d Œ an
d all she wants to do is put his tools 
down stairs. And he says no, this is a head
quarters, cause there were few houses there 
were still standing. We don™t 
want that. And I say, but he was such a good man and 
all that. So anyhow, so he 
call the sergeant or somebody 
else, and he says, now lo ok 
in his junk. So he look in hi
s thing, and he says okay, you can tell him he can get that 
Œ put that downstairs. And th
en get out of here. So he put down his dentistry stuff. 
And he says, and precisely who are you? 
You a kraut too? And I said no, I am 
Polish. He says, well, show me a Œ show me a 
I.D.
, and I say, I don™t have any. How 
do we know? You could be a kraut hiding
, pretending you are Po lish. And th e 
dentist says, oh I know, in my office there 
is a Œ I have an  index card  and it tells 
there, you know, a nationality. Well, the 
guy says to me, well next time, don™t go 
anyplace without an
 I.D
. And I said, where I™m going to
 get any? And th at™s when 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure

104
he said, well, there™s g o nna be a camp in 
Dora
 for all slave laborers and I have to go 
there and get an 
I.D.
 That™s how it happened then. 
Q: Hm. 
A: And that™s it. 
Q: So th en, skipping fo rward to  1950, y-y
ou had these arrangements made for you to 
go to  Œ 

A: Mm-hm. 
Q: Œ the 
United States. 
A: And I Œ and I could choose, since this
 was international refugee organization, 
which meant that they both Œ 
that they had to ship from 
the navy, but everybody on 
that board  had to wo rk to ma
intain the ship. So
 if you were on one of them, you had 
to work. And was a cra Œ and I said I™m 
never again going to  know any language, 
I™ve seen enough of it and Œ 

Q: I-I-I-I d-don™t mean to interrupt, but 
I wanted to ask y
ou, you were in 
Germany
 
for five Œ a-almost fiv e years after the war. 

A: Mm-hm. 

Q: How did that feel to  be in 
Germ any
, knowing that the Germans Œ 
A: Awful, that™s if Œ i-it felt Œ  

Q: Œ knowing th at the Germans, 
you know, began the war and so Œ 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure  
February 2, 2001 

 

 
 
105
A: Yeah, well, it felt like a land of egy Œ 
Eg ypt
. A land of slavery 
and you want to 
get out of it. That™s how ca Œ I can Œ that™s the best comp arison I can give you. And 
so that™s how I got out. 
Q: Did you keep trying to ge
t out during those five years? 
A: Oh yeah, everybody did. 
Q: What kinds of 
things did you do? 
A: Well, wif Œ really, to begin with, ever
ybody signed up that she wants to emi g rate. 
But then, you know, there were
 so Œ no, th e Catholics really had a Œ Po lish Catholics 
had a very little chance of getting anypla
ce. There was this Lutheran, this 
organization, Qu akers and this and that, y
ou know, so they Œ th
e Quakers took care 
of the Œ but the Quak ers we
re wonderful, took care 
of the sick and old and 
tuberculosis people. But there was very 
little Œ that™s why I only got to be a 
domestic, because that™s the only job that wa
s possible, and I only got it because the 
parish priest, or the pastor of that parish was a fa Œ Father 
Lloyd. 
And Father 
Lloyd
 
was very active in Œ during 
[indecipherable]
 times and was a very great friend of 
the Poles, and he convinced hi
s parish that they ought to 
at least take one Catholic 
refugee, and that™s was me. 
Q: When  did the enormity of the numbe
r of victims become a Œ when did you 
realize, or when did you become aware 
of the enormity of the millions upon 
millions? 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure  
February 2, 2001 

 

 
 
106
A: Well, of course in the first place it™
s Œ you know, everybody was talking ab out it 
and Œ but then really, the enormity of 
it I found here in the Holocaust museum. 
When you see all the documents of the Gestapo, 
[indecipherable]
 Gestapo and 
[indecipherable]
 Gestapo and 
Posner
 Gestapo, and 
Warsaw, Kraków 
and all that. 
That™s when you really
 know how many perished. 
Q: So in 1946 and 
™47 you still weren 't 
aware, and ™48. 
A: I wasn™t aware of the massacre. I was 
aware that people died. And of course I Œ 
once I saw Œ I saw the 
N o rd ha u s en
 and Œ and I really learned that in 
Dora , 
how 
many died and Œ and in 
Nordhausen
 really, but during th at time I had practically no 
idea what was going on. So it was after th
e liberation that I really, I mean now 
discovered the enormity of that Œ of the war.  

Q: So now you™re getting to  go
 on the boat to come to the 
United States. 
A: Yeah, and on the boat we fe Œ 

Q: What was the name  of your boat? 
A: 
Blatchford
. General 
Blatchford
. And it™s Œ I had to choose, since I spoke these 
languages, they asked for a translator. And Œ 
Q: But you knew English by now? 
A: Well, a little bit, because I went to school in  
Frankfort
 where I learned English. 
And Œ not very good, but I kn
ew it. And when I Œ yeah, I 
was supposed to be a cabin 
leader. And to me a cabin is like four pe
ople all Œ I was once on a Œ on a ship  and it 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure

107
had a cabin, I thought it was four people 
[indecipherable]
. And I come down, I says 
what is this? I think it was kind of s-six 
year Œ I forgot the numb ers where you were 
supposed to be, but after al Œ this navy
 man says down , down , down . And I go down, 
it™s the last floor. And he says the number, 
I forgot what it was, 68 or something. 
And I see this man coming down and they  we
re tol Œ they told 
us never to have 
anything to do with the navy men. The 
sailors, I mean. And I say, what are you 
doing here? Not supposed to be with the 
civilians. And he says, and what are you 
doing here? And I said, well, I™m looking fo
r a cabin here, and I never Œ he says, 
can™t you ev en read? And I say Œ I said, but
 this isn™t a cabin. I says, it™s huge. I 
mean, it was a room, and he says, what do yo
u expect, this is army ship, and carried 
soldiers to 
Euro pe
. And I™m telling you, it was as bi
g as from here over there. Next 
to the machine room, with all this noise. A
nd I said, I was supposed
 to work here for 
somebody. And he said, oh, so and so, and he
 looks at me, says, well, you™re just too 
small. And I say, well. And then  I say, ex
cuse me, but I™ll go up. I says, I don™t want 
this one. He says, well, if you™d rather cl
ean toilets. And I said, what do you mean? 
He said, well, cause you have to wo rk at so
mething. You either work for me, or you 
work toilets, or cook in a kitc
hen. But he didn™t say cook 
in a kitchen, he said wash 
the toilets. And that™s how I start and I la
ter married this guy, but anyhow, that™s 
how I got here, on this 
Blatchworth
(ph). And of course ev
erybody was throwing up. 
That™s how I really got to know him, be
cause everybody was th
rowing up and I was

throwing up too, and he says, here™s 
black coffee and a apple. And I was doing 
nothing, but he would bring me this apple 
and this black coffee. Because there were 
lots of kids in this big room wh ere I was 
this leader, you know, 
there were mothers, 
fathers who Œ no, there were only mother
s, but Œ men weren™t supposed to be 

coming there, but they were coming still. 
And I Œ and Œ and they were all lying 
around and the poor kids, there was nobo
dy to  take care of the kids, cause the 
mothers were all throwing up. 
For some reaso n , kids didn™t.
 And so it was my  job to 
do so mething with the kids, so Œ and he 
was helping me doing th at, so that was Œ 
maybe that™s why I liked him. 

Q: How long did the voyage take? 
A: I think a week, it was Œ oh, eight days.  
Q: Was it fi-filled with all d-displaced people? 

A: Only disp laced persons, except I told hi
m that on my Œ that I would take this job 
with the two Œ there were 260 women, I th
ink, or something like that, was a huge 
number. But I said, I take this job if you 
don™t put any Polish people in there. 
Q: Why did you say that? 

A: Why? Because they were Ukrainians
, Byelorussians, Russians, who else? 
Q: Any Jewish people? 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure  
February 2, 2001 

 

 
 
109
A: There were Jewish peop
le, but they got out on acco
unt of the food. They™d 
insisted that they have th
eir own, they don™t be mixe
d with other people because 
there will be the trouble with kosher kitchen. 
Q: S-So they didn™t live in your cabin? 
A: No, th ey didn™t live in my  Œ an-and no 
Polish people lived 
in Œ I mean no Œ no 
Poles lived in
 my cabin. 
Q: Why? 
A: I was with Ukrainians, Lithuanians, Latv
ians, because I could never be accused of 
being Œ  
Q: Favorite? 
A: Yeah, to favor somebody of my own. So  that way I avoid all the trouble.  
Q: But that wa Œ that was your id ea? Or it was Œ 

A: It was 
[indeciphera ble]
 idea, it was my idea. And they were always complaining, 
the child was always complain
ing to me that Œ that the 
Jews were calling them worse 
than the Nazis, becau
se everybody brought 
like little cucumbers, or like sour pickles, 
or something like that because Œ a-and a 
herring, cause somebody told them that 
when  you travel and gets Œ 
you don™t get seasick if you 
have those things on you. 
And you know th at once you were in in a ca
mp, you know how to 
stash things away. 
And of co urse on a moving ship, a plague can just develop in no time, so we™re 

trying to get rid of this stuff. 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure  
February 2, 2001 

 

 
 
110
Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. 
A: And of course can you im
agine when oh Œ you
 got Œ sometimes you paid for the 
stuff you had and you ha
d to get rid of it. So lots of 
times they would say oh, you™re 
just worse than the Nazi 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: Had you come into contact with 
Jews in Œ from 1945 to  ™50 in the 
DP
 camps? 
A: Let me see. Oh yeah, b
ecause I work in this Polish 
consulate and Œ and i Œ Jews, 
in order to be Œ emig Œ to emigrate any plac
e had to Œ I was in the legal office of the 
consul, according to those lang
uages again, and in order 
to emigrate someplace you 
had to have a birth certificate. And in orde
r to have a birth certificate, you had to 
have some kind of official Œ official place 
to ask for it for you. And so that™s how I 
ca-came in touch, cause they were 
[indecipherable]
 Jews were from 
Poland
, so the 
ones who surviv e need a birth certificate, or Œ 

Q: But did you socialize 
or you ju st met them?  
A: I only socialized with one, because in 
school, at the university there was nobody 
and oh well, later on when I got 
to the stateside, but not in 
Germany
. 
Q: No, no, I meant in 
Germany
. 
A: No, in  
Germany
 I 
[indecipherable]
 more friends who Œ whom I know from this 
Œ from the fraternity. Although th
ey Œ any Polish citizen coul
d belong to it, but they 
had their own. Bu t the rabbis took care of
 it that nobody gets contaminated by

[indecipherable]
 take this out because I don™t think th at™s 
[indecipherable]
 was 
very nice. 
Q: So, as you say, th e Jewish pe
ople had th eir own social groups. 
A: Yeah, mm-hm. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: And so Œ besides the Œ what is this, Joint? 

Q: It™s the Joint Distribution Committee. 
A: The Joint Distribution Agen
cy, they were really supe 
Œ they were really helping 
them in the displaced camp
 Œ camps, you know, and Œ 
Q: 
[indecipherable]
 you were black market in 
th-the di-displaced camp s, 
DP
 
camps? 
A: No. I wasn™t aware of it, but there must
 have been, and I™m quite sure that there 
was. No, because lots of times I w ent to 
the police to translate 
some thing, you know. 
Q: Did you get paid for this, or this was just Œ 
A: No. 
Q: Œ to get room and board? 

A: Room and board. 
Q: So you Œ you Œ did you 
have any money with you wh en you were on the boat 
coming to the 
United States? 
A: I think I had 30 dollars.

Q: Given by the Catholic 
charity, Catholic relief? 
A: Yeah, yeah. 
Q: How long was your voyage? 
A: I think was seven days, was 
[indecipherable]
 it was awfully Œ I know it was Œ 
the sea wasn™t very quiet and I was oops, all the time. 
Q: And where did you dock? 

A: 
Boston. 
In
 Bo sto n . 
Q: And Œ and Œ and who met you? 

A: Well, nobody met me. I was left there 
stand Œ sitting on my su
itcases. Everybody 
else after we Œ the ships we-went Œ our suitcases were taken 
down  and ev erybody 
else was gone and I was still sitting there. 
And here comes this girl from the Catholic 

charity and she says, give me the telephone
 number of your sponsor and I will call 
him to see what happens. Well, what happ
ens is that they se
nd out a chauffeur to 
pick me up. But Œ oh, oh fina
lly she says to me, this girl from the Catholic charities 
who was Œ spoke Polish, she to
ok me to the little red bar or
 restaurant in the place 
there, and she left me there while she went to call. And she says, well, they said that 

they Œ and she calls again, cause nobody ca
me to pick me up. Sh e says, but he is 
there, we send a chauffeur there. Well,
 anyhow, all I knew about American 
chauffeur is from American films, you know
, they lo ok in those uniforms and all 
that. And Œ but then  I see this guy coming 
back and forth, you know, civilian, and 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure  
February 2, 2001 

 

 
 
113
then she talks to some
body at th-the counter there. 
And then he comes to me, and I 
said, oh, mu st be it, and he says Œ I say, are you from the 
Cronin s
? And he says 
yeah. And I say, you don™t lo Œ well, obvi
ously you don™t look it,
 but anyhow Œ he 
says Œ she said to me, you don™t look like a 
greenhorn, or whatever he called me , you 
know? He expect me to have a babushka on 
or something like th at and here I was, 
pretty we-w ell dressed, you know, kind of 
elegant, cause I always liked to dress up, 
no matter where I was, which I was sorryfor, because it was a dusty. But anyhow, 
he went home to change, to  look elegant. That™s why it 
took Œ has taken him so long 
to pick me up. And I finally got to the 
Cronins
. 
Q: And who was this family? 

A: Oh, th ey owned an  apartment ho Œ house in Œ in 
Wa lth a m
, and th e man was an 
invalid. And they were an elderly couple
 and they had two so
ns and one daughter, 
and they needed help
. And I was very deceived becaus
e I signed the paper that I will 
not take a place of an American, a working place, a job from an American. B u t when 

I got there, there was this black cook, or
 whatever, and after a few days she says, 
well, I want to show you ev erything, how 
you Œ what to do in  this house, because 
I™m leaving, sadly. And I said, what for? 
And she says well, because you are here. I 
almo st dropped dead , cause I thought I™d be
 dragged to  jail for taking aw ay a work  
from Œ workplace from her, you k
now. But anyhow, that was in Œ one surp rise and 
the second one I say was 
Sarah,
 when I™m in 
Bo sto n
 I™m gonna come and visit you, 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure

114
and she gave me the ad dress.
 And then wh en  I showed  it 
to this Œ in the meantime I 
Œ this Polish Catholic charities person, she says
 oh no, you can™t go there, that™s a j Œ 
that™s a black quarter. And I said, so what? 
I had no id ea about this black situation. 
So that™s another story. 
Q: Tell me what it was like for you to get 
off the boat and put your foot on American 
soil? 

A: Well, I was still Œ it wasn™t very s-
sa Œ secure, because I was still a little Œ 
Q: Seasick? 

A: Œ seasick, so at that time Œ  

Q: Did you really realize you were in the 
United States? 
A: No, I didn™t. I didn™t and especially
 because Œ and I was especially worried  
because when we got on the 
ship these people were say 
Œ some of the sailors were 
saying, oh th ere™s another b
unch taking American jobs. And here I come to this 
house, when I take this job away from this
 Œ oh, so sh e was old and she could have 
re Œ she said she was happy to retire now
. But this whole idea, you know, that I 
really didn™t feel Œ after awhile, of c
ourse I came to my self, you know, I went 
straight and I slept, I d on™
t know, I think 12 hours after 
that, I Œ but I had to start 
working again, so it wasn™t Œ I didn't realiz
e really that I was here til Œ til I started 
going to  school in 
Sa int Louis
, and th en we Œ in school 
we were together, we were 
talking about democracy and all 
t h at in this history class,  and we were at some Swiss 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure

115
Œ we had some students from 
Switze rland
 and th ey said, oh there™s no demo cracy in 
America
, you d Œ you treat the blac
ks like dirt, and all that kind of stuff, and I said, 
well it™s easy for you to  say because you d
on™t have any Œ you don™t have your Œ 
you™re foreigners. And well, to tell you th
e truth, isn™t polical Œ socially it wasn™t 
what I expected. For some reason I exp
ected democracy to 
be, you know, some 
magic that makes people happy.

Beginn ing Tape Four, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of the 
United Sta tes 
Holocaust Memorial Museum 
volunteer collection interview with 
Kristina Belfoure. 
This is tape number four, 
side
 A. 
And befo re we go on ab out 
your experiences in the 
United States, 
I just 
wanted to  ask you another question about the 
DP
 camps. Did you have any contact 
with Jewish survivors, and if so did you 
feel any co nnection to  them, or did you see 
any difference? 
A: There were absolutely no Jewish 
D Œ 
displaced persons because they were in  a 
separate camp. And so Œ but I knew some fri
ends that once in awhile I would meet, 
but they were just in different locations 
and ju Œ only once in awhile I would see 
them, they would co me and visit, but that was 
[indecipherable]
 or I go and visit. 
But otherwise we had no Œ since we all ha
d to have passes to leave the camp, you 
couldn™t leave the camp without the pass a
nd all that, and you 
have to prove why 
you have to go and all this so
rt of thing. And I always lied and I said, well, I have to 
see family, I found somebody, and all th
at kind of stuff. But otherwise you just 
wouldn™t get the pass. So I Œ it was difficult rea
lly to Œ to Œ to go 
by train or an yplace 
like that. It was easy, it was like another 
camp except that it was so called free camp, 

but it was also very limited. Course youweren™t afraid somebody is gonna shoot 
you, but I mean, i-it Œ  it was a difficult lif
e. It was a li Œ it was a Œ it was like in 
Egypt
 waiting fo r getting out 
into the free land.  

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure  
February 2, 2001 

 

 
 
117
Q: To the promised land. Bu t when  you did 
see those few Jewish survivors, did Œ di 
Œ could you tell the difference between th
e Jewish survivors and the non-Jewish 
survivors? 
A: Well, I never could tell the differen
ce between Jewish people anyhow. I me an, 
yeah, I lived with them and 
they didn™t look 
like any difference to me. Of course I 
knew that her father use Œ had lo ng beard an d 
[indecipherable]
 all that and th at Œ 
you know, like Hasidic Jews. 
But young people I could 
never tell the difference, 
cause especially in school we were all in 
uniforms. And you couldn™t tell, I mean it™s 
just absolutely 
unpossible
 for me to tell the difference. 
Q: Now let™s move ahead. You said you came to the 
United States 
in 1950 and you 
did say what you were doing in  
those years from 1945 to 1950, we went thro ugh th at 
already. But did you try to 
get out earlier? Why 
did you, in a sense, wait until 1950? 
Was that the first time yo
u were allowed to leave? 
A: No, I Œ that™s Œ that was the first oc
casion and I wouldn™t have even gotten out 
because while I was th e Œ after the war I wo
rked for a friend, rather a boyfriend of 
my  aunt was working fo r the Po lish consulate in 
Frankfurt am Main
 when I was 
work ing to school, and somehow I met him 
on the concert, and we were Œ were 
coming down from some concert 
and there was this queen of 
Holland
 or 
Belg ium
, I 
didn™t Œ don™t rememb er which one, and she™
s the Œ was the woman with this fat legs 
and we were laughing at, sayi
ng that™s she got a piano legs. And there was a bunch 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure  
February 2, 2001 

 

 
 
118
of Po lish officers walking behind us. And th
ey say oh, you Po les. And I say, yeah, 
you too. And we look at them
, and see if they have a s Œ a Polish communist signs, 
or the Polish 
Lo ndon
 signs, cause you can tell. And 
one of them asked, wh ere are 
you from? And I said, I™m from 
Kraków
. And he said, oh I know 
Kraków
 very 
well, this captain said, I had a girlfriend ther
e. And he turned out 
to be my  aunt. And 
then we were starting talking, he said, 
oh you speak languages? An d I said oh yeah, I 
study languages. And he said oh, could you
 work  for me a couple hours? I don™t Œ I 
need somebody to translate and write Ge
rman letters. And I said okay, but I was 
foolish, because you see, I was in the 
Lo ndon
 supported fraternity and I was an anti-
communist so to say, and all of a sudden 
Œ but I did this because
 he was my friend Œ 
my aunt™s boyfriend. And then he was in 
a car accident, was killed. So after he was 
killed, this Judge
 Shanteski
(ph) who took over the le
gal department says oh my  
God, he left me with so many Œ so many 
letters, correspondence that I Œ could you 
work for me? So I says, but I go to school, 
and I cannot give you mu ch time, but just 
maybe a few hours. And so  he Œ I did wo rk
, and of course when the time came Œ by 
the time I g o t this certificate I have to come
 to the immi gration office, and so when  
they learned that I work ing for a consul
ate and for the Polish Trade and Commerce 
later on, well somebody told me, don™t work
 for the consulate because they might 
take you back to 
Poland
 or persecute your family if
 you don™t go back, and th ey  
switched me to this new office, commerce 
and trade representative™s office. And I 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure  
February 2, 2001 

 

 
 
119
was there and I really stopped going to  school
 because he had so mu ch work , so I s Œ 
interrupted my studies. And the meantim
e I g o t my papers to come to the 
immigratio n office. Well, when they Œ 
but I did have some friends who were 
Americans, and also military personnel, and I 
Œ I went with them, or rather they went 
with me to this office. And 
of course there is this gro
up of people sitti
ng and asking 
me, did you get paid  for the Œ no, this man,
 this captain says, but she work for the 
Americans, she 
work for the 
CIC
. No, it was called different in those days, it wasn™t 
CIC
, it was this something intelligence serv
ice. And they ask me, oh did you Œ oh 
yeah, and this friend of mine said ma Œ re
-remember th at when sh
e has to go to the 
States
 that you vouch for her that she work  fo
r the Americans. And so he says well Œ 
just then somebody who was asking me sa
ys, well did you get money for it? And I 
said, why should I have gotten money fo r it?
 I mean, I Œ I didn™t like the Soviets and 
I didn™t like the Polish government, and that
 was it. And that™s Œ I didn™t do anything 
outrageous, all I did is translated stuff. 
And Œ but I almost got rejected for the 
emigration, but then  all of a sudden I got this call and this lady says there™s 

somebody wanting to talk to 
you. And I said, who on earth can it be? Ba Œ she didn't  
understand the name. It turned
 out to be the boss of th
is intelligence service, who 
says, don™t worry, your papers have been cl
eared. And he said, you work  for us and I 
just Œ only by ch ance did he 
come across my  papers. And he says, I just by chance 
got to your files and I saw th
is rejection and I Œ and he 
says, you™re all cleared up 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure  
February 2, 2001 

 

 
 
120
now. So I was all cleared up and the people at 
Wellesley 
had to wait for me like six 
months, because I was supposed to  come 
and all of a sudden I was stopped and now 
I™m going again, so Œ any Œ like they
 say, alls well that ends well. 
Q: You had mentioned just 
earlier when you first sa 
Œ saw these Polish military 
people, you were walking along, you Œ you
 Œ how could you tell they were not 
Polish communists, but they were Polish, 
Londo n
 affiliated? 
A: Because they had different
 Œ they had the Po
lish eagle with the crown on it, the 
London 
ones had. 
Q: On th eir hats? 
A: On their hats and on wherever the Œ 
Q: Oh. 
A: Œ had this, mo stly their hats. And Œ 

Q: And the communists had a different symbol? 

A: They had their Œ they ha
d the eagle without a crown. 
Q: Oh. Tell me a little b
it about the fa Œ okay, now we™re back into
 Wellesley. 
Tell 
me a little bit about the fa
mily that you stayed with. 
A: Well, the family owned a department sto re in 
Waltham
, it was one of those 
department stores and there was this inva
lid father, the mothe
r, and that was all. 
They  had two sons and they had a daughter, they lived  in 
Rhode Island
 or 
someplace like that, but they al
ways Œ they would come home to visit the fath er. One 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure  
February 2, 2001 

 

 
 
121
was a navy man and one was still in college
. And the daughter was already married 
in Œ I think she was in 
Rhode Island
. 
Q: And this was a Catholic family ? 
A: Was a very Catholic fami
ly, yeah, they went to ch
urch every blessed satur Œ 
Sunday. I™m still Saturday 
[indecipherable]
 Sabbath. And it™s funny, tha Œ an d 
that™s where lots of people think I™m Jewish
 because when I talk, not only do I move 
my  hands, and I say oh. I never said 
oy vey
, or 
[indecipherable]
 but anyhow Œ so, 
going back to the family, and they
 said to begin with that if 
Œ that if I ever wanted to 
leave to go to school that I can do it. And 
of course later on I had the letter from her 
that I s-s Œ they wished I w
ould have stayed until the fath
er died, because he really 
missed me. But I got the letter fro m this fri
end of mine, and she says, well, come and 
you stay with us and I™m already going to
 school and I™m working and all this, in 
Saint Louis. 
And so I can get you a job in our firm. 
Q: So how long were you in  
Massachusetts? 
A: Were in
 Massachusetts? 
Not very long. Must have be
en May Œ I think about six 
months, that was about all.  

Q: When you first came here, did you feel 
very much like a foreigner, did you feel 
the people looked  at you differen
tly in those first six months?  
A: No, because maybe they did look at me di
fferently, but I have this facility to get 
adjusted to any countr
y I™m in. My father always says, 
you have this talents to adapt, 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure  
February 2, 2001 

 

 
 
122
or to wh atever Œ to Œ to find a replace Œ 
to me, really ever Œ wherever there were 
people and good people, that was the worl
d to me, I never felt Œ course, my  English 
was horrible to begin with, but Œ but if I did Œ 
Q: But you fe Œ you felt respected? 
A: Y-Yeah. I mean, if I didn™t open my 
mouth, nobody knew I was a foreigner, was 
a well-dressed, and the lady always send me to
 a hairdresser in her department store. 

Q: Did you feel safe here? 
A: Yeah, fairly safe. I k
now nobody™s gonna touch me 
or anything like that. The 
only unsafe thing was going to  the street wi
th all those cars. But otherwise I Œ but I 
wanted to  go to school, that was my aim, and it was no Œ 
Wellesley 
College was so 
expensive and I, with  my  house-help salary
, there was absolutely
 no way I could, 
and no time to go to  school. Had no
 idea how important Œ how great 
Wellesley 
hills 
was, everybody was talking about 
Wellesley
 College, and I 
[indecipherable] 
college. I was very well prepared because Eu
ropean  schools, hi-h igh schools really, 
you like in a junior hi Œ like a junior colle
ge. I mean, I k n ew more than did junior 
college kids, because they have better school
s, ca Œ for the simple reason that they 
don™t take anybody, they  Œ you have to pass 
tests to be accepted, 
to show that you™re 
capable of Œ of wo rk ing the material. So
 Œ but I never felt strange. I maybe looked 

strange to them, but Œ 

Q: Now, you™re 26 years old now. 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure  
February 2, 2001 

 

 
 
123
A: Yeah. And I go to  
Sa int Lo uis
 and go to  school there, and I Œ 
Q: And where did you live? With a family? 
A: I lived with this family
 in this Œ sleeping on a cot 
and all that. And Œ but the 
school was way Œ I don™t know how Œ oh yes,
 and the girls said, you know, they said 

there™s a Polish invasion in the Œ i-in 
this match Œ Universal Match Company. A 
bunch of foreigners getting wo rk  and all 
that. And you know, it™d be better if you 
didn™t work here, because it™s gonna be bad 
for me, too. So there I was, and that was 
at noon an d we always went to the 
YMCA
 to eat. And I was cr
ying all the way and 
there was a blonde woman sitting there and sh
e says, what is she crying about? And 
she knew this girl. And she says, ah, becaus
e she just lost her 
work . And she Œ th is 
woman says something Œ somehow it ca Œ wa
 Œ came to  tell me, sh e says oh, she can 
come and stay with us, and we™re gonna lo
ok for a job for her. Because the office Œ 
not the office, but the universal Œ the offi
ce of the Universal 
Match Comp any, th e 
headquarters is really n-near where we live.
 And so I went to live with them, was the 
family of a mother and three sist
ers. One sister, the one that Œ 
Blondie, 
or
 Bonnie,
 
who took me in, and two sisters from the 
other father. And it turned out Œ sh e later 
told me that she only Œ oh 
yeah, the sist er said , oh sh
e only took her in so there 
would be two ag ainst two, because they we
re always quarreling about who is a better 
person in this family. Bu
t anyhow, they took me
 to this office in 
Ferguson
 and th e Œ 
to this Universal Match  Comp
any and the director of wh
oever the personnel office

is. Oh sorry, but we don™t have any wo rk
 fo r her. And I started crying and I said, 
gosh, after all this. I d on™
t know, somehow I mentioned 
the word camps. The minute 
I said the word camps, the guy woke up and he says, what camp s? And of course the 
directors were all Jewish, to say the tra Œ 
to say the least. And he says, what camp ? 
And I says, through the tears and I said, well 
this and that and all that. And he tooks 
Œ picks up th e telephone and he calls up th
e office of the Universal Match Company 
in 
Sain t Louis
 and he says, I need that work for a person that you just let go. She™s a 
typist. And, do you take
 shorthand? And I say yeah, a littl
e bit, but not very Œ yeah, I 
knew Po lish and German shorth and, so I al
ways took notes in German shorth and, 
but Œ anyhow, so Œ and I was so lucky that 
next to Œ across the street from the girls 
where I lived, lived one of the personnel Œ 
one of Œ somebody there lived who also 
work ed in  Univ ersal Match Comp any, so
 he would take me home and brin g me 
back. You have to get up five o™clock becau
se it was far away fro
m this Œ yeah, ferg 
Œ was called 
Ferg uson
, I think. And so, I started work ing and I start first time  on an  
electric typewriter. And I was used to this regular typewriter. So I Œ I hit this type Œ I 
mean, you know, I hit this thing and so mebody 
says, thanks God this Œ it™s look as if 
this typewriter was gonna float Œ fly out 
through the window. 
Bu t somebody says 
thanks God sh Œ she Œ the windows were
 closed because otherwise I don™t know 
what would happen. You know, I was at se
venth or eighth floor, or tenth, I don™t 
know. But anyhow, ni Œ 
so I worked there, and I stayed
 with the girls, but since I 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure  
February 2, 2001 

 

 
 
125
was startin g going to school, it was so diffi
cult for me because I had after cl Œ after 
work  I went to school, to night school at 
Wash ington U. 
And I™m just coming home, 
I was asleep and I was holding onto this st
rap in a bus and the 
ba Œ guy would say, 
sleeping beauty, time to get up, you arrived. 
And so I said I got to look for another 
place to live. So I was lookin
g and I was going through this 
Washington
 Street, I 
think, and every place it says for rent, for re
nt, and it Œ then I see this one it says for 
rent, for rent, and it was just cl Œ you know
, in the middle between work  and school. 
But it says, no women wanted or someth
i Œ only from Œ only for men. I don™t 
reme mb er the wo rdin g on this thing. And so
, as I pass by, the two old ladies were 
sitting on a porch and I look at the sign an
d I pass by. And one of them gets up and 
she says, aren™t you gonna co me in? And I 
say, why I™m a woman, I can™t come in. 
And I was dressed up, you know, to kill. 
And so what are you looking for? And I 
say, well, I™m looking fo r a place, because I live in 
Ferguson
, it™s too far for me to 
school, between wo rk and school. She says
, well, why don™t you look at the room? 
So, take me up. Sh e took me upstairs and I 
went upstairs and this and that and I said, 
well how about cooking facilities? And she 
says, well, we don™t let anybody cook, 
but if you promise that you 
never leave any dirty dishes 
and th at you Œ and we give 
you a little place. She evidently 
liked me, okay? And so I st
ayed with them. I stayed 
with them until I got married. 

Q: Now, did you have any co rrespon
dence with your family back in 
Pola nd ? 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure  
February 2, 2001 

 

 
 
126
A: Oh yeah, oh yes, yes, we 
corresponded all the time. My 
father said, as a matter of 
fact, don™t come to 
Poland
, there™s no future for you there. 
Q: So they were happ
y that you were in Œ 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Œ in the 
United States? 
A: Especially since I qu-quit the Œ since I 
quit this Polish consul
ate, you know, cause 
this was just too much Soviet 
[indecipherable]
 and all that kind of stuff. Our consul 
got arrested. 
[indecipherable] 
his wife got arre Œ he Œ 
how was it? He had to  send 
his own wife back to
 Warsaw
 because before she was married to this consul, 
Za m b r i t s k i
(ph) I think was his name, she w as 
married to another guy and th e guy 
was in the Polish underground army . And so
 he said Œ has to send her back. And 

everybody was saying how coul
d you Œ could he do that? 
And I say, well he did, 
cause otherw ise he would ha
ve to go too. Bu t anyhow, 
everybody was afraid. And 
there is this Œ my stepfather  needed  a new radio, he sa
ys oh, my  old radio doesn™t 
work . I say oh, I have a beautiful radio, I give you one, so on. And th ere was a 

cashier from the consulate that was going to 
Poland
 and he says, oh, I can take the 
radio and deliver. Oh here, take the 
radio. And then I hear from my boss 
[indecipherable]
 she said, you know wh at happen 
at the frontier? On the border, 
Polish Czech border or something, the guy 
was stopped, his ra Œ his car was check, 
the radio was taken apart and there he wa
s let go. Then  he comes and visits my  

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure

127
mother and stepfather and he 
brings this radio and he says
 he™s got to go someplace. 
And so my  stepfather says oh, I™ll take yo
u there, I know where it is, you don™t have 
to Œ was in the evenin
g, so you don™t have
 to wander through 
Kraków
. The minute 
they stepped out of the house they were 
arrested. And Œ yeah, and then every Œ it 
turn out that every place that this guy went
, people were arrested because they were 
saying th at a con Œ Polish consulate in 
Frankfurt
 was an American spy 
headquarters. See, everybody th at had anythi
ng to do with that, 
I don™t know if we 
could have been a spy there, except maybe 
for me, I mean I Œ wh
ich I wasn't even a 
spy, you know. All I did was Œ most of my  
work there for them 
was to Œ to go with 
them and trans Œ translate things for th
em, you know. But anyhow, so he and my  
mo ther never forgotten Œ has 
forgiven me for Œ because wh
en  he came back he had 
emphysema. They say Œ I™m not 
even sure now, but it says
 
he was put in a Œ that™s 
how they  would get the truth out of you, th
ey would put you in 
water and they  would 
freeze it and they let you out and all that. 
Anyhow that™s what he was telling, and 
that™s probably a true 
[indecipherable]
. And Œ 
Q: So they ar Œ they arrest
ed him and put 
him in prison? 
A: Yeah. 
Q: For how long? 
A: I don™t remember for how long, but bo
th Œ he was freed 
every Œ cause they 
couldn™t Œ after Œ but when  he
 got out he was just not a 
man any mo re, he was just a

128
piece of 
[indecipherable]
 that was old and in Œ so and he died from this 
emphysema. And of course if it hadn™t been
 for my  radio, he would never been 
where he was. And so Œ so then  Œ 
Q: So then we™re Œ 
A: Oh yeah, so I was told 
Œ somebody says to me, I don™t know how it was said, but 
I really Œ I really stopped Œ stopped wo rki
ng th ere for Œ fo r this consulate and I went 
back to school and then  the papers come a
nd then the guy says, you™re all clear to go 
to the 
United States
 and I went to 
Bremen  
and Œ and 
Bremenhaven
(ph) and on 
Blatchford
 and back, I mean in Œ to 
America
. On the 
borg
 Œ on th e ship that Œ that 
the marines Œ course it™s really, th e ship
 was run by th e navy, but it was worked  by 
the people, and that™s how I met my husba
nd th ere. But an yhow th ey were saying, oh 
there comes this bunch of foreig ners who ar
e gonna take our jobs. So  it wasn™t very 

Œ so, I got the bad preparati
on, I expected worse things 
America
 and I didn™t see any 
bad things, so Œ 
Q: So you kept up a co rresp
ondence with your 
future husband after you got off the 
boat? Cause you said you™re now in
 Sain t Louis
, and Œ 
A: Yeah, and I had this other friend with
 whom I Œ whom I known because of my  
work  and Œ and we always Œ 
but this Œ this navy Œ the Œ 
the sailor kept wri-writing to 
me. An d  comes Ch rist mas t ime a n d  I say  
to one of the girl
s, how do you say a 
Christmas card, and wh at do 
you say on a Christmas card? And th ey all say, dear
 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure  
February 2, 2001 

 

 
 
129
Charles
, and so  I wrote dear 
Charles
, but by mistake I have sent this letter to the 
fellow in 
Chica go
. He comes in, you know, wh at 
is this? What™s this with
 Cha rles
? 
And I say well Œ wh at™s her name  
[indecipherable] 
or something says, well that™s 
how you write to people, but 
wh at do you have to do with
 him? And I said, the guy 
was nice, he saved me from be
ing seasick and I work in  hi
s cabin, and Œ what cabin? 
And I said, well, there are 260 people and a
ll that. But anyhow, all he Œ and so  we 
broke off. And I send this card to 
Charles Belfoure
 and I said, this card cost me my 
boyfriend. And 
Cha r les
 says, that™s good, because th
en I can be your boyfriend. 
This is how we got together. And that was 
a big mis Œ bad mistake too, but you make 
mistakes w ithout knowing, 
you marry somebody without
 knowing his back ground, 
anything like that, I mean the Œ I 
don™t know, but he was charming. 
Q: What Œ what Œ when  did you get married? 
A: When? ™53 or something like that.  

Q: And the Œ so you stayed in 
Sain t Louis
 for three years? 
A: I stayed, yeah, and then we Œ a
nd when we got married we went to 
Milwaukee
, 
the Great Lakes where the navy station was. 

Q: Wa-Was he in 
Sain t Louis 
doing Œ during th at time? 
A: No, no, no, no, he was in
 Œ he was in Great Lakes in the navy, he was just 
coming, yeah. And he was a good mathem
atician really, because the vise Œ we 
would meet in 
New York
, and Œ because he was coming from the ship. And I said I 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure  
February 2, 2001 

 

 
 
130
can™t come because I have a 
math exam. He says, oh I can 
help you and all that. So I 
thought he was a reall y  univ
ersity person, wh ich he was not. And to me, educated 
person was Œ I mean, I just Œ I know 
from experience from other people that 
mismatched educationally people never ge
t along. And so Œ well, I Œ I made a 
choice, and that™s it. 
Q: And so th en in Œ you got marri
ed in ™53 and where did you live? 
A: Then we went Œ th en he wanted  to Œ hi
s mother got sick and 
her Œ his mo ther live 
in 
Cumberland, Mary land,
 that™s where his family live. And so we moved to 
Cumberland, Maryland
 and he got to work for the 
navy Œ naval reserves office 
there. He was a petty officer, and Œ but he
 was always typing. And so  we wo rked  
there Œ I mean he worked ther
e and I lived there in a very small ap artment. A nd all I 
was dreaming ab out is going back
 to school. And next to 
Cumberland
 was 
Frostburg
, which is a uni Œ was a college town 
at that time. And I don™t know, I had 
some neighbors nex Œ next door, very we
althy people. And one time I got to know 
them and the man says, all dressed  up 
and no place to go. I 
was waiting for my 
husband to pick me up somepl
ace, and we started talking 
and then they invited me 
and my  husband, and he woul
d never come, because I said
, why don™t you want to 
come? And he said oh, because those are 
millionaires. And I said, millionaires are 
people too, big deal. But that™s where he 
wouldn™t go because they
 were not his Œ he 
Œ he has nothing to show up. And anyhow, 
so these people kept saying, why don™t 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure  
February 2, 2001 

 

 
 
131
you just go back to colleg
e? And so I went and I got accepted and I had some credits 
from 
Washington U
., except they were not all acc Œ accepted in 
Frostburg
 because 
they have their own standards and all that. 
And since I signed up that I will teach two 
years after graduation, I didn™t have to pay 
tuition, all I had to pay is like student™s 
dues and all that. And I think one of my 
brothers will alw ays give me Œ without 
name Œ naming he Œ without saying his name, 
he always give me like a gift for me 
for 45 dollars or something, so Œ sp ecia
lly since they saw me on the Dean™s list
 
and 
they were proud of me and all that. And 
my  husband hated it, but anyhow. And then 
Œ and then one day, the marr
iage ended and there was th
is little boy. And this little 
boy is now 46 years old and he is
 an architect, but he still is 
sore at me that he didn™t 
live with a father and mother
 and all that kind of stuff. I could Œ just couldn™t live 
with a man who made a kid with so mebody el
se, I just co uldn™t Œ couldn™t take it off, 
cause even if I was a real 
Christian I would have forgiv en him because I pray every 
day, I say forgive us our trespasses as we 
forgive those who trespass against us. But, 
I don™t know, it™s not an easy thing to do. An d I wanted to go to school, I knew that 
if I stayed with him, there was no way for 
me to finish school. And he also said to 
the chaplains 
[indecipherable]
 we were so happy, but Œ until she started wanting to 
go to school. So that™s it.  

Q: So th en Œ 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure  
February 2, 2001 

 

 
 
132
A: So th en after I graduated, and sin
ce I gradu Œ had some mo re credits or I 
graduated bef Œ oh yeah , before
 I even graduated I started 
going to graduate school 
in 
Middlebury, Vermont
. And my  son, I put my  son in a Catholic camp  in summer 
on th is, some kind of lakes in 
Lawrence,
 or something. And he
 went to camp  and I 
went to school. And so then wh en I was graduating from 
Frostburg 
State I already 
had credits Œ some credits from the graduate
 school. And then co
 Œ I continue and I 
got Œ oh yeah, before I even 
Œ before I even Œ I really ne
ver made an application fo r 
a job because one of my chemistry teachers
 Œ professor, one time I got a 65 and so I 
went to him and I said, how co me I only got
 65? He says, because you didn™t know 
anything. And he says to me Œ then he e
xplains to me how I should study chemistry 
and all this, says if it™s water 
[indecipherable]
 cascading water in the sea, you think 
about it what™s in it ch emicals and all that, 
what it can do, temp eratures. And he says 
to me, well, not everybody be
 Œ could be a genius or 
Copernicus
. And I said, do you 
know that 
Copernicus
 was Polish? He didn™t even know that 
Co pernicus
 was 
Polish. But anyhow, he sa
ys not everybody can be 
Copernicus.
 When I was 
studying German, I couldn™t Œ I was such 
Œ such a bad student, I couldn™t understand 

the difference when to say this and that. An
d I said, oh that™s very easy, I can explain 
it to you. If you™re going to it, it™s accusative 
[indecipherable]
 are in there, it™s a 
question of the in. And if you
™re there, then you use the 
[indeciphera ble]
. Well, that 
was my certificate for being a good teache
r. Because one time I was going through a

133
hall and his office was open and he had three 
men in it and he says, oh, there goes a

anybody. And those people were the 
Baltimore

at the time. 

A: The office and they Œ they said
, you have a Œ you have a job in 
Baltimore 
co un ty . 
Now it™s a question of what sc
hool. And I have Œ I have Œ 
Janet Levin
 was a very 
good friend. Her husband used to be a 
rabbi, but he stoppe
d being a rabbi and 
become a lawyer, and they moved to 
Baltimore.
 And th ey said, why don™t you come 
and si Œ you know, we™re such a good friends
, you know, that to stay, and we can be 
friends. 
[indecipherable]
 big friends but we can Œ you can be with  us and all that 

and your son can have a home 
like he used to have. Becaus
e they used to pick  us up 
on a Frid ay for Shabbas and I was a Œ a Sh
ab bas goy fo r them, and then they would 
take us back home on a Sunda
y. And he ha Œ and he had 
Œ they had little children, so 
he play with them, he was older than they  
were, but he was this big boss and all this. 
So he had like a family life. And Œ 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure  
February 2, 2001 

 

 
 
134
Q: How Œ how old was yo
ur son wh en you and you
r husband got divorced? 
A: We never Œ we have never been  divorced. 
Q: Oh, because you™re Catholic. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Yeah, yeah. 

A: And he didn™t want to be divorced beca
use so he wouldn™t have to marry all the 
women th at he seduced, or they seduced  him.
 But anyhow, so he Œ he was four years 
old, four years old. We just stayed togeth
er until his mother died
, because his mother 
Œ he didn't want to make 
his mo ther unhappy. And so 
Janet
 says, come to
 
Baltimore
, and I said, well I Œ so the question 
was, where Œ what high school to get 
in order to Œ since I didn™t drive 
a car I had to be close by. And so
 Janet
 was looking 
for a school Œ for a place to live, and th e 
secretary of the school Œ because I finally 
decided 
Wo od la wn
, but as Œ I couldn™t take it, be
cause they were Œ and somebody 
just Œ their teacher got married
 so in the middle of the 
year, in January they were 
without a teacher for four Œ French four and 
five. And so I said I will take the job, 
but I need a place to live close by so that 
I can walk to school. And so when they 
were asking in the Œ all those places that re
nted apartments, one of them says, oh, I™d 
Œ we just rented an apartment in 
Woodla wn, 
and she™s also a teach er. And the 
secretary says, her name wouldn™t be 
Belfoure
 would it? And she says yes, how did 
you know? And she says, oh 
[indecipherable]
 so she Œ the Œ the director later on 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure  
February 2, 2001 

 

 
 
135
said the principal 
[indecipherable]
 she came  running into  his office and he says, we 
have a teacher. And so that™s how I Œ exce
pt that it was winter and I was putting my 
trashcans out and my  son opened  the door an
d he says, do I look good in this type? 
Cause he was going for the first time to hi
s new school, so he wanted to look good. 
And I turned  around, but since I didn™t know
 th at Œ I didn™t know the Œ wh ere I was 
really standing and I fell down. Thanks God 
I had this Persian lamb  coat on me so I 
didn™t get all bruised, but my  knees were 
bruised and my  face and all that. So my  
first day to school I was wearing black gla 
Œ dark glasses and I look really Œ I can 
imagine, in winter, to wear dark glasses.
 But that™s how I started at the school. 

Q: And then how long did you remain a teac her? 
A: 25 years in the same school. So  Œ 
Q: Did you say Œ did you ge
t a graduate degree from 
Middlebury
? 
A: Yeah, mm-hm. 

Q: What Œ what did you get? 
A: French. 
Q: A Œ a master™s degree? 

A: Yeah, a master™s degree, yeah. 
Q: Yeah, uh-huh. 
A: And of course they sa
id you don™t really need to sp end money on German 
master™s, b ecause you know German better th
an the masters. But I Œ I-I si Œ I Œ I Œ 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure  
February 2, 2001 

 

 
 
136
too bad I didn™t, because I 
would have gotten mo re mone
y. Everybody was saying, 
why don™t you teach in college? And I said, 
because it™s Œ I™ve been to college, so I 
know how they teach. You can
not influence anybody, and if you teach younger kids 
in high school, you still Œ oh, you still can do
 something and help 
them or tell them Œ 
put them on a straight route, how important
 education is and all that. Once you™re in 
college they don™t care, all they do is liste
n to you Œ to your lecture and put down  
stuff and they repeat to you verb atim, so on.  
Q: So you felt very accepted. Did you 
feel very Polish then, or American? 
A: I think I feel very American. I Œ 
Q: Whe-Whe-When did you
 get your citizenship? 
A: When I was still married. 

Q: Uh-huh. What was that like for yo
u to become an 
American citizen? 
A: Well, in the first place, it were Œ in Œin  those days the first thing you did wh en 

you got off the boat, you went
 to the naturalization servi
ce to ask for citizenship Œ I 
mean, you have to request this thing. 
And then  because I 
was married to an 

American military, I didn't  have to wait se
ven years, but I thin
k I only had to wait 
five years or something like 
that. But then you had to pr
epare for all those exams and 
my  husband and his fishing friend would stay 
home and help me w
ith this thing. But 
one wa Œ my  husband was a republican an
d this other was a demo crat and they 
would quarrel all the time. And 
so when  I went to this, because you have to Œ they ca 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure

137
Œ asked you to Œ th e wa Œ this Œ the lawyer 
has to present you to 
the things at this Œ 
as a person who wants to take the examinati
on. All during the ex
amination they said 
to me, now what do you thin
k of the americ Œ  of the de
mocrats and the republicans? 
And I said, I still wonder how on earth this 
country  be run effectively with all these 
guys quarreling among themself. And th
e guy, the judge says, no that™s not 

quarreling, that™s disputing. 
[indecipherable]
 they disputing or not. And I got it, but 
my  husband never told his mo ther that I got 
that citizenship, she ha
d to read it in the 
newspaper. Cause they took the pi
cture with a Œ the senator from 
Maryland
 was 
Bell
, and there was some Italian lady to
o who Œ in a small town, you know, 
something like that, to be Œ to be a citizen
 is a big deal, you know, not Œ not as in 
other place where you have h
undred of them, you know. 
Q: What did it mean to you? 

A: Well, what shall I say? That I was rea
lly proud of the country and I can vote. I 
couldn™t da Œ I couldn™t wait til I could vote, I mean, 
that was my thing, cause you 
hear Œ that was 
Eisenhower
 at that time and they said, but you are a democrat, and I 

wasn™t a democrat, I w as really a repu
blican at that time. And of course 
Eisenhower
 
was my liberator, so I voted 
for him. But then Œ thenwhen I was in school in 
Frostburg, 
I had to make extra money after my  husband left, and I work  in a 
kitchen. And I lived in a house where th
ere was a restaurant dow-downstairs and 
then we live upstairs. And so it was the easie
st work for me because I didn't have to

get dressed or anything like that. And I coul
d leave the boy upstairs and th e people 
from the hotel were watching him. But I didn™t
 leave him upstairs, I Œ really he came 
with me and he was pain
ting and drawing and some
times he would fill the 
saltshakers and all that. And 
I only stopped wo rking in  this restaurant because they 
said, be very polite to the customers, but
 the customers always weren™t Œ he says, 

and don™t put the bill on the Œ 
on the table, give it to them Œ give it to his hand. Well, 
you give this to his hand and 
he holds your hand. He asks you for a date and all that 
kind of stuff. And I said, but you are marrie
d, cause you can see. And he says, well, 
that doesn™t matter. So that™s how I say, oh 
my gosh, I can™t work
 like that and then 
study and all this. So there was the Œ he says
, well the only other job he says, to wash 
dishes. And so I went to wash dishes, but
 my  son was always showing Œ there™s a 
peephole and he was showing people that 
his mo ther is working washing dishes. 
Well Œ and well, I wouldn™t have stopped th
is work  except that one day I put my 
chemistry notes al Œ on this washing m
achine, and wh en I open it, you know, the Œ 
the damp , or Œ 

Q: The steam? 

A: Huh? 
Q: The steam? 
A: The steam took the Œ took all my  notes and 
so  here I da Œ that was a lost day for 
me. So then I 
[indecipherable]
 these people would say, can™t you get Œ you can get

139
a job in college, can™t you? And so then I 
accepted a job in a college. First I worked 
some kind of thing, some paperwork fo r a 
psychology department. Then  I was teach 
Œ then I was Œ i-it was a blind girl who 
was taking Fren ch and I was helping her, 
taking notes and Œ an d Œ for her and all that
. And then  Œ then I no Œ by th at time I 
graduated, and I already had this
 job waiting for me, so anyways 
[indecipherable]
 
[tape break]
 Well, an yhow
, Janet Levin
 was Œ I met 
Janet Levin
 in
 Cumberland
 
and before I met 
Janet Levin
 I knew a Jewish family, a fu
rrier™s family that I went 
to visit and Œ and I saw the Hanukkah ca
ndle and so sh e says
, oh how do you Œ I 
said, when is Hanukkah? And she said, 
how do you know about
 Hanukah? And I 
said well, I come from a place 
that has every fra Œ fifth pe
rson is a Jew, so you have 
to know about Hanukkah
. 
But anyhow, one day this man says, I got bad news Œ bad 
news for you, I™m losing my
 sight. And I said, oh you 
[indecipherable]
 your 
Hebrew, I could read it to you. Cause I was a 
lady of leisure at that time. And so here 
comes, I don™t know, next month or something,
 he says hi, I™ve got the Œ I Œ I made a 
da Œ date with the rabbi and you can lear
n Hebrew because they giving Œ there™s a 
new rabbi in town and he™s 
giving cu Œ his wife is givi
ng classes for beginners. And 
so that™s how I met
 Janet
 because I was looking for a rabbi and this Œ you know, the 
Polish rabbi with the 
ha rva r tz
(ph) and all that kind of stuff and I didn™t see 
anything, I just saw young men at the door
 of the shul. And th is redhead comes to 
me and says, you waiting fo r somebody? And I sa
y yes, for the rabbi. Oh, th ere he is. 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure  
February 2, 2001 

 

 
 
140
And I said, where? And she says there, th
ere, the man at the door, shaking hands 
with the people. I said, that™s not a rabbi
. You sure he™s a rabbi? I ought to know, 
he™s my husband. That™s how I met 
Janet
 and we become very good friends. And it 
Œ the deal ended beca
use they left for
 Israel
, the whole family left fo r 
Israel
 and Œ 
and I got Œ I said goodbye at the 
Œ New York
, at the si Œ ship. But she gave me, as 
inheritance, to her friend
 Linda Ford
, who still lives in 
Baltimore
, and sh e says, 
now remember when there™s a
ny holid ays, make sure you 
invite her to your house 
for holidays. So ever sin
ce I™ve been going to this 
Linda Ford
. And before she was 
Linda Ford , 
she was 
Linda Polack
(ph).
 
And so that comes New Year™s, or Easter, I 
mean I Œ I™m always there, as an inherita
nce. So wh en  she introduces me to other 
people she says, that™s my  inhe
ritance. And so that™s how Œ 
Q: And then  Œ and th en you Œ you said you 
retired after 25 years. And when  was that 
approximately, in the late 80™s? 
A: It was either ™89, or se Œ 80 Œ I 
[indecipherable]
 ™88, but I heard on th e television 
that there Œ there™s a new office, Red Cro
ss office that l o oks for translators, ca use 
there™s a new office tracing Œ the Holocaust 
an Œ war victims tracin g  office of the 
Red Cross and is looking fo r a translato
r. And since I was al-always a champion for 
the Red Cross, I was even a president 
of th e Polish Red Cross, had a certain 
[indecipherable]
 junior Red Cross in my  school, so
 I always thought very highly of 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure  
February 2, 2001 

 

 
 
141
the Red Cross, so I jumped 
to the Red Cross, okay. And I went there and we got a 
little schooling what the Red Cross is a
ll about and all that and th en we Œ 
Q: This is the Red Cross office in 
Baltimore
? 
A: 
Baltimore
, yeah, that™s the central Œ this is 
really a central o
ffice for the tracing 
for Holo caust victims and Œ Ho locaust wa
r victims. The national searches for 
military and all this, but we do search fo
r Holocaust and war victims. And I started 
work ing, but then one day, 
on th e door of th e Red Cross, we see an announcement 
by th e Ho locaust Museum, that the Holocaust Museum is looking fo r translators. 
And so 
Morris Rosen
 and I jumped at it and Œ course
 we didn™t know how difficult 
it is to get to 
Wa sh ingto n
 from where I lived, and we st
arted work ing. The mu seum 
wasn™t open yet, so 
we worked, I think it™s 
Eighth  
Street, or 
E 
Street, who Œ 
Q: Tw Œ 20
th
 and 
L
. We™ll Œ we™ll get to that in a mi
nute. I wanted to talk a little bit 
more about your Red Cross work first. Wa 
Œ  just exactly what 
did you do at the Red 
Cross? 
A: Well, I do Œ in the very 
beginning we would get applic
ation that f Œ somebody is 
looking for mother, father, 
brother, whatever it is, so 
there are certain forms, 
specially the forms Œ the forms were different 
[indecipherable]
 in every year the 
forms got Œ were changed just to Œ to 
make it easier because the Œ you get an 
application from us, and we send this 
to the international tracing service in 
Arolsen.
 
And then  they look in th e papers and course
 they have all their 
lists, and if anybody 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure  
February 2, 2001 

 

 
 
142
can find anybody, it™s supposed  to be ther
e. Because there were Œ but however it™s 
difficult because before the Gestapo and the
 SS
 left, they burned
 most of their 
materials. S o  it™s very difficult to Œ to 
really find somebody. You can never find 
names, for example, of Œ right after the war, when 
Poland
 lost the war, all the 
Jewish synagogues were bur
ned, and po Œ Jewish popula
tion™s registers was kept by 
Œ by the synagogues, the birth and the ma
rriage records and all that. So once the 
synagogue was burned, that was it. And be
n Œ then besides, since the Jews never 
lived together with the Poles, or the ve
ry few Pole Œ Poles knew the Jews and the 
Jews knew the Poles. They 
only knew each other in comme
rcial situations, but not 
that I could go Œ some Œ somebody could sw
ear yeah, I know this Œ this Jew came 
from this and this place, or this. So we ca
n™t really find anybody like that. Besides, 
what they did sometimes, they
 got this whole Jewish population on th e side of some 
river or something and shot them, or what
ever it was. And in  the very beginning it 
was like that. And Œ course they  didn™t us
e them for work like they did later, they 
just got smarter 
[indecipherable]
 smart er in quotation marks. And so it™s Œ so we 
were looking for these people, but it™s very 
difficult to find it, especially women. But 

seems like men, who were then put to wo
rk, were easier to trace, whereas women 
and children were shot before they were ev
en  put to work or anything like th at, so Œ 
so what we did, we would just write out
 the names and professions and where they 
were born and all that, and 
you think possible that c
ould facilitate the finding. 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure  
February 2, 2001 

 

 
 
143
Q: So you Œ  
A: And this ki Œ since that was also Œ we
 had to write this in
 German because we 
didn™t want to Œ otherwise they 
would have to have somebody in 
Germany
 translate 
from Œ so Œ and then their 
Holocaust tracing went to 
Germ any
 and th ey kind of set 
up sp ecial forms so that they were easy to 
read and now th ey have databa Œ base, so 
it™s mu ch easier too, to find, but of course
 now it™s 50 years. But believe me on that, 
they still people who 60 or 50 years after, l
ook for their mother or
 father. I say they 
couldn™t have done that a 
little bit early? But maybe 
they thought they didn™t 
survive, so they had giving 
up. And now they find out th
at after so many years some 
cousin meets another cousin  and so Œ 
and it™s mo stly the grandchildren, or 
grandchildrens, who want to know where th
e fathers Œ grandfathe
rs or grandmother 
died, or where they come
 from an d all this, so Œ 
Q: These are Jewish and non-Jewish survivors? 

A: Yeah. Well now, there are no more non-
Jewish survivors, but Œ but the families 
of the Jewish survivors. 

Q: I Œ I meant for families 
of Jewish and non-Jewish. 
A: Yes. A-And then  Œ now it™s Œ since the Po
lish slave la borers came
 to this age that 
they need  some kind of documents that 
there was slave laborers, now we are looking 
for those, too. And Œ 

Q: So you are still work
ing for the Red Cross? 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure  
February 2, 2001 

 

 
 
144
A: Yeah. 
Q: And how mu ch time do you devote to it?  

A: Ah, th e Thursday  and so metime I™ll take
 home p-papers home if I don™t finish, 
but mo st likely I just 
w o rk  on  a T h u r sd ay . 
Q: So wa Œ do you Œ do y Œ 

A: What we™re doing right now is in orde
r to facilitate this with the Polish Red 
Cross, we develop forms that we translate th
e applications into Po
lish. So then that 
takes less time in 
Poland
, so that™s what I™m practica
lly doing. And once they  put in 
a base, or database, I translate it in  
Polish so th en they  can be sent to 
Poland
 and 
taken care of by the Po lish Red Cross without
 the people knowing English. So  th at™s 
my work there. 

Q: Mm-hm. Do you find 
that rewarding work? 
A: Oh yes, in the first place, here I doi
ng something, maybe yo
u bring some kind of 
closure or something, and besides, I like tr
anslating and I like Red Cross, so the all 
three things goes together.  

Q: At the end of the war, when you were still in
 Euro pe
 and word  came out of the ta 
Œ wh at truly happened to many of the victims, which I assume you didn™t know 
during th e war time, do you Œ can you descri
be wh at some of your thoughts were 
when you saw pictures from the camps, from 
Auschwitz
? 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure  
February 2, 2001 

 

 
 
145
A: You know, I cannot say it over and over 
again that I could not understand how a 
cultured nation could come so
 low to kill innocent people
. That Œ this was my Œ I 
don™t know, and then there was my 
own guilt that I didn™t do more. So Œ 
Q: What could you 
have done mo re? 
A: I don™t know, I had Œ I could have ma
ybe help hiding mo re
 people. Maybe Œ I 
don™t know, I just still feel that I h ave 
not done enough, and I could have done, 
because I had this Œ thi-this uncle who wa
s doing it and I could 
have maybe Œ maybe 
helped. I don™t know, but by th e time I got 
to all my friends Œ see, I was in a 
different part of time Œ town 
then. When I went to elemen
tary school I went with a 
bunch of Jewish girls and all that. But 
wh en  I moved aw ay, an
d then I came back, 
none of th em was left. So Œ but still I Œ I fe
el like I should have done more. It™s this 
guilt, plus this why am I here? Why they
 and not I, you know, this is Œ I think 
anyone who survive all this is asking himself 
that question. So there Œ here I am, for 
how many years, I don™t even
 remember how long. Anyhow 
[indecipherable]
 to 
remember, in the museum. 

Q: You had gone over to 
Euro pe
 a couple of years ago fo r the Red Cross, to a 
conference? 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Can you tell a little b
it about that trip?  

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure  
February 2, 2001 

 

 
 
146
A: Well, to tell you the truth I don™t rememb er very mu ch . I went to 
Arolsen
, and we 
went to 
[indecipherable]
 to 
Vola ry,
 because
 Morris Rosen
 wanted to see the 
graves of the Œ he was Œ he™s Œ hi
s sister bri Œ on th e death march to 
Vola ry
, or from 
Vola ry
 or from wherever it was, there were lo
ts of girls who were Œ who died , and 
some of them Œ of his sister™s frien ds were
 buried there and he wanted  to see if their 
graves are taken care of. So that™s when we went to 
Vo lary
 and then we went to 
Munich
 with the Americ Œ with the Germ
an Red Cross, and Œ and to the 
international tracing service and that™s wh
ere I found out that I don™t even exist, 
except after the war. And Œ well, because ev
idently the man that
 I worked for had 
my  file destroyed so he wouldn™t have to 
send me back to this
 camp. And so I don™t 
exist, so Œ but it 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: Do you know exist in
 the fil Œ in the files?
 Do you know exist? 
A: I still don™t exist during th
e war. And Œ so, but we saw 
Arolsen,
 how it is 
organized and all that, and Œ and I don™t 
think they Œ they 
have enough help. 
Q: This is the center? 
A: The center. The International Tracing Cent
er. They don™t have enough personnel, 
they don™t have enough tran
slators, they don™t have an
y volunteers like we have. I 
mean, we have paid personnel, but with
out volunteers, you couldn™t do anything, 
you know. And Œ but they do
n™t have that stuff. Somebo
dy who can help them with 
their knowledge for nothing, so to say. 
And so that they ov erworked, underpaid 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure  
February 2, 2001 

 

 
 
147
probably , but Œ and Œ so it™s very hard 
to Œ for them to Œ and people always 
complained and they call this
 Œ I don™t know, I Œ I think I™ve seen a Œ some kind of 
video about Œ they call it 
Biederman™s
 
Reich. 
And 
Biederman
 is the man who ta Œ 
who is in charge of the International Tracing Service in 
Arols-sen
 and now they 
don™t do the things that they
 supposed to do. If they cannot 
wri Œ read the letter, they 
just put it away and th-they can™t find it all. 
I don™t know if this is a lie. It™s very 
possible that somebody who work ed there 
and th ought he or she was mi s Œ I don™t 
know, put it abused in quotation marks, as
 taking revenge or wh at, I mean I don™t Œ 
all I know that from what I have seen there 
is they just understaffed a-and the halls 
are full of those documents and they just 
don™t have enough people to Œ to work 
there. So Œ 

Q: S-So you are Œ are gi-giving one day a week in 
Baltimore
 and Œ yeah. And then 
you said you saw the sign about the Holoca
ust Museum, so you began to do what? 
A: Well, so 
Morris
 and I said, let™s go. So  we came  here and we started translating. 
And he mostly translated from Yiddish  
and Hebrew, and I from Polish and German. 
And sometimes there were some
 French th ings too, to do
, but mostly Œ in the very 
beginning it was lots of those diaries, Jewish
 diaries. And I co Œ you read the Jewish 
diaries and m Œ I™m Œ was like he was occ
upied with the Gestapo files, and Œ but 

Morris
 was reading those diaries and he had 
to summarize them, 
an d then lots of 
time I did that for him too, so Œ and it™s 
Œ it was really heartb
reaking sometimes. The 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure  
February 2, 2001 

 

 
 
148
whole work here, really is heartbreaking. 
Or rather it was more heartbreaking when 
we read this, the diaries. Bu
t you get so that you Œ that
 th Œ oh yeah, and then  from 
the Red Cross, we work in 
Suitland
 at this archives. And in
 the archives we were 
looking in th e death books and we found ab
out 40,000 names for th e Red Cross, for 
the tracing service, and got th
e little certificate from Mrs. 
Dole
 for Œ for dedicated 
work and all this kind of stuff. And for ex
ample, and we looked
 through the State 
department files too, and one of the rarely
 flu Œ yeah, I failed with that one. When 
you were poor and yo
u didn™t have a sponsor here, you couldn™t get to the ameri Œ to 
the 
States
. And one lady says, are you my  son? 
You only take care of the rabbis, you 
don™t take care of the regular people. A
nd th at was really Œ you only save the 
yeshivas and that Œ no, I don™t Œ 
I don™t know if she said yeshivas 
[indecipherable]
 
anyhow she says rabbis or something like th
at. And th at was heartbreaking too, I 
mean just showing how Œ how 
unjust this whole world is 
arranged. And that™s Œ but 
the law has nothing to do w
ith justice anyhow, so Œ 
Q: Does working on records 
of Jews, is that any differe
nt for you than
 w o rk ing  on  
records of non-Jews? 
A: I never work  on any records fo r non-
Jews, so I don™t really know. Well, you 
know, I Œ when we work in 
Suitland
, it was always Jewish records they were after. 
We were after getting the numbers for the tr
acing service of the Red Cross, so most 
likely we were looking for Œ for Œ for Je
ws. And, you know, an
y person who suffers 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure  
February 2, 2001 

 

 
 
149
is, really to me, is a 
[in d ecipherable]
 except that there™s so 
much Œ if I was Œ if I 
were to be killed, I would be killed because
 I did something against the Nazis, not Œ 
cause it™s true, all the Polish 
intelligentsia went Œ was kill
ed too, but I mean, I would 
have to do something, whereas if I were
 Jewish, I was to be dead because I was 
Jewish, I didn™t have to do an
ything. And so in a way it is
 different. But Œ so  that™s 
why I never say I™m a 
survivor, because I™m Œ really 
don™t feel like one, because my  
s-suffering was not in the slave camps, was 
not like the suffering of the Polish Jews. 
So if somebody asked me why don™t you come
 to the meeting or something like that 
and I say well, because I really don™t belong there. 
Q: This is the meeting of survivors? 
A: Yeah. Yeah, but you surviv e and you su
ffer, and this is true, I su ffered and I 
survived, but Œ but it™s Œ my suffering wa
s not like that of Œ of the others. 
[indecipherable]
 all the same, w ell, in a way. 
Q: What Œ what else is Œ so, I say Œ you™v
e been doing the same  kind of wo rk  for the 
mu seum since you started the translating? 
A: Yeah, all the Œ except that sometimes is 
Œ the Gestapo file is so metimes is some Œ 
now right now w-we had this 
new Polish archivist, Mrs. 
Alexandra Boretska
(ph) 
and she works Œ I do a lot of stuff for her 
now, to help her. And right now I think I™m 
work ing on two things. One was a fini
shed thing about the Jews who got 
[indecipherable]
, where they are, as you know, lik
e where they were deported, and 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure  
February 2, 2001 

 

 
 
150
who kept the records from 
[indecipherable]
 and all that. And the other thing that I 
just finished now that I™m rea
lly working on the, which ghetto 
[indecipherable]
 and 
I was working on 
Ringleba um™s
(ph) archives too, there, 
onek
(ph) 
shabbad
(ph). 
And I stood in the back, so I 
have thing about the Gestapo 
[indecipherable]
 from 
Paris. 
Q: So when you say you™re work ing on some
thing, you mean tran
slating it from that 
language into English? 
A: Yeah 
[indeciphera ble] 
into English, looking at the 
microfiche or something and 
then translating it. It would be easier for me
 if I could have a t
ypewriter there, and I 
didn™t have to write by hand and someb
ody had to write it again on the typewriter, 
but unless there is a silent typewriter, I 
[indecipherable]
. But I like my work, and I 
Œ I 
[indecipherable] 
now that I got old and sick, if I go
 to work, like I have to go in 
this rainy and sn owy day, I really should be 
in bed, but when I come here I don™t feel 
sick at all, because ma Œ my mind is oc
cupied with what I™m 
doing and not with my 
sickness.

Beginn ing Tape Five, Side A 
Q: This is a continuation of the 
United Sta tes 
Holocaust Memorial Museum 
volunteer collection interview with 
Kristina Belfoure
. This is tape number five, side
 
A. 
And you were talking about 
your experiences at the th-the mu seum, and you said 
it stimulates your mind. Wh at about emotionally? Wh at does it me an to you wh en 
you walk into this building,
 in an emotional sense?  

A: Well, at the beginning it was very emotiona
l, but in the time, it™s Œ I forget about 
that, wh-what this place stands for. Cause ot
herwise I don™t think I could really work 

and Œ and be effective, if I was alw ays th
inking about the horro rs and the persecution 
and the su ffering and all that, I don™t think I 
could work. I Œ I think that if I just say 
this is just work, that it ma
kes it easier for me. But then
 if I see the people in the 
halls, when pick up those passports, it™s Œ 
in a way it™s very good that I go all the 
way up to  the fifth floor, that I don™t have
 to go th rough Œ I even stopped going for 
coffee down stairs so I don™t have to s
ee the people walk ing th rough, because it 
always Œ I Œ you be thinking ab out, I wonde
r for whom are they work Œ wal Œ whom 
do th ey want to find out about, and who 
did th ey Œ wh om did they lose? And so I 
just take up to the fifth floor, I don™t ha
ve to meet anybody, and I just can go open 

the door and go to work .  
Q: Is there any particular part of the exhibit that you relate to?

A: Well, of course, the first time I saw it,
 it w as on Œ I don™t know what floor it is, 
but 
[indecipherable]
 this will happen in from three 
Œ three down, but then the most 
Œ I don™t know, emotional is when you 
see this Germans ta
king down  the Po lish 
border, what is it, border flag, o-or Po lish bo
rder line that™s white and red, you know, 
I mean, to me that was the 
Œ because I know Œ I Œ I lived through it when  they  came 
in, so thi-this was the most
 emotional to me, and I really didn™t look through the 
other ones, because I just couldn™t. And th
en of course, I still 
never could understand 
why nobody wanted to help them, and us t
oo, to help th em. I mean, that was Œ you 
see the newspapers and all this kind of st
uff, and nobody really 
did anything. And of 
course, privately people did, probably, bu
t I just can™t imagine how all this could 
have happen ed, but of cour
se it happened befo re, it happened with  the Armenians, 

and it™s gonna happen probably  with other 
people, and we haven™t learned anything. 

And Œ but the people dying out, I don™t know,
 we just have to do something that 
people rememb er how cruel one 
man can be to ward s the other. 
Q: Have you been through the pe
rmanent exhibit 
more than once? 
A: Twice, because I wanted 
to Œ you know, but then I 
never was looking down, you 
know, to this Œ where you™re 
not su Œ when Œ this place 
that they really show the 
tortures and all that. But then I already saw 
Do ra
 and I know Œ I didn™t see the 
people suffering thereby, so all the places 
where they were suffering, so Œ and I saw 

the ra Œ right after liberations it was a Œ i-it w asn™t clean or anything like that. I

mean, it wasn™t like it is now 
that it™s a museum. It Œ it w a
s still the old place that Œ 
that you can Œ could see the bunker and the 
[indecipherable]
 and all these places 
where all horrible things happen. And the 
appelleplatz
, and Œ and Œ and you hear the 
people telling ab out it, and you see it, too. So
 I really, about that, I Œ I knew, but then 
in those books and here in the 
documents, I meet the people.  
Q: Wh-W hat is your relationship with the ot
her volunteers? Both Jewish volunteers, 
or non-Jewish volunteers? 
A: Well, I don™t know if there are any 
no Œ Jewish volun Œ non-Jewish, I am 
probably  the only non-Jewish, because ever
ybody thought that I 
was Jewish, a nd one 
woman lo st a bet with her husband, cause
 he work ed upstairs and he swore I was 
Jewish. And she tol Œ she says, I j u st wo
n a bet with my  husband, I told him you 
were not, and Œ and since I always go with  
Morris Rosen
, they all think either I™m 
his wife or his girlfriend or whoever it is. 
And they call us your 
mates, and they call 
us your partner in crime, and wh atever. 

Q: This is another volunteer. 
A: Volunteer, Mr. 
Rosen
, yeah. And he comes from 
Baltimore,
 so if we can we 
come together, cause it™s safer, you know. Neither 
Baltimore
 nor 
Washin gton
 are 
safe places to walk through
, and that™s why we neve
r come to any of those 
volunteers™ evenings, because in the first plac
e, cost us money. No t that we couldn™t 
afford this, but then, just to
 come here for dinner, it doe
sn™t pay, because we can™t

catch Œ th-the last train  goes away at 10:
30, and who is gonna 
be paying hotel for 
150 dollars just for Œ it™d be nice to meet 
all the volunteers too,
 you know, and be in 
Œ and listen to a concert or see a movie 
or so mething like that, but you know, I 
guess, close your eyes and yo
u s Œ re-remember what you 
read, you can see a movie. 
So Œ 
Q: Have you gotten any special insights 
because of your work here? Have you 

learned anything since the la
te 80™s, when you started? 
A: Well, what I learned is this, that 
every one of our religions teaches about 

brotherly love and love
 your neighbor as yourself and we still not doing it. That™s the 
insight that I got. And I don™t know on the other hand Œ no, that™s not maybe in the 
mu seum I didn't learn that, but I was as
king my self, how would Œ you know, when 
you hear all this at Œ anti-Polish expressi
ons, how we Œ how we have killed the Jews, 
and how we didn™t help an
d all that. Nobody ever Œ 
I don™t know somebody Œ I 
wrote to the paper and was published, too.
 Like, for example, the present te Œ two 
organizations that, where the Jewish moth
ers threw their children through the floor 
traps, some body would pick th em up, and I 
Œ I was servi ng on one of those Œ how is 
it, stations, so to say. If you saw a trai
n that was coming through an d has a certain 
markings, which meant there we
re children on it. Now, didn
™t say Jewish children or 
Polish children, but there were some marki
ngs on the trains that Œ that you knew 
there were children, and you had to tell so me body else t h at so and so train passed

through this station. And th ere were Œ th
en you knew that someplace between one 
place and the other, there could have been a child who was dropped through the 
floor. And th en the Œ somebody would see 
to it that the child 
was picked up. And 
this was all organized, and I think it was orga
nized by the present pope, I think, of Œ 
he wasn™t a pope then , of course. But it wa
s all organized this way to  pick up the 
children that were dropped, 
so Œ and it Œ nobody even  k
nows about it. And it™s true, 
there were 
[indecipherable]
 and were bad people, like 
in every nation you had bad 
people. But why should I be paying and be 
responsible for people who were bad? 
And yet, it™s just because I™m saying I™m 
Polish, the mother sa
ys, huh oh. I mean, it 
happens very often. I mean, 
in Red Cross there was this
 new wo rker there and she 
says to me, ah, the Poles were
 so horrible to the Jews, kill
ed them during Œ and she is 
not even  Jewish. And she says Œ and I said
, who told you stuff like that? Absolute 
there were people like that, but they 
weren™t any better than the J-Jewish 
O.D.
 I 
mean, you know wh at 
O.D.
 is? 
Ordnung sdienst
, so the Jewish police. I mean, it 
was just as cruel as the Polish police or
 anybody else. I mean, and you Œ nobody Œ 
they were more hated in the 
ghetto some Œ for example, 
than Œ than ev
en the Polish 
police, cause you can always bribe the Polis
h police. An d of course I understand the 
Œ the 
Ordnung sdienst
, or the yi Œ Jewish police, they  wanted to stay alive, so Œ I 
mean, this whole idea was that everybody w
ho was in this situa
tion had to Œ wanted 
to surviv e, and the will to 
surviv e makes you do th ings that Œ I don™t know what I

would do if it was I who had to decide, wh
o had to fight for my  life, and f Œ and 
make a Œ prolong it for one or two or thr
ee days. Of course, ther Œ you were always 
promised you™re gonna stay
 alive longer. And I mean, 
the insight probably that I 
gain is that you never know
 wh at you would do in a gi
ven situation, that no matter 
how mu ch I b Œ was taught about this forg
ive our trespasses, love your brother like 
your own, like yourself. I don™t know wh at 
I would do, if I were
 pushed toward the 
wall. If my back was toward the wall, 
what would I do? And for God to judge 
people. I don™t know if we have th e right to  do it. Like the Indians say, don™t judge a 
person until you walk in his mo
ccasins. And that™s the truest
 truth there is, really.  
Q: You™ve written three books? 
A: Yeah. 
Q: What prompted you 
to write these books? 

A: Well, the first one was written by my Œ was Œ the first one that I wrote in a 

German Œ in a little German 
town was because my father
 Œ well, when I came to 
Poland
, and you know, the Poles hated the Germ
ans because almost every one of us 
lost somebody from the family
. My uncle was killed because the Œ all the professors 
were killed in 
Lvov
 when the Nazis came. And ther
e were other memb ers of the 
family that were incarcerated
, and they say her, she™s craz
y, saying that there are 
good Germans. But I say, bu
t I™ve lived there and I know 
that there were good ones, 
cause if Œ without them we woul
d have never survived. And so Œ

157
Q: This is when
 you came back to
 Poland
 after the war? 
A: To
 Poland
 to v Œ after the war to visit. An
d wherever I went it was the same 
story, so finally my father says, why don
™t you just sit down  and write the book 
about, in quotation marks, the good Germ
ans. And I say I unde
rstand why you think 
there were no good, all you saw was the Nazis, the
 SS, 
the Gestapo and the 
Einsatztrup
(ph) and you didn™t ever see Œ I said
, the system was h o rrible, but there 
were still g o od Germans. Oh no, of course 
not. And so that™s why I sit down to write 
the book, but you know how 
Œ I was teaching and raising 
a son, I didn™t have that 
mu ch time to write a book. Bu t so he never re
ad it because he died in ™76, so Œ so he 
never read it. But then once I started it, so
me body says no, so wh at, don™t leave us 
like Œ don™t leave us Œ tell us what happen
ed . So I wrote about the displaced persons, 
how our life was in the camps. A nd then so
mebody says again well, what™s the end? 
What™s the ending, can Œ oh yeah, I rememb
er I gave it to some
 Jewi sh couple to 
read and they said, well, can™t you write 
about some happy times? And I say Œ ya Œ 
like in 
America
 and all that kind of stuff. So I sa
id okay. So the last one is called
 
ﬁAmerica: Dreams and Reality,ﬂ 
and tells Œ this is the 
longest book, because of 
course it describes from what, ™51 to ™9
0 or 200. No , it wa
s published in 200 
[indecipherable]
 in ™89. And th e first one didn™t sell well at Œ at all in 
Poland. 
And 
as a matter of fact, the 
[indecipherable]
 went bankrupt. But I don™t think it was 
bankrupt on account of my book, praising 
Œ talking about good Germans, but it was 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure

158
because the guy didn™t know ho
w to Œ that was this time wh
en all this new capitalists 
wanted to  grab money and he just probab
ly  didn™t have any id ea how to sell books. 
Q: This is the book, ﬁ
In the Shadow
 
of Do ra
,ﬂ that you™re talking about? 
A: Yes, ﬁ
In the Shadow of Dora
,ﬂ I cou Œ I Œ  
Q: Now that Œ that™s here in the Œ in the 
United Sta tes 
Holocaust Memorial Museum 
library. 
A: Yes 
[indecipherable]
 
Q: Are the other two books here?  

A: I Œ nobody could find. I gave them Œ I gave it to the Œ I give this in the dep Œ from 

[indecipherable]
 lan Œ land of slavery, I gave it he
re and it™s not here, I can™t find it. 
I don™t know if I™ve given 
America
 to the Œ no, I don™t think yet, because I only had 
one co py, so I don™t think Œ and I don™t th
ink that would intere
st anybody, because Œ 
that might interest the displaced persons, b
ecause they went thro
ugh the same st ages 
of being Œ getting he
re and getting acquainted and all that.  
Q: Now, ba Œ these books have been in bo
th languages, in Po lish and in English? 
A: No, they all are in Polish except th
e one in the little Germ
an town that was 
published in  
Germany
, because the Germans got hold
 of it and translated it an d 
published without sending me 
the copy of the translatio ns
. So th ey are Œ and I was 
an idiot enough, I have Œ I have no contract
 or anything like w
ith Œ with them. So 
finally the guy said, if they sell 1,000 and 
the editor, I mean the 
publisher says 1,000 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure

159
copies, then I get some Œ and th e Œ his fina
ncial assistant said 1,500. And so I™m not 
gonna wait for that, okay? The 
fact is that I p u t down so
mething so that those who 
come after us knows what this generati
on of us went through and yet somehow 
survived . And I think th at the reason why we 
really survive is the 20 years of po Œ 
Polish independence, cause then we were 
Œ after the 123 years 
of being taken by 
Russians, Prussians and Au
strians, in this free
 Poland
, the
 Pilsudski™s
 free 
Poland, 
we Œ it was imbued in this crowd of the old 
Poland
, and I always was in this camp 
of this nation of a ma Œ kingdom or repu
blic of free nations, you know how that if 
you le Œ stick togeth er instead of qua
rrel, you can be somebody. And I always 
wanted 
Poland
 to be multi-culture and multi-relig
ious. And I had this teacher who 
always Œ in elementary school, who al
ways comp lain how dumb  the Polish 

government is and those national demo crats 
and all and this Œ a
nd so  finally Œ and 
we finally said well, can you tell us when 
Poland 
was really big? And Œ and she 
says, I™ll tell you. And she said, when th
e Russian Greek Œ no, wh en the Ukrain ian 
Greek Orthodox pre Œ prince said 
to his son, whom he sent to 
Italy
 to study, 
remember son, you are a Po
le. He says, that™s where 
Poland
 could be proud of 
herself. And that stuck with me so that Œ of 
course that™s impossible in this situation, 
when all those new ethnical quarrels and 
all this. I mean, people somehow didn™t 
know that you can live in peace, speaking 
a different language, pursuing a different 
religion, and Œ and I mean, and live in pe
ace in one country. Somehow people just

don™t see it, you can see it now, 
Africa
 or 
Yugoslavia
, wh erever we are, you see the 
same old stuff, this hatred. And Œ but then 
everybody says that I am is Œ all cynical 
and only see the bad side of the Œ of the 
history and I have a 
friend who says, now 
my  gosh, she finally said something good. 
And sh e sa Œ no, because I always see the 
down side of life. And I said, when you l
ook around, there is 
no up side. There are 
the rich and there are the p
oor. There are the educated 
and uneducated. And I know 
it™s the fault of an uneducated who drop from
 school and all that. And I see it™s the Œ 
every religious Œ wh ether it be 
a rabbi or a priest or whoever the others ones, they all 
preach their own catechism and Œ but I said
, but now, since we Œ since I see the 
Catholic church said we Œ not every Œ 
I have to Œ have to
 tell this to Mr.
 Rosen
, but 
this Œ this writing in the bulletin and says something about 
[indecipherable]
 yeah, 
something about the desert th
rough which our ancestors fr Œ no, it™s talking aya Œ in 
the life, working through life as in a Œ like ou
r spiritual forefather or faithful father Œ 
yeah, I got my faithfu
l fathers walked through the de
sert, as they coming back, th-
this Judeo-Christian idea. And 
Œ but to see that written in 
a bulletin, that™s kind of Œ I 
mean, that™s a totally different aspect as youhave seen, let™s say, even 20 years ago, 
before this pope. And I Œ I think that Œ 
but then you own the other Œ the Christian 
and the Jews can get together now, but 
how about the Arabs and the Jews? I mean, 
this idea of killing Œ going to 
heaven when you kill an en
emy? I mean it™s just so 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure

161
inhuman, the whole thought is inhuman. Bu
t maybe if we keep working at it we™re 
gonna get better, who knows? 
Q: Have you been  back  to
 Poland
 many times? 
A: Yes, I have been back to
 Poland
 and Œ but I never got a reception in 
Poland 
like 
Œ except for my  parents and families a
nd all that, like I got in Œ in  Œ in 
Tel Aviv
, 
cause my  Œ when  I went to the wedding, to  
Janet™s
 daughter, she already told 
everybody that her friend is 
coming and that she is from 
Poland
. And I went from 
one store to another, on one person to anot
her, cause they said, oh we would like to 
meet you cause my  mother™s from 
Poland
, my  grandmother was from 
Poland
, and 
she would so  want to hear. So I just we
nt from one place to another, you know? It 
was Œ you know, nobody was talking about an
ti-Semitism, or anti Œ because all these 
people, you know, left before the war. So 
their life was cultural, organized, and Œ a-
and you know, usually people
 that are smart remember 
g o od things. They don™t go 
back to th e horrible things
, cause that just sours up your life. And it wa Œ it was 
really great, and wh en we started talking 
and we one time all thought about th e same 
thing. Here the matzos are so small, 
you know, and back  home the matzos were 
huge, you know, like for a whole family 
nah
. And we talking about the 
kudskis
(ph), 
you know, that you make for 
Œ what™s that holiday that
 you build a shelter on the 
outside? 

Q: A Œ a sukkah? 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure  
February 2, 2001 

 

 
 
162
A: Sukkahs,
 
yeah. And Œ we call this 
kudski
(ph), I think. But an
yhow, so we talked 
about all these things and it was fun, 
it was really, really fun, those happy 
remembrances.  
Q: Uh-huh. What Œ what else
 were your feelings in 
Israel
 when  you got there? 
A: Oh, in the first place, wh
en I got there this guy Œ I was proud, you know, finally 
they have their own land, you know. I don
™t know whether I said Œ although I 
showed this guy my  passport and he said
 oh Œ no, the American™s passport don™t 
mention religion, do they? 
Q: Place of birth, but not religion. 

A: Yeah, and anyhow, I ca Œ he just keeps 
looking at it and now there™s flags, y ou 
know. And I don™t know, maybe I was Œ ah, no. I was supposed to  be picked up by 

Janet
, but 
Janet
 messed up the arrival time. An
d so here I am waiting and waiting 
and nothing happens. And then  maybe I ha
d tears in my eyes, but anyhow, I was 
looking at these flags and y
ou know that not to think a
bout, cause I™m always this 
person who thinks something wo rse Œ someth
ing bad happened  to 
you if you didn™t 
show up. And th e guy says to me, why you Œ 
he says, I exchange your dollars for the 
shekel 
and I put you in a taxi and you can 
Œ and you can go wher
e you™re going. 
And I kind of keep on looking and I say Œ 
I don™t know how, but anyhow he said Œ I 
was about to cry, I think, or something 
like Œ and I said, well I™m not crying fo r not 
meeting my friend, I™m crying cause I™m so 
happy seeing all this Œ these flags and all 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure

163
that, that you finally have your own land 
and you don™t have to
 wander through. And 
Œ and that was really Œ that was really gr
eat, when you think a
bout it. And then, all 
these Jews from
 Poland
 brought their Polish individu
ality and you have two Œ and 
you have 10 political partie
s like it used to be in 
P o la nd. 
They have all this idea, I™m 
the king and I know wh at™s right and you 
don™t. And I™m not lis
tening to wh at you 
are saying 
[indeciphera ble]
 still think about, and that didn™t fall from the sky, that™s 
the Polish experience, where ev
erybody could be a king. Even  had the saying that no 
women on his estate and his esta
te wasn™t bigger this Œ this
 room, is equal to the big 
governor, I mean that kind of
 stuff. And you see that in
 Israel
 when they start having 
all those political parties and all these diffe
rent words. It™s nothing but that they 
heard it. That they 
brought with them. 
Q: Did Œ do you think because of your ba
ckground you™re Œ th
-the way you raised 
your son was affected? I mean, obviously  it 
was because of the conditions that you 
were in, a single mo ther and having to  wo rk
 and go to  school. Bu
t because of your 
European background and the diffi
culties that you went through. 
A: I wou Œ 

Q: Did th at affect how you brought him up? 
A: Well, I was trying to just make sure th
at he gets good education. That was my  
main thing, my Œ however, since Œ I™m sorrythat I didn™t teach him Polish, when he 
was little h e knew it, but then my husband 
says, I don™t unders
tand anything he™s 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure  
February 2, 2001 

 

 
 
164
saying. And then I went to sc
hool and I didn™t have time, and I™m very sorry for that. 
And I didn™t imbue him with this proud Po
lishness that I have. An d he says, well you 
never say Œ you always praise 
Poland
. And I said, but I never said anything bad 
[indecipherable]
 
America
, but I™m Œ I™m proud of bein
g Po lish, I have a thousand 
year history behind me. And Œ of course 
he would have rather
 been born to some 
F r en ch  woman  Œ  I me an  Fren ch  immig r an t 
or English immigrant. He Œ for some 
reason he, no matter how I brou ght him up he still Œ he Œ he doesn™t have the same 
nature I have. He always complains that a
ll I do is always take care of other people 
instead of myself. And I say, because in real
 life, I mean at the end of your life, it™s 
not what you did for yourself, it™s what you
 did for other people. And wh at got to 
him, that™s so alien. Absolu
tely alien, and yet, since 
he was brought up with, in a 
Jewish home, so to say, he married a Jewish girl. 
Q: Wh-Why do you say he was 
brought up in a Jewish home? 
A: Well, 
[indeciphera ble]
 Shabbas we went to a Jewish home, I mean Œ 
Q: Oh, okay, that™s your friends, yeah. 

A: Œ yeah , with my  friends. And I mean, he Œ he thought that all Jewish people are 

the same like 
Janet
 and 
Stanley Levin
, fo r education and not 
for money and all this 
kind of stuff. And th en he marries this gi
rl. I don™t know what he expected. And he 
says, you know, there™s ka Œ all ki Œ they™re
 so cluster, they™re so
 exclusive, they™re 
so Œ see with 
Janet 
and Œ and 
Stanley 
he was used to, you know, being included, 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure  
February 2, 2001 

 

 
 
165
and he thought that every Jewish family is 
like that, that they 
would Œ that if they 
like somebody they  would sort of, yeah, gree
t him as their own. And he says, they™re 
not like that at all, they™re very exclusive.
 They don™t consider 
you one of their own. 
And I-I Œ I don™t know how Œ anyhow, the ma
rriage failed because of the money, I 
think, she wanted to stay in
 a little town, and he Œ and I said, well, I have those two 
Judo-Christian grandchildren. 
Q: Have you Œ di-did 
you become mo re religious because
 of your experience during 
the war? 

A: No, becau Œ 

Q: Or less religious? Did it affect
 you in any way, religiously ? 
A: On the contrary, I didn™t. I had less relig
ious for a simple reason that when I saw 
the suffering of the Jews, or I heard about it,
 and later I saw it Œ here is a nation that 
prays, keeps all these hundreds of commandmen
ts, prays to this God, and he lets his 
chosen people be chosen to the ovens. I r
eally stopped being religious. I go to church 
by tradition and I know there isn™t Œ there™s 
got to be somebody, cause even there 
wasn™t, we have to in vent him to make sens
e in life. What for how, why, but when Œ 

I mean, and I™m not the only one, there are lo
ts of Jewish people who lost their faith 
because of that. I mean
, when you really think what is
 Œ all this Œ so many people Œ I 
remember this one fellow wh
o Œ who got a chicken and he
 says Œ and his mo ther 
wouldn™t eat it, she™d rather
 be hungry  and skinny because it was not kosher chicken.

I mean, here the guy goes through all this 
tro uble to buy this ch
icken and his mo ther 
refuses to eat because it™s not kosher. I 
mean, it™s Œ I understand, walking through 
the desert you had to  keep 
your hygiene so that you st
ay alive, cause the Œ not 
enough water and Œ and p-plag
ues and bad food c
ould just kill a whole family, whole 
tribe. But I mean, in modern  times? But that Œ that was 
wh at mak es me Œ  wh at mad e 
me really not believe. I just know that ther
e™s all this preachers and rabbis, they tell 
their own story now beca
use they want to stay in cler
ical garbs. But I-I Œ I really Œ 
and I go to church  and I look at it and 
I say my  pray ers and th en I say, wh at a 
hypocrite you are. An d then Œ but when  I™m in
 that church, I pray, and I say this Our 
Father and all this. And of course Œ an-and
 the reason why I really don™t see any af Œ 
saw any anti-Semitism is because
 you always read this firs
t old Bible, you know the 
Œ you know the Œ they is Œ and th en be
 Œ the Bible, the story from the Bible Œ 
Q: You mean Œ you mean the he 
Œ the Hebrew Bible, you mean? 
A: Hebrew Bible and then you read the 
evangel
 and the new things, you know, so 
there is always this connection an d they
 always say the ceremony about this Old 
Testament and Œ yeah, that™s what they
 call it, Old Testament and this New 
Testament. And so I always saw this connec
tion, but the Œ in practical Œ in practice, 
this thing didn™t wo rk out. It™s only now co mi
ng back that they st
ress all this Judeo-
Christian relationship. And 
so, maybe it™s only insurance, you know, since I don™t

know wh at™s up there or down  below, goi

Q: This is a continuation of the 
United Sta tes 
Holocaust Memorial Museum 
volunteer collection interview with 
Kristina Belfoure.
 This is tape number five, side
 
B
. Do you th ink you would be a different 
person today if you ha
dn™t gone thro ugh 
the experien ces that you went thro
ugh as a young Œ young woman? 
A: Well, definitely I would. In the first 
place I wouldn™t have met so many people 
and learned that among the bad ones, there 
are good ones. And that people are all the 
same, no matter where they are. And you 
Œ you have to  forgiv e the bad ones and 
have Œ thank God th at you met some good one
s. And basically that before I always 
thought that the only go
od people were Polish pe Œ I me
an Poles, whether they were 
Mosaic or Catholic. But then 
when you go out in 
the world, you learn that people are 
all the same, in a way, that 
they are formed by their cultu
res. And langua
ge brings Œ 
that the characteristics, that 
they just have Œ they™re in
fluenced by their language, by 
their cultures, but basically wh
en  you go down  to it, they™re
 si Œ they™re all the same, 
good and bad. And you-your 
Œ wh en you have your own 
children you try to make 
them citizens of the world so that we see 
that everybody is Œ that we all human and 
you™re never really successful, because so
metimes, I see by my own son that not all 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure  
February 2, 2001 

 

 
 
168
people are the same Œ or have the same
 value in his eyes. 
So I wasn™t very 
successful, although I tried. But there™s not
hing th at we can do but hope, and try to 
be better. And I tried, and so metimes I fa
ll back and say bad things about other 
people. I try not to, but that™s
 a ve ry human thing, you bl
ame somebody else for your 
own unhappiness and so Œ but I never, never 
made a difference between a Jew, or a 
Catholic or a German or a French, or
 an English if she was a good person. 
Q: Because of what you went
 through as a Œ a young woma
n, has that affected you 
politic Œ politically? 
A: Which one are you Œ a woman? 

Q: Well, your experiences in 
Poland
 and in 
Germany
, and so forth. Has that Œ do 
you think that™s aff
ected you politically? 
A: Well, of course I would never be a 
comm unist. And I think th at demo cracy, 
guard ed by public schools, 
and education in  public sc
hools is the best way of 
governing. But I also know that power a
nd greed can buy certain rights and political 
power, and that you have to watch out for 
th at. Because I™m too old to  do anything 
about it, but if Œ one thing I know for sure, 
that I always will be
 voting, because if 
you don™t vote, you Œ 
you have nothing to comp lain 
about later on, if things go 
wrong. And sometimes you 
get your Œ you don™t get 
Gore
, you get 
Bush
, but you 
have to put up with it, cause
 you know, four years from n o
w he can get Œ he gave his 
Œ if he was good, he stays, if he wasn™t, 
can go out. So I Œ I Œ politically Œ but then I 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure

169
always was sort of a Œ maybe not a demo crat, but I was mo re Œ I always saw 
injustice in the world, and I just always thought that Œ and I think that the 

government is the only place really in th
is Œ th at can help  p-people, and Œ in 
whatever situations. And so  I don™t Œ 
I think I would neve
r be one of those 
government haters, and no matter Œ but y
ou have to watch it, 
you can™t just let 
government do what they want to do if it™s 
not right. So that™s politics, that™s w h at I 
am. 
Q: Would you ju st Œ if so
meone asked you, are you Po
lish or American, how would 
you answ er? 
A: First I would say I™m a human, a woman 
and th en I would say a teacher and then 
I would say a mo ther and th en I would say of
 Polish origin. That™s
 what I would say. 
Q: Would you say 
you™re American? 
A: Oh, if Œ if I am abroad I am alw ays 
an American. I mean, here if somebody Œ 
cause here is this business of Polish-Ameri
can, Spanish-American, 
that kind of stuff. 
Now they  came up with African-Amer
ican. If they ever
 been in the 
Africa
 they 
know that there are 50 nations at least. 
But I am Americanized
. I do keep some 
Polish traditions, but Œ 

Q: Such as? 
A: Ah, such was this, before
 Christma s eve, wh
en you have this Œ they call this 
vigilia
(ph), that™s the vigil of Christma s a
nd you take th is white waffle and you

break it with whoever is with you and you 
say forg ive me and be brothers again and 
all this kind of stuff. I find this a very ni
ce custom. And let™s see, what else? That™s 
about all that I really believe
 in when it goes for Œ and of course there™s the language 
that ties me to 
Poland. 
Q: What Œ what langua
ge do you think in? 

A: I really don™t know, I think ever since I have fallen, math, definitely first P o lish. 

When  it goes for counting, I count in Polish.
 But otherwise, I th
ink in the language 
that I am speaking. 
But when Œ since I™ve 
fallen on my head, 
and I s-sometime Œ and 
I speak with a person who knows both lan
guages, I™m n o t sure whether I can keep 
with Œ in  one language. I never have that 
trouble with  French because I know they Œ 
this Œ oh yeah, there™s a Spanish, but I mean, that doesn™t bother me. But since I 

never learned Italian very well and I don™
t know Spanish very well, I ran Œ really 
never know what you Œ whether 
I™m speaking Span ish or Italian, but Œ so I avoid it. 
But I think that I basically Œ I don™t know
. Now right now I am talk ing English to 
you, so I think in English. 

Q: When  you go back to 
Poland
, what are your thoughts 
about the country now, and 
do you feel yourself at home wh en you™re there? 
A: Well, I haven™t 
been in this new 
Poland
, but you ni Œ I alwa
ys knew that nobody 
liked wh at was going on th ere, cause you can 
hear all those jokes, the taxi drivers 
always told Œ tell you th e joke
s. And you still see this dis
like of the Soviets. Well, 

 
Interview with Eva Kristine Belfoure  
February 2, 2001 

 

 
 
171
not so mu ch  Soviets, like the Russians. And 
I speak Œ I Œ I Œ I really Œ not that I miss 
Poland
, but I have love for it, for my begi
nnings and Œ on Œ but
 now on the other 
side I™m very Œ I love 
America
 because it gives a chance, those of us who were su Œ 
couldn™t go back or didn™t want to go back  to 
Poland
, gave us a new beginning. It™s 
like a Œ it™s like a promised land, in a way.
 And of course, not everybody™s life was a 
paradise on the country. So me people had a 
very, very hard life. Not I, not that Œ 
being not excluded. Bu t yeah, it™s a country  th
at gave us a chance to be something.  
Q: Mm-hm. I notice you™re wearing a pin 
that says teach er for the millennium.  
A: Oh yeah. 

Q: Was that an award that you received? 
A: When  Œ no, it™s Œ one of my  students gave me, and send it from 
California
 and 
they says, make sure you wear it, and 
so Œ because I was meeting her aunt or 
somebody, I wore it, cause she Œ I knew 
Œ and then I forgot to take it off. 
Q: I™d like to have you read, or Œ or me read
 this last paragraph in the book that you 
wrote, called,
 ﬁIn the Shadow of Dora
,ﬂ and see if you have any con Œ comments 
after.  
A: Well, ﬁWe the ones who lived through th
e terror, and those who would learn of it, 
when the temptation of conquest and power 
presents itself, rememb
er the terror. Will 
they remember the sacrifice of 50 million 
people during the conflict began by the 
Nazis, no matter what the revisionists say?
 Will they remember
 the Holocaust and

the warning of the changing wheel of fort
une? We learn so little fro m history, and 
repeat the same old horrible mistakes, again 
and ag ain. I know only that I would not 
want to forget the good of the few people in 
No rdha usen
, nor would I want to fail 
telling others about them.ﬂ 
Q: That™s beautiful. Is there anyt
hing you wanted to add to that? 
A: Well, no. I just hope that we never Œ 
that our children and our grandchildren will 
never have to suffer or see others suffer a
nd not do anything about it. And that this 
whole horror was brought to me by this death of 
Jan Karski
, who Œ who tried so 
bravely to  na Œ to Œ to tell the world ab
out wh at™s going on and nobody would listen 

to him. And wh enev er I think about har Œ an
d about how this man felt, that he failed, 
he Œ in his life, because despite all he 
tried, he couldn™t move anybody to do 
anything. On  the other hand, I don™t know wh
at he expected people to do, and wh at 
could have been done. But i-it™s ju
st he, when I first saw him, o-on
 Lehrman
 
Miles 
with us, his goodbye dinner or something, 
you know, and he Œ he
 was talking about 
how Mr. 
Lehrman
 
Miles 
help him after his wife died, and th en Mr. 
Miles 
said the 
same thing about him, how wonderful
 Karski
 was, and how a courag eous man. But 
I know that he felt, yeah, from the talk Œ 
talking Œ from talking 
with him, he knew 
that he felt that he really didn™t Œ didn™t do 
Œ th at he failed to do what he wanted to 
do. But then, it™s easy to ju
dge again, without knowing.
 And even  American Jewry 
didn™t do anything, but on the other hand 
I understand they were afraid of a

backlash. And so  this worl Œ life is so 
complicated. There™s no such a thing like a 
easy, straight line. And everybody brings in
to this life his own dislikes and likes, his 
own ideas, and they always in conflict with
 somebody else™s. And the wisdom is Œ or 
would be, t-to do the right thing, but how 
many of us think about it? Not everybody 
can think that clearly and 
long distance. Then we ha
ve our own problems, and 
everybody™s involved in  our own life and 
pr Œ solving our problems, and it™s not 
easy to live. So that™s why 
probably people are believi
ng in God, because this Œ 
without knowing th at Œ believing that there 
is something up th ere, or wherever, in 
space, life would be worthless. That™s it. 
Q: Is there any message you wanted 
to leave to your grandchildren? 
A: My grandchildren? Love
 the people around you and be truthful to yourselves, 
especially. 

Q: Well, that™s a lovely note to end 
on. Thank you very 
much for doing the 

interview. 
A: You™re very welcome.
