Marcel Drim er was born in Drohobycz Poland a small town now partof  Ukraine.  T he arrow on this

Marcel andhism otherLaura in 1934.  Germ any and the Soviet Union attacked Poland beginning 

W orldW ar II. T his isan historicalphotograph of  Germ an troopsparading throughW arsaw af terthe 

surrender of  Poland.  On June 22, 1941, Germ any violated the Germ any
-
Soviet pact andattacked 
S o vie t te rrito ry. W it
hin af ew weeks Drohobycz was occupiedby Germ anf orces.  In 1942 mem bers 

of  Marcel'sf am ily, including his grandfatherwhom  we see here, were deported to exterm ination 

cam ps where they were murdered.  In thefall of  1942 Marcel andhis fam ily were f orced into the 

Drohobycz ghetto.  Here we see an historicalphotographof  Jews being f orced into the Drohobycz 

ghetto. Before the liquidation of the ghettoT fam ily escaped to a small vil lage.  In August 1943 

Marcel went into hiding with a Polish Ukrainianf am ily.  Marcel's fam ily is seen in thisphototaken in 

1947 or 1948.  From  left to right we see Marcel's uncleAbraham  Drim er,his parents,Laura and 

Jacob, and Marcel's uncle Abraham  Gruber. 
 

In 1957 Marcel earned a degree inm echanical engineering.  He immigrated to the UnitedStates in 

1961 where his wif eAnia joined him  in 1963.  Soon afterarrival in the US he was hiredby the US 

Post Office Departm ent to work on thedesign of m ail sorters and conveyers.  Af ter a very s uccessf ul 

period with the post office department, Marcel transf erred to the US Arm y as a civilian in 1972.  He 

then worked as
 
a mechanical engineer for the Arm y Corps of Engineers. AlthoughMarcel off icially retired f rom  the 

Arm y in 1994 he rem ained a consultant with the Arm y until 2010. He is now truly retired, although not 

entirely true because of the work he doesfor them useum.

Marcel Drim er:  Likewise.
 
Bill Benson:  You have so muchto share with us that we'll start right ah way. W orldW ar IIbegan 
when Germ any attacked Polandf rom  the west quickly f ollowed by being attackedby Russianf rom  

theeast.  Early in the war you and yourfam ily li ved underoccupation.  Bef ore we turn to that time of 

the war, tell usa little bit about your lif e, yourfam ily, your com munity in the years before the 
wa r .
 
Marcel Drim er: T he town where I was born,Drohobycz, was Poland when I was born.  Itwas also 

Hungary when m y parents were born in early 20th century, and now it's Ukraine. So, you know, the 

place stays put inone placebutthe borders shift all around. Andthis is sort of a quitetypicalf or 

central andeastern Europe until now.  Now we can see Poland istrying to do som ething sim ilar.  But 

that'snotthe subject at allf or our conversation.
 
(Laughter)
 
Bill Benson: Som e things don't change.
 
Ma rc e l
 
Drim er:  Somethings never change. No m atterhow hard we work f or them to change.  So 
Drohobycz, the population of Drohobycz was about 40,000peopleand there were about 12,000 

Poles,about12 to 15,000 Ukrainiansandabout13,000 Jews in Drohobycz.  The
 
relations with the 
neighbors weref riendly.  T he Jews had theirown clubs, their own libraries, they hadevena high 

school,a Jewish highschool,and theaters.  It was quite a cultural
 
--
 
culture town.  Mostof  the Jewish 
population in Drohobycz were religious Jews who m ade their lifef rom  being tailors and craf tsm en and 

m erchantsbut there was alsoa groupof  Jews that were m oreassim ilated.  They spoke goodPolish, 

they were doctors, lawyers and leaders of the comm unity. 
 

At that tim e, starting in1933,
 
Germ any became what it was during the Holocaust, Hitler cam eto 
power and some of his ideas were spreadingall over the world and it also came to Poland. So there 

were groups in Polandthat were supporting what Hitler was preaching and the lif e of the Je
ws  
becam ea littlem ore dangerousor not as comf ortableas it was before. There were

there was, f or

exam ple, something called numerus clausus, where Jewish students go to collegeand the Polish
 
--
 
the Jewish, the Jews, could not be off icers in the Poli
shArm y.  They could be privates and junior 
NCOs butnotoff icers.  And soforth. Sothose that wanted to study, they would have to go to western 
Europe and study.  And m y wife's parents

m y wif e'sfather was a doctor,educated in Franceand 
Swit zerland
.  

Bill Benson: Becausehe could not getthe education in Poland.
 
Marcel Drim er:  Because he could not get education in Poland. So it was, you know, we had
 
--
 
we  
had nice synagogues and did
 
--
 
life was norm al until
 
--
 
Bill Benson:  Marcel, what was your father's occupation?
 
Marcel Drim er:  My f ather was an accountant in a lum berf actory but healso was a lum ber technician.  

He would go to the woods anddeterm ine what
 
--
 
what trees wouldbe ready for
 
--
 
for thefactory and 
guide them and bring them to
 
--
 
yo
u know, som eother people brought these

cut them down and 
brought them . And I rem em ber once in the wintertime he tookm e with him  to lookat thesetrees, this 

was before the war, Im usthave beenf our or f ive years old,andon a sled, horse

, a n d I 
was so enchanted with that that Ididn't even tell m y father thatm y toes were f reezing, you know.  I 

f roze a couple of m y toes but I was very happy to go on thattrip.
 
Bill Benson:  Marcel, shortly af ter the Germ ans invadedPolandonSeptember 1, 1939.  On the 17th 

of  September, Russiaattacked Poland andas a resultof  that you and yourf amily would live under 

Russian occupationuntil 1941. T ellus when thatperiodof  tim e waslike when the Russians came in 

andoccupied your com munity and what lifewas like f or you under the Soviets.
 
Marcel Drim er:  Yes, the Russiansattacked Poland onSeptem ber 17, 1939, only 17 days af ter the 

Germ ans attack. T here was a moment of agreement of non
-
aggression between Russia and the 
Germ ans. So the Russians attacked Polandandm ost of the Polishdef enseforces were on the 

western sidef ighting the Germ ans so the Russians just wentthrough the eastern part of Poland.

T hey took prisoners ofwar, about25 thousand prisoners of  war. T hey released the lower r ank 
s o ld
iers but they kept the officers in camps, in POW cam ps,and they killed them in the Katyn Forest 
on April 10,1940. This is a very tragic date in the history of  thePolish

of  Poland. 22,000 off icers 
were killed in that Katyn cam p. Som e of them

mo s
t of thesepeople were civilians thatwere 
prof essionals andduring the war they were takento theArm y andam ong them were some Jewish

theytried to im pose comm unism  on thepopulation. T hey

Marcel Drim er: W ell, they didn't really join, they were draf ted.
 
Bill Benson: They wer e draf ted into it.
 
Marcel Drim er:  Maybe I'll come to that.
 
Bill Benson: So you lived underthe Soviet occupation until 1941.  But soon after Germany turned on 

the Soviets in June1941, German troops cam e in to Drohobycz andf or Jews there, lif e changed 

even m ore dram atically and quickly.  T ell uswhat it was like once the Germ ans came in and they

September 29 until the end of the war and the Germans started the

the exterm ination of the Jews

theW arsaw Ghetto was opened in1940and thepogrom sand killings were

going on.  So when the
 
--
 
when the Germansattacked Poland inthe
 
--
 
in '41, June22, 1941, m y 
s ib lin gs
 
--
 
m y f ather was the oldest of f ive siblings andm y m other was the oldest
 
of four siblings.  So 
som e of the siblings ofm y f ather's, the men, all of the menthat were at the
 
--
 
ata certain age, Im ean, 
you know, all of  them were, were taken tothe Russian Arm y and two of m y aunts with children of two 
or three months, Ryf ka and
 
Mirka,f ollowed the Russian Arm y as they retreated to Russia. Of the 
uncles that were taken to the Russian Arm y, two of  them foughtanddiedon the f rontand the others 

survi ved, another three survi ved and came back to Drohobycz.  At the end
 
--
 
this was
 
--
 
they were 
ver y brave becausethe children were ver y s m all and they knew wh at waitedfor them  if the Germ ans 

cam e so they
 
--
 
so they lef t with the RussianArm y and they also survi ved.  Andthose thatwere 
deported, likef orexample my wif e's parentswere
 
deported, they
 
--
 
and she was born actually in 
Siberia because she
 
--
 
herf ather was adoctor so hedelivered her so there were
 
--
 
they also 
survi ved.  So it was sort of ironic that thesepeople were actually saved by deportation.  90% of  those 

that were deported toSiberia survived, or m aybe 85%. On theother hand, thosethat stayed in 

Poland, about 90% were killed.  So now we
 
--
 
Bill Benson:  Now theGerm ans com e in now.
 
Marcel Drim er: T he Germans cam eto
 
--
 
before the Germ ans cam e to Drohobycz and moved our 
territories, they contacted Ukrainian national groups under
 
--
 
don't rem em ber his name, and they 
agreed with the Ukrainian
 
--
 
Ukrainians supported Germ an attackbecausethey thought the Germans 
wi ll gi ve them  their independent country, which never
 -- 
which they never planned to do.  And so 
they
 
--
 
they contacted the Ukrainian nationalists and told them that thef irst day af ter they com eto 
Drohobycz to m ove toother towns, they could do whatever they wa nt to
 
--
 
with the Jews and their 
property.  So in Drohobyc z when the Russians were leading, they killed about100 of the Ukrainian 

nationalists and left their bodies in the m iddleof  the town andput out a rumor that the Jews did it. So 

with the agreement of the Germ ans to put

no t to lo o ka t it, the
 
Ukrainians started apogrom ,a, you

know, slaughter of the
 
--
 
of the Jews in Drohobycz and they were
 
--
 
t hey brought very prim itive, 
uneducatedpeasantsfrom  nearby villages and they went f rom  Jewish hom e to Jewish home and 
beat peopleupand took their things that they wanted to take.  Oneof the victim s was m y m other's 

father who was beaten so badly thathediedten days later becausethere was no access to doctors, 

there was no medication. But the robbers, whenthey lef tm y grandfather's

they took whatever they wanted to take am ong their things. T hings they took were the album s of 

photos. They didn't need thephotos,they just wanted to take the leather
-
bound album s, so they 
shookout the photos in the mudonthe ground anda neighbor, Ukrainianneighbor, Mr.
 
Ku tskoff 
pickedup these photos and kept them.  After the war m yf ather went to see what was lef tof the 

grandparents' house and of course everything was ruined. But thegentleman came out and gave m y 

father about 50 photo

Bill Benson:  Som e of  which we saw.

we only saw one but

T he one that I am  withm y mother in the carriage, picture was takenAugust of 1934.  And Idonated 

all these photos tothe Holocaust museum and if  anybody's interested, if  you Google m y nam e, you

thing I would like you to talkabout, if you don't m ind, is when you went with your nanny, if you 

wouldn't m ind telling us that.
 
Marcel Drim er:  Yes, yes, yes, of  course.  Sosituation in our housewas quite critical.  T heGerm ans, 

when they came, they put outthe rules of existence. T he Jews wer e not allowed to sit in the parks, 

the Jews were notallowed to walk on the sidewalks but in them iddle of  the road. T hey we re

they 
we
re supposed to wear Star of David on their arm bands or on their jackets.  And soonand sof orth.  
T here was also a system  of food rationsthat people were entitled to about 200 calories perday.  Can 

you im agine that?  Som y

so she did.  I went to her and two or three days later m y sister, m y sister Irena, startedbothering m y 
m other about I wantmy brother back, I want to play with m y brother. W hy don't we get and pick up 

andbring him backhom e?  And so m y mother said okay, we'll do it.  And she took off herarm band, 

which was

if  she would be caught, she would be killed im mediately.  T his was a

a crim ethat, you

we went

wi t h  m y 
sister she went to Jancia.  And Jancia was pregnantat that time and was in labor exactly at the

d .  
I was absolutely of no help. Andm y m other

so m y m other started boiling water anddidwhat she 
coulddo. Because there was no

there was no talk of getting a doctor or evena

B ill B e n s on :   Mid wif e.
 
Marcel Drim er:  Mid wife or anything like thatbecause we were Jewi sh and this was dangerous.  So 

m y m other helped deliver the baby, but thebaby was stillborn.  And then it sortof becameevening, 

so Jancia said why don't you stay with us and you'll go home tomorrow.  So we stayed there, and the 

ne
xt m orning her husband came backf rom  work, he was working the night shift, andhe was terribly 

surprised andunhappy to see us there.  He says there is an aktion. The Germans called them 

aktions. T here were a killing aktion and robbing aktion. T his was
 
akilling aktion.  He said the 
Germ ans are killing the Jews.  They are gathering them , taking them  to the cam ps and if  they would 

com e here and see you, we would all bedead.  Youhave to

youhave to leave.  You have to go.  
So he gave m y m other a coupleof  slicesof  breadand told us to go. T here was a dirt road in thef ront 

of  the house and then there were wheatf ields.  It was August of 1942, wheat f ields and then there

Early in them orning we leftand went to lookfor a place to hide.W e didn't get to the woods because 
there

m y m otherf ound the indentation inthe groundand this is where we

this is where we laid 
down.  And Mother had a raincoat that was the color of  the ripe wheat, covered usthere and we lay 

there quietly waiting for what would happen. And soon we startedhearing the Germans scream ing 

rous!  Rous! W hich meansout.  And shots. Andpeople

people scream ing of pain andbe
ggin g of  
m ercy and shots again and it lastedm aybe15 or 20m inutes and then it quieted.  And then another 

m aybe another half  hour later the same story.  It wasf ourorf ive times.  My sister called that the 

sym phony of pain, sym phony of terror. About7:00, 8:00 in the evening it stopped. T he scream ing 

and shouting and shooting stopped, and so we got up, waited until another hour or so.  And we got up 

and started walking toward Jancia's house.As we cam e tothe road, looked aroundandthere was a 

Germ an 
soldier with abig dog and so we thought this is it.  You know, he would

eyes.  It was in thefamily.  He looked at the two wom enand didn't seem ebecausem y Jewish nose 

would gi ve m e away, and he just turnedaround and walkedaway.  You know, it was sort of  am iracle, 

but I think there's two reasons
 
that it went like that.  Norm ally the Germ ans would go in pairs. T hey 
never went hunting forpeople single because

because they couldget a human reaction and sortof  
try to save the person andthe other one would squeal on him . But he was by himself. There was 

nobody that could tellhis commander that he let som epeople live, so he turnedaround and walked 

away.

the Germ ans put them  on an um shatz platz, a place where they kept them for two days without

sorry.  Father realized that the ghetto would soon be liquidated because the plans of 
Germ ans were ver y
 
we ll
-
known, so he decided thathehasto takeus out of the ghetto and hide us.  
W hilehe was working i n the lum berfactory he prepared a placef orus to hide. He also putsom e 

planksof  thefence down and preparedf orus to get there.  Hebribed the policeman that took
 
--
 
what 
they did, the Jews li ved in the ghettobut they worked in all kindof  places,all over Drohobycz.  So a 

policeman came to a certain place like5:00 in them orning and the Jews were waiting there to be 

taken to their places.  And th
ey would take them to each
 
--
 
each group to adiff erent placeand in the 
evening he would pickthem  up also.  So Father one day, oneother person wasn't supposed to come, 

so Father tookm y m other, got dressed in aman's clothesand tookm y sister under her
 
arm  and 
Father tookm e underhis arm.  Of  course we were ver y, ver y thin, if you can imagine,200calories a

his factory.  He put

he put us behind som e bushes across the

f rom  the fence to the lumber 
factory and said to

said to me, you stay here.  You 
are them an now, and I'll take Mother and Irena and take them  inside thefactory and thenI'll com e 

andpick you up.  As soonas he got up and lef t with them ,I got quite panicky.  I heard som e stories
 
about parents leaving their childrenbehindand I wasn't really a man.  I was eight years old,a scared, 

hungry kid.  So I started running af term y father scream ing "
D

father had to turn around andpick me up,and there was a guard,of course, who started telling m y

I 'm  no t  an gr y f

that you saw that I could leave you.  How could you think that I could leave you. W ell, anyway, we 
cam e tothef actory and we

the place was prepared f or us. It was a attic of a big drying shed where 
the wood was drying.  So we were there on the
 
--
 
on the attic and Father would come at night.  He 
would com e and bringus som efood and take the wastedown on strings, you know.
 
Bill Benson: And just so we know, understand, thishiding place heconstructed,hehad it inside the

in
 
the shed where the wood was drying.
 
Bill Benson: And there you are hiding in there.
 
Marcel Drim er:  Yes.  So this ishow he gave us

heprovidedfood.  One day a
 
--
 
af riend of  his, a 
wom an, young wom an, approachedhim andsaid thisotherf riend of m ine,Theresca, says that she 

suspects you.  She says I don't know whether you have anybody ornot,but she suspects that you 

have somebody hiding hereat the camp,at thefactory, and she says that if  she

she just hasto 
determ ine that it's
 
--
 
that she's correctand she will do the right thing. W hat shem eantby the right 
thing is todenounce them  to the Germansfor a kilo off lour or sugarper person. That's what the 

bounty for Jews was at that time.  Father was

again, what to do. There's no place to run. My f ather 
hadaf riend who was a physician andhe was thedirectorof  the little clinic that they have in that 

fa cto ry.  A nd  ta lk
ed tohim  and said we have to com eup with som e

with some solution. T he doctor 
was educated inVienna, spoke German perf ectly, and he cam etoaver y ingenuous plan.He wrote a 

letter as

anonym ouslet that are he's an SSoff icer on leave andthat he
 
hadan encounter with this 
wom an and she infected him  with syphilis.

T he next day the

was.  And of course he certified that this is indeed
 
--
 
I don't know the m edi

buthe certif ied yes, indeed, she has to be put away because she'sa danger to the society, especially 
to the SS menbecause they were ver y touchy about things like that. W ell, she was put away not to 

be seenuntil after thewar.
  
So this was a
 
--
 
th is wa s a
 
--
 
anotherm iracle in our survival.
 
Bill Benson: And Marcel, given thatm iracle,of  course yourf ather realized that you just could not stay 

therepermanently.  So he had tof indanother placefor you. So weabsolutely, I know you want to tell 

us about going to theSawinskis.
 
Marcel Drim er:  Absolutely.  Not only this was nota long
-
term hiding place because people could see 
butalso the Germ answere going to liquidate the work cam psandeverybody
 
--
 
e ver ybody would 
have to go. Som yf ather took his armband off and as I said
 
--
 
well, the Jewish m en were in danger 
going out of the ghettoor going out of the working place because only the Jews were 
circu m cise d 
in  
Poland. And if  aGerman ora policeman suspected a man to be Jewish, he would just say drop your 

pants and you are guilty, if you are 
circum cised  
you are guilty of  being a Jew.  But he tookoff his 
arm band, went todiff erent
 
--
 
to the village actually where m y m other was born, and talked to certain 
people. And som e were not sonice,they askedfor his watch or they'l l gi ve him
 
--
 
denounce him.  
Finally he went to af am ily that knew m y m other since she was a little girl and they were very f riendly 

andthey agreedto take us. Of  course, they

the deal was that Mrs.
 
Sa

so m yf ather was

would have to stay with f ather and goto camp together with us or go with my sister and save m y

Mrs .
 
Sawinski said, " Ican't take itanym ore. W hatever wil l be will b e. T ake the boy with you."  So by

the town and so we allwent thereand there was about 350 of us.  People camef rom the woods,f rom  

hiding with f arm ers. It was about12to 13,000 Jews in Drohobycz.  T here were those whocam e later 

that survi ved in Russia.  One of m y uncles was taken prisoner of  war.  He was in the Russian Arm y

som e of the crystals and askedaf riend, jeweler, tomakea ring that looks likea diamond ring.  And 

the f riend did it and wh
enm y uncle went to ask theSawinskis to take him  in, he gave him  the ring.  

He said this is adiam ond ring.  You know, yo u can just keep that ring but because Mr.
 
Sawinski said

I know our audience does too, Marcel,that we had more tim e with you because

It's our tradition at

going toturn back 
to Marcel to close our program . Because we didn'thave an opportunity f or you to ask some

Marcel Drim er:  I'm  talking to you and otherswho want to listen tome because there are people and 

organizations who claim  thatthe Holocaust is a hoax, that it never happened, thatthe Jews m ade it 

up to getm oney f rom  the Germ ans. I am  witness that it didhappen.  By listening to the stories of m y 

childhood, you'll becom e witnessesalso. Our goodf riend,the late Charlene Schiff, which you knew

behaviors is the pathto preventing Holocausts and genocides, andthis is what this Holocaust 

m useum  is all about.  I also want to read youwhat Pastor Niem ollersaid, " First they cam efor the 

socialists and Idid not speakout because I was not a socialist. Then they cam efor the tra
de 
unionists, and I didnot speak out because I was not atrade unionist.  Then they cam ef or the Jews, 

andI did not speak out becauseI was nota Jew.  T hen they camefor m e, and there was no one left 

to speakfor me."
 
W e cannot be bystanders. W e have t
o be active in tryin g to prevent genocides, hom icides, hatred of 
all kind.  Racism of  all kind. T hank you.
