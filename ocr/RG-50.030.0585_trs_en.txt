Question: This is a United States Holocau
st Memorial Museum interview with Mr. 
Eugene Miller on September 13, 
2010.  Thank you, Mr. Miller, 
for agreeing once again to 
be interviewed by us.  We appr
eciate the time you took the fi
rst time, and we appreciate it 
now.  And, like always with our interview, we
 want to start at the very beginning like in 
the fairy tales.  So where were you born -- yo
ur parent's names, what their professions 
were, a little bit description of the 
world you were bor
n into.      
 
Answer: Okay.  I have to st
art even first.      
 
Q: Before.  That's  okay.      
 
A: My mo th er was born in Merecz, Lithuania.
  My father was born in Moscow, Russia.  
Generally, since Lithuania was 
occupied by Russia -- or was 
part of Russia there -- they 
took -- they draft the young boy
s for 25 years to serve in 
Russia army.  My grandfather 
evidently was well-off, and he sent his sons 
to United States.  My mother was sent to 
Moscow to study in th
e Moscow University. 
 When the Revolution 
came, sh e g o t married  
and lived in communist Russi
a till 1923.  In 1923, Leni
n decreed that the small 
bourgeoisie should be liquidated, and th ey st
arted to arrest and so forth.  Anyway, my 
grandfather and my  father, my  grandmother -- 
they all fled to Pola
nd.  My grandfather 
was killed.  They went -- they got wounded.
  Anyway, they got 
to Poland near the 
Russian-Romanian-Polish bou
ndary, and they settled in L
odz, L-O-D-Z, Poland.  My 

mother went to Lithuanian boun
dary, and she was expecting me. 
 
Q: So your parents were married already?      
 
A: She was -- she was -- oh, sure.  She was 
late 19 months.  And she said, "Look, my  
husband is dead.  I'm going to my  parents.
  They wait for me to go."  I was born in 
Merecz.  You know at that time people not regi
stered right away when
 they were born.  
They  waited for kids to surviv e.  Anyway , ma
king long story short, 
as long as she could -
- she went to Poland, wrote my father.      
 
Q: First, let's say,
 were born in Merecz, Merkine?      
 
A: But I wasn 't registered.      
 
Q: What date were you born?      
 
A: Oh, I was born -- officially, I w as regi
stered in October 16, 1923.      
 
Q: October 16, 1923.      
 

A: Yeah.      
 
Q: But you were born a fe
w days before.      
 
A: That's right.      
 
Q: Do you know how many 
days before?      
 
A: No.      
 
Q: I know, my mother is the same.      
 
A: You know.  I mean, 
that really didn't  --
 
Q: Wait a minute for a second -- wait, wait, wait.      
 
A: Oh, I am sorry.  By somebody  from Holocaust Museum.      
 
Q: Oh, really?      
 
A: Years, years ago.      
 
Q: Years ago.      
 
A: That's right.  But anyway -- 
coming back to this --      
 
Q: So your mo ther gave 
birth to you October 16, 1
923 officially --      
 
A: Yeah.      
 
Q: -- and then joined her hus
band in Borch[?].      
 
A: Yeah, she joined me, and I was regist
ered  as a child in Poland.      
 
Q: So you were the oldest
 of the family.      
 
A: I was the only child.      
 
Q: You were the only child.      
 
A: Yep.      
 
Q: Okay .  I'm not letting you do that yet.  I 
want to find out a little bit more about your 
father.  What did he do for a living?  Did y
our mo ther help him?  Did she do something 
else?      
 
A: No, we were quite well off.  We had a fact
ory. And they manufact
ured -- they weaved 
materials, y ou know?      
 
Q: Like ricotash[?] -- something like that?
 

A: Yeah.  And we were very comfortable.  
I don't know if -- anyway, I was sent to, in 
Poland, to gymnasium.  This is equivalent
 of academy  in this country .      
 
Q: Like a high school -- something like that?      
 
A: Yeah, that's right.  But 
very  expensive one. So Œ
 
Q: I want to go even  back further.  Sorry. 
 I want to ask you, "What are your earliest 
memo ries that you can recall from your ch
ildhood?  From your mo th er?  From your 
father?"  I want to get a sense 
of where you grew up.      
 
A: Could you take that off?      
 
Q: Okay , we can pause.  We will pause.  A
ll right. Let's -- this is a photograph of you 
with your mo ther. About how ol
d were you here?      
 
A: I imagine probably  two, three years old.  
I cannot tell.  My guess is as good as yours.  
Bu t my  un cle sen t  me  t h e 
photograph, so --      
 
Q: She lo oks very ch ic, very elegant in th
e style of the time -- your mo ther.      
 
A: So I -- well, now I can continue.      
 
Q: Yes.      
 
A: So I grow up.  I was the only child.  Oh
, I was born in 1923 when the war late in 
October.  So, when the war started , I was st
ill in the gymn
asium or academy. And the 
Germans came.  After a few months, th
ey press us in the ghetto.      
 
Q: This was Olen Woj [?].      
 
A: Olen Woj, yeah.  The ghe
tto was -- when they left, th
e ghetto was something between 
like 2 and 250,000 people.  We
 were lucky enough -- we went
 here and there. We move 
to the area which was ghetto ab out two months a year.  What happened, since we had a 
very nice apartment and lived
 in a very good neighborhoo
d, the Germans used to 
requisition the apartment for the Germans wh
ich were expelled from Russia -- no, no.  

They came.  They 
told us that you have two hours.  
You can take wh atever you can carry 
in our hands.  And don'
t forget to leave the fl
owers on the table.  [chuckling].  Okay.  We 
went, and we were able to re
nt a room in the only building which has a flushing toilet in 
the ghetto.  One room.  Okay.      
 
Q: Tell me -- your father lost his busin
ess when the Germans came in?      
 
A: They took it away -- sure.      
 
Q: They took it away.      
 

A: Yeah.  They put it troiken[?] there, which 
is whatever that administrator, and -- well, 
okay.  I was in the ghetto, and they  are -- you 
see, there were a lot of Jewish kids who 
went to other gymnasiums -- who went to the 
public school and who 
went to other high 
school gymn asiums.  And they  
put us all together and allow 
us to continue in school, 
which was located in the part 
of Russ -- near the the cemete
ry called Marysin. M-A-R-Y-
S-I-N.  And then we continue to school till 194 
-- end of 1941.  At that time --      
 
Q: Hang on -- I have a few questions.      
 
A: Yeah.      
 
Q: Okay .  First question -- about the school
, the very prestigious gymnasium that you 
went to -- can you tell me a l
ittle bit about what th
is coursework was? What you studied?  
Was it a Jewish one?  Was it a Polish one?      
 
A: No.  No.  This school was a -- most of
 our teachers have Ph.D.s.  The school was 
recognized by Polish au thorities or govern
ment as a school which does not require 
examination for the entrance 
to university. So.      
 
Q: It was very hard.      
 
A: That's right.  And we get 
two type of abitur.      
 
Q: I know abitur -- so we mean
 high school diploma.      
 
A: Two type of high school diploma.  One 
was in Polish, and second was in Hebrew, and 
you could go from us -- you could go to Pa
lestine at that time and enter Hebrew 
University withou
t examinations.
 
Q: So it was nevertheless a Jewish school --      
 
A: Yeah, that's right.      
 
Q: -- you were taught Hebrew, and you we
re taught Polish as well?      
 
A: Yeah.  The head of school
s -- there were two, three scho
ols in Poland.  One that was 
in Lodz.  That was sometimes in schlunks.  
Silesia and some other place. And the head of 
school was a Polish -- she was appointed as 
a me mb er of the senate.  She was Polish 
senator. Okay.  Well, that was a mishmash
 for me -- the ghetto students came from 
various schools.  An yway.      
 
Q: My second question -- I'm so 
sorry for interrupting, but I ne
ed to get the context.  You 
spoke wh ich language at home?      
 
A: I spoke Polish.      
 
Q: And at school?      
 

A: My parents spoke Ru ssian among th emselves
.  To me they spoke Polish.      
 
Q: Polish.  And in sch
ool you studied in Polish and in  
Hebrew; is that correct?      
 
A: Yeah.      
 
Q: Okay .  Did you know any German?      
 
A: Yes.  I had it as a subject at high school
. German and high school English.      
 
Q: Those were my  other questions.  By the 
time you got into the mishmash of the ghetto 
school, I wanted to get a sense 
of how many languages --      
 
A: And I didn't -- you see -- if you want to
 know the sense, I will tell you how ghetto 
look.  The Jewish community 
was essentially split in two parts.  There was 250,000 Jews 
out of 600,000 people -- or 65
0,000 people. Half of them 
were hasidim, you know?  And 
we seldom even went to their neighborhood
, because they  spoke Yiddish . I didn't spoke 
Yiddish.  I had a problem.  I wen't one. I don'
t know why I went.  I was close there, and I 
went to the school.  And we all wore unifo
rms -- high school uniforms -- so I took my 
cap off.  And the guy took a br
oom to me an d wanted to chase me o u t.  How is a Jewish 
kid come and embarrass her friend?  I never we
nt there. This was mish -- both of these 
communities were mixed in th
e ghetto.  Well --      
 
Q: What was that like?      
 
A: What?      
 
Q: What was that like 
for a young boy -- well, teenage boy?      
 
A: Confusing.  Alth ough, I reme
mber as -- I wanted to go to 
-- I wanted to -- you see, one 
of the brothers of my father was left in Russi
a.  He didn't want to 
go. He joined
 evidently 
the party, become one of the editors of Isiest
ia [?] -- and he wrote to my father that "If 
you sent me there, I could -- he didn't 
have any ch ildren. He would send me to 
university."  Well --      
 
Q: What year did he write this?      
 
A: Beg your pardon?      
 
Q: When did your uncle write this?      
 
A: In 1939.  You know, when there wa
s still peace between Russia and between 
Germany.  My mo ther visited them in 19
38, and she did -- you kn
ow, they gave her 
permission, but the -- they were -- they had 
to have a guid e with them.  And the guide 
was probably member of NKGB
.  So, when she cam
e to see them, they
 saw the men who 
came with them -- they said, 
"Look, we are very happy that you are happy.  You have 
your life.  We have our life."  And my  mo th er
 understood what it is.  She cried when she 

came home.  And sh e -- "We wish you all the best,"
 and that was all.  Year later, after the 
war, you know?  He wrote to sent me there.  
Well, my father told 
me -- I wanted to go, 
we all go in Russian zone.  He said, "Look, 
you can go to Russia.  But, once you go, the 
door will open, but you never 
came back.  I fled once Russia,
 and I am not going.  The 
German are civilized people.  You know -- 
blah, blah.  And I sp
eak well German.  We 
will take our chances.  We want to last longer."  We
ll, when they ask us to 
put first the --      
 
Q: The armbands?
 
A: -- the armbands.  I told my father, "I'm not
 putting this."  I went out.  A Polish teacher 
recognized me and pointed to 
th e Germans.  And I came in, I was black and blue.  And I 
went into  hysteria.  I told 
my dad that he's g o ing to k
ill himself, your mom and me.  And 
then my father didn't said ve
ry much.  Next morning he sa
id, "Look, we really don't know 
what's going to happen. If you feel that you can 
save yourself, go."  They took my  shoes.  
They putted [sic] some gold pieces in this, a
nd they sent me.  Wh
en I went away, my 
mo m look at me and said, "Tak e a good lo ok at
 your parents.  You'll never see them 
again."  And I was a 15.5 years old boy -- clos
e to 16.  And it hit my head, you know?  I 
was -- I said, "If I survive and 
they die, how's I left my 
parents?"  I was on the Russia 
boundary, and you coul
d -- the Germans let people out at
 that time, and Russia admitted 
them.  And I went back.  When I went back
, when I came back, shortly enough we went 
into the ghetto. I --      
 
Q: Did your parents -- were they happy you ca
me back, or were they distraught that you 
came back?      
 
A: Would you repeat your
self?  If my --      
 
Q: Were they -- how did your parent
s react when you came back?      
 
A: They were delighted , and they were very
 happy. That's about all.  I mean, they 
regained back their son, and I was going to  
try.  But anyway, when
 we went into the 
ghetto, I understand Yiddish , and I can prob
ably speak halfway 
Yiddish and halfway 
German, you know?  But I spoke -- I never rea
lly learned.  Well, when they closed the 
school, I was at that time probably 17 years old.  And in the ghetto --      
 
Q: They closed the ghetto school.      
 
A: Yeah, that's right.  Well, 
close in ghetto, which was closed in 1940.  I continue my  
school education until September 1941.  Then  
they have -- then they  closed the school, 
and they send there the transport of Ge
rman and Czech Jews there.      
 
Q: Until that time, you had a mishmash.  But 
the mishmash was from 
Borscht [?]?   The 
mishmash was Jewish commun
ity from Borscht.  Nobody mixed in yet.      
 
A: No.      
 

Q: Nobody from any place else?      
 
A: No.      
 
Q: Okay.  What was that like?  Was Romkowsk i 
alrea dy the Jewish commu
nity leader?      
 
A: Oh yeah -- he was already.  That's right.      
 
Q: Can you tell me a little bit about him?  What 
you remember?  What did you see him?      
 
A: I can tell you a lot about him.  I lived u
nder his regime for 4.5 
years.  Till liquidated 
the ghetto. Romkowski -- all right.  Romkow
ski was a widower who was probably well 
comfortably, and he retired that he was on th
e board of orphanag es. 
 And he had his place 
by his wife, which was board ed ov
er there.  Over there it went to his head, and he started 
-- well, you know, he probably felt that the only
 way for the ghetto to
 survive is to -- not 
only to cooperate with the Germans, but to cr
eate industry in the gh
etto so they would 
become indispensable economically.      
 
Q: What kind of industry did 
he try to create?      
 
A: Beg your pardon?      
 
Q: What kind of industr
y did he try to create -- what ki
nd of economic basis?      
 
A: Oh -- oh, they made what you wanted. 
 They made the shoes.  They  made the 
garments.  They made the belts
. They made all kinds -- that was all army resource.  All 
come to this right here.      
 
Q: Your father was a well-to-do person.      
 
A: My father didn't want to be part
 of ghetto administration.      
 
Q: That was my question.      
 
A: He bring -- we brought enough money or wh
atever you had th at just to take care on 
ourselves.  Which you couldn't afford -- you
 couldn't affo rd -- food was extremely 
expensive.  What we get was a 2-kilogram 
bread for one week and maybe few potatoes.  
There was no coal, nothing.  People already star
ted -- the poorer people started to die out 
pretty early.  But Romk owski cr
eated industry, and people had to wo rk.  Because in order 
-- No. 1 -- we got a dose in school to get the 
soup.  They got the s
oup in addition to the 
bread, which they got -- at the wo
rking place.  When  the school
 -- and that -- I -- well, my 
address in the ghetto was Berka Jose
lewicza 60 Brunnenstrasse 16.      
 
Q: Brunnenstrasse 16.      
 
A: Berek Joselewicz was the hero of one
 of Polish uprisings.  They  renamed it 
Brunnenstrasse.  I told you 
that the ghetto was closed on 
1940.  I continued my high 

school education until Septembe
r '41.  And, when the scho
ol closed, I was assigned to 
labor department.  I was 17 or 18 
years boy.  I mean, you know, just out of school.  So  I -
- I did -- well, I worked in economic departme
nt that was call ed Vir turizam.      
 
Q: Hang on a second.  I want to ask a ques
tion about the school.  So it was a mi shmash 
you say.  What was the quality of the teache
rs for the year that it existed?      
 
A: That was a put-up faculty of the people -- 
a lot of people fled.  I mean, teachers from 
various schools -- Jewish, we're talking Po lish sc
hool and by us -- they made the -- they 
were our this.  One of our professors -- his 
name was Silverbogen -- he became the -- he 
became the principal of the school.  Well, a
nyway -- where I was?  When  the school 
ended, I did it whatever they asked me to do. 
 I filed.  I run erra
nds. My wo rking hours 
probably were from morni
ng till evening, close to ten hours a day.      
 
Q: What was the work of the Vir turizam?  
W h at was its purpose?  The place where you 
worked.      
 
A: They called Vir turizam?  They administer
ed -- well, it was one of the departments 
which he created.  I think th ey assigned 
the living quarters.  They make that 
administrative work.  That was --      
 
Q: So did you co me into daily contact w
ith him? With Romkow
ski?  No.      
 
A: No.  I saw him one time in person for a long
 -- in 1944.  I'll come
 to this.      
 
Q: Okay.      
 
A: Now.  I was there to about 
1942.  Then I was reassig n ed to
 work in court.  There was 
court.  And they -- you know, they really had th
at "people stole this," "people stole this."  
Mostly -- they were mostly 
-- there were no mu rder cases, 
you know?  There was crimes 
of property.  Well, I work ove
r there to about -- well, the ru
nning errands.  Don't forget 
there was no phone calls.  Those -- you know, 
if you wanted to talk to somebody five 
blocks away, either you went by yourself, 
or you scribble few word
s what you want and 
you summon a kid like me -- I took it over, I br
ought answ er, you know?  Well, in 1942, I 
got a job in a court.  And ag ain, I filed,
 you know?  And I run errands.      
 
Q: But you know, this seems lik
e -- pardon me for thinking, 
but it seems like fairly easy 
work  considering wh at kind of wo
rk it could have been .      
 
A: Oh yeah -- oh yeah -- oh yeah.  My cousin 
who was also in the ghetto; he was CPA in 
Vir turizam.  So he got me over there.  And,
 when there was reducti
on in force over there, 
because they wanted to have 
people to work in 
the resorts, which manufactured seats for 
the Germans.  He got me in the court.
  So I worked over there.      
 
Q: What did your father do du
ring this time?      
 

A: Noth ing.  Dying of slow hunger death.  
We bought it as long as we could.  As the 
money lasted. Don't fo rget -- in 1942, thebread costs over -- loaf of bread costs over 
$100, $150.  When the German
s troops came, they were qu
ite well-assimilated .  They 
were quite number of them were intermarri
ed.  Some came wit
hout something -- with 
wives, you know, that the -- or
 with the husband, who was German, didn't want in the 
ghetto. And I remember it would -- it is not co
mic.  It is tragic.  You know, when we 
were picking up, you had 
to work some place to
 get stamps.      
 
Q: Right.      
 
A: My father got stamps, because he was sick
, okay?  But -- so they
 got the stamps.  And 
they were going to the 
head of the line some 
of them.  And they said for science uda and 
the Reich uda[?] I am a German 
Jew -- and they expected that 
we let them eat.  Well, the 
people were not in the mood.  And this -- they
 were very brutally pus
hed to the end of the 
line.  And a lot of them committed  suicide. 
 Large number of them committed suicide.  
They couldn't take it.  Well, 
continue with me. I was -- in Ma
y 1943 -- I'll give you this -- 
I was transferred to the fire department.  Well, 
we were not a fireman.  I was a young kid.  
What our job there was, when 
we -- to walk, you know, in th
e resort -- when people sit by 
machines, sewing machines, and this -- see 
th at nobody smokes a ci garette, throws away, 
and if a fire would start and yo
u couldn't  put a bucket of water, we really had to  call the -- 
[pause] -- well -- well, we 
look for unsafe practic
e like smoking.      
 
Q: Almost preventative fire.      
 
A: That's right.  And, if the 
fire really started, we called 
the fire brigade who are trained 
as a firemen; they came and they 
took care of the fire.      
 
Q: Can I just ask one point for clarification?
 When you talk about 
a "resort," you're make 
-- you -- it sounds like you're talking abou
t a manufacturing department --      
 
A: Yeah.      
 
Q: -- not a resort.      
 
A: That's A rbeits Resort.  That's 
h o w they call in German.      
 
Q: So it would be like a manufacturing area, or a workplace.      
 
A: Shops.  Or minor factories.  That's mo
re like a factories, because they -- you might 
have people, 5, 600 people wo rk
ing this.  And, when they we
re doing shoes, they said 
when they all sat by sewing machine and 
another.  And we were moved around, you 
know?  I didn't work in the same place.  
Every day we were a
ssigned -- "You go here," 
"You go here," "You go
 there."      
 

Q: Were you ever -- was there any manufac
ture of German military equipment?  
Ammunition?      
 
A: A lot.  A lot.  There were uniforms.      
 
Q: Aha.      
 
A: There were torn uniforms, which proba
bly -- from people who died during the war.  
And there were -- they -- the Germans s
upplied the material.  They manufactured 
material uniforms.  The same th
ing with th e shoes.      
 
Q: What about weapons?  Munitions?      
 
A: No.  One thing which we didn't do.      
 
Q: Okay.      
 
A: But that was economic -- wh
at they Romkowsk i interested
 the union.  He wanted to 
make hims elf economically indispensable -- or near
ly indispensable -- to th
e war effort.      
 
Q: Did you see selections?  Were there 
selections in the Woj ghetto?      
 
A: Oh yeah.  Oh yeah .  They  demanded -- they  demanded  people who could wo rk and so 
forth, and periodically they took.  They  to
ok th em.  We didn't know where they  went.  
They  took th em about 2 or 300 miles from Lodz
.  They were experimenting.  There were 
no concen tration camps -- crematoriums.  What 
they -- when th
ey came, they put them in 
a van, in a big truck, and th e fumes were transported --      
 
Q: So gas vans.  It was gas vans
 -- murdered by gas vans.      
 
A: That's right.  Then
, when  they  came, they unloaded 
this -- some of the prisoners -- 
other prisoners stripped them.  Their things 
were stripped back in the ghetto.      
 
Q: Did you know ab out this at th
e time if you think back?      
 
A: Rumors.      
 
Q: Rumors.      
 
A: Rumors.  Because, if a woman in a shop
, she took a picture, and the picture was 
somebody whom she knew or knew about or 
what, they understood that these were 
personal things and something happened to  the people.      
 
Q: The person.      
 
A: That was in 1942.  And th
en later they were periodically
 -- they took people away, 
because people were unable to 
work.  They got emaciated.  
They died out. We had about 
hundred funerals a day.  My pa
rents died in Ghetto 2.  They
 died  hunger death.  I don't 

know if it's -- it's ve
ry hard.  Well, you can -- the wors
t you can put it.  But to imagine 
how it looked.  A normal person start to lo
se weight.  He gets thinner, thinner, and 
thinner.  Now, since most of th
e thing, what you had was a slice of bread a day, in order 
to fill the stomach, people us
ed to cook -- put 
it in the water -- and make --      
 
Q: Make it expand.      
 
A: Well, that's right.  And they started to 
swell. And you saw peop
le who are unsteady on 
his feet, sw ollen, and so forth. 
 At the end of the ghetto, I was 
also --  I was also swollen.  
I was taken to the hospital, and they took one 
liter of liquid out of my lungs.  I'm getting a 
ghetto panacea for this.      
 
Q: Who went first with 
your parents?      
 
A: Mine father.      
 
Q: Was he older than  your mo ther, or was he sicker than your mo ther?      
 
A: About four, five years older.      
 
Q: So not much older.      
 
A: Not much older.  But he went first.  My
 mother -- I remember 
when my mother told 
me -- "Remember Ami, if you ev er survive, if you surv ive, you have uncles in the States.  
Try to educate yourself.  Make something of 
yourself."  She died in 1942.      
 
Q: And your father before?  So for several --      
 
A: Before.      
 
Q: So he fairly soon after.      
 
A: That's right.  And I liv
ed by myself.      
 
Q: In the small room.      
 
A: Yeah.  You see, what they  did -- the family -- they gave
 one family per room.  They 
might be seven people, might be three people
.  Everybody got their room. We got a room 
-- small room in this building -- because we came
 early, and we were able to rent for a lot 
of money.  And so, they  left me alone over th
ere.  I mean, I was working fire department 
too.  They started to look fo r the ghetto.      
 
Q: What were you working?  Wh
at were you work ing at when  your father died?      
 
A: As a fireman.      
 
Q: You were the fire -- you were in the fire --      
 
A: Yeah.  I was a -- they called us firemans
.  We were really, you know --      
 

Q: Yeah.      
 
A: -- untrained firemans.  We were watching 
that people don't smoke cigarettes, that no 
fire starts.      
 
Q: I'm sorry to keep back at th
is, but it is an important point.
  It is sort of chronicling 
sometimes the mo st difficult experiences.  We
re you at work  wh en this happened?  Did 
you come home from work  and find he wasn't
 there?  Were you ex pecting it?      
 
A: No, my father died
 in sleep.  My mother contract
ed typhoid, and th
ey brought her 
home.  And she did not -- another tw
o weeks she died.  Well --      
 
Q: I see.  Did you have 
any other close relativ es in the ghetto
 with you or any family?      
 
A: They all died -- my whole family.  Everybod
y died.  As a matter of a fact, one -- I was 
the youngest from all 
my cousins.  After the war, when  
I tried to search for them, I found 
out that she committed  suicid
e. You know, they experime
nt with a beautiful young 
woman. At that time I was -- 1944 -- I was pr
obably 22, 25, 27 years 
old.  And she was 
all cut up.  And she didn't want to live.  Sh
e committed suicide after 
the liberation. When 
I was -- well, the ghetto was liquidated in the 19 
Lodz transport.  I tried not to go.  We 
didn't  know where we were going.  We didn
't know that we're going to Auschwitz.  
Because, if you know what Ausc
hwitz is, you have better to 
die there from the bullet than 
to board that --      
 
Q: And people knew ab out Au schwitz
 already in the camp.      
 
A: Not in the ghetto.  Not 
in th e ghetto.  The German who was omslighter[?] of the 
ghetto, Hans Biebow. He and Romkowsk i, we
re going, "we are going -- try to go to 

families.  G ermans boys were dying on the Ru
ssian front.  They want
 thank you that you 
work  for us." Anyway, people didn't believe, 
but they  didn't know what -- we felt that we 
are going to go to Arbeitslager.      
 
Q: Work camp.      
 
A: Yeah.  I remember -- I to
ld you that I saw Romkowski 
really close.  One time -- 
because whenever they gathered
 us to send us to the various
 Arbeit resort this fireman 
that was huge -- about maybe half a square mi
le place -- he called all the people together 
and Romkowski got over there on a podium.  
Not a podium, you know, whatev er table or 

this makeshift.  And said, "Children, give me
 your own parents.  
Parents, give me your 
own children.  So th e rest of us can surviv e.
"  I take that on my conscience.  I mean -- 
otherwise, if you want to give it, the Germ
ans will come and they'l
l take it.  And there 
will be a bloodshed.  Well, no, no -- we all 
go anyway.  They declar
ed spare us.  Nobody 
could leave their homes for three or four da
ys.  They went from selection, they make 
selection in each building and took people.      
 

Q: So Romk owski and his helpers.      
 
A: That's right.  All the people who couldn
't work.  Then I saw 
-- well, jumping back 
when they liquidated ghetto, I was -- 
that was 1944 in August.      
 
Q: So you were a young man 
-- 21 years old --      
 
A: That's right.      
 
Q: -- almost 21 years old.      
 
A: That's right.  I waited -- well, I was very ve
ry thin, I mean, but I 
still could walk on my 
feet. Mengele was our -- the guy who select us. 
 You went, and he "left, right, left, right," 
right you went later into Auschwitz.  Left -- 
as a matter o f fact what happened before -- 
you know, they told  us we can take it so and 
so many pounds of baggage.  So they  figure 
that probably the best thing -- if people taking
, they take the best 
thing they have it.  
When they putted [sic] us, they putted us 
like herrings -- 80, 90 pe
ople to a small cattle 
car. And one of the me n told me that he knew  
my  parents.  I said old man, he was in his 
40's.  And "would you help me
, I'm unsteady on my feet," and so  forth?  Okay.  When we 
came -- arrived in Au schwitz, there was night.  
There was sea of lig hts.  Out, out, out -- 
we all jumped.  I tried to help the man.  
And they said, "Whoever
 cannot walk -- they 
were lined up Red Cross cars.  
He can go to the Red Cross ca
rs, and he'll be transported 
there."  The men -- I tried to help him, and 
I saw a guy in a striped uniform.  I didn't 
know at that time that this wa
s the prison uniform.  We eventu
ally found out.  He grabbed 
me, "Where are you going?"  And he was 
Ru ssian.  I didn't spoke Russian, but I 
understood Russian from my  parent
s. And I try to explain to hi
m that he's  sick and this -- 
he told me, "Go there."  I still try to proceed 
him.  He grabbed me and give me a kick and 
shoved me go where other men were going.  He 
saved my  life.  Because if I'd have gone 
there, they'd  have straight to gas chambe
rs. Well, I pass the selection, and I was in 
Auschwitz for about two 
or three weeks.  I wasn't even 
tattooed at that time.  This was 
September already.  And --
 
Q: In '44.      
 
A: Yeah.  And the Russian army
 was on th e march. So they we
re preparing to  send us as 
fast as they can deep
 into Germany.  And I was caug
ht and pushed on a train and th ey 
sent us to Dachau.      
 
Q: But you didn't  know the Russian army  
was on the march at the time.      
 
A: No.      
 
Q: All you knew, you're pushed 
one place, you're pushed another place, and you're on the 
train.  And so --      
 

A: That's right.  I mean, I 
found out after the war.  When
 we came over there -- well, 
there was one time they tried to bomb us Alli
es.  Let me show you so mething.      
 
Q: Wait a minute for a second.      
 
A: You have seen this.  Well, anyway --      
 
Q: This is a photo of Birkenau exterm
ination taken by the Americans by satellite 
probably on 13th --      
 
A: Not satellite; by American bombers.  You s
ee part of the Auschwitz.  We are not in 
Auschwitz.  We are in Birkenau.  We call thatsuch.  Birkenau was Vernichtungslager.      
 
Q: Was an extermination camp.      
 
A: Yeah.  Auschwitz also a working lager, 
and th ey manufacture artificial rubber.  And 
the German needed this.  So Am
erican plane came to bomb this.
 
Q: Do you reme mb er those pl
an es, or were you already on 
the way to Dachau?      
 
A: No, I was still in Auschwitz.  We just ch
eered and the -- and the -- and the --      
 
Q: Okay.  We can pause.      
 
A: We were not afraid of bomb s, because 
we felt that you never get alive from there.  
And so -- but they just flew.  
Well, this is another thing.  
I mean, this is 
a matter of big 
controversy why they  didn't bomb -- why don't 
go into (indecipherable).  So I went to 

Dachau -- Dachau wa
s -- there w as Dachau proper 
and there were some Dachau 
subcamps around.  The Jewish prisoners were
 not transp orted to the -- to the Dachau 
itself.      
 
Q: But to subcamps?      
 
A: That's right.  And we were building the ro
ads and so forth, but we were -- a lot of 
people very often wh en our commander was h
undred, hundred, 50 pe
ople who went to 
work , you had to carry  three people who died 
because the tally in th
e evening has to, you 
know --      
 
Q: Match.      
 
A: -- agree.  That's rig h t.  I worked for 
Organisation Todt.  That was the Organisation T-
O-D-T.      
 
Q: Todt.  'T odt' means 'death' -- 
the death organization.      
 
A: No, no, no, no, no, no -- th
at's not Todt. Todt -- he wa
s man who -- the German who 
was in charge of road  build ings.  An d we were building roads.      
 

Q: So how long -- excu se me
, you were in Au schwitz for a short time then?      
 
A: Four weeks, maybe a month.      
 
Q: Relatively short time.  I mean, anything would be long.      
 
A: That's right.  But I still re
memb er the planes. And over there we were -- a lot of people 
died natu rally, but in th e middle of April, 
they trans -- I became 
very sick, and they 
transported back to Kaufering, whic
h was also a sub-camp --      
 
Q: Of -- ?      
 
A: -- of Dachau.      
 
Q: I see.      
 
A: They were supposed to fi
nish at there.  W e knew.  
Weeks.  We never believed we 
would co me out of it. We knew th at that's th
e end.  Then, whenever I arrived there, two 
days later they put us on th e 
train -- and this was maybe 25 miles from Dachau itself.  
And they  kept us on the side
lines for about -- everything was bombed.  After a few days, 
they unlo aded us.  In the mine train pr
obably out of -- I don't know how many people -- 
68, 100 -- mo st of them were dead.  Few of us
 jumped.  I was just ha
lf alive.  Then we 
were liberated.
 
Q: By -- ?      
 
A: And the Russia's history, 
you know?  Okay.      
 
Q: Do you reme mb er?  Do you rememb er
 your impressions of when  it was the 
Americans who came?  For Dachau?      
 
A: Yeah.      
 
Q: Do you remember the first 
American you saw?      
 
A: We were lame, and I couldn't  walk an
ymore. Suddenly somebody -- some people 
came up in some uniforms, said "You are free. 
 You are free."  And one
 of them started to 
wave a small American flag, and all what we started are food.  You know what are C 
rations?  C rations is what the military gets. 
 They were throwing us C rations.  I was -- I 
met over there one of th e chiefs. Not my  par
ticular this close friend, but I met him over 
there.  And he was my  neighbor.  And I open
ed my  box, smell it and started to vomit.  I 
couldn't take it.  He ate his and asked me, 
"Can you loan me yours?"  So I said, "You'll 
get sick."  "Look, we saved everything wh at 
we have it."  Flower, carrot or whatever we 
found it. You are afraid of it?  Here you are. 
 Next mo rning he was dead.  A lot of people 

-- right away the military who we
re in charge came in, an d th
ey tried to -- they chase out 
the soldier.  "Don't give to the people.  You 
kill them.  Y ou kill them
, you know?"  Okay.  

I was liberated, and I went -- I decided to go
 back to Poland to s
ee if anybody from my 
extended family -- because my  cousins few y
ears older than I, but 
they were, you know, I 
mean I knew that they were 
transported, so if anybody 
has survived --      
 
Q: So you come to that.      
 
A: You know, it's strange.  We live in a hous
e. Our neighbors live on a floor above us.  
The men was Polish officer, veterinarian Po lish army , but he had a responsible 
administrative position.  And -- but my  mo ther
 carried their daughter, and she carried me 
on th e hands.  You know, two, three years old.
  And, before we knew that, we knew that 
our ap artment is going to be taken over, because the number of people in th e 
neighborhood -- there was a nice 
neighborhood.  They  were 
requisitioned.  So my  mo m 
took the silver, everything what we had it.  And she told them, "I 
don't think so you will 
see us again -- but in  case anybody surviv es, we
'll come back."  We 
lefted [sic] them.  I 
went up there and knocked to th
e door.  And don't forget that
 the woman, I was closer to 
her than to my aunts.  I liv
ed, you know -- she opened th e do
or, got all white, and tried to 
slam the door -- said, "We don't have nothing." 
 And I just put my fo
od inside, "Look, did 
anybody ask for me?"  "No."  And I played 
with her daughter in the sand; we were 
children. I could not -- I was just walking 
down, and the girl run after me and said, 
"Eugene, I want you to tell me where are you st
aying."  I said, "Look, go in peace.  Leave 
me alone.  Best of luck."  "No, my father woul
d want to talk to you."  She never let on.  I 
told her I was staying. The men came in th
e evening and said, "Look, I don't know what 
you are thinking, but you have 
to understand what happened
.  I am a Catholic, and we 
don't divorce.  I live my  family.  My oldest
 daughter married a folk
 Deutsch -- met a folk 
Deutsch -- it was ethnic German -- and my wife 
said, "This thing will bring us luck,"  and 
gave her everything.  When  the Russian came, 
since he was an ethnic -- that's right, they 
were both shot.  But, when she saw me, she 
just froze.  Then  the men takes a gold watch 
and tell me, "That's all what I have, but I want
 to -- we live together.  You live together 
with my children as neighbors all your life 
till you were taken away.  I me an, why don't 
you have this."  And I lo ok at him, and I ta
lk to him, "Look, I mean, in Auschwitz I saw 
blood, dollars, gold, everything mixed on the fl
oor when we are dressing.  I don't need it.  
I'm not staying here."  And three days later 
I went -- at that time the Jewish emissaries 
from Palestine, or whoever want
ed to go, they were guiding 
us out of Poland, and I went 
and I came to Frankfurt am Main.  We
ll, that ends, I think, the story.
 
Q: So this --      
 
A: That's right.  Now, that 
what I told her later. This is
 probably you ha
ve thousand of 
these stories.  And I understand the purpose of it.
  But I told him that 
at that point in life 
when  we are -- you know, I am 87 today.  Wh at ha
ppened to the people after the war?      
 
Q: I want to know that.      
 

A: Well, we came here, and -- well, I met my
 -- well, no, no -- after the war, we decided 
that we are going to  continue with our education.      
 
Q: Who is "we?"  By this point 
-- because you sound like --      
 
A: Me and few friends in Salzheim, which was 
near suburb of Frankfurt am Main.      
 
Q: I need to ask a question here.  I can 
understand -- no, let me rephrase it -- I can't 
understand.  I can't imagine wh at it would be 
like to go to a family friend with whom I 
was close and have th e wife shut the door in
 my face.  I can 't imagine that.      
 
A: I don't -- I never hate against her.  She 
didn't know what to do.  I mean, her daughter 
was dead -- everything -- she panicked.      
 
Q: Okay.      
 
A: And the daughter -- well, I know the girl all 
my life.  I mean, she ran after me, and she 
wanted th at her dad would come and e
xplain to me what happened.      
 
Q: What the situation was.      
 
A: That's right.      
 
Q: But what I want to say is, "That was more 
painfu l for you to stay
 and watch -- to stay 
there than to live, at least te
mporarily, in Germany?"      
 
A: No, we didn't  want it.  We didn't want 
it.  We just wanted ou
t.  Polish -- Poland was 
quite unsymmetric. A nd we felt that --      
 
Q: There's no place.      
 
A: -- there's no future there.  I didn't know nob
ody; they were Poles. 
 I met a few of my 
classmates who survived.  Oh, 
what they told me, "Look, 
I mean, if you join , you see 
very few native Poles -- communists -- would arre
st a priest."  They
 wouldn 't.  To th e 
Jews, who today you come, and 
they were in the uniforms 
of the Polish political police 
and this -- if you joined  for a year and a ha
lf, they'll forgive you ev erything -- that your 
father own a factory.  You know, it was communist Pole.      
 
Q: That you were bourgeoisie, and so on so forth.      
 
A: That's right.  That you could go to univers
ity. I said "Good luck 
-- I'm going back ."  I 
went back.      
 
Q: So for -- if I can paraphrase -- for a variety of reasons.
 
A: Right.      
 
Q: No. 1 -- there's no family left; th
ere's nobody close.  No. 2 --      
 

A: What would I do there?      
 
Q: -- as a society, Poland is 
anti-Semitic.  No. 3 -- your choi
ces are to join the police to 
maybe arrest a priest, and that's your
 ticket to get to university.      
 
A: That's right.  That's right.      
 
Q: And what choices are those?      
 
A: That's right.  I went back.      
 
Q: I understand.      
 
A: And I learned that in Frankfurt am Main
, that was displaced 
person camp in suburb, 
maybe 20 miles Salzheim.  And there were fe
w boys whom I met who also were going to 
the same c l ass with I.  And we
 decided that we better go -- 
No -- and then we realized 
already -- it was 1946.  We realized that we  are not going -- that no country would admit 

us so soon.  And to stay ov
er in Germany, relented.  So we went and enrolled in 
university.      
 
Q: Which university is this?      
 
A: Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Univers
ität.  I call this University of Frankfurt.  What really 
happened , we went, and th ey
 were very, very forthcom
ing.  "Oh, yeah? You are 
survivors?  You don't have to pay the tuition. 
You'll get free books -- this, this.  Where is 
your abitur?"  You know what is abitur?  Ab
itur -- it is probably something --      
 
Q: Like a certificate.      
 
A: -- like in New York Board of Re
gents certificate, okay?      
 
Q: Yes, yes.      
 
A: Well, we said, "Well, if th
at 's what you wanted, you have 
to look in th
e Auschwitz for 
it." "Well, we are very sorry.  You don't ha
ve the papers.  We cannot admit you."  And 
we decided to go to  Wiesbaden, wh ich was 20 miles from Frankfurt am Main 

headquarters of American army. 
 And we got to so-called "e
ducation officer."  He was a 
man -- I think he was some associate professo
r before at University of Michigan.  You 
know Europe was very, very conservative.  
Could be 95 degrees, 
but when  you go to 
table to eat, you wear a jacket.  Here it's a guy
 with an open shirt, 
one foot on the table 
with big cigar, "What can I do fo r you, boys?"      
 
Q: [chuckling]      
 
A: And we are talking -- we are explaining to
 him. He interrupted 
us, and he said, "You 
know what it is? It's a telephone
.  All what I have to do is
 to give one phone call, and 
you'll be --      
 

Q: -- admitted.
 
A: He said, "But what are you going to  stay
 in Germany?"  I said, "No, we want to 
emigrate."  "Well, I will tell you -- I taught in
 th e United States.  As much as they will 
symp athize from you, you have to produce so
me kind of equivalenc
e certificate before 
you got admitted to university.  
So what I'll arrange for you 
-- I'll assign -- I will call the 
hesen[?].  I will call the govern
ment of hesen, the education 
ministry, and they will assign 
three people, and you'l l be screen
ing people who want to contin
ue education."  We did.  I 
was the first president of Jewish Student Asso
ciation over there. In
 1948, started with 
three or four people.  Went to almo st 100.  
But the 100, a great ma
jority of them were 
kids who came -- who parents fled with th em
 to Russia -- they cam
e back.  There were 
few programs in Poland.  An
d they continue --      
 
Q: -- West.      
 
A: That's right.  I met my wife
.  And she was in a nursing school.  We got married.      
 
Q: How long were you work ing with
 the Jewish students?      
 
A: Beg your pardon?      
 
Q: How long were you work ing 
there in Germany?      
 
A: About three years.      
 
Q: That's a long while.
 
A: That's right.  I took a numbe
r of courses.  But when I came here, the courses are called 
different.  They gave me number of credits.  
They gave me number of credits.  I -- I had 
to relearn the language.  I was going to st
udy pharmacy.  They told us that medical 
profession's very hard to breakth ro ugh for newc
omers. But wasn 't really the case.  When 
I came, they told me, 
"Look, you have a lot of credits, 
but you're in Poland. Wh en you 
finish school, you went to university.  Yo
u didn't take sociology, you didn't take 
economics and so forth.  That
's all the courses you did in 
high school. In the university, 
you were studying in your fa
culty." So  I had to  take the courses in English --      
 
Q: All this liberal arts stuff.      
 
A: That's right.  I'll sh ow you something. Beca
use, for me, it was mostly repetition.      
 
Q: It was mostly repetition?  This is --      
 
A: That's a watch.      
 
Q: That's a watch.  But this is 
the gold medal, and it is --      
 
A: You have it here engraved.      
 

Q: Okay.  Let me see what it says.  "Awa
rded to Eugene Miller of the College of 
Pharmacy of Butler Un
iversity?      
 
A: Right.
 
Q: And where is Butler University?      
 
A: Indianapolis, Indiana.      
 
Q: [to girl]  You would know what it is, ri
ght? You went to school there?      
 
A: [girl]  Y eah.      
 
A: [interviewee]  You went to Butler?      
 
A: [girl]  N o t to butler.  
Indiana University.      
 
A: [interviewee]  Oh, I finished pharmacy.
  Well, okay.  (phone ringing)      
 
Q: Okay .  So , in other word s, you didn't  listen to
 them and you went to pharmacy school.      
 
A: Yeah.  I went.  I didn't understood th e syst
em here.  I could have gone to university 
and get most of the credits.  But in Germany,
 your faculty was your state board.  They  
were employees of the government.      
 
Q: That's right.      
 
A: Not here.      
 
Q: That's right.      
 
A: So I -- so they told
 me, "You have to."  Bu
t anyway, I repeat it.  
I got my license.  And 
-- okay. And I started to wo rk, and I didn't 
care for a pharmacy here, because that's -- 

that's not even a drugstore.  You got everything 
here.  This is not aptekacia [sic].      
 
Q: That's right.  This is not apteka.      
 
A: Anyway, I decided after 40 years, I told my
 wife, "You know what 
I'll do -- it's easy to 
transfer for the second
 shift.  Everybody wants to work
 in the morning.  Maybe I can 
make a master degree."  I was -- and we were -- 
then we moved to  Ch icago.  I was at that 
time in Chicago.  We moved because my  wife's 
family lived over ther
e.  And I -- I went -
- I called University of Chicag
o, which is on quarter system, not on seme ster system.  
And I called in the middle of th e quarter; I didn'
t want to be hasty about this.  My wife 
didn't  work. We have a small house.  We ha
ve already two children.  So I call, and I 
wanted to  find out particular
s.  And a man answered.  I said, "May I speak to the 
secretary of the department?"  "Well, she's in
disposed today.  Can I help you?"  Well, I 
told him.  He said, "Why 
don't you come out here, Euge
ne?"  And I came.  He was 
talking to  me. Then he take a piece of paper, 
"Sketch your grades."  It was almost straight 

A 's.  He said, "Look."  He 
opened -- "I have here a pre-doctoral public health National 
Institute of Health scholarship.  If I offer to
 you, we'll help you financially.  Can you start 
tomorrow?"  I look at him and said, "Doctor 
Roth," I told him.  
"You don 't know much 
about me, but I have a house -- small house -- 
with a large mo rtgage.  I have a wife, 
doesn 't work now.  I have two children, and I 
have a dog.  I just 
cannot drop everything 
and live on the 600 -- or whatever 
they offer as -- to help."  An
d he said, "Well, I'll tell 
you something.  Maybe you can earn somethi
ng.  Anyway, this offer is good for three 
months to next quarter."   I came back, and 
I talked to my wife.  I talked her what 
happened.  She said, "What's th
e problem?  I'll go to work
."  She went on -- she went, 
took a streetcar, and the second day she had a j
ob.  So  I went.  And I finished.  I got my  
Ph.D . in pharmacology in medical school
, University of Chicago.      
 
Q: Wow.      
 
A: And as I was -- and I still was working an
d teaching in the lab.  And one day the Food 
and Drug Ad ministration Director of Bure
au  of Science was giving a lecture and 
chairman of my  department introduced 
me. There were very few new pharmacology 
departments.  That was in '6 0 's.  That wa
s after the Russian put th e Sputnik and Kennedy 
put money, you know --      
 
Q: Right.      
 
A: -- "Science, science, science."   And okay -- 
so I -- I g o t over ther
e, and to him for an 
interview.  And he said, "If you want a job with
 us, you have a job." And I accepted.      
 
Q: Let's see.      
 
A: This is my curriculum vitae.  I don't know.      
 
Q: I'm interested.
 
A: You -- you take th at.  I will give
 it to you. That's  a copy.      
 
Q: Okay.  And these are photographs?      
 
A: This is when I was teaching the lab --      
 
Q: And where are you?      
 
A: -- in University of Chicago.      
 
Q: Where are you in here?  That's  you behind?  
So we can't see very clearly there.      
 
A: You can see me maybe over -- this is me too.      
 
Q: Your mo ther would have been  proud.      
 
A: This -- I was campaigning fo r Jackson fo r 
president.  That's  Moynihan.      
 

Q: Yes, I can see.  I can see.      
 
A: No, these are some boys from graduate.  That
's  my wife at that 
time.  I mean, she was 
in her early 20's.      
 
Q: And this was you also as a young man.      
 
A: I gave her copies of these things.      
 
Q: Okay.      
 
A: But this they send it b
ack.  They said "return."
 
A: Other guy who inte
rviewed me.      
 
Q: So that would have been Teresa.      
 
A: Yeah, that's right.      
 
Q: And this is the continuation.      
 
A: So this is the story.  I started over ther
e; all right.  That's th
e Johann -- the Univ ersity 
of Frankfurt.  And that's Butler University. 
 And this is Ph.D. University of Chicago, 
College of Medicine, Division of Biological Sc
ience.  All right.  I started over there as -- 
well, the honors I got, I finished cum laude. 
 I was elected to Rho Chi Pharmaceutical 
Honor Society, Phi Kappa Phi National Honor 
Society of America, 
Sigma Xi Research 
Society of America, and I was a recipient of 
gold medal for (indecipherable) of science. I 
belong -- I was elected member of Society 
of Toxicolo gy.  American College of 
Toxicology. International Society of Xenobiotic
s.  All right. Xenobiotics are things wh ich 
get into our system -- like ca
dmium, lead, an d so forth -- th
is my  professional experience, 
you know.      
 
Q: And all of this is yours?      
 
A: No, no, no -- this was this.  
Then I started as a research 
pharmacologist.  I moved later 
to section chief.  I been, you 
know, you become 11, 12, 13 -- 
I'm n o t sure you are familiar 
with this.      
 
Q: Oh, yeah -- because
 we're in a federal system.      
 
A: Oh.  Then I become GS
 14.  And then.      
 
Q: GS 15.      
 
A: GS 15, I was chief of metabolism branch
.  And I directed research -- the entire 
research.  You see, we were a Freestone Fac
ility in Belsford.  That was -- we had a large 
animal facility.  We done -- that was all kind of
 research done -- cancer, heart, brain, you 
know? It was a facility  with 
the laboratories.      
 

Q: I have a question -- there was someone wh
o spoke to you this morning who -- is 
everything okay?  Is that on the right
?  You want to fix it?      
 
A: No, I want to get off.  I want 
to show you where I was.      
 
Q: Oh, you want to show me 
something.  Good.  So you sh
ow me, and then I'll ask my 
question.  It is -- there are some people who wo
uld never be able to really get past what 
they went through, and today -- I mean, 
there's a lady who we spoke to who was 
amazing, but she told us that 
every once in awhile some wave
 will come upon her --      
 
A: Oh yeah -- oh yes.      
 
Q: And so, with -- to be able 
to have such accomplishments.
 
A: No -- let me explain to you something, a
nd you understand -- that's
 very easy.  When 
you came here, we wanted not to
 forget, but we wanted not 
to think, not to have the 
nightmares.  So work, work, 
work, work.  I worked two 
shifts.  When I went to 
university, you know, I still -- th
at was my native language.  You very simply tried to do 
whatever you could -- 
I mean -- and -- and I remember 
in the school, in the pharmacy 
school, where they are saying these things "I
 was on top of my class." I mean, look -- 
people like -- there were two or three. I mean , the older people -- I was in my 20's -- what 
we are, there are finals.  A week before we
 have a big dance, a
nd they are sittin g and 
studying, you know?  It isn 't fair.  Well, but
 that, you know, you wa
nted.  You wanted to  
be busy, busy, busy.  I did things besides going
 to school.  When we came here, I was -- I 
worked in the neighb
orhood, and I -- I was th e one wh
o established -- we collected 
money, Neighborhood Tuto r Or
ganization Training Lead er 
Conference in Wisconsin. 
And what we did, we financed this, collected
 the money. I was busy.  I was busy, because 
simply you wanted to  be involved in  somethin
g, not just to be sitting.  But there was a 
many nights.  And German don't understand th
is -- or ma ybe they  do -- you wake up all 
sweated because you have a nigh
tmare.  I -- I -- the boy what 
I told you who died, I was -
- well, I -- I -- I knew him, but you know he 
was another boy in th e class.  He was the 
oldest son had a relatively you
ng father.  I remember when 
I -- when they liberated me 
after four or five days, I found a big stick, 
and I supported myself.  I said, I was looking 

for, "Maybe I'll recognize some
 face."  And her father, he called me in and said, "Did 
you?"  I said, "Yes, I was with your son in Kaufering in Da -- in the various subcamps.  

And the guy just squeezed my 
hand.  "I won't live till tomorrow.
  Tell me that my son is 
alive."  I couldn't  tell h im that his son was de
ad.  I said, "Yes, he is alive, but I'll come 
tomorrow."  Tomorrow he was dead.  I mean
, and this things -- you know, hounds you. 
Not many times, but if this -- it is
 hard to take, but life goes on.
  You see, I have two kids.  
And they know. I mean, I told
 them.  But they cannot un
derstand.  Well, they can 
understand, and they  cannot understand.  And 
my  son is a nuclear engineer.  He is in 
charge of nuclear reactor here 
behind the navy.  My daughter 
is vice president of a large 

pharmaceutical company.  And they have their 
lives.  They know fro
m -- I really wasn't 
talking to them, because I felt that they w
ould never understand how 
just frightened as a 
children.  But they k
now.  My daughter was very activ
e in the neig hbor
hood. You know 
they go.  They visit Ho
locaust Museum.  But --
 
Q: Did you have a conversation with them lik
e we have today of, you know, such -- two 
hours?      
 
A: Oh, they know.  They know
 everything.  But they -- it
's very hard for somebody 
understand to see his parents, 
and almo st yourself dying hunger 
death.  You know, this is 
worse probably than the labor -- 
than the labor in the camp.  I 
mean, it's -- no -- I still feel 
that somebody had to go 
through it.      
 
Q: Abso lutely.  We'r
e in the museum -- we're not --      
 
A: My wife had a comp letely different experi
ence. Number one, she'
s five years younger 
than I.  And she lived in -- 
on th e other side, on th e Russian occupation Dugna, Poland.  
Now it's U k raina.      
 
Q: Can you pause for a second?  So rry.  It's a gol
den ru le with us that she calls me.      
 
A: Well, she was 11 years old when  the war 
started.  And when the German -- and she 
was blond and had a green eyes
, and sh e could pass -- if yo
u know what I mean -- she 
could pass, and she co uldn't pass.  She ne
ver got -- oh, she got some money from 
Germany.  But they rejected her application.
  They  didn't understo
od this.  One time she 
said -- her parents bought birth a certificate 
of deceased Polish peasant girl.  Peasants 
don't talk with the same accent which people in
 big cities will speak wh
ole Deutsche.      
 
Q: That's true -- and chatte Deutsche.      
 
A: That's right.  So  that was fine for the 
Germans.  Blond, green ey es child --      
 
Q: She's okay.      
 
A: -- no problem.  But in the village -- there 
was mixed village -- Ukrainian and Poles.  
And, after her par -- her father escape, he wa
s in Parczew[?] with me. There were five, 
six people with guns, and they
 survive in the woods.  He liv
ed through liberation.  He 
died here.  And there were -- 
so they said that -- oh, and so, who saved her was their 
maid.  She worked for the Gen
tile maid.  She worked for th
em for 15 years.  And she 
went to her village.  But what
 -- but, when she would have 
grown up and talked to the 
neighbors, she just opened her mouth, they  
would know that she's no
t a girl -- deceased 
girl from a little Polish village.  And 
Ukrainians (indecipherable) her and 
(indecipherable) her sponsor. So, when  she wrot
e that this and this, she said "Well, how 
come she has the papers and she has to hide 
and this?"  She said, 
"To hell with you -- I 
don't want the money," and she dropped it. 
 She got some money later from Germany.  

They  give $5,000 to  every surv ivor -- that 
she got.  But for the 
indemnity -- what she 
went as a halfway -- she said she's not going 
to go into it, it will 
tear her apart.  Her 
mother was a pharmacist.  The father paid 
somebody to drive a carriage, and he was 
supposed to meet them.  She never made it. 
 Her sister was dark. 
 Her mother looked 
Jewish.  The sister was dark-eyed.  She was 
still some place on the way.  And he survived 
in the forest.  The men slept 
for two years on snow -- period.  They  stole few potatoes.  
The Poles -- the Polish farmers we
re afraid to tell Germans, b
ecause they'r e afraid that the 
people who survive will set thei
r h ouse on fire.  So later, wh
en the Russian liberated him, 
they sent him in the army.  Th
ey took one look at this ma n 
and said, "He cannot serve in 
the army."  And they sent him to Siberia to work as an accountant in a -- and that was not 

bad, she said.  He walked three miles a day to here through the snow.  
Finally he got sick.  

Some Russian soldiers brought her, and he ge
t reunited after the war with my wife.  She 
wanted to go back.  She wanted to go back. 
 When she -- wh
en the war ended, the village 
was about five or eight miles away from her to
wn in Lewino [?] , so she went.  And all 
she said that the house was bombed, her broken
 bicycle was laid.  And she started to sit 
down to cry.  So so me neighbors came and said
, "Look, there are some Jewish survivors.  
They  live here and there."  When  she went th ere -- and she didn't know her father 

survived.  She wanted to go ba
ck. Because what happened to 
the woman, she 
took her to 
a priest.  And sh e said, "I'll tell you someth
ing.  She doesn't look Jewish.  If nobody 
survives, raise her as a Catholic.  If her parent
s survive, let her go to her people."  Well, 
she never found.  She said, "I
'm going to go back."  She 
said, "No, no -- you don't go 
back.  Not only kill you, they'
ll also kill the girl who shel
tered you."  So anyway, she 
later got reunited wh en he was sick, brought ba
ck with her father a
nd her cousin.  And we 
met in Germany.  She was studying in  Munich. 
 I was studying Frankfurt am Main.  But I 
was memb er of executive board of Jewish st
udent unions in Germa
ny.  So, when I came 
over there, I met her th rough another girl. Well, 
we dated after -- we married in 1948.      
 
Q: So it's been 62 years.      
 
A: Yeah.  But that's  the story.  
And you can have a this --      
 
Q: Thank you.  I have 
one question.      
 
A: Let me just show you one more thing 
what I wanted to show you.      
 
Q: I wanted to ask you too -- 
did you ev er regret that you came back from the Russian 
border and didn't  go to your uncle in Moscow?      
 
A: Probably I would have nightmares that I --
 oh, I would have (indecipherable) cancers, 
because that's what I felt.  "I
 was the only child, and I left 
my people to die."  I don't 
know wh at would have happened .  If I woul
d have surv ived, they
 probably would have 
taken me in the Russian army.  You see -- in
 1997, we got in touch. And there was a 
number of us -- oh, I think around 60 or 
70 people, and we decided to have reunion -- 

take a cruise together.  So we went to Boca 
Raton in Florid a, and we
 for three days there, 
and then  we took a cruise.      
 
Q: How wonderful.  How wonderful.      
 
A: You can have this too.  I have a copy.      
 
Q: Thank you.  Thank you.  
Is there anything else that 
y ou would like to add to this 
interview?      
 
A: No.  No.  But you have it essen tially.  I me
an, all essentials are h ere.  I told you other 
things, I mean, but --      
 
Q: That's w h at we wanted to know.  
We wanted to know all of it.      
 
A: That's right.      
 
Q: Thank you very much, sir.  This ends
 our interview with Mr. Eugene Miller on 
September 13, 2010. Thank 
you very much.      
 
A: You're v ery welcome.           
 
Conclusion of Interview
