Sara guda( ph) Roma nia  in
 1921, Se pte mber 28t h. 
Q: Can you tell me a little bit ab
out your childhood an
d your family life
 before the war? 
A: My mother came from
 Prague, Czechosl ovaki a an
d her par ents l i ved i n Pr
ague.  My fat her  came  
fr om Czer nowitz , whi c h wa s about  
10 miles from where we lived an
d his par ent s li ved t her e.  I  
we nt ver y fr equentl y wit h my mo

ent  every summer i n  
one of the ni ce spas i n 
Czechosl ovaki a, li ke Fr an
censbat( ph) , Car delsbat( p
h), Mari nebat(ph) .  And 
so I was very cl ose 
to my mother's... 
Q: What do you re me mb
er a bout your chil dhood, what 
disti nct  me mor i es
 do you have? 
A: My most disti nct me mori
es are t hat  I was much closer to my 
fat her than t o my mother .  He was a 
very well-e d ucate d ma n who wa s ver y
 int eres ted i n e duc ation and si n
ce I  wa s a n onl y child, he ga ve 
me a lot of attention in this area.  He had return
ed from the fir st World Wa
r with a shrapnel in hi s 
hip whic h wa s not  pr operly re moved, s o he was 
not  well, he  di dn't walk easil y a nd was ver y  
sede ntar y a n d hi s great es t joy was  
to teac h me .  Ge ogr aphy, history,
 la nguages.  Thi s  is how he  
instilled in me a great 
love for education. 
Q: Di d you c o me fro
m a religious home? 
A: No.  I ha ve no re colle c tion, ot hers t hat, ma ybe 
once a year , it 's a hi gh hol y da ys, my parent s went  
to t he synagogue.  Bu
t ot her t ha n t hat , no. 
Q: Di d you i denti fy as  a J e
wi sh per son or  Je wi sh gi rl? 
A: No t at all .  It was , I d on 't k n
ow how to explain it, bu
t it was just not very im
portant.  
Although I 
do r e me mbe r  that my pa rents cont
ributed to, to Zionis m.  We  had 
in our house a certain, I don't 
know how you c all it , pi ggy bank, where we al wa ys pu
t money in and this was 
with, in the shape of, 
I don't know i f it  was  apart, but
 it was wh ite and blue.  And we  
al wa ys put mone y i n  ther e a nd I

have no idea where t hat mo
ne y we nt but it was e x plained t o me as 
a child that this is
 for , for Je wi s h  
people  who nee ded it. 
 That's all I know. 
Q: I gue ss  I assume  t hat  your 
friendships were very mi xed?  
A: Ve ry mi xed, our nei ghbors  le ft
 a nd ri ght  wer e not Je ws, but t h
ere  we re als o q uite  a fe w Je ws  
a mong the m.  It was , unti l 1937, I wa s  not at all a w
are.  I shoul dn't say that
 beca use I do re me mber  
now t hat on Me mori al Day, whic h 
is a holi day for  ever ywhere in 
the  worl d and schoolchildren went  
to the cemetery but the Je
wi sh s chool childr en wer e sepa rate d from 
the othe rs and went t o the J e wish 
cemeter y.  That is when 
I  became aware that , that t here was a 
difference bet ween the other chil dren 
and  me .  T ha t 's all I  re me mb er.  
Q: But not hing t hat  ma de you fee l  terribl y di ffe r
ent?   Wer e  you, were 
you ever aware of anti-

Se mitism, early in... 

A: Yes, yes, at that ti me I  beca
me  aware of anti-Se mitism and par
ticul arly i n  1937, t her e wer e ti mes  
where i n our  town, soldi ers, Roma
ni an s oldi ers a nd partic ular ly Roma nia n  office rs, who pr oba bl y 
often got drunk, were roam
ing the streets with guns
, with the revolvers in their hands and yellin g 
lou d wo rds  a gain st Je ws .  Yes , I  was , t hat wa
s whe n I  be ga n t o be ver y muc h a fr aid.   
Q: Did, did that a
ttitude affect the, your Chri
stian friends?  I mean, did 
they pick up the spirit o f  
that? 

A: No, not partic ularl y, as a ma
t ter of fact, I remember one in
cident where thi s one Romania n  
officer was running throu
gh the streets and ye
lling, "I'm going to
 kill all the Jews."  A couple of 
friends of my father's, my stepfa
t her , this was i n 1937,'38, a c oup
le of friends who were not Jews, 
tried to approach this officer and 
to talk reason to him and they 
were , I ha d comple
tely the feeling 
that they we re on our si
de, t hat t he y wer e not a ga i nst us and 
t hey were t w o of the  lea d ing pe ople  i n  
town.  So I didn't have a 
compl ete fe eling of being betr ayed by
 every Chri stian, 
you know.  But , I  
can't describe it too well, 
this is how it  be ga n. 
Q: And then at what poi
nt  di d it  ge t worse?  
A: We ll we heard then the speeches
 that Hitler gave on th
e radio and we kept th
inking, well it's not 
goi ng to last  too long, because sane peopl e woul d not
 accept this and all, and anyway it 's not here,

it 's s o me whe r e in Ger ma ny a nd t h
en it was in Austria and then it 
was i n Cze chosl ova kia, but and 
then it was in Poland, and Poland wa
s pretty close to
 where we lived, 
but we still coul
dn't believe it, 
we still didn't think that it would fi
nd us.  I can't, when I think of 
this now, I just
 can't understan d 
how my par ents di
d not  accept my uncl e 's
 offer  to leave.  
They, they si mpl y di dn't think that 
anyt hing could ha ppen t o t he m. 
 And we saw a numb er of Jews 
fr om Po land coming to our town  
and we made room where 
we lived fo r them to sleep and we 
saw how it happened, but we still didn't 
believe it.  And then in 
1940, when Hitler an
d Stalin made this pact, we
 had not very much of a 
choi ce.  We  thought, si nc e we kne w
 what happened under Hi t ler to pe
ople, that we would in fa ct be  
better off to stay where we a r e a nd very ma ny pe opl
e were gl ad that the S
oviet s ca me .  Of c our se ,  
we  di dn't know what woul
d ha ppen.  It was  ha rd. 
Q: Can you tell me a little b
it about life  under the Sovi
ets?  I know that you've
 told me  before that 
your home  wa s ta ke n 
away fr om you. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Whatel se? 

A: The interesting part was that 
their propaganda was so
 eff icient , they, ther
e were c onc erts , the 
people danced in the str eets.  Th
ere wer e speeches that there is no 
bett er qualit y of li
fe than in the 
Soviet Union.  The chi ldren got t h
eir education for fr ee.  The older 
people got their medical help for 
fre e .  Pe opl e  wer e  ta ken care of fr
om their birth t o thei r da y t hey 
die d.  They ne ver ha d to worry. 
And all of this wonderfu
l t hing happened because
 the Communist governme
nt  kne w how to ta ke  
care of it 's peopl e.  And in the 
mea nt i me , duri ng t he ni ght, pe ople di
sappeared.  An d 
this, this was 
very, ve ry di ffi cult , bec a use it hit us al most i
mmediatel y a nd then one of
 t he Sovi ets , who move d 
into our house, told me, fi
rst of all he said to me
, "You know that 
t here  is  no God."
  And you know 
this, for me , eve n though I wa s not br
ought up i n  a strict rel i gi ous 
sense, it was awful thing for me 
to hear .  And then when
 my fat her wa s take n awa y, thi s  ma
n, whose na me I do not know, I don't  
think I even knew it then, this ma
n sa id to me , "Look, you a r e  a 
young per son, you have the bes t  
chance for a wonder ful li fe i n our c
ountry, but you have to
 put an ad i n the pa
per that you wa nt to 
have not hing to do wit h your fat her
, who is an ene my of the pe ople ." 
 And of cour se I didn't do it.

Thi s is how life was under the Sovi
et s.  We saw a big poster, said, 
was seen in many
 pl aces.  Stalin 
wa s hol ding on hi s lap a c hild a nd gi vi ng the chil d a wris twatc h , bec aus e tha t  child had i n for me d the  
teacher that t he parents at  home 
had spoken against the 
gover n ment.  An
d what the par ents had sai d  
wa s, " N o eggs toda y for  brea kfas
t ."  And the fat her had s aid, " A
gain no eggs?"  An d this was 
regar ded a s counter-r evolutionar y tal k.  The par e
nts were arr ested a nd t h e child got a  watc h.  The 
pare nts  dis appeare d.  Th
at was how life was. 
Q: Did, we r e Jewish bus i ness es ta ke n away, we r e pe
ople all o we d to go to school, did sort of e very 
day li fe  c hange?  

A: People went to s chool  and Je wi sh busi nes ses 
were taken a w ay, all businesse s were t ake n a way  
but the difference wa
s that the Christians who 
had businesses could, under 
the pack that Hitler and 
Stali n ha d, c oul d say that  they are fals e Ger ma ns , 
whi ch means that their ancest ors wer e of Ger man  

bac kgr ound and t her e for e the y were not a rrest ed.  
They had t he ri ght t o be resett led i n to Ger ma ny  
and whil e the Soviets took away the i r  hous es in Satta
gura( ph) or in one of 
thos e towns, whe n the y  
wer e resettl e d, the y got a n, an e qui val ent house or apart me nt in Ger ma ny.  And I eve n know a bout  

one  man who was  ta ken the s a me night as  my fat h
er, who was a Chris tian a nd who was a merc ha nt,  
a busi nes s m an.  He, he dealt with, he sold ha m 
and, and kie l basa a nd ha d pigs and ma de the m,  
ma de , made these foods at home a nd then s old t h
e m.  Well he wa s rega rded a Capit ali st.  He was  
take n the sa me night, but he said t hat  he wa s a 
fal se Deuts chner(ph), he was not , he was actually a  
hal f Polis h, hal f- Ukraini an Christi an.  Well he was 
take n out  of the pris on and s ent t o Ger ma n y. 
And he  es ca ped, my father di dn't . 

Q: Just for t h e clar i ficati o n here, 
we 're talking about your stepfather? 
A: Yes, yes. 

Q: Was ther e fear on the streets,
 was it better or worse than the 
Roma nia ns who were hunting dow n  
people?  

A: Ye s a nd no.  A ver y di ffic ult 
t hing to answer .  The 
people wh o were not a
rrest ed and who wer e  
friendly towards the Soviet Union, 
di dn't feel that  they ha d a n ythi ng 
to fear.  They thought that it 
would be jus t  the very ri ch pe opl
e who, who should be tre ate d that way, beca use t hey, they re ally

shouldn't be so rich.  
But  ver y s l owl y , it bec a me 
clear t o ever ybody that 
you couldn't talk.  Ev en 
though they said you ha
d free dom to say anythi ng, you kne w  
t hat you coul dn't, you couldn't  even 
think against them.  
Q: No w yo u wer e  a bo ut 1 9
 years old, wh at we re 
you doing at  t he ti me?  
A: I had just fi nished the conservator y . 
 It wa s, I be lieve  
it wa s June 12, 1940. 
Q: The conservat ory where? 

A: I n Czer n owi tz.  Whi c h was  the l a rger t o wn .  
It 's some  10 or 15 mi le
s a way.  And t wo we eks 
later, J une  28, is whe n t h
e Soviets  oc c upie d our  town. 
Q: And you were back 
home i n Sat t a gura( ph)?  
A: Yes , yea h . 

Q: Tell me just a little bi
t about Czernowitz be
cause it seems like 
you spent quite a bi
t of time there. 
A: Czernowi t z was a wonder ful town. 
 It was, I beli eve t here were 
about  100,000 pe ople a nd a  gr eat  
majority of them were Je ws.  Very well educated
, very motivated towards 
education a n d ver y pr oud  
to, to read a great deal and to 
be considered intellect
uals.  Czernowitz was 
considered the little 
Vienna, whereas Bucharest, as the 
capital of Romania, was 
considered little Paris. 
 In Bucharest, t h e 
second l anguage was Fr ench, fir st 
was Roma nia n.  I n Czer nowi tz, 
the fi rst language was German, 
beca use it ha d bel onged t o Austri
a, to the Aust ro- H ungaria n monarc
hy, wher e most e duc a t ed pe opl e  
spoke German. 

Q: It wa s a  g ood  
li fe  t her e, huh?  
A: Ye s, I t hi nk it  was .  The pare nts a nd gra ndpar en
ts ke pt tal king a bout t he good old ti me  of Kais er 
Fra nciose ph( ph) .  They l ove d that Kaiser .  And t h
ey wer e ve ry ass i milate d.  The y, i n  fa ct, didn't  
belie ve t hat anyt hing c o uld ha ppe n t o the m beca us
e they, in the first Wo rl
d War they served as  
Austria ns , they got medal s and a wa r
ds  and they we re proud of t hat, 
t hey, the y just c oul dn't belie ve  
that this could happe
n.  They also couldn't be
lieve that a civilized nati
on like Ger man
y could do an y 
har m t o pe ople.  It  wa s st range. 

Q: Do you re me mber  the Ger ma n  oc c upati on?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0436

A: Thi s ha ppene d one ye a r  aft er 
the Soviets had occ upie d us.  The 
Soviet s ha d done a ver y thoroug h  
job t o deport  a gre at ma ny pe opl e, pa rticularl y 
t hi nki ng people , pa rticul arly.  The de por tation took  
place on June 12, 13 and 
14 I belie ve , 1941.  This ... 
Q: This  was  an i nvolunta ry deportati o n?  

A: Yes.  And it's interesting th
at we had, when we came to 
the Unite d States many, ma ny years  
later, s o me where , we ha d found in a , an ol d issue 
o f the Ne w Yo rk Ti mes ,  th
at a very small article 
that said that people of the Bu
chavina(ph) had asked Comrade Stal
in, had requested to be resettled 
into the interior of Soviet Russia, 
for fear of t he Nazis.  And that 
Comr ade Stali n had agreed to it . 
And thi s wa s the de porta tions t hat ha ppe ne d in th
e mi ddl e of  the ni ght a ga i nst, nobody wa s asked, 
nobody as ke d t o be r esett led. 

Q: So when t he Ger mans came 
in, wh at was happenin
g?   Wer e you, you wer e in Satta gur a(ph)?  
A: No.  When the German
s ca me  in I wa s 
alr eady mar ried to Sam and 
I wa s in hi s apart me nt. 
Q: Okay then let's, let 
me bac ktra ck a bit here .  You have ex
plained as well as 
Sa m has explai ne d  
how you got  mar r ied. 

A: Yes , yea h . 

Q: Di dn't  rea lly know e ac h other .  

A: Yeah. 

Q: You knew of him?  

A: Yeah, yea h. 

Q: Di d he  know you?  

A: I don't  thi nk so, but  I 
don't know, I don't  know. 
Q: Beca use  you had st udie
d at t he conser vat ory? 
A: Yes, yes, yes. 

Q: It 's, do you ha ve a ny re me mbra nce of what 
wa s goi ng t hrough your  mi nd?   You went t here t o 

fi nd wor k, you went  to
 the c ons erva tory t o 
fi nd wo rk and you im
me diat ely got  marrie d. 
A: Yes .  Yes , I do hav e  me mo ry o f
 that.  My, first of all, I was te
rribl y a fr aid be cause I had le ft my 
home , my mother  had sai d
 run.   And she  had given me  a br own bag wit h  some  bl ack brea d a nd I  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0436

belie ve it wa s lard.  And also s he ha
d told me to put on 
t wo dr esse s, one on top of t he other bec aus e 
I coul d not c arry a nyt hing.  I ha ve
 to run a nd nobody sh
oul d know that I 'm r unn
ing.  So I put on a  
summer  dr ess and over it a wint er dr
ess and made my  wa y to Czernowitz. 
Q: Why we r e you runni ng t here?  
A: Because the, this was the Sovi
ets.  Because t h e, a neighbor 
ha d said, who was fri endl y wit h a 
Soviet soldier, that he had told 
her that this night they are going 
to come for the whole  fa mil y, a fter  
they ha d taken my father  awa y. 
 And so my mo ther had said, r
un a nd go to Czer nowi tz and sta y  
with this fa mily, tryi ng to re me mber their na me , Is
inger(ph), Isinger(ph).  We ll,
 it wasn't  easy.  First 
of all the fear.  When you are 
under  curfe w, the r e were e ver ywhe
re soldiers and when they saw 
some body movi ng they s t op
ped hi m and wa nte d to know wher
e are you goi ng.  Well , I kne w t h e  
area ve ry we ll, I mana ge d some how 
t o make it t o the ne xt town.  
All ni ght it took me .  And whe n I  
came there, the Isi ngers( ph) t old
 me  they c oul d not put me up b
ecause t here was a raid in t his  
apart me nt  hous e a nd a number  of pe ople , whol e fa mi lies ,
 were taken away.  At  
that time th
ey di dn't  
know where  to.  We know
 now it was to Siberi
a.  And so I had nowhe
re to go but to the 
Phil har moni c, whic h al s o hous ed the Cons ervat ory 
of Musi c, whic h al so ho
used a movie t heat e r, 
whi c h was c a lled Keynot e Cent ral.  Whe n I ca me 
there, I was dead tired, 
because I ' d wal ked al l  
night a nd I  kne w t he building very 
well .  I  went up int o thi s pr
ojection room, fr om the mo vie ,  
knowi ng that  nobody would be 
t here at  that ti me and I feel asleep
 o the floor.  An
d I thought when I  
wake up in the morning, th
e  only thi ng I  c oul d do, was t o tr y to
 see i f I  could find a job i n t he 
conservator y , beca use I  had j ust gra d uate d, you know
.  So when I woke up 
it was not morning, it 
wa s clos er to 12 noon.  I had sle pt se veral hour s a nd whe n I ca me to t he office of the conser vat ory, 

this ma n was  just cl osi ng 
the office .  It  was 12 and 
in Europe be twe en 12 a n d one is l unc h hour a nd 
I said, "Coul d I come i n for a mo me
nt , I 'm looki ng for a  jo
b."  And he l ooked at me a nd he s aid, " A  
job?  At 12 o'clock noon? 
 This is time for lunch,
 not fo r a job."  You know
, he  was very fli p a nd I 
wa s not i n t he mood for , for t his 
type of conversation, so I said, 
" N o, no, I wa nt a job."  He s aid, 
" What , what  job? "  I s aid, " Well , I 've , here 's my 
paper, I have graduated fr
om the conservatory and I 
am a pianist."  He said, "Well,
 now look, how much 
mone y do you ha ve? "  And I  said, " Thre e

ruble s," s o mething like 75 cent s.  And he sai d, " T ha
t 's enough."  And I said, " What? "  I thought for  
lunc h.  " No," he sai d, "It ' s enough to get marrie d."
  And I said, "No, no, pl ea
se don't joke with me, 
my mind is not on that."
  He said, "Well I am no
t going to open this office 
door until I come back at  
one , but i f you want t o, you c a n c o
me wit h me."  And I trai led a f
ter hi m and I thought we wer e  
goi ng to e at somet hing a nd we went i nto s o me bui l din
g.  See, i n the , at that ti me , every buildi ng was  
di ffere nt fr o m wh at we wer e  us ed to .  So we wen t  
up one or t wo fl ights of stai
rs .  [End of Si de 1 of 
Tape 1].  So we went up ther
e and a young woma
n, around 17, asked, sitti
ng behind a desk, asked,  
"Do you wa nt to get ma rried?"  An
d he  sai d, " Y es."   And she as ke
d hi m, "Do you li ve with thi s  
wo ma n?"  He said, "No."  "Do yo
u live with another woma n?"  "N
o."  "Do you have children?" 
"No."   " Y ou have c hildr e n wit h t h
is woman?"  "No."  "D
o you have children wi
t h a not her woma n? "  
"No."  Then she asked me 
t he sa me  que stions a nd t o me a l l  of 
this was an insult
, because I never 
eve n had a date.  And when this proc e dure was 
fi nishe d, s he ca lled over a ma n who wa s swe e pi ng  
the floor, whos e na me I  don't know to this day 
a nd he wa s the wit ne ss wh
o signe d and we got a 
piece  of pa per and we went downst
airs and as we we nt downstairs, 
nat urall y we s poke Ger ma n .  He  
aske d me , in the  very for mal  Ger ma
n, ______  " B y t he way, what i s 
your na me? "   And this a fter  we  
got ma rrie d.  And so we we
nt back to the conser vatory, he enr o
lled me as a pianis
t accompanist and 
gave me right away work to
 do in a certai n room with a choir , 
and tol d me at five o'cl ock we me et  
in fr ont of t h e building and we go home .  And no 
more r unning around.  He never a ske d about my 
bac kgr ound, he ne ver as ked me what happe ned a n d he
 tol d me he ha d a mot her
 and a sist er at home, 
whi ch I di dn't believe, but  I had no choice, I ha d nowh

stepfather away and my mother
 went ever y day wit h food t o  
a certai n pl ace where many women 
stood in line, their husba n ds ha d 
bee n take n the sa me wa y.  Or ma yb
e their sons, or brot hers .  And I  
think ther e wer e  mostl y me n that t he y had t a ke n at
 that ti me .  And the n one da y, my mother c a me , 
maybe she had al rea
dy been six weeks, every day and one da
y there  was another  guar d and he  sai d, 
"He 's  not her e, he  ne ver  wa s here ."  You know t h at. 
Q: Ye ah.  Le t me as k you so
mething, this is just sort of an inte
resting point, I mean
 if the men were 
take n a way fir st, t his , di dn't th
is put the women of th
ese towns in a complete
l y di fferent rol e an d 
situation now?  
I mean in term
s of their resp
onsibility and... 
A: Sure , sur e, cause the y had t o do ever ythi ng, th
ey had to fend for the ms elve s.  But that di dn't  
ma ke them more assertive, they were very cour ag
eous, but women were not 
very assertive to begin 
wit h.   So  it wa s j ust 
a matter of survival.  
Q: Di d you s ee a  c hange  i n
 your mother a ft er your
 father was taken away? 
A: No, no.  And,
 and even when 
my mother  survi ved 17 years of 
Siberia a nd e ve n a ft er  I found her  
agai n and she came t o us her e i n 
the Uni ted States, when I t ri ed t o
 disc uss  wit h her  what happened 
there , she ne ver want ed t o talk a b
out it.  And she said to me, when
ever I asked to tell me about it, 
she s aid, " N o.  No, no."  
And t hen I said, but, one da y I got ve
ry a ngr y a n d I sai d, " T hey took your  

hus ba nd a wa y and the y ki lled hi m a nd you don't e v en 
know where he 's buri ed and you don't want to  

talk about it?"  And she an
swered very quietly, "He was an enem
y of t he pe ople ."  And t his was t h e  
ma n s he loved and belie ved i n.  So t hey had done a ve
r y good job on her .   I fi nally got  her to t ell me  
that she would, she had promised that mai n chi e f t here 
never to talk about this event.  He had said to  

her, "If you ever want to
 see your children again, 
you will forget all that y
ou lived here, all that you  
sa w here ."  And she ne ver wa nte d to talk about a n d 
to this day I do not know. 
 Except here and there  
a little bit.  She told me about th
is guard who had a chil
d.  I think it was probab
ly only one child, 
one little boy and when he 
knew that she knew languages, partic
ularly French, he
 wanted her to 
speak French to him and he gave 
her a  gla ss of milk a da y.  An
d she , her li vi ng quarter s wer e  
slightly i mpr ove d, she s h ared 
a room with a lady 
from Cze r nowitz  whose  hus ba nd was  als o ta ken 
away, but he was taken b
ecause he was a leadi ng Zionist and hi
s name was Wei sel ber g er(ph), ver y

well known.  I think he wa
s a lawyer, I 'm not sure.  
So with this Mrs. We isel
berger(ph) she shared a 
room in Si beria and then when 
Kru s c h ev  ca me  t o  po wer  a n d  s o me
how permitted people over 65, i f 
they had relatives in Israel... 
Q: You actually 
told me  this. 
A: Yes , to, to come out , so Mr
s. Weiselberger (ph) came out a
nd br ought along a lette r fr om my  
mother  t o he r br other i n South Ameri ca. 

Q: And you were able to? 

A: Yes, that's how we ... 

Q: Some of these areas t hat we'v
e re corded, I 'm goi ng to s ki p ove r bec a use in t he interest of ti me  
and your energy. 

A: Yeah, yea h, absol utel y . 

Q: So, you were married. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Did t hat, I realize ma ny, ma ny 
ye ars later that  it was a good marria ge, but in t he be ginning wa s  
that terribly awkwar
d for  you or  not?  
A: I ca n 't say  ho w it was , I was co
mpl etely dea d inside .  You know, 
it was often an ir
ony to me , that  
when the Germans took us into the 
conce ntrati on c a mp a yea r later, the Soviets ha d done suc h a job 
on me that I wa s not able  to be mo
re shocke d, more afr aid.  They ha
d alre ady kil l ed me, insi de .  It  
wa s unbelie vable .  To me, you know, t he word Siberia,
 as you ma y know in all of Sovi et  or Rus sian 
literature, usually meant that peopl
e never returned from there. So, 
I don't know what else to tell 
you. 

Q: When you say that the Soviet
s ha d alrea dy de stroyed you, you'r
e tal ki ng about by taking a way 
your pare nts ? 

A: Yes, yes. 

Q: Not any personal brutality? 

A: No, no.  Just by
, and you know, it  was so str a nge t o thi nk, 
why do the y ha ve to r e sort to suc h 
terror?  If life is so complete th
at eac h pers on is t ake n ca re of fr om
 t he da y of t heir  bi rt h to the day

of their deat h, why do they ha ve 
t o, t o terrorize peopl e by t aki ng the m a wa y?   If the y wa nt to ta ke  
away a house, why mu
st  they se nd t his pers on t o Si beri a?   If
 they want to take
 away somebody's  
fl our millor somebody
's business, why must this
 person be destroyed?  
You know, almost all these 
people woul d ha ve bee n per fe ctly sati sfi ed to bec o
me  e mpl oye es of the , of
 the government in their 
former own place of work.  But, as
 I think back, I know 
t hat  the r eason must 
be that they had to  
destr oy the mi ddle cl ass and 
that 's what they di d. 
Q: What happened when the 
Germans came  in?  You were 
in Czernowitz at the ti me? 
A: Yes.  When the Ger m ans came i
n, it happened very fast, so fa st 
tha t  the Soviets coul d bare ly r un 
as fa st as the Germans followed them.  Our town wa
s by t hat  t i me already, 
they ha d undergone  the , 
the Soviet terror of a large group of them bein
g de porte d and nobo
dy kne w where to.  Only now do  
we know where to.  An d, of course
 the coming of the Ge
r mans meant that they 
will first of all go  
after the Jew that were still there 
and so mo st of the Jews
 tried desper atel y t o  run wit h t he  Sovi ets. 
Q: You and Sa m,  wh at were you doing? 

A: We were, we, we knew that if
 we stayed, the Germans will kill 
us, but we also 
knew that there 
was no way of running with
 the Soviets.  And, but 
still, we went down to th
e bridge and there were 
guar ds , but you c oul dn't get thr ou
gh t h e bri dge  to go ea st, bec ause 
these guar ds wer e
 ther e to make 
sure that first of all, all the Sovi
et Rus sians shoul d get over the brid
ge.  So t hey didn't let  us thr ough  
and we, a nd we we nt home  a nd we s aid i f  we ha ve
 to die, we'll die in our own bed.  A friend of 
ours , who is  a, an opera  singer
, hi s na me i s Pa ul Marc o(ph) ,  
he ha d c o me  from Buchare st t o 
Czernowitz when t he Soviets came 
i n, because i n  Buchar est , under 
the Romanians wh
o were allied 
wit h the  Na zis, he had no futur e at
 all.  We ll, he was ab
le t o get over t he br
idge, together with a 
group of Russian si nge rs .  
And his  st ory i s unbeli eva ble.  He  kne
w, t he more he got
 into the Soviet 
Uni on, the  more he  want e d t o get out  of the r e 
and c oul dn't, coul dn't.  
Anyway, we we nt home.  
Q: Were  ther e bombi ngs?   Ho
w di d t h e Ger ma ns  c o me i n ?  
A: We he ard bombings, we
 hear d the  nois es of war, but we st ay
e d in our apart me nt a n d one or t w o  
days later, I think was that they
 came  in and took a
ll the me n out , I thi nk Sa m ma y ha ve tol d you  
about this and took them to what
 t he Sovi ets call the _____, the Pa
lace of Culture and there, I

belie ve t hat , I was sure  that I 'll  ne ver  s ee Sa m a gai
n, but  he  ha s  told you tha t
, that he ma naged t o ge t  
away from t here. 
Q: Well, you've told me  as well. 

A: Yes .  See  I don't think
...  They use d Sa m t o di g 
graves for , I  don't know 
how they did it, to c ount  
one , t wo, thr ee and e very third pers on, I don't 
re me mber e xa ctl y, but s o
me how he found his wa y  
out . 

Q: So a t  wha t  point  di d you ha ve  to
 le ave  your  house,
 what  happened? 
A: You know,  I don't 
know, I don't ex
actl y know when it happened. 
Q: Well wait, let me, do we have 
a sense of whether it wa
s a fe w wee ks late r, a 
couple mont hs later ,  
a fe w da ys?  

A: It wa s,  I t hin k a  
fe w weeks  or  mont hs l ater , not  i m me diat ely. 
Q: What  ha ppe ne d in t hese  fe w 
weeks  or t he s e fe w mont hs, we
re , woul d you go about your  
business, could you go 
out on the streets? 
A: No .  We wer e  per mit t e d o ne h
our a day t o go out a nd t o get so
me wat e r fr o m a we ll, whic h wa s  
about a hal f a bl oc k a wa y fr om wher e we l i ve d

sort of in hiding, but we r eally di
dn't have wher e to hide
, we we re in our a pa r t me nt .  I think thi s wa s  
a fe w wee ks or mont hs  
and t hen ca
me  the. ..  
Q: So the me n didn'
t go out on the 
str e et at  all? 
A: Ri gh t.  

Q: So basi ca lly li fe s t opped and you wer e... 

A: Yes, yes, yes.  And then we
 ha d to go to th

Q: One day, there was, there wer e si
gns al l over , poster s, t hat  said 
all the Jews must
 go, fi nd a place  
to live in the ghettos, it's the gh
etto was really the collection point
 for t h e fut ure deportati ons to

Q: How l ong di d you li ve in

A: That 's ver y di ffi c ult .  Not lo

.  Ther e was a, tr ying 
to re me mb e r , the r e was  
a ma yor of Cze r nowitz, who was a 
very dec ent guy.  His na me wa
s Tr yon( ph) Popo
vitch( ph).  I  
think he  di d all he could to hel p 
the Jews.  I think if he were aliv
e, he would be calle d a righteous  
gentil e.  He did help a, a number
 of J ews.  He ha d the ri ght of re
questi ng, for, for wor k, a certai n, a  
fe w t housa nd suc h pa per s, you know, to, to sa y thi s
 Jew is absolutely necess
ary for our work a nd in  
this way he  s ave d a bout, I 'd sa y, 20,0
00 Jews.  Only te
mpor aril y.  And... 
Q: I 'm curious what  your  dail
y l i fe wa s like i n t his  ghett o,
 c oul d you go i n a n d out?  
A: No, no. 
Q: Was ther e food, was t here... 

A: You know, I do not r ecall anyt hing
 about thi s.  I, I recall l ess abou
t this even than
 duri ng, tha n  
later on i n t he ca mp.  We , I ha ve no i dea how we 
were , I know we, we didn't 
go out.  I know we  
were absolutely paralyzed with fe ar, because we
 didn't know fr om mo me nt to mo me nt wh at wa s 
goi ng to ha ppen to us. 

Q: What did you e at?  

A: I don't know.  As I say, we we
re in this apartment 
that belonged to my 
friend.  I i magine that  
there ma y have be en s o me food bec ause t hat wa s 
a di ffere nt proposi tion th
an later on in the camp, 
but I can't explain how we 
did it and wh at we  did. 
Q: Were , we re Ger ma n guards pres ent, wer e Romania n guar ds  pre sent?  

A: Roma nia n, Roma nia n  guards.  

Q: So they were actually doi
ng the work for t he Germans?  
A: Yes, yes. 

Q: And  wh at  were  the y l i ke?  

A: We  were afraid of them.  

Q: Wh y?  

A: Because t hey were the au
t hori t y and we  were  a fraid 
of any kind of authority. 
Q: Di d the y abuse pe ople , wer e t hey nasty?

A: I don't ha ve a re coll ec tion of th

 Ro manians, I don't know
, it, it, see, I don't 
wa nt t o sa y somet hing t h at I 'm 
not  sure about .  The Ro
ma nians were often he
lpful whe n you could 
bribe them.  They were not as vicious perhaps as, 
let 's  sa y, t he ,  the Lit hua ni ans for i nsta nce , or  the  
Ukraini ans, they were terrible so
meti me s.  Th e R o mani an
s you could, onc e in a w hile t hey coul d  
help you.  It 's very di fficult t o r ecall  all of 
thi s after you've tried 
so hard to forget i t. 
Q: Now did you know a n ythi ng 
at this point 
about  camps?  
A: No. 
Q: In Pola nd or  anywhere ? 

A: No, no.  We  knew nothi
ng a nd we  kne w t hat  one da y, some 
day, we  woul d be de ported, but we  
thought that it would simply be a 
wor k ca mp, whe r e people ha ve to wor k.  After all , the r e was a wa r

right?  

A: I gue ss  so.  

Q: And did you ha ve a n y, 
did you know a nyt hing ab
out de portations, di d you
 thi nk you would hav e  
to leave at some poin

A: Yes.  We had hear d that there 
were  people in M orgal ev( ph) , this 
here and that pr
obably when our 
turn comes, we will go in the same
 route, you know.  And then on

we we nt.  And we were 
put into catt l e cars a nd I do not rec all  
how long the trip was , s everal da ys,

Q: Do you, did t hey ta ke the whol

for instance this girlfr iend of mine
, in whos e apart me nt we live d, I d

at that time .   I know she 
did go, but not at that time. 
Q: So ma ybe they came  for you... 
A: Later, yes. 

Q: ...first because you we
re the intellectuals, or... 
A: Yes , pr obably, pr obably
 that 's what it was.  Because our en

stone qua rry wer e t he i nte llectua ls. 

Q: Do you re me mber  the mood or
 how you felt on t his train?  
A: Terri ble .  Unbel ievabl e, unbelie va ble.  First of
 all there was so many 
peopl e that you c ould not

what expected us, we 
didn't know what t o e xpe ct.  And

A: Yeah. 

Q: ...for a  s h ort ti me?  

A: Yeah.  I  would s ay mayb

Q: And they, you di dn't work, 
you re al ly didn't  do a nyt hing?  
A: No. 

Q: How did you get out  of the r

on what woul d happe n next ? 
A: No, we had no thoughts, but one day the y ca me a
nd made the roll call and at that roll call they set  
aside a man who was a glazier , a ma

was a, I don't know, buil der, 
a doct or who was a s urge on and the y called Profes so
r Sa muel Flor a nd he didn't move , beca use t he y  
separ ate d the people tha t , thes e fe w people , the bui

with the surgeon 
and wit h the fe w peo ple wh o were

uni for me d ma n sai d, " Do you have one? "   And he said, " Ye s, I know one girl who is a good 

assist ant ."  And he t ook me.  The y
 didn't know that we  were married
 a nd this  is how we  be ga n to  
walk.  We walked from 
Carrera(ph) di Piatra(ph) probably tw
o or three days un
til we came to a  
point, which was LaDijing(p

a little further and 
we came to Toolchin(ph) and  
that i s where  the y ha d 
to fix up the hospital. 
Q: Who we nt to thi s hos pita

A: The hospital was, I imagine 
for Roma ni an s oldier s  and ma yb
e occ a sionally for a native who 
lived there, you know. 
 We were put into a ghetto in Toolchin(p

and e ver y morni ng we were take n out to the hosp

 No, we  never had

people, c oul dn't run.  So this wa s, I woul d say, as lar ge  as, ma ybe  
three or four  bloc ks.  On
e street .  And house s we re de molishe d 
from the war .  Most
 of the houses 
didn't have windows, I me an they 
had wi ndows, but no gla ss .  And wh
en we came t here, we li ved a 
sometimes four, so
metimes six to a 
room.  Wh en we were settled, we
 were, let's see,
 Sam's mother 
and sister lived in one r
oom and we found a possib
ility to move into anothe
r room, Sam and I.  And 
for a short whi le we lived alone and then they 
brought a ma n ver y sick 
wit h Typhus  and nobody 
wa nte d to l e t , to ha ve hi m, ca use i t  wa s ve ry c o
ntagi ous.  And we were ve
ry young, we didn't  car e, 
we didn't ha ve, we were not t hinking that s o met hi ng 
c oul d happen t o us in t hat wa y, s o t hey put hi m 
into our r oom a nd he shared t he, t his  was not a 
bed,  it was made of a pie c
e of wood, you know, but 
it was not directly on the floor, it 
was a little higher, so we shared th
is with him, what do you call 
this?  Not a bed. 

Q: Pl at for m?  

A: Yeah, something like that.  
Well, the man died after a fe
w days.  Sa m ha d a wonder ful  
convers ation wi th hi m.  He , he sa
id to Sam, "Someday 
when you sur vive , I wa
nt you to play the  
violi n on Yom Kippur for me
 a nd to play ______." 
 And you know, Sa m did it,
 la st ye ar.  He we nt  
over here t o a synagogue , to a Ra bbi Hol i en( ph), t o
ld hi m t he story and the  
rabbi s aid okay a nd he  
played it and it was beautiful. 

Q:  I  want  to do s o met h

A: Yes , it was or gani zed.  It wa s or
ga nize d.  But I don't know very mu
ch a b out it .  I know that ther e 
was, ther e were a couple or three mor e promi nent 
me n who ra n it, so to speak, Je wish.  But I hav e  
no ide a what  their  functi on wa s. 

Q: Who guar ded the ghett o?  

A: Well, I t h ink i t  was  Romani an
s and Germans, because, mo re Ro
ma nia n s I t hink, the  Roma nians 
had more of an authority there. 

Q: Werether e 
Je wi sh poli ce?  
A: I don't recall that. 

Q: Was there a system for you to get f
ood or get medical  help or anythi ng?  
A: I think there was some sort of
 a system t hat t he Jews among th
e ms el ves ma de , to have a s oup  
kitchen, I think there was th
at .  But  I do not  recall whet
her there was me dical help. 
Q: Were ther e any acti viti es i n t he 
ghe tto, di d people at  lea st pri vatel
y, wor s hip or  si ng or anythi ng?  
A: Yeah, maybe ther e was. 
 I don't recall exactly what
 it was, but I do recall 
that t here was one ver y  
talented poet who sort of made 
little ditties pertaining to the ghetto 
and put them to music and sang 
it for us and ma king
 fun of our lives, 
yes there wa s some. 
Q: S o t here  wa s. ..  

A: Not all the time. 

Q: But so there was some
, some  humor a nd s o me  wa
y t o comp ensat e for... 
A: Yes, yes, yes, that was. 

Q: Do you r e me mbe r  anythi ng a bou
t  convers ations or whet he r people
 had any t hought s about what  
wa s happe ni ng, whether or not  the y 'd be, ge
t t hrough this  or how t o get  thr o ugh it?  
A: Nobody.  I don
't rec al l  that anybody tal ked about thi s. 
 I know that when I discovered the hole 
underneath our fl oor  and I 
kne w t hat t he ti me  woul d c o me whe n 
we ha ve t o  run beca use  we alr ead y 
coul d hear  t he, the s hoot i ng, t he 
c annons a nd you c oul d hear  that  
they're coming cl
os er a nd the s e  
things don't happen overni
ght, not i n one da y.  And we kne w t h
at the Ukra i nians, who li ved out side 
the ghetto woul d not  hi de any of us .  The y woul
d si mpl y, e ven i f they wa
nte d to, t hey would be  
afr aid to do it because they woul d know t hat they
 couldn't get  away wit h it and we also knew that

you c oul dn't eve n hide i n a tree bec aus e they, it wa
s winter, t her e were no le aves , you couldn't hi de . 
So, so the only way t hat  I had th
e idea wa s that we s hould c ut ope n thi s fl oor a nd hi de underneath, 
whi ch e verybody thought was  ins ane. 
Q: Di d you have  contact  wit h 
the loca l Ukrain
ian population? 
A: Yes, a little bit, very little.  
There was one dentist, a Ukrainia
n who came to th
e hospital and 
when Sam needed, for  in
stanc e t o ma ke a  cr own for s o me body, he 
had to give it to 
this man, to thi s  
denti st, who wa s a techni ci
an, who made it and br ought
 it ba ck to hi m.  Thi s, he s ee me d  like a ver y  
dece nt guy. 

Q: Do you t h ink he  s hare d i n for ma tion wit h Sa m?  

A: Neve r, ne ver.  He never s poke about a nyt hing but t he de ntist ry. 

Q: It 's,  in  a wa y it  se e m
s a little far fetched that
 Sa m, all  of a  s u dde n on
e da y beca me  a  dentist .  
A: Yeah. 

Q: How did you pull  tha t  off?  

A: It  was unbelie vabl e, but you, bu
t i t was a matt er of l i fe and death.
  I f , if he didn't s ay he was  a  
dentist, he would have been killed.  He would have been sent across the ____. 
 And the, he didn't, he  
wa sn't so fri ghte ne d be c ause he ha
d next t o hi m t his good frie nd 
t he doct or, Dr. Rar d( p h), who wa s 
a ver y promi nent  surgeon and he wa
s  sure  that  Dr. Ra rd( ph)  woul d 
pull all the teeth for him.  And 
you know what happened to hi m.
  Dr . Rard( ph) had t o ope r ate on a Ger man c apt a i n who was  
brought in fr om the fr ont
 and he  di ed on t he  operat ing t abl e a n
d Dr . Ra rd( ph) was t ake n out and wa s  
shot .  And s uddenl y Sa m was wit h
out his frie nd and t he only thing we c o uld find was  an old book 

in the Russia n, whic h we ha
d to study, a dentistry book.  We  fo und
 it in the hospital 
and I read it t o  
Sam and translated it for hi
m.   Th at 's  ho w i t  wa s.  
Q: So every day you'd study a little
 dentistry and he fi gured it out? 
A: Yes , yes .  He wa s brill iant as a de nt ist.  He  pu
lled two of my  teeth, I don'
t know if I told you that. 
Q: _____ you all  deci
ded not to stick wi
th the profession.

A: He di dn't wa nt to, but the y
 offe red hi m at the Uni versi ty of Mi nne sota , a sc holarshi p or  
fellowship, they were so impressed.  He gave th
e m a speec h a bout his experienc es and they want ed 
hi m t o study, he  di dn't wa nt t o. 
Q: I ' m goi ng to wa it for t his air pla ne t o pas s over. 
 Your sis t er and mothe r-i

A: Sa m's si st er. 

Q: Ri ght, your si ster-i n-l aw. 

A: Yeah, ye s . 

Q: So t he y were a ble  to c o me t o Tool chin( ph) a s well?  

A: Yes .  

Q: I'm going to jump  ahead... 

A: Yeah. 

Q: To t he Czech ar my experi
ences.  After libe
ration you joined
 the Czech ar my?  
A: By the way, the liberation was 
a w ful.  When, when we fi nall y di
dn't hea r any mor e s h ooti ng and 
we wer e downstair s, s o me 78 peopl e, I don't r ec all 
exac tly how ma ny, we expecte d 18 pe ople t o be  
downstair s because t hose 18 people
 knew about what we 
were doing, you know, t hey were in the 
same area.  But  when t h e Ger mans 
r eally ha d t o retreat , t hey began 
to shoot people 
and so all  of a 
sudden they came in, came in, ca
me in and we were 78 a nd you kn
ow, we  were , right above us wa s  
our r oom a n d we, on t he  fl oor s ther e  was j ust str a
w, you know a nd t hen 
suddenly, we, we heard 
hea vy boots  like Ge r man boots, you 
know, you can't mistake that, abov
e us and we were
 as quiet as 
pos sibl e and we hea r d t he m spe a k Ge
r man.  We knew at that moment  
that  t hey must  ha ve found us , 
but it wa sn't.  They ha ppene d to have  entere d this 
room and they put a ca nnon i n fr ont of this room 
and they used that room to
 sleep over and we wer e  under neat h.  At
 first we were quite sure that they 
knew we are downstairs and they ar
e going to just kill us all.  Bu
t then, the next 
morning and you, 
we we re s o quiet , you c oul d just not  i ma gi ne how 
quiet you have to be a
nd t he next morni ng t he y  
left.  And after they left we were
 still there, quiet and 
then we decided we coul
dn't stand it any more,  
we could be gin t o fe el s moke  comi
ng thr ough and we deci de d we c o
uldn't do anything but at tha t  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0436

ti me  t hey ha d le ft.  And when we
 came out we wer e just pal e and gr een and, and there wer e a fe w 
Russia n part isans , maybe  boys of a ge  13 or 14 who ca
me a nd they looke d  at us and they said, in 
Ru ssian, _____, "And who are y
ou? "  The y didn't know who we  we
re .  And we a ske d the m, " A nd  
who are you? "  And they said, "M e Russ ki(ph) par tis
ani( ph) ."  The n all we coul d thi nk of wa s to ge t  

home .  But  that, that  wa s i mpossi ble .  That was 
not pos sibl e, we ha d no 
wa y how to get home . 
The n, one or  one tr ucker ca me by and ha d heard t h
at t here are some Jews 
who, ma ybe  Je ws ha ve  
something to give to them, maybe they'll give th
e m a ride .  And he sai d, "I f you gi ve me  s o me  
vodka , I take you t o _____."  So we
, so a group of us got together 
a nd whatever we sti ll had, a top  
or a blous e, or s o met hing, we  exch
a nge d wit h s o me  pe asa nts for vo
dka and we gave it to them and  
they took us.  And the y took us maybe two or thr
ee kilome ter s in a for est and dumped us in there  
and s aid, "The Ger ma ns didn't do a very good job w
ith you, t h ey should ha ve
 killed you all."  And 
then we  ha d to st
art walking, that 
was our liberation. 
Q: Di d you believe  you were r
eally liberated,
 I mean did... 
A: No, we c oul dn't beli e ve it, bec a
us e fir st of all t he war we nt bac k
 and for t h, it wa s 
not just in one 
directi on all the ti me.  The, the Ger ma ns ha d le ft
, t he Soviet s c a me bac k and you coul d think, okay, 
that's it.  No, then the Ge
r ma ns were l ucky or ther e were not e nou
gh Sovi e t sol diers  in t hat one spot, 
they came and took back part of that area agai n.  It
 was awfu l.  We were ,  we we re ab solut ely tor n  
bac k and for t h, we didn't know from 
mo ment t o mo ment w he n the Ge r m
a ns are goi ng to be bac k.  I t  
wa s unbelie vable .  

Q: At  wh at p oint  di d yo
u join the Czech army?  
A: When we came back to Czer
nowitz, in the hope of getting 
back to our ap
artment, Sam's  
apart me nt .  I  ne ver tr ied t o go home  t o Satta gur
a( ph) and at  Sa m's apart me nt were  s o me pe opl e who 
said, "You better get away 
from here before we call 
the police, because i f we
 call," t hese  were agai n 
the Sovie t s, "if we call t h e m, you'
re going to land in Siberia ."  And we ha d hear d fr om other pe opl e  
that t his is , i n fact ha s ha ppe ne d.  Pe ople who ha
d survived concentration 
ca mp and who coul d t hin k 
of nothing but to return to their home, returned to th
eir home where some pe
ople lived, wh o maybe 
paid nothing for that ap
artment of for that hous
e, but  c ons ide red it  their own a nd ha d a power ful

weapon, that all they had to do is to say, "These
 peopl e are no good, they are enemy of the state."  
And t hat 's al l.  So we quickly 
disappeared from t he, fr om t hi s ap
ar t ment ,  didn't pres s ure the m or  
anyt hing and it so happened t hat
 the Czech ar my pa
ssed by Czernowitz 
at  that ti me.   
Q: Wa nt to ask you a questi on, be fore you con
tinue .  Di d you t hink that ma ybe you'd be, your  
mother  woul d ret ur n
 at this point? 
A: I didn't even know whethe
r my mother was alive.  
I didn't know a nyt hing.   
Q: But ha d you thought  of
 going bac k to your ho
metown in case she wa
s ali ve and c o mi ng ho me?  
A: Never.  I never thought of goi
ng bac k to the homet o wn.  I couldn'
t even think of going back to 
this small town.  In that
 s mall t o wn, we  ha d hear d, 
this long back that the 
Je ws  that had not  gone  
away with the Russians were ki lled in the one ni
ght be fore the Ger ma ns c a
me to occupy the town, 
by the native people.  They were al
l herded together on one hill an
d they were all killed, I don't 
know how, I don't k
now whether they were shot 
or with knives or what,but they were all killed. 
Q: So you just had no 
thought of going back? 
A: Neve r.  
Q: Wh en, at this point 
di d you ha ve more infor m ation a bout t h
e ot her ca mps and the ki lling ce nter s, 
did you learn anything 
more at this point? 
A: We kne w  that there were, th
ere were ca mps, we kne w a b out
 M ogile v, you know Mogil ev a nd 
some ot her places in the vicini ty, 
Bar eshot(ph), I don't know i f thes
e, this means a
nyt hing.  But we 
didn't , the r e wa s no ti me  to dwell upon what 
happened i n those ot her c a mps beca use  you were  
constantly busy trying to survive. 

Q: What doe s 
that mean?  
A: What doe s it mea n?   I don't  know wh
at it  mea n s beca use  rea lly you... 

Q: Bus y tr yi ng to sur vi ve . 

A: Yo u wer e  not i nv olv ed with wha t  we nt o n so me
where else, you al so didn't know it , ther e were  
no ne wspa pe rs.  You de pended maybe on the ru mors an
d in fa ct, you di dn't  wa
nt t o know too much, 
all you wa nt ed to, was fr om da y to
 day to see whether you c o uld ma ke
 it.  I don't know how else to 
explain this.

Q: You've told me a little bit about
 the Czech army before
.  I'm, I'd love to 
hear a little bit abou t 
some  of the place s t hat  you lib
er ated wit h t he Czech ar my. 
A: Yeah?  
Q: Wh at kind of ex
perience t hat was. 
A: Yes.  We  were, in the Czech 
ar my, I ha ve to sa y, it wa s a  moment
 of a  wonder ful  fe eling, t o not  
be less than a louse, as we were in t he concentr
a tion ca mp where the y ha d power ove r  us and we  
had not hing.  In the Cze ch ar my we  were c onsta
ntly facing the enemy, 
ma ybe one or two mil e s  
away, no more.  Th e Ge rman
s  were  in fr ont  of us, t he Sovi et s we
re  be hi nd us or next  to us .  We  
were allied soldiers of the Soviets.  But, the se
nse of camaraderie between 
the people in the Czech 
ar my was absolut ely magni f
icent, these were Jews, but
 not  all of t he m we re 
Jews, there were quite a  
fe w non-Jews.  Thes
e were people who had r
un away fr om Hitler into 
Poland, when  Hitler 
occ upie d Cz echoslova kia .  In Pola nd, they didn't 
know t hat the Soviets woul
d occ upy that part of 
Pol and and when the Soviets came
, t he Soviet s r egar ded 
thes e pe ople as unreli abl es a nd put t he m  
into Siberia.  Cause they said they
 weren't sure who they are.  And in
 Siber i a, at a ce
rtai n mo me nt in  
ti me , t her e was, everyone who wa
s Czech was asked to join the 
Czech ar my.  The Czech ar my 
consisted of all kinds of
 peopl e, Je ws and non-Je ws, but mostl y
 Jews.  Women, c hildren, old people,  
sick people , anybody who could wal
k, joine d the  ar my.  It be gan i n 
Boos oul ouk(ph), in the , in t he  
very i nteri or  of Soviet Russia , 
wher e, where the maj orit y wer e concentr at ed and ther e were about 
5,000 pe ople  who made up thi s ar my . 
 These people were s o ma gni fice
nt, mo st of them very, very 
well... 

[End of Si de 1 of Tape 2] 

Q: Okay, you were
 talking about the Czech ar my? 
A: Ye ah and this ma n, who had ru
n a wa y fr om Pr ague, his na me wa
s Ed Haa s , H- a-a- s.  Wh e n h e  
ca me, whe n the Soviet s got hol d of hi m a nd he  
said he  was bor n in Pr
ague, Czec hosl ova kia and 
they found hi m in Poland.  He s aid, t hey a ske d hi
m, li ke t hey ask e ver ybo
dy, what is your father 's 
na me , be cause you know in the Sovi
ets, the fat her 's name i s al ways
 part of your na me and he sa i d , 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0436  
25 
 
 
"My father 's na me is Adolph( ph) ."  "Adol ph( ph) , thr
ee year s."  Si mpl y because thi s was the name of 
Hitler. 
Q: But tell me a little bit about, for exa mple ,  
you libe r at ed Prague, what
 was that like, wha t  
happe ned?  

A: It was very, very wonderful .  Fi rs
t of all, we lost many 
of our soldi ers be fore that .  We  starte d out 
in the Ukra i ne and went  by wa y of Ducla( ph) , whi c h 
is a pass in the Carpathian, in the Tatra(ph).  

And the Duc l a(ph) pas s, we were 
hel d up endle ss l y long, it was di ffic ult t o get thr ough and it was 
held by ver y  fe w Ger ma ns  but the y wer e  on the top 
and the y sa w us and we we
re on, in the valley.  
And anyway, ma ny, ma ny wee ks i t  
took be fore we could ta ke the Du
cla( ph) pa ss a nd then, the n we  
wer e , we e n ded t he war , the war wa s at an e nd wh en
 we liberat ed Prague.  Wh
at was it like?  It was 
for us very wonder ful a nd for t he peopl e of Pr a
gue I don't know.  The y must ha ve  had mixe d 
fe elings bec ause t hey al so di dn't
 know what is in store for them. 
 One thing that 
I r e me mbe r  th at 
turne d me off a nd ma de  me wa nt t o lea ve Eu
rope for good was when
 we , we h a d sur viv ed  
concentr ation camp and wa
s now i n the Cze ch uni fo
rm and when we came to the fi rst city in 
Slova kia, Koshit za( ph) , we got or der s to arre st a
nybody i n t h e stre et who 
spe a ks  Ger ma n.   An d I  
said, "Sam, this is not for me.  We
 wer e in a situati on whe r e we  were perse c uted for no r eason at all , 
I do not wa nt to be part of a gr
oup of people who perse cut e some bo
dy for spea king any language.  I  
don't want to live there." 
 And that is when I de
ci ded, no more Eur ope.  Th
at was the ti me.  And by 
the way, when Pr esi dent  Benish( ph), who was the 
Pres ide nt of Czec hosl ova kia , retur ned for the  
very fi rst ti me fr om London to Kos hitza( ph) , to 
the first town in Czechos
lovakia, it was Sam who 
conducted the orchestra fo
r his welcome and he still 
has the program
 to show. 
Q: But whe n  you went  int o t hes
e towns, I me an you weren't a so
ldier before, wh
at did you do? 
A: I wa s a  s o ldier.  

Q: Then. 

A: I  lear ne d very fast  to
 be a  s oldie r, but what di d I do most
l y ?   I use d my  langua ge s very muc h, I  
transl ated fr om all  ki nds of Sl av
ic languages to German
 or  vice versa and t hey
 needed people who 
did t hat because when t he
y, when t hey took, t hey we
re the Czech ar my and wh
en t hey were in nee d

of to talk to someone who spok
e Ger man, that 's  what we di d.  
We al so used our musical gi fts  
whenever  we could.  Sa
m conduct ed a n orche stra, but not  
all day, only in the evening and I 
collect ed fol k songs in Czech, in Sl ovak, in Russ
ian and sang them for the 
soldi ers.  And I knew, 
wh en  I wa s sent  o ut wit h thi s,  I 
would be si nging a  concert  for a b
out s everal hundre d  or t housa nd  
soldi ers a nd the ne xt da y I would be s ent to a ho
spital and fi nd, this was 
a s mall a r my, I kne w ma ny 
of these soldiers personally.  Fo
und the m without ar ms , 
without  legs, that wa s kind of tough be caus e  
you s ee the terrain t hat we got to 
work on was, the Rus sians  gave 
us tha t  terrain whi ch was ver y  
difficult and it was very mu
ch mi ned.  There were lots
 of mines there.  Many 
of our frie nds lost their  
eyes and some got killed. 
Q: So you were really in battle? 

A: Al l the time, all the time . 

Q: And you had a gun? 

A: Yes .  

Q: Di d you use it?  

A: I didn't use it, but I l earne d how 
to use it.  I was lucky, I never 
was in a situation to just face, 
because I have a feel
ing they would have 
killed me first.  I don't know
, I don't think I could kill a  
pers on. 

Q: But you c a me i n c ont a ct w
ith, did you come  i n c onta c
t wit h a n opposi ng a r my?  
A: We were,  we wer e , on e nig ht, 
I 'll t ell you thi s, one night we  were
 i n a pe asant 's hut , s l eepi ng a nd  
it was summer, windows  were ope n 
and I woke up, I 've a ve ry light
 slee p and I sa w a, a Ger ma n  
hel met s nea k by the wi ndow and I pushed Sa m a nd 
I said, "The Ger mans are here ."  And he was  
very tired, he said, "Let 
me  sleep."  An d I didn't sa
y anythi ng, t hey di dn't co
me  in.  You know what  
we found?   That  s o me c hickens , 
t hat  the pre vious  da y we had orga
nize d, they had 
come  by and t hey  
had stol en t h ose c hic kens .  And that wa s, t hat

the m a nd then the y br ought us ba ck t o New York
 and t hen we  were on t he  wa y to Sout h Ame r ic a  
and all  I coul d t hink of was I  want
 to live in the United States. 
Q: What we re your fir st  i mpr essi

A: Yeah. 

Q: Wh at were your impression
s of Ne w York or America? 
A: Fa ntastic, I kept thinking, how 
is it possi ble that in, 
on one and the same 
planet, there is one 
place whi ch is hell, Eur o pe and t hen 
we co me here and thi s i s paradi
se.  People were
 so friendl y. 
You know people , ever ybody s aid, "How ar e you?
"  And ever ybody ans wer

coul dn't beli eve it .  Ever ybody was 
just fine.  I hadn't h
eard things like that in
 years.  It was an 
unbelie vabl e  at mos phere.  I loved it, I  fel l  in l ove wit h
 this country and it's last

a tremendous feelin
g for this countr y. 

Q: Were you surprised by th

A: Yes, yes.  But it  was l ess t he  ab

people  her e i n t he Unite d State s, ma de  us  believe a gain. 

Q: That quic kly?  

A: No, not t hat quic kly, not t h
at qui ckly, but it wa s gra duall y.  
But one thing I kn

mysel f , i f  I  c a n I  wa nt t o come
 ba ck t o t he Unite d State s.   
Q: So your visa wa s to
 go to Sout h Ameri ca?  
A: Yes .  

Q: And so you could not stay? 

A: No. 

Q: You wo uld have

A: No, I don't know that because our, our desti n

 But I found out very 
quickly that I never wa

 Barankia(ph). 
Q: Colu mbia? 

A: Yea h.  And pr obabl y two or th
re e days later we we nt, we fl ew 
to Barankia(ph) 
Col u mb ia an d we  
ca me t o my uncl e, who wa s not t her e, who was on 
his  finka( ph) , whi ch i s a,
 a pla ntat i on, a  coffee  
plant ation in the Sier ra Neva da.  An
d he ha d le ft word with s o meone 
there to bring us
 to him.  And 
so we  we nt,  this  was  a , 
quite a trip, for the first 
ti me  in my l i fe , on a ve
r y s ma ll ai rpl ane , li ke a  
double dec k er, I don't know.  And t h
i s plane woul dn't take off, it c
ouldn't take off a nd ever y ti me it  
took off we  stoppe d again and th
en waite d a fe w hour s 
until they repaired 
it and then the same  
thing,  We ll anyway, we ca
me to a small village, an hour later 
and in this small 
village we, there  
was a ma n who was a 
friend of my uncles
, who, who br ought us to a pl
ace where there wer e several  
natives wi th hors es  and t hey
 put us on horses and 
I had never  bee n on a horse be fore and we  went  
for about si x hour s through the j ungl e and they we nt  ahe ad of us and cut, cut open t he jungle to 

ma ke r oom and you c ould see  be hi
nd you how it  close d a gai n and 
you know, I saw my  first sna k e 
there.  I have a snake here
.  You don't wa nt t o se e i t , no?   And,
 not li ve .  And we c a me t o the uncle 's  
fi nka (ph) and that was our first ti me here in S out h Amer ica.  We st ayed
 there for  six mont hs. 
Co uldn't stand it. 

Q: Wh y?  

A: There 's a  di ffere nt wa y of li fe .  M y uncle  di d no
t want me t o ha ve anythi
ng t o do wit h music.  He  
wa s a business ma n, ver y highly r es pecte d in t h e 
communit y, he was a very ri ch ma n and he al s o  
didn't wa nt them to know
 that Sam was a musici an
 and it was all so very 
unpleasant because of th e 
way they looked at things, the attit
ude.  And one day my 
uncle said, "Somebody 
told me that the y  
sa w you in t he stre et some
where wi th a vi olin c ase."  And he said, " Yea h we went t o this fa mil y  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0436

____, who has a pi
ano and were going to try 
to see how much we
 still remember."
  And my uncle 
said, " N o, I don't want  to 
hea r that a n y more.  I f you nee d a pi
ano, I 'll buy a pia no a nd i t 'll be i n t he  
house .  I don't want you t o
 go to other  people t o pl ay."  And ea
ch day I li ke d that plac e l ess a nd l ess  
and t he n I found out that I 
wa s pre gna nt and I deci ded I don't t o 
ha ve a chil d born t here .   But I di d 
know t hat I wa nte d to ha ve a chil d born in the Uni t ed St ates .  And so I we nt ever y da y to the cons ul  
until one day he told me, 
"Yes, now you are ready to
 go."  So we came he
re and our Gloria was 
bor n here . 

Q: I 'm a litt l e bit curi ous  whe n you, when you,
 well I gue ss  both when you fi rst arri ved t o New 
York, but more when you 
got to Col u mbia .  Di d you tal k about 
your e xperienc es a t a ll, di d your  
uncl e wa nt t o know what  ha d ha ppe ned?  

A: I came to, I didn't, I don't know
 if I ever told you th
is , whe n we wer e  in Ne w Yor k, my un cle h a d 
sent  $200, s o that we  s h oul d have
 s o me  mo ne y i f  w e  n
eed it and thi s was Dece
mb er 22, 1945.  It 
was a bli zzard and we we
re without , we wer e  in  uni for m a n
d without a coat, Cz
ech uni for m, we 
didn't have a nyt hing else and Sa m a nd I went out , 
t o one block awa y, t o Broadway a nd we s aw t his  
drugstore wi th a display of soap in the window and 
we hadn't seen soap fo r th
ree years and I sai d t o  
Sa m, "The y are als o s wi ndl
er s, t he y put , the y put  somet hing i nto
 t he wi ndow to prete n d it 's soap, 
but I'm sure it's not soap."  An d 
I coul d spe ak Engl ish, he c oul dn't .  So I we nt insi de a nd I wa nted t o 
see what t he man will  say to me 
i f I wa nte d to buy a  pi ece of so
a p a nd I ca me i n, nobody wa s i n  
exce pt the man and I and I say, " I  
want to buy a piece of Sweetheart 
soap," cause t hat was what was  
in the window.  He said, "One pi
ece , woul dn't you want t o ha ve 
t wo for 29?"  An
d I t hought to 
myself he's stalling, he's stalling.  
Wh at is he going to say?  I sai
d, "Yes, I could have
 two."  So he 
disa ppe ars behind the c o unter a nd wr aps s o methi ng up
 and sa ys, " 29 ce nts  plus tax."  I  don't know 
what, 32 ce nts and he gives me a pac k age and I pa y a
nd I co me  out and I didn't belie ve t hat he rea lly 
gave me somet hing so right out in t his bli zzar d 
I open it and I smell it and I nearl y fainted, it was 
soa p.  And I said, " Sa m, you know
, he didn't se e you, he doe s n 't  k
now that you belo
ng to me .  You 
coul d go i n a nd j ust say s oap and yo
u can say t wo soa p a nd we  coul d ha
ve four piec es of soa p."   He  
went in, he comes out w
ith t wo pieces of soap.  Now we have 
four pi eces of soap and we walk a

short bloc k a nd ther e is anot her dr ugs tore.  And now I sai d, " You know, t hey don't know here tha t  
we bought it there." 
 So I  go in a nd I buy a gai
n t w o pi ece s of s oap and t he n
 he  goes  in.  To make a  
long story short, we spent all th
at money on soap and 
we c a me to my uncl e in Sout h America wit h 
a, we had to buy a suit case to put in the soap 
and we brought this s o ap
 to my uncle in Sout h  
Ameri ca.  And he , who thought 
it was wonderfu l that 
we c a me , a nd  we to
ld hi m nobody shoul d  
know, look what we ha ve 
and he looke d at that  and he kne w 
that we wer e  nut s.  He kne w t h at 
somet hing wa s very wrong wit h us.  He tol d this
 to me ma ny mo nth s  late

i mpres sion my uncl e ha d of us.  

Q: But he  was nice?  

A: Oh, he was wonderfu l, 
he wa s very wonderful. 
Q: You di dn't even ha ve  s oap

Q: Di d your  uncl e wa nt t o know?  

A: Not reall y , not  reall y. 

Q: Di d your  relatives i n t he Stat es wa nt t o know?  

A: Not really, they said they 
wanted to know but, you know, wh

coul d see  the i r eyes  were  gl

i s t his  goi ng to fini sh?  
Q: They believed it? 

A: Yes.  They believed it when it ha
d to do wi th the Nazi s, the y  did not bel i eve it when i t  had to do 
with the Soviets.  We

with that. 
Q: So t he y didn't, he  di dn't

A: Ye ah, he  didn't wa nt me to te

my uncle was flabbe

"What will you be in the United St
ates, nothing but a number.  Here 
you are a, a señora.  I said, "I 
wa nt to be a number a mo ng numbers
, instead of a señora among slaves
.  Ca n't st and th

then I sai d, " We've l ost al ready to

 We 've had to be in

 But it is very difficult.

that reli gion is the opium of t he pe ople , i f you 
have hear d t his expre ssi on.  And the  Soviets have 
replaced it wit h their own kind 
of religion, their ideology.  Yes,
 I went through all of these 
difficulties.   
Q: Di d you, do you ha ve  a se
nse of religion or, today? 

A: I  ca n't  sa y.  I have a  very stra
nge and inte resti ng sense of huma n
ity in me.  I do
n't have a sense  
of, I t hink when I hear  of or gani ze d religi on, 
whi ch, whic h pr oduces hate , like t h e Ayatollah  
Khomei ni, t hat is, I thi n k the most a w ful thing that 
you ca n i ma gine.  It see ms to me t hat a, a se ns e 
of huma nity and ethics
 is  what I  woul d c onside r my reli gi on. 
Q: So you ne ver r etur ne d to J udais m i n a ny way?  

A: I do not know reall y what
 I am, but I do know that
 I have t he hi ghest fe elings for  Isr ael, for th e  
state of Israel.  And t he great est pri de t hat t here 
is such a st ate.  I f yo
u can unders ta nd how t his  
works , I don't know.  But  I coul d, I 've  been t r yi ng 
to think about it and it is 
di ffic ult to underst and,  
you know, when I was a c hild, there wa
s this tea cher, Hebr e w teacher, who wa s trying to teach us t o  

read Hebrew, but he neither explai
ned each word by itsel f, nor did I 
know what he wa
s sayi ng.  And  
he ne ver bot here d, or ma ybe he, ma ybe that wa s t h
e way it wa s taught, but I,
 it remained out of my 
____, where  in my mi nd I was al
wa ys c urious a bout langua ges a nd I woul d ha ve li ked t o know  
more about this language, 
this ma n was not fort hc oming to gi ve it 
to me, so I gave it up.  And that is 
all I know about He bre w.  I  di dn't wa nt t o le ar
n to re ad Hebre w whe n  
I don't know what I'm 
readi ng.  Because it di d not coi nci
de  wit h all t he other  la ngua ges , 
10 of them, when
 I r ead t hem, I  
know what I  read, 
unfortunatel y. 
Q: Was  it di ffic ult  to be gi n a ne w her e ? 

A: It was not difficult, it 
wa s mag ni fi cent .  It was ,  we wer e  s o 
full of hope that we ar e i n, i n a new 
country, not just country 
so, t he whol e wa y of li fe  is so di ffere
nt.  We we nt  about it, we  were ver y  
excite d.  And we ha d a baby and 
the baby was bor n her e in Phila
del phi a and Sa m, who c oul dn't  
spea k Engli s h, found a 
job to pla y the violi n an
d everythi ng wa s  wonde r ful .  
No, it was not difficult .  
An d we never felt that we  had to
 ask some body for help.  We  we
re so proud.  
You know, it took

years a nd ye ars be fore I ev
er heard t hat ther e was such a thi n g 
like a, a family service, who helps 
people , s o we never  di d.  We  wer e
 re a lly very str o ng, I  mus t  s a y. 
Q: Wasn't  it hard to get ov
er what  you ha d experie nce d?  
A: Yes, ther e were  thos e ni ght ma
res.  I couldn't talk about it 
and when Sam tal k
e d  about  it, I  
coul dn't sta y in t he r oo m.  But the se were, as  ti me  we nt
 by, l ess  and l ess .  But it
 took a b out  10 year s.   
Q: What wer e your bi gg
e st chall enges ?   You must  have ha d 
some , I mea n you were st a r ting a ne w 
life here. 

A: I can't, I don't know. 

Q: It c oul dn't  ha ve
 been t hat easy. 
A: I don't know, we had a 
wonderful attitu
de, I think. 
Q: Were there certain kinds of activities that help
ed you connect wit h the lif
e here?  Certain things 

you did?  

A: We didn't ha ve mone y.  We liv
e d  in a  very poor nei ghbor hood,
 in a one r oom, not  apar t ment ,  
one room in a house of a ma n who 
wa nte d me t o write re cei pts, he wa s a landl ord, write re ceipt s  
when t he pe ople  br ought  the money.
  And for t his  he gave us a 
room, whe r e the  one window went  
directl y t o a not her wa ll.  So we l i ve d ver y pri miti
vely and we  were a s hap
py as c an be  bec aus e i t  
was still so much better than what 
we had before.  You k
now, everything is ju
st relative.  And I 
taught Sa m Englis h, I r e ad to hi m 
books , e ndle ssl y.  And our , our best 
way to ent ertai n us was to go 
to t he l ibrar y.  It didn't  c o st a nyt hing a nd 
we kept on re adi ng.  That was our  begi nni ng. 
Q: And he was playin

A: Yes, yes. 

Q: And he became  a ve

A: Yes, yes... 

Q: ...musician. 

A: Yes .  

Q: Was  it ea sy t o ma ke  new frie nds?

A: I don't know.  Yes and no.  I 
don't, I don't think th
at we  ha ve eve r , we 'v
e been the two of us, 
rather self-sustaining because of 
the circumst ances and after that, 
al so because of cir cumstances,  
maybe it's a baby and th
en his mother 
came and was very ill.
  She had cancer 
of the stomach and 
died in our house a
nd at that time, she 
was ill about eight mo
nths, the doctor ga
ve her six, and we 
had no insurance, it
 was tough.  But so
mehow, the fact that we  had su
rvived the Holo
caust and that 
we  coul d be here  in thi s 
c ountry, we  j ust 
thought nothing can 
hurt us any more. 
Q: Is that true? 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Was there any sense of, I don't 
know, i sol ation or  bei ng di ff erent  be caus e of your  e x perie nce s?  
A: Yes... 

Q: At  le ast i n t he be ginni ng?  

A: Yes, it still is, even to this 
da y.  We have a fe w frie nds, but we 
ar e ver y much aware, they di dn't  
go through wh at we  did and it's
 di ffer ent, it 's di ffer ent. 
Q: Did you, you sai d you coul dn't 
tal k  about it much, but did you ta
l k with Sa m a bout how you fel t  
and what... 

A: No.  No, beca use he wa
s not r ece ptive t o tal k about it, I woul d ha ve li ked t o talk, more rec entl y, 
but he j ust , i s not, I don'
t know how, how to put it, 
he's  not interested to talk about things that you 
can't c ha nge . 

Q: No w t his  is pr ob abl y a n u nu s
ua l question but , I ' m curi
ous, there have bee n, now that you've  be en 
in t his  countr y for 50 ye ar s... 

A: Yes .  

Q: Were there certain historical events that yo
u t hink you e x perie nce d di ffe rentl y or wer e very 
signi fica nt to you beca use  of yo

 Wa r  and, a nd, a n d the  Sovi et Uni on, M c Carthyi s m, Ci vil Rights , 
the Eic h ma nn(ph) tri al, a nyt hing?  

A: Ye ah, ye ah, yea h, ye a h.  Well, on

l fe elings I have to 
this day is President 
Truma n , be c ause he happened t o be Presi de nt when

people and t hey sai d, "Tr u man sti nks
," I was so  frightened that I sai
d, "Sa m, we  di dn't sa y it, but we  
hear d it."   And we i m me diatel y le ft 
t heir home .  We  could, I didn't wa nt
 to stay in their house.  And 
I took it ve r y seriousl y and toda y I know t hat t hey
 keep on saying the 
sa me thi ng about every 
president.  It's sort of a wa y th
at Americans like to talk.  They, th
ey don't take it as seriously as I 
hear d it . 
Q: Well you thought you wo ul
d be found out as an enemy 
of t he state  or  s o met hing?  
A: Yes, yes. 

Q: Do you re me mber  whe n 
Israel  became a stat e? 
A: Yes .  

Q: How you fel t  a bout t ha t ? 

A: Very e xci ted.  Very e xcite d.  
I thought it was wo
nder ful .  And we know some pe ople her e who  
be frie nded us, who are Je wis h, who 
think I srae l  s h oul d not be a  state .
  And you can't imagine wh at a 
shock this was to me , why?  An
d they said, "Because
 it's not necessary.
"  And I will never  
underst and t hat a nd I had to 
accept t h e fact that i f I wanted to c
onti nue bei n g friends wit h the m or at  
least seei ng t hem, I must  stay
 a wa y fr om t his  dis c ussi on be ca use it  just bot here d me . 

Q: Di d you feel that by 
Israel becomi ng a st ate t hat  there was 
some refuge , some safe place for Jews  
fi nall y?  

A: Yes, yes. 

Q: And you still fe el that way? 

A: Yes .  

Q: Do you re me mber  th
e Eich mann(ph) tri al? 
A: Yeah, sur e. 

Q: I mean, I guess 
what I'm asking here is, were these even
ts a little bit differen
t for you than they 
mi ght  ha ve  been for  me?  

A: I don't know about t h e Eic h mann( ph) tria l.  It 's
 too di ffic ul t to know 
what went on, you know. 
You know, it 's very st r ange, thi s whole t hi

Eichmann's(ph), you know, not 
t hat  particul ar one .  And his  tria l wa
s ver y fa r a way fr om  us .  I have  
no ide a how that a f fect ed me .  
I can't  s ay one wa y or a not her .  
Q: Well, let's talk about so
mething recent.  Th e situa
tion with the Palestinians. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: Do you have any fe elings a bou
t  that , the way that t hey have 
been thought of or treated or 
anyt hing _____ ?  

A: I, I have some feelings, I do
n't believe that by gi
ving away land you will 
have peace.  I can't  
belie ve it.  This is a ver y s mall countr y, Isra el and 
I don't think that the Pales
tinia ns or a ny one of, of  
these people who wish Isr
ael ill are going to change 
their colors, their attit
udes.  I simply can't 
believe it. It's hard. 

Q: On t he  ot her ha nd, Pal estini ans  ar e 
living in pretty ro
ugh circumstances. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Do you have  any sympathy for  tha t? 

A: This is hard for me to expl
ain because I  know ver y lit tle about
 it and I 've not  
spent much time 
thinking about it. 

Q: What a bout, do you re me mb
er  the period of Mc Cart hyi s m?  
A: Yes .  By t hat ti me , we wer e ver y ne w here and I did not unde rstand it ver y  well , bec aus e in some  

ways I thought there were a fe w Co
mmunists here.  So I don't know, 
I, whether I thought I, I didn't  
like t he man and the way he went ab
out it and I didn't quite
 underst and what he wa
s aft er, but  I, but  
I thought that the Am
ericans were ver y nai ve about their, a
bout what goes on in 
Sovie t  Russi a.  I 
still think. 

Q: But I t hink, you know, whe n you 
t a lk a bout how he  was  going a bou
t it  a n d what he  was a fter... 
A: Yeah. 

Q: ...it 's reall y t he conce p t of the  witc h hunt. 

A: Yes, yes. Guilt by asso
ciation and I, it's, 
it's, it's bad, you 
know.  And particularly in a country 
like t his one, wher e fr eedom 
of speech is so importan
t or freedom of thought. 
Q: Any thoughts  a bout t h
e ci vil ri ght s move me nt?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0436

A: No.  I don't know. 
Q: Oka y, okay, I won't pursue this ____, but you know, it 's j ust, it 's just i ntere sting be caus e thes e 

wer e all  very signi ficant  event s i n American histor y. 

A: Sure, sure, absolutely. 

Q: I just didn't know if
 they impacted you... 
A: Yeah. 

Q: ...di ffere ntly.  What  s o rt 
of, we ll you we nt on a n d you we nt
 back to music 
and you t aught?  
A: Yeah, yea h, ye ah. 

Q: Here in Philadelphia? 

A: I ta ught here i n Phi ladelphi a, I t aught at  
Te mpl e  Universit y a nd at Sett le ment Sc hool. 
Q: You ta ught piano?  

A: At Settlement Sc
hool I've taught piano, at
 Temple I taught diction in
 foreign langua
ges for voice 
maj ors .  

Q: What 's, you've me nti o ned a fe w 
thi ngs , what sort of long ter m i m
pact di d these earl y  experiences 
have on you, in ter ms of ma ybe how you r aise d your
 daughte r , your val ues , 
the way you, your s ens e  
of tr ust  or  se curity?  

A: I don't know.  I think that I continue very much 
to have the attitude that I had when I grew up.  I 
a m hopeles sl y old fas hi oned.  I a m not  in fa vor of 
l i ving togethe r  without bei ng marrie d.  What els e  
should I tell you, you 
would be  s hoc ked. 
Q: No, tell me. 

A: No.  I really think that these 
val ue s  that I 've had and that I 've  never ra mmed down my daught er 's  

throat , but s o mehow she  had 
witnessed in her life  near us, what 
is important to us.  And it feels to 
me that they, that these 
values have give n me  a strong sense  
of being st e ady.  
So me ti me s I had  a  
feeling that I  was on an ocean t o
ssed back and for th an
d, and i f I didn't have
 the strengt h, I couldn't  
survi ve it .  And I had t he stre ngt h and I t hink t hat 's
 why I s urvi ved.  And I 
continue to think that 
wa y, ol d fas hioned.  Tha t 's how it is.  

Q: Basic values? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0436

A: Basic  val ues , te rribl y i mporta nt .  
Q: Do you think that you 
raise d your daughter  di ffe rently beca
use of your Holoca
ust  e xperienc es?  
A: That I don't know.  I suppose 
because of these experiences I ha
ve often found my self a little bit  
impatient.  Impatient with
 stupidity.  I 
can't stand it when, 
when I detect a little
 less than common 
sens e.  All  I 'm as king i s c o mmon s ens e.
  I don't know if th
at  makes  se ns e.  
Q: Well , I ' m trying t o understa nd
 how that relates to 
your exper iences or where t hat  came fro m?  
A: I don't know if it comes fr om
 t hat  or i f it doesn't.   
Q: Do you think that you mi ght
, you mi ght  ha ve bee n more an
d ma ybe you weren't this way, 
prote ctive or  fear ful or any of t hat sort  of 
thi ng, bec ause  of what  you ha d gone thr ough?  
A: It could be, I don't know
, I don't know.  
But I do know that 
I a m, for a l ong ti me  I ha ve  bee n ver y  
much aware that I have t o  be one st
e p ahea d of danger.  I use d t o wa
lk in the street 
in Ne w Yor k  an d  
I use d t o ha ve a  feeli ng, if I hear d t h e sa me  ste p be
hi nd me for a coupl e of st ep
s, that this is surely 
some body who is a fter  me.  I ha d t his  fo
r a  l ong ti me , couldn't  get ri d of thi s. 
Q: So t hat  even here , yo
u didn't  feel  e n tirely sa fe?  

A: Absolutely, absolutely. 

Q: Are t here certai n sounds or sm
ell s that bri ng back me mori es? 
A: Not now, not any more.  
Used to be when a, when an airplane was, was coming by real low, that 
I would shri nk, but  
not now any more. 
Q: Are t here  certai n i ma g es t hat ha unt  you?  

A: No, but I cannot watch 
on television anyt
hing that has to do with k
illing, can't stand it.  I don't 
eve n wa nt t o  he ar a  st ory about it , I don't  want , not  
onl y not  see  it, I  ca n't , I  don't li ke it on t he r adi o, 
I don't like to read it in the news
paper and I find it absolutely un
believable that in this country,  
where it 's  possibl e t o li ve  like  huma n beings , t hat 
there's so much cri me.  
An d I don't have in my  
house  any guns  a nd I 
wouldn't  ha ve  one. 
Q: Do you t h ink that , ha vi ng the se experienc es  infl
uenced the wa y you dec i de
d to li ve your  li fe?  
A: I don't know that.  Be cause wh
en it happened, when it 
began to happen to 
me, let's call it since 
1937 it bega n, be cause the anti- Se miti
sm in Roma nia was al
ready rampant at that
 time, this was the

______ ti me .  And I was 16.  Tha t
's whe n, that 's whe n it  bega n.  To be, it, whe n it beca me  
conscious.  It happened at th
e time  when, I don't ho
w I would have turned
 out had this not 
happe ned, I  have no ide a . 
Q: Di d you a nd Sa m e ver  think a bout hi

A: We were offered a hiding place 
by a Catholic priest an
d we  wer e hidi ng one

the church a nd the  next  morn... 

[End of Si de 1 of Tape 3] 

Q: You were  hi ding i n t h e or ga n?  

A: Yes .  

Q: And what  ha ppene d?  

A: A priest, a Jesuit prie
s t  in Cz ernowitz, offere d us hi ding.  
Hi s na me  was  Fat her
 Komorovitch(ph) 
and at fi rst we t hought t his coul d be our s alvati o
n and we s aid oka y and we
 we nt an d we wer e  on e

t stand it.  The 
thought t h at Sa m's  mot her 
a nd sist e r  we re i n, at  
home in t he apart ment and 
that they would be  ta ken, I couldn't 
stand it  a nd so we  sai d goodbye t o  
the prie st and we we nt di rectly 
home and ma ybe a n hour later t hey 
ca me for us and t ook us into the  
ghett o, yeah. 

Q: I f you ha d t o, the  wor d s urvi vor pr oba bly mea n
s a lot of di ff erent thin

A: Sure. 

Q: That i f you had to summar ize a 
commonality that survi
vor s shar e, is t h ere somethi n g?  Either in  

terms of experience or in
 terms of, how it, how th
a t  li fe  change d people?  
A: I have no idea.  This to me is so incomprehens
i ble.  I wis h I  kne w.  I ha ve no idea what make s a  
pers on a s ur vivor a nd another  one not.
  Of c ourse , you ha ve t o ha ve 
hea l t h.  I f  you don't ha ve t hat,  
we have seen too many people peri

by the wayside.  You ha

Eve ryt hing e l se, I t hink you ha ve t o r e mai n wit h a

ought t hat  when you are  
in s uch da nger, you ha ve to ha ve 
an even cooler head an

But  I  ha ve  no i dea  how t hat works.

Q: What about, when I use the te
r m survivor i n the sens e of havi
ng gone t hrough th
ese experiences,  
was t here a commonalit y 
to t he experi ences?  
A: I suppose  so.  I suppose that 
whe n  you find, i n the experie n ce of
 the c oncentra tion ca mp, pe opl e  
who befriend you.  Th
ey, they'll be most wonder
ful and do everything and 
you will do everything . 
And then you will find others who 
take everything away fr om you.  
So it is, I think it is the sa me,  
like in the rest 
of t he wor ld. 
Q: Wa s there something in the 
pr oc ess of dehuma nizi ng you, of 
havi ng, so mebody havi ng this  
contr ol over  your lives and a busi ng that contr o l,
 that you t hink is common to the experience  
perhaps?  I'm not trying to
 put  wor ds in your mout h... 
A: Yeah, yea h, no. 
Q: ...I 'm just  tryi ng t o underst an
d, your e xpe rienc e is di ffer ent  tha n
 ma ny other people  I 've tal ke d t o  
and yet you've all had you
r li ves  tor n apart , disr upt ed, lost fa mil y... 
A: Ye ah, ye s, e xactl y, e xactl y.  I thi nk a  per sona l
 experie nce  of s o me one  cont rolli ng my li fe li ke  
that, I, I can't think.  But I also
 t hought that , be ca use of Sa m, wh
o pr otec te d me, I t hink that I wa s  
onl y too wil l i ng t o be protected and to
o grat e ful a n d to thi s da y I 'm grat e ful  to hi m.  But  I have no 
idea, I think I, I think that in so
me wa ys we we re also fort u nate 
wit h th e wa y thi ng s  ca me, we re.  
But, whet her we were fortunate
 or smart, I don't know.  
Q: You know, it's interes
ting to me  that you refer,
 you've referred several t i m
es to the concentration 
ca mp and how a w ful it was and yet as  I underst and it,
 you real l y wer e  onl y there a fe w wee ks .  And 
this see ms  t o  be  s uch a ... 

A: You ar e, you ar e ta lki ng of Carrer a(ph)?  

Q: Yes.   

A: But the ghetto in 
Tool chin( ph) was also 
a concentration camp. 
Q: Ah, okay.  Be
cause I wa s. ..  
A: Yes .  We  didn't call it  a conc
entra t ion ca mp, bu
t it was a concentration cam
p.  Only the fact that 
Sa m wa s u s ed in 
a cer tain pr ofession and I was used as hi s 
as sista nt and t hat we wer e  take n e very 
morni ng a nd brought ba c k every e ve ning, ma ybe  
it ma de it a  little easier,
 you know, but it also  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0436  
45 
 
 
made it a little mo re dangerous, 
because every time Sa
m would have made a 
mi stake on one of the 
soldi ers or offi cers , that would ha
ve bee n the end of hi m.
  So, so he was i n ver y bi g danger and I  
call t hat  a concentrati on camp, ev
en though it wa s 
called a ghetto. 
Q: That 's, I guess t hat was maybe 
wha t  wa s confus ing me .  I want to
