H ERBERT KATZKI 
June 2, 1995 
 
Questi on:   I ' d li ke you t o start 
by sta t i ng your  na me, your date  
of birth, where you were born.  
Ans wer:  M y na me is Herbert Katz ki.  I was bor n 
Oct ober 4, 1907 in Eliz abet h, Ne w J ersey.  Most  
people  don't know where Eliza bet h i s, but  ther e 
i s such a place.  I 
come  fr om there.  
Q:  Tell me a little bit about your fa mily and pers
onal background in ter ms 
of -- a religious home, a 
politically ac
tive home.  
A:  Well , le t 's s e e .  I move d fr om Eliza bet h 
to New York, and it was 
in 1917.  We -- it was a  
combi nati on of house hol ds.  I l ost 
my father at t hat ti me, and we 
were going to m
ove in with my 
grandfat her , and he pass e d a way. 
 And so we wer e there along my 
-- my mother with two children 
and her mot her.  And so we had to
 ge t along.  My education was in
 the Ne w Yor k sch o ol syst e m.  I 
we nt to Ne w York Uni versit y, got  
a de gree i n finance, did graduate
 work in economic s.  Went  to 
school at ni ght , worked duri ng the dayti me , vari
ous j obs .  One job, though, t hat I took in 1929, I  
was working in the credit 
department of a 
mercantile fir m.  Working in
 the credit department 
deci ded me on becomi ng a credit ma
n.  And so in school, I studi ed 
cr edi t s and colle c tions .  That  
was t he subj ect of my majo
r and a cc ounting.  
I n 1929, though, I s wit che d  
over fr om t his parti cula r  
fir m and we nt int o the banki ng bu
siness.  As part  of my ba nki ng 
tra i ni ng I  wa s going t o be come a  
banker and a  business ma n.  Went 
int o the Ma nufacture r s Tr us t Comp
any.  I started wor king for the  
Manufacturers Co mp any a few days 
before Black Fri day 
in 1929.  And I  gu
ess that pr obabl y  
influenced my career.  Anyhow, 
I was with the bank until 1936.  
They got looking around to see 
how thi ngs wer e goi ng.  
Some body s uggeste d tha t  I see the J D
C, Joint Distribu
tion Committee, and  
they asked me to come in to do 
a special job that  needed doi ng.  
And in due course I wa s prevaile d 
upon to give  the m one ye ar out of 
my life to do this special job.  
The one year out of
 my life turned 
out t o be about 60 ye ars.  That
 was a very long agr eement .  I wo
rked in t he New York headquart ers 
office of the Joint Dist
ribution Committee. 
 Then until 1939 -- I was th
ere until November.  How 
come?   The wa r be ga n in Se pte mber.  I t  beca me

circumstances will have changed 
in Europe, and 
JDC would need all the 
help it could over in 
Eur ope.  I volunteer ed t o  go over
seas.  I was accepted, 
and I  went over seas.  
And I arr ived over seas 
in Dece mber  1939.  M y fi rst per man
ent job, we thought woul
d be in Paris , t he h
eadquart ers in Paris,  
where I served as t he secretary of the Eur opean Ex
ecutive Council of the JDC 
and did my j ob ther e .  
The head of t he overseas operati ons at that 
ti me wa s a ma n b y the  na me o f Morris Tr op er ,  
T-r-o-p-e-r, who wa
s t he director general of t h
e overseas operation of the 
JDC.  He was joined by a 
ma n by the  na me of Sc hwart z, Dr. J ose ph Sc hwartz, wh
o came  over to Europe 
at that time to join 
Mr. Troper .  Joe Schwart z landed in I t aly, joi ned
 Troper , who wa s going to
 East ern Eur ope , who at  
that time was ma king a visit around in Europe to 
ma ke pla ns wit h the age n
cies with which the JDC 
was cooperating for  the event t hat
 war wo uld  e n sue  an d we  wo uld  b e
 cut off.  Whi le they were 
over seas, war did ensue. 
 While they were traveling around in
 Europe, wa r did come  a long.  That  
wa s in June  1940.  The y were tr ave ling a round. 
 The Ger m ans wer e pr actic
ally knocking on the  
door in Paris.  I was in charge of the offi ce.  It 
wa s the Europea n hea dquarte rs
, I wa s in charge of the  
office at t he ti me .  Aft er ma king dili gent inquir y, 
I  came to the conclusi on t h
at the JDC has to move  
its office .  It  couldn't  re mai n t here .  Havi ng a
rra nge d wit h ot her Je wis h organi zati ons  worki ng i n  
Paris at the time , like 
ORT- HI AS, t he French- Je wis h or ga niz atio
ns and s o on, none of us woul d 
move wit hout advisi ng t he ot hers .  I  ca me to t h
e  conc lusi on on a Sunday 
that we we re goi ng t o  
move out , having cons ul ted with 
the Ameri can Embassy, who at that
 time were following up the 
French, who were ma king up their mi
nds as t o whether t he y wante d to
 get out of Paris or not a nd so  
on.  Deci de d to close up t he offic e and to mo ve ou
t .  That was on Monda y --  it's Monda y -- that was 
on Sunda y.  I gues s that  was on J
une the 8t h or  -- if t hat was 
a Sunda y .  Anyhow, that Sunda y 
around J une , deci de d t o c l ose  the  o
ffic e.  Cl os ed the offi
ce, moved -- intended originally to move to 
Tours .  Coul dn't go to 
Tours beca use  the Fre nch governme nt ha
d decided that the y we re going to 
evac uate fr om Paris to Tours , and the y occ upie d t h
e city to such an extent
 that nobody else would 
be permitted to come in.  In that
 same Sunday, 
when we decided to close 
the office, I had to phone 
the staff to ask them to co
me i nto M o nda y, pr epar e to
 travel out, we'r e leavin
g Paris.  They came in 
Monday t o l eave the offi ce wit h t hei
r  ba ggage  a n d s o on, an
d they we nt over to 
the railroad station.

I came there when I -- as I began to
 s ay, in that Sunday 
I phoned ar ound t o te
ll the other agencies 
we decided to mo
ve to discover that they 
had already left  without tellin
g us.  And th
e JDC was the 
onl y Je wi sh orga niza tion, wel f are organizati on, i n  
Paris, all by ourselves.  
We ll, Dr. Schwartz and 
Mr. Tr oper c a me bac k to Paris on M o nda y.  The r est of 
the st a f f had le ft .  I had kept the office ope n. 
The re were j ust one -- t w o secre t arie s, my sel f a
nd -- no, t hree s ecretari es , mysel f a nd t he n the t wo 
gentl e men who ca me back
.  We cl ose d down the -- clos ed 
down the s hop on Tues day, and the  
Ger ma ns c a me i n on Thursday.  As 
I said, we 've  started out for Tour
s , we coul dn't ge t in, ha d to 
cha nge dire c tions .  We e nde d up i n Bor de a ux.  
We  move d t he J D C hea d quart
ers over to Bor deaux 
--  
Q:  Ca n I interrupt you he
re.  I  have  a  questi on.  
A:  Ye s.   

Q:  Yo u we re in  E ur ope  alrea dy  wh en t here  h a d  
bee n qui te a build up, a nd the  war c ertainl y ha d 

starte d --   

A:  Ye s.   

Q:  --  in Eur ope .  What 
wa s the mood?  Wh at did you 
thi nk was goi ng to happen?   
A:  Th e mood in Paris wa s very confusing at th
e time , bec ause when you walke d down the Cha mp s  
Elysees, you had the impression ther
e  wa s a bs olut e ly not hing goi ng on
, e v erythi ng looked nor mal. 
And you c ouldn't tell by l ooking ar
ound the stre et s that a nyt hi ng was 
happening at all .  And I thi nk 
that up to that point th
e French had t he feeli ng that their ar my
 was  invinci ble, a n
d they were going 
to stop off the Ger mans. Well , it wa s mi s plac ed, 
as you know.  So that -- we ende d up, the n, i n  
Bordeaux.  We moved the offi ce down 
t here.  We sent out the cables 
t o  all the agencies in Eur o pe 
wit h whic h we had bee n  oper ating 
to tell them where our
 ne w office wa s  in Bor dea ux, t o dis cove r  
later on that the center had held 
up t h e ca bles , and none  of the m 
ha d gone out .  They were held up 
by the center, by the military 
people in Bordeaux.  We 
were in Bordeaux (ph) for about four or fi ve  
days.  Gover n ment  in the  meanti me had move d 
down t o Bor d eaux.  The 
Germans knew that, and 
threat ened t o bomb t he city.  As
 a matt er of fact, they did dr
op a couple of bombs around the 
railroad station to let the French 
know that they're still around.  A
nd the French, then
, had sat down 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0337

and said, " A nybody who wa nts to 
l eave Bor deaux, must l eave by mi
dni ght of a cert ain day or you 
can't get out ."  So we wer e there.
  Tr oper, the couple of secretar ies 
and I, Schwartz (p
h),  we  were  in 
Bor de aux.  We deci ded to get out. We ma de the mi dni ght deadli ne, sl
ept  out in the fi elds , just to ge t  
out of Bor de aux.  As a matt er of 
fact, the road were so crowded at 
t hat ti me wit h refugees - - who 
were comi ng down from Belgium 
i nto Fra nce , and fr om Norther n 
Fr anc e goi ng down to Southe r n  
Fra nce -- tha t  the aut o mobile trip t hat nor mal l y t
ook seven hour s fr om Paris to Bordeaux, it took us  
three days to get down there.  The r oads were t h
at  crowde d wi th re fugee s
.  And we ha d har ds hips  
along the road too, ran out of gaso
line and shelt er  and all  th
at sort of thing.  So
 we  decided then to 
get out  of Borde aux.  We di d t hat a nd hea de d 
for Lisbon a nd deci de d 
that the Lisbon was the 
furthest west one could go in Euro
pe to still be in Europ
ean territory, and that's 
the place to have the 
office.  That was all ri ght 
because t he Uni t ed Stat es was not yet  in
 the war.  This was in -- when we  
we nt to Li sbon, tha t  was 
in J une , J uly 1940.  So we didn't go 
to the war un
til December [1941], so it 
was all right for us to stay in Li
s bon, a nd t hat 's whe r e we wer e goin
g to make  our  ne w hea dquarter s. 
I went back to Marseille after the armistice to se
e whether ther e was any work
 that the JDC could do  
wit h the Fre nch- Je wis h populati on,
 especiall y --  particularl y th
e refugees, who were coming down 
there fr om t he north and 
fr om Bel gium.  Deci ded 
that there was work t hat
 t he J D C c oul d do, a nd I  
opened up the o
ffice for the JDC in 
Marseille for unoccu
pied France.    
Q:  I  want  to ba cktra ck a mi nute .  

A:  Yea h.   

Q:  Bec ause I ha ve  a l ot  of questi ons.  In
 1939 and 1940 be fore  
Paris  wa s oc cupi ed --  

A:  Yea h.   

Q:  Where were your efforts 
direct ed?  Wher e wer e the JDC 
-- were  you se ndi ng money int o 
Ger ma n y or --  

A:  No.  Starting with 
1933 with the advent of Hitler, we 
did not send an
y money into Germany. 
We had worked out an arrang
ement with the German Rife nt
raj ung (ph) and the Ger ma n  
Hoopsverine  (ph), whic h were t h
e agencies in Ger many wi th wh
i ch we wor ked, where by t he y  
would collect to the extent that they coul d the co
st of passage for peopl e immi grating to the United 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0337

State s.  The y  woul d c olle ct the m in M arks , a nd we
 woul d buy t heir s t ea ms hip tic kets  for  the doll ars .  
Conse quentl y our dollar s  did not go i nto Ge r man
y, but the counter -val ue of local c urr enc y, whic h  
wa s alr ead y in Ger ma ny ,  wa s ma de a v
ailable t o t he agency 
with whi ch we  operate d.  So i f you a sk 
if we se nt mone y i n, we  did not . 
 We  ope rate d that ki nd of a  tran
s action.  And wh
en Austria was 
over-- office was t he anschl
uss, we did the same th
ing with Austria.  And in due course we even 
worke d out by fi nancial l edgerdomai n to get mone y 
int o Poland.  We didn't  
send money into Poland  
either.  
Q:  Yo u went over with this purpose?  

A:  No, I went over for t he -- I di
dn't go over as a fi nancier.  I we nt
 over as a -- as a generalist , who 
happe ned t o know s o met hing about fi na
nce, but that isn't why I  went ove
r.  I we nt over, as I say, as  
a generalist.   

Q:  Is that what - -  

A:  You a sk what di d we
 do out of Lis bon.  And 
Li sbon, since we we re no
t in the war, and Lisbon 
was neutral, we could stil
l communicate with any of
 t he agenci es with whic
h we  ha d for mall y bee n  
in conta ct with, by phone 
or mai l  or whate ver.  
But of course , by ma il we 
wo uld not have tried t o  
get in t ouch -- or any ot her way -- wi th Ger ma ny, b
eca use anything that  a na me li ke Je wis h, who 

would have  bee n --  tripped us     
       in Germany, and it woul
dn't have gone t hrough a nyhow.  And 
the same thing with Aust
ria.  But with the othe
r countries we could still 
work.  There weren't many 
countries left where the Germans -- 
of course they occupi ed ever ythi
ng.  So that whil e we were at  
liberty to do it, we we
re  r ather  rest rict ed i n what  we c oul d do.  
Q:  Now, bei ng that  
you were in Europe.  
A:  Ye s.   

Q:  You, I a ssume , ha d a  
lot more information ab
out what  wa s alre ady ha ppe ning i n Ger ma n y a nd 
Austria than the people back 
in the United States had.  
A:  The curious thing is this:   People thought that 
since I was i n Lisbon -- back
 in Lisbon in 1943 -- 
that we kne w all about  what was goi ng on with
 the st ori es that wer e
 coming out fr om the 
concentr ation camps, whic
h lat er bec a me known.  We did not  -- I 
di d not know t hat i n Lis bon.  We  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0337  
6 
 
didn't ha ve t hat i n for ma t ion.  The i n for mati on t ha t
 wa s coming out on that
 wa s being sent out by 
Rie gne r fr om Geneva , and it got over to the St at
e De part ment thr ough the 
help of the American 
Missi on in Berne .  And t hey suppre ss
ed it, because they said t hey wa
nte d proof that t h e storie s that  
were coming out were accu
rate, and they were goi
ng to hold up the informa
tion until they got that 
proof.  Well, as you know, 
it t ook mont hs be fore  the stor y fi nally
 wa s rel e ased what  was going on. 
But in Lisbon, we didn't know it, be
cause t he Port uguese paper s certai nly
 di dn't carr y it.  The y di dn't  
know it eithe r .  They ha d no re port e
rs running around loos e, goi ng in
to the camps or something.  So  
we didn't know it.  And only Ri e gner 's r eport
s brought the informati
on out, and they were 
suppressed.  So  the information wasn
't generally known.  So
 we wor ke d t he n.  We  st aye d i n c ont act ,  
which was all right until 
Dec e mber 1941, whe n --  ever yt hing got
 stopped off wh en we  entered the 
war , and the n we wer e  fighti ng w
ith Ger ma ny a nd with Aus t ria, an
d the Italians came in in June 
1941.  And s o we c oul dn't communica te with t he m  
and so on.  We had to fi nd ot her wa ys the n for  
remaining in contact and communi
cating with them.  We 
got in touch with a 
ma n in Switzerland. 
You ma y ha ve hear d his na me , Soudym
iah (ph).  His  na me  ke eps comi ng
 up.  He  lived 
in up in St. 
Gall en in North Switzer land, who wa s presi de nt 
of the central Swi ss we
lfare, Jewish welfar e 
orga niza tion.  And he  agr eed t e mpor
arily to act fo r the JDC in Switzer
land.  He fi nall
y gave up t hat  
position with the Swiss ag
e nc y in order  to de vote all  hi s t i m
e to JDC.  So he became JDC's 
representative in Switzerla
nd.  And i t  tur ned out 
that he was our  del egat e  for  all t he s e countries  
whi ch the JDC it sel f as an American or gani zati o n 
c oul d not  come  in contac
t, which meant that he 
wa s in c on t a c t wit h Hu ng ary, wit h 
Roma nia , and e ven wit h
 Sha nghai, wit h Fra n
ce , oc cupied, a nd s o  
on.  An d he did the things for 
us.  Co mmunication with Soudymiah 
was easy enough by telephone. 
From Li sbon you could talk back 
a nd forth -- you c oul d ta l k to Sw
itzerland.  That 
was all right. 
You jus t  had to be care f ul  about r outi n g the tele phone calls , be c ause i f they cros sed -- going to cr oss  

Fra nce , t hat wa s Ger ma n y.  Do it by 
         ; they were more 
liber al.  And you c oul d ma ke  your  
telephone ca lls that way, and eve n se nd mail that wa
y in Lis b on.  So that 's how we ke pt in touch, 
then, with the countries with whic
h the JDC -- which the 
Unit ed Stat es ulti mat e
ly  was  i n war  with .  
Q:  Whe n you wer e i n Souther n 
Fr anc e in, I  gue ss, 1939, 1940?   

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0337

A:  I  went  th ere --   
Q:  We re t he  re fuge es t he r e?   

A:  Yea h,  s u re.  

Q:  What  wa s that ope rati on ab
out?   What  di d you do ther e?  
 Tell me more about it.  
A:  Wo rking out of France, that 
was strictl y for  France.  The re
fugees who had be en up i n the  
nort her n part  -- it turned out to be the  Ger ma n-oc cupi
ed area -- to the ext ent that t hey coul d, they  

ca me down to the s out he rn part .  Who we re the y ?   The ex- G er mans and the ex- A ustr ians a nd t h e  

ex- other countries wit h  which the Germans -- th
e Ger mans were at war 
-- so they came down 
sout h.  The Bel gia ns c a me  down so
uth, s o there  we re plent y  of re
fugees  in t he unoc cupi ed zone.  
Also came to Marseille the agen
cies with which we 
had been working in 
Paris.  They were 
evacuated the same as
 we were.  They ended up in Marse
ille too.  The office was in Mars
eille       
         
wit h wh ich we wor ked , they were th ere.   Th e Os
e --  you may ha ve hea r d a bout t he m -- O- s-e .  

That's                  .  They were down ther
e.  The agencies wit h  which 
the JDC had oper ated i n Paris 
were over in Marseille, so we just resumed co
ntac t wit h the m.   An d we k n e w ho w t he y op erate d,  
they knew how we  operat
ed.  We wer e back in bus iness  a gai n - -   
Q:  So  what  wer e  yo u a b
l e to do down ther e?   

A:  -- in Marseille.  The assistance which was give
n in the unoccupied zone
 was mainly a cash relief 
assistance program,  becaus
e it was still possible for pe
ople to buy things in the stores and so on.  
And t heir  bi g pr oble m wa s 
that t he y had no jobs, and wha t 
they needed was some  money with 
whi c h to li ve.  And the JDC pr ovi de d that .  Th
e OSE was a medi
cal assi stance organization, and  
they cared for chil dren.  So t hey
 did their job.  They
 had mi sundera t ret ( ph)
 -- installations wher e 
childr en, unaccompanied children 
were.  And they had a me dical pr ogr am.  The HI AS (Hebrew 
I mmi grati on and Shelt eri ng)  -- what  t he HI AS -- 
you know what the HI AS
 -- you know that?  
Q:  Yeah.  Wh at I know is 
that's  sort of a fe w.   
A:  We j ust  ha d to pr ovide --  we j u st ha d t o 
-- we pr ovi ded the m wit h funds s o t hat  the y c oul d 
conti nue ope rating i n the se vari ou
s fi elds whi ch I have just des cri
be d to you.  And 
we wo rke d with  
wel fare organizati ons too.  There was a Jewish 
wel f are orga nizati on i n Lyons , whi c h was pretty  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0337

large.  And the other thi
ng that we did out of Marseille was to
 continue sending 
assistance up to 
Paris .  Of course  we had le ft be hind in Paris  
ther e s o me Je wi sh pe ople  w
ho re mai ned up in Paris  
and kept t h e organiz ati ons goi ng a nd s o on.  
And there was a 
woman who was active in the 
Inter national  Social Ser vi ce, a n
on-J e wis h la dy who use d to tr avel
 bac k a n d fort h bet w een t he t w o 
zones.  And we woul d gi ve her a 
s u m of money, and she would ta ke it 
up wi th her back to Paris. 
And she  would bri ng ba ck t he r epo
rt s from Paris so that  we knew 
what wa s going on up there at  
least and could fol l ow up on t hei
r house hol d and fi nancing arr ange ment s a nd s o on.  And s o that 's  
how we kept in to
uch with Paris.  And so out 
of Marseille we were able to
 keep things on some kind 
of a fairly even keel 
in France.  That went 
along reasonable all right
 until November
 1942.  In 
Nove mber 1942, t he Ger ma n
s ca me down and oc cupi ed
 t he unoc cupied z one 
and s o on.  And t he n  
things became a little 
bit topsy-turvy, because th
e Jewish refugees, they had no particular resource  
to which the y coul d tur n  back on.  And our offi
ce in Marsei lle became pe
ripatetic, because they 
coul dn't a fford bei ng a r ound wit h the  Ger ma ns a n d            looking for J e wish people a nd s o on.  So 
it bec a me pe ripateti c a nd so on.  But t he work c
ontinue d, and during t he 
whole war  pe ri od t he J D C 
progra ms  continued.  Of course 
ther e was problems conn
ected with it.  It di
dn't necessarily wo r k  
s moot hl y, but to the  e xte nt possi bl
e , c o ntinued in both z ones.   
Q:  Did you get at  all involve d 
with the French-Jewish 
re sist ance?   Di d you give the m a ny kind of 
assist anc e?   
A:  Wh en I left  Germany 
-- when I left France, I cam
e on home leave -- I left
 Marseille in the end of 
Septe mber, I  think, or be ginnin
g of October of 1941 for some  ho
me  lea ve.  And 
I was  on my  wa y 
back to Lisbon when we
 entered the war.  My 
assistant, who remained
 in Marseille, who was 
Fre nch, he t ook over the
n, when I c o uldn't go ba ck.  It subse que
ntly de ve lope d that this assi stant 
was active in the Jewish 
Ar my of Res i sta nce .  We  di dn't kno
w it at the time -- extracurricula r 
activit y.  And we di dn't know t hat
 until he left  France an
d came down to Barcelon
a .  So that  i f you 
ask wer e we in contact with the r e
sist ance , s ure, we wer e.  As a ma tte
r of fact one of t h e things t hat  

we fi na nce d in Fr anc e  wa s the 
-- we helped the local organizati
on -- we di dn't do it our s elves .  We  
didn't work in our own name in 
France.  We worked through lo
cal organizations, which as you 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0337

know is a matter of policy of th
e JDC.  We wor ked t hrough local
 or ga ni zations.  And one of the  
orga niza tions with whic h we worke d ha d a  busi ne
ss  of pr oviding fal se do
cume nts  through Je wis h  
people.  As a matter of fact
, I'm told -- I didn
't know this until la
ter -- I'm told that 
these things were 
printe d at t he  offi ce of t he    
           
 .  But t hey wor k ed wit h our  mone y.  
Q:  Yo u worked with organizations, 
were t hey J ewi sh organi zati ons?   
A:  Je wi sh orga niza tions, yes .  The y wor ke d w
ith our money.  Most of
 the agenci es, Jewis h  
agencies, i n France were worki
ng wi th our mone y.  We  might no
t have had our  own per sonne l  
there , but -- you see , one 
of the advant ages that JDC has --  we 
have be en i n  busi ne ss for  a long ti me .  
We  started in 1914 w
ith this first shipment to 
Pal e stine .  We l earne d s o me
thing fr om the first war. 
And the first war wa s that we should do things  in
 our own na me , but  to wo
rk through indigenous 
orga niza tions.  Be cause i f we  do thi n gs i n our 
own na me  with our own pe
rsonnel , the day we pul l  
out - -  a nd we thought we  we re te
mporary -- the day we pull out w
oul d be t he day the  a gency woul d 
colla pse .  The work would collapse.  So we deve
loped local  orga nizati o ns in all the  count ries in 
whi ch we operate, a nd we always worked t hrough th
e m.  And our a dva nta g es 
that we had that when 
the JDC was not present, they kn
ew enough about what 
the  J D C --  how i t  operate d a nd what it s  
desir es were  and so on t hat the y wer e able to function 
           without 
our actuall y be ing there , but  
they carri ed on.  And t hat 's wh
at kept t he J D C goi ng.  "J DC" qu
ote, unquote had all of the se  
countries in Europe from
 whi c h t he J D C ha d no direct c ont ac t,
 but the y kne w enough about what  
they ha d le a r ned from us , whic h we had lear ned af
ter the first Worl d War to
 keep on goi ng.  And 
there was al ways some em
bryoni c J D C ar ound i n the countri es of 
Europe  that kee p things going.  
And so t hat 's how the work contin
ue d in Fr anc e for t he 
re fugees a nd ke pt  on that  way, I gue ss , in 
1944, when our Paris office wa s reope
ne d, whe n Paris wa s liberated.  
We we nt bac k to Paris again 
on t he s a me pre mis es which we ha d, whi ch we ha d clos
e d up i n June 1940, we nt ri ght back i nto the  
same premises.   
Q:  Now, you took a little
 bit of a detour befo re
 going back to
 Paris?  
A:  Wh en did I go 
bac k t o Paris?   
Q:  Didn't you go for a while 
t o the War Refugee Board?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0337  
10 
 
A:  Yeah.  We ll, I we nt back --  
Q:  Or  that was afterwards?  

A:  No, no.  I 'll te ll you.  
So I we nt on home  le ave ,  
as I  tol d you, i n 1941.  
I  was on my wa y bac k t o  
Marseille when we went into th
e war, and we were 
-- there was so -- little 
uncertainty that the  
Ger ma ns  we re co min g d own i nto  P o rtugal  th at 
our Ne w York office se nt  their message over to 
Lisbon, al l t he Ameri cans 
ha d c o me home .  So I  l a nded i n Li
s bon on Monday, a nd on Friday I was  
on back t o the States.  And it took 
me a good c oupl e of months be for e
 I coul d ha ve per mi ssion to go 
back to Lisbon again.  I wa
s in Lisbon there until th
e end of 1943, when I en
tered the army
.  But my  
military service was on De
tached Service as a speci
al attache (ph) to th
e American Embassy in  
Ankar a, Tur key, which I  did as  an
 ar my ma n.  And t hat  was for 
t he War Refugee Board, when I  
we nt bac k to Turkey.  
Turkey was a n area thr ough whic h ther e  could have bee n -- and t o a certain 
extent there was -- mo
ve me nt of re fugees to Pa
lestine.  The people w
ho were comi ng out fro m 
Hungary, from Pola nd woul d come ou
t via Var na ,  whi ch is i n Bul gari a or via Consta nt a, whic h is i n 
Roma ni a.  They woul d c o me out 
by boat down t hrough the Blac k Se
a a s far as I sta nbul a nd t he n 
over land to Palestine.  I was atta
ched to the embassy in Ankara, bu
t I was stationed in Istanbul for 
the War Refugee Board.  And that 
wa s part of my j ob in c onnect
ion with this movement going 
through.  The work for  the re fugee s in Ista nbul
 was di vi de d in thre e wa ys .  Ther e wer e  three  
agencies i nvolved.  The Jewi sh ag
enc y was the r e t o control -- t o ha ve so me thing to sa y about pe opl e 
goi ng to Pal estine a nd is suing certi
fi cates for that pur pose.  There 
wa s anot her gr oup of indivi duals  
fr om Palestine stationed in Is
tanbul representing th
e different political pa
rties           that the Mossad 
-- you pr oba bly ha ve hea r d.  The Mossad s poke n about,
 they wer e the Mossad.  They wer e there .  

So you ha d the Je wi sh a gency doi ng the tec hni
c al work.  You had t he Moss ad organizi ng t hes e  
transports.  The JDC was there. 
 They di d the fi nancial work. 
 The Wa r Re fugee Board di d t he  
political work.  Wh at 
was their political work?  Th
e Turks would not give tran
sit visas to anybody.  
In order to get through to Palest
i ne, you ha d t o go via  Turkey.  Tu
rkey wouldn't let them through. 
Why wouldn't they let them through?
  Bec ause t he Briti sh woul dn't le
t them into Pale
sti n e, no plac e 
to go.  So there ha d t o be  disc
ussi ons and ne gotia ti ons and one thin
g or anot her with the Briti sh a nd  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0337

with the Turks.  That was War 
Re fugee Boar d business .  And fi na
lly the Turks agreed to give a 
transit visa t o any re fuge e who c
oul d put hi s foot on Tur kis h s oil.  
So t he j ob was t o ge t the pe opl e  
to Turkey.  So they got them to Turkey.  They ca
me fr om Ubea (ph) , whi ch is
 an island off Gr eece. 
They came across, and th
ey landed in Ismea. 
 They came by boat fr
om Consta nta  and Varna  
through the Black Sea 
t o  Istanbul , a n d a c ouple of trans port s 
e ven ca me t hr ough by tr ai n to I stanbul. 
And si nce t h ey got their foot on Turke y soil , the y 
got transit visas -- the plac
e agreed to let them in , 
and s o the y -- I don't know, abou
t 9,000, 10,000, something like that
 -- got into Pale
stine that way 
through the -- it was an effort of
 the Wa r Refugee Board and the po
litical angle.  When I fi nished  
with the job in Turkey 
-- beca use  you re me mber Bu
lgari a and Romani a tur ned
 around in
 1944 and 
entere d t he  war  on our  s i de --  th
ey didn't nee d t h e Wa
r Re fugee Bo ard anymore in Turkey.  An d I 
wa s rea ssi gned t o the miss
ion in Berne, Switzerland
 for  the War Refugee Boar
d.  I  was statione d i n  
Ge neva.  What wa s my j ob t here  
for  t he War Refugee Bo
ar d?  There was a gr
oup of Hungari ans -- I  
don't know, about t hre e or four hundre d Hu
ngari ans -- who wer e  ad
mitted under certa i n 
circums tanc es, per mitt ed to lea ve Budapest a nd e nde
d up in Berge n- Bels e n.  And we t r ied to pre vail 
upon the Swiss to let them come in
 to Switzerland instead of sittin
g up in Bergen-Belsen.  And we 
gave t he Swiss a guar antee that 
at the earliest moment, if they
 would let these people int o  
Switzerland, we will evacua
te them.  So we worked that one out
, and they had these three or fo ur 
hundre d people c a me down fro m Be
r gen- B elsen, and they l anded in
 Switzerland.  
And then it was 
my job to get them out of
 Switze r land, a nd I ha d to
 do that  through t he ar
my  and field telephones, 
all ki nds of t hings.  An
yhow, t he y got  out  of Swit z erland,
 and t hey went 
to Palestine.  
Q:  Wh en you say "got them 
out," can you tell me a little bit 
more about how you did that?  
A:  Yes .  Fo r insta nce , when we got t he m o ut -- 
t he ar my controlle d the t r ans port ation.  Anything 
that moved - -  that  invol ved tr ans por ta tion ha d t o do
 through the army .  So 
I  woul d go fr om Ge neva  
into France, where there was an 
ar my host on their fiel d te lephon
e, to get through via the fi eld 
telephone fr om Annacey thro
ugh Lyons, fr om Lyons to 
Paris, to talk to the tr
ansport people in Paris .  
The t r anspor t people fr om Paris 
moved.  They move d from Paris to
 Re hon (ph).  Th
at 's where the 
treaty was signed, the p
eace was si gned.  So t h en 
anot her operati on I had t o go thr ough t o get  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0337  
12 
 
through Lyons -- aft er t h
e ar mistice, t hey moved 
t o Ger ma n y, and the y ended up in the  Arc hi fa ven 
(ph) building in Frankf
urt, had to get through to 
Frankfurt.  All this by te
lephone, the fi eld telephone 
and s o on.  Anyhow, t ha t 's how I got  the m out , by 
worki ng it  out wi th the  ar
my transport that they  
would take t he m, bec aus e the y ha
d t o go by boat  through the  Medit erra ne an -- by la nd you c oul d 
get them to Italy.  They 
we nt down by trai n -- Ita l
y, but t hey di dn't c ontr ol 
t he boa ts.  The boats , you 
had to do that through the army . 
 So that 's  how t hey -- how thi s 
partic ular  gr oup wa s mo ved out.  
Q:  Wh at time period 
a re t alking about  here?   
A:  Swiss trains.  

Q:  Wh at time period?  

A:  This wa s in 19 -- 
1945.  I  would s ay about  
July or August 1945.  
Q:  So I j ust  wa nt t o ask you
 questions fo r my  own clarity.  
A:  Yea h.   

Q:  You start ed wit h t he Wa r Refugee Board --  

A:  Yeah , th en wh en t he  war  was 
over, I got  out  of the ar my .  Wh
en I got out of the army, that 
released me fr om t he Wa
r Re fuge e Board.  So t ha t  ende d 
up t he War Re fugee Boar d job, whic h I  
told you started in February 1944
, and it landed until I 
got out of the army  in
 October 1945.  That 
fi nished me wit h the War  
Re fuge e Board, t hat fini she d me wit h th
e ar my.  I we nt bac k t o the J D C.  I  
went back overseas agai n.  

Q:  Okay.  Back to the War
 Re fugee Bo ard.  Ho w large 
of an operati o
n was this?  
A:  Wh at wi th th e Wa r Re
fugee Boards?  We had --  there wer e 
exactly four people
 in this dembo 
(ph) in Tur k ey.  It wa s Ira Hirsc h ma n (ph), who 
was the chi e f of mission.
  There was mysel f, two 
secret aries.  That was the whol
e War Refugee Board in Turkey.  
And we worked t h
rough everybody 
else, t hrough the Jewi sh agency, w
ith the Joint ( p h), e ver ybody we 
worked through.  But that wa s 
our  job.  

Q:  Did you wo rk with other U.
S. or ganizati ons li ke t he  St ate 
De part me nt  or t he OSS or --  
A:  Yea h, ye ah.  The  War  Re fugee 
Board consisted of thre
e people wit h t he secret aries, t he tr easury ,  
whi ch was Morgent hau.  There was 
Secr etar y Sti ms on.  I  thi n k he  
was wa r.  An d I t hi nk Hull was  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0337  
13 
 
Secr etar y of State.  Anyhow, t her e wer e three 
Secr etaries of St ate wit h
 the Wa r Re
fugee Board 
responsible directl y to t h e Presiden
t .  So we we re i n th
at channel wit h the War 
Refu gee Board.  That 
wa s our c ontact, that wa s the bac ki n g that we ha
d.  And t h en in conse que nce of t h at, we we re 
practi cally unique, bec ause we had per mi ssi on t o  d
eal wit h the enemy t hat  
wa s going t o be of a ny  
way t o help the refugees.  So 
we were entitled -- normally Americ
an citi zens could do that.  We  
wer e authori zed t o deal wit h the 
e ne my in or der t o do what we ha d t o do t o res cue  pe ople.  The Wa r  
Re fugee Boa r d, they had a repre sent at i ve in Stock
hol m.  That was Iva Olse
n (ph) , who had worke d 
out t he  de al wit h Ra ul Wallenber g, who ended up in 
Buda pes t .  You've  he ard of Ra ul Wa llenber g.  
The  Wa r Re fuge e Board had a  repr ese ntative i n Lis bon
, the y ha d one  in London
.  That was about it.  
Q:  Did you --  

A:  We  did the work -- what?  

Q:  Did you have the sup
port  you ne e ded fro m t he  St ate Depar t me nt i n war --  
A:  Ye s.   

Q:  You ha d what you ne ede d?   

A:  The War Ref-- well, as fa
r as  we wer e c onc erne d, out in
 t he fie l d, our c ont act was t h e  
headquarter s  of the War  Refugee 
Board i n Wa shi ngt on.  Let t he m 
wor r y what they're goi ng --  but  
they were helpful, b
ecause we had t he three Secret aries of Stat
e, a nd so t he y were hel p ful.  We got  

help from the OWI and others .  We 
had t o have t h at ki nd 
of -- had to have that 
kind of help, because 
we were only a fa cilitating group to
 get things done.  We were de
pendent on other pe
ople.  One of 
the bi g proble ms of the Wa r Re fuge e Board wa s  th
at the governme nt ga ve the m no mone y.  The  
governme nt gave the m mone y, onl y
 enough t o c over t heir admi nist
ra tion expens es.  And the othe r 
requi rements of t he War Refugee Boar
d was paid by the Joint.  You find
 the Joint all ov
er the place.  
We wer e  pa id by J D C.  For inst anc e , exa mple ,
 Ra ul Walle nberg -- you know what  he did in  
Buda pest wi th our mone y.  J D C 
was our mone y.  JDC wa
s hel ping me, Wa r Re fuge e Board.  I was  
wearing that hat at that 
time.  But the JDC was all 
ove r the pl a ce.  They we re
 ver y helpf ul.  In any 
event, t hen I went back 
overseas, then, to JDC.  
And when I went bac k ove r
seas , t hen, I  we nt t o th e  
Paris office, because the Arab --  
the Paris office had in the meanti
me t hen retransferred t o Lisbo n  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0337  
14 
 
bac k t o Pari s a fte r it  was  possi ble fo
r  us  to go ba ck up the re.  I go
t back to Paris in
 December '45, 
was there for  a coupl e of weeks when
 I ha d to go i nto Ge r many to r elie
ve J ake Trobe ( p h).  I  thi nk I  
told you about t hat i nsi de  be fore .  Ja ke Tr obe (
ph) , who was i n  cha rge  of our office  -- our oper ation 
-- in Ger ma n y, he got mi xed up wit h this -- t he Gene
ral Morgan incident -- 
and he wa s  wit hdra w n. 
And I  we nt i n t o ta ke  ove r  the  Ger ma n oper ation fro
m hi m.   T hat 's w hat g ot 
me  up t o Erol son ( ph) , 
and got me  --  
Q:  Okay.  But you need to tell 
me about thi s, because peopl e ma y 
not have seen t he other part s of 
these i ntervi ews.  So I ne ed you 
to tell me when we're talking a
bout, whe n you en
de d up goi ng ba ck 
to Pari s a nd how you got  up to
 Er ols o n a nd whe n t hat wa
s - -  j u st very bri e fl y.  
A:  Well, I got back to Paris in 
Dece mber 1945.  I would li ke t o 
make a bre ak to tell you somet hi ng  
else.  I n 1943 whe n I  we nt bac k 
t o Lisbon, after a gr eat deal of 
effort  the Unit ed
 State s fi nall y  
agree d t o a c cept 5,000 - -  
5,000, it was 10,000 --  Je wis h re fug
ee chil dren in t he Unit ed States for 
sa fekeeping duri ng the  war , t he sa
me  way as  t hey ha d per mitt ed t h
e Englis h t o c o me  over her e. 
You re me mber whe n the Englis h ca me i n.  The y agre
ed to take them into 
the Unit ed States.  An d 
one  of the  t hings I  was  su
pposed to do whe n I we nt bac k t o Li
sb on  wa s d o s o me  wo rk wit h t his  
proje ct.  I we nt back wit h an
ot her  JDC me mber, t he na me is So
e boe  (ph) .  And there was an 
Ameri can agency invol ved in t hat
, Ger man- Je wis h Chil dren Agenc y, 
I think it was.  So then we 
went up to -- the effort was made 
wit h the Fre nc h  to gi ve e xit per mits t o t h e pe ople t o l eave Fra nce 

who had come out from 
the un occupied zone, leave Fr ance -- 
for me r  unoc cupied z one .  La va l  
refused it.  And Laval wouldn't let them out, and so the thing fell th
r ough.  So they c oul dn't get t h e  
kids out .  And the kids t hat we did bring out wer e
 kids who wer e alrea dy out, eit her i n Spain or i n 
Port ugal or t hos e c hildr e n who wi
t h t heir pare nts  wer e s muggl ed over  the bor der fr om Fra nce i nt o 
Spa i n, so ac quire d a couple of ki ds.  Inste ad of 
ha ving the 5,000, we only got about 2- , 300.  That 's  
all, be cause Laval put hi s foot down on it.  So tha t 's
 o ne e f for t  we made wi th
 the refugee -- to help 
refugees , and dis covere d  then it didn't pan out .  So 
then I went back t o Paris, then, and took over  

there fr om J ake Tr obe (ph) in Ge
r ma ny.  And in order t o get bac k 
into Ge r ma ny -- t he y ran a ve ry 
tight  operati on.  The ar
my, of cours e, wa s re sponsibl e; t he Am
eri can ar my for th
e Ameri can zone, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0337  
15 
 
the British army fo r 
the British zone, et cetera.  
And they were responsible 
for everything
 that went 
on in their particular zones.  
Responsibility for the American ar
my in the American zone, keep 
peace and quiet and so on.
  And while technically 
t hey wer e responsi bl e 
for the welfare of the  
people in t h e zone whic h they occ u pied, the y s a
id in e f fe ct , " We 'r e sol diers , we 'r e not wel far e 
worker s."  And t hey ga ve  the j ob 
t o the UNRRA a s a s ubc ont ra ctor, so
 to speak, to provi de care for  
the r e fugees and the displ aced pe
rsons who were 
i n  Ger many.  
Q:  I ' m sorr y to inte rrupt you
, but you we nt bac k, t hen, t o
 Pari s in Nove mber  '45?   
A:  Yea h, I we nt in Nov e mber -- 
De ce mber '45, yea h.  I le ft in 
Nove mbe r, ye ah.  And the n went  
bac k to Par i s in 1945.  I  wa s in 
Pari s for a coupl e of we
eks , and t he n we re se nt up to Ger ma n y to 
take  over from Ja ke Tr obe (ph), 
who wa s re assi gned.  
How do you get  int o  
Ger ma ny?   Ar my ha d  
subcontracted to UNRRA to
 provi de  ba sic care  a nd maint ena nce 
for the refugees .  The JDC was -- 
in order to get in, we had to
 come in under the  umbrella , 
t hen, of UNRRA. 
 And UNRRA™s 
headquarters at that time were in
 Herxt (ph), which is outside of Fr
ankfurt in Ger man
y.  A couple of 
weeks after I arrived in Herxt 
(ph) t hen, UNRRA™s entir e headqua
rt ers oper ation was se nt up t o  
Erol son (ph)  and s o on. 
 Since I was at JDC hea d quart ers -- a nd 
at JDC headquarters, I was attached 
to UNRRA™ s he adquar t e r s -- t he offi ce had t o mo ve up
 to Erol son (ph) too, so that the headquart ers 
for the oper ation i n Ger ma ny was i n Erol son (ph)
.  Headquarters for t h e 
Ameri can zone was in 
Muni ch.  Headquart ers for the Briti
sh zone was in Ber gen- Bel sen.
  Berlin was 
Ber lin, a nd the  
Fre nch z one  was in -- oh, shoot -- I  for get th
e na me -- around Const anc
e some plac e.  I don't  
re me mber the na me .  Anyho
w, and so the wor k t hat I  di d in 
Ger ma n y was to tra vel around the  
offices to try to things going along smoothly.  
The JDC -- I mentioned this
 before, I guess -- ran a 
rather dece nt ralize d oper a tion.  The J D C procee ded 
on the ferry to trust the 
me n in the  fiel d, wher e 
the men were sent 
out to the field a
nd certainly given 
the responsibility 
for maintaining a 
country-wide operation.  He was car
efully sele ct ed, beca us e he ha d to make decisi ons on t he s pot , 
coul dn't go t o Pa ris e ver y ti me.  He had t o make
 a deci sion.  Ti mes were
 cha ngi ng t oo quic kly, and 
Paris c oul dn't know the local conditi ons as well 
as the men on the s pot .  He had to make the

wit h s o me kind of gui da nce , you 
know, how their programs
 were goi ng and s o 
on.  And I did that  
for about a year , when we deci de
d to decent r ali ze furt her .  Henc
e, havi ng a cent r al  office for  
Ger ma n y, we ha d the z one s, Munic
h, Bel sen; r eport  dire ctl y to Pa
ri s.  And we eliminated the 
overall office for Germa ny itsel f.  Be
rlin, I t hink, at that 
ti me  hea ded i nto Muni
ch.  And that was a n  
oper ation which we did for the re f
ugees, for the displ ace d pe rsons. 
 And did our wor k, wha t ever i t  
was, t o feed the peopl e,
 to cl othe the  pe ople . 
 Ac tually, t he UNRRA, the y  ha d the re s ponsibi lity, 
then, for t he basic feedi n g of the se pe ople , whic h t h
e ar my had subcontract ed 
to them.  But that was 
the limit of their responsibility, to keep the people alive, to give 
them some medical
 help, to give 
the m s helter ,  give t he m s o me cl othi ng.  But t her
e was a plet hora of assi
st ance , whic h 
the people 
requi red, which UNRRA didn't gi ve t he m.  Ther e we r e questions of e duc ati on and ent er t ainme nt --  
good Lor d, anyt hing t ha t  you c oul
d think of, UNRRA di dn't do i t .  
I n a dditi on t o t h at, t he food 
rations, whi c h the re fuge e s got -- the displac ed pers ons got -- was so ve ry low, a nd t he di ets we re so  

monotonous  and s o on.  So the  J D C, to put it very crude
l y, put the fri nge  on the e mbr oider y.  We  
provided all these extra 
amenities that were suppos
ed to make life more be
arable for these people, 
whi ch were ter ms of educations a nd l ecture s.  An
d we had tr a veling e ntert ainer s and le gal ai d a nd 
ever ythi ng t hat was re quired           .  It was n
't  a j ob, we had t o do it .  So
 t hat was the J D C's job for  
all these people.  That i n cluded i m mi gration assi
stance too.  How did we get into the immi gration 
busi nes s?   I wa s on t he t elephone up in Er ols on (
ph) , and I got a telephone  
call from Dr. Schwartz, 
wh o was the  hea d o f t he wh
ole overs eas opera tion -- tele phoned th
e -- from Pari s to 
a s k me to get i n  
touc h wit h our re pres ent atives  in 
Stuttgart, that she should help
 a certain woman to i mmi grate - -  
some pr obl e m and some  paper s or s o methi ng.  An
d so I sai d to Dr . Sc hwart z, " Why come to us ?  
We 're not i n  the i m migra tion busi ne
s s ."  And Dr. Schwartz sa i d to 
me ye s, we ar e, begi nni ng now. 
And that was of the i
mmigration business.   
Q:  No w, was that in '4 6?  

A:  That wa s in '4 6.  We had been i n the i m migration bus iness be
fore t hat.  Wh en we were i n 
Lis bon, t her e wa s these  people who were c o mi
ng down fr om Ger ma n y 
and Austr i a and ot her 
countries.  Now, the HIAS
 was oper a t i ng i n Li sbon too at tha t  
ti me .  But t h e HI AS, t he y operate d

with individual cases.  If a relative in New Yo
rk or Kenosha, Wi sconsin 
came to them and said I 
have a relati ve, s o a nd s o, ca n you help the m ge
t  out.  And the HI AS woul
d say give us the mone y 
for t he tr ansportat ion, et  ceter a, et cetera.  And 
then the y woul d wor k on 
the ca se .  We  c oul dn't  
afford that l uxury.  We  were in
 the wh olesale business, because as
 I explained t o 
you be fore, the 
Hoofs veri ne  (ph)  and t h e Ri feser i ne  (ph)  and s o  
on i n Ger m any se nt all their c ase s down t o us,  
beca use we wer e pa ying their tra n
s portation as I e xplai ne d.  So cons
eque ntl y, we woul d have to buy 
all the passages on a ship in or
der to make room for 
these people wh o were 
comi ng down.  So while 
the HIAS, they were in the retail 
busi ness, we wer e in t he wholesal
e busine ss.  But we wer e in t he  
wholesale business because Lisbon wa
s the only port in Europe for wh
ich people could sail.  All the 
other port s wer e occ upi ed by t he Ger mans --  or I 
take that bac k.  Spain had some ports too that  
wer e ope n.  But  Lis bon wa s t he ma i n port .

Q:  You were talking about th
e fact  that the Jewish --  
A:  Yea h,  we were  in  
the whol esal e business.  
Q:  Whol esa l e i m mi grati on business .  
A:  Yeah , s o  we  -- wh en I said  
Dr. Schwartz sai d we are now i n 
the immi gration business, we were  
in it  be fore , but  on a  di ff erent  le vel.  

Q:  Wh at ot her -- how else
 do you see the sc
ope of your operation?  Wh at
 ot her kinds of aid did you 
give?   

A:  Did  J D C  gi ve?   

Q:  Ye s.   

A:  To characterize t he work t hat 
we  do, we do e veryt hing fr om pr
enat al care t o car e for the aged. 
We  don't quite bury them, but ev
erything in between we  do, with
 t he pr enatal  car e and postnat al  
care, kinder gartens, educations -- public l eve
l education.  Ted me nti
one d to you about t he  
scholars hip for the uni ver sity st udents .  The wor k 
that we're doing now i n  
additi on t o care for the  
aged -- in Israel , for example, we
 have traini ng progra ms  for pr
i nci pal s of the mi nistries and 
municipalities to try 
to give them some notions 
as to how they mi
ght improve the serv
ices that they 
give .  

Q:  But back -- actually, I really
 need to focus a little bit back 
on the postwar year
s in Europe.  
A:  Oh, ye ah.  We ll, wit h
 the -- well, that
 was about the work that c
oul d be done i n Ger ma ny fro m  
the cra dle t o the gr ave , but you know, the pe ople 
who s urvi ve d what the y 
ha d gone t hrough, I t hink 
that t here was a princi ple of natural selection that wa
s invol ve d, a nd the  pe ople  who ca me  thr ough ,  
ma na ged to come t hrough.  
So that what we ha d to do did not 
have to be gr ound down so finely. 
The  br oa der ,  si mpl er t hi ngs  we didn't ha ve t o do. 
 So ma ny of the things 
that  we would do in a  
country, as I say -- lik
e I srael which i s much furt
her a dva nce d.  So t hat 's  what we  di d i n Isr ael , wa s  
supply -- we had this big 
supply pr ogr a m going - -  
Q:  In Isra el or in Eur ope ?   You 
j ust s aid Isr ael.  Do you mea n i n 
Isra el or i n  Eur ope are you talki ng 
about?

A:  I ' m bac k in Eu
r ope a g ain, yeah.  
Q:  Okay.  Thank you.  
A:  With the  suppl y progra m, what
 we di d.  We had a  represe ntativ
e up i n  St ockhol m.  We had a  
repre sent ative up in Copenhage n a nd anot her one  
in Osl o.  And at  leas t one c oul d buy food and 
other t hings in Swe de n, whi c h wer e  not
 a vaila ble  on the           . 
 And s o we bought
 food up t here .  
We bought dairy pr oduct s
 in Cope nhage n and what
ever , and we loade d tr ucks and s ent the m down 
through.  Some  st
opped off i n Bel sen.  Ot hers  
we nt to  Berli n.   T hey  went  
over  as  far a s Bublee  (ph) 
with the food st uff.  They went
 t hrough Kr ogg ( p h), an
d we  l e ft  food, whic
h we  had acquired in 
Stockhol m a nd s o on.  Whe n the s upply line fr om 
t he Unit ed St ates wasn't
 open, we had to be  
cont ent wit h  what we  could get up
 i n the Sca ndi navi an count ries.  
And that went along all right,  
excepting that there 
wa sn't enough of it,
 but we couldn't give a nymore th
an we got in, 
than we coul d  
acquire a nd so on.  Wha t  
else di d we  do?   For t h e educati on si
de we had to pri nt our own books .  
We  had a n e duc ation --  he was  pri nci pal of a s choo
l up in, I think, in Newt on, Massachusett s.  He  

was principal of the school.  
He              to come over to
 the JDC to go overse
as as our educati on 
guy.  So he wa s traveli n g around in Ger ma n y, st opp
ed at one of the camps,
 spoke to one of the 
ladies  who wa s tryi ng t o do s o
me e duc ational work, a te ache r .  
And s he t old hi m wha t  a pr obl e m 
she was ha vi ng.  She didn't  ha ve a 
bl ackboar d, s h e di dn't have  any c hal
k, nothi ng.  What di d he do 
about it?   Where was he goi ng to find a blackboar d?  
 He re me mb ere d t hat  do
wn the r oa d a  pi ece , he  
had pas sed a  building, which had bee n eva cuat ed.  
And all the shades were
 in the wi ndows.  He  
took these green shades 
down, ga ve the m to the 
woma n, whi ch she use d fo
r blac kboa rds.  And he  
we nt ar ound to a  s upply guy in 
the PX and got chalk, 
a nd s h e was bac k i n busi nes s, a nd she  was  
able to teach.  Well, we  had to 
have peopl e who c oul d use  thei r ingenu
ity in that way to make things 
out  of nothi n g.  So it 
wa s that sort  of e duc
ational work that had to be do
ne .  Oh, t her e we re all  s orts  
of thi ngs.  There was the big el
ecti on i n Fr ankfurt a nd Ufumba h (
ph) , wher e the Ger ma ns  had stor ed 
stuff, which had been looted from the private people
, fr om Jewish libraries a
nd things like that.  It 
was all  in there.  
And t he  job was  --  not doi ng 
any good ther e, whatever.  So
 arr ange me nts ha d t o be  
ma de  for  moving t he stuff out a nd di st ributi ng --

stuff which was in the Ufumbah (ph)            
 deposit .  Those are things that came up.  They were  
very hel p ful to pe ople whom we wer e trying to 
s erve a nd what cont ributi ons which t h e JDC c oul d  
ma ke  to wel f are i n genera l.  
Q:  Wh at about help
ing to rebuild religi ous communities?   
A:  Well , we di d that in Ger many 
t o o.  Well , we  did t hat  all over .  
We  did a couple of things.  In 
sever al of t h e countries, t here we
ren't ma ny rabbis, for example.  Th
e ra bbis  had bee n kil l ed off an d 
i mmi grate d.  Yugoslavi a  at
 that ti me had one ra bbi who was in 
Saraje vo.  Stockhol m ha d one rabbi ,  
and he  was  age d.  We  had t o do 
something about that.  
We gave s cholar ships t o tr ai n ra bbi s.  The  
fellow fr om Sweden went over to 
the Uni t ed St ates, a fell ow fr om 
Yugosla via we nt ove r to I srael , a  
fellow fr om -- who was wo
rking in Romani
a, he went to Isr
ael, to help rebuild
 the communities .  
Two things:   First, we 
ha d to train r abbis.  And sec ondly, we 
i mporte d rabbis  on contract basis , who 
wer e will ing to give a ye ar -- or a ye a r  and a hal f 
or two ye ars ,  wha t ever it 
is -- to go into a county 
and do a job.  

Q:  What  about  
in the camps?  
A:  In the camps?  
There wer e rabbis i n the ca
mp s,  wh o were a mo n g the i nt e
rnees -- is t hat the right  
word t o use? -- in the ca
mps it sel f .  And i f  the r e wa s no ra bbi
, there woul d be pe
ople -- men, who 
wer e sufficiently educated in Hebrew that t hey 
could conduct the service.
  And you ma y know, i n  
the J ewish re ligion you don't ha ve t o be or dai ne d t o 
conduct a s ervice .  A l a y per son ca n do t hat t oo.  

And so t hat  was done i n many of
 t he places where there --  in 
the camps, where they needed a 
qua si-reli gious functionar y to run t he servi ces .  
But the  J D C pr ovi ded funds .
  You pr oba bly hea r d a  
story from Tet fear (ph) about 
a mi kva h.  Ther e wa s a que stion 
of a mikva h, whic h ca me up i n  
Vo hre n wal d,  whi c h wa s a ca mp .  A very we ll k n
own, worl d known, Je wis h ra bbi e nde d up in 
Fohre n wald, and he i nsis t ed on having a mi kvah i n
 Vohre n wal d itsel f.  The r e wa s one, but it was n 't  
kos her enough.  He wa nted to make
 his own.  Al l right .  So finally
 a mikvah was buil t for hi m by  
the JDC, but  then t her e was the qu
esti on of water .  You know t he wa
ter has to be rain water, pure -- 
it 's all  de scri bed i n t he Tal mud about  the wat er.  
The r e was no such wa ter .
  J D C st a f f me mb er i n  
Vohrenwald, he went up to the h
ills with a truck, and brought back
 a truck full of snow and melted  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0337  
21 
 
the snow, and the snow wa s pure , 
that was fit for the mi kvah.  So
 the rabbi had his mi kva h and the  
wat er, beca use our guy we nt up int o  the mount ai ns
 a nd brought s now ba ck, but it wa s pur e water . 
You had t o do that s ort of thi ng.  And then i n 
the communities th
e msel ve s there was a busine ss --  
we had t o st art Sunday s chool cla sse s.  We i mporte
d staff from Israel to do 
that sort of thing with 
Sunda y sc hool cla sse s and do thi n
gs for a dul t s, who mi ght ha ve 
for gotte n about  their Je wi s h 
bac kgr ounds  and s o on.  We didn'
t ge t very much mone y for t h e re
buildi ng of the s ynagogues .  We  
felt that that was a resp
onsibility of other people 
to do, and we weren't so 
anxious to put funds into  
bricks a nd mortar when people di
dn't have [e nough] to eat.  Yo u c
oul dn't  fe ed t he m bricks and so  
on.  And s o we didn't do too much 
of that.  But where some thi n g wa
s mobil e, anythi ng t hat a person 
coul d c arry wit h the m, t hat, we wer e inter este d 
in doing.  Health
, they coul d c arry wit h the m ;  
education, t h ey could carr y wit h the m;  vocati ona l tr
aining, he c oul d carry w
ith the m -- good for the  
JDC.  But we didn't i nvol ve oursel ves partic ularl y 
i n the re ha bil itating of the  grave yar ds .  You ca n't  
take t hat wit h you.  And whi l e it ma y have a gr eat
 deal of reli gious signi fic ance , ot her peopl e could  
do t hat.  Fa mil y me mb e r s or p e o ple fr o m th e sa me
 t o wn or somet hing c oul
d do that .  We ha d ot her 
things to do with our funds.  And so then I was in
 Ger ma n y, t h en, for a ye a r  wit h our pr ogra m the r e. 
Then I went back to Paris and unde
rtook other functions there.  For 
awhile I filled in
 a blank in the 
i mmi grati on depart me nt of t he JDC.  The  i m mi gra tio
n, t hat was reall y a t o
ugh business , beca use  --  
as you ha ve hear d -- eve r ybody wa nt
e d to get out .  And you ha d pe ople i n East ern Eur o pe; Pola nd, 
Romania and Hu
ngary, Czechoslovakia. 
 They were all to come to Pa
ris to wait in Paris until they 
coul d get t he i r vis as.  And you k
now the difficulties which existed 
i n getti ng vi sas .  Nobody woul d 
let people in.  Even to come to th
e United St ates, visas were i s sued in
 t he order of pri ori ty of your  
registr ation.  And ac cor d ing t o pr
iorities in Poland, y
ou could have waite d for ei ght years or te n 
years before you had 
                     , because it wa
s all done on a quota basi s.  So ever ybody want ed  
to come down to Pari s.  Paris got all cl ogged up wi
th refugees who were sit
ting ar ound.  Of course , 
we had to maintain them.  
 What were  the y goi ng t o li ve on?   
We  had to maintain
 them while there 
wer e in Paris .  And s o we  had to arra nge for t he m 
t o be held ba ck in t he c
ountries fr om whence they 
ca me and se nt message s bac k to 
Pola nd, Cz echosl ova kia not to let people c o me int o Pa r i s until t hey

are call ed forwar d by us.  Call ed 
for war d meant that t here's t r anspor
tation, there's a ship.  At that  
ti me t he shi ps were all c l ogged up.  The r e were
 no pa sse nger  boats goi ng 
between Europe a nd the  
Uni ted States at that ti me.  When
 I sa y "no," s ure, there wer e -- every onc e i n a while the r e woul d be  
a boat.  And there was a gr
eat deal of compe
tition to get on t
hose boats.  So th
ere were so many 
places t hat we could get .  So we 
had to tell people -- ke
ep them back where they are, keep them out 
of Paris, because the auth
orities in Paris were after 
us, to keep the influx do
wn.  And so 
they had t o  
stay ba ck.  On one occa sion we ha d to take a whol
e boat, the Shohan Newbi t
 (ph) , to send that to 
Australi a.  There were so many Aust r alian vi sa holde
rs that we had to put them all on one boat and 
send the boat down to Au stralia 
to get them down ther e.  And so we were in the immi gration 
business starting -- as I to
ld you -- until 1954.  And 
in 1954, a couple of th
e agencies that were 
involve d wit h i m mi grati on me rged, whi ch inc l uded
 the JDC too.  So that
 t ook us  out  of th e  
i mmi grati on busi nes s and this merge d  organizati o
n, of whi ch t he J D C wa s the pri ncipal  anyhow -- 
at least took it out of our office
 and took the responsibi
lity away fro m us.  An
other operation that we 
had was the Ameri can Joint Reco
nstr uction Foundation.  The foundati on wa s esta blis hed during t he  
wars to help in the establish ment of mo on (ph)
 cooperat ive s  for poor pe ople -- or peopl e who 
couldn't go to the bank.  Banks 
wouldn't necessarily lend to Jews 
or the interest rates were so 
exor bita nt.  So we pr ovi ded capi t al, got t he l ocal  
people t o provi de c apit al, a nd t he se  cooper ative  
banks were establ ished by the Am
erican Joint Reconstruction Foun
dati on, whi ch wer e all ove r t h e  
place , all over Ea ster n Europe, ha
d t hese foundat i ons .  And t hen of
 c our s e, there wer e  people who 
coul dn't eve n pay t he low int erest ra te that was 
being c har ged by the se loc al banks .  So we opene d  
up free loan societ ies and provided 
the capit al for that.  As I said 
be fore , a n ythi ng t hat you t ouc he d,  
the JDC was in t here someho
w or ot her i n tr ying to ma ke li fe  mo
re l i va bl e, t o bri ng peopl e back t o 
nor mal  a s quickly as  
pos s ible and s o on.  
Q:  Wa s t he  pri mar y goal  to bri ng pe ople bac k t o no
r mal, t o s us t ain t he m or  to get t he m move d out?   
A:  Yea h.   

Q:  Whic h was t he pri ma r y 
focus i f there is one?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0337  
23 
 
A:  That's a difficult on
e.  I think it was more important to 
move pe ople out, beca use t h ey could be  
brought back to norm
al in the country to whic
h t hey wer e going.  And 
I would say i f  one had t o  
ma ke a choi ce, whet her  you bri ng pe
ople back to nor mal or move 
the m out, move the m out.  
Although it was difficult to mo ve
 them out if they weren't norm
al.  So whi c h c o me s fir s t, the  
chic ken or  t h e e gg?   It 's  a  di ffic u
lt one  to work on, but  it wa s done.  
Q:  Whe n you arr ive d, when 
you were Erolson (ph) --  
A:  Ye s.   
Q:  -- over se eing that , di d the si
t uati o n you found yoursel
f in, in terms of the nu mbers of refu gees, 
numb ers of people with gr
eat  ne eds, did the  sit uat ion see m overwhel mi ng?   
A:  I don't t h ink that 's a good t er m
 to use .  We kne w that we ha d 
a big j ob.  If you're ove rwhel me d, 
you stay home .  We ha d a big jo
b, but ma ybe t he job got bigger . 
 And you had t o do it, but you  
coul dn't be  ove rwhel m ed.  Ma
ybe you wer e under w he l me d.  
You cert ainl y coul dn't be  
over w hel me d.  The job mi ght ha ve  been c onsi dere d over whel ming.  I  think t here ' s a nua nce  

bet wee n t he  job bei ng over w hel mi ng a nd be ing 
over whel me d by it .  You know?   We were n't  
over w hel me d --   

Q:  But the job was --  

A:  But the job wa
s overwh elming.  
Q:  Ca n you descr i be  that  a bit?   

A:  Look, the J D C had a 
job t o do.  And t here  wa
s n 't  any ques t i on of wei g
hing t hings , c an we do i t  
or can't we do it, do we  ha
ve st a f f or don't we have sta ff, do we
 need that or don't we need t hat , 
wh atever.  Yo u just dug in and di
d it.  No w, that sounds very si
mp le, but to use a vernacular, we 
surr ounde d oursel ves  wit h a  gr oup of 
"can do" people, and th
e y  di d.  We  ha d t o 
do it.  There was no 
choi ce.   

Q:  Wa s the situation some
thing more than you had ev
er  encounter ed before?  
A:  Of cours e I 'd never  e ncount ered it  be fore.  No
body had encountere d i n be for e.  This  wa s t he fir st

field at all; t eachers, for exam
ple.  We had -- the man who ra
n our camp i n Cypr us -- you know 
about t he Cyprus  busi nes s -- he was  a  school  teac her.
  He wasn't a social wo
rker.  But he had social  
insti ncts .  S o we kne w wh at to 
do.  We didn't have the for mal tr
aini ng, but he kne w  wha t  to do,  
social  work.  Pe ople were
 the  wa y t he y wer e  --  
their charact eristics.   
Q:  Do  --   
A:  We ll, I wonder whet her I ca n ta ke  
a time out to go to
 the me n's room.  
Q:  Sure.  

A:  Where was this Joint 
successful?  I would say this:   I think you have to look at it a little bit in  

terms of the time s.  Wh at
 had happened t o t he Jewi
s h people  in Eur ope  was re ally so horri ble .  As  
you think about it, it's in
credible.  You can't even 
talk about it.  How do you
 kill billions
 of people 
just like that?  And I th
ink that stirred up a lot 
of t he younger people and 
some of the older people  
too, who want to do something to 
tr y to -- not ma ke a me nds , beca use we didn't do it - -  but to tr y t o  
do so mething to relieve their plight of people involv
ed a little bit.  And they 
were willing to put in 
their time and their energies to do something about it.
  You had to ha ve c ertain c harac teristic s of the 

indi vidual , I think, to be gin with.  
It had t o be people who wer e inte
rest ed i n doing t hings for othe r  
people .  And whe n t hes e storie s got  out a s t o what
 ha d happe n ed, a dec ent  
fe eling, de ce nt t hinking 
young guy  

would really want to do 
something to try to help straighten th
e world out a little bit.  And so they 
were willing to devote part of th
eir time at least to ma
king a contribut
ion to bettering the lot of some 
people at least.  And              concerns 
on tr ying t h at out let i n t he 
J D C a nd goi ng over se a s and doi ng 
something about it.  And I think 
t hat probabl y motivated
 many people who came
 overseas to wor k  
with us, and I think that that ac
counts fo r the quality 
and level of work whic
h they produced for  
JDC a nd contribute d to our s ucce ss.  And I think th
at the JDC could feel  so
me satisfaction that it  
really did contribute so mething to
 Je wis h li fe.  Whet he
r it 's the fellow who lande d ba ck on hi s fee t  
in Europe or i mmi grate d ove rsea s,
 I think we did a lot to help pe
opl e.  They were in far away

places; Sout h America or elsewher
e.  JDC followed them along and 
di d what it c oul d t o gi ve the m 
some kind of break.  I think peop
le are entitled to a break in life
, and if you can 
do something to 
help them if they didn't 
have a brea k, I thi nk you s hould.  And 
I think that motivated
 a lot of people 
to do what t hey did.  And I thin
k that account s for JDC's success.  And then when you add to t hat  
the personalities in the Un
ited St ates , the la y peopl e, who wer e 
behi nd the J D C a nd 
t he t hought that 
they give to it, they'r e entitled to
 a lot of credit.  Th
ey helped create the 
atmosphere which makes 
people happy to do it .  And t hat 's all one
's asking,             .  I 
don't t hink I have to a dd anyt hing t o 
that.  I think in words of one sylla
ble that would a ccount for J D C's su
ccess that there isn't much t hat  
can still be done, there's always more that can be 
done.  Lots of people, 
they had this tendency, 
when the y l o ok at t he bri ck wall , t he y
 don't  look at  the  bric ks , t hey only
 look at the hole
 in the wall. 
They don't see the accomplish ment s. 
 They only see wh at was undone. 
 They see the hole, they don't 
see the bri c ks.  Every once in a whi l e we sit ba ck and we l ook at the bricks too, a n d you get a  
certai n feeli ng of sati s fa ction out
 of doi ng it , doi ng s o met hing fo
r s o me body else , whatever .  You 
don't get we althy at it , but the  sa
ti s fa ction that you get re mai n s wit h
 you.  I think that t he s ucce ss  
that t he  J D C has  ha d 
acc ounts  for it .
