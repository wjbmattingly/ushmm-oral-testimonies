Question:  This is an interview for the Un
ited States Holocaust Memorial Museum.  My 
name is Leah Woolson, and I am interviewing 
Mrs. Suzanne Coppel.  The date is October 
30th, 2012.  This interview is being co nduct
ed over the phone.  The language of the 
interview is English.
 
Q:   Mrs. Coppel, could you tell me, where 
were you born and what was your name at 
birth?
 
A:   I was born Mannheim, Germany.  And my maiden name was Mann, M-A-N-N.
 
Q:   And how old are you today?
 
A:   I am 79 years old.  I was born on July  3rd, 1933.
 
Q:   Where were your parents born?
 
A:   My father was born in the Rhine re
gion in Germany in a small town  named 
Hannheim. Do you want me to spell that for you?
 
Q:   If you could.
 
A:   H-A-N-N-H-E-I-M.
 
Q:   And wh ere was your mo th er born?
 
A:   My mother was born in East
ern Germany, Leipzig, L-E-I-P-Z-I-G.
 
Q:   And were your grandpar
ents born in Germany as well?
 
A:   Yes, they were born in Germ
any, but I did not know them too well.
 
Q:   Did they  die befo re you were born? 
 
 
A:   They did not die before I was born, bu
t you see, my  parents were married in 1932 
and moved to the city of Mannheim where 
I was born.  And my  grandparents -- my  
maternal grandparents remained
 in Leipzig, Germany, and my  paternal grandmother was 
in the Rhineland in Germany.
 
Q:   So how long had 
your family lived in 
Germany? Do you know?
 
A:   Oh, I believe since -- the only 
thing I know, way back in the 1800s.
 

Q:   Can you tell me a little bit about your 
home life before you ha
d to leave in 1935?  
Can you tell me a little b
it about what life was like?
 
A:   Well, what I rememb er, of course. 
 I was born in  1933, and we left Mannheim, 
Germany, in 1935.  So I was two years old.
  And I don't -- I don't rememb er too mu ch .  
My father was in the shoe busin ess and direct
or of a shoe factory.  My mo ther was a 
homemaker.  And we went for walks.  My da
d carried me on his shoulders. And th at's 
about what I remember
 except that I know at one point we had to move out of our 
apartment because they found out
 we were Jewish and had to
 find another apartment to 
move into.
 
Q:   Can you tell me a little 
bit more about that, 
either from what you 
remember or what 
you've learned, why you 
had to  move out, when  you had to move out?
 
A:   Well, as I said, I w as born in 1933.  That's  when Hitler cam
e to power.  And my 
father was allowed to stay at the factor
y.  He was managing director of a shoe 
manufacturing comp any.  He was allowed to st
ay awhile because he had connections in 
Holland to where the merchandi
se was exported.  And you se
e, his father had fought in 
World War I and never returned.
 
Q:   So did that allo
w him certain privileges?
 
A:   Yes, until 1935 when 
the SS demanded his di
smissal.  And that's when we were 
asked to move out of our ap ar
tment.  And we managed to find another one.  And shortly 
thereafter my father left for Italy, for Milan,
 where he started a business with a gentleman 
that he knew, and my 
mother and I followed.
 
Q:   Do you happen to k
now how you found the apartm
ent in 1935, how you got --
 
A:   No.
 
Q:   -- from one place to another?
 
A:   No.  I think they just -- my parents ju
st went looking and as
king, but that's all I 
know.
 
Q:   And tell me a little bit 
about how your family was firs
t affected by anti-Semitism.  
You started talking about that a little bit with 
your father's dismissal.  Can you elaborate 
on that a little bit?
 
A:   No.  He was just asked to leave.  He sa id that the owner said, 
"I'm sorry.  The SS is 
demanding your dismissal.  We 
don't want any Jews work ing for us." And th at's  about all 
I can remember about that. As 
I said, I was only two years old.
 
Q:   Do you remember anything
 about when your father left?
 

A:   I remember my father leaving.  And 
he left -- I think he 
went to Italy through 
Switzerland.  And then  -- but he often went 
on business trips.  He
 went to Sicily on 
busin ess.  He often -- and to Ho lland. And 
so I guess at  the tim
e, as far as I can 
remember, I just felt, Well, he
's either going to come home -- but we did -- my  mo ther 
said, "We have to leave. They 
don't want us here any mo re.  We're going to  Italy to meet 
Dad in Italy, in Milan."
 
Q:   Do you have any other early
 memo ries of living in Mannheim?
 
A:   Not really, no.  And I haven't been back th ere since.
 
Q:   What do you remember
 about the journey to Italy?
 
A:   Well, I remember my mother and I taki
ng the train.  And I don't even remember 
arriving in Italy, but I just remember pa
rts of times while we were living there.
 
Q:   Can you tell me a little bit about that?
 
A:   Well, my father, as I say, went into bus
iness with this gentlema
n.  And we lived in -- 
we had a very nice apartment.  A nd I alwa
ys reme mb er going down
stairs to see -- the 
manager of the apartment build ing lived down st
airs with his wife, and I always remember 
going down there and ha
ving a few meals.  And my mother
 used to get angry because I 
wouldn't eat at home.  I was a very picky 
eater. And I rememb er having my  tonsils out 
and co ming home, being in bed.  And I rememb
er my  father sitting by the bed, and he 
was crying.  He cried very easy.  He was a 
very sentimental person.
 And then I remember 
lots of walks we took in Milan.  He always
 carried me on his shou
lders.  I remember a 
time being in a sort of a nursery school with a 
nun, and we went on a walk.  They took us 
out to take us somewhere in the city.  I do
n 't r ememb er w h ere. And  th en  my  moth er an d  
father comi ng fo r me and taking me out of 
-- I was being among the other kids. Taking 
me out.  They said, "Come on.  We have to 
go." And that 's about all I reme mb er about 
Milan.
 
Q:   And wh en were you in  Milan?  From 1935?
 
A:   From 1935 to 1939.
 
Q:   Do you remember any an
ti-Semitism in Milan at the time?
 
A:   No.  I just remember my parents 
saying th at -- about Mu
ssolini.  They were 
collecting all the gold from people, even 
their wedding bands.  And so  they bought 
themselves, I think, stainlesssteel wedding bands andhid thei
rs so they wouldn't have to 
give them up.  And I remember th at much.
 
Q:   So how would you characterize your 
childhood up to this 
point, up to 1939?
 

A:   Up to 1939?  Well, I suppose it was fairly
 normal.  That's  when 
we left Italy, when it 
started.
 
Q:   Tell me about how and when you left Italy.
 
A:   Well, in 1939 or in 1938 -- I'm sorry -- a
ll immigrant Jews were asked to leave Italy.  
This is when Mussolini and Hitler became close.  And we didn't k n ow, of course, where 
to go.  And we didn't  want to
 return to  Germany, and we could not obtain affidavits to go 
to the Un ited States.  My parents had cousins 
and distant relatives, but
 they  were bringing 
their own families over, so they couldn't do 
anything for us. So my father, who had 

business acquaintances in Holland still dating ba
ck to when he was 
working in Germany, 
called them, and he procured a position in a sh
oe factory.  So we gave away -- we gave 
up all of wh at we had because we had to l
eave our possessions, mo st of them.  And we 

took the train to Lugano. And there a gen
tleman accompanied us across the border into 

Switzerland.  And in Zurich we
 took a plane  to Amsterda
m via Paris. We arrived in 
Amsterdam and we were denied
 en try because we had German passports wh ich had a big 
J on them.  And they  wanted to send us back 
to Germany, but of course we did not think 
that was a very good  idea, so
 my father did a little persuading.
  And they agreed to let us 
stay overn ight at the airport and we would le
ave the next day.  And from Milan we went 
to Paris, but there is a story in between. We 
were waiting for the plane to leave, and I had 
never seen a plane take off.  Th
is was in Holland, I mean.  
And my father lifted me onto a 
heat register and didn't  realize how hot it wa
s.  He sat me on it a
nd burned my  derriere.  
And I was very badly burned.  But we got 
on the plane. And the 
doctor -- a gentleman 
noticed that I was very uncomfortable sitting,
 so he approached my parents.  And he 
happened  to  be a doctor from ViennA: And he
 and my  parents began a conversation. And 
he apparently told them to go -- the best thin
g was to go to Paris.  He advised my father 

that the situation for the immigrant Jews in 
Milan was bad, not to go back there, and to 
stay in Paris.  And he even suggested a hot
el there where we might stay. And we were 
there for about three weeks and then obtained
 permission to go to  Ca
en, C-A-E-N, for the 
next six months. And now we go to the year of
 1939.  My father joined the French Army, 
and my mother and I stayed in Caen at a hot
el where she was a waitress.  And very soon 
thereafter the Germans occupied
 the city and took over th
e hotel. So my mother was 
supposed to be a Swiss citizen
 because she couldn't speak Fr
ench by that time and could 
only speak German.
 
Q:   Was she posing as a Swiss citi zen?
 
A:   She was posing as a Swiss citizen. And 
she took me aside and 
told me -- warned me 
that if any of the German soldiers approach
ed me and spoke to me, to pretend I didn't 
understand them, to answer them 
in French or Italian. So lo
 and behold, a German soldier 
did approach me and asked "Wie heißen Sie?
"  What is your name, in German. And I 
answered, "Je ne comprends pas ce."  I don't 
understand. And he pe
rsisted, and another 

German soldier joined him. An
d they were talking between 
them about the little girl who 
they left in Germany.  And so after a while they let me g o .  And I was scared to death.
 
Q:   Was this in the hotel in Caen?
 
A:   In the hotel, yes.  They were going -- 
I remember b eing at the bottom of the stairs, 
and the restroom was on the side and th ey we
re going to go in to the restroom and th ey 
happened to see me.
 
Q:   And how old were you at this point?
 
A:   I was six.
 
Q:   So were you already en rolled in school or not yet?
 
A:   No, I was not.  I was not because soon th
ereafter it was time to flee again.  And this 
time we went to Le Mans, France.  That
's capital L-E and then capital M-A-N-S.
 
Q:   And wh at caused you to flee?
 
A:   Well, the German occupation.  We were
 running away from them
.  And we stayed in 
Le Mans until 1940, until the Germans appro
ached and began bomb
ing the city. So I 
guess my father came -- was on furlough from 
the Army, I don't re
memb er wh ich , bu t 
talked to a French citizen 
who accomp anied us across the boarder to  wh at we thought 
was the unoccupied zone.  That was southern
 -- southwestern France, to the village of 
Castelmo ron-sur-Lot. Did you want me to
 spell all these words, these names?
 
Q:   If you can.
 
A:   It's C-A-S-T-E-L-M-O-R-O-N, and th en 
next wo rd is S-U-R, and th e third name -- 
word is Lot, capital L-O-T.
 
Q:   And can you tell me, how did you get 
from one place to another at this point?
 
A:   Walking.  And all of us
 were walking very leisurely. 
 And all of a sudden my  mo ther 
asked me to go down and make pee pee. And 
I responded that I didn't have to. And she 
said again, "Sit down  and make pee pee."  And 
I said, "I don't have to."  And finally she 

slapped me and pushed me down. 
And of course, I started to cry.  I was hurt.  I was -- 
And then later she explained to me that th
e Germans from the occupi
ed zone of France 
were watching us with their binoculars a
nd we were supposed  to make it look like a 

promenade, a leisurely walk, and not an esca
pe. And th en the gentleman who was with us 
led us to the nearest farmhouse.  And I reme
mb er hiding in the shed  wh ere tobacco was 
hanging, hung drying.  And the ne
xt two days we slept in stal
ls and different barns. And I 
remember noises at night.  There were rats a
nd mice.  We had no green card, so we were 
at the mercy of the farmers who did give us 
food and shelter. And we trusted them that 
they wouldn't turn us
 in to the Germans.
 

Q:   Can you tell me fo r a moment what you
 mean by "green card"?  Do you mean a 
special tran sit card?
 
A:   I'm using that as an example.  As we
 have green cards here, it was -- I can 't think -- 
an identification card.  Being noncitiz
ens, we had to ha
ve identification.
 
Q:   So you were walking from one town to  the next?
 
A:   We were walking.  And we continue
d to make our way then to the town of 
Castelmo ron.  And of course, we
 had to find a place to live.  And my  parents did.  It was 
very, very primitive.  The entry 
was just dirt and had wood to
 burn in the fireplace, and 
living quarters were upstairs.  And there 
was just one bedroom and a very primitive 
kitchen with a wood-burning stove and a firepl
ace.  No bathroom, indoor or outdoor.  We 
just used a bucket, which had to be emptied 
every day. And my  pare
nts got jobs.  They 
acquired jobs in a belt factory, doing a
ssembly work.  And then I started school.
 
Q:   When  you started school, did yo
u have to pose as a non-Jewish child?
 
A:   You know, I don't -- we were the onl
y Jews in that little village.  The children 
probably  didn't know, but I'm sure their parents 
knew.  People were very, very  good to  us 
there.  There was never anything that I reme
mb er said from any of the children, anything 
derogatory . And then  in 1940 of course th
e Vichy government came into power, whose 
leader was Marshal Philippe Pétain.  Cap
ital P-E-T-A-I-N. And of course, he -- his 
bosses were the Germans, were the SS, the 
Nazis, even though 
he had fo ught against 
Germany in World War I.  He just turned ar
ound comp letely.  And 
from that time I guess 
until the end of the war, we were hunted.  We
 lived underground most of the time.  Our 
neighbors knew we were refugees. And then
 the next thing I rememb er was that my 
parents told me that they have to leave or 
they were warned befo
rehand by a symp athetic 
official from the police that 
there would be a house-to-hous
e search and that they had 
better flee.
 
Q:   And this was still in Castelmoron?
 
A:   Yes.  Oh, yes. And they left me in 
the care of the French family who owned the 
hotel.  And of course, they didn't  say wh ere 
they were going.  I had no idea where they
 
 were or when and if I would see them ag
ain. So I was sent to Catholic church on 
Sundays and catechism after school
.  They to ld my  parents, "Well, if she can't practice 
her religion, she should have something.  
So  send her to church  and to catechism."
 
Q:   Can you tell me a little bit about 
the family who you were hidden  with?
 
A:   Well, they also owned the factory.  An d of course, they gave my  parents a job.  So  
my parents felt that they should listen to th
em and send me to church. And th ey were 
very, very sympathetic.  Very nice.
 

Q:   And how were you hidden?  Were 
you taken in as part of the family?
 
A:   Yes.  I was like part of the family.  I 
had no problems, except I was very homesick.  I 
didn't  know when  and if my  parents would retu
rn or wh en and if I would even  see them 
again.  It was months before we were reuni
ted. And I guess my  parents had gone to a 
different town where they kne
w a German-Jewish family w
ho owned a farm.  And this 
family had two daughters a little 
b it older than I was. As a matter of fact, they had their 
daughters converted to Catholicis
m so that their lives would be
 saved.  They were -- Both 
girls were baptized.  So they
 went into hiding th ere and I 
stayed with a 
French family.
 
 And wh en I started going to church, my  fa
ther even bought me the New Testment, 
prayer book, and a rosary.  He was not an Orth
odox Jew, but he was fairly tradi tional, so 
that was an unusual thing fo r him to do, bu
t then our lives were in question. So I 
continued attending church and catechism. A
nd th en one day the priest approach ed me 
about baptizing me, and he mentioned that I ne
eded to have a religion.  And I responded, 
I said, "I do have one.  I'm  
Jewish." And he said, "Well, that
's really not a religion, but I 
have to talk to your father, a
nd he's going to have to convert 
first." So he did.  He spoke 
to my  dad.  And my  dad told him, "Father, I'
m very sorry," he said, 
"I'm not a very good 
Jew.  I'd make an even worse Catho
lic."  So that was the end of that.
 
Q:   How did the priest know wh ere your father was?
 
A:   Well, my father was -- my parents were
 back at that time, back from their hiding.
 
Q:   And about what year was that?
 
A:   That was sometime, 1940, I think.  1941 perhaps.  It was a small village.  There was 
one Catholic church, and he was 
the priest in that Catholic c
hurch.  And we lived in that 
village.  So he knew where to find my fathe
r.  And that was before 
my father joined the 
French Undergro und.  And we had no idea wh
ere he was. He mentioned to us after the 
war that their job, the Underground, called the 
French Forces of the 
Interior, their job was 
to blow up German ammunition 
trains.  And he did co me 
home occasionally for a couple 
of days. And then in  late 1940 -- In 1942 my
 parents decided to have another ch ild.  I 
guess it was rumored that the Vichy authorities 
would not arrest a h u
sband of the Jewish 
women who were pregnant.  And 
of course, that was all foolishness.  It wasn 't true. But 
my mother at the time was then
 tw o months pregnant wh en 
the gendarmerie, the French 
police, came to arrest my father.  And I re
member clearly that th
ey took him from the 
house wh ere we lived, had him remove his belt, 
and handed him three sa
fety pins to hold 
up his pants. And I heard them say to my  moth
er, "We don't want him to keep his belt.  
He might hang himself." 
And of course, I started screaming,
 "Please don't take my father 
away."  I was nine years old.  And this is
 an episode which is in my  mind always. And 
the chief of police was very nice to us, very
 symp athetic.  And I don't know what would 
have happen ed if it hadn't been for him.  He 
t o ld  my  mo th er to  ob
tain a letter from the 

town 's only -- one and only doctor, stating that
 she was four months pregnant instead of 
two, and that he would try to have my  father
 released. And she did that.  And she did so.  
And my  father came home a couple of days later.  But from then on, he was a hunted  
man. So my sister and I -- you'll have to fo rg
ive me.  I tend to be 
a little emotional.  My 
sister Annie was born in Villeneuve-sur-Lot 
-- V-I-L-L-E-N-E-U-V-E, 
next word S-U-R, 
and the next word capital L-O-T -- on August 
5th, 1943.  And this was the nearest -- the 
town with the nearest hospital.
  And I was 10 years old and, of course, very excited to 
have a sibling. And then  my  dad was in and ou
t of the woods or wher
ever he was with the 
underground.  He would come home once in a wh
ile.  He left his bicycle at the next-door 
neighbor's back yard.  And our bedroom wind
ow would -- you would go onto  the roof of 

the house and th en you could ju mp  into th e neig hbor's back yard. On  one of his visits in 

the middle of the night, there was a knock on th
e door.  So  he quick ly jump ed  out of the 
bedroom window to  the adjoining yard and to
ok off on his bicycle. The authority -- now, 
this was the French authority.  
I guess they had to do their j
ob, or so they said.  They 
came upstairs -- Oh, and what I ha
ve to preempt this with was 
that they had tried to warn 
us that they had to co me and insp ect the hous
e. And th ey looked all over, under the beds.  

And my  mo ther held  my  two-months-old  baby si
ster and said, "Here, do you want to take 
her too?" So  they mentioned they were under 
the orders of the SS 
and then they left.
 
Q:   Now, was your father back and forth 
from the forest to your
 home through the entire 
period from 1940 to 1943?
 
A:   Yes.
 
Q:   Do  y ou reme mb er h i m co min g  and  go ing?
 
A:   Coming and going, yes.  And I re
me mb er him vividly jump ing out the bedroom 

window and onto th e roof and th en going down
 th e neighbor's  yard on his bike. So I was 

-- every night I laid in my bed and I was terrifi
ed.  I knew that they 
-- that the Germans or 
the Vichy govern ment were picking up the 
Jews in trucks. And when ever I heard a 
vehicle during the night I was just trembling. 
 I was terribly frighte
ned, and I knew they 
usually came in the middle of the night. And th en ab out my  school attendance was of 

course very erratic.  I'd  go to attend class one
 month and then we we
nt into hiding two or 
three months.
 
Q:   Where did you go into hiding?
 
A:   In farms outside the city, the town.  A
nd we had one particular 
farm we alw ays went 
to where we worked.  And my 
-- when my father was not serv
ing with the resistance, he 
worked on one farm while my mo
ther and I and my  sister a
nd on another farm.  And we 
worked in the fields.  We pi
cked  tobacco, tomatoes, potatoes, green bean s.  I milked 
cows.  I took them to pasture and had to 
tend to them so they
 wouldn't stray into 
neighbors' property because there were no 
fences anywhere. And the living conditions 

were also very primitive there.  And no indo
or or outdoor facilities. You just went out in 
the field and that was it. In the morning you
 went to the pump ou
tside and you washed 
face and hands.  And once a week
 my mother would heat wate
r in the fireplace or on the 
wooden stove in the farmhouse and take -- put 
it into galvanized tu b, and that was my  
bath in th e middle of the kitchen.  And that was my  bath.
 
Q:   And so who was hiding you?  Were these local farmers?
 
A:   The farmers.  The farmers.
 
Q:   And you were moving from place to place 
so that your father wouldn't  be found?
 
A:   Well, my father was in a different place.
 
Q:   Okay .
 
A:   Yeah.  And of course, I still rememb
er the chickens, the duc
ks, and the pigs and 
running in and out of the k
itchen throughout the farmhouse. And my poor sister and I 
were infected with lice.  My mother was alwa
ys work ing on our hair with kero sene to get 
rid of the lice.  And rodents were all over 
the place. And the only time I really had any 
fun was during harvest seas
on.  Harvest the grapes.  We were
 in a region that's not too far 
from Bordeaux, wh ich is a wine region.  I'll 
spell it for you.  Capital B-O-R-D-E-A-U-X. 
And then  in a couple of months
 or three months when  we thought it was safe, we would 
return to the village and I would resume school
.  I also -- my husband is reminding me.  
My fun during grape harvest was to get into  
the barrel with the grapes and stomping on 
the grapes.  That was a lot of fun.
 
Q:   Can you tell me ab out what year this 
was that you were going
 from place to place?
 
A:   Well, this was -- we were doing this
 off and on until the end 
of the war in 1945.
 
Q:   So from 1943 or so?
 
A:   From around 1940 to 1945.
 
Q:   Okay .
 
A:   And of course, when I returned to school
 I didn't have a very understanding teacher.  
I had missed a lot.  And she would give a test
.  And of course, I wo
uld get a bad grad e. 
But truthfully, my  father was not very un
derstanding where school
 was concerned.  
Where education was concerned, he was extr
emely strict.  And th
e only slap on the 
derriere I ever got from him was when I brou
ght home a fail grade or a bad grade. And 
oftentimes I would come home from school 
and find my mother 
waiting with the baby 
carriage and off we went to hide again.  
This time my father 
was hiding with th e 
underground. And then the word came that
 th e Allies had landed 
in Normandy.  And 
everyone was excited.  We could hardly rest
rain our emotions.  A
nd my  father and his 

group aided the American troops.  And th
en when he returned
 from one of these 
missions, he'd  bring us powdered  milk and to
othpaste and chocolate and soap . And by the 
way, during the war we had -- everything wa
s rationed.  We had coupons for meat, for 
bread, for everything.  And my 
mo ther used  to make her own soap .  She used to save all 
the grease from -- I don't know wh at.  Save it a
nd use -- and co ok it in the fireplace and 
then it became hard when it cooled.  And th
at was soap. And then the Allies ad vanced 
into our vicinity, and the Germans and Vichy tr
oops left the area and we were able to 
breathe a bit.  And my  father was mu ch deco
rated.  He got the medal of honor.  And he 
got the medal of voluntary firer of the resi
stan ce as well as the commemorative medal 
war with clasp of liberation.
 
CHK)  SEE HIDDEN NOTE ->
 
And by the way, I didn't write th
is in my story.  My father
 was in Who's Who in France 
in a book. And my father was 
discharged from military servic
e in 1946.  And he accepted 
the post of tax inspector in Le Saar, which 
is capital S-A-A-R, which is a region between 
France and Germany. During that
 time, of course, it was occu
pied by the French military, 
and during that time w e 
became French citizens.
 
Q:   Can you tell me a little bit about what liberation was like?
 
A:   Well, everyone was dancing in the str
eets of that -- in Castelmoron, in that little 
village.  It was just unbelievable.  Espe
cially when Dad came 
home and he said we 
survived.  And after this my 
dad was appointed director of 
police for the Saar province. 
And wh en his job was -- ended with that, he 
became a co-owner of a shoe manufacturing 
comp any.  He had met a gentlema n who had 
th e funds, a French gentleman.  And my  
father had th e know-how, so th ey opened th e 
shoe factory. And we at the time, as I 

mentioned before, had relatives 
in  the United States, cousins. 
 And I was really sick and 
tired of war-torn Europe.  And I used to read
 magazines of New York
.  I thought at the 
time that N ew York was -- literally 
the streets were 
lined with gold.
 
Q:   What made you sick and tired of wa
r-torn Europe?  Was it the conditions?  Was it 
the way people  were treating you?
 
A:   The conditions and what we went through.
  And prior to my -- that comes later.  I 
just wanted to go. My parents 
agreed to send me to New York
, to relatives for a year or 
two, wh ere I could study, learn the language, and co me back.
 
Q:   And how old were you?
 
A:   16. Bu t while I was here I me t my  husband whose family had -- my  husband's name 

is Werner, W-E-R-N-E-R. His fa
mily fled from Germany in 19
35.  They were smart. But 
they had relatives here in the United States
.  My husband's father had a sister in 
Pennsylv ania, so they obtained affidavits an
d came in 1935. And my
 husband and I were 

engaged in  1952. That same year he was draf
ted into the Army and was sent to Germany 
where he served in the m
ilitary intelligence in Berlin.
 
Q:   And I want to take you back for just
 a moment. How did you get from Europe to the 
United States?
 
A:   I came on a ship named capital D-E, next 
word is capital G-R-A-S-S-E, with a friend 
of the family.  At the time she was also goi
ng to New York  to vi
sit people. So  I came 
with her.  Sh e sort of looked  after me during the voyage.
 
Q:   Is there anything in particul
ar you rememb er about that journey?
 
A:   The journey?  Yes, I do. 
 It was in April.  And the wa
ters were rough, and most of 
the people on the ship were sick
 except me.  And it was, of c
ourse, we came tourist class.  
In those days those ship s have to urist class, 
second class, first clas
s. Our cabin was next 
to the engine room, I believe.  But it was pleasant.
 
Q:   And can you tell me the first 
thing you rememb er about New York ?
 
A:   New York, I was picked 
up in New Yo rk by a daughter 
of -- a cousin's son and his 
wife.  And this cousin with wh
om I stayed for a while, the firs
t thing she did, took me to 
Woolworths and bought me a Hazel Bishop lips
tick.  You're probably too young to  know 
what Hazel Bishop was, but that was very popular back then. She 
said, "You must wear 
lipstick." My parents were very strict.  I was 
not -- I had to dress -- I had to wear what my 
mother wanted me to wear.  And I was not 
allowed to use any lipstick or anything like 
that.  And I had a fairly strict European upbri
nging.  You were to be 
seen but not heard.  
But I had very loving parents.
 
Q:   And wh ere did you l
earn English in New York?
 
A:   I just learned.  I went to school fo
r a little while until this -- 
the uncle with whom I 
was staying, the cousin, became ill. In betw
een the time, I met my  husband, who was to 
be my  husband.  Of course I was only 16 y
ears old. Nothing -- I said 16.  I was only 16 
years old when I first met him 
through relatives of the relativ
es.  A nd that was that. But 
then the cousin became ill -- 
the cousin with whom I was 
living in New York -- with 
cancer and passed away. And as I said, my
 husband and I reconnected , my  future 
husband and I.  We me t -- we became engaged, 
1952.  And then in 1
954 I went to France 
with my future mother-in-la
w on the Queen Elizabeth I.  
And my  husband and I were 
married in Saarbrücken.  S-
A-A-R-B -- I'll start over.  S-A-A-R-B-R-U-C-K-E-N, in Le 
Saar.  And my husband was still 
in the service at that time. 
 That's why.  And I was due 
for a visit home to my family. So we got marr
ied there.  And then  he was discharged.  
And we lived in Williamsport, PennsylvaniA:
 And we have two wo
nderful sons, Gary 
and Stephen. And after the province -- the Saar
 province was returned to Germany in th e 
1950s -- so my  parents did not 
wish to live in Germany.  So
 my  parents and sister moved 

to Strasbourg, that's S-T-R-A-S-B-O-U-R-G, Fr
ance, where my father became director of 
an import/export rubber distributorship. And my
 father passed away March 11, 1997.  He
 
 was 91.  And he was a very courageous man, 
a man of vision.  Very intelligent.  He was 
always self-taught. You could discuss with 
him any subject under the 
sun. And he always 
no matter how difficult life became, he never ga
ve up.  He was my  mentor, my  hero. And 
my  mo ther passed away Ap ril 30th, 2011, at th
e age of 103.  Sh e re
sided in Strasbourg.  
And my husband and I went to Europe for th
e last 17 years twice a y ear, sometimes three 
times, to see her. And then my sister wa
s married, has one daughter, but she was 
widowed in -- about 11 years ago, in 2001. 
 And sh e resides in An nemasse, A-N-N-E-M-
A-S-S-E, France.  It's near Ge
neva but on the French side. She took care of my  parents all 
those years. My father started with his illness 
in 1997.  And sh e took care of my family.  
And as I said, we made our trip twice a year to  try to help out as best we could. But the 

war left scars, and in 1945 I fell ill with ty
phoid fever and hepatitis.  
And I was fairly sick  
for about a year.  And I have chronic head
aches, migraines, and tend to  suffer from 
depression once in a wh ile. And my  mo ther
 suffered from chronic bronchial problems 

throughout her life.  And my  
mother's family , now, my moth
er had three brothers and one 
sister.  Now, her sister somehow managed 
to escape from Leipzig to London, England. 
And my  maternal grandmother -- my  maternal grandparents and three uncles, my  

mother's brothers -- my mother
s -- pardon me -- yeah, my moth
er's brothers, were sent to 
Auschwitz.  And my father's  mother, his sist
er -- her husband and 
two young boys, ages 
eight and six, were deported to Da
chau and none of them returned.
 
Q:   Do you remember their names?
 
A:   No.  I barely saw them because, as I sa
id, my  parents moved aw ay.  And I don't even 

-- I have pictures.  And my mother -- my moth
er never spoke too mu ch about her family.  
Whether it was too difficult for her, I don't know
.  I think my  grandfather -- her father 
was in the -- was a furrier.  And I remember 
h er saying her mother was always ill and she 
had to take care of her.  Other than  that, I really -- I don't know.  I rememb er seeing them 
once. And my  aunt, my  husband and I went 
to London years ago.  She has -- she passed 
away about 10 years ago.  An
d I met my  aunt.  I have a cousin in  London named Monica 
and a cousin George.
 
Q:   And wh at is your aunt's  name ?
 
A:   You know, at the moment -- I knew it. 
 I can 't think of it.  You must -- I can't 
remember. Monica's mother, do
 you remember her name?  Oh, I know.  Elfreide, E-L-F-
R-E-I-D-E.
 
Q:   And where did they live before the war?
 

A:   Well, before the war she was in Leipzi
g.  And she managed to escape and lived in 
London during the war.  And sh e got married 
in England also to a man from -- whom I 
didn't  know from ViennA:
 
Q:   I want to take you back
 for a moment.  Do 
you rememb er as a ch
ild, either when you 
were in Mannheim or then wh
en  you were in hiding, bei
ng aw are of what was going on 
in Germany or wh at was going on th rough
out the rest of Europe to the Jews?
 
A:   Oh, yes.  Not in Man
nheim and perhaps not in Ital
y, but after.  Very aware.
 
Q:   About when  would you say did y
ou become aware of what was going on?
 
A:   Well, I became aware when I heard the car 
or truck at night.  I must have been eight 
or nine.  And I knew they were taking Je
ws and transporting them to concentration 
camps.  I grew up very fast.
 
Q:   Do you reme mber how you heard abou
t wh at concen tration camp s were?  Did you 
hear your parents speaking about it?
 
A:   Probably my parents, yes.  Uh-hmm.
 
Q:   Do you reme mb er overh earing conversa
tions from your parents or your mo th er 
talking ab out anything in particular during the war?
 
A:   Well, yes.  I remember my mother saying, 
"Well, your father is away."  Of course we 
didn't  know where he was.  She didn't know wher
e he was.  "But we have to" -- and every 
time we had to go into hiding
, I knew that we were hunted
 by the Vichy government or 
the SS.
 
Q:   What sticks out for you the most in
 those mo ments when  you
 were traveling from 
one place to the next, trying to
 stay one step ahead?  Wh
at do you remember the most?
 
A:   I remember the conditions 
under which we lived, having to 
stay quiet.  My sister was 
a baby.  She wasn 't even allowed to cry. An
d by the way, my sist er wouldn't tal k  to 
anyone outside her immediate fa
mily.  Not even to my husba
nd wh en he and I became 
married -- were married. She co
uldn't talk.  I know sh e went
 to a psychiatrist. We're 10 
years apart.  I was already gone.  But she 
had problems.  And it was not until she became 
engaged to  her husband that she really opened 
up. But what sticks out the most to me was 
when  they  came to get my  father and have
 him remove his belt so he wouldn't hang 
himself. And wh at sticks out were the terri
ble -- the big rats r
unning around all over the 
place.  To this day, I'm deathly afraid of th em.  My father would set traps all over when 
he was home.  The noises at night from the ra
ts and the mice and the cars, when there 
were any, and being afraid of
 being taken away and wo rried about would I see my  father 
ever again. I tried to put a lot 
of this in back of my  mind and tried to fo rget it, and yet I 

consider myself very fortunate, I guess, than
ks to my father's visio n .  But through the 
grace of God, we were never in a concentr
ation camp.  And that's very fortunate.
 
Q:   What do you remember 
the most about those people in
 the French countryside who 
you were hiding  with?
 
A:   Well, they were farmers. 
 They tended to their land.  They
 helped us out.  I think they 
were -- they were socialists, may b e tendenc
y towards communism.  So they hated the 
Germans and th ey hated the Vichy governmen
t. And we worked.  We got food and 
lodging, but we did work.  But they took care 
of us, too.  So we're 
very grateful to the 
French people.  They  saved our lives, rea
lly.  And they  saved 
us from deportation and 
death.
 
Q:   And wh at do you reme mb er the mo st 
about your interactions with the French 
gendarmerie while you were there?
 
A:   While I was there, well, I can -- the ca
ptain of the gendarmerie was very, very kind 
to us.  That's what I remembe
r.  He felt very, very so rry for 
us.  And he really tried his 
best, tried to warn us when ever he could.
 
Q:   Tried to warn you about?
 
A:   About "You be careful. 
 We may have to come tomo
rrow night to your house and 
inspect the house," or "Perhaps
 you better flee." They had to
 go through the motions of 
coming and doing th eir job.  So  they tried to warn us whenever they could.
 
Q:   And were they warning you about your po
tential arrest or about your father's  or 
both?
 
A:   Both.  The whole family. 
 But my father was taken away 
first.  And at the end, I'm 
sure it would have been  the whole family. 
 I don't reme mber what happened when we 
weren't home, when we were in hiding. Peop le may have come.  They may have been 

coming to lo ok 
for us anyway.
 
Q:   Have you been back 
to that region of France?
 
A:   I was back shortly -- Let's see.  In 1
954.  And that's the last time .  We'v e gone to 
Provence, my  husband and I, which isn't too fa
r away from there. And I've often wished 
to go back  and see what it all looks like now.
  Of course, the people who were there at 
that time are now gone.  I'm almo
st 80.  So  they are no longer there.  I just wish I could 
go back and see what the whole area looks lik
e now.  I still have a vision in my mind 
about it.  But we both have so
me health issues, so I don't think th at overseas travel are in 
our stars any mo re.
 

Q:   What's  the vision in  your mind that y
ou were talking about a 
mo ment ago of that 
region of France?
 
A:   Oh, always very -- well, I remember th
ere was an old castle not too far from where 
we lived.  And it was a water pump.  I reme
mb er walking over there and getting water.  
We had no running water. And I remember w a
lking in the countrys
ide.  I remember 
tending to the cows.  I re member milking the cows. A
nd the village, it's a very 
picturesque countryside, southern France.  Th
e climate w as fairly mild.  We did get a few 
snow flurries once in a while. I remember walking to school. 
 There was a girl's school 
and a boy's school.  And I rememb er -- I rememb
er seeing the girls in the Catholic church 
taking co mmunion in th eir white gown s. An
d I rememb er going shopping with my  
mother. I remember her chasi
ng me with a broom around the kitchen table wh en I was 

misbehaving.  I remember the neighbors ac
ross the way from wherewe lived, they were 
ladies who were elderly, dressed all in black
 with the long sk irt still, widows.  And I 
remember rodents crossing from one -- from one
 home to the other across the street.  
They were almost as big as -- 
there were sewer rats almo st as
 big as -- some of them as 
little cats. And I remember my 
mother taking out a box with
 tea bags to make tea -- I 
wasn't feel well -- and a mouse 
jump ing out of it.  I rememb
er her getting letters from my 
father once in a while while he
 was in the Army , and she would say, "Dad  is okay.  He'll 

try to come home." I remember h er having -- 
after my  sister was born and my  father had 
to leave again, I remember her 
trying to breast-feed her.  A
nd my  sister couldn't get any 
milk.  And she would -- my  mo ther had an 
in fection. Her breast was all blue.  And I 
remember a doctor who came on his bicycle, 
was a Jewi sh man who made the rounds to 
all the regions, I guess, to the people he knew
 were in hiding, coming to check her health.  
And that's about it.
 
Q:   Were you a religiously observant family in any way?
 
A:   Well, we couldn't .  My father always to
ld me, "Don't ever forget
 you're Jewish."  He 
was very observant, but we went to church.  We
 had to hide the fact that we were Jewish. 
And after the war I did go to synagogue, but 
we never kept kosher or anything like that.  
My father went to shul, to synagogue, after 
the war until the day he 
died, every Saturday.
 
Q:   So during th e five-year period that you we
re going to one place to the next, you were 

actively hiding the fact that you were Jewish?
 
A:   Right, right.
 
Q:   Did you feel that 
the commu nity knew anyway ?
 
A:   Most of the adults did, yes.
 
Q:   When was the first time that you to
ld  your husband your story from the war?
 

A:   I don't think he rea
lly knew up until 2001 -- bits 
and pieces probably, but my 
children didn't -- in 2001 when  
I wrote, to put it down on pape
r.  And my sister who came 
to visit last January, I gave it to her to read.  
She's quite proficient in the Englis language.  
She read it and she said, "I didn't know half 
of this." So my parents after the war, as I 
said, my mother never really 
spoke too much about her family
, up until the very end.  She 
mentioned one of her brothers
 whose name was Harry.  But she was already I think a bit 
of dementia had already set in.
 
Q:   So what was it that made 
you want to tell your story now?
 
A:   I heard other people telling.  And I deci
ded perhap s it would be a catharsis for me or 
it's a story that really -- th
e Holocaust shouldn't be forgo
tten. And my -- the temp le we 
belong to , we're looking fo r a speaker every 
year, Yom Ha'S hoah.  Someone comes to 
speak.  So I decided, Well, I'll 
write my  story down  as best as I could.  And that's how 
this came about. And it 's sti
ll -- I don't know -- it's still so
me of these things still come 
back to me when  I read them and I get all upset, unfortu nately.
 
Q:   If you were to pick  one mo ment of your 
story that you th ink is the mo st important, 
what would it be?
 
A:   That's the most important
.  Our survival.  The way we su
rvived.  What my father did 
during the war. That, I never knew until afterwards.
 
Q:   How did you find th at out?
 
A:   Well, after the war he just talked ab
out it. And not everything.  I saw he was in 
Who's Who, and I read his stories.  And he re
ally was in harm's way.
  And they liberated 
cities.  He really did some 
extraordinary, wonderful things
 to fight Nazism.  A nd as I 
said, I'm grateful for the fact that u n like a 
lot of our Jews, that we didn't end up in the 
concen tration camps. And my  husband and I to
ok a trip to eastern Europe a few years 
ago, and we went through Au schwitz. And th
at was -- I don't know.  I can 't fin d  the 
words. I figured that if my gr
andparents, my uncles died there,
 that the least I could do is 
visit it.  But it was very, very difficult. It's
 unbelievable what we saw there. Unbelievable 
that they're human beings who 
could inflict such things to other human beings. And my  
father also wrote a poem while he was in the 
Marquis, the French Underg round.  And th is 
poem is now in the archives of Yad Vashem
. And if you like it, I have an English 
translation.  We could e-mail it.
 
Q:   Do you have it with you th
at you can read for the recording?
 
A:   I have it here.  This is an English tr
anslation, originally wr
itten in German.  It's 
dedicated, "To my  dear children,
 by Bernard Mann, 1943." I am
 lying on hard straw and I 
keep pondering over and over wh
at could be done to allevi
ate the suffering of the Jews, 
but no so lution comes to me.  I can only describe
 to you, my dear children, what this or 

that person was doing. One, who did they ro u
nd up?  Who did they not allow to sleep and 
drive around like shepherds dr
ive sheep?  The Jews.  W ho do
 they lock up
 an d put in 
chains?  I would like to bet it would be the Je
ws. Why must they suffer?  Why must they 
waste away?  People will explain to you it is be
cause they are Jews.  It did not help to 
flee.  It did not help to r
un. They  watched them.  They burned th em.  They are living 
corpses, the Jews. They had many friends, in
 quotations, but none 
would or co uld help 
but rather left them to the 
hungry Wolves, 
the Jews. There were many democratic states.  
I will tell y ou what they did for the Jews.  No
thing.  They demanded florins, dollars, and 
pounds.  Whoever did not have
 them had to end like misera
ble hounds, a
nd whoever did 
not have enough Sw iss francs was left locked 
behind the border gates.  Only the Jews.  
They wandered around, families 
torn apart, their homes destr
oyed, thrown into camps, in 
the grimmest cold and 
without bread.  They  held out unt
il they would be redeemed by the 
death that they longed
 for.  The Jews. Men worked hard
 and dug coal while their wives 
were sent to Poland.  Where did the children 
stay? Where had they remained?  They were 
frustrated, longing for their parents. In some
 instances there was a person with lots of 
dollars who flew over borders. 
 Even America stood open to hi
m, could help  to spend the 
war there in security, wrote long pages with
 many wo rds, spoke on the radio now and 
then, and so the good man belie
ved that he was doing a lot of
 good for the Jews. Others 
fought in that distant land.  
They fought the enemy in desert
 sand.  They  merited great 
honor worthy of the Maccabees.  
Their graves have been cove
red with sand.  For them 
all, that remains is to say Ka
dish for the Jews.  That's it.
 
Q:   When did you receive the poem?
 
A:   Well, we found it among my father's -- af
ter his death, among the papers.  He told us 
that he had written a poem whic
h is in Yad Vashem.  There'
s a number, Register Number 
7521.
 
Q:   Is there anything else that you woul
d like to tell me about that I haven't asked?
 
A:   That you haven't 
asked?  No.  I would only say that
 my father always spoke, "You 
must forget or try to forget.  Live on.  En
joy the future.  We must
 go on." Our immediate 
family survived, and we must 
go on.  But my mother never fo
rgot.  And she always said 
to us, "My heart is like a stone."  But she sa
id, "You have to live 
for the future." And I 
have to say, that's the last 52, 53 years, 
I had a rough ch ildhood, but I've had a good life 
since then.  And I'm grateful to be in this
 wonderful country.  I wouldn't be anywhere 
else.  And I think th at's  
about all I can think of.
 
Q:   Thank you, very  mu ch, Mrs. Co
ppel.  I'm going to stop the tape now.
 
A:   Thank you.
 
Conclusion of Interview
