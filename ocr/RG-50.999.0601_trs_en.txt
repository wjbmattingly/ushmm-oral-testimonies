passed away andm y fam ily sponsored
 
F i rs t  Pers o n
;

connectiontothis. My dad was aG.I. inW orldW arII. He didn't get to any campsbuthe saw

Nat will share with us his
 
f irst  pe rso n a ccou
nt for about 45 m inutes. I
f we have tim e, 
we wil l have questionsfrom  theaudience.W e'll have 
questions
.W e'll explain later.
 
 
T he lif e stories of Holocaust survi vors transcend thedecades.W hatwe are about to 
hearf rom  Nat is
 
one individual's account of
 
the Holocaust.W e have prepared a brief  slide 
presentation
 t
o help wi th an introduction.
 
 
Let's see if  I can do this. Nat
 
Sh a f f i r  
was born Nathan Spitzer Decem ber
 
26, 1936, in 
Rom ania. Nat has three birthdays.W e'll get to that later.
 
 
In this photograph,
 
thephotograph you saw already, we had Nathanwith his parents 
andhis sisters,Saraand Lily. And here is Rom ania,for you who didn't do well in geography 

cla ss.  
So there's Romania.
 
 
Near 
I a si
, shown onthis m ap, Nathan'sf amily owned adairy f arm . In 19
41 the fascist 
Iron Guard conf iscated the farm and all the cattle justbecause Nathan's family was Jewish. 
 

2 
 
T he f am ily m oved to a neighborhood of  
I a si 
where Nathan'sf ather, Anton, was able to keep 
cows and hism other,Fany, bartered products in exchangef
o r 
tutoring for the children.
 
 
W hen Anton was sentto perform forced labor in early 1944, 8
-
year
-
old Nathan helped 
hisf am ily continue to m ake dairy products. Af ter 
I a s i 
fell tothe Russians in the summ erof  
1944, hisdad returned to hisfam ily. T hey stayed in Romaniafor several years bef ore 
em igrating to Israel.
 
 
T here'sm oreabout Nat's lif e in Am erica in your booklet but we want to spend mostof  
our time today hearing from  Nat andhis timeduring the Holocaust.
 
 
W ith that introduction, we'd like to welcom e to the stage, our
 
F i rs t  Pe rs on
 
today Nat 
Shaff ir. Come on down.
 
>>
 
[Applause] 
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
Cheers.
 
T hank you, Nat.W e've got a lot to go through. 
 
 
I just want to rem ind you whenW orldW ar IIstarted, Nat was 3, soduring his 
presentation I'm  going to askhim to rem ind us how old he is duringeachof  these segments so 

that you will be hearing a story about lif e in the ghetto and you have to rememberhow old he 

was when he was survivin g and dealing with the diff icult circum stances hisfam ily was pl
unged 
into.
 
 
So the Germ ans invade Poland in 1939. You're in Rom ania. I know you're very young 
at the tim ebuttell usabout the comm unity, your dad's dairy f arm, growin g up before the war 

sta rte d
. W
hatdo you rem ember about that? 
 
>> N a t  S h af f i r :
B
efore the war started, I think it was pretty norm al.W e didn't have any 
electricity, any running water. It was a prim itive life but it was a good lif e. For a while we wer e 

able to go to kindergarten. I went tof irst grade. I hadboth Jews and non
-
Jewish f riends a
nd  
things were ok.W e were pretty wealthy
 
at the tim e. Lif e was ok.
 
>> W a rren  Ma rc u s :
 
So relations with non
-
Jews was nothing memorable?
 
>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
Everyth ing was ver y m uch thesam e.W e never saw a diff erencebetweenthe 
Jewish boys or Jewish kids and 
non
-
Je wish  kid s.
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
Inyour town, was it a large Jewish comm unity, sm all?
 
>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
Actually, m yf ather imm igratedoriginall y f rom  the eastern part of  Hungary. He 
and his two 
brothers im m igrated in
 
1924
,  
af terW orldW ar I. He established a large dairy farm . 
So the comm unity was  approxim ately 25 Jewishf am ilies, about 89. It was af arm com munity. 

In other words, it was one of  the surrounding farm ing areas.Andours was probably oneof the 

largest farm s.
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
And you had good
 
relationships with the otherfarm ers, Jewish and 
non
-Je wish
. 
Tell usabout thepriest who came by once a week.
 
>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
W hathappened, getting backa little bit.
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
S ur e .
 
>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
The way m y f ather em igrated.
 
Bothm y parents were born in
 
the easternpart of  
Hungary. M y m other was the oldestof  12 children andm yf ather was the youngest of six. In 

1924, afterW orldW arI, m yf ather andtwo of his eldest brothers em igrated to Romaniaand 

that's where they establishedthefarm.
 
 I
n 1931, m yf ather was still single anddecided he wantedto getm arried. His other two 
brothers were already m arried.Sothe most logical place tof ind abride was to go back tothe 

comm unity that you cam e f rom. So he went back tothe 
v
illage that he cam e 
f ro m . A nd  at  t ha t  
point it didn't have any f indthebride.com . He went to a matchm aker.
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
No yenta.com .
 

3 
 
>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
No. T hey went to a m atch
maker. Thetwo fam ilies knew each other. They were 
both in the livestock business. So they were tr ading. So they knew each other.Som y father's 
requirem ents were to have a niceperson, a goodhom em aker, som ebody who could take care 

of  the children andeducate the children. Obviously today would notbe very politically cor rect 

to request som ething li
ke that. But those days
 
--
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
W e'll save thatfor the Q&A.
 
>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
My daughters and granddaughters don'tapprove of  thatbutthat's what 
happened.Sohefound a bride. He brought her back to Rom ania.And bef ore long, three 

children 
were born, two girls and a boy
,  
and I'm  thatboy.
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
All right. So you have thebig dairy f arm . You'redoingf airly well. It's 
interesting to say we're doing very well, alm ost wealthy but no electricity, no running water.
 
>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
W el
l,that's what it was. Right. But we were happy. 
 
 
But you askedm e if my f ather got along with otherfarmers. Notonly did he getalong 
with them but inm ost cases,m any cases,m any years, he helpedthef arm ers. Many tim es 

there were droughts.These were smallerf arm s where they didn'thave enough need tofeed 

their cattle. Instead ofsending them  to the slaughterhouses which would get m aybef ive cents 

on thedollar per pound,m y f ather would buy f rom them based on the normal f air market value. 

He helped them out giving them f eed for seeding when they didn't have any m oney. He alwa ys 

was ver y good to thefarm ers. He always helpedthem out.
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
And that's the way one wouldhope would work with your neighbors.This 
wi ll com e back into the story later on.
 
 
T ell us, again, about the localpriest who visit ed oncea week.
 
>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
W e lived in a nicearea. One of our neighbors was apriest. Once a week he 
would com e by and ask m y fatherf or a donationfor the church andalsof or some dairy 

prod
ucts f or some
 
of his congregants who couldn'taff ord to buy. Inalm ost 20 years m y father 
never once refused such a request. Oneday in Novem ber,1942
 
--
 
well bef ore that, back a 
little bit. Every tim e the priest cam e over, m y m other always used to tell us,the children, go out 

and greet the priest. You know, it was the nice thing to do. Andevery time we saw him , we 

would go outside.W e lived on thefarm , when you saw thef ields, you saw him com ing 

throughout open. So you com e out, ask about his health, hisfam ily, wish him  a good day.
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
You all knew him .
 
>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
W e all knew the priest.
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
Let's wait f or the 
`
42, for that one.
 
>> N a t  S h af f i r :
O k.  
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
I teasedthem  saying you hadthree birthdays. Can you explain that a little 
b it ?
 
>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
W e weref ar away f rom  the big city. So when som eone was born, they couldn't 
register the sam e time people were born. Som y f ather wouldm arkdown thebirthdays ona 

Bible.W hen he gota chance, he went to thebig city and registeredus.
 
Somehow, the register, 
either whenhearrived thereor when he registered whenm y actualbirthday was
 
--
 h
e m ust 
have comem aybe two m onths later,am onthlater. So m y regular birthday was recordedas 

December
 
28 ,  19 39
, December
 
26,1936, 
D ec e m be r
 
26, 1938. So three different tim es.W e 
didn't know exactly wh at happened.
 
 
One tim e, an uncle ofm ine, which later we will f ind out what happened to him, came 
to visit us. It was in July. His children called to wish a happy birthday. So m y m other, which it 

wa s  h
is
 
older sister, said, he wasn't born in July. T here was snow onthe ground when you 

4 
 
were born. So anyway,  what happened, he sent away to the Romanian em bassy a requestto 
get a birth certif icate. And he got it. And obviously his birthday is in February. So I didthe 

sam e thing. I sent away to the Rom anian government, petition to sendm ea copy of m y birth 

certif icate.It tooka while because Romania, until recently, didn't havefaxes yet. Sof inally got 

m y birth certif icate, which is D
e c em be r
 
26, 1936.
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
Now, you all doa little m ath. I just want to tell you, Natand I were talking 
about training this summ er to running the Bostonm arathon. Just keep that inm ind. He's run it 

t wi c e .
 
>>
 
[Applause] 
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
T wo  B o
stonmarathons,f ive Marine Corps marathons. That makes you 
feel all guilty, I hope.
 
>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
All af ter 65.
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
Thanks, Nat,for underlining thatfor us.
 
 
Last thing aboutbirthdays. Do you get two or threebirthday parties every year?
 
>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
No. But diff erentf riends anddifferentf am ily m em bers always wish m ea happy 
birthday lateor early.
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
I have to work on that.
 
 
All right. Let's shift back into thehistorical time period. So this is before 
`
39. So we 
have
 
the background.A lot of yourf am ily li ves nearby but 
you 
do have a signif icant number of  
fam ily m em bers in Hungar y. Right? 
 

>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
My entiref am ily cam ef rom eastern Hungary which r em ained there.W e will talk 
about later on what happenedtothem.But the only people that came were m y two uncles,m y 

father's brother and him andm y m other thatcam e overf rom Hungary
 t
o Rom ania.
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
Let's shift gearsf rom 
`
39 to 
`
41.Sothe Germ ans invade Poland,W orld 
W ar II starts. How does that change your life? Doesthe governm ent change? Does lifefor 

Jews in Rom ania change?
 

>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
It was a fascist governm ent until 1941. 1941 we started hearing things going on 
in the world, particular things, Jews being sent to gas cham bers, Jews are being
 
k ille d ,  J ews  
are sent to slave labor cam ps. So because ofthese little things
 
--
 
becausethere was no radio 
or television or newspaper.T he way we heard things was prim arily f rom themarket.People go 

to the m arket and f ind out. Som e of  them  were rumors. 
Some of them  were actually facts.So 
we'll hear stories com ing back.
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
Let m e interruptf ora question because this comes up all the tim e. Did 
people believe that? Did they believe it or didthey sort of hesitate?W hat was the reaction? 

T he
re's notm uch historical precedencefor this kind of large
-
scale action.
 
>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
W esaw som e of  whatthey called the Legionnaires, which was part of  the Iron 
Guard government, little by little changing their outlook against Jewish people, more 

anti
-
Sem itic things.W e saw certain things happening where they didn't happenbefore.
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
So that's the local context, as you're hearing much worse storiesf rom , say, 
Poland.
 
>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
Righ t .
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
So there'sa global story going on and thenthere's things getting worse 
and worsef or you.
 
So I think
 
--
 
tell us about the 
Ia s i
 
pogrom. T hat was 
`
41? 
 
>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
Actually a little later on. T herewere a couple. Pogrom  is som ething that 
individual citizens kill other citizens strictly f orm onetary values, monetary reasons. It was ok by 

the governm entto do so. In other words, the governm ent didnot say not to do certain things. It 

5 
 
was sponsored by thegovernm ent ina way, condoned by the gover nm ent.Prim arily 1941 
there was abig pogrom  in 
Ias i
 
where 10,000 people were killed within two days, July
 
1941.
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
10,000.
 
>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
10,000.
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
A nd  
t h is  is  p a ram ilit a rie s ,  c ivi lia n s ?
 
>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
Anybody that wanted somebody as his property or som ebody el
se 's t h in gs 
would just go ahead and do things like that.And they were killed brutally with shovels, axes, 

whoever had guns with guns but they were kill ed brutally.
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
Did you know anyone, yourfam ily know anyone or lose any fam ily in that 
p
articular
 
--
 
>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
In1941, in addition to the pogrom  was a train startedup inthe southern part of  
Rom ania going to 
I a si
.T hey were f erried in the heatof  the summ erof  Rom ania,ferriedf or 
threedays backandf orth without any reason. Most of the people in thesethree trains were 

dead when they returned to 
I a si 
af ter three days. One of m y f ather's brothers was am ong these 
trains.
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
So these were basically cattle cars.W hen you go upstairs, there's two 
things I want you to remem b
er
, t
wo of  them any things you'll rem emberf rom  that story. One, 
you wi ll see a cattle car of  the kind used tomove Jews around, sim ilar to theone used inthe 

I a si 
train.And also, there are actually pictures f rom  
t h is  
episode of these trains being unload
ed 
where Nat lost oneof his uncles.
 
 
So at that tim e, you were pretty young buthow did your f am ily react?W hatdid you 
think you could do?W hat did you think about?
 

>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
Firstof all, we were pretty f araway, aboutfour hours away f rom  
Ia s i
 
it
self . So 
actually in our comm unity, there weren't thatm any Jewish people in thef irst place so it wasn't 

really in volved in that.So we didn't 
--
 
we didn't suffer in our own
 
--
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
But you heard about it.
 
>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
W eheard about it, yes.W e were scared, obviously. You hear things like that. 
W edon't know if it's going to com e your way, stay in thebig city only.
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
Som etim espeople say, w
e ll,  d id  
you 
think about leaving
.  
Did that come 
up?
 

>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
No
. T
hat's your hom e.T hat'swhere you stayed. You don't go anywhere.
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
Ok. And just so we're clear, pogrom isf rom  Russian word, anorganized 
attackeither supported by the governm ent orengineered by the government. And there had 

been pogrom s aroundEurope, in some countries f rom  the1880son. So this isn't thef irsttim e 

this happened. Probably wasn't thef irstpogrom  in Romaniabutthiswas a big one at thispoint 

in  t im e.
 
 
All right. So even with all of  thesef ears, andhearing som eof  the internationa
l n e ws  
and it's work time, the dairy f arm, lif e is still ok. Right?
 

>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
Yeah.
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
But then itall changes in Novem ber
 
1942. Let'sget back to the visit f rom  
your neighbor.
 
>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
Since we were such a largefarm , thebiggest client, biggest customer that my 
parents had was the Rom anian Arm y.T hey shipped them  all of their dairy products.
 
 
So in November
 
1942,the same priest that used to com eby onceaweek cam eby. 
Howe ver, this tim e hecame with an arm ed police off icer and two 
I
ron Guard soldiers, also 
arm ed.W e saw these three,fourpeople com ing towards us.W e allwent out to greethim to 

6 
 
f ind out what was going on.W hen we came close to the group,the priest turned to the police 
off icer andpointing atus and said to the police off icer, [Speaking Non
-
English Language], 
" These are Jews."  Sothe police off icer at that point told us we hadfour hours to vacate the 

farm  because he has orders to take us to the
 
--
 
to relocate us to a different area.
 
 
My f athertried to reason with him . He said
, ﬁ
I've known you since you were a littleboy. 
I've known your f am ily. Can't you do som ething about it,forget the order?
: 
He s a id
, ﬁ B
ecause 
you know m e andbecause you know m y family, I'm  gi ving you f ourhours.
ﬂ 
Otherwise he didn't 
have todo that.
 
My m other realized she's notgoing to beableto change his m ind.She 
ordered three of us into the house and told us to putonas many warm  clothing as possible, 

m any layers of  clothing.
 
 
Now, Rom ania is very cold in the winter and very hot in the summ er.Novem ber was 
already pretty cold, snow on the ground. Sowe went in the home.My m other,first thing, took 

whatever m oney we had in the house,any kind of jewelry or valuables.T hen we started 

loading a one
-
horse wagon.W e were allowed totake whatever we could loadon that wagon.
 
So we tookblankets,pillows, cooking utensils, anything pretty muchthat we needed. 
 
 
W ealready heard thata certain area was established, back in1941. So 1941, the 
so -
called ghetto was established by the IronGuard.
 
W henthe policem an told us we would be 
relocated we canpretty much knew where we were going, so we took whatever.
 
A ls o ,  a sm a ll 
wagon, besidesf ive people plus whatever things we had, wasn't thatm uch. 
 
 
So afterfour hours were over, the policem an told ustim e is up and we had
 
--
 
h e 
escorted us through the city.
 
Once we arrived
 
--
 
now, there's two kinds of ghettos, open and 
closed ghettos. 
I a si 
was anopen ghetto, which means Jews were able tom ove around within 
the perimete
r of the area. T hey couldn't leave certain streets pas
t  
that
 s
o we stay in the sam e 
area. 
 
 
So we arrived in the ghetto.W e were turned over to theauthorities.And the 
authorities right away t old us
 
--
 
they gave us one room , that that's where we're going to be 
staying.
 
So com ing f rom  a big house into one room with thef ive of us. In that room  all we had 
was t wo beds. There was nothing in therenoclosets,no cooking place, nothing whatsoever. 

So we were gi ven thatroom . 
 
 
W eunloaded the wagon.W e were toldby authorities to show up the next m orning to 
gi ve us 
t h e 
rules of the ghetto, what we can and cannot do. Most of  it was what we cannot do 
obviously. So everybody kind of  was in abad m ood, com ing inf rom a large house to a one 

room .
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
It
 
had to be very traum atic. Again, how old are you atthis tim e?
 
>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
6.
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
And your sisters?
 
>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
8 and 4.
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
O k.
 
>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
Soobviously there was a problem  there.
 
Sothe nextm orning when we arrive
d 
to the authorities, number one, they were
 
--
 
we were told thatanybody between the agesof 18 
and50m ust do work, m ust work, manual work prim arily. T hey would not get paid. Jews 

cannot,even though they hadm oney, cannotgo outand buy ontheopen marke
t anything. So 

instead we were receiving ration. Andthe ration allowed us bread, kerosene f or cooking and 

heating andother items. Other item s usually l ike oil and sugar were told in the blackm arket. 

W enever saw those.
 

7 
 
 
So primarily we were getting a quarter of a loaf  of bread every two days per person. 
Sof orf ive of usto geta loaf and a quarter every t wo days.W e were also gettingf ive liter of 
kerosenef or cooking and heating. Now,f ive liters is abouta littleover a gallon, two and a half 

gallons,
 
som ething like that.
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
I never understoodmetrics.
 
>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
It wa sn 't th atm u ch .
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
So theauthorities,are they the Iron Guard? Are they the 
Ia s i
 
police? W ho 
was running things?
 

>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
The police department.
 
So they were gi vin g all the rules. Num berone, Jewish 
children couldno longer go to school.Synagogues were closed.W e could no longer go and 

worship. And that wasthe thing that eachone individual would get ajob,manual job. My 

father's job was to go out in the summ er time, sweep the streets and until the wintertim e shovel 

the snow.
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
And this isaf tera very successf ul, respected career of providing f orhis 
fam ily as adairy f arm er andhis neighbors. So it's atremendous change.
 
>> N a t
 
S h af f i r :
 
Yeah.So every m orning them an would go out
 
--
 
by the way, when we arrived 
at the ghetto,they took our names,ages, gender down.T hey knew exactly wh
e re
 
each 
individual person lived.
 
 
T he way it was set up,there were big houses. Eachhousehad 
maybe f our or f ive 
bedroom s. Each bedroom  was given to onefam ily. So inthat house we li ved with f ive other 

fam ilies.So it was ver y crowded.T he whole ghetto was crowded. But in particular, it was very 

crowded. 
 
 
So every m orning them an would go out to do the work and come back later in the 
evening, or late in the af ternoon.
 
W hen I asked m y m other
 
--
 
m y motherheard that they need 
certain people, certain jobs to take. My m other heardthe needfor nurses. Now, she was the 

oldest of  12 children. She actual
ly raised theother 11 children.So she said she's anurse. 
T hey put her in thehospital to do manual work, you know, cleaning toilets and doing things. So 

obviously it was better than doing certain things on the street.
 
 
My older sister was alr eady 8. So she was able tobea maid to oneof  the officials, to 
clean the houses
, t
o the police. So m y mother was working in the hospital. My f ather was 
usually workin g on thestreets, sweeping the streets.
 
 
Oneday, the person who was in charge to clean them arket area died. And the next 
m orning when peoplewere allocating the jobs, m yf ather was called outfrom the lineand says 

your job now is to go and clean them arket area.
 
T he m arket, the 
Ia s i
 
m arket was alwa ys on a 
T hursday. SoThursday was the marketfor 
I as i
. So he was sent outto do manual work, clean 
horsem an you're, ox man you'ref rom  the streets.T hat's pretty m uch what he was doingfor a 

wh ile .
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
And what is little Nat doing?
 
>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
W ell,f irst of all to collect the rations, we had to go out of  the ghetto. Number 
one, we were gi ven a yellow star with the word Jew on it.W ecouldn't leave the ghetto without 

that star. Anybody caught would be severely punished.
 
To receive the rations, we had to go 
outof  the ghetto. You couldnot l
eave before 5:00
 
a.m .Although m y sister was older,m y f ather 
alwa ys used to sendme out to get the rationsbecause a lotof  hooligans were picking on 

Jewish gi rls. So he was afraidfor m y sister so he sent me out.
 
Ma ny t i m e s  I  c am e 
back
 
--
 
these hooligans
 
pickedon Jewish boys as well. Man y tim es I cam ehom e with abloody 

8 
 
noseand messed upface. Butthat didn't hurt asm uch as whenthese hooligans tookm y 
breadaway, which m eansfor the next two days we didn't have anything to eat.
 
 
T he  f irst tim e  th is ha
ppened,m y m other realized this could happenagain so she 
started rationing our own f am ily. So until sheaccumulatedevery t wo  days instead of 

consum ing a loaf anda quarter, we consumed a loaf and a quarter less a slice. Thenext tim e 

le ss t wo  slice s.  S o  
she accum ulatedupto one loaf of bread reserve. And actually this thing did 

happenagain later on.So at least we did have som ething toeat.T hat was one of the things 

thatm yf ather used to sendm e out to get therations.
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
Just so we're clear historically. T hem useum  just foundoutthere were over 
42,000 ghettos, jails, and places of incarceration. As Nat rightly pointedout, som eof  these 

ghettoshad walls, the W arsaw Ghetto.Som e d
id  
not.Som e you could never leave. You could 
leave this
 
onefor various reasons.
 
 
So in themorning, 
you 
would go outto getthe keroseneor use theration card. So you 
were the delivery boy f or thefam ily.
 
>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
Right.Again, we hadto goout, leave the ghetto to go out.T he bakery was 
outside the ghetto.W e had to line up.T he sam efor the kerosene, line up.
 
And then individ uals 
who were not Jewish were able to just go passed and come inf ront of  thebakery and buy 

whatever they wanted. The Jews had to wait in line to get their rations.
 
>> W a rren Ma
rcu s:  
Not  o n ly 
were you 
restricted on what you couldget but what you could get 
was ver y m inim al. It was very dif f icult.
 
 
I know a story aboutand a guy, this guy Gri gory. T ell usabout yourinteraction with 
this Grigory guy.
 
>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
Let mego back
 
if  I  M ay .
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
Sure. You're the boss.
 
>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
W henm y f ather worked in cleaning them arket area, what happened
 
--
 
t he  
farm ers would gather everyWednesday nightas a group. And atm idnight they would leave, 

W ednesday night to get to the city by Thursday m orning. SoThursday m orning, oneThursday 

m orning, this oldfarmer saw m y f ather cleaning thearea. He cam eover to him and said, 

Mr.
 
Spitzer, I'm  so sorry to see you inthe condition you are. I know you were a wealthy person. 
You helpedus a lot. Seeing you in the degrading condition you arein right now breaksm y 

heart.I'm going to try to help you out a little bit. I'm going to speakto some of the otherfarm ers 

you helped in thepast. Perhaps we canhelp
 
you in some way. 
 
 
T he  ne xt  
T hursday when he cam e back, theoldfarm er went over to him and said we 
agreed to help you and here'show we're goin g to dothat. He said the Caravan starts in af ield 

in m idnight, pass the outskirts of the ghetto between 2:00
 
and 3:00
 
in the morning.W hy 
don ' t  
you show up between those hours at a certain area behind a certain building.W atch out f or the 

last three wagons of  the convoy.W e will f akea breakdown.T hen we wil l throw som ething your 

wa y .
 
 
Som y f atherdidn't tell m y m other what he planned to do
 
because my m other was the 
rationalperson. Shealwa ys thinks what could go wrong. M y f ather alwa ys took a chance.
 
So  
thenext Thursday m y father wentoutbetween 2:00
 
and 3:00
 
in the m orning. Now, anybody 
caught between 2:00
 
and 3:00
 
in the m orning outsid
e the ghetto only m eantone thing, the guy 
is tryin g to escape.That would be punishable by death or som etimes im prisoned.Som y father 

took that chance. Again, that's one way to have his fam ily survi ve. So he went out. Exactly 

what happened thefarm ers told him  would happen.They faked abreakdown. T he last three 

wagons, bef ore you know it, oneof  them , tossed a sack to where my f ather was. My f ather 

9 
 
waited for a while until ever ybody lef t, lookedaround when there was no police. He took the 
bag and cam ehom e with it. Andthen we found som epotatoes,f ruit,cheese, different 

products, different times. This happened alm ost ona weekly basis.
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
So we understandthe risk for yourf ather to be there inthe m iddleof  the 
night
. T
here's clearly ri sk for thesepeople,too, to do that
. I
f they we re caught
, w
hat m ight have 
happened to them ?
 

>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
They took their lif e in jeopardy. Not only their life in jeopardy, a
lso the jeopardy 
of  t he ir f am ilie
s. But thef arm ersf iguredthat's a good thing
 
to do becausem y father helped 
them  a lot inthe past.So this is som ething maybe a payback in a way, if  you want to call it 

th a t.
 
 
T hat went onfor a while until later on,f inally thefarm er came and said to m yf ather, 
I'm  sorry, we can't do it anym orebecause som ebody complained to theauthorities that som e 

of  thefarm ersare helping Jewish people
; w
ecan't takea chance like thatfor us andfor your 
fam ilies.Sothat stopped after about sevento eight months. 
 
 
But while this was going on, it was really
 
grea tf or us. Num berone, in every ghetto, 
the same in this ghetto, there was alwa ys a big black m arket. So people still had som e money. 

Some people would risk their lives and goout and bring in productsandobviously sell it for 

ver y high prices.
 
>> W a r
ren  Ma rc u s :
 
Sm uggle things in at great risk.
 
>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
Right.But there were certainthings peopleneeded,shoes, pants,things like 
t h is
, a
lso som efood products. So when we received all of  these things f rom  thefarmers, 
som etimes we hadmaybe six potatoes, we would tradetwo of  themfor som ething else,an 

egg or two. So we would trade like that.
 
 
Som y f ather would always take me to the area we traded on theblack market.And 
the reason he used to take m ealong is because if  a grown
-
up was caught wi
th  th is 
contraband, he would im mediately be arrested. A child would probably be slappedarounda 

couple of tim es and let go.
 
Many, m any years  after 
t h e 
war m y f ather told people he always  
took m e along for his protection.
 
>>
 
[Laughter]
 
>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
W hat
 
happened, they established certain ways of going to the black market 
area. I'll keep the contraband. He'll walk around 30,40
 
feet ahead of us.W hen he saw 
policemen, he would walk offonthe sidewalk into the streetm eaning I shouldhide. Sothat's 

how.
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
And how old are you? 
 
>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
At thispoint getting to 7 years old.
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
Ok. So you're sm uggling at 7 years old, negotiating on the black market at 
7.
 
>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
A little later on. My father didall thenegotiationsat this tim e. 
 
 
But inthe meantime, we're going outto the kerosene in them orningonce a week.W e 
line up at5:00
 
in themorning, winter and summ er.W inter in particular was cold.T he 
attendant 
would show up som etim esaround 7:00, 7:30. And 
t he  
wa y  i
t was established, the way you 
were supposed to get the kerosene, was not like today you have thegas stations. Say like a 

booth
,  in
 
thef ront of the booth was a little pum p. Inthef ront of thepump was a cylinder. In 
f ront of the cylinder was a handle. E
very tim e you m oved the handle back and forth that would 
bring up the kerosenewith that cylinder. Once the cylinder was f ull,it was f ive liters. You put 

that intoa can.
 

10
 
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
That was your ration.
 
>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
That was m y rationf or the week. Right.
 
 
So this individual
 
--
 
there was like a big wide line six feetaway f rom the booth. He 
would m otionf rom  theline f orf ive people to com ef orward, remove their ration couponf or the 
week
 a
nd thenf ill the kerosene.
 
T his individual was an uneducated, lazy drunk
, t
he  gu y t ha t  
actually dispersed the kerosene.
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
How d id  
you 
f eel about him  then?
 
>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
W ell,I tell you, things workedoutfor me andI'll tell you why. But he didn't like 
to work in particular. He always stood in thebooth waiting to warm  up, then come outand get 

f ive more people.
 
Oneday I had the guts to tell him
 
--
 
his name was Grigor y. I told him
 
--
 
I 
proposed to him ,dom ino [phonetic] Grigory
 
--
 
the word dom ino
 
is the title youusually gi ve to 
the president
 
of a school, som eoneof  authority but I called him  it to give him  a little bit of 
prestigious thing. I said, 
ﬁ
I'd like to help you.
ﬂ 
So he's looking atm e. I wasn't a very tall kid. He 
said to me," You're going to helpm e? I said, 
ﬁY
eah.
ﬂ 
He  s a id,  
ﬁH
ow are you going to do that?
ﬂ 
I 
said, 
ﬁY
ou look sick.
ﬂ 
Probably had ahangover. 
ﬁ
You look sick. Letme do the work f or you. 
And if  it pleases you, perhaps you can give me a little extra kerosene because m y little sister is 

sick, we could use a little extra heat
 
in the house.
ﬂ 
He didn't say anything.
 
 
T he next week when I line up, he cam e out and lookedfor me in the line. He saw m e, 
m otioned to me to come forward. He said tom e, 
ﬁL
etm e see whatyou can do.
ﬂ 
So Idid. I was 
pumping the keroseneback andforth. I
 
did a really great job f or him .I was hoping to get 
som ething in return. Nothing
,  
nothing this week. Nothing the next week. Nothing the third 
week. 
 
 
I realized what a dumm y I m ust have been doing all the work and not getting anything 
in return. But in the fourth week he said to me, 
ﬁL
ittle Juden, next we ek bring anextra canwith 
you.
ﬂ 
Sof rom  thatpoint onheused to give m e either ate a liter or half
-
liter extra kerosene. 
T hat worked pretty m uch for a long tim e.Soby using extra kerosene I was able, again to trade 

a little bitf or something else.
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
And lateron there was anotherexchange.
 
>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
W hat happened, in 1942
 
--
 
well, this was on for a while. So1944,there was a 
big notice putout in the ghetto thatanybody between the
 
age of  18 and 50 m ust assemble in a 
certain area andtobring warm  clothing.
 
Obviously anybody that refuses to assemble, refuses 
to show up, would be punished som etim es by death or sometimes imprisoned. Everybody 

assembled because they knew exactl y where everybody li ved, whic h houses everybody li ved.
 
W eheard everybody needed to bring warm  clothing, we knew they were being sent to 

som eplace else. Also, the notice saidthey would not be com ing back ondaily basis. So we 

knew that's what's going to happen. W eheard people hadbeen sentto slave labor camps.
 
 
So the day thatm yf ather went tothe assembly area, we all hugged, cried. W enever 
knew when we were going to seem y f atheragain if ever. The last minutebefore he left, I 

askedhim If  I could wal
k 
with him  to theassem bly area andhe saidyes. And we walked hand 
in hand.Andf inally wh en we get closeto theassembly area, he said tom e, put hishandon 

m y shoulder and said
,  ﬁI
t's tim ef or you to goback.
ﬂ 
He looked at m y eyes and said
 
--
 
I ' l l  neve r  
forget. He said, 
ﬁ
Nat, take care of the girls.
ﬂ 
Here I am alm ost 9 years old,putting m e in charge 
of  taking care of m y motherand two sisters.W hat could I say? I told him, yes, I will. I kept 

whatever f eeling Ihad
 
--
 
I didn't want to burst out and cry. I didn't wantm y f ather to seem e 
cry. So I prom isedhim  I would dothat.
 

11
 
 
 
Lateron throughall ofthis period of time thatm y f ather was not home I always 
rem em bered that I prom ised m yf ather that Iwould take care of thegirls, I would take careof  
t h em  
to make sure they sur vi ved. Many tim es lif e was ver y hard. I was ready to give up.But by 
gi ving up, that meant neitherm y sister or m y m other would survive. So I kept on going.
 
 
Oneday when m y father was awa y, I lookedfor a shirtunderneaththe bedbeca
use 
that was the close
t. I f ound a bottle of  a plum  brandy
. I took that tothe attendant. I wrappedit 
in another shirt because there was no wrapping.
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
T o G r i go r y.
 
>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
Yeah. I said
, ﬁ
I have a presentfor you.
ﬂ 
I unwrapped the s
hirt and showed him  
thebottle. His eyes lit up. So he said to me, 
ﬁ
I presum e you want som eextra kerosene.
ﬂ 
I sa id , 
ﬁN
o, actually, I don't.What I would liketo have is another ration cardf or af am ily off our.
ﬂ 
And today I still rem ember, how could Ievenhave the guts to askhim for something like that.
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
And you're 11 years old.
 
>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
9 years old. 
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
9 years old.
 
>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
So I'm gi ving him  thebottle. A few weeks later heactually cam e with a ration of  
fo
ur which m eant we get another loaf of bread every t wo days, anotherf ive liters of  kerosene 
oncea week. So now I had enough stuff to trade with. So that's what happened.
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
You certainly were li ving up to yourf ather's request.At9 years o
ld
, j
us t  
r e m em be r .
 
>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
Af terawhile, though, this Grigory took a pity on me, I presum e. Som etim eshe 
gi ve m e a chunk of cheeseor apieceof hisbread. He usedto tellm e, 
ﬁT
ake that to your little 
sist e r. ﬂ 
So obviously I would take that backhom e and share.Af tera while, he becam e 
re a lly
 
--
 
not af riend but someone I was able to trusta littlebit.
 
>> W a rren  Ma rc u s :
 
Let m e ask you something. When you go through the exhibit today, learn 
about the Holocaust, you learn about lif eanddeath in ghettos, arepeople in the 
Ia s i
 
gh e t to 
worr ied aboutbeing taken away? Is there health,disease issues?W hat's life like in the ghetto 

in term s of health and daily
 
--
 
>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
Therewas al ways a problem
 
--
 
f am ine was oneof  the big problem s.W edidn't
 
have enough to eat. You went to sleep hungry and woke uphungry. Bathing, had abath once 

a week. There was a public bathhouse.T hewom en were allowed to go on Thursdays and m en 

on Fridays.W intertime not so badbut sum mer tim e it™sa problem. So disease was a problem . 

T here was nodoctorsprim arily, no medication.T here were peopledying.
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
All at the sam e time,at 9 or 10.
 
 
W hile you're inthe ghetto for those years, doyou have any conception about what's 
happening inthe outside world in term s of the war or the continuedassaultsonthe Jews of  

Europe? Do youhaveany knowledge of  thisor there'sno way to know?
 

>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
W e heard certain things f iltering into
 
the ghetto,not very precise ex
a ctly wh a t 
happenedbut we knew som ething, Jews were being killed, being sentaway to concentration 

cam ps,f rom  Poland,f rom  Hungary, f rom  different parts of Europe. But we really didn't know 

exactly what happened. But we did hear backandforth certain things.
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
So you knew som e 
of  it. Ok.
 
 
Let's m ove
 
--
 
tim e is getting a little short. Let's m ove ahead to the end of the war. 
W hat happens with you when the Russians are advancing towardsyour town? Tell us about 

that.T he ghetto. Excuse me.
 

12
 
 
>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
Established in the outskirts of the housing with big f ields. So when the city was 
bombed,m an
y nights,we would run out to the outsideto thef ield and hide ina ditch.
 
One day, 
bombardm ents started to com e.T he city was bombedf orthree consecutive days.W e stayed 
in these trenche
s.
 
All of a sudden we heard it was quiet
. O
ne of  the person f rom the trenches 
looked out and said we are liberated. So we couldn't understand what happened. He said, 

ﬁL
ook out.
ﬂ 
So we saw in thef ar end of  thef ield there was individuals with gra y coats on, gray 
fur hat with the red stars on theirf oreheadand saidthese are Russians. So we were liberated 

in the spring of 1945 by the Russians. Inall this tim e we never heardf rom
 
m y f ather, by the 
wa y .
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
S t ill
 
and youhave no idea if  he'seven alive.
 
>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
Righ t .
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
So did you think about going back to thef arm  ordid you wait
 
--
 
t e ll u s  
when your dad came back.
 
>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
W e couldn't 
leave anywhere. My f ather
 
--
 
f irst of all,right af ter 1945, after the 
Russians cam e over, individuals started to com ebackf rom the same ghetto where they were 

sent out to slave labor cam ps. So everybody asked have you seen m y brother, m y f ather, this 

one
. So wef inally asked have you seenm y father. One individual said, yeah,the last tim eI 

saw him  was about am onth ago
; h
e was ingood healthand chances arehe was shipped to 
another cam p.
 
So we hoped if he saw him  am onthago, perhaps he's still alive. 
 
 
So later on, one day he just showed up. Hehitchhiked on Russian convoys, walked a 
lot,f arm ers. Hef inally came back tothe ghetto area.W e were there for a couple of days, 

m
aybe a week.T hen he saidto m e
 
we'll go back tothef arm  and see what happens to our 
f a rm .
 
 
So we went back.Before we went tothef arm , actually, we stoppedat an oldfarmer 
that helped us out to thank him  for the things that he did for us. The farm er invited us f
o r  l unc h .  
Af ter lunchhe said, ﬁW here are you going from here?
ﬂ 
H e  sa
id
 
--
 
m y father said we're going to 
see thefarm . He said, 
ﬁ
I wouldn't do that.
ﬂ 
He s a id ,  
ﬁW
hy not?ﬂ He said, ﬁB
e ca u s e t ha t ' s  not 
your f arm  anym ore.
ﬂ 
He said, 
ﬁW
hat  ha pp e ned  to t h e f a rm ?
ﬂ 
He said thefarm was divided into 
three. The priest and his fam ily g
ot a third of thefarm ,the policeand hisf am ily got a third of  
thefarm , and them ayor of  thetown got a third of thef arm . 
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
And the mayor.
 
>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
Yeah. For m any years af ter thatm y f atherand I spoke toeach other and said, 
W
hat makes people do what they do?W hy this old farmer risked his lif e to help us?W hy this 
priest who was supposed to really helppeople turnus inas Jews totheauthorities?W ecould 

never f igure itout. Finally we said it was becausem aybem onetary reas
on s  o r  s om et h i n
g that 
som ebody could benefit. Thefarmer did it becausehehad it inhis heart.T he priest did it 

because he saw opportunity and took it.
 
>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
And the samef orthe mayor and thepolice who oneexpect
 
--
 
like you have an 
expectati
onf oraf aith leader, you have an expectationfor law enf orcem entand government to 
look after people but not in this case.
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
Now, at the same tim e, we tried tof ind out whathappened to ourf am ily 
back in Hungary. So in March 1944, Germ any invaded Hungary. Between April
 
15, 1944, and 
J u ly
 
9, 1944,140,000Jews were deported to Hungary f rom Italy toAuschwitz. Among the 
240,000 were 33m embers ofmyf am ily, gran dparents,uncles, aunts, cousins. Andm ost of  

them  died.W edon't know where, when, or how. Only three people we knowf or a fact, m y 

grandfather and two of m y uncles who was in Auschwitz together attheend. My grandf ather 

13
 
 
dieda month bef ore liberation. He diedf rom  starvation. And two of my uncles survi ved. One 
was 21 years old, one
 
was 22 years old.T hey each weighed 65
 
pounds. So you can im agine 
what they looked likewhen you hear the words skin andbones or walking skeletons.T hat's 

what they were.
 
 
W hen the Red Cross cam e into the cam pand saw the condition these people were in, 
they tookthem  to Sweden, which was a neutral country. Between these two brothers, 

unf ortunately onedid notm ake it toSweden.He died onthe way to Sweden. So he was buried 

at sea. Andone did survi ve. He was in 
a 
Sweden hospital f or four years to get his strength and 
wei ght back. Finally he em igrated to the United States. And he's theuncle that cam e to Israel 

to visit. Hef inally did sponsor me to com e to the United States. He is theone that toldm e 

about thebirthdays that he had. Sof rom  33, im mediatefam ily, only one survi ved.
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
So you were ver y f ortunate. Fairly rare for survi vors tom aintainaf am ily. 
You had trem endous losses inthe extendedfam ily.
 
>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
Then we realized atthat pointthere'snofuturef orus to stay in 
Rom ania. So 
m y f atherappliedfor exit visa and theonly country thataccepted Jewish people at the tim e 

was Palestine.W eapplied atthe time to get an exit visa. Ever y tim e it came back denied,for 

m any years. Finally, the last chancem y f ather had,he knew an individual that he was dealing 

with in the Rom anianArm y. He said
, ﬁT h is is a ll I've  go t, ta ke it. P
lease give us anexit vis a.
ﬂ 
He did.Sof inally 1951 we lef tfor Israel.
 
In Israel, I served in the Israeli Arm y for three years. 
Finally cam e back to the United States.
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
D on ' t  b e s o
 
hum ble. Youwere wounded in combat.
 
>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
Yeah,ok. I was wounded. T hen they tookm eback.My m other was workin g as 
a nurse in thehospital. Shedidn't know I was wounded.They brought me back in
to tha t 

hospital.W hen she noticed that I'm  theone
 
--
 
>> W a rren  Ma rc u s :
 
She's working at the hospital taking incom ing wounded andthere's her 
son.
 
>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
Yeah.
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
Another unbelievable.
 
>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
Came to the
 
United States in1961. One thing whenI was reading about your 
lif e, you got to Israeland that was thef irst tim e you saw an orange.
 
>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
Right.Never saw oranges before. It was a cold country.
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
Besides how hard it was in the ghetto.
 
 
You know what? I think we'd like to endhere. Here's what we're goi ng to dof rom  here 
on in. Let's take tim e for some questions.Everything is ok for questions. W e'll have 

m icrophones. I'm  going to ask you to speak slowl y and keep it brief.W e'rehere to learn Nat'
s 
m em oriesand storiesfrom  his life. Andat theend we always gi ve our First Person the last 

word, closing word.
 
>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
I wouldlike to addone thing.
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
Please.
 
>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
I did get married. Ihave f ive children and12 grandchildren. Each individual of  
m y children andm y gr andchildrenare named for one of thesemurdered by the Nazis. My 

sister did the same thing. So allof  these people who perished have nam esafterthem . 
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
Thank you.
 
 
Ok. Does anyone have ques
tions? 
 
 
T hank you.
 

14
 
 
>>
 
T hanksf or your great story. Inthe years that yourf ather appliedfor the visa, theexit vis a, 
and you said ittook several years bef ore youf inally had to bribe som ebody
,  
what did your 
father do? How did you exist while you waited?
  
>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
Firstof all, we lef t the ghetto and we got ahouse. My father went back tothe 
farm area with the old farm er. He was able tobuy f rom him 30heads of  cattle, 30 cows. My 

father always used to tell these people when they cam e toaskfor a
 
loan f rom m y f ather and 
alwa ys said I don't know when I'm  going tobe abletopay you back.My f atheralways told 

th em , 
ﬁY
ou'll pay me back when you have it.
ﬂ 
Som y f ather toldhim I don't know when I can 
pay you back. Bothf arm ers said you'll pay me back
 
when you haveit. Sothat's little by little we 
startedto getback into the samef ield that they knew and producedsom e dairy but very littl e, 

on a very sm all scale.
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
By the way, Nat's had a very successful business career
. W
hat  a s h o c k,
 
huh? Af ter the black market.
 
 
Ok. Any other questions? Sonya? 
 
>>
 
You were talking about yourf atherduring the oneperiod of tim ewhen he was gone, 
assumedly to a concentration camp or they sent him  off som ewhere.Did 
he ever 
talk to youor 
tell you stories whenhe cam ebackabout where he was and whathe experienced inthat time 

that he was gone f rom your f am ily? 
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
He was slave labor.
 
>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
Right, slave labor cam p.They were laying railroad tracks between Romania 
and Russia sothe convo ys could continue going. So that was pretty hard labor and very little 

food. So obviously wh en he cam e back, hewas not the sam e. He lost a lot of weight. It was a 

slave labor cam p.
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
If orgot som ething I wanted tom ention. Can you
 
tell us, were you a very 
religious f am ily? Did itever change during these travails in term s of yourf aith?
 
>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
For us,ourf aith, we stayed the sam e.Inother words, we kept thefaithbecause 
that'stheonly thing we have to cling on.
 
 
Ju st  a
n example. Onetim e,one of thesefarmers puta ham  in oneof these bags that 
was thrown to m y father.W ecouldn'teat it because we kept kosher. Sothat was oneof  the 

things we traded. Thatwas a good thing to trade with. So we did keep ourfaith. Many 

u
nf ortunately did not. It was an individuality. Som e people did keep their faith. Some did not.
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
So that ham helped you.
 
>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
It helped.
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
Anyone else? 
 
>>
 
W hat was your greatest fear when you were in the ghetto? 
 
>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
Number one,to get sick. I was af raid if I get sick, chances are everything would 
go downhill f rom  thatpoint on. Obviously there's nothing I coulddo to stay healthy butthatwas 

one of  the fears. The other f ear is
,  
you know, what are we going to eat tom orrow
.  
Always a 
problem . Fam ine was a big problem  in the ghetto. Notenough to eat. And there was no 

m edication. So tomake sure m y m other survi ved to make sure I doever ything I possibly can 

thenext day. Soalways thinking of som ething what to do.
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
At the age of? 
 
>> N a t  S h af f i r :
9  
1/ 2 .
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
Ok. Just want to be clear.
 
>>
 
Hi. M y nam e isPatrick. I'm f rom Georgetown. T hank youf or sharing your story and 
experience in such vivid detail.
 

15
 
 
 
You suff ered trem endous hardshipat a very young age. You had to learn a lot really 
fast inthe ghetto. My question is, How did that experienceactually inform the way you 
conducted your life post liberation whether in Rom ania,Israel,or inthe UnitedStates? 
 
 
T hank you.
 
>> N a t  
S h af f i r :
 
Could you repeat the question?
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
You som ehow got through thesediff iculthardships. How has that inform ed 
your lif e since then? 
 
>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
Obviously I look at a com pletely diff erent prism. I see things, people, badand 
good. 
Mostof  thethings I always think on thepositive wa y. I alwa ys
 
--
 
one of  m y grandsons is 
9 years old.So last year I brought him  over here, also in oneof  these sessions, andI was 

wondering if  a child 9 years oldtoday can dowhat I did9 years old then.
 
Probably couldn't. So 
it's kind of hard
 u
nlessa person is inthat position
. 
 
 H
ow things changed in m y lif e, Ialwa ys try to helppeople outnom atter what.T hat's 
m y nature atthis point. AndI thinkm y sisters do the same thing. Because when we 
realized 

theoldfarm er risked his lif e tohelp us,the least we can do, humanity, is pay back somehow. I 

guess it made me abetter person.
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
Let's do two more. Maybe.
 
>>
 
Did you ever return or visit your farm again? 
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
D id  
you go back tothefarm ?
 
>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
W e went back one tim e. After that, since it was divid ed, we didnot.T herewas 
no reasonto gobackat this point.W e did getcom pensationf rom  the Rom anian governm ent, 

not really what thef arm  was worth by all m eans but some com pensation.
 
>>
 
Ho w old were you when you came to theU.S. and what were yourf irst im pressions when 
you cam e? 
 
>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
W henIcam e tothe United States, numberone, I came in as a visitor. My uncle 
sponsoredm e.W hen I saw Am erica, If ell in love like all the imm igrants do. IdecidedI want to 

st a y a
nd changed thevisa to resident,f inally got m y green cardand eventually became a 
citizen. I thinkthat's one of the greatest country that we li ve in. I'm  sure all the imm igrants that 

c o m e 
into this country believe the sam e way.
 
 
Actually, I'm one of the youngest survi vors. I'm  only 81 years old. Most of the survivors 
are in their 90s. So it's kind of hard, you know, tom ake sure what's happened to allof  these 

people. You get less and less of us alm ostevery m onth, som eof  t
h em  p
erish or pass away.
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
W hat year did you com e?
 
>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
I cam e in 1961. 
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
So you were 25. How's my m ath?25? 
 
 
I guess we cando some more. 
 
>>
 
W hat was one of the hardest things you suff ered through when you were in the ghettos? 
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
W hat was the worst
 
--
 
let's just say what was the worst thing
 
in
 
t he  ghe t t o  
for you?
 

>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
Probably when they took m yf ather away
 a
nd then al
l of  a sudden lef t on m y 
own, at thatage, 9 years old.T hat was probably one of the worst tim es.
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
Last one. How about here? 
 
>>
 
During the years when yourfather was awa y, what was your m otherdoing?W as shestill 
work as a nurse?W hat was she doing?
 
>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
Yeah, she was working
 
--
 
an exam ple what happened. She was working in the 
hospital cleaning up. Thenone of the children
 
--
 
all of  a sudden shewas cleaning next to the 

16
 
 
bedsand she saw one of the children,hisf ace, turn blue.
 
Shetried to call the nurse. In the 
m eantim e she tried to revi ve him . Sheactually did. It's a good thing that shedid when shedid 
because when thenurse cam e in, imm ediately they called the doctor andf inally revi ved the 

child. T hat child happened to be
 
the child of the police departm entoff icerf rom the city.W hen 
he saw what the mother did, heactually told the nurse, ﬁW hy is she cleaning thefloors a
nd th e  

toilets? She should be the nurse.
ﬂ 
And sheactually was upgraded to anassistant nurse or 
s o m et h
ing like that. So because she saved
 
--
 
so som etim es luck has a good im pacton what 
happens
 
--
 
theoutcome of  whathappens to individuals.
 
>> W a rren Ma rc u s :
 
Ok.W e're going to wrap up the questions.W e're almostdone.
 
Here's what 
I want to tell.W hen we're done, there will be tim e
 
--
 
Nat will stick arounda little while. If  you 
want to com eup, shake his hand, give him  ahug, take apicture. So we'll ge
t to  
that in a 
m inute.
 
 
It's our tradition, as I said, of
 
F i rs t  P e rs on
, togi ve our First Person the last word. So 
Nat,f inal words for our guest
s 
today?
 
>> N a t  S h af f i r :
 
Many people inm any countries kept silent what happened in the Holocaust 
years, the atrocities com m itted.T hey say silence is golden but not when it com es to atrocities 

like that.W e need to speakout. It'sour duty andour responsibility to humanity, for all of us, to 

speakout soatrocitieslike this will never happenagain.
 
 
T hank you.
