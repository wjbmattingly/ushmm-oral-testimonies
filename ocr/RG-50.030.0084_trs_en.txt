TECHNICAL CONVERSATION  

 

Q: To start off with, uh we would like for you 
to give us your name  and where you were born 
and when you were born, and tell us a little
 bit...OK...na me , address and where you were 
born– 
 

A: OK. Na me  a nd address, where I was born. My 
name is Werner Goldsmith. Originally it was 
Goldschmidt (ph). That's the German equi
valent of Golds mith. So it was Werner 
Goldschmidt in German and of course I've ang
licized it to Werner Goldsmith, shortly after 
my arrival in the United States in the uh fall of 1941. Uh I was born in the city of Erfurt, E - 

F - U - R - T, which today is in what used to
 be the German Democratic Republic, soon to 
be the Reunited Germany. It's the province of Sa
ringia (ph). Uh major ci
ty in Saringia (ph), 
the ma jor city in Saringia of about ove
r two hundred thousand population. Uh about one-
third the si ze of Wa shington, if you will. 
 

Q: And tell us a little bit about what– 

 

A: Oh, my date of birth...I was born on the 
13th November, 1928, in the city of Erfurt. 
 

Q: And then tell us a little bit a
bout what you reme mber from your youth. 
 

A: Quite a bit from my youth. Now the early year
s, as I say, the infant
 years and the toddler 
years, naturally who can reme mber those years,
 which means the first four years one doesn't 
reme mber anything or hardly anything. Somy reme mbrance starts roughly in 1933 I 

suppose which is also the beginning, as chance w
ould have it, of the Third Reich and uh so 
that's  when my uh thinking starts, and as 
I think back on 1933 and 
1934, I cannot think of 
anything unpleasant that happened 
to me in those early years. 
 

Q: Do you remember going to school– 

 

A: No. In '33 a nd '34 I was n't  in school ye
t. This was pre-school. I mean this was... 
 

Q: Let's go on to where your parents– 

 

A: Uh I was in kindergarten and I had no unpl
easant experiences in ki ndergarten. This would 
be around 1934. In 1935 I started school in Erfu
rt, a school called the Schiller (ph) Schule 
(ph) or the Sc hiller School on 
Schiller Street, Schiller Plaza,
 and this is where I started 
school in uh around Easter time , 1935. Uh what
 do I reme mb er there?  The first year, 1935, 

not too unpleasant. 1935. 1936 uh things started to 
deteriorate as far as
 Jewish people were 
concerned and the Third Reich and it became le
ss pleasant in the classr oom. I was the only 
Jewish boy in the in the classroom.–

Q: Do you remember any incidents that–you say it became less pleasant... 
 

A: Well, there were a few times when I  was 
hit. OK. But uh it wa sn't  assault and battery 
exactly. I mean I was dealt with
 in a rude, crude sort of fa
shion but I wasn't  actually uh 
beaten to the ground or anythi
ng like that, but there uh were
 some  very curt, unpleasant 
behavior. My parents decided to take me  out
 of public school and put me  in a private 

school, which they did, and I spent uh 1937 to
 '3 8...anyway in 1937 I was in private school. 
I never got a chance to really attend gy mnasiu
m which I qualified for, the German college 
prep school, because in 1938 all Jews were 
driven from the schools...be they faculty, 
teachers, admi nistrative personnel, students,
 pupils, young, old...all Jewish people in in the 
school system was re mo ved so that ended my 
official schooling in in in Germany, in the 
Third Reich. 
 

Q: Did...how...how about during this period...can you tell
 us a little about your fa mily life, your 
father, your mother...  
 

A: My father was a wholesale salesman, textile sa
lesman. Did a lot of travel ing in the pr ovince 
of Saringia and the province of Hefner (ph), wh
ich adjoins it to the west. He was gone a lot 
of the time, so I was really...it was my mother re
ally that was in charge
 ninety percent of the 
time, as I reme mber, because he was gone on his uh business, and so she was running the 

home  and she was running me  and very nicely
 I mi ght say. I had no complaints. I was an 
only child and I would say I was spoiled, at leas
t the landlady in in 
in my building, who's 
still alive, she consider ed me very
 mu ch a spoiled child. Spoiled brat. 
 

Q: Do you remember any of your friends or– 

 
A: I reme mber a few, very very slim fe w little children of which I was one of them and uh 
these were friends. In fact in my in my fa m
ily album there are some photos of myself and a 
few of my c hildhood friends. My mother took photos
 and uh so they survive in pictures to 
this day. But uh I can't  reme mber a hell of a 
lot. It uh...what I reme mber wasn't ...my home 
life was not unpleasant. I I can't  say...I, in my 
me moir I pointed out that I had a...my my my 
mother and my father both tried as much as 
possible within within 
their hu man means to 
insulate me fr om the incr easingl y unpleasant situation for the Jewish people in Germany in 
the Third Reich which became with, year to year, came in a descending spiral and they 

insulated me  as much as possible and gave me
 a fairly normal home life and fairly decent 
life and so I, until 1938, things really were not
 too bad. I do reme mber quite vividl y though 

on a number  of occasions going to school, sti
ll to the old public school. There were the 
Hitler youth, uniformed Hitler yout
h, and these were of course the advance, the advance 
guard of youthful Hilterites and they were were
 just only too anxious, 
to willing to beat up 
on a youngster who was not in uniform, because
 a youngster not in uniform of a Hitler 
youth or a Young Pioneer meant one of two things
. Either he belonged to a fa mily that was 
anti-Hitlerean (ph) and didn't want
 their child to be a Hitler 
youth, or he wa s a Jew or gypsy, 
and if they say a child who was not uniforme
d, he  imme diately was to be attacked. So I 
reme mber as much as possible of keeping cl
ear of the Hitler youth (l
aughter), even seeing 
them a block away would usually mean that I 
would walk in the opposit
e direction and so I 
I ma naged quite well uh to keep out of their, 
out of their uh clutches as much as possible.

Q: You me ntioned this wasn't  until 1938... 

 

A: Until 1938. By 1938 of course I no longer was in
 school, since all Jews were out of the 
school, German school, and by then also, early 
1938, my father died. Heart condition, very 
ill for hi s fina l six months and so on. Luckily he
 di ed because he never would have survived 
the trip to uh Buchenwald concentration camp 
and so on. So he died and uh my mother and 
I then moved shortly thereafte r, not immediately, shortly th
ereafter we moved to Berlin, 
which as things proved to be a very sensible 
move. Had we rema ined in Erfurt neither she 
or I would ha ve survived the Holocaust. By m
oving to Berlin we moved into a milleure (ph) 
that enabled her to make contact which enable
d enabled her eventually to pl ace me  with a 
children's transport for France, and enabled her 
as a widow eventually to get to England and 
so we both survived by probably for two r
easons, moving to Berlin, numbe r one, and her 
incessant efforts to get us out of that. You s
ee, my father, as I reme mber him, always was 
like many other German Jews...he felt that th
ese these uh wild el
ements, these Nazi 
elements, would never be able to capture th
e whole power. They would never be able to 
descent to what they descended into. And so 
he always had this optimistic view, and he 
couldn't get himself to leave Germany. To
 him Germany was his home and he had no 
intention of leaving. My moth
er would have left Germany 
in 1935 if he had been willing. 
But anyway, we rema ined in Germany, and fi nally she was a widow in '3 8. We  were in 

Berlin. Her incessant work finally enabled me  to
 get to France with a transport of kids and 
she, as a widow, eventually to England and thus she saved both our lives. 
 

Q: So then in 1938 you were separated fr om your mother, is that when it happened? 

 

A: In 1938 we moved to Berlin from Erfurt
. I was not separated. In 1939, in 1939 I was 
separated from my mother, when I was associat
ed with this transport of children. All the 
children said goodbye on the train platform. For ma
ny, for all the children 
in fact, it was the 
last time they saw their their parents, becau
se all these ma rried uh folks, these ma rried 
couples, they couldn't get out. That's it. Most of
 these children saw...for
 most of these kids 
on this transport, around thirty
-nine children, thirty-e
ight of them said goodbye for the final 
time to their parents on that train platfor m, ta
king us to France. By mother being a widow 
ma naged to get to England. She survived. 
 

Q: OK. Now let's go back to 1938. You moved to Berlin. 

 

A: Right. We  moved to Berlin. 

 

Q: Now...once you're in Berlin...let's, let's go 
over what happened there.
 I'm a little little 
unclear. 
 

A: In Berlin my  mother had me placed for t
hose months...I don't know whether it was at the 
very beginning, but I know I was there for a num
ber of months to the end in Berlin, she 
placed me  with an or phanage called the Awe rbuch (ph) Orphanage. Awerbuch. OK. And uh 

– 
 

U S HMM  A r chiv es  RG-5 0.0 30* 008 4 
4 
 
Q: Was it basically a Jewish orphanage? 
 

A: Oh it was a Jewish orphanage. Oh yes. In in
 '38, Jews were not permitted to associate with 
Aryans. Oh no. That would have been abso...oh disaster for the Jews. And uh so uh this was 

a Jewish children's home. I can't  say that al
l the children there were orphans. I wasn't  an 
orphan, yet I was accepted by Awerbuch and 
there were other children who had 
fa milies...uh par...parents, both parents alive 
and they were accepted by Awerbuch. In other 
words, I think this Awerbuch home accepted chil
dren whether they were orphans or not, 
because it was felt that in this orphanage they had some kind of a refuge from what was 

happening on the streets of Berlin to Jews 
who were being beaten and trampled on and 
kicked upon, and with the police looking the other way if they happened to be there. The 

situation by 1938 was getting out of hand. And late
 '38 you had this infamous Night of the 
Breaking Kristall (ph), Kr istallnacht it was calle
d in German, and uh that's when they really 
went went amuck, ran amuck, the Nazis. When 
they attacked the synagogues and set uh fire 
to the synagogues, smas hed the Jewish shops
, vandalized everything 
they could lay their 
hands on, beat adults and children when when
ever they found some one be cause by that time 
adults and children above the age of ten I think 
or twelve, I'm not sure, had to have a Jewish 
star so you immediately could id
entify who was Jewish and who wasn't. S o you were living 
in in a terrible uh nightmare 
by 1938, but us being in that home , around the clock, we were 
spared these outrages on Krista
ll...Kristallnight, which was ri
ght in late November...uh, not 
not...early November, early Novemb er 1938. Uh– 
 

Q: Shortly after that 
you were put on a train... 
 

A: Well, uh then it was 1939. Another month mo
re passed. Months more passed, and again I 
was in this Awerbuch home , with lots of other 
kids, Jewish kids. And as I say, Nazis did not 
invade this Awerbuch home . 
We  found ourselves sort of living like in a, like on a 
plantation, sort of immu nized from the out
side, with the outsid
e being a jungle, a 
developing jungle and we were 
in this Awerbuch home  and uh so we were there during the 
early months of '39. Things uh like I've 
read about the pa...you know, looking back upon 
things, things got from bad to worse and from
 worse to even worse and but in the Awerbuch 
home  things were relative ly quiet and safe b
ecause we stayed in that home. We didn't set 
foot outside for very sensible
 reasons. And uh finally in th
e summer of '39, the transport 
was for med. My mother had succeeded in getting 
me admitted to this transport and uh that's 
how I, along with thirty-eight other children, one
 fine summer day left 
on this train ride to 
France. I should also point out that in the year
 1938 to '39, my mother lived with a Jewish 
lady as her uh sub-tenant. In other words, she 
lived with a Jewi sh lady on Hector Strasa (ph) 
in Berlin, West Berlin, un the western part of 
Berlin. At that time, of course, Berlin was a 
unified city and on Hector Strasa 21 my mother
 lived with a Jewish lady whose sub-tenant 
she was. I can't really tell you what wo
rk she did. I really can't tell you. 
 

Q: OK. Then you were put on the transport– 

 

A: Yeah. The kids went on the transport, said 
goodbye to their parents on the platform and for 
all of them except one, my mother, was the last  
time they saw their pare
nts, because they all 
died in the Holocaust, these these parents. Child
ren left for Fr ance and then we arrived in a 

U S HMM  A r chiv es  RG-5 0.0 30* 008 4 
5 
 
place called Cassie (ph)  __________, ma ybe fifteen 
to twenty miles southeast of Paris, 
where a French nobleman, Count _______ formed a uh children's home for us thirty-nine 
children. He had previously formed a  home  for probably an equivalent number of Spa nish 

girls from Republican Spain. Spanish Republican 
refugee girls were also quartered, not in 
the same  building but in a near-by building, al
so one of ______'s charitable enterprises. And 
so this is where we lived and it seemed at th
e time that this wa s our refuge, our port in a 
developing storm. Of course, like
 history tells us, things didn't rema in so quiet and the port 
in the storm wasn't  a port for very long. For for less than a year it was a port uh a port in a 

storm. While I was at uh this 
this home  of Monsieur _____ in 
Cassie, just a few weeks later 
I got a letter suddenly from E
ngland. I didn't know a soul in E
ngland. I, but I recognized the 
handwriting. A letter from my mo
ther. She told me  she had arri
ved in in in England and and 
was working for a fa mily in Leatherhead (ph)
 in the outskirts of 
London and and so I knew 
at that point that she was out, I was out 
and things looked pretty good at the time. 
 

Q: Can you tell us a little bit a
bout your life in th
is Fr ench place? 
 

A: Well, was...we were all Jewish
 children, but it wa sn't  a Jewi
sh life. Uh our counselors and 
teachers were not Jewish. Our benefactor wasn
't  Je wish. Uh we were not...we had no kosher 
cuisine. We  had no Jewish rules and regulations. There was no Jewish instruction or 

anything. We led a uh totally non-Jewish assimi latio
nist (ph) type of lif
e. Uh and I, like I 
state in my me moir, my  guess is that most of 
the kids in the transport to this home came  
from assimilationist uh German-Jewish homes. 
There were no religious
 people that I can 
reme mber there among the kids. We all seemed to 
take to this secular type of life at Cassie 
rather easily. We  seeme d to fit 
in very very nicely. I should also me ntion in in retrospect 
that my own parents did not have a very uh...di
d not run a religious home. My father came  
from very deeply religious parents, but he hi
ms elf did not follow a deeply religi...religious 
life although he did go to schul
e (ph) on the religious holiday
s and participated in the 
services. My mother not at all, 
and so I reme mber not living in a in a really Jewish type of 
home. We were living a assimila
tionist type of secular home... 
 

Q: What activities did you have th
ere?  Did you have classes?  Di d you... 
 

A: Now we we are back again now in Cassie...our activities were...we had uh French class. We  
learne d French. I reme mber very well one
 of our teachers was a White Russian who 
pounded us (laughter)...verbs and syntax. I reme mber very well...Madame Richter, R - I - C 

- H - T - E - R, a Russian uh émigré from St. Petersburg for all I know. Maybe even a 

me mber of the uh royal courts for all I know. Uh
 anyway uh ma ybe an instructress to some  
of the uh Russian uh nobleme n, one-time noble men in St. Petersburg, and uh anyway 

Madame  Ri chter, she really pounded French into us
. I reme mber that to this to this day and 

uh we had other French teachers and uh émigré teachers and uh...how shall I put it...uh 

teachers and uh counselor s...that's the word I'm looking for, counselors...and none of them 

Jewish and so, as I say, it was a secular 
atmosphere and we played and we had our 
instruction. We had our three 
meals a day. If there was anyt
hing lacking it was parental 
love. That that was mi ssing. 
 

Q: OK. That's a n important ingredient...  

U S HMM  A r chiv es  RG-5 0.0 30* 008 4 
6 
 
 
A: Yeah. That's  one of the tragedies of my life
...at this key period of 
my life, suddenly in 1939 
my parental link was cut off, because receiv
ing an occasional letter from my mother in 
England is hardly a substitute for really 
living in one's home  with one's parents. 
 

Q: Now how long were you in 
this area, in this camp? 
 

A: In this children's home ...it wasn't  a camp...c
hildren's home?  From uh summer of '39 until the 
fall of France in the summer of '40. Roughly 
a year I was in this 
Cassie ______, children's 
home of Monsieur...
the Count of _______. 
 

Q: Tell me  wha t  happened af
ter the fall of France?  
 

A: Well, he was a high French officer. Was taken 
prisoner. The last we heard was that uh he 
was some where in Germany. The finances of 
the home went from mediocre to bad, from 
bad to worse. It became  obvious that the home 
had to be closed, and that's when the Oeuvre 
de Secours aux Enfants of France, this Jewish
 welfare organization for children, entered the 
picture. As the Oeuvre de Secours aux Enfants
...well that's...I translate that as the Child's 
Welfare Organization...Children's We lfare Aid 
Society...there are any number of ways you 
can translate that name . In French it's  O -E - U 
- V - R - E, that's one word...D ª E, is another 
word...S - E - C - O - U - R - S, is another word...uh A - U - X, still another word, and the 

final word, enfants, E - N - F - A - N - T - S, which by the way means children. OK. So this 

uh...oh, by by the way...it was always called for short by it's acronym of OSE, OSE, by it's 

initials... O - S - E. 
 

Q: So OSE took over at that time... 
 
A: OSE took over as this uh enterprise failed, we
nt...I mean we nt bankr
upt. Uh prior to its 
bankruptcy of course, we tried 
to flee south, and we fled s
outh with thousands of other 
people...we were on the road...as the German ar
mies approached Paris from the northeast, 

we were on our way to the southeast, by coal 
barge and then on foot traveling south, trying 
to go south. Everybody, lots of Jews on the 
roads I would imagine, but also other 
Frenchme n, all, everybody heading south to 
evade the appr oaching 
uh Teutonic hoard. Uh 
in other words they had broken through the ma rg
inal (ph) line, the so-called impregnable 
ma rginal line which held on for months a
nd mont hs in the so-called ______. They had 
broken through and were rapidly approaching Pa ri
s, and that's when you had this helter 
skelter rush to the sout h. And we joined the 
rush. Our teachers and counselors told us we'll 
go south and hopefully we'll get there. We ll,we didn't get there. We  were (laughter)...
  
  
 

Q: Do you remember some thing a
bout that trip...what happened– 

 

A: Everything down to the last detail– 

 

Q: Well, tell us, tell us more about that...  

 

U S HMM  A r chiv es  RG-5 0.0 30* 008 4 
7 
 
A: One night we spent on a coal barge going 
up the Seine, not down the Seine, but up the 
Seine. And if you know t he Seine, it meanders
 like that and going up 
it is not only slow, it 
was painfully slow, extremely slow. We ma de 
very little progress and and finally during uh 
one fine mor ning, the fine morning after a night
 on the barge...the barge was empty and we 
and the other people were on that barge sleep
ing, or trying to slee
p...and one fine morning, 
uh the fine morning afterwards, after having 
boarded it, the barge, came upon thousands or 
hundreds at least other barges all stuck in th
e sand. They were barring each other's way. 
There were barges and barges and barges, so 
we simply got out of our barge and continued 
the trip south on foot, carrying our our belongin
gs like thousands of ot
her people. Traveling 
on foot the road south. 
 
Q: With your teachers and... 

 

A: Everybody along, on foot, carrying belongings, 
our belongings...suitcases, knapsacks, you 
name it. 
 

Q: How how long did this go on? 

 

A: All day long. When we got off the barge in 
the morning to to...it was evening time. We got 
to this farmhouse. We  uh on on this...I call it 
the famous road that where I came face to face 
with the face (ph) of ________, because uh we were on on the road between the town of 

Corbeil, C - O - R - B - E - I - L on the north, an
d the town of Melun (ph) in which direction 
we were mo ving or walking, M - E - L - U - N,
 between Corbeil and 
Melun on this on this 
third-rate country road, ma ybe 
second-rate country road...it cer
tainly wasn't  a first-rate 
highway...walking south and we came to this 
farmhouse and we decided, or our counselors 
decided...we didn't, kids didn't decide anythi
ng... teachers and counselors decided we we re 
going to spend the night at the farmhouse and th
at's  where we spent, in the barn, in the 
straw, we spent the night in the farmhouse a
nd I reme mber vividly all night long there was 
pounding of cannon fire in the forest of Fountai
nbleu (ph), in the well-know forest of 
Fountainbleu, cannons were firing and bang, bang, 
bang...all night long. It
 was very difficult 
to sleep. I got very little shut-eye. And so in
 the morning it finally got silent. Suddenly the 
the the firing stopped and and uh things got very
 silent. Also I should me ntion some  French 
troops, ma ybe a platoon of Frenchmen, uh joined us
 in the hay in that uh in that French 
far mhouse and slept there or trie
d to sleep. Early in the morni
ng they packed up and left to 
the south I guess. (laughter) We  stayed on fo
r breakfast. As I said, in the morning it had 
gotten very quiet, eerily quiet, eeri
ly still, and so as we finish
ed breakfast some  of us went 
out to the road, to th
e shoulder of the road and there we
re some, some fa rmers, French 
peasants standing there talking. The big crow
d of people, the ma sses of pe ople that had 
been the previous day walking, cluttering th
e road up, walking with their belongings down 
the road...all gone. The road was empty. Nothing moved on the road. Just a few far me r s on 

the side of the road and a few children finish
ing breakfast early, movi
ng to the shoulder of 
the road, and I heard one French farmer yelli
ng into the tiny village down the road, north, 
uh what's going on now, what's what's happeni
ng?  Words to that effect. And then the 
answer was shouted back, ____________. Translation...
the Krauts have arrived. And that's  
what, that's what it was. Well, you can see al
ready the tension was was rising among us. We  
didn't know what to expect. Anyway, the farmer
s stayed there on the 
shoulder of the road.

The kids stayed on the shoulder of the road. A 
few mi nutes later, noise. Motorized troops of 
the German Wehr macht were comi ng down the road, zooming right by us. As they zoomed 
by us, our hearts once again grew lighter a
nd we  began to breath again. We had no idea 
what would face us because there were rumors fr
om the east, that is eastern Europe, that the 

German We hrmacht could be brutal as they were
 in the east, but in France, in the west of 
Europe, at this stage of the war, they weren'
t so brutal. They simply zoomed down the road 
and left us people standing there. They ha
d no idea who was standing there...kids, some  
French adults, farmers...zoomed right along dow
n the road and we were once again within 
the confines of the Third Reich. Our flight 
to the south had ended, so what we do our 
counselor decided, counselors decided to move ri
ght back where we came from, back to our 
home  at Cassie _____ and so slowly we ma r...wal
ked back on the roads (laughter), the way 
we came, only this time not by barge, simply
 on foot and we ma r...uh wal ked and the whole 
place...as I reme mber France at that time  
was in a state of total discombobulation...you 
didn't know what was going on. (Laughter) I m
ean everything was in a state of uh 
suspended animation. So we walked home . Nothing befell us. I mean we s a w Ger mans 

along the road, supply, supply tr
oops. Nobody bothered us. To them we were just some  
French kids walking along. Nothing. No pr
oblem. French civilians. Nobody bothered us. 
We just walked back to our home and uh and th
at's  the way our flight to the south ended, 
exactly nowhere. We  we re right back where we
 came from...a t at Cassie and the home  was, 

as I say, going from bad to worse financially a
nd then, as I also pointed out previously, the 
OSE stepped in and then there were about thir
ty-nine kids and then 
they moved a number of 
kids here and a number of kids there, a number 
of kids there. We were divided all over the 
place. 
 

Q: You were disbursed. 

 
A: Disbursed. Pr ecisely. OK. And with three other 
kids, with three other kids, four of us, were 
disbursed to the Rothschild Orphanage in Pa
ris. Four of us wound up in the Rothschild 
Orphanage in Paris. Others wound up in Char
bon (ph) at that time. Others wound up in 
_______, which were at that time Vichy France, 
the unoccupied zone, and uh various other 
places. I have no idea.  
 
Q: So then you ended up in...  

 

A: I ended up with three kids 
at the orp...Rothschild Orphanage
 for nine mo nths, a period 
which I reme mber very clearly. I got older by th
is time. (laughter) And uh I found mys e lf in 
a French Jewish orphanage, run by the Rothsch
ild organization. OSE took us there but they 
weren't involved at that time . 
It was the Rothschild people. 
 

Q: Tell us what happened while you were
 there, at the Rothschild home . 
 

A: Well, at the Rothschild ho me, once agai
n we were learning French uh because the 
Rothschild orphans, French orphans, had uh Fr
ench instruction by c
ounselors there, by 
teachers, and uh so once again I found myself
 getting school instruction, which had been 
kind of spotty because of these events that were
 taking place, the flight and the collapse of 

the home and so on. Uh our instruction was 
beginning to get kind of
 uh sparse, so once 

U S HMM  A r chiv es  RG-5 0.0 30* 008 4 
9 
 
again at the Rothschild orphanage I was in 
a regular schoolroom, classroo m atmosphere 
again learning French again. And uh that's  what
 took place there. We ...I reme mber that our 
food was regular, three meals a day, but very spar
se. I must say that I never could say after 
getting up from a meal at the Rothschild Orpha
nage that I wa s satisfied. I was counting the 
hours, the mi nutes, to the next meal. From meal
 to meal, you lived from meal to meal and 
neither meal, not one single meal left us real
ly full. It was always hungry before the meal, 
still hungry after the meal, looki
ng forward to the next meal, but everything otherwise went 
perfectly normal, stable. Nobody bothered us 
at the orphanage and ____ we were cut off 
from the outside developments and uh I can't  
really say that I had any uh unpleasant uh 
experiences at the orphanage. 
 
Q: What about your other activities, uh 
other than school at the orphanage? 
 

A: At the orphanage...kids played in the yard a
nd that's it. Among themselves the kids played 
and had school. That's about all we did. 
 

Q: Come  back to the...  

 

A: Occasionally the counselor or teacher woul
d take us to the near-by uh ________, that's the 
_____ uh wood. In other words that's a city park if
 you will, city forest , city park and uh it's 
a very well-known uh park in Paris... 
 

Q: Youme ntionedthatthis
 was a Jewish orphanage...  
 

A: This was a Jewish orphanage...  

 
Q: Were you treated differently 
than in previous Cassie...  
 
A: Not not really. Not really. Although our teachers
 at the uh orphanage, 
there must have been 
some Jewish teachers there. I coul dn't say w
ho was Jewish and who wasn't , but again it was 
not kosher. It wasn't  that ther
e was no religious services and this was a Rothschild home. A 
Rothschild orphanage, which had existed for 
who knows how ma ny years. It was not a...I 
did not it a a religious
 Jewish atmosphere.  
Q: Chronologically we'r e now in 1940...  

 

A: We are now in '40 and uh '40, right. We are 
now in in summe r  of '40 when I wound up at 
this...with three others from our home in Ca
ssie...wound up uh in Paris at the Rothschild 
Orphanage.  
 

Q: How ma ny people, how ma ny children were, woul
d you say were at this 
Rothschild home  at 
this time?  
 

A: How ma ny?  I couldn't say for sure, but I w
ould guess that ma ybe...well, sixty at most. I 
couldn't say whether there were more more th
an sixty. I didn't have the impression there 
were more than sixty.  
Q: OK. And you weren't bothered in
 any way by the authorities?   

U S HMM  A r chiv es  RG-5 0.0 30* 008 4 
1 0 
 
 
A: No. I couldn't  say that either. While I wa
s at the orphanage, one fine day a gentleme n 
appeared and wanted some  questions from me . 
And so I answered him whatever I could and 
he identified himself as working for the In
ternational Red Cross. What had happened was 
that my mot her had gotten very worried about
 what happened to her son during the fall of 
France, obviously. And she had gotten in cont
act with the Internat
ional Red Cross in 
Geneva and tried to find by hook 
or crook what happened to her little We rner. And so uh 
this gentlema n finally found his way to the Roth
schild Orphanage in the summer of 1940, or 
ma ybe it was by that time autumn of 1940, and he
 asked me  questions about myself a nd so 
forth and I answered and at this point my 
mother once again had for her own incessant 
activity found out what had happened to me , wher e I was and that I had found a safe port in 

a storm, once again, so once again she she knew where I was. But of course there was no 

way of writing to her because France was 
occupied, most of France was occupied  
except for Vi chy France, allied to the rest of
 the Nazis and and so 
England at war and so 
there was no correspondence between us. But at 
least she knew that I had safely survived 
the fall of France and that I was at the Roth
schild Orphanage in Paris on the Rue La ______ 
in southeast Paris. That's  where I was. Four of us.  
 

Q: Let's go from there...what 
happened to you subsequently? 
  

A: That's  when the OSE, thankfully, entered 
the picture again. In uh...sometime in the summer 
or ma ybe it was spring...I would say late spring 
of 1941, the four of us, these four German-
Jewish refugees among the rest of the French 
Jewish orphans who were not, not affected by 
this move of the OSE...the OSE entered the picture once again and pulled us out of the 

Rothschild Orphanage, after having...us having 
spent nine months there. Suddenly the OSE 
entered the picture and pulled us out of there 
and moved us to southern France, to Vi chy 
France... 
 

Q: This was just the four Germans... 

 

A: Just the four German-Jewish refugee kids. 
You see, we were the ones most at risk. The 
German, that is the French Jewish orphans were
 not at this point most
 at risk. Thei r turn 
came later, as we shall soon see, but we were 
at most risk and the OSE took us four out of 
there and moved us to unoccupied Vi chy France
. Two of us four went
 to Marseilles (ph), 

one of the OSE home s there and 
the other two went to Charb
on (ph), another one of the uh 
OSE home s, and so that's uh what happened to us
 in the spring of '41. At that time  I had no 
idea why we were being moved, wha t  really wa
s the significance of 
that move, nothing of 
the kind. All I knew is we were move d. In 
1952, finally, long after the war, seven years 

after the war, I found out on my own...I was sta
tioned with the U.S. Ar my in We st Germany 
and I took a three-day pass to Paris. I wanted
 to find out...wanted to ma ke a visit to the 
orphanage, fi nd out what had happened. I ma de 
my way to Paris. I ma de my way along the 
Rue ______. I found the grey walls (crying ?), th
e iron gate, the concierge opening, the little 
portal (crying?) and I identified myself. She to
ld me  that the orphanage was closed, no one 
here, just the walls, the grounds and so I iden
tified myself that I had been there seven 
years...no, more than seven years...back in 1941, 
uh eleven years earlie
r I had been one of 
the children there for a while, so she told me  that uh in 1941 when the ______, in the 

U S HMM  A r chiv es  RG-5 0.0 30* 008 4 
1 1 
 
summer of '42 took place, about 
a year after we had been removed from the orphanage, the 
_______, when the French police under the urging of the Gestapo, descended upon any 
Jewish child, especially orphans and and re
fugees and others too, descended upon them on 
the 16th and 17th of July of '42...they desce
nded upon the Rothschild Orphanage and the old 

concierge lady there, the gate
keeper, building keeper, grounds 
keeper...told me  that during 
that summer of '42 the entire orphanage, chil
dren, staff, you name  it from Monsieur Cohan 
(ph), the director, on down, deported to Dran
cy, the holding camp and the only destination 
after Drancy by cattle car was to the extermination camps in eastern Europe, so what had 

happened was that the children left, the French
 Jewish orphans left at the Rothschild 
orphanage, were deported in 1942, the summer of
...July of '42. Had the four of us stayed 
another year, little over a year
 in the Rothschild Orphanage, 
I wouldn't be sitting in this 
chair here. We would have been...who knows...gas chambers.  
 

Q: OK. Let's come  back, let's come  back...  

 

A: I left that Rue _____ really shaken because at  that point I knew how close I had gotten to 
being exterminated. Anyway that was 
1952. That's getting ahead of our story.  
 

Q: Uh I want to pull you back to 1942, so you you left the Rothschild home and you were 
taken to... 
  

A: Yeah, two of us to Marseille (ph), where on
ce again we found ourselves
 in in a large home  
of of kids, Jewish kids, refugee kids, orphan 
kids, ma ybe some French Jewish kids. I have 
no...I have no idea. I was too young to ma ke a a su
rvey at that time. This kind of thing I can 
do easily in retrospect but at th
e time I was a youngster and this 
is not the kind of thing that 
uh I could do at the time, or did do. And othe
r, two other kids, the other two from the  
orphanage wound up in Charbon (ph). They too s
ubsequently survived the war. But I can 
report that the other fellow from the  orphanage 
and myself who went to Marseille, both of 
us survived the war in 1941. Uh that same  year
 we arrived in Marseill
e, we were both lucky 
enough to be assigned to a transport destined 
ultima tely for immigration to the United 
States. Why?  Because we  had relatives living 
in the United States. This was the decision 
that got us into the transport for the U.S. Had 
I not had relatives living in the U.S. I wouldn't 
be sitting here perhaps. No guarantee that I 
wouldn't have come  here ultima tely uh because 
the other two kids at Charbon, the other two from the original four, didn't have relatives in 

the U.S., and they also survived the war, one of
 who is in the U.S., the other one in Canada, 
so I can't  say that if I had not ma de that tr
ansport to the U.S. in 1941, once again with OSE 
taking an important...playing an im
portant role in that, uh I ca
n't say that I wouldn't have 
survived the war, but chances 
are fifty-fifty, but th
is way my  my problems were soon to be 
over. 
 

Q: Did you know you had relatives in the United States? 

 

A: Oh yes, yes, yes. Vaguely. I mean I I didn't have the details but I...  

 

Q: Did you know who they were? 

 

U S HMM  A r chiv es  RG-5 0.0 30* 008 4 
1 2 
 
A: I didn't have addresses, but I knew that I ha
d some  relatives. I knew I had an uncle there and 
and so on and as a...also a cousin. I also ha
d a cousin who was a physician uh living in in 
New York, and so I knew vaguely about their pr
esence but uh it wasn't
 a close relationship 
uh... 
 
Q: OK. You...s o this is 1942. Now you said... 

 

A: No, 1941. In '42 I was in the U.S. safe and sound. (laughter) 

 

Q: You, you...how did you...you got on a transport and who put you... 

 

A: Well, this OSE home  and the two of us at th
is OSE home in Marsei lle at this time still 
unoccupied Vichy France which within a year
 was also occupied by the Germans. In 
Nove mber '42 they occupied the rest of France.
 And anyway, so in 1941, that is summer of 
'41, we, we two, the two of us...Zomi e  (ph) wa
s his name  and myself, We rner Goldschmidt, 
_____, to give our full name s, we found ourselves 
added to this transport of kids, ma ny of 
them refuge es from Germany, with relatives in th
e U.S. I can't say that we all were refugees 
from Ger ma ny. There may have been some  
refugees from Austria, from Holland, who 
knows. I couldn't say. Anyway, once again it 
was a transport. I I couldn't tell you how 
ma ny...maybe twenty-five, thirty children...  
 

Q: When you say transport, you're talking about ...  

 

A: A group of children. A group of children be
ing taken under guided es
cort uh guided escort 
to Marseille where we waited for quite a numbe
r of days to get our emergency uh uh visas 
to the U.S. We waited there in Marseille uh and finally we got them from the American 
Consulate Ge neral in Marseille...uh we got 
our immigration, non-quot
a immigration visas, 
all of us kids got them, and then our j
ourney continued by train. Once again guided, 
escorted by train and finally through the Pyre
nees and under the Pyrenees, the tunnels, and 
we got to Spain which was just shortly after 
the civil war had ended and I reme mber a very 
down-trodden, down-beat uh poor Spain. We  got to _____ and there we changed trains in 
_____ and took the train to Madrid and uh then we
 spent one night in Madrid and the next 
day we continued on to Portugal, and then we 
got to finally to Lis
bon. Lisboi (ph) to the 
Portuguese... 
 

Q: On, on the train you had counselors or some body... 

 

A: Always guided by people in charge. These ki
ds, I mean us kids...we were kids. You didn't 
put these kids, you know, alone on a train. There 
was always some one, adult, in charge. I 
couldn't give you the name s and addresses but 
there were also, alwa
ys throughout from the 
time I was at Cassie to the time I got to Lisbon, 
always adults, be they teachers, be they 
counselors, be they people temporarily put 
in charge, always guide
d, people guiding this 
group of children, in charge. We  wer e  never on our own. 
 

Q: Werner, can you tell us a little bit mo
re about the train a
nd the trip itself... 
 

U S HMM  A r chiv es  RG-5 0.0 30* 008 4 
1 3 
 
A: Well, we traveled through ______, the fa mous 
me dieval city with 
the Roma n wall around it, 
and we traveled to _____ and in ____ I thi
nk we changed trains and then from _____ we 
went by train...now we are really in the deep s
outh of France, southwest of France and from 
the city of _____ we took the train underneath
 and through the Pyrenees, partially through 
tunnels, partially winding through uh narrow 
passageways, went through and to this 
poverty-stricken Spain which really looks like a 
like a disaster area 
just shortly after the 
civil war was ended there, and this was just
 two years after the Spanish civil war... 
 

Q: How how were the other childre
n reacting with you on the train? 
 

A: Oh, we were all very happy I would say. How 
we re we reacting. We  were all very happy to 
get out and you know America was in our futu
re. I would say we were all very happy. I 
can't  say that...I can't  report anything negative 
about the train ride. It
 was a very pleasant 
ride I would say and the and the the overnight ti
me  in Madrid and the uh ten days at least 

we spent in Lisbon, I would say there was nothi
ng unpleasant about it. 
By the way, at that 
time we had enough to eat. We  didn't  get up hungry from the table in Li sbon. We  had 

enough to eat. We  were fed. Again it was the 
OSE which had uh charge of us, but I cannot 
guarantee the OSE had charge of us through th
is trip into Spain, through Spain and into 
Portugal to Lisbon, because other elements en
tered the picture. Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt 
became charge, was charged with permitting five
 thousand Jewish children to get to the 
United States from Ger many and central Europe
. A special bill had been passed or special 
legislation passed by Congress. Uh
 Mrs. Roosevelt was put in ch
arge of this organization to 
help the children survive, to get five thous
and kids out of France, occupied France and 

unoccupied France, Vichy France, ge t them to
 the United States. Five thousand emergency 
visas apparently had been ma de available. 
And so this was one group it helped. Another 
group that played a big role, in fact they paid 
for the actual boat tri
p, the ship trip, was the 
American Friends Service Committee, the Quak
ers. They...in fact we carried a a tag on 
our...around uh around our neck indicating that 
the American Friends Service Committee 

Headquarters, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, wa
s was in charge of the trip, so they 

apparen...uh so anyway... 
 

Q: How long were you...I don't mean to in
terrupt...how long were you in Lisbon?   
 

A: I would say ten to fifteen days. We  were
 supposed to go originally with a Portuguese 
freighter name d Nyassa, N - Y - A - S - S - 
A, but the Nyassa never arrived. Instead 
eventually the Serpa Pint o, S - E - R - P - A, the first word, Pinto, P - I - N - T - O, the 

second word, the Serpa Pi nto arrived and uh this
 is the ship we  finally embarked upon. A 
freighter converted to refugee vessel. And 
on this ship we embarked upon for the United 
States in uh early September it was, uh for the 
United States. A very slow trip. I remember 
the ship ve ry well. The accommodat i ons...we were
 in the hold, the children were in the 
hold. There were lots of adult refugees on 
board. Uh there was nothing uh (laughter) 
nothing fancy about it, but like I put out, like I 
point out in my me moir
 of my childhood in 
refugee years, it was my most me morable tri
p. I've made many trips across the Atlantic 
since, by by sea and by air. Nothing to equa
l that trip by this 
beaten-down Portuguese 
freighter, the Serpa Pinto, ma ki
ng a long slow voyage by way of Casa Blanca uh Morocco 
where more adult refugees got on board, and 
then we finally stopped in Be rmuda and uh I 

U S HMM  A r chiv es  RG-5 0.0 30* 008 4 
1 4 
 
don't know...maybe to take on supplies. Nobody 
got on board uh in Bermuda and finally we 
arrived in the port of New York in Septembe
r 1941 and our ...(pause)
...well, the thing was 
at an end. It was the beginning of a new life,
 a new...wasn't ideal. I me an I was with a 
Jewish foster  fa mily. My relatives in the United 
St ates were not in a position to take me  so I 
was placed in Philadelphi a, Pennsylva nia, with a fo
ster family and that wasn't  an ideal foster 
fa mily. Few foster families, inci dentally, ar e ideal. There's been a whole spate (ph)  of 
articles about foster care being 
very inadequate and I can testify to that. Uh it wasn't  wasn't  
bad exactly but it was totally 
lacking in in empathy, sympat
hy, real human sympathy and 
real love for the uh refugee children because I 
wasn't  the only refugee child there that I was 

five years with that fami ly, four years with 
that family and uh but anyway it was a new life. 

I went to an American school, learned Eng
lish, initiated the American...Ame ricanization 

process, learned about Philadelphi
a, about what it was to live 
in the United States, uh played 
with the kids on the block...was a largely Je
wish block, every house 
there was occupied by 
Jewish people, most of them i mmigrants from eastern Europe...uh and uh that was my life 

and starting in late 1941. Ca me  
two and a half mo nths past an
d Pearl Harbor took place and 
the U.S. was at war. Whe n Pearl Harbor was announced that Sunday, the day of infa my  as 

President Roosevelt called it, my English was st
ill very spotty, very 
spotty. It took another 
six months ma ybe befor e  I was able to really 
uh get the hang of it, but they had me  in an 

English uh elementary school class uh sixt
h grade and uh so by hook and by crook I got my 
education. Then I went to junior high school in
 Philadelphia. Then I started high school in 
Philadelphia and finally I moved to New York wh
en my mother,in 1946 
after the end of the 
war, was able to join me  in the United States. 
 

Q: So you were with this family until... 

 

A: I was with this...I was actually with two foster
 families. The first fos...most of the time with 
the first foster family. Then they left the city an
d I went to another foster fa mily in that very 
block. I didn't ...it was like, it was like staying w
ith the same  family almos t . The people lived 
a few houses down the street, was staying in th
e same  street, playing with the same  kids, 

same atmosphere except that this family was 
a little perhaps a little mo
re, had a little more 
empathy for refugees than the other one. I think the other family was in it pr imarily for the 

money, for the finan...financial support they got 
for taking in kids, and they didn't only take 
in refugee kids. They took in Jewish kids
 from br oken homes. They took uh a baby in, a 
little infant, ma ybe ten months old who uh th
e mother had died, ma ybe in childbirth. I 
couldn't say. The father placed it with the fa
mily and the kid's name  was Myron. I still 
reme mber that. I don't reme mber the last name . Uh but anyway they took anybody, anyone 

and anybody as long as they were paid for and th
ey were paid by the Association for Jewish 
Children of Philadelphia. That was th
e organization which ran this operation. 
 

Q: Were you in touch with your mo
ther at all during this period? 
 

A: Yeah. Once I got to the United States, I once 
again was able to correspond. Of course, the 
war was going on in Europe but the U.S. and Brita
in were allies and once again I could have 
a correspondence with my mother, so we corre
sponded and one fine day in Philadelphia...it 
was in 1946...the war had ended just a year ea
rlier...a telegram arrived from the _____, the 
Swedish liner _____, very well-known for its 
many humanitarian mi ssions of evacuation 

U S HMM  A r chiv es  RG-5 0.0 30* 008 4 
1 5 
 
and moving people, and this was a very s
hort telegram. Arriving on the _____, New York, 
Love, Mother. And so shortly th
ereafter I took the train to Ne
w York, my second trip to the 
port of New York...my fi rst one, arrival in
 1941, Se ptember...the second time 1946 of May, 
on a rainy day in May, a seventeen year 
old son (crying) whose childhood ______ me ssed 

up, a seventeen year old son finally me t his mother
 in the port of New York and that was it. 
Finally then I moved to New York, finished 
high school in Ne w York and uh well, that you 
mi ght say is the rather pertin
ent facts about my escaping the 
Holocaust. I mi ght add that my 
mother went to work for the United Se rvice for New Americans, a refugee aid society in 

New York, very important for the ma ny refuge es
 that came to these shor es after the war. 
United Service for New Americans in New York
 City, after the afte
r the refugee numbers 
dimi nished, the refugee service joined with
 the HI AS, Hebrew I mmi gration Aid Society, 
and today it is known as the United HIAS Se
rvice...still exists, uh for Jewish refugees. 
 

Q: How...what actually happened when you sa
w your mother for the first time after... 
 

A: I'll tell you what happened. It was like meeti
ng a a a dear aunt. I tell you what happened. It 
was...ma ybe it was what happe ned...what didn't happen. Wh en I cry about this event, 

it's...when they ruined my childhood...you see I left, 
I left as a child, the 
love of my mo ther. 
When I me t this nice lady walking along the pi
er...(crying)...it was a me eting alright, but it 
wasn't  the same ...(crying)...this, this...they ru
ined my childhood, that's  what they did. Oh, 
we got along fine, but it wasn't  the same  th
ing. It was...my my a
unt could have been 
standing there on the pier. Dear Auntie. Wa s not 
the same  thing. She did not meet that same  
child that she left  at the at the Berlin trai n 
station that summe r  day or late spring day of 
1939. That little boy didn't  exist anymore. He 
had been disappointed 
and disillusioned and 
mi streated, mi shandled, but al
ways lucky enough to escape, to
 escape with his life and 
always having a future in front of him. I must
 say, as I say, as I point out in my me moir 
again and again and again, I was one of the ve
ry very lucky ones. Incidentally, of those 

three thousand or five thousand children what
 were supposed to be saved fr om occupied 
France, of which Mrs. Roosevelt was the chairman or chairwoman, three hundred and 

eleven actually made it between the fall of France and the total occupation of France in 

Nove mber of '42, when the Germans occupied
 Vichy France too. During that period '40 to 
'42, three hundred and eleven children actually 
made it to the U.S.A. out of five thousand 
who uh theoretically were supposed to ma ke it.
 Three hundred and eleven ma de it. I am one 
of three hundred and eleven. I learned that on
ly early this year, that I was one of three 
hundred and eleven because a French book was 
published in Paris by a Professor Sabine 
(ph) _____ in Paris. She specializes in Holocau
st studies and she pub
lished a book last year 
about _________________, These Children We  J ust Had to Sa ve, and there I learned, on 

one of the pages, that three hundred and 
eleven children, these German-Jewish and 
Austrian-Jewish refugee child
ren, were saved and brought to
 the U.S., actually three 
hundred and eleven. 
 

Q: I want I want to come  back again to when
 you met your mother finally. What had she been 
doing and what did you physically do?  Di
d you go out and have dinner together? 
 

A: Uh no. We ll, I don't know. No. I think we went
 to her cousin who lives in central part, 
western New York, and we had dinner there. 
Uh we didn't have...well, we had dinner but

there was two other people, an elderly couple, 
uh uh a first cousin of
 her deceased mother 
who had died in 1940, buried in the Jewish cem
etery of Erfurt, my dear grandma, uh well 
she died in 1940, but her cousin uh Dr. Freelande
r (ph) and his wife lived in New York and 
we had, if I am correct, we ha
d dinner at the Freelander's...uh 
 
Q: You had dinner there and then what did you do? 

 

A: Well, then I returned to Philadelphia to my
 foster fa mily and my mother then found lodging 
and uh was supported by the United Service for New Ameri cans until she went to work for 

the United Se rvice for New Americans. She was supported by them. 
 

Q: This was in New York C ity? 

 

A: She lived in New York, and fo
r a while longer I was in Philade
lphia, for a while longer, but 
shortly thereafter I joined her in New York a
nd went to high school in Ne w York, finished 
my high school year, my final high school year 
in New York and then I left Philadelphia 
behind for good and then as I say I lived in New York, joined her in New York. She lived, 

but you see the story...I me ntioned that too 
in the me moir that 
I wrote...childhood and 
refugee me moir...she had two good years in the United States following her arrival here. 

Her health was good. Then she fell ill and got pr
ogressi vely worse with cancer and she was 
from one hospital to another, trying all kinds
 of treatme nt. Nothing worked for her liver. 
And finally, while I was in Germany in 1952, 
she died in early 1952. Uh I was doing my 
military service, as I mentioned earlier. I got 
a telegram fr om the Red Cross that my mother 

had died. Of course it was not a real surprise 
because I knew that she was in a terminal uh in 
a terminal stage, that she would not recuperate
, that it was terminal
. And what I still find 
ridiculous wa s that the draft board, knowing 
this...they had a documentation from at least 
one doctor stating that her case was terminal and you would think that they would give this 

son of hers, her only son, a deferment. No. The draft board saw that and says, can't  help 

you. Sorry. If we do that for you, we have to do 
it for a great ma ny others and we wouldn't 
meet our quota. A very heartless way of for 
draft board a draft board to treat such a 
situation, where you knew in advance that youwould probably never see your mother again, 

lying in the hospital, you were being sent 
to Germany for your military duty. You knew in 
advance that you saw her that last time be
fore embarking for the ______, Germany, that 
you'd probably never see her again. That's the wa
y it was, and then I heard next from the 
Red Cross that that she had died. Then they fl
ew me  back for the funeral, yeah, the Army, 
so I was there for the funeral but uh they could have given me  a deferment, but her case was 

terminal in in any case. It was very sad when
 you think of...she died at the age forty-nine, 

her life ruined in more ways than one, but 
she could be alive toda
y and she would be around 
eighty-seven or eighty-e
ight today. Ei ghty-eight. 
 

Q: And she was in England during the whole time ?  

 

A: Spent the whole war in England. The final th
ree years in the German
 language division of 
the BBC, working as a secretary to one of the 
executives there. That was her final years. 
She loved it in England, despite the Blitz. Sh
e lived through the Blitz. She loved it in 

U S HMM  A r chiv es  RG-5 0.0 30* 008 4

England. If it hadn't been for me  in the Stat
es she would have stayed in England but she 
probably still would have died. Th
at that wouldn't have changed. 
 
Q: Werner, how would you say, 
how did the war affect you? 
 

A: Not too bad all things considered. I mean 
once I got to Philadelphia I, you know...some of 
the children who ma de it to the States with us
 on that very ship, the 
Serpa Pinto who arrived 
in uh in in Ne w York port, Port of New York, uh we were then taken to Pleasantville, New 

York, by which organization I couldn't  even te
ll you, but Pleasantville, New York, and there 
we were put in a home for just a short while,
 ma ybe two weeks, and every child then was 
eventually taken individually to his new destin
ation, in most instances 
to the relative...in a 
few instances to foster families, but little by 
little we all disappeared, going our own ways. 
But the point is that OSE in Paris had neve
r heard from the youngest of these children. I 
mean they heard from many of the older children
 who retraced their steps, tried to retrace 
their roots during the war. From these youngest children, who by this time  were nine years 

old, ten years old, at the most eleven y
ears old, these youngest of
 the group...uh nothing. 
They've never retraced their steps. The OSE...t
hey never got in touch with the OSE. I've 
never been able to find anyone in the phone book. 
I've tried to find Zomi e, the fellow with 
whom I was  so...together for so long. In fact 
he was the only one with whom I was together 
the entire time , starting in Ca
ssie all the way till we arrive d 
in in Pleasantville, New York. 
(Laughter) The only one with whom
 I was together the entire tim
e. I have not been able to 
find his name ...his name  in German is ____...I gu
ess without the umlaut his name  woul d be 
Stock (ph) and I can't  visualize anyone calling h
im Stock (laughter) in th
is country so I don't 
know what happened to him. He's
 not...made no effort to retrace his steps. That much we 
know, uh so that's  the story. 
 
Q: OK. We 'r e running out of time... 
 

A: I can report...oh we'r e already out of time  
huh. I was going to me ntion that two other, the 
two other kids who were sent to Charbon, 
you know, the other two...there was four...they 
ma de it...they also...their lives were save
d. One got to Switzerland in 1944. The other 
fellow...

Tape #2 
 
...lived in England until 1958. I found about his 
whereabouts finally in 1974, visited him in 
Montreal, Ca nada where he lives to this da
y. From 1958 to this day, living in Montreal, 
Canada, where he runs a bookshop, his ow
n bookshop. His name  is Gerald Glass 
(ph)...running a bookshop in Montreal, the Acad
emic Books hop he calls it, in Montreal, 
Canada. If anyone visits Canada, on Sherbrook 
(ph) Street, Montreal
's  5th Avenue, the 
Academic Bookshop uh is Gerald Glass', one of the survivors, one of the lucky survivors 

who didn't ma ke the transport, the Serpa Pint
o to the U.S., but who ma de his own way out 
of occupied France uh eventually to to 
England and then Canada. The other boy, uh 
Nor man De ____ (ph) was his name  or is his 
name , made his way to Switzerland, over the 
border, you know, on the quiet, successfully cros
sed into Switzerland, eventually after the 
war came to the U.S. Also him I found hi
s whereabouts in 1974 quite by accident . The 
accident  being an alumni association newsle
tter...without uh reading that newsletter I 
wouldn't have found him or Gerald to this day–  
 

Q: Alumni association of what... 

 

A: City College of New York, my alma  ma ter. 
That newsletter is where I found his name , just 
by accident . If I didn't read that ne wsletter
 carefully I wouldn't know what happened to 
Norbert or to Gerald to this day. Anyway 
I found him and he was teaching uh chemistry, un 
professor of chemistry, at Rutgers University
 in New Jersey. Gerald
 as I pointed out uh 
running his bookshop in in uh Montreal, Canada. 
So they too eventually ma de it to the 
Northern Hemi sphere. One to this countr
y, the other one to Ca nada. Many...through the 
OSE I have learned that this or
ganization in Paris...I have lear
ned that mo st of the kids who 
were at Cassie, this original stopping point for 
us...most of the kids survived the Holocaust, 
ma de their way out. Some  to Israel. Some  st
ayed in France. Some to the United Stat es. 
Some  to Canada. Some  to England. One to Aust
ralia. You name  it, they ma de their way out, 
and a few stayed in France and uh and one friend 
of mi ne, my closest fr
iend really, whom I 
really wanted to find mo re than any of th
e others, he died in France in 1962 in an 

automobile automobile accident . He was one of the ones who had decided to ma ke his life, 

had survived the entire occupation under false na
me , false identify, Catholic identify, with a 
uh peasant family...
