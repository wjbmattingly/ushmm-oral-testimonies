Gary Covino: Let me  just have you start by sa
ying your name and ma ybe  where we™re doing the 
interview.   
Lucine Horn: My name  is Lucine Horn and my real name  is 
Estelle Rubenlee
. My ma iden 
name . I a m from Lublin, Poland and presently I re
side in the United States since 1950. And this 
interview is being taken at my
 home at 4850 Wes tland in Lincol
nwood, Illinois.  I offered to do 
this interview to tie in my 
video interview which I took for the Holocaust Museum which 
involved my whole story of the war, Holocaust up 
until to the days of liber
ation. This will be just 
a follow up to what, what happened since 1945 January when I was liberated by the Russians in 

a very small town in Poland, to which I was taken with my husband after the Wa rsaw uprising, 

not the Ghetto uprising.  The Polish uprising wh
ich took place in 1944, in October and as Poles 
there was no Jews at that time anymore. We we
re taken to southwest Poland and dispersed to 

live with farmers.  We  were treated as refugees
 from Wa rsaw and we also
 were fighting for the 
Polish underground. As such the German governme nt placed us with farmers and the farmers 

had to support all the people that they
 evacuated from Warsaw.  Wa rsaw was

evacuated because the frontier was on the Vistul a 
River.  The Russians were comi ng in from the 
East.  The Germans were on the other part of Wa
r s aw and they needed Warsaw to be evacuated 
so that there was the frontier line.   We were 
taken to this very small town and placed by these 
far mers who had no idea about our origins and we 
had to pretend constantly that we are not 
Jews.   That was, that went on from Octobe
r 1944 until January 1945. I don™t remember the date 
but that was the time  when we were liberate
d by the Russians. The Russians came all the way 
through  to southwest Poland and the Germans 
were just rapidly running away. The Russians 
liber ated us  and came into this
 little town. We  still could no
t show the enthusiasm of being 
liber ated and show any love for the Russians whic
h we did have at that time and still do because 
they did liberate us from Hitler. But the Pole
s were not very ha ppy about the Russians comi ng 
into Poland. And they didn™t want the Russians to co
me   to Warsaw to begi
n with and that™s why 
they staged this horrible upr
ising in 1944 in September when  350,000 Poles were killed, was 
killed and the city was practically 40% in ruins a
nd destroyed.   So we still ha d to pretend.  Even 
so we were very happy to see them. And we
 stayed around about a week until we got our 
thoughts toge ther of what we going to do now and how to proceed.  We  did want to go back to 

our home town but it was quite far and of course
 the war was just happening, the war between 
the Germans and the Russians and there was no co
mmunications like trains or buses. Only that 
everything was in great chaos.  But we said goo
dbye to the people to the 
farmers that we lived 
with and told them that we want to go back 
to our home town. And we thought, they thought that 
we were from Wa rsaw. So it took 
us ma ybe about ten days or tw
o weeks to ma ke it.  Wasn™t 
such a long stretch but we were doing it mostly 
by the foot and ma ybe we found a peasant that 
had a horse and buggy and he took us a little bit. 
And we were trying to go back to Lublin. On 
the way  we passed several towns, small and big 
and we saw Jews come  out from hiding so we 

Interview with Lucine Horn

kind of felt warm towar ds those people because th
ey also survived. It was a good sign that there 
was more survivors. Until we came back to Lub
lin to look for mostly to look for fa mily and 
friends.   
 

Q: If I could just ask you, you were saying as
 you were ma king your way to your home  town you 

would see Jews comi ng out of hiding and you know
 after all you had gone
 through in all those 
years of the war, I™m wondering if you could de
scribe a little more, do you reme mber how, you 
know how you and your husband would react when
 you would see that. And how you would feel 
inside. And would you have en
counters with these people. 

 

A: Yes, it was a very chilling experience. The citi
es were mos tly desolate.  And there weren™t too 
ma ny peopl e walking around the streets because 
the Germans had just passed through.  We  
would come  to a town where ma ybe there wa
s a square. And on the square people would 
congregate. And some how, we 
always felt who it was Jewish
 or not. These people were 
completely different. I mean living in Poland a
nd knowing the Polish people, we knew how the 
Polish people behave and how they look. These 
Jewish people were like they are comi ng out 
from hiding. Their heads were down. They were sad. 
They still had the frightened look in their 
eyes. They were probabl y hiding some place.  Wh
ether in the underground or being hidden in 
some  kind of a shack you know.  They did not 
appear like the other people do. And we kind 
of looked the same  way I guess. And commonly 
we just like you know like dog to dog. We  had 

some thing that pulled us to each ot her and we st
arted to talk and it™s the word to approach 
some body was 
Am Who
. 
Am Who
 means in Hebrew 
Am
 is Nation and 
Who
 meant are you 
from the same .  And some how we s a w these people.
 We  saw quite a few of those people.   And 

Interview with Lucine Horn 
4 
 
we just rejoiced in seeing each other, but there 
was the sadness of having lost everything.  So that 
was more or less what happened but we 
didn™t stay on. We  just kept on going.  
 
Q: So you didn™t talk to them very 

 

A:  We ll we just briefly talked to them buteverybody was just engage
d in searching and doing 

his thing and we couldn™t wait to
 get home . We  had a knapsack a
nd we were tired from walking 
and not sleeping and, and you know took us ma ybe ten 
days or two weeks to get to Lublin. Once 
we got to Lublin there wa s a Jewish organization 
and they were regi stering all the people that  
were comi ng back home . A lot of it was a grea
t influx of people from Russia.  And Russia 
allowed these people to come  back.  And ther
e were some  people comi ng out from, very few 
from concentration camps. The majority from Rus s
ia and also some  that were sent to Ge rmany 
for work.  Like the able bodied, not Jewish 
looking, fe ma les mostly.  Because ma les could 
always be checked out for being Jewi sh.   Because of circumcision. So we me t quite a few 

people, acquaintances and when we went to register ourselves at this Jewi sh committee, we 

found that nobody that fr om our fa milies had been re
gist ered so we kind of already thought that 

there™s nobody there from the fa mily. But neverthele
ss we tried to establish ourselves in Lublin 
because we just didn™t™ know what to do with eac
h other. And people were constantly comi ng.  It 
was like every day when we went out to a town
 square you could see a few people comi ng here 
and there.  And of course being a small tow
n, ma ybe some body that you knew. So some  friends 
and acquaintances came. And some  were in more 
need than others.  Some  were fighting with, on 
the Russian front and were wounded.  Some  were 
in very bad shape physically so we tried to 
help each other.  Also none of us had a
nything. And my hus band me t some  fa mily, he me t 

Interview with Lucine Horn 
5 
 
some ti me s, he me t an uncle that our experience w
ith him wa s not very pleasant.  And he tried to 
help us at the beginning but then 
he was very busy with his own 
life, personal life. I don™t want 
to get into it. So actually we we
re alone.  And we just couldn™t find a place for ourselves.  My 
husband wanted to go back to me dical school. He
 was third year medical
 school and he just 
didn™t know where and how.  And the climate in 
Lublin was very unpleasant because the Poles 
were not happy that some  Jews sur vived. And they
 were ma king some very nasty remarks.  And 
I was confronted with this tremendous Polish anti
-Semitism.  Mostly because I did not appear to 
be Jewish.  And if people  me t me  on the ma rket
, or on the street car or bus they would ma ke 
these rema rks to me  that oh they are comi ng back 
from Russ ia.  Hitler didn™t kill them all.  And 
in such a cl imate I just absolutely
 could not live even a mi nute.  
 

Q:  What would you do when you would 
hear rema rks like that.  Would you 
 
A: We ll let me  tell you about a very particular
 encounter because where we lived, we lived 
always where the Aryans lived, we did, never li
ved in so called Jewish
 quarters. Cause my 
mother was a practicing dentist and we had a lo
t of Gentile pa tient s and where we lived was 
almost a Gentile neighborhood.   And in the same building where we lived was a lady that was 
running the laundry service. And 
she had like a cleaning  store.
 And right after the, right 
during the war, when the ghetto was finished and 
we ran away from the ghetto, my mother left a 
lot of things with that  lady.  Silver candelabras
, all kinds of art objects. Things that were of 

value. Thinking that if anybody survives and needs the money to sustain themselves during the 

war, we would just go to her and get this stuff 
and be able to sell it. I 
knew all about it because 
my mother told me  wher e these things were. I kne
w that I have these things with that lady. So I 

Interview with Lucine Horn 
6 
 
tried to get so me  things together and we knew th
at we have to go to Wa rsaw because Warsaw is 
a big town and nobody knows us.  And I have to buy 
some  fa lse papers and we have to just go 
out. So I went to her like in an afternoon and th
is woma n kne w me  since practically I was 4 years 
old.  And when she came in she says oh my god wh
ere are your parents and she started to cry.  
Where is your brother and she was crying and crying. 
And then I said to her,
 can I get the things 
that my mot her left with you. And she said oh it™s 
all in the attic. If you come  back at 2:00 I™ll 
have everything ready. Well needless to say 
I came  back at 2:00 and the Gestapo was 
there waiting for me .  Her cousin was working for the Gestapo, he was a secret  agent. And I had 
a terrible, I don™t want to get in
to it now but I had a terrible en
counter with these people.  And 
practically cost my life.  Some how, 
I got out of it.  And after the wa
r I just couldn™t forget it.  So 
when I came  back to Lublin, there was you know a committee of crimes and, you could really 

talk about these things.  Especia
lly show people that were hostil
e in doing these things.  And I 
went to, over there to first of all I showed my fa ce to her.  And 
when she saw me  that I survived, 
I knew this woma n practically almo
st dropped in what she saw.  
 

Q: Can you still reme mb er it today. 

 

A: Yes, I can reme mber it and I can reme mber. 
My me mory is still good. I can reme mb er what 
she looked like and she just was very, very upset to  see me . And I just said hello to her and I said 

and I reme mber what you did to me .  And I left 
and then I went to this
 place which was run by 
Poles. But don™t™ forget that Poland 
was communist at that time. and it was 
Burjon Bespeki 
Vespechaestva
 and I talked to people there and I aske
d  them what I can do.  To this woma n. 
Because she practically not only cost  my life, bu
t I was taki ng care of my  little br other and my 

Interview with Lucine Horn

husband and they were co mpletely helpless with
out me .  And if some thing would happen to 
them I mean they could have never survived with
out, I was their outside c
ontact. And they told 
me  that there™s nothi ng they can do because I ha
ve  to have witnesses and if I don™t have  any 
witnesses I should just forget it. 
So I was very upset and then we 
stayed for a while in Lublin.  
And the situation wa
s just very bad. 
 

Q: Let me  just ask you, what did you 
want to have happen at this point. 
 

A: Oh I wanted her either arre
sted or to have some  repercussions. I knew for what she was doing 
to me , she was probably doing to others and she c
ould have been even doing it to the Poles.  But 

nothing did happen. And we just tried to get our li
fe together.  We  couldn™t so because there was 

no money and I could not be in Lublin for 
too long because every stone and every home  
remi nded me of my past. And remi nd
ed me  of my parents and I just 
couldn™t take it.  That was in 
1945. I was 19 years old. And we decided that we  were going to try to leave Lublin because 

there was no use of waiting for anybody. We  regi
stered. They could find us. And my husband 
found out that the university that 
he attended before, he had no pa
pers, everything was lost.  That 
the university™s moving from Lwow.   Because Lw
ow was taken by Russia that they moved to  
Blievitz
 which is a German town.  That Poland tookover ok in the exchange for the eastern part 
of Poland. A little bit to the west
 was given to Poland.  So we d
ecided that we going to go, try to 
go there and see if he can get into
 the university cause that was th
e most important thing for us.  
He we got to 
Blievitz
 a nd as it turned out we sp
ent there about 3 or 4 mont
hs and it turns out that 
the university is not comi ng there, but they ar
e going to Breslau which was a much bigger 

Interview with Lucine Horn

university that they took over from
 the Germans.  The town and th
at university from Lwow with 
all the professors were 
comi ng back to Breslau. 
 
Q: And Breslau is in Germany or Pol a nd? 

 

A: Now it™s in Poland.  Now it™s calle
d Breslau. It used to be Germa
n.  So after living for about 3 
or 4 months in 
Blievi tz
, we went to Breslau.  And in Octobe
r of that year, my husband  me t with 
some  profes sors that knew hi m. And he was able to get in for 3
rd
 year me dical school. We 
considered ourselves very lucky. I tried to get 
a job and some how sustain ourselves you know in 
order for him to continue but we knew it™s not go
ing to be on a long time  basis, because we did 
not want to live in Poland. That 
was just an absolute N O.  We 
felt that we just cannot live in a 
country that hurt us so much.   And the me mories
 are too painful and if you want to start a new 
life, it ha s to be some place else, not in Poland. 
 
Q:  There you are right after the war in this plac
e, as you say where all th
ese horrible things that 
happened and you say there were me mories everywhe
re. I™m wondering it™s just so hard today to 
imagine being in that situation.  I wonder if you c
ould describe a little more what your day to day 
emotions were like. Would you say today that 
you were depressed or would you cry.  Would you 
turn a corner and see a certain place.  I™m just
 trying to figure out what
 that would feel like. 
 

A: We ll when we were in Lublin it was indesc
ribable how painful and ha rd. Because to give you 
an example to add insult to injury was the fact 
that the Poles were so hostile.  Would we have 
been embraced by the people that we knew and that we grew up with and with people that also 

Interview with Lucine Horn 
9 
 
suffered, but not to that extent. 
It would have been ma ybe half 
way bad.  But the hostility was 
just so tremendous. My best girlfriend was pr
egnant 9 months. She came  into Lublin. Her 
husband was killed on the front.  That now this is
 this woma n giving birth to a child. The first 
child born after the war.   In a Catholic hos
pital. And the nurses just damned this baby. God 
damn, Hitler didn™t ki ll them all. We have to have
 a Jewish child now . It can™t be helped. I mean 
this was just unbearable. But after we left Lublin
 I knew that we had to be strong to survive.  
And the emphasis was mostly on survival and how 
and what to do.  All the survivors were trying 
to just find a way, whether to go to
 the United States or emigrate or
 go to Israel.  Illegally but do 
some thing for yourself  because here you are al
ready surviving the war. And you got nothing but 
your life, nothing else. And now it™s up to you to
 know which direction to
 take and which way. 
It™s like you™re on an island and you want to sa
ve yourself. It was a ma tter of not saving your 
life, as much as knowing what to do with yourself. And because we had this one direction that 

my husband wanted to finish school. He didn™t wa nt
 to go into business. The easiest thing to do 
was to smuggle and to sell. Everything was still 
chaotic.  So I just knew that we had to, that 

looking past is one thing and bei
ng hurt in it is another. But it
™s not going to help emotionally 
because you see we were very young and when you™re young you™re strong. You take life in a 

different way. And I just knew that we had 
to go on, make some ri
ght decisions and push 
forward and we were among people who had the 
same  goal. Fortunately we were surrounded by 
students and academic people who had the same goa
ls and wa nted the same  thing out of life, 
rather  than making money and maybe amassing some fortunes by some illegal dealings and so 

forth. 

  

Interview with Lucine Horn 
10 
 
Q: It sounds like what you™re saying is the su
rvival that the drive for survival you developed 
during the war, it never let up. You 
just stayed in that condition. 
 
A: Definitely.  Definitely.  The power of surviv
al even for people that 
were in concentration 
camps whic h I never was and even people that sa
w their dearest slaughtered, there is a certain 
think in the huma n nature that 
really wanted to survive.   
And you know and I cannot talk about 
it to other people, but this is wh
at we felt.  And I knew that I 
have to help my husband and I 
got a job.  We got a little apar
tment and I got a job.  And, in 
Bratswath
, in Breslau and he went 
back to school. And we knew it™s only temporary but
 we knew that he has to wait a year just to 
get his papers. Cause once he gets
 all his papers that he finish
ed 3 years me dical school, ma ybe 
wherever we  go, to any country, he
™s got at least some thing to s
how. And ma ybe he™ll be able to 
continue. So that™s exactly  what happened. We  
were in Breslau. We lived there almo st a year. 
He finished me dical school, third year, got all the pa
pers and then we decide
d out.  This is it. We  
really have to sever all our, our
 relationships with Po
land and just erase it from our lives and just 
go on. And we had no gall. We  didn™t know where to
 go. It was very hard at the time, you know 
to ma ke any, any sense was, with your plans. 
But then we joined a Zionist group which was a 
student group. There was about 25 Jewish students,
 Zionist oriented and 
we thought that ma ybe 
if we go with a group it would be easier for us 
to be recognized wherever we go.  Rather than 
one individual person.So with a knapsack, the 
BreiHa
 was helping Israelis, were helping the 
Jews out of Poland in that time .  In a semi -legal
 way.  Meaning that if you 
went to the border, to 
Czechoslovakia  there maybe would be trucks 
there waiting for you and then taking you ma ybe 
to Italy or some place, but it was all kind of se
mi -legal without any guarantees and with these 
papers in his hand, on with a knapsack and with very little mo ney we decided to try and we went 

Interview with Lucine Horn 
11 
 
with this group. And there was ma ybe about 25 of
 us.  We  got into Czechoslovakia and then 
from Czechoslovakia, they took us, this 
BreiHa
, they took us to Vienna
.  Because Vienna was a 
big concentration of refugees  
and the American Joint has been 
sponsoring a lot of places. And it 
was like a transit pl ace, is for people that 
were comi ng out of Poland and comi ng out of 
concentration camps, trying to go other places.  A
nd there was an awful lot of people at that time 
in Vienna. And Vienna was occupied by all f
our, but the Americans 
had a great hand in 
deciding what to do at that time . And as we came 
to Vienna, we were aided already by the Joint 
Distribution Committee to and they, 
they really encouraged us not to go any further because they 
said that they would like to help the students. 
 And they mi ght have a way for the Austrians to 
allow these peoples to study. Under pressure, wit
hout tuition because as a, as a part of a 
reparation of what happened to these people. And 
that really happened. The Americans helped us 
to get into the university, get a very small stip
end fr om the United States. Not to pay tuition at 
the university.   We  had to, of course, qualify.  
There was all kinds of Latin examinations and 
everything to go through it. And have some  pape
rs to show. But it was an opportunity for my 
husband to continue and he fell fo
r it right away. That was 1946. Oct
ober.  They helped us with 
some  living quarters. Of course it was very cr
owded and we had to share rooms and things. But 

most of the people were single. There was only a
nother ma rried couple.  And us.  And we were 
helping each other. You know and Vienna at
 that time also had no food. Everything was 
rationed. So you got a little bit of 
this and a little bit of that. Yo
u put it all in one pot and we had 
some  soup a t  night. We  felt ki nd of good about itbecause we knew that we had a goal.  We  knew 

that we™re doing some thing for our future.  A
nd it wasn™t very unpleasant because the Jewish 
student at that time , we c a me  with a small gr
oup. But there were 400 Jewish students at that time 
in Vienna.  And we were all supported by the Am
ericans through the Austrians that had to do it.

Interview with Lucine Horn 
12 
 
 And we were a great group of people. And we
 spent 4 years there. It was kind of very, 
very nice.  Even though we didn™t have any mone y, 
but Vienna  is a wonderf
ul place to live. Even 
so we felt that we never forgot that they were 
connected with Hitler and they were anti-Semites. 
But of course at that ti
me they didn™t™ show it. 
 

Q:  So that was diffe
rent than in Poland. 
 

A: Different and you know our hostility pr imarily 
was to the Poles, who personally, personally 
were helping with the Ge rmans.  Personally.  He
re at least we were in
 a country where they 
allowed us to go to school.  We  had the freedom
 of moving. I could not work. They were very 
strict about people that are not 
Austrians, very strict. So i
llegally some body employed me  for a 
little bit.  And we just had a gay student
 life.  You know. We were young and we didn™t 
need much a nd we could go to the opera and 
stand you know on top there and go to a concert 
and never sit down.  You know but it was a city 
that offered a lot to us. And it was a real 
bohemi an student life that we 
had.  We had a wonderful group 
of Jewish people and a lot of 
feedback you know from the Jews and from the 
Jewish organizations. And that was the four 
years in Vienna.  

 

Q: Is this, were you able to in comparison to th
e way you felt for years up to this point, were you 
able at  all to relax a bit 

 

A: Yes, definitely. Definitel
y. There were other tensions. Yo
u know.  I mean first of all you 
didn™t™ know the language. I, I myself went to univ
ersity because there was the easier things for 

Interview with Lucine Horn 
13 
 
me  to do. You know and I had to, we  had a lot of studying to do in the Ge rman language. The 
language was foreign to us.  So it was im
possible to study.  You don™t know the language. 
 It was very, very hard at 
the beginning and my husband wa
s under a lot of pressure in 
medical school because  they didn™t like fore
igners you know. The me dic a l school was gigantic 
and tremendous and, and they would rather not pass 
Jewish students and espe
cially foreigners so 
we had two strikes against us you know. But some
how we ma naged.  It wa s hard. It was very, 
very hard. My husband was under tremendous pre
ssure.  I really didn™tcare because it wasn™t 
that important to me. I was biding my time, but
 for him it was very important and he was under 
tremendous pressure.  Of course a lot of professo
rs were Nazis. And the 
level at the university 
was very, very high at that time . And he had a 
hard time. I mean he had four years of hell 
because he really ha d to succeed and get that di
ploma.  In the meanti me, people were trying to 
see where they can go and what they
 can do.  A lot of our students did not finish.  Some  went to 
France. Some went to Italy and illegally to Is
rael. And some just stay
ed out and you know tried 
to finish, because some how I ma de contact with 
my fa mily.  Distant family in New York. And 
through pure coincidence, some body me t some body 
on a train and we were talking about people 
in Lublin. And some body me ntioned cousins and to 
ma ke the story short, I found out that there™s 
a distant relative living in Ne
w York, quite well to do. And having a treme ndous fa mily in 
Europe, being from Europe himself. And that if 
I ma de contact with him 
t hat he would probably 
be able to help us, mostly in, in securing a affi
davit to come to the United States.  So while my 
husband was doing all that, I ma de contact with thes
e people and I told them what who I was and 
I told them that we are here and my husband 
is finishing me dical sc
hool. And upon the direction 
of my uncle I call him uncle, we were advised no
t to do anything before he gets his diploma. 
Because it will be  impossible to continue in the Un
ited States.  He has to finish. We  just have to

stay as long as it takes for him 
to finish me dical school. And th
at was our primary goal. As I 
said, life in Vienna was not unbearable. We  rea
lly had, we ma naged to have a lot of fun. We  
wanted to have a little fun because we  were in hell for so ma ny years. And our youth was 
practically nothing.  Wa r broke out, I was 13 years old.  You know so we really wanted to do a 

little bit livi
ng and, and see what™s going on in this wo
rld. And that wasn™t impossible. We  had 
our ways to do it.  And finally we waited until he  
finished me dical school and we waited to come  
to the United States be ca use uncle sa id that  he will a, gi ve us an affi davit to be able to come  to 

the United St ates. 

 

Q: There™s one thing I™d like to 
ask you about which is you™re with
 all these other students and 
people who have survived you living in that kind 
of big barracks or dorm or whatever you want 
to call it.  

 
A: It was an old school house. 
The Germans that they gave us. 
 
Q: I™m wondering if there was 
a lot of discussion and debate
 among you all about where to go, 
whether to go to Israel, whethe
r to go to some where else.   
 

A: It, it differs a lot.  Some  of
 my friends went to Paris because 
they had uncles in Paris and they 
wanted to be with their family.  Fa mi ly was a  big factor. Whe never some body had a family they 

were really fl ocking to be with their fa mily.  
We didn™t™ have anybody anywhere. A lot of people 
were Zionists and they really wanted to go to Isra
el. Going to Israel was not very si mp le because 
it was Palestine and you had to really go on an i
llegal, on those boats in
to Italy and (no sound)

 A lot of people were Zionists and they really
 wanted to go Israel. Go
ing to Israel was not 
very simple because it was Palestine and you had 
to really go on an illegal on those boats into 
Italy and illegally but a  lot of
 people did that.  Some  of our 
students, I must tell you are still 
living in Vienna and never left.  They intermarried
 and for some reason or 
other, they were their 
studies were rather confining to 
the Austrians. For instance they 
had all kinds of social studies 
and other things where it would be very hard 
to apply it in a different country. You know. We  
were fortunate because medicine is almost simila
r or the same  all over. So it was all different. 
The ma jority of, of our student
s went to Israel. Whoever had 
a chance not to go, opted probably 
to go someplace else. Some went to South Ameri
ca if they found sponsors.  If they had ma ybe 

some  relatives. Now my husband knew that when he
 will go to the United States he  will have to 

repeat the whole thing and take internships and 
he was so worn out from this German and he 
really was in very bad shape. I mean he wa
s very thin.  He was physically and me ntally 
absolutely exhausted. And he said to me  that he
 doesn™t see how he can 
go to a country where he 
will have to do it all, a
ll over again.  With the language and 
everythi ng and to get a license to 
practice, it was, would be very ha
rd for him.  On the other hand, I 
myself even so I had fa mily in 
Israel. And I knew that if I go to Israel I woul
d go home . But I myself was very worn out from 
the war. I couldn™t™ take the bur
den of being a pioneer again a
nd Israel was at the pioneering 
stage at that time. and maybe it was selfish on my part. But don™t™ forget that I was 13 when the 

war broke out. I was the one that had to earn the 
living. I had the one that had to go to a ma rket 
and sell under pressure of being recognized.  I wa
s the one that had to deal with apartments and 
Gestapoes and food and everything else. I had a burd
en of not only to take care of mys e lf but I 
had a brother who was nine year, nine years younge
r than I was and I had him for almost a year 
and a half. And a husband that couldn™t™ show 
hi s face on the street. So I was under, I had a 

Interview with Lucine Horn 
16 
 
tremendous burden, burden surviving. And I just 
couldn™t™ see myself. The thought of, of being 
shot or the thought of, of having th
e Arabs there doing all the things 
that they were doing at that 
time in Israel. There were still wars there. 
You know there was the 46 war and there was the 48 
independence. And then there was another war. 
  The thought of being 
in another war or, or 
hearing the shooting again. It, to me , it was just
 unbearable. I knew that
 I cannot do it.  And I 
told my husband I would like just to come to a c
ountry to live a little bit in peace. I just want 
peace.  If later on he wants to go to Israel, if thin
gs straighten up, fine.  Bu
t I have to have a rest. 
I just cannot do it anymore and he understood. He
 said ok let™s try. We ™ll see how it works out. 
We will you know we were in agreement.  It was 
 

Q: He wanted to go to Israel. 

 

A: He wanted to go to Israel because the thought 
of being able to practic
e and be a doctor right 
away. Israel, just as long as you 
had a diploma, you didn™t have to do anything. They took to the, 
to the hospitals there. You know private me dicine was not there. I mean they never had private 

me dicine. It was all socialized me dicine at th
at time.But you could get 
a job and you would have 
to do things. And the thought of him to study an
other language and starti
ng all over again it 
wasn™t possible. But he gave in to, he knew that
 I just couldn™t do it.  He would have a basket 
case. As long as I was holding up it was ok. But I 
just couldn™t do it. I wa
s a child. And I said, I 

had such a burden and I needed, I needed some sp
ace.   So he decided that we™ll come  to the 
United States. And of course I had the full support 
of my fa mi ly who really wanted us to come  
here. And my uncle sent  affidavits and papers
 and we waited until my husband finished school.  

And we couldn™t wait because ten days later we 
were already trying to ge
t on our DP status and 

Interview with Lucine Horn 
17 
 
just take off and leave. And when we left Vienna 
there was still a lot of ki
ds that didn™t finish.  
Don™t™ forget he was one of the older students. So 
he there were kids that stayed and it took them 
longer to finish or even me dical
 school longer. They were just 
starting at Vienna. He came  in 
already was three years behind him so it was much
 easier for him.  And we left Vienna and we 
took off for the United St ates. 
 

Q: How did you come  over? 

 

A:  We ll that was another story. You see we 
were DPs, displaced persons.  And displaced 
persons were being shipped to the United St
ates on army transports. Ours was general 
Bletchford. And general Bletchfo
rd was supposed to be a transporter for 400 soldiers. We  were 
1200 people.  And we were going in the mi ddle of 
Nove mber and we had to be taken first from 
Vienna to a place in Bremerhaven.  And ther
e we waited, 3,4,5,6 weeks in a camp until these 
ships were bringing people over to the United St
ates, back and forth.  And there were ma ybe 

three or four ships but at that time there must
 have been 6, 7000 people waiting there in this 
camp. And of course we had to
 undergo a tremendous me dical, physical examination because 
anything with a spot on your lung, right away you we
re ejected. It wasn™t 
like today that people 
comi ng with TB, AIDS a nd everything else. It was unbelievable what kind of me dical scrutiny 

we had to undergo.  In order to be able to come  to the United States.  We  waited about three or 

four weeks in Bremer and then finally we got 
on this ship. The voyage was so bad  that we 
almost didn™t ma ke it because the, the ship was ol d and we had, we were 1200 people. The food 

was absolutely not, not even to talk about.  A
nd look it was for free, so I mean there was the 

bunk beds and everything. We  just had to go.  
And we went to Halifax Canada. We  had 400 

Interview with Lucine Horn 
18 
 
people for Halifax Canada. So first we went, it to
ok us about 12 days. First 
we went to Canada.  
Got off these people, that, that were for Canada
 and they all had papers
 and sponsors. And we 
had ten dollars but we had a whole big crate of
 medical books that my husband couldn™t™ part 
with.  But became obsolete in a very short time.  He had two mi croscopes that he woul dn™t part 
with.  And very little personal 
belongings. I have to me ntion th
at my uncle was very generous 
and he tried to help us during th
e our stay in Vienna. He was very
 impressed with the fact that 
my husband wants to study. He felt it personally 
that he wants to help him,  although he never 
me t hi m. He  was, my husband was the only one fr
om the whole family that he was helping and 
trying to bring over here that show
ed any interest in, in his, in
 being a professional ma n. And he 
tried to help us as much as he could. He us
ed to send us mone y through Switzerland. My aunt 
used to send clothes and warm coats for me  or 
whatever they could, they really did for us. It 
wasn™t easy to send stuff over there but they were ve
ry nice and very generous.  So that ma de our 
stay in Vienna much nicer. And we finally arrive
d at the United States.  Well my first impression 
of the free world was 3:00 in the morning in Hali
fax in the harbor, seeing a seven or eight year 
old boy in the mi ddle of the winter all bundled up 
selling newspapers.  And trying to, to tie up 
the paper to a rope and throw th
e paper with the rope over to 
the ship. And then these people 
were, whatever people ha d was probably dol
lars because nobody was going with Austrian 
money. Then the people would in turn
 tie the dollar to the rope a
nd throw it back to him. I never 
saw that before. I came from a well to do home 
and I really haven™t en
countered anything like 
that.  And all I knew about the free world  are th
ings are so wonderful. I mean the idea of in 
Europe at that time  was actua
lly that in America people are 
finding mone y on the street. You 
know and you were very gullible. The thought of that
 boy at 3:00 in the morning just never left 

me .  And that was like 50 some  years ago. I sa
id does a boy that age at 3:00 in the morning has 

Interview with Lucine Horn 
19 
 
to sell newspapers like that. And he was ve
ry, very pushy. And people were dying to have a 
paper even so they couldn™t read it. You know
.  But then we arrived in Ne w York. And of 
course my family was waiting for me. Also we didn™t™ know each other but we had all kinds of 
signs, with red carnations and things like that. 
And it was very cold in New York.  Ne w York 
was not very pretty at that time.  It was very 
windy and we were just absolutely worn down.  
From this horrible, horrible tr
ip. And everybody was taken to HIAS
  which was the Hebrew aid 
organization but my uncle did not want us to be
 there.  Because living circumstances were kind, 
kind of hard. 

 

Q: Can I ask you, do you reme mber or do you have 
any first impressions or me mories of when 
you came into New York Harbor. What was that like. What time  was that? 

 

A: Yes, first of all it was Thanksgiving so al
ready on the boat we had turkey. And I didn™t know 
anything about Thanksgiving and ju
st one good meal was fa bulous. A
nd they were telling us the 
crew on the dock, that they were 
telling us it™s Thanksgiving. And 
that™s a holiday the Europeans 
don™t™ have.  And I cherish this ho
liday til this very day and every time  I have family for dinner 
we always talk about Thanksgiving because th
is is our anni versary of comi ng in. And, and 
unfortunately it was also Saturday 
or Sunday.  We couldn™t get  off 
the ship but at least it wasn™t 
shaking any more.  You had to wait for the cust
oms for Monday morning.  There was all kinds of 
people with us you know.  There were very religious
 people which were comi
ng in with crates of 
china for holidays and china for, for meat and china for milk and china for this. And it was really 

funny when the customs opened up those crates
 and asked them and they really didn™t 
understand what was going on because china in 
Europe, especially good porcelain wa s very 

Interview with Lucine Horn 
20 
 
inexpensive  and these people apparently had mone
y and they tried to bring it all to the United 
States. I mean I didn™t™ have this problem. We
 had books and two mi croscopes. But it was very 
funny when these people tried to 
explain to the customs how t hey 
had this ritual.  Of not eating 
from the same dishes you know all the time.  And th
en of course it was gloomy. It was dark.  But 
my aunt came  and took us to a little
 hotel for which my unc le paid for.  
  
Q: I™m just curious and maybe this is just me
 from seeing, reading about immi grants and seeing 
these films. You always have this image of th
e boat comi ng in the harbor and the Statue of 

Liberty appears.  And all that. 
Did you see that.  Do you remember
 that at all. You™re shaking 
your head. 

 

A: It was so windy that at that
 day when we arrived a brick 
fell from some  big building and 
killed a person. You know.  It was just 
a very gloomy unfriendly day on the 27
th
 of November. 
And it was so ma mmoth to us. I mean New York. Ju
st so ma mmoth. I™ve never. I lived in Vienna 
which is a big city but this was just unbelievabl
e. And of course the la
nguage barrier too. I took 
a few, knowing that I™m going to be in the Unite
d States, I already took 
a few courses. At the 
University.  But that™s a differ, that™s a diffe
rent English. Maybe in L
ondon I would feel better 
with it.  And because among all these people that
 came off the boat I was the only one that knew 
a few words of English, I always had people w
ith me , trying to go wherever I go because my 
uncle got us a hotel room. But th
e me als, we were supposed to go back to the HIAS 3 times a 
day for breakfast, lunch and dinner and we had to
 travel by bus.   And we had to find our way 
from the hotel to 425 Lafayette Street which I still reme mber you know. And there was some  

other people that stayed in the hotel and ever
y mo rning and every after
noon I would have these 

Interview with Lucine Horn 
21 
 
cohorts with me   and the taxi drivers were ve
ry unfriendly. When I asked them which way we 
can walk or can we take the bus, they said no if
 you take a cab we™ll take you there, but they 
were very unfriendly. And while we were in the 
HIAS every day some  American Jews tried to 
come  in and ask us if we want to rent a r
oom, communicating in Yiddish. And also because at 
the HIAS there were people fr om all over th
e world, Jews. Speaking all different kind of 
language.  Well we encountered th
at in Vienna too. There were 
Roma nian Jews and Hungarian 
Jews and they were Latvian Jews and Polish Je
ws and you know Jews just
 don™t™ get along very 
well.  Everybody has a different culture.  Everyb
ody grew up in a different place. And there was 
a lot of fighting between them. A
nd t hen all of a sudden  a lot of
 people came with
 little children 
and the grownups had to look either for an apartm
ent or for a job or anything. The children were 
completely lost and they needed a nanny for those 
children.  So they got me
 to work with these 
children.  Every day I would go there in the morni
ng and have my breakfast in this me ss hall. My 
husband would go to, to Park Row which was th
e physicians committee who was trying to find 
internships and residencies through the United Stat
es for these Jewish doc
tors, providing that a 
community would offer for about 2 years or so 
assistance, monetary assistance to these people 
because these people coul d not work. And some of
 them had families.  So they had to fi nd a 
community that wanted to support this given docto
r while he is in training. So my husband had 
to go there in the morning and I was working at
 the HIAS with these 
children.  And because I 
speak a few languages, I could communicate 
with these children. 
And for that I was 
compensated with $25 a week. We ll that was alrea
dy very good because with the $25 a week we 
could go to a movie and listen to English. First of
 all it was a great thing 
to go and listen what™s 
going on. We also bought a radio because we were 
putting in quarters into 
a radio at the hotel 
and that paid for 20 mi nutes. So we figured out
 well it™s an American idea you know. You put in 

Interview with Lucine Horn 
22 
 
a quarter and the radio plays for 20 mi nutes.  We
, we it took us time to figure it out but we 
wanted to hear. They told us just to listen to 
the spoken language.  So finally we decided to buy a 
radio. We  bought a radio for $25 and we listene
d to our own radio. So we, we ma de an 
investme nt but we didn™t have to put in the quarters any more. And we just waited. It was a 
waiting game  at that time.  Goi
ng to the hotel, comi ng back, getti
ng a little bit acquainted with 
the area.  And of course my aunt and uncle alwa
ys had us over for dinner. I me an it was Friday 
night. They lived at the Riverside drive in a 
magnificent apartment. They were very wealthy 
people but very generous.  They came here duri
ng the war, but they already had a lot of 
businesses and money in Switzer
land and they had a tremendous, tremendous fa mily in New 
York and they were trying to help everybody. And goi
ng there was like a, it was like  a fairy tale 
world, you know.  Because they had a ma gnificen
t apartment overlooking the river and they 
were traveling a lot abroad. He 
had businesses in Korea and Japan 
and all over. My aunt being a 
very tiny little aesthetic lady w
ith servants and a chauffeur and, 
and beautiful things at home . 
Well to me  it was really  like, like a fa iry, 
fairy land you know. And we were going there for 
dinner. And in a very subtle way she would put 20 
or 30 dollars in the pocket of my coat because 
she wouldn™t want to humiliate me  to give me  the money you know, which was probably 

different from all the other people that came ove
r here and ma ybe experienced family relations 
here you know.  I just had very good, very 
good feeling and a very good relationship with 
them. She always asked me  if I need anything. A
nd I said no we really don™t need anything. We  
just have to wait. We  ha ve enough food. We  just 
have to wait until some thing happens that my 
husband gets dispersed to some place.   And of 
course we were in a different group of people 
because ot he r people didn™t™ know 
what to do with themselves. We  had it   a goal. We knew he 
has to get an internship and ofcourse we wanted to stay in New York.  Be cause we didn™t know 

Interview with Lucine Horn 
23 
 
there was a United Stat es. We just knew that th
ere is a New York. And we had a few cousins and 
my aunt and uncle and we  wanted to be in New York. 
 

Q: So were you getting used to the city. It wa
sn™t as intimi dating then or it still was. 
 

A: It was In, we were there six weeks and it 
was intimidating. It was, but you know you get a 
little better feeling of what™s going on and we
 were told that we cannot stay in New York. 
Because all everybody, all the doctors wanted to
 stay in New York. And there isn™ t enough 
hospitals in New York. And we were told th
at we  should ma ybe consider going to a small 
community which is mu ch nicer, where the peop
le are nicer.  Where 
you can really you don™t 
feel so lost . It™s more like a family. Well th
e committees are there, the Je wish committees. 
Everybody was trying to help the refugees and the 
Jews had come  over. Everybody felt a little bit 
guilty you know that that they were there and th
ey survived and they weren™t punished like we 
were. So after six weeks they found a very frie
ndly little community in Rochester New York, 
who was willing to accept a Jewish doctor and help him out. And they found a hospital that 

would take him in as a, as an intern.  Cause he
 needed two years of inte
rnship.  And one day we 
got on a train that was 1950. We  got in a train 
in New York. We said goodbye to my aunt and 
uncle and on the train we came to Rochester New York. Well the fi rst thing was that we 

couldn™t™ get off the train because there was th
at much snow.  New York had, didn™t ha ve any 
snow and we were just in shoes. We  didn™t™ 
have any boots or anything 
like that. So that was 
difficult. We  had to go out and buy a pair of boots.  And the committee was very nice. They 

waited for us.  And they already 
had a little room rented from a fa mily that came  in, in 1939 and 
it was a German fa mily. And they were two working people. They had an old house.  And 

Interview with Lucine Horn 
24 
 
they wanted to sublet a room for mo ney. They n
eeded the money.  Then they looked for a Jewish 
fellow, a Jewish couple or some
body that would live with them. 
 
Q: These people were Jewish or not. 

 

A: Yes.  Yes, these people were Jewish. The 
committee, the Je wish committee tried to place us 
in this home. And when we went to live with 
these people, it was a marv
elous relationship. They 
had one daughter.  And to me  it was like ha
ving another home because they were extremely 
friendly. Not very sophisticated pe
ople.  But intelligent. He wa
s completely uprooted.  He had 
to work as a presser, pants. And she was sewing. A lot of Jewish people were doing that. But 

intelligent people. They sent their daughter to coll
ege and we just had a ve
ry nice two years with 
them in Roc hester.  Felix had to go into the hos
pital. And we were not sorry that we left New 
York because  it was ni ce. It was really nice. 
 Spring came and it was a small town. And very 
green and completely different than European 
cities, with the big ol
d buildings, you know.  
Small buildings, small homes.  Back yards, little
 gardens and it was very pleasant. And I planned 
to get myself a job and they said they™re going to
 try to pl ace me somepl ace because they didn™t 
want to completely support us.  At that time  Ithink we were getting 16 dollars a week. I me an I 

don™t™ really reme mber exactly but we were living 
with these people. And they were very dear to 
us until they day they died.  They tried of fi
nd me a job. Felix had a very hard time  at the 
hospital.  First of all he was an
 (extra?) between Apr
il and July he was an (extern? ).  July the 
internship starts. It was a small hospital but 
a teaching hospital. Ther
e were 27 interns and 
residents there. And they found a lady who wa
s Ge rman descent who was a spinster who 

was quite we ll to do and wanted to help and 
she taught him English. She would actually have 

Interview with Lucine Horn 
25 
 
him over in her house for dinner. And she woul
d sit with him for an hour or two speaking 
German to him and teaching him English. Very love
ly lady.And they tried to get me  a job.  And 
they found me  a job at Woolworth™s  where I wa
s selling baked goods. And that was a six days a 
week job. I think I was ma king 20 s o me  dollars a 
week. and it wasn™t a ma
tter of my preference 
because they were the ones.  It was you know what
, maybe it™s a little simila
r of, to the situation 
today that people are on welfare. I was completely depending on them.  I couldn™t say gee I 

don™t™ want that job because I had 
3 years of university in Vienna a
nd I really don™t™ like to stand 
there and sell fried cakes and doughnuts. But th
ese  people were helping me.  That was 
temporary. They were, I couldn™t™ tell them I  don™t 
want to do it. It wouldn™
t™ be fair.  So I had 
to take the job.  So I took the job and it was 
very difficult at the beginning. Because I didn™t 
know a fried cake from a  doughnut. I mean that was 
strange to me . And I was standing at the 
counter surrounded by younger girls who practically
 never we nt to high school. And they all 
knew. I me a n they knew people came in and they wa
nted 3 of this and 6 of this and 5 of this. 
And some how I didn™t™ have to
 write down on the box and figure out how much they owe me . 
Because we were putting the string on and they
 were adding 18 and 14 and 15. I somehow did it 

without having to write it down, because I added it
 up in my head.  And after six months the sup, 
no, after that was ma ybe after 3 months. The Supe
rvisor came up to me .  She said I see that 
you™re quite smart.  Maybe we™ll give you a little
 better job. Maybe this is not the right job for 
you. And I started to speak a litt
le better. And they said you k
now what, we™re going to put you 
in the stock room. You™re going to ma ke up orde
rs. The orders come  from downstairs and they 
you™re going to go to the stock room and you™re 
going to be in stock room. And you™re going to 

put together these orde rs for each station dow
nstairs. And I was very grateful because I 
could sit, I didn™t™ have to sta
nd six days a week, 48 hours that wa
s kind of hard. And I started to 

Interview with Lucine Horn 
26 
 
work in the stock room.  But I still was not ve
ry happy. And after six months, I was granted one 
week™s vacation paid. And as soon as I got my 
weeks™ vacation I went to the New York state 
employme nt  agency.  And I said you know what, 
I don™t™ speak English very well but I have, 
first of all I had two years of 
me dical school cause I went to me
dical school. I said I have two 
years of me dical school. I know me
dical terminology and my Englis
h is not that great but can 
you get me  a job. So they offered me  right away
 two jobs. One was telephone answering, I mean 
telephone company.  Ans wering with the numbers a
nd the other one is was at the Blue Cross and 
Blue Shield. And I kind of liked that because 
I was with a husband that was studying me dicine 
forever and ever and ever.  And I had to do 
with him the you know the lessons and everything 
else.  And listen to everything so  I never came back
 to Woolworth™s™   I 
just took the job at the 
Blue Cross Blue Shield. And it was entirely 
different feeling on the job. I was ma king $35 a 
week and after 3 months they would review me
. And I was approving me dical claims because I 
knew the terminology and there was  restrictions 
on certain diagnoses. And there was   certain 
preexisting conditions and other f
actors you know. And I liked it. 
I liked my job very much. I 
had a desk and I had a phone and I 
worked with very nice people. In
 a very nice office.  And at 
that time we  already mo ved out from the peopl
e there because we wanted to have our own 
apartment, and I was ma king already a little mo
ney. And I decided we™re going to take our own 
apartment because at that time $55 a month. It was 
a studio with a drop leaf table and a tiny little 
kitchen.  But it was our own. And my 
husband couldn™t™ wait to get a car.  It was very hard to be 
without a car because you know it™s a town a
nd you have to get in to the hospitals. And 
weekends we couldn™t move any place you know. We  were
 sitting in that little apartment.  So he 
had these mi croscopes and he decided he says you know wha t  I™m going to sell the mi croscope 

Interview with Lucine Horn 
27 
 
and buy a car.  Which he did. He sold the mi cros
cope and he bought a little old Plymouth, a 47 
Plymouth. I think it was 5 or 600 dolla
rs.  And he knew how to drive. 
 

Q: How did he know how to drive. 

 

A: We ll I think he drove in Europe. So in 
Blievi tz
 he already drove.  I mean cars was his thing 
you know. So we already had a little car  a
nd I was ma king enough to cover and whenever I 
didn™t have enough, they would pay me  the differen
ce of what I needed for very basic things. 
And he started his, his internship and he was qui
te happy there. They were very nice to him. And 
the hospital was a  teaching  hospital. He wa
s very happy and I was working and then on s, 
because I only worked five days a week, on Saturd
ay and Sunday I sold clothes.  At the Lerner 
Shop and I ma de another $12 a week. And you 
know it kind of was beginning to work out 
for us a little bit.  Um.  I like 
to work for the Blue Cross and he
 had another year I think on that 
internship. In the meantime he tried to apply to 
ge t a license  at New York State but it was very 
difficult. So the second year of 
his internship I got pregnant. And we were already ma rried then 
ten years. And we had no money and we had 
nothing but I kind of said to myself you know 

enough is enough. I was already 25.  We have to just 
eventually start a family. We  didn™t™ want a 

fa mily in Europe because there was no mil
k, there was no food.  Everybody was starving. We  

knew we had to go across to the United States. We
 didn™t know what we™re going to come  into. 
But as rough as it is you know children grow up 
anyways. You don™t™ have to have everything 
for them. So we decided we™re going to have this
 baby. And my little lady that I lived with was 
absolutely like a mother to me . I had a very hard
 time  at the beginning and she was there with a 
pot of soup every single night for me .  And sh
e really took care of me
.  She was very, very 

Interview with Lucine Horn 
28 
 
sweet. At that time  she didn™t work anymore. She™
s got a big part in my 
heart. So she kind of 
took care of me . And I still worked. I worked up un
til 7 or  8 months pregnant.  They were very 
nice to me . If I wasn™t feeling well they gave me
 a day off. I must say that they had a lot of 
respect for me . And I had my son a nd at that 
time I stopped working because there was no other 
way. Mothers didn™t work. Even if you had money or you didn™t have money, you didn™t work.  
My husband was ma king a total of $15 a month. I don™
t™ know if he told you that.  But at that 
time internships did not pay.  And out of the $15
 a month, he  had to give them $5 for laundry 
and the other ten he smoked away day and night. So
 there was practically 
nothing on his side that 
he could give me .  We had a little car and a tiny apartment

LUCINE HORN: and the other ten he smoked a way. Day and night. So there was practically 

nothing on his side that he could 
give me . We  had the little car 
and the tiny apartment. And we 
had a baby and as tiny as the apartment was, th
e baby was there you know. I mean there was just 
no other way. And we were quite happy. We  got 
a little cat.  And we waited for him t o 
fi nish the internship. 

 

Q: What did you name  your child? 

 

A: My, my s on is name d after my brother that I 
lost, the brother that was with me . Hi s name  was 
Gerald, David.  And my husband™s 
uncle lost a little boy by the na
me  of J e rry so my son is 
Gerald David which he hates until this very day but 
he has to forgive me , I can™t  help it.   So  
 
Q: One other thing I™m curious about. There 
you™re in a circumstance and you know a lot of 
people have been in the circumstance wher
e you™re you know you are still fairly young and 
you™re just getting started.  You don™t have the 
biggest apartment, you don™t™ have much money. 
You have a child.  You had all th
at going. But I™m also curious agai
n about what it was like, how 
it felt to you, what went through your mi nd and h
eart given what you had come  out of.  Given 
the fact that you were both surv
ivors of the holocaust and now 
here you are and you™re bringing 
this new life into the world. I™m curious about  

 

A: We felt good. We felt 

Interview with Lucine Horn 
30 
 
 
Q: Did you think of it in that way at all. 

 

A: Yes we felt that we™re here to
 stay.  We  want to raise a fam
ily. Soone r or later my  husband is 
going to ma ke it. It™s going to be rough at the 
beginning.  It wasn™t li
ke we thought we were 
doome d for life. I always had this future ahead of
 me  that he is going to ma ke it. And we were 
used to do with very little.  That™s how I gr ew up. I grew up knowing how to cook from nothing. 

I knew to make a soup from garbage.  That™s 
how I grew up.  We  didn™t have anything  during 

the war. And we had to sustain ourselves. When
 there was a piece of ol
d bread, we didn™t throw 
it out. You soaked it in milk and you ma de like this
 and you put in a littl
e sugar and you baked it. 
In the oven. That™s how I grew up.  So I guess we were. 

 

Q: You ma ke a cake out of it. 
 
A: Yes, we were finally ha
ppy. We  thought we arrived.  And 
we liked everything about the 
United States.  We  really did. We  liked the way the people we re.  We  liked the way the Jewish 

community everywhere embraced us. There wasn™t
 a holiday in Rochester New York that we 
weren™t invited to doctors™ homes for  dinner.  Sa
turday nights they invited us. At the hospital 
they had dinners with daddies at the cafeteria. A
nd the greatest thing, we 
lived not far away, took 
a buggy and the baby and in the baseme nt it was 
the biggest thing to had dinner with daddy 
because we never saw him.  I didn™t™ have to 
have washing ma chines and dr yers. I lived one 
flight up walking. Tiny little apartment. I had to
 take the baby every morning with a bag of 
diapers, soiled diapers on the buggy. Wa lk about 4 or
 5 blocks to the laundromat, put in a quarter 

Interview with Lucine Horn 
31 
 
to wash the diapers. But I could not spend anot
her quarter to dry them
 because I could hang it 
outside.  So the baby was sleeping. The diapers we
re being washed. I put another bag of laundry 
on the buggy. We nt back home , took him in the 
backyard, without lines hang the diapers out. 
And that™s the way we lived. And we were ver
y, very happy. I knew it is 
not forever. And I knew 
that it has to be that way.  Th
ere™s just no other way.  But we a
rrived to freedom, we arrived with 
people that are being good to us, th
at are being very encouraging to
 us. I did not have very much 
to do with my uncle at that time . Bec a use uncle 
constantly asked if he 
can help us.  And my 
husband constantly said I don™t need anything. 
Thank you. We  don™t need more clothes right 
now. We  don™t™ need fancy cars 
right now. We  don™t™ need a fa
ncy apartment right now. I™m 
going to arrive and I™m going to have it myself. You know I™d occasiona lly they™d send a, an 
outfit for the baby or some thing like that but we
 were proud and we felt we can ma ke it on our 
own. There was no necessity. They did enough for us and we appreciated it. 

 
Q: I™m must  curious. Leaving aside the material si
de of this and how all you had to do to be 
inventive to take care of yourself and your child in
 a situation.  In anothe
r sense a few years after 
the war, so ma ny millions of people killed. You and your husband both lost almost all of your 
fa milies.  And now you have brought this ne w bei
ng into the world. What  I™m curious about and 
ma ybe this isn™t the way you looked at it. I™m 
just curious whether you had any feelings or 
emotions or thoughts of like you know we are help
ing to in having this 
child you were bringing 
some thing back or you were helping to restore 
things or you know what I™m saying. And I don™t™ 
know. I wasn™t there but I™m curious
 wither you had any sense of  
 

Interview with Lucine Horn 
32 
 
A: We ll to tell you the truth we were too busy st
ruggling. There was no time  for to philosophize. 
To give you an example of how my husband work
ed.  There were three day shifts. He would 
start in the morning at 6: 00 on Monday  and 
he wouldn™t be home til We dnesday night. He 
would work all Monday, Monday night.  All Tu
esday, Tuesday night and Wednesday he would 
come  home  at 5. His feet were swollen from r
unning around.  Ok. I had to 
put his feet and soak 
it. He would have his dinner. He would hug the 
baby and go to sleep.  And Thursday morning we 
would try the same  sequence of three days.  Ther
e was very little togetherness. There was very 
little feedback. We  had no time to dwell upon a
nything. We  even had no time to communicate. 
When I was pregnant and very sick. I had to be
 there alone because he wa s not there for me.  
Because he couldn™t.  So on top of having financial hard time s, we had a very tough life.  He had 

to work 36 hours in a row. And I had to be the on
e to take care of my child. There was just on 

other way. There was no baby sitter. There was 
no money for  it. There was nothing.  And of 
course, not a car. I had to do everything, all my
 shopping and grocery shopping  and everything 
on that little buggy and walk to th e store and do it back and fort
h. I had nice people. I had nice 

neighbors but they weren™t really interested to 
do ma ny things for me .  So it was hard but we 
knew that we are in a land of freedom. We  appr
eciate being here.  Ever
y mi nute of the day. We  
didn™t dwell upon going back. Some  immi grants sa
id oh you know what in the old country they 
didn™t do it like that. They did 
it this way. For us it was everyt
hing that we found here was a 
plus and a positive feeling. We  did not think of
 ever going back because  ma ybe things were 
different over there. there was no going back. th
ere was only a black wall
 from what happened 
there and everything here was good and rosy.  We 
took the little blanket on a Sunday. We went 
to a Delaware park and we put the blanket on th
e, on the grass and the baby was laying then and 
my husband took a camera and took pictures. That 
was our happiness.  And we wanted to dwell 

Interview with Lucine Horn 
33 
 
on the happiness and not go back to the black year
s because  ot herwise we just me ntally could 
never ma ke it. I wanted to be a sound, psych, I 
mean a sound mother for my child. I wanted to 
give him some  sense of values.  I didn™t want th
em to have a frustrated mother who was thinking 
about what happened. What happene
d, happened.  It was hell. It wa
s terrible. It took my heart 
out. But here I am a young mother. I™m 25 years old. 
 I have to start my life and do the best out 
of it.  I cannot psychologically
 allow myself to do that beca
use I have now a husband that™s 
struggling. I have a, I have a child.  I want a fami
ly. I want these positive th
ings, even for myself.  
We had a group of people there that we used to 
meet. Mother, young mo thers that we were all in 
the same  predicament. We were helping each other. One had to go to the doctor. The ot her one 
was babysitting. You know, out of necessity. We
 always found nice people around us. I never 
felt that moving from town to town was such 
a struggle because there was always nice people 

around us. Whether it was from the Jewish committ
ee or was from the doctor™s or was from the 
resident. Wh en my son was born at the hospi
tal where my hus band was interning ok. We had 
zero money.  And we had nothing.  The girls in th
e office who were all single were so thrilled 
that I was pregnant that they 
didn™t know what to do for me . Th
ey wanted to buy me  everything. 
I said look it™s an old custom in Europe. You 
don™t buy anything, no showers.  I don™t want it. I 

just don™t™ believe in it. So they took money 
together and as soon as the baby was born, they 
bought a buggy. They bought me  a bassinette.  They 
bought whatever I needed. Wh en that baby 
was born, my husband got a little nurse from, from 
the nursery to come  with me  for a week and 
teach me  what to do with the baby.  There was no 
babies in my  fa mily. I never picked up a baby 
in my life. I was scared.  That 
little girl would not charge me  
a dime . She would come  over. She 
had a week off.  She would stay
 with me  and show me  how to 
diaper and wash the baby.  And 
she gave me  so much confidence.  So that wa
s wonderful. And then th
ere was another mi racle 

Interview with Lucine Horn 
34 
 
that I didn™t know happens in this country.  Ev
erybody brought gifts to the 
hospital.  There was 
27 residents and interns and nurses and the windo
w in the hospital. At that time you stayed a 
week. They didn™t, they didn™t throw you up, out 
like today.  The window in the hospital was full 
of stuff.  There was, they brought me diapers.
 They brought me  little outfits. They brought me  a 
little thing to take the baby home
. It was just a wonderful feeli
ng. I wasn™t forgotten. I wasn™t 
by myself.   People really did care.  By the 
time I came home, the baby had a lot of things 
already. And I kind of knew that you know havi
ng a baby is happiness and, and it™s going to 
work. It just absolute first. There were thi
ngs like being hand me  do
wns you know. There were 
people that were calling this lady that was te
aching my husband. And asking if the Horns need 
anything. Can we send some  linen to the house or can 
we send some  other things or do they need 
blankets. These people just really because of the sm
all town they wanted really to be helpful to 
us. And they were. So that™s how life was in Rochester, New York. And then my husband 

finished his internship and there was a big dilemm
a, what to do.  Because 
he still couldn™t™ get a 
permit to stay in New York stat e and get a license
 and he really wanted to get a license in New 

York state because he already had a lot of doctors
 that want ed him to work with them. And we 
already knew a lot of people there.  And he did 
want to get licensed fr
om New York State and 
they were ma king all kinds of trouble for him. At 
that time there was a law that whoever finished 
me dicine after the war in Vienna, 
cannot be allowed to, to take th
e boards. There was all kinds of 
changes and all kinds of politics going on. And the 
outcome  of it was that he just couldn™t get a 
license to practice right away.  
So we decided that he will ma
ybe become a house physician for a 
while because we needed some  money desperat
ely. And ma ybe he work on a salary to the 
hospital. And we didn™t want to do it in Rocheste
r because we found some very dear friends in 
Buffalo New York which was about only 70 mile
s away. And that wasa little bigger town. 

Interview with Lucine Horn 
35 
 
Buffalo had a million and Rochester had maybe 3
50,000. And I always like d to live in a little 
bigger town. So my husband got a job in the hosp
ital in Buffalo New York. At the very not too 
much of a salary but at least so
me  start. And we moved to Buffalo, New York to be with these 
friends that we knew from way b
ack. And unfortunately were there 
for 7 years. We  just couldn™t™ 
get out.  He was working and ma king some  mo
ney. And we bought a new car, because he always 
wanted a car on payment .  And I never could go 
back to work because I had the little boy. And 
we some how ma naged. It was nice
. We met an awful lot of dear
 friends. And we ma de a life 
there you know.  He was  getting a little bit more
 money and then he was out working nights so 
for the nights he was compensated extra and being a small town you really don™t need that much 

money. You pay monthly for a telephone $5. You 
know the expenses were much less.  We  
happened to find some  wonderful 
people that we rented from a nd it was very inexpensive and 
she became like a, like a mother to me and lik
e a nanny. She really helped me  bring up my 

children.  In the meantime I had another child, I had 
my daughter in Buffa lo, 
four years later.   
 

Q: What year was this now? 

 

A:  That was 56.  He was born in 52 and that was in 56.  And we, we had an awful lot of fun.  I 

had a lot of nice people but we 
were all together, one group of 
people from the Holocaust, trying 
to raise fami lies and trying to make a life for th
emselves.  Some  were in business. Some  were 
professional. They were just trying to establish 
a life. And we were helping each other. We  were 

visiting each other. We  had pa
rties together. And we just ha
d a very nice life. Except my 
husband was still on the job and he 
wanted to go on his own. And he tried all the time to be, be 
able to take the license in Ne
w York state. And Albany absolutely wouldn™t™ allow him to do 

Interview with Lucine Horn 
36 
 
this. After all that.   And that was very frustrat
ing.  Because we could never achieve anything the 
way he was working. His salary was $350 a mont h. 
I mean that wasn™t enough for a family to 
survive. And he really wanted to go out on hi
s own.  Even so, some  doctors, he was helping 
some  doctors occasiona lly and he was helping th
em during vacation but it
 was still very, very 
hard. And one day we were so frustrated and 
he kept on waiting and waiting and waiting.  And 
some  doctors tried through senators and you know 
political influences and all st uff like that. And 
then finally we decided that we™re going to 
go in person to Albany, New York and we™re going 
to speak to the head person over there in the e
ducation departme nt. And r
eally talk it over with 
him and ask him what we should do.  And we did 
that. We  we nt, was a very nice ma n at that 
time, an older ma n.  He sat down with us and he 
said Dr. Horn if I have to give you a good piece 
of advice, leave Buffalo tomorrow. There is a big 
United States and there is a lot of states that 
allow foreign trained physicians to take the 
boards and you can ma ke just as good a living if you 
go some place else.  I know it™s hard. You don™t know
 anybody but you just have to do it.  If you 
sit and wait here you™ll never probab
ly be able to practice in New 
York State. We didn™t™ realize 
that each state had a different, 
that this is a ma tter of federa
lism you know. It™s not like uniform 
for the whole country. And my husband decided to ta
ke the boards in Ohio and in Illinois and in 
1960 because we were three years, two years in Rochester. Then we were in Buffalo New York 
from 53 practically to 59.  Well 
he worked as a house physician. And then in 59 he came  to take 
the boards in November.  To Ohio and Illinois 
and he passed in both places. And because he 
really loved Chicago he deci
ded, we decided to move. And 
in 1960 in February.  My son 
was seven or 7 and a half; my daughter
 was four. We moved to Chicago. 
 

Q: And he had been to Chicago and 
decided this is where he wanted 

Interview with Lucine Horn 
37 
 
 
A: He only came here to take the boards, but he 
met some ni ce people. He met some doctors.  He 
made some, he made some contact with people 
that told him they would help him to get on 
boards, on staff of the hospital and maybe even 
give him a job. You know he wanted to work 
with some body for a while.  Because moving to Ch
icago was a big expense, first of all. And 
second of all he, the last six months before he
 took the boards he was not working because he 
really had to prepare for the boards.  It was ve
ry hard to take the boa
rds and he could not be 
working and doing these things. So that completely
 exhausted our savings.  And he the cost of 
living was ten times as much as in Buffalo. So he
 really needed a job and he came out here a few 
times, ma de some  contacts and got a job with anot
her doctor, on a salary.  And when we moved 
we got a little apartment. It was on the west si
de in Elmwood park so th
at we can he can be 
closer to the practice.  

 
Q: I was just curious.  He had been here ev
en though it was briefly, when you moved to come  
out here, had you even been here at all.  
 

A: Yes, I was here twice 

 

Q: OH ok 

 

A: We  loved Chicago.  Through some acquaintances
 we me t an awful lot of nice people. Before 
I was even living here.  We were i
nvited to a party, we were invited 
to dinner and it was just very 
nice people that we me t.  And we we re very enco
uraged to move to Chicago rather than to he 

Interview with Lucine Horn 
38 
 
loved the city and so did I. And we always like 
to live in a big city. So we decided to move 
and in 1960 in February we moved. We had a little apartment. Not far away where my husband 
was working. He was working very hard. He took 
all the night calls. Practically ran the office for 
the other doctor, cause the other do
ctor went in for a specialty. He
 wanted to get a specialty so 
for the big practice and Felix ran the practi
ce. But he wasn™t happy being with some body 
because he ha s to do things his own way.  He
, he understands me dicine his own way.  His 
rapport with patients is very spec
ial and, and maybe a little differ
ent than this American doctor 
was.  And he was always dreaming after all thes
e years and he was already ten years later than 
most other doctors. He wa nted to go into prac
tice. By then he was 
already on staff of t wo 
hospitals and he needed a little c
ourage because he  was afraid to just put up a shingle because he 
still had a wi fe and two children to support. And 
there was no talk about me  going to work. That 
never existed in my hea d. I would never leave my children with some body else and go to work. I 

mean I just wouldn™t do it. I would wait until my 
husband can do a better, give me a better life.  
But I never thought of do, none of my  friends every di
d it. At that time  it wasn™t even in style. 
There was no places to leave these children.  Ther
e was nobody  to take care of them.  There was 
no immi gra nt people that would take care of children
 at that time. You just had to raise your own 
fa mily and that was it.  And that was a pleasure. 

 

Q: I should ask you. We  didn™t say your daughter 
was born what year and what did you name  
here. 

 

A: Oh I don™t know. I just liked Linda so I name d her Linda. 

 

Interview with Lucine Horn 
39 
 
Q: Ok so your son got the name s of r e latives 
and then your daughter got a name  that you liked. 
 
A: Yes, that™s all. And at that time I didn™t™ ev
en know that it means beautiful in Spanish. Now I 
do. And we moved here and he was working. A
nd then I kind of encouraged him to go on 
his own. He was not happy with this other doctor.
 And I knew it™s not going to work out for him. 
 So some how with very humble beginnings, he
 started out his own practice. He succeeded 
right away. He was very well like
d. His ma nners were just fabulous
. People just loved him. He 
deliver ed babies. He was in genera l pr actice. 
He was doing a lot of things with families and 
generations of fa milies. And he had a small 
offic e  at the beginning and then we bought the 

house. And we always kind of thought we have 
good thoughts. We  thought 
we™re going to ma ke 
it and we did.  And I always stood behind him a
nd always encouraged him to, to you know to do 
these things and take risks.  A
nd he was very happy in his small office at the beginning but then 
there was an opportunity to buy a 
small building. He always wanted
 to have his own place.  So 
we bought this building.  In 19, I really don™t recall.
  86 he sold it. It wa
s 25 years old. It must 
have been 61.  He bought a small building and he 
had ten rooms. He had a very nice practice. 
Very nicely furnished and I was raising my fami ly. And always wanted to finish college because 

I never finished. As soon as we 
left Vienna there was no sense for me  to, to sit around and get a 
degree. So as soon as my children went to school
 full time, I went back to Rosewood University 
and got my ma sters. And some how never work
ed because my husband liked to take  long 
vacations and I started to work for school  syst
em and was teaching German. That was my ma jor 
and it was always a conflict with v
acations so I didn™t™ want to be 
deprived.  I just didn™t™ have 
the freedom to do what I wanted. And he was ma
king a good living so I really didn™t have to 
work anymore. And I decided to go back to school
, finish school.  And it wasn™t until way into 

Interview with Lucine Horn 
40 
 
his practice. I always wanted to he
lp in his practice, but he always
 said that it™s just not proper 
for a wife to help.  And until there was an acci
dent  in the offi ce that his nurse broke her hip 
and then we couldn™t™ replace the nurse.  And I st
arted to work for him. And I worked for him for 
nine years. And when he sold his office, I am 
working now ten years for my son. So I™ve always 
been doing some thing. And the experience and the 
privilege of being a full time mother and not 
having to really go out of home  
and stay with my children has so
 tremendously paid off. Because 
my children always appreciated are just so close that
 we just could not be a closer family there is. 
My children always knew that we are just orphans. 
 And that just the four of us and nobody else.  
And they always knew that they have to be extr
a sensitive. And that™s how wonderful with us 
and we felt the same  thing with them. Because none of us had anybody else. There was not a 
grandma, and an uncle and an aunt and a cous
in. They had nobody. They just had us.  And we 
just had to be there for them. He, the, their 
father was not home. My hus band put in tremendous 
late hours.  Seven days a week. A
nd I knew that if I go or if I do 
things in the evening and get a 
sitter, these children are just 
not going to have a parent ar
ound.  And some how my biggest 
pleasure was to be with them, until this very day.
 It still it™s the same way. We just are very 

happy to be with each other.  Even so they are 
grown now and they have 
their own families. But 
we just have a tremendous relationship with each ot
her.  And this is in a 
wa y the gratification of 
my life.  Because I always feel
 that if god took away my parents when I was 12, and all this 
horror was happening to me , maybe he repaid me in 
a certain gratification that I am still at  that  

age here, sound mi nd.  And I can enj
oy the fruit of my life and I can
 enjoy and be with children 
who have never moved away, who live in the sa
me  town.  Who are so close and that we 
understand each other so well.  And I always feel that there is ma ybe
 a certain gratification in life 

and this was the compensation of all 
the ills that I had in my life. 

Interview with Lucine Horn 
41 
 
 
Q: Can I ask you how much did your children 
learn about your particular story and your 
husband™s and the Holocaust. Wh
at age did that start at? 
 

A: Well I would say that from the very beginn
ing when they understood when they were ma ybe 
12, 14 years old, when I my son was bar mitzvah, we
 always told them what happened to them. 
You know they were always looking for grandpare
nts and grandmothers  
and grandfathers. Their 
friends had it and we alwa ys had to tell them
 what  happened. And we were piecemeal. We  were 
telling them. For instance we used to go on vacation and I could spend two, three weeks sitting at 

the beach sitting next  to my children. Especia
lly next to my daughter.  And I would tell her 

piecemeal stories of what happened. At the beginni
ng I didn™t want to shoc k them because they 
were you know sensitive and young. 

 
Q: Would you wait for them to ask ques
tions or would you bring things up? 
 
A: They would ask questions but I mostly was te
lling them my life stor y. 
I made an audiotape a 
little bit on my tape recorder. They were asking 
questions and they wanted to know and we told 
them. We fe lt good about telling th
em of what happened. It wasn
™t until they became all gr own 
up and understood more and maybe because of their 
feelings towards us, they felt that they felt 

uncomfortable thinking how hurt we were.  They bega
n to feel very sorry for us that we  had to 
go through this experience. And they
 were treating us very tenderly and very specially. Like they 
would want to spare us the thought all these 
bad thoughts that we went through. And it reached 

Interview with Lucine Horn 
42 
 
a point where my children had not seen the tapes 
that you just viewed from the Holocaust. They 
each had a se t in the safe because they sent us three copies. 
 

Q: These are the interviews you did 
with the museum. A couple years ago. 

 

A: Yes, yes and they probably are going to se
e it after they, after we™r e gone. But they just 
cannot bring themselves to listen any more now to
 all these stories. And I have to tell you that 
they didn™t go to see Schindler™s List. My son 
saw Shoah and he™s never been the same . And my 
daughter who cries at weddings, that
™s how sensitive she is, she™s re
ally the last person that can 
take it. So they do know and they 
do read, but as far as asking ques
tions constantly, it hurts them.  
They™re protective of us. They unde
rstand now that they are getting 
old.  They feel bad. We  were 
going like to lecture and we lectured
 a few years ago. Lately we find 
that it™s much harder to talk 
about it, because when you get older you know, your 
nerves are shattered and we cry more when 
we tell the story.  We  cry more when we think ab
out it. So they want to spare us this. They 
just want us to live righ
t now as long as we have without rea
lly going into it.  When I tell them 
that I™m going to see a movie or when I told them
 that I went  to see Sc
hindler™s List, I watched 
some thing on television, they get really upset beca
use they feel it™s not for us to go through it. 
It™s for the other people to go and watch you know. 
 They don™t want to hurt us more than we do. 
And then this thing came  up about a few months
 ago that ma ybe my brother could be alive you 
know so they both went absolutely crazy. Even 
the grandchildren and I don™t know. I had some  
very false hopes. I don™t know if th
ey™re false. It™s possible that he
 is alive but we are now in the 
process of trying to see. If
, if this is really so a
nd what™s going to happen.  
 

Interview with Lucine Horn 
43 
 
Q:  Right. I should just say for the record here th
at in your video testimo
ny and then in the audio 
interview that I did with your husband the othe
r day he told the stor
y of how you lost your 
younger brother and he was tricked 
and the whole thing with the 
phony resort and that after the 
war, as far as you knew that he had not survived.  A
nd that in the last month 
or so or in the last 
few months you™ve gotten some  infor mation that he
 ma y well have survived and you™re trying to 
possibly locate him. 

 

A: And I mi ght just not ever find him.   

 

Q: So that that has been covere
d. That story was talked about in 
other interviews. I don™t know if 
you want to say anything 
about it.  Be my guest. 
 

A: I told the story in my inte
rview about how I lost him and what happened in that time. and 
there isn™t too much not t
oo much has been written about this simp
le incident of this hotel that he 
was, that he went with.  (no sound) There isn™
t too much not too much 
has been written about 
this simple incident of this hot
el  t h at  he was t h at  
he went with. But the Holocaust Museum was 
very helpful to me  and they found the book at the 
library and they sent it to me .  And this book 
covers everything that happened 
at that time  so it™s been doc
umented.  And coincidentally 
yesterday I had company here. And some body 
s a w this book laying around.  And they 
opened up the book and they found some body t hat they know who survived.  So now I™m going 

to try to contact this person and see if ma
ybe they know anything you know. But it™s been a 
search.  It™s certainly gave me a little encour
agement knowi ng that ma ybe even if I never find 

him that he mi ght be alive. And if I find him or 
not that™s another story.   But I™m happy to share 

Interview with Lucine Horn 
44 
 
all my thoughts with whoever is going to ever
 see it and read it and 
I mus t  add that the 
enthusiasm and the happiness  
that this country has given me
 and I know my husband too, it™s 
really been my country. I mean I cherish Israel a
nd I go there very often and this is really a part 
of me. My father was a Zionist
 and he was founder of a youth gr
oup in my home  town. He is 
written up in several books. I grew up in a Zionist home. I neve
r thought of myself that I™m 
not going to live in Palestine because I really want
ed to be there. My father was 25 years old. He 
went to Palestine to live there with my mother.  
And he got very sick with ma laria, and returned. 
I still have relatives that tell 
me  all that.  And I ne
ver thought of myself as
 not living in Israel. 
Israel is a part of me . But I have been very, ve
ry happy and I think both of
 us now agree that we 
ma de the right choice to come  to the United States
 and more or less now things are very bad here 
too as far as safety is concerned. But at least th
ings weren™t that bad and 
I didn™t™ have to worry 
about my children being shot all 
the time  and going into the army
 again. And I feel that this 
country is my home . I am very pa
triotic towards that country and 
I really, it really hurts me  to 
see how things have been recently and how th
is country has gone down, and down and down and 
it™s not really a country I came to in the 50s and 
60s. The United States gave the opportunity to 

all my friends who really rebuilt 
their lives, educated 
their children.  Started out from nothing.  
And some how through hard work and being frugal 
and being thrifty and being ma ybe believing 
in God in their own way, and showing their chil dren the values and wanting to educate their 

children and better themselves. They have all ar
rived and they have al
l achieved. This is the 
group of people I am with and I must say that ev
en American people admi re that very much.  
They really admi re this group of immi grants th
at came in, in the 1950s and really helped build 
this country up after the war. We  we re part of
 it and we™re very proud of it, even though we 
didn™t™ fi ght for this country. But we really feel
 and that™s why right now I am so disillusioned 

Interview with Lucine Horn 
45 
 
when I see all these ugly things th
at are happening here and the inse
curities that children have to 
be brought up.  Even my grandchildren I mean. Ther
e is no safety for them. There is no security. 
It™s just rough, it™s very rough now
. And we ca me to this countr
y things weren™t like this. We  
were walking around in the mi ddle of the night. 
We never locked our doors. I wasn™t worried 
when my kids went away, when they were driv
ing, when they were going places. Now it™s just 
constant , constant fear. And I hope that ma ybe 
it will take a couple of years or so and ma ybe 
things are going to be back to where they were be
fore. If at all possible.Because it could also be 
a global phenomenon. Maybe it™s just not the United States. 
 

Q: You me ntioned to me  that th
ere had been a change in your children and that now they don™t™ 
want to talk about the Holocaust and they want 
to sort of spare you any further sorrow because of 

that. I™m curious, when did that happen?  
How old were they when they changed. 
 
A: When they became grown human beings. I 
mean you know my son was a student  and when 
he became a father himself he understood it more. And I think with my daughter the same. It 
evolved by them going into our shoes.  My daught
er feels the privilege of
 having a mother and a 
father so strongly that when she th
inks that I didn™t™ have it, it just
 breaks her heart. It absolutely 
breaks her heart.  She constantly
 tells me look at my little girl
. She™s got two grandma ™ s and two 
grandpa™s.  And you know I didn™t have it but I 
know it, she understood what it meant for me 
being 13 years old and not to have a mother.  
Because she herself at the age of 40 needs me  

every single day. So they became mo re aware of
 it when they became grown huma n beings. You 
know what I mean. I don™t know if I™m expressing
 it well. But when they became parents and 
when they see what™s going on, it just they unde
rstood what we went through.  Regardless of the 

Interview with Lucine Horn 
46 
 
fact that people were killed in gas chambers 
and everything else. That™s the global tragedy that 
happened during the war to six million Jews. But on a 
personal level they relate to our lives. And 
that™s very painful to them and very importa
nt. I don™t know if that 
answers your question. 
 

Q:  It does. You me ntioned your son saw Shoah 
and you said, I think the exact way you said it 
was he was never the same  a fter that. What happened. 

 

A: He just told me  that he doesn™t wa nt to see th
ese things again. He just 
can™t bear it.  He cannot 
bear it because his own pa rents were so invol
ved in it. And his own grandparents could have 

been layi ng there in the ditch.  He just ca
nnot face up to and he just cannot take it. 
 

Q: And then a movie like Schindler™s List come
s out and your son wouldn™t see it, what about 
your daughter, did she, 
she wouldn™t see it. 
 
A: No, no. 

 

Q: But you saw it. Did your husband see it. 

 

A: Yes we went. We  saw the first week when it was 
in, in, I feel to a certain extent it™s my duty 
to go and see these things. It™s my duty to go to Ya d Va™shem.  It™s my duty, I was three times at 

the Holocaust Museum. To a certain extent in 
my  duty but I can™t punis
h myself. I cannot spend 
sleepless ni ghts because every time I see some
thing like that you know it works on me. I don™t™ 

sleep for three days. So at this
 stage of my life I can™t be 
punished anymore. I have been 

Interview with Lucine Horn 
47 
 
punished already. It™s not going to help the worldand it™s not going to help the me mor y of my 
parents if I punish myself at my 
age r i ght now.   I have done it. I 
have lived it. I experienced it. I 
can tell about it.  But it gets hard
er and harder.  And I know that a lot of people can™t even talk 
about it anymore. I was a child and I lost my pa
rents but I have friends 
who lost children.  They 
lost wives.  And they cannot talk 
to their children, to their present children and fa mily about it at 
all. They ma de a wall. They don™t™ wa nt to talk a
bout it.  This is their pa
st life. They want their 
life now.  People react to these th
ings in a completely di fferent 
way. I was a child. I came  to the 
United States. I was 20 some  years old. I could adju
st to the life here. I completely acclimatized 
myself to the life in the United States.  I becam
e so absorbed with th
e life that I became an 
American.  And I understand when 
people are a certain age and the 
same  is with experiences.  
Some  people had such experiences that they real
ly don™t want to talk about it. And they don™t 
want to tell their children because maybe they 
think that they want 
to spare them. You know 
there™s all kinds of, you cannot really it™s not a unif
orm feeling and a unifor m 
way to deal with it. 
Everybody has to do it on their own level.   

 

Q: I know that in some families it has caused 
problems between parent s and their children. 

 

A: What kind of problems?  

 

Q: We ll tension. The children feel a burden toward
s their parents that they
 can never really live 
up to.  There have been st udies in books about th
is. I mean some  fa milies do well. Othe rs do not.   
 

Interview with Lucine Horn 
48 
 
A: I will tell you. I have a tremendous amount of fr
iends from the Holocaust. I live in New York. 
I lived in Rochester.  I lived in Buffa lo. I st
ill know about 120 fa milies in Buffalo. I™m here  
surrounded by people from the Holocaust. We are very
 social. I know an awful lot of people. I 
never encountered a family that had a problem
 with children. If they had problems it was 
because of di fferent, because of different reasons
.  They could have personality clashes. They 
could have been parents that ma ybe dema nded 
too much from their 
children. Their children 
couldn™t deliver. Maybe through their lives, ma ybe th
ey wanted to live thei
r lives through their 
children™s lives you know. There™s a
ll kinds of different circumstances.  I™m not saying that 
everybody is living in peace. But that wasn™t our cas
e.  In my case I feel that my children are 
very norma l, very well adjusted.  We  try to give th em a very solid sense of values.  I don™t™ think 

my children are absolutely affected. I mean they 
are affected because of what we went through  
but their life and their relationship with the fam
ily, I don™t think has been affected at all because 
of the fact that they are surv
ivors of, they are children of su
rvivors. They have never been 
embarrassed of us. They have never been ashame
d of us. They have always been very proud. 
And they put us on a certain pedestal. You know
 like a wounded bird. Because we were the ones 
that they have to shelter now and help us and 
that was always the relationship. They always 
understood.  And we always had a good relationshi
p with each other. And so do my friends. I 
mean I really don™t know of anybody, unless there™
s all ki nds of circumstances in families you 

know where parents don™t see eye 
to eye with the children. And th
ere™s all kinds of tension but 
that™s not only people fr om the Holocaust.  That goes on in other fa milies.  

 

Q: When you and your husband ar
e leading your lives together doe
s it come  up much anymore? 
 

Interview with Lucine Horn 
49 
 
A: We ll I have to tell you the tr
uth. My husband likes to
 talk about it.  Not with me , but with 
other people.  I like to ke
ep it to mys e lf. I would not talk abou
t it to just anyone. If I have to tell 
the kids at the Hillel foundation at 
Northwestern, I tell them
. If I have to talk to a gr oup at my 
temple, I™ll tell them. But I don™t 
think that every Amer
ican Joe not only has a right, but they 
don™t™ have to know wha t ™s going on in my, in a s
oul. If they want to know some thing about the 
Holocaust there is books,
 there is mo vies, there is everyt
hing else. I don™t™ think they even 
understand it. I don™t think they ha
ve a way of fe eling and unders
tanding it 50 years afterwards. 
My husband could go on a vacation and meet pe
ople at the pool. And he would tell them 
everything. I™m not that way. I™m more into mys e
lf.  If they ask me  
I could tell them a few 
things. But I would not open up my wounds and my 
scars and tell them everything that happened 
to me .   As far as between us well, we, we go ba
ck to it. We  just put me morial plaques in the 
temple for all our parents you know, his sister.  
We read about it. We  you know are very attuned 
to what happens with anti-Semitism here, with  pe ople that wr ite books about that the Holocaust 
never happened. About the attitude of people 
here towards what happened you know.  We ™re 
very attuned to that. But after so ma ny we just 
don™t sit and dwell aboutit you know.  I just had a 
reproduction ma de of my  father™s picture and now 
this thing with my brother and of course we 
are it™s part of our life. It has not been erase
d, by no means. But it™s not part of our every day™s 
life. You know my husband recently, he™s sensi
tive and now that he says you know what. I 
would give to have a picture of my sister. I 
am beginning to forget what she looked like. You 
know. And he told this to my kids and then my ki
ds talked to me . He says ma  is there any way 
that you think of that we can get dad a picture 
of his sister. And I said honey I know everything 
about his life.  And this is just impossible. Ther
e is nobody in this world th
at I think could have a 
picture. I have a picture of my br
other. He has pictures of his pa
rents and I have pictures of my 

Interview with Lucine Horn 
50 
 
parents. But he doesn™t™ have a pi
cture of his sister and I know th
at he would like to. And I think 
you know when you get older you become  more sens
itive to these things
. And I really don™t 
think that he should be now talking about and lect
uring. The fe w times that we lectured, that he 
lectured, he broke down, he really did. I think ou
r resistance is getting kind of shaky right now 
and I™m not surprised I heard from interviewers th
at when people get into the 80s even if they 
reme mber, they just don™t want to be put through 
that experience of talking. That™s why we have 
to hurry and do it. Because it is
 very painful and when you™re younger you take it better, much 
better than when you get older. You think abou
t the past and your life 
and everything else.  
 
Q:  You know there is this thing which has 
been happening off and on or more and more 
depending on how you look at it where there are pe
ople who maintain it didn™
t™ happen or it™s 
been highly exaggerated, all that. The people w
ho lived through it a lot of them are no longer 
around and everyone is getting up in 
years. Do you think about or 
worry about the time  when the 
time comes when there are no longer survivor
s who are alive and whether the world will 
reme mber. The world will forget. Does that
 topic, do you think about that at all. 
 

A: No I really don™t think about 
it. I really don™t™ thi
nk about it because I f
eel that I have done 
everything I could. I leave a legac
y. I told my story. My children know. they each have the tapes. 
I lived through the horror and I™ll di e with it.  
And the world is rotten anyways. And they™re 
going to try to do whatever they want to. They ha
ve never been fair to 
the Jews. They™re going to 
try to, there are always going 
to be people that are going to
 say it never happened. There™s 
always going to be anti-Se mitism. Unfortunately. And you know genocide is happeni ng every 

single day and all over the world. So apparently this
 is the structure of people. It™s dog eat dog. I 

Interview with Lucine Horn 
51 
 
don™t know. Look at what™s happening now. I m
ean look what happened now in beautiful 
Yugoslavia where I was seven year
s ago on a vacation. And I can™t fo
rget that country. I me an 
people were just doing it to themselves. It™s just
 unbelieva ble. And little me at my age with my 
experiences just can™t take care 
of that any more. I leave it to
 the younger generation. I cannot at 
this stage of my life worry about these things. 
I like to be around for as long as I can. I have 
unfortunately my children got ma rried late. Th
ey weren™t ma rried in their 20s. They were 
ma rried in their 30s, ma ybe because they had it so
 good at home . Or this is just the way life was 
for t h em. 
 

Q: IT™s getting later all the time. 

 

A: But I am very grateful that they did it and 
we do have now 11 for dinner for the holidays from 
four. And I just would like to live long enough to
 enjoy my family now. The fruit of my labor, 
the fruit of my life. Life is sweet and good and 
we are having a wonderful time and we can still 

travel  and we  can still afford things and we can 
still enjoy each other.  And we are still together 

after 54 years.  So I just want a simple life right
 now. I don™t want to I™m past the stage where I 
can change the world. I leave it up to the younger people. 

 

Q: You arrived in New York on Thanksgiving an
d your husband me ntioned this to me too the 
other day. When you have Thanksgi
ving dinner your children and gr
andchildren all get together 
for Thanksgiving.   Do you do anything special? 

 

Interview with Lucine Horn 
52 
 
A: Yes, we always tell them the story and we alwa
ys ma ke sure that they know that we arrived to 
the United St ates on Thanksgiving and we count th
e years every time  we have our turkey. And I 
make sure that I make it, not my daughter in la
w, not my daughter. This 
is my personal pleasure 
because it has a certain meaning to 
me  and I am just very grateful 
that I can do it and that I have 
my fa mily around me . And we support the Holocaus
t Museum. We  support a
ll these ventures of 
me morizing everything and trying to
 reme mber and write about it and in our own way we feel 
that we just did as much as we could.  I cannot
 carry the burden of th
e world now any more.  I 
think I did my share. I had my burden.  And the 
life now at our age is ju
st getting up in the 
morning every day, being able to func tion, not to be
 a burden and to have each other. And this is 
the philosophy of most peopl
e that are older.  And of course we
 are very much aware of what is 
going on and I am a very political person. I am a ve
ry political person and 
I love politics and I 
love to listen to all the analysis
 and unfortunately I don™t get it fr
om the media because the media  
is too wise for me. 
 
Q: Which way do you think is
 best, left or right. 
 

A: Oh the media is comp letely left.  I mean ther
e is question about it. I 
think the me dia should be 
unbiased.  I think that media should
 report and not take sides. I thi
nk that is just not fa ir.  And 
especially to people that don™t unde
rstand things so well and just li
sten to what me dia tells them. 
And I don™t know. I just part of 
this life in America.   
 

Q: Some thing that just popped in
to my head that I wonder about is whether you have aversions 
to certain things or certain pe
ople. What are your feelings towa rds Germany. You™re here in 

Interview with Lucine Horn 
53 
 
Chicago, the tremendous number of Jewish people. This is also, outside of Wa rsaw the biggest 
Polish city in the world.  A country that you™re 
not a big fan of. I™m wondering whether there are 
things you ha ve where you don™t™ want to ha
ve anything to do with certain places or 
 

A: Yes, definitely. I am a very opinionated pers
on. I have a very strong 
mind of my own.  And I 
was offered to go to Auschwitz and ma ke a movi
e by Boston University or some body in Boston.  

The Holocaust Museum had them call me . And th
e only condition was there was supposed to be 
a movie called Wo me n of the Holocaust. Ther
e we re four wome n going to Auschwitz. They 
wanted to shoot on location. My foot will never 
step on the Polish soil under any circumstances, 
except if I will know that my brot
her is there. I™ll go look for him. I severed all my ties with 
Poland.  I have a lot of unfortunate ba d feelings, ill 
feelings about the people there. Ma ybe this is 
not just but I can™t he lp it. This is a place which is absolutely does not exist for me  to go any 

more.  I would never travel to Germany. I will ne
ver go there on vacation.  I tolerate the German 
people because I try to tell myself that the pr
esent generation, ma ybe 
now after 55 years didn™t 
know what they were doing. Also according to th
e new book they did,  but 
these were still their 
parents and grandparents and when I see a German 
that™s 75 years old, I c
ould not go even near 
him. Because I know he was a Nazi and he was ki
lling the Jews.  But when I see a German that™s 
25 or 30 years old I can™t feel th
at way because it wouldn™t™ be right. When I see a Polish person 
30 years old I know that his father told him to ha
te the Jews.  Because the Polish people have it 
in thei r blood. They were, they did not kill or help kill the Jews but they hated the Jews fr om 

time i mme morial . Before the war they were beati
ng up Jewish students.  Before the war in 20s 
and 30s they didn™t want to have the Jewish 
people living in Poland. It dates back, way back 
before even Hitler existed.  You see. So actua
lly anti-Semitism I think in Poland goes way back

before any other countries knew about it. 
Of course, the Spanish you know during the 
Inquisition, we can™t talk about
 that.  That was in the 15
th
 century. But I have very strong feelings 
about certain groups of people. I, as
 I said this is the way I feel 
about it.  I just
 can™t help it. 
 
Q: What about if you™re just going around town 
and you go into one of the parts of Chicago 
that™s still Polish 

 

A: I don™t like to go. 

 

Q: You don™t go. 

 

A: I don™t like to go no.  I just 
don™t like to go there.  And I al
so don™t like to have a cleaning 
lady that™s from Poland. I have a very nice lady that
 cleans for me  for 35 years.  She™s like part 
of my fa mily. I, it™ just bothers me . It justbothe rs me . Because I know how much they hate the 

Jews. My husband doesn™t feel that wa y but I do.  
He went back to Poland. He™s sentimental. He 
wanted to see his school and his 
house and his apartment. I couldn™
t take it.  Maybe because he 
was in hiding and I was exposed. I wa s exposed ev
ery single day to people 
that wanted to kill 
me . Not only Germans. Poles. Every day. When I 
tried to ma ke a living. These people were nice 
to me  because they di dn™t™ know and they constantly
 talked to me  about Jews.   Maybe this is the 
reason. I don™t know.  Also my husband lived befo
re the war 20 years in 
Poland. I only lived 13 
years there. I have no ties with 
schools or high schools.  Or even 
Polish literature I wasn™t taught. 
With hi m it was different so I just don™t™ have these sentimental feelings towards Poland. It was a

country I was born in and unfortunately I was grow
ing up there and that™s it.
  It™s all over with 
for me . I™m American.  I™m Israeli, I™m Jewish. 
I™m proud of it and it™sjust fine with me .  
 

Q: I don™t have any more questions. Is there anyt
hing that we haven™t talk
ed about that you want 
to talk about or that you™d 
like to finish by saying.  
 

A: We ll I think I summar ized everything pretty 
we ll. You know to tell 
you the present state  
of affairs and my feelings. And ju
st the fact that I™m very happy and grateful for what I have and 
I™ve always been that way. I try 
to instill these values in my 
children too. And sometimes things 
matter more than material  things. Unfortunately this is a material world ri ght now. But we have 

always ma de it with very little and I grew up in
 a home  where these values were passed on by 
my parents too. They were two professional peop
le. I cherish their me mor y. They taught me  
everythi ng I know.  I ma ybe became a very secure 
person in life because I was a very secure 
child. I was wanted.  I was loved.  I was need
ed. I was respected and I was always brought up 
with parents, with two parents being there. A
nd it was my youth was just, my childhood was just 
so happy.  And they were always telling me  whet he
r I was five or six, that I am nice and that I 
am pretty and that I am a  good girl
 and that that security has lived
 with me  all my life, no matter 
what people would throw at my face and tell me  
that I™m bad, that I™m Jewish and I™m this and 

I™m that and genocide you know. I kind of always fe
lt this within me.  And I™m trying to, I tried 

always to give this to my children. I think 
it™s very important. Also I never was under any 
psychiatric or psychological car
e and I felt that I can do it myself, that I can overcome certain 
hurdles in my life by my self because I had this 
inner strength because my mom used to tell me 
that I am just a very nice little girl and very 
important to them and loved and that I™m going to

ma ke it if I believe in myself.  And I always di
d.  And I think with the 
spectrum of what you see 
what™s happening now is the breakup of the fa
mily and fatherless children and god knows what™s 
happening in the world. You know. I 
think that this is ma ybe the 
root of all evil. That ma ybe 
people that grew up in secure homes are just goi
ng through life in a muc h easier way than people 
that are just uprooted and don™t™ know wher
e they belong and don™t™ know whether some body 
wants them or needs them.  Or you know or they 
can contribute to societ
y or not. I just always 
had that pleasant inner feeling  
that my parents instilled in me 
for the 12 short years that I lived 
with them. And that really helped me all my lif
e. And I tried to pass it on to my children and 
ma ybe that helped them to be to be good people 
and see the world in a certain way. And when I 
compare now for instance my daughter™s upbr
inging and her way of thinking and living 
comparing to ma ybe her peers, she always tells 
me  mo m w h a t e v er  I  k n o w  i s
 from you. I am what  
you taught me  to be and it ma kes me  feel good, b
ecause she™s a very nice person and so is my  
son. And my son™s father was always, always an
 example to him. Always.  And ma ybe that™s 
very important for fami l i es to be.  I don™t™ want
 to sound too philosophical but you wa nted me  to 
finish in a certain way so I just
 am doing that on the side.   
 
Q: thanks for taki ng all this time. 

 

A: You™re welcome.
