[Applaus e]
 
> > Bill Bens on:  J acques, thank you s o muc h for joining us and for your willingnes s  to be our
 
First 
Person
 
today.
 
>
>  J acques Fein:  Thank  you.
 
> > Bill Bens on: We'll get s tar ted.  We have just about an hour and we have a lot to c over  s o we'll s tart.  
 
 
J ac ques , Wor ld War II began in Septem ber
 
1939 with Germ any's  invas ion of Poland.  The 
following May Germ any invaded Franc e.  You were just 1
 
1/2 years old.  Before we tur n to the war  
year s , tell us what you can knowing that you were s o young, tell us what you c an about your  parents  
and their life and what you think it m ay have been like for them in prewar  Par is , again, kn
owing that 

you're too young to have m em or ies of your own from that time.
 
> > J acques Fein:  The main thing is  that I was  born in 1938 and I was  11 months old when the Wor ld 
War II started and ended in 1945.  So the firs t three or four  year s  I knew v er y, ver
y 
--
 
I remember very, 
very little.  I don't even r em em ber  m y parents  at all.  That's number one.  
 
 
People always  as k me how did I feel.  So I tell the truth.  I was  just plain too young to really 
internalize what was  happening.  Onc e I was  a bit older, I under stood through doc uments.  So my 

3 
 
m em or y of m y par ents is  zero.  As  you m entioned, later , I was  in hiding for about thr ee or four years.  I 
do rem em ber  being in hiding outs ide of Fr anc e.  We have doc um ents wher e I had been.
 
 
It was  not as "
d
anger ous" as
 
Poland where Ger mans  and Nazis  wer e all over  the plac e but 
the family who took  c are of m e had to be ver y, very c areful bec aus e any day, you know, ther e wer e 
Germ ans and Frenc h polic e looking for res is tanc e fighter s , J ews  who had escaped.  I r em ember even 
one tim e during that tim e, m aybe it was  1943 or 
`
44, or 
`
42, that in a dis tanc e
 
--
 
well, the father of the 
family put my s is ter  and I in a ditc h.  I didn't know why.  Jus t followed what I was told.  And to this day I 
s till rem em ber seeing in a dis tanc e maybe 150
 
yards  or s o s oldier s with guns  and dogs.  And I realized 
later on that they were looking for es c apees or  J ews  or  res is tanc e fighters .  So we were very, ver y 

luc ky.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  J acques, befor e we turn to the period wher e you wer e in hiding, knowing that you were 
s o young and you've had to
, 
to the best ability you c an, piec e things  together later, mos tly thr ough 
s eeing doc um ents
.  D
o you know anything about your  parents' lives  in Franc e
 
--
 
exc us e m e, in Poland 
pr ior  to their  m ove to France?
 
>> Jac
ques Fein:  All I k now is  that they wer e poor.  They em igrated to Par is , Franc e, in the ear ly 
`
30s  
to es c ape the anti
-
Semitis m of Poland and for better ec onom ic c onditions .  I under stand ther e wer e 
m any other
 
--
 
well, a num ber of other  eas ter n Eur opeans  who went wes t.  And onc e they s ettled in 
Paris , they lived in the poor es t s ection but they were tailor s.  My father was  a tailor.  My m other was  a 
hous ekeeper
.  
 
My c ous in and her  family  als o lived very c los e by.  They wer e the net wor th of my fam ily.  But I 
do not r emember  a thing about thos e days .  And the r eas on I know this  bec aus e m y c ous in is  still alive 
in Par is  and s he wrote me a letter and s he told me, you know
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  She filled you in.
 
> > J acques Fein:  Six year s  older than I.
 
>>
 
Bill Bens on:  So enough to fill you in on s om e details .  
 
 
Do you know if you had other r elatives  in Paris or do you know if you had a large, extended 
fam ily bac k  in Poland?  Do you know any of that?
 
> > J acques Fein:  As  far as  Poland, I'm s ure we had but
 
I have no idea who they were.  As  far as  Par is, 
we had s ome c ous ins .  The ans wer  is  yes  but, again, I have no idea who they wer e.  The only one who 
is  alive is  my s is ter  who is  two years  younger  than I.  She was  born in 1940.  And my c ous in and her 
br othe
r .  Survived the war in hiding als o.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Do you have any s ens e from what you've lear ned what Paris  was  like for imm igr ant 

Polis h J ews  who moved to Par is ?  Any s ens e of that?
 
> > J acques Fein:  Well, bas ic ally onc e the war
 
--
 
onc e Germ any invaded Fr anc e and Par is
 
--
 
you know, 
Paris  was  ground zero for  the J ews  in Fr anc e.  Mos t of the J ews  wer e in Paris .  And the for eign m ale 

J ews  wer e fir st taken.  My father was  taken in 1941 or s o to a tr ans it c amp c alled Pithiv iers  and 
deported to Aus chwitz.  They wer e deported back
 
--
 
they left Poland to Par is  and then back in trains  
wher e he was  eventually  m urder ed in Aus c hwitz.  And my mother  the s ame thing.  She was  a 
hous ekeeper
, in the poor s ec tion.  She was  eventually taken in a r oundup, J une
 
16, 1944
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Before we turn to that, you wer e telling us  what you learned about your  father.  Do you 

know anything about the c ir c um stanc es at all under  which he was  taken by the Germ ans ? 
 
> > J acques Fein:  From  what I read, from what I under s tand, the 
for eign male J ews  wer e the first 

taken.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Foreign m ale J ews .  Becaus e he's  fr om Poland.  Ok. 
 
> > J acques Fein:  Right.  And J ews  had to r egister .  That was  ac c ording to the Germ an polic e.  They 

had to r egis ter J ews .  And probably m ost of the
 
foreign J ews  lived in the poores t s ection of Paris so 
they knew wher e to go. 
 
 
In a s ens e, m y par ents , pr obably m y mother  m ostly, played hide and s eek  with my s is ter and I 
to make s ur e we were not taken.  But that's all I know about m y father.
 
> > Bill B en
s on:  You do know that he went to Pithiv iers .  Tell us  what that was . What do you know 
about Pithivier s ?
 

4 
 
> > Jacques Fein:  It's  in the s outhern part of Paris.  It was  us ually for  m ales .  Onc e you wer e in 
Pithiv ier s , the next s top was  Aus c hwitz.
 
> > B ill B e
ns on:  So it was  what they c alled a trans it c am p.  Right?  So it's  the next s top, as you s ay, to 
Aus c hwitz.
 
> > J acques Fein:  Yes .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Do you know m uc h els e about it? 
 
> > Jacques Fein:  Not too m uc h.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You don't know how long he
 
was  there? 
 
> > Jacques Fein:  Maybe a year .  Maybe les s  than a year .  Ther e wer e two differ ent c amps .  The one 
thing about Pithivier s
 
--
 
m y c ous in's father als o went to Pithivier s .  I talk  with her oc c as ionally.  Ever y 
year  for the las t 50 or  60 year s  they had a, quote, s or t of a reunion at Pithivier s  where the J ews  who 
s till live in Franc e, m os tly the c hildren of thos e who were deported and killed, they have a reunion at 
Pithiv ier s .  They go onc e a year by bus es to rem em ber what happened.
 
> > Bill Bens on: 
 
In the photogr aph we s aw earlier  with your father, fr om Pithivier s , how did you get that 
photogr aph?
 
> > J acques Fein:  I think  I got it from my c ous in.  As  far  as that s hot
 
--
 
well, las t s pring, J udee and I 
went to Paris.  We tried to find s ome information about Pithiviers .  What we wer e told, that they tried to 

m ake Pithiviers  look like a nic e plac e.  So the pic tures  look  kind of innoc ent.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Right.
 
> > J acques Fein:  But the r eality was  m uc h, m uch wors e than the pic tur e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Fr om  what you know, s om etime after  your  father was  taken and befor e your  mother  
was  c aught in a Germ an r oundup, your  mother ar ranged for you and your sis ter
 
to be hidden with a 
Fr ench Catholic  fam ily.  Before you tell us  about your  time with the family, what do you know about the 
r oundup that took  your mother and wher e s he was  taken?
 
> > J acques Fein:  That was  one of the or ders of the Fr enc h polic e and the Ger man polic e.  There were 

other r oundups but the m ajor  one was  June
 
16, 19
 
--
 
sorr y, July
 
16, 1942.  Tha
t's  when they took 
women and c hildr en becaus e a lot of the m ales  alr eady had been taken.  So then the r oundup was  take 

ever ybody and s end them to a terr ible, ter rible plac e where people lived in horrible c onditions .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Dr anc y?
 
> > J acques Fein
:  Of Paris .  It's another trans it c am p.  There were a few other s  but Dr anc y was  one of 
the m ain ones in Paris.  Again, a lot of the J ews  of Fr anc e lived in Paris .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  I think you lear ned that your  mother  m ay have been s eized while s he was  on 
the train?
 
> > J acques Fein:  That's what we unders tand. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Ok . 
 
> > J acques Fein:  A number  of year s  ago, 1986, I think , J udee and I vis ited a family.  The s is ter s at that 

tim e, they wer e teenagers, m aybe even younger.  They remem ber ed from  70 year s  ago what had 
happened.  So that's  what they told us.  Ther e's no way of m e pr oving it.  But it's  definitely pos s ible 
bec aus e you had to wear  the J ewis h s tar.  You had to do this .  And J ewish people panicked when they 

s aw Ger man or Fr enc h polic e.  And that's what I unders tand happened.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And as you were telling us , J uly of 1942 was  partic ular ly pr ofound in the number of 
r oundups .  And while you don't think your  m other was  c aught dur ing a partic ular ly infamous , m ajor  
r oundup in J ews  known as  the Velodrome, conduc ted J uly
 
1942, tell us about that roundup bec ause it 
was  s o m as s ive.
 
> > J acques Fein:  Again, this  was  another edic t by the German and French to get m ore J ews  out and 
deal with the final s olution of J ewis h people in Franc e and to s end to Aus chwitz.  They just r ounded up.  

Ac c ording to m y c ous in who remembers , the Frenc h polic e went from apar tment to apartment.  They 
knew wher e J ewis h people lived.  You had a few m inutes  to pack  a few things , into tr ucks, into

day per iod I think  s om e 13,000 wom en, c hildr en
 
--
 
> > J acques Fein:  I don't r em em ber
 
--
 
it's  in that range.  And they were horr ible c onditions  there also.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And that's  been the s ubjec t of actually I think  books and movies , has n't it?
 
> > Jacques Fein:  Right.  Ther e was  a book of Paris  that was  the c entral them e of the roundup.

> > Bill Bens on:  Can you tell us anything m ore about Dranc y, whic h is  wher e your  m om went?
 
> > Jacques Fein:  Ac tually, I went there onc e a num ber of years ago.  The only thing I really know is  
what I r ead about it.  Ever ything I read was  a horrible, horr ible c ondition.  And ther e were tr ans it trains  
going from  ther e to Aus chwitz.  I don't k now how m any but there were altogether over  80 tr ains that left
 
Fr ance.  And ther e wer e quite a number that left Drancy.  And when they went by tr ain, t
hey didn't go 
fir s t c las s.  They wer e pac ked
 
in
 
c attle c ar s
, i
n horrible c onditions
, i
n heat.  And people wer e s ick, as 
you c an im agine.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Have you been
 
able to lear n when both either your  m other, father, when they wer e 
taken to Ausc hwitz?  And wer e you able to learn the dates  that they were killed?
 
> > Jacques Fein:  Yes .  My father  was  tak en from  Pithivier s  to Aus c hwitz  in the thir d c onvoy in J une of 
194
1.  And m y mother was  towards  the end, last c onvoys , in 52, I think  c onvoy 52 I think.  That's  

bas ic ally
 
--
 
the bas ic  things that I've lear ned from doc um ents .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Right.
 
> > J acques Fein:  It was  by a ver y famous Nazi hunter.  He lis ted all the
 
convoys  that left Fr anc e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  By numbers .  So you wer e able to know that.
 
> > J acques Fein:  One reas on he was  able to do that is  bec aus e the Germans  were very effic ient with 
the Fr enc h polic e and they marked c onvoy one, who was  ther e, c onvoy two, wher e they wer e fr om  and 
what c ity they were bor n in. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You and your s is ter  Annette wer e hidden with a French fam ily, the Boc ahuts, 
whom  
you r em ained with until the end of the war.  Tell us  what you can about the Boc ahuts, if you know 
anything
,  
about how it was  arranged for them to be the ones  with whom  you were hidden.
 
> > J acques Fein:  So how
 
--
 
what was  the arr angem ent?  In Franc e ther e was  a J ewis h or ganization, 
Oeuvr es  de Secour s aux Enfants .  It m eans  the organization to s ave c hil
dren.  Their  m ain m is s ion was 
to s ave as many Jewis h kids as  poss ible
 a
nd put them in s afe plac es.  It was mos tly for s aving J ewish 
kids.  And they als o s aved kids  fr om  Germany and Aus tria when they wer e s ent to Fr anc e.
  
I'm pretty 
s ur e it was a c ooper ation of OSE and m y m other who did this .
 
 
At the s ame tim e, when we wer e in Franc e this  pas t s pring, we lear ned that the OSE, onc e 
the war started, went ar ound the different neighbor hoods  warning people what was  happening, that we 

need to s ave kids .  So they wer e kind of the network, the s oc ial s ervic e network .  How it happened, I 
have no idea.  How they found that plac e, I have abs olutely no idea.  But they did s ave quite a number  
of kids.  Unfortunately, although they s aved hundreds  of c hildren, m any, many mo
re thous ands wer e 
not s aved. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Tell us what you c an about the Boc ahut fam ily. Who wer e they? 
 
> > J acques Fein:  From  what I know they were a Fr enc h Catholic  family.  I don't remember too m uch of 
them.  I don't r emember being in fear.  Bas i
c ally I did what I was  told. When my parents took  me here, 
OSE told m e to go with them, we went.  We didn't have any other c hoic e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Right. 
 
> > J acques Fein:  Dur ing that time, I'm  pretty sure I had no idea what was  happening in the world. 
 
To 
m e, that was m y norm al life. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Right.
 
> > J acques Fein:  So it was  pleasant.  There was  no real fear but, again, we had to be ver y c areful, 

they had to be ver y c areful, that nobody betr ayed us . 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  One of the things  I was  str uck  by when you first told m e about what you went thr ough 

was  that even though you don't r em ember it s pecific ally, you rem em ber
 
--
 
you r ec all an atm os phere of 
always  hav ing to be quiet.
 
> > J acques Fein:  Yes .  Mm
-
hm m.  That's  the nature als o of a lot of c hildren who wer e hidden bec ause 
that was  im portant.  You didn't want anybody to k now who you were and what was  happening.  Kids

> > Bill Bens on:  I think mos t 
of us pr obably feel that that's  r eally pr etty pr ofound that you r ec all that 
atmos pher e, being quiet. What a thing for a ver y young c hild.
 
> > J acques Fein:  Yeah.  That I do.

> > Bill Bens on:  You also have c om e to believe or have been told, perhaps , that 
your  mother
 
--
 
before 
s he was  taken by the Ger m ans, s he may have been able to vis it from tim e to time while you were in 
hiding.  Is  that your  under s tanding?
 
> > Jacques Fein:  That's m y unders tanding fr om vis iting that family a number of years  ago.  I als o 
kind 
of remem ber that.  I r emember being
 
--
 
one tim e being kind of s ad.  And when I vis ited that fam ily , the 
fos ter  fam ily in 1984, I think , or 
`
86, they told me what had happened
, t
hat onc e I was  told that m y 
m other  was  no longer here, I bec ame very quiet, s ad.  So that kind of ver ified what I had felt.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And, of c our s e, Annette, your s ister, was  just an infant.
 
> > Jacques Fein:  Pr obably r em em ber s  m uc h les s .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Do you have any s ens e of how the Boc ahuts may have tried to explain the pr es enc e of 
you, a little boy, and an infant girl?
 

> > J acques Fein:  They had to be very c areful.  I have no idea.  They had other kids .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  They did have other kids ?
 
> > J acques Fein:  Other  kids.  Again, Paris was  ground zer o.  They were on a farm .  It was  in the 
c ountr y.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Information in the c ountr y.  Ok .
 
> > J acques Fein:  In a different atmos pher e with res pec t to Jewis h people and the war , per  s e.  But I'm 
s ur e they had to go through all the other things of war time.  But
 
it was n't lik e c ontinuous ly patrolled by 
the Fr enc h polic e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Like it would have been in downtown Paris .
 
> > J acques Fein:  Yeah.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You also have c om e to believe or know that you were baptized as  Catholic s .
 
> > J acques Fein:  T
hat's what I understand.  Yeah. 
 
> > Bill Bens on: Whic h was  part of the
 
--
 
I as s ume part of what they had
 
--
 
> > J acques Fein:  Their way of keeping m e s afe. 
 

> > Bill Bens on:  You mentioned that you've been bac k  to Par is and Franc e a few times .  I think it was  in 
1983 that you wer e able to vis it with the Boc ahut fam ily.  Fr om  that vis it, what were you able to learn 
about your  tim e with them
, w
hat life was  like for you and Annette while you wer e hidden with them?
 
> > J acques Fein:  When we v is ited with them, it was  ver y s tr ange.  Onc e I left their plac e in 1945, I 
r eally had no c ontac t with them  until 1983.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Almos t 40 years . 
 
> > J acques Fein:  It was  nec es s ar y for  us to br eak  any emotional ties  to that fam ily bec aus e there wer e 
s o m any other
 
--
 
it was n't an eas y time dur ing thos e year s .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Right.
 
> > J acques Fein:  Going to an or phanage.
 

 
When we vis ited them, I s poke with them.  They told m e that they wer e just talking about my 
s is ter and I r ecently, whic h was  unbelievable but it could happen.  All I k now is  they did take c are of 

s om e other c hildren.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  They did take c ar e of other c hildren?
 
> > J acques Fein:  I'm pretty s ure.  And they had four , five kids  of their own.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And hid other J ewis h c hildr en?
 

>> 
J acques Fein:  Could be.  I have absolutely no r eal pr oof.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And, of c our s e, am ong the things
 
--
 
> > J acques Fein:  Bec aus e the way I r emem ber
 
--
 
one of the s ister s phr ased it that we r em ember 
you're the only one who has  c ome back , im plying ther e wer e s ome others. 
 
> > Bill B ens on:  Right.  Right.
 

 
Of c ours e, over  that period of thos e year s  that you were there with the Boc ahuts , ther e's  s o 
m any things  that would obvious ly have not been nor m al when you'r e hidden like that.  And one of them 

would
 
pr obably have been getting medic al c are.  And one of your few m em ories  is an inc ident where I 
think  you have an ear infec tion.
 
> > Jacques Fein:  Right.  Again, one of my things, I was  in hiding.
 

7 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Right.
 
> > Jacques Fein:  Evidently one tim e
 
I had an ear ac he.  That I rem em ber.  I went to a hos pital in Paris .  
And the father of the family
 
--
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Mr .
 
Bocahut.
 
> > Jacques Fein:  Went to the hos pital, m aybe a day or two days  later, took  me out. When I vis ited the 
family a number  of year s ago, they told m e that the day or  two after I was  taken out, the Ger mans had 

invaded that hos pital.  So ver y likely had I been ther e, I would have
 
--
 
I would not be her e.  So, again, 
the over all them e
 
--
 
I like to tell people we played hide and s eek  exc ept it was  for real s tuff.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Abs olutely.
 
 
So again, knowing that there's s o little that you don't know about that tim e, it was  a s ubstantial 
per iod of time but you do remember a day late in the war, 1944, when Allied Forc es c ame through yo
ur 

village where you were with the Boc ahuts.  What do 
you 
r ec all about that?
 
> > J acques Fein:  Well, it was  s om etimes
 
--
 
well, D
-
Day J une
 
6, 1944.  Par is  was  liber ated August
 
24
,  
I 
think  1944.  So the town people wer e on the highway, I think , s ome type of m ain r oad.  Bas ic ally it felt 
like
 
--
 
an example, it felt like the Four th of J uly c elebr ation. We s aw tank s , s oldiers .  They wer e 
thr owing c andy.  There were flags.  People wer e c heering.  I had no idea why they wer e c heer ing at 

that time.  But I do r emem
ber that day, a ver y happy day for the town people, for Franc e, and obviously 
for the whole world.  That was  definitely the beginning of the end ofWor ld War II.
 
> > Bill B ens on:  Do 
you 
rec all any fighting that took  plac e?
 
> > J acques Fein:  No.  No m emories of that.  As oppos ed to in Germany there was  lots  of fighting.  In 

Poland ther e was  lots .  In Hungar y and other s.  But in Fr anc e only in Par is.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And with the liberation, of c ours e, the war
 
--
 
in August
 
1944, the war  would c ontinue 
els ewhe
r e until May
 
1945
 f
or muc h longer.
 
 
Following the end of the war , in May
 
1945, J acques , OSE, the Fr enc h organization that plac ed 
you in hiding, r emoved you fr om the home of the Boc ahuts  and took  you to an orphanage and then 
later moved you to another where
 
you and Annette would r em ain until 1948.  What
 
do you k
now about 
the c irc um stanc es
 t
hat led OSE to c om e and get you fr om the Boc ahuts  and then move you to thes e 
or phanages ?
 

> > J acques Fein:  Their m is s ion during the war was  to s ave kids  and put them  in hiding, whic h they did.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And as you s aid, pr obably hundreds  of kids .
 

> > J acques Fein:  But after the war  their  m is s ion was  to take them out of hiding and tr y to reunit
e 
them  
with their fam ilies .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Right.
 
> > J acques Fein:  So whatever  means , the OSE knew that m y parents  were no longer alive.  And the 
family that I had, unc les , c ould not take c ar e of my s is ter  and I bec aus e one of them s ur vived 
Aus c hwitz
.  A
nd I'm not quite s ure about the other fam il
y but they just c ould not do it.  So we were put 
in orphanages , one, Br ittany, from  
`
45 to late 
`
46
a
nd the other  one from 
`
47 to 
`
48, Taverny.
 
 
The
 
key thing about the or phanages  
--
 
people typic ally think or phanages ar e a terr ible plac e, 
whic h c ould be,
 
but for  us  it was  exac tly the oppos ite.  We c am e out of hiding. We played with other  
kids.  We learned about our r eligion.  And we definitely were fed.  You know, we had friends .  The only 

thing was  m ost of us knew that our parents were no longer
 
--
 
ther e wer e som e
 
wher e either not alive or 
s om e wer e or phans , had family plac es , but.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Do you have any r ec ollec tion of what it was  like when OSE c ame and got you and took 
you fr om the home of the Boc ahuts ?
 
> > J acques Fein:  No.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And the fir s t plac e you went to for a s hor t per iod of tim e was  near Normandy, I believe.
 
> > J acques Fein:  Ac tually c los e.  I made a m istake.  It was  in Brittany.  On the West Coast.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And you weren't ther e ver y long.  Do you remember ver y m uc h about the first place 

you went to? 
 
> > J acques Fein:  It was  a plac e, a nic e plac e to be.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  That's  your  r ec ollec tion
; 
it was  a nic e plac e to be.

> > Jacques Fein:  We were with other kids.  I don't think we s t
ayed there that long.  Taverny 
I 
r em em ber mor e bec ause I rem ember going to s chool and having friends and lear ning about being 
J ewis h all over  again.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And you s tayed ther e at Taverny until 1948.
 

> > J acques Fein:  Right.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  You did des c ribe that as  happy tim es .  Thos e were happy tim es.  Tell us even m ore 
about that.  As  you s aid, fir s t you had c ome out of hiding, you wer e taken to a plac e wher e ther e was  
lots  of other kids  and you'r e free to play and do all the things kids  do, started s c hool. What else do you 
r em em ber about that?
 
>> J
acques Fein:  The main thing was  being with other c hildr en and definitely learning about the J ewis h 
r eligion.  You k now, the Shabbats  s er vic es .  And that was  it.  And going to s c hool, walking to school.  
That 
was  always  great.  And lear ning.  L
earning Fr en
ch 
--
 
learning in the Frenc h sc hool and learning in 
the Hebrew s c hool.
 
 
I m entioned this pas t s pring we went to Fr anc e.  Judee and I actually vis ited Taverny.  We 
went to the orphanage whic h is  a home now for troubled kids.  But I kind of r em ember the main
 
hous e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  It's now a hom e for  tr oubled kids?
 
> > J acques Fein:  Yeah.  Completely differ ent.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Did it look  like your  m em ories?
 
> > J acques Fein:  Not exac tly.  But it was  a big tr ee that I r em ember
 
--
 
as  I told J udee
 
--
 
that was
 
s till 
ther e, a hum ungous , big tr ee.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Did OSE have a for mal role with thes e homes ?
 
> > J acques Fein:  Oh, yeah.  I'm s orr y.  They wer e OSE homes .  They had a bunc h of other hom es .  

And the OSE s till oper ates  a few of thes e plac es in Franc e.
 

> > Bill Bens on:  To this  day.
 
> > J acques Fein:  It's  m ore like a s oc ial s er vic e agenc y right now.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  It was  Pos twar  Franc e when you wer e at Taver ny.  Do you rec all what c onditions were 
like gener ally?  There was  s c ar c ity.  The war  is  over.
 
>>
 
J acques Fein:  That's a good ques tion.  But as far  as me s peaking, we wer e taken c ar e of in the 
or phanage. We were too young to deal with anything els e.
 

> > Bill Bens on:  So the outs ide wor ld you didn't k now about at that point.
 
> > J acques Fein:  Yeah.  I
f we did, it was  really in learning but I don't rec all being
m
esmerized as  to 
what had happened
 a
nd the c onditions of Fr anc e and the r est of the wor ld.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  The r est of Europe.
 
 
Of c ours e, OSE, where they c ould, hoped to r eunite the c hildr en wi
th their parents and that 
was n't to be for you.  Do you know when you really, tr uly under stood that your par ents would not 

r eturn? 
 
> > J acques Fein:  Good question.  Truthfully speaking, I don't rem em ber .  But I m ust have known in the 

or phanage s om ehow.  Bec aus e eventually I was told I was  being adopted and the whole proc es s .  I 

m us t have known s om ehow.  But I don't r em ember  how
, w
ho, wher e, how I felt, the exac t wording. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And, of c our s e, you wer e adopted by an Amer ic an fam ily
, t
he Feins .  How did they 
c om e to find you and your s ister ? 
 
> > J acques Fein:  Well, unfortunately they're deceas ed.  I never really as k ed them  that question, why 

they went up to the or phanage.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  In Taver ny.
 
> > J acques Fein:  But what I knew, they were v
er y well c onnec ted to the Jewis h c omm unity wher e they 
lived in New J er s ey.  So they wer e c onnec ted to that Jewis h c ommunity in New York .  They c ouldn't 
have any c hildren.  They knew how to deal with trying to adopt kids .  Somehow they wound up in this  
or ph
anage.  So they knew the s ys tem but exac tly  why they went to that par ticular  plac e was  a m atter  of 
c hance.

they wer e s taying I think m aybe in Par is

r st of all, I don't think  I had a c hoic e

I don't think  I had a r eal c hoic e in being 
adopted.  As I m entioned befor e, I went with the pr ogr am
.  W
hen I was  with my par ents, went into 
hiding, went to the orphanage, whatever .  So the m ain thing was  we went with the program.  We 

r ealized we had to adjust to a new life, a new family, new c ous ins , new language obvious ly, new c ultur e
 
a

bes ides  the culture, obvious ly s peaking Englis h was  very im portant, going to 

s c hool.  When I c am e to the United States , I actually s tarted in pr ivate s c hool.  I went into the fir s t gr ade 
when I was  10 years  old.  I was  able to

to

do.  That was  eas y 
to deal with in private s chool.  Am er icanized in term s of being J ewis h, going to the synagogue,
 
Hebr ew

or phanage from  OSE.  Tell us  what ar e the things you've

One of the things I was  am azed by 
was  when you told m e the extens ive amount of doc umentation that you've been able to find.

OSE

ac tually, I was  able to get inform ation about m y life from them.
  
Som e of the doc um ents  that you

her e m y father  and m other wer e tak en.  
J us t ver ifies what it happened to me.  I got stuff that I was  vac c inated, went to s c hool.

She had wr itten m e a letter.  As  you mentioned, in 1983, there 
was  a gather ing of Am er ic an

J ewis h Holoc aus t s urvivors  in Was hington, D.C.  I went with a fr iend of

What was  it like, 
J acques , for you to go to your firs t meeting of child s urvivors ?

s ay Holoc aus t s ur vivor, they'll think of c onc entr ation cam ps  whic h would have been hor rendous
.  Had I 
been s ent to a c onc entr ation c am p, I would have been 3 or  4, 5, and would have been killed 

imm ediately.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Imm ediately.
 
> > Jacques Fein:  Young people had no c hanc e and older ones.  So it was  a way of s aying, hey, ther e 

were other  s u

--
 
who wer e young during the war  and they s uffered as 
m uc h
 
--
 
well, in differ ent ways  than those who were in c onc entration camps .  So that was  one of the 
foc us , to be able to s ay that we'r e s ur vivors  and we had a voic e.
 
 
And as  you know, the oldes t s ur vivors , thos e that wer e in the c onc entration c am ps , are in their 
80s  and 90s and are obvious ly dying off.  The younger ones, like
 
Firs t Per son
 
people that have been 
s peaking the past two years , ar e mos tly younger s ur vivors .  Ver y few of the older ones ar e able to talk 
bec aus e of health and other c onditions.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And as a r es ult of that exper ienc e, you've ac tually then helped c reate and found an 

organization.
 
> > J acques Fein:  It was  nec es s ar y.  Right. We went there.  And then
 
there wer e other people who 
were like me, like us . We for med a few groups  in the Was hington ar ea.  Now we have maybe a 
federation of a whole bunc h of gr oups in the United States , in Eur ope.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  J acques, I think  befor e we c los e the program in
 
a bit, we have tim e for s om e questions  
fr om  our  audienc e.  Why don't we turn to our audienc e.
 

 
We're going to ask  that if you have a ques tion, and we hope you do, we're going to hand a mic  
to you.  We have folks on either s ide of the ais le with m ic s.  Wait until you get the m ic in your hand.  Try 

to make the ques tion as  br ief as you c an.  I'll probably repeat the question jus t to m ake s ure ever ybody, 
inc luding J acques, hears the ques tion befor e he res ponds  to you.
 

 
So if anybody has  a ques tion, pleas e r aise your  hand s o we s pot you and give you a mic.  If 
not, I'll ask a c ouple more. 
 
 
We have one r ight her e.  Ok.  There we go.  Thank  you.

When you were with the Catholic  family, do you r ec all playing with any other kids  beyond that 
Catholic  family?  Do 
you remember feeling hungr y at all, anything like that? 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  The ques tion is  when you wer e with the Boc ahut family, do rec all playing with any 

other c hildr en outs ide of the family.
 
> > J acques Fein:  And feeling hungr y and all of that.  Let me ans wer  the sec ond part.  I never felt any 
danger  of feeling fear  or feeling hungr y or even probably then even s c ar ed from that point of view.  
Maybe I was  plain too young to understand.
 
 
As  far  as the kids , I know I had played with them.  I jus t don't r emember  exac tly what we 
played.  It was  on the farm.  I r em ember  r iding a hors e onc e I think .  So it's  ver y, ver y vague.  But the

they enc our aged you to do or would they prefer not to talk  about that pas t you had? 
 
> > Bill Bens on: When you were with your adopted fam ily, did
 
they enc our age talking about what you 
had been thr ough in the pas t or not? 
 
> > J acques Fein:  We didn't talk too muc h about the pas t.  We talked about the future.  But I just don't 

r em em ber talking too muc h as  to what had happened.
  
They did try to connect m e with m y r elatives  in it 
Fr ance, whic h was  very, ver y diffic ult.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  They did?  Ok. 
 
> > J acques Fein:  They tr ied to do that.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Thank  you.  We have a question right down her e.  Yes .  The m ic will be right with y ou.  

Right 
her e in the next row.  Thank  you.

You s aid that your dad s ur vived in Aus c hwitz for  a year .  How long did your m other  s urvive there? 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Ask ed how long your father and your m other s ur vived at Aus c hwitz befor e they wer e 
killed. 
 
> > J acques F
ein:  Ahh.  I'm pr etty s ure it was  not too long.  I think  m y father  was  killed on the way or in 

Aus c hwitz and m y m other was  s ent towar ds  the end of the war .  And fr om the doc um ents  that I have, 
s he was  killed immediately.
 
 
Mos t J ews  who wer e s ent to Aus c hwitz were either  s ent to forc ed labor or to the gas  
c ham ber s.  To be s ent to labor , you had to be s trong, str ong enough to wor k , for the Germans .  

Otherwise

.  Thank  

you, Mitc h.  J ulian?  Yeah. 
 
>> 
I have two questions .  One, do you know whether  the Boc ahuts  wer e paid anything for taking c ar e of 
you, for helping you?  And num ber  two, have you been back to Poland?  Have you tried to tr ac e your  

fam ily bac k  to Po
land?
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Do you know if the Boc ahuts were paid anything to c ar e for you?  And, two, have you 
been back to Poland to learn about your  fam ily there. 
 
> > J acques Fein:  The firs t one the ans wer is  I believe they were paid.  There was  m oney involved.  
How muc h, wher e, how, I have no idea.  When I vis ited the OSE offic es , that's what they m entioned.  
But the main thing is  they had to be a safe plac e.  People get paid, they c ould be s c oundrels .
 
 
Going back , I was  born in Paris .  I never was  in Poland.  But last s pr ing my wife and I had a 
s hor t 30
-
day trip to Is rael and then to Poland.  The pur pos e of going to Poland was  to try to vis it the 
towns  wher e m y par ents wer e bor n.  So we did s ee the towns .  But they were nothing like what they 
were.  Tried t o get m ore information about them.  It was  a nec ess ary thing to do, just to go ther e and 
s ee the towns.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Have you been able to c onnec t with dis tant relatives  in Poland?
 

> > J acques Fein:  No.
 
> > Bill B ens on:  No.
 
> > J acques Fein:  The other  
thing

I did go to, a group of us, we went to the Aus c hwitz
-
Bir kenau 
c onc entration c am p.  That was  quite a moving plac e to vis it. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  
Adam? 
 
>> 
Sinc e you bec am e rec onnec ted with J udaism
, 
what has  been its s ignific anc e to you? 
 
> > Bill B ens o
n:  The s ignific anc e of being r ec onnec ted to Judais m  for  you.
 
> > J acques Fein:  As  far as  a rec onnection, I never  knew I was  disconnec ted exc ept I knew that I had 

been baptized.  I didn't really have in a knowledge.  I was  too young to realize that I had b
een 
dis c onnec ted, s o to s peak .  But as  far as being J ewis h, I r ealize that I'm Jewis h and learned about 
being Jewis h.  When I went to Par is  las t s pring, we had no pr oblem s going to J ewis h plac es  and 
vis iting Franc e even though there wer e s om e differ ent levels  of anti
-
S em itis m  in the P ar is  r egion.  No 
pr oblem .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Thank  you.  We have one here, blue.  And then one down here
, i
n blue, too, I think.

When you were in hiding with the Bocahuts , do rem em ber  where you slept?  Did you have a hidden 
ro
om ? 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Did you have a hidden r oom  with the Boc ahuts or do you r emember wher e you s lept?
 
> > J acques Fein:  I don't think it was  hidden at all.  It was  a farm .  It was n't like Anne Fr ank  wher e she 
hid in the apartm ent building, in Ams terdam, in the big c ity.  It was  an open far m.  I'm pretty s ure I didn't 
s leep or s tay in a hidden plac e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  As you said ear lier, they had you baptized.  So the appearanc e that you're family 
s om ehow or  not J ewis h c er tainly. 
 
 
We have o
ne r ight her e I 
think.  Y
up.  Karla, thank  you. 
 
>> 
In the Boc ahut family, wer e you ac ting as daughter and s on? 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  One mor e tim e.  Thank  you.
 
>> 
No wor r ies .  You went to live with the Boc ahuts .  Were you acting as their daughter  and s on?  They 
had additional c hildren.  How did they explain your pres enc e? 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  How
 
--
 
with other  c hildren, do you know how they explained your pres enc e, yours  and 
A
nnette's ?
 
> > Jacques Fein:  That's a gr eat ques tion but no idea.  Again, when I vis ited the fam ily year s
 
ago, the 
par ents had already been dec eas ed.  I s poke to the c hildren who wer e in their 70s  or  80s .  They s aid 
they just tr eated
 
--
 
we wer e par t of the family, whatever  that meant. 
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Ok .  I think  the time for a c ouple m or e. 
 
> > J acques Fein:  Again, 
it™s  the 
m ain thing
 
--
 
jus t to realize I was  ver y young at that time.  In hiding, I 
was  3 years  old, 4, 5, 6.  The idea was  not to r eally advertis e who I was  and what I was  doing.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Right.  Go ahead.
 
>> 
I have great respec t for  the
 
journey you've tak en to find out s o m uc h about your  past.  I wonder, has 
this  yearning always  been with you or  does it occur at s om e point, you know, in your life later on? 
 
> > J acques Fein:  Well, the jour ney s tarted definitely in the early 1980s  when we
 
went to that gathering.  
But pr ior to that, even in the 
`
70s , when I was  30, 40 years  old or so, a friend of mine who had 
the 
s am e s ituation, we alway s  wondered what had happened.  And then to c ontinue the jour ney, we form ed 
thes e gr oups  and we met other people in the s ame s ituation.  Everybody felt the s ame way.  You k now, 

what had happened, who we wer e, and what happened s inc e we cam e to the United States .
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Thank  you.  We have a c ouple in the back .  J ulian, I think there was  a hand up tha
t 
way. 
 
 
All r ight.  I was  going to as k  you, J acques , for Annette, s he firs t c ame to the United States with 
you but eventually s he went to live in Is r ael.  How have c ir c ums tanc es been for her? 
 
> > J acques Fein:  Well, s he went to s tudy in Is rael in 1962, I
 
think, after  gr aduating fr om c ollege.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  So s he's in her ear ly 20s  at that tim e.
 
> > J acques Fein:  Right.  My parents s upported her .  Then s he never c ame back.  I think
 
--
 
s he never  
m arried.  She has no fam ily.  I got a feeling s he didn't r ealize s he was  r eally a s ur vivor until m aybe 15, 

20 year s  ago.  She kind of c onnected to her pas t.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  And you helped m ak e that happen.
 
> > J acques Fein:  There was  that one c onferenc e but with a gr oup we form ed, the Feder ation of 
Su
r vivor s , we 
had c onferenc es  for  the las t 27, 28 year s .  Annette went to one or two of them .  So that 
helped her .  Als o, life in Is rael, being J ewis h in Is rael, is  c ompletely differ ent than being J ewis h in the 

United States .  There are m or e s ur vivors  and mor e J ewis h s t
uff.
 
> > Bill Bens on: We'r e going to c los e our pr ogr am  in a m oment.  I'm going to turn back  to J acques  to do 

that.  I want to, first, thank  all of you for being with us  today for our
 
First Per s on
 
progr am. We have 
pr ogram s  eac h Wednesday and Thur s day for the next two weeks .  I don't expec t you to c om e back  in 
the next two weeks  but you'r e welc ome to.  But we will r es um e again in Mar c h of next year  for  2016.  
So I hope that if you live loc ally, you c an c ome to a
 
Firs t Pers on
 
pr ogr am  or if you don't live loc ally, 
c om e back and vis it.  Ther e's other things  to s ee as  well.  Put us on your  itinerary.
 
 
It's  our  tr adition at
 
First Per s on
 
that our
 
First P er son
 
has  the last word.  J ac ques is  going to 
have the las t wor d.  J us t two other  points . When J ac ques  finis hes, he's going to stay here on the 

13
 
 
s tage.  So if anybody wants  to c ome up and s hak e his  hand or get your  pic ture taken with him, 
abs olutely feel fr ee to do that, pleas e.  And then the other  thing is  when J ac ques finis hes, our
 
photogr apher , J oel, is  going to c ome up on the stage and he's  going to tak e a pic tur e of J acques with 

you as  the backdrop.  It looks r eally nic e.  It's a nic e m emento for J acques.  So I'll ask  you to s tand at 
that point s o that you'r e in the back ground. 
 
 
On that note, I'm going to turn to J acques  for his  las t word. 
 
> > J acques Fein:  First I want to thank Bill Bens on for doing this .  He's  been doing this for  how many 

year s ?
 
> > Bill Bens on:  16. 
 
> > J acques Fein:  16 year s .  And s ever al tim es
 
--
 
s ever al weeks  dur ing the s umm er.  And als o the 
m
us eum for s pons oring this  pres entation whic h has  been ver y us eful and helpful for people, asking 
c om m ents.  They ar e ver y great.
 
 
The main thing I want to leave you in term s of the Holoc aus t and s urvivor s, you know, th
ey'r e 
all differ ent but they're all the s am e.  Although I never  was  in a c onc entration c amp or a ghetto, you 
know, I went through the Holoc aus t by hiding, whic h is  a differ ent form of survival, of dealing with 
s uffer ing.  Ther e ar e other s  like me.  That's  
the main thing I want to tell you.  Although we are all 
differ ent, we are bas ic ally
 
--
 
our  bas ic them e is all the s ame.  What happened before the war, how we 
s ur vived, and then what happened after the war . 
 
 
Thank  you for c oming her e.
 
> > Bill Bens on:  Thank  you, J acques .
