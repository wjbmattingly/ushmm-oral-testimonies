GEORGE PISIK 
July 14, 1993 
 
Beginn ing Tape One, Side A 
 
Answer: My name is 
George Pisik.
 I was born May 25
th
, 1925 in  
New Yo rk City
. I 
was going to  City College, 
Brooklyn 
College actually, in 
New York City 
when I 
enlisted in the army. Took the 
ASTP
 test, was accepted into 
engineering school in 
the army , but I had to perform 13 weeks of
 basic training and then  I was sent to 
Ca l 
Tech 
for engineering school. After the firs
t term was over, which was December, I 
guess of ™44, the Battle of the Bulge occurre
d. We were closed down and we were 
sent to 
Euro pe
 as replacements. I was in this 13
th
 armo red division, 16
th
 infantry 
battalion, assigned to half-tracks and tank
s. And after three major campaigns, the 
war was winding down. 
And May 1945 we ente
red the place called 
Da cha u
, right 
outside of 
Munich. 
We were never told about
 Dach au,
 we were never told about 
concen tration camps. We had no idea that we
 were getting into something like that. 
Question: Nothing in ﬁ
The Stars and Stripesﬂ 
or no briefings of any kind? 
A: Noth ing of any kind. We ha
d liberated some Canadian and 
U.S. 
Army or 
U.S.
 
Air Force prisoner of war camps previous to
 this and we thought this was another 
prisoner of war camp. And wh en th e troo
ps and th e tanks and our half-tracks 
entered 
Dachau
, we couldn™t believe what we saw. I was a kid, I really was a naïve 
kid and when I saw the bodies lying around, 
it Œ it really  got to me. Some were just 
thrown in the corner and so me were piled in
 blocks of five, five
 going one way, five

going another way, and Œ like cord wood. And 
they had tags attach
ed to their toes. 
We were there Œ as it was getting dark that
 evening, we were wandering around. We 
were warned, do not feed th
e prisoners, but we were hungry ourselves and we had 
K 
rations and 
C 
rations, which were almost indiges
tible to the soldiers. And these 
people were starving and we 
gave them frankfurters and 
beans and we almost killed 
them. We really did, their stomach couldn™t
 take it. Then a young lady came up to 
me, who I thought was in her 30™s. It 
turned out she was 
19, and th rough an 
interpreter Œ she kept pointing to a mezuzah
 that I was wearing around my neck, a 
little silver cylindergiven to
 me by my grandmother – 
[tape break] 
Œ young lady 
said that she was 19 years old and that 
the German guard s had ka Œ had kept her 
alive as she was a plaything for them. And they
 gave in Œ in return  they kept her out 
of the ovens and they  gave her food. She 
kept pointing to  the mezuzah and I took it 
off and I gave it to her and I showed her 
and with her hairpins
 he pulled the shi Œ 
my Œ I didn't even know th
ere was a paper in the mezuzah, it was a very small 
cylinder. She started to cry and said it wasthe first Hebrew that she had seen in 

years and years, because they had burnt 
everything. I took o
ff the mezuzah and I 
gave it to her. She started to cry and sh e 
grabbed me around the legs and she was 
hysterical and Œ anyway , we Œ th at wa
s the last I saw of her. The army Œ 
Q: Was she the only wo man or Œ

A: The only woman Œ 
Q: 
Œ
 wa Œ were there large numbers Œ  
A: Œ the only wo man I had spoken 
to, that I had any contact with. 
Q: Okay . 

A: And she took me by the arm and sh e took 
me for a re Œ very 
long walk, and there 
were ovens, and there were so
me bodies in the ovens. And 
I couldn™t believe it. I Œ I 
just Œ I mean, we weren™t prepared for this
. Then we were called, we had to mount 
up, get back  on our tanks and 
we would continue further on. 
Q: How long do you 
think you were there 
[indecipherable]
 
A: Oh, I was only th ere maybe four or five hours Œ 

Q: Four or five hours. 
A: Œ in
 Dach au
, we had to keep  going. I wrote my  mo ther that night to tell her 
mother to forgive me, 
but I gave away the mezuzah in a concen  Œ in a place called 
the concen tration camp. And I forgot about 
it, I mean it took 
several weeks for the 
letter to go over and it took several more 
weeks for an answer to come back. She 
told me that she had told a neighbor wh
at had occurred and th at neighbor told  
another neighbor and before I knew it I began to receive shoeboxes full of 
mezuzahs. I must have received 50
 to a hundred me
zuzahs from all over 
New York 
City. 
Wh at do you do with a hundred m
ezuzahs? We were now past the

concen tration camps and we Œ 
there was nobody to give them to. So I gave th em to 
the chaplains and they said
, some of them, they would distribute them. And now I 
still had a Œ a whole bunch of 
mezuzahs left. So I went to
 my southern soldiers, the 
people in my  comp any,
 who were mostly from 
Alabama
 and
 Mississippi
 and 
Georgia
 Œ not too bright, but th ey
 were very good soldie
rs. And I gave them the 
mezuzahs and I told them that these were 
good lu ck ch arms and that if they wore 
these mezu zahs when th Œ but
 they were not to put 
them on til they got home, 
because then they woul
d have endless erections. And they believed me. 
Q: They did, huh? 
A: All Jews are rich and all Jews 
are smart and I woul
dn™t lie to them. 
Q: Okay .  

A: And th-that™s how Œ 

Q: I bet those were their ve
ry prized possessi ons, then. 

A: And not only that, but I said, if you have
 Œ if you take more than one, you should 
put it on the door to the entrance to you
r house, it will bring you very good luck. 
And to Œ for all I know there is
 still in the backwoods of 
Mississippi 
and 
Georgia
 
and 
Alabama, 
there may be some mezuzahs up on the doorways.  
Q: Some good old Protestant boys th
at have mezuzahs on the doorw ays.

A: And I™m sure they did have endless erec
tions when  they did get home, and that™s 
my  story with 
Dach au
. 
[tape break]
 
Q: Œ had some wonderful de
tail about the road into 
Dach au
 and how it was towards 
the end of the war and they were moving so
 fast that the food drops couldn™t keep 
up with you and sta Œ mo to Œ mo to r oil was 
a priority, that Œ that you were without 
[indecipherable]
 
A: No Œ oh Œ wi Œ oh no, it Œ w-we were
 with the third army  and we were moving 
so rapidly that we had no time to have food
. We couldn™t Œ we were running out of 
food. 
Patton 
says find the food wherever you
 can get it in the countryside. 
Q: Don™t armored units? I mean, they always Œ 
A: Yes, armored units. 
Q: Œ prep are 
[indecipherable] 
thing Œ 
A: Either get off the road, or get out Œ 
anyway, airplanes were dropping supplies. 
The first thing th at they dropped was fuel
 for the tanks and ammunition. Then  they 
dropped medical supplies and by this time, wh
en we were supposed
 to get the food, 
we were running out of gas again, so they 
came back and they kept dropping diesel 
fuel or gasoline, whatever 
they burned. And we never di
d get th-the food that we 
needed, so we had to live off 
the countryside, which wasn™t
 very interesting. But we 
found food. We did find enough to 
keep goin g, and we went through 
Munich
 and

we passed the 
Munich 
stadium with a huge swastika 
up on th e Œ on the roof. And I 
remember that the company 
Œ well, the battalion commander 
had the tanks fire their 
tank guns and blow it away, wh ich was very 
exciting. And th at af
ternoon, late that 
afternoon we got into 
Dachau
. 
Q: Did you go through this town
 Dach au
, or did you approach  
[indecipherable]
 
A: No, I don™t rememb er th
at, I remember going through 
Munich
 and th at took 
awhile to get through 
Munich. 
And th en Œ I don™t rememb er the town of
 Da chau
 at 
all, all I rememb er is going th rough th e 
gates, the wooden gates that were busted 
open and going into  the camp itself. 
Q: Were there other American soldiers 
there before you, or were you all the 
[indecipherable]
 the first tanks? 
A: I Œ there mu st have been, coming Œ caus
e they were coming from all directions. 
Q: Several directions. 

A: And I do remember that another person 
Œ it™s coming back to me, gave me a cat 
of nine tai Œ no, this girl that I gave th
e mezuzah to gave me a Œ an object wrapped 
in a towel, which was about 
eight inches long, 
a wooden handle, it had nine leather 
thongs, and stuck in the leather thongs we
re carpet tacks. And they were beaten 
with these things and the flesh was ripped 
off and some of the tacks still had pieces 
of flesh on the tacks. And I had kept that 
for awhile, and then I just threw it away. I

Œ wh at the hell did I need it for? And th at was one of the souvenirs. We had a 
German flag, which I think I still have, and 
it was a very sad time in my life, an d ya 
Œ being 19 Œ 19 or 20 years ol
d at the time, it made a very strong impression on me. 
Q: Was there any sort 
of counseling offered Œ 
A: No. 

Q: Œ either the chaplains, was there any attempt Œ 

A: No. 
Q: Œ to deal with the fact that Œ 
A: None whatsoever. 

Q: Œ this was a very traumatic experience? 
A: We just kept going until we Œ they st
opped us, we were in
 a small town in 
Austria
 for a couple of weeks, an
d then they  Œ slowly they
 pulled us back to Œ the 
lucky Œ what we called the ci
garette camps, luck Œ Camp 
Lucky Strike, 
Camp
 Old 
Gold
, and from these camps, which were ri
ght near the harbor, we waited for the 
ship to come to take us to go to 
Japan.
 Ou r division was scheduled  to be the assault 
division on 
Honshu
 
Island
, the Japanese invasion. We got back to  the 
United 
States
, I spent that Œ oh, a week or so on th
e boat in the hospital for a leg injury. I 
was home on a recuperative leave and during 
the recuperative leave, they dropped 
the atomic bong Œ bomb  on 
Hiroshima.
 That was the end of the war, and 
Ha rry

Truman 
saved my  life. I did not have to go to 
Japan
, and according to the army 
officers when we did get to 
California
, the life expectancy  of our division was 20 
minutes, and then th e next wave would co
me in, then the following wave, and I was 
supposed  to be in th e assault wave.  
Q: He did save your life, yeah. 

A: So it saved Œ it saved my life. 

Q: And quite a few others, I™m sure. 
A: Oh yes. 
Q: Really. 

A: Many thousands of us. So 
we were always grateful for 
Ha rry Truman
 for that. 
However, after going through th e mu seum and seeing wh at 
Roosevelt 
didn™t do, it 
was very upsetting to me. I never really knew 
that he really laid back like that. I was 

not aware of that. 

Q: There was a great, great deal known in 
the political and military highest circles, 
and very little done.  

A: And when I was in 
Israel
, my  daughter and I went to 
Yad Vashem . 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: And you take 
Yad Vashem
 added with this and it™s 
an unbelievable experien ce. 
And I wrote in the memo 
book downstairs that if
 for any reason they built

concen tration camps in the 
United Sta tes
 to put the Jews in 
it, there would be no 
shortage of guard s and no s
hortage of anything, there 
would be many volunteers. 
And it™s unfortunate. So I don™t think 
we have learned a thing from history. 
Q: Human nature has not chan
ged substantially, it seems. 
A: All you have to do is 
look around th e wo rld today at 
Œ almo st every conflict has 
something to do with religion. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: Whether it™s Arab and Muslim or Protes
tant and Catholic, I mean i-it Œ it™s all 
there. 
Q: Do you think that you would have been Œ one of the 
things that we ask people 
about is how politically cognizant they ar
e. Do you think that you would be as 
aware of the conflicts arou
nd th e world now if you ha
d not gone through this 
experience, or if you did not have Jewish background upbringing? 

A: Well, I am Œ 
Q: Has it sensitized you? 
A: I am more sensitive to what™s
 going on around the world. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: You  must re memb e r in  
1943 - 1944, there was no communications like they  had 
today. I me an, you have 
CNN 
showing you wh at™s happening as it happens. We had 

 
Interview with George Pisik

12
nothing like that. We had a newspaper that
 came out days and weeks later and it 
was controlled by the army. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: So what they told  
us, or what we read was strictly
 what they want
ed us to hear. 
And that™s my  story. 
Q: Okay. Couple Œ couple more questi
ons. Do you remember, when you were 
inside 
Da chau
, obviously there were other peop
le from your team, your battalion. 
A: Yes. 

Q: Do you reme mb er any of thei
r reactions? Did anybody get sick? 

A: Yes. Many of us. 
Q: Okay . 
A: The doctor, who was the batta
lion doctor, his name was Dr. 
Rosenberg, 
he 
himself became sick. And he tried, with wh
at limited medical facilities he had, he 
tried to help these people, but there was 
malnutrition, there was starvation, it was 
sores, it was beatings, it wa Œ whatever. And 
he really wasn™t prep
ared for this kind 
of thing. He Œ his stuff was for gunshot 
wounds and things like that, it wasn™t for 
starving and malnutrition. But 
he was trying to  come around and tell us, don™t give 
them franks and beans, you™ll kill them. But 
these people were starving, so we gave 

them biscuits and wh atever canned goods we
 had, we had to open it for them. And 

 
Interview with George Pisik  
 
July 14, 1993 
 

 
 
13
then Œ it™s coming back to me, two of th
e, or three of the men pointed out to 
somebody th at looked like one of them, a
nd he was younger and 
healthy looking, he 
was one of the guard s. 
Q: Right. 
A: And they  wanted him. And we Œ 

Q: What happened? 

A: Œ we gave him the Œ we searched him 
and he was screaming, no, no, I™m Œ but 
they all claimed he was one of the brutal 
guards, and we Œ they to ok him into one of 
the barracks and they killed him with thei
r bare hands. And I 
never went into Œ 
Q: We have had Œ we have 
had other reports of that. 
A: Huh? 

Q: We have had other reports of that, yeah. 

A: Well, I didn™t go in to 
check on it, but I heard the sc
ream. They did it with their 
bare hands, they killed this guy. And Œ 
Q: Did you find or see other German guar
ds laying around th e 
premises that you 
think perhaps the inmates had 
[indecipherable]
 
A: Many of them had changed in to Œ from 
what we had heard, they ch anged in to 
civilian clothes and many of them got away. 
But others that were pointed out were 
taken by the 
MPs
, and what happened to th em
, I don™t know. Also, when  we 

 
Interview with George Pisik

liberated the camp there were many, many bi
cycles lying around.
 And they wanted 
Œ prisoners of the Œ they  wanted to go back to 
Pola nd , Au stria, 
wherever they 
came from. What did we know? Here, take
 a bicycle, go home. And they got on 
their bicycles, they got as fa
r as the gate and then they  
were stopped. They  had to be 
interviewed, they had to be
 examined, you know, so th
ey never got more than a 
couple of hundred yard s, but we gave th
em all the bicycles they wanted. And Œ 
Q: Did you and your Œ the so
ldiers who were with you, di
d you discuss this in the 
following days? Did you talk about it? 
A: First of all, many of them wore the yellow Star of 
David
 
[indecipherable] Jude. 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: I did not see that patch down stairs. I 
mean, I saw patches but I did not see the 
yellow Star of 
David
 th at said  
j-u-d Œ 
or 
j-u-d-e,
 I don™t really remember at th is 
point. And they really Œ I told
 them that these were all Je
wish people and that they 
were being persecuted. And these Southern er
s really, they were sorry to see that, 
you know, anybody was put Œ but they didn™t se
em to care that they were Jewish or 
not. 
Q: Hm, so they did not understa
nd the significance of the whole 
[indecipherable]
 
A: No, yi Œ I™ll tell you all Œ I did, but they  didn™t. 

Q: Yeah. Hm. 

 
Interview with George Pisik

A: They did not, and again you were dea
ling with people who were farmers. Some 
of them could not write, barely. They could 
barely read. I had to tie their shoelaces 
for them, I had to make their 
necktie for them. But if you 
said to them, walk through 
that wall, they would walk 
through that wall. I mean, th
at™s what the army wanted. 
They  didn™t want you to think too mu ch. 
Q: So th ey would have been very , eith
er historically or politically ignoran t. 
A: Yes, we all Œ 
Q: They just simply weren™t exposed. 
A: Well, I was ignorant of what I was getti
ng into and I was a hell of a lot brighter 
than they were. I mean, I had Œ I had one ye
ar of college, and I knew I was Jewish. I 
was Bar Mitzvahed, I knew some
thing about my religion. But Œ 
Q: Before you went overs
eas, I would think th at you 
would have been at least 
clearly aware that 
Hitler™s
 main focus was against the Je
ws. Were you aware of that 
from newspapers back  home, or Œ 
A: Yeah, we knew about the anti-Semitis
m, we knew about Crystal Night and 
things like that, but we had no id ea th
ere were concen tration camp s. And Œ 
Q: Did you still have fa
mily, close family in 
Germany 
or 
Austria
 at the time of the 
war? 
A: No, I had no family in 
Euro pe
 whatsoever, none. So I 
had no co ntact over there,

and – 
[tape break]
 when I came home, Au gust of 1945, I had mezuzahs waiting 
for me in the house from my  grandmother 
and from everybody else. It had made a 
big impression on a large part of th e 
Bronx
. And one of the souvenir Œ it had 
nothing to do with the camp s, one of th
e souvenirs that I 
brought home was a 
swastika flag. And on
 V-E Day Œ
 no, 
V-J Day
, when I was home on leave, my 
mo ther ma de a party fo r whoever wanted to  
drop in. And next door to us were two 
refugees who had left 
Germany
, and when  they saw Œ they
 came to the party and 
they saw the swastika and th
ey  wiped their feet on it a
nd they spit on it. The next 
mo rning Œ 
Q: It was used as a doormat for the party 
[indecipherable]
 
A: Yeah, it was a doormat. The next mo rn
ing my  mo ther didn™
t know what to do 
with this filthy swastika, so she took it to 
the basement of an apartment house in the 
Bronx
, wash ed in the commun
ity washing machine. Th
ere was no dryer. Not 
thinking, my mother put it out
 on the fire escape to dr
y and you could see it all over 
the 
Bronx,
 which was on 
Jerome 
Avenue
 
and  
165
th
 
Street. Within a half hour the 
police were up there knocking on the doo
r, who™s flying the Ge
rman flag? Thank 
God I was wearing my  uniform with the meda
ls, with the whole bit. And I said, oh 
my  God, we had this party last night, and th ere was still liquor on the table and

cookies out. At 10 o™clock in th e mo rning I 
was drinking with th ese two Irish cops 
from the 
Bronx
, and Œ 
Q: It™s 
[indecipherable]
 everyone™s attention. 
A: Œ it was Œ was a very excite Œ it was a very exciting time. And I still have the 
flag. 
[tape break]
 I had brought home as souvenirs a 
Luger
 and a 
Mauser
 pistol, 
absolutely worthless 
to me, but they were in workin
g condition and they were great 
souvenirs. And my mother, this nice, 
little, old Jewish lady who was absolutely 
petrified of firearms, took th e pistols to 
an army depot where they had advertised, 
bring your souvenirs to us and we will deac
tivate them so you 
don™t get killed, or 
you don™t blow yourself up 
with  ha Œ people were br
inging home hand grenad es. 
My mother took these pistol
s and had them pour hot le
ad into the barrel, which 
absolutely wiped out the pistols. And I ha
d them for ma ny years and I finally gave 
them to my nephew also. And I ne
ver really forgav
e her for that. 
Q: Lead in your pistols. Oh 
no, no, no, don™t turn off yet. 
A: Okay . 

Q: When you came back to the 
States
, you know, there™s a Œ a period of reentry. 
You know, you™re getting back in to the Œ I 
assume you did not stay in the Œ in  the 
military? 

A: No.

Q: So there™s a kind of a reentry to civilian life. 
A: When I came out of the service, I spent 
Œ let™s see, I came out in February and I 
think the next week, I went back  to co
llege. And from then on it was school Œ back 
to 
Brooklyn 
College. I met my wife there and 
got married a few years later.  
Q: Did you in those first four or five year
s feel any need to discuss your experiences 
in 
Da cha u
 with Œ say with fri
ends, with family? 
A: Not so much with 
the family, but other friends of 
mine and relatives who were in 
the army , we discussed it among ourselves 
over and over again. But as far as I 
knew, I was the only one of my  group that 
was actually in a working concentration 
camp. And Œ 
Q: Were people receptive? Di
d you run into people who di
dn™t want to hear about 
this because it was too terrible? 
A: No, th ey Œ they had heard, of course 
Œ by th at time they had all heard stories, 
they had all seen pictures. They had asked 
me about it and I told
 them my  side of 
the story, you know, wh at I had seen, which 
seemed to coincide 
with what they had

her war story and y
ou fo rget about it. 
You had your life to lead and these were ju
st war stories that we had been telling 
each other over and over again over the year
s, and pretty soon that was history. 
Q: You kind of leave it, yeah.

A: And then when I trying to tell my
 children about the Holo caust, and Œ 
Q: Mm-hm. 
A: Œ wh ich I did over the years. And maybe not 
Hugh 
so much, but 
Susan 
and 
Sandy
. 
Q: Was there a point in time when you b
ecame more in terested in telling your 
children? For example in 1978
 they did the Holocaust mini-series, w h ich started a 
lot of people talking, for the first time. 
A: I couldn™t watch it.  
Q: Okay . 

A: I absolutely could not watch it. Yet, 
I had no problem going to  the movies and 
watching all those crazy stories, you know
, wh ere three guys wiped out 500 tanks 
you know, with peanuts. That was okay,
 but the mini-serie
s on the Holocaust, I 
couldn™t look at it. 

Q: It was real. 
A: It was re Œ 
Q: 
[indecipherable]
 aw ay . 
A: Œ I knew it was real, I couldn™t do it. 
Q: Yeah. Do you feel like that programs 
like that are imp o rtant, though, to educate 
people who don™t know? 

 
Interview with George Pisik

A: Yes, if people will believe it. Y ou ha
ve people in politics 
today who are Œ who 
say to you, hey, the Holocaust never 
happened. Ho w can you Œ how can they 
reconcile that with the facts? And I™m
 thinking of Œ wh at™s his name , bu Œ
 
Buchanan? 
Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. 
A: I mean here is a man who is an intelligen
t guy, he is a writer, he was an assistant 
to the president, and yet he said the Holo
caust never happened. 
So that™s frightening 
because if he says it there are tens of 
thousands of other pe
ople believe it never 
happened . 

Q: Mm-hm. There is a resurg
ence of Ho locaust deniers 
right now, and I think in 
particular that™s why your testimony™s 
important. A lot of people will ignore 
testimony from survivors, but a lot of pe
ople will listen to 
someone that they 
consider trustworthy, an American and 
a liberator. And I think th at™s one reason 
there™s been such an emphasis on getting 
the testimonies from 
liber ators such as 
yourself. 

A: In 1950 Œ probably 1952 or
 1953, I had made a business 
trip that I Œ down  south 
where my clients were and I went to a town, 
Crowley, Louisiana. 
And there is a 
Catholic priest there who was invited to my
 client™s house for lunch, and I was there 
and in th e course of the conversation he fo
und out that I was Jewish, he said to me, 

 
Interview with George Pisik  
 
July 14, 1993 
 

 
 
21
well, you know, I have to tell you that the 
Holo caust never happened  and I™m telling 
my parishioners that the Holocaust never occu
rred. I said, trying to be as polite as I 
could, I said you™re wrong. I was there a
nd I saw it. He said oh no, the Catholic 
church  wo uld never allow something like th
at, and therefore it never happened . And 
the Catholic church, as it did Œ collabor
ated with them in
 many instances. 
Q: In many ways, in many ways 
[indeciphera ble]
 
A: And who is it, Pope
 Pius?
 He didn™t do much to sa
ve the Jews, although he 
claims he opened up the Vatican to them. 
I was there and they 
had some little thing 
that they had saved 
X
 amount of Jews in the Vatican, 
which is probably true, but he 
could have done a lot mo re, which he didn™t. 
Q: 
[indecipherable]
 
A: Because the story was he wa
s afraid that if he fought 
Hitler
 they would co me 
into the Vatican and just take it over, which 
they didn™t. They le
ft the Vatican alone. 
Q: Yeah, the church as a whole collaborated, I believe. Did your experiences 

change your religious values or y
our religious beliefs in any way? 
A: I was never a religious Jew. I liv
ed by the, you know, like by th e 10 
Commandments. But I was not religious. Two of my  children were 
Bats 
Mitzvahed, 
one wasn™t. And Œ well, I wa
sn™t too upset about that. And I was happy that my  
daughter that did get married, married a Je
wish guy, and it turn ed out to be a Œ a

marital disaster. But I am now more ac
tive in federation, raising money for 
federation. I™ve been to 
Israel
 with my children, but I ca
n™t say that it™s because of 
the Holocaust. 
Q: Okay . 
A: I mean, that was over in history 48 
years ago. And I go to  services, you know, 
the high holidays primarily and I™m active 
in Jewish Federati
on in my  community, 
and that™s about the extent of it. 
Q: Okay. Do you, either at th
at time in 1945, or even to
day, have you come up with, 
in your mind, some sort of un
derstanding or expl
an ation of how 
Hitler
 and the 
Nazis became so powerful, how 
they were so persuasive? 
A: I guess because there was the depression 
and things were very difficult. And like 
today, wh enever thin gs get tough, th
ey need  a scapegoat and the scapegoat 
throughout history has always been the 
Jews. And they were willing to listen to 
him, and hey here Œ look at these, they ha
ve stores, and they were lawyers and they 
were bankers. Not all of them, but enough of
 them that were very visible, and they 
were very easy to go after them. T h a-That
™s my reasoning, I don™t know if history 
supports my  contention. 
Q: That™s a large factor that™s usually
 cited in mo st historical analysis. 
A: And it will happen again.

Q: What can we do? What 
can Œ what can be done different? How can we re-
educate people or how can we ch ange people? 
A: Well, it has to start in school. They 
have to be educated
 and told what the 
Holo caust was. They  have to be told wh
at brought it on and what the outcome was. 
And I™m sorry to say that in 
Bo ca Ra to n, F lo rida
, which is a rather affluent 
society, I have spoken to so me friends Œ children of frie
nds of mine, grandchildren, 
I should say, who go to  school, Jewish ki
ds, half of them never heard of the 
Holo caust. They  have no id ea 
what the Holocaust is. And the non-Jewish kids have 
no id ea what the Holocaust is. They don™t te ach it in school that I know of. I don™t 

even think it™s in the history books
. If it is, it™s just a paragraph. 
Q: Right. Very briefly. 

A: And it™s nothing and it has to start at the 
root level, it has to start at the s Œ with 
the school system and work  its way up. 

Q: What about churches and synagogues? 
Do you feel like that™s a appropriate 
place to address this? 
A: Excuse me? 

Q: What about church es and synagogu
es, was that an appropriate forum? 
A: I think tha Œ particularly the 
churches because the Œ the Jews 
[indecipherable]
 
you know, are symp athetic to the Jews, and 
the parents should te
ll the children what

the Holo caust was. But you™re going tw o ge
nerations now. My 
grandchildren, who 
live in Boston, I don™t see th
em th at much, one is 10 and 
one is eight, I™m sure they 
have no idea what the Holocaus
t is. But when I see them in a couple of weeks, I 
think I will tell them 
ag ain what happened. 
Q: Good, good. 
A: I don™t know if my daughter has ever 
told them or explained it to them, but I 
think she should. 
Q: Perhap s there would be some way for yo
u to speak in the public schools in your 
area. I mean 
[indecipherable]
 Œ 
A: Well, I haven™t thought of it. 

Q: Œ consider that? I mean, I think that 
children respond to Œ to someone who was 
there in a way that they don™t respond to 
a textbook, you know, or
 to a lecture. And 
that can be a very powerful teaching tool sometimes. 

A: I think if we could get some of the actua
l survivors with the tattoos on their arm, 
but I have seen nothing in the local pa
pers even  suggesting anything like that. 
Q: Mm. To have surv ivors and liberator
s come and share together would be 
wonderful. 

A: Well Œ 
Q: Be a terrific experience.

A: Maybe I™ll bring it up when  I get back. 
Q: I hope so. That would be Œ 

A: But they have to start with the scho
ol system. Now, many blacks do not, as a 
group feel that this never happened. Wh en
 you bring blacks through here, what is 
their reaction? 

Q: I™ve only been here three days, I don™t know. 

A: Oh. 
Q: I™m from 
Atlanta
 and I™m just up here on a research trip. 
A: Okay . 
Q: But that would be 
something to ask Dr.

A: No, it wasn™t that warm. It was early
 May, and I was wearing Œ no, we were 
wearing co tton unifo rms, so it Œ I don™t 
remember the weather being any factor. 
Q: Yeah. Were there Œ were there a lot of
 people in your Œ how many people were 
in your unit, roughly. Were
 you 50, were you a hundred ?

A: In the Œ in the Œ th
e army, in my outfit? 
Q: In your Œ in your Œ yeah. 
A: Several thousand. 
Q: And all of you liberated the camps Œ 
A: I don™t know how many battalions came 
in. I know my battalion came in. Don™t 
forget, a Œ a division had like 12,000 men, 
and we were shooting all over the place. 
And my  battalion, which was probably a 
thousand men, wa Œ I know that battalion 
was there and sp read out throughout the whole area. 

Q: Right. 

A: These camps were big. So what I saw, 
other people saw in other are Œ in other 
areas. 

Q: But Œ so your unit had a thousand men in it? Comp any 
D [indecipherable]
 
A: Well, Company 
B
 only had 200. 
Q: Okay, that Œ that seems like a far mo re manageable number. And in that final 
assault, when you were moving fast a
nd you knew that something was going on and 
mail wasn™t catching up and you weren™t be
ing dropped food, and Œ I mean, did you 
know that you were he
ading into so mething? 

 
Interview with George Pisik  
 
July 14, 1993 
 

 
 
27
A: Oh, we Œ combat was pretty much 
over by this time because as we were 
squeezing the Germans, we were coming 
from one side and the Russians were 
coming from the other side. 
Q: Right. 
A: And they knew it was over, 
so what they  did was, they
 were giving up, they were 
surrendering by the hundred s, by th e 
thousands. And we knew they were 
surrendering because the Germans had a 
Œ a unique way of surrendering. They 
threw their steel helmets away. If you sa
w a German soldier without his steel 
helmet, he was surrendering. 

Q: And that™s how you knew not to shoot 
him? That™s how you knew not to shoot 
him? 

A: Well, they wen Œ they threw Œ the firs
t thing th ey did were
 throw their guns 
away. 

Q: Really? 
A: Because when they
 came out, wherever they came
 out like this without their 
steel helmet on, it wa Œ it was Œ here th
ey were coming out by th e thousands, and 
we didn™t know what
 to do with them. 
Q: And they were in bad condition themselves? 
A: No, not bad, though Œ

Q: They Œ they™d  been  eating, and 
[indecipherable] 
A: Yeah, they weren™t in bad sh ape. But by
 this time what we were running into 
were kids maybe 15 - 16 - 17 years old 
and 60 and 70 year old older men. The 
younger ones were Œ were
 gone already, pretty mu ch. And if we found 
SS
 troopers, 
which we did, now they were very cute. The
 SS 
troopers
 
tattooed the 
SS
 insignia on 
their shoulder, and they were very proud 
of it. It had like a lightning bolt with  the 
SS
, and our Intelligence people said, if th
ey™re young and they™re
 healthy and they 
got blue eyes, they got blonde
 hair and they  look like Œ go 
look Œ rip their shirts off 
and look at the Œ and we found them, after 
Dachau
. And we had a German 
comp any co mmander who asked Sergeant 
Go ld stein
 and myself to take these 
SS
 
troopers back to the prisoner of war. He said
 probably  eight or 10
 miles in the back 
and I want you back here in 20 minutes. 
And he said, make sure you have your 
side-arms with you when you 
take them back. Bu t 20 minutes later I want you back 
here. 
Q: Did you accept? 
A: Yeah, they Œ we were ba
ck in less than 20 minutes.  
Q: What happened to  the 
SS
?  
A: They tried to escape. 

Q: And what did you do?

A: Oh, I Œ 
Q: Let them go? 

A: Oh yeah, they™ll never Œ 
but they didn™t go anywhere. You can™t do that, that™s 
not Œ that™s against all the rules and regu
lations. You can™t shoot prisoners of war. 
But they never got to the prisoner of wa
r camp and we were back in 20 minutes. 
Q: Do you think that your tr
eatment of German civilians 
changed, or your feelings 
even toward German civilians changed? 
A: When we were going thro
ugh some of the towns, little ole Œ the truth, little old 
ladies would aim hunting rifles out of a wi
ndow and shoot. Fortunately they were 
lousy shots. Our orders were, do not go 
in after them. W e had something called 
thermite
 grenades. 
Thermite
 grenades wo uld burn through six steel helmets in 30 
seconds. So we would take a 
thermite 
grenade and throw it into the window and 
just keep going. And with
in minutes that building wa
s completely engulfed in 
flames. We never Œ he said, 
don™t get yourself involved
, you™ll only Œ you can get 
hurt. Just burn the building down, let 
them take care of 
themselves. Yeah, 
thermite
 
grenades, I haven™t said that word 
in a long time. Any other question? 
Q: Were you and 
Go ldstein
 the only Jews in your 
battalion, your division? 
A: There weren 't many more. There were

probably three Jews.

Q: Right, you know, Grandma rais
ed a smarter guy, because the 
ASTP 
program 
was cancelled. 
A: Yeah, well I know, that™s how I ended

Q: Oh yeah, it just seems Œ 
A: Intelligence. 
Q: Œ they  dump ed ev erybody, it

A: I was in Œ I Œ right out to the front
 lines, riding in the back of a tank. 
Q: How long had you been serving? How 
lo ng had you been overseas when  you got 
to the camp? It Œ it had been years, hadn™t it? 

A: I was overseas February and March Œ 

Q: 
[indecipherable]
 would say? 
A: I was overseas about a year and a half. 

Q: I remember you telling me when the Œ the 
Persian Gulf

e duty, too, it wasn™t just Œ

A: Well, when we came back 
on this ship, we were told that our division was going 
to land in 
New York City
 and there™s going to be parade up
 Fifth 
Avenue. Oh, I Œ I 
mean, from a kid from 
New York City, 
we knew wh at a ticker tape parade was. 
And two days out they said, oh, the 
orders have changed, we™re going to  
Newport 
News, Virginia,
 no parade. Very upsetting. But th
ere were German prisoners of war 
who were work ing the commiss
ary at the army camp, Camp
 Patrick Henry
 in
 
Newpo rt News, Virg i n ia
. And we were told, said look 
fellas, be Œ they been here 
for awhile and they™re
 the cooks and they™re the clea
n up and they™re whatever, they 
do all the dirty work . So if you start anythi
ng with them, you™re 
going to go into the 
kitchen an d do the dirty wo rk. And we found 
that the German prisoners of war were 
doing the grass cutting, sitting 
on tractors with umbrellas 
over their head. Or they 
were working in the laundries with the 
American women, and we were out there 
busting our backsides out in th e hot sun. A
nd th Œ I™m just trying to correlate how 
they were treated over here and how the pr
isoners were treated over there. So you Œ 
as you know, I have no Œ no love for th
e Germans, or the German people. You 
know when I told
 you about Uncle
 Ben™s
 
Mercedes
? He got a new 
Mercedes
 years 
ago and I said, 
Ben
, what is that little door over th
ere, you know? He said, well 
that™s the glove compartment. 
I said, no it isn™t, that™s 
a microwaveoven
 for Jewish 
babies. He got 
very upset.

the camps, or when you were first g o ing 
through there, what Œ didn™t Œ 
didn't you see, what was it, the 
Mercedes
 emblem or 
other Œ other s Œ 
A: I believe and I Œ people told me I™m wr
ong, but I believe that 
on one of the ovens 
I saw the 
Mercedes-Benz 
emblem on the oven door. Ot
her Œ have you heard that? 
Q: I haven™t heard that, but there were a number of major businesses and industries 
that were in that immediat
e area and they contracted fo
r the slave labor force. So, 
it™s certainly possible. I had not heard that before.  

A: Well, people tell me  that I Œ I didn™t se
e it, because they  didn™t see it, but don™t 
forget, in 1945, I wasn™t ev
en sure what the Œ the embl
em was, but I Œ I thought I 
saw the 
Mercedes
 emb lem on the Œ on the oven d
oors. Th-They co uld have been , 
you know. 

Q: Were the Œ there were no guards, just
 the trustees? I mean, there were no Œ 
A: No, many of the guards had left, but 
we did get a bunch of them. And this one 
group that asked for a guard , a particular 
guard, we gave it to them. We Œ we s Œ 
made sure he had no weapons and we th
rew him into the barracks with the men. 
And they Œ they tore him 
limb  from limb . And they hardly had th e strength. 
Q: Were there other souvenirs, so to spea
k, or any kind of 
looting going on in  the 
camps?

A: Well, I told you, I had that cat o™nine
 tails, which I carried around with me for 
several weeks and th en one day I looked  
at it and said wh at am I gonna do with a 
whip with the leather thong
s with thumbtacks in it, 
and I just threw it away. 
Q: Right. 
A: But, if I hadn™t seen it, in my mind I 
still see it, with the thumbtacks with a little 
bit of flesh on it, on one of the tacks. An
d the handle was only about that big, and 
strips of leather about that big and they wo
uld just whip the prisoners with it. And I 
had the flag and I had the, you know, 
the bayonet I brought home, I don™t know 
what happened to that
. Remember the bayonet? 
Q: Mom managed to lose it in the move, I bet. 
A: Yeah, probably. Any other questions? 
Q: You said you had a leg injury? 

A: I had no time to bathe or chan ge my  
shoes or wh atever, and by the time the war 
was over, I had developed a ve
ry , very bad case of impetigo and oh I forgot the 
word that they use fo
r the feet with the Œ

A: And when we went back to the 
United States
, I was on sick call and they put me 
in the hospital, the Œ and th
ey put hot comp resses on my  
feet for a week and they 
painted my  feet with potassium permangana
te. Violet gentian? So mething like that. 
And it cured it. And even though I really wasn
™t cured, they told me that I could go 
home on leave, 30 day leave. But I could bare
ly walk when I got on
 that ship. It was 
four weeks before I Œ I hadn™t take
n my shoes off. Didn™t have time. 
Q: So you were moving th
at fast or that long? 
A: Yeah, I was scratch ing with the rifle bu
tt, I was scratching 
my toes through the 
leather shoe, trying to get some relief.  

Q: I would assume, too, you mentioned earlie
r that supplies were having a real hard 
ta Œ time keeping up with you because you were moving so  fast, so that you were 

not necessarily ge
tting fresh socks Œ 
A: Ti Œ we weren™t getting noth ing. 

Q: Œ wh en you were supposed to, at all. 
A: We were getting nothing, we were livi
ng Œ when we came to a farmyard, my 
Southerners were wonderful. They™d run 
out and grab a chicke
n and they™d  wring 
its neck, you know, and the whole thing. And 
then they said to 
me, Sarge, it™s your 
term Œ your turn to kill a ch
icken. So I took a machine 
gun out of the half-track, a 
45 caliber machine gun and I couldn™t hit th
e chicken Œ thank God I didn™t hit the

chicken with it. They  were laughing so  ha
rd th ey Œ th-they fell down crying they 
were laughing so  hard. So th
ey killed the chicken and I di
d all the rest of the dirty 
work for them. I wrote their letters for th
em and I Œ I had to mo ther them, they 
couldn™t do it themselves. But 
they were great soldiers. 
Q: And the army  made no effort to explai
n or debrief that yo
u had Œ what you had 
seen? 
A: No, nobody cared. Ther
e were millions of us.  
Q: Had you seen things up to th at point th
at were incrementally 
as awful, and that 
this was just another Œ 

A: Well, d-don™t forget, there is artillery
 shells, there was 
bombing. We saw many 
dead bodies Œ 

Q: So it™s like 
[indecipherable]
 
A: Œ but most of the dead bodies we 
saw were Œ were Germans, or civilians. 
Q: Right. 
A: It really didn™t bother 
me too much. Hey, they were 
the enemy. That™s the idea, 
we were there to kill them. But th-the help
less families, with th
e children, with Œ I 
really didn't see Œ come to think of it, I don™t think I saw children in 
Dach au
. I 
mean, I sa w adults. Now, the children I know 
were there, I didn™t see any. At that 
stage of time they may have
 been all killed already.

Q: That™s what it mo st people mention, is
 that either they saw very, very few 
children or none at all. 
A: I don™t rememb er seeing any. 
Q: Cause by that time they had already be
en disposed of, yeah
. So it was clear to 
you coming in, having seen other battle 
dead, that this was something different. 
A: Yes. 
Q: This was not like a regular war zone, this was something Œ 
A: A war zone didn™t bother me. 
Q: Okay . 

A: This bothered me, cause we realized what
 it was, we Œ we could see what it was, 
these people told us what it was. And it wa
s such a complete s
hock. Nothing in my  
background ever could prepare me. It coul
dn™t prepare anybody for something like 
this. 

Q: Could you sp eak Yiddish at the time? 
A: Yeah, I probably spoke a little Yiddish, and Œ 
Q: So did th e prisoners 
try to talk to you? 
A: Œ but it wasn™t enough, it really wasn™t
 enough to communicat
e with this woman 
who spoke German. And we have, a lot of 
guys in the outfit could speak German,

so we were able to communicate very eas
ily. But Œ but that me
zuzah business, that 
was the funniest thing, i-if you co
uld call it funny, wh at happened. 
Q: It™s an amazing story. Wasn™t Œ 
didn™t Grandma say something to the 
Brooklyn 
News, 
or something, and 
you™re even getting 
[indecipherable]
 
A: Well, it was Œ I think it got into the 
Bronx Home News
, and that also with the Œ 
with the mezuzahs. Th-The
y™re probably still 
following me, trying to find me. 
Q: Make sure th
at you have one. 
A: I came b ack pretty quickly after. I was back in the 
United States
 in August. I got 
back in Ju ly. From May Œ 

Q: From May eighth to August, were you 
part of military government? What did 
you do until you came home? 

A: We Œ yeah, we were cleaning up areas, se
arching for soldiers, 
searching for arms 
and ammu nition. And almo st immediately 
we were ordered to go back to the 
United States
 and prep are to go to 
Japan.
 So me people went by way of 
India
. We 
were lucky, we went back toward  
America
 and then we were 
supposed to go to 
California.
 After the bomb was dropped, I still had to report to Camp  
Roberts Œ 
not Camp  
Rob,
 one of the camps in 
California
. And we were waiting for orders to 
go overseas and they  never came and we we
re told, okay fellas, you™re going home. 
And February 14
th
, I went home.

Q: Up until you left in August, did you 
have opportunities to 
talk with German 
civilians? 
A: Yes, but it was strictly as a do this, 
and do that and you kno
w, clean this up and 
it was not the man to man friendly Œ this 
was still right after the war. We weren't 

allowed to fraternize with 
them. All the hanky panky w
ith the women and all that, 
that came later, I guess, after we left. But 
we were in a town with a big sawmill and 
we had told the Germans to start cutting two 
by fours, they needed  it for something. 
And the guy deliberately, th
e foreman burnt out the moto
r by jamming the throttle 
forward in stead of doing it grad ually. 
And one of the boys who n Œ from the 
southern boys said, he™s doing that deliber
ately, because he knows he™s burning out 
the mo tor. So this southern boy put a pistol 
up to his head  and said Œ and they  got Œ 
he got the point, you do it now and you 
do it right or we put a bullet into you. 
Within an  hour th ey had it changed 
and everything ran very smoothly. 

Q: Smoothly . 
A: But they could have done it all day a
nd all night, I wouldn™t have known what 
they were doing wrong. So this is my 
very limited exposure 
with the population. 
Q: Okay. The reason I had wondered was beca
use a lot of liberators report that they 
got blanket denial from all German  ci
vilians that they had any knowledge. 
A: Oh, I never Œ I never met a Nazi. I never met a Œ

Q: That™s right. 
A: The Œ the German soldiers, at first th
ey said, you know, me? N-Ni Œ Nazi, no, 
not me. Maybe him, not me. 
Q: Did you go into  their homes very mu ch? 
A: Yeah, we t Œ we went into their homes  to take them over for Œ for barracks for 

ourselves. And one of the expressions I reme mb er was 
raus
(ph) the house. Out of 
the house, leave. And one of them said in 
English, where am I gonna go? I said after 
Œ after 
Dach au
, I didn™t give a damn, out. We threw out little old ladies, we threw 
out grandmas, it was raining, out.
 I don™t care where they went. 
Q: So there definitely was a 
change in the feeling after 
[indeciphera ble]
 
A: Oh, no problem with that. 

Q: Okay .
