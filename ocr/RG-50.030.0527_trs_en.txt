ADA USTJANAUSKAS 
 November 17, 2008 
 
Beginning Ta pe One 
 
Question: We ll, this morning we are conducting 
an interview with Ada Gens Ustjanauskas and 
following her life story. Thank you very, very muc
h, Mrs. Ustjanauskas for comi ng and talking 
to us. This is going to be a ve
ry broad story with ma ny differen
t components, and ma ny different 
people who are in it. It will be 
a -- a glimpse into at least what happened with one person in a 
very tough part of the world, in Lithuania. And I 
would like to start, as we  often do, at the very 
beginning. I™d like to find out 
about your background, where you were born, the family you were 
born into, the details about your 
early life. So let us start w
ith that. Where were you born? 
Answer: Smalininkai. Smalininkai. 

Q: And is that a village or a town? 

A: I would call 
it a little town. 
Q: And where is it cl ose to? 

A: It™s close -- it™s on the German border. My birt
h certificate is in German and in Lithuanian. It 

was like a style in those days, you had a baby bor
n in Germany, and my mother was on the way 
to Germany. Right on the border,
 I was born. She didn™t ma ke it to
 the German border, but as I 
say, my birth certificate is both in German a
nd in Lithuanian. So we have no idea about 

Smalininkai, we didn™t live there. She 
just happened to be traveling through. 
Q: And your birth date is? 

A: October 9, 1926. 

Q: And whe r e was your mother comi ng from?  

A: At that time  my fathe r  was teaching in th
e high school, Jewish high school in Jurbarkas.

Q: Uh-huh. 
A: That™s where she came from, from 
Jurbarkas to have me  in Germany.  
Q: Can you tell me  a little bit about -- first of 
all, Smalininkai was stil
l a Lithuani an territory 
village or town, is that correct? 

A: Border town. 

Q: It was a border town -- 

A: Border town. 

Q: -- but it did not belong to Germany? 

A: No. 

Q: Okay. And was it -- can you tell me a little bit 
about the -- the borde r was to what part of 

Germany?  

A: Prussy?  

Q: Prussia. 
A: Prussia. 
Q: Prussia, okay. Then let™s go back to Jurbarka
s. What did -- what ki
nd of a place was that? 
A: I don™t know. It™s a town. I was rem -- I reme
mber being there with high school for literary 

competition, I believe. It  was a small 
town in Lithuania, not a big town. 
Q: Was it close to Kaunas? 

A: No. 

Q: Wa s it close to [indecipherable] city?  No? 

A: No, no, no. We  -- I reme mber we t
ook a river boat to 
go to Jurbarkas. 
Q: So you don™t have any me mories of -- 

A: No, none whatsoever. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527

Q: Okay. Tell me a little bit about your earliest memories. 
A: Kaunas. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Father was attending -- at the same time he 
was teaching, he  was attending university, and the 
only way of communication at that
 time  was taking a riverboat. 
It was too strenuous, too long. So 
he decided to move to Kaunas to
 attend his studies. So, what I 
reme mber first, I remember my 
kindergarten. And in those days, what was know
n in -- not known in United States, but it was 
very well known in Lithuania, Mo
ntessori system kindergarten. 
Q: Oh, you were in th
e Montessori system? 
A: Montessori system, and the person who had -- who was the leadi
ng person was Professor 
[indecipherable]. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: She started that. Fr om the Montessori, I went
 to German kindergarten. And when my mother 
brought me  to school to enter me  into the first gr
ade and they checked my a bilities, they told my 
mother that, you know, your child does
n™t belong in first grade. In 
first grade we use ma tches to 
count. Your daughter can wr
ite and read and count. We  should put her into second grade, but she 
is too young, she is only four and a half years old. So -- 

Q: So what did they do? 

A: -- to ma ke a long story short, I finish high sch
ool at 14 and a half. I ju
mped three years in the 
meanti me. I never discuss it becau
se it™s not very believable and 
there were only two cases in 
Lithuania. One was Kutraga, Dr. Kutraga™s son, 
he was 15 and a half, I was 14 and a half. But 
when we came to United States, it just happened 
that the principal of my  high school and my 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
4 
 
first teacher lived in Hartford. I never talked a
bout myself, but they told everybody. So they s -- 
this is no mystery any more, you know, no secret any more. So -- 
Q: But you went from Montessori 
school to a German kindergarten? 
A: Yes. 

Q: We™ll come to your schoo
ling in a little while -- 
A: Now -- 

Q: -- I™d like to come  back to that. But your fi
rst me mories are of th
is Montessori school. 
A: Yeah, that™s right. 

Q: Do you have any picture in your mi nd of -- 

A: Oh yes, I reme mber. I reme mber, for example , 
during the bell, we were too small, there was a 
little wooden block, we could stop th
e -- step on the block, ring the be
ll by ourselves. We were to 
be -- to take our clothes -- co
ats by ourselves, hang it on a peg, th
e pegs were lower. Everything 
we had to do ourselves, and I don™t reme mber too mu
ch about the activities, 
I just reme mber that 
I hated to drink cocoa because it 
had a skin of milk on the top. That I reme mber very well. So, 
we™re comi ng now to the school. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Elementary school. 

Q: Yes. 

A: They told my mother that they
 are a little bit worried 
that at my age I™ll star
t, but the- they told 
her, don™t worry, if we see that she is falling be
hi nd, we™ll just very naturally, gr adually put her 
back, one year backwards. We ll, it 
never came to that. So I fini shed second grade, I finished third 
grade, and then I took exams to high school. 

Q: And this was you were st
ill in the German school? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
5 
 
A: No, that was already Marija Pe
kauskait
¡
 gymnasium.  
Q: So that was a Lithuanian school. 
A: It was a Lithuanian 
school. It was private. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Expensive, and I went through it. Now, after I t
ook the exams to first cla
ss, I continued at that 
school. In Lithuanian language
 it was called pono gymnasium. 
Q: Pono?  

A: Pono. 

Q: Mm-hm. And how would you translate that? 

A: We ll, we had the children of 
-- our cabinet mi nister™s childre
n, heads of departme nt children, 
children of very rich people. 

Q: So, the elite? 

A: Elite, ye ah. 
Q: The elite. 
A: Elite, ye ah. 

Q: So it wasn™t the of-official name  of the school -- 

A: No, it was not official -- 

Q: -- it was the unofficial name  of the school. 

A: -- it was unofficial name  of the school. In 
those days the governme nt high schools, were 
charging 100 litas per year. In our school it wa
s 400. So not everybody was able to afford it.  
Q: Let me take -- st op at that mo ment for a mo
me nt, because  that begs a lot of questions, and 

then we™ll go back a little bit. 

A: All right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
6 
 
Q: And th -- because the question, 
the first one is, how is it your fa
mily could afford it?  And then 
the question that come s after that
 is, who was your fa mily?  So let™s go back to mother and father. 
Can you tell me  a little bit abou
t your mother?  Who she was, where she was born, what her name  
was, what her family wa s like. And the same  then for your father. 

A: Mama ™s father left Lithuania during the Ts
ar™s occupation. We don™t 
know too much, we just 
know that in those years, the Tsar used to 
send people for bringing il
legal literature, from 
Germany, from Prussia to Lithuania. And ma ny pe
ople tried to escape when they knew that it 
came close to being arrested, they es -- mostly 
escaped either to United States, or to South 
America. He left Lithuania and he
 settled in Montevideo, Uruguay. 
Q: How ma ny brothers and 
sisters di d she have?  
A: She had one sister and two brothers. Afterawhile her father tookthe youngest brother to 

Montevideo, Uruguay, and a sister and 
a brother stayed in Lithuania. 
Q: She was born when? 
A: Mama  was born 1900. 
Q: And her name  was? 

A:  El - E l v er a. 

Q: Uh-huh. And her last name ?  

A: Boudraker. Boudrakiter. 

Q: Uh-huh, so Elvera Boudraker -- 

A: Boudra -- Boudrakiter in Lithuani
an, Boudraker that she used here. 
Q: Wa s she the youngest, the oldest? 

A: She was the oldest. She was the oldest. What
 I know about Mama; Mama finished again an 

elite high school in Riga, Latvia. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
7 
 
Q: How could that be afforded if her father had le
ft her mother with four 
-- three, four children 
and -- and had -- and had gone to Montevid
eo? How could the fa mily afford -- 
A: 1900™s were Tsar™s time .  
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Tsar™s time. And it was call -- called Li ktroic
h it™s a famous high school. Mama  was fluent, 
but I mean really fluent in French, German, 
Russ ian, Polish and Lithuanian. And whe n the war 
started -- 

Q: Which war? 

A: First World Wa r. She was working with famo us
 Polish refugee commi ttee. Must be in ™17 - 
™18, around that time. 

Q: Back in Lithuania? 

A: Back in they -- that wa s still, I believe, in Riga. 

Q: In Latvia. 
A: In Latvia. 
Q: We ll, excuse me , I must go back to the other question. 

A: Yeah? 

Q: When you say it was the Tsar™s time, neverthele
ss, she is a girl who come s from a  fa mily and 
we don™t know what kept that
 family going financially. 
A: I can™t answer. I don™t know whether the grandf
ather used to send something or not, tha -- I 
really have no idea. But they must have had means. 

Q: Okay. 

A: Because that -- that particular high school
 was like my high school, 
was elite high school and 
somehow they managed. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
8 
 
Q: Okay. 
A: Now, because she worked in that famous 
Polish refugee co mmi -- assistance committee, that 
actually what  later helped us to get to the we
st, that fact. Anyway, when Mama  returned to 

Lithuania, she started to work for our governme nt. 

Q: That me ans the -- 

A: Lithuanian nu -- new -- 

Q: Independent -- 

A: -- independent governme nt which was for ming in 
those days. I have a ve
ry interesting picture 
of the -- maybe about 40 males and my mother, 
a lone fema le sitting in the mi ddle, which -- 
which we received from a person who was depor
ted to Siberia and ha
nded a picture to my 
mother™s nephew, who was serving in ri -- Sovi
et army. Anyway, Mama  worked all these years 
during the formation of L
ithuania and that™s where she me t my father.  
Q: That was one of my questions. 
A: That™s where she me t my father. They were 
fighting. It was, if you know, Shirvintu Yedraichu 
Baras. That™s the place where the biggest 
fights for independence were taking place. 
Q: In what years would you say?  Wa s  that 1918, or -- 
A: 1918 -- 

Q: 1918. 

A: -- yeah, 1918. This was if you -- if you not fa m
iliar with Lithuanian hi story, at that time we 
had to fight the [indecipherable] army, the Berm
ontas Soviet army, the Polish army, and we had 
fr ont on three sides. The f- fa mous battles of Sh
irvi ntu Yedrai chu were the most diffi cult to 
conduct over there. That™s 
-- that™s where the officer
s were sent for a couple
 of days, like we call 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
9 
 
in this country for recreation. To
 relax couple of days and go back
 to the front. That™s where she 
me t  my  fa t h e r . 
Q: So he is now introdu
ced into the pictur e. 

A: Yes. 

Q: Can you tell us a little bit about him,
 his fa mi l y, where he was born and so on? 
A: My grandmother on father™s side had five s
ons. No daughters, just five sons. Youngest one 
died in his infancy and the four sons grew
 up. Papa was born in a farming village called 
Illovi eciai, [i ndecipherable] not t
oo far from the city of Siauliai. 

Q: Mm-hm. Was he the youngest, the oldest? 

A: He was the oldest one. 

Q: And wha t  year was he born? 

A: One asa -- 1903.  

Q: So he was younger than your mother? 
A: Three years. 
Q: I see. And his name  was? 

A: Jacobus. 

Q: Jacobus. And his -- 

A: I™m not used to this Jacob Gens 
and some body. Wa s always Jacobus Gensus. 

Q: I see. And his brothers, what were their name s? 

A: Next one was Salavonus Gensus. 

Q: Salomon?  Solomon? 

A: Yes. Next one was Ephraimus. We us
ed to call hi m Froizim, it™s shorter. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
10 
 
A: And the fourth one wa s Rudunus. Rufka. 
Q: Reuben. 

A: Reuben. 

Q: What kind of a fa mily was this?  What wa
s their -- how did they ma ke their living? 
A: All I know, that while the grandfather was 
not too sick, he was -- 
he had very, very bad 
asthma . Until that time he was trading with -- what do you call it?  [indecipherable] 

Q: Trading crabs?  I don™t underst -- it was -- 

A: Something -- the small ones. 

Q: Oh yeah, little crabs. 

A: Little crabs, right. 

Q: So it was some  sort of seafood? 

A: He sold some  sort of seafood. 

Q: Okay. 
A: And that was a big enterprise. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: But the -- 

Q: It™s interesting cause it™s not
 a -- not anywhere near the ocean. 
A: We ll, but you know they -- some how they managed to bring it in. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: All I remember, that twice a year I would st
ay two weeks each for Christma s and two wits -- 
weeks each for Easter in Shonay -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- with my grandparents. But at that time
 already grandfather di
d not leave the bed. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
11 
 
Q: So he was ill. 
A: He was very ill. It was a very -- ho
w should I say, norma l Lithuanian family. Both 
grandparents were blonde, blue-e yed. Neither one looked Jewish. 

Q: But it was a Jewish family. 

A: Jewish family, right. 

Q: Yes. 

A: All sons attended Lithuanian 
schools, all sons attended Lithuanian universities and it was, to 
them it was a n -- norma l thing. They felt Lithuanian. 

Q: Was it a religious family? 

A: No. 

Q: And do you know why?  Do yo -- would -- did that
 question ever come  up as to why it was not 
a particularly religious fa mily? 

A: The question never was an issue, because 
my mother™s family was n-neither. So -- 
Q: So both -- and your mother™s 
family was what -- what -- what
 would have been her religious 
background, had it been a religious one? 

A: Oh, a Roma n Catholic. 

Q: A Ro ma n  Catholic. 

A: Yes. 

Q: So, in other words, your mother was Roma n 
Catholic, your father Jewish, but neither was -- 
A: Jewish, and there was no clash, no, not at all. 

Q: Not -- and -- but there was al
so no great adherence to -- 
A: To -- to one anoth -- 

Q: -- one another™s traditions. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
12 
 
A: Yes. 
Q: I see -- 

A: They never changed religions. There was ne
ver a conversation, would you get baptized or 
would you accept ju -- Judaism, neve
r, never. And I was left alone. They never pushed me  into 
one direction or the other. In those days in Li
thuania, all our birth cer
tificates were religious. 
Mine was not. I had the German 
birth certificate. It was like we
 didn™t have civil -- Lithuania 
didn™t have any civil ceremonies, only -- 

Q: But it see -- 

A: -- only religious ones. 

Q: But it is am -- it is an intere
sting kind of irony, if you were born 
in a border town that is still 
within the territory of the state of Lithuania,
 yet your birth certif
icat e is in German -- 
A: German - -  

Q: -- and it™s civil. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: It™s a little bit 
strange. Some thing -- 
A: It™s -- it is strange. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: You don™t have it usually, because it -- toda
y you could -- you don™t have it in Lithuania any 
more, it™s not that the church give
s you birth certificate. Today it --
 you go to city hall and get it. 
But in those days Lithuania didn
™t have it. So that™s why I es
caped all that, you know, big issue. 
It never bothered me , and it never bothered my paper -- parents. 

Q: So you didn™t -- you didn™t go to
 any Catholic religious -- 
A: No. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
13 
 
Q: -- classes, you never went to any -- 
A: No. 

Q: -- Jewish classes. 

A: We had -- we had -- we had the acr -- rabbi,
 we had the Lutheran and we had the Orthodox 
and we have Roma n Catholic pr iest s teaching at 
the high school. The -- quite a few of us stayed 
away from religious -- not only Jewish children 
who were in school, but also the -- we  had some  
Orthodox, we had some  of a -- Lutherans, who didn™
t attend either. So we just spent that hour, 
you know, waiting outside. 

Q: Oh, so you™re saying in the public schools, ther
e was a li -- religious cl
ass, is that ri -- 
A: Oh yes. 

Q: Okay. 

A: Oh yes. 

Q: And wha t ever religion you happened to belong to -- 
A: You had to -- you -- you-- if you wanted, you had -- 
Q: Did your parents tell you the story of 
how they me t?  Did you ever learn -- 
A: Oh yes. 

Q: Okay, so tell us the story of how they me t. 

A: It -- I ha -- I reme mb er Mama telling that  my 
father approached her, and she had -- she didn™t 
know hi m at all, and she was kind of trying to -- not get rid of hi
m, but tried not to get into a 

conversation, there was -- there was no prope
r introduction or anything. And he was very 
persistent. She had no idea about 
his nationality or his religion
 or anything. And some how -- 
some how they started to date. I know only one th
ing, that at that time 
my  father was engaged. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
14 
 
And Ma ma  only told me  that she reme mberslooking through the window, seeing grandmother 
come  to that place where h-he was stationed at that time . 

Q: His moth er? 

A: His mother. And she -- he told 
her la --  later on that she was 
trying to persuade him to drop -- 
see -- whoever he is seeing and come  back to Siau
liai when he™ll be able 
and to stay with his 
fiancé. She did not persuade him. I don™t know Ma
ma™s year of marriage,
 but if I was born in 
™26, probably must have been ma rried some wher
e around ™24 - ™23. You see, in those days, in 
Lithuania, I think in the entire
 country, you couldn™t count to 10 
to find mixed ma rriages. It was 
very, very unusual. It was even worse than in 
those days in United States if you had a black and 
white ma rriage. It was unheard of. 

Q: So this is -- 

A: It was unheard of. I think what -- what ma ke 
my mother decide to -- to do it, fi rst of all, I 
would describe him as -- not as a Jew in Lit
huania, but a Lithuanian of Jewish extraction.  
Q: Is that how she saw him?  

A: No, she saw him who he is, but I mean, th
at made it easier to get into the marriage. 

Q: For her?  

A: For her, I think so. 

Q: And for him?  

A: For him?  They were not religious people, so 
that didn™t mean anything. And what they did, 
they also have a German marriag
e certificate. They did the sa
me  thing when I was born, but by 
coincidence over there, they did the same  thing -- 

Q: So where did they ma rry? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
15 
 
A: They ma r r ied also on the border, with a German
 document. So they didn™t have to use either 
religion for their marriage certificate. 
Q: So it was a civil ceremony? 

A: Civil ceremony. Lithuania didn™t 
have it. That eliminated changi
ng the religions, either this or 
that, and so we lived happily ever after. 

Q: But let me get back to this a 
little bit. Even if the fa milies we
re not particul arly religious, and 
your parents were not particularly
 li -- religious, you me ntione
d that your patern
al grandmother 
had tried to dissuade your father from ma rrying your mother.  

A: Yes, but his fiancé wa s also Lithuanian. 

Q: Oh, I see. 

A: So that -- that was not an issue of 
religion, that was an issue, don™t drop -- 
Q: I see. 

A: Yeah. 
Q: Don™t drop the first one. 
A: Yeah. Mm-hm. 

Q: And were -- were your pa
rent s accepted by the in-laws?  

A: Absolutely. Absolutely. My fa ther™s --  my grandfather on Father™s side adored my mother. 

Adored. I mean, exactly in the word, adored my
 mother. Mama  helped to put his brothers 
through universities. Mama  took them in. They stay
ed a long time with us. And on Mother™s side 
there was exactly the same  situation. Exactly 
the same  situation. You me ntioned before my 
father™s brother. My mother™s brother found my fa
ther™s brother in Vilnius on the street. That™s 
how we got in touch. So it™s -- it™s a --  they we
re very close. Both fa milies were very close. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
16 
 
Q: I™m a little confused about this incident of 
finding one another on the st
reet. At what year are 
you talking about? 
A: They went 40 -- what is it, 40 -- 40-
some thing?  When he came from Vorkuta. 
Q: Oh, you™re [indecipherable] 

A: Yes, yes. 

Q: Okay, so you™re talking about after the war now -- 

A: After the war, right, yeah. 

Q: -- where they found one another. Let™s st
ill stay in the 1920™s, and did you know your 
maternal grandmother? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Okay. 

A: Yes. 

Q: And so you spent time with your mother™s side of
 the fa mily as well as your father™s side of 
the family? 
A: We ll, my  mother™s side of the family was in Kaunas. 

Q: Ah, okay. 

A: Yeah. It™s only my father 
fa mily who was in Siauliai. 
Q: All right. So you moved fr
om Jurbarkas to Kaunas -- 
A: To Kaunas. 

Q: -- with your father -- 

A: Right. 

Q: -- as he finished his studies. 

A: Right.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
17 
 
Q: All right, so he was -- he was goi
ng to university as you were growing up. 
A: Right. 
Q: Okay. What was -- are there any me mories
 of your childhood with your greater family 
together, with your -- with your grandparents, w
ith your uncles, with your aunts, anything that 
you can ti -- that you remember, that sticks out? 

A: We ll, during the Easter break, my  father™s fa
mily always had a Seder. Even so, the youngest 
uncle couldn™t stop laughing during 
the ceremony, but it was there. 
I reme mber big, big crates of 
ma tzo, silver dishes which were stored from year to year, I reme mber that. 

Q: So you participated? 

A: Oh absolutely. Absolutely. During Christma s,
 I reme mber that thei
r neighbors had all this 
very big Christma s celebration, they were Lithua
nians. So I spent a lot of time for Chr i stma s 
with the neighbors who had childre
n my own age. Otherwise I just
 loved going to Siauliai to be 
pampered by three uncles and grandparents. 
Q: And your uncles were younger?  They we
re all younger brothers of your father? 
A: They were younger brothers. When I was fini
shing attending last years of high school, the 
youngest brother was a student in Belgium. So 
the age difference was not such a shocking one, 
yeah. 
Q: Okay. We ll, thank you, we will go to the --

Q: We ll, it™s unusual. It™s -- it™s unusual what 
you describe, because ther
e is a certain irony, or 
let™s say contradiction. On the one hand, in your 
family, both your very nuclear family of your 
mother and your father, and then the larger, exte
nded fa mily, you say that 
there was a great deal 
of closeness and that the in-laws liked
 the other partner very, very much. 
A: That™s correct . 
Q: But in the larger society, you™re saying you coul
d count on the fingers of -- of both hands how 
ma ny coupl es were in mi xed ma rriages. So how
 do you explain that?  How do you explain th-th-
they got on so well within, but were in 
an environment that was very unlikely? 
A: We ll, there is a -- two words in Lithuani
an terminology. The words are Savanoris-Kurejas. 
These are the people who fought 
for Lithuanian™s independence and put Lithuania on the ma p. 
These people were privileged society. We  had priv
ileges. For example, if I would have chosen to 
go to a high school, free. My conservatory, music, 
was free. My ballet school, state ballet school, 
was free. They were given as ma ny privileges as 
they could. Pa pa was one of the officers™ corps, 
who fought at the f -- with the famous first pulka
s regime nt, probably. They were one for all, all 
for one. 
Q: So he was a Savanoris-Kurejas? 

A: Yes, was Savanoris-Kurejas, absolutely. 

Q: And what is the literal 
translation of those words? 
A: A volunteer -- oh, kurejas is -- 
e -- it doesn™t sound in 
-- in English it doesn™t ma ke any sense. 
Here we understand volunteer arm
y. They -- they were volunteers
. They put their books in high 
school, they went to fight. 

Q: I see. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
19 
 
A: They went to fight for the country. 
Q: Were ther e -- 

A: So he was accepted in the society as one
 of those volunteer fighters for Lithuanian 
independence, without any attachme
nt of religion. And that officer™s
 corps, that solidarity that -- 
with the officers, later on proved ho
w the solidar ity worked between them. 
Q: I see. I see, so that was one of the reas
ons why your -- you were able
 to attend more elite 
schools as you were growing up, as you said, and -- 
and have some  privileges, because of that. 
A: Well, I didn™t use privile
ges for the free high school. 
Q: Okay. 

A: University was free, also. Even so, the ot
her university students
 had to pay. All these 
volunteer fighters had privileges for their family. I 
didn™t use it. I just used
 it for the conservatory 
and for the ballet school, but I 
didn™t use it for the high school, 
and I was too young to use it for 
university. 
Q: How is it that your fa ther ca me  to join the army
 and take part in this 
-- in these battles?  What 
was the ethos, what was the -- the motivation that  propelled hi m?  
A: I think it had to start with hi
s parents. My grandmother Lithua
nian was very strange dialect. 
We don™t talk in towns in that dialect. It™s a dialect -- 

Q: Your Jewish grandmothe
r, you™re talking about? 
A: My Jewish grandmother, yes. In transla
tion we would call it lowlands, Zemaitji, or it™s 
norma lly, in geographical sense, it™s called Samogiti
a. She came  from pa rt of Lithuania closer to 
the Baltic Sea. And naturally we understand them
, but they have a very heavy accent. Which is 
very pretty, by the way. And my grandmother, my 
father™s mother, taught me all old Lithuanian 
songs. All Lithuanian folklore things. It was I go
t from my father™s mother. My mother™s mother, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
20 
 
again, came from St. Petersburg and Riga. She wa
s not so mu ch engrossed in Lithuanian, you 
know, language and so on. Everything I ha
ve, it™s from my father™s mother.  
Q: That™s th -- also unusual. 
A: That™s very unusual, but you see, that™s -- that
™s what it is. I am the product of two -- two lenk 
-- two nationalities, two religions and I 
fit and -- in here, 
and I fit in here. 
Q: We re your grandparents though -- 
outside of your fa mily, your lo -- your nuclear and your 
extended family, did your parents, or did you 
experience any kind of 
prejudice?  Any kind of 
diffi culties?  Anything that made it awkward, that ther e was this Jewish Lithuani an union and that  

you were the child of it. Did they experience anti-Semitism?  

A: They or me ?  

Q: Both. 

A: Neither. Neither. The only first time  in 
1942, I had a very good voice 
and the conductor in 
Vilnius in the symphony -- what we 
had in Vilnius, we had a musi
cal outfit, I -- if I would know 
the name -- anyway, I joined the choi r and the 
conductor was my music teacher in high school, 
and couple of days after we had rehearsals he me
t me  on the street and he said, Ada, don™t come  
any more. I was told who you are. So be careful, and don™t come  in any more. 

Q: And this is during the war -- 

A: That -- that -- during the war. 

Q: When there™s already a ghetto -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- in Vilnius. I see. 

A: Yeah, that was the first time that
 I experienced some body t e lling that. 
Q: But during your growing up years, before the war -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
21 
 
A: Never, never.  
Q: Did it -- when you were with Li thuanians th
ough, not Jewish Lithuanians, but Lithuanians, 

did you hear any kind of -- general kind of anec
dotes or -- or sayings, 
or ways that would 
dimi nish, let™s say, some body who was Jewish? 

A: You know what?  The class of people that
 I attended the school with, was above it. 

Q: I see. So you say it -- it did exist, but 
not in the milieu that -- your circle -- 

A: No. 

Q: -- you were in. 

A: No. 

Q: Okay. Did your parents ever talk about such 
things, about any difficu
lties that they mi ght 
have heard of, or any things that were harder 
for them to take because they were -- they had 
ma de other decisions? 

A: No. Wha t  helped a lot probably, is that Fath
er always worked for Lithuanian institutions, 
[indecipherable] Ministeria, Mini
ster of Justice. And then Li
etukis, the organization -- do you 
know what Lietukis is? 

Q: Tell us. 

A: Okay. It™s an organ -- it™s a association of 
Lithuanian co-ops. It 
was all over the country. 
Every little town, every village had a co-op. And 
that outfit had in their 
hands entire import and 
entire export of the country. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: It just so happened that my father was in the imports of oil, gas and my husband was in the 

other part of lithua -- export fr om Lithuania. It™s 
just a coincidence. So he always worked with 
Lithuania and France, and with -- he
 was always in that atmos phere. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527

Q: There are articles that are now
 appearing in -- in Lithuania that
 explore, for want of a better 
way of putting it, the rise  of anti-Semitism in 
the 1930™s in the country. And a numb er of these 
articles talk about comp -- competition and a co
mpetitive kind of conflict 
of interest between 
organizations such as Lietukis and inde -- 
whether they would be Jewish independent 
[indecipherable] -- 
A: That™s correct . 

Q: -- companies and so on. 

A: Absolutely correct.  

Q: Can you tell us a little bit about that? 

A: I can™t tell you too, too much, but I know that 
my father tried to introduce Lietukis to his 
Jewish -- to the people who had 
business in their hands, people w
ho were Jewish. He was trying 
to explain that this is the c
ountry you™re in, let™s 
move more towards a Lithuanian site, doing 
business with Lithuanians. And you see, this is ag
ain in answer to your qu
estion did he ever feel, 
he was trying to get the --  to get the Jewish me
rchants take mo re me rchandise from Lietukis. He 

was very mu ch against using Russian language in
 Lithuan -- in Jewish society. He was very 
much against. He traveled all ove
r Lithuania during the fin -- Finnish
 Soviet war, giving lectures 
-- 

Q: In 1939. 

A: -- right, giving lectures about the [indecipherable] Mannerheim™ s fight with the Soviets. And 

from his side, he didn™t see himself as a Jew, he
 saw hims elf as a Lithua
nian patriot, when you 
[indecipherable] those people. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
23 
 
Q: And did he talk about what 
kind of reaction this type -- thes
e efforts were having?  Did he 
make headroad? Were there -- were there some of
 his Jewish colleagues or
 friends who were not 
part of Lietukis who accepted it, or did 
he talk about what his experiences were? 
A: We ll, it wasn™t easy to persuade. You know, the 
me rchant is a me rchant and they have their 
local how do you -- how would say it, local ways
. But he managed, he ma naged to pull quite a 
few to buy from Lietukis. That what it was, buy fr
om Lietukis. My father was an expert, he 
published a book which Mama  was a fraid to -- to 
keep around when the Soviets came, about the 
all kind of me rchandise in connection with oils a
nd gas. Everything connect 
-- in connection with 
that area. And that was his last work, absolutely. 
So that™s -- that™s all 
I can tell you. And he was 
the only Jewish person in the entire 
country in Lietukis, the only one.  

Q: And why would you think that was? 

A: Because nobody regarded him as a Jew. 

Q: So if they ha-had rega rded him as a Jew, he wouldn™t ha ve been accepted? 
A: But he wa -- he was a Jew -- 
Q: I know. 

A: -- everybody knew it. But nobody -- nobody regarded him as a Jew. 

Q: What I mean to say is if th
ere had been some body else who ha
d been Jewish and did not have 
the same , let™s say, point of view as your -- your fa
ther, but had wanted to 
be part of Lietukis, 
would they have gotten such acceptance? 

A: No. 

Q: And the reason being? 

A: Because he was a Jew. 

Q: So there was anti-Semitism 
in the country, and quite -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
24 
 
A: Officially no. Officially no, but
 in the -- in -- for example,
 my father™s next brothers, 
Salomonis, Solomon, he  was the only person inLietuvos bankas, the bank of Lithuania. Again, 
another example. So you could get through, if 
you were accepted by Lithuanian community as 
one of ours. Not as a Russian talking Jewish
 person, which was the style of our Jewish 
population. That™s why it was so 
difficult to s-save  some ti me s, children, because they spoke 
Russian and they spoke Yiddish a
nd they didn™t speak Lithuanian. 
That wa s a tragedy that really 
was an -- a very important factor. Ma
ny children could ha-have been saved. 
Q: You™re talking now about the war. 

A: Yeah. Yeah. 

Q: About the -- the ghetto and the Holocaust. Let 
me go back a little bit again to World War I 
just for a question. Your father joined the -- th
e military and fought for Lithuani an independence. 
Were there other Jewish
 people that you knew -- 
A: Yes. 
Q: -- Jewish me n that you knew -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- who did the same? 

A: Yes. There was -- I don™t know
 the number, but I reme mb er during the parades with -- when 
we used to ha ve big military para des, it was suba --  [speaks Lithuanian here ] 

Q: [indecipherable] 

A: Like I see in my -- you know, I saw a film in 
United States and my father was in that film, 
too. I see the -- I would ca -- probably say about
 -- about a hundred, they
 were all fighters for 
Lithuanian freedom. 

Q: So this [speaks Lithuanian] would be translated as a Jewish -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
25 
 
A: The Jewish volunteers -- 
Q: -- volunteers -- 

A: -- for Lithuanian independence. Were Je
wish fighters. Jewish
 fighter, volunteers for 
Lithuanian independence.  

Q: And there were at least a hundred people -- 

A: I -- I see -- I see the parade 
in -- I see in my eyes, yeah.  
Q: And that was a -- 

A: It coul d ha ve been mo re because the parades 
was always in Kaunas and there -- others in the 
other villages in other towns w
ho probably -- not always used to come  to Kaunas. But there was 
quite a few. 

Q: I™m -- I mention this because the -- one of the 
charges of -- of Lithuani ans against the Jewish 

community is that the Jewish community in L
ithuania sided with the Soviets when 1940 came 
around. That™s the charge. And I reme mber talking 
to a number of survivors who would say there 
were people who fought for Lithuania™s independ
ence, and that was not acknowledged, as they 
were being driven to the pits to be shot. Is that
 sort of experience, that
 -- can you address that at 
all? 

A: In life there are two groups of people. Ther
e are richer people, th
ere are factory working 
element. We ll, you cannot deny it, you have pi
ctures, you see who stood in our ma in street 
accepting Soviet army. You see the pictur es, you don™
t have to be told. The people with red flags 

standing and greeting Soviet army 
were the element -- factory element. Jewish factory element. 
The people -- the richer element, in percentage, 
wa s deported to Siberia -- higher percentage than 
Lithuanians. I don™t mean number, I mean percen
tage. So now you adjust these two factors. No 
intelligent class was willing to 
huh, Soviets are here. That was not
 the case. The factory class, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
26 
 
yes. What reme mbered in people™s me mories are 
the red flags and who are the red flags. Only 
they, when those people stood with red flags, my  fa
ther, Mama  and I, we a
ll worked -- walked to 
[speaks Lithuanian] 

Q: The War Museum. 

A: The War Museum. 

Q: In Kaunas, mm-hm. 

A: Where for the last time -- I don™t know if you™re fa miliar, every evening the invalids came 

from the building, they paraded through the 
grounds and there was a ceremony. Whoever came 
to that, that day to the place, we were singi
ng the Lithuanian nationa
l -- national anthem, 
everybody was crying. It was unbelievably mova 
-- m- moving scene. So you see, you can™t 
blame the -- you can™t blame the whole Jewish
 nation, same  way you cannot blame the whole 
Lithuanian nation for what happened.  

Q: It is a bitter mo me nt though, for those who w
ould have been volunteers. It™s a bitter mo me nt 
for everybody, but in particular the people who 
had volunteered for Lithua
nia™s independence to 
then be called traitors and not 
have that counted at all.  
A: I don™t know if you want to ma ke a -- 
okay. Attorney Gorni
onskis from Kaunas -- 
Q: Mm-h m, mm-h m.  

A: -- was one of those. When the Soviets cam
e, he took his f-fa mily, mo ved to Vilnius. 
Q: He was a Jewish volunt
eer for the [indecipherable] 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: I™ll tell you very quickly, because we are t
oo fa r away. Wh en the Lithua nian hapunes -- 
Q: Who would this be? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
27 
 
A: You had to be Lithuanian in those days. 
Hapune come  from a word hapun. Hapun is to grab. 
They were called in Jewish language, hapunes. Th
ese were the Lithuanian
s with the white -- 
Q: Ar mbands? 
A: Ar mbands. 

Q: Balta raiıt
³
. 
A: Balta raiıt
³
. Came to his apartment and a Lithuanian offi cer was living in the same apartment 
and Lithuanian officer told him -- he was active offi
cer in Lithuanian army  
at th -- th -- in those 
days, is that Mr. Gornionski, do not answer the 
door. They see my na me  on the door, don™t even 
come  close to the door. And whatever, hide in my
 room and lock the door. Don™t even leave my 
room. When the hapunes came to the apartment, Mr
. Gornionski put his wife and two children in 
the Lithuanian army officer™s room, and Gornio
nski said, oh for God™s sake, I am the volunteer 

with Savanoris-Kurejas, they are not going to do 
any harm to me . So he opened the door and his 
appearance was extremely Jewish. You couldn™t 
take him for anybody else. And the Lithuanians 
taunted, oh come  on, you such and such. So he 
said to him, l ook, I am a volunteer fighter. I 
fought for your country™s independence. That™s 
why you have a country today, because of people 
like me . And that ma de the ma n wild. He started to
 beat hi m there, to the pulp. So that was the 
reaction between one and the othe
r. Now, how do I know all about it, is because of some thing 
very similar happened in our place. My father sa
id to Mama , please go to see what happened to 
Gornionski. Because there was an aktion when those -- when -- 

Q: So this was in 1941? 

A: ™41, yes.  

Q: Right when the Nazis are inva ding -- 

A: Right, yes. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
28 
 
Q: -- during those first weeks. 
A: Yes, yes. 

Q: And this is what happens to
 -- and did he die, Mr. -- 
A: We ll, I™ll tell you what happened. So at -- 
Mama  went and Mrs. Gornionski opened the door 
and she told Mama  what happened because she 
could hear everything, 
even though they were 
locked in the room. Ma ma  ran to Lithuanian 
mi litary comma ndantura, Lithuanian mi litary 
headquarters. And Gornionskis had very, very 
good friend, Songila -- I have to reme mber the 
name . I think Majora Songila, if I™m not wrong. 
Songila -- whatever he was doing, he dropped 
everything, he ran to Lukiık
¡
s jail, where everybody was taking, to Lukiık
¡
s. He went all over 
through the hundreds of people that
 were already brought and he 
was screaming, Gor nionskis, 
Gornionskis, Gornionskis until he couldn™t scream
 any more. He couldn™t fi nd him. So whether 
from be -- being beaten so badl
y he just passed out, or whethe
r he was so overcome with what 
happened to him that he didn™t react,
 Major Songila couldn™t fi nd him.  
Q: So he died. 
A: We  don™t know -- well -- well, naturally he 
died. Naturally they -- everything from the 
Lukiık
¡
s was taken to Paneriai and shot. 
Q: That™s a bitter mo me nt.  

A: It is a bitter mo me nt, but 
you see there™s again an explanati
on to -- to all of
 that certain 
explanation. This was about tw
o -- two -- two, three weeks after 
deportations to Si beria. Now, 
you™re too young to reme mber. I reme mber. Deporta
tions to Siberia bro
ught a lot of anger. 
Q: But why should it be directed
 against the country™s Jews? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
29 
 
A: The red flags of the people on the alley of 
liberty, [Lithuanian]. Pe
ople don™t forget things 
like that. People who worked in personnel depart
ments of each institution, kadroskidos, they 
were in the hands of
 certain nationality. 
Q: So you -- 
A: All that added up to the outburst of hatre
d. They didn™t look at the time, were you pro or 
contra, it just mass, the whole ma
ss was experiencing that hatred.  

Q: How is it that your parents di
dn™t, or your fami ly didn™t?  You fa
ther didn™t, or his -- his uncles 
-- or did they? 

A: How -- how did we -- what do you mean? 

Q: Make it through those first few weeks. 

A: Well, that  was all [i ndeciphera
ble] officer™s help. See, the -- 
I -- I tol --  I mentioned that, it 
probably belonged to that famous first regime nt. 
The closeness of the officers was unbelievable. 
When the Soviets came in 1914, Papa was the firs
t person from Lietukis thrown out of job. Not 
only thrown out of job, but not gi
ven right to live in 
Kaunas, and not given 
right -- not given the 
labor book. So for awhile we couldn™t understand
 what™s going on. We  never had anything to do 

with the Soviet Union. But after a few days, people started to see what™s going on. So Mama  said 

to my father, you know what?  Go to Vilnius. Hi
s brother, who was bor 
-- working in Bank of 
Lithuania in the meantime was transferred from Siau
liai to Vilnius, so she said, go to Vilnius -- 
Q: This is brother who -- which was -- 

A: Salomoni s. 

Q: Salomon. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
30 
 
A: Yeah. Solomon. And he went to Vilnius. He tr
ied to get a job in Vilnius. Whenever he would 
put his name  and go through Kadroz Kiduz, that o
ffice of political personnel, he couldn™t get the 
job. 

Q: Why?  

A: Why?  First of all, he was an officer. Sec
ondly, he went all over 
Lithuania talking, giving 
speeches against Soviet Union. 

Q: In the Finnish German -- 

A:  In t h e fi nni  -- fi  -- fi  -- 

Q: -- in the Finnish Soviet war. 

A: -- Soviet  war. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And secondly he was not a class that they wa
nt to have. In those 
days, when you opened our 
ma in newspaper, on two pages were hundreds an
d hundreds Lithuanian army personnel out of 
work, out of work, out of work. The y 
would tell all thes
e officers are out.  
Q: Which newspaper was this? 

A: That was still the first days [indecipherable]Aidas, but then it change already to different 

name s. But they gave a list of, in alphabetical or
de r of each and every officer that used to serve 
in Lithuanian army. 

Q: So that means during the Soviet time , that 
is in 1940, this echo of Lithuania newspaper was 

still being published. 

A: From the  beginning. From the 
beginning it was published, but then they changed the name s, 

yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
31 
 
Q: I see. My point though, is I™m trying to unders
tand is that even with the Soviet takeover, a 
newspaper that was not Soviet 
controlled was allowed to be published and allowed to have the 
name s of people who were unemployed listed ther
e. That™s unusual, 
if I™m understanding it 
correctly. 
A: The -- they knew we -- what -- 
don™t forget there was a -- a -- the -- they for med a Lithuanian 
pro-Soviet governme nt. So the governme nt had no choi
ce. If they were told 
that all the officers™ 
corps has to be out of the army, they had to do 
it. So that™s where the -- all the officers were 
listed. If there exists a fi -- some where you know, 
in archives, the newspapers from that area, 
you™ll find it. So you say how come . So anyway, toma ke a long story short, Father couldn™t get 

work in Vilnius. It happened that he me t one
 of t he people from his fighting years who was a 
head of health departme nt in Vilnius. Pulkanik
as Colonel Usas. Usas saw him on the street and 
say hey, what are you doing here in Vilnius, you™re
 in Kaunas. So my fat her explained to him 
that yes, I am in Kaunas, my fa mily is in Kauna
s, but I can™t -- I don™t 
have right to work in 
Kaunas and I don™t have right to re
gister in Kaunas to live. So I 
came to Vilnius to see maybe I 
can do some thing in he re. So Colonel Usas told him look, we™ll do some thing different. I will not 

put you through that political pers
onnel department. I will hire 
you as chief accountant and you™ll 
be listed as a daily worker, a laborer, so you don™
t have to go through the 
political process. And 
Mr. Usas kept my father, as he said, in the hea
lth departme nt, protected him as much as he could. 
And when the Germans came in Vilnius, the regu
lation that no Jew is allowed to work for a 
governme nt office came not imme diately. So, ever
y morning, when Jews were already wearing 

the white -- not -- not yello
w stars yet, the white armband, white and blue -- 
Q: Jews were wearing a 
white and --  white -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
32 
 
A: Yes, white and blue armband -- armband. So Ma
ma used to take my father to the health 
department --

Q: Okay, so your father was working in the health 
departme nt in Vilnius, i-
in -- in the -- what is 
the capital city now. 
A: Right. 

Q: The Germans arrive and hi
s protector, whose name  was? 
A: Pulkanikas Colonel Usas. 

Q: Usas. 

A: U-s-a-s. 

Q: Okay, experiences some  sort of difficulties or
 pressure. Can you tell us
 about what happened?  
A: Which one of them?  My father™s e
xperiences -- pressure, or Colonel Usas? 
Q: Well, isn™ t it that  ker --  

A: They had -- 

Q: -- whoeve r -- whoever is -- 
A: -- okay. 
Q: -- yeah, what happened? 

A: That was a law. It was a law advertised on 
every pole, on every telephone pole, and not only 
on the poles, we used to have such a -- that stru
cture, on every couple of cor -- ca -- corners of 
the street, where you would announce concerts, 
operas and so on. Everywhere was the new 
regulation issued by the -- sign
ed by the new Lithuanian govern
me nt, that no more Jewish 
extraction people are allowed to work for a stat
e institution. That was 
a law. And Us as had no 
way to keep him any longer. He kept him up til that time . 

Q: And this is in June or July of 1941? 

A: That™s right, that™s right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
34 
 
Q: And so it™s -- if 
it™s issued by the Lithua
nian governme nt, do you mean the Lithuanian 
provisional governme nt? 
A: Provisional governme nt. 

Q: So it™s a provisional governme nt di
rective, not a German directive? 
A: It was -- you know, it™s difficu
lt to tell today, because there 
was regulations put out by the 
German military headquarters, by Germans. We 
used to call Gebiets commi ssar, the ca -- 
Q: Regional commissioner. 

A: Regional co-commi ssioner for Baltic countries
. I can™t tell you exactly now which one is 
which, but anyway, Usas or -- Colonel Usas told my 
father that the only thing I can think what to 

do in this situation, I™ll appoint you 
as a director of the Jewish hosp
ital. At least you™ll be safe for 
awhile as a direct or of hospital because, he said
, I believe the Germans will not shut the hospital. 

They are -- they will be afraid of epidemics, 
typhoid or whatever, so you should be safe in the 
hospital. And -- my father never had anything to 
do with hospital or anything, but he said well, 
this is the only thing I can do at
 the time being, unless you want to 
go into the hiding. And at that 
time my father said he is not th
inking about hiding. He™ll go with hi
s entire fa mily, which at that 
time was quite a fe w in Vilnius, he™ll go and take  
the position of director of the hospital. And he 
stayed in the hospital for quite awhile.  

Q: Now at this point, I™d like 
to leave that for a moment. 
A: Mm-h m.  

Q: I have a question about Colonel 
Usas and -- and it™s one that™s -- 
that it bi -- sort of like rouses 
my curiosity. Here is some body who was a -- let™
s say a comr ade of your father™s from the 
officer corps of the Lithuanian independent arm
y, who survives, let™s say, a Soviet purge. In 
other words, his is not one of 
the names that™s on the list of those who are unemployed, who ends 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
35 
 
up in Vilnius during the S
oviet rule and is able to offer your
 fa ther protection. And then lasts 
long enough to still hold that 
post when the German come  -- Germans come  in. How is that 
possible with a person of such a ba
ckground, to be able to do this? 
A: First of all, he was a doc
tor [speaks Lithuanian here] 
Q: Ear -- ear, no -- 
A: A -- he was a doctor ear, nose and throat. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: So he was not just an admi nistrative person, 
he was a doctor. So when the Soviets had those 
lists of officers out of the army, he was proba
bly not in the regular army, he was a doctor. 
Q: Okay. 

A: He was a doctor. A political person, a doctor.
 So that™s how he ma naged to do it. Now, you 
want me  to continue in which direction? 

Q: Okay, I would say let™s go back to the 1930™s -- 
A: Mm-h m.  
Q: -- a little bit. We  were -- we were talki
ng earlier about your larger
 extended fa mily, about 
your father™s work at Lietukis, wh
ich was a cooperative association.  
A: There™s one thing I forgot to me ntion. 

Q: Okay. 

A: We had a paramilitary organization called Sauliai. 

Q: Okay. 

A: Not Siauliai, but Sauliai, s-a-u. 

Q: What does that translate as? 

A: Para -- nothing. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
36 
 
Q: Oh, para -- 
A: Paramilitary organi zation. And my father wa
s one of the leaders of that paramilitary 
organization. The me mbers wore a uniform si milar to army uniform.  

Q: Wa s it like a national guard? 

A: Something like national guard. The problem is that it was a very patriotic paramilitary 

organization which unfortunately, when the Germ
ans came got a very bad review. It wasn™t 
before. 

Q: Did it -- was it a deserved review?  
What did they do?  How did they -- 
A: Kill the Jews. 

Q: We ll, let™s -- what did they do, yeah. 

A: Killed the Jews. 

Q: Oh, they killed the Jews. 

A: Mm-hm. But, I haven™ t seen, and I don™t know, 
but this is, if you will look into whatever is 
written, you will find. So you see, Father was a head
 of that organization 
in ma ny places. So the 
Soviets couldn™t digest him. Plus he™s going all 
over the country, talking 
about the Finnish war. 
And he was known. Father was a me mber of Jewish
 -- a Revisionistic orga
nization called Brit 
ha-Hayal. 

Q: What is that?  Te
ll us about that. 
A: The -- the Jewish people have Zionistic 
and Re visionistic. This
 was a Revisionistic 
organization. 

Q: Was it not for patriation to Palest ine? Was it --  

A: Zionistic organizations were mo
re for patriation to Palestine. 
Revisionistic were also s-same , 
but the ideologic -- ideol
ogy was different. And -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
37 
 
Q: How was  it different? 
A: I was too young to tell you about the differenc
e. I think they were more supporting bik -- 
Revisionistic move me nt  was move ment for the 
richer people. Zionistic moveme nt wa s more 
move me nt of working class. I must have been 
around four or five ye
ars old and my father 
organized a military camp for me mbers of the Brit 
ha-Hayal. He always fe lt that Je wish people 
don™t have that military drive, let™s do it and th
ere was a big camp organized, and in that camp I 
learned a lot of Hebrew songs, which I happen to
 reme mber today. And th-they were pro-Israel, 
but I don™t know how they are [inde
cipherable] at that time . See, 
Israel at that time was British. 
So they tried to use pressure someho
w to get it out of British clutches.  
Q: Did you visit him at that camp? 

A: I was in the camp, M a ma  and I, we was -- we were in the camp. Yea h, no-no -- no other 

fa milies, just  Mama and I. 

Q: And wha t  do you reme mber from it? 
A: What I reme mber, I reme mber 
morning drills that they had, 
ma rching like army. You tried to 
induce the -- you know, it™s always b
een said the Jewish people are 
so often this and that, and he 
said it just the contrary, but you have to gi
ve them an out, some where how to do it, see. 
Q: Mm-hm. So, training. 
A: Training.  

Q: And was it -- was it well attended? 

A: Oh yes. They lived in there a -- for a month. 

Q: And how ma ny people do you think were ther
e?  Do you -- would you rec -- what was it, a 
couple of hundred?  Wa s it fewer, was it more? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
38 
 
A: I-I wouldn™t say couple of hundred. You see, i 
-- in my me mory I see them lined -- lined up 
for the morning revai and so on. 
I couldn™t tell you how ma ny th
ey had, but there was quite -- 
quite a group. Quite a group. 
Q: And this had nothing to do with 
the Lithuani an military at al l? 
A: No, no, nothing.  

Q: And the idea of it was that it would be a pr -- 
a force that would be part of the move me nt to 
Israel, the moveme nt to be 
able to establish Israel? 
A: You can™t establish Israel in
 those days. You can™t think about
 establishing, because it was in 
British clut ch. 

Q: Yes. 

A: It was Palestine. But they did work toward
s it, which -- which -- I don™t know how they did it. 
Q: Did you know ma ny of the other 
people who were at -- like -- 
A: Who wer e  in the camp? 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Yes I did, but you see, I was four or five years old. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: I reme mb er they had in our town, in Kaunas was Mr. Dushnitsky and Pa pa was under Mr. 

Dushnitsky. 

Q: I see. 

A: So yi -- one was a leader, he was an assist
ant. And I reme mber that
 after the camp they 
needed a worker in Lithuanian embassy. And th
ere were two people as 
candidates. One was my 
father and another was, I can™t reme mber now his 
last name . So anyway, he got that position in 

that Lithuani an embassy in Palestine. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
39 
 
Q: Oh, so there was a representa
tion of Lithuani
a in Palestine? 
A: Yeah, there was, there was, yeah. 
Q: And so the other person got that -- 

A: The other person got the job, yeah. That -- wh
at -- you see, I was too small to reme mber too 
much about [indecipherable] 

Q: What languages did you speak at home ?  What was your language between your father, your 

mother and yourself? 

A: Just Lithuanian.  

Q: Just Lithuanian. 

A: Just Lithuanian. 

Q: And were other languages 
some times spoken in your house? 
A: Oh yes. A lot of ad -- parents had a lot of 
friends from the army who were officers from the 
Russian Tsaristic army, incorpor
ated into Lithuanian army. 
Q: Okay, so for mer Tsarist officers -- 

A: Former Tsarist officers, right. And he had the 
very, very, very clo -- 
I -- I would say probably 
the closest friends. Now let me  see. It was Kan
az LaPotion, Kanaz -- what -- what we called him 
in -- in English. [speaks Lithuanian] 

Q: Ah, Grand Duke. 

A: Gran -- Duke. 

Q: Grand Duke, yes. 

A: Duke LaPotion, yeah. But when LaPotions we
re visiting us, they 
always spoke Russian. 
Q: I see. 

A: Because their Lithuani an was good, but not so good. His was good, his wife™s not so much. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
40 
 
Q: So this was part of, let™s say, the ri -- White Russian -- 
A: White, white Tsar istic -- 

Q: -- Russian refugees who had -- 

A: -- refuges, right, right. 

Q: -- who had come  from Soviet -- 

A: Now Mrs. -- Mr. LaPotion™s brother, Kellanos
 Shablavinskas was the -- was attached to our 
president of Lithuania. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: So this was our group, th-the LaPotions, the 
Shablavinska, but they, 
because of the w-wome n, 
who don™t learn so quick -- the me n had to learn 
the language, but the wome n didn™t, they spoke 
Russian. 

Q: I see. 

A: But otherwise I never heard Russian in the house. 
Q: But your mother spoke Russian, so it was -- 
A: Oh, she pa -- she 
spoke perfect Russian. 
Q: And whe n did you learn it? 

A: You know, I cannot answer the 
question. I some ti me s think to myself, when and where did I 
pick up the language?  We used to spend summer s around Kulautuva. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: But a lot of Jewish families used to stay in summer -- 

Q: Where isKulautuva? 

A: Kulautuva is past -- on the river Ne munas, pas t  Kaunas. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
41 
 
A: Not far away. I imagine those children must 
have talked Russian, I must have picked it up 
there. But, in 1940, when the Russians came in, 
I was graduating and they pushed us to learn 
Russian in that one year. They expected us to
 pick it up. We  didn™t know the alphabet, we didn™t 
know how to write Russian letters, 
but we were given ins-instruc
tions every day. We  sat in high 
school til seven o™clock at night. They had -- 
Q: You were how old then? 

A: 14.  

Q: 14. And so you hadn™t -- your knowledge of Ru
ssian to that point had been in verbal 
conversation rather than -- 

A: Just verbal, but not during my growing y
ears, I didn™t have a
nyone to talk Russian. 
Q: Okay, so it was not -- 

A: Yeah -- 

Q: -- there was no academic for mal background -- 
A: No, no, no, not at all. 
Q: -- there was no -- all of a sudden you have a crash course. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Before we get back to 1940 I wanted to, you k
now, talk a little bit more about those 1930™s. 

Did you have -- when you were growing up, 
who were your closest friends your age? 
A: My age? 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: The -- the closest friend was the daughter of our 
mi nister -- mi nister what int -- in-interior. 
Sku
as, [indecipherable] Sku
as. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
42 
 
A: That was my closest fr iend. 
Q: So it would be his daughter. 

A: [indecipherab
le] his daughter. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: When the Russians came  in, Sku
as took his wife and da
ughter to the border. 
Q: Of?  

A: Lithuania and Germa ny. They let his wife
 and daughter across, the Li thuanian guards 
wouldn™t let [indecipherable] Sku
as across. He was in the ultimatum where the Russians put the 
ultimatum t o our government. They said that they want to have arrested Mr. Sku
as and Mr. 
Povilaitis, both from Mi nistry of
 Interior. So they took Mr. Sku
as back, he was arrested. When I 
met Mrs. Sku
as in Florida, she asked me , Ada, do 
some thing, try to find out. Maybe some  
Jewish people sat with him some where. Maybe
 anybody knows, whatever there is, we  have no 

idea what happened to him. We  are read in th
e paper that he was finished, but no details, no 
place of burial. And I told her, Mrs. Sku
as, I say, we have the same  problem in our house. We  
don™t know exact date, we don™t know where, we 
have no burial and we have no place where he  
is, you know, sa me  thing. So I symp athize with her as much as, you know, because she went 

exactly what my mother went throug
h. And that was my closest friend. 
Q: I see. I see. Did you have friends w
ho were part of the Jewi sh community? 
A: Yes. They lived not too far from us, and we 
were friends since probab
ly the age of four or 
five. We  played together -- we 
played together with her. For 
some reason I renamed her Lucia. 
Her name  was Judith. I never liked the Judith 
name, I renamed her Lucia, so that even her 
parents, when I was there, called her Lucia. And -- 

Q: What language did you speak? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
43 
 
A: Lithuanian. 
Q: I see. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: So they were also more assimilated. 

A: Nope, very Jewish.  

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Very Jewish, very Jewish. And that™s a house
 where I heard a lot of Jewish language. Her 
mother was very famous . She had an atelier. Seam -- seamstress. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: She had ma ny workers in the atelier, and thos
e workers gradually went to Palestine. They 
used to get the landing permits some how through 
the zionis -- Zionist organization, and they 
went to Palestine. So Lucia, I 
lost track of her when the Soviet
s came. And then again, after the 
liberation, I me t her in a theater. It was a very difficult mo me nt, and for her and for me. 
Q: Why?  
A: Well, she lost her father, I lost my father. I 
had no idea that she™s alive,
 she had no idea that I 
am alive. It -- it was a -- very difficult for me
. But  anyway -- so otherwise I didn™t have Jewish 
friends, no. But she had to be -- she was in an 
e -- two houses away, so we always played 
together. That™s the only -- but otherwise in
 the Jewish society, no, it didn™t happen. 

Q: Did you hear some  of your other pl
ayma tes at school ma ke fun of Jews? 
A: No. 

Q: Di -- no. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
44 
 
A: Nothing. Not -- not in that class of people. 
We  were -- I™ll show you the pictures. We had a 
very large nu mber of Jewish students who excelle
d, so that from the side of teachers you would 
never hear anything li
ke that, never.  
Q: So this is at that elit
e high school that you went -- 
A: Elite hi gh school, right. 

Q: -- that you went to. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: I see. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: And of c ourse if you have a larger number 
of kids who are Jewish
 then it™s unlikely -- 
A: Unlikely. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Yeah. 
Q: Yeah. What were -- you know, as the 1930™
s were progressing, you were getting ol der and 
older, from childhood into young teenager. 

A: Right. 

Q: What are your me mo ries from that time?  A -- 

A: Wonderful. 

Q: In what way? 

A: Wonderful in every way. In every way. 
I -- I was playing piano. I entered Kaunas 
Conservatory. I was very skinny, so my parents deci
ded that I need more muscles, so they put me  

in the ballet school. But our ballet
 school does not compare to Amer
ican ballet school. Six days a 
week, every day, just Sunday off. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
45 
 
Q: Oh my. 
A: That was a state ballet school. So, between ba
llet and conservatory 
and sports, I had no time 
to be bored or anything. I had a wonderful time, 
and I was very good in sports also. I loved to 
ski. I have a silver  medal in Lithuani an ski competitions in the senior gr oup -- 

Q: Where there are mountains? 

A: Yes -- not with mountains, cross country. 

Q: Uh-huh, okay. 

A: Cross country s -- right. And I was good runner
. So can you imagine having all this and to do 
the music lessons at home ?  The high school lessons didn™t bother me , I was very good at that, 

but the music, you had to do it. So there was no 
free time. I had the wonderful time, wonderful 
fr iends. The skating rink, all they had to do was 
run down the hill to backyard into the skating 
rink. I have plenty of pictures
 from skating rink with all my
 friends. And since I was the 
youngest, I always was the smallest
 one, but that didn™t ma tter. 
Q: When did world events, particularly those events in Germany start entering your 

consciousness?  Did peop -- you know -- 

A: Never. 

Q: Never. 

A: Never. Some  of my mother™s friends -- and 
my mo- mo- mother™s and father friends went to 
America cause they had t -- families in America, 
but they went only when the Soviets came, via 
Japanese help, you know, the Japanese consul? 

Q: Yes. 

A: Yes, with his help, they we
nt. We  heard a lot of what was going in Germany because we used 
to spend summer in Palanga, and in the late part 
of 30™s, the German -- Germans used to come to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
46 
 
Palanga and they used to tell us more or le
ss what™s going on. But we 
never thought it concerns 
us. We  never thought that Hitl
er one day will take Klaip
¡
da and so on and so on. 
Q: Do you reme mber when that happened?  Whe n he did take Klaip
¡
da? 
A: What was it, 30 -- 
Q: [indecipherable] 

A: Okay, it started with the big -- big case of 
Sass and Neuman. Lithuania caught the spies Sass 
and Neuman and put them on trial. 

Q: Whose spies were they? 

A: Germany . 

Q: They were German spies in Lithuania? 

A: German s pies in Lithuania. They were put on tr
ial and I think since that  trial, the atmosphere 
between Germany and Li thuania started to get wors
e and worse. And then one day Hitler put an 
ultimatum and that™s when all the Lithuanian
s ran out fr om hi -- ”emaitija, fr om Klaip
¡
da 
region, to Kaunas. 

Q: So, from the Memel region, Memel is Klaip
¡
da  - - 
A: Mem -- Klaip
¡
da, in German [indecipherable] yeah. 
Q: -- in German, uh-huh. And -- and so there was an exodus? 

A: Exodus. 

Q: I see. 

A: Absolute -- absolute exodus. 

Q: Did you know any of these people? 

A: Oh yes, oh yes, they entered our high school
s, they entered our society and everything. 
Q: Did they talk about what they ha d experienced? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
47 
 
A: They didn™t experience anything, th
ey just ran. It was an exodus to run. 
Q: Oh I see, so they lost  their --  
A: They left -- 

Q: -- they left  their hom
es, they lost their -- 
A: -- yes, they left everything. Bu
t it still didn™t give us even 
th -- if you talk to the German 
population, ma ny of them say they didn™t know
 a lot. We  didn™t know a lot either.  
Q: Right. 

A: Nobody thought that a civilized na tion like Ge rman
 nation will be able to do atrocities of the 
kind that they did. 

Q: When you would meet people 
from Ger many in the resort to
wn, in Palanga by the ocean in 
the summer times, and they say they were
 talking about what 
was going on there -- 
A: You know what was the ma in talking? 

Q: -- do you reme mber what they say -- what? 
A: Food. 
Q: I see. 

A: We  have no butter. You have shortage of this
, this and that. That was their ma in thing comi ng 
to Palanga.  

Q: Really? 

A: They never me ntioned political pressure, see?  
So we had no idea. We  -- we knew that it™s not 
as good as it used to be before, but our Jewish pe
ople still kept going to 
Germany for trade. The 
visas were open, you could go in and back. So 
you see we didn™t -- we didn™t know. There is a 
book by a Lithuanian writer, [indecipherable]  

Q: Mm-h m.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
48 
 
A: I have the book. In that book she describe
s the survival of two Jewish girls. 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: And whe n I was reading that book I figured, 
uh-oh, I think I know who she is. She was in my 
school. Her father had factory, I know the name
. And some how, when I was vacationing in 
Maine, I came  to talk about the book with one of
 Lithuanian singers from Canada, and -- Kabliss. 
And he said, oh you™re right, that™s her. But she 
doesn™t have -- she has no
thing to do with people 
from that times. And just why, 
what™s wrong?  I -- he said, I don™
t know, but she doesn™t want to 
know anybody, she only keeps in touch with the fa m
ily who s a ved her. So, why did we come  to 
this now, I can™t understand. 

Q: I don™t reme mber, but it was some thing to do -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- with the -- with 
what you know what -- 
A: Oh, oh. Her father -- she was attending ballet
 school with me , and I reme mber her father 
going to Germany and I reme mber her father brin
ging her beautiful, black shoes. And th-that™s 
why I reme mber [indecipherable]. Her father kept
 going to Ge rmany back and forth in business. 
He had the big stocking factory. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And he just went and came back. Nothing -- no
thing to -- so that™s wa
y -- when you say that, 
did we know?  No, we didn™t know. 

Q: No sort of premonition? 

A: No, no. 

Q: And now let™s go east. When did 
you get a sense of Soviet Russia? 
A: When they entered. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
49 
 
Q: And not before. 
A: No. Before, I used to st
ay very often with the Sku
as family, and I remember once at the 
dinner, he had the conversation with his wife, the 
Russians started to tell us
 that couple of Soviet 
soldiers have disappeared. And he
 said it -- it™s an awful provocation. But in those days he didn™t 
think that it™ll come -- that™ll be a reason for th
e Russians to tell that they are comi ng to liber ate 
Lithuania. 

Q: So the provocation is on whose side?  Th
e Russians are provoking the Lithuanians? 
A: Right. That we did some thing to a couple of th
eir soldiers and the sold
iers disappeared, as if. 
Q: I see. 

A: See, that was -- that was the beginning. 

Q: And that™s the first premonition you have -- 

A: That is pre-premonition that there™s some  -- 
and then they introduced -- no, they introduced 
Soviet bases, basi, bases for Russian soldiers. Th
ey were not going out of the way, so they stayed 
on the base. And that™s when they said that coup
le of soldiers disappeared from the base and 
never returned. And that was a ma
in thing, as if, to liberate us. 
Q: And how did you -- how did -- well, we™ll come  
to that in a little bit, but ho -- you were by 
that point 13 - 14 years old. 

A: 14. 

Q: So I™d like to get a sense of what do you re
me mber, what do you experience. How did it affect 
you in particular? 

A: Oh yeah, I™ll tell you.  

Q: But it can be in the next tape. 

A: Okay. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527

Q: Okay. 
End of Tape Three

Beginning Ta pe Four 
Q: Okay, so what ha -- a-after you reme mber this
 dinner conversation with the mi nistry interiors 
talking about the strange situa
tion of the Soviet Union saying 
their soldiers have gone mi ssing 
here, and then bases are establis
hed within the territo
ry, what was your next me mory of what 
happened with independent Lithuania 
or life as you knew it, basically. 
A: Nothing until they crossed the border and ma rched into Li thuanian territory. Nothing. 
Q: And do you reme mbe r  that? 

A: Oh perfectly. 

Q: What happened, how -- what did you see?  What 
is what -- what™s in your mi nds -- mi nd™s 
eye? 

A: The -- the Russian army, on little horses. Most of the riders slanted eyed, was the 

[indecipherable] nation -- 

Q: Mm-h m, mm-h m.  
A: -- ma rching through our Avenue of Liberty in 
Kaunas, straight. And that™s when I told you 
Papa took me and my mother to the Museum of Wa
r, and we spent with a crowd of people there. 
We couldn™t stand any more that pressure, 
watching the Soviets get into the country. 
Q: You me ntioned earlier that th
ere had been factory people and a
lluding that most of these had 
been Jewish who stood there with red flags. Wa
s it no -- only Jewish people?  We re there any 
Lithuanians? 
A: Well, there are many pictur es. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
52 
 
A: And whe n you look at the pictures, you can see 
the percentage. So I don™t want to answer 
how ma ny or not how many, just look at the pictures
, and there is a -- different features of these 
two nationalities. 
Q: How did life change in your personal relati
onships with the people 
that you knew?  Did any go 
-- did -- did any surprise you and -- and let™
s say become  part of the new system? 
A: Not from my close friends, but I want to te
ll you, out of 30 students, of the 30 pupils at the 
time when the Soviet entered, we graduated 
nine. It was all what™s left fr om 30. 
Q: And wha t  happened with the rest? 

A: Either deported to Sibe
ria, or  cross the border. 
Q: Left the country. 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: What happened after the Sovi
et takeover?  How did it impact 
your family in the very first 
instance?  Was it th
e loss of your father™s job? 
A: The loss of my father™s j
ob, the closing of bank accounts and introducing the s -- how ma ny 
square yards per person you were allowed to have
. So we were forced, in a nice way, to accept 
two fa milies to live together.  

Q: What kind of a place did you have  befo
re?  Was it a large ap
artment or a house? 
A: It was an apartment. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: A-According to our code -- conditions in Ka
unas it was a large apartment. Three big rooms, 
plus a smaller room for the servant, kitchen, ba throom and so on. So, we had a family in each 

room, and we were squeezed into one room. But 
this was survivable, this was not a tragedy. 
What affected more were the deportations.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
53 
 
Q: Can you tell us a little bit 
about that?  What happened there? 
A: Father, as I me ntioned before, was in Vilniu
s working for the health departme nt. I was going 
through my last exams and sint -- 
deportations started Thursday night. 
Q: On what month? 
A: June. 

Q: And wha t  year? 

A: ‚41 

Q: Okay. 

A: Couple of weeks befo
re the war started. 
Q: Okay. 

A: Mother couldn™t get through on the telephone to
 Vilnius to find out what™s going on. She was 
climbing the walls, we -- we didn™t know what™s
 going on. So she said lo
ok, I™ll get 
the suitcase 
ready. I™ll put Father™s winter
 clothing into the suitcase. Th
e mome nt you finish your exam, 
we™re running to the railway stat
ion, we™re going to Vilnius. And 
we ca me by rail to Vilnius. 
That was Saturday. Sunday morning the first bombs fell on Vilnius. 

Q: So you missed the deportations
, you weren™t on the lists. 

A: We  were on the lists. 

Q: You were on the lists? 

A: But my father wasn™t there and they coul
dn™t find our house. The house stood in between two 

streets on a hill. You couldn™t access it from do
wn, because it was locked, and you couldn™t find 
it from the top, because you couldn™t find it. 

Q: I see. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
54 
 
A: It was a very lucky and unlucky situation.Sometimes you know, I was thinking, if we would 
have been all together, and if we would been 
deported, ma ybe -- ma ybe he would survive. But I 
don™t give much chance to it because I don™t -- I d
on™t think he would survive. Usually they -- 
they shot the ma n from t he beginning. So anyw
ay, that what happened. I had the white dress on, 

Mama  had a light purple dress on. That was all we
 had, nothing. We  di dn™t realize that -- what is 
comi ng this morning, so we thought we™ll leave hi
m this stuff in case, for deporf -- deportations, 
we come  back to Kaunas. We  couldn™t get back. 

Q: Why not? 

A: Germ -- German ar my came in next morning. I mean, the war started next morning. 

Q: When you were al
ready in Vilnius. 
A: We  were already in 
Vilnius Saturday night.  
Q: I see. 

A: And war started Sunday morning. 
Q: So deportations happening on a Thursday night.  
A: Yeah, ye -- deportations ha
ppened two weeks before -- 
Q: On a Thursday night. 

A: -- on the 14
th
 - 15
th
 -- 
Q: I see. 

A: -- that™s when the deportations star
ted, yeah, two weeks before the war.  
Q: I see. So you were preparing in 
case that was going to happen -- 
A: In case -- 

Q: -- again. 

A: -- yes, yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
55 
 
Q: And any of your friends got deported? 
A: So I told you, out of 
30 we were left nine.  
Q: Did you talk to their families?  Wa s there 
anybody left to tell you what was happening, or -- 
how did -- how did you experience those deportati
ons, that™s what I™m saying. If you weren™t 
affected yourselves -- 

A: Trying now to tell you. You see, first night
 we didn™t know what™s going on. M -- I had my 
exams, and the next morning when I went to scho
ol, there were fewer of us. The first ones that 
were deported was our previous diplomatic mi nist
ry in Rome , Charnetskis™ -- Charnetski, they 
were my very close friends, all three children,they had five children and all the Charnetskis™ 

lived very close and th -- it was their daughter 
Lucia, I was especially
 close. And char -- no, 
Charnetski s weren™t taken the fi
rst days because -- no, you™re ri
ght, Charne tskis were taken the 
first night and they didn™t show
 up for Friday™s exam. Then we 
noticed next day some  others 
didn™t show up for the exam. By that time th
e town already knew what was going on. And you 
know what™s very interesting?  That week we 
had posters all over that
 [indecipherable] KGB 
choir is giving concerts in our city. And 
nobody put two and two together, why suddenly we 
have a KGB choir. See, this way they -- peopl
e saw them on t he street, but it didn™t occur to 
them that this is the help for deportations. They
 came  under auspices of mu sical unit, which they 
-- they were musical unit. But at the sa me  ti
me  we  had ta -- ca -- 
th-the city full of 
[indecipherable] people. So now whe n the deporta
tions started, the people who later on kept us 
for two years in hiding, they were originally fr
om Kaunas and Vilnius, an
d then their parents and 
brother were deported, the first 
night. And their children were 
already sent to the fi -- 
grandparents for summe r vacations. They were not -- 

Q: This was June, yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
56 
 
A: June. And they took the whole family, the 
grandparents, the son and the two children, put 
them all into the echel on. Echelon came to Vilnius,
 but the children were not on the list, so they 
took the children out of 
the echelon and tell them, go home . So they came -- 
Q: Off of the train they took them -- 
A: Out of the train, and they went home and they
 told exactly what has happened, that the whole 
echelon is full of people goi
ng to Siberia, and -- 

Q: But did they know it was Siberia? 

A: They didn™t know what was, it was Kaza
khstan, Siberia, whatever, but they knew that 
some thing awful is going on. So that was what co
mpelled tha -- it was a huge farm, huge one -- 
they went right away to -- to take ca
re of th -- of the place [indecipherable] 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And that was the fi rst information th
at we had directl
y, what™s going on. 

Q: So in your me mory, you reme mbe r  seeing Soviet
 soldiers in the streets who could have been 
part of the NKVD tw -- choir, but you never saw 
a -- a -- one of the trucks come  by in the mi ddle 
of the night, or you -- 

A: No. 

Q: -- didn™t see any other -- 

A: No. 

Q: -- actual instance of -- 

A: No, no, no. 

Q: Okay. And also you wouldn™t have known th
en, who would have been the people who 
informed. 

A: They had lists. The lists were ma de by th
e political personnel o
ffice, [indecipherable] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
57 
 
Q: I see. 
A: The political personnel office. Don™t forget
 that when you looked for a job, when Soviets 
came, you had to give infor mation three generati
ons back. You, your parents, your grandparents. 

So they had very good infor mation about everybody. 

Q: I see. Wh ere they lived, who they were. 

A: Absolutely. And I experienced[indecipherable] one in the sports
 circle. We  had a very highly 
trained group of sportsmen, a
nd that group was supposed to re
present Lithuania in Moscow 
sports festival. And you know between sport pe
ople, you took [indecipherable] you -- sports 
here, sport there. Anyway, just about a month be
fore the departure we were told that we are 

going through the political indoctrina tion gr oup. A
nd each one of us had to fill out the for m, 

giving back, again, three generati
ons who we are, and out of th
e group rema ined about a quarter. 
75 percent were not acceptable, and the leader
 of the group wa s a Soviet lieutenant from 
Georgia, Chechyan, he said my God, what am I go
ing to do?  I have to sh
ip the group to Moscow 
and I have 25 percent of the group. So he turned
 -- you -- he -- he knew 
-- we didn™t know about 
that spor t and polit -- politics
 are just  having some thing in common. He turned to the 
organizations, all kinds of sport 
organizations, clubs of the worker
s, factories and so on and he 
got people, but he had one month to train. 

Q: I see. 

A: He had one -- he said it™s unbelievable, 
how can I do it, I don™t know. But [indecipherable] 
the war came, there was no parade or anything, so --  

Q: So his problem was s olved. 

A: His problem was solved, right. But that™s how 
the Soviet operated, see?
 So by not -- by se -- 
sending 75 percent of the group out, you gave th
em a idea what™s going to happen to them. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
58 
 
Q: I see. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: Okay. We™re in Vilnius now. You™re
 in -- in your white summer dress. 
A: Yeah, in summer dr -- 

Q: You mot her, I think, 
has a purple dress.  
A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: You me e t  your father. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: You™re together again. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: And you hear airplanes overhead. 

A: Yes. Now, when we heard airplanes overhea
d, that was Sunday morning, I went to a line to 
get some  bread, I was standing in a line. The bi
gger bombings started at night. But since my 
uncle was working from Bank of Lithuania, a
nd the bank has vaults under the ground, we all 
went to the Bank of Lithuania to wait unt
il the bombs stopped falling. And we found e verybody 
who was working for the bank wa
s downstairs in the vaults. 
Q: But at that point your father was s
till a laborer in the health departme nt. 
A: In the health departme nt, yeah. 

Q: Your uncle still was at the Bank of Lithuania -- 

A: Right. 

Q: -- and the vaults of the 
bank were your bomb s helters. 
A: That™s right. 

Q: Okay. What happened after that? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
59 
 
A: We ll, in the morning we went back to the ap
artment. My -- in the apartment was my uncle, 
his wife, she was very pregna
nt and my father™s ma ma. 
Q: So, Uncle Solomon a nd his -- 
A: Solomon, his wife and his -- my father™s --
 my grandmother and my fa ther. And then Mama  
and I. 

Q: And how large was this apartment? 

A: Oh, two rooms, because it was Soviet 
-- Soviet time, you couldn™t have any more. 
Q: I see. So there was a lot of people. 

A: Lot of people, yeah. 

Q: And again, let™s take it further. In the next
 several days, next week
 or so, what are your 
me mories of that time?  What ha
ppened that was significant to you? 
A: I think it started with Jewish families being 
physically thrown out of big apartments in 
downtown Vilnius. 
Q: Who would do that?  Who wa
s doing those throwing outs? 
A: Both. 
Q: Both who? 

A: And the German offi cers who needed apartments. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And the help, Lithuanian help. There were no
 yellow stars yet. There was no -- no walking on 
sidewalk yet. The first what I reme mber, all the Je
ws have to bring to th
e police station, all radio 
-- radios. Think next one was all Jew -- 

Q: Did your fa mily do that? 

A: No. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
60 
 
Q: Cause you weren't Jewish, or cause you didn™t have a radio? 
A: No, because we were [indecipherable] for Jewi
sh. Next one was all the Jews are su -- to -- 
posed to bring to police stati
on, all jewels. And people did. The
n, around that time I think there 
was a provocation. The Germans accused that a Germ
an sol dier was killed. That was the first 
time that was something very ugly. 

Q: What happened? 

A: I think they called the Jewish elders
, a committee of the elders, Judenrat -- 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And they put a fine in so ma ny Je wish people, 
they had to report. But 
it still didn™t -- didn™t 
give people any idea. 

Q: You me a n, some  soldiers were
 killed, and then others -- 
A: A -- a soldier, a soldier was killed. The Germans claime d it and they -- then they called the 

me mbers of Judenrat and told them that they 
have to -- to send so ma ny -- I don™t reme mber now 
the number, so ma ny people to report to Lukiık
¡
s, to the jail. 
Q: And Lukiık
¡
s is a jail. 
A: Jail. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: After that, next one was Jewi
sh people wearing the, about thr
ee inches wide, white with blue, 
the Jewish Magen David on the sleeve. 

Q: Jewish star. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Right. 

A: After that was no walking on sidewalks. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
61 
 
Q: Did that affect you? 
A: In -- in what sense did that affect me? I m
ean, I -- I mentioned before that Father was still 
working at health departme nt, Ma ma  would go 
every morning with him too, and every afternoon 
to pick him up. She would hold him under the 
arm so that her hands was on his thing. 
Q: But you™re half-Jewish. 

A: Yes, I know, but in Vilnius 
nobody knew me . In Kaunas I wouldn™
t be able to -- to hide it. 
Q: So, in other words, you were not in Kauna
s when the -- when the -- the first pogroms 
happened?  

A: No. 

Q: You weren™t -- you weren't there -- 

A: I -- I was at Vilnius. 

Q: You were in Vilnius. 

A: Yeah, that™s why -- 
Q: Did you ha -- 
A: -- I don™t know anything about Kaunas. 

Q: I see. And was there telephone connection, or 
did you find -- when you were in Vilnius, was 
there a way that you could find out
 what was going on and that -- 
did find out what was going on 
in Kaunas, or not? 

A: No, because we were all in Vilnius. 

Q: I see. I see. So -- so 
you really had no knowledge -- 
A: No knowledge, no. 

Q: -- of what was going on there? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
62 
 
A: There -- what I knew -- what I knew about
 Kaunas was that Kaunas was given one month™s 
time for Jewish population. They were given the 
borders bordering stre
ets where they should 
move for fut ure ghetto. And in Kaunas the whole 
thing went in an orderly ma nner. The Jewish 
people took their furniture, took the 
-- took their belongings into th
at area. They had one month™s 
time to do it. In Vilnius there was no warning at
 all. The apartment which my Uncle S-Solomon 
had was in a building that  was the last  
building before ghetto wall. And when -- 
Q: On what street, excuse me , cause I know s -- 

A: Rudninku gatv
¡
. 
Q: Oh, so it was really right there across the street. 

A: Right there, right there. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And when the Lithuanian army soldiers came 
to put the boards to enclose, my uncle went 

downstairs, and he spoke perfect L
ithuanian and he told the soldie
r, look, my wife is expecting a 
baby any day, and my ol d mother, please let us cl
imb, as long as you are not too high yet. They 
just started, and the soldiers sai
d, go ahead, right away. So he took 
his mother, his wi -- pregnant 
wife and himself, they climbed that started wa
ll and they went inside. Now, the others were 
taken out to Lukiık
¡
s.  
Q: Excuse me now. The apartment that your family
 was living in, it was out
side the border of the 
ghetto? 

A: Outside the border, outside. 

Q: Okay, so they are still able to
 live in that apartment, or not? 
A: Oh no, no, no, no, no, no. 

Q: Okay. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
63 
 
A: That was the last building before the ghetto border. 
Q: So where did they go, if they couldn™t --  

A: They climbed the wall, went into the area. 

Q: We nt into the ghetto area. 

A: Right. 

Q: Without a place to live. 

A: Without a place to live. But th
ey were fortunate because they weren™t pushed to the jail, to 
Lukiık
¡
s jail. They escaped sure death, because  all 
the others who didn™t think so quick, they 
were already taken to Lukiık
¡
s and they never showed up any more. 
Q: All right, ma ybe 
I™ve gotten ahead of myself a little bit. 
A: Mm-h m.  

Q: We  were going through the sequence of wh
at was happening in Vilnius and -- and in 
comparison it was chaotic to what was happeni
ng in Kaunas as far as the ghetto being 
established. 

A: Right. 

Q: But we left it at such that people were
 had -- had to take their radios to -- 
A: Police. 

Q: -- the authorities. 

A: Yes. 

Q: They had to bring their jewels -- 

A: Jewels, yes. 

Q: -- there. They had to rep -- some , when a Ge
rman soldier was supposedly killed, the Jewish 
elders were told to get a certain num
ber of people to re
port to the jail. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
64 
 
A: Yes, yeah. 
Q: And then what? And then what? 

A: And then -- then this started the -- the mo
st awful period of the Jews being dragged from 
apartments by hapunes, by -- by the helpers. 

Q: By the Lithuanian helpers? 

A: Lithuanian helpers, right. Th
at™s when I told you the incident
 with -- did you -- you asked me  
-- 

Q: That™s right. 

A: -- whether there are other Lithua nian officer
s. That was what happened to Mr. Gornionski. 
Now what happened in our case, normally when th-t
hese --  see, in Vilniu
s, every house had a -- 
what would you call it i-in English?
 Not a janitor, but it was a --  

Q: Housekeeper of a sort? 

A: Not housekeeper. It was a person who took -- 
Q: A supervi -- a super. 
A: A super, right. 

Q: Superintendent. 

A: And all those supers knew everybody. So when th
ey -- the Lithuanians came  to take people, 
the super would take them to every door. She 
knew who lives where. So norma lly when they -- 

they -- they would come , Mama  would come  out, a
nd said no, there are no more Jews in here. 
Just like that. But that particular time it didn
™t work out. The super stood behind and Mama  ca me  
out, I came out, the gr andmother came to the ha
llway, because her Lithua nian was pe rfect. And 
the question was, any mo re Jews inside?  And we
 couldn™t -- couldn™t hide
 any more, the super 
was standing right behind. So, th
at™s probably the most difficult sc
ene I™ve seen in my life. He 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
65 
 
came into -- the hallway was little, the hallway. 
He came into the fi rst room. My father was 
standing, my uncle was standing, grandmother was 
there, Mama  and I. We  returned back. My 
father wore the army officer™s boots, and the -- th
e army pants. And he said, well, take a piece of 
soap, take one towel and let™s go. Now, we alread
y knew what let™s go more or less me ans. It™s 
Lukiık
¡
s. 
Q: That™s the soldier. That™s the -- 
A: That™s a Lithuanian. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Mama  started to talk to him. She said 
look, you™re a young ma n, you™re attending college. My 
husband fought for independence. He  put his books away, he finished high school after he 

returned from the front. He is one of the Lith
uanian volunteer fighters. 
Please leave him here. 
Under no circumstances. Under no circumstances. 
My mother went on her knees. She grabbed 
his hands, she started kissing his hands, begging 
him, please understand that he is not just a 
person, he is person who fought for you. And some
how finally, he agreed, with Mama  on her 
knees, he agreed to leave my father. 

Q: Do you reme mber what he looked like? 

A: Oh, not today, not today. I wouldn™t recognize him.  

Q: But do you reme mbe r  his ma nner, his -- hi s attitude? 

A: His attitude?  I couldn
™t care less, probably I would descri
be  it. He was told to ge t as ma ny 
Jews as he can, and my uncle was standing behind 
my  fa t h e r .  S o  my  mo t h e r  s a i d  t o  hi m a g a i n ,  
listen, that™s their mother. You left one son 
and you™re taking the other son. I™m begging you, 
please leave both sons to their mother. And she ma
naged to get my uncle left. When -- when -- 
Q: What about grandma? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
66 
 
A: No, the me n, men. 
Q: Oh, I see, they weren't taking wome n. 

A: Take a piece of soap, take one towel, you™re go
ing to build the east west, or whatever it was, 
highway. After he left our room, Mama  told me , 
go to the kitchen, see what™s going on. That was 

Soviet time . Every room had a fa
mily, and the owner of that huge house had his room. So I went 

out and I™ve seen that from the other room, they
™re taking a husband. His wi
fe was pregnant with 
a child too. And I went closer to
 the owner™s room, and I looked
 through the keyhole. So what I 
could see was a man told him to give all the jewe
ls first of all. You know, he took his watch, he 
took his rings. And then they took -- the ma n was in
 his probably, 80™s, very old person, to build 
a highway. So anyway, after that, Ma ma  ran to
 Mr. Gornionski™s pl ace, because they were 
kicked out from their luxurious apartment by Ger man officers. But in a -- in a polite way. But 

they had to leave everythi ng behind. She ran to 
the place where they lived with that -- sharing 
apartment with that Lithuanian officer, and th
at when Mama  found out what happened to Mr. 
Gornionski. And then the ma jor from our m
ilitary place, Major Songinas ran to Lukiık
¡
s to find 
him and couldn™t find him, that 
that was the end of it, yeah. 

Q: So these are the first days -- 

A: These are the first days, yeah, yeah. 

Q: -- of the German occ upation -- 

A: Yeah, yeah -- 

Q: -- of -- of Vilnius and -- 

A: -- yeah, yeah, yeah -- 

Q: -- what™s happening to the city™s Jews. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
67 
 
A: -- yeah, yeah. And the -- the most unfortunate 
thing was that the ghetto area was small, and 
the population in Vilnius was big. And there wa
s no warning and there was nothing to ma ke 
people go into the area. So they couldn™t fit so 
ma ny, so they just took the upflow, what there 
was, overflow to the jail, and from jail to Paneriai for liquidation. 

Q: But did people know that? 

A: No, no, people didn™t know what. Now, about
 knowing that, I™ll come  back to you. While 
Father was the head of Jewish hospital, one night -- 

Q: Can we leave this for a second? 

A: Sure. 

Q: Because we™re going to ba -- fini sh our tape 
and come  to the next -- to the next cass -- 
End of Tape Four 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527

Beginning Ta pe Five 
Q: This is some thing that is un -- I -- I don™t fu
lly quite understand it and 
maybe it needs a little 
bit more explanation. It sounds that all of a 
sudden, one day, without any warning, people show 
up, these hapunes show up in the various apartments
 across the stity -- city where there are -- 
where there are Jews who are 
living, and who are pushing them out of their houses, who knows 
where. Or is it they™re th -- just  taki
ng the me n?  What -- what was happening? 
A: Everybody. When -- when the exodus to ghett
o started, it was ever
ybody. Just leave the 
house. Old, young, baby, whatever. Everybody had to leave. 
Q: And they go to where?  Where they™re brought?  Where were they brought to? 

A: As long as ghetto had enough place for thos
e people, they went 
into the ghetto area. 
Q: Okay. 

A: When -- there is no explanation why cer
tain groups was taken straight to Lukiık
¡
s. 
Q: Straight to the prison, whic
h is on another side of town. 
A: Straight to the prison, another -- another si
de of town. The view 
that you saw was awful. 
People didn™t know what™s going 
on. People thought that they ar
e being grouped into ghetto. 
They were dragging pillows, blankets, pots and pa
ns, whatever they, in 
the panic they ma naged 
to take. The Polish population stood outside this
 on the sidewalks ma king fun. The atmosphere 
was awful, just awful. Now, that day a -- Father
 told me  to go to Colonel Usas home a nd stay 
with them, cause we didn™t know how much the 
Nuremberg laws will affect me , because the -- 
the nu -- 

Q: Did you know about the nur -- Nuremberg laws? 

A: Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes. 

Q: By that point you knew? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
69 
 
A: Oh yes. It -- but it™s a -- Nuremberg laws aff
ect three generations. Not 
the fi -- I was the first 
generation, and then my  parents and then my gr
andparents. So I stayed with [indecipherable] 
Usas, and Mama  took my father™s wa r me dals a
nd went to see our Prime Minister, Kubilunas. 
Q: I see. 
A: And she -- she ma naged to get into his office, 
and she told him, Genera
l, have a look at these 
documents. It™s your signature on my husband™s wa
r me dals. Aren™t you able to do some thing to 

help me ?  And Kubilunas was very polite, but he 
told my mother, Ponia --  Madam, there is 
nothing I can do in Jewish questi
on. It™s in the hands of the Ge
rmans and my hands are tied. I 
cannot do a thing. So Mother™s only hope, that 
Kubilunas ma ybe will help, disappeared. He 
couldn™t do a thing. And you couldn™t 
do a thing. It was all in the ha
nds of Gestapo, and that was 
it. And the SS. 

Q: And he was in Vilnius at that time?  

A: He was in Vilnius, he  was in ghett
o, he was the head of Jewish hospital. 
Q: No, no, no, I meant Kubilunas.  
A: No. The Lithuanian -- I think at that time  
that -- no, Mama  went to Kaunas. He was in -- in 
Kaunas. Our first governme nt, Kubilunas was the head of the governme nt, was in Kaunas. 

Q: I see.  

A: So when Mama  ca me  back from Kaunas, sh
e told my father that
 she couldn™t do anything. 
Now, I started to tell you -- 

Q: And whe r e were the -- 

A: -- I™m sorry. You asked me , did the people kno
w what™s going on. Quite awhile before ghetto, 
one night, I believe about five people escaped th
e shooting place Paneriai. There were three not 
connected, I think, women and two children, not c
onnected in between. They ma nage d to survive 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
70 
 
the shooting in the pit, and that night got out of the pit, found the two children alive, and they 
walked to Vilnius in the dark, towards Jewish 
hospital. When they came into the hospi tal, my 

father took them to a separate 
area and started to question. 
Q: So by that point he™s 
director of the hospital. 

A: He™s director of the hospital and they were
 all bleeding, so he sent
 his personnel with hot 
water to wash the blood fr om the sidewalks so that if the Germans catch it, there wouldn™t be no 

-- 

Q: Trail. 

A: -- trail which way did they go. The Germans di
dn™t catch it anyway. But my father isolated 
these people in the separate part of hospital because he was afraid of general panic. And he put 

the lady, by the name  Mrs. Salinski, she was fr
om Kaunas. She was a nurse -- she di -- no-not 

practically, she was -- she was a real, registered 
nurse but she wasn™t pr
acticing, and she was in 
charge of these people. The only person that went
 in and out, until he  figured out what to do, 
because he di dn™t know whether the Germans wi ll find 
or not. So by that time  my father already 
had an idea what™s going on in Paneriai. That™s it™s
 not going to build the 
highway east w-west or 
whatever, that is going straig
ht to the pits to be shot. 
Q: In other words, he -- if he had any doubts befo
re, he learned at that point, that when your 
mother fell on her knees, she saved his life. 

A: Oh, that™s absolutely. 

Q: Yeah, and also -- 

A: Absolutely, because  that -- that
 went to -- st raight to Luki ık
¡
s, yeah. 
Q: I™d like to get a better sense of the sequence.
 You talk of -- you talk 
of ma ss chaos, basically, 
people being forced into the terr
itory of the ghetto and those w
ho don™t have a room or a place 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
71 
 
are left in the streets, and if they™re in
 the street s, then th
ey™re taken to Lukiık
¡
s prison and then 
from there they™re taken to Paneriai, but pe
ople don™t know that yet.
 Is that correct? 
A: That™s right. 
Q: And then when these two ch
ildren, the three people, but tw
o of the m children, come  to, you 
know, to the Jewish hospital in Viln
ius, your father sees them, is that already when the ghetto has 
been established, even in its early days, or is
 that  before the establishment of the ghetto? 
A: Before. 

Q: Before. So there™s no ghetto yet. 

A: Before. No ghetto yet. 

Q: Is it after the time  he was supposed to have been taken? 

A: After. 

Q: After. 

A: After. Because at the time that he was supposed
 to be taken, he was still working for health 
department. 

Q: Okay. 

A: See? 

Q: Okay, so then -- so the -- this is where I™ d li
ke to get mo -- a little bi
t more clarity. So after 
that time your grandmother 
stays. Your uncles -- 
A: Uncle. 

Q: -- and father are saved by your mother. And it™s 
by a hair™s breadth, but there they are. Then 
did they come again for  them? Was there a second 
time whe n they were going to be put into the 
ghetto?  Do you understand, is -- 

A: No, I do -- I do -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
72 
 
Q: Yeah. 
A: I™m trying to figure out how [indecipherable]
. I™ll tell you what, the ho
use was to -- supposed 
to be Jew free. There wa s not supposed to 
be any more Jews in
 the building, see. 
Q: So what happened when that 
hapunes left without his quarry? 

A: Yeah, they -- he took all th
e others from the apartment. 
Q: Okay, but then the rest of you stayed in it? 

A: Mama  and I and uncle and gr
andmother, we stayed in it. 
Q: So it wasn't Jew free, in reality? 

A: In reality, yeah. 

Q: Okay. And that™s where you stayed? 

A: That™s where we stayed until – Mama  decide
d it was too dangerous to stay, for me. We  got a 

room Kalinauskas Gatv
¡
, in Kalinauskas Street, in an 
apartment where the owner of the 
apartment was a refugee from Poland, from
 Wars aw. Another room was take --  
Q: A Polish Gentile refugee. 

A: Polish Gentile refugees. Another room was 
by a -- also Polish refugee from Wa rsaw, of 
German extraction. And third room was ours. We 
moved out  because you -- y -- it wa s too da -- 
dangerous to be there. It wasn™t easy to get room
s. It was through the helpof a Lithuanian person 
who knew who we are and who helped us to get 
a room. In those you had the -- you -- that was a 
leftover of Soviet regulations, you 
had a certain area and you had a pers
on in charge of that area. 
So he was a person who worked in the admi nistra
tive office, and he helped us to get a room 
because he knew our situation. So that™s where we moved out.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
73 
 
Q: By that point -- excuse me , let me  back up a 
little bit, I want to focu
s a little bit on your gram 
-- on your father™s family. You had said earlier th
at your grandfather had b
een an invalid. By the 
time 1941 rolled around, was -- 
A: He wasn™t there. 

Q: He was -- he had already passed away? 

A: Yeah. He passed away, oh, he -- he passed aw
ay some whe r e -- I just reme mber my father 
wearing the black on his sleeve; 
that was, you know, custom in Eu
rope. I must have been around, 
no more than nine - 10. 

Q: Okay, so mi d-30™s. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Mid-30™s. 

A: He passed away. 

Q: And -- 
A: But in ghetto, in the first time when I cam
e in, in one room we had grandmother, father, 
uncle, his wife, newborn baby, a cousin, her husba
nd, her mother. So we had eight people in a 
room let™s say like from here to here. 
Q: A s mall roo m.  

A: Eight people in that room, yeah.  

Q: Okay. 

A: Mm. 

Q: That™s when we get to the ghetto, but -- 

A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: -- your father had four brothers, one of 
whom was with you in 
Vilnius, Solomon --  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
74 
 
A: Right. 
Q: -- with his wife, pregnant. 

A: Right. 

Q: And wer -- whe-where were the other two brothers? 

A: The sh -- Siauliai brother -- 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: -- was in Siauliai with hi
s wife and newborn baby, too. 
Q: And his name  is? 

A: Ephrain. 

Q: Ephrain was in Siauliai, okay. 

A: Yeah, Siauliai. Now, the youngest brother -- 

Q: Reuben. 

A: Reuben had a very strange story. He was betr
othed to get ma rried, and in the first day of 
deportation -- 

Q: To Siberia. 

A: Yeah, in the first day of deportation, they took
 hi -- the family of -- his fiancée and her family. 
He was getting out of his mi nd. So he said, I™m 
going to beg an -- KGB to let me  follow the 
transport. Mama  said look, don™t even try. It w
on™t work. The KGB is not going to let you follow 
the transport. So he said to me , go wi th me , I know
 where their offices are, private, not official. 
You stay on the other side of the street. If I 
don™t come  out, so you know that I didn™t come  out. 
Anyway, I was waiting across 
the street, he  came -- 
Q: This is still in Kaunas? 

A: Still in Ka unas. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
75 
 
Q: Right. 
A: That was before, the first night. 

Q: Okay. 

A: So he said they wouldn't even t-talk. No, th
at™s no and no. So, when the war started, he took 
my bicycle and he told my mother™s sister that
, listen, I™ll try, ma ybe I™
ll catch up with the train. 
The trains are not going very fast, they™re over
loaded. Maybe I™ll catch up with my fiancée on 
the train. And from that day on, we never heard 
anything about him. Later on, some body told us 
that he did ma nage to get to Soviet Union, but
 whether he found her or not, I don™t know. But he 
never returned. So, that means -- 

Q: He disappeared. 

A: He disappeared, yeah. 

Q: And you never found out what happened to him. 

A: No, no, no. I -- I looked at the 16
th
 division. The 16
th
 division had all their Lithuanian citizens 
in 16
th
 division. Nobody knew that he was in divis -- 
Q: The 16
th
 division was a Soviet army -- 
A: Soviet army, 16
th
 division -- 
Q: -- partisan [indecipherable] 

A: Yes, but he wasn™t there. 

Q: Mm-h m. He wasn™t there. 

A: So we figured that -- my aunt told him th
at, don™t take anything, just take the bicycle and go. 

But he wanted to take some  clothing and this 
and that on -- on my bicy
cle. So he said look, 
they™ll kill you for the bicycle, 
don™t take anything, just as -- 
if you can, peddle as much as you 
can. But we don™t know, you know, what happened to him. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
76 
 
Q: And -- and yet, you say some body told
 you that he did ma ke it to -- 
A: Some body told as if -- 
Q: Okay. 

A: -- you know, like as if my
 father is buried here, or as if my 
father is buried there. It™s nothing 
that -- to tie together . 

Q: Yeah, not really reliable. 

A: Mm-hm, no, no, no, not reliable at all. 

Q: What a sad thing. 

A: Yeah, sad thing. 

Q: Very sad thing. 

A: He was crazy when they deported her, just crazy. We ll, you know, so, that™s life. 

Q: So there are three br ot hers -- 

A: Three brothers. 
Q: -- and your grandmother. 
A: And her, yeah. 

Q: And they were all -- except -- ex
cept for your uncle in Si auliai -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- everybody was in Vilnius. 

A: Everybody was in Vilnius. 

Q: All right. 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: At this point it mi ght sound a little odd that 
I ask this question, but it
™s been on my mi nd as 
we™ve been talking. How do you identify yourself?  What was your identity? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
77 
 
A: You know, I grew up Lithuanian. 
Q: Wa s there any part of you where you felt Jewish? 

A: Not that I felt Jewish, but I mean, I had a lo
t of solidarity, I had a 
lot of -- you know, it™s -- 
it™s very difficult to define. You stand in the mi ddl
e of two sides. You don™t take any sides. If it™s 

necessary you™re here, if it™s necessary you™re
 here, and that™s how you grow up. I was never 
influenced by one side to be against another si
de. So I -- I really cannot
 tell you, but I grew up 
Lithuanian, but at the same  ti me  I have a lo
t in common with the Je
wish nation. I know much 
more -- when my cousin of the -- the Uncle Ephrai
n™s daughter, when they finally eve -- returned 
from Vorkuta and when he found his fa mily and when she came  to visit me , she kne w nothing 

about Jewish customs or anything. I took her to
 synagogue and she just 
looked around. I showed 
her, though the custom [i ndeciphera
ble] everything which we all 
-- we all know here, she had no 
idea, she grew up in Soviet Union. But at the sa
me  time I tried -- we have a very large population 
in We st Hartford of refugees from Soviet 
Union. We don™t call them Jewi sh, we call them 
Russians. I do a lot for them. And th-that™s -- yo
u know, when my mother went to see f -- Prime 
Minister Kubilunas, and when she came  back 
and she was aski ng my father, please do not accept 
any official position. Be a privat
e person. Because  his military friends wanted him to get out and 
stay in Lithuania, in the states, and forget th
e thing. And then one day he told my mother, you 
know what, wh-whichever things were, whichever 
things are, I see how 
my nation is suffering, I 
cannot do it. I cannot go into hidi
ng and leave things the way they
 are in ghetto, because there 
was a chaos. Can you imagine the 
Judenrat? Judenrat was a repr
esentative of each Jewish 
organization. There were so ma ny [indeciphera
ble] and Bundists and whatever you want, all 
Jewish gentleme n with big beards. Ca n you imagine 
a German officer comi ng to talk to them?  It 
-- it wasn™t possible. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
78 
 
Q: Is this what your father was saying? 
A: It wasn™t possible. They s
poke Polish, they spoke Yiddish, they didn™t speak Germa n. And 
they knew that in the hospital there™s some th
ing organized. Working, and working very, very 
well. He surrounded himself, since we  didn't know
 the Polish Jews, he surrounded hims elf with 
Jews from Kaunas. And they really had a atmosphere of work. The first German request from the 

hospital for so ma ny people, he had a separate 
section for syphilitics.So, you don™t play God, but 

you try to do some thing. So the first 
German request got the syphilitics. 
Q: Do you reme mber how ma ny people that was? 

A: No, no. 

Q: Did he talk about it at home? 

A: Well, heexplained to my mo
ther, that in order to save he
althy people, cause
 the syphilitics 
didn™t have very long to live one 
way or the other, and he was afraid to spread syphilis. The 
Germans di dn™t know that they 
were syphilitics, but they -- 
that™s what Ge rmans received, 
syphilitics. And that was his idea all the time , to
 save whatever he can. He  believed, which was 
really very strange, he  told to teach the ch
ildren Hebrew. And the population was agha st, what 
for? What do they need the Hebrew
 for, they™re going to die. So he
 said, they ma y die, and they 
ma y survive. If they survive, where do you think th
ey™ll want to stay, in 
Vilnius?  It™s -- it™s -- 
that™s you -- you know, place of their fa milies?  They™ll want to go to Israel. They should stop 

talking in Jewish, they should learn Hebrew, so
 if a day comes and God willing they are s -- 
living, they can integrate themselves
 into the Israeli soci
ety. See, he had different ideas from the 
others. He discussed with the rabbinical committ
ee in -- in ghetto, about how he is doing it. 
Because naturally they say you cannot play God. But he told them, look, I am giving, for 

example, 20 li -- li -- docume nts for life for th
e hospital doctors. And I 
don™t know these doctors 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
79 
 
in person, they were all Polish 
doctors. I lined them up in line 
and I tell the youngest ones, which 
in my opinion, by face and by the physique, look 
the youngest ones, I tell the 20 come  forward. 
So he says to my mother, how would you thi
nk, Elenka?  Should I sa
ve a young doctor who ma y 
survive and have children, or should I pick ou
t a famous profe ssor who is 80 years old?  Now 
what would you do in my place?  And you know, 
I was right there during the conversation. 
Mama  said, you know, I -- I cannot tell you how to be
have. But it™s very difficult for my father 
to pick out who lives, who doesn
™t live. But in a way, he had 
his opinion about it, that the 
strongest will survive, whether survive in ghetto or
 whether later on in the 
forest, but you have to 
give them a chance. Now, what chance can you give
 an 80 year old professor?  See, that was how 
he was -- how he would [inaudible] 
Q: You were part of these conversations at home -- 

A: Oh yes. 

Q: -- at age 14 - 15. 
A: Four -- age 14 - 15, yeah, absolutely, absolute
ly. We  had a  lot of these conversations with 
[indecipherable] Panana −ima it
¡
. You know about her. 
Q: Can you tell us about her?  Who was she? 
A: I found out who was she from the  Lithuanian pr ess now in Lithuania. There was an article by 

her brother who for the first time  said that she 
was a communist. I do -- I believe I st ill have the 
newspaper. Panana −imait
¡
 was a librarian in Vilnius 
University. And Panana −ima it
¡
 like us, 
had a permission to enter ghetto from Major 
Bourakas, another officer. And he gave her 
permission to enter ghetto as if she™s studying 
the Jewish old literature. And we me t her in 
ghetto. She was hiding a group of Je
wish people in the attic of V
ilnius University library. In 
summer it wasn™t so bad, but in winter it was aw
fully cold. Getting food in was one thing, getting 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
80 
 
waste out wa s another thing. So Panana −ima it
¡
 regularly, on the clock, wa
s in our place at four 
o™clock in the afternoon. 
Q: In the ghetto. 

A: No -- 

Q: Okay. 

A: -- that was out. And my father would co
me  for dinner around four o™clock. So shem -- 
−imait
¡
 and my fa ther, they would always get into all ki nds of political conversation and this and 
that. And sure -- I reme mber one day my father 
said, you know, I am pre tty sure that she is a 
me mber of c o mmunist party. By her attitude
, by you know, her answers and so on. But that 
didn™t -- that didn™t scar
e us away. The thing was that Panana −ima it
¡
 used to come  and get food 
every day, and we -- she had such a me tal -- me
tal little, like a bucket.
 And she would get a 
bucket full of food and c a rry to the 
attic, to the Vilnius, that -- 
Q: And that™s when he was st
ill director of the hospital? 
A: No. 

Q: That™s when he™s already -- 

A: He was already the head of the ghetto, yeah. 

Q: Okay. 

A: And that was day after day after da
y. Why did we start talking about −i ma it
¡
 now? 
Q: Some thing -- some thing jiggled your me mory. Bu
t we™ll come  back to her. I want to go back 
to the ot her question that I had when I asked 
you how did you identify yourself, because I had a 

follow-up question, and that is -- 

A: Now, I would say I -- I id
entified myself Lithuanian. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
81 
 
Q: When you saw -- when you saw the chaos in 
Vilnius and you saw Jews being expelled from 
their apartments and Poles standing on the st
reet and ma king fun, and the Lithuanian 
collaborators who were there, who were part of
 this expulsion, not doing it -- I mean actually 
doing it, not seeming to care very mu ch, did a
ny feelings go through you?  
Did you ever think to 
yourself, how could they do such a thing?
 Do they not see what™s going on? 
A: I -- I don™t think this was -- this was less beca
use of religion or nationality. I think that would 
be for a person unbelievable to watch from a point
 of huma n attitude. You didn™t have to be a 
Jew or a Czech or a French, just to be trea
ted like that. I me an, it was a double -- you know, it 
was a double, the way I was brought up, in a 
huma ne way, to watch that was beyond your 
understanding. It™s not just that because the people
 were Jewish, because they were people. They 
were not cattle, they were not animals, they we
re people. To watch peopl
e doing that to people, 
that was very difficult to watch.  
Q: I know. But earlier you said, when we were ta
lking about what befell 
people when the Soviets 
came in and what befell people when the German
s came in, you were explaining that there was 
this hatred Je ws because there ha d been some  on
 the streets waving red flags. And as a -- as an 
explanation as to why there was anti-Semitism, as 
an explanat ion as to why there was ha tred, and 

for ma ny people who were not there, who di
d not live through these times, that kind of 
explanation seems to hold very little water, 
exactly for the reason you just said right now. 
A: We ll, that was po-political, I would say. You 
see, we didn™t see the night deportations. 
Whatever we heard after mostly was that Russian
 soldiers were correct. The ones that came  and 
told people pack up your stuff and go into the 
truck. What we knew, what was going on in the 
building of KGB, that people we
re tortured, and they found 
later the traces of it -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
82 
 
Q: But wa -- again, I go back to, why would that 
be, if the soldiers were
 correct, then why would 
this kind of hatred, why would th
is kind of -- of anger be direct
ed at a Jewish population?  And I 
mean in the sense of explanations later, when
 people are expl aini ng things to themselves -- 
you™re sitting in Vilnius and 
you™re seeing the chaos of what
™s happening, and you weren't 
saying to yourself, oh it™s because they waved 
red flags when the Soviets were comi ng in, you 
were seeing people being dehumani zed. 
A: This is one thing, but the cooperation didn™t 
have to be so voluntar
ily. The cooperation was a 
-- I would say a result of the red flags,
 of the heads of 
political personnel -- 
Q: Whose cooperation? 

A: Lithuanian. 

Q: Lithuanian cooperation -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- was not so volun
tary, are you saying? 
A: No, I say -- I say this -- this is what it
 is. It didn™t have 
to be so voluntarily. 
Q: So you mean -- 

A: It didn™t have -- 

Q: -- they wouldn™t have collaborated had they not seen -- 

A: -- I -- I believe st -- very st
rongly that the two weeks before 
that, if the depor
tations wouldn™t 
be there, if we wouldn™t have had a whole year
 of political pe rsonnel trea
tment, of not having a 
right to live where you are,
 of having everything conf
iscated of what you ha --

Q: Maybe I™ll repeat a little of this. 
A: Mm-h m.  

Q: Of a -- you were a person who was integrated in
to Lithuanian society, who was part of it, and 
were more familiar with different communities th
an most people were. And here, all of a sudden 
in 1941, you see a huge inhuma nity take place.
 You see -- you see Lithuanians who you™ve 
grown up with and you are part of, come  and want to
 take your father away. 
And others -- even if 
not those particular soldiers, others who took ot
her people away. And some  
of them robbed them 
as they were doing it, and pocketed the jewelry 
and so on. How does one explain that to oneself 

about the culture one has come  from?  

A: I don™t believe you can explain. I s -- think ma
ybe you could say what motivated them to do 
it. Motivation can be all kinds, could be greed, co
uld be jealousy. There was no hatred such in 
Lithuania per se, there wa s no hatred. We  receive
d our independence from the Polish -- from the 
Russian Tsars regime . Russia is famous. The fi
rst pogroms were in Russia. We  didn't have a 
word pogrom in our language per se, we didn™
t use that word. We  never had pogroms in our 
country. The Russians were not able
 to switch that ugly behavior of
 theirs in our territory. But 
the seeds probably rema ined. On one side they 
lived as neighbors, very we ll together. Again, 
please -- I reme mber that during the Russian Tsar
s time, the Jewish people were not allowed to 
own land. And the reason they all went into busin
ess was not because they wanted to be business 
people, they were not allowed to work the land. So
 one came with the other. So naturally, if he 
was, say, a tailor or shoema ker or he was br
inging in his drosken kucher, some  kind of 
me rchandise to the farmers, that was the only way 
to survive. So after so ma ny years of Russian 
occupation, the first one, the Tsaristic occupation
, that rema ins. Now naturally, if you are a poor 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
84 
 
far mer and you work from four o™clock in the morni
ng til late at night, an
d ri -- next door your 
Jewish tailor is doing a good busines
s sewing and this and that and 
he doesn™t have to get up and 
milk his cows and ma ybe that brought some  kind 
of a jealousy?  But we never had incidents in 
our villages, in our towns. We  never 
had a Jewish Lithuanian incidents. 
Q: So tell me , when you have the hapunes come  by -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- these collaborators -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- come  by, what do you think motivated them? 

A: Deportations and re
d fl ags. I™ll sti -- 
Q: Deportations and -- 

A: Red flags. 

Q: -- and red flags. 
A: Yeah. I™ll stick to that. Cause I was one of
 those. It™s -- except that I -- I couldn™t 
[indecipherable] as low as that, 
but the feeling insi de was awful.
 The feeling inside was awful. 
Q: That there were people who w
ould to -- betray your country -- 
A: Yeah. 
Q: -- betray your other -- but w
hy would it ha -- okay, all right, but when you look at docume nts 
later, you -- people say that th
ey were all nationalities who are part of this great Soviet 
experiment, not just th
e Jewish nationality.  
A: No, and I told you before, according to pe rcentage, according to
 figures, the bigger 
percentage of Jewish populati
on was deported in Lithuania. 
You see, out of the total. 
Q: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
85 
 
A: There was not 30 percent of Lithuanians deported, but there were 
30 percent of Jewish 
population de ported. So it™s not logical, because 
actually there were very ma ny friendships in 
Siberia that we Jews helping Lithuanians, Lith
uanians helping the Jews, the old way, the way it 
was before in the country. Because they were all thrown into the same  kettle. 
Q: Yeah. Okay. 

A: So there -- there is no explana
tion. We can go back to Tsaristic times, to that Tsar istic hatred, 
to Tsarist -- Tsaristic po
groms. But again explain why didn™t 
we have a pogrom in our country? 
Not a single one. We  -- we knew the word, we knew 
the concept, but we never used the word in 
our language. See, that™s what very strange, 
wa -- how suddenly -- I have only my personal 
explanation is deportations and red flags. That
 really ma de, you know, the [indecipherable] in a 
very ugly wa y. 

Q: Thank you. We ™ll break right now for lunch and 
then we™ll come  back to the story itself.  
A: Mm. 
Q: Okay. You know, I [tape break]. Okay, I™d li
ke to get a better sens
e, even though we™ve 
talked and -- and touched on this before, of the 
transition from your father being head of -- the 
director of the Jewish hospital to being appointed
 head of the Jewish police. Can you tell me  
about the sequence of those events? 
A: I me ntioned that Mama went to talk to the 
Prime Minister ku -- Kubilunas and before she left 
she begged my father not to take any official dut
ies. Not to be tied, so that his name  wouldn™t 
figure anywhere and in case of n
ecessity she could take him out and that™s it. When Mama  ca me  
back, he told her exact words, 
ﬁI™m sorry, these are my people. 
I couldn™t refuse.ﬂ I me ntioned 
before that there was a Je wish committee of o 
-- el-elders and they we
re not able to grab 
[indecipherable] chaos. People 
everywhere, people on the str
eet, no food, nothing. They just 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
86 
 
were completely lost. And they heard that some body is in the hospital and keeps the hospital 
very firmly, there™s an order. So they came to 
talk to my father and they begged him, they 
begged him please, we are out of me ans, 
we don™t know what to do. So he took it. 
Q: We re you in the room when he said this to your mother? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Do you reme mber how you reacted to this? 

A: I didn™t react, but Mama  -- Ma ma  went pale.Mama  went pale. So she told him, well, you 

know, you did what you decided to 
do, but you realize that that™s
 it. There™s no way, now that 
you™ll be known to the Germans, that we can
 take you out and leave the ghetto. There™s no 
question about it. 

Q: You were living in the 
ghetto at the time already? 
A: No, we were comi ng in and out. 

Q: Okay. 
A: He started right away to orga
nize. People had to be placed so
me where. I me ntioned that in a 
tiny room there were eight of hi
s family, and that was very go
od. People were living 20 next to 
each other. There was no way what to do. He ha
d to find a way how to straight en everything, 
how to organize food, how to organize cleanlin
ess. Rubbish collection. Ca n you imagine to 
throw so ma ny people into one place without an
ything, no admi nistration?  
And so he started. 
Q: We re the borders already de
fined of what the ghetto was? 
A: Oh, it was boarded up. It was boarded up, ther
e were no borders like in Kaunas, it was -- they 
started to board up early in the morning, 
by the evening everything was boarded up. The 
windows that faced Vilnius™s streets were board
ed too. Every gate, every entrance was wor -- 
boarded up. So anyway, he surrounded hims elf mos
tly with Jews from Lithuania that he knew. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
87 
 
But he asked the elders, please give
 me  a [indecipherable] from Viln
ius, fr om polis -- Polish side 
that I could work with, because Papa didn™
t speak any Polish. Wh- Who in Lithuania spoke 
Polish?  Nobody. So they introduced Mr. Dessler. 
And Dessler™s old family was very known in 
Vilnius, very decent family. I cannot -- I cannot 
tell negative or positive 
about Mr. Dessler. I can 
only repeat what people were talk
ing and what my aunt saw.  
Q: Your aunt being your mother™s sister? 

A: Yeah. I was told by Father, together with 
Mama , that please do not discuss anything we™re 
talking about at home where -- when Mr. Dessler
 is present. And that was enough for us. And 
later, I don™t know how mu
ch there is truth in it or not, pe
ople are blaming Mr
. Dessler for my 
father™s untime ly death. Nobody knows why they shot
 him, whether to star
t the liquidation, they 
figured with him present would be very difficult 
to start liquidation. Whether they found out that 
he™s sending people to the forests. Whether th
ey found out that he knows how to procure guns, 
we don™t know. We  don™t know -- we  know from pe
ople that he was shot by the chief of the 
Gestapo, Neugebauer. We don™t know where are his 
rema ins. We  were told by people that he 
was buried in Ras
Ð
 kapi, the -- 
Q: That™s right, a cemetery that -- 
A: Ce me tery of [indecipherable]. And they put some  
plates, glass plates into the place of burial. I 

went to Ras
Ð
 kapi, talked to the caretakers, they 
said they™d never heard of anybody being 
brought by Gestapo into -- so anyway, ther
e is no place. We  don™t know anything. 

Q: You don™t know where he was shot? 

A: No, no. We know that he was shot 
at the Gestapo build
ing in Vilnius. 
Q: And the Gestapo building in Vilnius was where? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
88 
 
A: [indecipherable]. Wh at was the street 
name ?  I don™t reme mber. If you know where the 
students -- students live 
on the -- on the hill. 
Q: Orlando gartay? 
A: No, no, no, right in the center of
 Vilnius. [speaks Lithuanian] 
Q: This I wouldn™t know. I mean whe r e is -- 

A: It™s -- it™s one of the side
 streets from the main street. 
Q: Okay. I thought it was where the KGB 
building was, too, the same  building. 
A: Wa  -- the same  thing, same  building. 

Q: It™s the same  building, then? 

A: Sa me  building, right, yeah. 

Q: I see, so it™s at Lukiık
¡
s Square. 
A: Befo -- 

Q: It™s a building -- building near Lukiık
¡
s Square? 
A: But i -- co-coming fr om Cathedral -- 

Q: That™s [indecipherable] 

A: -- going straight, it 
would be to the left. 
Q: Correct, that building. 

A: Little street, that ™s -- 
that™s it, that was the -- 
Q: So that™s the building th
at your father was shot at. 
A: -- that™s the building was shot, 
right. Now, so he warned us to be careful what you talk, what 
we are talking at home in his presence. How 
-- what™s the role of Dessler, I cannot blame 
because I don™t know. People didn™t talk very ni ce
ly of him. Now, when he -- they introduced 
Mr. Dessler to Papa [indecipherable], Father tr
ied to find out more military personnel. He found 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
89 
 
Polish Major Vucht. He found Polish Captain Bagle. He found [indecipherable] Lieutenant 
Nikadrasin. Anyway, whoever 
was from military, he took right away to work. And -- 
Q: In what capacity? 

A: Police. Or der. Now, by the way, Captain Bagl e, I knew from Papa hundred percent. Father 

had a walking stick. He had two pieces. One he handed to Captain Bagle, one he kept hims elf. 

The historic pictures from ghetto
 were in these two walking sticks. When I me t Vilik, Captain 
Bagle™s son, who was my very close friend in 
ghetto, I me t -- me t hi m in New York, my first 
question was Vilik, what happened to your father™s
 walking stick? He said I -- I don™t know. No 
idea. 

Q: So the photographs in those sticks -- 

A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: -- from t he ghetto? 

A: From the  ghetto. Papa had a very good photogra
pher who was instructed 
to historically, in 
pictur es, to show the life in ghetto. So Vilik di
dn™t know anything, and Papa ™s thing disa ppeared. 

I™ll tell you later what I was able to fi nd. So that
™s how he started the administration, and you see, 
Kaunas and Vilnius had the completely different 
histories. Ka unas had barbed wire and Germans 
inside and at the gates. Vilnius ha d no barbed
 wire, because everythi ng was boarded up. Vilnius 
had one Lithuanian policemen. If you™ve seen pict
ures of the ghetto gate, there is one police -- 
little booth where the policemen stood and saluted 
my father. So he tried 
to avoid the fate of 
Kaunas ghetto by having Germans stand at the gate
, because Kaunas didn™t have forest s. Vilnius 
had big forests in the vicinity and very ma ny Jewi
sh survivors were hiding in those forests. And 
when fi nally it was little bit quieter  in ghetto, 
and people weren™t taken constantly to be shot, 
these people started to co me back to ghetto to
 survive, because it seemed that it™s nice and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
90 
 
peaceful. And people didn™t realize that we used 
to get ration cards only for official nu mber of 
inhabitants. And the unofficial people had to 
be fe d. And how would you feed unofficial people 
when it™s not enough for official people?  So Viln
ius had a completely different situation. Now, 
through my father™s conn ection with Lietukis -- 

Q: With [indecipherable] 

A: -- for so ma ny years -- 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: He, for example would get a shipme nt of fro
zen potatoes. The Germans would be told that 
potatoes are frozen. 

Q: They™re no good. 

A: No good for public consumption. The Germans 
-- and they say, can we
 throw it to ghetto?  
And Ger ma ns would say yes, you can throw it to 
ghetto. That™s how -- but that wasn™t all, you 
had to feed thousands, it wasn™t in hundreds, 
it was thousands. So the only thing was to get 
illegally food to ghetto. You must 
have heard -- and in the -- in -- 
in writing too, the very, very, I 
would say rough treatment of people comi ng back fr
om wor k at ghetto gates. And you would -- I 
heard myself, standing across the 
street on the sidewalk, Polish
 people talking, why do you need 
Germans in here?  Look how the Jews
 are treating the Jews. That was 
my father™s idea, to ma ke it 
look so bad that the Germans w
ouldn™t need to bring either Uk
rainians or Lithuanians or 
Latvians to the ghetto gates, because if you would 
have either one of those people at the gates, 
these people would die from hunger. 

Q: So in other words, what would -- I™ll back 
up just a little bit. As 
far as anybody else guarding 
those gates, it was one 
Lithuani an soldier -- 
A: He had nothing to do with the gates. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
91 
 
Q: -- in a booth, and that was it. Okay. 
A: He was just standing on the si
de, he had a little booth, and he 
was stuck in that booth, that™s 
all. 

Q: And there were no German soldiers around? 

A: No Ger man soldiers. But, by having Jewish
 police behave the way they behaved, Father 
escaped having Germans at the gate. Now, nop -- I never -- 

Q: Did you see how they behaved?  Did you -- 

A: Oh, sure I did. 

Q: What did they do? 

A: I™ll -- I™ll tell you. Father had meetings of th
e leaders of the brigade. And the leaders were 
handed in a plan. If two go through, the third one
 will be hit. Three go through, the fourth one 
will be hit. So that, watching from outside you ha
d a picture that the Je
wish police is hitting 
returning workers because th
ey find some thing. And you woul
d. The two that go through, no 
food. The third one, food. The three, no food, the 
fourth one, food. And e very week there was a 
meeting of brigadiers with in
structions how to bring food. Th
e only unfortunate case was when 
Mueller caught our singer, Luba Levitska. Sh
e had a pound of green peas. Green peas, now 
scientifically, has the same  vita mi ns as meat. 
Mueller happened to come  to the gates and he 
caught her with a pound of peas. 
And as much as my father 
tried to get her from Lukiık
¡
s, if it 
would have been a Gestapo case, he would 
be able to smuggle her out. With a Gebiets 
commissar, the civilian case, he was not able an
d she wa -- wa s finally shot. But anyway, there 
was a system how to get food. Another thing was -- 

Q: Can I -- I™m sorry -- 

A: Yeah, go ahead. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
92 
 
Q: -- that I™m stepping back, but I 
wanted to understand this. The wo
rk brigade is told that  every 
third and then every fourth, and every x person -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- is gonna be hit. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: And that two should have no f
ood and the third should have food? 
A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: So they find food on that person? 

A: No, no, they -- 

Q: Or it™s the fi rst tw
o have the food -- 
A: The -- the first two -- th
e first two are ma king up, they 
are getting [indecipherable] 
Q: They™re getting food in. 

A: -- to the left  and to the righ
t, and the third one goes through.  
Q: I see. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: I see.  

A: But the picture from outside, 
the people that know to count one
, two or three, looking from 
outside it looks awful. A Jewish policeman hit
ting a Jewish worker. And you don™t figure two or 
three goes through, but ma in thing 
is, two get hit, third one brings food inside. Because bringing 
the food and getting caught was 
punished. Punished by death. 
Q: Okay, so he would catch pe
ople who just never happened -- 
A: Never. 

Q: -- to have any food on them. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
93 
 
A: That™s right. And the third one or the fourth on
e, but there was a plan, they -- they -- the head 
of the brigade knew the pl an. Now, for example, the older br igades came on the wide 
[indecipherable] 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: -- it was in Polish. If there happened that e
ither Gestapo or Murer was at the gate, Mama  

would go to one direction, I would go to anothe
r direction. We had only three words to tell, 
Murer colo brani. Murer at th
e gates. Everybody would lower th
eir food on the street, because 
that meant death, you see. So that™s -- 

Q: So you were in some  ways involved in the br inging of food into the 
ghetto, in the ver -- 
A: I-In -- well, not in directly, but -- 

Q: That™s right. 

A: -- warning, warning not to bring food 
to the gates until it™s clear, you see. 
Q: Let™s talk a little bit about 
how -- how you saw what you did, because that™s a little murky at 
this point  in the stor y, because what we™ve seen 
-- what we™ve heard so far is that you™re living 

outside the ghetto, your father is 
appointed head of the police, a
nd we™ve dropped that part of the 
story. Bring us up to date on what ha -- wher
e did your mother end up living, where did you end 

up living? You -- we me ntioned before your grandm
other -- your father™s mother and your uncle, 
where were you all placed in -- in th
is geographical scheme  of things? 
A: Okay. Father had one tiny room. 

Q: In the ghetto? 

A: In the ghetto. As the chief 
of police. Next to that tiny ro
om was a door, regular door, to a 
large room, where about 30 people lived. Upstairs 
was one little room. M y uncle, his wife, the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
94 
 
baby and Grandmother, in one little room. Now, 
we had an apartment across the st reet from 
ghetto, I would say ma ybe 200 yards away, G
¡
li
Ð
 Gatv
¡
 
Q: Flower Street. 
A: That was Flower Street. Now we™re comi ng to 
a person I would like to 
talk about. The whole 
area was in the hand of a Lithuanian Major Naru
sias. That whole -- whol
e section, including the 
area where ghetto was. A -- Murer used to come
 very often to ghetto 
to check on non-working 
population, because there was supposed
 to be no non-working population. 
Q: Tell us who is Murer? 

A: Oh Gebiets commissar [indecipherable] 

Q: Oh, he was the assistant -- 

A: Assistant to Hingst. 

Q: I see. The -- the -- 

A: Assistant to Hingst, yeah Gebiets commissar. 
Q: [indecipherable] 
A: And there was an instruction during the 
day, whoever didn™t work and had no working 
scheins, not to walk the st reet s.
 So not ma ke an impression that there are plenty people who are 
not workers. But it was impossible in a room lik
e that, there were bunkbeds. In a room like that 
would be at least 30 people. You had to put them
 some whe r e. Now, Narusias was Pa pa™s friend. 
So he went to him and said, look, Stefan, th
ere are buildings outside
 the ghetto where nobody 
lives. Nobody wants to live to -- th -- next to 
Jewish ghetto. Why don™t you talk to the Germans, 
explain to them that these buildi
ngs are getting ruined. No heat, 
water seeps in. Tell the Germans 
that you would like to attach those buildings to th
e ghetto area. That proposition costed my father 

a lot in gold, in diamonds. But Narusias went to
 the Germans and he attached a big area to the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
95 
 
ghetto, so that first of all you wouldn™t have 
30 people in a room. You ha d already place to 
breathe, and you wouldn't see so ma ny people on the street. 
Q: Wa  -- can you tell me, do you know the particular
 buildings and the part
icular streets that 
were attached? What streets they were -- 

A: I-If you come  -- if you come  through the gates, th
e left side . From the gates to the left, that 
was the area. 

Q: Okay. So it would be -- it w
ould be streets that would go towa
rds the church of Saint Michael 
and Sionta Mykoloyos, or it would be -- 

A: Oh, Mykoloyos Natan, no. 

Q: It would be going -- 

A: Well, it --  it was bordering Pino Gatv
¡
. 
Q: I know that. 

A: But f-further outside the ghetto wall. 
Q: Okay. 
A: Yeah, I -- I can™t know the -- remember 
all those name s. But anyway, that helped 
tremendously, and that was possible to do only 
through connections and 
through old friendships. 
Q: And bribery. 

A: Oh, sure, what you say. Nobody would do it unl
ess it -- but at least it gave results. 

Q: Yes, yes. 

A: It gave tremendous results. Now, he still had 
a problem with food, how to feed the people. So 
he discussed with Germa ns the possibility to fo
und more and more workshops. And they agreed 
that they could have in ghetto a workshop for fu
rniture. They had their own telephone, they were 
not allowed to use city telephone, and they had all kinds of workshops, and they -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
96 
 
Q: The police had their own telephone? 
A: Well they probably -- 

Q: The ghetto police. 

A: -- probably, yeah. Probably had. And the Germans 
agreed to Father™s idea to take the boards 
from one of the door from previous stores, open 
the store with samples what the Jews can do in 
ghetto and what people can come and order to 
be done. That was anothe
r outlet to get foods 
legally. 

Q: Okay. 

A: Legally, right, I mean -- 

Q: That™s right. 

A: -- they the -- you know, to get food. 

Q: That™s right. So they w
ould ma ke things to order. 
A: To order, yes, but those people who came, at the same  time it had people who had nothing to 
do with coming for order, they just smuggled food 
to ghetto. But th -- unt
il one day they caught a 
big shipme nt comi ng at night through the gates. 
And they requested Father to give the guilty 
parties for arrest. And there 
were two people in charge of
 that, Mr. Trapeida and Mr. 
Biniakonski. When Papa called them in, they sa
id commandant, you™re not 
going to be in charge 
of that. We ™ r e taking the respons
ibility and we™re going to Lukiık
¡
s. You don™t know anything 
about the transport, you have nothing to do with 
it, so that in front of Germans your hands are 
clean. So they took Mr. Trapeida
 and Mr. Biniakonski to Lukiık
¡
s jail.  
Q: So these weren™t part pa -- 
these weren™t people from the 
ghetto, these were suppliers -- 
A: Ghetto -- ghetto -- ghetto people. 
Q: These were ghetto people?   

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
97 
 
A: The Germans requested to give the culprits. W
ho is in charge -- who 
is in charge of getting 
that food into ghetto through the gates. So -- 
Q: Okay, we™re going to have to -- 
End of Tape Six 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
98 
 
Beginning Ta pe Seven 
Q: Okay, so these two people who were
 as themselves ghetto inmates -- 
A: Yes. 
Q: -- went to your father -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- and said, we™ll offer ourselves up, basically. 

A: And they told my fat her that -- they -- they called my father commandant. [indecipherable] 

Commandant, you™re not going to take responsibil
ity, we™re taking the res
ponsibility. They were 
in charge of the food supplies. They said, what
ever happens, we  go, you stay. They -- Fa ther had 
to bring them, and they were brought to Lukiık
¡
s. Thank God Father was able to buy them out. 
They -- all wer -- they suffe
red was frozen toes. Lukiık
¡
s had no heat and the winters in Vilnius 
are very, very -- 

Q: Cold. 
A: -- cold. So they finally got them out. And usua
lly -- it was always -- not always, but in ma ny 
cases, possible to buy out from Gestapo arrest, bu
t not from the Gebiets 
commissariat. Whenever 
the civil SS -- SA, brown uniforms were i
nvolved, like Murer, you couldn™t do anything. 
Q: So the Gestapo was more corruptible? 

A: Gestapo you br -- corruptible. 

Q: I see. 

A: Corruptible, yeah. Now, in the Gebiets co
mmissariat building, you know
, there is a proverb 
that sa y that world is not wit
hout good people. One day Father me t a ma n, he looked familiar. 
And then he said, Colonel Keenas. He said yes, 
but now I am Colonel Kune. Father™s friend from 
army.

Q: Mm-h m.  
A: When the Soviet came, there was repatria
tion to Germany, whoeve
r could save himself 
finding an old aunt, and old grandmother from Ge
rman descent, he went to Germany. And that 
Colonel Kune is actually to be thanked for my 
life and for my mother™s life. Every fi rst of the 
month he was issuing my father two permissi
ons, for Mama  a nd for me  separately, to use 
Lithuanian railway system. You couldn™t go 
and buy a ticket to buy -- go on the train. Every 
month on the [indecipherable] my fa ther would bri
ng us this permission to use the railways. See, 

that™s all network of Lithuanian officers. 

Q: But here I want to come  to a point where 
it™s highly unusual that, in
 my mi nd, thinking that 
some body who so the head o -- head
 of the ghetto police would be 
able to keep his wife and 
daughter outside the ghetto. 

A: Nobody knew. Nobody knew. 

Q: Why didn™t they know?  
How could they not know? 
A: They didn't  know. 

Q: So the Germans did not know? 

A: Didn™t know. 

Q: Didn™t know he had a wife and daughter? 

A: No, no, they didn™t know. One day we were wa
lking on the Pilmo Street
 together and We iss, 
one of the murderers, was going in 
a [indecipherable] 
a horse -- horse. 
Q: Drawn carriage, mm- h m.  

A: Yeah. And then he said to my father, oh 
I saw you on the street. Who a r e these people?  And 
my father said oh, two very old acquaintances. Nobody knew. Until Father was shot, nobody 

opened their mouth.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527

Q: So even i -- di -- did people in the ghetto
 know that he was ma rried and had a child? 
A: Yes. How otherwise I would know everybody?  Pe
ople in the ghetto di
d, but they would not 
squeal. That™s why they say that their -- they 
suspect Dessler, that Dessler squealed after my 
father was shot. I don™t know. I cannot blame b
ecause I don™t know. Now I -- I had a friend in 
Gestapo, a Lithuanian in Gestapo unifor m, who 
was a real friend from my childhood, from high 
school, in sporting events. He never squealed. So
 what -- the way the Gestapo came after us, it 
had to be very, very clear information, where we 
are, where we live, but 
that stopped in there. I 
me ntioned to you that we  were about 200 yards from ghetto, across the street. And they came  

into the apartment, they ripped everything apart.
 They ripped the floorboards. Whats they were 
looking for, I don™t know. They were looking for 
guns, for -- for some  kind of written ma terial, 
whatever. 

Q: This is after your father is shot -- 

A: After. 
Q: -- and they™re comi ng to get you? 
A: Yes. 

Q: And you were there, you saw this? 

A: No.  

Q: Okay. 

A: We  were given 10 mi nutes to disappear. Fathe
r™s helper came  one day and said, Mrs. Gens, 
please take Ada and disappear im
mediately. Nothing taken, just wa
lk out of the apartment the 
way you stand, not to throw any suspicion or anything. Mama  --  

Q: What time of year was this? 

A: That was the day he was shot. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
101 
 
Q: What time of year was that? 
A: Oh, that was in September. 

Q: Okay. 

A: Yeah. And he said, just disapp
ear. But he didn™t tell that Fa th
er was executed. Ghetto knew it, 
we didn™t know it. We  di dn't know it for a long 
time. And my  mother™s 
sister know -- knew it, 
but she wouldn™t tell. 

Q: Okay, so that day you were leaving the apartment, you™re told to -- 

A: Just walking out into the street. Next day th
e Gestapo came  into the apartment. And how do I 
know how it looked?  Right across the landing was a
nother apartment with a Polish refugee from 
Warsaw who was hiding her son inside the apartment. And our back door, from the back 

entrance, were again, one across the other. So 
she was watching what the Gestapo was doing and 
when my aunt came in, my aunt came  in through 
her apartment, opened the back door, and came  
in with her. They Gestapo kept the person hidde
n behind the front door for three days thinking 
that maybe we™ll come in or whatever. But natura
lly, by that time we were out be -- because of 

these permissions to use the train, we were able to escape. 

Q: Then your aunt came  into an apartment 
which had some body waiting be hind the front door. 
A: No, after that -- 

Q: After that. 

A: -- after that, yeah. 

Q: After that. 

A: You couldn™t do that, th
at was [indecipherable] 
Q: Okay, so in other words, they knew, her neighbor knew, people knew that ther e™s still 

some body st anding there for three days. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
102 
 
A: Outside, yeah. 
Q: O-Okay. 

A: Yeah, yeah.  

Q: If that™s the case that nobody knew from
 the Germans that you had any connection 
whatsoever to the head of the ghetto police, how
 was it that you had perm
ission to go in and out 
of the ghetto?  Wa sn™t that restricted?  

A: I ha -- I mentioned before, was Major Bour
agas, again another military friend, issued 
permission to cross the gates. Panana −ima it
¡
 had one, my mother had one and I had one. 
Q: And how often did you go 
in and out of the ghetto? 

A: Me? 

Q: Yeah. 

A: I would say I spent more than 50 percent time 
in ghetto than in outside, because it was safer 
for me  in ghetto than being round up in -- in
 the town for labor work in Germany. 
Q: I see. So as there was ghetto life, there was 
-- still were roundups w
ithin -- outside the ghetto 
walls. 
A: With -- outside the ghetto walls for the ge -- Gentiles. 

Q: I see, I see. And the ghetto -- can you just gi
ve us this frame, the ghetto existed from what 
date until your father™s ex
ecution and then beyond. Ca -- 
do you reme mb er the dates? 
A: According -- according -- I wasn™t there -- 

Q: Okay. 

A: -- according to the books that I 
read, the liquidation started on the 23
rd
 of September. 
Q: 19? 

A: ™43. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
103 
 
Q: Of the ghetto. 
A: Of the ghetto. 

Q: Okay. And it existed -- it was founded -- 

A: From -- founded, I would say 
two years. ™41 - ™42 - ™43. 

Q: Okay.  

A: Yeah. 

Q: So late summer, early fall, ™41? 

A: Right. 

Q: And -- and in those -- 

A: Until exactly 23
rd
 of September, ™43. 
Q: And 23
rd
 of Septembe r is the date
 you left your apartment -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- and the date your father was shot? 
A: We  don™t know. We  weren™ttold. 
Q: Okay. 

A: You see, we weren™t told for several months. 
We -- we didn™t know -- had told that Father is 
dead. 

Q: Do you reme mber the last time you saw him?  

A: Probably day before. 

Q: Anything me morable from that -- from that -- 

A: No. 

Q: No?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
104 
 
A: Regular. Mm, you se e, so ma ny - -  so ma ny th
ings happened in between. There were roundups 
of people in small ghettos outside of Vilnius. Wh ile Papa was a
live, children were not touched. 
After Papa was dead, they took the children. My mother™s sister tr
ied to get my cousin. When it 
was time to go, the mother wouldn™t give. She sai
d, oh, as long as my -- my father is there, 
nothing will happen to my daughter
. Let™s wait. And then when 
one day they put Ukrainians 
around, you couldn™t get anything out. So then my  aunt
 went to Siauliai, where it was exactly the 
same  story. The mother wouldn™t give her childbefore, and when my aunt arrived from Vilnius 
to Siauliai the ghetto was surrounded. So she c
ouldn™t save the other ch
ild either. She ma naged 
to do some body™s -- 

Q: You me a n your -- your -- 

A: Mother™s sister. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Yeah, yeah. 
Q: No, no, you mean your mother™s sister w
ho went, but it wa s your uncle™s children.  
A: U-Uncles™ children, both unc
les here and uncles there.  
Q: When you had permission -- I™m sorry to go back to that -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- but when you had permission to go into th
e ghetto, what was the reason for it?  What was 
the ostensible reason for why a Gentile girl w
ho ha s no connection to the ghetto, would be going 
there? 

A: Who would know that?  Just the Jewish people.
 The Jewish people knew that I™m his daughter. 
I -- how would I know everybody, if 
I wouldn™t have been there? 
Q: No, I™m - -  okay. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
105 
 
A: So I me a n, the Jewish people, everybody knew. That™s what I said, until Father wa s alive, 
nobody squealed. We  don™t know who squealed afte
r he was killed. We don™t know. And I can™t 
put a finger or anyone, because you don™t know. 

Q: What would you do when you would be in 
the ghetto? What would be your job or your 
function -- 

A: No job, no job. 

Q: -- or your activities? 

A: We  had a group of people that we knew each ot
her very well from Lithuanian, Kaunas area, 
and there were a group of younger -- you know, we 
were young people. Ca n you imagine at that 
age, we just finished high school, 
all of us, and it -- it™s
 awful. You™re -- you™re -- it™s depressing. 
There is no way to express -- I --
 I don™t know what -- what to sa
y what would I do. I would visit 
everybody. We would stay in groups. There was a lot 
of things to do in ghetto, there was a c -- 
there were activities that I 
attended. Papa took me through th
e pur -- orphanages, through the 
kitchens, you -- you know, with him,  to show me
 how things are going. And then I just would 

say -- stay with grandmother, with Papa™s family. That™s -- you wouldn™t do very much. I had 

one very, very bad experience when Murer came  
into the ghetto and Papa ma naged to sh-shove 
me  out from the door into the next apartment,
 and Murer was checking apartments. I had nothing 
on me , no schein, no yellow -- 

Q: Star. 

A: -- stars, nothing. But luckily, he didn™t get into that room. There were
 oh, at least 30 wome n 
in that room and pa -- can you imagine if Murer 
would come  in and yi -- Papa would have to 
explain to them why are these 30 
ladies in the room, not working. That was a very, very narrow 
escape. But it -- it worked out. And then, you know, 
I participated a lot. I used to -- you must 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
106 
 
know that ghetto had a very str
ong cultural life. I 
used to bring information about the place they 
were playing. For example, at th
e same  ti me  ghe tto had in Vilnius theater, there was a play called 
”mogus Potilto. 
Q: Oh, person under the bridge. 

A: A person under the bridge. So I used to bring th
em sketches and tell howthey do that, so that 
the -- the Jewish production was not worse than 
the production in Vilnius.
 And I took musical 
lessons. I continued, I couldn™t go to conservato
ry because I was warned at the philharmon -- 
philharmoni a -- not to show myse
lf. So I took music lessons, I st
ayed and played, not norma l as 
if it™s a normal life. It was the nor
ma l, but as much as possible. 
Q: But some body in Vilnius outside the ghetto knew who you were, because through the 

philharmoni c they found out. 

A: Yes, somebody did, yeah, some body did. 

Q: Did you -- did you participate aside from warni
ng workers as they™re comi ng back that Murer 
is at the gate?  Wa s there any othe
r wa y that you participated in some
 of t hese activities to help -- 
help the ghetto, and help the ghetto in -- inha
bitants. Wa s it through the kitchen, was it through 
other kinds of activities of taki
ng care of some  of the old peop
le or -- or -- or such?   
A: No. No. I -- I went, I saw, I was -- Papa t
ook me  to show, but I didn
™t participate in any 
admi nistrative work. 

Q: Did your mother? 

A: Don™t forget I was 15 years old. 

Q: Yes, it -- anyways -- 

A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: Yeah.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
107 
 
A: A -- 
Q: He mi ght have not 
wanted you to, either.  
A: I don™t know, but at 15, what -- I mean, he had 
the -- the very well trai
ned personnel to do all 
that. For example, there was no hunger. The childr
en, the orphans were very well kept. They had 

quarters where they lived. Jusef Mushkat was one of
 Father™s helpers, police me mber. He was in 
charge of orphans so that there were no people on
 the street, sitting or 
begging or anything like 
that. And whoever survived the ghe
tto is a testimony that Vilnius was very well run as far as the 
feeding, the hospital. They had babies. Under Ge
rman law you couldn™t have babies. Papa had a 
section where babies were born, so that ev-everything was done, whatever it was possible to do. 

Q: Let™s go back to the time  when he  was -- stil
l in the very beginning, he was director of the 
hospital and the two child
ren crawled out from t he pits of Paneriai -- 
A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: -- and ma ke their way back, and he hides them
 in this room. What happened to those children, 
do you know? 

A: What happened later? 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Later I don™t know, there we
re thr --I think -- believe th
ere were three ladies -- 
Q: Three -- 

A: -- and two children. 

Q: Do you know what happened to them?  

A: No. 

Q: No. 

A: Right now I -- no, I don™t.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
108 
 
Q: And did he have such -- you know, and at that
 point you talked about he
 had to turn over to 
the Germans a certain number of people -- 
A: Yeah, right -- 

Q: -- from t he hospital. 

A: -- right. 

Q: I take it that must have c
ontinued in the ghetto as well? 
A: Absolutely, absolutely, absolutely. 

Q: And were you -- did he talk
 to you about these things? 
A: Oh, surely. I -- i -- you need 
an outlet. You can™t work under 
such pressure where huma n life 
is involved. You -- you have to try to -- to get 
the best of the wor -- 
du-during the worst, you 
have to try to do the best you can, but it™s very
 difficult. I portrayed to
 you the selection of 
doctors. Those selections were going all the time . 
And they are painful selections, because why -
- why Joe and not Peter?  Why Pete
r and not Joe?  It™s impossible.
 But one thing which Vilnius I 
think is famous for, no corruption. You couldn™t buy 
a life certificate for m
oney. You hear that in 
other towns. You hear that in Wa rsaw. I™ve 
heard that in Lódz, reading the books, you cannot 

find one single case of life 
certificates sold for money. 
Q: There are though -- there is 
that incident, I think, outside
 of town, was it Oshmini? 
A: O-Osh mena 

Q: Osh men -- Oshmena.  

A: Mm-h m, Osh mena. 

Q: Where in some of the things that I™ ve writ 
-- I™ve read, it™s written 
that  some of the police 
came back rather well-to-do. Now, can we ta -- 
can you tell us about what the whole incident 
was at Oshmena?  What -- how distance i -- you 
know, its geographical distance from Vilnius -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
109 
 
A: In -- in the -- in --  
Q: -- and what happened there. 

A: I don™t know geographically ho
w ma ny miles, but therewere 
couple of s mall places -- like 
small ghettos, and the Ge rmans, the plan was that
 they will be brought to Vilnius, to close the 
small ones and bring them to Vilnius. And that
™s what it was assume d will happen. When Papa 
didn™t go there, when the police went over there, th
e Germans told them that these people are not 
going to Vilnius and that they will be finished. In
 those writings -- I read them -- what I believed 
what happened, this was the mostly gold pieces
, money. The Jewish nation went through so 

ma ny uphea vals and pogroms in Tsaristic Russia, th
ey didn™t keep paper money, they ca -- kept 

mostly golden pieces, golden rubles. And I think t
hose who came  back pretty rich, they were told 

by the Germans to collect  the bodies, and I think th
at™s when they got into that. That wasn™t a 

story with life certificates, that was a story wh
en people were -- ma de-believe that they™re going 
to Vilnius ghetto and at the last mo me nt they we
re told that™s what™s going to be then, you not -- 
Q: So they -- they weren™t shot at 
Paneriai, they were shot at Oshmena? 
A: No, they were -- Oshmena [i
ndecipherable] they did, yeah. 
Q: And your father wasn™t involved in any of that, then. 

A: Oh, he didn't know. He didn't know. See, they
 do -- they did exactly the same  thing with 
Kaunas. Father checked very carefully through 
Lietukis [indecipherable].They were going to 
bring a transport to Kaunas. Fath
er checked on the offices of s upp
liers of food whether it™s really 
going to happen, and he was assured by the Lithuani
an officials, yes, we had an order for bread, 
we had an order for potatoes, we had an order fo
r this, for that. This is for that addi tional 

transport to Kaunas. And when they were in th
e Vilnius railway station, 
Father overheard an old 
Polish railway worker that
 we™re changing the -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
110 
 
Q: Railway lines? 
A: -- rail -- railway lines. So 
he said, what do you mean you™re 
changing the railway lines?  He 
said well, we™re not going to Kaunas, we™re going to [indecipherable] to 
Paneriai. So at that 
mome nt, Father said he 
understood what™s going on. 

Q: And -- and that was? 

A: And that was -- I don™t -- you 
know, it -- it™s been 
so long, now I don™t reme mber whether this 
was -- whether this was the people around the top in Oshmena, or 
that was another German trick. 

Could be that could have been the Oshmen
a people who were supposed to go to Kaunas. 
Q: How -- how did people in the ghetto, as far as 
you are able to tell, how 
did they look at your 
father?  How did they evaluate your father? 

A: You know, in ghetto they used to say, look at 
commandant™s face when he is on the street. If 
the commandant is smiling, you know that no akti
ons are comi ng forth. If the comma ndant has a 
-- 
Q: Scowl. 
A: -- it™s -- yeah, scowl, you know that it™s 
not good. And I -- I would 
say that they took 
everything at a stride. They knew that he is tr
ying his best. You -- it™s 
-- as much as a human 
person can do, he tried. It -- you know, there was a -- 
we had a performe r. He had a, like a little 
song, a [indecipherable]. They -- li --
 life certificates were
 white, then they turn
 yellow, then they 
turn pink, ma ke sure they don™t turn red. 

Q: Can you sing the song? 

A: No. 

Q: Do you reme mber it? Do you just reme mber the words? 

A: That -- it™s a -- it™s a jet -- oh ye s -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
111 
 
Q: That™s okay. 
A: -- but it was in the Russian language. 

Q: It™s okay. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: But the -- go -- 

Q: How doe s it go? 

A: [speaks Russian]. The thing is that Father 
tried to get from Ger mans permission to employ 
people inside. And he told the Germans that he 
needs some  kind of paper to give those people. 
Not the yellow scheins to work outside, but some
thing so that people would have some thing in 

their hands to give them more hope. And the Germans agreed, so they printed the pink scheins. 

And they were -- 

Q: Certificates. 
A: Certificates, right. So he tried whatever was po
ssible to keep their spirit
 alive. At -- it™s not so 
easy. Now, the question of theater, for example. 
From the beginning it was very, very negative. 
How can you have theater and concerts in 
a place which is actually a ceme t ery? 
Q: And -- 
A: Where so ma ny of our people ha
ve died, or are being taken to 
die?  But after awhile, I think 
the human nature wants to look more -- towards 
more positive and more 
opportunistically. You 
couldn™t get a seat in the hall. 

Q: Did you used to go to the performa nces? 

A: Absolutely, everyone, absolutely everyone. So -- 

Q: And was this your father™s
 idea, to start the theater? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
112 
 
A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. The very first -- the very 
first one was in a room about the size I would say 
like this, towards that br oom, that size. It on
e -- one of the rooms we
re the admi nistrative 
building. My mother was so against it, you have 
no idea, but she couldn™t talk him out  of. They 
said, look Elenka, we need some thing to give the 
people. Let™s try it. And in that room they had 
like little pieces. One would si
ng, [indecipherable] Rosenthal, she sang, and the Fima  Shapiro, 
Marek Shapiro. Adriana -- little sketch, little 
pi eces. And it was tremendous success. But the 
opinion in ghetto was awful, look at that. Th
ere were not ma ny, I would say no more  than 30 
people attending, and it was just fo
r the admi nistrative apparatus. 
And after that he discussed it 
with other people who were in that
 line of work before the war a
nd they decided to start. And it 
started, and the success was tremendous, just tremendous. 
Q: What were your mother™s objections? 

A: My mother™s objections?  Her objections wa
s exactly the same  way. You don™t open a theater 

in a cemetery. She™s -- she™s -- she™s -- figured th
at it would be too painful for people who lost 
fa mily me mbers, which -- which I completely agr
ee. But in retrospect when I look back, I see 
that that gave people a lot of positive thi
nking towards the future. You go to a symphony 
orchestra, you know, you relax, whichever country you are. Especially in ghetto conditions. Wa s 

a very good symphony orchestra until Luba Levits
ka was int -- killed. She was a very good 
singer, and the drama actors were very good. So th
at it -- it worked out, it worked out to the 
benefit of people. 

Q: In general, I™d like to, in the next tape, talk
 a little bit more about your mother™s activities 
during these two years of the ghetto, from 1942 til 
1943, but we can keep that for the next tape , 

right? 
End of Tape Seven 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527

Beginning Ta pe Eight 
Q: It sounds from your telling that your mother wa
s still very integral in your father™s life, even 
when he mo ved into the ghetto and she was not 
known a mi -- at least am
ongst the Gentile, and 
certainly the ge -- German admi nistrati
on that she is his wife. Was that so? 
A: That™s so. 

Q: Did he used to come  back to the apartmen
t that you had an awful 
lot?  Was he able to? 
A: At four o™clock in the afternoon. 

Q: Every single day? 

A: When the things were quiet, every 
single day. That™s where Panana −ima it
¡
 would come  in at 
the same  time to get her ration of food -- 

Q: I see. 

A: -- for the people upstairs, and well, influence. Fi
rst of all, influence -- 
fi rst of all, he didn™t 
listen to her when she begged him not to get invol
ved. That™s the influence ended. Oh well, what 
can you do it?  Otherwise, they always conferre
d, they always discusse
d. Whatever was going on, 
they always discussed. Mama  was a  very intel
ligent and clever person, 
and she -- she felt his 
pain, and she felt his inability to do more than
 he can do. And for a wife to watch her husband 
being torn to all sides, it™s very difficult. On 
one of those awful nights 
of Oshmena, Mama  woke  
up in the morning, her hands were covered with a 
-- like a scale, from nervous tension. Both 
hands were covered. And she was a very sens
itive person, nervous te
nsion. And she could 
predict, in a way, things. And my father was 
aware of her knowing what is going to happen. In 
1939, I believe, there was a reunion of Lithuanian 
officers in Vilnius. And my father knew that 
Mama  want ed to see a Talmudist in Vilnius, b
ecause in Kaunas everybody was speaking, there is 

a fa mous Talmudist in Vilnius. And he told he
r look, I™m going to the conference, don™t you dare 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
114 
 
to go and see that Talmudist. Don™t you dare. Ca
use Father was not one of those people that, you 
know, believes in this or that. When he returned
 from the conference, he had one look at my 
mother and he said, you didn™t lis
ten to me . You went to see the Talmudist. Now, I don™t know 
how to explain it, but the Talmudist told my mo
t her everything that happened. They didn™t say 
the word Germans, but he described the awful th
ings that are going to happen and he told her 
that in a couple of years afte
r that, she™ll lose her husband. Talmudist had no idea who she is, 
who my father is, that her hus
band is Jewish. Absolutely no idea. He read Talmud. So when 
Father returned home from the conference, look
ed at my mo ther, he 
knew right away. And 
Mother lived with that heavy burden on her 
chest all these years, from ™39 to ™43. 
Q: And she never told him what he to
ld her -- what the Talmudist to -- 
A: She did, my father laughed. But he told her,
 I warned you, please don™t go. Cause he knew my  
mother was a very sensitive person. I told you about
 the scales overnight. He told her not to go 
because to hi m that was a laughabl e object. To her,
 that didn™t disappear. And she lived all these 
years waiting and expecting some thing terrible
 to happen. And Talmudist didn™t know how to 
put it. 

Q: It was 1939. 

A: ™39, yes. But he said, thi
ngs are going to be awful beyond description, and you lose your 
husband couple years after that. So you know when
 you live it was a feeli
ng like this. My mother 
hated the Germans to the point that when we were forced to live in Munich in one apartment, she 

never talked to the Germans.  

Q: This is after the war. 

A: After the war. We ll, I wanted to go through 
German consulates to look, ma ybe I could find 
out some thing about We iss, about Murer, abou
t Neugebauer, people th
at they thought -- she 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
115 
 
didn™t even want to hear anything 
about them. Her hatred is not a 
human hatred. I-It™s difficult to 
describe. And when my mother fi -- found out a
bout my father™s death, was already probably 40 
-- end of ™44. She went to Kaunas from where we were staying, and the landlady of my aunt™s 
house didn™t know that Mother doesn™t know. We liv
ed in the hope that ma ybe he ran away, or 
ma ybe -- whatever, but not dead. And she star
ted to, oh, poor Mrs. Ge
ns, oh my symp athy, oh, I 
am so sorry. Mama  couldn™t understand what sh
e is talking about. And when Mama  fi nally 
grasped, she nearly went ma d. It was awful. The la
dy was telling me  later, said she hasn™t seen a 
sight like that in her life. Because it was shock plus she fina
lly realized what happened. She 
didn™t take too much activity in ghe
tto. First of all, Mama  -- I wasn
™t afraid, Mama  wa s afraid of 
the Germans, that can get caught in there. A
nd she would spend time with Grandmothe r, with 
Uncle, and we had very ma ny friends in ghetto, so
 she would visit. But sh
e didn™t take part in 
any admi nistrative or anything because, as I say,
 nobody from Ger man part knew that we exist. 
But she would attend, like I show you the picture, I 
showed the picture. But even in the picture, 
she bent down so you wouldn™t see her face. She 
didn™t want any documentation that there is a 
wife to the commandant. 

Q: What happened with your grandmother? 

A: They were -- that was the last. That was alre
ady after Papa™s death, th
ey were taken all to 
Paneriai.  

Q: So your grandmother is in Paneriai? 

A: In Paneriai. Now the aunt with
 a little girl, she tried -- Sala -- Salomon™s wife, she tried to 
save herself. The girl was ador
able. Big green eyes, blonde. She was dressed in a white fur coat. 
Tiny girl, two years old. And she put the girl on 
the ground and she tried to go to the other side. 
So I talked to survivors and they said that the German officer
 picked the child, was going around 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
116 
 
to say where is the mother of the child, where 
is the mother of the child?  And th-that Sonia 
couldn™t stand it, she -- she just
 broke down. She came to the German offi cer, took her child and 
went to the -- 
Q: To Paneriai? 

A: To Paneriai, yeah. 

Q: What was the girl™s name ?  

A: This one?  This one was Ivana and the one in 
Siauliai wa s Aviva. About the same age, both. 
Q: We ™ll get to Siauliai in a -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- in another -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- time . So -- and your Uncle Salomon wa -- 

A: Kloge. Kloge. 
Q: So your uncle was deported to Kloge -- 
A: To Kloge, after Father™s death. And what was 
interesting, when he was deported to Kloge, the 
train went via Siauliai and he was able to wr
ite a little note, throw it through the window. 
Some body picked it up and ran to the ghetto in Siau
liai. And the brother in 
Siauliai came  to the 
train, he was the head of ghetto 
in Siauliai. He brought Solomon some  clothes, some  food, and 
that was the last the two brothers me t. And that
™s was -- when Salomon told the Siauliai brother 
that my papa is dead. 

Q: So your -- Salomon knew -- 

A: So -- 

Q: You didn™t know, but Sal -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
117 
 
A: I didn't know sa -- 
Q: -- but Salomon knew. 

A: -- Salomon knew. They didn™t tell us. Theydidn™t tell. That™s whyI don™t even know the 

exact date. We always took the date as 23
rd
 of September. That™s what we  thought, but we don™t 
know. 

Q: When wa s it -- when was it that you found 
out?  Your mother found out through this lady in 
Kaunas. 

A: That™s when th -- when we found out.  

Q: Tha -- so that you found out the same  ti me . 

A: Yeah, mm-hm.  

Q: So your mother told you, or this lady 
-- you we re there when the lady was te -- 
A: No, no, I was in hiding. We  were both in hi
ding. But that™s also already 1944, I believe. So 
that that was already so far away. Mama  went to Kaunas. 
Q: That™s right. 
A: And that™s when she found out, and then she returned back.  

Q: And she™s the one who told you. 

A: And she™s the one who told me , yeah. But wh
en she returned back, you know wha t  she did? 
She sat in one corner, looked into the other 
corner opposite and woul
dn™t move. She wouldn™t 
move. Nothing ma ttered to her, nothing. 

Q: How did -- what were you thinking?  What were you -- how did you react to some thing like 

that? 

A: I think at my age you don™t react
 like my Ma ma reacted. I-I belie
ve that I kind of suspected it. 
You see, what happened, only the day when they to
ld us to leave the apartment and we went to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
118 
 
Panana −imait
¡
™s place, −imait
¡
 came back and she said, listen, th
e rumor in Vilnius has it that 
some body r a n away from Gestapo building and ther
e are guards around the area. So that kept me  
-- 
Q: Hoping. 

A: -- hoping that if whoever escaped the Gesta
po building, it would be my
 father. That™s -- but 
that took too long, when by ™44 we haven™t heard,
 because if he would have been alive there 

would be a way to -- to let us know or some thi
ng, so I started to lose my hope. But Mama  clung 
to it, that Papa ma naged to get s -- ge -- escape 
Gestapo and he is in hiding some where. He just 

cannot get in touch with us. See, 
that is -- that was her attitude. 
Q: Where did -- where di d Mrs. −imait
¡
 bring you -- or Miss −ima it
¡
 bring you, to get into 
hiding?  We  haven™t explored -- 

A: She didn't bring, she didn™t 
bring. We  went to −ima it
¡
. Panana −ima it
¡
 lived in the apartment 
which was used to -- as a lodging for people who worked for the university. 
Q: She lived in a dormitory. 
A: Dor -- like a dormitory, yes. And in same  apartment was a lady whose husband was a very 

high Soviet official in -- duri
ng the Soviet year. And the Germ
ans had a place for all wives and 
children of Soviet officers who didn™t ma nage to
 take their wives away. They didn™t do anything 
bad to them, but they were segregated from
 others. It was a house close to Hakapay. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And she was taken by director of Vilnius Un
iversity and placed in an
 apartment with −imait
¡
, 
illegally. So when we saw her there, 
Mama  said, you know what Panana −ima it
¡
?  I don™t feel 
very safe in here because of her. 
Because if Germans come  after her -- 
Q: They™ll find us. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
119 
 
A: -- they™ll discovered us. So −ima it
¡
 walked with us to a wife, Polish wife of another police 
officer, Mr. Alprin. And we stayed a 
couple of days with Mrs. Alprin. 
Q: So her husband was a ghetto police person? 
A: Ghetto police person [inaudible] 

Q: But she was a Polish Gentile? 

A: She was pol -- Polish Gentile. And after a couple of days, we fi gured, well th-this is the place 

t-to hide, because we didn™t know to what exte
nt the Germans are going to look for us. So we 
had the permissions for the train. We boarded th
e train and we had very close friends of my 
parents, that™s the people whos
e children were on the echelon to 
Siberia, and we thought we™ll go 
over there. That™s far away from Vi lnius, far away from Kaunas. On the train, when the 

gendarmerie came to check the documents, my mo
ther™s face went white. She didn™t know is it 
because they have to check everybody, or just
 us . And her face gave her away. The Germans 
probably didn™t notice, but the people -- 
Q: Next to her. 
A: -- sitting next to us notice
d. So the ma n who was sitting ne
xt to me  turned around to my 
mother and he said very quietly that, Madam, 
I see that you have some  very big problem and 
ma y I offer our house in Siauliai until 
you decide what you are doing?  They -- 
Q: Strangers? 

A: Strangers. They didn™t know who am I, w
ho Mama  is, or anybody. There was a curfew. The 
train pulled out late, ta -- five
 or six o™clock in the morning, 
you couldn™t walk. So we spent the 
couple of hours until the dawn, a
nd the cra -- curfew was away, a
nd he mentioned his name  and 
he said that we have a huge esta
te, past Siauliai. I™ll take you to the estate and then you™ll decide 
what you want to do next. No questions. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
120 
 
Q: So this was a train going fr om Vilnius to Siauliai? 
A: Yes. 

Q: You weren™t going back to Ka
unas, you were going to Siauliai. 
A: No, to Siauliai, Kaunas was too 
close. Everybody knew us in Kaunas. 
Q: Okay. 

A: When we  came to the estate we discovered -- 
well, we knew his name , he introduced himself. 
We discovered that family who knew who we are, a
nd they gave us, or actually him, a -- a horse 
and buggy and he took us to the estate where we 
stayed for two years in hiding. The first face, 
when I looked down from the buggy was my sport 
friend, in sports, a me mber of Lithuanian 
basketball national team, Shlupas. Uh-huh. I just 
looked at him, said [indecipherable] what are 
you doing here?  And he says to me , and what 
are you doing here?  He doesn™t know that I am 
half Jewish. And this is my mother, he says, Mr
s., what are you doing here?  So I said -- he was 
not afraid of me . So I said, I™m in hiding. How 
would we translate in [i
ndecipherable] the -- 
Q: Wi  -- uh-huh, he was sort of
 like the village elder.  
A: Village el der. The vi llage el der was his cousin, and he needed a place to hide not to be 

inducted into German working force. So he came  to
 his cousin. His cousin sent me  to the place 
where we were in hi ding, and that was the first face I saw. And Mama  was n™t very ha ppy about 

it, but I said, Mama , you don™t expect anything bad fr
om the family Shlupas. It™s too high in our 
society to do anything bad. 

Q: But she would have preferred 
some one who didn™t 
know you at all. 
A: Sh-She would have preferred, but I don™t thin
k he knew anything about 
me  besides my na me , 
last name and so on. So that -- to suspect anyt
hing, because de finitely my mother doesn™t look 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
121 
 
anything like a Jewish person. And he knew me  for 
years, we were together in [indecipherable]. 
The -- the -- the -- we had in Kaunas the [indecipherable] sports -- 
Q: A sports -- 

A: -- sports -- 

Q: A sports facility. 

A: -- facilities. So for years we were together 
in sports with him. I knew -- we knew each other 

very well. So, see that what happen. You never know whom you meet. 

Q: Right. 

A: So he stayed there for quite awhile with us over there, yeah. 

Q: And so this was a se -- you went firs
t to this person who was set on a train. 
A: On a train, right. 

Q: Saw that your mother was -- 

A: Yeah. 
Q: -- was beside herself. 
A: Beside herself, right. 

Q: Offered his services. 

A: Right. 

Q: But he recognized, or he was able to identify who you we re? 

A: No, nothing. 

Q: Nothing. 

A: Nothing. 

Q: And then who knew who -- you say when you™re gone to a certain estate. 

A: That was, if you know Lithuania, the Venslauskas family. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
122 
 
Q: I see. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: And they™re the ones -- 

A: That™s another known fa mily, yeah. 

Q: Okay. And they™re the ones who hid you for -- 

A: We™d stayed with them for awhile. 

Q: For awhile. 

A: And then he brought us to th
e estate where we  stayed, yeah. 
Q: I see, and you stayed out in the country then? 

A: In the country for two years, over two years [i ndecipherable] 

Q: And you were then closer to Si
auliai than you were to Vilnius? 
A: Closer to Siauliai, right. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: Right.  
Q: Before I leave the Vilnius ghetto and talk abou
t Siauliai, I™d like to as
k a few other questions. 
Were you familiar with -- did you know about the 
Resistance moveme nt that was forming within 
the ghetto?  Did you know any of the people who were in it? 

A: I knew only enough in case I am caught, not to
 give the infor mation, because there was 
always a possibility that Gesta
po ma y find out about us. Father 
was very, very careful. And I 
knew the fact, I didn™t know the name s. I knew,
 for example, in 1942, Father talked to the 
Germans and explained to them th
at ghetto has no way to heat 
the buildings and he asked for 
permission to send Jewish workers in faraway woods
 to cut the timber and bring it in ghetto, and 
finally je -- Germans agreed. That was a place 
where the mo veme nt started. A carriage would go 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
123 
 
with double floor, with people unde
r the double floor, to unload themselves, load the timber and 
that goes one back and forth. So I -- I spent c
ouple of weeks in that pl ace over there and I knew 
perfectly what™s going on. But if
 you would put me  at the wall and tell me I will shoot you if you 
don™t tell me, I wouldn™t be able to te
ll. Father was very careful. We  -- 
Q: So you knew perfectly what was going on -- 
A: Yeah. 

Q: -- but you had nothing you could say? 

A: No. 

Q: That sounds -- 

A: I didn™t know the name s. 

Q: I see. 

A: You wouldn™t -- you wouldn™t me
ntion the name s. I knew the f
act because I was spend my 
time over there, I went with him over there.
 I knew -- I knew the extent what™s going on. 
Q: So in other words, he was also 
supporting the resistan
ce by doing this. 
A: He was -- well, you -- you™ve seen the litera
ture. They have all kinds of -- all kinds of 
opinions. They -- on one side they say that you 
are supporting, that he 
was procuring the guns. 
On the other side they s -- would say that he
 didn™t want them to leave ghetto, to leave the 
children and old people alone, because if you 
-- let™s say you saved hundred people in wood, you 
left the others for their own what?  They can™t
 do anything. Children, old ladies, women. He was 
against young people completely leaving the old 
ones in ghetto without any defense. He thought 
that there should be -- ther
e should be some thing left. 
Q: But it goes against what you were saying earlier -- 

A: Well, that ™s -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
124 
 
Q: -- when he chose the -- the young to live -- 
A: Ye -- he chose the young to live, but you s
ee, circumstances change, and when you see old 
mothers and mothers and grandmothers and little
 children and everybody tr
ies to get into the 
forests and leave them behind, I-I 
don™t think you can st
ick any more to -- to your ideas that you 
had before. He was telling them 
nicely that listen, I am warned by the Germans that if they find 
out who brings the guns, who goes away, the repe rc
ussi ons will be very bad, and they threatened 
the children. Th -- Papa did everything in his for
ce not to sacrifice the children, and the children 
were not touched until Pa pa was alive. He asked 
them to be careful, and he tried to explain to 
them that by removing a dozen today, dozen toda
y, dozen tomorrow, we cannot save the ghetto. 

He wanted to prolong -- you see, 
the front was moving slowly. It wa
sn™t as rosy for the Germans 
as it used to be in ™41. In ™
43 the situation in the fr ont wa
s already different. He was hoping 
against hope that ma ybe some how, if he drags th
e people longer, like in Kloge where my uncle 
died, the Russians were right ther
e. They came in, the timber was still burning, you see?  So he -- 
he just thought that ma ybe, ma ybe, if we don™t 
provoke the Germans, if they leave us alone and 
let us live the way we are, work, work, wor
k, work, nevermind work, but work, ma ybe we™ll 

expect -- you know, ma ybe our expectations w
ill take pl ace. Maybe it™ll happen. Maybe the 
Russian army will come closer. 

Q: Did he ever have a conversation with you as
 his daughter of, I ma y 
not survive the war? 
A: No, never. He knew it very well. He knew th
at the German could -- a German sol dier came 
into the ghetto area and he wanted to rip a -- Fa
ther had a -- a Lithuanian 
officer™s c -- student -- 
student -- like we have he
re, those [indecipherable] 
Q: Insignias -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
125 
 
A: Insignia, yeah. And Father di
dn™t want to give it to him. He pulled out the gun. So, there was 
no way, you know, he had to give it to him. And an
 officer could have shot him any time, any 
German could have shot him any ti me. We  -- we
 -- we counted on it, we knew it. So, I mean, 
there was no sense to di sc uss at all. What se
nse did it ma ke? We  knew the way he -- he lived. 
Q: You say that he was very careful to not talk 
to you about some thing that
 could eventually hurt 
you and hurt others, were you caught, where you would be forced to talk. 
A: That™s correct . 

Q: And yet, at the same  time, every day four 
o™clock, he™d come  back to your apartment -- 

A: That™s right. 

Q: -- and he would share things 
with your mother. Do you think the same  rule applied with her, 
or do you think he went into deta
ils with her, because he needed to talk to some body who was 
trusted?  

A: I would say the same  rule. I wou -- I -- I wa
s always there, so whatever I heard, she heard. 
There was no secrets without me  being present. 
You know, all -- all 
the effort that he put into 
that period of life was to prolong, some how, the su
rvival. Whatever he did was for that one and 
only purpose. We  have no idea, as I told you be
fore, we have no idea what the Germans di-
discovered, or simply they decided that he is the 
head, he should be removed, it™ll be easier to 
annihilate the others. 

Q: So -- 

A: For example, he built ma lin
as. You know wha t  ma lina is? 
Q: Secret places. 

A: Secret places. In charge of malinas were tw
o pe ople, engi ne er Marcos and Mr. Dellwell. Mr . 
Dellwell was from Kaunas. He knew him very well 
because his daughter was 
with me in school, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
126 
 
and engineer Marcos was from Poland. It was in 
engineer Marcos™ hands to
 build the malinas. It 
was in Mr. Dellwell™s hands to supply water 
and food. This we knew. Mama  knew a nd I knew 
that they are in charge. I didn™t know where the 
ma lina was, but I knew that Father had a plan, 
had quite a big plan for ma linas. 
And I believe what people told 
me , that my uncle™s wife and 
grandmother and the child were in the ma lina.
 But the Germans forced people to open the 
ma linas. So some  were saved and some  were pul
led out. But his idea was to do as mu ch as 
possible, to save as much as possible. So it™
s -- it™s not like you some
ti mes read, cooperation, 
what kind of cooperation?  He would go into [inde
cipherable] with the Germans. If the y would 
say they want 5,000, he would offer a thousand and the Germans would come  down to 3,000, he 
would s-say 1,500. But he was able, he ma naged to 
have that -- I think bi
lling -- being such a 
military nation, the Germans had certain -- I woul
dn™t call it respect, but
 they had a certain 
attitude towards a military posture of my fa
ther. He looked a military ma n whichever way you 
looked at him, from the left, or to the right. 
He looked a military ma n. And when the ma il used to 
come from Gebiets commi ssariat, mail, they would 
never write to Jewish, they would write Herr 
Jacob Gens. It was unusual to have such a polite 
form. I think that had a lot to do. And we were 
told that when Papa went into Gestapo and th
e army found out, well I don
™t know whether that™s 
true or not, the army offe red Gestapo two -- 
End of Tape Eight 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
127 
 
Beginning Ta pe Nine 
Q: So your father is arrested a
nd you heard later that the -- that th
e German army mi ght have -- I 
mean a rumor -- 
A: Might -- 

Q: -- that  a -- 

A: There was a rumor that the German army offe red Gestapo a tremendous amount of money to 

let my father go. Not because of sentimental reason
s, but he was a organi zer of entire product -- 
productive, you know, force for the German ar my, a
nd army needed it. But unfortunately the -- 
Hitler™s line was stronger and they -- 

Q: We ll, so what you said earlier
 about the Gestapo being corrup
tible, wasn™t always the case. 

A: That was not the Gestapo, that
 came  straight from Hi mml e r. 

Q: I see. 

A: That came from the up, up, up.  
Q: That it™s time for Gens to go? 
A: The Jewish solution, yeah. It™s time to finish with the Jews -- 

Q: I see. 

A: -- in Vilnius. Time  to fi nish with the Jews. So
 they didn™t care that army needed them. They 
didn™t want  any more Jews. The only place that 
they left for time being was the Hakapay at 
Kilus. Kilus was producing a fur uniforms for the 
German lady -- fema le personnel, and also for 
German offi cers, and later on for German ar my, 
what -- as much as they could. And Hakapay 
was involved in structural work, so -- 

Q: What is Hakapay, what was Hakapay? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
128 
 
A: I don™t know the German word -- n-name of 
Hakapay, I can find it. It™s what™s called H -- 
Hakapay, HKP. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: I -- I™ll find out what i-it meant. 

Q:  But  t h ere was al so effort  -- 

A: The Jewish -- they were out of ghetto. They
 we re living separately, out of ghetto, in the 
vicinity where the Russian wives 
and children of Russian officers were there -- where they were 
there. And they had the -- they didn™t belong to
gether, they always were separate, and I don™t 
reme mber which one went first, because I wasn™t
 there, whet her Kilus 
went first or Hakapay 
went first, they were not able
 to -- to save them. So -- 
Q: So you didn™t know of the details of resistan
ce activity in Vilnius 
ghetto. Did you know of the 
incident  as --  as it happened, of Vittenberg, or Wittenberg? 

A: Yes, I knew, that I knew. 
Q: Okay. 
A: That I knew. 

Q: What did you know of that, and what did you 
see or experience that surrounded the head of 
the resistance and his -- 

A: Father wa rned his people to be very carefu
l with Polish people arou
nd. He never trusted the 
Polish people, I™m sorry to say that. One reason 
was, he didn't  know them. Another reason was 
that he saw too ma ny Jewish
 people disappear in Lukiık
¡
s, because the Polish people will give 
them out. So he said, be very careful. Don™t 
ever trust a Polish person. I don™t reme mbe r  the 
details now, but some how Ger mans, I believe, ca
ught a Polish person and under torture he gave 
name . And the Germans requested to 
be handed in [indecipherable] yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
129 
 
Q: So this person --  so he gave the name of [i ndecipherable] Wittenberg? 
A: Yes, Wittenberg. It was an awful case because 
Papa tried to assure the Germans that ther e is 
no illegal activity in ghetto. Because they were 
threatening all the time , if we catch illegal 
activity, that will be the end of the ghetto. Now 
we all knew that Gest apo had means to tortur e 
and the -- the Polish ma n didn™t -- wa s not able to 
stand it, Wittenberg wouldn™t be able to stand 
it either . Now if they got Wittenberg and he would start talking, that was very bad for the ghetto. 

I can™t reme mber who gave him ciancarli. 

Q: What™s ciancardi? 

A: The very strong poison like 
Goering took?  Goering™s wife. 
Q: Cyanide? 

A: Cyanide, yeah. Can™t reme mber now. Even 
when I read those books 
years, years ago, I -- I 
don™t reread them all the time. I can™t reme
mber, but anyway, he was given ciancarli. 
Q: Did you know Wittenberg?  Had you seen him ever? 
A: Probably. A -- you know Wittenberg, Wittenber
g. He -- he -- nobody knew anything, so Mr. 
Wittenberg, that™s it. So he wasn™t given a life. 
Q: So in other words they handed over a corpse. 

A: Corpse. 

Q: And how do you know that? 

A: Oh that -- that was -- everybody knew that. 

Q: So that was written, or  that  was -- that was at  the time. 

A: That was at the time, yeah. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
130 
 
A: But Papa couldn™t afford to have Wittenberg
 tortured, because then the whole thing would 
slowly come  out. The forests, they™re going 
to the forests with 
a double bottom to, you know, 
carriage -- 
Q: Did he talk about that at home during his 
four p.m. meetings, you know, when he™d come  
back every -- 

A: About Wittenbe
rg™s torture -- 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Yes. It was very, very difficult story for hi
m. But what do you do?  You can™t risk -- that™s 
what he was trying to tell those people, I canno
t risk the entire ghetto 
because 20 or 30 of you 
would run to the woods and leave me  with a 
whole -- thousands on my ha nds, so that you are 
going to be fr ee. You see, the situation changed. 
Situation changed and he saw that there is no 
way -- if Wa rsaw ghetto, with such tremendous, or
ganized uprising didn™t 
survive, he knew that 
Vilnius can™t -- Vilnius doesn™t have so ma
ny a mmunition or anything. You -- you can™t -- you 
can™t survive. 

Q: So, but it was an argume nt then, that he
 must have had, a very strong argument and a 

longstanding one with those who 
wanted to resist, the young peopl
e who wanted to resist and 
belong to that resistance move me nt. 

A: That™s all right? They wanted
 to resist, and what about the 
others? What about this -- the 
aftereffect?  Okay, they would resist, let™s say 
they would fight for a week. There™s no question 
that the Germans would send their army and that
 would be squashed out. But what about the 
rema ining ones?  What about the rema
ining ones? Straight to the ovens? 
Q: It sou -- it sounds like he was caught in s -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
131 
 
A: He was caught, yeah. What would you do?
 How -- how would you -- how would you reason 
with people?  He knew that the young ones wants to
 save -- they want to save themselves, but 
what do you do with mot hers and grandmothers a
nd so on?  Father was counting that maybe one 
day the ar my, Russian ar my will come cl
oser, and the Germans will run away.  
Q: When did you a -- he sounds extraordinary. 
A: I would sa y not because it™s my father, but I would say that he was extraordinary. He was. 

Absolutely no fear. Absolutely no fear. 

Q: But did he have fear for you and your mother? 

A: Yeah. That™s why c-certain things you wouldn™
t tell. You -- I would 
know the facts, but I 
wouldn't know the name s. Because, you see, in
 Kaunas the Nuremberg law was applied right 
away. Some how in Vilnius, between Polish, Lith
uanian and Jews and this and that, it didn™t 
come  on the poles. So -- 

Q: You me a n, you didn™t see these Nuremberg laws pasted -- 
A: No, pasted i-in Vilnius. In Kaunas, yes. A
nd Kaunas had quite a few suicides, when one side 
wouldn™t give the other one away
 and both would commit suicide. 
Nothing like that in Vilnius. 
So -- you know, but you never knew when it will st
art. That™s why he was always very much 
afraid.  
Q: What legacy has he 
left you?  Your father. 
A: What legacy? 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: You know, he tried to help people. I™ve b
een helping people since 1947. He never got 
anything for his help. I never askanything for my  help, and I -- I 
help a lot. I think this is 

some thing that goes through the genes. You are 
the way you are because of some thing. You™re 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
132 
 
not the way you are that suddenly 
[indecipherable] oh, it™s good to 
ma ke good, and this and that. 
You are the way you are. And I believe a lot of 
that behavior had tremendous influence on my 
growing up -- in my growing up years. He used 
to say -- he had a saying in Lithuanian that 
[speaks Lithuanian here]. In E
nglish it would be, the dear Lord 
is getting old, and doesn™t see 
what™s happening on the earth. But he never comp
lained, he never blame d, he just took it in 
stride, whatever the life was throwing at him.
 And he had a very easy way not to do it. The 
Lithuanian officers had the place for him. It was 
a estate of Pulkanika Skorupskas. Just go and 
stay there. Nobody would know, that™s why Mama wa
s begging him, don™t get any official place. 
We have a place for you, we™ll wait until the end of 
the war, and that™s it. But you see, certain -- 
certain forces in your conscience overpower you, and 
even if he wasn't  Jewish up til that time , he 
felt for his nation, and he -- he wouldn™t budge.  

Q: Do you think people have been too hard on him?  

A: You want to know my answer?  
I couldn™t care less. That™s my answer , I couldn™t care less. I 
would like to have them just s
it in his skin and do what he 
did. Telling you™re going to die, 
telling you™re going to live. That™s
 easy on a person?  They show 
in those plays, they show a 
scene, they describe  a scene. Father st anding at 
the gate, and the German is letting father, mother 
in to children. And he sees a family comi ng with 
three children and he sees a fa mily comi ng with 
one child. And he grabs a kid from t he three, throws
 them into the family with one, hits the father 
on the shoulder with his stick and yells at him,
 what do you do?  You left your child behind. We ll 
that story is all over the plays, 
the books and so on. His mi nd had to
 work in all directions. If he 
wouldn™t have noticed that one has one child an
d the other has three children, the one would go 
through and they would take another third child fro
m the next. He had to see everything. It™s not 
so simple. And it™s not so simple to -- to ha
ve conversations with the Germans when you have 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
133 
 
huma n blood to count. As I told you, they want 5,000, you offer a thousand. They go down to 
four, you go up to one -- 1500. These are people, these aren™t just ma rionettes, and you have to 

deal with it. So I would like t
hose people who have harsh words to 
try to be in his skin and see 
how they would like to do it. That
™s why I say I couldn™t care less 
at all, cause I™ve seen my 
father™s reaction and I™ve seen hi
s tremendous e ffort to do whatever
 is possible. And he -- in the 
certain way the effort worked out, quite a bit 
survived. Not necessarily
 -- not necessarily in 
Vilnius but they survived in Dachau, they su
rvived in Auschwitz. So
me  survived. So, you know, 
it™s difficult -- difficult to ma ke
 a judgme nt. And now what can 
people -- they judge harsh -- 
harsh behavior at the gate. I explained to you th
e gate. Kaunas had completely different situation. 

Vilnius had completely different situation. Kaunas 
didn™t have to feed the people, we  had to feed 

the people. So, you do some thing to do it. He ha
d Polish people around, which he didn™t trust. 
Kaunas didn™t have it, Ka unas had 
Lithuanian people. So he had 
here the Germans on one side 
and he had untrustworthy Poles on the other side
. So h-he™s -- find th
e gold me dium. You were 
afraid of the Polish population, which was not frie
ndly at all, not friendl
y at all. He had an 
agreement with Gestapo. The Jewish person ha
d a Polish family, friends. The Jewish person 
would leave his gold for the Polish family to save
 for him. And then one day they would agree 
that the Jewish person somehow will come in th
e dark to get so me  of the gold. And the Polish 
person would call the Gestapo, and 
the Jewish person would come  i
n, and pick up the Jew, here 
we go to Lukiık
¡
s. And that happened time and again, time
 a nd again. So Father ma de the plan. 
He offered Gestapo 50 - 50. I™ll tell you where the gol
d is, you take 50, I take 50 percent. No Jew 
goes to Lukiık
¡
s, no Jew is shot in Paneriai. You have 
your share, I have my share for the ghetto. 
You had to buy food. Food was at exorbitant pr
ices, you needed money. So you figured, what 
I™m losing? One way or the other, the Pole wi
ll ca ll Gest apo to get the Jew, the gold will go 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
134 
 
hundred percent to Gestapo. This way at least 
I™ll have 50 percent for Jewish ghetto. And the 
treasury in ghetto will not be bare, will have 
some thing. We ll these people -- these people don™t 
know it, see?  He had to -- it was a Machia
velli scheme , but it worked. Everybody was happy. 
Gestapo was happy, and Jewish treasury was happy. 
Q: The Pole wasn™t very happy. 

A: The -- th-the -- that was not my fa ther™s conc
ern, you see?  If the -- if the Polish people kept 
the same  attitude, greedy people, people who were friends before, just because it was financial 

benefit involved, he didn™t care 
about it. So you see, things like
 this, they are not in the books. 
People who wrote all those articles we re happy 
to have food. And they were happy when they 
saw Comma ndant werk -- walking around the str
eet aw -- in a good -- in a mood. The y were 

happy at that time. We ll, he -- he wanted -- he wa
nted to live, but I™ll you
 again -- you me ntioned 
about his father in Siauliai, I th
ink if he would have lived, his fa
te would be even worse than his 
brother™s in Siauliai, from the 
Soviet Union side. Because in a
ddition of being the head of the 
ghetto, he wa s anti-Soviet, with all 
I told you before. So I think if 
my uncle was sent to Vorkuta, 
he would have -- probably didn™t even reach Vorkuta. He would be finished before Vorkuta. 

Q: Let™s get to Siauliai. 

A: Oh yeah. 

Q: How is it that your uncle, Ephrai
n Gens, got to be the [indecipherable] 
A: Coincidence, we didn™t know a thing. 

Q: It wasn™t -- it wa
sn™t in any way -- 
A: No way. Absolutely not connected. Very en
ergetic, very good looking, tall, blonde, blue-
eyed. Didn™t look like a Jew at al
l. I -- I saw your picture. 
Q: You showed me  the pictures. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
135 
 
A: He had -- I showed you the picture. He didn™
t look like a Jew at all.
 Product of Lithuanian 
schools, Lithuanian university. Energetic person. Pru -- 
Q: When did you learn he was a ghetto po
lice chief?  When you were in Vilnius? 
A: When we  were in Vilnius, yeah. 

Q: So --  

A: From my aunt.  

Q: From your aunt in Siauliai? 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: What -- did she have the right to come  -- 

A: No -- 

Q: No. 

A: -- no, no, no. 

Q: Did the brothers ever
 meet during that time? 
A: No, no. The only brother that me t [indecipherable] was Salomon on the way to Kloge, to 

Estonia. 

Q: So your father and Ephrain, in 
the times that they each were -- 
A: Had no idea. 

Q: They had no idea -- 

A: No idea, mm-h m.  

Q: -- that the other was the head 
of the police in 
the other ghetto? 
A: Mm-h m, mm-h m.  

Q: Not only did they not meet, they had no idea? 

A: No idea. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
136 
 
Q: When did you learn that he -- 
A: When I did learn?  When he came from Dachau. 

Q: So you were still in Lithuania when he came from Dachau. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: And can you give us just a brief kind of overvie
w of what his fate was, what his role there 
was, and -- 

A: All right. First it -- 

Q: And wha t  happened to Aviva? 

A: He had to hand it in, children™s 
section. That™s what my father didn™t live to see. One thing, he 

was protecting the children. And two, his moral satis
faction. He did not see 
the handing in of the 
children. They were taken out after his death. He
 was doing everything he 
could to protect the 
children. Every time the Germans wanted the chil
dren, he would offer some thing else. He si -- 
his brother couldn™t protect her 
daughter. He was commandant™s --
 chief of police daughter, so 
everybody knew. He had to ge-get her. What happene
d?  In -- when stut -- 
Stutthof was liberated, 
the Russians put German cows -- cows ma rching 
through Lithuania to Soviet Union. And they 
put the prisoners from St utthof in charge of th
e cows. And if you talk 
today to people in Kaunas 
my age, they will tell you how Kaunas looked when hordes of cows were going through our 

streets further towards Be lose. You have no idea. 
So, his wife was one of those prisoners from 
Auschwitz liberated -- 

Q: Stutthof. 

A: -- Stutthof, liberated, who was put in charge 
of getting the cows to Soviet Union. Na turally 
when they came to Vilnius she ran away -- well, 
they weren't prisoners an
y more -- she ran away. 
She knew where my aunt, my mother™s sister li
ved, and she came straight to my aunt, and she 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
137 
 
told us -- she told us everything. She told us how
 they had to give the child away, and she said 
that if her husband is alive, they agreed 
-- cause nobody could even f-fathom what will happen, 
but they agreed that they™ll meet in Lithuani a.
 They™ll look for each ot her in Lithuani a. So she 
stayed with us all the time. She was shaven, her 
hair started to grow, lit
tle by little. And one day 
the university choir had a concert in
 Vilnius. We came to Vilnius a
nd I we nt to visit my mother™s 
brother. 

Q: An uncle. 

A: An uncle. And when I knocked at the door an
d my -- his wife, my au
nt opened the door, she 
screamed in an awful way. I thought, oh my G
od, what happened, why is she screaming like 

that?  And then I looked deeper and I saw my Un
cle Ephrain sitting at 
the end of second room. 
She screamed -- and she told me  later that she di
dn™t know how to react. She was afraid of my 
reaction, at the same  time she couldn™t control hersel
f. So anyway, he sat in there, i-in the other 
room in a German uniform, cause he was six so
me thing. They couldn™t find him any clothes after 
Dachau so they dressed him in a German ar my
 wu -- uniform. Can you imagine, Soviet years, 
war is still going and I get to 
the street with a ma n in German
 uniform?  So anyway -- oh, that™s 
another thing, how we survived, we 
have to come  back to some thing. 

Q: We will. 

A: Anyway, Mama™s mi nistry of -- I think 
it was of -- [speaks foreign language here] 
Q: Commer ce. 

A: -- of commerce, commerce mi nistry had truc
ks going Kaunas Vilnius. So they gave us a 
truck. We  put my uncle at night in the truck a
nd we transported him from Vilnius to Kaunas. 
Now in Kaunas when we returned -- we had nothi
ng in Kaunas, but my aunt had an apartment. 
But because we -- we were cut off in the Samogitia place -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
138 
 
Q: Mm-hm, in [indecipherable] mm- h m.  
A: -- in -- in Lithuania, there 
were 30,000 of us were cut off, 
we returned to kow -- to Kaunas 
very late. And already in all the poles you coul
d read, if you don™t come  back by such and such 
date, the state will take over your apartments. 
That meant that wi -- 
if you are in Germany, you 
ran away, we™ll take over your apartment. But 
they gave a chance for the 30,000 to come  back. 
So my ha -- my aunts -- 

Q: The 30,000 refugees, the 30,000 who were hiding, the 30,000 Jews? 

A: The 30,000 who were cut off in Sa mogitia. 

Q: Okay. 

A: Cut off. You had Russians comi ng from this 
side, you are Germans arriving from this side, 
and you had 30,000 Lithuanians tr
ying to get some where. 
Q: I see, okay.  

A: So anyway, my -- my -- ma  -- my aunt™s landlady fi gured that pr obably my aunt will re turn, 
so she had no way to save her stuff, but she put her stuff into one room and gave her apartment to 
enkavadair lady worker. The KGB la dy worker. 
So now we can™t show my uncle. It™s one 
apartment. You know, you share the rooms, share th
e kitchen. It™s one apar
tment. So during the 
day he exactly sat behind a ta
ll wardrobe, without moving.  
Q: And the reason why is because he had only a German uniform on? 

A: He had a ger -- he had a German uniform, he
 c a me  from Dachau, explain to her, to a KBG 

lady. In uniform. She ha d the blue epaulets and ev
erything. So anyway, after 
awhile of staying in 
this arrangement, we had no place to sleep. My a
unt had only one little couch and one chair that 
you could open. And there was my uncle, his wife, 
Maba, Kata and myself, five of us. So they 
decided that the best thing fo
r them t o do would go to Klaip
¡
da. But at that time  Klaip
¡
da was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
139 
 
not open for private population because it was 
mi ned by the Germans when they ran. They 
mi ned every building. So the Russian forces were going from one building to another -- 
Q: Clearing it. 

A: -- removing the mi nes. 

Q: And this was a harbor town, harbor city. 

A: It was harbor city. So they said, when 
the mi ning period will be 
finished, they™ll go to 
Klaip
¡
da. Nobody knows in Klaip
¡
da the Gens name . They r ealize they cannot stay in Kaunas, 
Vilnius or Siauliai. 

Q: He had new clothes, 
I take it, by that point? 
A: Hm?  

Q: At some  point along the way -- 

A: No. No, not yet.  

Q: No?  
A: Not yet, not yet, not yet. So that™s what -- 
what was decided would be the best thing for him 
to do, to mo ve to Klaip
¡
da. And then slowly we started to gath
er things for him to take with and 
so on, and at one point naturally the clothes ha
d to be changed and the -- but what happened, 
when Dachau was liberated, he was appointed a 
head of German post office in Frankfurt.  
Q: How did that happen?  

A: Well, he tel -- 

Q: A for mer  prisoner of Dachau becomi ng -- 

A: Yeah, but that™s a -- Germany is no more. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
140 
 
A: Intelligent person, knew how to work, and he was in Frankfurt am Main, am Ode r , that was 
Frankfurt am Oder. He was head of the post office,
 but then h-he reme mbered that he ma de an 
agreement with his wife to meet in Lithuania if th
ey stay alive. So he said nevermind my post in 
the post office, I™ll go to Lithua
nia and I™ll see ma ybe I™ll find 
my wife alive. And that™s, you 
know, what happened. So we transp
orted him from Vilnius, from 
my other uncle™s home  to do 
this and later on -- you see that -- that will ma ke
 me  explain to you why we left Lithuania. 
Q: Okay, you can do that. 

A: We  have enough time to do? 

Q: We  got enough -- 
End of Tape Nine 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
141 
 
Beginning Ta pe 10 
Q: Okay. So your uncle at Frankfur
t am Oder reme mbers his promise to his wife, that if they are 
alive they meet back in Lithua
nia. He ma kes it back to Lithua
nia only in a German soldier™s 
uniform. 
A: Right. 

Q: By a mi racle doesn™t get arrest ed, doesn™t ge
t picked up. Is -- is transported surreptitiously 
from your mother™s brother™s, that 
is your uncle™s from the other side of the fa mily apartment in 
Vilnius, to Kaunas -- 

A: To -- 

Q: -- and eventually goes to -- 

A: Klaip
¡
da. 
Q: -- Klaip
¡
da. 
A: N-Now, I™ll explain to you wh
at happened with us. When we 
returned back from hi ding -- 
Q: And whe n did hiding end 
and how did it end for you? 
A: Soviet army broke through 
from Leningrad, Riga, pushed th
e Germans out, and we were on 
the way. 

Q: And do you reme mbe r  what it was lik
e seeing the first 
Soviet soldier? 
A: What it was like? 

Q: Yeah, well I mean, did you see them?  Did some body come  and tell you? 

A: Oh sure. No, no. 

Q: Okay. 

A: We were in the valley. 

Q: Okay. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
142 
 
A: On the other side of the valley was a high --
 not highway, but a road where the German ar my 
was running like crazy, because on the other side
 of the valley was a hill and you could see 
Russian soldiers, mounted soldiers with binoc
ulars watching what™s going on. So here is a 
picture. People in the mi ddle, Germans runni
ng away, not letting you on the road, because they 
had to run. Russians watching th
e whole scene and shooting with
 cartouches over our heads at 
the rush -- at the Germans. 
Q: [inaudible] 

A: Yeah. Now, these were the Russian troops, the 
frontier troops. Mama , in her wisdom told us 

look, we™re not waiting for the 30,00
0 people to be transported back to Lithuania, we™re leaving 
tonight. As long as we are dealing with frontier tr
oops, they are not going to
 be -- there won™t be 
any inquisition about our political views. As s
oon as the Russian troops go out and the civil 
governme nt sets in, we™ll start the same  thi
ng as we lived in 1940. Who are you, where are you 
and so on and so on. And Mama  was right, as al
wa ys. So, we asked the Russian echelons of 
soldiers, trains of soldiers, to help us to go b
ack to Kaunas. We explained that we™re refugees 
from the war, from the s hooting. So Mama, my un
c -- my aunt, who came to join us later in the 

hiding place, they transported us as far as Radvili
shkis. On the way there, more people joined the 
trai n and they started to tell that in Radvilishki
s, which was already in 
Soviet hands for quite 
awhile, there is already a KGB checking every 
refugee, his papers, and asking questions. And 
those people told us that, you know what?  You be
tter get, before Radvilishkis, off the plane, 
walk -- 

Q: Off the train. 

A: -- off the trai n, walk to Radvilishkis, go in a half circle and get another soldier™s train, jump in 

to go to Kaunas. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
143 
 
Q: By train do you mean an actual 
train on tr -- on 
railway tracks? 
A: On railway tracks, yes. 
Q: Okay. 

A: But the soldiers were comi ng from the front, back. 

Q: I see.  

A: So we did what the pe ople advi sed us, and we 
were in Radvilishkis, the three of us. We were 

on the street and then I see a ma n comi ng towards us. I say Mama , doesn™t he look familiar to 

you, I just can™t point -- how do 
we know hi m?  Mama  couldn™t reme mbe r . And then it dawned to 
me . After going to Palegise it was usually, we used
 to go to a big estate and spend another month 
in that es-estate, and he was the brother of th
e owner of the estate. Tall ma n, looked very much 
like my uncle from Siauliai. Silver hair, big, 
tall. So I approached him and I said, do you 
reme mber me and my mother?  He looked at 
my mother, he said, you know what?  I think I 
reme mber you from year after year staying at
 that estate. And he helped us to go around 
Radvilishkis. He put us on the next soldier train, and we escaped already the Soviet civilian 
authorities. Now again the same  thing when -- when
 we approached Kaunas, we told -- we were 
told get off the train little bit before. When 
the train stops, don™t go to Kaunas railway station, 
it™ll be even worse. Because Ka
unas already in Russian hands fo
r quite awhile. See, the area 
where we were was liberated onl
y in the si -- October, and Ka
unas was already liberated much 
earlier from the Germans.  

Q: So we™re talking October ™44. 

A: ™44. 

Q: And Kaunas was liberated probably 
in July or something like that. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
144 
 
A: Somewher -- something like th
at, you see. So that™s what ha
ppened, but we didn™t know what 
happened to my aunt™s apartment. So we walked
 to the apartment and that™s what we found. We  
found that she moved all her stuff to one room, let 
the [indecipherable] into her apartment, but at 
least she had one room. I n those days
 Lithuania had the cards for food. 
Q: Ration cards. 

A: Ra-Ration cards. I entered righ
t away the university. So we had 
cards better than the regular 
person. My aunt went back to work, she was 
a manager of Spodos Fondas. I don™t know if you 
know Spodos Fondas. It was a huge chain of -- like Plymptons in America. Stationery -- 

Q: Mm-hm. Oh yeah. 

A: Huge chain. She went back to Spodos Fondas.
 Now Ma ma  started to look for work. Wherever 
she went, the mo ment she filled out pa pers Gens [i ndecipherable] Mrs. Gens, nothing worked. 

We had [indecipherable] we had nothing. So, you 
know, I was pushed against the wall, I said, 
Mama , what  are we going to do?  On my student 
card and my aunt™s regular card, we™ll starve. 
It™s worse than during Ge rman occupation. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: There™s nothing to eat. I said, you know what
?  I™m going to Vilnius. I have to find some  
survivors in Vilnius, I™ll see 
what I can finally find out. To ma
ke a long story short, I go to 
Vilnius, and I knew that in every institution the 
Ka dros Kiros would be again in the hands of 
Jewish people. I go to one mi ni
stry, I open the door and were 
f-five of them standing. They 
couldn™t believe that I am alive. They said, Ada,
 you alive? What about mo
ther?  Said, Mother is 
alive. Said oh, we all knew that you are dead, 
both of you. Be cause we disappeared. See, we 
disappeared so quick that there was no time even to
 think otherwise. So I said, look, we  are alive, 
yes, but you know, we probably wi
ll die from hunger 
cause we have no money, nothing to sell, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
145 
 
and how do we survive?  So he said, oh, don™t 
you worry. I said Mama  was looking for a job, she 
speaks perfect Russian, when she men-me ntions 
her last name , nobody gives her work. So one of 
them said, you know what?  Don™t you worry. Mama  
come s to work for my
 mi nistry, I™ll he -- 
ma ke her a head of administrative si -- admi ni
strative de-department, and I™ll keep Mama™s 
dossier under key. And as long as I™m the ch-chief
, she -- her papers are in the si -- sealed, under 
a key. No problems. Wh en I came back to ha -- Kaunas, Mama said, how did you dare to do 
that?  You know that I don™t want
 to be a prominent person. I don™
t, you know, that I™d want to 
[indecipherable] anywhere. I sa
id, Mama , we have to eat. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: So either  or. Either  you will be a pr ominent person -- 

Q: And we™d eat. 

A: -- or we eat. 

Q: Yeah. 
A: And th -- that what we  did. Now, one day -- 
Q: So, which mi nistry wa s this part of? 

A: [indecipherable] mi nistry. 

Q: Commer ce mi nistry.  

A: Yeah. 

Q: Okay. 

A: Commer ce mi nistry. One da
y he pays us a visit. 

Q: In Kaunas. 

A: In Kaunas. 

Q: And who was this ma n? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
146 
 
A: He™s in Canada. Tevya Sheriss. He  said, Mrs.
 Gens, I have to tell you that I am not able to 
keep your papers under the key much longer, an
d I would advise you to do some thing about it. 
She looked at him and said, what do you mean? He said, I am Polish citizen. I am going to 
Poland, I™m repatriating to Poland, and I would a
dvise you to repatriate to Poland. Mama  looked 
at him, said, how can I repatriate?  I am Lithua
nian. I speak Polish perfectly, but I am not Polish 
and everybody in Kaunas knows who I am. So he sa
id, well, try to think 
of some thing. And we 
had in each location, a Polish repatriating comm
ittee. So repatriating committee would check 
your Polish ancestry, but then Lithuanian KGB had to
 stamp it. So it wasn™t so simple. So Mama  
-- we went to ma ny places in the area of 
Vilnius, where nobody knew who Mama  is. And we 
tried the Polish committees, to talk to them. 
They said fine, we™ll do it. Because Mama  had 

perfect documents from her high school and from
 work at the Polish refugee committee from the 
first war. And they said -- anot
her thing was, I spoke 
perfect Polish. So, no Lithuanians in those 
years spoke Polish. So she -- he -- she would tell
, look at my daughter. We ™re Polish people. But 
they said, what about the Lit
huanian?  You will not go through 
the Lithuanian KGB. So Mama  
came back to Kaunas and said, I don™t know what to do. There is no way to get official papers, 

and there is no way af-after he unlocks his [i ndeci pherabl e] and goes to Poland that  they will 

keep me  there. So, I don™t know who was the 
person to help us, but we went through Polish 
committee legally, absolutely. Now there was a 
question of getting Lithuanian exit stamps. 
Some body took the papers, some body did the work and some body got paid. And in our transport 

were all the workers of Kaunas th
eater. Ballerinas and drama, 
everybody was from the theater. 
At that time my uncle and his wife were still w
ith us, and Mama  said Froizim, how about we try 
the same  for you?  And he answered, Elenka, ther
e is no way. I am too -- too -- I -- I would show 
in between those people, I woul
d stand out. I cannot risk. I went through so much, I c a nnot risk 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
147 
 
to be caught at the border. Because we didn™t know the arrangement, was  it enough bribe, not 
enough bribe, will we go through?  Because we c
ould have been on one st retch to Sibe ria, 

crossing the Soviet border illega
lly. When we arrived at Suwalk
i and crossing bord -- crossing 
point, we see that were two young ladies, they went
 to -- with big baskets with everything in the 
basket, to the guards, and we see that they hand
ed the baskets and they returned to the -- ther e 
was three trucks -- two buses and 
a truck. And we see that they 
are lifting up the -- the -- the big 
wooden plank that crosses the border. We  enter Suwalki. We enter Suwalki and now, can you 

imagine, in the whole transport of our 
people, only Mother and I speak Polish. 
Q: And yet everybody™s a Pole repate -- repatriating to Poland? 

A: Right, right, to Poland, yes. 

Q: That™s a big bribe. 

A: Yeah, the big bribe. So anyway, Mama  looke
d around at [i ndecipherable] we can™t stay here 
very long, because if they catch -- the Poles -- 
Pole -- Polish were under the Soviet influence. 
Q: That™s right. 

A: We  can™t stay here very long. Let™s try and ge
t out as soon as possible.
 But was easy said, not 
so easy done. 

Q: So you wanted to abandon all thos
e drama and theater people from -- 
A: We -- we were -- yes -- 

Q: -- Kaunas. 

A: -- yes, yeah. Now what happened. My aunt 
was on the same  repatria
tion paper, there were 
three of us. And at the last day she said, you 
know what?  I am afraid. 
I™ll stay, I cannot go. 
Because 75 percent was doubtful and it looked that 
we may not cross the border. So she stayed 
behind. Now, that friend of mi ne, 
Mr. Sheriss, before he left  he 
gave us a name  and address in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
148 
 
Lódz and he told us look, you ge
t in touch with that person. Do 
you know what the Jewish aliyah 
is?  
Q: Isn™t that transfer to Israel?  

A: Yes. 

Q: Going to Israel. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Yes. 

A: From all over the world. He said, she is a lia
ison for Jewish aliyah and when you tell her who 
you are, she™ll help you to get out of Poland to ot
her destinations. So we come  to Lódz, we find 
the address and the lady who opened the door said, oh yes, she was in here, but about couple of 

weeks ago, she went west. That was our only co
nnection in Poland. She we
nt west. Ah, but she 
says, you know what?  There is a doctor from V
ilnius. He lives in the same courtyard. Dr. 
Roma nofsky. Go and talk to Dr. Roma nofsky, ma ybe
 he™ll know -- because she is from Vilnius, 
he is from Vilnius, ma ybe he™ll know where did she go. So Mama  stays in the mi ddle of the 

courtyard, I ring a bell to Dr. 
Roma nofsky™s door. The door opens up. Mrs. Feigenberg opens the 
door, and the German nurse stands behind he
r. And Mrs. Feigenberg [indecipherable] 
Q: A Ger ma n nurse? 

A: Yeah, worked for -- for her husband. 

Q: Okay. And this is -- 

A: This is already free Poland. 

Q: Free Poland? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Okay. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
149 
 
A: I understood imme di ately. I wa
s sent to see Dr. Roma nofsky 
and I found Dr. Feigenberg, one 
of the doctors that my father pulled forward to live
 in the hospital. He couldn™t live -- he couldn™t 
leave vil -- Lithuania, so he
 bought himself papers of a dece
ased Polish doctor, Romanofsky, 
with his diploma and everything 
and he arrived Poland illegally 
himself. The Russians wouldn™t 
let him go, a nd he lived in that apartment as Dr
. Roma nofsky. That™s when -- Mrs. Feigenberg, 
when she saw me , she almost shouting 
me  not to call her Mrs. Feigenberg. 
Q: And there was a German nurse behind her? 
A: Working for her. 

Q: I see. 

A: She was a German na tional. 

Q: I see, okay. 

A: She was working for her husband as a nurse. 
Not a German for -- but she was a German -- 
Q: I see. 
A: -- by -- by nationality. So anyway, you see, that was a split second. If I would have a 
blabbermouth, I™d say, oh, Mrs. Feigenberg, how 
nice to see you. That would have cut into his 

career. So now the Feigenbergs took us in and we
 stayed more than two months with them. And 
in the meantime the aliyah started working to get us out. Why did we go to Torun?  We  went -- 

when we left Lódz, we went to Torun. Duri
ng the German occupation, when it was quiet in 

Vilnius, when they didn™t round up, you know, the young people, I used to take English lessons 

from a Polish lady. And then you were -- we got ve
ry friendly. Her father
 was a director of a 
theater in Toruni. And some how she™s jokingly 
told -- said, you know, Ad
a what -- if you ever 
happen to be in Poland, if you ever happen to be cl
ose to Torun, come  and stay with us. I used to 
help them a lot. They were afraid to leave th
e apartment because of th
e [indecipherabl e] the -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
150 
 
the roundups. I used to go get food for them. So
 anyway, the relationship was very nice. And 
Mama  said, you know what?  We ™re sitting with th
e Feigenbergs already two months. How much 
longer can we sit?  They were very nice to us. 
In the meantime, they discovered that Mrs. 
Feigenberg™s deported parents surv
ived Siberia and are on the way 
back to Poland to join them. 
So we went to Torun and we started to ask wh
ere is the theater. We  
found the theater and we 
asked, by any chance is Mr. such and such with the 
theater?  They say sure, he returned back to 
his regular director of the theater.
 So we went to see -- to see th
em and we stayed with them for 
awhile. See, some ti me s, you know -- 
Q: That™s right, there™s connections.  

A: -- there™s connections, yeah. 

Q: Mr. Sheriss, before I reme mber -- before I 
forget, how did you know him in Vilnius, was he 
in the ghetto? 

A: One of the friends. 
Q: He was a friend? 
A: A friend of mi ne. 

Q: A friend of yours -- 

A: Yeah. 

Q: -- but was he in the ghetto? 

A: In the ghetto. 

Q: He was in the ghetto. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Okay, so you -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
151 
 
A: Well these -- that -- oh, the w
hole five or six, when I entered the room, they were all my 
friends from ghetto. And when I told them, look, 
we have nothing to eat, do some thing, so they 
said, let Tevka do it for you. He can do it. He is a 
big chief and so he did it, yeah. So now we 
were -- 
Q: In Torun. 

A: -- in Torun, and we followed now aliyah. There was a group, was supposed to go via Austria. 

Our group was supposed to go through five borders 
[indecipherable]. And we were placed -- we 
were brought to Berlin with a group of Jewishpeople and placed in the building for Jewish 

refugees. And while in that 
building, next day, Mama  said, 
you know, I don™t feel very good in 
here. We  are in the Russian zone of occupati
on. The Jewish people are already shu-shu-shu-shu-

shu-shu-shu, some thing is wrong with me  and you. 
They can see that I™m not Jewish and I don™t 
believe it™s safe for us to -- to be in here. Th
e ma n who was in charge of the group, his wife was 

eight months pregnant so he is
 -- was worried about his wife 
more than about the group, and I 
said Mama , we™ll have to do some thing, but I do
n™t know what, let me  think. What can we do?  
And I found out from the group th
at in the west Berlin there 
is a huge refugee camp, but huge, 
for thousands of people. And they were supposed
 to be transported to
 that refugee camp. But 
before to get to the refugee camp, you had to go 
in Berlin through Jewish committee to be issued 
a certain ausweis, a paper to s
how that you are 
a -- a Jews -- 
Q: Identification paper. 

A: -- I.D.. And when Mama  went to that place,they look at my mother and said, sorry, you don™t 

look Jewish. So I hoped that there was -- some body 
would be from Vilnius. I said, do you have 
anybody from Lithuania, from Vilnius in here? Th
ey said no, we don™t. So there was no way to 
say that I am Gens widow and daughter and so on, 
per -- they didn™
t know anything. So when we 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
152 
 
came back I said, Mama , you know what?  You stay here
. I™ll try to go to the 
west zone and see if 
I can get into that camp. Because it was too dangerous. We  ma de through so much, s o that 
suddenly, you know -- and I went to the camp, an
d I figured it™s no sense to talk to some  
employee. The director was American General Ta
ylor, not the fa mous Ta
ylor, another General 
Taylor and asked his -- I asked 
his secretary that I would like to
 talk to the director. And she 
looked at me , said well, young lady, you can sit and wa
it. I don™t know if he™ll be able to see you, 
but at least you can wait. I did wa
it probably three hours. I sat in 
the waiting room, finally he saw 
me . And you know wha t , it was nothing to hide. I 
couldn™t lie. I told him the truth. I told him 
about my fat her. I told the Jewish aliyah has do 
-- supported us as far as
 Berlin, but now we are 
stuck. We  cannot get Jewish I.D.. So the first 
reaction he said to me , you know young lady, this 
all sounds like a fairy tale. I sai
d, it sounds like a fairy ta
le, but this is truth. Because there was 
no way out. We were sitting in Soviet zone of occ
upation. So he said, don™t 
worry at all. Here are 
the two stickers. Go and get your mother, get 
her to the camp and here you go, we™ll transport 
you through Hanover to American zone and that™s th
e end of your problems. Now I c o me  back to 
the Jewish house. My mother is half alive. 
The ladies are putting he
r cold compresses on her 
head because I didn™t return for so many hours.
 Mother thought that maybe the-the Russian 
soldiers got me , or what ever. She is half dea
d. And I walk in, I says, Mama , don™t say anything. 
We didn™t have much, I had a rucksack and she ha
d a rucksack, it™s all we had. I said, take your 
rucksack, get slowly dressed and we™re getting out
 from here. She said, where to? I said, we™re 
all set, we™re going to that refugee camp. So, 
they didn™t see us walk out, you know, some how 
you find a mome nt when people are in another room
, we wal ked out. And we got to the western 
Berlin and we got into the camp. Na turally the 
first thing they did was put a DDT behind your 
clothes, but they gave us f
ood, place to live and everythi ng. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
153 
 
Q: So this is the first tim
e that you are not really unde
r any occupation in years. 
A: In years, right, yeah. But we -- we were st
aying in the Jewish house in the Russian zone. 
Q: That™s right. 
A: See, Berlin was, reme mber -- 

Q: That™s right. 

A: -- Russian, American, French and British. And 
a huge, huge truck trailer took us to Hanover. 

Q: What part of Berlin wa s 
this huge camp?  We st Berlin? 
A: Wa  -- wa -- that was in th -- in the American zone.  

Q: In Zehlendorf?  In -- do you reme mber? 

A: I -- I don™t know whether it was in Zehlendorf.
 I reme mb er the name  Zehlendorf, but I don™t 
know whether in connection with that 
or not. It wa s one treme ndous big -- 
Q: Ca mp. 

A: -- camp. They brought us to Hanover and when
 we disembarked in Ha nover, we were told 
that™s the British zone of occupation, that the 
Britishers are returning the bolts and the Soviet 
prisoners of war back to Soviet Union. And that 
already Soviet prisoners are war -- of war are 
committing suicide to the left  and to the ri ght because they know that thei r fate is going straight 

to Siberia. That wasn™t ve ry pleasant because
 we never expected that Baltic people would be 

returned to Baltic stat es. Now, Britishers were as naïve as Americans. They fi gured Baltic stat es 

are free, you -- you don™t have to be refugees -- 

Q: Go home . 

A: -- go be home . And while we were on the transport, some how a young ma n attached to us and 

he said, you know what?  I know somebody in Ham
burg. I™ll take you there and we™ll see what 
we can do further. So we  stayed with that lady, 
afternoon and then we went
 to the railway station 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
154 
 
and got into the transport of coal
, black coal. And we hid in that 
carriage with coal
 -- there was a 
-- you know, a transport that had a
ll kinds of me rchandise and they
 had coal in between. And we 
knew that nobody was going to look for us in that 
carriage with coal, and we went as far as 
Munich. 
Q: Wow, clear across the country. 

A: We  looked like a devil, black. When we arri
ved Munich -- and you know, this is some thing 
that goes from mouth to mouth, a -- a place wa
s called Deut sches museum, German museum. 
That was a center for all refugees in American 
zone. They used to come  for i-information and 
everything in that Deutsches museum. A -- 
End of Tape 10 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
155 
 
Beginning Ta pe 11 
Q: Okay, so now you™re in Munich. 
A: Now I™ m in Munich. 

Q: Covered with coal dust. 

A: Covered in coal dust. So we -- we di -- we 
wer -- were in gi -- a separate room, we™re -- we 
were directed to a big, huge room wi th people, 
but we had food, we had showers, we could wash 

u-up, we could change our cl
othes, we had alrea -- 

Q: And you had the stickers from Ge neral Taylor. 

A: And we had the stickers from Ge neral Taylor, 
right. But that was only ha
lf of the story. I went 
out to look for Lithuani ans because we were already 
out of the cl -- not clutches, but out of being 
supervised by aliyah. Their role
 was to bring us to west and 
we were already in west. So I 
stepped into the hole and then 
right in front of me stood two 
me n speaking Lithuanian. So I 
approached and I said, by any chance -- but you 
know, that™s a stupid, stupid question. I said by 
any chance do you know where the Venslauskas fa mily is in Germany?  So he turned to me , said, 

you know Panana, what?  If you wouldn™t have 
found us two here, you would never find out 
where they are. They are in a tiny farming villa
ge, living with a farmer. He  said, I can gi ve you 
directions how to reach them, and you can take 
a train up to a certain di stance, but from that 
distance you™ll have to wa lk about 10 kilome ters. 

Q: Oh my. 

A: Uh-huh. And there it was wint
er and I figured, well that™s th
e only way to reach. And these 
are the people who helped us escape. 

Q: They had helped you escape -- 

A :  R e me mb e r ?  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
156 
 
Q: -- when you had to hid -- hide -- 
A: Hide, and th -- 

Q: -- in ji -- in Zemaitji. 

A: -- that™s the people -- person who took 
us from the train to his estate.  
Q: I see. 

A: So now, okay, I take a train. Mama  stays safe 
now in the west and I disembark. The s -- name  
of the station was Donoverte. Hm, 10 kilome te
rs, 10 kilome ters, big deal. You know, you™re on 

skiing five kilome ters you don™t 
even feel it. I start walki
ng. I go, I go, and I see a German 
military camp. And [indecipherable] of the Germ
an military camp, you know, you have the s-sip 
-- open doors some wher e, I see German soldiers and the German ladies. So I went as fast I could 

around the camp, and I kept walking and a car 
stopped. He said, wher
e are you going?  Would 
you like a ride?  I said, I™m going to such and such 
village, the farming village. And he  said, who 
are you visi ting?  I said, I am visiting -- I want to
 find a Lithuanian family, and I me ntioned the 
name . Oh, he said, he lives with 
one of our people over there, so 
I™ll give you a ride. So he gave 
me  the last couple of kilome ters. I was already 
tired. It™s winter, snow. I™m not equipped with 
snow, any skis or anything. He brought me  to th
e door, I knocked at the 
door, I opened the door 
and here it is, I™m standing in the doorway and th
e person who was on the train stands inside of 
the kitchen. He says to me , you are alive? I l
ooked all over Germany, 
between the refugees, 

trying to find you. I said, you didn™t show up to ta
ke us away. He was supposed to come  with 

horses, take us away, across. 

Q: From wh ere to where? 

A: For -- from where we were hiding two years. 
Their estate was not too 
far. He was supposed to 
come  in and we waited for him to show up, he
 never showed up. What happened, he was cut 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
157 
 
away, couldn™t cross any [indecipherable]. The Ru
ssians were comi ng from that side, he couldn™t 
ge -- he couldn™t come  in. So he knew that we 
were left behind. So when he saw me  t here he 
said, where are you from?  I said, 
from Lithuania. He said, I don™
t believe it. Nobody come s out 
from Lithuania now. I says, well, we came, we managed. 

Q: And this was alrea
dy winter of ™46, of -- 
A: ™45. 

Q: Wi nter of ™45. 

A: ™45, yeah. 

Q: Okay, the war is still going on -- 

A: So could have been the six, January, 
February, because it -- I reme mber snow.  
Q: And the war is over? 

A: Oh yes, war was over in May.  

Q: All right, then it™s ™46.  
A: [indecipherable] 
Q: Wi nter of ™46. 

A: ™46. 

Q: Wi nter of ™46.  

A: Beginning of -- the end of wint
er ™45, beginning of winter ™46. 
Q: Correct.  

A: So I said, where is everybody?  Where is Ma
ma, where is grandmother, everybody?  He said, 
they are not too far from here. They are in -- 
in the refugee camp. And 
he came with me to see 
my mother, and then he took me  to meet his fam
ily, already here, in -- in
 the west. So now he 
explained to me the situation, he said now -- 
now you go to Lithuanian committee, get yourself a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
158 
 
DP card. I said, what™s a DP card?  All I have is 
from General Taylor, di -- 
ad -- written notes to 
accept the Lithuani an two wome n into the camp. He said, oh no, no, no. You go to your 
nationality committee and you get a 
displaced person™s card. In shor
t, DP card, that™s why the ec 
-- expression depokas. 

Q: Did you ever have passports leaving L
ithuania?  Did you ever any identity pa pers? 

A: I was too young. I was too young. 

Q: I see. 

A: I was too young. 

Q: Did your mother have a la -- let™s say, any identity pa pers? 

A: She had her Lithuanian passport. 

Q: Okay. 

A: But not ta -- saying that she is Jewish. 

Q: Okay. Just saying that she is Lithuanian. 
A: She was Lithuanian. And not Polish, either. 
Q: That™s right. So -- 

A: So now he explained to me  that I have to
 go to Lithuanian comm
ittee in Munich and get 
Mama  and myself DP c a rds. So I go to the Lith
ua nian committee, and Mr . Carvalis was the head 
of the committee. He listened to my story and 
he says, you know what 
Panana Nela?  I knew your 
father very well. I™d do anything 
to help you, but my hands are tied. Nobody at this date can get a 
displaced person™s card. You are past the peri
od. Finished. Everybody who came  from Lithuania 

as refugees, everybody™s set, everybody has a car
d, everybody is registered. No more cards. And 
I cannot tell now Americans that 
you just came  fr om Soviet Union via Jewish aliyah. You see, 
too ma ny -- too ma ny contradictions.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
159 
 
Q: Too ma ny aliases. 
A: Too ma ny aliases. So I said, so Mr. Carval
is, so what do you advise me ?  He said look, two 
blocks away is Jewish committee. Go to Jewish
 committee. Carvalis knew my father, said, go to 
Jewish committee, tell them who you are and 
have the Jewish committee help you because the 
Jewish people still kept escaping 
Soviet Union in those days and a 
lot of refugees came  in ™46 - 
™47 - ™48, running away from the S
oviets. So now I go to Jewish 
commi ttee and naturally in the 
Jewish committee everybody knows who 
I am. So I said, gentlemen -- 
Q: They didn™t in Berlin, but they did in Munich? 

A: Munich were Lithuanian Jews
. In Berlin were German Jews. So German Jews, me  telling that 
I™m Gens™ daughter didn™t get anything. Here when 
they saw me , their approach is, what can we 
do for you?  A different approach. So I told them
 that I was brought by aliyah, that the lithu -- I 
went to Lithuanian committee, they cannot help 
me . They sa ys, what™s the problem?  We™ll give 
you here. We™ll get you a DP card and that™s it. 
And what they did for us, you know, like in each 
place there are two classe s. They sent  Mother 
and me  to Saint Ottilian. Saint Ottilian was a 
German sanitory -- or -- or a -- 

Q: Sanitori um. 

A: -- san -- sanitorium for SS officers. So after th
e war, that sanitorium wa s taken away from the 

SS, they left some  SS doctors working and gave it for the inma tes of concentration camp, the 

Jewish inma tes of concentration camp. And since 
Vilnius is considered 
a concentration camp, we 
were given a status of concentration camp in
ma t e s and sent direct to Saint Ottilian. 
Q: Wo w. 

A: We  come  to Saint Ottilian and the first 
doctor who looked at my mothe r  was Dr. Berman 
from Kauna s. He said Mrs. Gens, how are you?  
You look like the Jesus Christ crucified. There™s 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
160 
 
nothing left. Mama  was awful looking. All that te
nsion, all those borders 
and everything, drained 
her completely. And Dr. Berman was her doctor when she had pneumoni a for the seventh time , 
he was treating her for pneumonia, he didn™t even
 expect her to survive. So Dr. Ber man did 
everything in his power to put her back on her 
feet. So we had the most -- most wonderful 
conditions, except that we  lived in a palatta, in
 a -- in a sickroom, I 
mean if -- a room for 
probably 20 people at least. But we had wonderf
ul food, and we could relax and the nervous 
tension was gone, you see?  And we stayed in Sain
t Ottilian for quite awhile. But that was only 

for privileged people. And then -- 

Q: So that your -- your friends from Vilnius -- 

A: They put us on the track -- 

Q: -- helped you -- helped you -- 

A: They put us with aliyah --  

Q: Aliyah. 
A: -- with -- the whole way -- you see, we lost
 connection. We  found Dr. Feigenberg, how to 
continue the connection -- 
Q: That™s right. 

A: -- and some how we ma naged. And we stayed 
with them very long, until Mama was back on 
her feet. And then we decided that I™ll go to 
Munich and enter university. So when I came to 
Munich and went to the universit
y, they wouldn™t accept people born 
in ™26. They were a -- they 
were having hordes of German soldiers comi ng 
from Russian prisoner™s camp, and priority was 
for the older ones, not for born in ™26. How much
 I tried, how much the Jewish committee tried. 
They said, we don™t ma ke any exceptions to that
 regulation. So I figured, well, if I can™t go to 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
161 
 
university, I™ll go to conservatory. So I went to
 Munich conservatory, 
continued, you know, tra-
la-l a. 
Q: Music.  

A: Yeah. Then they -- they star
ted to talk about registration to 
United States. We  registered to go 
to United States as refugees, but I was pa
st 21, and my quota was very bad. There were 
thousands of Lithuanians, but very small quota. 
Lithuania was a small country. So I had to wait 
years for my  quota and my mother refused to go without me . So we stayed, and one day a -- do 

you know Veruch™s reform -- 

Q: Yes. 

A: -- the monetary reform. 

Q: Monetary reform 1948. 

A: One day we woke up, 20 ma rks a person. We
ll, 20 ma rks a person, it™s a beginning. You 

know, again, everything. We  were already very 
well set. We  had the [indecipherable] cards. I 
was attending conservatory, and we weren™trich, but we -- we  ma naged to survive. 

Q: I have a question that [ind
ecipherable] you said at one point when you were in Germany you 
were looking to see where is Hingst, 
where is Murer, where is W- We iss? 
A: Mama  didn't want me, she was so f -- so agai
nst, but I wanted -- I wanted to find out what 
happened to these people. 

Q: We re you able to find out? 

A: No, no. I found out later that Murer was arrested by the Soviets, spent se
veral years in Soviet 
Union, but when he returned back to Austria, th
ey found him not guilty, but at least I think he  sat 
for six years in Soviet camps. We ll, that™s good enough. 

Q: At least that much. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
162 
 
A: Weiss -- Weiss died in German c -- prison. 
This is unforgettable th
ings, I shouldn™t have 
listened to my mother, I should have gotten some
how to We iss to find out about my father. She 
wouldn™t let me. She didn™t want 
anything to do with the Germans.
 And that was the only liaison 
that could have helped me  to find out about him.
 He ma y not have wanted to talk to me , but 
maybe there are some memoirs or something, you 
know. But We iss was dead. I went to see Mr. 
Wi esenthal when I was in Vienna and I asked Mr
. Wi esenthal ma ybe he can help me  to find out 
about what happened to my fath
er. He said he has absolutely no idea. There are no -- 
Q: No traces. 
A: -- no traces, no. 

Q: No documents. 

A: No documents, no. 

Q: Do you know if there is any documentation in 
German archives that would have been passed 
on by the Gestapo or -- 
A: It could. It could, it could. 
Q: I see. 

A: It could. 

Q: But he didn™t have
 it at his fing --  
A: No. 

Q: -- he didn't  have it. 

A: He didn™t have an -- it. No. I think the Gesta
po -- I think Gestapo kept paper work in order, so 
you see, the -- those -- when I worked for office 
of special investigatio
ns, they got lists of 
collaborators of the me mbers of the sonde
rcommando in the German documentation -- 
Q: Archives. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
163 
 
A: -- archives. So there could be that some thing is
 in there, but how to find it, I don™t know. See 
Mama  is -- Mama  is gone. If Mama  would be alive, ma ybe I could try to do some thing. Now that 
she is gone, I mean that™s -- it would have given 
her a peace of mi nd at least, to know. Now this 
way we don™t know anything. So anyway, that™s it, so -- 

Q: Nurembe r g. Your daughter me ntioned Nuremb erg. 

A: That I was in Nuremb erg, yeah. 

Q: So how did this happen?   

A: When I was -- now -- now I™m back to the Jewish side. 

Q: Yes. 

A: There was a close [indecipherable] where we 
were staying was a huge Jewish camp, town of 
Landsberg. And there was a big concert in Land
sberg. Dr. Fe igenberg was one of the chief 
people in Landsberg, so he told me  look, take a tr
ain, come  to Landsberg. I come  to -- it™s like a 
ghetto concert. All Jewish [indecipherable] everything, and Dr. Feigenberg came  to the door, 
took me  by the hand and ma rched me  to the first row, like I wa s used to. And I recognized on my  
way, our companions from the Berlin Jewish house. And they™re looking at me  and they know 

that Mama wasn™t Jewish, they could -- they co
uld see it, her blue ey
es and everything. And 
they™re looking at me  what I™m doing sitting in th
e first row. The Jewish 
people had their -- well, 
how would you say?  I reme mber one expression
, Papa tried to ma tch -- if some body had a 
yellow schein and had no wife, he would ma tch them
, not to sleep in one 
bed, but give a wife a 
chance. He had one of his people who used to be
 chargé d™affair of 
Hungary in Kaunas, Mr. 
Browdig, of a very rich family, and he was give
n the work as a -- like a mi nister of foreign 
country. And one day we were standing, Mama , Pa
pa and I, Mr. Brownig -- Browdig come s ove r 
and he says, a -- well, in -- in -- I™ll tell you 
in Russian, see if you understand. [speaks Russian 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
164 
 
here] The attached wife of Mr. Glassman sits in 
the first row, and my wife  sits in second row. 
You see the hierarchy?  It was 
-- in the ghetto it wa s very impor
tant who you are. And during the 
concert, who you are sat in first row and second 
row. And then came the [indecipherable]. I™ll 
never forget that. My mother smiled and said, Pa
pa, I™m going to second row. I™ll ma ke place for 

Browdig in first row. [indecipherable] 

Q: And she did. 

A: She did, yeah. But you see, to be insulted by 
the fact, could -- my God, you know, first row or 
second row. Well, but that existed. So anyway -- 

Q: You were in the first row and it wa s a concert. 

A: It was a concert exactly like in ghetto, all Je
wish faces. Exactly. But then we decide d that™s 
enough sitting at Saint Ottilian and we moved to 
Munich, where I entered conservatory and we 
registered with the Amer ican consulate. During 
those days of registra
tion and all kinds of, you 
know, checking of the papers, th-t
his and that, I opened the door
. It was the big caserna, the -- 
Q: Canteen? 

A: -- can -- no, no, army  barracks where the im
mi gration process was going on. I opened the 
door and I see Mr. Josef Mushkat. I™ll show 
you mush -- Mr. Mushkat on the big picture. 
Mushkat was a me mber of Papa™s higher police, 
and he was in charge of orphans, orphanage, 
taking care of them, schooling, feeding, everythi
ng that was necessary to do for orphans. He saw 
me , he ca me  over. The first question is, where is Mama ?  I said, Mama  is outside. Cause I came  

to get some  information, Mama  does n™t know an
ything, so she™s outside. So he grabbed me  by 
the hand, we went outside, they both cried. 
And then Mr. Mushkat says, look, nobody knows me  
here as Josef Mushkat. I am under a different name
 and I don™t want them to know that I™m Josef 
Mushkat. I said, look, as far as 
we are concerned, you can be whoe
ver you are. So, I haven™t seen 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
165 
 
Mr. Mushkat from that day, any mor e , cause I 
had no business going for infor mation, I got what 
I needed. I cannot explain why -- I 
can™t explain -- I think he got
 tired to be a Jew. He was 
Polish, high class, intelligent person. Wr iter. He 
gave us a book in Polish language that he just 
recently wrot e, and I think he had enough bei
ng a Jew and wanted to 
be a regular Gentile. 
Q: He wanted to just change his identity. 
A: Yeah, he wanted to change his identity. 

Q: An -- but you never saw him again? 

A: I never saw him again, no. If he -- if he was af
raid to be exposed, why should I put a person -- 
I went through so much myself not to be e
xposed, why should I ma ke some one uncomfortable 
by thinking that I mi ght un-unknowingly tell some
body, you know. So now I can talk about Mr. 
Mushkat because he would be my fa ther™s age,
 so he™s definitelynot alive. But I never 

me ntioned to anyone from -- 

Q: That you had seen him. 
A: -- Vilnius that I™ve seen him here. So -- aha, so
 after the financial reform, I got a letter from a 
classmate who lived in Munich very close to wh
ere I and Mama  lived, her parents and she. She 
wrote me  a letter that, listen Ada, I™m working 
at the UNRRA in French zone of occupation. We  
badly need a secretary for the o
ffice of communi cations to work w
ith the director and there is a 
very big tension between Latvians and Lithuani
ans. Everybody would like to have that job. The 
problem is you need French to talk with -- 
the whole UNRRA personnel is French. You need 
English to get through the direc
tions from Switzerland, that they
 come  in English. You need 
German to talk to the German authorities,
 and you need Polish, Russian, whatever, and 
Lithuanian to take care of the refugees. TheLatvians have perfect pe
ople, no French. Perfect 
English, perfect German, no French. So Lit
huanians are asking us do we know anybody that 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
166 
 
could fill. And we all feel that the only person to
 fill that place is you. So, I read that letter and 
said, Mama , French zone is so far away. We  are 
set in here, we™re waiting for departure. What 
the hell will I be doing in the Fren
ch zone of occupation?  I™d never -- 

Q: And the -- the French zone of 
occupation was in the north, or -- 
A: Sa -- it -- it -- no, Salzburg. [indecipherable] 

Q: Salzburg. 

A: [indecipherable] 

Q: Okay. So yes, of course, it™s quite far away. 

A: Quite far away. And said, I never worked in 
my life. I don™t know offic e  work. We  used to 
have class magazines, you know, class newspaper, 
so I would do it with one finger. But we still 
had a typewr iter at home , and the others didn™t. 
So I said Mama , how can I work?  Couple of days 
after, I get another letter. Two 
days after, I get a cable. So Mama  said to me , look, said, she 
started with 20 ma rks like you -- we 
did. She already paid for the cab
le, she paid for two letters. 
So get a ticket, go over there, explain to them 
that you™re not able to take the job, you never 
worked in your life. And you™llsee the world and you come  back. 
I -- I come over and they -- 
they tell me  the picture. The secretary of comm
unications was expecting a baby in two months. 
The father of the baby to be was a director of
 YMCA, Polish nobleman. So now the situation is 
awful. The lady can™t bend down any more, the rumo
rs that the father is
 a director of YMCA, 
they want to get rid of her as soon as possibl
e. It shows it very badl
y during, you know, the -- th-
the entire, you know, community. So I told [indeci
pherable] I spoke to him in French, I said, 
mon colonel, I -- I would li -- take the job gladly, 
but I have never worked in my life. So he said, 
Mademoiselle, please just stay. Whatever 
you can do, do. Whatever you 
cannot, not. At least 
stay until we find some body to fill that
 place. So that it -- that™s 
-- that what happened. I started 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
167 
 
to work, I started to work and then I figured th
ere™s nothing to it. I handled the correspondence. I 
handed the director his correspondence, I can handle
 correspondence to the 
others. I see what has 
to be done and I accept, you know, instructions fr om
 Geneva in -- in English, I sort them out. 
What™s there a -- what™s there to
 be afraid?  And you know
, I started to work, I started to work 
and very soon I received an army uniform, and I 
-- I am a lieutenant of the French army, official. 
So, my girl -- my lady -- my girlfriend who got me, she was always a civilian, so she can say 

look, you just came. I™m already here seve
ral mo nths and I™m a civilian and you™re 
[indecipherable] army officer. So anyway, I stayed
 there and one day the di
rector called two of 
us. He said, look, the Australian military mi ssi
on is comi ng to round up refugees for Australia. 

Talk to your fa milies and see if any one of you is 
interest ed to go to Australia. I™ll attach you as 
UNRRA officer to the Australians to travel  
around that area, the whole French zone of 

occupation. And then that™ll help
 you -- open you the doors in Aust
ralia. So I talked to my 
mother, I went to Munich back, and M-Mama  
said, you know what?  Your quota is so far away 
and we™re sitting so close to Russian zone of o
ccupation, why don™t we go to Australia and that™s 
it. And then, later on if we decide that we wa
nt to go to America, the quota will follow you. And 
the Estonian girl, she came  back, she said no, my fa
mily is not interested to go to Australia, we™ll 
stay in here until our American priority date comes in. So they attached me to the Australians 

and I traveled with them for a long time, getting refugees processed for Australia. 

Q: How interesting. 

A: Very interesting. So, not to take too much time 
for that, I -- when we had out of first ship, it 
was a 1,800 people on it and you had cream of 
the crop of UNRRA personnel. Both s -- 
Hungarians, Roma nians, Latvians, Estonians, 
Lithuanians sent whatever wa s left over, 
Ukrainians, Polish, Russians. A
nd we arrived Australia -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
168 
 
Q: I don™t want to get ou
t of the European -- 
A: Mm-h m.  
Q: -- continent yet. 

A: Yeah, yeah, not yet? Okay. 

Q: Not yet, because we haven™t talked about Nuremberg. 

A: Oh, yes, so Nurembe r g, what happened at that concert.  

Q: [indecipherable] two mi nutes, okay. 

A: We can start. 

Q: We ll, in -- in that 
case -- in that case
, let™s finish up when you get 
to Australia and then we™ll 
go back to Nuremberg. 

A: Okay. 

Q: Okay. 

A: On the ship I continued in the office pr
ocessing the paperwork. There™s tremendous 
paperwork because you are crossing Suez Canal. You 
have to ma ke lists and lists and lists to 
report to the British. So when we came to Melbour
ne, and then we were sent to a reception 
center -- the same  day we arrived reception center
, I was put to work for 
immigration department 
already in Australia. And our sh
 -- pol -- the policy to get thos
e refugees was dome stics and 
laborers, dome stics and laborers. So everybody ho
t -- got an I.D., me n as laborers, wome n as 
dome stic servants. I was the only one, because of 
my Australian cooperation, with Australians  in 
Europe, I was given office worker. So I was 
not a dome stic. Two years contract, you do 
whatever the governme nt says you to do. You go 
wherever the government sends you to work. 
No, yes, buts or anything, you just go. Two 
years over, you™re a free person, do whatever you 
want. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527

Q: When you arrived in Au
stralia, how old were you? 
A: In ™48, 22. 
Q: 22. 

A: 22.  

Q: Boy. 

A: Mm-h m.  

Q: Quite a life until age 22. 

A: Oh yeah. Oh yeah, I know. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: Don™t wish anyone -- I don™t wish 
anyone -- so we™ll still have to -- 
End of Tape 11

Beginning Ta pe 12 
Q: Okay. 
A: I me ntioned -- I me ntioned that I went
 to that -- the concert in Landsberg. 
Q: That™s right. 

A: In Landsberg they already formed a symphony
 orchestra and the me mb ers were all survivors 
of Dachau. And there were, from Lithuania,
 the previous me mbers of our Kaunas symphony. 
They all knew about me  and they took me  in, ju
st took me  in like a ma scot. I was the youngest 
one, and you know, I ha -- I didn't have anybody but my
 mother and I felt very secure with them. 
So one day they told us that, you know what?  We
 have a possibility to go to attend Nuremberg 
trials, we want to take you with us. I sai
d, fine, why not?  Now, I don™t reme mber a concert 
before the trials. I believe they 
gave a concert. I reme mber the th
eater, reme mber sitting in the 
loge and reme mber being left by myself, so they
 must have been on the 
stage giving a concert. 
And they gave a concert in the [indecipherabl
e] uniforms, it™s a striped blue and white. 
Q: As -- as concentration camp inmat es. 

A: [indecipherable] inma tes, right. So a day af
ter that, we had a two 
day pass to the trials. 
Q: Did you know who was on tria
l? Wa s it widely publicized? 
A: That was a big Nuremberg trial, with all of
 them, Goebbels, Goering, everybody, ger -- they 
all sat in a row. 

Q: Okay, that one. Okay. 

A: And that particular day, they  were trying finance mi nister Sp
eer. As you know, in a -- in a hall 
with all military it™s all dr ab. 
Uniforms, uniforms, uniforms. I had on a dress that  was burnt 
orange. Not yark -- not the sharp 
orange, but burnt orange, but sti
ll it st ood out in that  immense 
place. And I was telling my children when I came b
ack from t hat place that the heads of those 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
171 
 
German inmates automatically turned to see that s-
speck of light, of differe
nt color than the drab 
uniforms. Anyway, Mr. Speer was start -- was a --
 a -- questioned, and he was told that, did you 
know -- he was asked, did you know about the con
centration camps?  And he said no, I never 
knew about that. And then they opened the big sc
reen, and on the screen you could see golden 
fra mes of eyeglasses, golden teeth, golden je
welry. And they said, how do you think, Mr. Speer, 
your treasury got all this stuff without you know
ing where it comes from?  
Speer kept s -- not -- 
no answer. So that registered in my mi nd, it wa
s so impressive. Suddenly you opened the screen, 
you show the picture and he has no way to say a
ny more, I didn™t know. So that was how I ge -- 
came to be in Nurember g, because that -- the s 
-- the survivor™s group took me with them for 
their concert and then we -- two days in
 a row we attended Nuremberg trials.  
Q: Now, a lot of people have said that Nuremberg 
trials was victor™s justice, particul ar ly because 
the Soviet Union was involve
d. Did you feel that way? 
A: No. I think justice was done. Soviet Union or 
France or -- or whoever, 
justice was done. I feel 
no remorse about them being punished. Let it be 
Soviet Union™s influence, so what? So what? 
Q: No, no, no, the question was not that the sov -- b
ecause the Soviet Union was there, that that™s 
a bad thing, because these were really criminal
s and they should have been. But because the 
Soviet Union itsel f was guilty of so many crimes against humanity -- 
A: Yeah, oh, okay. 

Q: -- then, it -- di -- it 
made it a politicized event. 
A: Okay, but that came out later.
 In those days, how much did we
 know in -- in the west about 
the Soviet Union?  It started with Solzhenitsyn, with his books, with opening our horizon to see 

what™s going on in Soviet Union. Just Lithuanian
s telling that we had th
ree days of deportation 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
172 
 
was not enough crime. The whole crime, the whole gulags and everything came after that. So in 
those days we didn™t know about th
e gulags as much as we know today. 
Q: I see. 

A: So I would say that, nevermind what the worl
d is telling today, naturally the Soviet Union 
found another way to kill the people. More hum
a ne?  I don™t know. Freezing and Siberian tigers? 
Is that so more humane than sitting in a concentration camp a nd being gassed?  Wa  -- how would 

you compar e one with the other? There is 
no comparison, both are 
equally bad. But -- 
Q: In other words, that -- that
 sort of thought didn™t cross -- 
given that your parents had the 
political views that they had, gi
ven that your father had -- had 
spoken out against the Russo-Finu 
-- the Fi nnish war that the Soviet Union started, gi
ven the whole political proc
livity that this --  
your fa mily was not a pro-Soviet family in 
that you were not happy w
ith the Soviet Union 
comi ng in, those thoughts weren™t crossing your
 mi nd when you were sitting in the --  
A: No. 
Q: -- in Nuremberg. 
A: No. 

Q: You saw that at least -- 

A: I saw the criminal element who ruined my life,
 who ruined my mother™s life, who killed my 
father, who killed millions of people and that 
was what I thought. Nothing about the Russian 
gulags or anything at that time. Later on we starte
d to compare one with the other, and as I say, 
what™s better, to be gassed or to be fr ozen 
to death, you don™t know what™s -- what™s better. But 
the -- in those days, no. I figured that ju
stice was done and they deserved it.  
Q: And their -- again, this was only, I believe, 21 or 22 -- 

A: Right, right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
173 
 
Q: -- of an en --an 
entire machinery. 
A: Right, right. Papa used to talk about Mr. Mu
rer. He was of impression that Murer was a drug 
addict. He said that there were days when you 
could talk to him like to -- talking to norma l 
person, and there were days when he went berser
k, you couldn™t talk to him. And he thought that 
the withdrawal symptoms when he didn™t have
 drugs, were ma in reason when he was so 
inhuman. That was my father™s opini on because he
 said it™s impossible to ha ve the same person 
behave this way and that way. 
Q: The -- er ratic. 

A: Erratic, right. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: He would come  into the room and he w
ould start, up, down, on your knees, up, down. Don™t -

- do -- he made workers jump up and down for 
no reason. So Papa got suspicious that -- 
suspicious that he must be under influence of 
drugs, because he could compare Murer with the 
others. Nobody behaved like Murer, nobody. He was a 
single person with such bestiality. And he 
said, well one day he™ll pay for it. But you see, 
six years is not much. 
Six years is not much. 
Well, Soviet gulag for six years is quite a bit,
 but it™s not much. And th
en to be exonerated by 
Austrian authorities?  And it™s strange because Aust
rians were always believed to be  more away 
from Hitler, not such supporters 
of Hitler. He turned out to be 
very, very supportive of Hitler. So 
now that™s how I got to 
Nuremberg [indecipherable] 

Q: So those were the two days that you -- 

A: The two days. We  spent -- I think we spent mo
re than two days, but I mean, one day for the 
concert, then two days we spent in the trials.

Q: But it wasn™t -- and you also sa -- me ntione
d at another point that you were on your way to 
Australia at some  point afterw
ards, but that wasn™t your firs
t destination. Didn™t you say -- 
A: No, Ame r ica. 
Q: -- the aliyah. The aliyah to Israel. 

A: Oh, I -- oh, you -- yeah, to Is
rael, you see, what happened, it was Palestine. Some  people 
ma nage -- probably you had to have big money -- 
ma naged to get it -- exact wording is l -- 
landing permit. A permit to enter, legally, Palestine.
 I was talking in the Je wish committee, I sa id 
look, for all that Papa did, try to get Mother la
nding permit. I don™t care about myself, I can go 
with aliyah. I don™t -- I™m 
not afraid of difficulties or what
ever, but not my mother. She went 
through too much, physically. She 
can™t go with aliyah. And they
 tried. They tried, but they 
explained to me , you need the big money to be ab
le to procure a landing permit, or you have to 
be very, very fa mous figure. But not ma ny peopl e have received a permit. And I was to be on 

this boat. I believe that was the Exodus boat.
 If you reme mbe r  the story of Exodus, I was 
supposed to be on that boat, but when they c
ouldn™t get Mama landing permit, I said, I™m not 
going alone and I™m not leaving my mother in Ge rm
any. So, since there is no way to get her, I™m 
just resigning and I™m not going to go by myse
lf. That was the only reason why I didn't go, 
because a lot of my friends were already in Israel and we had family in Israel from before. So I 

didn't mi nd going, and Mama  didn
't  mi nd going, but not in he r physical condition. She was -- 
Q: Did she speak much a bout your fath -- you sa id that at some  point she just stopped. 

A: Stopped. 

Q: Did she talk much about her lif
e with your father, after the war? 
A: No. Not much, no. I -- I don™t believe -- I don™t
 believe she was able to. I reme mb er when we 
were in hiding, some  da ys we did things around th
e house and Mama  liked to take birds, geese, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
175 
 
ducks, into the fields. She said th
at gives her peace of mi nd, not to 
talk to people, she can talk to 
the birds. And that would quieten her down. Cause 
I told you, she would sit 
in one corner, looked 
-- look -- look at another corner. She took it mu ch 
harder than anyone I have seen. Much harder. 
And well, she was preoccupied with my childre
n because I had a big 
number of children. She 
helped me to raise the children. 
Q: But it mu st have been very difficult for you to
 see that and know that 
there was very little you 
could do to relieve it. 

A: I couldn™t. And that™s what 
it was, you know, I tried -- I tried my best. Look, I pulled her -- it 
was through [indecipherable] of let™s try, let™s 
go, let™s do, let™s do, but 
she -- I think the reason 
that we left, she was afraid. Not for herself, 
she wa s afraid for me . Th
at™s the only reason why 
she agreed to try and risk crossing the -- we 
crossed probably five bor
ders. First one wa s to 
Poland. Next one was to Berlin. Next one was to 
American side of Berlin. Next time to Hanover, 
and then to Munich. Five borders. And it™s not 
so simple. Today when we speak, it seems like 
nothing. It wasn™t so simple. I forgot to tell you, 
when I me ntioned to you 
that we were leaving 
Lódz with aliyah, my aunt remained -- my mothe
r™s sister rema ined in Kaunas. She gave up, she 
said she was too scared and she stayed. And the
n, couple of days after we left, she figured out 
that she can™t stay by he rself, she wants to join 
us. So she went to the Polish commission and she 

told them the story and she said now, can you 
help me ?  So they said fine, we™ll do now 
some thing different. We  had -- 

Q: Did she speak Polish? 

A: Yes. They said, we™ll give you a copy of th
e original repatriation document, but it has two 
ladies and the youngster. You take a lady with 
her daughter, instead of
 your sister and your 
niece. And that was one of our known young ballerin
as and he r mother. So they traveled on the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
176 
 
repatriation document budreika 
a-and she brought them to Poland. Now, on the way, since we 
knew each ot her and she -- she was helping the Je
wish people very much, when she came  to 
Berlin, the same  story with aliyah, she doesn™t 
look Jewish. So the -- our Jewish people got her 
on aliyah same  way, and aliyah
 brought her to Germany. 
Q: Can you speak a little bit about her?  We  haven™t 
talked much about her role in the war, and so 
we™re going back. But you said she 
worked closely with Ona −ima it
¡
. 
A: Yes. 
Q: How was  she involved in the rescue of 
Jews, or how was she involved in Ona −imait
¡
™s 
work?  How did -- how --  

A: Tatta -- 

Q: -- how -- what role she play? 

A: -- Ta-Tatta knew −imait
¡
 through us. 
Q: Okay. 
A: She was in Kaunas, −ima it
¡
 was in Vilnius. I knew from di scussions with Tatta, several 
name s in Ka unas of people who helped Jewish people. I don™t believe there was a connection of 
Kaunas people with Vilnius people, th
ere was no connection. And −i ma it
¡
 was connected to 
Tatta through us. And Tatta did whatever sh
 -- was in her abilit
ies to help −imait
¡
. Sh -- Tatta 
worked mor e  in Kaunas, where there was a group, 
and all these people were Russian nationals in 
Lithuania. They were Lithuanian Russians. Th
ere was Dr. Kutraga. Th
ere was -- you know, it™s 
difficult -- the lady, she had a beauty -- beauty sa
lon. Her -- her -- her son was in our basketball -
- what was it, playing [indecipherable] I™ll -- I™
ll reme mber the name . Anyway, I knew the first 
names of some of the m, and these people really 
di d at most that was possible to do. Pulling out, 
getting places to live, getting places to 
hide. It was a very well organized group. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
177 
 
Q: And were any of them caught, as 
far as your knowledge was concerned? 
A: No. 
Q: No.  

A: −imait
¡
 was the only one that was caught. 
Q: And do you know the circumstances of her capture? 

A: No, because we weren™t there. Tatta -- Tatta 
rema ined in Kaunas when we went into hiding 
and then one day she told us that Onos neera,
 Ona isn™t any more here. So we understood. So 
after I found out that she was ve
ry brutally beaten up, she was thrown into concentration camp, 
but we didn™t know whether she s-survived or 
not. She never looked 
back. She never looked 
back. And later, from the press, I found out that
 she was in France and that she went to visit 
Israel, but they think climate di
dn™t work for her. She returned back to France and she died in 
France. And then when I found her brother™s article
 about her, I realized
 that she was who she 
was, a being that you couldn™t put on higher pedest
al that she was, but she was also a communist. 
Well, which -- nothing to do with it.  

Q: Yeah. 

A: Yeah. But Tatta was cooperating with −ima it
¡
. I -- I wouldn™t give you any details because I 
really don™t know how they did it, what they di
d, but I know that she 
helped her carrying the 
waste, getting food, you know, thi
ngs like that. Course Tatta was mostly spending her time in 
Kaunas and then she would come  to Vilnius, 
stay with us and what
 -- help with −imait
¡
. 
Q: Your uncle when he returned from Dachau, 
you said earlier that he didn™t speak much about 
what had happened in Siauliai in the tim
e that he was the ghetto police chief -- 
A: Right. 

Q: -- but that he did talk
 about Dachau. Which -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
178 
 
A: He talked about Dachau, ta
lked about his experience overthere. He talked about the 
conversations they used to have, the inma te
s, what would the conversations be about. 
Q: And wha t  were they about? 
A: And he said that mos t  conversations were fa
ntasies, what we would like to eat. What we 
would like to be served. And he 
said that at one point it was 
really tough. Some body said that he 
would like to have some  herring, and the pain, no
t being able, was so obvious that people were 
telling him, shut up. Don™t me ntion it any more, we
 don™t want to hear it. 
See, y-you™re deprived 
for so long that even me ntioning it 
makes it bitter -- bitter memories. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: But he never complained. And in his first lette
r that I received it, that
 was very interesting 
how I found him. He wrote in his first letter that
 morally I am not broken 
at all, but physically, I 
am finished. HIAS looked for him,
 Joint looked for him. All those, you know, the bort -- the -- 
the -- the notices, everybody. Nowhe r e. Disappeared
 completely. So one day I got a letter from 
HIAS. We  found -- 

Q: And HIAS is? 

A: Hebrew aid -- aid -- like -- like Joint, same  thing. 

Q: All right. 

A: They™re two different organizations both -- bo
th being the same  thing. We found trace of your 
uncle. Get in touch with such a
nd such person in Israel and you™ll get mo re information. So what 
-- 

Q: And this is about what year? 

A: Oh, that was quite a bit afte
r. Must be ™56. Must be ™56 because I remember we were able 
already to send parcel. When the Polish repatriati
on started in Soviet Union, they let the inma tes 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
179 
 
from gulags join the fami lies outside, repatriate
 to Poland. One of those families on the way, the 
father joined from the gulag and the father was 
telling stories with whom he was in gulag and 
how it was in gulag. They came to Poland and from 
Poland with aliyah they reached Israel. After 
they reached Israel, very shortly 
after, the father died from hear
t, he was overworked in gulag. 
Now, those people probably went to HIAS to join
 to look for their relatives, whatever. His son 
saw my uncle™s name  on the board, looking fo
r, do you know about him. And happily, he 
reme mbered that his father was me ntioning my un
cle™s name  during his stor
ies from gulag. So he 
reported to HIAS that all I can tell
 you is that my father was in such and such camp together with 
him. And that must have been already the time
 when they st arted to let them go fr om gulag. 
Liquida -- 

Q: So you didn™t even know he had been in the gulag until that point. 

A: No, no, he disappeared from the ground of the ear
th. And they sent -- I me ntioned to you that 
my aunt had to hide that her 
husband is in Vorkuta. She didn™t know exactly where, but she had 
to hide, and she told that he found another woma n, 
he left her and he is some wheres with that 
woma n in Soviet Union. And then when finally he
 was released, they found 
each other. There is 
some thing that I don™t recall. I know that some body some how was found through my uncle in 

Montevideo. Whether he wrote to Montevideo, wh
ether Mother™s brother wrote to Montevideo, 

but some how me mbers of the fa mily got togeth
er through Ur uguay, but I don™t recall now which 
one. So anyway, when he returned, she told that 
he doesn™t wa nt that other woma n any more, he 
returned to the family. Now the aunt, what 
happened when they arrested him in Klaip
¡
da, she 
grabbed her daughter, same  way like Mama  and I, a
nd disappeared. She knew that it™s -- next is 
her turn, they -- she disappeared. And as much a s
 we all looked for her, Mama ™s brother went 
through every nook and nook, wherever you could think 
to look for her and he wrote exactly, she 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
180 
 
disappeared from this earth. [indecipherable] th
ere™s nothing else I can 
do, I can™t find her. So 
later on we learned that she had acquaintances in
 Moscow, she went to them. They se nt her to 
Moldavia and she was living in Moldavia. She wa
s a very intelligent person. She got a job as a 
postmistress. [speaks foreign language here]. That 
was her address. Until he returned, and he told 
us that when he saw how she lived, it broke his h
eart. In all those letters, I have so many letters 
from hi m, he described the mi sery, the condition
s in that [indecipherable] unbelievable. And he 
didn™t ha ve anything. So when we found each ot
her -- I believe he must have written to 
Montevideo. 
Q: To be able to trace her back. 

A: To trace -- no, to trace us.  

Q: Oh, I see. 

A: To trace us. That was the way how we found each
 other later. I mean, I got the -- fr om HIAS 
that he is alive, but I couldn™
t trace him in Moldavia. I believe
 he wrote to Montevideo, to 
Mama ™s brother, cause we knew all thes
e addr esses by heart. And that™s -- 
Q: Did you ever see your uncle again? 

A: No. He died. I see s -- I -- I went to s-see 
his wife, his her -- Elana, 
her daughter, but not him. 
So after I mentioned to you -- I show you the pictur
es, you saw his face. So physically he said he 
was gone. Vorkuta pulls the last strength 
of your body, and that™s the underground work. 
Q: Oh yeah. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: What year did he die? 

A: He died -- he died -- he died
 -- she got ma rried -- wa -- I have 
to look at the date when she got 
ma rried, he died very soon after her wedding. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
181 
 
Q: So he never left the Soviet Union? 
A: He never left the Soviet Union, no. But Soni
a and aha -- so Elana™s -- how did Elana get out? 
Her husband was Polish citizen. He 
was Ukrainian, from that. So the way to -- or sh -- or they 
left when it was let my people go. That could have
 been. I think that was 
how the -- that let my 
people go time, and they left for Israel. 

Q: I see. 

A: And whe n I went to Israel, I found more of 
my father™s relatives. Di
stant cousins, closer 
cousins, they couldn™t believe that I am aliv
e. In Lithuania everybody thought that we are 
finished there, we don™t exist any mo re. It
 was such a surprise to see me  alive. 
Q: Thank you. 

A: You™re welcome. 

Q: Miss Ada. 

A: You™re welcome. 
Q: For sharing so much with us today. 
A: I think it™s the first time that I -- I really sa
t and thought about it, tried 
not to forget. There is 
so much that it™s easy to forget. 

Q: Well -- 

A: And then don™t forget -- don™t forget how 
ma ny years it™s ago. It™s 1950™s or 60 --  
Q: Yes. 

A: -- 60 something years, right. Yeah. 

Q: We ll, without you we wouldn™t have -- 

A: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0527  
182 
 
Q: -- this view, this insi ght, this glimpse into
 a part of what was a 
catastrophe and how people 
lived through that catastrophe. 
A: Yeah, people -- people can take quite a dose
. People can. If you have an optimistic outlook 
and if you are not looking, you know, 
half full, half empty. If you look 
at half full, that helps. 
Q: Thank you. 

A: That helps, yeah. 

Q: Thank you. 

A: You™re welcome. 

Q: Thank you very much. 

A: You™re welcome.
