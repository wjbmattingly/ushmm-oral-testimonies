Question: This is the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Interview with Paul 
Felix Halpern conducted by Juliet Eninina (ph) on October 17 of 2010 at the 

Kindertransport Associ ation Conference in Arlington, Virginia.  Well , first of all, I would 

like to ask your first and last name, when you were born, and where.   

Answer: My name is Paul Halpern.  I was born in Vienna, Austri a November 29, 1932.  
Q: Well, first of all, thank you for giving us this interview.   
A: My pleasure.  

Q: I would like to thank you.  Let 's recall your childhood and your childhood years in 

Vienna before the war.  Where did you live at that ti me and what was your family like?   

A: I was the second chi ld and the first son of a manufacturer of rain coats.  Quite wealthy.  

We lived at 2 Elizabeth Straße, which is one bl ock off the wing in the first district.  And 

m y mother's 
-- m y mot her's father was a -- was a large manufacturer who had cl othing 
factories all over Europe, and the name of his factory was Airkakli dafabrake (ph), and m y 
father was -- worked for hi m.  He was an office I mean, he worked hi s wa y up t o be a 
manager, and m y grandfather finall y said, Have I got a girl for you.  
Andhe married m y 
mother who was a deb.  She was high in Jewish society.  And m y dad was 14 years old 

than she was, and t he y went away on the honeymoon.  When they came back, m y dad, he 

opened his own factory with the help of his father-in-law.  We -- we had a very, very nice 

life.  It was a lot of money.  We would summ er in Switzerland, and we would 
--
 
we had a

nanny and we would walk out of the house and go to -- go one bl ock and feed the horses 
in front of the opera house, and it was good -- really very, very nice and then --  

Q: How many sibl ings did you have?  

A: I had one sister.  
Q: Oh.  So just t wo of you?  
A: She was four years old -- three and a half years older than I was.  

Q: Two chi ldren in the family?  

A: Two -- t wo chil dren in the family.  My mother had two brothers, neither one had 

children --  

Q: Uh-huh.   

A: -- at that time, and m y father was born in Li mbeck (ph), Poland, and he came 
to -- came to Austria and he went to business school, and then he got  this job -- 
I mean, 
he -- he served in a -- he was -- he was a pri soner of the Russians during World War I, 
and then he came out, decided to work for m y grandfather, and event ually hard work 

pays off.  And he marri ed my mot her and i t was -- it was a good l ife.   

Q: And your mom was a housekeeper?  

A: No.  My mom was a debutante.  My mother had season tickets at t he opera.  My 

mother was a dilettante.  She -- she -- she went  to the Cordon Bleu cooking school, 
couldn't cook a lick.  We -- she -- she enjoyed her life.  She was a young -- she was a 
young woman who enjoyed her life, and made it all the more difficult later on in her life, 

but -- and I didn't -- I was a spoiled kid and so was m y si ster.  And we lived in an 

apartment, if I remember correctly, it was 11 rooms.  And our dini
ng roomwas big 

Interview with Paul Halpern 
 
5 
enough that  we used to do -- m y sister and I would race our tric ycles and bicycles in the 
dining room.  There was enough room to make turns.  It was that big.  So you -- 
you 
know, those -- the big trouble when you're five and six years old, you don't 

remember -- you remember pieces.  And riding m y bicycle is more important t han where 
I went to school, what I had to eat, you know, and those are things I remember.  
Q: Sure.  Can you describe your family as bei ng religious?  

A: No.  Absolutely not.  What's interesting -- m y father was the son of Ichivibulha (ph).  

You know, he lived in Poland and he was like tevea (ph) without the mil k route.  He 

was -- he was the vi llage hebruscal a (ph) basically, but, you know, you can't live on the 

chicken so mebody brings you for advice.  So his wife kept what would be now called the 

7-Eleven, you know.  She had the l ocal store, and people would come there, and he 
would sit there and give out advice.  I never knew either one because I'm named after m y 
grandfather and -- but they were smart enough that he was the oldest of six kids, and she 

said, Go to Austria.  Get a business degree.  Make enough mone y.  Bring your brother 

out.  When you bri ng your brother out, he goes to business school, gets a business degree.  

Bring your other brother out and t hen your sister, and the y all got out .  The y all went out  

and the y kept ties with the -- m y grandfather and my -- m y grandmot her died of natural 

causes.  I mean, that  was way before -- before the Nazis, but nobody was religion.  But 
m y dad could only pray orthodox.  I mean, we would -- when -- this was when I was 
conservative leaning toward reformed, but i n 
--
 we would go to t he synagogue.  The y had 
all three congregations, the Jewish and the Jaxonites (ph), and he would go downstairs to 

the little hole in the wall orthodox, and he would daven only in t he -- and passover with 

Interview with Paul Halpern 
 
6 
hi m was a disaster because he would go through the entire Haggadah i n Hebrew 
only -- never pausing for one word, and m y m other woul d be say, Joe, the dinner's getting 

cold, but we weren't religion.  No.  

Q: And what was t he name of your sister and your mother?  
A: My sister's name was Lucie, L-u-c-i-e, and my mother's name was Ditta, D-i-t-t-a, 
which is diminuti ve for Edith.  Lit tle Edit h.  But her name on her birt h certificate was 
Ditta, and m y grandfather and his -- the y came out of -- the y came out of Czechoslovakia, 

and the y were a super fami ly.  The y -- 
m y grandfather 
-- I have pictures of him flying to 
visit his factories i n 1929, pictures standi ng in front of an airplane, airline fl ying to 

places, and they -- m y grandmother's family 
--
 they -- Pet er Bogdanovich, the movie 
director,is partof my mother's 
-- 
m y grandmother's familyon my mother's side 
and -- and her sister was the first pharmacist in Czechoslovakia, you know, so the y 

were -- they were an achieving upper-class family.  And the y're very, very -- I love 

my
 -- m y grandparents.  They were classy people.   
Q: Sure.  Did you or your sister go to school before the war?  

A: 
My 
-- well, I wa s smal l but my sister went  to school.  

Q: Was it a Jewish school?  

A: No.  
Q: It was j ust a regular --  
A: Yeah.  

Q: -- older nation school?   

Interview with Paul Halpern 
 
7 
A: Politely put, even then we were i n a si mulated family.  There was, you 
know -- the -- 
m y 
-- my dad had Jewish friends and so on, but i t -- 
t heJewish Society was 
Jewish Society, but I was never aware that I was a Jew.  You know, we -- during the 

holidays and Passover, Yom Kippur, yeah, we did celebrate that, but usually at m y 
grandparent 's house.  
Q: 
I see.  Were 
you or your parent s aware of Nazi --  
A: 
Oh, yeah. 
 
Q: -- rise and what 
--
 what was thei r first --  
A: Once again -- once again, I'm thinking as a five-
year
-old, but I remember when 
Dollfuss was assassinated.  Dollfuss was a soci alist minister who was against the 

Anschluss.  And one day he was shot at a 
--
 shot at a vall e y and the ambulance came 
through and said, We'll  take hi m.  And the y loaded him i n the ambulance.  The y found 

hi m in the ambulance t wo days later dead when it was sun up.  And it was politi
cally v ery 

difficult ti me.  My father, I know for a fact about six or seven months before the 

Anschluss, one of his employees came in and he said, Mr. Halpern, I am a member of the 

Austrian Nazi Parti es, National Socialist Part y, and eventually, you know, it 's just  a 

mat ter of time before we come here and we need friends.  No Jewish questioned at all but 

we need friends and we need -- and so it's how about a contribution now, and my father 
had him thrown out, fired hi m and threw hi m out.  
Q: Did he mean, li ke, money?  

A: Well, yes.  Donation to the party to show good-will toward the part y and when right 

after the Anschluss, my dad came to work one day and he was sitting in his office and he 

Interview with Paul Halpern

said, You work for me now.  And for a while my dad -- m y dad did 
--
 m y dad di d 
go -- one of the good -- and then you know we -- we had a nanny, and we -- we used to 
go to the park and t hen we couldn't go into the park so -- t he nanny was Catholic and we 

would wal k around the park, and then we had t o wear arm bands.  
Q: Oh, oka y.   
A: 
And m y nanny 
-- I was upset t hat m y nanny didn't  wear one because, oh, you know, 

I'm sorry.  You can't have one of these arm bands, you know.  If you were Jewish you 

could wear one of these things, you know, and that summer we still went to camp in the 

Alps.  We still went to camp in the Alps.  I remember it was a vegetarian camp.  It was 

awful.  And I came down with appendicit is.  Could not find a doctor in the -- in the area 

to treat me.  So wit h a case of appendicitis, I went on the train back to Vienna, and the y 
wouldn't take me.  The hospital -- 
Iknowt hat from m y mother. And then m yappendix 
was taken out by a Jewish doctor i n his office.  You know, and he had kind of an 

operating room, and that was the first time I suddenly real ized that something was a litt le 

bit wrong.  And my sist er had to change school s, you know.  She coul dn't go to the 

school, and  -- but we li ved in a building where -- mostly Christians.  I -- I can't tell you, 

but I know -- I know that.  And in the fall of '38, our nanny was not al lowed to work for 

us anymore.  So now my debutante mother had to take us for walks and stuff.  And m y 
sister was at school , and m y mother said t o me, Let's go for a walk.  And she looked at 
me.  She said, Your shoe lace is untied.  So she literally stood me up on the dining room 

table.  Okay.  She was 4'11.  She stood me up on the dini ng room table so she could tie 

m y shoes.  And I'm st anding there, she's tying m y shoe, and the doorbell rings.  And two 

Interview with Paul Halpern

gentlemen come in, and it was right out of a -- right out of a German movie.  These two 
guys came i n, and t he y had rain coats and snap-bri m hats and the whole bit.  And the y 

said is -- is your husband here?  And m y mother said, No.  He's -- 
and m y mot herwas 

one of these very nervous people.  And she said, No.  He's not here.  They said, We need 
to look around.  And my mother said, Oka y.  And so the y walked in -- and I'm five years 
old and I'm toddling behind them.  I'm -- and t hey went into m y father's study which 

was I remember it because it had green shades you know, in the old days instead of white 

shades there was a green shade.  So the sunlight was alwa ys filtered and I remember 

distinctly one of them walking to my father's desk, reachi ng into his coat, taking out his 

gun, and la yi ng it on the floor under my father's desk.  And then the other one went over 

and said, Oh, what's thi s?  And he picked t he gun up and he turned to m y -- 
went to m y 
mother and said, Is this yours?  And my mother said, No.  And he said, Well, you're 
going to have to come with us.  And she said, Wel l, why?  He said, Wel l, do you have 

somebody who can take care of him?  And so m y mother went up and got one of 

the -- one of the nei ghbors to take care of me 'till my grandmother could come and collect 

us.  And t hat the last time I saw my mother and father 'till spring of 1941.  And the y went 

to the downtown Vienna prison, and I understand for the two years they were in the 

downtown Vienna prison they saw each ot her one time in the exercise yard and never 
talked.  But you have t o understand here is a woman who has had the best of everything 
and she's living in a wi ng with 200 women, one shower, no doors; one toilet, no doors.  

But through this entire time, m y former nanny used to come and collect her laundry and 

do her laundry for her, you know, what li ttle rags she had.  And she 
--
 it was just kind of 

Interview with Paul Halpern 
 
10 
different, you know.  So we -- we went to 
--
 we went to m y grandmot her's house and 
that's -- if you're goi ng to record thi s, this is -- m y grandfather, right after the Auschwitz 
and the troops were in the street, went on a normal business trip t o Switzerland.  And 
aboutthree dayslater, m y mother got
 -- m y grandmother got a letter.  And the let ter said, 
By the ti me you get thi s letter.  I'm on my wa y to the Uni ted States.  I am not coming 
back.  The y don't want you.  The y want me.  So sometime in the next week the y will 

come and sa y to you, Where's your husband?  And you show t hem this letter, and they're 

going to sa y, When is he coming back?  And you're going to sa y, He's not coming back.  

Just show them the letter, and event ually the y'll let you go because they don't  want you.  

Sign over anything they want, give them anything you want -- they want, and t he y'l l let 

you go
 -- because this i s still early on.  And th at's exact ly how it happened.  And so, 
finall y, after about by t he spring of '39, m y grandmother's arranging for us to go into 

Kindertransport, and they said, Just sign here.  Give us the bill and then sign over and get 

out.  And she said, Not until I put 
m y kids
 -- my grandkids on the train.  And they said, 
No, you have to get  out.  She said, No.  I'm not  getting out until t he y get on the train.  

That's how tough she was.  And she was the only member of my family who was over 

5'6, you know.  So she was the queen.  She put  us on the t rain, and she went to the United 

States; and she joi ned her husband who was -- he had guts.  I mean, he played -- 
he 
played with people's lives, but he -- he knew human nature.  He knew that as long as they 
got what they want ed t hey were going to -- and I went to England, and I remember 

the -- I remember the train ride.  And, you know, a little t hem -- them memories and I had 

m y father's brother was in London, and he had come to England with his wife, Auga (ph), 

Interview with Paul Halpern 
 
11 
as a domest ic.  They si gned on as a couple, and Auga (ph) came over pregnant.  So their 
son, Ralph, was born in England and was a British subject, and did very well.  He is a 

Lord of the British Emperor.  His name is Sir Ralph Halpern, and he was chairman of the 

board of Burton Industries, and he now lives in South Beach, and my -- m y son and he 
are good friends.  And I see them occasionally, and he was alwa ys a 
--
 always a Brit and 
he's always been a Brit.  Calls me Dear Boy and he's six years younger than I am.  And 
it's kind of racy, and I 
--
 he and I have a good t ime together.  And -- and but there was 
nowhere we could sta y in England -- we could sta y with him in London.  We'd sta y a 

couple of days, and then went down to Bunce Court and Dan (ph) Court 

to -- Kindertransport.  They made an arrangement for the kids who did not have -- weren't 

going to be taken there by families.  There was -- there were these estates out by Kent, 
and the y brought in an educator from Berli n named Anna Essinger and who was the most 
magnificent teacher.  I was there 16 months, and I sta yed in one school, and m y sister 

stayed in the other school.  And I can't tell you whether I was in B unce Court or Dan 

Court.  I think I was in Bunce Court because it  comes easier to my mi nd, but, you know, 

the me
mori es are strange.  All I know is that I did a lot of school ing because I jumped 
like three years when I came here immediately because the y thought I was a poor refugee 

kid until I -- I told them 
--
 they put me in the second grade.  I could read.  I could do 
mat h.  I -- I had a little bit of chemistry.  I knew European History because that's what 

that's what the regi men there was, and the -- 
they 
--
 the -- t he -- the bombings were pretty 
bad around that area because a lot of fighter bases were in that area, and we got sent to 

London and -- which is interesting because then the Brits started i n London for sure.  And 

Interview with Paul Halpern 
 
12 
the Brits -- Britains decided to have their own Kindertransport and, they went and signed 
up 30,000 children to get them first to the countryside and then to the colonies Australia, 

South Africa, New Zealand, Halifax.  And it was a little bit different.  And from what I'd 

been read
 -- what I read -- it was part of the government i n power at that ti me, and he said 
this is a mistake because the y have to go by boat.  And the -- the Germans controlled the 

seas.  And if we lose one boat, when the war is over, we will lose the election because 

that will be an issue.  And we were supposed t o go in December of -- September 10th or 

12th we were -- 
1940, we 
were supposed to go from London to Liverpool to catch a boat, 
and I remember we sat in the stati on -- in Vict oria Station because the air raids were very 

bad at that t i me, and we missed the boat.  And it was the City of Benares, and the City of 

Benares was a troop ship converted from a Cunard-White Star Line.  The City of Benares 
was sunk a three da ys later in the -- on its wa y -- wa y, and I think 89 children didn't die in 
the sinking but died of exposure to water.  It was a horrific thing.  And Churchill 
i
mmediately cancelled that
 -- and about 3500 
--
 there were books on that -- 
there were 
more books on that Kindertransport  than our Kindertransport because it was a different 

issue.  And we sta yed i n Liverpool , and four days later we -- we got on the SS Antonia 

which was a converted Cunard-White Star Line, and all I remember is we were the only 

two kids on the boat and we saw in the crew quarters and m y -- and for luck the y would 
play cards with us sitting on their lap.  And we were supposed to go t o New York, and 
there was a 
--
 there was a U-boat scare.  So we went to Montreal, and we arrived in 
September 30th, 1940.  And I got to see my first comics, and I can still remember 

the -- you know, Ameri cans comics was something usual.  And I -- I can tell you the 

Interview with Paul Halpern 
 
13 
story.  It was a Dick Tracy story, and I can do that when I get a smart -- I alwa ys -- I've 
always been trying to get the copy of that -- that particular page from September 30th so I 
could show -- 
and m y grandfather 
-- m y grandfather had us picked up in Montreal.  We 
got put on the train, and the first da y we were in -- in New York City, we went and 
applied for first citizen -- first papers because as far as everyone knew, m y parents were 
dead.  So m y grandfather was my guardian.  And we applied for first papers for -- for 

declaration, not to -- to get out of refugee status.  And I li ved in Forest Hills wit h 

my
 -- with m y grandmother, and my sister went to m y grandfather's brother who lived i n 
Kingston.  He was also quite wealt hy.  And it was a good life.  And I -- and I went to 

school in Forest Hills and I went to PS3, and t hey -- 
a week after m y teacher called my 

grandmother and said, He's seven and a half years old and he doesn't belong in the second 
grade.  We're goi ng to put him in the third grade.  So I finished that year, and the y said, 
We need to put hi m in t he fifth grade next year.  And m y -- 
and m y grandmother said, 

No.  He's -- he's a smart kid, but he needs -- he needs a little bit of respect.  He needs to 

be leveled off a little bi t.  He needs to be with his age.  You can put him in the fourth, but 

you can't put him -- you can't put hi m in the fifth.  So I was alwa ys earl y because of that.  

But m y grandmother was very -- very clever about that she said, you know, He needs 

peer pressure, and he's not going t o get it if he's a smart-alecky kid three years over his 
head.  And -- and then in his early 1941 my grandfather who was i n the -- he owned real 
estate, office buildings and apart ment houses.  They invested with -- with friends.  He 

was in RNS associates and he was visited by a member of the German litigation who said 

to hi m, Would you like to buy a couple of Jews?  And I think my grandfather alwa ys kind 

Interview with Paul Halpern 
 
14 
of said that that's basically what he said.  Would you like to buy somebody?  And m y 
grandfather said, Who?  And the y said, Your daughter and her husband.  And m y 

grandfather said, I sat shiver (ph) for them two years ago because my grandfather 

did -- was observant a l ittle then.  And the y sai d No, the y're alive.  They're alive.  And so 
an arrange ment was m ade.  And from what I understand, and I can't prove it, but I know 
that the fact that they had warehoused them for two years -- in the back of their mind, it 

was a product.  My -- 
m y 
-- it was a product t o be -- it was currency that could be 
converted at any ti me.  And an accommodation was made, and m y grandfather -- the 

doors opened in pri son, and the y told my mother and dad, 48 hours.  48 hours or -- and 

then right after that, the -- the rest of the peopl e went to -- within six months, the y were 
all gone to concentration camps.  They closed it up.  And the y went -- they did the route 
to Portugal , and the y were supposed to go to Argentina and -- and wait it out.  And the 
averagewait was,like, a year
-and-a-half, two years.  And my grandfather had 
v ery 

intelligent advisers, and one of them said to him, You know you're sponsoring your kids, 

but the y're grown people.  Your grandchil dren have status as first-paper Americans and 

they're refugees.  Have them sponsor their parents, m y mother and dad.  Because it 's a 

[compassionate] and no argument at all.  Imm ediately after we filed papers, immediately 

m y mother and dad came from Portugal t o the United St ates.  And it was -- there's an 
interesting bypass tothis
 -- this part of it.  If I ma y, m y dad worked his wa y, you 
know -- he did what he could, and he got some Austrian woman and m y mother the y 

crocheted the shopping bags.  You know, in Europe, the y used the net shopping bags 

which nobody in America did so the -- the Austrian ladies would sit there and embroider

--
 onto t his netting to make handbags.  And m y dad took t hem to 
Bloomingdale's and started to sell them -- you know, he was much of an entrepreneur, 
and he handled slippers, you know, that -- there were cottage made and he sold t hose, and 

then he got into the import/export business.  And in 1947, the American government 
called my dad in and they said -- you know, he had become a citizen 
--
 and the y said, 
You know your factories are gone.  Your fact ory was bombed because it was making 
rainwear but  your father-in-law who had died, his factory i s there i n Gupendolfush 

dausen (ph), but the equipment all  went east t o Russia, but it 's there.  Would you consi der 

coming back?  We can offer you projection as an American citizen, not a lot of protection 

because it was behi nd the iron curtain but 
--
 and we can't tell you that you can get any 
money on it right now, but it would help Austria come back on its feet and you have 
connections.And so my dad
 -- 
my
 -- 
my
 --  the family said, you know, everyb
ody yo u  
knew it like the -- t heir father's right-hand man, he went back starti ng in '47, went back 
and rebuilt Airkakli dafabrake (ph).  And about '49 m y mother started going back.  My 

father was not a happy man there.  I mean, you know, but my mother, bygones, bygones.  

It never occurred to her that all of her friends never lost a thing.  Still had the houses in 

the country.  Still 
--
 and she woul d -- it never -- the only wa y you could be that wa y is if 
you were one of them.  You know, and the y were all Christians.  And she -- 
she was 
friends with them 'till she died.  And she was 
--
 she was a little bit  different.  And I 
remember m y deb 
--  
they 
--
 they li ved in a ponceon (ph) right on Amgraddam (ph).  Do 
you know Vienna?  Amgraddam (ph) is the shopping district li ke Rodeo drive.  And I 
have -- I was  -- I was there just recently, last November, and I took pictures with 

Interview with Paul Halpern

my
 -- with m y grandson.  And she -- the y lived in a ponceon (ph) the whole ti me and 
she -- she just kept -- kept going.  She just enjoyed life again.  And when they were let 
out of prison, the first place the y went to was back 2 Elizabeth Street, and the y knocked 

on the door.  And the man opened the door, and my mother said she could see all her 
furniture.  And the man said, What do you want?  A
ndshesaid, Well, We usedto live 
here.  And he said, You don't live here anymore, and he sl ammed the door.  In about 

1962, '63, my mother and my dad are eating in a very fine restaurant  in Vienna, and my 

dad said -- and you have to remember, m y dad was about 5'3, 5'4.  He said to m y mother, 

Excuse me, and he l eft the table, and he wal ked to the table across the room where a 

gentlemen was eating with a woman.  And he said, You remember me?  And the guy 

said, No.  And he said, No.  You should remember me.  You lived in my apartment.  2 
Elizabeth Straße 1941, and I came t o the door and you slammed the door.  And he 
brought hi s voice up a notch, and the guy said, I don't  remember.  And m y 

grandfather -- m y father, very quiet ly, said, Oh, you must remember me, and repeated the 

story at a hi gher voice.  And when he got to where he was talking very loudly, t he man 

called for his check and he left.  And m y dad went back t o table, put his napkin in his l ap, 

said, Let 's eat.  And that -- that's a marvelous story because m y dad -- m y dad was a very 

quiet man.  Greatest American that  live lived, most patri otic American that ever l ived.  
Loved this country.  And the only protecti on they had was he lived in the -- he lived -- the 
factory was in the 5th district.  He lived in the second district.  He lived in the first 

district -- first or second then he moved to the first district when m y mother move -- 
came 

in.  And, you know, because of the McCarran-Walter Act, he could not be out of this

country six months and a da y, you know, naturalized citizens had to, you know -- had to 
be here for at least -- then he had to stay here six months, and it was just an 

inconvenience to hi m.  I mean, he -- he said, I'm not going nowhere.  I'm an American 

citizen, and I'm 
--
 you know, I'm doing this.  And he did very well in the factories, and he 
actually was able -- 
I was
 -- I was i n Germany working in  -- I was  -- I was in the Air 
Force, and I was the German-American Press Officer for the Air Forces of Europe.  And 

when I got that assignment, I called my dad in Vienna, and I said, Li sten.  I can get out of 

this job.  All I've got t o do is tell them who -- t hat you spent ti me in a German pri son.  

And m y dad said, 20 years is too l ong to hate.  I'll meet you i n Frankfort.  And 

Dietzenbach (ph
) is right outside Frankfort, and they would come and they woul d spend 

some ti me.  My mother loved that we lived up in the mountains i n a -- at a cor or (ph), 
you know, and the y would go in t he afternoon, listen to music.  My dad was never happy 
in Germany, but he -- 
he 
-- he believed in his principle.  Hi s princi ple was, It's 20 years.  

You got to do what you got to do.  And he was very proud of the fact that I was 
--
 that I 
could do that.  And I do have to tell you one 
--
 and I -- I'm digressing, but you know, 
I -- I've done thi s before.  I tell stories.  I was the informat ion officer Dietzenbach (ph) air 

base.  And among t he t hings that we had was the Glendola (ph) band of Europe, the Air 

Force band, which is equivalent t o the -- t he air force band that 's in Washington, D.C., 
and the -- was the same band that Miller conducted when he was lost.  And they pla yed 
from Glen Miller (ph) music, the y played from Glen Aus (ph).  And I would -- 
because I 
spoke German, and I would take t hem on 
--
 I would be -- I woul d be their press office, 
and I woul d do Voice of America Interviews, and we went  on a Red Cross tour of

Austria, and we ended up in Vienna pla yi ng at the concert hall wit h 2,000 seats.  And the 
concery (ph) had some problems because it  was during the Vietnam War.  And when we 

came on the stage, there were two empty rows which is really frightening.  You know, I 

mean, it's -- it implied threat, and it was a 49-piece brass concert band, really 
unbelievably good music.  And the y -- I -- I di d the announcing.  I did the announcing for 
this one.  And after about three numbers in the audience, they had j ust  pla yed the Braums 

Academic Festival Overture (ph), and peopl e said, That 's -- that's not a oompa (ph) band, 

and I came on and m y German was pretty good, but I had a script .  And I said, You're 

going to have to excuse me because I need t his paper.  I sai d, From my accent you 

probably can't tell that I was born in this country, and I got a lot of applause.  I said, As a 

mat ter of fact, I was born in this city, and I got  a lot of applause.  And I said, As a matter 
of fact, m y mother and m y father are sitting right there; m y mother and my father with 
four friends are sitting t here.  And my mot her's down like this.  And I said -- I said, now, 

I'm not a musician, but  I think what you will agree that these gentlem en are -- and 

everybody, yes, because they were magnificent.  And I said, therefore, for m y mother in 

the city of m y birth, My Fair Lady, and the y played.  And m y mother is crying awa y, you 

know.  And -- 
but to
 gi ve you an i dea of what kind of a debutante m y mother was -- now 

we're tal king about '68 so m y mot her's 63 years old, and she comes back stage wit h m y 
dad.  And I introduce t hem to m y conduct or, and she sai d, Woul d you have -- we're 
having a little coffee at the Intercontinental Hotel, which is one block from the course 

(ph).  We would love it  if you and the conduct or, Miche Delfonso (ph), and the first chair 

would join us for coffee.  I'm her son.  I -- we've been touring Austria, walking around al l 

Interview with Paul Halpern 
 
19 
d ay.
  And she never mentioned it until she was there.  So I did a Voice of America 
interview, and we walked down the street.  And, you know, the y're great musicians, but 
Vienna appreciates good music.  And the restaurant was filled wit h people who had been 

at this concert.  And we did Glen Miller (ph) t he whole after the -- and as we walked in, 
when the conductor walked in, everybody stood up and applauded.  And you know what  
a good feeling that i s for a professional musician who's a military man to be appl auded.  

Not because he was a Air Force officer, but because he was the conductor of a really 

good orchestra.  And we had this wonderful di nner.  And -- and I mean, wonderful 
coffee 

and shla (ph) coffee ve shla (ph).  And then my -- m y dad, in '68, I was getting ready to 

come back t o the United States in -- in '69, I was coming back, early '69.  He said, I'm 

tired.  He's 76.  It's '68.  He came back and he said, It's my last trip.  We -- we 
sold -- we've sold it to the European part of family.  We've gotten our mone y out.  I'm 
going to retire.  And he was dead i n two months.  Couldn't 
--
 came home, had a stroke.  
And I think if he had worked, he would have kept on working because that was his -- and 

m y mother 
-- m y mother lived another -- 
76
 --  60 was when he died, she was 62.  And 
she died at 94.  She lived another 32 years and went back to Vienna.  She went back to 

Vienna when she was 91 years old.  And she would go to co orts (ph).  She went to 

Shroonz (ph), and she kept those forshluganuh (ph) people as friends all her life.  And it 
was -- it was -- it's an interesting thing.  But I -- I'm li ttle different about it.  I don't 
--
 I 
don't know -- I, you know, I -- I meet peopl e and they ask me about -- and I do tal k on the 
Holocaust.  And they say t o me, What do you remember?  And I said, I've read some of 

these books.  Some of these books are, like, these 5-
year
-old children will have an 

Interview with Paul Halpern 
 
20 
epiphany, Oh, I was tot ally aware of this and that.  That 's -- that's bol ogna because at age 
five it's a guess.  It's -- it's fun.  I remember sit ting in my back yard in London and 

watching Lufbafa (ph) fight the RAF, and I thought it was wonderful, you know.  

And -- and riding on the train with Zowy (ph), you know -- and so my mother wasn't 
there to annoy me, and m y father was -- was never home anyhow; and I thought  it was 
wonderful.  Oh, I'm sorry.  And I t hought it was wonderful.  

Q: 
Did you
 -- did you speak any English at  all by the age of five?  

A: I spoke no English 
--
  
Q: Uh-huh.   

A: -- but within three weeks in the -- in -- because Bunt s Court, English only.  English 

only.  So people sa y, What do you remember?  I say, Well, I remember Bunts Court  
school.  I remember that one of my roommates was named Wolfe, and he ate paper.  If he 
needed attention, he ate paper.  I remember when I turned seven years of age, I had m y 

teddy bear named Peter.  And in order to prove that I was a man, I flushed Peter down the 

toilet.  These are the thi ngs I remember, and, yet, it was such a si gnificant ti me.  

But -- it 's not lost on children, but our reacti ons -- if you put 90 percent of these people 

back into a hypnotic trance and ask them to repeat the thi ngs that they've tol d you, they 

would sa y, Well, I think that happened, but it's all post-knowledge.  You learn about what 
you've done later.  But for kids -- 
peopleal ways tell me
 -- you know, I -- I flew combat, I 
flew 130 missions in Vietnam, and I lost a lot of friends.  And people sa y to me, Do you 
have any regrets?  Because a lot of these people -- w
hy me?Why did my mother 
-- 
m y 
mother didn't l ove me.  She kept my sister and let me go.  That doesn't make any sense to 

Interview with Paul Halpern 
 
21 
me.  And I always say t o the people, Look.  The question always comes up.  How do you 
feel?  I said, I am very sorry for your loss, and I am very sorry that  they didn't make it.  I 

will not sa y that I am -- I wish it were me because I do not.  I am very glad that I did 

make it.  It 's the luck of the draw.  And if -- I couldn't survive if I didn't think that wa y.  I 
couldn't think that wa y.  And yet it's difficult.  These people -- 
m y 
--
 m y capadres (ph) 
here in their 80s -- and then, you know, we're reasonably young because you couldn't  
have been born before '23.  So our oldest are onl y 87 years old, and that's young because 

there are a lot of Holocaust survivors, and it's a horrible thing.  I mean, we were not 

scathed.  We weren't scarred and we weren't beaten, and we -- we -- we -- you know, but 
it's tough because many of these people lost so many people and -- but I have no guilt, no 

regrets at all.  I -- I couldn't -- 
I'm re
asonably upbeat, and I couldn't be that wa y if I 
thought that wa y.  There you have m y story.   

Q: Thank you very much.  I woul d just like to --  

A: Sure. 

Q: -- go back a little bit to Vienna and to Engl and.   

A: Sure. 

Q: First of all, m y question is, was it your grandmother's decision to send you by 

Kindertransport?  
A: No.  My grandfather proudly found out the Kindertransport was going, and it's 
interesting.  I've met some people here -- I j ust  had breakfast with a gentleman who said 

he came from a poor family in Vienna.  You have to remember that  the Austrian Jew 

was -- of that ti me was pretty uneducated because there were not a lot  of us, but the 

Interview with Paul Halpern 
 
22 
Austrian was -- Vienna was an intelligent city any
how,and most of 
-- most of the Jews 
were upper- middle class.  But he said he was 
--
 he was son of a salesman, and he was 
poor.  But he was a stat eless pole (ph), and that -- that wa y he was able to go late.  The 
first two or three trains, from what I understand, were filled with people whose children 
are people of  influence.  Once again, I don't regret it.  I'm not sorry that my grandparents 
had mone y. 
 

Q: Do you know t hat t hey had to pa y a lot  of mone y for --  

A: I would  --  

Q: -- you t o --  
A: -- i magi ne some money changed hands.  Ei ther that or m y grandfather just by status, 

just by stat us had enough -- he -- he wasn't a super observant Jew, but I know he 
belonged to the biggest  synagogue in Vienna and, you know, and he 
--
 that's how the lists 
were madet hrough there. 
 
Q: 
Do youknow what organization managed Kin
dertransports in Vienna?  
A: No.  I'm five.  I'm six.   

Q: Yeah.  Sure.  Do you -- do you know if your parents knew that  you were being sent to 

England when the y were in jail?  

A: Yeah because the -- the -- it was a one-way street because we didn't know th
e y were 
alive.  Yeah.  Basically in the begi nning 
because m y 
-- our nanny's name was Resi, 
R-e-s-i, and she was married to a guy named Pepe, P-e-p-e, and he was a phot ographer.  

And I'm a phot ographer, and I have a lot of old pictures you know, of us in the -- the 

mountains.  And because wherever we went , t he nanny went, and wherever the nanny 

Interview with Paul Halpern 
 
23 
went, the boyfriend went.  And I have pict ures of m yself in you know in La y De Hoison 
(ph) up in the -- in the Alps and so news, m y grandparents were informed because the y 

would supply the money to Resi -- they would pay a little bit to go visit m y mother, and 

pick up the -- which is -- if I tell you that somebody was in prison and somebody 
had -- had --  had a private person t o do their laundry, you wouldn't -- but it was done.  It 
was done.  Not anymore, it couldn't be done that way.   
Q: Do you know if your grandparents could vi sit their children --  

A: No.  

Q: -- in the prison?  No?   

A: No.  My grandfather was -- m y grandfather was already -- he left right after the 

Anschluss.  He went to the United States, so m y grandmother ran the show, but m y 
grandmother alwa ys ran the show.  But she was the perfect wife.  And she was everything 
m y mother was not.  My kids loved my grandmother.  The y loved my mother too because 

there was gifts.  My mother's favorite two hol ida ys were Easter and Christ mas.  This i s 

from a Jewish woman.  You know, and we always had a Christ mas t ree because she 

loved Christ mas.  But she always had Passover, but --  

Q: It was Christian Christ mas, right
? 
 

A: Of course.  Of course.  She liked -- she would visit us right around Passover.  Come 
for Passover.  And I was military so I -- st ationary, and she would bring battachini (ph) 
and botten (ph) kosher candy for the holidays and chocolat e bunnies -- Easter bunnies for 

the kids.  She was -- if somebody would've played my mother in a movie, it would be 

Betty Whit e because -- or -- or even  -- or -- 
she 
-- 
shewas alittle bit oblivious, andshe 

Interview with Paul Halpern 
 
24 
was an absolute expert on opera.  She was an absolute expert on al l this stuff and life just 
flew, you know.  She just -- and she was always like that , and she was totally oblivious of 

the world situation.  And when I went to Viet nam and m y wife was in Columbus, Ohi o, 

with a friend, and she would get a telephone call f
rom m y mother. And she'dsa y, Was 
that Paul?  And Betty'd sa y, What are you t alking about?  She said, An airplane crashed 

in Chicago.  Military ai rplane cashed in Chicago.  A mili tary airplane went down in 

Germany.  Was that  Paul?  And she'd sa y, Mom, thank you for telling me, but, look, if 

I -- it's not Viet nam.  If it's Vietnam, before you know it, I know it because the military 

takes care of its own.  It would be horrible, and you would hear the news from me, not 

from a newspaper.  You have to stop call
i ng me because when you dothat you're 

worrying yourself to death over nothing because he's not -- he's not in Germany and he's 
not in Chicago.  He's i n Vietnam.  And the news comes out, I get  it before you.  But she 
was oblivi ous of the world situati on like that.  And she just went  through life -- she was 

the perfect -- she was t he perfect candid (ph).  You know the Panglossian theory of we're 

living in t he best of all possible worlds.  And here's -- two years in a German defangnus 

(ph) who i s friends, stays friends with the people who did not visit her when she was 

there.  That 
--
 nobody visited them, but it was just two i nopport une years in her life.  
Q: That's great.   
A: It's unrealistic and she -- m y si ster ended up -- m y sister died earl y.  She was a 
psychiatrist.  She was 
--
 I mean, she was a doctor, and she was a psychiatrist who became 
nonfunctioning.  She was so -- she was so bipolar that she ended up being on social -- she 

was -- went  on soci al security because she could not -- could not work, and she died at 

Interview with Paul Halpern 
 
25 
the age -- one week short of her 70th birt hda y.  And I've taken both her daughters in 
as -- put them into my fami ly.  But m y -- m y kids remember m y grandmother fondly -- I 
mean, my motherfondly
 
because she br
ought them present s, but they remember m y 
grandmother with l ove because the y remember this wonderful, wonderful woman 
who -- who died in '96 and who was just regal.  She just floated.  But I used to sit in 
Forest Hill s -- I -- i n Jackson Heights.  I used to sit in her apart ment and watch her make 

strudel.  Now this woman who had the best of all possibl e worlds could make the best 

damn strudel in the world and she would sit there with me sitting at her -- sitting at the 

table, and she woul d roll this -- and that's -- those are memories.  Those are great 

memories for me, and not -- I wish it was my mother, but it wasn't.  It was my 

grandmother that I remember these great thi ngs about.  And my 
--
 m y mother was just -- I 
ended up being the -- she lived number one Li ncoln Center looking down into t he opera 

house.  It 's 2164 Street, and she had 24/7 help because she -- she was getting ill.  She was 

getting older.  And when she stopped looking out the window -- because the view was 

magnificent, you could look out into the Lincoln Center, we kidnapped her and brought 

her to -- brought her to Moorestown, New Jersey, and we put her i nto -- into the 

Evergreens which is a marvelous senior community nursing home.  She lasted six 

months, and -- 
let me
 -- have I -- have I got a minute thi s-- this 
--
 this  --  
Q: Yes, you have.  If you want to take a break at any ti me just let  me know.   

A: I'm a talker.  The -- I brought her -- we kidnapped her.  We brought her to this very, 

very elegant -- it was a Presbyterian home -- 
a 
Pescable (ph) home but  it was beautiful.  
And she -- m y mot her even said, This was very el egant, which is, from her words, a real 

Interview with Paul Halpern 
 
26 
compli ment.  And I took up the first day, and I put her in a wheelchair so I could 
mobile -- she could wal k, but -- and we walk --  we sat out in the gardens and we were 

sitting there looking -- and this is September, and she says to me, When is -- when is 

Easter?  This is a Jewish woman.  And I'm sitt ing there and I said, Well, Ma, let's see.  
This is September.  We just had Labor Day.  Thanksgiving is coming up.  And t hen 
and -- and I said then Hanukah, and I'm trying to be Jewish, and she -- and I said, And 

then it's Christmas.  And I said, Valentine's Day and then comes Easter.  And the next 

time I came in, she said to me, What time is it?  And I sai d, It's 9:00.  And she said, 

Morning or evening?  And I would sa y, If it was 9:00 in the evening, both of us woul d be 

in bed.  She would sa y, When is Easter?  And I would go through that same thing.  If I 

came in the afternoon and she'd say, What time is it?  And I'd sa y, 4: 00.  She'd sa y, 
Morning or afternoon?  And I'd sa y, If it was morning, I would 
--
 you and I would both 
be in bed.  When is Easter?  My mother died on Easter morning.  And I don't believe in 
this.  I don't believe i
n the
 m ystic.  But it was j ust -- why would a littl e Jewish woman 

with no connections to Easter want to know when Easter was coming?  And she died on 

Easter morning.   

Q: That's incredible.   

A: It -- it is.  And my mother was not a m ystic.  And she was 94, and she had a very good 
life, including -- I mean, excluding two years, but those don't count.  In her mind, my 
mother was 92.  She forgot those three years.  I would imagine.  She never talked about 

it.  My dad never talked about it either.  And it must have been hard.  It must have been 

harder because of the fact that it was a debasi ng experience for somebody who is not used 

Interview with Paul Halpern 
 
27 
to being debased.  We only lost one relati ve, and that was my Uncle Jacque (ph) who was 
the third brother.  And he -- I think he died of Daha (ph).  And -- and then, of course, you 

know, further-out people, but there weren't a l ot of us.  We were a very small family.  

Now we're a big family.  I have nine grandsons.  Five of them have my name.  So, you 
know, that's -- t hat's good.  No.  As a matt er of fact, six of them have m y name.  And they 
range from 25 to 7 and they're a joy.  The y're my -- 
the y're my
 -- they're my boys, and I 
have a good relationshi p with them.  And I have the mone y and t he 
--
 you know, I have 
the ti me and the money, and I -- and we -- we do things t ogether.  And my -- 
m y 
grandson has invited me to come -- he's a skydiver.  He wants me to skydive.  And I don't 

think I'm going to do that.  I'm a little bit too old for that.  I don't feel old.  I don't feel old.  

It's been an interesting life.  I mean, I've had -- I lost my wife two years ago after 54 
years, and I moved i nto a -- I moved out of -- I lived in a senior C CRC (ph), went from 
the Jewish generation of Cherry Hi ll, South Jersey Federation, and I was up the b oard.  I 

was among the original  tenants at this place, and I was on a board, and I fought a good 

fight against them, you know, and I'm still very good friends wit h all the people t here.  

And when my wife died, I -- it was perpetual shiver, you know, and I just couldn't do that 

anymore so I moved on.  And I still -- I still go over and help install -- I set up the sound 

systems and
 -- because I was a graphic desi gner so I -- you know, I di d -- well, ma ybe I 
should touch the fact that I went from Ohio St ate University direct ly into the Air Force.  I 

spent 20 years in t he Air Force as a flyer, as an informati on officer, as an intelligence 

officer.  And when I got out, m y wife and I opened a copy shop, and t hen we ended 

up -- 
there were 
-- we started with just my wife and I, and when we sold 26 years later, 

Interview with Paul Halpern 
 
28 
we had 11 people.  And my wife was the t reasurer, so I have all t he money I ever need for 
rest of my l ife because she -- I -- 
I wasthe schmoos(ph) andshe was the 
-- she was the 

business end, and we were a good team.  And m y kids after about eight months, the y said 

to me, I was -- I was sour and I needed to soci alize.  So I said to m y daughter, Define 
socialize.  And she said, How old are you?  And I said, I understand.  I said, what  do your 
brothers thi nk?  She said, they put me up to thi s.  The y're afraid of you.  So I -- I have 

been seeing people, and I have got ten into a relationship with a widow who is 

superintendent of schools of Donna Woodridge -- was.  And we 
--
 we have a mutual 
respect for each other.  We've compartmentali zed that part of our lives, and she's Jewish 
and I'm back to -- now I go to show Frida y nights because she goes to show.  She keeps 

Kosher.  She keeps Kosher so I represent t hat in her home.  We -- she doesn't keep 
Kosher out , and she doesn't -- you know, when she comes to visit me.  But I'm back to 
being a Jew which I reall y never was.  You know, as mi litary man, I used to get a lot of, 

What's a good Jewish boy doing i n the Army?  And I said, Air Force.  And there i s a lot 

of them.  Like Jews represent, what, one half or one percent of the population in this 

country, small part.  My grandson is an Air Force Academy graduate.  

Seven
 -- seven -- al most eight percent of the class was Jewish which is anomaly, but it 's 
not.  It's a good life -- 
I mean
 -- and I did it  because kind of -- 
Ikind of feel, you save my 
life -- I felt like m y dad.  You saved m y life.  Let me pa y you back.  And I enjoyed m y 

mil itary life.  It was hard on m y wife, but I don't regret i t.   

Q: Great.  Thank you.   

A: Oka y.   

Interview with Paul Halpern

Q: Yeah.  I just have --  
A: 
Please.
 
Q: I would like to return back to England now.   

A: Oka y.   
Q: Do you remember how you were treated in England those years you had to spend 
there?  

A: Never left the campus the year and a half --  
the year and a h
alf  --  
Q: Did you make some friends there?  

A: Not permanent.  And I -- once in a while, t here were people here who tell me they 

were in Bunts Court when I was t here.  I do not rememberer.  I do not remember.  I do 

remember that m y sister -- there I hit her in the head with a rock because she was 
tormenting me.  She was trying to be m y mother, and I threw a rock and I caught  her 
right between -- right between the e yes.  And 
--
 and I -- to this da y, I t hink it was a 200 
feet, but it was probabl y fi ve feet.  But like I said, it's -- it's -- it's interesting.  It's hard.  

Everything is hindsight .  You -- I have gli mpses, and I remember we used to -- for tea, 

we would t oast bread at the fireplace.  We had a long fork, and we would toast bread.  

And I remember classes were really -- I mean, we learned 
--
 I mean, i t was -- it was a 
British boarding school run by a -- a -- a Germ an martinet, you know, who really ran a 
tough school.  But we weren't beaten; we weren't abused.  And I don't ever ever 
remember going into town.  I know we did.  I don't remember it.  I don't care.  You know, 

I do -- I do remember when we moved to -- when we -- when the school moved.  I think 

they went t o Shropshire (ph).  We came to London, and we sta yed wi th m y uncle in 

Interview with Paul Halpern 
 
30 
London.  And I remember the Blitz (ph) and i n the beginning, we used to go every day 
down to the -- the shelters and the subwa ys, and then after a while with -- you get hit, you 

get hit, you know.  

Q: Was thi s school onl y for Kindertransport kids?  
A: Yes.  
Q: 
Jewish kids? 
 
A: Yes.  If you were -- there's a very good book called My Heart 's in a Suitcase.  Anne 

Fox wrote it and she's here.  And she was at Bunts Court, and there's a whole chapter on 

Bunts Court.  And I thi nk Anne is a little bit ol der than I am.  But, once again, it's 

reconstructionist history because you cannot remember methodol ogy, and you cannot 

remember motivation when you're five and six.  You remember the good times.  
Q: Were you missi ng your parents or grandparents there?  Do you remember your 
thoughts a bout them?  

A: When I came to the United States, m y sister al most i mmediately went to Kingston, 

and I was angry because Kingston was -- New York City; but I 
--
 I lived with my 
grandparent s in Forest Hills, and I -- we were in an apartment buil ding there we didn't 

own which is really funny.  My grandfather didn't own this one.  It was really -- it  was in 

the right off -- right off Greens Boulevard and I walked to school and I had a nice life.  
And I -- I never -- because of the fact that my family was a little bit disjointed to start 
with, my mother was t he ulti mate intrarude (ph).  I mean 
--
 I mean, it -- she was a 
hadanist (ph).  She enj oyed her life, and she would -- she had a nanny for us, you know.  

Until the da y she went to prison, she had a nanny -- 
an
d she -- for the good ti mes.  But 

Interview with Paul Halpern 
 
31 
m y sister was already manifesting signs of bipolarism.  When she got difficult, she would 
say to the nanny, You need to take her out.  And that -- that's, you know, and that of 

course effected it.  So my connections wi th my parents was a littl e bit different 

than -- 
and m y dad wasabusiness man. And my
 -- when I was born, he was 43, and we 
really didn't talk.  And when we came to the United States, it was a little bit too l ate.  

His -- I'm -- he's 51; I'm 8, 9.  But later on in life, we became friends.  We became good 

friends.   

Q: Did you happen to forget German when you got -- 
at al l
 -- in Engl and or --  
A: No.  

Q: -- was it  --  

A: To this da y -- well, you know, when I came back and I -- I becam e the Dutch 
Americana shu press officer (ph), I had to -- m y German got better again, and I got to the 

point where I could -- but I used to use words and people'd say, Where'd you get that 

word?  And I'd say, well, I'm Austrian.  Yeah, but you left when you were six.  What 

six-
year
-old child sa ys Auskasidenidt (ph)?  You know?  Or, you know, I -- I had a hell 
of a vocabulary.  You know, I was a -- I was a precocious brat.  I know that because I was 

a spoiled kid, and m y sister -- m y sister was probably smarter than I was.  I mean, 

she -- she became a doctor, and she -- you know, she was a good student and everything 
else, but I don't regret what I do.  I have a Master's degree, and I'm in public relat ions; 
and I -- I have good fri ends and I 
--
 but not -- not as many as I should have because it's 
kind of the military rest riction, and you move on and you go someplace else.  And I've 

adopted a lot of -- m y lady friends, for instance, she's had 60 years and it's different life.  

Interview with Paul Halpern 
 
32 
It's a good life, but it 's 
--
 it's enjoyable.  And I enjoy being around -- and it's a solid 
Jewish community.  I mean, these are -- one of them is a Holocaust survivor, and we all, 
you know -- the y --  they -- they -- t he y just sit around and drink coffee and -- 
and play 
cards and -- and talk about nothing hours on end, but it's -- I like it.  I  -- I like it.  And 
then Shelly and I go to -- go to the theater or we go to a museum, and then we go back 
and we -- and we go to a dance, you know, and -- and it 's become -- I'm ready for that.  

I've never really had that.  And I've got m y kids as friends, and I -- I enjoy my l ife.   

Q: Great.  Well, Mr. Halpern, now we have to pause and change tracks here.  We'll j ust 

pause it.  
End of File One 
Beginning File Two 
Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memori al interview of Paul Felix 

Halpern conducted by Juliet Danilian on October 17th of 2010 at the Kindertransport 

Association Conference in Arlingt on, Virginia. So I would like to get back to the 
ti me 
when you first came to the states. Do you remember your first impression like what were 

your thoughts and what  can you think about your experience in being i n England and this 

Holocaust ordeal?
 
A: New adventure. You know, once again I'm eight years old now and I'm -- and I -- 
I 
spoke perfect Engli sh by t hat time. And the thi ng that I remember t he most of all was I 
came into Montreal. And as I told you that my fi rst impression was t he Dick Trac y 

comics and the Tarzan comics and that started m y love for comics real early at that time. 

But I got i nto the habit of reading billboards. You know, these roads signs and my 

Interview with Paul Halpern 
 
33 
English -- if I didn't know what the word meant, you know, American, American English 
is different than English English. You know, t here was si gns for everyt hing. But I was 

fascinated but I remem ber on the train reading all the billboards. And nobody in m y 

family 
-- m y grandfather didn't need a car. In New York you don't know a car. But if we 
travel I read, I would read the subway, the billboards. And I enjoyed t he new experience. 
And I fit in pretty well. School -- m y sister was a little bit abrasive. Li ke I say she was 

functioning. And but I was, I made friends easil y. And m y best friend was named -- and 

no Jewish kid should ever be named Palmer Kelpel man. Who knows a Jewish ki d 

Pal mer, P-A-L-M- E-R. Pal mer Kel pelman and I got into more trouble. We would ride, 
we would ride our ride bikes. We would ri de our bikes through Forest Hills. And we were 

-- we woul d go int o the candy store and swipe can
dy.
 I mean, not because we needed 
candy but because you could do that. And I ran into Pal mer like don't ask me where it 

was but I t hink we were about 40 years ol d at the time.He was the most boring, stuffy 

person that I've ever met in m y life. You know, he was j ust -- it was just funny that out  of 

that, that one thing Palmer was a bore. And then I ran, I had a friend named Lee Levine.  

And Lee's father owned Peter Pan bakeries of New York City.The y ran up to about 200 

stores and t hen there was problems and then they came back. And I road a tric ycle 

because the y wouldn't give me a bic ycle. And Lee had a bicycle. And we ran all around 
Forest Hill s, you know. And years later, m y middle son was 14. So thi s is 36 years ago, 
we sent hi m to a sports camp. We sent m y middle son to a sports camp at Tom Castella, 

he used to be a football  pla yer. And we went up to visit hi m and he said, "Dad, you know 

somebody named Lee Lavine?" And I said, "That's a name out of the past from when I 

Interview with Paul Halpern 
 
34 
was eight years old. 
Nine years old
." He said, "His son is here." And Lee, his father flies 
in to visit him every couple of weeks. He was like there six weeks. "And he takes us out." 
And I said, "You sure i t's the same guy?" Well, he said, "I don't know but he owns all 

these bakeries named 
--
" and I said, "Pet er Pan." "Yeah." So you know, there one, one 
kid becomes -- 
one kid becomes 
-- and the t hird one of my group was a kid name Richy 
Raskind. And Richy Raskind, his father was an ophthal mologist . And I started to learn 

how to fl y in the Civil Air Patrol and he was also -- and he crashed. And he became -- I 
visited hi m.  He was -- and he crashed out in Long Island. And he was like 
16 like I was and he survived, you know.And had some plastic surgery done. We used t o 

pla y at his house all the time. And he was quite wealthy and I was just, you know, I was a 

little kid down the block who lived with his grandparents. And he turned into -- he 
became Renee Richards. You know who Renee Richards i s? That's the sex change 
tennis player.So Richy Raskind became Renee Richards, which I guess was some weird 

friends. And among my childhood friends Mi ke Nichols, the director, and m y si ster were 

an item. My mother and dad used to go t o Tanner's Fi eld (ph) room. And to celebrate 

where you sat on the porch, you know, you rocked on the porch and t hey did bri ng us up 

there.  And the people -- Ms. Nichols owned it. Owned the place. And Mike and Bobby 

were her sons and t he y kind of helped out there. And m y si ster and he -- and years later, 
years later he went to t he University of Chicago. Left for years lat er I'm in Oklahoma and 

I'm at t he University, and I have to fl y, I have to fl y to get my fl yi ng pay. We didn't have 

to do any work so I bought a Pla yboy Magazi ne with an interview with Michael Nichols. 

So I'm reading this thing. And I began to laugh. And somebody said, "What are you 

Interview with Paul Halpern 
 
35 
laughing at?"I said, "My sister just made Playboy." And they said, "You're kiddi ng. Let's 
see."  And the y asked Mi chael Nichols, "Do you remember your first sexual 
experience?" And he des cribes the area behind, the woods behind Tanner's field where 
the flash was.And he sai d, he goes to this entire thing, you know, but and he sai d, "I was, 
I was 16 and she was 18." You know, and he sa ys, "You always remember your first 
experience," you know. And I came back from having to getting that. So I called m y 

mother and I said, "Hi, mom. Listen, you might want to get a copy of Pla yboy 

Magazine." And said, "I know." And I sai d, "Oh, really. How do you know?" She said, 

"One of m y friends tol d me." I said, "She's not your friend, mom." And she said, "Yes, 

but you thi nk it 's really Lucie?" I said, "Mom. Tanner's Field, New York?"  

"Well, she wasn't 18. She was only 17." I said, "Mom, who cares." Then I called m y 
sister.  And I said, "Hey, Mike Nichols remembers you fondl y." And she said, "Send me a 
copy." I said, "The hell wi th you. You know, buy your own copy." But so that 's another 
clai m to fame I have that my sister was -- Michael Nichol s as first big -- and he is 

magnificent, you know.  He's a good director. He was a good comedi an. I mean he did 

the Graduate. He did, you know, we know a few famous people. Like I said Peter 

Danovich's his family. And friend Zimmerman who died. He directed High Noon and 

directed Oklahoma. He was a Viet namese. And he used 
tovisit my motherbecause m y 
grandmother and m y --  and Fred's mother were friends in Vienna. And any time he was 
in New York he would come and see m y mother. He never talked fil m because my 

mother didn't understand films.  

Q: Only Opera? 

Interview with Paul Halpern 
 
36 
A: Let's not tal k trains. You know, but so m y claim to fame, the famous people I know 
are all, are all  directors. All of them, all of them won Academy Awards. So it was a good 

life. And then when my parents came, we moved. We got  an apart m ent in the same 

apartment house that my grandparents lived. So if I had enough of m y mother I would go 
upand see, visit m y grandmother.
 And m y mother was tot all y oblivi ous but she did work 
hard.  Let me put it this way here was this mom who used to -- 
m y mother 
-- 
one year 
when she was young in Vienna I understand took a course in stringing pearls. What kind 
of a job is that? But m y mother could string pearls. She couldn't cook but she could -- and 

she was quite -- she was -- you probably gathered that I'm not that much of a fan of my 

mother's. I have a Gall e Vase. Gall e is really 
--
 and it belonged to my mother. It was 
given to her by a gentleman who I met. Who was about 10 years ol der than m y mother. 
And like she always used to talk about thi s guy and the la moor (ph).And I finally met 
hi m in Switzerland and I know just in m y heart that it had been more than a friendship. 

And so I have this Galle vase which is kind of irritating. It's beautiful. And it is out with 

the antique, some of the antique dealers from the antique dealers, I'm tryi ng to get a 

decent estimate price for it to place it. I'm not going to pass that onto m y, to my kids. But 

and I don't need the money.And what I will do wit h that mone y is that money I will -- 

eventually i t will go in my estate, my three kids can have t he mo
ney.
I don't want to give 
anybody that vase. I just want to give them the money. And so I was up, I was up i n 
Landenville, (ph) and t hey said, "You have any provenance (ph) for t his?" "I said, 

"Yeah.This is a vase that m y mother's boyfri end gave to her." And the y said, "Excuse 

Interview with Paul Halpern 
 
37 
me?"
 I said, "Yeah, don't ask." But we live a ki nd of strange life. I've alwa ys been this 
kind of a wacky person. 
Q: Well, your Hol ocaust experience sounds like one big adventure for you. Do you have 

like some negative memories or were you realizing what  was going on in Europe when 
you enter the states?  
A: Yeah, I was pretty 
--
 'cause I followed. And of course, all young boys and si nce I was 
a voracious reader I knew I had the battle maps, you know. And I was at Boy Scout 

Camp when the y dropped the bomb on Hiroshi ma. And I remember we stood and 

cheered. You know, and now in retrospect it had to be done but it 's horrific. It's horrific, 

you know. But I had a mil itary attitude. And my grandson now flies the drones i n 

Afghanistan. He's in Las Vegas flying to Afghanistan. And he doesn't talk about it. He 
doesn't talk about it.He's not allowed to. But I know he's doing awful --
because 
-- but i t's 
better that no American pilots are getting kill ed. The airplanes will do the work. And he's 

-- that's his job. And he and I talk -- his father tries to vicariously live his son's life but he 

gravitates t owards me because I'm a combat fl yer. And I flew -- I was in Cambodia and I 

flew a lot of friends in it. And when he talks he talks to me. And we h ave a good 

relationship. Well, I love all my grandsons. It's just fun. I take every one of them when 

they turn 12, I take them out to Bar Mitzvah t rip. And I started with Joe. And the deal is 
you get in the car on a Frida y afternoon and we go somewhere bas
icall y where 
-- the first 
trip where we went on a NFL football weekend to Washington, D.C. We stayed in 
Georgetown and we had a great -- t hat was Joe. And now I have got it pretty well 

refined. Lincoln, I took one of them fl ying. We flew around the Statute of Libert y. 
We 

Interview with Paul Halpern 
 
38 
went to the battleship i n New York. The Aircraft Carrier Intrepid. But the y get i n the car 
and I say to them, "This is what we are going t o do. This is your party. Anything you 

want to sa y to me you can sa y and whatever you sa y in t his car, sta ys in this car. And it 's 

your party. The deal  is you said you would like to do this, if you're tired or you're bored, 
we are out of there. We will find something else to do in the t wo days. And I know your 
father, your mother sa ys'Besure you sa ythan
k you.' I don't want to hear that. If you have 
a good time when I drop you off at home, say 'Thank you.'" And usually in the beginning 
it's like kind of quiet. And then we just chat because I al ways make sure we do some 

driving like that. We drove from Philadelphia t o the Meadowlands to see a football game. 

I went to the Cooper's Town Hall of Fame. We went to see Bost on R ed Sox play in 

Boston. And it 's two days. And I had 
--
 I've got a 15 year old. He got in t he car at twelve 
and a half. He says 
--
 
I said,
 "You kind of know what's, you know, what to expect." He 
said, "Yeah." I said, "You can sa y anyt hing you want."And he sai d, "Can I say t his?" 

And he sai d a four letter word. I said, "Sure." He said, "How about this?" He did about 

six words. I said, "Very i mpressi ve."  

Q: Challenging. 

A: Yeah. Very i mpressive. I said, "So what else do you want to talk about?" You know, 

so he got out of it. And he's get ting -- he had his headset and he's listening to music crap. 
Wit hin an hour he's got the headset off and we're having a good, we are having a -- 
because my wife used t o sa y it's amazi ng m y boy -- m y grandsons love me and until the y 

go on that last trip. After that last trip t hey are yours. That's really funny. We will sit 

somewhere and the y will sit shoulder -- on m y shoulders. You know, we sit in the 

Interview with Paul Halpern 
 
39 
living room both boys sit -- I'm not --I'm not Oppa and I'm not Vaggy. (Ph). And I'm not 
Pop Pop. I would kill t he first child that calls me Pop Pop. I hat e that . And then it's -- the y 

call m y grandpa. And we have -- 
oneof themcalled m y grampsand that's m y inventor 

and he does that just to irritate me. And he also when I started getti ng bold he was also 
the one that  does this t o me. But other than that I've got a good life, you know, I have 
been -- I enjoy what I do. And I know a lot of people just because I -- 
I don't 
-- I have 
been having an interesting time here. And I went to this seminar on can we do a plan 

from the next possible Kindertransport? Is it possible to come up with a plan. And of 

course, the argument was in this modern da y and age if it's a disaster l ike -- she started to 

talk about Katrina. I said we can do Katrina, the world can save Katrina because we 
have the airplanes. And we have the equipment. And we can go down to Haiti. I di d the 
Haiti. I was in McGuire as retired and I hel ped with the Haitian Airli ft. I helped the 
refugee thing because that's what I do. And I said but the Kindertransports, Rwanda 

needed a Ki ndertransporter but because the y were black it  was messy. And so the final 

thing she said was we have to sum this up. I said, "You know, t he next time you need a 

Kindertransport for a specific group, put t hem in a mine in Chile where within 69 da ys 

everybody will be rescued and there will be no political stuff because that's what the 

world does best. I mean this thing with t he miners. So let's put the problem into a mine in 
Chili and the worl d will solve it. Otherwi se, Rwanda is still not solved. You know, 
Kosovo, Sarajevo; not solved. They are sti ll finding bodi es. 

Q: Haitian.  

Interview with Paul Halpern 
 
40 
A: Yeah, it 's horrific. Those are the problems t hat will not be solved 
--
 because people 
didn't l ike each other. But everybody likes a good story and those miners were a good 
story and the world did their thing perfectly. I mean there was no flag because the y all 

flew the Chilean flag and they made sure but it was done correctly. And that's -- if we 
could solve the world's problems, if we can put the problems in a mine in Chili. And 
that's the wa y I feel. You know, I kind of came to -- I was listening to this conversation 
on a -- I don't particularl y like a lot of the -- a lot of the Austrian Jews have quite a bit of 

them because we di dn't  get reparations for a long ti me.  The y treated us like idi ots.  

So this lady from the Austrian deligation, t he gentleman from Germany was fantastic. 

You could ask him a question and he would t hink about it. And you know, "Yeah, we 

were wrong."You know, you are, you know, fourth generati on. She said she st arted to 
talk about all of the wonderful things that the Australian government, all of these 
programs for the poor benefited Jews of Israel -- of Austria. And she went on and on and 

on. And somebody said to her, "How many Jews are left in Austri a? How many Jews?" 

She said, "Well, I coul d kind of go with 3,000. "We are up to 15,000 but there are not the 

15,000, the Austrian Jews, the upper middle class society that held wi th the culture of 

Vienna. It's Russian, Ukrainian, you know, Polish. And people hardworking labors 

basically. It 's one step down. And she sai d, "15,000." And I was texting Shelly. And I 
said, "This lady from Austria just tells me the y have 15,000 --" she sai d, there are 15,000 
Jews left in Austria. She listed enough programs that every Jew could have one special 
project because she kept talking about all  of these people. There i s onl y 15,000. The y 

couldn't do all of these things. This is all people wanting t o play t his "Give game," you 

Interview with Paul Halpern 
 
41 
know.  And it's wrong. It's wrong. And I'm not -- I'm not a fan of the Austrians. I don't 
mind the Germans. I enjoyed, you know, at least you can, you know, that's the past. 
Austria is still in t his to this da y. I know t hat. I know that. And the Austrian -- 
I mean 

here, you know, a lot of the people here from here from the Holocaust do not li ke their 
home county and will not visit or visit and are very uncomfortable. 
Q: When di d you visit for the first time after t he war? After the Holocaust? When was it?  

A: 1968 when I took -- the first ti me I went  back to Austria was when I took the band, the 

Glen Miller band to Grats and Mi mins and the military. And then I vi sited again with m y 

wife and kids again in '68. And then just last November I was in Vienna in 2009 with my 

grandson.  

Q: And your grandparents went? 
A: My grandfather died young, he died when I was 14. So he died in 1946. 
 Q: And he died 
in the States?
 
A: Yeah. He -- well, I told you he came and he said, "I'm goi ng to t he United St ates," and 

he pla yed the game. And my grandmother lived to be 96. And marvelous woman. 

Marvelous woman.
 And the family the y put her into a nursing home in Queens but a real 
nice one. I used to visit her.And she she woul d be 
--
 she was 90. I would say, "Why don't  
you go?" Those are old people. I don't go with old people." And she was the oldest 
person there. And so at that ti me her son, my uncle Walter whom I love dearly, bought 
her a television set. And I understand every m orning she read the large print editi on of 
the New York Times. I mean that 's how good she was. And she watched television. She 

watched sports and cart oons not because it  moved. You know, when you get to be 90 

Interview with Paul Halpern 
 
42 
years old and you're bored and your language, that's not your primary language, sports is 
easy to watch and cartoons. So m y uncle Walter tells a story that it was the finals of the 

NCAA Basketball Tournament bet ween Michigan State and Magic Johnson. These are 

people that you don't know but these are great  athletes.And nine out the ten pl ayers on 
the floor were black.And the y are all big and the y were running up and down in the 

sports shorts. And m y grandmot her is, he's kind of watching the game, you know, a little 
bit. And she says t o him, "Walter, what are they doing?" He said, "They are pla ying 

basketball Mom." And she said, "Oh." She wat ched for a while and she said, "Which are 

the Jewish boys?" And they were ni ne, six foot , inch when the y are going for that. You 

know, but that's a fond memory. That's a fond memory. She was a wonderful woman. 

Wonderful woman. I like, I dearly loved her. She loved us which was the interesting 
thing. And I have no idea where she spawned a spoiled brat of a child that was m y 
mother. And who 
--
 at 90 was a spoiled brat. She was entertaining and she, you know, 
and like I said, I told you I thought Betty Whi te would play her i n the movie. Bill Burke 

would have pla yed her in the movie. That's before your ti me. Tha
twas my mom.
 And 
but my kids loved her because grandma was synonymous with presents. My wife on the 

other hand ran m y kids a little bit better. My daughter had Aaron who was very bri ght 

and he was two years 
--
 coming up on two. And she would say dada and she wouldn't sa y 
momma. And she said, "You know, mom --" she m y wife baby-sat  for her one da y 

because she was doing some work and her sitt er was out. And she sai d, "You know, that 

kind of hurts." She sa ys -- they work for us. Her husband worked for us. She sa ys, "He 

will sa ys daddy. He won't say momma." So she went away. She came back about four 

Interview with Paul Halpern 
 
43 
hours later. And Betty said to Aaron, "Who is that?" And Aaron said, "Momma." And 
she said, "Who am I?" She said, "Momma." And she said, "How did you do that?" She 

said, "Real ly si mple.We had lunch and I sai d, 'Do you want dessert?' She said, 'Yes.' I 

said to hi m, if you want dessert say momma.'" He said momma. And later on she said, 
"Do you want some candy?What, do you sa y? " "Momma." So within 30 minutes she 
taught them how t o sa y a word that my daught er had been working on for months. 
But that 's the difference between my wife and my mother, you know. My mother would 

be the person that woul d talk about herself for hours and at the end of it, she would sa y, 

"Well, that 's enough about me. Let 's tal k about  you. What do you think of me." I mean 

that was the attitude that she had. And it was charming but at the same ti me after a while, 

you know, it's, it's up here. And it's not, it 's not deep. But I was five when I left. I was in 
six -- well, five when she left me, you know, t o go to prison. And I was alwa ys taken 
care of by nannies and so on. So m y bonding with m y mother was never really a bond. 

And it was her problem; not mine. When we came back to the Uni ted States she was busy 

-- the y were trying t o make a living. My dad came back. But the mi nute the y came back 

into the situation where the y -- where the y could do well, it became her story agai n and 

not mine. You got  to remember she went back in 1940 -- 1950, she went back to Austria 

to spend si x mont hs out the year. I was 17, she left. I was a freshman in college and she 
left. I got to be an anchor -- you know, at Ohio State. She could do that and never l ook 

back.  And never look back on it. And there was no nanny for me. And I was a hard 

case. I mean I was -- I know what  I wanted which I had no idea what was it but I knew 

what I wanted that's why, "He's a big boy." 

Interview with Paul Halpern

Q: What di d your dad do when he came to the States?  
A: Well, first thing he did was he looked for work. And he came up with this idea of the 

pit man shortage was starting.  And in Europe women carry net shopping bag, you know, 

fishnet shopping. And so like I said, he got my mother's friends who are all wonderful 
because the y were all society women. They could all do embroidering and the y could do 
this stitch. And the y stitched these handles. Beautiful colors. They got  the most colorful 

rolls to do that and he i mmediately started selling them. He took two dozen to 

Bloomingdale's and they ordered 100 dozen the first day he was there. Now he's got to 

get woman in line t o do this. And then he did this and he did that . And then he became 

politely put it he became a facilitator. He went into the i mport/export business. During 

the War and after the War he was friends wit h -- he made friends with a guy named Sam 
Spig -- Sam Spiggel. And the y had their European contacts and so on. And whenever 
something was needed, the y understood how to get it legally. Not illegally. Legally the y 
knew where to get t hings. The y would -- 
th
e need 
-- like m y dad i nvented these shopping 
bags for Americans but  knowing i t from Europe. They had a pretty good business 

together. And then Sam's son came out of the military. And he was a radar operator, you 
know radar was new and television had just started, you know. The World Series in 1939. 

There was and the first television was shown at the World's Fair. And the son came to us 
there and he said, "Television is t he future." I know how to buil d -- you know, at that 
time you could buy a kit to make a televisi on set with tubes and the whole bit. The y are 

going to be hundreds of television stations around the country and they need monitors. 

The y will need the monitor. It's nothing but a television set for one station basically is 

Interview with Paul Halpern 
 
45 
what.  I want to build perfectl y, correctly done. I'll buy the kits. I want to build them and 
sell them t o television stations as their monitors. And Sam came t o my father and he said, 
"I want to get into this." My father, you know, he was mechanically was a disaster.He 
said, "If it will make us a buck," and the y did very well. The y made t he first monitors for 
CBS New York and WOR and Dumont station. The y had a good business. The y had 
about four or five of these guys who were reall y good at it. There was tubes and solder 
and wire and the y would pinch them until the y were correct. And then the y would deliver 

them and they got good mone y for them. You know, we had the first 12 inch television 

set. I watched the 1947 World Seri es in m y house on a 12 inch TV set  which was big, bi g 

TV set. And you know the memory of Europe after the war, a lot of Europeans came to 

the United States. Took out their first papers, hung around for three months and went 
back to Europe, you know, because the establi shed residence and t hen went back. A lot 
of m y mot her's friends did that. And they kind of hang out at m y house a lot of times, you 
know.  I mean they lived in small quarters. There weren't that  welcome because nobody 
had a lot of -- the wealt hy people didn't have a lot of mone y but t he y came to the United 

States so t he y would have the protection in the next war. The y would sit in m y l iving 

room watching televisi on which was primitive. Eating good food and have gained, 

everyone gained 10, 15 pounds, and talk about  how stupid Americans were.  And I 
couldn't stand i t. And I was 12, 13. I couldn't stay in the same room with them because it 
was impoli te to me. It was impoli te to be rude to your guests. But I hate -- don't talk 

about m y country l ike t hat because I'm an American. As far as I know, I'm going t o be an 

America. And m y dad t he same way. My dad was not happy wit h that. But they would sit 

Interview with Paul Halpern 
 
46 
and eat. The y eat really good food. You know, the y woul d and then talk down the 
country that  the y were getting first papers from. My mother said, you know, "The y're just 

protecting t hemselves." No, you're not. You need manners. You are going to do that at 

least if you're a hypocri te be a hypocrite wit h manners.Don't be a hypocrite with no 
manners. And so you know, we di dn't agree on a lot of things but nobody talk
ed. I mean 

you weren't allowed. You didn't talk against t hem. 

Q: Did your mom tell you something about bei ng in prison or dad. 

A: A little bit. My dad not a lot. Because he was -- I can't remember. My father came out 

of Polish country stock. And so he was 
a self
-educated man. He was never very 
comfortable. My father never spoke to m y mot her, m y grandmother in familiar. He never 

said Due. As a matt er of fact if he said somethi ng, you speak German? He would say to 
m y mother through m ygrandmother's(Speaki ng 
German.) "Would t he dear mot her like a 
cup of coffee?" He always called her (German). De or Due. Always spoke because he 
was -- her husband had been his boss. You know, and he was like -- m y mother's family 

treated m y dad like t he hired hand. He went back and he build that business. And by the 

time the business sold t hey had, he had a lot of money had come back, had filtered 

through Switzerland legally. And the y -- t here's still mone y i n Swit zerland from 1968, 

'78. Sti ll mone y accrui ng legally. 
Absolutely legally but he managed mone y correctly 
and did -- and he was t heir hired hand. And my mother let them do that. But you know, 

he was so much ol der t han I was. I didn't have that kind of -- I didn't have that much 

respect for hem. But as I got older I liked h
i m moreand more.
We really can get into 
conversations and we li ked each other. My dad was a good chess pla yer. And he would 

Interview with Paul Halpern 
 
47 
beat my brains out. He never insulted me. It was always, "Let's pl ay another one." "Oh, 
you want to play another one. Oh, yeah." And I first time I beat hi m and I was so proud 

of m yself. And so m y kids, you want to pla y -- I'm not a good chess player but I'm better 

than m y ki ds. But  you want to beat  me, I mean you want  to pla y me chess. You want to 
beat me. I'm not  throwi ng the game. You want  to pla y Gi n Rumm y with me. If you are 
stupid, you're going to lose. And you know, and you know, it 's not --  I'm not -- 
if you 

play with me level, I'll treat you wi th respect and respect i s pla y. And I'll pla y with you 

and when you beat me, I would sa y, "Do you want to play?" And m y genius grandson 

can beat me to death. And pla ys three di mensional chess. He plays this three level chess. 

He says, "I'm not very good at it." I mean, "You can't pla y?" "Oh, I understand the game. 

I'm just  not a good chess pla yer." He beats m y brains out . So we don't pla y any l onger. 
But that 's -- it was a different, different kind of a family. You know, we didn't have many 
Jewish ties. And ma ybe I regretted. That's why I kind of like Shelly. Like I said, one 

day I said t o m y son, I said, "Where you going tonight?" I said, "I'm going to Black 

Wood to be with Shelly. To Lakewood." He said, "What are you going to do today?" 

"We're going to the show." And he sai d, "Dad, you hear that sound?" I sai d, "What i s 
that?" "That's my mot her spinning in her grave." You know, because that wasn't wasn't 

me. I enjoy it, you know. You know, because I got nothing to do right now. I'm enjoyi ng 
m y life. You know I go to bed when I want  to. I'm kind of regretting having to gi ve up 
this bachelor pad I've got now. Because not like, I'm a cook and there are some ol der 

people living above me but the y see me travel with a suitcase and Camo bag and 

Interview with Paul Halpern 
 
48 
they know I'm a graphic designer and they know I'm a photographer. And the y know -- 
people the y know t hat I sit out there and I smoke. I'm back to smoking one cigar a da y. 

And I sit out by the pool and I put on a headset. Here's a 77-
year
-old man with a headset  
on and a hoody wit h the Air Force Academ y on it smoking a cigar and listening to -- the y 
have no idea what I'm l istening to.If I told them what I listen to. I listen to Doo-wop 
music or I l isten to Mozart. And I just -- and the little Oriental kids come and pla y with 

me. And I sa y "Mehow." (Ph). And the y sa y "Mehow."You know, I'm kind of like the y 
have no idea how old I am.The y have no idea how old I am. I don't feel like I'm old, 

you know, I mean you have some people here and some of them are 
--
 I'm very -- for a 
while I was solid, but you know then I got m y life back. For the last year I got my life 

back.  And it's a new adventure because I can show 
--
 I can -- she is shari ng Judaism, you 
know, she's been an Orthodox Jew. She is more of a m ysti c. She believes people have 

auras and people are t his and people are that. But she's -- she is way more Jewish than I 

am. And I'm enjoying myself. I'm enjoying myself. I'm never 
--
 I'm not happy with God. 
I'm not happy with God. I mean we work hard. My wife and I worked hard.And two 
months after we reti re we was goi ng to have a great ti me t ogether because we got  all the 

money in t he world we need. We are going to do this. The kids are all very well off. And 

we were going to have a good ti me and she strokes out on me for seven years. That's 
selfish what I just said. She just st roked out on me. She stroked out. And I would have 
done this for the next 30 years. I would have 
--
 as she got  more infirm 
--
 and the y said, 
"Dad, you have all of this insurance. You need to have somebody in 24/7." I said, 

"Nobody sleeps with your mother but me." You know, I don't care if she gets up in the 

Interview with Paul Halpern 
 
49 
middle of the night . I will take you to the bathroom and I'm not embarrassed about it. But 
you know, your mother and I had been together for some long but  I would feel wrong. 

And m y wife -- your mother woul d feel wrong having to be helped to the bathroom by an 

aide while I'm i n the room. That's different. I would rather do it myself. And I tell you m y 
daughter tol d me this ma ybe two months ago. The last year every Saturda y she would sa y 
-- m y daughter would say 
--
 m y wife woul d say, "I want to talk to my daughter." I dial 
the phone. I would sa y or Susan would cal l. I would go do m y Camo work for something 

else. I would go out wit h the board. And the y t alked for what an hour and half. And she 

said, "Paul, I have to go to the bathroom." She would sa y, "I wi ll call you back." I get her 

a cup of coffee or something to eat  and she go back to the phone. And Susan sai d that for 

the last year every ti me she said goodbye she would sa y, "Remember. Do not let hi m 
vegetate." That's a good woman. And which is a blessing, you know. Originally I said, 
you know, it's not very long. "Dad, you're i mpossible. You know, you're grumpy. 

Your outlook on l ife is wrong. You know, the kids -- you're affecting the kids. You're 

not, you know, you're not who you normally are." And so basically she said, "Mom 

wouldn't want do you do that. Mom wouldn't want you t o do that." And this woman 

understands. I mean she -- when we did -- l ike November 18th is, 19t h is -- is was  

28th.  I would like -- but we will go to the cemetery the three of us. The four of us 
depending on if Jack can come from Richmond. We go to the cemetery. We will go to her 
favorite restaurant and we will order a vodka and Absolute and 7-Up and we will  put it in 

the middle of the table and we will  have lunch and we will leave the glass there when we 

go home. It 's j ust, you know, it's something t o do because we were friends. And it has 

Interview with Paul Halpern 
 
50 
nothing to do wit h Jewi sh tradition. I mean I do not like m y religi on right now. I don't 
like -- what kind of God let this go on like this? I went back to m y senior community for 

the holidays. And I didn't, I did-- I did Rosh Hashana but I fasted and I did Yom Kippur 

with my friends because out of respect. I think, I think that she needs to be remembered. 
She needs t o be remembered for everything. And I never going to -- she is buried in a 
mil itary cemetery about 20 miles from where I live and six miles from the base. And I 

work at the McGuire Airforce Base one da y a week at the t erminal helping people, space 

available in the families. And I can go two mil es out of m y wa y and t ake a different road 

to the base. And I visit my wife twice a month for ten minutes. It 's just -- I go out  there. I 

remember one day I was at McGui re. I was goi ng to go afterwards because it was 

summer. It was late. And the base closed up because there were light ing storms in the 
area and the y said, "We're going to cancel all operations." So the weather was st ill clear 
and I said, "I'm going t o go out to the cemetery now." And I was standing there and I 

don't know if you have seen military cemeteries, the y are flat.All of headstones, you 

know, how thousands are buried there. And I'm standing there and about 150 feet awa y 

was this li ghting bolt came down and hit in the middle of the woods and I began to ran. I 

mean the thunder and li ghting hit together so it  was right where I was. I was standing out 

there among metal planks so I started to run for the car. And the car is 150 feet wa y and I 
am like a wet rag. And it's raining and the lighting i s hitting and I rolled the window 
down and I said, "That's not funny. You got me." But it 's just, you know, it's not -- 
you 
don't have to -- one of the greatest -- there's a man. His wife died in December. And 

every ti me I was there, he would spend four days a week i n a chair and he had a hamper 

Interview with Paul Halpern 
 
51 
for food and he would sit for six hours a da y and go have lunch and go back. He had a 
picture of his wife and he set it up in the at tic. And he sat up and t hat's not necessary. 

You know, we can tell stories about my wife forever and t he kids understand that. I 

mean, you know. And they have a totally different idea of who she is because she is the 
tough one. You know, I went to Vietnam she ran the house. And she got into it with my 
14-
year
-old son about he wanted a motor scooter. And he wrote me a letter. And the letter 
said, "Dear Dad, your wife is driving m y crazy." That 's beauty, isn't i t? "Your wife is 

driving me craz y." I wrote her back a letter. I said, "Join the crowd. Take a number. Live 

with it." You know, what else was there. But I have a good relationshi p with the kids. 

You know, you talked about German. You tal k about working for Germans.My daughter 
worked -- she was IT for Siemens for 17 years. She was head of IT from big money. And 
then when she got divorced she wanted to stick close to t he home and now she works IT 
for a buyer and she works from home and she is an absolute killer. She's a mother. She's 

just as much as my mot her as her mom. And m y ol dest son is vice president  of NCR 
corporation and he runs the automated checkout division. And he is a combination.He's 

me. He's a little guy. Five foot six and his son is five foot four. He's a little guy but you 

don't want to call hi m a little guy. I mean he's vice president NC R and he's really tough. 

He owns a vineyard and we go out and we pick by hands for 10 years. I just finished for 
helping. And the t hird one is a Cornell graduate and he's largest caterer in Virginia. Right 
now business is not great. Nobody has any money. When Betty di ed, we had sol d the 

house and we took the mone y to buy this apart ment in thi s Federation, CCRC, or most  of 

it and I got lucky because when I die -- when she died and I moved out I got 90 percent 

Interview with Paul Halpern 
 
52 
of m y money back. That the y had a year to pay me but t he y sold my apartment within 
two months. So I took 200,00 some odd thousand dollars. And I said, "This is not my 

money. This is not my money." And I set  up education funds for the remaining 

grandchildren that hadn't been -- and I gave mone y to t he guys who had graduated. Not a 
lot of money but I got nine of these guys that I spent -- I gave $200,000 awa y. Well, and 
what about mothers. As I started taking care of m y mother I would drive up there twice a 

month and I woul d pa y the help and I would do the shopping for her. And you know, and 

she said to me, 
"I have toredo m y will."
 I said, "Oka y." And she said, now the problem 
is you know Liz i s on welfare, you know, and on Social Security. And the y tell me that 

she's not going to -- that that might affect the will." I said, "You're damn right. Any 

mon e y yo
u leave her the State of New York will take for welfare. You have to pay 
back the state before she gets the mone y." "Well, that's not fair." I sai d -- she sai d, "Well , 

then we have -- I want to give mone y to m y grandchildren. She has t wo daughters and 

you 
have three children." I said, "Mom, just skip the generation."  "Well, I can't do 

that." I sai d, "I don't need your mone y. I don't have the mone y but  I don't need your 

money. I already runni ng your business anyhow. You got mone y. I'm representing 

you in all t he family affairs and I don't get paid for it. Skip a generati on." "Oh, that can't 

be done." My idiot uncle who is an engineer says, "Oh, you can't do that." I said, "Talk 
to your attorne y." So the y get an attorne y. The y get a $3,000 bill  that sa y, yeah, of 
course you can do t hat. The guy thought about  it for nine minutes. They said, "He doesn't 
know what  he's talking about." They get another attorne y and the y spend $4,000. Sa ys, 

"Yeah, of course you can do that.  I'll write the will." So now the will gets -- and the  

Interview with Paul Halpern 
 
53 
deal is skip a generation, the mone y gets split between the five grandchildren. And 
among them -- among not between. And I'm t he executor which i s legal. I get a call from 

m y uncle. He says, "That's an unfair will." "What are you talking about?" He said, "You 

know, it was 50/50. Your three chil dren were going to split 50 percent of grandma's 
money. My mother's money. And your sister's kids were going to get -- now they would 
have gotten 25 percent each. Now t he y are really getting 20 percent and your chi ldren 

should have gotten 60 now the y are getting 20.  That's not fair." And I said a verb and 

pronoun you know what I mean. And I said, "You know, 25 percent of nothing is 

nothing. 20 percent  of million pl us is something." And each one of the kids got  al most 

$300,000 by the ti me I finished, you know, over the years and I distributed it. And so I 

feel very good about that. And I don't mi nd, you know, it was better for them. I mean 
the y were able to use it . And Mike bought a vi neyard and Susan bought a house, and you 
know, everybody did well. And but that's the fami ly this, this spoiled bunch of -- 
my 

grandfather and m y grandmother were really sharp but the y raised three of the most 

spoiled brat s in the history of the world, you know. I love my uncle 
because he was a 

mechanical engineer genius and he died just t wo years ago. Great. He was a good man.  

We were friends. But as far as -- I said to hi m, "Are you going t o go for the Holocaust 

money?" And he said, "I'm not a Hol ocaust survivor." I said, "Walter, where were you in 
1939?" He said, "I was a student at RPI."I said, "Where were you living?" He said, "I 
was a student living in United States going to Polytech." I said, "Were you able t o get 

back?"He said, "Oh, no. I couldn't get back." I said, "Guess what, you were a refugee." 

"Oh, you think so. Wel l, I don't need t he money." I said, "Oka y. Let me fill it out for 

Interview with Paul Halpern 
 
54 
you. You know, fill out the information. I'll ask you questions and we will submit  it." 
And he sai d, "If you get me money, you can have it." Then a year later I call ed him up 

and Isaid, "Where's my check?"
 He said, "What check?" I said, "You got a check for 
$26,000 and you t old me I could have it." "Well, I will  buy you di nner." And I said, "I'm 
going to find a place where dinner i s $26,00
0 because youown me mone y."
No -- well 
no. I said, "Don't worry about it." So the next sequence came and the y didn't fill it out 
again.  This ti me t he y lost  a lot of mone y because now the y start ed -- here's an interesti ng, 

the last preparations came in, yo
u know 
--  and you know, we had the apart ment and the 
world but I remember m y father sold the fami l y business so the y couldn't have that many 

assets left because t he y had been paid -- the mone y had been come out of in 60s. So I 

got my final and the y said, you know, it 's so many -- you people live so -- basically it 's 
you people life so damn long. There is so many of you remaining, we don't have a lot  -- 
we can only pa y ten cents on the dollar. Here's what you're worth and we're going to pay 

you a three-fifth. So remember your sister get s, your sister's family gets one half of the 

estate but since the y di dn't apply for it nobody gets it unless you're willing, you know, 

unless you're willing t o let them get paid t hrough you and you will agree to pa y them 

which I did. And the y left a lot of money on the table. Now you are going to get -- 
you 
are going to get documents that I'm get ting you. And among the documents I found this 
list because I'm pretty good about  the computer and the internet. And there was a listing. 
And here was my father and there were open insurance policies. I said that can't be my 

father; he didn't believe in insurance. But I wrote them a let ter. And it was a Italian 

company, depart ment. And I said, "My dad di ed. Here's the death certificate. M
y mother 

Interview with Paul Halpern 
 
55 
died.  Here's her death certificate. My sister died, here's her death certificate. I have no 
idea what this is but the birthda y is correct and asked peck (ph) is correct. Do I have any 
money coming?" About a month l ater I get thi s package and it looked like it been went 

through a washing machine. And t here is stamps all over i t; Italian stamps. And it's from 
them and it's a package. And the y said, "Yes. You are -- thank you very much. We have 

certified that you're the sole beneficiary because of the fact that we have the death 

certificate. Your father took out a $2,000 -- now he took out a $200 annuity for 20 years 

would have have paid in '49. And the Nazi part y cashed it in in '39. Therefore since that 's 

an invalid cash in, it would have been 4,200 some odd dollars. Since it's an i nvalid cash 

in, we are going to pa y as if you had never done it, we would like to know where to sent 

$137,000. And I read it  again. And I said, "We're going to buy a nice car, Betty." You 
know because the best revenge is living well. You know, and I got -- so my bank that I 
used to print for calls me up and sa ys, "Mr. Halpern we just got  a deposit into your 

account." I said, "Really." The y said, "Yeah. You want to leave it in your checking 

account?" I said, "Five figures?" They said, "No, it's six figures." I said, "Oka y. I'll be 

down there.  We are going to deal with it but just put it over into a mone y market 
account until I get t here." But that was, you know, and that was m y dad and he had done 

that for one reason: 
Because 
m y grandfather believed in insurance. Now I will  tell you 
if m y father had a $200 account, m y grandfather's account was in those papers. His name 

was listed too. They never followed up on it. Now if m y father had $200, you know how 

much  
-- m y grandfather had a policy with Anchor. Anchor was a British company 

Uncore I thi nk but the y paid too. If my grandfather had 
--
 if m y father had $200, then 

Interview with Paul Halpern 
 
56 
m y grandfather must have had $2,000. Because m y grandfather -- my father would never 
have bought that polic y if my grandfather hadn't said i t was a good idea. 

Q: Now speaking about family funds, I would like to get back to t he incident you 

described in the rest aurant where your dad was speaking with man who he recognize. Do 
you know who those people were who were li ving in your apartment ? 
A: Nope.  

Q: What happened t o your apartment like Œ  
A: Well, the buildi ng got bombed out. 

Q: It's a different building now?  

A: It's completely -- it's a totally different buil ding now. It was t he corner building onto to 

where you step
ped out. But no that's 
--
 I don't know what happened. It's just  a great story 
because my father, m y father was that kind of a man. Quick one on my father that that I 

heardfrom my mot her andshe 
-- her attitude was different. Where m y mother went in 
1950 the first ti me she was went -- she was going to come live with him in Germany and 

you got the Ponseon and the y always travel ed by the Queen Elizabeth and the y pl a yed 

bridge all t he way across the ocean and back. And you had stop in Paris to get a gra y card 

so you can go behi nd the Iron Curtain. And at that ti me the Cold War was going on. 
And m y father said to m y mother, "We're going to get on this train. And we have a 
compart ment, you know, semi-private compartment. And the R ussians are going to come 
on board and they are going to ask you. You don't say a word. Not a word. I'll talk to 

them." You got to remember he's really mild mannered. He sa ys, "You can't say 

anyt hing." And you know, if you know that the Russians occupied Austria with their

Mongrel troops. Vienna was occupied by the Mongrels because the Russians knew that if 
they sent their sophisticated troops in possessi on was unbelievably high so the y sent in 

the guys that slaughtered chickens -- I mean they really were the murders. You're a 

Russian but you understand what I'm sa ying? 
Q: Yeah, I know about Mongrels. 
A: The Mongrels troops were the ones that they sent and they were tough. So m y mom 

and dad, the train st arts and it gets to the border.And into t heir compartment come two 

Soviet soldiers. And 
my dad 
-- and the y are carrying Stems over their shoulder. And he 
says 
-- when the soldier sa ys to m y father, "Passport." International world. My father 

takes out these two -- i n those da ys the Ameri can passport was green with this enormous 

eagle on it. The American eagle. And this guy looks at hi m and he says, "Americanee." 
And m y father says -- and he takes the passport and he opens it and he does this, you 
know, next  to his face. And then he goes t o my mother and she flinches and does that 

next to her f ace. He closes it and he hands it to m y father and he hands it to m y father and 

he leans over m y father and he spits between m y father's legs.(Noise.) He hands him the 

passport and father sa ys, "Thank you." 

Q: What year was this?  

A: '60, '61. And he says -- no, no. Excuse me, '50, '51. Excuse me, but this '50 or '51. 
Because m y mother went in '50. So it  had to be '50. And he -- m y fat her says, "Thank 
you."
 And this Russian looks at hi m and he sa ys, "Sacebo". (Ph). My father says, "Thank 

you."
 He sa ys, "You sir, Sacebo."My father said, "I am an American. Thank you." And 

the guy took the st en off. Never pointed it at him. Took the sten off his helmet and said, 

Interview with Paul Halpern 
 
58 
"Sacebo." And just then an officer comes t o the door and he sa ys in Russian, "What the 
hell is goi ng on?" We got all this 
--
 you guys are wasting ti me here."My father leans 
around this soldier and in perfect Russian sa ys to hi m, "This expletive deleted, expletive 

deleted is tryi ng to teach me a language that  was m y mot her tongue before he was just an 
idea in his father's mind." You know, really course. And he said, "He wants me to speak 
a language t hat I knew. I will not. I am an American. I will speak m y language. The 

language of, of the country." And he said -- and he sat there. And the soldier is still 

holding the passports. The officer went over and he took the passport s out he sai d 

something. The y left the compart ment. And the officer walked up to m y father, handed 

hi m the passport and said, "Thank you." Which is a great story. You know, but m y 
mot
her said, "You father's insane. Your father is insane. He could have gotten me killed." 
That's m y mot her. And I said, "No, if you had died you would have di ed a hero," because 

that's magnificent. That  was my dad. You know, I mean he was a real  quiet man and I 

wish I had known hi m better. And to tell you t he truth when I go up t o the family plot, I 

talk to my father. The y're buried in Mont Hepburn in Fleshing, New York. I go up there 

once a year. But that 's 
--
 so money wise I don't  know. I do not know what happened. I 
know the apartment was demolished. I know t hat went to visit the factory in 

Gupendolfush Dausen (ph). On our wa y out back to Vienna we st opped. It's in the Fifth 
District. And I went -- I vaguely remember that you had t o open -- it was a bunch o
f 
buildings on a narrow street but you had to open a gate. There was a courtyard for the 

factory. And it's still there but it's a music studio and graphic desi gn. Once again t here we 

go again. But I -- I don't feel any smertz for loss because I'm an American. I mean I 

Interview with Paul Halpern 
 
59 
came so early. I love baseball. I pla yed coll ege soccer but I played. I'm an American. 
I'm sportswriter. I can be couth, uncouth. You know, but I am, I like who I am. I'm -- not 
everybody likes me but I am who I am. 

Q: Did you speak German in 
yourfamily or English?
 
A: No, we -- well my mother wanted to speak to m y father, they knew the German we 

understood it.We didn't speak German at home.  But the y were would talk French. No 
m y father -- 
typically my mother.
 My mother spoke a lot of languages. My father speaks 
about twelve.From busi ness he spoke Czech, Croatia, Sl ovenian, Russian, Hebrew. But 
mother would speak in a language in which he was uncomfortable -- he was not 

comfortable in French. He could speak it.But he was like a student. 
My 
mother spoke 
perfect French because she learned it. You know, but pretty soon we caught on. 
And m y si ster and I both took French from, you know, we knew what  they were talking 
about.  Then the y switched to Czech a littl e bit. But no, no, but my mot her, of course, 

spoke German with her friends. And I just wanted to sl ap her silly. Because come on, 

mom, everybody speaks English. I know you speak English. I know she speaks English 

because I speak English to her. And she i s just -- she was just a l ittle bit different. But 

yeah, we can't speak -- like I sa y, my vocabulary came out of nowhere. Like I said, what 

five-
year
-old child knows the word was asqaci tnine (ph). You know, and I woul d pick up 
expressions from my m other. She called del icatessen the Malour (ph) shop because it's, 

you know, I use that expression. I guess I learned some t hings from my mother. Snobbish 

things. But no, she would do life totally -- t o somebody who spent two years in the prison 

Interview with Paul Halpern 
 
60 
when from the Nazi s to be totally unaffected. Literally unaffected by it. Ask me who her 
favorite composer i s? Wagner. 

Q: Did she know about Wagner bei ng -- 

A: Of course. My mother went -- the y live i n Forest Hills. When m y dad died her friends 
wouldn't come play bridge on the subwa y so she moved to Lincol n -- to one Lincoln 
Center so she could walk and alwa ys had one t icket available. She used to go three or 

four times a week to the opera. The y would hold the ticket at the box office. And they 

always had one ticket for her.  And she would sit through the enti re --  she would sit 

through every single one of these one of those and the y would do thi s marathon. The y 

would do t hem like in five nights and my mother would go every night. And it's like 

eating a mattress. It's good God. There some nice but  it's really heavy
, heavy, heavy 
heart.   So she bought this membership. And she always got five tickets for two for five. 

She alwa ys had a ti cket. She woul d get five operas and she would also be able to pick 

three good ones and always Wagner. And it alwa ys give you -- l ike you know when you 

buy basebal l seats, you get the teams you don't want to see but you have to buy t hat 

ticket.  And she said to us, "I have these tickets to the Opera. Why don't you come and 
have dinner and then you can go t o the opera because I have these very nice seats."I said, 
"That's nice of you, mom." 
Ilikeopera but my wife 
-- Cleveland, Ohio. And she said -- I 
said, "What's t he opera?" She said, "Hazel and Gretel."And I said, "Thanks, mom." I 

hope -- "Will there be a translation so I can follow this st ory?" 
Thatwas my mom.
 
Q: Well, we have to int errupt for changing tracks here.

Beginning File Three 
Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memori al Museum Interview 
with Paul Felix Halpern conducted by Jul iet Eninina (ph) on    October 17th of 2010 at 

the Kindertransport Association Conference i n Arlington, Virgi nia.  Let's continue.   
A: It is -- it was -- Levi  Eshkol had just died.  And when we visited t he cemetery, the y 
had just -- i t was the last day of Shiva, and they had opened the grave up for -- you know, 

that people could go by there.  And so that 's the ti ming.  I just figure out a week after 

Levi Eshkol died, t hat's when I was there with m y wife on that trip.  And I loved 

everything, and I felt very -- 
and m y
 wife said, This is the most amazing place in the 
world.  That garbage man over there is a Jew, and that mail man is a Jew, and that guy in 

that barber shop giving a haircut is a Jew.  And, you know -- and they'll talk about t he 
rich Jews, and everybody is a brot her here, and it isn't -- it's -- it's classless.  I mean, there 
are classes but within 
--
 and it -- it makes a lie out of the rich Jew.  And she says, I'm not 
a rich Jew.  I was a poor Russian, you know, and I -- you know, and t hey told me I killed 

Christ, you know.  And -- but she was very -- she loved Israel.  We thought it was -- and 

we walked.  There was no tram.  We walked up on the -- t he -- the Masada.  We walked.  

We walked up there.  And, of course, to me, the military aspect of it is tremendous.  You 

know, that's where the Tank Corps gets sworn in.  And I tried to get 
--
 
give m y military 
guys -- I says, You don't understand.  Never again means never again.  And it 's -- if -- and 

they said, Well, you know, we're not -- we're gonna neglect Israel.  I says, You're out of 

your mind.  Israel goes down, the y will take the rest of the world down with them, 

because never again m eans never again.  They're not going down wi thout a fight.  And if 

Interview with Paul Halpern 
 
62 
the fight is nuclear, they're gonna go nuclear and the worl d will die because of that, so it 
behooves every country i n the world to make sure that Israel conti nues to exist because of 

the fact that these are tough, tough people who are not going down.  Now, I'm not as 

honest.  I --  I believe land for peace, but that's m y opinion.  And I had no right to tell 
them what to do, and I feel very strongly about that.  And what 's interesting is, I -- I had 
the -- like I say, I had t his -- m y father's cousin.  Her name was B etty Rubenstei n (ph) and 

her kids were soverest (ph), and she and her husband came in the thirties through the 

Palestine.  And they were very well-establi shed, and the y had friends in high places.  And 

one of her friends was a woman named Tao Rath (ph) who was t he pearl (ph) muster, the 

social -- unofficial social secretary.  When Bernstein would come to 
--
 he would stay wit h 
Tao.  And we had a lot of time because, in bet ween peace missions, you know, when -- 
the Secret Service would be at the King David Hotel in Jerusalem, and the y'd sa y, 
Henry's going to bed.  You guys are off dut y.  Check in again in t he morning.  Because 

we flew the li mousine back and forth.  And I get a call from this l ady, and she sa ys to me, 

Hi, I'm Betty's -- Betty Rubenstein's friend, Tao Rath.  And I didn't know who that was.  

She said, Do you like music?  I said, I love music.  She sa ys, You know, the Israeli 

Philharmonic is pl a ying tonight.  I said, Yeah, but it's like the -- like t he tickets t o the 

Boston Red Sox.  You have to -- have to know somebody who dies so you can get their 
tickets.  She said, Ooh, would you like to go?  And I said, I woul d love to go.  And she 
said, Do you have a jacket?  And I said, Yes, I have a jacket .  I had a blazer, because we 

flew civilian clothes.  And she said -- and she said, The address i s so and so.  I said, I 

know where it is.  I can get there.  I'll take a cab.  And we were stayi ng downtown -- we 

Interview with Paul Halpern 
 
63 
were sta ying out by the airport, as a matter of fact.  I said, I can get there.  And I'm 
standing there, and she said, Meet me at the musician's entrance.  And this li mousine 

pulls up and this driver gets out and he opens the door and this woman about that big -- 

m y mother's small.  This woman i s that small.  And she gets out, and she is the most 
charming woman i n the world.  And she sa ys, We're running late.  Come in.  She knocks 
on the door, and the door opens up and the guard says, Ah, Mrs. Rafal (ph) Rath, how are 

you?  Hello, Henry.  How are you?  And she shakes his hand, and we walk across the   

stage -- and the orchestra's tuning up.  We wal k across the stage, we walk down into the 

audience and Krivit sky was conducting and playing.  He actually was gonna play.  And 

he's magnificent.  And we walk, and she's shaking hands with people, and she says, 

Where's George?  Oh, George is not here toni ght.  He couldn't make it.  Oka y, t his is m y 
friend Paul.  He's with Dr. Kissinger.  He's gonna sit here.  And I sai d, Where are you 
gonna sit?  She says, Ooh -- and I l ook and she's sitti ng on t he steps with friends.  And 

the first act is -- you know, he -- he's pl a ying, and it's marvel 
--
 he's a real -- he was 
fantastic in typical Russian with -- with t he flowing hair.  And she sa ys, Come buy me a 

drink, you know?  Then she sa ys, Do you have any Israeli mone y?   And I said, Yeah, I 

got shekels, you know?  And we stand there, and people come around her because she    

is -- and because I'm with her, people are tal king to me.  And we -- we finish, and we go 
back to -- back to our seats and we finish t he concert, and she sa ys, Would you li ke to 
meet the maestro?  I said, I'd l ove to.  And we go to the Arturo Toscanini room, which i s 

the VIP lounge, back of the hall, and she walks in and Krivitsky puts down his glass, 

walks across, kisses her hand and sa ys, Tao, my darling, how are you?  And she said -- 

Interview with Paul Halpern 
 
64 
she sa ys, I'm wonderful.  This is my friend, Paul.  He's with Dr. Kissi nger.  And, of 
course, he doesn't shake hands wit h anybody.  His hands are his gold.  And he said, Nice 

to meet you.  I said, Thank you so much, Maestro.  It was marvel ous, you know?  I know 

how to talk.  And he looked at me like Americans that do that, and he said, You're 
welcome.  And that  was the first time.  So we went to see two concert s.  One was with 
the American -- the one that conducted the Washington National , the black who was 

paralyzed, and he was marvelous, too.  One day she says, Are you free for dinner 

tomorrow?  And I said, I'll call you.  And I'd gone out to where she li ved one da y, and she 

said, Betty -- I want to take you and Betty to dinner.  And she fixed me up at the hotel 

and Betty's in t he car with Dr. Rubenstein, and we go driving out  into the mountains Œ 

obviously, you know -- you know Tel Avi v and that area -- and there's an enclave up 
there where most of the official -- government officials live.  Very highl y secure.  And 
we get to the gate, and she sa ys, Do you have an identification card?  And I said, Of 

course.  And we get  to the gate, and this real hard-ass Israeli soldier at the gate, and he 

sees the li mo, so a little bit of respect, and he l eans in the back wi ndow and he says, Good 

evening, Mrs. Rath.  And she sa ys, How are you?  And she knows hi s name.  And he 

says, I'm just checking the names.  And he -- you know, Dr. Rubenstein, Captain Halpern 

-- or Major Halpern?  And I said, Yes, I am.  And we dri ve, and she says, Diane lives 
over here and so and so lives over here, and thi s is where 
--
 and we dri ve up, and we're 
going to a dinner party at a Minist er of Finance's house.  And the door opens up, and I'm 
wearing a jacket.  Everybody else is in evening culottes (ph).  And there are Sehgals on 

the wall and there's a Picasso on the wall, and they're not -- the y're not copies.  And she 
--

this charming woman, she says, Darling, t his i s m y friend Paul.  He's with Dr. Kissinger.  
And she sa ys to me, How's your -- how's your Hebrew?  And I sai d, Nonexistent.  And 

she sa ys -- I said, I speak a little -- I speak a li ttle French.  And she looks at me like 

phooe y, you know.  And she sa ys, Just a moment.  And she turns around and she sa ys, 
Ladies and gentlemen, in deference to our guest, English only, please.  And the rest of the 
evening nobody spoke anyt hing but Engli sh.  And there was a cocktail party.  There was 

everything.  So I sit down.  There's a very erect gentleman sitting next to me over here.  

There are very erect gentlemen sitting over here.  Absolutely military, no argument about 

it, sitting i n close.  And, remember, I am just t he navigator for the airplane that carries 

Kissinger's cars, but I'd been to Syria.  I just came out of Damascus.  And we start a 

conversation.  And finall y I said, Navy or Air Force?  And he said, Army.  And the other 
guy sa ys, Navy.  And I said, Gentlemen, I'm just a poor navigator, you know?  I said, I 
am an information officer, as you know, and you know that I've talked to your people at -

- at the airport.  I've tal ked to your people, but  there's nothing I can help you wit h, but I 

am honored that you would think that a poorly major -- you know.  And they -- t he y had 

just decided to put two people next to me that wanted to talk about -- and I knew nothing 

about Dr. Kissinger, except that he couldn't get it done.  He was under a lot of pressure to 

get it done.  His best friend, Joseph Alsop, died and he was supposed to be a pallbearer, 
and he wasn't allowed to come back.  He had t o get that peace mission.  So he missed his 
best friend's funeral because of that.  But it was quite an experience.  And Israel 's seen as 

a military man.  And then I flew the Israeli airl ift.  I flew the       Yom Kippur War, and 

we flew -- this is when our own country was told by our allies if we had trouble -- we 

Interview with Paul Halpern 
 
66 
flew out of the Azores, nonstop with a double crew carrying equipment to Tel Aviv, to 
Lod.   Lod.  Ben Gurion.  And we were tol d, in case of emergency, we could not land in 

Spain or France or anywhere.  And the y put their ranger, which is an American aircraft 

carrier, in the middle of the Mediterranean, and that was out, and they said -- so the 
question was:  Do you -- are you gonna control us?  What if we need to land?  Put it in 
the Mediterranean.  And we said, This airplane swims like a stone.  So every one of us 

said, If we're in t rouble, the first time that the French are gonna know that we're on their 

runways is when we land.  We're just gonna put it down.  We could see Italian and 

French bases coming down the Mediterranean.  We were gonna land.  So we were 

coming thi s wa y, and Aeroflot, the Soviets, were coming this wa y, and the y were going 

to -- the y were going to Egypt and we were going this wa y, and t he y were coming in.  
And, you know, English is the language of the -- of international ai r, and these Russian 
pilots had terrible command of the English language.  And the y would call Cypress and 

they would say, Cypress Control, this is -- this is Aeroflot so and so, and Cypress would 

start to talk to them, and we'd hid our microphones and just block out  -- block out that 

transmissi on.  And we drove them crazy.  And finall y, Cypress Control said, Military 

aircraft in the vicinity of such and such a positi on, stop your transmissions.  Because the y 

knew we were doing that, you know, because we were just flying.  It was -- and we got to 
-- we got to -- we got to -- you know, where Egypt -- Israel, and the Mirages came up for 
us and the migs came up for the -- and we coul d see each ot her.  And we just landed.  

And the y t urned us around.  You know, t he y t urned us around immediately.  And the y 

had taken all the first cl ass seats out of the -- out of the LR Air-Cranes (ph) and all the 

Interview with Paul Halpern 
 
67 
stewardesses, and so we were crew members, and I said, Just leave us your loadmaster 
and you guys -- and we'd like t o get something to eat.  And we had fresh orange juice and 

this and that.  You know, we had a -- we had a wonderful ti me.  And the y knew more 

about our ai rplanes, how to load our 141s, than our peopl e did.  And within two hours, all 
our flight plans were filed for us, all the weight s and measurement s were done, you 
know, our pilots had signed off.  And we knew how to get home, you know; 

Mediterranean, head east, head west.  And I did -- the total missi on was like 20 hours 

each ti m
e, and we would drop things off and we would pick things up and bring them 
back to the Azores.  And the lead commander of the Israeli Yom Kipper War airlift was a 

colonel who was the deputy commander at m y base, and I was a speech writer besides 

being a navigator, and his name was Wrigle y.  Like Wrigl e y -- Wrigl ey l ike W-r-i -g-l-e-
y.  He was a full colonel and he knew me because I used to write speeches for he and the 

general.  And we had a Jewish pil ot.  We -- you know, military airlift command, you 

don't fly set crews.  You just -- two pilot s, two navi -- you know.  And he came to me, 

and he says -- his name is Steve Tirshen (ph) 
--
 and Steve said, You know, we could 
make an all-Jewish crew.  Do you think we could get the first crew into Tel Aviv?  And I 

went to Colonel Wrigley, and I sai d to hi m, Steve Tirshen -- and Bob Rowe's (ph) the 

navigator and he's got a Jewish copilot and he can get a Jewish navigator.  Bob was a 
navigator who I knew for years.  The y want to be the number one aircraft.  And Wrigley 
said, Oka y.  Just l ike that.  And he was a -- he was a -- he was an Ekta (ph) goy, you 

know.  He -- and he -- so they put this airplane at number one air plan on this Erma and 

was gonna be this all-Jewish crew.  And I remember the pi lot's name.  His name was 

Interview with Paul Halpern 
 
68 
Steve Tirshen.  And they took off and the y lost an engine.  And they had to dump -- they 
had to dump out over t he Mediterranean -- over the -- over the Azores, South Atlantic, 

and make a t urn and come back in again, and Wrigle y went to number five in -- in line.  

Number two and three were ready t o go and number five was just  getting ready.  He put -
- he -- he hopped in the truck and he said to the crew, Take number fi ve.  And he let them 
-- he couldn't gi ve them t he number one, but he gave them the first open air plan, which I 

thought was, you know, a real nice touch for a military man, you know.  I was number 

four crewman, and I flew with a bunch of -- a bunch of goys.  But we went in and we -- 

the first ti me, and it  -- and then we had 12 hours on the ground.  We were two crews.  

And we were coming down the Mediterranean, and the Ranger sai d to us, You've got 

company.  And we look up and there are two Algerian migs sitti ng on our wing.  And 
the y're -- they're fl ying real close to us, and they're goi ng like t his, and ﬁblah,ﬂ you know, 
and all we do is we take -- we always have a camera, and we were j ust taking pictures 

and -- you know, t he official -- and they were fully voiced, and the Ranger said, You 

guys want company?  We said, We'd appreciate it.  And we look up and there were two 

Navy F
-4s appeared, and the -- look up and these F -4s are sitting directl y above t he two 
migs.  And the F-4s let down there, their props had slowly come down like this, and these 

guys are looking li ke this, and the y're on our wing.  And t he y finally got here and t he y 
accelerated and went on their wa y.  And the Ranger said, I think they've left.  We said, 
Yeah.  Thank you very much for the help.  And he did -- great stories that are -- never get 

told.  You know, I don't know if 
I'm 
-- I'm not breaking protocol because I'm not telli ng 

you any of the procedures, but it was -- it made me feel like a good Jew.  You know, it

it -- and I -- I was gone about 10 da ys, and on the last da y the y sai d, Who -- who's -- and 
they -- some of us were rotating out, and t he y brought us -- there

 I must have had 10 
dozen baby roses, j ust

flew home.  And I got home at 4: 00 in the morning.  4:00 in the morning.  And I filled the

night, and I went to bed.  And two days l ater, I'm --

Can't sa y anything about it at all.    But that'

Q: I'm sorry.

A: I said it was -- I said it was -- it is m y l ife, because I -- the Kindertransport saved my 

life.  I know that.  But i t -- it didn't affect me as a Jew.  The older I get and the more 

introspective I get and t he fact that most of my -- m y kids, the y all were bar mitzvahed 

but they're -- the y're assi milated Jews more than anything else, and they -- I -- 
I'v e 

become moreand mor
e introspecti ve about  it.  And I'm still -- because I lost m y wife, I'm 

not much of a -- I'm not much of a churchgoer, you know?  But at the same ti me, 

ethnically, I'm a very strong Jew, and I feel -- 
I feel very close 
-- close to what 's going on.  
And I think that probabl y I -- I could probably do the Hol ocaust Museum -- I could do the 
museum.  I hadn't been there.  I've been to the one in Richmond because m y son does a 

lot of work with t hem, but we'l l probably give it a shot.  I ma y -- I'll go there.  I'm sl owly 

coming to 
--
 to terms with it.  You know, I'm 78 -- I'm gonna be 78 years old.  I don't feel 
like it, but -- so I alwa ys kid with this -- this lady I go out with now, and I alwa ys sa y, 

You know, 20 years from now we're gonna -- and she says, Well, 
I may behere, you 

know, because she's only 70.  But  I'm not looking to make a mark.  I just -- I just  want t o 
understand more.  And I'm gett ing there.  I don't do a l ot of reading about it because the 
people who were there were too young to really understand.  I didn't go -- you know, I 
--
 
I talked to people who were -- who were in Auschwitz and who came out and some of my 

friends are survivors who hidden 
--
 who hid and were shot and things like this, and the 

Interview with Paul Halpern 
 
71 
people -- the y were al l young people, and young people don't think li ke us old people.  In 
retrospect, I'm beginning to understand more.  And you -- see, you have the advantage of 

watching me have this experience, and -- but  if you were experienci ng it right now, 50 

years from now it 's gonna be a different thing because you're gonna say i s, Oh, that's 
what scarred me; Oh, t hat's why I'm affected.  And all these little crazy t hings l ike 
knowing --  having had a friend who ate paper, but yet that was a mani festation of a child 

needing attention, a Jewish kid awa y from home, but I di dn't think about it like that.  My 

friend, Wolf (ph), ate paper, you know?  I flushed m y teddy bear down the toilet, you 

know?  I'm just saying, He y, somebody look over here, you know?  But you don't know 

that as it 's going on.  You do things and then why did you do it?  But  it makes life a lot of 

fun.  And, look, I'm a journalist and I -- I'm published.  I've -- I've written articles and I've 
written -- you know, but at the same ti me, I cannot sit down and writ e this stuff down.  
And I've told you a lot of stuff.  Like this story about m y father and the passports, it's a 

magnificent story.  Any Jewish newspaper, if I write it well, would pick it up.   

Q: Why do you think you can't write it down?   

A: I don't have the right words for it.  I don't have the right respect for it.  And I'm good.  

I mean, I can -- I can write.  I was a journal ist.  I'm a sports writer.  I can write features.  

You know why?  I've become too close to i t.  You tell me -- 
you coul d 
-- you tol d me that 
story, I could write it, l ike you probably could write this, too.  It 's just not -- and even 

though I'm a gadgeteer, you know, and I have full command of computers and I have full 

command of digital , I have upstairs a Sony tape recorder, which I was gonna take with 

Interview with Paul Halpern 
 
72 
me to listen, because -- but it's electronic and I can't do electronic.  I'm a typewriter guy, 
you know?   

Q: Sure.   

A: And even on the computer.  I have trouble on the computer because it's too easy.  And, 
you know, I -- I now have -- 
Ijust bought N
uance.  I bought voice so I can -- I -- it can 
t ype, and I find myself reading and sa ying, That's not how you spell t hat, instead of 

sayi ng, Just get it done.  And I have troubles.  I have started five or si x recollections 

about m y father and about my -- m
y 
-- can't finish them.  Because the people I lecture to 
on -- and I haven't done it in about three years because I was busy wi th m y wife.  The y 

want to hear a five year old.  The y want to hear the story that a five year old -- 
from a 

five-
year
-old aspect t hat -- the y want to hear the fact that I remember riding my bic ycle, 
that I was so -- not that  I was so affluent that I -- I could ri de m y bicycle in the dining 

room, but t he fact that I was a kid and this is how Holocaust affected me original ly was I 

rode my bic ycle around and I -- I -- I had a good father.  It was cold one night and we still 

had our nanny, and in our -- m y si ster and I had a room and there was a potbelly stove in 

the room, you know?  It was just as a convenience.  And my -- 
and my nanny 
lit  a fire 
and burned up about $50,000 wort h of money that my father had put away for emergency 

escape funds.  You know, those -- but the 
--
 but when I tell that st ory to people, they sa y, 
Well, that 's a lot of -- it's entertaining.  The Holocaust was not entertai ning, even though I 

tell it that wa y.  And I t ell m y grandkids, Dying hurts and there's no rerun from it , you 

know?  You know, bang, bang, bang, you're dead, and thi s and that, and the y shoot -- all  

the shoot 'em up games and, yeah, but if you come awa y from this game with the aspect 

Interview with Paul Halpern 
 
73 
that you can do something really reckless and once that game is over you can go back and 
do it -- undo it, you can't do it.  You get a shot  -- you know, particularl y 
--
 I tell a joke, 
Watch yourself when you fly.  I said, Dyi ng hurts.  And -- you know, and I -- not  that I -- 

I've been told.  Nobody has come back to tell me, but I know it does.  And, Just  be 
careful.  And -- but t hat 's not how life lives.  The bottom line is:  Be careful.  Be careful.  
But we weren't careful.  And, you know, kids toda y -- if I tried to t hrust one of my kids 

on the train, he would probably pop me one.  But we went because mom said we -- 
you 
know, mom and dad took me to the -- took me to the -- and Oma t ook me to the train.  It 's 

a different world.  It's a different world.   

Q: Did you tell your story to your children and grandchil dren?   

A: My kids know it.  My kids know it.  I made them -- I -- I was principal speaker    at -- 
m y synagogue did a Holocaust Memorial Garden, and a couple of -- couple of state 
senators were there and so on, and I gave t his l ittle speech.  It was real  funny.  The y told 

me 
-- asked me if I would do this, and I said, Oka y.  And I sat down to write the basic 
speech, and I hadn't -- I hadn't done Ki ndertransport speeches yet.  And I said, How much 

time do I have?  And they said, Oh, about five mi nutes.  I said, Just forget it.  I sai d, If 

you're gonna -- j ust so that that -- t hat state senator can -- can babble on about how 

wonderful you people are -- he had an Irish 
name 
-- I'm not -- I'm not pla ying second 
fiddle.  This is a memorial -- Holocaust memorial thing.  If you don't want to hear it -- 

Well, how much time you need?  I said, I just ran it through.  It 's 30 minutes.  Oh, that's 

way too long.  I said, Okay.  20?  The y sai d, Okay.  And I did 35 minutes, you know?  

But I said t o m y kids, Do me a favor -- and they weren't a member of m y synagogue -- 

Interview with Paul Halpern 
 
74 
check me out.  See how I'm doing, because I'm gonna be giving this talk at your school s 
pretty soon.  So -- and t hey said the y love i t.  And 35 mi nutes is good because school 

sessions are 40 minutes, you know, so I could -- I -- I haven't done it lately, and -- but 

Betty and I did teach reading in Camden.  She wanted to teach readi ng to adults.  And 
then, of course, when she -- when she had t he stroke, she couldn't -- for transport ation.  
So we taught first grade and second grade reading.  And when Betty -- and when Betty 

died, we -- people said, What do we donate to?  And we said, the Elizabeth Halpern 

Readers Fund.  And we got a lot of mone y, and we went to that Puerto Rican school or 

Hispanic school in Camden where we had taught reading, we said, What do you need?  

And every year we give them $500 worth of Readers Cl ub books.  And just t he other day, 

I went back -- for Rosh Hashanah, I went back to Lionsgate.  And we have this wonderful 
rabbi who was m y rabbi when he came out of reconstruction school, and he has done this 
siddur just  for us, you know, abbreviated session, and he's really -- and the auxi liary had 

given hi m the mone y for it.  But, you know, they're gonna need more and more.  So I 

went over and I said, I want to give you money for this.  And I gave them a check -- I 

remember the people at  that Lionsgate gave mone y to m y wife's fund, the Readers Club, 

and I took 
--
 just gave t hem $300 from the Elizabeth Halpern Readers Club to buy more 
siddurs, because that's reading.  That's reading.  You know?  That's not -- that 's not what 
the original intent was.  I ran -- 
and I 
-- I funded -- I funded -- I bri ng i t up to a thousand 
dollars every year, and it's only been t wo -- she's only been gone -- second anniversary.  
But we came down and I took it up to a thousand, and I said to her -- I said, Let me give 

you a coupl e hundred dollars and give me a check for $300 and I'll -- because that way 

Interview with Paul Halpern 
 
75 
it's tax free for you, you know, and it's tax free for me.  And I just thought it was a -- and 
she -- he sai d, Well, it already says who -- I said, Who cares?  You know, I just  -- you 

know, I like to do things like that.   

Q: Yeah.   One second.   I'll just pause and -- 
A: I'm all -- if I want to sum it up, I -- I am content.  I am -- I don't want to die, but we all 
do.  That 's too bad.  I -- I hope -- I hope to continue on for -- you know, I -- I want to be 

shot by a jealous husband and during the act, you know?  I mean, t hat's -- but    t hat's -- 

that's not gonna happen.  But I feel very -- 
I'm 
-- I'm content.  I look at -- I've got three 
productive children.  Two of them are married correctly.  The other one is a good mother.  

The y all had bought int o education.  The name's gonna go on.  And for that, 

Kindertransport, m y name is on because m y si ster's name is gone.  I mean, you know, she 
-- her married name, but she's gone.  But Hal pern goes on because of m y -- 
m y nine 
grandsons, six of them who -- three Œ yes, six of them have my name.  The other 
--
 the 
others are -- so I feel that I've accomplished somet hing.  I mean, you know, not hing -- 
nothing bi g deal, but without Kindertransport, I'm not here.  I'm not a dedicated -- 
you 
know, ma ybe I got too much of m y mother in me.  I -- I enjoy life, you know, a little bit.  

But I get angry, and I get -- I get angry because Rwanda happens and I get angry when 

Sarajevo happens, and I get overent husiast ic when Chile happens because, you know, 
there is sol ution -- there are solutions to this stuff.  I'm -- I just  -- I just want -- I j ust want 
to be remembered my 
--
 you know, Your grandpa was nuts, you know?  You know, or 
m y kids 
-- I want my --  m y grandkids to sa y, He was a ni ce guy.  He was a friend.  We 
could have a beer together.  Like I'm going to go have a beer with them at Founders -- 

Interview with Paul Halpern 
 
76 
you know, Founding Fathers restaurant -- Founding Fathers.  I didn't  get what I'm -- 
I'm 
not the greatest writ er in the world, and -- but I guess -- I guess I did all right, and I guess 
I'm gonna do al l right.  I mean, I -- 
I 
-- 

Q: Sure.   
A: This -- this -- and the interview i s not t he end of m y life, and I'm gonna go on to see -- 
I hope to -- I have no i dea whether -- you know, m y oldest is 25 and he's a fighter pil ot.  
He's not gonna get married for a while.  I'm a decision (ph) great-grandchildren, and I'd 

love to be able to go to a bar mitzvah of a grandchild.  And I go to bar mitzvahs and I -- 

and I have a good ti me.  And I'm a Jew, but I'm an -- 
I'm a 
-- I'm an ethnic Jew.  I'm -- I -- 

I'm a 
-- Lenny Bruce (ph) used to sa y, What is a Jew?  I said, If you eat white bread, 

you're a goy.  If you eat pumpernickel, you're a Jew.  I'm a pumperni ckel eater.  I l ike -- I 
like m y
