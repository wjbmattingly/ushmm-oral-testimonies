Question: This is a 
United States
 
Holocaust Memorial Museum
 interview wit h 
Mr. 
Shimo n Schwa rzschild
, on April 23
rd
, 2017, in 
Manhattan
, 
New York City
, 
New York
. Thank you very much for agreei ng to meet wi th us toda y, and to share 
your story. Before I ask all of the questions related to your bio, could you tell me, 
how do you pronounce your name properly?  I™m not sure if I got it.  
Answer: That™s wha Œ thank you for sa ying that, I was goi ng to i nterrupt you. The 
different parts of my family pronounce it differently. I pronounce it in a more 

German wa y, which is 
Schwarzshield
(ph). 
Q: 
Schwarzshield
(ph), oka y. 

A: Cause it comes Œ it means black shield, or black coat of arms. However, other 

parts of my family have gone to 
Schwarzschild
. So I am 
Schwa rz
shield
(ph),
 
Shimo n Schwa rzshield
(ph).  
Q: 
Schwarzshield
(ph), oka y. And tell me, was 
Shimon 
your name at  birth?  
A: It wa Œ i t was my name at birth, and then i-
i 
Œ m y parents, who were Orthodox 

Jewish in a small t own, had two lifestyles the y lived by. The y h Œ they Œ  they had 

their Jewish names. My father, for example, was 
Abraham
, and they had their 
token to assi milati on, their Germanic names, and his Germanic name, if you™ll 

pardon the expressi on, was 
Adolf
.

Q: Oh no, really? 
A: And in m y case, I was born 
Sh
i mo n
, but 
Œ but my Germanic name that I lived 
for my whole lifetime in 
Germany
 was 
Siegbert
. 
Q: 
Sieg bert
. 
A: And then when I came to this country, I changed it to 
Bert
. And one da y in Œ of 
course in 
California
, where else, up in a redwoods trees, I had t his flash that said, 

you™ve alwa ys liked the sound of 
Shi mon
, and 
Bert Schwarzschild
 is so guttural, 

and I went to all the bay Œ  I-I went  to, almost i nstinctively to the banks, to the social 

security, everywhere, and I took back
 
Shimon
. 

Q: And about Œ 

A: And that™s about 20 years ago, or longer. 

Q: Oh, so when you were in your 70s already. 
A: Pardon? I was Œ 
Q: So Œ 

A: Œ yeah, i n m y 60s, ma ybe.  
Q: In your 60s. 

A: Or somewhere like that. 

Q: So Œ so you had lived a great portion of your life as 
Bert
.  
A: As 
Bert
, that™s right .

Q: Wow.
 
A: I Œ 
so, whenI Google m yself,the
-there™s a life at 
Bert
, and a li Œ 
and mor 
Œ t he Œ 
and a more recent life at 
Shimo n
.  
Q: And just a question of curiosit y, I hadn™t heard that before, though I™m sure 

many, many people did so, that you have a name that is reflective of Orthodox 
Judaism, and then another name that is more assimilation Œ 
A: 
Germani c 
Siegbert
, l
ike 
sieg heil
. I hate to say it, you know. 
Q: Can you tell me, wa Œ was there a formal  way? Did you have t o se Œ 
did your 

parents have to have formal documents that had one name, or coul d they have bot h? 

Beca 
Œ I ask this, because later Œ 

A: Well, when we first came here, I was 
Siegbert
. 

Q: Oka y. 
A: And Œ and Œ 
Q: That™s t o the uni Œ 
United States
? 
A: Œ I was in the navy, and the y used the name of 
Siegbert
. And I Œ and believe it 
or not, when we came t o this country as refugees, we had enemy a-ali en Œ we ha Œ 

we were classi Œ enemy al iens, and we had an enemy alien 
I
.
D
.card with my 

Siegbert
 on it, and we were not all owed to leave 25 miles of 
Jersey City
, or have a 
shortwave radio, which is kind of an interesting thing about Œ

Q: And how long did that last, this enemy alien Œ 
A: It lasted pretty much until I went into the navy, at ma ybe a Œ 18, and became Œ 

and then my parents became derivat ives Œ got derivative ci tizenship paper. I™m not 

sure exactly when t he enem y alien category st opped. It was there for the war, I 

believe, for the duration of the war. So I was i n the navy for the durat ion of the war, 
but Œ but we were cl assified as enem y aliens. 
Q: Do you think you were an enem y alien whi le you were in the navy? 

A: No, I think Œ I Œ I don™t know what m y stat us was then wa Œ 

Q: Oka y. 

A: Œ it opened a lot of doors, because once I was in the navy, then m y parents were 

Œ that gave me citizenship in some strange way, and then m y parents were able to Œ 

the y exped Œ were able to expedite getting citi zenship papers. They Œ  
Q: And in 
Germany
, do you know whether in 
Germany
 there was a way of 
recording both your Jewish name, and your Germanic type name, officially, or was 

that they had to choose one or the other? 

A: I think t hat we were in 
Germany
. I was only known as 
Siegbert
, and myfather 
was only known as 
Adolf
. But what happened is, there were also Jewish records, 

but what happened, what I understand from Œ from the archivist who Œ who 

rediscovered, and gave me my family tree

Q: Œ and were allowed to have land. You know, the y Œ t he y weren™t allowed to Œ I 
mean, in general, under the Russian empire, it was a different system of land 

distribution, and who owned it. Jews managed estates, but  very few had Œ were 

farmers themselves. But it was another form of exclusion. 

A: I think t hat Œ that exclusion also went on in Œ in m y region Œ 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ because even though m y parents were cattle dealers, and their parents Œ 
m y 
father™s father was a cattle dealer, t he y didn™t have big amounts of land. They had Œ 

they owned a house, in Œ in the vil lage of 
Dettingen
. And then m y grandfather m
o 
Œ 
bought a house in 
Werthei m
, and that™s where m y f
atherandhis brother moved to, 
to continue their Œ their cattle business, even Œ even though this meant  Œ in those 

days, ha Œ being a cattl e dealer meant going on a bic ycle every morni ng Œ 
Q: Really? 
A: Œ to all the villages, to find out who Œ 
what farmer
s were Œ were interested in 
selling a cow, or what farmers were interested in buying a cow. So my father Œ there 

were no cars Œ he would go out on a bic ycle to Œ and I would sit on the bic ycle if I 

went out with hi m, to t hese different villages. And he would have, in each village, 

he would have a no Œ a non-Jewish schmoozer. 

Q: Really?

A: A man who was like his Œ his e yes and ears. And the first thing he would do in 
the village, he woul d meet with the schmoozer in a beer garden, and then the 

schmoozer would
 t ell him the latest Œ what  farmer had his cow, wanted to sell it , or 

wanted to buy one. And then he would get Œ the schmoozer woul d get a commi ssion 

Œ 
Q: I was going to ask, yeah. 
A: Œ if m y father bought or sold a cow that he had told hi m about. 

Q: Now, did your father also have competit ion? 

A: Yes, yes, there were other Jews who were also cattle dealers. There weren™t that 

many in our region, but every Wednesda y, t here would be a market place, right near 

our house, by the ri ver, where all of the people, the Œ the cow Œ the cattle dealers 

would bring their cows, and farmers. And t hen you meet th-the Œ the Œ the people 
from the bi gger cities, who were Œ worked for meat packing firms would come, and 
there would be big negotiations, and I would hear them ar-
ar
gue over price, and 
then there would be thi s Œ I would hear thi s gi gantic clap. There were no invoices, 

and no purchase orders, and once t hat clap took place, the lives of the people were 

behind this Œ 
this transaction.
 
Q: Oh, how interesting. 

A: And that™s how the cows were bought and sold in Œ in the Œ

Q: How interesting. 
A: Œ when I was a kid. And then Œ and m y fat her would so-someti mes argue, t
h ey 

would get to so many marks Œ 

Q: Oka y. 

A: Œ and before the y would clap, he woul d also sa y, and 10 marks 
trinkgeld
 for the 
children, which meant, 
a 
additional 10 marks for m y savings account. 
Q: And did he get it? 

A: And the y would argue over that, and the y would be included, and then I would 

feel good, be Œ I never saw the mone y, because it went into a bank account. But it 

would include five or 10 marks of 
trinkgeld
 for the children. 
Q: How cool is that?  

A: Yeah, yeah. 
Q: You know, it must have been like a Œ I can imagine, as a little kid, to be 
accompanyi ng your father as he does his busi ness is a very i mportant role. And then 

to witness this is also interesting, cause for ki ds, everything is interesting. 

A: I know.  

Q: Yeah. 

A: And act ually, you know, my biography that I™m writing, I Œ I Œ I™m titling it ,

but what would happen is, when we got to a vi llage, and you got i nto a tavern, I 
would be thirsty, and Œ and Œ and t here was a Œ 
ye 
Œ he would someti mes buy me a 
soda, called 
Sha rba so
(ph), which was the name of the company. 
Q: 
Sharbaso
(ph)? 

A: 
Sharbaso
(ph). And we Œ when I was in 
Werthei m
 the last time, the e Œ the 
deputy ma yor actually showed me an old advertising, with the name 
Sha rba so
(ph) 
on it, it doesn™t exi st any more. Which was a name of an early pop Œ pop drink. 
Q: What di d it taste like? 

A: Well, it was sweet. I don™t Œ I™m not sure any more whether it had bubbles in it. I 

think it had bubbles. 

Q: So it™s carbonat ed. 

A: But Œ but Œ but then he would sa y, every now and then, either it wasn™t there, or 
he didn™t want to spend the money on it, and he would sa y to me, drink 
wasser wie
 
das liebe
 
vieh
 
und denke es ist
 
Krambambuli
. W
hich  translated means, drink 
water like the dear cows, and think it is 
Krambambuli
, and I never knew what 
Krambambuli
 was until recently when I 
G oogled
 it, and I found fe Œ 
[break] Œ 
and he was depressed, and he never Œ he Œ he never really l earned t he language. It ™s 
a real 
reversal . My mot her was the ballbuster, was up from six a.m. to midnight, 

working and cleaning t he house, and sh Œ when we came here, she bec
ame

emancipated. She found a job wit hin da ys, whereas m y father was l ucky if he could 
keep some j ob in worki ng in a butcher store, a baker, move around sacks of 

something, or a ni ght watchman, he had a night watchman job, until some burglars 

came in and Œ while he was asleep on one of the department store beds, and Œ 
an
-
and Œ and he was fired from the job, I remember that. My father was Œ had a hard 
time in this country, and my mother was a ball buster here, she Œ she worked from 
10 in the morning til six at night, and took care of all of us, and cooked the suppers 

in advance, or e Œ so my father, who woul d usually be Œ often home and 

unemployed, would heat up the st ove Œ the Œ t he meals for us when we Œ 
when we 

came home from school. 

Q: Wow.
 

A: Yeah. So Œ so Œ 
Q: That™s very sad for him, yeah. 
A: Œ so he Œ he was a very nostalgic, and very, as I said, romanticist. I wouldn™t sa y 

that he was a happy go lucky person; he wasn™t. He was in World War I. He was Œ 

he was injured, and he Œ 
an
-and he kind of had some physical suffering and pain, 
from broken ribs that he Œ he had not Œ not Œ not in a Œ in battle, but he had to take 

care of some horses, as a soldier, and one of the horses Œ 

Q: Kicked him? 

 
Interview with Shimon Schwarzschild

A: Œ kicked him in the ribs. And Œ and so Œ so a lot of people saw hi m as sad and 
sardonic. But on Frida y night, when we Œ because we were Orthodox, we would Œ 

he would Œ  we would lie on the couch, and he would Œ we would sing songs, and Œ 

and Œ or he would t ell the stories. 

Q: That was my next question, is, was he a storyteller? 
A: He was a storyteller also. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: A-And Œ and he would often read the st ories, you know. But Œ but he also told 

stories, yeah.
 

Q: Wa 
Œ and was this a difference from how he had been i n 
Germany
? From how 
you remember him from 
Germany
?  
A: Y
ou mean
 
when he came here?
 
Q: Yeah. In 
Germany
, was he a different type of personality? 
A: Yes, yes. He Œ he sti ll enjoyed being home, he was not a Œ you know, he was not 

like some of the other Germans in the town, who were always walking to the 

marktplatz
 and dri nking beer in t he Œ in the taverns. But Œ but i n thi s country, he 

became very sedate, a
nd in the sense that he Œ he would not want to leave the house. 
And Œ and if we wanted to go to a movie house, m y mot her, who was so full of

energy, would literally push hi m off the couch, push hi m towards the door, put a hat 
on his head, to Œ t o Œ to get hi m to go out with us. 

Q: That™s so sad. 

A: And Œ and he would feel secure at home. He wou Œ he would have a stamp Œ he 

had a stamp collecti on, and he would work on the stamp collection, or Œ he wasn™t 
much of a reader. I think it was more a kind of a form of depression, you know. He 
would sa y Œ one of his favorite phrases that  I remember is, 
das wasser hat keine 

ba lken
, you know. 

Q: The water has no Œ 

A: Locks to hold onto for s Œ for life support. When we tal ked about going out Œ he 

would not vote. Well, of course, 
Jersey City
 had a very crooked ma yor. But he 
would not vote, and the only Œ and what would happen, he™d be Œ he would allow 
hi mself to be intimidat ed. The ward 
[indecipherable]
 come to our house, and 
would insi st that he go, and he literally would push hi m out to t he precinct voting 

place. And that™s the only ti Œ because he felt all politicians were crooks. But he 

would allow hi mself to be somewhat bamboozled, you know. Yeah. 

Q: Sad. 

A: But he was a very gentle father, and I appreciated that Œ that si de of his. He 

actually, finally did find a profession again, because his brother and he Œ his brother

was a housepainter, and the y went into partnership again. They were partners in t he 
cow business, and the y went into partnership painting apartments in 
New York 
City
. I didn™t know the exact nature of Œ 
Q: Of course not, but Œ 

A: Œ o-of Œ you know. 
Q: Œ but you wanted to be part of, you know Œ  

A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: Œ like Œ like you wanted to be part of your brother™s stable. 

A: Because I had been such an intrinsic part. Before the 
Hitler 
era, and propaganda, 

I would spend a lot  of time in their homes, I would do thi ngs wi th them. We Œ our 

town would be flooded every year, and I have this vivid memory, the water from 

the river would come i nto the streets, and we would put on Œ we would put on our 
stilt Œ we would take st ilts and we would pla y in the water, or we™d bi cycl e through 
the water, you know. We did all kinds of kid stuff, or we would go up to the 

ha ider
(ph)  where Œ  and we™d scale the wal ls of the castle. The castle was broken 
down. We did things that now are so 
verboten
 Œ 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ it isn™t even funny. The y reconstructed the castle, it™s called 
Klein H
eidelberg
, 
small 
Hei delberg
, you know. And it™s now beautiful, and there are concerts and 

 
Interview with Shimon Schwarzschild

musical events, and restaur Œ restaurants and everything in that castle. But when we 
were there, was a ruin. And there was fences Œ a hole in, that we woul d go to. It 

wasn™t even covered. And the Œ and we were t old that Œ there were all these 

folklores, that the Œ the robber baron for our castle would kidnap rich merchants, 

put them i n the bottom of this dungeon until they got ransom, and if they didn™t get 
ransom, the
y remained 
Œ 
Q: There. 
A: Œ remained there. And we used to go and t hrow rocks down t o Œ and Œ and Œ to 

see this 
[phone ri nging]
 Œ 
that™s okay 
Œ t o see how long it would take for the rock 
to hit bott om, you know, in this dungeon. 
[break] Œ 
the glass making 
factories 
there, and Œ and so they had been expropriated, and they had been refugees, and 

the y had experienced some of the problems that it Œ Jews had. So they were 
amongst the Œ a major initiative to fund and bring back the Jews to 
Werthei m
.  
Q: How interesting. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: How interesting. 

A: And I met many of them, and one of them, who was one of the big glass 

manufacturers, and was the founder o-of Œ which is now a very famous glass 

museum in 
Wertheim
, the y Œ they offered m y family this wonderful mansion

overlooking the castle, and provided us wi th a 
VW 
convertible, because the y 
happened to be on vacation, and t he y just turned it over for us to utili ze. And Œ and 
Œ and Œ and you know, and the other Jews who came back. When I came back Œ w-

we didn™t al l co me at once, so there was just maybe like a Œ a half a dozen, or a 

dozen families who were wined and dined, and Œ and Œ and Œ and we were hosted 
by all these different people in 
Werthei m
, but many of them from the Œ the 
community of 
Œ of the Œ 
Q: From 
Dresd
en
, yeah.
 
A: Œ the east r Œ the east German emigres Œ emigres to 
Werthei m
.  
Q: Well, you know, that Œ that™s also a story in itself, is that relati onship between 
west Germans and east Germans. And Œ 

A: Or was it a Œ 
Q: 
Wessie
 and 
Ossie
. 
A: That™s ri ght. 

Q: Particularly when there was still  the wal l there, and the different world 

experiences that they had, the different views of one another that t hey had. And 

depending on when these people came from 
Dresden
, whether thi s was right after 
the war, or before that wall became impermeable. But yes, there was a different 

sensibility, you know, i n that country, which is one of the tragedies of it. Let™s turn

now though, to another Œ a factual thing, just so that I can anchor t his. Were Œ did 
your parent s also come back during that ti me, or was this just you? 

A: Very Œ i t™s very interesting. My brother and I each received invitati on. The 

ma yor had actually visi ted m y mother and m y brother, and Œ and Œ 
and m y mother 

fell in love with hi m, actually. But when Œ when Œ but m y family took the initiat ive, 
I took the initiative. My brother did not, and he refused to go back. For hi m, it was 
more an emotional t hing. But he had Œ he had actually gone to 
Wertheim
 
as a 
G
.
I
., 
he was part of the occupation force Œ forces that occupied 
Fra nkfurt
, and Œ 
and he 
actually went t Œ past 
Werthei m
, but he emotionally felt he could not return. He 
also Œ wa- was a lack of forgiveness involved, also. And m y uncle, the uncle I was 

telling you about, he consider Œ call ed me a traitor for going back. I felt like I had 

unfinished business in 
Werthei m
. I had as much unfinished business in 
Werthei m
 
as the peopl e who were dealing with the guilt complexes had, in i nvit ing us back. 

And I felt that I wanted to get past that. 

Q: So I have another Œ 

A: And i
t was 
Œ for me, I felt it was like a t ransaction Œ  
Q: And Œ 

A: Œ for me to go back, and Œ and revisit t he pl ace I had left. 

Q: And did you find that unfinished busi ness, and were you able to finish it?

A: Yes. One of the things that I pondered over, and Œ and I hope Œ well, if you get a 
chance to read m y memoirs, I wrote a poem called ﬁ
Return to

Q: Do you know i t by heart? 

A: I think i t™s important, you know, ma ybe I should Œ I Œ  I woul d love to read it, it™s 

short. 
Q: I would very much l ike for you to read it. 
A: I™d love to read it and Œ and then talk about it, because i t Œ it sums up Œ 

Q: Let™s do that. 

A: Œ the range of feelings. Can I do that now?  

Q: Absolutely.

or just luck, that within da ys after my moment  of rec-reconciliation, I should 
receive an invitation to return to 
Wertheim
, as a guest of its mayor and its 
residents, who until now, I had rejected and renounced. I returned t o 
Werthei m
 
with apprehension and hope, to rediscover the memories I had left behind. To 

rediscover t he aborted part of my childhood life. To rediscover myself. Now I 
reconnected with my cl assmates, who I had seen last, when the y shunned me, as 
they were 
dutily
 Œ duti full y indoctrinated to do in their eugenics classes, from

from the knife, then we will all be free. Deep physical wounds leave permanent 
scars. Mental wounds are no different. Their scars are hidden, but there, capable of 

flaring again. My return to

to look at t hem closely, to pay attention to them. But also, to see them i n

A: No, it didn™t, you know, really it didn™t. Well, I did a little bit of maybe making 
some corrections, but by and large, the whole thing came out because I remember 

that when I read it, I read it in class, you know, we were li ke in a class, and the 

teacher asked us to read it, and she said that™s a very powerful poem, you shoul d try 

to get Œ read it to ot hers, you know? And I did actually do that for a while, in

emptiness cannot ease the terrible deed. The synagogue of

gone, but memories linger on, wit h Jewish survivors and Nazi™s collaborators ali ke, 

those few that are st ill alive, contemplating their own imminent departure, their own 
past, present and future, and the final judgment being made in the hereafter of their 
lives. Sequel: I walk past that empty, holy spot, to the modest cott age across the 

street, where my grandparents once lived, and cross the street to pr Œ to pra y, thei r 

house still standing, as a witness t o the past, the sweet and terrible past. Except for

earlier that it was like t herapy.

they Œ the y Œ so the y could Œ the y were not al lowed to be in the Œ in the trades, and

mostly on 
Œ on a satur Œ and we 
played a lot  with children, even though we Œ Orthodox Jews, we didn™t live in an 

Orthodox community, as such, you know, we were spread out over the town, so we 
did a lot of playing with Œ with non-Jewi sh kids, who were cro Œ who lived to Œ 
down the street, or across the street from us. So during the week we did a lot of 

playing wi-with Œ with other children, and on Œ on Saturday we™d be at home, we 
had an old phonograph. My father Œ we™d get t ogether on Friday night. We would 

someti mes walk to a Œ 
a 
Œ 
a 
Œ to the river, where we woul d bring a Œ breadcrumbs 
to put in the water for t he fish, or something like that. Although I think that was

them together. I Œ I Œ I Œ it™s a little bit haz y in my mind Œ  

Q: Whatabout your moth 
Œ  
A: Œ cause I left when I Œ we left when I was 10. 

Q: Yeah. What about your mother? Did she have ti me to spend with t he kids like 
yo
ur father did, or l ess so? 
A: Well, she was always Œ I mean, she spend most of her time in the house, if Œ far 
as I can remember. And Œ and Œ but she alone couldn™t apparently do it all, because 

we did have the hel p from some of the Œ from a woman, someone from t he villages, 

who someti mes came to help. Bu-But Œ but her main Œ her main domain was the 

house and t he children, and family. And t hat™s why I felt she became emancipated 

when she came here. 
Q: Who would you say had the greater influence on you? 
A: W
ell, as far as the Œ m y sense of romance, you know, my father. And Œ 
and I 
Œ I 
Œ I don™t have that kind of vague picture. I ma Œ I could run to m y mother for 

comfort, you know, if I Œ if Œ if I fell, or if I had Œ I had a hard time with m y 

brother, because he was two years older, and he had his own circle of friends, and I 

fa

A: Œ crying and running to my mother, a-a-and she was alwa ys t here for me in that 

Œ in that wa y. I Œ she was Œ and in later life, in Œ here, she was extremely opti mistic, 

she was extremely pro-life, she was extremely war Œ generous to us as growing up 

children and young men, you know. I had a hard ti me someti mes with it, because 
she also had Œ she had a lot of mantras, and one of the mantras was be nice, be go Œ 
good. And do Œ you know, be nice to other people, and be good, you know. And Œ 

and I had Œ it took me a lifetime to Œ to get past some of those mantras. But she was 

v ery,
 very pro-life. 
Q: By pro-
life you mean 
Œ 
A: And she was very much for us, you know, she ha Œ she helped t o give m y 

brother and me the mot ivation, the life motivation, just i n general. 
Q: That™s quite a gift. 
A: Yeah, oh yeah. 

Q: That™s quite a gift. 

A: Yeah. And she was just very proud of us, and I had an uncle who Œ who was a 

real problem uncle, and when my brother became an 
M

you saving whales? Why can™t you be just a ni Œ a Jewish businessman, you know? 
And m y mother would not only defend me, she would sa y, what™s wrong with 

saving whales, you know. And thi s brother, you Œ everyone had Œ everyone had 

problems in standi ng up to hi m, because he was so tyrannical. 

Q: Her brother? 
A: Her brother. Her favorite brother was very tyrannical, and Œ and Œ and just 
practically destroyed his son, as a child. As a child, you know. 

Q: Yeah, when Œ when parents are so negati ve to children, it Œ it really is a price 

they pa y for Œ you know, for that. 
[background noise

I can Œ let™s Œ let™s

[brea k]
 Oka y, so your father would take you with

A: Oka y, not every day, but often. 
Q: Did he take your brother, too? 
A: He did, but I Œ I don™t remember that as much as m yself riding on this bic ycle, 

and going with hi m. So, he must have. 

Q: Oka y.

Q: That™s early. 
A: Because there woul d be Œ there could be as many as 10 Œ 
Q: Oka y. 

A: Œ 
or15 cows. And 
Œ  and he would feed them. It wasn™t just a sales operation,

Q: So he had bought them up from the local farmers, from his schmoozer, that hi s 

schmoozer had 
Œ

to be

A: On the Œ on the bi Œ occasionally. I wouldn™t accompany him every da y. I would 
do a lot of Œ I did a lot of playing. We had Œ we lived two blocks away from the 
street that went up i nto the Œ into the hills, into the

this fantastic castle. And we woul d Œ 
we woul d 
Œ I woul d Œ I Œ that Œ I™ve forgotten. 
See, and I™m glad you asking. I spent most of my da ys with other children, no Œ 
Jewish or non-Jewish, mostly non-Jewish, because other t han Œ somehow, there was 
the Jewish community in the synagogue, and there was the Jewish rabbi that we 

took lessons with, but there was not a strong community that Œ where children 

interacted wi th each ot her.  

Q: So no real social life? 

A: So most of m y friends were non-Jewish. I Œ I had only Œ  

Q: Oka y, neighborhood kids? 
A: Œ 
in my class, my 
Œ 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ m y school, m y elementary school class of about 30, there was onl y one other 

Jewish child in my part icular class. 

Q: Oh wow. 

A: 
Ilsa

A:

Q: Oka y. 
A: And Œ and Œ and so, that™s why the whole experience was so pai nful for me, 

because all t hese chil dren, when Œ when Œ when 
Hitler 
came in power, and these Œ 

a-and the Nazis s
tarted prevailing, the ywould go 
Œ we all went to school together, 
from different parts of the city, but  the y would go also into eugeni cs cl asses, where 

they were taught to Œ about the inferiority of Jews, and the y Œ and they stopped Œ 

slowly stopped playing with me, because Œ because the y were told that the y Œ well, 

they Œ I remember one day Œ this Œ this is very vivid. It™s in m y biography. I 
remember one day walking to school by m yself, because the school wasn™t that far 

away, and Œ and Œ and there is Œ there was a Œ like a glass covered stand in front of 

the school, with a newspaper inside, and the newspaper was ﬁ
Der Stü
rmer
.ﬂ And 
on the front page, there was a picture of a group of long-bearded, black clothed 

Jews with pra yer locks, sucking bl ood from a baby in the middle of the Œ of them. 

And Œ and so, that™s the kind of propaganda t hat the y were subjected to. And so, 

slowly, every Œ 
the y started 
Œ stopped playi ng with me. This is t owards the end, 
before we left, in many Œ 
over many mont hs. Andevery no
w and then a ca Œ some 

kid would pla y wi th me, and then suddenly remember that I was Jewish. And I 

remember that, and I remember sometimes the Œ I was jeal ous also. That™s the other

Œ another si de of me. I would see t he fireplaces on the hillside, where th
e young 
kids who were now all becoming 
Hitler
 youth, with their brown une Œ little 
uniforms, and their backpacks, which the y would fill with stones, to build up their 

bodies. The y woul d be Œ they would Œ I would see fires, and they would be 

swearing their allegiance to the führer in Œ in Œ up on the hillside. And I wa Œ to 
some extent , I was jealous. 
[break] 
Œ
 you know. 
Q: Yeah. So you would pla y toget her? 

A: Yeah, we would play, and do a lot of things together, i n the Œ in t he winter, 

around Christ mast ime, we would Œ they would Œ the y had Œ 
they woul dn™t 
Œ they 
would Œ and it™s again, the war, the war mental it y. Now it  Œ when I thi nk back Œ I™m 

a peacenik now, of course. Th-
The y would m
- make lead soldiers by t he hundreds, it 
seemed, they woul d make armies. And the y actually had a Œ an outfitter, like the y 
would melt lead. And I would be up Œ up there watching t hem do it, I™d Œ we did Œ I 
didn™thave my ownlead makingset, you know.
 

Q: Oh, so the chil dren would get l ead making sets that could make soldiers out of 

them? 

A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yes. At home, I Œ at their homes, I would see them make these 

lead soldiers, you know. 

Q: Well, that sounds like fun.

Q: Yeah. 

A: And we would also Œ so metimes I remember Œ I have this visi on, actually, I have 

a photograph, we would do Œ mimi Œ mimic marching. This is all pre-Nazi, and Œ  

Q: Did you Œ did you have best friends amongst all the children? 
A: I had a couple of best friends, and one of them Œ this is a real irony Œ one of them 
was a very good friend, but we became better friends as a result of all the Nazi 

propaganda, because he had Œ he had a crippl ed leg from infantile paral ysis. 

Herbert Koch
 
was his name.
 
Q: 
Herbert Koch
. 
A: Yeah. And he could not march with the other kids. And the irony was that his 

uncle was one of the worst Nazis i n the town, and he actual ly ran t he explosive 
factory that the allies bombed. The only time t hey bombed 
Werthei m
 was to get 
this explosive factory. 
Q:Oh m y goodn
ess. 

A: And Œ and hi Œ and we were good friends, but Œ but ultimately, before we left, 

that friendship also went. And you know, when I came back Œ you know, I Œ we 

haven™t got to that yet, but when I came back we ha Œ 
we literally hadgroup

A: I went back to 
Wertheim
.  
Q: And that Œ and you were at Œ thi s wa Œ it sounds like several t imes you™ve gone 

back. 

A: Yeah. The first ti me I went back, the y had a mayor, 
Josef Scheuermann
,
 
who 

was Œ and I believe him, by the way, and everyone else has corroborated, was very 
anti-Nazi as 
a 
Œ growing up as a child. His best friend was Jewish. He lived in Œ in a 
larger city, he didn™t li ve in 
Werthei m
.And ulti mately, hewent to 
Werthei m
, 
became the 
Œ the ma yor. A-And Œ and Œ I start ed to make a point, and now I™m 
trying to t hink what Œ what it was. 
Q: It was, t he first ti me you went back, and then there was the Œ t he ma yor, who Œ 

A: The init iative, ri ght.  

Q: Right. 

 
Interview with Shimon Schwarzschild

A: He Œ he went and Œ he went and searched for all the surviving Jews, all over t he 
world. He went to
 Israel
, he went t o germ Œ he went to the 
U
.
S
., hevisited m y 

mother. He visit Œ he went to every country to invite Œ to invite them Œ the Œ the Œ 

the surviving Jews back to
 
Wertheim
. And the Œ the interesting thing was, that t he 
initiative to invite t he Jews back, got the Œ and the mone y to pay for t he Œ to Œ the in 
Œ invitation included a plane ticket, and they arranged for accommodations. And the 
mai n financial initiative came from a group of ger Œ of G
ermans, of 
Werthei m 
residents, who were East Germans at the end of the war. The y were part of the 

glassmaking industry. They were t he craftspeople who lived in t he 
Dresden
 
area. 
And when the Russians came and invaded, they fled. And the y had to find a place to 

go, and the y somehow found their wa y to 
Werthei m
, where they were treated very 
hostilely, like Œ you know, like th Œ I had Œ I had this kinship with them, you know, 
the y were treated like Œ not quite l ike the enemy, but like outsiders. And ulti mately, 

they became the soci al Œ the rich community of

A: Oka y, it™s called ﬁ
Return to Wertheim
.ﬂﬁI™ve made m y peace wi ththepast, 

m y peace wi th the Germans. Not with the 
SS
 trooper Œ troops who goose-stepped 
past our house one dark forbidding night, thei r black, shiny boot s reverberating on 
cobblestones, singing, no, shouti ng in o Œ in cadence, when the Jewish blood spurts 
from the knife, then we will all be free. The tune has etched itself so deeply in t he 

cells and inner rec-recesses of my brain, t hat I find m yself humming t he gruesome 

words, and the musical  cadence that emerged t ogether, until I am start led by the 

memory of that night, and by Œ and by m y masochistic instinct to remember the 

event, an epi c, that turned me into a scared kid. We fled the bubbli ng cauldron that 

was to become the Holocaust, and crossed the 
Atlantic
, t o the land of cowboys, 
Indians, and streets paved with gol d. To jobless 
America
, in Depression, but 
breathing the air of freedom. As t he family eked out a livi ng, each one of us 
working for the Yankee dollar, in order to survive and thrive, strangers in a strange 

land. I was hurt by our frantic, frenetic exodus, and angry too. I hated everything 

German, even though I was German, too. Reminding myself that m y family, and the 

town™s Jewish communit y, too, had our roots in 
Werthei m

insult to t he dead. Wasn™t it enough that they had toppled and smashed the lives of 
the living? I joined the navy to fight the Germans, and was sent to the 
Pacific
, in 

true snafu fashion, to fight the Japanese instead. In the postwar era, I shunned 

everything German. I refused to socialize and fraternize with Germans. I refused to 

buy anything German. I refused to make love to Germans. I refused t o ride in a 
German car, especially the 
Volkswagen
 that 
H itler
 had ext olled. Unti l one day, I 
confronted myself with this enigma. 
Hitler 
stereotyped all Jews, as universally evil, 
to be excised, gassed, eradicated, destroyed. Now, I was stereotyping all Germans, 

shunning and reviling them, finding them all universally guilty, declaring them all 

universally responsible for the death of seven million Jewish brethrens. I woke up to 

the realization that post war Germans who were born after 
Hitler
, were as guilty of 

the Holocaust cruelties, as I was guilty of the native American holocaust that 
occurred 100 years ago, right here in 
California
, a bounty on their scalps. Right 
here, in the good ol d 
USA
, the land of 
Washington
 and 
Lincoln
, the land of 
W o unded Knee
, and 
My Lai 
massacres, and many more. So I made a conscious 
decisionto stop m y own
 brand of blind hate and intolerance. The same kind that I 

experienced from the Nazi bullies in their time, who shouted obscenities and i nsults 

at me, without ever bothering to know me. A heavy weight lifted from m y 

shoulders, the good vibes that I now felt, must have echoed, reverberated,

Tha-
That ma ybe 
Œ maybe if I should go back again, that would be something I sh Œ 
really shoul d explore, except not Œ there™s only one classmate left, and he is sort of 

m y friend and host . And you know, there are a lot of unanswered questions, and Œ 

and I Œ I Œ I s Œ don™t know what a lot of the people were doing. The y were all 

caught up i n Œ in t heir l ives. My br Œ the one classmate who™s left was Œ was in Œ

years, or three years, he was in a Russian Œ the worst possible condition Ru-Russian 
prison camp, and he survived, and ultimately he came back. I don™t know whether 
he joined the Nazi part y or not, the chances are, he did. Everybody di d. Ye-Ye-Ye Œ 

I remember t hat even as a child, if you Œ if you wanted to Œ th-the Œ the bully boys,

who went i nto the store. And they would economically get back to Œ at them. And 
of course, 
Hitler
 passed all kinds of laws; one in particular had affected m y father, 

that if you owed any debts to a Jew, you didn™t have to pa y back. So m y father, his 

business depended on the Œ the crop next summer, you know. If a farmer bought a 

cow from hi m, he woul d pa y the debt back maybe a Œ when the Œ when the crops 
came in. So Œ so a lot of those farmers stopped doing any business with my father, 
because the y decided that the law allowed them not to pa y m y father back. And Œ 

and I remember, I have this one very vivid memory of waking up like one, two i n 

the morning. We had like a bell, an old fashioned bell which you pull , in front of 

our house. And the bell  pulled, and I went to t he window, I woke up, and I saw a 

farmer standing there, with a cow. Because he did not Œ he wanted to transact a sale,

yes.
 
Q: Œ whether or not  there™s something more personal when it happens in a smaller

A: Oh, oh, so you Œ first of all, I wasn™t there at Crystal Night, that™s in ™38 Œ 
Q: Right Œ  
A: Œ we left in ™36. 

Q: Œ you had gone. 
A: But, the Œ 
the Nazism wasextremely

A: Yeah. And Œ and Œ a-and, you know, t he Jews were Œ they becam e targeted 
much later. My Œ his wife, m y aunt, went t o medical school in 
Würzburg

was much l ater before she had to drop out of medical school. So a Œ but, on the

other hand, I had a relationship with none Œ 
wi th m y 
Œ with German fr-friends, that 
was very strong, in the pre Œ in the pre-
Hitl er
 
Germany
. We had chil dren living all 
along our street. That™s why I didn™t have a th Œ I can™t remember much of a Jewish 
community, other t han going to the s Œ to the synagogue to pra y. I Œ t here was very 

little pla ying that I did with Jewish kids, because a Œ 
because m y 
Œ the community 
of Œ 
m y 
chi ld Œ community wasn™t  even in the class, it was m y street, you know, 
that was m y neighborhood. And Œ and I Œ  if I Œ I think back, I can™t remember many 

classmates i n a cl Œ who I would walk to the school and back from. I can™t 

remember that kind of friendship. I remember more the friendship, the Œ the 

convenient Œ the friendship of convenience, you know, right on Œ 
at m y street. 
 

Q: When you 
Œ when you told your experi ences to your former classmat es when 
you went back Œ 
A: Mm-hm. 
Q: Œ did the y all remember you personally? 

A: Well, that™s a good question. And the way that it works Œ worked, the y woul d 

not have recognized m e. We all Œ they all sported their class photo. Th-They Œ in 

Germany
, youtake your 
Œ 
if you™re 
Œ you™re i n the cla Œ I was in the class of 1925, 
which meant I was born in 1925, you know. 

Q: Right. 

 
Interview with Shimon Schwarzschild

A: And Œ and Œ and ev Œ I™m not sure whether it was every year, but in the fourth 
grade, when I left, there was a class photo. And when I came back, everyone had a f 

Œ as I did, I had one too, I had a photo, and we would point to each other, to re Œ to 

Œ to Œ to try to remember who we each were. I would not  Œ I would not have 

remembered any of Œ I would not have remembered any of them. 
Q: Oka y. 
A: The y had a speci al reunion for me. That ™s the other thing they™re big on, they Œ 

in other words, the y didn™t just Œ they had it for me, but every year t hat class had Œ 

has a reunion. Now Œ now they don™t, because it™s down to one classmat e, you 

know, 
Rudolf
(ph)
 Streichorn
(ph). But Œ but when I went back for t hat, what I call 

group therapy meeting Œ 

Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ 
there was 
Œ 
they hadaspecial meeting to 
Œ 
forme, my classmates,which m y 
friend Œ which 
Rudolf
(ph) 
Streichorn
(ph) arranged to Œ i nvited t hem all, an-and I 
would not have ri Œ I would not have recognized one single one. And even when I 

look Œ looked Œ to be very truthful, when I looked at the picture, I didn™t Œ 
there was 

not strong memory, because the children I played with in a more soli d wa y, were 

most of the children who Œ who l ived along m y street, and I don™t think any of

them, except for 
Streichorn
(ph), lived on my street. He lived right there. He still 
lives there. He lived right around t he corner from me. 
Q: And thi s is the one whose father was a social democrat? 

A: No. 

Q: That™s somebody else. 
A: This is the one who was Œ became a prisoner of war in 
Russi a
. 
Q: I thought that was t he one who was Œ 

A: Oh, kar Œ well, 
Karl Stahl
(ph), yes. But 
K arl Stahl
(ph), he didn™t go Œ he was Œ 
he was older, he was more like my Œ m y brother™s age, and Œ and Œ and you know, 
because I Œ 
I 
Œ you know, we talk about conflict, I had that  conflict, i n a sense, with 

m y brother. You know, his friends were his friends, you know. And even though we 

Œ we Œ 
youknow, we wouldgo on 
stilts together, and we would Œ but Œ but Œ but I 
had m y litt le circle, and m y brother had his own circle. And he had a larger circle 

than I did. When I Œ if I went a Œ if I want to l ook for grounds for jealousy, you 

know. We be 
Œ he and I had a hard ti me wi th each other at that age, but we became 
very, very cl ose. 

Q: Later?  

A: Later, yeah. 

Q: Yeah. 

 
Interview with Shimon Schwarzschild  
 
April 23, 2017

A: We were very close. 
Q: So I Œ I guess one thing I wanted to establish, if that is actually the case. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: The chil dren that Œ t he former children t hat you met Œ 

A: Yeah. 
Q: Œ when the y had that annual meeting Œ 
A: Yes
,  yes
. 
Q: It wasn™t that Œ things that they had personally done t hat you remembered. 
A: No. 

Q: It is that the y di dn™t know what  your experi ences were, and you were probably 

the only classmate to come back and tell them. 

A: No, and it™s probabl y a lot of unfinished business on m y part, which I can never 
finish, because they™re al Œ they™re almost all dead. I never really explored who t he y 
each were.
 
Q: Well, for some people that Œ 

A: When I think about it. 

Q: Œ yeah. Some people would sa y, I don™t care who the y were. 

A: Yeah. 

 
Interview with Shimon Schwarzschild  
 
April 23, 2017

Q: And that™s another question I have to you, is what do you say to those who sa y, I 
don™t want to go back. I Œ I™m writing them off, that™s it. 

A: Well 
Œ 
Q: Whatdo yousa y to them?
 
A: Well, I Œ it™s close t o home. For example, m y brother, you know. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: Who would Œ who did not want  to go back i n any shape or form. And Œ and Œ 

and Œ and I think that Œ I think what allowed me to go back easier than m y brother, 

is I didn™t have the Œ the more advanced, and adult memories that he had, and the 

more recent memories that he had. I think that he was turned off when he went back 

to 
Werthei m
. 
Q: As a 
G
.
I
.?  
A: That™s ri ght. 

Q: It was ri ght Œ right at the end of the war, yes. 

A: That™s ri ght, that™s right. 

Q: Yes. 

A: A-And Œ and Œ and his exper Œ he did Œ  there were not t hat many experience. He 

hadonevery powerful experience,t hat might beworth mentioni ng.
 
Q: Sure. 

 
Interview with Shimon Schwarzschild

A: And Œ and Œ and he w Œ he Œ he was the translator for his infantry battalion, 
because he spoke German, of course. And he was a medi cal aid person, that was his 

job with the battali on, but he was also a Œ a translator. And when he went back to 

Fra nkfurt
, when t he y occupied 
Fra nkfurt
, a Œ a man came runni ng up, or walking 
up to hi m, and introduced himself, and sai d, I Œ I Œ I would like to ask you for help. 
And the man identified hi mself, his name was 
Becker
, and he Œ he had a Jewish 
wife, which he was forced Œ which he did not divorce. What happened, in the jew Œ 
is he was a Œ a judge with 
ver
 
Baden
-Württemberg
. And when the Nazis asked 
hi m to divorce his wife, he refused to do it . They stripped hi m of his office, and he 

became a factory worker, and they took his wi fe away to a concentrat ion camp. And 

so he Œ when he asked m y brother for help, he didn™t know whether his wife was 

still alive or no Œ or dead. And m y brother helped him, and in some way, through 
the 
G
.
I
. network, or whatever, he found Œ he Œ he found out what the concentrati on 
camp was from him, or from the authorities. You know, they Œ you know, the 
Germans are great on records, you know. 

Q: Are good, yes, yes. 

A: And Œ and Œ and Œ and the y found his wife alive. And he was involved with the Œ 

reuniting hi m with his wife, and the y became actually friends, and they Œ but he 

never went back to visit him, even. My brother had a different nature, I guess, also. 

 
Interview with Shimon Schwarzschild  
 
April 23, 2017

It wasn™t just that he had a different experience, but I™m sure the experience he had 
made hi m more distrustful, and ma ybe paran Œ more paranoid about who the y Œ 

who the Germans were of that day, and what t hey did, or didn™t do against the Jews, 

and Œ and for 
Hitler
. 
Q: When you saw t he reaction of your former classmates Œ  
A: Yeah. 

Q: Œ did that change something inside of you? 

A: Well, when I saw the Œ when I saw pri maril y t he women crying, I Œ I Œ I felt that 

they were experiencing something also, in Œ in Œ in looki ng backwards, in looki ng 

back at what ever lifes they Œ they led. And Œ and that the Œ 
thattheir opportunity to 

make contact with someone who survived, must have had Œ well, it onl y Œ it isn™t 

only must 
Œ had a powerful effect, there were a lot of Œ there were many Œ there 
were manifestations of that effect. For example, I Œ I can™t figure it out yet, but well, 
when we went back, th -the es Œ town, the ma yor, the Œ the friendly mayor sent a bus 

to 
Frankfurt
 airport to pick us up. And it was late at night, and Œ and when we 
came back and arrived, there were, at two i n t he morning, there were a group of 

people wait ing to Œ  for us, and the y had the most sumptuous banquet at two in t he 

morning. 

Q: Who wants to eat then, yeah? 

 
Interview with Shimon Schwarzschild  
 
April 23, 2017 
 
 
 
63
 
A: I know.  
Q: Yeah. 

A: To welcome us. The mayor was there. The women from the gl ass people were Œ 

were Œ 

Q: Was there?  
A: Œ was Œ  wer Œ was there. She was also on t he town council. There were about a 
dozen people there to gr Œ to Œ to Œ to greet us, you know. And Œ and well, there™s 

another chapter in my biography, to give you an example. One of the woman who 

was there, 
Ing a
(ph), she™s still ali ve, and when I went back six mont hs ago, she and 
her daughter, we Œ we Œ we connected, and all of that. And Œ 
and she wasthere. 

And her husband was the special coordinator of the ma yor, to welcome the Jews, 

that was hi s job. He was also a correspondent, and a Œ a newspaper reporter. And Œ 
and one da y, when we got all the Œ we got  all this publicity. And m y first wife was 
Polish Jewish, you know, and we™re Œ and Œ and very much more paranoid and 

suspicious. And Œ 
and we 
Œ I Œ I felt that Œ that we were getting all this Œ this 
welcome mat was al most too much, you know? So I wanted m y children to see 

what total reality was. I want Œ 
so I 
Œ I wanted us to go to 
Dachau
. And I told 
Ingrid Œ Inga
(ph) that we were going to 
Dachau
. This i s the woman who is the 
wife of the Œ 

 
Interview with Shimon Schwarzschild

64
 
Q: Right. 
A: Yeah, and she started crying. And she said, you know, I™m afraid. I™m afraid 

you™re going to go to 
Dachau
, and you™re going to come back and hate my 

children. She was sobbing. A-And there were these kind of things that Œ that 

happened. And her husband devoted his ti me Œ every ti me 
I came 
Œ oh, this is Œ oh 
this is the other thing. This is the other thing that™s hard t o grasp, you know? Every 

time Œ I thi nk that all the people there, whet her the y were guilty or not , appreciate 

so much that someone Jewish was willing to go back and Œ and Œ and have some Œ  

Q: Engagement. 

A: Œ engagement and acceptance. And whenever I went back, the y were maj Œ 

maj or newspaper st ories about m y return. And I have no idea who did it, but one 

day I went and discovered I Œ that I had a wi Œ 
a 
Wikipedia
, I was on 
Wikipedia
. 
My suspicion is i t was 
Friedrich
(ph), 
Inga™s
(ph) husband, who is a reporter. I Œ 
I 
can™t i magi ne. I don™t even know how you get on 
Wikipedia
, you know. And the 
thing that I noticed on there was that it Œ at the end of the story of 
Werthei m
, the 
1400s, the 1300s, etcetera, it sa ys, 
Werthei m
 is the home of Œ of Œ of Œ of 
Shimo n 
Bert Schwarzschild
, t he famous environment alist. And I Œ I just suspect
ed
 it had to 
be him, you know? And Œ 
andon m y 90
th
 birthday, the town archivist did a maj or 
sto
ry
 
o f my 
Œ not only of m y fami ly, my current family, he went all t he wa y back to 

 
Interview with Shimon Schwarzschild  
 
April 23, 2017 
 
 
 
65
 
1803, it™s Œ it™s a Œ a major story of about three columns, of the life of the 
Schwarzschild
 family, you know. And I Œ I probably am somewhat seduced by 
what I see as people w ho Œ not Œ it™s not  a matter of adulation, it™s people who have 

an appreciation for the fact that I survived, that I™m from 
Werthei m
, and 
Œ and Œ  
and guilt. They had to go through Œ and I the Œ I™m sure some of them are still going 
through their guilt trip
, too.
 
Q: Well, you know, one of the reasons that I focus so much on t his Œ and we™ll 
come back t o your biography, is that you reall y articulated some of the central 

issues, sometimes personal issues, emoti onal issues, psychological; I don™t know 

what word s to put on it , that ar Œ that are so universal. When an indivi dual, as part 

of a group, experiences betrayal and trauma, and cruelty, and repression, you lose 

faith. And part of the issue when a person survives that kind of experi ence Œ and 
I™m not bei ng very specific in it, but somewhere where you lost faith, and felt 
betrayal, is how do you regain it back? 

A: Mm-hm. 

Q: Can you regain it back? What are the steps to do that? 

A: Mm-hm. 

Q: What is the price not to regain i t back? 

A: Mm-hm. 

 
Interview with Shimon Schwarzschild  
 
April 23, 2017 
 
 
 
66
 
Q: And so that™s one of the things that I wanted to explore, because you had a Œ 
you  
know, through your tell ing, such a personal  tie. And many people who left, don™t 
have that. Ma ybe if they went through the process, the y could thi nk of it, but the y 

don™t. 

A: I also have a 
sense of forgiveness.
 
Q: That™s i mportant. 

A: And Œ and without that I could Œ this wouldn™t have worked ei ther. And it™s not 

just with Œ  with it  Œ m y fellow Germans. I Œ I feel that wa y about that Œ I feel that 
way about every person, and about every country, you know, I feel l ike Œ for 

instance, I fought i n 
Japan
, I Œ 
I wer 
Œ I saw some of the defeated people on trucks, 
being hauled awa y. They were Œ I Œ I couldn™t  feel Œ even though I almost Œ I Œ I 
could have been killed, I Œ I was on a Œ on Œ on a Œ on about the most  dangerous Œ  
Q: Yeah. 

A: Œ duty you could be in Œ in the invasion of 
Okinawa
, I felt that every Œ that the 

people who were the soldiers, the Japanese, they Œ they came from every form of 

belief system. Some of them who ma Œ worshipped the emperor, and some of them 

who were drafted li Œ 
li ke mer 
Œ like we were. And I Œ and I w Œ 
I 
Œ I Œ I wasn™t 
going to judge them, if I Œ 
I mean 
Œ  I mean, I didn™t get that many people who

confessed to me, and said well, I want to confess. You know, that Œ during the war 
Œ I Œ I have to the boys™ room. 

Q: Sure, let ™s 
[indecipherable]
. 

A: And I should tell you, if you Œ 
you 
Œ if you have to go Œ 
[break]
 
Q: Oka y. We were talking about forgiveness.  
A: Yeah. 
Q: What is it that you wanted to sa y about that? 

A: Yeah, well, a couple of items that happened there, that it Œ I s Œ 
I may sounda 

little bit jumbled, you know. 

Q: That™s Œ  no, you sound fine. 

A: Wa 
Œ one Œ 
one thingthathappenedis one day while 
Effie
(ph) and I were there 
Œ 
Q: This is your first wife? 
A: Œ a reporter came from the mai n city, I thi Œ it was either 
Stuttgart
 or 

Fra nkfurt
. A ma Œ a maj or city. And he came to indi Œ just specificall y to interview 
Effie
(ph) and m yself. 
Effie
(ph), you know Œ 

Q: 
Effie
(ph) is your first wife. 

A: Œ m y first Œ m y first wife. And Œ and he wanted to know about what happened Œ 

what happened in Œ in my childhood, etcet era, etcetera, what happened in this Œ in

this Œ what did the y cal l it? Can™t remember. This initiati ve of coming back. And Œ 
and then he find Œ and t hen he confessed to it, and he said, you know, it™s really 

important t hat I write about what happened in your past, and all of your perceptions, 

like 
Effie
(ph) menti oned how when she and I went to the Œ to the train station, she 

wanted Œ asked me if that™s the same train station where t he y took away Œ  
Q: Yeah. 
A: Œ the remaining Jews. And I s Œ I said yes, an-and he wrote all t hat, when the Œ 
when the st ory came out, he wrote Œ wrote about all of these remi niscences. The 

interesting thing was Œ and it Œ I will re Œ I do remember. I never pursued it or 

checked it further, is that this was a major arti cle, and no one in 
Werthei m
 
o f my 
hosts, of all of my hosts, ever ment ioned it. 

Q: You mean it never was published? 
A: It was published in t he major newspaper Œ  
Q: Paper. 

A: Œ in 
Stuttgart
, or in somewhere else. Now ma ybe the y didn™t see i t, I don™t think 

so, but I think the y saw it. And because it dwel t so heavily on m y experience Œ 

Q: In
 
Werthei m
. 
A: Œ in
 Werthei m
, asachild, you know. And 
Œ and so Œ but what Œ what Œ 
but the 
point I also wanted to make is that he felt it important t o let the new Œ the

generation, to let the public know what happened. And t hat happened again and 
again. Whil e we Œ we Œ  you know, the y took us to all these Œ the y took us on boat 
trips, up the 
Rhi ne
 river, this is the ho Œ the host Œ the host committee, you know. 
Oka y. 
[sirens] 

Q: I hate that noise. 
A: The Œ the host committee Œ 
Q: Waita minute, wait aminute,waita mi nute. 
[brea k]
 I™m doing bad things. 
Oka y, fine. Oka y, now we can roll. 

A: Oka y. 

Q: It was t hat noise. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Oka y, we™re rolli ng? All right. 
A: Anywa y, I start sayi ng the host  commi ttee Œ 
Q: So that the Œ the Œ committee Œ 

A: Œ the people, the local people took us on tri ps, on boat  trips, t h-the da Œ returni ng 

Jews, that kind of thing. And they took us to a beer brewery. Oh, a 
Wertheim
 
beer 
brewery, you know, as part of the outings they took us to. And t here were these two 

reporters from the l ocal  newspaper, who came to cover it. And you could see they 

were literally yawning. What kind of an assignment is that, listening to these 

 
Interview with Shimon Schwarzschild

middle-age Jews talk about 
Werthei m
, you know? And Œ and one of them was 
sitting Œ well, they were both sitti ng near us, or next to us, and we started talking. 
And when we Œ when I started describing the Œ 
m y ex  
Œ m y experience as a child, 
and what happened, etcetera, the y became so absorbed, that when the Œ it came time 

they had a deadline t o go back to the paper, and they did not want to go. They said, 
you know, the trouble i s that our parents taught nothing, sa y not hing about it, and 
you™re telli ng us everyt hing that we™ve never heard. That Œ that was such an 

interesting thing.
 

Q: Did that help towards the forgiveness? Is t hat what you Œ 

A: Pardon?  

Q: Did that help towards the forgiveness? Because Œ 

A: Yeah, in a sense. 
Q: Oka y. 
A: It was like, here were these young people Œ the ol Œ the old people never talked 

about it, because they were Œ had their Œ they were carrying all their guilt around. 

And the young people, their sons, their children, never heard Œ 
never heard about it. 

So that Œ t hat turned these two reporters on. They were from 
Wertheim
, you know. 
Q: Yeah.

beginning, the y couldn™t wait to get away from these, you know Œ 
Q: Well, at the begi nning, they™re covering a story of an outing.  

A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: Rather t han somethi ng that™s their own hist ory. 
A: That™s possible. 
Q: And the history of their neighbors.  

A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: You know, that™s a different assignment, you know? 

A: That™s true, yeah. 

Q: Yeah. What year was it that thi s happened, when you had this sort of seminal trip 

back?  
A: Oh, it was Œ I think it was ™73. 
Q: I was thinking it must have been then. Sometime in the 70s. 

A: 
Let mesee,there is ™5

years old is when 
Hitler
 
comesto power. And you mentionedthatin theensuing 
years, your father™s business suffers a lot. 

A: Mm-hm. 

Q: How did Œ do you remember the da y, do you remember the incidence of when he 
actually does come to power, did t hings change in 
Werthei m
 sud denly? 
A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, at  Œ at Œ hard. That Œ that is hard for me to Œ when did I first 
see the parades with a l ot of flags, the bonfires, the kids Œ the old Œ the older 
Hitl er

And I can™t Œ I can™t check with hi m, unfortunately.

Jew any mome Œ 
we 
Œ we left Orthodox Œ m y parents, when we came here, it was 

almost virt ually Œ it was already very difficult for them to make a l iving, and it was 

virtually very, very difficult. The aunt who gave us the visa was in a temple, a

Jewish temple, but  Œ which you could wal k to if you had a half hour or 45 minutes 
to walk. And Œ and Œ and of course, we never rode in 
Germany
, on a Œ in a car or 
bus, and so at the beginning, the y didn™t, and we didn™t. But then we slowly, the 

practicality of it was that we started taking the bus, or Œ or go Œ or if someone 

picked us up to go to the temple. My mother kept 
milcht
ig

fl eishtig

Q: Shri mp, yeah. 

A: Œ 
bacon or 
Œ we had Jewish bacon during t he whole ti me we were there. But the y 
gave up every Œ every other part of it, and Œ and in a sense, so Œ so di d I and m y 

brother. I Œ we Œ in m y life, I Œ we all Œ I had been Œ I have gone to shul, or to a 

temple for high holidays. In 
California 
I did it  al most every year, even here, for 
some reason, because 
Naomi
 is not at all  practical Jewish Œ relig Œ religious, rather. 
She™s Jewi sh, very much openly Jewish, you know. We Œ we Œ we Œ we Œ lately Œ 
we have Œ we have Passover. I Œ I™ve been Œ I was invited to the first Passover Œ the

Does that

you know.  

Q: You™re not tired when you wake up.

a horde of sexy women waiting for me in heaven.

yeah .
 
Q: But I Œ 

A: But I Œ but I Œ but I have a strong feeling Œ I have a strong reverence for m y

Q: Oka y. And is t hat also Œ I-I guess, to me, those Œ as I go back t o it
s 
Œ these are Œ 
these are spi ritual things, when you talk about forgiveness. And when you talk 

about a certain openness, and an interest in other Œ and that has that di mension, i t 

comes from somewhere. And that™s what I was trying to Œ  

A: It™s a good question. You know, I have an i ntrospective about i t myself. I™m very 
happy that I have this feeling for Œ for others, and Œ and Œ and I™m not even sure if I 
can attribute it to

wrenched from Œ from m y life, whether it™s I Œ  it™s Œ it™s Œ I think that I™ve 

developed a strong feel ing to protect other people and species. I feel that did come 

from m y own experience. My ow n persecution, I think, has caused me to Œ I can™t

why I was able Œ I t hink I was able to go back to

understand the guil t feelings that ma ybe drove some of the people to Œ there were 

people there who I real l y felt that they were working out their guilt, you know? 

There were others who weren™t, who were Œ just really felt the y wanted to have

pom

we pla yed. And I wish I had that phonograph today, you know. 
Q: Oh, yeah. 

A: But, I remember there was a Jewish family, the clo Œ who lived the closest to us, 
by the name, the 
Fleischmanns
(ph). 
Q: Oka y. 

A: And I remember they would invite us to their house, and the y had a radio this 

big. 

Q: Oh boy.  

A: And I could not get past thinking that t here was someone who was singing, and 

doing the pla ying, and I would literally Œ they would have to stop me from going to 
the back of the radio. 
Q: To see who™s in it. 

A: To see who™s in it. And the y Œ and Œ and so we Œ we went there, but also we 

went there Œ  I remember one situation where we went there, and they would cl ose 

all the shades, and curtains, because you were not allowed to have a shortwave set. I 

don™t know whether that was a Jewish edict, or whether that was a Nazi edict, you 

know, to apply to everyone. But we Œ the y would turn t he radio down, and they 

 
Interview with Shimon Schwarzschild

would close the shades. Now, ma ybe they were listening to Radi o
 Moscow

think so. I Œ I Œ I Œ   
Q: Or the

A: Œ or the

Œ m y childhood would 
not Œ I was not sophisti cated politically at t he age of 10, so I coul dn™t tell a social ist 
from a communist from a capitali st. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: And the y me Œ there probably were some left leaning Jews in Œ in Œ in 

Werthei m
, butnot many.Most of them were agrarianJews.
 
Q: Yeah. 

A: Like m y father, you know, and Œ and most of them came from a milieu where 

the y never went to high school, even. Like Œ  
Q: And your parents Œ d-do your parents go to high school, gymnasium, or Œ 
A: No, the y never Œ they never finished grammar school, both of them. And Œ and I 

don™t think many of the Œ because i n Œ in Œ in Œ at that ti me, high school was not 

public. Even in

A: Œ 
high schools were 
Œ were not public and you had to pa y. And I don™t think Œ I 
don™t think Œ I think most of the Jews who lived in that time, wit h the exception of 
one family, and the y were called the 
treyf 
Jews. I remember them stil l because Œ 

because about three months ago Œ oh, no, was six months ago. I had been to 

Werthei m
, and the 
Werthei m
 
did a major story on m yret urn.The yal soun
-
unveiled a Jewish secti on in the

community of 
Werthei m
. And I would like that biography I™m gi ving you to go 
there Œ 

Q: Oka y. 

A: Œ 
because 
Œ and Œ and I would love if I could get a Œ if that film is available. 

When
 I went there, the director of the museum took me on a personal tour with a 
bunch of my classmate and other people, and Œ and I was very appreci ative that the y 
now had something to tell the story of the Jews of 
Wertheim
. But I felt it was a 
very static exhibit. And I said Œ I remember sayi ng to the director, you know, if 
you™re gonna have schoolchildren come there to tell the story, it  would be useful if 

you had something that  was au-audio-visual Œ 

Q: That™s true. 

A: Œ there, so the y coul d have something they could ident ify with, you know.

parents and great-parents, the y all came from that same town. And one da y Œ 
but he 

did have a Œ  somewhat of a temper, m y father. And one da y, not l ong before we 

left, a Nazi, a Brownshirt Œ they Œ 
the Nazi s were already
 coming i nt o our place. 
The y had a thing called 
eintopfgericht
. 
Q: 
Eintopfgericht
? 
A: Yeah. I don™t know whether you™ve ever heard of it, even. 

Q: No. 

A: During the height Œ during even at that t ime of the Nazi era, even though it was 

the early era, they had a thing called winter health. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: But it was a Œ I had learned since, it was a disguised way of hoarding for the Œ 
for Œ for war.  
Q: Oka y. 

A: 
Hitler 
was hoarding for war. They had warehouses, geographically l ocated. And 

they would come, I™m not sure whether it was once a week, or once a month. There 

would be some Nazis coming, and the y would Œ and you had to cook a so-called 

eint

A: Œ dinner. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: And all of the hypot hetical savings of food that you di dn™t use because you had 

an 
eintopfgericht
, the y would pick up to sto Œ warehouse. And the y would be 

uniformed Nazis who would come. Now the y Œ the y didn™t come to hound Jews, 
they Œ the y didn™t come just Œ thi s was not a Jewish thing, this was ever
yb o dy.
 
Q: So you cooked them a meal?  
A: You Œ no, you didn™t cook a meal. You cooked yourself your meal on a Œ in a 

one pot service, meaning you made the meal in one pot, l ike a stew, or somethi ng. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: And whatever, hypothetical you saved Œ and I don™t know who decided, and who

Food that you Œ could be stored Œ

A: Wa 
Œ he Œ wi-wi nter help. You know, like we pick up cans for people. 
Q: Yeah. 

A: And so Œ 
anywa y,
 one da y a Brownshirt came to the door, and insulted m y 
father. I don™t know what the Œ what the words were, at the door, and m y father 
punched hi m in the face. 
Q: Uh-oh. 

A: And he was jailed for two weeks. And of Œ you know, at that point, all Œ all the 

Jewish people there, they Œ they saw 
Hitler
 as some bizarre phenomena, especially 

in 
Werthei m
, because those people had been there for multi, mult i, multi-
generations. It would blow over. It was a t hing that would blow over. And they Œ 

and Œ and some of them l aughed when m y father Œ and my father decided he did not 
want to s Œ  that was when he first decided he™s not going to sta y in thi s 
environment. And we had Œ we had only one distant relative. It was the widow. She 

was a sout hern Jewish belle, who was married to a distant cousin of m y father, who 

had already died in 
Jersey City
. And we wrote Œ that™s the only American address 
we had. And so, my fat her or m y mother wrote a letter to her, Aunt 
Bertha
, and Œ 
and asked if she would get us a visa, because t his is yel Œ total misunderstanding of

most peopl e. They think, why did those 900,000 Jews, why didn™t they j ust go
, you 
know?  

Q: Yeah. 

A: Even if you wanted to go, you can™t go unless you have a Œ a legal document, to 

allow you out.I mean, after 
Kristallnacht
, some people would flee. And if they had 
non-Jewish friends who would hide them, they would find their wa y across the 

border. But  no Œ normall y, you couldn™t go. So sh Œ sh Œ he sent t his l etter asking 

for a visa, and she had to get it translated, she Œ she Œ  
Q: She didn™t speak German. 

A: Œ didn™t speak German at all, or read German. And she got us the visa. And Œ 

Q: What was her full name?

to have your Œ a bank account that, you know, in case someone couldn™t make a

sponsor, who was 
Ernestine O ppenhei mer
, who 
was a cousin of hers. 

Q: Oka y. 

A: And the y both lived next to each other. And so she Œ well, she was the first

anyt hing? 

A: That™s a story. You were not al Œ Jews were not allowed to leave with any 

money. We were able to have a lift Œ we had a small Œ was a crate, where we had 

some of our belongings. We didn™t bring furnit ure, but linen, and you know, 
belongings of that sort. 
Q: Household thi ngs, yeah.

them in a cold cream jar, to Œ and we got on the train from

And m y uncle had come along just to escort us to the ship. He Œ he di dn™t leave 

until two Œ  two, t hree years later. We got him the visa to Œ to come out. This is t he 
uncle, the famous uncl e I was telling you about. So he came along, and my mother 

got s Œ really scared. And in the last instant, she took out the gold coi ns from the

everybody Œ 

Q: Works.
 

A: Œ doing Œ work ethi cs, doing it  yourself. So we never Œ we never asked for Œ I

did do is Œ  there was a bachelor relat ive, who l ived in 
Jersey City
 also, and she 
didn™t invi te us int o her beautiful home, for whatever reason, you know. But he was 

a bachelor, and he had an apart ment . So, for the first two or three months, we were 

live Œ able t o live i n a Œ  in Œ in Œ i n Œ in a smal l room that he had i n the apart ment. 

And she al so believed strongly in starting school right awa y. So, two days after we

school nearby. We enrolled, and we started school.

A: Œ of

A: So he was in the occupation of

I was German, ma ybe because of fate, they sent me Œ I Œ I was put on a ship, I was 
assigned to a ship that was in the Œ in the 
Paci fic
. 
Q: Did you Œ 

A: Oh, I di dn™t Œ I Œ I didn™t go right awa y. What happened is, when I was in boot 

training, they give you this gen Œ 
gee 
Œ general Œ 
GCT
, general classi fication test 
that your whole life in the military is dependent on that. And I got a very high

was go Œ I Œ they put me on a plane that flew from 
Honolulu
 to 
Okinawa
, during 
the height of the 
Okinawa
 fighting. 
Q:Oh m y God.
 
A: And I was assi gned to a special unit that was made up of two pilot s, and Œ and 

about five specialist s, radium and radar 
man
 technician, and Œ and two officers. We 
were known as a fighter director team, and we were assigned to a destroyer that was 

called a picket ship, which Œ which goes i n a li ttle circle on the out s Œ they Œ all 

around the i sland of 
Okina wa
. That was the time of the kamikazes, who were Œ and 
Œ and the y were early warning ships for kamikaze suicide planes. So I was in this 

team, and my job was, Iwouldbe inthe 
Œ  
the raid 
Œ the room which had the radar, 
was called the 
CI
, combat information cent er. And I would have a dual earphone 

on, and I would watch t he blips on the radar, and if Œ and if Œ and when we saw a Œ 
an approaching kamikaze, I would man Œ I would maneuver that our pilots would 
scramble from the ai rport Œ from t he air Œ airfield in 
Okinawa
, and my job was to 

maneuver our plane until it would make contact, radar and e ye contact with the 

kamikaze. And then they would sa y, tally- ho, and m y job was over. And Œ 
but you 

know, it di dn™t al wa ys work as beautifull y as i t sounds, because t here were many 

kamikazes who crashed into picket ships, because the y knew that  the picket ships Œ 

these were destroyers, all the wa y al Œ all i n di fferent spots around the island. They

knew that t hese picket ships were early warni ng ships. And up to that point, I saw 
the whole Œ  m y whole navy duty being on destroyers and all that, as being some 

romantic, i nteresting, new experience. Until  one da y. What had happened Œ I hope 

I™m not boring you by all this, but Œ 

Q: No, no, no, no. 
A: Œ there was a terribl e tragedy during the war, that probably most Americans

of Mindanao

and many

of that, the navy passed a special, ironclad ordi nance that any navy shi p that gets 

below 40 percent of its fuel, it must go get  refueled, because of that di saster. And 

so, my picket ship were Œ ha Œ went below 40 percent. We i mmedi at ely headed for

Q: When di d you first Œ well, let me Œ I was gonna ask a question, but I™m going to 

preface it with another. Did all of your relatives from 
Werthei m
 get out? 
A: Aunt
 
Bertha
 
was a 
Œ what™s the word I always use? An angel . And she made it 
possible. We 
Œ you know, we Œ we were worki ng hard to survive, so we slowly Œ 
m y parents were frugal, and the y slowly made some savi ngs, but it would not have 

been enough to get anyone a visa t o get out. So we started joining her, but it was her

initiative that got out my Œ  m y mother™s brother and sister-in-law and Œ and child. 
My father™s brother, and family, and Œ and Œ and one other family. She got them, 

and initiated the visas t o get Œ to get them out. So Œ 
so, we 
Œ our Œ the initial house 
we lived in was al most like an underground rai lroad. 

Q: Wow.
 
A: It was a house with a Œ like a fla Œ it was like a flat in a house, a big, spacious Œ 
had a second and third floor. So when th Œ when m y relati ves came, t hey all sta yed 

first in our house, until they had enough, some job, or mone y, or whatever to have Œ 

to rent their own pl ace. And that was Œ happened in

Q: Ma ybe. Okay. Or maybe there are two of them. 

A: Yeah. 
Q: But I know of 
Gurs
. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: All right. So Œ 

A: Now sh -she Œ she did not live in 
Wertheim
, but she came Œ her husband was my 
mother™s brother from 
La udenbach
(ph). He came from 
La udenba ch
(ph). And he 
was a paint salesman, who worked for m y tyrannical uncle. 

Q: Oka y. And her son escaped from that cam p. 
A: Yes. He and about maybe, I don™t know, 25 children, were allowed to escape. 
The 
Vichy
 guards allowed them t o escape. And they made contact with the 
underground, and t he y were then distributed t o different monasteries, and different 

places. So m y cousin was shifted from one place to another during the war. 

Whenever the Nazi presence became too worrisome, the y would move him to 

another place. And ulti mat ely, he was in a camp in the 
Pyrenees
 at the end of the 
war, and we got him out. But he Œ he Œ I Œ  I don™t know whether because or in spite

of that, he became very paranoid, and he Œ he saw Nazis everywhere. You know, he 
was young, but he was very Œ and he never Œ he never got past his paranoia. 
Q: There are so many victims after Œ 

A: So Œ 
yeah .
 
Q: Œ 
who survived.
 
A: Who survived, right. 
Q: Who survived and never really were free from it. 

A: Well, it Œ it pends Œ I think it depended a lot on the persona, and the si Œ mental 
and emotional strength of the people, because there were ot her Œ there was one 

other ki-kid who escaped with hi m, who I got to Œ I didn™t get to know hi m, but I 

got to meet hi m several ti mes. And he went on to life, and created a Œ you know, a 

pretty positive life for hi mself. But 
Kurt

ma y happened to have Œ you know, it may have to Œ ma y have been a family Œ 
Q: You never know.

A: Œ it was not exactly a therapeutic wa y of living. 
Q: No, no. No, not life enhancing. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: When di d you first l earn of the thing call ed the Holocaust? 

A: You know, I don™t think Œ I don™t think I learned about the Hol ocaust until t he 
end of the war, you know. And I often Œ it™s not that I berate myself, but I wa Œ 
I 
wonder now about the relative insensitivity of our whole fa Œ m y whole family
. We 
were struggling for survival, this was the Depression. And it wasn™t just that m y 

father didn™t have any profession, other than cows. It was like pe Œ it was very hard 

to find any work and to Œ 
an
-and to survive. An-And we, other than t hese indivi dual 
stories that we had, like getting our f Œ getting our relatives out of there Œ 

Q: That™s quite something. 
A: That™s Œ  yeah. Now, the relatives we got  out, the y all were pre-
Kristallnacht
. 
And there was one t errible tragedy of my Uncl e 
Dave
, th-the Œ the uncle, his Œ hi s Œ 
his wife™s sister was in a Œ lived in a town called 
Spa ngenberg er
(ph) Œ 
Q: 
Spa ng enberger
(ph). 
A: Œ I forgot Œ 
Ursula 
was her name, 
Ursula
. And she developed an acute appendix 
when she was ma ybe 17, 18. And the y would not allow any ambulances for Jews

until the morning, and she died, as a result  of the blood poisoning from the 
appendix. 

Q: The burst appendix. 

A: So, we had those ki nd of Œ I remember that personal tragedy, you know. We 

didn™t hear very Œ we didn™t Œ we were not Œ and trying t o get our own relatives out, 
and trying to survi ve and helping them to survive. 
Q: That™s quite a full plate. 

A: That was really our 
maj orplan inlife, you know.
 
Q: That™s a full plat e. 

A: Yeah, yeah. And Œ and I Œ I Œ I found out about the intransigence of our Œ of the 

Roosevelt
 administration and some of the anti-Semitic act ions, or inactions, really, 

much, much later. Much, much lat er. At the ti me, I do know that  we worshipped 
FDR
, and I still have good feelings about hi m, in spite of his failings, you know, 
and Œ and some of the negative thi ngs that he did. We Œ we often go t o the 
FDR
 

museum here in upstate 
New York
. But Œ but we just di dn™t Œ we heard about this Œ 
we knew about the personal tragedies, and we were trying very hard to get our 

relatives out. We knew  tr Œ these t hings were going on. Of course, we had our own 

experience, and that was earlier. 

Q: Yeah. 

 
Interview with Shimon Schwarzschild  
 
April 23, 2017 
 
 
 
118
 
A: But it was really Œ it  really was self -centered. My parents were self-centered. 
The on Œ the only t hing is the y adored 
FDR
, and we had a picture of 
FDR
 on the 

wall, you know. But they were not into any kind of altruistic endeavors. 

Q: You know, I do Œ from your description it™s al most apologetic, but everybody 

who has gone through some sort of hardship li ke this, is i nevitably self-centered. 
People sa y that you can start thinking of others when you feel secure, and you have 
food on the table, and a roof over your head. 

A: Yeah, yeah. 

Q: That™s when you can start thinking of a larger pictur
e.
 
A: Mm-hm. 

Q: So, it sound perfectly normal, perfect Œ 

A: I have to go again, I™m sorry. 
Q: Oka y, t hat™s okay. 
A: This ki nd of Œ 
[break]
 
Q: Oka y. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: So, th-
th
e question was, yeah, when did you find out about the full scope of the 
Holocaust, and 
for you the question was, what motivates people to look beyond, or 
not look be yond t heir own circumstances, if I paraphrased correctly. 

 
Interview with Shimon Schwarzschild  
 
April 23, 2017

A: Mm-
hm. Well, Ican™tremember theexact moment. Remember,I was 
Œ I was in 
the war, I was discharged from the 
Pacific
 i n the early part of ™46. 
Q: Oka y. 
A: And that was already Œ  
VJ
 
Da y happened 
Œ 

Q: August. 
A: Yeah. And Œ and although we were not Œ in the navy we were not deprived of 
reading papers, newspapers and thi ngs. I Œ  I Œ I was not Œ  I was not into any 

political or social awareness Œ I ha Œ 
Ihate to say thatabout myself 
Œ at that ti me. 
Oh yeah, tha Œ that came later, because actually, at some Œ I was called back during 

the Korean war, and Œ and I actually had an incident where I wa Œ where I Œ I pa Œ I 

passed on some political magazines to a Œ a fellow sailor, and he Œ he took the 
articles so Œ  too literall y, and one day when he Œ when they were at  a battle station, 
he said something abou Œ liberal, politically liberal, and another Œ t he petty officer 
in Œ in charge called him a communist, and he punched hi m. And Œ and we Œ 
you 
Œ 
it™s like punching a superior officer. And the captain of the ship t hen came to me, 

and he said, I cannot tell you wa Œ what to read, I cannot t ell you not to subscribe to
 

ﬁ
T
he
 
Progressive
ﬂ magazine, but I™m asking you not to pass it on to other people. I 
don™t know whether you know ﬁ

A: That was Œ that was in 1950, though.  

Q: Did

A: He didn™t Œ he didn™t Œ he told me some stor Œ he Œ he didn™t g Œ there were not Œ 

the o Œ th Œ  other t han the detail of the Œ of Œ of the Œ Mr.

.  
Q: 
Becker
, mm
-hm. 
A: And I t hink Œ 
I th 
Œ I think that, you know, he Œ he didn™t come back with many 
details to me Œ wit h me. A-And, you know, and when I think about it, there are a lot 

of insens Œ things I was insensitive to. I should have taken the initiative and Œ and 

asked hi m, but who knows where I was in my life then, when he Œ when I came 

back, and he came back. He didn™t Œ he must have had st ories, but he Œ he Œ he 

never got to Œ to write anyt hing down. I™m the one who Œ who is doing it now, and 
whatever little I™m a Œ I™m able to write do
wn in m y 
Œ in my memoirs about his 
family, as well, you know. He Œ he didn™t Œ he didn™t Œ there was a phrase Œ 
his wife 
is still alive, 
Vicky
, and Œ and we are very Œ you know, we™re close. She lives i n 
Cherry Hill
, and Œ and I visit her from time to ti me. But Œ but he never shared a lot, 

it Œ with her either, if Œ if he had stories about his German Œ 
his German 

connections. She had her own story to tell, because she was an Egyptian Jew who

Q: It™s not.

know, in connection with everything that we spoke, and t he event s as well as the Œ

you™d want  to underst Œ  

A: And you™re talki ng about m y Œ m y experience in

Q: Your experience in 
Germany
, your family™s experience, and then later, how you 
processed it . 

A:Oka y. Well, my li 
Œ you know, I mean, the sense of forgiveness and conciliati on 
took me a l ong way, and I really feel Œ I don™t feel uncomfortable about it. A-And Œ 

and Œ and because of my i nvolvement wit h Œ with the world™s problems, I ha Œ I™ve 

gained Œ I™ve gained actually, a strong respect for the present day 
Germany

especially t heir attit ude and their act ions in terms of taking in refugees.

Q: Like from 
Syria
, what is going on toda y? 
A: Yeah, and Œ and I saw Œ experienced that  in m y own t own. The y actually cleared 
a building in the police academy that the y used for recruits or what
ever, as a 
Œ an 

area where they took that Œ 
that mi ni
-region took about 4,000 refugees. And they™re 

Œ and Œ and the y™re distributed, not  just in 
Werthei m
, but  to other towns in the area. 
And it™s Œ it™s become a con-controversial issue, to some extent. 
Q: Sure. 

A: But Œ but Œ but Œ but I Œ I have a strong Œ I have a strong respect for them for 

doing that, and Œ and in a sense, it™s a strong respect for Œ for Œ for the postwar 

Germany
 to reconc Œ t o Œ to Œ to visualize the horrors that took place, and to ta Œ  to 
try to reverse any of such a thing from happening now, you know. I Œ I know that 

there™s a lot of political  struggling going on there, as well as every pl ace in 
Europe
, 
and I™m Œ I Œ I Œ I Œ  I re Œ I think I™m moving awa y from your questi on Œ 

Q: No, but  that™s Œ  

A: Œ and generalizing it  a little bit.  

Q: But that™s oka y, that ™s oka y. 

A: But Œ but I Œ since I changed careers, and I Œ I di Œ never Œ I never went on to 

that, I changed careers because I di dn™t want to accept any more money from the 

mil itary, our military. And I found one day I had m y own Œ I had a business with

five other engineers, and Œ and I started re Œ noticing that almost  every purchase

had either Œ the Department of Defense was payi ng for them all. And I finally 

decided I had been Œ I had gotten a salary twi ce already from the mil itary. I didn™t 

want anythi ng to do wi th it any more. And I just Œ and I o Œ I had been an 
environmentalist, so I j ust 
totally changed careers,and 
Œ and Œ and I Œ a-and Œ well, 
I™m getting back now, i t™s just sort of a long way.  
Q: That™s oka y. 

A: And I really respect and admire 
Germany
 for their taking a very strong green 
policy there now, 35 percent green, and we talk a lot here, and we™re less than five 

percent green right now, a-and wi th 
Trump
, who knows whether that will go up or 
down. 
Q: Yeah. 
A: And Œ and so I™ve developed a Œ 
a 
Œ a real respect of Œ for Œ for Œ and I Œ and 

they™re fighting the same political  battles we are here now. The new Œ the new 

Germany

A: Well, I don™t know whether that was the perfect note to end, but Œ  

Q: No, it i s. 
A: Yeah. 
Q: I mean, i n many ways it is, because so much of what your story is, is that leaving 

Germany
, coming back to 
Germany
, the role that it played in your li fe, and how to 
Œ how to Œ  I™d Œ understand it, the Œ the pro Œ you know, what Œ what  it is that you

A: Well 
Œ 
Q: So, I will sa y then, in conclusion Œ unless you have something else to sa y, I have 

a concluding kind of statement. 

A: Well, the only t hing is, I think m y German experience helped me t o be 

compassionate about al l species and all wrongs that are committed. And I can™t fix 

them, I™m only a single person, and I™m in Œ pretty much getting to the end of my 

life. But in a way, in a way, m y experience at the hands of the Nazis helped me i n 
ma ybe becoming a bett er human being. 
Q: How ironic. But it™s i Œ how ironic from that kind of a source, not that you 

became a hu 
Œ better human being, but Œ 
A: Yeah, yeah. And certainly, I™m not dealing with cows. And I often think, you 

know, in a perverse way, I guess I can thank 
Hitler
 for me choosing another career, 
at least.
